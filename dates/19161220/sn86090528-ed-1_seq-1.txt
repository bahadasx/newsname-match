blowing, It is a terrible time for any
body to go about scantily clad or to

in Chickasha who are in this condition
is shown by the calls that come daily
to tho United Charities.
To relieve distress in the city, the

the demands that are made upon us,"

stealing a brand new Ford car from
H. M. Sankey at Minco on December

It was learned definitely that the
boys drove from Henryetta north to
the place where the car was sold, put
ting up a plausible story to induce the
farmer to buy a new Ford car for a
very reduced sum. The sheriff and his
prisoner, who is 22 and lives at Minco,
arrived here this morning instead of
late yesterday afternoon, having been
detained by the long detour required
in order to reach Chickasha from Push
mataha county.
The boys were caught about 250
miles from where the car was sold.
They remain obstinate, refusing to tell j

INDECENT
ROPOSAL
TO GIRL
, School Teacher and Directors Will Take
Boy Back to School After
January 1
The right of a piblic school teat her
to expel a pflpil tor a school term lor
a gross offense and the right of the
hoard of directors to uphold the teach
er in such suspension were points in
volved iii a case which was tried in
the district court before Judge Linn
this morning and which was dismissed
without prejudice. It is understood,
however, that an understanding had
been reached between the mother of
the boy and the school board to rjin
st.ate the boy after January 1, the sus
pension holding good only for Hie
quarter. The state statutes provide
that a teacher may suspend a pupil for
tho quarter for immoral conduct and
that the approval of such action by the
board shall be final.
A writ of mandamus was asked for
by the mother of the boy, Mrs. Annie
Smith of Rush Springs, against W. A.
Newton, B. O. Lindsay and J. J.f May
field, school directors, and J. C. Stew
art, superintendent. The mother I
claimed that without warrant of law
the superintendent had unjustly expell
ed her boy, Emmett Blakoly, who
she says is fourteen years old, from
school for the 191C-17 term, and asks
f"V UIj reinstatement.
The defendants claim not omy that
the boy's conduct on various occasions
had been most improper but that early
in October he made indecent proposal
to one of tho- young ladies attending
the school, accompanying such propos
al with vile epithets directed at said
young lady.

FACES COAL
SHORTAGE
Not Over Week's Supply on Hand and
Railroads Seizing Limited Output
of Mines
THIRD RAISE IN PRICE
IN YEAR REPORTED
Oklahoma Cily Also Facing Shortage as
Result ol Cold Snap and Predicts
General Shtrtage
By United Tress.
Oklahoma Cily, Dee. 20. The tem
perature dropped to eight degrees
above aero last night, and coal dealers
are figuring' on how long their supply
will last. Tho cold wave is taxing
their resources to meet demands.
An actual coal shortage Is feared
In the western part of tho state. The
recent strike of the coal miners dimin
ished production materially. Ship
ments from Kansas City are expected.
Coal Famine in Chickasha.
That Chickasha is threatened with
facing a coal famine in from four to
six days is the concensus of opinion of
I local dealers, al! but one of whom de
clare that with continued cold weath
er the supplies will not last ovr from
three to five days. One company bo
lieved It. could hold t. t, under an av
erage demand, for from seven to ten
(lays.
That tho railroad companies are con
fiscating consignments to Chickasha
and converting them to their own use
13 also evident from the failure of ship
ments known to have been made from
the mines to reach the city dealers. A j
shortage has existed at the mines for
some time and it is the privilege of
the railway companies to seize these
shipments.
Davidson & Case, however, declared
that they know nothing about the
shortage, as they have plenty to last
them under normal conditions for
from seven to ten days and do not an
ticipate any shortage.
"Some time ago, during the last cold
snap," they .said, "a shortage existed
among some local dealers which was
not felt by us and we supplied all the
wants of the public. Some of the oth
er dealers also drew on our stock quite
heavily but we weathered the storm.
We have, had a good steady run all
day and it is noticeable that individu
al orders are much larger than usual.
That is, people who usually buy but a
few dollars worth at a time or less
now order in lots of from a half to two
tons."
L. M. Chase reported that it is a
hard proposition to get coal at this
time due not only to the general short
age at the mines but to the fact that
shipment are being confiscated by the
railroad companies. "A shipment of
four or five cars should have reached
us several days ago," he said, "but we
have heard nothing from them. We
received none today."
Third Raise In Price.
"Added to this is the repeated in
crease in the price of coal. We have
just received noted of an advance of
from 35 to r,0 cents per ton on all
grades, which is the third raise this
year. It is the operators who are prof
iting by these high prices and not the
retail dealers.
35 Tons on Hand.
J. H. Freeman & Sons' visible supply
of warmth did not exceed thirty-five
tons this afternoon, enough to last un
til tomorrow noon.
"I do not believe there is over a
three days' supply of coal in Chicka
sha," said Mr. Freeman today. "There
has been a coal shortage in Oklahoma
all winter and the reason that it has
not been felt more acutely is that there
has been no severely cold weather. I
believe that we shall have to cut our
orders down to a half ton to each cus
tomer." Consumer Are Ouu

COLD WAVE
