COMMISSIONERS TURN
DOWN DITCH PETITION
The ditch case, which the Board of
County Commissioners considered at
an all day session last Tuesday^ was dis-
allowed. The proposed ditch was pe
titioned for by a number of farmers in
.iPWrnstown and North Star townships,
f£' and was opposed by others. The esti-
mated cost gf the ditch, which was known
as Ditch No. 31, was $73,000, with an
1 additional $6,000 if tiled. A hard fight
was put up by both sides to the con
troversy. The auditor was instructed
to collect the expense incurred from the
bondsmen.
Notwithstanding the fact that con
sideration of the ditch consumed a
greater part of the day, the commis
sioners found time to transact consider
able other business before adjourning.
I A petition to extend state road No. 3,
in the town of Linden, from its present
terminus to the Blue Earth cpunty line,
was referred to a committee composed
of Commissioners Roland and Henle,
with instructions to report at the next
meeting. The Burnstown supervisors
requested the board to appropriate
money to aid that township in grading
its reads. The request was referred to
Ccir.missioners Graff and Palmer for in
vestigation.
Two bridges ind a retaining wall re
itly authorized in Leavenworth town
rf, have been completed and are in a
&44factory condition, according to a
T^ort made by a committee that worked
in conjunction with the town board in
the matter. The plans and specifica
tions for the road were made by As-
sistant Engineer Robinsorf. The work
cost $2,292, and the committee asked
the county to pay over to the township
$1,146, being one-half of" the cost of the
work. The report was placed on file and
will probably be taken up at the next
meeting.
The petitioners for county ditch No.
34, in Sigel and Cottonwood townships,
requested that F. D. Minium be ap
pointed engineer for that work, which
was granted.
Anton Brand was allowed $1,365 for
extra work on state roads No. 7 and No.
11, which was ordered paid.
Several county ditches and state roads
were reported completed, payment was
ordered. They were as follows: State
road No. 10, $314.25 state road No. 12,
$86.25 state road No. 4, $730 state
road No. 9, $704.75 state road No. 8,
$93.60 county ditch No. 21, $348.25.
The town of Sigel claimed $135180 for
grading a road in that township, which
amount was cut down to $67.90 and
ordered paid.
CAR REPAIRING IS
GROWING INDUSTRY
UCRTHWESTERN SHOPS HERE
HELP TO RELIEVE THE BAD
SHORTAGE.
ROLLING STOCK SITUATION IS
MOST SERIOUS IN RAILROAD
HISTORY
An industry that has grown to quite
large proportiens in New Ulm within
the past three years, is that of the
Northwestern Railway Company's jcar
repair shops, and it is doubtful if more
than a very rew of the people of this
city known that snch is the case. An
average of twenty men are employed
constantly at the shops, and several
thousand dollars are paid out annually
and all to heme labor.
Three yearn ago repair work was start
ed, in a' small' way^fep^aifTEg^'car's'that
needed to he put in'condition for., flour
and grain, and has been growing steadily
ever since.
Only Lccal Men Employed
John Karl is foreman of the local
car repair department of the North
western, and is mentioned .by railway
officials as an extremely competent man
in that position. He a New Ulm man,
as are all of the employes in that de
partment. The repair shops are near
the crossing at South Fourth street.
In 1915 there were turned cut of the
lccal shGps 18,873 cars at an expense cf
$8,366.59. For the present year the
number and expenditure will run con
siderably higher. Not only were more
cars repaired during the present yesr,
but the work was heavier, many cars
being practically rebuilt, which was not
the case heretofore, only the lighter
repairs being attempted. From Jan
uary 1, to November 30, inclusive 15,
179 cars were repaired, for. which ^9,
608.08 was paid out. Mr. Karl esti
mates that the number for this month
will reach about 1,100 and the expense
will be in the neighborhood of $1,100.
making a total of upwards of 16,300
cars at an expense of nearly $11,000.
Lack of cars in June and July cut the
number during those months, but this
was more than made up in the last few
months.
The local shops are busier in the late
summer and fall months, and work drops
of considerably in mid-winter. Last
year December was the heaviest month,
there being 1,400 cars turned out after

CHRISTMAS SHOPPING
IS NOW AT ITS HEIGHT
Merchants and clerks are now putting,
in the busiest week of the year. Christ
mas shopping is at its height, and all
report an unusually heavy Holiday
trade. Practically all of the stores
are kept open during the evening, that
all may be waited on and the trade
taken care of.
In spite of the snow which has caused
auto traveling to be somewhat disagree
able, merchants report that1 shoppers
are coming from many miles around to
take advantage of the large and com-'
plete stocks displayed in the New Ulm
stores.
Another feature of this year's buying,
the dealers say, that Christmas shop
ping began unsusually early this season,
and has been steadily increasing for
more than a menth.
Sure, these are prosperous times and
everybe dy seems to want to take ad
vantage of it and make the most of the
present days of easy money.,

FREIGHT TRAIN LOSES
THREE CARS AT CROSSING
During the snow storm Thursday
night three cars, consisting of 9 box
ears, filled with merchandise, an empty
stock car and a gondola, loaded with
railway ties, were piled up in a heap
at the Center street crossing of the
Northwestern railway main track.
Traffic was tied ttp for several hours,
while the wreckage was being cleared
away. The accident, which occurred
about 8:30 in the evening was caused
by a mistake in signals.
The cars belonged to a west-bound
freight train, which stopped here- to
switch in a car A local switching
engine was used in pushing it up the hill
west of town, and had been coupled on
to the rear end of train, while the reg
ular crew was switching at the front end.
The forward brakeman gave the signal
to the engineer on the head locomotive
to go ahead, which was taken by the
rear-end crew for them to proceed,
which was done, with disastrous results.

ACCUSED ROBBERS
PLACED ON TRIAL
HENDERSON AND MURPHY FACE
COURT AND JURY, CHARGED
WITH THEFT.
fcNLY ONE MORE CIVIL CASE.
^GEORGE KRAUS GETS $40.00
I DAMAGES.
The trial of Arthur Henderson, alias
James Murphy, and James Burnes,
both accused of robbing Erickson &
Kisro's clothing store at Comfrey, on
the night of October 13, was begun in
district court yesterday morning. At
11 o'clock a jury had been secured and
at noon a part of the evidence had been
taken. It was expected the trial would
be-finished by to-day.
.The last civil case-on* the docket to
tried at this term, the Casey Land
Company against H. C. Schultz, was to.
have been tried yesterday, but by an
agreement it gave the. right-of-way to
the criminal case, as an attorney and
several witnesses were here from St.
Paul, who were anixous to get away.
A verdict was returned Tuesday
morning in the damage case of George
Kraus, Jr., vs. Joseph Kraus, in. which
the former sought $3,000 against the
latter for an alleged assault last summer.
The jury awarded the plaintiff $40.
Joseph Kraus is to be tried later on a
criminal charge of assault.
Eleven persons were indited by the
grand jury. Tuesday evening indict
ments were returned against Joseph
K*aus
charged with assault, and against
Rudolph Rubitschung, accused of
adultery.
Broke Into School House.
Clarence Peterson was indicted for
breaking into a school house in Milford
township. Peterson's story.is that he
in Minneapolis and while there was
robbed of all his earnings, amounting to
more than $100. After his loss at
Minneapolis he started to walk home.
He passed thru New Ulm Tuesday and
started en, west, expecting to reach
Sleepy Eye that night. It became late
and as the night was cold he decided to
enter the school house and spend the
night there. He took a glass from a
window and crawled in. In the building
he found 30 cents, which he says he took
along, because he thought it might buy
his breakfast. After he had left there
and was on his way to Sleepy Eye'he was
arrested and brought back here. The
indictment resulted. He is now in jail
awaiting action of the court.
Accused of Stealing Cow.
Albert Gieseke of Sleepy Eye, was
indicted charged with stealing a cow.
This appears to be the outcome of a
neighborhood quarrel. Some time ago
it appears that Otto Fritorv also of
Sleepy Eye, accused Gieseke- of the
larceny, of the cow which resulted in a
suit- for damages.
Anton- Manderfeld, indicted on a
charge of grand larceny in the first degree,
appeared before Judge Olsen late Mon
day and.plead guilty to robbery in the
third degree. He has not yet been
sentenced.
Rudolph Rubitschung, of Springfield,
indicted by the grand jury, on a charge
of adultery, appeared before the court,
just before adjournment Monday after
noon, and plead guilty to the charge.
He was fined $100 and costs, amounting
to $12.50. He paid the'fine and was
released. ".-.-
In the case of Fred Mielke v«V"Charles
Deutschmann, in which the plaintiff
claimed $300 damages, sustained in an
automobile accident), last June^ near
Springfield, the jury brought in a verdict
of $100 for the plaintiff. Mielke claimed
Deutschmann's Ford had injured his
Buick to the extent he claimed in the
suit.
Gets $5 Damages.
The case of Irwin Zieske vs. Peter
Hansen the jury decided that Zieske
was entitled to $5 damages. The plain
tiff on behalf of his daughter, bad sued
the defendetit, claiming damages to the
eWtetit of $1,000, when Hansen's car
collided with a bicycle being ridden by
the girl. Hansen will be obliged to pay
the costs of the suit. ,*'
The jury brought in a verdict of no
cause of action in tie case of Albert
Gieseke vs. Otto Friton. Gieseke claim
ed his reputation had been damaged to
th| extent of $10,000, alleging that the
defendant had accusedT him of stealing
a eow. Th$ grand jury had indicted
Gieseke on the charge of the theft while

Fargo has signified his intention to send
invitations to the mayor of every city
in the two valleys and also to the chair
man of each Board of County Com
missioners whose couirtyis affected by
either of the rivers' involved. Invita
tions are also to be sent to many other
prominent men, well versed on the
situation.
Dr. L. A.' Fritsche, who is a leader in
the jnovement to curb the flood waters
of these two troublesome rivers, said
yesterday, that it is not intended to
make this a great speech-making affair,
but ra!ther to let the farmers who are
affected by the floods, be heard and tell
the people just what the situation is so
far as they are concerned.
Congress to Be Informed.
"We propose," said Mayor Fritsche,
"to adopt resolutions that will give, not
only the All Minnesota Development
Association, but the authorities at
Washington, an idea just what the
farmers of the river bottom lands are up
against. It has been, published that
about 35,000 acres' of land are affected.
That amount is just that in the Dakotas
while in Minnesota it runs into the
millions.
"What we want the government to do
isto say whatit proposes to do in regardto
the Minnesota river whether it will re
tain it for navigation purposes or not,
and improve it for that purpose. If not
then let it be turned over to the states,
that it may be made flood-proof. When
the federal authorities indicate their
purpose we will know what move to
make."
Capt. Jacob Hindermann of Fort
Ridgely, who was in the city last week,
conferring with Mayor Fritsche, was the
last steamboat master to navigate the
Minnesota river above Mankato, having
discontinued the 'service in 1880. To
the Review he told of much of his ex
perience on this river.
Navigated the Minnesota,
"The younger generation may laugh
at the idea of navigating the Minnesota,"
he said, "but us old fellows know what
we are talking about. For many years
and there are many here in New Ulm
how 'who can remember seeing the big
Mississippi river steamers tied up at the
old dock which was at the foot of Center

by the government troops all of the

NEW DLMFOLKS SEE
PANAMA'S BIG DITCH
DR. STRICKLER AND PARTY ON
AN EXTENDED TRIP THRU
SOUTH.
SHRINERS VISIT NEW ORLEANS,
HAVANA AND OTHER POINTS
ON WAY.*
Dr. and Mrs. O. C. Strickler and
daughter Vera, returned a few days ago
from nearly a month's trip in the south,
which extended to Havana, Cuba, and
the Isthmus of Panama, including the
canal zone, and a journey thru the big _,
canal. They were accompanied by Mrs.
J. H. Siegel, who left the party on the
return trip at New Orleans, where they
were met by Mr. Siegel. Mr. and
Mrs. Siegel went from there to French
Lick Springs, Ind., where they will re
main for a time.
Was a Great Trip.
"It was a great trip", said Dr. Strick
ler, since his return, "and we enjoyed
every minute of it. We left here on the'
afternoon of November 21, for St. Paul
where we met a number of Shriners and
their wives. The party, which consisted
of forty-seven people, left St. Paul that
night for New Orleans, stopping enroute
at Evansville, Ind., and Montgomery,
Ala. where we were given enthusiastic
receptions. At New Orleans we were
met by other shriners from various parts
of the United States and after viewing
the city, we sailed for- Havana, the trip
occupying about two days. The weather
was rough the entire trip between New
Orleans and Havana and most of the
members of the party were sea sick a
greater part of the way. A ceremonial
was held at Havana, after which we were
given a ride for some fifteen miles into
the country, that we might see what

been wrought since the island had been
wrested from Spanish rule. .'--".-
Canal Zone Interesting.
"We left there for the canal zone, ar
riving on'Saturday, December 2, and
crossed the Isthmus by rail, the trip
occupying an hour and forty-five minutes,
arriving at Ancon, the. new city which
has been built up by the Americans since
work on the canal was begun. Ancon
joins the old city of Panama. Sunday
forenoon we viewed the ruins of the
old Panama castle, destroyed by Sir
Jdhn Morgan, in 1671. In the after
noon we made the round trip thru the
canal, and Monday morning we were
taken to the fortification constructed by
the United States government to protect
the Pacific entrance to the canal. This
was a most interesting feature of our
trip. The fortification is built on a
little island formed of solid rock, just
off the entrance to the canal. A rail
road has been built to the island of
material taken from the canal while
excavating for that great ditch. The
fortification is a veritable American
Gibraltar. The fortification is well
equipned with immense guns said to be ,'
the largest of the kind in the world, and
other armament, with a sufficient num
ber of soldiers to hold it against, any
attack. _r
See Sights at Colon.
"The following day we again crossed
the Isthmus to- the Atlantic end of the
canal, where is located the American
town of Christobal, adjoining the old
Spanish city of Colon. They are so
closely joined'that one is unable to tell
where one begias and the other leaves
off, except for the vast difference in con
struction of the buildings, one being
entirely new and the other of ancient
habitations and business places. Christo
bal is inhabited by Americans and others
of the white races, while Colon is made
up almost exclusively of natives. By
observation of these two features it is
impossible to make a mistake when you
cross the line from one city to the other.
"We were shown the workings of the
canal, but they have been described so
often and by such able pens that any
thing along that line would. be .super
fluous from me at this time, I

"Leaving the canal zone we sailed for
Bocas del Toro, at the north western end
