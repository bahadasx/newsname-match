The New Taxing Plan. , .
Glasgow Times.
The new taxing-plan, suggested by
the legislative committee of the last
'legislature, is an abomination in the
sight of tax-payers.
It clears the way foran immense de
ficit, and leaves only the owners of
real estate and farming land to pay
that deficit.
It practically releases all cash in
banks from taxation.
It reduces the tax on whiskey to 40
cents on the hundred dollars of tax
able property and relieves it of all
other taxation. Whiskey is now taxed
at from ten to twelve dollars per bar
rel; under ttlB proposed law each bar
rel would be taxed from forty cents to
one dollar.
Both the e changes in the taxing
laws mean a huge deficit in the state
revenues -a deficit that cannot be
raised under the new law, except by
a tremendous increase in the assessment-valuation
of farm lands and city
and town lots. It will put in hard
lines, and will, if his burdens are in
creased as they can be, bankrupt ev
ery farmer and owner of real estate in
the state.
The Times will, from time to time,
call attention to other bad points in
this astonishing -document a doc
ument conceived in-ain and shapen in
iniquity, and that will, as surely as
night follows day, throw Kentucky in
to the republican column if enacted
into law.
Every tax-payer should at once make
it his business to find out how his sen
ator and representative stand on this
issue. If they will not state plainly
and clearly their positions then a cit
izens meeting should be held and
these gentlemen called. This is no
time to mince words or dally in 'ac
tion.
The agricultural property of the
state and the fate of the Democratic
party is in the balance.

Dead from trie Wound.
A Miss Eoberts, seventeen years old,
a daughter of Charles Roberts, who
lived near the Dug Hill, this county,
received a gunshot wound last Sunday
week which resulted in her death on
Tuesday following. At the time the
girl was shot, her sister had the gun
in her hand, and a report says, she was
trying to break it, when it fired. The
load entered the left breast of her sis
ter which resulted in her death at the
time stated above. There are other
reports in regard to the shooting, and
we d resume there will be an invest!
gation.

Mr. Melvin Blair and family, who

Glenville, It is very hard for Adair
county people to retain their health
in a Western State. There is either
too much wind, or too much sand, and
again the hot winds are not conducive
to health. Here, in Adair, where the
broomsedge, sassafras, dogwood, and
men grow, and the best of water
gushes constantly from the fountains,
is a mighty good place to live. Mel
vin, your friends welcome you and

From Ma". Short.
Ysleta, Texas, Dec. 12, 1916.
My dear Mr. Carroll:
We have been moving down near
the Greasers this last week and just
got both of your letters at once-
Well this is a 11 of a country. It
is December and warm all day, but
cold at night, and the water Is so full
of alkiline that soap has absolutely no
effect on it. I have used one quarter
bar of Ivory soap for a month and still
have most of it. Still jou don't get
dirty. Wore one shiit a month and
then it looked as clean as when I put
it on. All there Is disagreeable is the
sand in your shoes and pockets all the
time. It will work kito the filing of
a tooth, but the wind blows it off you
one minute and back the next. I
bought a fine horse from U S for
$170. He is a 1,150 pounder and walks
right up on a cannon like it was oats.
Can pick up your hat off the ground
with him and I Jiave my mounted
orderly a boy from Nlcholasvllle.Ky.,
teaching him to lie down. I have fif
teen miles of the Rio Grande to guard,
and both banks are covered with small
willows as thick as a cane brake. In
addition to my four companies of In
fantry, I have 75 Cavalrymen and 3
Cavalry officers, who ride the trail
through the willows with rifles across
their saddle horn keeping the Carran
za soldiers back who left Chauhauhau
when Villa took it last week, and keep
ing them from crossing over to the
U. S. side. We also search every man,
woman and child who crosses the river.
Most places you can wade the Rio
Grand, only knee deep and about 50
feet across. It is the darndest little
mud stream you ever saw. I thought
the Rio Grande was a whopper, but
Russell creek is an ocean beside Jt
However, it makes us mighty close to
the Mexican for he can tear you opeu
with a shot gun or an Iver Johnson
that close, but it's his "tale" if he
shoots for cur men are just itching to
"bear down" on them ""
I am having some Jasper and Topaz
stones cut that I got on the Mesa and
will send you one for a stick pin.
TeU Mr. Paull that I look like John
Morgan with my side burns and mus
tache turned foose and when 1 go to
inspect the posts I take a platoon of
cavalry behind me, not that I am
afraid, but there is no use of travel
intr alone when the Reculations call
for an escort to a Major of 30 mounted
men besides the staff. That's about
all the glory I get oufc of it.
We have dug trenches atall the
posts and instead of filled drill every
day, we have "To the Trenches" drill
both day and night, and our men can
wake up, put on an overcoat, get their
guns and be ready to fire in all direc
tions in one minute.
It's interesting, but lonesome way
off here, with old Mexico within a
hundred yards of your tent and all
your friends so far away.
The water here has to be boiled be
fore drinking to keep you from having
stomach trouble.
Well, I hae a map to draw before
tomorrow, so I will close. Address
me here next time you write I will
be here for some time yet.
Give my regards toallandsitsteady

gentleman who has the confidence and
esteem of the people, not only in his
home town, but throughout thisjudi

Shooting at Tompkinsville.
Judge J. C. Carter acted wisely at
Tompkinsville last week when a shot
was fired in the court room while cir
cuit court was in session, the bullet
striking Wash Carter, brother of the
Judge. He ordered the Sheriff to bar
the doors, allow no one to leave the
room, ana search every man in tne
building. The search was made by
the Sheriff and A. A. Huddleston,
State's Attorney. One nan was found
with a pistol, one load, having been
fired. He claimed that the shot was
accidental, that the pistol went off in
kis pocket. Another report is that
the man who iired the shot that struck
Carter made his escape. There ia a
mystery about the affair, as the name
of the man whose pistol was fired in
his pocket has not been given, neither
the name of the man who it is said
made his escape from the court room.
Later: The person who was found
with the pistol in his pocket, one load
having been fired, is named Wilbur
Bedford. The Tompkinsville paper
says that the whole affair is shrouded
in mystery.
Mr. J D Eubank and family will
leave this week for Cincinnati, Ohio,
where they expect to reside. They are
native Adair county people and leave
many relatives and friends who hope
that prosperity will be with them in
their new home. Mr. Eubank is a
good business man, and thinks the op
portunities for him to fight life's bat
tles will be greater in a city. A few
years ago he made the race for the
Democratic nomination for Assessor
and was defeated by only a few votes.
We commend him and his family to
the newacquaintances they may form,
as being worthy of vtheir confidence
and esteem.
