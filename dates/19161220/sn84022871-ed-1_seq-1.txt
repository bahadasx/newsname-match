Craftsbury Students at the Univer
sity. Craftsbury and her academy are
represented at U. V. M., by no less
than ten students and the standing of
this grpup is said to be much above
the average. Both in scholarship and
athletics this crowd is heard from.
At the, recent awarding of "V's" for
athletic honors at the university, two
Craftsbury boys, Hardy Merrill and
Mason P. Dutton, members of the U.
V. M. football team, got their "V's."
They both graduated from the acad
emy in 1915 and are in the same class
at U. V. M. Merrill, has played right
tackle in every game this season and
has been one of the strongest men in
the line. Dutton has played left
tackle in all the games but two. Foot
ball at the university is on the rise
and great things are expected of next
year's team, as all of the members
expect to return. It is safe to say
that no school of its size in the state
has done more for U. V. M. than has
Craftsbury academy in the last 20
years. This is a good example for
othe.r prep schools to follow in the
matter of sending their own scholars
and athletes to their own university
instead of sending them out of the
state.
Katharine Ridgeway Company.
A large and enthusiastic audience
greeted Katharine Ridgeway Thurs
day evening at Seaver's hall, when
she appeared as the second number of
the Improvement club lecture course.
Miss Ridgeway has a charming per
sonality and a rare grace which makes
her a great favorite with all classes
of people. Her selections were varied,
and whether she was giving one of
the powerful, one of deep pathos or
one sparkling with wit, all were giv
en with ease.
Miss Gladys Cooper, pianist, who
accompanies Miss Ridgeway, played
several selections with skill and was
well received.
Katharine Ridgeway may always
feel sure of a hearty welcome in Barton.
Orleans County Fair.
C. E. Hamblet, secretary, has sent
out notices to the stockholders of the
Orleans county fair, warning them of
the annual meeting at Hotel Barton,
Tuesday, Jan, 2d, at 1.30 p. m. There
is little outside the routine business
to be done, but in a personal word, Mr.
Hamblet urges that the stockholders
make an effort to dispose of the 116
shares of stock remaining in the
treasury. These shares are $25 each.
He also tells of improvements - that
might be made with the money. The
auditors' report accompanying the
call was that 1916 had been a pros
perous year. This report is signed
by W. W. Reirden and Franz A. Hunt,
aiiditors.
An Appeal for Kurn Hattin Homes.
In behalf of the boys and manage
ment at Kurn Hattin Home, through
the kindness of our editor, I wish to
thank all, especially the different la
dies' societies in Glover, who have re
sponded so generously to my little
note in the Monitor last week in re
gard to contributions for the home.
There are still two more days. Boys,
haven't you got a pair of skates, or
some fairly good wearing apparel you
have outgrown, to hand me? There
are 80 boys at this home from seven
to 17 years old, and they can use al
most anything. They are all now in
quarantine on account of scarlet fe
ver. You will enjoy' your Christmas tree
or unloading your stocking much more
if you can know you have made happy
some poor boy, who perhaps has no
home, father or mother.

FEEDING THE LAYERS.
Some of the Essential Factors Ex
plained. (This article was intended for last
Week's agricultural issue but was re
ceived to late to permit its use.)
There are three classes of people
keeping hens. First, there are some
who keep hens; second, there are
some whose hens keep them; third,
this class neither make nor lose, in
other words, just break even. Now
it is the people in the first and third
classes that have prompted the wri
ter to write this article, endeavoring
thereby if possible to help pull the
loser out of the rut upon firm ground
again. )
One of the four great drawbacks
in poultry keeping which is holding
so many from success is the feeding
problem. This handicap coupled with
the exceedingly high cost of our
poultry feeds makes it a serious prob
lem, especially for those who
have many hens. However, high
grain prices are not so serious a
question with the poultry man as it
is to the dairy man, because the
American hen is the most efficient
user of feeds of any of our farm ani
mals. Therefore, what we must do
is to feed a good balanced ration to
a flock of selected hens, endeavoring
to get the fall and winter egg, which
sells today at 65 to 75 cents or more
per dozen, rather than by not feeding
a balanced ration, be compelled to
wait until spring when everyone's
hens are laying and then sell the
eggs at 20 to 25 cents or less.
The question is not, can we afford
j to feed a balanced ration, but rather
can we afford not to feed a good bal
! aneed ration.

yet. Subject, "The Other Side," text,

sermon was the brotherhood of man
and individual responsibility.

Every person is a composite of his friends.
This paper is a composite of its friends.
At this Christmas time the Publisher of this paper
looks back over the year and realizes cannot help
realizing how much this paper has been made by
other people how much this paper is a composite
of its subscriber-friends and of its advertiser-friends.
They, in reality have been this paper.
You, whoever you are, if you read or use this
paper, are partners in its success. You are a part of its
composite. Each issue of this paper is a reflection of
this community, especially of that part of this com
munity which is most friendly to these pages.
Without your friendly co-operation and encour
agement, without your good suggestions, without
your warm appreciation of our efforts, this paper
could not be. ?)
So we feel close to you at this time. We want
now, at this Christmas time, to reflect back to you,
even though weakly, some part of the appreciation
you have given to us through the year. For we believe
Appreciation is the salt that savors the work of the
world and keeps it from going sad and stale.
Also, this is a time of life-reviewing and love
getting and ideal-resolving. And we confess to our
human mold and make-up. We have made mistakes ;
but we did not plan them out. They just came. So
it comes that we resolve to jdo bigger and better things
for the year to come. For we know that in so doing
we shall flood new rivers of usefulness and happi
ness YOUR way.
Then, perhaps, we may become a better and
greater part of that great composite which is this
community.
You have been a part of us, for which we are
thankful. In return, we are hoping that the coming
year we may be more of a contribution to that com
posite which is YOU.
Barton Academy and
Graded School
TRAINING CLASS NOTES
Mobile, Ala., Nov. 29, 1916.
Miss Helen M. Carter.
Dear friend:
Your interesting letter was receiv
ed and read with much pleasure. We,
the education class, too, will enjoy
corresponding with you and your
class. It is quite a coincidence that
our school also, is called Barton
Academy. It was named after Mr.
Willoughby Barton, a member oi tne
Alabama Legislature, that passed a
bill providing for the school. He se
cured its present site in the princi
pal part of the city.
I am not the president of the jun
ior class, but a member of the teach
er's training class, and I was cho
sen by the class to reply to you. Our
class is composed of fourteen girls,
ten seniors and four post graduates,
of which I am one. Our text books
are: Colgrove," The School and Teach
er," and Colvin and Bagley, "Hu
man Behavior." We are at present,
taking up arithmetic, but in the course
of the year, will take up all the gram
mar grade subjects, preparing for the
State examination for teachers. A
part of our work is to visit grades in
the different schools. Later we ex
pect to get a little practice before re
ceiving a permanent place. Our
work is most interesting, please tell
me all about yours.
Alabama is a beautiful and luxu
riant state, with an ideal climate.
The northern part is very hilly. The
state is divided into two regions, the
mineral and non-mineral. The for
mer which is in the northern part con
sists of the Tennessee valley, the coal
fields, the Coosa valley, and the Pied
mont plateau, ,''?e latter which is in
the southern tart, consists of the
mixed pine and hardwood belt, the
central prairie or black belt and the
long-leaf pine belt. The product map
which we are sending is divided in
this way: Montgomery, our capital, is
a beautiful city; while Birmingham, a
great mining center, has some of the
tallest skyscrapers in the south. Mo
bile Bay, is a large shipping port.
