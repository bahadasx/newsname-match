Preparations Going Ahead
For The Doll and Toy
Event Skeduled For
Saturday
Only twenty-four hours remain
before the Doll and Toy Fund closes
and it is lacking $40.75 to make it
what it ought to be. There are # a
number of big-hearted men in Mor
gan City whose check could be sent
soon in the morning for that amount
and let the fund be two hundred dol
lars. If you are too modest to see
your name in print the check
will be secretly and gratefully recei
ved and "Anonymous" will be
credited to the amount.. This is the
last appeal for the poor Kiddies of
Morgan City for the Xmas of the
year 1916.
All funds contributed to The
Re.
view Doll and Toy Fund will be dis
bursed by The King's Daughters of
this city. The Peoples State and Sav
ings Bank is the place of deposit for
the Fund but contributions will be
accepted by the banks of Morgan

ness men. Be certain that your name

NO PEACE WITH GUNS
London, Dec. 19.—"Tell us your
terms.
Give us guarantee for the peace
of Europe from the swash-buckling
of Prussian militarism—guarantees
surer than those you have broken.
"Then, and not until then, will
the Allies treat with you with re
gard to ending the war."
Reduced to its sum and substance,
that is the answer of England and
her Allies to the Central Powers to
enter negotiations for peace. It was
given by Lloyd George this after
noon in the House of Commons.
As f° r the Allies' terms—the only
terms of which they will give peace
negotiations a thought—the Premier
se t them down thus:
"Without reparation, peace is im
possible. The Allies insist that the
only end of the was must be com
plete guarantee against Prussian
militarism disturbing the peace of
Europe."
And with a ringing note of bitter
irony he added:
"All the outrages on land and sea
cannot be liquidated by a few pious
phrases about humanity.
At the pinnacle of his political
career in h» debut before the House
vir
^al War Director of England
Lloyd George delivered his long ex
P e cted address before a , house
Parliament as Premier and
thronged to its capacity and amid
deep, almost reverential silence
which was, however, broken repeat
edly by thunderous cheering.
Children take BALLARD'S HORE
HOUND SYRUP willingly because it
tastes nice. There isn't a better rem
ed y anywhere for children's coughs,
hoarseness and bronchitis. It's a
g° od medicine and easy to take.
Price. 25c, 50c, and $1.00 per bottle.

NEW YORK AT NIGHT
Is the name of the pl^y that will
be presented tonight at the Evange
line by the New York Producing
Co., a company of 25 people, in
cluding a bevy of bright, sparkling
girls. It is a musical comedy filled
with non-sensical frolics interming
led with snappy and tuneful melo
dies. It will reveal a side of New
York life that is hard to catch on
and yet is a matter of nightly fact
with a certain class of the popula
tion of that great city. If you want
to enjoy a clean, lively musical pro
duction, be at the Evangeline to
night and get there early as to
have your usual seat. "The
ac tress of Pearl White will be shown
between the acts of the New York
offering. Don't forget that "New
York at night is not a moving pic
ture but a stage play acted by ac
tors and actresses of flesh and
blood.
