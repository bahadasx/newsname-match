shouting and singing into New York
to-day after six months of ret vice on

from xneir cars at tho Krlo terminal
behind a guidon, tattered by the

rated tnto groups to soo that the
complex property of a Signal, outfit
was properly brought to the armories.
A Company sent Its miniature, gen

egrnph Instruments, wire, cots, chairs
nnd nil sorts of tools und nn endless
variety of llttlo nrllclcs to get safely
on the trucks.
At tho armories dozens of men nnd
women camo to greet tho returning

ACTION
By Carl W. Ackerman.
13URLIN, Dec. 20. (United Press.) Germany regards speeches .o
statesmen In L-ngland, France and Russia as a bluff to Impress Berlin with)
the lintente's determination. The Entente Governments cannot do othr
wise in view of their past statements although they are really anxious
now for peace. . f
This was thevlety reflected In all walks of life to-day-following
Premier Lloyd George's answer to the Imperial German Chancellor in
his speech of yesterday. Berlin is not pessimistic, despite this London
statement, added to the previous pronunciamentos from Petrograd and
Paris that the allies are determined to continue the war until their high
objects are attained. The general view was that these speeches are not
to be taken seriously when weighed against Germany's progress la,
Roumania.
Not only was this. the public view, but officials coincided. One offW
cial declared that no belligerent would ever ask a neutral nation to begin
negotiations nevertheless steps by a neutral now would not be regarded
as unfriendly to the Central Powers. Me added that the public state of
mind is not such now that American interference would be welcomed.

The Guardian says that as tfea

this attitude." The Guardian notea
that the apaeoh, contained no hint ot

"What we hare had to fear mttt
