Christmas Celebration
in City.
Christmas procramF will be observed
in tlie High and the city schools
on Friday of this week when the
schools close for n period of ten days
for the Christmas holidays. The
schools will reconvene on January 2.
It had hern the custom heretofore
to eive the schools of rhp rlfv two
weeks holidays at the Christmas season.
hut owing to the fact flint the
schools were late in starting because
of the epidemic of infantile paralysis
which was prevalent throughout the
country at that time, the Board oi
Education deemed it wiser to mak??
up a few days at this time? rather than
run the school so late into the summer.
The Senior Hass of the Fairmont
High school will have charge of the
Chapel period on Friday morning ami
the program will be in the nature of
a celebration of Christmas.
The ward schools will hold their
programs on Friday afternoon and unusual
preparations have been mlide
for the entertainment in a number of
the schools. At the White school the
pupils of the Fifth grade under the
direction of their teacher. Miss Louise
Leonard, will give a play. The friends
and patrons of the school? are cordially
invited to any of these entertainments.
