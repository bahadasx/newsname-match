Twenty Air Battles Are Fought

"WITH THE BRITISH ARMIES IN
FRANCE, Dec. 19. via London, Dec.
20.?Out of a group ot German prisoners
taken on one section of the
British front on Sunday only a noncommissioned
officer had heard anything
of the German emperor's peace
proposal. This circumstance coupled
with the fact that there had been absolutely
no demonstration from any
part of the German trenches caused
much speculation among the British
officers as to whether, despite the emperor's
address to his troops, the new
peace overtures had been permitted
to reach the men actually engaged on
the fighting line.
Documents captured in the last few
days repeatedly mentioned the audacity
and initiative of the Allied
airmen, and Field Marshal von Hindenburg
is quoted as having issued
orders that the supremacy of the air
must be sharply contested. According
to these documents the German
chief of staff has ordered that where
ihe German lines are crossed by hostile
aviators, German machines must
penetrate an equal distance over the
Allied lines. There has been only
a few hours ot good flying weather
in the last week but numerous combats
have token place, twenty being
fought in one forenoon on a certain
sector.
German artillery has recently been
quite active and has responded more
frequently to the continuous British
fire. According to prisoners ' the
preponderance of British shells has
depressed the German troops in the
trenches who thought their own artillery
was not supporting them with
the same vigor as the support the
English gave to their men.

Are Being Put on All Through
Trains to Take Care of
Heavy Travel.
Travel is unusually heavy on all .
roads this week, and the Baltimore I
and Ohio officials are taking their
usual precaution to meet the conditions.
Extra coaches are being put
on all the through trains.
During the last of the week, and especially
on Saturday the traffic will
be the heaviest, and additional
coaches will he attached to all trains (
to meet the demand. 1
The heavy travel is making the *
work of the division difficult, added *
to which are the heavy track condi- ;
Hons. The snow and cold folio-wing so
quickly on the warm weather ren- ^
ders the track conditions more dlffl- :
cult to meet In the operation of
trains. The two factors together,
the weather and heavy traffic, are delaying
the trains, but good time under
the circumstances is being made.
The express business is also very
heavy, and the through trains, 2?j and |
30. are loaded to their oanaritv al
most every day, and will be this
week. The officials are taking every
precaution for the safe and quick
operation of all trains.

view belong to the Sereth position.
"In Dobrudja the Russians have
been driven by the Bulgarians until

been shortened about 600 miles.
which is us much as is considered
possible.
"In the western theater the situation
Is unchanged except for local
engagements. The British advance
near Verdun was nothing but a political
demonstration and will be unable
to exercise any influence upon
the general situation. The balance
of the year 1916 therefore will not
be Improved for the French by Bmall

Prohibition Backers See Need
for Some One Who Can
Reconcile Factions.
I'NDIANAPOUS. Ind.. Dec. 20.?
Indiana people who are Interested In
a state-wide prohibition law realize
there is a great need now for some
man who can reconcile the dry ele
ments and thus present a solid front
when the legislature convenes next
month.
The differences seem to consist of
some sort of antagonism between J.
Frank Hanly, former Republican
governor aiul more recently a candidate,
for president on the Prohibition
ticket, and 13. S. Shumnkcr, head of
the Indiana Anti-Saloon League. Recently
a meeting was held for the
purpose of bringing about co-operation
among a number of organizations,
Including the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union,. Anti-Saloon
League, the flying squadron, with
which Mr. Hanly has been actively
connected, and others. At this meeting
It was apparent that there was a
difference of opinion between Mr.
Shumaker and Mr. Hanly.
The Anti-Saloon League has been
fighting the liquor question for many
years and Is responsible for many of
I the anti-liquor laws now on the
statute books. Mr. Shumaker, it Is
said, at this tjine when ultimate suexcess
seems within reach, does not
care to see the Anti-Saloon League
Bwallowed up entirely by-any other
organization or federation of organizations.
Makes Counter Proposal.
As a counter proposal he has suggested
that the Anti-Saloon Ceague
and the state Woman's Christian
Temperance union join hands In the
fight.' Meanwhile a federation formed
of a number of organizations, but
not Including the Antl-8aloon League
Is getting ready for the fight. Just
how the matter will come out nobody
seems to know.
There does seem to be a general
feeling though that It. C. Mlnton,
-counsel for the Anti-Saloon League,
should draw the prohibition bill be- ,
cause he has wide experience, in this
line of work, having been "connected
with the league as attorney for a
great many years.
The Indiana brewers are said.to be
pleased with-the present situation of
the opposition and are understood to
be getting ready to make a hard fight
against statutory prohibition; Stephen; ;
B. Fleming, of Fort Wayne and New
York; came to Indianapolis last week
and it ia" understod he was here for
the purpose of planning the fight. He
conferred with a number of Democrats.
Mr. Fleming Is known as one
of the shrewdest politicians In the ;
state. A few years ago he was a
member of the state senate.
The brewers will make the argument
that the liquor question should
be left for settlement. until; a *const!- 1
tutional convention-is held/. Laying
aside the liquor question for a con- t
stitutlonal convention would"at'lesat
delay the evil day for the liquor peoThe
anti-saloon people are strong
for a constitutional convention, but
they are Just as strong for statutory
prohibition which, would make the
state dry at once. .
One of the plans of the anti-saloon
people is sold will be ,to have William
Jennings Bryan come Into the
state when the question is up. Mr. :
Bryan when he was in.Indianapolis a
few weeks ago * to1 address the Women's
Christian*a Temperance Union.
took the city by storm and was welcomed
with great acclaim.
That the coming legislature will
call a constitutional convention now
seems pretty certain. Jame3 P. Goodrich.
the Republican governor-elect.
Is said to favor the> convention, plan
and. Governor Ralston, a Democrat,
already has announced in favor of it.
There are a number of ,reforms,
Including taxation reform, favored
by Mr. Goodrich, and. most of these
SMI) require a change in the confti???n.
. .
Work for Suffrage.
The women also-wili work ardently
for a constitutional convention
which they hope will give them complete
suffrage. They,will,: also work
for limited suffrage by statute at the
present session.
