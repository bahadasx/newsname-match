LONDON, Dec. 20.—The allies
have not slammed the door on
peace; they have simply said to
Germany Here are our terms;
take them or leave them.
This was the universal British
Ylew today, when the public had
an opportunity to digest the full
meaning of Premier Lloyd-
George's speech In Commons.
The public interpretation was
that Lloyd-George had furnished
Ton Bethmanu-Hollweg an op
portunity to demonstrate sin
cerity. If Germany really desires
peace, they argued, she now
knows how to go about it.
People With Premier.
Incidentally it was remarked
here today how adroitly and
strikingly Lloyd-George had de
stroyed Germany's illusion that
England is dominating the poli
cies of the entente nations.
The premier, it was recalled,
had stated at the outset that Rus
sia and France, acting independ
ently and separately, had reached
the conclusion to which England
wan now acceding.
Lloyd-George's plan for univer
sal national service and civilian
mobilization, molding the nation
Into an army behind the army,
was popularly accepted today as
though it were the simplest
routine of peace times.
Team Work Nationalize*].
The press and the man in the
street reflected the universal sen
timent — "the country's with
Lloyd-George; what does he want
us jo do?"
Everywhere the new plans were
regarded as "out-Germaning the
Germans" In a concentrated, com
munized effort to swing all re
sources to the war.
NO EXCUSE FOR THE
BIRDS STAYING OUT
"If any bird stays out all night
neit year, it won't be because he
hasn't a home to go to," declares
Jas. B. Mitchell, supervisor of ele
mentary manual training i n the
Tacoma schools. "The boys are
going to make hundreds of bird
houses for the parks."
YACOLT DEPARTMENT
Sec! Didn't we tell you there really was such a town! Well,
lirre It In—Yacolt, Wash. Hay Jacobus, a good railroad friend of
ours, whs good enough to send us the picture. It shows the main

resume of Yacolt happeninga, just l)<><nni the big "Bar" sign.
This week, we are glad to
report, the Yacolt News was
jammed with fine Christmas
advertising.
Qlad because, being news
papermen, we know that the
fact means a little added hol
iday cheer for the editor.
From our selfish view
point, thought, it is too bad,
because the extra ads left a
much smaller space for the
good Yacolt, Dole, Aniboy and
Chelatchie news that Taco
mans have come to appreciate
80 highly.
However, let us be quoting.
The Dole correspondent
writes:
"James Condon spent Sun
day at home."
Dole had a white blanket
spread over her last week."
"Mr. Messner Is celling hit
house on the inside and put
ting down new floors and it
in certainly a first class job."
"Dole Is to have a new
bridge across Rock Creek and
It certainly needs it."

BERLIN, Dec. 20.—Germany
regards speeches of statesmen in
Rutland, France and Russia as a
bluff to Impress Berlin with the
entente's determination.
The entent governments cannot
do otherwise in view of their past
statamtnts—although they are
really anxious now for peace.
This was the view rejected in
all walks of life today following
Premier Lloyd-George's answer to
the imperial German chancellor in
hlg speech of yesterday.
Berlin is not pessimistic de
pite the London statement, added
to the previous pronouncements
from Petrograd and Paris that
the allies are determined to con
tinue the war until their high ob
jects ure attained.
The general view was that these
speeches are not to he taken seri
ously when weighed u.aainst Ger
many's progress in Rumania.

AMSTERDAM, Dec. 20. — 'If
Premier Lloyd-George means to
postpone peace until the allies
conquer, then the war will be
eternal unless the German army
succeeds in terminating at an

The Tageblatt observes: "Lloyd
George's speech is apparently com
posed, according to the prescrip

'Lloyd-George's assertion that
whoever wants only to prolong
the war is criminal implies a
strong self-condemnation, if Eng

greatest holiday, and that Old St. Kick must
be pulled down from his high pedestal if the
true Christian spirit of the season is to be re
stored!
But Dr. R«i»ner stands up for Santa Clans. Not only
that, he actually teaches the Children at famous Grace
church here that Santa and Jesus are related! For thono
who are puzzled what to teach their children about the jolly
divinity of the Christmas season, Dr. Reisner expounds the
followiiiK philosophy:
"Santa Claus has alwuys played a prominent place In
the church at Christmas time, and I think he should continue
to do so.
"Just as I tell our little children there are fairies, to
illustrate truth, so 1 illustrate the spirit of Christmas by
preaching Santa Claus. 1 even tell the little ones he Is re
lated to Jesus, for the things he embodien are in fact part of
the Christ spirit.
"And it has come about by this universal acceptance of
Santa Claun as embodiment of the ■world-wide Clirintmas
spirit, that even non-Christians Join heartily In the holiday.
"It Is false to think the church is dropping Christ out of
Chrlstmua, JUST BECAUSE WE ACCKPT SANTA CLAUS.
But it ia perfectly true that outside the church millions of
Americans are dropping Christ out of Christmas. When
they substitute the letter X for Christ In the name of the
great holiday they but express the extravagant, materialistic,
thoughtless spirit of the age.

There is no time like Christ

And what's the "glad game,"
someone asks. It's more a Btate>
of mind than anything else,
though there are certain rules to
be followed before you can really
get yourself into that state of
mind.
You must try desperately to
find something to be glad about,
in every situMion that arises. It
is literally adapting to yourself
the old saying "Cheer up, it
might be worse."
