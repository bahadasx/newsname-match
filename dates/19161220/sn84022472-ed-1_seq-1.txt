form . of .cold and that his clerks and
himself were having a hard time re-
Htgting the malady.
Real -rrip isn't as prevant as peo

"This I a grip-like epidemic," ' said
Pr.. Brown, "but I would hesitate to
call it a grip epidemic.
"Precautions should be taken,
though,' by botrr tho.?e who have and
those who haven't the grip. Those
vho haven't many ties prevent it by
keeping their persons clean, caring
for their nose and mouth scrupulously,
and observing ,the other" onimon

care. Those who . have the grip should
be. careful not to sneeze and coufe-h in
others' faces, or to circulate the gorms
by means of handkerchiefs, etc. Pre
cautions .will prevent the spn-afl of
the ailment through families, which is

SUPREME COURT
DECIDES AGAINST
FIRST MRS. HEFT
Finds No ifrror Hn Decision
of Judge Webb in Su-
perior Court.
Frances Helene Heft, first Wife of
the late Col. Nathan , H. , Heft of this
city, has lost in the highest state, tri
bunal her fight to get additional ali
mony from the Heft estate. In a de
cision handed down today the su
preme court finds m error in the rul
ing of Judge Webb of .the superior
court- Judge Webb granted afcotion
for rion-suit when the action was tried
before him last spring in this city. A:
that time Judge John S. Pullman, rep
resenting Mary Josephine M. Heft, ex
ecutrix, declared the1 first Mrs. Heft
had not proven her case.
When Mrs. Heft &ot a divorce from
Col Heft in 1901 she was allowed ali
mony of $0,000. Afterward she
claimed he deceived her regarding the
size of his estate and that he was
actually worth $600,000 instead' of
$100,000 as" he told her. When her
claim was disallowed in. the probate
court, Mrs. Heft appealed to the su
perior court.
Another case of ; local interest de
tided by the supreme court is the ac
tion of Bertha Blanton of Scranton,
Pa.,, against Wheeler & Howes of this
city. In this matter the court also
finds no error. Bertha Blanton said
she was a daughter of John H. Ger
ner, who died in 1914) after he had
been injured in the local coal yard
She claimed she Was a dependent of
Gerner, , but Acting Compensation
Commissioner George E. Be-ars, who
heard the testimony, ruled that she
was not a dependent, because she was
married, and received support from
her husband. This opinion was also
confirmed by Judge Gager in the r,it
perior court. '
Democrats Are Victors
In Meriden's Election
Meriden, Dec. 20 Democrats elect
ed a city treasurer, city auditor, two
sheriffs and ten out of fifteen mem
bers of the Common Council at the
off-year election yesterday. The
Democrats now - control the Common
Council for .the first time ' in eight
years. The mayor. Dr. ' Joseph A.
Cooke, is a Democrat.
Washington, Dec. 20 The 200
Americans, detained in Syria and
Palestine by the Turkish military au
thorities, have been granted permis
sion to leave by Birut on condition
that they interne at Beirut for, a
month to make valueless any military
information they may have. .
allowed provided certain courses be
taken. Teachers who have already
reached the maximum of $950 may
attain $1,100, it is said, under this
arrangement, and $1,200 if they take
courses.
Superintendent Slawson would not
discuss the schedule today. "I can't
give any details," he said, "until the
school committee acts on the matter.
I prefer not to disctfss it." .
The one maximum idea is said to
meet with the favor of the majority
of the teachers. Some have thought
it strange that after spending at least
half a dozen years apiece preparing
for their jobs, they must take more
courses to get half the, salary of a
janitor who hasn't had any experi
ence with boilers but on the whole
the teachers are said to be glad to
get any kind of a concession' to meet
the increased cost of living.
TRIPLE INQUIRY
IN TRAGIC DEATH
OF MRS. MOTO
' ' ' ' I'
Coroner, Medical Examiner
and BoarcKof Charities
Probe Pitiable Case.
' Following the death of Mrs. Philip
Moroto, 17 years of age, which is sup
posed to have resulted from hunger
and exposureand the threatened fatal
condition of her three months old in
fant and husband, as a resultof the
same causes, a triple investigation of
the case has been started by the board
of charities, Medical Examiner S. M.
Garlick and Coroner John J. Phelan.
The family removed i yesterday
morning from the basement of the
house a-J226 North Washington ave
nue to St. "Vincent's hospital. Tlie
mo the &- died shortly after- her arrival
and the condition of the -father and
baby is critical. No one has thus far
claimed the body of the woman, al
though, it was reported this afternoon
that ' two sisters might claim; her.
-: But the little mlother, whose , exotlj
beauty earned for rher. two -years ago
the; sobriquet of the "Belle of ItaW,"
has 'not died in; vain.H The 'conditions
which caused her death, and may re
sult in th6 itakirig of the lives of her
consumptive husband "and unnursed
babe of' three -months, will never again
prevail for the two surviving members
of the family should, they recover.. .
' Today the board of charities, at the
direction of Supt. , S. R. Gordon,, has
sent attaches of his office ta investi
gate the case. . They have promised to
send the baby to the "Fresh Air
Farm" if it lingers, and if the,' hus
band is cured , of pneumonia he may
be admitted to the stte tuberculosis
institution. ' r
The publicity of the family's fatal
destitution has aroused in generous
members of their race, ah earnest de
sire to assist them. They may raise
a" fund to .help the. father and infant
and rescue the unclaimed body of the
mother which lies at St. Vincent's
hospitalaccording to it a Christian
burial.
Miss Josephine Dillis and Alexander
F. Morrissey, of the charities depart
ment, today visited the single room
n the. basement of the houe at 226
North Washington avenue, which the
family., called "home." In keeping
with official procedure governing such
cases, they interviewed neighbors and
Dr. Francis Carroll went to St. Vin
cent's hospital to take "a culture and
determine if Moroto has consump
tion. :
v Indignant citizens kept the -'phones
at the charities department busy all
morning, making inquiries as to the
condition of the father and 'baby,
stating their willingness to help them,
and expressing great surprise that a
family, should be allowed to live and
dfe in such hunger and squalor, in, a
civilized, prosperous community.
Supt. Gordon, whose office of late
has been , subjected to more or less
criticism and who was recently advis
ed to stop spending his time writing
books, and keep investigators of his
department oh the street, instead of
having them assume his duties, stated
to all citizens that the department
had no knowledge of the case, until
it was published in the newspapers. -?
The. matter had never been report
ed to th department, he said, and
he would have taken immediate ac
tion had the case been called to1 his
attention.
It was stated that members, of the
Latin race, possess a deeply ingrained
love of home and an all-absorbing
love .of family. v They fear that when
authorities learn they are ill or in
want . they - will be parted from their
family and are always loath to apply
for aid in time of sickness or distress.
The father, Philip Moroto, who is
ignorant of the fact that his young
wife is dead, is reported as having a
chance to recover from the effects
of pneumonia brought on by expos
ure, and the emaciated infant has a
fighting chance for life.
This afternoon it was learned that
following a report, he will receive
from Medical Examiner Garlick, con
cerning the death of Mrs. Moroto,
Coroner John J. Phelan will conduct
an' Investigation. Dr. tlarlick stated,
that the family had only recently
moved into the home from which
they were taken to St. Vincent's hos
pital. He gives as his opinion the cause
of the death of Mrs. Moroto was gen
poisoning, and the eating of old and
stale food. The doctor found that
they had .eaten Monday night, a sup
per of stalecod fish, and a v cheap
grade of Italian wine.
..This poisoned them and they went
to. bed after building a fire in the lit
tle stove in the room of charcoal, on

rine following closely on England's an
nouncement that she would not guar

It is thought the effect on the sub

vessels entitled to warning and provi
sion fbthe safety of those on board.
Jfcst where the point of distinction
would lie is a very complex question.
Lloj George's announcement of the
recognition of the agents of Venizelos
raises' the question of what should be
the attitude of this government if Ven

general mobilization "of, labor fpr war .
and the vital industries. Mr. Lloyd
George indicated he meant , tp begin
with a voluntary plan and that If this,
failed he would ask parliament, to
give the government compulsory pow
ers to place all the labor of the state"
at its service. His proposal, therefore,,
follows somewhat on the line of the;,
German mass levy. ; ' "
When Mr. Lloyd George invited the
labor representatives to Join his cab
inet this scheme was put before them
but they deferred judgment until de
tails were given to them.
While expressing the opinion - that
after: compulsory military service, In
dustrial conscription is not impracti..
cable,' the 'labor leaders are dubious '
as to its success, feeling that the' out
come depends entirely on how the
workmen take it.V " ' yXt'-,- '
