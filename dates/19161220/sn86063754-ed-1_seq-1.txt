Anti-Liquor Bills Flood Two
Houses of Congress
Washington, Dec. 15.?Legis
lative measures aimed at destruction
of the liquor traffic continue
to accumulate in Congress a$ ?
both houses are deluged wttfejjgg
The House Postoffice Committee
opened the door to an- h
other phase of the problem to- e
day in reporting favorably a bill J
designed to close the mails ab /
solutely to advertising of anv in- r
toxicating liquors and to deny 1<
mail order houses the right to o
go into either "wet or dry" territory
to solicit sales through the o
medium of the mails. tl
No move was made during i<
the day by prohibition leaders
in the House regarding the con- r
stitutiocal amendment reported s
yesterday from the judiciary c
committee, but Representative
Webb, chairman oiithe commit- n
too nlana in a air tfio* ruloc onm.
mittee, for a special rule to t
.1?got the resolution beferethe a
House soon after the holidays, e
The consensus of opinion in the
House seemted to be that the v
resolution cannot get the neces- t
sary two thirds majority in the d
Sixty-fourth Congress. Even
Representative Webb is not san- v
guine of the success now, but he ^
is confident that the amendment
will receive more votes than it i
did in the last Congress when it
had thirteen votes more than a
majority. By the time the next

The busy old lady was calling c
ing at the wounded soldier's ^
oome. "now did it happen, ~
William?" she inquired. v
"Shell, mum." u
"A shell? Dear me. Did it ex- tl
plode?" c
"Explode, mum?" replied Wi!- ~
liam weanlv. "Oh, I wouldn't
say that, mum. It just crept up
quietly be'ind me?and bit me."

Everyone could see that they
were Newlyweds, and as they f
sat at adjoining desks in the big
hotel and wrote post cards to all '
their friends and relatives their
lovey-dovey questions and ans
wers provoked an old gentleman
near by almost to apoplexy.
Soon the bridegroom left the
room. Unaware that she had
been deserted, the little bride got
stuck on a word and asked:
"How do you spell Cincinnati,
honey," she asked.
"C-i n-c-i-n n-a t-i ho n e-y," re
sponrfed the grouch.

Zeb Vance Fought Monroe
Chinches
Monroe Journal.
Bryan's visit to Monroe caus
ed an old-timer to recall an interesting
conversation he overheard
nearly fortv years ago be
tween Zeb Vance and the late
Bill Trott, who kept the old ho
tel which used to stand on the
entire site now occupied by the
Loan & Trust buiiding. Vance
had spent the night in the hotel,
and on descending to the office
next morning, he was met with
solicitous enquiries from his
host regarding the manner in
which lie slept during the night.
"Didn't sleep much," respond
ed North Carolina's War Governor,
who was always willing
and ready to tell some waggish
tale.
"What was the matter?" asked
his host in an an anxious tone.
"The chinch bugs were on a
raid in my 100m," retaliated the
Governor, "I fought them single
handed until midnight, when
[ went after some reinforcements.
I got a gallon of molass
es and poured it in a circle
around my bed. Thinking I
was lirmly entrenched from the
enemy, I fell asleep. But along
about two o'clock in the morning,^

Below is a comment by Prof.
Massey in the Progressive Farmer
with which a ^rcat many of
our readers will not agree. Tell
Mr. Massey what you know
about such matters:
"One of my neighbors says
that if you kill hogs when the
moon is increasing the meat will
not turn out as much lard as it
would if you kill on the decrease
of the moon. What do you
think?"
I think that if the hogs have
plenty of rat that no stage of the
moon can rob them of any.
The amount of lard depends entirely
on the condition of the
hog, and the state of the moon
has nothing to do with it. Get
the hogs into good condition
and kill them when the weather
cuifc
ow..*, vTiuiuui any aiiention to
the moon, for if the fat is there,
the moon cannot make it any
less. The feeding has more to
do with it than the moon ft is
time tli&^the intelligent men
were getting rid of these old
superstitions.
