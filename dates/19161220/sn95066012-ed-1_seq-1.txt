HELPS TELEPHONE EMPLOYS
Distribution of Funds by the New
England.
More than 13,000 employees of the
New England Telephone and Tele
graph Company will each participate,
next week Wednesday, in the distri
bution of an emergency payment to
assist them in meeting unusual pres
ent expenses.
Employees, who have been in the
service one year or more will receive
three weeks' pay. Employees who
havo been in the service less than one
year but not less than three months
will receive two weeks' pay. No em
ployee will receive more than $175.
and no employee of les3 than three
months' service and no general of
ficial will in any way share in the
payments.
While in no sense a holiday pres
ent, the fact that it comes most un
expectedly at this time of the year
makes it a most timely evidence of
the continued concern of the Com
pany's officers for the welfare of its
employees. This distribution to em
ployees, amounting to over $GUO,00(),
was decided by the directors of the
New England Telephone and Tele
graph Company at their meeting in
Boston today. Naturally, the "voice
with the smile" is particularly in
evidence anions telephone employees,
without regard to sex or relative
rank.
In connection with this announce
ment President Spalding said:
"The revenues of the Company de
pend on the rates for service allowed
by the commissions, and should pro
vide for all expenses, a fair return to
the owners of the property, and a sur
plus to care for emergencies. Their
sufficiency is judged by the results of J
a period of years, for it is not feas-
luie to ue constantly modifying rates
on the one hand, and expenses on the
other, to meet changes occurring in
genoral business conditions. In this
respect the Telephone Company is
entirely different from tl manufac
turer, who from time to time in
creases or decreases his forces as the
demand for his product increases or
decreases, and changes his wage
schedules to conform to changes in
the selling price of his goods and
changing profit of his business.
"We shall make the payments next
week Wednesday. They will repre
sent, not charity, on the one hand nor
a raise of wages, on the other, but j
rather, if I can reduce the Idea to a !
phrase, messages of goodwill, under- j
standing and appreciation on the part
of the officers of the company for ef
flcient and loyal employees In u tern
porary time of stress."
AMERICA'S PLEA SUCCESSFUL
German and Austrian Prisoners in Si
beria Will Get Relief Supplies
Washington, Dec. IS. America's
plea to Russia repeated ebout ten
days ago by Ambassador Francis at
Petrograd, for prompt forwarding of
large relief supplies held at TlenTsin,
China, for German and Austrian pris
oners In Siberia has brought results.
It was announced today at the state
department that about one-half of the
supplies were started December 12 by
ship to Vladivostok to be sent on to
the prison camps as soon as space
could be found on the railroad.
Several months ago the Austrian
and German governments earn appro
priated $400,o(i. which with contri
butions raised privately, made a fund
of $1,000,000 for the purchase in
China of clothing and food for about
100,000 of their nationals In Siberia.
Largo supplies of felt shoes, under
wear and other supplies were bought
in various parts of China and congre
gated at TlenTsin for shipment.

GERMANY'S -OFFER
NAUCHTW1TH0UT
RESTITUTION
Also a Guarantee for Future Will
Be Demanded
ENGLISH STATESMEN AHE AGREED
France and Russia Will Back Up
England and Prosecute War
With Utmost Vigor.
The offer of Germany and her al
lie3 to discuss peace will amount to
naught unless they submit to the en-,
tente allies their terms and these 1
must embrace nothing short of "com-1
plete restitution, full reparation and
effectual guarantees for peace in the
future." Failure by the Teutonic al
lies to give such a peace as is ro
requlred will mean the utmost prose
cution of the war,
David Lloyd George, the new Brit
ish prime minister, told this to the
House of Commons, while In the
House of Ixirds his words were re
echoed by Earl Curzou of Kedleston,
member of the prime minister's war
council. The prime minister said the
Get man chancellor had made no
proposal and that for Great Britain
to enter upon peace discussions with
out knowledge of what Germany pro
K).sed to offer would be "to put our
heads into a nooe with the rope end
in the hauds of Germany."
Almost simultaneously the French
Chamber of Deputies was told by
Premier Briand that the entente al
lies would send a concerted reply to
the Teutonic allies that It was "im
possible to lake their request for
peaie seriously," while the Russian
council of the empire adopted an or
der of the day unanimously In favor
of refusing to enter under present
conditions into any peace .negotiar
tions with Germany.
Tho Russian and Rumanian troops,
who have been, lu retreat before the
Teutonic allies in bobrudja, seeming
ly are now at a point where they eith
er must make a stand or cross the
Danube into southwest Besaialiia or
into Moldavia In the region of Galatz.
The latest official communication
from Berlin says that in Dobrudja tho
Russians have retreated past their
newly- fortified positions in the north
and that the Teutonic allies are now
advancing toward the lower Danube.
Aside from the announcement of
the capture of more than 1000 Rus
sians and Rumanians and the taking
of numerous vehicles loaded with pro
visions, no mention is made by Berlin
of the ndvance in Moldavia.
REGARDED AS BLUFF
Berlin Does Not Put Much Faith In
Peace Proposals Rejection.
Berlin, Dec. 20. The rejection of
the peace proposals of the cetnral
powers by Great Britain, France and
Russia is considered hero in the na
ture of a bluff to offset the reverse
to the entente lu the destruction of
the Rumanian army. This view is not
only that of the general public but al
so of the government olficials.
FOOD RESTRICTIONS BEGUN
Two-Course Breakfasts and Lunch
eons and Three-Course Dinners
London, Doc. 18. Tho first restric
tion went into force In England to
day. Hotels and restaurants are now
forbidden to serve more than two
courses for breakfast or luncheon and j
three courses for dinner.
Little inconvenience was exper-'
ienced In connection with tho two '
first meals. The Englishman's usual
breakfast consists of a cereal and ba
con, eggs or fish, and except in the
more expensive places a luncheon of ;
two courses Is the rule. It was In ar-1
ranging for a dinner of three courses
that tho caterers experienced the
greatest difficulties, but even in this
case few are likely to go hungry as
hors d'oeuvres and soup count only '
half a course and for the two other
courses diners have the choice of
lish, entrees or roasts, with vege
tables and desserts. Cheese with
bread and butter or crackers is not
counted as a course.
The meatless day which is expected
to follow soon will prove a more dif
ficult problem for restaurants which
make a specialty of roasts.
HOME ECONOMICS SUPERVISOR
New Official Is to Have Charge of De
partment In Vt. High Schools.
Burlington, Dec. 17. It Is probablo
that a supervisor of home economics
to have charge of the home economics
department in all or tho high schools
In the state, will be appointed in the
near future.
This announcement was niado to
day by Floyd B. Jenks of the state de
partment, of agriculture. He stated
that it would probably be two or
three months before a person qualifl
ed for the position could be found.

MISS NELLA GRINNELL ANTHONY
Daughter of the Late Edward R. An
thony of New York Dies in Dorset
Departed: On Saturday evening,
December 9th, very suddenly, the
spirit of Nella Grinnell Anthony,
daughter of the late Edward R. An
thony of New York. "Death is but
a kind servant, who unlocks with
noiseless hand life's flower-encircled
doer to show us those we love. "
Many of the years allotted to Miss
Anthony's earthly life had been
passed in Dorset, where she was well
known and loved. For nearly two
years she had made her homo with
Mr. and Mrs. Clifton P. Kent of the
West road. At the time of her unex
pected death she was stopping with
Mr. Kent's mother, Mrs. Charles B.
Kent and had Intended passing the
winter months there in the home
where fhe had been so frequent, a
guest during the many years since
her first coming to Dorset in girlhood.
Miss Anthony had been required to
remain longer in the world than any
of her family. Her mother (Addle
A. Boomer of New llerford) had died
suddenly while still a young woman
and a sister had passed away in
childhood. Her father was a member
of the old pioneer firm of Anthony
and Chew, Marine Insurance Agents
of New York, long deceased.
Upon the death of an uncle several
years ago, Miss Anthony became the
sole surviving member of her fan-.ily
and this fact bad given her a pecul
iar claim uivon the care and tender
ness of friends.
The law of kindness was ever on
her lips. Ix)e was that law, and its
outward manifectation was shown in
her kindness toward every living
thing which came in her daily path
way. The hearts of young and old alike
responded to her affection. Sr.e
judged no one harshly. Even her ro
bukes carried kindliness more potent
than words cf scorn.
Her simple, unpretending gentle
ness won its way to many grieved an
burdened souls. Bad indeed, must
have been tht! heart that would not
render to her the tribute of gratitude.
Humility seemed the next leading
trait In her character. No conde
scension of manner on her part ever
caused ono to feel worldly distinct
Ions that rouse antipathy In the hu
man heart. Her cheerfulness was an
other striking characteristic.
Her Christian faith was strengthen
ed and confirmed in her latest years.
Even as she lived, without ostenta
tion, her death came also. The meek
ness nnd humility so strongly exhibit
ed throughout her life seemed con
spicuous at Its peaceful close. She
fell asleep with a hope fulj of iin
moitality. Her funeral was held from Mrs.
Kent's residence on Tuesday after
noon December twelfth, Rev. George
H. Gilbert conducting the service.
Her body rests in Maple Hill ceme
tery. The pall bearers were Messrs.
W. E. Kent. W. J. Holley, Wm. Batch
elder, B. J. Connell, Theophilo Com
ba and W. W. Fahnestock.
BULLET IN HEART
Apparently Had Been Carried There
For Months.
The big game hunting season has
brought forth a remarkable discovery
that will be of great interest to path
ologists that of a moose that lived
probably for months with a large
leaden bullet embedded in Its heart.
The animal was shot In the woods
east of Winnipeg by B. A. Cummins,
vice president of the First National ,
bank of Pierre, South Dakota, during
a recent hunting expedition. J
In preparing tho carcass for shivj
mont, a healed wound was noticed ;
on tho heart, and on probing a hard
substance was encountered, which
afterwards proved to be a bullet of !
.401 calibre.
The animal was a full grown bull
and had been apimrenjly In perfect
health. Mr. Cummins is having the
skin mounted and the heart em
balmed, and will have them sent to
the state historical society at Pierre
of which he is a member. They are
now at tho establishment of E. W.
Darbey, Main street, who has been
commissioned to do the work.
It is thought the moose received
the bullet in its heart at least a year
ago. Local scientists are much In
tel ested. .Manitoba Free Press, Win
nipeg, Tuesday, December 5, 1916.
Mr. Cummins who killed tho moose
is a brother of Mrs. Frank E. Howe of 1
South street. Ho' has many acquain
tances In Bennington where he has
visited sevoral times.

TEN-CCHT .- MILK IS
PROBABLE IN
PITTSFIILO
Producers Unite 'and Demand Six
Cents Per Quart
DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE TO PAY,
Farmers Say That the Distributors
Can Meet Demand or They Will
Throw Milk in Road.
Pittafield, Dec. 20. Pittsiield's
milk drinking and milk-using public
will probably have to pay 10 cents a
quart for milk, as the producers have
thrown down the gauntlet to the dis
tributors, saying that they must pay
six cents a quart or they will get no
milk. That was the ultimatum they
delivered to the distributors at a
meeting at the board of trade rooms
yesterday, when all of the big produc
ers and distributors of this section
were present. The price applies to all
of Berkshire county, where distribu
tors take the milk. If they don't want
to pay this amount, the producers,
who are fully organized, say they will
throw the milk in the road.
Announcement to this effect was
made by Wellington G. Palmer, presi
dent of the Berkshire county milk
producers' association. William S.
Noble, speaking for the distributors,
made two propositions, which result
ed In Mr. Palmer's announcement. .
One was that the distributors pay five
cent3 a quart to 'the producers the
year round, and the other that they
pay the price that the Borden com
pany pays all through this territory,
plus one fourth of a cent, which would
amount to about 4 3-4 per cent in
sunnier and 5 in winter. Both
propositions were rejected. t
Finally, the Springfield proposition
was presented and this the producers
will stick to. It is that the distribu
tors must pay six cents a quart for ,
milk to May 1, for the so-called max-!
inr.im amount of each producer, also
this six-cent'price for all over , .the1
maximum amount, up to May 1, to the
extent of 20 per cent. Above that,
only five cents will be paid. What will
bo done about the price after May 1
remains to be settled when the prob
lem confronts the dealers and produc
ers. The distributors do not like this
proposition, but seem bound to meet
it or go out of business, as they are
not organized. When this new price
goes into effect Is a question, but an
announcement as to the time will
probably bo made soon.
ARRESTED AS MARRIED
Man and Woman Jailed for Larceny
at Vermont's Gretna Green. j
Bellows Falls. Dec. IS. Charles F. '
Michael, aged 23, of 13 Hudson street,
Iioston, and Rose Joseph, aged 21, of
12 Maplewood avenue, Gloucester,
Mass., are in the local lock up tonight
instead of enjoying their honey-moon
as they had planned. Tho couple
came here this afternoon and hardly
before they had been given their mar-1
riage license by Town Clerk L. S.
Hayes, the happy couple were inter
rupted by the arrival In the office of
Chief of Police W. S .Severance, who ,
placed them under arrest. j
They are held pending the arrival i
of Gloucester police officers here to
morrow noon who will charge them
with the larceny of $330 in money and
$600 in bracelets from tho girl's mo
ther, Mrs. Mary Joseph of Gloucester.
According to the report received by
the local police, Mrs. Joseph accepted
philosophically the disappearance of
her daughter, suspecting she had
started for Gretna Green, but when
she discovered the loss of her cash
nnd bracelets the Gloucester police
were notified and tho Sicilian couple
were placed under arrest.

Division A Wins From Division B In
Grammar School League.
In the deciding game of the gram
mar school basket ball league Divis
ion A won one of the hardest fought
.battles seen on the gymnasium floor
this season from Division B, 19 to G.
The game was marked by fast play
ing on each side but against Division
A's star player. Stoppiellio, Division j
I! was hopeless. At the end or tne
first hair the scoro was 6 to 6 and In
the second half the Gold-Stoppiellio
combination was too much for the
other team. However, Division It's,
strong defense worked hard end due
credit must bo given the team work
of their players.

BOSTON GOES IT
BY INCREASED
MAJORITY
Ko License Vote Fell Off from Last
Year's Total
WET MJJ3RIIY IS OVIR 23,000
Efforts of Billy Sunday and Ex-Governor
Foss Seem to Have In
creased the License Vote.
Boston, Dec. 19. Boston went for
license today by the surprising ma
jority of 23,000, in a total vote of 84,
000. There were 2,000 fewer "no"
vot-rs than In 1915. The majority
was one of the largest in Boston's
history".
High mark was reached in 1905
with a majority of 27,613. The next
highest majority for license was in
1910 when the Fitzgerald-Storrow
mayoralty contest attracted the high
est percentage of the registered poll
in the history of the city. The ma
jority for license that years was
27.122. ,
Last year Boston went license by a
majority of 14,238, while in the prev-.
ious election the majority for license
was 11,556.
Only two wards went for no license,
wards 21 and 23. The result was
similar last year, wards 24 and 23 be
ing the only wards to record a no li
cense vote.
The campaign waged by the advo
cates of no license, led by Billy Sun
day, the evangelist, has been heat
ed from the start.
The liquor interests centered their
activities In newsjmper advertising so
far as publicity was concerned, but
their antagonists endeavored to
arouse support by employing orators,
bands and today automobiles. The
women, who have no vcte- on the
question, exerted themselves In many
ways' to win converts to their case.
Mr. Sunday's secretary, when In
formed of t,ho result, sald.ij
"Mr. Sunday all day has not shown
any particular eagerness to get the re
turns. He has done the best he could
for the 'drys,' but he has realized all
along many of the dry sympathizers
lived out of town. The matter appar
ently Is closed, though we could wish
it was closed differently, and Mr.
Sunday will now go back to his work
of saving souls."
SIGNS OF THE TIMES
Christmas Gayety Betokened In
Street and Store Decorations.
Despite the rise in the prices of
food and other articles of merchan
dise, holly and evergreen will always
