BRITISH PRESS
INDORSES LLOYD
GEORGE'S STAND
r r ; '
E,U,re Na,IOn DeC,ared Ready
for War Sacrifices,
1.0XDOX. Dec 20 -The bulk of the
morning papers agree that Premier
I.loyd George expressed the views of
the British nation in his speech in the
house of commons dealing with Ger
many's peace proposal.
Program Commands Support.
"Premier Lloyd George." says the
Times, "expressed the thoughts and
wishes of the nation and has a program
which will command its hearty sup
port." This is the tone of the comment in
most of the other papers, which hold
that the premier's answer and also
l-ord Curzon's speech in the house of
lords "are moderate in phrase, firm in
time and answerable in substance"
Beady for Sacrifice.
The papers declare that the nation
is prepared and will willingly under
take all the sacrifice foreshadowed
and will face greater privations, if
necessary, to insure those ends of repa
ration and security which the allies
demand from the centra'! powers.
There is nowhere my N.stile criti
cism of the government's declaration.

MAYOR ORDERS
POLICE JUDGE
TO HOLD COURT
Opinion of Court Will Be Dis
regarded. "You are hereby authorized to open
the municipal court and proceed with
the trial of cases." This is the text of
a letter snit this afternoon to Judge
M.V. Spitler of the city court by Mayor
Ed Overholser.
Attorneys Advised Action.
The communication was sent to Mr.
Spitler following a consultation between
the mayor and lawyers, who advised
him that a ruling in the case of State
vs. Simmons before the criminal court
of apxals is in direct conflict with the
derision of JudK'e Doyle, which in effect
strips the municipal court of all au
thority. No Session of the city court was held
this morning. Court was opened and
closed as on yesterday.
"tlltlahnma City's distinction as the
'cleanest' city in the. southwest, a repu
tation that has been scattered broadcast
throiiKhout the country, will not be im
paired," said the mayor.
Overholser Policies to Continue.
"There will be no change in the law
enforcement policies of the Overholser
administration matter's not what course
must be pursued to reach that end," said
the mayor.
"Whether we are permitted to use the
methods now in force or not, so far as
the intent and endeavor is concerned
there will be no change in our policy.
"Our principal drawback has been to
secure trials on appealed rases and
make the law violator understand tha'
punishment is sure." said the mayor.
Food Regulation
Plan in England
Declared Failure
LONDON. Dec. 2. According to
some of the newspaers two days expe
rience of the first food control measure
which regulates the number and nature
of courses served in hotels and restau
rants, has been sufficient to prove it
futile. Ihcy say that not only has it
failed to check consumption hut in
many instances it has increased it. It
is claimed tnat there is no supervision
and that many customers finding that
they ran indulge in several servings of
the same dish without having more
than- one course counted against them,
hae availed themselves freely of this
loophole. Moreover, there is nothing
to prevent anyone from taking a suc
cession of meals in different places.
The papers urge tickets or a tag on
hotels and restaurant bills as in l'aris.
