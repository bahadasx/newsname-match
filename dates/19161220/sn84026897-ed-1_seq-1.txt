Monthly Meeting of U. D. C.
The monthly meeting of the Edge
field U. DC. was held at the home
of Mrs. Willis Duncan, Mrs. Dun
can bein? assisted in the entertain
ment by Mrs. James DeVore.
The meeting was called to order
!by the president, Mrs. Mary C.
Marsh. After having the Lord's
Prayer in union, the minutes of the
last meetiug was read by the secre
tary, Mrs. B. E. Nicholson. Among
the new business taken up was the
discussion of a letter from Mrs. U.
R. Brooks, president of the M. C.
Butler Chanter, ' Columbia, asking
that we assist in giving records for
a grsphonola which that Chapter is
placing in the Old Soldier's Home
in Columbia. On motion of Mrs.
I Pendleton Jones it was decided to
'have the corresponding secretary
write Mrs. Brooks that our Chapter
will be glad to ttke up this matter
in March.
A letter from Mrs. Boyd of the
Mary Ann Buie Chapter was read,
asking that we take some action in
regard to marking the graves of our
dead in the county, ! and that we
unite with the Mary Ann Buie
Chapter in doing this. On motion
of Mrs. Woodson it was decided
that our secretary be requested to
write Mrs. Boyd that as soon as we
had finished marking the graves in
our town, which work had been
nearly completed by the Dixie Aux
iliary, we would take up the work
of marking the county graves.
?A. report from the State Conven
tion at Union was next'in order.
This report was made by Mrs.
Woodson from clippings taken from
the Union Times and Union Prog
ress. Both of these papers having
been most considerate of the Daugh
ters and having put out special con
vention issues whichVere given out
upon the ?oor. The papers were
passed around at our meeting and
were much enjoyed. Mrs. Wood
son also showed the badge, pro
gram, 'and .0 th er m0tn e in ts&\hL tl.ie
meeting. She "brought home to the
Chapter, the two matters upon
which we are asked to vote at our,
nexi annual meeting. The Presi
dent's recommendation that we have
OUT yearly meeting in some central
city where there is good- hotel ac
commodation aud that the delegates
be asked to meet their own hotel
.and the request,of the chairman of
the committee publishing honor
rolls, that we do not go to the Leg
islature asking for money with
which-to publish our rollR, but that j
we ask t>he Chapters to give pledges
for this purpose. Each Chapter
giving a pledge to receive a number
of volumes commensurate with the
amount of the pledge. Both of
these subjects will be taken up by
our Chapter and fully discussed be
fore our next annual meeting which
will be held in Florence. Mrs.
Woodson announced that, hereafter,
the convention will give a banner to
the Chapter sending in the greatest
amount of historical work and urg
ed the Edgefield Chapter to com
pete for this banner.
.Just before the close of the meet
ing a master of much interest was
brought before us. The need of an
aged veteran who is suffering from
an incurable disease. The Chapter
decided to send him a Christmas
gift of money. Our usual Christ
mas box for the County Home will
be sent, and articles for it will be
sent to Mrs. Marsh on the 20th. v
Mrs. Jones, historian, now took
charge of the meeting. The Chap
ter saug "America" standing and a
paper 00 English Supremacy, pre
pared by Miss Hortense Woodson
was read. Miss Ruth Tompkins
beautifully read the ''American
Flag." Mrs. Jno. Tompkins sang"
as a solo, "Columbia, the Gera of
the Ocean," the Chapter risiog dur
ing its redition.
During the social half hour delic
ious chicken 6andwitches and cof
fee were served.
HOW TO CHECK THAT COLD
"When it is painful to breathe and
fever sends chills up and down
your back, you are in for a cold. A
timely dose of Dr. Bell's Pine Tar
Honey will stop the sneezes and
sniffles. The pine balsam loosens
the phlegm and clears the bronchial
tubes, the honey soothes and re
lieves the sore throat. The anti
septic qualities kill the germ and
the congested condition is relieved.

biunchial effections quickly reliev

Havnet we been having hog kilt

ly was that business going on Tues
day of last we?k, for'tbe^two Bunch

We always enjoy the eating, but
the work is so tiresome and so much
to get through with, especially when
we have no help. , j?
We attended services at Hardy's
Sunday and there were so very few
peeple out. The day was bright
and cold, but it did not bring the
people out. Mr. and Mrs. Tem
Briggs were out in their new Dort,
and were praising it highly. Mr's.
Briggs has says she hamed it ?My
Daughter," and she runs as she
ought to.
Christmas is coining, and it
brings several reunions. Mrs. Brig?n
was telling us that Mr? and .Mrs. V?.
R. Dorn and family, Mr. and Mrs..
Eab Matthews and baby will spend
Christmas with them.
Mr. Walter Bunch will come up
Sunday morning and return Christ
mas night. Master .Edward Bun<:h
goes home for the holidays from
Clemson.
We suppose there will be.a goori
many to come home around here.
The children are looking forward
to the Christmas tree at the Ceme:

may have good weather and enjoy
the tree immensely.

Hartville. ; ^
In the college town of Hartsville,
where the Coker college for women
is located, such an advanced state
of universal sanitation has been es- j
tablished that Hartsville becomes
an inspiration and an example for
every city in the South. The report
of Secretary James A. Haynes, M.
D., of the state board of health of
South Carolina gives high praise to
the college itself, which he found,
"equipped with a modern sanitary!
system of plumbling, th? college
buildings well ventilated, the dor
mitories of sufficient size and every
thing in strictly sanitary condition."
Of Hartsville Dr Haynes says it goe??
farther towards the ideal sanitary
city than any other city in the state
on account of the activities of its
board of health.
Further tribute is contained io a
private letter from Di. Carter,
senior surgeon of the United States
bureau of health, in which he
says:
"I feel as if I really ought to tell
you about Hartsville. It ?H one of
the most progressive places I know,
and the municipal sanitary work is
most efficiently done. I mean all of
the work generally included as san
tary, although much of it is not
strictly so-cleaning stre?ts, .clean
ing our street gutter*, removing
trash from streets and from yards,
no paper in the street, no garbage
left exposed, no spilling of garbage
when it is emptied. The civic spirit
is good, lt is not only the health
officer and tho mayor. ' The whole
town takes a pride in the appear
ance of the town, and not only
make, but keep it, not one of, but
the heatest ae?d cleanest town I have
ever seen anywhere. It looks like
a town the day alter 'clean up day,'
only it looks so all the time." -

Which is the Honest Man?
Suppose two men-for the sake
of convenience we will call them
Mr. A. and Mr. B.-are regular
subscribers for a newspaper and
suppose both of them owe for a
year or more. Now both of these
men decide, upon the ground of
economy or for seine other reason,
to discontinue the paper.
Mr. A. calls at the office or sends
in a money order for the amdunt he
owes and requestes that the paper
be stopped. But Mr. B. instead
of paying what he is honestly due
for the paper, simply orders it stop
ped-gives no reason and pays no
money. Which of the two is the
honest man?
FROM THE BORDER.
.Interesting Letter From El Paso
by Capt. Gaines, an Edge
field Son Who Made
Good.
Editor Edgefield Advertiser:
Probably some of your readerr
might be interested in hearing how
the boys from South Carolina art
faring on the Border.
We haye been in this land of
horned toads, rattlesnakes, abd
Mexicans since Aug. 12, and we are
beginning to feel almost "climatiz
ed" to it by now. It is really a
very tine.country to live in. The
air is so dry that, though it does
turn hot and cold pretty suddenly,
one does not feel it like we at borne
where the air is generally full of
moisture.' The average gain in
weight in my company' since we
have - been in Texas is about 15
pounds. I have gained 19 pounds,
since I came into the Federal Ser
vice'at Styx in July. I suppose
part of it is due to the regular rou
tine aud exercise that we are all
forced to take, for, whereas some
of os wsed to get up at 8 or 9
o'clock in time for breakfast, we
now get up at 5:50 for Reveille
followed by 16 minutes ' Butt's
Manual.
When we arrived in camp last
August, we were assigned toa camp
ing ground right opposite the Penn
sylvania Division north of Fort
Bliss and about 7 miles' north of
El Paso. We have been there ever
since with the exception of the two
weeks we *pent on the "hike", to
Las Cruces, N. M., a few days on
the target range at Dona Ana, N.
M,, and the Border Patrol duty we
are on at present.
We spent so much time drilling
and e'veryone got so tired of it that
we were overjoyed when we learned
i hat we we'<3 to take our turn at
$*?&J ?S?it The ?th er
day the Rio Grande rose HO muco
that it oomplctely surrounded one
of our outguards, and it looked as
if the men were going to have to
wade out through the ice cold wa
ter. One of the boys made the re
mark, though, that bc did not mind
that at all just so there wasn't any
''Squads Right" connected with it.
On December 1 our regiment was j
ordered to Border Patrol. My j
company was ordered to Collings-!
worth, a little place about 5 miles
southeast of El Paso. .We relieved
company C., 3rd. Ohio Infantry.
We found one of the prettiest little
camping places iu Texas-a little
grove of cotton-words about li
mile? from the Rio Grande. My
company bas about 3 miles cf river
front to guard. There are five fords
which ^;an be crossed, and, since
our orders say that no one must
cross in either direction, it tikes a
squad of men constantly on duty at
each ford. Only a few people have
attempted to cross, and they prompt
ly turned back, for they were fired
upon iii each instance by the men
on guard They do not tire to hil
the first time, but thi;y would do so
in case the party crossing continued
to advance.
The officers catch it just as hard
as one else. There are three in the
company and we take it tari about
as officer of the guard. X.he puard
is inspected three times a day, and1
it amounts to a ride of 3D or 35
miles. One inspection must be
made between midnight and day
break', so it does not feel so good to
get up at 3 a. m., to take a ten mile
ride down the Rio Grande.
The Mexicans even on this side of
the river are certainly of a low type.
A family of them will live in a lit
tle mud thatch ed "Pen" not over
10 feet square. They make their
houses by platting switches not over
3-4 of an inch in diameter together,
and then plastering mud over the
outside.. The floors are of dirt, and
every thine: in sight is^fn a very un
sanitary condition. One generally
has to pass by on the windward* side.
We don't know how long we are
to be nere, as Uncle Sara is as si
lent as the "Sphnx" about anything
that even bears on the subject. We
are all willing to stay as long as
WP are required, and there is not
much of the 'I wantta go home''
talk in the South Carolina camp,
but every now and then we catch
ourselves thinking how nice it
would be to be somewhere else thau
here for Christmas,

Aged Lady Passes Away.
A long liff fall of good deeds
and hejoic sacrifices was brought to
a peaceful close when Mrs. -iv.nily
Middleton died Wednesday, Decem
ber 13, at the home of her daugh
ter, Mrs. C. F. Kohlruss, in Augus
ta.- While her strength was stead
ily tailing under the weight of years,
yet her last illness wa& hot of long
duration. Mrs. Middleton was sud
denly stricken with apoplexy,/and
died in a short time. Her other
daughter, Mrs. A. A. Edmunds,
was also"with her and ministered ta
her wants very tenderly in her last
hours.
The life of this gentle woman
was one that has but few paralles.
Not many yeavs after her marriage,
her husband, the lamented^Williara
Middleton, was taken. He died in
18fi2 while on a furlough, being at
the time a member of the Confeder
ate army. lilr. Middleton prior to
this, while a mere boy, rendered
gallant service in the Mexican war.
Because of the distinguished service
of her husband, Mrs. Middleton re
ceived a pension from the national
government until her death. At
the age of 26, she was left a widow
with five daughters of tender years.
Notwithstanding the distressing
times which followed in the wake
of the Civil War, she held her prop
erty together with' marked ability
and reared this large family. Be
fore her marriage to Mr. Middleton
she was Miss Emily Prescott, being
the last member of the older gener
ation of this honored family. This
noble woman was sweet spirited and
lovable in disposition, scattering
sunshine and joy whithersoever she
went. She made friends of all with
whem she came in contact. Her
long useful life and the influence
that lives after her are a priceless
heritage to loved ones who feel so
keenly this severance of earthly
ties. ...
Of her five daughters opiy two
s arv/Lvc ?h?^-??^
Aucasta arid ??rs. A. ?t.. Edmunds
of Edgefield. She has seventeen
grand-children and twenty-two
great-grand children.
The funeral was conducted Thurs
day at Republican church, of which
j she was a member, and her body
j was laid to rest between the graves
i of her husband and father.
Auction Sale First Monday.
As annouuced in his half-paire
advertisement this week, Mr. J.
Perry Waddell will hold another
auction sale of horses, mares and
mules at Edgefield on the first Mon
day in January. Mr. Waddell has
already held t'*o auction sales io
Edgefield and one at Johnston.
Since be came among our people be
has made friends, both personal
friends and business friends. He
is located in Greenville and con
ducts a large stock business
there. Having made large pur
chases of stock, shipping them in
car lots to different towns, he is in
a position to sell at a small margin
of profit. He has sold some good
stock around Edgefield and we feel
confident that the auction sale ou
the first Monday in January will be
largely attended. Mr. Waddell
stands squarely behind every state
ment be makes about the stock he
sells. If you are in need of a horse,
mare or mule attend the sale on the
first Monday in January.
Ghristmas on the Gang. -
Supervisor Edmunds has provi
ded for Christmas for at least one
individual. Monday afternoon he
carried Ed El am, better known
around town as "Sugar Lee," out
to the chaingang to spend Christ
mas. "Sugar Lee" took on too
much "tea" the other night and
undertook to run the town. As a re
sult soon found himself behind the
bars. Instead of running with his
gang in town "durin' of the Christ
mas" he will run with another
gang.
Leave It Off.
Among the things that you for
get in your Christmas shopping, by
all means forget to buy a toy or
paper-cap pistol for your little boy.
In the first place, the littl** feilow is
liable to be injured by it and in the
second place it creates a desire to
use firearms which, unfortuuateb.
he will learn early enough in l^fe <
without your direct assistance and
encouragement.
