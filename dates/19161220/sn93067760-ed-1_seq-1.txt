It also lr being observed in olicial
cireles that the note was uniformly
plresenited without comment. This is
taken to indicate that Germany fram
ed the communincation so that the
neutral intermediaries would act only
as forwarding agents, at least at. the
outset.

expected to show tl~e general attitude
of the British government. , 'here
