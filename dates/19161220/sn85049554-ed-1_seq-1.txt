7 TRADE IN DOUBT
Plan Seen to Turn Over War JVad* to
Ship* Carrying Goods For War
Service—United 3tat*s H*lpl**s to
Prevent Withdrawal of Britiah Ship*
From American Trade and Harbor*
—Might Relieve Submarine Question.
Washington, Dec. 20. Nationaliza
tion of British shipping, mentioned
briefly- by Premier Lloyd-George ad
one of the first acts of (the new war
ininistery, commands more interest
here from the strictly American point
of view than any other pnaae of the
premier's speech. What effect it
would have on American foreign trade
and on the status of British ships sunk
by German submarines has cau^d
much concern among officials.
The taking into the national service
of the whole mercantile marine, follow
ing closely on England's announcement
that she could not, guarantee coal at
any of her coaling Bases the world over
except to ships serving allied interests,
is thought by officials at first glance to
turn over the war trade to ships carry
ing goods for war service.
r*
United States H*lpl*M?
There is in law iioimii* the United
States can do should the whole British
merchant marine be withdrawn from
American trade and harbors.
It is thought the effect on the sub
marine situation would be to. remove
confusion between public vessels not
entitled to any protection and private
vessels entitled to warning. Just where
the point of distinction would lie is a
complex question.
The premier's announcement^6£ the
recognition of the .agents of venizelos
raises the question of what should be
the attitude of this government if Veij.
-ezilos should become de fa£to ruler of
an appreciable part of Greece. The
state department has farced a similar
situation in Egypt, and has been un
able to credit a consul general to Cairo.
Generally the department has not rec
ognized changes during the war,"pre

Heavier taxes are planned on m'nes,

MOVING RAILROAD LINES.
Canada T**ring Up 1,000 Mile* of Raod
For Use on Western War Front.
Ottawa, Ont., Dec. 20.—Canada has
begun to tear up 1,000 miles or railway
to meet the needs of the war on the
western front in France and Belgium,
It was learned last night, The rail#
will be shipped to France, where they
will be relaid to facilitate the move
ments of troops, guns, munitions "and
supplies from French ports to the
fighting lines.
Laborers now are at work tearing
up 300 miles of government railway
Sidings, and it has been decided to re*
move 220. miles of rails between Ed
monston and the Pacific coast, where
the Canadian Northern and Grand
Trunk Pacific runs parallel. Traffic
-will be thrown upon one of these lines.
It is expected that some of the rails
to bs sent to France will b* obtained
from the Trans-Continental railway
and the Hudson Bay railway. It is
stated that twenty miles of rails Will
load one steamer. One cargo already
is on the way to the seaboard, It is
said.
In sending a call to Canada last week
for rails, it was said, British govern
ment authorities represented that,
prompt action would save thousands of
lives. It was impossible to obtain new
rails, owing to the great demand for
steel to manufacture shells. An of
ficial was sent to New York, where he
conferred with Frank Cochrane, ^Can
adian minister of railways, who direct
ed F, P. Gutellus, manager of the gov
ernment railways, to all possible
Mr. Gutellus thereupon set $00 men at
work tearing up ^00 miles of sidings.
E. J. Chamberlain, president of the
Grand Trunk Pacific railway, was re
called from Washington tojfew York,
It was said, and the decision to take up
200 miles of rail in western Canada
was reached at a-conference !wlth.A. H.
Smith, prwldhnt of the New York
Central "and president of a board of
Investigation of Canadian railways.
Soldiers will be employed to tear up
the rails when laborers cannot be em
ployed, it waa stat,ed.

BOSTON RETAINS 8ALOONS.
Remain* W&w, With Big^br Majority
0«*im* filly Sunday.
Boston, D«c. i'SO.—Billy Sunday's
campaign f^r 'a? "boozoless" Boston
failed. The greatest effort ever made
to have theiraile of liquor made illegal
for a year aftir May 1 next under the
annual local option referendum result
ed in an increased majority for license,
the largest for six years.
The-Tote complete stood: Yeas, 63,
469 nays, 29,997, a majority for license
of 23,462. Lost year the license ma
jority was 14,328, due to revenge taken
by Boston Democrats for the defeat of
Governor Walsh by' liquor Interests.
Not since 1892 had Boston be6n in
danger of being dry. It has not been' a
saloSnless town for forty-one years.
There is reasonable ground for the
deduction that Sunday's campaign in
creased the license vote by causing
people who otherwise would have voted
"no," as a demand for stricter regula
tion or for local option by wards, to
vote "yes' 'in Jjpar Of a dry city that
would alienate
{business from Boston.

Geoige's reply to Germany's peace pro

in the British press, and the general
comment is that if Germany wants
peace, she will state terms which will
torm a bai'is for (liacuasion. The Man

The iiriti=n guVcrninent naa much ti
reilect on this mornnig. The jepiy o£
Lloyd-George
to peace proposal iad
been anticipated and passages of his
speecn appeared in late papers yester
uay. The domestic program of the new
government, nowevei, was not pub
lished until thiu morning and it waa too
vast aod too brielly indicated for th«
immediate crystallization of opinion.
The most important of these points
foreshadowed by the premier was the
general mobilization of labor Jtoi1 the
war and the vital industries. Mr.
Lloyd-George indicated he meant to
begin with a vo.umary p»an and thai
if this failed he would ask parliament
to give. the government compuisory
powers to place all the labor of the
Btate at his services. Hiy proposal

Amstecdam. via London, Dec. 20.—
Commening. on Premier Lloyd-George'3
speech the Tageliche Rundscnau oi
Berlin saya:
"Reparation could be demanded by
England on»y if Germany had declared
war on England, if we were to biame
for the war, if we had committed
crimes against international law, and
if we had been defeated."
The Lokal Anzeiger says:
"If Lloyd-George means to postpone
satisfying Europe's desire for peace
until the time when the entente is suc
cessful in conquering Germany's
army and those of her allies, then the
whole of Europe as weil as Lloyd
George knows full well- that this an
nouncement means eternal war, unleB*
it is in the power of the German com
mand to bring It to an earlier tei mi
nation than Lloyd-George supposes."
ASQUITH GIVES APPROVAL.
Will Support Lloyd*George—Say* No
Patched-Up Compromise Will Satiafy.
London, Dec. 20.—The former pre
mier, iH. -H. Asquith, in the housu of
commons, after declaring that his flrot
duty was to extend congratulations,
which he did with all his heart, to Mr.
Lloyd-George upon his accession to the
highest and most important office In
the service of the crown, made a brief
but pointed reference to the question of
pc&cc.
"The.country," he said, "has just re
ceived some so-called pe.ace prop'sals
from Cermany. True, these proposals
are wrapped up with the familiar dia
lect of Prussian arrogance. But how
comes it after "two years of war that a
power wliicli pFOfwsaea itself conscious
of military superiority and ultimate
victory begins to whisper—nay, even to
shout victory so that all "the world can
hear—the word 'peace.'
"Is this from a sudden access of
chivalry? When did the German chan
cellor become so sensitive to the dic
tates of humanity?
All For Honorabl* Poaoe.
"We must look elsewhere for the or
igin of these proposals. They are born
of military arid economic necessity. We
all yearn for peace, but it must be an
honorable, not a shamefaced peace.
There must'He jio patched up. precari
ous compromise. It miwt be a peace
that achieves-the purpose, for wHich we
entered the" war. Such a peace w*
would gladly ^accept. 'Anything short
of it we are bbflnd to repudiate by ev
ery obligation of honor, and above all
by the debt we owe those who have
given their lives to the cause.
"1 see nothing In the note from Ger
many which gives me the least reason
to believe that they are prepared to
give us reparation and security. If
they are In ^uch a mood—If they are
prepared to give \is reparation for the
past and security for the future—let
them say so." v*

'Mr, Asquith, in congratulating Mr.
Lloyd^-George, said that if he spoke
from where he.did it was not because
he claimed to be the leader of the on
