Little Justifiable Cause for Protest

Probing the

[By Webb Miller, United Press Staff

EL PASO, Texas, Dec. 20.—Action
upon the cases of 580 Ohio national
guardsmen for breach of military reg
ulations in signing and maliing a
"round robin" to an Ohio newspaper
protesting against a longer stay on
the border find against camp condi

port of the district inspectors investi
gating the affair by order of General
Oeo. Bell, Jr., commander of the
eleventh army division here.
Major H. E. Ely of General Bell's
staff went Into the Ohio camp again
today to continue his investigation
and ascertain If there was any basis
for complaints. During the day it Is
expected the investigation will be fin

to General Bell.
After inspecting the quality, amount
and preparation of the guardsmen's
rations, and the camp conditions.
Major Ely went into the tents and
talked with the men who signed the
protest. The names of all signers
are known, as the "round robin"
came into possession of the military
authorities when It was intercepted in
the malls and returned to the sender.
In most cases the guardsmen freely
admitted signing the protest and gave
their reason.
As the investigation proceeded It
was found that the protest was mainly
a manifestation of desire of the men to
return home. Although the results
of the inquiry have not yet been mf"1"
public it is known that little Justici

covered. Many of the men declared
they had signed the "round robin"
merely because they wanted to go
home and thought the protest would
have that effect. Others signed be

Despite the kaiser's order of the day

NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY
Berlin Expects Its Own Announce­

[By Carl W. Ackerman, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
BERLIN, Iec. 20.—Germany re
gards speeches of statesmen in Eng
land, France and Russia as a bluff to
Impress Berlin with the entente's de
termination. The entente govern
ments cannot do otherwise—in view
of their past statements—although
they are really anxious now for peace
This was the view reflected In all
walks of life today following Premier
Lloyd-George's answer to the imperial
German chancellor in his speech of
yesterday.
Berlin is not pessimistic, despite the
London statement, added to the pre
vious pronounclamentos from Petro
grad and Paris that the allies are de
termined to continue the war until
their high objects are attained.
The general view was that these
speeches are not to be taken seriously
when weighed against Germany's pro
gress In Rumania.
No only was thlB.the public view,
but officials coincided. One such offi
cial declared that no belligerent would
ever ask a neutral nation to begin ne
gotiations—nevertheless steps by a
neutral now would not be regarded
as unfriendly to the central powere.
He added, however, that the public
state of mind is not such now that
American interference would be wel
comed.

phrase 'reparation' is completely
valueless," the newspaper added.
