London. Deo. 10. The allies have
not slammed the door oa peace; they
have simply said to Germany: "Here
are our terms; take them- or lea re
them; It Is your move but dont
come again In the rote of a victor."
Thla waa the universal British
lew today, when the public had an
opportunity to digest the full mean

terday the public Interpretation
waa that Lloyd-George had furnished
Chancellor von Bethmanu-Hollweg aa
opportunity to demonstrate alncer-

they argued, she now know how to
go about It. ,
Incidentally. It waa remarked here

Lloyd-George had destroyed Ger
many' belief that England Ja domin

had staled at the ouaet that Russia
and France, acting independently and
separately, had reached the conclu

Lloyd-George's plan for universal
national service and civilian mobili
sation, moulding the nation into an
army behind the army, was popular
ly accepted today aa though It were
the simplest routine of peace times.
Not a complain, not the slightest
thought of opposition waa manifest
ed. The press, and the man in the
street, reflected the universal senti

George; what doea lie want u to
do?"
Impending nationalisation of hip
ping and mine haa been anticipated
for some time, and the Welsh mln
era alone had objected to nationali

the shipping by the government ha
likewise been expected aa commerce
haa long been the target of measure

8tatee, in common with other neu
trals, will be interested In any world
peace, guarantee or disarmament dis
cussion, which may follow the pres

officially stated today.
United fltatea officials have talked
Informally of a world guarantee as
essential to any final terms. Whether
the "Interest" officially revealed to
day by the state department, would
be other than passive, was not stated.
It Is assumed, however, that -this
government would take aa active
hand is furthering such ideas, if they
found them to fee welcome by the
belligerents.
The president feels that when the
time comes for this government to
make any move in the peace situa
tion, it will be made dear that the
United States is not Interested In the
cause of the present European out
break, but only in assurances of per
manent peace.
The means of establishing this, the
president believes, are vital to this
nation, because in every way. she
has. "whether She willed U or not,"

national defense will be evolved, con
tinued their work of testimony taking

affairs committees heard from high
'army and war department officials
and civilians, the house naval com
mittee heard more expert advice re
garding the alleged defenselessneas
of the United States, because of In
sufficient sea-forces.
Representative Edwin Y. . Webb,
North Carolina, author of the nation
wide dry bill, told the United Press
today he wilt urge immediate passage
of hi measure on the ground that
no nation can really be prepared
against possible attack by a foreign
foe, until the sale of all Intoxicating
liquors Is stopped.
Webb said he will Insist that
crushing out of the saloon and the
liquor traffic 1 so bound up with real
preparedness, that It can not be push
ed aside.
"Any kind of military prepared
ness Is necessarily bound up with the
physical Tltnees of the Individual."
said Webb. "The warriors of Europe
have ruled that they cannot be sucA
ceseful under the old conditions. That
Is obviously why France, then Rus
sia and then England declared
against the liquor either tn absolute
prohibition or the most rigid regula
tion." Navy department bureau chiefs
appeared before the house naval com
mittee today. Increase In the cost
of battleship 'building during the
