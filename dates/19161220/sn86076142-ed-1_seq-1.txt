WASHINGTON, Dec. 20. The first
official impression of Lloyd George's
reply to the German peace proposals,
with the announcement of Russia,
Italy and France, is that it does not
foreqlose further moves which. might
lead to a discussion of peace, such
as the central powers have discussed.
"This view is held by officials of
the administration and of the Ger
man embassy. Official Washington
is practically unanimous, however, in
the opinion that the British premier's
speech has shown that any positive
action, by the United States toward
mediation not only would be prema
ture, but might embarrass such. ac
tion later.
It was stated authoritatively that
for the present the United States
would art only as an Intermediary
transmitting communications between
the belligerents. ,
The German embassy interprets
the British premier's speech as open
ing the door to a further discussion,
although the German diplomats Inti
mately familiar with the aims and
views of the central powers made
no attempt to conceal their uncer
tainty regarding the outcome of such
negotiations. They feel, however,
that if the note replying to the Ger
man communication follows the tenor
of the premier's speech, the entente
from the Teutonic viewpoint has
done all expected of it and has
brought the idea of a , peace con
ference one step nearer realization.

the matter. To me it looks as though
there will be at least one more ex
change of notes, which will talk ot
the future and not of the pest."
The allies' responses are viewed by
administration officials not at a flat
refusal, but an answer most to be
expected by a group of belligerents,
anxious to throw back on their ad
versaries in a world diplomatic strug
gle for public opinion, all the onus
of having caused the war and ot
having brought about conditions un
der which peace was morally wrong.
Nevertheless, with this predicted dip
lomatic move out of the way, officials
foresee the opportunity, almost the
Invitation, for Germany to make an
other cautious advance, which finally
may bring out the minimum bases of
contention.
German embassy officials were op
timistic because the British premier
did not flatly refuse to enter Into a
discussion. At the same time they
deprecated the suggestion that defi
nite peace terms might be set forth
in formal notes. The German view,
as reflected here, la that nothing can
be achieved by a public discussion of
terms, for the reason that each set of
belligerents la bound to ask more
than It actually expects to receive,
because there are so many belliger
ents each striving to gain realization

FE
(By Associated Preaa.)
PARIS, Dec. 20. Henry Berenger,
senator for Guadeloupe, In the senate
accused the cabinet of weakness and
dilatoriness. - The senator said- the
new ministry had brought about only
a change In personnel. This was
shown in the way in which the war
was being directed, the French hav
ing been unable to drive the Germans
beyond the frontier. The speaker
then reproached the ministry wtth
defects in the organization of eco
nomic life and charged that there
had been a lack of organization in
the production of war material. He
then attacked French diplomacy, to
which he imputed as a result the
recent events In Athens.
"Do not think that your past war
record," said M. Berenger, addressing
Premier Briand, "gives us. sufficient!;
assurance for the future."
M. Briand In replying deprecated
reproaches against the government
at this grave period "because the
men in power must be able to work
with the necessary freedom of mind,
have uninterrupted confidence at
home and for their actions abroad,
and our allies must not be allowed
to think that our government Is
under suspicion and the menace of
interpellation.''
"I am ready,1 M. Briand continued
"to make way at any time (or he
who may be judged more worthy
than. I. But L ask you with, the
system employed up to this time
what government could resist. As
for me, I have gone more than 44
times before the committees (each
committee composed of 44 members)
and lately was detained ten entire
day in secret sessions of the cham
ber. I ask you, under these, condi
tions, how a president ot the cabinet
can be a 'war president,' a president
of energetic action, when you know
the facta of the terrible task to which
I am bound, then you will Judge me
and condemn me if you btlnk fit."
M. Briand alluded to the latest
French victory at Verdun, which
iroked much applause. Referring to
me general military situation, tne
premier continued:
' "If we have - not ; broken through,
neither have the Germans broken
through after 40 years of preparation,
even though it might have been
thought they would triumph after
having violated Belgium. Fortunately
French soldiers, nearly alone at that
time,, blocked the way and said:
'No thoroughfare.'"
historical precedent shows conclu
sively that without direct negotia
tions and exchange ot views by rep
resentatives in a conference the
breach between enemies la not likely
to narrow. ' .

may, should Great Britain ask It, he

statement Sft, principle regarding
terms, especially it failure to take
such action should he the only bar

representatives to a conference). On
the other hand, great emphasla la
placed upon the statement that If
the entente should refuse a confer
ence, Germany and her allies would
regard It as a refusal to talk of
peace.
Germany, it la said here, will an
swer any note Great Britain and her
allies send, providing, ot course, the
communication doea not. flatly reject
the Teutonic proposal to enter Into
negotiations. No secret was , made
ot the fact that Germany will use
every means known to diplomacy In
