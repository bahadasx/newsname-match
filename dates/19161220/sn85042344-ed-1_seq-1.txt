I ta it'll l.loyd t.rorge. Ihe new Brit
ish prime minister, has s(, tohl the
house of luminous while hi Ihe house
of lords his wortls were re-eelioel by
Dnrl Curon of Keillestou. ineiiibc. of
the prime, minister's war council.
Almost simultaneously with the an
iiouiiecment In the British parliament
the French i IiiiiiiImi' of di-pulle was
told by Premier Hriaml that the cn
leole allies would send a concerted
reply to the Teutonic allies that It was
"impossible I,, take their reum'st for
pca-c seriously," while the Russian
council of the empire adopted uu order
of the day iiiuiiilmoiisly refusing lo
cnicr under present conditions into
liny peace negotiation with (iciiiiuiij.
HisliiH 111 tlio lioubo of commons a
few minutes utter 4 o'clock the prime
minister said;
"I immuf heforn tha house of coin-
nwinu tnihlv v ith the most terrible
...... ii.nltu ,n,. f!tn full iinon the
hI i uldcrs of any living man us chief
adviser or the eiown, in ine mum
gigantic war in which tbiH country was
ever engaged, u war upon which the
evoits qf Ith destiny depends. It la
the greatest war ever waged; the
burdens lire the heaviest that have
been cast upon this or any other coun.
try and the issues the gravest thai
bine been attached to uny conflict in
which hiiinuiiily was ever Involved.
'The responsibilities of the new
government have been suddenly ac
centuated by the declaration made by
theMicrinun chancellor. The state
ment made by him in the reiciislag
has been followed by a note presented
by the Cnited States without note or
common!. The answer given by this
government will be Riven In full ac
cord with all our allies.
"Naturally there lias been an In
terchange of views, not upon the note,
bemuse il is only recently arrived, nut
upon the speech which impelled it and
as the note itself is practreiil'.y only a
reproduction or a paraphrase or the
FDct-h. the sill ject nint'er of the note
itself has been discussed informally
bet w cen the allies. 1 am glad to be
able to slate that wa each separately
and Independently arrived at identical
conclusions.
I "raises l'raniv anil Kussiu.
"I am very glad that the first
nmwer Riven to the statement of the
Herman chancellor whs Riven by
France and Kusslu. They have the
iiniiueKtionable rlRbt to Rive the fi'st
answer to such an Institution. Ihej
eneiuv is still on their soil and their
naerifues have been the Rieater.
"Tlio answer they h.ive Riven has
already appeared In the papers, mid 1
simply stand here to Rive clear and
definite support to the statement tnc
hae already made.
"Any man or set of men who wan
tonly or without sufficient cause pro
long a terrible war like this would
have on his siTTll a crime that oceans
could not cleanse.
"On the other hand. It is equally
true that any man or set of men who
from a sense of weariness or despair
abandoned the slniRRle without
nchievliiR the hich purpose for
which we entered it. would be guilty
of the costliest act of poltroonery ever
perpetrated bv any statesman. I
should like lo quote the words of
Abraham Lincoln under similar con
ditions: 'We accepted this war for
nil object and a world object and the
war will end wnen ure oojci-i m n
tained under Ood. I hope It will never
end until that time.'
Are X'i Proposals.
"Are we likely to achieve the ob
ject hv acceptinR the invitation, of the
Herman chancellor? What are Jho
proposals? There ore none.
"To enter on the Invitation of Oer
manv proclaiming herself victorious
without any knowledge of what pro
posals she proposes to make, into a
conference is to put our beads Into a
noose with the rope end In the hands
of (iermany. , ,
(This country Is not altogether with
out experience In these matters. This
is not the first time we have fought a
great military nepotism overshudow
and it won't be the first
time we have helped to overthrow a
military depotism. We have uncom
fortable historical memories of these
things and can recall one of the great
est of these despots, whose favorite
dVvlee was to appear in the garb of
nn niiRcl of peace either when he
wished time to nsslmibite his- con
quests or to reorganize hi forces for
fresh conquests, or secondly, when his
subjects showed symptoms of fatiRiie
and war weariness, an appeal was al--,
ways made In the name of humanity,
lie demanded an end to the blood
shed at which he professed himself
horrified, altho he himself was mainly
responsible.
KiirM mi's Kspcrlcmv.
i'Our ancestors were taken In once
and bitterly they and F.urope rued it.
The time was spent In reorganizing his
forces for a deadlier attuck on the
us to regard this not Willi a consld
eruhle measure of reminiscent dis
quietude. "We I eel that we ought to know
before we run give favorable consid
eration to such an Invitation that
lleiuiany Is prepared to accede to Ihe
only terms on which It is possible
peace can he obtained and main
tained in Kiirope. Those terms have
been leueiiteiilv stated by all the lend
ing statesmen of the Hllles. They
have been stated repeatedly nere nun
outside. To quote the leader of the
house las! week:
" 'Itepuratlou ami guarantee against

tuke mi, I It is Important that there
should be no mistake In a matter of
deuth to millions.
The Terms for I'eace.
"Let me repeat complete restitu
tion, full reparation and effectual
guarantee.
"Ild the (lerinan chancellor use a
single phrase to Indicate that he was
prepared to accept such a peace? Was
there hint of restitution? Was there,
a suggestion of reparation? Was there
un implication of any security for the
future that this outrage oil civiliza
tion would not again be perpetrated
n'. the first profitable opportunity?
"The vet v substance and stylo of

that Germany bus committed any
