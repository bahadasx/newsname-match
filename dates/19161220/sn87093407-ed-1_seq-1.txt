The general view was that thes*

Not only was this the public view,
but officla's coincided. One such
official declared that no belligerent

YOU, average citizens, who don't take any steady interest in
politics. All the professional politicians were, of course,
against it.
We called up Nonpartisan headquarters — and would
you believe it?
That politician had the "dope" on you, we fear.
The nonpartisan bill needs 40,000 signatures. Thus far,
there are only 20,000 filed at the headquarters, 3107 Arcade

And the time limit is up Saturday night! Time nearly
up, and 20,000 signatures more needed!
Great Heavens! Can't you hear the chortles of glee

nonpartisanship has failed?
Can't you see the smirk of satisfaction on the face of
every "handpicker," ward heeler, boodler, and hanger-on

Doesn't that make you mad enough to take out a petition
and get it signed up- and then take out another, and an
other, until when Saturday night comes, the required num

Come, now, let us "boobs" and "mutts" pull together!
Seattle must furnish 10,000 of the 20,000 signatures needed,
or nonpartisanship fails.
Let us fool the professional politicians this time.
NONPARTISANSHIP MUST NOT DIE.

PLAN FOR PUSHING THE WAR
Halted Press H'aff C"rr»s»ondent
LONDON. Dec. 20.—The al
lies have not slammed the door
on peace; they have aimply
said to Germany: "Here are
our terms; take them or leave
them. It is your move—but
don't come again In the role of
a victor."
This was the universal view to
day, when the public had an oppor
tunity to digest the full meaning of
Lloyd-George's speech The public
Interpretation was that Lloyd George
had furnished Von Bethmann-lloll
weg an opportunity to demonstrate
sincerity.
If Germany really desires peace,
they argued, she now knows how to
go about It.
Incidentally It was remarked
here today how adroitly and strik

Germany's Illusion t hat England
Is dominating the policies of the

recalled, had stated at the outset
that Russia and Prance, acting In
