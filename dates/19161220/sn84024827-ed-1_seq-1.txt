FOR UNIVERSAL SERVICE

i (By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19The agi
tation for some form of compulsory
military service in the United
States received qualified support
from Secretary Baker today before
, the House military committee, en
couraging opponents of the present
volunteer system to predict that
legislation for a change might be
framed which would be sanctioned
by Mr. Baker and possibly by
President Wilson himself. The
President has said he would not
attempt to reach a decision on
the subject until a definite plan
was placed before him.
Replying to a direct question as to
his views on compulsory military serv-
ice
, Secretary Baker said:
Would Draw for 'Em.
The obligation to serve the coun
ts universal one. The question
try
of how to bring about preparation for
national defenses is one 'or poncy rain
er than theory. Whether universal
military service or a selective con
norintion is the correct answer, I do
not know. The theory of a iDmmon
interest in a common country would
be satisfied by a method of selecting
soldiers that was not voluntary in
character."
"Give Guards a Chance."
The secretary told the committee,
however, that since Congress had re
jected the continental army plan in
favor of the national guard system, he
believed the guard should be given a
fair trial. He inclined to the view
that regiments returning from the
border would be held together by the
experience through which they had
passed and that officers and men of
the right sort would be inspired by the
knowledge that they had gained to
work for greater efficiency. He did
not amply his suggestion in regard to
selective conscription.
inventory All Men.
It is understood the plan under con
sideration contemplates the making of
an inventory of men in the country, as
is being done with industrial resources,
and devising a means whereby every
citizen would be liable in a war emerg
ency for the character of the work l'Jr
which he is best fitted, by his peace
time training.
In the near future Mr. Baker will ap
pear before the Senate committee
which is having the opinions of army
officials and others on the Chamber

Facts About Guards!
Major General Hugh L. Scott, chief
of stair, was again before the sub-committee
today, urging universal service
and submitting the report Jn the mobil
ization of the national guard for bor
der duty, compiled by Colonel V. C.
Brown from all information available
et the war department.
Facts Versus Fancy.
The conclusion of the general staff.
General Scott said, that no adequate
defense could be built under the pres

Colonel Brown, who commanded the

the most severe punishment to the

mittee himself and told of the hard

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dc. 19. The first
official impression of Lloyd-George's
reply to the German peace proposals,
with the announcement of Russia.
Italy and France, is that it does not
foreclose further moves which might
lead to a discussion of peace such as
the central powers have suggested.
This view is held by officials of the
administration and of the German em
bassy. Official Washington is practi
cally unanimous in the opinion that
the speech has shown that any posl:
tive action by the United States to
ward mediation not only would be pre
mature but might embarrass such act
ion later.
Can Parley Now
It was stated authoritatively tonight
that for the present the United States
would act only as an intermediary
transmitting communications between
the belligerents. The German embas
sy interprets the British premier's
speech as opening the door to a fur
ther discussion, although the German
diplomats intimately familiar with the
aims and views of the central powers,
made no attempt to conceal their un
certainty regarding the outcome of
such negotiations.
Brings Peace Nearer
They feel, however, that if the note
replying to the German communica
tion follows the tenor of the premier's
speech, the entente from the Teuton
ic viewpoint, has done all expected of
it and has brought the idea of a peace
conference one step nearer realiza
tion. To Exchange Notes?
"It appears from the British prem
ier's speech," said Count von Bern
storff, in an authorized statement.
"that the answer of Great Britain will '
not end the matter. To me it looks
as though there would be at least one
more exchange of notes, which will
talk of the future and not of the past."
Invites Discussion
The allies' responses are viewed hv
administration officials not as a flat
refusal but as the answer most to be
expected from a group of belligerents
Nevertheless, with this predicted dip
lomatic move out of the way, officials
foresee the opportunity, almost the
invitation for Germany to make anoth
er cautious advance, which finally
may bring out the minimum basis of
contention.

LOYD-GEORGE'S DISCUSSION
GERMANY CAN SEND ANOTHER NOTE:
ALLIES If IT ASSURANCES FOR FUTURE
Without Reparation, Says Premier, Peace
Now Would Be "Like Putting Our Heads In
Noose WithRopeln the Hands of Germany"
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, Dec. 19. The announcement today by David Lloyd-George, the new
prime minister, that the first act of his administration was the rejection of the proposal of
the central powers for a peace conference constituted one of the most momentous scenes
which the oldest parliamentary veterans had ever witnessed.
Asks Guarantees.
The new premier declared that before the allies could give favorable consideration to
such an- invitation, they must know that Germany was prepared to accede to the allies
terms, giving "complete restitution, full reparation and effectual guarantees," and that
"to enter a conference upon the invitation of Germany, proclaiming herself victorious,
would be putting our heads into a noose with the rope in Germany's hands."
Is Crime Right? He Asks.
Mr. Lloyd-George asserted that at the moment Germany was penning the note, assur
ing her convictions as to the rights of other nations, she was dragging Belgians into slav
ery. He announced that the note contained no proposals of terms, but was a paraphrase
of Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg's speech, and that the allies had separately con
cluded to reject it, although they had informally exchanged views and would within a few
days present a joint reply.
