London, Dec. 20. The allies have not slammed the door
on peace; they have simply said to Germany: "Here are
our terms; take them or leave them.. It is your move
bat don't come again in the role of a victor."
This was the universal British view today, when the

Warned by Police Matron.
Miss White and Mrs. Shank had talks
two years ago when Mrs. Shank first
went on duty as police matron and then
she was wurned to be careful ami not
do any "shines" about Salem. Miss
White left Salem n short time then and
went to Hopewell where her grandpa
rents live. Later she returned to Sa
lem and Mrs. Shank again warned her
to be careful. She then went to live in
Portland with her mother, who is now
the w"ifo of Tom Edwards, who runs the
Electric Restaurant on High street, this
city. She was in the habit of coming
to Salem frequently and always appear
ed to have money. She is known to
bavo registered at the Bligh hotel un
der her own name ami under an assuni 1
ed name. These trips to Salem were
only for n night except once in a while
she would remain two nights. That she
was well supplied with money is indicat
ed by the fact that she took room 2:i(l
at the Marion hotel, which faces on
Ferry street and is one of the best in
the hostelry.
While in Salem Mrs. Edwards, mother
of Myrtle, lived in one of the Olinger
houses on Mill street in the 900 block.
At that time a neighbor who took a lik

some motherly advice about the way
she should conduct herself. The girl's

By Robert J. Bendor.
(United Ptesi stuff correspondent.)
Washington, Dm. 20. The 1'nited
States, in common with other neutrals
will be interested in any world peace
guaranteed or disarmament discussion
which may follow the present peace
proposals situation, it was officially
stated today.
United States officials have Informal
ly talked of u world guarantee as es
sential to any final peace terms. Wheth
er the "interest" officially revealed
today by the state department, would
be other than passive wns not stated.
It is assumed, as previously pointed
out in United I'ress dispatches, that
.this government would take an active
hand in furthering such ideas, if they
found them to be welcome by the bel
ligerents.
The president feels that when the
time comes for this government to make
any move in the peace situation if will
be made clear that the l.'nited States
is not Interested in the chute of the
lOuropean outbreak, but only in assur
ances of permanent peace.
The means of establishing this, the
president believes are vital to this na

DEMANDS RETURN OF

Warns Americans He Will
Give All Aid Possible to

By Webb Miller.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
El Paso, Texas, Dee. 20. With the
declaration that he wliubl give every
assistance to the escape of deserters
from the American army reaching -Mex-
jican soil, General Francisco Gonzales,
coinmaniier ot tlie ( arrauzista garrison
at Juarez, last night in an angrily Ayord
ed written statement bitterly anshiled
Genera Bell, American commander for
his refusal to turn over Colonel Lois
Coiaaduran, wdio escaped from Juarez
into United Slates territory.
General Bell declared he had no au
thority to take Conindurun into custody
as it was either a political or a civil
matter and out of his jurisdiction.
Genanles told representatives of Gen
eral Bell that he wanted the refugee so
he could hang him as he "didn't want
to waste ammunition on him."
The statement was issued by the Ju
arez Commander after several demands
upon the American military authorities
to assist in returning Comaduran across
the river.
Comaduran with a few officers reach
ed Juarez about two weeks ago. Gn the
American side of the bonier, the report
was given out that he was sent by Gen
eral Murguia to repYaca General Gon
zm'ch at Juarez, Two days ago he fled
to this side, declaring that General Gon
zales resisted w hen Comaduran attempt
ed to take command of the sarriiin and
was about to arrest Comaduran when
the latter escaped.
Gonzales declares Comadrun wns sum
moned to Chihuahua City but refused to
go anil fled to Ihc American side, tak
ing government funds. He denies Com
Bduran was to replaeo him. Repeated
demands were made upon General Hell
to arrest the colonel, but all wore re
