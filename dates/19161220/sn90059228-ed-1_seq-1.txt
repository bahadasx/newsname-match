High School Program Postponed.
Due to the unusual rush of work
immediately before the Christmas
season, it has been decided to post
pone the high school program until
after the holidays.
We believe this will give better
satisfaction to both pupils and par
ents.
The Juniors held their first class
party last Saturday night in the new
gymnasium^ Everybody reported
having had an enjoyable time.
The following teachers and high
school students attended the grand
opera at Grand Forks last week:
Miss Cummings, Mr Selleck, Gladys
Grindeland, Eda Swanson Mildred
Wood, Robert Lundgren and Henry
Halvorson.
The high school orchestra, organ
ized under the supervision of Mr.
Selleck, began practicing Monday
afternoon. The following have join
ed the organization: Mildred Wood,
piano Adolph Bakke, Henry Halvor
son, violin Willis Powell, clarinet
Robert Lundgren, flute Milton An
derson, piccolo Carl Kays, cornet.
The high school and the alumni
played a basket ball game in^the
high school gymnasium last Thurs
day night, which resulted in a vic
tory for the high school by a score
of 10'to 6.
Miss Olive Guy, from Fargo Col
lege, is visiting her friend, Miss Ol
son, this week.
The mid-year vacation will begin
Deci123,
1916, and will continue until
Moriday, Jan. 8, 1917. Our teachers
living outside of town will spend
their vacations at home with the ex
ception of Miss Cummings, who will
visit her sister in South Dakota.
Miss Wagner and Miss Ecklund
are planning a Christmas program
together for their pupils.
Washington Notes.
The seventh grade will have a
musical program, Friday afternoon.
Miss Lokken had "Mothers'
Day" on Tuesday. The children did
their Tegular work, no special^ pro
gram being held.
All of the rooms have been decor
ated for Chritsmas, especially those
of Misses Payden, Lokken and Hunt.
Miss Hunt has used a novel way of
decorating. The windows are given
a coat of bon-ami and then Christ
mas designs are stenciled on them.
The girls in the normal depart
ment have each made product maps
of five of the physical divisions of
the United States.
One corner of the room lately va
cated by Miss^Eklund is now inhab
ited by a tribe of Esquimoes. Of
course they live on the sand tat)le,
which is in charge of the normal
girls.
Alfred A. Peterson and family
departed yesterday for North Hen
derson, 111., where they will spend
the winter and probably make their
home again. In the family is an
old grandmother whose age is 91
years. The family moved here ten
years ago from Illinois. Recently
Mr. Peterson sold his farm here
and as Mrs. Peterson's health has
been poorly of late, they thought it
best to go away for a while. But
Mr. Peterson thinks it quite possi
ble that they will move back to
Warren soon. One jon, Clarence
Peterson, is married here and en
gaged in farming and some of the
other boys expect to return. The
many friends of the excellent fam
ily will welcome them back with
open arms.
The Sheaf has received a copy of
a new book in the Swedish language
bearing the title, "Under Pines and
Palms," by Alfred Bergin, D. D., of
Lindsborg, Kansas. In this volume
Dr. Bergin tells about his trip to
Europe in the memorable summer
of 1914. He started ahead of the
editor of the Sheaf hence was able
to make a tour of southern Europe
before the "war broke out. Dr.
Bergin always writes in an interest
ing manner anof he is a keen obser
ver. Having served as pastor of the
Swedish Lutheran churches in War
ren, Vega and Alvarado, he has
many friends here who doubtless
will want to read the book. It may
be had at the Sheaf book store,
price $1 per copy.

We extend to all our friends a
Merry Christmas!
The piano recital given last Fri
day evening was well attended even
tho the weather was cold and
stormy. The pupils were at their
best and are to be congratulated up
on their endeavors. We are proud
of the performers and their teachers.
The basket ball game between the
Newfolden boys and our boys re
sulted in a victory for the latter.
The score was 43 to 20. Quite a
number witnessed the game. A re
turn game had been scheduled for
Monday evening but owing to the
weather it had to be cancelled.
A movement is on foot to organize
a school orchestra. We find that we
have good talent for an organization
of this kind.
"Enrollment day after the holidays
comes January 8. We welcome all
our old students and many new
students to be on hand that day.
Do,not forget to take the oppoi'tan

All the stores have unique and
elaborate holiday displays. The wind

the attention of .all passers by. The

and a large beautiful landscape

artistic display in the store of the

regard to merchandising. The
stores of Warren would be a credit
to a city many times our size.
THE HOUSEWIFE GETS
HER MONEY'S WORTH.
Time was when the housewife
practiced loose methods in purchas
ing her foodstuffs.
But not in this age of the high
cost of living. .To-day she practices
business methods, and she makes it
a point to get her money's worth.
In her selection of foodstuffs she
devotes much thought. She studies
the food market and familiarizes
herself with the different brands of
foods.
When she strikes the right article
she sticks to it. She wants the best
at the lowest cost and she gets it if
she follows the right methods of sel
ection.
4 The housewife should give careful
consideration to the baking powder,
tea, .coffee, flour and other similar
foods if she is to get full value for
her money.
There is always one best brand in
every line, and it is the housewife's
du+v
to find that brand.
In purchasing foods be sure that
ynu practice caution and you'll get
th best.

Whole grain products are highly
recommended by physicians and
guardians of public health every
where as being more wholesome
than the ordinary finely sifted flour.
In these days when so much atten

rapidly growing industry.
Some local men as well as busi

new concern.
Animals in Christmas Customs.
The Christmas customs in Norway
and Sweden are the most interesting
of any country. It is a time of great
rejoicing. To show that there are
amicable feelings between every tne

retiring on Christmas Eve, and, like
the German custom, candles are leftL
Sheaves of grain are fastened to the
