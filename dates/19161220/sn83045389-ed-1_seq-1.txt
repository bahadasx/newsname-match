CLOTHES FOR SHIVERING POOR
Bundles Left at Fire Stations
Will Be Collected Next Thurs
day-by The Times-Dispatch.
Hundreds of closets. trunks and
ctdar chests in Richmond are filled
with discarded clothes, used only as
food for moths or as nn occasional gift
to iioitii> domestic or faithful liege.
These clothes, shoes. underwear. or
what not may he put to a better
utility, and the Associated Charities*
and The TimeB-Dispat'-h. if the public
win IipIi), have found and agreed upon
a worthy moans of disposing of the
elosot litter. They propose to aid in
distributing it among the poor, and
the disposition will be mad" in such
n manner as to cause the leust incon
venience and trouble to the donors.
Chief W. H. Joynos. of the Kire
partment. has agreed to U-nd the en
gine houses as collecting depots, and
the rest is easy. In response to the
the rest is cany.
The Idea of thus giving aid to the
poor and affording an easy means to
the public* to make donations was
conceived by The Tlmes-I ?ispatch. and
the suggestion was heartily indorsed
by the Associated Charities and by
Fire chief Joynes when his help was
solicited. Chief Joynes said he would
he glad to co-operate, and instructions
to the company captains to receive the
donations will be issued Hacked by
this co-operation. The Times-l ?ispatch
proceeds with the appeal, and every
bundle of clothing contributed will he
carted to the Associated Charitief by
The Times-Dispatch auto trucks free
of any expense. The public is invited
to co-operate. Secretary James Buch
anan. of the Associated Charities, will
supervise the distribution of the arti
cles among those who call weeklv for
something to protect them from the
cold.
Of the donors it is wsked that they
learn the location of the fire engine
house nearest to their various homos,
and th.'<t they wrap up into secure
bund leu such discarded appnrel as they
are willing t?> give and l?ave them at
the engine houses. The captain, or
other officer. in charge will receive the
packages, which should he marittd,

there may be no mistake as to v.hat
use they are to be put.
MOTOIt THICKS W1I.I-, fiATHKIt
FROM KMiINK HOt'SES
On Thursday of next week The
s Times-Dispatch will send automobile
trucks to ail the engine houses in the
city, and the collections will be t-?ken
to . the Associated Charities otlb es.
Her" is a means of helping the poor
with a minimum of trouble and with
the least expense.
In recommending this scheme, Iir.
Buchanan pointed out that it would be
a long, tedious and expensive task to
send collecting trucks to the homes
of all those who might he willing to
give. Jty the time the task were fin
ished warm weather would have come
again. Hut by this plan, if it be .suc
cessfully carried out, the relief will
he almost Immediate.
It Is asked that the gifts be taken
to the engine-houses not later than
Wednesday night of next week. ' ?ti
the. next day all the bundles will be
delivered, free of any expense, to the
Associated Charities, which will see to
it that they are properly distributed.

In the name of those who are unable
properly to clothe themselves in the
winter, and in the name of the hun
dreds of little children who must shiver
in the streets by day and lie beneath
thin coverlets at night. The Times
Dispatch asks for a generous response
to this appeal. Clothes, shoes, under
garments and bed clothes art; urgently
needed. There are hundreds of people
in Richmond who have wearing ap
parel and bed clothes which they have
long since 'discarded and left to the
?' ravage of moth and time. Yet every
piece of clothing thus thrown away
will fill some one's needs.
Your old suit or overcoat will keep
some man warm. My lady's Jacket will
bring comfort to some woman or girl
whose money is not enough even to
buy food. Your child's sweater or
shoes will warm the body and toes ?
some other's little one. it is a small
charity to ask, but it will he effec
tive in a large way. Kvery one who
has something to spare, from a child's
mils to a blanket, is asked to respond
as he or she would respond if the
appeal were made in person.

way ivas cleared in the Senate to-day
fur a final vote on Senator Sheppard's
l?lll for prohibition in tti?* District of

expected fllililister, it will he put on

measure expect It to pass.

referendum .if tin- miestion to district
residents. After many minor chances
had been made in its phraseology, the
amendment was beaten In committed
of the whole. 3S to 315. Senator Cnder
wood pave notice that lie would ask
for a separate vote for it when the
?bill comes up for "final action. Advo
cates of th" referendum still were hope
ful to-nit lit that the necessary ma
jority could be. found.
There is little eh a nee that the tie
can lie broken by Vice-President Mar
shall. since he is to leave Washincton
before the Senate convenes to-morrow.
Senator Sheppard showed a disposi
tion to press for a final vote to-niglit,
l>ut there was evidence that auv ;>t
tempt to do so would result in a fili
buster. and after much parliamentary
maneuvering, the Senate went into
executive session anil left the bill to
take the ordinary course to-morrow.

I'rgent representations are being made
to Turkey by (lie American govern
ment in an effort to secure the for
warding of relief supplies to British
prisoners of war. who were described
in a note receive,1 at the State Depart
ment to-day from the liritish embassy
to be in a most serious condition.
Ambassador 131 k us. at Constanti
nople. already lias sought diligently
but without success, permission to
send the men relief from a large fund
which has Weil placed at his disposal
by the Itritish government. Itrltish
and State Department reports indicate
I hat I he situation of the men is very
bad, but they give almost no details
as to their number or location.
The American ambassador is known
to be under ureal ditllcully in dealing
with Turkey, owing to the many seri
ous diplomatic questions which are
pressing between the two governments.
The situation is most delicate and dan
gerous. because a break in relations
would leave nearly all foreign interests
in Turkey without direct diplomatic
representation.

BOSTON, December l!t.? Boston wont
for licence to-day by the surprising
majority of more than 23.001) in a total
vote of nearly 84,000. There were 2,000
fewer "no" votes than in 1915. The
majority was one of the greatest in
Boston's history. The total vote on
the license question was: yes. 53,459;
no, 29.907.
Only two wards went for no license,
, Wards 21 and 23. The result was sim
ilar to last year's. Wards 24 and 2fi
be lilt? the only wards to record ft no
license vote.
The campaign waned by the advo
cates of no license, led by Billy Sun
day. the evangelist, was heated from
the start. The liquor interests con
fined themselves to newspaper adver
tising as far as publicity was con
cerned, but their antagonists endeav
ored to arouse support by employing
orators, hands, and to-day, automo
biles, while women, who have no vote
on the question, exerted themselves to
?vin converts to their cause.

The greatest surprise, greater even
than the size of the majority, is the
falling off in the "no" vote. This is
j explained in some quarters on the
theory that many men who have been
j in the (nihil of voting "no" academi
cally, cast "yes" ballots when they
realized that there was a possible
| chance of the city going dry and thus
| closing the bars of clubs and hotels,
as well as those ??f saloons.
Mr. Sunday's secretary, when in
formed of the result, said: "Mr. Sun
j day all day has not shown any par
| tlcular eagerness to get the returns.
! lie has done the best he could for the
i 'drys,' hut he has realized all along
1 tliat many of the 'dry* sympathisers
live out of town. The matter is ap
parently closed?though we could wish
it was dosed differently?and Mr. Sun
day will now go back to his wont of
saving souls."

I My Associated !
I<()N'DOX, December I ?The an
nouncement in the Mouse of Commons
to-day by David Lloyd George, the
now Prime Minister, thai the first act
of his administration was the rejec
tion of the proposal of the cent rat
powers for a peace conference consti
tuted one of iii? most momentous
scenes which the oldest parliamentary
veterans evjr ha', witnessed.
The new Premier declared that be
fore the allies ci uld give favorable
consideration to such an invitation,
they must know that (Germany w .<
prepared to accede to the allies' terms,
giving "complete restitution, full re
parations and effectual guarantees,"
and "to enter a conference upon the
nvitation of tiertnany, proclaiming
.terseif victorious, without any knowl
edge of her proposals, would be put
'ing our heads Into a noose, wit*
etui of the rope In Germany's hands.''
Lloyd George asserted that :it th>
moment Germany was penning' the
note, assuring her convictions as to
the rights of other nations, she was
dragging Belgians into slavery. F."
announced that the note presented
i through Washington contained no pro
; posals of terms, but was a paraphrase
of Chancellor von Kcthmanu-Mollweg's
speech, anil that the allies had sepa
rately concluded to reject it. although
they had informally- exchanged views,
and would within a few days present
a Joint reply.
; DIV ISION or I'HRMIKIt
SKl'OXDKI) IIV AMll'lTl!
Mr. Asquith, the former Premier,
seconded Lloyd George's decision with
even stronger words, and almost ai
the same moment tear I Curzon was in
forming t lie Lords that the govern
ment would enter no conference that
did not guarantee for Europe the free
and independent existence of nations,
great and small. The Marquis o
Crewe altlrmcd tin* approval of the
members of the late government.
The day was a doubly important one
for tlie Commons, because the n> ,
Premier unfolded his program
wide-reaching war measures, and Mr.
Astl'Jith closed the last chapter as
nine years of leadership with an ac
counting of his war stewardship.
The principal feature of Lloyd
George's program is a measure for
national service, matching Germany's
latest scheme, whereby every citizen
will be liable for enrollment, to per
form work for which the authorities
consider him best equipped.
Arthur Neville Chamberlain, Mayor
of Hirmingham, and a member of the
famous family, will be director of
national service, with civil and mili
tary directors responsible to him.
The Premier prefaced his review of
the situation by the statement that
liritons did their best in time of dan
ger; that the country should be told
unpleasant facts, and that he would
give, not a dark, but a stern, view
of the outlook.
lie deplored the mistakes that had
been made regarding Uoumatiia. He
said tlie government had decided t<?
deal (Irmly with Greece, and would
i recognize the agents of former Premier
Venizelos.
The history of the alliance bad been
one of tartly decision. The central
. powers had the great advantages or
internal communication and working
under one supreme management, whib.
the policy of the entente allies had
been too much one of separate fronts.

Kisinu in the House a few minutes
j after I o'clock, tlie Prime Minister said:
"1 appear liefoie the House of Com

sponsibility that can fall upon tliu
shoulders of any living man as chief
adviser of the crown, in the most
uiuantlc war.in which this country was

of which its destiny depends. It is tho
greatest war ever waged; the burdens
