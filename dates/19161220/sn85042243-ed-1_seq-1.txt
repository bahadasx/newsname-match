While responses fikve been good, it Is

All contributions should be sent di­

Why Not Up With the Curtains?
Up with the curtains Christmas
eve and Christmas night in Bismarck.
Let tbe city be a blaze of light. Busi­
ness men, ministers and others—all
prominent in tbe growth and the pros­
perity of the city—were unanimous
yesterday in voicing their opinions
that in every residence the blinds
should be raised with the lighting of
tbe Christmas trees in order that the
good eheer within might be spread to
the "little world? of Bisma'rclr out
»ld«-
"That's as it should be," declared
Dr. W. J. Hutcheton, pastor of tbe
Methodist church, When questioned as
to bis opinion this afternoon. "I am
heartily In favor of it." Others who
were broached on the idea gave state­
ments of a similar tone.
Mrs. Ounn Favors the Movement.
"I heartily endorse the movement to
have'all the curtains In" tbe ^Bismarck
homes raised on Christmas- night and
Christmas eve," said Mrs. J. P. Dunn,
president of the Civic league when
seen yesterday. The league president
w]«n
bad another idea in mind. She
hoped the time would come when res­
idents of Bismarck would revive that
old custom of keeping an open house
on New Year's day.
Spirit of Christmas Arrives.
The spirit of Christmas arrived in
Bismarck last week with a four-inch
fall of snow, assuring a white Christ­
mas. Stores are now open until late
in the evening and have experienced
throngs of shoppers during the even­
ing. Officers of the Salvation army
brave the subsero temperatures and
stand on the principal'corners of the
streets, guardians over their kettles,
while bells are rung for contributions
for baskets for the poor on Christmas
day. A splendid start was made with
the army kettles on Saturday when
the sum of $27.19 was raised for the
day. However, the cold snap of Mon­
day had a detrimental effect on the
"warming up" process, Monday's in­
come amounting to only $8.46.
The army workers on the investiga­
tions are going at their business thor
oughly and by tomorrow evening the
captain reports, he expectes to have
a list of his actual requirements for
Christmas relief. The baskets and
stockings will be delivered by Santa
Claus Saturday afternoon. But until
then the word of the Salvation army
officers to the pedestrians will be to
"keep the kettles boiling."

GUILTY TO COM
OF EMBEZZLEKRT
Springs Sensation at Opening of
Morning 8ession of District
Court
With three-fourths of the chairs in
the Jury box filled, Attorney George
H. Purchase, of Halliday, facing trial
in the district court for embezzlement
charge, sprang a sensation at the
opening of the session this morning
by pleading guilty through his coun­
sel. Sentence will be passed by Judge
Nuessle on January 16. Ball bonds
were fixed at $2,000.
Amount Mentioned I2J025.28
The prosecution alleged that Pur­
chase as attorney for Charles Jent
ten, administrator of the estate of the
late Andrew Lipter of Dunn county
did "by virtue of said employment r»
ceive and take into his possession a
certain check for $2,025.08 and appro­
priated it to his own use." About 12
witnesses bad been subpoened by the
prosecution, the case being called late
yesterday afternoon.
Forgery Charge Dismissed.
Tbe forgery charge growing out of
the same transaction was dismissed
when the plea of guilty was entered
shortly after 9:30 o'clock. Purchase
agreed to return all the funds misap­
propriated.
Sentence for an offense of this na­
ture is said to be from one to live
years and will probably result in hts
being disbarred from practicing law
in North Dakota.
Array of Legal Lights.
An array of legal talent was pres­
ent when the case was called. Thom­
as G. Johnson of Killdeer, state's at­
torney for Dunn county, headed the
prosecution. Assisting him were H.
J. Linde. attorney general T. D. Cas­
ey of Dickinson, special counsel re­
presenting the estate, and City Attor­
ney McCurdy of Bismarck, who was
procured to aid in the selection of
the jury.
Counsel for the defense were T. E.
Murtha of Dickinson, Miller, Zuger
and Tillotson of Bismarck and Attor­
ney Stark of Dickinson. Mr. Pur­
chase once practiced law at James­
town, Bismarck, Beach and Richarton.
Before coming to this state he served
with the police force at Superior, Wis.
He was a witness in the famous im­
peachment trial several years ago of

Berlin, Dec. 20. From December,
1915, to December, 1916, British
and French war vessels seized
24,500 mail bags bound for Ger­
many and 15,800 mail bags bound
for Austria, the press bureau stat
today. It is estimated that of
these 11,000 bags were bound to
the United 8tates atfd 13,000 were
bound from the United 8tates to
Germany. Many were enroute to
South America. It is believed
that British and French censors
read the mail in these bags and
this may account for the British

OEFMAN PRESS COMMENT.
(By Associated Press.)
Amsterdam, via London, Dec. 20.—
Commenting on Premier Lloyd
George's speech, the Tegeiiche Rumd
schau of Berlin says:
"Reparation could be demanded by
England only if Germany had declar­
ed war on 'England, if we were to
blame for the war, if we had commit­
ted a«crime against international law,
and if we had been defeated."
The Lokal Anzeiger takes the view­
point that Mr. Lloyd George's remarks
about reparation are of no value, in­
asmuch as nothing has been said thus
far about peace conditions. This pa­
per continues:
"If Lloyd George means to postpone
satisfying Europe's desire for peace
until the time when the Entente is
successful in conquering Germany's
armies and those of her allies, then
the whole of Europe, as well as Lloyd
George, knows full well that this an­
nouncement means eternal war unless
it is in the power of the German com­
mand to bring it to an earlier termi­
nation than Lloyd George supposes."

APPOINT N1IS
Named for Two X*urs at Salary
of $1500 Per—Begins Office
Tenure January 1
The city commissioners in ses­
sion last evening appointed Edward
E. Morris for a term of two years
as city assessor, at a salary of $1,500
a year. The appointment was recom­
mended by Commissioner R. C. Bat*
tey, and concurred in by President A.
W. Lucas and Commissioner,', Chris
Eertsch.
The appointment marks a new pro­
cedure in matters relative to the as­
sessment of city property, collection
of fines, taxes and the taking of the
city census, creating a department
similar to that in Fargo and Grand
Forks, with a m'ah oti the J&b brihU&t
ly instead of a period of days as
formerly. It is believed that this de­
partment will save the city annually
more than the salary of the man at
the head, who will watch all property
subject to taxation, that none escapes.
Poll taxes, too, will be collected by
this department, as-well as statistics
kept which will be of special value for
reference.
Edward E. Morris will enter upon
his official duties the first of the year.
His office will in all probability be
located in the city hall. He has made
a number of assessments in the city.

There was no pay-day at the capitol

Notices have been served on the
state treasurer and the state auditor
by Attorney William Lemke, repre­

them to Issue no vouchers and pay no
salaries to the three retiring supreme
court judges. Mr. Lemke styles the
provisional supreme tribunal a "kan­

bers possessed no more authority than
"any other four men who might have
been picked up on the street."
Trouble Anticipated.
Anticipating some action of this na­
ture, Auditor Jorgenson at the last
meeting of the auditing board, sug­
gested that a resolution be adopted in­
structing him to issue warrants for all
elective officers except the retiring
members of the supreme court. This
action was not taken, and as a result,
operating under the rule which al­
ways has obtained of considering the
official pay-roll in a lump, the state
auditor before leaving Sunday for
Fargo instructed Deputy Edwards to
hold up the entire payroll until his re­
turn next Saturday.

BELL
(United Press)
El Paso, Dec. 20.—With the declara­
tion that he would give every assist­
ance to deserters from the United
States army, who finally crossed tbe
border into Mexico, General Gonzales,
Carranza commandant at Juarez, in a
statement issued today, bitterly as­
sailed General Bell, commander of the
American forces here for his failure
to return to the Mexican officer, Com
maduran. He escaped into the Unit­
ed States territory.
General Bell, claiming the case to
be either civil or political, said today
he has no authority to return Com
maduran upon a military order from
Mexico.
Gonzales, in the statement issued
today, cited that several orders issued
upon the United States authorities for
the return of Commaduran had failed,
The United States authorities here
had heard that Commaduran had been
sent to Juarez to replace General Gon­
zales, but that Commaduran had been
routed from his new command by Gon­
zales.
On the other hand Gonzales claims
that Commaduran had been ordered
to Chihuahua City, but that he had
fled here with government funds. Gon­
zales denied that Commaduran bad
been ordered to replace him.
HUGE BLUFF
SAYS GERIANY
(By United Press.)
Berlin, Dec. 20.—Germany today re­
gards the speeches of statesmen in
England, France and Russia, in an­
swer to Germany's peace proposals as
a huge bluff, made to impress Berlin
with the Entente's determination to
continue the war.
In view of their recent speeches
and interviews these statesmen could
not do otherwise at this time, al­
though they are really anxious for
peace.
This was the view taken in all
walks of life here today, following
the speech of David Lloyd George in
the British house of commons yester­
day.
Berlin remained optimistic today.
The general view is that the speeches
are not to be taken seriously when
weighed against acts of the officials
of .the Entente Allies.
It was generally regarded that steps
toward peace taken by a neutral
would not be regarded as friendly at
this time.

(By United Press.) 1
Washington, Dec. 20.—Secret diplo­
macy is to be tbe next move in tbe
big peace game.
This became evident here today. It
is likely that England will be willing'
to have publicity given her answer.
But it is doubted if Germany will con*
sent to publicity of her next move.
These facts convinced United States
authorities that it will he well to
keep hands off for tbe present. This
government will pass along all: nego­
tiations and thus will know at all
times what is being done.
Met Peacemaker.
This government is anxious to serve
humanity in the promotion of peace,
hut it Is unlikely it will assume the
attitude of a peacemaker to get the
black eye that usually goes with the
office.
It is considered almost certain that'
an international league will be con­
sidered imperative. The view of
President Wilson and Secretary Lan­
sing is known to be that peace is so
vital to the world that it would not
only be a diplomatic courtesy, but a
fatal blunder to give undue publicity
to peace moves now.
Nationalization of British shipping,
mentioned briefly by Premier Lloyd
George as one of the first acts of the
new ministery, commands more inter­
est here from the strictly American
point of view than any other phase of
the premier's speech.
Opens New Controversy.
What effect it would have on Amer­
ican foreign trade or on tbe status
of British ships sunk by German sub
marines has opened a new anA yfrex-'
pfe&ed series of questions whicnof
ficials regard with much concern.
The taking into the national s#rv«
ice of the whole merchant maritae fol­
lowing closely on England's announce­
ment that she could not guarantee
coal at any of her coaling stations the
world over, except to ships conserv­
ing allied interests is thought by offi­
cials at first glance to turn over the
great majority of the world's carrying
trade to war purposes.
The effect on commerce for Ameri­
can purposes and not of service to tbe
Allies is problematical, especially as
to the completeness with which Lloyd
George enforces the order. Neverthe­
less. there is in the law nothing the
United States can do should the whole
British merchant marine be with­
drawn from American trade and har­
bors.
"I TOLD YOU SO."
(By United Press.)
Washington, Dec. 20.—"I told yoll
so" is the sentiment of the German
embassy today. It was pointed out
that ten months ago Ambassador von
LernstorlT told the United Prefis that
there would be no successful peace
moves until the ministers that had
brought about the war had been re­
placed.
LLOYD GEORGE LEAVES
E OPEN
(United Press)
Amsterdam, Dec. 20.—ft Lloyd
George expects the war to go on un­
til .Germany is crushed, the war will
go on eternally, until German armies
complete it, German newspapers
which arrived here today say.
Did Not Close Dodr.
The Allies have not femmed the
door in the face of Germairy peace
messengers. The AllieA, instMtd,
merely said to Germany "Ddn come
again in the attitude of a victor."
This was the view taken today Of
Premier Lloyd George's speech In the
house of commons yesterday. It was
regarded that if Germany really
wants peace, she now knows how to
come about it.
Lloyd George has destroyed Q*
many's idea that England dominated
the Entente Allies, according to pop
ular belief. His statement at the ont
set of the speech that the Allies had
reached the same decision certainly
seemed to have established no domi­
nation by one ally over the balance.
Lloyd George's speech was general*
ly accepted here today without oppo­
sition. "The country is Lloyd
George's. What is he going to do with
