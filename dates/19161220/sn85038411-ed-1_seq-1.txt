statement taking him to task lor a '
I veto.
"I was very much surprised to see j
! the statement in the newspapers as j
coming from the Governor that lie is j
i opposed to capital punishment for the ■
reason that during the last session of
! the Legislature he vetoed a bill that
would have virtually done away with j
this." said Mr. Baldwin. "Its passage
was largely due to my efforts. The- j
bill left jury in a murder case
to deter) the sentence:
i should Ifc imprisonment or not;
i and in tliißTiaturaliy meant the aboli- !
tion of capital punishment in Penn
sylvania. But Governor Brumbaugh
vetoed the-bill when it came before
i bim aja rfpw at this late date he is
against capital punishment.
A similar bill will be presented to the i
next assembly and 1 hope the execu- j
! tive will again reverse himself." j
Mr. Baldwin declared that he had
\ been visited by some members of the ;

they would vote for Baldwin. He said

Germans Claim Allies
Have Seized 40,135 Bags
of Mail Illegally
Berlin, Dec. 20, by wireless.—From j
j December of 1915 until the last of J
j September, 1916, the British and
| French naval authorities seized 23,-
I ;i35 mail bags from Germany and 10,-
: SoO bound for Germany," says the
i < >verseas News Agency. "Of those
; from Germany, 17,110 bags of mail
| were bound for the United States and
0,225 were bound for South Anierica
!or Spain. Of the mail bags on the
way to Germany, 13,857 were from the
i I'll.led States and 2,-138 from
l South America or Spain. The re
l maining bags were in transit between
| Germany and Dutch ports.
"It is shown by notes inscribed on
' the few letters which were released
! and forwarded to Germany that the
! letters seized wore read by both Brit
i isli and French censors, who appar
! ently exchange seized mails, reading
I the letter to gain a clear insight into
j trade relations of citizens of tlie
j Cnited State;; and South American
I countries with Germany. Thus is
! made possible establishment of the
I blacklist and other measures.
"The German Transportation Ga

tional Postal Union treaty, which is
; valid In war times, but also of the con

! ference at The Hague."

Pays 22 Mills School Tax
but Children Are Getting
No "Schooling" He Says
When a mas pays a school tax of
r j22 mills on the dollar, shouldn't his
, children have an opportunity to go to
school?
J. A. Fisher, of Juniata township,
. Huntingdon county, was asking that
question of State school authorities In
Harrisburg to-day. Fisher complains
■ that Ihe Stone Bridge school in his
township has not been opened this
' year and that a dozen pupils have not
1 had any "schooling" for that reason.
! "The school directors say they won't
! open the school," said Fisher to the
1 Telegraph. "Under the terms of the
■ school code, they must either open the
1 school or, where the distance to an
other school is over a mile and a half,
1 furnish transportation to that school.
• Our school directors say they will do
5 neither. It's four miles to the next
■ sclioolhouse—much too far to walk."
"What did Dr. Scliaeffer say about
' it?"
5 "Well," said Fisher, "Dr. Schaeffer
I said I was singularly unfortunate ill
I I living in a township so backward a*
'inline seems to be. But that doesn't
- get my four children to school. 1
| might take the directors into court,
■ | but I'm a poor man; 1 can't afford it.

■ fix things for me."

NEGROES KILL
LABOR FOREMAN
NEAR NEWVILLE
Bent in His Head With Shovel
When Me Refuses to Let

ASSAILANTS IN JAIL
Wanted Fuel lo Burn in Their
Shacks to Keep Them
From Freezing
j Carlisle, Pa., Dec. 2 o.—The sudden,

| son for tlie murder of William Ury, - ]
( 1 a foreman in charge of construction
: work on the Cumberland Valley rati
• road, at the hands of three negroes.
I The night was bitter cold and the
. negroes started to take coal from tho
I contractor's supply to heat up their
shacks. When Ury tried to prevent
: tlie theft of (lie coal an argument j
• 1 resulted and one of the negroes hit ■
■ 1 the foreman over the head with a,
• j shovel, crushing in his skull.
Ury was rushed to the Carlisle Jlos- JS
pltal, but he died at 2 o'clock this
- morning. He was, 30 years old and J
I came from North Carolina to take
> ' charge of l tie construction job here.
: I It is understood that the man who
l struck Foreman Ury was Jatnes An
j thony. It appears that Charles Ham
let went to the pumping engine and
started to take away coal used under
the boiler to make tire at the shanty.
| Ury tried to prevent this and got into
a quarrel with Hamlet. William Wal
j ton tried to stop the light, but was un
• successful. Anthony then came up to
the party and struck Ury with tho
y j sharp edge of the shovel, cutting
- through the skull. Ury was lirst taken
I! to his home at Newville and later
cj brought to the hospital here, where
-I he died. His wife, who has been ill
rI for seme time, is now in a serious
n condition from shock.
