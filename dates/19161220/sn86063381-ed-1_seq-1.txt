INTEREST IN MUNICIPAL TREE
GROWS EVERYBODY TO HELP
Splendid Forest-Specimen Is to Be
Colorful Queen Esther's Re
ceive Hearty Support.
Bemidji is certainly going to have
a Carnival association that IS a car
nival association and the membership
campaign has already reported over
100 names as members. To be exact,
at 10 o'clocq this morning 101 names
had been turned in to Secretary Rey
nolds and only a fairly good start can
be said to have been made.
Interest in the Municipal Christ
mas tree, first broached by the Queen
Esther society, is spreading rapidly
and it seems as if everybody is
anxious to in some manner be of as
sistance in the promotion of the pro
ject. President McDonald of the Car
nival association is authority for the
statement that the tree will be a
whopper, a splendid specimen and one
that Santa Glaus himself would be
proud to own.
Mayor Vandersluis and F. S. Lycan,
president of the city council, while
not officially designated as represen
tatives of the city government, are
ending all aid and in the interest of
emidji.
All May Hear
In all probability the tree will be
set near the library at a point to al
low a large crowd to mass and be
enabled to witness and hear the pro
gram asi presented. The tree will be
"brilliant and colorful in its kaleido
scopic decoration and, once erected,
will be allowed to shine throughout
the evenings during the entire Christ
mas week and just prior to the ar
rival of the New Yeah.
It has been too cold to secure the
tree but it will be up in time and
Alderman Tom Smart will see that
the big forest inhabitant is Johnny
on the spot for the opening qf_t.he
"week's festival.
Going to St. Paul.
Approximately 32 have signified
their intention of making the trip to
,St. Paul to participate in the big
parade as representing Bemidji. Al
ready the costumes to be worn are
being seen on Bemidji's streets and
.are attracting much attention. Be
midji and Beltrami county should be
well represented at St. Paul and
everyone is welcome to join. Secre
tary Reynolds urges a large attend
ance and an immediate notification of
just how many will make the trip.
The suits to be worn to St. Paul is
the official suit of the local carnival
association, although for the local or
ganization may be varied so long as
the red and white color scheme is
-carried out.
Those in charge of the tree celebra
tion are today active in details and
the affair, the first of its nature for
Bemidji, promises much in many
ways.

MaineCounty Made*
Richest in the U.S.
By Humble Potato
(By United Press)
Houlton, Me., Dec. 20.Aroostock
county today is the richest county
in the United States. The northern
most county of Maine snatched the
crown from Los Angeles county, Cali
fornia.
The humble potato did it.
Potatoes that sold for 75 cents
a barrel a few years ago now bring
$4.75 and farmers nere are holding
much of their crop for 5 a barrel.
As a esult of this unprecedented
prosperity, Houlton is now the sec
ond richest town in the country,
ranking next to Brookline, the rich
est in the world.
Fifty carloads of automobiles, not
flivvers, are on their way here.
It is estimated that $100,000 is
coming into this county daily from
the potato crop alone.
This is no real estate boom, for
you can't buy enough ground to bury
a potato to its eye.

At the beginning of the holiday

Chief of Police Ripple visited sev

need of many articles.
"What do you want for Christ-

girl.
"I have'nt thought anything about
it," she answered. "We don't expect
much of a Christmas. There are
eight children in our family and I am

13.50 a week but after the rent is
paid, it is hard to feed us all."

Chief Makes Rounds of

hoping for some assistance from the
Associated Charities this Christmas.
The number of needy families* is
not any larger than in previous years
despite the high cOst of living. This
is accounted for by the fact that
there is employment for all in Be
midji at good wages.
The fifty families, whose names
have been secured by Associated
Charity officials, are very much in
need. They were "brought to their
knees" mostly by sickness. They
need food, principally, and the kid
dies want some toys to play with just
like other youngsters.
The Associated Charities fund with
the aid of generous contributors
will teed, clothe and give toys to
many of them. Just how many, of
course, depends on the amount of
money contributed to the fund or the
amount of food stuffs or clothing.
Each additional contribution means
another happy family.
Every Little Kelp*,
if you can give to the fund don't
delay. dSvery dollar which can be
shared should be donated to this
splendifi charity. If you-'have
clothes or food stuffs that yon wish
to contribute, the committee will ar
range for the distribution. Send the

"I don't believe we will even be

Christmas," said the good mother.
"Everything is so high and the
children need clothes."
Caste 4.A family of ten, eight
children, five girls and three boys.
If any charitable person could see the
way this family exists there is no
question that they would be taken
care of. Shoes, stockings and food
are needed. The father earns $13.50
a week, must pay rent and the entire
balance is used for food. Under
present conditions, no matter how
careful the buyer, $13.50 will not
reach very far.
Brave Little Chaps.
While these thinly garbed young
sters are yearning for toys, just like
other girls and boys they are not
asking for them as much as for food.
They want playthings badly but they
want bread, and eggs, and meat much
worse.
Each of the poor in Bemidji has a
separate plea, which, if prosperous
citizens could' hear it, would draw
forth a contribution to relieve such
dire distress. Many contributions
have been received by the Associated
Charities from generous donors, but
more are needed to guarantee food
and playthings too, for the depend
ents.
To feel that you have given to a
fund which aids the ragged, poverty
worn families and which accom
plishes much good will be the best
Christmas gilt you have ever had.

Right for Women
(By United Press)
Denver, Colo., Dec. 20.-Colorado
women are completing plans today
to force through the legislature next
month Judge Ben Lindsey's bill pro
viding maternity benefits and Enti
tled "Horsles' Rights for Women."
The bill, the first of its kind in this
country, provides that a working wo
man expecting to become a mother
may receive state aid for a period
both before and after maternity.
"Thousands of women and girls
work till within a few days of becom
ing mothers," Judge Lindsey said to
day, "and then return to work while
still weak. Their health and often
that of their children is permanently
injured. My bill would simply pro
vide that the state give them the
same periods of rest that any wise
and humane farmer gives a horse or
a cow at such a time.
"At present we take better care of
our cattle than we do of our mothers
I believe such a bill as 'Horses
Rights for Women' would do away
with this evil. I feel that if we can
get it adopted in Colorado other
states will soon fall in line and it
will become a national reform."
