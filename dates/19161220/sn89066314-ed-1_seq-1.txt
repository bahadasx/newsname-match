"We are losing thousands of dollars
because tourists avoid Missouri, be
cause of our abominable roads.
"Don't hang back and wait to be

FACTORY
IS STILUNMCE
Failure of Company to Meet
Condition Halts Transfer
of Land Promised.
HAS TO EMPLOY 600
Organization May Be Re
quired to Contract for 6
Years Will.Not Move.
The Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company
has no intentions of closing down or
moving its Columbia factory. That
assurance from the president of the
company was read at a meeting last
night of the board of directors of the
Commercial Club and the trustees of
the shoe factory property. "Our Co
lumbia factory is now on a most satis
factory basis, and we intend to operate
it Indefinitely,""Vritcs the president.
Ten years ago citizens of Columbia
by raising $60,'000 brought the fac
tory here, and the meeting last night
was called to consider a proposal to
give the company a deed for the prop
erty. Contracts were presented by
the shoe company, but these were not
entirely satisfactory to the trustees
and directors, .and tie matter of fur
ther negotiations was left to a com
mittee, with E. C. Anderson as chair
man. Contract Clause Xot Fulfilled.
According to the original contract
with the company, it wa3 to receive
the deed to the property after ten
5'ears. If It had fulfilled the provis-
Ions of the contract. One clause in
particular was not fulfilled. The
company was to have between 600 and
700 persons working here at the end
of ten years, but today the factory em
ploys only 389, and the average for
nine years is 362.
The Commercial Club directors
rerommended that a warranty deed be
ston the shoe company now, provid-
ing it agreed to employ at. least 362
persons, the nine-year average, for
six years more, or a larger number
for a correspondingly shorter time,
and to give a bond for $25,000 to be
forfeited in case the new contract
was not fulfilled.
Addition Planned to Contract.
This was in addition to the contract
proposed by the shoe company, in
which it agreed to assume all obli
gations of the trustees. The employ
ing of 362 persons for six years more
portant clause of the original contract
would be satisfactorily fulfilled.
In the contracts it proposed, the
company, although stating that it in
tends to operate the factory Indefinite
ly, promised to run its plant here for
at least five years at a capacity suf
ficient to supply the demand for its
retail store in St. Louis. The Hamilton-Brown
Company claims the ca
pacity of its plant here has been cut
down to about 400 persons, as the re
sult of the introduction of labor-saving
machinery. ""
The Commercial Club directors art
anxious to have the opinions of all
business men and citizens before any
contracts are signed.
Club to Prepare for Visitors.
The Commercial Club is making ar
rangements again this year to find

WASHINGTON. Dec. 20. The Unit
ed States, in common with other neu
tral nations will be interested in any
world peace guarantee or disarma
ment discussion that may follow the
present peace proposal situation, it
was officially stated this afternoon.
United States officiate have talked
informally of a world guarantee as es
sential to any final peace terms. It
is assumed, as previously pointed out
in United Press dispatches, that this
Government would take an active hand
in furthering such ideas if the United
Statc3 found them to be welcomed by
belligerents. The President feels that
when the time monies for this govern
ment to take any move in tho peace
situation, it will be made clear that
the United States is not Interescd in
the causes of the European outbreak,
but only in the issue of permanent
peace.
The means of establishing this, the
President believes, are ital to this
nation, because in every way the Unit
edStates "either will be or will not
be" vitally affected.
By United Tress
LONDON, Dec. 20. The Allies have
not slammed the door on peace. They
have simply said to Germany: "Here
are our peace terms. Take them or
leave them. It is your move, but do
not -come in again in the role of vic
tor." This was the general British view-
today when the public had an oppor
tunity to digest the full meaning of
Lloyd-George's speech in the House
of ' Commons. The public interpreta
tion was that Lloyd-George had fur
nished von Bethmann-Hollweg an op
portunity to demonstrate his sincerity.
If Germany really desires peace, Eng
land argues, Germany now knows how
to go about it. Incidentally, it was
marked here today how adroitly and
strikingly Lloyd-George had destroyed
Germany's allusions to the effect that
England is dominating the policy of
the Entente nations. The Premier, it
is recalled, had stated at the outset
that Uussian and Franco, acting inde
pendently and separately, had reached
conclusions to which England now ac
ceded. Lloyd-George's plans for a universal
national service and civil mobilization,
which mean moving the nation into an
army behind the army, were accepted
'today as though they were the simp
lest routine of peace time. Not a com
plaint, not the slightest thought of op
position, was manifested. The press
and the man in the street reflected the
universal sentiment. The country is
with Lloyd-George.
