CHRISTMAS SHOP
PERS III CROWDS
Denison Stores Enjoy Unusual Holiday
Trade—Saturday the Busiest Day
for Years for Merchants
STORES NEVER LOOKED BETTER
AM Sorfts of Holiday. Displays Ar
ranged and Purchasers Had Large
Assortments to Choose From
The Denison stores have been
thronged with Christmas shoppers for
the past week and with only three
more shopping days until the happy
event, merchants are looking forward
to unprecedented buying. The stores
of Denison have never looked as won
derful as they do this year. Store
"windows are all decorated and goods
displayed in them give only a hint
of innumerable things to be found in
side. Many of the stores have taken
special pains to decorate the interior
of their stores, making them most at
tractive.
Saturday was the busiest day in
Denison for years and the streets were
thronged all day with a merry crowd
of shoppers. Hundreds of automo
biles were parked in the business sec
tion, many of them coming from points
fifty miles distant. The roads were
excellent last week and notwithstand
the trip to Denison in autos to do
ing the weather was cold, people made
their shopping.
Christmas trees made their appear
ance on the local market last week
and there has been great demand for
them. They range In price from 25c
for the r$al small ones on ap to sev
eral dollars.
Never before have the merchants
done as much as they have this year
to make things pleasant and easy for
the shopper. All 3orts of holiday dis
plays were made early this year and
the women who wanted to get their
shopping out of the way early had the
best of assortments to choose from,
found the clerks interested and at
tentive and delivery service good.
Although most commodities have in
creased in price this year a large as
sortment of gifts at moderate prices
is being shown by dealers in most
lines and in many cases the inexpens
ive gifts may be quite as attractive as
the more costly ones.
Though imported toys are rare there
&re some being shown in Denison.
Tliere Is a. bewildering display of.
toys
at several stores and it is quite as
difficult as in days of yore to get the
youngsters through these special de
partments without spending all of
father's money. The dolls are espe
cially attractive this seasoA and al
though some of the old varieties from
rriTT?
XlJu
In French ivory, ebony, silver inlaid, ma
hogany, boxwood and white enamel. All in
fancy cases containing from three to ten pieces.
If you want to save money on a fine Christmas
gift, here's your chance. Regular $1 to $8
values offered for this week at 20 per cent off.
Europe are missing there are plenty of
new ones to take their places. For
the boys there are mechanical toys
and contrivances of all kinds, most
tempting tool chests for manual train
ing work and balls and tops and horns
and sleds, all new and shining, to de
light the little folks on Christmas eve.
In the stores and departments de
voted especially to the feminine inter
ests the displays were never more
dainty and attractive than they are
this season. Handkerchiefs, gloves
and hosiery are always staple and
make a most acceptable gift. Silk
stockings of all grades have been af
fected by the advance in prices and
,stockings for small folks are hard to
secure in all varieties, but the/ lines
to select from are the best to be had
and the accommodating clerks will
put them in fancy boxes for you, al
ready for gifts.
Handkerchiefs were never shown in
so attractive a variety and at prices
to suit every purse. Collars, ties and
all sorts of fancy neckwear are ajso
popular for gifts and show a -wide
range in price. Gloves, like silk stock
ings, are more expensive this year
than last season on account of the
war, but nevertheless many are being
sold.
'While the tendency this year seems
to be towards the less expensive gifts,
still a large number of handsome gifts
are being, purchased, and jewelry, fur
niture, rugs, talking machines, furs,
cut glass and china are all selling
well. Silver is always a most ac
ceptable gift for Christmas and the
jewelry stores are showing many
handsome patterns.
As the buying of presents for men
is always more or less of a problem
the merchants this year are assisting
the shoppers by making special dis
plays of things adapted to the mascu
line tastes. Books, leather goods and
all sorts of standard accessories to
the masculine toilet are being shown
attractively boxed for mailing or giv
ing. Of course the range of selection
is limited .as compared with the fem
inine gifts but there is certainly more
chance of pleasing the men folks this
year than there has been for several
seasons.
In spite of the war quantities of odd
little things are being shown, many of
which are imported from China and
Japan. Baskets, trays, nut bowls,
Candlesticks and trifles for the desk
or library table. Some are beautiful
while others are odd. but all command
the attention of the shopper.
There is an especially big line'of
Christmas cards and stickers this year
and made up in designs that are new
and novel. Little gifts for mailing,
put up In
{dainty Boxeswith pretty
cards bearing a rhyme or sentiment,
are most attractive.
The light fall of snow and touch of
zero weather has added much to the
Christmas buying spirit the. past few

RECEPTION FOR
REV. HAMILTON
if
Big Meeting Held on Tuesday Evening
•to Welcome Rev. Hamilton
Fine Talks' Are Made.
JOYFUL TIME HAD BY' ALL
Members From All Churches of City
on Hand and Royai Wcicome
Given New Bapltist Minister
One of the notable events in church
history of Denison was the formal re
ception given tlie pas Lor or the Bap
tist church. Rev. C. R. Hamilton, on
yesterday evening. The program was
in charge of a committee of which
Mrs. H. A. Norman was chairman.
The church and prayer meeting
rooms were tastily decorated in holi
day attire. The exercises opened by
singing by a double male quartet.
This church is most fortunate in hav
ing quite a large group of men who
have good voic-es. Rev. J. L. Boyd, of
the Methodist church, was first called
to extend the greeting of his society
to the new pastor. Rev. Boyd was in
his happiest mood and with many
pleasing stories and reminiscences he
gave welcome to his fellow minister.
He called attention to the fact that in
past years in some communities it
would have been impossible for pastors
and people of the leading religious or
ganizations to come together in gen
uine fellowship and praise of the good
work done by ea«h separately.
The greeting's on behalf of the
Presbyterian church were extended by
the able and popular pastor. Rev. J. C.
Tourtellot. He pledged that he and
his people were ready to join hand in
hand with tJiose of the sister churches
to advance the cause of Christ's king
dom in this community. He had heard
only good words spoken of Rev. Ham
ilton during the weeks he had been
here and believed that his praises had
not been too loudly sounded.
The male tiuartet sang a pleading se
lection in closing, Dr. Plimpton sing
ing ah obligato solo. There then fol
lowed a time of social intercourse
when light refreshments were served
in the prayer meeting room. Rev.
Hamilton and wife cannot help from
being pleased at the cordial welcome

ARRESTED FOR SPEEDING
Otto Christensen Arrested Saturday
By Officer Burke And Taken Be
fore Mayor Laub.
Otto Christensen was arrested on
Saturday evening by officer M. J.
Burke for operatitfg his car faster
than the law permits .and was taken
before Mayor Laub, who fined liim $2.
The fciayor warned Mr. Christensen
that the next offense would draw a
much stiffor fine.
Residents in Denison are up in arms
over the fact that tho local offlcors
permit reckless driving, and speeding.
It is a well known fact that some dri
vers of machines are using the new
pavement for a speedway and go
pounding up and down the streets any
where from 20 to.50 miles per hour
endangering pedistriajis. Cars are
run with the cut outs wide open which
is strictly against the law. It is hoped
that the local officials will put a stop
to this kind of business and if neces
sary, fine those who are guilty of
breaking tlfe law.
REFUSES INJUNCTION
Judge Hutchison Refuses to Restrain
Hilton Bus Line From Using
"Hotel Denison" on Car.
Judge M. E. Hutchison.-of Lake City,
was in Denison Saturday holding an
adjourned session of court, at which
time a few minor matters were dis
posed of.
Mr. John Muir, who conducts the
bus and transfer line, brought injunc
tion proceedings against the Hilton
bus and transfer line to restrain them
from using the words "Hotel Deni
son" on their busses and this case was
tried before Judge Hutchison. It
seems that the Hfltons have painted
on their big auto bus the words "Hotel
Denison," and at the depots call out
that they carry passengers tb this ho

has not been desirous of having this
... bus line carry passengers to and from

by appearing upon the platform and
extending a welcome to the pastor's
