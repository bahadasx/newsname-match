SEEK LAW TO
A movement has been
smarted
among school authority
in Ihe coun
ty to cecure from the legifiaiure a
law to permit the county school levy
to be raised from 1 1-2 mills
to four mills to the end that district
school levies be greatly lowered or
eliminated.
Principal John B. Washburn of
the Milton-Freewater schools is at
the head of the movement and he . is
sending out circular letter to all his
patrons a-sklng that they Join in the
request to the legislature. Falling to
secure action from this body, the pro.
posal Is made that the matter be vot
ed upon direct by the people of the
county not latter than 1918.
Mr. Washburn points out that tne
taxpnyerg of his dislflct could
be

cnrnpnen to reduce your school tat

Tou now pay 10 mills district school

Mot of our school money Is raised

It bv county tnxa'lon. The county ft.

Coun'y taxation dlMrlhtites the burden
evenly. A 4-nilll county school tax
would support nil the schooli of the

stead of your present 11 1-2 mills dis

Our hlch tnx I" not due to our
spending too much money for schools.
Washington CHllforn'a nnd thirteen
other sta'es spend more per chill

In Oreeon spend more per child than
does our district. There nre onlv
few high schools In Oregon which
spend less per pupil thnn does ours.
Whnt we need is a fair distribution
of ihe tax burden.

town to be educated but do not bring
their farms along to be taxed by the
district which must provide schools
for their children Property is dis
tributed throughout the county, but
'he property owners to a great extent
live In the towns at least for the
winter. And so the towns have
the
Durden of educating almost all the
children of the county, but can tax
only that property which lies within
their district limits. How heavy the
burden thus placed upon the taxpay
ers of a few dls rlcts is shown by their
school levies last year; Hermlston,
12 mills: Umatilla, 10; Pendleton, 9;
Milton-Frejpwater, 9; Ferndale. 8;
Weston, 8; Athena. 8; Echo, 7; Pilot
Bock, 7; Stanfield. 7. Many of these
districts have still higher levlea this
year.
An effort will be made In the state
legislature this winter to pass a law
making the county the unit for school
taxation The law will provide for
raising through county taxation the
minimum amount needed to run the
schools with the strictest economy, al-J
lowing each district to raise by local'
tax any additional amount It wishes
to spetid. The law will go no fur
ther, and Is not to be confused with
the bill for making the county the
unit for school administration as well
as taxation which failed of passage
several years ago.
If we cannot secure this law from
the legislature, we can get the same
thing for Just our county by voting in
a special or general election In favor
of it. Our county commissioners
would then levy n 4-mlll county tax
to support the schools of the county.
We shall try to secure this equable
distribution of the school tax burden
first from the legislature, and if we
fnll there, then hy county election
Our success depends entirely upon the
nmount of support you will give us.
If you will put yourself on record ai '
Indorsing this movement you will help
It succeed. If you want to help, sign

SOPHOMORE PLAY
IS MUCH ENJOYED
Owing to the heavy fall of rain and
snow last evening, a sman croa wit
nessed the production of ine gopno
more" at the high school auditorium,
but thoe attending were well re
paid for their trouble. The produc
tion was a good one, there bein
much comedy displayed throughout
and every part being well taken.
The story, originally that of a col
lege town, was made over to fit the
local high school. Local character
izations were brought In, adding much
to the interest of the play.
Earl Snyder, playing the part of 8
star football player and hero of the
school, played his part to perfection
and won the admiration of the audi
ence. Also Frank Enbysk, playing
the part of football manager.
brought down the house bv his con-
tj,uial m0ck threats and comic action.
The parts of Ralph Hargett as foot
ball captain, Beta Ferguson and Hel
en Meengs as town gossips, Dewey
Oervals as the school dude and Ardis
Cuilison as a local football enihuiatst,
were also well taken.
The production, taken as a whole,
can be classed as one of the best
plays ever offered by the hlsh school.
Much credit must be given the char
acters and teachers for their untlrlnu
efforts In the practices nnd produc
tion. Another play will be given In th
near future by the same clnss that P"-.
on last night's production. The sam
prices thiit were offered last nlKh!

WASHINGTON, Dec. 20. Repre
sentative Anthony of Kansas, la
cross examining General Hugh Scott,
intimated the militia was kept on the
border for police duty for the pur
pose of causing disintegration. The
charge was made before the house

He asked, "Wouldn't such an oner,

the volunteer force?"
"Tea."
"If it was planned to cause the
downfall of the militia system, could
a better means be devised?"
Scott replied: "The border guard
is In the country's service for the
protection of lives."
Despite a terrific grilling, Scott re
mained firm In his sweeping denun
ciation of the militia system. He said:
"It is difficult to criticise the militia
system too severely. There Is noth

training.
