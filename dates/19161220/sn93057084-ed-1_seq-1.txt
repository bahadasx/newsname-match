CHRISTMAS GREETINGS
There are Christmas angels singing
The sweet swig of lone? ago,
Though wo only hear the ringing
Of the bells across the snow.
Though we do not. see the glory
O the shining angel throng?.,
Still wo cherish the sweet, story
That to Christmas Dav belongs.
Christmas was iirsfc celebrated
in tlie year 98. but it wa^ fortv
years later before' it was officially
adopted as a christian festival: nor
was it until ab'Mii ihe til'ili
ceuluiv
that the uay of ils celebration be
came pernanienlly tixed on the
twenty-fifth of December. Up to
that time it hail been irregularly
observed at vurio"u times of the
year—in December, in April and
in May, but most frequently in
•January.
Two notable coronations occur
cd (in Christina* day: that of (.'liar
lemagne, as emperor of the west,
in the year .800, and that of Wil
liam the Conqueror, at Westmin
ster Abbey, in 100 j. Clovis, the
first christian king of France, was
baptised on Christmas day, 4D!.
Gilles de Retz. of France, the
original "Blue Heard," was execut
ed on Christmas day, 1440, in
atonement for a multitude of
crimes, which included the. killing
of six wives, from which the pop
ular nursery story is derived.
The Pilgrims, who condemned
all church festivals, spent their
first Christmas in America work
ins hard all day long, amid cold
and stormy weather, and commen
ced the building of the first house
in Plymouth in 1620.
Sir Isaac Newton, whose grar,d
discovery of the law of gravitation
resulted from the simple fact of
liis seeing an apple fall to the.
ground, was born on Christmas
day, 1642.
In 1706 General Washington
celebrated the day hy performing
one of the most hazardous and
most brilliant maneuvers in the
aDnals of the war. Under cover
of the night he crossed the Dela
ware at McKonkey's Ferry, amid
the perils of storm and ice, and
marched his brave little army to
Trenton, where on the following
morning, he completely surprised
and routed the Hessians.
It is a significant fact that no
great battles were fought on Christ
mas day. They have occured on
the twenty-fourth and twenty sixth
of December, hut the anniversary
of the advent of Peace on Earth
has ever been observed hy cess
ation of hostilities. A notable ex
ception, however, is that of the
battle of Okeechobee, Fla., in
which Zaeharv Taylor defeated the
Indians in 1837.
On Christmas day in 1861 Presi
dent Lincoln and his cabinet met
and decided to comply with the
'demand of Great Britain for the
release of Mason and Slidell, who
had been cHptured while on their
way to England and France as
representatives of the confederacy.
