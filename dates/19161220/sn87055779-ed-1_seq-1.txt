LIFE HISTORY
DURING TRIAL
Mrs. Iva Barnes Accused of
Murdering Her Husband,
Tells of Early Life
in Mishawaka.
RESTAURANT MEETING
LED TO HER WEDDING
Takes Up Life With Barnes
and Pictures Suffering
As Result of Neglect
and Abuse.
International Neu a Sendee:
CHICAGO, Dec. 20. Nervous and
shaken as- a result of the ordeal,
Airs. Iva Harnes, charged with the
murder of her husband, James Ii
Harnes, today took the witness stand
and laid bare her life before the
jury wh'ch is trying her for her
life.
Previously Mrs. Harnes had heard
her sister, Mrs. II. InKersoll, and her
closest friend, Mrs. Louisa, Thomp
son, testify that her husband had
treated her cruelly and repulsed her
affectionate advances while they
were living ogether.
Mrs. Harnes collapsed shortly be
fore she was to take the stand, but
regained her composure and walk
ed bravely to the witness chair.
There, with face white as wax, and
a voice so low it scarcely reached
the Jurors, she began her story.
Tells of liirly I A to.
She told of her early life, of a
boy and ?irl marriage contracted
while she was very young, of being
divorced and of her work as a mil
liner in her home town of Misha
waka, Ind., and in South Hend, Ind.,
and later in Chicago. Then sho
rapidly sketched events until
romantic meeting which led to
marriage with Barnes.
It was in a restaurant where
tho
her
she
was
dining with a
man,
she said.
her escort left her for a moment
and Harnes, who was seated at a
nearby table, passed by and drop
ped, into her hand a card bearing
his name and telephone number.
She called him up he next day, she
said, met him on a street corner
later and thus began friendly rela
tions which culminated in their
marriage.
Mrs. Harnes next took up the
story of her life with Harnes, which,
as she pictured it. was years of
drinking, ill treatment and neglect
on his part and of love that made
allowances for many things on hers.
.Met Dandy Bartender.
Gradually she was led up to her
meeting with Kay iScheKheimer, the
dandy bartender whom she met in
a park and whose presence in her
home led to a separation from her
bucLard.
It was the part of her testimony
for which the spectators, jamming
every foot of the court room, had
been waiting impatiently.
At this point Mrs. Barnes was
overcome and sank from her chair,
unconscious. She was revived and
court adjourned for the noon day
recess. After being taken to the
matron's room, Mrs. Harnes again
ollapsed.

PROSECUTOR ASKS
DEATH PEILT!
Claims Teiper Actually Laugh
ed As He Walked From
the Cemetery.
International News Service:
KLTKALO, N. Y.. Dee. JO. The
death penalty for John Edward
Teiper, charged with killing his
aared mother, was demanded today

will."
The injuries to the prisoner,
which he alleged were received in

International ..News Service:
WASHINGTON. Dec. 2d. Con
gress is mired to the wheel hubs in
a, legislative bog. Despite the efforts
of the president and administration
leaders to avoid it. an extra session
appeared today the only alternative
to deliberately sidetracking much
of the legislative program, including
some of the white house recom
mendations. When congress recesses Friday
over the holidays it will have com
pleted one-third of this session. Xot
one important bill has been enacted
into law.
The preconvening conversations
of leaders about speeding up have
produced these net results:
Not One Forward .Step.

taken toward carrying out the pres

It teruatlonal News Serrlee:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 20. Hope
for continued negotiations between
allied central powers and the en
tente powers with a final peace as a
possibility if not a probability, was
expressed in diplomatic circles
here today. While neither Pres't
Wilson nor Sec'y of State Lansing
would discuHs the matter, it was
learned that the administration be
lieves the Lloyd-George reply to the
German peace proposal leaves the
way open for further peace discus
sion, with a fair prospect of suc
cess. This iew is likewise held by
representatives of the various neu
tral nations in Washington.
Washington diplomatists base
their hope on the paragraph of
Lloyd-George's speech which set
forth that the entente powers will
"wait till we hear what terms and
guarantees the German govern
ment offen?, better than those, surer
than those, which she so lightly
broke."
On authority close to the German
embassy, it was learned that Ger
many is fully prepared to lay before
the entente allies terms of peace
which will be more or less definite.
German diplomats, however, will
not at this time make a public state
ment of the details of her peace
terms.
They take the position that the
basis of settlement should be reach
ed in private discussion and not
through public diplomatic corres
pondence, characterized by all of
the bitterness of the pending con
flict. Germany's reply to the first com
ing entente note on the peace pro
posals is expected to suggest that
the terms of peaee be submitted to
a joint conference.

International News SerrW:
LONLON, Dec. 20. The program
of the new Lloyd-George war gov
ernment provides for a concentra
tion of authority that will enable
England to carry on the war more
vigorously than ever before. Ex
ecutive authority has been central
ized in a few hands and the men
who have control are selected for
their business and organizing abil
ity and not for political considera
tions. Shipping and mines are to be
controlled by the government in
order to provide the best results
and allay labor troubles.
A greater output of coal is
necessary and it Is believed that,
with shipping in government hands,
the food situation will be made
easier of solution as well as the sub
marine menace.
Warning is sounded against
"profiteering." or the raiding of
prices exorbitantly. All are re
quested to economize In food, the
premier asking all Britons to "pro
claim during the war a national
Lent."
The man power is to be utilized
to the limit. If the men do not en
roll voluntarily compulsion will be
put into effect.
Although no specific promises
were made, the premier said h
would strive to produce a better at
mosphere in Ireland. This is be
lieved to indicate that th- horn
rule question will be considered
along with th imperativ war
measures.

International New .verrtce:
LONTHJN, Dec. -n. The ontent
of the allied note to the central
powers rejecting the Teutonic peaeo
proposals will be along fh- wmi
lines as Premier Lloyd-George'
speech, it was stated in official cir
cles today. Specific terms are de
manded by the aJlies.
The big question of the hour now
is:
"Will Germany make new over-,
tures to the allies conveying terms
in accord with the broad principles
In Mr. Lloyd-George's speech?"
On this question thrc is a wide
division of opinion. It is felt that
the premier left the way open for
further negotiations, but whether
Germany will take advantage of
this opporturdty is a matter nt pur
speculation.
Every indication shows that Eng
land is preparing to wape war morn
vigorously than ever end the pro
pram laid down by th- premier
makes it plain that he does not look;
f.: an early cessation of hostilities..
The same view ir apparently main
tained by former Premier Arquith,
