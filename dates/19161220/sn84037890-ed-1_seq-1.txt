present, on all classes of property
Excepting deposits In bank, which
aro to bo taxed at 10 cents on eacli
$100 for the purpose of encouraging
thrift and savings and the circula
tion of money now sequestered bo
cause of excessive taxation. In oth
er respects taxation for State pur
poses will bo absolutely uniform on
all classes of property, whether own
ed by tho residents of towns or the

Apportionment of Uevenue The!

whether ownod by tho resident of a
town or the country for tho pur
poses for which It Is taxed.

Hollweg's peace speech offers us
much oncouragemont when consid

said (Jen. Frederick D. Maurice,
chief director of military operations
at th0 British War Office, on dh
cusslng today with tho Associated

Convention in St. Louis.
New York, Dec. 15. "Reincarna
tion" of tho Progressive party with a
"now sense of party Independence"
based upon "tho new liberal spirit,"
was agreed upon at a' conference of
prominent Progressives from sev
eral States held hero today.
Funds were subscribed to open a
national Progressive headquarters
In this city until the national con
vention meets In St. Louis. Permis
sion for "those leading Progressives
who have made party mistakes" to
re-enter tho party wero discussed,
but no actlo-i was taken.
Assurances also were given to
those who seemed to fear that tho
"reactionary group of Progressives''
might gain control of the St. Louis
convention, that only those known
to bo "loyal and true Progressives
who Had refused to go over to the
Republicans or Democrats," "would
have a voice in organizing the now

Tho conference, which was called
by Matthew Hale, of Boston, nation

party, lasted three bourn. Mr. Hale
was authorised to select a commlt

A resolution reaffirming tho Pro

THE BORDER SHIFT
Third Regiment to Patrol Front
.Most Serious Duty Yet,
Conditions Considered.
,E1 Paso, Tex., Dec. 1C. Early
this morning the Second and Third
Regiments of Kentucky's Infantry
w 11 leave their comfortable camp on
tl e mesa nertn of Fort Dlls and
btUln a lifteen-day tour of border
Pi.irol duty, the most serious work
they have as yet been called upon
to perform, as very unsettled condi
tions Ixlst just across the border and
largo bodies of armed Mexicans are
frequently seen by the American pa
trols. The two regiments will be carried
to their now camps in the big army
motor trucks, which have a capacity
of thirty men each. They will re
lieve the South Carolina regiment
and the First Kentucky, which will
return to their regular camps in the
trucks which take out tiio Second
and Third Kentucky. The First
Kentucky has been pati oiling the
border for a distance of fifty m!le3
below the city, a country which
abounds lit small game, and the sol
diers havo been feasting for the past
fifteen days on wild ducks, quail and
tabblts. So well did tho men of the
Fir3t like the patrol work that many
of them expressed a desiro to remain
t It for nnotlier fifteen-day period.
Ten Itory Assigned,
Tho Second will occupy tho sta
tions vacated by tjio (First, wihloh
extend from Kl Paso south to Fort
Hancock, a distance of fifty mile'.
Tho Third Kentucky will relievo tho
South Carolina regiment, which haa
been scatteied from tho city to Las
Cmces, N. M a distance of fifty
miles.
Owing to an outbreak of measles
aud mumps among the companies of
the South Carolina reglmont, sta
tioned at Las Cruces, C and M. Com
panies, of tho Third Kentucky, will
bo hold hero until tho quarantine on
tho South Carolinians Is raised.
In tho border patrol work the reg-
York and will bo back very soon.
Wo know If wo don't work out tho
situation ourselves, somebody Is go
ing to work it out for us In a way
not acceptable to cither side.
"Wo kuow that for twenty-flvo
years theso organizations havo dealt
across tho tnblo In a mout friendly
spirit, and I beliovo there Is suffic
ient Intelligence, on both sides of tho
tablo to enablo us to get together,
manlike, and thresh theso things out
aud reach a middlegrouud.''
Mr. Leo predicted that if tho pres
ent negotiations come to a success
ful ond tho disputes between rail
roads and omploycs will bo taken
out of politics by establishing somo
kind of a federal commission to tnko
tho placo of tho present board of
mediation and conciliation.
lmcnts aro broken up into companies
and located nt intervals along tho
border. Frequently the companies
nlso are broken up and smaller sta
tions established In order to give
protection to every point. Cavalry
stations arc nlso established and pa
trols along tho border made nightly.

"Congress will not agree to anv
repeal of the Adamson law," ho silil
tonight. "The measure was parted
in good faith and it is a constitu

roads and their men settle their
wage disputes.
"T hope that the negotiations bo
tween the railroads and their em

which will not make further legis

see that the public gets a fair deal.
If it becomes necessary to .spauk
