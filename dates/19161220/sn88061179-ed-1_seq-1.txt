would bediffereut,their patriot

ami the bO?t aud all the rest,
any?-"Nay, Nay, Uncle Sam
may go to lit'll ami g>'t h.sol?
diers where lie can ? I aril go?
ing home!"
This feeling is wellnigh uni?
versal with the men of Coin
puny 11. This Company is ire'-;,
garded as one of the best on
the. Monier. It won nut over
nil others in tho Seco ?I Regi?
ment iti the competitive drills
in August. Tho report for the
tests in October hue just been
published, and,again Company
II leads tho list. The oilier
i- impunies in the Regiment got
from one to us many as twelve
'?blUo marks", which mean de?
ficiency in the subject marked,
Company H was the only com?
pany without a single ('blue
mark" against it? -Company (i
of Petersburg came next with
only oim mark ami Company 1.
of Piiliiski third with only two
marks.
if tho spirit referred to pre?
vails in Company 11, one may
bo well assured thai it is oven
more prevalent in tho other
companies, and Htich is the
fact. They arc all, not only in
the Second Virginia, hut in all
thf Regiments on tin' Border,!
being rapidly reduced to mere
skeletons?None can now mus?
ter more than Bye or six squads,
and some not over foiu?and
recruit* have absolutely slopjted cam
ing,
Tho Regulars urn in equal or
greater trouble. Tlieyjhavia full
complements of officers, but
comparatively few unlisted
men. They hare been trying to
ilra if from the National (luurtl, but
Jew, very few, hare retpomlcd.
This is truly pitiful and, like?
wise, shameful and disgraceful.
To think of a great country of
over one hundred million pen
pic not being able to raise, for
emergency, an army of two hun?
dred thousand! It would he
unbelievable if it had not been
demonstrated beyond possibility
of dispute by tho past six
months of eirort. and failure.
But, for the shame and dis?
grace of it, the National Quart!
is in no manner responsible.
Neither is the Regular Arniy.
They have both done their duty
well. Wherein then does the
trouble lie?
lu my judgment tho follow
ing are the chief pauses:
Kirst?Dormant Patriotism.?I
am unwilling to believe that
the people of tlto United States
tire lacking in patriotism; but
there is no doubt that what
there is of it is fast asleep. We
need a good spanking from
Germany or England or Japan;
or, perhaps, who kuow>? We
may get it from even poor old
Mexico! Then, and not till then,
will we be aroused.
Second?Inadequate Pay,?'the
skilled laborer can mako at
home from three to six dollars'
a day?unskilled, from ono dol?
lar und fifty cents to three dol?
lars.
To suppose I hat thoso men
can be procured for (service in
the Army at fifty cents a day.
is Btupidilyj asinine, goose and
bull-moose all combined.
The service isVbarder, much
harder, than W. civihl life,
whether in peace or war. liar
der in pence, because more
monotonous, und because he
who enters here must say good
hv lo every vestige of personal
liberty ? lie must rtsu by the
bugle, eat by the bugle, drill,
shovel and ditch by the bugle,
and by it go to a dusty or mud?
dy bed. If he was bom with n
brain, he is unfortunate. The
enlisted man should leave it nt
liome when he joins the Army.
Harder in wnr, because war
maneuvers test strength mid
endurance to the limit, and be?
cause the danger of personal in?
jury is many-fold greater than
in civil life. The coal digger
makes from two to live dollars
a day. He is an unskilled laborer.
His high wages are paid as
compensation for the risk of
personal injury from slate falls
and the like. Why should n
soldier not receive like com?
pensation.
Third? The Gulf btttettn Officer*
mi'l Men.?Officers in the Army
and National dunnl uro con?
sidered "Gentlemen" and re?
ceive everywhere an such.They
attend the balls, hops, banquets
and other social functions, giv?
en by the elite in every com?
munity.
Enlisted men, on the other
hand, are "Men" not "Gentle?
men." They cannot eat with
an officer, or dance or piny or
sing with an officer or where an
officer is. The lady who re?
ceives or goes with an enlisted
man is blacklisted by ollicnrs' I
wives, daughters and female
friends. She must choose the
one or the other. Very few have
Buflicicnt standing and person?
ality to breach the custom and
i;o with both. The result is
t hat enlisted men, generally,are
debarred from female society,
except of tile lewd.
There are in the National
(lunrd many enlisted men who
(jo in the best society in their
home towns. To them the. ens
torn is galling beyond endur?
ance. Not only this, but they
tnliHt salute and stand at alien
tion whenever an officer speaks
to or approaches them. Effort
is made to teach them that this
is but the "friendly greeting'.'
of ''the free man" handed down
from Knight-errantry of the
Middle Ages. But the men
don't look at it in this way,
They regard it, call it what
you may, as a badge, a token,
an acknowledgment, of servili?
ty. The custom should be
abolished except when on ac?
tual duty.
Never will we ho able to get
real manhood in requisite mini
hers to voluntarily join the nrirty,
whether the Wcgnlnrs or the
National Guard, until we bridge
this gulf between officers and
enlisted men.
Thirty-five years ago 1 was
Captain of Company E(cnvrdry)
of Louisville Legion. There
was no such gulf in the Mililin
in those days. The enlisted
man danced nt the hops at the
Armory and at the encamp
ments along with the officers
anil officers' wives and dauch
ters and sweethearts. Hiiioehl
ilantlintf n? a soldier was the mime
a*, neither better nor wont than, hin
social ttandinq a.< a civilian. If.
ns the one, he was entitled to
dance with the belle of the ball,
so, as the ether) he danced with
the belle of tho ball, and vice
versa
Did it interfere with difcip
line? Not at all. On the con?
trary it made for good fellow?
ship and a loyalty between off!
cers and men which in non
existent under tho present
regime.
In conclusion, let mo say that
[unless the pay i? increased and
the gulf bridged, as abovn con
tended for, there is but one al-i
ternutive, and that is compulsory
service. The flay Bill is a dis?
mal failure. It should be re?
pealed and anothor enacted by
the present Congress. Either make
the service attractive or olse
force everyone alike to take his
share of the nausome dose.

By co-operative action on the
part of the Companies consti?
tuting the Bell Telephone Sys
tem, certain classes of their
employees throughout the Uni?
ted States will be aided in meet?
ing the unusuul conditions now
existing by an extra class pay?
ment, or payments, equivalent
to two or three week's salary
according to length of service.
Employees who have been in
the servfee for over one year,
[and who are receiving$3,000 or
less por year, will receive the
equivalent of three weeks' pay,
while those of the same class

Mine Rescue
Work.
Department Issues Report
MakingPleaForPrepared
ness Against Dis?
asters.
Washing-ton, Duo. 7.?A plea
for prepare Ines? at coal and
matal mines, so that if a dis?
aster comes and imprisons
many miners the oflicials may
have a definite plan for action
in saving life is outlined in a
report just issued by theBureau
of Mines of the Department of
the Interior and which is being
scut to practically all of the
mines in the United States. The
Bureau of Mines has aided in
rescue work at many mine ex?
plosions and has boon instru?
mental in saving the lives of
many men, but in almoBI every
instance where there has been
a great disaster the bureau's
oflicials they have found great
confusion prevailing with
much valuable time wasted bo
fort; a proper rescue orguniza
lion could bo effected. There
has also been a serious absence
ot the equipment necessary for
the recovery of the men on
tombed. Lack of such pro
parodnoss, the bureau says, no
doutit has often resulted in tin
necessary loss of lift- among tho
imprisoned men und also among
the rescue force
Since tho bureau began its
rescue weil; it has endeavored
in guide in the formation of
competent rescue organizations
at mine disasters, but has been
greatly hampered because of
the different methods in prac
tice in different parts of the
country. Based on its ? xperi
once at many mine disasters
the bureau has now formulated
a code which it is felt should
be in the hands of every re?
sponsible official at a mine
This code provides for an or?
ganization at each mine that
would become automatically
active the moment there is a
disaster, It also gives a list of
the necessary materials to have
on hand at all times ami out?
lines the most important duties
lor those organizations during
such emergencies.
"At times there lias boon
some little misunderstanding
as to just what part the Bureau
of .Mines is expected to take in
rt seile work," said Van 11.
Manning, director of the
bureau.
'?This manual is Intended to
define the duties of tho roscuros
anil to bring about a bettor tin
deratanding between the moo
engaged in rescue work us to
the functions of tho bureau. It
lias been a popular notion that
the rescuers of the bureau,
wearing heavy oxygen rescue
apparatus, should carry the
tload from the mine, and there
has been some little disappoint
moot at the refusal of the res?
cuers to.take part in this work.
It has been my policy that the
rescuers should seek to save
live men und give thorn assist?
ance, and should not be called
upon except in special emer?
gencies to carry bodies, and
then only for a short distance.
"The entiro strength of tho
men, thus hatulicupped by tho
heavy apparatus, should bo ex?
pended in saviug iife.
"Disasters do not come fre?
quently to individual mines,
[and there has been a natural
feeling that thoy will never
come. Consequently very littlo
thought ie given to what should
bo done when such a catastro?
phe does come. The result has
been very little preparedue8<)
and considerable confusion, es
p 'cinlly when some of the best
men in tbo employ of tbo com?
pany are imprisoned or killed.
The manual is intended to give
the oporntors and superinten?
dents and other olllcials of the
mines some idea of the charact?
er of organization that should
be normally in force ni a mine
every dny it is working, and
explain bow ibis organization
may bo turned into an effective
rescue force when n disaster
comes. It is an effort ou the
part of tbo bureau to save the
possible number of men im?
prisoned in a mine and at the
same time to safeguard tbo lives
of the rescuers, ninny of whom
have been sucriflood in|ihe past.
The bureau docs not liko to
think of disasters happening; at
the same time it believes in pre?
paredness when they do come.
If the suggestions in this ar?
ticle succeed in saving the lifo
of a single miner the bureau
will be repaid for its efforts
along this line."
