WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec 20.
The way was cleared yesterday for
legislative action today in the senate
on the bill providing prohibition in
the District of Columbia. T he amend
ment proposed by Senator Underwood
providing that the subject of DrohibI
tion be referred to a vote of .the peo
ple was lost on a lie vote.
By C. Z. ALBERT
(Sperial Star-Bulletin Corrrnpondence)
WASHINGTON. D. C. Dec. 10. The
fight for prohibition in Hawaii and
the District of Columbia started off
"like a house afire." The major move-1
1 ment got under way before Congress
was a week old.- In fact it seemed
difficult to restrain the advance guard
until the opening day and the presi
dent's address were out of the way.
The fifth day of the session' saw the
senate buisly engaged in discussing al
forms of i wetness and dryness.
It is self-evident there will be nc
let-up in the fight until March 4.
There must either be legislation or a
fod reason for postponing it. Notice
ipady has been served on the' house
wtt If a fair and square record rote is
refused by the leaders over there pro
hibition will be offered as an amend
ment to the District of Columbia ap
propriation bllL
It is accepted as certain that pro
hibition will prevail, so far as this city
and Hawaii are concerned, if a decis
ive vote is reached. For that reason
the opponents will devote all of theli
' energies to preventing such a vote.
arious plans already are under con-
Eideration. The referendum Is the one
most highly favored. It is urged that
the citizenship of the affected terri
tory be allowed to express their pref-
crences in the matter. This at least!
wxuld mean delay. Senator Under
wood is strongly urging that this be
done. .
Senator Sheppard, as heretofore, is
leading the fight for prohibition.. He
is determined to win if possible at this
session. In such an event he will
bring up next year the struggle for
nation-wide legislation to eliminate
mm. He believes the capital city and
Hawaii can be made dry before the:
4th of March rolls around. All those!
who think the same way are standing
' right behind him.
Present Indications are that the
fight will be a pretty and lively one.
It will rage up and down during the
nsuing three months. Whenever an
opportunity is presented the subject
will be brought forth for discussion.
Whenever there is a lull pressure will
te brought to have a decisive vote
taken. . ., . .;

general of San Francisco, who is on
trial here -for criminal conspiracy in
so-callel "bomb piots."
The first witness for the defense
today. Vice-Consul E. II. von Schack,
said that Germany had ordered him
t ) get information as to the munition
shipments of the Entente ' powers,

the story told by her husband expos
ing the details cf the alleged conspira

ing she was permitted to tell her

REGRETS ALLIES
PEACE PROPOSAL
Dr. Charles F. Dole Says Any
Such Suggestion Demands
Hearing From Belligerents
"It is a pity the Allies, for the sake
of humanity, did not take more seri
ously than they apparently have the
Central Powers' peace proposal. It is
high time such a disastrous, futile war
were stopped."
This is one of several forceful ex
pressions to the Star-Bulletin today
from Dr. Charles F.. Dole, the distin
guished author-educator, who arrived
in the Wilhelmina with Mrs. Dole to
visit their son, James ;D. Dole, here.
As a pacifist of enown the doctor
was deeply disappointed that England
and her allies have so completely dis
rmrAaA rLai-m r n v'a sfpn ar the nress
despatches of yesterday indicated.
"The least ; the Allies migni nae
ilnnp" he savs. "would have been to
ask Germany what she had to propose.
Instead, they apparently did' not try to
make inquiries into the nature of
peace arrangements.
Mr. Dole says further that the
slightest indication of peace, from no
matter what source or for what rea
son, should command the earnest at
tention of all belligerents in such an
awful, impossible struggle.
Nearer the Middle
"Final peace plans will probably be
nearer the middle with less advan
tages on either side than either one
cf the fighting factions are now will
ing to admit," was his opinion of final
arrangements.
The doctor took a polite knock at
the United States before leaving the
peace discussion by saying it was too
bad this country did not lead all otner
neutrals in a demand for .peace and
the encouragement of any proposals.
"I believe the whole world will now
think from our passlveness after Ger
many's proposals," he says, "that the
United States is not at all anxious for
the war to stop. We should correct
that impression." -
