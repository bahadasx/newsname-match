CHAIRMAN POLING
DELIVERS KEYNOTE
ADDRESS FOR DRYS
Arraigns Democrats and Republicans
for Alleged Extravagant Use
of Funds.
SAYS PROHIBITIONISTS
NOW SOLE PROGRESSIVES
Assails Campaign of Militaristic Pre-
paredness Names Party
"Liberal."
(By United Press)
St Paul, Minn, July 19"The
call of the hour is the challenge of
a supreme opportunity, to an unpar
alleled sacrifice These are the words
of triumphpeace, prosperity, pro
hibition Elect prohibition Write
woman into the Constitution Turn
out the exploiters of the people Take
private profit from war Stop the
slaughter of peace Save America
and serve the world
In these words Temporary Chair
man Daniel A Poling concluded his
keynote address at the outset of the
Prohibition national convention
which convened here this morning.
Represent Progressivism.
Mr Poling, declaring that the Pro
hibition party was now the sole rep
resentative of progressivism in na
tional politics, extended an official
and hearty invitation to the 4,000,-
000 voters who supported the Pro
gressive party ticket in 1912, and
suggested that whatever the techni
cal name of his own party should be
upon the official ballot this year, it
would be known henceforth as the
Liberal Party of the United States.
Expressing the evidently over
whelming sentiment of the conven
tion, Chairman Poling^ assailed the
campaign of militaristic prepared
ness, arraigned the Republican and
Democrat parties alike for what he
alleged to be an extravagant waste of
national funds, eulogized Jane Ad
dams, attacked at length the activi
ties of the Navy League, and after
advocating unequivocal loyalty to the
Monroe Doctrine, the establishment
of a world court of arbitration, in
ternational reciprocity of trade, radi
cal reform in the treatment of im
migrants, the development of a na
tional program for the constructive
use of the United States army in
time of peace, and the immediate en
actment by federal statute and
amendment of woman's suffrage and
various social reforms, he concluded
his plea with the dictum that "Pro
hibition spells Preparedness," and
that the hour had come to change the
popular slogan among temperance
forces of "National Prohibition in
1920" to the campaign battle cry "A
National Prohibition President in
1916
"The High Covenant."
In summing up his outline of the
party's prospective campaign, which
calls for a whirlwind campaign back
ed by a million dollar war fund, with
two million homes reached directly
with Prohibition argument before
November 7, Mr Poling detailed as
the nucleus for the party's national
declaration this year the following,
which he termed "The High Coven-
ant:"
"To the people of this nation we
pledge ourselves to begin immediately
on election to power an authorized
campaign to establish a world court
and we further pledge that we will
move at once to secure reciprocal
trade arrangements with the coun
tries from whom we purchase and to
whom we sell.
"We will proclaim our constructive
program to secure the practical
brotherhood of the nations. And as
we move to stop the slaughter of
war, remembering the unnumbered
dead, the unnumbered living and the
unnumbered unborn cursed by alco
hol, we will immediately deprive the
liquor traffic of the use of the mails,
take from it the protection of inter
state commerce, place upon it a pro
hibitive tax, move to accomplish a
prohibition amendment to the Con
stitutionand thus we will stop the
greater slaughter of peace.
Prohibition Convention
Is Opened in St. Paul
To Fortify Nation.
"We^iledge ourselves to fortify the
nation, to make her a citadel impreg
nable, but to conserve her human and
natural resources with every dollar
that builds her army and her fleet
We covenant with the people to take
private profit out of war, and to pun
ish the traitors who placed rotten
armor between our country's defend
ers and their foes. And we solemnly
swear to make our preparation, a pre-

paration for peace, harmonized to
every ideal of the Democracy whose
message must not fail, for it is the
hope message of the world. And we
will not forget that Prohibition spells
Preparedness.
"We go forth to champion the un
restricted political rights of woman
hood and demanding an ample justice
for little children. And in every ef
fort made for social justice we will
remember that the supreme tangible
foe of motherhood, her most bitter
enemy when she asks for the ballot,
and the Judas Iscariot of her sons
and daughters, is King Alcohol
FIGHT CERTAIN ON
SEVERAL PLANES OF
PROHIBITION PARTY
St Paul, Minn., July 19 Twelve
hundred and fifty-four delegates to
the national Prohibition convention
today got down to the business of
nominating a presidential candidate
that is certain to be beaten in the
presidential election this fall.
For a brief moment or two this
summer Prohibition leaders seriously
hoped to actually elect a Prohibition
ist for president of the United States
That was right after the Democratic,
Republican and Progressive parties
declined to put satisfactory suffrage
planks in their platforms. It was at
that time, too, that the Moose still
showed some signs of life.
Drys Cease Hoping.
But when Roosevelt put a definite
kibosh on the Moose, and the hy
phenated vote endorsed Hughes, Pro
hibitionists ceased hoping The hy
phenated vote is solid against them.
The 4,400,000 women voters, they
realize, could hardly swing the na
tion to them, even though these fair
er voters stood by their pledge to
amalgamate with the political party
showing them a satisfactory suffrage
plank.
The Prohibition plank on this is
sue, it became well known today, will
be satisfactory. Universal equal suf
frage has been a part of the party's
creed since 1872 and will continue
to be demanded.
19 States axe Dry.
And so it developed that today's
session was the first of a three days'
routine of rejoicing over the fact that
19 states have adopted state-wide
prohibition and that 65 per cent of
the United States is dry. Of course
a platform will be adopted, just like
all other parties must have a plat
form, and it was on this structure
that the political carpenters started
real work today.
Prohibition forms the chief plank
in the platform. But it is not the
only one for the Prohibition party
claims to be pioneers of social reform
planks, postal reform planks, direct
vote reforms and conservation planks.
When the builders of the platform
started work today it appeared cer
tain that there would be fights over
the adoption of several of the planks.

water.
So much water was used during
the day yesterday, sprinkling lawns,
etc., that the water tank was empty
last night at six o'clock and no wa
ter was available. It is believed that
over 100,000 gallons of water was
used yesterday.
Sprinkle in Evening.
Several water consumers have
made it a practice to keep their water
springier sprinkling their yards dur
ing the entire day. These people are
requested not to do this. The proper
time to sprinkle the yard is early in
the morning or in the evening. A
small sprinkling at these times will
do more good than if the sprinkler
is allowed to operate during the en
tire day.
George Kirk, clerk of the water
board, today requested the Pioneer to
publish the following notice:
Notice to Water Consumers.
"During this hot spell I would re
spectfully request every water con
sumer to be carefull and waste no
water. Also would request them not
to use their hose on the lawns dur
ing the day. Our tank was empty
last night at 6 o'clock, owing to ex
cessive use of water during the day."

Washington, D- C, July 19The

buster Piebident Wilson demands
that the measure be passed before his
campaign is started
President Wilson made a personal
visit to the capitol yesterday to em
phasize his desire that a child labor
law be put on the statute books of
the present session of congress. To
senate leaders whom he summoned
to a series of conferences in the
president's chamber adjoining the
senate chamber, he said the child la
bor bill passed by the houfaershould
be made a part of the legislative pro
gram to be put through the senate
before adjournment.
Determined opposition by southern
senators forced the house bill which
would prevent shipment of interstate
commerce of goods manufactured
wholly or in part by children, out of
the imperative program drawn up by
the Democratic caucus last Friday It
was left in a secondary position to be
considered only if time remained
after other measures recorded as more
urgent had been disposed of.
Mr Wilson had. been told that an
effort to force its passage would mean
a serious party revolt
FILM PLAY MAKES
PLEA FOR DEFENSE
"The Battle Cry of Peace," a film
drama by Stuart Blackton, which
will be shown at the Grand theater
Thursday and Friday, is frankly a
propaganda play for preparation and
as such it *s always earnest, always
persistent and at times decidedly elo
quent.
Heywood Brown the New York
Tribune says in regard to the play:
"There are thrills by the yard,
horrors slowly drawn out inch by
inch and not a few feet of good com
edy The achievements of the cam
era are remarkable Enormous crowds
are employed the scenes of panic
and big masses of troops pictured as
they charge in the face of shrapnel.
The agony is piled on in a fearless
fashion But if the success of the
campaign for preparedness rests up
on scaring people into a rehazation
of the needs of defenses we can
stand any horrors pictured for a good
cause Preparation may keep our
horrors on the screen
THE BATH HOUSES.
Reports were received by the
Pioneer this afternoon that
charges are being made for the
use of the bath houses construct
ed by the city at Diamond Point.
If this is a fact, city officials
should take immediate steps to
see that the practice is stopped.
The city council at a recent
meeting voted $100 for the con
struction of the houses. A. A.
Carter was given the concession
to sell confectionery, pop, ice
cream, cigars, etc at a stand* at
the point and to charge for
bathing suits, towels and for
checking articles, according to
several aldermen this afternoon.
Other aldermen say that Mr.
Carter was given the privilege
to charge for the bath houses.
In return for these privileges
Mr -Carter was named special po
lice officer to have charge of the
bath houses Mr Carter also su
perintended the construction of
the houses.
The charging for the use of
the bath houses is wrong. The
city paid $100 for the construc
tion of the houses and they
should be open to the public
