No Change in (he R. R. Situation.
We had hoped by this issue to report
that the rights of way for the railroad
had been secured, but they have not,
and the situation is about the same as
reported last week. If the farmers in
Adair, Green and Taylor want a road
they must give the right of way, that
is those who own lands the road would
pass over. That is all that-is lacking.
The 850,000 bonus is up. The farming
element would be benefitted more
than any other class of men, and they
should show their anxiety by giving
rights of way. Do this and the road,
in our judgment, is secured.
Prof. Reed Shelton has accepted a
chair in the Presbyterian College,
Maryville, Tenn , for the coming school
year.
An Ode to Talc.
The following lines were written bj
Miss Nell Naylor, of Oklahoma, who
is visiting her relatives in Columbia
and vicinity. The subject was given
her at a picnic on the lawn of Mr. A
G. Todd, a few afternoons ago, and
she only had 5 minutes in which to
write it. A premium was offered for
the best verses in the time allotted,
and Miss Naylor won it, there being a
number of contestants:
"When the day is hot and sunny and
your complexion begins to fade,
Just take a box of Williams and touch
ib up a shade
It's made in Connecticut, and sent out
by mail,
If you have none in your house get
some without fail.
Now don't think for once that it's only
used on faces.
For often to make biscuits it is used
in places.
It is splendid they say for cleaning
white shoes,
And for toothpasts too, it has been
often used.
Don't worry-about it's goodness, the
pure food law makes it so.
Now, if you have none on hands at
once to the drug store go.
"Broken Coin" to-night, more thrill

A Reunion.
Princeton, Cal. June 6, 1916 The
three Ross families held a family re
union Sunday at the home of Ed Ross
south of Princeton, the only absent
member was Oliver Ross, who is at
Hobart Mills, near Truckee. All of
the members of these families are na
tives of the State of Kentucky and
their hearts ever turn to the blue
grass land and the magnolia trees.
The day was spent with music, feast
ing and in happy reminiscence of the
old Kentucky home. The families,
and they are all of Ed Ross' near rel
atives, are Will Ross and wife with
their three sons, Richard, Ray and
Joseph; Vanis Ross, wife and son,
Leon; Ed Ross and wife, and sons, Ol
iver and Dewey, and daughters, Liz
zie and Helen. From a California pa

An Enjoyable Affair
An occasion that will long be re
membered was the ice cream supper
given by the local camp of Modern
Woodmen, at Cane Valley, last Satur
day evening. Something like one nun
dred and fifty attended, the gathering,
it being upon Mr. Leslie Tupman's lawn
wnich was brilliantly lighted, a beau
tiful sight to the onlooker. During
the evening the Cane Valley Brass
Band discoursed enchanting music to
the delight of the lassies and beaux,
who were cozily seated on divans,
chairs, etc., throughout the lawn.
Cane Valley Camp did itself proud,
and all who attended sounded praises
of its hospitality and the friendly
handshakes with visiting member's as
they appeared upon the grounds' Six
members of Columbia Camp were
present: L. W. Staples, G. C. Garri
son, F. A. Rosenbaum, J. C. Strange,

A Judge, an elegant gentleman,
who has never passed upon stock at
Columbia Fair, has been secured for
the coming exhibition, August 15.
flow Helm Has "Upheld the
Hands of the President."
An inspection of the Congressional
Record shows that Mr. Helm deserted
the Piesident and the Democratic ma
jority of Congress upon several of the
most vital matters which have been
before Congress in recent years, mat
ters which were salient features of
the Democratic platform and the
enactment of which has received the
almost unanimous approval and com
mendation of the people of the nation.
Congressman Helm claims to have
"endeavored to consistently uphold
the hands of the President."
When the great Banking and Cur
rency act was passed: the act which
established Federal Reserve Banks
and did more to place the tlnancial
: system of this country upon a firm
substantial and permanent basis than
all other currency legislation within
half a century, where was the vote of
the present Congressman from the
Eighth district?
The roll call shows that Mr. Helm
DID'NOT VOTE upon this bill. Ev
ery other Democrat from Kentucky
voted for the bill except Cantrill, who,
also is recorded as not voting upon it.
When the Immigration bill, design
ed to exclude a great many illiterate
and undesirable foreigners from mak
ing America a breeding place and asy
lum for crime, was up for passage in
the House, where was Mr. Helm's
vote upon this big measure, advocated
by the President?
The record shows that Mr. Helm
DID NOT VOTE on this bill. Every
other Democrat from Kentucky voted
for it except Sherley, of Louisville,
where there is a large foreign popula
tion, and who voted against it.
When the bill to repeal a provision
of the Panama Canal Tolls act ex
empting vessels engaged in coastwise
trade of the U. S., from tolls through
the canal was up, and vigorously
urged for passage by President Wo.od
row Wilson, where was Mr. Helm's
vote?
Every Democratic congressman from
Kentucky except Helm voted for the
bill- The record shows the congress
men from Kentucky who voted against
this bill, earnestly desired by the Pres
ident to have been:
HELM, Democrat.
LANGLEY, Republican.
POWERS, Republican.
And again. When the Anti-Trust
bill, in two acts, was before the
house and this was one of the very
fundamental features of the Dem
ocratic platform and campaign for
victory in 1912 where was the vote of
Mr. Helm, who says' he desires to "con
sistently uphold the hands of the
President?
On both Anti-Trust bills, Mr. Har
vey Helm, Of the Eighth Kentucky
district, is recorded in the official rec
ord, as NOT VOTING.
To say the least, the present Con
gressman from this district seems to
have adopted a most unusual and re
markable method of "consistently up
holding the hands of the President."
By his votes upon these measures
which the Presideut and the Dem
ocratic majority of both Houses of
Congress believed of intense and par
amount importance to the country
that tliey enacted into law, it might
almost be said in the language of the
immortal Ollie James, in talking of a
certain "statesman," who deserted
the President and the majority of his
party at a crucial hour: "Yes; he up
held the hands of the President; held
them up so that his enemies might
tie them."
Think this over, Mr. Democratic
Voter, when the primary election rolls
around on August 5th. Do you be
lieve in continuing in office a congress
man who "upholds the hands of the
President" fn such fashion? Adv.

Died in Dallas, Texas.
News has just been received here of
the death of Mr. Leslie Powell, aged
43 years, which occurred in Dallas,
Texas, Friday, the 7th of July The
immediate cause of his death was
paralysis of the brain. During last
winter he had a severe attack of la
grippe from which he never fully re
covered The deceased was a son of Andrew
and Laura Powell and was born on
Gleusfork, near Glenville, this county.
He came to Columbia with his par
ents aoon after he reached the school
age, and lived here until his mother
removed to Texas, about nine years
ago.
He was a young man of excellent
character, and a short time after he
reached his majority he was admitted
lo the Co umbia bar.
The intelligence of his demise vas
received with profound sorrow through
out this community.
The News and all Columbia tender
condolence to the surviving sisters,
his parents being dead, and all other
relatives
Make up your mind to see the many
stables of fine slock which will be ex

Heed this Notice.
There is a city ordinance prohibit
ing the throwing of slop, old cans and
other rubbish upon the streets and al
leys of the town of Columbia, and it
should be strictly .obeyed. It is the
desire of the municipal board to put
this town in a good sanitary condition,
but it can not be done unless the resi
dents of Columbia co-operate with
those in authority. Pestilence might
come, and should it visit this commu
nity, it could be checked much easier
if the town is clean than otherwise.
Every town in Kentucky is taking pro
caution against disease, and this place
should stand in line with those who
are making an effort to protect human
life. Now is the time to act. Get
busy. The Board is now having the
weeds mowed along all the sidewalks
in the city, which make the streets
more attractive. This work will be
continued until all the sidewalks will
be cleared of all kinds of obnoxious
growth.
The premium list of the Columbia
Fair, which will open Tuesday, Au

ing about the separation. Last Sat

Declined to Take Advantage of
Clements.
Rather than take an advantage of
his opponent and secure a nomination
that he regarded would be clouded,
under the circumstances, the late
Judge James Garnett, of Adair coun
ty, father of James Garnett, former
Attorney General of Kentucky, who
is now engaged in the practice of law
in Louisville, forfeited the prize which
could have been his and saw it go to
the oue who opposed him
Judge Garnett; who was the Circuit
Judge of the old Seventh district from
1874 to 1330, iu the latter year ran for
re-election and was opposed for the
Democratic renomination bv .Judge
Joseph Lewis, of Glasgow. The dis
trict convention 'was called to be held
at Edmonton, Metcalfe county. The
returns from the county conventions
indicated that Judge Lewis had car
ried the district by a small majority,
but when the time for the Edmonton
convention arrived it was found that
the heavy rains had so swollen the
streams in that section that a great
many of the Lewis delegates could not
reach Edmonton to take part in the
convention.
This left Judge Garnett and his sup
porters masters of the situation, and
Judge Garnett was ur?ed to go on and
organize the convention and have him
self nominated, it being pointed out to
him that he was not responsible for
the floods and the failure of the Lewis
delegates to attend.
Judge Garnett, however, would not
listen to this, and h.e insisted that an
adjournment be taken until the fol
lowing day. so that all the delegates
could participate. He knew that by
his action the nomination would go to
Judge Lewis, who was nominated and
elected and afterwards elevated to the
Court of Appeals bench
Got His Political and Religious
Wires Crossed.
-The late Gov. James R. Hindman,
of Adair county, who was known all
over the State, once got his polities
mixed with his religion under novel
circumstances, and tlte incident is
often referred to in Methodist gather
ings. 'It was in 1802, just after he had
been nominated as the Democratic can
didate for Congress in the Eleventh
district at the Loudon convention,
that Gov. Hindman, who was a zeal
ous Methodist and active worker in the
denomination, went to Campbellsville
to attend the Louisville Conference of
the Methodist Episcopal Church South
as a delegate. When he got there the
subject under discussion was the
"Lack of Spirituality in the Church."
Gov. Hindman promptly took part in
the discussion, ending up with:
"Brethren, I want to say to you that
spirituality is the bedrock of Democ
racy, ana tnererore we nave goo to
have more of it in the Methodist
Church
While Gov. Hindman's clear-cut
declaration created a commotion in
the Conference, the- members, know
ing that he had come direct from an
(enthusiastic Democratic gathering and
1 was filled with an exuberance of party
spirit, charitably overlooked his re
marks when he got his political aad
religious wires crossed.
Although he made a gallant race in
that Republican stronghold, Gov.
Hindman was not elected to Congress.
In 1897 he was the nominee of the
'Sound Money" Democratic party for
office of Clerk of the Court of Appeals.
