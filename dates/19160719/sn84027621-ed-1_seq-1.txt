Wednesday, July 26, When the Votes
for the Library are .
Counted
From the way the organizations are
fighting for ballots in the great li
brary contest, Wednesday, July 2Gth,
promises to be a big day in' Ocala.
The great library contest which has
been running in Ocala for fifteen
weeks, closes Saturday, July 22nd,
promptly at 9 o'clock p. m.
No ballots will be alowed to be plac
ed In the ballot box which is located at
the Court Pharmacy after 9 o'clock,
Saturday, July 22nd. There will be
extra provisions made for the ballots
which undoubtedly the ballot box will
not hold. 1
We feel quite safe in saying that
many hundred thousands of .ballots
have been held in reserve and will not
be cast until the closing hours of the
contest. 'V'
, The great question today is which
of the leading contestants is going to
win. All members of the different or
ganizations and their friends will be
very busy Saturday purchasing goods
and paying their accounts at the dif
ferent places of business and doing
everything possible to obtain votes as
several of them are so close in the
race that it will be impossible to tell
who has won until every ballot is
counted.
Watch next Wednesday's Evening
Star and the Weekly Star of the 28th,
which will tell you what organization
is the winner.

Joplin, ftjo., July 19. Four men
who havevbeen imprisoned Jn the Bab

alice this, morning.
BADLY BURNED
Two Firemen and a Member of Com
pany A Suffered from an Ac
cident this Morning
, Louis Keef e, captain of the fire de
partment, was seriously and painful
ly burned about his body and on his
army and legs, and Guy Driggers, an
other fireman, had his hands and arms
burned, when the bottomof a gaso
line blow torch blew out in the work
shop of the fire station this morning
about 10 o'clock. George Williams, of
Company A, Second.. Regiment, N. G.
F.; on a furlough of several days, had
the 'fingers of both hands burned in
assisting with pulling the flaming
clothing off of Captain Keefe.
Captain Keefe and Driggers were
soldering a" part of one motor fire-
fighting machines. The two men were
doing the soldering on a work bench
and were leaning against 'the bench
w hen the blow torch L burst, Captain
Keefe receiving the brunt of the flam
ing gas against his abdomen, Drig
gers getting the flames on his hands
and arms. v
Immediately the explosion had oc
curred, Captain Keefe rushed out of
the work shop to the porch in the rear
of the fire station, leaped off the
porch into the yard and ran into the
flower garden. Driggers rushed to
Captain Keefe's assistance, but his
burned hands made him helpless. By
this time, George London, a negro,
appeared at the rear of the pressing
club next to the fire station. London
came up as Captain Keefe got caught
on the garden fence. The negro jerk
ed Captain Keefe's blazing shirt off,
and picked the fireman up and threw
him over the fence into the grass.
Menvhad hurried from the fire sta
tion, City Clerk Sistrunk from the
city hall, and others from the Star of
fice and Temple theater, to the assist
ance of Keefe. They pulled off his
clothes as quickly as possible, and put
out the fire. Keefe was all this time
suffering intensely. George Williams
burned his hands, and 'H. R. Clayton
was slightly burned in pulling off the
burning clothes.
Soda was applied to the burns of
Captain Keefe and seemd to increase
the intensity of the pain. He was
taken into the fire station and phy
sicians called. Keefe and Driggers
were then placed in automobiles and
hurried to the hospital.
, Driggers wounds were dressed and
be returned to thefire station dormi
tory. The wounds of George Will
iams were dressed at Gerig's drug
store. . . - .
1 Chief Chambers of the fire depart
ment had his right hand burned, and
City Clerk Sistrunk had his arm sing
ed in assisting Keefe.
Driggers left this af ternon for
Oklawaha, to be with his mother for
several days. '
At 3:15 o'clock this afternoon Cap
tain Keefe was renting easily. The
burns were said to be very serious.
Just how serious could not be deter
mined yet, it was said. .

Charles Cullen Has Incurred an In

:Does Not Appreciate
(Associated Press)
London, July 19. Charles Cullen of
Ocala, Fla., is included in the list of
Americans blacklisted under the trad
ing with the enemy act.
-" " -::::l--;Vi:;,v "v- .;; v
Mr. Cullen was interviewed by the
Star regarding this international
honor thrust upon him immediately
after the above dispatch came in. Mr.
Cullen says that he has been for
years and is yet the Ocala represen
tative of a large . phosphate dealing
firm in Germany. He has never had
and- business relations with England,
and should therefore not be affected.
Mr. Cullen is an Englishman, and
came here about twenty years ago. He
has however heen a citizen of ' the
United States for several years. The
Star has been in communication with
him almost every day since the war
began, and has noticed "that while he
did not show any bitterness toward
Germany that his sympathy with his
native country was too marked to be
doubted. ,
All the firms put by the British
government on the black list are
American firms 'and have a perfect
legal and ; moral right to trade- with
Germany or any other country.
. At 3:30 the Star received a request
from the New York World for a two
hundred word story regarding Mr.
Cullen. -

Western Union Makes It Easy to
Wire Money to the "Boys" '

The Western Union Telegraph com
pany announces that until further no
tice it will make telegraphic transfer
of money to members of the National
Guard who have been mustered into
the federal service at the Mexican
border at one-half the usual charges
for such service. Relatives and friends
will doubtless be interested to learn
of this arrangement, whereby much
appreciated ; funds can be quickly
transferred by . telegraph at a low
cost. The proposition is the more at
tractive from the fact that messages
of affection, cheer, etc., may be incor
porated in the transfer at a small ad
ditional charge for the extra words
involved.

11LDII THE LIGHT
That the city has already lost at
least $15,000 because of the blocking
of the construction of the new light
and water plant, is the advice given by
the engineers, according to the ans
wer of the city to the bill of complaint
just filed by those who would cause
further delay.
The council adjourned at a late
hours last night to meet again this
afternoon at 4 o'clock for the pur
pose of considering the city's answer
to the bill of complaint filed by the
applicants for the injunction to . re
strain the city from making any.pay
ment to the contractor for the light
and water plant. Immediately follow
ing the notice given on Saturday of
the intention to ask for an injunc
tion, Frederick Hocker, city attorney,
went to work on the answer. He dic
tated it yesterday afternoon, and last
night asked that the council meet
this afternoon to hear the answer
read, in orderthat every member of
the body mighty swear to and sign
the same.
The answer dictated by the city at
torney is voluminous, as is the bill of
complaint. That the city council is
acting without its rights in the con
struction of a combined light and wa
ter plant is denied. It is pointed out
that the 1911 ordinance, gives the city
the option of either purchasing and
equipping a water works already in
operation, or of constructing and
equipping a new water works. A com
bined water and light plantwas rec
ommended by the engineers, who urg
ed it because of economy. In build
ing the combined plant all water works
items and all electric light' items are
kept separate, the answerof the city
sets forth, and "there is no indiscrimi
nate commingling or mixing of
charges." It is pointed out that the
cost of the water works portion of the
combined plant will -not exceed the
funds available for water works pur
poses, and that the cost of the elec
tric light portion will not exceed the
funds for electric light purposes.
The electric light bond ordinance
specifically states that the funds are
to be used for a paint in connection
with the water works.
The answer states that the city has
been advised by its engineers that the
plant now under construction will cost
at least $15,000 more than it would
have cost had the city been allowed
to construct the plant at the time first
intended. Further delay will cost the
city more money. '
Tomorrow at 9 o'clock is the time
set by the complaintants for making
application to Judge Bullock for the
injunction. . 4

Considerable Dispute About Plumbing
at Last Night's Meeting of
'';-".' .the Council i-'f. ...
The new plumbing ordinance, pass
ed by council at its meeting two weeks
ago, has been returned unsigned by
the mayor, and opposition to certain
provisions of the measure has de
veloped. For this reason council will
hold the ordinance in abeyance until
its next regular session, and in the
meantime it has been referred back to
the judiciary ' committee, which com
mittee will have a special meeting to
hear, any and all objections. Council
is not disposed to make the ordinance
work a hardship on any one.-
.Col. R. F. Rogers, L. N. Green and
R. C. Loveridge appeared before coun
cil last night and protested very vig
orously against -provisions of the
measure. These men did not apepar
jointly, but as individuals, each with a
complaint. Col. Rogers contended that
it would be unreasonable and a prac
tical impossibility to have negro tene
ment houses provided with sanitary
facilities similar to the facilities pro
vided for the better class of houses in
the city. He said he owned a large
number of negro houses, which he
would have to abandon unless an ex
ception be made in the case. CoL
Rogers also thought the plumbing in
spection fees high, and v thought the
ordinance should be made clearer in
some of its sections. Ho suggested
that the regulations be made accord
ing to districts or blocks. Mr. Green,
also an owner of numerous negro
houses, contended that it" would be im
possible to comply with the provisions
of the ordinance so far as negro
houses were concerned. He thought
there was no-need for connecting ne
gro houses with the sewerage system,
taking the position that properly car
ed for cesspools could do. Mr. Love
ridge said that the demands of the or
dinance would work a hardship on
people of small means.'
Mr. Green, Col. Rogers and Council
man Mclver thought that the costs'of
plumbing inspection should be covered
by taxes. Councilman Gerig stoutly
maintained that the costs of the
plumbing inspection should fall on all
alike, proportioned according to the
nature of the inspection. -
Councilman Gerig protested in, the
name of the judiciary committee that
there was; no intention of working a
hardship on any one. He said that
the committee had examined numer
ous plumbing measures, obtained from
other cities. Mr. Gerig said that the
fees provided for Ocala, for example,
were lighter than in any of the ordi
nances considered. At his instance
council decided to hold the measure in
abeyance and give citizens further op
portunity to make objections. ;
Those who have objections are ask
ed to draft amendments and submit
them for consideration.

SAVED MONEY TO THE CITY
Objections having been made by IL
W Tucker, "council, with the consent
of Robert Ebner, to whom the contract
was let two weeks ago without bids,
bast night received bids for laying the
water mains to the two septic tanks
of the sewerage system. It "was ex
plained that the contract had been
given to Mr- Ebner two weeks ago, be
cause at the time it was thought that
the city had the necessary pipe on
hand and the importance of having
the necessary work done immediately
was stressed.' Later the city found
that it did not have the necessary pipe,
and the decision to call for bids was
made. Mr. Ebner, having the lowest
bid, was again awarded the contract.
Mr. Tucker was the lowest bidder on
one item. He called attention to the
fact that Mr. Ebner's new bid was
much below his bid of two weeks ago,
and contended that the city had been
saved about $250 in the matter. With
this in view, Mr. Tucker asked that
council consider his bid. Council,
however, thought that the work should
all go to one man. -

There has been considerable delay
about getting this ond money. Con

much of it growing out of the recent

Council Determined by Some Means to
Have It Put In Better
Condition
Council is determined that , some
thing must, if possible, be done to re
pair the Silver Springs road, and th?
streets of the city. About $3,000 in
road taxes are due the city by the
county, and with this paid over the
city will have that much available.
Frederick Hocker, city attorney,
last night advised council to accept
the offer of H. M. Hampton to bring
mandamus proceedings with a view, to
compelling the county to put the Sil
ver Springs road in good condition.
Mr. Hampton, according to the city"
attorney, has agreed to handle the
case against the county if the city pay
the court costs, and Mr. Hocker takes
the position that the city would have
all to gain and nothing to lose except
the small cost of going into the courts.
There appears to be precedent, Mr.
Hocker said, for compelling a county
to keep up a main road through an an
nexed section of a city. This would
not, it was said, mean the return of
the Silver Springs strip to the county.
Council took no action with refer
ence to Mr. ' Hampton's proposition
last night. -
