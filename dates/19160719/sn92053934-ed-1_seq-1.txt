slayer of Joseph Derix, chauffeur for
the Central Auto company of La Salle,
111., today agreed to accompany La
Salle officers to Princeton. 111., the
county seat. Sherman was arrested
in a hotel last night following efforts
to sell the automobile taken when
Derix was slain. He tells a fantastic
story, declaring that he is a former
inmate of the Illinois stato hospital for
the insane at Elgin and is subject to
attacks of insanity, when he is pos
sessed with an irresistible impulse to
commit murder. He was committed
to the Elgin hospital, he says, follow
ing the slaying of two men in Texas,
later escaped and recently was given
a complete discharge. The murder of
the taxi-driver at Ladd, 111., he de
clared followed a scuffle, in which
Derix obtained Sherman's gun, which
Sherman says, was discharged acci
dentally. When arrested here, Sherman was
armed with the gun and a big supply
of cartridges.
BLACK-LIST HITS
NEW YORK FIRMS
.Most of American Traders Affected
by Decree of Groat Britain
Located in .Metropolis.
New York. July 19. With few ex
ceptions all American business firms
and individuals placed by the l'.ritish
government on the black-list under
the trading with the enemy act, have
their cjuarters in New York City.
.Most of these merchants expressed
no surprise today over the action of
Great Britain. J. A. Kahl, an ex
porter and importer, said:
"This black-list has been in the
hands of bankers all over the world
at least a year, to my personal knowl
edge. I havo known that I, for one,
have been black-listed. I am and
have been for 20 years an American
citizen. Not only has' my business,
which was mainly with China. Japan
and far eastern countries, been brok
en off completely by seizure of goods
but I have been unable to buy lulls
of exchange or in any other way set
tle my affairs."
Alfred Richter, a trader with Chi
nese's and Japanese merchants, said:
"My goods have been seized at
Hong" Kong and elsewhere regularly
until I stopped doing business. My
mail to agents in Canton, Tien-Tsin,
and other cities were returned to me.
The reason, so far as I c an guess that
I once, almost 30 years ago, was con
nected with a Gorman firm."
Mr. Richter said he had been a citi
zen of the United States for 25 years.
John S. Scully of Zimmerman and
Forshay, prominent German bankers,
said that all the officers of his com
pany are American citizens.
"We are considering means of tak
ing the matter up with the state de
partment within a day or two," said
Oscar L. Gubelman of Kanuth,
Nachod & Kuhn, bankers. "We feel
that we have been unfairly discrim
inated against. Wo have information
that many of our cables were inter
fered with."
'harks Hardy, a metal importer,
said the only reason he could think of
for the presence of his name on the
list was that he had cabled money to
relatives in Germany.

Russ Pays Japan for .Munitions.
Tokio. Charles Miller, a Russian fi
nancial agent, has arrived in Japan
to arrange for the payment of war mu
nitions purchased here and to investi
gate and study the commercial and in
dustrial conditions with a view- to pro
moting Russo-Japanese trade. Mr.
Miller predicts a steady increase in
commerce between the two countries
when the war is concluded. He said
that the abolishment of the sale of
vodka, while sacrificing a revenue of
over 500,000,000 rubles, has brought
about an important improvement in
the economic condition of the Russian
people and had greatly increased their
purc hasing powers.

them for the candidate they select.
Some party leaders are predicting
a close race between the three former
governors, Sul.er, Hanly and Foss

OF IOWA GUARDS
First Battalion of Third Infantry Ex

Toniirht or Tomorrow.
Dos Moines. Iowa, July 19. The Chi
cago Great Western railroad today
turned over to the Dos Moines inter
urban the equipment necessary to take
the first battalion of the Third Iowa
infantry to the Brownsville, Texas,
concentration camp of the Iowa na
tional guard. It was slated at Camp
Dodge that the battalion comprising
Companies A, U, C and D. probably
would be enroute before night tomor
row. There was little possibility, in the
opinion of officers that the troop
movement would begin before late to
morrow. It was pointed out that with
limited switching facilities coupled
with the fact that the iuterurban line
over which it will be necessary to
transport the troops is a single track
line, will make the movement slow.
About 25 cars divided into trains
according to their weight will be re
quired to move the first battalion.
Traific experts at the camp today
said they had not received word re
garding whether tourist sleepers had
been obtained for the transportation of
troops. They thought, however, that
the men would not be forced to travel
the entire distance in day coaches.
Packing of equipment began this
afternoon.

Race Riot Is
FearedNear
Death Scene
Chicago, July 19. Crowds gathered
in the vicinity of 320 Irving avenue
where yesterday the negro Henry P.
Mclntyre killed four people and was
himself, together with his wife, iater
killed, gave rise to fears of possible
race rioting early today and caused 50
policemen to be dispatched to the
scene. They dispersed the crowd
quickly. To prevent further difficulty
negroes were ordered by the police to
keep off the streets. They obeyed
promptly. 'Extra policemen were
placed on guard ia the district as a
precaution. It developed today that
back of the murders of yesterday and
forming an innocent means to them,
was an unserved warrant charging
Mclntyre with disturbing the peace. A
policeman sent tha; night to serve the
papers, found McPatyre away from
home. He decideel to wait until morn
ing. The police say this caused more
deaths than have figured in a
single crime in i years. Reports
from local hospitals this morn
ing indicated that the police
officers and others wounded in yester
day's tragedy probably would recover.
Edward Clement, detective sergeant,
was said to be in the most serious con
dition. Among the effects found in Mcln
tyre's house was a letter which he had
written to Trince Menelik of Abys
sinia. It was sent in January, 1915,
and returned unopened in April, 1916.
In it Mclntyre proposed colonizing
American negroes in Abyssinia, stat
ing that he had "organized a church
and also an immigration league in the
name of the Abyssinian government,"
although he knew "nothing about the
country or government except what
my father taught me or I read in
books, dear sir." Another sentence
read: "My father taught me from
'hildhood that A was my country and
that King M was my king and ruler;
there are ten African subjects here in
America who know- practically noth
ing of Africa." F'arther along he
wrote: "Some of us don't believe that
the African race has a king, dear sir.
There are thousands of loyal African
people that are wining to come back
to A, if our beloveu king will permit
us to, O King." '
Another negro, who like Henry
Intyre, worried about the sins of the
colored race occupied the attention of
the poilee today. He was George
Flower, a laborer who in scant attire
and his body "anointed" with lard
was racing up and clown in front of
his home trying to "drive the devil
from the race" when a policeman ar
rested him.
Chief of Police Healy said today that
he is without authority to restrain
persons who are merely peculiar in
their actions but not disorderly.
Marked traces of insanity must be
shown, he said, before the police could
act.
The chief made his explanation in
answer to a statement by Judge Harry
Olson, chief justice of the municipal
court that crimes such as that com
mitted by Mclntyre could be minim
ized if the police would arrest all per
sons found acting queerly or in a sub
normal manner.
Detectives were at work in the
negro section in which Mclntyre lived
today to ascertain homes where weap
ons are kept.
JlflE FRENCHMEN
TAKE 113 TEUTS
Small Body of Soldiers Works Clever
Kuse on Germans and Captures
Fort and All Within.
Paris, July 19. One of the most
striking episodes of the great Somme
offensive was the taking of the field
fort at Biac hes and the garrison of 113
men by nine French soldiers. The
fort had resisted throughout the artil
lery bombardment and the infantry at
tacks had been c hecked by murderous
machine gun fire. By a lucky chance
a French officer discovered the preci
ous secret that the terrible bombard
ment had made the fort vlunerable at
one point. Selecting a second lieuten
ant, two sergeants, a corporal and four
men, he led them on hands and knees
through the long grass to the spot
where there was a breach in the de
fenses. They reached their objective
point undiscovered.
Abruptly three of the FTench officers
leaped into the work shouting in sten
torian tones: "Forward with the bay
onet" and throwing bombs which ex
ploded in the dugout. The other six
remained behind ready to retreat if the
attempt failed. But the Germans, tak
en unawares, had no time to get their
weapons. When one of their number
fell shot by a revolver fired point
blank by the commanding officer, the
Germans, 113 in all, came out of their
shelters and surrendered, the FTench
assert.
The three French captors now be
gan to feel nervous, as they saw no
reason why the Germans should not
fall upon and exterminate them. But
at this moment the other six hurried
in. Their resolute energy imposed up
on the Germans, who believed that the
new arrivals were followed by many
others. The entire garrison was
marched to the French rear, escorted
by the nine captors who had not lost
a man.
