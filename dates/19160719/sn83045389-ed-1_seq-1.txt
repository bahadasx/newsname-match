3. Owing to a great number of thei
officers and enlisted men being citizens
of th's locality, this office and the com
manding' officers of organizations are
continually importuned by business men
and relatives of the soldters to release
them from duty, in view of the. fact
! that they are under no orders for im
mediate service. In addition to this,
the organizations are greatly handi
capped in the matter of mounted in
struction by the lack of horses; also;
in target practice and range firing. :
His Kxcellency, the Governor, will, j
therefore, recommend that, if practica

Better street-cleaning fat-ilities, * in
eluding more frequent collection of
garbage during the summer months,
and a rigid enforcement of all ordi
nances and health regulations relating:
to the sanitary condition of the city, is
the program which the Administrative
Board outlined yesterday afternoon at
a special session, which lasted for
nearly three hours. Action to put the
changes into effect will. it. in expected,
l>e adopted by the board at its usual
session to-day.
The plan proposed !>;. the hoard in
cludes the following items:
Collection of garbage three or four
times weekly during .lime, July, Au
gust apd September.
Tin forcing a regulation prescribing
the use of receptacles of uniform size.
Collection of ashes during June, July,
August and September once every two
weeks.
Knforcing an ordinance requiring
citizens to separate trash and ashes
from garbage.
Compelling individuals and firms to
remove garbage when in excess of
seventy-two gallons, required by city
ordinance.

All ordinances relating to this work
and regulation, which will be pre
scribed by the board, acting under au
thority vested in it when it supplanted
the Board of Health, will he groupod
together and published for three con
secutive days in all of ih<- llichmoml
daily newspapers. It is the determina
tion of the board to give the public
full knowledge of the law.-; and then
rigidly to enforce them. All violator*
will be summoned to Police ?'ourt.
To see that the law is complied with,
the hoard will probably direct Super
intendent of Streets Cohn to detail four
of his men an inspectors, upon whom
will be. conferred police powers. Their
fluty will be to see that any violators
are made to answer before the Police
Justice.
The hoard's decision upon this course
follows the adoption of a resolution
offered last week by (Snuinissioner
Hobson, asking Superintendent Cohn
for a report as lo Increasing the, ef
ficiency of his department in connec
tion with the collection of garbage.
Mr. Cohn Informed the hoard that with
an increased form and additional equip
ment he could make triweclcl.v collec
tions of garbage.
Chairman Hirschherg thought that
the board could accomplish the same
?lid without added expense to the city.

TO iircsTonu NOIULAL servicf:
The Catawba River is receding
almost as fast as it rose three days
ago. when the great wall of water
rushed down from the watersheds,
carrying bridges, factories and homes
before it. Railroad and other utilities
! companies are using large construction
repairing destruction. Several
, weeks will he required, it i?) said, to
! restore normal train services, and hun
dreds of thousands of cotton spindles
may be idle for a month. No reports
have reached the outside world from
Hickory or l.enoir, near the head
waters of the Catawba, since Sunday.
All fear of serious floods in South
Carolina have been dispelled by the
rapid fall of the Congaree and Broad
Rivers. Industrial plants have resumed
operations. The greatest loss will bo
to crops and live stock in the Congaree
Valley.
The rivers of East Tennessee have
reached their crests, and have begun
falling slowly. Some damage was done
in South Knoxvllle, where the water::
reached warehouses and homes on
lower ground, but the greatest loss
will be to crops, several thousand acres
having been flooded in the eastern part
of the Stale.
Conditions in' Virginia and West
Virginia are expected to be normal
within a day or two.
