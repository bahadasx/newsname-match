Worst Wind Storm in History of
Charlotte
The Charlotte Observer Saturday
morning: gave the following
account of the wind storm:
While Charleston and Augus
ta yesterday were in the grip of
a fearful hurricane with attend
ant heavy rains, Charlotte was
battling: throughout the dav and
long: into the night with a wind
storm that for severity, duration
and damage has never before
been equalled in the history of
the city.
The Southern Power Company,
Western Union, Postal,
Southern Bell Telephone and
Southern and Seaboard Railroads
were the chief sufferers,
particularly the first named, but
the damage was shared in bv
hundreds of individuals and corporations
in the city as well.
To give a detailed report of
the number and location of uprooted
trees, broken fences, falling
limbs, etc., in the city last
night would require a volume.
The wind was so furious and so
insistent that even electric signs,
supposed to be as immovably
fixed as anything built hereabouts.
were thrown to thp navp.
ments. Such was the case with
the Blake sign on West Trade
street and several others throughout
the city.
Inquiry at the office of the
United States Weather Bureau
last night brought forth interesting
data on the situation. The
tabulation of records received at
10 o'clock Friday night showed
that Charlotte registered the
highest wind velocity for the
day with Charleston second.
Furthermore Charlotte's wind
velocity was the most constant,
continuing throughout the day
and late into the night. Charlotte's
record at 8 o'clock was
48 miles, Charleston 36, Savannah
18, Wilmington 16, Raleigh
12, Asheville 6, and Augusta 14.
Charleston's highest velocity
was 48 miles, while that of Charlotte
at 7:45 p. m. was 54 miles,
and at 10 o'clock last night 52
miles.
The unique feature about the
wind here yesterday was that it
steadily increased throughout
the day and continued late last
night.
Local United States Weather
officials stated last night that the
storm at Charleston was practically
over and that while heavy
rains had fallen. 2.42 for th*? 24
hours, that no further damage
should be anticipated.
Keen Enthusiasm For The
Maxwell
When the Maxwell Motor
company announced luly 1 the
generous reduction in price on
its touring car and roadster, the
executives were prepared for a
somewhat increased demand for
the Maxwell product. But they
were not prepared for the tremendous
influx of business that
followed on the heels of the announcement.
Since the new Maxwell prices
became effective, the great in
crease on business has been felt
in every department of the organization.
This increase has
oeen reflected in the increased
demand upon Maxwell dealers
all over the the country.
The 1916 season was a most
prosperous one, but if early indications
count for anything, the
1917 season will surpass anything:
in the history of the automobile
industry. There is no
question but that the company's
policy of standardizing their car
and selling it at a figure that
would appeal to people of moderate
means will be justified by
the increased business.
Reminiuence of Civil War?53
Years Ago.
I wonder how many of my
old war comrades can call to
mind the event of 53 years ago
today? Well, we were at Hagerstown,
Maryland. This was
the ninth day since we began
our retreat from the famous battlefield
of Gettysburg on the 4th
of July, consequently thi. ..as
the 13th. We lay behind our
improvised breastworks of fence
rails, pole locks, etc., all expect
ing an attack from the yankees.
But to our supreme delight, i
tliprp "woe nrvtVlinrr rl/-vir?nr" olnnnf I

this line. Some time during the
darkness of that night we set
fire to the long line of rails and
turned our faces toward Williamsport
on the Potomac River.
We left Hagerstown in a
drenching rain v which lasted
nearly all night. On reaching
the river we found it swollen so
that wagons and teams could
not cross at the ford, therefore
we were obliged to go down the
river to Falling Water to cross
on pontoon bridges. However
the infantry crossed above the
ford by wading about twelve
hundred yards diagonally up
stream. It was just chin deep to
the writer?height 5 1-2 feet. We
had a hard time crossing that
river and getting out ot its banks.
Lots of the men had lost their
shoes in crossing and the banks
were slippery. The macada
mized roads were in a loblolly
so that the feet of the barefoot
were ground and lacerated by
the sharp gravel as thev would
slip at each step in hurrying to
regain their command. This
was the only time that I ever
saw our old veteran, Rev. J. A.
Bivens, completely out of pa
tience. Uncle Joe threatened
strongly to disobey orders for
the first time during his soldiery.
Could write lots more if circumstances
permitted.?O. P. Timist

A little slum child was enjoying
his first glimpse of country
life. He sat by the farmer's
wife, just as the sun was setting,
watching her pluck a chicken.
He was gravely silent for a
long time, then asked:
"Do yuu take off their clothes
every night, lady?"
At the company's general offices
in Detroit, letters and telegrams
from thousands of cities,
towns and villages all over the
country followed the announcement
of the reduced price.

IT PLEASES THE FARMERS
Reports from the agricultural
districts about the country indicate
that farmers are intensely
interested in the Maxwell announcement.
One Iowa farmer
wrote that he had always maintained
that eventually it would
be possible to buy a real automok:i_
t? it ?
une lor me price oi a good Morse
and buggy. He declared that a
reallv highclass driving horse
costs well over $300, while the
buggy and equipment brings the
cost up to a few hundred dollars
additional. There, he said, you
have the same amount of money
required to buy a Maxwell, a
highgrade motor car, whose
upkeep will prove far less than
tne upkeep of a driving outfit.
The response to the 1917 announcement
of the Maxwell from
both cities and country has been
exceptional and all the signs
predict a record-breaking year.

WORST STORM IN 23 YEARS
Crops Badly Damaged; Trees
Uprooted; Streams Swollen;
Bridges and Dams Washed
Out, and Other Damage
Done by Tropical
Storm Friday.
The most severe wind storm
experienced in this section since
the 31st of August 1893 develoo
ed Friday and lasted well iuto
the night. The storm struck
Charleston Thursday night and
passed inland in a northwesterly
direction. The first eftects were
felt here Friday morning in a
slow rain and east to northeast
wind which gradually increased
in force throughout the day. By
1 o'clock it was blowing a gale.
It is said that the fiercest wind
was about one o'clock Friday
night. No means of recording
the velocity of the wind were at
hand, but it is certain that it
readied above fifty miles an
hour, with sudden gusts going
above sixty perhaps. The highest
velocity recorded at Charleston
was sixt3*-two early Friday
morning, while fifty-four was
the highest at Charlotte and this
was about 7 o'clock in the after
noon. By daylight Saturday
morning the wind had died
away.
There was a downpour of rain
during the whole of the storm,
and the streams in the sections
visited by the storm were probably
fuller than at any time
since August 1908.
Crops were badly damaged by
the wind and high waters. Corn
and cotton were laid flat. Corn
was whipped and beaten into

There is hardlv a farm on

The wagon was washed
down the branch 40 or 50 yards,
the plowstocksrnd fertilizer were
scattered along the branch for a
considerable distance. The public
road from Pageland to Chesterfield
passes over this dam, and
the expense of rebuilding falls
on the county, it is supposed.
The old mill dam at Evans'

Charleston, S. C., Julv 14.? ^
The large naval collier Hector, C(
carrying 60 marines in addition ^
to her crew of 70 men and 12 of- 11
ficers, sank off Charleston late ^
today, according to a report d
made here by Captain Hunt of ei
the tug Vigilant, which tried to C
go to the Hector's assistance.
The steamer Alamo had been
standing by the Collier today, ^
having responded to her calls c
when the collier was disabled S
some 60 miles off here in last n
night's hurricane. ^
Captain Hunt was unable to *
get within more than three miles ^
of the Hector, and static conditions
were such that no wireless ^
report could be obtained from s1
tne Alamo. The sea still was
running high and it was not $
known here whether the Alamo a
had been able to take off the 142 b
persons aboard the Hector. b
From the steamer Arapahoe ^
which arrived here today came a
me repon mat a torpedo-boat c
destroyer was being towed in by s'
a tug. It was not known what ^
damage had been done to the
destroyer. The Arapahoe de- c
scribed the destroyer as "No. 25."
The Hector left Port Royal r
for Santo Domingo carrying the
marines who were recruits for ^
United States forces in Santo v
Domingo and Cuba. She at- n
tempted to put into the port
when the storm disabled her, but a
according to Captain Hunt, was h
unable to get further than to
within about 9 1-2 miles from b
the Charleston lightship before s<
she sank. Captain Hunt said d
| part of the collier's superstruc!
ture remained above water.
The Hector displayed 11,200 S
tons and was built at Sparrow's ?
Point, Md., in 1908.
