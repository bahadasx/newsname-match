as Result of Floods in
Southern States.
WATEREE RIVER RISES
IN SOUTH CAROLINA
Conditions Improve. However, in
North Carolina, Tennessee
and Virginia.
As reports continue to filter
through from parts of western
North Carolina which have been
isolated by the recent floods, the
t death list grows. Six additional
fatalities reported today bring the
known death list to forty, while
at least si?^persons arc missing.
Eleven persons were drowned
in the villages of Bat Cave and
Chimney Rock, which, it now develops,
were hard hit by the
storm. Two unidentified bodies
were found near Belmont today,
N while another death is reported
from near Greenville in the falling
of a railway scaffold undermined
by the floods.
Wateree River Rising-.
While flood waters were receding in
Xnrth Carolina. Tennessee and Vir
glnia today, the Wateree river, in
South Carolina was rising and Atlantic
Coast Line officials reported that two
bridges on their lines had been flooded,
with a consequent interruption in
service.
Conditions around Asheville and
throughout western North Carolina
were much Improved today, with workmen
busy repairing railroads and replacing
bridges and putting industrial
plants into working order again.
In Virginia and the Piedmont section
of South Carolina rapid headway is
being made in repairing railroads.
The material damage in the floods in
the four states probably never will be
definitely estimated, but it seems certain
now that it will total at least
$15,000,000

MAINE POLL STIRS
DEMOCRAT^ HOPES
Claim Made That President
Wilson Is Stronger Than
Four Years Ago.
i
D x JX. U. lVlJbS5>H,JNliJbiv.
NEW YORK. July 19.?Democrats are!
very- much encouraged by the preliminary j
reports they have received on a poll now
in progress in Maine to show the drift of
political opinion. Both political parties
are profoundly concerned over the election
in Maine, which will be held September
11, for the choice of governor,
state ticket, two United States senators
and reprseentative in Congress. The pres- ;
idential electors will be chosen in November.
Always the voting in Maine has been
regarded as important, not only as indicative
of general popular sentiment, but
for the moral effect upon th? wavering
vote of the country at large. This year
the campaign takes on added imi>ortance
from the fact that, owing io a vacancy
occasioned by death, two United States
senators are to be elected.
Control of Senate at Stake.
As the control of the Senate in the next i
Congress is a prize valued by each party |
as second only to the presidency, Maine j
will be fought for as never before, since
it is regarded that the Senate will be \
exceedingly close at best and a single J
senatorship may give one party or the j
other control. i
The first returns cover the polling of |
one county complete. This county in 1912 j
gave Wilson 1,700. while the combined j
Taft and Roosevelt vote was 3.300. Roosevelt
leading. The poll this time indicates
a marked change of form, the democrats
running up to 3.750 and the republicans
dropping to 2,250. These figures are evidently
approximate and stated to disguise
the particular county, as reference
to the returns for 1912 does not show
any such exact division of the vote. The
point is, however, that according to the
democratic count the ratio has changed
and indicates growing strength of President
Wilson. The poll is being continued,
and with renewed vigor, as the democrats
find themselves heartened by the
first showing.
No Republican Figures.
The republicans, who have not got
steam up yet in their campaign in the
nation or even in Maine, have no figures
to give out. although individual reports
of conditions will no doubt be laid
before the joint meeting next Thursday
of a special committee of senators
and the national campaign committee.
This special committee, appointed by
Senator Gal linger, chairman of the republican
conference, which is to work
with the national committee and have
special charge of the campaigns for the
election of United States senators, consists
of Senators Weeks, chairman;
Smoot. Curtis, Sutherland and Wadsworth.
Chairman McCormick of the democratic
national committee stated some
time ago that Senator Saulsbury of
Maryland would head a special committee
of democratic senators which would
be charged with like responsibilities
and duties for the democrats.
The republicans are very much interested
in the meeting next Saturday at
Syracuse of the progressive state committee.
which is to determine the indorsement
or refusal of indorsement by
the progressive organizations in NewYork
state of Hughes and Fairbanks.
A spirit of revolt such as was exhibited
in New Jersey last Saturday against
indorsement, and which was successful
in the meeting of the Jersey state committee
by a vote of 7 to 5, exists among
the progressives in this staff
to what decree can be shown only by a
roll call. George W. Perkins, who still
is the titular leader of the progressives
in New York, while also a member of
the campaign committee of the regulars.
is confident that he will be able to
hold the state committee of the progressives
in line and secure an indorsement
of the regular ticket.
Lively Fight in Prospect.
He is promised a lively fight, however,
by the insurgents, and the approaching
meeting is regarded as of importance.
It is realized that the refusal of indorsement
by the New York progres- i
sive organization would have consider- j
able sentimental effect upon the or- J
phaned bull moose in other states, and j
ler-d weight to Col. Parker's proposition j
for another national convention to!
choose a stepfather for the orphans, j
At present, the republican managers are j
doing everything in their power to placate !
the progressives and to offer them warm j
hospitality in the republican camp, with ,
full freedom of the range and the best
of browsing. Candidate Hughes will ac- !
eentuate this policy on his western trip. \
Orders have already gone out to the re
publican managers in the cities where Mr. j
Hughes is to stop, to invite the pro- :
gressives to take part in the receptions j
to be provided for the candidates, and j
they are to be given front seats in the j
synagogue.
Speaking of progressives, it is said that j
the democrats will not announce their ;
campaign committee until after Mr. 1
Hughes' speech of acceptance, when they )
win put a nunjber of progressives on their J
committee. ' i
Wants to Debate Poindexter.
Democratic national "headquarters to- J
day gave out the following:
"Ole Hanson, a leading progressive of
the state of Washington, who has announced
his intention of supporting
Wood row Wilson, has sought the assistance
of the democratic national committee
to force Senator Miles Poindex- ;
ter of Washington into a joint debate with !
him on the general subject of whether the
Wilson administration should be returned
to power.
" 'We can carry Washington.' Mr. Hanson
telegraphed today. "Can you shame
Senator T'oindexter into debating with
me. the subject. Shall Wilson be returned?
Poindexter is afraid, and, like Hughes, is
a trimmer. Both have indorsed the
American flag, but refuse to get down to
fundamentals. Have challended Poindex
ter repeatedly, but to no avail."
Hanson Former Republican.
"Mr. Hanson is a former republican.
Two years ago he was the candidate for
i.'nited States senator in his state and
polled 83,000 votes, which was approxiipately
one-third of the total vote cast.
Roosevelt carried the state in 1912 by
20,858. Mr. Hanson is now actively and
aggressively supporting the President.
Poindexter. whom he challenges to a debate,
is a candidate for re-election on
the republican ticket, although he was
elected six years ago as a progressive."
Former Representative William F. Murrav,
now postmaster of Boston, was a recent
visitor to democratic headquarters.
"The big fight in Massachusetts this
fall." said Mr. Murray, "will be over the
l.'nited States senatorship. Senator Lodge
will have to fight for his seat. The democrats
will probably nominate ex-Mayor
Fitzgerald of Boston to run against him,
and if it turns out to be a big 'Wilson
year." as we expect, the democratic candidate
may win
"At any rate, the nomination will be of
value looking forward to two years hence,
when Senator Weeks will be up for re - I
election." _

HANLY AND SULZER
CONTEST IS TENSE
Chafin Suggested as Compromise
Candidate as Prohibition
Convention Opens.
KEYNOTE IS SOUNDED
' BY DANIEL A. POLING
Attack on Militarism and Preparedness
Programs of Big Parties
Cheered in St. Paul.
: i
ST. PAUL, July 19.?The
convention of the national prohibition
party was called to order
at the Auditorium today with
delegates from practically every
state in attendance. Meetings
of rival bodies of delegates favoring
the nomination of J. Frank
Hanly of Indiana and William
Sulzer of Xew York preceded
the convention session, and tinder-surface
talk of E. \\ . Chafin
a.s a compromise candidate grew
as the tenseness of the llanlySulzcr
contest increased.
The willingness of such men as
Sul7.r?r. Hanlv Enn-pno V Kne? r\f \fa??a
chusetts and Sumner W. Haynes of
Portland. Ind., to be considered as
presidential candidates indicates, the
leaders say, a widening? of the party's
influence, and they expect thousands of
former progressives to vote with them.
Some Predict Close Kace.
Some party leaders are predicting a
close race between the three former
governors, Sulzer, Hanly and Foss, with
Haynes running in fourth place. Those
more sure of the outcome express the
belief that the contest has narrowed
down to two men?Sulzer and Hanly.
Mr. Sulzer telegraphed his followers
that he would arrive here Thursday and
enter the fight in an effort to keep the
nomination from going to Mr. Hanly.
The arrival of John P. St. John of
Kansas, the party's candidate for
President in 1884, evoked the first outburst
of applause by' delegates.
Temporary Chairman Daniel A. Poling
of Boston delivered the keynote address
He attacked the militarism and
the preparedness program of the democratic
and republican parties.
The delegates cheered his remarks.
Mr. Poling completed his speech at
j- y giocjt noon ana a brief demonstration
followed.
Mr. Poling's Keynote Speech.
"The call of the hour is the challenge
of a supreme opportunity, to an unparalleled
sacrifice. These are the
words of triumph,?peace, prosperity
and prohibition. Elect 'prohibition.
Write woman into the constitution.
Turn out the exploiters of the people.
Take private profit from war. Stop the
slaughter of peace. Save America and
serve the world."'
In these words Temporary Chairman
Daniel A. Poling concluded his keynote
address at the outset of the convention.
Mr. Poling, declaring that the prohibition
party was now the sole representative
of progress!vism in national
politics, extended an official and hearty
invitation to the 4,000,000 voters who
supported the progressive party ticket
in 1012. and suggested that whatever
the technical name of his own party
should be upon the official ballot this
year, it would be known thenceforth as the
Liberal party of the United States.
The Party's Dominant Purpose.
Mr. Poling described the party's dom
inant purpose since its birth, September,
1S69.
"In its first convention the prohibition
party declared what it has never since
failed to declare,?that only by capturing
the government, the whole government,
can the power of the liquor
institution be finally broken. Not until
the three branches of our government,
judicial, legislative, and executive, are
brought into harmony and are directed
by one governmental voice, will national
prohibition become a fact.
"For have we not witnessed in a
thousand cities and in a dozen states
the law and the courts defied; defied
by base public officials who granted
immunity to those who sold and to
those who bought, and by the political
parties of which these delinquent executives
were but the hired minions,
the directed hands of the directing
bodies, political parties that in their
platforms openly announced and from
the stump brazenly declared that if
elected to power they would nullify
the statutes and make anarchy respectable?
"Until citizens having a common
numose of public nolicv eet to.rether.
.stay together, and vote together, leaving
entirely those other citizens who
are of another mind as to the public
questions at issue, they are as helpless
as a hound baying at the moon."
Party Supremacy Necessary.
After paying a tribute to the founders
and leaders of the national prohibition
movement for the forty-seven
years of its history, Mr. Poling pointed
out that during this period twentyone
other national political organizations.
indifferent or hostile to prohibition.
have come into existence and
died, and that the anti-liquor forces
of the land have already accepted
two-thirdsx of the party's program,
namely (1) that prohibition is the
only solution of the liquor problem,
and (2) that national prohibition
must be the ultimate goal.
"And even now." he continued, "the
multitude are turning to say with us,
there can be no national prohibition
without a prohibition party supreme
at Washington.
* 'The whole strategy of the campaign
for us from now on must be built
about the proposition that until the
government is captured our principles
are helpless, for we can do nothing.
Our platform, our candidates, our
party administration, our party papers
and party speakers, our entire program.
must be dedicated to the one
monumental effort to win the three
departments of the government, to
elect national prohibition."

THREE BIG SHARKS SEEN
IN RIVER ATANNAPOUS
Swim Beside Schooner and Then Up
to Bridge?Naval Academy
Bathers Alarmed.
Special IXspitch to The Star.
ANNAPOLIS, Md., July 19.?Sharks
are in local waters. That Washington
White, cook aboard the state police
schooner May Brown, could not have
been mistaken when he says he saw
three of the big sea monsters swimming
along in the waters of the harbor
yesterday is evidenced by the
fact that George Collins, keeper of
the Short Line railroad bridge across
the Severn river, saw one of the deepsea
fish early today. And perhaps
others may be in the river.
Soon after he observed the big fish
me iniormauon was generally spreau,
and It caused grave fear among people
about Annapolis, especially those
who frequent the bathing shores of the
river.
Mr. Collins asserts that the shark
came close to the bridge. He says that
it swam gently along the surface of the
water, circled about several times and
then disappeared in the depths.
One Was Ten Feet Long.
"I watched for a long time," said Mr.
Collins, "to see if it would reappear and
the direction it might take."
Mr. Collins stated that the fish ap- j
peared to be about ten feet long. This
is the size of the big fish that have :
brought terror to the bathers at resorts '
aiorig the Atlantic coast from New1
York to Florida.
Residents of Annapolis are alarmed. ;
Bathers are taking extraordinary precautions
in view of the situation. Many>
residents of the Naval Academy and
families of officers living in the city
frequent the shores of the river fori
bathing purposes, and besides there is
a large contingent who bathe from the
deep-water point at Wardour, which is
close to the spot where the shark was !
seen today.

BATTLE RAGES OH STOKHOD
Issue in Great Conflict in Galicla
Still Hangs in Balance, According
to Reports From j
Petrograd.
LONDON, July 19, 2:22 p.m.?
The Russians have crossed the
Carpathians and have penetrated
a day's march into Hungary, according
to a dispatch to the Star
from Petrograd.
The dispatch says the Russians
are threatening the Austrian rear
in the mountains.
The advance is being made, according
to this information, by
the armies of Gen. Letchitzky,
which are again on the move
after an interval of quiet.
Three Russian Advances.
PETROGRAP, July 18. via London.
July 19.?Although the Issue of the struggle
between the opposing forces in the
region of the Stokhod river still hangs In
the balance, and there has been during
the last few days no essential change in
the situation along the main Russian
front, the Russians have achieved thrae
important advances at widely separated
points in the eastern war theater.
The first is the successful drive from
the new quarter in Volhynia, southeast of
Latttk. The second is an advance of the
extreme southern wing of Gen. BrussilofTs
forces along the high road leading
into Hungary, and the third is the improved
situation in the Caucasus resulting
from the taking of Baiburt.
In the first region the Russian operations
are now being directed against
the left wing of Gen, Boshm-Ermelli's
army near Sviniuskv, which has already
yielded ground before the fierceness
of the Russian assaults.
Of the four Austrian army groups
employed against Brussiloff's forces,
Boshm-Ermelli's group has been the
least affected by the Russian offensive,
and, after its initial withdrawal from
Dubno, at the beginning of the Russian
campaign, has held its ground firmly
against all the Russian attempts to
push the advance to the Galician frontier
town of Brody. The beginning of
the further retreat of this group,
therefore, is considered extremely important
and may open up a new Russian
radius of attack from the north.
With their advance along the Kirlibaba-Maramaro-Sziget
road the Russians
are in possession of four important
lines leading into Hungary. Following
up their spectacular success,
which has taken them within a month
across the whole of Bukowina. they
are proceeding steadily forward, apparently
with little resistance.
The taking of Baiburt, which has
been the goal of the central Caucasian
armies ever since the fall of Krzerum.
has definitely ended, according to military
opinion here, all chances of a
successful Turkish counter-olTensi ve,
which, with Raiburt as a base, the
Turks have for months been carrying
on with the object of regaining the
enure ireDizonu-^racruiu area.
Retreat Across the Lipa.
A Russian victory over Teutonic
forces in southern Volhynia has resulted
in their being: driven across the
River Lipa and beyond that stream,
says a war office statement issued tola
y. Indications . are. the statement
adds, that the retreat was effected in
the greatest disorder. '
In the Riga region efforts by the
Germans to retake positions they had
lost were unsuccessful.
The official statement says:
"In the Riga region there was an artillery
duel. The Germans at many
places attempted unsuccessfully to recapture
lost trenches.
"As the result of the latest skillful
operations of Gen. Sakaroff's troops in
Volhynia we gained a victory July 1?,
ivhich brought up 13.000 prisoners and
thirty guns, as announced yesterday,
md enabled us to sweep the enemy
completely from the left bank of the
ower Lipa, driving him to Krassoff and
jeyond the river. Judging by the
ibundance of war material the enemy
ibandoned, he retreated in great dis>rder.
Some of the seventeen heavy
juns captured were yesterday already
jombarding enemy positions on the
south bank of the Lipa."
