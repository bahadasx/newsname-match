Bitterness Between Hanley
Sulzer Bodies Becomes
!. Greater.
Et. Paul, Minn., July 19.—The con
vention of the national prohibition
party was called to order at 10:20
o'clock this morning at the audi
torium, delegates from practically
every state attending.
The arrival of John P. St. John of
Kansas, the party's candidate for
president in 1884, evoked the first out
burst of applause from the delegates.
Meetings of the rival bodies of dele
gates favoring the nomination of J.
Frank Hanley and Wm. Sulzer pre
ceded the convention session and the
under-surface talk of E. W. Chafln
as a compromise candidate, grew as
the bitterness of the Hanley-Sulzer
contest increased.
The first big demonstration of the
convention came with temporary
Chairman Poling's attack, in his ad
dress, on the militarism and prepar
edness programs of the Democratic
and Republican parties. The dele
gates stood up throughout the audi
torium and cheered.
St. Paul, July 19.—The prohibition
national convention assembled this
morning in the ^auditorium at St.
Paul, Minnesota, representing dele
gates and visitors from every state in
the union, was formally opened by
Virgil G. Hinshaw, national Chairman.
Mr. Hinshaw, in his opening remarks,
spoke in part as follows:
"Our party ship has served as a re
fuge to those who would vote with
clean hands, and as a life-boat to
those who have been cast adrift by
wrecked liners.
"This, the year 1916, marks the
high-tide of prohibition sentiment in
America and-the world. We are not
here to perpetuate and create anew
an avenue of expression for the mul
titudes who have caught the vision
and desire to register their convic
tions fdr an emancipated' womanhood
and childhood, for the abolishment of
crime 'by the. elimination ,:of,vqrlme'S
producer, for the ultimate establish
ment of a world court of justice,, apd
for-:honest government.
"We are met Tiere to put In nomi
nation candidates for president and
vice president the mention of whose
names will be felt and recognized in
every home in America.
"We are here to inaugurate a cam
paign that will reach every voter of
every county and every state of .the
union. We are here to enlist service,
to call for sacrifice, and to perfect an
organization that will be as efficient
as our conscience is clear and as pro
ductive of results as our mind is pur
poseful.
"We have a clear field. We are the
one organization in this campaign
that stands for the woman, the child,
the home, and for the conservation of
humanity."
Mr. Hinshaw then introduced the
temporary chairman of the convene
tlon, Daniel A. Poling, of Boston.

ASQUWWS
Of EXPEDITION
Intimates that There Was
Basis for Adverse Criti
cism Anent Venture.
London, July 19.—Premier Asquith
intimated in the House of Commons
yesterday.' that there was some basis
for the. adverse! criticism of the con
duct of the' -British expedition in
Mesopotamia. After the battle of
Ctesiph'on last November, he said,
General Sir John Nixon, who was then
in command, telegraphed that the
medical arrangements were quite sat
isfactory.
"Thousands died," one of the mem
bers called.
Later, Mr. Asquith continued, unof
ficial reports were received which
seemed to point to a very different
state of affairs and a commission was
appointed to investigate the whole
matter. A report of the commission
was received by the government of
India which was holding it until the
Indian commander in chief had an
opportunity to submit his observations
thereon. The commission reported
that everything possible was now be~
ing done.
Regarding the transport facilities,
Mr. Asquith said, the necessity of at
tempting to relieve Kut-Bl-Amara
was so urgent that it was thought
right to push on the troops In advance
of their transport.
The Mesopotamian operations had
excited widespread and legitimate' in
terest and anxiety, the premier con
tinued, and incidents had occurred
which had aroused doubt whether the
best means had been adopted to -briny
about the ends in view. Every step
had been taken on the advice of the
military authorities and the defects
In the medical and transport services,
had been remedied.

awake in our enemies the hope that
they may yet be able to conquer us.
"Any brave and honorable soldier
may have the misfortune to be taken
prisoner. Even then he oan stU help
his Fatherland by fulfilling his duty.
In this case his duty consists in giv
ing no information when questioned
by the enemy. Even the disclosure of
his age, training and service may be
harmful to our interests. Other
things which he must not tell the
enemy are:
What part of the line his unit bald
previously.
How and when he came to his pres

What units are In the neighborhood.
The -positions of headquarters,
dumps and depots-
The strength and morals of his own
troops.
