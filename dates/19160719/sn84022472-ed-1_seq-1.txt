John H. Judson, aged eight, died
of infantile paralysis today at Silver
Beach, and the popular summer re
eort, thronged with families in which
there are one or more children, is a
scene of turmoil.
Despite the testimony of a certifi
cate issued by the health department
Authorities 'of Brookn, the child,
who arrived Saturday, was taken 111
Sunday afternoon. Dr. Edward H.
J( Hennessey of Stratford, was called
into, consultation yesterday and he
determined the case was one of polio
myelitis. ' The child succumbed this
morning. He was the nephew of
Chief Allen D. Judson of Stratford
One more case of suspected polio
myelitis was recorded today. Mary
Rahow, aged one year, of 170 Front
street, was removed last night to Hill
side home at the recommendation of
Dr. C 'N. Haskell but this morning
Dr. Abraham Sophian, the health ex
pert, declared he didn't think the case
one of poliomyelitis.
' It was announced this morning that
consulting physicians had determined
that' Mary Tanaski ' of 17 Railroad
court, whose case had been pro
nounced positive poliomyelitis, is
really one of epidemic meningitis. She
is recovering. 1
A child removed to .Hillside home
Lfor Dr. W. H. Donaldson yesterday
was recorded as named - Bresler, but
today it was learned that her- name
Is Anna Brown. . She lived at 137
(Madison avenue. .. Her case is defin
ite poliomyelitis. A young man who
fhad Jived at that ad ress -ut who
(wasn't In the house when the quar
antine was established,- has been liv
ing somewhere else. : Persons in the
factory where he worked objected to
his .presence without a health certifi
cate and when he went to the health
'hoard rooms .today, they decided he
would have to be quarantined be
cause he had been exposed to infec
tion in the early stages of the case. -
Fifteen of the 20 recognized dump
ling places in the city were closed to-
five .remaining open are on Norman,
William, Pine and Fifth streets and
Central avenue. Signs will be placed
on the others. '
Letters will be mailed to all the
department stores of the city today
(requesting that children under 10 years
of age be excluded. It was Intimated
at the meeting of the board of health
this noon that co-operation is expect
ed from the stores, but that if the
measure Is neglected steps will be
taken to change the request to an
order.
The board' of health met shortly
1 before noon today. Drs. Valery Ha
rvard of Fairfield, C. C. Godfrey- and
Henry Blodget attended. Mayor
Wilson was also present. Dr. Sophian
Itook up with the board and pbysU
):iaas plans for sanitation.
. Dr. Godfrey's suggestion that Boy
Scouts be asked to campaign against
lilies was approved. The mayor sug
gested that they, ajso check up un
sanitary conditions in the city. "
-' Dr. Sophian emphasized the Im
portance of examining the milk sup
(ply. He suggested that no milk be
tallowed in the city unless the dealer
, has a certificate. Taxing the dealers
ifor the inspection would pay the
costs of sending agents out of the
icity and state for examining the milk.
: He said a check should be kept on
'- every cow whose milk is used here,
, no matter how far away the cow is.
He proposed numbering the cows. A
laboratory could be equipped here
for $1,000, he said. A central steril-
- izatlon plant, Dr. Sophian declared,
would be ideal. Mayor Wilson said it
would take a long time to get, and
' Dr. Sophian said that perhaps some
company would build one here "on
' approval.
Funds for the health campaign will
. 'be obtained by borrowing, the mayor
- (Intimated. He said the department
Jehall use all its funds now, and that
- mora will be transferred by the board
j of apportionment. Afterward., he ln
jtimated, the common council will push
tthrough a plan whereby money may
'be borrowed.
f I Dr. Sophian today suggested to
physicians that they wear caps and
gowns while attending paralysis pa
jtlents, 'and that they use a spray for
their noses and throats daily besides
taking the ordinary precautions with
i their hands. The physicians at the
tmeeting agreed that it is desirable that
all sick, other than paralysis patients,
be visited first in the. rounds of the
i- physicians.
; Three new nurses were added to the
. 'health department staff today. At
' the same time a measure was adopted
whereby all houses containing persons
whohave come from other cities will
be examined and if conditions aren't
Jhygienic the children will be exclud-
'-ed. All -children . onder 10 will be
barred from entering the city to stay,
i. An Italian-speaking family from
'New Tork, which has settled in Island
Brook avenue; will be removed from
. ;the city.
Only persons of 10 years of age or
.' less; will be excluded from Sunday
' schools, the Bridgeport Pastors' asso
ciation announced today after a con
jgarenc with health , of ficlals. ,

Reconciliation Effected With
Husband After She Had
Been Taken to Hospital.
. Mrs. Charles Oswald who on July S,
swallowed bichloride of mercury tab
lets with suicidal intent ' died this
morning at the Bridgeport hospital
where she was removed immediately
after her rash act. Mrs. Oswald who
was but 18 years old, took the poison
because of grief over her husband's
apparent Inattention.
Th. Oswalds home is in Vermont,
and - when the husband came to this
city some time ago to work as a
guard at the plant of the Remington
TJ. M. CV Co., Mrs. Oswald remained
in her home town. Then her hus
band had her come to this city and
they went to live at the Asylum street
address.
On July 3, the husband received a
letter from an acquaintance In the
Vermont town stating that the young
wife had been often seen in the com
pany of other men while the hus
band was in this city. A- quarrel
resulted' from the letter and Mrs. Os
wald brooded over the accusation and
went to her room and took the pois
on. ' ,
After Mrs. Oswald had 'been remov
ed to the hospital, friends affected a
reconciliation, the wife took a turn
for the better, and it was thought
that she had excellent chances for
recovery. Her condition, however,
became worse again, resulting in her
death this morning. '

WATCHING HERE
FOR SUBMARINE
FROM GERMANY
Rumor Starts That Cargo
Carrying "Bremen" Is
Bound for Bridgeport.
WATERFRONT AGOG
OVER NEWS REPORT
G-2 and G-3, Lake Vessels,
Mistaken For U-Boat By
Excited Persons.
Waterfront circles were in a tur
moil today over the rumor that the
big merchant submarine Bremen, sis
ter ship to the Deutschland, had been
sighted in Long Island Sound and was
headed for Bridgeport harbor where
it vwould dock. The story first ap
peared in a New Tork newspaper
and of course caused a sensation. In
quiries as to the truth of the report
poured into Bridgeport thick and fast
as the story spread these inquiries
coming from shipping and news agen
cies, newspapers, the large German
mercantile houses in New Tork arid
from many others.
The first story reported that the
Bremen had been positively identified
and that she was sailing down the
Soifhd bound for Bridgeport. Soon
the tugs of the Bridgeport Towing Co..
the cruiser launches from the Lake
Torpedo Boat Co. and many private
yachts and launches put out from the
harbor for the purpose of ascertain,
ing the truth of the report and of es
corting the Bremen into haven here
if the story was true. Newspaper
men and photographers from New
Tork city began to arrive here on ev
ery incoming train. Early in the
day the tickers in the stock brokers'
offices all over the country carried a
report that the Bremen was off Black
Bock harbor and had been recognized
by. officials of the Black Rock Tacht
club. ' '
James L. McGovern, collector of the
port, and a party of newspapermen
and officials of the Lake Co. went out
on the Sound about noon on a recon
noiterlng sail in the cruiser launch
Lola. They saw no trace of the sub
marine, however. As the day ad
vanced it became evident that some
persons who had seen boats which Jhe
Lake company is building for the U.
S. navy out for trial on the Sound had
undoubtedly mistaken these boats for
the Bremen.
Today the G-3, one of the subma
rines which the Lake Torpedo Boat
Co. has nearly completed for the gov
ernment went out on the sound for
trial trips. She was for a time off
Black Rock harbor. The G-2 has
also been outside the harbor' on trial
trips but neither boat was out last
night and Lake Co. officials said to
day that neither boat could be mis
taken for the Bremen. They said
anyone familiar with submarines
would know that the Bremen was
much longer than any of the Lake
boats. ' . .
Athough a watch was maintained
at all parts of the harbor, up to press
hour today no tidings of the -Bremen
had been received. . Capt Archie
Guthrie of the McCaffrey line tug
came into the harbor from New Lon
don at 1 o'clock today. He said his
tug had been on the Sound practically
all night but had seen nothing of the
Bremen. He reported the weather as
not very clear last night.
DEUTSCHLAND SAILS SOON.
Baltimore, July 19 Shut off entire
ly, from the view of the public at her
pier, the German merchant submarine
Deutschland is believed to be ready to
sail at any moment her , commander,
Captain Paul Koenig, is ordered, by
his American agent . to depart.
There was little activity apparent
about the boat today, it being said all
of the return cargo of crude rubber
and nickel is now in the hold.
HOLDERS DON'T
WANT ARGUMENT
OVER OPEN SHOP
Don't Care What Manufac
turers Call Them, If Con
ditions Are Right.
"We don't care what they call their
,Knt nrnviderl conditions within are
all right," was the comment of J. R.
CLeary, who is in charge of tne mow
ers' strike here, when ho read the
Bridgeport Manufacturers' announce
ment today in regard to the strike.
The manufacturers announced that
"these factories are operated on the
open shop plan and that the present
ooHtoHnn for a flat minimum wage
without reference to . ability, and the
recognition of other than any indi
vidual employe, will not under any
circumstances be considered."
Mr. O'Leary said he and the strikers
didn't care to argue the open shop
question. He said they didn't care
.h.t manufacturer is nleased to call
his plant provided conditions inside
suit the men.
A meeting of the helpers, scratchers
nd other laborers emnloved in foun
dries will be held this evening at Bar
tenders' hall and another meeting ot
unorganized molders will be held at
Rakoczi hall in the West End.
PLANS FOR NEW HAVEN STATION
New Haven, July 19 The new rail
road station for - New Haven, long
planned for by officials, seemed one
step nearer today when Vice-President
Buckland, of the company, called up
on Mayor Rice, to present him with
additional plans for a lay-out of tracks
and station facilities.
PENNY RATE
ON POSTAG
IN U.S. SOON
Postmaster General Says
That Efficient Manage
ment Should Allow Rec
ommendation Next Year
For One-Cent Rate on
Letters.
Washington, July 19 Post
master General Burleson told
the National Association of
Postmasters' convention that if
revenues from second class mail
were increased; "extravagance
for useless postal service" in
the rural mail system were
curtailed, and payments to rail
road, for mail, transportation
under the new space basis
were reduced, he could recom
mend to Congress next year
that letter postage be reduced
to one cent.
WANT WILSON TO
SPEAK HERE FOR
FALL CAMPAIGN
Lavery Repudiates State
ment Attributed to Him
As to Donovan.
Plans to have President Wilson
speak in Bridgeport if possible during
the coming , campaign were discussed
last night at the meeting of the ex
ecutive board which comprises the
Democratic town committee. Attorney
Hugh J. Lavery was re-elected town
chairman and Bartholomew Brady was
elected secretary for the fourteenth
time. They will at once get in touch
with the national committee and make
every endeavor to have the President
speak in Bridgeport this JalL The pos'
sibility of securing speakers of nation
wide reputation were discussed and
also arrangements for a series of ral
lies and a whirlwind campaign to
start in September.
Town Chairman Lavery declared to
day that the meeting was a most en
thusiastic and tharmonlus gathering.
The session was an executive one.
Town Chairman Lavery denied the
statement printed in The Morning Tel
egram that he had exclaimed during
the meeting: "I am not going to have
Jerry Donovan."
'Candidates were not discussed dur
ing the meeting,' declared the town
chairman today. "vVe, in this com
mittee, are not concerned with candi
dates at this time. It Is our business
to elect them after they are nominat
ed. I did not mention any names and
never said what I am quoted as say
ing. I don't know where the reporter
got that dope. He must have been
dreaming. Two of the members of the
committee could not be present be
cause they have illness at home. They
called me on the telephone in the af
ternoon, however, and they will be at
the next meeting which is subject to
my call. Tou can say that there is
absolute harmony among the members
of the committee, we are planning an
active campaign and look for success
this fall."
ANOTHER FANATIC,
SCANTILY GARBED,
KEEPS COPS BUSY
Chicago, July 19 Another negro
who, like Henry J. Mclntyre, the in
sane slayer of four persons here yes
terday, worried about the sins of the
negro race .occupied the attention of
the police today. He was George
Flower, a laborer who, in scant at
tire, and his body "anointed" with
lard, was racing up and down in front
of his home trying to "drive the devil
from the race" when a policeman ar
rested him.

SCHOOL BOARD
WORRIED ABOUT
COAL STORAGE
' f
McNeils Deny Having Op
tion on Whitney Tract
Sell Present Location.
Members of the board of education
today on learning that the Archibald
McNeil & Sons Co., Inc., had sold its
coal pockets to the Salts Textile Mfg.
Co., began to wonder where they will
store the coal which they had planned
to buy for the schools and place in
the McNeil company's bins. Papers
transferring the McNeil property at
Noble avenue and Howe street ' and
fronting on the Fequonnock river, to
the -alts company have been passed
but have not yet been recorded. The
purchase price is reported to be in
excess of $150,000.
The McNeil company secured the
property from Frank Miller and used
it until the concern disposed of its re
tail business some time ago. Since
then the big coal pockets have not
been used. It was at the suggestion
of Kenneth W. McNeil, president of
The Archibald McNeil & Sons, Inc.,
that Commissioners John A. Hurley,
Robert D. Goddard and Louis F.
Schwerdtle of the board of education
decided to try the experiment of buy
ing coal direct from the mines, in
stead of from local dealers through
the board of contract and supply.
Part of the plan was to store about
1,200 tons in the coal pockets of the
McNeil company and deliver it to the
schools as required.
At the Salts Textile Mfg. Co. office
it was said today that the McNeil
property had been purchased to ex
tend the textile business of the con
cern but it was not likely that build
ing operations would begin imme
diately and probably some arrange
ment might be made to store the
school coal on the McNeil property.
It is reported that the McNeil com
pany is the "mysterious" concern
which is seeking to locate on the
tract owned by Mary F. Whitney, in
the North End. It was also reported
today that the McNeil compay has
an option on the. property.
Mrs. .Whitney had petitioned the
common council to lay a spur track
from the New Haven railroad tracks in
Housatonic avenue through Wakeley
street and into the property. The
petition brought a storm of protest
from that section. Every property
owner in Wakeley street opposed the
plan. Despite the fact that the spur
track would take up most of the street,
Alderman Malcolm F. MacFayden,
chairman of the streets and sidewalks
committee, favored the plan and the
common council reported favorably on
the petition.
Before the public utilities commis
sion at Hartford, however, Carl Foster,
attorney for Mrs. Whitney, found an
obstacle. The commission refused to
consider the matter unless Mr. Foster
would tell what corporation was to
locate on the property. Attorney Fos
ter said he did not know but that a
large corporation was to locate 'there,
but that it would not purchase the
property unless Mrs. Whitney could
assure them, the concern, that the
privilege of the spur track would be
granted.
President McNeil of the company
denied today that his concern has an
option on the property or contemplated
locating there. F. A. Whitney, son of
the owner of the Whitney tract, said
he knew of no option the McNeil Co.
had secured. He said his mother and
D. Fairchild Wheeler of the Bridge
port Land & Title Co. alone know
the name of the "great corporation"
which is anxious to take Mrs. Whit
ney's land provided it can get a city
street for nothing. Mrs. Whitney will
not tell the name o"f the concern and
at Mr. Wheeler's office today it was
said he was out of town.
