State Department To Send

Demanding Equal Rights
For All Americans
HAS BEEN GATHERING
DATA FOR MONTHS
British Stand Deemed D's

ment Has Plenty Of Prece
dent For Demands
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. July 18. Informa
tion gathered in an investigation
which has been in prepress for sev
eral weeks probably will be incor
porated by the state department in
vigorous representations to the Lon
don foreign offics objecting to the
placing of individuals and firms domi
ciled in the United States on the
blacklist promulgated under the trad
ing with the enemy act.
Restrains Commerce i
Although the British government in
its last communication Vo the United j
States upon the subject, declares the I
act was "purely domestic legislation j
to restrict the activities and trade of j
persons under their lurisdiction," the 1
investigation made by the state de-
partment is said to have convinced the j
Officials that in reality It operates to I
restrain American ?orciiuerce.
Overwhelming Data
The department's invesMfation has
been conducted m various sections of
the world. A mass )f iaia has been,
obtained. In Siani oni American firm
was informed tha it would appear
upon the blacklist if it had business
dealings with a German firm.
Expected For Months
Publication of a blacklist for Amer
ica came as no surpris- to the state
department, which has been watching
the situation closely. Although with
holding comment until officially no
tified of the development, irony of
ficials are known to fee! that it is
no concern of Great Britain's if firms
in the United States or their branch
es abroad desire to trade with Ger
man firms in tther countries and
while Great Britain mlsht have the
right to specify what merchandise
should be carried by her ow ships,
she has no riht to take discrimin
atory action aeainst the American
concerns because of the business they
Precedent Galore.
This position is said by those who
know, to b amplv backed by preced
ent Great Brita'n herself having made
objections to attempts to injure the
trade of an epmv at the expense 'if
neutral. Thes nfliciMs reeard it as
clearlv established hy international
law that the output of a German con
cern or even Gorian controlled cor
nnrafin in the United States is to
be regarded as having the same sttns
as the product of an American estab

and the jo'nt hirh commissions have

Navy Bill Passes
Senate; Conference
Fight Expected
Measure Favoring Eight Cap

position From Members Of
The Lower House
(By Review Leased Wire.)
i WASHINGTON, July 18. The en
larged naval building program recom
mended by the naval committee after
conference with President Wilson
and Secretary Daniels, was approved
by the senate today by a viva voce
vote. Democratic and Republican
leaders worked together to secure
its passage and although a small
group of senators from both sides of
the chamber opposed It during de
bate, sentiment in its favor was so
overwhelming that no roll call was
demanded.
With the important building section
out of the way, administration lead
ers believe the naval bill can be
pressed to a final vote tomorrow and
sent to conference, where a stubborn
fight is expected. The program ap
proved today provides for constroc-
"on or four Dattie cruisers ana iour
dreadnaughts in 1917 and a total of
17 war vessels of all classes within
the next three years. As It passed
the house, the bill authorized only
five capital ships, all battleships, for
next year and made no provislbn for
a continuing policy,
By a vote of 48 to 18 the senate
today rejected an amendment de-
signed to provide that three of the
new battleships tj be constructed in
the next three years should be kept
in Pacific coast waters.
With the exception of the region of
Longueval and south of the Somme,
at Biaches, relative calm prevails on
the fighting front in France.
The BritifJi and Germans are en
gaged in a sanguinary conflict in the
region of the Longueval salient, to the
northwest of Combles. With the
clearing of the weather, the German3
have taken the aggressive here after
a preliminary bombardment in which
a new asphyxiating gas shell was
used. At last accounts no decision
had been reached in the battle.
To the south of Somme the French
and Germans are still at grips at Bia
ches, where the French have driven
out the Germans from some of the
houses they held , in tJie village. The
Germans failed on Tuesday to renew
their attacks between Biaches and La
Maisonette, in which the French in
flicted heavy casualties on them Mon

Their Deaths Costly

equipped himself with a pis'cl and a
riflle. bis spouse strapped on another
belt and armed herself with a rifle.
She fired the first shot at a neighbo.
on the other side of the fence, 'iclped
to barricade the house when the po
lice came, and with her rifle helped
to hold it for three and one half hours.
In the end she died with him. She
was riddled with bullets and the top
of her head blown off. When Police
man Edward Hughes entered the
house he found her dead, crumpled up
in the wreckage on the floor. Mcln-
! tyre, already wounded, was rasping
and leaning against the ice box. He
j turned and the policeman sent a bul
; let Into his brain.
Three Police Shot
I This shot terminated the most x
I citing episode on the West Side in
years. One policeman is dead and
two others injured. Mrs. Josephine
Overmeyer's body had been dragged
j from Mclntyre's yard into her home
anil those of Edward Kpox and Al-
cd Mathews, negroes, living in near-
by houses, lay on their respective
front porches where Mclntyre's ac
curate pistol practV-e had taken their
lives. Knox's wife. Sadie, was in a
hospital with a bullet in her hack, and
the two wounded policemen were hav
ing arms and legs dressed.
Trains Respect Bullets
Iassenger trains, stalled for hour
on a nearby traik out of respect for
flying bullets, resumed running, and.
the crowd of thousands attracted by
f-e hundreds or shots and tlie dyna
miting of the building, was d'spersed.
Old Time Freak
Mclntvre. a stocky negro, very
black, had been regarded as queer for
years. In 1912 Judge Charles S. Cut
ting, sitting in the probate court, was
warned that a negro for some un
known reason, had designs on his life.
When the former appesred baili.Ts
pounced on him and took a large
knife away frcm him. He denied anv
wrong intentions, and was permitted
to go free. He bore a grudge, fre
quently expressed, against the police
and when threatened from time to
time by offended neighbors with ar
rest, is said to have answered that he
would never be taken alive.
Turns "Prophet
Some time during the heat of the
July night. Mclntyre's mania became
acute. He wrote two letters one on
a sheet of brown wrapping paper, and
i the other on a piece of yellow window
shade. They were ill-stielled and
rambling but they made it plain that
the negro considered himself a pro
phet a Messiah and that he had to
die In order to take his report to te
Almighty.
Then Starts Shooting
These written, the husband and
wife armed themsevles. Mrs. Mcln
tyre fired on Mrs. Wm. Blanchard. a
negress. who was feeding her chick
ens in an adjoining yard. This was
the beginning. Mclntyre, armed with
an automatic pistol, appeared on the
back porch. Mrs. Overmeyer came
on the scene looking for her husband
who had been attracted bv the shots.
Mclntyre took careful aim and she
fell dead. He then went to the front
of the house where Knox and his
