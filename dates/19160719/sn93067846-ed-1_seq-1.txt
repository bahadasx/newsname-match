Death of Negro at Lynchburg Only Casualty Reported from
Storm in this Section. Many Trees and Fences Blown
Down and Houses Unroofed. Mayor Jennings' Residence
Suffers. Tree Falls on Residence on Sumter Street.
I
The storm that struck Sumter
early Friday morning was one of the
severest which has swept over this
section in years and, coming as it did
A'hen the crops were at a critical stage,
its damage will be heavy for the]
farmers of the central, part of South!
Carolina.
Only one casualty has been report?
ed in this section of the State. This
is of a negro at Lynchburg, who is re?
ported to have been killed by a fell?
ing tree some time yesterday. Efforts
to communicate with Lynchburg by
telephone today were unavailing, as
the lines were reported down.
The wind which struck Sumter early
In the morning and gradually in?
creased to storm violence came from
a little to the east of north and
greatest velocity seemed to have beon
reached about noon. It continued
from this northerly direction until
about 4:30 in the afternoon when it
shifted around and for several hoiirs
longer blew from the south. During
the day the rain fell continuously M a
heavy deluge and all persons going*on
the streets were soaked ,it being ^Im?
possible to keep from getting wet.1 as
the wind whipped the rain aronnd
with such force. f J;
The wind's strength resulted >in
much ..amage in the city and throjyK
out the surrounding country. Jtthy
trees were blown down, a numlMfel
houses were unroofed or partiaUTj?*^
covered, fences were laid fiat anjB |pa
< wars ruined, in. sowas i^ioiel'M^BP
wind and rain.
While the damage to houses, fences
and from falling trees Is considerable
the great bulk of the damage has
been to the growing crops: Corn has
just been laid by, or was just ready for
laying by, and the stalks with their
young ears were broken off or blown
down to the ground. The. damage to
the corn crop alone will mean a loss
oi thousands of dollars .to Sumter
county alone, while In adjoining coun?
ties' the damage will be just as severe.
Little of the c?rn in this tender stage
will cvqr recover and the crop has
been cut short, when indications were
that this section of tho State would
have its largest crop. How much the
loss will amount to It is impossible to
suy now, for future weather condi?
tions will tend to injure more seriously
or aid in bringing part of the crop
out again.
The tobacco crop is reported to be
almost a total loss. While little is be?
ing raised in the immediate vicinity of
Sumter, reports that that the leaves
were either blown in strips or the
rtalks were blown down. The tobac?
co had just reached a stage for cur?
ing and was also in a critcal sttae,
as was the corn. If the weather
changes, it is possible that some of the
tobacco may yet be saved.
Cotton has also suffered seriously.
Much of the larger cotton has been
blown about ,the limbs broken off and
the stalks bruised causing much in
Jury. While the damage to cotton
has not been as heavy as to corn and
tobacco, as it yet has time to recover
to a great extent, it will shorten the
crop in the county to a great extent.
Fences have been blown down all
about the city a 1 many of them have
been knocked down by falling trees,
which are down all about the city.
Only in two instances has damage to
buildings been heard of from falling
trees. An oak on West Liberty In fall?
ing scraped against Mayor Jennings
residence and did some damage to the
side piazza roof. On South Sumter
street a largo oak tree fell across part
of one of the Schwartz houses, caus?
ing considerable damage to the build?
ing. Tho tin from the roof of the old
Masonic hall occupied by tho Craig
Furniture Company was blown off and
several Instances havo been reported
when portions of tho roofs of buildings
have been i blown away.
Trains Hcluycd by High Water.
This morning A. C. I*. trains Nos. f>2
and 51 were delayed and had not ar?
rived several hours after they "were
due, their delay being caused by high
water. It was stated that it was im?
possible to say when they would ar?
rive, as the extent of the damage to
the track and road bed was not
known, the wires of the road being
down and it being impossible to find
out anything of the damage. Train
No 52 from Charleston was delayed
by high water near Wilson's Mill.
Train No. 52 from Florence was de?
layed by a weakening of tho trestle at
Black Creek between Ebenezer and
Tlmmonsvllle. Assistance has been
sent, but when the damage will be
repaired and tho trestle made safe for
crossing is problematical.
No news has come in today from
Charleston, the wires between there
and Sumter being still down and it be?
ing therefore impossible to get any
connections.
Cleaning up Debris.
This morning Supervisor White set
all of his street force to work on
the streets cleaning up the debris
from the storm. The streets were
covered with twigs and limbs from
the strees and the street gang was en?
gaged in raking these up and the
carts hauled them off. At the same
time men were employed In cutting
up the trees which had fallen in the
streets and removing them, so as to
reopen to traffic the streets which had
been blocked, or partially so.
; h.. All of yesterday part of the city
was without electric current, the wires
.having been knocked down by the
; falling trees and it was not until late
; in. the day that the damage was re
JAired aifd the wires put back in ser

.PIERCE GERMAN SECOND LINE.
British Follow up Artillery Fire With
Infantry Attacks, Driving Germans
Back.
London, July 14.?Driving forward
with the momentum of a battering
ram the British have broken the Ger?
man second line of defenses on a
four mile front in the Somme region
It is ollicially announced. The Ger?
man positions were bombarded for
twenty-four hours before the infan
tfy attacks commenced. The British
then moved forward in irresistible
waves, overrunning the blasted
trenches. Between the Ancre and
Sommo rivers the Brit- ? pressure
concentrated along th< Albcrt-Ba
paume road. The Germans in front
of Bapaume, which was the British
objective, were under orders to light to
the death, but were unable to check
the English. Fighting of a furious
character took place northeast of
Mamctz wood, where the Germans
tried to halt the British. At this point
the British approached most closely to
an Important road running through
Combles in a northerly direction,
bisecting the Bray-Bapaume and the
Albert-Bapaume roads. Fighting
along the entire front continues.
HUMORS OF PEACE OVER?
TURES.
Petrograd, July 14.?The rumored
reasons that the Czar has called tho
cabinet to meet him at Held head?
quarters is to prepare to receive peace
overtures from the AiiHtrians. No oth?
er reason can be found for such a
meeting today. Battles continue with
great stubbornness In Volhynia, where
the Germans are trying to save Kovel,
and along Strypa, where the Austrlans
are trying to check the advance on
Lemberg.
Hard Fighting on Somme Front.
Berlin, July 14.?Furious lighting is
going on on the Somme front at
Mamctz and in the Trones wood. The
first attacks were repulsed, but the
British made a new assault, which the
Cermans are trying to break.
Atlanta, July 14.?A sixty-four mile
gale is sweeping over Georgia and
youth Carolina last night and today.
Extensive damage has been done,
particularly at Charleston, where the
telephone and telegraph wires were
destroyed and the city Isolated. Waves
over the sea wall set barges adrift at
Savannnh. Negro fishermen were
Carried OUt to sea anil drowned. The |

PEE DEE FEELS STORM'S FORGE
HIGH WIND AND HAIN CAUSE
MUCH DAMAGE.
Believed That Crops Have Been Se?
verely iHurt?Many Trees Blown
Down in Florence.
Florence, July 14.?The tropical
I storm which so suddenly swept in on
the southeast Atlantic coast early last
evening struck this section shortly
before midnight last night and grew
in Intensity as the night passed until
today it is sweeping the Pee Dee sec?
tion with hurricane proportions. The
wind was accompanied by torrential
rains that did heavy damage to busi?
ness houses and residences. The water
was driven through the roofs and
sides of the buildings and through
every crevice, so that hundreds of
buildings are soaked with water.
The streets of Florence are a mass
of uprooted and broken trees and
broken telegraph, electric and tele?
phone wires and cables and many
buildings are damaged from wind.
So far no person has been reported
as being injured but the streets and
roads are almost impassable from
fallen trees and limbs while many
bridges have been washed away. The
storm at 4 o'clock this afternoon had
not abated in force or in rainfall with
little prospect for an early letup. It
will take almost a week to clear the
streets of Florence from trees and
rubbish caused by the storm.
A large elm in front of the home of
Mayor Barrlnger was uprooted and
fell on his residence, but did little
damage. The lovely shade trees on
Kirby and Colt streets, two of the
most attractive residence streets in
the State, are wrecked beyond recog?
nition.
As yet no reports have been receiv?
ed from the rural districts and the
damage outside of the city can not be
given, other than to say that crops
have suffered erormously, especially
corn and tobacco, the former being
laid by and the latter just ready for
gathering.
Train No. 80 from the south over
?She Atlantis ?Ooeat Una, reasfee^Ugfet,
ence from Charleston about four
I hours late, being delayed on account
of telegraph poles and wires and
trees lying across the tracks between
I Mount Holly and Florence. The train
crew said that the storm seemed to be
worse hereabout than to the south of
Florence. They said that they were
delayed little between Savannah and
Charleston and Charleston and Mount
Holly, but struck trouble after leav?
ing Mount Holly. They lost consider?
able time between Lanes and Flor?
ence where the most of the trouble
seemed to be, which is some evidence
that the section of the coast around
Georgetown has suffered.
Some uneasiness is felt for the Flor
I ence colony on Pawley's Island near
I Georgetown, as nothing has been
{heard from that section.
HORRY COUNTY LOSS HEAVY.
/ _
Ter rille Wind and Rain Storm Brings
Great Damage to Crops.
Con way, July 14.?Moving in a
general westerly direction at the rate
of from 40 to 50 miles per hour, a
terrific rain and wind storm swept
Horry county last night and today,
leaving devastation and destruction
in its wake. During the climax of
the gale trees were torn from their
roots, outhouses turned topsy-turvy,
windows shattered, telephone lines
put out of commission, debris scat?
tered helter-skelter and traffic halted.
The cotton, corn and tobacco crops
between Conway and the coast are
practically a total loss, while those in
the upper section of the county were
heavily damaged. From reports no
lives have been lost, but communica?
tion with the remote sections of the
county Is still cut off.
The storm broke over the coast yes?
terday afternoon about 3 o'clock and
was ?tili In process late this after
Boon, but gradually abating. The
wind was accompanied by a terrific
downpour more than four inches of
rain falling within 2i hours. The
storm was worst at Myrtle Beach,
1 where it wrought considerable damage
to property. The water came to
within a few feet of the cottages
which caused quite a considerable
amount of uneasiness among the cot?
tagers, most of whom returned to
Conway this morning. The windows
on the Winward side of the Myrtle
Beach hotel were shattered* While
small outhouses on the beach were
overturned.
A largo percentage of the fruit of
the cotton crop was beaten off by
the high Wind and rain. Tobacco was
torn up Very badly and in many sec?
tions it Is estimated at n total loss.
The corn crop especially near the
coast was considerably broken up and

HEAVY STORM HITS DARLINGTON
Severest Known in Years Believed lo
Have Caused Much Damage to
Crops.
Darlington, July 14.?The severest
wind storm that has been known In
Darlington for years struck here this
morning and blew steadily for most
of the day with a heavy downpour of
rain throughout the entire time. As a
result trees, fenees and electric wires
are down all over the town and in
some instances the trees destroyed are
among the best that the town had of
the Darlington oak variety. There
have been no casualties reported,
though farmers around the town are
very blue, many of them holding ths
opinion that crops have been almost
completely ruined, both of cotton and
corn. In many places the streets have
almost been blocked by fallen trees
and telephone connections with neigh?
boring towns have been cut off.
At f? o'clock this afternoon the wind
w:is still blowing but with not as much
force as two or three hours earlier.
The rain, however, continued to fall. ?
