Hector, Wi dh 142 Aboard, Disabled
in Terrific Storm-All Saved.
Charleston, July 14.-The largo
naval collier Hector, carrying GO
marines in addition to her crew of
?0 men and 12 officers, sank off Char
elston late to-day. The tug Vigilant
tried to go to the Hector's assistance.
The steamer Alamo had been stand
ing by the collier, having responded
to her calls when tho collier was dis
abled some 15 0 miles off hore in last
night's hurricane.
Capt. Hunt, of tho Vigilant, was
nuable to got within less than throe
miles of the Hector, and conditions
were such that no wireless report
could, be obtained from the Alamo.
Destroyer in Trouble,
From the steamer Aropahoe, which
arrived here to-day, came tho report
that a torpedo boat destroyer was
being towed in by a tug. It was not
known what damage had been done
to the destroyer. The Arapahoo do
scribed the destroyer as "No. 25."
Tho Hector left Port Royal for
Santo Domingo, carrying the marine
recruits for United States forces in
Santo Domingo and Cuba. She at
tempted to put Into the port when
the storm dlsnblod her, but, accord
ing to Capt. Hunt, was unable to
get further than to within about 9 V6
miles from tho Charleston lightship
before she sank. Capt..Hunt said a
part of the collier's superstructure
remained above water. The Hector
displaced 11,200 tons and was built
at Sparrow's Point, Md., in 1908.

Charlotte, July 16.-Eighteen men
-14 construction officials and em
ployees of tho Southern railway, and
four linemen of tho Western Union
Telegraph Company-are missing to
night and aro oither drowned or ma
rooned In trees on the Catawba river,
about 12 miles from Charlotte. The
river is rising rapidly. The men were
swept Into the river late to-day when
the Southern railway's malu Hue
bridge wns washed away. The known
missing are: H. P, Griffin, road su
pervisor; Jos. A. Killian, resident en
gineer; S. Barbee, section fore
man, Charlotte; lt. O. Thompson,
section foreman, Belmont; W. L.
Fortune, section foreman King's
Mountain; G. C. Kale, H. C. Gully,
C. W. Kluttz, derrick men, and J. N.
Gor8on, car Inspector, Charlotte; A.
B. Blackwell, Western Union line
crew boss, and three linemen; five
negro laborers.
What aro said to be the worst
floods ever known in the Catawba
and Broad rivers to-day had dono
damage that will run into the hun
dreds of thousands of dollars In the
territory within a radius of BO miles
north and west or Charlotte. The
bridge workers under Jos. A. Killian
went down with the Southern's main
line bridge at Belmont, just out or
Charlotte, late to-day. Five or six
or the men are reported to have been
caught in the tops ol" trees and res
cued.
Just above the Southern bridge,
the Piedmont and Northern interur
ban bridge was washed away. Far
ther up the river, near Mooresvllle
and Statesvllle, two highway bridges
went out, while at Catawba the
Southern's bridge on the Salisbury
A8bevllle line was washed away.
At Mondo, below Catawba, tho
West Mondo cotton mill ot 5,000
spindles ls under water, and the East
Mondo mill, across the river, is al
most submerged, while a cotton ware
house with 4 00 bales of cotton has
been washed away. Still farther up
the Catawba, the Lilladaun and Ais
baugh mills are under water
The damage to the mills is laid to
a Waterspot in Alexander county,
which ettfMfcd a section of the earth
embankment of tho Lookout Shoals
Power Company to give away to-day,
adding 15 foet of water to the al
ready more than 20-foot tide in the
Catawba. That volume of water also
caused the last two or three of the
bridges to go.
Near Winston-Salem, the town of
Rondo was cut off from the outside
world lor several hours until a tele
graph operator, driven ont of hi? of
fice, carried his instruments to a high
hill and cut in on a telegraph wire.
Trains cannot be gotten to North
Wilkosboro and will not be operated
west of Donnagha to-morrow, be
cause or the tide on the Yadkin
river, which is 8% reet higher than
known in 43 years. A Southern rail
way train, supposed to have left
North Wilkesboro yesterday after
noon, has not been heard from, while
ono that started from Winston-Salem
to that town has had to stop at Elk in.
Residents of Jonesville and adjacent
towns nre moving to high lands.
Four Saved, Hopes for Others.
Charlotte, N. C., July 17.-Rescu
ers to-day brought In Engineer Jos.
Killian and three other employees of
the Southern raliway who had boen
lodged in trees in the Catawba river
a milo 'below where tho railroad
bridges wont down with them.
Searching parties are seeking the
other men who were on the bridges
when it went. down.
lt was hoped the other eleven rail
way employees swept away yesterday
with a bridge would he saved later in
the day. A tree holding some of the
men was swept down early to-day
and the men carried away. Four
employees of the Western Union Tel
egraph Company are also reported
lost. The river is falling slowly.
Reports from every section con
t i lined to add to tho property dam
age. The Sou ?hern railway bridge
near Rock Hill was swept away. De
struction of this eu ts off all traffic
southward over th? Southern lines.
Trains a^e being detoured over the
Seaboard Air Lino by way of Monroe,
out reports state thai a bridge on
that line is in danger and probably
will be condemned.
Worst. In History-Receding.
Raleigh, N. C., July 17.-Flood
waters which Bwopt. parts of North
Carolina. South Carolina, Virginia,
Tennessee and Wost Virginia yester
day, taking a toll of at least nine
lives, rendered hundreds of persons
homeless and doing property damage
variously' estimated at from ton to
fifteen millions, wore receding to-day.
Tho worst conditions obtained in
Western North Carolina, where the
flood was described ns tho most dis
astrous in the history of that section.
In South Carolina.
Tho rivers doing the greatest flood
damage are in the eastern part of the
State. In York, Union, Spartanburg
and Chesterfield counties many of the
highway bridges have been washed
away, crops badly damaged on low
lands and upland badly washed.
In Florence on Saturday ten inches
of rain fell In ten hours. Railway
traffle is badly crippled. The Atlan
tic Coast Line railway has been the
greatest financial sufferer.
In Charleston and Berkeley county
there was a general down-pour of
rain. " At Georgetown there was a
considerable storm of cyclonic pro
portions. Much damage was dono to
shipping. At Myrtle Hench the hotels
were badly damaged by wind and
rain.
lt is feared that when tho crest of
the Pied mont waters roaches Colum
bia that the city will bo overflowed.
In Oeoneo County.
The rains high np tn the mountnins
.Saturday and Sunday have again put
Seneca, Tugaloo, Chattooga and Kco
wee on tho rampage. Tugaloo was
higher Sunday and Monday than it
was during tho freshet last week.
Seneca was about four feet higher
than last Tuesday. Keoweo was up
considerably, as was also Chattooga.
In tho Jocassee section, at. the in
tersection of liastatoe and Whitewa
ter the flood was higher than since
1110(5. Croat holes were washed In
the bottoms and crops ruined. Tho
high water here ls presumed to have
been caused by tho heavy rains on
Saturday In the upper part of Dick
ens county and North Carolina. The
tide brought tn by Horso Pasture
river was very high. This ls thc
stream that converges with the river
from Lake Toxaway, North Carolina,
which was reported here Sunday as
having given way under the torrlblo
rains and high waters. This, how
ever, ls lntnct, and this great body of
water remains In hounds.
Heavy rains fell ill the eastern part
of the county Sunday afternoon. At
Walhlla the heaviest rains for the
week fell Sunday morning.
Another Oeoneo Homicide.
-Will Lattiniore was killed by

not lived in that town in six years.
He has been engaged in railroad work
in Virginia. Lattlmore was also
from Virginia. Grafton was arrested
at the Seneca depot after he had pur
chased a ticket for Virginia, nnd is
now in the Oconee Jail. An inquest
was held by Magistrate J. N. Hop
kins. lt was found that thc ball
entered Lattimore's neck from the
front and ranged through and down
the back n Bhort distance, where it
was cut out by Dr. Heller. Lattl
more lived only 15 minutes after be
ing shot. This is the second rail
road cam)) killing' for Oeoneo within
a week. The one preceding this took
place at Madison, and the murderer
seems to have made good his escape.
The police at Mount. Airy, (Ja , tele
graphed Sheriff Davis last Wednesday
that they had Will Walker, who was
wanted for this killing. Tho Sheriff
went lo Moimi Airy, but found that
the negro was not Hie o:<e he wanted

Cause of (lie Floods.
An estimated rainfall of from sis

ther aggravated when the dams hold
ing hack tho waters of Lake Osceola
at Henderson ville and Karniga Lake,
at Karniga, wero carried away, the

through tho French Broad Valley,
through Mendel Bon county, past
