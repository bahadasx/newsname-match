Premium.
Tli Mayor's proclamation, setting
npart Wednesday, Thursday and Fri
day an general clean up daya, will be
In force today.
Every oltltcn Interested In the gen
eral welfare of hia city or community
should hoed thla proclamation and
should at oner comply with the order
of the mayor. The proclamation la Is
sued as an aid to the 8tate Board of
Health, which has fawned a bulletin
calling attention to the fact the epi
demic of infantile paralysis la spread
ing over the entire land, and although
N la generally confined to Infanta and
children, older people are by no means
immune to thla disease The cauae of
the diaeaae, according to the beat
medical authorities is filth and the lack
of sanitation.
It behooves every one then to aec
that no filth or rubbish is allowed to
collect on his grounds or near hia
property. Every resident In the city
must thoroughly clean his premlaea
from every manner of trash, filth and
rubbish. Tbe city will aid In cleaning
up and will haul away trash of any
one too poor to pay for same. It will
aiao furnish lime to those who cannot
afford to buy it. The citizens who fall
to comply with thla order will be
prosecuted in the courts.
The order Js a just one and all
should aee that their premises are
spick and span for Sunday. The city
Is giving plenty of time to comply with
the proclamation. Already quite a
few have cleaned up and there are oth
ers that do not allow their property to
become cluttered up with rubbish but
haul it away as soon as it accumulates.
As yet Maysville has not been visited
by the epidemic and these precautions
should prevent its visiting this city.
Make your slogan, "Clean Up."

kindling can have same by calling at

El Paso. Texas, July 18 A party of
mounted Mexicans exchanged fire with
L Company of the Ninth Massachus
etts Infantry near here today. Ac
cording to reports the guardsmen
were doing outpost duty when the
Mexicans rode up on the opposite
bank of the Rio Orande and opened
Ore. The guardsmen suffered no cas
ualties, but reported they believed
they had killed one Mexican.
Captain Hlckey, of Dorchester.
Mass., commanding the company, esti
mated the number of Mexicans at 15,
but said be was not able to deter
mine whether they were soldiers Ap
proximately 60 ahota were fired on
each side, it was said.
Both General George Bell, Jr., com
manding the El Paso district, and
Lieutenant Colonel Leon' Buclon, act
ing garrison commander in Juaret,
denied that he had received official
reports of the Incident, and both said
that It seemed trivial.
Attack la Isolated District
The shooting occurred in an isolat
ed district about three miles down the
river from El Paso, known locally as
the "Island" section. The Massa
chusetts company waa doing border
patrol duty In this district, one third
of the 60 men being on patrol and the
remainder being held in reserve in tbe
camp about half a mile to the rear.
Captain Hlckey said that throughout
the day small parties of Mexicans ap
peared from time to time on the
Mexican bank of the river, which la
about SO yards wide at this point
Then, he aaid, a mounted detachmeut
appeared, most of the horsemen wear
ing red serapes.
The Mexicans rode up the river
bank, dismounted and deployed as
skirmishers, creeping through the
underbrush which dotted the river's
edge.
One of the Mexicana fired his rifle,
the bullet crossing the river, and, ac
cording to Private Charles Prescott
of Natlck, Mass., dropped at his feet
Screening themaelvea as much as
possible by little clumps of mesquite,
the Americans returned the Are and
by the time the reserves reached the
rjver to reinforce them they had drlV'
