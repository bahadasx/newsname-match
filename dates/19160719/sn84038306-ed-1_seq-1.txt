-W:
Lloyd, thi^twe:ve year old 6on oC ...
Curtis Hobkaday, and Mr. F. p. Ken
yon, the tenant on the Hockaday farm
had a mighty narrow, escape frota
death Friday afternoon when a bolt
of lightning'struck the load of hay
on which they were riding It appears
that Mr. Kenyon and Lloyd had been
working in the hay field and were
about to drive to the barn when thsv^
storm came. While they Were on their
way to the barn the bolt struck the
load) stricking the boy on one side
of the head, and following down his
entire body, inflicting severe burns..
His hat and clothes were badly -torn,,
and one shoe torn from his foot. At
this time the Manchester & Oneida
train was coming from Oneida, sad,
the train crew ea-w the man fall from
the load and the team tumblo over in
4 heap, and lost np time in getting?
to the injured. The boy was placed,
on a cot and .hurried to his home i®
this city, where he Is now maklag
a most, encouraging recovery. For
hours Lloyd was unconscious, hut re
gained /consciousness at midnight.
Mr. Kenyon Was severely shocked
ibv the bolt but was able to resume
his work after a few hottrs.
Tho two fine: f*rm hoises hitched'
to the wagon Vere instantly killed,
entailing a heavy loss to Mr. Hock
aday. This loss, however is not con
cerning Mr. Hockaday, so long as
his son, Lloyd's life has been
spared. It Is believed that the fact
that Mr. Kenyon and-the hoy were
on the load of hay is all that saved
both from instant death. Had they"
been walking on the wet ground near
the wagon, there every reason to
believe that both would have been in
stantly kilted.
