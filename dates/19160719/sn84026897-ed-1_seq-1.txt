JOHNSTON LETTER.
Meeting of W. C. T. U. Special
Feature of Prayer Service
Royal Ambassadors
Held Picnic.
The meeting- for July of the W.
C. T. U. was held on Friday after
noon with Mrs- J. L. Smith and the
very inclement weather prevented a
full attendance but with the few
present a good meeting was had.
The subject for the afternoon was
"Christian Citizenship," the meet
ing being led by Mrs. Mattie Den
ny and was opened with the singing
of "America". A communication was
read from the state president, Mrs.
Joseph Sprott, stating that a call
had come from the national super
intendent of work among the sol
diers and sailors to provide delica
cies for the sick among these. The
W. C. T. IL wants : the boys and
the nation to know that it is inter
ested in the nation's defenders and
this can be well demonstrated by
each union doing a little. So it was
a great pleasure to tnis union to
make a contribution. A report of
the visit to the County Home for
Jennie Casseday's birthday was giv
en by Miss Zena Payne. After the
discussion of business matters the
subject was discussed and Mrs. J.
L. Smith made a feeling prayer for
the campaign that is on, and for
our soldier boys. A selection, "Zeal
never more-needed than now" was
read by Mrs. Alonzo Horne; "His
first note" Mrs. OlinEidson; "Citi
zens in the making," Mrs. J. L.
Smith. After a few earnest words
from the president, Mrs. Denny, the
meeting closed with the Aaronic
benediction.

The prayer meeting of last Wed
nesday evening was unusually in
teresting, the pastor on Sunday pre
vious having asked all who would
to come prepared to give their fa
vorite character, one from the old
and one from the new testament, in
a sentence, telling why. The ll th
chapter of Hebrews was read and
after Rev. Brooke had made a short
talk on the characters of the Bible,
the favorite characters were given
some preferring to write their
choice on a slip of paper which Mr.
Brooke read. Each choice was writ
ten down and at the close all read
out showing which were the general
favorites.
Dr. and Mrs. Horace Wright of
Georgetown are here spending
awhile with relatives, the latter con
valescing from an attack of appen
dicitis.
The Royal Ambassadors of the
Baptist church who have for their
leaders Mesdames P. C. Stevens and
S. J. Watson planned a picnic for
last Friday, this to be at YTonce's
pond, bu? the day proved a very
rainy one and although the outing
was held, very few of the pleasures
arranged could be enjoyed. The
rain did not dampen the spirits of
some and they strolled about the
woods and enjoyed the waters of
the large pond. The rain had no
effect upon the picnic hour and the
old mill was a very festive scene for
awhile and a feast of good things
was enjoyed. The wind and heavy
rain forced all to return at an early
hour.

dozen crates, some fifty or more,

"UNCLE IV" AGAIN
Will Hear Rev. G. W. Bussey
Preach One Week. Inter
esting Letter From Mr.
H. H. Scott.
Dear Advertiser: If I should
make a lot of mistakes in thia, just
say well, old "Uncle Iv" has some
thing on his mind a little different
from the usual state, and so I have.
A card received from Rev. G. W.
Bussey saying he is to preach for
us the week following the 4th Sun
day in this month. Yes, God will-1
ing, I will be permitted once more |
to be with him in a week's meeting.
It seems most too good to be true,
and next week will be a long week
to me.
It is still raining-only one day
and a half to plow this week- A
heavy rain last night and ground
boggy. Lots of old cotton dyinj
with wilt or black root.
. Julian, I send you another letter j
from H. H. Scott and have replied.
Now some may think that the inci-j
ident of no importance (and they)
may not be) but these incidents will
never be in history and the people
pf this day will never know of
them unless told by the old soldier.

Dear Uncle Iv and Comrade: I

piece in The Advertiser about the

best of me. But they didn't do it.

from the house. Well, I will say
to you I took supper with 4 Yankee
?cavalrymen one night at a farm
house in North Carolina. I rude up j
to the house by myself after dark
and found 4 horses hitched at the
fence. I saw that, they were eating
supper and I decided to go in and
take supper with them. I laid my
double-barrel 6hot gun down where
I hitched mj horse. I went into tbs
house with, the determination if

"Boys I am just in time. I will take
supper with you." The old citizen
who was waiting on the table said
to me "Take a seat at the table." I
asked him if he had anything to
drink and he said, "Yes, come up
to the sideboards. Here is some
corn whiskey and apple jack." I
took a good pull and sat down to
supper. He had a cold boiled ham
on tho table and you know" that a
Johnnie Reb likes ham. The Yan
kees asked me what command I be
longed to. I told them that \I was
one of Kilpatrick's scouts and only
stopped to get a little infrmation
about a road running parallel with j
the one I was on. (I had .inst left it)
but got what information that I
wanted from the citizen. I asked
him if any rebels was on that road.
He said that he didn't know. I told
him I will go and see. There were
t~o beds in the room and I asked
him to put a pallet down on the
floor as I would/ come back and
spend the night. He said that he
would do so and I told the Yankees
to put the candle and matches on
the mantlepieoe where I could find
them and I got a canteen full of
apple brandy from him and left. I
did not do like Sam Roper, hunt up
Dr. Taylor to cure me. I went back
about two miles where I had left
about 8 of my comrades and told
them what I had done and give
them all a smile and my canteen.
We proposed to go back and get
them when we got to where I left
the Yankees. I told them to get
down and hitch their horses and
wait until I light the candle and
then come in. Thc Yankees had
gone to bed. After I had lit the
candle I told the Yankees to get up
and put your clothes on as you were
prisoners. They looked at me and
said you are the man that took snp
per with us. Yon told us that you
was Kilpatrick's scout. Yes I said
but I am Wade Hampton's scout
now. We carried in to Gen Hamp
ton at that time 75 horses on that
trip. And in conclusion will say I
have addressed you as a comrade. I
don't call all ex-conrederates com:
rades. I call a man a comrade that
did his duty as he saw it We had
men in company I and when our or

for duty they would call out I am

rived cards and pencils were dis
tributed by Lois Dobson aad Elea
nor Miras for progressive conversa
tion. For nearly two hours this
proved to be very pleasant diver
sion, partners being changed at the
expiration of each period of five
minutes. Electric lights were ar
ranged about the spacious lawn and
it was originally planned by the
hostess to have those who engaged
in the progressive conversation
pass the time promenading upon the
lawn and about the grove but the
continuous falling of rain precluded
the possibility of this feature.
The hostess served ice cream and
cake to her guests.

Better Things in Charleston.
It depends on the viewpont as to
what is good or bad; but everybody
in Charleston who wants a clean and
sober city says that there has been
a wonderful improvement down
there within the last 18 months.
Among the achievements may be
recalled :
The confiscation of a ship with
its cargo of contraband.
The bankrupting of a brewery.
The cloning of gambling dens and
liquor shops by^the hundreds. .
The collection of Si,925 in fines
from blind tigers at a sessions
court-enough to pay the entire ex
penses of the court and over, and
this in a city where 18 months ago
grand juries refused to find true
bills in blind tiger cases no matter
what the evidence was.
Charleston has been made a better
city for men, women and children
to live in. Isn't that worth while?
