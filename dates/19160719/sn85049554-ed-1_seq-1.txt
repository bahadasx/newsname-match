Weather Handicaps Operations.
Adverse weather Is compelling a lull
in the fighting on the western front.
Military critics taking stock of the
situation are surprised by the large
captures of heavy armament which
General Sir Douglas Haig, the British
commander-in-chief announced. They
point out how British attacks have
been pressed with greatest rapidity In
order to give the Germans no time to
organize for the defenses.
Also, as was evidenced by the with
drawal of the British from the Four
eaux wood, where they had reached
the German third line, General Haig
wisely resisted the temptation to hold
4 onto that point. It would have meant
severe fighting, with probably heavy
losses.
Evidence received from the front
seems to prove that obstacles are like
ly to be less difficult as the entente
allies advance.
With regard to the eastern front,
General von Llnsingen's retirement
across the Lipa is considered by critics
as removing the last serious obstacle
to the advance of the Russians toward
Lemberg.
Russians Enter-Hungary.
The Bussians have penetrated a
day's march into Hungary, says an

Paris, July 19.—One of the most strik

IVench soldiers. The fort had resisted

But the Germans, taken unaware,

TWO REQI M'feNTS RIDDLE tl.
British Pay Honor to 126 Surviving
German Heroes,
Paris. July 19.—The capture of Ovil
lers by the British necessitated one of
the most sanguinary encounters of the
advance, wires a correspondent of the
Llberte.
Nevertheless the British were well
rewarded for their effort, for they
gained possession of the broad highway
leading from Albert to Bapaume.
The village was defended for ten
days by two regiments of the Prussian
guard. The correspondent says that of
these regiments only 126 men survived
and all of these were captured.
It was at Ovillers that the British of
fensive, which began July 1. was held
up while the remainder of the line was
advancing. From July 7 on the village
Was cut off almost completely from the
German rear, but it was not until July
14 that the desperate resistance of the
Prussian guard was overcome.
The defenders of the town suffered
from hunger and thirst, as the British
curtain of fire prevented the bringing
up of fresh supplies. Some of the Ger
mans are reported to have been
poisoned by drlnkipg polluted water
from a pond and others to have been
driven mad by the bombardment.
When the survivors left the village
as prisoners the British presented
arms in recognition of the bravery ot
their defense.

G. 0 P. MEETING
Republicans of Iowa Meet
In Convention at Des
Moines.
SACRIFICES .FRIENDS
TO PURCHASE PEACE
Reasonably Dry Plank and Fairly Good
Roads—Declaration Secured in Plat­
form— Havner's Nomination, at Ex
pense of Wilson, the Wete Candidate.
Completes Deal Wilson's Scott
County Friends Plan Fight.
Special to Times-Republican.
Des -Moines, July 19.—Buying
peace at the expense of his friends
was the big transaction of the day
in this convention consummated by
Harding managers.
The result was a reasonable dry
plank in the platl'orhi at the ex
pense of the wet republicans and
wet democrats who had supported
him in the primaries and a fairly
good roads plank at the expense of
the tax leaguers who have waited
to abolish the highway commission.
Havner's nomination, at the ex
pense of Wilson, the wet candidate,
was the last deal to buy peace with
the drys.
Last /night when the deal was
made to appease the enemy, the
places on the committee on resolu
tions were conceded to such drys
as Joe Allen, Senator Saunders, of
Council Bluffs, and Senator Van
Law, of Marshalltown, and word
went out that the platform would
be drier than the democratic plat
form.
Then It became apparent that the
tax leaguers were not going to be
permitted to abolish the highway
commission. Senator Berry, of In
d'anola, was dumped over by Judge
"Bradshaw, a Harding booster from
Polk county, for the express pur
pose of keeping the platform free
from reaction on the road question.
How to deliver to Havn^r was a
problem, for wet delegates are not
easy to handle. In Havner's con
gressional district the wets from
Scott were delivered by the adop
tion of a unit rule in the district
caucus, which permitted lead--,
ers to vote wets, for Havner who
would have stayed at home rather
than meet such a fate. Hughes,
Harding a,nd harmgny has given
place to (He* Hughes,' Harding and
Havner slogan.
Des Moines, July 19.—Republicans of
Iowa met here in convention today to
draft a platform and to name candi
dates for attorney general and rail
road commissioner. There warn an in
dication early in the day that the fac
tional differences had been threshed
out in caucuses and that the conven
tion would be harmonious
Republican leaders who had been in
conference for the greater portion of
the night were confident that harmony
would rule at the state convention to
day. It was said at the opening that
most of the contests to be fought out
in the district caucuses had been set
tled amicably and'that arrangements
were made to rush thru a harmony
slate, especially with regard to the new
state central committee.'
There was little delay in calling the
convention to order, as district caucuses
held delegates during the early morn
ing hours. When the convention was
called to order it was predicted that
the convention would be devoid of fac
tional troubles, that Havner and Guiher
would be named candidates for attor
ney general and railroad commission
er, respectively, and that the platform
would contain a strong prohibition
plank and a declaration for good
roads.
The keynote address, delivered by
W. Garrett, temporary chairman, con
tained an uncompromising declaration
of prohibition, a declaration for a
stronger foreign policy both as regards
Mexico and the rest of the world, and
declarations for good roads, amend
ment of. the primary law, woman's
suffrage and against militarism.
[Trie text of Mr. Garrett's address
will be found on page 2, of this is
sue.—Ed.]
Believe Harmony Will Rule.
Resolutions, drawn up tentatively
last night by W. L. Harding, guberna
torial candidate, and his lieutenants,
were ready for submission to the re^
olutions committee as soon as It is
formed. It was said to be virtually cer
tain that this committee will ratify
the tentative draft and that a plat
form will Include plans providing for
prohibition and good roads, with em
phasis placed on a proposition to leave
the initiative in the
vmatter
of the good
roads to the farmer tax payers.
Havner Apparently Winner.
As a caucus progressed there was a
conviction among politicians that H. M.
Havner, of Marengo, would be chosen
as candidate for attorney general over
George H. Wilson, of- Des Moines. It
was said that .Mr. Harding had thrown
his support to Havner for political rea
sons and thd other leaders, many of
whom favored Wilson personally, were
subordinating their^interests to what
they considered the* good of the party,
and would vote for Havner. The result
of the balloting for the nomination,
which will not be reached until late
this afternoqn, will, in the opinion of
leaders, be very close. Proponents of
Wilson's candidacy refuse to admit
Havner's advantage and claim victory
for Wilson by a small Margin.

Wilson's Friends to Fight.
As the time for the reconvening of
the convention after luncheon ap
proached, the Havner-Wilson contest
assumed a more serious aspect than
ever. There was a rumor that the Scott
county delegation from the Second dis
trict might bolt the unit rule and lead
an effort to stampede the convention
for Wilson. There was no confirmation
of this but leaders admitted that such
a plan might prove effective.
As delegates poured back Into the
Coliseum spellbinders for both candi
dates fir^d verbal broadsides from op
posite corners of the stase and emer
gency bands brought in at the last
minute endeavored to arouse enthusi
asm for their respective employers.
The rumored action of the Scott
coiinty delegation was considered im
portant. If such a plan was in con
templation, leaders said there was no
telling what might happen.

Chicago, July 19.—A crowd of more
than 5,000 gathered in the vicinity ot
the Mclntyre house last night, follow
ing the shooting to death of six per
sons and the wounding of Ave others
yesterday morning. Rumors reached
the police that a race riot was Imml

wreaking of vengeance against the ne
groes in the neighborhood. Captain

upon Second Deputy Schuettler for as
sistance.
As a result fifty detectives and pa
trolmen were rushed to the scAne,

were the result of brooding* «nr re
ligion and the trials of bis race. Often
his mania took the form of violent
ravings.
It was one of these attacks that
caused a warrant to be Issued for his
arrest on Monday.
A policeman went to IMdfniyre'S
homo to serve the warrant. The ofogro
was not at home. The policeman de
cided to wait until morning. His de
cision cost six lives.

morning indicate that the officers and
others hurt in the fight probably would
get well. Edward Clement, detective
sergeant was said to be in the most
serious condition.
Among the effects found In the Mc
lntyre, house after the bodies had been
removed was a letter he had written
to Prince Menelik. of Abyssinia. It
was sent in January, 1915, and re
turned unopened In April, 1916. In It
Mclntyre proposed colonizing Ameri
can negroes in Abyssinia, stating that
he "had organized a church and also
an immigration league In the name of
the Abyssinian government," altho he
knew nothing "about the country or
government, except that my father
taught me or I read In books, dear sir."
Another sentence read: "My father
taught me from childhood that A. was
my country and that King M. was my
kind of ruler there are 10 African sub
jects here who know practically nothing
aibout Africa."
Farther along he wrote: "Some of us
don't believe that tho African race has
a King, dear sir. There are thousands
of loyal Africans that are willing to
come bock to A. If our beloved king
would permit us to, O king."
