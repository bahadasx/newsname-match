things, Like other papers of the kind
In those days it printed no local news
and was mostly devoted to proceed
ings of congress and reprinted articles
from New York, Philadelphia and
foreign papers,

ANOTHER CANDIDATE WANTED

Up To Standard.
Editor of The Manner: I see one of
the Lamoille County papers claims to
have taken .1 pest card vote to find
nit the sentiment as to whether a cer
tain number of people wanted Senator
Page or Mr. Fletcher, and then they
proceed to nnnounce a vote that even
n gambler would not believe, I havt
not heard a single person speak of
that vote, but what said, "That's all
rot," or "it was carefully mailed to a
list Page sent up." Nobody believes
it ami you and I know it
Seems to nie the Important question
is not whether we will return Mr
Page, but rather who is there that
measures u; to the Senatorial stand
ard. who In Vermont can we send
that will ho well represent us that our
people and the people at large will

capable of helping to solve the great
questions of today, as they wen
solved when we had Geo. F. F.dmunds
and Senator Morrill In the senate. To
my mind this is what we are up
against, not to send Mr. Page back
just because he has served two terms
and wants to stay now that ho Is In
his dotage, is ought to he a question
of sending our best man, whoever he
In.
For one I would like to see a man of
President John M. Thomas' ability

GERMANS DENY DEFEAT
Say Their Enemies Send Out Lying
Claims.
london, Tuesday, July 18. Tho
German General Staff has Issued an
appeal to the people of Germany for
confidence in tile conduct of the war,
according to a Itotterdam dispatch to
The Daily News.
"Never has the world experienced
so stupendous as the present battles,"
says the appeal. "Never has an army
braved what ours has braved."
The appeal adds:
"The enemy is sending out every
few hours claims to have taken vil
lages, woods, and thousands of pris
oners, in reports that are no longer
couched in the language of soldiers,
Inn are fantastic hymns of victory
that mock truth, in an effort to under
mine German confidence."
THE COUNTRY NEWSPAPER
Its Humanity Expounded by a Kansas
Editor.
Our papers, our litte country pa
pers, seem drab and miserably pro
vincial to stringers; yet we who
read them read in their lines the
Sweet intimate story of life. And
all these touches of .Nature make us
wondrous kind. It i3 tho country
newspaper, bringing together daily
the threads of the town's life, weav
ing them into something rich and
strange, and setting the pattern as it
weaves, directing the loom, and giv
ing the doth its color by mixing the
lives of al the people in its color-
pot it is this country newspaper that
reveals us to ourselves, that keeps
our country hearts quick and our
country minds open and our country
faith strong.
When the girl at the glove counter
marries the boy in the wholesale
house the news of their wedding is
good for a 4o-line wedding notice,
and the 40 lines In the country paper
give them seL" respect When in due
course we Know that their baby is a
Impounder, named Grover or Theo
dore or Woodrow , we have that neigh-
lnrly feeling that breeds the real
democracy. When we read of death
in that home we can mourn with them
that mourn When we see them tnov
big upward In the world, into a firm
and out toward the country club neigh
borhood, we rejoice with theni that
rejoice. Therefore, men and breth
ren, when you are riding through this
vale of tears upon the California
Limited, and by chance puck up the
little country newspaper with Its
niejiKer telegraph service of Suoo or
! 1 words or, at least, 15,000 or
L'l'.ouO; when vou see its array of
countryside items; its interminable
local stories; its tiresome editorials
on the water works, the schools, tin
street railroad, the crops and the
city printing, don't throw down the
contemptible Ittle rag with the ver
dict that there is nothing in it. But
know this, and know it well; if you
could take the clay from your eyes
and read the little iaper as it is writ
ten you would find all of God s beauti
ful sorrowing, struggling, aspiring
world In it. and what you saw would
make yon touch the little paper with
reverent hands. William Albn

ready made, it may be stated, eight
weeks before the dates of the fair
that the tattle exhibit will tax the full

grtater number of states will lie rep
resented than al any previous state
lal.V
A change of policy will take place
in conducting the trotting events. The
stake races have been loduced to two
and It is believed t lint this chiingt
will result In better races and a great
