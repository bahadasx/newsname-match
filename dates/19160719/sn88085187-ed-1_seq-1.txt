Bay Unions Plan to
Resume Work, Anyhow
SAN FRANCISCO, July 19. —,
San Francisco's striking long-1
shoremen may resume work to
morrow, in spite of the refusal of
the longshoremen in other Pacific
toast, ports to sanction a compro
mise.
The committee of L."i Of the lo
cal union, at a meeting this after
noon, is expected to ignore the
vote of other locals.
Union longshoremen of Pugot
Sound voted unanimously Tues
day to continue the strike. San
Jjiego was the only const city, in
/act, which voted to adopt San
Kramlnco's attitude regarding a
settlement. In Seattle 7NO union
men voted to refuse to accept San
Francisco's agreement, and in Ta
eonm 600 men adopted the same
Hand.
"We are dissatisfied with the
Northern reports," declared one
official of the local union today.
"Frankly, we do not like the ref
erendum return from the unions
up there."

the Northern longshoremen on

day at the door of employers who
permit strikebreakers and guards
to "invite trouble."
"Here in Seattle," said the
mayor, ''the people probably do
not realize that we have been
dealing with the biggest strike
In the history of the city.
"It seemed to me that there
■was about the minimum amount
of trouble. In fact, there has
been no trouble at all on the

been outalde of the strike zone,

"When this present strike
started, I told the waterfront peo
ple that 1 would permit them to
have special policemen on their
property. But I insisted thut I
be permitted to pass on the men.
And I insisted that the employers
pay for the guards lined on their
own property.
"I told them that the city
would police thu streets along

quarters.
Others prophesied that the San

which the referendum \ote was
taken In Seattle, Taeoma and

A third forecast is that the
district organization of tlit- long
shoremen will accept the pro
posed compromise agreement
rather than see a split.
"If the San Francisco and Sun

determination to settle the strike
and resume work, it means a split

secretary of Tatoniu union No.

HOME COLONY! Mabel Abbot
Visits "Anarchist Settlement"
By Mabel Abbott
I slept last Saturday nigh* at
the "anarchist" colony at' Home.
For two or three days 1 had
been traveling among the bay is
lands and on that part of the
mainland which is generally
lumped with them.
During all that time 1 had been
hearing stories about the settle
ment at Home; strange, incon
gruous stories: stories that left
me utterly unable to picture tht
place to myself.
On the one liniiil, there
were stories that consisted
chiefly of hints and nods;
mysterious, sinister stories
of plots and refugees; of •-<■<■
rret organization and o|ien
iiiuii'i liy; of free love and
naked shamolesMiess.
"All the dynamiters at Home
ain't been caught yet," I was
told. "They're right there, but
they keep out of sight. And
you'll see some queer things if
you get there about bathing
time."
On the other hand, I was
assured that Home was
"just like any other place
except for a few hot-heads."
Their little farms, I was
told, were better cultivated,
their dances were more or
derly and better managed,
and their young people a
more intelligent and better
bthavod class than those of
other settlements.
Between the two sets of stories,
I did not know, when I went to
the neat little hamlet on Joe's
Bay, whether 1 was stepping fool
hardily into a mortiss of conspir
acy, or whether I was wasting
my tremors on a simple and
much-maligned country commu
nity.
FRANKLY, I DON'T KNOW
YKT.
Hut there are a few things I
do know—things I saw for my
self; and these things I can tell
In plain words, without nods and
hints and meaning glances.'
In the first place, I know, be
cause I ran across evidence of
the fact all through the Bay
islands, that the Joe's Bay Trad
ing Co. of Home, is a remarkably

organized ami managed institu
tion. I found large shippers of
produce, miles away from Joe's
Uay, who sell and buy entirely
through the company, though
their produce rocs from their
own wharves direct to Tacoma.
These men told me the company
pays always as much, and some
times more, for produce, than the
city buyers. I found farmers,
