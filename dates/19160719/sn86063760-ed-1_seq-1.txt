ESTIMATE LOSS $10,000,000
Five Known Dead in Asheville and
Bittmore.-Western North Carolina
Hit Hard.-Power Lines Wrecked.
Charlotte.--Serious floods in North
Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia
Sunday caused five known deaths
with 18 others known to be missing
and rendered hundreds homeless, dam
aged property and crops to the exteni
of $10,000,000 according to first esti
mates and demoralized railway, tele
graph and telephone communications.
Following the huricane that struck the
South Atlantic Coast unprecedented
rains have fallen, driving rivers and
smaller streams from tneir banks and
imperilling many lives.
What are said to be the worst
floods ever known in the Catawba,
Broad and Yadkin Rivers did untold
damage in the territory within a ra
dius of 50 miles of Charlotte with the
possible loss of 18 lives.
Just above the Southern bridge,
over the Catawba at Balment, the
Piedmont & Northern Interurban
bridge and the Seaboard Air Line
Railroad bridge at Mount Holly were
washed away Sunday afternoon and
night. Farther up the river, near
Mooresvile and Statesville, two high
way bridges went out, while at Ca
tawba, the Southern's bridge on the
Salisbury-Asheville line, was washed
away.
At Monbo, below Catawba. the
West Monbo Cotton Mill or 5,000 spin
.dles, is under water and believed to
have been washed away, and the Eas't
Monbo Mill, across the river, is prac
ticanly submerged. while a cotton
warehouse with 400 bags of cotton has
been washed away. Still further up
the Catawba, the liledoun and Ale
paugh Mills are under water.
The damage to these mills is laid
to a waterspout in Alexander county
that caused a section of the earth
embankment of the Lookout Sheals
power plant of the Southern Power
Company to give away adding 15 feet
of water to the already more than 20
foot tide in the Catawba. That volume
of water also caused the fast two or
three of the bridges to go.
The Dravo Power Company's dam
on Broad river near Shelby, went out
late Sunday afternon, menacing the
Southern Power Company's plant near
Blacksburg. S. C., and cutting off the
electric supply for Spartanburg and
the textile towns surrounding that
city. The Southern Power Company
however, may be able to meet this de
mand.
Near Winston-Salem, the town of
Rondo was cut off from the outside
world for several hours until a tele
graph operator, flooded out of his, of
flce, carried his instruments to a high
hill and cut in on a telegraph wire.
Trains cannot be gotten to North
Wilkesboro and will not be operated
west of Donagha for some time be
cause of the tide on the Yadkin river,
which Is eight and one-half feet higher
than known in 43 years. A Southern
Railway train suposed to have left
North Wilkesboro Sunday afternoon
has not been heard from, while one
that started from Winston-Salem to
that town had to -stop at Elkin. Resi
dents of Jonesville and adjacent
towns were moving to high land.
The Frenchglroad River broke from~
Its course near Asheville, flooding fac
tories and homes In the lower part
1of the city. At Biltmore three per
ons, Capt. J. C. Lipe, Miss Nellie Lipe
and Mrs. Leo Mulholland were drown
ed when the Lipe house was flooded.
Two persons were drowned at Ashe
ville while trying to put food into the
upper story of the Glenn Rock Hotel.
Many are marooned in their residences
along the river and rescue parties for
hours have fought their way against
the rushing current In an effort to
reach them.
Swift streams of water are flowing
down some of the streets of lower
Asheville. The Southern Railway sta
tion is flooded to a depth of six feet
as are all other buildings in that vicin
ity. The city proper, 300 feet higher,
Is without lights, but otherwris, is not
affected.
Industrial p'-:.nts everywhere suf
fered severely, property loss in cot
ton mills, woodworking plants and
lumber yards along the French
B pad gand Swannanoa Rivers was
estimated at from $1,500,000 to $2,
000.000.
Fi'm Hendersonville came a repori
that placed the property loss in Hien
derson county at approximately $1,
000.000. The plant of the Henderson
ville Light & Power Co. was put out
of commission and the city reservoir
flooded by muddy torrents that made
th~e city drinking water unfit for con
sapmtion. Many persons were driver
'from thei rhomes in that seation and
a number of bridges carried away.
Only the big railway bridge south of
Hendersonville remains intact. It was
said, and no trains have entered or

100,00 UARDSMEN
ON[J kA~BORDER
NO MORE TROOPS WILL BE
SENT UNTIL THOROUGHLY
EQUIPPED.
50,000 REGULARS ON BORDER
Statement That War Department Is
Contemplating the Draft System to
Recruit National Guard is Non
sense.
Washington. - Department com
manders of National Guardsmen now
mobilizing for service on the Mexican
border, were instructed by the War
Department to defer transportation to
the frontier until the militiamen
have been thoroughly equipped and
organized. This order revokes a rul
ing issued by the department when
the Mexican situation was acute,
which waived certain requirements.
About 25,000 men are affected.
The latest information of the De
partment is that about 100,000 Na
tional Guardsmen now are at the
border. With the 50,000 regulars
there are 5,000 additional men called
from the reserves, officials estimate
that the American strength on bor
der service within a few weeks will
be adeqaute to cope with any present
emergency and will make unnecessary
the dispatch of any more guardsmen
until they are completely equipped
and organized.
Published stories that use of a
general draft was being considered
to fill the National Guard ranks were
denied by the Department. The fol
lowing statement was issued by the
Official Press Bureau.
"The statement that the War Do
I partment is contemplating tne drafft
system to recruit the National Guard
is nonsense. Statements to that ef
fect are purely speculative and have
no basis in fact."
Reports that National Guard units
are being supplied poor and insuf
ficient food are not borne out in
preliminary telegraphic reports re
ceived from all the Department com
manders.
A message from General Funston
reported that General Trevino had
sent many troops south with the in
tention of occupying the Guerrero
San Barja-Santa Rosalia line against
any possible northward advance of
bandits. The dispatch added that
newspapers in Chihuahua -were urg
ing the necessity of an active cam
paign against bandits "to prevent
their reaching United States forces
and border."
HURRICANE DOES SMALL
DAMAGE ALONG COAST
Force of Storm Passes and Normal
Conditions Are Being Rapidly
Restored
Charleston, S. C.-C~omparativer
little damage was done here and
along the coast by the hurricane
which swept the Carolina and Georgia
coast. Reports from Sullivan's Island
a summer resort across the bay from
here, said damage was slight, while
from the Isle of Palms. another near
by resort, came similar messages. Hun
dreds of persons were warned in time
to leave the exposed points.
The force of the storm had passed
here and normal conditions were be
ing restored. A number of windows
were blown in here, hundreds of
trees blown down and trolley, tele
phone and telegraph service was stop
ped by the high winds. At one time
the hurricane raged at 64 miles an
hour. The barometer which fell to
29.02 was rising steadily.
MEXICAN PARLEY GETTING
AT DEFINITE STATUS
Washington.-The informal negoti
a~tions for settlement of the issues be
tween the United States and General
Carranza are understood -to have ad
vanced a long step when Acting Sec
retary of State Polk and Eliseo Ar
redondo, Mexican ambassador desig
nate, held their third conference since
General Carranza's proposal for a
diplomatic adjustment was received
and accepted.
Although botfh Mr. Polk and the
ambassador declined to say what mat
ters were under discussion, there were
indications that the conversations
had passed into the deflate stage,
where specific questions were being
formulated for probable submission to
a joint international commuission.
The commission plan of settling dif
ferences between the two countries is
pr-ided for in the treaty of 184S. U7n
official advice-s from Mexico indicated
that General Carranza favored resort
to it in the present case, and Mr. Polk
is believed to have acceded to the sug
gest ion.
President Wilson discussed the ques
tion with advisors today and the fact
that no interruption of the Palk
Arredondo conferene resulted was ta
ken to indicate that 'the president was
satisfied with the trend of the nego
tiations.
General Carranza's note prop~osing
a diplomatic settlement narrowed the
issues to two specific points, the anx
iety of the United States for protection
for its frontier and feeling of the de
facto government .that the presence of
the United States troops in Mexico
meacd friendly relations.

NEWS FROM CAMP MOORE
Interesting Happenings About Pal
metto Soldiers Who Are in Camp at
Styx, The Mobilization Point for
the South Carolina National Guard.
Camp Moore, Styx.-With the First
regiment "all dressed up and nowhere
to go" and the Second pulling its
shirt over its head as the finishing
touch of its dressing up process for
service the big body of troops here
has become an enthusiastic and effi
cient assemblage of excellently train
ed militiamen who only need actual
experience to make them regular sol
diers.
The day was another of watchful
waiting and no developments of im
portance. The regiment continued to
be ready to move in a few hours after
the receipt of order and soon the Sec
ond will also be a living example of
preparedness. In the First regiment
practically -nothing remains to be
done. The wagons are loaded and
waiting to be placed on the trains, the
sections have been mapped out and as
signments made and even the amount
of food to be provided for each man
has been duly proportioned.
Coast Artillery Vote.
W. W. Moore, adjutant general, has
received the following letter from
John Gary Evans, chairman of the
state democratic executive commit
tee:
"I have your letter in which you
state that it is impossible to change
the date of the encampment of the
coast artillery guard ordered into
camp from August 20 to September 3.
"I hardly think that this is a mob
ilization such as our statute refers to
and therefore the executive commit
tee would be powerless to assist in
providing a way for these young men
to vote. That was the view taken by
the committee. I have written the
Hon. Sam J. Nicholls. confgrepsman
from this district, to take the /matter
up with the war department at Wash
ington and see if something can not
be done."
The encampment of the coast ar
tillery units will be held at Fort Moul
trie, Charleston.
Captain Declines Majority.
Capt. Herbert T. Hames of Jones
ville, senior captain in the medical
corps, N. G. S. C., assigned to the
sanitary detachment of the First in
fantry, was tendered by Gov. Man
ning the vacancy in the grade of
major created by tre transfer of Maj.
A. M. Brailsford to the command of
Field Hospital No. 1. Capt. Hames
declined the promotion, though it
meant a salary Increase of $600 the
year and of course a considerable ac
oession of rank- "I have been with
the First for about ten years," he
said, "and if I accepted the majority
I would be assigned to the Second.
I cannot leave a regiment to which I
am so affectionately attached. I feel,
too, that having enjoyed with it thC
pleasures of military life, I ought not
to leave it now that there is a pros
pect of serious service." .The First
would share Capt. Hames' regret over
any circumstance which should part
him from the regiment.

When Blair Tuttle's sister Maud
came home from finishing school she
unquestionably had been thoroughly
"finished."
Maud had always been content to
wear hats that came from Mrs. Crm
dle's, but since she had brought home
two hats from Madam Rose's in New
York she hadn't any use for Crindle
style.
"Isn't that the most impossible hat
you ever saw," she said one day when
she was passing Mrs. Crindle's with
that big, good-hearted brother of hers,
who was now in the graduating clas
at Truxdale, captain of the football
team and one of the most popular nien.
't looks just like a raspberry sun
dae and it is quite as insipid and ab
surd."
Blair was more attentive to Maud's
little tirade than she had expected.
"You ought to know, I suppose,"
agreed Blair. "Now, I'll tell you why
I am interested. You know our senior
play. Of course, no one is supposed
to know what it is about, but I have
got to gct your help. For some rea
son, I an in charge of the costumes.
I have got to see that the fellows get
the right: sort of thing to wear for
their par is. Now, one . the charac
ters is a young gawk of a country
girl, and her part calls for just the
kind of thing that you seem to think
that ras-berry-sundae hat stands for.
I was thinking maybe I'd get you to
trim up something for me; but I guess
you couldn't do any better than that
hat."
"Oh, Blair, it would be the hit of the
show."
Maud agreed to buy the hat for her
brother.
Caste lines were but loosely drawn
in Truxdale. The minister's daughter
had felt no hesitancy in marrying the
son of the grocer on the corner, the
young doctor felt it an honor to know
the daughter of old Dobbs, who drove
the station wagon.
So C.arice Miggins came In for her
share ot the college fun-little bright
eyed, sander Carice, who had been
known to every sweet-toothed boy in
college as the dispenser of his favorite
brand of soda water or sundae.
But Clarice had cherished ambition.
There was not enough scope for her
imagination in the task of soda dispen
ser. So when an apprentice was need
ed at Crindle's millinery shop she left
the fountain on a day's notice. Blair
Tuttle could but feel a satisfaction in
knowing that hereafter those bright
eyes of hers would shine only for
haughty Mrs. Crindle and her other as
sistants or the occasional woman shop
pers who came in to try on the new
millinery.
"I am so perfectly happy tonight,"
Clarice told Blair when he called at
her boarding house to take her to the
movies, that single source of evening
diversion in Truxdale. "The most won
derful thing has happened. My hat
my very own hat-that I worked on
so hard has been sold. I didn't see
the young lady that bought it, but the
girl who waited oh her said she looked
like a fashion plate, with a hat that
must have come from New York. Isn't
that -wonderful ?"
Blair had more than once before
tried to get his courage up to tell the
high-spirited little girl that slre wasn
part of his own plans for happiness
and that in the career he was about to
start after his graduation from col
lege he needed her encouragement
more than anything.
- "But, Clarice, I don't want you to be
independent. I don't want you to go
on this way."
Clarice was too full of the enthu
sasm of achievement to be stilled.
"I do wish you had seen it before
it was sold, that hat of mine. The
silk was just the color of the rasp
berry sirup we used at the fountain."
Suddenly Blair realized that this
masterpiece of Clarice's was none
other than the property hat he had at
present stowed away in his own room.
What Maud had said to him about it
came back with vividness. What if
Clarice knew? What if she ever found
out that this hat on which she -had
spent so much thought and care, and
on which she had banked such hopes
of future success, was bought only
because it was a caricature? Blain
tried to think of a scheme whereby
her feelings might be saved.
"Do you know, Clarice, my own sis
ter, the one who has been away to
boarding school, bought that hat. She
noticed it the first thing. I must get
you two girls to meet each other
some time. I know you will be great
friends. I believe-Maud is going away
visiting this summer sometimes, and
she wanted that raspberry hat to go
with one of her new dresses. You
ought to have heard what she said
about it! I guess ii: is mcst too pretty
to wear around here in Truxdale. But
Claric, you dont want to go on with
that mihinery business idea of yours.
You know what I am driving at. Two
or three of the seniors are going to be
married right after college closes.
ommclemlent is next week, and
then the senior play will come the
nort night. I have got to stay around
f'r that-I'm the costumer and there
is quite a bit to do-but, tell me,
Clarice, will you marry me the very
next day-. And then when X start out
on that new job of mine I won't have
to go alone."
11er acceptance of his proposition
heped i31air very materially out of the
rasbrryv sundae hat difmeulty.

WHERE WAS HOG-BITE?
MATTER SEEMED TO CALL FOR
SOME EXPLANATION.
Bitter Complaint That "M'oonshine"
Had Been Tampered Wfth Reflect
ed Sormewhat on Public-Spirit
ed Watcher on Duty.
Moonshine whisky was being made
by someone somewhere in the neigh
borhood of Twin Fork creek Of the
Cumberland mountains in Kentucky,
but there was no more definite knowl
edge than that-someone somewhere
in the neighb orhood of Twin .Fork.
It was exceedingly good whisky, too.
None of your amber-colored "'store"
liquor which has beefi aged in charred
barrels until it has changed o'olor. It
was what the mountalileer calls
"man's whisky;" m..:. a color, as
clear as spring wate:. And, accord.
ing to mountain stan.ds, it was old.
The man who discovered the rst jug
of it tasted it, and that night, telllpg
of it in-the Twin Fork store, he an
nounced: "An' she's old, boys; she's
downright plum. ol; I reckon that
liquor was made at least a month
ago."
The first jug had been found is a
hollow tree. Then the jug was empty
and beneath it was a bright silver ddl
lar. The findpr did not disturb either
jug or money. Returning the next
morning, he found the jug, but there
was no money beneath it, and the jug
itself, instead of being empty, was
half filled with liquor. Half an hour
later, on investigation, the jag had
disappeared.
Twin Fork is in a "dry" coumty,
and there was a good deal of excite
ment. The hollow tree was watched
day and night by a man stationed i1
the crotch of a big elm, but nothing
happened. Then a half-gallon bottle
was found in a cluster of bushes two
miles farther down Twin Forks. Be
neath it was half a dollar in small
change, pennies, nickels and dimes.
It was when a third jug was discov
ered in some bushes half-way up a
mountainside that "Hog-bite" Taylor
came out and announced his willing
ness to aid in apprehending the moei
shiner. Previously "Hog-bite" had
been declaring himself in favor of a
little moonshining. The home-made
liquor, he declared, was better and
purer than the stuff bought from mail
order houses, and half again as ckeap.
Why should a man be compelled to
order by mail and then wait sevei'al
days for an inferior article?
"Hog-bite's" proposal was simple.
He would, without pay, go dut and
watch the newly discovered hiding
place and see if he could not catch
the moonshiner in the act of fling the
jug So that he would not have to
neglect his post for supper, "Hog-bite"
took along a 'package of chicken salid
wiches and a jug of clear, cold water.
He would not have to leave the vi
cinity of the jug for even a drink. He
was to report next morning. Morn
ing came and no "Hog-bite." Nine
o'clock-ten o'clock-eleven o'clock.
Somebody went out t.o investigate.
He found neither jug nor "Blog-bit."
Stuck on a twig of a tree, however,
was a note, printed with lead penci.
It read:
"I don't object to nobody bein' l'eft
to watch my jug of liquor. But Isob
ject like - to the map, what left to
watch it drinking half of k and fihnei
It up witli water."
Perls of the Air.
Accordlrig to early report, two of
the acroplanes performing advance
scout duty for our troops in Mexico
have disappeared. This'did not Imply
that they met destruction, for they
were later discovered with their dvla
tors uninjured.
It is true, hewever, that the dangers
attendant upon this new form of mlie
tary service have not been overesti
mated. In the British house of com
mans the statement was made. last
week that the record of casualties InL
the aerial fighting force, so far as
tabulated, showed the loss of 405
killed, wounded and -missing.
IMost of the fatalities occurred in
active combat, and this 'is attributed
to the superiority of the German ma
chines in capacity and equipment. But
of the total more than 100 had simply
disappeared, flown out of sight and
never returned-"missinlg." The perils
of the air are less furiously destruc
tive than those of the battleflefd, but
they have the thrill and the cgll-of
mystery.
Women Used in Garrisons.
Women are now being employed'in
garrisons in France in the place %of
soldiers of the auxiliary service. The
experiment, just begun at the head
quarters of the Thirty-sixth infantry
at Caen, has proved so successful that
the minister of war has suggested
that the commanders of other garri
sor:.s use the services of women wher
ever it is possjible. Thus the drafts
of the 1SSS military class will be lim
ited. which will permit professional
men to continue to attend to their
regular duties and will give employ
ment to the widows, mothers and
sisters of soldiers killed.
All the women used in the gat.ri
sons are to be classified under the di
rection of various chiefs of the service
and will be 'placed according to their
qualifications.
Many Drug Victims.
It Is estimated that there are in th~e
United States 250,000 slaves of mor
phinc. czcaine and other drugs, and
that they consume annually.$6,500,000
worth of drugs.
