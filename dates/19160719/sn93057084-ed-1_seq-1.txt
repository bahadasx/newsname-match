Remember the Evangelistic
meetings in the big tent at Gettys
burg commencing today. Good
speaking and singing. It is bet
ter to seek for health of soul and
body, rather than the pursuit of
pleasure and gaiety. The fruit of
the former is Happiness, with
its Joy and Peace—the Pearl of
Great Price—while the latter
leads to sickness, disease and
death.
Count}* Judge S.M. Howard
was over last Thursday evening in
his ne«v car, accompanied by Mr
Joe Eulberg, a mechanic in Art

invited to accompany them on
their return. Leaving here at
7:40 p. m., we arrived in time to

House, and next day said editor
was at home in time for dinner, at
a little after one cclock, getting a

SHOULD SLOAN'S LINIMENT GO ALONG
Of course it should! For after
a strenuous day when your muscles
have been exercised to the limit an
application of Sloan's Liniment
will take the soreness and stiffness
away and get you in fine shape for
the morrow. You should also use
it for a sudden attack of toothache,
stiff neck, backache, stings, bites
and the many accidents that are
incidental to a vacation. "We
would as soon leave our baggage
as go on a vacation or camp out
without Sloan's Liniment" writes
one vacationist: "We use it for
everything from cramps to tooth
ache." Put a bottle in your bag,
be prepared and have no regrets.
