A" German raid in the region of I'aschendaal,
Belgium, was checked by the
i French lire as was a raid north of the
Aisne. near Paezzy.
One of the most striking episodes
of the great Sonnne offensive was the
taking of the steel fort at Biaches and
the garrison of 113 men by nine
French soldiers. The fort had resisted i
throughout the artillery bombardment
and the infantry attuck had been.

fire. By a lucky chance a FrenchI
nfllcer discovered the precious secret
that the terrible bombardment had
made the fort vulnerable at one point, i
Selecting a second lieutenant, two sergeants,
a corporal and four men he'
led them on hands and knees through j
the long grass to the spot where he
knew there was a breach in the do-1
fenses. They reached their objective j
point without the Germans learning of.
their approach.
Abruptly three of the French ofllc-1
?rs leaped into the works, shouting in;
steptorian tones:
"Forward with the bayonet." I
The other six daring Frenchmen remained
behind ready to retreat if the
attempt failed. But the Germans, taken
unawares, had no time to get their1
weapons and surrendered almost with
nut a show of fight. When one or their j
number fell, shot by a revolver fired!
point blank by the commanding oflle-1
er. the Germans. 113 in all, came out
of their shelters and threw up fbeir
hands.
