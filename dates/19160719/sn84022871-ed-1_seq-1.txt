Methodist Episcopal Church Notes.
Rev. I. A. Eaxxet, Pastor
You are cordially invited to attend
all services.
Morning worship, 10.45.
Sunday school, 12 o'clock.
Epworth League, 7 o'clock.
The subject of the Sunday morning
service was, "The Making of a Man,"
the text being I Timothy 2:5. The
mystery of the incarnation is no great
er than that of many things all around
us which we readily 2ecepr, saying they
are the workings of nature. Nature,
however, is but a manifestation of the
power of God. As a man Jesus knows
our humanity. In no other way would
Jesus have become what he is to us, a
pattern of all that is noble, true and
pure By his incarnation he dignified
our manhood and make3 us see how
great a thing it is to be a man. Many
of the combinations of flesh and blood
cabled men have no real right to that
name. Physical strength alone does
not make a man. Some measure a
man by his intellectual power, others
look at the statesman, diplomat or
business man and say he is the ideal
man. Nothing so truly makes a man
as real service. Every age has had its
great men but each has had its imper
fections. It is a sad reflection upon
our American people that fraud and
deception are so often applauded when
they should be condemned. The call
today is for men with strong convic
tions of right and wrong and strength
to stand for right against ridicule and
opposition. The call is for men who
believe in Christ and are willing to
stand back of his work. Money alone
will not run a church, but money,
npnnle and religion maise a nne com-
bination.
The Epworth League had charge of
Vio pwenmcr service at 7 o ciocK ana a
very interesting meeting was held

Folsom has been broken into. On
Saturday morning when Clayton Wilson
opened the market he discovered that
the money drawer had been tampered
with, and going to the safe found the
money had been taken from that also.
The entrance was made through a
window into the back room and the
money drawer had been opened with
out breaking it and about $15 in silver
had been taken.
The safe had not been locked the
night before and more than $100 had
been taken from that. Four checks,
which were with the money, were all
safe as was a small amount of money
in a pocket book. The work was evi
dently not that of a professional, but
rather someone who knew local condi
tions. Gov. Gates a Senatorial Candidate.
The St. Albans Messenger contains
the following announcement from
Charles W. Gates: "Numerous re
quests have come to me during the
last few months and especially during
the last two weeks, that I become a
candidate for the office of United
States senator. Until; recently I have
not been inclined to treat these re
quests seriously, but having become
satisfied that they represent the honest
wish of a considerable number of
voters in different parts of the state I
have, after careful consideration,
decided to allow my name to appear on
the ballot at the coming primary elec
tion as a Republican candidate for
United States senator. I shall appre
ciate the support of all those who have
confidence in my integrity of purpose,
and who feelfjthat I, if nominated and
elected, would creditably represent
Vermont in the United States senate.
"Charles W. Gates,

Removing Danger Spots on Orleans Road
George Reed is removing the project
ing ledge just north of the Plunkett
place.on the road from Barton to Or
leans. This curve has been a danger
ous one for automobilists, and others,
for years and the removal of the rock,
allowing unobstructed sight, will render
this heretofore dangerous place a safe
one. Mr. Reed does the work for the
town. The Monitor understands the
selectmen after reading the following
from the Brattleboro Reformer,
thought the danger here must be
eliminated. "Another danger spot
is the narrow road with sharp curves
where it is impossible to see the road
ahead on account of shrubs and trees.
Automobiles have considerable trou
ble at times when they meet on such
curves, but the danger to them is by
no means so great as it is to the young
man who is holding his best girl in a
buggy and neglecting his horse." The
ledge opposite the Mitchell place on the
same road has been removed also and
the strip of road near it is to be fixed.
This is the last bit of road to be im
proved between the two villages.

With every copy of the Monitor this

attempted to make the turn up Mill
Hill and crowded up on the Congrega
tional church lawn, where they collided
with a tree and freed themselves from
the wagon and ran to the barn. Aside
from slight damage to the wagon no
harm was done but had there been any
team or person in, the way it might
have been serious.
