London, July i8'—With the excep­
tion of the region of Longueval and
soutfi of the Somme at Biaches, rela
tive calm prevails on the fighting
front in France.
The British and Germans are en­
gaged in a sanguinary conflict in the
region of the Longueval salient, to the
northwest of Combles. With the
clearing of the weather, the Germans
have taken the aggressive here, after
a preliminary bombardment, in which
a new asphxiating gas shell was used
At last accounts, no decision had
been rcictied In the battle.
To the south of the Somme the
French and Germans are still at grips
at Biaches, where the French have
driven out the Germans from some of
the houses they held in the village:

On the eastern front, Vienna as
trerts that fresh Russian attacks in

pushed back Austrian advances, al­
though the Austrian lines have been
firmly held.
In the vicinity of Riga, the Russians
are vigorously on the offensive

have been repulsed with heavy loss­

In the Austro-Ttalian theater, iRome

ON STATUE
'President Make3 (Personal Visit
To Capitol To Impress His
Opinion
SHOULD BE MADE PART
OF LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
Outcome of Important Issue Still
Hangs in the
ashington, July' 18.—President
Wilson made a personal visit to the
capitol today to emphasize his desire
that a child
..labor law be put on the
statute books at the present session.
To senate leaders, whom he sum­
moned, to a series of conferences in
the president's room adjoining the
senate chamber, he said the child lab­
or bill passed by the house should be
made a part of the legislative pro­
gram, to be put thorugh before ad­
journment. Determined opposition
by southern senators forced the house
bill, which would prohibit the ship­
ment of goods manufactured wholly
or in part by the children out of the
imperative program drawn up by the
Democratic caucus last Friday. It
was left in a secondary position to te
considered only if time remained af­
ter other measures regarded as more
urgent had been disposed of.
Mr. Wilson had been told that an
effort to force its passage would see a
serious party revolt.
Whether the presidents's visit ac­
complished anything more than to
bring his own position in the matter
more emphatically to the front was
not known tonight. So far as could
be learned, the Democratic Steering
committee contemplated no change in
the program and no call had been is­
sued for another committee to con­
sider the president's request.
The president's appearance at the
capitol was unannounced. He im­
mediately sent for Senator Kern, ma­
jority leader. Later he discussed the
project with Senators Martine, Wil­
liams, James and Owens of the Demo­
cratic Hearing committee, and Sena­
tors Simmons and Hughes-
Senator Martine, Williams and Sim
mons are among those inclined to
postpone action until next December.
Those who saw the president were
reticent about the conference. Sena­
tor Kern said that the discussion was
nothing to get excited about and so
far as be knew the present visit would
not necessitate any delay in tbe con­
templated adjournment of congress.

Mrs. Paul Willman, of only- metlium
size and not overly robust last (tight
grappled with a six-fopt burglar,' rein­
forced by a man outside,: and drove
him from her house at Mandan and
Broadway.
Her husband, who is in the transfer
business, was away from home last
evening. Two well-dressed- njgn, so
well dressed that Mrs. Willman
thought them traveling salesmen,
walked up to where she was sitting
on the porch and asked her what time
it WQC
She Lights Light.
Mrs. Willman good-naturedly left
to comply with the request. She lit
the light in the dining room, one be­
yond the front room, to find that one
'of the men had followed her.
"Ten-twenty," she said, but the
man ignored her and jerked open the
cover of the desk.
"None of Your Business."
"What are you doing," she half
screamed.
"None of your damn business," he
replied.
She grabbed a chair and struck him
over the back. He flinched, but dove
and caught her by the neck.
Falls to Floor.
She struggled for a few seconds
then fell to the floor exhausted.
Thinking sh,e was unconscious, the
burglar grabbed what money he could
find in the desk and then started to
rifle the one in the other corner. In
one of the drawers of this desk was
some $95, mostly in silver money.
Mrs. William got her breath back,
saw what he was doing and screamed.
He started to run before he got to
the drawer, but to get out he had to
pass where she was lying-
She Gets Money Back.
She jumped up, threw her arms
around him and grabbed for the mon­
ey, succeeding in setting back three
paper bills and tearing several othr
ers.
Mrs. Willman's dress was torn and
spotted with blood, showing the vio­
lence of the struggle. Papers were
strewn all over the dming room floor
and the chairs in bAh the sitting
room and the dining room were upset
and scattered in the fierce grapple.
Probably Got 930.
Just how much money he got Mr.
Willman would not say last night. It
was probably about $30, all secured
from the first desk.
Mrs. Willmnn was nearly hysterical
last night, but she gave a fairly good
description of the men to the police.
"I never thought for a minute that
they could do anything wrong. They
were so good looking, tall, clean­
shaven, heavy-set men. I thought they
were traveling salesmen."

The prison bloodhounds were secur­

they were hot on the couple's trail,

BELIEVED ONE MEXICAN
WAS KILLED IN MELEE
El Paso, Texas, July 18.—A party
of mounted Mexicans exchanged fire
with company of the Ninth Massa­
chusetts infantry near here today.
Acording to reports, the guardsmen
were doing outpost duty, when the
Mexicans rode up on the opposite
bank of the Rio Grande and opened
fire. The guardsmen suffered no cas­
ualties, but reported they believed
they had killed one Mexican.
Captain Hickey of Dorchester,
Mass., commanding the company, esti­
mated the number of Mexicans at
15, but asserted that he was unable
to determine whether or not they
were soldiers. Approximately 50
shots were fired on each side, it was
said.
Both General Cell. Jr., commanding
the El Paso military district, and the
acting commander of the garrison at
Juarez denied they have received offi­
cial reports of the incident, and both
said it seemed trivial.
Travel Turns Southward.
Laredo, Texas, July 18.—The tide

ly abandoned when war appeared im­
minent, according to immigration offi­

turbance of any kind.
The men quietly left their work
this morning and dispersed later,
many attending a meeting in tbe
down town section, lcmpioyers and
employes both declare they are deter­
mined they will not move from the
position they have taken. The men
demand an eight-hour day without re­
duction of pay, and the employers say
they will not grant this, having re­
cently given a reduction of 2 1-2 hours
per week.
Estimates as to the number of men
out on strike varied. According to
Officials of one of the companies af­
fected, there are abut 1,300 men out,
while figures compiled by labor lead­
ers showed the number of men to be
almost 2,300.

Andrew Miller and C. IJ. Young of Bismarck
presentation of the Capita|: pity 's position in the contest to moKf
the seat of government to New Rockford before^ the supreme!
court yesterday. The case had been prepared by a committee .of
Bismarck attorneys and tbe oral arguments were left to theeet
men.
The legal phase of the capital removal light rests squarely
upon two pivotal points:
First: Has the supreme court jurisdiction?
Second: Is the amendment to the state constitution provide
ing for the amending of.the organic law by the initiative anc^

Fixed by Enabling Act.
He pointed out that 'the Enablia£!,,
Act providing for the creatlon of. the*
states of North and South Dakota aad1
Montana fixed tbe capital in only'oa* i'
state, North Dakota. The langiMkCf,
of the act is plain. It says that t^f
capital of North Dakota shall ba ats
Bismarck and that all lands donated •,
shall be for tbe specific purpose de­
signated unless application is mad«
to congress for a modification.
Mr. Miller asserted that unless ap«
plication were made to congress to
apply these lands to tbe erection of
buildings for state capital purposes .at
a point other than Bismarck, a cloud'
would be thrown upon the state's
title to these lands. He declared that
as a preliminary step to a removal of
the seat of government, the legislat­
ure must petition congress to modify
this land grant.
Intent Seems Plain.
Counsel for Bismarck then be
(fa
an exhaustive argument to prove that
the amendment under which Nejt
Rockford is operating is not self-exec­
uting. He compared the phraseology
of the legislative initiative and refer­
endum with that of constitutional ini­
tiative and referendum.
In the case of tbe Bessessen and
Overson concurrent resolution, which
passed, providing for the initiating
and referending of statutes, it is pro­
vided that signers to petitions shall
constitute ten percent of the number
of votes cast for secretary of state at
