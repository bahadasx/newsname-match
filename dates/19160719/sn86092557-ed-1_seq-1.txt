tors Likely to Take Ac
tion Soon.
That tho river traffic problem Is
: fast approaching the point where a
solution may be worked out is shown
by the trend of the discussion among
; the business men today.
Members of the Chamber of Com*
merce stated that tho matter would
be brought up at tho next meeting of
he Directors of that organization and
a committeo or commission of leading |
workers of this association likely will |
be appointed to take up the matter i
with the othor towns along the Monon- j
gahela. Col. Jadwin, of the U. S. En
gineers, who is in charge of the river
transportation problem at Pittsburg. I
In all probability will be invited to
again come to Fairmont to address a
meeting under the auspices of the
Chamber of Commerce aud the Board
I Affairs.
The present tlmo is conceded to be
most opportune for an ugitation of
the river traffic problem and it is
: thought the agitation will prove au
Important factor in inducing the Balti
more and Ohio railroad to make good
! on the promise to build a new freight
station at Fairmont.
A speedy gasoline packet can be
profitably operated between Fairmont
j and Pittsburg for the handling ot
freight according to the opinions of a
-- number of local men who have had
experience in the river packet busi
ness.
f B. J. Wilson, of the Newcomer Ga
rage company, who has had consider
able experience in tho rivor packet
business thinks that a gasoline packet
of. probably two^fi^aujachicli.
?$ould make the trip from Pittsburg in
^<me day would be an exceedingly prof
itable investment, for local capitalists
r'juid that such a proposition could be
^successfully carried out with a moder
ate Investment which would not like
ly exceed $15,000.
7^'^The proposition of asking Col. Jad
win to again visit Fairmont to discuss
the river problem with the local busi
ness men is strongly recommended by
Mr. Wilson.

Good Roads Day
GOVERNOR'S PROCLAMATION NOT
ENTIRELY WITHOUT HON
OR IN MARION COUNTY.
Although today was a splendid day
for work upon the roads none of the
citizens of the county took advantage
of the Governors proclamation to show
their patriotism with the exception of
the "sixty day visitors" at the county ?
jail. These men although convicted
of the hoinous crime of "bootlegging"
nevertheless were working hard today
under the direction of Deputy Sheriff
Tom Bambridge repairing the birm
along the country club road.
The men were disappointed after
working hard all morning and cast-.
ing their eyes vainly up the road hop-!
ing to see the kind suffrage ladles ap
proaching. Reading in the papers that
the suffragettes were planning to feed
the tired toilers of the turnpike, these
men willingly and earnestly approach
ed their task this morning, each rap
idly becoming a strong suffrage advo
cate. This evening they are anti-suf
frage. They dined on the usual coun
ty rations.

put into autos were lying on the side
walks and lemons by the dozen were

(By Ancoclated Press.>
WASHINGTON. July 19.?Post of
fice officials admitted today that Dr.
George W. McNeil, postmaster at
Pittsburgh, had been dismissed from
the service for "failure to co operate
with the department." They said Dr.
McNeil refused to carry out instruc
tions given Iji connection with a re
organization designed to increase the
efficiency of his office.
The first intimation of the action
came in the rollowing paragraph print-,
ed in official bulletin of the depart
ment.
NOTICE TO POSTMASTERS
A postmaster at one of the most
important postoffices in the Unit
ed States has been removed for
failure to co operate with the
partment In carrying out its in
structions regardine the conduct
of tho service in his city.

REALTY iNEHS ASK
TO PAY FOR PAVING
? ? ...??? ?? fp
City is Asked to Lay Con
crete Road on the East
Side.
James A. Meredith, representing
several petitioners of the Hast Side
near the Fair grounds have asked the
city to lay with concrete 3,300 feet of
Morgantown avenue from Holly ave
nue at the residence of Dr. J. A. Gra
ham, to the corporation limits. This
work will cost $2 a linear foot and the
improvement lias been approved by alf
members of the city commission.
The street Is now densely covered
with traffic most of the time, it being
the road from the city to the Fair
Ground. The part of Morgantown av
enue from the Dr. Graham residence
to the corporation limits is one of the
! very poorest within a radious of five
miles from the court house. Besides
being full of deep ruts, it is on a grade
around a dangerous curve. The street
really needs some sort of repair, the
city commissioners think, and it is
more than likely that they will ar-i
range to provide it's one third of the I
cost, which Is necessary before the I
| work can start.
The total cost for the concrete laid
will be $13,200, the price being quot
ed at $2 for a linear foot for a width
of 24 feet.
Property owners along this tract
will be willing, so most of them have
informed ,{he city, to pay two dollars
for their foot frontage.

TAKE 113 GERMANS
Prisoners Were Taken Una
wares While Making a
Heroic Stand.
(By Associated Press.)
PARIS, July 19.?The French made
some progress last night on the Ver
dun front in the course of hand gren
ade fighting in the vicinity of Fleury,
says today's official repof\L Artil
lery action continue energetically in
this sector. ?
A German raid in the region of Pas
chendaal, Belgian, was checked by
French fire as was a raid north of the
Aisne near Paezzy.
One of the most striking episodes
of the great Somme offensive was
the taking of the field force at Ciach
es and the garrison of 113 men by nine
French soldiers. The fort had resisted
throughout the artillery bombard
ment and the infantry attack had been
checked by murderous machine gun
fire. * . ?
By a lucky chance a French officer
discovered the precious secret that the
terrible bombardment had made the
fort vulnerable at one point Select
ing a second lieutenant, two sergeants,
a corporal and four men he led them
on hands and knees through the long
grass to the s.pot where he knew there
was a breech in the defenses.
They reached their objective with
out the Germans learning of their
approach. Abruptly three of the
French officer* leaped Into the works
shouting in stenorian tones, "Forward
| with the bayonet," and throwing bomb
which exploded in the dugout. The
other six daring Frenchmen remained
behind, ready to retreat if attempt fail
ed.
But the Germans taken unawares
had no time to get their weapons and
surrendered almost without a show of
fight. When one of their number fell,
shot by a revolver fired point blank by
the commanding officer, the Germans,
11S In: all, came out of their shelter
and threw UP their hands.
