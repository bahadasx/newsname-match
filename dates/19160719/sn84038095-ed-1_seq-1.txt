CHAUTAUQUA
ANNIVERSARY
Oenlson Is Celebrating the Tenth An'
niversary of Redpalth-Vawter Chau
tauqua System This Week.
BRYAN HERE THURSDAY EVE,
Unusually High Grade of Talent Will
Be Presented to the People for
The Balance of the Week.
Everyone loves an anniversary cele
bration, whether It be the soap bubble
party of the three year old child "or
the more impressive. golden wedding.
This week all Denison is celebrating
the tenth anniversary of the appear
ance of the Redpath-Vawter Chautau
qua system and old and young are on
joying the festivities in beautiful
Washington park, where the Chautau
qua tent ia pitched. To Mr. Keith
Vawter, manager of the Redpath-Vaw
ter Chautauqua system, belongs the
honor 8t having invented the movable
or circuit Chautauqua. To him the
people of the middle west have to ex
tend thanks for the array oj talent
which is made available through such
a system. Prom observations made
while in lecture course work he hit
upon the plan of contracting for talent
for. long seasons, booking them com
pactly in a restricted territory to avoid
long railroad trips, owning the tents
and operating "equipment and careful
ly guarding against useless waste.
The best talent in the country has
been secured by Mr. Vawter for Chau
tauqua work, some of the talent cost
ing him as much as $500 a day. En
tertainment is planned to suit all
ages and tastes, games and stories for
the, little folks in the morning, the
best of mtisic, vocal and instrumental,
and celebrated speakers.
Within the past ten years the Red
path-Vawter Chautauqua bureau has
furnished 1100 lecturers, 20,000 con
certs, to which more than ten million
people have listened and gone home
happier. Chautauqua has done muoli
for Denison. The people of Denison
and [vicinity l)y means of this great
institution have had an opportunity
of gathering together amid surround
ings the most delightful and pleasant,
to enjoy talent which in no other way
could be obtained. Denison has the
disthtction-of being' one of the charter
membbVs of tfie'ttedpath-Vawter Chau
tanqua system as Denison contracted
for a Chautauqua the first year that
the plan Wag carried out and each year
it has grown in favor with the people
of this community until it is looked
forward to with the utmost anticipa
tion. Mr. Vawter lias spared no ex­
pense in the celebration of the tenth
annual Chautauqua and lie is bringing
to Denison this year a record breaking
program, which is conceded to be the
best array of talent, ever presented at
a chautauqua. We will have an oppor
tunity to hear Hon. Win. Jennings
Bryan, who will speak on Thursday
evening. Mr. Bryan has spoken in
Denison before and always attracts a
large audience. Opie Read, Senator
Thos. Gore, Dr. E. A. Brinton, Dr.
C. C. Mitchell, Gov. Malcolm R. Tat
terson, George L. McNutt, Hon. Chas.
F. Scott, George E. Colby, Col. Geo.
W. Bain, Henry Augustus Adrian and
an array of musical talent are the
headliners brought to us this year by
Mr. Vawter.
Denison's tenth annual chautauqua
formally opened on Tuesday afternoon.
The seats and much of the equlpmont
arrived in Denison last Friday, being
shipped here from North wood. Mr.
Fred Smith, the property man, arrived
Friday afternoon and soon was busily
engaged in getting the ground a in
readiness for tbe big tent. Monday
forenoon Mr. Mott R. Sawyer, the
superintendent, with his crew of help
ers, arrived in Denison from Osage,
and before night thestent was pitched.
Tuesday morning seats were put in
place and the big canvass was stretch
ed around the grounds.
Junior chautauqua has been fully or
ganized and scores of litcie folk.? are
enrolled for this pleasant feature of
the chautauqua week. .Miss Bertha E.
Drown is in charge of the children
and already they are loud in their
praises of her work. Every morning
|it 9 o'telock Miss Drown meets with
the little folks, telling them stories
of the jungles of Africa, and a com
prehensive study of animal life is con
ducted. There will be thletic field
stunts for the boys and appropriate do
ings for the girls and on the last night
the junior^ will take part in a regular
program presenting a spectacular cos.
tumed pageant called "World Wide
Peace."
Mr. Mott Sawyer, the superintend
ent this year, is making a hit with
chautauqua goers. His announce
ments are brief and to the point, in
terspersed with fun, which keeps
the audience in good iiumor. The op
ening program took place yesterday
afternoon at 2:30 o'clock with the Kel
logg«Haines Sinking company. The
music was exceptionally good. Fol
lowing the music Chaplain E. H.
Lougher, of Michigan, delivered a lec

in which he discussed the crim'e prob

BALL GAME WAS
FULL OF THRILLS
Denison Wallops Woodbine Sunday to
the Tune of 4 to 1, With "Smoky*'
Rhodes on the Mound.
NEW GRANDSTAND IS ERECTED
Fans Privileged to Witness Classy
Game, Notwithstanding Hea*t of
Day—Wahl's Nose Broken
The Denison ball team defeated
Woodbine Sunday afternoon at the lo
cal diamond in one of the most excit
ing games of the season by a score of
4 to 1. The game was full of thrills
from start to finish and so excited
were the fans that they had little time
to even think of the high temperature.
A new grand stand has been erected
at the ball park, which accommodated
scorcs of fans, who were able to wit
ness the game in comfort. Howard
Wahl, who did tho catching for Deni
son, was injured in the seventh inning
when one of the Woodbine players
smashed into him at the platter, break
ing his nose and cracking his shoulder
blade. Wahl did not let a little thing
like that interfere with his playing
and managed to finish the game.
Smoky Rhodes, the invincible of
Omaha, did the twirling for Denison,
and to say that his work was classy
is putting it mildly. Rhodes had
plenty of steam and Woodbine was not
able to decipher many of his curves.
The battery had the support of the
Denison bunch and tho whole team
played with the precision of a well
oiled machine.
Denison scored its first run in the
second inning when Rhodes pasted the
ball out into the alfalfa field for a hoine
run. The fans went wild over this
exhibition of nifty hitting. The sec
ond time Smoky was at bat he landed
on the sphere for a two bagger over
center field and was scored by Heid
en. Denison's other two scores were
made in the seventh by a neat drive
by Wahl. Woodbine's one lone score
was made in the seventh.
It was a great game from every
standpoint and in fact was equal to a
league game.
Denison's lineup was as follows:
Rhodes, pitcher Wahl. catcher HeijJ
en,'1st base Collins, 3d baser Jacob
son, 3d base Richards, short Rich
ardson, left field Locke, center field,
and Miller, right field.

REPUBLICANS IN
BIG CONVENTION
State Convention of Republicans Was
Called to Order at Des Moines at
11 O'clock This Morning.
DRY PLANK OF PLATFORM
Big Fight on For Attorney General—
Road Issue Handled Gently—
Harding Keeps Ou|t of Sight
DES MOINES. July 18—State Chair
man Charles A. Rawson will call the
republican state convention to order
at 11 o'clock tomorrow morning at the
Coliseum with the situation as regards
the choice of a candidate for attorney
general still "up in the air."
Definite crystallization of the sup
port for any of the leading candidates
was slow tonight, and even the leaders
who have been accustomed to dictate
matters for their own districts con
fessed themselves baffled in any at
tempt lo predict the outcome of the
fight.
II. M. Havner and George Wilson
are the two men for attorney general
between whom the balance of power
seems to waver, and tonight John
Fletcher was sitting back and waiting
for a break to come on the first ballot hv. Hunter, of Newton.
that would throw him into the center
of the light for the nomination. Hav
ner claims enough to nominate on the
first bnllot, but admits the possibility
if miscalculatior
Politicians on the outside of the Hav
ner headquarters are passing along re
ports, said to emulate from the Hard
ing-Salinger headquarters," to the ef
fect that their influence is at work
for Havner, and that an enort is being
made to land him the place in order
to balance the ticket with a dry. If
'Miy campaigning of this nature is lin
ing done it is being passed through
several mouths before arriving at its
destination in order to conceal the
source.
Wilson is not expecting to be double
crossed. His friends stoutly maintain
that there will be no nomination on
the first ballot that Havner can not
gain strength on succeeding ballots,
and that YVilson himself is the candi
date who best fits the rest of the slate.
John Guiher is picked by the dope
star's as having gained materially in
the last twenty-four hours for the rail
way commissionerehip 'nomination,
and as being practically assured well
over the number necessary to win.
'Se
is unconcerned by rumors of a coali
tion of candidates against him.
Judge Scott Lewis, of Glendale, feo
far is the only man mentioned as a
candidate for permanent chairman.
Harding is spending most of his time
in his headquarters, coming out at in
tervals to get a breath of air and
beaming upon the crowds in the lob
by.
"It looks like a regular old time re
publican convention," lie said tonight.
"The enthusiasm those fellows are
showing looks like 100,000 majority
for the republican party in November.
I really do not know what will be done
by the resolutions committee. I am
letting the fellows write their own
platform. I said before that the plat
form must be satisfactory to me or
would get oft."
It is generally conceded by dele
gates to the convention that a "dry
plank will be placed in the platform,
and that the road issue will be very
delicately handled. Harding will as
sume that the liquor question is set
tled in Iowa and advocates the sub
mission of the constitutional amend
ment to Hie vote of the people.
There is an interesting contest for
two places on the stato central com
mittee. The entrance of W. L. Stern,
of Logan, well known in Ninth district
politics, into the race for committee
man from that district has added in
terest to western Iowa affairs. Ralph
Priugle, of Red Oak, is another aspir
ant from that district.
In the Sixtli district there is a three
cornered fight among those who would
follow James Devitt, of Oskaloosa. The
aspirants are C. W. Clark, of Monte
zuma: F. C. Huebner, of Albia, and J.
In the Fifth district the fight hovers
about William Dennis, of Cedar Rap
ids Louis Gardner, of Anamosa, and
O. C. Burrows^ of Belle Plaine.
Lars Bladine, of Cedar Falls, seems
to have a cinch in the Third district

still regarded as certain of the Elev
enth district committeeship, although
unexpected opposition has developed
in several of the other districts.
At a late hour tonight the Havner
headquarters reported tho utmost con
fidence in the outcome of the first bal
lot, and declared that Havner would
have between 650 and 700 votes. This
estimate, they reported, was based up
on a close check of all of the counties
of the state which have appeared with
delegates at the convention headquar
ters and upon reports, previously re
ceived from the others.
Tho Eleventh district situation took
on a now turn when it was learned
that E. S. Randall, of Spencer, had
entered the field as a candidate against
B. I. Salinger, Jr. for the state central
committee. District leaders were san
guine as to the outcome of the con
test, but admitted the possibility of
an overthrow of the ticket plans.
Chase Kemming departed Tuesday
for lies Moines, where ho is spending
a few days this week visiting friends.

PREMIUM LIST
FOR COUNTY FAIR
1916 Premium Lislts of Crawford
County Fair at Arion Are Now
Being Circulated.
GOOD PREMIUMS ARE OFFERED
Fair Will be Held on September 5th,
6th, 7th and 8th, and Many New
Attractions Are Listed.
We are in receipt of a copy of the
1916 premium list for the Crawford
county fair, to be held at Arion Sep
tember, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th. The list
was printed by the Dow City Informer,
and is a very creditable piece of work.
It gives all the desired information as
to premiums, programs, list of officers
and directors, and is well filled with
advertising matter. The 1916 officers
are: President, Wm. Eggers vice
president, C. P. Harvey secretary, O.
M. Criswell, and treasurer, T. A. Rae.
For years J. B. Glassburner has been
the treasurer, but as hfe has removed
from the county the office will be filled
by Mr. Rae. The fair at Arion has
been a success from the start, some
jears more than others, but on the
whole the affair has been a paying ven
ture, and has furnished entertainment
and educational facilities that can-on
ly be gained at such gatherings. Peo
ple of the county are beginning more
and more to look forward to the event
with interest, and are preparing stock
and farm products in greater numbers
and quantities than heretofore. The
fair this year promises to be bettor
than previous ones, and all should
bear the date in mind.
Lowell Moeller, the twelve year old
son of Councilman H. W. Moeller, has
been on the sick list for the past few
days. His sickness had all the symp
toms of the dreaded infantile paralysis
and the attending physician at once
quarantined the patient. He is rapidly
improving and inasmuch as he has not
shown any signs of paralysis, it is be
lieved he is not suffering with the dis
ease. Lowell has been swimming in
the Boyer river and it may be possi
ble that his illnesp is some form of
malaria fever. Denison people were
greatly agitated over the reported ca#e
of infantile paralysis, but this has sub
sided since it has become known thftt
the boy is not afflicted with It.
Messrs. Carl F. Kuehnle, J. P.' Cfon
ner and P. J. Klinker departed yfester
ciay for Des Moines, where they are in
attendance at the republican state con
vention, being delegates from this
county.
