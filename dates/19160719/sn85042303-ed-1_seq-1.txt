PICNIC AT WHITTINGTON PARK
NEXT WEEK FROM PUBLISHED
PROGRAM SEEMS TO BE GATH
ERING OF SOCIALISTS.
It has developed that the great far
mers picnic advertised for Whltting
ton park next week is nothing more
or less than a gathering promoted by
the socialist party of this city and
county, and the advertisement of the
affair as appearing in the last issue
of the socialist organ in this city
contained part of the program which
contained several well known social
ist spellbinders who will address
the people on their pet hallucination.
It was the Intention of the candi
dates for county offices when the af
fair was first promulgated to be pres
ent and contribute toward the festi
vities of the occasion, also they were
willing to bear their part of the ex
pense, but since the affair is gotten
up for the seeming purpose of giving
the kumrids a chance to unload a lot
of hot air, the candidates, to a man,
have declined the kind invitation and
it Is within the bounds of possibility
that the only Farmers? who will be
present on this festive occasion will
be those of the red card persuasion.

have recently completed two one
story bricks on East Main street, and

In
the greatest single day's gain made by the Iiritish Kine their offensive began on July 1, they captured three vil
lages on their way toward Hapaume, the important railroad center which is believed to be the present Iiritish
objective. The map shows the Iiritish line as it wan before July 1, when the advance began, and the gain
made by the strong one day's advance. The Hermans have consistently attempted since the war began to con
ceal the names of the generals who command in various' sectors of the western f rent, but it is known that
General von Einem, whose picture is shown, has a very IhrIi command, perhaps the highest, in opposing the
French and British offensive. He is a veteran of the Franco-Prussian war of 1S70-'71.

COMPANY IS IN CITY AND IT IS
BELIEVED THAT A SETTLE
MENT WILL BE EFFECTED.

J. McQuatter8, of the McQuatters
Plumbing Co., the contractors who
put down the main street paving is
in town in an effort to make some

maintenance bond. The city officials
have had this question up for some
time and it is to be Sloped that they
will make some form of adjustment
that will enable people to pas3 over
the main streets at least.
The question of getting the streets
of the city repaired has been the
bone of contention between the city
and the contractors for several years
there seems to have been some con
troversy over the bond under which
the streets were supposed to be main
tained for a certain period.
J. S. Downard has Deen furnishing
material to the city for some recent
repairs which the city has begun and
some repairs have already been star
ted on the streets. City Attorney
Drown and Mr. Turner will be in con
ference with the city officials today

that a satisfactory settlement will
be made.
