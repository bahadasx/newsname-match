Columbia was washed away today,
leaving only one railway bridge between
Columbia and the North, that
on the Atlantic Coast Line, a few
miles below the Camden bridge. If

SOUTH CAROl
N
Pee Dee and Santee Sti
Catawba Section
Columbia, S. C., July 18, 1916?
The lower half of South Carolina
- today is facing the prospect of the
most disastrous flood in recent years,
according to the weather, bureau officials,
as a result of the rapid rise in
the rivers caused by heavy rains in
the Piedmont and in the mountains
of North Carolina. The crest of the
flood has already passed the Pied1
mont section, leaving destruction in
its wake, and is now sweeping on toward
the sea, gaining in size as the
smaller streams converge in the bigger
rivers.
The damage to the South Carolina
up-country and to western North
Carolina can only be estimated, as
communication is still much handicapped
by destruction of bridges and
prostration of wire service. Tlie loss,
however, is certain to be severe, as
the streams in many sections have
gone far above flood stage.
Damage on Catawba.
The most important damage reported
is from the Catawba section, ]
where three big railroad bridges and
manv smaller structures have gone i
A PLEASANT TEA PARTY I

lovely, was made more lovely with
many vases of cut flowers and in
the dining room Shasta daises were
used with charming effect, the electrolier
being draped with pale green
tulle and garlanded with daisied.
The tabled were laig with cluny lace
and the merry throng around enjoyed
to the fullest the delightful

BUILDS HOMES
FORx WORKMEN
??? ^ JL.
Bridgeport, Conn., July 18.?'The
war boom has run this town's popu- .
lation up to the point of overflowing
There are 2,000 families here with- ;
out roofs. So the Chamber of C6m- .
merce engineered a private corporation,
organized with no idea of profit,
to build a million dollars worth of \
model houses for them? The first
work on the homes started here today.
It is estimated that nearly 50,000
persons have taoved here to stay
in the last twelve'months. Most of'
them were brought to help make munitions,
but a part of the increase
was caused by the establishment of
4UU Dgl lactones 01 an ivuiua 111 uic
last few years, here.
The poorer workmen felt the
pinch of the situation fiist. Landlords
boosted .rents when they saw
what was happening, &> the first
work of the new corporation is the
building of 400-two family houses to
rent at $12 to $18 a month:

THANK YOU!
A few days since as we were returning
from a trip to Georgia night
overtook us before we reached Abbe-,
ville, and we were gratified to see
how well the city is lighted. There,
are electric lights near each other |
all the way up the residence streets J
which ttiake the whole city have the J
appearance of a white way. When we
reached the square it was splendidly 6
lighted, enabling one to see almost as f
well at night as he could in the day !;
time. Greenwood needs more and bet- j11
ter lights. If any of our people do not 8
think so, we suggest that they go. over
to Abbeville some night and take 1
notes.-?-Greenwood Journal.
SONDLEY AND THE S^AKE.

Richard Sondley started on Magazine
street Tuesday afternoon. No, he
didn't dream in his after dinrer nap
he was at z political, meeting shouting
hurrahs for ,< Colie Blease. It
happened in this way: .The colonel
wanted to look industrious before
his son-in-law Dr. Harvin,' who had
just come down from Washington to h
spend a few days with Mrs. Sondley 1
and himself. Mrs. Sondley had ^ld ?
him to set the doctor a good exam- ,
pie while he was there, so after din- ?
ner Tuesday the colonel went ort to h
trim the fig bush. He got away under
the overhanging branches and y
was getting out all the dead timber n
and driftwood when he felt some- j
thing around his left ankle. He
thought it was his little grand-daughter
and that she was playiug a trick ^
on him and he trimmed right on.
After a while it wrapped' around *
again, and ho .looked down and saw
if was An rmlanH mnecAflin which had
by this time made three wraps
around hisi ankle. >
He set the doctor a good example
in high kicking and all the neighbors ^
an example in how to hollow when S
in trouble. In fact he aroused the!
whole town. Col. Patrick Roche- was I
sitting on the front piazza of his!
country residence four miles from S,
town, watching the gathering clouds *
when he recognized his friend's "
voice, and he knew from the tones f
of it that the friend was in trouble, !;
so he hastened into town and rushed
right over to the residence. By this ' p
time Colonel Sopdley by hard kick- .
ing, had gotten the snake loose and "
Mrs. Sondley had gotten the cam- a
phor and was holding it to his nose. "
Colonel Roche advises us that the J8
front yard where colonel Sondley ?
performed his gyrations looked like {?
a French aerial bomb had "lit" there. | .
Will, the butler, killed the snake,"
and hung it up to see if it would y
cause it to rain. *
