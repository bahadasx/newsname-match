ROAD INSPECTION TRIP
County Roard Inspects Road to
Pigeon Rim and Visits
Canadian Road Camp
On Tuesday morning Commissioners
Bally, Jacobson, Allen, Pederson and
Ohairman Engelsen, accompanied by
Engineer Hughes, County Surveyor
Berglund, Oscar Olson, William Olson
and C. 6. Stnbstad made a trip to
Pigeon River for the purpose of inspect­
ing the road which is practically com­
pleted. The road was very good, open­
ing a territory which will, in time, be­
come one of the banner farming com­
munities of the county.
The site for the bridge is a canyon
about fifty feet deep, with good sub­
stantial rock walls ninety feet apart, re­
quiring a 120 foot bridge to secure good
footing.
The party, with the exception of
Commissioners Engelson and Bally,
forded the river and followed the Ca­
nadian survey and the Pigeon River
tote road to the Canadian road camp, a
distance of about four miles. The right
of way was cleared about a half mile
thiB side of the camp, leaving about
four miles of clearing to be done.
Another half mile down the road the
advance grading crew of about twelve
men and four teams was encountered.
Their work seemed to be to clear out a
passage way for another grading orew,
which was a couple of miles farther
down the road, and was using
a large steam grader, capable of doing a
great deal of work if conditions were
favorable. The total number of men
employed at the two camps visited was
about fifty.
The road, as laid out on the Canadian
side, leaves the river and goes through
about four miles of rich agricultural
land, lightly timbered, then striking
the Pigeon again and following the river
for a distance of nearly four miles. From
the road, as laid out along the river, the
yieW is gorgeous. One hundred feet
below is the river, nearly five hundred
feet wide, visible in places for two or
three miles. Across the river, on the
American side, you see great towering
mountains covered with light timber.
A little farther on is a beautiful cascade
and still farther on a mighty water fall.
This part of the road has no doubt been
selected on account of the scenic gran­
deur, as the cost of making a good road
on this location will be tremendous. As
it looks at present their road will not
connect with ours for some time, and it
is possible that they will be unable to
finish until the early part of next year
In that event it is possible that the
present idea of a temporary crossing
will not be necessary, as there is no
reason why the permanent bridge cannot
be constructed by July 1st next year.
One pleasant feature of the visit on
the other side was the visit at the cook
camp, with the chef, David DeRosie,
who treated the party to an elegant
lunch. Most of the party also enjoyed
a swim in a large pool in Pigeon river.
A stop was made at the Bayle camp
at Little Brule, inspecting work being
done there, which is progressing very
rapidly and will be completed in a few
weeks.
The road on the Reservation is pract­
ically completed, four or five men being
employed in putting on the finishing
touches.
A visit was made at the Earl Roberts
farm, Mr. Roberts has cleared about
thirty acres and surely will become one
of our largest farmers at the rate he is
clearing, he having only been on this
farm a few years. Mrs. Roberts treated
the party to lunch, which Commissioners
Bally and Engelsen thought much of
while waiting for the rest of the party to
return from their Canadian visit.
