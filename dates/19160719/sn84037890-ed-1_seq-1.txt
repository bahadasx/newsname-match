Mexico extends through 17 de
grees of latitude, and the climate,
according to locality and altitude, Is
tropical, subtropical or temperate.
If there should ever be war with
Mexico our troops sooner or later
would have to operate, It may be as
sumed, In every part of the country.
Including the two coastal zones
down to the Isthmus of Tehaunte
pec, and even in Chiapas, Campeche
and Yucatan, most of which region
comes under the head of tlerras
callentes or hot lands. Here the
IreaT In what We call our summer
season is Intense, and the rainfall,
except in Yucatan, is heavy. Sultry
conditions prevail in the wet iseason,
and at Vera Cruz, on the Gulf of
Mexico, and at Guaymas and Acap
ulco, on the Pacific Coast, the shade
temperature sometimes rises to 105
degrees. While the climate is rated
debilitating and unhealthy for
Northerners, it will be remembered,
that Funston's brigade In camp at
Vera Cruz never had p. long1 sick
list and came through the ordeal In
excellent condition. Sanitation has
become an exact science in the
hands of American army surgeons, I
even in tropical countries. The best
, season for campaigning in the tier-
'Tas' callentes. say at Vera Cruz and
Tamplco, is, of course, in the period
corresponding to our winter. At
any other time those seaports are
not to be recommended to people of
the North.
Above latitude 2S, which passes
through the States of Coahuila, Chi
huahua, Sonora and the territory of
Lower 'California, the four seasons
are about as well marked as In the
"United States, but It must be consid
ered that altitude is a prominent
factor in climatic conditions all

Bearing this In mind, the country
Jhorth of latitude 28 may be de-
sc
scribed as temperate. High up in
the mountains of Chihuahua and So
nora the heat is seldom excessive,
and the nights, even In summer, are
cool, If not cold. It Is different in
the desert of the three northern
States. There the heat in July and
August, after the first freshness of
the early morning has passed, is al-l
most insupportable; yet a blanket
may be needed at night, for after
sunset the temperature often de
clines rapidly.
South of latitude 28 is the tlerra
templada, or subtropical zone, com
prising parts of Coahuila, Chihua
hua. Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potosi,
half of Tamaulipas, Western Vera
Cruz (the State) and districts in
Oaxaca, Chiapas, Guerrero, Jalisco,
Slnnloa and Sonora. In the high
lands, the altitude of which here
and there rises to nearly 6,000 feet,
the night temperatures are refresh
ing; the days are hot, but not un
bearably so if excesses are nvoided. j
Extending south from Durango to
the City of Mexico, the great table- art that the crop will be much short

at all times of the year, and the ell- per bushel for the wheat that Is
mate Is especially delightful in our
summer montns, although changes
of temperature aro sometimes ab

to be guarded. Even the rains on
the tableland and south of latitude
28 there is a rainy season from May
to October have seldom anything1
of the deluge character. They may
be frequent, but they are generally
light. Elsewhere than on the table

UAL'UHT AND KILLED
New- York, July 13. A monster
shark, whose- stomach contained

Keyport, N. J., to-day, according to
Information received at the weather
bureau here from the observer at
Long Branch, N. J.
The shark weighed 300 pounds
and is eleven feet long. It was kill
ed near the mouth of Matawan
creek. It Is undoubtedly the same
fish which yesterday invaded the
creek and killed two persons, the

U is now stated that the waters
f the Atlantic seaboard are Infested
with sharks.
The British sloop, Sir George;

a score of' sharks the crew had
caught in the gulf stream during
their twelve days' voyage to this
port.
The last was caught off the New
Jersey coast day before yesterday.
The crew said that the big lish were
numerous and hungry. They follow

at bait. They said that sharks in
Bermuda waters were common

VALUE OF CANALS .
IN LANDS OF WAR
Their Usage Dates From
Many Years Ago.
OlDlST Mils" IN FRINGE
America's First Canal Dug in
Massachusetts When Wash'
iugton Was President.
ARK VALL'AIILK IX EVERY AGE
The hlstoriaug will tell the next
generation about the enormous val
ue of canals In this European war.
Over exactly the caravan route
traversed by the Crusaders S0O
years ago the Germans have a canal
from the Rhine to the Danube.
It is therefore possible to send a
submarine from Cologne to the
Black Sea with as much freedom
from a hostile shot as to navigate a
canoe on the Schuylkill river.
That Black Forest Canal is play
ing a vital part in Germany's swift
mobilization of war munitions, Just,
as the Kiel Canal makes her fleet
as safe from an enemy's battleships
as If it were in the great park at
Berlin and miles from a navigable
stream.
The Egyptians had canals before
the days of St. Paul, but the lock
canal which made it possible to
cross mountains in a boat came only
a few years before Columbus discov
ered America.
To be told that Raphael In his
spare moments when not painting a
Raphael was' constructing a locomo
tive would scarcely surprise you
more than to be told that Leonardo
da Vinci was a pioneer canal lock
builder.
But the hand that ",'mr"u'pon (Kej

That canal was finished the year
before William Penn set foot on the

America's first canal was dug at
South Hadley, Mass., when Wash-
ington was President. It was com-
pleted 120 years ago. That little
waterway gave JJe Witt Clinton his
idea of .the canal across New York
State the greatest single Impetus
ever contributed to tho upbuilding
of a largo city.
It was tho Erie Canal that gave
New York the needed speed to pass
Philadelphia as the metropolis of
this continent.
Barring only the Panama Canal,
which severs North and South Ainer-
lca' antl tlle Suez Cana'i which made
an island or Africa, by far the most
picturesque Idea for a canal was
framed by John C. Calhoun.
When that illustrious Democrat
was Secretary of War, almost a cen
tury ago, he advocated a Govern
ment canal to connect Boston with
the Gulf of Mexlcb. This apostle of
State rights, whom President An-
drew Jackson threatened to hang,
was the father of that inland road
for ships which wideawake Congress-
men are advocating to-day.
The Cape Cod Canal and the cut
across New Jersey as wtell as the
Delaware and Chesapeake were in
Calhoun's head, as were canals
across tho Great Dismal Swamp and
Florida to the Gulf.
Washington was also a canal pro-
Jector. He planned a waterway to

time are that the wheat yield Is not
over ten bushels to the acre. The
report follows:
"The last of June found every
body busy on the farm. The late
corn Is scarcely laid by, the early-
corn needs cultivation, threshing has
begun In many localities. The wheat,

"Excessive
rainfall over a large
area of the State during June has
prevented the proper cultivation of
the crops audi in consequence, the
growth of same Is retarded by weeds
and grass. Pastures are In good
condttlon.
"Threshing Is In full sway, and
while only a part of the wheat has
been threshed, It Is estimated that a
very small yield will be tho result.
This yield Is estimated at ten bush- j
els per acre. Oats have done much
better and show a yield of twenty
bushels per acre.
"Corn Is reported as looking well
and with seasonable weather this
crop bids fair to be a good one. Con
dition of same Is given at S7 per
cent.
"Tobacco as a whole Is doing well,
though some complaint Is made of
blight on the plants. The condition
,of hurley is given at 87 per cent.,
wnii dark tobacco, shows at 90 per
csnt.
"Tho condition of livestock is
good. While hog cholera is reported
as being prevalent In some localities
no heavy losses have been sustained
due to the fact that anti-cholera
serum is being more generally used
aid more attention Is being paid to
the feeding of hogs and tho sanitary
conditions surrounding them. The
average condition of llvstock is as
follows: Horses, 94 per cent.; cat-

sheep, 95 per cent.; chickens, 93 per
cent.; turkeys, 83 per cent.; ducks,
