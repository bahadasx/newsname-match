Says Vienna, While Petrograd Claims German Rout in
Volhynia Cannonading on Greek Border.
With the exception of the region of
Longueval nd south of the Somme
at Biaches, relative calm prevails on
the lighting- front in France.
Tile British and Germans are en
gaged in a sanguinary conflict in the
region of Longueval and to the north
west of Comhles. With the clearing
of the weather the Germans have
taken the aggressive hero niter a. pre
liminary bombardment in which now
asphyxiating' shells were us-iJ. At
last accounts no report or 310 progress
had been reported.
To the south of the Somme the Ger
mans and French are still at grips.
The Germans tailed on Tuesday to re
new their attacks between Biaches and
La Maisonette on which the French
infantry concentrated their lire.
On the eastern front Vienna asserts
fresh Russian attacks in the territory
southwest of Lutsk were without suc
cess, but says that in the Carpathian
region near Zabie and Tatarow the
Russians have pushed hack Austrian
advanced posts, although the Aus
trian main line held firmly. In the vi

HEAVY GERMAN GUNS
IN BRITISH HANDS
Second Lino of Defense Far Less For
midable Than First.
London, July 18, 10 p. m. While
the adverse weather is compelling a
lull in the fighting on the western
front, military critics are taking stock
of the situation. They are agreeably
surprised by the large captures of
heavy armament, Gen. Sir Douglas
Haig, the British commander-in-chief,
has been able to announce. Although
the British attacks have been pressed
with great rapidity in order to give
tho Germans no time to organize for
midable defenses, at the same time, as
was evinced by the-withdrawal of the
British from the Foureaux Woods,
where they had reached the German
third line, General Haig wisely resist
ed the temptation to hold on to that
point. That would ha.ve necessitated
eevero fighting- with probably heavy
losses in favor of a. mora, methodical
advance.
Evidence received, from the front, ag
well as the official map- published, here,
seems to proTe thai the German 1 sec
ond line of defense was far lesa strong'
and elaborate than the first; ' hence,
the military observers believed that
the obstacles are lively to be loss diffi
cult as the entente allies advance.
With' regurd to eastern'- front ' Gen
eral von L-insin-f?en's retirement acrcs3
the Lipa is consideredi by the critics
as removing the last serious, obstacle
to the advance , of the Russians to
ward Uemberg. '

British Front in France, July 18 5
p. m. via London 30:15 p. m. On the
map of vari-eolored patches at head
quarters which shows at a glance each
day's r.rogre. of the offensive, there
is one for today's work, to the hour of
writing so far as known, north Ovil
lers and west of Pozierca and anothef
west of Pozicres.
The Britbh apparently are following
the same me' hods after the second big
attack as ai'or the first, fortifying the j
position gained, stalking Gerinan ma
chine gun detachments, taking need-
ful tactical points and feeling their

a prophet who must dio to cany
"alms to the Almighty," became vio

and his wife were killed, but only af
ter more than a hundred had besieged
his residence for more than three
hours and had been forced to resort
to dynamite and fire to end the bat
tle. Mclntyre had a congenial helpmeet
in his wife. He could divine, an i she
believed in him. lie did not. how
ever, believe in work for himself. His
wife adopted this view also and paid
the rent and groceries bill by taking
in washing.
Today when Mclntyre strapped tho
belt of cartridges around himself and
equipped himself with a pistol and a
rifle, his spouse strapped on another
belt and armed herself with a
rifle. Hhe fired the first shot at a
gardener on the side of the fence, and
bellied barricade the house when the
police came, and with her rifle helped
to hold it for three and a half hours.
In the end she died with her husband,
rbe was riddled with bullets and the
lop of her head was blown off. When
Policeman L'dward Hughes entered the
house he found her dead, crumpled up
i nthe wreckage on the floor.
Her husband, fatally wounded, was
gasping and leaning against an iee
box. He turned anil the policeman
sent a bullet into his skull. This shot
terminated the most exciting episode
on the west side in years. ine po

HAVERHILL CITY
OFFICERS INDICTED. I
Charged With Nsrdect to Suppress a
Riot Last April.
T -awrence. Mass., July IS. The en
tire city governrn'-nt of Haverhill is
charged yith "neglect to supm-ess an
un!av.-ful assemb'y" in indictments
returned by the Essex County Grand
Jury today in connection yvith the in
vestigation of the rioting in Haver
hill several months ago when Thomas
Leyden of Sonierville, attempted to
deliver an address on eeetarian schools.
Mayor Albert I, Partlett and Alder
man Rosveeil T,. Wood, Charles M.
Hoyt. who is associate member of the
board 'if health and Alderman Ktiek-p.e--
are named in the indie! men Is.
According to the district attorney's
office, this is the first time that such
a charge has been brought atrainst a
municipal officer in this state. The
statute under which the indictments
are found provides for a fine of not
more than SHOO as a penalty when any
mayor, alderman, selectman, justice of
the peace, sheriff or deputy sheriff,
have knowledge of "riotous or tumul
tuous aud unlawful assembly" in the
city or toyvn whre he lives and ne
glects to exercise his authority for its
suppression.
The rioting is alleged to have taken
place on the night of April 3 when sex
oral persons were attacked and beaten
by a mob and considerable property
damage was caused by stone throw
ing. The announcement that a meeting
would be held in city hall that niuht
at which Thomas Leyden of Somer

speaker, would discuss the subject of
state appropriations for secrerian
schools led to the disturbance.

By a vote of 4R to IS, the senate re

that the Pacific coast always had been
slighted in naval ships, and the latter
emphasized dnmrcrs of Japanese inva
sion. Opponents of the amendment

The shooting took place in a iso

ed from time to time on the Mexican
bank of the river which is about 300
yards wide at this point. Then, he
ai, a mounted detachment appeared
wearing red serapes.
The Mexicans rode lip to the river
bank and dismounted and deployed,
cree ping through the underbrush which
dotted the. river's edge. One of the
Mexicans fired his riile, the bullet
crossing the river and according to
Private Charier: Prescott of Natick,
Mass., dropping at his fee. Screen
ing themselves as much as possible by
little clumps of Mesquit the Ameri
cans returned the fire and by the time
the river was reached had driven the
Mexicans to their honses. Before
reaching the picket line, hoyvever, the,
militiamen assart, one of the Mexicans
stumbled and fell into a clump of
grease wood and did not arise.
The exchange of fire continued less
than ten minutes and when a,bout
fifty shots had been fired on each side
according to the company officers the
Mexicans returned south, disappearing
behind a hillock.
