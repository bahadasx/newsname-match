Military Education.
Is Pre
Enforce SYSTEM TO BE DEMOCRATIC
Senators Believe That Public
Sentiment Demands Law
for a Military System.
(Headed by Senator Chamberlain,
a subcommittee of the Senate Mili
tary Committee is at work on the
bill for universal training.
Strong indorsement of universal
training in many quarters, includ
ing business circles, of late, has
forced this issue to the front. The
legislation cannot be enacted this
session, but progress will be made
toward it.
The effort is being made, with
the assistance of expert army offi
cers, to frame a bill which will have
distinct military, educational, and
other advantages. It is the belief
of those who favor universal train
ing that many benefits would ema
nate from it.
ALL ON EVEN BASIS.
It U proponed, of course, to put
every young m.tn on an even bails In
respect to training, whether he be the
on of a Vanderbllt or the eon of a
day laborer, whether' his father clips
coupons and his mother plays bridge,
or whether his father drives a dray
and his mother takes In washing.
fix other words. It Is proposed to have
the system absolutely democratic, with
out loopholes of escape for those hav
ing political lntlonce. The only test Is
to be whether a young man Is physi
cally qualified for service.
In this connection, one of the pro
posals la that It a man who Is physi
cally qualified does not take training he
Is to be barred from holding public
office.
Would Eliminate Sectionalism.
That It would be posslle to do much
to eliminate sectionalism through uni
versal training; Is the Idea of some ex
perts who have given the subject study.
It is suggested In this connection that
at least part of tho youth from the
North be sent South in winter and take
their training there. That would be
at a time of year when the Northern
Doys could ao nine worts, ai icui,
those living on the farms, and when
the Southern climate would be lnvlt-
fitmltarly. It Is proposed that South
ern boys be sent North for training in
the summer months, when it Is too hot
in the South for comfort. The Inter
change would be of educational and so
cial value ao far as tho residents of
to different sections are concerned.
Would Insure Peace.
Advocates of universal training hold
that It such a system Is put Into force
In this country it will practically Insure
permanent peace, since no nation In the
world would attack if every able-bodied
man were trained to bear arms.
Another proposition advanced Is that
universal training would bo the means
of training a great numher of competent
officers and would make them much
more efficient than now In handling
large bodies of troops.
Calling out of the national guard has
demonstrated that the War Department
Is not organized to cope In practice with
the problem of feeding, clothing and
supplying u lareg army. The system I
weak, and this Is believed by many
to be the cause of many complaints rife
today concerning feeding and clothing
of national guard forces.
With large bodies of men to handle,
army officers would get accustomed to
feeding, clothing nnd maneuvering di
visions and corps and armies where now
they deal with companies and regiments.
REPLACING STRIKERS

sense In keeping Income tax returns

returns."
Upholds Ousting of New York
Militia Officers Despite
Political Pressure.
Secretary of War Baker today sus
tained the action of Mai. Gen. Leonard
Wood, commanding the Department of
tho East, In rejecting Col. Louis D. Con
ley and Lieut. Col. John J. Fhelan
of the Sixty-ninth New York Regiment
for physical unfitness.
Tho War Department found that the
two officers were Incapable of perform
ing all duties of their office In the Held
and were not In condition to warrant
their acceptance Into the service.
Secretary linker In advising the two
officers of thelr rejection assured them
they might make request for any fur
ther re-examlnatlon which they desire
to have made under tho circumstances.
"It should be noted," Mr. Baker said
In an explanatory statement," that the
action taken by the medical and depart
mental officers In these cases Is Identi
cal with that taken in many thousand
cases affecting both enlisted men and
officers of tho National Guard and regu
lar army throughout the United States.
No question Is raised as to their seal,
military capacity, or character as of
ficers, the only consideration being their
own welfare and their ability to perform
active -military duties."
Senator O'Gorman of New York and
about a dozen New York Congressmen
laid pressure on President Wilson and
Secretary Baker to overrule the decis
ion of General Wood.

An additional case of Infantile pa

The latest case, according to the

Health Department officials decided
today to permit the names of infantile
paralysis patients to be made public,
The Health Department announced to
day that unless the situation becomes
more acute tne nouses in wmen mo

The following suggestions for the

Norrls:
"Parents should see that their
children do not place In their mouths
any substance which has been In con

The transference of a toy horn,
whistle or similar article Is to be
avoided, and any vessel which has
been or may have been In contact
with the lips of another person Is to
be looked upon an a source of danger,
unless such vessel, container, or toy
Is known to have been sterilised alnce

The only safe and practicable
method of sterilising such articles is
by means of boiling. The mere re

by means of cold or luke-warm water
or alkalies such as soap can not be
relied upon. .
