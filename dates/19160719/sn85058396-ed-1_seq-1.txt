Nine Frenchmen by Striking
Ruse Capture Garrison of
113 Men.
Paris. July 19. 5:15 zu m One of
the most striking episodes .'of the
great Somme battlo, was taking the
field of Blaches and the garrison of
113 men by nine Frenchmen. The
fort had resisted throughout the ar
tillery bombardment and the infan
try attacks had been checked by mur
derous machine gun fire. By a lucky
chance, a French officer discovered
the precious secret that tho terrible
bombardment had made the fort vul
nerable at ono point Selecting -a
second lieutenant, two sergeants, a
corporal and four men ho led them
on hands and knees through the long
grass to tho spot whero he knew was
a breach In the defenses. They reach
ed their objective point without the
Germans learning of their approach.
Abruptly threo of the French offi
cers leaped into tho work shouting
"Forward with tho bayonet!" and
throwing bombs which exploded In
tho dugout. The other six daring
Frenchmen remained behind ready to
retreat if the attempt failed.
Germans Taken Unawares.
But the Germans, taken unawares,
had no time to get their weapons and
surrendered almost without a show
of fight. When one of- their num-
ber fell, shot by a revolver point
blank, by the commanding officers,
the Germans, 113 in all, camo out of
their shelters and threw up their
hands, the French assert
The three French captors now be
gan to feel nervous as they saw no
reason why the Germans should not
fall upon and exterminate them, but.
at this moment the other six hurried
In. Their resolute energy imposed
upon the Germans, who believed that
the new arrivals were followed by
many others. The German officers
In the fort then threw down their
arms and the entire garrison was
marched to the rear, escorted by the
nine captors, who had not lost a
man.

RESOLUTION FOR EXPOSITION
PASSES UNITED STATES SENATE
Outlook Most Favorable That the Federal Government WiU (
Help Ogden Make the Railroad Celebration in 1919 an
Event of Extraordinary Importance Message Re
ceived From Senator Sutherland.
The participation of the United
States government in the exposition
to be held in Ogden in 1919 to com
memorate the fiftieth anniversary of
the driving of the golden spike ar.
Promontory, marking the connecting
link between the Union Pacific and
Central Pacific, now Southern Pacific,
railroads forming the first transcon
tinental railway, was virtually assured
today by the passing of a joint reso
lution by the United States Senate
this morning.
The resolution was introduced in
congress Monday by Senator George
Sutherland and the announcement of
its passing the senate was received
at the Ogden Publicity Bureau, in the
Weber club, late this afternoon, In a
telegram from its author. The tele
gram follows:
"Washington, D. C, July 19. 1910.
'James P. Casey, Weber Club, Og
, den. Joint resolution for Congres
sional participation in celebration
passed Senate today. (Signed)
"GEORGE SUTHERLAND."
It is anticipated that the resolution
'will reach the House of Representa
tives within the week and there seems
every prospect that It will be acted
upon -favorably by that body.
History of Railroads.
Following is tt brief history of
completing the Union Pacific and
Central Pacific on which the celebra
tion is based:
In July, 1862, the Central Pacific
Railroad company was chartered,
with the intention of building a line
from the Missouri river to the Pa
cific. The spirit of rivalry did its
share in stimulating the activity fo
the Union Pacific company, but lit
tle was done on their part until after
the war. The Central Pacific, how
ever, immediately commenced work.
Work on the Union Pacific did not
begin until IS months after the Cen
tral had inaugurated their section of
the enterprise.
By the opening of the summer of
186S the two companies were nearly
equally distant from Monument
Point, "at the head of Salt Lake. The
competition increased as they neared
each other, and at last the struggle
arose as to the polut of junction. The
Central company wished Ogden fixed
as the point of junction, and the Un
ion urged Monument Point The mat
ter was at last settled by a decision
in favor of the former.
The Indians were so hostile to the
project that several battalions of
United States troops were scattered
along the line. That the completion
of such a vast enterprise should be
hailed as one of the most memor
able achievements In the material
progress of the country, was certain
ly to be expected. Now Is it to be
wondered at that the original pick and
shovel employed in commencing such
a work should have been preserved
and still bo looked upon by every pa
triot with historic interest.
In less than one-half or one-third of
the time predicted at the outset of
the enterprise, the road was com
pleted. The total mileage of the road
built under the direct authority and
by tne am oi tne national government
was 2400 miles. The government sub
sidy in aid of these works amounted
to about $64,000,00, of 6 per cent,
currency bonds, the companies being
also authorized to issue an equal
amount of bonds.
Ninety million dollars was the cost
of the Union Pacific railroad, up to
1869, when it was completed; that
of the Central Pacific, $75,000,000.
On May 10 of that year the great
historical opening of the road occur
red at Promontory Point, Utah. Emi
nent men from tall over the west at
tended. Tho chief feature of the oc
casion was the approach of two en
gines, one from the east and one from
the west each decorated with flags
and evergreens for the occasion,
which saluted one another with ex
ultant screamsv Then a telegraph
wire was attached to the last rail,
so that each blow otthe sledge should
be recorded on every connecting tele
graph Instrument between San
Francisco and Portland, Me.
Finally, It was announced that the
last blow was to be struck. Every
head was uncovered with reverential
silence, while Rev. Dr. Todd of Pitt-
field,. Mass., offered up a brief ana
deeply impressive invocation.1 The
magnificent tie of laurel, on which
was a commemorative tablet of sil
ver, was brought forward, put in
place and Dr. Harkness, in behalf
of the state of California, presented
Governor "Stanford the gold spike. In
behalf of the Central Pacific railroad
he responded with a brief sentiment
and General Dodge, in behalf , of the
Union Pacific, did likewise. Governor
Stanford, assisted by Vice President
Durant, drovo the final spike. Cheer
after cheer for tho union of the Atlan
tic and Pacific by rail was enthusi
astically given.
A telegram was immediately dis
patched to President Grant as fol
lows: "The last rail is laid! The last I
spike driven! The Pacific railroad is j
completed." The completion of the 1
great project was celebrated in many
of the large cities of the country.
Both in San Francisco and New York
the last day was ushered In by tho
firing of a salute of 100 guns. In
Philadelphia the bell on Independence ''
hall was rung. Thus, In the consum- ;
mation of this mighty work, a jour- !
ney around the world became a tous )
both easy and0brief.
