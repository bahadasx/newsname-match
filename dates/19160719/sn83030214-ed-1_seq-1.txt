$ 1,000,000 Raised in Antipodes
Buys Artiflcial Limbs Here
Crippled Soldiers from Australia and Nrw Zealand Find
Benefactor in Englishman Who Purchased His
Wooden Leg in New York.
Manufacturers in this city received a
milllon-dollar order yesterday for arti
licial limbs, to be used by soldiers of
Australia and N'ew Zealand cnppled nt
the Dardanellea and on the French
front. The money was raised for this
purpose by popular subscription in thc
British colonies of the Antipodc*.
Beariag the onlcr came J. W. Mr
Cregor, of Adelaide, chairman of the
South Australia Soldiers' Fund. The
reason why he came to the I'nited
States on his errand, it was learned,
$-oes back to the life story of a wealthy
KngHshman who made his fortune in
Australia.
One Leg Brought Big Order.
C. Billyard Leake, of London, the
story runs, went to the Antipodes when
he was a young man. There he added
to the millions that were already his.
ln 1912, while in New Zealand, he met
with an aecident which necessitated
the amputation of his right leg. He
purchased an artiftcial limb in N'ew
York.
After the war began Mr. Leake re?
turned to London. He transformed his
estate. Haretield Fark, in Middlesex
County, into a large open air BOapltal
for the relief of Australian and N'ew
Zealand soldiers who had lost limbs in
service for Fngland. He employs a
large number of mechanics, imports
mnterial from New York, and manu
factures artificial arms and legs at his
estate. He furnishes the limbs to his
soldier -ruests at his own expense.
When he found that it wouid be 1m
posfble for him to supply the demand
Mr. Leake suggested the ra-.sing of a

Mr. McGregor arrived Sunday on the

care of most of the order.

Hifl the average cost of an artificial '

Cor.tracts with foreign governments

of the red t.ipe which insisted on a

SHOOTS DOCTOR
AS FIANCEE DIES
Physician Tries to Kill
Man He Says Young
Woman Denounced.
[Bv T?>gr?ph '? Th? Trlhin- ]
Boston, July 18.?Two hours after
his fiancee, Dr. Celia P. Adams, of Brook. ,
line, died from an overdose of mor
phine, taken, it is said, with suicidal in- ,
tent, Dr. Eldridge D. Atwood, of Wo
burn, went to the office of Dr. Wilfred
E. Harris, in the Hotel Westminster,
and shot Dr. Harris three times.
Dr. Harris is dying in the City Hos- '
pital and Dr. Atwood is under arrest at
the Back Bay station on a charge of Bt*
tempted murder.
The buicide of the woman doctor is
given as the motive for the shooting by
Atwood. In a confession to-night, the
police say, he deelared his fiancee told
him a few days ago that she would not
rnarry him, and gave as one of the rea- j
sons her betrayal by Dr. Harris.
One Was Instructor.
All concerned ir. the case are osteo
paths. It was while the woman and
Dr. Atwood were students at the Massa
chusetts College of Osteopathy in Cam- |
bridge six years ago that they fell in
love. At that time Dr. Harris was
president of the college and an in?
structor of both of them.
Dr. Atwood was captured in the office.
Of Dr. Adams, in the Coolidge Corner
Building, in Brookline. He had sum- ;
moned the brother of the girl to meet
him there to learn something "of grave
importanee." After the shooting, the
prisoner says, he left the hotel and
went to Newspaper Row, where he saw
the firsl bulletins of the affair. He |
then attended a moving picture show.
and returned to the bulletin boards and
read the late details. From there hc ,
went to Brookline and met the girl's
brother, Wmthrop Adams.
The shooting itself was nensational.
Dr. Harris entered the hotel a few sec
onds before Dr. Atwood arrived. At?
wood asked the cierk if Harris was in,
and Harris araa pointed out as he was
entering the elevator to be taken to
his orhces.
Shot as Door Opened.
Atwood waited for another elevator
and followed Dr. Harrii to his office.
Dr. Harris was preparing to see. two
women patients who had been waiting,
but when there was a knock on the
door he opened it.
Atwood drew a revolver and fired five
shots without a word. Three of them
struck I?r. Harris, and as he topple.1

with the butt ofthe gun.
No one s-aw Atwood leave the build?

Baltimore, July 18. The big subma
rir.c Deut.vchlan.l may leave Baltimore
at any hour, or she may await at Nor?
folk the arrival of her sister submersi
ble, the Bremen, before making a dash
for the Atlantic. Captain Koenig is j
said to be desirous of exchanging in
fenaatiea with the Bremen's com?
mander.
Ambassador von Bcrnstorff sent a
large package of letters and documents
by an attache to Captain Koenig to-,
day, and the captain placed them in
the safe in his cabin. Then the Deutsch?
land began taking on oil for fuel, two
tank cars being on the pier.
With lf>,26i. gallons of fuel oil going
into her tanks and the nir.ety-tive tons '
of oil already in them, the I?eutsch
laad will have sufficient fuel for lS.OOO
miles, enough to permit her to deviate '
greatly from her course. The directi
run is a little over 4,0.00. miles.
A portion of one of the engines of
the submarine has been taken out and
Ifl undergoing repairs.
Mr. Prusse, the constructor nf the
submarine, who came over as a mtm- .
ber of he crew, will remain here.
When the Deutschland arrived, it was
said he was supercargo, and would re
BMla to supenntend the loading of
other submersibles.
To Build I'nited States Boats.
It was said, however, that vessels of
fhe type of the Deutschland would be
built here by a company now forming,
with American capital, and would oper
ate between Baltimore and points in
Germany, possibly Bremen. Mr Prusse
will have, it is snid. entire charge of
their construction. They will sail un?
der the American flag and he registered
It was said here to-day there was no
longer any doubt about the coming of a
gigantic Zeppelin. It is due about
August 15 and will ]and near this eity.'
The company operating the merehant
submarines is interested in the Zep?
pelin project, hut its representatives
will not talk about it. A landing place
is now being arranged. The exact lo
cation is being carefully guarded by
those interested.
Stayed Ip Four Daya.
The Zeppelin, which has been spe?
cially constructed for the trip across
the oc^an, is now completed and un
dergoin,* trial tests in Germany, ac?
cording to Germans here. It was said
this particular Zeppelin had succeeded
in staying in the air several thousand
feet above ground lor four days.
This is sufficient time to allow the
big airship to complete the round trip
between Germany and the United '
State.*, as it is said she can cross the
Atlantic in forty-two hours. It is de-1
clared several ot these Zeppelins are
heiag built.
Captain Koenig was very busy to-day
aad said he had no time to talk to any |
one. He seemed anxious and a bit out j
of sorts, but later expressed his grati?
tude for the hospitable treatment he
and his men had received in Baltimore. ;
"Every one with whom I have come1
in contact," he said, "has been more
than kind to me, and on behalf of tne j
crew of the Deutschland I want lo say I
that we appreciate it. Your city offi?
ciais are most gracious gentlemen and,
did everything possible to make ouri
stay pleasant."
Annoyed at "Censorship."
In one particular Captain Koenig has
been d'.sappointed. He tried to get to
Berlin by way of the government wire-!
less station at Tuckerton, N. J., ? mes- ?
sage about his reception here, and
tried to get from Berlin some of the ;
kindly things the German newspapers ;
have said about him and his crew. But,
the Tuckerton censor shut down tight
and nothing was allowed to go or to
come.
One message came from the Deutsehe

owns the Deutschland, congratulating
(apta-.n Koenig and his crew. Captain,

Amsterdam (via London), July 10.
The speech which the German Emperor
recently made to a gathering of army
chaplains at main headquarters ifl re?
ported in the "Vossiche Zeitung" by
Chaplam Dr. Ott.
"It ii a time of sifting," said the Em?
peror. "The world war is separating
the chaff from the wheat. You gentle?
men have the task of teaching the Ger?
man nation to take things seriously and
to accept the present as a time of trial.
lt is important to understand that lifo
Ifl a trial. We need practical Christian
ity to bring our lives into harmony with
the personality of our Lord. We must
live simply according to His acts and
deeds.
"Gentlemen, how fascinating and
marvellously manifold is His personal?
ity! We must study it thoroughly: we
live with the Lord.
"Suppose Christ entered at this mo
mer.t through yonder door. Could we
look into His face? Going to church
once a week is not enough. We must
?n|ke Him the ideal of our practical
ifis'we mtfst ?der-r*r;'-e to liv<- -u*c*.d
ing to His teaching. You must bring
sharply before us the vision of God,
Who perhaps, as the judge, is now pass
ing through the world. You must rep?
resent Him and show Him to us."
The Emperor then dwelt on what he
said he regarded as one of the most
dangerous tendencie? of the time?one
which might deprive the German na?
tion of the spiritual benefit of the war
namely, the tendency to find fault,
to ccmplain, to criticise.
"I often ponder how this tendency
can be cured," he added. "Certainly
not by repression, or laws or orders.
The remedy cannot come from outside
of us; it must come from within. There
must be peace in our hearts. Then we
will be strengthened for had days, and,
what is more difficult, for good days.
"The men who are now in the
trenches will return home different men
spiritually than when they left. Impre^s
upon them that they must retain in the
future the thoughts which fill them
now.
"Everybody must admit that our na?
tion is great, that it is without com?
plaint or hesitation, sacrificing every?
thing for a great cause. This is an in
spiration derived from God. Give the
men in the trenches my greeting, and
at the same time tell them how impor?
tant it is that they keep tirm reliancei
on God."
Kaiser Resents Way
America Uses Hyphen
The hyphen is keenly distasteful to j
Emperor Wiliiam. The Kaiser resents
the us? of the term "German-Ameri- i
can." He sees no reason for the
hyphenated dcsignation of sympathiz

country. When Judge Alfred K. Nip
pert, of Cincinnati, chairman of the
American Polish Relief Committee,;
chanced to use the term in a conversa
tion with the German War Lord on
the West Eront. June 24, the Emperor
did not hesitate to speak his mind. '
Judge Nippcrt hroucht tha message to
America yesterday, when he returned
un the Scandinavtan-American liner
Erederik VIII.
"There are Americans and Germans."
thfl Kaiser declared emphatically to ',
Judge Nippert, "but the two are sepa

BRITISH FIGHTING GREATEST BATTLE
OF NATIONS HISTORY. SAYS HAIG
London, July 18.?Representatives of organized labor decide
unanimously to-day to recommend that the August holidays be
postponed, so tbat the British army shall not face a shortage of
ammunition. Edwin Samuel Montagu, the new Munitions Miniflter,
read this letter from Sir Douglas Haig:
"At this mment we are engaged in the greatest battle the Brit?
ish army ever fought.. I feel confident if the workmen could aee
their comrades fighting here, both night and day, with heroism be?
yond all praise, they would not hesitate to surrender their two
days' August holiday.
"A two days' cessation of work in the munition factories must
have a most serious effect on our operations. It might even mean
an addition of many months to the war. The army in France looks
to the munitions workers to enable it to complete its task, and I feel
sure that this appeal will not be in vain. Let the whole British na?
tion forego any idea of a generjl holiday until our goal is reached.
A speedy and decisive victory will then be ours."

N. Y. FIRMS
Local Houses Chief
Offenders in Trade
Blacklist.
London, July 18. "The Official Ga
zette" published a list of eighty-seven
American individuals and firms placed
on the blacklist under the trading with I
the enemy act. Among th* names. all '
but thirteen are New Yorkers. Bank
ers and brokers, dealers in base and -
precious metals, in hides and in chem
Ic?la, and commission brokers who
ipaelaliaa in foods, are included.
The blacklist is supplementary to a'
previously compiled list in which the j
other neutral countries are represented. ?
In explaining the action of the Brit- |
ish government Laming Worthington '?
Evans, controller of the foreign trade
department of the Foreign Offleis, de
c' -ed thet ***? policy was "purelv a
1 piece of domestic legislation, which
' only interferes with trade, even in the I
case of the specified coneerns, by pro- i
hibiting persons domiciled in the Unit
ad Kingdom from dealing with these
coneerns."
Mr. Evans characterized the British ;
action as the exercise of the right of ;
the state to limit or control the trade
relations of its own subjects.
The list is made up largely, accord?
ing to Mr. Evans's statement, of Ger?
man firms with head offiee.s or control
in Germany German firms incorpora- ]
ted in the I'nited States, who are al
leged to have assisted Great Britain's
enemy by loans, propaganda or with
regard to contraband possible agents r
"for enemy firms resident in enemy
territory," and those who have abused
cable facilities by the employment of
secret codes in a "particular interest."

FIGHT IS BEGUN
WITH A STORM
OF GAS SHELLS
London Reports Heavy
Engagement on New
British Front.
BATTLE TO SAVE
ALBERT PLATEAU
1 Teutons Win New Hold in
Biaches, but Are Foreed
to Retire.
[Br TaMa tfl "The TrtNjna 1
London, July 18.?In a storm cf
gas shells, the Germans began a
fierce counter attack against Gen?
eral Haig's line to-day. Ihe. battle
is still in progress, according to an
official statement issued at midnight
to-night.
The steady advance of the British
troops threatens the Albert plateau.
So serious has this menace become
that the Kaiser's forces, drawn up
before the third line of defence, are
assailing the enemy line vigorously.

Poiseres is now only a dent in the

[ British line. The capture of a 1,500
yard front north of Bazentin Mon?
day cut it off on the East. The
capture of 1,000 yards of trenches
north of Ovillers last night cut it of?
i on the west,
The eity lies in ruins. Into its bat

French Line Attacked.
Along the French line the Germans
are attacking in an attempt to drive
back Foch's men before another blow
for Peronne can be struck. They suc?
ceeded in winning a new hold in
Biaches, on the Somme, a mile from
Peronne, but, according to the French
statement to-night, were foreed out
again.
Meanwhile, raids similar la those
whieh preceded the first Allied attack
are proving the German defenees all
along the line.
"At numerous points along the north?
ern front," says Berlin, "enemy patrola
were repulsed by our defence."
The British statement tells of aue
cessful enterprisea like those in B?l
gium and in Northern France. And the
Belgian War Office announced to-night
that north of Dixmude a detachment
had penetrated the enemy trenches,
killing the greater part of the occu
pants.
These activities are interpreted hera
as indicating that an attack north of
the present battle front ii contem
plated. The German salient, which
projects now from Arras to Ovillers,
is being gradually reduced by tha
drive northward from the Bazentin
line. A thrust south from Arras would
suceeed in pinching the Germana out
of this position more speedily.
Aim to Extend Front.
The advance north of Ovillera is of
considerable tactical value to the Brit?
ish. General Haig haa been aiming to
extend his front, which is still too nar?
row to make sure a break :n the Ger?
man third line when the assault ll re
aumed.
Thus. the British commander ii work?
ing to redeem by clever tactica what
was practically a failure in the firat
offensive on the northern end of tha
sector. Inatead of attempting a wedge
drive, with t-pectacular advancaa, Gen
eral Haig is widening his front from
tha centre.
Th'- counter at'acks on the French
aector had been anticipated. Though
forcfd to withdraw a *>hort distar..-*,
the French still hold a strong posi?
tion for another drive in the near
future. Because of natural as *?11
as artiftcial defenees. much prepara
tion is necesiary before Peronne ib
stormed
Heavy Armament Taken.
Military critics are agreeably sur
priaed by the large capturea of heavy
armament iicneral Haig, the Britiah
commander in chief, has been able to
announce. and point out how, although
the British attacks have been preaaed
with the greatest rapidity in order to
give the Germans no time to organize
formidable deft-nces, at the aame time,
as was evideneed by the withdrawal
of the Britiah from the Foureaux
wood. where they had reached the
German third line, (ieneral Haig wiae
ly resisted the temptation to hold oa
to that point, which would have in
curred severe fighting with prob
able heavy losses, in favor of a more
methodieal advance.
Evider.ce received from the front,
as well as the official map publishad
here, seems to prove that the German
aecon.i line of defence* waa far Uaa
strong and elahorate than the flrat;
hence the military observers helieve
that the obutacles are likely to be lesa
difficult as the Entente Allies adranee.
