At a meeting of the members of Mt.
Vernon Lodge, F. & A. M., last Wednes
day evening the report of the building
committee was presented. This report
referred mainly to the location of the
proposed Masonic Temple. Several sites
had been suggested, but the committee
were unanimous in reporting as the best
location, all things considered, the so
called Matthews lot on Portland street,
just below Drowne's block and adjoining
the Woodbury lot. The place can be
bought for $3100 and the lot is large
enough for a large building and would
leave a good building lot beside. The
lodge voted unanimously to purchase
this site and instructed the committee so
to do.
