CHIEF OF 'DRY
COPS' DOESN'T
WANT TO RUN
Saturday The Star publicly suggested that, in its opinion,
Sergeant Victor R. Putnam of the Seattle police department,
the fearless head of the "dry" squad, would make the best
sheriff King county could possibly elect at the coming election*
Putnam had not even thought of entering the race. Th«
Star's article came a# a complete surprise to him.
Then. Tuesday afternoon, he came to The Star office.
"I never ran (for office in my life," he said.
We knew that.
"It would be a hard fight, and I have no political or
ganization."
Wc knew that. too.
"It was nice of you to Apeak so kindly of me." he con
tinued, "and I appreciate it. But it's all rather sudden, isn't
it? Frankly, 1 can't say whether 1 ought to run or ought
not to. <>f course, there's a good deal a man could do in
the county- and 1 should like to have the chance.
"Rut it's this way: I've been on the police force now
for 12 years. As sheriff, I'd lose my standing there. If I
should have to get back to the force, it would be like starting
all over There is the police sick and relief fund, for
instance None of us can tell when our health may give out.
\s sheriff. I'd lose 12 years' interest in this fund.
"1 have a family- a wife and two children. I am not
well-to-do. So. you see. there are several matters to consider."
AND THAT'S HOW THK MATTER STANDS NOW.
Putnam is not a professional politician—and he hesitates
to become a candidate.
The Star feels that, more than ever, the county needs a
man like him who is not a |>olitician.
It isn't often in these days that the office seeks the man.
It is rather refreshing to find the people have a chance
to put into office one who has not trimmed and hedged to
please the professional politicians.
It is refreshing to feel that a man who is known to
"shoot square" has a chance to get public recognition without
the usual "pull" of politics.
The sheriff's office pays $2,200 a year It is not a great
deal to a "square shooter." It is not much more than Put
nam is now earning. It would, no doubt, be somewhat of
a sacrifice for him to give up an assured position for the
uncertainties of politics.
Still he'd be just the man for sheriff—wouldn't he?
