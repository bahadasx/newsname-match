COUNTY LEGISLATION,
Some Agitation Over the Increase of Val
ues and Tax Raise.. Taxes May
Be Reduced Next Year as
Less Will Be Needed.
The quarterly term of county court
adjourned about noon Tuesday of last
week a ter disposing of all business
before them. Considerable time was
consumed Monday morning with talks
relative to the recent assessment ot
property, which showed an increase oi
a lictle less than one million dollars.
In discussing the matter it developed
that some persons feel that the assess
ment of last year should have been
used and a special levy made to meet
the interest on the $200,000 road bonds
recently sold, which amounts to $10,
000. Uwing to the fact that the sale
of the bonds was considered problemat
ical, no provision had been tmade to
meet the interest on same for this
year, which means that the county
starts this fiscal year behind $10,000.
The tax assessment as fixed by the as
sessor and reviewed by the board of
equalization provides for the necessary
funds for paying the interest of $10,000
on the road bonds next year, hence the
assessment had to be made sufficiently
large to take care of the funds that
must be borrowed either from some
other department of the county finances
or from some bank or individual.
That means that the assessment this
year must provide $20,000 fur payment
of interest on the road bonds, but next
year the assessment will not need to
be more than Half the amount of this
year, tar as Interest on the $200,000
in road bonds goes. That should and
would mean a reduction in the tax rate
next year or a reduction on assessed
valuations.
After considerable discussion no
change was attempted, as it was clear
that any such move would be contrary
to the law. Any relief that property
owners get fom the assessment as now
fixed will have to come after making
application to the state board.
judge G. P. Burnett made his quar
terly report and incidentally explained
the tax situation and stated that after
having gone over the situation very
carefully with Trustee James Smith
they had found that the tax rate for
this year must bo $2.00 on the $100 val
uation, in the aggregate, in order to
meet the needs of the county.
Judge Burnett stated that he had
drawn a warrant for $5000, to pay the
interest on the $200,000 road bonds, but
as there was not that amount in the
Fike bond fund it would stand over
drawn until such a time as the collected
taxes for this year should overcome
the shortage.
The report of Judge Burnett shows
the bondedjndebtedness of the county
to be as follows :
Railroad $ 16,000
Court House 19,000
Pike 240,000
Total $275,000
There H in the Pike Bond sinking
fund a little over $1,000
H. K. Webb, as comiussioner of the
poor, submitted his report, which was
approved.
Superintendent J. 8. Cline made a
verbal report and stated that the school
board hoped to be able to run all rural
schools five months this year.
Dr. W A Reed made his report as
county physician and gave an itemized
account of expenses incident to an epi
demic of small pox that had prevailed
at Westel, but which was entirely
stamped out
I The bill was for $45.76. The court al
lowed 18.81 that had been paid for vac
cination points, but declined to allow
the remainder.
A bill was presented amounting to
about J 75 that had been made by Bill
Bledsoe while suffering with smallpox
at Westel, but the court declined to
pay same.
The following persons were released
from road work and payment of poll
tax because of physical disability:
Jackson Wyatt, Henry Barnwell. R. S.
Woody, William Whitlow, Vincent
Hamby.
C G. Black.made an itemized report
of all expenses by the Highway Com
mission the past quarter and showed
the amount that had been expended the
past quarter to be a little over $4,100
and the amount yet on hand to be a lit
tle over $194,000.
Esq. J. A. Frey made a verbal re
port for the committee appointed to
inspect the poorhouse and reported
same in good condition and oeing well
kept
Judge Burnett was authorized to em
ploy a janitor for the court houoe, jail
and the county property Hiram Wy

A. M. Davis was elected to till out
the unexpired term of R. E. Hamby,
who recently resigned as road commis
sioner for the first district.
Andy Elmore was elected a notary
public.
Fifty dollars was appropriated by
the court to assist in meeting expenses
incident to holding a county fair, pro
vided said funds were needed.
The committee appointed to fix the
tax lew for this year made both ma
jority and minority reports. The ma
jority report favored a tax levy aggre
gating $3.00 on tbe ifiuu valuation.
The minority report favored an aggre
gate levy of $2.00 on the $100 valua
tion. After a full discussion tne
minority report was substituted for
the majority report and adopted, ine
levy by items is :
State 35

tensive list of property comprising er
roneous assessments, doubles, etc.,
from which he requested the court to
release him. It was ordered that the
releases be made as requested if the
Revenue Committee approved of same
after proper investigation.
Getting the Better of an Invention.
Very wrong verdicts are come to by
people who use modern inventions in
the wrong way. The moving staircase
at the Embankment station offered a
proof of this, says the Manchester
(Eng.) Guardian, A country woman
was seen trying to ascend the de
scending side of the moving staircase
there. There was no official about,
and after two plucky attempts she at
last made progress and doggedly
worked her way up to the top. Some
people who saw her efforts waited for
her at the top. When she recovered
her breath she said: "Sh, I don't
think them movin' staircases all the
talk's about Is any better than the old
lift!"

A VISIT TO THE "HILL."
Editor Finds Wideawak Farmers and
Good Crops in the Pleasant
Hill Neighborhood.
Through the courtesy of Clinton An
derson and Herbert Smith, tbe editor
of tne Chronicle was privileged to en
joy a most delightful visit to the Fleas
ant Hill neighborhood Saturday and
Sunday. We found Pleasant Hill to
bs a neat little village of 200 people
who have been influenced to gather
there by the excellent advantages offer
ed for schooling their children at
Fleas&nt Hill Academy. Almost the
entire population depends on farming
foi a livelihood and the class of farm
ing that is being done by most of them
spells success in a very pronounced
way.
We were entertained at the pleasant
and hosoitable home of Clinton Ander
son, where we received every courtesy
and mark ot kindness and good feeling
that any person could ask and even
mors.
Herbert Smith and Clinton Anderson
have been looking after the Pleasant
Hill Academy farm for several years.
They are both enthusiasts on the ques
tion of crimson and other clovers and
legume crops in general.
Owing to pressure of his home farm
ing, Mr. Smith resigned as farm man
ager for the Academy the tirst of June.
It was with much regret that Prof.
W. E. Wheeler, principal of the Acad
emy, accepted his resignation, but as
Mr. Anderson still remained with the
institution the loss of the services ot
Mr. Smith was not so severely telt as
would otherwise :jjve been the case.
These two gentlemen have been work
ing in the utmost harmony bui'ding up
the Academy iarm by turning under
crimson clover and legume crops.
When these gentlemen took hold of the
farm about rive years ago there was
very little of the 130 acres that had
good fences, only a small portion of
the land was in even a passable state
of cultivation and much of it was badly
run down and wasned with deep gullies.
They at once began to grow legumes,
plow deep, till up the gullies and rotate
the crops in such a way as to immedi
ately start the farm on the road to fer
tility. They have now 50 acres in a
tair state of fertility. A considerable
portion of it is now producing excel
lent crop9 and those portions not yet
improved to the point where good aver
age crops can be produced are being
rapidly brought to a better state of
fertility by turning under rye and
crimson clover.
Mr. Anderson showed us an excellent
piece of corn where only three years
ago the land was considere.. worn out1
and worthless because it was so poor
and full of gullies. By deep plowing
and turning under crimson clover he
has it where he will get an excellent
crop of corn and its future improve
ment is a comparatively easy task.
Mr. Anderson may almost be said to be
a crank on the question oi turning un-
der crimson clover, but any person who
Will learn what he has done by that
means will readily admit "there is
method in his madness. " Mr. Ander
son is certainly entitled to be classed
as one of our most capable and suc
cessful farmers.
Herbert Smith and father, N. J.
Smith, have been doing a class of
farming with new land that . hould in
terest deeply every person in this coun
ty who is trying to get their new land
into grass and thus raise it to a higher
state of fertility.
They have a piece of new land that
is now growing clover more thap waist
hign that has bad no lime, that pro
duced a good crop of oats last year,
which was the first crop it produced
after being cleared. The land was not
plowed but was disced thoroughly,
sown in oats and seeded to grass at tbe
same time. Last year a ton of good
hay was cut to each of the three acres
in the piece. This year it will produce
two tons to the acre or more. The
only fertilizer it has ever had was 100
pounds of acid phosphate. This is only
nvpraee mountain land. All in all tne
methods employed by Messrs. Smith
are the most successful and advanced
that have come under our notice for
handling new ground.
HEDGECOTH BRC HERS
We also visited tbe home of Hedge
coth Brothers, where we ro-ind three
active and bright young men who are
doing good fanning but they feel that
they are tar from the goal they are
seeking and are very eager to learn of
better farming methods. They are
going in for lime, clovers and legume j
crops in connection with live stock.
When one listens to the eagerness
with which they discuss farming
methods and understands how they are
grasping at the most scientific meth
ods known there is ample evidence that
they are bound to win a rousing suc
cess by builidng up one of the most
valuable farms in the county.
JOHN A. FREY FARM.
Of the several farms around Fleas
ant Hill we saw none that presented
quite such splendid opportunities for
rapid improvement as the farm owned
by Esq. John A. Frey. He has 60
acres cleared and free from stumrs
and is rapidly getting it into clover.
Adjoining his cleared land he has sev
eral hundred aces in timber that lays
equal to any prairie land, which means
that the size of his farm need only be
limited by his ability to ubdue the
forest growth. We know of no place
in the county that quite equals it, all
things considered. While Mr. Frey is
doing good farming he diu not seem to
be fully conscious of the wonderful ad
vantages that his farm presents.
THE ACADEMY.
Pleasant Hill Academy usually has
an enrollment of 300 to 400 students.
Tne work it has done in past years is
wcrthy ot the highest commendation.
It is easy to see that it has done much
for the people ot that section for you
find them intelligent, well-behaved and
in sympathy with every movement
that makes for better homes, better
farms, higher living in its truest sense
and a desire to encourage the develop
ment of this wonderful section where
land is so cheap and homes can so easi
ly be obtained.
To feed the large body ot students
that attend the Academy it requires
fully 400 bushels of Irish potatoes, 100
bushels or more sweet potatoes and
fruits and garden products in like pro
portion. Last year enough Irist. and
sweet potatoes were grown on the
Academy farm to furnish the institu
tion and sell 100 bushels Irish and
about half as many sweet potatoes.
Fully 1,000 gallons ot fruit and vege
tables are canned each year at a very
much less expense than it could be
bought for and practically all of which
id grown on the Academy farm. Five
cows are kept besides several head of
young cattle and many hundred pounds
of good beef is furnished the school at
small cost. Two teams of mules are
also kept for 1 arming and hauilng sup
p'ies ot wood, coal and other things.
Even a hurried survey of the situation
as was taken by the writer shows
clearly that the Academy farm is a
large factor in reducinc the cost of
running the school.
Plans are being considered for add
ing to the institution an agricultural
department whereby a young man
may enter Pleasant Hill Academy and
after a few years of close i pplication
come out not only we',1 equipped with
a fair general education, but prepared
to take charge of a farm and conduct
same successfully. Many persons who
have watched the work of the institu
tion feel that the time is now at hand
when the greatest work the school has
ever done lies before it through an
agricultural department that will fit
young men to till the soil after the
most modern methods. With many
thousand acres of idle land that can
surely be converted into valuable
farms and happy homes there should
be a determined effort put forth by
Plasant Hill Academy and similar in
stitutions to encourage agriculture as
one of the surest and safest ways to
make useful citizens of our young
people.
ALBERT RAMSAY.
I The story of our visit would not be
complete if we should omit to speak of
the farm of Albert Ramsay. He nas
a small farm that be purchased a few
years ago for $500. It was considered
so poor and run down that some people
thought he had practically lost bis
money in making the purchase.
He recently refused $1,500 for it and
it would very likely bring more than
that if it were offered for sale. The
house is neatly painted, the fences are
all high and strong and his crops come
the nearest being weedless of any we
have ever seen. On every hand there
are evidences of thrift and care. He
showed us a few acres ot corn that was
planted June 22 and it is now shoulder
high and so free from wees that ha
miKht almost offer a reward to any
person who would find one in the field.'
We have never seen a crop that was
auite so uniform, was so free from
weeds and showed greater evidences of
successful farming. His farm is the
talk ot the neighborhood and he takes
a keen delight in making it all that one
could wish in a farm home. More
farmers such as Mr. Ramsay is is one
of the most valuable things that could
come to our county.
DAMAGE BY STORMS.
Territfie storms have swept different
parts of five states, North Carolina be
ing the worst sufferer. Thre are i9
persons reported missing with eight
known dead and a property loss ot six
to ten millions.
No trains left or entered Asheville,
N. C, for 24 hours. The electric pow
er was put out of commission and gas
oline sold tor a dollar a gallon. Hun
dreds are homeless in Asheville and in
many instances their homes have been
washed away. Roughly speaking the
Hooded aea extends from East Ten
nessee through southwestern Virginia,
through North Carolina and embraces
virtually all ot South Carolina. The
raging waters from North Carolina are
passing into South Carolina by the riv
ers and there is grave danger of serious
losses by the rivers getting far out of
tanks and flooding the country.
GEKMANS LOSING.
The armies of the allies have contin
ued to press back the German lines on
almost al fronts and many German
prisoners have been taken. Fighting
has been terriffic on all fronts and at
many points and the losses of life are
said to surpass anything yet known
and to be stunning in their enormity.
FAIR COMMITTED WILL MEET.
There will be a meeting of the Cum
berland County Fair Association July
22nd, at J. o'clock, p. in., to set date of
fair and to transact such business as
may come before the committee. All
persons interested in the fair aro in
vited to attend.
Harry Martin, chairman. .
About twenty persons gathered at
the Bishop home Friday evening to lis
ten to a talk by Rev. J. B. Spiers of
the New Jerusalem church, and enjoy
a social time. The evening proved one
oi great enjoyment to those present.
Light refreshments were served.
J. B. Southard has been appointed as
election commissioner to lill the vacan
cy caused by the refusal of G. C. Peek
to qualify.
If you want score cards and pencilsr
paper napkins, nice writing paper cut
to special size come to the Chronicle
office for them.
GETTING ALONG FINE
Mrs. J. H. Beeson, who was taken
to Knoxville last week to be treated
for a broken thigh, is getting along
splendidly and her full recovery seems
assured.
Upon arriving at Linclon Memorial
hospital an X-rav picture was taken
and the thigh bone was found to be
broken as Drs. Reed and Lewis
thought. The bone was set and an
other X-ray picture taken to determine
if all was right. The picture showed
that the bone had been set pertectiy.
Mrs. Beeson will probably have to re
main in the hospital for several weeks
hefore she can be brought hoie with
entire safety. Her many friends here
are much gratified to know she is get
ting along so wen ana un sue ww
restored to health.
