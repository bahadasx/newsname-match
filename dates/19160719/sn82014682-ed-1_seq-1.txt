I Search For ;Men Who Left in
vLaunch Saturday Proves
; , of No Avail
, The five Fort Shafter soldiers who
were last seen 9aturday morning
when they took boat at Puuiki for
Pearl Harbor as told yesterday in the
Star-Bulletin'- - are still missing and
military authorities have given up
hepe for their recovery although they
are still making every conceivable ef
fort to find them.
Every 'Japanese newspaper today
bears advertisements Inserted by
Deputy Sheriff Asch asking all fish
ermen to watch for a boat like the one
tconght.tb be iost and every fishing
company that operates boats near
Honolulu has. been notified by the
deputy to watch for the soldiers or
their craft and report at once any dis
covery. Last night tae naval tug Navajo
and the lighthouse tender Columbine
searched the waters about "Kaena
Point with searchlights and sent
binding parties into the coves with
no success. The men not only have
disappeared but they, have covered
their trail completely. Today the
searching parties have continued their
work farther - out from land in the
waters southwest of Kaena Point
Not even a surmise of the soldiers'
fate can be obtained from the Fort
Shafter officers. They only believe
the men are gone forever which im
plies 'drowning. The deputy sheriff
thinks that If the men are lost they
were swamped and went down in the
heavy surf that ran off Kaena Point
Sunday. -
Officers declare the four privates
and the corporal were all responsible
men and were bringing the boat In
under orders from Puuiki where they
had been stationed as a part of the
surveying crew of 2. Cpl. William
O'Reilly and Pvta. Michael Clark and
Thomas W. Murphy have all been in
Comjany, I, Engineers Corps, for
some time. Tiie other two, Pvts.
Silas P. Blrdsall and Raymond W.
Rinkler, joined the army here just
this year.
It is thought there was rations i
the boat for two days and there is a
bare possibility that the men might
have tried for one of the other isl
ands. Although officers say the boat
could make the trio in an ordinary
sea they scout the Idea. Even if they
had gained another Island they surely
would have wirelessed -here they
were, the officers say.
None of the men has any known
relatives in Honolulu.

San Francisco Paper Tells of
Project for Building to
Have 1000 Rooms
That the project of building and
conducting a great tourist hotel In or
near Honolulu Is taking on more def
inite form is Indicated from further
mainland reports. In its edition of
July 8 the San Francisco Bulletin
vntpr.ihe head lines oi "1700.000
Hotel for Honolulu" publishes the fol
lowing: "The continued absence of Temple
ton Crocker in Honolulu developed
the fact today that tentative plans
exi6t to build through a Hawaiian
and San Francisco syndicate a new
tourist hotel In. or near, Honolulu
with a thousand rooms, at a cost of
$700,000.
"Capt William Matson of this city
and Louis W. Hill of St. Paul, both
of whom are greatly interested in
the islands -because of the many pas
sengers their steamers carry " be
tween this port and Honolulu, are to
be in the hotel pool, or syndicate.
Hill Now Considering
"J. C. Gilman of Portland,. Ore
Hill's railroad and steamship presi
dent on the Pacific coast has the mat
ter before Mr. Hill now. .
"Templeton Croclcer, his mother-in-law,
Mrs. W. G. Irwin, and his sister,
Mrs. Jennie Whitman, are also to
join the syndicate, as well as Robert
Shingle, and several others of the
surar millionaires of the islands.
When the Hill fcteamers. Great
Northern and Northern Pacific, were
carrying crowds of Easterners all
last winter to the islands, the neces
sity for a 1000-rooni modern hostelry
was seen.
Under St Francis Management
"The promise of Hiil and Gilman to
have a regular winter service gave
the proposition added impetus, and
now Templeton Crocker and his rela
tives have become interested in it,
especially in view of- the fact that
the members of the pool wish the
new hotel to be under the direction
of the St. Francis hotel management
of this city.
"It Is definitely known the owners
of the St Francis are only to be part
owners of the new Honolulu hotel,
presumably holding one of six differ
ent syndicate stock holdings."

Indications German Submarine
Will Sail For the Open
Sea Shortly
(Associated Press by Federal Wireleea)
BALTIMORE, Maryland, July 19
Loading of the submarine Deutsch
land has been completed and the pier
at which the craft is lying has been
screened from the public. Every ef
fort is being made to extend to the
submarine the protection of a belliger
ent merchant-vessel in neutral port
Capt Koenlg has cancelled some
social engagements which he had
made for the next few days, indicat
ing that the submarine is getting
ready to depart
That the British patrolling cruisers
will fire upon the Deutschland if the
submarine is sighted by them is the
substance of a report sent by the
International News Service from
Washington on the night of July 11.
The report says:
' WASHINGTON, D. C, July 11
British naval vessels will fire upon
the German submarine liner Deutsch
land 'at sight It will be treated as
a warship regardless of any ruling
the United States government may
make.
"If the Deutschland is destroyed by
a British warship the State Depart
ment will make no inquiries.
"These facts were made plain at
the British embassy and at the State
Department today.
"The British and French embassies
protested to the State Department
against this government's action in
permitting the Deutschland to enter
an American port. They protested
also against permitting the Deutsch
land to take on provisions. They de
clared to the State Department that
the Deutschland is a warship ana ,
therefore Is entitled to none of the j
rfghts enjoyed by a peaceful mer-.
chantman. I
-At the BriU.h Embassy the posl-
lion or me uriiinu gurerumeui wao
outlined as follows:
"In " view of the methods of the
submarine warfare employed by Ger
many in the present war, the Deutsch
land must be considered as a war
vessel. '
"Xo enemy vessel moving under the
water can be considered by Great
Britain as anything but a warship,
and it will be treated accordingly. It
would be absurd to treat a submarine
vessel any other way.
