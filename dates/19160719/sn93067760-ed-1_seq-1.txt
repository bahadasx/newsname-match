Damage to bridges In Union county

entertained for the safety of Lockhart
cotton mill, where the river has broken
beyond its banks and established a
new channel.
Citizens visiting the banks of the
Catawba river report many bales of
cotton floating down stream. It is
hothught possible that these come from

are situated on the river.

'i'he city board or health has been
considering for sen1 tneile step's to
ward iitprovlitg the sanitary ('ondi
t.ions of the eity. To this end the board
invited Ilir. W. Ml. Itouthll of thre state
board of health, to appear before a
jloint meeting of t he city board of
health and city conlcil .\ionday. )r.
Routh. who is a recognized authority
in these inatters, gave an instrti(tive
talk. when the Imeet lig was; belI. lie

of introducing this work in th' (ounlty

sanitaton inl the schools and p11e rmit

give illustrated lectures showing the
dangers of soil pollution. fly contamr
ination and other ways whereby dis
ease is disseminated. )r. Routh re
(1iuests that. trustees write himt or ton
suilt him about holding such meetings.
le will 'exhibit. a model which Ih.e
State Board of lealth has endorsed
and which he is trying to get, adopted
all over the state.
A member of the board of health
yesterday had the following to say of
Dr. Routh's lectures: "These illus
trated lectures are highly entertain
luE, instructive and practical, not
alone from the sanitary viewpoint, but
as a qiuestion of civic pride. The
economic loss from preventable dis
eases costs Laurens county many
thousands of dollars yearly. Tile pre
vention of diseases in progressive see
tions is occupying more thought than
the question of curing diseases, since
it is a reflection on the intelligence of
a community to have ' troubles the
c'a use of 11whih can he eradleated."
