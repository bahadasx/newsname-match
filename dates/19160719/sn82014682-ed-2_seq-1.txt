"PROGRESSIVES" HOLD
THEY HAVE BEEN DUMPED
Say Reactionaries in Late Con
vention Put Over Eleventh
HourDeai Resignation or reorganization!
ThesV alternatives developed late
yesterday and early today Ha tbe new
Republican . ' territorial : central and
executive committees, named at the
close of the platform convention Mon
day night.
EmU A. Berndt, the new party chair
man. Is on the vergeot presenting his
v.; resignation, believing that: the Pro
gressive members on the central com
mittee are so outnumbered by . the
; -other side" that he is not Justified
in trying to handle - tbe . territorial
campaign. : .
Friends of Gen-it . P. Wilder, the
. new party treasurer, wno was elected
after his departure for Maul Monday
afternoon, are writing him. outlining
the : situation and Intimating that he,
too, may wish to resign.
' Only the hope i that a wholesale
resignation . on tho; part of the so
called "'reActlonaries"' will allow a re
organization of the committee has
kept the "progressives", from a state
- ment, through - Chairman Berndt,
which will crystallize their attitude. ,
r : a statement given , out . yesterday
afternoon by Alfred V. Cooper, vchair-
man of the late platforjn committee,
and published id the second edition
'' of the Stxr-Bulletln. Indicated that un
less there would a reorganization; ",of
. the committee there, would be om
resignations of, the "progressives;"
s , Cooper said today .that he has . had no
- yeason , to change; Jils v sentiment in
" v. this respect:rf !b.-v r-: '
V ; ; Meanwhile party -peacemakers are
r trying to stare - off the threatened
;7 resignations. Walter Coombs and
John H. Wlses would like to . see
Berndt remain, as chairman and are
" .hoping that somehow reorganization
f. can be effected to which, he will con-
. cent - -:. - - VVv'
- Some of the Republicans talked to-L-,
. day with Harry Murray, -who Is re
. " warded as leader" of the group which
controlled the , election of committees
.' Monday night. Murray declares that
V ; there was no "slate" tued to shut out
Raymond C. Brown, Alfred Eames and
ethers. He scouts the accusation that
he was one of 'the leaders of a fourth
and fifth district combination which
put through a slate. , ': '
Early this afternoon it .was a matter
of - conjecture whether Chairman
Berndt would resign before night, or
- remain In office on promise of a re
organized committee to back him up.

STUART'S LETTER
PARTLY UPHELD
BY MWDLESS
He :Miaht Have Said Same
Things to Some Extent, But
in Different Way
'I might have said the same things
to some extent but in a different
way," said Lincoln L. McCandless.
McCandless, who has been mention
ed both as Democratic candidate for
mayor of Honolulu and as candidate
for the delegateship, has assumed a
definite attitude with regard to the
letter sent to the president by Cir
cuit Judge T. B. Stuart the full text
of which was published in the Star
Bulletin Tuesday.
While McCandless' opinions on the
Stuart communication, as given the
Star-Bulletin today, are purely per
sonal, it la thought likely they will car
ry weight In any definite stand which
may be. taken by that faction of the
local Bourbon party of which McCand
less Is the undisputed leader.
McCandless' personal opinions as
to the Stuart letter, which are self
explanatory, follow:
Responsibility Is Disclaimed
"Anything which Judge Stuart may
have done was the result of his own
Ideas. i We had nothing to do with
the letter which he wrote to the presi
