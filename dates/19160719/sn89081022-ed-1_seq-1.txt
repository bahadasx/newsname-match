JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL
BUILDING PROPOSED
Annual School Meeting Was a
Harmonious Event. No
Change on Board.
At the annual school meeting of In
dependent School District No. 47 held
Saturday evening plans for the pro
posed new Junior High School build
ing were discussed ana Charles B.
Carlson and Victor E. Lawson were
unanimously re-elected as members of
the Board of Education for three
years.
About fifty people braved the sultry
state of the atmosphere last Saturday
evening to attend the annual school
meeting. And they were very good
natured at that, for a more peaceful
school meeting was never held at
Willmar.
After the reading of the call and
minutes of the last annual meeting,
the financial report was read. Owing
to the new elaborate system of book
keeping devised by the State Educa
tional department, the summary state
ment is more in detail than has been
the case heretofore. It has the ad
vantage of being uniform throughout
the state.

Respectfully submitted,
C. B. CARLSON,
Treasurer of Independent School
District No. 47, Willmar, Minn.
The financial statement was accept
ed and approved by unanimous vote.
The building plans being worked
out by the Board of Education were
then discussed. Mr. William W.
Tyrie, of the firm of Tyrie & Chap
man, architects, of Minneapolis, then
showed on a screen the front elevation
and floor plans of the proposed build
ing by means of slides and the school
stereopticon.
The proposed building would be
erectedr along Fourth street and be
built in connection with the present
High School building. Its length
would be 150 feet and greatest width
74 feet. It would be known as the
Junior High School building, and
would accommodate about 325 pupils,
besides furnishing administration
rooms, a good gymnasium with need
ed adjuncts, and assembly room for
the entire school. The plans also
contemplate a central heating plant
directly south of the industrial build
ing which will heat all four buildings.
The halls of the new building would
connect with the halls' of the present
high school building, practically mak
ing it all one building.
The basement floor would contain
the gymnasium on the south end, and
the slope of the ground will give a
chance for a good high ceiling without
requiring much excavation and with
out disturbing the level of the first
floor.
The junior assembly room would be
on the south end of the first floor, and
would be designed to accommodate
the seventh, eighth and ninth grades.
The latter would correspond to the
Freshman class of the high school.
The three higher classes would use
the present high school room, and for
general school exercises would pass
into the gallery of the assembly room
on the same floor.
The junior high school idea has been
found very practical wherever tried
in retaining the children in school who
ordinarily would drop out when com
pleting the Eighth grade.
The first floor would also contain
the boys and girls locker rooms, the
Superintendent's office, and several
recitation rooms. The second floor
would provide eight recitation rooms,
besides the gallery for the assembly
room.
The building would be of fireproof
construction and! the estimated cost
would be $75i0O0. It would harmon
ize in architecture with the present
