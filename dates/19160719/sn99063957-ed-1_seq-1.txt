London, July 19. The Germans dented the British
line last night in their most successful counter attack
since the great allied offensive began.
The recapture of the village of Longueval, at the in
tersection of two highways seven miles south of Bapaume,
and of Delville Wood, was claimed in an official statement
issued by the German war office.
In an official report General Haig admitted the Ger
mans had obtained a footing'in the northern outskirts
of Longueval and had recaptured part of Delville wood.
The battle is continuing, General Haig reported, and has
become very violent. "
The Germans, however, led large forces against the
British right wing at about dusk, after an intense bom
bardment of Longueval village and the Delville wood.
As the German guns lifted, thick masses of German
infantry advanced to the attack. They swarmed forward
in the face of sheeted machine gun and rifle fire and ac
cording to the British official report suffered very heavy
losses. . Further east, repeated German attacks against
the Waterldt farm were repulsed.
Thus far the new battle north of the Somme is bemg
confined largely to the British right wing. The German
official statement claimed the repulse of attempts by the
British left to draw closer to the village of Pozieres and
also announced the defeat of French attacks southwest of
Peronhe.--?' 1 " 'v .. -w .., v , ......
' Dispatches from headquarters indicated the violence
of the German assault, but thus far have carried no re
port on the outcome, indicating that the battle" continued
throughout the night.
On the British left wing the method
ical advances made on both sides of the
Bapaume-Albert highway have menaced
the German hold on the village of Po
zieres, an important highway junction
uua tne local ODjective ot the British at
tack. By .pushing their lines forward
on both sides of the highway, the Bri
tish have thrown the town itself into a
deep pocket while artillery is steadily
reducing the German works to ruins.
At the same .time British gunners have
)nid a steady fire across the Pozieres
Thicpval road, oue of the highways over
which the Germnns in the Thicpval sa
lient draw their supplies.
Some interest is displnved in reports
of increased artillery activity on the
ullied front north of Saloniki. Rome
dispatches recently forecasted the be
ginning of an Anglo-French offensive
in the Bnlkans before the middle of
August.

The village which was captured by

Washington, .lulv 19. Although it
declared President Wilson will continue
vigorous efforts to modify the British
blockade, government officials have
practically lost hope of accomplishing
their purpose soon.
with adverse action bv the British
government on the president's repre
sentations for Red Cross shipments in
fo uermany ana rood into Poland and
with England's announcement of a
blacklist on certain American firms, it
was stated authoritatively today that
little hope is held for a satisfactory
culmination of the present diplomatic
intercourse. Another protest was sCnt
yesterday on the Red Cross situation.
Further appeals are pending ipr Polish
relief, and strong representations will
be made against the blacklist.' But a
high official of the government, and
a man close to the president aaid:
"These people (the allies) are in dead
earnest. They have their teeth set and
their eyes fix! on a given goal. They
are paying liitle attention to anything
else. They will accede to no demand
they believe might delay now reaching
the end they desire.
"And they have told us in almost
so many words that if we don't like
the smell of frying over there we'd
better keep out of the kitchen."

(United Press staff correspondent.) ...
St. Paul, Minn., July 19. Hundreds
of the snmo kind of "home town folk"
who make up the church boards, the
Chautauqua crowds and run the district
schools in thousands of towns and vil
lages, swarmed into St. Paul today for
the opening session of the prohibition
national convention.
Motherly old women, of the type that
attended the home and foreign mission
ary society meetings back home, and
bake cakes and make jellies for the pas
tor and society picnics, were in the
crowd. So were bearded gray-haired old
men in their black "Sunday go to
meeting" clothes, some of them with
collars and some of them who never
wore oue.
The delegates who came to St. Paul
imbued with the thought of downing
the demon rum are as different from
the crowds who attended conventions
of other political parties as the frock
coated city merchant is from the gnar
ly fisted, aproned store keener at Hicks
Corner, or any other cross road. - The
prohibitionists seem more earnest and
care leas for show. The women brought
their tatting, their knitting, and their
patchwork.
It was a hot day, aad costless, collar
less, suspender shewing shirts some
blue and some "boiled" dotted ' the
crowd at the Auditorium.
For instance, there was Col. James M.
Ingersoll of Pocatello, Idaho, a griz
zled, gray mustached ranchman, who
sat on the platform. His boiled shirt
was collarless, he wore no coat, but his
diamond stud illuminated his shirt as
no necktie could. His gray socks
came down over the tops of his squared
toed shoes and he twirled his mustache,
appearing like a gruff, ' good ecout,
dressed up in his Sunday clothes and
dreading it. Col. Ingersoll, the only
progressive leader attending the con
vention, was in the limelight continu
ously. Mrs. Kate M. Hamilton of Los
Angeles, Cal., who is 74 years old, and
has been a prohibitionist for 63 years,
was "grandmother" to many of the wo
men delegates who greeted her. She sat
near the platform, dressod in prim
white , with a bit of vanity expressed
in ear rings that bobbed as she nodded
her gray head.
The prohibitionists joiucd In the

San Fraucisoo. JUly IB. A crisis in

of the Longshoremen's association waa
faced by the stevedores and riggers here
today as the result of the refusal of
their fellows in other Pacific coast
ports to sanction the proposed compro
mise for settlement of the strike 'which
has tied up waterfront activities for
six weeks.
The vote of the outside unions which,
showed a majority of more than two to
one against acceptance of the compro
mise which the San Francisco longshore
men had alroady accepted, will be can
vassed at a meeting of the local union
tonight. District President J. J. Foley
and local President Murphy both denied
today that the local union contemplated
resuming work despite the vote. This
denial was called forth . by persistent
rumors that a number of local long
shoremen favored splitting with the
men in the other parts and making a
separate deal with the employers.
R. C. Thackara, spokesman of the
Waterfront Employers' Union, declared
that his organization, txpects the lo
cal stevedores to return to work, how
ever. "We gave the local longshoremen un
til Saturday to vote on our compromise
proposition," he said. "They accepted
it by a vote of almost two to one and
notwithstanding what stevedores in oth
