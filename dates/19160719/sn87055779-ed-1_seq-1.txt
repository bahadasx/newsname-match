AFI FIGHTS
MILT'S BOOM
Leader of Prohibition Con
servatives Works Hard
Against Indianan.
Internnti'tnnl News Sorviev:
ST. BAUD, Minn.. July 1?. With
many of the 1,254 accredited dele
at"s missing the prohibition na
tional convention formally pot under
way here today in perhaps the most
momentous meetip.K in the life of
the party.
Two paramount problems both of
which were brewed here in t. Paul
promised to make the sessions live
by. They arc the selection of a na
tional ticket, which has developed
some eleventh hour complications
:nd the proposition of changing the
party's name in the hope of attract
ing to its reformers from all parties.
It seemed certain today that
either William Sulzer, former gover
nor of New York, or ex-C.ov. Frank
J. Ilanly of Indiana, will head the
national ticket this fall. The Hanly
boom developed amazingly at sev
eral niuht meetings and his hackers
were promising when the convention
opened that he will ride to glory by
acclamation.
Uhaliti Against Hanly.
Against this Hanly tide, Kuprene
W. Chatin. the party standard bearer
for the last two campaigns, has
thrown all his strength, which in
cludes that of the "conservative" ele
ment of the party which he controls.
There is an intense personal feeling
between Hanly and Chafln which the
latter made no effort to conceal. 'T
will do anything to boat Frank Han
ly." was Chatin's. frank characteriza
tion of his position today. Working
asainst both these booms is agita
tion ben tin by National Treasurer H.
P. Faris of Missouri, for a "mixed"
ticket, man for presidential candi
date and a woman for vice presi
dent. The ticket proposed by Faris is
Dr. Ira Landrith of Nashville. Tenn.,
and Miss Marie 0. Brehm of Chi
cago. 'Never in the history of any
party." said Faris, "has a candidate
been selected from below the Mason
and Dixon line. "Dr. I-andrith could
sweep the south for us. 1 am con
fident. Fy putting Miss Brehm or
ome other nationally known woman
cn the ticket, we would be assured
of a large part of tne 4.000.000 votes
which are controlled by the women'.
party. It is th chance of a life
time."
Mil or Will Conic.
The Sulzer faction, headed by
Chafin. worked far into the niuht
and be-an again early today to cor
ral the delegates. Sulzer himself is i
hurrving here from Xew York to
aid them and his presence is expect
ed to do much towards turning the
tide in his favor. Hanly will not :
here. His campaign is being handled
by Oliver W. Stewart, his business
I artner.
A deal was concluded early today
between .Stewart and Virgil G. Hin
jshavv. national chairman, by which
the litter agreed to support Hanly
in return for Stewart's support for
Hin'haw's re-tlectiou us national
chairman.

MTU MEET
To Make Plans For Ball Cam

Initial plans for the coming cam
paign are to be made by the demo
crats at a meeting called lor Friday
night, at S o'clock, by County chair
man Frank Mayr, jr.. to be held at
the party headquarters, American
building. Precinct committeemen,
and members of the election boards
at the recent primary, are especially
urged to be present, and democrats
generally are invited.
A complete poll of the county Is
among the things to be arranged for
at this meeting. special commit
tees are also to be appointed for a
number of purposes. It is the plan
of the chairman and executive com
mittee to wage a vigorous campaign
this fall, and realizing that the re
publican campaign is to be one of
reliance on dollars rather than upon
party principles, the appeal to intel
lectual fairness and truth to be made
by the democrats, will probably re
sult in several of the biggest rallies
that have been held in South Bend
in 20 years. Some of the bigcest
speakers in the parry are promised
South Bend, among whom may be
Pres't Woodrow Wilson, though but
for a short stop.
It has haked out locally that
South Bend is one of the particular
spots in the state upon which Xa
tional Committeeman James Hem
enway has a weather eye for a con
siderable expenditure of the Wall
St.. boodle that he was named to se
cure for Indiana. It is expected that
South Bend. Ft. Wayne. Ter re Haute.
Fvansville, Indianapolis, Gary, Ham
mond, Indiana Harbor and F.ast Chi-

'with the Hemenway lucre. It is pos
; sibl that at the meeting Friday
