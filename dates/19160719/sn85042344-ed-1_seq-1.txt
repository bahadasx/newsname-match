discussion yesterday. A storm of pro
tests leached The World office, in
person and by mail. Most of theui
were directed at the police depart

in posed. one prominent citizen
called attention to the fact that in the
days when the city was "wide open"
the cry was raised that gambling
houses and bootlegging joints brought
criminals to the community and
were, therefore, the direct cause of
crime in all its phases. Now that

That Chief of Police Lucas and
Commissioner Funk are sincere In
their efforts to make Tulsa a "closed
town" can haidly be doubted by any
one. The only criticism that Is di
rt (led at them In this connection is
that they have confined all of their
otte ntions to regulating the bootleg-
gin? business and breaking up the
restricted district, while the liver, and
property of clti7ens have been practi
cal lv u ii protected.
The police officials come back at
the faultfinders with the assertion
that their lorce Is Inadequate In num
bers. I.ast night, for instance, but
tlneo uniformed patrolmen were on
uty in a city of 45,000 population.
Practically all of ho time of the
plainclothes force is confined to
se itching lor liquor and chasing pros
titutes fiom one part of the city to
another. In past years, it is pointed
out, when crooks came to town it
was a well-known fact that they con
gregated in certain places. where
they could usually be found. In many
instances the tointisis have co-operated
with the polico in an effort to pre
vent murderers, second-story men and
other criminals from plying their ne

WILSON INSISTS ON
CHILD LABOR LAW
Pays Personal Visit to

Wishes Known.
TALKS WITH KERN
His Advent on Scene Will
Not Necessitate Delay

WASIIINCiTON', July 1. Presi
dent Wilson made a personal
visit, to the eapilol today to emphasize
his desire that a child labor law be
put on the statute books it the pres.
ent session of congress. To senate
leaders whom he summoned to a se
ries of conferences in the presidents
room, adjoining the senite chamber,
he Insisted that the child labor bill
passed bv thn house should be made
a part of the legislative program to bo
put through the senate Diiore ad

Determined opposition ny soutnern
senators forced the house bill wtucn

out of the Imperative program drawn
hv the Democratic caucus last Satur
day. It was left In a secondary po
sition to be considered only If time
remained after other measures re
garded as more urgent had been dis
posed of. Mr. AVIIson had been told
that an effort to force its passage
would mean a serious parly revolt.
Whether the president's visit ac
complished anything more than to
Irlng his own position in the muner
emphatically to the front was not
apparent tonight. So far as could bo
lei.rncd the TVmors,tle steering com.

The president saw Senator Kern,
the malorltv leader: Vlce-1're-dent
Marshall. Senators Martin. Williams,
Jomcs and Owen of the Democratic
steering committee and Senators Sim
mens and Hughes. Senators Martin,
Williams snd Simmons are among
those lnclln1 to favor Ih") postpone
ment of action on the bill.
Those who saw the president were
reticent nbout the conference. Sen
ator Kern ai'.d so far as he knew the
president's visit would not necessitate
any delay in tne "onicmpiaica so
journment of congress. Some sena
tors who favor early aciton on ire mm
said they believed there should he
another caucus. Others Ivotrayed
some resentment at. the president's
request, pointing out that the senste
slttady had compromised with the
White llous-3 on tne legislative pru
rrm. the eauAis last week agreeing
to de'ay action on the Immigration
bill, which Mr. W11n opposes, hut
which has the support of a majority
of tre Democratic senators.
Mr. Wilson is said to have caneo

Dismisses His Appeal From
Verdict of High Treason
Against England.

Reprieve Which May

LONDON, July IS. Without hear
ing the attorneys for the crown
the court of criminal appeal today
dismissed Sir Roger Casement's ap
peal from the verdict of tho lower
court, which found him guilty of
treason, for which Viscount Heading
the lord chief justice, sentenced him
to death.
For a day and a half Alexander
Sullivan, Sir Roger's counsel, argued
before the court, quoting many au
thorities in favor of his contention
that the offense of treason depended
upon whether the accused dwelt tin
der the protection of the king and
that the crime could not be commit
ted without the realm. He abandoned
his other points in regard to the lord
chief Justice's definition of the offense.
As soon as Mr. Sullivan had con
cluded his argument, the court re-
tired to consider whether the attorneys
for the crown would be called on to
reply. It soon decided to the con.
trnry. Which Indicated tho appeal h.ia
pone against Sir Roger, who w.is pres

Judgment was given.

A further appeal to the house of
lords ii possible only if the attorney
general gives a certificate that the
decision of the court of criminal np
peal Involves a point of law so c
eentinnallv Important that it Is destr.
able in the public interest that a still
hlL-her court should deal with It.
Justice Darling, in delivering the
Judgment, expressed an Indebtedness
of the court to Mr. Sullivan for his
well considered arguments, as the J"
tlce characterized them, adding that
they were worthy of the best tradi
tions ofVhc king's court, but he de
clared they had been answered by tho
attorney's of the crown at the first
trial.
Atlorny Michael Francis Doyle ok
Philadelphia, of counsel for Sir Roger,
expressed an opinion today that It
was improbable the attorney-general
wo. ild certify the case for appeal to
the house of lords.
"Powerful influences are worklmr
for a reprieve," said the attorney,
"and there are strong hopes of one
being granted."
