lachrymose shells. The Germans

lines unite.

assault, bat thus far have carried no
report on the outcome. Indicating that

On the British left wing the meth
odical advances made on both sides
of the Bapaume-Albert highway, have
menaced the German hold on the vil
lage of Pozieres, an Important high
way Junction, and the local Objective
of the British attack. By pushing
their lines forward on both' sides of
the highway, the British have thrown
the town itself into a deep pocket
while artillery is steadily reducing
the German works to ruins. At the
same time British gunners have laid
a steady fire across the Pozieres
Thiepval road, one of the two high
ways over which the Germans In the
Thiepval salient draw their supplies,
rendering that line useless.

"What men among us ever expected

has not passed," said B. W. Garrett,
clerk of the Iowa supreme court in
his speech as temporary chairman In

dreds of the same kind of "home
town folks" who make up the church
boards, the Chautauqua crowds and
run the district Bchoola tn thousands
of towns and villages, swarmed Into
St. Paul today for the opening ses
sion of the prohibition national con
vention.
Motherly old women, of the tyje
that attend the home and foreign
missionary society meetings bacit
home and bake cake and make Jel
lies for the pastor's aid mciety pic
nics were in the crowd. So were
bearded, gray haired old men in their
black "Sunday go to meeting" clothes,
some of them with collars and some
of them who never wore one.
These delegates who came to St
Paul imbued with the thought of
downing the demon rum are as dif
ferent from the crowds who attended
conventions of other political parties
as the frock-coated city merchant is
from the gnarly fisted, aproned store
keeper at Hicks Corners or any other
cross rpad.
The pFohlbi UonTsts eeem more ear
nest, and caring less for show.
The women besought their tatting,
their knitting and their jafch worlt.
It was a hot day and coatless, co
larless, suspender showing shirts,
some of them blue and some of them
"boiled"—dotted the crowd at the
Auditorium.
For instance there was Colonel
mes M. Ingersoll of Pocat-vlo,
Idaho, a grizzled, gray mu3tached
ranchman, who sat on the platform.
His boiled shirt was coilarless, he
wore no coat, but his diamond stud
illuminated his shirt as no necktie
could. His gray socks game down
over the tops of his square toed
black shoes and he twirled the mus
tache, appearing like a gruff, good
scout, dressed up in his Sunday
clothes—and dreading it. Colonel In
gersoll, the only progressive leader
attending the convention was in the
limelight continually.
Mrs. Kate M. Hamilton of Los
Angeles, Calif., who is 74 years old
and has been a prohibitionist for
sixty-three yearB, was "grandmother"
to many women delegates who greet
ed her. She sat near the platform,
dressed in prim white, with a bit of
vanity expressed in earnings that
bobbed as she nodded her gray head.
This convention sings for amuse

marched and yelled. The prohibition

M. Thatcher, who positlvolv has toe

hymns and songs with the accom

The delegates seemed religious and
comfortable. There was no dressing
for style—but a lot of "amens" were
devoutely pronounced when the min

AUDITORIUM, ST. PAUl*
July 19.—The prohibition nation*^
convention got down to real politics
at opening session today. The fight
between J. Frank Hanly, of Indian,
and Wm. Sulzer of New York, for the
party's presidential nomination, de
veloped some old style wire pulling
and rough and tumble negotiations.
Sulzer was speeding to St. Paul, It
was stated, hoping to arrive here in
time to prevent Hanly adherents
from nominating their candidate one
day ahead of the scheduled time for
nomination. Sulzer men caucused
prior to opening the convention to
day and after counting noses, said
there were enough supporters of the
New Yorker to give Hanly a hot fight.
If Hanly is nominated, Virgil Hin
ehaw will remain chairman of the
national committee. Religious busi
ness was mixed Into the convention
again today. The American federa
tion of patriotic societies an anti
Catholic organization, which is sup
porting Sulzer, had many representa
tives on the ground. Prohibition,
woman suffrage and government
ownership of munitions plants were
advocated today in Daniel B. Polling's
opening keynote speech.
