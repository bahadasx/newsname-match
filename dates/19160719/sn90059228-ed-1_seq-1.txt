COUNTY FAIR
PRIZE WINNERS
Erhibitors Who Won the Ribbons at
the Marshall County Fair, Held
July 3, 4, and 5, 1916.
This week the Sheaf publishes the
!j?amfis of the prize winners at the
^Marshall county fair. The work of
compiling this list by Dr. E. T.
Frank, the able secretary of the fair
association, has been no simple mat
matter and credit due hime for ar
ranging the names for the benefit of
the Sheaf readers.
There were about 200 exhibitors at
the fair this year and each person
liad from one to twenty entries in the
different classes. In many depart-
ments there were more entries than
at any previous fair, especially is
this true of the live stock exhibits,
which were exceptionally good. The
exhibits in the culinary and art de
partments were good and the best
that'the house wife could produce
were shown. As this was the first
summer fair the agricultural exhibits
were not up to the usual standard,
but the fair officials look forward to
strong exhibits in this department at
the 1917 fair. y^

Respected! Farmer Has Passed Away.
Levi Olmstead Munger died at his
home near this city on July 15, 1916,
aged 69 years, 6 months and 20 days.
The cause of death was cancer of the
stomach from which disease he has
been suffering for some time. De
ceased was born December 25, 1846,
at Little Rock, Kendall county, Illi
nois. His parents were Rev. and
Mrs. O. W. Munger and he was the
fourth son of a family of five broth
ers and four sisters, all of whom
with his. aged parents have preceed
ed him in death, with the exception
of one sister Mrs. Susan Taft, who
resides at Stewart, Nebraska. He
was married January 23, 1868 to Miss
Amanda M. Keluy at Little Rock.
Six children were born to this union,
four of whom have passed away.
After marriage he lived for sever
al years near his birth place and in
the days of no railroads and facing
severe harships, he ventured across
country by wagon to Iroquois county,
Illinois, where he settled and lived
for several years not being satisfied
with conditions there he moved back
to the old homestead. Here his first
companion thru life passed away,
November 4, 1891. In 1894 he was
again united in marriage, this time
to Miss Nellie Mallory, of Lisbon,
Illinois, who died the following year.
In 1903 the many opportunities
that the Red River valley offered in
duced him to move to this city with
his son Maurice and wife and his
only daughter, Ethel. During the 13
years that he resided in this vicinity
L. 0. Munger has done much to
spread the gospel of better farming.
As a grain grower and stock raiser
he has aided his fellow tillers of the
soil greatly by teaching them and
demonstrating the better way of
farming. There were few men in
this part of the valley who have
learned by experience as much of
agriculture and stock breeding as did
Mr. Munger. Whatever he learned
he was willing to impart for the
benefit of mankind.
He was a kind and loving father,
a man of sterling worth and was held
high in the esteem of his neighbors
and. friendsV Mp, Munger was? an ex

r. in his
journey thru life.
The funeral was held at the M. E.
church in this city on Monday after
noon at three oclock and was large
ly attended by friends and neighbors,
who came to pay their last respects
and love to the departed old farmer,
who has finished his good work on
earth. TKe funeral was conducted
under the auspices of the Warren
Masonic Lodge, of which deceased
has long been a member. He was
also a member of the M. E. church
here. An impressive sermon was
preached by Rev. L. W. Bartholow.
The floral tributes were many and
beautiful. The remains were snipped
for burial to Lisbon, Illinois and
were accompanied by daughter, Miss
Ethel Munger and Mr. C. Enix.

munity extends a most heartfelt sym

An ideal day favoring the incident,
the first picnic of the different Vasa
Orders of the Red River valley re
sulted in one of the biggest "turn
outs" of old settlers ever wittnessed
in Marshall county. At the appoint
ed hour, Sunday forenoon, headed by
the Warren City Band, members of
the Vasa Order and their friends,
left from the Odd fellows Hall for
the Indian Trail Sandridge, where
they were joined by representative
citizens from Crookston, Thief River
Falls and Alvarado. An address of
welcome was extended by L. M. 01-
'son in well chosen words on behalf of
the Warren Lodge, responded to by
representatives of the other lodges.
The band rendered several selections
fitting to the occasion. Games of
sport, peculiarly adopted to the tastes
of the Scandinavian people were in
dulged in. By a suggestion from the
Thief River Falls lodge, next in mem
bership to Warren, a Vasa picnic will
hereafter He an annual event.
At about five o'clock the crowd dis
banded, all satisfied that it had been
one of the most enjoyable,daysoever
spent.

All Nations 5 Warren 2
In a rather loosely played game on
the part of the local nine, the fa
mous traveling organization known
as the All Nations ball club added
another victory to their scalp- belt
Saturday. The Waren club could not
come up to their usual standard and
made several costly errors that gave
the visitors the game with a score
of 5 to 2.

Before one of the largest crowds
ever gathered for a baseball game at
the D,aeotah Park at Grand Forks,
Sunday ^afternoon, Warren again suf
fered defeat at the hands of the All

th!^ #pnderful throwing of John Don

Though Warern was defeated, they
gave their opponents a merry chase
and time and again the Warren men
were applauded for brilliant playing.
Warren 5 All Nations 0
After suffering defeat two times
in succession at the hands of the All
Nations bunch, Warren came back in
the third game of the series Monday
evening, and shut out the .famous
wandering club by a score of 5 to
0. Each Warren mail was in good
conation and played first class ball
thru^ut the entire eight inings..
Th(Brain which fell during the af

Foster twirled for Waren and was
in splendid shape,, securing 13 strike
outs from the visitors. Wingfield was
back in his old position behind the
bat and caught an excellent game.

home bag several times no score was
chalked up until the fifth frame,

Warren was in to win as they had

ALVARADO FARMER BUYS
CARLOAD OF MACHINERY
Walter Sands, one of Alvarado's
leading agriculturists was in the city
Friday, for the purpose of restocking
his" large farm with new and modern
farm machinery. He found that his
wants could easily be satisfied here
and ompleted negotiations with the
Warren Machine and Iron Works
company, by which he became the
ownerhofmost
park, Friday evening. Since Mr.
Dahlof has taken charge of the band,
the organization has made a wonder
ful improvement and the musical
numbers rendered at this concert
were exceptionally good. A large
audience was present and showed
their appreciation by repeated ap
plauses.
If it is the intention of the boys
to give regular concerts in the fu
ture, the Sheaf would suggest that a
public subscription to taken up for
the purpose of screening in the band
stand and thus make it impossible
for those "pesky skeeters" to in
ball terrupt them when they are playing
sweet strains of music.
Attempts Suicide.
Luella Stanley^ a transient woman,
attempted to end her life via the
poison route Saturday afternoon in
her room at the Scandia hotel on the
east side. According to the loose
facts that the reporter was able to
gather the woman had been employed
at Argyle, where she had lived a life
of questionable nature and was com
pelled to leave town. After spending
the day here she became despondent
over her troubles and decided to end
her life by taking poison. Shortly
after taking it she was overcome by
its effects and began struggling for
life and was heard by one of the
hotel chamber maids who went into
the room and discovered the uncon
scious woman gasping for breath. An
ambulanc was called and she was
taken to the local hospital and^is
soon completely revived.
