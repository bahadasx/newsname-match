investigation was made this afternoon.

up through a trap door under a bed.
Guns In the House.
Suit cases filled with guns and am

ly vacant house when the arrests were
made. No money of any consequence
wns found. The officials of the St.

Half a dozen St. Marys people, in

down the main street to the Ford car
and started back east.

of the robbers was referred to by the
others as "Bill.". Various other in

been dodging local officers since an
escapade last spring when he fought
with a man, killed his dog and drove
his horse and wagon into Soldier
creek where the horse drowned.
Kstes an Ex-Convict.
Estes is an ex-convict and has long
been looked upon as an exceptionally
bad man by local officers. Hazel
Estes, his sister, who he says drove the
car for the four men the night of
the robbery, was mixed up with Wm.
Butler and others in the "blowing" of
the Fritton safe in Topeka last spring.
She testified in the case but refused
to say anything that would injure
Butler. She admitted she was Butler's
sweetheart and that she was with him
the night of the robbery of the Frit
ton safe.
For a long time she took lunches to

SENATOR PRICE FOR REGISTRAR
Emporia Banker Given Support
in New Position.
Activities of members of the To
peka Commercial club this morning
in their fight to locate a big land loan
bank in Topeka, brought to light that
a number of Democrat politicians In
Kansas are endeavoring to obtain an
appointment for Senator W. M. Price
of Emporia as registrar for this state
or district. It is not known whether
each state shall have a registrar or
one registrar will be appointed for
each district and field deputies ap
pointed for various states upon the
recommendation of Democrat con
gressmen and senators.
J. Will Keliey, secretary of the
Commercial club .telephoned to James
W. Orr at Atchison this morning and
requested the Atchison man to enter
into the fight for Topeka. Mr. Orr
expressed a willingness to do his ut
most for Topeka and at the same time
announced that a determined effort
is being made to get the registrar's
job for the Emporia politician and
banker. S. E. Cobb, chairman of the
committee of the Commercial club to
present statistics to the federal board,
also learned during the morning that
wire pulling is in progress for Sena

Congressman Guy T. Helvering was

Charles E. Lobdell, president of the
First National bank at Great Bend
and a candidate for appointment on
the farm loan board, will be in To

connected with the laying of the cor

brary. At that time Mr. Cobb and
members of his committee, who will
be appointed during the week, will
consult with Mr. Lobdell.
Can Point the Way.
The Great Bend man has been in
Washington in the interests of his
appointment and undrstands the new
bill from A to Z. Important informa
tion is expected from him relative to
the nature of the data that should be
prepared for the consumption of the
federal board when the time arrives
for selection of a location for the bank.
Already Mr. Cobb is compiling in
formation from farm mortgage com
panies, the state tax commission, the
secretary of the state board of agri
culture and Insurance companies re
garding the logical location of Topeka
as a center, for a bank of this nature.
Mr. Cobb estimates roughly that the
farm mortgages listed in Kansas will
asgregate from $70,000,000 to $80,
000,000. "A more logical location could not
be found," said Mr. Cobb. "Topeka
is in the center of a country tnat Is
full of young men anxious to get onto
farms and young men of good char
acter, good risks for loans. The Kan
sas farms will prosper more if they
become smaller, say an average of
eighty acres for every man. Ultimate
ly farms of that size will be found
throughout Kansas and the placing of
the federal bank in a town accessible
to the farmers will hasten this end."

-Land
Excitement among Topeka oil men
and business men at the Commercial
club over Shawnee county's prospec
tive oil wells became more Intense
this week when the news leaked out
that Fred W. Worthington, a wealthy
Ohio oil man, had slipped into the
county and picked up 8,000 acres of
Shawnee county leases. Mr. Worth
ington's leases adjoin the 10,000
acres of J. W- Renker and eastern
interests and 4,000 acres owned jointly
by L. G. Treleaven, John F. Switzer,
Guy Kiene, Valencia, and W. A. Neis
wanger, a Topeka real estate dealer.
This makes approximately 22,000
acres of oil leases in the southwestern
part of the county. So far as is
known those !nterested In the leases
are not attempting to 'sell any stock
and the investments are made in good
faith, based upon their belief, backed
by geologists, that oil exists in Shaw
nee county. The drilling in charge
of Mr. Renker on the Flicklnger farm
is under way and a well has been
sunk 400 feet already. Mr. Renker is
now in New York city consulting with
partners in the oil leases .owned In
Kansas.
Big Interests.
Another Important oil deal which
has come to liht, strengthens the
belief that there is oil in Shawnee
county. The 4,000 acres leased by
Treleaven, Swifter, Kiene and Neis
wanger adjoin the Renker leases.
When Renker sank his well on the
Flickinger farm he selected a spot only
half a mile from the holdings of the
Topeka people.
Instantly they busied themselves
and recently a deal has been effected
by which Renker acquires a share in
the leases and will be the operating
head. Should oil be found in the well
now being sunk, or if the signs that,
oil is near are favorable, the next well
will go down on the holdings of Tre
leaven, Switzer, Kiene and Neis
wanger. Work on Stone Leases.
Then twenty-five miles to the west
of these holdings the old leases ob
tained by Robert Stune and others are
being worked by oil men. The an
nouncement was made a week ago
that a local company had been grant
ed a charter with $100,000 capital for
sinking wells in Shawnee county. The
personnel of the company includes
George E. Clark, H. G. West, E. C.
Arnold, C. S. Ellrott and H. W. Seery.
The company holds 11,000 acres of
leases north of Slver Lake.
Drilling will be resumed at Over

Auditorium, St. Paul, Minn., July 19.
The Prohibition national convention
got down to real politics at its opening
session today. The fight between J.
Frank Hanly of Indiana and William
Sulzer of New York for the party's
presidential nomination developed
some old style wire pulling and rough
and tumble negotiations.
Sulzer was speeding to St. Paul, it
was stated, hoping to arrive here in
time to prevent Hanly adherents from
nominating their candidate one day
ahead of the scheduled time for nomi
nations. Sulzer men caucused prior
to opening the convention today and.
after counting noses, said there were
enough supporters of the New Yorker
to give Hanly a hot fight. If Hanly
is nominated, Virgil C. Hmshaw will
remain as chairman of the national
committee.
Religion Mixes In.
Religious bitterness was mixed into
the convention again today. The
American Federation of Patriotic So
cieties, an anti-Catholic organization,
which is supporting Sulzer, has many
representatives on .the ground. Pro
hibition, woman suffrage and govern
ment ownership of munitions plants
were advocated today in Daniel E.
Poling's keynote speech opening the
convention.
''Greenbackers, Populists and Bull
Moose may perish from the earth but
we go on forever," Chairman Hinshaw
aid in opening the convention. "Our
cause is at its high tide. Our slogan
once was 'A saloonless nation by
1920;' now it is 'A saloonless nation
in 19 J C' "
Two Kansans Honored.
The convention staged a five-minute
demonstration for former Gov.
John P. St. John, of Kansas. St. John
made a brief speech against the plan
to change the party's name.
Poling, the temporary chairman,
seemed the youngest man in the con
vention. The delegates cheered him
roundly.
Robert Patton, Springfield, 111., was
today selected permanent chairman,
with Howard Kershner, Topeka, Kan.,
permanent secretary of the Prohibi
tion convention.
Resolutions asking that the Susan
I B. Anthony amendment be made a
party issue of the Prohibitionists were
passed by the Woman's National fed
eration today. The federation said
booze is responsible for Europe's war.

of the Union Pacific system, and
Frank Trumbull, chairman of the
railroad exeeutivetrtf some provisions
of the Clayton anti-trust act post

The railroad officials told the presi
dent they considered sections of the

make contracts for construction and
maintenance amounting to more than
$50,000 a year with corporations hav
ing officials or employes connected
with the common carrier, unless the
transactions are carried on by com
petitive bidding under rules prescribed
by the interstate commerce commis
sion. The other relates to the con
trol of corporations engaged in com
mercial purpose of lessening compe
tition. '
The president was requested to co
operate in asking congress to postpone
the operation for the former section
for two years until the joint commit
tee of congress created for the pur
pose of investigating the entire rail
road problem has an opportunity to

RESCUE FOUR MINERS
Imprisoned '41 Hours, Reached
liggers Early Today.
by
Joplin, Mo., July 19. Four men
who have been imprisoned in the Bab
cock mine near here since 2 o'clock
Monday afternoon were rescued alive
at 7:15 o'clock this morning.
The men did not appear exhausted
by their vigil of forty-one hours, with
out light, food or water, and were
able to walk to their homes. The res
cue party first talked with the men
through the barrier of dirt that sep
arated them from the shaft at 4
o clock this morning. Unon heine
told that they would be reached with-
in a few hours and that physicians
and ambulances were kept in waiting
the prisoners declared they intended
to walk home and asked that the phy
sicians be sent away.
Rescuers More Weary Than Rescued.
A large crowd, brought together by
the news that the men were alive and
would be rescued soon, i was awaiting
at the shaft's mouth when the men
came up one at a time. Cheer after
cheer rang out as they stepped from
the mine car that had brought them
to the sunlisht again.
The release of the imprisoned min
ers followed ar. exciting battle with
tons of dirt and rock by rescue crews
which worked in short relays. Some
of the rescuers had remained contin
uously in the shaft since the cave-in
and appeared more tired today than
did those for whose safety they had
worked so hard.
"We did not suffer much except for
lack of water," Howard Gideon, one of
the four, said. "We had no Idea as
to the time, as we could not see our
watches. But what worried us most
was the fact that the wife of one of
the men was ill when he left home
Monday."
JTever Knter Mine Again.
The other three miners are Morgan
Wood, W. E. Bowers and Barron Gid
eon. The Gideon brothers came here
from Springfield, Mo a few weeks
ago.
"We are going back to Springfield
right away," one of them announced.
"And you'll never see us in another
mine."

Petrograd, July 19. For the first
time since the Russian retreat from
the Carpathians more than a year
ago, Russian forces are again ham
mering at the Carpathian mountain
passes, barring the way into Hungary.
On a sixty mile front, extending
from the Jablonitza Pass in a south
easterly direction to Kirlababa, Rus
sian and Austrian detachments are
in constant clash. The main Russian
line is rapidly drawing near the moun
tain barrier.
After vain efforts to bring up artil

London, July 19. The Germans

Several German regiments struck

north of the Somme last night in a

RAIN FALLS TODAY
Temperature Took Tumble to 73 This
' Afternoon.
The extreme hot period which has
made Kansas swelter beneath cloud
less skies by day and warm, sultry
nights was badly fractured today, S.
D. Flora, forecaster, said.
The temperature took a sudden
tumble this afternoon shortly before 2
o'clock and at that time It tell to 73,
cooler than the lowest temperature
last night. The cause of the fall was
a cool and welcome Vain which fell
on all parts of the city. At 2 o'clock
the precipitation measured .3 of an
inch. The air was extremely cool
and the mercury still falling slightly.
S. D. Flora, forecaster, said there
was a condition in the weather this
morning that might make this after
noon's rain something more than a
local shower. Local showers are grow
ing more frequent over the state.
Cooler weather prevails in the most of
Kansas. There is a possibility of more
showers tonight.
There was a fifteen mile wind this
afternoon.
Topeka slept the term can be used
by courtesy only through another
hot night. The lowest temperature
was 74 at 5 o'clock this morning.
Shortly after that hour the mercury
started on a steady climb which land
ed at 86 degrees at 9:30 o'clock.
That spurt proved a false alarm.
The temperature did not go above 86
and tomorrow will not be warmer.
The eky was cloudy all morning and
at 8:30 o'clock a twelve-mile wind was
blowing from the northeast, after
changing from the south at 5 o'clock.
At 10 o'clock the wind was blowing
eight miles an hour. These conditions,
combined with the fact that the
weather promises to be threatening
this afternon and tonight, will make
the night a fine one for sleep, Mr.
Flora says. However, the forecaster
promises no relief from the drouth.
There may be a few scattered showers
over the state, but they will not be
measurable, it is thought.
This date in 1887 was a memorable
one in weather history in this state.
The lowest temperature and highest
for the date was recorded then. In
the morning it was 58 degrees and
raced to 103 in the afternoon.
The weather forecast is partly
cloudy and cooler. Thursday fair, with
no ram of consequence.
Scattered showers, some of which
were moderately heavy, have fallen in
western and northern Kansas in the
last 24 hours. Temperatures of 100
degrees and higher yesterday are re
ported from the greater part of the
state, while a few stations- reported
lower temperatures than 70 degrees
last night.

FEWER CASES OF
PARALYSIS THIS
YEAR THAN LAST
No Reason for Infantile Scar
Now, Is Discovery.
Reports for This Summer Are
Below the Average.
10 TO 30 YEARLY SINCE 1910
But Never Before Has an Epi
demic Been Feared.
Situation in East Is Cause of
New Concern.
Infantile paralysis Is u matter of
less concern this year than during
any season In seven years, so far aa
Kansas is concerned. That was the
statement today of Dr. S. J. Crum
blne, secretary of the state board of
health. The statement was based on
official reports of the last seven years.
Seven cases this month and nine
cases since June 1 is the state's record
for the year. Reports of the last two
weeks have been slightly above nor
mal for this season or the year, but
returns for the summer are below the
average. In June several weeks be
fore the big scare in New York two
cases of Infantile paralysis were re
ported in Kansas. The matter nrrii.
sioned such slight concern that no
special mention was made of the dis
ease in the June reports.
Since 1910,, the state has averaged
from ten to thirty cases of Infantile
paralysis a year. During none of these
yeare has the disease assumed the pro
portions of an epidemic. All cases
were in widely separated communi
ties and no trace was shown of distri
bution of the disease through contact.
Conditions In the state since 1910 have
been similar to those now facing the
state board of health. Because there
was no general alarm concerning the
spread of the disease, the situation oc-,
casioned only passing concern in Kan-
Kpidemic In 1909-10.
In 1909 and 1910, conditions in Kan
sas were similar to epidemic form.
Doctor Crumbine stated. During those
years several cases were reported from
local communities and there was evi
dence of a spread of the disease
through contact. No such conditions
exist in the state at this time.
"Records since 1910 have shown an
average of from ten to thirty cases a
year in widely separated communi
ties," said Doctor Crumbine. "Condi
tion this year are no worse than in
former seasons, only a more general
concern is felt because of the situation
facing large cities in other states. Of
course if the record of the last two
weeks should continue during the
summer, the record for the year would
probably be above normal. But there
is nothing to Indicate that such a con
dition will be presented."
In event the state should face an
epidemic, it might be necessary to rely
on private contributions to fight the
disease. There is a very limited sup
ply of money available for use by the
state board. Recent legislatures have
given far more attention to the health
of cattle, hogs and horses than to the
health of Kansas babies.
Cut Off the 1'und.
During the 1918 legislature, -a Dem
ocrat ways and means committee cut
off the state board's contingent fund
of 16,000 a year. The Rfmihllinn
' legislature of 1915 showed an equal
in uettiLfi conaitions.
Although Dr. Crumbine pleaded with
the ways and means committee for
the restoration of his contingent fund,
the law makers were pledged to strict
economy and refused to provide the
money. The same legislature also
held up an emergency appropriation
for the state tuberculosis sanitarium
and for nearly two months delayed
the opening of the state institution.
The same law makers, almost with
out consideration or debate, voted
$60,000 for immediate use in fighting
the foot and mouth disease among
cattle and provided that thw state
might issue bonds in an additional
amount of $260,000 an even quarter
of a million for stamping out the
disease. The ways and means com
mittee laughed when Ir. Crumbmo
suggested a fund for fighting a pos
sible epidemic such as infantile pa
ralysis or other dread diseases.. "
