ORPET FOUND NOT GUILTY OF
KILLING MARION LAMBERT,
Jury in Waukegan, ill., Brings in Verdict After Five
flours Clearing University Student of
Causing Death of Sweetheart.
Waukegan, Ill., July 15th.
William H. Orpet, the univer
sity student charged with murder.
nlug Marion Lambert, a high
school girl and his ewedtheart,
was found not guilty tonight by
a jury in Judge Donnellyss court
after five hours' deliberation.
Three ballots were teken. The
first two stood eleven to one for
acquittal.
Orpet, brought from his cell to
hear `the verdict, was silent
through excess of emotion. He
was barely able to return the
handclasps of his lawyers. He
made his way to the jurors and
shook their hands one by one,
smiling wanly but saying nothing.
Orpet's mother received the
verdict as a matter of fact.
Thanked Sheriff Gaiffith for
making his four months' stay in
jail as comfortable as possible.
The party was driven home.
The selection of the jury began
on May 15, the taking of the
testimony was begun on June 15,
and acquittal came on July 15.
There appeared in evidence
forty-four letters written by Or
pet to Marion over a period of a
year; bottles and boxes con
taining samples of cyanide from
the McCormock estate, from the
Deerfield High School laboratory,
from Kraft's drug store at Lake
Forest and white powder scraped
from Marion's hand and from
spots on her cloak; the girls gar
ments; a magazine article deal.
ing with the use of cyanide as a
fumigator in greenhouses; the
chemistry text book used respec.
tively by the high school girls
and the college students, a copy
of the Wisconsin statute dealing
with. the sail of poisons, and a
bottle of molases and water.
Orpet explained on the stand
that the alibi letters, as they
came to be known, were written
9Q that if by accident he were
seen at Lake Forest and word of
the fact reached Marion's parents
who objected to him, or his own
parents, who expected him to
remain faithful to college duties
at Madison, they would accept
the letters as conclusive evidence
to the contrary. The letter to
Josephine was to corroborate
that to Marion. Josephine testified
that she never received it.
ORPET LEADS HER TO LONE
SPOT
On the afternoon of Feb. 8, in a
dark overcoat, which he said he
had borrowedito wear with a dress
suit to a party which he expected
to attend on Feb. 12, carrying
the bottle of molasses and water
in his pocket, and leaving behind
him the alibi letters and a bed
rumpled to deceive his landlady
the student proceeded by way of
Millwaukee, where he passed a
half hour or so between trains,
to Lake Forest. Arriving there he
arranged by telephone tc meet
Marion on her way to school the
next morning, walked about for a
while to make certain that his par
ents had gone to bed and entered
the McCormack garage, where
he passed the night on a cot.
In the morning he and Marion
net and walked through the snow
into the woods. Orpet testified
;hat there was little conversatson,
mnd that he could recollect only
)urport of it. He offered her the
'medicine" and she refused it.
Elie started to leave, but she called
rim back and asked him if he was
going to write to her any more.
le said there seemed to be no
ise of it, and started away again.
"Something made me look
Lround- I dont know what-- and
L saw Marion lying on the snow",
1e related on the stand. "I return
id, kneeled [over her for maybe
a minute. I noticed the moist
powder in the lines of her hand.
Eler eyes were glazed. Then a
kind of fog eame on my brain,
and I don't remember much after
that except that on reaching the
road I threw away the "medicine"
and made my way on foot to
Hignland Park, caught a train
and that evening arrived back at
Madison."
