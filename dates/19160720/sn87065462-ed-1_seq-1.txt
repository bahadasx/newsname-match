Negotiable Paper Act
Law in Effect Relating
Commercial Papers -
to
Mississippi's new negotiable
nstruments act went into effect
uly 6, and is now a part and
parcel of the laws of the com
monwealth
The new chapter on negotiable
nstruments is one of the long-
st enacted at the recent legisla
pve session, makes some radica
fjhanges in the old law applicable
llo commercial paper,
r Frr inctanr hrp'. Knmrlino
hat will be sad news to the
fellows who are not prompt in
pieeting their notes on the date
pvhen due:
Suppose you owe Bill Smith
J100 and have given your note in
ayment for same, payable to-
orrow morning.
It bill knows you have money
m deposit in the bank he s not
oing to worry about whether
ou are going to pay that $100
lote. Not a bit of it. Bill wi
imply take that note to the bank
knd have it cashed, just like it
i
as a check. The bank is com
felled to pay it out of the funds
jrVou have on deposit, providing
ey are sufficient to cancel the
principal and interest.
Another effect of the new law
ill be to require banking in
titutions to close at noon hour
n Saturday.
The negotiable instruments
ct was framed by State Senator
Jurray, of Warren county." Its
fjurpose is to make the Mississip
pi laws relative to all forms of
Commercial paper con form to the
uniform negotiable instruments
statutes of other states. All
states in the union, with but
..... ...
wo or three exceptions, have
enacted this law.
Here are some of the provis-
jns of the new law that shouid
je carefully studied by all busi
es men:
"Every negotiable instrument
13 payaoie ai me time nxea
tl i j1 'a' c J
herein' without grace. When
he day of maturity falls on Sun-
iay or a holiday, the instrument
s payable on the next succeed
ng business day. Instruments
falling due or becoming payable
i a i. i
n Saturday are 10 De presented
'or payment on the next succeed
ng business day, except that in
struments payable on demand
ay at the option of the holder,
presented before 12 o'clock
on on Saturday when that en-
re day is not a holiday,
"An instrument is payable on
.'emand where it is expressed to
. 1 I J 1 A
( navaoie on ueinanu, or ai
I ght, or on presentation, or m
I'hich no time for payment is ex
pressed." I Notes do not bear three days
If grace. Sight and demand
drafts may not be accepted as
firmerly; they will bear only
lch grace as they specify for
Ymple, "One day after sight,"
I'At three days sight. " When
Jraft payable after sight or a
ihe falls due on Sunday or a
holiday it is payable on the next
;u,ftess day following; and when
S'A.e on Saturday the payer has
A option of deferring payment
Jtil Monday (or, if Monday is a
!oliday until the next business
Ky following), but this option
f, regard to paper maturing on
Saturday does not apply to de
mand drafts presneted before
l o'clock that day. .
The drawee is allowed twen-
Ly.four hours after presentment
Li which to decide whether or
Lit he will
accept the bill (of,
but the acceptance
xchange),
giyen dates as of tne day
of
i
resentation.
This applies to drafts payable
after sight, not to drafts payable
on demand. If the draft is pre
sented on the 8th of the month,
say, the person on whom it is
drawn may wait until the 9th to
decide whether he will accept it,
but if he accepts it after this
delay his acceptance must be
dated as the 8th.
Where the instrument is
made payable ' at a bank it is
equivalent to an order to the
bank to pay the same for the
account of the principal debtor
thereon."
That is, if a person signs a
note in favor of another person
(or firm or organization) and
makes it payable at the bank
where he keeps his account, the
holder o the note may present
it at the bank named on due
date and if the person who sign
ed the note has sufficient funds
and has not given a stop pay
ment order the Dank must pay
the note and charge it to his (the
signer's account), and it is not
required to obtain his consent
before doing sq.
"Where the instrument con
tains or the person adds to his
signature words indicating that
he signs for or on behalf of a
principal, or in a representative
capacity, he is not liable on the
instrument if he was duly
authorized, but the more addi
tions of words describing him as
agent, or as filling a representa
tive character, without disclosing
his principal, does not exempt
him from personaMlability." .-
A bona fide agent or represen
tative is not personally liable on
an instrument he signs, but if a
person signs as agent in an at
tempt to evade personal liability
and can not prove that he signed
for' a principal under due
authority, he is personally liable.
'Where an instrument con
taining the words 'I promise to
pay' is signed by two or more
persons, they are aeemea to De
jointly and severally liable there
on."
An accommodation party is
one who has signed the instru
ment as maker, drawer, acceptor
or endorser, without receiving
value therefor, and for the pur
pose of lending his name to some
other person. Such a person is
liable on the instrument to s
holder for value, notwithstand
ing such holder at the time of
taking the instrument knew him
to be only an accommodation
party."
"Where there is a conflict be
tween the written and printed
provisions of the instrument the
written provision prevail."
"Where the sum payable is ex
pressed in words and also in
figures and there is a discrepancy
between the two the sum denoted
by the words is the sum payable,
but if the words are ambiguous
or uncertain reference may be
had to the figures to fix the
amount." Yazoo Sentinel.

Some Little Bug.
' On April 22nd, Mr. Monroe, a
member of Congress from Penn
sylvania, in making a speech
supporting a resolution for an
appropriation for investigation
of insects affecting field crops
etc., used as an argument the
following verses attributed to
Mr. Roy Atwell, a comedian
who surely has given deep
thought to the subject of bugs
In these days of indigestion,
It is an oftime question
As to what to eat and what
leave alone,
For .each microbe and bacillus
Has a different way to kill us,
to
And in time they always claim
us for their own.
There are germs of every kind
In and food that you can find,
In the market or the bill of
fare
Drinking water is just as risky,
As the so-called deadly whiskey
And its often a mistake to
breathe the air.
Some little bug is going to find
you some day,
Some little bug will creep be
hind you some day,
Then he'll send for his bug
friends
And all your earthly troubles
end
Some little bug is going to find
you some day.
The inviting green cucumber,
Gets 'most everydody's number,
While the green corn has
system of its own,
Though a radish seems nutri
tious,
Its behaviour is quite vicous,
And the doctor will be coming
to your home.
Eating lobster cooked or plaiu,
Is only fighting with ptomaine,
While an oyster sometimes
has a lot to say,
But the clams we eat in chow
der
Make the angels chant the
louder,
For they know that we'll be
with them right away.
Take a slice of nice fried onion
And you're fit for Dr. Munion;
Apple dumpling kill you quick
er than a train.
Chew a cheesy midnight "rab
bit" And a grave you'll soon inhabit
Ah, to eat at all is such a fool
ish game.
Eating huckelberry pie
Is a pleasing way to die,
While sauerkraut brings
softening of the brain.
When you eat banana fritters
on
The undertaker titters
And the casket makers nearly
go insane.
Some little bug is going to find
you some day,
Some little bug will creep behind
you some day,
With a nervous little quiver,
He'll give cirrhosis of the
liver,
Some little bug is going to find
you some day.
When cold storage vaults I visit,
I can only say why is it,
Poor mortals fill their systems
with such stuff?
Now for breakfast prunes are
dandy
If a stomach pump is handy,
And your doctor can be found
. quite soon enough!
Eat a plate of fine pig's knuckles
And the headstone cutter
chuckles.
While the grave digger makes
a note upon his cuff,
at that lowly red bologna,
And you'll wear a wooden
kimono,
As your relatives start scrap
. pin' about your stuff.
Some little bug is going to find
you some day,
Some little bug will creep behind
you some day,
Eating jucy sliced pineapple,
Make3 the sexton dust the
chapel,
Some little bug is going to find
you some day.
Luscisus grapes breed 'pendic
itis, And the juice leads to gastritis,
To there's only death to greet
us either way,
And fried liver's nice, but mind
you,
Friends will soon ride slow be

And the papers then will have
nice things to say.
Some little bug is going to find
you some day,
Some little bug will creep be
hind you some day,
Eat some sauce they call H

On your breast they'll place s
a lily,

Infantile Paralysis in Miss.
Dr. Walley, has sent out the
following letter to all county
health officers
July 15, 1916.
My Dear Doctor :-
Infantile paralysis has been
reported in a number of counties,
in a fewxounties, several cases,
and this is to call your attention
to the fact that in each instance,
rigid quarantine should be car
ried out in the home where a
case of this disease appears.
Inasmuch as we are not at
present positive how this disease
is transmitted, and since we
cannot give specific instructions
to prevent the spread of the
same, it is important that every
sanitary precaution he used, in
order that we may be able to
protect the health of the people
rom the spread of this malady.
It is claimed by some investi
gators that the disease is spread
by the stable fly, others claim it is
spread by the common housefly,
and some few, that the disease
contagious, gaining entrance
through the nose and mouth.
The work of sanitation is most
important, including strict isola
tion, protection of the patient
from flies and other insects, by
thoroughly screening the room,
the use of mosquito nets or both.
Strict care in the handling and
preparation of foods for not only
the patient but those exposed to
the disease, the utmost care be
ing used in preventing gather
ings, such as attending parties,
picnics, schools, and Sunday
school, church or any congrega-
tion of people that might cause
the spread of the disease.
Of course, you understand
that it is practically impossible
to establish a county or town
quarantine, but each house
should be placarded or put up a
flag so that the public would un
derstand that this disease was
in the home.
We are mailing this letter to
each County Health Officer in
the state. Of course you under
stand if you have no paralysis in
your county, that this letter will
put you on your guard, and if
there are any cases in your
county, now, or should any de
velop in the future, we would
like to ask that you report to
this office daily, such cases.
This is important, in as much as
we are anxious to keep up . with
the situation.
With best wishes, I am.
Cordially yours,
Willis Walley, M. D.,
Assistant Secretary.
How to Guard Your Child
ren Against Infantile
Paralysis
By Dr. Leonard Keene Hirsh
berg, A. B., M. A., M. D.,
(John-Hopkins University)
The unhappy epidemic of in
fantile paralysis of 1907 resulted
in important 'investigations by
Prof. Flexner and his colleague
Dr. Noguchi of the Rockefeller
Institute, and these, in turn,
brought about the discovery by
them of an exceedingly small
germ which causes the paralysis.
This dread scourge of children
is due to disease spots in the
fore-part of the spinal cord.
The germ grows out of contact
with oxygen, and can be detect
ed only by the ultra-microscope.
The germ has been isolated from
other germs, and Dr. Noguchi
has succeeded in growing it, so
that in large colonies it can be
seen and studied.
Dr. Flexner obtained pure cul
tures of the germ from the nasal
discharge of children who had
the disease and with these has
reproduced it in monkeys.
The next step to be taken will
be to find a serum or vaccine
which will immunize those who
may be exposed to the disease or
those who have come down with
it. The germ, present in the
fluids of the nose, is carried by
certain individuals, especially
adults, who are immunized, like
carriers of typhoid or diphtheria,
and distribute the distemper to
those who are not immune, es
pecially children under ten years
of age.
Is Easily "Caught"
The transference takes place
by the hands, by handkerchiefs
or otherwise to the nasal mucous
membrane ot those who are
sensitive. It gets into the lymph
or blood and is finally localized
or deposited in the "cells" of
the anterior portion of the gray
matter of the spinal cord. There
it develops and produces the
disease of which the chief symp
toms are paralysis of the muscles
of the extremities. One arm and
one leg, both arms and both legs,
or only one muscle or group of
muscles may be involved.
Beginning suddenly with fev
er, restlessness, sometimes vom
iting or convulsions, more or less
delirum and other vague symp
toms, no diagnosis is possible
until a day or so have elapsed
Even other parts may be affect
ed, and in the worst instance the
child may die in a few days.
Sometimes, the ownset is even
more sudden, and a child, well
on going to bed, is found paraly
zed in the morning. Considera
ble improvement often takes
place, though slowly. Diminu
tion of strength and restricted
use of the limbs may remain
through, life.
The epidemic which is now
prevalent in New York and the
vicinity is much more severe and
is attended with heavier mortal
ity than the epidemic of 1907.
The latter, however, was partic
ularly memorable because it was
followed by investigations which
led to the discovery of the mi
crobe.
Isolation Best Prevention
The disease is extremely infec
tious and contagious, particularly
in the homes of the careless and
stovenly. For this reason the
victim should be quarantined for
at least six weeks.
This is also the reason why it
is best that children should not
gather in crowds, street cars,
playgrounds, libraries, resorts,
churches or schools, for there
may be carriers there who may
have the disease without the
symptoms as yet.
When a child is attacked, iso
lation is the first means by which
to protect others.
There may be no pain at all,
or it may be mild or severe.
However, when pain is present
jt may be eased with sedatives,
with heat or perhaps with gentle
massage. The two most import
ant factors in treatment are
simple food, especially hot or
cold milk, and rest, complete
rest.
The patient must be kept ab
solutely quiet, if possible, to
give the spinal marrow a chance
to recuperate. While some in
stances are mild and give com
paratively little trouble, some
are severe and result in more or
less extensive paralysis. Some
of the ' paralyzed muscles often
regain their vitality and some
may remain permanently help
less. Infantile paralysis is a disease
of warm weather. Its dangers
will not be passed until cold
weather, consequently parents
must be very watchful all sum
mer. At the first signs of fever or
crossness, summon a doctor.
Do not be like your aunts and
grandmorthers and blame any-
thing on "teething" or
wvima.
