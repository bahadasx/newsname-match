Another Cutting Scrape
We are cutting the prices of groceries, until every man, woman
and child can eat We buy our goods cheap and we can afford to
sell cheap. We buy bargains and then give them to our customers,
and that is the reason we have such a big trade. We buy all kinds
of produce and pay you in Uncle Sams due bills and that kind of
due bills will buy any thing any whee to eat, drink or wear, and
people who are not to predjudiced to trade where their money would
get the most goods are beginning to see what it mean to trade at our
store. Bring us your chickens when you bring your butter and eggs
for we want them and pay the market all the time.
Bring us your butter and eggs. We pay more.

Leave The Cards.
People who have boxes at the
yuaiuiubc trrj iwir toe miui
which notify them that a pack
age has been received which is
too large for the box. This is
all wrong. First, they forget to
bring the cards back, and if the
card is muplaced they are apt to
forget that they have a package
at the postoffice. And. too, many
times the package will remain in
the postoffice, simply because per
haps the owner does not know the
package is there.
If you are not ready to take
the packaae away, leave the
card in the box until you are.
Then give the card in at the
stamp or delivery window and re
ceive your package.
