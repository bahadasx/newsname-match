Weather and Crops
The earth and pvterythlng on lop of
It in this Immediate1 section Is getting
pretty dry The thermometer has been
registering considerably above 100
every day foHiearly two weeks and no
rain nt all this mpnlli
Wheat oats arid most of the hay litis
been harvested sdmc of the whcnt
threshed and milch of it stacked
The wncafVatf a big disappointment
Nobody expected much of u crop but
most of the estimates two months ago
were between 10 and 12 bushels while
the actual yield rung from 3 to 7
bushels Vivian CqfciUjyv a mile and a
half west of Jasper averaged 12 bush
els off of G5 ncresnnQ 7 acres averaged
10 bushels This yield is the prize
winner around Jasper this year but it
would be a mighty poor showing in n
normal year here The grade is also
low and its likely that much Jasper
County wheat will be fed to stock this
year
The oqts that promised so much a
feV weeks ago nic not coining up to
expectations either though the yield
will average very fair
The hay crop is good both wllcLnml
tame
Corn still looks very good but farm
ers are anxiously watching the skies
for rain They say corn can stand
another week with very little loss

Deardoiff Store Changes Hands
Again
It wan related in these columns last
week that the Joe DeardorlT store hud
been sulci to Mr Lawrence of Kansas
City It was true enough but after
Lawrence ran the store a week hud
bought furniture for his home and was
figuring on buying housc the store
was suddenly transferred back to Mr
DeardorlT Mr Lawrence said that
Joe was sick of hlsstrade and persuad
ed him to let him hnvq the store back
He that as it may before Joe had the
store much more than 0 minutes he
had sold it again this time to Oils
Owlngs

him and we expect him to get his
share of the grocery trade of the com
munity

WHEAT A DISAPPOINTMENT
Failure Teaches Need of a Fight
on Hessian Fly
The wheat crop in Jasper county
just harvested is a failure The per
centage of fields that will pay expenses
is small and few will show a profit to
the farmer Anything that will aid
in preventing a repetition of this sit
uation should be tiltemlcd to carefully
and one of the most important con
siderations is the stumping out of the
Hessian ily
Control of the Hessian Ily maybe
accomplished only by special elTort
andean be u success only by the co
operation of entire neighborhoods A
summary of what todo is Plow early
plow deep disk to destroy all volun
teer wheat sow on the lly free tlute
and co operutc
The first step should be taken as
soon as possible The wheat stubble
should be plowed deeply as soon as
possible the earlier the better Plow
under the stubble and get the field
clean Only fields having a good
stand of clover should be left unplow
cd and these only where it is planned
to save the grass
Immediately after plowing disk or
drag the ground and frequently during
the summer repeat this operation
keeping down volunteer wheat or oats
at all costs If this is not done the ily
will come into the field and remain
there until the wheat is sown ready to
devour and destroy the young plants
Volunteer oats will do almost us much
harm as volunteer wheat By keeping
all green growth from the plowed
ground the Ily will be starved and
there will be no late Utters to damage
the corn
No wheat should be seeded in Jas
per county before October 1 1 Anyone
who sows wheat earlier than that date
is not only doing damage to himself
but is furnishing a place for the propa
gation of Hessian flies to harass his
neighbors The same is true of the
person -who plows late and who does
not keep his plowed ground free from
volunteer growth The co operation of
an entire neighborhood will result in
the extermination of the ily in that
locality and thereby will save to the
farmers of the vicinity their portion of
the flOHHO000 loss suffered by Mis
souri farmers in euch of the last two
years
lteasons for failure to exterminate
thellesHian fiy arc lute plowing fail
ure to destroy volunteer wheat and
failure to delay sowing until the fly
free date The time to begin the
campaign against the Hessian Ily is
now and ground plowed by August t
and cultivated to kill volunteer growth

EiRhteenth Year No 47
Dr McNally Vistta Jasper
Dr II B McNally representing the
Bureau of Animal Industry of the
Government Agricultural Department
was in Jasper Tuesday getting in touch
with the farmers of this community
Dr McNally is sent to Jasper County
to enter upon a campaign against hog
cholera
While Dr McNally will live at Car
thage he is here to advise and assist
any and all of Jasper County farmers
and invites them to call upon him
phone him or write him at any time
His office will be In the Business Mens
League rooms at the courthouse
The Doctor has been in the Govern
ment service the past 18 years and has
made extensive investigation and has
had long practice in fighting hog chol
era His investigations and work for
the Government have led him to be
lieve thoroughly in the double system
of vaccination that is the use of both
serum and virus Thcsingle treatment
has about gone out of use because it
has been found that hogs thus treated
frequently do not remain immune
longer than six week
The double treatment makes hogs
immune a lifetime When brood fows
are thus treated their pigs are aho im
mune until weaned and then when they
weigh 85 to 40 pounds they should be
vaccinated
When hogs are given the double
treatment they may be put in with in
fected hogs without any danger of con
tracting the infection under any cir
cumstances
Dr McNally is a very pleasant gen
tleman and we hope Jasper hog men
will meet him at their first opportunity
and cooperate with him in this very
important work
A New Hat
Lou Pitts acquired u new hat
last week in a manner not altogether
original nor always satisfactory Ixiu
was nt the drug -store when Harry
rlhelps nd several other Carthage men
stopped in to wet their whistles at the
soda fountain The party had been
fishing and were as dry ns the fish
weve read about and after absorbing
several limeades ginger ales and grape
fruit specials they continued their way
to Carthage taking Lous perfectly
good Panama along Lou says his hat
was a mid the one left him
by the Carthuge men is coming 2 but
the latter is a thoroughly discouraged
looking hut probably the result of re
peated fishing trips
We Charged the Wrong Mam
