"J. II." RUN TOMORROW
Sociability Run Over the Jefferson
Highway from St. Joe, Mo. to
Winnipeg, British Columbia.
The directors and officers of the
Jefferson Highway Association, desir
ing to get in closer touch with the
people living along this great Nation
al Highway, have planned a sociabil
ity run from St. Joseph, Mo., to St.
Paul, Minn., and on to SVinnipeg, B.
C. The directors of the association
held a two days meeting at St. Joe
^commencing yesterday morning, and
at the close of the meeting at St. Joe,
.the sociability run will leave that city
this afternoon at 2 o'clock, and the
first night control will be at Bethany,
Aio.
This promises to be one of the
moi:t interesting sociability runs ever
undertaken. It is the first run over
the Jefferson Highway and the offici
.aals are expecting to make it a rec
ord breaker, both for interest and
the creating of good roads sentiment.
To that end some very unique plans
have been formed.
The run is to be pulled off in relays
.so that good time can be made and
jet permit of road talks at each town
on the route.
Three or four speakers are to be
provided for each town for a few
minutes talk each. The first speaker
will open the meeting and as soon as
through will leave, with an escort of
two automobiles, for the next town
and open the meeting there. The
second speaker will continue the pro
ceedings for his allotted time and
then leave for the next town with an
escort of two automobiles to do his
turn there. Upon his departure the
third man takes his place and upon
his arrival in the next town, the first
speaker proceeds to the next appoint
ment. At the close of the speaking
in each town, every one taking part
in the run proceeds on the way.
In this Avay, each town can be giv
«n a full program and yet the main
run will be halted only a few min
utes at each place.
The following is the official sched
ule of the departure of the cars from
each town in Decatur county:
Lamopi—First car leaves at 9:49
a. m., second car at 9:59. third car
at 10:09, flag car at 10:14.
Davis City—First car leaves at
10:19, second car at i0:29, third car
at 10:39, flag car at 10:44.
Leon—First car leaves at li:00,
second car at 11:10, third car at
11:20, flag car at li:25.
Van Wert—First car leaves at
11:25, second car at 11:45, third car
at 11:55, flag car at 12:00.
Weldon—First car leaves at 11:47,
second car at 11:57, third car at
12:07, flag car at 12:12.
Follow the Flag.
At each place visited, local cars
are to fall in behind the car carry
ing the large United States flag.
This United States flag is to be
awarded to the town that lines up
the greatest number of cars bearing
pennants with the name of their
town, according to population. Under
this regulation the town of 1000
population stands just as good a
chance to win as a larger town. Cars
carrying the town pennant will be
counted regardless of where they
come from, if they stay in line until
the next town is reached.
No car will be counted that is in
ifront of the flag. Cars will be count
ed that are in line behind the flag
when the flag car is ready to start.
A Tank Car of Oil to be Given as
Premium.
In addition to the flag there will
of road oil to the town having the
largest number of automobiles in
line, as outlined above, provided at
least ten towns compete for the car
load of oil.
This car load of oil was offered
after the above arrangements about
the flag had been made, and hence
there will be a first and second prize.
The town that wins will have the

as provided.

Italph Stewart Won $30 Prize in Ad
vertising Contest.
Ralph Stewart, who has had
charge of the advertising of the F.
S. Stewart Big Furniture Store for
the past few months, last Thursday
received a letter from the Whittall
Rug Co., who recently offered a num
ber of cash prizes to retail dealers
for the best Whittall rug adv. pub
lished in a newspaper, informing him
that out of several thousand contest
ants an advertisement submitted by
him, and which was put in type in the
Leon Reporter office, had been award
ed second place, and they enclosed a
check for the second prife, $30.00.
The check was of course very accept
able to Ralph, but not so much as
the letter from the Whittall Co.,
which warmly congratulated him on
winning second place and compli
mented him very highly on both the
wording and typographical effect of
the adv. This is the second prize
Ralph has won in the Whittall con
tests, having previously won a ?5.00
prize. He is writing some mighty
good advertisements for the Big Fur
niture Store, which are bringing re
sults. He expects to continue adv.
writing and will attend college the
coming year and take a spec1ut course
in advertising and journalism.
Trying to Get the Jefferson Highway
to Hun vltt' Chariton.
W. D. Junkin, editor of the Chari

Mrs. Junkin and Harry Raymond,
secretary of the Chariton Commercial
Ciub, were visitors in Leon last Fri
day, driving down in an auto for the
purpose of inspecting the prospects of
getting the Jefferson Highway direc
tors to change the routing from Leon,
so as to run the trail from Leon to
Chariton, then to Indianola and Des
Moines, as Chariton is more than
anxious to secure the Jefferson High
way, and will leave nothing undone
to secure it. A big delegation from
Cliillicothe and other points in Mis
souri were also in Des Moines last
week, asking that the Highway be
located through Chillicothe, Trenton,
Princton, Lineville, and Chariton. But
we hardly think there will be any

WANT A HOME COMING
A Big Home Coming Celebration is
Planned to be Held at Leon the
Latter Part of August.
Plans are on foot to have a big
Home Coming celebration in Leon
the latter part of August. Leon has
not celebrated for several years, and
there is a demand that we have some
thing of the kind, so it was talked
.over and decided that the proper
thing to have was a real Home Com
ing. A partial canvass of the busi
ness men of the city has been maed
for the purpose of raising the neces
sary funds, and everybody has re
sponded very liberally, although not
enough money has yet been subscrib
ed to guarantee the success of the
Home Coming. Those at the head of
the proposed Home Coming will not
attempt to carry it out unless there
are ample funds with which to secure
the best of attractions for the oc
casion. It is planned to have a three
days Home Coming, and one of the
principal features would bo the com
ing of many former residents of Leon
to this celebration.
A general meeting will be held at
the Commercial Club rooms on Fri
day evening at 8 o'clock, at which
time it will be definitely decided
whe her the project will be carried
out, the dates fixed, committees ap
pointed, an a other arrangeemnts
made. Every citizen of Leon is in
vited to attend this meeting Friday
night. If you are in favor of having
a tiome Coming celebration lend your
aid by attending the meeting Friday
night. To make it a success will re
quire p. lot of work and everybody
should put their shoulder to the
wheel and do their part.
Killed by Lightning.
Monday afternoon Harry Tapscott,
son of Mr. and Mrs. Dave Tapscott,
of Lamoni, was struck by lightning
and instantly killed while plowing
corn in a field near his father's home
in the north part of Lamoni.
His younger brother was working
with another team near him and re
ceived a severe shock from the same
bolt, and one of the horess driven
by Harry was killed. Passersby heard
cries for help and with the father
rushed to the field, but nothing
could be done to revive the stricken
boy. The bolt struck him on the
head, a hole being burned in the
crown of his hat and his shirt and
pants showed the passage of the bolt
clear to his shoes which were also
burned.
The funeral was held at the M. E.
church of which he was a member,
Tuesday afternoon, attended by a
large number of friends and rela
tives.
He was unmarried, about 25 years
of age, and was a graduate of Lamo
ni High School, Graceland College
and Columbia University.

Win in Tennis Tournament.
A. W. Fleet and H. E. Gelatt re
turned Sunday from Council Bluffs,
where they had been competing in
the annual tournament of the South
western Iowa Tennis Association.
The matches were held on the
courts of the Council Bluffs Rowing
Association at Lake Manawa, and ev
erything possible was done to insure
all visitors a good time.
There were about forty entries in
singles and twenty teams in doubles.
Messrs. Fleet and Gelatt won the
double championship and first and
second in consolation singles, bring
ing home a total of six silver cups,
two of which, however, they must
win again before they become their
permanent property.
The single'championship was won
by Frank Nye of Northboro, and he
playing with his brother, Foster Nye,
reached third place in doubles, giv
ing Fleet and Gelatt their hardest
match, and bringing forth some of
the best playing of the tournament.
The meet next year will be at Shen
andoah and The Reporter would like
to see a number of the local players
enter, as this is one of the cleanest
sports we have today.
How Fast Does Corn Grow?
We heard the question asked the
past week, "How fast will corn grow
in favorable weather?" There was
quite a discussion indulged in, no two
persons coming anywhere near agree
ing. We would like to have some of
our farmer friends make a test and
tell us about it.
Recently we heard a gentleman
make the assertion that corn did not
make any growth at all during the
day, doing all of its growing at night,
but a couple of our good farmer
friends dispelled' that idea, for they
went home and put a stake by the
side of a stalk of corn, and both re
ported that the corn did grow during
the day, but not so much as it did
at night.

CLARKE TO THE BENCH.
Cleveland Jurist Will Succeed Chas.
K. Hughes.
John H. Clarke, who has been se
lected by President Wilson to succeed
Charles E. Hughes as associate jus
tice of the United States Supreme
Court, is fifty-one years old and a
bachelor. The only political office
he ever held was the united States
district judgeship in the Cleveland
court to which he was elevated two
years ago by President Wilson. How
ever, Judge Clarke has long been a
leader in the democratic party in the
city of Cleveland and the state of
Ohio.
He has several times been a candi
date for United States senator. His
campaign two years ago was halted
by his appointment to the federal
bench.
Judge Clarke was born at Lisbon,
Ohio, Sept. 18, 1857, attended the
Western Reserve University at Cleve
land, Ohio, was graduated in 1877,
and two years later he moved to
Youngstown where he practiced law
until his removal to Cleveland in
1897. After going to Cleveland,
Judge Clarke was for a number of
years chief counsel to the Nickle Plate
railroad. He is financially interested
in the Youngstown Vindicator, and
has always manifested a deep inter
est in public affairs.
Nick Reed Got What Was Coining to
Him.
Last Tuesday evening United States
Marshal Nick Reed, the fellow who
boasted he would appoint a non-resi
dent republican as postmaster at
Leon, even if it wrecked the demo
cratic party, got what was coming to
him, in the lobby of the Savery
hotel. Reed was in conversation
with C. W. Hoffman, of Leon, and Mr.
Hoffman was calling his attention to
the treatment which the democrats
of Decatur county had received at the
hands of the state organization, for
which Reed was largely responsible,
and in the course of the conversation
Nick had the temerity to call Cal a
liar. In about a quarter of a second
Nick was sprawling on his back on
the floor, and he will be rather care
ful how he addresses loyal Decatur
county democrats hereafter. Cal came
home from Des Moines with & pretty
sore arm, as hundreds of democrats
from all parts of tne state insisted on
shaking hands with him and congrat
ulating him, offering to pay his fine in
case one was imposed, but of course
there was nothing done, as no com
plaint was filed against Mr. Hoffman.
Here is a sample of the newspaper
comment over the affair:
Tuesday evening in the lobby of
the Savery at Des Moines Nick Reed

making a special price of 98c for the
household grinder, and if you once
see it working you will want one for

As was expected, L»r. Reynolds was'
re-elected as member of the state
central committee and as chairman of
the committee at the democratic
state convention held at Des Moines
last week, the organization methods
having been used to good advantage
and nothing left unaone to secure
delegates favorable to Reynolds. Not
withstanding the Decatur county
delegates were instructed against
Reynolds by a unanimous vote of all
the delegates at the county conven
tion, the Leon republican postmaster
made a desperate effort to induce the
delegation to vote for Reynolds and
claimed that a majority of the dele
gation would vote for him. Four
members of the Decatur county dele
gation violated their instructions and
voted for Reynolds, V. R. McGinnis,
F. W. Newcomb, C. R. Piercy and J.

convention, who voted to instruct
against Reynolds will be pretty apt
to remember the delegates who vio

Washington, D. C., July 17.-—"The?

dicted Secretary of Commerce Wil

for paper.
"The indications are that early this
fall when new contracts are made, or
before, there will be further increas

publishers will be unable to get out 1
cent papers without a loss, and an ia

made up alone by the increase in the
