The present dream of the baseball
fans, which it is hoped and likely will,
prove a reality, is the holding of a
monster baseball tournament in Clay
ton in August or September.
Clayton already has a string of vic
tories behind her and with the present
line-up it is contended she will be in
position to meet any amateur aggre
gation, regardless of where they hail
from.
Clayton's strongest rival, Trinidad,
has met defeat twice at the hand of
the locals. They have broken even
with Dalhart, ditto with Texhoma.
This latter team has a normally
strong lineup and on each occasion
Clayton played against a "hand pick
ed" bunch made up of both Texhoma
and Liberal men, the later team her
alded as one of the strongest in the
entire country.
The strongest Pueblo amateur team
even now inspires no terror in the
hearts of the locals ditto Denver.
By the time the latter part of Aug
ust rolls round George's Blues, at the
rae they are gaining form should be
capable of meeting anything that
wears base ball suits this side of the
minor leagues.
A series of ten games at home
against the fastest teams in the coun
try should constitute an immense
drawing card.
VWith a few additional facilities for
accommodating crowds at the baseball
park and a thoro campaign of adver
tising Clayton should be able to carve
a niche in baseball history hitherto
unheard of in the small town class.
As yet the plan for such a tourna
ment has no definite form and much
depends upon the result of the four
games scheduled between Clayton
and Trinidad Saturday and Sunday
nt Trinidad and Monday and Tuesday
at home.

BLUES TO TRINIDAD
Carponter-Snyder
Word was received last evening, by
Dudley Snyder, of the marriage of his
daughter, Miss Lucile, to Dr. Carpen
ter, a specialist of El Paso, Texas.
This is quite a surprise to the friends
of this charming young lady who
join with the Citizen in wishing her
the greatest happness and success in
the future that lies before her. She
wr.s counted as one of the most beau
tiful as well as popular young Indies
of Clayton and she will be greatly
missed in social circles. Her husband
is prominent in his profession in El
Paso and has been known by the Sny
der family for twenty-five years.

Local Socialists Send Resoltuion
President
Local socialists drafted a resolu
tion at a meeting Monday night pro
testing against the raise in postal
rate on second class matter which
seems imminent if the one-cent letter
postage proposition goes into effect.
Socialists maintain that it will put
their party papers out of business as
those publications depend almost en
tirely upon subscription for existance.
The trend of the resolution advocates
advancing the second class price on
papers that carry paid advertising.

There is a pragrnm committee who

Today Mrs. M. R. Jones favored the
teachers with a piano solo, Miss
Georgia Moore gave a select reading
and Miss Ruby Grossaint played an
instrumental selection.
The State Superintendent of Indus
trial Education, Prof. T. C. Mersfelder
of Santa Fe, addressed the Institute
this morning also. Prof. Mersfelder
has his summer headquarters at Las
Vegas and is inspecting the various
educational institutions all over the
northern part of the state. He com
plimented Prof. Errett very highly on
the large attendance, which is one hun
dred and twenty-nine daily and twenty
more thnn the attendance in any oth
er institute in the state, and also on
the excellent faculty engaged to carry
on the work. He also emphasized the
need of more school room and better
facilities for a town as large as Clay
ton. Ralph C. Ely, Chairman of the Re
publican State Central Committee,
will address the teachers Saturday
morning on "Good Citizenship" and
all of Clayton and Union County are
invited to hear this address.
Hoolies Will Entertain
The "Hoolie" evening will be on
Monday of next week and everyone is
anticipating a great time as this is
the social event of the institute.
Four years ago the attendance at
Institute was only fifty-eight At
next session the enrollment was
more than one hundred and it has
steadily increased each year since
then.

Revenge has saccharine oualities,
they say. And there is a certain clan
of birds which is going out to sip a
whole lot of that sweetness the end
of this week, if there is nny way to
make baseball bats meet pitched balls.
Clayton is due for a four-game series,
the first of which contests are to take
place in Trinidad Saturday and Sunday.
Then on Monday and Tuesday the
same teams will clash at Clayton and
Trinidad hopes to make up for the
margin which now exists between the
two nines. For, be it remembered,
Clayton holds two of the victories
which have been gathered against the
Eagles this season, the only other one
having been taken by Van Houten. And
to make up for those two the Eagles
feel that the only thing to do is to take
the entire coming series.
Some great baseball will be staged
when the teams do get together, as
they put up one of the grentest games
seen here a few weeks ago when Clay
ton took an 11-inning contest after the
prettiest sort of a fight.

The letter sent out last week by A.
R. Davis of Raton intimating that Laa
Vegas has designs on the tourist trav
el over the Colorado-to-Gulf high
way has created a whirlwind of pro
test in Las Vegas. The letter was
published in The Citizen and a letter
from O. L. Williams, Secretary of the
New Mexico Mountain Touring Bur
eau, today asks The Citizen to pub
lish a communication that has been
sent to Mr. Davis which is intended
to dispel uneasiness in this part of
country regardng the C-to-G highway.
The Las Vegas folks admit they
want a road, forming a junction it is
supposed, with the Colorado-to-Gulf
at Amarillo.
This being in the United States
there is nothing to prevent Las Vegas
and various good road associations
from constructing all the roads they
can muster kale to build and we, of
this end, that is from information we
have, will not be disposed to call out
the National Guard to thwart the at
tempt. But we must agree with Mr.
Davis in that should a tourist road
form a junction with Colorado-to-Gulf
at Amarillo, then, Dalhart, Clayton
and all of this section of Union county
and Raton to some extent, would feel
it. But, we repeat, there is no law
prohibiting the building of such road
and in event it is constructed it will
resolve to a case of "the best road
wins."
It stands to ronson that another road
will be opened sooner or later and the
only recourse for this section is for the
Highway people to keep th? moss and
rocks from flourishing n'on? the way.
Following is the letter of protest,
which was signed by various officers
of the Las Vegas Commercial Club
and various New Mexico highway as
sociations: They Don't Want The Road Just the

"Dear Mr. Davis:
"We enclose herewith clipping from
a local pnper reproducing an article
which recently appeared above your
signature in the Clayton Citizen.
Since the story seems to have origin

innccurate as to the facts in the case,
we are going to as!: you to kindly
give this correction and denial as much
publicity as you have caused this first
wrong statement to have.

of the Las Vegas Commercial club,
members of the Las Vegas Automobile
association, members of the Texas

we want to affirm that there is no
movement, organized or unorganized,
in this part of New Mexico to change
the present route of the Colorado-to-the-Gulf
highway in any respect. We
wish to assure you that we have no
interest whatever, in the Colorado-to-the-Gulf
highway beyond our general
interest in good roads everywhere, and
our only thought or consideration of
it is our sincere wish for its success.
We believe in good ronds everywhere
especially in New Mexico. While
we have not, and shall not, attempt
to- affiliate with the Colorado-to-the-Gulf

still we are hopeful of its sucess and
would be glad to co-operate with its
officers and management in a general
way to assist and encourage good road
building all over the mountain country.
