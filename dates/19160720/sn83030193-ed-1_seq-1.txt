BALTIMOItK, Md., July JO. Pre
pared to leave port at any moraont,
dpt. Paul Koentr, commander of the
German merchant ubmarln Peuch
land, put on hla uniform to-day tor
th first tlma since ha landed hero
laren days ago and (or several hour
tudted the charts of the I'atapaco
River and Chesapeake Hay with Capt.
Frederick Hlnsch. commander of the
North German Lloyd liner Nockar.
' 'When Capt. Koonle went back
board the undersea liner he took with
Mm a duplicate manifest of the ship's
cargo. Another copy was ready to be
taken to the Custom House.
Capt. Koentic nald he would not
leave hla ship again and Indicated an
arly departure, but said nothing that
would rive an idea Just when tho sub-
twerslbla would leave.
It was understood tho Ueutschland's
. engines and Mibmorslnft machinery
had been riven a final test and wore
found to be In perfect condition.
A gale sweeping the Capos kept
allied warships well out to sea this
morning, as tho submarine was ready
' for a quick dash for tho open.
Tito crow does not share the con
fidence of their communder, Capt
Paul Koonlg, who has said he could
leavo openly with hostile warships
outside tho thrco-mllo limit, and still
have no trouble escaping.
Shoro leavo was cancelled last
"night for tho men. At 11 o'clock the
spars of tho submnrlno wero taken
down and tho conning tower closed.
At MO all lights had been doused.
The tug Thomas J. Tlmmlns was
nearby with a full head of steam,
and numerous launches of tho com.
pany with agents and patrols aboard
kept near. At 11. OS a newspaper
launch was hailed and an otfort
made to havo tho reporters leave.
"You are Interfering with our plans,"
they were told. Heports from Nor
folk said that for twenty miles at
ea no foreign ships could bo seen
fcecause of the storm.
The ton days within which Capt.
ycoenlg cxplalnod ha would leave to
"'avoid the sealing of his wireless have
pad. As the time for sailing ap-
't proaches, the crow of the submarine
i. have become more and moro gloomy.
They make no aecrnt of their fore
bodings and have told their friends at
Locust Point that though Capt. Paul
Koanlg Is doing everything In bis
power to keep up their spirits and
make them look on tho bright side of
the 'affair, the mon cannot see this
id of th venture.
"We art prayina every nlaht and
arc getting our friends to pray for us,"
Second Engineer Karl Fruechte told
a friend he has been spending his eve
nings with since tho crew have been
granted shore leave. "The crow have
Hers to be ready to leave at any mo

this afternoon. "They eannot bring

Balance Sheet Indicates Rocke

' in the World.
CLEVELAND, O.. July tO.i-John D,
Rockefeller's fottuno has passed tho
billion dollar mark. This fact was dis
closed through a balanco sheet, a copy
of which Is saM to be In tho posses
sion of the Cuyahoga County authorl
ties. On tho occasion of Mr. Rocke
feller's seventy. Mvonth birthday on
July the balance sheet showing tho
extent of his holdings was presented
to him. Mr. Itockofoller Is at bis
Cleveland homo at present
This billion dollar Dalanc Is exclu
sive of endowment funds and other
benefactions and shows that the Oil
King 1 the wealthiest man In the world
and possibly the richest man that th
world has ever known.
Cuyahoga County Is seeking to fore
Mr. Rockefeller tit pay taxes on hold
ings of over $300,000, and the discovery
of the billion dollar balance sheet
greatly please the authorities In their
attempt. In October, 1910, Mr. Rocke
feller secured an Injunction to prevent
tax collections on his Cuyahoga County
holdings and the county has filed on
appeal In the United States Circuit
Court.
Furthermore, It has been discovered
that tho Rockefcllor Cortuno Is grow
ing so rapidly that the possessor
cannot dlaroso of his Income. One
of tho amazing features of tho Im
mense fortuno Is that stock fluctua
tions Increase or decrease the total
by us much ns a million dollar a
duy. The fortuno Is said to have In
creased tremendously since June,
Tho Rockefellers, father and son,
have given away fully 1200,000,000
alnce 1910. Since the outbreak of
the European war the Rockefeller
Foundation has given away about
110,000,000 for relief work.
Of the enormous total of tho Rock
efeller fortune nearly $500,000,000
represents Mr, Rockefeller's holdings
In tho vurlous Standard Oil com
panies anil their subsidiaries. He
holds approximately 247,962 shares
out of u total of 883,383 shares Issued
In all of the companies. The stock Is
now quoted around 11,700, about threo
times what It was before the Federal
courts Issued the order dissolving tho

DliATH SCENE IS TOLD.
Dr. Harris May Recover From
Wounds and Aid Inquiry
"Brain Storm" Defense.
IIOSTON, July 20. Hospital physi
cians attending Dr. Wilfred K. Harris,
President of tho Massachusetts Col
lege of Osteopathy, said to-day that ha
had a "lighting chanco" to recover
from the throe bullet wound Inflicted
Tuesday by Dr. Kldrldg D. Atwood,
also an osteopath. Tho physician re
ported that Dr. Harris passed a "fair
ly comrortublo night," and that ho
probably would llvo unless peritonitis
or other complications developed.
While the physicians wero exerting
every effort to savo tho life of tho pa
tient tho pollco rero encdavorlng to
clear up the mystery surrounding tho
death by poisoning of Dr. Cclla Adams,
Or. Atwood's fiancee, which occurred
a few houra before the ahootlng of Or.
Harris. The autopsy failed to roveal
"when, where and under what circum
stance this poison was received."
Dr. Atwood told th police he left
Miss Adams about 11 o'clock Monday
night at tho Park Street subway sta
tion and that he first learned the next
morning that she had been found un
conscious lit her oftlce.
It was sold to-day by the police that
sho regained consciousness for a mo
ment und mado several attempts to
speak to a physician who asked hor
If sho had taken poison. 8)10 did not
reply, but nodded her head and point
ed a finger across the room.
Ortlcluls In charge of the Investiga
tion do not believe, however, that Miss
Adams realized what sho was doing.
The pollco also havo made further
efforts to ascertain whether she was
alono In her oftlce on Monday night.
An analysis of tho young woman's
organs was being mado to-day by a
chemist to determine tho nature of the
poison that caused her death.

Thero will be no moro policemen

of Infantile paralysis. Beginning to

Evonlng World's expos of condition
In Brooklyn last Monday when, seven
111x10 patient wore left outside a
saloon, while tho physician In charge
and the policeman cntorod to drink
beer and eat sandwiches.
The Immediate rosult of the expose
was that Dr. Leonard II. Crosby, the
physician on tbe ambulance, waa dis
missed from tha service, and Zachary
j Dates, tho policeman, was placed un-
der suspension ponding his trial be
forefore Deputy Police Commissioner
Oodley on charges of neglect of duty
and conduct unbecoming an officer.
"Wo thought we might be able to
use policemen on the ambulances,
but have discovered that It I beat

Commissioner Emerson, The Com
missioner also stated that more
stringent watches would bo kept on

force of men were requested from tho
Police Department to reinforce the
ranks of the Health Department
squad. These offlccra will make one
or moro visits each day to all quaran
tined homes to seo that the regula
tions aro being obe.'cd.
This step was hastened when Tho
Evening World brought to tha at
tention of Commissioner Emerson
the case of Frank Stoothoff of No.
230 Ellery Avenue, Williamsburg.
Stoothoff lost hi four-year-old son,
William, on Friday. Tha Health Do

after making an examination of the

In a call to tho Kingston Avenuo
Hospital for an ambulance. That
was last Saturday night Sunday
passed and Monday arrived without
tho appearance of the ambulance.
The desperuto father on Monday
afternoon wrapped up tho child anil
boarding a street car took It to tho
hospital. Vrstcrday morning the nm
bulance arrived at the house.
