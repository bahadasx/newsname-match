Free Scholarships
We wish to heartly second Mr.
Cooper, candidate for Governor,
in his position on free scliolarships.
lie advocates instead ol'
the scholarships a loan to the
stndent which is to he repaid
after school days are over at the
beneficiary'8 conveniens". However
we want this loan fund to
be available to the bovs and
girls, from the first grade on up
as we can see no valid reason
why the system has been as it is
thac we help the college student
and fail to help the pupils cf the
common schools. We have always
contended that if any hoy
and girl is the possessor of a
common school education that a
college course is easily obtained
where there is the right effort
on their part.
Now as to the linancial part
of the proposition let us suppose
that in this state we spend
$100,000.00 on scholarships.
Convert this into a loan fund as
shown above. If only se.venty
Vi tive per cent repay loans (which
we submit is a larger, per cent
of non payers than would actually
materialize) then the State
is only out $25,000.00 as aaainst
the $100,000.00 as expended un,
der the old plan. This surplus
would make a nice fund for loans
to common school students, and
remember this that instead of
being an object of charity, as
under our present system, the
recipient would, under the loan
plan, be eitnply the borrower
under a business proposition.
^Next week we shall endeavor to
show that more than one-half
tho girls and boys of this and
other counties who have been
educated under the scholarship
plan have been children of par
ents who were well able to gjve
them an education without ask

Wind and Rain Cause
Losses In Chesterfield
The severe rain and wind
storm that swept the State the
latter part of last week was at
its worst in Chesterfield County
Friday afternoon and night,
when the wind at times attained
a velocity of about SO miles and
the rain fell in torrents.
On Saturday it seemed that
the crops, corn and cotton, were
all but ruined, but these have
since shown recuperative powers
equal to the Russian army and
it is now believed that the total
crop damage will not exceed 25
per cent. The general conditions
that have prevailed for
several days have been a great
boon, as a hot sun with the land
so wet, would have caused great
damage.
The railroads thoughout the
State have been heavily hit, it
being impossible for a time to
get a train through to Atlanta
or .oven to Columbia. The C. &
L. in Chesterfield County, however,
got oil' very light, with only
one trestle damaged and that
between Chesterfield and Cheraw.
Trains were running on
this line by Monday.
The damage to the County
property while heavy, was light
compared to that suffered by adjoining
counties. A rough estimate
places our losses in bridges
and damaged roads at $25,000 to
$110,000. Florence County lost
in b-idges alone $00,000.
Of nine bridges crossing
Lynches River, two are left intact.
All five of the county
bridges crossing Juniper Creek
are gone. Four bridges on Bear
Creek are down; two gone on
Black Creek and one damaged.
Nothing definite could be learned
from Cedar creek and territory.
All bridges between Chesterfield
and Cheraw remain undamaged
These bridges were modern
steel structures and must
have been properly erected as
nowhere did the water approach
nearer than four feet to the
structure. Right here is food
for thought: nearly all of the
wooden bridges wfre destroyed;
not one of the steel bridges was
damaged!
The mill dams suffered heavily
throughout the county. Hursey's
dam on the ChesterfieldPageland
road broke; Ingram's
dam on the W.-A. Highway
blew out for a distance of 42
feet; Evans' dam broke in two
places; (hint's dam shlFeredl
heavily also; the dam at Teal's)
mill held.
A great many (iall were taken
from Evans' pond on Monday
and it is probable that other
ponds produced a like quantity
of food for man while the water
waR low after the break.
Kesidea the bridges and mill
dams mentioned, numerous fills
have been damaged or destroyed.
The "August flood of 1908"
, seems to have held the local
record since the "Sherman fresh(
el of 1865*" The water in
Thompson's creek on Saturday
, reached the record mark of 1908,
( which is the keyhole in the door
( at Craig's Mill. Some damage
was done here to new unpacked
, electric machinery, though h.?w
, serious, could not be learned. J

[o Protect Health,
America's First Duty
Washington, D. O., July 14.?
The estimated economic loss
rhieh our nation suffers each
ear from typhoid fever and mairia
alone aggregates $928,234,
80, leaving out of entire account
he sorrow, the unhappiness,
he misery, and the inefficiency
yhich follow in their train."
Senator Joseph E. Ransdell of
jouisina today addressed the
Senate on the subject of "Rural
lealth, America's First Duty."
"The greatest asset which our
iountry can have" saul Sen:or
Ransdell, "is the healthy
American citizen, and valuable
is it may be to increase the
liealth of livestock and vegetation,
it is of far greater import
ince that we throw every possible
safeguard about the health oi
the man who is responsible foi
that livestock and vegetation.
Over 900 million dollars lo.-l
every year! A sum which is
sullicient to put our country intc
a state of nreDarednesp eoua1 tc
that of any nation in the world
enough money to give us thf
largest navy afloat and the mosl
efficient army which the world
has ever seen, is annually offer
ed up as a sacrifice to two dis
eases which are entirely prevetv
table. Enough money to paj
the annual expense of every col
lege student in the United State
is absolutely thrown away ever^
year."
Senator Ransdell estimate
the grand total loss from typhoii
fever at $271,032,880 per annun
and the loss from malaria a
$<594,004,750 per year; the tota
per capita loss from those tw
diseases being $0.40. By con"
parative estimates it was show
that the United States (lovori
ment appropriated $5,016,175 fr
the investigation and preyentio
of the diseases of animal an
plant life and only $2,917,56
for the investigation and prevei
tion of the diseases of man.
