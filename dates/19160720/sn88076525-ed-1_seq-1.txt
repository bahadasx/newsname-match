SR ROGER'S PLEA IS TURNED
DOWN BY ENGLISH COURT.
London, July 18.—Without hearing
the attorneys for the crown the court
of .criminal appeal today dismissed Sir
Koger Casement's appeal from the
verdict of the lower court which found
jiim guilty of treason Tor which Vis
count-Reading, the lord chief justice,
sentenced him to death.
For a day and a half Alexander Sul
livan, Sir Roger's counsel, argued be
fore the court, quoting many author
ities in favor of his contention that the
offense of treason depended upon
whether the accused dwelt under the
protection of the king and that the
crime could not be committed without,
the realm. He abandoned his other
points in regard to the lord chief jus
tice's definition of the offense.
Against Sir Roger.
As soon as Mr. Sullivan had con
cluded his argument the court retired
to consider whether the attorneys for
the crown would be called on to "reply.
It was soon decided... to the contrary,
which indicated that the appeal had
gone against Sir Roger, who was pres
ent during the argument and whe

judgment was- given.
A further appeal to the house of
lords is possible only if the attorney
general gives a certificate that the de
cision of the court of criminal appeal
involves a point of law so exceptional­
important that it is desirable in
thepublic interest that a still higher
court should deal with it.This has been
done only twice since the court of
criminal appeal was established eight
years ago.
Praises Sullivan.
Justice Darling, in delivering the
judgment, expressed the indebtedness
•f the court to Mr. Sullivan for his
well considered and well delivered ar
guments, as the justice characterized
them, adding that they were worthy
of the best traditions of the king's
courts, but he declared that they had
been answered by the attorneys of the
•rown at the first trial.
Attorney Michael Francis Doyle of
Philadelphia, of counsel for Sir Roger,
declared today that it was ^improbable
the attorney general would certify the
case for appeal to the house of lo Is,
as the appeal court did not consi 'or ii
necessary to hear arguments for the
government.
Powerful influences are working for
a reprieve, said the attorney, and
there were strong hopes of one being
granted.
FAMILIES CANNOT BE
EVICTED WHILE
MEN ARE SERVING
Pittsburgh, Ju!y 18.—Families of
isoldiers in the service of this state or
"the federal government, cannot be
evicted by civil process for non-pay
ment df rent while the soldiers are in
such service. Since the militia unit?
in Pittsburgh went to the front hun
dreds of families have been notified
to pay their rent or move out. Mayor
Joseph G. Armstrong and City Solic
itor Charles A. O'Brien will enforce
the state law passed by the 1815 leg
islature providing against just such
a contingency. Payments of rents
cannot be forced until thirty days af
ter the soldier has been mustered out
of service. The law of April 9, 1915,
is a barrier against landlord warrants

AUSTRIAN ATTACKS BUT WITH
OUT SUCCESS,
London, July 18.—With the excep

south oif' the Blaches, relative calm
prevailed on the fighting front in
France.
The British and Germans are engag
ed in a sanguinary conflict in the re

northwest of Confcles.
With the clearing of the weather,
the GeraJmns have taken the aggres

bardment in which a new asphyxiat
ing gas shell was used.
No Decision Reached.
At last account, no decision ha
been reached in the battle.
To the south of the Somme, the
French wd Germans are still at grips
at Blaches where the French have
driven out the Germans from some of
the houses they held in the village.
The Germans failed on Tuesday to
renew their attack between Blaches
and La Maisonette in which the
French inflicted Juavy casualties on
them Monday jpghk

New Victories for Italy.
In the Autro-Italian theater, Rome

over the Austrians at various points.
While Petrograd announces furth

Russian right wing, Constantinople
says that in recent days on the cen

ed tremendous losses south of the
Tchoruk river and that their attack
have become less violent.
Heavy Cannonading
Cannonading is going on along the
entire front in the region of the Greek
border between the forces of the Teu
tonic and entente allies.
Aor raiders of the entente allies
have done considerable damage with
bombs in the region of Monastir.
WHEN TO CUT ALFALFA.
Alfalfa plants are weakened when
cut too early. At the Kansas Epxeri
ment Station a two year trial brought
out the fact that alfalfa cut when 1-10
in bloom and when in full bloom gave
the most hay. Less hay was secured
wh6n the alfalfa was cut in the bud
stage and the alfalfa was weakened
so that weeds secured a foothold. A
few weeds appeared in the alfalfa cut
when 1-10 in bloom, but no weeds ap
peared in the alfalfa cut in full bloom
and when ripe. From the standpoint
of hay yield and the keeping up of
the alfalfa the time to cut alfalfa is
when between 1-10 in bloom and full
bloom.—N. D. Experiment Station.

DEATH OF MISS
News of the death of Miss Valborg
Lee came as a severe shock to the
many friends and relatives of the
young lady. The first supposition was
that death was caused by drowning
but the doctor's autopsy showed that
death was due to heart failure.
Miss Lee and her sister were guests
of Mrs. Fred Besse, another sister,
who is spending the summer at Chau
tauqua. The young ladies had been
berrying and upon their return to the
cottage, Miss Lee decided to go in
bathing, leaving the cottage for the
lake shore about 5:30. After half an
hour her sister became alarmed and
went in esarch of her but reassured by
someone at the shore she returned to
the cottage. Shortly after a man who
had been doing some work at the boat
club found the body close to the shore.
Miss Lee is the daughter of C. O.
