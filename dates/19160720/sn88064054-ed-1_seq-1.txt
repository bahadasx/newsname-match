FUIITIYE SLAYS ST,
LANDDY SHERIFF
Shot Iown iBy A Half-Breed
I)esperado Whom lie
Tried To Arrest
Marion L. Swords, sheriff of St.
Landry Parish, was shot and killed
in a section known as Mallet Woods
about ten miles from Opelousas at
4:55 Monday morning by Hilaire
Carriere, a white desperado whom'
he was trying to arrest. Two
negro guides of the sheriff, were
d mrnerously wounded.
The murderer who is allejed to
have k.lled a negro sometime ago and
is a fugitive from justice from
Jefferson Davis Parish, had been
hiding in the woods for several
weeks, and was known as a bad
man throughout the section.
Sheriff Swords went out to arrest
him and located him in a house
which was surrounded and guarded
all night. Early the next morning
Carriere was seen in a corn field
near by, and when sheriff Swords
approached he was shot through the
heart by the desperado, death re
sulting instantly. Posses are in
pursuit, and if apprehended it is
very likely that a lynching will
follow.
Marion L Swords was a most
unique figure in Louisiana polictics.
He held the office of sheriff for
sixteen years, during all of which
time he was a most ardent supporter
of the democratic party. and in the
last election took a most active part
and stumped the state in the interest
of Governor Pleasant.
His son Merrick W. of New Or
leans is a candidate for appointment
to the presidency of the Louisiana l
State Board of Health.

baseball team and will tour the
surrounding country, playing other
towns at the many summer resorts.

Lain were quietly married at the
Baptist parsonage last Friday, Rev.

Dance At Colonial

tained their friends at a dance Fri
day evening at the Colonial Hotel.

Tuesday held at the Y. M. C. A. e
A card of thanks as follows was

participated in the ball game.
The Bogalusa Patriotic Club C
hereby wishes to extend to all who
participated in the ball game Sat- tl
urday, and from which such a hand-i n
some sum was realized. its most
profound thanks, for their generosity ti
and public spiritness in helping the I
noble cause. (Signed' a

.JO()IIN MI. PARKER
politi:1
Declaring that political leaders had used the Southern vote for fifty
years "to give them an absolute grip on national affairs, and enable the
Republican party, through its political bosses, to nominate whom it
pleased," John M. Parker issued a statement Saturday night in which he
denounced the Progressives who had rejoined the Republican party from
which they succeeded and called upon all patriotic men and women of
America to hold a convention at Chicago, August 5, and nomirate can
didates for President and Vice-President of the United' States.
FATS TRIM LEANS IN INTERESTING
GAME BY SCORE OF NINE TO EIGHT'
The ball game between the Fats.
and the Leans, which was played at
the local grounds last Saturday and
was won by the Fats by the score
of 9 to 8, brought out a large sized
crowd notwithstanding the fact that
the most threatening weather pre
vailed. The game, which went six
innings when it was called on ac
count of rain, was replete with many
brilliant plays, both Cowgill and
Moore of the Fats making a sensa
tional catch each, which would have
done credit to some of the big league
stars.
The Fats appeared on the field in
clown costumes, and after a few
minutes practice, play was called by
Mayor Sulllivan, who acted as um
pire. The less said about his um
piring the better, but even though'
he did allow the Leans four outs in
one inning and five in another, his
bad decisions were so evenly divi
ded between both sides that neither
one had a kick coming.
The Fats stole a march on their
opponents by bringing in a ringer
in the person of J. Vol Brock, the
district attorney, who played first
base in a masterly manner.
The pitchers were in fine shape.
Major Wood, who twirled for the
Fats, had his fade-away and spit
ball working to perfection. and the'
control he displayed was simply
marvelous. Some of his inshoots
went by so fast that even the um
pire did not know what to call it
a ball or strike---until the Major
himself was consulted.
Without a doubt there is some
big league timber in Bogalusa, and'
it is to be regretted that some of
the big league scouts were not pres
ent to see the work of the players.
A goodly sum was realized'
from the gate, and the proceeds
were all turned over to the Patriotic
Club, who extend their heartfelt
thanks to all those who helped
make the game a success.
Not only are the men who par
ticipated to be congratulated, but
also the ladies who, by their tireless
efforts, disposed of the tickets and
had charge of the gate, and who are
devoting a big share of their time
to the noble work of looking after
the interests of those who resnonded
to their country's call, are to be
highly complimented.
NOTES OF THE GAME.
D. T. Cushing nearly caught one
once.
Out of several chances Ed Cassidy
finally got one on the first bound.
That catch made by Moore was a
jim-dandy.
When it comes to covering ground
our friend Cowgill is there with bells
on.
Tom Copeland, landed often
enough, only he couldn't get them
where "nobody wasn't."
A. M. Cesario, after getting a hit
and half way to second on it, finally
decided that there was a better
breeze near first and went back.
Judge Ott is some sprinter. He
circled the bases a-la-Ty Cob,
That fall that Herscher took was
the most graceful seen here for some
time.
Porter was on the job all the
time, both in the field and at the
bat.
After Spekenhier had crossed the
plate once, he decided that he didn't
want all the laurels and retired in
favor of Pete Willoughby.
Flourney is a lot better at catch
ing law-breakers than he is at catch
ing fly balls.
That man Brock took everything
that came his way. High ones, low
ones, hard ones, all looked alike to
him.
W. H. Sullivan would do well um
piring in the big league-maybe.
Did you notice the drop on Major
Wood's spitter? No pitcher in the
big league ever pitched like that.
He wouldn't dare to.
Earl Lear had some speed, but
it didn't work just right.
J. J. Morris covered lots of ground.
Archer would undoubtedly make
a hit at club-swinging.
Sticks Letton didn't let a thing
get by him.
Leopold Saux took care of every
thing in his territory in the same
way he cares for his guests-in tip
top shaue.
Red Hailey "'checked up" and ac
counted for everything within his
reach.

CONDITIONS AT CAMP
STAFFORO ARE IDEAL
Everything Moves With
Clock--Like Regularilty
And I)ispatch
The "stay-at-homes" have but a
faint conception of the everyday
doings at Camp Stafford, and a day
recently spent at the Camp proved
that the entire Camp is conducted
with clock-like regularity and pre
cision.
At 5 a. m. the troops appear for
reveille. Immediately after inspec
tion is made, and those that fail to
appear at the appointed time, are
sentenced to a little extra labor.
such as cleaning up, etc. At 6:45
breaklfast is served, and though the
food is plain it is of the most sub
stantial kind.
From 7 until 9 drilling is indulged
in, and it is surprising to see how
many of the boys who, a few weeks
ago, were classed as "rookies" are
now first class soldiers.
From 9:30 until 11 individual
drilling takes place, and at 12
o'clock the call for dinner is sounded.
From then on until 5:30 there is
very little doing and many of the
boys, after obtaining permission
from the captain, journey to the
city for the afternoon. (The Camp
is within easy access to Alexandria,
autos making the round trip for
fifty cents.)
Retreat, which comes at 5:30, is
one of the most inspiring ceremon
ies that a true blooded American
can imagine. The soldiers all line
up in the company street. the bugle
is blown and one shot fired. Then
to the air of The Star Spangled
Banner, Old Glory is slowly lowered,
the officers salute and the day's
work is practically over.
Supper is served at 6 p. m. and
then again the time belongs to the
boys to spend in whatever manner
they may desire, but they cannot
leave camp without permission.
At 9 o'clock 'tatoo" is sounded,
forty-five minutes and the call to
"quarters," and at 10 o'clock "taps."
All lights are out and the camp is
in peaceful slumber.
The boys of Company G are all
enjoying the best of health, and all
are anxious to get to the border.
There are several amusing inci
dents occurring every day, such as
sending some new recruit out to
bring in a "bucket of detail" or to
gather in twenty yards of skirmish
line and bring it to camp.
Good fellowship prevails through
out, and the entire Camp is not un-I
like one great big happy family,

Heintz in City
Fred (Bud) Heintz, candidate
for district attorney was in Boga
lusa the latter part of the week in
the interest of his candidacy and
sbhaking hands with his many
friends.
The people of Bogalusa and Wash
ington Parish will no doubt hail
with great delight the news that the
new million dollar paper mill will
be in course of construction within
the next thirty days.
G. H. Wood who will have charge
of the construction work, accom
panied by Messrs, L. H. Beyfogle,
who will be general superintendent,
Per Deline, who will have charge of
the pulp mill. Skeldon and Win
chell, all experienced men in the
manufacture of paper arrived in
Bogalusa Monday night.
Plans are now nearing completion,
most of' the machinery has been
ordered, and in a short time the
site of the new mill will be a verit
able bee-hive of laborers, both skill
ed and unskilled, and from the
moment that the first spade-full of
earth is thrown the plant will be
rushed to completion.
Plans For Y. W. C. A. Ready
The plans for the new Y. W. C. A.
which through the courtesy and
generosity of the Goodyears is to be
erected next to the Y. M. C. A.
building have been completed and
accepted. and work on this
building will also begin in a very
short time. Rathbone DuBuys the
well known architect of New Orleans.
spared no pains in making the plans
to give Bogalusa one of the most
up-to date buildings of its 1knd in
the south. With the two ne'v in
stitutions going up, and with the
natural increase of population that
Bogalusa is bound to enjoy, it is a
safe prediction to make that the
City Unusual will reach its coveted
goal of twenty-five thousand in
11920.
Progressive Rook Party
Miss Sara Pierce entertained at a
Progressive Rook Party Friday
afternoon. A delightful salad course
was served. It proved to be one

bridge at the edge of Denhamtown
where a delightful lunch was served.
Games of various kinds and also
bathing were enjoyed throughout
the day.
Buays Overland
Maurice Tate has purchased an
Overland car from H. E. Rester, the
local agent.
E. C Edwards, a hustling insur
ance agent, has also purchased an
Overland car from the local agent.
