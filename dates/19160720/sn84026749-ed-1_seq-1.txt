Senator Denounces Increased
Expenditures in Urging Re

IN TILT WITH BRANDEGEE
Connecticut Member Declares
Wisconsin Colleague's Plan
Is Impractical.
Fiercely assailing the increased
military appropriations for this
year, and insisting on the adoption
of his amendment that new battle
ships be restricted to uses of de
fense, Senator La Follette today
engaged in a spirited debate with
Senator Brandegee of Connecticut.
In the. course of the debate La
Follette strongly intimated that he
might support President Wilson in
preference to former Justice
Hughes.
Apparently his amendment
forbidding the yse of this year's
battleships to collect debts owed
by foreign1 governments or their
cftlrens to American investors or
ooncessionairies was near a vote.
"What has happened," he de
manded, "that we should increase
"our military appropriations from
$420,000,000 last year to $840.
000.000 this year? , f

"The people are going to know
whether these Increased appropria
tions are for their defense or to set
America on a new scheme of militar
ism to collect individual debts owed
American bondholders and concession
ayes, to pile up munitions profits.
'The people will know! Beware the
Ides of November!"
Brandegce Denounces Plan.
Brandegee-denounced the La Follette
plan on the grcunds that Americans
with Investments In Mexico or similar
lands would be left dependent on
t "Carransa Justice."
"What becofios," he said, "of Amer
icans who have Invested In other
lands, who have Improved those lands.

ments Justly due them. I have had as
an attorney difficulty In collecting
such debts until the strong arm of the

"Regarding the ration," the report of
Qenerat Buss said, "all commanding
oftlceis Interviewed by me have stated

Fifth Victim of Infantile Paraly
sis Found in a Downtown
Hotel Today.
The nrst case of Infantile paralysis
In Washington, which can bo traced di
rectly to New York, whero the disease
has been epidemic, was located today
In a downtown hotel, and was report
ed to the Health Department.
The patient, a girl five years old, ar
rived in Washington on July 2, from
a Potomac river resort, where she was
taken following the appearance of Ill
ness. Sho left New York on June 28.
The physician who reported the case
says It la of mild type, and that the
temperature of the patient has boen
normal for thliteen days. The reason
It was not reported sooner, It was
stated. Is beca'ise the disease was not
rocngnlzed.
Dr. W. C. Fowler, head of the con
tagious disease service of the Health
Department, will visit the patient this
afternoon.
He said today that from the descrip
tion of the symptoms given by tne phy
sician in 'charge there was little aouot
as to the nature of the disease.
Under the District regulations patients
suffering from infantllo paralysis whoso
temperature has been normal lor two
weeks are released from quarantine.
Whether this will be permitted In this
case, however, has not been determined.
In view qt the" connections with the
Mew York epidemic the health authon
tlesmay decide that further Isolation
is necessary.
The total number of cacif Infantile
paralysis on record in the District Is
hve. 'ihe case reported today is tne
nrst to be directly traced to New Xorx,
although there is a suspicion that
another may be connected with the epi
demic In that city.
Subsea Boat Made
Ready During Night
Hatches Fastened and Masts Tele
scoped, Leaving Only the
Periscope Visible.
BALTIMORE. Md.. July . Dawn to
day found the German subset freighter
Deutschland still docked here, Hanked
by obscuring barges and the protecting
tug Tlmmlns.
Maneuvers before. daylight led to the
belief that she Intended to make a dash
for the capes, but what her plans now
may be is hidden In a mystery deeper
and darker than the mud beneath her.
A run for tho capes before or a'ter
nightfall, however, seems logical and
probable.
During the night the Deutschland
hatches were fastened, and her foro
and aft masts telescoped, so that only
her powerful periscope showed.
Until well into tho early morning
hours, the nervous light aboaid Uio
llmmlna circled the Patapsco. Finally,
after threats of prosecution for viola
tion of the navigation laws, the light
wait put out.
Captain Hlnsch. transportation man
ager for the new freighters. Is whisper
ing to his friends that the Bremen will
dock here by Saturday. Certainly,
everything points that way and to the
cleparturo or tne ueutasmana euner si
multaneously or earlier.
Members of the crew scoffed at pub
lished reports that thev fear death on
the return Journey, through capture in
allied suDmartne nets.

Its Wireless Is Unsealed
There will be ono sure Indication of
the Deutschland'a readiness for Immedi

That will be the breaking of the seals
on her wireless apparatus and this must
be done with the

WASHINGTON, THURSDAY EVENING,
ONE MAN GIVES
DRY CAMPAIGN
John P. Coffin, of Florida, Is
Hero of Prohibition Conven
tion In St. Paul.
NOMINATION IS DUE TODAY
J. Frank Hanly of Indiana, Is
Likely To Be Named to Head
Party Ticket.
ST. PAUL, July 20. The Pro
hibition National Convention is
going to nominate some one
probably J. Frank Hanly, of Indi
ana for President today, but a
a little old mnn from Johnston,
Fla., is its hero.
This little old man sat pretty far
back in the convention hall and
talked to his gray-haired, motherly
looking little wife, who shared the
honors.
They are Mr. and Mrs. John P.
Coffin, who "own 12,000 acres of
land down in Florida, but act and
look just like the rest of the "home
folks" who are attending the con
vention. CONTRIBUTIONS ASKED.
This was all they did:
The Probltlonlsts need money to run
a campaign. The chairman had called
for contributions as they were coming
In slowly.
A voice In the hall said something
about 160,000. '
"What's, that r th? crowd shouted.
Coffin's gray head popped up from the
Florida delegation.
" "Yes, 'that's what I said," he said.
"Put me down for Wfioo."
The convention Sheered, and dele
gates toppled over their chairs to got
to Coffin. The picked him up and car
ried him to the platform. Mrs. Coffin
looked embarrassed, but they picked
her up, too. and carried her up there
with him.
Coffin's contribution Is believed to be
the largest ever made for a Prohibition
campaign. His pledge started tho ball
rolling, and funds came In fast otter
that.
.The collection was Just like one of
those donation parties they hive for
country ministers. Those who didn't
have money gave other things.
une man tossea into tne pot a mort
gage for 1158.68 on some Illinois law
books, and told tho collectors to get
after the money.
The old-fashioned camp meeting style
of convention is to see some "steam
rollering" today.
The faction backing Hanly for Pre!
dent has control, and plans to nomi
nate him, adopt a platform, and ad
journ tonight, ono day In advance of
scheduled time.
To check the steam roller. William
Sulzer, former governor of New York,
the other candidate for President, Is
expected hero to attempt a stampede
for himself.
Out of a mass of suggestions placed
before them by enthusiasts on almost
every subject under the sun, the con
vention's platform committee haS fairly
well worked out Its principal planks.
The Susan B. Anthony suffrage
amendment, an eight-hour day for
worklngmen. several other "social Jus
tice" planks, a program of preparedness
for peace only. Government ownership
of armor plants, and support of var
ious farmers' movements were the prin
cipal Issues decided on, and, of course,
national prohibition.
CHORUS GIRL FAMINE
GRIPS BROADWAY
Show Builders Need, 1,400 of New
Type for 1916.
NEW YORK. July 80 Woeful tidings,
these, to the tired business men.
There's a shortage In chorus girls.
Sixteen hundred are needed for
Broadway musical comedies now in the
making and so far only SOO have been
lncAtpd who measure uo to the stand
ards required by such caterers to tho
eye of audiences as Wed VVeyPurn,
Chamberlain Brown. Bruce Edwartld,
and the rest of them.
First of all, let It bo explained that
the 1916 chorus girl will have to be a
beauty. Patrons of tho girl shows now
adays want moro curves, more pep,
more voice, and moro girls, than ever
before, the experts say.
The 1816 type must be slender but not
angular, must know how, to dance well
and must smile. Also she must have
good looking bare feet, and er blush
ing skin on her cr limbs, because
tights are no longer au fait.
The chorus glrlVcW think tho lure
of the movies, the ci bunn, and tho
dance halls havo all combined to rob
thi stage of l's usual -i ntiiluition.

consider Immediately this Government's
appeal for a Polish relief agreement.
This Is the first of live countries ap

Maryland Approves Plan to
Block Qff Lower Potomac
WitU Railroad Drawbridge
State Board of Publio Works
0. K.'S Proposed Span Near
'Colonial Beach.
BUT CONGRESS MUST ACT
Structure Camiot Be Erected
Unless Federal Government
Qjves Consent.
A railroad draw-bridge, blocking tho
Potomao river Just this side 'of Colonial
Beach, Is a disconcerting propect offi
cially approved by the State of Mary
land. In the optnloon of persons well quali
fied to apeak on the matter the proposed
brldgo wlll seriously Interfere with
Washington's growing water traffic
and will discourage the visit to this city
of big steamers and naval vessels. It Is
up tto Coongress to protect the Interests
of Washington.
With an unexpectedness In keeping
with the boldness of the project, the
Board of Public Works of Maryland
yesterday gave Its O. IC. to the proposal.
The site selected for the bridge Is at
Riverside, Charles county, Md., the
proposition being to connect Riverside
with Metomkln, In King George county,
Va., and establish railroad communica
tion between Baltimore and Newport
Nows,
The Maryland board has decided the
Potomac and Baltimore Railroad Com
pany may construct the draw-bridge.
Fortunately, however, the consent of
Congress Is necessary before a blrdge
is constructed across a navigable
stream. It Is not assumed that Con
gress will so hurriedly go about the
matter of permitting an obstruction of
the Potomac.
Fight To Be Shifted.
The permission obtained by the Mary
land railroad to cross the Potomac
with a span of steel indicates that the
tight for the privilege will now be trans
t erred to Washington. Uojh Congress
and the War Department will be asked
to approve the project.
Tho importance or this fight- from tne
Washington viewpoint, can', haruiy be
overestimated.
If Washington .were a provincial town
on an brdlnary river llttlo Interest would
attach to a plan to build a railroad
drawbridge some miles away. The re
flected commercial benents or such a
project might appeal to the munici
pality. it so happens, howevor. that wasn
Ington is the National Capitol. There is
a United mates navy yard here, ine
city Is visited by big ships that fly the
flags of all nations. Warships, tramp
steamers, old-fashioned schooners, and
excursion boats sail out of Chesapeake
bay and Into the Potomac waterway
that leads to Washington.
Naval vessels and big steamers do not
tit In with drawbridges, no matter how
modern and workable the bridges may
be. Hie construction or a draworiage
across the lower Potomac would consti
tute the first step in shutting wasn-
ingion on irom tne Aiianuc.
No Objection Above.
Above ho wharf and Novy Yard
there is little objection to bridges across
the Potomac It Is spanned by ucvcral.
but no large vessels want to pass under
or through these structures and batcaus
nnd launches, rather than ocean-going
steamers and naval vessels, ply the
waters aDout tne mgnway anu Aque
duct bridges.
It probably will tc granted that rail
road connection between Baltimore and
Newport News, and the opening up of
tho territory In between, would bo de
sirable from a certain standpoint.
When this must be accomplished, how
ever, by a ipan across the Potomac
river that interferes rerlously with the
Capital's outlet to Chesapeake Bay the
most serious objections will be raised
In Congress and elsewhere.
Roallzlng the Importance of keeping
open navigable streams Congress has
expressly reserved to Itself tho privi
lege of vetoing any proposal to build

McRoberts Coming Home
Hails Russia's Future
STOCKHOLM. July 20. After spend
ing two months In Russia, during which
time he arranged a loan of 150,000,000 to
the Russian government and tlso pro
vided for the establishment of branch
banks, Samuel McRoberts, senior vice
president of the National City Bank In
New York, sails today for New York t n
board the steamer lSergensfjord.
Mr. McRoberts made a careful study
of conditions In Russia.
"Tho war." he said, "has awakened
Russia boyorfd all conception, and that
country now offers a wonderful oppor
tunity to American capital and business
ontemrlses. The nooDle of America
do not appreciate the extent of the Rus
sian market or Russian resources, but
should prepare now for a great Russian
trade after the war.
"I traveled for three days through
territory as fertile as the best parts
of Iowa and Illinois. With vodka pro
hibited and the war concluded Russia
will leap Into prosperity. I think tho
greatest opportunity lies In the es
tablishment of branch factories In Rus
sia, thus making American enterprise
Independent of foreign shipping."

South of the Somme, French

SHELLS PAVE WAY FOR

Continuous Roar of Guns As Foe's
Lines Are Battered.
By WILBUR S. FORREST.
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
NORTHERN FRANCE. July 20,-Every
foot of tho new German positions be
hind the lines captured by the British
north of the Sommo Is being carefully
and slowly drenched with a destructive
Aro of British high explosives In prepa
ration for a now attack.
Giant British shells are now dropping
upon German works from guns sta
tioned miles to tho rear.
British artillery pieces of large and
small caliber, acting In unison, are
systematically pounding the new Ger
man first lines.
The roar of guns is continuous and
resembles the heavy roll Qf thunder.
The Germans are replying only occat
slonally. Either they aro seriously outl
gunned or are saving their ammunition.
British aircraft, without molestation,
are directing tho fire of tho artillery.
Since the beginning of the Anglo
French push German aircraft have been
surprisingly absent.
Allied flyers and balloon observers
have been working In perfect security,
obtaining most valuable Information.
From a height a short distance In the
rear, I obtained an excellent "view of
Frtcourt, . Contalmatson, Mameta vil
lage, Mametx wood, Bazetln-Le-GrancT,
and othar positions recently conquered
by tho British.
Later our party traversed the valley
of the Somme and entered the ruins of
Frlcourt, once a German stronghold,
but stormed and enptured by the Brit
ish early In their great offensive.
Imagine a giant steam roller passing
over any American town of 2,000 in
habitants and you get an Idea of Frl
court today.
The little French town has been lit
erally wiped off the map,
German dug-outs and shell holes rep

piles of corpses.
