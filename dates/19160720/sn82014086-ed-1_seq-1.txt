PRAISE FOR PRUSSIANS
WHO H ELD OVILLERS
Starving, Against Overwhelming Odds,
They Held Out to End.
London, July 20, 2.35 a. m. The
Daily Telegraph's correspondent at
British headquarters in France praises
the bravery of the members of the
Third Prussian Guard who defended
Ovillors to the last against over
whelming odds.
"These men," says the correspond
ent, "had long been in a hopeless po
sition. They were starving bei:ause all
supplies had been cut off by the Brit
ish never-ending barrage. They had
no water, so they suffered from thirst.
They were living in a charnel house,
strewn with dead comrades and
wounded, delirious for lack of drink.
"Human nature could make no long
er resistance and at last the officers
raised the signal of surrender and
came over with lii men.
"The lighting had been savage. At
close grips in the broken earthworks
and deep cellars there had been no
sentiment. But now, when aii was
ended, the last of the German garrison
received the honors of war and none
of our soldiers deny them the respect
due to great courage."
BRITISH SOLDIERS
HAPPY THOUGH WOUNDED
Sir William Robertson, Ploasad With
Course of War, Breaks Silence,
London, July 1!, 2 p. m. "N'o, we
really are not worried by the course
of the war," said General Sir Willhim
Robertson, chief of 1 he Imperial Staff
at Army Head juirfers in an interview
with The Associated Press. "As to
the new offensive, a glance at the map
will tell the story of our progress, And
the happy oppression of our wounded
toldiers from the front reiterates the
spirit of the men. Ihi yriu notice that
all published photographs show them
smiling or laughing?"
The general himself fmiled genially
as he .spoke; nevertheless his manner
subtly conveyed hiw recognition of the
fact that he was breaking the silenco
he had maintained s,i rigidly fdnco. tho
beginning of the war. He l-eccived
the correspondent while seated at a
table in the military office within a
few feet of the wii e which permits
him, with the aid of maps and con
stantly arriving messages to direct the
moves of the conflict in France. The
question as to how long tho war wouM
last caused the general to shuko his
head and smile. "That is a question
touching human nature, which means
dealing with a dubious proposition,"
he said.

Contestants of Amos F. Eno's Will
Wanted to Carry Out His "Real In
tentions Mental Incompetence The
Claim of Heirs.
New York, July 19. Columbia Uni
versity loses approximately $4,000,000
under a verdict rendered here today
by a Jury, setting aside a will exe
cuted by the late Amos l". Eno short
ly before his death a year ago. The
amount represented Eno's reslduary
estary which, his relatives claimed, he
willed to Columbia while mentally in
competent. Bequests of $250,000 each to the Me
tropolitan Museum of Art, American
Museum of Natural History, and the
Society for Improving the Condition
of the Poor, as well $25,000 in cash
and books, prints and paintings to tho
New York Public Library will not be
affected, it was announced tonight,
the contestants having stipulated In
the event of a verdict favorable to
the mto protect those institutions.
It also was said that a bequest of
$1,800,000 to the General Society of
Mechanics and Tradesmen, which Eno
provided should be paid after all other
legacies had been settled, "out of the
rest, residue and remainedr" of the
estate should not be infected. In the
statement tha contestants said they
had decided to pay all charitable be
quests provided in the 1S15 will, ex
cept that to Columbia University, as
they desired to carry out what they
believed to have been Eno's "real in
tentions." His diary, they said, did
not mention Columbia university, but
did refer to the other institutions.
Amos R. E. Pinchot, his brother
Gifford Pinchot and other heirs under
a will executed on January 9, 1914, wil1
not offer this document for probate.
Under it they each would inherit
about $1,000,000 more than under the
rejected will of 1915.
The document which the contestants
declared his last will and testament
was made when Eho was conceded
of sound mind. In that will he dis
posed of what he thought was onlv
an $3,000,000 estate by making $7,
7'00,0oo in specific bequests to his rel
atives and about $300,000 to various
institutions, including the "residue" to
Columbia university, then thought to
be worth only about $10,000.
The will of 1915 also gave tlo resi
due to Columhi i univ ersity. P Vs es
tate consisted largely of real estate in
New York city and had grown to be
worth between $12,000,00 and $13,000,
000 and the residue to Columbia would
have amounted to about $4,000,000.

Baltimore, July 19. The German
merchant submarine Deutschland with
indications of being ready to sail at a
moment's notice was still lying at her
pier here at a late hour tonight.
Spars Down, Conning Tower Closed.
At 11 o'clock tonight the two spars
of the German merchant submarine
were taken down and the conning
tower closed. Close at hand lay the
tug Thomas F. Timmins with a full
head of steam up.
Numerous Launches in Neighborhood.
In the vicinity of the submarine
were numerous launches with agents
of the Eastern Forwarding company
and patrols aboard. These craft at
11.05 o'clock hailed a newspaper
launch and tried to induce the report
ers to leave.
"You are interfering with our plans,"
the watchman said.

MORE MYSTERY IN
BOSTON TRAGEDY.
Circumstances of Young Woman's
Death by Poisoning Questionable.
Boston, July 19. A new element of
mystery in connection with the inves
tigation of the shooting yesterday of
Dr. "Wilfred E. Harris, president of
the Massachusetts College of Oscteo
pathy, by Dr. Eldridge D. Atwood, one
of his former students, developed to
night as a result of the autopsy on
the body of Dr. Atwood's fiancee, Dr.
Celia Paine Adams, who died of
poisoning a short time before the at
tack on Dr. Harris.
In view of the alleged declaration
of Atwood that he shot Dr. Harris
because Miss Adams had told him that
Dr. Harris had wronged her, the au
topsy was looked upon as likely to
have an important bearing on the case.
In an informal statement tonight the
medical examiner. Dr. George B.
Magrath, who examined the body to
day announced merely that Miss
Adams "came to her death from the
effects of a poison, received by mouth,
the nature of which is at present un
determined.' The police bulletin issued last night
declares that the young woman died
from a narcotic poison self-administered.
Rnd it was believed that she httd
ended her life in a fit of despondency
after the supposed Interview with Dr.
Atwood in which the latter, according
to h's statement to the police, learned
of her alleged relations with Dr. Har
n'ce. The statement of Dr, Magrath
seemed to throw doubt upon the cor
rectness of this police theory by as
sert insr that no facta in his possession
showed "when, where or under what
circumFtancs" the poison waa re
ceived. Both Dr. Harris and Francis P.
Adams, father of Miss Adams, have
denied the charge of Dr, Atwood re
garding thi motive for the shooting.
"The relations exictlng between my
daughter and Dr. Harris were proper
In every way," said Mr. Adams to
night. The condition of Dr. Harris was re
ported as extremely critical at the
hospital tonight.
DU PONT COMPANY
CONSTANTLY ON GUARD
Fear of Explosions Caused by Parti
sans of Foreign Governments.
Wilmington, Del., July 19. Some of
the secrets in connection with the fil
ling of orders for the entente allies by
the Du Pont Powder company were
told on the witness Btand today by
Colonel Edmund ( '. Iiuckner, a vice
president hit1 It-.-'' of the militia de
)ntment of the company, In the suit
over the possesion oi aoout $56,000,
000 worth of the corporation's stock.
Colonel Buckner said at times there
was reason to fear the company
would not be able to complete its for
eign contracts.
Overzealous partisans of foreign
governments in the employ of the
company, he testified, put nails in
powder boxes, also scraps of offal and
various things that would cause the
product to deteriorate and be reject
ed by the purchasers. Also, he said,
there was fear that one or more great
explosions would destroy the cplants,
already overworked. While there were
minor explosions, none of them, he
testified, could be traced to the work
of enemies but the company was con
stantly on guard.
The suit was brought by stockhold
ers against Pierre S. duPont and cer
tain directors who are accused of hav
ing purchased the common duPont
stock for their own personal benefit
instead of for the benefit of the com
pany. Fourteen million dollars was
paid for the stock which because of
war contracts increased in value to
$56,000,000.

All shore leave for the crew of tho
Deutschland was stopped tonight. Ac
cording to stories told by friends of
some of the submarine's seamen, the
latter have expressed deepest anxit
ty over the possibility of their falling
victims to the allied cruisers re

from disabled engines through being
caught in the nets wnlch they be

Fear of Allies' Nets.
"Entangled in these, the submarine
cannot escape," a friend of the men
was quoted as saying tonight. "Her
engines will be crippled and it will be
a slow and agonizing death to all on
board When the engines stop the
lights will go out and the air will
sto. That is what the men fear.
They talked of it continually while
with me at night, and they ask every
one to pray for them."
Thi ssame man said the Deutsch

Bremen might meet the fate they had
pictured as a possibility to them
