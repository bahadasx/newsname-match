NAVAL COLLIER SUNK.
AH of Crew and Passengers Were
Saved.
Charleston, July 15.?The large
naval collier Hector, carrying
sixty marines in addition to her
crew of seventy men and twelve
officers, sank off Charleston yesterday,
according to a report made here
by Capt. F. R. Hunt, of the tug Vigilant,
which tried to go to the Hector's
assistance. The steamer Alamo
had been standing by the collier, having
responded to her calls when the
collier was disabled some sixty miles
off here in Thursday night's hurricane.
Capt. Hunt did not get within

UiVl V tllUU VAAA W MAA'W W ...W
tor and no wireless report could be
obtained from the Alamo. It was
not known here whether the Alamo
had^Seen able to take off the 142
persons aboard the Hector.
From the steamer Arapahoe, which
arrived here yesterday afternoon,
came the report that the torpedo boat
destroyer No. 25 was being towed in
by a tug. It was not known what
damage had been done to the destroyer.
With Marines From Port Royal.
The Hector left Port Royal for
Santo Domingo carrying the marines
who were recruits for United States
forces in Santo Domingo and Cuba.
She attempted to put into port here
when the storm disabled her, but, according
to Capt. Hunt, was unable
to get nearer than to within about
nine and a half miles from the
Charleston lightship before she sank.
Capt. Hunt said part of the collier's
superstructure remained above water.
The naval collier Hector was built
at Sparrows Point, Md., in 1908, and
was one of the first of the new type
of naval fuel ships to be completed.
She carried a crew of 73 men.
The vessel was of 11,200 tons displacement,
383.9 feet long, 52.5 feet
broad and had a draft of 24.5 feet.
Her speed was 12 knots an hour and
her carrying capacity 8,128 tons of
coal.
Went Down in Shallow Water.
The Hector went down in shallow
water and was breaking up, according
to a /message sent to the navy
department from Charleston. The
message added that the collier was
lowering her small boats, but did not
say whether or not the 142 persons
aboard had reached rescue ships in
safety. The message was filed at
Charleston at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon.
The Hector was commanded by
Capt. G. F. Newell, and besides a
crew of seventy men and twelve officers,
carried sixty marines, who
had been taken on from the Port
Royal naval training station and
who were to join commands in Santo
Domingo. Up
to late last night all efforts of
the naval wireless to ascertain
whether there had been loss of life in
the sinking of the Hector had been
unavailing. A series of calls for help
from the collier, stopping abruptly
at 4 p. m., gave rise to grave fears
for the safety of those aboard, but

possibility that they had escaped.
It was reported last night that the
destroyer Terry, in tow of the tug
Relief, was off the Charleston lightship
and would not enter port until
today.
Later?All of the crew and the
marines on the Hector were rescued,
and safely landed.
Held to Be Merchantman.
Washington, July 15.?The State
department formally ruled today that
the German submarine Deutschland
is a merchant vessel and entitled to
treatment as such.
"In view of the facts in this particular
case," said Mr. Polk," there is
no reason why the Deutschland
should be considered a war vessel."

GIRL SAVES SISTER'S LIFE.
Miss Ina Wood the Heroine of a Near
Tragedy in the Salnda River.
T /* ????/\*\ ? TIIITT *f C Til hfo TTA
Juaui cuB, ?j u.ij x t/. x xio uiavc,
quick action of Miss Ina Wood saved
her younger sister, Miss Cornelia
Wood, from almost certain death by
drowning in Saluda river, not far
above Ware Shoals, last Wednesday
afternoon, according to information
brought from that section of the
county.
It seems that a party of young
women, including the Misses Wood,
daughters of Mrs. James E. Wood,
of the Harmony church neighborhood,
this county, were spending the
afternoon on the banks of the river
enjoying a quiet picnic. Arriving at
the "Big Rock," a noted and interesting
point on the Saluda, Miss Cornelia
Wood, with some of her companions,
ventured out on the rock to the water's
edge. Suddenly Miss Wood lost
t- - Vil TTI /I i Y\ ACQ
tier luuimg, yi uuauy n um
and fell into the deep current, at the
upper end of the rock. Being unable
to swim she sank at once. All of her
companions were horror-stricken,
save her elder sister, who quickly
threw aside her big sun hat, plunged
into the rushing water and made her
way to her sister, then apparently
unconscious, just as she was being
swept out into the main current ot
the river.
Throwing her arms about the limp
form of the drowning girl, both were
carried down stream until they came
near enough to the shore to cling to |
projecting bushes. Here both, assisted
-by other members of the par- j
ty, were brought safely ashore, and
after some heroic work, Miss Cornelia
was revived and taken home.
The cool, heroic performance of Miss
I Ina Wood no doubt averted a tragei

dv, and her bravery is commented
upon on all sides.
The average life of the ordinary

MAX-EATING SHARKS.
Hunters Patrolling New York and
New Jersey Beaches for Them.
New York, July 13.?Armed shark
hunters in motor boats patrolled the
New York and New Jersey coasts today,
while others lined the beaches
in a concerted effort to exterminate
the man-eaters which have moved
north from their customary haunts,
apparently in large numbers. The
village authorities of Matawan, N. J.,
offered a reward of $100 for every
shark brought in dead or alive.
The belief that a single shark was
responsible for the killing of four
swimmers in New Jersey waters
within the past two weeks, two of
them yesterday in Matawan Creek, a
shallow inlet sixteen miles from the
open sea, has been dispelled by persons
who actually. have seen a half
dozen or more of the monsters.
*
One theory is that sharks which
formerly fed on refuse thrown overboard
from the many ocean ships
that plied before the war began now
have become ravenous. Even those
not ordinarily classed as man-eaters,
it is said have been driven by starvax

Huge Fishes Seen.
Three of the huge fishes were seen
to-day in Matawan Creek and are believed
to be bottled up there. Nets
have been stretched under a bridge
about a mile and a half from the
mouth of the inlet to prevent egress.
A British sloop arriving from Bermuda
was reported tonight to have
killed a score of sharks during the
voyage, one of them off the New Jersey
coast.
Terror has seized the multitudes
who have bathed at beaches along
the New York and New Jersey coasts
and comparatively few persons now
venture into the water. At Ashbury
Park and other New Jersey resorts
wire nets have been strung around
the bathing areas.
Dl\ George G. Reynolds, or Mata-|
wan, who attended Stanley Fisher,
who. was so seriously mangled in a
battle with a shark yesterday that he
diejl a few hours later, performed an
autopsy on. Fisher's body today. He
declared that the flesh torn by the
man-%ater's teeth was impregnated
with a peculiar poisonous Jlquid,
which seemed to have a deadening
effect on the nerves and muscles.
This probably explained, he said,
why Fisher apparently had little
sensation of pain when the shark
took off his leg.
Devoured by Shark.
Little hope is entertained for the
recovery of the body of 2-year-old
Lester Stillwell, the other victim of
the Matawan Creek tragedy. It is
believed that he was devoured by
the shark, as persistent dragging of
the inlet and dynamiting of the water
have failed to bring up the body.
Many conflicting reports were received
here during the day from various
points along the New York and
New Jersey coasts regarding the killing
of sharks, but only one appears
to have any foundation in fact. This
was the news brought in by Anthony
Lundy, captain of a fishing smack,
who said his party of New York
~ ' 1 ^ J A. ^ A
nsnermen naa ciuulkju. iu ucam a,
nine-foot shark, weighing 45 Q.
pounds, while cruising yesterday off
Elberson, N. J.
A fisherman reported tonight that
he had vainly tried to kill with an
oar a seven-foot shark which became
entangled in his nets. He said the
fish tried to strike his boat.
Part of Cargo to Anderson.
Anderson, July 15.-^The Brogon
cotton mills, manufacturers of print
cloth goods, are assured by the
American representatives of the Geri
man Hvostnff ma nil farturers that the I
mills will receive a share of the cargo
of 750 tons of dyestuff that arrived
on the German submarine
Deutschland in Baltimore a few days
ago. President Gossett said today
that he had made applications for a
part of the cargo and that the American
representatives stated that it
would be distributed among their
customers on the basis of past sales.
Mr. Gossett says the American representatives
have not been informed
as to the character of t?e dyestuff on
board the submarine, but he is hoping
that it is indantrine, because the
mills are short in the supply of this
particular stuff. Indantrine is an
important ingredient in manufacturing
fast colors, colors that are washable.
The Brogon Mills are one of
the two mills in the South that manufacture
this kind of print cloth

DAMAGE BY WIND AND RAIN
UNPRECEDENTED HEAVY RAIN-1
FALL IN CAROLINAS.
m
Fourteen Inches of Rain Fell at Florence.?Crops
Damaged.?Sev*
eral Cities Inundated.
Columbia, July 16.?Unprecedentedly
heavy rains, whijch have trans
formed creeks into rivers, rivers into
torrents and lowlands into lakes, followed
the track of the coast hurricane
which swept over South Carolina,
starting at Charleston Thursday
night. The Pee Dee section,
which seems to have felt the chief
force of the disturbance, reports
crops flattened, bridges swept away
by raging streams, roads all but impassable
on account of debris and
railway communication badly crippled.
Thus far there have been no reports
of loss of life, but it is possible
that some lives have been lost in the
swollen streams. The rising of the
river and creeks now becomes the
most serious factor in the situation.
The weather bureau has announced
that warnings for the Santee, Wateree,
Catawba and Saluda rivers
stand, and reports from points on
these streams indicate that the waters
will be very high indeed.
The precipitation was the heaviest
ever seen in some sections. Florence
had nearly 14 inches in 36
hours and Kingstree had more than
ten. In Kingstree the drniaage canal
through the centre of the town left
its banks and caused much damage
to property.
Estimates of crop damage vary.
Some reports have it that especially
in the Pee Dee section the loss has
been terrible, while others indicate
that first accounts were pessimistic.
Yesterday's reports showed that as
the storm swept inland it brought its
toll of damage and inconvenience to
the Piedmont, where rising streams
embarrassed railway communication
and damaged crops and bridges.
Floods in North Carolina.
Asheville, N. C., July 16.?Taking
a toll of five human lives, with a
property loss estimated from $6,000,000
to $10,000,000, and with hundreds
of people rendered homeless
by the destruction of more than one
hundred houses, the worst flood in
the history of the State swept the
river section of Asheville and the
French Broad Valley early this
morning, and at 8 o'clock tonight
the waters of the Swanannoa and
French Broad rivers were fifteen feet
above their banks, although believed
to be receding. Reports from towns
in the French Broad Valley, covering
a territory from the lake Toxaway
section to Hot Springs, near the
Tennessee line, put the property
losses at nearly $10,000,000. Reports
from these sections are difficult
to obtain owing to the interruption
of telegraph and telephone communication,
lines being down everywhere.
At 1 o'clock today the Western Union
Telegraph company succeeded in
looping up a telephone wire to Atlanta,
thus getting the only line of
communication to the outside world
at that time.
Georgetown Hard Hit.
Conway, July 16.?Georgetown
was in the vortex of the tropical hurricane
which swept the Carolina
coast Thursday and Friday, according
to Capt. James H. Porter, who
brought a party from that city today
in the Atlantic Coast Corpora
tion's tug, W. Hj Andrews, to communicate
with the president of the
corporation, R. J. Clifford, Georgetown
having had no communication
with the "outside world since Thursday
night. Capt. Porter said that he
would not begin to estimate the damage
wrought to the city and to crops
in the county, but that the loss must
have been exceedingly great.
During the storm the wharves and
stores along the water front were
flooded with water several feet deep,
while the Seaboard railway's tracks
were washed away around Georgetown
for three or four mile^ There
have been no trains in or out of the
city since the storm. Telegraph and
telephone communication with the
outside world has been cut off since
,Friday morning. Parties had been
cont nut in fl.nntmohilfts in everv di
rection, but all returned after having
travelled four or five miles.
The damage done the Atlantic
Coast Lumber Corporation's plants is
estimated by Capt. Porter at $50,000.
The whole town, he said, presented
a mass of wires, upturned trees and
wrecked buildings. A number of
tugs and other craft were sunk,
among them being the yacht Palmetto,
owned by E. W. Kaminski, and a
number of gasoline launches owned
by J. E. McQuade, of the Georgetown
canning factory. As many
'J
more craft were washed ashore. The
Winyah Lumber company's plant
was practically a total loss. The
smokestacks of all the mills were
blown away by the high wind. The
power house was almost a total J
wreck and wires were blown helter
skelter about the streets and wound
about the trees. It will be many
days before it can be repaired.
The Scurry garage was demolished
by a large tree falling on the
building. The high school building
was unroofed and considerable damage
wrought inside by the beating
rains and terrific winds. ^
"There are a great many other
buildings that suffered," said Gapt.
Porter, "of which I know nothing,
but merely observed those already
mentioned. The crops in the county
must be practically a total loss, judging
from the gardens in the town;
they were literally torn to shreds and
levelled to the ground."
The buildings on the island did
not suffer correspondingly as those
in town, said Capt. Porter. No lives
were lost.
Just as soon as T. C. Clifford, who
has sent several messages to his
father, R. J. Clifford, president of
the Atlantic Coast Corporation,
gains fin answer to his telegrams, the
party will return to Georgetown.
Conway is still cut off from the
rest of the State so far as mails are
concerned, none having been received
here since Thursday.
Damage in Charleston. - \i
Charleston, July 15.?The loss of
the naval collier Hector off the
Charleston lightship, was by far the
worst phase of the damage done by
fV>?k Vi 11 vHnq wVHaVi struck this see
tion Thursday afternoon. i
The torpedo boat destroyer, Terry,
according to the Clyde Line steamship
Arapahoe, had weathered the
storm and was heading in for this
port, being towed by a large tug,,
when the liner sighted her.
Only one life was lost as a result
of the hurricane here. An unknown
negro man walked into a dangling,
electric wire and was electrocuted.
Several people are reported to have'.
suffered minor injuries, due to slipping
on the debris-strewn pave- *
ments.
Sullivan's island and the Isle of
Palms escaped damage. Neither island
was under water and the wind
does not seem to have been any
heavier than it was in Charleston.
Crops in the vicinity of Charleston
are reported to have been badly
damaged by the heavy winds. Corn
and cotton are stated to have been
laid low. Reports from Y^ge's island
were more favorable.
In Dorchester county, about fifty
miles from Charleston, a large pine
tree fell between two young chil
*
dren. Neither was harmed, although
the brush barely missed them.
The telephone company reports
between 1,500 and 2,000 telephones
out of order. For ten hours y.esterday
Charleston was out of telegraphic
communication with the outside
world. .
The highest wind velocity recorded
by the local office of the weather
bureau was sixty-two miles an hour,
at 2 o'clock Thursday afternoon. For
a time yesterday morning it blew at
the rate of forty-five miles an hour,
while about 7:30 o'clock last night
the velocity was stated to be thirtyfive
miles.

Chief Louis Behrens has stationed
lookouts in the steeple of St.
Michael's church and in the dome of
the Charleston Orphan House, and
the police are cooperating.
Water had subsided early yesterday
in the lower sections of the city.
With the backing out of the tide water,
the drains were able to carry off
all the surface water.
Much of the water covering the
Battery Boulevard was caused by the
inability of drains in Ashley avenue
and Rutledge avenue to carry off the
rain, though a considerable quantity
was poured over the long sea wall.
The navy yard escaped with slight
damage. Owing to the lack of street
car service there was a great shortage
of labor at the yard yesterday.
Plants along the "Neck" are stated
to have sustained only inconsequential
damage.
The Seaboard Air Line and the Atlantic
Coast Line railroads had serious
washouts near Goose creek yesterday.
The train from New York,
due at 11:30 o'clock last night, was
very late. A rainfall of cloudburst
proportions occurred in that vicinity.
