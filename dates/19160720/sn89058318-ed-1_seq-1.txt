CONTENMENT
Happy the maii that, when his day is done,
- Lies down to sleep with nothing to regret
. The battle he has fought may not be won,
The fame he sought be just as fleeting yet;
) Folding at last his hands upon his breast,
He sinks into the last eternal rest,
Breathing these only words : lI am content, "
But happier he that, while his blood is warm, ,
Sees hope and friendships dead about him lie,
' . . Bares his brave breast ' to envy 's bitter storm,
Nor shuts the poison barbs of calumny;
And, 'mid it all, siands sturdy and elate,
Girt only in'the armor God hath meant
, For him who 'neath the buffetings of fate
,0an say to God and man : ."I am content."

Our Judge and At
torney General
Judge Frank Lynch and Attor
neVrGeneral MoKenzie, have
made many friendsBiuce they be
gan holding court here. They
have proved themselves to be in
dustrious p and painstaking.
Courts officers are human beings
and therefore not infallible, but
a conscientious effort, such as
these men appear to be making
to enforce the law for the pro
tection of people ; and property,
which -ia the only safeguard to
society, is commendable. Any
otlier policy" would result in the
nullification pf law and the
destruction of society and all in
stitutions which have in view
the educational and religious de
velopment of our people. These
facts are attested by the fact
that the members of the bar,
throughout this judical circuit,
men: who deal direct with the
court, and in a better position to
judge of their fitness, have unan
imously endorsed Judge. Lynch
and General McKenzie for re
election. This of1 itself is a badge
of honor that any officer judicial
or otherwise, ought to- be'' proud
of. ; ;. .
