If Charles Estes is tellins the truth
In the alleged Kansas City confession,
wherein he declared he and three
other Topekans robbed the St. Marys
state bank the night of July 4, local
officers have been underestimating
Estes for a good many years. They
thought they knew him like a book
and to a man they express doubt that
he has sufficient nerve or ability to
participate in an affair like the rob
berv cf the bank.
That Estes had confessed to the
crime and implicated his sister. Haze
and two men. Chester McLain and a
mvsterious "Bill" was telephoned to
the Topeka police station just after
noon Wednesday by Kansas City de
tectives. The chief points in the con
fession were related to Robert M.ler,
Topeka detective, with Harvey I ar
sons, chief, standing near. Mrtr
made notations as the conversation
went along. ,i t,a-i
As soon as Parsons and Miler ha '
an opportunity to talk alone they be
gan to doubt the truth of Estes's al
leged statements. They did not ques
tion the statement that he had made
a confession but they did and still do
doubt that he was telling the whole
truth and nothing but the truth
They believe Estes knows something
ZZt the robbery of the St. Marys
bank but they do not believe he has
sufficient nerve to stand out on i the
street and be shot at nor to help ens -i.ter
a plan that might bring about
such a situation.
It Is Not 1-lke Him.
"Estes is a coward," said Chief Par
sons. "The more 1 think about our
experiences with. him the more I doubt
hU story. He has nerve enough to
kill dogs, beat horses and whip his
wife, but 1 am satisfied he would not
take such chances as the men at St.
Marys took."
L. 1,. Kiene, sheriff, also knows
Estes. He is of the same opinion as
Pardons.
"The fellows who pulled off that
bank robbery were crooks, all right,"
he said, "but they were also men. They
had nerve and initiative. I don't be
lieve Estes has either."
Following the information from
Kansas t'tty. Parsons sent men out on
a search for Hazel Estes, Chester Mc
Lain and the mysterious "Kill."
Hazel Estes was found at the home
of her parents on Central avenue,
north of the Soldier creek bridge. She
was taken to the police station and
put through a series of questions. She
denied any knowledge of the bank rob
bery, denied she knew anything about
Charles Estes. She furnished an alibi
which has since been investigated by
officers and found to hold water.
Hit Alibi.
The Estes girl said that the evening
of July 4, the night the St. Marys
bank was robbed, she left for Kansas
City with George Lauman in a Ford
car. She said she did not know it
at the time, but has learned since that
the car had been stolen from J. J.
King in North Topeka July 3. They
reached Kansas City the morning of
July 5 and Lauman was arrested upon
orders from Topeka July 6. He was
brought back by Sheriff Kiene and is
now in the county jail. He has
vouched for all the girl told and in
vestigations conducted on the outside
verify the stories tola by both.
If the story told by Hazel Estes is
true, and the officers believe it is,
the confession of Charles Estes is
faulty. Hazel Estes was released by
the police Wednesday night.
Dispatches from Kansas City say
that Estes, accompanied by local de
tectives, left Kansas City late Wednes
day night for some point in Kansas.
City and county officials have been
expecting the party in Topeka, but
they have not stopped here. Inquiries
made at St. Marys this afternoon
brought the information that neither
Estes nor his guards have been there.
There is a reward of $1,000 for the
arrest and conviction of the men who
robbed the St. Marys State bank, and
local officials doubt that the Kansas
City detectives will turn Estes over
to Topeka or Shawnee county officers
at present. Estes is wanted here on a
minor charge that of cruelty to ani
mals. Last spring Kilmaurs King
swore to a complaint upon which a
warrant was issued charging that of
fense. 120 IN SHADE THERE

The convention cheered and dele

carried him to the platform. Mrs.

picked her up too and carried her up

Coffin's contribution is believed the

BY WILBUR S. FOREST.
With the British Army in Northern
France, July 20. Every foot of the
new German positions behind the lines
captured by the British north of the
Somme is being carefully and slowly
drenched with a destructive fire of
British high explosives in preparation
for a new attack. Giant British shells
style of a convention was to see some
"steam rollering" today. The faction
backing Hanly for president had con
trol and planned to nominate him,
adopt a platform and adjourn to
night, one day in advance of schedule
time. To check the steam roller, Wil
liam Sulzer, formr governor of New
York, the other candidate for presi
dent, was expected here today to at
tempt a stampede for himself. Out
of a mass of suggestions placed before
them by enthusiasts on almost every
subject under the sun, the convention's
platform committee early today had
fairly well worked out its principal
planks.
The Susan B. Anthony suffrage
amendment, an eight hour day for
workingmen, several other "social jus
tice" planks, a program of prepared
ness for peace only, government own
ership of armor plants and support of
various farmers' movements were the
principal clauses decided, upon to Aid
national prohibition.
are now dropping upon German works
from guns stationed miles to the rear.
British artillery pieces of large and
small caliber, acting in unison, are
systematically pounding the German
first lines.
The roar of guns is continuous and
resembles the heavy roll of thunder.
The Germans are replying only occa
sionally. Either they are seriously
out-gunned, or are saving their ammu
nition. German Air Craft Scarce.
British air craft, without molesta
tion, are directing the fire of the ar
tillery. Since the beginning of the
Anglo-French push German air craft
have been surprisingly absent. Al
lied flyers and balloon observers have
been working in perfect security, ob
taining most valuable information.
From a height a short distance in the
rear, I obtained an excellent view of
Fricourt, Contalmaison, Mametz vil
lage, Mametz Wood, Bazentln-le-Grand
and other positions recently
conquered by the British. Later our
party traversed the valley of the
Somme and entered the ruins of Fri
court, once a German stronghold, but
stormed and captured by the British
early in their great offensive.
Imagine a giant steam roller pass
ing over an American town of 2,000
inhabitants and you get an idea of
Fricourt today. The little French
town has been literally wiped 3tt the
map. German dugouts and shellholes
represent the spike holes of a huge
steam roller. The rest of the town is
flattened in debris. Here and there
from the hole of a battered-in Ger
man dugout comes a sickening stench
that tells of piles of corpses.
Village Is Catacombed.
Tne scene at Fricourt is typical of
that in any of the other villages blot
ted out by high explosives. High Brit
ish officers say that the purpose of the
British offensive is not speed, but to
recover by slow, steady pushes every
yard of invaded French and Belgian
territory at a minimum expense of
human blood and by a heavy use of
powerful explosives of which there Is
a big Bupply on hand
Fighting must go on below as well
as above ground. The Germans have
catacombed all villages to escape shell
fire. At Babantin-le-Grand, for in
stance, the under-ground caverns shel
tered 15.000 men. The entire Anglo
French front on the Somme offensive
are. as far as the eye can see, literally
swarmed with men and material.

Such a deplorable situation could not

MOHLER PRODUCES ARGUMENT
4
Farms in Other States More
Heavily Mortgaged.
Secretary of Agriculture Sees
Opportunity for Topeka.
Further arguments for locating the
Farm Loan bank in Topeka were ad
vanced this morning by J. C. Mohler,
secretary of the state board of agri
culture, to members of the Topeka
Commercial club. Mr. Mohler pre
sented figures showing that the farms
of Iowa and Missouri are more fully
developed and more heavily mortgaged
than those in Nebraska. Oklahoma,
Kansas and Arkansas, other states to
be included in this district, it is be
lieved. In fact, the farm mortgages in Iowa
exceed those of any state in the union.
Missouri is next in the number or
mortgages in the contemplated land
loan district for this section. Then
Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Ar
kansas.
'This makes one of the best argu
ments I can conceive for locating the
bank in ' Topeka," said Mr. Mohler.
"In Missouri and Iowa, the farm land
has been purchased in small farms
that are already mortgaged by the
owners. But in Nebraska, Oklahoma-
Arkansas and Kansas, they have hard
ly begun to do intensive farming, the
ultimate method of agriculture to be
employed ir. this country.
"Purchasing of small farms by
young men through the mortgage sys
tem, will increase steadily from year
to year in these four states. Where
would one find a more ideal location
than Topeka for the establishment of
this bank, which deals almost solely
in farm mortgages? It is almost in
the center of this great, partly culti
vated region including Kansas, Okla
homa, Arkansas and Nebraska."
S. 15. Cobb, chairman of the farm
loan bank committee, today opened
correspondence .with . Kansas City
banks requesting them to back up
Topeka in its fight for the bank. lu
view of the fact that .Topeka worked
for the establishment of the federal
reserve bank at Kansas City It is be
lieved Kansas City will reciprocate in
the fight for the land loan bank In
Topeka.
A consultation will be held tomor
row between members of the Commer
cial club and Charles E. Lobdell of
Great Bend. Mr. Lobdell is a candi
date for membership on the federal
board and understands the new bill
more thoroughly, probably, than any
man in Kansas.
IN A SAD PLIGHT
Battery A Sent to Border With
out Equipment.
Authentic information has been re
ceived here that Battery A, Topeka's
contribution to the army of national
guards now encamped on the Mexican
border, was sent awe.y without full
equipment and that the members of
the battery as a result have been suf
fering untold hardships ever since
arrival at Eagle Pass.
No, they are not lacking in food
supplies, clothing or medical neces
sities, but there is not a piece of base
ball paraphernalia In the whole bat
tery and as a result the whole battery
is almost starved for a taste of the
national pastime.
The first intimation that Batterv A
was unprepared along this line was
given in a letter received by Robert
Fullerton from W. P. MacLean, first
lieutenant of the battery, who took It
upon himself to make known the de
privations his men are suffering. The
eiter is as ionows:
Robert Fullerton, Topeka, Kan.
Dear Kooert: The boys of the bat
tery want to organize a baseball team
here and are ready to clean up any
thing in camp, but they are nhort on
equipment and, as the pay of a soldier
is not princely, the boys cannot af
ford to put out much in that line.
If you have anything at .ill around
there in the way of balls, gloves, mitts,
bats, etc., that you can spare, the
whole battery would certainly appre
ciate it and I would consider it a per
sonal favor to be remembered a life
time. We shall be glad to send you the
results ot our games.
Very sincerely yours.
