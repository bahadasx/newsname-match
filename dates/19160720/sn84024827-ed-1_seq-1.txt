(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 19 Prelimi
nary negotiations between Acting
Secretary Polk and Eliseo Arredondo,
Mexican. Ambassador-designate, for
peaceful settlement of border differ
ences proceeded so well today that
a formal announcement "will be made
very soon" as to the course to be fol
Jowed, the officials predicted. The
conferees met twice today. Later Mr.
Arfledondo telegraphed a report to
his government and Mr. Polk pre
pared a similar report for Secretary
Lansing, now on his vacation, and
probably will talk over the situation
with President Wilson tomorrow. Mr.
Lansing is being fully advised of ev
ery step in the negotiations.
Commission Plan Passes
Henry P. Fletcher, ambassador-designate
to Mexico, was present at both
conferences, interpreting whenever it
was necessary, to insure a clear un
derstanding. It is understood the dis
cussion dealt principally with the
powts to be coufem-d upon a Joint
commission should that plan of set
tlement be followed.
Formality Alone Needed
So far no definite agreement on the
course to be pursued has been reach
ed, but today's developments indicat
ed that only final word from General
Carranza and President Wilson was
lacking.
It was states1 officially that the
American commissioners had not been
selected. Officials said also that Mr.
Fletcher would not head the Ameri
can membership, as had been report
ed, because it might impair his dip
lomatic usefulness.
Formal Recognition
It is understood Mr. Fletcher will
go to his post in Mexico City soon
after Secretary Lansing returns from
his vacation, about August 1, provided
the favorable turn of events beyond
the border continues. At the same
time, Mr. Arredondo will be formally
received by President Wilson as am
bassador from the republic of Mex
ico and formal diplomatic relations be
restored.
Withdrawal Sidestepped
. State department officials said to
day they ad no information as to
when General Pershing's troops would
be withdrawn from Mexico, indicating
that this was a military question en

ment. saying that General Gonzales had
conferred with him as to reports of
the seizure of the Hearst ranch in
Chihuahua and then had proceeded
to investigate the case, was viewed
here as further evidence of the more
conciliatory attitude of all Carranza
officials. General Pershing had called
attention to this change previously,
saying that the general opinion of
those Mexicans with whom he came
in contact was that a peaceful adjust
ment of all differences would be
found. (
Embargo Leaking
The war department announced to
day a further relaxation of the unof
ficial embargo imposed at the border
when the Mexican emergency became
acute. Coal, coke and gasoline for in
dustrial purposes and household
goods now will be permitted to pass
into Mexico, the announcement said,
in reasonable quantities,

The Senator
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 19. An at
tack by Senator Lafolette on the gen
eral preparednes program as the pro
duct of agitatin by moneyed tnter-
: ests, aided by the metropolitan press,
prevented final vote in the Senate to
iday on the naval bill. The Wisconsin
senator had not completed his speech
when the Senate adjourned tonight
and did not indicate how long he
planned to continue. The general be
lief, however, was that a vote w'juld
be reached tomorrow.
Penrose Pets Ignored.
Most of today was taken up with
an unsuccessful fight by Senators
Oliver and Peni'jse on the action of
the bill providing for an $11,000,000;
government armor plate plant. By a :
vote of 51 to 17 the Senate defeated
a motion to strike out the seet.Vm and
then voted down, 49 to 16, the Oliver
amendment to refer the armor con
troversy I'j the federal trade commis
sion for settlement. Senator Lafol-
ette contended vigorously that neither j
conditions confirming the nation nor
the testimony given before the con-1
gress ional naval committee warranted :
the proposed navy increases.
A total bf $844,000,000 " is the load
that goes to bend the backs of the
American people."
Sees Only Profits.
"WTiy is that to be done. If it is
necessary now, why was it not neces
sary four years af,'J. You knew then
the naval and military strength of all
the foreign countries, but then the "in
terest had not been appealed to. Beth
lehem Steel at 40 was not Bethlehem
Steel at 810. The interests behind
this preparedness plan do not fear
Germany or England. The plan mere
ly fills into the imperialistic schemes."
Forced to Parade?
The senator charged that men had
been forced into preparedness parades

BALTIMORE. July 19. At 11 o'
clock tonight the two spars of the
German merchant submarine were
taken down and the conning tower
closed. Close at hand lay the tug
Thomas K. Timmons with a full head
of steam up.
In the vicinity of the submarine
were numerous launches with agents
of the Eastern Forwarding company
patrols aboard. At 11:05 o'clock
these craft hailed a newspaper launch
and tried to induce the rrporters In
leave. "You're interfering with our
plans," the watchman said.
To all appearances the Deutschland
was ready to leave at any time. Her
crew and master were aboard.
Among the late events that tended
to Confirm this belief was the stowing
of moe than 40 tons of fuel oil on the
submersible late this afternoon. The j
stevedores who have been working
day and night for nearly a week put
ting aboard the return cargo of rub
ber and nickel were discharged t.iis
afternoon, to hwours before the usual
time for the day shift to quit.

Sensation Expected To Fol

Cargo Taken On By Ger
man Submarine
(By Review Leased Wire.)
OTTAWA, Ont., July 19. The ques
tion as to who supplied the nickel
which is such a great part of the
Deutschlands cargo on her return to
Germany, became of added interest
here today with the announcement
that an official statement would be
issued within a few days on the whole
policy of the British and Canadian
government in respect to the sale of
the metal.
Officials challenge the statement
of George P. Graham, former minister
of railways, in the Laurier cabinet,
that Canadian nickel sold to American
firms on condition that it shall not
reach England's enemies, can be ob
tained without difficulty in the open
market in the I'nited States. -
It is claimed that the United States
produces 240.000 tons of nickel an
nually and that all Canadian nickel
exported to the United States has
been accounted for by the Interna
tional Nickel company, the purchaser
of virtually all of it. No change of
policy is foreshadowed.
IS
OUT TO SEA
All shore leave for the crew of the
Deutschland was stopped tonight. Ac
cording to stories told by friends of
some of the submarine's senmcn. the
latter have expressed deepest anxiety
over the possibility of their falling
victim to the allied cruisers report
ed to be awniliw; the submersible off
the capes not from cannon, but from
disabled engines t.'i rough being caught
in nets which they believe will be
stretched for them.
"Entangled in these tlie submarine
cannot escape," a friend of the men
was quoted as saying tonight "Her
engines will he crippled and it wi'l be
a slow and agoniring death to all in
board. When I lie engines stop, the
lights will go out and the air will slon.
That is what the men fear. Tliey talk
of it continually w'lile with me at
night and they ask everyone to priy
for them."
Th's bame man says the peutsrh
land's crew expressed fears that the
Bremen might meet the fate that they
had pictured hs a possibility to themselves.
