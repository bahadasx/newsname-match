jft PARADISE WITH SAINT
PETER
Everywhere Was Hapiness With But One
Exception and'Note the Exception
Plsase A Dream of Con-
tentment.
Monday night soon after hearing
a hot-air artist ais:uss tne proposed
bond issue, the editor wendecLhis way
home and pretty soon fell asleep,
and dreamed and dreamed again.
And it was one of those visions
or phantasies of the night that I
must inform you, as it may be (who
Knows?) another bit of evidence in
corroboration of our belief in what
happens after the experience we
calf death.
It seemed that my course on
Earth was done. I lay me down
and slept with my fathers. When
the little circle that had followed
my cold form to the cemetery had
departed, of this I seemed wholly
conscious, a strong hand clasped
mine ana we iusc uuuugu cmiu
and clay and sped upwards towards
the great central sun.
At last we approached the pearly
gaies and was aware that I stood
tiyon the threshold of Paradise! I
know not what pleas my Guide was
forced to make on my behalf; I
know not what forgotten deed of
kindness won me entrance; I only
know the gates swung open and we
were wafted in, into the presence of
St. Peter.
When I had been welcomed, in
troduced and made to feel at home
the genial Saint (St. Peter must
have ben a charter member of the
Greeters' Club!) bade me make his
office my headquarters "till I got
squared round a bit, don't you,
know!' and I sallied forth to view
Paradise. "If you need any direc
tions," said St. Peter as he shook
my hand, "oi want to ask any ques
t.ons about anything, don't hesitate
to come back here. I'm never too
b :sy to answer questions!"
To describe the beauties of Para
dise is beyond anyvjanguage. .Words
fail, ideas ereaare weak,e bright
est colors I can write of ithis won
derful paradise are drab and cold
when compared to the shimmering,
exalting, palpitating glory of sky
imagination must transcend all mor
tal boundaries must see a heaven
of harmony, birds singing, children
Ijughing, sun shining, flowers
bkoming, the air filled with fra
prance and with melody! Every
where were happy groups, spirit
forms of surpassing loveliness, all
happy, ail busy, their faces wreath
ed in smiles, their arms entwined,
Love pervading all!
I wandered on and on in a maze
of wonder. Through flower sprinkled
meadows and beside the still waters
I stroiled, and wandering afar at
last I came upon a little hill. From
this vantage point I caught sight of
a group sitting disconsolate, their
crowns disprized, cast down; their
harps unstrung lying idle by their
sides! Discontenied they were,
unreconciled to Heaven! So shocked
was I, so seized with dire misgiv
ings I drew closer. Sorrow in heav
ta? Yes, those were real tears upoa
their cheek.-!
A fJreadJul doubt gripped me.
Was this Heaven? Could I have
been mistaken? I hurried back to
the pearly gates in agony of anxiety
and fear. "Oh, Good St. Peter!" I
gasped tell me, IS this Heaven?
"Why yes, my child!" said the
saint, kindly his hand upon my
forehead. This is indeed the abode
of the Blest ! Why do you ask?"
I told him my discovery, to!d him
U1 uie tears and sorrow 1 naa seen,
and besought him to explain how
suth things could be
"Pshaw," said the old Saint testi

TEN-YEAR-OLD LAD KILLED
Child Kcocks Shotgun From Rack
Striking Floor Explodes, the Load
Taking Effect in Neck of
Playmate
A most distressing accidpnt nr.
I curred Sunday morning at 9 o'clock !
-w w w
near Trinity at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. J. R. Jordan when Robert
Shelby Welborn, 10 year old son of
R. L. Welborn of this city, met a
terrible death.
The lad was on a visit to his un
cle and aunt and was playing with
two other young boys in.a room, in
which was a bed and hanging over
the bed was a shot gun. The hovs
spied it and one of them reached
for it while Shelbv Welhnrri th
victim, and another boy were on
the floor. The gun fell and as it
struck the floor discharged its load,
striking young Welborn in the neck,
severing the jugular vein and car
toid arteries. Death resulted in
stantly. Drs. I. T. Mann and Claude
il. Reitzel were called but found
the boy dead. Their attention was
directed, however, to Mrs. Jordan
who was prostrated with grief and
for an hour efforts were made to
quiet her. The dead boy was a spe
cial favorite of his aunt whom he
often visited. The father of Shelby
lives at 1013 South Main.
The accident cast a gloom over the
entire community. The funeral
services were conducted at Houe-
well church Monday afternoon by
Rev. H. F. Robbins of South Main
Street M. E. Church, this city, and
Rev. E. N. Crowder, of Trinity and
the remains were laid to rest in the
Hopewell cemetery.

What "Old Citizen" Thinks
About the Proposed
Bond Issue.
To The Editor:
The discussions on the" necessity
of street improvements in our city
are all very well and good and the
splendid gentleman brought up from
Greensboro to discuss streets made
a clever talk. But any man who
knows anything about High Point
and its people knows there is no
need to talk to High Point people
aDout streets. ine jssue is not
streets at all and the recent vote
against bonds was not an expression
of sentiment against streets and
i bonds.
No one needs to talk about
our bad streets for the purpose of
convincing High Point citizens that
the streets need improving. Mr.
Murphy made no discovery when
he found poor streets here. High
Point people are not a lot of Mex
ican peons or Russian serfs, even if
living under an administration fur
nished us ready made from Greens
boro and Raleigh. Several years ago
it may have been necessary to deny
the black districts of Eastern North
Carolina the right of local self-gov-
ernment, byt the people of High '
mm -
romt sternly resent the imputation
that they are incaple of attending
to their own affairs. We do not need
Greensboro people to urge us to
build streets. The very suggestion
that this is a missionary field need
ing outside persuasion to get street
improvements, shows that the one
who makes the suggestion does not
understand High Point people. Do
not try to muddy the waters. Keep
the issues clear cut. The ancestors
of many voters of this city staked
their lives and their fortunes against
Great Britain upon the issue of rep-
resentative
government. And we
see every day about our streets a
few of those noble fellows who fol
lowed Lee as long as the thin Gray
line could live upon the bark and
leaves of trees, in a desperate effort
to maintain in this land Srates
Rights., Do not talkAs -of deeded
street improvement! Show us how
we can be true to our ancestor's and
to our fathers and act like decent
free born American citizens and
without protest relinquish our right
to vote? When again we may vote
does any one think we ought to
vote more taxes and raise other
funds for a Raleigh made city gov-
ernment to spend? If there is noth-
mg. in devotion nd principle then
we may lay aside our resentment
and accept the much needed street
improvements. But what do you
think oil Benedict Arnold? He for
got to devote himself to ideals and
ceased to resent English tyrany
when the much needed English gold
! was offered him. What High Point-,
era think of that sort of action has
been plainly indicated in ONE so
caned oona eieciion auu m
democratic primary.
Before we vote for more money
for cur Russianized city government
to spend let's destroy the history of
the Revolution or cease to honor
the men who followed Lee. And
could we do this?

David Matthews, white, was given
a four months road sentence in Re

ally brings to light the Hfe of a sav-
age rather than one "created just a
little lower than the angels."
David Matthews, wife and little
boy resided on Redding street in a
small house with very little if any
thing by the name of furnishings
within. A poor old blind horse and
a badly worn plow were the other
belongings of this household. The
man occasionally plowed a little
when the strength of the horse
would permit, and during black
berry, time the 'familv nicked the
seedy fruit for a living. The wife
and mother was in poor health and
there was not enough to eat in the
house to feed a cat one meal, much
less three people, and less for the
horse which had died the Sunday
before in the woods from starvation
The neighbors had tried to get Mat
thews to work and provide for fam
ily and beast but he was of a worth
less nature and refused to do so.
Judge Dalton told the wife to return
to her mother where she would be
better off and in the meantime he
would give her husband a course of
training during the summer months
on the roads of Guilford and proba
bly he would do something1 for a
livelihood when he returned. It is
hard to think of such a case exist
ing in a civilized community.

FLOODWEPT CAROtlNAS
Human life and Millions of Property
Exacted by the Flood King Western
North Carolina the Hardest Hit
Other Sections Suffer
North Carolina experienced the
greatest flood in its history the first
of the week. A property loss of
,515,000,000 is reported. The worst
conditions were in the western part
of the state where nine lives were
sacrificed. Lower Asheville and
Biltmore were submerged in water,
the depots at each place being under
8 feet of water. Houses and bridges
were swept away. Between Ashe-!
ville railroad and road bridges were
demolished and scores of houses
were destroyed. For - three days
Asheville was cut off from the out
side world. Similar conditions pre
vaiiea along tne water courses in
North Carolina, South Carolina, Vir
ginia, Tennessee and West Virginia.
Upwards of thirty lives lost are re
ported.
The Yadkin river was the highest
on record, doing much damage from
Wilkesboro to High Rock. The
reader will find more news about
the great flood in another part of
this paper.
THE RESCUE AT HIGH ROCK
Several visitors and members of
the Sunset Park Co. at High Rock
were marooned Sunday night on the
island. Monday morning the' water
got dangerously near the houses and
by eleven o'clock had covered prac
tically all of the island
The boats of the company were
destroyed and parties in the the
town of High Rock hurriedly con
structed a rough, square boat and
went to the rescue, James H. Alex

time. The houses while . flooded
and considerably damaged re
mained practically intact.
LITTLE BOY IN KNEE PANTS

Passengers oh No. 36 yesterday
report seeing a horrible sight at the
bridge over the Yadkin river at
Spencer. Floating by among some
rubbish was a small boy in knee
paats and shirt, who was drowned in
the recent floods somewhere above
there. It is a sad thing this inci
dent. Here was some mother s boy,
perhaps snatched from her embrace
as the waters surrounded and de
luged them, and sent to a watery
grave and now there the corpse
goes, bruised and beaten by the an
gry waters and Xno one to rescue,
perhaps to find its way into the sea
where cruel sharks or other great
monsters of the deep will devour
and the mother never know the fi
nal disposition of her flesh and
bone. But such is life terrible
things occur every day and how
thankful we should be (those that
enjoy life and security) that our lot
in life has been cast among more
pleasant surroundings.

pointment. The editor records the death of
Lee Aidridge with no little feeling of
regret. It has been our duty as a
newspaper man to chronicle the
deaths of many thousands during
the 25 years we have been "in the
harness." Some whom we did not
know, either personally or by repu
tation, but many of them whom we
did know and had the kindliest
feelings for, those whom we had
been in close touch with, those
whom we had learned to love and
admire and feel more than a passing
interest in.
We have known Lee Aidridge for
the past 25 years and in that time
we have learned something of his
rugged upright character. He was
a man who did not make any pre
tentions at prominence nor display
in the social or business world, but
beneath the work shirr, of a content
ed farmer beat a heart full of affec
tion for friends and loved ones, char
ity for the weak and erring and sin
cerity towards mankind, a kind
father, gentle husband and consid
erate fellow being. Some men ac
complish their life's work heralded
in pomp and splendor, and others
do just as good service in the1 quiet
walks of life such was the case of
of our friend, Lee Aidridge who

PERSONAL INFLUENCE
; Continued from last page
she would seek him out and appeal
to him to withdraw the order of
execution, trusting, we can easily
believe, much to her personal influ
ence over him, through the great
love which he bore for her. He
loved her with a tenderness born of
the sensual of his untamed nature
and guarding her favor with a jeal
ous care. Of this "love the queen
must have been conscious of, for
had the king not chosen her as the
fairest of all the maidens brought
before him and one who had pleased
him the most.
This is now a momentous time
in the life of Queen Esther as she
comes into the august presence of
the king. How her very heart
must have almost stopped beating
as she tremblingly "went into the
presence of the king as he sat upon
his royal throne." And "when the
king saw Esther the queen standing
in the court that she obtained favor
in his sight; and the king held out
the golden sceptre that was in his
hand." "Then said the king unto
her, what wilt thou Queen Esther
and what is the request? It shall
be even given thee to the half of
the kingdom."
With what joy and gladness Es
ther hears the words , that within
them salvation to her friends and
people! How quickly has the sky
cleared of its threatening storm and
brought the sunshine of peace and
hope.' Love asserts itself, influence
prevails and the Jews are saved.
