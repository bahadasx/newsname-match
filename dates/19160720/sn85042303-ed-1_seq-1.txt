IE II OVER
ing there Is a better feeling among
the farmers and business men of this
section as a result. Yesterday the
mercury reached 104 here and corn
was beginning to wither. The rain
came in the nick of time and the corn
in this section never looked better
than it does at the present time,
i The rain cooled the atmosphere
perceptibly and the sweltering heat
Jof yesterday is totally absent today
and the people are feeling much
better. Last night's rain assures this
section of an abundant corn crop, in
fact crops of all classes are looking
remarkably well. Farmers who were
in the city today were in a jubilant
I frame of mind and all feel that a
great crisis passed last night with the
coming of the rain.
Reports from allover the state in
dicate that the rain, was pretty gen
,'eral and evidently the heat wave has
been broken. Alreacy local cotton
men are beginning to make estimates
on this years crop and while they
are not willing to state positively
what the receipts here will be this
fall, agree that they will beat last
years harvest by several thousand
baIes- Thls 13 the first rainfall since
June 26-
ANNUAL FALL OPENING WILL BE
DISCUSSED AT THIS TIME. SEC
RETARY HAS PLANS READY TO
SUBMIT TO ORGANIZATION.
There will be a meeting of the Busi
ness Mens Association at the court
house Friday night at eight o'clock
when Secretary Gilbert will lay be
fore the members his plan for the an
nual fall opening immediately pre
ceeding the county fair.
Every detail of the plan has been
worked out by the secretary and
those with whom he has discussed it
believe it will prove a great success
and draw large crowds to this city.
The afternoon Is to tie devoted to a
pure food exhibition on an elaborate
scale, with factory representatives
putting on the show. The night will
be a window display by all merchants
with ' the proposed spectacular fea
ture. Mr. Gilbert has taken a few of the
members into his confidence and they
are enthusiastic and no publicity is
to be given the affair until passed on
by the association as a whole.
President Kreuger, treasurer C. E.
Ringer and chairman Dave Daube, of
the board of directors and a few
others express a hope that there will
be a full attendance at the meeting
and heartily concur in the secretary's
idea, that if carried out, Ardmore
will see her greatest crowd on Sep
tember 13.

DISTRICTS
AS DIVIDED
IN THE Cfllf
SOME MISAPPREHENSION AS TO
CORRECT BOUNDARIES IS SET
RIGHT BY THE DEPUTY COUNTY
CLERK.
There has been considerable' con
troversy in this city relative to the
actual division of the three commis
sioners' districts as applied to Ard
more, and much confusion was pre
dominant among the voters as a re
sult.
For the benefit of the voters and
candidates alike. Deputy County Clerk
R. W. Duke was asked to define the
boundaries of the three districts this
morning and to name the precincts,
in each, which he did with the fol
low result:
The first commissioners' district in
Ardmore comprises all that part of
the city east of Washington street
and north and south of Main street,
containing the following polling pre
cincts: 4, 5, 8, and 9.
That portion of the second commis
sioners district embraced in the city
is north of Main street and west of
Washington street, and contains poll
ing precincts 1, 2 and 3.
That portion of the third commis
sioners' district lying in Ardmore is
that portion of the city lying south
of Main street and west of Washing
ton street and contains precincts 6
and 7.
There has been some misconception
as to the boundaries of the districts
in this county, and the deputy clerk,
for the benefit of the misinformed,
compiled this from the official map of
the three districts.
Last night the candidates all gath
ered at Provence and some pretty
warm compliments were handed
around among them. The crowd seem
ed to enjoy the situation and gave its
approval In most hearty applause.
IV NOT USE
CITY ITER
FOR STREETS?
LARGE LAKE FULL THAT WOULD
SUPPLY CITY FIVE TIMES THE
SIZE, YET THE STREETS ARE
ANKLE DEEP IN DUST.
A citizen of the city offered a good
suggestion for the suppression of the
waves and clouds of dust that make
house keeping burdensome yesterday
when he advanced the idea, tluit the
city permit the citizens of the city
to use city water for sprinkling pur
poses in unlimited quantity basing
the charge for the same upon their
last montli3 meter reading. This he
maintains would practically eliminate
the dust evil that has been a pro
nounced nuisance since the protract
ed dry spell.
Nearly every home owner has a
hose and hydrant but they do not feel
like paying for the privilege of sprink
ling the city streets, whereas, if the
bridle was removed for a few weeks
the dust would be a thing of the
past and the city would be none the
worse for having done so.
He says that the resident tax pay
era of the city who never see a
sprinkling cart in their section of the
city are helping pay the taxes to
sprinkle the down town streets, and
he thinks it no more than fair that
the residential portion of the city be
given a little relief from the dense
clouds of lust
Good Rain at Wilson.
Henry Davis, rig building contractor
at Healdton, was here today. He states
that the rainfall last night at Heald
ton was lighter than it was here. In
the locality of Wilson the rain was
much more generous and at Loie
Grove only a shower fell. It seem?
from this that the rain wi sofrew'.at
spotted and that all localities did not
share equally.
With a paradii the prisoners of Sing
Sing prison, New York, welcomed
