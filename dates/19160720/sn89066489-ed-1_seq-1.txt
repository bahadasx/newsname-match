Perfomuuiee of Offi

Judge FredL. Williams of Jop
lin is making the race for the Dem
ocratic nomination for judge of
Division No. 2 of the Supremee
Court to fill the four years' unex
pired portion of the term of Judge
John C. Brown, deceased. "
In January, 1913, Judge Will
iams, then an attorney of the Jas-
ripr noiint.v bar. was elected Su
preme Court Commissioner-by the
unanimous vote of the several
. judges of "the Supreme Court, as
the successor ot Judge Henry w.
Bond. uton the commission. So
well did he perform his work in
that capacity that, in April, 1915,
at the end of the term to which he
was first appointed, he was again
elected by the unanimous, vote of
the court for another term as Com
missioner. "
- Concerning Judge - Williams
. nanrHAknv nnii fitness 'for the SU;
preme Judgeship the JopBn Globe
says: '"" " ; ' ! '-,
"As commissioner of the court,
.Tiidra Williams has been sitting
with Division No. 2. In that posi
tion his work, in writing opinions,
is the same as that of a judge.
His experience in that regard,
therefore, renders him .especially
available as a candidate for the
judgeship. His opinions have at
tracted the attention of the law
yers of the state, and by reason of
. their brevity, fairness and accur
acy of expression, have been con
sidered by many as, mooeis.
"During the three years that he
has been a member of the court he
I has been assigned and written his
full nroDortionate share of the
cases disposed of by the court dur
ing that time. "As shown by the
published volumes of the supreine
pnnrt reoorts. all of his opinions,
except one, .have been adopted by
the court, which is considered a
remarkable record in that regard,
and is convincing proof, of his
nualifications for the office to
which he seeks to be elected.
"Williams is in the -crime of
life and is considered wonderfully
.... .
equipped,, .botn mentally and
physically,' to perform the arduous
duties of this high office. He was
born on a farm in Indiana, in
which state he received his educa
tion, first attending the common
schools and later De Pauw . Uni
versity, where he graduated with
the degree Ph. B. After graduat
ing from the university he took
the law course at the Indiana law
. school at Indianapolis, where he
"was honor man of his class. " Like
many other , successful men,
Judge Williams had to earn his
way to an education. This he did
by teaching - school in winter
months and by working on a farm
r in summer. - While he was attend
ing law school he supported him
self by teaching night .school and
by giving private; lessons in Latin.
' ' "Upon finishing lav school he
. located at Joplin, where he rose
rapidly as a lawyer- of promi
i nence. - He was always active both
in civie affairs and politics,, but
that activity was marked by fair
: ness, thoroughness and unfailing
courtesy. ! He followed "the
straight, clean way in citizenship,
1 in politics and in his 'profession
(and at the time he was seleeted by
' the supiwe court as eeDjniasbn-
er he had iron tie Jasper Covsxy
' r Akwtfiat&m'a L'-est nisktl
the best traditions of the profes
sion. ' " Not only is J udge Williams
'classified a man of great learning
in the law, but his temperament is
such as to make him peculiarly
qualified for a position upon the
bench. He has a wide acquaint
ance .over the state, and on ac
count of his splendid record he has
received many offers of support
for the nomination he is seeking."

A NEIGHBOR.
Child Awarded to Adopted
. Parents.
In June, 1913, a man and woman
'and a little girl, three years old,
walked into the town of Foster.
They were penniless and the little
girl was badly in need of atten
tion. They represented themselves
as Mr. and Mrs. Fred Sheppard,
of St. Clair County, and said that
they were unable to longer keep
the little girl and wanted to give
it to someone who could care for
it. It was adopted by Mr. and
Mrs. F. A. Showier, who since
that time have given it the best of
care and become very much at
tached to it.
Recently a man who said his
name was Fred Sheppard, ap
peared and demanded the child,
claiming that the woman was his
wife and that she had ran off with
another man taking the child with
her. The Showlers refused to
surrender the child and the father
brought habeas corpus - proceed
ings before Judge. A. B. Owen for
its possession. ' It was shown that
the woman had filed suit for di
vorce in Henry county and after
wards in Girard, Kansas, but
whether the divorce was granted
in either place is not known.
The little girl had become very
attached to her foster parents and
wanted to stay with them and
Judge Owen, after hearing all the
evidence in the case, dismissed the
habeas corpus proceedings and
left the child with the Showlers,
where she has a fine home and will
bo taken care of and educated.
