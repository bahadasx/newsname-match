Aberdeen and Columbus to

Saturday.
Mr. E. L. Kuykendall, president
of the Columbus Baseball Associa
tion, has issued a call for members
of the organization to meet at the
. Chamber of Commerce at 8 o'clock
tonight, at which time Mr. L. B. I
Divelbiss, secretary and treasurer,
will submit a report showing the (
receipts and disbursements to date.
The local club was organized a
little more than a month ago to en
ter the Northeast Mississippi League
which is composed of Columbus, Tu
pelo, Aberdeen and West Po-int. The
attendance has been only fair, the
receipts at the different games hav
ing been just about sufficient to pay
the expenses of the visiting teams.
A goodly sum was subscribed by
local fans at the start, however, and
the club will probably have suffic
ient funds to finish the season
out without calling for additional
contributions.
Columbus will play in Aberdeen
today and tomorrow, and the twe
teams will cross bats here Saturday.
While the schedule calls for no Sat
urday contests, several games were
postponed on account of rain, and
the games to be played here Satur
day will count in the percentage
column.

citing game seen on the Lake Park

JACKSON HIM II
HON T. J. LOCKE, JR., RECEIVES
LETTER FROMn LOUISVILLE
" MAN.
Hon. T. J. Locke, Jr., local mem
ber of the executive committee of
Jackson Highway Association, is in
receipt of a letter from Hon. P. L.
Atherton, of Louisville, Ky., presi
dent of the organization, in which
he asks for information concerning
what has been done in this district
relative to the construction of the
route.
"We are now going into July,"
says Col. Atherton, "and it will be
only a little over two months and
a half before the palhfinding com
mittee will start on their inspection
on October 1. In addition to this
there are a number of reasons why
it would be very much of an advan
tage to the road to have at this of
fice at this time a report of what
has been done so far this season, and
what you are in shape to do and ex
pect to do between now and Oetober
first."
Mr. Locke in replying to Col.
Atherton's letter stated that the
route of the highway traversing this
county was in good shape. High
Waters washed away some of ths
roads-, but arrangements have been
made to repair them, and they will
be made in first class condition when
the pathfinders go over them in Oc
tober. ,' - ,
A log of the route of the Jackson
highway is to be included in the
Blue Book, the official publication of
the National Automobile Associa
tion, and arrangements are now be
ing made to secure the necessary
data, Hon. T. J. Locke, the local
member of the executive committee
of the highway association, having
agreed to superintend the work in
this immediate section.
The publishers of the Blue Book
have requested local automobilists
to furnish a car and a guide to be
used in logging the route between
Columbus and Meridian, aad this re
quest will be acceded to. There are
36 miles of the highway in this
county, and the people here will be
called upon to furnish the, money
'necessary to log this highway, which
.will, be about $36.

FURTHER INJURY
TO CROPS WROUGHT
Damage Now Seems Beyond
Repair and People Are Dis
consolate. After having experienced a few
days of comparatively clear weather
this section was visited by another
rainstorm Wednesduy and local
merchants and farmers, who were
just beginning to take a more hope
ful view of the situation, are again
gloomy and down-hearted, as there
seems to be no possible chance for
crops to recover from the damage
which has been sustained and the
yield of cotton, corn and other ag
ricultural products grown in the
territory contiguous to Columbus
promises to be exceedingly meager.
The rain came up about noon yes
terday, and for nearly two hours
descended in torrents, gutters over
flowed, and in different places on
Main-and Market streets, the prin
cipal business thoroughfares of the
city, water stood several inches
deep.
The damage to crops is the worst
ever experienced here, being far
worse than in 1892, when this sec
tion last experienced such heavy loss
as the result of swollen stream.
Mr. B. B. Mitchener, who for

Twenty-five thousand ton3 of
coal, owned by the Gulf & Ship Is
land Railroad Company, used as
fuel for the trains and for the big
shops of the company located atj
Hattiesburg, u afire at that place,
and efforts on the part of the road
officials and the Hattiesburg fire de
partment to suppress the flames, are
unavailing. The fire is entering on
its second week. Already more than
1,200 tons have been consumed and
the blaze is gradually spreading
through two of the four small moun
tains of coal heaped up in the shop
yards. Spontaneous combustion it is
believed started the fire. Water
won't stop it. It will be necessary to
remove the greater part of it.
Having lost everything they pos
sessed in the recent storm on the
coast, Mr. and Mrs. Roy Favor, of
Columbus, Ga., decided to hobo their

old and the husband 24.
The schooner W. D. Cash, fishing
out of Tampa, Fla., has put back in

fish on board.
General Cipriano Castro, one time
president of Venezuela, who arrived
in New York recently from Trinidad,
have been ordered deported by a
special board of inquiry at Ellis Is

against Gen. Castro, however, is said
to involve moral turpitude. The. or

characterized as technical.
Dr. W. C. Brewer, health officer
of Lowndes county, is taking precau

Commission.
El his, Texas. July IS, A
party of mounted Mexicans ex
changed fire with company L of
the Xinth Maism husetts Infantry
here today. According to report
the guardsmen were doing outpost
duty when the Mexicans rode up on
the opposite bank of the Rio Grande
and opened fire. The guardsmen
suffered no casualties but reported
they believed they had killed one
Mexican.
I'upt. Hickey, of Dorchester,
Mass., commanding the company,
estimated the number of Mexicans
at 15, but asserted that he was un
able to determine whether or not
they were soldiers. Approximately
f0 shots were fired on each side, it
was said.
Roth pen. George Bell, Jr., com
manding the El Paso military dis
trict, and Lieut-Col. Leon Buclon,
acting garrison commander in Jaur
ez, saW they had received no official
reports of the incident and both said
it seemed trivial.
The shooting occurred in an rso
lated district about three miles down
the river from El Paso. The Massa
chusetts company was doing patrol
duty in this section.
Capt. Hickey said that throughout
the day small parties ef Mexicans
t.ppeared from time to time n chu
Mexican bank of the river, wich is
nbout 300 yards wide at thi point.
Then, he said, a mounted detach
ment appeared, most of the horse
men wearing red seraphs.
The Mexicans lode up the river
bank, dismounted and deployer as
skirmishers, creeping through the
underbrush which dotted the river's
edge. One of the Mexicans fired his
rifle, the bullet crossing the river
and, according to Private Charles
Prescott, dropping at his feet.
The Americans returned the fire
and by the time the reserves reached
the river to re-enforce them they had
driven the Mexicans back to their
horses. Before reaching the picket
line, however, the militiamen assert,
one of the Mexicans stumbled and
fellSn a clump of grease wood and
did not rise.

One ear from each soldier had been
severed. Following the "operations"

"After the fight," they said, "we
were ordered to stand before an

placed before us. We thought death

"Then a Villista officer appeared
before us, asking which we prefer
red death or to have our ears cus
off. We choe the latter. One by
one we were seized, bound and laid
on the ground. Then three Villista
officers with sabers began the
bloody work."
Gen. Canuto Reyes, commander
of the new Carranza garrison at
Jirninez arrived here unexpectedly
today and brought official reports
to Gen. Trevino of Villa's position

"Villa has moved from his base
at Cerro Gordo to within 10 miles

Reyes reported. "He has more than
