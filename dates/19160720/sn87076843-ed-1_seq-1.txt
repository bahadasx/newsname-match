Perrysburg made a flying start
by scoring two runs in the first in
ning. F. Reis walked. OnC.Reis'
infield tap Jackson fumbled the
ball, both runners were safe. Each
moved up a base on Harper's out.

run knocking the ball over the right
field fence scoring Taylor ahead of
him. In the seventh they scored

When the traveler from afar
comes to visit this valley, he is at.
once impressed with the many
places of historic interest that are
scattered up and down the Mau
mee for miles and miles. Not only
are these spots along the river but
they are to be seen back far into
the country about.
We will take them in the order
of their origination and tell some
thing of each one in order to in
spire -those who care for further
research as well as to again revive
in the minds of many that which
they; in all probability have in the
past been well acquainted.
Fort Defiance.
Whdrc the Auglaize river enters
the Maumee at Defiance, is located
the old earthwork known as' Ft.
Defiance. It was a small work,
but highly important. It was built
in the summer of 1794 by "Mad"
Anthony Wayne who with an
army of two thousand men was
advancing into this valley to at
tack the Indian tribes. When
Wayne had finished the fort he
jumped down off the rampart, and
said : "There, I defy the British or
Indians or all the devils in hell to
take this work." One of his offi
cers then said, "Call it Fort Defi
ance," and thus it was named.
Fort Deposit
Near Rushtaboo, Rock, just
above Waterville, Was built in
August of the same year, Fort De
posit. Wayne also built this work.
It was erected as a place of de
posit for his baggage and stores
when he should give battle to the
Indians, which he did the very
next day, August 20, 1794. Noth
ing is now to be seen of the old
work but the place may be pointed
out. k
Presque lie Hill.
This is a high bluff along the
Maumee midway between Maumee
and Waterville. Skirting the hill
from the river and again to the
river is a long and wide ravine.
In this ravine, full of fallen tim
bers in'ade tangled by a recent
cyclone, is where the Indians with
Red Jacket, their Chief, were hid
den on the morning of August 20,
1794, when they were attacked by
Wayne and routed with great
slaughter. At the east end of the
ravine .near the river may be seen
"Turkey Foot Rock," upon which
the fabled Chief "Turkey Foot"
stood as ho tried to rally his de
feated red men, and from which
ho was shot by one of Wayne's
soldiers.
Fallen Timbers.
This battle was named after the
place around and in which it was
fought.
The battlefield of Fallen Tim
bers really extended from the
west end of Presque He Hill down
to Fort Miami, as well as back
from the river nearly two miles.
It was a hard fought battle, and
was important' as two former
fights with the Indians of the
northwest had been very dis
astrous in tho extreme. We refer
to the defeats of Gen. Ilarmer and
that of Gen. St. Clair.
McKeo's Trading Post.
Below Maumee a short distance
was located the notorious McKee
Trading Post. The proprietor of
this post was a Britisher. This
trading post was a distributing
point, from which arms and iinui
nition and food was supplied to
tho red men in the summer of
1794, and directly from the coffers
of "His Majesty's government."
American scalps wore here count
ed by McKco and forwarded to
Detroit. Horo it was that British
(Continued on Eighth Pago.)
There are only ten days left be
fore the Chautauqua opens, and
while the sale of tickets has been
quite satisfactory,- there is still a
large number of season or course
tickets to be sold before the. Chau
tauqua Ooinmitee can "breathe
ensy."
Eight hundred dollars' worth of
course tickets must be sold be
fore the opening day of the Chau
tauqua .or the Chautauqua Com
mittee will bo compelled to "dig
down" 'for the balance unsold.
There are many towns one
fourth the size of Perrysburg that
have a Chautauqua annually and
make -them pay out, and there is
no reason why it should not pay
out in Perrysburg if the citizens
will help by purchasing course
tickets.
No one can afford to miss this
great five day course of educa
tional, beneficial and inspiring en
tertainments, if you will buy
tickets and attend regularly you
will not regret the time and tho
little money.
Mr. and Mrs. Loyal Citizen, it is
in your hands to make this great
beneficial undertaking a success or
a failure, and, Mr. Farmer and
family, you also should take a live
ly interest in the Chautauqua.
Will your name be on the list next
week ?

DIARRHOEA QUICKLY CURED
"About two years ago I had a severe
attack of diarrhoea which lasted for
over a week," writes W. C. Jones, Bu

recommended Chamberlain's Colic,
Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy. The
first dose relieved me and within two
days I was as well as ever." For sale

WHY ENDURE SUMMER COLDS?
It isn't necessary to have a stuffed
head, running nose. To cough your
head off as it wero. All you need do is
to use Dr. Bell's Pine-Tar-Honey. The
soothing and healing balsams open the
clogged air passages and in a short
time you get relief and start on the
road to recovery. Your nose stops
running, you cough less and you know
you are getting better. Got a bottle,
uso as directed. Keep what is loft as

TRAVELING MAN'S EXPERIENCE
"In the summer of 1888 I had a very
severeattack of cholera morbus. Two
physicians worked over me from four
a. m. to G p. m. without giving me any
relief and then told me they did not
expect mo to live; that I had best tele
graph for my family. Instead of do
ing so, I gave the hotel porter fifty
cents a,nd told him to buy me a bottle
of Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera and
Diarrhoea Remedy, and take no sub
stitute. I took a double dose according
to the directions and went to sleep
after the second dose. At five o'clock
mo next morning I was called by my
order and took a train for niv next
stopping point, a well man but feeling

P. M. Hcllfrisch was well equip

was stolen before the car reached

"P. M." will offer a reward for tho
conviction of the culprit.

dertook the task of entertaining the
party by singing. It was fortunate
for the singers that they sang only
while the car was in motion, other
wise there would have been some
bodily harm done them by "out
siders" who could not appreciate
their offerings.
Nearly all of the party took ad
vantage of the opportunity to go in
bathing and the only calamity that
befell the bathers was while John
Anion was on the lookout for sharks
lost control of his bathing trunks,
which refused to answer the pur
pose for which they were intended.
Those who were fortunate enough
to be along profited immensely.
There is no doubt that a trip of
this kind will become an anuual
event among Perrysburg's business
men.
