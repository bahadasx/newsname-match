SETTLEMENT OF
MEXICAN CRISIS
SEEMS NEARER
Polk Reports Progress in Ne
gotiations After Confer
ence with Arredondo.
Further satisfactory progress in the
preliminary negotiations between the
United States and Mexico was reported
yesterday afternoon by Acting Secretary
of State Polk.
Mr. Polk had two conferences with
Elisec Arredondo, the Mexican Am
bassador designate. An announcement
that the preliminary negotiations have
been definitely concluded Is probable
within the next few days. according to
the State Department.
The delay. it is explained, is caused
by the fact that minor questions crop up
which Mr. Arredondo does not feel at
liberty to decide without consulting First
Chief Carransa. This necessitates an ex
change of telegrams from Washington to
Mexico City.
* GOlcial confirmation of the appoint
tment of a commission comprised of United
States and Mexican represeatatives to
settle the cdntroversy is still withheld
here despite press reports from Mexico
City announcing the appointment of the
Mexican commissioners.
HUGHES GRIPS
PARTY REINS
Demands Unity and Calls a
Halt on Factional
Quarrels.
(By the International News Service.)
New York. July 19.-Charles E. Hughes
today brought the factional bickerings
in Republican ranks to a head by crack
ng the party whip and commanding al
hands to get together.
Mr. Hughes's assumption of militant
leadership was almost sensational. He
arrived in town from Bridgehampton
with the echo of petty disputes ringing
in his ears. The Old Guard element was
complaining that too much favor had
been shown the Bull Moosers. The Pro
gressives were insisting that the plan to
put national committeemen in charge of
the campaign in' the various States, left
them out in the cold.
The nominee had a long conference with
National Chairman Willcox, and then
:ane the explosion. Mr. Hughes declared
that all hands were in this fight to win.
His Western trip, he declared, would be
under the auspices of the campaign com
mittee. who would co-operate with the
national committee in the various States,
who in turn will be expected to co
operate with every element in the party
to the end that absolute unity and har
mony may be accomplished.
There is no time. Mr. Hughes de
elared. for any one to take up the petty
auarrels of any faction in the party.
