The fifty first convention of the
Missouri Sunday School Association
will be held in this city November 14,
15, and 16, 1918. This will be one of
the .biggest conventions ever held in
this city, and it is especially urgent
at this time that the people of Mex
ico and of Audrain county do all in
their power to make it a grand suc
cess, for Audrain county, though one
of the youngest in the organization,,
is already considered one of the
strongest. It has held a front line
position, a place of honor, for the last
two years, going into that position
during ita first year of membership
in the association.
The standing of the counties in this
organization are based on the County
Standard, including ten points which
are: 1, County Organized and Con.
vention Held; 2, Annual statistical
report to the State Association; 3,
Annual Contribution to the State Ab
sociation; 4, County represented at
the state convention; 5, Organinzed
by Townships, each holding an annual
convention or institute; 6, at least four
departmental superintendents at
work; 7, 40 per cent of the schools
with cradle rolls; 8, 20 per cent with
Home Departments; 9, 10 per cent
with Teacher Training Classes; 10,
20 per cent with "Teen-age or Adult
Classes organized and holding corti
cate s.
The grades fall into three classes;
Front Line, those counties having all
ten points. Banner, those countieB
having the first four and any other
two points and Organized, those hav
ing the first three points.
The fact that Audrain has been a
front line county for the past two
years and made that class its first
year in the association speaks well lor
the Sundav School workers ot Mils
county.
Since this county holds such an
enviable position in the association,
it behooves the people of Mexico to
throw open their homes to the visitors
and do all in their power to help AU
drain keep its high reputation as i
Sunday School County.

Major J. C. Etoy was elected to the
McMillan High School faculty at the
meeting of the School Board Monday
night He will teach manual train
ing and have supervision of the Mc
Millan Band and Orchestra.' Major
Stoy taught manual training at Mis
souri Military Academy last year,
and his work in this department put
the course on a much stronger basis.
He is also a good man in music work
and last year had charge of the Acad'
emy Band and the McMillan Band. He
organized a band at the latter school
from a bunch of young boys, mostly
freshmen, who could not play any uv
strument at all, and has developed a
splendid band in a year's time. Stoy
is also an orchestra leader and a base
ball coach. Since Mr. Culbertson, who
has coached the baseball team for
two years, has resigned, the election of
Stoy to the McMillan faculty, be
comes more valuable. He is attending
Missouri University this summer
and is taking a special course in his
line of work ,
Mrs. C. A. Buckner was elected
Monday night to teach Commercial
Work at McMillan for the coming
year. This is one.oi tne most vaiua.
ble and practical courses in the high
school curriculum and with a teacher
of Mrs. Buckner's experience and
ability at the head of the course it will
be a splendid opportunity for those
who wish commercial training. Mra.
Bf.ckner has taught commercial work
at Hardin for a number of years and
at one time conducted a Commercial
School in this city .
Miss Willie Hook was elected to the
North Side Grade School to take the
place left by Miss Zola Beal.

In a letter to Moberly friends, Lee
Shootman, formerly of this city, a
son of Lou Shootman, tells the fol
lowing interesting things about the
patriotic men who are in the service
of the government proteefmg onr
country from invasion and deprcda-
iton by the Mexicans.
The following is taken from the Mo
berly Democrat:
"I joined the army at Richmond
last month, was mustered in at Sac-.
remento, California, and sent to the
Mexican border. We are now in
camp and expect to be called to arms
to take Mexico at any time. When
we do some one is going to stay on
Mexican soil.
"Well, I was woring for the Stan
dard 01 Co., when I enlisted, so I
draw my regular pay, $85 per month.
and there are about twenty others
in our company from the Standard
and they are drawing their regular
salaries. Pretty good pay for a sol
dier from $75 to $110 per month.
"I belong to Company B., second
California Infantry. We are located
in Nogales, Arizona, and the border
line runs through the center of this
town. This is a dry state and it is
a good thing, for there are about ten
thousand soldiers here and there
would certainly be some disorder if
they could get plenty of booze. Still
they can get it for $5 a quart- just
a little too step for the boys.
"This is surely a fine climate and
we have a fine company ground, only
about ten blocks from town. We were
all mobolized at Sacremento, Califor
nia, and they vaccinated us. Each
one got a shot in the arm to prevent
the spread of smallpox and typhoid
fever. Today we get another shot
and it is said that the vaccine costs
$75 per patient but our Uncle Sam
uel pays the doctor bill."

The sum of $85,000,000 of Federal
funds is made available for the con
struction of rural roads by the pas-
sage of the Federal Aid Road Bill,
July 11, 191CU Oi this sum, $75,000,-
000 is to be expendedfw the construe
tion of rural post roads, co-operating
with the highway departments of the
States, and $10,000,000 to be expend
ed for roads and trail within or part
ly within the National forests. The
act limits the government's share in
road work in co-operation with the
States to 50 per cent of the estimated
cost of construction. Federal aid may
be extended to the construction of any
rural post road, excluding all streets
or roads in towns havipg a population
cf 2,600 or more except the portions
of such streets or roads on which the
houses are more than 200 feet away.
Five million dollars is made avail
able during the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1917, and thereafter the ap
propriation is increased at the rate of
five millions a year until 1921, when
the sum provided is twenty-five mil
lions, making a total of seventy-five
millions. i
The class of roads to be built and
the method of construction are to be
mutually agreed upon by the Secreta
ry of Agriculture and the State High
way departments.
The various states securing aid
under the provisions ox the act are
charged with the making of needed
repairs and the preservation of a
reasonably smooth surface, consid-
ing the type of the road, but are not
obliged to makei extraordinary re-
repairs or undertake
tion. If, after due notice, a State fails
to maintain a federally aided road
properly, the Secretary is required to
refuse further aid until the road nas
been properly repaired at State ex-
nense.
Apportionment of Funds Among we
States.
The act provides that after making
necessary deductions for administer
ing its provisions, not to exceed 3
per cent of the appropriation for any
onj fiscal year the Secretary of
Agriculture shall apportion the re
mainder of each year's appropriation
in the following manner:
One-third in the ratio which the
area of each State bears to the total
area of all states;
One-third in the ratio which the
population of each State bears to the
total population of all the btates,
, One-thirdr in the ratio whicn tne
mileage of rural delivery routes and
star routes in each State bears to the
total mileage of rural delivery
routes and star routes in all the

T. J. Troy Killed.
T. J. Troy, Road Master on the C.
& A. between Kansas City and Mex
ico, from 1888 to 1900, was killed
in Lexington, 111, Wednesday. Mr.
Troy, who was Road Master at that
place, was driving his motor car,
when it struck a passenger train. He
is the father of G. T. Troy, who is a
conductor on the Western Division
of the C. & A. and working out of
Fulton. It is thought the body will
be brought to Slater tomorrow for
burial.
Mr. Troy left the employ of the
company in 1900 and returned in
1915 to take charge of an extra gang
on the Western Division. At the time
of his death he was Road Master on
the Alton at Lexington, 111. t

The Fulton Sun reports a small cy
clone in the Concord vicinity near
that city Monday afternoon. For 45
minutes the rain fell in torrents and
the wind blew a gale. A buggy shed

was blown down and a long section
of rail fence was blown down and scat
tered over the road.
FRESNO, Cal, July 19. K pal
ace motor car to be used for a trans
continental tour is now being con
structed in San Francisco for Mrs.
George M. Kohler, of Fresno. The
car will be completed and delivered
in this city on July 20. The cost of
the car is reported to be more than
$10,000.
The motor car is the first of its kind
ever to be constructed. It is a verit
able Pullman on motor wheels, and
was designed in the main by Mrs.
Kohler.
Mrs. Kohler placed the order for
the car several months ago, it being
her idea to start a tour this spring of
the continent. Construction went for
ward rather slowly, however, and ow-1
ing to the lateness of delivery it will
be impossible to start the overland
trip before next spring.
A marked feature of the new palace
car is the fact that expence has not
entered into the body design in the
slightest degree. The inclosed type
with portable plate glass windows
and complete built in effect through
out, finished in finest mahogany, pro
duces a combination of luuxury and
durability. The body of the car is
eighteen feet long, eight feet wide
and six feet and one half feet high.
It is patterned in a great degree
after a Pullman. The beds are regu
lar Pullman berths, which can be op-
.nod nd closed at will. The car is
eauiDPed with swinging chairs.
A complete electrical lighting piani
provided, the electricity being gen
erated from the engine. The car is
equipped with a modern bathroom and
huge chests for clothing . A 50-gallon
water tank gives the power for a com
plete water system.
The car can be divided into apart
ments, making Kitcneneue, uimuB
room and sitting room.
Mrs. Tabitha Mildred, aged 87, died
at ehr home in this city early Wed
nesday morning. She was born in
Kentucky December 2, 1828. On
May 27, 1852 she was married to Dan
iel H. Mildred. In 1853 she moved to
Missouri and lived near Hatton until
about ten years ago, when she moved
to Mexico. Her husband died in 1895.
She is survived by one brother and
one sister, John Mildred of Dover,
Colorado and Mrs. Fannie Coons,
and eight children; Mrs. Nannie R.
Sipple, of Fayette, Mrs. C. H. Brown,
of Mexico, C. A. Mildred, of Benton

Ultra-Violet Raya Will Be Used to
Sterilize the Water Comple
tion Early This Fall.
The proposed natatorium for Har
din College wil be under construction
within two weeks, according to Ben
Elliott, architct, who drew the plans
for the structure. The building will
be located just east of the splendid
new gymnasium and will be of brick.
The first story will be completed this
year and a temporary roof erected
until a little later when the second
story will be added.
The pool will be twenty-four feet
wide and sixty feet long and will hold
60,000 gallons of water. The Missouri
Military Academy pool is eighteen
feet by forty feet and holds 85,000
gallons of water. The Hardin pool
will be lined with white enamel brick
and go from a depth of three feet
to seven and a half feet.
It will be sterilized by electricity
using the ultra-violet rays to keep
it clean. This is the very latest metn.
od and is in use in this state only in
the M. A. A. and Forest Park High
land pools in St. Louis. In the latter
pool the water was tested after 18
months' use and found to be purer
than that runing through the mains
for general use in the city . This
method of keeping the pool sanitary
is practically perfect.
Mr. Elliott says there will be show
er baths and all modern improve
ments. He expets the job to be com
pleted early in the fall.

NICKELS WORTH 6 CENTS NOW.
War Ha Increased Pri.ce of Metal
Over the Coinage Value.
NEW YORK, July 19. The Eu
ropean war, upon which almost all ab
normal conditions are blamed these
days, has boosted the actual value of
the United States 6-cent piece to six
cents.
Since the war value of nickel has
gradually risen. This increase nas
been due to the great demand for the
metal for the manufacture of muni
tions and weapons. Back in the days
when the world was at peace there
was actually about one and one-quarter
cents' worth of nickel in every
American 5-cent piece.
