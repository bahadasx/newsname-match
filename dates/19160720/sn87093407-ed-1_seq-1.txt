PLAN FOR GREAT

WOULD COST $8,182,000
Councilman R M. Thomion,
at Thursday's meeting of the
elty utilities committee, un
folded hi* ideas on a plan to
give Seattle a sure and suffi
cient supply of water, for year*
to come, even to the period
when her population will have
reached the 1,000.000 mark.
It Include* enlarging the «ourr«
of supply, the construction of all
•reel mains, and great reservoirs In
the city.
The comprehensive plan, which
would be worked out gradually, In
clude* Improvement* costing $H t .
1*2.000 '
The first three steps, he says,
would cost about $.1,000,000
He believe* the people should
have an opportunity to vote upon
these Improvements neit spring
"We should first acquire
Swan lake, between Cedar river
and Seattle, and convert it Into
a great impounding reservoir,"
he said, "and connect It with
pipe lines.
"Then we should construct
two big reservoir* in West Se
attle, or at least acquire the
land for them,
"The third immediate step
for consideration is the con
struction of all steel pipes from
the Impounding reservoir at
Swan lake."
Thomson planned the city'* or
Iglnal water system.
This Illustrates one way of impressing name* by linking them up
thru an association of ideal.
I have fixed in memory the name of Secretary of War Baker thru
the fact that he it an inveterate PIPE SMOKER
He BAKEB hit pipe by constant amoking. It it easy to recall the
pipe, and that brings up the name.

HAMILTON SAYS
HE ASPRES TO
JOB K OLYMPU
T AFf; MAMIITf )N has told his secret to The Star.
Up at his political headquarters, 306 Oriental
building, Wednesday afternoon, he confided to a Star
reporter this:
"I'm going to be sheriff first, then governor!"
Four years from today, I afe said, he would be in
the midst of his gubernatorial campaign.
This is no josh.
I afe really has ambitions.
So had Caesar.
So had Henry Ford.
• • • • •
I lir rfporter wanted to <-ee I.afe on important business,
t>t!t he I ,i'l expected no such reception, nor such a story as
he got when he entered the open door under the blazing red
sign, which read*: "Hamilton for sheriff."
I liru another open door I.afe could be seen seated at a
de«k, surrounded by his political henchmen and board of
advisors.
It was a motley crowd.
I.afe met the re(>ortcr in the outer room.
"I ju-t wanted to ask a few questions for The Star,"
the reporter said. "Will you tell the truth?"
"Certainly." -aid I.afe. "Fire away." J *
Ihe reporter had heaid, thru pretty authentic source#,
that I.afe had agreed with I.ou Smith, hand-picked candidate
for county commissioner from the South district. that if Smith
were circled an.l Hamilton got the job of sheriff. Smith would
see to it that the old graft system of feeding county jail pris
oners would l»e again adopted, and that Hamilton would get
the contract.
"Did you ever enter into an agreement with Lou Smith,"
the reporter asked Hamilton, "that in event he was elected
commissioner, the contract system of feeding prisoners would
be—?"
The reporter didn't get a chance to finish.
"Now. who tipped you off to that?" Hamilton a*ked.
"I couldn't tell you that." the reporter answered.
"There isn't a word of truth in it!" exclaimed the can
didate for sheriff.
"Was the subject ever broached at a meeting in the pres
ence of Morgan O'Brien. Commissioner Knudsen and others?"
( > Rrien is an old political war-horse from the South End
"Never was mentioned." Hamilton said. "Nor thought
of. Nothing to it. I have no interest in the South End fight
for commissioner. They're making their fight. I'm makinr
mine."
He hooked a thumb into the armhole of his vest,
inflated his lungs and glowed rosilv.
"Afterward," he said, "I'm going to be governor!
Ye», sir—governor of the state of Washington."
There was a hu*h in the other room. The "gang" was
listening.
Hamilton went on:
"I've got The Star tied to a post—licked. I've got an
organization in every precinct."
There was a raucous laugh from the other room
fndei the old Kraft s>stem of feeding prisoner*, the sheriff war
given a contract to furnish meals at the rate of 40 cents a dav per
prisoner.
Investigation at thai time showed the sheriff was cleaning ut
between $100,000 and tl - '>.000 every four-year terra under this system,
over and above the actual cost, and that conditions in the jail usually
were Intolerable
The men cooked for themselves The cheapest kind of food wa»
bought.
In the days of the old Kraft system the feeding actually cost frotr
fi to 8 centm per man. the sheriff pocketing the balance or the 40-ceiu
allowance. "

' What do yon think of this man Putnam for sheriff?" he
asked

The Star man was surprised.
"You don't reHllv moan that'.'" he nsked
"You bet Ido I'd like to nee this aon of a

he'll lose his rank as sergeant in the pollco department."
"But. on the level now," The Star man persisted, "don't you think

"Oh. sure"' readily agreed the. driißßlst. "I'vo sot to admit that
