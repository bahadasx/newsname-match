Boston, July JO.--A new element of
mystery In connection with tin inwstlga
tion of the shooting yestetdnv of Dr
Wilfred 12. Harris, president of the
Massn' husctts College of Osteopathy, by
Dr. Kldridgo D. At wood, one of his for
mer students, developed to-night as a
result of tho autopsy on the body of
Dr. Atwood's liancce, Dr. fella Palno
Adams, who died of poisoning a short
time before tho attack on Dr. Harris.
In view of the aliened declaration of
At wood I tint he shot Dr. Hams hei auso
Miss Adams had told him that Dr. Harris
had wronged her, tho autops was lookeit
upon as likely to have an Important
bearing on the case. In an informal
statement to-night the medical examiner,
Dr. George I!. Magrath, who examined
the body to-day announced nieiely that
Miss Adams "came to her death from
the elfects of poison received by the
mouth, the natuin of which Is at present
undetermined."
Both Dr. Hairls and Francis P. Adams,
father of Dr. Adams have denied the
charge of Dr. At wood icg.irding the
motive for the shooting.
The condition of Jlr. Harris was ro
ported as extremely critical at the hos
Pltal to-night.

Washington, July 19. Preliminary
negotiations between Acting Secretary
Polk and Hllseo Arredondo, Mexican
ambassador designate, for peaceful set
tlcmeiit of liorder difficulties, pro
glossed so well to-day that a, formal
announcement "very soon" as to the

predicted.
Tho conferees met twlco to-day.
iter Mr. Arredondo tolegruphed a re
port to his government and Jlr. Poll'
prepaid a similar leport for Secretary
anslng, now on his vacation, and
probably will talk tho situation over
with President Wilson to-morrow. Mr.
Banslng is lielng fully advised of every
step In the pielimlnary negotiations.
Henry P. Fletcher, ambassador
desiirnate to Mexico, was present at
both conferences, lntet pretlng when
ever It wab necessary to lusuie a clear
understanding. It Is understood the
discussions dealt particularly with tin-
powers to bo conferred upon a Joint
commission should that plan of settle
inent he followed. So far no definite
agreement on the course to bo pursued
has been toadied, hut to-day's de
velopments indicated that only final
word from (Jeneral Carranza and Presl
dent Wilson was lacking. It was
stated officially that tho American
commissioners had not been selected.
It is understood Mr. Fletcher will go to
his post in Mexico City soon after Secre
tary Lansing returns from his vacation
about August 1. provided the favorahlo
tuin of events beyond the border eontln
'ies. At the same time Mr. Arredondo
will be formally received by President
llsnn as ambassador from the republic
of Mexico and full diplomatic relations bo
restored.
A despatch from (Jeneral Pershing to
day saving thot General fion.ales had
conferred with htm as to reports of the
selzuie of tho Hearst ranch In Chihuahua
and then bad pioceeded to Investigate the
case, was viewed hern as further evidence
of the more conciliatory attitude of all
Carranza olliolals. fleneral Peishlng had
called afrntlon to this chango previously
sajing that the geneial opinion of those
Mexicans v, itli whom he came in contact
was that a peaceful adjustment of all
dltlh ultlc would bo found.
The war department announced to-day
i further relaxation of tile unofficial rm-
baigo imposed at the border when the
Mexican emergency became acute. Coal,
coke ami gasoline for industrial purposes
and household goods now will bo permit
ted to pass Into Mexico In reasonable
quantities.

Baltimore, July 10. At 11 o'clock to-
nluht tho two spars of tho German
merchant submnrlno wore taken down
and the conning towor closed. Closo
at hand lay the tug, Thomas K. Tlra-
mins, with a full head of steam up.
In the vicinity of the submarine ivoro
numerous launches with agents of the
Eastern Forwarding company and
pnttols aboard. Theso craft at lliOS
o'clock hailed a newspaper launch and
tried to induce tho icportcrs to leave,
"You're interfering with our plans," tha
watchman said.
To ail appearances tho Deutschland was
ready to leavo at any time. Her masts
and f ill crew were said to be aboard.
Among tho late events that tended to
confirm this belief was the stowing o
moro than D tons of fuel oil on tho sub
marine late this afternoon. An official In
terested In the submarine activities ear
lier In the day sought to create tho Im
pression that the two tank cars ot oil had
been run on to the pier whom tho
Deutschland was berthed were Intended

"Kntanglcd in these, the submarine

engines will bo crippled, and It 'will
be a slow and agonizing death to all

They talk of it continually whll

Dr. Banks nnd his aslstants were

Baltimore.. July 19. It is now definitely
learned that the dye cargo nt the subma

came In small cases about J) by ?) by 30
Inches, with the color of tho particular

The average weight of the cases ran

each. Slightly more than 1,'M cases wer

New York, July 1?. It was reported
yesterday that the packages of dyes

Ordinarily dyes are not entered to any ex

Should this plow to he the fact, appraisal
of the d.M'stulTs would have to be based
on prevailing American rates for such
products.
As many of tho colors biought over by
tho Deutschland have been virtually out
of this market for many months, with
prices between and .Wl per cent abnvs
1101 mnl for such small quantities as could
be scraped from all parts ot the world, It
seemed certain that the official appraisal
would tlx values calling for exceptionally
high duties.
