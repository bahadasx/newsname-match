DEATH OF A
$200,000 INDIAN
Big Jimmie-, the oldest and wealthiest
Indian on the Fort Hall Reservation,
died very suddenly Monday morning at
4 o'clock. His death is quite a mystery,
as he has always been in good health
and spirits. His demise came as sudden
ly as though he had been shot. The
Reservation and another doctor claim
that his death was due to some trouble
of his head which they did not explain.
Deceased was born in the vicinity of
Boise about seventy years ago, and
leaves a wife, a 45-year-old son and two
other children.
He was one of the first denizens of
the Reservation, and his estate, con
sisting of land and stock, will appraise
in the neighborhood of $200,000.
His funeral took place in the Reserva
tion cemetery last Wednesday. He was
nu exceptionally good and provident In
dian, and Ralph Dixie, his secretary,
Bays he does not believe he had an
enemy.
BINGHAM COUNTY'S BAD BOADS
While at the Lake Hotel in Yellow
stone Park one evening last week J. H.
Early was with a party of men smok
ing in the lobby when the general sub
ject of roads came up. The travelers
were from almost every state in the
north Union. All were strangers to each
other and none knew- that Early was
from Bingham county, Idaho, and' when
one man who had driven from Chicago
to the West Coast, through Yosemite
Park, thence through to the Yellow
stone, saiil that the very worst roads
encountered in the trip of 6000 miles
was thirty miles in and out of Black
foot; Mr. Early at once admitted his
residence and his connection with tho
good roads movement and made apol
ogies. He acknowledged the very bad
condition occasioned by the inexperi
ence of the several county commission
ers in road building and their attempts
to patch roads after the spring rain
season. Mr. Early reports h macadam
road from Ashton to St. Anthony, a
distance of about 25 miles, where any
conveyance can be run at its limit of
speed and the laws; also that from
Idaho Falls to Blnckfoot, while in
Bonneville county, the roads are fair
and that in Bingham county they are
very rough, requiring two and a quarter
hours to make the twenty-five miles.
D. II. Biethan has returned from a
trip to California.

WHERE THERE ARE
NO UNEMPLOYED
There are no legitimately unemployed
men in this bailiwick. Every able bodied
man who wishes worn can readily find
it. If a man is idle here, it is his own
fault- He wishes to be so and hides
himself from the employer.
Why, the street work alone is occupy
ing the working hours of all the willing
workers to be found. The Eecles hotel
has a small army at work preparing
the basement excavation for the super
structure. And Tuesday morning a score
of nw>M,..hi olio body, left this city for
the hay fields on a big ranch near
Challis.
The myriad fields of this valley call
for men in ever increasing numbers.
The problem here is not to find work
for the unemployed but to find the un
employed to do the work.
That is why Blackfoot is becoming
known as a center of industrial activ
ity, and one reason for the groat influx
of new people that has come this year.
PUBLIC LIBRARY OPENS
■ The Blackfoot Public Library will
open next Saturday afternoon to its pa
trons, and will be open every Saturday
from 3 o'clock to 5:30 in the afternoon,
and from 7:30 to 9, in the evening; it
«ill also be open at the same time on
Tuesdays and Sundays.
There are considerably more than 600
books in the library, much good fic
tion. juvenile books, and reference
works, etc.
A few of the late novels will lie loaned
for seven days, upon a payment of ten
edits.
Transients from the hotels will lie
nskid to deposit the price of the bonk
before borrowing, to guarantee return
of same.
(Vine mid visit the library, even
though you do not want a book; every
one is welcome.
STRANDED ON THE DESERT
While coining from his thoroughbred j
stock farm at Moore last Tuesday, E. j
M. Kennedy and family and a guest
had a very unpleasant experience. When
in the heart of the desert the axle of j
his auto broke, about 8:30 o'clock, an<j
it looked like the party would all have ,
to camp in the sands of the desert. !
Fortunately the Gem State laundry i
wagon same along about 8:30 and took
Mrs. Kennedy and her lady friend
home, leaving Mr. Kennedy and his
friend and family to camp all night in
the auto. Next morning Mr. Kennedy
walked 18 miles to Taber where lie se
cured necessary conveniences to bring !
his friend and family home.
It is reported that Bill Scott of Poca
tello will soon return to Blackfoot and
Open a drug store in his sister's build
ing now occupied by Tim Hayes.

JUDGE SULLIVAN'S
SUCCESSOR HERE
Hon. John C. Rice of Caldwell, Ida.,
a wry promising candidate for the su
premo bench to succeed Judge Sulli
van. was in Blackfoot last Friday and
Saturday visiting friends who seem to
be legion. Mr. Rice enjoys the distinc
tion of being one of the most able and
honorable lawyers in this State. IIis op
ponent is Judge Robert Dunn of Coeur
d'Alene, but as Judge Morgan of the
supreme bench is also from the north.
Moscow, it would not lie fair or wise
for till* voters of the State to have two
north Idaho men oil the supreme bench.
Judge Sullivan is also a candidate to
succeed himself, but as lie lias been on
the supreme bench for the past quarter
of a century, ever since we became a
State, it is not likely that lie is at all
sanguine of being re-elected, and as he
is getting along in years and doubtless
well fixed fitinneiallv, his retirement to
private life would not offend him or
his former constituency very seriously.
"1 am a candidate for tile office of
Justice of the Supreme Court of the
Stile.
"1 have practiced law in the State
for twenty-five years. During that time
T have been impressed with the power
of the courts to affect the welfare and
happiness of all those who make up our
common wealth. Nearly every relation
in life may pass in review before the
courts, and all property may need the
sanction of tlieir decree.
"1 make the foregoing announcement
of my candidacy with due appreciation
of the high character of the service re
quired of those whom the people select
to take the responsibility resting upon
our highest court."
Mr. Rice is a lawyer at Caldwell, and
will probably be remembered by the
old-timers as an associate of former
Governor Steunenberg in the establish
ment of the first bank in St. Anthony.
Six years ago lie was a. candidate for
the gubernatorial nomination against
Governor Hawley on the Democratic
ticket. He is described by the people
of his home town as being a prominent
and eminent citizen.
As the nominations for justices of
the supreme court have by law been
made non-partisan in nature, the ele
ment of polities does not enter into
the campaign of Judge Rice. He with
others will have to go before the peo
ple at the primary unsupported by n po
litical party, and purely upon tlieir own
merits.

Bill department store at Pocatello, was

some luck.
