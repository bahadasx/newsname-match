entered his vessel at the custom-house
as a commerce carrier, and had pre

The German catpain submitted his
craft to a thorough inspection by the
surveyor of the port and an agent of
the department of Justice. These
officers agreed that there was on sign
of armament of any description on
board, and that there was no doubt in
their minds about the boat's being en
titled to the status of an ordinary merchantman.
The captain asserted that his voyage
had established the fact that a subma

could travel anywhere that the ordi

necessary. . He had no fears, he said,
of his ability to elude enemies that

OMNIBUS REVENUE BILL PASSES
HOUSE, INCREASING INCOME TAX
Washintgon, D. C. The administra
tion omnibus revenue bill, creating a
tariff commission, imposing a protec
tive tariff on dyestuffs, repealing pres
ent Btamp taxes and providing for new
taxes on incomes, inheritances and war
munitions profits, passed the house
late Monday by a vote of 240 to 140.
During the closing hours of debate
several amendments, providing for
elimination of the bankers' tax and
modifying the tariff commission sec
tion, were adopted over the opposition
of Democratic leaders.
The amendments cut the salaries of
members of the tariff commission from
$10,000 to $7500 annually; struck out
the provision under which no member
or former member of congress could
serve on the commission, and provided
single appropriation of $300,000 to
pay expenses or the commission the
first year, instead of the bill's stipula
tion of a continuing annual appropria
tion of that amount. The entire sec
tion levying a tax of $1 for each $1000
of capital, surplus and 'undivided
profits held by bankers was stricken
out.
Many amendments proposed by the
ways and means committee also were
adopted, including one under which
cigarette manufacturers must pay a
special tax of 3 cents for every 10,000
cigarettes.

be held in Portland has been fixed for
August 7 to 12, for the convenience of
Northwest merchants. Invitations are
ready to be sent to all the merchandis
ing trade territory, where Portland
jobbers and manufacturers maintain

out by the arrangements committee of
that city and it is intended to mix bus
iness and pleasure in most alluring
proportions. '

successful Buyers' Week of 1915, the
work of preparing for the 1916 Buy
ers' Week visitors will be in the hands
of the trade and commerce bureau of
the Chamber of Commerce, of which
Nathan Strauss is chairman.

Buyers' Week will attract a much
larger attendance than any of its three
predecessors.

each year, and the territory they rep
resent has spread, so that the annual

and east of the Cascades for a week of
profitable conferences.

thrown overboard.

make a much safer grade than that on
the road now in use.
