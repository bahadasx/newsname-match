Congress Wants to Know
Cost of Mexican "Campaign"
WASHINGTON. July L'O. -Democratic
congressional leaders today
demanded from officials of the treas
ury department an estimate of the
expenditures due to military move
ments on the Mexican border. The
estimates will form the basis for
legislation authorizing an issue of
"war ho nils" to cover the expenses
of the Mexican campaign.
Majority Uader of the House Kit
chin submitted an informal reqest
to Hec'y McAdoo seeking to deter
mine just how much money has been
spent and is likely to be spent on the
maintenance of the soldiers in Mex
ico and on the border. The bond is

these expenses from the time the

Interuatbui.il News Service:
WASHINGTON. July 20. Impos
ters representing themselves to be
otlicers of the I'nlted State public
health service have been obtaining
privileges and in some cases money
by appearing in several cities on the
pretext of making investigations in
connection with the epidemic of in
fantile paralysis, according to in
formation obtained at the health's
spriv'-c's headquarters here today. As
a result all officers and physicians
have been ordered to wear their
olive drab uniforms while on duty.
There have been severa' case of im
porters in New York city, it is st.it
ed. but the fraud is worked chiefly
in small towns.
Iocal authorities have become
aware of this situation in several
places, it wa stated, and mistaking
tl.e real onvials upon arrival, have
interfered with the performance of
their duties. The order requiring all
representatives of the service to wear
thir unforins is designed to prevent
fraud and also to prevent the proper
ofheera from being hampered in their
work.

sional leaders who have been figur
ing on a bond issue of $200.000,000
or $250.000.000 today were unable
to make any definite estimate of the
amount required.
The totut of the hond issue, will
depend to a large extent upon the
future course of the administration
regarding Mexico. If the present
military forces are kept on the bor
der and Gen. Punston maintains his
border partrol through the year, a
bond issue of half a billion may be
necessary to supply the funds neces
sary to finance the campaign. If an
agreement between the Carrunza
government and the United States
does away with the necessity for mil
itary service, $:,0t'.000.000 may cover
the expenses.
SUICIDE PACT IS
Authorities Now Believe Dr.
Celia Adams Victim of
Death Agreement.
BOSTON. July 20. A theory that
Dr. Telia Payne Adams, the Hrook
line osteopath nd central figure in
Boston's amazing love triangle may
hive died in a suicide pact, came to
day to add to the perplexing feat
ures which have made the whole
case the most remarkable in. Massa
chusetts' poice annals.
That a mysterious poison, not mor
phine alone, caused her death is the
police conviction following Medical
Examiner Magrath's announcement
of the results of his autopsy.
The internal organs taken from
the young woman's body have been
sent to an expert for analysis to de
termine the nature of the poison.
Dr. Clifford D. Harvey, the physi
cian tirst called in after Miss Adams
had been found unconscious, thinks
it very possible that she was the vic
tim in a suicide pact.
The police began a dozen in 'pi fr
ies alonu' as many different lines to-
dav in the hope of throwing some
light on the strange and puzzling
case.
Meanwhile Dr. Harris. AtwnoJ's
victim, lay in a critical condition at
City hospital. The physicians, how
ever, reported him resting comfort
ably with a slight chance to recover.
Winthrop Adams, 1 rother of the
dead woman, asserts that Atwood's
alleged confession as to I"r. Harris
having betrayed his sister is noth
ing but a "cowardly and dastardly
prevarication, trumped up to pave
his way for pubhe syp.pathv and a
.iter possible temporary insanity
plea to save him fium U.e electric

BRITISH BOYC
Demand For Retaliation
Against Blacklist Grows
Hourly in U. S.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON, July i!0. A flood
of protests from all parts of the
United States against the British
boycott was pouring in upon the
white house and the state depart
ment today. The action of Great
Britain in boycotting American rirm3
because they trade with England's
enemies, has aroused public senti
ment and demands for retaliatory
legislation were reaching here from
various commercial organizations
and individuals affected.
The state department is planning
action. It must wait, officials say,
a "reasonable time" for official noti
fication of Great Britain's action. If
that is not forthcoming, a direct in
quiry will be made at London.
Meanwhile, Acting i'ec'y of State
Folk is looking into the internation
al law bearing on the subject. It is
expected that all of the facts are
compiled he will take the matter up
with Pres't Wilson before framing
the planned protest.
Orxii (iun in War.
Officials very frankly say that the
making public of this boycott list.
Is, in their opinion, the opening gun
In what likely will prove a relent
less trade war against all neutrals
who have refused to accept without
protest the restrictions placed upon
commerce by the entente allies.
They point to the fact that the pres
ent boycott list was prepared by the
British board of trade and that it
has been operative for more than a
year, although only just now made
public, as indicating that the meas
ure is one planned by Uritis-h export
ers and manufacturers to regain
their trade lost by the war. The
making public of the list now. of
ficials helieve. was in anticipation
that at the end of the present great
drives on the eastern anl western
front, peace negotiations will assume
a derinite form.
No Plans for Retaliation.
While ortici.ils .are discussing re
taliatory measures no p!ar s yet have
been framed for such action. It ts
r.dinitted that the task is a knotty
one and the federal trade commis
sion and the department of com
merce will be expected to act. How
ever, an investigation now is being
made into one phase of the situation
that may lend itself to American use
in an eiroit to eufurt a change or
tactics.

New -Time Spe-i;d Service:
WASHINGTON. July L'0. Ap
proval by Mexico City authorities of
the tentative program outlined by
At ting Set 'y of tate i'olk and Am
bassador Designate Arredondo is
practically the only obstacle in the
way of the announcement of the
plans for the direct negotiations to
settle American differences with the
de facto government of Mexico.
These preliminary arrangements
had been held up until some idea
of the strength of the insurgents
movement in northern Mexico could
be gained. Officials here are con
vinced that there is not a foree of
revolutionists there so large that it
will menace the American border
through the inability of Gen. Tre
vino's army to cope with it. l'nles
some incident occurs within the next
week to cause the state department
to change its views on this matter,
it is confidently expected that an
nouncement of the program for the
proposed direct negotiations between
the United States and the Carranz.i
government will be made.
Withdrawal of the American
column ahl protection of the border
will be the first points of issue. Next
in importance will be the street se
cret consideration of plans for the
rehabilitation of Mexico with the
probable unofficial backing of private
bankers by the American govern
ment. MOVKS OX CHIIirAlllW.

"Pancho" Villa's fierce warriors,
fighting with all the fanatical
frenzy that is inspired by their rene
gade chieftain, closed in on Chihua
hua City today.
An advance hand far to the north
and west of Carranza's northern
headquarters city severed the gov
ernment's line of communication
late yesterday and' today the border
expected hourly the news that the
actual attack on Chihuahua City.
Every forte sent by (Jen. Jacinto
Trevino to .heck the onward rush of
the Yillista forces has either disap
peared completely, or has been
thrown back, cut to pieces and
routed.
Only 10 Miles Away.
The latent squad of alleged ar
riving reported Villa only 10 mile
from the city. Groups of Villa's
wild horsemen have appeared in the
hills within sight of Chihuahua City.
Carranza civalry has been sent to
drive them off. The latest cavalry
outfit that went into the hills after
a Villa bani has not yet returned.
The Carranza entrenchments along!
the San Pedro river on the edge of
Chihuahua City have been fired on
by other companies of Villa's com
mand. The remarkable mobility of Villa'
forces has always made them
unqiue military problem. With
Villistas on four sides of Chihuahua
City, Treviro would have his hands
full with dtfense even if the major
ity of Chihuahua residents were nor
Villistas anl ready to make trouble
from the inside with the .approach
of their chosen leader.
Villa Ix-ads Attack.
So swift has been the progress oi
his fighting men that Villa himself
is said to have corne from bis head
quarters on the Rio Florida bottoms
to lead the attack on Chihuahua
City. lie threatened to do this in
his latest communication to On.j
Trevino. At that time he also
warned Tre.ino that he would sack
the city ar.d execute all Carranza'
officers.
That Villt. is with the foremost of
his troops 'ns reported l the
wounded Carranzistas straggling!
back from I'alomas. where Martin '
Lopez led a Yillista band in an at- j
tack on a Caranzista troop train.'
