She was

Evelyn was an exceptionally
bright little girl, she had a sunny
disposition and was loved by all
who knew her. She was not
only the pet of family, but of the
neighbors, and her death is
mourned by all who knew her.
This beautiful bud was pluck
ed just when it was ready to
bloom and give off its sweet fra
grance. Her death has left a
vacant place in the home that
can never be filled. Her toys

be cherished by they that loved
Evelyn most.
Her family and friends are
poorer by her death, but Heaven
is richer. Every care was given
during her long illness that could
add to her comfort She bore
her afflictions with fortitude and
patience, and made a brave fight
for recovery, but the grim reap
er with his sharp scythe clipped
the brittle thread of life and her
spirit was wafted away on the
wings of love to God, who gave
it: and-her precious little body
was borne with loving hands to
the silent city of the dead, there
to remain until the general res
urrection. Woep not family and friends,
but be consoled with the thought
that Evelyn Is busking in the
sun-beams of God's love. May
Heaven's richest blessings be
the portion of all who loved her.

A Coirection
By mistake, in entering up
and transferring the claims
from the claim book stubs to the
fiscal court order book, one
claim issued to C. B. Woody for
(100. and one claim issued to
Chas. T. Riley for $175.00 were
entered of record twice, which
shows by the Financial state-
- Jm that these parties received
the amount of these claims more
than was allowed to them, when
in fact these parties only re
ceived the amount allotted to his
respective precinct, which was
$400 00. Leaffa Wilborn,

James M. Freeman, rural car
rier on route 3 has purchased a
new Ford Runabout to carry the
mail and parcel post for his pa
trons. Mr. Freeman besides
wanting to be there on time, is
a humanitarian and thinks", and
thinks rightly too, that such
weather as we are having is en
tirely too hard on a horse, so he
win put his steeds on a pasture
and pension them until the mud
makes it necessary to change
again. Ere long every rural
and star route carrier in the
county will use machines instead
of horses.
One of Our Oldest Citi
zens Passes Away.

born Jan. 20th, 1821; died. July
16 1916. He was married three
times. His first marriage was
to Mary Elizabeth McDowell,
Aug. 20 1842. To this union
there was born five children.
He professed religion when
young at old Wilson camp
ground, he and uncle Billy Lamb
professed the rame year and
both joined the Methodist cburch,
he remained a faitnful member
of that church until his death.
Uncle Linze was one of the
oldest men in the county at his
death, and lived longer than any
of the Travis family. He was
96 years and six months old lack
ing four days. Aunt Rachel
Travis lived 92 years and nine
months, Theresa Price lived 92
years and six months, Uncle
Harvey Travis lived 92 years and
three months, Aunt Elvira
Brantly was about 88 years old

Uncle Linze was a quiet, in
offensive man. He did a great
deal of public business, but
never meddled with business
that did not come before him
He was generous and hospitable;
everybody found a warm wel
come in his home. He was ap
preciative of any kindness shown
him. and warmly made you feel
that appteciation.
Compliment To Judge Gordon.
At the recent meeting of the
Kentucky Bar Association Judge
J. F, Gordon of this city was
elected vice-president represent
ing the First Appellate District.
This was indeed an honor worth
while and one we believe is de
serving, as Judge Gordon is not
only one of the best lawyers in
the state, he was one of the best
Circuit Judges in Kentucky. -

ECLIPSE OF MOON
VISIBLE HERE
Luna Five Hundred Miles Nearer
The Earth Than Ever
Before.
An eclipse of the moon was
visible in Marion Friday night
between 9:43 o'clock and 12:15
Saturday morning. At 10:50
four fifths of the moon's surface
was hidden. At the time of the
eclipse the moon was moving at
the rate of 2.2S3 miles an hour
while passing through the shad
ow. The moon was 500 miles
nearer the earth than ever be-
fore, and hence took a compari-
tively long time to pass, being
near the base of the cone of
the shadow. Because of the
nearness the tides were un
usually high in all parts of the
world at the time of the eclipse.
DOLLAR PROJECT
Kentucky Rural Credits Association
Which Was Incorporated Two
Years Ago, Is Collapsed.
Lexington, Ky., July 18.-FoI
lowing the suit for a receiver fil
ed two weeks ago by T. W. Hen
derson, of Dresden, Tenn., Rob
ert J. Colbert, of this city, waa
to-day appointed receiver for the
Kentucky Rural Credits Asso
ciation, which was incorporated
two years ago under the laws of
Deleware with a $1,000,000
capital stock.
This receivership marks the
collapse of the most ambitious
financial scheme ever attempted
in the south. There are 4,000
stockholders in Kentucky and
Tennessee and adjoining states,
who have paid in $375,000. Of '
this the promoters, Stanley
Watson, and 0. L. Vallanding
ham, of Kansas City, got $173,
000 as their share. There are
$136,000 held on good mortgage
loans and the remainder has been
spent for expenses since the pro
moters left here several monthi
ago.
The intention was to lend mon
ey on farms at low rate of inter
est on long terms. When form
er Govenor James B. McCreary
left office he was made president
at $5,000 a year, and other lead
ing men were made officers at
large salaries. McCreary and
some others resigned shortly af
ter the Tfnnesseean filed his suit
for receivers.
Offices were secured in the
city's largest building, and until
recently matters were apparent
ly on a highly prosperous basis.
Claude Mercer, an attorney for
the receivership, stated to-night
that agents of the promoters had
misrepresented matters.
