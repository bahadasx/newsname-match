Friy Harmony Can Only Be

9 Era 11 A. Berndt, Interviewed this
rnortlag on the subject of his atti
tude 'on resigning the chairmanship
of the Republican party, made the
-' following statement:
In view of misleading statements
that-have, been ma'de. I desire to em
phatically ' confirm previous state
ments io the effect that unless it can
; be arranged' to effect a reorganiza
tion of the central committee whereby
party harmony can be reached by hav
ing all elements in the - community
equitably represented, 1 am convinced
that my efforts would tot be attend
ed with success, and therefore feel
it Incumbent to tender my resigna-
tion in order that those responsible
for the present organization, and who
are in favor of continuing it, may
have entire control and the responsi
bility that goes with it
"I believe that Che committee was
fairly chosen, bo far as the voting
was concerned but without due de
liberation and that it will be readily
appreciated ' that the business com
munity, is not adequately represented.
Perhaps, the fault for this lies more
with - the . business community -than
anywhere else; nevertheless I believe
' it would-be wisdom- on the part of
these in control to see that it is given
representation..'! have naturally re,
garded that ' my greatest opportunity.
; for : service to the party ' would be
through securing the united support
V of the business people, and 'without
a fair chance of accomplishing' this,
my reatct means for usefulness has
'been 'cestr: : ;;..'
"Let those who Lelleve,lhat party
Ir.t rc-ts are i ar&nount give due
cc:.::-rt:ca ta the rights of all to
fair - reprcscntat.'cr' : - '
.Chairman Permit's , statement cor
reercnis precisely to the situation as
ou'Jir.ci by the tar-Bulletin yester-
' day afternoon. Since that time sev-
. eral "harmony - conferences" have
. taken place. John H.IWise, who was
prcrainent in the late platform con
vention, has worked particularly hard
to tring about harmony." ; ; ..
It Is conceded fcy all the party lead
ers, who have followed the develop
ments that the party is on. the verge
of a big split a split with the so
called business community, on one
. s'.-e and' the rank and file of old-
tine Republican voters on the other.
TredlcUons were made today, that
unless Chairman Berndt's attitude
brings about a reorganization of the
central committee, he and xrthers will
reiija and the substanttel Republic
ans who have almost always aided
the campaign in Ce past w ill decline
to have anything to do with the cam
palm 'managers selected by the com
mittee as it will then shape up. " :

'PROHIBITION CONVENJION IN UPROAR i
ST. PAUL, Minn, July 20. Efforts on the part of some leaders of the
national Prohibition convention here to get the resolutions committee's
draft of the platform adopted without distributing copies to the delegates
precipitated an uproar here today. For 10 minutes delegates stood on their
chairs, shouting, while Chairmain Patton vainly, pounded with his gavel "to
restore order. The motion to adopt the platform was withdrawn.
The platform as drafted carries nation-wide prohibition, -woman suf
rage, anti-preparedness and peace planks. An extract reads: "Mexico
needs not a conqueror, but a Samaritan. The Democrats have blundered
and the Republicans have evaded their responsibility in Mexico."
" The' appearance of William Sulzer, ex-governor of New York and a
candidate for the Prohibition nomination, caused a demonstration.
