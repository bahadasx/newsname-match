Vegetables and
Plants
This is the time of year that nearly every
one has more than plenty of vegetables in
his own garden or at least should have; it
is our earnest opinion that every family
should have a good home garden plot, not
only for making a material saving in the
cost of living, but also for the healthful ex
ercise a well kept garden demands; it also
developes a joyful disposition in seeing the
things grow, especially with the children.
But. alas, gardening has more trials and
troubles, more things to contend with, than
any other occupation and here is where we
come in. Through our years of experience
and specializing in this line of farming, we
are able to steer clear of good many ob
stacles, are right there wth the goods in
season and our goods are

We believe in the thorough goodness of these
suits. We have judged them by careful comparison
and actual tests and we know that at
$18, $20, $22, $25
we are giving men more for their, money in these
clothes, than is possible in any other make at the
same price. . '
We know also that these suits could stand a
higher price. We know that on inspection you
would pay three to five dollars more than we ask,
and you would get your money's worth. But this
store never wabbles in its decision to give greater

pigs or ponies or engaged in some open

When the writer, in the company of

"Rut cntna nn " aaifi Mrs. Sunday.
as she carried her boxes of precious
fruit up to the house, we will go and
find Dad. He is off tending to the wa
ter or helping with the hay."
There is no confining Billy Sunday
and his wife to the four corners of a
closed room in the summertime, when
thev are enjoying tne spienaors oi me
Hood River valley. The visitor is
taken on lone walks over the meadow,
down to the barn. He is shown the
nnnlea tha thickens and the Diss.
Verily, Rev. Sunday is a believer in
the open air. He has just naa csrpen

Tha floors are neat as kitchen tiles of a
fastidious housewife. You have heard
about how hogs get their feet in the
trough. Nothing like this happens out
on the Sundsy ranch. Contrivances of
Mr 4iindav'a nwn BllPffestlOll have
been installed to keep the troughs
clean. When Mr. Pig has finished his
bran mash, the gates lift over the rood

But the emphasis of tho sentence be

hnohmiaa haa individual aieemns corcn-
es for its porcine occupants. No hogs
ever had Hiich an onourtunitv to lead
clean, healthy lives as those fat, con
tented porkers of the Udell district.
And thus Mr. Sunday spends his
summers. From daylight till nightfall
he is pottering aooui tne piace. rut

there All nf his thouehts are for the
comforts of his animals, and more so
for the tenants of his place. his nan-
brother, L. U Heizer, is me reai
farmer of the Odell place. But not
manu farmera have the nrivilece of en
joying as comfortable quaretrs as those
provided lor Mr. neizer. raucn 01 nn
work is done like that of the chauffeur
nf tha 191R model automobile. He can
just press buttons and turn faucets and
do a lot ot tne worn mat require more
physical effort on the ordinary fawn.
A deep well, orovided with the latest
pumps, lifts the domestic water of the
rancn piace to nugo iim act mnom.-

under pressure in pipelines. Roses and
vegetables, tiower gardens ana meau

but soon his mind wanders away to
other things. Suddenly he will quit
discussing the meeting at Kansas city
and tell you to look at mat nne pony
his boy Paul's saddle animal.
"I siant tn set awav irom every

himself in just those woras, out id

Rev. Sunday and his family will re
main here for several weeks. About
the middle of August they will leave

September 10 a series of meetings will

Since ministers of Portland, Ore., re
cently tendered Rv. Sunday an Invita
tion to preach in the Rose City, he says
. . . i rr i I i i
mat sucn oners nave ueen mauo vy
every city of any consequence in the
unnea aiaies.
Uillu Sunrlou Hnea nnt taka vers
kindly to the Portland invitation. At
least he doesn't discuss it with enthus
iasm. In fact, he makes the flat state
ment that be will never go to Portland.
"it is a bard city, be says, not witn
the meaning that it is sinful, "it is
hovil tn linn nn tha different faetinna.
They have tendered this invitation and
and have done nothing toward getting
ready for a meeting. What's the use
of going to a place unless you have
everything lined up lor you and every
body behind you?"
The evangelist says that be has'de-
clined to go to New York to hold a
series of meetings.
"No, that talk of trouble with the
labor unions has nothing to do with my
decision. That's hot air, sensational
newspaper talk. Why the unions are
among my best friends. In every tab
ernacle in which I have ever preached
ever nan nas oeen ariven uy union ta
bor, every board has been sawed by a
union carpenter, every bit of the liter
ature 1 have issued has the union laoei.
That so called opposition among the la
bor unions of the country does not
come from unions as a whole. It eman
ates from some of the organisations
allied with the brewing and distilling
lnmineaa (Vrtninlv thev have been
hollering their heads off, but just let
mem nowi.
Mr. Sunday gives as his reasons tor
tnrninu dnwn New York the statement
that the committee wanted him to talk
in Madison Square Garden, "the place
a a . ilti ! 1 1 t
is too solan, tie says. it win oniy
seat 12,000 people. I wanted a larger
tabernacle, and when the question oi
tiuiiaing it came up, me committee got

iho a tangie.
When Mr Knndav arrived in Hood
River last year he was suffering from
a nervnna hreakdnwn. There were
crow-feet lines around his eyes. .Today
ne is apparently in perieci neaun.
"Have vnn ever Given anv thnuirht

am going to keep right ahead preach
ing and taking my summer rests just
as 1, have been .doing. When I am
worn out I guess 1 will have to quit,
but that time doesn't give me any
bother."
Perhaps the casual visitor and ac
quaintance will not notice any differ
ence, but in the inner circle of the
Sunday family this year there is a
feeling of loss, of sadness. For the
first time since the Sundays have been
afcntamed tn anend their Hummer va

suddenly with heart trouble. '
"Death came easily tor her," says
Mr. Sunday. "It was on Sunday morn-

thought she was asleep, but her eyes
were closed fnr the last time.
"We carried her body to the old

she was laid to rest in the old family

of C. V. Hodgson, have come here
from eastern Oregon. They are en
gaged in a correction ana cnecaing
over of high points of the country, by
which a triangulation and measure
ment of land is made by the section
and quarter section system.
I nnk r lut mountain, a neak iust east
of Mount Hood, is used as the base of
operations of the government men in
their local survey, rsv means oi

tions are obtained at night. Aboard
one of the motor trucks ia a tbeodoilte,
an instrument used in measuring hori
nntal and vertical ancles. Onlv three
of these instruments, acccording to Mr.
Hodgson, are owned oy the service in
which be is engaged. To prevent an
injury to its delicate mechanism, a
hesvy silken tent is carried along, and
this is placed over the tbeodoilte when
in actual use. ,
"Very often," said Mr. Hodgson,
' hava heen forced to take down
nur tent and instrument, because of
the high wind that has accompanied the
recent stormy weamer. -
The coast and geodetic crew will re
turn here and visit Larch and China-
dire mountains. They will visit Port
land, and later return to Salt Lake,
conducting observations en route. From
Salt Lake they will proceed to southern
California.
While here Mr. Hodgson visited an
old schoolmate. Prof. J. W. Critea.
principal of Hood River high school.
While a quorum was not obtained at
the meeting, so unanimously favorable
was the vote of the large number of
members of the Apple Growers Associ
ation Saturday afternoon that it is an
assured fact that the board of direc
tors of the Association will proceed
immediately to take formal action in .
affiliating with the Fruit Growers'
Agency, ot Spokane. The Association
board of directors, at was announced
by President Davidson, were unanimous
in their recommnedation of an affilia
tion. Already 24 of the most promi
nent aalea BDenciea of tha Northwest
had affiliated with the central agency.
Hood River was the last large district
to join, its growers and board of di
rectors having held aloof because of
certain bylaws of the central agency
being in conflict with theose of the local
organization. Following a number of
meetings between the local board of
directors and representatives of the
Growers' Agency, the latter organiza-
tinn'a hoard nf truateea adonted amend
ments proposed by the Apple Growers
Association.
Capt. Paul H. Weyraucb, of Walla
Walla, Wash., president of the central
agency, who was here to address the
grjwers.stated that the tonnage turned
in for assessment by growers and aalea
concerns already affiliated reached 7,300
cars. The affiliation of Hood River will
add an additional 1,200 ears of fruit.
"The Growers' Agency," said Mr.
Weyraucb in bis address, "is not a
sales agency, it win not aeu one oox
of fruit, aa many seem to have errone
ously thought. One of its benefits will
be derived from the crop estimates,
market information and other data
that it will accumulate working with
representatives of the government.
The task of securing all of this data
was too expensive for individuals or
single agencies. A campaign to secure
uniform grading, packing and handling
rules in the four Northwestern fruit
states, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and
Mnntana will he waced. A meetiiur
for the discussion of standardisation
measures will be held in North Yaki
ma in September. 1
"We will also investigate community
systems of packing. We will require
our members to adopt aystems of aales
accounting that are essentially similar,
thna makiiio' it nossible to make com
prehensive comparisona of the prices
received by the different agencies.
"We will also derive great benefit
from the power we will be able to
wield as a collective body in securing
readjustments of freight ratea that
will be beneficial to the northwestern -fruit
grower.
"We will cooperate in the opening
up of Canadian markets and a foreign
outlet for more of our product."
Mr. weyraucn corrected me impres
sion that the Agency was to be super-
vised by the government.
"It was formed," he stated, "along
lines suggested by the Office of Mar
kets of the United States Department
of Agriculture and the Federal Trades
Commission, and it will work with
government officials in securing valu
able data.but hereafter its government
will be maintained exclusively through
action of its members."
M Ulmirmixh stated that the annual
maximum cost to growers would be
$100 per carload of fruit.
"We have already collected, "he aaid.
"the sum of $2,300 from initiation
fees. Our budget, as already made,
reaches a total of $8,500. More than
this amount will be derived from ton
nage assessments."
H. F. Davidson, who addressed the
meeting, characterized w. ti. rauina
uius, of Puyallup, as the man respons
ible to a greater extent than any other
for the success ;of the Fruit Growers'
Agency. . '
"Last summer," said Mr. Davidson,
"Mr. Paulhamus, in his capacity of
president of the Northwestern Fruit
r.miuN r.nnncil kent hammerinff on
this proposition along the lines that
have been adopted until the government
lent us a hand and promoted the organ
ization ofhe Agency."
The board of directors of the Growers
Association held a special meeting yes
iA.ri.ti nhan thev acted on the unani
mous vote of the grower members of
the organicatioa, who expressed their
willingness of affiliation with the Fruit
