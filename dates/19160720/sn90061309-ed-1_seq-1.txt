METHODIST
It was hot liitt Sunday, the hot
est day we have had for a long
ime. and the people i,re to be com
mended fir coming oat to the vari
ous hoars of worship. We had
1 It! in S. S and a large congrega
tion at the League service Next
Sunday I will continue the same
theme: "The Power of Thought."
Next Sunday night will be the final
program of the League contest. It
has been good thus far and especi
ally, the last service. I consider
this one of the best programs ever
rendered in a contest and the other
side is coming back next Sunday
night with a rich program to coin
pete with it. There will be things
given that have have not been giv
en thus far in the contest. As to
whether they can beat the program
of last Sunday night. I cannot say
but one thing I can say, and that
is the object of the contest has been
won, namely, creating a lively in
terest during the hot summer
months. Think of it, from 200 to
300 at a Young Peoples service?
Thir is wonderful! It is not gotten
up for sides or factions, but for the
League, and I know the entire
church has felt the benefit of it.
My, but it was hot in the parkier
vie I had a time trying to preach
out the congregation was large,
and I trust some good done.
