JUI'IE M.AlHER TO RETIRE.
That he would not qualify for re
election, and further that he intend
ed entering private life at the ex
piration of his term, was in sub
stance a statement made Tuesday
morning by Judge Thomas F. Maher.
for the past twelve years jurist of
the Second City Court, in Algiers.
Judge Maher said that he would
not enter the race to keep peace
within the ranks of the party; that
he has failed in the endorsement for
re-election and therefore realized
that a fight for the office would be
fruitless. M. S. Mahoney. who has
made the rae for the office before,
qualified Monday with James C. Hen
riques., chairman of the Orleans Par
ish Democratic Committee. Thus far
he is without opposition, although it
is believed another candidate will
make a fight against him. Mr. Ma
honey, however, is well known in Al
giers and has man' friends.-Daily

road strike some seven years ago.
lie Is a man of 58 years of age, a

JUST A DYING DOG.
Mangled and moaning, bloody and
In Its slow death atgonies, a dog lay
Saturday night by the street car track
on Patterson street, crowds of men,
women and babies watching sym
pathetically as the little creature
struggled in its long-drawn out death
throes. Now and then it kicked, then
its head went up, then dropped near
the rail to be bumped a bit later by
the trolley car.
Some kind-hearted man at length
got a long pole and pushed it away
from the rails, but no one--not a by
stander, not an officer (no officer hove
in sight for a spell) had authority to
end Its agonies, for that power was
vested solely and exclusively, as the
police people at the Algiers station an
nounced later, in the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The
minutes sUpped by into hours before
the offielals ot first and last authority
hove in view.
And they were the only ones who
had the power to end the helpless
creatUre's awful agonies without pay

endleh.-- danger and in every condition
of weather--these are the true sol
diers of industry. These men should
not need to ask for better conditions.
letlter conditions have been given
them years ago.
President Wilson has said that the
workers have a right to say under
what conditions they will work. The'
railway .employees merely ask that
the public' ap{,rote their effort for a
reasonable condition.
The so-called "averag. wages" of
railroad employees quoted frequently
by the carriers to show how highly
paid is this class of labor, are so un
reliable that the Interstate C'onmiuerce
Commission itself has served warnine
that they are not to be trusted. Yet it
is on the basis of these figures that
the carriers are spreading the impres
sion that railroad wages are high.
Engineers in freight service are con
sidered by some people as highly paid.
but strange to say they rank below
fourteen other trades in wages. If
readers are in doubt of the honesty
and truthfulness of these statements
look up the re,.ords on labor for your
selves.
Hoping the public will become in
terested and attend some of our pub
lic meeting, which we intend to hold
in the near future throughout the city,
giving notices later of the time and
place. I am. your truly.
