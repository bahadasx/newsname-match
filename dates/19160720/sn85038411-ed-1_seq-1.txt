First steps toward what may prove a settlement of the dif
ferences between the striking carmen and the Harrisburg Railways
Company, were taken this morning when a number of the strikers
met with President Frank B. Musser, and conferred over general
conditions for more than two hours.
Immediately after the conference President Musser stated that
the men met him as old employes and individuals and discussed
grievances and misunderstandings, and as some of the men had to
leave another meeting will be held to-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock.
Protection Inadequate Says Musser
President Musser stated shortly after 1 o'clock this afternoon:
"We have men to operate the cars and will put them on the lines as
soon as we are sure of adequate police protection. The new men
on the cars are trained and have been warned not to carry any deadly
weapons. I have invited Sheriff Caldwell to make a search.
"The notice given the striking employes this morning was a
formal one effective at noon. We must fill up our crews if they
do not return. 1 do not think that any more cars will be placed on
the lines to-day, as several of the ones being operated were so badly
damaged that they were sent to the barns and others substituted.
"The police are not giving us adequate protection. At Market
Square this afternoon a crowd collected with an officer within fifty
feet of them, but no effort was made to disperse the men until
more than 50 had collected. Sheriff deputies saw one man hurl a
stone through a car window, it has been reported to me, but made
no arrests."
David Cassel, dispatcher for the
Railways Company, reported this aft
ernoon that while piloting a crew to
Twenty.third and Deny streets, a mob
attacked them at Twelfth and Market
streets, in the presence of deputies,
one man, according to Mr. Cassel,
hurled a stone througn the car win
dow, but the deputies made no attempt
to arrest the offender. At Fourteenth
and Derry streets another mob threw
stones and fruit at the crew, the men
narrowly escaping serious injury. On
the return trip a similar attack was
made. An officer who was there at
the time grabbed a boy who threw one
of the stones, shook him. and then left
him go. According to the dispatcher
the deputies were apparently afraid
to make any arrests.
Hugh L. McLaughlin, one of the
striking carmen, who attended the
conference this morning, issued a
statement in regard to the meeting

Week-end Holiday Dur
ing August
Harrisburg stores generally will be
closed Saturday afternoons and even

This has been decided upon in order
that the sales forces of all stores may

a Friday afternoon off they were com
