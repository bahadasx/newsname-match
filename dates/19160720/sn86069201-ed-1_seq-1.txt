THE REASON WHY.
Why is It that 11ATSON & WEST

BECAUSE they buy for CASH and sell

BECAUSE they take all discounts.
BECAUSE they have the lowest rent.
BECAUSE they have no clerks to pay.
BECAUSE they do their own work.
THAT IS THE REASON.

RURAL CREDITS
ASSOCIATION FAILS.
The Kentucky Rural Credits Associa
tion, of which former Governor Me
Creary is President has gone Into the
hands of receivers ard it is thought that
the stock holders will not get more than
twenty percent of their original invest
ment. Of the $373,000.00 collected as cap
itol stock only $1315,000.00 remains, and
this sum is invested in first morgageson
farms. The losses of the company seem
due to mismanagement, chief I v in allow
ing a 25 per cent commission to agents
who sold stock. Claude Mercer, one of
the directors of the Association, had the
following to say in regard to the failure.
"You may say for me", "that there
has been a great fraud committed some
where, and I believe that some of the
money can be recovered".
'The original promoters are to
blame" "as they went into it only as a
money making scheme, I think the
whole thing should be probed and all
persons hit who need hitting. The
theory was practical, but the commis
sion contract knocked the thing in the
head. The conduct of the officers of
the company is in no wise responsible
for the failure of the company."

COMPTON CAP
TURED IN ILLINOIS.
Uncle Dave Ross returned from Lin
coln, III., Sunday with Hayden Comp'
ton. who escaped Irom jail here in
March. Compton had previously been
convicted on a number of counts on the
charge selling whiskey. He was per
haps the most open handed bootlegger
who has been convicted here in years,
selling almost to anyone from bis
apple wagon." Since his escape,
Uncle uave r.as been trailing every
clue in his cllorts to catch him, and
about a week ago, he was located at
Lincoln. Armed with extradition
papers from Gov. Stanley and acconv
pauied by She'ilT Tom Ballard Uncle
Dave hnd no trouble in securing his
arrest.
Compton has evidently told quite
different story than appeared at his
trial here, for the following ridiculous
article appeared in the Uloomington
Paragraph.
'Charged with breaking jail in Gar
rard county, Kentucky, W. Hayden
Compton, father of ten children, was
Brrested by Deputy Sheriir Ollie Al
berts on a farm in Eminence township.
He will bo returned to Kentucky.
Compton war churged with unlawful
sale of liquor. If the story told by
Compton is true, and it is borne out by
his wife and brother, with whom Coinu
ton had been living since coming to
Logan county recently, the proceedings
are somewhat out of the ordinary.
Convicted alter his indictment on the
charge of selling liquor In dry territory,
Compton was fined $300 and sentenced
to 100 days in jail. It Was understood
between himself, the sherilf ot Gar
rard county and the county prosecutor,
Compton declares, that If he paid his
fine the jail sentence would not be en
forced, provided be left the county.
Compton paid his fine, ho says. He
was placed In jail at 10 o'clock at night
and the door of his cell was left open,
he declares. Four hours later lie walk
ed out unmolested, he says, and de
parted.
Compton has been working at the
carpenter trade. After his arrest here
on the Information from Kentucky he
asked to be taken to his wife. lie then
gave her a check he had just received
for carpenter work. Mrs. Compton
and ten children arrived in Logan coun
ty from Kentucky only last Monday."
