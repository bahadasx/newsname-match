(United Press sta'ff correspondent.)
Auditorium, St. Paul, Minn., July 20.
William E. Sulzer of New York re
ceived a great demonstration when he
addressed the prohibition national con
vention this afternoon. In an address
lie said he "was not a candidate" but
intimated he would accept a nomiua
tion.
Prior to Sulzer 's arrival, Hanley's
nomination seemed assured. Sulzer,
seeking the nomination, largely npon an
attempt a stampede of the convention
inter m the day. Meanwhile Sulzer
forces in the platform committee sought
to inject an anti-Catholic plank into
the platform.
Sulzer did not come at once to the Au
ditorium when he reached the city. At
liis hotel he issued a brief statement
saying he would be "elad to acceDt the
leadership if the party desired." He
said, however, he bad not come on his
own desire to force himself on the con
vention, but at the invitation of man'y
prohibition members.

Eugene W. Chafin, former prohibition
candidate for president conferred with
Sulzer at his . hotel as to the advis
ability of his Attempting a stampede.
Sulzer said if he was nominated by
the, prohibitionists he also would be
nominated by the "American party,"
an anti-Catholic political organization,
and will poll 2,000,000 votes.
Sulzer pointed with pride to his own
Tecord and brought cheers when he told
the crowd how he stood in religious is
sues. Incidentally, he said, he thought
under some circumstances, - he might
get more votes than Wilson or Hugies.
"The more you know about me, the
more you'll like me," Sulzer aid.
"The more I'm abused the more votes
I'll get."
An attempt to "steam roller" the
platform through the convention for
adoption without having it printed or
further time for consideration, met with
determined opposition and threatsh of a

its adoption iu formal course of or

Wave of Murder, Suicide
and Other Horrible Crimes
Is Sweeping
The Hague, July 20. (By Mail) A
wave of ghastly murders, suicides and
other crimes of horrible character, is
sweeping Berlin.
Mental depression or insanity, due
n some instances to the loss of rela
tives in the war and in others to lack
of proper food, is held to be resioiisi-
ble by t.ermnn criminologists. During
the past few weeks a sensational mur
der or suicide has occurred nearlv ev
ery other day in Berlin. Many of
these are being hushed up and others
get but scant attention in the Berlin
newspapers,
because of the overwhelm-
ing interest iu the war.
Two girls robbed another in a Ber
lin manicure shop a few days ago. To
escape, arrest they tried to hang her
from a chandelier. She pleaded to be
cut down. Thev let her body drop
when she became unconscious and cool
lv hacked ber head almost off with a
razor. Then they packed th) body in
a trunk and shipped it to another city.
The girl murderers wore caught and
sentenced.
. A brief item in the German papers,
under the caption: "A love drama,"
revealed a murder in a wealthy Berlin
home. A young Russian, who had liv
ed in Berlin as the servant of a Ger
man for seven years, became infatu
ated with the daughter of his employ
er and desired to marry her. She re
fused him time and again. One Sun
day morning while she was alone Hi
her bedrom, the Russian entered, lock
ed tiie door and sprang at her. She
escaped his embrace after a struggle
and ran into a closet, locking the door.
The Russian fired one shot through
the door without wounding the girl
and attempted suicide, shooting him
self in the head. The girl's brother,
an army officer, who was at home on
leave, heard the snots and ran into
the room. The Russian seized a pair

PRESIDENT IN STAND
Navy Must Not Be Used to
Enforce Demands of
Speculators
Washington, July 20. Referring to
what he called "the new born policy of
guaranteeing American investments by
the Amberican flag," Senator Robert
La Follette, progressive-republican of
Wisconsin, in the senate this afternoon,
said: .
"If that question is made tho issue
of the campaign, the people of the Uni

La Follette was insisting on bia
amendment to the naval bill that none
of the battleships be used for the col
lection of debts owed American bond
holdetrs or concessionaries in foreign
countries, when Democratic Whip Lewis
asked:
"Then you would approve the Mex
ican policy of President Wilsont" ,
"Most emphatically, yes," answered
La Follette.
"I hope the republican candidate
will not endorse the proposed new born
policy that when an American investor
buys a concession worth $1,000,000 for
a tenth of that sum, the American'
flag and arms shall be used to see he
collects full faae value on Jus apeeula
tion,
"The president said in Detroit he
would not use the United States army
and navy for such a collection agency.
"If that question is made the issue
of the campaign, the people of the Uni
ted States will vindicate, the president
most emphatically."
La Follette was engaged in a spirited
donate witn senator Mraudcges of Con
necticut..
"What has happened," he demanded,
"that we should increase our military
appropriations from $429,000,000 last
year to $840,000,000 this yeart
"All reason the other way. The oth
er countries of the world are losing
their battleships, killing their men by
millions. By their own acts they are
making it impossible for them to men

San Antonio, Texas, July 20 Not one

all the armies of Europe in tho past
two years ever worried as Borne of these
American soldiers along the edge of
Mexico. These Americans 1 refer to are
worrying nbout their families back
home; they don't know whether their
wives and children have enough to eat.
Much a deplorable condition could not
possibly exist in any European army,
for European governments care for the
families of the soldiers.
The American government does not.
I talked with hundreds of soldiers of six
different armies in Europe. I talked
to Europeans in artillery pits, trenches
and dug outs, but I talked with the
American in a jitney going from Son
Antonio to the army post.
If the Germans knew Britishers were
treating the families of their soldiers as
we are treating ours, or vice versa, the
fact would be blazoned world-wide as
an indication of governmental cruelty
by the enemy. It's not cruelty on our
part, only oversight, and the lesson
we've learned has cost uuhappiness
and embarrassment in many American
homes.

from Frank Shepkowski, ray first Amer

(United Press staff correspondent.)
With the British Army in Northern
France, July 20. Every, foot of the
new German positions behind the lines
captured by the British north of t
Somme is being carefully - and slowly
drenched with a destructive fire of Bri
tish high explosives in preparation for
a new attack. , ,,
Giant British shells are now. drop
ping upon German works from guns sta
tioned miles to the rear. British artil
lery pieces of large and small calibre,
acting in unison, are. systematically
pounding the new German first lines.
Tho roar of guns is continuous and
resembles the heavy roll of thunder. The""
Germans are replying only occasional
ly. Either they arb seriously out of guu
or are short of ammunition. British air
craft, without molestation, are direct
ing the fire of the artillery.- Since the
beginning of tho Anglo-French "push"'
German aircraft have been surprisingly
absent. . - .: . . ;..
From a height a short distance in the
rear, British aircraft have obtained an
excellent view of Freycourt, Contal
maisoa, Mametzvillage, Mammeta wood,
Bazentin-.eGrand and other psmtfona
recently conquered by the British, later
our party traversed the valley of the
Somme and entered the ruins of . Frey
court; once a German stronghold, but
stormed and captured by the British,
early in their great offensive.
Imagine a giant steam roller passing;
over any American town of 3.000 in
habitants and you get an idea of Frey
cour today. The little French ; town
has been literally wiped off the map.
German dugouts and shell holes repra- '
sent the epike holes of a huge .steam,
roller. The rest of the town is flattened
in debris. Here and there, from the
hole of a battered German dugout,
comos a sickening steuch that tells of
piles of corpses.
The scene at Frey court is typical o'f
that in any of four villages Hotted out
by high explosives.
High British officers say that the
purpose of the British offensive is not
speed but to recover by slow, steady
pushes, every yard of invaded French,
and Belgian territory lit a minimum ex
penditure of human blood and by a
heavy expenditure of high explosives,
of which there Is an ample supply.
Fighting must go On below as well' as
above ground. The Germans have eata
combed all villages to escape shell fire.
At Bazmitin-Le-Grand, for instance, the
underground caverns sheltered 13,000
men.
The entire Anglo-French front iu the
Sonnno offensive is, as far as the eye
can see, literally inarming with men
and matoriul.
