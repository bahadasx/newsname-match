Ft. ran!. Minn., July 20. An effort

When the convention opened at 0:45
a. m. lianly managers predicted his
nomination on the rirst ballot, this aft
ernoon and expressed confidence in
th( ir ability to withstand Sulzer's ex
pected effort to stampede the conven
tion. Efforts to effect adoption of the reso
lutions committees' draft of a plat
form without first printing and dis
tributing copies to delegates, this noon
precipitated the first hely outbreak
of contention among delegates at the
prohibition national convention. Ad
vocates of immediate consideration and
adoption of the proposed platform re
ceded from their position under pres

For 10 minutes the convention was
in an uproar, delegates standing on

taken amid a bedlam of noise and dis

Nation-Wide Prohibition Kavored.
The proposed plattorm, which
caused the first row of the sessions,

by an'i preparedness and peace planks,
keuprocal trade treaties with foreign
nations and a federal trade commission
W : pccialists were recommended.
Taking up the Mexican situation,
tie piaflonn dc hired the "democratic
party has blundered and the republi

"Mexico needs not. a conqueror but
a p,. sarnaritan," the platform de-
land. The plank on free institutions
dei iared for "absolute separation of

American Concern Affected by Brit

New York, July 20. Eur-iness and
banking firms here have not yet de
cided what they will do regarding the
action of the BriJsh government.. i u
jdacing them upon its trade bhicklist.
Many have put their cases in the hands
of the merchants' association and the
secretary of that organization is now
in Washington conferring with gov
ernment oOicials. There was talk to
day of calling a meeting to discuss a
plan of united action ami engage joint
counsel but no definite course of pro
cedure has been agreed upon.
Some of the men in the list express
ed resignation. They said they had
expected this action for several
months.
K. L. Dunn, head of the Pan-American
association, which includes sev
eral hundred concerns doing business
in South America, said that an attempt
had been marie to keep American firms
with British affiliations from having
business relations with the black-listed
houses. He said he had been told
of the black-liat more than a month
ago.
William Se hall, Jr., of the banking
nad shipping house of Muller, Sc hall

Washington that members of his firm,
with bur. one except ion are citizens of
the United States, he was told that the

Baltimore, July 20. Prepared
to leave port any moment, Captain
Paul Koenig, commander of the
Beutsehland, put on lus uniform
today for the first time since he
landed here 1 1 days ago and for
several hours this morning studied
the charts of the Patapiscn river
and Chesapeake bay with Captain
Frederick Hansch, commander of
the "orth German Lloyd liner
etkar.
When Captain Koenig went back
aboard the undersea liner he took with
him a duplicate manifest of the ship's
cargo.
Captain Koenig said he would not
leave his ship again and indicated an
early departure but would not say just
when.
It was understood the Deutschland's
mac hinery had been finally tested and
placed in order for the trip.
Baltimore, Md., July 20. At dawn
today the screen of tugs and barges
was drawn about the submarine mer
chantman Deutschland, indicating that
she would not leave here for several
hours at least. To all appearances
she-was ready to start on her return
vciyage to Germany last night. This
morning just before she was hidden to
view it was observed that she was sub
merged to about the same depth as
w hnn she came into this port with a
full cargo.
All night the tug Timmons played
its searchlight over land and water
covering approaches to the pier
where the Deutschland is berthed.
Toward midnight the vigilance of
the German guards about the pier
tightened. Several launches were
found hovering about the waters near
the submarine and, while th" Timmons
threw its searchlight beams upon the
strange craft, the night superintend
ent of the Eastern Forwarding com
panv, local agents of the submarine's
owners, jumped into a motor boat andi
made a long tour of the waters about
the pier to inspect the mysterious vis
itors. POSTMEN ELECT

RAILROADS f

To Increase Rapidity of Troop Move,
ments t, " Coaches Should be
Added Kxperts Attest.
Chicago, July 20. In order to move
the maximum number of troops on
short notice, the railroads of the coun
try must have 6,750 more cars perma
nently at the call of the war depart
ment, according to W. J. Black, pas
senger traffic manager of the Atchi
son, Topeka and Santa Ee railroad in
a statement here today. Such an in
crease, he said, would allow the move
ment of 1,750,000 troops within 4S
hours.
The railroads, Mr. Black says, now
have a surplus of about 8,000 passen
ger cars. With 50 men to a car these
would accommenlate 4uO,oOu. Includ
ing 2,500 sleeping cars of all kinds.
87,500 additional, or a total of 4H7.500
men could be transported a tone time
without disturbing commercial busi
ness. Mr. Black declares that while
if all passenger and sleeping cars in
the I'nited States were used at once
1,750,000 troops could be transported,
it. would be impracticable to abandon
all commercial trains even in time of
war. At least 50 per cent of the nor
mal traffic would have to be maintain
ed. On that basis, he says, available
equipment would enable American
railways to move only 5u0,000 troops in
4S hours.
