BLISS APPROVES

Ready for Fight or
Frolie.
By ROBERT H. ROHDE.
McAllen, Tn.. July 1*> cheadquarters
?th Field Division, U. S. A.).-The New
York National Guard, scarcely two
weeks on the border, but already
housed in sanitary camps and settled
down to the routine planned to make
them fit for hot, hard service. passed
Major (Ieneral Blis-'s inspeetion with
flying colors to-day.
General Bliss, assistant chief of staff
of the United States Army, and per?
sonal representative on his present tour
of President Wil?on, had spent the
night at Mission. There he was waited
on early in the morning by Major Gen?
eral John F. O'Ryan, leading a pro
v-Monal equadron cf cavalry as honor
escort.
The 2d. 14th and 69th Infantry repi
ment?, comprisinf- the 1st Brigade,
were first inspeeted. The first two com
mands were comfortably encamped. The
newly arrived 69th, thanks to their pick
and s^iovel experience in the prepara
tion of Camp Whitman, had gone along
with the work of camp making so well
that an exclamation of praise was won
from the inspecting general.
But that hardly compensated for the
loss of their commander. Colonel Louis
D. Conley, who was taking leave of
his officers and men even as the Bliss
cavaleade trotted through camp.
Shortly after two major generais
had ridden westward toward McAllen
Colonel Conley and the staff and line i
officers of the 69th had a fareweil j
runcheon in the Mission Hotel.. It was
an occasion far from jovful. The voice
of Father Francis P. Duffy. chaplain
of the regiment and spokesman for the
officers, trembled more than once as
he addressed himself to Colonel
Conley.
*'\Ve can't bring ourselves to con?
sider this a final parting, sir," he said.
-hat us call it an episode in your life
'hat vou are ordered to the rear a
man fit to be at the front if ever a
man was. I do not need to tell you
how loyally the C9th would have fol?
lowed you into action. Although we
cannot follow you home,^ it will be
your spirit that guides us."
The colonel sat with head bowed,
profoundlv affected.
"lt is neither necessary nor proper
for me to express an opinion on this
case " he replied after the officers had
toasted him. "I can only say I am
clad I have been able to leave thej
regiment as I do, for news that I could
not qualify physicaliy came to^ me as
a shock. But loyalty to the 69th ia the
foremost consideration. This evidence
of mv officers' regards touehes me |
deeplv how deeply I cannot tell you..
"Though I may not be with you as l
colonel. rest assured my interest in the ;
regiment does not end here. There Ifll
one wish uppermost in my heart as 1
take leave of the ?9th may the "fneer ;
who succeeds me as your colonel be the
sort of man who will not take it amiss
if I come to see how my boys are get
ting along."
The ofticers marched soberly to the
-tattwn and sent a chorus of cheers
and "God bless you'" after the after?
noon train as it carried Colonel Conley
away. A few minutes later they were
rheerinf- again, this time for Major
Michael T. Lyneh, who is to be in tem?
porary cpmirmnd until a commander
from the "outside" is chosen.
On thi* outskirts of McAllen, General
Bliss and GflBflral O'Ryan arara met by
a battery of tield artiilery, which fired
? salute of thirteen guns. The in>pec
tion of the McAllen camp was made in
ji*- time, for everything waa, as it had :
been for many days, in apple pie order.
Practieally all General Bliss was
called upon to do was to auggest a I

brothers near Malines before the out?

The M^rchants' Association of New

of the Nataional Gunrdamen from the

ground that the mobiliiation of the

been a failure.
The report of the committee, of

[Bf TflffT?rh to Tr*;* Tritrjn* ]
Baltimore, July 19. With all its men
aboard, the conning* tower closed and
the two spars drawn inhoard the sub
marine liner Deutschland seemed ready
at 11 o'ciock to-night for a dash
through the gantlet of British war- I
ships.
Near the slip lay the tug Thomas F.
Timmins, which brought the l'-boat up
the river. Outside were clustered
numerous launches of the Eastern For- '
warding Company, forming a patrol on
the river side of the slip. A newspaper
launch was greeted with the hail:
"Keep off. You're interfering with
our plans."
All day there had been evidences that
the hour of sailing was t.ear. Seamen
had been bidding goodby to their
friends ashore, telling them that all
shore leaves w-ere cancelled at sun
down. The guar.l about the pier was
stronger than usual and strictly en
forced the order that no strangeri J
were to loiter about.
Forty Tons of Oil Aboard.
More than forty tons of fuel oii wer?
pumped into the tanks of the Deutech*
land late this afternoon. When the tw?
tank cars were swttched to the sub
mersible'a pier an official of the com?
pany explained that the oil was in?
tended for the Bremen, whose arrival is '
expected shortly. B.eiore sunset, how- j
ever, the oil was aboard the Deutsch
land.
Two hours before the usual time for ]
the day shift to aait the stevedores, j
who have been working day and night ,
for nearly a week towmg away the car- I
go of rubber and nickel, were paid off
and left the pier.
Spread N'ets aa Trap.
Reports came in that the warships
had lengthened their line and strewn
? he depths of the sea with great nets
whieh might catch the submarine and
entangle its screw.
Fuch nets have been used with deadly
effect in the I'hannel and along the
Scottish coast. There have been
stories of r-boats thus tr-apped i
which have not been found for many :
days, long after their air apparatus
had failed. It is said that new ships
which have joined the waiting squadron
off the capes have enahled the BritiflB
to lay a veritahle maze of the nets.
The stories have inspired some mis
givings in the hearts of the Deutsch?
land's crew, both as to their own safety i
and the fate flf the Bremen. a sister
boat whose arrival is expected at any
moment. I'ntil the shore leaves were
withdrawn and other signs of im
mediate departure became apparent. lt
was thought Captain Koenig would not
sail until the Bremen had arrived and
he had conferred with its commander.
Crew Tells of Terror.
That the stories of the huge nets
apread for them have caused real BBJC*
iflty among members of the Deutsch?
land's crew is apparent from the tenor
of the conversations some flf them had
with their friends at parting.
"We are praying every night anda*-'
our friends to pray for us," Karl
Fruechte, second engineer. is quoted nn
telling a friend.
"Eataaglfld in these nets," Fruechte |
friend continued, "the submnrine can?

fear. They talk of it contmually when
they come to see me at night, and thev
ask every one to pray for them. It is
not the cannon, but the ne's that may
trap them at the bottom of the sea."

Washington, July 19. Technicallv
the I'nited States cannot protest the
British blacklist of American firms
rublished yesterday in Lrondon Gov?
ernment officiais admltted that much
to-day.
Yet this further step in interferenee
with American commerce already haa
had a political effect that will go far
toward offaetting whatever advantage
the British ma* derive from the exer
ciae of their right.
In the laat two daya there has heen
a complete change in the Administra
tion's attitude toward Great Britain.
From a condition of "protesting toler
ation," as the Germans describe the
Frcsident's course, the I'nited States
ha? been roused by a series of pin
pri.-ks to the necessity of taking a
atrong stand on what it regards as
I'ritish infringement of its rights.
I F.ngland haa gone too far. Adminis

I.an-lng Studying Care.
Seeretnrv Lansing. while on his va
cstion, is studying the caae against
Great Britain. This includes, in ad
cition to the British reply orjr. tha
blockade?delivered on April 24. and
to which 7he I'nited States has not vet
made answer -the protest on the seit
uro of American mails and British ex
tension of the contraband list
In all the protests to Britain since
the beginning of the wnr. it was point
ed out to-day, the I'nited States has
made no progress. Invariablv Ameri?
can complainta have been received with
the greatest rourtesv, and promises of
relief have been made. and in many
instances individual redress hen been
granted. The settlement with Chicago
packers and the Wilhemina <*ase are
examples. But all these have been
purely informal. Polite and firm, as if
to sugarcoat the pfll. the British have
made no "eoneessions" whatever to
the American government.
Even in qu.-stir.ns like thf holding up
of Red Cross supplies destined for
Cermanv. in which the I'nited States
has onlv a humanitarian interest, th?
Stete Department has been equally
helpless in as.sailing the British ban.
This situation has rankled consider
ably with an Administration already
sensitive on its foreign policies. But
while the controversv with Germany
laste.l the President felt it better not
to romplieate one issue with another.
rspeeially as Berlin made constant ef?
forts tr- confuse the issues.
Obstaclea to Settleroent.
Even after the settlement of the
I'-boat issue, Germany made impos
sible any immediate sction on the
blockade by the implication that her
own surrender was so conditioned.
Mexieo and the political conventions
next combined to prevent an aecount
ing with Great Britain.
Now, the extension of the "trading
with the enemy" act until, as officiais
declared to-day, it amounfs to wide
restraint of American commerce has
presented a fresh reason for dealing
with Great Britain. Thf British For?
eign Office has given the President
the very opening he sought.
With his Administration on the de
fensive heforr* the Hughes campaign,
one of the weak spots in the Presi
d"nt's armor has bepn his failure in
dealing with the British blorkade. In?
deed, in the opinion of a Senator 4vho

and point of junction betwten the lines of the Central Powers in the
northern aad aouthern aectaors of tha Eastern front. They may stnke
i c>ouh over the Carpathiana for Hungary, and they may strike for
Demberg.
It is impoBsible to 8ay yet whether the Russians have decided to con
1 centrat* on any one of these three possibilities or to continue aiming at all
' three. Certainly the latest news indkates that they are pressing up the
Carpathian Passes, but in what force we cannot even guess. Cone.iv

The little sketch map which accompanies this article will illustrate

Czar's Forces Advance in
Three Thrusts Along
Front in East.
(Bf c*hl* ui Th* MflBfl")
Lor.don, July 19.-The attention of
military crities here is focussed on
three aectors of the great Eastern front
_on three distinct offensives by the
Russian armies.
In Volhynia and Galicia the Russian
thrust ha? for its double aim the capt?
ure of Lemberg and Kovel. Along the
northern line south of Riga Kuropat
kin's forces aro attempting to prevent
von Hindenburg from weakening his |
own lines to assist Mfl hard-pressed
fellow commanders to the south. Along'
the Carpathian front the Czar's troops.
are trying to clear a road -or several
roads into Hungary and its rich !
plains.
Suerces on Three Fronta.
In each of these three drives to-day
the Russians won new successes. On
the extreme southern front they made
the most important advances. There
they were variously reported as having
entered the Carpathians, as having
aetually penetrated a day's march into
Hungary, and as merely threatening
the Austrian rear guards in the moun?
tains. What is important is that Gen?
eral Letchitsky has taken up the right
with renewed vigor and is exerting a
powerful pressure on the enemy's lines
in the part? leading to Hungary.
There seems to be little doubt that
the Russians have gained command of
the Jablonitza and Kirlibaba passes,
the ehief highways into Hungary on
the southeast. and of the strategically
important railroad from Delatyn to

London, July 19.?The British are
rolling back the German counttr at?
tack, slowly, but with the unflagging
steadiness that has marked (ieneral
Haig's whole strategy in the Picardy
offensive.
Along the two miles from Bazentin
to Longueval the fury of the battle
is unabated, with the tide turning in
favor of the British. Both sides are
sustaining heavy losses, for the Teu
ton assault is the strongest counter
thrust they have attempted since the
Allies began their push on July 1.
Pounding hard after their pre
paratory attack with thousands of
asphyxiating and tear producing
shells, the German left wing last
night foreed the British to yield some
ground in the Delville Wood and in
the northern outskirts of Longueval.
Britiah Regain 4,round.
Haig's troops struc'.c baok to-day
and succeeded in wrestir.g from tha
enemy most of the ground he had
won last night. The quickness with
which this territory was regaineri
seems to indicate that the strength
of the German counter attacks is
waning.
The German aystrm r.f defence re
quires heavy counter attack?. Driven
from their first and second lines, and
with their l.acks to the third line de
fending the approarhes to the Albert
plateau, the time has come to ma*K?
the greatest effort to block the road
to Bapaume.
Germans Loee Initiatiie.
That effort the Orman*- hegnn yea?
terday. At first they succeeded in fore
ing baclj Haig*. lines, but they could
not hold their gains The iWperate
fighting continues, but the initiativa
again has passed to the British.
The Longueval sector was the most
feasible spot at which to launch th.s
counter attack, on which ao much ie
pends It stands on high ground domi
nating the eountry to the north. It la
near the buckle of the Anglo-French
armor, and has been the acene of very
heavy fighting, including the bloody
battle of Trones Wood.
At th* easternmost tip of the Britiah
wedge the Germans a'tacked, hurling
masses of man at the oppoaing line,
both from the north and from the eaat.
If the front can be foreed back here the
advance af Pozieres, at the other end of
the line, will be senously hampered. If
the 'ip of the wedge ia blunted, tha
British driving power will be decreaaed
considerably.
Germans Fail at Waterlot.
While the tightmsr was proceedinf la
the Delville Wood the Germana con*
centrated great numbera of men for an
attack on the Waterlot farm, lying to
the east of Longueval. These were dia
persed by the British fire.
The British made several attacka in
the Ovillers aeetor on their left flank,
where they are pushing toward
Fozieres. But their greatest effort haa
been to repel and to turn the German
counter attack. I'ntil 'he deeision haa
heen reached on the right flank it ia
hardly likely that a new thrust at
Bapaume will be attempted.
Meanwhile the heavy bombardment
from Gommecourt to the sea forecaata
a British blow af another point without
long delay. The fire of the Belgian

Artlllerv lluela at Verdun.
Before Verdun there has been no
infantry artion, but the heavy guns ara
keeping up the duel. The Crown
Prince's next move at Verdun ia
awaited with almost ai much intereat
in London aa in France.
There are indications that Germany
is almost ready for another despereta
gamble. Thrown on the defenaiva for
the first time in many months by tha*
attack along the Somme, a new and
successful asaault on Verdun would
brare. the (ierman army and curb ria

pie. The venture on the Meuie, long
under way, will be earrmd through ta
triumph if it ib humanly possible. Tha
attacka of the Crown Prince, regard

of that. The moral effect. ahould
