Everything is For
the Best
Sometimes wc are inclined to disbelieve this but
nevertheless it is true. Even this hot weather is for the
best. It kills weeds and makes crops ftow. It rids our
bodies of impure matter by means of perspiration, It is
sent as a punishment to the laz and a blessing to the
good,
Even Buckley's Store is for the best. If you don't
believe it, come around, inspect our prices, and sec if they
are not the most reasonable in town. Our goods are the
best and freshest to be obtained, If you don't believe it,
just give us the chance and we will rove it.
EVERYTHING IS FOR THE BEST
And the Best of Everything is at
BUCKLEY'S
BUSINESS FAILURE.
E. S. Fuller, proprietor of the
well known Uncle Fuller's Va
riety Store, in this city, July 8th,
filed a statement with the referee
in bankruptcy at Cape Girar
deau, Oscar Knchans, and asked
that he be adjudicated a bank
rupt, and was declared as such
on July lnth.
He listed as follows: Assets
$3155.00; liabilities $2021.37. He
states that the difference between
these items represent the worth
of the furniture and fixtures in
the store.
In a statement to the Herald
he said that he and his family
were not extravagant, and had
used every means to stem the
financial tide. And that the fail
ure he accredits to a lack of
capital to continue until better
times or fall.
Uncle Fuller, as he is known
by most of his friends, is a hus
tler and is always on the move,
and it cannot be said that his
failure was caused from him not
doing his part.
Not only a few months ago
Hayti suffered a very disastrous
fire and among the buildiugs
burned was the Fuller Hotel. In
that fire Mr. Fuller lost several
thousand dollars. When Mr.
Fuller came to this city several
years ago he owned considerable
property, today he is iiat, and all
this with himself and wife in de
clining years. It seems that
losses after another had heaped
upon him until he was over
loaded, thus the result.
The many business and other
friends of Mr. Fuller are sorry
to see him in this position and it
is hoped that he may yet stem
the tide after awhile and again
have something for himself.
Geo. Terrett and sou of Hay
ward was visiting friends and
attending to business in Hayti
Saturday morning. He motored
down in a new automobile.
Mrs. Mary Weaver, an old and
respected lady of the Dowd
Gayoso neighborhood, died early
Monday morning.
