BOARD ACT
Constitutional Question Probably
Will Not Be Ruled on by
Supreme Court.
WALLACE SUBMITS
EXTENDED BRIEF
Attorney General Linde Rests
Case on Appropriations
Argument.
{rhf.fiupceme ctiurt in handing down
ff&rllecisionon the tax commission
cape will probably not rule upon the
constitutionality of the act creating
it. A decision in this matter would af­
fect. the legality of the -Award of re­
gents and the immigration commis­
sion, as well as the tax commission.
Attorney Q'pheral Linas yesterday
in presenting-jU| aide ot th-? case ig­
nored t^pKi i"e sult, asking
that a Compelling State
Auditor ^rgenson to credit the tax
commission with the 1911 appropria­
tion, instead of the 1915 one, and sub­
mitted his case on tii9 grounds that
the 1915 appropriation snould &tand
and that even if it didn the commis­
sion was not entitled to $2,400 addi­
tional for a secretary besides the
$6,000 appropriation annually tor clerk
hire.
Pleadings Raised Question.
In the pleadings of uie attorney
general submitted to the court, Mr.
Linde declared that tin act creating
the tax commission was unoonititu
tional, this statemen being based on
the fact that the same act created :be
commission and provided Tor its main­
tenance.
Gfeorge E. Wallace, representing the
tax commission, submitted an extend­
ed brtef upon this p^a^e ot the ques­
tion, hut Mr. Linde chose to rest his
fase on 'the. other points.
Wallace Argues.
Mr. .Wallace contended that the ap
tjroprtatijBi 'tna1e inthe* Act-of 1911
should stand, because the approprla-
Hon made in i915 was mace when the
•fegislature believed that thiB member
"phip of the tax commission would be
changed, from three to one, and it was
therefore made for a tax commission­
er, an altogether different proposition
froni the tax commission. The su­
preme court has already sustained
'Mr. Wallace on this point, it having
allowed the 1911 appropriation for
'"1
-I?*
•4
Commissioners to stand. Mr. Wallace
•urged that the same ruling should ap­
ply to clerk hire.
In answer to the contention that
$6,000 was all that the commission
was entitled to for all employs, In­
cluding the secretary, the attorney
argued that the Ac of 1911 providedd
for $2,400 for he salary of secretary,
besides the $6,000 for the salary of
the other employes.

Washington, July 19—The Nation­
al Association of: Postmasters heard
addresses today by a score of speak­
ers, headed by Postmaster. General

tal problems and developing numer­
ous digressions into partisan politics,
rhich drew a reprimand from Post

Prospects of one-cent letter postage
were outlined by Mr. Burleson, who
did not touch on political subjects. He
said that should second-class mail'
rates be increased, the cost of mail
transportation lowered under the new
•pace payment system, and 'useless
extravagance" in rural carriage be
eliminated, individual steps could be
made next year toward reduction of
the letter rate. His reference to the
letter rate was taken to indicate that
the department was planning the ad­
justment of charges on magazines
and similar publications.
CLEAN UP, SAYS DR.
STRAUSS MAKE BISMARCK
THE CITY BEAUTIFUL
Dr. F. B. Strauss, health com­
missioner, yesterday inaugurated
an aggressive campafgn to have
all vacant property and all con­
taminated used property cleaned
up in accordance with the city
ordinances.
Many complaints have been re­
ceived by the commissioner.
"All weeds in yards, vacant lots
and on the boulevards," says Dr.
Strauss, "must be removed. Let's
get together and make Bismarck
the city beautiful."
The health commissioner also
suggests that all piles of litter
be treated with formaldehyde or
chloride of lime. This will pre­
vent them being a breeding place
for flies.

Piedras Negras, Coahulla, Mexico,
July 19.—Senorita Oralia Salinas
Carranza has gone to Monterey to for­
get a certain gringo.
She is a niece of First Chief Car­
ranza, and he is Sherwood Moe, son
of a wealthy resident of Gary, Ind.,
and brother of the pretty senorita's
college chum at Notre Dame.
A few days ago Senorita Oralia
danced with glee and read to her
brother, Alberto's wife this telegram:
"Will be in Piedras Negras in Ju­
ly.
"SHERWOOD."
A few days later Senora Alberto Sa­
linas Carranza read this headline in
La Democrata of Piedras .Negras:
"El Presidente Wilson Ya Ha Llam
ado Los Soldados de Los Estados!"
"President. Wilson has called out
the state militia," remarked the sen­
ora to the senorita. "Pues! Didn't
you tell me your Senor Moe was a
member of the state militia?"
"Yes," said Senorita Oralia "yes."
And then a thought struck her, and
her eyes flashed.
"Is that the way he's coming to
Piedras Negras!" she exclaimed. Well,
St. Paul, Minn., July 19.—The nom­
ination of J. Frank Hanly of Indiana
as the presidential candidate of the
Prohibition party was confidently pre­
dicted tonight by the organization
forces in the Prohibit ion National
convention, following the unanimous
re-election late today of Virgil G. Hin
shaw, Chicago, to he chairmanship
of the national committee.
Further impetus was given the Han­
ly candidacy by the selection of Rob­
ert H. Patton of Springfield, 111., as
chairman, leaders of both forces ad­
mitted. Howard Kerschner, Topeka,
Kan., was named permanent secre­
tary.
When the convention adjourned to­
night a conference of convention offi­
cers was held for the purpose of ar­
ranging a program to be followed at
the final adjournment.
Will Raise Question.
Advocates of the Hanly candidacy
succeeded at the afternoon session in
obtaining the adoption of a recom­
mendation of the rules committee pro­
viding for the nomination of a presi­
dential candidate tomorrow, instead
of on Friday, but later a motion pre­
vailed for reconsideration of the con­
vention's action. The question will
come up for a decision. on the floor
of the convention tomorrow.
The Indiana delegation at its clos­
ing session agreed upon* the proposal
of Sumner W. Haynes to place in
nomination the name of Mr. Hanly,
but at the same time agreed that
MEXICAN FIRST CHIEF'S NIECE EXPECTING VISIT FROM
INDIAN AN WHEN HE IS CALLED TO NATIONAL GUARD
COLORS AND LEAVES FOR BORDER.
.. r"V'
he will be lucky if he reaches Piedras
Negras—and he won't meet me!"
So this will explain to Mr. Moe
why he is persona non grata just now
with the senorita—although he didn't
expect to be called out and really he
didn't moan it that way at all.
"Just think!" said Senorita Oralia
to her sister-in-law, "'he might come
here to shoot down Alberta—my bro­
ther—your husband the wretch!
'Will be in Piedras Negras in July.'
Well, I'll just bet he won't!"
Alberto, the brother, is chief of the
Mexican army aviation corps and a
graduate of St. John's Military acade­
my, near Syracuse, N. Y.
This is not the only international
romance threatened by the possibil­
ity of war. All through the border
states are families that will be split,
if war comes—brothers serving in the
Texas or New Mexico national guard,
while another brother's sympathy is
with Mexico. And many are the Mex­
ican girls in the United States torn
by love for their naative land and for
some tall "Yanqui" in the border
staes' militia who may be called upon
at any time to shoot down their kins­
men.
Hanly's Nomination on
Prohibition Ticket Is
Predicted by Delegates
each member of the delegation would
be at liberty to vote for any presi­
dential candidate.
Hold Mass Meeting.
A public mass meeting was held to­
night. The convention will resume
in business session tomorrow. The
unanimous re-election of Mr. Hinshaw
as chairman of the national commit­
tee was the feature upon which the
Hanly adherents riiade their confident
assertion of supremacy in the conven­
tion. They pointed to the fact that
'Mr. Patton's election as permanent
chairman as corroborative of the com­
plete unionism of the convention
forces.
•Mr. Patton is one of Mr. Hinshaw's
closest friends and as a member of
the executive committee of the na­
tional commite he helped the com
mitee in the selection of Daniel Poley
as temporary chairman when the ex­
ecutive committee several weeks ago
split, 5 to 4, on the question.
Charge Steam Roller.
WSth Mr. Patton in the chair, the
Hanly program met new obstacles at
the afternoon session. Some dele­
gates charged Patton with steam roll­
er methods, declaring that he failed
to recognize several delegates who
sought to speak against a certain mo­
tion. But he had the great majority
of the delegates with him and there
was no effort to change any of his rul­
ings by an appeal the convention.
Mr. Poley, a Hanly supporter, nom

It was stated officially that the

firms doing business in the United
States under the terms of ihe trading
with the enemy act is being delayed
by the state department with the ex­
pectation that Ambassador Page at

port does not arrive soon, the depart
iment will sta*rt an inquiry, which, in
turn,' will be referred to the iBritish
American office.
Watching Developments.
At the state department today It
was said every development was be­
ing carefully observed and there were
some intimations that Gre'it Britain's

friendly. Hitherto, representations in
behalf of American firms placed on a
blacklist have resulted in the removal
of their names.

ican firm on condition that it shall
not reach England's enemies, can be
obtained without difficulty on the
open market in the United States.

La Follette Makes Vicious
Attack Upon Plans for
National Preparedness
Washington, July 19.—An attack by
Senator LaFollette on the general
preparedness program as the product
of money interests, aided by the met­
ropolitan press, prevented a final vote
in the senate today on the naval bill.
The Wisconsin senator had not com­
pleted his speech when the senate ad­
journed tonight ind did not indicate
how long he intended to continue. The
belief was that a vote would be reach­
ed tomorrow.
Most of the day was taTcen up by a
fight between Senator Oliver and
Senator Penrose on the settlement
of the $11,000,000 government armor
plant. By a vote of 51 to 17, the sen­
ate defeated a motion to strike out
the section and then voted down, 49 to
16, the Oliver amendment to refer the
armor controversy to the federal
trade commissioner for settlement.
Senator LaFolIete contended vig­
orously that neither conditions con­
fronting the nation nor the testimony
given before he congressional cotnmi
tees warranted the proposed navy in­
creases.
Tax Load.
"A' total of *44,000,000 fs the load
that goes on the bended backs of the
American people," he declared. "Why
is this to be done? If it is necessary
I*,*.
now why was it not necessary four
years ago? You knew then what was
the naval strength of all the countries,
but the interests had not been ap­
pealed to then.
Bethlehem Steel at 40 was not Beth­
lehem Steel at 840. The interests be­
hind this preparedness plan do not
fear Germany or England. The plan
merely sifts into their imperialistic
schemes."
Attacks Motives.
The senator charged that men had
been forced into preparedness parades
under stress of having their wages
reduced. The larger newspapers of
the country, he declared, were influ­
enced by the advertising of "the inter­
ests" behind the preparedness propa­
ganda, to devote more space to the
testimony of witnesses Terore the con­
gressional committees who favor pre­
paredness.
"A cheap skate of a business man
can get a column and a half on the
front page if he will boost prepared­
ness," he shouted, "but Ceneral Wea­
ver, who speaks against it cannot get
a line. These newspapers sell their
editorial good will along with their
advertising. It costs something to
say that, but for some years I have
been ready to pay the price."
