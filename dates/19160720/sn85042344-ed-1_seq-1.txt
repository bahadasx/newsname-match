on the governor and hi.i underlings,
Lyon accepted the printing. Hn then

the senate dK-feated a motion to strike

refer the armor controversy to the

vigorously that neither conditions

MARSHALL FIGHTS
CONTEMPT ACTION
Files Application for Stay
of Execution in House
Proceedings.
I?W YORK. July 19 United
States Attorney H. Snowden
Marshall, technically in the custody of
the sergeant-at-arms of the house of
representatives tonight after bis writ
of babead corpus preventing his re
moval to Washington to answer for
alleged contempt of the houso was
distnisHed by Federal Judise Hand,
announced he would at once file an
application for a stay of execution
which would enable him to appeal
to the supreme court of the United
States. Should tho stay be refused
Mr. Marshall will go to Washington
voluntarily
Judge Hand held that the house
of representatives acted within Its
rights in voting Mr. Marshall in con
tempt on the groun I that his crl'.i
eism of the house was made public
during an Investigation Into charge
against Representative Frank Illicit
nnan and others because of their con
nection with the labor national peaco
council. This organization was al
leged to have fomented strikes In
pli-nts inaniif icturiiK munitions for
the entente allies. Tbo decision con
tinued :
"1 am, of course, aware that tlia
implications of such a holding are to
make it possible for the house to
treat as a contempt crlticUni of its
conduct, pending impeachment, hy the
press generally. Such a power in
volves the possibility of abuse like
every other power, especially when
1n the hands of one who is ut once
the Judge and the victim.
"On the other hand. It must be con.
ceded that the absence of such power
puts the house at tho mercy of a pub
lic pressure that may at times actu
ally prevent a fair a-id impartial de
termination of an Individual's rights.
It may be better that such offenses'
should come before a separate tribu
nal unaffected by the string of per
sonal Insults, but there Is at present
no sui h tribun.tl "
