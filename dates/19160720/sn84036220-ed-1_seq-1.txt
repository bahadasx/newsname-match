This community was shocked as it
seldom has been on Sunday morning
when the news of the sudden death of
Hon. John D. Wuite at his ranch near
Utica became known. Mr. Waite left
for the ranch accompanied by his
daughter. Miss Judith Waite, Tuesday

his accustomed health and spirits and
busied himself about the place as us

to bed and nothing was heard of him
until along toward 11 o'clock, when he
went to the room where Mrs. Don
Waite and Miss Judith Waite were and
complained of being ill, directing them
to bring him certain medicine, which
was done. He then laid down on a
lounge, and, as it became apparent that
liis condition was growing worse, Miss
Waite undertook to call up the resi
dence in Lewistown and notify her
mother, but could not get the connec

rapidly to Moccasin, calling up from
there, but, of course, before then Mr

STILL FIGHTING HARD
in Brief Dispatch General Haig An
nounces That the British Fire Had
Dispersed the Germans Massing for
a Further Attack on Waterlot Farm,
Which Confirms Opinions Constant
ly Expressed by Correspondents at
the Front of the Dwindling Strength
of the German Counter Attacks.
Rain Impedes Other Operations.
LONDON, July 19.—(11 p. m.)—The
British troops have recaptured in the
village of Longueval and Delville wood
most of the ground taken by the Ger
mans Tuesday night according to the
British official communication issued
tonight. Hard fighting is still in
progress in this region.
LONDON WAR REVIEW.
LONDON, July 19.-11:10 p. m.)—
When General Haig's afternoon report
was dispatched from headquarters in
France the violent fighting which, de
veloping from the German counter at
tack, had been going on all night and
had given the Germans a footing in
Delville wood and Longueval, still was
in progress. The German attacks on
the Waterlot farm and other points
were repulsed.
in a brief dispatch tonight General
Haig announced that most of the
ground thus lost had been regaired in
both places and that the British fire
had dispersed the Germans massing
for a further attack on Waterlot farm.
These dispatches seem to confirm the
opinions constantly expressed by the
correspondents at the front of the
dwindling strength of the German
counter attacks.
The operations on the French front
are still impeded by rain and com
parative cairn prevails.
The Russian operations again are
becoming interesting. The Russian
military critics dwell on what they de
scribe as "the mechanical regularity''
of the strategic and tactical blows
dealt by Russia on her various fronts
and the absence ot any indications
that tho enemy forces are able effect
ively to parry them.
The recent Russian successes have
brought them much nearer Vladimir,
t'olyniski and Kovel and the German
communications between Kovel and
Lemberg are threatened by the Rus
sian advance to Stoyanoff ant) Sokal,
f idiminary to the investment ot Lem
berg.
In Transylvania the Russians have
olrpined two important eastern passes
in the Carpathians, Jablonitza and Kir
libaba, wh'le they also hold command
of the Delatvn-Budape-t railway. Their
cavalry ig moving in the rear o' Gen
eral Pflanzer's forces between Kimpo
lung and Kuty, and apparently their
invasion of Hungary has begun.
According to one report, a Russian
force already is one day's march into
Hungary, threatening the Austrian
rear in the mountains. The Russian
advance also continues successfully in
Asia Minor and It is teportod from
Rome that the Turks again have eval -
uated Kermanshah.
Waite had died, ulthough this was not
known until later. 1km Waite had re
mained at the shearing plant for the
night and the two ladies were alone at
the house with two guests.
Mrs. Waite and Dr. A. C. Biddle went
out early in the morning and Under
taker George Creel went out along
toward 4 o'clock, bringing the body in
Sunday morning.
His Career.
John D. Waite was born at Perrtl

had served as republican national com
mitteeman and was intimately ao
attainted with the national and state
leaders of his party.
Prominent In Masonry.
Mr. Waite was devotedly attached to
the principles of Masonry and had de

terests of that great order. He was

CHARLES FOLLIOTT, OF THE
GUTHRIE COMPANY, LOOKING
AFTER G. N. WORK.
CONSTRUCTION ENGINEER TAFI
R. E. Taft, the Great Northern engi
neer of construction; Charles Folliott,
president of Guthrie & Co., contrac
tors, and Mr. McCullough, another
construction man. arrived here Thurs
day coming over from reat Falls
and joining Capt. A. G. Riley, vice
president of tlie Guthrie company, who
arrived a few days ago.
All of those men come here in con
nection with the Great Northern's
plans for resuming work at this end
on the New Rockford-Lewistown cut
off.
The visitors will make a general
survey of the situation and it is ex
pected that work can bo resumed here
within a reasonable time. The track
will be constructed to the long tunnel
seven miles east of town to facilitate
the handling of material there. At
the tunnel tho big job of removing the
bench will be done with the aid of
steam shovels and everything will be
run by electric power. It is thought
that this work can lie completed in
six months and in the meantime work
on the line between Lewistown and
Grass Range will probably he taken
up. As already stated in these columns,
the Great Northern and Milwaukee
tracks will occupy one grade from a
point, a little beyond Grass Range to
Winnett and on the Musselshell river.
A couple of years will witness the com
pletion of the whole cut-off and open
up direct communication from New
Rockford, N. 1)., on the main line, to
Lewistown and on to Great Falls.
Milwaukee Cut-off.
The Great Falls Tribune, in referring
to the Milwaukee cut-off Thursday
said:
"With the completion of the Choteau
line of the Milwaukee, officials of that
system expect to see the Great Falls
Missoula cut-off pushed through next
year, especially since a stretch of about
25 miles of this line is now under con
struction up the Big Blackfoot valley
and the steel has already been laid
on the Great Falls end to its junction
with the Choteau line."
The Great Northern people are not
losing any time in getting tilings go
ing at this end. Sunday a crew be
gan driving piles across Spring creek
near the flour mills and Monday work
was resumed on the long tunnel.
Dirt Will Fly.
It is proposed to complete the grade
from til's city to the tunnel immediate
ly and get tlie track down. This Is
necessary because of the immense
amount of material that will have to
be taken to the long bore. All tills
was arranged for during the inspec
tion here by Charles F. Folliott and
Capt. A. G. Riley of the construction
firm of A. Guthrie & Co., and It. 10.

Heving that such a system of cam
paigning is not conducive to the wel
fare of tlie organization."
The resolutions were referred to
committees and will not be discussed
before the convention until reports
are made upon them. The election
referred to i s the referendum vote
for officers of tlie federation, which
has been completed, and the votes in
which are being canvassed at tlie

Tlie same delegates presented reso
Itiiioiig calling for Bn investigation as
to why the seceding local unions of
Clifton, Morenci and Metcalf, Ariz,
are permitted representation in tlie
Arizona state federation of labor,
thereby having affiliation with the
American Federation of I>abor.
They presented also a resolution
demanding that the referendum elec
tion of officers lie held following the
biennial convention of the organiza
tion instead of just preceding it, as
at present. These resolutions went
to committees.
The count of votes for officers is
proceeding slowly, and will not lie
completed before late tomorrow.

VILLISTAS ATTACK TRAINS
EL FASO, July 1ft- Six govern

ista attack upon n Carranza supply

that a band of about 50 outlaws un
der Nicolas Hernandez also is oper

CONGRESSMAN JOINED WITH
OTHERS OF THE MONTANA
DELEGATION IN THIS.
IS CONFIDENT" OF BEATING IT
The receipt of a letter by Secretary
ltlieeni of the Helena Commercial club
iron! Representative Torn Stout, regis
tering his opbjectlon to the proposed
ax on the copper industry, completes
:lie expression of tlie sentiment of
Montana's delegation. Senators Walsh
ind Myers and Representative Evans
::ad already replied to the protests
■.cut out by Helena and other lilies
i broilgliont the state.
Mr. Stout denounced the proposed
levy us unjust and palpably discrimi
natory in that it affected Montana's
greatest single industry and allowed
dlier commodities to go unlevied. The
Lewistown editor-congressman stated
ills willingsness to support a tax on
copper provided other commodities
were treated the same, believing that
Hie copper producers would be willing
o share the burden brought on by the
heavy preparedness'program avilh oth
ers.
All of tlie Montana delegation are
now in the midst of a hard fight to
sway sentiment in the senate against
'lie proposed tax. News from the
national capital lends encouragement
to their tight, and it now appears cer
tain Hint the provision levying a lax
oil copper, will be defeated h ythe sen
ate.
Stout Swamped.
Congressman Stout received many
protests from all over Hie Treasure
date against Hie copper tax. His re
ply to tlie Helena Commercial club's
protest was as follows:
"1 beg to acknowledge receipt of
your telegram protesting against the
mposltion of tlie la,x on copper as writ
ten into tlie new revenue measure. I
quite agree with you Hint such a tax
s unjust and palpably discriminatory.
It vitally affects tlie greatest single in
dustry in our state and I heartily
joined witli other members front the
copper producing states In an effort to
have the provisions stricken from the
bill when it was before the house last
week, but we were unsuccessful.
"Realizing Hie necessity of raising
additional revenue to defray the ex
penses of the very heavy preparedness
program which the country lias up
parently demanded, and which is now
In process of completion, I Tell that,
some of the additional tuxes might,
with propriety and justice, he levied
against tlie manufacturers of muni

tinue to profit so generously from I lie
adoption of such a program. I was
aiso perfectly willing lliat copper,
which is so largely produced in our
elate, should hear its just proportion
»f that lax and feel that our copper
producers would have inlerpoaed no
serious objection agaitiHl being as

den. Had the metals provision been
written so as to tax only such copper

of munitions of war, I could have sup
ported it. hut tlie subject was not so
equitably treated In Hie hill.

BALTIMORE, July 19.—The
German merchant submarine
Deutschland, with every indication
of being ready to eail at a mo
ment's notice, still wee lying at
her pier here at a late hour to
night. Her officers and crew were
aboard; her return cargo of nickel
and crude rubber waa said to be
all atowed and her fuel tank had
bren filled with a freah aupply of
petroleum.
BALTIMORE, July 19.—At 11 o'clock
tonight the two spars of the German
merchant submarine were taken down
und the conning tower dosed. Clone
at hand lay tlie lug Thomas F. Tim
mins. with a full head of steam up.
In the vicinity of tlie submarine were
numerous launches with agents of tlie
Eastern Forwarding company patrols
nbonrd. At 11:05 o'clock these craft
hailed a newspaper launch and tried
lo induce the reporters to leave. "You
are interfering witli our plans," the
watchman said.
I'o all appearances the Deutschland
was ready to leave at any time. Her
crew and muster were ubourd.
Among tlie late events that tended
to confirm this belief was the (Rowing
of more than 40 tons of fuel oil on
tlie submarine late this afternoon. An
official interested in the submarine's
activities earlier in the day sought to
create tlie impression that tlie two
tank cars of oil run onto the pier
where the Deutschland was berthed
were intended for the second subma
rine merchant man tiiat is expected
here in the near future.
The stevedores who have been work
ing day and night for nearly a week
putting aboard the return cargo of
rubber and nickel, were discharged
this afternoon, two hours before tlie
usuul time for the day shift to quit.
All shore leave for the crew of tlie
Deutschland was stopped tonight. Ac
cording to stories told by friends of
some of tlie submarine's seamen, tho
latter have expressed deepest anxiety
over the possibility of their falling vic
tims to the allied cruisers reported
to he awaiting tile submersible off the
capes—not from cannon, but from dis
