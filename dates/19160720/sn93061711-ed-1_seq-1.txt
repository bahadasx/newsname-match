TUCUMCARI, QUAY COUNTY, NEW MEXICO, THURSDAY, JULY 20, WIG
NO. 43
L
IS
RELEASED ON BOND
It will wo remembered that a short
time ago Jeff Woodward, a well known
Quay county eiti.un, was shot and
killed at his farm near Logan, ly one
Paul Hctihlcr, an old friend and com
panion. The trial was hold hefore A.
Jones, justice of the peace at Logan,
and the defense did not give any les
timony or reason for committing the
crime. Tho justice held Hcuhlcr to
the grand jury without hail and he
was placed in the county jail where
he has remained until a few days ago
when an order from Judge Mob was
received in this city requesting that
he 1)0 released upon his giving a sat
isfactory hond for .? 10,000. This Heu
hlor did and it was signed liy ten rep
resentative citizens of Logan and vi
cinity, being J. II. Shollcnhnrgcr, Fred
Congden, Earl Carrikor, .1. W. Pratt,
W. P. llrayton, .1. W. Sanders, It. I
Cook, August Rodcwaldt. A. W. Hruhn
and .1. F. Moss.
Judge Lich in his order said "the
i.ouri lunncr iimis tnni tne hum I'atii i
lluehlcr is entitled to lie released on !
hull."
Paul lluehlcr, through his attorney,
Roynl A. Prentice claimed "that the
said A. Jones had failed and refused
to die and execute a hond to the State
for tho faithful performance of his
duties as justice of the peace and had
failed and refused to take and sub
scribe the oath or nillrmntion in writ
ing, as required by the laws of the
State of Now Mexico, etc.
"That upon such failure by the said
A. Jones to lile such bond and oath
aforesaid, the said A. Jones thereby
resigned his said olllce of justice of
the peace and refused to serve therein
and the said oflke became by reason
of such failure, ipso facto, vacant
-and said olllce had not been tilled
by appointment or election, as re
quired by law."
This wns given as a reason that A.
Jones was not qualified to try the case
and had no right to set tho punishment
or hold lluehlcr to the action of the
grand jury without bail, so an appeal
was mnde to Judge Licit and District
Attorney Remloy made no objections
to said petition and it was up to Mr.
Liel) to say what should be done, so
bo set the bond at $10,000 and lluebler
gave it and wns released.
This case will probably come up for
trial at the October term and some
sensational testimony is expected on
both sides, as Mr. Woodward and Paul
lluehlcr had a number of friends in
this county.
.MAIL CLERK LOSES FIGHT
TO SAVE INJURED LEG
Pratt, July 18. W. D. Settle, the
mail clerk who was shot while on
duty in a mail car between Dalhart,
Texas, and Liberal, a year ago last
January, has just returned from a
hospital at Chicago. 111., where he was
taken oon after the accident. He
states that he has at last consented
to have his leg removed, after nearly
two years of intense suircring in an
eirort to save it.
Settle was working in his car when
his helper became insanely enraged
after a debauch in which whiskey
counted, and without warning, shot
Settle in the leg, splintering the bone
just below the hip. He was first
treated at Liberal and later taken to
Chlengo, and has been there ever since.
Soon after, his wife was taken to a
tubercular sanitarium in Colorado and
there, separated by many hundred
miles, these two people have made a
brave fight for life against great odds.
He has often written his chief clerk
and others of the railway mail clerks,
and each letter has boon one full of
hope, and filled with a spirit of eon
tentednoss that has been a wonder to
his co-workers, They have all assisted
him in a financial way, and great in
terest in centered in his unusually sad
and lengthy fight for life. Ho is now
in n Kansas City hospital, where the
operation will take place to rcmovo
the infected limb.
TAXPAYER'S ASSOC'N HUSY
SnntnFe, N. M., July 10 A. E.
Jnmen. director of tho Taxpayers' As
sociation of Now Mexico, left today to
visit San Miguel, Mora, Colfax, and
Union counties to consult with district
school directors and county school
superintendents on tho school tax es

ty superintendents have boon reduced
a total of more thnn $10,000. Heforo
the end of August Mr. James expects
to visit all tho counties in connection
with tho school estimates, and should
tho ratio of savings effected hold good
a very important saving in school tax
levies will havo been effected for the

HEUBLER
U. S. TO ADD 157 WAR- j
SHIPS IN THREE YEARS I
Washington, D. C, July 18. Tho
senate today adopted the enlarged
building program of the naval bill by
a vivi voco vote. It provides for the
construction within three years of 157
war vessels of all classes and for four
dreadnoughts and four buttle cruisers
to bo built next year.
In passing this measure, the senate
acted in exact accord with the recom
mendation of renr ndmirnl Knight of
tho naval war college, made in n report
which the officer submitted to secre
tary of the navy Daniels concerning
lessons to he derived from the Jutland
sea battle. In this report rear admiral
Knight suggested that if the number
of capital ships to be constructed next
year bo fixed at eight, they should
comprise four dreadnoughts and four
battle cruisers.
Tho intention of tho navy depart
ment, If its suggestions can be favor
ably acted upon, is to restore the
United States to second place among
nations in naval strength.
By a vote of -18 to 18, the senate re
jected an amendment to require three I
of tne now battleships to bo kept on
the Pnciflc coast. It was argued that
the amendment would bo an infringe
ment on the constitutional authority of
tho president as commnndcrlnchicf of
the navy.
COUNCIL ERECTS SIGNS
TO REGULATE TRAFFIC
The city council has caused a mark
er to be placed at the intersection of
several of the main down-town streets
which reads "Keep to tho Right" and
the city marshal has been appointed
nit instructor to the general traveling
public. Marshal Horton is now the
busiest man in town telling those who
do not know the ways of a city and
writing permits to drivers of motor
vehicles. This is a good move and
will make for the safety of all classes.
The increasing number of autos and
the trusting them to inexperienced
drivers mndo it upsnfo to travel on tho
main streets.
The marshal is armed with a list of
questions, prepared for him, no doubt,
by one of his lawyer friends, ns they
cover the proposition thoroughly and
when an applicant has successfully an
swered all of them, he is without doubt
familiar with the new ordinance No.
1 1 1 recently passed by the city coun
cil and which is now in effect.
This ordinance specifics the speed
of cars within different limits and the
marshal is ordered to arrest those
who disobey such ordinance. Every
owner of an auto or any driver of n
motor vehicle is requested to call at
the city ofllco for a driver's permit
anil n copy of the ordinance.
This ordinance if it is enforced as
it should bo will be of much value to
any autolst who may at some future
time desiro to go to some of the largo
cities and drive in a place regulated
by similar ordinances. This will also
cut out jay-walking and groups stand
ing in the streets or upon crossings
passing the time of dny or talking over
social or political matters.
Regulation in the largo citios 1ms
been a great saving to life and limb
but it has not eliminated the speed
artist or more properly named tho
"speed maniac." The following tcl
gram is a sample of what is going
on in Chicago.
"Chicago, July 18. Reckless auto
mobile driving has killed 134 persons
in Chicago since January 1st of this
year. Many of the deaths havo been
hie to the activities of so-called speed
maniacs, it is said."

TUCUMCARI YOUTH
DROWNS IN CANADIAN
David Ostlc, the 17-year-old son of,
Mr. and Mrs. Ostic. who has been a .
resident of Tucumcari for a number (
of yenrs, was drowned in tho Canadian '
river, Sunday about noon.
Young Ostic, together with three
other boys rode a freight train north

ing oir eight miles this side of the
river, Ostic and another young man
named Smith going on up to tho river. !
When they reached to river the Smith '
boy says Ostic wanted to go in swim-1
ming but he thought the wnffcr was
too deep and refused to go in. Ostlc
went in nnd after wading around for
a few minutes got. beyond his depth
and began his struggle for life. He
could not swim nor neither could tho
Smith boy. He sank in the deep hole
which was said to bo about 15 feet in
depth. Then Smith ran back to the
railroad for help. Some Mexicans at
the section house wero notified and
they immediately returned with Smith
to the place where Ostic went down
and tried to find tho body. They were
unsuccessful so parties telephoned to
Tucumcari and n number went up from
here, hmery Drown, who is a good
swimmer, dived to the bottom of the
hole and succeeded in locating the
body which seemed to be fastened to
the bottom. It was necessary for him
to go down several times before he
could bring the body to tho surface.
It was taken to the railroad and then
brought to Tucumcari on the south
bound "I'ollv."
Young Ostic wns well known here
ns he had been in the employ of the
Uutter Grocery store as delivery boy.
His family wero respectable citizens
nnd Young Ostic was educated so thnt
he spoke tho English language quite
as well as the Spanish.
The body wns kept until Tuesday
morning until his brother could ar
rive from Kansas, when the funeral
was held at 10 o'clock at the family
residence, conducted by Rev. Maddox,
pastor of the First Daptist church.
There were a large number of tho
friends present lit tho funeral and fob
lowed in the procession to tho ceme
tery where tho body wns laid to rest.

two rooms. The lodge and church
people of that community propose to
put on the upper story t'i bo used as
a hall and for religious services. This
makes a valuable addition to Quay and
would Ite used most every Sunday.

The Tucumcari base ball club has
made arrangements to play some of
the strongest teams in this part of the
country and is rounding into shape by
practicing every evening nnd those
who have the spare timo during tho
day are practicing faithfully. It is
true that Tucumcari hns tho material
for the making of a first-class team,
but has not been practicing together
because of the fact it was not known
whether the management would be
able to match them with teams of our
neighboring cities.
On next Sunday Tucumcari will play
the best Clovis can scrape together
from her good list of ball players and
a battery from Roswell, perhaps. This
promises to he one of tho best games
of the season next Sunday, July 23.
Amarillo's best will be hero the fol
lowing week for two games, playing
Sunday and Monday, July H0 and ,91.
This team has not invaded Tucumcari
for five yenrs, but it is known here
that if Tucumcari expects to win she
must trot out her best and they must
play some ball.
Tucumcari will play a return game
with Clovis at that city on August 0.
Our old nnd usually successful rival
Dalhart will be hero August 13 anil
M.Sunday and Monday, for two games
and it is expected thnt these games
will bo up to their usually high stan
dard. Tucumcari will play at Amarillo on
Sunday, August '20.
The Southwestern team from El
Paso is expected to recruit some of the
best players in El Paso and come up
for a game August 27. They expect
revenge for their recent defeat by a
score of 0 to 0.
PERSHING ARMY WILL STAY
IN MEXICO FOR THE PRESENT
Washington, D. C, July 19. When
told about dispatches from Mexico
City suying spccinl agent Rodgers had
informed tho Cnrranza government
that the United States troops in Mex
ico gradually would be withdrawn, act
ion secretary of state Polk said Mr.
Rodgers had no authority to mnke ar.y
such statement and that the policy of
tho American government remained
unchanged.
Informnl conferences between Mr.
Polk and Eliseo Arrodondo, the Mexi
can ambassador-designate, continued
todny at the state department.
Although press dispntches from Mex
ico City have announced tho appoint
ment of Mexican members of a joint
commission to undertake adjustment
of differences between the two coun
tries, it Uvas stated officially at the
department that no final agreement as
to the method of conducting the ne
gotiations had been reached.
It wns explained also thnt if it
xhould lie determined to mnko a joint
commission, the American member
could not be headed by Henry P. Flet
cher, nmlmssndor-designnte to Mexico,
because Mr. Fletcher's official position
would prevent him from serving in
that capacity.

RURAL CREDITS HILL GIVES
EQUAL SHARE TO FARMER
Washington, July 17. President
Wilson today signed tho rural c red Its
bill, passed recently by congress. Just
before signing the measure, which
creates a system of twelve lnnd loan
bunks under direction of a federal
board, the president made a short ad
dress. "I cannot go through the simple
ceremony of signing this bill without
expressing the feeling that I have in
signing it." said the president. "It Is
a feeling not only of profound satis
faction, but of real gratitude that we
have completed this piece of legisla
tion, which I hope will bo immensely
beneficial to the farmers of tho coun
try. The farmers, it seems to me,
have occupied hitherto a singular po
sition of disadvantage. They hnve not
had the same freedom to get credit on
their real estate that others have had
who wero in manufacturing und com
mercial enterprises, and while thoy
have sustained our life thoy did not,
in the same degree with others, shnro
the benefits of that life.
"Therefore, this bill along with tho
very liberal provisions of the federal
reserve act, puts them upon an equal
ity with nil others who have genuine
assets and makes tho grent credit of
tho country available to them."
ECLIPSE OF MOON
IS
E
The eclipse of tho moon, visible from
this city last Friday night, was one of
the most beautiful lunar spectacles
ever seen in Tucumcnri. The eclipse
started shortly after nine o'clock and
lasted about an hour. It was nearly
total as it covered seven eighths of the
moon and the view was not molested
as the sky was clenr and only one lit
tle cloud Interfered and that wns at
tho very beginning.
An eclipse of tho moon is caused by
the earth getting in between it und
the sun, cutting off tho solnr light and
thus causing a shadow through which
the moon passes. The sun is 109 times
greater in dinmcter thnn the earth.
The earth's center is 92,882,000 miles
from that of tho sun, nnd the moon is
only 210,000 miles from the earth.
The moon in this eclipse is not cen
tral within the shadow, and is there
fore not totally eclipsed. The length
of the earth's shadow varies, bccaUBC
the distance of the earth from tho sun
varies by 3,115,000 miles; and the dis
tance of the moon from tho earth va
ries within wide limits. Rut all va
riations are known to mathematicians
down to minute accuracy. But the
length of the shadow cast by tho earth
is always three times greater than the
moon's distance from the earth. Tho
velocity of the earth on its orbit
around the sun is on an nverage of
18.19 miles per second; nnd as the
moon is not left in the renr, it moves
with tho same speed. Rut the velocity
per second of tho moon around the
earth is only six-tenths of a mile. This
accounts for the long duration of a
lunar eclipse. When the earth Is at
its mean distance from the sun, nnd
tho moon at its average distance from
the earth, the length of the enrth's
shadow is 858,570 miles, but as tho
moon's distance is 2-10,000 miles, tho
mean diameter of the shadow where
the moon passes through is 5,714 milo3
Then, since the dinmeter of tho moon
is only 2.103 miles, we see another
cause foi tho long duration of lunar
eclipses. Since tho moon moves from
west to east, from right to loft, oppo
site to the motions of the hands of
a watch, the east side of the moon en
ters the shadow, and in his eclipse, tho
first touch of shadow will be seen in
the moon, in the great telescope at
time of total lunar eclipse the color of
the moon is somewhat like dull copper
but the outlines of the craters and
tops of rant nnd torn volcanic peaks
nro to bo seen. No appreciable effect
on .Ik earth or its inhabitants has
ever been detected by eclipses of tho
moon ovo'i If totnl. The cutting off of
the soft light reflected to earth from
the rock surfaco of tho moon two or
threo hours docs not lenvo any effects
largo enough to be detected by high
power instruments. A totnl eclipso of
tho moon is not nearly no imposing
und majestic as a total eclipso of tho
sun by tho moon. For totnl solar
eclipses aro as sublime as any spec
tacle in ?tho celestial vault presented
to tho eyo and mind of man.

telegraph lines arc tho same as last
year $18,070.
For tho yenr 1915 there were 8,497
head of horses, mules and asses. In
this year's assessment the number has
increased to 10,023, nnd the value has
increased from $400,288 to $478,151,
or nearly $72,000.
In 1915 there wero 30,399 head of
cattle on the assessment list This
year the number has increased nearly
10,000, the number being 40,147, nnd

The value of the railroads was prac
tically tho same, being $2,823,100 in
1915, nnd $2,823,530 in 191C.
Tho total valuo of nil taxable prop
erty for 1910 is $10,900,999, less ex
emption allowed to head of families
amounting to $425,800, which leaves
a net taxable value of $10,535,199, or
about $500,000 in excess to thnt of tho
year 1915.
This is the last assessment to be
made by the present assessor, James
Briscoe and he hns made a good rec
ord for accuracy and dilligcncc. Sir.
Briscoe hns taken care of this ofllco
to tho satisfaction of tho majority of
tho property owners in Quay county
and while he has mndo a few mistakes
during his official career, the next as
sessor will be forced to do his best
in order to keep thnt ofllce up to its
present high standard.
