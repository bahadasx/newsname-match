Grout Scrap as to Which Should
-
mj governor or 'jenneggee.
Hon. Alf Taylor, brother of Hon.
Bob Taylor, former Governor of Ten
nessee, was one of the speakers at
the LaddotVla Chautauqua Sunday.
Mr. Taylor is a warm friend of T. E.
Hook and family of Mexico and Mr.
and Mrs. Hook and daughter, Miss
Willie, went down to Laddonla to
hear the address. Mr. Taylor ac
companled them home and spent
Monday forenoon in our city. Oolng
from here to Columbia, where he ad
dressed the Columbia Chautauaua.
Alf Taylor and Bob Taylor were
candidates for Oovernor of Tennes
see at the same time brothers at
that, mind you, Alf, a Republican,
and Bob, a Democrat. They met and
spoke on the same platforms, and
you can imagine they had some live
ly scraps. Bob got the office. The
latter was. a great- fiddler, and that
was a help and aid to hiB score.
Alf Taylor and Dr. J. W. Cox,
formerly of Laddonia, now of John
son City, East Tennessee, are very
close friends, both ardent Republi
cans. Dr. Cox Is a fine fellow. The
Message knows him well. He is a
brother of Mrs. T. E. Hook here.
Mr. Taylor declines to discuss pol
itics on his Chautauqua tours.
Our friend H. P. Warden writes
the Message that he Is for Col. Gard
ner for Governor. Mr. Warden
makes bis plea as strong as he can
put It. But he does not prove his
man any better than Atkinson. We
do not believe he .Is as good as At
kinson. We are for Atkinson for
Governor. So there.
