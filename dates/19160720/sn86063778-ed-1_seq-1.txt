The Catawba rumpant, with waters
flooding cities aiul towns situated
along its hanks, submerging houses,
cotton mills and manufacturing enterprises
almost without number,
smashing great railway and highway
bridges spauning its tempestuous
course, twisting great trees and doing
incalculable damage, ranging into
the millions, such was the record
of the most destructive flood that
ever visited the Piedmont section of
the Carollnas. As though the mighty
stream sought to shake itself in one
mighty protest agalast the almost
r superhuman efforts of man to conscribe
its course and limit its activities
it gave an exhibition of its almost
Irresistible power which resulted
in many mighty steel railway
bridges going down; three, four and
possibly Ave or six state and county
highway bridges, including the new
steel bridge at Mount Holly, and according
to reportH the elegant $100,000
built-for-the-ages reinforced concrete
structure at Sloan's Ferry, the
partial submersion of dozens of cot- J
ton mills unfortunately located too j
close to the banks of the stream. |
such ae the East and West Monbo '
Mills, near Statesville, Woodlawn and
Mount Holly Mills at Mount Holly
and various others, and of damago to
roads, crops, houses, timber that cannot
be estimated at this time.
One of those who had witnessed
several fierce Ohio and Mississippi
floods likened the Catawba to one of
the tributaries of those streams during
the flood tide of their lrrestible
sway, when there was nothing that

, * uRe to the Immense concrete dams |
and power stations of the Southern |
Power Company on the Catawba
could not be figured but It will range
Into the hundreds of thousands of
dollars. No big dam was washed
away but the power houses of every
description were flooded, thus curtailing
operations and of course entailing
much injury to machinery and
equipment. At Lookout Shoals, 12
miles north of Statesville, the water
had washed over and carried away
a great embankment fill on tho Catawba
side which, while it relieved
part of the pressure on the dam
proper, turned loose such a flood of
water that tho old West Monbo Mill
below, with its 6,000 spindles was
submerged and tho East Monbo new
I mill directly across the river partially
put under water, he warehouse was
flooded and hundreds upcm hundreds
of bags and bales of cotton washed >
away.
Passing down the river, the Sea
uimru j\ir Dringe ai Mount Holly |
was the first to break, the middle pier
being smashed which dropped down
the two central spans. Later In the \
afternoon at 5:35 the Southern's steel
main-lino bridge across the Catawba
near Belmont, on the direct route
through to Atlanta, went down, the
t shock carrying a foreo of workmen
engaged in seeking to relieve some
of the driftwood prossuro on the
lower end of the bridge. This bridge
was built about 12 years ago and was
regarded as one of the best on the
line.
The Interurhan new all steel bridge
at Mount Holly went out about 8:30
when all telephone connection with
the river wn9 lost. This break was
almost Inevitable when tho Seaboard
bridge i fhll, thus superimposing all
the pressure on tho already heavily
[burdened structure below. The reports
as to the Southern bridge on

the structure was holding but tho
crest of tho flood had not reached
that point At that time.

At Mount Holly, the Seaboard Air

Sunday afternoon. Driftwood ac-"

excessive. At Laboratory, High
Shoals, Long Shoals, Harden and
elsewhere, the loss was estimated into
the hundreda of thousands.
The Dravo Power Company dam
and power station on the Broad River
near Gaffney was carried away, demonstrating
that the Catawba was not
alone In its demonstration of mighty
power. At Ninety-Nine Islands some
15 to 20 milos below, the water wan

of the Southern Power Company station
but not doing any vast amount
of damage when last heard from
The power house had been submerged
but this damage can he rectified.
The Broad was far ahead of anything
ever known before In the history of
the stream.
Officials of the Southern Power
Company did nothing hut. watch the
rising waters. At Lookout the water
was higher than ever before. Indeed
mere are no records in over 100
years that approach tho present levels.
The dam was constructed to
withstand anything imaginable hut
such a flood as this was never considered.
The fact that the great pile
of reinforced concrete was able to

work of the contractors and those
that designed it.
A dramatic incident in connection
with tho breaking of the Seaboard
trestle in the afternoon was the pros
once of at least a hundred or more
snectntnrs along the trestle just a few
moments before the crash came, bitf
some wiseacre gave warning of th*
close proximity of danger and nearly
everybody left the bridge before the
break came. With the exception of
two boys, who were almost In the
middle of the structure when It began
to bend and snap. Their quick
ness alone saved them. Wita a dash
they escaped to an adjoining span
before the broken part of the struc

with cheers by many of the bystanders

declared that the combined offenside
of the Allies had wrenched the
initiative from the Germans, never, he
trusted, to return.
"We have crossed the watershed,"
ho said, "and now victory is beginning
to flow in our direction. The
change is due to the improvement in

The cenference was held at the
War Office and was participated in by
Albert Thomas, French Minister of
Munitions; General Bioliaeff, Assistant
Minister of War of Russia; Gen.
A. Dall Olio, member of the Italian
Ministry of War, and the new British
Minister of Munitions, Edwin S.
Montagu.
"Since our last munitions conference,"
said Mr. Lloyd-George, "there
has been a considerable change in
the^ fortunes of the Allies. On that
date the great Champagne offensive
in the West had Just failed to attain
its objective, and the French and
British armies had sustained heavy
losses without the achievement of any
particular success. In the east the
enemy had pressed the gallant armies
of Russia back some hundred miles,,
and the Balkans had just been overrun
by the Central Powers.
"The overwhelming victories won
by the valiant soldiers of Russia hav?>
struck terror Into the hearts of our
foes, and these, coupled with the immortal
defense of Verdun by our indomitable
French comrades, and the
brave resistance of the Italians against
overwhelming odds <n tho Southern
Alps have changed the whole complexion
of the landscape.
"Now tho combined strength in the
east and west has wrenched the initiative

Washington. ? Department commanders
of National Uuurdamen now

! border, were instructed by the War
Department to defer transportation to
I the frontier until tho militiamen I

ing issued by the department when
the Mexican situation was acute,
which waived certain requirements.
About 26,000 men are affected.
The latest information of the Department
is that about 100,000 Natioiu.l
Guardsmen now aro at the
border. With the 50,000 regulars
there are u.uuo additional men called
from the reserves, officials estimate
that the American strength on border
service within a few weeks will
he adeqaute to cope with any present
emergency and will make unnecessary
the d: patch of any more guardsmen
until they aro completely equipped
and organized.
Published stories that uso of a
general draft was being considered
to (ill the National Guard ranks were
denied by the Department. The following
statement was issued by tho
Official Press Pureau.
"The statement that the War Department
is contemplating the drafft
system to recruit the National Guard
is nonsense. Statemonts te that effect
aro purely speculative and have
no basis in fact."
Reports that National Guard units
are being supplied poor and insufficient
food are not borne out In
preliminary telegraphic reports received
from all the Department commanders.
A message from General Funston
reported that General Trevino had
sont many troops south with the intention
of occupying th? GuerroroSan
