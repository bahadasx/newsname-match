i
, Virginia troops will not po cither Jo
I Tobyhanna, I'a , or to Fori Mycr lri the
i near future, according to ;t mfssace
? received yesterday evening by Adju
ta:ii?Gennra 1 Sale from the Department
of the Fast headquarters at G ov
ernor's Island. N. V. Ka< h of the
training ??amps recommended by <>??
| etal Sale is reported to have ito room
for t!ie Virginia organizations.
I -Right batteries of field artillery are
already in camp at Tobyhanna, says
the telegram to General Sale, and there
is no place for the First Virginia Bat
tal.on. Kort Mycr is o?'? upied with
District of Columbia militiamen, and
cannot receive soldiers from '"amp
.Stuart
Adjutant-General Sab said last night
that the rnr-s5ae'' apparently meant
'that the Virginia soldiers would have
to re nain where iliey are for the pres
ent. Kfforts may be made later to
secure some other training ground for
th?- men in Camp Stuart, but negotia
tions now appear to be at a standstill.
In apparent contradiction of the mes
sage received by Adjutant -General Sale
; came an unofficial report from Wash
ington which indicated that, an early
order for Virginia troops to move to
Radio, near Kort Mycr, might be ex
pci-d. The communication follows:
"Major Kenton, commandant at Kort
'Mycr. rode over the District militia's
mobilization site at Radio to-day to
ascertain whether or not there was
room for the Virginia organization,
iie doclded there was.
(?K.N (CMA I. SAI.K DIM ItKIMTS
RADIO CAMP It KPORT
'The rnoutiteil organizations probably
will be assigned to location near the
site now occupied by the two bat
teries of field artillery and the troop
of cavalry of the District militia. The
Field Hospital Corps ill most likely
be assigned to the site vacated by the
District Hospital t'orps, now on the
border. Accommodation for the other
l organizations can be provided on the
ground left vacant by the First Sepa
rate Battalion."
Adjutant-General Sale was inclined
to place little confidence in the report
Just quoted.
As Jias been stated before. Adjutant
, General Sale's wish to move the sol
<'icrs from Camp Stuart is not caused
by defects in the camp site, but by
tiie fact that at the regular army posts
the iiK-n can receive target practice,
'both wish small arms and with the
Held artillery, and can have the use of
tiie horses.
A happier crowd of men than the
er.clneer company at Camp Stuart may
be hiding somewhere around Richmond,
!'iit they havt* not come out into the
j open. The cngiueci s have received
their uniforms. I'or fourteen days
they have been tenting on the Fair
Grounds, wearing whatever clothing
they came in and hoping every day
for real uniforms.

I Ry hard recruiting efforts the mem
' bership of the engineer company has
I been raised to more than seventy, and

. inspecting officers for mustering into
the. Federal service. Officers of the
| company are confident that a very
i small percentage of their men will he
j eliminated by tiie physical examiha
! tlon.
On account of the scarcity of engi
neer companies in the militia of the
j UtiitecR States, there is reported to ho
i need foj- more men of that branch on

A band of Villa bandits attacked a
train on the Mexico Northwestern near
Santa Ysnbel, about fifty miles west of
here, yesterday, according to a report
to General Trevino to-day. The bandits
wore beaten off, and eight' of them were
brought here to-day for trial bv court
martial.
The prisoners', who said they were
members of a small band commanded
by Martin Lopez, a notorious Villa lieu
tenant. asserted they had been cut off
from the main Villa army after the
recent tight at .1 inline/, and were on
their way to the Itlg Bend district of
Texas. After the Jiminez engagement,
they said, they made their way into tile
Procidentia Valley, west of here, where
they remained in hiding several days,
finally being forced by hunger to at
tack the train, which they did not
expect to carry a military escort.
A loosened rail brought the train to
a stop, but before the out laws could
board it the guard detrained and at
tacked. The bandits tied southward
afoot, leaving horses, prisoners and
several dead. Government troops suf
fered no casualties.

The prisoners raid if they had been
successful they would not have at

start toward Ojinsiga.
Reports of General Trevino to-day
from Colonel Rojas, at Ojinaga. said
that he had completed the disposition
of his troops to repel the reported ad
vance of a band of "JOO Villa followers
upon tho American border in that
vicinity. He said that his scouts had
not determined the exact location of
the bandits, hut added that he had in
formation that the outlaws havo con
nections in the Pulled States from
whom they expert to obtain what sup
plies and ammunition they need.
Reports from the south were meager,
hut. indicated that the campaign against
the main Villa band along the Km
