Sioux City Daily News, 15: Crys

letin.) A full grown man eating
shark was sighted in about ten feet
of water, just off Saunders beach
here last night by Barr Lee Korn, of
Sioux City, who was here to do a
In tie fishing. Mr. Korn said the
coiirk came to the surface of the
water and spoke to him like a dog.
He replied sharply, whereupon the
shark jumped clear out of the water
and theratened him savagely. Mr.
Korn, having read of the shark scare
along the Atlantic coast, became
alarmed and withdrew to the club
house where he related his amazing
story before a large assemblage of
bathers. The announcement created
great excitement.'
Crystal Lake (Second Bulletin)
There is some doubt about the accu
racy of the shark' story related here
by Barr Lee Korn, of Sioux City. It
is reported that just before seeing the
shark, Mr. Korn had been to Jack
son and had merely stopped here on
his way home.
Crystal Lake (Third Bulletin.)
It is now definitely established that
there is no truth in the shark story
as related by Barr Lee Korn, of
Sioux City. It is now a matter of
Eositive record that Korn had just
een to Jackson and that he was in
toxicated when he made his discov
ery. But anyway, for a moment,
Crystal lake was in style.

who underwent an operation at the
Samaritan hospital yesterday, was

ans will have to transport their own
beer and whisky 'from Jefferson, S.
D., and Jackson, Neb., if the su
preme court upholds the decision
made by Judge Frey, of Boone, in
the Franklin county district court
Tuesday. The Boone judge held
that liquor shipped into the state at
once becomes subject to the state
laws. Woodbury County Antisaloon
league officials asserted yesterday
that they were greatly interested in
the decision and that if it is affirmed
in the higher court transportation
companies engaged in hauling liquor
to Sioux City from Nebraska and
South Dakota "wet" towns will be
forced out of business. The ruling
means that if a pdrson wants liquor
for his own consumption he will
have to go to Jefferson or Jack
son and get it- himself."
John F. Joseph, attorney for the
league asserted. "He cannot send
a mail order to one of the wholesale
houses in Nebraska or South Dakota
and get the liquor delivered to his
home as is now done." Itisimprob

Frev's decision reversed. House at
Jackson and'Jefferson are not direct
ly-interested in the case and will not
finance the' figHt of the "weu" at
Hampton, who will appeal the case.
Judtre Frey's decision was handed
down in a case against the Theodore
Hamm Brewing company, ol btFaul,
which maintains a branch house at
Elk Point, S. D. The Adams Ex
press company also was a defendant.
The "drys" contend in the suit that
the brewing company and the ex-
firess concern were maintaining a
iquor nuisance at Larimer, la.,
claiming that they received and
gave out liquor consigned to private
parties. The defense of the defend
ants, which will be fought out in the
supreme court, is that the liquor
was in interstate traffic and that the
Iowa courts have no .jurisdiction. ,
Sioux City Journal, 17: .Word
was received in Sioux City lasfnight
of the death of Mrs. Winfield S.
White", 1523 Jackson street. She
died in a hospital in New York City
Saturday night. The body will be
brought to Sioux City Wednesday
for burial. Mrs. White had been in
New York City for the last two
weeks. She underwent an operation
while in the hospital. She had suf
fered from stomach trouble for sev
eral months- Her husband, Winfield
3. White, and son, Dr. March White,
and Mrs. March White were in JNew
York. Mr. and Mr. White had lived
in Sioux City for twenty-five years.
They were married in LeMars, la.
Mrs. White was a member of the
Order of the Eastern Star. Surviv
ing her, besides her husband and Drr
March White, is Howard White,
another son, of Sioux City
Though scores of bathers were with
in a short distance of him, Fred Fos
ter, a deaf mute, 2 years old, w.is
drowned in five feet of water in
Crystal lake yesterday after
noon at 8:30 o'clock. Two compan
ions, also mutes, were at his side.
They found difficulty in giving the
alarm, and Foster was submerged
for ten minutes. When the body
was drawn from the water the
mouth and nose were filled with
moss and weeds. Assistance was
summoned from -Sioux City. One
pulmotor, property of the Sioux
City Service cumpany, and another,
property of the fire department,
vere hurried to the lake. The in
struments drew particles of moss
and,weeds from the upper part of
Foster's lungs. The',lungs respond
ed feebly to th'e pulmotor, but did
not start heart action, although ef
forts were continued longer than
an hour. Sheriff George Cain, of
Dakota, City,, who. happened to-be at
Crystal lake, took charge of the
body pending thearrival of W. E. Al
len,- ot nomer, coroner ot uaKota
county. The body -Was removed to a
cottage a short distance . from the
bathing, beach. ' Fosterdived at 521
Jennings street. He was a tailor,
and was employed by the ' Boyer
Hollenbeck company, Fourth and
Nebraska streets. He had lived in
Sioux City for several. years.- A
brother, .Louis Eoster,.and.his.moth
er live at Rosedale, Mo., and a sister.
Mrs. J. M. Kennedy, "lives in Lex
ington, Ky. The death of Foster
was the only accident reported from
the Sioux City water resorts yester
day, Thousands desented the city
during'theday in favor, of bathing
beaches and parks. v
of the service, was arrested by the
potrolman for speeding in his auto
mobile. At the time the young man
was hurrying to the postofiice to
mail a letter to his commanding offi
cer at Denver, notifying him that he
was about to join his troop. He was
driving at high speed in order to be
at the postofiice before the mails.
In court Saturday morning McPher
son paid a fine of $10 under protest.
Before leaving in his automobile for
Denver Sunday, McPherson filed
with his commanding officer an ac
count of his arrest. , Civil officers,
according to army regula
tions, have no authority to arrest a
soldier of the United States army on
his way to mail a letter to an officer.
McPherson will attempt to recover
the amount of the fine which went
to the school district and a damage
action is threatened against the pa
trolman by the young man's parents.
.. . .Miss Ella Wahlburg, who came
out from New York to break or es
tablish swimming records at Crystal
lake, essayed the feat late yesterday
afternoon. She was to Bwim from
the Crystal Lake hotel to Crystal
beach. The swim was to be made
in either four minutes, or four hours,
the reasonable record for the dist
ance escaping mind at the moment.
It is considered quite a Bwim, how
ever long it may take. Miss Wahl-
urg was going good, until in the
mmaie oi tne mxe an ,attacK oi
cramps sneaked up on her, and she
had to give it up for the day. She
said it was cramps, not a shark. In
cidentally, before taking the plunge
from the boat dock starting point,
she discoursed to some extent on
sensible bathing suits. The fair
bathers at the lake, wear too many
clothes, she advised. "There's no
use for woman to burden herself
down because man isn't used to bare
knee caps, except on the stage,"
she said. "Women never can learn
to get the best advantage out of the
greatest exercise in the world until
they quit trying to drag half a ton
of clothes around in the water with
them. There's a lot of this equality
of the sex bunk. Convention is
custom or something like that, and
pretty soon all the women will be
wearing no more clothes at bathing
beaches than men are used to wear
ing. People will get used to it and
think nothing of it. Why in
France " Probably so! The
picture shows Miss Wahlburg's idea
of a sensible bathing suit for fair
swimmers, whether they be fair or
nonfair. She persists that those
women swimmers from Sioux City
who wear the Annette Kellerman
uniforms only in dangerous and se
cluded spots at the lake will soon be
braving the crowds at the beaches.
In the meantime, the streetcar com
panies are provincial enough to be
making plans for added service to
the resort.
gations, the crop gets the benefit
from all the water thus put upon
the land at the point of turnout, ac
cording to the Mitchell Experiment
Station.
Two large losses of irrigation
water must be taken into considera
tion run-off and the underground
seepage. The run-off is always ap
parent and may be reduced to a
minium by the careful irrigator by
always catching tho run-off from one
ditch to another, the only waste be
ing in the end runs and on tho last
land. The run-off loss is well taken
care of by most farmers, but the
seepage loss has not been called to
the attention of the irrigator ns
forcibly as it should be, for the
reason that it is a condition that is
not so easily detected.
Profitable to Increase Production
Farmers whose crops are very far
below tho average are seldom pros
perous, uccording to a farm manage
ment survey of 205 farms in eastern
Nebraska conducted by the College
of Agriculture. Forty-three farm
ers whn crops were 80 per cent
poore. ilnn their neighbors made
less tha i ne-fifth as much money
after paying farm expenses and in
terest on investment as forty-four
farmers whose crops averaged 29
per cent above their neighbors.
The farms with intermediate or
average crop yields made average
profits.
While it is possible to invest so
much labor and capital in Securing
large crop yields that the increased
yield will not pay the cost, the sur
vey indicates that the Nebraska
farmer is much more likely to put
too little work upon his land than
too much. '
What the Farm Contributes
The farm contributes more to the
living of the man who owns his farm
than to the tenant, according to a
survey made by the College of Ag
riculture in eastern Nebraska. An
average of the figures shows that
the tenant gets $418 from the farm
while tho owner who operates his
farm gets $525. The increase to
the owner comes in the increased
value of the house and the increased
supply of fruit, wood, and honey.
In western Nebraska the relation
ship is the same, but the average
farm contributes somewhat less.
' Gapeworns
Gapeworms are commonly fnund
in poultry raised on low ground.
They may be seen attached to the
walls of the windpipe. For treat
ment restrict the birds to well-drained
quarters and plow the infested
areas. Individual treatment neces
sitates the removal of the worms.
By a feather moistened with turpen
tine swab out the windpipe.

A Definition of Good LI re ad
Bread should have a nutty and
sweet odor. There should be no
sour taste or smpll.
Bread should be of fine, even tex
ture With no large holes in it. When
pressed with the finger, it should
dent easily, but the dent should
Bnrincr back to the level surface. If
the dent stays in the bread, it is not
efficiently baked. If the bread is
so hard you cannot press it easily,
too much flour has been used in
rnixing.
Thccrust should be uniform in
thickness on all sides of the loaf.
It should be-rather thin and should
not behard.
Tho'bread should be baked in such
pans that it will The easily dnd be of
uniform height in all parts.
These are the points kept in mind
by home economic worker of the
College of Agriculture in scoring
breads at county fairs and other
contests.
