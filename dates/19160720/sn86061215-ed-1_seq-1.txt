been for twenty years an American

tion between adherents of William

KEEP STATE DRY
Keynote Speech at Meeting
in Des Moines Shows
Purpose of Party
TRIBUTE IS PAID
TO W. L. HARDING
Woman Suffrage and Better
Roads Among the Issues
Raised By Speaker
Des Moines, July 19. —An uncom
promising declaration in favor of pro
hibition featured the address delivered
today to the Iowa state republican con
vention by Burgess W. Garrett, tem
porary chairman of the convention and
clerk of the Iowa supreme court.
Cheers greeted his statement that "no
act of the republican party ever will
bring the saloon back to Iowa."
The speaker alBo declared for a
stronger foreign policy, both as regards
Mexico and the rest of the world, good
roads, amendment of the primary law,
woman suffrage and against militar
ism.
Speaking of the republican candidate
for president, Mr. Garrett said:
"The republican party presents a
man whose impulses throb with the
best interests of humanity. In Its can
didate for governor, it presents a man
who has ever been true to the cardinal
tenets of the republican faith and
above all to government 'of the people,
by the people and for the people.' And
with 'Hughes, Harding and harmony'
as our watchword, the republican par
ty In Iowa will roll up the largest ma
jority in November that has ever been
given a republican party In Iowa."
On the subject of roads, the speaker
said:
"The republican party stands for the
Improvement of the highways of the
state wherever this can be done with
out increasing the tax burdens of the
people. We favor just as good roads
as the taxpayers are able and willing
to pay for."
Harmony Assured.
Republican leaders who were In
conference for the greater portion of
the night were confident that harmony
would rule the state republican con
vention when that body was called to
order at 11 a. m. today by Charles A.
Rawson, chairman of the retiring re
publican state central committee. It
was said at the opening that most of
the contests to be fought out In the
district caucuses had been settled ami
cably and that ah-ongements were
complete to rush through a harmony
slate, especially with regard to the
new state central committee.
Resolutions drawn up tentatively
last night by W. L. Harding, guberna
torial candidate, and his lieutenants
were ready for submission to the reso
lutions committee as soon as It is
formed. It was said to be virtually
certain that the resolutions committee
will ratify the tentative draft and that
the platform will include planks pro
viding for prohibition, and good roads
with emphasis placed on a proposition
to leave the initiative in the matter of
good roads to the farmer taxpayers.
Havner To Win.
As the caucuses progressed there
was a growing conviction among poli
ticians that H. M. Havner of Marengo
would be chosen as candidate for at
torney general over George H. Wilson
of Des Moines. It was stated on good
authority that Mr. Harding had thrown
his support to Havner for political
reasons and the other leaders, many of
whom favored Wilson personally were
subordinating their private Interests to
what they considered the good of the
party and would vote for Havner. The
result of the balloting for the nomina
tion, which probably will not be reach
ed until late this afternoon, will in the
opinions of leaders be wry close. Pro-

CLOSES GREAT DAMAGE TO
LIFE AND PROPERTY.

waters in the Carolines and portions of
adjacent states were rapidly receding
today, leaving in their wake a property
loss estimated at from $12,000,000 to
$15,000,000 and a list of deaths from
drowning that has steadily increased
since the waters rose Sunday. Today
the toll of human life stood at thirty
four, with prospects that it might be
increased.
Two small villages In Rutherford
county, North Carolina, known as
Chimney Rock and Bat Cave, suffered
severe damage from the volume of
water that swept down the narrow
valley of the Rocky Broad river, ac
cording to meager reports reaching
here. The towns, eaoh of which has
a hundred or more inhabitants, are
more than twenty-flve miles from a
railroad and without wire communica
tion.
From Spartansburg, S. C., came a re
port that persons arriving there said
almost all of Chimney Rock was wash
ed away and that there was no sign
of its Inhabitants. Eight persons were
said to have -been drowned at Bat
Cave.
Loss to railroads, industrial plants
and agricultural Interests in North and
South Carolina has mounted into the
millions and it may be weeks before
the transportation Bystem is restored.
However, in many localities repair
work was being rushed today and
thousands of cotton mill spindles were
beginning to turn again.
Conditions in Virginia and West
Virginia were almost normal today and
great loss was not feared to the coast
section of South Carolina.

SCENE OF BATTLE
Chicago, July 19. —Crowds gathered
In the vicinity of 820 Irving avenue,
where yesterday, Henry P. Molntyre,
colored, killed four people and was
himself, together with his wife, later
killed, gave rise to fears of possible
race rioting early today and caused
fifty policemen to be dispatched to the
scene. They dispersed the crowd
quickly. To prevent further difficulty
colored people were ordered by the po
lice to keep off the streets. They
obeyed promptly. Extra policemen
were placed on guard in the district as
a precaution.
It developed today that back of the
murders of yesterday, and forming an
innocent means to them, was an un
served warrant charging Mclntyre
with disturbing the peace. A police
man sent Monday night to serve the
paper found Mclntyre away from
home. He decided to wait until morn
ing. The police say this decision
caused more deaths than have figured
In a single crime In years.

Miss Adams took the drug with
suicidal intent, the police say.
Dr. Atwood and Miss Adams former
ly studied under Harris at the college

MOVEMENT OF IOWA GUARDSMEN
EXPECTEDTO BE 8TARTED BE
FORE MANY HOUR8.
Des Moines, July 19.—The Chicago
Great Western railway today turned
over to the Des Moines interurban the
equipment necessary to take the first
battalion of the third Iowa infantry to
the Brownsville, Tex., concentration
camp of the Iowa national guard. It
was stated at Camp Dodge that the
battalion, comprising Companies A,
B, and D, probably would be en
route before night tomorrow.
There was little possibility, in the
opinion of officers, that the troop
movement would begin before late to
morrow. It Was pointed out that with
limited switching facilities ooupled
with the fact that the interurban line,
over which it will be necessary to
transport the troops, is a single track
line, will make the movement slow.
About twenty-flve cars divided into
trains according to their weight will
be required to move the first battalion.
Traffic experts at the camp today
said they had not received word re
garding whether tourist peepers had
been obtained for the transportation
of troops. They thought, however,
that the men would not be forced to
travel the entire distance in day
coaches.
Packing of equipment began this
afternoon.
It was learned this afternoon that
utmost efforts have been made to ar
range for tourist sleepers for the men
but that sufficient day coaches to ac
commodate the third regiment have
been concentrated at Oelwein and will
be used unless the tourist sleepers are
forthcoming at once.
CAVALRY TO QO.
The cavalry unit, under strength as
the result of the refusal of some of its
members to take the federal oath, was
to be mustered in late this afternoon.
The company was brought to minimum
strength by the addition of a company
from Grinnell, which had been destin
ed for the infantry.
Recruiting officers to be left behind
also were sworn In this afternoon.
REGIMENTAL HEADS

Washington, D. C., July 19. —The

ninth New York Infantry mustered put
of the federal service on account of
physical disability.
LUNGMOTOR USED
HOMER HECKER OVERCOME WITH
OA8 WHEN MAKINO CONNEC­
TION HELPER 8UFFER8.
Two men suffered from Inhaling gas
fumes and one of them was overcome
by gas early this morning while at
work on the M. W. Christie building
on Third street opposite the post
office. The presence of mind of one
of the men, D. Garren, who plugged
the pipe with a pair of cotton gloves
and suffered the breathing of the
deadly fumes while he rescued his
fellow workman, Homer Hecker, who
had fallen to the ground, saved the life
of Hecker and probably his own too.
The men were connecting the new
building with the street main and
were at work in a small enclosed
space beneath the outside stairway in
the front areaway. A small triangular
space communicating with the cellar
window was the only means of en
trance to the place where the men
worked. Hecker had removed the
plug from the pipe containing the gas
and was about to connect the other
pipe when the heat and escaping gas
In the close quarters caused him to
fall from the box on which he stood.
Garrin, who was with him Immed
iately sought to find the plug which
had fallen and being unsuccessful tore
the cotton gloves off his hands and
stuffed them into the open pipe to
plug It. His shouts for a time could
not be heard by the other workmen
In the building and although fast in
haling the deadly fumes, he managed
to lift his friend up and through the
narrow hole into the cellar where one
of the carpenters finally attracted by
the calling of Garren, came to his
assistance and the almost lifeless man
was removed to the open.
By this time Garren was so far gone
that he too had to be given attention
|and in the meantime the lungmotor
was sent for and soon arrived. For
several minutes a crowd of willing
helpers operated the life saver until
the doctors arrived. Hecker was soon
revived and both men sought the cool
and shady places until folly recovered.
