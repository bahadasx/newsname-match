Scured 0thC site just west of th:
Mor.ea intile warehouse. The coo
tract for the elevator was let las,
Saturday night to the Northwester;.
Mill Construction Co. and it is ex
peeled the elevator will be complet
ed in time to handle this years crop
It will have capacity of thirty thous
and bushels and besides handling
grain they will conduct a genera:
feed and coal business. This wit
give Malta four elevators and one
mill and speaks well for the growth
of the country from an agricultural
standpoint as only a few years age
we had but one elevator and it did
not run all the time.
There is business in this territory
for four elevators and with the pro
spect of a bumper crop they are all
assured a record breaking business.
The manager for the Farmers Ele
vator has not yet been selected but
it will be one with a wide experience
in the grain business.
THE GROWTH OF THE COUNTY
Assessor Roy Lee has completed
the assessment roll for 1916 and
turned it over to the county commnis
sioners who are in session at this
time as a board of equalization and
will be so for the next several days.
Phillips county according to the
assessment just returned advances
C from a seventh class county to be
of the sixth class and this year we
phave on the assessment roll 114,243
more acres of land that was not on
the assessment list last year. The
average valuation this year is six
teen cents per acre more than last
and averages $3.4S per acre.
S Stock cattle and sheep were also
advanced in valuation the former
S$2.. per head and the later 50
, .ents. ''herr is inot hin on wh i .l:

Snot a burden on the taxpayers as I

The jurymen on the Sizer case cast
county $1 S5.t0 and the wilm ;t ,
$10(i.00. the other mnan to be tried
entered a nlea of gulity. 'lThe .ast
of the jury and witnesses was not
all in the Sizer case as Phillips
county will now be forced to hoard
him at a cost of 75c per day unt il
the next term of court in October.
Sizer was ready for trial as was al
so the attorneys for both the state

man as district judge who will Ian
die the justice to be dealt out in
this manner Judge Utter is the one'
to retain on the bench but it it is
speedy work with out favoritismt
John Hurly would be the logical
candidate and the man deserving

III most cases where new counties
h:1tov, i,.i° organized in the state the
same thing has been done. In Blaine
ounllty a new set of commissioners
was elected as was the case in Sher
idanl ciunty. The question has nev
or been carried up to the supreme
ollIrt and a test case made, as it is
Sriather expensive business, for no
mllore than one can realize out of the
otlt-e, and in hoth of the counties
m.nitioned the cases were dropped
anil the comnmistsipners elected at
the time the county was divided,
Iilled out the term for which they
were elected.
Early in the spring there was some
talk of others comning out for coni
umissioners, and the question was put
up to the attorney general of the
state for an opinion, who answered
that in his opinion the two commiss
ioners elected for the six and four
termsl would not be called on to
nlIake the race for office until after
the expiration of their term for
which elected. If candidates for
eomtnlissioner are elected and the
case goes up to the supreme court it
will be a long drawn out fight and an
ex!atllsive one for both the elected
m!cnllbers and the county.

'ettcin,'g of ii e old trails is ai lI the
c(hallging of the road to section lilies.
In somie cases this is being ldont'
without the sanction of the county
ccni1 Inist. iloners. The law requires
that the new road he put in as good
condition as the old before the
change is made. but this is ignored
ito some extent so that the new roadi
in miany cases is not satisfactory to
the traveling public.
lThis qutestion of closing the old
trails is a very important one and
many interested people know that
these old trails should not be closed
at present, as nearly every case they
follow the easy grades and could be
made into good roads at a minimum
expenditure of funds. The county has
no great amount of money to spend
on the roads at present and it would
seem to the best interests of all con
cerned to postpone the opening of
new roads at present.

a quarter of a mile from the Mexican.

leased from the hospital where he
had been conlined with the mumps.
When the boys from Montana
pulled into their camping ground all
that could be seen was mesquite
bushes, cactus, ant hills, sand and
horued toads. By Saturday a tented
city had sprung iup. Row upon row
of neat appearing tents were to be
seen. All comlpany streets had been
cleared of brush and the camp put
in a sanitary condition.
Last evening the 18th Inft. band
came out to the Montana camp and
serenaded the Montana boys. They
were cheered lustily by the boys who
were about half dressed, while some
welre not even that much clothed.
