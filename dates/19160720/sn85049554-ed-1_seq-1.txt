GERMANS AGAIN OUSTED.
British Troops Again in Possession of
Longueval and Delville.
London, July 20.—The British troops
have recaptured In the village of Long
ueval and Delville wood most of the
ground taken by the Germans Tues
day night, according to the British of
ficial communication. Hard fighting is
still in progress in this region.
The capture of these points by the
Germans Tuesday night was heralded
in Berlin as the greatest success for
the Germans in counter attacking the
British front since the aHled offensive
began.
With Longueval In their hands the
Germans were able, not only to hold
up^the British advance toward Ba
paume over the highway from Bray,
but also could check any further ad
vance by the French m*"th of the
Somme.
Their success, however, was destin
ed to be short lived and once more
the British command the chief route
forward in General Haig's wedge-like
drive into the enemy's lines,
Fight Through Night.'
When General Haig's afternoon re
port was dispatched from headquar
ters In France the violent fighting,
which, developing from the German
counter attack, had been going on all
night long, was still In progress. The
German attacks on the Waterlot farm
and other points were repulsed.
In his brief dispatch General Haig,
in addition to reporting the recaptur
ing of the lost ground, stated that the
British fire had dispersed the Germans
massing for a further attack on the
Waterlot farm. These dispatches seem
to confirm the opinions constantly ex
pressed by the correspondents at the
front of the dwindling strength of the
German counter attacks.
The. night communication says:
"North of the Somme heavy fight
ing is still in progress in Longueval
village and the Delville wood. In both
places we have already regained most
of the ground lost last night.
"South of Delville wood this after
noon w«[ dispersed with our fire a large

WHY EXPENSE |& &REAtER.
Reginald McKenna Explains "Reason
JFor Increased Expenditures.
London, July 20.—Explaining the in
crease in' the government rate of ex
penditure to 6,000,000 pounds daily,
Reginald McKenna, chancellor of the
exchequer, said In the house of com
mons today that the figures related not
only to war Expenses but to total out
going.
The unforesoon and unforeseeable
causes which had raised the rate of
expenditure, added the chancellor, were
n^alnly the rate at which American se
curities have been sold to the govern
ment for the purpose of regulating
American exchange and the rate at
which advances made to allies and
dominions of Great Britain were drawn
upon. The concufrrence of these two
causes has led to the exhaustion of his
borrowing powers earlier than was ex
pected.
Lord Robert Cecil, minister of war
trade, declared in the house of com
mons today that he did not think there
was any reason to suppose the censor
ship now exercistd regarding press
messages to the United States was a«
all ligely to Interfere with Hie
continuation of friendly relations ol
the two countries. The censorship,
added the lord, waB established for
military reasons and Its abolition or
modification could not be evoked upon
non-military grounds.
A member had advocated abolition
of the censorship to show England's
confidence in the United States.
FLOOD DEATH TOLL
NOW SEVENTY-THREE

Asheville. N. C., July 20.—The list of
deaths from Sunday's flood In five
southeastern states, which has been
growing constantly, as channels of

still missing. Most of the deaths hav«*.
been in western North Carolina.
Property loss also has been heavy.
This has been confined to a great ex
tent to the Carolinas but adjacent por
tions of Tennessee, Virginia and West
Virginia also suffered. It was thought
Tuesday that $15,000,000 would cover
all loss of property.

by relief committees to care for flood
sufferers. It will be weeks before all
railronds will be normal again.

the government troops have a band
which consists of about 800 men, sur
rounded, and that Villa's -early capture
is probable. Reports from the garri
son at Guanaceyi Indicate that should
the bandits attempt to push on south,
the garrison at that point-is prepared
to reinforce General Ramos, who com
mands a force of about 4,000 men,
largely cavalry.

the- unanimous opinion of all officers
was that rations were excellent in
quality, the only criticism of the men
being due to monotony resulting
from deficiency of certain components
intended to give an agreeable variety.
Necessities for a variety for the

rapidly as possible.

ENTHUSIASTIC DRYS
WOULD FORCE ACTION
Attempt to Effect Adoption of Plat
form Before Draft
Is
Printed and
Copies Distributed—Strong Anti-Pre
paredness Plank Inserted.
St. Paul, July 20.—Efforts to offect
adoption of the resolutions commit
tee's draf^of a platform without first
printing and distributing copies to dele
gates this noon precipitated the first
contention among delegates at the pro
hibition national convention. The ad
vocates of consideration and adoption
of the platform at once receded from
their position and William Shaw, who
headed the effort to expedite consider
ation of the platform, withdrew his mo
tion. The convention then recessed till
2 o'clock.
For ten minutes the convention was
in an uproar, delegates standing on
chairs and shouting, while Chairman
Patton vainly pounded to restore order.
The delegates evidently desired to have
deliberate discussion of the various
planks In the proposed platform before
taking up the question of adoption.
Former Governor Sulzer, of New York,
did not appear before the convention
as an aspirant for the prohibition nom
ination for p^sident.
Tho propose platform led off with
strong declarauns for nation-wide pro
hibition and woman suffrage. These
were followed by anti-preparedness
and peace planks. Reciprocal trade
treaties with foreign nations and a fed
eral trade commission of specialists
were recommended.
Taking up the Mexican situation, the
platform declared the "democratic
party has blundered and the republi
cans evaded the responsibility."
Mexico needs not a. conqueror but a
good Samaritan, the platform says.

At dawn today a screen o' ti gs and

would not leave here for some hours at
least. To all appearance she was ready
to go on her voyage to Germany last

thut she was submerged^to about the

Yesterday a force of mechanics was
sent on board the boat to help tho
crew's mechanic overhaul the engines.
One of the engines was dismounted and
hurried in an automobile to a local

The tub Timmins, which has been
guarding the subim-rslble since she

thru the night over land*and water,

Ellis
Charges of Mismanagement at
Island to Be Instigated.
Xew York, ir.uly -0.—A survey of
conditions at the federal immigration
stations at Ellis Island 'will be made
by Representative Isaac Selgle, of Xew
York. Seigle was asked by Chairman
Burnett of the immigration committee
of the house to find out whether the
conditions alleged by Representative
W. S. Bennett to exist at the island
warranted an investigation.
Mr. Bennett's charges of immorality
and mismanagement on Ellis Island
are denied in a statement by Frederick
C. Howe, commissioner of Immigra
tion.
"The trouble," he said.f began when
I requested ,the department of labor
to take ovei* the private contract for
the feeding of immigrants at the
island. I wanted the government to
do it right, and take the element of
profit out of it. Mr. Bennett intro
duced an amendment to the sundry
civil bill which denied the government
that right. The contract in normal
times amounts to hundreds of thou
sands of dollars."

Harris, president of the Massachusetts
College of Osteopathy today had a
"fighting chance" to recover from the
three bullet wounds inflicted Tuesday
by Dr. Eldredge D. Atwood. also an

Adams, Dr. Atwood's fiance, a few
hours before the shooting of Dr.
Harris.
Dr. Atwood said he left Miss Adams
about 11 o'clock Monday night at tho
Park street subway station and that

she had been found unconscious in her
office. It. was said by the police that
she regained consclousn-s for a mo
ment and made attempts to speak to a
physician who asked her if she had
taken poison. She did not answer hut
nodded. Dr. Atwood is in Jail on a
charge of intent to kill.
Temporary Insanity will be the de
