I NEW LIGHT ON
I OLD PLAN OF
B ORGANIZATION
I i
Those Republicans who are respon
H siblo for tho calling of the County
Central committee who met and adt
I ed for the Republican party at the
court houso yesterday would do well
to brush up on party organization. Wo
respectfully call tho attention of
those gentlemen to section, 3, of the
H Plan of Organization of tho.RepubH-
can party which reads as follows:
"Tho County Central Committee
shall consist of the county chairman
Q and tho chairmen of the respective
election districts in tho county."
8'm Althought Is rule may have been
passed by Republicans who are now
"antldoluvlnns" as was charged by
one of tho gentlemen yesterday1, yet
we claim It is a Just one, and If prop
erly lived up to and respected it will
Bivo bettor satisfaction and bring
Torth more good fruit for the Repub
lican party than nil the questionable
manipulations of yestorday. If the
party Is to perform tho puiiioso of Its
organization tho rules of yesterday,
tnUBt be tho rules of today, and If
tho rules are "antl doluvlan" lefs
change them, but for tho sako of nil
that Is good, and for tho sako of the
Republican party, do not vlolato them.
THE TRAVELING
SPIRIT HAS HIT
BENSON WARD
Benson, July 16. Tho spirit of
travel and sight seeing has made It
eU felt In our ward lately.
6n Sunday last,' W. a. Reese and
turally went to Weston to visit their
son and daughter, Mr. and Mrs. J.
F. Reeder. Dr. Newell Munk went
with thera.
On Monday, Mr. and Mrs. A. J.
Reese nnd their sons Charles nnd
Foster and AnguB Funk left fon the
Buake river country where they have
relatives located. Their daughter ir.
tih had gono a few days before.
With regret wo learn that a reck
less driver ran Into them near Idaho
Falls and damaged their car qulto
badly, but they have had It repaired
nnd they are again on their journey.
On Wednesday, W. G. Reese nnd
wife nnd their sons Gordon nnd Arv-
el, took a three days trip to Salt Lako
City, and tho following day Mr. and
Mrs. R. O. Reese and Mr. and Mrs.
A. V. Reese left' for an outing to
Soda and Bear Lake to spend a week
or ten das.
On S.itmday last, Bishop nnd Mrs.
Reese and family and Mr. and Mrs.
M. E. Rogers and family left for
Salt Lake City to spend over Sunday
In Zlon.
On Frldny last Mr. and Mrs. Jona
than Smith and their family and Mr.
Smith's parents, making nlno passen
gers In their Case car, returned from
a six hundred mllo trip, going as far
as Drlggs, Idaho. They had a very
pleasant trip not having any car trou
ble and alj conditions mo3t favora
ble. The roads wero In excellent con
dition and the weather ideal. Mr.
Smith sayj he never saw the crops
looking -so good through Idaho as at
present, especially tho grain, hny nnd
potato crop. Water Is very plentiful
throughout the country where he
traveled. However ho thinks that
the Cache Valley sugar beet sre bet
tor thnn the crop In Idaho.
Ono of the saddest things that has
happened in our ward for a long tlmo
was tho accident on the Fourth, In
Logan canyon when Mrs. H. W. Bal
lard was run over by their cor nnd
badly Injured. It was certainly a
shock to our reople ob Mrs. Ballard
Is highly esteemed and loved for her
admirable traits by all thoso who
know her, nnd wo sincerely trust that
she may soon recover and not feel the
bad effects of her broken bones nnd
Hlto the bruises. We also sympath
ize with her devoted husband In tho
anguish he experiences in feeling that
ho might bo somewhat to blamo. Hopo
and despondency, pleasure and pain,
ore mingled together like sunshine
and rain.
Mr. M. J. Falslov Is a happy man,
is a result of another line boy com
ing to his homo on July 9.
Tho Twentyjfourth is to be fitting

The Liquor Question
BY HERSCHEL BULLEN
It Is said that on indlWd'ual cannot
bo legislated Into morality and right
living, that such a condition Is a
matter of education, and the handling
of the liquor question Is cited as the
proof thereof. Since the legislative
session of 1909 the liquor question
lias been a live Issue. At that time
come of our fellow citizens becniue
extremely Intemperato nnd sought to
accomplish tho desired results thru
tho crosscut routo. They demanded
tho ennctment of legislation which
was promptly denied on the grounds
that the people wore not prepared
for It, as sentiment wob not sulllcl
ently strong and united to insure Its
enforcement nnd success. Since that
Intemperate outburst somo of those
sxtromlsts have receded from their
radical position, somo have Joined
the conservatives, and It is sato to
say that all are more tempcrato and
fair minded. Wo have been study
Investigating, thinking, becoming ed
ucated, and today wo are In n much
better position to handle this big
question, tho solution of which has
taxed tho brain of tho Bhrowdest nnd
most Intellectual of our citizens for
j ears. A question with which many
of our stntes have struggled for ov
er half a century, nnd a question that
Is still In Its experimental stage, In
a great many stntes of the Union. A
question with many conflicting opln
ions, nnd one In which business mon,
capitalists, churchmen, farmers, and
citizens of all classes honestly dif
fer. Up to the year 1909, seventeen Nor
thern States had passed prohibitory
laws and 14 of tho 17 had repealed
them leaving but 3, Kansas, Maine,
and North Dakota that at that time
had strictly prohibitory laws on their
Statuto Hooks, and under these con
ditions, it is no wonder that opinions
differed as to tho best methods of
handling the liquor traffic. It Is no
wonder that the Deseret Itcws In Its
Issue of March 1, 1909, In speaking
of one of the big questions before
the legislature said: "Nothing is lost
by taking sufficient time to consider
n measure of such Importance." It
Is no wonder that tho people of Utah

jliap been slow to act, and Instead
of passlns a sweeping diastlc mens
uro that would In all probability re
sult In failure, havo built on a surer
foundation by inssliig city and coun
ty option laws.
Since the year W09 a great ninny
of our sister States have again Join
ed the dry column, nnd from current
roports it can reasonably bo accepted
that this time results aro far more
satisfactory. In our own State, nnd
especially In Cache County, tho re
sults following local option laws havo
been good, and as far ns Cache Coun
ty ii concerned, It would appear that
the reasonable and right thing to do
Is to pass n genuine state wldo pro
hibition bill during the next session
of the legislature. It is to be hoped
that other localities, have llkowiso
proved Us efficiency, nnd become con
verted to Its purpose as Cache Coun
ty has and that both Republican and
Democratic conventions will write n
state wldo prohibition plank In their
platform which will Insure n Btnto
wldo measure being written Into law
No one can gainsay but that 'lm
Republican method of handling the
liquor question has been the real
sound method. It lias been reason
able. It has been Just, temperate, pro
gressive, tho result of good Judgment
and In nccordanco with tho history
of tne people of Utah who aro patient,
tolerant and long suffering. A peo
ple that havo had n taste of drastic
laws but who are disposed to be rea
sonable and fair to nil men, notwith
standing. For seven years the liquor question
has been' prominently beforo the peo
ple:, and a great deal of ground has
beenvgajned, sentiment In favor of
Its prohibition has increased, the peo
ple want it prohibited and know- bet
ter how to handle and enforce a men
sure of such dimensions, and right
now Is tho tlmo to take preliminary
steps for the passage of such a mea
sure tho operation of which will mnke
Utah tho cleanest and best Stato in
the Union as far as the liquor traf
fic Is concerned. Let ub have a Stato
wldo prohibition bill by legislative en
actment without further controversy.

Tho starting of a fund for the mem
bers of Troop H from Cache County

The work on tho Covo power house, , I
together with the dam which will II

from the Intake of tho reservoir down I
to the powor house will bo pushed I
vigorously through tho Bummer nnd If

The Covo power houso will deliver I
