HOPE, STEELE COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, JULY 20TH, 1916. Price 5 Cts.
Allowing the rooster to run
it re of in
the summer months costs the
North Dakota farmer several
thousand dollars a year accord
ing to information received in
Grand Forks. The rooster fer
tilizes the eggs, and fertilizing
eggs develop blood rings within
36 hours, As eggs with blood
rings are unlit for food they are
responsible for heavy losses in
marketing. Since the rooster is
not necessary for eug produc
tion it is recommended that he
removed from the flock after

The Dort was built for the business
farmer. For 30 years Dort had been
building farm vehicles. He knew what
the farmer wanted for vehicles and
what he needed in an automobile.
If an automobile is going to be a business
asset to the farmer he must be able to
use it every day in the year when the
roads are deep with snow when the tem
perature is far below zero and again in
the spring when the lrost is coming out of the ground
and the mud is so deep and thick that the average
car will sink to the hubs and be hopelessly mired.
Thtt Dort is built for these conditions. It is a real
fanner's automobile. The pric.e, $665, puts it with*
in (lie reach of every business farmer. Its light
weight insures low cost of operation.
Prom every standpoint of mechanical excellence
and appearance the Dort merits a careful investi
gation of the Business Farmer.
See the Dort
at our
show rooms.
