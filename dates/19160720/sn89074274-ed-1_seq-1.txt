dead Pershing's column will be out
of Mexico within a month and the na
tional guard back home in three
months," was what a high war depart
ment official said this afternoon. He
declared further, "Minor officials are
using Villa's name to frighten Carran
za, however, Carranza is stronger in
Mexico than ever before for the rea
son that he succeeded in averting a
war with the United States and with
out injuring the dignity of the Mexi
can republic."
Chihuahua City, July 17.—Several
scattered groups of Villistas have
eluded the cordon of government
troops which surrounded them in the
Rio Florida bottoms and have reas
sembled at Tlnajas and Las Escobas,
on the road to Ojinaga, and are mak
ing their way north with the object of
making another raid on the American
border, according to confidential ad
vices to General Trevino today.
The advices, which came from Canta
Rosalio, said the outlaws skirted Chi
huahua City by traveling in small
groups to the little settlement north
east of here.
General Trevino immediately order
ed the commander of the garrison at
Ojinaga and Piedras Negras to throw
troops out in an attempt to intercept
the bandits, whose number was esti
mated at about 200.
He pointed out that the nature of
the terrain is such that some of the
outlaws might evade the government
troops and that it would be well for
military authorities on the American
side of the frontier to be especially
vigilant.
Soldier Shoots Mexican Musician
Douglas, Arix., July 17.—Private R.
Tucker, Eleventh infantry, shot and
probably fatally wounded Antonio
Rodriguez, a Mexican musician, late

bearing arms should he fail to halt
when ordered to do so.

Valley City Band Is
Attraction of Fair
Under the big cut which the Times
Record used recently, the Fargo
Forum of Monday evening ran the
following complimentary mention of
Valley City's Municipal band:
The above is a picture of the crack
Valley City Municipal band, which is
one of the attractions at the North Da
kota State fair today and tomorrow.
The band is supported by the city of
Valley City, and is one of the finest
musical organizations in the southern
part of the state. Its personnel in
cludes some of the best known musi
cians in the state.
This morning, shortly after its ar
rival here, the band serenaded The
Forum force, playing several selec
tions in front of The Forum building
at the corner of First avenue and Fifth
street north.
L. W. Hubbard, one of the well
known musical directors of the north
west is director and conductor of this
splendid organization.

Rivalry Is Drawing to Head
If you could have seen our city
mayor when that challenge from th«
"Human lath" of the city came into
his office it would have made you
heart glad. And why wouldn't il
make any red-blooded citizen of Val
ley City, who had so much as seen an
exhibition of our national sport, wipe
the sweat from his right arm and pat
the muscles of his brow, to have
such a challenge as this flung in his
face?
"Mayor May-hit-a-bal. Moe, Capt. Val
ley City Well-feds:
"In consideration whereof, the time
has arrived when we can no longer
stand the taunts and more especially
the haughty spirit of the Valley City
Well-feds, we, the udersigned, do here
by challenge yer gang to meet us on
the field (the city ball park) and there,
by humbling or more especially by be
ing humbled, decide the superiority of
you or us for the period of one year.
Weapons used to be the official for all
such occasions. Contest to be held
some evening of Ijhis week in the pres
ence of all the citizens of Valley City
and vicinity.
'Signed, Valley City Human Lath,
Doctor Curve-a-bal Palmer, Capt."
When an old leaguer, who has seen
18 years of baseball service, 11 years
of which were on the mound, and hav
ing a record of 33 strike-outs in one
day (two games), is presented with
such a challenge, you can take it for
granted that something is going to
'ppen. We're going to watch proceed
ings right sharply.
Enlarge Courses at
Agricultural College
A meeting of the state board of
regents will be held in Fargo Thurs
day and Friday when the report of the
committee which made the recent sur
vey of the educational institutions of
the state will be submitted.
The section of the report relating
to the Agricultural college in Fargo
deals with the development of agri
ultural and vocational education at
the college and preparation of teach
ers in such studies for all types of
state schools.
Practically all the major profes
sional work is to be done at the uni
versity and all the major industrial
and vocational work at the Agricul
tural college, with proper degrees.
The three normals at Valley City,
Mayville and Minot, and the Normal
Industrial at Ellendale, will continue
to prepare teachers for the elementary
grades.
The Wahpeton Science school will
he made into an industrial school of
distinctive character.
The school of forestry at Bottineau
will be made into a big agricultural
school, something on the type of the
one at Crookston, Minn.
In addition to teaching most of the
things now taught there, with the ex
ception of professional engineering,
the Agricultural college will also pre
pare teachers in agriculture, engineer
ing, home economics, dairying and
many other lines for all state schools.
These courses are to be greatly
strengthened.
By electing Miss Jensen to succeed
Miss Stoner, the department of home
economics will be built up. The agri
cultural department is to be a real
course, in which agricultural educa
tion will be featured.
Other departments will be strength
ened likewise, and students at the
college will have an opportunity of
securing training in all kinds of
power engineering courses, including
automobile, drainage, road, sanitary,
chemical, dairying, etc.
In short, the Agricultural college is
to be made industrial and vocational
to the very highest degree, and at the
same time a sufficient amount of cul
tural work is to be continued to pre
pare the boys and girls for all walks
of life.

Congress Favorable to
Larger Navy Program
Washington, July 17.—Discussion of
the naval building program in the sen
ate today brought out indications that
the construction of 16 capital war
ships within three years, eight of
them in 1917, probably will be approv
ed without material amendment.
Administration leaders hoped to
night to pass the bill before adjourn
ment tomorrow.
Both democratic and republican
leaders defended it, howev.er.
An amendment by Senator Norris to
delay construction of any of the 16
capital ships until after the close of
the European war and after failure of
efforts to create an international peace
tribunal was tabled, 45 to 11.
In support of his amendment, Sen
ator Norris declared the bill provided
for expenditures of more money for
naval construction in time of peace
than was ever spent by any nation in
the world, despite the fact that "it is
very probable that before this Euro
pean war is over the United States,
without the construction of a single
ship, will have the greatest navy in
the world."
Senator Vardaman declared con
gress was yielding to hysteria and cau
tioned against expenditure of such
vast sums for armament, until the
country's cool, normal judgment could
be consulted.
Senator Thomas opposed the con
struction of so many big ships and
urged that submarines and air craft
would be sufficient protection for a na
tion which does not contemplate war
fare.
Senator Weeks predicted that pas
sage of the naval bill would make a
change in military policy that would
overturn the peaceful spirit of Ameri
ca.
Senators Lewis, democrat, and
Borah, Weeks and Kenyon, republi
caans, spoke in favor of the measure.
Senator Borah urged that if the Unit
ed States was to enjoy the blessings
of -peace it must convince the world it
is prepared for war.
Declaring that the United States has
not a friend among the nations, Sen
ator Lewis pleaded that the people be
told the frank truth about foreign rela
tions so that they would demand an
adequate navy.
He pointed to Japan's entrance into
the war for the purpose of ousting
Germany from the far
veast
and in­
quired if anyone believed that "she
would not enforce against America
what she enforced against Germany
and call upon her present allies to help
her in a war against the United
States."
Hail Hits at Spiritwood Lake
Jamestown, July 17.—Saturday
morning the rain storm that deluged
a part of the country near Spiritwood
Lake was accompanied by hail. The
hail fell from near the James river
east to Alkali Lake, and did consider
able damage to growing crops.
In some places hail was so thick
that it could be shoveled up from
the ground. Those who suffered crop
damage from the storm were Leo and
August Gruchalla, John Thomas Rei
dell, Joe Kaiser, John Klaski, Frank
Gronk, and the Szarkoskis, both Mrs.
Szarkowski and iier brother-in-law.
Considerable rain was reported at
Buchanan also, and a severe electrical
storm passed over that town, lightning
striking the Buchanan elevator, with
small damage.
Fargo, July 18.—A couple walked in
to Judge Hanson5s office at the court
house yesterday and applied for a
marriage license.
They both gave their home as Val
ley City. When it was explained that
they should have taken out a license
in the young lady's home county, they
replied that they hadn't thought of get
ting married when they came down to
take in the fair. After their arrival
here they decided it would be more
congenial to make a honeymoon trip
out of it.
From that time the demand for bet
ter educational facilities began to be
be felt, and the community passed
through several agitations, divisions
of school districts, acquiring and re
leasing land, until the culmination was
the forming of an independent district
with Nome as a nucleus of population.
After the new district was secured sev
eral sections of land were brought
within the boundaries, bonds were is
sued, contracts let, and the finest
school building of the kind is to be
dedicated for educational purposes and
pocial uses of the community.
The school board and their advisers
have adopted a liberal policy in every
respect and not only provided a mag
nificent building, but have secured five
acres for the site in the eastern part
of the town.
This spacious plat is to be used for
a playground primarily, but in addi
tion the school pupils will be trained in
horticulture and agricultural subjects.
The building has a full basement,
above which are two stories consisting
of six classrooms, special rooms for
manual training and domestic science,
a large auditorium and a gymnasium.
It is to be furnished with all the mod
ern school paraphernalia and conven
iences. In addition to these it will be
steam heated and equipped for both
hot and cold water, toilet rooms and
sanitary provisions all around.
To do justice to the occasion there
will be a program both afternoon and
evening. The afternoon program will
start at 2 o'clock and will consist of
the following numbers:
Chorus—Flower Song School
Invocation Rev. N. I. Berg
Address of Welcome Mayor E. Lee
Vocal solo Eugene Woodhams
Address Supt. W. E. Hoover, Fargo
Violin solo...Mrs. Eugene Woodhams

After this program a ball game will
be played on the grounds, and at 6
o'clock supper will be served in the
gymnasium, and this will be free to
one and all.
The evening program will commence
at 8 o'clock, consisting of the follow
ing:

Stalling Morn" School

Commercial Club Decides on Plan
to Present to Equity Committee
The rain fell for about three hours
in a limited area of the country, but
was in the nature of a cloud burst, ao
cording to the amount of water that.
fell.
Pair Decided to Make
Fair Trip Honeymoon
They were told that if they would go
over to Moorhead a license could be
secured. The prospective groom stat
ed that would be satisfactory as they
didn't care much where they got the
license just so they got it. When last
seen they were headed for the Minne
sota side.
Nome Dedicates Modern
School Building Today
On Saturday evening, June 5, 1909,
the village of Nome was visited by a
disastrous fire that wiped out a con
siderable part of the business section.
The rebuilding of business buildings
of brick and concrete, along with ce
ment sidewalk and further improve
ments, has given the place the neatest
and cleanest appearance of any vil
lage in the state.
At the meeting of the Commercial
club Monday evening it was decided to
prepare a brief setting forth what the
city and community had to offer as
inducements to have the Equity pack
ing plant located at this point.
Lee Combs was made chairman of
the committee to prepare a statement
that would be laid before the commit
tee. Among the principal items com
posing this would be a donation of 160
acres of land for a site, the assurance
of a sufficient stock subscription, rail
road facilities, yardage, water, elec
tric power, etc., all guaranteed.
There will be a delegation of Valley
City men on hand at the meeting Fri
day to supplement the committee in
any way their services may be requir
ed.
When it comes right down to brass
tacks the only logical place for such,
a plant in North Dakota is Valley City.
To locate it at some point on the east
ern border would make it half for
Minnesota. To place it at the north
ern part of the state would be to bene
fit Canada. Valley City has any and
everything the other cities can offer,
and our central location should be the
deciding factor in favor of this city.
If the plant is to be installed for the
benefit of the stock interests of the
state at large, Valley City is the
ideal location.
SOUTH DAKOTA JOINS
IN DAMAGE SUIT
Minneapolis, July 17.—Having con
sented to South Dakota joining with
North Dakota in a proposed suit on
behalf of affected property owners and
having directed the attorney general
of South Dakota to appear in an action
to recover §1,500,000 darnags alleged
to have resulted to Dakota lands by
floods from drainage systems on the
Minnesota side near Big Stone lake,
Gov. Francis M. Byrne of South Da
kota today gave Gov. J. A. A. Burn
quist assurance that his action was
friendly in spirit.
OLD RESIDENT IS HERE
August Shilling, from the Fort Bert
hold reservation, is in the city this
week. Mr. Shilling was one of the
early residents here, and owned one
of the first blacksmith shops in Val
ley City. He has been spending the
past few days attending to matters of
business at Oriska, where he went to
live after leaving Valley City. After
a short stay here, he will return again
to the reservation,
Jamestown Alert: Monday morn
ing in district court, Ben O. Holland,
of Greenland township, Barnes county,
appeared before Judge J. A. Coffey,
and through his lawyer, the state's
attorney of Barnes county, asked for
a decree of divorce from Alice Hol
land. The decree was granted.
Jury Is Secured Monday
for Mneller Mnrder Trial
Jamestown, July 17.—After two
whole days of questioning of the ven
iremen drawn in the Mueller murder
case, and after the first panel had
been exhausted and several extra tales
men had been summoned, the jury was
completed at 11:45 today.
The following are to be in the jury
.box for the next week or two, while
the case for and against John Muelled
is argued: N. G. Anderberg, James
town Aug. Close, Jr., Jamestown H.
R. Tuthill, Jamestown Guy Oliver,
Jamestown R. H. Hamm, Jamestown
Fred Smith, Jamestown L. N. Cad
ieux, Jamestown Stephen Hamilton,
Courtenay Geo. Laing, Courtenay
John Van Henzen, Woodworth Fred
Malleck, Jamestown: Jerrv Morrisey,
Jamestown.
As soon as the jury was complete,
they were sworn by Clerk of Court
Cran and were then briefly addressed
by Judge Coffey. He said that he
wished to impress upon them the im
portance of the case and that they
were to consider only the evidence of
fered during the trial. He warned
them not to consult with each other
about the case until the trial was over,
and not to form an opinion until that
time. He also asked them not to as
sociate with any one else during the
continuance of the trial. A recess
was then taken until 2 p. m.
In opening the Mueller case Attor
ney Thorp related the circumstances
which are alleged to have surrounded
the commission of the crime. After
telling of the shooting of the Hens
family, he said that the old folks went
into the house and sent Johanna over
to a neighbor's for help. Ida ran up
stairs, very much frightened. At last
there was a knock and the old woman
said, "Is that you, father." He said,
"Yes." "Is John Mueller with you?"
"Yes." After Mueller had been made
to lay his gun down he was allowed to
come in. Then he asked to be for
given. After he got out doors, he
said, "Do you know why I shot you?
It was because I wanted to marry Jo
hanna." Then he left and was arrest
ed.
After relating the above story, Atty.
Thorp closed with a plea for impartial
judgment on the part of the jury.
