WHAT TIMES
WILL DO IN
CAMPAIGN
Candidates. near-candidates and friends of
candidates have been besieging me to learn
1 xvhat The Times U going to do" in the fall cam
paign.
The answer ought not to I>c liard to guess. Tt
is very simple. The Times is going to do every
thing in its power to see that efficient, business
like, square-shooting, coninion-sensc and forward
looking men are nominated and elected.
The Times enjoys a position occupied l>y no
other important paper in Southwest Washington.
It has no party relationships. It has nobody's
political ax to grind. Its readers know this to he
true, and for that reason rely on what we >;iy
regarding <>ffice-seckevs.
Our only tnotivt in auy campaign is that of
any other good citizen — to s''e that TacotHO,
fierce County and Southwest Washington till
Iheir offices with the highest type of men avail
able.
To that end, in this campaign we shall iMCOUf
resources to compile every fact that hears on the
candidates' fitness, and then will pass the infor
mation along to our reader*-. When we are cer
tain a candidate is unworthy, we shall say so;
when we are convinced a candidate would make a
first-class official, we will he emphatic in declaring
our belief. When we are in doubt we will say so
frankly: we do not pose as infallible.
Just now we are paying a great deal of atten
tion to the multitudinous candidates for governor,
and are printing a series of articles about each of
the republican aspirants. Sutton, Hartley and
McXeeley thus far have been treated. Frost will
be next, and the Others in turn. By the time this
series is out of the way, we shall be ready to give
our conclusions as to which of the group will best
serve the |>eople if elected.
Soon also we are going to have something to
say about the congressman situation in this dis
trict.
As the filings pile up for county and legislative
offices we will turn to a study of the men who are
asking your votes there, and, so far as we are
able to make intelligent research, will recommend
preferences.
Long ago we made it known that Senator
l'oindexter. in our opinion, deserves re-eleciton.
Our more recent announcement that we had
reached the conclusion that Wilson ought to be
re-elected president has been too widely discussed
to require further emphasis. ,
THE VOTERS ARE SICK AND TIRED
OF PETTY POLITICS, PARTY POLITICS.
BOSS POLITICS. THEY WANT MEN IN
OFFICE WHO EARN THEIR PAY. THE
TIMES IS GOING TO HELP THEM GET
THEM.

as financial assistance for the striking longshore
