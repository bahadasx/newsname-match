Fourth Annual County Fair Gives
Truiiiise of Biggest Success La
Grande Elks' Hand Kig
Attraction.
By W. V. Smead
The Fourth Annual Morrow Coun
ty Fair, insofar as products go, should
be the best ever held in the county.
Grains are better than for several
years and the farmers should and no
doubt will prepare samples of the va
rious grains lor this Fair. In doing
so they should have the bundles nut
less than 4 inches in diameter;
threshed grains should be in not less
than one half bushel lots as this is
the amount required at the state fair
and if your threshed grain is pure and
of good quality it can be entered at
the state fair with the assurance that
it will take clown some of the prizes
offered. As for vegetables and fruits,
they are far better than usual and
especially is this true of potatoes.
Morrow county should have one of
the best exhibits of potatoes ever
shown by the county and that means
much. Special prizes are being of
fered for the best general farm ex
hibit, also for the best dry land farm
exhibit and many other specials are
being arranged for, such as a colt
show, judging contests between the
ys and girls of the schools of the
inty, and a number of lectures are
being booked on matters pertaining
to the farm. Greater stress is being
given to educational features than
ever before. In the way of amuse
ment the Board promises the people
more and better free amusement than
is given at any county fair in the
state. This is a big promise but we
mean what we say. So far we have
under contract the Elks' Band of lif
toen pieces, from La Grande. This is
one of the best bands in the state and
you are assured of a musical treat.
We also have under contract Herbert
A. Munter of Seattle, with his special
aeroplane with which he makes all
kinds of fancy stunts, such as tommy
trot, figure eight and death dive. If
you want to see some thrillers come
and see this dare-devil, death-defying
aviator. He will fly Thursday and
Friday. Other attractions are under
consideration, all of the same high
class.
The Board is going to build good
substantial stock sheds with individ
ual stalls for use of the stock men
during the fair, making it much more
convenient and safe for those who
wisli to exhibit high priced stock. We
expect to make improvements in all
parts of the fair and if the people
give us the same co-operation this
year that they have in 'the years past
the fair will be the best county fair
in the state, and that is what Morrow
county should have for having taken
sweep stakes at the Land Show in
Portland last year. We have a repu
tation to sustain and the Fair Board
is going to do its part towards keep
ing this reputation.

VETERINARiAN DISCUSSES Sill
OF WALKING DISEASES AMONG HORSES
By V. H. LYTLE.
At the present time the so-called
Walking Disease seems to be in some
sections quite active. No sure cure
has yet been found. Some apparent
ly beneficial treatments have been
worked out however. The disease is
such that when once it manifests it
self medical aid is difficult. It is like
Infantile Paralysis, there is yet a few
things to be learned about it. It
would seem that the malady is a form
of infection that comes out of the
ground. The organism that we sus
pect as being responsible for this ail
ment is found everywhere and under
normal conditions does not produce
disease. But through some chain of
circumstances it becomes infectious.
It has lately been brought out that
the Bot parasite of the stomach of
horses is either highly poisonous
within itself or possesses some poison
that works In conjunction with other
non-disease-producing organism and
facilitates their producing a diseased
condition. It is possible that the bots
themselves produce the poison, al
though it seems to me quite improba
ble. We attempt first to vaccinate and
protect horses against the particular
organism, that of Hemorrhagic Sep
ticemia, then we attempt to rid the
system of the excess of bots. Bots
are very difficult to get out of the
stomach; they are attached to the in
ner lining by a sort of double hooked
snout that is burrowed into the lining
of the stomach. To be effective bot
remedies should be given on an emp
ty stomach. We recommend giving
one-half ounce to three quarters of an
ounce of Tartar Ementic dissolved in
water. It can be given by placing it
in the drinking water. Animals al

After shooting down J. L. Eggers
in a dispute over sheep which he was
tending, Bert Hopkins left the body
in care of another fellow herder then
gathered his sheepherder's outfit and
went to Durkee, where he gave him
self up Tuesday afternoon.
After telling his story the man
nearly collapsed under a - nervous
breakdown. Hopkins is only 24
years old. He was herding sheep for
Amos Roetther, and was near Eggers'
homestead at 1 ociock, when Eggers
appeared and ordered him to move
his sheep, although Hopkins declares
the animals were on government
range.
He says Eggers seized him, but that
he wrenched himself free and retreat
d toward the sheep, Eggers following
him pelting him with rocks and curs
ing him. Without taking aim Hopk
ins says he fired his rifle, intending
only to cause Eggers .to desist. As
the crack of the rifle sounded he was
horrified to see Eggers stagger and
topple over to the ground. The bul
let had entered his chest, supposedly
piercing the heart, y
District Attorney Goodwin, Deputy
Sheriff Nelson, Constable Jefferies
and Coroner West went from Baker
o Durkee and took Hopkins in charge
then went to the scene of the shoot
ing, seven miles beyond, and held an
inquest. Eggers is survived by a
widow and three children.
Hopkins will be held for the grand
jury and probably tried on a man
slaughter charge.
On request of the defense arraign
ment of Hopkins has been continued
over to Monday. The desire of the
prisoner to get additional witnesses
from Durkee is the cause of the de
lay. John L. Rand is representing
Hopkins. Blue Mt. American. ...

Morrow County Fair
Dates
SEPTEMBER 14th, 15th, 16th. '16
At Heppner, Oregon
lowed to stand over night without
ed or water will generally drink the
dedicated water in the morning. One
fwner who had lost twelve horses fol
lowed out the Tartar Ementic treat-
!ient after the horses had been vac
inated and also gave two teaspoon
fuls of sulphur in the feed or fait for
f period of time and also placed a
Quantity of lime in his well and wa
tering trough and has lost no horses
Since. His treatment was directed
against the bots and apparently it has
been productive of good results. We
can recommend nothing better than
this line of treatment. At the pres
ent writing we are unable to get any
more vaccine before the last of the
week. It is possible that the bot
treatment will be sufficient. The Tar
tar Ementic can be given for two or
three days. One owner placed it in
fils watering trough. If Tartar Em
entic can not be had, by placing one
ounce of carbolic acid on a pound of
salt and mixing it and feeding it to
the horses a good substitute and bot
remedy will be had. The sulphur
feeding for several days afterwards
will tend to remove any remaining
bots. Horses that are ailing should
be given this treatment and if the
bowels are not well regulated a half
(Ounce dose of crude eurotropine
should be given night and morning.
Dissolve this in water and drench.
Horses should be placed on succulent
feeds such as alfalfa hay or rye pas
ture. I would recommend not to
take horses to the mountains as there
is more infection in the mountains
than in other parts. Separate appar
ently diseased animals from the well.
The urine is thought to carry the infection.

CAMPERS ARE READY
f ' Pieereation maps of the Deschutes,
Ochoco, Oregon, Siskiyou, Siuslaw
and Umatilla National Forests or Ore
gon, and the Chelan, Olympic and
Washington National Forests of
Washington have been completed by
the Department of Agriculture, and
' are now being distributed to those
who desire them. These maps show
the available roads and trails, the lo
cation of ranger stations, lookout sta
tions, and other points of interest on
the oFrests. A special map of the
Columbia Gorge Park in Oregon is al
so being distributed.
j On the back of these maps are
printed a description of the Forest
and other Information of value to
j campers and tourists, together with
rules regarding forest fires and the
, sanitation of camps.
It is planned to prepare and print
similar maps of the remaining Na
tional Forests until all are covered.
The maps are especially useful to
hunters, fishermen, campers and tour-
( ists on the National Forests. Copies
may be obtained from the District
j Forester, Portland, Oregon, or from
the Supervisor of any Forest for
which the map has been published.
Claud Devine is a young farmer
north of lone who certainly deserves
success, and if hard licks will bring
it he will come out on top. Desiring
to get a start in the farming game
for himself, he leased three quarter
sections of land last fall and begun
operations. He had no teams and
implements to work with and had to
hire his plowing done. Getting a
half section plowed he hired a drill
and man and teams to help and got
the grain In in good season this
spring, the hired man running the
drill during the day and he putting
the machines through during the
night. His crop has matured well
and he is now getting it headed and
should have at the least calculation
15 bushels to the acre. He has 160
acres of good summer-fallow ready
for fall sowing, besides. He will make
a good profit off his first year's work
despite the difficulties under which he
has labored. Mr. Devine Is a hustler
and will make good as a farmer.

W. r. Palmateer was up from Mor
gan yesterday. He has just pur
chased a new thresher and will help
his neighbours in caring for their
grain crop this season. Many head
ers are now busy in that locality and
the crops there will be abundant and
of very excellent quality.
Sunday's rain was certainly a soak
er and the weather since has been
ideal. This rain was just what is
needed to finish up the spring grain
in good shape, and every farmer you
meet now has a smile on his coun
tenance that reaches from ear to ear
and extends down the back of his
neck. '
Everybody getting busy for harvest
now. Cutting has begun with many in
this vicinity and the coming week will
see many more in the fields with their
headers. Nothing but the best of re
ports are coming in as to crop con
ditions. Morrow county will market
the largest crop of good wheat in her
history this fall.
Mr. Jesse Ray Beezley and Miss El
vina Davidson were married on Sat

of the week from a trip to the Milton
and Walla Walla country. He took
the family of Geo. Parman to their
home at Milton, and while in that sec
tion made a number of trips in and
out of Walla Walla in various direc
tions and took note of the crop con
ditions up that way, as well as on the
reservation lands in Umatilla county,
and it is opinion that Morrow county
has the whole section badly beaten
this year on crops. Their yield will
not be above one half of their stan
dard of other years in the opinion of
Mr. Anderson.
Charley Devin was in town Tues
day after extras for the combine har
vester. He will begin his harvest
the coming week and expects to be
one busy man for many weeks to
come. His grain will yield well and
may make as high as twenty-five
hus
oft
bushels to the acre. Ed Engelman,
the same neighborhood, is also get-
ting into his harvest and has the
promise of as big a yield, and from
samples that we have seen of his
grain it should go thirty bushels at
least. Throughout that section of
the county the grain crop is all of this
quality: No. 1 wheat, running from
twenty to thirty bushels to the acre.
This is present indications and the
crop is now so far made as to make
this a safe estimate.
RURAL CREDITS AGT
WILL AIG FARMERS
Measure Xow Pending Would Mean
Annual Havings of Over $750,000.
Oregon Agricultural College, Cor
vallis, July 18.- An annual saving of
interest and mortgage cost in excess
of three-quarters of a million dollars
annually, is expected to result from
the operation of the pending rural '
credits bill if it is enacted by the peo
ple at the next annual election. "But
this is rot all," says Dr. Hector Mac
pherson, of the 0. A. C. Bureau of
Organization and Markets, in discuss
ing this bill. "It means an end to
the perpetual worry and expense of
mortgage renewing. It means an
end to foreclosing, lost homes and
blighted hopes. It means better
equipped farms and a greater rural
prosperity. This in turn means more
business for railroads, factories aud
stores and more work for laborers in
our cities.
"Although agriculture Is the basic
industry of Oregon, our farmers are
now far from being prosperous. In
adddition to high interest rates the
long and expensive freight hauls to
distant markets and inflated land val
ues have placed Oregon agriculture
under an almost unbearable handicap.
It is estimated that the average Ore
gon farm is not making wages at two
percent on the investment represent
ed. "The farm debt of Oregon secured
by real and chattel mortgage is es
timated conservatively at $30,000.
000. On this debt the farmers are
paying an average rate of about 8 '4
per cent interest. Adding to this the
cost of renewal and commission the
average rate is probably but little un
der 9 i per cent.
"It is the purpose of the proposed
constitutional amendment to take the
burden out of the farm mortgage cu
bus of the state. It proposes to give
the farmer a period of 36 years in
which to pay his mortgage. The ac
tual rate of interest is 5 per cent. The
cost of title and land appraisal varies
from $10 to $50. The farmer pays
off one percent of the original sum
borrowed each year, that is a pay
ment of six per cent a year will be
sufficient to pay the interest and cost
of operation and wipe out the debt
entirely in a period of thirty-six
years.
"The system is inexpensive. The
loan funds will be supplied on tho
credit of the state, which can obtain
lower rates of interest and better
terms than any of its sub-divisions or
any individual. The cost of opera
tion in loaning the state school funds
is only two-tenths of one per cent and
this system will be handled in much
the same way by the state land
board."
