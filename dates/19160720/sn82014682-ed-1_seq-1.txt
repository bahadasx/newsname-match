Party Harmony Can Only Be
Reached -By. Having All Mr
: tcrests Fairly Dealt With
mll A. Berndt, interviewed this
morning on the subject of his atti
tude on resigning the chairmanship
'of the Republican' party, made; the
following statement;
J'jn view of misleading atatements
that have been made, I desire to em
phatically confirm previous state
menu to the effect that unless It can
be arranged to effect a reorganlta
tion of the central committee whereby
party harmony can be reached by ha v.
ing all elements In the community
equitably represented, I am convinced
that my efforts would not be attend
ed with success, ".'and therefore feel
It Incumbent, to tender my resigna
tion in order that those responsible
for the present organization, and who
are in favor of continuing it, may
have entire Control and the responsi
bility that goes with.it ,
"I believe that the committee was
fairly chosen, so far as the voting
was concerned, but without due de
. liberation and that It will be readUy
appreciated that the business : com
munity js not adequately represented.
Perhaps the fault for, this lies more
w ith the business community " than
anywhere else; nevertheless 1 believe
It would be wisdom on . the part of
those In control to see,, that it ia given
representation. I bave' naturally, re
garded that my greatest opportunity
for service to the party would be
throe securing the united support
' V of the business people, and without
a - fair, chance of accomplishing this,
my. greatest means for usefulness has
. - ', been-'-'deetrcyed; tMf v,
"Let those who believe that party
interests are paramount give due
ccnsidcr&troa to the rights of all to
fair represcnUtica. . i ; :
Chairman Bernit's statement 'cor
reEponds" precisely-to the situation as
" outlined by the Star-Bulletin yester
. , day afternoon.- Since that time sev
eral "harmony . conferences" ; have
i. -aken place. John II. Wise, who was
rromlnent la the late platform con
vcctlon, has worked particularly hard
to bring , about harmony. . '
It Is conceded by all the party lead-J
crs wno nave followed, the develop
nents that the party is on the verge
of a big split hi split with the so-
called VstneBs community oa one
side and the rank .and .file of old
time Hepublican voters On the other.
Predictions were made today that
unless .Chairman Berndt'a attitude
brings about a reorganization of the
central committee, he and others win
; resign and the substantial Republic
ans who have ' almost ; always aided
the campaign la the past will decline
to have anything to do "with the cam-

' WASH LNQTON, D. Cn July 1 6.
Judge T. B. Stuart of Hawaii rigged
up a bomb ..and touched it off."; Tlu
purpose was to shake the govera
mental foundcMOns, biuwing Secre
tary Line. Attorney General Gregory
and Governor Pinkham out of the
water.- Incidentally, it was calculated
to jostle the President of the United
States. -.: : . -
The net result of the explosion wfa
to disturb nobody and efrect nothing.
It did not make a ripple on the sur
face of the water. : No public men
tion was made of the matter. The
newspapers did not carry a line of
the Judge's letter.' , - . - ''
Governor , Pinkham, with Judges
Robertson and Whitney, will not hear
of the bomb except rrom 'unofficial
sources. The shock. will - not reach
them. Judge Stuart, after this bomb
throwing, ' could not achieve the gov
ernorship Inside of a million years.
His attack on Secretary Lane and At
torney General Gregory had no effect
other than to materially strengthen
Governor Pinkham and the members
of the bench assailed. -,
"Governor Pinkham Is a queen com
Vared with Judge Stuart" is the way
in which the situation is described by
Interior department people. :
Judge Stuart began the formulation
of his letter a week before its promul
tatlon. Ie acquired a press bureau
in the shape of three or four aggres
sive young reporters. With them he
conferred and to them he read the
rough draft of his letter. Finally he
rounded it and took xt to the White
House In person, lie marked it "per
sonar and left it for the president
with one of the attaches. It was ten
derly laid, on Mr. Wilson's desk and
left for his perusal Up to that time
it has neither been referred to Seen
tary ? Lane nor to Attorney General
Gregory. '."; -, ..V: ....'- -Sy;,:;. '
Department of justice officials em
phatically declare that Judge Stuart's
resignation will be accepted the min
ute It comes Into their hands. At
present it has another string attached
to it . He advises the president that
it will be submitted Anerust 1.... The
authorities here sincerely hope that
his promise will be redeemed. .
