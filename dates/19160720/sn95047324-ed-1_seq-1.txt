of State Polk Tuesday, just before
the latter went to the White
House for the Cabinet meeting.
It is understood Mr. Arredoudo
had received instructions from
his government approving a ten
tative plan for the settlement of
the differences with the United
States by means of a joint inter
national commission.
Members of the Cabinet after
their meeting said that whether a
commission would be agreed upon
to settle the differences the ques
tion had not been fully determin
ed. General Funston asked the War
Department for $500,000 to con
struct temporary shelters for
army horses and mules along the
bonier.

Forest Problems of South Diseas
ed by Chief Forester
In an address before the South
ern Forestry Congress at Ashe
ville on July 11, llwiry S. Graves,
Chief Forester of the United Stat
es, emphasized the importance of
the timber supply of th;? South
and pointed out methods by which
it may be perpetuated.
"Nowhere in the whole United
States," said Mr. Graves, "can
the naval stores industry or the
protection of hardwood timber be
carried on with the same natural
and economic advantages as in
the Southeast. Forests occupy
more than half the total land area
of the. South. Southern pine is the
principal softwood used in fully
two-thirds of the country east of
the plains. Backed by a supply of
some 325 billion feet of yellow
pine and about 20,000 sawmills,
the pine industry holds today a
commanding place in the coun
try's lumber market. By their
very magnitude the forest prob
lems of the South command atten
tion." In addition to the value of the
limber, the southern pineries, said
Mr. Graves, furnish annually a
bout 35 million dollars worth of
tudpentine, rosin, etc. This income
is in danger of being entirely lost
through failure to properly care
for and perpetuate the forests.
"The turpentine industry of
France is a man-made indus
try. A century ago the barren
sand-dunes could be bought at
any price one was willing to pay.
Today the poorest pine land cov
ered with 2-year seedlings sells
for $90.00. Stocked with 30-year
old pine it is worth $80, and with
50-year old $160" an acre. In this
country the turpentine industry
has had the advantage of a great
natural forest. Instead of being
founded fin preserved by the dil
igence fo man. its destruction will
1 be brought about unless steps are
I taken to perpetuate it. The grow-
poses IS a proiuauiu uuuei-iaKuig
at present.
' Sixty-one per cent of the hard
wood supply of the country is lo
cated in the South, Mr. Graves
pointed out. Moreover, many of
the most important . hardwoods
are supplied wholly by the south
ern forests. The Appalachian re
gion now produces about fifty per
cent of the hardwoods used in the
country, and forms the chief re
maining source of supply. At the
present rate of cutting the exist
ing supply of high-grade hard
wood timber will not last .for
manv years. Under proper meth
ods, however, the Southern Appalachian-
region alone can be
made to grow four-fifths of the
hardwood timber which wc now
require.
There is no great need, said Mr.
Graves, for more of the States to
provide for forest fire protection
under the-Weeks Law, in coop
eration with the National Govern
ment. The lumber companies
should also combine to prevent
fires in their holdings. This can
best be done by protective associa
tions such as have been formed
elsewhere."
Once the-fire problem is control
led the possibilities of forestry in
the South are almost unlimited.
When the people of the South
wake up to the value of the re
sources at stake and take neces
sary steps to prevent their de
struction and waste, the forests of
the South may be made to yield a
continuous supply of lumber and
other products.
In Mexico it may be necessary
to set the clock up a coule of hun
dred years in order to bring that
country up to date.

GROVE INSPECTION LAWFUL
Supreme Court Uphold Action of
the Plant Board
iwo recent decisions of the Su
preme Court of Florida are of
much interest and importance to
the citrus growers of the State
Tl - 4 1 -1 . .
xjoui decisions were in cases
brought against the State Plant
Board in connection with the
work of eradicating citrus canker.
In one case the owner of a cit
rus grove requested an injunction
restraining the inspectors of the-
i lant Board from inspecting his
property for citrus canker, alleg
ing that the Florida Plant Act of
I91o, authorizing such inspection,
was unconstitutional. The Circuit
Court of Dade County held the
Plant Act to be constitutional and
sustained a demurrer to such bill.
and upon an appeal, the Supreme
iourt athrmed the decision of the
court below.
In the other cases certain nurs
vijiiu-u wnose citrus nurseries
were located' within one mile of
infected property, and hence un
der quarantine by the provisions
of rule 5 of the Plant Board, filed
a bill to enjoin the enforcement of
such rule, and praying for its
modification so as to permit the
movement of nurserv stock situ
ated within an infected zone, al
though such nursery stock might
have been subject to infection, if
in fact it Tid not show, upon in
spection, evidence of infection.
To this Bill the Attorneys for the
Plant Board filed a demurrer, con
tending the Circuit Court was
without jurisdiction to control the
discretion of the' Plant Board or
review its findings, or to grant the
relief prayed, and that there was
no equity in the bill. The Circuit
Court overruled this demurrer,
but the Supreme Court reversed
the decision of the Court below,
holding that such bill did not
state any grounds for equitable
relief, and that no facts were al
leged showing that the State
Plant Board, in making and en
forcing Rule 5, had exceeded its
authority.
FARM AND GROVE IN FLORIDA
Agricultural News Service University of Florida
College of Agriculture
Cultivation
of Sweet
Pays
Potatoes
Sweet potatoes are so easily
raised that they usually . raise
themselves. The average farmer
Iconsiders his task completed when
he sets the plants, according to C.
K. McQuarrie, state agent for the
University of Florida Extension
Division. Sweet potatoes do not
need much cultivation, but the lit
tle they do need is essential.
There is probably no crop which
will respond more generously to
a little care.
After the vines -have formed
and covered the bead they can be
depended upon to care for the
weeds and grass,. but until then
thoy should be cultivated. Until
the plants become established
they are not capable of compet
ing with weeeds and are apt to be
smothered or stunted. With a lit
tle cultivation they will make
quicker growth and an earlier
crop.
Cultivation should be continued
only until the vines have become
large enough to cope with the
weeds. If it is given later than
this it is apt to interfere with the
formation of potatoes and with
the root system.
Caterpillars
Attack
Potatoes
Sweet
Caterpillars attack sweet pota
toes almost every year. In some
sections they may not be trouble
some but in others they may de
foliate the crop. They are between
one and two inches long and are
marked with broad dark, narrow
orange, and brown stripes: They
feed on the leaves of sweet pota
toes and on a number of other
plants.
They may be controlled in the
sweet potato field by poisons, ac
cording to J. II.- Watson, cntomol
ogist to the University of Florida
Experiment Station. Lead arse
nate is probably the best poison.
Use one pound of the powder or
two pounds of the paste to 50 gal
lons of water. Spray the vines
until they arc thoroughly wet. If
dusting is preferred, each part of
the lead arsonate powder should
be mixed with four parts of air
slaked lime. Dust the leaves
until they are well covered with
the mixture.
One treatment is usually
enough. However, if the first is
not thoro another will be neces
sarv. The broods are about a
month apart.
Plants With Pot Bound Roots
Do Not Thrive
F. F. Ilahna, assistant horticul
turist to the University of Florida
Experiment Station recommends
thai potted plants be examined oc
casionaly to see whether their
roots are 'not bound.If upon re
moving the plant from the pot the
roots are massed around the out
siue of the soil.a larger uot should
be provided. 1 f, however, a larger
pot is impracticable the roots may
be sheared, new soil introduced
and the plant replaced in the
same pot.
During the rainy season is a
good time to transfer plants and
they are apt to need repoting ow
ing to the growth made during
spring and summer.
Where soil is needed for flower
pots, Mr. Malma recommends e
qual parts of muck soil, well rot
ted manure, and sharp sand. If
thtse ingredients are not avail
able a good garden soil will servc.
A small plant should not be plac
ed in too large a pot because the
soil is apt to sour. It is better to
repot as the plant grows.
Bradford Knapp, of the Unit
ed States department of agricul
ture, says that the average farm
value of the hay per acre in most
of the cotton states was more than
the farm value of the cotton in the
fall of 1914. In 1915 thevalue of
hay produced per acre was greter
than the value of cotton produced
per acre in some of the cotton stat
es. Wonder why more folks do
not raise hay?
Stem End Rot Likely to Follow
Scale Insects
Scale insects not only damage
citrush fruit themselves, but they
are likely to be the forerunners
of stem end rot. Stem end rot is
caused by a fungus which is un
able to enter the' fruits except
where a wound or weakened! tis
sues give them entrance. That
the disease is usualy found at the
stem end is because it finds con
ditions for entrance favorable
there. "
. Scala insects usually collect at
the stem end and weakenn the tis
sues around the stem. Since the
spores of the fungus are usually a
bundant infection is almost sure
to occur if the. disease has been
in the grove during a year or two
previous. The fruit drops and de
cay sets in. If infection occurs
late in the season decay may not
develop until after the fruit is
picked' and shipped.
II. E. Stevens, plant patholog
ists the University of Florida-Experiment
Station, recommends
that growers watch closely for
scale insects. If they become
numerous they should be sprayed
with a good contact insecticide.
Spraying may have to be repeat
ed once or twice to keep the truit
from scales until the picking sea
son. Pruning the dead wood is also
a good precaution. The fungus
lives over in dead wood and is rea
dy to infect fruit when favorable
conditions arise. Dead wood
should be removed and burned.
This will lessen greatly the chanc
es for spread of the disease. ,
Budwood Must Not Be Removed
Without Inspection
Under the Florida Plant Act of
1915 and under the nursery in
spection laws of practically every
state, budwood is considered nurs
ery stock. The reason for this
classification is obvious when one
remembers that insect pests and
disease can be transferred as easi
ly on budwood as on nursery
stock. Growers and nurserymen
who wish to move budwood
should apply for inspection to F.
M. O 'Bryan, nursery inspector to
the State Plant Board, Un ivcrsity
of Florida,' Gainesville. If the
wood is clean permission will be
given to move it.
To move stock without certifi
cation is a violation of the law
and offenders can be held respon
sible. Jt is probable that some
growers and nurserymen have not
thought of budwood as nursery
stock. If this had been under
stood a great deal of trouble
could have been avoided. The
movement of budwood has been
responsible for the introduction of
cottony cushion scale, scaly bark.
canker and other citrus diseases
into many communities where
such disoases did not exist for
merly.
The regulations apply not only
to wood sold to another nerson.
but also to wood moved from one
property to another. Inspection
must be made before the stock
can be moved.
Pure Culture Method of Apply
ing r ungi Apparneuy jsucccess
Several weeks ago the county
agents of the citrus counties met
at Lakeland with Frank Sterling
of the State Plant Board to re
ceive instructions in the applica
tion of pure cultures of whitefly
fungi. The Board is furnishing
pure cultures of the red fungus at
cost, because restrictions have
been placed on the transportation
of fungus material from one
grove to another.
A. P. Spencer, district agent for
the University of Florida Exten
sion Division, reports that the re
sults obtained by agents in dis
tributing the material have been
satisfactory.. In Brevard coun
ty the agent, A. R. Nielson. has
sprayed the material into several
groves and has found a rapid dis
tribution of the fungus. He be
lieves that this method is much
more rapid than the old method
of placing the mateiral in the trees
on loaves and twigs.
Pure culture eliminates thepos
sibility of introducing diseases
A number of diseases could be car
ried to a grove on cultures that
were not pure or on dried fungus
material from other groves.
Expose Grown Roots of Foot Rot
Trees
'oot-rot of trees always devel
ops rapidly when the soil and at
mosphere are moist. It is advis
able to keep the crown roots ex
posed and especially during the
rainy season, according to A. P.
Spencer, district agent for the U
nivcrsity of FloridaExtension Di
vision. This allows the areas to
dry out and hence checks the dis
ease. . Sometimes further treat
ment U given by applying-Aver-narius
Carbolinoum.
Mr. Spencer says that a great
many of old foot-rot groves in
Florida that were almost past
bearing have been brought back
to profitable bearing. About the
only treatment those trees were
given was the removal of the
earth from the crown roots.
Crop Residues . Harbor Disease
k i , i I.
The favorite resting place for
diseases which attack plants is in
the remains of thosc pla,, which
arc left in the field after harvest.
It is customary to leave the cull
fruits and stems of spring truck
crops in the fieldf. Any diseases
which attack those crops are thus
encouraged to attack future
crops. Insects and the spores of
fungus diseases are capable of
living over in the residue of
spring crops or in the soil., They
arc thus ready to attack when an
other crop is planted.
C. K. McQuarrie, state agent
for the University of Florida Ex
periment Station, suggests that
the remains of such crops be col
lected and destroyed as sooon as
the harvest is over. To leave them
in the field invites failure. The
winters are not cold enough to in
terfere with most diseases and in
sects and they gradually accumu
late unless something is done to
hold them in check.
THE CITRUS CANKER FIGHT
Less Canker in State Today Than
in Dade County a Year Ago
Today there is less citrus cank
er infection in the whole State of
Florida than there was in half o
the county of Dado twelve month
ago. This is the highly plcasuig
information divulged by mem
ot the State. Plant Board, which
met in Jacksonville Monday.
Within a little more than a yea
the btato Plant Board, with the
cooperation of the governmriet
and individuals, has practically
rkJ the state of citrus canker.They
have within this marvelously
short time practically saved the
State trom one of the most de
structive plant diseases known
and saved for Florida one of her
greatest assets, her citrus fruit in
dustry.
May, 1915, the Florida Legisla
ture created the State Plant
Board, and approiated $65,000 a
year for two years to be expended
in the eradication of citrus cank
er. Added to this something
like $15U,UUU was given by the
Federal government and althougl
this latter sum was appropriated
only a tew months ago it has been
practically expended.
Because the Board, with the
State and Federal appropriations,
had a fair amount of money to op
erate along well organized and ex
tensive lines, it has been enabled
to make wonderful progresss. It
has curbed a pest that threatened
to destroy the citrus canker indus
try of the State in its entirety.
The members, of the Plant
Board and the others whose effic
ient work and judgement is evi
dent in the great progress made
in the. eradication, work, are all
deserving of highestT praises. The
former give their services to the
State and their only hope of re
ward is the knowledge that their
efforts are appreciated, that they
have performed faithfully and
well. Jacksonville Metropolis.

BRITISH GAIN
MORE GROUND
ALLIES' CRUSHING OFFENSIVE
On East Front Russians Reach the
Lipa, the Teutons Retiring in
Disorder that Closeiy
Resembles a Rout
London, Eng. The British
army made substantial progress
Tuesday north of Ovillers, while
the Germans utilized a temporary
lull in making nn attempt to re
gain lost ground at Biaches and
La Masionette, where the French
forces had pushed them back in
the first rush of the Anglo-French
offensive. Fighting in this region
continues.
General von Linsingen's retire
ment accross the Lipa River on
the Eastern front is considered by
critics as removing the last seri
ous obstacle to the advance of the
Russians toward Lemberg. Re
ports from Rome say the retire
ment of the Teutonic Allies has
caused a panic in Galicia, where
towns are being evacuated. The
lvussian official communication re
fers to the withdrawal as having
been in disorder, notwithstanding
German declarations that it was
accomplished unhampered by the
Russians.
While the adverse -weather is
compelling a lull in the fighting
on the Western front, military
critics are taking stock of the sit
uation. They are agreeably sur
prised by the large captures of
heavy armament that General
Ilaig, the British commander-in-chief,
has announced.
The critics point out how the
British attacks have been pressed
with the greatest rapidity in or
der to give the Germans no timo
to organize formidable defenses.
Also as was evidenced by the
withdrawal of the British from
the Foreaux wood, where they
had reached the German third
line, General Haig wisely resisted
the temptation to hold on to thnt
point. It would have incurred
severe fighting, with probably
heavy losses, and General Haig ,
was in favor of a more methodi
cal advance.
Evidence received from the
front, as well as the official map
published here, seems to prove
that the German second line of
defenses was far less strong and
elaborate than the first. There
fore, the military observers said,
they believed obstacles are likely
to be loss difficult as the Entento
Allies advance.
A Paris dispatch says, unofficial
advices from Saloniki, under date
of July 17, says cannonading is in
progress along the entire Saloniki
front.
Organized labor of England re
sponded to the Government's ap
peal to postpone the August holi
days so that the British offensive
may be carried on with no short
age of ammunition. At a con
ference of representatives of
trades unions it was decided un
animously to recommend that tho
Government's suggestion be a
dopted. The cost of printing paper has
risen so high as to drive many
newspapers out of business and
impose a grievous burden on all
of tho rest. It would "be an ax
iom in the newspaper world that
the subscription price just about
paid for the white paper used.
Today the price at which most
newspapers are sold does not
come anywhere near paying for
the paper in them. The cost of
paper has nearly doubled. Many
papers which made a fair profit
a year or two ago are now pub-
lshcd at a loss, for this reason a-
one, and yet many subscribers
are grouchy about paying their
subscriptions and some won't pay
at all. Polk Co. Record.
