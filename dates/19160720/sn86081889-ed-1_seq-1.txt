Last Thursday's Storm Killed Cattle,
Knocked Horses Down, Wrecked a
Barn, Damaged a Dwelling.
During a severe electrical storm
that passed over this portion of
theCounty Thursday afternoon of
last week, lightning struck an
apple tree on Clark McGovern's
farm in Tod township and three
head of cattle that were stand
ing near the tree were killed.
The cattle were the property of
John F. Mackey, tenant on the
McGovern farm. Mr. Mackey
carried insurance on his live
stock. The cattle killed were
Holstcins, two cows and a steer.
Lightning followed the tele
phone wires into Mrs. Margaret
Johnston's residence in Ayr town
ship, putting the phone out of
commission and tearing off sev
eral boards where the wires en
tered the building. No one was
seriously injured in the house.
Down on one ofSamuel Mellotts
farms in Ayr township, a bolt
struck the comb of the roof on
the barn. The slate on one Bide
of the barn was ripped off along
one end of the building down to
the eaves and on the opposite
side, the slate was torn off in
spots as the lightning followed
over and under the roof like a
needle. The upper story end
wall of the barn was so badly
split and wrecked that the remo
val of the hay in the full mow
was necessary before workmen
could repair it. The farm is ten
anted by Baltzer Cutchall whose
horses were in the stable at the
time. One of the animals was
knocked down and jammed un
der the manger. He had to be
assisted to his feet. The horse
was badly cut about the head,
due to the objects with which it
came in contact when it fell head
first under the manger. Anoth
er horse that had gotten out af
ter the shock, was found in the
yard with some hide missing
from its back. The one render
ed helpless, was crazy the next
morning.'
John F. Mason.
John F. Johnson, a well known
citizen of Taylor township, died
last Sunday morning at the home
of a neighbor, Orlando Wagner,
after an illness of five or six
weeks resulting from a complica
tion of diseases. The funeral
took place Tuesday afternoon at
Mr. Wagner's home, the services
being conducted by Rev. Reidell,
of the M. E. church, and inter
ment was made at Hustontown.
Mr. Johnson was a son of Da
vid and Susanna Johnson, and
he was born on the old Johnson
homestead (now the Scott Fruit
Farm) in Thompson township on
the 5th day of April, 1S46; hence
he was aged 70"years, 3 months
and 11 days. '
The deceased was married to
Miss Jennie Blair, who survives,
together with two sons, Lee B.,
and Dowling both married and
residing in Pittsburgh.
Accident at Quarry.
Last Saturday, John P. Con
rad met with an accident at the
State Highway stone quarry east
f town. They had put in a
blast and the men were leaving
the quarry when rock slipped
down from near the top and it
caught them about the legs.
'Squire Conrad's left leg was
bruised below the knee so that
he was unable to walk. , Geo.
McEldowney was caught, but he
was not severely injured, and he
brought Conrad to town in a bug
gy. Library Books.

books presented to the Scout Li

Parsonage within the next two

books will be offered to the High
School library. Robt. E. Peter-man.
Little Talks on Health and Hjgicne by
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Bcaltli.
The present habit of turning
night into day in our highly illu
minated towns, with all sorts of
exciting entertainment, keeps
the nerves keyed up and upsets
the equilibrium.-
Children, especially, are apt to
suffer from late hours and conse
quent lack of sleep. For the
first two years of life, eating and
sleeping are two great essentials.
Babies should sleep from fi f-
teen to twenty hours out of the
twenty-four; and older children
from ten to fourteen hours. It
is not an unusual thing to see ba
bies, in arms of very young chil-
dren, being carried about until
their parents' bed time. This is
injurious to the children and can
not be made up by additional rest
the next day.
Permitting children to remain
up late is a strain on their ner
vous system which, while it may
not be immediately apparent, is
bound to exert a detrimental in
fluence in the long run. Often
times the ill effects are perfectly
apparent to the intelligent ob
server. Irritableness and any of the
train of evils which result from
an overtaxed nervous system may
result from contindally robbing
the child of sleep. A regular
bed time should be set for chil
dren according to their age, rang
ing from six o'clock for babies,
to eight for children of eight or
nine, and this should be regular
ly adhered to. This is a matter
of the utmost importance in es
tablishing a sturdy constitution
in childhood.
With adult3, irregularity and
short hours of sleep are often a
factor which predisposes to ill
health. There are exceptions to
this as to all rules. Occasionally
one will find an individual who
has an unusual capacity for work
with less than the ordinary a
mount of rest, but for the ordi
nary man or woman this would
end disastrously.
Nelson Dorse Wins.
Monday's Harrisburg Patriot
says that one of the largest
crowds in the history of racing
at Carlisle, turned out to witness
the midsummer event at the Car
lisle Gentlemen's Driving Asso
ciation, held at Carlisle last Sat
urday. Several of the races were
well contested, and the result, in
at least one of the others, was a
big surprise, George Nelson, a
green horse owned by George K.
Nelson, of Newville, winning in
straight heats in the 2:30 pace
over horses that had raced for
years. The Nelson horse won
over three competitors; Kid Har
vey, owned by John Witmer, of
New Kingdom; Happy Jack own
ed by William Deitch, . Carlisle,
and Lady McKay, owned by E.
G. Eppley, Carlisle." George's
horse made the first heat in 2:271
the second, 2:31, and the third,
in '2:281.
The Nelson horse will appear
on the tracks in Altoona on the
9th of August.
Five tlollars a Day.
Mr. M. M. Brakeall, of Dra
vosburg, Pa., accompanied by
Allen Brakeall, Rush Whitten
and E. A. Gisel all of the same
place, stopped in McConnellsburg
a few hours last Friday as they
were enroute in an automobile to
the Gettysburg battlefield. They
were making the trip through in
one day and had plenty of time
to rest. "Mart" as he was fa
miliarly known in his boyhood
days is a. native of Thompson
township, and went to school at
Center. He has been in the
western part of the State twenty
eight years, and is a prominent
contractor and builder. He says
he could use a few good carpen
ters to advantage just now at
five dollars a day-eight hours
work.

Fsv. Drawbaush Leaves Altoona.
Rev. D. P. Drawbaugh, who
during the past sixteen years,
has been pastor of the Fourth
Lutheran church, Altoona, Pa.,
tendered his resignation to his
congregation on last Sunday
morning to become effective Au
gust 1st when he will accept a
call from Camden, Ind.
Rev. Drawbaugh came to Mc
Connellsburg soon after graduat
ing from Seminary, and served
as pastor of the McConnellsburg
Big Cove Tannery and Little
Cove churches for five years,
when he went to Altoona, and
has served in that pastorate ever
since. Rev. Drawbaugh is an
able minister and has been iden
tified with the Lutheran synodi
cal bodies in numerous responsi
ble offices.
(iocs to Long Island.
After having served the Luth
eran congregation in McConrells-
burg and at Big Cove Tannery
very acceptably for a period of
more than four year?, Rev. Rob
ert E. Peterman, announced last
Sunday that he had received a
call from the English Lutheran
church of St. Stephens, Hicks-
ville, Long Island. Believing
that a change in fields of labor
would prove advantageous to
both himself and the congrega
tions he had been serving, Mr.
Peterman asked that the pastoral
relations here be dissolved to take
effect September 1st, at which
time he expects to take charge of
his new work.
The announcement that Rev.
Peterman and his good wife were
about to leave McConnellsburg
was received with much regret
by their numerous friends. Bjth
Mr. and Mrs. Peterman have
been active in every movement
not only for the upbuilding of the
congregations in which they were
identified but that made for the
betterment of the town and com
munity.
Hicksvillo is situated about 25
miles from New York City, 13
miles from Oyster Bay, 5 miles
from the International Polo
Grounds, and 10 miles from Gar
den City. Hicksville is one of
the main railroad junctions of
Long Island. Hence, it will be
seen that the place is easy of ac
cess, is located right in the cen
ter of interesting territory, and
the Peterman parsonage at Hicks
ville will be a splendid place for
Fulton County people to spend a
summer vacation.

Rural Health America's First Duty.
Washington, D. C, July 14.
"The estimated economic loss
which our nation suffers each
year from typhoid fever and ma
laria alone aggregates 5928,234,
leaving out of entire account
the sorrow, the unhappiness, the
misery, and the inefficiency which
follow in their train." Senator
Joseph E. Ransdell of Louisiana
today addressed the Senate on
the subject of "Rural Health
America's First Duty." "The
greatest asset which our country
can have" said Senator Ransdell,
"i3 the healthy American citizen,
and valuable as it may be to in
crease the health of livestock and
vegetation, it is of far greater
importance that we throw every
possible safeguard about the
health of the man who is respon
sible for that livestock and vege
tation. Over 900 million dollars
lost every year. A sum which is
sufficient to put our country into
a state of preparedness equal to
that of any nation in the world,
enough money to give us the
largest navy afloat and the most
efficient army which the world
has ever seen, is annually offered
up as a sacrifice to two diseases
which are entirely preventable.
Enough money to pay the annual
expenses of every college student
in the United States, is ab.-iolute-fy
thrown away every year."
Senator Ransdell estimates thp
grand total loss from typhoid
fever at $271,032,880 per annum,
and the loss from malaria at
?Gl)l,904.750 per year; the total
ner capita loss from these twe
diseases being $9.46. By com
parative estimates it was shown
that the United States Govern
ment appropriated $5,010,175 for
the investigation and prevention
of - the diseases of animal and
plant life and only $1,917,506 for
the investigation and prevention
of the diseases of man.
The Eclipse.
Last Friday night, there was a
beautiful three-quarter eclipse of
the moon. Shortly after ten o'
clock the earth's shadow began
to creep over the moon, and by
half past eleven all but the lowei
portion was covered. The shad
ow seemed to stand at that posi
tion-for half an hour, durinp
which time a well defined ring
indicated the 'moon's outlines,
with the central portions shaded
to a peculiar tint. McConnells
burg was fortunate in having an
ideal sky only enojgh fleecy
clouds to add to the splendor of
the scene.

Good Shot
Mrs. W. M. Hann who resides
near Bethlehem church in Tod
township, is much interested in
poultry raising and was the pos
sessor of a fine flock of nice chick
ens. A family of weasels resid
ing in the same community be
came interested in Mrs. Hann's
chickens with the result that the
number of chickens was steadily
diminishing. Her husband, Mr.
W. M. Hann became interested,
and decided he would "clean up"
the weasel family with his trusty
rule. -He shot several times at
the maurauders. At first he
scared the weasels, but in time
they became used to it. Last
Saturday during Mr. Hann's ab
sence from home, Mrs. Hann
saw a big weasel trying to kill
one of her best hens, and she
got down the gun, pointed it in
the direction of the weasel, shut
both eyes, pulled the trigger and
bang! When she walked to the
place where the weasel and hen
were, the old hen was stretching
herself up and shaking out her
feathers, and the weasel was as
dead as a last year's bird nest,
Mrs. Hann having shot the ani
mal through the heart. A wea
sel's pelt is worth good money.
rree Sheep.
Two weeks ago, we told brief
ly the story of free sheep, the
animals to be given to farmers
oy an ansociation of businessmen
of the State in conjunction with
the State Agricultural Depart
ment. About five hundred farm
ers will be given ten pure bred
.theep each. For the farmer's
?are of the sheep he will receive
til the wool and half the lambs.
We have not heard of any move
to have part of the 5,000 sheep
corne to Fulton county. Other
counties are rushing in for their
ihare, why not have some here?
Have we positively no organiza
tion through which the Agricul
tural Department can act? Does
Fulton county propose to let every
ffer of something good slip away?
A'e know that a few men here
have labored for years to get the
farmers together in an effective
organization, but one of them
laid to us recently that he had
about despaired of ever accom
plishing anything..
The Aetna Powder Co., at Mt
Union, is making five million

Howard N. Hoke, Company B, Engineer
BatallioD, Writes from El Paso,
Texas, Under Date, July 7th.
The following taken from a
letter from Howard N. Hoke, a
son of Mr. and Mrs. Will E. Hoke,
former residents of Ayr town
ship, to his cousin Josephine Run
yan, will be read with interest by
Howard's Fulton County friends
and by others interested in the
boys down on the frontier. How
ard says:
"Well, we are here on the bor
der ready to cross the Rio Grande
into Mexico at a moment's no
tice. It looks now like Mexico
was going to back down, and we
will be called upon to clean up
the country for Carranza if we
go in at all. I want to go in to
fight; for, in my estimation we
will have the fighting to do soon
er or later, and 'why not now?'
It is an awful country down
here all sand as far as the eye
can see no vegetation except the
cactus, and a few other thorn
bearing plants. And, talk about
it's being hot! Howly Moses
About a hundred in the shade.
The only thing that saves at all,
is the cool breeze that finds its
way up from the Gulf, and the
fact that we are at an altitude of
1700 feet above sea level almost
as high as your Cove mountain.
Then, too, we have no humidity,
When we are exposed to the sun,
it seems just like we were stand
ing by a hot fire. It is necessary
for us to keep a wet cloth in our
hats. It is only when we are in
the shade that we get the cooling
effect of the air. At night it is
so cool that we are glad to sleep
under a blanket.
"I am with Company B, Engi
neers Battalion, N. G. U.S., and
we are very proud of ourselves,
as the War Department has giv
en us first place among the En
gineering Companies of the mil
itia. Pennsylvania has two com
panies of Engineers A, of Scran
ton; B, of Philadelphia. Our
company has 89 enlisted men,
ana ours wa3 tne only company
in Pennsylvania counting all
classes of the service that didn't
have a man turned down when
we passed the examination for
service.
"We spent five days and nights
in transit from Mt. Gretna to El
Paso, and we were a tired bunch
when we reached our destination.
There are now thousands of
troops encamped here. Separat
ing our camp from the Rio Grande
is a sand hill which protects us
from the fire of snipers on the
Mexican border. On the whole,
we are very comfortable. Of
course, there are a tew things
we have to depend upon our pa
triotic friends at home for. Army
rations may be all right from a
scientific standpoint, but when a
soldier sits down to his mess, he
misses a lot of appetizing things
he was accustomed to find on
mother's table. We are not al
lowed outside of camp to get any
extra 'eats', or tobacco, cigar
ettes, soap, stationery, tooth
powder, etc. some, or all, of
which articles, most soldier boys
need.
'Now, if there is any one in
dear old McConnellsburg that
wants to do something for any of
the 'boys' and will send it to me,
I will see that it gets to its prop
er destination. Lven a nennv
box of matches is a fortune down
here. Newspapers sell for five
cent3 a piece, and when it is con
sidered that we have - but fifty
cents a day as a wage income, it
behooves us to think twice before
we decide to be lavish in our
expenditures.
'In conclusion, permit me to
say that there is one thing that
always looks good to a boy in
camp; that is, a letter from any
of the home friends. My ad
dress is,
H. N. Hoke,
Company B, Eng. Batt. U. S. N.
G. Fort Bliss, El Paso, Texas."
