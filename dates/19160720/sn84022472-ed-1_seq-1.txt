FORMER HEALTH
BOARD MEMBER
AND NURSE CLASH
Dr. Blank, Escorting Chil
dren; Halted at, Station,
" ' Scores System Here.
The experience of Dr.- Elmer F.
Blank, a former health commission
er of this city, at the railroad sta
tion today, is related to demonstrate
the difficulties that attend the trav
elling public, and the. apparent lack
of organization among they staff of
the health department inspectors. '
Dr. Blank accompanied by Mrs.
Blank, and by Mrs. James E. Emmons
and the latters. two small children,
had just returned from Pittsfield,
coming into Bridgeport via South
Norwalk, and arriving at 11:58.
On alighting from the train. Dr.
Blank's party, who had been away
from the city for some days, was at
once halted by a police sergeant and
a health department nurse.
The doctor was informed that - the
children could not leave the train.
"But why?" asked the doctor.
' - "The health department won't allow
children to come into Bridgeport," re
plied the nurse.
"But these are Bridgeport children.
They live here; they've been out of
town for a lew days."
"It makes ho difference; they can't
come Into ' Bridgeport," replied , the
nurse.
Dr. ; Blank then explained who he
was; butthe police sergeant and nurse
replied that they knew him, but they
must obey their orders.
' It was more than 15 minutes before
the dispute was straightened out so
that the Emmons children were snow
ed to leave the station, after the doctor
asked the nurse when the new rules
went into effect, and what they were.
The nurse replied that the new rules
went into effect this morning, and
that .no children were allowed to enter
the city from New Tork or Boston.
Dr. Blank expressed his indignation
in no uncertain terms, at the apparent'
lack of information among the offi
cials, as to what rules are to be en
forced. .
"If these children were from New
Tork or Boston, then they may have
come within the provisions of the or
der of, the health department;- but
they are not from either city." ;
"I don t object to complying with
the rules of the health department;
the trouble is that the policemen and
the nurses don't know. It seems to
me that the health department, or
other city officials, ought to see that
they are properly informed as to
what their duti3 are, before they
subject travelers to such indignities
and inconvenience." .
"It'B an imposition to assign these
nurses to such an important position,"
asserted Dr. . Blank.. "They do not
know the cardinal symptoms of the
disease when there are hundreds of
physicians skilled in the diagnosis
and handling -of these cases who
would only too gladly give their own
time for, the benefit of the public and
to prevent any further increase of this
epidemic
"The services rendered by the
nurse this morning were absolutely
unnecessary, and could have been
given hy the policeman himself in a
more efficient manner."

water, practically covering ' all ap

Deutscland Is berthed." '
' Toward midnight the vigilance of
the German guards about the pier
tightened. Several launches were
found hovering about the waters near
the submarine and. while fhe Timmlns

FORECLOSURE ON
CROSSLEY GIVEN
TO THEWORDINS
Property in Litigation Al
ready Under Weight of
Many Attachments.
NO NEWS OF FORMER
REAL ESTATE BROKER
Suits Against Him Pending
in Both Superior and Com
- mon Pleas Courts.
Foreclosure proceedings against J.
Harry Crossley, the missing real estate
dealer, have been granted by Judge
Webb of the superior court who gives
Crossley until . the first Tuesday in
August to redeem the property, which
is located on Hancock avenue.
The action was brought by Helen
C. Wordin and Fannie I Wordin of
this city, who claimed Crossley owed
them $3,500. The money was loaned
January" 6, 19109 and Crossley gave
his note, secured by the Hancock ave
nue property. It is alleged that the
plaintiffs demanded payment on the
loan and when this was refused, they
brought legal proceedings. ,It was
found that the total amount due, in
cluding interest, was $3,856.25.
The property in '' question has a
frontage of 40 feet on Hancock ave
nue. It ' is already staggering under
the weight ef numerous other attachr
ments. Arthur Lieberum, the Bridge
port Brass Co. and R. N. Blakeslee
are among those who placed attach
ments on the property. They all filed
suits to recover money they claimed
Crossley owed them. The Wordin
forecloseure takes . precedence over
the other attachments, however.
It was said this morning by those
who have been keeping a watchful
eye open ,f or Crossley that the former
realty dealer has not visited this city
in a long time. Whether he is afraid
of -infantile paralysis or doesn't care
about meeting a sheriff with the pa
pers in his hand, is something of a
puzzle. But meanwhile there are a
number of suits against ' him still
pending in the superior- and common
pleas courts.
