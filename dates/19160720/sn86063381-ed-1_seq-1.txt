Home Folks Present at Convention
William Shaw, Christian En
deavor Leader, Talks.
By H. L. Rennick
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
St. Paul, Minn July 20.Hun-
dreds of the same kind of "home
town folks" who make up the church
boards, the Chautauqua crowds and
run the district schools in thousands
of towns and villages, swarmed to
St Paul today for the Prohibition na
tional convention.
Motherly old women of the type
that attend the homeland foreign mis
sionary society meetings back home
and bake cake and make jellies for
the pastor's aid society picnics were
in the crowd, so were bearded, gray
haired old men in their black "Sun
day go to meeting'* clothes. Some
of them with collars and some of them
who never wore one.
To Down Rum.
These delegates who came to St.
Paul imbued with the thought of
downing the Demon Rum are so dif
ferent from the crowds who attended
conventions of other political parties
as the frock-coated city merchant is
from the gnarly-fisted aproned store
keeper at Hicks Corners, or any other
cross road The Prohis seem more
earnest, and caring less for show.
The women brought their tatting,
their knitting and their patch work.
It was a hot day and coatless, col
larless, suspender-showing shirts
some of them blue and some of them
"boiled"dotted the crowd at the
auditorium.
Wears Diamond Stud.
For instance, there ^as Col. James
Ingersoll of Poontello, Idaho, a
grizzled, gray-mustached ranchman,
who sat on the platform. His boiled
shirt was collarless, he wore no coat,
but his diamond stud illuminated his
shirt as no necktie could. His gray
socks came down over the tops of his
square-toed black shoes, and he
twirled his mustache, appearing like
a gruff good scout, dressed up in his
Sunday clothes and dreading it. Col.
Ingersoll, the only Progressive leader
attending the convention, was in the
limelight continually.
Prohibitionist 63 Years.
Mrs. Kate M. Hamilton of Los An
geles, Cal., who is 74 years old and
has been a Prohibitionist for 63
years, was "grandmother" to many
of the women delegates who greeted
her. She sat near the platform dress
ed in prim white, with a bit of vanity
expressed in ear rings that bobbed
as she nodded her gray head.
This convention sings for amuse
ment, where other parties shouted,
marched and yelled. The Prohis
joined in the chorus when .A M.
Thatcher, who positively has the
deepest voice in captivity, rumbled
hymns and songs of the drys to the
accompaniment of a pianoplayed by
the same type of a girl who played the
organ back at the Hicks Corners
church.
The delegates seemed religious and
comfortable. There was no dressing
for stylebut a lot of "amens," de
voutly pronounced, when the minis
ters prayed or the hymns were sung.
Shaw Gives Address.
"When good men and great par
ties, for political expediency refuse
to commit themselves to a great cause
vital to the happiness and success of
the people, they should be set aside,"
declared William Shaw, prohibition
candidate for governor of Massa
chusetts in 1915, in* an address this
morning at the convention.

IN BRARETZ CASE
Frances A. Brabetz Gets Judgment
in Case Against Emory
Jarvis.
ASSERTED LIQUOR CAUSED
FATHER TO FREEZE FEET
Three Other Cases Still Pending
Nymore Barber Was in Hospital
for Long Time.
Frances A. Brabetz, the seven
year-old son of Albert Brabetz, who
was found lying in the snow near
his home Feb. 1 with his hands and
feet frozen, has been awarded a judg
ment of $5,000 in a suit brought by
his mother, Leora Brabetz, guardian
ad litem, against Emory Jarvis, Ny
more hotelkeeper, whom it was as
serted sold liquor to the senior Bra
betz.
Judge C. W. Stanton of the dis
trict court, awarded the judgment.
Carl Heffron was attorney for
Brabetz.
Formerly a Barber.
Albert Brabetz, who was formerly
a barber in Nymore, it is asserted
was intoxicated when he laid down in
the snow on the night of January 31
and became so badly frozen that parts
of his hands and feet had to be am
putated. It is alleged Jarvis hold
him "squirrel" whisky.
The action was brought under the
statute which holds that a man who
sells liquor is liable for damages that
may result to an intoxicated person
No Legal Saloons.
Brabetz is the father of two small
children.
There are no legal saloons in Ny
more, which is in the Indian "lid"
district.
There are still three other actions
in the present case pending against
Jarvis. These will probably be taken
up at the September term of court.
LINDBERG MAY YET FILE
FOR C0N6RESS IN "SIXTH"
Washington, July 20 Report here
has it that C. A. Lindbergh, recently
candidate for United States senator,
may file as an independent candidate
for congress in the Sixth district The
Republican nomination was recently
won by Harold Knutson.
It is considered there would be
nothing surprising in Mr. Lindbergh's
candidacy as an independent as his
connection with the Republican party
in the past has been tenuous.
