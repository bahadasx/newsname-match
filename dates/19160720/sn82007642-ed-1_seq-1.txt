Tbe safe arrival bL a German
submarine at an American port,
carrying a crew of twenty-nine
men and one thousand tons of
cargo, after coming thousands
of miles under the' seas, 'must
rank as one of the great achiev
ments of the century and as one
of the greatest trimphs of inven
tive genius. The submarine, which
carried a message from the kai
ser to President Wilson, left Ger
man waters June 23, so that it
consumed only two weeks in ma
king the strange voyage under
tbe Atlantic. The mind can hard
ly grasp the first blush
what such a feat means. Even
presuming that the submarine
rose occasionally to the surface
to get its bearings, it must
have gone hundreds of miles at
a time, Bteering and navigating
through tbe darkness of the
deep.
Cases where submarines have
Successfully ventured four or five
hundred miles from their bases
have been noted several times,
and some are reported to have
gone a thousand miles, but the
present journey of 4,000 miles
establishing a new record for
which other nations must strive.
It is only five or six years ago
that the submarine was in its ex
perimental stage, and naval ex
perts were inclined to scoff at the
idea that it would become a for
midable factor in maritime war
fare. But the world has seeu the
U-boat advance to new stages of
success, and what Germany has
accomplished with it in the pres
ent war is surely achievement
enough for a naval agency that
isjet in its infancy. Shut off
from the seas with every other
means of transportation by the
British blockade, the submarine
has become Germany's sole reli
ance, and if the remarkable feat
which one of her U boats has just
accomplished can be duplicated
on an extensive scale, the failure
of her merchant fleets to ply the
ocean may be compensated . in
some measure. Whether or not
the submarine is a successful op
erator in big naval battles has
yet to be determined, but we
doubt not that when the final
test does come, the underseas
boat will not be without its rec
ord of destruction achieved. The
history of the last two years has
shown very conclusively that
it can attack and inflict severe
damage on enemy ships without
even being seen, and as a des
troyer of merchant shipping it
has proven most effective. In
fact, the accomplishments of the
submarine, since it was brought
near perfection, have been such
as to warrant the belief of many
experts that the naval powers of
future generations must find in
it a tower of strength.
Meanwhile all the world will
justly applaud Germauy's mar
velous achievement) and all man
kind will pay well-earned tribute
- to that phenominal German en-
t terprise which was literally con
I queredthe terrors of the deep.

Alfalfa Growing it Wilkes.
The growth of alfalfa is still an
infant industry in the State of
Wilkes, but so profitable has
this industry proved to the few
who have engaged fn it that it
seems inevitable that more of
our farmers will soon follow the
example of those who have tried
it. Mr. D. E. Smoak, who was .a
mong tbe first to undertako the
culture of alfulfa, and who has a
thriving field of it now in its sec
ond year, is very enthusiastic
over its record so far and has
given us the following interest
ing figures:
The field comprises 11-2 acres.
He has already made two cut
tings this year and expects to
get three more during the sea
son.. The second cutting made
3,887 pounds of hay, which he
sold for $40.58. Allowing $5 00
for the coat of cutting, raking,
hauling, etc , wo find a clear prof
it of $41.58 per acre and a half
rora one cutting. Now suppose
that the five cuttings average so
much each (and the second cut
ting would naturally be about
the average) the total crop from
the 1 1-2. acres would represent
a profit of $207.90. This is a
profit of $138.60 per acre, which
represents the interest at G per
cent on $2,310.00.
Mr. Smoak has recently return-
ed from a trip to Watauga coun-
ty. He was much interested in the
sheep-raising industry of that
county. Dr. Little, of Boone, N.
C, who for some years has been
engaged in sheep raising, told
him something of the immense
profit and small labor of this in
dustry. Since he has counted tbe
profit from his little alfalfa fiield,
however, he feels inclined to chal
lenge, the sheep-raisers of Watau
ga. to -show a larger gain from
an equal investment. N o r t h
Wilkesboro Hustler,
Since Mr. Smoak, through the
Hustler, has put in tbe banter,
The Democrat comes to the bat
in favor of the sheep industry in
Watauga, and to clinch the con
tention, we give below the prof
its that accrued to one of our
farmers from a small flock of
sheep this season, and we are
sure that the reading public will
decide in favor of Watauga and
her sheep industry. Mr. Thomas
Greer, of Blowing Rock, R. F. D.,
from a flock of 19 ewes sold
lambs and wool to the amount
of $350.00, and still owns the
unbroken flock of 19 mother
sheep. Just what the ewes would
bring on the market,we have no
idea, but the money received for
the clip and .lambs would pay the
owner 6 per cent, interest on an
investment of $5,833. This is
only one instance, showing the
immense profit in sheep-raising
In Watauga. Wilkes is to be con'
gratulated on her alfalfa, but
she is taking in too much terri
tory when bIio throws down the
gauntlet to the sheep-raisers of
the mountains. Democrat.

The Final Word.
Washington Tost. ,
Greater shells, larger Zeppelins,
monstersupersubmarinesaslong
as a city block, concentrated
gunfire that obliterates the tren
ches and buries the Boldiers alive
each and all of these are being
announced as "the last word in
scientific warfare."
Perhaps the judgement is cor
rect. So much in the way of so
called improved has already been
about, however, that it is feared
the critics fall short of tbe true
optimistic heights, At present a
torpedo occasionally misses,
thereby indicating that tbe ex
treme pointof destructive efficien
cy is yet to be reached. Surely,
the one invented by a young
American that can be controlled
by wireless throughout a journey
of indefinite length, that can be
deflected to right or left or even
be made to turn around and
come back, will mark a still fur
ther stride foreward.
Doubtless 6ucb things must be.
The thought that enlarged pow-
ers of destructiveness would end
war has been largely discarded
from men's minds, in view of the
history of the present European
struggle. These have not even
made the contest more brief. Un
der changed conditions the ''wear
ingdown" process appears the
sole resource, once the brisk off
ensive fails.
But there are other last words
of more cheering import. We

of a radium screen bv a Pitts
burgh inventor, through, the use
of which he hopes to make the
blind see.
In the announcement of the
'final word," the whole world,
belligerents as well as neutrals
can join in the hope that the
dreams of the Pittsburgh inven
tor will have its place.
Progressives to Gather in Chicago.
New York Dispatch July 12.
A conference of representative
Progressives from all parts of
the country soon will be held in
Chicago, it was announced here
today by Bainbridge Colby to
consider "the widespread and bit
ter revolt within the country"
against the action of the nation
al committee in endorsing Char
les E. Hughes, the Republican
nominee for the presidency. The
date will be decided upon in a few
days. Mr. Colby said the confer
ence would be national in scope,
although all States might not be
represented.
Mr. Colby, who placed Theo
dore Roosevelt in nomination at
the national Progressive conven
tion at Chicago, said he had let
ters from every quarter of the
country protesting against what
he characterized as "the Perkins-
Flinn program." This program,
he added, "does not represent the
thought or feeling of the rank
and file of the party."
Mr. Colby made public a tetter
he had received from John M.
Parker of Louisiana, the Pro
gressive nominee lor vice presi
dent, in which Mr. Tarker refer
red to the "star chamber" pro
ceedings of the national commit
tee, adding:
"An enormous number of vo
ters will never submit to such
treatment and I believe that un
less we consider the millions of
wage earners who were deeply in
terested in and believed in there-
forms and betterment for tbe
people, which we have steadfastly
stood for, wewillsostn
public sentiment that we mar
see an overwhelming wave of pro
test, threatening anything per
taming to an inuepenaeut move
for the next generation.
"I am confidents could bavi
an immediate and representatw
gathering meet in Chicago and 1
earnestly appeal to the Progres
sives all over tbe country to send
delegates.

life at the Cowles home. ' Clover
Hill," in Yadkin Valley yester

lifeless body lying on the floor of
his room. An open razor was by
his Bide, two gashes in his neck,
a shot gun lying across his body
and the entire top of his head
blown off.
Sheriff Triplett and Coroner
Austin were immediately called
to the scene, but it was a clear
case or suicide ana no inquest
was held, A note in hand wring of
deceased was left in the room
reading as follows: "Joe, I can't
stand it any longer. I'm going
to commit suicide. Calvin." He
gave no reason for his rash act.
The evidence showed that de
ceased tried to end his life with a
razor, but was unsuccessful. A
shot gun was then used and the
whole load emptied into his fore
heal.

afternoon at fourjo 'clock in the
cemetery at Chapel Of Rest. De
ceased was abou t 40 years of age
and was uover married. He was

A Fointr Watauga Lady Writes.
Editor Democrat: I received a
copy of your paper recently and
enjoyed it so much that I am
sending herewith my subscrip
tion for one year. Having been
away from natauga now. past
ten years, we. still love to hear
all the good news and prosper
ous woik of our native State.
We think Washington is a fine
farming state. We are located on
a farm near Colfax, a very thri-
ving town of about thirty-five
hundred population. It has sev
eral churches of various denomi
nations; good schools and is sur
rounded by a good farming coun
try, which makes it prosperous.
We had a very late spring here,
although crops are looking fine,
and prospects for a good harvest
were never better. Mr. Sherwood
has about five hundred .acres of
wheat and oats to harvest We
like farming, and think this an
ideal place to rear our boys. We
now have with us several North
Carolina boys, two of whom,
James Sherwood and Jack Bing
ham, of Cove Creek, came out
last spring.
I shall now look forward to
thecomingof your taj-treacli
week with much pleasure. With
best wishes to your paper and
my many friends in Watauga, 1
am,
Respectfully,
Mrs. C. S. SiiEnwooo.
