VIOLENT STORM IN
TOWN UNO COUNT'
THE GREATEST EVER KNOV
HERE-WIND AND RAIN TAKI
VERY HEAVY TOLL.
The most destructive storm th
has visited this State in many yes
struck Kingstree and vicinity in t
form of a hurricane early Frid
morning, uprooting trees or tearii
them to pieces limb by limb, a
breaking plate glass windows, tei
inor awnings into threads and c
y - i
stroying signs until every street
the town was strewn with deb
and the force of the wind and rs
made it almost impossible for stroi
men to venture out.
Practically all places of busim
remained closed during the dayexce
the drug stores. Telephoae a
electric light wires were down
many places as a result of f&lli
trees or branches and the town w
in darkness Friday night.

Friday's hurricane was iouow
by a tremendous pour of rain whi
kept up almost without cessati
from S o'clock p. ra. Thursday un
T a. m. Sunday, during which tii
y nearly seventeen inches of rainf
was recorded by the Governme
guage here, or to be exact, 16.
inches. During the wind and n
storm of Thursday night until 7
m. Friday only 3.45 inches were
corded, while from Friday morni
until 7 o'clock Saturday morni
1240 indies had fallen. From S
urday's reading until Sunday mo
' ing the fall was only 0.72, maki
the above total of 16.77 inches of ra
^ail.
The flood which followed t
downpour surpassed anything of
kind in the recollection of our old
dtraens. Black river rose to a heif
of 15^ feet above normal, or 3} ft
above flood stage. The river's hi;

when it rose to a height of 12.5

and the bridge several miles be- a

tjn The overflowing of the drainage
canal that runs through town crossing
Main street between the Williamsburg
Live Stock Co's place and ^
?ss Vause's shop occurred before midQ

that the buildings occupied by Rod- 11

out of bed into water up to his
knees. The Messrs Jacobs were on ?

The last train to pass through
[ingstree was No 89 Friday night,
rom which time no mail was reeived
here until 10:30 p.m.Monday,
?hen a local train was run here
rom Florence.
RAILROADS BADLY DAMAGED.
The great volume of rushing waer
that had transformed the little
rainage canal into a raging river
nd extended over its banks to the
igh land on the east and the roadied
of the ACL track on the west
oade its way to the edge of the
wamp, carrying every movable obect
in its path. At the swamp trees
iftd blown down,, a great quantty
of lumber and debris collected
,nd formed a sort of a dam.turning a
arge body of water against the roadted
with insufficient outlet. By midlight
Friday the water had covered
he track from a point south of the
- ? ' ?- -1 1
tation ana naa carried away several
lundred yards of roadbed to a depth
if 15 feet in some places, leaving
he track suspended in the water.
There were only two serious washmts
between the depot and the
iridge across Black river, but beyond
hat point and Lanes there were sevral
bad places. Sunday morning a
rork train with a large force of
lands and a pile driving machine got
n the job and worked night and
lay until the track was put in order
or temporary use, the first train
rom the south passing over the
washouts Tuesday morning.
The work of getting the tracK m
ondition at this place for the passge
of trains looked as if it would
e a hard and tedious undertaking
0 the average person, but when W
1 McCullough, general roadmaster,
ot on the job with his big force
he track was rapidly replaced, the
hasms bridged and ready for trains
a less than 36 hours.
Between Kingstree and Florence
luch damage was done the A C L
racks, and Mr McCullough inform-,
d us that the company was sufferag
the greatest damage it had exerienced
in 30 years.
AMAGE TO CROPS AND LIVESTOCK.
It is a question as to which of the
lements has caused the greatest
amage to crops?wind or water.

rokenoff. Tobacco was whipped and
ruised by the wind until it is in bad
sndition, to say the least. Some
elds, of course, are in a worse conition
than others, and the extent of
he damage depends largely upon
he handling and curing of the disbled
crop. The crop is badly damged;
just how badly no one knows.
Cotton is thought by some to be
jriously damaged while there are
there who believe that with proper
ultivation it may yet come out and
lake a fairly good yield. True, it
as been severely whipped, bruised
nd wrent by the wind, but it is still
oung, and if the land drains sufciently
and rapidly enough for
arly cultivation it may not be so
eriously injured in the end.
A large number of hogs and catle
have doubtless perished in the
wamps by the rapid rise of water,
t is impossible just now to estimate
he number, but it is safe to say
hat the loss is heavy. Hundreds of
hickens have also been drowned.
Gardens, at least in Kingstree, are
one. Tomatoes look as if they had
een scalded with hot water, while
pole and lima beans have much the
same appearance. Peas seem to
have stood the onslaught of wind
and rain better than any other vegetation.

THE STORM AT FLORENCE '
Florence, July 14:?The tropical
storm which so suddenly swept in on
the Southeast Atlantic coast early
last evening struck this section shortly
before midnight last night and
grew in intensity as the night passed
until today it is sweeping the
Pee Dee section with hurricane proportions.
The wind was accompanied
by torrential rains that did heavy
damage to business houses and residences.
The water was driven
through the roofs and sides of the
buildings and through every crevice,
so that hundreds of buildings are
soaked with water.
The streets of Florence are a mass
of uprooted and broken trees and
broken telegraph, electric and telephone
wires and cables and many
buildings are damaged from wind.
So far no person has been reported
as being injured but the streets
and roads are almost impassable
from fallen trees and limbs, while
many bridges .have been washed
away. The storm at 4 o'clock this
afternoon had not abated in force
or in rainfall with little prospect for

The tropical storm reached Dillon
last night and the rain and wind have
lasted all day with unabated fury.
Much damage to tobacco and corn
crops is feared.

be but details common to this entire
country, and would not be news to
the readers of The Record. It was,
however, unquestionably the worst
storm ever witnessed by any living
person here. The wind was somewhat
higher than in August, 1893,
while the rainfall far exceeded anything
ever before known here. Unofficial
estimates, based upon the
height of buckets,tubs,lard cans and
garbage cans that were in the open,
range from twelve to twenty-six

sure of this, that no such amount of
water was ever upon the ground as
was here Saturday morning. It was
over the Coast Line tracks all along
the station and almost to Main street.
In Acline avenue in front of the
Rowell store it was five feet deep.
In the yard of Major S M Askins,
which is within twenty feet of the
exact center of the town, the water
was about 16 inches. Some boys
navigated a raft from the Coast Line
station to beyond J A Green's residence
on Thomas street. Several
stores were flooded to the depth of
as much as 20 inches in some cases,
and goods were damaged. FlowersNesmith
Co and Joseph Khetter
were the worst sufferers along that
line. Hundreds of chickens were
drowned all over the town and country.
Hayden McKenzie had some
hogs in a pen near Thomas street.
The water rose so high that the hogs
swam out over the top of the pen.
These things are mentioned to give
an idea of just how much water we
had.
The trestle across Lynch's lake
was undermined badly and the abutments
washed out for several feet.
The first train went over it Monday
night. Every road bridge across this

in reaching Lynchburg, where a

Friday, were obtained,

The proportion of loss is estimated
all the way from 25 to 75 per

the estimates are rising each day.
The significance in this is that the
extent of the damage is more and
more clearly reyealed each day. Today

GREAT DAMAGE
IN GEORGETOWN.
THE CITY ON THE SAMP1T HARD
HIT BY THE RECENT FURIOUS
WIND AND RAIN STORM.
For several days no word was
heard here from Georgetown, and
the general belief was that the town
had suffered great damage. All
communication with the outside
world was cut off from Friday until
a report was given out by Capt J H
Porter,of the Atlantic Coast Lumber
Co's tug.on which he earried a party
to Conway. Capt Porter said:
During the storm the wharves and
stores on the water front were flooded
with water several feet deep, and
the Seaboard Air Line railway's
tracks were washed away around
Georgetown for three or four miles.
The damage to the Atlantic Coast
Lumber company's plant is estimated
at $50,000. The whole town presented
a mass of wires and upturned
trees and wrecked buildings. A
number of tugs and craft were sunk,
among them being the Palmetto
yacht owned by E W Kaminski and
a number of gasoline launches owned
by J E McQuad, of the Georgetown
Canning factory. As many
more craft were washed ashore.
The Winyah Lumber company's
plant was practically a total loss.
The smoke stacks of all the mills
were blown away by the high wind.
The power house was almost a total
wreck and wires were blown helterskelter
about the streets and wound
about the trees. It will be many
days before it can be repaired. The
Scurry garage was demolished by a
large tree falling on the building.
The high school building was unroofed
and considerable damage
wrought inside by the beating rains
and terrific wind.
The crops in the county must be
practically a total loss, judging from
the gardens in the town. They were
literally torn to shreds and leveled
to the ground. The buildings on the
island did not suffer correspondingly
as those in town. No lives were lost.
least harmed. Conservative approximations
place corn at 50 per cent,
tobacco, 50 to 60 per cent, cotton, 25
to 35 per cent. All this may prove
wrong,either up or down. As things
appear today, this section is face to
face with the most dismal future
that ever confronted it. Following
on the heels of 1914 and 1915, this t .
third and greatest calamity is well
nigh stunning.
