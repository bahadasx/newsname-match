Political Gossip from
Washington.
Washington. July 19. (Spec
ia
Correspondence.) "The Repub
licans in Wisconsin are active
earnest and united for the com
ing campaign," said Representa
tive William J. Cary of that state
"I would not be at all surprised
to see our state tro 100,000 for
Hughes and Fairbanks. The on
ly question at issue is the size o:
the Republican mpjority."

"N'o more ludicrous thing has
ever been done by this adminis
tration than to flop on the tariff
proposition," said a middlewest
memhpr of Conerress. "Where a
fw months ago the President
was poking fun at the idea of a
tariff commission he is now fall
ing all over himself in favor of
one. From all reports it is to be
a typical Wilson commission and
will be headed by a political eco
nomist and well known advocate
of free trade, who is connected
with one of the big colleges of
the country. It seems to me
that the people have had enough
theory injected into this admin

through the instrumentality of a
tariff commission.. A real tariff

National Committeeman Virgil
L. Hyland of West Virginia was
conversing with some Republican
friends at the capitol a few days
since. Speaking of the West Vir
ginia situation he said: "It is all
over but the shcuting in our state.
There is nothing left to do but
count the votes and figure up the.
size of the Republican majority.
West Virginia is as sure to go Re
publican this fall as any human
event can be. The Republicans
and Progressives are once more
united and they are working in
harmony. What happened a few
weeks ago in one of oucongres
sional districts shows which way
the political wind, is blowing in
West Virginia."

Already many Democrats are
beginning to concede that there
is little or no liklihood of their
carrying the House at the com
ing election. Not only is this
talked among the members, but
it is also the theme of conversa
tion among many of the present
employes of the capitoL Some
of them are already beginning to
make arrangements for employ
ment in other circles and there
has not been such a pronounced
indication of "moving day" in
the old historic building in many
a year.
, "The western states will line
up for the 'Republican ticket"
said Representative Clifton N.
Mc Arthur of the Portland, .Ore.
con, district. - "There has been
some gossip that the western Pro.
gressives would not follow Col
: Roosevelt, but this talk hag been
made by Democrats. There is
ground for this, for all along the
line, those states over on the Pa
cific slope are red hot for the Re
publican ticket and the old fash'
ioned Republican majorities can
be looked for in November."

Representative Cyrus A. Sullo-
way of New Hampshire, speak
ing to a group of nis colleagues,
said : ' 'I have just been over my
district Everybody ia enthusi
astic for Hughes. Not only will
he receive the support of prac
tically all of the Progressives of
my state, but many Democrats,
disgruntled with the present ad
ministration, will also give the
Republican candidate its support.
Among the rank and fiU of the
former Progressives, I do not
know of one that is not back with
our party. The best of it all is
that they are enthusiastic 'for the
ticket."

Crop Conditions.
Wheat prospects show no ma
terial difference trom that repor
ted one month ago. The state
average is now estimated at 69
per cent or about 10.3 bushel per
acre. Harvest will be late owing
to unfavorable weather condi
tions. Damage by joint worm
2.5 per cent..
Oats show an improvement
during the past month, the har
vest prospect being estimated at
86 tot cent based upon 30 bush
els per acre representing 100 per
cent.
Heavy and continuous rains
throughout the state delayed
corn planting tar beyond the per
iod when usually all the corn is
in. and a great many fields pre
pared for corn have not been
planted. This has had some con
siderable effect on the total area
as indicated by the estimate made
of area which is 260,635 acres
short compared with last year
Corn is generally small for this
t;me of year, and there is great
ack of uniformity of growth ow
ing to the irregularity in time of
planting; yet this is a crop which
pushes rapidly forward under fa
vorable conditions, and with such
from this period, there will be
time for the making of a good
crop on the area that is up. The
comparative condition for, the
Irtffis-cstimttatTS per -cent
of an average. Damage is re
ported by the cut worm to the
extent of 3.5 per cent and by
white grub worm 2 5 per cent.
The area of potatoes has been
estimated at 89 per cent compar
ed with an average, which is a
shortage of 10,551 acres. Plant
ing was late and farmers have
been unable to cultivate owing to
the heavy rains. The condition,
however, is estimated at 89 per
cent of an ayerage.
Timothy generally good, tho'
some is thin, and many fields are
overrun with white tops. Pas
tures are generally excellent, .
Horses and cattle are in good
condition and the number of colts
and calves compare well with past
few years. ,

Pi of. Bowles, president of the

at McKinney, Ky addressed a
large attendance f our people
last night at our Presbyterian

A large delegation of our Ma
sonic fraternity,-attended the
lodge doines at Versailles last
Thursday night, when the lodge
of that place raised five Fellow
Crafts to the tublime degree of
Master Mason, and also had a
banquet during the time. Our
boys report havirg had a good
social time with the meet of lodges
and delegations from other lodges
within the county, all of whom
assisted in making it a worth
while occasion. Our boys got
home about midnight...
C. J. Miller and family and
Miss Lizzie Moul of Pleasant Hill,
I. M. Petersime and family, Ed
Swinger and family, W. H. Cook
and family and Dor3e Kindell,
wife and boy, had an outing at
Orchard Island', near Belief on

Thursday to yesterday. They
report having had a fine time
and a festive occasion devouring
an excellent supply of fi&h- taken

Ray Gilbert, having completed

ment from the 0. S. U. of Col
umbus, is opening a veterinary
office in this place. This adds
one more business to the many
ventures abounding here. We
wish him abundant success in his
calling and think, without doubt,
lie will inake good.
Criminal court was in session
here last Friday in which a stone
flinger was given a lesson in the

ul enough in his next encounter
to miss the object of his wrath.
Our ticket agent sold thirty ex
cursion tickets to Columbus yes-

- Another grain market seems in
prospect for this place, which, if
it materializes, will furnish an
opportunity to grains sellers to
have some choice to whom to sell.
There stems to be a large num
ber of persons just now willing
to sacrifice themselves on the al
tar of efficient service to the pub
lic. This, of course furnishes
abundant material :tfrem which
the people may choose their ser
vants to administer the govern
ment. B. M. Allen was here to
urge his claim for State Senator,
and, without doubt, made a fav
orable impression. Mr. Allen is
a fanner and is, we. think, all
right.

In I Olio thes,e nine Ohio cities had
a total of S.UUO saloons. Ten years
later, in 131G, these same cities, with
tens of thousands added to their pop
ulation, had a total of 3.703 6aloons, a
decrease of more than half. Here are

While these figures tell the story of
the decline in saloons in the cities of
Ohio, they do not tell it all, for while,
the number of saloons lias been raore
than cut In two In aU the counties ia ',
hich ,ihese..,welJ,,cities..Ara .located. '
there are not now as many saloons ia
operation as the law permits. In ti i
capital city of Columbus, which has
only half as many saloons as ten
years ago, there are about half a hun
dred liquor licenses not working. 1
The decrease as shown by the cen
sus figures of 1U5 and 1915 is not
confined to Ohio cities by any means.
The slump is general all over the
country. The booze Joints are drying
up. The traffic is withering away.
Only the other day announcement was
made of the closing down the past
year of 600 saloons in Greater Newi
York.
In 129 Okies of the country having
saloons in both 1903 and 1915 the de- j
crease in the number of dealers sell
ing by the drink was 10,023. Some of
the cities show a decrease of less ,
than 10 per cent in tiie ten years. '
They are New York, Chicago, St.
Lc!s, Detroit and Milwaukee. These .
cities had big inortases in population',
and industries of all kinds except tie j
booze joints. There have been so
many saloons closed in these great
cities during: the past year that it is '
reasonable to believe that a comparl- j
son of the years 1905 and 1916 would !
show a decrease of more than 10 per
cent in all these places. n
In the 10 year period from 1905 to
1915 the number of saloons in San;
Francisco slumped from 3,280 to 2,074. j
In Washington, D. C, the decrease j
was from f36 to 300, and in Baltimore)
from 2,279 to 1.203. 1
All of which would indicate that the
Philadelphia brewer was right when,
in an interview with newspapers of !
that city a few days ago, he said he .
was getting out of the business be
cause the bottom Is dropping out of i
the liquor traffic.
