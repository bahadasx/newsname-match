J It Illacknby was culled to Cald
well lant week to gn over the road
from that point to Homedale and on
to the Succor creek, where the Ni
trate beds are located
The Idea Is to make It a public
highway from Caldwell to the Ore
gon state llnp and for the Malheur
people to care for It from the xtate
line south
Ihe nitrate people have built nev
erul mllen of road from Homednln
toward their mines and feel thut the
county should help out some, I at I
lullv an the road will be the main
travelled road to the southern part
of the county and will nave the Pol
xon creek hill and several miles of
gumbo, bexlden xhortenlng the dln
tance from Vole to the southern sec
tion of the county by about fifteen
miles
The nitrate people are building up
Succor creek on the west side and
thus will have no difficult grades or
hud places The roud leaves the creek
bottom at the rocky ford and from
that point there Is now a good road
and one that can be travelled at all
xcasonn of Hie year.
M the count) officials ordering
few in I lex of road fixed up from Hi
Owyhee bridge through Kingman col
ony and up the Snake river a few
in i lex connection can be made with
J thla highway at small expense.
The people of the southern part of
thla county are entitled to a road to
the county seat and thla will give It
to them The Watxon aectlon would
no doubt use thin road when fixed as
I It would be their best way out.
