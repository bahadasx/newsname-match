Commissioners
A hard fought session of the
General Council of Minnesota
Chippewas took place last week
at Bemidji.
The session began after the
council was caUed to order by
the president. A contesting dele
gation from Pine Point that was
brought to Bemidji by Mr. Ny
gren, principal of the Pine Point
Indian School, then tried to be
seated.
The credentials committee final
ly referred the contest to the
White Earth delegations present,
the regular and contesting delega
tions, te settle among themseb't^.
These delegations retired to the
council room where a motion was
made to seat all the regularly
elected delegates and if there were
any vacancies the contesting dele
gation would be allowed to take
these. The motion was passed un
animously, but in his reading of
the report of the credentials com
mittee, Henry Warren, chairman
of the committee, left out the
names of Paul H. Beaulieu, Jr.,
Joseph Bellanger and Henry Mar
tin, of the regular delegation and
who were present and had been
nominated at the meeting between
the regular and contesting dele
gations, and this gave the contest
ing delegation three more seats.
There were also present in the
council a number of persons who
held the proxies of some regularly
elected delegates, but they oppos
ed the seating of the regularly el
ected delegates. They were Eu
gene Warren, Frank Beaulieu,
John B. Warren, and were aided
in their opposition by Henry War
ren and George Berry, who were
elected with the regular delega
tion here at the earnest solicita
tion of B. L. Fairbanks and the
publisher of THE TOMAHAWK.
The most glaring discrimination
was in the seating of Joseph Mor
rison as a White Earth delegate al
though he was not elected with
the regular delegation, the con
testing delegation, or at the meet
ing between the regular and con
testing delegations at Bemidji to
settle the contest.
The grounds upon which the ad
gates to the annual meetings of the
General Council on the second
Tuesday in June. This provision
was not complied with upon any of
the reservations, but the right of
the White Earth delegation to be
seated was the only one attacked
by some delegates from here who
were able to get on the delegation
only by soliciting and obtaining
proxies.
Nygren Takes A Active Interest.
One of the most noticeable feat
ures of the appearance of a con
testing delegation from Pine Point
was the activity of Mr. Nygren,
principal of the Pine Point school,
in the matter. It was to him that
the interested persons from this
place telephoned to have a number
of the warehousers from Pine
Point sent to the Bemidji Council
as a contesting delegation.
There was not even the preten
tion of a council meeting held to
elect the delegates but Frank Smith,
according to his statements, was
notified by Mr. Nygren to proceed
to Bemidji, and money was fur
nished to him and the other so-call
ed contesting delegates to pay ex
penses.
It is not believed that the In
dian office was a party to Mr.
Nygren's actions, and it should be
brought to the attention of not
only the office but also to the In
dian committees of Congress.
The recognized chiefs of the
tribe are entitled to participate at
the meetings of the General Coun
cil, and the president of the Coun
cil recognized Ah-bow-ay-geshig
and young Peake as chiefs al
though neither of them by inheri
tance or otherwise are recognized
as chiefs by the Chippewas of this
reservation. But this had the ef
fect of increasing the number of
contestants, and as there was no
great issue at stake no particular
objections were made by the reg
ular delegates.
A Testef Strength.
There was apparently no contest
between the Furstetal. forces and
its opponents until the report of
the Chippewa Claims Commission
was read and a motion was made
to adopt it. An amendment to
the motion was then made to re
organize the Chippewa Claims com
mission by displacing the present
commissioners, who were all mem
bers of this reservation, and ap
pointing a representative from
each of the other Chippewa reser
vations in this state, including this
reservation. In this connection
the president of the council made
a ruling from which the anti-Furst
et al. forces appealed to the coun
cil, and it overwhelmingly over
ruled him. He immediately re
signed from the claims com
mission. The president's resigna
tion was followed by that of Frank
Beaulieu and George Berry, who
were also members of the com
mission.
Efforts were then made by the
anti Furst forces to get a vote on
the motion but the president would
not bring the question to an issue,
but adjourned the council although
there would have been ample time
to take the vote.
At the evening session when the
Furst forces saw there were com
paratively only a few of the oppo
sition present, they tried to force
the question to a vote but in this
they failed. At twelve oclock

morning session. It was"also evi
dent that the Furst forces did not
regard the council proceedings of
this or last year regular, a* Henry
Warren so stated when the Furst
forces were defeated although Jim
Coffey, another active member of
the force, took an opposite view.
But afterwards a vote was taken
which, according to the tellers
whom the president selected from
the Furst forces, resulted in forty
eight for the Furst forces a,nd forty
six for the opposition. The correct
ness of this count was challenged,
but the president refused to test
it by having another vote taken.
Four persons who kept a tally of
the vote pronounced the count
taken by the tellers as being incor
rect.
There was 3ucb a gross violation
of fairness that it became apparent
to the opponents of the Furst forces
that the issue would have to be
fought out next year.
As the matter now stands with
regurd to the effort of the anti
Furst forces to have the Chippewa
Claims Commission reorganized so
that one member from each reser
vation should be selected, B. L.
Fairbanks, Win. Potter, Neshe-
kay-we-gah-bow, John G. Morri
son, Henry Warren and Eugene
Warren are still members of the
commission. John G.- Morrison
was re-elected president of the
council and he was thus restoied
as a commissioner, regardless of
his prior resignation, but George
Berry and Frank Beaulieu having
resigned, they ceased to be mem
bers of the commission.
Duties of the Cmmission.
The object of the resolution cre
ating a commission was for the
purpose of first having the mem
bers thereof investigate the claims
of the phippewas agaitisj the Uni
ted States, ana1
then' take steps
to secure the passage by congress
of an act referring these claims to
the Court of Claims. This has not
been done except that John G.
Morrison stated at the council that
he had obtained ten abstracts re
garding homesteads or land that
had been disposed of by the govern
ment which formerly comprised
Red Lake Chippewa reservation
lands, but he failed to state
whether these lands were Chi ppewa
of Minnesota or Red Lake Chip
pewa lands.
$15,000,000 Involved,
Approximately fifteen million
dollars are involved in the issue be
tween the anti-Furst and the Furst
forces, and the former are opposed
to placing in the hands of an at
torney who has had no experience
in the prosecution of Indian claims,
and whose principal practice, it is
alleged, has been the collection of
bad individual debt.*.
As evidence of the lack of knov
ledge or ability regarding Indian
claims, the Furst forces are ap
parently not familiar with the laws
governing Indian claims, for the
council created a commission and
provided for its work, but it could
not be assumed that the men now
on the commission would remain
there indefinitely but that in the
course of the meetings of the
General Council changes would
necessarily take place in the per
sonnel of the commission. It can
therefore readily be seen that the
commissioners appointed at the
General Council of last year ex
ceeded their authority by employ
ing Furst and others without the
consent of the Council. The reso
ulation creating a commission ex
pressly provides that certain work
shall be done by the commission
for the Chippewas of, Minnesota
under a contract the compensation
of which shall be ten per cent of
the amount recovered, but no au
thority is given the commission to
employ attorneys without the con
sent of the tribe. Neither can the
contract be assigned without the
consent of the Secretary of the
Interior and Commissioner of Indi
an Affairs.
The resolution creating a com
mission was drawn and offered in
the council last year by the pub
lisher of THE TOMAHAWK, and being
familiar with the U. S. laws appli
cable to contracts he drew it in a
manner which would require a
strict compliance with the law re
ferred to.
Two of the commissioners, name
ly B. L. Fairbanks and Wm.
Potter refused to sign the contract
because they did not have confi
dence in it, especially as Henry
Warren, one of the commissioners,
wa a government employe when
he was elected and the law pro
hibits an employe of the govern
ment from aiding, sanctioning or
advising in the making of Indian
contracts. Furthermore, another
U. S. a prohibits any employe
from aiding in the prosecution of
suits against the United States un
til he has been out of the service
at least two years.
A violation of either of these
two laws lays the violator subject
to a heavy fine and imprisonment.
The important interest of the
Chippewas of Minnesota are too
great to proceed indifferently to
wards prosecuting them, and U. S.
laws should be complied with in
every respect regarding the con
tracts. The intent should not be for
the purpose ef furnishing employ
ment to incompetents in this part
icular work with a job, but for the
uurpose of securing some favorable

The publisher whose resolution
created the commission bad only
one object in view when he intro
duced it and this was to have no
such delay in Chippewa of
Minnesota claims as he has hai
in the Mille Lac case. He agreed
to assist in the work of ihe com
mission but positively refused
become one of the commissioners,
lie also refused to become a-soei
atedwith Mr. Furst because of the
latter's utter lack of experience in
Indian matters and knowledge ot
Indian laws. He has no motive such
as employing the two attorneys
Henry Warren charged in the coun
cil he represented, for he has no
choice except to get attorneys of
experience in the work, so that the
interests of the Indians will bo
protected.
So far as Mr. Warren's state
ments at the council are concerned
his retraction regarding the attor
neys, the publisher he alleged
favored, should be sufficient to sat
isfy the council.

Council held here at this placed
commencing on June 12ih. 1915,
resolution was passed which pro-f
vided for the creation of a Chip-!
pewa Claim*. Commission. Theob^
ject of this commission, as wa:
plainly stated when I he resolution
wm, introduced, was to have it in-1
vestigate the claims of the Chip
pewas of Minnesota against th
United States, and to have a juris
dictional act submitted to Con
gress within a year after a con-j
tract was made with the members
of the commission.
Instead of doing the work for
which they were selected, two ofj
the commissioners immediately1
proceeded to Minneapolis and made
a contract with two attorneys,
Furst and Koe, to prosecute the!
Chippewa claims, but two of the!
members of the commission have
refused to sign the contract up to
this time, on the grounds that the*
intent of the resolution creatingI
the commission has not been fuj-f
tilled, and furthermore, that the*
whole proceeding has been ir-|
regular.
At the Bemidji General Council!
last week it was contended by one!
of the members of the commission
that all the meetings of the General
Council up to the last meeting}
were and had been irregular.
If the technical question that
was raised against the sealing of
the regularly elected delegates to
the recent Bemidji Council from
this reservation had any foundation
the council which created the^
Chippewa Commission was like*
wise irregular, and for this reason
