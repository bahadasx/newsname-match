IT MEANS
ANOTHER
HAY CROP
Buyer Says Heavy Rain Will Mean An
other Cutting of Alfalfa in Washita
Valley This Season
"The hay crop had all been about i
gathered and shipped for the season," !
I said J. M. Peters, hay buyer, this
J morning to an Express man. "Anoth
er crop looked very doubtful and this
w,ould have been the last week of ship
ments. But, as a result at this heavy
downpour I expect to get at least seventy-five
more carloads this' year. The
ten cars which I shipped out last week
and about fifteen which I expected to
get this week I believed would wind
tip my work in alfalfa."
"This has been a prosperous year
for raisers of hay. While the price
has not been so good as in other years,
they have had a fine growth nd have
had a splendid chance to save it all.
Frow now on they will have more fa
vorable weather in which to mature
it than at any other time of the year.
There will be at least one more cut
ting all around and in some cases,
where another cutting was about
ready; there will be two. As every cur
means on an average of $100 coming
Into this section the revenue from hay
this year will not be inconsiderable."

5 QUARTS
"A Flyless Town" is the Ambition of
City Physician Dawson and He
Wants to Make It One
"A flyless town," is the slogan which
has been adopted by Dr. E. L. Dawson,
city physician, and to this end he so
licits the co-operation of every boy and
girl in the city. And his appeal does
not end w ith the' youngsters, but in
cludes the grown-ups as well. One of
the latter was the first to respond to
the call embracing an offer of two
cents a quart for all of these perni
cious pests captured in Chickasha. W.
I.. Edward., residing at No. 512 Penn
sylvania avenue, was the first person
to draw any revenue from this fund,
havi.'ig pocketed ten cents yesterday
afternoon for his delivery of 'iv
quarts of health destroyers.
"If everyone in town would work at
this," declared the health officer, "we
could destroy every fly in thfo town."

Says United States, Though Not Cruel,
is Negligent of Welfare of Families
of Troopers; A Condition Which
Does Not Exist in Europe
, Ily William G. Shepherd,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
San Antonio, Tex., July 20. Not one
soldier with whom I rubbed elbows
within all the armies of Europe in tho
past two years, ever worried as much
as some of these American soldiers
along the edge of Mexico. These
American are worrying about their
families back home and do not know'
whether their wives and children have
enough to eat.
Such a deplorable condition is not
possible to exist in any European
army, for the European governments
care for the families of their soldiers.
If the Germans knew that the British
ers were treating the families of their
soldiers as we are treating ours, or
, vire versa, the fact would be blazoned
to the world as an indication of gov
ernmental cruelty by the enemy. It is
not cruelty on our part, however, but
only an oversight and the lesson we
have learned has cost unhappiness ann
embarrassment in many American
homes.

I asked General Funston if a man
can be a good soldier if he is wonder
ing whether ills family back home has
enough to eat. "Of course not," he re
plied. "I permitted fourteen men to
return home yesterday because their
dependents' were suffering and I have
so many requests for relief on like
grounds that it will prove necessary
to release thousands of men in the
next few weeks.
Money Well Spent.
"The money which has been spent
in bringing the militia to the border,
feeding them and equipping them, and
then, after two weeks, sending them
back home. Isn't wasted," he added.
"It Is our payment for a lesson which
we must learn that we must provide
for the care of our soldiers' families
if we. are going to insist on taking
men away from their families. and puf-
.'ting them into the army.
"'What about my family?' is the big.

DANGER

,
Precautions, However, are Being Taken
Against Infantile Paralysis Spread
Should Case Be Found
!
l
Every precaution Is being taker. In
Grady county by Dr. L. K. Emanuel,
health officer, to avert tho introduc
tion and spread of infantile paralysis
in this part ot the world. At the same
time precautions are being taken by
the state board of public health to
avoid any unnecessary uneasiness over
the situation or the prospect of Its in
tro'i;tcliou. Commissioner John -W.
Duke has cautioned all county health
officers against making premature re
ports of the discovery of this disease
and suggests that they be thoroughly
convinced that the diagnosis is cor
rect, before reporting it to the state
board of health. The report, he says,
becomes a public document as soon as
received in his office and a few mis
taken diagnoses regarding the disease
would throw the people of the state
Into a panic.
The board of health, he nays, is anx.
lous to have all cases reported -.it
dees not want uncertain cases report
ed. Ue adds:
Don't Give Out Interviews.
"Please send us the information by
vire at the expense of this office but
under no circumstances give inter
views to anyone else."
As an example of the precautions
which are being taken Dr. Emanuel
nas sen i me following letter to every
physician In the county outside of the
city of Chickasha:
"Dear Doctor:
"Since there Is at this time In all
sections of the United States, and es
pecially In the east, infantile paraly
sis, and a few cases in our own state,
as county superintendent of health, I
desire to ask your co-operation and
alertness, If at any time you find a sus- crossing the track between the cars,
picious case, to report to me by tele- and another one following close be
phone at my expense the very moment hind. At this moment the coupling
diagnosis is made, and I will lend you ' was made about at the elevator. The
all assistance

"Dr. Duke, state
health, has requested of all county;
health officers to keep a close lookout
for the development of all cases of this '
character." j

He accompanied the trains as far as

Inquest Held Over Body of Ellsworth
Hushey Throws No Further Light
on Exact Manner of Death
The inquebt which was held over
the body of little Ellsworth Iluakey,
who was killed in the yards by a Rock
Island train yesterday afternoon, fur
nished no further details as to tha
manner in which the boy came to bin
death than were rontained ln tha ac
count published in the Express yester
day afternoon. From the little Keyes
boys, who were, not on the stand, how.
ever, but who were with Ellsworth,
shortly before the accident, it was
learned that at the place where Ells
worth met his death werti two box
cars, about six feet apart, through
which he attempted to pass. Wheu
the engine shunted other cars into tho
siding these two cars collided, catch
ing the boy between them. No one
so far as can be learned, however, wit
nessed the accident at the time of
compact.
At the inquest in the office of Jus-
tlce of the Peace T. P. Moore at 4 : 30
o'clock yesterday, Dr. D. S. Downey
was the first witness called. When
he reached the scene life was not yet
extinct but the only breathing wus a
death gasp.
Dr. Downey Testifies.
The physician noted a small bruise
on the left foreram about an inch and
a half long through the skin, the mus
cles of the arm being lacerated. j Tho
fatal bruise extended 18 Or 20 iichen
along the chest, on the right siite, th
full length, of thtj r(bsn .,AU the fUw
on the right side were broken, as wiere
many on the left. There were also
bruises in the side and along the spline
and bleeding at the nose indicated itho
injury to the lower base of the biiiin.
The lumjs were also punctured by the
broken ribs. The crushing of the Tib
was sufficient to cause death, the wit'
ness asserted.
Young Brother on Stand.
David Carlisle Huskey, the teu.year
old brother of the deceased, testified
that he and his brother had been
shooting birds under the viaduct with
nigger shooters. Returning to town ha
crossed the track ahead of his brother
and did not hear the engine. When
about four feet of the other aide bo
heard the crashing occasioned by tho
collision of the two cars and heard his
brother cry out. That was tha first
he knew that Ellsworth bad been
caught. ( When he crossed the cars
were not movlug, he said, and were
about six feet apart.
Caught Between Drawbars.
A. Womack, who has a position at
the Rock Island freight office, was tho
nearest to being an eye witness to the,
tragedy. He had just returned from a
trip to the Santa Ke yards delivering
a waybill and had taken a seat in his
office when he noticed onf small boy
.slack iu the cars caught the bov he-
superintendent of.tween the drawbars. When the cars
came together they hid the boy from
his view until the curs came back and
dropped him to the ground. The child
tried to get away and fell on the west
rail. He ran to his aid but was beaten
there by a man from the Chickasha
mill, who had removed the boy from
the- rail. The accident occurred on
a side track, the industrial track at
the Chickasha mills. He said this was
not. a regular crossing for the public.
Carried the Boy Awiy,
W. W. Vale, superintendent of Ihe
Chit kasha Milling company, was Bit
ting under the viaduct when the acci
dent occurred. He heard the cars
moving but paid no attention to them
till lie heard a boy shouting for help.
He ran in that direction and saw an
other boy lying on the track. He
thought th child had fainted so he
Picked him up and carried him Over to
ia Place under the viaduct where he
every day but it is not
a pufcic cros-
ing.
