ST. PAUL BUSINESS
MEN HERE JULY 28
SPECIAL TRAIN WILL BRING 100
BUSINESS MEN FROM THE
SAINTLY CITY
A party of 75 to 100 of the leading
wholesale merchants and manufac
turers of the city of St. Paul will
will visit Williston July 28, arriving
8 a. m. and remaining for 50 minutes.
The trip is arranged under the aus
pices of the St. Paul Association of
Commerce—the leading civic and
commercial organization of the city,'
—to which all of the merchants and
manufacturers belong.
Trade Excursions or "Booster
Trips'' as they are popularly spoken
of, have become a regular summer
featui*e of the work of the Associa
tion of Commerce. For several years,
two trips of a week each, have keen
taken, and practically every portion
of St. Paul's great trade territory
has been visited. Since the members
of the party have not? visited Montana
for some time, however, and as that
"State has made rapid strides in popu
lation and development since their
last visit, the partv h8= ^'W'iderl
spend two full wdteks visiting points
in Montana and North Dakota, mi
the lines of the Northern Pacific,
Great Northern a C. M. & St. P. Rys,
The purpose of these excursions is to
give the wholesalers and manufac
turers an opportunity to call upon
their friends and customers at tneir
own places of business, and get a
first-hand acquaintance with their
territory and trade conditions. In
reality they are not trade excursions,
because no effort is made to sell goods
or establish trade relations. They
could be more properly styled "so
cialibility trips." Their object is first
and last, better acquaintance and good
fellowship.
The party travels in a special
train, leaving St. Paul at noon, Sun
day, July 16. The train consists of
baggage car, two dining cars, one
tourists sleeper for employes, five
standard Pullman sleepers, and one
observation car. The party live upon
their train during the entire two
weeks.
The Minnesota State Band of
twenty-three pieces, the crack band
of the Northwest, led by A. L. Snyder,
accompanies the party and a concert
will be given on Main street between
8 and 9 o'clock Friday morning, the
train remaining here 50 minutes.
On WedMsday, July 26 the special
will arrive at Sidnew at 11:30 a. m.
and will leave at 12:30 for a tour
across McKenzie county, stopping for
15 minutes at each Watford, Alex
ander, Charbonneau, Cartwright and
returning to Fairview, Montana will
remain overnight and on July 28
will visit at all stations from Fair
view to Scobey, spending: about an
hour at the latter place and 5 hours
and 25 minutes at Plentywood.

MRS. ROWLAND NOT GUILTY
Mrs. Mary Rowland, charged «js "n
accomplice with her husband in the
killing of young Harry Wolcott of
Mountraill county, fas acquitted by
a jury in district court Saturday af
ternoon, after she had been on trial
for a week. The jury reached its ver
dict in less than an hour.
Her husband was convicted of the
murder last week and sentenced to
twenty years in the penitentiary.
Birth Of A Nation
At Williston Armory
In the list of accurate battle scenes
and maneuvers in Griffith's "Birth Of
A Nation," noted pictorial drama of
the Civil War, which visualizes the
problem of slavery and state soveren
ity, now attracting large audiences in
several of the large cities, and which
Manager McGuiness is bringing here
for presentation, is an accurate re
production of Sherman's march to the
sea. It depicts realistic views of the
Union Troops passing through Geor
gia, the burning of Atlanta, etc., etc.
Sherman's move was one of the
decisive acts of the long, hard-fought
war as it divided the south and took
awav food supplies which were needed
for 'the support of the Confederate
Army.
The siege of Atlanta and the flight
of the population to the country is
also a realistic reproduction of a his
torical event. In this and in all of
the battle scenes, D. W. Griffith, the
producer, obeyed the directions of
military experts who mapped out the
movements of the Union and_ Con
federate armier as described in the
accurate reports in the possession of
the United States government. In
fact, many weeks were spent in the
acquirement of data for the staging
of the battle scenes.
Many old soldiers have witnessed
and approved of these reproductions,
saying that they recalled with vivid
impressiveness the hazardous exper
iences which they endured in army
service.
Portions impress one with a lasting
sense of the suffering due to hunger,
showing Confederate soldiers on the
firing line eating sparingly of short
rations ©f parched corn—in another,
the capture of a supply train is an
impressive lesson of the hardships of
war.
The splendid bringing of this
mighty attraction to this city, by
Manager McGuiness is not alone con
spicuous for the enormity of the ac
complishment (which is the very
greatest any manager could do for
his patrons) but the event of Griffith's
Birth of A Nation for 4 days, July
24-25-26-27. here will long be remem
bered as one of the greatest occa
sions in the history of the city, ac
companied by their celebrated sym
phony orchestra of 25 musicians.
Geo. S. Loftus Died
Sunday Evening
Fargo, July 17.—George S. Loftus,
sales manager of the Equity Co-op
erative Exchange, died last night at
8:50 o'clock at the home of his sister
in St. Paul after an illness of almost
a year.
The death of Mr. Loftus, while not
unexpected, comes as a great shock
to a large number of people over the
state of North Dakota, especially so
to the members of the Equity, whose
battles Mr. Loftus had been fighting
since he became connected with the
organization.
A
telegram received at Equity
headquarters here this morning from
J. G. Crites stated that Mr. Loftus
suffered terribly toward the last, his
ailment being one that caused great
suffering all during his illness. His
death wtfs due to cancer of the bowels.
Mr. Loftus was 43 or 44 years of
age. He leaves a wife, three daugh
ters and one son, in the immediate
family, all of whom were with him at
the time of his death. The deceased
was born in Wisconsin. For a number
of years he was connected with one
of the leading western railroads and
was considered one of the greatest
rate experts of the northwest. After
leaving the railroad business Mr.
Loftus entered the commission busi
ness, being an active member of the
firm of the Loftus Hubbai'd Co. In
July, 1912, he became sales manager
of the Equity, and after his connec
tion with that organization, traveled
considerably throughout the state of
North Dakota, where he became
known to practically every farmer of
the commonwealth.
Mr. Loftus was taken ill at Minot,
N. D., in August, 1915, and since
that time had steadily declined. He
went to Florida for his health, spend
ing all of last winter there. There
were several times during his illness
that he was not expected to live, but
his remarkable constitution pulled
him through on each occasion.
The death of Mr. Loftus takes from
the Equity one of its most active
workers.
A telegram received this morning
at Equity headquarters from Mrs.
Loftus states that the funeral will be
held Wednesday afternoon at two
o'clock. No other information was
given, but it is presumed that it will
be held from the residence of the sis
ter. The telegram from J. G. Crites
stated that the funeral will be in
charge of the Equity.
NEW HOMESTEAD LAW
A bill recently passed by congress,
approved July 3, 1916( amends the
enlarged homestead act and pro
vides in substance that any person
who has made or shall make home
stead entry of less than 320 acres of
the character described in the enlarg
ed homestead act, and who has made
proof on same shall have the right
to enter public lands subject to the
provisions of this act, not contigu
ous to his first entry, which shall
not, with the original entry, exceed
320 acres Provided, that the entry
man must reside upon and cultivate
this additional entry in conformity
with the homestead laws, except that
where the land in the additional entry
is located not exceeding 20 miles from
that in the original entry no residence
shall be required on the additional
entry if the entryman is residing on
his former entry.
WILL ORPET FREED
OF GIRL'S MURDER
One Votes for Guilty
Williston Graphic
MARION LAMBERT KILLED SELF
AT LOVE TRYST, IS THEORY
ACCEPTED
Waukegan, 111., July 15—Will Orpet
was acquitted tonight of the accusa
tion of Marion Lambert's murder.
The jury that for six weeks had
heard two versions of the tragedy of
Helm's Wood, where Marian was
found dead in the snow on February
10, chose the version of the defense
—that Marian committed suicide.
The verdict was returned at 7:45
o'clock, and 30 minutes later Orpet
was speeding towards his father's
home at Lake Forest to spend his first
night out of jail since Feb. 11.
The jury took four ballots. The first
three stood 11 to 1 for. acquittal, and
the lone opponent of not guilty ver
dict was won over after the jury had
returned from supper.
The courtroom was jammed when
the verdict came in. As the word "not"
was framed, Orpet leaped to his feet,
flung his arms about his mother's
neck and smiled.
A great shout rang clear to the
rafters of the courthouse. Some one
in the crowd shouted "horrors!"
"Get that man,'' ordered Judge Don
nelly. "If I can find him he can spend
at least five hours in the cell where
Orpet has spent five months." But
the bailiffs couldn't find him.
Orpet Thanks Jurors
Orpet rushed up to the judge, the
jury, the lawyers and the spectators.
He grabbed every hand that was
thrust out at him. Then he turned to
the reporters.
"Here's what I want to say," he be
gan, and then he dictated:
"I am grateful to the jury I am
grateful to my counsel. I appre
ciate that I have had a hard fight,
but I have stood it because I was
innocent. I have no hard feelings. I
hope to go out into the world and
prove to my friends that I will merit
their confidence, friendship and
honor."
Orpet's father was not in the court
room. Neither was Frand Lambert,
father of Marion. Some of the neigh
bors took the news to the Lamberts.
They only shook their heads.
Mother Strokes Son's Hair
"My boy, my boy," Mrs. Orpet said,
fondlirtg the brown hair of her son.
Orpet's face did not lose its prison
nallor, his cheeks were not flushed,
but he smiled gladly.
As the courtroom was cleared of its
throng, Orpet, arm in arm with his
mother, walked out of the courtroom
and to the automobile that was wait
ing. His mother had never a single
doubt of his acquittal, and was pre
pared to take him home.
The last time he was in Lake Forest
was the night before his death tryst
with Marion.
Suicide Theory Upheld
The state had contended that Orpet,
at this tryst, gave Marion cyanide of
potassium under guise of an abortive,
because he was tired of her and want
ed to marry Celeste Youker.
The defense contended that Marion,
tired of life, and fearing she was to
become a mother, killed herself. Or
pet's own story of the tryst bore out
this latter story. He said he had told
Marion he would not write her or
Picknickers
soon
ket
see
her again, and that she took some
kind of poison and died.
One of the jurors said tonight the
jury's opinion was that the state had
not proved its case.
L. C. Stevenson, general manager
of the organization taking care of the
distribution of Studebaker automo
biles in Montana, Northern Wyoming
and Western Montana, with General
offices at Billings, Montana, and
branches at most convenient points
in Montana for serving dealers and
owners of the very popular Stude
baker cars, spent Friday, Saturday
and Sunday in Williston conferring
with Messrs Monroe Brothers over
plans for establishing a similar
branch at this point. Messrs Monroe
Brothers are interested in the busi
ness and in addition to being local
managers for the Company's territory
in Western North Dakota and North
eastern Montana, will handle this
popular line exclusively for the re
tail territory in and around Williston,
and will of course continue their high
grade and popular service to owners
and nearby dealers. Several trained
salesmen will also be in the field to
co-operate with Studebaker dealers in
this territory.
Mr. Stevenson and Mrs. Monroe, in
talking with The Graphic also stated
that an extensive advertising cam
paign would soon be inaugurated
throughout the territory to further
acquaint .prospective car buyers with
their many superior points and value
of the Studebaker Series 17 models.
Both Mr. Monroe and Mr. Stevenson
stated that it was easy to show the
car buyer who wants a thoroughly

THIRD ANNUAL PICNIC ATTEND
ED BY 2,000 FARMERS AND

The Third Annual Corn and Alfalfa
Picnic of Williams county was held
a the Sub-Experiment station last Fri
day under the auspices of the Willis
ton Township Farm club.
The attendance was not as large
as it was on the two year previous, ow
ing to the fact that many from town
did not attend, or rather did not spend
the
day
there but simply made a brief
visit. However almost every part of
the county was represente by large
delegations, thus giving a very rep
resentative gathering for the occa

began arriving early,
the majority from the more distant
places by auto and a merry throng
was
making good use of the bas­
lunches
that had been brought to
the grounds. The Williston band en
livened
the
occasion by a number of
selections both in the afternoon and
during the program.
People arriving in Williston or who
wished to visit the city were given
free transportation by automobiles
which members of the Commercial
club
had
provided.
Mr. Bartholomew was chairman of
the day and welcomed the guests on
behalf of the Williston Township
Farm club, and introduced the speak
ers. Herman Nelson, president of the
Williams County Better Farming as
sociation was the first speaker, and
his discourse was exceedingly inter
esting.
Base Ball Game
As an entertainment feature the
Williston Commercial club provided
free tickets for the Minot-Williston
game to all the guests at the picnic.
The pate receipts for paid admissions
was $113.00 and the Commercial club
made up the balance of $200 which
the baseball club received for the
game.
In the evening the platform was
cleared and arrangements made for
holding a big dance, but unfortunate
ly a shower came up just as it was
time for the dance to start and the
crowd was obliged to seek shelter and
then this necessitated the abandon
ing of this part of the program. The
following evening it was again plan
to hold a dance but an unfor
tunate delay in the arrival of the
piano for the use of the orchestra
again delayed starting and when the
piano was finally placed on the stage
another shower broke and again the
large crowd which had been waiting
was dispersed. However this feature
was but a detail and did not mar the
picnic at all as the program for the
day had been carried out to perfec
tion.
MR. BENTON IMPROVING
In a recent issue The Graphic pub
lished an article taken from The Far
go Forum stating that Mr. Benton
who was injured on the railroad near
Minot last winter, and who has been
in a precarious condition ever since,
was hopelessly insane.
We are pleased to announce that
this statement has proven to be at
least partially in error as the latest
reports state that Mr. Benton is im
proving quite rapidly and that he may
be able to return to his home after a
short time, fully recovered of his
faculties. Friends of Mr. Benton and
his family will be very glad indeed to
learn of his improvement.

to $500 more value for his money in
the Series 17 Studebakers, than in
any other line now on the market, and
that they only. asked the buyer to
make his own thorough investigation
to prove this statement.
The Studebakers are made in both
four and six cylinder models, of
3, 5 or 7 passenger capacity are up

George VVhall Killed
Self In County Jail
George Whall, alias Robert Whee
ler, killed himself shortly before 8
o'clocking Saturday morning, by cut
ting his throat with a razor, dying
within five minutes. Whall was in
his cell at the county bastile at the
time of committing the act, and had
just finished shaving himself, after
asking the use of a razor.
Breakfast was being served to the
inmates and an unusual noise in
Whall's cell attracted the attention
of the sheriff who hastened to inves
tigate and as he opened the cell door
the dying man staggered out and fell
in the corridor expiring befoi'e any
thing could be done toward saving his
life. He had cut his head nearly half
off, apparently in one slash of the
razor and died almost instantly from
the loss of blood.
The body was removed to the Hamre
undertaking parlors and prepared for
burial, the funeral service being con
ducted Monday afternoon under the
auspices of the Moose Lodge of Ray,
interment in the Williston cemetery.
Before committing the rash deed
Whall wrote a note asking that a
brother in Canada be notified of his
death, and also sating tlint, his true
name was George Whall instead of
Robert Wheeler, the name by which
he was known here and at Ray. He
was about 30 years of age, and had
just commenced serving a four and a
half month's sentence for blindpig
ging at Ray, after having pled guilty
to the charge on June 2(5. He was
arrested on May 31 by Deputy Axel
Strom.
A message from his brother in Can
ada sanctioned the interment as ar
ranged for by the lodge.
Passengers Trains
Collide Near Todd
No. 4, the Great Northern's crack
coast train known as the Glacier Park
Limited, had a head-on collision with
the local Williston-Glasgovv train last
Monday morning about 7 o'clock at
the Todd siding six miles west of Wil
liston. Fortunately no one was kill
ed or dangerously injured in the acci
dent, although passengers on L«?th
trains were badly shaken up and quite
a number received bruises and cuts.
Mrs. C. M. Graves of Portland, Ore.,
was thrown through a glass door and
was quite badly cut and scratched.
However it is little short of a ciracle
that a large list of killed and Injured
did not result, as the coast train was
late and running fast and the track at
the point where the accident occurred
is crooked and the track at many
places in that vicinity runs along the
bank of deep coulees. Both trains
were heavy, the local was drawn by
two engines which, perhaps, accounts
for the slight damage to the lighter
cars of the local, which ordinarily
would have been likely to "telescone"
when struck by the heavy train. The
train crews jumped in time to escape
injury. The front engine of the local
train was demolished by the impq^t.
The local train consisted of the Mc
Kenzie county local train, the Scobey
Plentywood train and the Glasgow
local all three being taken to Snowden
where the trains were to be separated
for their several routes.
It is supposed the trains were to
have passed at Todd but No. 4 got
there first and passed the switch.
Williston's ball team was on No.
4 and the boys all got a good big jolt

OPPORTUNES TAKE
MANY GAMES IN WEEK
WILL MEET FAMOUS ALL NA
TIONS TEAM HERE JULY 29-30
AT MINOT NOW
Williston's baseball aggregation,
"The Opportunes," having been har
vesting games right along recently
and in this way living up to their ex
cellent reputation established earlier
in the season.
Here is a list of the games played
since July 12:
Minot v. Williston, at Williston:
July 12—Minot 1, Williston 12.
July 13—Minot 0, Williston 9.
July 14—Minot 2, Williston 3.
Glasgow v. Williston at Glasgow:
July 15—Glasgow 9, Williston 2.
July 1(3—Double header, Glasgow
4, Williston 10 second game, Glas
gow 6, Williston 14.
In the second game with Minot an
altercation arose when Marshall was
put into the game for the home team
without being announced by the um
pire. Minot was in the lead at the
time but Williston was gaining when
the dispute arose. The manager of
the local team offered to return the
men to the bases where they were at
the beginning of the play and bat
again or to let the men remain as
they were and be called out. How
ever Minot's manager was not in a
concilatory mood and refused to con
tinue the game and thus it was for
feited to Williston. A baseball au
thority later upheld Williston, al
though the umpire was acknowledged
to be at fault by his failure to an
nounce the new man put in.
The Opportunes go to Minot Fri
day to open a three-game series with
the Magicians on their field which will
be played July 21, 22, 23.
On July 25, 26 and 27 the Oppor
tunes will take on the Plentywood
team at Bruegger Park, and for a
big attraction the home boys will meet
the famous All Nations at Williston
on Saturday and Sunday, July 29-30.
This will be an unusually interesting
game, and especially so if the home
boys win at Minot and with Plenty
wood.
Judge Fisk has decided not to hold
a term of court in McKenzie county
at this time ,as the farmers are very
busy with haying operations at this
time and to call a iury at this time
would result in much inconvenience if
not actual losp. The criminal cases
will go over to the October term and
the judge will hear civil actions the
latter part of July or first of August
Festival For
Ray In August
Ray, N. D., July 20.—The Grain
Palace Festival Committee composed
of W. A. Morin, C. F. Peterson and
Atty. A. G. J. Anderson who have in
charge the work of raising the funds
and making the arrangements for the
Festival to be held here August 4th
and 5th, are busy all the time with
the preliminaries and have been very
successful in getting the citizens to
subscribe liberal amounts for this
purpose. It is expected that about
$1,500.00 will be raised this season
and that the entire amount will be
paid out as premiums and prizes for
exhibits of grains, vegetables, fruits
and exhibits of stock and also will
include the prizes for the races and
other funds.
The premium lists are now being
made out and will be a lengthy as
well as a very liberal one. The prizes
will be larger than previous year3
which will be an incentive for the
farmers and other exhibitors to take
pains to bring in the best of their
products for the exhibition. The com
mittee in charge are now lining up
outside attractions to be here during
the entire two days and these features
will be of the best in the northwest.
Foreign talent will also be in the city
as the present European war has
brought hundreds of acrobats and
athletic experts to the United States
and several of these artists are now
in the western states so that it will
be possible to secure them for these
days to help entertain the people.
Crop Conditions Are
Good In Williams
At some time during the past ten
days every part of Williams county
has received rain, and the greater
part of the northwestern corner of
the state has had a period of cool
weather following a heavy rainfall.
This has put the crops in an excep
tionally fine condition, and one big
crop—'hay—is already assured and
will be heavier than for several years
past.
There were reports of slight dam
age by hail, but nothing of any conse
quence so far as is known here. Mon
day night there was a heavy rain in
the northern part of the county, and
in fact all around Williston but no
rain fell here. However this vicinity
had just been visited by 24-hour rain
fall and was not in need of more mois
ture. The storm of Monday night, did
considerable damage in northern Wil
liams county and also in Divide coun
ty where it was the most severe, the
wind blowing down a number of barns
and damaging houses and other prop
erty. The lightning also killed some
livestock both in pastures and in
buildings. At Fortuna on the Soo a
lumberyard was scattered about by
the wind.
At Grenora the wind blew several
