QUESTION OF FINANCE
MORE WAYS THAN ONE OF GET
TING A CHECK CASHED.

Ingenious, a Possibility of Getting
Around the Soul-Chilling Edict
“Insufficient Funds.”
i He was in high spirits as he strolled
whistling down Central Park West.
It was spring; his health was good,
the sun was shining brightly, the
birds In the park were twittering mer
rily, and in a poker session the night
before he had won $276, of which $76
was in cash. In an inside pocket a
check for $2OO. the balance of his win
nings. nestled against his heart,
j It was great to be alive anyway, and
wasn't It fine that he had yielded to
his wife’s pleas to be allowed to buy
those spring clothes! The bills for
the clothes had been coming in for a
week now and had worried him some
what, but now, with $276 he had not
expected to get and the money he al
ready had, he would be able to pay
them without difficulty. His wife de
served all the spring clothes he could
buy her. But wasn’t It lucky that he
i had drawn that fourth Jack against
that ace full the night before?
He reached the bank on which the
$2OO check had been drawn and
blithely swung through the doors, In
dorsed the paper and presented It at
the paying teller’s window.
There was a pause while the teller
got busy with his books. In a moment
he was back at the window;
“Insufficient funds,” he said.
The sun was obscured behind black
clouds, the birds In the park were
squawking horribly, forgotten pains
began to remind our hero of their
existence.
If the maker of the check was the
kind of man who would give an N. O.
check to pay a poker loss, he was
eurely not the kind of man who would
make good later, thought the holder of
the worthless paper. Then he had an
Idea. He asked the teller how much
the check's maker had on deposit, but
the teller refused to Inform him; say
ing It was against the rules.
Over on a park bench our hero pon
dered his problem. At length he reach
| ed a solution.
The check’i maker was In the the
atrical business. Our hero visited a
press agent of his acquaintance and
got a couple of complimentary tickets.
Then he vlajted the bank again. From
the special guard he learned the pay
ing teller’s name.
Then he wrote a note to the paying
teller, enclosing the theater tickets,
and to It he signed the name of the
maker of the check. He sent the note
and tickets by special messenger to
the teller.
Then after waiting half an hour he
called up the bank and asked to talk
to the teller. When he was connected
he gave the name of the maker of
the check, talked pleasantly for a mo
ment about the theater tickets he had
Just sent, and then asked how large
his balance was.
The teller, glad to do the favor to
one who had Just sent him two theater
tickets, answered.
“One hundred and forty-three dol
lars,” he said.
Our hero after a comment or two
hung up the receiver and walked
straight around to the bank.
Here he questioned the receiving
teller to make sure there would be
no slip in his plan.
"Can I deposit money to another
man’s account?” he asked.
"Certainly,” said the receiving tell
er. “We're always glad to get money
from everybody.”
Our hero then made out a deposit
slip for $6O, under the name of the
maker of the check, and shoved the
slip and $6O through the receiving
teller's window.
Then he walked to the paying teller
with his $2OO check.
"I’d like cash for this,” he said.
The paying teller looked at the
check and repeated his "Insufficient
funds,” but our hero said loftily:
"Pardon, but a deposit which makes
the check good was Just received.”
The paying teller looked It up and
found this to be correct, so there was
nothing left for him to do but pay out
the money. At a cost of $6O our hero
had made a bad check for $2OO good.
Again was the sun shining and again
were the birds twittering.—New York
Times.
In Defense of the Toothbrush.
Dr. T. Benedict Furnlss defends
the toothbrush, In “Oral Hygiene,”
from the attacks recently made upon
It by Dr. Bernard Feldman. Until Its
enemies devise something better, he
says, it will not help matters to throw
out the best thing for cleaning the
teeth that we know anything about.
"It must be remembered thaf the
tooth bristles, bathed and saturated so
frequently with tooth paste Ingredi
ents more or less antiseptic, furnish
anything but a happy abiding for
germ pests, no matter how vital and
resistant they may be. So that If we
merely hang the toothbrush some
where in the sunshine after each wash
ing of the mouth and teeth and buy a
new brush at decent intervals, we
need not get worrying about virulent
bacteria.”
Thrift.
"What did you do with that car
load of eggs that was condemned by
the board of health?”
“I’m going to make a lot of money
on those. I’m having them made into
gas bombs to ship to the war zone.”

FOLLOW THE ANCIENT RITUAL
Samaritans of Today Observe the
Passover With All the Traditional
Ceremonies Ordered.
“The Samaritans stood close togeth
er to prevent the Mahometan specta
tors. who delight to torment them,
from snatching even a bit of wool,
which would remain over and thus
cause them to break the command,
■Ye shall let nothing of It remain until
the morning,’ ’’ says a writer In the
Christian Herald.
“After e’eansing the lambs they re
moved a front leg of each, and these
were set apart as the priest’s portion.
A long wooden pole was then threaded
through each of the prepared lambs,
and was carried thus to the pit near
by, wherein a largo fire, which had
been kindled early in the evening, had
burned down, leaving a hod of red-hot
coals at the bottom. The poles, pro
tected by metal at the lower end. were
stuck Into this bed of coals, being long
enough to reach to the top of the pit,
the lambs thus suspended about half
way up. A matting was placed over
the mouth of the pit, which In turn
was covered with earth, making a sort
of Improvised oven, for the law de
mands that ‘they he roast with fire,
not sodden with water.’
“The sheep were left to roast until
midnight—the appointed hour—and all
but the guards retired to their tents
during the Interval.
“Being the guests of the Kahln, we
went to his tent, and he edified ns by
reading the various laws In Leviticus
concerning the sacrifices, besides the
chapter which gives the narrative of
the first Passover.”
EYES TOO MUCH NEGLECTED
Residents of Cities, in the Aggregate,
Are the Chief Offenders, for
Various Reasons.
The farmer at work In his fields n'l
day long has much better eyesight
than the city resident. Farmers, as a
rule, have no need of artificial aid to
the eyes until old ago conies upon
them.
On the farm the eyes receive more
rest than In the city, because they
work at more natural angles. The
farmer s work Is not right up under
his nose. In cases of most city peo
ple their work is over books or ma
chines, and they have a habit of stoop
ing over It.
This affects the eyes so that glasses
are necessary for relief. Nine-tenths
of the people who are suffering from
headaches and who wonder what the
trouble Is can blame them on the treat
ment they give their eyes. Not enough
city people wear glasses. Perhaps one
In fifty wears glasses where the av
erage should be about ono In every ten.
Children are affected in this way.
Most children lean over their desks
and have their eyes close to their
books. Teachers should prevent them
from doing this. Where children are
forced to wear glasses it Is not neces
sary that they should have to wear
them all the time. When the children
are at play they ought. In most cases,
to be allowed to go without their
glasses.
Cultivating Beauty.
If the busy housewife can spare an
hour or so each day In the exercise
necessary to retain her youth and
beauty, all well and good. But If not
each daily task can bo utilized to im
prove some part of the body. Dash
ing cold water, followed by hard rub
bing, tones up the skin and prevents
colds, Improves the circulation and
takes no more time than a languid rub
with a wash cloth. Even dressing can
be made useful In this respect when
the housewife leans down to button
her shoes. The knees should be kept
rigid and the bending should be en
tirely at the waist. Instead of sitting
to dress the hair, hang the mirror at
a convenient height and as you put
In the pins rise and fall slowly on tho
toes, keeping the chest well up. This
strengthens tho back and ankles to a
great extent.
Great Waste of Ink.
He entered the West hotel, a fine,
courtly southern gentleman, very af
fable and genial, says tho Minneapolis
Tribune. And this is what he wrote
on the register.
"Hinton Graves Lee, resident In Au
gusta, Ga., prior to February 1, and In
Georgia state since 1852, now resident
at Kansas City, Mo., and Kansas City,
Kan.”
Clerks A. D. Hein and A. M. Shartin
looked It over and had a whispered
consultation.
“Think of It,” said Hein. "Why.
the Ink firm could afford to pay the
traveling expenses and a good salary
to Mr. Lee. If that habit ever spreads,
there wouldn’t be ink enough In the
United States to go around."
Paper and Ink for Our Money.
In the manufacture and printing of
the paper money of the United States
It is necessary that there shall be im
ported materials from various parts of
the world. A part of the paper fiber,
for Instance, Is linen rag from the
Orient. The silk that furnishes tho
strands that are run through the pa
per as a safeguard against counter
feiting comes from China or from
Italy. The blue ink contains cobalt
from Canada or Germany. The black
Ink Is said to be made at Niagara
Falls from acetylene gas smoke; and
the greater part of the green Ink is
made with white zinc sulphite, de
rived from German sources. The red

4 Rider 4

By Walter Delaney
(Copyright, 1916. by W. O. Chapman.)
I was for years a train rider. Do
you know what that means? If you
do, you are wiser than the great ma
jority, for the phrase is a new one
and covers a culling somewhat
unique. A train rider I was, with all
its jar, risk and peril, and would prob
ably be one today but for Imogeno—
peerless, patient, practical— sharing
all my joys.
A train rider is n man not listed as
a railroad employee, but always on
their corporate pay roll. He is a spe
cial ollicer. The pay is eighty-live
dollars per month, and fifteen dollars
extra for expenses. The work is
neither regular nor onerous, only the
train rider of a railroad division must
be at the censorious and unalterable
beck and call of the railroad at all
odd, even or unusual hours.
In a word, my functions were these:
to proceed on ordt r to a certain train,
to locate a special freight car and un
til that car left the end of the division
not to allow it or Its contents to leave
my sight for a single moment of time.
When 1 turned my watch and ward
over to the car rider of the next di
vision my duties were completed, all
except sending in a report of any un
toward incidents that might attend
the transmission of the car of which I
was the guardian.
Sometimes it was a blooded horse,
more often an opulent shipment of
bullion, once a few small boxes con
taining watch springs. Valueless
seeming tiny pieces of steel, 1 was
A Red-Faced, Excited Man Rushed Up.
amazed when 1 learned that this pre
cious consignment represented near
ly a million dollars.
1 was notified to meet a freight at
Hopeton at noon one day and present
ed myself to find the train stationary
on a switch at the end of the yard.
Beyond this was the residence sec
tion and open country. .My car was
No. 4321 A, 1 recall. 1 saw to the
seals, made a memoranda of the
transit card and mounted to my post
on tho top of the car. It had a small
grated window at either end and a
movable ventilator trap about the cen
ter of tho car 1 opened this and in
vestigated tho interior of the car, for
it was a slow run of some eighteen
hours. In case of rain 1 was at liberty
to go inside. 1 flashed my electric
light tube down into the dark void be
neath, made out what from experi
ence 1 took to be a shipment of bro
cades and velvets and marked out
the spot where 1 would rest if driven
to shelter by the elements.
A call from tire brakeman down the
track sent mo toward tire iron ladder
at the side of the car. .lust as I
reached the edge of the roof to de
scend I drew back. A stranger, as
cending. fairly forced me back. In
wonderment 1 faced a beautiful young
girl, though pale and distracted look
ing. She was gasping for breath and
directed a frightened glance back over
her shoulder. She sank to the car
roof as though exhausted. 1 noticed
that the filmy dress she wore was
torn as if by brambles or fence wire.
She wore no hat or wrap and her hair
was disheveled.
“Does—does this train start soon?
she panted out.
“Why, yes,” 1 answered, “but not
with regular passengers.”
“1 know, I know," she breathed hur
riedly, "but couldn’t I stay here and
ride just a little? I wouldn't make
any trouble. I’d keep real quiet," she
added, with eyes full of a piteous en
treaty that stirred my heart. Just
then the signal whistle was repeated.
“1 will be back in a minute and see
what 1 can do for you,” 1 said, marvel
ing greatly, for at a glance 1 discerned
that this was no girl tramp or that
genus and 1 was at a loss to sense the
cause of her distraction.
When 1 got to the ground down
near the caboose the conductor was
waving a paper. It proved to be or
ders to belt road the car I was in
when we reached a certain junction.
Just as I completed reading it a red
faced, excited man rushed up. Pomp
ous, irascible, I think ho had the
meanest countenance and the most
treacherous eyes I have ever seen.
“You, men!” he shouted. “Have you
seen anything of a girl?” and he rat
tled out a description of the very per
son whom 1 had loft on top of my car.
“Look In the caboose—there’s six
way fares there,” observed the con
ductor, and I hurried back to my car
to find no trace of the mysterious
young lady who had so recently ap
pealed to my chivalry and sympathy.
She was gone. I scanned the level
stretch beyond the tracks, expecting
to glimpse her flying form, for I doubt
ed not that she was a runaway. 1
pitied her if the man 1 had just seen
was her guardian or relative.
She did not drift soon out of my
mind. So vividly had she Impressed
me that 1 could reproduce her mental
ly with clearness. We made our run
and dusk came on Just as we reached
tho Junction. As we made up a new
train and got well on to the belt spur
1 determined to open the trap In tho
root and get inside and by the aid of
my flashlight enjoyed the lunch I hud
tossed among the packages below.
We were just passing an overhead
bridge when I caught a fleeting
glimpse of a descending form. In a
flash my suspicions were excited, and
rightly. A man had dropped to the
roof of the car from the girders. He
bore down upon mo.
Of course I realized what was do
ing. A gang were after the contents
of the special car, and here was the
forerunner of the group. He made for
me and wo collided. I went Hat, and
he, too. He was Intent on throwing
me off the car and later cast the pre
cious freight to confreres awaiting
him farther down the line.
1 slid and, lying extended, seized
tho rod of the brake wheel. He would
he upon me in another moment, when
he uttered a sharp cry. Turning, I
saw a figure beside the open trap. 1
saw tlio ankle of my enemy seized.
Ho was swung backwards and then
squarely over the side of the car Into
space.
The girl! In a flashing second I un
derstood It all. She had got down into
the car hours before, doubtless fright
ened into hiding from the man who
was looking for her. She had thrown
back tlio scuttle cover Just in time to
save tlio freight and myself
And now, having shown the cour
age of a true woman, she became tim
id and reticent. I could not Influence
her to explain her situation. “Only
to get away from persecution!” she
uttered more than once, and shud
dered. "Only to find some secluded
home, a shelter, a safe retreat for a
single month!”
1 won upon her confidence during
that strange night journey. When we
reached the terminus 1 took her to the
home of my sister. She told her
everything, but the information was
not imparled to me then.
The company traced the man who
had been halted so summarily in bis
scheme to loot the special cur. They
found him a cripple for life and broke
up his thieving gang.
By tho end of tho month my mys
tery girl became my true love. In an
other thirty days I was ordered by
this imperious little tyrant to abandon
hard work and peril.
"For 1 am an heiress, you see,” said
Elvira, "and tho cruel guardian 1 was
escaping from, bent on forcing me to
marry his son, has no further power
over your loving and happy wife." So
I ceased to boa car rider, but blessed
tho day ever that made me one,
whereby I gained the love of the dear
est little woman in the world.
APT DESCRIPTION OF AIRMAN
Secretary's Bright Thought Abruptly
Put an End to the Troubles of
the Toastmaster.
The toastmaster was preparing for
his duties. Ho looked over the list of
speakers.
"Here Is Von Soar,’’ he said to his
secretary. ‘ He’s lire crazy airman,
you know —the fellow who does acro
batic stunts in midair. I’d like to in
troduce him in some original sort of
way. Can you think of anything?”
The secretary straightway looked
thoughtful.
“flow would it do to call him the
lark of the loop-the-loop?”
“Don't like it.”
“The soaring tumblebug?”
“No, no.”
“The snipe of the somersault?”
“I don’t think he’d be pleased.”
The secretary looked more thought
ful.
“What does he really do?”
“Why, he flies upside down and cuts
figure S's.”
The secretary brightened up.
“Figure B’s I've got It! Call him
the Hying Pretzel!”
“Fine!” cried the toastmaster.
A Day’s Work.
What constitutes a day’s work?—
Hartselle Enterprise. Get up in the
morning, dress, shave with a cheap
razor, bring in enough coal for the
day, hold the baby while breakfast
is being prepared, eat hurriedly, rush
to town, work fiercely at your Job till
dinner; then walk hurriedly homo,
hold the baby while the mid-day meal
1s being put on the table, then after
eating, hurry back to the job. After
which, work till 0:30 and go home for
the evening meal, and hold the baby
while the cook and''the housewife are
preparing the meal. After supper put
the baby to sleep, bring in some more
coal, shut the water off, if it’s a threat
ening night bring the flowers in, put
the cat out, and poke up the fire. If
that isn’t a day’s work it Is because
it takes part of the night to finish
your tasks —Montgomery Advertiser.
SERVES AS PRIVATE
SCION OF ITALIAN ROYAL HOUSE
IN THE RANKS.
Duke of the Abruzzi’s Half-Brother, In
Disgrace, Holds Humble Poslton
In the Armies That His Coun
try Has Mustered.
Though almost every royal house In
Europe Is represented at the front.
Italy's alone can boast of a member
who is a simple soldier, fighting among
the rank and Hie.
Umberto, count of Salemni, shares
the lot and the labors of peasants and
workingmen. Ho Is stationed at Vo
ghera for the moment, lu the regiment
of cavalry guides. His regiment will
soon be dismounted and go into the
trenches.
Then this scion of the house of Sa
voy will tramp side by side with the
rankers and share their trench life on
the exposed and difficult Italian out
posts on the dangerous plateau called
the Carso.
The count Is a son of Prince Ame
deo, late duke of Aosta, who died 16
years ago. His mother, the duke’s
second wife, is a Princess Bonaparte.
She lives in Turin, and her son, in his
soldier’s uniform, Is allowed to visit
her on Sundays, when, with tho other
men of the troop, he has several hours’
leave.
His half-brothers are Emanuel, duke
of Aosta; Victor, count of Turin, and
Louis, duke of the Abruzzi, once the
reputed fiance of Miss Katherine El
kins. The duke of the Abruzzi now
commands Italy’s fleet in the Adri
atic.
The count of Salemnl Is the Only
son of Princess Letltia. He has been
in disgrace for several years, though
the real story Is known to only the
most intimate courtiers While at the
Naval college he committed some
youthful indiscretion, of which even
his fellow cadets had but a vague Idea,
and the king sent him into exile.
For several years he wandered
through Europe, spending months In
Russia, the Balkans, Portugal and
Spain. Always shy and retiring, never
knowing what to do with his great
stature and his hands, a splendid lin
guist, simple In manners, he became
a favorite In Russian society.
When the war broke out he wanted
to serve his country. He begged the
king to allow him to return.
"Yes," came the answer, “but you
must serve as a simple soldier if you
come hack to Italy.”
He came back and was drafted Into
the cavalry guides and sent to the
front. When the regiment returned
for a few weeks he went with It to
the little town of Voghera, Its head
quarters. He Is now returning with
it to fight; but this time the regiment
lights on foot.
The duke of Salemnl performs the
same duties as bis humbler comrades,
and has become so popular that their
affection quite embarrasses him some
times. For instance, when he was go
ing to visit the headquarters of an
other regiment In Voghera they called
out a guard of honor to receive him.
"What's the meaning of this?”
shouted an officer who happened in.
The count murmured that he sup
posed it was for him. He asked his
comrades never to do such a thing
again.
While at the front he distinguished
himself by coolness In handling a
quick-firing gun. On one occasion,
when the men around him were hard
pressed, he saved the situation by ral
lying them.
Medals for ABC Diplomats.
Miss Janet Scudder, one of the
leading sculptors of this country, will
design the three gold medals which
are to be presented by the United
States to Ambassadors Naon of Argen
tina; Da Gama of Brazil and Suarez
of Chile, commonly known as the “A
B C mediators.” Secretary Lansing
awarded the designing to Miss Scud
der.
The medal will bear an inscription
stating that they are presented to the
ambassadors "for their generous serv
ices as mediators In the controversy
between the government of the Unit
ed States and the leaders of the war
ring parties of the Republic of Mex
ico.”
Miss Scudder lives in New York and
takes a prominent part in suffrage
work.
Borrowing a Plano.
Suburbanites are indulging in vari
ous co-operative measures in their
thirst for economy, and neighbors are
getting accustomed to an extension
of the borrowing principle. But one
man, who lives not far from Man
chester, at least thinks the idea has
gone too far. He was surprised the
other day by a request for the loan
of a piano by a neighbor who was giv
ing a musical evening to some friends.
"I have a patriotic reason,” he ex
plained, "as 1 have sold my piano to
buy Exchequer bonds.” When he was
refused he played another card.
"Well, perhaps,” ha said, “you wouldn’t
mind me bringing my friends here for
some music.” —Manchester Guardian.

riculture will attempt to domesticatd
the mink which has been bred spo
radically in captivity for fifty years
or so. The large number of types of
American mink, no less than ten,
prove it to be a "plastic” animal, and
the governmental purpose is to devel
op a higher and more valuable type
than any of those now known.

OXFORD BIBLE WIDELY KNOWN
From Thirty to Forty Copies Are
Printed by the University Press
Every Minute.
The Oxford Bible Is widely known,
but few persons are aware of the tro'
mendous scale on which it Is produced.
The Bible publications of the Ox
ford University press have been is
sued for 300 years, and can be pub
lished In 160 languages and dialects.
Every year fully six hundred tons of
paper are used for this purpose alone.
Orders for 100,000 Bibles are quite
common, and the supply of printed
sheets is so great that an order for
half a million copies can be readily
filled. On an average, from thirty to
forty Bibles are furnished every min
ute, and this number can readily be
doubled.
There are no fewer than 110 differ
ent editions of the Oxford Bible in
English, varying from the magnificent
folio edition for pulpit purposes to the
"brilliant” Bible, the smallest edition
of the Scriptures In the world. Of the
revised version, 14 editions are pub
lished. More than one million copies
of the revised New Testament had
been ordered before the day of publi
cation In May of 1881, and it la
claimed that the workingmen of the
establishment refused a bribe of some
£4,000 to furnish a copy of the book
before the day of Issue.
At a banquet held at the four hun
dredth anniversary celebration of the
beginning of the art of printing In
England by Caxton, Gladstone took
Into his hands and exhibited to those
present a copy of the Bible which had
been printed and bound entirely since
midnight of the preceding day. The
preparation of the “India paper” used
by the Oxford University press is a
business secret of great value. Al
though frequently imitated, it has
never been equaled. The largest folio
Bible printed in Oxford measures 19
by 12 Inches, and no erratum has as
yet been found In It. The "Brilliant
Text Bible” measures 8% by 2%
Inches and Is three-quarters of an inch
thick, and, bound, weighs less than
three ounces.
Presidents of Mexico.
Mexico had no vice president until
1907; up to that year the secretary of
foreign affairs was empowered to act
for the president in case of the sud
den Illness or necessary brief ab
sence of the chief executive. In the
following statements the dates given
are to be understood as the beginning
of the year: 1901 to 1908—President,
General Porllrio Diaz; Secretary of
Foreign Affairs, Don Ignacio Mariscal.
1908 to 1911—President, General Por
llrio Diaz; Vice President, Don Ramon
Corral. October 1, 1911, to February
19, 1913—President, General Francisco
L. Madero, Jr.; Vice President, Lie.
Jose Marla Pino Suarez. From the
murder of Madero, on the last named
date, to the recognition of Venus
tiano Carranza as chief executive of
Mexico by the Pan-American confer
ence, October 19, 1916, Mexico had
only “provisional” presidents: Vlo
torlano Huerta, until July 15, 1914;
Francisco Carbajal, for four weeks af
ter that; General Bulallo Gutierrez,
Roque Gonzales Garza, and Francisco
Lagos Chazaro, successively, none ol
them recognized as president of
Mexico.
Verdun.
Verdun is the last of the great for
tresses with which France has sought
to defend Its northern frontier.
There, in 843, Charles, Louis and
Lotbaire, the sons of Louis I, “the deb
onair,” divided the empire of Charle
magne, brought France and Germany
into existence and began the modem
map of Europe.
Awarded to Germany then, It came
back to Franco under Henry 11 In
1652.
From that day, the Junction of the
road that runs down the Meuse to Bel
gium and the road that goes straight
from Metz to France, has been a great
fortress. A Benedictine abbey was de
stroyed to put a royal keep on its foun
dations. Around it is an encircling
ring of forts.
Its plateau rises a steep 400 feet
above the valley of the Meuse on the
west, and on the east has a short pitch
pf 200 feet above the plain.
Pure Accident.
When David R. Francis, recently
appointed ambassador to Russia by
President Wilson, was governor of
Missouri, he was mightily Interested
in the negro population of Jefferson
City, the state capital. He knew much
of what there was to know about the
colored man, having been born "and
raised” in Kentucky himself, and had
a number of good stories about an old
darky whom he called Hot Foot, be
cause he was so deliberate. Hot Foot
had a stereotyped reply to the gov
ernor’s morning salutation.
“Good morning, Hot Foot,” the gov
ernor would say. "How are you to
day?”
“Sober by chance, boss, sober by
chance.”
And the governor never failed to
laugh.
Pupils to Investigate Industries.
As part of the regular school cur
riculum seniors in the high school of
Knoxville, Tenn., are to make a syste

mum and minimum wages, chances
for promotion and any other Informa
tion that will serve to throw light on
the character of the specific vocation.
A study of the social, civic and eco
nomic conditions of the city will also
