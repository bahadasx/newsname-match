Bitter Debate in Committee Behind
Closed Doors Over Anti-Catholic
Platform Plank.

J. FRANK HAXLY.
ST. PAUL, July 20.?When the
national prohibition convention
opened today at 9:45 a.m., the
Hanly managers predicted his
nomination for President on the
first ballot
The report of the committee
on credentials was adopted without
objection. This report
showed 727 delegates and thirtysix
alternates on the floor of the
convention. Thirtv-nine states
.. -t-ii
and the District of Columbia
were represented. There were
ten complete state delegations.
An effort to inject an antiCatholic
declaration into the prohibition
platform caused the
resolutions committee to go into
executive session, in which a bitter
debate was waged.
Former Gov, Sulzer of New York
arrived shortly before 11 o'clock and went
into consultation with a number ?of
friends.
Will Address the Convention.
Whether Sulzer by a last-hour apn#apflnr?
hi>fnr? tbp eonventiAn
rally enough delegates to his support
to defeat Hanlv of Indiana was the
question that predominated virtually
every discussion before the convention
was called to order this morning.
With prospects that nominations would
be made late this afternoon, supporters
of Sulzer eagerly waited his arrival. His
confidential secr< try, Charles J. Haaga,
arrived last night and arranged with
National Chairman Hinshaw for Sulzer's
Introduction from the platform immediately
upon his arrival at the auditorium.
Definite action on the resolutions
committee's report probably will be
taken before names are presented for
the presidential nomination. Mr. Hanly's
name will be presented by Sumner
Havnes of Portland. Ind.. after Alabama
has yielded to Indiana, according
to the program of his supporters as
announced by Alonzo K. Wilson of Chicago,
chairman of the Hanly steering
committee.
Daniel Pohllng of Boston will make
the seconding speech for Hanly after
Sulzer's name has been placed in nomination
by Eugene W. Chafln of Arisona,
the second on the roll, of states.
Dr. Ira Landrith of Nashville, Ter.n ,
will be presented by the Hanley forces
for the vice presidential nomination,
according to Mr. Wilson.
In Uproar for Ten Minutes.
Efforts to adopt the resolutions committee's
draft of a platform without
first printing and distributing copies to
delegates precipitated the first lively
outbreak of contention among delegates
at the convention.
The advocates of immediate adoptiof
of the proposed platform receded from
their position under the pressure of opposition
from the floor. William Shaw
of Boston, who headed the effort to expedite
consiueration of the platform,
withdrew his motion to debate without
printing and the convention took a recess
until 2 p.m.
For ten minutes the convention was
in an uproar, delegates standing on
chairs and shouting wildly, while
Chairman Patton vainly attempted to
restore order.
The majority of the delegates evidently
desired to have deliberate dis
cues ion of the planks in the proposed
platform before taking: ud the question
of adoption.
The mtTch-heralded appearance ol
former Gov. Sulzer of New York before
the convention as an aspirant for
the prohibition presidential nomination
did not materialize. Mr. Sulzer arrived
in St Paul and went to a hotel
where he consulted friends.
He said he did riot come to St. Paul
to seek nomination, but because s
group of friends in the convention
begged him to come and speak 'for the
good of the cause." "I am willing, however.
to lead if they want to follow
me," he added.
Whether Mr. Sulxer is to speak at th?
Lconvention is to he determined after
h conference with Eugene Chaftn ol

ASHEVILLE, N. C.( July 20.
?The list of deaths from Sunday's
flood in five southeastern
states, which has been constantly
growing as channels of communication
were restored, stood
it eighty-three today, with nine
oersons still reported missing.
Most of the deaths have been in

Property loss also has heen heavy,
great damage being done to railroads,
industrial plants and agricultural Interests.
This has been confined to a
great extent to the Carolinas, but
adjacent portions of Tennessee, Virginia
and West Virginia also suffered.
It was thought Tuesday that $15,000,000
would cover all property loss, and in
inly a few instances have damage esimates
been lowered as rivers returned
to normal. The section directly
iround Asheville, including* the Vanlerbilt
estate and the village of Biltnore,
was one of the exceptions. Loss
was overestimated there, it was said. }
md it now is believed that the total 1
iamage to property in this section will 1
lot exceed $1,500,000. ,
Caring for Flood Sufferers. \

Rocky Broad Valley Damage. J
A description of the scene in the Rocky
3road valley, when parts of Chimney
tock and Hat Cave were swept away,
vas given to a newspaper man at Henlersonville
by Dr. L. B. Morse, a resident
>f that place, who returned there from
'himney Rock, where he spent the Sunlay
of the flood.
I>r. Morse, who, with his brother, built
he $25,000 scenic highway 10 the foot of 1
'himney Rock, said the greater part of
he roadway had been destroyed and some
en or twelve houses in Chimney Rock
vashed away, but that the two tourist
lotels near there, the Ksmeralda inn
md Mountain View Inn, were not inured
to any great extent. Two men,
dr. Morse said, were swept away while
>n the highway, hut he did not learri their
james. They probably were included in
he list already given out.
There has been much suffering in the
3at Cave section from lack of food. Dr.
dorse said, adding that he saw flood survivors
who had nothing to eat except
>arched corn. "And they were glad to
?et that," he added. He doubted if supdies
had yet reached them.
"This disaster," said Dr. Morse,
'which has wiped out a part of a once
smiling countryside, was so sudden.
<o startling, that words are powerless
o convey one's impressions. I shall
never forget the horrors of that Saturday
night and Sunday morning. The
extent of sjicii a catastrophe in so "
narrow a gorge, where the waters rose
not by inches, but by feet at a time,
with the grinding force of great bowllers.
swept along like bubbles, cannot
he estimated until the waters have returned
to their natural channels.
Caught Full Fury of Flood.
"Bat Cave seems to have caught the
full fury of the flood which came down
the gorge from Chimney Rock, but the
latter place suffered more than it can
recover from in a long time."
Dr. Morse said that lie saw supplies
forwarded from Hendersonville being
transferred from wagon to wagon
across the bridgeless streams between
Hondersonviile and Bat Cave.
"The people made homeless by the I
floods." he said, "have found shelter in
the houses of more fortunate neighbors.
but the need for food is pressing."
Chimney Rock, situated in the Hickory
Nut gap a mile and a half from Bat
'ave. and, like the lifter place, having
no railroad connection with the outside
world, is a village of about thirty
Homes with not more than 150 people.
I'here are two tourists' hotels and five
?r six boarding houses, it derives its
name from the mountain. 2,000 feet
High, which is pinnacled by a chimneyshaped
rock, reached by the scenic
highway recently constructed and now
l>artially destroyed. The mountain is
me of western North Carolina's attractions.
The Asheville-Charlotte automotile
highway, completed last summer
tnd which has been seriously damaged
in many places by the flood, runs
through the village.

The tracks were repaired and the seven

twenty-five persons, who had remained

[t is said that the Wilcox county ofIcials,
however, will appeal to the government
and ask for a part of the appropriation

STORM IS MOVING NORTH.
Now 200 Miles Off Coast and East
of Cape Hatteras.
The tropical storm making its way
ip the Atlantic coast from the West
Indies apparently was centered this
morning 200 miles off the North Caroina
coast, about east of Cape Hatteras.
^"ery little information had reached the
weather bureau early today concerning
its intensity. The only reports came
by radio from ships at sea in the vicintv
of the storm.
Latest dispatches told of winds with
i velocity of sixty-four miles an hour,
but these were from the edges of the
listurbance. They indicated that the
storm was moving slowly northward.
Fresh gales and strong northeast
winds prevailed on the coast today
from North Carolina to the Delaware
breakwater. Storm warnings were ordered
to continue at all stations from
Hatteras to Boston, except at Baltimore.

Stile paralysis "
case from new york
Little Five-year-old Girl, 111, Was
Taken to Colonial Beach, and
Is Now Back, Nearly Well.
Washington's fifth Infantile paralysis
case since the outbreak of the New
York epidemic, and the first one to be
traced directly to the metropolis, was i
reported to the health department this
afternoon.
The patient, a five-year-old girl, is
at 823 16th street. According to the
physician in charge, the case is of
mild type.
Information given to the health department
is to the effect that the child
developed illness in New York, and was
taken to Colonial Beach June 26, subsequently
coming to Washington from
the river resort July 2. It was stated
that report of the disease would have
been made sooner, but for the fact that |
it was not recognized as infantile paralysis.
Believed to Be Genuine Case.
Dr. William C. Fowler, head of the
contagious disease service, will visit
the patient this afternoon. From the
description that has been given him
he is convinced that it is a genuine
case.
It is said that the child's temperature
j has been normal for thirteen days. In
j view of the fact that the District regu
lations do not require the quarantining
of an infantile paralysis patient
longer than two weeks after a return
of the temperature to normal, it is possible
that further isolation may not be
considered necessary.
The health department today was
trying to run down a report that a
child suffering with infantile paralysis
had been carried to a drug store in the J
northwest section of the city, with the
result that several persons were exposed
to infection. Officials of the department
were inclined to discredit the report,
saying that it would be difficult
even for an experienced physician to
tell from a superficial examination as
to. whether or not a child was afflicted
with infantile paralysis or some other
form of paralysis. I
Believed to Be Wild Rumor. j
The department regarded, the rumor
as one of the many unfortunate scares { ,
that are likely to result from the pres- I
ent situation. They will endeavor to
ascertain the facts in the case, though
this will be difficult, as the name of
the person in charge of the child is
not known.
With cases now on record, the
health department today again called
attention to the importance of citi- ,
,_i? <n their nower to Dlace
zens noma ? ? - .
the city in a sanitary condition This,
coupled with a vigorous war on the
house fly will, in their opinion, accomplish
a great deal toward warding off
an epidemic of the scourge.
DEATH OF IRISH REBEL
WILL BE INVESTIGATED
LONDON. July 20, 4:10 p.m.?In the
house of commons today Premier Asquith
promised that as soon as arrangements
could be made a public
inquiry would be held into the death
of F. Sheehy Skefflrigton of Dublin,
editor of the Irish Citizen, who, at the
time of the Irish rebellion, was put to
death by a British officer without the
knowledge of ypp military authorities.

BY N. O. MESSENGER.
NEW YORK, July 20.?Inside
:stimates of republicans leaders
icre figure that 90 per cent of the 1
irogrcssives who bolted the reguar
republican party in 1912 are <
lack in the fold, and will support
lugbes and Fairbanks at the
lolls in November.
"And most of them were back when
he republican convention acted In
.'hicago," says former Senator Hemenray
of Indiana, who is a member of
he campaign committee of the naional
committee. This opinion Is 1
hared by former Senator W. Murray j
!rane. who. while not a member of the
ommittee, is a very potent personality T
n republican higher councils. 1
The republican leadership is con- '
inced that the dissenting bull moosers
re more noisy than numerous and <
hat their protests will gradually
diminish as the campaign progresses j
nd the futility of effective opposition
lecomes apparent. Some of them will
ro to Wilson, but their loss will be
rritten off as "wear and tear" of the i
'Olitical plant.
Candidate Hughes continues to make 1
t plain to the complaining regulars
hat he has no sympathy with their 1
ear that the progressives are being
riven too much recognition in the 1
tarty and that he intends to make
io distinction between flesh and fowl
rhen it comes to dealing with regulars
.nd progressives.
Beveridge Back in Fold. J
Former Senator Beveridge, sometime *
m enthusiastic bull mooser, came ;
>ack in the reservation last night and
rave up his gun in exchange for a new
ilanlcet and a place in the sun with a
veil filled pipe of peace to smoke. His .
eturn was literally a fatted calf repeition,
as he was entertained at dinner <
>y Mr. Hughes, and everybody was
lappy.
Republican headquarters took on an
lir of liveliness today with the as- ;embling
of the campaign committee
md the presence of a number of re>ublicans
who might be classed as "of ,
;ounsel." They were stepping high,
vith heads up, and there was no mis- ^
aking the atmosphere of confidence and
:nthusiasm which they radiated. J
The special committee of five senaors
having charge of the campaign for
rnited states senatorships was on
land and immediately went into ses- .
;ion. Those present were Senators
A'eeks, Smoot, Curtis, Sterling and i
?Vadsworth.
They were joined by Fred Hale of 1
daine, who is a candidate for the senitorship
against Senator Johnson. Mr.
dale brought details of the situation 4
n that state and the committee spent
nore than an hour going over them j
vith him.
The special committee is thoroughly |
mpressed with the prime necessity as

lections and will strain every nerve

to that end.

Cornelius N. Bliss, treasurer of the
lational committee, and Fred Upham '
f Chicago, western "hat-passer" of the *
ommittee, were present and wore '
miles that argued well for a week's 1
ffort at passing the hat. *
By request of Chairman Willcox, c
tembers of the republican national (

Vashington came over to attend the

LONDON, July 20.?The
French have resumed their driving
offensive along the Somme,
n northern France, forcing back
the Germans on a wide front
:>oth north and south of the river.

Further ground in Delville wood
ind Longueval. The British last
light reported the recapture at
these points of most of the ground
taken by the Germans Tuesday
light.
According to this afternoon's
Paris bulletin the German first'ine
trenches from Barleux to
Soyecourt, south of the Somtne,
i distance of five miles, fell into
French hands.
North of the river the French
attack pushed east from Hardecourt,
and carried trenches along
the Combles-Clery railway. The
operations here are close to the
right flank of the British advance,
Combles itself being little more
than, three miles southeast of
Longueval.
The French push forward at
Soyecourt marks the farthest
southward point carried by them
n their offensive.
North of the Longueval-Bazentin
position the British pushed
Forward their line. East of the
Leipsic redoubt bombing parties
nade a substantial advance dur
ng the night.
Wood Deemed Vital Point.
What the Trones wood was after the
irst big advance by the British, the
Delville wood promises to become after
:he second, the Germans considering it
squally vital to their present line of de'ense.
South Africans, including both
British and Boers, took it most galantly
after the British broke the sec>nd
line of defenses last week, but were
>ver-brave, eager and inexperienced in
his kind of warfare.
In the last twenty-four hours the
Germans have been massing troops and
leveloping counter attacks with the i
esult that something of the same kind '
>f see-sawing as at Trones wood has
aken place among the fallen trees,
>ranches ^undergrowth and shell cr*aers.
The Germans threw a division at the
South Africans Tuesday night, aiming
o recover both Delville wood and the
illage of Longueval, with the result
hat the South Africans, who insisted
hat they could hold the wood without
lelp, were outnumbered and had to
five ground. The Germans got possession
of little more than half of the
rood and some houses of the village
ilong the side of the wood. British renforcements
coming up soon checked
he attack. #
