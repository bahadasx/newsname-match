R. M. Painter Writes of His
Trip
I left Meade on No. 2 and
stopped off at Greensborg, tak
ing the evening plug for Hutch
inson; leaving there in a few min
utes for Wichita on tbe Interur
ban, where we remained .until
tbe afternoon of Tuesday the
1 1 th. Took tbe Frisco for Aug
usta, the new oil fields of Kan
sas. Everyone is wild over the
strikes, that are being made ev
ery day and the stories you hear
remind one of the early days of
Leadville and other mining dis
tricts of Colorado. All the way
from Augusta to Douglas oil
derricks were in evidence and
everyone on trains or in the
towns talks oil, and I am sure
dream of oil when they go to
sleep, if they ever do. It is so
warm that sleep is hard to ob
tain and after you have threshed
about for hours trying to get a
few moments of needed sleep,
one who has bad an experience
with the delightful nights in
good old Meade county, longs to
return to tbe best place to sleep
in this bully state.
At Douglas we spoke to a large
and appreciative audience at
tbeir reunion, on the 12th, leav
ing over tbe Santa Fe via Win
field, to Howard, Elk county,
where we were met by a delega
tion of friends, and our two
daughters. In the afternoon we
were greeted in their new high
school auditorium by a splehdid
crowd, and after our address a
splendid ovalion by tbe old com
rades, the ladies of the W. R. C.
and tbe ladies of tbe G. A. R.,
meeting many old friends and
making many new ones.
After spending the night with
the children we again boarded
tbe train for Tope k a leaving out
several places we expected to
visit until it became cooler more
endurable arriving at home ati
one o'clock p. m. finding every
one sweltering with beat. 1 We
found all sections of the country
suffering with, heat and needing
rain. Corn must have rain soon
or it will be ruined I find no
place that looks better to me than
M ade County, none that can
show better bouses and barns

Tractor Accident
Ed Wagner, a tractor engineer
met with a serious accident last
Thursday. He bad been plow
tng on tbe farm of John Wthrle,
six miles north of Meade. At a'
few minutes before seven o'clock
he stopped bis tractor for the
night, and while adjusting some
part of the machinery, tbe sleeve
of bis jumper in some manner
became entangled in the fly
wheel. He was thrown to the
ground, and rendered uncon
scious, an ugly gash tut in his
head, and bis arm bably bruised.
Upon regaining consciousness,
injured as be was, be got on bis
motor cycle and went to v the
home of Ed. Shaw, a mile away.
Medical aid was at once sum
moned, and at this time fcje is up
and about.
Mrs. John Cunningham,' of
Caney, Kansas, is a guest at tbe
home of Mr. and Mrs. W. F.
Casteen.
Mrs. M. R. White and little
son returned Thusday to their
home in Bronaugb, Missouri, af
ter a two week's stay with Mrs.
White'
s brother, R. F. Todd.
and no county in my travels with
such large wheat .fields as I see
in the southwest.;' "The dark
green foliage on tbe' timber, that
skirts the streams is - the only
charming thing to attract my at
tention. I have seen, no fair
grounds to compare with ours at
Meade, none so clean with such
a splendid track.. Most of tbe
race tracks are grown op with
we mIs, they need Tom Johnston
and bis push hoe. If oar farm
ers and stock raisers would get
a move on themselves we could
have a fair that would make this
stoney oil producing country look
like coppers in a lot of stacks of
twenty dollar gold pieces. We
have better horses, better cat
tic, better wheat, better alfalfa,
better looking women and babies
and just as good people as live
on eartb. If we could only in
duce tbe good people of Meade
to get a hustle on themselves we
could prove this statement to an
absolute certainty.
