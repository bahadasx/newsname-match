OCJILA'S BUDGET
FDD 0OT !Ei
Some Interesting Figures for the Tax
payers of the City
to Consider
Henry C. Sistrunk. city clerk, has
prepared his budget estimate of , the
fiscal year of 1916-17, and council will
begin consideration of the same at its
next regular meeting. . According to
Mr. Sistrunk's estimate it will be nec
essary next year to levy a tax of 13
mills, as against 8 mills levied this
year, and in this connection . the city
clerk says: "The councif may consider
it wise not to levy a millage for re
retiring the electric light and water
works bonds, looking forward to the
improvement of these plants when
there will no doubt be a profit suffi
cient that' could be set aside for the
retirement of these bonds. This is
the only way whereby a reduction in
the millage can be arrived at." Should
council decide to use the profit of the
plant,. Mr. Sistrunk -is of the opinion
that the millage ,might be reduced
from 13 miys to 11 mills. ,
The total valuation of property in
the city, according to the 1916 assess
ment amounts to $4,215,290, and to
take care of the general fund of the
city will require a levy of six mills,
that would raise $25,279.74. It will
be necessary, according to the esti
mate, to have a millage of 3 mills
to take care of sinking fund for gen
eral bonds, water works bonds, sewer
bonds and electric light ; bonds. :i It
will be necessary to have a ZM mills
levy to cover the bond interest, M-mill
for public library fund, -mill for
rest room fund. , .
The total expenses of the general
fund for 1915 amounted to $53,567,
and the estimated general fund ex
pense for 1916-17 is $38,605.35. The
estimated, reecipts for the 1916-17
general fund amount to $13,525.61.
Making the amouht to be raised by
taxation for the general fund $25,
279.74. :y'
The sinking fund . for J the general
bonds is $2,500, interest $1,000; for
water works bond $5,000 and $5,000
respectively; for sewer bonds $3,500
and $5,000; for electric light bonds
$2,500 and $3,750. :
ARGUMENTS FOR AND
AGAINST INJUNCTION
Arguments in the case of the in
junction to restrain the city from pay
ing out funds to Benjamin Thompson,
of Tampa, contractor for the combin
ed light and water , plant, were be
gun this morning before Judge W. S.
Bullock in chambers; Richard McCon-
athy and H. M. Hampton represent
ing the complaintants, and Frederick
Hocker, city attprney, representing
the city. . The arguments are being
continued this afternoon, and when
completed, Judge .Bullock will take
the application for the injunction un
der advisement, and reach a decision
as soon as possible, probably not be
fore several days.
The city's answer as prepared by
the city attorney was read before the
council yesterday afternoon, and was
sworn to and signed. .

SOME FIGURES ON
GOOD ROADS BUILDING
The committee named at the meet
ing of good roads enthusiasts Monday
night, to prepare a circular letter and
statement outlining the proposed plan
or issuing $900,000 in bonds to give
Marion county permanent highways,
has completed its work, and the letter
and statement will be sent out as soon
as possible to the various precincts.
he members of the committee are W.
D Cam, David S. Welch and E. IL
Osborne. The information will be
sent out in order that the precincts
will have something definite to guide
them in their selection of delegates to
the convention to be held in Ocala on
August 7 for the purpose of ascer
taining the sentiment of the people
with regard to the proposed bond is
sue.'-- x
The committee's letter follows:
d the Voters of Marion County:
We are spending $70,000 every year
for up keep of our present hard
roads and paying interest and liquid
ating our present indebtedness.
As you are aware there is a move
ment on foot to bond the county for
he purpose of building permanent
roads. We find that 5 bonds to the
amount of $900,000 will retire the
outstanding indebtedness and build
about 200 miles of sand-asphalt road,
which with small maintainance will
ast indefinitely.
The bonds will take up the $110,000
warrants at 1 less than we are now
aying. .
We inclose a statement showing
amount of bondl" to be issued each
year with interest thereon and sink
ing fund carefully worked out, which
we think can not be disputed, show
ing that $900,000 of thirty year bonds
can be issued; that these bbnd3 will be
paid off in thirty years with all in
terest at the same or less than the
present millage and at the same time
have a maintainance fund ample to
keep all roads in good repair and carry
on general road work throughout the
county. We urge you to study this
table carefully and make your own
calculations. .;
In making this table we have figur
ed that the property of the county
will increase each five years 15 per
cent, or at the rate of three per cent
per year. v We do not thmk that this
. - . . - mm
is as mucit as it will actually increase,
but certainly think we are safe in this
;timate.
During the past ten years the rec
ords of the tax assessor's office show
an average increase of 3 per year.;
ven without better roads we may
expect thi3 increase in valuation, but
with permanent roads and the addi
tions to our population we believe it
will be double this amount and only!
increase is a very low estimate. S
The following roads have been sug
gested and seem to meet general ap-

Heard National Bank Offers Induee
ments to Farmers to Increase
the Yield
The Heard National Bank of Jack
sonville is offering prizes for the best
bushel of corn grown by a Florida
farmer. The prizes are $100 for first,
$75 for second, and $50 for third.
These prizes are high enough to make
it worth while to compete and we want
Marion county to be represented.
There should be a full bushel of ear
corn, and each individual ear should
be cleaned, shucked and wrapped with
paper and tied with a string. Your
local bank will take care of the for
warding and you can get full informa
tion by applying to your banker. The
judging will probably occur in Novem
ber and the exhibit should be for
warded as soon as the corn is dry.
There will be many exhibits doubt
lessly and the great amount of, corn
exhibited will enable the agricultural
staff of the university and experiment
station, to get a much better line on
the different types grown, in the state
and help them in their work. This
great exhibit of Florida's best corn
will help put the corn raising quali
ties of this state before the country
and not only bring new settlers here
but also awaken those already here to
greater efforts.
Marion county certainly wants to be
well represented in this corn show
and many exhibits of the best com
which the county produces this year
should be sent. Just remember that
we must not be found wanting When
the exhibit is closed. Marion county'
must try to hold up her reputation
and get the prize. It is up to the
farmers to show the visitor to Jack
sonville that this is the county where
the best corn can be grown.
