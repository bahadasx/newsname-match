GLASS will break. Perhaps
some ''day iripy'Il invent a
nonureakalilo glass, and then you
won't have to bother when the
small boy throws stones. Hut
until that glad day arrives we
arc in the business of furnishing
glass. We cut to measure. Putty,
of course. A lot of other things
break besides glass. That's why
we carry tools to mend with and
najls and glue and what not to
repair with. A good, reliable
