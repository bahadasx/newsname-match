The roar of guns la continuous and
resembles the heavy roll of thunder.
The Germans are replying only occas
ionally. Either they are seriously
out-gunned^ or ar© saving their am
munition.
British aircraft, without molesta
tion, are directing the lire of the ar
tillery. Since the beginning of the
Anglo-French push, German air craft
have been surprisingly absent. Allied
flyers and balloon observers have
been, working in perfect security, ob
taining most valuable Information.
Ffcom a height a short distance In
the rear, I obtained an excellnt view
of Frlcourt, Contalmaison, Mametz
village, Mametz wood, Bazentin-Le
Grand and other positions recently
conquered by the British. Later our
party traversed tho valley of the Som
me and entered the ruins of Fricourt,
once a German stronghold, but storm
ed and captured by the British early
in their great offensive.
Imagine a giant steam roller pass

thousand inhabitants and ypu get an
idea of Frlcourt today. The little
French town hag been literally wiped
off the map. The German dug out
and shell holes represent the spiko
Holes of a huge steam roller. The
rest of the town is flattened in debris.
Here and there from the hole of &
battered in German dug out comes a
sickening stench that tells of piles of
corpses. The scene at Fricourt is
typical of that in any of the other vil
lages blotted out by high explosives.
High British officers say that the
purpose of the British offensive is not
speed but to recover by slow, steady
pushes every yard of Invaded Frecnh

expense of human blood and by heavy
expense of powerful explosives, of
which there Is an ample supply. Flght-

PARIS, July 20.—French troops
resumed their offensive on both sides
of the river Somme last night, with
successful drives against the German
lines both northwest and southwest
of Peronne, It was officially an
nounced today.
North of the Somme, French In
fantry established new lines along
the Combles-Clery narrow gauge rail
way, taking 400 prisoners. South of
the Somme, French troops .stormed
and captured the entire first line
trencb between Barleux and Soye
court.
The advance north of the Somme,
further straightened the French line
to conform to the recent British ad
vance. The attack south of the
Somme was another gain In the cam

bend, of the Somme.
On the Verdun front, the French
scored a notable success In last
night's fighting, capturing a strongly
fortified German work south of
Fleury, northeast of Verdun and tak

CHICAGO, July 20.—Chicago pack
ers today furnished new proof that
Uncle Sam's soldier boys are not
only the best fed soldiers in the
world on the firing line, but also at
home. When the United States
trooper marches away to do military
duty, he gets just as much meat to
eat as he got at home—but no more.
This was the answer packers gave
today when asked if any more meat
was being consumed and if the price
was any higher now than before the
government ordered militia mobiliza
tion and began baying large quanti
ties of meats.

The American—soldier or civilian—
demands his meat and gets it," one
Chicago packer said.
"This isn't true of the European
soldier. Most of them do not have
meat at home. It is an army luxury
and consequently when European
powers mobilized millions of nv.n

price went up. Our soldier, the best
fed in the world, is getting his usual

Prohibition National Conven
tion Almost Paralyzed at
Generosity of Flor-
MiMaa.7i^:.
CARRIED TO PLATFORM
John P. Coffin, Little Old Man In
a Back Seat, is the Hero
of the Meet
ing.
[By H. 1. Rennlck, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
ST. PAUL, Minn., July 20.—The
prohibition national convention Is go
ing to nominate some one—likely J.
Frank Hanley, of Indiana—for presi
dent today, but a little old man from
Johnston, fciorlda, is
itB
hero.
This little old man sat pretty far
back in the convention hall today and
talked to his gray-haired motherly
looking little wife, who shared the
honors.
They were Mr. and Mrs. John P.
Coffin, who own 1,200 acres of land
down in Florida, but act and look just
like the rest of the "home folks'* who
are attending the convention.
This was all they did:
The prohibitionists need money to
run a campaign. The chairman had
called for contributions and they were
coming in Blowly. A voice back in
the hall said something about $50,
000.
"What's that?" the crowd shouted.
Coffin's gray head popped up from
the Florida delegation.
"Yes, that's what said," he said.
"Put me down for $50,000."
The convention cheered and dele
gates toppled over their chairs to get
to Coffin. They picked him up and
carried him to the platform. Mrs.
Coffin looked embarrassed, but they
picked her up, too, and carried her up
there with him.
Doffin's contribution is believed the
.largest ever made for a prohibition
campaign. His pledge started the ball
rolling and funds rolled in after that.
The collection was just like one of
those donation parties they have for
country ministers. Those who didn't
have money, gave other things. One
man tossed into the pot a mortgage
for $158.68 on some Illinois law books
and told the collectors to get after
the money.
The old fashioned camp meeting
style of a convention was to see some
"steam rollering" today. The faction
backing Hanly for president had con
trol and planned to nominate him,
adopt a platform and adjourn tonight,
one lav in advance of tbe scheduled
time. To check the steam roller. Wil
liam Sulzer, former governor of New
York, the other candidate for presi
dent, was expected here today to at
tempt a stampede for himself.
Out of a mass of suggestions placed
before them by enthusiast on almost
every subject under the sun, the con
ventions platform committee early
today had fairly well worked out its
principal planks. The Susan B. An

DASH FOR THE CAPES
Plans Are Hidden In a Mystery
Deeper and Darker Than
the Mud Beneath
Her.
[By Carl D. Groat. United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
BALTIMORE, Md., July 20—Dawn
today found the German sub-sea
freighter Deutschland still docked
here, flanked by obscuring barges and
the protecting tug Timmins. Maneu
vers before daylight led to the belief
that she intended to make a dash for
the capes, but what her plans now
may be, is hidden in a mystery
deeper and darker than tbe mud be
neath her.
A run for the capes before or after
night fall, seems logical and probable.
During the night, tbe Deutschland's
hatches were fastened and her fore
and, aft masts telescoped, BO that only
her periscope showed.
This with the extra precautions by
patrol launches and the searchlight
operators on the Thiamins gave rise
ito the impression thut at last the
giant undersea freighter intended
starting homeward.
In the moonlight, the submarine
lay like a giant green fish. Now and
again the Timmins .puifed close to
her, jealously guarding her against
the curious. Finally at a. m., she
opened a line in tbe barges and
maneuvered for a few minutes and
seemed ready for a dash. It failed
to materialize. The cordon was
closed again and tihe mystery was
more mysterious than ever.
Captain Hinch, transportation mas
ter for the new freighters, Is whisper
ing to his friends that the Bremen
will dock here by Saturday. Cer
tainly everything points that way—
and to the departure of the Deutsch
land either simultaneously or earlier.
Members of the crew scoffed at
published reports that they feared
the return journey through capture
In allied submarine nets.

She will go to Brooklyn, N. Y., as

A PROBLEM TO SOLVE
America Does Not Take Care of tha
Family Left Behind VWian
War Comes
On.
tBy William G. Shepherd, United
press Staff Correspondent.]
SAJN ANTONIO, Texas, July 20.—
Not one soldier that I rubbed elbows
with in all the armies of Europe in
the past two years ever worried as
some of these American soldiers along
the edge of Mexico.
These Americans I refer to aro.
worrying about their families back,
home they don't know whether their
wives and children have enough to
eat. Such a deplorable situation
could not possibly exist In any Eu
ropean army, for European govern
ments care for the famiUes of their...
soldiers.
The Mexican government does not
we don't.
Tve talked with hundreds of sol
diers of six different armies in Eu
rope. I talked today with my first
soldier of the new American armies.
I talked to Europeans in artillery pits,
trenches and dug-outs, but I talked
with the American in a Jitney going
from San Antonio to th% army post.
If the Germans knew Britishers
were treating the families of their sol
diers as we are treating ours, or vice
versa, the fact would be blazoned
world wide as an indication of govern
mental cruelty by the enemy. It's not
cruelty on our part, only oversight,
and the lesson we've learned has cost
unhappiness and embarrassment in
many American homes.
If an American correspondent
learned from a British Boldier what 1
learned from Frank Shepkowskl, my
•first American soldier, today, he wouldi
•break the British censorship to get
the story to the world. Shepkowslti,
of Company H, Second Blinois infan
try, will march up the Bteps of his
little home at 1452, Emma street.
North Chicago within a couple of
days, give his wife a hug and say,
"well, I'm home." He's got a check
from Uncle Sam for $07.72 and if he's
careful after paying his fare he ought
to have about $20 to hand over- to
Mrs. Shepowski. He was born in
Poland but has served In the militia
six years and his term of enlistment
expired today, his militia career wind
ing up with a blazing two week's holi
day here in Texas.
It was from Shepowski that I got
my first inkling that thousands of
Americans here who were snatched
suddenly from their families In the
little breeze of war which struck Am
erica three weeks ago, are worrying
about folks back home and wondering
