QUIET ON WESTERN FRONT
Germans Use New Asphyxiat
ing Shell in Bloody Con
flict With British.
London, July 10. While the ad
verse weather is compelling a lull in
the fighting on the western front,
military critics are taking stock of the
situation. They are agreeably sur
prised by the large captures of heavy
armament that Gen. Sir Douglas Haig,
the British commander-in-chief, an
nounced. The critics point out how the Brit
ish attacks have benn pressed with
tho greatest rapidity and give the
Germans no time to organize formid
able defenses. Also, as was evidenced
by tho withdrawal of the British from
the Foureaux wood, where they had
reached the German third line, Gen.
Haig wisely resisted the temptation to
hold on to that point. It would have
incurred severe fighting, with prob
ably heavy losses, and Gen. Haig was
in favor of a more methodical ad
vance. Evidence received from the front,
as well as the official map published
here, seems to prove that the German
second line of defenses was far less
strong and elaborate than the first
Therefore, the military observers be
lieve that the obstacles are likely to
be less difficult as the entente allies
advance.
With regard to the east front Gen,
von Lirisingen's retirement across the
Lipa is considered by the critics as
removing the last serious obstacle to
the advance of the .Russians toward
Lemberg.
There was little fresh news from
either front today. Gen. Haig was
able to report substantial progress
north of Oviliers while the Germans
utilized the lull in making an attempt
to retrain lost eround at Biaches and
Li Maisonnette. Fighting in this re
gion continues.
Reports from Rome say that the re
tirement of the Teutonic allies on the
Lipa has caused a panic in Galicia,
where towns are being evacuated.
BLOODY FIGHT AT LONGUEVAL.
With the exception of the region of
Longueval and south of the Somme at
Biaches, relative calm prevailed on
the fighting front in France.
The British and Germans are en
gaged in a sanguinary conflict in the
region of Longueval 'salient to the
northwest of Combles. With the
clearing of the weather, the Germans

BERLIN ZOO HIT
BY A FAMINE
Food Too Scarce to Be Fed
Animals Too
Freely.
Berlin, July 19. The sight of 10
absolutely meatless weeks which, ac
cording to the food dictator, Herr
Batocki, are hanging over our heads
like a sword of Damocles have not
yet come, nor yet have we been re
duced to the same straits as were the
people of Paris during the siege of
1871, when they were compelled to
cat all the inmates of the Paris zoo.
But if the authorities do not very soon
make up their minds to have the ani
mals in the Berlin Zoological Garden
slaughtered we shall find very little
meat on any of them at tho time when
it might become necessary to send
them to abbatoirs.
In the Berlin zoo the sufferings of
' the poor beasts are obvious Their
' constant roars and howls leave no
doubt as to their feelings towards the
. wardens. More disreputable looking
' creatures than the birds which are tho
national symbols of Germany as well
lo theso beasts, My dcar ncrr
Lion or Herr Tigor.wc ourselves have
j for some tim0 beenforced to get along
with sevcrai meatless days a week,
an(j js therefore, no more than right
that you should do tho same. On these
days, therefore, you will in the future
get only a sour herring or a few pota-
to peelings.

Mexico City, July 19. James Lynn

can secretary of war that the Ameri
can expeditionary forces in Mexico
would be gradually withdrawn from
Mexican territory. Mexican commis
sioners have been designated to

DOUBLE KILLING.
Dawson, Ky., July 19. K. H.
Keach, Marshal of Dawson, this after
noon shot and killed Dick Rogers and
was in turn shot and killed by Mack
Logan, who was with Rogers.
Keach and Rogers had had trouble
before.
instead of their usual weekly meal,
which has always consisted of a fat
rabbit. Animals stand a radical change
of diet far less readily than human be
ings, and during our recent walks
through the zoo we have noticed that
the lions and tigers are looking any
thing but happy. Iheir Hanks are
hollow and their ribs protrude.
The elephants are melancholy and
are trying in vain to understand why
none of the visitors who used to spoil
them with buns and cakes now never
go near them and why those who do
stop to look at them never give them
any food.
"Five ostriches have diet! and of
the 11 giant snakes there are now on
ly three left and these look anything
but alive. Nearly all the inmates of
the aquarium have died."
COUNTY BOOKS
ALL BALANCE
Assistant Inspector Corley
Accepts Work; Records
Checked Up.
F. G. Corley, assistant state inspec
tor, has carefully checked up all tho
books in the offices of the county
olnrk. rnuntv iudrro and circuit clerk
! since 1909 and finds that all balance.
j He has given his certificate of approv-
nl to all the present officers and writ-
ten 'the acceptance of the state dc-
partroent across the books.
In the case of Walter Radford,
former circuit clerk, it was found that
Mr. Radford had overpaid about $2.
Mr. Corley finished up his work Mon
day. The officers who wore checked up
were former County Clerk R. T.
Stowe and the present County Clerk
L. J. Harris, former Circuit Clerk
Walter Radford and the present Clerk
C. R. Clark, and County Judge Wal
ter Knight.
Two Cars Jump Track.
Two cars of No. 79 freight train on
tho L. & N. railroad ran off tho track
at McMaha switch, about one mile
south of town, this morning at about
4 o'clock. A wrecker was telegraph
ed for at Earlington but the trainmen
succeeded in getting tho cars back on
the switch before the wrecker got on
its journey bearing aid. One of the
cars was full of mules but none were
hurt The train was the fast freight
that passes on tho local track, but had
just switched and was going 6low at
the time of the wreck, which kept off
any serious damage.
TRIMBLE LOTS '
BRING $10,000
7 i
Sale of New Addition Brings!
Good Results.
The sale of the lots of the S. Y.
Trimble addition to Hopkinsville, just
outside the city limits, on South Vir
ginia street, was held Tuesday morn
ing. The addition will be formed in
to a court and constitute a suburb to
the city,
There were thirty-eight lots offered
and they brought close to $10,000 for
the total. The lots ranged from one
to three acres in size. They will
have light and water connections.
The first lot was bought by Durrett
Moore for $700. Mr. Moore an
nounced that he would build immedi
ately. Music was furnished by Prof.
Farmer's band, of Princeton. A
Shetland pony was given away and
this was won by F. M. Carroll.
The sale was conducted by the
Newbury Realty and Auction Com
pany. This same company will con
duct a sale of about two hundred lots
on Durrett avenue on August 5.
This property is in the negro section.
It will be the first time a sale has ev
er been held for the colored people
of Hopkinsville.
The Married Guardsmen.
It is right and proper to allow mar
ned members of the National guard
to return home. It is now generally
recognized that it was a mistake to
send them off for Mexican service in
the first place. The regular army, in
recruiting soldiers, makes a practice
of rejecting married men, out of def
erence to the universal view that
posts of danger in the nation's ser
vice are for men without families de
pendent on them. The same rule
ougnt to oe lonoweu as lar as possi
ble, in transforming the militia organ
izations into federal army units. In
case of serious need, of course, there
could be no question of the propriety
of sending the married men to the
front, as was done in our civil war,
and is now being done by every bel
ligerent in Europe. But there is at
present no such emergency. There
are plenty of available single men in
the United States to perform any duty
that seems likely to devolve upon this
nation with regard to Mexico.
Almost without exception the mar
ried men went along with their regi
ments without a word of complaint.
They feared for their families, many
of them left with inadeciuate means
of support, but they feared still more
the imputation of cowardice or dis
loyalty to their country. It isn't fair
to force the guardsmen into such a
position. And although the difficulty
might have been met by congress
providing help for guardsmen's fam
ilies in all cases where it was not a!
ready provided for, it is a simpler
and more sensible way to let the
married men return home subject,
of course, to call if they should be
imperatively needed. And it's far
I fairer to the guardsmen's wives and
children than any make-shift pension
or charity system. Owensboro Mes
