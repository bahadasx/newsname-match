Washington. J"li' I'J. An attack by
Senator l-t Follette on the general
1,1 epat eilness program as the product
of imitation by moneyed interests,
inrted by the metropolitan press, pre.-;
w ilted a final vole in the senate to- !
day on the naval hill. The Wisconsin J
senator had not completed his speech !
when the senate
adjourned tonight
and illll not lllllicaie now iouk lie jm.iii
lied to continue. The
however, was that a
neral belief,
vote would be
l.-ached tomorrow.
Must of today was taken up with
an unsuccessful fiKht by Senators
(diver and J'enrosc on the section of
the hill providing- for ;i J 1 1 .lutll.tuoi
Hiiveriinient armor plant. Hy a vote of
(,l to IT the senate, defeated a mo
tion to strike out the section and
then voted down, CI to IK, the Oliver
amendment to refer the armor con
troversy to the federal trade commis
ninn for settlement.
Says Inci-ciaw Is Not Nidcd.
Senator Iji Follette contended vi
nronsly that neither conditions con
frontiiiH the nation nor the testimony
given before the congressional naval
committees warranted the proposed
navy increases.
"A total of $X44, MOO, not) Is the load
th.1t Koes on the bended backs of the
American people," he declared. "Why
Is this to he done? If it is necessary
now, why was it not necessary four
years ago', You knew then what the
naval and military strength of till the
fiitelk'ti countries was. Hut the in
terests had not been appealed to then
iKtlilihem Steel tit 40 was not licth
leluiii Steel at 4 hti. The interests
behind this preparedness plan do not
f"iir i lermany or I'tiKland. The dan
mert-ly fits into their imperialistic
Hellenics."
The senator charged that men had
hem forced into preparedness parades
under threats of bavins their wanes i
reduced. Working men in Washinx
t"n, lie said, had told him (hey march
ed in the demonstration here, for that
reason. Tile urK'st newspapers of!
the country, he said, were influenced (
by the advertising of the "interests'
behind Hie preparedness propaganda,
to devote most space to the testimony
'(' witnesses before the congressional
committees who favored prepa t edness.
"A cheap skate of a business man
''an Ret a column and a half on the
i rnnl page if he will boost prepared
ness," he shouted, "but C.etieral Wea
ver, who speaks against it, cannot get
a line. These newspapers sell their
editorial good will along Willi their
advertising. It costs something to say
thai, hut for some years I have stood
ready to pay the price."
Senator La Follette quoted volumi
nously from reports of the committee
bearings to prove that the navy is In
I "iter shape Ihau preparedness advo
cates make it appear. lie insisted
that II is stronger than Cermany's- mi
x. and pointed out that lermany,
with a navy nbout half as large as
lanMand's lias hern able to prevent an
mva-ion of her territory.
Senators i diver and Penrose, speak
iiu: against the armor plant proposal,
insisted that it simply would mean a

U'licni Steel company has off,

"It would lie little less than crimi

declared.

j State department officials said to

I when General Pershing's troops would
be withdrawn from Mexico, indicating
'thai this was a military i, nest urn en
itiraly in the hands of the war depart-
incut There have been intimations
that one of the subjects discussed iiyjiuu .. .,, n.i ,.n . ,

whether the ,iiesli,,n of withdrawal j

the joint commissioners for consider
ation. Since the Washington govern
ment has made It plain on every oc
casion that the troops would retire
whenever Carranzji troops could in
sure the security of the border, it ap
pears probable that Mr. Polk thought
it unnecessary for the commission to
Ko
into that subject and so informed
Mr. Arredondo.
I A dispatch from General Pershing
today saying that General Gonzales!
"an conierreu wnn mm as in lepoi.n
of the seizure of the Hearst ranch in
Chihuahua and then had proceeded
to Investigate the case, was viewed
here as further evidence of the more
conciliatory attitude of all Carranzu
officials. General Pershing had called
atlentloii to ibis change previously,
saying that the general opinion of
those Mexicans with whom he came
in contact was that a peaceful adjust
ment of all difficulties would be found.
The war department announced to
day a further relaxation of the unof
ficial embargo imposed at the border
when the Mexican emergency became
acute. Coal, coke and gasoline for
industrial purposes and household I
goods now will be permitted to pass
into Mexico, the announcement said.
In reasonable una nt it ies. Food audi
