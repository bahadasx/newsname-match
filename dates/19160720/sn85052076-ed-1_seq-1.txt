Nqt the Preacher But the Truth He Telia
This it what we often hear from back-slider "I do
not like the preacher." Now the preacher may be very
Imperfect, but he is the messenger of God Almighty, and
he is the appointed leader of the church. You must not
fail to be good even if some of youriellow Christians are
not all that you like. We (hall never have a church full
of perfect people, but we must be loyal to the church, for
other folk a failures will never save you!
And besides, how much better the preacher and
church might be if you came forward in a loving
spirit and did your duty!
And it is almost as bad when people-tay, "I like the
preacher." The thing we ought to like is the truth, and
the Heavenly Father who is behind the truth. Preachers
come and go, but the word of God is eternal.
"Whosoever Will"
. There is something more precious than money or
reputation. "The Pearl of Great Price" is being right
with God, and this "Pearl" is in the reach of every.per
son who will seek for it
The poorest person in the State of Kentucky may
have it. The richest and best educated person in the
State of Kentucky may miss it.
It is for "Whosoever Will." Will you? '
Our Military Weakness
The weakness of the United States in its military es
tablishment is not the lack of soldiers, but the lack of offi
cers. The small task of bringing to the field a few
thousand militiamen shows that our over-paid and pam
pered military officers are strikingly incompetent.
And the young men in the camps are in many cases
suffering from the immorality which the officers do not
suppress. Let us have a better army before we have a
bigger one.

A Spirited Specialist
John the Baptist was a spiritual
siecialit. an expert in the matters
of the soul. His specialty was pre
paring men for everlasting life. A
man of roomie vision, of vast soul
insight, he would fit men by hi sum
mon to a Godlike life for two
world. A character specialist, he
addressed himself in the first place
to the needs of the religious. The
in of the saints are ninny, ami have
lieen so throughout the ages. You
rememher that in speaking to Joseph
of the coining Christ, the angel said,
Thou shall call His name Jesus, for
he shall save His people from their
sin." The woes of John were pro
nounced upon the most professedly
religious of his day, the Scribe and
the Pharisee. And these were they
whom he summoned to repentance,
to a change of purpose, to prepara
tion, to a change of method.

WORLD IIEVS
The English and French troops
have continued their drive on the
western frontier against the Ger.
mans. They have advanced a dis
tance of ahout four miles and are now
attacking the third line of defense.
Theiresislance has been less severe
since the breaking of the first line.
The English have o d the cavalry
to good effect for the first time.
The ftussians are meeting stub
born resistance on the eastern
frontier of the war but seem to be
making headway against the Ger
man. The fighting has been parti
cularly desperate around the village
of Skrobowa. Russian armies are
much superior to those used in the
earlier stage of the war and tun
munition is abundant.
Pressure is being brought to bear
in Germany to secure the dismfssal
of the Chancellor, Bethman Hoi I wig,
and the appointment of someone
who will be favorable to a renewal
of the submarine warfare against
England, which was stopped by the
protest of the United States.
The feeling between Germany and
Italy is growing more tense owing
to the treatment by Germany of
Italians living on German soil. Italy
claims a violation of the agreement
made by the German diplomat, Von
Dulow, who has been trying to pre
vent a breach between the two
countries.
The German submarine, Deuch
land, which came into the port at
Baltimore has been officially de
clared to be only a merchant vessel
as it would require a reconstruction
to fit her for war. This decision
applies only to this one vessel and
submarines which follow this one
will have to be judged on their own
merits.
-A. large force is being quietly as-,
sembled at Salonika, in Greece, pre
paratory to an offensive movement
in that direction. The army is
largely made up of Servians who are
said to be in fine condition and anx
ious to get into action. English and
French transports have landed large
cumbers of troops, evading the Aus
trian and German submarines.
A revolt of the Arabians from
Turkish rule is imminent. For some
time they have teen restless and
being deeply impressed "with the
government of England in India,
they have been gradually turning
against Turkey. Such a revolt
would be an important factor in tha
Asiatic side of the war.
The Turks have been defeated by
the Russians to the west of Erzerum,
which place was taken some time
ago. They have thus opened up
still farther the way toward Con
stantinople along the southern shore
of the Black Sea.
Mexico and the United States have
agreed to a Joint Commission to
draw up a plan for the defense of
the frontier under a combined pa
trol. This is a substancial gain to
ward a peaceful solution of the Mex
ican trouble. Ik is reported that
better feeling is springing up in
Mexico toward Americans.
Coiutress has passed the Federal
Aid Road Bill which appropriates (85
oeo.ooo, for the construction or rural
post roads. By this bill the federal
government cooperates with the
states to the extent of one-half of
the expense of construction.
