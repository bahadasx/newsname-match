Declares Commissioner A. L.
Lehman.
The discussion of tho river trans
tion problem, which was started
among the business men of the city
by the visit and criticism of Col. Jad-1
jfjrln, of, the United State Engineers.
" As already resulted in soinc actual
good; Commissioner of Streets and
fjDocks, A. L. Lehman, this morning
stated that the wharf would be repair,
ed and placed in a more presentable
condition at once.
Mr. Lehman said: "While the wharf
at present is practically not being
used at all and the available space
is entirely ample to care for the oc
casional landing of a row boat, yet tho
street department will get to work
and remove the mud from the cobble
stones and repair tho landing as soon
as we can spare our men from tho Jobs
on which they are now employed. A
small amount of work on the approach
?will place the wharf in condition to
allow teams to get In and put easily.
This will be a much improved as is
now needed. In case wo have any
assurance that river traffic will be
revived and more wharfage facili
ties needed the city will take care of
the wharf proposition in a satisfac
tory manner."

Mayor Bowen endorsed the expres
sion of Commissioner Lehman and
stated that the city would do Its share
of encouraging river traffic. Speaking
of the propoEition of bringing Col.
Jadwin, who Is an expert on inland
water transportation, to Fairmont to
address the commercial organizations
on the Monongahcla river problem
Mayor Bowen said:
"While the city and the Board
of Affairs is always ready to as
sist in any undertaking that will
benefit Fairmont, yet I feel that it
Is up to the Chamber of Com
merce to take the initiative in this
matter. The development of any
particular Industry or solving of
any particular commercial or In- _
dustrlal problem is primarily the
purpose of the Chamber of Com
merce. That is the reason the
Chamber was established and It Is
in direct line with their aims and
duties. Therefore I am of the opin
ion that they should take the first
step. We of course are ready to
co-operate with them In any way
that would be of assistance in fur
thering the revival of the river
traffic."

ATTEMPT IS MADE TO INSERT
ANTI CATHOLIC DECLARA
TION IN PLATFORM
(By Associated Press.)
ST. PAUL, Minn., July 20.?Wheth
er William Sulzer of New York, by a
last hour appearance before the Na
tional rroUibUldiT convention could*
rally enough delegates to his support
to defeat J. Frank Hanley of Indiana,
for the presidential nomination was a
question that predominated virtually
every discussion when the convention
was called to order this morning.
An effort to inject an anti-Catholic
declaration Into the platform caused
the Resolutions committee to go into
executive session while a bitter de
bate waged.
TO BE REAL TIG
Big Crowd of Rooters Ex
pected to Accompany the
Teams Here.
Fairmont will get to see one of the
best baseball games that was ever
played when the Monongah and Bal
timore division have their game here
next Saturday. This game is for the
championship of the system. A cup
is to be presented to the winning team
by A. W. Thompson, vice president of
the Baltimore and Ohio.
The freight house will close at 12
o'clock so all the employees can see!
the game. The foremen of the shops!
and round house will let as many men
off as can be spared.
The players of both teams will ar
rive here on train Xo. 71 and will leave
on train o. 4. The players of the
Baltimore division are picked from
the best in the Central Building at
Baltimore. The men on the Monon
gah division are picked from a radius
of 500 miles. The train which will
carry the players will also carry an
extra car for the rooters from up
the river. Among them will be Super
intendent Scott and his entire staff.
Most likely Jack Lattemes will pitch
for the Monongah division and Curry
will do the receiving. A big crowd is
expected to turn out.
Tonight the car shops and the
freight houso will play. The game is
scheduled to start at six thirty sharp.
There Is great rivalry between these
two tenms and an interesting game
is assured.

German Chancellor Under
Fire of the Conserva
- tive Party,
SOCIALISTS FOR KIM
His Tax Policy Another
Thing That Is Causing
Trouble.
BERLIN, June 12.?(Correspond
ence of The Associated Press)?The
Reichtag session just closed was mark
; ed by interesting developments in the
relations between the government and
the various political parties. One re
sult was to bring out more sharply
than hitherto the opposition of the
Conservatives to Chancellor Bethmann
Hollweg.
I The Conservatives represent the 0I6
1 aristocratic traditions of Prussia, and
their social and political influence is
i so great that they usually succeeded
under previous Chancellors in shaping
the course of the government. They
have ever taken the lead in casing all
socialist and democratic tendencies in
the state; and before the war one of
their chief lines of policy was war up
on the Socialists as an element dan
gerous to the monarchy and tho pros-1
ent order of society. Since the war
I has been in progress.' however, the
government has quite changed its at
titude toward the Socialists. The?
! Chancellor has steadily acted in the
spirit of the Emperor's declaration,
made just as the war was about to
begin, that hencoforth he knew no par
ties, but only Germans.
The loyalty with which the Social
ists have stood by the government and
helped to fight the country's battles
1 has been more than once recognizea
by Bethmann Hollweg in his speeches
! in the Reichstag, and he has clearly
admitted this fact must lead to some
political readjustments after the war
is over. This has never pleased the
Conservatives. But the Chancellor
has gone on his way making friends
of the Socialists and inviting their
support for government measures. The
I Conservatives lookod on coldly at all
this, for they saw that their best ar
gument for keeping the government
1 rigidly conservative was being wrest
i ed from their hands.
Besides this, the Conservatives have
taken ofTense at the government's tax
ation policy. They are fully commit
ted to the view that the Empire must
collect its revenue taxes through indi
rect taxation, like customs duties, and
internal revenue taxes of various
kinds. Especially do they urgently in
sist that direct taxes?income, general
property, and inheritance taxes?
should be reserved for the federal
states. The huge problem, however,
of raising revenues to pay interest on
the war debt, to pay pensions, and
meet other expenses growing out of
the war. cannot be solved withou: re
sorting to direct taxation?there are
not enough indirect taxes in reach to
meet the requirements of the situa
tion. Hence along with the various
Indirect taxes proposed this spring by

LAST GETS SITE
Will Have Basement and

env Building.
MURK Jf FAILS
Dispute About Space For El
First Floor of Deveny
Building.
Being unable to come to an under
standing on certain detail matters,
J. W. McCrorey of Five and Ten cent
store fame decided that he would be
unable to take the Deveny store room
in the Deveny building, now in course
of construction. F. W. Wool worth &
Company were waiting pending nego
tiations with a signed lease on the
building which lease is to run 21
years, and they promptly snapped the
building up today.
The basement will also be turned
over to the Woolworth company and
it is probable that they will make a
store room out of it too. The base
ment will he high enough to fix up a
salesroom and as 1ms been the case
with most all of the Woolworth stores
two rooms may be necessary.
The McCrorey company and Mr. Dev
eny could not agree on the basement.
The McCrorey company wanted the
entire basement which would leave
no room for the engines to run the el
evators and no room for the boilers
with which to make steam for the
building.
