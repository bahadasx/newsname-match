A Red Fex Tale.
One night last week the family
of John Hose on Beech Fqrk had
retired for the night, sleeping up
stairs, with several of the doors
down stairs open on account of
the heat, They had not been in
bod long . before they heard
pack 'of hounds coming in ful
tilt over" the ridge, from the deep
woods; making the music so dear
to a hunter's heart. They were
headed straight for Mr- Rose'
house and when.near it the dogs
stopped running, short oil and
were heard no more:
When the next day dawned
the Roses rose and went about
the daily affairs. One, going to
do the breakfast cooking, was
astonished to see a big red fox
coolly curled up under the kitch
en cabinet. With a shout' for
help, and one or two nice little
screams, the fun began. The
women folks armed with their
U8ualv weapons poker, rolling
pin and Rtbve-wood set in to
the fray in deadly earnest and
Mr. Fox saw in a moment that
in hiding iu there from the dogs
he bad: jumped' out of the frying
pan into the fire. The folks
fought well but the fox dodged
the better and quick out through
a window he went with a crash
and a red fox's swift good-bye?-
Somewhere among the lime
stone ledges of Beech Fork thai
fox is, resting, up (or ' another
chase when John Maxwell toots
his hunting horn in- the beech
grovesup 'there, but -it's' Jong.

leffiTuesday for Furnace to build

Russell, of Louisville, is getting

lots of oil lands in that section,
and we understand he is to drill
a number of wells, one at least
of which is where they have to
pump the water from the big
springs out to the top of the
mountain to rub the drilling en
giue. There is hardly a doubt
but we will have reports of some
fine wells for Mr. Russell.
Thirty Forty
We understand that they made
$30.40 at the ice cream supper at
the Christian church Saturday
night. The amount would have
been larger if it had not rained
as night came on. They had a
very pleasant time, enjoying the
occasion to the utmost, and the
cakes and cream were so good
that they cleaned up everything
they could eat, before the Con
cert Band had come to the final
tune "God be, with you till we
meet' again."

The Reason Why at Furnace
The Clay City Ball Team,
feeling mighty good over wollop
ing Stanton the other day, lit
out to Furnace, Sunday, tickled
to death with the way they were
going to lay out tho backwoods
boys up there, but the Furnace
boys were loaded for bear ; they
had a diamond in a last year's
corn-field, full of old bumps and
humps and cornstalks. But they
had a big game, all right enough,
and our boys were treated nice,
and had pie, and gassed some,
and smelt some gass, and finally
got the patchen knocked oil' of
them in the 9th inning the score
being 7 to 8, in favor of Furnace.
While our boys won't admit any
thing much, it's generally under
stood that the real reason for the
beat was our boys looking at the
at those pretty country girls who
came to cheer the other side.
But they played well, consider
ing the beauty, our boys did!
