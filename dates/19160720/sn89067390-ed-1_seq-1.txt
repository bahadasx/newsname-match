Prophecy Was Fulfilled
It was a sultry day in August 1394.
Pages were running heller skelter
through the aisles of the floor house
The galleries were crowded with spec
tator?, and as this was at at a time
before Woodrow Wilson discovered
that an "insidious lobbyist" was one
who argued for protection before the
committees of congress, the corriders
were filled with men who held a brief
for some commercial interest. Rep
resentatives were perspiring freely,
their collars wilted, their throats husky.
There was the usual rumble of voices,
interrupted frequently by the gravel of
Speaker Charles F. Crisp.
At length the gravel pounded hard
for order. The house quited down so
that a pin might have been heard to
drop. The tensest moment in many
weary months had apporached. The
53d congress in the last round of a
gruelling contest was about to vote on
the tariff act of 1894, familiarly known
as the Wilson bill. The yeas and nays
were ordered, and the conference re
port was adopted. The bill was ready
for the signature of Grover Cleveland

was then a congressman from Lincol ,
Nebr. He had fought throughout for
free trade: he was uncomprosimisingly

thrown to him. W;iile the cheering

hero of the transient f our, William J .

out on the shoulders of four brother

deafening, when rose up one Thomas

fl.t surface will "puddle" mor q ii
ly than the corrugated surface, henr
the water will begin to run more q'lirl
ly from the flit surface, while on th
corrujated surface more rain gets itit
the soil, which is very desirable in a
dry time.
Again, after the rain has ceased the
flit surhce will dry more rapidly, ami
crack open worse than will the corru
gated surface.
In view of these facts, any tool sue!
as a drag, mower cr corn planter wheel,
should have some harrow teeth so
placed that they will leave the surface
slightly rough. Where shovel tools
are used, the plowing should not b?
deep or very clore to the corn roots,
especially toward time for "laying by."
It would appear that corn roots finish
their grow'h early, and do not grow
much after the corn is large as can be
plowed with a two-horse cultivator.
Cutting ff the roots when they have
made their full growth does a damage
that cannot be repaired.
Cultivation should be frequent
enough to keep down weeds and to
prevent the crusting and cracking of
the surfaceJ
In supporting Mr. Hi 1, we feel that
we are suppoling a man who is emi
nently qualified to represent the people
at the national capital. He looks the
part, has the ability and is as "clean as
a hound'i tooth" in every respect.-

He is not an orator, but he is a
man of masterful force. He knows
how to accomplish things.
He made his own success and there
fore knows how success is made. No
man has ever accused him of unfair or
illegitimate business process.
He employs an army of men and
pavs cut ovtr a million dollars a year
in riges. Among the n:ost enthusi
astic of his political supporters are his
own employees.
He's a real American one by de
liberate choice and coniction. His
father was an Irishman anl his mrrher's
aticesto s fought with Gen- ral G:orge
Washington. II- is a m Miner and
and an oflhers of thtSon nf Anerican

protection of every American citizen
and interest, for social justice and for
the Republican national platform in

If Missouri can pick one of the big
business men of the west for senator,
it will do itself proud.
Immediately upon receiving news ol
the nomination of Hughes and Fair
banks, Mr. Guy Bell, editor of the
Irvine, Ky , Sun, worked up up a Re
publican meeting and had a Hughes
Fairbanks club organized within 36
hours alter the convention adjourned.
If that is the pace they follow in Ken
tucky, we can tell where the Kentucky
vote will be cast in November.
