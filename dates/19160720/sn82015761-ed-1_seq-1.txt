GAMPBELL
GOOD RECORD
Senator Hugh E. Campbell has
made so good a record in the state
senate that the democrats of Coco
nino county will doubtless renom
inate him without opposition.
Senator Campbell is one of the .big
men of the state, a fact so well rec
ognized that he has been frequent
ly mentioned as a posEible candi
date for governor.
SenatorCampbell was a . pioneer
in the stock business in Arizona
and during the succeeding years he
has become one of Northern Ari
zona's prominent stockmen. As a
business man he is a decided suc
cess and as such he should be. able
to help get Arizona's financial af
fairs upon a business basis. The
stafe legislature is sadly in need of
such men.
ED HUNTER EOR
Mr. Ed Hunter whose an
nouncement for the democratic
nomination for the office of Sup
ervisor appears in this issue of
the News is one of Coconino
county's real farmers. Mr.
Hunter came to Arizona 22 years
ago. For a number of years he
was engaged in railroad construc
tion having charge of construc
tion gangs first for the Union
Pacific and later for the Santa
Fe. He was uniformly success
ful in handling men and worked
nearly every nationality. " About
ten years ago Mr. Hunter
assumed the responsibilities of a
family man and he soon left rail
road work and bought a ranch
six miles west of Williams. He
applied such practical methods
to the development of his farm
that he not only made a good
living but was enabled to sell his
ranch at several thousand dollars
profit. Mr. Hunter is now
developing a ' homestead on
which he lives.
Ed Hunter has proved by act
ual practice that alfalfa can be
profitably raised in Coconino
county on lands with subirri?a
tion. In thn3 work he has done
a great service to Arizona Agri
culture. He believes that many
Coconino farmers may irrigate
enough land to supply the local
markets with garden truck and
for this purpose he builds tanks
for a water supply and encour
ages others to do likewise.
Ed Hunter has decided views
on the administration of county
affairs. He believes that such
administration eosts Coconino
county too much and Ms platform
is economy in the administration
of the affairs of Coconino
Hunter believes the agri
cultural development of the
county very necessary and to
promote it he would favor all
reasonable concessions to home
steaders. Band Boys Are Back, .
Tbe Barnes Bind Bors came
back from their weeks encampment
at Coleman Lake. 'Sunday. The
leader G. L. Barnes required some
work with instruments but on the
whole the encampment was practi
cally free from . work and worry.
Williams people supplied the boys'
commissary with many good things
to eat. W. M. Hughes sent out
two sheep, dressed for immediate
use. Airs. Hess treated the boys to
ice cram. Babbitt Poison sup
plied water melons. Others gave,
t o, so that the boys had a j lenty
of the best.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROSS
UP FOREELECTION
The News is pleased to
announce to its readers that
Henry D. Ross, Chief Justice
of the Arizona Supreme Court is
a candidate for reelection to the
Supreme Bench. Chief Justice
Ross was in Williams Saturday
toMondayTenewing old acquaint
ances and forming new. His
candidacy will be of especial in
terest to people , of Coconino
county for the reason that he
got his start in Yavapai county
of which Coconino is a part, and
his candidacy will be of interest
to Williams people, for the rea
son that in his early manhood
Henry Ross taught the Williams
school. While northern Arizona
claims Henry D. Ross he be
longs to Williams in a peculiar
sense. He lived here and was a
factor in the early development
of the town.
Henry D. Ross adopted the
piofession of law and In 1888 he
was elected District Attorney of
Yavapai county. His ability and
integrity were early recognized
and rewarded by positions of
trust and responsibility which he
was invited to fill. When Ari
zona was admitted to statehood
Henry D. Ross was one of the
three Justices elected to the
Supreme Court. His vote was
greater than that of either of the
other justices and, as provided
by the state constitution, he be
came Chief Justice. In casting
lots $oiix the tenure' of office he
drew the short teim"hnd .at the
end of two years he must seek
reelection ' s-' --
Henry D. Ross, Chief-Justice,
stands well with the lawyers of
his state. His opinions are rated
of the highest order in diction,
learning and. logic
While geographical" location
should not be used to foist upon
the public men of small ability
and less character, yet it will
appeal to all that, other things
being equal, different sections
should be represented in public
bodies and since Henry D. Ross
belongs to northern Arizona
and is a man eminently fit to
occupy a place on ; the supreme
bench of the state, northern
Arizona should be tor mm to a
voter. Henry D. Ross' name
will appear on tfce democratic
ticket at the September primary.
The law does not except the jud
iciary from a partisan declar
ation, tho in the opinion of the
News it should. But in the case
of Henry D. Ross, party affilia
tion should be forgotten. He
should have the solid vote of
northern Arizona in November.

ables him to view many public
questions from an angle unusual
to the average man. There can

was elected to the office of Super
visor two years ago. In the deter
mination of the tenure of office of
the three men elected Supervisors,
Mr. Woolfolk drew the short term.
The satisfaction which he has giv
en by his services in this office is
so general that his nomination as
one of the two democratic candi
dates, is practically assured.
' As a Supervisor he has stood for
efficiency and economy in the ad
ministration of the affairs of the
county. If nominated and elected,
he will continue to insist on effi
ciency and economy in local ad
ministrative affairs to the end that
Coconino tax-payers shall get full
value for the money collected from
them. Mr. Woolfolk is engaged
in the sheep industry iD the Can

interests are with stock raibers but
he is broadminded and under
stands the general needs, of his own
county. He can be trusted to do
justice to every interest in Coco
nino County.

T. H. CURETON OF
LEGISLATIVE CALIRER
It is very important that
our
next legislature should be made up
of men with a knowledge of the
legislative needs of the state
and with ability to administer to
those needs. Voters of all parties
should therefore scrutinize the
names which will appear on" the
pnmary ballot as candidates for
legislative honors with a view to
detoi mining which candidates have
sufficient caliber to fill the positions
to which they aspire. Among
those names will be that of T. H.
Cureton of Williams and an invest
igation of his qualifications can not
fail to convince an unprejudiced
mind that they are exceptional and
fit him for a legislative career. A
progressive republican, Mr. Cure'
ton will have to look to the repub
licans of Coconino county to place
his name before the voters of the
county, but should he receive the
nomination, the voters of Coconino
could safely commission him to
look after their interests in the leg'
lsiature ny electing mm in
November.
T. H- Cureton' a qualifications
Coconino county's representative
in the lower house of- the legisla
ture should be a man well endowed
educationally and with a knowl
edge of the principles of law, that
he may hold his own with the best
talent.in the house and be able to
help in framicg the important leg
islation which the best interests of
the state demand. Such a man is
T. H. Cureton. Having completed
the four years arts course in the
University of Kansas ,and also the
cour se of law Itibai celebrates in.
stitution and then taken a post
graduate course in Harvard Uni
versity, he would be the peer of the
best equipped members of the
House in the point ot intellectual
attainments.
Arizona is a progressive state
which occupies a high moral plane
among the galaxy of states forming
our nation. Coconino county needs
a man in the lower house of the
Legislature who will aid in keep
ing our state in the van guard, both
politically and morally. T. H
Cureton is such a man. He has
lived in Williams for a number of
years and he has always promoted
progressive movements tending to
ward moral uplift.
Mr. Cureton is a resident of Co
conino county in the true sense.
He is identified with the material
interests of Williams as a property
owner and taxpayer. His consid
erable interests are all in Coconino
county and he remains in the
county to look after them.
With T. H. Cureton in the legis
lature, Coconino county would
have no cause to blusb for her rep
resentative. He would look after
her interests with ability and
fidelity. "
DON'T FORGET THE
PRECINCT OFFICES
Candidates for county offices are
announcing themselves and there is
a prospect of a large number of
good men to select from. It should
not be forgotten that there are
precinct offices to fill this fall and
some of them pay petty well.
There are four justices of the peace
and four constables to be elected.
These offices pay from $360 to
$1,500 and good men are needed
to fill them.
F. D. Crable of Flagstaff was a
caller at the News office yesterday.
Mr. Crable is a candidate for the
republican nomination for County
Attorney.
