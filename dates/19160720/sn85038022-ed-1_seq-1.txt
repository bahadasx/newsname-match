Chlllleothe. Ohio. .Inly 1-The Ohio
State l.eegue gave up toUy and de
cided (o eult for the season. Recently
Huntington and Frankfort dropped
out. and It was decided to try to run
the last half of the season with four
clubs.
1 Lexington, however, was unable to
hold up Its end, and forfeited ita fran
chise and today It was decided to dis
band the league.
1 A telegram ws received here yes
terday afternoon by President Ruasell
from I'resldant Cnrr advising him that
the remaining games of the season
were cancelled and the future of the
league waB very much in the dark.
' If the league should break up It
iwlll be on account of Lexington's
stand at the end of the first half. The
l-ex-lngton team tlrst decided to sell
Intact to the Huntington Roosters and
later went back on the agreement. Of
course Huntington was peered and the
chances of putting the Ohio State
League In Huntington were forever
closed. Lexington played four games
In the second half and then threw up
'the sponge. This left three teams, all
of whom were willing to finish the sea
son. Huntington is a good baseball
low n and If the Lexington team had
transferred her team to that city, the
season would have been flalshed with
everybody satisfied.
The local men who are backing the
team said thlB morning that they were
doing their best to make the league
go on but admitted that It looked hope
less. Ironton is the only salvation of
the league and it will be knawn by
night whether or not the league will
Igo on or not.
If the league gives up the ghost a
Semi-professional team will be organ
ized here to play on Sundays. This
twill be a great thing for those back
ling it for many will want to see ball
whether organized or not.

Work has been begun on the dam
in Limestone Creek nesr Hrodt's
i blacksmith shop. The dam Is being
built to prevent the water from un
dermlalng the road way. A wall baa
been built along there to stop the
washing away of the side of the creek
but this does not seem to do the work
aa It was expected to do. Tile dam
will make the creek bed almost even
with the road and will entirely remove
the danger of washing away any part
of the road during a heavy storm. 8ev
eral years ago there was a dam at this
place but It was torn down for some
reason or other. Farrow ft Co. have
the contract to build the dam.

Martin Full, who escaped from the

was recaptured by Special Detective
Thomas Stewart of the C. ft O. and
Officer Throckmorton Tuesday night
He was given a trial in Squire Fred W
Bauer's Court yesterday afternoon and
sentenced to one year in Jail. This
shows that it is a pretty hard matter
to get away from the local police and
escaped prisoners when recaptured
will get a pretty stiff sentence.

The Bureau of Vital Statistics of the
State Hoard of Health has Issued bul
letins showing the number of births
and deaths recorded In Mason county
and the State of Kentucky during the
first four months of 191B. They will
issue these bulletins by months aa
soon as they can be tahulated In the
8tate office, In order to enable the
health officers and the people to know
the exact spot where preventable dis
eases are reaping their richest har
vest and to guard against the invasion
of such diseases by advance knowledge
of the occurrence In adjacent territory.
It will be seen that deaths from pre
ventable diseases are responsible for
nearly one half of the deaths and If
the knowledge concerning the pre
vention of these diseases were prac
tically applied, the citizens of this
county and of other counties would
save a great deal of money paid out
to physicians and druggists.
Mason county ranks rather high In
the death rate as compared to the oth
er counties in the 8tate having 109
deathB to Its credit for the first four
months of the present year. The
deaths by months are: January, 28;
February, 31; March, 30, and April,
22. During this time there has been
118 births in the months respectively:
January, 32; February, 30; March, 35;
April, 21.
The following is the record of death
and the causes from which the persons
died:
All deaths, 109.
Aged one year and under, 18.
Age one to five years, 6.
Age live to sixty-five years, 46.
Age 65 years and over, 40.
Tuberculosis of lungB, 13.
Other tuberculosis, 1.
Pneumonla-bronco-pneumonla. 24.
Diphtheria croup, 1.
Menegttis other than tubercular, 1.
Measles, 2.
Dysentry and diarrhoea (over 2
years), 1.
Influenza, 6.
Cancer, 4.
Puerperal septicemia, 1.
Violence, 2.
Preventable, 62.
Total births, 118.
It may be possible that some child
has escaped registration by the at
tending physician. This is becoming
more and more important to prove the
age of a child and its rights under in
heritance laws and to protect itB per
sonal and social rights. For example
only a very few people in the State of
Kentucky can prove by any sort of of
ficial record who their ancestors were
a few generations back, and there
would be considerable difficulty to
prove whether they were white or
black bo far as any official record of
it has been made. If any citizen de
sires to know whether or not the birth
certificate of his child has been reg
istered in the State office tor perma
nent preservation, an inquiry directed
to the State Registrar, Bowling Qreen
Kentucky, will show whether or not
a physician or any one else responsi
ble under the law has been negligent
In protecting the rights of such child
