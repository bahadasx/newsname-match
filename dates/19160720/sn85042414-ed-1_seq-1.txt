RESOLUTIONS
COMMITTEE IN
BITTFFL FIGHT
Effort made to Include Anti
Catholic Clause in Pro
hibition Platform.
SULZER ARRIVES
ON SCENE TODAY
I Hanley Leaders Confident
That They Can Win on
First Ballot.
St. Paul,' July 20.—An effort to In
ject an anti-catholic declaration into
the prohibition platform caused the
'resolutions committee to go into ex
ecutlve session, while a bitter debate
was waged.
When the convention opened at
9:46 this morning, the' Hanley man
agers predicted his nomination on the
first ballot this afternoon, and ex
pressed confidence in their ability to
withstand Suizer's expected effort to
stampede the convention. Sulzer ar
rived in St. Paul shortly before 11
o'clock and went into a hotel confer
ence with friends.
The report of the committee on the
credentials was adopted without ob
jection. It showed 727 delegates and
86 alternates on the floor. Thirty-nine
states and the District of Columbia
are represented. There are ten com
plete state delegations.
The much heralded appearance of
Sulzer before the convention for pres
idential nomination has not material
ized. He said at the hotel that he did
not come seeking the nomination, but
in response to friends' pleas to ad
dress the convention.
The proposed platform says the
democrats blundered in the Mexican
situation, and the republicans evaded
the responsibility.
St. Paul. July 20.—Mrs. Florence
BlOwn Hyde, of Chicago, who has had
charge of the work among women in
behalf of the prohibition party, out
lined plans for the campaign to win
the women's votes, in an address be
fore the convention proper today.
Mrs. Hyde said in part:
"I want to emphasize that we are
facing a presidential election in which
4,000,000 women have the privilege
of voting:- that these women and the
women of the non-suffrage states are
being organized continually as women
iji behalf of every kind of political
propaganda.- —THtt' fhg" Wo«I«fPW *w-
garrlzattona of various kinds are b«r_
trig taken into iotfelderatio'ri more
and more by politicians and office
.seekers", that'women are for. the time
being tit least going tb hand them
selves to work for the changes in
government which tliey want as wom
en that the first consideration of the
woman votei1 and the woman civic
Worker who is not a voter is bound
to be .given to the obtaining of legis
lation which will give equality in law,
which will even up the scale of Jus
tice.
"There is no doubt but that a ma
jority of women are against the liquor
traffic and w.ould give to prohibition
their first consideration if properly
organized. Shall we ask the women to
lose their identity when they join the
prohibition party or shall we give
them an opportunity to speak and
work for the things which they want
as women—make them feel that they
amount to something as a distinct
force. Take it from me the feminist
movement which is based on woman's
desire for self-expression for individ
ual action, will not tolerate anything
political which even appears to mean
woman's loss of identity. Men have
had an opportunity this long time for
full and free self-expression and when
it has been denied them they fought,
bled and died to regain or preserve It.
"In our educational propaganda
among the women we must recognise
the other issues for which our plat
form will undoubtedly declare, and
show them that the other things
which they want for the benefit of the
child and the home, hinge upon the
solution of the liquor problem, that
the prohibition cause is the central
axle on which revolves the program
of human conservation.
"I believe that it is to the Interest
of the party to put forward many
women candidates. In the first place
we have many capable women who
are available, who have more time
for campaigning than does the aver
age man candidate. Secondly, we can
get more publicity for a woman can
didate and thirdly, we should em
phasize that we stand not only for
giving the ballot to woman but for
giving her a chance to help administer
our government.
"Let us catch the vision of the op
portunity that is ours. We have al
ttttttttttttttttttttt eaoin shrdlu eaoiiili
ways believed that the women would
vote with us If they had a chance,
and they will if we can get our prop
osition before them squarely and fair
ly. In Illinois where women have sep
arate ballots because of our limited
suffrage, we know that they voted dry
two to one as a separate Issue "on the
ballot. The only reason that theae
lame Illinois women and the women
In other suffrage states have not vot
ed the prohibition party ticket is be
cause they have been misled by non
partisan theory of political action,
which they have heard so many of
the good men of their acquaintance
advocate."
WHO SUPPLIED THE
NICKEL FOR U-BOAT?
Ottawa, Ont, July 10.—The ques
tion as to who supplied, the nickel
which will be such a valuable part of
the submarine Deutschland's cargo on
her return to Germany became of
added interest here with the an
nouncement that an official statement
will be issued within a few. days on
the whole policy of the British and
Canadian governments in respect to
the sale of the metal.'
Officials challenge the statement of
George p. Graham, former minister
of railways in the Laurier cabinet,
that Canadian nickel sold to Ameri
can firms on condition that It shall

Today's war reports are con

Russian and French armies. In
the eastern theater, the Russians
are moving ahead at a rapid rate,
shoving the foe back at all points
of the long front. Two Carpathian

have been taken by the Muscovites,
while they also hold command of
the Delatyn-Budapest railway.
Their cavalry is moving in the rear
of General Pflanzer's forces be

apparently the invasion of Hungary
is well under way.
According to one report, a Rus

the Austrian rear in the moun

There were moments of sanguinary
