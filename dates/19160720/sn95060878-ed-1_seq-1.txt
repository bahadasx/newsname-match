Yuma County Users' Association, by
J. M. Thacker, President.
The first regular extension, or mov
able, schools conducted by the Agri
cultural Extension Service of the
University of Arizona were held un
der the direction of the County Farm
Advisors at Wilcox, Cocihse county,
June 8 to 10; at Snowflake, Navajo
county, June 15 to 17; and at Eagar,
Apache county, June 19 to 21. Local
arrangements for these schools were
in charge of the local or county farm
improvement associations and all lo
cal expenses connected with the
schools were sold, the proceeds from
which defrayed the local expenses.
While the attendance was not large
in any case, .the interest was intense
and it was generally agreed that the
next extension schools would be more
largely attended and teh farmers vot
ed them a great success. In each case
the 'school lasted three days and a
faculty of five farm specialists gave
practical, systematic instruction on
farming matters. The principal pur
pose of the instruction given is to
drive home the details of the plans of
agricutltureal development which are
being adopted by the county farm
improvement associations, where
there is a farm advisor.
On account of lack of funds it has
been necessary to discontinue the
work of Mrs. EUith C. Salisbury,

Department of Agriculture ogered to
contribute $1,200 to the work of these
