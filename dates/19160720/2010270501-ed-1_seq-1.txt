VERY INTERESTING AUTO TRIP
Speakers at Purlnton grove followed
good dinner with Interesting
series of talks
A crowd conservatively estimated
at three hundred Box Butte county
farmers, their families and business
men attended the Horvest Picnic at
t he Purlnton grove, six miles narth
of Alliance, on Tuesday, July 18th.
The Agricultural Excursion started
from Hemlngford at 8:30 o'clock.
A fair crowd attended the excursion
and made the trip over the country
. The Herald reporter enjoyed the trip
: greatly,, by courtesy of George Moll
ring, who kindly took the reporter
and W. O. Barnes along in his big
Cadillac roadster, which made the
trip without a murmur and on high
11 the time.
Three auto loads left Alliance and
were Joined by four more at Hemlng
ford. The first stop was at the farm
of A. H. Bacon, where a demonstra
tion vai , given of Winter Wheats,
Pottoes, Corn Experiments, Oot
Brauth and Alfalfa and Clover seed
ing. . Mr. Bacon hes been' in the
: county about flur years. He Is at
'present cutting wlnterywheat which
. . was sowed en semi-fallowed ground.
- This wheat was sowed on August 1st,
a half-bushel to the acre. It will
yield twenty-five bushels per acre.
He is a very successful grower of po
tatoes and has had excellent results
trora treating, using corrosive subli
mate. His corn tests were Interest
ing. Northwestern Dent is being
tested to determine adaptability to
our conditions. His aot smut demon-
y st rat Ion showed very low per centof
smut in treated portion, with these
oats showing a bigger yield. Alfal
fa and sweet clover were seeded with
the oats.
The next stop was made at the
farm of Luke Phillips northwest of
Hemlngford. Mr. Phillips has lived
in the county about thtrty years and
has been rallslng horses In large
numbers the greater part of the time.
He ralces the draft type of horses and
has about one hundred head lu tie
corral. George Mollring, who In an
expert horseman, took much Interest
in the horses. Some very fine mares
were on exhibition. The now con
crete home of Mr. Phillips attracted
much attention, as did the fin i ice
- cold lemonade served by Mrs. Phll-
1 linn to the thirsty travelers. Walter
Barnes drank six glasses, the Herald
reporter five and C. H. Burleigh four
, giving the prlie to Mr. Barnes. In
ndditlon to the cement nous Mr.
Phillips has built a cement block
ir koiM In which Is installed an
upright gravity pressure tnnk, furn
inhinir wetnr over the place. Mr.
Phillips has very fine alfalfa In rows
seeded In 1914. Part of this has al
reidv b.in cut for hay. 'he remainder

All of his
mM trpated In 1916. The seed '
taken from oats treated In 1915
thowed not a smutted head in the
srventy-five acre field. Mr. Enyearfs
water system also attracted much at
tention. He has a stand pipe twenty
five feet high and eight feet In diam
eter, with a complete water system
over the home place and in the
house, all put in at a cost of about
$1,000.
The neit stop made was at the
home of George Carroll, a short dis
tance directly east of Hemlngford.
Mr. Carroll is one of the county's
largest potato growers. In 1915 he
had 100 acres that averaged 140
bushels to the acre. 13.000 bushels
of this crop were sold at an average
of forty cents per bushel, bringing
him $5,200. A well-prepared seed
bed, with good, sound well-kept po
tatoes for seed are considered essen
tial by Mr. Carroll. He has found
that with a well-prepared seed bed
little trouble Is experienced In keep
ing potatoes free from weeds and
hardly a weed was to be seen In his
fields; and that when potatoes are
properly stored and kept cool as pos
sible that he has a guarantee of a
good stand. A co-operative potato
demonstration is being conducted on
this farm.
One thing that impressed The Her
ald's reporter was the familiarity
with crops and farms shown by
County Farm Demonst rator . F. M.
Seidell. Mr. Seidell is the most thor
oughly posted man In the county on
conditions of crops and on the coun
ty farms, showing that he Is paying
strict attention to business. He is
well liked by the men with whom he
comes in contact and has impressed
them with the importance of his
work and has secured their co-oper
ation.
Oat smut and potato demonstra
tions are being conducted on the farm
of John Wlltsey, the next one visited.
In 1915 Mr. Wlltsey treated his oats
for smut and no smut was found in
the treated portion. The oats were
treated again this year. Without
treating but a slight trace of smut
was found and this shows even in the
second year later. More or leu con
tamination is carried by the thresh
ing machines from other farms.
At the Joe Heiman farm the visit
ors were shown a one herd or H01-
stein cattle and some excellent Po
land China pigs. Mr. Helman's ex
perience with Holstein cattle has been
more than satisfactory. People told
him 'at first that he would have to
keep his Holstein cattle in a glass
cage, but be has found them hardy
and willing to eat the usual rough
feeds. He showed two cows that are
at the present time, on dry pasture,
averaging fifty-five pounds of milk
per day. He believes in raising Po
land China pigs. 'In 1915 he sold
one Utter of ten pigs at the age of
eight months which weigh d an av
eraee of 312 pounds. It pays to raise 1
the right kind of hoes and they make
gooa proms in uox nuue couniy. ATifollnrt thljt . -uccessful wav of Dlant-
Mr. Heirran's farm the ladies of the
house treated the crowd to cold lem
onade and cakes, which were eaten
with much relish.
About three hundred were present
at the Purlnton grove for dinner. The
dinner was one that will be long re
membered by those of u-who are not
fortunate enough to be fed daily at
a fine farm tpble, and the Indies who
prepared lit have the thanks of all.
Two long tables were piled hish with
everything to be desired, from roast
chicken and dreetdng to rake aad
dainties. One man from California
remarked that It was well worth the
long trip to Box Butte county to be
able to partake of the big feed. Huge
barrels of Ice cold lemonade helpt d
to make the dinner one of absolute
contentment. Among those whom
we noticed taking a second helping
wre Harry Coureey, W, R. Harper,
J. S. Rheln. A. D. Rodgers. i:arl Mal
lery. John Guthrie, W. J. Root, L. H.
Highland. George Heilman, and a
number of others from Alliance.
President Browne Griffith of th;
Farmers Club presided at the meet

those who spoke were Prof. P. L
Gaddis, extension siieciafist, on "Crop
Conditions in Nebraska:" Prof. Er

Agronomy, on "Farming in Western

statements made.
The ball game between the Berea
Hard-Hitters and the Box Butte Griz

The score was 14 to S in favor of
the Berea Hard-Hitters. The game
Was umpired by Lloyd Thomas of
The Herald force.
A rainstorm drove many people to
their homes, so that only a small
number completed the day's trip. The
first stop in the afternoon was made
at the D. E. Purlnton farm, where the
pit silo, 14 by 22 feet, built top and
all with a cash outlay of only 1 3 5,
proved of Interest. The alfalfa in
rows showed up very well. Mr. Pur
lnton is also testing the Northwest
ern Dent corn.
At the farm of C. L. Powell win
ter wheat was seen which bad been
needed In corn stalk ground in the
latter part of October. One bushel
per acre was drilled about two and
ne-half to three Inches deep. This
wheat should make at least twenty
1 ne bunhels per acre. Mr. Powell has
ing winter wheat. Sixty-five acres
of fine alfalfa, coded in 1913, was
cut three times in 1915, yielding
about 120 tons. It was drilled in
August following a winter wheat
crop.- Mr.- Powell's domestic water
supply system proved very Interest
ing. It was installed at a very rea
sonable cost and proves very satis
factory. He has a farm which never
fails td attract interest and Is assist
ed by his energetic sons who are mak
ing a study of farming on a scientific
basis. .
The cane, kafflr and sorgo tests on
the next farm visited, that of F. M.
Russell, are being conducted for the
purpose of determining the desirabil
ity and adaptability of these crops
for Box Butte county conditions.
Winter wheat cultivated Into coin
stalk ground in the fall of 1915 has
Jufet been cut and shocked. He finds
this the most successful way of rais
ing winter wheat planting in
'" n
fields.
On L. J. Schlll's farm south' of Al
liance, the last one visited, the co
operative corn, experiment-Is bin;i
conducted In co-opetation with the
Bureau of Plant Industry to deter

experiments are heing made to deter
mine the advisability of planting seed
potatoes for seed purposes under
mulch. Co-operative potato demon
1 rations o( trodied and uutrcaind
potatoes are being conducted on this
farm. Other things of Interest bvre
were the stave silo, the big dairy
barn and the milking machine In
operation. The work of the garden
club and poultry club members at
this farm are also things of interest.
Mr. Schll's farm is always a place of
Interest to anyone wbo likes to learn j
new things about farming.
All who took part in the excursion
and picnic felt well repaid for the
time spent and the labor performed.
The success of the day was made
possible by the co-operation of the
Box Butte Farmers' Association.
