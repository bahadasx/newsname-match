Work of County Agriculturist
Pedigreed grains are now being grown
by over one thousand farmers in Mich
igan, and work has reached a stage
which makes it desirable from both the
standpoint of the College and the far
mer to follow up with field and granary
inspection In order to make the num
ber of varieties grown as small as pos
sible and to standardize them bo that
large quantities of the same variety of
grain may be available, the state au
thorities are certifying only the follow
ing: lied Hock wheat, Rosen rye,
Michigan winter barley and Worthy,
Alexander and Success oats. J. W.
Nicholson, of the Farm Crops Depart
ment was in the county on Monday for
the purpose of carrying out the field in
spection of wheat and rye. No one
had grown the Bed Hock long enough
to have any for sale during the present
year and owing to the pressure of the
work In other localities where quanti
ties would be for sale, Mr. Nicholson
only spent one day in St Clair County.
An excellent Held of Rosen rye was in
spected at the county farm and found
to be in very good condition and free
from bad weeds. During the day also
the following men were visited and
made acquainted with the work: Wm.
Cavanagh and John Patterson, Brock
way townships E. J. Dougherty, John
Judge, Frank Foley, Biley township
and John Patterson, Columbus town
ship. The field inspection of the oats
will come about two weeks later.
The second Inspection is made be
tween threshing time and seeding.
The owner is notified a few days in ad
vance bo that he can have the grain
which he wishes to sell cleaned ready
for the inspector when he comes. If it
passes inspection, It is then placed in
sacks and sealed. The State Associa
tion will then stand back of such grain
and has established the prices: $2.50
Eer bushel for wheat; rye $2.25 per
ushel; oats, $1.50 per bushel; barley $2
per bushel. All growers of Worthy or
Alexander oats who wish to sell a por
tion or all of their crop should notify
this office at an early date so that their
needs can be looked after when Mr.
Nicholson returns to the county the
last of the month.
Some time last week was also spent
at the County Farm assisting in setting
up and starting a potato sprayer, and
one day was occupied with a trip to
the factory at Pontiac for additional
parts and information in regard to cer
tain details of machine. We have
equipped this machine with a special
attachment that has proven very effic
ient in the control of blight with the
large potato growers In the south-western
part of the state. The outstanding
feature is a boom with five trailing at
tachments each carrying a pair of noz
zles equidistant between two rows.
Each nozzle can be directed obliquely
upward toward the row opposite it at
any directed angle, thus throwing the
spray on the under as well as on the
upper side of the leaves. Five rows are
Bpraved at a time and it Is believed that
the farm at Goodells now has the very
best equipment available for the con
trol of potato Insects and diseases, and
it Is hoped that other growers will in
spect it with a view to providing like
outfits on their own farms.
