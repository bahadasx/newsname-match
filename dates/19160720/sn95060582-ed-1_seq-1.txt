Olney's Popularity
(Bisbee Review)
Geo. A. Olney's popularity as a
man and a citizen is not only with
democrats, but with republicans
as well. When Mr. Olney has
held public positions he has al
ways been impartial in' the dis
charge of public duty. Reports
came from Maricopa county that
hundreds of republicans are re
gistering this year as democrats
with the avowed pvrpose of vot
ing for Olney in the primary as
well as in the general election.
With George Olney as the demo
cratic candidate for governor,
Arizona can be put down as sure
for the entire democratic ticket
by not less than 5,000 majority.

From the Injuries
Lial, the young son of Mr. and
Mrs. John DeWitt, of whom brief
mention was made last week of
getting scalded, died from the
effects Friday afternoon, just a
few hours after the accident.
The women folks had been doing
the family washing, building a
fire near tne residence for the
heating of water, and after fin
ishing earried a tub of hot water
into the house for the purpose of
scrubbing some of the floors.
The little fellw in some manner
fell backward into it. Dr. Bazell
of Holbrook was telephoned for
immediately and reached here as
quick as an auto could bring him
and dressed the injuries, but the
child lived only a short time after
ward. Mr. DeWitt was away at
the time working on a reservoir
forty odd miles south of Winslow.
Word was sent to him and he ar
rived here Saturday morning
about three o'clock.
Lial Watson DeWitt was born
July 8, 1913, and had he lived an
other day would have been exact
ly three years old. He was a
bright little fellow and must
have suffered untold agony. The
remains were laid to rest Satur
day afternoon in the town ceme
tery. The family has the deep sym
pathy of this community in their
sad loss. Snowflake Herald.
Constipation and Indigestion.
"I have used Chamberlain's
Tablets and must say they are the
best I have ever used for consti
pation and indigestion. My wife
also used them for indigestion and
they did her good," writes Eu
gene S. Knight, Wilmington, N.
C. Chamberlain's Tablets are
mild and gentle in their action.
Give them a trial. You are cer

able laxative effect which they
produce. Obtainable everywhere.

the cottage that occupied his lot
on commercial street and is now
busy excavation for a basement.
We have been informed that he
will build a two store business
house there. What business he
contemplates entering into we

Billiousness and Stomach Trouble
' 'Two years ago I suffered from
frequent attacks of stomach trou
ble and billiousness." writes Miss
Emma Verbryke, Lima, Ohio. "I
could eat very little food that
agreed with me and I became so
dizzy and sick at my stomach at
times that I had to take hold of
something to keep from falling.
Seeing Chamberlain's Tablets ad
vertised I decided to try them. I
improved rapidly." Obtainable

Taking Big Chances.
It is a great risk to travel with
out a bottle of Chamberlain's

Remedy, as this preparation can
not be obtained on the trains or

very severe, and everyone should
