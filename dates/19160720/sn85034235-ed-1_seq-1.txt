THE BACK

Tale of a Th illing
Ride In a Motorcar
By FRANK M. O'BRIEN
Copyright by Frank A. Munsey Co.
When I tell you that I never saw
young Mr. Gerald Forbish in his
original form, you may wonder that
I should attempt to write of him on
matters so strictly personal. P>ear with
tue patiently.
I was blind at the time. My rigid
nerve had developed clmrley-horse, and
was not putting the optics over the
plate. My doctor gave it a long name,
emptied the Arctic sea, drop by drop.
Into my beautiful blue eyes, and put on
n bandage. When he had pinned the
far end of my optic shroud he told
me that I would be blind for two
weeks.
"Meanwhile," he advised, "have all
the fun you can."
"Ball games," I suggested, "and visit
ing the Metropolitan museum?"
"Neither," he said, "nor aviation
meets—nor pantomimes."
"We have no pantomimes In Amer
ica," I replied. "You must have read
about them In that holiday number of
the Graphic which has been on your
waiting room table since my mother
brought me here with whooping cough.
As far as aviation meets are concerned,
I can go to the field and hear the bones
crack when they fall, can't I?"
"Too racking on the nerves," he de
cided. "Try automoblling, unless you
have learned to play the piano in the
dark. Good day, and keep the band
age on."
As I could not play a piano at all.
even were all the unarrived constella
tions beaming upon It, and as I had no
motorcar, nor the means of getting
one. I wns sad as I went home on the
arm of a messenger boy, wbo wns only
forty-five years old, and who seemed
to feed a sporting fancy In lettiug me
miss taxicabs by the length of a butch
er's lead pencil.
The angels heard my prayer, and the
next morning Mr. roter Forbish called
me up. The telephone is a joy to the
blind.
"Come motoring with us today,"
said Mr. Forbish. "I want you to see
our new car and our son Gerald, just
home from college."
1 explained that I couldn't see either
of them, but that I would be proud to
listen to both.
"The car," said Mr. Forbish, "Is
absolutely silent."
So I went to their house.
The Forbisbes condoled with me
about my eyes, and Mrs. Forbish told
me a soothing story about a friend
who had had eye trouble which she
considered just like mine, and who
had been jollied along for years by the
doctors, who told him each week that
"have no fear," repeated the fond
FATHER.
he would be able to see the following
week, but, of course, it was all a kind
lie, and—
Gerald came In, and I was Intro
duced.
He spoke perfect Harvard, and his
hand was clammy, it seemed to me.
but the blind, like the deformed, I re
flected, are always given to prejudice.
The car came to the door and we
sped away.
I sat in the wide, soft, back seat
with Mr. Forbish on my right and Mrs.
Forbish on my left.
Gerald, I fancied, was sharing the
front of the car with the chauffeur.
We entered a park gate at an acute
angle, and I could feci the curb take
three dollars and thirty-eight cents'
worth of rubber off a rear shoe.
"Your chauffeur," I comiueuted, 'is
a bit— er—er— snappy. Isn't lie?"
"We left our regular driver at home,
you know," said Mrs. Forbish. "GemlJ
is driving."
My forehead became like Gerald's
band.
I am a fatalist, but I do not believe
In putting pepper in fate's beer.
Blondin was blindfolded. I admit,
but he had a balancing pole, and no
Harvard undergraduate was allowed
on the wire with him. Besides, he had
the nice, soft, Niagara gorge to fall
Info; not a mess of telegraph poles.
Iron fences, or exploding gasoline
tanks.
"Have no fear with Gerald at the
wheel," said Mr. Forbish, whispering
lest Gerald hear him.
He used the tone of that inspiring
song. "My Dad'B the Engineer," which,
if I recall rightly, wqs contemporane
ous with "The Baggage Coach Ahead."
Somewhere In the park a band was
playing "Casey Jones," with staccato
on the bars.
We're goln' to reach Frisco.
But we'll all be dead.
"Have no fear," repeated the fend
father. "Gerald possesses all the cau
tion which has been linked with the
name of Forbish for generations."
I had not known tliat the nnme of
Forbish had been linked with anything
for any time. The word link always
reminds me of sausage, and then my
thoughts wander to 'Chicago, where
pork and other ingredients are Incorpo
rated Into frankfurters and other va
rieties of sausage.
Mrs. Forbish broke In on this pleas
ant line of thought.
"Say, rather," she remarked firmly,
"that Gerald inherits tjie coolness and
self possession of the McGlntys, famed
throughout Kildare for these quali
ties." *
I had not known tliat Mrs. Forbish
was a McGInty, but now, like a war
correspondent, I smelled the battle
from afar.
"A Forbish is a Forbish," said the
husband with Scotch finality, "and
Gerald Is one from every point of
view. I wish you were not blind, Mr.
Glow, so that you might study Gerald's
head. It is not necessary to see the
face to glimpse the F*»rblsh In every
line of the head's contour."
Mr. Forbish rested his case, it
seemed, but Mrs. Forbish did not let
It go to jury.
"If you knew anything about phre
nology, Peter," she said, "and If you
were not as blind through stubliornness
ns Mr. Glow Is through his ailment,
you would realize that the dominant
qualities of Gerald are inherited from
hla grandfather on the distaff side."
"Meaning Mike McGjnty, who took
the excursion to Tasmania?" queried
Mr. Forbish with sly brutality.
. "I did not refer to him," said Mrs.
Forbish, "but now that you bring the
matter up, please remember that it took
eight British constables, half of them
probably Scotch, to put that same Mc
Ginty on the ship. Ills blood may lie
responsible In some degree for Ger
ald's bump of combatlveness. which Is
so plainly to be seen alongside of each
ear." .
"Then perhaps," su.s^-sted Mr. For
bish. "you referred to old Edward
Ilalloran."
"The same," said Mrs. Forlilsh. "He
was a great man, none greater In Kil
dare. Through me from him have de
scended to Gerald the Inestimable
qualities of veneration, conjugality, pa
rental love, friendship and lnliabltlve
ness."
"That last one," said I, "doesn't
that moan staying In one place?" The
hind wheels of the ear had Just slew
ed In a tremendous arc.
"Oh, not in that sense," replied Mrs.
Forbish sweetly, retrieving herself
from my lap. "In phrenology It means
love of country."
"There's nothing In that phrenology
stuff." said Mr. Forbish. "It's the
general makeup of the head that
counts. Nature doesn't find it neces
sary In making the perfect head to
cover It with knobs like a Malay war
club."
I wished at the moment that I could
hoist the bandage long enough to see
whether Gerald had Buch a knobby
poll as his sire's remnrk suggested.
But Mrs. Forbish came to the rescue.
"Gerald's head Is perfectly symmet
rical," she declared hotly.
"Of course It is," replied Mr, For
bish. "Having nil the Forbish qual
ities. how could it be otherwise? On
It is written all the determination and
self sacrifice of the 'Scots wha hne wl'
Wallace bled.' "
"A set of haggis fed hirelings," said
Mrs. Forbish. "Sometimes when I
get to thinking about the Scotch I
wish I lmd married a Mecklenburger."
"We are just passing the reptile
house," remarked Mr. Forbish with
some evident wish to change the sub
ject. "Have you ever seen the collec
tion?"
"Yes," said I, "and the sight there
always filled me with wonder as to the
purpose of the Creator. Why, for In
stance, do such horrible creatures ex
ist as Gila monsters?"
"They make Scotchmen bearable by
comparison," sighed Mrs. Forbish. I
could see that she had her eye on the
ball and wns batting .800.
And Forbish saw it, too, for when
we passed tlie primate house a minute
later (I know the park's geography
even when blindfolded), he did not
litter a peep about It. It would have
been tossing a ball straight into the
batter's groove.
"Reverting to Gerald's head," sakl
Mrs. Forbish, directing her words at
me, "It shows in every line that he is
a young man of action. Mark me.
Gerald will do something"—
And, nt the very words, Gerald did.
lie played the old game, using the
car for the resistless force and one of
the largest park trees for the immov
able object. I know it was a large
tree, because I saw it a moment later
when my head, tired of bounding
along the sward, had tossed the band
age aside and stopped.
I saw Gerald, too, for the first time,
but I did not see his wonderful head,
because fate had wrapped the steer
ing post and a long blue mudguard
around it.
That evening I sat in the library of
the Forbish home, alone.
The elder Forbislies were In their
rooms, recovering rapidly and worry
ing about Gerald. My task was to get
bulletins by telephone from the hos
pital about their noble son.
After two orderlies had informed me
that Gerald had just died and two
more had said that he had been dis
charged, I had the luck to get an old
friend, Dr. Globb, on the wire. He
was one of the surgeons in the hos
pital.
"The young man will recover,"
Globb told me, "but It is a close call.
You see, he had the wrong kind of a
head to begin with."
"Explain!" I cried. And he did, but
In language that the doctors pay for
in college and swear to use all their
lives. I'erhaps it sounded like this:
"His skull, we found, was dolicho
cephalic to an extent hitherto unre
corded In medical annals, and the Im
pact reversed the gazilla. This left
the coronal suture waltzing with the
steplianion and the nasion telescoping
the orbit"
"A terrible thing to happen to a
young man of intellect" sakl L
"Intellect!" cried Blobb. "Intellect!
Is any one else on that wire?"
I assured him there was no one.
"Say," said he, "old Doc Kenken
delm, the cranium specialist, was here
J.J

"I SAW GERALD, TOO, FOB THE FIRST TIME,
BUT I DID NOT SEE HIS WONDERFUL
HEAD."
when they brought the youth in, aud
the old villain wanted to croak him
and put the head In alcohol so he
could study It at Ills leisure. He said
he wanted to find out how a human
being born with such a lack of mental
machinery could even live! He says
there's a minus mark nt every point-on
the diagram. But we cheeked his mur
derous designs, and he consented to
operate If he could lie permitted to
make the head all over again. He's
doing It now, and he's a real work
man. When our young friend comes
out he'll have n first class bean on
Ills shoulders, but he'll bo lighter by
about three pounds of excess ada
mant"
I went upstairs and called to the
anxious parents that Gerald was do
ing nicely and would soon be restored
to them.
"The doctors say," I added, "that a
man of less powerful Intellect would
not have survived."
"And yet I feel," said Mr. Forbish,
"that he will never be quite the same
again."
And Indeed, happily, he never was
the same.
8he Could Use Her Tongue.
They are saleswomen in downtown
stores. Both are now In the years that
make them of small Interest to men,
and naturally enough their interest
centers In "knocking" women who are.
They were bound downtown on a street
car, and the way they anviled, forged
and hammered every sweet young bud
In their whole establishment was a joy
to harken to.
"She's killing her complexion with
rouge," said one.
"And blackening her eyebrows until
they look like a bunch of crape on the
front door," spat the other.
Bing! Biff! Boom! Whee! Every
body got It. Finally one of the wallop
ers got off. When she had gone the
other turned to a girl sitting beside her
and said:
"Say, there's tlie fanciest knocker I
ever battled with. Me for coming
down on the same car with her every
morning. I wouldn't let her get 9 foot
away from me on a street car. She'd
tell the conductor I laced or had a past
I heard she was good, but she's a regu
lar Zeppelin. I'm going to be near her
when she drops her bombs.''—Indian
apolis News.
Motorboat and Fish.
Contrary to general opinion, a num
ber of motorboats cruising about a
harbor with more or less noisy en
gines have no appreciable effect upon
the fisli in nearby waters. It has long
been thought, particularly by fisher
men, that the presence of a noisy
motorboat would drive tlie fish away.
Exhaustive experiments recently con
ducted by the bureau of fisheries prove
this theory to be Incorrect.
In testing the effect of motorboat
noises on, fish a number of young scup,
known to be sensitive to sounds, were
placed In a large wooden cage. This
cage was fastened In quiet water at
the end of a wharf, and a motorboat
with a very noisy engine was run at
varying distances past the cage. At
no time did tlie fishes appear to be dis
turbed by the noise, except when the
splash from tlie boat hit tlie cage.
Then scup would generally dive to the
bottom of the receptacle.—Popular Sci
ence Monthly.
Geography.
Geography is the sum total of all th«
places In the map that we don't know
about Geography is made np of
boundary lines, river lines, dots and
dashes like a telegraph system and
shaded places which represent the
high spots. It is also colored to salt
the taste and in such a manner that it
takes a bacteriologist to make you
know the difference between the sea
and the dry land. Historical geogra
phy Is ordinary geography with what
ever you don't know about history
added to it Historical geography con
sists of migrations, cedings and other
flora and fauna to suit To make a
historical geography get a few races
and distribute them according to your
fancy over a pink area in various
shades to show how they spread out.
As a matter of fact, they did nothing
of the sort But that makes the his
torical geography all the more Inter
esting. In the hands of schoolteach
ers geographies are frequently believed
in for years by confiding pupils.—Life.
Ballads aa Newspapers.
The ballad, or that form of it which
is associated with the broadside, was
one predecessor of the newspaper as a
commentator on events. It was writ
ten for the people and sold to the peo
ple. Printed on poor paper and passed
from hand to hand, copies of early bal
lads were seldom preserved. Fortu
nately several men of the seventeenth
century began to make collections of
ballads, and the copies of broadsides
printed before 1700 that are now In ex
istence are supposed to number about
10,000. Soon after 1700 the printed
form of the ballad was changed, the
"black letter" disappearing, but the
ballad continued as a chronicler of hap
penings and a commentator on politi
caL military and other public events
until the middle of the nineteenth cen
tury and In the United States as well
as England. The "topical" song of to
day perpetuates the satirical function
of the ballad.—Springfield Republican.
Belgian Kongo.
Belgian Kongo, founded thirty years
ago, is still In the early stage of devel
opment So far practically no manu
facturing Industries have yet been es
tablished, and, aside from the Impor
tant copper mines in the Katanga dis
trict, the only large industrial enter
prises are the railways and river trans
portation services. It may be said that
all business activities in the colony are
devoted to the collection of tropical
products — rubber, ivory, gum copal,
palm oil and kernels, cacao, etc.—and
the railway and river services are In
reality only accessories to these activi
ties, having been established primarily
to aid in the transportation of these
products to the seaports. The gather
ing of rubber In Kongo has never re
covered its former activity, and In all
probability will never again be so rich
a source of Income to the colony as It
was previous to 1912.
Ship Money.
Charles I. was badly in need of mon
ey, and his attorney general In the
course of bis antiquarian researches
discovered that In tbe dim ages of the
past the crown had issued writs to the
cities and towns on the coast requiring
them to provide vessels for the royal
needs, and he suggested that this an
cient right might be brought Into use
again. Instead of the actual vessels a
money contribution might be exacted
Instead. Thus the king would be able
to tax a larger part of the realm while
theoretically observing the laws. Writs
for ship money were accordingly is
sued, bat the patriot John Hampden
declared that they were Illegal and
raised such a protest against them
that they were practically nullified.
Weed Peste.
Of the 200 species of ferns native to
this country a few have become more
or less serious weed pests. Tbe most
troublesome are the hay scented fern
and the brake. According to a bulletin
of the department of agriculture, cut
ting off the tops close to the soil sur
face twice a year for two years will
kill out nearly all ferns. The best
times to do the cutting are just previ
ous to sporing. or about the middle of
June, and the middle of August

Who Is Again a Candidate to Represent
this District as Its Prosecuting Attorney
Servants In Germany
How the servant question is handled
In Germany is told in George Stuart
Fullerton's book, "Germany of Today."
"In Bavaria, if I wish to get rid of
a servant, I must give her notice on
or before the 15th of the mouth, the
notice to take effect on tlie first of the
month following. I must allow the
servant in the two weeks Intervening a
certain number of outings to look for
another place. If I delay my notice
until the 10th I must tolerate the un
welcome domestic for six weeks longer.
Should I prefer to get rid of her at any
price I must pay her, not merely her
wages, but also a sum to cover her
board and lodging up to the legnl date
Such legal provisions may easily be an
annoyance to the employer. It is not
all employees who seem to deserve so
much consideration. But it is surely
better that the well to do should suf
fer some inconvenience than those who
have their daily bread to earn should
run the risk of being brought to dis
tress." _
For Conserving Heat In Pipes.
An excellent covering for steam
pipes may be made from materials
that are always available. Take some
fine sawdust and screen It through a
sieve to remove any foreign bodies.
Prepare a thin paste of flour and wa
ter and mix the sawdust thoroughly
with this paste. With a small trowel
the mixture so prepared should lie ap
plied in about five coats to the steam
pipes while they are slightly warm.
Each coat should be thoroughly dry
before the next is applied. If the
steam pipes are In an exposed situa
tion three or four coats of coal tar
should be applied after the paste has
dried. If Inside a building this water
proofing is unnecessary. Steam pipes
treated with the sawdust as aliove
lose very little heat.—Popular Scienco
Monthly.
