Roman

Catholicism.
We have ba,d the priviledge of
reading from the "Menace" of
July 8, 191ft about one Miss
Elizabeth Scuoffen, who bad
been a siaterof Charity of pro
vidance for 31 years. There is
some few adiiional truths which
we wish to add to what Miss
Schoffen has paid. What she has
said of tbe Roman Catholic
church that is of what we have
read is trne while yet with
those troths, there can be a mis
understanding of those things to'
read, especiajy on the words nuns
andsisters f Charity. There
Is a vast ifference between the
sisters of charity and tbe nuns.
Tho sisters of Charity are prin
cipal nurses. Taking care of
children. And the nunes are
slaves to tee priest nood nuns
are shut up and never fret out to
see any, parti of the world. The
sisters of charity are oat all the
time, and a great portion of Die
time they arj begging for some
thing to support the priest hood
in their folly and wickedness,
A many -uor girl baa- been
lured into the dark prison cells,
there to weep and mourn out their
lives for tbe purpose of satisfying
the demon god of the beastly
nature of characters who hold
them there: those nuns cannot
act as nurses while we do not
doubt the things that Miss
Scboffer has said of Catholicism
we do not understand why Miss
Scboffer has not at all times told
the difference between the nuns
and the sisters of cbar'ty. For
the nuns must be shut up in a
stone building or a place simular
and see no one but tbe old
matron and priest and it they
ever get out they must in some
way breke out. And run away;
it is a fact that the Popp of Rome '
claims to be tbe Vicar of Christ.
And makes his subjects believe
that he is. He makes them be
lieve that be has power to forgive
sins and that he can grant this
power to the bishops and priest
and just for a few dollars the
priests will give absolution to
most any one,
It may be necessary for us to
give tbe reader their own words
on this point as evidence, So
p'ease read.; ?
"So also it cannot be cqualy
true that the pope of Rome is
the Vicar of Jesus Christ on
earth as tbe Catholic religion
teacheo, and that he is antichrist
as they say among the protest
ants." -
We learn" from this language
that protectants claim the pope
to be an anti-christ while the
catholic church claim him to be
tbe Vitar of Christ. But this is
not all we must ask you to read
again.
q. What is the Sacrament of
Order?
A. It is a sacrament by which
spiritual powdr and grace are
given toa Minister of the church
rightly ordained,
Q. What power do tbe Priests
of the church receive through
this sacrament?
A. The Priest receives at his
ordinations: .
1, The power to change the
bread and wine into, the true
Body and Blood of our Saviour
Jesus Christ. ,
2, The power to forgive sins.
(Mission Book page 244.)
The reader must see that the
pope ana priestnooa ci&im a
t i 1 '
mighty power equal to God,
By this claim, they decleve
their lay members. They make
their members believe that they
have power to forgive them of
their sins, that is that they do
it in the place of God, please
read.
' Absolution is the sentence
Dronounced by th e Driest in the
place of God, forgiving the sin
ner who has confessed his sins.
He does what Jesus Christ
would do if he were upon the
earth, For the priest is sent by
Jesus Christ the Son of God.
with the same power to remit
sins with which he himself was
sent by hU heavenly Father,"
(Mission Book. Page 262)
It is true the Priesthood has a
power. But dear reader, it is not
the power to forgive tbe sins of
some other one. We shall say
that it is the mesmeric power
which Saten gives to his ser
vents, inorder for them to deci
eve tbe very Elect with, if it
were possible. This gang above
named has caused darkness on
the earth and gross darkness on
the people. Tbe Pope siting him
self up as tbe Vicar of Christ
has placed himself up in the
seat of the great beast that John
the Revelator saw rise up out of
the sea with seven heads and
, ten horns, And when the second
beast rose up out of t be earth
he made all the world to wonder
after the first beast. This was
accomplished by the two setting
up'the one 'man theory. This
theory is tbe only Image that all
tbe world is under to day, and it
bas brought the world into
gross darkness. And brought
contention, strife and division,
in every manner. Which can be
sooken of it is wbat is separa
ting man and wife it makes the
bloody battlelield. It is tbe bone
of contention here on earth

Dear Cresset Editor and
Friends, Seams like our Cor
respondent is like the violin, for
I notice, that it makes no differ
ence bow good a violin it may
seem to be, some time during:
the day it will get out of tune.
And it makes no difference
how good and honerable a chris
tian some men may seem to be,
they get out of tune with God,
For the land lords of Iowa of
to day," Come here 85 years ago,
bought land for 10 to 15 dollars
per acre: Went to town in lum
ber wagons, they hired' men
work all summer and had to walk
their shoe soles off, it they got
their wages in the fall,
And today the same land is
worth 225 dollars per acre, And
they go to town In Automobiles
with the latest improvements on
it, So you don't have to orank
it any more. And you own from
two to 21 sections of land and
have moved off to town to take
life easy, and you have from 10
to 100 renters on your land, and
you receive from $1200,00 to
$2000.00 from each renter per .
year cash money,
Why do you Hon, Christiana
do this?.,- It is because yon lova
darkness rather than light, and
we know your deeds are evil.
You may tell us that feeding
cattle and hogs, is a gambling
scheme to keep us from trying
it. and of course that sound
pretty good under the one man
theory. You can profess Chris
tianity, be a big man and go to
church. But under the two men
theory you can't be a christian
and gamble on the Board-of-trade.
Why can't you he b good to
the Renter, as others was to you
sell your land for tbe renter.
Why can't you do as they did in
days of the apostles' When they
had all things common,'
The renters cash mony he now
pay 8 you wi'l keep you just the
same? And he can pay for him
a nice home. Which now will
you choose, sell your land, aa
they did in the days of tbe A-
or keep your land that
God put here for all. And reap a
rich portion through the fieMs of
Labor. And pile up treasure
for your Last days, which will
be a cur se to you in the day
of judgement. Chnoso this
day the right. And make peace
with God of the universe.
