"No federal quarantine has been es

is likely to be," said Dr. Hanks. "Wc
expect to control the epidemic so well
it will not be neeessarv. I now have
18 assistants who are here, or on the

to take care of our end of the work.
All these men konw their business

Deutschland Expected to Leave
Baltimore at Any Hour
CARGO
ALREADY LOADED
Crew Apparently Anxius Knowing that
Enemy Warships Are in
Waiting
Baltimore. July 19. At 11 o'clock
tonight the two spars of the German
merchant submarine were taken down
and the conning tower closed. Close
at hand lay the tug Thomas F. Tim
mina with a full head of steam up.
In the vicinity of the submarine
were many launches with agents of
tii Kaestern Forwarding company ami
patrols aboard. These craft at 11.05
i c clock, hailed a newsnaner launch
and tried to induce the reporters to
leave.
"You're interfering with our plans,"
the watchman said.
Because of the storm off IT the capes,
which has driven the waiting warships
Of England far to sea, it is believed the
undersea boat may make a dash be
fore morning. .
To all appearances the Deutehlaiid
was ready to leave at any tlina. Its
full crew was snld to be aboard.
Among the late events that tended
to confirm this belief was the stowing
of more than forty tons of fuel oil on
the submarine, late this afternoon. An
official interested in the submarine's
activities, earlier in the day, sought to
create the impression that the two
tank cars of oil that had been run
on the pier where the Deutschland was
bi it bed were intended lor the second
submarine merchantman that is ex
peeled here in the near future.
1 he Stevedores, who have been
worKing day ami nignt ror nearly a
week putting aboard the return cargo
of rubber and nickel, were discharged
this afternoon two hours before the
usual time for the day shift to quit
All shore leave for the crew of the
Deutschland was stopped tonight. Ac
cording to stories told by friends ot
some of the submarine's seamen, tho
latter have expressed deepest anxiety
over the possibility of their falling
(ietims to the allied cruisers, reported
to be awaiting the submersible off the
capes not from cannon but from (lis
abled engines through being caught in
nets which they believe will lie
stretched for them.
"Kntangled in these, the submarine
cannot escape." a friend of the men
was Quoted as saying tonight. "Its
engines will be crippled and It will be
a slow and agonizing death to all on
board. When the engines stop, tin
lights will go out and the air will
stop. That is what the men fear.
They talk of it continually while alon
and they ask everyone to pray for
them.'
Ibis same man said the Deutscfa
land's crew expressed fears that tb
liremeii might meet the fate they had
pictured as a Hi8sibility to tlietn
selves.

Berlin Admits Russians Are Close
to Hungarian Frontier
RUSSIAN LOSSES ARE HEAVY
Ground In Front of Austrian Trenches
Covered with Bodlea Cut Down
by Infantry Fire
London, July 19. The Russian mili
tary critics dwell on what they do
scribe as "the mechanical regularity"
of the strategic and tactical blows
dealt by Russia on her various fronts
and the absence of any indications
that the enemy forces are able effec
tively to parry them. The recent Rub
sian successes have brought them
much nearer Viadimir-Yolynski and
Kovel, and the German communlca
ions between Kovel and Lemberg are
threatened b ythe advance to Stoyan
off and Sokal, prelimnary to the in
vestment of Lemberg.
In Transylvania the Russians have
secured two important eastern passes
in the Carpathians, Japlonitza and Kir
libaba. while they also hold command
of the Delatyn-Uudapest Railway.
Their cavalry is moving in the rear of
General Pflanzer's forces between
Klmpolung and Kuty, and apparently
the invasion of Hungary has begun.
Berlin. July 19. (via London.)
Reports from the southeastern front in
dicate that the Russians, after a fort
night of comparative inactivity, have
hi ought up heavy reinforcements of in
fantry and cavalry ond have now re
sumed a strong aggressive on the
headwaters of the Moldava near the
Hungarian frontier.
A change in the weather has facili
tated the operations, after clear hot
weather in which it was impossible
to conceal the movements of troops
for sudden attacks in great force. The
Russians are showing the utmost ten
acity and their artillery is playing an
important part in the operations.
The Austrian mountain batteries,
however, have achieved splendid re
sults against it. The Russians pre
part only hasty Held jiositlons, believ
ing that the Austrian resistance can
ioon be broken,, but the reports say
the Austrian infantry is Withstanding
all the attacks and filling the ground
in front of tho trenches with Russian
dead.

Earl W. Williams of the Bennington
garage and J. C. Reed and A. J. Palmer
of Dorset arrived in the village with
the busses from Springfield. Mass.,
about 3 o clock Wednesday afternoon.
Messrs Reed and Palmer have been
engaged to drive the busses.
The chassis for the busses wera
built by the Thomas Jeffrey Co., Keno
sha, Wis., which makes a speciality of
trucks and ears used for other pur
poses than touring. The Jeffrey com
pany does not manufacture tops for
its cars for the reason that so many
different styles are demanded. This
feature of the business put the bus
line company In a position In which
it was compelled to purchase its out
fit from two different concerns and the
tops had to be built to order.
After the chassis had been pur
chased they were shipped from.
Kenosha to Springfield where the bod
i .wre built to order by the George
Smith Plumbing and Auto Metal com
pany. Before placing the order for the tops
ine ous line company searciiea mu
country' for a concern which was in a
position to complete the cars in a
short space of time and the oflieera
feel that they have reason for self
congratulation In locating a concern
that would take the contract and deliv
er the goods so quickly. In four
weeks after the stock for the bus Una
company was sold the cars are on tho
ground ready for business.
The busses are much neater in ap
pearance than many of the cars used
for a similar purpose. They will ac
commodate 15 passongers and tho drlv
er and an extra passenger may be car
ried in ease of necessity. The seats
are made with high backs and comfort
ably upholstered. The cars are paint
ed In black with a gold lettered Una
"Bennington-Dorset Ahto Bus Line
Inc." just above the top of the side
curtains. Forty horse power engines
under the hoods will easily carry the
cars over all grades to bo encountered
on the route.
Tills afternoon the cars will both run
to Dor.si t. v. heto one is to remain over
night The other will return to Den
nlngton for the Initial trip tomorrow
morning.
