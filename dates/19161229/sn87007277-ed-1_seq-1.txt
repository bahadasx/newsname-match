Arras has been called the most poig
nantly saddening memorial of the pres
ent war. I have visited many devastated
areas in two trips to the British front
this year, during which I have had an
opportunity to skirt most of the line
held by King George's armies. I have
Just visited Arras and I acquiesce in
the belief that it brings home the
cruelties of war more than any town
jr city which I have heretofore visit
ed. I have tried to Imagine myself an
American tourist and Arras as one of
the memorials kept as it is for the
view of the whole world, writes Joseph
W. Grigg in the New York World.
I "In ten years' time pilgrimages to It
would amass to the French enough
money to build another Arras," was
the comment of one of my companions
as we passed through Its streets.
Hardly a house In the place but
what has suffered from the German
boinbnrdments, especially the fierce
bombardment of January and Febru
ary, 1915. Where shells have not done
actual damage, concussion has. In the
cellars a few families still reside, de
spite the shells which fitfully are
"lobbed over" by the Germans.
1 Arras might have been fought over
yesterday, for pieces of shell and
other paraphernalia of war are still
In evidence through Its thoroughfares.
A Century-Old Prison.
We went Into one building where,
only very recently, have been found
scribbled on the walls the names of a
number of Englishmen who were kept
there in prison little more than a cen
tury ago. They were : John Ellis, pris
oner of war, 1806-1810; William Mill,
William Wheatley and Thomas Al
oeson, prisoners of war, 1809-1810;
John Jemlson, prisoner of war, August,
1806, and John Jones, prisoner of war,
December, 1803.
1 If battlefields are already being
leased for tourist purposes, what a
profitable project it would be for some
pi these forehanded speculators If
they could only obtain an option on
Arras, grewsome as the thought of
nch profit-making Is when the war is
till before Its very doors.

Rome. Tutt' Ali is the name of
Italy's youngest battleship. The name
means "All Wings," and It Is not bad
ly chosen, for this ship dashes through
the ocean at the rate of the fastest
train that speeds across America. The
inventors are in the Italian navy, and
she was built In Italian shipyards with
Italian machinery and of Italian steel.
The Inventors' names, the ship's ton
nage, its present whereabouts, are all
a dead secret But the fact remains
that "All Wings" in her trial trip did
800 miles at three times the rate of
the fastest transatlantic ship.
"During the trip," says an officer,
"we were attacked by an enemy sub
marine. You would have laughed to
see the torpedo fall several hundred
yards clear of our stern, for we went
so quick that no torpedo now being
used could touch us. The torpedo
catchers which escorted us were left
far behind. In a few minutes all we
saw of them was a bit of smoke."
Tills ship has stood her trials so
well that more are in the stocks. Tutt'

cling to the ruing of their home, find
time for laughter. This woman asked
if we were not afraid we would be
torpedoed In making the cross-channel
trip. It was suggested that the
submarines were no such menace as
frequent bombardment. She smiled
and said the cellars were quite safe
during such times and, anyway, they
were getting used to It
On one of the main thoroughfares
we stopped to have an open-air lunch
eon. We sat and chatted In this
street which In ordinary times was
one of the most creditable In the city.
Our conversation was the only thing
to disturb Its ghastly solemnness ex
cept the rustling of tree leaves and
the Intermittent shell fire going on
within a few hundred yards of the
outskirts of the place. Across the
road a tin sign was flapping In the
breeze, the only reminder of a once
prosperous business. The sign was
there but the building had practically
been demolished.
It was with no sense of regret that
we left Arras and gazed once more on
open fields, fields dominated by Ger
man guns but being worked by old
men, women and children.
As neither coal nor naphtha could
be stored In large enough quantities
to enable Tutt' All to travel at such
a rate, the inventors had recourse to
a combination of naphtha and com
pressed air. The naphtha passes
through compressed air at such a ter
rific rate that It emerges In a state of
pulverization ; It is then propelled Into
so-called boilers by means of ntmos
pherlc pressure, thus producing heat
of from 1,500 to 1,800 degrees centi
grade. Tuft' All has three turbines,
which propel with a force of 8,400
horse power each.
Terrific Speed.
The result Is the terrific speed at
tained and the general effect of a
phantom ship. The safety valves
throw off showers of water and pul
verized naphtha, which turn bright
purple In the sun as they fly upward.
The ship shakes as though It were In
a perpetual earthquake. Even hard
ened seamen have to learn to walk
on Tutf All. The steel lining would
break with the vibration but for a
special system of Joints. The noise
of the turbines Is so great that no
body's voice can be heard. All orders
are given by signal, as in the midst
of a heavy bombardment The ship
leaves a high mountain of sea behind
her.
Those who were able to take the
first trip of 800 miles said It was very
stirring and an experience they would
not have missed for anything In the
world. But there is no comfort about

EXPERT ADVICE TO GOLFERS
Learn to Walk Up to Your Ball and
Hit It Naturally Master First
Principles of Game.
It has been claimed that golfers who
fall to drive consistently can attribute
their shortcoming to not having suffi
ciently mastered the first principles.
If those have been learned, the golfer
should walk up to his ball and bit it
naturally, and the body must be so
trained that all parts of the stroke are
performed more or less automatically.
Until a golfer has thoroughly familiar
ized himself with the strokes used and
brought them under his control he can
not play well. On the other hand, It
is a dangerous practice to think of
them constantly or to analyze every
stroke you make. If you do, the con
scions effort to do one particular thing
will have Just the opposite effect on
the rest of your stroke. Practice your
shots until they become a natural part
of your swing and then the rest will
come easy enough. Sporting Life.

NEW ATHLETE.
The following lis from an article in
Association Men, contributed by L. C.
Relmann, left tackle In the University
of Michigan :
The day of the "bottle-scarred" hero
Is gone, and the new type of athlete Is
taking his place. The first question
the student body asks of a football
hero is : "Do you drink?" His pop
ularity will hang upon bis general
manner of living. All the best coaches
and trainers in the country absolute
ly forbid drinking of intoxicants dur
ing the training season and keep a
watchful eye on their men the year
round. The first Infraction of the- rule
against drinking Is dealt with harsh
ly by the coach and athletic directors.
The second means unqualified dis
missal from the squad. This has been
found the only way to deal with such
cases, for Coach "Hurry-Up" Yost says
he has no time to waste trying to
train a drinker, and nothing tries a
man's staying powers Kke football.
While the old type of athlete is pass
ing out, the "new athlete" is coming
in rapidly and is aligning himself in
the fight for dry territory. He Is typ
ified by such men as Jack Watson,
captain of the Illinois football team
and president of the Y. M. C. A.;
"Cub" Buck, captain of the Wisconsin
football team and president of the
Y. M. C. A.; Rutherford, the football
tar and president of the University
of Nebraska Y. M. C. A.; Mike Dori
zas, University of Pennsylvania, cham
pion strong man of the East and all
round athlete ; Hobson of Yale, Brick
ley of Harvard, and hundreds of the
foremost athletes of the United States.
Such men are forming a line of offense
against booze and all forms of dissipa
tion, because they know that no man
jean combine drink and good playing.
Eddie Collins, the White Sox star,
says: "You can't bat .300 if you bat
around all night," and one of his ten
commandments to young athletes is:
"Don't drink alcoholic drinks." Con
pie Mack, manager of the Philadel
phia Athletics, said In 1910 of the
.team which won the world's baseball
championship, that 15 of the 25 play
ers "did not even know the taste of
liquor," and predicted that In five
years 00 per cent of all baseball play
ers would be strictly temperate.
SALOON AND WORKINGMAN.
Saloon politicians nre the wonft ene
mles of the laboring man's rights.
They get plenty of money to buy free
beer and whisky to debauch the electo
rate. They raise the cry of "personal
liberty," and with solid saloon support,
the honest worklngman has no show
against them.
The saloon fills workhouses and pen
itentlarles with Its victims, and their
labor Is brought Into competition with
free labor, to the injury thereof.
The saloon is labor's worst enemy.
The sooner working men realize the
fact, the better It will be for them.
The corrupt politician thrives through
the saloon and corrupt politicians are
bleeding this country to death, bring
ing It down to conditions of older and
less resourceful countries. The abol
Ishment of the saloons will not bring
labor Immediately all that labor ought
to have, but It will be the removing
of the greatest obstacle to labor's
success.
The working people of the United
States earned more money each year
for the distillery and brewery kings
of America than was paid to all the
kings and emperors of Europe.
Working people are now asserting
their rights and are freeing themselves
from slavery to the Inhuman liquor
traffic and the dominance of an aris
tocracy of beer. John F. Cuuneen, La
bor Leader, Chicago.

TEXT-How much then Is a man at
more value than a sheepT-Matt. 12:11.
Is a man worth saving? Should 'In

tist exhorted the
men of Ms gene
ration to do, or -should
Christian'
people try to save
unsaved men
about them? Sal

whether of the
forest or the
rainfall, game In
the water or on
land, or the ua-
used powers of
nature all around
us; but is not man
worth more than
these?
In a recent religious periodical there
was a picture of a drove of animals
being driven through a passage In a.
stock yard. In connection with the pic
ture was a verse of poetry, describing
these as going to the slaughter with
out a care, without a dream of death,
without a quickened breath, all un
knowing, and the last words of the
verse were these: "And these are
sheep." There was another picture of
young men marching along a cltjj
street They were in civilian clothes.
but each carried a bundle as if going
on some very uncertain Journey. They,
were described as smiling to cover
hearts that faltered. They knew their
fate; they were touched with fear and
hate. They were recruits going to the
slaughter, too, and the last words of
the verse were : "And these are men."
No, not only In the days of our Lord,
but in these day the question may,
be asked, "Is a man better than a
sheep?"
Popular Estimate,
A man is worth more than a sheep
In dollars and cents. In the days of
slavery In this country a strong negro
man would fetch more In the market
than a sheep. Today if a man Is killed
by a public conveyance, more can be
recovered on his life than on the life
of a sheep. The higher valuation is
largely because Intellectually man Is
far above a sheep. Whatever may be
the intellectual power of a horse or
a dog, certainly a sheep Is considered
the least Intellectual of all animals.
Man has a moral nature of which the
sheep Is apparently absolutely devoid ;
his spiritual nature puts him far above
any animal. His spiritual nature in
a sense suggests Immortality, for when
he dies his spirit goes to God who gave
It while that of a sheep goes down.
Man's Estimate of Himself.
But what seems to be man's esti
mate of himself as compared with a
sheep? To preserve a sheep Is to pro
serve perishable property or material
Interests. To preserve himself, his.
whole being, Is to preserve his spirit
ual and Immortal Interests. How is a
man acting at that point? Is he not
giving more time, thought and labor
to the things that perish than to the
things that endure? Does the Bible
get as deep Interest as the morning
paper? Is the house of worship or
prayer attended as enthusiastically as
a place of amusement? Is the thought
of making the world better as Insistent
as that of pleasing himself?
Man seems to be quite enthusiastic
In the propagation of sheep, spending
money without stint and giving thought
and time to the subject, but how
rarely does he consider the propaga
tion of the right kind of men.
God's Estimate of Man.
Whnt Is God's estimate of man? Did
he not create him In his own Image
and likeness? Someone has said man,
is the paragon of creation. God did
not do so with sheep. It is true that
everything in creation was good, but
no creature was in the likeness of God
except man. God made full provision
for the preservation of his own like
ness, making man's environment moat
congenial to such preservation, and
when man demanded liberty of moral
choice, God presented the strongest
possible plea for obedience. When man
fell, God still held before him taws of
easy performance and connected with
them the fairest promises of blessing.
For centuries, while man would fall
away from God, God followed him up
most patiently and lovingly. When
at last man would not heed the most
loving call to moral rectitude, God
gave his only begotten Son to die for
him, and for nineteen centuries the
salvation of Jesus Christ has been of
fered to man without money and wltbx
out price. And to return to the figure
of the sheep, Jesus Christ stands ready
to be a spiritual shepherd to any meA
who will come Into bis told.
