CHICAGO, Dec. 29.—'Record-break

sources published by the Railway
Age Gazette today' in Its annual re

The increased earnings have been
followed Immediately, It Is set forth,
by increased expenses for equipment
and extentlon. Locomotive and car
builders have received large orders
for equipment for export as well as
for domestic delivery. During the
year 170,000 freight cars were order

2,349 passenger cars and 2,920 loco

PARIS, Dec. 29.—A sudden German

French screen of infantry and ma

EL PASO, Texas, Dec. 29.—After

thousand pesos on the city, "Villa has
evacuated Torreon and is now on the
march toward Saltillo, according to
reports given out by Carranza mili

"While in Torreon, Villa was care

admitted that the garrison at Saltillo
had evacuated the town last week,
leaving it unprotected, while the gar

In United States official quarters
here, doubt was expressed that Villa

Diplomatic Quandry.
I By Carl D. Groat, United Press Staff
Correspondent.

WASHINGTON. Dec., 29.—The Am
erican government today found itself
in a diplomatic quandry over Mexican
matters.
It had to decide whether to stay by
its guns and tell Carranza that the
American-Mexican peace commission
is ended in view of his failure to sign
the troop withdrawal protocol, or
whether to relax from a recently Arm
position and yield to his futher im
portunate appeal for modification of
the agreement.
The last word, before he answered
demands for signing was substantially
this:
"We have put in three months fram
ing this protocol. It represents our
best efforts. We cannot alter it. Yon
must answer by December 2G."
In substance, Carranza has failed
wholly to live up to thsee demands.
His answer Is so framed that its words
are intended to mollify the American
government and it appeals for a little
more change.
The American commissioners are
scheduled to meet soon to consider it.
Then there will be a Joint session at
which their answer will be presented
and if the temper of the American side
has not cooled, the answer, some here
believe, will be "we are done with
peace negotiations."

Railway Brotherhoods to Have

Again.
BY SPECIAL CIRCULAR
Secret Conference of Leaders Decides
to Put Matter Up to the
Men for Ac
tion.
[United' Press Leased Wire Service.]
NEW YORK, Dec. 29.—The entire
situation raised by the Adamson
eight hour law and thb test case now
in the supreme court will be outlined
to the membership of the four railway
brotherhoods in a special circular to
be Issued soon, brotherhood heads an
nounced here this afternoon.
Announcement of the intention to
take the entire question back to the
brotherhood members was made fol
lowing a secret conference of lead
ers.
The statement was signed by Act
ing President Sheppard of the railway
conductors W. G. Lee, president of
the trainmen W. S. Stone, chief of
the locomotive engineers W. F. Car
ter, president of the brotherhood of
locomotive firemen and engineers.
The statment follows:
While meeting with President
Wilson last August at his insist
ence. our commission waived
their request for time and a half
over time, which was fully fifty
per cent of their original demand,
and at the suggestion of the pres
ident accepted his proposition,
which was:
Concession of eight hour day
postponement of the other de
mands as to payment for over
time and the other suggestions
of the railway managers until ex
perience had fully disclosed the
consequences of the eight hour
day.
In the meantime the constitu
tion, by authority of congress, of
a commission or body of men, ap
pointed by the president to ob
serve and invest igatfe and record
upon these consequences, were
also recommended.
In so doing they would secures
the eight hour basis they had
won. But the enactment, of the
Adamson eight hour law, effective
January 1, 1917, made it neces
sary for them to wait -patiently
until that time, to find later that
the railroad companies instituted
injunction proceedings against
government enforcement of the
eight hour. law. At this time
the entire matter is in litigation,
such litigation making it impossi
ble for the single committee ap
pointed by the president as pro
vided for in the law to proceed
with their investigation as of

Reversion to Secret Diplomacy
Is Charged by Three Sena
tors Who Want to Know
What's Doing.
NO CONFERENCES HELD
Committee on Foreign Relations Has
No Ides What Is Belnfl Done
In Country's International
Affairs.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
WASHINGTON, Dec. 29.—Three
United States senators today de
nounced the recent handling of this
country's International affairs as a
reversion to secret diplomacy. They
declared that not only have recent
matters been hedged about with sec
recy as far as the public 1b concern
ed, but that even the senate foreign
relations committee has not been
given opportunity to know "what Is
going on.' These senators who thus
voiced disapproval of this govern
ment's methods in handling the coun
try's foreign affairs, are Polndexter
of Washington state, Weeks of Mas
sachusetts and Sutherland of Utah.
"My understanding is that the
present administration has declared
Itself an ardant foe to secret diplom
acy," said Polndexter. "In practice,
however, it has shown itself a past
master in the art of mystery and
concealment.
"There are veiled rumors of secret
policies affecting the vital Interests
of the country which the president
will commit to us without consulting
us. There Is even a debate of pub'ic
men as to the ultimate extreme Units
of the constitutional powers of the
present to set aside the Monroe doc
trine, for instance:
"To enter into league of peace
or agree to .lo so: or to commit the
country to that policy without tne
advice and consent of the senate.
"What is more important is
*r.at
these great movements are taken
without the advice and coment of
public opinion which is supposed to
be the governing factor in a democ
facy such as this.
"It is far better than secret
diplomacy in so far as vital policies
are concerned should be done away
with forever.
"Sunlight and the open air are the
great disinfectants In the world and
would tend to a wholesome conduct
of our foreign affairs."
"I am at a loss to account for the
secret moves being made by the ad
ministration." Senator Weeks said.
"It. places the people in an embarras
sing position. After a step is taken
I the people are compelled to support
the president, even though they -nsv
have different oinions concerning the
matter."
"The president formerly conferred
with the committee on foreign rela
tions on matters of this character,
I said Senator Sutherland, "about
three years ago, when the Mexican
I situation was foremost in public in
terest, he suddenly stopped these
conferences. Ho is not obliged to
confer with anyone, but greater re
sults could be obtained by the ild
method, I am sure."

'This new outrage hag been com

other members of the organization,
were deported. At Libramont, twenty
one employes of the national relief
commission were deported.
"During a slave raid at Arlon. forty
three emploves of the local regional
agencies of the relief commission were
among 40 men taken to Germany.
"This suffices to prove that when
the German authorities defend their
policy of deportations on the ground
that they are thus checking unemploy

"Would the United States act pub

which It handles between the bellig

held here.
