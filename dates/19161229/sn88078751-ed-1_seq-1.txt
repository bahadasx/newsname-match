HEALTH INSURANCE
Address of Head of Association
For Labor Legislation.
Columbus. Dec 28. "At present
the United States has tho unenviable
distinction of being the ouly grov
industrial nation without compulsor7
health insurance," Professor lrvinr .
Fisher, of Yale university, declared Id
his presidential address before the ,
American Association for Labor Los-'
elation here.
"For a generation the enllghtene-i
Mtions of Europe have, one after an
other, dlscuersed the fdea and follow
ed the discussion by adoption. It as
constituted an important part, of the
jpillcyrpnd career of some of Europe's
greatest statesmen, including Bis

lei industrial progress since that
time, her comparative freedom from
poverty, reduction lu the death rate

physical -preparedness of her soldier;
are presumably due, in considerable
measure, to health insurance.
"Health Insurance will afford a
very powerful and pervasive stimulus
to employers, employes and public
en to take fuller and speedier ad
vantage of possible health saving 'le
vines. One Important effect will be
the prolongation of the workman's

German Policy Outlined.
The German policy upon which the
totiIv to President Wilson's communi
cation is based, was outlined as fol
:ows- "Geimany reels that the ccn
ierencc suggested by it first should be
composed of delegates from the bel
lltroront countries, whose duty it
wonM bo to settle territorial terms.
"If tho terms are agreed upon the
1 enresentatives of thebe neutrals
should be called in to participate In
th luestion of guarantees for the fu
ture, In which neutrals are as vltallv
concerned as belligerents. These
guarantees. In the German view, noc

tration," Germany is said to consider that
nentral nations can have no interest
of their own in terms such as those

While there were no official advice
upon the subject, the view xtlll per.
fists in Gorman quarter that tho
note of tho central powers might be
followed by some highly confidential
oral or written communication to
President WllBon, In which at least
broad tentative terms -might be lndl.
ented.
It is certain ofllcials noted with In
terest Berlin press dispatches saying
that mbossador Gerard, who as a re
mit ot his Tecent visit to the United
State-; is thoroughly familiar with the
-iews of President Wilson, had taken
lunch with Alfred Ziruroermann, the
German foreien minister, and prob
ably discussed the peace situation
with him.

the answer may be dispatched by tb

of the entente, although agreed Id

New York, Dec. 28. Tho national

the four brotherhoods of railroad em
ployes resumed their meetings hei
today 'or the announced purpose ?
arriving at some agreement as te
-.he application of the Adamson law Iv.
the evert it Is held to be constltutlci
al by the United States supremo
court. The meetings had teen adjourneft
to await the handing down of the
award 1 tho case of the switchmen's'
arbitration, which, it wa expectwZ.
might have some bearing upon th
eventual Interpretation of the Adaca
son act.
It was Intimated in railroad circtea
that among other things which wonkE
he considered was an agreement Uisi
would bring the two forces togethev
in a concerted effort to fight ta
president's' proposed compulsory srbiKt
tratlon legislation.
The railroads, however, are not a&.
together opposed to the principal (f
compulsory arbitration, it was Indi
cated, provided a suitable plan cxa Km
evolved looking toward the selection
of the arbitrators.
Both sides are confident that .v
mutual understanding will be roaefcr',

out, specifies the hours of labor Sua
does not make provisions for the en
forcement or continuation or eert&e,

in this regard, it was stated thai bath:
sides, after agreeing pn as miss
points as possible, would consent
