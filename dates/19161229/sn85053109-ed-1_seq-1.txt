SUBJECT IN REPLY TO U. S.
Secretary Lansing's Two Statements
Which Caused Flurry After Wil
son's Note Was Dispatched, Ar«
Cabled Abroad So As To Em
phasize President's Attitude.
.Washington, Dec. 26.—Nothing of
flcial has come from Europe to show
when the belligerents will reply to
President Wilson's note urging dis
cusslon of peace, or what the natura
of the responses may be. The Lou
don news dispatches indicating as
early reply was unlikely because ol
the necessity of consultation between
the Allies agreed with the view pre
vailing here.
It is thought here that the Allies
might not make extended answer tc
the proposals of the'Central powers :
but would deal with the whole peac«
subject in their response to the Unit
ed States.
Apparently the administration, hav
ing dispatched the note and in the in
terest of caution having taken stepa
to see that no misconstruction abroad
was placed on the President's purpose,
now Is carefully watching the expres
sions of opinion, particularly In thf
British press.
Hostile Views Moderated.
As the attitude of the Teutonic Al
lies had been clearlv foreshadowed la
advance and the President, in the note,
specifically disclaimed any associa
tion with that attitude, the interest ol
American officials centered on the re
ception of the note In the Allied coun
tries and among the European neu
trals.
It was recalled, as the London dis
patches, most of them hostile, arrived,
that similar expressions greeted the
original proposals of the Central Al
lies, but that the views were moderat
ed In the British press and among the
Allied diplomats here after reflection
and discussion.
Lansing's Statements Cabled.
To preclude any possibility of mis
construction of the President's pur
poses from the flurry of Thursday
caused by Secretary Lansing's two
•tatements, both were cabled to Amer
ican diplomats abroad in neutral, as
well as belligerent countries, so they
might be prepared to state correctly
the President's attitude toward the
governments to which they are accred
ited. They are intended to offer of
ficial evidence, if it be needed, that
the President's note is exactly what
it purports to be on Its face.
The suggestion from London that
the manner of replying to the Prest
lent's note will differ from the form
it replies to proposals of the German
Allies corresponded with official er
lactations.
Relations With Germany Improved.
The German view here Is that what
ever the reply of the Allies the rela
tions between Germany and the Unit
ed States will have been immeasurably
Improved, probably to the point of as
suring careful steps by the Berlin gov
ernment to avoid any such conditions
is lead up to a crisis which threat
ened a break in diplomatic relations.
That view which holds the advantage
>f comity with the greatest of neutrals
will be so forcibly Impressed upon the
people of the Central empires that It
will not again be endangered.
Note Accepted In Good Faith.
Allied diplomats, while they appar
ently had decided to accept the Presi
dent's attitude In good faith had not
wholly disposed of their fear that tt
might rebound to the advantage ol
their enemies. It was reiterated in all
jfficlal quarters that therö Is perfect
understanding between Secretary Lan
sing and the President and whatever
might have appeared as discord in In
terpretation of the note to tJhe bellig
erents had been disposed of by the
baue of the Secretary's second state
ment and the steps to Inform the for
eign governments of the facts.

Mere Man Made
Merry at Dance
Cut Bank girls had their last
opportunity to assert their Leap
year privileges last evening,
when Mere Man was taken
gently by the hand and march
ed into the Electric Hall, where
he either shone resplendently
on the polished dance floor or
languished helplessly on a side
seat, supinely or enviously
watching his more fortunate
fellow male being lionized by
the winsome girls and matrons.
And what is most im
portant: Mere man was dined
and "punched" at Hotel Great
Northern. That is, he was
treated to a sumptuous (as the
wedding writer editor would
say) repast and as a chaser was
treated to pink punch with a
mild kick in it.
The Mere Men, whether lion
ized or neglected, all praised
the ladies fulsomely for the
way they managed the last
Leapyear dance. It was a lit
tle different, had a little more
snap and gayety—and best
of all the best—.ilare Man
didn't pav a cent.

Go Slow
At the recent farmers'
gathering at Billings a reso
lution was adopted favoring
the nonpartisan idea, such
as the one that swept North
Dakota in the recent elec
tion. Might it not be well
for Montana farmers to
await the workings of the
nonpartisan government in
the neighbor state. There
the governorship and legis
lature are controlled by the
new organization and its
workings will be unhinder
ed. Experience has taught
that a new name does not
always change the form or
spirit of a thing. It is not
possible that the suave pro
fessional politicians of the
old parties will slip in quiet
ly and take charge of the
works of the Nonpartisan
League? It is well to re
member that Senator Fred
Whiteside of Flathead, one
of the "slickest" politicians
in Montana, was in the
meeting at Billings when
this resolution was adopted
and we heard no dissenting
note from him.
This is not written with
the intention of discourag
ing or discrediting the non
partisan movement, but to
counsel deliberation before
rushing into it. Let's watch
the outcome in North Da
kota before getting excited.

Shelby to Have a
Bigger Plant
On the 20th of this month a
new $5000.00 electric light plant
was shipped out of Chicago by
James A. Johnson for Shelby.
The new plant will be the best
obtainable and will be capable
of supplying the entire town
with service.
A new light house will be
constructed back of the present
one and will be a great im
provement over the old plant.
The service of street lights
has been extended across the
track as announced would be
done some time ago. It was a
fine brightening up that the
light gave in front of the Sul
livan hotel on Tuesday night.
A number of homes and all
the streets of the town will
be lighted up with the new ser
vice and wires are being strung
in many new sections of the
town. This is a material im
provement for Shelby, espec
ially the street lights, which
were needed very much.—
Shelby Promoter.
The electric lighting system
ia Sweet Grass was out of
working order for a short time
last week, says the Advocate,
and pandemonium reigned in
the business places and homes.
The Sweet Grass people realiz
ed how valuable an asset the
lighting system is and could
not be induced to return to the
of lighting. Practically every
home and business place in
town has become a patron of
the system, the Advocate savs.

Teachers and pupils of the

a good vacation during the
holidavs and are anticipating
entering upon the new year
with refreshed vitalitv and vi
gor.
The entertainment given last
Friday evening was heartily
enjoyed by a l?rge assemblage,
mostly made up of "proud par
ents" of the youthful hi trionics
who performed clever turns
in pantomime, declamation, ac
robatics and singing. To make
individual comment might
arouse the ire of some proud
parent whose hopeful failed of
flattering eulogy, so the Pio
neer Press will court diplomacy
by stating that the entertain
ment was high class and the
painstaking teachers as well as
the pupils, from the high school
students to the tiny tots, are
deserving of much commenda
tion.
