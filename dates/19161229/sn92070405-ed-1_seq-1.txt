READERS AND ADVERTISERS
Readers of the Liberal expect to
deal with tho advertisers who make
their paper possible.
Advertisers in tho Liberal expect
the patronage of its readers because
they make it possible t? produce and
sell the paper for the Utile it costs.
If it were not for tha cdvertisers
the Liberal and other publications
would cost about four times as much.
All things bcinf equal, readers of
the Liberal do nst hesitate to deal
with its advjrtisers.
But the latter must makj n noise
like live merchants.
There isn't a mail-order house In
tho world that can build up Lords
burg. And let that sink in, please.

The Western Liberal is in receipt
of a communication from W. S. Cox,
Well known Silver City business man
and chairman of tho road committee
of the Silver City Chamber of Com
merce, relative to tho encouragement
in this region of n . petition to the
county commissioners for the purpose
that an election might be ordered to
determine whether rr not road and
bridge bonds to tho nmount of $300,
000 be authorized and :ssued.
Grant 'county, with an assessed val
uation this year of over $24,000,000,
is allowed to bond itself to a maxi
mum of 4 per cent, or approximately
$900,000. The outstanding bonded
and floating debt o ;ho county is
about $300,000. The voting of $300.
000 additional in bonds for road build
ing would increase this to $G00,-
000.00, leas than tho maximum allowed
by law.
The road bond issue proposed would
run for 20 years and draw 5 per cent
interest, which would increase the tax
rate about $1.25 on each $1,000 of
nroperty in the county. Thus it ii
seen that the burden would be so
slight as to be scarcely noticed by the
taxpayers.
The law provides that in order tc
secure the calling of an election tc
vote on bonds, 10 per cent of tht
nualified voters must sign the peti
tions. Thus approximately 400 name:
only would be necessary.
Thereupon the petitions would bt
presented to the board of counts
commissioners, which would revise the
signatures on tho petitions nnd, il
satisfied that these were bonafide
would within 60 days and not less
than 90 days issue n proclamation
calling an election, giving tho voten
of the entire county an opportunity
of expressing their will at the polls
on the proposition.
Grant county, ranking a very closf
second to Colfax, the richest counh
in the state in assessed valuation, ha;
one of the poorest road systems in the
itate. Tho need of better roads haf
long been recognised as an absolut
necessity, but the funds available a!
present make their construction m
possible.
The bond issue propose! would
pave the way fur tito building of a
network of good road in t' oso sec
for? of the county where tho traflU
demands improved highways and
would return to ths taxpayers thou
sands of dollars in indirect revenue.
What can be done with adequate
funds for road building has beer
demonstrated by the new Silver City
Tyrone road, built during the past
few months by the state at an ex
pense of nbout $40,000 This road
which is to be extended on to Lord
burg, constitutes one of the fincsl
highways in the entire state, if not in
the whole Southwest and will endure
for years to come.
When the Lordsburg public school
girls, in the last half of the game Sat
urday against tho Silver City public
school girls' team, Managed to make
two field throws and two freo throws,
the n-nrclicd away with tho cham
pionship of tho gills teams in south
ern New Mexico and Arizonn. Pre
viously they had beaten Doming nnd
Clifton, Arie.
A good crowd witnessed tho con-
tost dospite tho hwivy wind storm.
During tho first half of the game
Silver City mado two points and until
tho closing minutes of the battle
Lordsburg looked doomed. Suddenly
tho girls took on new courage and
kept the ball on their side of the
field, Annie McMeans and Rosie
Robson each miking a. field basket
and Miss Robson two standing throws.
The strong wind prevented many
other points being made on both
sides as at a number of limes the ball
circled the rim of the basket, did the
hesitation and fell back to earth.
Tho game Saturday was well
played on nil sides. The guarding
was excellent and some fine throws
were made, interest being kept alert
at every stage of the battle.
The Lordsburg playera were: Dor
othy and Ruth Cha3c, Annie Mc
Means, Rosie Robson, Loir. Locklear
and Kathryn Bailey. Miss Matilda
Beam coached.
