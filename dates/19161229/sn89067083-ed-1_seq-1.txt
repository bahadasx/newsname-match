Harris 4 Harris, from the uDDer
Nueces river oountry, in Texas,
arrived at Winona, week before
last, with a train load of shesD.
In the lot were 2,000 ewes and a
good number of thoroughbred
bucks. These gentlemen have
established a large sheep ranch
in the northern part of Oregon
county. This ranch Is looated
near, the Peter Falrbairrt sheep
ranch, whioh is just pyer the Rip
ley county Una, and which is now
ranging 2200 head, and more are
expeoted early in the year. From
the present outlook the raising of
sheep will eAon be one of the most
profitable industries of the Ozark
oountry. Stookmen and dairy
men from the north weetern states
are learning that this Ozark ooun
try offers a milder , climate, just
as good pasturage and a much
shorter feeding season than they
have in the colder . climate, even
if it is not so dry. In conse
quence many are ooming into the
Current river Ozark oountry with
oattle, sheep and dairy cows, and
hogs naturally follow. Something
over a year ago a man iroved in
to Shannon sounty, near Winona
and brought with him 1,600 ewes.
The first year he clipped 6,000
pounds of wool, shearing some of
the flock lwlce,-od rtod 1,000
lambs. . He sold hia wool oIid for
30 cents a pound, realizing $1,600
and his lambs went on the mar
ket clean and in good oondition,
and brought him something over
$11.00 apiece, aggregating- $11,
000 for the thousand bead sold.
He fed bis flock one oar-load of
prairie hay and an average per
bead of halt a bushel of grain;
while there was sleet and , snow
on the ground, the feed costing
him about $1,800. He says be
cleared $10,000 on his one thous-
head of ewes, and bis figures
show it. . That looks like a profit
able business. 8inoe his experi
ence several . other sheep men
have oome and more are coming.
The same thing oan be said by
those who have tried cattle breed
ing,' and hog raising, and the
stookmen in this Current river
Ozark country are' all making
money. , And now the dairying
men are getting ready to push to
the front. Well, let 'em come

Frederick Coleman Tells What
Went Wrong In That
' Battle;
m w fom success
Writer Discourses In an Interesting
. Manner Concerning a Famous
, , Battle and Its Outcome
SUff Is at Fault,
London. In "With Cavalry In 1915"
Mr. Frederick. Coleman throws new
light on a famous fight. Over eud over
again has been heard the question,
"What went wrong at Neuve CUa
pellel" Some explanation of the diffi
culties encountered on that early effort
at a "push" is given by Mr. Coleman,
though he Is careful to say "Let the
writer of the future dig the story out
of the tangled orders of the day."
Nevertheless, he was on the spot:
he served Gen. do Lisle as volun
teer chauffeur, and waa In closo touch
with the principal actors In the
drama, and to some extent he raises
the veil behind which quite properly
many will agree the details of that
engagement are at present hidden.
"General Ilalg bad been quite rea
sonably correct In his estimate of the
enemy's strength," Mr. Coleman says.
"Our chance to break through the Ger
man line was the finest opportunity of
the whole war. That with such odds In
our favor, with a preponderance of
guns, and shells as well, we would have
so signally failed and lost 18,000 men
Into the bargain required some expla
nation. "The tragedy of Neuve Chapelle was
a failure to take advantage of an Ini
tial success."
brlKndos engaged and then" TOnuutlwrrt
Who initial success won, the wnoie
line waited, eyes on the right, for the
signal to go on. Before nine o'clock
In the morning all was ready, and the
road cleared.
;' "All day the watchers wotted In
.vain..
r "It was after four o'clock In the aft
ernoon before the word came. It waa
then too late, . The great opportunity
had been lost, and lost forever,
; Traelng the Fault
! "The Germans had rallied, filled
farms with machine guns, and mowed
down the gallant Twenty-third and
Twenty-fifth brigades, who Had so
dearly won such splendidly advanced
positions. '
, "The Twenty-fourth brigade had
coma on part way, then concentrated
'and was sadly cut up. That the line
on the right bad 'dug In' Instead of
'moving forward had resulted In a de
feat When a great victory was within
grasp. And who waa to blame I
i "A brlgnde commander aud the gen
eral in command of the artillery on a
certain division were promptly stellen
boeched.' A divlalonal commander was
reported ami sent home, aud his case
reopened when he declared the fault
was not Ws, as could be proved by cer
tain hitherto uuproduced papers from
corps headquarters. A further Inquiry
resulted in his being reinstated. Ills
corps commander went to England
At home,' Bald many. Shortly after
.ward back be came, to the discomfiture
of the prophets, and took up bis old
command." , : . . '
Mr. Coleman's final comment is: "No
battle of such mngaitude could be won
without fine staff work, and the work
of more than oue staff on that March
10 left much to be desired,"
' . There are other disclosures of fail
ure on the part of the British la the
early days of the campaign fuilures
j due far more to Inexperience than to
I Incompetence and failures which are
I not likely to be repented. Through Mr.
! Coleman one ia . able to appreciate
all the myriad difficulties with which
.brigade, divisional and corps command
ers had to contend throughout the cam-
'paign of 1810, ,
Transportation al Fault -There
Is, for example, the tragedy
behind the scene' of the great Cana
dian fight before Tpres and the strug
gle for Bill 60 In April, 1915: - .
; "A run to Cosset at daybreak was a
maddening experience, the road from
Steenvoorde to - Poperingho . being
packed and jammed with alt manner
of horse and motor transport A big
five-ton lorry belonging to the Cana
dians had broken down aa It was be
ing turned in the narrow roadway.
Result, an immovable barrier across
the pave. ; .
' ; "Truly an ounce of prevention In the
way of road organization and route
Selection by some competent authority
-would have been worth many pounds
of condemnation poured forth with vol
ubility by nil road users In those duya
.of tiresome trade tansies." .....
There were other little things that
wanted organteution-iund have since
been seen to. In the Hooge buttle an
offlcer'a dinry records a niosaage sent
to brigade headquii , asWng for
"two dozen extra d Viators per regi
