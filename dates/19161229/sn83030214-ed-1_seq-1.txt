WORLDWIDE PEACE DRIVE
ISLAUNOBBYGHMANY
Propaganda Kept Up In Every
Neutral Nation to Hold Door
Open to Negotiations.
HINTS READINESS TO TELL
TERMS TO PRESIDENT WILSON
Gerard's Report on Zimmermann interview
Awaited ? Talk of Break on U-Boat
Pledge Violations Unfounded
[From Thr- Tribune Bureau J
Washington, Dec. 28.?The world soon will understand that
the Germans are making a drive for peace, and that, no matter
what the immediate outcome of the Allies' reply, they intend
to continue it until the end?for years if need be. Above all
other things, the Germans do not want to close the door to peace
talk, and are hinting that they will tell their terms to President
Wilson if necessary to keep the negotiations from stopping.
The peace drive is being and will continu'* to be managed
with all the efficiency characteristic of the German militan
policy. President Wilson has been used. He will be used again.
All possible pressure that can be exerted through neutral gov?
ernments will be brought to bear to veer public opinion around
in favor of the German cause.
In short, peace .sentiment is to be expedited all over the
world wherever the Germans have a ghost of a show.
The German government is not at all hopeful that immedi?
ate peace will come from the negotiations which have been
started by it. reinforced by the President of the United .States,
but it believes, as all the world believes, that eventually peace
is coming. It cannot come too quickly to suit the German cause.
Why. then, not work for it?
All this was stated with most engaging frankness this
afternoon by one high in the confidence of the Teutonic powers.
