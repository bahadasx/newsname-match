STATE BUDGET HIGHER
FOR NEXT BIENNIUM
REQUESTS OF COLLEGES BOOST
TOTAL ABOVE 922,000,000
FOR 1917-10.
Legislative appropriations aggre
gating more than $22,000,00, over
$2 ,000,000 more than for the current
biennium, are recommended by the
state board of finance in its budget
of state expense, showing in detail
the financial needs of the various
state offices, departments and insti
tutions for the coming biennium.
The major part of the increase is
In the amounts asked by the educa
tional institutions upon which the
board makes no recommendations.
The budget will be submitted to the
legislature as a basis for the biennial
appropriations.
In the recapitulation It is shown
that the general fund will require
$/,237,994 during the two years, be
ginning April 1, 1917, the special or
trust funds will need $8,775,831,
-while the higher educational institu
tions have asked for $4,379,885.
Adding to this the mill levy for the
public highway fund, amounting to
$1,815,509, the total reaches $22,-
209,170. The highway appropria
tion Incidentally, is $362,557 less
than for the present biennium.
As against this figure the 1915 ap
propriations show a total of a little
more than $20,141,291. The 1915
appropriation for the general fund
totaled $6,432,270, while that for the
special funds totaled $8,691,655 and
tbat for the higher Institutions of
learning $2828,399. The public high
way fund appropriation was $2,188,-
OC6.
Prom this it will be seen that,
aside from 'an increase of $806,-
974.19 in the general fund, the re
mainder of the $2,000,000 asked
above the 1915 appropriations Is due
to the additional amounts sought by
the higher Institutions of learning.
The board of finance makes no rec
ommendations on these items, "pass
ing the buck" to the legislature.
The boards report points out that
the concluding year of Governor Lis
ter's first term finds a balance of sl.-
•00,000 in the general fund instead
of the overdraft of $600,000 that con
fronted him when he took office. Out
of the balance now available the
board urges the legislature to take
up the normal school bonds, amount
ing to $206,024, and also the We
natchee bridge bonds, which call for
962,000.
With the retirement of these two
Issues the state will be free of any
bonded indebtedness.
Although the board cut $612,000
from requisitions for new buildings
by state Institutions largely, the grand
total allowed for the general fund
•hows an increase of $805,674.19
over the total of $6,432,270.15 ap
propriated by the 1915 legislature for
the state expenditure from the gen
eral fund Most of the state depart
ment heads asked for increases, and
few showed decreases. In a measure
most of the department Increases
wre granted, which means increased
salaries for various chief assistants
if the legislature is favorably in
clined to the recommendations made.
The board of control cuts its ex
pense $45,000, a decrease of $35,000
1b made in the land commissioner's
requisitions and the tax commission
Is $3,000 below the 1915 allowance.
The governor's office requirements
show a cut of SSOO, and the whole
biennial appropriation of $9,000 for
executive mansion maintenance is
eliminated by the governor's refusal
to occupy the mansion after April 1.
He considers the amount entirely
■ufflcient for the purpose, but de
clines to submit any longer to the red
tape program that runs from the
state auditor to the attorney gener
al's office over items of mansion ex
pense.
As a result of the governor'- de
termination to close the executive
mansion at the end of the present
biennium the budget contains no rec
ommendation in regard to it. but
Treasurer Edward Meath. the other
member of the board, will go before
the legislature and urge that an ap
propriation be made. He will also
ask that the law be changed so as to
give the governor full charge over
the mansion maintenance fund, the
handling of which is now vested in
the governor, auditor and treasurer

Alleged failure of the city author
ities of Tumwater to enforce quar
antine against a family in which
there was a child sick from scarlet
fever, resulting in spread of the
disease so that a child in another

HEW TO THE LINE; LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY."
OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1916.
TO Slit THE
CONDITIONS OF Will
BUSINESS MEN WILL ASSEMBLE
NEXT MONTH TO CONSIDER
COMING PROBLEMS.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 29.
Following an urgent call to partici
pate in a discussion of pressing na
tional questions now facing Ameri
can business, representatives of com
mercial organizations all over the
country have signified their intention
of being present in larger numbers
than probably ever before, at the
fifth annual meeting of the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States to
be held here January 31, February
1 and 2.
The war having opened a new era
in world commerce, business men are
facing conditions without precedent
which will have to be met at its close.
It is argued this state of affairs will,
of course, affect the nation's foreign
trade and it will also have far-reach
ing influence upon domestic business.
Accordingly, the railroad situa
tion, national defense, and many
other questions of paramount im
portance are included in the sub
jects to be discussed at the meeting.
It is because these issues are so urg
ent and of such vital importance to
the future development of the United
States that the unusually large rep
resent|tion promises to be in at
tendance. Business men to the
number of from 1,000 to 1,500, se
lected as delegates and alternates by
the commercial bodies affiliated with
the National Chamber, will be pres
ent.
In dealing with the preparation
for conditions after the war, promi
nent speakers will discuss separate
phases, such as business, finanee,
transportation, and education for
foreign trade. Of particular inter
est will be that part of the discus
sion devoted to the railroad situa
tion.
HIGHER WAGES FOR
6,000,000 WORKERS
WIDESPREAD PROSPERITY GIVES
•800,000,000 EXTRA TO MANY
EMPLOYES.
Not less than 5,760,000 salaried
employes and wage workers have oc-
casion to rejoice during the holidays
over the widespread prosperity pre
vailing in the United States.
This estimate of the number of
persons affected by the Increases in
salaries and wages, bonuses, profit
sharing plans and insurance benefits
ts made by Secretary of Labor Wil
son, based upon reports received by
his department.
While no estimate of the aggre
gate amount of money distributed
under these various plans for helping
employes to celebrate the present
holidays and to enable them to
meet the high cost of living is made
by the government, it is generally es
timated that it will exceed 1300,000,-
000.
The employes who have benefited
from these concessions made by indi
viduals, firms and corporations in
clude almost every variety of labor—
clerical forces, skilled workmen, mill
workers, miners, railway employes,
cotton, silk, worsted and factory
hands and common laborers.
The reports to the department of
labor indicate that the Increase in
wages average about 10 per cent,
while the bonuses to salary employes
range from 5 to 50 per cent.
The industrial enterprises have
contributed the larger part of the
aggregate increases in the way of
wages and salaries, and It Is signifi-
cant of the universal prosperity
which the country is now enjoying
that every variety of undertaking is
represented in the distribution of
benefits.

i IN NEXT GON6RESS
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS
j OF BOTH HOUSES WILL BE
BADLY SPLIT.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 29.
Political seers foresee nothing but
mutiny in both houses of the Sixty
fifth congress, which convenes next
December, unless called in extra ses
sion by the president next March.
With house Republicans in revolt
against James R. Mann's leadership,
Progressive Republicans fighting the
Old Guard in the senate, and the sen
| ate Democrats widely split over a
successor to Leader John W. Kern,
nothing but inner party strife is In
prospect for the next congress.
The election over, both Republic
ans and Democrats have deliberately
cast aside party harmony and appor
' tioned the next two years to the pay-
I ment of old scores within their re
| spective parties. Here Is the way the
three separate revolts line up:
Representative Gardner of Massa
chusetts, Roosevelt supporter in the
last pre-convention primaries, is after
the scalp of Republican Leader
Mann, whom he accuses of being
"pro-German." Progressive Repub
lican congressmen, including Repre
sentative-elect Medlll McCormick of
llNnois, are expected to join the
Gardner faction.
Progressive Republican senators
have burled the peace pipe and dug
np the hatchet and renewed their old
fend with the Old Ouard. In the
jnext congress they will have Hiram
JohneoQ, senator-elect from Califor
nia, as an ally, and war exceeding in
fury the 1912 days is anticipated.
The South and West, which re
elected the president, have already
broken with each other in the senate
and are engaged in a bitter row over
the election of a successor to Leader
Kern, whose term expires March 4.
The Southern Democrats want Sena
tor Martin of Virginia and the West
Is supporting Senator Walsh of Mon
tana, who managed the Democratic
campaign in the West.
"0" AND COLLEGE
FIGHT DUE AGAIN
RIVALRY OVER APPROPRIATIONS
TO RE RENEWED AT COMING
LEGISLATURE.
The old rivalry over appropriations
between the University of Washing
ton and the State College rft Pullman
promises to be renewed at the coming
session of the legislature with in
creased bitterness. One indication of
It is seen in the fact that the state
board of finance, in preparing the
budget for the next biennium, made
no recommendations as to appropria
tions for these institutions but sim
ply transmitted the proposals sub
mitted by each.
The educational survey, provided
for by the 1915 legislature, recom
mended an increase in the tax levy
for higher educational institutions
from 1.05 mills to 1.90 mills and
changes in the curriculum of the uni
versity and the college that would
eliminate the duplication of wdrk in
♦hose two institutions.
President Holland of the State Col
lege has declared his opposition to
the survey's findings so far as the
changes In curriculum are concerned,
while the recommendation of an In
creased levy has not oroved popular
with the taxpayers, hoped that
some means could be dbvised for lim
iting the rapidly growing cost of
higher education In the state.
The survey also recommended the
establishment of an additional nor
mal srhool to be located in Southwest
Washington, and this promises an-
other matter for controversy.

Ed to feel thnt instead of solving the
problems that already exist. the sur

RESULTS SHOW EOOD
WIN EXPERTS DO
EXTENSION WORK DEMONSTRAT
ING ITS VALUE IN DEVELOP
ING FARMING BUSINESS.
As a result of the realization that
Improved methods may be brought to
the attention of the farmer more ef
fectively by personal contact and dem
onstration than in any other way, the
county agricultural agent work was
begun in the Northern and Western
states in 1911 by the United States
department of agriculture, the state
agricultural colleges, and county
agencies, in cooperation.
During this year only five county
agents were operating in the North
ern and Western states, but by July
1, 1916, the number had increased to
419, the work having been taken up
in every one of the Northern and
Western states, says the Weekly News
Letter of the department. While the
general nature of the activities of the
agents is the same throughout the
territory, the provisions under which
the states assist in the work vary con
siderably.
In some states the cooperation of
organized groups of farmers in the
counties is a prerequisite to contribu
tion of state funds, and in many in
stances these farmers contribute
directly a substantial part of the nec
essary expense money. Even where
the existence of such organizations is
not required many have sprung up
and are playing important parts in
the success of the county agent work.
Money for carrying on the county
agent activities is contributed by the
federal government through the
United States department of agricul
ture and the agricultural extension
act fund; by the states, usually
through the agricultural colleges; by
county supervisors; by local farmers;
and by public-spirited individuals and
organizations in both county and city.
The average annual budget for
the work of each county agent is
about $3,000.
The County Agents' Plan of Work.
The work of the county agents va
ries with the needs of their communi
ties, but in general is addressed to the
improvement of agricultural methods,
practices, and conditions wherever
' possible through demonstrations,
talks, and publications, and through
calling attention to good methods
already practiced by the best farm
ers of the community. The needs of
the county usually are discussed by
the agents with state extension work
leaders, county officials, and leading
farmers, and a project program
adopted.
Farmers are then found who are
willing to cooperate in the demon
stration of certain improved meth
ods and, when results of the demon
strations are apparent, field meet
ings are held in order that the farni
! ers may see the results and deter
mine their value. The agent also
assists the farmers to organize co-
I operative associations, conducts short
'courses ir? agriculture, holds meet
ings, often Illustrated by lantern
slides of local agricultural subjects,
writes timely agricultural articles
which are published In the local
county press, and carries on other

BREEDERS' CLUB
MAKING PROGRESS
INTERESTED FARMERS TO MEET
AGAIN JANUARY 0 TO PER
FECT DETAILS.
Considerable progress toward the
formation of a Thurston County
Breeders' Association to be composed
of local farmers interested in improv
ing their dairy rattle, was made at
the meeting of the Chamber of Com
merce last Saturday afternoon, at
tended by some 20 farmers. Further
features of the organization will be
discussed at a meeting Saturday af
ternoon, January 8, when it iB hoped
that either the new county agent or
Supervisor R. B. Coglon can attend.
Temporary officers were elected at
the meeting last Saturday, L. R.
Campbell, president of the Dairy
men's Association and Cow-Testing
Association and a leader in organ
izing the Breeders' Association, being
chosen president, and Walter R. Tay
lor of South Union secretary-treas
urer. Farmers representing differ
ent districts in the county were dele
gated as committees to discuss the
formation of the proposed association
with the farmers of their respective
communities, the idea of the organi
sation being to have a representative
of each community on the board of
directors.
Six Districts in County.
The tentative plan of organization
contemplates dividing the county into
•ix districts and the purchase of six
high grade bulls from stock produc
ing from 500 to 600 pounds of. but
terfat per year Arrangements have
been made with the Tacoma Rotary
club to advance the money with
which to buy these animals if It can
not be obtained locally, and a repre
sentative of that organisation Is to
attend the meeting January 6.
The average production of the cows
composing the Cow-Testing associa
tion is at the rate of 150 to 21)0
pounds of butterfat per year, though
there are individual cows producing
as high as 500 pounds. The object
of the Breeders' association Is to
breed the dairy herds of the county
up to a higher average butterfat pro
duction, the bulls being moved f»m
one district to another every two
yean to prevent ln-bredlng.
Promoters of the association i>&-
lleve that It can be established with
practically no Initial expense to thy
farmers joining, the money with
which the bulls are to be purchased
being paid off by the service fee#.
They point out that the Cow-Testing
association is showing its members
their unprofitable cows, 'and thf
Breeders' association will enable
them to improve their herds.
Very Important, Taylor Thinks.
"I think this association the most
important thing our farmers can
carry out," says Walter R. Taylor\
the secretary-treasurer. "It a farmer
lyiys high-grade cows now, paying
S2OO for them, and imports them into
the county, the heifers will not be up
to standard because there are no
high-grade bulls in the county and h6
has a scrub herd on his hands again
in a few yeafs.
t "But one high-grade bull, serving
a district, will soon breed up the
present herds and at very little ex
pense to the farmers. Our dairy
herds here certainly need improving,
and the Breeders' association offers
I the cheapest and best way of doing
! it."
Farmers generally are reported to
. be much Interested In the formation
of a Breeders' association here and it
!is hoped that a large number will
attend the meeting January 6.
