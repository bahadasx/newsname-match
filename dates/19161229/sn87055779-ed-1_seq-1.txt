Attitude of Arredondo
Who Decides to Stay

WASHINGTON, Lec. 29. Car
ranza's answer to the American de
mand that the Atlantic City protocol
be ratified as it was agreed upon
will be laid before the American
section of the joint cimmission here
Tuesday next. Sec'y of the Interior
ltne. chairman of the American
sfi-tiiin. learned today that Judge
George Cray, and John H. Mott, thej
other American commissioners, could
outer with him at that time.
Fnles.s there is some new mme
by Venustiano Carranza. the Amer
ica ft section will reiterate the state
jnei.t made in Philadelphia last
v,rk that it cannot consent to any
alteration of the protocol.
Th first evidence was seen today
in unofficial communications to in
dicate that throughout his insist
ence upon withdrawal of American
troops as a part of the protocol,
'arran.a has been "blurting" to
.-on ie extent.

The only possibility of a change
in attitude, well informed officials
said today, is that Pres't Wilson will
be winning to make concessions to
the de facto Government of Mexico.
He has not yet acted on the protocol,
but the understanding here has been
th it ho would back up Sec'y of the
Interior Line, who is chairman of
the American section of the com
mission, in .any move he thought
jse.
There is- nothing new in these ob
jetlion. and when practically the
Mine communication was laid before
tiie Americans some time ago they
l ejected the suceste,! changes, in
forming tho constitutionalist first
hief that the original protocol must
stand or fall without change.

The belief has been prevalent for

RAIL STRIKE
Officials at Washington Admit
Danger is Real One In
censed Over Action of
Railroad Systems.
VARIOUS LOCALS ARE
INSISTING ON ACTION
One Great Check is Knowledge
That if Strike is Called
Congress Will Jam
Through Legislation.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 20. That
the dancer of a Ftrike of the "big
four" brotherhood members Is a
real one was quietly admitted In of
ficial (juarters here today. The
union men are bitterly Incensed
over the attitude taken by the va
rious railroad systems in declining
to accept the provisions of the
Adamson law until its legality has
been passed upon by the supreme
court of the Fnited States.
Word has reached the white house
and the federal conciliation hoard
that various locals of the brother
hoods now are demanding that the
strike order, made effective by an
overwhelming vote and then held
up by the brotherhood chiefs, fol
lowing the passage of the Adamson
act. be revived at once. This the
brotherhood heads don't want to do.
but word has reached I'res't Wil
son and his advisers that the task
of keeping the union men in line
is a very difficult one. They are
demanding that they be permitted
to strike ar.d also that the various
other demands, including time and
a half for overtime and the like, he
revived.
iKM-i-don in February.
It is asserted in circles close to
the attorney general that a decision
in the Adamson act hardly can bo
looked for before the mi Idle of Feb
ruary. And should, the questions at
issue be such as to result in a wide
division in the supreme court, it is
entirely possible that the decision
may be held up for weeks. This
naturally "will add to the disaffection
among the railroad men.
The one great check to a strike
order under existing circumstances
is the knowledge of the labor lead
ers that if on is issued congress
will jam through the compulsory
arbitration act in a hurry. This is
the one thing that the labor leaders
do not want. But there now is a
feeling among many members of
congress that the enactment of the
Adamson act alone is a mistake and
it is entirely possible that this feel
ing will be taken advantage of by
the president to get the remainder
of the legislative program approved.
Start Hearing Monday.
The interstate commerce commit
tee will commence its hearings next
Monday on the proposed bills includ
ing that which provides for compul
sory arbitration. Organized labor is
to be strongly represented in oppo
sition to the latter measure.

American federation of labor, will

WASHINGTON, Dec. 29. The
federal reserve board will give' its
strong backing to a fight on the
I-art of the American bankers to
make dollar exchange the standard
in the far east.
It was learned today that a plan
is under consideration for the exten
sion of American banking facilities
in the orient, designed to undermine
the campaign that Japanese banks
are making for financial supremacy
in the eastern market. The federal
reserve bank of San Francl5co short
ly will name banks in Manila, Hong
Kong, Yokohama and Malbourne,
Australia, as foreign correspondents.
This move is designed to put a stop
to the drawing of far eastern bills
of exchange of London and switch
the business to the Fnited States.
It is hoped the plan can be per
fected before the end of the war so
that Americans can get a firm hold
on oriental trade before the Euro
pean banks and business houses re
sumed their trade relations in the
far cast.
