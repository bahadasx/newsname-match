the conferences which - have been in
progress for several days, the Ententereply
to the German note is now completed.
It could go forward Friday or
Saturday except for the necessary formality
of transmitting it to all the
Allies before final delivery. This
means that the delivery will be made
early in or in the middle of next week,
perhaps on Wednesday.
The delivery will be made at Paris,
after which the communication will be
forwarded to Germany through American
channels. The reply is a very
long document, much more lengthy
than the German note.
Unusual optimism is shown here as
a result of the final form which the
reply has taken which is believed to
be such that it will meet with satisfaction
at Washington.
The reply to the American note will
follow in a few days after the delivery
f of the reply to Germany.

EYIYES HOMERIC ART j
In the old Homeric days the lyre
and human voice portrayed the happenings
of the day and age. Today
the printed sheet does this, but cold
type cannot supply the human touch
needed to give a line strength, force
and sympathy. The revival of this
mn?t human nf ?TI tha dramatic arts
is being sponsored by a gifted exponent,
Miss Janet Mannheimer.
Eleanor Gates, the author, calls her {
"first aid to playwrights" because
she "interprets a drama, giving each
scene its proper value and reading
each line so well that both the beauty
and underlying thought is clearly
brought out."

?R FOR OIL

Purchasing Agencies in the
City of Pittsburg.
car aaaociATao paiaa)
PITTSBURG, Dec. 29?The highest
price ever quoted- for Pennsylvania
crude oil was announced by the
principal purchasing agencies Friday
when through an advance of ten
cents a barrels the quotation reached
$2.85. Other grades were advanced
as follows: Mercer black, $2.30;
Corning, $2.25; Cabell, $2.22; Somerset,
$2.05. There was no change
in Ragland, which continued at
ninety-five cents.
The advance was brought about by
the continued demand of refiners who
declare that there is an abundance
of oil above ground but producers
are holding it for still higher prices,
some of them being quoted as de
daring that not until the goal of
oil is reached will they release their
stocks.

NEW PROCESS
FOR IKING
OF SUGAR NOW
From "Final Molasses" is Announced
by the Hawaiian
Sugar Planters.
A*?r>e?*T*0 MlfH
HONOLULU. T. H.. Dec. 29?A
new process for the manufacture of
sugar from "final molasses" which
was announced at the annual meeting
of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters'
Association this month may. it is estimated.
result in a saving of not less
than $2,600,000 a yoar to the sugar
me/i of the Hawaiian islands, and effect
even greater saving in Cuba and
other cane-growing countries.
The process was announced by J.
N. S. Williams, of the Island of Maul,
who is tho Inventor. He has not
patented his process and its use is,
therefore, open to all sugar-growers.
The planters' association went on
record as recognizing Mr. Williams's
discovery as the biggest achievement
of the year in the sugar industry.
The process takes from the so-called
"final mo'asses" approximately
one-half of the eight per cent of
sugar that has hitherto been considered
a total loss. No process had
been known by which this sugar
could be crystalized and recovered.
In Mr. Williams's process the
"first" molasses is boiled as usual,
but instead of ceasing to boll it at
the usual stage, the boiling is continued
up to the point of practical
exclusion of all water. The resulting
product, whi'e still hot, is run into
containers, where it is allowed to
cool and solidify for about a week,
becoming as bard as rock. This material.
which contains .the crystalized
sugar, is broken, passed through
a crushing process, mixed with water
until it. becomes once more a rodlasses-like
texture, and finally run
through a specially constructed centrifugal.
This makes about 2,000
revolutions per minute, about double
the usual number, and It successful
ly extracts the sugar that formerly
was lost.
