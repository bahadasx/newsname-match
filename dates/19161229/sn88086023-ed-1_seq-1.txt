FOUND NOT GUILTY
OF SLAYING DEER
A jury in the justice court last
evening found Luke Lane of Milton
not guilty of violating the game laws
by killing a pet deer belonging to
Fred Sams. Though he admittedly shot
the animal, the Jury probably took
into consideration that C. A, Winn,
special deputy warden, had practical
ly advised him to that end.
Mr. Lane, who was represented by
S. D. Peterson, declared that the an
imal was a nuisance and was danger
ous. There was no good evidence to
the effect that the fleer was danger
ous but it was shown that it wander,
ed about more or less on other peo
ple's property. Winn testified that
he had told Lone that he would kill
the deer if It bothered him as much
asthe latter claimed to be bothered
by it. Lone testified that he shot the
animal with a shotgun at a distance
of 60 yards.
