CAPITAL HOPEFUL DESPITE
ENTENTE PEACE STATEMENT
Central Powers Insisting in Confer
t ence While Allies Refuse Until
Germany's Terms are Made
Known.
Washington, Dec. 27. In spite of
the wide gulf between the insistence
of the central powers for an immedi
ate peace conference and the forecast
of a unanimous refusal by the entente
allies to enter such a conference with
out knowing Germany's terms in ad
vance, the American government be
lieves that the negotiations in prog
ress are resulting in good.
It was said with authority tonight
that until the door to peace actually
is closed by one side or the other,
President Wilson will continue to hope
that any discussion of the subject will
tend to hasten the end of the war.

Several from this vicinity attended
the L. T. L. meeting at Gunter, Sun
day afternoon. There was a good at
tendance and much interest manifested
and after the children's exercises a
union Sunday school was organized
and from the interest manifested we
anticipate a successful school.
Win, Gray, wife and son of Sti-cSS"

He has given up his position as sec

Henry Haney and family is visit
ing relatives near this place.
Jas. Gray, wife and son, spent
Christmas with home folks in this vi
cinity. The Christmas tree for the pupils
of the school at this place and that of
Gunter school was a success and very
much appreciated by the children..
Christmas passed off very quietly
with no trouble or disturbance of any
kind.
When the big snow fell about -two
weeks ago Thos. Ferguson made a V
shaped drag with which he removed
the snow from the road from his farm
to this place and did the same again
lit week and Frank Williams made
one and dragged the snow from the
road from Gunter to Arnhart school
house and wo are informed that M.
F. and Homer Terry continued the
work from there to Purdy. That is
certainly commendable as it puts the
road in better condition while the
snow is on the ground and prevents
it being so soft and slushy when the
snow melts. Let others take up the
good work and keep the roads in as
good condition as possible when snow
falls. The drag is made of oak 2
inches thick and should be about 8
feet wide at the back or open end so
as to push the snow clear off the road.

! FRESH AIR JS BEST REMEDY
FOR PREVENTION OF GRIPPE
Winter Diseases Are Contagious and
Can Be Contracted in Crowds or
Stuffy Rooms.
(By Dr. M. P. Ravenel.)
The season for pneumonia, bron
chitis, cold and grippe is upon us.
These diseases are all spread by
germs. The most common way in
which they are spread is by close con
tact from persons to person. The lia
bility to contract these is greatly les
sened by one accustoming one's self to
an abundance of fresh air. Not only
is the body kept in better condition
and better able to resist infection,
but there is also less chance of the
infection spreading.
' The increase in outdoor life has
been notable for some years past.
It has been brought about by the dem
onstration of great value of fresh
air in the treatment of tuberculosis
, and haeery'' argument to recom-
'lnendMiliitjtfurage.
. ' FMMiou?es are built at the present
time' without sleeping porches. Any
one who has once used a sleeping
porch finds it difficult to be contented
in doors. There is a sense of well
being after a night spent in the open
air.
It is interesting to note that with
the approach of winter, when we go
into houses and keep our windows
closed, that there is an immediate in-.
crease in tne diseases mentioned.
This is strikingly illustrated by an ob
servance the sickness in great cities.
For example, in New York these dis
eases reach their maximum in March

.
with over 1500 deaths. With the ad-.
vance of spring, they decrease rapid-
ly falling to less than 500 in the .
month of September. With the ojen;
ofli4jrt!rTmne"Trong of win
December the number of deaths has '
reached slightly over 1200. There are j
other factors, of course, involved. It
is a known fact, however, that those :
who live in the open and constantly
breathe an abundance of fresh air are ;
peculiarly free from these winter dis
eases. Pneumonia an(f colds are practically
unknown among Arctic explorers and
in the regions of the far north.
As was pointed out by Benjamin j,
Franklin, 160 years ago, and 100 years j
