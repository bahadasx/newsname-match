Saturday will be a day of caucuses,
The big three-ring show will be the
Non-partisan league conference.
There will :be at least one interest­
ing side-show, staged by Republican
standpat and holdover members of
the senate. It is possible that one
or two other attractions will toe. of­
fered.
The league's big talk-talk tomorrow
will be on the constitutional conven­
tion, how, when, where and why to
holil it. That there will be a con­
stitutional convention there is no
question. Prominent statesmen free­
ly admit its necessity, even though it
is apparent that the news leaked out
a trifle earlier than was anticipated.
A complete legislative program will
be mapped out tomorrow by the
league. Final sanction will be given
the election of Howard R. Wood of
Deering to the speakership, and his
committee appointments and those of
Lieutenant-Governor A. T. Kraabel
will toe given the once over. Wood
is understood to have his chairmen
picked, subject to approval at the
caucus tomorrow. Committee news
no doubt will toe announced tomorrow
evening.
Some Insurgency.*
Some insurgency in the senate
seems certain. While the league
claims a small majority in this body,
there is a seridtas question as to the
disposition of even certain league
members to stay put. Of the ftV sen­
ators clectedlast November, 18 are
committed to the league and seven
are independent of any allegiance.
Of the 24 holdovers, all but two are
'Republicans, ioitikinig the independent
'Republican Membership of the sen­
ate, including'the seven elected this
year, 29, giving1 the free-lances a ma­
jority of five if all herd together.
The league, however, claims at least
seven of the holdovers, in which event
the league would have a majority of
three in the senate.
It is understood that a Republican
caucus will be held tomorrow, when
the question to be determined will be
whether the control of the senate is
to pass from Republican hands, where
it has reposed since the beginning of
time. One interesting result of this
caucus should be to reveal the actual
line-up in the senate, and to show
just where the league's strength will
lie with the holdovers, many of whom
have been careful not to show their
hands since the general election.
May Interfere.
This uncertainty as to the senate
may interefei*#! to some extent with
the league's plans for a constitutional
convention. If the senate can be or­
ganized safely,, there is no question
that a constitutional convention, com­
posed of legislators, would be the log­
ical thing for the league. With 24
holdover senators who do not dwe
their election to the league, and with
seven others who were elected in
spite of the league, there is, however,
a possibility of complications.
Governor On the Job.
Governor Frazier, the "man of si­
lence," is on the job today, dropping
a priceless word here and there, but
in no conversation yet on record vol­
unteering more than a dozen sylla­
bles. The governor arrived with his
family late last night, on No. 1, and
has quarters temporarily at the Mc
Kenzie, pending the provisioning of
the executive mansion.
Kraabel is Here.
A. T. Kraabel of Clifford arrived
last night to take up for. the second
time the 'burdens of lieutenant-gover­
nor. Kraabel is one of the real vet­
erans of the present assembly, this
being his fifth session. The lieuten
ant-governor has nothing as yet to say
on the subject of appointments. He
has even less to say as to possible
legislation. Even the impending con­
stitutional convention was news to
him, his first inkling of the plan com­
ing from a newspaper report which
he read enroute to Bismarck.
Hotels Filling Up.
All of the hotels are fast filling up.
Lieutenant-Governor Kraabel has es­
tablished headquarters at the Grand
Pacific, where Judges Robinson and
Grace of the supreme court and a
number of legislators are located.
President C. A. Townley and other
league leaders are established at the
Mckenzie, pending the opening of the
iNorthwest. 'Many of the prominent
members of the general assembly are
quartered at the VanrHorn, and oth­
ers have taken rooms for the session
at Ihe Annex. S. A. Olsness. commis­
sioner of insurance, is at the Grand

sioner of agriculture and labor, is at

"The carrying out of the wishes of

Washington, Dec. 29 —The contror

Wood's resolution for investigating as
to whether any member of President
Wilson's official family profited in the
stock market because of the "inside in­
formation" of the president's peace

when Chairman Henry of the house

would be another.
"Put up or shut up," said Chairman
Henry's telegram. "Cease stock slan­

Mr. Henry announced that he would

"This short session should find a

OECBEE ISSUED
Mexico City, Dec. 29.—A decree has
been issued giving foreigners holding
title to real estate, mining and oil
properties, and timber lands, until Ap­
ril 15 to resign their treaty rights in­
sofar as the properties in question are
concerned. Formal renunciation of
such rights must be made in accord­
ance with the decree, issued more
than four months ago, which provides
that such foreigners must in effect be­
come Mexican citizens insofar as their
property was concerned. There was
some uncertainty as to whether the
decree is retroactive and affects .pres­
ent enterprises or only future rights.

(Associated Press.)
Madrid, Dec. 29.—The note address­

clares that the Spanish government
has always maintained that it was il­
legal to destroy prizes as is the con­
stant practice of submarines, and that
the Cabinet also demanded the observ­
ation of the Declaration of London,
notably Article 50, which it is main­
tained submarines violate by abandon­
ing the crews of sunken ships to the
mercy of the waves far from land.
CAUSES SURPRISE.

Washington, Dec. 29.—Spain's action
toward the German submarine cam­

which the state department considers

Unconditional Withdrawal Is Pos­

ASKS MODIFICATION
OF THE PROTOCOL
(Associated Press)
Washington, Dec. 29.—General Car
ranza's latest communication asking
modification of the protocol covering
Withdrawal of American troops from
Mexico was examined closely today by
Secretary Lane, chairman of the Amer­
ican members of the American com­
mission, who has summoned his col­
leagues to confer with him here as
soon as possible. They will decide
what answer to give the Mexican re­
presentatives when another session of
the commission is held next week.
Although the document has not been
made public, it was said General Car
ranza's insistence on the unconditional
retirement of the American forces is
not so strong as formerly, chiefly be­
cause of the new military situation in
northern Mexico.
MAY GIVE IN.
(United Press.)
Washington, Dec. 29.—The United
States government, today found itself
in a quarry of diplomatic negotiations
regarding Mexico.
The administration must decide
whether it will stand by its guns and
tell the Carranza government that
the Mexican-American peace confer­
ence has been automatically ended by
his refusal to sign the peace protocol,
or whether they will continue to give
the administration of Mexico more
time for consideration.
That this government is about to re­
lax its position in the Carranza proto­
col incident and make concessions to
Carranza, in connection with the with­
drawal of the expeditionary forces was
a common belief here this afternoon.
Congressional circles suggested that
Pershing's columns should be with­
drawn, irrespective of any protocol ne­
gotiations. Military men admitted
there are no military reasons for Per­
shing's column to remain where it is.
CUT RAILWAY LINES.

Scalpers Reaping Rich
Harvest From Car
Shortage Says Crites
scalpers, are forced to sell to line ele­

of the crop is marketed, shippers are
having great trouble getting cars.
Scalpers are offering to buy grain at
from 3c to 5c below the market price,
and farmers are often willing to sell
on account of the shortage of cars.
Producers are thus put at the mercy of
the shippers, Crites said.

Unusual optimism is shown
here as a result of thi final form
which the reply has taken,

it will meet with satisfaction at

This was the statement of a high

United States, in so acting, is merely
acting in the capacity of a messenger.
He expressed the idea tjiat Germany
was probably trying todntW the Unit­

upon the baBis Germany suggested.
Bungled by Lansing.
The idea of a break with Germany
on account of submarine issues seem­
ed to grow here today. There was an
undercurrent opinion that the German
peace answer is insincere and that
there is little chance of the Entente
allies meeting the German proposal.
Fears that an unbridled' submarine
war would follow was expressed in
diplomatic circles.
British Ambassador Spring Rice
said today that the Entente allies
would never consent to German poace
talk as stated, in the German reply.
There was some talk today among
congressmen that negotiations had
been bungled through Secretary Lan­
sing. They said that Lansing had ho
need of fear that the neutrality of the
United States would be abandoned if
international law were kept.

Berlin, Dec. 29.—Judging from the
unofficial report from all fronts, peace
efforts of President Wilson and Switz­
erland will not succeed immediately
in bringing an end to hostilities, until
there has been another great Allied
movement.
Reports here today indicate a gen­
eral artillery preparation. Indications
are that England, in the west, the
Balkans in the vicinity of Saloniki,
and Russia in the East are preparing
to accept Hindenberg's challenge for
a bitter fight. Peace talk will then
recede, it is considered probable.
Another Test.
It is doubted if the issue will be
brought up again until the fall, when
the Allies' strength in men and steel
will have been tested. That this test
will meet, with failure for the Entente
Allies is taken as a matter of course
in Berlin.
In the West, there has been consid­
erable artillery activity, newspapers
report. The greatest activity was re­
ported today from Lile to Ypres. A
great English offensive is expected.
"Our forces in Roumania," says a
newspaper today, "are in close touch
with the enemy. Large numbers of
prisoners have been taken. In Mace­
donia something is apparently develop­
ing. General Sarrail seems to have
turned back to his original plan of
breaking our lines in the centers fol­
lowing his unsuccessful effort to break
