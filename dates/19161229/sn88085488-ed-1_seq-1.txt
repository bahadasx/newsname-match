VOLUME XXIX
CLAIM BETRAYAL
BY PULLMAN MAN
Portland Pajier Suys Ray Loomis,
\v. S. C. Player, Informed Penn
sylvania Coach of Oregon's
Style of Play
•Claiming that Ray Loom Is, star
State College end and the only local
man to make the all-Northwest
team, visited Coach Folwell of the
Pennsylvania football team and gave
all the information at his command
concerning the style or play used by
the Oregon University team, Port
land fans are up In arms at the al
leged action of Loom Is, and the Rose
City papers are giving the sensa
tional end a severe panning. Loom is
is at present in Pittsburg, where he
went to attend a national convention
of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fratern
ity, and while it would have been
possible for him to give the Informa
tion, local fans are not inclined to
place credence in the story until
further proof is at hand, although
they are almost unanimous in the
contention that such action would
not come within the hounds of true
sportsmanship.
The following story concerning the
alleged betrayal of the style of play
used by Coach Besdek's men ap
peared in the Portland Oregonian:
Must before leaving for Pasadena
the University of Pennsylvania foot
ball squad received a visit from a
young mail who represented himself
as Loomis, end on the Washington
State College team, who put in two
hours explaining Oregon's system of
attack and defense to the Quakers,
and offering suggestions as to what
tactics Coach well's men should
I adopt to defeat Oregon on New
Year's day. The Pennsylvania
players and coaches listened atten
tively to Loomis and declared they
had profited materially by his advice.
"In a signed article in the Phila
delphia Press Fol well said:
"'He (Loomis) Knows every man
on the team Pennsylvania will meet
and all their plays, and he spent two
I hours going over in detail all the In
formation we had compiled about
our opponents. He added to this very
materially, and we feel that he has
'been of the utmost assistance to us.'
"Eastern college men who have
heard of the Loomis incident are
loud in their disapproval of his dis
loyalty to Pacific coast football by
putting the Pennsylvanians wise as
to Oregon's play. Alumni of east
ern colleges have been supporting
Pennsylvania in the coming game as
fa matter of sectional pride, but they
believe Oregon is entitled to tin
loyal support of all Pacific coast in
stitutions and players. Since the
t Loomis incident many easterners
have denounced the Pennsylvanians
for having given the Washington
Player an audience."
in commenting on the Incident,
Coach Lonestar Dietz contended that J
the story would prove to be the ex- j
aggeration of some "fertile brained j
newspaper man, who juggled the
facts to make a sensational story," |
and that when the true facts were
known it would probably prove that
Loomis, instead of rushing to the i
Pennsylvania mentor with informa
tion concerning the western team,
was doubtless sought out by Fol
well and naturally answered the
questions propounded to him.
Pennsylvania and Oregon meet at
Pasadena on New Years day, and the
big majority of the Pullman fans
are boosting for an Oregon victory. if !
only to strengthen the proof pro
tided by the Washington State team !
last New Years day when Dletz's
men won from Brown University in j
Hie first intersectional game, that
western football is Just as good or j
better than that of the east.
Assistant Coach Zlegler, who has j
.charge of the California line,'
■scouted at the Oregon-Washington \
game, and Coach Dletz claims that in
all probability all the Information
concerning ' Oregon's play came
through., him, rather than through
Loomis.
The high school basket ball sched
ule calls for two games with Endi-
c ot, two with Moscow, two with
Johnson, two with Waitsburg. two
i*lth W. S. C. Preps, probably two
with Walla Walla, and another with
Palouse.

Basket Ball Quintet Overcomes Three
Points Lead in Second Half ami
Scores Six Point Victory
First hall Palouse high sdiool,

Final score Pullman, 24, Pa
louse, is.
Those figures tell the story of one
of the most sensational second half
"comebacks" ever staged on the local
high school gymnasium floor, and the
members of Coach Savage's quintet
deserve much credit for their won
derful plr.y in the final period, which
took the local team one step nearer
the coveted Whitman county cham
pionship. The whirlwind finish was
all the more noteworthy because of
tin absence from the lineup of Me-
Iver, the star of the team, who was
forced to retire because of sickness.
The visitors took the lead early in
the first half through the sensational
basket shooting of Fran/.en, their
center, who, however, was systemat- I
ically smothered by the Pullman
guards when the second half spurt
that spelled victory was started. The
entire Pullman team played good
basket hall liter they once got to go
ing, and it would be hard to pick in
dividual star., although Mclver and
Douglass shone brightly. Mclver
was badly off in his free throws, an
nexing only two in six attempts.

Washington State College will

j William 11. iLonestar) Diet/ for next
year, although the coach has not yet
! given a finite answer to the ath
letic department following their of
fer of 13000 lor his services. Sev
eral eastern Institutions are hot on
the trail of the Pullman man, one
school having offered a contract call

years, $3000 f or the ,j,. al year, with
an increase of ff,ou both the second
and third years. Diet/ strongly fa
vors a long-time contract, ami in all
probability the local ante will have

offered to insure his return next
year. lie has promised to give a
definite answer by the first of the
year, and all indications point to the
probability of a negative reply unless
the athletic department can see its
way clear to increase its offer in the
meantime. The athletic department
steadfastly maintains that $3000 is
the maximum salary it can pay tor a
football coach, and as yet no steps
have been taken to raise an added
sum oUtsid3 the college, as was done
last year, when the alumni guaran
teed $1000 of the $4000 paid Coach
Dletz for bis services,
i A large number of applications for
the positioa, in case Coach Diet/, de
cides to go elsewhere, have already
i been received by college authorities.
While it is claimed that neither bus
made a direct application for the po
sition, Jim Thorpe and Exendine are
both being prominently mentioned as
a successor to Coach Diets, and
either would be in a position to fol

cessfully employed by Coach licit/.
Both are Carlisle men, and former
teammates of Diet/. Jim Thorpe is
iat present under contract with New
York, in the National baseball
league, while Exendine is coaching
football at Georgetown.
A slight ray of hope was injected
into the situation this week through
the suggestion of local fans that two
purses of $500 each he made up, one
to be given to Coach Diet/ in addi
tion to his $11000 salary in case he
wins the Washington game, and the
other bonus to be contingent upon a
victory over Oregon University.
Victories over Washington and Ore
gon would be well worth $1000 to
followers of the game, and it .is
thought that little difficulty would
be encountered in raising the guar

High School Adds lo Equipment
' Additions to Manual Training De
partment Place Local School Willi
the Best otf Its Size ill That
Line
Taking advantage of the Christmas
vacation, needed improvements are
being made in the manual training
department of the high school. The
additions to the equipment of the de
partment include a large band saw
and adequate electrical power equip
ment, as well as numerous minor de
tails, the total cost to range between
$350 and $400. The improvements
! will place Piillma.i high school among
the leaders in eastern Washington in
point of equipment and efficiency of
the manual training department, and
will make it possible for the stu
dents to accomplish a maximum
amount of work in the limited time
- alloted.
The new band saw will make pos
sible the manufacture by the stu
dents of far greater range of articles
and articles much larger in size than
was possible with the former equip
ment. Under the former adverse
i conditions, however, the students
have turned out elegant office desks,
library tables and buffets, as well
I as other large articles, thus forecast
ing the possibilities under modern
I equipment.
The manual training department
has been brought to a high state of
i efficiency under the direction of Mr.
Mit himself either as favorable or
adverse to the proposition, merely
stating that he had nothing to say
until the offer was made to him. It
is believed, however, thai he would
accept such a proposition were it
made.
Coach Diet/ will leave soon after
the first of the year tor the cast.

troupe. He will go first to Minne

eastern points.
Football enthusiasts who have fol

almost unanimous In their support
of Dietz for the local coaching Job

KIXCAIDS ARE HOSTS
Among the many happy and joy
ous week-end and Christmas parties
was that at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
C. 11. Klncaid, near Chambers sta
tion. The festivities lasted from
Saturday until Tuesday. The Christ
mas dinner included a 20-pound tur
key and numerous other delicacies
for which the Kincaid home is famed.
Among those who enjoyed the Kin
caid hospitality were Mr. and Mm.
Win. Klncaid, Mr. and Mrs. C. S. hill.
Anita Klncaid, lack Klncaid, Mr,
Christian. Dr. E. E. Wegner, and last
but not least, Mart Taylor, the es
teemed veteran of the Civil war,
who still wears the blue as proudly
as he did in '62,
Ilevley, who this year has charge of
the work, and the excellent work of
the students has attracted wide atten
tion, which, in turn, has given rise
to the general clamor for better fa
cilities, which is now being realized.
In former years the work has been
confined more or less to the manu
facture of small articles, such as |
necktie holders, match scratcbers, an j
occasional cedar chest and a few li
brary tables. Now the store room ,
of the shop resembles a furniture
store, being equipped with exception
ally well made piano benches, music
cabinets, office desks, sewing tables,
bedroom sets, and a large number of;
tables, cabarets. footstools and j
library furnishings. The by-word of
the students of the department has
changed from Manual Torture" to:
"Manual Pleasure."
Credit for the great change In the
department must go to Mr. Ilevley.
whose systematic Instruction and
painstaking care have inspired the
members of the class to their best ef
forts and created an atmosphere of (
industry.
Gum wood has come Into use In
the department this year, and oak Is f
being used In larger quantity, mak
ing possible a variety of work that Is
not only durable but. beautiful. The j
shops are kept open after school un
til 5:00 o'clock or later, as well as
on Saturdays, giving the boys a prof
itable method of employing their
leisure hours, and many lake ad
vantage of the privilege.
