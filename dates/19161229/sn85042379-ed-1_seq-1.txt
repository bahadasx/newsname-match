CAUSE OF DEATH UNKNOWN
Was Getting House Ready for Com- '
ing of His Family.. Had Been
Missing for About 10 Days
I
There was no happy homecoming
for Mrs. Guy Tibbs and her three
children when she arrived in Glasgow '
Wednesday night. They came know- ]
ing that the one they loved best was
dead; that their coming would be one
of sorrow instead of gladness, as had
been planned months before. j
About one o'clock Wednesday aft- j
ernoon, the body of Guy Tibbs was
found on the floor of the residence I
he had rented on Fourth avenue
north. The bhastly discovery had
been made by R. J. Moore, who notic
ing Tibbs' absence, thought he would
go over to the house to see how it
was being arranged for the homecom
ing of Mrs. Tibbs and the children.
About a month ago Mr. Tibbs re- !
turned to Glasgow and took a position |
with the Great Northern. Four or;
five years ago he had been a con-1
ductor here, but on account of a train
wreck, he had lost his rights and then I
went to Three Forks where he worked !
for the Milwaukee. He prospered
there and bought a home, but Mrs. |
Tibbs longed for the day they could
return to Glasgow. Mr. Tibbs left j
Three Forks, and rented his home of
Mr. and Mrs. Chas. Hoffman, formerly,
of this city. He rented a house on
the north side from Roy Johnson and
planned to have it furnished and
ready for the arrival of his family.
Since coming to the city he had
been rooming at R. J. Moore's resi- j
dence, and they knew of his intentions
to fix up the house for his family.
Last Friday Mr. nad Mis. Moore i
left for Sidney to spend the holidays, :
and Monday, on their return, they
noticed that Mr. Tibbs room had not
been occupied. Thinking that he was
over at the other house they paid
île attention to it at first, but his con
tinued absence made Mr. Moore curi-!
ous. Tuesday he inquired at the yard
office and found that Mr. Tibbs had
laid off about the 17th of December
and had not been seen since. He de-i
oided to follow the matter up and
went over to the house which Tibbs
had rented and there found him dead. ■
Taking a careful note of the sur- j
roundings and making sure that '
there had been no scuffle or foul play, 1
Mr. Moore notified the coroner and j
together they made an investigation. |
The body was lying on the kitchen !
floor, about a foot from the door and
from its condition, it is thought Tibbs
must have been dead for over a week,
as the body was frozen stiff and mice
hnd gnawed at his «„gars and thai«
to" of his head. Ha wa, in his worh
^
on tne noor.
The body was taken to the morgue i
and an inquest was held Thursday
morning, but the jury withheld their
verdict until additional «tvidence
could be obtained.
Mrs. Tibbs and the three children,
Harry Tibbs and Fay Tibbs, brothers
af the deceased, are in the city and

At a meeting of the board of di -j
rectors of the Johnson Farm Loan Co. !
of this city, and the Sheridan County
Abstract Co. of PYlentywood, C. C.
Johnson was elected to fill the offices
made vacant by the death of R. E.
Johnson.
Mr. C. C. Johnson was formerly
vice president of the tw concerns and
has had the active management of;
the Glasgow office, while Roy John
son, who has held the position of sec
retary of the companies, is now vice
president. Harry Johnson has been
elected secretary, being the new offi
cer in the companies.
Despite the fact that the founder
of the two concerns has passed away,
the business will go on as before
without any change in policy. During
recent years, Mr. R. E. Johnson has
let the bulk of the responsibilities set
tle on the shoulders of his two asso
ciates, and they have practically han
dled the business themselves. While

FUNERAL WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON
Hundreds of Friends Mourn His Loss at FuneraL
Early Christmas Evening. Career Was
Very Successful
Death Came

Christmas day, Richard E
Glasgow has lost another pioneer,
Another prominent business man has
answered the call to the Great Be
Johnson ;
passed away at his home on the north
side, after an illness of a few days
which had first been diagnosed as
la grippe, but which later turned
into pneumonia.
I About a week before his death Mr.
Johnson contracted a cold and when i
symptoms of la grippe appeared he
remained at home to recover. But
not being in the best of health and
unable to withstand the disease, he
became worse from day to day, until
he quietly passed away about six
o'clock on Christmas day.
The news of his death came as a
thunderbolt from a clear sky to the
majority of the people of the city
who knew and loved "Dick" Johnson:
Many of them did not even know of
his illness, and the news of his death
was a severe blow.
Roy Johnson, a brother in law of
the deceased and Harry Johnson, a
nephew, both of Plentywood, were
and arrived Tuesday and
I notified,
j Mrs. E. Halgren of Watertown, Min
-'nesota, arrived Wednesday morning,
1 A niece, Mrs. E. Lovelace of Hebron,
D. f wired that she was coming,
-bi did not arrive in time for the
funeral.
I
The funeral was held Wednesday
afternoon from the residence on the
north side, and despite the bitter cold
and deep snow, hundreds of .Mend«
packed the house to do homage for
the last time to a man who had many
times proved a true friend.
The services were in charge of the
local Masonic lodge, of which the de
ceased was a member, and he had but
recently become a Shriner, receiving
his degree on a visit to Helena a few
weeks ago. The members of the local
order attended in a body at the home
and also at the grave.
That the deceased had looked for
ward to the day of his death was evi
denced by a slip of paper found on
his desk on which were instructions
as to how his funeral should be con
ducted. It was written some time,
for after the death of his wife, Mr.
j j h , health was never verv «rood
and|^

T !» 8 « *> " the servic< "
made every effort to carry out the
wishes of the deceased to the minutest

The same kind of a casket
which his wife had been buried in was
selected for him, the same minister
presided, and the same musical selec
! t' 0113 were rendered, as at the funeral
; two years ago.

funeral, and were sent to the local
hospital.

Don't Waste Any Water

age of seventeen he came to Glas

gow and entered the employ of the
Lewis-Wedum company, where he,
was a clerk for a short time and then |
returned to Minnesota and entered I
the employ of Wilcox & Willis store
. h « m ,. , ■
at Hancock. This was a significant i
. .. , , ,
step in his career, for there he met 1
*«• **• , , , , I
Miss Marie Johnson, who was post
, y x ,
mistress and there began a love match
which will never end.
After a few months he returned to
Glasgow and had charge of the post
office and books in Lewis-Wedum
store for nearly three years and then
was cashier and bookkeeper of the
Lewis Bros. bank.
April 5, 1904, Richard and Marie
were married in the old farm home
near Hancock, Minnesota, and there
began what was, as near as earth
can give it, an earthly paradise. At
first the young pair lived at Glen- j
wood, Minnesota, for the summer. In
the fall they moved to Flaxton, N. I>., j
where Richard and others established
the First State Bank of Flaxton. A!
year later they moved to the new
i town of Rolette, N. D., where Mrs.
Johnson was the first woman. Here
Dick was cashier and stockholder of
the First State Bank of Rolette. Here
they built a new home, which was an
inspiration to the new town which
sprang up in a year.
From Rolette they came to Glas
gow where he purchased an abstract
company which he named and later I
I Abstract company, of which he was
president..
In the month of March, 1913, he in
icorporated the Sheridan County Ab
! stract company at Plentywood, Mon
tana, of which he was president. In
February, 1915, he assisted in form
ing the Phillips County Abstract com
pany which, in April of that year, was
disposed of to parties in Malta, and
the abstract department of the Val
i ley County Abstract company dis
! posed of to a local firm in Glasgow.
11 ne remaining department of the
business was retained and incorpo
rated as the Johnson Farm Loan com
I pany, of which he was president. Dur
j ing the past year, with others, he
formed the Stock-Growers Bank of
Glasgow, to which he was elected
president.
At Glasgow another inspirational
home was built with high hopes and
deep joy. But after five years, this
joy was turned to deepest sorrow

ers Also Progressing
During the past four years one
fo urth of all the land taken up in the
United States on homesteads, desert
tracts, railroad land and other tracts
open to settlement was taken up in
Montana > according to Alfred Atkin
son ' 8tate . agronomist, and head of
experiment farms conducted un
der the auspices of the state agricul
tural college. During that time 109,
000 filings were made in Montana,
each representing from 160 to 320
acres or larger tracts. The cost of
taking up the tracts and improving
them varies from a few hundred to
several thousand dollars.
The department is operating five
widely different experimental farms
in Montana, each a study in different
conditions in various parts of the
8ta te, and it is the hope of Mr. At
kinson and his associates to get an
appropriation from the next legisla
ture for two more stations, one in
the Flathead and one in the far east
ern part of the state.
"The first work of the department
was to show the people what could
be done with dry land farming meth
ods. The first steps were taken 13
years ago, and now it has become a
question of what methods and rota
tion of crops will secure the better
. , .
results. "The success of the dry land

Partment has conducted five expen
ment stations. One of them is a dry
farm at Bozeipan. Another has been
estabHShed *t Huntley, and both the
irrigation and dry farm station near
Moccasin, in the central of the Judith
basin.
"At Fort Assinniboine, south of
Havre, the department has 2,000 acres
and $1,000,000 worth of buildings
which were sold to the state for $5,000
when the federal government with
drew from the fort.
"We are conducting a fruit station
at Victor in the Bitter Root. Each
