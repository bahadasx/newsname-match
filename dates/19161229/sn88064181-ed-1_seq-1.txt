"STATE YOUR TERMS,"
ANSWER TO KAISER
GUARANTEES FOR PEACE OF EU.
ROPE NEEDED, SAYS PREMIER
-REPARATION PARAMOUNT.
London.--"Tell us your terms!
"Give us guarantees for the peace of
Europe from the swashbuckling of
Prussian militarism-guarantees surer
than those you have broken!
"Then, and not until then, will the
allies treat with you with regard to
ending the war!"
Reduced to its sum and substance,
that is the answer of Great Britain and
her allies to the central powers' proe
posal to enter Into negotiations for
peace. It was given by Lloyd-George
in the House of Commons.
As for the allies' terms-the only
terms on which they will give peace
negotiations a thought-the premier
set them down thus:
"Without reparation peace is impos
sible. The allies insist that the only
end of the war must be complete guar
antee against Prussian militarism dis
turbing the peace of Europe."
And with a ringing note of bitter
irony he added:
"All the outrages on land and sea
cannot be liquidated by a few pious
phrases about humanity."
At the pinnacle of his political ca
reer, in his debut before the House of
Parliament as premier and virtual war
dictator of Great Britain, Lloyd-George
delivered his long-expected address be
fore a house thronged to its capacity
and amid deep, almost reverential sr
lence, which was, however, broken re
peatedly by thunderous cheering.
The substance of his declaration, he
announced, would be sent to Germany
within a few days. It was not only
England's answer, the prime minister
emphasized. It was England's "clean
and definite" support to the identical
statements already given by Russia
and France.
It was not a flat-footed, defiant re
jection of peace, this remarkable
speech by England's "strongest man,"
which the world had waited breath
lessly for eight anxious days.
It was an unqualified, scornful, al
most contemptuous rejection of the
central powers' proffer as it now
stands. For this proffer. In its present
shape, is a "nose, with the rope's end
in Germany's hands"-thus Lloyd
George described it-and the allies "do
not propose to put their heads into it."
Newspaper presses were still rolling
off extra editions containing the pre
mier's speech--a new edition for each
succeeding paragraph-when the
cables brought from Paris the' news
that Aristide Briand, the French pre
'mier; had announced in the Senate
that the entente would send a joint
reply to the central powers, making
It known that "It is impossible to take
their request for peace seriously."
Earlier the word had come from
Petrograd that the council of the Rus
slan Empire had decided unanimously
to favor a categorial refusal of the
allies to enter peace negotiatios wit
Germany.
