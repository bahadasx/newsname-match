Escape for Rockwood Boys
Yesterday Morning
When Gas Engine on Rockwood

Oil, Explodes.
Jofin and Harry Rockwood mlrac
uloiiHly escaped serious lnjiiry, If not
doath, about flpe o'clock yesterday
morning, when" a gas engine, used in
pumping an oil well on the Albert
Rockwood farm, two and a half miles
northwest of town, exploded, blowing
heavy pieces of iron and wood sev
eral hundred reot. Luckily only a
small piece of wood struck Harry,
Inflicting an ugly flesh wound, but
breaking no bones, John had Just
entered a shed some distance from
the engine and was uninjured. Both
boys had left the engine only a few
minutes before it blew up. - The
shock of the explosion was plainly
felt in this city, even in the extreme
east end. f rjj

"We have no ' objection to our

Dress Is much to the girl what
whisky and gambling are to the boy.
It is her greatest temptation. And
It Is right that the great commercial
enterprises of the country should do
all in their power to control what has
ruined many a girl s life.
When mothers let little girls at
tend school attired as we see them
every day, it Is well that there be In
the land some influence to teach girls
the meaning of that expression "com
mon decency," which was in common
use in grandmother's day but has
since fallen somewhat into disrepute.

The Newark Advocate, one of the
oldest and best known newspapers in
Central Ohio came out Thursday of
last week with this announcement:
"On and after January 1, which
marks the expiration of existing con
tracts, no liquor advertising will ap
pear in the columns of the Newark
Advocate. This action Is taken In def
erence to the desire of a large num
ber of our patrons and in accordance
with the spirit of the times."
Those persons who do not know
the Newark of today would think of
it only in 'connection with the wet
riots and lynching of a few years ago.
and will wonder at The Advocate
taking such a step. The paper is
merely keeping abreast with the

their appreciation. American Isue.

10.
Kounnke, Virginia, an eccentric and learn
i d lawyer, statesman und diplomat, rec
oRUized us one of the historical person
iK' s of the United States.
There are still living forty-seven of the
original hody of some four hundred and
more slaves and more than three hun
dred descendants.
The case Is rich In historic Incidents,
iittenUinir the period immediately Drior to
the Civil War, and wHs made very diffi
cult to unravel owing to the fact that
the original will of Randolph, and many
valuable records and deeds were destroy
ed by the burning of the Court-House at
the evacuation of the City of Richmond,
April 3, 1865.
On .May 24, 1833, John Randolph, of
ftoanoke, one time Attorney General of
the United States,' an extensive slave
holder, died unmarried and childless,
leaving a very large estate, both real and
persanal. He drew his own will Decem
ber 6, 1821, and afterwards added seven
different codicils.
While endeavoring to find Information
for the suits above referred to a thor
ough search was made of the Records of
Richmond, of those of Charlotte County,
where Randolph died; and at Halifax,
where his executor, Leigh, died. The
search was then pursued to the County
of James City, and the City of Williams
burg, and from there to Petersburg,
where in a Collateral proceeding a copy
of the will was accidentally discovered.
The will and codicils are very lengthy.
but full of many Interestine facts. The
llrst two paragraphs gave rise to the
suit now pending. The will, in part. Is
is follows:
"In the Name of God, Amen!
"I, John Randolph, of Roanoke, do or
dain this my last will and testament,
hereby revoking all other wills whatso
ever:
'I give and bequeath to all my slaves
their freedom, heartily regretting that I
have ever been the owner of one.
I give to my executor a sum not ex
ceeding eight thousand dollars, or so
much thereof as may be necessary to
transport and settle said slaves to and in
some other state or territory of the U. S.
giving to all above the age of forty, not
less than ten acres of land each.
"To my old and faithful servants. Ex-
sex and his wife, Hetty, who I trust may
be suffered to remain in the State, I give
and bequeath three and a half barrels of
corn, two hundred weight of pork, a pair
of strong shoes, a suit of clothes and a
blanket each, to be paid them annually:
ilso an annual hat to Essex, and ten
pounds of coffee and twenty pounds of
brown sugar.
To William Leigh (Note by writer At
one time Judge of the Superior Court of
Virginia), of Halifax County, Virginia, I
bequeath to him and to his heirs forever,
all the land on which I live lying between
the Owen's ferry road and Carrington's,
Cook's, Llpscombs' and Morton's lines.
"The land above the Owen's ferry road
and the lower quarter, and the land I
bought of the Read's to be sold at my
said Executor's discretion, and what ever
moneys over and above my debts I give
and bequeath to PYancis Scott Key (Note
by writer Author of the Star Spangled
Banner) to be disposed of toward better
ing the condition of my manumitted
slaves.
"I give and bequeath to my said Execu
tor, William Leigh ,all my books, maps,
pictures, ic, except three folio manu
script volutnns bound In parchment, which
I bequeath to the masters and fellows and
their successors of Trinity College, Cam
bridge, Old England, the first college of
the first University of the World. The
folio volumns of the manuscript bound in
parchment referred to contain the rec
ords of the Old London Company.
"As lawyers and courts of law are ex
tremely addicted to making wills for
dead men which they never made when
living, it Is my will and desire that no
person who shall set aside or attmpt to
set aside the will above referred to shall
ever Inherit, possess or enjoy any part of
my estate, real or personal."
Under date of August 26, 1831, at War
rick street, Charing Cro., London, the
following codicil, in part was made:
"On the eve of embarking for the Un
ited S considering my feeble health, to
say nothing of the danger of the seaa,;. I
