CLARK C. FITTS
Brilliant Vermont Lawyer Dies
at the Age of 47 Years Ver
mont's First Attorney-General.
Clarke C. Fitts, of Brattleboro,
died Wednesday evening, Dec. 20, at
the home of his sister-in-law, Mrs.
Otis, in Watertown, Mass., aged 46
years. He was operated upon No
vember 8 in the Ccrey Hill hospital
at Brookline, Mass., for an intestinal
trouble. Thanksgiving day he was
moved to Watertown. He showed
improvement for a time, but com
plications set in and for the past two
days there had been no hope.
By the death of Clarke Cushing
Fitts, Brattleboro loses a man who
had been most prominent in the af
fairs of the town and of the State
in the last 15 years. During that
period Mr. Fitts had a prominent
part in the bringing to a successful
head more large enterprises than
any one other resident of the town.
This he did in addition to handling a
very large and lucrative law prac
tice which he had built up by leaps
and bounds almost from the time of
his admission to the Vermont bar at
the age of 21 years. He was counsel
for many large interests. He was
born in Wardsboro, October 17,1870,
a son of Osmer C. and Abbie M.
(Twitchell) Fitts. His father died
when he was 14 years of age. After
a few terms in the Leland and Gray
Seminary and one year in the Brat
tleboro high school, from which he
graduated, he entered the law office
of Waterman, Martin & Hitt as a
law student and was admitted to the
bar October 21, 1891, four days after
he became of age. Three years
after being admitted to the bar he
was elected State's attorney of
Windham county and vigorously
prosecuted such offenses as came
under his jurisdiction and was espec
ially active in his work against those
who sold liquor illegally.
The new railroad station complet
ed this year1 and the changing of the
grade of Vernon street.Brattleboro,
involving the expenditures of sever
al scores of thousands, was due to
his persistence and ability as counsel
for the local committeer" It involved
years of effort.
In 1904 he was elected town repre
sentative and after three months'
service was elected the first attorney
general of the State, an office created
Dy the Legislature ot which he was
a member. He was re-elected for a
second term of two years. During
his career in that office occurred the
trial of Mary Rogers of Bennington
and her subsequent conviction and
hanging. In this case an array of
brilliant counsel opposed the young
attorney-general. This was his last
political appointment.
tie was a staunch republican in
politics and of late years had been
much sought as a campaign speaker
It was while engaged in the national
campaign of this year in New York
State that he was taken ill and
forced to abandon his assignments
He was a member of the Center
Congregational church, a vice-presi
dent of the Greater Vermont associ
ation, ex-president of the Vermont
Bar association, a trustee of the
Brattleboro Savings bank, a director
of the PeopleV National bank,
director of the S. A. Smith Manufac
turing company and of the Hooker
Corser & Mitchell company, a mem
ber of the Masonic fraternity and of
the Red Men, of the Brattleboro
Country club and the Vermont
Wheel club.
Mr. Fitts first married in 1893
Miss Harrett Lyon of Londonderry
who died in 1897. He leaves two
sons by that marriage, Robert I
student in the Harvard Law school
and Stanley C, a student at Dart
mouth College. In 1903 Mr. Fitt
married for his second wife Miss
Maud L. Emerson of Brattleboro
who survives with a son, Osmer C
and a daughter, Miriam. He leaves
also his mother and two sisters, Miss
Mary and Miss Florence, all of Brat
tleboro. Hermon E. Eddy, just
elected State senator, and Harold E
Whitney were his associates in his
practice.
BRIGHTON'S REPRESENTATIVE
Some Incidents In the Life of
J. S.Sweeney, Who Will Repre
sent This Town in the Legisla
ture that Co'nvenes January3d.
Brighton's representative, J. S.
Sweeney, isa man of affairs. He is
interested in local industries and na
tive in their successful operation.
He believes in the advancement of
all public work that is for the uplift
and betterment of the people.
John S. Sweeney was born in Can
ada in 1851, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
ranklin Sweeney. He came to
Charleston in 1863, when 12 years of
age, and went to work tor iMiphaiec
rescott on a farm. He was educa
ted in the public schools of that day
and worked farming, in mills and
stores. He bougH a store and con
ducted a mercantile business from
1870 to 1898 in Charleston. 1
In 1875 he married Miss Rose Ste
vens of Charleston, daughter of Col.
D. Stevens. One daughter was
born to th m, Iva, the wife of Dr.
A. E. Parlin of this place, and they
have an adopted daughter, Mis
sefa Chappell, a trained nurse of
St. Johnsbury.
Mr. Sweeney was very active in
the businpss enterprises of Charles-'
ten, and fulfilled his duties as a citi
zen, winning the confidence and es-'
teem of his townsmen. He held every j
office in the administration of town
affairs in Charleston except that of
town clerk, and was plected repre
sentative from that town in 1888.
He held the office of postmaster from
1875 to 1898, except during the ad
ministration of Grover Cleveland.
n 1898 he came to Island Pond and
has taken an active part in the in
dustrial progress and community
uplift of the placev ' For two y? rs
he was foreman for the Fitzgeraid
umber Company. He entered into
the real estate business with Porter
Dale, soon after moving to town ,
and the partnership continues at the
present time. He was in company
with Porter H. Dale, L. A. Cobb and
O
S. Eaton in developing the electric
ight plant at Charleston and con
tinues an active member of that
corporation. He was a charter
member of the Island Pond National
Bank and is at the present time its
vice president. He was postmaster
here for eight years and is the pres
ent commissioner of the unorganized
towns and gores in Essex county.
Mr. Sweeney was active in devel
oping thePeople's telephone line and
was associated with Sidney Fletcher
of Holland, C. S. Henman of Charles
ton and Frank Moore of Morgan in
this work. This was one of the first
telephone linns in this section and
Mr. Sweeney installed the first pri
vate telephone in this place in his
home. Later this line was -sold to
George Valley, who sold to O. T.
Davis. Mr. Davis sold to the Pas
sumpsic Telephone company, which
today is the only telephone system
in operation here.
Mr. Sweeney is a steward and
trustee of the Methodist church and
a very active worker of that society.
He was thrown on his own resources
at an early age, his home being
broken up by his father goig to t e
front in 1862, as a member of the
Massachusetts heavy artillery. He
served through the war, and soon
after returning home died from the
hardships of the service. Thus win
ning his way "by perseverence, in
tegrity, geniality, and sympathetic
helpful interest in, his fe.lowmen, he
has become a citizen esteemed and
respected by his feliowtownsmen. and
the large number with whom his ex
ten&ive business dealings has brought
him in contact, and in every sense of
the term is a self-made man. This
is the man Brighton sends to the
legislature and he will bean earnest,
conscientious worker in that body.

HEAD-ON COLLISION
On Grand Trunk Railway at
West Bethel Kills Four Train
men and Engineer Chase Is in
the Hospital Seriously Injured.
Four trainmen were killed in a
head-on collision on the Grand
Yrunk railway at West- Bethel, Me.,
late Sunday night, and engineer
W. L. Chase is in a hospital at Ber
lin, N. H., suffering1 from burns and
injuries which at first were reported
fatal, and while his condition is
critical, physicians pay he has a
chance for recovery. Chase is badly
burned about the entire body, but
no bones were broken. The four
trainmen killed in the "wreck were
Leon Corliss, engineer, E. P. Wilder,
fireman, L. B. Pike, brakeman, all
of Island Pond, and Hermon C. Ter
rison of East Deering, Me.
lhc collision occurred on what is
known as an opposite curve, and the
trains met in the woods in an isolated
section of the ro d. Tho cas bound
freight left Islt.nd Poi i Sunday and
was a heavy tiain with a heavy en
gine of the M kade t j e, with en
gineer W. L. Cli; s and fireman
Hermon C. Ten sor, and conductor
Wentworih. The westbound train
was lighter with engineer Li on Cor
liss and fireman E P. Wilder on the
engin". lhe torce ot the impact
was such as to reduce almost to
kindling-wood ten cars on the west
bound and seven cars on the east
bound and comp'eU'ly wrecked both
engines. The engi ieer, fireman and
brakeman on the westbound and
fireman on the eastbound were
caught in the wreckage which was
soon ablaze. The four bodies,
burned beyond recognition, were re
wered from the burniner wreckage
many hu of careful pnd
thorough search Engineer Chase
saved his life by jumping but was
caught in the wreckage from his
engine and fearfully burned.
Telegraph poles were broken
down and traffic was at a standstill
for many hour?.
The first news of the wreck reach
ed West Bethel when brakeman
Burbank of the westbound train,
walked three miles to that station.
The cause of the wreck is under
stood to have been a misunderstand
ing of the orders.and that the trains
should have passed at Gilead, ten
miles west of Bethel.
editorial column of the Rutland
Daily Herald of December 14:
"In mentioning the fact that he is
not to be a candidate for the, office
of Sergeant-at-Arms, Publisher Par
sons of the Northfield News nomi
nates Dwight J. Dwinell. Would it
not be well to let the legislature
look over the other candidates a
trifle, say Mr. W. E. Poole of
Montpelier?"
The Herald received its inspiration
for the above from an editorial that
appeared in the Northfield News of
December 12th, wherein Sergeant-at-Arms
Parsons, the editor of the
News, assumes a dictatorial attitude
by naming his own successor.
Sergeant-at-Arms I'arsimshas held
on to his statehouse job since ac
quiring the editoiship of the North
geld News last Au'ibt as well as
since acquiring a re.-idence in North-
field. There is tin 1; w ngninst this
transacti n; t t lu.s l en the cus
tom that ihi-S. geant t Amis ho d
residence in t! e c pita. city. This,
however, is crn and readily ex
cused. The cikicitim wh ch is made
and which is well founded is expres
sed in the editorial iatagiaph of the
Rutland Herald, viz: "Would it not
be well to let the legis'ature look
over the ot'ier candidates a trifle?"
That's just what I am aking, and
all that 1 am asking. Under such
condition I am willing to take my
chances with the incoming legisla
ture, feeling hat my qualifications
are adequate for the position of
Sergeant-at-Arms.
I can see no just reason for my
withdrawing my candidacy because
the incumbent has selected another
man to wear his political shoes.
