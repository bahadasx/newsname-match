From Plan Voted J
A bond issue of $330,000. providing
lor the permanent Improvement of 32
miles-of road in Paw Paw district, will
be voted on by the voters of that district
on February 5. A petition asking
the county court tor permission to hold
a special election is in the Prosecuting
attorney's office and will be presented
to the court Tuesday.
In tlio petition, signed by fifty of
"the district's voters, there are a number
of changes from the petition which
, was granted and voted upon In the district
last spring. The former petition
called for a bond issue of $380,000 and !
the improving of 20 miles of road. The I
petition to bo prcsonted to the county j
court Tuesday is substantially .the
same as the first one only that it. cuts
off four miles of road with a saving of
* $80,000.
The roads which wore left out in the
present petition are: One mile on a
road above FalrvieW>one mile on Itobinson's
run, and two ipiles on upper Little
"Paw Paw. These roads arc but littie
traveled and the leaving them out
of the improvement program will work
\ little hardship to the road facilities of
) the district in the event the roads are
Improved.

!
changes that liavc been made in the
present instance, the general opinion 1
is that the bonds v.-ill lie utuhori/.ed by *
a Comfortable majority in excess of tlie 1
needed two-thirds.
Much of the opposition to the bonds '
in the last election, was based on tlie \
including in the appropriation, the cost '
ot improving the sections of road which ?
1 avo been eliminated in tlio petition to
be presented. With this hone of con- '
tentiou removed, supporters of tho
nioasuro declare a third of the opposi- '
tlon will be found In line with the!1
workers for progress. *
The Improved road, if built, will pro ( *
vide a continuous highway of brick.1'
macadam or like material, from Fair
inont to Fairvicw, and will provide in 1
the Dakota to Hlvesville section, a unit
of the road to lie built in a few years
to Morgantown. Workers for the improvements
are already at work in the
district explaining its provisions to tnv
few who are not already familiar will,
them, and arguing its practicalness.
The petition has not been granted as ]
yot by tho county court but there is 1
litle if any doubt that it will be grant
ed and that February r? will be ordered
as tho date for the holding of the elcctlon.
If the election carries and the bonds i
are authorized, they will probably be j
sold In time for the work to start with 1 |

Alien Watson the second witness
as rather impartial in his statciuf tits

tat when Shaver approached Christm*
he did so with a significant movecut
toward the right hand hip puc5t.
"as if he was going to draw a

chief of the mine rescue ear of the department

United States government, this inoru-j
lug and rendered the following verdict:
"We, ilie jury,* find from the ovi
donee that tne said L. &1. Jones. came ,
to his death on the twentieth of October,
lOlti. icom effects of suffocation I
while entering Jamison mine No. 7
while in the employ of the United >

j Evidence was brought out that Jones '
when found showed all the marks of
lone having perished from the effects i
of breathing violently of poisonous;
gases. This was told by L)r. A. \V. j
< Smith, who rendered all possible as-1
sistance when Jones was first noticed i
; in trouble in the uilne. The doctor
was in the mine with Jones.
Other witnesses stated that it was ,
likely that Jones came to his death j
through an effort, lie made to get more !
ioxygen, when he ventured into the!
denser workings. When picked up ami
brought to the surface he still had 20 ,
minutes of oxygen in his tank accord
ins to the gauge. In getting more oxy-:
gen he probably turned on n:s tank in
full, thus blowing bis mouthpiece off ;
anil before lie could again get his apparatus
placed hail inhaled too much :
j of the gas. According to the testi-.
roony. the terrific pressure from one 1
of these tanks is capable of disurrang-;
log the mouthpiece, lie was first noticed
in trouble when he was taken ill
paroxysms of roughing, quite likely,
say the witnesses, due to the gases.

By EDGAR WORTH INGTON
As the year 191?? is slowly fading
away and the new year 1817 is but ;
a spot on the horizon the taking of I
inventories and the general checking'
up and reviewing serins universal. I
The work or the local Young Men's'
Christian Association seenm well j
known to the people of the city and
yet the citizens are not fully acquaint-!
ed with the organization, having met
it. perhaps, in only one of its many 1
sides.
The year lit 16 opened with much
promise in association affairs and continued
to live up tu promise aud finishes
the year with an even aud ileal ,
thy stride. The year closes with the
largest membership in its history and
the largest membership in the stale,
which has helped to place Fairmont on ,
tli map in Y. M. ('. A. corners, ruder
the head of membership it is
found that about .10(1 worthy hoys and
young men have been taken tare of
by men and women of the city interested
ill 13oy Life ami in association.
The present executive force consisting
of .lauics \Y Kiirht. general
secretary; George W.* Lllickley. physical
work secretary, and Edgar It.
Worthing, hoys' work secretary, were
in charge for the entire year and so
?nv am*iliCtt IIHVC UCPI1 piillllK.'U tO UCvclopc
a* the year progressed.
In the Physical department I he gymnasium
has been used to a great extent
|?3 the men and boys with about
800 using the floor at different times.
Leagues were conducted in basketball.;
indoor busehail and volley ball, and
tho spirit of competition was develop-,
oil to a high degree. In the gymnasium
classes it has been found that!
an interest lias .been shown in appara-j
ins work that has never been shown ,
lit tore, ruder the charge of tin* I'hys- j
it al department conn s the howling
alleys and never before in tin- history
of the association has such interest,
been manifested in the sport of duck j
pins and ten pins and during the year;
leagues wore formed for the Venn-'
morcial men. Professional men. High school
boys and a Church league. Over j
two hundred different men have howled
in the leagues. During the fall j
season the alleys have been put in line
shape and rank with tho finest in the
state.
In i he similiter a baseball league was
run at South Side park, and tenuis
tournament was also conducted at the'
sumo place on the association's four
courts, which wore also used a great.
deal by the members. Swimming
classes were held for ladies and 101
took advantage of the opportunity offered
them, a great many boys unci !
men also were taught, in the pool.
Under tho head of Boy's Work it is
found that hji exc ellent piece of work '
ies being done tills year in connection
with the All-Ilound contest for boys, j
which emphasises the nil-round development
of the hoy. and seeks to also 1
co-operate with the c hurches, schools,
and homes. A Boys' Work institute
was also held and Mr. Charles It.
Drum brought to tile people of Fair-1
rnont a new conception of the needs |
of Boy Life. A Sunday Afternoon'
club, Bible classes. Father and Son
banquet, Social evenings, hikes and1
trips have done much to brine to the !
boys of Fairmont a realization of the;
bigness of the association program.
A summer caiup was also c onducted j
for the boys on the Cheat river.
During the year over I to men were
taken care of in the Dormitory and
nearly every one ot these were strangers
In the city. They were provided I
for and soon made to feel at home in
Fairmont. The 42 rooms have been1
in great demand all year and a great
many timer has found every room full.
Another work of the association this
year has been to place men who are
unemployed, and because of the scarcity
of laborers in this section every
man really wanting work has been
located. A Night school was conducted
the first half of the year hut with
the city Night schools organized It j
was thought needless to duplicate.!
However, the Night school for foreign j
boys will be located at the Y. M. C. A.
the first of the year. The Men's meeting
011 Sunday afternoons have been
iContlnued on Page Eight.)
