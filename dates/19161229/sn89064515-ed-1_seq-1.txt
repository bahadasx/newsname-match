TEAKETTLE BOXUNO OVER CAUS
ES ASPHYXIATION OF MAN
OF ST. PAUL
Staples World: Mrs. R. B. Sorrell
was called to St. Paul last week Tues
day by a telegram informing her of
the serious illness of her son,. J. D.
Sorrell, who died the following day.
His death was the result of a peculiar
accident or happening. His yrifQ was
away to attend the funeral of a rela
tive and Mr. Sorrell had to get his
own breakfast. He got up in the morn
ing, started the gas stove, out on the
teakettle and then lay down for a lit
tle while to wait for the water to boil.
He fell asleep, the kettle boiled over
and put out the fire. The gas filled
the room and caused the death of the
sleeper. When discovered, Mr. Sor
rell was not dead. He was taken to. a
hospital and everything possible was
done to save his life, but without
avail.
CHRISTMAS RECEIPTS AT POST
OFFICE LARGER THAN LAST
YEAR
The local postoffice did a much larg
er business, froth on. incoming and
outgoing mail during the week pre
ceding Christmas this year than last
year, the receipts for the same length
of time being $156.88 more. The .to
tal receipts were $871.16 this year, as
compared with $614.88 last year.
On account of the cold weather the
trains were delayed and but very little
mail came in during the nights. This
was to the advantage of the postoffice
clerks but the carriers were delayed
by it as they had to wait for the mail.
Only one additional clerk and carrier
were necessary to handle the big vol
ume of mail.

another river about 300 miles to a
place known as Yambuya. There they
will make their headquartera, but fram
there they will go still further and
