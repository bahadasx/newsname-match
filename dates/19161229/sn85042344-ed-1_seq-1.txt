The decision to pursue thin course
was made known after the s'ate dc

In many ounrters the official atti
tude was construed as Indicating that
secret exchanges were expected t'
follow if they did not precede the
formal nnswers of the entente nations
to the, notes of 1'resident Wilson and
the central powers. 4cciiiiN of th?

On the Teutonic side while the
reply to President Wilson Is regarded
hv the German enihns:iy as complying
"With President Wilson's suggestion In

many Is aaid to he willing to consider
other suggestions regarding methods

The views of the German govern
ment further are represented as
being as follows:
If the entente considers that guar
antees for the future are the principal
elements to be achieved and lacking
confidence In the German govern
ment, insists upon, knowing something
cf the guarantees that Germany Is
willing to give, the licrlin Kovernment
might mnke some declaration regard

willing to subscribe, leuvlng details

ference. The German government
considers that tliere Is but little to he
gained by going Into any lengthy dis
cussion of gtiuritntccH for Who future
with the present war In progress. In
this connection Germany, it Is as
serted, never has Intended thnt the
conference suggested should result
Immediately In tho establishment of

conference necessarily would be of h
preliminary nature t determine
whether It might not be possible to

VIMTA, oklu.. Dec. 2K. T. A.
Chandler, congressman-elect from tho
First Oklahoma district, today served
.laiti.-s S. Davenport, Ills opponent,
with answer In the hitter's contest.
Mr. ('handler denies nil of tho
charges made by Davenport, nnd ill
Ills answer makes many charges
iiLi.iiiist tlie eootestallt. Chandler
'charges Unit Davenport did not bring
I lie coolest in good faith, that his
charges lire without foundation of fact
or merit. Mr. Chandler sets out that
t wo of the three members or Hie stato
election board were Democrats, and
has issued a certificate of election to
1 1 1 M 1 .
While Mr. Davenport makes flag
rnnt charges of election frauds In
every county In the district. Mr.
Chandler sets out that the election
boards and election inspectors and tho
reglstiars wero all DemocratH and
members nf the same party as tho con
testant, and he denies that these men
rcsnricil to fraud against a member
of their own party in the Interest nf
Ihe opposition. Mr. Chandler con
tends I lui t thoso men, all appointees,
are under oath, and that he does not
believe them guilly as charged by
Davenport.
Says Indians Didn't Vote.
On the other hand. Mr. Chandler
contends that any ipiestlon of doubt
would have revel fed to Ihe benefit of
the contestant, and he sets out that
in many iiisiuuces In Delaware, '.ayes
and (itlawu counties hundreds of
voters of Indian blood were denied
the right to vote, und he cites that
they were uniiblo to register.
Mr. Chaniiler charges that the con
testant Is not new and was not on
November 7 qualified to hold the officii
of congresaiuuii, (il l accuses him of
exceeding the limit in campaign ex
penditures and making campaign
promises.
The charge of Mr. Chandler that
Ihe contest wus not brought by Dav
en ort in rood faith opens an pve
