HIS KCBlLfflT
OF PIER'S BULGE
Discharged Engineer Says That
.; He Sought to Save Face of
Harbor Commissioners
It wa In the belief that his admis
sion xmcerninri the bulging out of
Pier 9 wou'd ave the harbor board
from disgrace, tnat J. G. Morgan, for
mer assistant enlne?r, decided to con
fess that he ha1 falsified In the mat
ter. Morgan told the tory to the Star
liulletin today, rather f lowly and rath
er hesitatingly as he looked back over
the wita that have elapsed since he
first learned that the wail was bowed
out and resolved to keep the matter
secret even frou the toard itself.
.CHe declares that Charles R. Forbes,
chairman, and members of the board
knew nothing; about the bow in the
wall, b:it that Forbes and McCarthy
knew that It bid cracked at the cor
ner. It was at this time that the
dredglns was ordered stopped. "
Feared Design Attacked
"I see now that I was In the wrong,"
said Morgan today, "but I felt that
the wharf watf safe after Its first
bulge. I thought the design of the
wharf would b3 attacked if the fact
that tho wall was out was announced,
when as a matter of fact the wall was
never designed to allow the sort of
liydra-iiic fill that the Lord-Young
people forced Into it. ; ...,'.
"The vail went out in about three
day to the extent of five inches, but
.1 am Tonfident that it stopped as
soon as the filling ceased. If the fill
had kept on it wculd undoubtedly have
gone ntjll more.
. Declares Contractors Knew .
, Morgan declares that he and the
: contractors wer j fellow conspirators in
'the game. They; knew the wall was
oat as veil as he, though Ed Lord had
'previous' laughed when warned that
the hydraulic till would raise trouble,
he says. Morgan tells of how he him
self . juggled the flgkres so that the
carpenters might letup the top'section
of .wall !n line.'
"I wo ild find out how much the cop
per plas was off," he says, and then
Rive figures to the carpenter so the
forms would it in line. I did not
,feel that this was any great crime so
long as the wall was safe, .anyhow.
Sees Revelation Coming
.lt was not until after the meeting
. on Saturday dhen the decision was
.- made 9 have an investigation by two
engineers that I decided to tell all,'.'
says the former official. "I saw that
iv the investigation would show that the
wall bored, and that the disgrace
would then fall on the board. . I decid-
',;cd to put the blame on myself."
' Charges Playing Politics V
Morgua makvs another remarkable
statement to the effect that the mo
" on of Commissioner McCarthy to dis
charge Mm dishonorably instead of
a political move that the colonel was
playing politics. -
"Maybe I am tiased in this regard,"
Morgan adraiU, "but the first thing
McCarthy said cn the night of the ex
ecutive ession was not for the safety
of the wail but the likelihood of its
preventing appror-riations . for future
. jobs.-.
Cregsr is Exonerated ,
William Greinr, inspector, knew
nothin of the bulge in the wall, ac
cordin4 to Morgan, as it happened at
the time Greger was off the job with
"a blackened eye from the mix with
Victor ves. Morgan says that he him
self was the sole territorial representa
tive on the work then for. several
days, daring whirh time the line went
out.
' ."-He hoped to vrotect Forbes, also, by
. ronfeaiiing. Not that Forbes knew of
the bow, he says, but that he would
have jen attacked for it if the first
investigation nad been made. Forbes
expressed the belief in a letter to the
hoar! Wednesday that the action by
Morgaa was tr. save his chief" in a
Bense of mistaken loyalty.

John . K. Kekaula, Hawaiian,
charged with Having beaten and kick
ed'Llzzie Maluna to death in Palama
last Saturday night, today was bound
over to the territorial grand jury lot
lowing a preliminary hearing of the
case in Circuit Judge Ashford's court.
In the warrant for Kekaula's arrest,
issued Thursday, the defendant was
charged . with first degree murder.
The opinion of Judge Ashford, after he
had heard the testimony, was that Ke
kaula had committed the assault while
drunk, but that he probably bad no
wilful intention In injuring the woman.
The court reduced the charge from
first degree murder to first degree
manslaughter. Bond was fixed in the
sum of $1000. City Attorney A. M
Brown says the case will be presented
to the grand jury on January 5. This
Is the case where a dead woman was
brought to the police station and
locked up as a drunk. ;f. j

HOTELS PROVED-
Takes Issue With Assurances
Yesterday; Tells of Knights
Templar Troubles
An emim.itic statement that the ho
tel accommodations of Honolulu are
not sufficient for the tourists coming
here this winter Is made by James S.
McCandiess. Ilfs statement to the
Star-Bulletin this morning comes as a
result of a meeting; yesterday after
noon of the Hawaii Promotion Com
raHtee and local hotel managers. At
this meeting the hotel men said that
w hlle it is impracticable, to make res
ervations for accommodations from
January J3 to he end of the Carnival
season, tourist) l arriving here will be
able to find accommodations. With
this Mr. McCandless takes issue.
"The assurance now that there are
enough hotel accommodations is mis
leading and. according to my. experi
ence with the hotels, the statements
the hotels make now are not correct
says McCandless. "I have recently
had some personal Acquaintance with
conditions. As Honolulu knows, we
have succeeded . In securing a visit
from a large body of the Knights
Templar of San Francisco Command
ery, with the; probability that other
Knights of the coast will join this ex
cursion, which Is to arrive here Feb?
ruary 19. . . .. ,
"They have taken 100 rooms on the
Great Xorthern but I have been abso
lutely unable to provide accommoda
tions for them when they arrive Jn
February. I talked with the manage
ments of tile Territorial ; Hotel Com
pany and the Pleasahton Hotel and
over -! my signature will state that I
cculd not get -assurances of, one rooni
for that party.
"It Is not sufficient to say 'that
when the time comes they will be
taken care of. The facts are that the
hotels know they are going to. be so
full that they wilt not guarantee an?
rooms.;, .', . ..;;,
"Hotel accommodations mean oj
ought to mean accommodations that
the prospective visitor mn be sure of
Otherwise they are not Justified In
coming to Honolulu. It is not right to
try to stow away parties such as these
of the Knights - Templar anywhere
they can be hastily put the day the
steamer arrives. " .
"I am also informed on good an
Ihorlty that the Moana Hotel has had
to Inform something like 100 Inquir
ers that nothing could be guaranteed
that rooms could not be reserved
for the period they wished to come.
' As a result of my belief that there
will not be adequate accommodations
In February unless something radical
Is done,'! have taken up the proposi
tion of having the Knights Templar
stay aboard the Great Xorthern while
she Is in port. It Is absolutely wrong
for us to take a chance that there will
be rooms somewhere when ur visit
ors come." V
Repoits of Maui and Kauai tax
assessors which have just been re
ceived , by Territorial . Treasurer
Charles J. McCarthy show that both
islands will have an Increase in tax
money for the year 1917.
Maul's assessor reports that the net
increase of assessment over the last
annual period is $7,798,019, while that
for Kauai Is given as $3,541,480.
This means, taking into considera
tion such data as is available, that
Kauai will received at least $23,609.86
more than last year and Maui will re
ceive an increase of $51,986.78. This
is the minimum estimate, .the actual
figures will be more. '
Treasurer McCarthy declines as yet
to estimate the tax rate for the com
ing year, but D. L. Conkllng, county
treasurer, guesses It lower than the
present rate of 1.273;

An interesting nnd somewhat dif
ferent version of the alleged skin"
game In an opium transaction among
several Honolulu Japanese as pub
lished yesterday In the Star-Bulletin
was glvei out today by a prominent
Japanese! who Kays his story Is now
common knowledge among hfs coun
trymen. 4
The Stir-Bulletin's informer credits
the plot qf selling opium, playing po
liceman and later grabbing both the
opium and the money, to Fukaea wa.
whose reputation with the : police is
net the best. The story is that Fuka
gawa obtained 50 tins of opium, said
to be worth $2500,-from a local Chi
nese; offered Kalt&u ,1 per cent com
mission to sell it and then rushed into
Kaitsif plaf e in Kakaako December
10, when the deal was nearly closed;
frightened the prospective buyers
away and made " off : with the opium
and -the ' money.
A meeting was held in a local office
Wednesday with Kaitsu, his wife, and
the five Japanese who ; had each put
up $200 to buy the opium on a specula
tion.: It ia said that Fukagawa had
reduced his price to $2000 and . had
agreed to take $1000 down ($200
from each, of the , five). Fukagawa
was then, called into Wednesday's
meeting and accused by Mrs. Kaitsu
of being the man who frightened the
buyers. way an4, appropriated the
spoils. J Following the accusation Fu
kagawa, went, directly to the' United
S.ta tes 5 rsha tyotflce,-:, . i v . V
'The give- Japenese were slttfng in
Kaltsu's room with, $1000 in a bag
ready to pay for the opium in a box
nearby when they heard footsteps on
the porch," says the; Star-Bulletin in
former. "Suddenly the door was kick
ed in, one of the five .was knocked
over and they all dashed - from the
house. Mrs. Kaitsu was In . an ad
joining room and peeked behind the
dcor to see Fukagawa taking away
the money and the opium." .
That the case undoubtedly wilf be
presented to the federal grand jury Is
the opinion of the IT. S. attorney's of
fice. The Star-Bulletin is informea
that a hui of three Japanese had been
formed to purchase ; th opium, nnd
that the district attorney's office has
in its possession the; written state
ments of the members of the hui.
Carl B. Andrews, chief engineer of
the Oahu Rajl way & Land Company,
is the third member of the examining
board named by the harbor commis
sion to report on the condition of
Piers 8, 9 and 10. - Andrews' name was
announced following his acceptance to
day. , V-V V
Letters of instruction were today
sent out to the three engineers An
drews, George W. Armitage and G. H.
Gere requesting them to begin the in
vestigation as soon as possible, i-
In brief the committee of engineers
is instructed to examine bulkhead
walls of Piers 8 and 9 as to their
safety and stability, report on ; the

tecommendations as they deem advis
able, examine Pier 10 plans and .speci
fications,' making such recommenda
tions or changes as they see fit, sub
mitting estimates of costs of construc

The letter outlines the motion made
by Commissioner James Wakefield on
Wednesday afternoon when the vote
to name such a board was up for con

DISPOSITION OF LITTLE
GIRL IS PUZZLING COURT
Wnether the father cr mother shall
have custody of Iheir edopted child s
the rather delicate question jhat Ju
venile Tudge Whitney will have to
decide tomorrow morning.
The mother, who Is. part-Hawaiian,
is livlaj In Watkiki with the three-year-ol-1
girl who. thinks Probation
Officer Joseph -Leal, is American. The
father i3 said to be a Hindu and, from
what th-j juveulle court officers have
learned, 'he little gill was adopted on
the mainland oOme time ago.
A separation of . the. father and
mother is said to have been the next
step in the case and the father re
cently sr rived n ere and has demanded
the custody of the child. The mother
also deJianda her'custody. So Judge
Whitney will have to decide In whose
care ihe youngster shall be placed.

ROBS YITH
A' barefooted burglar with -an at
tentive pet dog Is becoming so bold
In Waikiki that one home there'wraa
entered at dinner time last night and
another entered in the early evening
when residents were in the immediate
vicinity of the place. Chief McLuffie
has good suspicions of whom the man
may be and has detailed two men to
closely watch the district: visited.
When Mr. and Mrs. Fred G. Kirchhoff
left their cottage to go to dinner last
night they took extra precautions to
lock their doors. When' they re
turned a half liour later some one
had evidently entered the front door
with a pass key, as it was open, and
had hurriedly ransacked the house,
apparently in search of moneyleaving
by the rear doer after stealing little
more than a revolver.; There wer?
bare footsteps all-around the house,
accompanied by the tracks of a dog,
which could be traced down the beach.
A short time later, evidently the
same man entered the cottage 'of Mr.
and ;rs. John Vickers, for he again
made off with a pistol. A few nights
ago an adjacent cottage of Mr. and
Mrs. Clark was entered while they
were away and it is thought it was
reentered after they had returned and
had gone to bed. Another resident in
that vicinity recently lost $10 In coin
from her home and two or three other
cottages have been entered In the last
few .weeks.
Honolulu's marriage license bureau
is being overrun of late with youths
and maidens who have not yet reached
the age prescribed by law- when they
may of their own will take up the re
sronsibilities of married life.
This is the declaration of Palmer
Woods, marriage license agent, who
says that never before in the history
of the olfice hae so many youngsters
applied for licenses. - : v
"We I'sually have about one case a
month,'' said Woods today, "but the
December showing is already seven or
eight. I don't know what to think of
it or liow to n ime the cause of the
sudden increastv but It Is a fact nev
ertheless. We are always vigilant in
this matter and investigate thoroughly.
