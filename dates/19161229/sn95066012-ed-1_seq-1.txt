French Line on the Western Front
Haa Been Shortened and British
S Line Lengthened.
London, Dec. 29. The continuation
of the British offensive along the
Somme front la impossible so long aB
the present weather lasts, so Maj-Gen
Frederick B. Maurice, chief director
of military operations at the British
war office so Informed the Associat
ed Press yesterday. "I told you
some time ago," he said, "that our
offensive would not cease during the
winter, but it must be apparent from
the dally reports that no real battle
has been offered in that sector since
October. In the first place we un
derestimated the effect of the shelling
on the terrain.
' "The country over which the ad
vance will have to be made is thickly
sprinkled with shell holes filled with
water. Also, never having held the
same line in any other winter, we
underestimated the effect of the fog
in the valley of the Somme. There
have been frequent frosts, not severe
enough to harden the ground, but
sufficient to form fogs, making artil
lery observation fire practically use
less and also preventing the drying
of the ground.
"The French arrived at the same
decision and transferred their atten
tion to Verdun, with results which
you know. , We may be able to re
sume in March, as we found the
ground at Neuve Chapelle in fairly
good shape in March, 1915, although
It had een very bad during the win
ter. Unable to continue the offensive
for the present, we have done the
next best thing. : The taking over of a
section of the French line has kept
Ms busy during the past 10 days. The
operation has been successful and I
will be glad to tell you the exact ex
tent of the line taken over when I am
sure the Germans know the point of
Junction.
"In Rumania the 1st Rumanian
army, which has borne the brunt of
the fighting, has been entirely with
drawn and is now reforming in Mol
davia, while Its place has been taken
by the Russians. In Dobrudja the
line has been moved back in align
ment with the battle front north of
the Danube. In this region both our
allies and the enemy are ' suffering
from adverse weather conditions."

CONFERENCE 111
DEADLOCK
Demand Paise While Waiting for
Court Ruling
Railroad Managers Refuse to Grant
Raise Until Court Has Passed ..
on the Law.
New York, Dec. 29. The much
heralder conference between the Na
tional Conference Committee of Rail
ways and the heads of the four big
brotherhoods ended in a deadlock
yesterday. The employes insisted that
the increase in their pay under the
Adamson eight-hour law should be
given to them from Jan. 1 until such
a time as the Supreme Court should
pass under the law's constitutionality,
and regardless of what that decision j
might be. The railway heals insisted
with equal firmness that no increase
should be paid until the court had I
acted, although they agreed that If the
law were upheld, the increase should
be retroactive. I
The amount of money at stake Is
$5,000,000 a month. The conference
was held at the Grand Central termi
nal and lasted an hour and a half. Af
ter the disagreement other conferen
ces which were to have been held this
week and next, looking to a setlement
of problems Incident to the applica
tion of the Adamson law, were de
clared off.
The brotherhood leaders In opeuing
the conference, declared that any set
tlement must be prefaced by an agreei
ment by the railroads that the Adam
son eight hour law go Into effect Jan.
1, regardless of the suits pending
against It. The railroad representa
tives replied that they had made an
agreement with the Attorney General
by which the operation of the law
was suspended until the Supreme
Court handed down its decision as to
the act's validity. The brotherhood
heads furthermore specified that the
law must be constructed as they in
terpreted It. When the union chiefs
met the adamant refusal of the rail
road managers they said they were
through negoglating and walked from
the room, two of them going down
stairs and purchasing tickets for their
homes.
ONLY 360 CHILDREN AT WORK
Inspector Reports 27,314 Males and
5,549 Females In Plants.
Montpeller, Dec. 2C The biennial
report of the state factory inspector
Allan Calhoun of Middlebury, just
made public, says that there are only
3G0 minors under 16, employed in the
different Industries of the state. The
report says that 27,314 males and
5,549 females are employed In Ver
mont's Industries.
Much attention has been given says
the inspector, to the proper safe
guarding of machinery, but it has
been found that many employees re
move the safety devices which the
employers have furnished. He sug
gests that each shop should have a
safety committee of employees, say
ing:
"It has como to be realized that the
pievention of industrial accidents de
pends largely upon the care exercis
ed by the employees as a whole and
that is why every meclianlc.il estab
lishment should have Its safety com
mittee." The inspector declares that he has
found a pronounced Improvement In
the sanitary conditions In factories
throughout the state, but makes a
suggestion for more stringent sani
tary laws. He urges that the re
quirements for fire escapes be the
same for Industrial plants as for the
schools, theaers, and public halls; he
wants elevator guards required by
law and would require that all doors
open outward.
Another piece of legislation recom
mended is that proper machinery be
installed in the granite and stone In
dustries to remove as far as possible
the dust nuisance, as a measure pro
tecting the workmen from disease and
consumptive trouble.
SUPPORT FROM NORWAY
Laor Party Sends Message to
President Wilson.
The Norwegian labor party, says a
Reuter dispatch from Christianla, has
sent President Wilson the following
message: "The Norwegian social
democracy, numbering a third part of
the Norwegian electors, expresses
sympathy with President Wilson's en
ergetic labor for the conclusion of tho
war of barbarity and the establish
ment of a lasting peace."
The Norwegian peace union has re
solved to send the Norwegian govern
ment a declaration urging the govern
ment to support every wellfounded
effort to attain a lasting peace based
on respect for International rights
and the Independence of nations.

and
BRITISH EXTEND THEIR LINE
, Have Taken Over the Defence of
Another Section of the Front In
France.
Berlin, Dec. 29. This morning's re
port from the Carpathian front states
that 1400 more Russians and Ruman
ian prisoners have been brought In.
In Dobrudja tho Bulgarians have cap
tured the village of Rachel.
Along the Carpathian front the
Russians have failed to gain in spite
of the sacrifice they have made and
there has been a slackening of their
attack.
The Russian losses here are said to
have been the bloodest of the whole
war. In their effort to divert the Ger
man advance in Rumania the Rus
sians sent their new and ouly partly
trained army against the veteran Aus
trian and German lines on tho Car
pathian front. Whole divisions were
wiped out.
The latest ofTlcial communica
tion from Berlin records fresh ad
vances for the Teutonic allies against
the Russians and Rumanians in Walla
chia. The Invaders are now well be
yond RIninik Sarat, advancing along
the railway toward Fokshanl. Three
thousand more prisoners and 22 ma
chine guns have been captured by the
invaders, bringing the number of men
taken in the RImnik-Sarat maneuver
up to 10,220.
Although the Berlin war offllce re
ports that the Teutonic allies in Do
brudja are keeping up their pressure
against the Russians and Rumanians
and have driven the Russians from
fortified high positions east of Mat
chin, on the east bank of the Danube
opposite Braila. Petrogrod announces
that the invaders south of the Danube
have been repulsed with heavy Iorscs,
except at the village of Rakel. which
has been occupied by them. British
armed motor cars, says Petrograd,
did great execution in this fighting.
Considerable fighting has again
taken place on the Verdun sector
around Le Mort Homme, and on the
eastern slopes of hill 304, where the
Germans made an attack but were re
pulsed, and where later the French
began a bombardment of the German
positions.
Unofficial advices received in Lon
don from Salonica says the Greeks
who surrendered to the Bulgarians at
Kavala have been ordered by King
Constantino to proceed to the Mace
donian front to fight against the en
tente allies.
From Athens comes an unofficial
dispatch announcing that Greece is
addressing another note to the enten
te declaring that unless there is a
change In tho entente blockade,
Greece may be forced to seek the
advice of the nation concerning the
course to be followed.

PREPARATIONS FOR NO-LICENSE
Meeting for Men and One for Women
to Be Held Sunday.
North Adams, Dec. 29. rians for
the enforcement of the liquor laws un
der no-license are already taking form
and an organization that will cover
practically every section of the city
Is being perfected. The first step
will be the holding of two community
services Sunday night. One service
for men will be held In the Congrega
tional church and Rev. T. K. Bus
field, the pastor, will preside. The
speakers will Include Rev. J. F. Bis
grove of the Methodist church, Rev.
M. E. Mott of St. John's Episcopal
church and Rev. G. M. Gerrish of the
Universalist church. At the meeting
for women which Is to be held in the
First Baptist church, Mrs. Katherine
H. Millard will preside and the ad-i
dress of the evening will be by Rev. '
J. Foster Wilcox, the pastor, on "Lo,
these 30 years." It Is expected that
at tho men's meeting those present
will be asked to enrcll their names ns
men favoring law enforcement and
tho women will be asked to take
blanks and have them filled out and
signed by men of their acquaintance
who aro willing to assist in the en
forcement of the liquor law.
It is expected that a formal scheme
of organization and operation will be
developed from these meetings and
that by the time t he no-license regime '
comes Into being. May 1. there will
ho a strong and well-equipped society
that will spare neither effort nor ex
pense, according to those back of the
plan. In seeing the law vigorously and
sirickly enforced, it became current
yesterday that eu effort would be
made to have the. neighboring town of
Clarksburg go for license at the com
ing town-mejfting. There has never (
been a licensrcf saloon In that town
and it Is certain that any attempt to
have th place go to the "wet" col-
unine will meet with vigorous opposi
tion. The place is so small that but
one saloon could be licensed there in
any event.

earlier than usual for the Christmas
vacation and all Christmas exercises
In the schcols and churches were
abandoned.

KOT STATED
Germans Want Their Wonies
Bsck From the Allies
RESTITUTION BY BOTH SIDES
Will Yield Their Holdings If the A I-
Ilea Will Give Up What They
Have Captured.
Washington, Dec. 28. Coincident
with the receipt here today of tho offi
cial responses of Germany and Aus
tria to President Wilson's peace note
of Dec. 18, an outline was obtained of
the basic principles upon which the
Central Powers would be willing to
negotiate for an ending of the war.
it cannot be asserted that this outline
Is officiui, but it comes from the best
sources of authoritative information,
and no doubt Is felt that It correctly
represents the position of Germany
and her allies.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
Ambassador, is credited with having
received from Berlin detailod instruc
tions to guide him in representing his
government in every phase of efforts
toward peace which may in any way
involve his intercourse with the Wil
son Administration. One intimation
heard today was that these instruc
tions had been brought to this coun
try by the German merchant subma
rine Deutschland on her last trip
when she made port at New London,
Conn., and was visited there by the
German envoy.
What stands out In tho understand
ing obtained of Germany s position
with regard to peace negotiations is
that the Central Powers will not con
sent to turn over the Caroline Islands
and other German colonies now in the
possession of their enemies as com
pensation for Injury done to Belgium
and other territory invaded by the
German forces.
The Uetn.an position Is that if Bel
glum was made to suffer unjustly
through the German invasion, Ger
many also has an account to settle
with her enemies because of the de
vastation done in Lost Prussia, while
Austria feels that under the same con
ditions she Is entitled to some consid
eration because of the havoc wrought
In Gallcia and in parts of Transylvan
ia. The Central Powers, It is con
tended can hardly the expected to give
up Belgium or other enemy territory
occupied by tho forces of the Central
Powers unless under an arrangement
by which German territory held by
the Entente is restored to the German
Government. It Is realized here
that in view of what was said by Mr.
Lloyd George in his speech of Dec. 19, i
insistence by the Central Pow ers up- j
on such a condition might bring the
effort to initiate peace proceedings to
a sudden end.
In quarters, where the position of
the Central Powers is known, and
where predictions as to the course of
action this group will pursue in cer
tain clrcumtances are usually verl- .
fled, it was asserted today that the j
German response to President Wil
son's note of Dec. 18 was not an evas- i
ion of what wus called" for by the
President, but an acceptance in prin
ciple of all that the President sug
gested. In suggesting that tho first
move toward peace should be the as
sembling of delegates of loth groups
of belligerents in some neutral place
Germany, it was said, was following
historical precedent.
The nming of peace had always
been the outcome of a preliminary
conference of the belligerents and no
other method of preeedure was known
It was said. Tho assertion was made
that In his recent note to the belliger
ents President Wilson did not ask the
Central Powers for their peace terms,
but merely asked that they suggest a
method of arranging for an exchange
of Ideas and a sounding of views. I
Germany, It was contended, had
answered the President by proposing
that delegates from tho two groups
of belligerents be assembled to dis
cuss tho matters suggested by the
President.

OF THE WELFARE
ASSOCIATION
Annual Cotillion Was Attended
ty 75 Couples
AFFAIR WAS A GtflT SUCCESS
Special Feature Was Christmas Tree
With Favora For All Thoae
Present.
About seventy-five couDles were
present at the annual cotillion given
Thursday evening by the Welfare As
sociation in Foresters hall. Every
thing tended to make the affair a
splendid success from the beginning
to the end and the perfect harmony
of arrangements and the delightful
results produced showed the care and
diligence of those in charge. There
was a reception at 8.30, the commit
tee being Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Holden,
Mr .and Mrs. George M. Hawks and
Mrs. C. W. Thatcher. At nine o clock
all present assembled for the grand
march, which was led by Mr. and Mrs.
Holden.
The hall which has been trimmed In
almost every possible scheme, pre
sented an out of the ordinary and
most attractive appearance, dark red
and green being the predominating
colors. Great ropes of green, dotted
with polnsettas, were stretched from
the corners of tho main hall to tho
center, from which there hung a large
red bell; massive wreaths of holly,
with poinsetta blossoms adding the
necessary touch of color, were hung
on the wall, as well as branches of
evergreen. In the tmall lounging
room, where punch was served, small
Christmas trees were placed in the
corners and the same general scheme
was followed as iu the large hall.
The gowns were unusually gay and
pretty, the bright colors being toned
down but very little by an occasional
touch of black. White, pLnk, blue and
yellow were the most popular shades,
with the fashionable net oversklrt and
trimming of fur making a most at
tractive se.Uiag. The . music, which
was furnished by Donnelly's orches
tra, augmented by banjos, which lent
an unusual swing to It, was excellent.
The musicians were ensconced be
hind Christmas trees and seated on a
balcony.
Just before the Intermission, the
light3 were dimmed and a large
Christmas tree was placed under the
bell In the center of the hall, and 11
luminated with numerous lights of all
colors. In the subdued light, the
dancers formed a circle around the
treo and danced a kaleidoscope, mak
ing a fantastic and quaint scene. Af
terwards each person present re
ceived a favor, which was suspended
from the branches.
Among those from out of town were
Miss Anna Powers of Cambridge,
MIsb Lido. Bassett of Plymouth,
Mass., Charles Isbell of North Adams,
Miss Ruth Stevens of North Hooslck
and IGrand Babcock of Hooslck.
The committee In charge wish to
express their appreciation to those
who so generously gave their services
towards making the affair a success,
among them being the Camp Fire
girls, who made the polnsettas and
filled the favors, which were fur
nished by Mrs. Georgo M. Hawks.
Harry Scuthall, who superintended
the decorating, C. R. Mann and the
"Y" boys who brought in the ever
green trees and branches and all oth
ers who contributed .their help.
The general committee of which
Mrs. G. M. Hawks was chairman, was
composed of Mrs. George F. Graves,
Mrs. Edward W. Bradford, Mrs. Rob
ert E. Healy. Mrs. C. W. Thatcher,
Miss Hilda Pratt. Philip T II. Pierson
