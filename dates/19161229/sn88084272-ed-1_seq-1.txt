Latest accounts placed the left of
field marshal von Mackensen's line
beyond Rlmnlk-Sarat. while his
right is apparently drawing close
to Braila, at the Danube end of the
trunk line from Buzeu.
Braila. important as a provision
ing depot, itself is meanwhile re
ported under fire from across the
Danube, where the Bulgarians, with
German and Turkish assistance, are
vigorously assaulting the Matchin
bridgehead. The apparent hope is
to clear Dobrudja completely of
Russians and effect a permanent
junction with the Teutonic forces
in Wallacfala at the Danube.

The latest peace move has been
