OFFICIAL TEXT OF
ANSWER ARRIVES
Washington, D. C., Dec. 28. —Ger
many, it was made known here today,
will not permit the road to peace nego
tiations to be blocked by a refusal of
the entente belligerents to enter a con
ference without prior knowledge' of
her terms. It has been forecast that
the entente powers would base a re
fusal on such a condition.
The central powers are represented
as willing to permit a confidential ex
change of broad tentative terms
through President Wilson should it be
come necessary to do so to bridge the
gap which threatens to prevent a gath
ering of peace delegates. There were
broad intimations today that a state
ment of this position by Germany
either had been communicated to the
United States government or soon
would be.
The official text of Germany's reply
to President Wilson's note arrived to
day and it was declared that no con
fidential communication from Ambas
sador Gerard accompanied it.. There
are indications however, that a con
fidential statement of Germany's posi
tion, if made, would come through the
ambassador. It has been announced In
advance however, that it would not be
made public and it is likely that its re
ceipt even would not be admitted.
Looking To Wilson.
Germany, it was said today, is look
ing to the United States to make every
effort to bring about a peace confer
ence and to that end is ready to con
sider any suggestions from the presi
dent. As the case stands now, the
German government considers it has
met all the suggestions in the presi
dent's note, and a statement to that
Effect has been made by Count von
BernstorfT. the German ambassador.
Germany, it is stated authoritatively
never has believed that, acting alone,
she would be able to bring about a con
ference and now that the influence of
neutrals has been brought to bear for
one, the German officials have taken
their view a step further and believe
they cannot be successful without as
sistance of the United States. They
believe that the United States, in
Tiev of its vital interest in the settle
ment of the war, would not be adverse
to participating, because it has been
represented as desiring most of all to
see the peace terms make provision
for the future security of the world.
Without participation by the United
States in that phase it is felt the re
sults would be without effect.
Terms Known To Gerard?
There were intimations today that
Germany's posit'on on all these points
had been conveyed by Foreign Minis
ter Zimmerman to Ambassador Gerard
at their recent conference probably in
the highest confidence for the inform
ation of President Wilson. The view
expressed in German circles here is
that the Teutonic terms when laid be
fore the entente delegates will be such
as to admit of their acceptance.
OFFICIAL TEXT ARRIVES.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 28.—The of
ficial text of Germany's reply to Pres
ident Wilson's peace note was receiv
ed here early today. So far as was
known. It was unaccompanied by any
communication and was said to be
substantially the same as the unofficial
text received Tuesday from Berlin.
The official text, which differs some

"The imperial government has ac

spirit which is apparent in the com

initiative of the president looking to
the creation of basis for the founda

"The president discloses the aim
which lies next to his heart and leaves
the choicest way open.
"A direct exchange of views appears
to the imperial government as the
most suitable Way of arriving at the
desired result. The imperial govern

Paris, Dec. 28.—The morning news

a polite refusal to comply with his sug
gestions.

In the Figaro Alfred Capus says:
"Germany in her answer to Presi

egates at a neutral city. That city, if
it was specified, would remain forever
famous as the scene of the greatest
trap in history. France, not to speak
of our allies, would come out the vas
sal of her adversaries of today, and so
many prodigious sacrifices, so much
glory won in marvelous battles would
have only served to make of us a sub
ject and a fallen people."
German Comment
Berlin, Dec. 27, via London, Dec. 28.
—Germany's answer to President Wil
son and the promptness with which it
was made have caused a good impres
sion generally in the press. Only the
anti-American newspapers show a
tendency to dissent and express the
view that interference of any kind by
America is intolerable.
Count von Reventlow, while avoid
ing a direct attack on the German
answer assumes that no German dele
gate will be found willing to take a
seat at the same table with English
and French delegates aftpr the recent
speeches of Premiers Lloyd George
and Briand or until those speeches are
apologized for.
The Taegliche Rundschau says that
the note emphatically rejects the par
ticipation of neutrals in a peace con
ference which, it thinks, would unduly
prolong negotiations beside disturbing
the natural determining forces. It be
lieves that the German people will ap
prove the proposal in the German note
that the question of a league to en
force peace be postponed until after a
settlement of the present war. It
reasons that by pursuing such a course
the problem of permanent world peace
can be dealt with by an assembly in
which all the nations of the world can
take a share.
The disposition of certain pan-Ger
man newspapers to read an unfavor
able interpretation into the Austrian
and German replies to President Wil
son's note is not shared in official
circles where the interpretation gen
erally voiced is that the reply is in
principle "a loyal acceptance of Presi
dent Wilson's suggestion promoting
the prospects of peace now and in the
future an effort in the same direction
as the original peace proposal of the
central powers."
As to the prospect that peace will re
sult directly from the present negotia
tions and interchange of notes there
is no marked display of optimism in
either official or unofficial circles.
It is said that if the proposal was ac
cepted Switzerland was the most prob
able place for the meeting because of
its central position, telegraphic facili-
sense of its declaration of the twelfth ties, adequate hotel accommodations,
instant which offered the hand for
peace negotiations, to propose speedy
assembly on neutral ground, of dele
gates of the warring states.
"It is also the view of the imperial
government that the great work for
the prevention of future wars can first
be taken up only after the ending of
the present conflict of exhaustion. The
Imperial government is ready when
this point has been reached, to coop
erate with the United States at this
sublime task."
REPLY TO SWISS NOTE.
Berlin, Dec. 27, via London, Dec. 28.

er Teutonic army is fast closing in up
on Braila. Rumania's oil and grain cen
ter on the Danube.
The Austro-German forces defeated
the Russians on a front of ten miles
southwest of Rimnik-Sarat, according
to the Berlin war office. Petrograd
admitted the Russians and Rumanians
were forced to fall back north of Me
gura but says elsewhere the invaders
were defeated with heavy casualties.
Since December 22, Berlin says,
more than 8,900 prisoners and twenty
seven machine guns have been cap
tured in Rumania.
Battles at several points along the
line in Russia and Galicia are in prog
ress from Volhynia to the Carpathians
but no important results have been an
nounced by either side.
On the other battle fronts artillery
fighting is the chief activity.

Berlin, Dec. 27, via London, Dec. 28,
—The administration papers in Buda
pest deny a renort published in the
opposition organs that Count Stephen
Tisza, the Hungarian premier, is about
to follow Baron Burian and Dr. von
Koeber into retirement. The possibil
ity of the withdrawal from public life
of Hungary's "strong man," has how

death of Emperor Francis Joseph.

HOLLAND NEWSPAPERS AND
LABOR ORGANIZATIONS MAKE
PLEA FOR PEACE.
The Hague, Dec. 27. via London, Dec.
28.—A flood of cablegrams is being
sent to President Wilson by trade
unions, social welfare societies, relig
ious bodies of all denominations and
other organizations wishing him suc
cess in what they regard as his effort
to bring about peace. The Dutch
socialist party sent the following mes
sage to the president today:
"The Dutch socialist party supports
in the strongest way your initiative
in favor of peace and appeals to the
belligerent powers to accept your pro
posal."
The newspapers, in voluminous arti
cles, regard the situation rather hope
fully with the exception of the anti
German Telegraaf which favors a war
to a finish and sneers at Germany's
answer using the words "If it can be
called an answer."
The ^Telegraaf says that the central
powers are grateful to President Wil
son which "is comprehensible inas
much as their idea of a durable peace
is to arrange things so as to avoid hav
ing to give up the territory they have
grasped."
Voice Cannot Be Stilled.
The general feeling is perhaps best
expressed by the pacifist Nenws
vaodegag, which says:
"No one will be under any illusion

gates at The Hague or elsewhere to

rcniains
that this mountain of talk will
bring forth more than a mouse and
that from now on the voice of peace
will never more be stilled.''
The paper speculates as to whether
the British imperial conference may
possibly purposely have been called
for the end of February because the
entente will then have their terms
ready.
The Calvtnist organ, Nederlander,
calls attention to what it terms the

Germany's reply to President Wil
son as compared with previous Ger
man notes to America. This change,
the Nederlander says, gives the im
pression that Germany not only sin
cerely desires peace but also wishes
to avoid giving offense to America.
The Roman Catholic Tijd understands
from a diplomatic source that diplo
matic and parliamentary circles at The
Hague are fairly optimistic regarding
peace prospects. TTiere is talk of pre
liminary non-official meetings of dele
gates at The Hague, but the Tijd says
that the wish in this case isprobably
father to the thought, although Hol
land, owing to her geographic posi
tion, is doubtless best situated for pre

ATTACK EXPLAINED
Germans State That Sinking of Neu

Was Justifiable.
Berlin, Dec. 27, via London, Dec. 28.
—The reply of the German govern
ment to another of the American in
quiries in regard to steamships sunk
by submarines, in this Instance relat
ing to the destruction of the Norweg
ian steamship Delto, with Americans
in the crew, declares that the steam
ship was chartered for transport pur
poses to a belligerent government and
hence its destruction was legitimate.
This reply, which has been delivered
to the American embassy, says that so
far as was possible the safety of the
crew was provided for. The men were
given half an hour in which to enter
the boats. The weather was clear and
the distance to the shore was not ex
cessive.
The settlement of the Marina case,
which hinges on the question whether
the steamship was a government trans
port, is being delayed pending receipt
of further advices from Washington.
MUST SHOW CAUSE
Railroads Called Upon To Explain Car
Shortage In Manner That Will
Satisfy The Public.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 28.—Repre
sentatives of railroads throughout the
country today appeared before the in
terstate commerce commission to
show cause why the commission
should not take into its own hands the
car shortage situation heretofore dealt
with by the roads themselves and
issue drastic orders to relieve conges
tion.
The order which the commission ap
parently is prepared to issue unless
the roads show cause why it should
not, would require the roads to return
to conecting lines all foreign cars on
their tracks after unloading.
George Hodges, secretary of the car
service committee created by the
American Railway association, was the
first witness and said that it had been
agreed that the committee should
have all the authority of the railroad
executives over car distribution. The
Grand Trunk, he said, had refused to
be bound by the rules which had im
posed an increase in the per diem rate
for rental.

Noted Authority on Finance,
Business and Industry
Will Give Lecture*
The next open meeting arranged by
the entertainment committee of the
Commercial club will bring to Ottum
wa one of the best known authorities
on business, industrial and financial
matters in the country and the date of
the meeting is Saturday, January 6,
1917. This will be the third gathering
arranged by the committee and prom
ises to be a treat as the speaker is
Roger W. Babson of Boston.
Mr. Babson bears the same relation
to the financial world as Thomas A.
Edison bears to the electrical world.
When Mr. Babson began his work, the
business and investment interests of
this country were unorganized and
were working along the same antiquat
ed lines as did their fathers a genera
tion before.
Mr. Babson's first work was to pro
vide a fair and correct quotation sys
tem for the forty odd thousand unlisted
stock and bond issues. When he began
this work it was laughed at as impos
sible. Today the system is in universal
operation. By this work it is said that
Mr. Babson is saving the investors of
our country from J30,000,000 to $50,000,- I
000 per year.
For years there has been financial
manuals issued once a year. Although
the insiders have always had up-to
date information, the general public
were dependent upon these annual year
books and certain financial papers, Mr.
Babson organized a mammoth card
system revised daily and installed it in
all the leading banking and brokerage
houses. Today by referring* to these
cards at any banking house the hum
blest investor can get the very latest
and most reliable information for the
asking.
Everyone is acquainted with Mr.
Babson's writings. He has made popu
lar economic and financial teachings
that were previously understood only
by the very few. Coupled with his
keenness and ferfrlessness, he has a
human touch which enables him to
understand and appeal to the man in
the street. To this is added the great
experiences which have come from ex
tensive travel all over the world and
meeting with the great leaders of all
nations.
But the greatest work of all is that
in which Mr. Babson Is now engaged
and it is in connection with this that he
comes to Ottumwa. He has discovered
tliat gir Isaac Newtoji's great law "All
Action is Followed by Equal Reaction"
applies to price trade and general in
dustrial eondtions. Through this dis
covery his great organization is now
helping the most prominent bankers,
manufacturers and merchants and in
vestors to prepare for future changes.
As to the business outlook for 1917 Mr.
Babson is expected to tell us something
while In the city.
The subject of his address is to be
the "Real Causes of Business Prosper
ity and Depression." He has been asked
to applv it especially to this city. It is
rumored that his diagnosis of the situ
ation will be a surprise to many. "Peo
ple think," writes Mr. Babson, "That
your buildings and banks will deter
mine the future of Ottumwa, but statis
tics don't teach this. Statistics teach
that the industrial and commercial fu
ture of St. Louis depends on the health,
the faith and the spirit of the people."
RELINQUISH HOPE
FOR MISSING SHIP

probably lost today. Search for the
vessel and her crew by the coast guard

less calls of distress were suddenly
silenced Christmas night, was aban
doned without having developed any
trace of either. Flotsam found by the
cutters could not be identified as being

ty of the steamer's thirty odd men lies
in the possibility that they were pick
ed from the ship's boats by a passing
steamer.
BOY IS KILLED IN
COASTING SMASHUP
Des Moines. Dec. 28.—One boy is
dead, two are in a local hospital seri
ously injured and four others suffered
minor injuries as the result of a coast
ing accident which occurred late last

boy, was instantly killed when the two
sleds bearing the coasting parties col

Physicians said today that although
the condition of the injured was criti

FOR WITHDRAWAL.

General Carranza's answer to the
request that he either sign or re
pudiate the pending protocol
which will be delivered late today
to Secretary Lane by Luis Cab
rera, chairman of the Mexican
commissioners, is understood to
contain suggestions or modifica
tions which have been carefully
worded to avoid ending the nego
tiations. No intimation was ob
tainable as to its terms.
Washington. D. C., Dec. 28.—Lois
Cabrera, chairman of the Mexican
commission, arrived here from New
York this morning bearing the answer
of Carranza to the demand of the
American representatives that he rat
ify or repudiate the protocol signed at
Atlantic City. He made telegraphic
arrangements last night with Secre
tary Lane to submit the answer today.
The character of Carranza's reply has
not been revealed but it was generally
believed it was another suggestion for
modifications and contained the in
sistence that the American troops in
Mexico be withdrawn unconditionally.
It has been understood here for sev
eral days that if General Carranza did
not return such an answer as would
warrant a reassembling of the Joint
commission, the negotiations would be
declared ended and that General Car
ranza's ambassador, Eliseo Arredondo
