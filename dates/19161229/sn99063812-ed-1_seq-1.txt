KLAMATH FALLS OREGON, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 2t, 11.
n I iu.iuji
I that Ik to buy the paiaenger terminal
J by ttopular aubacriptlon, and turn tbt-m
over to Robert K. Btrahorn.
"The Idea that the city aboutd have
bonded ltelf to buy tbeaa terminals In
addition to building tka rail line la very
ximrt aighted. ami will not appeal to
anv taxpayer after he once under-
Miindh It. When the city authorized an
lru of 9300.000 bond for rallrond
Pttrpoiie. it Incurred an Intercut obll
gallon of perbapn 118,000 per annum.
If the city had bonded Itself for 175.000
u.ore and lncted that amount In mil-
renil t.-rmlnat. It would have Increased
II (tiierevt obligation by tl.500, and
would hc withdrawn all this vhIii
ble property absolutely from taxation,
fri ihe city property 1 not taxable for
clt) obligation. On the contrary, the
city toeeeitcd upon the only business
like plan. It will Invest Its 3W.0v0 In
t. man: line raltrrad that will connc't
the heart of the e'Ay of Klamath Falls
with the town of Jlonanza and lonnctt
llrectly with Klamath, Po. Von-u.

cr alleys.
T't man or woman who cannot
M'tuie the utupenuoua algnilcanre "f
f"!i a pro'iH-i to the people of this
city ind (ojnty must be dull Indeed.
'Ihe terminal l I bought whlca now
htittx Utile lexi.uc to the city, yhen
tr the pihate i.vfucrshlp of Ilobin V.
Htrabqin. will lie taxable at ikeir ;m
prued value, for Mr. Strahorn will
proceed to spend a large sum of money
In building terminal buildings, yards,
appliances, etc., which are necessarily
very costly, and all this property, with
other Improvements Mr. Strahorn will
build, such as the line to Sblpplngton,
wilt make a very large and altogether
new body of taxable property, bringing
enough new revenue to this city to pay
tbe Interest on the $300,000 bond Issue,
a thing that would not be possible had
the city bonded Itself to buy these ter
minal and was obliged to own and
hold them, and thereby exempt them
I mm taxation.
'As it Is, If our people respond
iroinptly and loyally in carrying out
their promise to buy the passenger
ternilnuN and If tbe mayor and council
net promptly en January 15th, this city
ill i,priiig li an Incredibly short time
lo be the second city In Oregon in pop
ulation, In business and In Influence.
"Far from being a mistake not to In
clude the cost of terminals In tbe city
bond issue, It would have been an in
excusable blunder to have done so, as
It would have withdrawn a very large
body, of taxable property from taxa
tionIt would have Increased our In
terest burden Instead of providing new
revenues to take caro of all Interest on
the new bond Issue, and laatly, Mr.
Strahorn could not have spent a sum
which in the end must equal or exceed
our total Issue of railroad bonds, to
lulld costly terminals on ground that
did not belong to him. and over which
he could have no control.
"Certainly, tho city could not possi
bly stand the burden of buying this ter
minal site and In addition go to tho ex
pense of from two to three hundred
thousand dollars addlUonal to make
tho necessary Improvements to roako It
a lallrtwd terminal. 8uch a proposal
would never have met with favor by
i.ur ueonle. because It would bo clearly
hej nnd our means nnd would also hawt
been n blunder to sink all tnni money
in n inllroad and a railroad terminal
and at the same'tlmo Increase our tax
burden by exempting all thai property
from taxation."

Deep Snow Makes Good
Jack Rabbit Hunting
The fall of tbe deep snow has
brought another delight to the hunter,
the sport of Jackrabblt killing. The
deep snow makes it impossible for tbe
Jackrabblt to travel at his usual rate or
speed, and his food supply being great
ly eliminated, he has to depend upon
the farmers of hi Iclnity, to a greater
extent, for food and warm shelter.
Many hunters novo left for the jack
rabblt districts, and many are prepai
Ini; to leac Sunday to Indulge In this
sport. Along the Keno road, through
the Plevna nnd Orindale districts, the
mbblts are to bo found In large num
bers. They can bo easily seen In the
snow and their hiding in tho common
sage brush is to no avail. Also, tbe
ronu.v haystacks of'tho farmers offer n
warm shelter and a nice meal to these
pests nnd they are found often In large
cluuters not far from tbe farmers'
doors. In Poo Valley, in different sec
Uonn of the Merrill Valley and alonj;
the Midland road the rabbits arc being
hunted.

eral advantages. It offers ideal excite
ment for the sportsman, it helps to
eiadlcute thin pest from the mtiny
fields of the farmers where they do un
limited harm, and the skins are in a
wit) valuable as furs.
The Klamath Sportsmen's Associa
tion has attempted to get the county
court to take some action against jack
rabbits, such aa offering a bounty,
which will help the farmer to get rid
of his small enemy. As yet. It is not
known whether any action will be tak
en br the court.
Large furrier concerns in the Eait
and Middle West are attempting to es
tablish posts where the pelts of these
animals may be shipped in sufficient
numbers so as to make the trade profit
able. The skins make excellent bat:
nnd this trade can be atlmulatei
ihrough the Eastern and Southern
pans of Oregon, where the jackrabblt
abounds. There is a profit for traders
ho can collect these skins in numbers
Kivat enough to send them to the large
tattlers of the East.
