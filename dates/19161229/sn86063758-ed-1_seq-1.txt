later than the prescribed time for re-, J31

ably none the less appreciated for this m
slight delay Columbia this morning 0
was given one of the farm loan banks
by William G. McAdoo, secretary of C(
the treasury, and the members of tht? *
farm loan board'after one of the most ^
.-interesting and exciting contests with
loO other cities throughout the coun
try. Columbia did net win the fight
lor the bar k without effort. It got 16
into tiie game when, months ago, !t
was practically certain that there 1

future. Following' initial efforts made
at that time, it kept on fighting and
when about three weeks ago, it was '
stated in this correspondence that it
might lose the bank, instead of sulk- m
ing its business men took hold of the
situation with renewed effort, the re
?ult being the presentation of the r.
bank this morning. That Columbia *
has won the fight in competition with
v^such cities as Birmingham,, Nashville*. "
Jacksonville and others, 150 of theifi ?
altogether, speaks well for the con- 1

Washington, Dec. 26.?Germany's 0
jply to President Wilson's note is t
gaixled here as having advanced the i
sace movement another step despite
le fact that it disappoints in not
meting his suggestion 101* an &vov*ai
terms.
The reception Germany's reply re
eives among the Entente Allies,
hose statesmen have publicly uc;
ared against such a proerrniy. n?>?v
scomes the point upon which a fur
ier move' is hingeu. The German

toves in the great game of world
iplomacy all possibly leading 10 aa
pproach for a real discussion o?
*ace terms on grounds which all the
slligerents can feel place them at
3 disadvantage.
This is the official view of Ger
.any's reply so far as it has been for
ulated on the basis of the unofficial
;xt. The official copy had not been
,'ceived tonight and President Wilson
as keeping his mind open.
Neutral diplomatic quarters too.
garded the note as a step toward
2ace and rather leaned to the view
iat G' -uany might follow it with a t
jnfidential communication of some
>rt outlining her terms. e
The view of Ine Entente Allies em- 1
issies, frankly expressed, was that 0
wa3 not an answer to President s
'ilson's note but rather a document n
>r circulation in Germany and in ^
jutral countries with the object of S
oulding opinion to place the res
msibility for continuing the war on
ie Entente. Among the Germanic n
plomats the only view expressed 0
as one of surprise that the reply pre- ?
ided rvceint of the Entente reply to Q
ermany's original peace proposal cf ^
ecember 12. w
It was everywhere agreed that tbe j5
incipal sticking point was the lack ^
a definite statement of terms such tJ
i President Wilson asked and sucn ^
; Lloyd-George declared the Allies v
ould require if they were not to
it their "heads in' a noose with the *
>pe end in the hands of the Ger

diplomacy, however, to find a way ^
bridge the difficulty and Germany's 9
ilure is not regarded as a block to

Germany's declaration that she re- tJ
trds the work of securing the world jj,

Officials who turned back and com- y
ired the statement with the phrases a

i utterances on a world peace to ii

erve for the y<.ar 1917. It was t
eelection, as the entire circle was un
nimously kept at the' various post*
f duty, with one singl exception, anc
hat was his own choice. Mr. R. P
'ranklin, the faithful policeman ai
lie old mill, having decided to movt
o the country next year, was not ar
pplicant for reelection, and his plac*
/as filled by another.
The only position for which thert
fere applicants omer man me m
umbents was that of policeman, anr
here were only about seven" for that
'he absence of opposition speaks as

nimous reelection by an apprecia

I county, living just across the Laurens

; The shooting is said to be the re

Stephens met Jones in a drug store
, at Cross Hill. Stephens asked Jones
[ if lie was armed. Receiving a nega
I tive reply Stephens is said to have
turned as if to retreat, whereupon
j Jones, it is alleged, drew his pistol
_ i and shot Stephens in the right breast.
J As Jones fled through the back door
i. Stephens fired at Jones and then
j fell to the floor paralyzed from the
wound.

;! Negro Found Dead.
Bill Livingston, -colored, who was
a hand at the Oakland cotton mill, was
. found dead in his bed last Saturday
morning. He went home Friday night,
cooked and ate his supper, retiring as
usual apparently well. When he was
being called the next morning early
it was discovered that he was dead,
i He had oaten freely of hickory nuts
and bread the night before. Coroner
F. M. T imlsay was notified of the sud
1 den death and went to investigate.

' to his death from natural causes. He
was about 50 years old.
1! Fell From a Tree.
1' On Mr. Fred Harmon's place near
t Belfast there is a large tree that was
1 killed by the fire which burned Mr.
1 Harmon's house some time ago. The
: big overhanging dead limbs being
1 considered dangerous it was deter
| mined to cut them off. For that pur
' pose Mr. J as. E. Lomax, the father ol
Mrs. Harmon, cnmDea tne iree ou
| Thursday of last week. In some way
he was dislodged from the tre and
fell to the fround, a distance of about
20 feet. Several of his ribs were
broken and he was otherwise badly
bruised up. Dr. W. D. Senn attended
to his injuries and he is getting along
all right. A month or so ago, Dick
Martin, colored, was sent up the tree
to cut off those same limbs, when he
fell out and broke a leg. It seems to
be a hard matter to get those limbs
cut away. Maybe the third trial will
be successful.

that go with a real old time wedding i
dinner in the afternoon. I had no one ' ?
to ask me-to take a 6eat in an auto- 3
mobile, but I hooked up 111 and my j
mascot and we went. Dr. Jas. P. Kin
ard and Mrs. Kinard had known Eu- :
nice at Winthrop . where she was a ]

she graduated, and then she was Dr. { ;

they wanted to go, so I said come! :

"hristmas eve at 3 o'clock in the pres
mce of a few of their friends, was one
>f the most interesting affairs that
las taken place in this community
ecently, when Mr. Furman Bowers
md Mi86 Emma Baker were made
lusband and wife by the Rev. Shell
>f Whitmire. Miss Baker is one of
he most highly and accomplished
laughters of Mr. and Mrs. W. T. Ba
ter. .Mr. Bowers is a dutiful son of
Hr. Pierce Bowers of Prosperity. Af
;er the wedding ceremony the party
eturned to the home of the bride
ivhere one of the mose delicious din
lers was served.
3f the old time houses were built.
Fhere were five plates on the tabie
:hat were on the table at the wedSlngs
if mother and grandmother ut
:he bride. And the old log tire thai
flowed in the broad fireplace took l*.j
jack to the old tire place at the olti
lome of my young boyhood, and spoKe
an eloquent weldome to the guests aa
;hey gathered around.
After the ceremony the guests gath
ered around the long tables that hal
been built for the occasion in the
,-ard, and were served to "everything
food to eat that you could think or
irom turnip and pork and chicken
we and baked chicken 011 down to
:ake and pie and custard and thai
jountry bread?it was fine. Jule Lang
,'ord says there were just 150 cakes,
jut 1 had a sufficiency before a reach
id that. It was a good old country
linner and I enjoyed it.
I had not been further down thii
opri than O'Xeall school house In
nany years. It is a fine country and the
)eople live at home and have plenty
>f all the good things they need to
nake life worth while, ifty gooa
riend of precious memory, Capt. Bin
?ong, used to tell me that I was born
lown there, but I asked my mother
ibout it and she says I was born down
X the old home at Jolly Street, an?l
reckon she knows. At any rate, I
im told that my father did at one
ime run a saw mill near this place.
rhat was a long time ago. :\lr. Lon^
tsed to tell me that when he started
hat mill he had one or those old time
teamboat whistles, and at that time
hey had never heard one. and when
t began to blow the people left' their
>lows and went to the house, they
hought it was old Gabriel's trumpet
ounding the last call. But I reckon
le was joking about it. But that old
thistle does make a terrible noise.
almost equal to the siren that we had
.t Newberry to call out the firemen.
Mr. Shealy lives just about a mile
nd a half from Saluda river. I was
old that there is now no ferry at thi3
lace. It seems to me that this would
e a great inconvenience to the peo
ile on either side, and I know that
lupervisor Sample will soon see thai
he ferry is open. It would mean a
Jt of business taken away from Pros
erity to shut the Saluda people ott.
ust across the river is the rich Del
lar section of Saluda county.
This road from Prosperity on down
r) the river has been worked and wid
ned. but it needs a (op dressing ani
hen the use of the dras and it would
e a fine road. A little cooperation
n the part of the people. And tn*
ounty supervisor, and the tnin~ is
one. Why noNdo'it?
