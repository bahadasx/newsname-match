papers today aie unanimous In pro
nouncing he German answer to Presi
dent Wilson's note to Ihe belligerents
a polite refusal to comply with bis
suggestions.
'Germany," says the Matin, "inten
tionally reverses the terms of Presi
dent Wilson's note and requests repre-
sentatives of the nations at war to seat
themselves at a conference table and
lalk at random without knowing' what.
they intend to say. She knows the

of our duties, It behooves us now morn
I than ever to keep a close watch on tho
movements of the enemy at an hour

Xt Itirect Answer.
The Petit Parisien says:
"Tho renlv of Germane and Austria -
1 iuriuiry Is not 'lire.-t loyi.il misweri
to the American suggestions. It is
only
a hypocritical expedient. Presl-
dent Wilson asks the belligerents to;
state their conditions. The central
powers ignore this and simply offer
a conference without any prelimi
naries. That Is a trap in which they
very naively thought to catch the al
lies. "One understands the baste with
which they replied without waiting
for the concerted note of the allies,
which it is a pity was not sent (arlb r.
President Wilson asked for guaran
tees for the maintenance of last ic;
peace. pcilin and Vienna postponed
their explanations until later. The
president of the rniled stale; can In
no way declare himself salisi'ied. As
for the allies, their reply to the Wash
ington cabinet Is made much easier."
Stephen Pi. hon writes in the Petit
Journal:
"The American not", reeaiding the
inspiration of which we are as yet. not
sufficiently enlightened, has at Ions!
had the merit of unmasking a Herman
maneuver. That is a self-evident
truth which we formulated here fiom

tails of the peace she wished t

In the b'igaro, Alfred f'apus says;
' "(ierniany in her answer to Presi
dent Wilson proposes a meeting of
delegates at a neutral city. That city.
, If it was specified, would remain for
ever famous as the scene of the great
est I rap in history. Prance, not to
speak of our allies, would come out
the vassal of her adversaries of today
and so many prodigious sacrifices, so
much glory won in marvelous battles
would have served to make of us a
subject and a fallen people."
