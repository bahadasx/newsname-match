With Seattle contributing 15.000 signature* to the

20,000 or 22,000 name*.
Still that i* the fact. The rest <»l the Mate onlv 1011-

This demonstrates two things.
One is that the campaign f<>r signatures has l»een too
brief. It lasted les, than *i\ week*, beginning after
the November 7 election. The state, as a whole, hardly
had time to organize for the nonpartisan drive. This is
shmvn so clearly and tragically to nonpartisan interests
—by the fact that Spokane, I verett and the southern
part of the state furnished no signatures a ||_ the
petitions going astray in some manner.
The second point demonstrated by the Nonpartisan
campaign is that Seattle is clearly the queen city of thi-»
state It is big, and broad, and energetic. It has thrown
off the shackles of partisanship and is not afraid to pro
claim it.
Had the re-til* the state done an well, in proportion

'ADMINISTRATION IS

OF MYSTERY; HE SAYS
WASHINGTON, Dec. ?9 Three United
States senators today denotficed the recent
handling of this country's* International af
fairs as a reversion to secret diplomacy.
They declared that not only have recent mat
ters been hedged about with secrecy as far
as the public is concerned but that even the
senate foreign relations committee has not
been given opportunity to know "what is
going on."
The senators who thus voiced disap
proval of this method in handling the coun
try's foreign affairs are Poindexter of Wash
ington, Weeks of Massachusetts and Suther
land of Utah.
"My understanding is that the adminis
tration has declared itself a foe to secret
diplomacy," said Poindexter. "In practice,
however, it has shown itself a past master in
the art of mystery and concealment.
