FATAL AXE TRAGEDY
IN THE QUARTERS
Last Friday night 6 fatal axe mur
der was pulled off in the colored quar
trs, West Welsh, when Earl Coleman
had his jugular vein severed by a blow
from an axe in the hands of uriknKown
partics. Coleman had arri.e. ,-.j m
Sulphur on train No. 4 Priday even
ing' and was stopping it the house of
Emma Jmoes), Later a disturbance
arcse outside the house and Colemani
started out to investigate. As his
heai protruded through the door he
Iecciverl a blow from an axe which
,w'. ered th: jugular vein and made a
'gash about three inches deep in his
nck, from which he died within thir
ty minutes.
Coleman was known as a negro of
good character and he had not been
here long enough to arouse any en
mity, consequently no motive for his
murder is known.
After the inquest, which was con
,'ucted by the parish coroner, Tom Da
vus and Emma King were taken in
charge by deputies and lodged in jail
at Jennings. The testimony of Davis
ar,' 0used another negro, Isaac Jones,
with the crime, but as yet Jones has
not been apprehended.

RICE SENT TO ARGENTINA
AFFECTS HOME MARKET
Shipment of clean rice to Argentina
'\hich fol merly obtained the bulk of
its rice supply from the Orient, is one
of the paradoxes of ocean traffic caus
el by the European war. The effect
has been noted on the New Orleans
markets by the sale of large quanti
tie:; for Buenos Aires and other cen
tc s of population in the southern end
of South America. It was reported
at the New Orleans Board of Trade
Tuesdlay that a large shipment of
clean rice is being loaded on board a
'iionsen line 'steamship for Buenos
Aires at Mobile and that Friday some
22,000 pockets of clean rice, 100
po'-ndts to a pocket, were dispatcheI
:b the Prince liner Afghan Prince.
The Afghan Prince came to New Or
!eans early in December with coffee
from Brazil. She will return with
coffee after discharging her rice and
veneral merchandise at Argentine
ports.
Cheapness of rice this season is
said to have been the means of open
ing a market in the Trans-Missouri
territory as a substitute for potatoes,
on account of the high price. It is
contende,' that the westerners are
learning to use rice with gravies and
that the consumption has been larger
than usual. Hitherto, outside of Lou
isiana and Mississippi, ricewa, used
merely as a dessert and the consump
tion was relatively small. With pota
toes selling at 4 cents a pound, a pound
of rice will feed a family for several
meals for the cost of potatoes for one.
Westerners and northerners are tak
ing advantage of this to reduce their
cost of living.
Mrs. Grace Barbee of Houston,
Texas, spent a most enjoyable time
visiting with home folks, Mr. and Mrs.
B. W. Sargent and family, and with
her little children, Ray and Ruby,
Christmas, returning to Houston the
26th, accompanied by her little son,
Master Ray Barbee.
W. W. BARNES DEAD.
Mr. William W. Barnes, for nearly
forty years a resident of Lake Charles,
widely known throughout Southwest
Louisiana as a traveling salesman,
d:ed December 23rd, from the effects
of a malignant carbuncle, -and the fu
neral services were held Sunday.
Mr. Barnes was the father of Mr.
Percy Barnes, who is well known here
in Welsh. He was a member of the
Woodmen and I. .O. O, F. lodges and
of the United Commercial Travelers.

I
FAMOUS IRISH SOCIALIST
TO VtIT LOUISIANA SOON
The Builder: Corne!ius Lehane of
Ireland will pass through Louisiana
on his way from Los Angeles to New
Or!eans. lie is touring America to
tell the story of the Irish revolution
and how James Connolly, the vetran
socia!ist pioneer at the head of his
army in I)uhlin gave battle to S.000
capitalist troops, held the city of Dub
lin for a week, established a labor re
public, smashed the conscription plans
of the ruling class in Ireland, and
saved the Irish democracy from the
European war. Ireland is the only
country in Europe, within the war
zone, exempted from conscription,
thanks to James Connolly and his gal
lant army of workingmen who decided
to die at home fighting their masters
than to die abroad fighting their
brothers in a foreign land.
Comrade Lehane is the oldest sur
viving colleague of James Connolly,
who was executdl by a firing squad af
ter the battle of Dublin. lie was also
a comrade of Skefiington, editor of
the Citizen, murdered by a military
officer, and is a personal friend of the
Countess de Markievicz, who headed
a detachment of Connolly's army in
the battle. Comrade Lehane will tell
the marvelous story of the heroism of
the Irish socialists who gave their
lives for the cause.
Comiade Lehane was educated at a
famous Irish College, is a speaker of
the first order, and has an interna
tional reputation in the socialist move
ment. He was the first secretary of
the socialist party in Great Britain, i
as well as founder of the movement';
in Ireland with James Connolly. He
has lived in France and Belgium and
is familiar with the regions wherein
tL:. world's battles are now being
f 'ight. His story of the war condi
tions have interested the very larg
est audiences in America, and in 33
states he has been received by the so- c
eialist locals in the largest halls from
New York to San Francisco. This is a
a unique opportunity to hear this
world orator, scholar and man of ac- '
Lion. This will probably be Comrade '
Lehane's only visit to Louisiana.
Comrade Cornelius Lehane will a
speak at Lake Charles, Jennings, La
Fayette, New Orleans and other places I
in this state, on dates which will be
announced later.

I'FANSCHMIDT, TRIED FOR
MURDER, NOW SOLDIER
Intl rnational News Service.
Wichita, Kan., Dec. 28.--Ray Pfan
schmidt, who spent nearly three
years in the Adams county jail in
Illinois, while awaiting trial on
charges of the murder of his father,
mother, sister and Miss Emma Keam
pen at the Pfanschmidt home, near
Quincy, now is a member of the
United States army.
Pfanschmidt, acquitted of the mur
der charges, came to Wichita to start
life anew. HIis start was poor, for
within a few weeks he was arrested
on a charge of stealing two motor
cars and selling them to the com
pany by which he was employed.
.T. A. Potter and R. B. IIastie, Wi
chita business men and owners of the
cars, did not like to send Pfanschmidt
to prison again. They believed some
place where he would be compelled to
submit to discipline would prove more
beneficial. So they offered to have
the case against him dismissed if
Pfanschmidt would enlist in the army.
This was done and he now is learning
soldier duties as a rookie at Fort
Morgan, Colo.,
