FAVORITISM PREVALENT THERE
Political Pull There Keeps
Many From Serving.
Plan Identical to One Issued by
U. S. Government.
j Buenos Aires. Dec. 29. General as
! tonishment was aroused here today
! over the news that the United States
I is considering adoption of a military
i service plan based on that in force in
! Argentina. The public astonishment
1 is based on the bitter criticisms which
! have been leveled at operation of the
plan in this republic.
; Press comment reflects the inability
! of citizens of Argentina to understand
America's consideration of such a sorv
j ice plan. One typical editorial today
wagered that less than 1 per cent of
j American citizens undeistand the sys
i tern "otherwise," it continued, "they
would not want its favoritism in con
j scriptions, due to 'influence or neatly
j placed tips a situation bound to oc
j cur in such a system."
Available for Army, 18 to 45.
The Argentine army plan, accord
ing to information here, makes every
man in that republic between the ages
of 18 and 45 a soldier, men of 18 and
19 and from 30 to 40 belong to the
national guard and are cared for by
the states; men of from 40 to 41 are
territorials, and men from 20 to 30
constitute the "regulars."
At 18 all men must register for ser
vice. From this registry the war de
partment each year selects by lot
from those who have reached 20. the
number of men it requires for the
regular branch. The period of service
is one year in the army and two years
in the navy. For the period after
completing the term of training in the
army or navy until reaching his thir
tieth year, the Argentine soldier re
mains a -"regular, but is not in har
ness. He must practice shooting,
there being a. prescribed minimum per
year; and he is liable to be called on
to attend maneuvers.
School Boy Drill at 12.
After 30, the regular passes again
into the national guard and ceases to
be under orders of, or an expense to,
the federal government, becoming en
tirely a servant of his state. These
men cannot be called on by the fed
eral government for any reason until
all the men between 20 and 30 have
been called.
Tn the public schools boys enter
drilling classes at 12 and at 15 begin
training in marksmanship. Officers
for the regulars are supplied from the
military school, similar to the Ameri
can West Point. They are taught for
four years and join the army as sub
lieutenants. Kxemptions from the plan are made
for illness and physical defects as well
as for economic necessity this latter
including only sons of widows, men
with brothers or sisters dependent
upon them and others similarly sit
uated. But unless actually poverty
stricken those exempted must pay a
small tax annually for their exemption.
Act Under National Defense Law.
Washington, Dec. 28. Every able
bodied male citizen of the United
States between 18 and 45 years is sub
ject, without further act of congress,
to be drafted into the army. It be
came known today.
Under the national defense act. the
militia bureau of the war department
two months ago framed the regula
tion, which was made public only to
day. It directs that where a national
guard regiment is called out of its
state for war service a reserve train
ing battalion to fill vacancies at the
front shall be organized. .
. "If for any reason," the order says,
! "there shall not be enough reservists
or enough voluntary enlistments to or
ganize or to keep the reserve battalions
i at prescribed strength, a sufficient
! number of the unorganized militia
; shall be drafted by the president to
maintain such battalion or lesser unit
at the prescribed strength.'
The language follows closely that of
that national defense act in which the
unorganized militia is defined as in
cluding every able bodied male citi
( zen without the prescribed age limit.

Aug., Sept. Banner Months,
Earn $1,418, $1,409 per Mile.
Chicago, Dec. 29. Record breaking
traffic and earnings for American rail
ways were recorded in 1916, according
to compilations from official sources
published by the Railway Age Gazette
today in its annual review number.
The increased earnings have been
followed immediately, it ia set forth,
by increased expenditures- for equip
ment for export, as well as for do
mestic delivery. During the year
170,000 freight cars were ordered by
American roads, in addition to 2.349
passenger cars and 2,923 locomotives,
the total being greatly in excess of that
for the previous- year. For export,
25,632 freight cars were ordered and
2,983 . locomotives, an aggregate in
crease of approximately 100 per cent.
Oiicrutiiig Expense Increases.
Construction increase totaled 1.098
miles, an increase over 1915, but be
low normal.
"The net operating income of the
railways during the year just closing,
the 'Gazette said, "has been unprece
dented, probably averaging more than
6 per cent on the investment in road
and equipment. Until within the last
eighteen months, average gross earn
ings per mile per month had exceeded
$1,300 in only one month in October,
1912. In three months of the present
year, however May, June and July
more than $1,300 per mile was earned.
In August and September all previous
records were broken with earnings of
$1,418 and $1,409 per mile."

note of President Wilson.
Copenhagen. Dec. 29. Norway, j
Sweden and Denmark are either send- j
ing. or soon will send peace notes to ;
belligerent European powers, accord-
ing to the newspaper. Politiken. j
The majority of the Scandinavian i
newspapers approve of the peace move j
by the Scandinavians. j
Some newspapers, however, have ;
sharply criticised the move, alleging it :
is useless in view of Germany's reply ;
to President Wilson's note.
Consider It Their Duty.
According to the Exchange Tele
graph company, Denmark. Sweden and
Norway, following on interchange of ,
negotiations, have "instructed their !
respective legations to deliver peace I
notes to belligerents similar to that !
dispatched by President Wilson, stat-j
ing those nations would betray their ;
duty to mankind if they did not ex- '
prejs warm sympathy in all efforts!
conducive to putting an end to the suf- '
ferings and losses', moral as well as '
material, which are constantly in- j
creasing." j
The Copenhagen dispatch declared !
the notes will express the hope that j
President Wilson's "initiative will lead j
to a result worthy of the sublime idea
dominating him."

Washington, Dec. 29. Turkey's re

was received today at the state depart- j

Germany's and Austria's. j
Allies Notp About Wednesday.
London, Dec. 29. As a result of the
conferences which have been in prog
ress for several days the entente reply ;
to the German note is now completed. :
It could go forward today or tomorrow '
except for the necessary formality of
transmitting it to all the allies before ,
final delivery. This means that the
delivery will be made rarly in or in the
middle of next week, perhaps on ,
Wednesday.
The delivery will be made at Paris,
after which the communication will
be forwarded to Germany thru Amer
ican channels.
The reply is a very long document,
much longer than the German note.
MAY CALL RA1LSTR1KE
Brotherhoods Demand Increase ly
Jan. 1 as Provided by 8-Hour Law.
New Tork. Dec. 29. The refusal of
railroads to agree to operation of the
Adamson 8-hour law with its subse
quent $5,000,000 monthly increase in
salary for railroad employes beginning
January 1, may presage sporadic
strikes on roads thruout the country,
it was believed today. The employes
insist on the law's being put into force '
January 1. !
The railroads refused to accept the ;
terms of the law until a decision has
been given by the United States su
preme court.
A compromise similar to that effect
ed with the switchmen's union was re
fused by the brotherhoods.

FAVOR DRJVLBLACHLY
Hcriiigton Man Boosted tor Secretary
ship Eoard of Control.
Prominent business and professional
men of Herington this afternoon urged
Governor Capper to appoint Dr. E. M.
Blachly of Herington as secretary of
the state board of control, to succeed
Senator J. W. Howe of Abilene. Ap
pointment of a new secretary of the
state board will probably be an
nounced next month, as a change in
the administration of the office is ex
pected in February or March.
Dr. Blackly has been prominent in
Republican affairs in IMckinson cjn
ty and in the Filth district. He served
four years as clerk of the district court
and is recognized as one of the Repub
lican leaders in Herington. His can
didacy for the secretaryship of the
control board was strongly urged by
Dickinson county citizens who today
presented the matter to Governor Cap
per. D. C. Lamb, who represented
Dickinson county in the 1915 legisla
ture as a Progressive member, came

Addresses Long Note on Policy

Madrid, Dec. 29. The note ad
dressed to Germany on the submarine
question by the Spanish government
reviews at length the policy of Madrid
from the time the first Spanish ship,
the Isidore was torpedoed in August.
1915. It declares that the Spanish
government" has always maintained
that it was illegal to destroy prizes as
is the constant practice of submarines
and that the cabinet also demanded
the observation of the Declaration of
London, notably Article 50, which, it
maintained, submarines violate by
abandoning the crews of sunken ship.
to the mercy of the waves far from
land.
The note further recalls the vigor
of the representation of the Spanish
government which, it w:iys. sometimes
caused the Berlin government to be
surprised at the radical attitude cf
Spain whose protests, it is held, havo
been more energetic than those of any
other neutral state, even the United
States of America.
Madrid Protest a Surprise Here.
Washington, Dec. 2 9. Spain's ac
tion toward the German submarine
campaign caused surprise here because
no such vigorous statement from Spain
had been expected. Spain's action,
nevertheless, is thought to have come
at an opportune time to add another
pource of pressure on Germany in
what the state department considers
a most serious situation.
Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and
Holland also have suffered disas
trously from submarine activities, but
no indication has been given as yet
that they also were planning action at
this time.
The United States w ill welcome such
protests by other neutrals, hut in line
with its consistent policy will probably
not join" in any united action w ith
them.

U. S. TO BEGONE MESSENGER?
Unbridled U-Boat Warfare if
Peace Fails, Sure.
Some Outspoken, Peace Moves
Have Been Bungled.
Washington. Dec. 29. Three United
States senators today denounced the
recent handling of this country's in
ternational affairs as a reversion to se
cret diplomacy. They declare dthat
not only have rec ent matters been
hedged about with secrecy as far as
the public is concerned, but that even
the senate foreign relations committee
has not been given opportunity to
know "what is going on."
The senators who thus voiced dis
approval of this government's methods
in handling the country's foreign af
fairs, are I'oindexter of Washington
state. Weeks of Massachusetts and
Sutherland of Utah.
"My understanding is thst the pres
ent administration has declared itself
an ardent foe to secret diplomacy,"
said Poindexter. "In practice, how
ever, it has shown itself a pastmaster
in the art of mystery and concealment.
"There are veiled rumors of secret
policies affecting the vital interests of
the country which the president will
commit to us without consulting us.
There is even a debate of public men
as to the ultimate extreme limits 'of
the constitutional powers of the presi
dent to set aside the Monroe doctrine,
for instance:
"To enter into a league of peace
or nerree to do so: or to commit the
country to that policy without the ad
vice and consent ot tne senate.
Great Moves Without Advice.
"What is more important is that
these great movements are taken with
out the advice and consent of public
opinion which is supposed to be the
governing factor in a democracy such
as-this.
"It is 'far 1etter that" secret "di
plomacy insofar as vital policies are
concerned should be done away with
forever."
"I am at a loss to account for the
secret moves being made by the ad
ministration," said Senator Weeks. "It
places the people in an embarrassing
position. After a step is taken the
people are compelled to support the
president, even tho they may have dif
ferent opinions concerning the mat
ter." '
"The president formerly conferred
with the committee on foreign rela
tions on matters of this character,"
said Senator Sutherland. "About
three years ago, when the Mexican
situation was foremost in public inter
est, he suddenly stopped these con
ferences. He is not obliged to confer
with anyone, butg reater results could
be obtained by the old method, I am
sure."
Will Pass Terms Secretly.
Washington. Dec. 29. If Germany
desires that the United States pass
along any secret peace terms for the
entente allies to consider at a round
Stable session, this government will lend
i itself to that work.
j A high state department official
! said this today, but qualified his re-
marks by emphasizing that the United
I States would be acting "merely as a
messenger.
"Acting in such a capacity," this
official said, "would be no impro
priety." Those officials who have talked with
the British ambassador. Sir Cecil
Spring-Rice, say the allies never will
consent to what appears to be Ger
many's present chief objective, namely
the calling of a conference, before spe
cific peace terms are publicly an
nounced. Negotiations Bungled?
Meantime there is talk among con
gressmen that affairs have been bun
gled: that secret . diplomacy is being
tried. And this talk is not confined
to capitol hill.
An administration official today used
the word "bungle" in describing his
view of the manner in which the state
department handled the publicity ar
rangements regarding the president's
peace notes and the subsequent Lans
ing interpretations especially the
first, which he said was "obviously
unpremeditated."
Whether there be secret diplomacy
or not, there is frankly and admittedly
the deepest kind of secrecy over de
velopments at this stage. Both Secre
tary of State Lansing and President
Wilson Jiave agreed between them
selves not to talk peace matters at
least not the portions thereof that will
be in any way embarrassing to them
from an administration standpoint.
DEMAND MORirPEP"
French Socialists Urge Gov't to Adopt
More Vigorous Warfare.
Paris, Dec. 29. A resolution has
been adopted by the Socialist con
gress calling upon the government to
pursue a more vigorous policy, both in
military and in economic action, so
that the full resources of the country
may be brought into play and the war
terminated more speedily.
The resolution is predicated on the
assertion that the replies of the cen
tral powers to President Wilson's note
leave no doubt that the offer of peace
was a snare.
Deputies who met German and oth
er foreign Socialist delegates at the
conference in Switzerland supported a
motion in favor of resumption of in
ternational relations among Socialists.
This proposal was defeated by a small
majority after a long and heated discussion.
Gigantic Efforts To Be Revived
on All Fronts.
rGANT BREAK GERMAN LINES
British Offensive Pending Be
tween Lille and Ypres.
Renewal Peace Talk Next Sum
mer Depends on Results.
Berlin. Dec. 29 (via wireless).
Judging from unofficial reports from
the front and diplomatic comment, the
peace efforts President Wilson, the
central powers and Switzerland are
now making will not succeed imme
diately in bringing the war to an end.
That the war will not end without
the allies making another gigantic
concentrated effort to break the Ger
man front, is indicated by the artil
lery preparations which are being
made.
England, in the west, her allies in
r.rerp iind Russia in Rumania, ap
parently expect to accept Von Hind
enburg's challenge for winter battle.
When these battles begin, peace talk
will probably subside to await the
outcome of the bitter struggles.
It is believed in Berlin that Eng
land intends to give Lloyd-George a
trial as premier. Considerable de
pends on his efforts, it is believed here,
whether peace talk is revived in the
summer or fall after the issue has
again been tested by men and steel on
the fighting fronts.

trade commission reopened hearings
today in its news print paper investi
gation, taking up the inquiry where it

making machines to other classes of
work. Manufacturers have contended
prices are reasonable, that the makers
are privileged to produce the kind of
paper that pays the largest profit.

auction from present prices, obtaining
the bulk of their supplies under the
arrangement supervised by the com
mission by which large publishers
would relinquish a part of their nor
mal supply of paper for next year.

SEIZE RELIEF MEN
Deport Belgians Employed by
American Commission.
43 Charity Workers Among 400
Taken From Arlon.
London, Dec. 29. Gernjany Is now
going so far in her Belgian deporta
tions as to arrest and transfer from
Belgian soil Belgians engaged In relief
work and hitherto protected by the
card of the American Relief commis
sion. Such charge was made today by the
Belgian ministry of justice.
"Not only are the Germans deport
ing men who are still employed' the
ministry asserted, "not only are they
carrying off children from 16 to 11
years of age, and factory managers;
farmers and physicians, but they are
now brutally arresting for deportation
Belgians engaged in the relief of their
own countrymen.
Calls Them 5 'Slave Raids."
'This new outrage haa been com
mitted In at least three cities. At
Gembloux two chiefs of the local
agency of the relief commission and
two other members of the organiza
tion were deported. At Li b ram on t
twenty-one employes of the national
relief committee were deported. ;
"During a slave raid at Arlon,
forty-three employes of the local re
cional aarenries of thA rHf fnmmla.
J sion were among 400 men taken to
Germany.
"This suffices to prove that when
the German authorities defend their
policy of deportations on the ground
that they are thus checking unemploy
ment they are merely trying to bluff
neutrals. '
