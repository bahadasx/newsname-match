United Action Thru Chamber
of Commerce Would Help
Very Materially
A spiendid opportunity is now
given the Safford Chamber of
Commerce to get busy on the
proposition of a main line thru
the Gila valley to Phoenix
It has become known lately
that the Southern Pacific has
taken up the matter of building
the line from San Carlos thru
the box canyon to Christmas
and there is very little doubt but
that the company would accom
plish this thirty miles of road
which would give the Gila valley
a thru line from the East to the
coast by way of Phoenix if it
can secure the low line thru the
canyon thus making an almost
gradeless route in Quick time
and at a much lower cost to the
company than the proposed high
line
Ine low line is feasible and the
company would no doubt lose
very little time in building the
line if it can be secured and the
people of this valky should get
together thru the chamber of
commerce and help the company
secure the low line right-of-way
thru the box canyon
Several years ago an army
board of engineers reported in
favor of a storage dam at San
Carlos The matter was pushed
by individuals who were getting
good money from the people
around Florence and Casa
Grande valley It was shown
that the dam would cost a huge
sum of money considering the
amount of acreage it
benefit At the same time every
Gila valley farmer knew that the
San Carlos dam would be of no
benefit at all to valley lands and
that much litigation would ensue
to preserve the water rights of
land owners in this valley
The fact of the matter is that

The Rabbit Hunt
A Great Success
The rabbit hunt in Artesia
Wednesday resulted in the kill
ing of 720 rabbits Forty five
men participated in the hunt
which began at 900 a m and
finished at 300 p m
As a result of the count of the
rabbits bagged by each hunter
it was found that Elmer Welker
killed 132 and won first prize
1000 cash Warren Bingham
killed 120 and won second prize
500 cash Bill Foster killed 98
and won third prize a box of

theSan Carlos dam is not feasible1110 u MiMrri niivw
and if ever undertaken would be vocaisoio Holy Night
an exDensive proposition with Madame Loeser
vcrv little benefit to those who are
backing it and further it is al- I
most certain that it would be
years before the government
would ever take up the matter
seriously and start the work
We find now through the able
efforts of Congressman Hayden
that congress has provided for
diversion dams for the upper and
lower parts of the Pima Indian
reservation which will include
service for lands around Florence
and Casa Grande valley This
being true there is no need of a
storage dam at San Carlos and
the government should not build
it
What the people want is a
main line railroad thru the valley
to Phoenix and the coast and
when it is accomplished our
farmers will realize the great
benefits from reduced freight
rates for all its products as well
as a better passenger service at
much lower rates than they have
to pay now
The Guardian believes the
time is propitious for the people
of the Gila valley to get together
thru the chamber of commerce
and take up this matter of getting
a main line and helping the
Southern Pacific carry out its
plans in building the lower grade
line thru the box canyon

pressing confidence that every
tally of Inspector Homer Wood

Governor Hunt in the guber
natorial election contest left for
Tucson tonight
Ives has advised Hunt to re
tain possession of his quarters at
the State House unless between
now and Monday the inspection
should show changes in the
totals less favorable to the con
testant
The presumption of Camp
bells election by a majority of
30 has been overthrown and on
this showing I would advise the
governor not to turn over the of
fice Monday said Ives
Ives admitted that there was
a possibility that the status
might be changed between now
and the expiration of the Hunt
term He claimed however a
total net gain for Hunt of 77
votes in the inspection thus far
which was based not on disputed
ballots but upon the actual
count changing the official fig
ures in a number of precincts
With three boards working
the inspectors are going over an
average of 6000 ballots a day
23000 have been counted and
42000 remain This places the
end of the inspection on Jan 6th
Board No 2 created a record
today when they passed on 2

Inspector Wilson and Sheriff
Alger Make an Im
portant Arrest
MAN WANTED FOR DESERTION
Gave Name of Otto Schutz and
Had Major Grinsteads Horse
in His Possession
I While on his way home from a
trip in the country adjacent to
Bonita Creek last Wednesday
Inspector Nelse Wilson stopped
at the Hat ranch At this place
he ran across a man who was
camped nearby and who gave
the name of Otto Schutz
I In a conversation with Schutz
the latterdisclosed the fact that
he had been a member of the
National Guard on the border
1 This statement aroused the of-
I fleers suspicion that Schutz was
I a deserter and this suspicion was
I somewhat strengthened when he
found that Schutz was carrying
an officers automatic pistol
Later the inspector through
another source found that the
horse Schutz rode into the coun
try was stolen
Inspector Wilson left camp
early Friday morning and on
reaching town sought Private
Tom Campbell who was here on
furlough and whom Schutz men
tioned he knew when on the
border
From the description given of
Schutz by Inspector Wilson
Campbell recognized him as a
man named John Stokes a mem
ber of the supply company First
Arizona Infantry Campbell also
1 recognized from the description
of the horse that it was Major
Grinsteads horser which disap
peared several months ago from
Naco about the same time that
Stokes took French leave from
camp
Convinced that Schutz was not
only a deserter but a horse thief
as well Inspector Wilson accom
panied by Sheriff Alger left here
early Saturday morning for
Schutzs camp at Bonita Creek
Arriving there about 000
oclock the inspector advarced
alone to Schutzs camp Schutz
saw him coming and at first not
recognizing Wilson stepped lack
and placed his hand on his gun
The inspector continued towird
Schutz and held out his hand
saying Good morning Schutz
Schutz recognized him and ad
vanced toward Wilson holding
out his hand and when he was
near enough the inspector grab
bed his hand and slipped Schutzs
gun out of the holster Sheriff
Alger came up at this time and
they put the handcuffs on their
prisoner who was a verv much
surprised and disgusted man
When Schutz recovered his
composure to a degree that he
could talk he told the officers
1 that if he had any suspicion of
their business with him he would
have killed them He did not
hesitate to express his feelings
in language that would not look
well in print
The officers placed their pris
oner on a mule and started im
mediately to town bringing
Major Grinsteads horse with
them also saddle and several
blankets all stolen property
1 The party arrived here Satur
day evening and Schutz was
placed in the county jail and a
wire sent to Colonel Tuthill an
nouncing Schutzs capture Colo
nel Tuthill answered that a guard
of soldiers would be sent at
once
Sunday night Sergeant Joe
Swift and Privates Clarence
Spalding Sam Freeman Bruce

Sergeant Swift had orders to
return with his squad and pris
oner Tuesday morning and they
left for the border town on Tues
day mornings train accompanied
by Private Tom Campbell
1 Major Grinsteads horse was in
such bad condition that it was
I unfit for traveling and will be
