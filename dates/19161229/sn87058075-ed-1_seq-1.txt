and'
mother.
Mrs. Streinz was converted and
united with the Methodist Episcopal

attended every faithfully almost in
variably occompanied by her three
children. She was also a member of

Fatalities of Foot Ball
Lyle Kingsley, who was injured a
month ago in a foot ball game between
Preston and Spring Valley, died at his
home in the latter city Wednesday,
Dec., 13th, one of this year's fifteen

for sensational and dangerous games.
That the demand is- on the increase
witness the fact that 78,000 people at
tended the recent game bfetween Yale
and Harvard. Fifteen young men fa
tally injured in foot ball games in a
single season, to say nothing of others
crippled and otherwise injured for life!
And for what? When a man gives up
a son on the field of battle the thought
that he has given to hip country les
sens his sorrow in some degree. What
can comfort one who has sacrificed a
•on upon the "gridiron" for the sake
of -sport"?
"Civiliiation" at tlw Opera Haute
"Civilization, the startling cinema
production that comes to the Opera
House, Dec. 29 and 30, has been pro
claimed by press, pulpit and educators
to be the most stupendous production
ever shown. Undoubtedly the present
war has given a keen interest to the
spectacle. The picture is an allegori
cal story of warthat has laughed at the
world's flaunting boast of a higher
progress. It pictures the awfulness of
a world mad with the bloodlust of con
quest. It shows how half the manhood
of a world may be swept by the ter
