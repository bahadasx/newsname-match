had great difficulty in engaging ne

Sut this time he struck a bargain

j The Clever Weaver Bird.
! An interesting bird is the "wear
er." It seems to be fond of mak
ing enormous nests merely for tho
purpose of exercise in the art of
construction. Supply these birds
with strings and straw, and they
will use them up rapidly, and their
.fabric is woven with a perfectnesa
j that is astonishing. In some coun
tries it is the custom of the weaver
birds to colonize and build one big
flat topped platform, two or three
yards across, which is so admirably
put together as to shed the rain as
well as any roof could do. Under
this roof they make individual pock
et shaped nests, bringing up under
this unique structure a large and
interesting family of little weavers.
There is another bird, called the
"tailor," which, instead of weaving
its nest, incloses it in big leaves an
stitches the latter together with
plant libers, just as one would seif
piece of cloth.
