, Called in to Participate in Consideration of Guarantees
, for Future Peace President Wilson and Secretary
- Lansing Have Adopted a Policy of Absolute Silence.
Washing-ton, Dec. 28. A policy of
Absolute silence regarding the peace
negotiations has been adopted by
President Wilson and Secretary Lan
sing. It was stated officially today
that all steps henceforth will be re
garded as confidential, that no com
ment will be made on any develop
ment and that rumors will not be dis
cussed. ; Confidential Exchange of Terms.
' The decision to pursue this course
was made known after the state de
partment had received the official
texts of the German and Austrian re
plies to President Wilson's identical
notes to the belligerents proposing a
discussion of peace terms, and after it
Was learned that the Teutonic powers
would be willing to permit a confi
dential exchange of tentative terms if
it became necessary to do so to bridge
the gap threatening to prevent a gath
ering of peace delegates.
" . Secret Exchanges.
In many quarters the official atti
tude was construed as indicating that
teecret exchanges weretexpected to 'fol
low, if they did not precede, the for
mal answers of the entente nations to
the notes of President Wilson and the
central powers. Eecause o the highly
confidential nature of any such nego
tiations, it is pointed out, .the inter
mediary would be obliged to refrain
from admitting even that they were in
progress.
So far as the entente governments
are concerned, it is understood that
little if any confidential information
has reached - here to shed more light
on their attitude than has been given
publicly in -the speeches of their pre
miers and the comment of their press
Consequently there is no disposition
here to doubt that the allies unani
mously will refuse to enter any sort of
peace conference until Germany has
indicated clearly on what conditions
she will- stop fighting.
On the Teutonic side, while the reply
to President Wilson is regarded by
the German embassy is complying with
President Wilson's suggestion in of
fering a method of procedure, Ger
many is said to be willing to consider
other suggestions regarding methods
from any other quarter, including her
enemies.

INTERNAL CONDITIONS IN
AUSTRIA-HUNGARY SERIOUS
Swiss Reports a Willingness to Nego
tiate With Great Britain For Peace.
London, Dee. 29, 2.30 a. m. Recent
reports received from Switzerland hn-e
represented the Internal conditions in
Austria-Hungary as so serious that
those governments are prepared to ne
gotiate direct with Great Britain and
France preferring a humiliating peace
to what has been termed inevitable
bankduptcy and ruin.
The Mo-Vtng Post's Budapest cor
respondent writing December 22 rec
ords opinions to the foregoing effect
as being prevalent in some quarters in
Austria-Hungary, but in nowise con
firms the view that they are favored
by the Austrian and Hungarian gov
ernments. On the contrary, the cor
respondent contends that however
much a separate peace may be desired
it Is almost unthinkable, and centain
ly for the present impossible. He
concurs with the Swiss reports as far
as saying that the young emperor is
eager to work for peace.
, "It is generally recognized," says
the correspondent, "that the emperor,
after he has been crowned king of
Hungary and taken the oath to the
constitution in the Austrian parliament
will try to re-establish peace. There
in little doubt that he will use his in
fluence on Germany In as friendly a
way as Is possible and if this influence
should fall will use other kinds of
pressure on Germany which Germany

ment'further are represented as being
as follows:
If the entente considers the guaran
tees for the future are the principal
elements to be achieved, and, lacking
confidence in the German government,
insists upon knowing something of the
guarantees that Germany is willing to
give, the Berlin government might
make some declaration regarding the
principles to which she is willing to
subscribe, leaving details for settle
ment at the proposed conference. The
German government considers that
there is little to be gained by going
into any lengthy discussion of guaran
tees for the future with the present
war in progress. In this connection,
Germany, it is asserted, never has in
tended that the conference suggested
should result immediately in the es
tablishment of peace; it is considered
that it necessarily would be of a pre
liminary nature to determine whether
it might not be possible to end the
war. - - ...
, The German Plan.
According to the German diplomats,"
the plan Germany is proceeding upon
would provide that the- delegates
should first agree upon territorial and
immediately connected terms and that
a preliminary tentative treaty then
should be settled upon. This com
pleted, tho German idea is to have all
the neutrals called in to participate in
consideration of the questions of
guarantees for the future. They re
gard it as a matter for the conference
to settle whether the neutral nations
should become signatory to the entire
peace treaty or only to that part hav
ing to do with . guarantees for the
maintenance qf peace in the future,
s"ch as freedom of the seas, limitation
of armaments, formation of a world
league to enforce peace and establish
ment of an international court of arbi
tration. Diplomats familiar with the view
point of Germany and her allies were
especially emphatic tonight in snying
that Germany necessarily would be
able to make much better terms in
confidential negotiations than in pub

INFLUENCE OF WAR
ON POLITICAL ECONOMY
Subject Dwelt on by New Hungarian
Finance Minister.
London, Dec. 28, 6 p. m. A despatch
to Reuter's Telegram company from
Amsterdam quotes the following re
ceived there from Vienna:
'Addressing the officials of his de
partment on the subject of the influ
ence of the war on political economy
and the regulation of economic affairs
with Hungary, Alexander Spitzmueller,
the new finance minister, emphasized
the urgent need of economy and the
promotion or export trade.
"Perhaps the most important con
crete fact, said Herr Spitzmueller, had
been the extraordinary increase in the
state debt, which made the restoration
o fthe monetary standard one of the
most important problems. A systemat
ic policy of production would be the
chief means for placing the country's
political and economical position and
its monetary standard" on a sound basis
again. Herr Spitzmueller further em
phasized the necessity that the inter
est on the war loans be completely
coveed by fresh sources of revenue
and that a taxation policy should pro
vide for a just ana systematic dis
tribution of the immense cost of the
war."

LONDON TIMES CALLS
. FOR GREATER EFFORT
' .
Military Expert Says They Must Have
More Equipment and Men.
London, Dec- 29, 3.40 a. m. The
Times' military correspondent today
calls for greater British effort In . the
war. He contends that although the
French are still .strong their reserves
are less numerous than could . be
wished for. Russia, he adds, will bring
new armies into the field in 1917, but
tneir useiuiness depends on their be
ing provided with heavy guns; air
planes and mechanical transports.
while Russia's poor railway stystems
and other causes point to the neces
sity, of not exaggerating what Russia
can do. Italy, says the correspond
ent cannot easily increase her forces
appreciably. After admitting that
Great Britain has done a bis share
in the work at Bea and financed and
equipped the entente allies, the cor
respondent continues: "There a nura
ber of changes to . be effected be
fore we can say we are winning the'
war. Germany met us in the autumn
with 27 new divisions and thereby se
cured a strategic reserve which en
abled her to conduct the campaign in
Rumania without disaster in the west
We must not only counter disposi
tions of this character in time, but
must be beforehand in the future. The
reserves of manhood in the British
Isles and dominions are ample for 30
divisions, to expand munition works
and to meet all legitimate demands of
the navy, the home defense and air
services. Nearly 4,000,000 men of mili
tary age are still in civil life.
The limit for age liability is still
four years below the German stand
ard and no answer has yet been made
to the German auxiliary service act.
"What is needed is vigor in the
government and single minded deter
mination' to win the war. We have a
larger reserve of manhood than Ger
many and the annual contingents of
youths in France and Lngland to
gether are greater than the annual
contingents in Germany. It is
no longer possible to think of win
ning the war by half measures. The
new premier should state to the coun
try the measures necessary for vie
tory and stand or fall by them with
the courage we know him to possess."

TO STOP SNIPING
AT AMERICAN OUTPOSTS
Carranza Authorities in Juaraez Seach
Huts For Firearms.
El Paso, Texas, Dec. 28. In an ef
fort to stop further sniping at the
American outposts here, the Carranza
authorities in Juarez arrested a Mex
ican civilian and searched huts for
firearms on the Mexican side of the
Rio Grande, near the scene of the
trouble, it was announced in Juarez
tonight.
Mexican Consul Soriano Bravo said
tonight that General Jose Murguia.
commander at Juarez, attributed last
nisrht's outbreak to some loose horses
wandering in the bed of the Rio
Grande. The American guardsmen.
General Murguia said, according to'
consul jsravo, evidently mistook the
horses for hostile Mexicans and open
ed fire. A few shots were probably
sent from the Mexican side in answer
but only after the Americans had fired
first, in Murguia s opinion.
Consul Bravo said he heard on good
authority that American regular army
officers on the scene confirmed the'
Mexican contention that the guards
men fired first.

STR. MARYLAND REGARDED
AS PROBABLY LOST.
Coast Guard Cutters Have Not Been
Able to Find Any Trace of Her.
Nantucket, Mass-, Dec. 28. The
steamship Maryland was regarded as
probably lost today. Search for the
vessel and crew by the coast guard
cutters Acushnet and Gresham, which
was begun after the Maryland's wire
less calls of distress were silenced by
waters Shat flooded her engine room
on Christmas night, was abandoned
without having developed any trace of
either, flotsam round by the cutters
could not be identified as being from
the Maryland. Hope for the safety
of the steamer's thirty odd men lies
in the possibility that they were pick
ed up from the ship's boats by a pass
ing steamer.
The cutters had circled for more
than thirty hours in the waters south
east of this island, in the vicinity of
the position given by the Maryland's
wireless operator when he sent out his
call for help.
The steamship, recently converted
from a Great Lakes cargo carrier to
an oceangoing craft by her owners,
the Crew Levick company of Philadel
phia, had been given a top rating of
seaworthiness and it was believed she
must have received a very severe buf
feting in the northwest storm of Mon
day night to go down so quickly.

An all Day Hearing
on Gar Shortage
BY THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE
COMMISSION
R. R. MAGNATES PRESENT
Vice President W. W. Atterbury of the
Pennsylvania Road Opposed Order
ing of All Railroads to Return Cars
of Other Lines to Their Owners Im
mediately Upon Unloading.
Washington. Dec 28. After an all
day hearing,4 the Interstate Commerce
Commission tonight took under ad
visement the question of whether it
shall seek to solve the car shortage
problem by ordering all -railroads to
return cars of other lines to their
owners immediately upon unloading.
Say Roads Are Doing Their Best,
Railroad representatives, headed by
W. W. Atterbury, vice president of the
Pennsylvania, and president of the
American Railway Association, ap
pearing in response to a summons to
show cause why such an order should
not be issued, earnestly urged against
the action. They declared that most
of the roads -were doing their best
now to deal fairly with the public and
argued that a hard and fast rule by
the cofmission would interfere with
operations and make the situation
worse.
Violated Agreements.
Commissioner McChord said the
railroads seemed to pay no attention
to the orders of the railway associa
tion, which has adopted various dras
tic measures to relieve car shortage.
"The railroads, lie said, not only
have violated their written and verbal
agreements but they have deliberately
been engaged in the pastime of steal
ing cars from each other.
When Mr. Atterbury objected, say
ing that statement could not be ac
cepted as true, Mr. McChord said he
had seen a letter from one president
stating that other executives were not
going to heed the orders of the asso
ciation's car service committee. ,
No Time for an Arbitrary Order.
"Don't blame the whole system, of
railroads because the present intricate
plan is not working as smoothly as
we would like to see it," replied Mr.
Atterbury. He contended further that
the present was no tife for an arbi
trary order by the commission: that
January, February, March and possi
bly April were months m which rail
road operation would be mist diffi
cult, particularly as the railroads had
not time to work out the. new car
service distribution plans.
No Car Shortage for Normal Traffic.
There is no car shortage for nor
mal trafHC, Mr. Atterbury insisted, and
ere should be no hard and fast com
mission order based on an abnormal
situation, which, for instance, had
transformed the Pennsylvania from
car creditor business originator, to a
distributing system, for other lines
originating traffic.
Refusal of Grand Trunk to Pay
Mr. Atterburv said the railroads did
not know what might be done about
the refusal of the Grand Trunk sys
tem to pay the 75 cents per diem in
creased rate for foreign cars on Its
line. "We might." he added, "refuse
to load cars into SCanada over the
Grand Trunk but that fight shut oft
the coal supply of Canada, which
comes entirely from the United
States." He said some action might
be evolved in Canada to deal with the
situation.
Praise for New Haven Road.
New England, the witness said, al
ready had straightene dotit its traffic
and conditions never had been bet
ter there. He pointed out .particularly
what had been accomplished by the
New Haven.
All the railroad men scented danger
in any commission order because of
the law imposing a $5,000 fine for vio
Infinnq of interstate commerce com
mission orders. W. A. Wofthington
vice president of the Southern Pacific,
said the western lines have a large
excess of open cars and deficiency of
box car equipment and that the pro
posed order, if rigidly enforced, might
subject his line to an accumulation of
$23,000,000 in fines.
ABRUPT DISCONTINUANCE
OF RAILROAD CONFERENC
When It Became Apparent an Agree
ment Could Not be Reached.
New York. Dec. 28. Conferences be
tween representatives of the railroads
and the four brotherhoods of railway
employes at which the possibilities of
a settlement of the eight hour con
troversy were discussed were discon
tinued abruptly today when it be
came apparent an agreement could
not be reached.
Beth sides announced that there
would be no more meetings until af
ter the United States supreme court
hands down its decision on the con
stitutionality of the Adamson act.
The break came, it was learned,
when the railroad representatives re-
tused to concede me acmanus oi wm
brotherhood chiefs for an agreement
lookinsr towards the enforcement of
the new. wage schedule, fixed by the
Adamson law, which goes into effect
January 1.
The brotherhood chiefs held, it was
said, that their men had the right to
begin drawing the scale of wages
mediately after the law became ef
fective, irrespective of the suits
brought by the railroads to test its
validity.

modification of the protocol provid
ing for the withdrawal of American
troops rrom Mexico is made bv Gen
eral Carranza in a message delivered
to secretary jane today by Luis Ca
brera, chairman of the Mexican mem
bers of the Joint commission. The
Mexican first chief replied to the in
sistent American demand that the
protocol signed by hi3 spokesmen at
Atlantic City be ratified, with an eight
hundred word document in which .he
failed to accede to the demand, but
refrained from writing" anything that
could be construed as a flat repudia
tion.
Suggestions to be Considered.
The latest suggestions for chana-ea
in the agreement now will be consid
ered by the three American represen
tatives secretary Lane, J. R. Mott
and Judge George Gray. Secretary
Lane advised his colleagues late to
day or the character of the reply and
asked them to meet him here as soon
as they conveniently could.

Early next week a joint session of
the Mexican-American commission
will be held at which the Americans
Will give the - Mexicans their answer
and on its nature depends the future
course of the commissioners, who are
directed more than four months ago to
effect if possible the adjustment of
questions at issue between the two
countries.
Character of Note Not Revealed.
Neither Mr. Cabrera nor Secretary
Lane would discuss the iiature of
Carranza'a reply. Mr. Cabrera left
for New York soon after its delivery
and Secretary Lane decline'd to reveal,
its character until it had been sub -mitted
to his colleagues. The same
reticence was. displayed at the Mex
ican embassy.
No Insuperable Barrier
It was learned that the Mexican
cofmissidncrs were confident that no
in8u perarole barrier had been raised
by Carranea. It -warn asserted that ths
utmost care had been exercised to
keep out of the reply any expressions
or sentiments . that might make the
situation more complex or that would
in any way offend the representatives
of the American government:.
Wants Troops Withdrawn Uncondi
tionally.
The .chief insistence of Carranza
has been that the American troops
should be withdrawn unconditionally
which the American commissioners
would not consider. It was indicated
tonight that Carranza's insistence on
that . point .was less pronounced now
and that the change . in his attitude
had been wrought largely by the al
tered . military Situation m northern
Mexico. -
Reactionaries a Real Menace.
An interesting development in the
Mexican situation generally was pre
sented today in reports to the state
and war departments on the changing
conditions in Mexico. - When the com
missioners adjourned at Atlantic City
there were few administration offi
cials who believed that Carranza's
power was seriously menaced. Since
then official reports have shown a
strength in the different reactionary
groups that now is recognized as dan
gerous. DETAILS OF SINKING OF
STEAMER WESTMINSTER.
British Admiralty Cites It as a Ruth
less Disregard of International Laws.
London. Dec. 28. 8.15 p. m. The ad
miralty has given to The Associated
Press the rollowmg statement con
cerning the sinking of the British
steamer Westminster, which was re
ported lost on Dec. 18:
"The degree of savagery the Ger
mans have attained in their submarine
policy appears to have reached a cli
max in the sinking of the Westminster,
which was proceeding from Torre An
nunziata to Port Said in ballast. On
Dec. 14. when 180 miles from the near
est land, the Westminster was attack
ed by a German submarine without
warning and was struck by two torpe
does in quick succession which killed
four men. The Westminster 6ank in
four minutes. '
"This ruthless disregard for the rules
of international law was followed by
a deliberate attempt to murder the
survivors.. The officers and crew while
effecting - their escape in boats were
shelfed by the submarine at a range j
of 3,000 yards. The master and chief
engineer -were killed outright. Their
boat was eunk. The second and third
engineers were not picked up; it is
presumed they were drowned-
"The captain of the submarine, must
have satisfied himself of the effective
ness of his two torpedoes, yet he pro
ceeded to carry out in cold .blood an
act of murder which could not possi
bly be Justified by any urgency of
war and can only jbe regarded in the.
eyes of the world as a further proof
of the degradation of German honor
and morale."
