United States Senators Cat

Hernandez writes from VVavh
ingtou to the effect that the
bureaU tf plant industry of tlie
government has for diStrib'utldn
packages of the following seeds:
80 four-pound packages of
Kansas grown alfalfa seed; 100
f. uf-potind packages of feterita
seed, 70 f 1 ur-pound packages of
begun sed. loO four-pound
package. of dwarf white milo
seed; 200 one-pound packages
of Sudan grass seed. These
servants advisw that thev
will b. glad tel iHRke tllstribu
tion of these seeds to anyone
making a call off them until
the supply is exausted. Each
package of the seed contains a
sufficient quantity for a Batis
factory field test. As the Quan
tity is very small, no individual
will f eceive more than on
package of one variety.
Eeiijise Scheduled Foi
The Year of i$H
Washington. D. C Seven
eclipses four of Him snn and
three of Hie' moon, will cause
the astronomical observers to

and northern Africa, but not to
Ainuiica.
On June 19 there will bo an.
other partial eciipse of the sun,
also invisible to North America.
Should astronomers desire to

It will Hot be a part of the IiuIh

Anne's desire for independence mo

she responded gravely, "and I have
learned some things also, today

So when I saw every one preparing
