EDITOR'S OBSERVATIONS.
Wealthiest Colored Man in Iowa.
This will be the last observation
that I shall write this collection year.
We first stopped at Folager, a mining
camp of a few hundred people. The
colored miners are doing well.
We next visited Buxton, Iowa, which
is the king of mining camps in Iowa
and perhaps the country. Until re
cently it has been the mecca for the
colored miners. However, in the last
few years, since Mr. Buxton has left,
several hundreds and perhaps thou
sands of miners have left and many
of their places taken by white miners.
It seems to be the policy of the new
superintendent to supplant many of
the colored miners with white. How
ever, Buxton is not what it once was,
nor will it ever be. I think last year
in my observations I stated that one
third of the 1,000 company houses
were vacant. This ye&r fully one-half
are vacant. It tells the story in brief.
The cause I am unable to state. And
those who are here are not working
on full time. Therefore the great
mining and commercial interest of
Buxton has constantly decreased,
and added to that the many fires that
have recently occurred makes Buxton
look like a deserted village. I think I
might state that Buxton has had fires
amounting to $10,000 worth of dam
age. Covering most of the colored
people who were in business and all
the residences belonging to colored,
and in nearly every case the fire was
a total destruction to whatever burn
ed, for there was no water protection.
We mentioned several months ago of
the burning of Coopertown, which
was a part of Buxton, where perhaps
one-half dozen stores, business houses
and the only hotel was burned, and
but few of those houses will ever be
rebuilt. Many of these business men
have gone elsewhere. Some have
gone in business in Des Moines, Cedar
Rapids, Chicago, Kansas City, Mil
waukee and Detroit, and still more
are planning to leave soon. Those
who. are still in busniess are J. Lucas
& Sons, who run a large bakery Lon
don iBros., second hand store Mr.
Roberts, blacksmith shop. There are
three barber shops. Mr.Hobe Arm
strong still operates the meat shop.
He is reputed as being the wealthiest
man in Monroe county, either white
or colored. He, owns 12,000 acres of
land and the county treasurer inform
ed ye .editor that some of his land
was the highest assessable land in the
county. No other land was assessed
as high as some of his. Atty. Geo. H.
Woodson still lives here, although he
is
speftding
Hi vacation jn New Mexi­
co, taking a "much needed rest. He
owns several pieces of property here
and lost one of his fine houses in one
of the recent fires. Dr. Carter and Dr.
Robinson attend to the sick. They
are splendid doctors and are doing
welj. Dr. Willis is the dentist and has
a good trade. He has added one more
to his family and some day will be
of great help to him in his work.
There are several colored miners who
own small farms and are doing nicely.
Among them are Messrs. Bates, Chat
man, Tate, Armstrong, Reuben Gains,
one of the wealthiest men of the
camp, Harvey, H. H. Harris and
Johnson. The schools are taught by
mixed teachers. The colored teachers
are Mrs. W. H. London, principal
MIBS Findley of Oskaloosa, Georgia
Blackburn of Des Moines, Gertrude
Lucas of Bedford, Iowa, Grace Harris
of Mt. Pleasant and Lulu Hart of
Muscatine. Mr. Ed Mills is the sec
retary of the Y. M. C. A., a young
man who was raised and educated in
Buxton and has a bright future be
fore/him. The Y. M. C. A. is progress
ing under his management and is as
sisted by Mr. Potter. We wish for
these young menf)uccess. The band is
moving along as well as cculd be ex-
pected under the superintendency ot
Mr. Oliver. They have the
THE
finest
col­
ored musical organization in the stae

ligious life is 'keeping pace with
