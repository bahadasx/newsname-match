STATE PRESS OPINION
FOR THE FUN OF THE THING
From the -St. Louis Ilepubllc:
. The Times is attacking the State
University apparently purely for the
fan of the thing. We make this guess
'because a serious attack usually pays
tome little attention to such matters
ia present facts and past history.
' We are not referring to such things
u tre matters of opinion merely. For
.-tumnle:
"Oar light-hearted cpntemporcry is
longing for someone at the university
Trith Influence sufficient to induce the
.Legislature to spend money enough to
mpply necessary buildings and equip
ment Without taking up the highly
Interesting question of just what a
University President is elected for. It
it sufficient to mention the fact that
under President Hill more money has
been spent for buildings at Columbia
than in the entire history of the Uni
versity previous to his coming. It is
also interesting to note that the old
luildlngs arc kept in excellent repair,
while the new ones are fireproof.
Our esteemed contemporary docs
not care anything about the Univer
tlty.or the relation of the people to
ward it, or the reputation of the State,
or the efficiency of the University
leadership. We know it does not. be
cause a newspaper that cared about
these things would take the trouble to
find out things before it communicat
ed them to its readers. Wa see no
special harm likely to result from our
contemporary's tactics, so long as
their essential frivolousncss is kept
Wor the public mind. The friend
cfthe Unhcrsity or enemy, for that
matter who expects to find out any
thing from-this "expose" is a guile
less and surc-to-bc-disappointed per
Mn. And we should like to say in a
friendly way to a newspaper which" al
ys inquires on which side the heav
iest battalions arc ranged before It
declares itself, that attacking the Uni
versity is a game that is played out
In Missouri and that other kinds of di
version are cheaper and more filling
t the price.

New Letter Gives No Hope
For Immediate , Return
of Company F.
At present there is no hope for the
immediate return of Company F,
Fourth Missouri Infantry, -according
to a letter received by Prof. L. M. De
foe, president of the .Commercial .Club.
The JetUir-ls-troinTthe adjutant ..gen
eral, written to and forwarded by Sen
ator William J. Stone. It is as fol
lows: "My dear Senator; Referring to your
letter of December IS, inclosing a let
ter from the Commercial Club of Co
lumbia. Mo., urging the return home
from the Mexican border of Company
F, Fourth Missouri Infantry, the Sec
retary of War desires me to inform
you that as long as the service of the
National Guard on the border is neces
sary, it is not possible to state, at! this
time, as to when any particular organ
ization can be returned home for mus
ter out.
''From time to time it is fbund pos
sible to withdraw portions of the Na
tional Guard, and recently a number
of organizations were designated for
return, but it does not appear that the
organization referred to in the letter
of the Commercial Club of Columbia is
among the number.
"When, however, it does become pos
sible to withdraw any portion of the
National Guard, the selection of the
units to be so withdrawn is left to the
department commander, who is on
the ground, and who knows best which
troops should be returned. The War
Department would not be In position
to make such a judgment.
"In view of the foregoing it is re
gretted that it cannot be stated at this
time with any degree of certainty as
to when Company F, Fourth Missouri
Infantry, will be returned to its home
station for muster out"

FREE MEDICAL CLINIC
Will Be Attached to Parker
Memorial Hospital To
Open Jan. 1.
NOT FOR STUDENTS
University Health Depart
ment Not Connected With
New Service.
Columbia is soon to hae a Tree
clinic In general medicine and sur
gery. The Board of Curators of tl e
University at its last meeting authu -
rized the establishment of the clinic,
at the Parker Memorial Hospital, adj
1 arrangemenU are almost completed
ifor Its beginning January 1. journal published at Shanghai, China.
The nurnosc of the clinic is to give. Mr. Powell is the eighth Missouri
adequate practical training to second
year medical students In physical di
agnosis and minor surgery. This will
be done by lectures and demonstration j
of the treatment of patients in the
clinic. It will Indirectly be a great
help to persons in Columbia who arc
unable to pay for medical or surgical
treatment A dollar a day will be
charged for hospital care, but the at
tention of doctors in both medical and
surgical cases will be free. No spe
cial rooms will be set aside for clini
cal patients, although they will prob
ably be mostly ward patients.
"There should be no fear that be
cause the clinic Is establisshed for the
benefit of the students, the best treat
ment will not be given," said Dr. Guy
L. Noycs, acting dean of the School
of Medicine. "It will usually be
found to work out in the opposite way.
Uncommonly good treatment is given
to clinical patients because the doctor
is working as an example to the-students
and thus takes unusual care."
This ia not the first time a free clinic

When tht four-year course wa3 given
in the School, from 1900 to 1910, there
was also a free clinic, which was later
abolished with the last two years of
medicine. The establishment of the
clinic now is not, however, a re-establishment
of the old clinic, and no at
tempt is being made to refound the
old four-year course. According to
Doctor Noyce, conditions in a town the,
size of Columbia do not permit a satis-'
factory course in the last two years of j
medicine.
The enrollment in the School of
Medicine this year is seventy-three, an
increase of forty-four since 1910.
The staff of the clinic will be: Medi-
cine. Dr. Woodson Moss and Dr. Dan
G. Stine; surgery and obstetrics. Dr.
Max W. Myer; eye, nose and throat,
Dr. Guy L. Noyes; anesthesia, Dr. A.
W. Kamnschmidt: nathology. Dr. D.'
H. Dolley; bacteriology. Dr. M. P.
Ravenel; electrology and photography, '
Prof. H. C. Rentschler. -
The clinic will be open to every one
except students. It is in no way con
nected with the student health serv
