"So LongLetty"IsTo
Be Here Next Week
Famous Ingersoll Company Booked
For Two Performances At Weller
And Vasconcellos Houses
The Ingersoll Comedy Company,
which has been delighting Honolulu
theater goers for some weeks, will be
on Maui next week, according to in
formation received this morning by
Manager Pharos. Two performances
are scheduled. "So Long Letty," will
be given at the Wailuku Orpheum on
Thursday evening, January 4th, and
annthpr T 1 1 1 1 will lio crlvon nn Vrrnv
night at the Kahuiui Lyceum. TheFift icth An liversary Of Church Build-
louowmg is wnai ine Aavertiser nas
to say about a recent performance of
the company:
"So Long, Letty," the performance
of which was staged last night at the
Dijou, is putting an unusual ending to
the season of the Ingersoll Comedy
Company at the playhouse. It has
already sold out four houses, and bids
fair to do so again tonight, with the
possibility that, if It does, it will be
continued for a week. "So Long,
Letty," is far ahead of everything else
the Ingersoll people attempted during
their engagement here.
Constant applause interrupted the
performance last night, and the four
principals deserved all they got.
Frank Vack never did anything better,
nor did Pearl Jardiniere, who at last
has a real part and Is showing that
she is a good deal more than a funny
interpolation, and does the best work
of the season here. Jeanne Mai and
Kek Schilling are the other members
of the quartet whose romance has
been so comically displayed, and they
are just as good. The music Is tune
ful, catchy and well sung.
These four arc practically all of
"So Long, Letty," and no more are
needed. In spite of the fact this show
runs forty-five minutes longer than
the company's productions in the
past, there isn't a slow minute In it,
nor is there a minute when the situa
tion is not becoming funnier than it
was the minute previous. As a clever
comedy with few plays produced in
the past few seasons to equal it, and
Ingersoll players are doing it full
justice. Adv.

Bullet Through Wall
Kills Sleeping Baby
Peculiar Tragedy During Christmas
Celebration At Hamakuapoko Camp
Man Held On Suspicions
Struck by a bullet fired by an un
known band, Flora, the little three
ami n half year old daughter of Mr.
nnd Mrs. John Oouveia, of Hamakua,
without hr.ving recovered conscious
ness. The shooting occurred on Sun
day afternoon about 4:30 o'clock, the
balling coming through the wnll of
the room in which the child was lying
asleep on a bed. The missile, which
was probably from a 32 calibre revol
ver, entered the baby's head Just
above the ear, and lodged in the brain
near the base of the skull.
A Torto Riean named Fernandez
Planesi. who lived in the camp about
160 feet from the Gouveia home, Is
being held by the police on suspicious
of having fired the shot, though he
denies vigorously that he even owns
a firearm. There is no doubt that the
shot was a random one, since no one
firing at the house, even intentionally,
could have had any idea of hitting
anyone within.
A bullet-pierced banana leaf outside
the Gouveia residence enabled Sheriff
Crowell, who investigated the case,
to determine the direction in which
the shot was fired, and this indicates
that it came from a window of the
house occupied by Planesi. At the
time of the shooting a party of Porto
Rican merry-makers were playing and
singing near the corner of Planesl's
house, but according to the course the
bullet must have taken, they were at
too low an elevation for it to have
come from them.
The case is a peculiarly sad one.
The mother of the dead child was in
another part of the house when one
of her other children ran in saying
that the baby had bloody on its face.
The cries of the frantic mother
brought a crowd of neighbors, but it
was some time before the excited
community could appreciate how the
child had been shot. The fact that
firecrackers were being fired all
through the camp, in celebration of
Christmas, explains why the revolver
shot seems not to have been noticed
by anyone.
Planesi today confessed to Sheriff
Crowell thit he fired the shot. He
was simply celebrating, he said.
Church Of Good
- Stephen! Jubilee
ing In Wailuku To Be Celebrated

On Christmas day of fifty years
ago, that is, in tno year iuo, me
congregation of the Church or tne
Good Shepl erd worshiped for the first

18G6, the congregation had worshiped
under the pastoral leadership of the
Rev. Geor.jo Whipple, in a school
house which stood opposite to the
present Maui hotel, on the site now
occupied by The Maui News and, by
what may Be called "Lawyers' Row."

Christmas Service At
Wailuku Union Church
At the Wailuku Union Church last
Sunday ev ning, an unusually beauti
ful Christmas service wbb held, in
spite of the very bad weather large
audience gathered. Mlns Mary E.
Hoffmann played old Christmas carols
for the organ recital before the serv
ice. Familiar Christmas hymns were
sung ty tne congregation, wnu
special choir under the direction ot
Mrs. L. C. Jones heautiiuuy renuereu
"While Shepherds Watched their
Flocks by Night" and "Now the Sun
has Sunk to Rest." Mrs. Jones sang
as a solo Adams' "Holy Night." The
senium by Rev. Mr. Dodge the min
ister of the church, was upon the
topic "Casting out JVar," which was
listened by most attentively.
Some seventy-five enormous sprays

Booze Party-Burned
House-Two Dead
HanallasTragedyFollowingProlonged
Christmas Celebration Fire May
Have Been Incendiarv Origin
Late development that Punihale
was murdered and the house burned
to hide the crime. Hu was placed
under arrest today. Witnesses have
testified that durnlng the drunken'row
Hu struck Punihale with a lantern
and then with a heavy bowl, knock
ing him unconscious. The police be
lieve that Hu later set fire to the
bouse believing the limn dead! It Is
supposed that he forgot the presence
of his own son, who was burned so
badly that he died later.
As a climax to almost a week of
Christmas celebration in which booze
played a prominent part, Joseph Pu
nihale, of Hana, was burned to a cind
er, Joseph Hu, a ten-year old boy was
so badly burned that he died later,
while a murder charge may be lodged
against one or more Hana residents.
The tragedy occured near midnight
on Wednesday, when the small house
of George Hu, near the county stables
in Hana, was burned to the ground.
Punihale, who was asleep in the build-
l ing was incinerated, Hu made his
escape uninjured, but can tell little
about the matter, and his young son
who escaped by jumping through a
w-'ndow with his clothing in a blaze,
was bo badly injured that he died
about one o'clock yesterday afternoon.
Earlier in the eveing the place had
been crowded with revelers who had
been hanging about the place and
drinking since Christmas. The party
broke up about eleven o'clock on ac
count of a row which started, in
which Punihale is said to have had a
prominent part. All of the crowd left
except Hu and his son and Punihale,
who went to bed.
How the house caught fire is not
known, though from the fact of the
fight, the police are not certain that
it may not have been the worlr of an
incendiary. Sheriff Crowell left this
morning for Hana where he expects to
hold an inquest at which the matter
will be thoroughly investigated.
Puuihale was a luna on the Kaeleku
Sugar Company's plantation. He is
survived by a wife- and three
children. The dead boy was not
thought at first to be badly burned,
but is supposed to have inhaled the
flames through which he ran in escap
ing from the house.

ergarten Committee held this week at
the Haldwin National Hank. Miys

gaged to be the successor ot Miss
A. R. Swain, who came in September
to take up the work oi the kindergar
ten, but who taught for only five
weeks. Miss Hannah has " been the
house guest of Mr. John Guild of
Honolulu, and has a wide circle of
friends in the city. She comes with
the very highest recommendations to
take up the position in Kahului. She
will occupy the cottage in the parson
age yard, and will probably board with
Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Pleasant.
There were a largo number of ap
plicants for the Kahului position. The
Committee felt, that In Miss Hannah
nil unusual opportunity was presented
in view of the fact she is a train
ed kindergartner who had taken
special work under Miss Frances
Lawrence and has had a great deal
of practical experience in actual
practice work n Honolulu.
Miss Hannat is expected to begin
her work immediately when the new
term begin in January. The school
