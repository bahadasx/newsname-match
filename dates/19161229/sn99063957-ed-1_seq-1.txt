Buenos AireH, Dec. 29. ticnmul as
touishmciit was aroused here today
over news that the United States is
cnusiderating adoption ol u military
service plan based on that in force in
Argentine. The public astonishment is
based on the bitter criticisms whieh
have been levelled at operation of the
plan la this republie.
Press comment reflects the inabili
ty of citizens of Argentine to under
stand America's consideration of such
a service plan. One typical editorial
tmlay wagered that less than one per
cent of American citizens understand
the system "otherwise,"' it continued
"they would not want its favoritism in
conscriptions, due to 'influence' or
neatly placed tips a situation bound
to occur in such a system.''.

year in the army and two years in the
navy. For the eriod after completing
the term of training in the army or
uavv until reaching his thirtieth year,
the Argentine soldier remains a "reg
ular, " but is not in harness. He must
practice shooting, there being a pre
scribed minimum per year, and he is
liable to be called on to attend man
euvers. After 30 the regular passes again
into the national guard and ceases to
be under orders and expense of the fed
eral government, booming entirely a
servant of his state. These men can
not be called on by the federal gov
ernment for any reason until all the
men between 20 and 30 have been call
ed. In the public schools boys enter drill
ing classes at 12 and at 15 begin train
ing in markmanship. Officers for the
regulars are supplied fioni the military
school, similar to the American West
Point. They are taught for four years
and join the army as sublieutenants.
Exemptions from the plan are made
fo.. illness and physicr.il defects, as

men with brothers or sisters dependent

Fear Expressed That "Un

May Ensue
By J. P. Yoder.
(United Press staff correspondent )
Washington, Dec. 29 If Uermany de
sires that the United states pass along
any secret pence terms for the entente
allies to consider at a rount table ses-
:0U) tnis government will lend itself to
mat work:
A high state department official said
today, but qualified his remarks by em
phasiziiig that the United States would
be acting "merely as a messenger."
"Acting iu such capacity," tins ot
ficial said, "would be no impropriety."
It was suggested to him that Gcr
many is apparently trying to maneuver
the united States into furthering such
a secret peace conference as Germany
avowedly and assiduously is working
for.
''Would the I'nited States act public
ly and lay its cards on the table in such
a casef" he was asked,
"I don't think we would have any
cards to lav on the table," he answer
ed. Another official of the department,
when questioned on this point, declared
mat where tins go ',.imnut acts as
"the messenger" for one side or the
other, any communications which it
handles between the belligerents must
bo kept secret if the power transmit
ting such a communication requests this
government to keep it a secret.
The idea of a break with Germany
over submarine warfare, if the pence
proposals fall flat, is now generally held
here.
Some administration men say private
ly the German peace answer is insincere.
They sec little hope, if nny, of the al
lies meeting the German proposals. They
fear "an unbridled submarine war
fare" will follow failure of present
peace negotiations.
Those officials who have talked with
the British ambassador, Sir Cecil Spring
Rice, say the allies never will consent
to what appears to be Germany's pres
ent chief objective, namely, the calling
of a conference, before specific pence
terms are publicly announced.
There were interpreters of the admin
istration's actions who today held the
belief that talk of a break with Ger
many over submarine warfare should
peace proposals fall flat, is another
"home made crisis," put forth with i
view of influencing Germany-
Meantime, there is talk among con
gressmen that affairs have been bun
gled; that secret diplomacy is being
tried. And this talk is not confined to
Capitol Hill.

TODAY'S WAR MOVES
Teutonic forces are still successfully
battering their way northward in Ru
mania and Dobrudia and iu addition
have apparently begun an offensive di
rected eastward on the 1 ransy Ivnnia
front, according to today's battle re
ports.
The vigor ot tins great series ot op
erations in the east was reported in ad
dition to a sudden offensive on the
western front, reported by both the
French and German statements as hav
ing caused fierce fighting in the neigh
borhood of Bloody Hill 301, and Dead
Mail's hill.
The German statement indicates the
fighting reported is mostly on the two
wings In Rumania indicating a con
tinuation of the flanking tactics which
the Germans have found so successful in
their whole eastern campaign.
Berlin reported in the oast the cap
ture of 2,800 Russian prisoners.
Petrogrnd's version indicates a Ger
man offensive in "the Carpathians

repulse of attacks there. A few miles
south of this point, on the Kasiuo (Cas

the town was abandoned.
Groat steel plants have developed

SECRET DIPLOMACY

Washington, Dec. 29. Three United
States senators today denounced the re
cent handling of this country's inter

diplomacy. They declared that not only
have recent matters been hedged about
with secrecy as far as the public is con
cerned but that even the snate foreign
relations committee has not been given
opportunity to know "what is going

constitutional powers of the presidnt
to set aside the Monroe doctrine, for in

or agree to do so; or to commit tho
country to that policy without the ad
vice and consent of the senate.
"What is more important is that
these great movements are taken with
out the advice and consent of public
opinion, which is supposed to be the
governing factor in a detnocfacy such ns
this.
"It is far better that secret diplom
