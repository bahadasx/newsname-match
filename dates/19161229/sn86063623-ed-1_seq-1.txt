Basket Ball Team's Uni
forms. "After the Game," a 45 minute'
playlet of college life, was pres
ented at the Grand Thursday
by ten of the students of Lexing
ton High School. It was given
in three acts and. laid in two
scenes. The cast comprised two
girls from each of the four
classes of the High School. They
were characterized locally as fol
lows: the Seniors, Misses Eliza
beth Ashurst and Helen Hines-
ley; Juniors, Misses Bonnie Day
and Elzabeth Farrell ; the Sophs,
Misses Dolly Maude Davis and
Pattie Blee; and the freshmen
were Misses Mildred Cole and
Esther Stalling. Miss Eupha
Neer had the part of a maid and
drew a big laugh at her explana
tion of the football game.
The first act was a discussion
of the woes of college life, the
football coach and the football
team. The second act saw the
leading lady and one of the sen
iors, Miss Ashurst, very ill and
unable to attend the last football
game of the season. She was
told later of thesteam winning
and also told that, the boy she
loved was the real hera of the
battle, and had suffered a broken
leg in the game.
The final scene is laid in Jack
Morton's room, who was the
hero and the halfback on the
Varsity team. This part was
played by Joe J. Carter. Mr.
Carter proved a real hero, and,
although- Buffering from the in
jury of a broken leg and seat
ed in an invalid's chair, display
ed, with M,iss Ashurst, some
fine dramatic ability in the clos
ing minutes of the play.

exceptionally well and were giv
