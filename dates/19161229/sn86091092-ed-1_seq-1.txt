government guarantee of
bonds will stimulate
greatest activity in
reclamation of arid
and swamp
lands.
Country Has 25,000,000 Acres of Arid
Land and 75,000,000 of Swamp Land
to Be Utilized—Money is Available
if Guaranteed—Smith Proposes to
' Make the Money Come—Would
Help Remainder of the Black
Canyon.
In the last issue of The Tribune
was printed a brief outline of a bill
introduced by Congressman Addison
T. Smith which provides for govern
ment aid for irrigation districts ir
floating their bonds. More definite in
formation of the scopc of the reclama
tion work which would be opened up
is given in the following Washington
special to The Tribune.
Arid and Swamp Lands.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 28.—If the
bill recently introduced in the house
by Congressman Smith of Idaho
should become a law it would be an
easy matter to secure capital to re
claim the arid lands of the west and
the swamp lands of the south.
Under the provisions of the measure
it is proposed to authorize the issuance
of bonds upon irrigation and drainage
districts organized under state laws,
which are to be deposited with the
Secretary of the Treasury; the interest
on the bonds to be secured by a fund
to be accumulated in the Treasury at
the rate of $500.000 per annum from
the proceeds of the sale of public
lands. The bonds are to bear not
more than four per cent interest. With
the guarantee of the government be
hind the bonds, it is believed that they
will be easily marketed.
The bill also provided that the un
entered public lands within the district
to be irrigated or drained shal^be di
vided into farm units of such area as in
the opinion of the Secretary of the
Interior may be reasonably required
for the support of a family, and not
more than one farm unit shall be sold
to the same person, which arc to be
sold at public auction to the highest
bidder at not less than the appraised
value.
It is also provided that one-fourth
of the land shall be irrigated or re
claimed by drainage within three
years, three-eighths within four years
and one-half within five years after
the projects are completed.
Millions of Acres.
There are about 25,000,000 acres of
arid land for the irrigation of which
sufficient water could be stored in
reservoirs, and there are about 75,
000,000 acres of swamp land in the
United States which, according to en
gineers' reports could be reclaimed.
Under the provisions of the proposed
law it is believed that capital could
easily be secured to reclaim the Bru
neau tract in Idaho consisting of 500,
000 acres, the Minidoka extension con
sisting of 150,000 acres, the Black Can
yon consisting of 8J),000 acres, and
numerous similar projects.
Congressman Smith has submitted
copy of his bill to each of the mem
bers of congress from the arid land
states and thei southern states, in
which are situated the swamp lands,
with the hope of securing their active
co-operation toward the enactment of
the proposed legislation.
Mr. Smith contends that at the close
of the European war there will be
necessarily a curtailment of activity
in the manufacturing lines, and that
there will be hundreds of thousands
of men thrown out of employment for
whom provision must be made in the
way of a livelihood, and that with the
immense quantity of money in the
banks and trust companies throughout
the country, and the high price of food
products, it will be an easy matter to
dispose of the lands to bona fide set
tlers as rapidly as they can be re
claimed under the proposed legisla
tion.
Holiday Party.
Miss Martha Rice was hostess at a
charming party at her home on the
Boulevard last Friday evening. I he
spacious living room, library and
(lining room were pretty with festoons
in red and green, red carnations ac
centuating the holiday note, and a
gay little Christmas tree electrically
lighted and laden with suggestive
packages, completed the story of the
season in decorations. A score ot
young people enjoyed the games and
music and each was the recipient ot a
gift from the tree. At the close ot
the festivities, a buffet lunch was
served, in which the Xmas color
scheme was again reflected.

The Reclamation Service has recom
mended that a part of the Black Can

from the Boise project are to be used
for the purpose. It is proposed to
reclaim about 40;(XX) acres.
The plans also propose furnishing
water for an additional 60,000 acres of
land in the Boise Valley. The present
plans will utilize surplus water on the
Boise project and materially reduce
the cost.
Letter From Commission.
The following letter from the Rec
lamation Commission sets forth in de
tail the plans of the Reclamation Ser
vice. It follows:
December 18, 1916.
The Secretary, Boise Water Users'
Association, Boise, Idaho.
Dear Sir:
1. For some time it has been evi
dent that there is sufficient water
available in the Boise river to irrigate
more land than there is under the
present canals of the project.
2. The present Boise project con
tains approximately 143,000 acres
divided as follows:
Acres
Upper division 90,104
Deerflat 52,872
142,976
Studies of the project water supply
have recently been brought up to date
which show that 50,000 additional
acres could have been given a com
plete water supplv without producing
any material shortage in more than
two out of the twenty-two years of the
past river flow record.
3. In view of this situation, surveys
and estimates have been made for var
ious areas in and adjacent to the Boise
project in order to obtain sufficient
data to determine which, of any, of
these additional areas can be brought
into the Boise project. The results of
the surveys, field examination and of
fice studies of the Boise project
officials may be summarized as fol
lows: . ..

4. No detailed studies of cost were
prepared for items (c) and (e) in the
above table as the distance of the
lands from source of supply, together
with the necessity for pumping for
which no power supply is at present
available, made it evident that the cost

The information following is briefed
from the board report and is sent for
vour information.
7 The cost of new construction per
acre must have an important bearing
o„ thc selection for first construction
of an> additional unit in ease money
for project extensions should become
available. This acre cost of new con
j structron, however, is not entirely con
. elusive as regards the feasibility
leach addition as the actual cost
these units involves not only the cost
' of new construction but also the pro
j portionate cost of structures already
i built which must be utilized,
j 8. In general, the soil of the prv>
I posed units is very similar to that
the present project and the extensions
! are about equally as well located
regards accessibility to towns, rail
roads, etc., so it is believed it would
advisable to have the areas in tlie pro
posed extensions, if built, bear the
same construction charge as the pres
ent project.
9. A considerable area in the proj
ect is not as yet pledged to pay
share of the cost, but there has been
the past a gradual diminuation of this
unpledged area, and it is probable that
] this area will ultimately become some
what reduced or to possibly half what
it is now. Unless the entire area can
be brought into the project, the com
mission would not consider it safe to
recommend to the secretary of the
interior that he fix a construction
charge less than $80 per irrigable
acre.
10. The best and probably the only
method of dealing effectively with this
unpledged land situation is to require
land owners to form the present proj
ect area into an irrigation district.
Such requirement is reasonable and is
in many other respects advantageous
t > the water users. Until it is com
plied with, it seems also advisable to
cease so far as feasible fuarther expen
diture for lateral construction and
drainage which are included in the cost
features for present project areas.
11. It is believed that a fair margin
will be provided if the Reclamation
Commission should recommend to the I
secretary of the interior that if a con
tract can be entered into requiring
each irrigable acre to pay its share of
the cost, the construction charge be
fixed at $70 per irrigable acre.
12. The commission, therefore, pro
poses to recommend to the secretary
of the interior that the public notice
should fix the construction charge for
the present project lands at $80 per
irrigable acre, with a proviso that this
charge be reduced to $70 if within two
years from the date of such public
notice an Irrigation District be formed
covering the present project lands and
if within said time such district enter
into a suitable contract with the gov
ernment and the land owners in the
proposed additions listed in Table A,
with the exception of items (c) and
(e), Dry Lake Pumping, guarantee re
payment by means of district organi
zations and appropriate contracts.
13. Selection of any one unit or
sub-unit for earliest consideration for
extension of the project must.depend
on many considerations, human as
well as financial. In this connection,
various delegations have appeared be
fore the board above referred to, as
follows:
Landowners under Hillcrest, who
pointed out the advantage of the vicin
ity of their tract to Boise and argued
that until lands which can only be
supplied from the Boise river arc taken
care of, no water from the Arrowrock
reserviôr should be definitely assigned
to lands on the north side of the
impossible
river, which it is physically impossible
to supply from the Payette river.
Landowners under Dry Lake tract,
who presented a similar argument as
to use of Boise water.
• Commercial Club of Boise, who ar
gued largely to the same effect.
Landowners under the North Side
Project, and within the Black Canyon
Irrigation District, who called atten
tion to a resolution passed by the
non iu a • cnuiuiiwii w . /
Reclamation Commission on March 0, i
1916, and who explained the early his-1
/torv of thc Payette-Boise Project

Deer Fla; Resident Answers Summons
T. II. McCullough, one of the best
l ived and most highly respected resi
ients of Deer Flat, answered the sum
mons of the Grim Reaper Tuesday
night following a brief attack of pneu
monia. The deceased was born in In
diana 71 years ago. He came west in
1900, locating near North Yakima, but
purchased a farm six miles southwest
of the city and has made that his home
for tin- past five years, during which
time he made many friends because of
kindliness and his many lovable quali
ties. Besides his wife, he leaves one
son, Orris McCuddough, and a daugh
ter, Mrs. Celia Greenfield, both of
whom reside on farms near their
father's home.
The funeral service was held from
the Christian church of which he has
been a life-long member. The service
was conducted by Rev. B. W. Rice,
pastor of the Huston church, in which
Mr. McCullough has been an active
worker since its organization. The
large crowd at the funeral in itself
was an attestation of the esteem in
which he was held. The remains were
shipped on the noil train to his old
home in Medoryville, Ind., accom
panied by his wife, his son and his
daughter.
New Undertaking Establishment.
The undertaking parlors added to
the furniture firm of F'aris & Holgate
were opened to the public this week,
the dedicatory service being for Mr.
Porter on Wednesday afternoon.
The chapel is up-to-date in every
particular and artistically as well as
conveniently arranged. It is richly
carpeted in brown, to harmonize with
the hangings. The walls are tinted a
soft tan, the ceiling is cream color and
the wood-work is of fir, the heavy
pillars which flank the recessed pulpit
lending dignity to the arrangement.
To the left of the pulpit is an invisible
choir loft and on the right is a private
nook for relatives and close friends,
while the main auditorium insures
comforable seating room for a fair
sized audience.
