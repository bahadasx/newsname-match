NUMBER 52
Permanent Roads for Latah
At a largely attended noon lunch
eon at Moscow Tuesday, under the
auspices of the chamber of com
merce the subject of good roads
was discussed in many of its phases.
F. S. Randall of Lewiston, senator
elect from Nez Perce county, spoke
of the work Nez Perce county and
the counties across the river in
Washington have been doing in the
building of main thoroughfares,
and he urged Latah county to take
up the work at the county line and
carry it forward. He condemned
haphazard methods of spending
large sums on the roads year after
year, with nothing to show for the
money spent, and urged the build
ing of substantial roads through
bond issues.
Charles Munson, a prominent La
tah county farmer, said when he
first went to Boise years ago as a
member of the legislature • every
member from Latah countv was
spotted because he wore rubbers,
and in that wav the county got the
reputation of being the muddiest
county in the state. He said it
was high time to quit making mud
pies. He urged the abolition of
overseers, the creation of highway
districts and the appointment of
three trustees for each district to
serve without pay as school trus
tees serve.
Dean Little, head of the engi
neering department of the Univer
sity of Idaho, said the cost of the
roads must be paid either in bonds
or djrect taxes. He urged ex
treme care in the decision as to the
kind of road and the cost. This
work, he said, required the best in
telligence available. It is work for
well trained men only. He urged
that a representative of the United
States be brought in to build roads
with Latah county material as an
experiment.

Normal Defeats K. H. S.
The Kendrick high School basket
ball team was defeated last Tues
day night in the local gymnasium
by the Lewiston normal team by
score of 3ß to 12. The normal
team was simply too last for the
high school team and out played
them all thru the game. The nor
mal coach played with the visiting
team and was one of the brst play
ers they had.
The lineup of the Kendrick team
was as follows : Davis and Waltz,
forwards; Clem, center; H. Meyers
and F. Meyers, guards; Mckeçver
and Flaig, substitutes.
The normals played Jordan and
Sartin, forwari s; Crum, center
Irwin and McDonald, guards.
H. B. Emmel refereed the game
^«nd his decisions were fair thruout
the game.
Check for Idaho Regiment
The 2nd Idaho regiment received
Christmas present in a check for
$5,000 presented by Timothy Regan
pioneer business man of Idaho, to
go toward paying off the troops the
money due them from the state
The check was voluntarily offered
hy Mr Regan. It was accepted by
Governor Alexander. The chief ex
ecutive added a second Christmas
gift in his personal check for $1500,
making a total of $6,500, which,
with the amount on hand to the
state's credit, will meet the total
obligation of $7,333.50.
This means that the regiment will
receive the other half of the pay
due its officers and enlisted men
prior to the time it was mustered
into the service of the United States.
The money now on hand may be
disbursed to the regiment during
the present week.
tin
The basketball game played last
Thursday night at the Kendrick
high school gymnasium was one of
e best that has been seen here for
long time. At the end of the
first half the score stood 9 to 12 in
favor of Kendrick. The score- at
the end of the game stood 21 to 24
in favor of the Lewiston boys. Fif
teen minute halves were played in
stead of the usual twenty minute
halves, as the Lewiston team had to
go back on the 9:05 o'clock train.
The Lewiston high school has a fast
team and the showing made by the
local team was nothing to be a
shamed of. The Kendrick boys are
light but they play a fast game.

Dairy Day at U. of I.
On Dairy Day of Farmers' Week
which will be held at Moscow dur
ing the fourth week in January
more emphasis than heretofore will
be placed on the possibilities of de-,
velopment of the cheese industry of
Idaho. We expect to have with us
Mr. Gustave Kuntze who has had
exceptional success as a dairyman
and cheese manufacturer in South
Idaho. Mr. Kuntze will discuss
the cheese situation in general and
marketing in particular. The rap
idly growing interest in our state
makes tnis topic a very timely one.
Mr. Kuntze will also discuss herd
management from the standpoint
of a practical dairyman.
The subject of silo construction
and kinds of ensilage will be dis
cussed by Mr. O. D. Canter, direct
or Agricultural Extension.
The organization of cow testing
associations will be handled by Mr.
W. E. Meyer. Mr. Meyer is at the
present time in federal employ in
charge of Cow Testing Association
Organization work in the west. Mr.
Kuntze will also be able to give
some valuable cow testing experi
ence, since he is president of the
Bui 1 Pioneer Cow Testing Associa
tion; one of the strongest associa
tions in the west.
The sanitary production and
handling of milk will be discussed
from a commonsense practical
standpoint by E. F. Goss, Assistant
Professor of Dairying at the Uni
versity of Idaho.—News Letter.

May-Grady
Miss Crystal May of Kendrick
and Earl Grady of Elk River were
married in Lewiston Wednesday
evening, December 27. Mrs. Grady
was a freshman in the Kendrick
high school this term and was pop
ular with the younger set here. Mr.
Grady is an engineer in the lumber
yards at the Elk River sawmill.
Training Corps at U. of I.
A reserved officers training corps
will be established at the Univer
sity of Idaho, and training given
university students which will fit
them for regular commissions in
the army should a national emer
gency necessitate their being called
upon, according to a telegram re
ceived by M. A. Brannon, president,
from Adjutant General McCain of
the war department.
This provision is made under the
special legislation of last July when
the federal reserve act was passed,
for the establishment in
educational institutions of training
corps for reserved officers under
federal supervision. Students who
take advantage of the opportunity
will receive in their freshman and,
sophomore years, free uniforms
from the government; and in their
last years they will receive special
to that
compensation equivalent . .....
given the soldiers in the army for
living expenses, or about $7 or $8
per month.
Capitol Correspondence
items of Interest at The Meeting of County Commissioners
Held at Boise.
_
The most important meeting held
in Boise in many days was the meet
ing last week of the Countv Com
missioners. It is true that the at
tendance was not so large as it
should have been but when we con
sider that these poorly paid officials
must travel and live at the leading
hotels at their ojvn expense the at
tendance is above what could rea
sonably be expected.
Your own County Commissioner,
John L. Woody, was on hand and
attended strictly to business. One
thing is sure that Latah county can
feel proud of its representative.
Having served the convention as its
chairman for the past two years it
was but natural that some other
county solon should claim the prize
of presiding officer so the reelec
tion of Mr. Woody for the ensuing
two years is not only a compliment
to the county but a distinct appre
ciation of the worth of the man.
For reasons that appear later
each county should be represented
at these annual gatherings and each
county should at least bear the act
ual expenses of one delegate. The
good that is accomplished through
these conferences cannot be esti
mated in dollars and cents but to
one who knows of their workings
a
and has come into close contact
with them, it is believed that such
services to the county are invalu
able. Then why not bear the ex
penses of such delegates.
Here we come into contact with
intelligent men who stand very
close to the people, in fact, it is the
people speaking through these men
more clearly than any other body of
men assembled fur any other pur
pose. Wavs and means are here
discussed for handling the counties
business with results that cannot be
attained in any other way.
The meeting of last week was es
pecially notable for the wide local
interest it attracted. Prominent
speakers were present to welcome
the delegates. The Commercial
Club, a live wire, tendered the use,
throughout the three days sessions,
of their commodious club rooms
and all united to honor the visitors.
The Governor spoke also.
The banquet at the Idanha Hotel
on Tuesday evening was one of the
pleasant social features. Ed Smith
presided as toast master. You all
know Ed, at least everybody in
Lewiston and Boise knows him.
Genial gpod fellowship bubbles
over in him and he kept things
moving along right lines all the
while. Here as elsewhere Latah
County's representative was both
honored and respected and was
listened to with marked attention.
He does not pose as a great orator
but every time he opens his mouth
he says something.
A non-partisan board of land
commissioners was strongly ad
vocated by the Commissioners.
Behren a—W ein
Miss Freda Behrens of Juliaetta
and Mr. Fred Wein of Leland were
married at the home of Mrs. Stan
ley Talbott at Lewiston last Satur
day evening at six o'clock. Rev.
Wm. Lattimore of the First Pres
byterian Church of Lewiston per
formed the ceremony.
Mrs. Wein is well known here
and has a large circle of friends
both in Kendrick and Juliaetta.

, make their home on the farm near
! Leland,
Owing to the vast amount of funds j
handled and the great value of
lands and timber still in the hands
of the state this board should be
appointed with greatest care and be
a character above reproach.
The commissioners also put them
selves on record maintaining good
roads in the state and the judicious
expenditure of money to that end.
The plans suggested meet with
universal approval. There are
great undeveloped resources in
Idaho that can be utilized only
through good roads.
Suggestions on needed legislation
were freely offered, and a legis
lative committee to urge upon the
legislature needed reforms in man
aging the county business, was
duly appointed.
"Elections and what they cost"
was ably handled by Mans H
Coffin,
county,
dress:
of
commissioner from Ada
We quote from his ad
:
The
average cost- of the pri
mary election alone to the counties
is over $100 per precinct or
$80,000 for entire state. There is j
one precinct where it cost more
than $20 per vote and several pre
cincts which the glorious privilage
of voting at the primary cost the
taxpayers between $10 and $18
per vote.
Do you think the taxpayer^ of
this state will be in favor of the
state-wide primary law when they
leam it cost them an average of j
$1.40 for every vote at the primary j
election? Don't you think, when i
...... ,.
they know it cost an average of |
$2.40 per vote to nominate and !
elect their officers that they will
demand an immediate drastic re- !
vision of all our election laws? Justj
who ii it that wants this primary
law? Who is it that will defend it !
in the name of honest, fair elec- i
.. „ .. , .
tions? Does it get us anywhere?
Can't we support, nominate and |
elect our worthy public men to 1
office without all this confusion
and expense.
"There is no good or sufficient
reason why an election • cannot be
conducted in our -state for 25 cents
per vote, or in other words 10 per
cent of the present cost."
There were many other good
things done that cannot be men
tioned in this brief space. The
letter is intended to call attention
to the importance of the work of
these county legislators to the
people all over the state. Greater
business efficiency can be brought
about through some slight changes
in the laws governing these bodies
and this is one of the things that
this meeting has set in motion.
.... ,
The state is looking to these men,
as never before, for a wise and
economical adminstration of its
affairs and it is hoped that these
annual meetings will grow in im
portance and usefulness.
Lowered Local Çepot
The Northern Pacific Railroad
Company has lowered the local de
pot a foot on its foundation and
also lowered the platform in front
of the depot to a level with the
track. This was done to make it

safer around the depot platform.
The railroad company is also having
an invoice taken of all of the prop

From One Sack of Flour
Here is an interesting item clip
ped from an eastern paper. A

ing of the high cost of living, kept

P r ' ce flour fluctuates. She

of bread in pans 9x4; 14 dozen and
two rolls, 72 biscuits, 10 loaves of
Boston brown bread, nine big two
layer cakes, 10 pies, 75 cookies, 29
jumbles. The bill for the cooking
and lighting at her home for a
month was $1.69. It does not cost
so much to live if a smart, capable
woman is in charge of the house.

One of the best dances ever given
in Leland was the one held there
last Friday, December 22. The

Study Club Entertains
The annual Christmas reception
of the Kendrick Study club was
held at the Fraternal Temple last
Wednesday evening with Mesdames
Moser, Crocker, Lewis, Porter, Old
field and Candee as hostesses. A
bout forty members of the club
were present and Mr. and Mrs.
White, E. P. Atchison, Percy Mc
Kenzie and Miss Pierson, of Spo
kane were guests of the club.
This annual social meeting of the
club has been one of the most
pleasing social affairs of the year in
the past and Wednesday evening
was not an exception. The Christ
mas spirit was in evidence every
where. The decorations carried
out the Christmas colors and con
sisted of red streamers of crepe tis
sue paper draped from the corners
of the room to the center and
bunches of holly and mistletoe in
profusion on the tables. A decor
ated Christmas tree added much to
the spirit of the occasion.
A delightful program was given.
^ consisted of vocal solos by Mrs.
Lon g and Mrs. Patton; a male quar
tet by Messrs. Best, Porter, Patton
McKenzie. A vocal solo by
Mrs. Oldfield, acompanied by Miss
Pierson at the piano and Mr. Old
field on the cello, was very pleasing.
A cello solo by Mr. Oldfield and a
piano solo by Miss Pierson followed.
Mrs. Best gave a reading accom
panied bv Mrs. McCrea at the
piano.
A guessing game afforded much
amusement for everyone. Five fort
unate ones received a perfect score
and were allowed first choice of a
Christmas present from the tree.
Most of the presents were toys and
contributed greatly to diminish any
feeling of formality for the rest of
the evening.
Refreshments were served on
tables decorated with holly paper
covers and napkins and candles with
paper shades of the same design.
Chicken salad, bread and butter
sandwiches, coffee, icç cream in the
Christmas colors and cake made up
a very satisfying and delightful
menu.
The one regret expressed on all
sides was to the effect that the An
nual Christmas Study Club evening
comes but once a year.
