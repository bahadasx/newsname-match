To Outlook Subscribers.
Owing to the continuad sharp
advances in tho price of paper
ami other raw material , tho pub-
ishers find it absolutely neces
sary to incroaso tho price of the
OuJook from $1.50 to $2.00 per
year. Tho extreme scarcity of
paper now forces us to pay for
tiiu raw material practically
lineo times the price páldnycar
ago, so while a small profit was
formerly made at tho price of
1.50 per year, tho sanie price
now causes us to loso money.
The advance to $2.00 per year
becomes effective January 1, 1017
Subscriptions lecoived prior to
tnis date will bo accepted at $1.50
And any subscription may be paid
as far in advance as desired at
ho did rare, provided payment is
rocoivcdiqij or bef oro January 1.
After that date subscriptions will
be strictly cash in,advance.
