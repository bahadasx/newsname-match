Putnam National Bank
PALATKA, FLORIDA
The week before Christmas, re
garded by merchants all over the
country as the best trading season of
the year, despite the two days of al
most incessant rain, was evidently the
best season for business Palatka mer
chants ever experienced. On Friday
and Saturday the crowds on the
streets were record breakers and trad
ing was sharp and brisk. The same
may be said of Tuesday, when the air
had a tinge of frost and to many was
an ideal day for the pie-Christmas
season.
Wednesday the rain came down
early in the afternoon and kept com
ing until after dark. Thursday all af
ternoon there was a regular cloud
burst. The rain started soon after 2
o'clock and fell in a continuous tor
rent until long after ten o'clock at
night. Water several inches deep
flowed down the brick paved streets
from curb to curb and it was impos
sible for people to get out.
The roads between here and Hast
ings and other points on the east side
or the river were in places impassi
ble and word was sent out which put
"the kibosh" on any hoped for trade
Irom that section. Not over half a
dozen automobiles were in the city
from points on the peninsula, Pomona,
Crescent City, etc., a section that
usually contributes much to Palatka's
Christmas trade in ordinary times.
Yet despite these embarrassing con
ditions, business was better than ever
before known. The News man inter
viewed a few of the leading merchants
and here is what they had to say:
J. H. Haughton We had a splen
did business' all the week and our
sales will go way ahead of any pre
vious year. On Saturday there was
a rush.
Ackeiman-Stewart There was a
steady business all the wa.ik and onr
clerks were kept busy. The sales
went way ahead of former years, but
we attributed it to the natural in
crease. L. A. Smith We were rushed to
death, especially on Friday and Sat
urday; business was way ahead of for
mer years.
M. S. Brown We had a splendid
business all the week, and despite the
inclement weather the daily average
was good. Friday and Saturday were
splendid days; yes, I think much bet
ter than last year. In addition, busi
ness has been good all this week, our
daily sales going way ahead of the
after Christmas days last year.
Tilghman Hardware Co. Yes, we
had a fine business, better than last
year. I expect we lost some small
trade in Christmas specialties because
of the removal of the postoffice,
though that will not make any dif
feernce in the year's business, not to
us, though the transients do not pass
our door now as formerly.
Fearnside Clothing Co. We had a
tremendous trade, the biggest in the
history of the business; even on Wed
nesday during the rain our force was
kept busy. On Tuesday and Friday
and Saturday we were simply swamp
ed this in spite of the fact that ma
ny of our best out-of-town customers
found it impossible to get to Palat
ka over the bad roads.
The Earnest Company Yes, our
business was great; way ahead of last
year; during the rainy days of the
week we ran way ahead in sales cf
our ordinary business days. But dur
ing the clear days we were simply
driven to exhaustion waiting on the
trade. It was the biggest pre
Christmas business we ever had ful
ly 50 per cent ahead of any previous
year. We certainly have reason to
feel gratified; we are gratified.
C. E. Rowton Biggest business we
ever had; will go 100 per cent ahead
of last year. Business began two or
three weeks ago with us and piled in
on us in increasing ouantities every
day; even the rain didn't seem to in
terfere with our trade.
"The Fashion" Of course this was
our first year in Palatka and there is
nothing we can use for a business
comparison, but we made our estimat
for a possible Christmas trade, and
we were liberal, but the actual re-
suits went wav ahead of our estimate.
Satisfied? Well, we should sav so.
Palatka Stationery Co. We had a
splendid business all through the
week, especially during the clear days.
We practically sold out everything of
a character designed for holiday gift'.
We had made an estimate of our
t rohable Ohritmar business, but we
went s far ahead of the estimate
that we are P'hamed of our i tt'e
ith. n-uig the surprises wns the

J. H. Yelverton, Jr., furniture We
had a good business, especially on
Friday and Saturday, but as I left
home the following day and only re
turned. I have not been able to figure

CAPT. PRITCHARD
OF EASTJOAST R'Y
Dies at Colorado Springs
Funeral Here on Sun
day Afternoon.
CROOKS GALORE
Capt. Thos. L. Pritchard one of the
best-known conductors of the Flagle
System, died at Colorado Springs,
Colo., last Sunday. News of his
death came with crushing suddenness
later in the day to his wife at her
home in St. Augustine, and from her
to members of the family in this city.
Capt. Pritchard had been at Colo
rado Springs for several months, sent
there on advice of his physician for
incipient tuberculosis of the throat.
His wife and five children remained
at their home in St. Augustine.
Deceased was a native of Aber
deen, Md., and was born on January
1st, 1872, consequently had he lived to
next Monday would have been 45
years of age. He came to Palatka
as a young man some 24 years ago
and a year later married Miss Mary
Martha Lannigan, a niece of Mrs
M. Shelley, Mrs. Mary Jennings and
Miss Kate Lucas of this city, Mrs. W.
A. Merryday of Seabreeze, Capt. J. E.
Lucas of this city and W m. H. Lucas
of Jacksonville. He lived here
number of years and was very popu
lar especially in baseball circles.
For the past 22 years he had been
constantly in the employ of the Flori
da East Coast Railway (Flagler
System) and at the time of his death
was second in senority among the
conductors of the system. Some sev
en or eight years ago Capt. Pritch
ard left Palatka with his family and
went to St. Augustine, the move be
ing made more for convenience in his
work.
He was prominent in Masonic cir
cles, being a member of Palatka
Lodge No. 23; St. Augustine Chap
ter No. 17, Morocco Temple in Jack
sonville, and St. Augustine Com-
mandery No. 10 Knights Templar.
He was also a member of the St. Au
gustine Lodge of Elks.
Besides his wife and five children,
he is survived by his father still liv
ing at Aberdeen, Md., one brother, G.
O. Pritchard of Jacksonville, and two
sisters, Mrs. Aitcheson of St. Augus
tine and Mrs. G. W. Evans of Ab
erdeen. Md.
Capt. Pritchard's body will arrive
in Palatka on Saturday about noon
and will be taken in charge by Moon
ey & Davis, who will take it to the
home of Mrs. Mary S. Jennings on
Fourth street. The funeral services
at her home in the afternoon will be
conducted by Rev. S. Grady of the
Methodist church. The Masonic or
der will attend in a body and will have
charge of the services at the grave in
West View cemetery.
It is thought that many of Capt.
Pritchard's associates on the East
Coast R'y will attend and that Ma
sonic representatives from St. Augus
tine and Jacksonville will also attend
the funeral.
Capt. Pritchard's death is deeply
felt by his numerous old friends in
this city and much sympathy is ex
pressed for the bereaved wife and
little ones.
VON ENGELKEN SLATED
FOR SECRE1
A special to the Florida Metropolis
from its staff correspondent in Wash
ington Wednesday evening stated that
the Assistant Secretary of the Treas
ury, W. P. Malburn of Denver, Colo
rado, is going to resign in a short
time and that F. J. H. von Engelken
of Palatka, Fla., the present Director
of the United States Mint, was slated
to succeed him.
Mr. von Encelken was never a poli
tician but he has given much time to
And Kept Police Busy Pro
tecting the People of
Palatka.
The News wouldn't have raid a
word about it had it not been for the
fact that one local publication spoke
of the outfit its "all men of honest
dealing" and their shows as "good,
clean amusement." Some of them
were; there is joy in the merry-go-round,
the Farris wheel, the goat
show and perhaps some others.
But the show was followed by a
host of crooks and "con men," skin
game gambfers and thieves, and had
it not been for the activity of the
police in suppressing many of them
there would have been a far differsnt
story to tell.
These crooks may not be connected
with the show, but certainly they do
not follow in it ; wake from week to
week without the knowledge or con
sent of the management.
Several times these crooks set up
their skin games only to be suppress
ed by P. M. Hagan who, by appoint
ment of the mayor, was serving as
special police. They had tents or
stalls and therefore could not operate
along with the carnival proper with
out the management's knowledge.
In addition there were all kinds of
light fingered gentry and sneak
thieves.
At least six Palatka homes were
lobbed by these people during the
week. They were those of Henrv
Broward, Mr. Fields of the G. S. &
F. R'y office, Dr. Sikes, Horace Bla
ney, Mrs. Jennings, H. Couver and E.
Alderman. Watches, diamonds and
other jewelry were taken, and other
valuables. Fortunately much of this
was recovered.
Two men were arrested; thev are
New York sneak thieves, and gave
their names as Frank Hall and Harry
Gebhardtt. Thev were assisted bv a
ittle nigger boy they impressed into
their service after coming to Pi-.latka.
He also is under arrest. His name
is Johnnie Graham.
The police were worried about these
robberies. They had captured the lit
tle negor boy, but were puzzled over
his principals. One night Officer Ha
gan saw a young white man looking
at a physician's thermometer several
times as if he was at a loss to know
what it was. He asked him where he
got it and the boy said it was given
him by one of the boys over at the
"Whip." Mr. Hagan went with the
boy over there and found that the
statement was true. But he took hr
voung man in just the same, and
through him he was successful in lo
cating the two thieves now under ri
pest and being held to the grand jury.
The little negro boy has identified
them as the ones who engineered the
house robberies.
"The city was full of crooks durin
this carnival," said Mr. Hagan, "and
had not we been on the watch con
stantly there would have been some
uscious skin games to chronicle.
Officers in the larger cities of the
State have received word not to allow
these "snow birds" and tramps t-o
inger in town, but to drive them out,
and The News believes that Chief
Livingston is going to keep them out
of Palatka.
CMGtipESDilY
New Officials to Take Hold
at Putnam County Court
House. '
Newly elected officials of Putnam
county will take office next Tuesday.
and as a result of the primaries and
.November election the changes will
be numerous.
County Clerk Hutchinson retires in
favor of R. J. Hancock, who for some
eight years has served as County
Tax Collector.
County Judge Haskell will retire
to private life and will practice law.
He has made Putnam county a most
painstaking, careful official and as a
result of his work the records of his
office' are up to the minute. He will
be succeeded by Attorney Julian C.
Calhoun, one of the youngest offi
cials ever to hold place in the court
bouse.
P. M. Hagan will become sheriff
in place of Sheriff R. Lee Kennerly,
for the past eight years one of the
most popular of our county officials.
Mr. Hagan served long as a deputy
under Mr. Kennerly and is familiar
with all details of his office. He has
also served as Chief of Police of Pa
latka, deputy United States Marshal,
and as deputy collector of Internal
Revenue.
Randall Wells, formerly county sur
veyor, will succeed Mr. Hancock as
county tax collector. He is a young
man, born and reared in Putnam
county and his friends are predicting
for him a popular administration.
C. H. Price, who is a father of a
very young family and has an addi
tional incentive to make tfocd schools
for the county, will succeed Prof. J.
D. Cottingham as superintendent of
schools. Prof. Cottingham, who has
made an excellent superintendent,
will retire temporarily to private life.
Henis Peterman will continue as
supervisor of registration: unlike the
others his office is not elective. He
was appointed by Gov. Trammell and
his term began with July 13th last.
He is nominated in the primary like
other officials, and the governor is
committed to the policy of appointing
whoever is the nominee of the prima
ry. That was Henis.
Col. A. S. Willard who has been
serving as county treasurer for the
past two years will render an account
to the commissioners and retire. He
is the last of a long line of county
treasurers, the office having beenl
abolished by vote of the peonle, to
whom the question was submitted by
the legislature of 1913.
The new board of county commis
sioners will meet also next Tuesday.
The board will be composed of
Mcs?r. W. C. Alvers, C. E. Rowton,
G. A. Turner. W. R. Revels and W. H.
Worley. Messrs. Alvers and Rowton
succeed themselves. Mr. Turner suc
ceeds Mr. Waldron of East Palatka,
Mr. Revels of Florahome succeeds Mr.
Hancock of Bostwick, and Mr. Worlev
succeeds Mr. E. B. Perry of Melrose.
The only change on the school
board is Mr. N. L. McRae who suc
