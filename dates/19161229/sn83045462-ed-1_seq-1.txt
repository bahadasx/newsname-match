RAILROAD BILLS
MAY BE RUSHED
Congress Is Expected to Hurry
Action in View of Exist
ing Situation.
STRIKE JANUARY 1 FEAHED
The sunmiarv breaking oft" of confer- '
enees yesterday between the railroad
broth rbo''?ls and the railway chiefs
over the application of the law requiring
railroads to pay ten hours' wages
for eight hours' work is expected to
hurry action in t'ongress on the pend-|
ing and proposed railway legislation, j
As the situation stands today, sporadic!
strikes on the railways after next Mon?'av
are apprehended. One of the most
important of the bills pending is the
measure authorising the President to
operate interstate railways in case of
strike. Uear;ngs are to begin on this
loll Tuesday before the Senate commit-;
t? ' on interstate commerce.
"While the new la wbecomes operative!
January 1. an agreement bad been enter*
1 into between the Department of
Justice and the railway beads that the
roads should not begin the new scale
"| wj?g*-s unui :i iter i ne case testing
the constitutionality of the act had
Uc.-n passed upon l?y the United States
Supreme Court.
Workers to Keep Account.
That body will take up the case for
trttuiiH'tit in the week beginning Janii:uy
ll. T!i? railroads had notified the
employes that books would be kept
upon the proposed new scale, though
the men wili be paid on the existing
scale, and if the law is upheld the men
are to receive the difference. Meantime
the brotherhoods and the railway chiefs
have been trying: to reach an agreement,
but their conferences adjourned
sine di?? yesterday without having been
of result.
F : r was expressed after the meeting
that some of the railway employes,
esf ecially upon western roads, may !
strike January 1, despite the agree- j
ment bet we* 1 the Department of ,
Justice and the railways over the en- j
forcernent <>f the law. Trouble is not j
apprehended in the case of the eastern !
trunk lines, however.
Must Await Arbitration.
Another bill pending before the Sen- j
ate committee, upon which hen rings j
will also be had, makes it unlawful to J
conduct a strike on an interstate rail
way pending arbitration. It is this
measure which is most objectionable to |
the railway brotherhoods, and it will,
be fought vigorously.
It is thought at the Capitol that in j
the absence of strikes these two bills
can be worked into some kind of shape
f'-r enactment before March 4, but if i
the transportation facilities of the '
country are threatened with paralysis?
t>y strikes meanwhile, action may have j
to be expedited.
Senator New lands, chairman of the '
Senate interstate commerce committee,
is in New York and not expected to re- j
turn t" Washington until the end of the!
week.
Has Faith in Brotherhoods.
Senator Townsend of Michigan, a I
member of the Senate* interstate commerce
committee, said today:
"I do not believe that the railroad
brotherhoods will strike. I believe that ;
they will await the decision of the Supreme
fv.urt in the Adamson eight-hour J
case and that they will abide by that
decision.
"Of course, if they should strike, then
the strenuous efforts of the President
and yielding of Congress to the demand.
of the brotherhoods last September
will have gone for naught.
"But public opinion would not support
them in a strike now, and I do not
believe that they will strike."
Senator Pornerene of Ohio, another
member of the committee, said that h<did
not see what. Congress could do to
avert a strike by the brotherhoods January
1 if they determined to strike. H<said
that he believed the Senate committee
would be a* expeditious as possible
in framing railroad legislation
which it now has before it for consideration.

PRESIDENT AGREES '
TO ISSUE OEM
Treasury Deficit, Which Confronts
Government at End of
Fiscal Year to Be Met.
President Wilson has tentatively
igreed with administration leaders in
'ongress on n bond issue to meet part
<f the Treasury deficit which confronts
he government for the fiscal year endng
June 30, 1918, estimated at aliout
>180,000,000. With Secretary McAdoo
he President is working on other
dans for raising additional revenue.
The President lias pointed our. that
ic believes a bond issue should be used
inly to meet temporary and emergency
rxpepdituren. - Many of these have been
;&used by the Mexican situation.
The Treasury already has authority
jy previous acts of Congress to issue
Panama bonds, and about $240,000,000
>f these are available. They would
jear 3 per cent interest.
Plans for Other Revenues.
Plans for raising the other revenue
ire understood to concern the income
lax, an inheritance tax and special
iaxes on internal revenue and imports.
The deficit figures differ according to
congressional and administrative viewpoints.
Secretary McAdoo estimated In
his annual repori the actual deficit in
the working balance of the Treasury
,n June 30. 1218. at $185,583,000, which
accounts for appropriations unexpended
combined with the left-over balance.
The congressional appropriations
committees, basing tfieir estimates upon
the actual appropriations, without regard
to whether the executive departments
spend all or part of the appropriations,
figure $313,2159,654 as the deficit.
Outstanding Bonds.
The outstanding interest-bearing debt
of the United States June 30 last, as
reported to Congress by Secretary McAdoo,
"amounted to $971,562,51*0. Exclusive
of postal savings bonds, oneyear
Treasury notes and conversion
bonds, this is made up of $1 18,489,900
4 per cents; $63,945,460 3 per cents (due
in 1918); $636,259,550 2 per cents (due
in 1930); $84,331,980 Panama bonds,
bearing 2 per cent, and $50,000,000
Panama 3 per cents, similar to those to
be issued.
HUGE BEAR !S SLAIN
IN W. VA. MOUNTAINS
Sj??*?ial J>ispatch to The Star.
WINCHESTER. Va.t December 2'J.?
Dynamite and sledge hammers were
used the other day in order to dislodge
a 420-pound bear that had'taken refuge
in a cave in the mountains near Wardensville,
Hardy county, W. Va. It was
the largest bear ever seen in* that locality.
A party of hunters composed of John
F. Keck lev. H. W. Baughman, T. B. and
Edward W uson and John W. Tharp
found the bear tracks early in the day.
The tracks were followed until late in
the afternoon and led the hunters to a
den in the rocks of the mountain.
Baughman managed to squeeze through
an opening far enough to see the bear,
which he shot several times with a pistol.
Although wounded, the hear started
to charge and Baughman crawled out.
Edward Wilson and Keckley rushed
upon the scene with Winchester rifles
and tireu nine shots into the bear's
body before the huge form fell prostrate
to the 'ground.
The men found it was impossible to
get the bear out, so they went to Wardensville
and procured some* dynamite
and sledge hammers with which to
make an opening. After blasting for
several hours the bear was finally gotten
out of the cave. Now all the people
of Wardensville are celebrating the
holidays with bear meat supper parties.
Residents of that section in town today
say many other large bear tracks
have been seen within a inile of Wardensville
during the past week.
