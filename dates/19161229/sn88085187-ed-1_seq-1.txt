Tacoma May Extend Its City Limit.
MAYOR
FAVORS
CAR TO
POINT!
Annexation by tin- city of
Tacoina ot the lide-flatK all
the way hark to the ea*t side
hill, and extension of the
municipal Htreet NaT line lo
Browns point, win* suggested
hy Mayor Fawcett to Ihe
council Friday.
Kawrett declared that the tide
flats iii.inurn. i ni iiik district,
which promises to expand greatly
ln the next few years, will expect
adequate fire protection, and that
this protection cannot lie granted
unless the district is taken Inside
the city limit*.
The mayor's suggestion was
made after announcement of a
Joint meeting of the city and
county commissioners late Friday
to consider the application of
Frank ('. Ross for a franchise to
lay water mains on the tideflats.
Against Franchise.
The city does not want such a
franchise granted, liecause the
flats will all be inside city lioun- j
darles ill a short time, and the I
water department would lie forced j
later either to compete with a'
private concern or to buy outright!
the Itoss property.
"I am strongly in favor of tak- (
ing in the flats, then extending i
the municipal car line to Drowns]
point. The South Tacoma fran- ]
chlse of the T. R. „ I*. Co. ex
pires in 1917, and I favor a mu
nicipal line from Browns point to
South Tacoma. It would he the
biggest moneymaker in the coun
try," said the mayor today.
"I have already notified Man
ager Bean that because of hlsi
action In trying to throw out all]
protective parts of present fran
chises I would fight any petition
for a renewal of his South Taco
ma franchise.
Petition to Be Circulated.
"The city should build its
tideflats line clear across the
flats, giving transportation to all
persons working in the new ship
yards and other factories, then
should go on to Browns point,
where the summer colony is."
The city council agreed heart
ily with Mayor Fawcett.
A petition asking annexation to
the city will shortly be circulated
among owners of tideflats prop
erty, It was reported.
Changes Mind
On Army Post
At the army post meeting at
Spanaway Thursday evening, Rev.
W. D. Buchanan, a farmer near
Spanaway, who at a former meet
ing opposed the post, made the
public statement that after the
project had been explained to hi-ii
he had changed his mind and is
sure it would he a most beneficial
thing to the state.
A majority of those present fa
vored the plan.
COUNCIL TO HOLD
"ANTI" MEETING
A campaign against the army
post bonds ls planned by the Cen
tral Labor council of Tacoma,
which has challenged the army
post committee to send speakers
to debate the question with them
in the city and county.
The council is arranging for a
public meeting the latter part of
next week, and has asked Mayor
A. V. Fawcett to be present and

Do Their Own Thinking
BY THE EDITOR
I am aware that many enthusiastic supporters
of the army post project are somewhat concern
ed because the central labor council has seen fit
to go on record in opposition.
As one who is whole-heartedly FOR bringing
the army headquarters to Pierce county, I am
more inclined to welcome the labor council's de
cision.
For I know, in Ihe first place, that the action
does not represent the general opinion of Taeo
ma labor; it simply represents the Opinion of the
majority of the small number of delegates who
make up the central council.
Then, too, this opposition, or any other such
opposition, will serve a valuable purpose in stir
ring the community to the need of VOTING-.
The enterprise is entitled to receive the consid
eration of every citizen in the county, not of the
few hundred who usually constitute the elector
ate at a special election.
The average working man in Pierce county, be
he farmer or city resident, can see beyond the
end of his nose.

"During a slave raid at Arlon,

"This suffices to prove that

fend their policy of deportations
on the ground that they are thus
checking unemployment, they are
merely trying to bluff neutrals."
