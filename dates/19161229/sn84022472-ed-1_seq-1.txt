not discuss ; the matter. Police de

A Farmer representat ive ' learned
today from a., prominent city official
in no way connected with the pqlice

wrote a. letter protesting against such
gross neglect of an injured man; that
a . record of the facts is in black and

to look at them.
Christmas night the Devitt woman,
who had slipped and fallen, suffering
a fracture of her skull and hip, was
found lying unconscious on the side
walk at Park avenue and State street,
by a policeman. He had her taken
to poli"" headquarters. The physician
was" called to examine her. Hebetated
that there was nothing wrong with
Mrs. Devitt except intoxication.
The police naturally booked her on
that charge, as the woman could not
'walk. When released in bonds and
carried away the cause of her condi
tion Was apparent when members of
the famjlv . summoned a doctor who
advised her Immediate-removal to the

Salary of $1,200.
Reorganization , of the city court,
with general and generous- boosting
salariesi will be effected if the board
of apportionment , sanctions the de
mands made today by those connect
ed with the court.
. The requisition filed with City Aud
itor Keating calls for a raise in the
salary of the judge, from $2,500 to
$3,000; of the deputy judge, from
$1,500 to $2,500; the prosecutor, from
$2,000 to $2,500, his assistant, from
$1,000 to . $2,500, so that, he .may be
on ah equal footing with the regular
prosecutor; of the clerk, from $1,000
to $2,000 and his assistant from $1,000
to $2,000 to placehim on an equal
footing. "It also calls for 1,200 to
be paid an officer for the prosecuting
office. ' ' ' ' ' c - ' -
According to this schedule, Prose
cuting ' Attorney A. L. DeLaney will
.conduct ,the prosecuting office, if the
plan goes through, but the other pros
ecutor will divide , the responsibility
with him and do an equal share of
the work. He will be paid the same
salary as Mr. DeLaney. ... ; ' '
'The latter wants an officer, who will
take complaints, anct make investiga
tions, before any case is brought to
the attention of the prosecutor. The
prosecutor will' judge the merits of
the. case from the state's viewpoint, on
his reports.
"No man on earth can handle all
the cases that come into .my office.
and carny on a private practice at the
spme time," said Mr."-DeXaney. "For
every 20 cases that go, into court, I
settle 60 outside'. I. need hfelp with
this immense volume of business."
Mr. DeLaney said he had nobody in
mind for the joh. .
Hitherto there Jhas been a hitch over
the amount of work the prosecutor
and his. assistants are . required to do.
Sometimes' one would take the job for
three weeks at a stretch, with a re
sultant damage to his private prac
tice Mr. DeLaney wishesr to "equalize
this work and an effort isr: being made
to abolish tbe assistant plan and have
two prosecutors, having ejtiual salaries.
The'same applies to the Clerkship. '
The budget for . the police- court for
1917 totals $24,6S0, s against . $H,80 for
the -present year. ' .

policy but had previously -issued a
$3,000 and a fire insurance policy Aon
the Small home and its contents.
Charles E. Merritt of. Manchester,

Mutual Life Insurance Co., said that a
$20000 joint policy 'on .the lives of
Small and his wife had been issued by
his company. The policy was not is
sued on a joint application, he testi
fied, because Small had signed for his
wife as well as for. himself, claiming
that he had a right' to do so. A sec
ond - application: was required aad was
signed by Mrs. Small. On March' 13,
Small paid the first annual premium

The policy, the witness testified, was
payable to the vsuryivor, or, if both
