of the various county, ' central tiom
Tnittees the matter will be - brought
tn thn attention of the legislature In
'session' next month; Should that
body take favorable" action on the
proposition the law granting the in
crease would take effect two years
hence and insure for the officers then
elected the benefit of the raise.
The recommendation or rejection
of the proposition by the Greenlee
county central committee will be
awaited with Interest by the public,
as well as the outcome in the otner
counties of the state.

BOOZE IS TO FLOW
ON PHOENIX STREETS
PHOENIX Ariz., Dec. 25-Acting
under an order of the superior court
Issued today. Sheriff Adams tomor
row will dispose of nearly one thous
and gallons of -various liquors seized
since Arizona went . dry, employing
the unusual method of spraying the
business streets of Phoenix with the
liquor. ' ..
One of the largest, -of the city's
sprinkling wagons will be used. A
deputy sheriff will ride with the
driver of the "water wagon" to see
that no thirsty individuals regale
themselves from the spouts . Prohi
bition forces expect to make a gala,
affair of the incident.
Ever since Arizona went into the
c"ry column the sheriff has been
adding to his contraband stock -of
booze. He now has a good sized
room at the county jail about filled
anC has been forced to ask relief
of the court. At first- he had in
tfnded to cart, the liquors to the
river and dump them over board,
but recently he decided this was
too mediocre a method . ' The use
of a city sprinkling wagon was sug
gested to him and he adopted the
Idea.
A band will lead the procession,
which will include scores of auto
mobiles in which prohibition forces
pill ride.

J 'Sometime early Wednesday morn

The Standard Oil Company .informs
us that shippers of apples and pota
toes, apples particularly, have taken
to the idea and are now taking or
dinary cars from the railroads ' and
equipping them with heaters. ' The
company's main station at Tacoma,
the report says, sold out its entire
stock of heaters in a week, to parties
in the fruit packing districts of the
Northwest, and still the- cry is "mote
heaters."
Most of these heaters will go east
and never' come back, but the fruit
crop is moving, thanks to the effi
ciency and reliability of the modern
kerosene heater

10 SUCCEEDS MR.
CAMPBELL IS
RUESTl
Who wfll be the next tax commis
sioner? That question is being asked
a dozen times a day at the state
house, seemingly because practically
everyone is anxious to know who his
or her neighbor is going to be. .
According to report at the capital
the governor has put 'it up to Chair
man Charles R. Howe of th tax com
mission, iahd -fnember C. M. Zander
to get together and decide who they
would lllce to have take the position
which w$l be;.iempty when Governor-
elect. Campbell -becomes the head of
the executive department. It was
stated a few days ago at republican
headquarters that Mr. Campbell
would - probably resign about the 28
The governor is maintaining the
same silence in regard to the new ap
pointment as he does about all offi
cial business . '
Half a dozen prominent democrats
hazarded guesses yesterday that the
new appointee would be Homer
Wood of Prescott. In fact one Demo
crat said that Mr. Wood had been ten
dered the ' place, and could have it -if
he would : condescend to- accept. It
was said, though that Mr. Wood's ex
tensive interests in thB north would
not permit of his giving his whole
attention to the office. ' ,
"-hers mentioned for the place are
Sam Barclay, -member of the state
land appraisers board; James H.
Kerby, assessor of Greenlee county;
Sam. Proctor of Williams, and ' A. B
Ming;:- assessor of Yuma coWnty.
Next to Homer Wood, Ming seems
o have the best opportunity to bring
home the bacon . His name is men
tioned prominently in "connection with
the place' by those who are opposed
to the. governor, as well as by those4
vho.-arefJ-n . his parade, so it seems
that In case Wood decides to. remain
on hia barony in the' north, Ming will
Je'th6 lucky candidate.
'And by the way, the rest of the can
didates who went through fire and
water and put terriffic dents in the
family bankroll in order to attain of
fice at the late election, all feel' that
whoever succeeds Mr. Campbell will
I,;? lucky indeed. "Think of it," they
pay. ' "All he has to do is to write
in a letter to the governor spend a
little money on postage writing te a
few friends asking them to pull a few
strings, and the. first think he knows
he is in office." But then some pes
simist spoke -.up and intimated that
perhaps the -lucky" appointee won't be
so lucky after all. It is pointed out
that the governor' has 'come- down
heavy on his appointees for ready. cash
with which -to finance' his contest, and
nff-'doubt the new tax commissioner
will come in for his share - of the

SAFFORD, ;Dec. 22. Three con
victs at the state camp above Solomon
ville tried to make their escape about
l:30 o'clock yesterday morning, with
the result that . one .was killed, one
wounded- and the third one got back
in his tent before the officers could
discover his identity. .'
According to the story . at the coro
ner's inquest, when the guards, dis
covered the three men running to the
fence, they called on them to halt.
They continued on and were in the
act of . climbing over the fence when
the guards fired. Two men fell, to
the ground and the' third ran hack to
camp. ...
When the guards reached the fallen
men" they found ' one ' dead and the
other wounded. Thev guards recog
nized the dead. man as No. 4848, Jesus
Rodriguez, and the wounded mail was
No. 47.62, Miguel ORamirez.
Doctors Stratton and McWhirt were
summoned from Safford. When the
doctors reached the camp they found
on' examination that Rodriguez' was
shot ih the back, and that a buck shot
had penetrated the heart, causing his
death. ' - ,L ' '
Ramirez was only slightly wound
ed, one shot struck back of the left
ear and another one entered the left
shoulder. ......
The verdict of the coroner's jury
was that Rodriguez came to his death
as the ' result of a gunshot wound
while attempting to escape.

GOV. HUNT" GETS PLOW SHARE
FROM WILLIAM J. BRYAN
PHOENIX,' Ariz., . Dec! 25 Gov.
Hunt received yesterday afternoon
probably the most unique Christmas
present contained in .the mails com
ing into Phoenix . . It came from Wil
liam - Jennings Bryan, and now
proudly rests on the governor's desk
in use as a paper weight.
- Evidently believing in spreading
his peace propaganda in every form
possible, the distinguished comi
moner has had made a plow share
in miniature resting on a solid steel
base. The whole thing is silver
plated. On one ' side of the plow
share is engraved the following
words: "They shall beat their
swords Into plow shares" Isaaiah 2:4.
On one side of the shaft attached to
the plow share is engraved "Diplo
macy is the art of keeping cool,"
while on the opposite side rests the
words, "Nothing Is final between
friends."
The whole creation is well got up
and is 'an eloquent' piece of work
! throughout. The governor is exceed-
mgiy proua 01 nis . utile present,
though it is not . known whether he
takes the same fatherly interest ' in
the peace movement as does Mr.
Bryan.
