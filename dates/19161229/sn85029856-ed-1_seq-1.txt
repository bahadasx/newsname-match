V BLAKE OIL CO. SOLD
' ' y , A deal was consumated last week
whereby the entire Interests of the
Slake Oil Company passed Into the
fcaads .of the Cudahy Refining Co.
This is one of the biggest deals from
every standpoint ever made in the
'Southwest. The Blakes have sta
llions in Liberal, Elkhart, Hugoton,
Moscow, Satanta, Copeland, Sublette,
Montezuma, Dodge City, all in Kan
safe, and Tucumcari, New Mexico. We
- have not heard the amount of cash
Tequired to Awing the deal, but it
must have taken quite a pile of the
wherewithal. The firm handled re
ined petroleum and Its products, and
dld an enormous wholesale and re-
, tail business through Its different
branch houses. E. J. Stutsman, the
Junior member of the firm, will re
y main with the new firm for a while
. at least as its local manager. Mr.
' Blake, the president of the oil com
pany has not decided af thh time
what Ills-next venture will be, but
tho fimfUar with his hostKng'aVitf
ties know he won't be idle very long.
- . . ' NOTICE
'l Owing to the rapidly increasing
tost of all materials I have found it
absolutely necessary to make all
' work turned out from my shop cash
after January 1. This step is made
for the reason that it Is impossible
. for me to carry accounts for six
months or a year, and that cash Is
needed in running a business today
more than ever before. I will appre
ciate a coutinuance of business from
all my -customers and guarantee work
satisfactory.

HANCOCK ENTERTAINS THJB r
, . YOUNGSTERS . . ;
' C. E. Hancock, contractor and
home builder, decided it would be
good stunt Saturday to give the
youngsters of, the town a Joyride and
a small Christmas remembrance.
Piling over a hundred of them Into
his big Apperson to which were at-
tached two large trailers, he proceed
ed to parade the streets, later taking .
them to one of his houses in the 8un
nyslde addition to meet Santa Clans.
Albert Slade of the Griffith A Baugh-
man office played the part of Santa
and did It to perfection. He appeared
at the proper time and presented
f.sqh.jrqqngAmerican, with l(sack"
containing' candy .and an orange.
While parading through town the
kjda;kept. up, a.cjonstant refrfjn of;
"Hancock, Hancock, -' '
Going for ride, ,
Out to see Santa Clans
In Sunnyslde." .
., The car and trailers were appro
priately decorated with ads. of Sun
nyslde lots and Hancock's home
building proclivities. The afternoon
was thoroughly enjoyed by the lit
tle fellows and the spectators as well,
and several people now know of Han
cock and 8unnyeide whose attention
has perhaps never been called to.

FALLS AND BREAKS HIP
Mrs. C. R. Wright, mother omERSs
Kate and Carson Wright, while dress
ing Saturday morning, stooped ' to.
pick up something from the floor and
fell in such a manner as to break her
hip. Her other daughter, Mrs. L. J.
Pettyjohn, came down from Dodge
City Monday, and accompanied by Dr.
Nichols, the Injured lady was taken
to the hospital in Dodge City. There
an- X-ray examination of the injury
was made which showed that the hip
had really been broken. Dr. Nichols
returned from Dodge Wednesday and
reports Mrs. Wright " resting easily
and having stood the trip up there in
good shape, but owing to the severe
pain It Is doubtful if she can stand
having the broken bone set. Mrs.
Wright hl-years of -agend -oiriy
year ago fell and broke an arm. This"'
jater affliction will no doubt be haro
for a person of her age to get over.
Her numerous friendB wlll regret
greatly to learn of the accident.
