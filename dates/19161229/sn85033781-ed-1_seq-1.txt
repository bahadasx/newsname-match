SIS EXAMINATIONS
State Board of Health Starts
Campaign in Van Buren Co.
Week of January 18th.
ETERNAL VIGILANCE NEEDED
If the Dreaded Disease is to be
Eradicated. Prevalent in
this County as Elsewhere
Perhaps the one thing that more
than anything else will restrain people
from coming to the free tuberculosis
examinations that the state board of
health will conduct in Van Puren coun
ty during the week beginning January
fifteenth will be fear to face the facts
;ibout their physical condition. There
js in many people an unreasonable
ear of tuberculosis which, Dr. Win.
DeKline, director of the survey, as
serts, is responsible for a great deal
of real harm. Many a man who feels
himself run down is afraid to be ex
amined for fear that his suspicions
that he may have tuberculosis may
prove to be correct.
"Fear should not hold any one back'
said Dr. DeKline. "A person who is
run down and who is told that he has
tuberculosis should be glad he has
learned the real state of things in
time. If he takes the examination
early enough, he has nine chances out
of ten of getting well. Personally i
would rather have tuberculosis than
:many other disease that is lightly re
garded, provided I knew it in time.
Jn fact more people get well from
tuberculosis than from almost any
other important disease.
"But the point must be boiTM in
mind that the disease must be attend
ed to early. And that is what the
state board of health is trying to do
in these county campaigns, to help
people to attend to it early. I hope
for that reason that all persons who
.are physically run down will come to
the free examinations when they are
held here."
Figures gathered from the county
records show that the death rate in
this county from tuberculosis is
about as high in proportion to popu
lation as in most of the other counties
in the state. It simply proves once
more, what is well known to tuberculo
.sis workers, that there is no commun
ity free from the disease and that
much hard work has to be done here
as well as everywhere else, if the
death rate is to be cut down in Michi
gan as the state board of health hopes
to cut it down. There is much op
portunity in this county for construct
ive work along health lines, the state
health workers assert.
HOMER WINS ANOTHER FIGHT
We quote from the Evening Tele
graph of Philadelphia which itatet
that Homer Smith the Paw Taw heavy
weight, defeated CleTi Hawkins of
Montreal in every round of a ten
round contest at Allentown, Pa., the
night of December 22nd. Hawkins
down for the count of nine once
in the fourth and twice in the fifth
und. It was one of the fastest
i'avy weight contests seen in Allen
town in years.
Fred Holt certainly had the right
kind of Christmas spirit. He was
called to the Amelia Hentley rooms
to fix her stove. He found that about
the only way to fix it was with a new
one. So he started out with a sub
scription paper and soon had enough
money raised to buy a nice new stove
which he proceeded to set up in place
of the old one.
UBERCULO
EFFORTS OF
PAW PAW CHURCHES
The spirit of union and hearty co
operation among the churches of I 'aw
Paw is noticeable and pleasing. In
the first place, the brotherly attitude
of the pastors toward each other has
been very gratifying. For months
they have planned and labored to
gether in the closest of fellowship.
This in turn has had a salutary in
fluence upon the churches, bringing
the rank and file of the members into
the closest fraternal feelings.
The growing conviction that in
union there is strength has led the
churches to unite in the great Taber
nacle movement. To this end there
will be union meetings all through
January, in preparation for the great
community meeting in February.
The tirst meeting will be a Watch
Night service at the Presbyterian
church next Sunday night. Besides
the Sunday evening union services,
the Thursday evening prayer meet
ings will unite, and union cottage
prayer meetings will be held all over
the city.

ation Wai held in Paw Paw last week.

much during the period of its exist

I in the years to come. No farmer
! can afford to remain outside of this
I live farmer's organization.

SOME RABBIT KILLING, THIS
A clipping brought to The True
Northerner office by Ed. DeHaven
tells about a rabbit hunt in Mexico,
Missouri that was some hunt. The
item states that "Two teams of far
mers, numbering seventy in all, killed
fifteen hundred and twenty rabbits in
OM day at Molino, Missouri. It took
a large farm wagon with double side
hoards to haul them into the city.
The proceeds will be used for a dinner
to the winning team. This is the
largest rabbit killing record for one
day in the state."
Miss Kosina Waters who is teach
ing in Wyanet. Illinois, is home for
the holidays.
ANNUA
MEETING
PAW PAW, MICHIGAN, FRIDAY DECEMBER 29, 1916
NATTER OF GRAVE CONCERN
The True Northerner has been thus far very modest,
and has tried to refrain from continual "Sobbing" about the
high cost of print paper. Nevertheless, the high price
continues and it is a serious problem that confronts not only
The True Northerner, but every country paper in the United
States. The very best price that is quoted now on news
paper print is $140.00 per ton. This price is three times
as much as the same stock cost one year ago. We called
the attention of our subscribers to this condition some weeks
ago, and since that time we have mailed a personal appeal
to every subscriber who was in arrears. The results have
been very satisfactory, and the great majority of our list
have realized the importance of prompt payment, and now
hold a receipt to some time in 1917, and many of them even
to the year 1918. There are some however, who have
cither mislaid the notice, or have forgotten to give the mat
ter prompt attention. To those who have perhaps inad
vertently overlooked us, we desire again to urge the necess
ity of prompt payment. If you have lost the slip which
was mailed you, examine the date stamped opposite your
name on the margin of the paper, and if it does not bear
some date in 1917, you are in arrears. We dislike to press
the matter, but we must have the money that is due us on
subscription.
Many papers all over the country have already raised
the price but we have hoped that there might be some
change which would do away with the necessity of an ad
vance in our subscription rates. The cost of print paper is
now under investigation by the United States Government,
but there is no relief in sight yet. We have therefore de
cided to accept all arrearages and advance subscriptions
during the month of January at the old rate of $1.00 per
year in the county, and $1.25 outside the county. This old
rate remember, is for the month of January only.

PAYS TRIBUTE TO
TIE EVANGELISTS
Honeywell says Nice Things
about the McCombs, who will
hold Meeting here.
Dr. I. E. Honeywell, who was associ
ated with Billy Sunday in his great
tabernacle campaigns, and is consider
ed to be second to Mr. Sunday, in the
evangelistic field, has this to say
about Rev. J. H. MeCombe and Mrs.
MeCombe who are to hold a tabernacle
meeting in Paw Paw, in Februan .
"Rev. J. H. MeCombe and Mrs. Me
Combe have been associated with me
for the past three years, carefully
studying Union Tabernacle work, and
at the close of our campaign here are
going out into work of their own.
If you have any thought of an
Evangelistic effort, I am confident
that you could not possibly do any
thing better than to secure Kev. J. H.
MeCombe and his party to lead you
in such work, moreover, I am sine
that a great victory would be won
for your town and the Kingdom.
Rev. MeCombe has all the qualifi
cations of a successful Evangelist.
He is an exceptionally strong preacher
a good singer, a fine business man,
with a very wide experience.
safe, sane, with a winning personality.
He is most thoughtful and consider- :
ate of pastors, never humiliating them
before the people, but rather exalting
and dignifying their position. He has :
conducted Union Tabernacle meetings
with my pa ty, during summer
months, while I have been resting, and
with very marked success. There are
tew men in the Fvangelistic field to
day in my judgment, that are better
qualified to lead the churches in a
Union Evangelistic Campaign than
Mr. MeCombe.
Mrs. MeCombe is an exceptionally '
successful Christian worker, in fact, !
I regard her as the best lady Christ-1
ian worker in the Evangelistic field '
today. A vmy itTOtlg Methodist
preacher of New York stated last win- j
t r that Mrs. MeCombe was the best j
lady preacher he had ever heard. She
does a wonderful work among the
business women, the High school girls
and the society women of the town.
Mr. and Mrs. MeCombe have master
ed every detail in connection with
Union Tabernacle work. I would re
gard your city most fortunate if they
would arrange there with Mr. Me
Combe to lead you in a Union Evan
gelistic effort. I would not recom
mend a brother friend if I did not be
lieve he could deliver the goods, but
with the greatest confidence, I recom
mend Mr. MeCombe and his party to
you, and in doing so, feel that I am
rendering a gjprvice to your churches
and the Kingdom fully as much as to
Mr. McComhe."

99 Cases. Only Six Crim-
inal Cases.
THIRTY-NINE DIVORCE GASES
Wife the Complainant in 25
Cases. Twenty of the Cases
Not Contested.
Circuit Court for Van Buren County
will convene on January 8th. The
jury will not come however until a
week later, January 15th, and follow
ing the usual custom, the first week
will be taken up with the arrange
ment of the calendar, and the dispos
ition of chancery matter.-.
The calendar for this term will con
sist of ninety-nine cases, divided as
follows: Criminal, six; Issues of
Fact, non jury' twenty-three; Chan
cery, sixty-two. Cases in which no
progress has been made for more than
one year, Law, four; Chancery, four.
On the Criminal calendar, five of
the respondents are charged with Lar
ceny, and one for assault with intent
to commit the crime of Incest. This
will be the first term for the new
Prosecuting attorney, and no doubt he
will be grateful for the short Crim
inal calendar.
Of the Chancery division of the cal
endar, thirty-nine out of the sixty-two
eases are petitions for divorce. No
appearance of defendant has been en
tered in twenty of the cases, and they
will probably not be contested. In
twenty-five out of the thirty-nine di
vorce cases, the bill of complaint is
filed by the wife, while the husband
is the aggrieved party in but fourteen.
