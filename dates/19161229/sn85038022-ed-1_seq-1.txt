ANOTHER CAUCUS

Honromit.
A caucus wan held by tho members
of th City Council laat evening In the
sleeping; quarters of the Washington
Fire Depart nient over the Washington
Opera I louse. The session did not last
any length of time and was very
peaceable according to what we could
gather.
Following the caucus the ledger
representative obtained the result of
the meeting which was as follows:
Fire Chief Rullff Newell.
Firemen Andrew Reed, James
Buckley. Russell Oreenlee and George
Duley.
Police Sergeant William Tolle.
There was no one running for the
pcsltion as firemen but there were
several candidates In the field for
nigbt sergeant and this made It a very
difficult thing to pick the winner. We
do not In the least doubt that Mr.
Tolle will make on excellent sergeant
as he has been a policeman and we
wish htm the best of success In that
position.

WH AWtRIKI PRI.K
Mr. James Mrosheara of thla city,
supervisor of track on the rinclnnatl
imiainn of the C. O. Railroad be
tween Sliver Orove and Concord, has
been awarded a second prise of $60
for having the second best kept divi
sion on the system. The first prise
went to a supervisor on the Ashland
division of the railroad. Beckon fore
men Sears of Robbtown, and Kw Mo
Nutt of Dover, were awarded first and
second prises respectively under Mr.
Rroshears for the best kept section
This record certainly speaks well of
Mr. Broshcars. who has bad charge of
this section of the division for only a
lew months. He Is regarded as one of
the most capab'o men on the entire
Fystem and he certainly Is a very ef
lelent and capabm supervisor.

INDOOR BASEBALL
i. imie Will Re Opened In the Thomas
Building on North Market Street
This Evening at 780 o'clock
Promises to Re Great
Sport.
As will be noted In another part of
the Ledger the indoor baseball game
will open in the old Thomas building
on North Market street tonight at
7:30 o'clock. This game holds the
promise of becoming very popular In
this city and looks to be very Inter
esting.
A ledger representative visited the
building yesterday afternoon and the
workings of the game were explained
to him. The game Is played similar
to outside baseball. The ball Is thrown
to the batter automatically who hits
it If possible. The ball is thrown at
varying speeds and at different angles.
Home runs, three base hits, etc., are
counted by the place to which the hall
is knocked by the hatter. A home
run counts four points, a three base
hit three points, etc. A total of nine
Innings Is played by the batter and at
the end his score Is told.
The game will be under the man
agement of Messrs. Charles Frohwlne
anil William Doyle. The latter gentle
man Is well known in this city being
a promoter of the old Bluegrass and
the Ohio State Leagues. Mr. Froh
wlne Is a brother-in-law of Mr. Doyle
and Is an excellent gentleman.
1 he game of indoor baseball is not
confined to ball players but all can
participate in If. The only exertion
is In the batting, no running being
necessary. The game was invented
on the I 'at Hie Coast about two years
ago and since that time has spread all
over tho country. It Is fast becoming
one of the most popular Indoor sports.
T he gentlemen have expressed tho
plan of organizing teams to play one
another and later if this Is accom
plished leagues will be organized and
the game carried out as It is In the
regular outdoor game.
