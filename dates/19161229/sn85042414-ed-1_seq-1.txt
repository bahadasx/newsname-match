SPAIN SURPRISES
BERLIN WITH A
VIGOROUSNOTE
Makes a Strong Protest
Against Submarine War
fare of Germany.
INTERNATIONAL LAW
VIOLATED BY PILOTS
Message More Severe Than
Those of any Other Neu
tral, it is Said.
Madrid (Via Paris), Dec. 29.—The
note addressed to Germany on the
submarine question by the Spanish
government declares that the Spanish
government has always maintained
that it was illegal to destroy prizes,
as is the constant practice of subma
rines, and that the cabinet also de
manded the observation of the dec
laration of London, notably Article
50, which it is maintained, subma
rines violate by abandoning tho crews
of sunken ships to the mercy of the
waves far from land.
The note further recalls the vigor
of the representations of the Spanish
government, which, it says, sometimes
caused the Berlin government to be
surprised at the radical attitude of
Spain, whose protests, it is held, have
been more energetic than those of any
other neutral state, even the United
States of America. With regard to
the contraband question, the note
says:
"What the Spanish government does
not admit is the central empire's in
terpretation of international law
whereby they destroy ships of nations
which have always complained and
protested against such an interpreta
tion."
Washington Surprised.
Washington, IJec. 29.—Spain's ac
tion towards the German submarine
campaign caused surprise here be
cause no such vigorous statement
from Spain had been expected. It
nevertheless is thought to have come
at an opportune time to add another
source of pressure on Germany in
what tho state department considers
a most serious condition.

NEW RAILWAY MILEAGE
BUILT IN 1916 LOW
Chicago, Dec. 29.—Although the
year 1916 was one of record-break
ing traffic and earnings, new mileage
built was the smallest, with the ex
ception of 1915, since the Civil War,
according to a review of the railroad
situation, which is printed In today's
edition of the Railway Age Gasette.
Jn 1916, 1,098 miles were construct
ed, compared with 9S3 the preceding
year. The second-track mileage of
the year was 366, or 44 miles less
than 1915. In Canada only 290 miles
of new track were laid, compared
with 718 in 1915 and-978 in 1914.
New mileage projected in the Uni
ted States is 727 that being surveyed
2,126 and that actually built 1,060.

U. S. MAKES PROTEST
AGAINST EXECUTION
OF ELTON IN MEXICO
Mexico City, Dec. 29.—Charles B.
Parker, the American charge d' af
faires, under Instruction from the
state department at Washington, to
day presented to the foreign office a
protest against the refusal of the
Mexican government to postpone the
execution of Howard Elton, an Amer
ican mining engineer, who was put
to death ten days ago, at Oaxaca. El
ton was convicted by court martial
of fomenting a revolution against the
government. The state department
had' requested a delay in his execu
tion in order that it might investigate')
the case.
Elton was arrested last August and
tried and convicted of treasonable
activity in aiding the rebels in Oaxaca.
He was sentenced to death but on
representations by the American gov
ernment a stay of execution was
granted. According to a dispatch
from Washington December 20, a re
opening of the case enabled Elton to
produce no evidence that altered the
findings of the courts. Elton's widow
resides in Waterbury, Conn.

TO GIVE RELIEF
TO PUBLISHERS,

Federal Commission Deter
mined to Find Way Out
of "Difficulties.
MORE TESTIMONY
IS HEARD TODAY
Prices Vary in Same Towns,
it is Said—Various
Plans Suggested.
Washington, Dec. 29.—The federal
trade commission reopened hearings
today in its news print paper investi
gation, taking up the inquiry where
it was left off two weeks ago for study
of a distribution plant proposed by
paper manufacturers. The plant still
is under consideration.
The commission plans to present
again facts concerning cost of paper
manufacture aijd profits In news print
making. Publishers charge they are
paying exorbitant prices and that ar
tificial news print shortage has been
created by the diversion of news print
making machines to other classes of
work. Manufacturers have contended
that prices are reasonable and the
makers are priviledged to produce the
kind of paper that pays the largest
profits.
Under the distribution plan pro
posed all publishers woyld get a small
reduction on present prices, obtaining
the bulk of their supplies under an
agreement supervised by the com
mission by which large publishers
would relinquish a part of their nor
mal paper supply for next year.
Commissioner Da vies made it clear
that the commission was determined
to find some relief for the publishers.
He said the commission in the very
immediate future would decide wheth
er the distribution plans were feasi
ble. If it did not prove practicable
and the commission could find no
other measures of relief, he said, other
agencies of the government would be
given the facts uncovered by the
commission. A report will be made
to congress on the whole situation.
Some publishers thought Commis
sioner Davies referred to the depart
ment of justice when he spoke of
"other agencies" that might be called
in. Already the department Is in
vestlgating charges that manufactur
ers have combined to raise prices and
restrict production. Questions asked
of publishers indicated that the com
mission was in close touch with the
department of justice.
Representative Cramston of Michi
gan proposed that if It were not un
constitutional, the commission take
into its own hands the matter of price
and distribution.
Other publishers testified that prices
were widely different.
J. H. Zerbey of Pottsvllle, Pa., de
clared It all depended on who the
publisher was whether he could buy
in the open market.
C. S. Andrews, also of Pennsylvania,
declared his competitor in the same
town was able to buy paper cheaper
than he.
H. E. Trout of Pennsylvania said
some weeklies were paying ten cents
a pound for paper and that if present
prices continued all would have to go
out of business.

GERMANS STRIKE
BACK AT FRENCH
ON VERDUN UNE
Tried to Penetrate Lines
Between Hill 304 and
Dead Man Hill.
MACKENSEN PUSHES
AHEAD IN EAST
Braila, Important Provision
ing Point, Now Under
Fire.
Striking back at the French in the
Verdun, on the ba:ik of the Meuse
opposite the scene of the recent
French successes, the Germans made
a strong effort last night to penetrate
the French line between Hill 804 and
Dead Man Ilill, the two dominating
eminences northwest of the fortress.
According te Paris, the attack was
broken up, the Germans succeeding
in gaining a footing in only one
trench, south of .Dead Man Hill.
The activities around Verrliin vir
tually have been the only breaks in
the monotony of winter trench war
fare along the Franco-Relgian front.
The battle of the.Komme, admittedly
is in a state of suspense, because of
the bad state of the ground mid un
favorable atmospheric, conditions, ac
cording to British authority.
From Rumania where the real ac
tivity of the war now centers. Field
Marshal von Mackensen is keeping
up his thrust for the line of the Sereth
in Moldavia, driving the Russians be
fore him in none too good order, the
German reports intimate.
Latest accounts placed the left of
von Mackensen's line beyond Rininik
Sarat near the Bezcu-Fokshani rail
way line, while his right apparently
is drawing close to Krnila, at the
Danube end of the trunk line from
Buzeu.
Braila Under Fire.
Braila, important as a granary and
provisioning depot, itself is mean
while reported under fire from across
the Danube, where the Bulgarians,
with German and Turkish assistance,
aro vigorously assaulting the Matchiir
bridgehead. The apparent hope is to
clear Dobrudja completely of Rus
sians and effect a permanent junction
with the Teutonic forces in Wallachla
at a point where the lower Danube
will be closed completely to Russian
uses and the way open north of the
river for -a complete advance into
Bessarabia, just beyond which lies
Odessa. J.
The: latest* peace' move has been
made by Norway, Sweden and Den
mark, the three Scandinavian gov
ernments having sent a Joint note to
the belligerents supporting the peace
note of President Wilson.
Russians Win Violent Fight.
Petrograd, via London, Dec. 29.—
(British admiralty per Wireless

by the Russians.
Germans Advance.
Berlin, Dec. 29,— (By wireless.)—
The Germans advanced to the second

W. strike order, fostered and passed
not among the mill workers, mill of
ficials say, but among the local branch
of the I. W. W., failed of effect. As
soon as the pickets displayed flaring
red hills they were arrested.
"Kvery mill hand was at wgrk this

BERLIN PROPOSAL TO

Series of Conferences at

SOME OBJECTED TO
LENGTH OF NOTE
Unusual Optimism Shown
in London Over Final
Form of Rejoinder.
London, Dec. 29.—As a result of
tho conferences which havo been In
progress for several days, the entente
reply to the German note now is com
plete. it could go farward today or
tomorrow except for the noecssain
a it of an it in it to a
allies before final delivery. Thi.
means that the delivery will be made,
perhaps on Wednesday.
The delivery will be made at Paris,
after which the communication will
be forwarded to Germany througli
American channels. The reply is a
very long document, much more
lengthy than the German note. This
point has been one of the matters of
discussion among tho conferences, the
object having been raised that, it is
too long and should be short and
sharp. But there were so many points
of elucidation and such a. complete
difference of conception of the objects
and purposes for which the two sides
went into the war that it was found
desirable to extend the note to con
siderable length. The presence here
of Alexandre Ribot. the French fi
nance minister, permitted the French
ministry to be represented during the
conferences.
Unusual optimism is shown here as
a result of the final form which the
reply has taken, which is believed to
be such that it will meet with satis
fa.ction at Washington.
The reply to the American note will
follow within a few days after the
delivery of the reply to Germany.

AGREE ON BOND ISSUE
President Wilson and Administration
Leaders Tentatively Agree on
Plans to Meet Deficit.
Washington. Dec. 29.—President
Wilson tentatively has agreed with
administration leaders in congress on
treasury deficit, which confronts the
government for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1918, estimated at about
$180,000,000. With Secretary Mc
Adoo, the president is working on
other plans for raising additional
revenue.
The president has pointed out that
he believes a bond issue should be
made only to meet temporary and
emergency expenditures. Many of
these have been caused by the Mexi
can situation.
The'treasury already has authority
hy previous acts of congress to issue
Panama bonds and about J240.000,
000 of these are available. They
would bear three per cent.
Plans for raising the other revenue
are understood to concern the Income
tax and Inheritance tax and special
taxes on internal revenue and imports.

French Reserves Are not as
Strong, Says the London
Times Military Expert.
Russia Will Have New Ar

T-ondon, Dec. 29.—The Times mili
tary correspondent today calls for
greater British effort in the war. He
contends that although the French
are still strong, their reserves are less
numerous than could be wished for.
Russia, he adds, will bring new armies
into the field in 1917, but their use
fulness depends on their being pro
vided with heavy guns, airplanes and
mechanical transports, while Russia's
poor railway systems and other
causes point to the necessity of not
exaggerating what Russia can do.

easily increase her forces appreciably.
After admitting that Great Britain
has done a big share in the work at

"There are a. number of chances to
be effected before we can say we
are winning the war. Germany met
us in the autumn with 27 new di
visions and thereby secured a strategic
reserve which enabled her to con
duct the campaign in Rumania with
out disaster in the west. We must'
not only counter dispositions of this
character in time but must be be
forehand in the future. The reserves
of manhood In the British Isles and
dominions are ample for 30 divisions,
to expand munitions works and to
meet all legitimate demands of the
navy, the home defense and air serv
ices. Nearly four million men of mili
tary age are still in civil life. The
limit for new liability is still four
years below the standard and no an
swer has yet been made to the Ger
man auxiliary service act.
"What is needed is vigor in the
movement and a single minded de
termination to win the war. We have
a larger reserve of manhood than
Germany and the annual contingents
of youths in France and England to
gether are greater than the annual
contingents in Germany. It Is no
longer possible to think of winning
the war by half measures. The new
premier should state to the country
the measures necessary for victory
and stand or fall by them with the
courage we know him to possess."
