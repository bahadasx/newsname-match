..'The conference being held

regarding the putting into opera

The conference, which; has been
under way tdt Vbtht 'days, was re
sumed ye6terday( morning with
all concerned working in harmony
towards a settlement of the ques
tions at issue, those of wages and
hours.
A complete agreement and the
definite removal of the strike
danper had been practically an
nounced and the final disruption
came as a complete surprise.
The break came when the rail
rr ml men flatly refused to agree
to the suggestion of the trainmen
to put the eight hour wage scale
into effect immediately after the
first of the year, at the same time
putting the A dam son Law into
operation without waiting for the
result of the test of its constitu
tionality, now on in the Supreme
Court.
The leaders of the unions de
clared that in view of all the cir
cumstances the members of the
I ictherhoods are entitled to draw
tl:e benefits and wage increases
, lovided by the kill from the first
of January, or so soon as the law
becomes effective, regardless of
tne finding of the Supreme Court
as to the constitutionality of the
act.
RAILROADERS OBJECT
Representatives of the railroads
however, strenuously objected to
any such move. They asserted
that in all fairness to both sides,
the brotherhoods and the roads
themselves should await the ile-1
cision of the nation's highest tri
bunal. They also suggested that should
the Supreme Court decide in fav
or of the law that the controversy
between the railroads and their
employes be settled upon the
same basis that was used in the
award to the switchmen's union.
That union was given an increase
on a compromise basis.

WAHHINOTON, December L" -The
possibility of panting a Mibst itute

During the course of the discussion
it was suggested t hit t the money i-pcnt

The amount that probably will be
Axed under the substitute act will be
two oents for ea;h voter in thickly

designed as the result of scundnls that

Tlmr attitude has ivra. nit to 'a
number of specula Hani more or lest
worth while, but th gist of the official i
opinion in this city seems to be that
the "silence" policy of the President1
means that there is at present going1
forward a steady stream of secret ex
changes between the warring Powers
through the offt of the nation's execu
tive in the White House.
Becrecy May Hlp ' i
These officials poiut out that it is to
be expected that such a course would;
be followed, and diplomats declar
that in their ' opinion (iermany ia far
more likely to give better terms, pro
vided they can be kept secret for the
time being, than she would do if com
pelled to throw down her cards, face up
on the table.
.The tenseness of the situation is one
of the features that is becoming more
and more apparent. One insider, close
to the White House, yesterday declared
that Mr. Wilson is fully aware that
should the negotiations for peace now
fall through and come to nothing, the
I'nited States has much to dread from
the development of a submarine war
fare by the Teutonic Powers, which
"otild be more ruthless than anything
they have heretofore attempted. Oth
ers have confirmed this view and de
clared that the failure of the negotia
tions would undoubtedly mean aerions
difficulties for the I'nited States.
Teuton Eeplies Here
Austria's reply to the President 'a
note asking for terms has been received
at the state department and transmitted
to the White House at once. No hint
of. its contents was given oat by the
state department officials, bat it is un
derstood that it is practically identical
to the note from Berlin. The Berlin
note also arrived and was transmitted
to the President. It was declared that
Ambassador Gerard sent au confiden
tial communication with the note.
That Germany has an intention of
making President Wilson th medium
for tentative discussion of peace nego
tiations is understood in well-informed
circles here. It became known anil
widely commented upon, that Germany
will not permit the road to peace ne
gotiations to be blocked by a refusal
of the Entente Allies to enter into a
conference without a prior knowledge
of her terma.
In the diplomatic maneuvering which
has arisen, Germany is planning to so
handle her points as to secure a road
to the negotiations over the refusal of
the Entente Powers tu move until the
Teutons have given some concrete evi
dence of what they are prepared to do
toward bringing an eud to tho war aiU
justing International relation.
It had been forecast that the Kntente
group would base a refusal on the fact
that the German proposals are too
vague to receive consideration.
May Dlacloa Terms
The Teutons, it is understood, are
willing to permit a confidential ex
change .of broad, tentative terms
through President Wilson if necessary
to bridge the gap which now threatens
to prevent the assemblage of peace de
legates. Intimations have reached the
government that a statement of this
position will soon be communicated to
the lotted (States.

across the river from El Paso, .

and it is the one point rjpon which '
the American commissioners have
insisted upon. The United States r "
will not withdraw the troops sent
south of the border until that line
fa amply guaranteed against a re
newal of the bandit raids.
Senor Cabrera, who went to
Mexico with the text of the pro
tocol to submit the message to
the first chief himself, and get
his agreement or di:('tgreement,
presented the decision of General
Carranza to Mr. Lane, secretary
of the interior and one of the Am
erican peace commissioners, yes- ,
terday afternoon, but the two
commissioners did not discuss the
matter at all.
Confidants of the Mexican rep
resentative however, stated last
night that the gist of the Carranza
demands are that the United
States order Pershing and his men
back into American territory. "He
is willing to ratify the terms of
the protocol if the United States
government will but .name a def- .
inite date for the withdrawal of '
the troops'shc now lias south of
the border line," said this author
ity in speaking of the decision of
General Carranza. Another of
ficial says that "the door to nego
tiations has not been closed by
the Carranza reply."
It is understood that a joint ses
sion of the commission will be
held early next week, at which the
American representatives will re
ply to the Carranza demands.'
Meanwhile the situation in Mex
ico itself is growing worse again.
Villa is hammering the de facto
forces hard and his own are 'be
ing augmented rapidly from a var
iety of sources. He is declared to
be preparing to strike at Juarez
on the Rio firatule, across the in
ternational bridge from El Paso,
iu an effort to open the railroad
between the border line and the
city of Torreon, which he is, re
ported to have captured together
with a number of Carranza lead
ers, who he immediately executed.
