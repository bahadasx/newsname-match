A practical road system and grav

dollars a cord.
Salmon city is 2,000 cords a year.
A saving would be made of not less
than $4.000 annually by the construc
tion of a good wagon road four mUes
long This road would tap the tim
ber and enter a belt over which tim
her could be worked and hauled with
out expensive road construction. The

cords of wood to a road that would
require not more than four miles of
expensive construction work ~
main road to reach beyond the ob
structions that baffle the individual
wood haulers could be built for $4,000
the profits on one year's wood supply
under present demands. The expeu
iliture necessary to open up this
great resource would remain in the
county. Thousands of dollars which
now go to the railroads for freight
ami the coal monopolists would be
expended at home.
The forest service would, undoubt
edly, join in the opening up of the
lodgepole timber belts which could
cut under the federal rules. This
lodgepole timber is recognized as the
fuel product of this district. It is ex
ceptionally good fuel timber. It re
news itself in a short period, and the
foresi service considers it good pol
icy to cut the ripe timber. These im
mense Lemhi forests are in danger of
destruction by fire. A protected new
growth of timber on cut-over land
would be a better government asset
than the ripe forests of this district
w h ich require the expense of protec
non for long ages before there will
be any other fuel demand for this
class of timber.
The forest service would, probably
assist in the construction of roads to
open the timber which should be
sold at as early a period as possible.
The forest service would be qualified
io designate the tracts of timber that
should be cut for immediate use.
They, too, would select the routes for
road construction under a system of
cooperation with the fuel-users of
this community.
The firewood to be secured by a
system of roads to a lodgepole forest
would insure a better quality of fire
wood than is now furnished for con
sumption in Salmon. The improve
ment in quality without any saving in
price would justify the cost of the
good road system required. A good
sled road could be made for immedi
ate winter use in a few days by -b
men and five teams. The cost would
come back in wood before spring and
the money expended would all be
brought back to our business men
within the same period.

The mountain sheep is now rarely

a definite period, and the entire sun»
raised bears interest for the entire
life of the bond. The county, there
fore. pays Interest on the money so
borrowed and in addition sets aside
each year as a sinking fund an
amount sufficient to retire all the
bonds when they become due. The
sinking fund is deposited with banks
and earns some interest. This inter
est ordinarily is only 3 per cent,
whereas the county has to pay 5 or 6
per cent to its bondholders. The ser
ai plan is a much cheaper method of
raising money for road improvement,
even when the sinking fund earn in
terest as high as 4 per cent, and in
the opinion of the road specialists of
the department should be utilited
whenever it is possible to market
serial bonds.
In a study of the road bond issues
of several counties. J. E. Benny backer
and M. O. Eldridge, of the Public
Roads aud Rural Engineering, found
that the serial plan, if it had been
adopted by several counties, would
have saved the taxpayers in one coun
ty $154,269, in another county $80,702
and in a third county $65,367 over
the other plan with a sinking fund
bearing interest at 3 per cent. With
a sinking fund eurning 4 per cent, the
savings would have run as high as
i $72,288 in one of these counties

election. It Is likewise true that the
lawyers who managed to induce their
constituency to elect them to either
the senate or house, can be counted
on the fingers of the two hands. Un
like other legislatures, attorneys will
bq few and far between.
It will be up to the layman repre
sentatives to make the Ihws of this
state at the next session or to un
make many of those now on the sut
ute books which they consider ob
noxious. Farmers, business and pro
fessional men. will hold the leglsla
tlve opinion and direct the affairs
of the house and senate.
Fight Over Range Laws.
It is claimed the fight that develop
ed among the sheepmen and cattle
men over the enforcement of the two
mile limit law and the priority right
act, had much to do with the change
in the personnel of the legislature.
The sheepmen believe their indus
try should be given as much use of
the range as possible and they have
fought the priority right act for that
same reason. Both industries quiet
ly organized before the election The
result that followed may or may not
have been significant.
Lawyers Also Scarce.
The lawyers in both houses seem to
be just as scarce as those generally
classified as in sympathy with the
sheep industry. There are hut four
senators who are lawyers laiwe of
Cassia, Whitcomb of Lemhi, Randall
of Nee Perce and Thomas of Bing

Bates. Driscoll and Young of Ada, An
deraon of Canyon, McGowan of Latah
and Kiger of Kootenai
In point of service in the leglsla
ture there are striking few. Most of
the members are new. In the senai
the following were re-elected; lngard

of Cassia, Whitcomb of Lemhi, Thom
