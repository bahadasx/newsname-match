Chief Deputy.

MADE HUTSON'S AID
Cape Police Chief Will Assume
New Duties Next Monday
Ignores Contest.
Chief of Police J. X. Hutson, sheriff-fleet
of Cape County, announced
yesterday that he had appointed Wil
liam A. Summers, present incumbent
of the sheriff's office, and James Kow-
ard, boih of Jackson, his deputies.
They will be sworn in next Monday,
when he assumes his new duties.
Chief Hutson will retain his present
office of chief of police, and will re
mam in the Cape until his term as
chief expires. This will be on April
1. He will then move to Jackson,
where he will make his residence dur-
intr his incumbency as sheriff.
Mr. Summers, who will assist his j
.accessor, was elected four years ago.
He will be the chief deputy and at the J
same time jailer, until Chief Hutson
takes up his abode in the county seat.
Howard has been active in Demo-
cratic politics for a long number of!
vears. He was elected constable once, j
I jfot,i -,t iha ia5t -l.tioTi. I
He is well known in Cape County. j
It was known for some time that
Chief Hutson had selected these two
men as his deputies, but he did not
announce the appointments until he
received his commission as shtriff.
Chief Hutson received his creden-
despite the contest tiled by Henry
Bnnkopf, which bnenn nutson con- ;
siders a joke. j
The election ol uiiei nuison
decided by only a small margin, nis
majority over Brinkopf, the Repub
lican candidate, was 49 votes, accord
ing to the official count. Brinkopf
liled a suit to contest the election of
Mr. Hutson, but the case has not been
set for tiial. Even Republicans be
lieve if a discrepancy were shown it
would only increase Mr. Hutson's lead.
Chief Hutson iaid that Mr. Sum
mers will look after the sheriff's du
ties in Jackson until Hutson's term
as police chief expires. In all proba
bility, the chief faid, he will take
charge of the jail after that time and
have Summers attend to the sheriff
matters in the Common Tleas Court
of Cape Girardeau.
MAYOR TO ACCEPT WISHES
OF PEOPLE ON WOOD BLOCKS
Repairs Made in Streets Damaged by
the Water Tuesday
Night.
The wooden blocks washed loose by
the heavy downpour Tuesday night
will not be relaid, Mayor Kage said
last night, until the property owners
have decided what they prefer to do.
In all places along Broadway where
the water tore deep holes in the
street, the blocks will be removed so
that the concrete base beneath the
blocks will be exposed. The blocks
between the tracks, however, will re
main. In several other streets, where the
w.-itM- caused similar damage, tha,
wooden blocks were relaid yesterday.
A gang of men were kept busy re
pairing the damaged places. At the
intersection on Independence and
Spanish streets, where the flood rose
over the sidewalks and dug deep holes
in the street, the blocks were placed
back in the street. The same was done
at Themis and Spanish street. There
will be no action taken in the matter
of repaving the business streets until
the property owners have come to an
understanding. At a meeting held by
those who own property along Main j Miss Frieda Haupt has been chosen
' . - .nmm;ttn was named to!tl.p bridesmaid, while Mr. George
circulate a petition among the proper
ty owners, . asking for a concrete
street.
It is said "that a number of the
property owners are against. the re
paving of the streets .unles the city
defrays a part of the expenses.-.
