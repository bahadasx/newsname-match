At the meeting of the good roads
volunteers, held at the city hall last
night, Capt. Hollingsworth announced
the appointment of the above list of
lieutenants, each to have charge of the
construction of one mile of the Chicka-sha-Cement
Oil Fields Highway.
The mobilizing: points of the com
mands of the various lieutenants next
Monday morning were also designated,
as above stated. The "orders of the
day" call for all volunteers to start
promptly at 6 p. m., and to take their
dinners with them in order that a full
day's work may be put in on the
roads. The volunteers and equipment
will be divided among the various
bands.
"Our plan is to start at the county
line and work this way," said Captain
Hollingsworth. "We do this for sev-
One Is that we have
organized the farmers along the first
eleven miles, beginning with the coun
ty line, and they will be on the ground
ea-iy with men, teams and equipment.
Another is that we have the assurance
that the county commissioners will
take care of the road between here and
orge. Mr. Robinson is now working
on the road running west, south of
the Country club, and his successor,
Mr. Temple, has given the assurance
that this work will be completed. We
have therefore arranged to devote our
first day to the road beyond Norge and
later ork toward Chickasha. The
work is now up to the Meutenants and
we expect, every man to do his duty.
If we fall down on this undertaking,
we might as well quit inking about
good roads. If we succeed, my ouiii
ion is that it won't be long before we
build good roads in the same manner
in every direction from Chickasha
Every man in Chickasha must, do his
part and show the farmers that Chick
asha is with them."
In addition to the lieutenants, a com
mittee on transportation was appoint
ed, with Ben Johnson as chairman, the
other members being E. G. Reynolds,
II. E. Martin, and Conde MoGinely
Mr Johr.non called a meeting of this
committee for an early hour this morn

large number of cars will be needed
for this purpose and it Is hoped that
the motorists of the city will cheer
fully respond to the call that will be
made.
A eood sized crowd attended the
mooting at the city hall last night and
Jonas Cook acted as presiding officer.
At the opening Rev. John A. Wray was
caiiled upon to deliver the funeral ora
tion of Old Man Indifference whose
demise was made known when a
hearse, followed by musicians playing
a dirge, was drawn through the streets
shortly after 6 o'clock. Dr. Wray de
clared that the deceased was simply
a "defaulter in citizenship." Old In
difference was always too busy or too
selfish to do anything for the good of
the community ho was even worse
than a knocker.
The crowd burst into applause when
a party ot high school boys, lead by
Prof. Morrow, entered the room, bear
ing a banner which said, "We have our
shovels ready" and "The high school
boys will bo on the job Jan. 1." The
hoys were assigned to heavy duty on
the far end of the road.
Enthusiasm was also created when
the Rock Island shopmen arrived and
Herb Powell announced that they will
be on the job Monday.
On call of Capt. Hollingsworth, a
number of volunteers were added to
the list. President G. W. Austin said
the O. C.'W. wanted to help out and
announced a donation of $10. Mayor
Cof' mn aviv.tnced that the e;ty coun
cil had just authorized Street Commis
sioner Dan Beets to use his entire out-
ill In the work next week.
Funeral Announced
Late yesterday afternoon a circular
was distributed on the streets, bear-
inS tne
following information:
our most prominent citizens.
Funeral this p. m. at 5:3() o'clock.
Citizens are urged to attend this fa
neral of one who in the last few years
has been a most predominating citi
zen. Old Man Indifference is the citizen
that Chickasha is losing today.
"There will be no mourners tat this
funeral the old man has lost all his
friends in Chickasha. There is no sor
row caused by the demise of this
worthless party.
"We are all glad to see that he has
lost his influence on our good ('.'. . :
ship. "In the last few years this man has
ruined the success of many good pro
gressive moves in our city. He has
kept us from pushing Chickasha to the
front on many occasions.
"Funeral procession will pass down
Chickasha avenue this p. m. at 5:30.
"Rev. A. Wray will conduct the fun
eral services tonight .at the city hall
and we hope that all our citizens who
appreciate the death of this old gent
will be present.
"The deceased will be burled next
Monday, January 1, on the Chiekasha
Cement Oil Fields Highway. The ser
vices will take only a short bit of our
time. Then the Cement Oil Fields
Highway proposition will be taken up.
We need no money on this but hope
every man living in Chickasha who
has an ounce of 'PEP' and wants to
see Chickasha grow will be there."

Danger of Ereak Between United States
and Germany Over Submarine War
fare is Recognized
GERMANY INSINCERE IN
DEALING WITH U. S.
Washington Will Consent to Act as Mes
senger in Order to Assist Peace
Dove to Alight
By United Press.
Washington, Dee. 29 If Germany
desires that the United States pass
along secret terms for the entente
allies to consider at a round table ses
sion, this government will lend itself
to the proceedings. High state, depart
ment officials said this much today
but qualified their remarks by empha
sizing the fact that the United States
will act "merely as a messenger." Any
communication handled between the
belligerents would he kept secret if
the power transmitting it so requested.
The idea of a break with Germany
over the submarine issue if the peace
proposal fails is now generally held
here. Some administration men say
privately that tho German answer to
the president's peace proposal is in
sincere. They see little hope of the al
lies meeting the German proposals and
fear the resumption of "unbridled sub
marine warfare," following the' fail
ure of the present negotiations.
One of the many interpretations
placed upon the peace notes briefly is
that it is now wholly up to Germany
whether this government remains neu
tral or casts its lot with the allies. The
deepest kind of secrecy is maintained
regarding developments at this state
of the game.

They hail the mayor going at the
city council meeting last night, and
Tor tho first time since becoming may
or hi;- honor had to cast the deciding
vote when J. C. Rlckerts was appointed
plumbing inspector.
The ordinance having been read with
the emergency clause creating the of
fice and fixing the maximum fees
which might be charged, the appoint
ment of an inspec tor was next in or
der. It was believed until yesterday
that A. L. Hollingsworth, mail carrier,
would be the only applicant until yes
terday when the name of J. C. Rick
erts or tho firm of Boone & Rickerts,
loomed on the horizon. Both applica
tions were sent in last night. Both, it
was decided, were competent men and
it then became a question of expe
diency, of who could. handle the work
with tho least inconvenience to plumb
ers and property owners.
Mayor Coffman said he would ap
boint tho man whom the council fav
ored and a straw vote was taken. Tho
count was three and three.. "Gentle
men, you've got me up a stump."
said the mavor. Then he consulted
the credentials of the tv.b men and an-1
nounced that, owing to Hollingsworth
being tied up w'ith the postoffice with
certain hours which must bo given to
federal service and that Rickerts was
comparatively free to go and come at
any time, he would appoint the latter.
Plumbing Inspector Rickerts spent
several years as a plumber In Indian
apolis before coming to Chickasha. He
will have several large inspections to
make in the near future, one of which
the McFarland hotel, will give him an
$18 fee, there being thirty-six pieces
of new plumbing work to pass ion.
During the discussion the wording of
the ordinance was changed so as to
make It read now plumbing work In
stead of all plumbing work, although
one councilman suggested that many
landlords would prefer to pay the fifty
cent fee to know that any repair work
was well done.

Many private parties aro doing the

should not wait shows that it has boon
making some money.
. Already 1800 tax receipts have been
written and given to taxpayers since
December 1. This represents a col
Joction of over $50,000 over the count
er. Besides this there are checks sent
in advance aggregating at least $50,00
for which receipts have not been is
sued. Tho law provides, however,
that no penally attaches to payments
for which checks have boon sent to tho
cojunty treasurer before January 1,
even though receipts are not Issued
before that date.

Ordinance Repealing $1 License Held Up
for Amendment of Law Requiring
Examination Fee
Another respite of two weeks is giv
en to automobile drivers who have not
stood an examination or procured city
licenses for their cars. It will require
another session of the city council to
decide what tho members want to do
In the premises. Conflicting opinions
wore expressed last night as to the
advisability of omitting tho seventy
fivo cents examination fee hut all wore
agreed that the local automobile own
ers should not be required to pay the
$1 license.
An ordinance was road to the effect
"that part of section 13 ardinanee No.
i 11) requiring und providing a fee of $1
for a license to run, drive or propel a
motor vehicle" etc., be and here is,
i
hereby repealed. Also, that "this ordi
nance Is not Intended to repeal nny
other part of said ordinance No. -1(9"
and that all foes collected since July
1, 1915, for licenses bo refunded to tho
parties paying the same, provided sue h
parties apply to tho city dork for such
refund before July 1, 1917, and trat the
mayor and city clerk bo authorized to
draw warrants on the contingent and
supply fund for said amounts.
"Examination a Farce
Thc discussion was precipitated by
Councilman Lorensen when he assert
ed that in his opinion the examination
and attendant payment of a fee of
seventy-five cents was a farce and rec
ommended that no such examination
fee bo required. He cited a case, with
out giving his authority, of a man who
had secured four such examination cer
tificates without proper procedure.
This statement was challenged by
Councilman DuBose but Lorensen re
fused to give his authority saying,
however, "that his informant was a
well known man on Chickasha avenue.
Some of the councllmen stated that if
this were true the guilty party should
be removed from the board of exami
ners. Mayor Coffman then remarked that
he did not believe that a member of
the board should bo entitled to the fee
unles3 he actually made the examina
tion called for. The simple act of
signing his name to the certificate of;
a person whom ho knew could drive J
without a specific demonstration did i
not, In his opinion, call for such a fee.
Councilman Linn favored the removal
of this fee altogether. Ho believed
that some city official could make this
examination without extra charge to
the appliant.
The bill was then referred oack to
tho ordinance committee to be amend
ed, though in what particular regard
was not made clear in the discussion.

Berlin. Dec. 29 Judging from un

That, tho war will not enu without
the allies making another gigantic

When tho battles begla he peace
talk will probably subside to await the
outcome of bitter struggles. It Is be
