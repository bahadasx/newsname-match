NEW LOGGING CAMP
IS IN PROSPECT
H. B. & A. Comitanv Plan t lUxrin
Operations Near Yankton.
The Holland, Brlggs & Avery Log
:lng Company will, In the near fu
ture, establish a large logging camp
on Milton creek, a short distance
from Yankton, provided they ca"n se
cure right of way from several par
ties who are now In controversy with
them. Should the canm be estab
lished It will give employment to at
least 76 men, and will operate for
somo time, the concern having large
timber holdings In that vicinity. It
Is planned to make an extension from
Looman'a crpBalng. on thq UHelens
uumner company's railroad, up Mil
ton creek for a distance of about four
miles. The end of the road will be
near the Charles Wallace olae.
where the company's timber Is lo
cated. It Is understood that tho nnlv
obstacle In the way at the present
time, is the fact that several persons
owning land over which the logging
company wishes to cross are holding
back consent. It is hoped that a com
promise settlement can be arrived at,
for the employment of another -75
to 100 men in a permanent enter
prise would be of benefit to the en
tire community, and thoce employes
of the St. Helens Lumber Company
who are temporarily out of work on
account of the clouing of the camn
would be able to find employment Im
mediately and their work be near
their homes.

MAN KILLS WIFE
THEN COMMITS SUICIDE
Tragedy (Krurs at Kainler Tuewlay
Afternoon.
Brooding over the fact that his
wife had recently instituted divorce
proceedings against him, W. J. Hor
ton, a logger, Tuesday afternoon at
Rainier, killed his wife, Sarah J.
Morton, and then turning the weannn
on himself sent a -bullet through his
head. Both the man and his vletlm
fell unconscious, Horton dying in less
than two hours and the woman lin
gered for four hours. Both of them
were unconscious so no direct state
ments could be obtained. The shoot
ing occurred in the store of W. S.
Cobb & Co., which Is Just opposite
the S. P. & S. depot, immediately
after the arrival of the boat from
iveiao, on which Horton came to
Rainier. Evidently Horton had his
mind made up as to what he would
do and how quickly he would do it.
for he walked directly to the store,
where his wife was employed, and
without a word shot the woman.
The woman had recently filed a di
vorce suit against Horton, and on
the summons, which was found on
the body of the man, he had written
a short note which stated in effect
that he could not live without his
wife and. therefore had decided to
kill both himself and her. Another
note found on the man's body was
addressed to his son, Troy Horton,
and dated on Christmas day,' In
structing the son to collect certain
moneys due Horton and wound up
by saying that he had worried over
the divorce suit so much that he
could stand It no longer and the son
would probably not see him aeain.
: .When Horton arrived from. -Kelso, L
where he has a brother, Bud Horton,
a wealthy shiooinK mnn. lin Rtnnri
for a few minutes before the harher
jhop where the manager of the Cobb
store was getting shaved, apparently
to make sure that the manager of
the store was not in his place of
business. When he recognized the
mnnager, ho at once proceeded to the
toie and the tragedy followed with
in a few seconds.
Earlier In the day Mrs. Horton
told a woman friend that her hus
band had, on the preceding day, be
fore going to Kelro, threatened to
return yesterday and kill her.
Both had been previously married.
Horton had one son, Troy, as the re
sult of the former marrincn unit
Mrs. Horton had three children, Ray,
Guy and Myrtle Wlsecup, aged 22, 16
and 10 years respectively, the issue
of the former union. Troy Horton
was In Stella, Wash., where his
father had been at work recently,
since he and his wife separated last
October, and Mrs. Horton's children
were also away from town.
Mr. and Mrs. Horton formerly con
ducted a lodging house in Portland.
The woman was clerk of the Women
of Woodcraft. Mrs. Horton 'had held
a position in the Cobb store since
October and she had but recently
applied for a divorce, and this is be
lieved to have worked on the man's
mind to such an extent that he be
came temporarily deranged.
The fuuerals of both victims of the
tragedy were held Thursday.
