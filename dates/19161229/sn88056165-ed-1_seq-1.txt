TO EXTEND
STATE HIGHWAY
Southern Counties Plän to
' Connect With Oregon and
Nevada and Tap Lincoln
Highway to California.
State Highway Engineer Booth
who reached th^ city yesterday
from Boise, brings the informa
tion of a further important de
velopment in connection with the
north and south state highway.
The development applies to plans
now receiving initial attention
for connecting the highway with
a link to run through Oregon and
Winnemucca into Nevada and
there connecting with the Lin
coln highway affording a con
venient route into California.
The movement organized at
Caldwell. The north and south
road reaches Caldwell after pass
ing through Weiser. The people
of the northwestern section of
Owyhee county are joining with
the Caldwell people for a thirty
mile road from Caldwell that will
reach the Oregon line, here strik
ing Malhuer county. The people
of the latter county are organiz
ing to carry the road through
that country to the Nevada line,
when the Winnemucca people
will promote the construction
to connection with the Lincoln
highway.
The plans have proceeded to
such a point that in the early
spring, Engineer Booth will,
with Malhuer county and Win
nemucca people, make a trip over
the route.
Mr. Booth will - spend about a
week in Lewiston and vicinity.
While here he will meet the
commissioners of the Lapwai and
Clearwater highway districts and
wiil also make an inspection of
the progress of work on the Lew
iston Hill state highway.—Mon
days Tribune.
Break Convict Camp Friday
County Commissioner John D..
Long was notified yesterday by
Engineer Hazzard, in charge of
the convict camp at White Bird,
where they have been working
this season on the North and
South highway, that camp would
be broken there Friday morning
and the men would start at once
on their trip to southern Idaho.
Mr. Hazzard stated that the work
on the road would be completed
today and that the funds having
been exhausted they would not
be able to remain longer. The
engineers made a decidedly in
accurate estimate on the cost of
the construction of the road from
White Bird to the ferry, after
wards revising the first estifnate
a time or two without arriving at
a correct conclusion. As is now
being left, there is really no con
nection with the new road from
White Bird and it still requires a
considerable sum of money to
complete it in shape for heavy
hauling, as it will be necessary
to put a bridge across White Bird
creek.—Globe.
W. B. Hussman, J. F. Jenny
and August Schroeder were pas
sengers for Grangeville Wednes
day evening to attend the good
roads meeting held at that place
yesterday. Ed. Blake also went
over to represent the Keuter
ville district.
This is the last week in which
taxes for the present year can be
paid and if you have not already
taken care of your taxes it is
high time to do so. Half of the
taxes may be paid at this time
and the remaining half before
the first Monday in July.
Sign for New Lyceum Course
Miss B. Mawrence, business
representative of the Redpath
Lyceum bureau, was in the city
yesterday and closed a contract
last evening with the commercial
club for a lyceum course for the
winter of 1917-18. The numbers
of the present course have prov
en so highly satisfactory that the
club had little hesitancy in con
tracting for a course for next
winter, and by so doing will
bring to Cottonwood some of the
finest musical and educational
talent in the entire country,
which many of our people would
otherwise not have an opportu
nity of hearing.
The course contracted for yes
terday consists of the following
numbers: The Ada Roach com
pany of six people in a light op
eretta, "The Heart of the Emi
grant," the Means-Anderson
trio, the Homeland male quar
tette, the St. Clair sisters and
Rollo McBride, lecturer. These
are some exceptionally fine num
bers and are sure to please the
local public. Season tickets will
be placed on sale early in the
summer.
Another Trusty Goes Wrong
One of the convicts from the
road camp known in White Bird
as "Happy," a name adopted by
himself, for some reason un
known to the good people of
White Bird, last week forged the
name of one of the Salmon River
State Bank's customers, which
was detected when presented to
the bank, the same being passed
on a party in Grangeville.
The White Bird bank is a mem
ber of the American Bankers'
Association, which has the ser
vices of the Burns Detective
Agency to look after all depreda
tions, against member banks.
"Happy" will no doubt be re
turned to Boise for safe keeping.
Dr. Macneill of this place, ac
cepted the check which was
forged with the name of C. M.
Cone and endorsed by "Happy,"
for professional services. But
the forgery did not get further
than the cashier's window.—
Globe.
Wanted Back in the Pen
While Miss Freda Hesterman
was on her way down town Sun
day night from her home in the
east part of town, a young man
rushed up to her when she had
reached main street, and snatch
ing her purse, ran around the
corner of the Imperial Hotel
north, and disappeared from
sight, The sheriff's office was
notified and in a short time the
offender was apprehended. He
proved to be one of the men re
cently released from the convict
camp at Whitebird, by the name
of E. V. Hocum, and when ques
tioned af to the offense, admitted
that he had taken the purse and
said he did it to get back into
the penitentiary, as he had found
it harder to get along outside
than in. He is now in the coun
ty jail.—Grangeville Globe.
Mrs. John Aichlmayr is report
quite ill at her home in the north
end of town.
E. E. Hale and Nick Bieren
joined the list of Chronicle read
ers this week.
The Camas Prairie Railway
company is preparing to erect a
commodious section house here
for the benefit of its men. The
house will be built of tile and
brick.
The electric power has been
very poor again this week and
part of the time the mills were
unable to operate. It looks very
much like a case of too much
load for the plant.

Christmas Tree a Success
The community Christmas tree
and entertainment given last
Sunday evening at the K. of C.
hall proved a complete success
in every sense of the word. The
big hall was filled to full capacity
at an early hour and the moving
picture program was thoroughly
enjoyed. Afterward the special
Christmas program was rendered
and the recitations, music and
songs met with rounds of ap
plause, the selections of the male
quartet meeting with especial ap
proval. - The tree was beauti
fully decorated and was aglow
from top to bottom with colored
electric lights and when old
Santa appeared on the scene
the little folks went wild with
excitement and joy. Following
the distribution of gifts from the
tree, packages of candy, fruit
and nuts were presented to each
child as the crowd left the hall
and many hearts were thereby
made happy that otherwise
might have thought Christmas
nought but an empty name.
Mrs. Mills and Mary Byam
came up from Kamiah late last
week and are spending the week
here visiting at the home of Mr.
and Mrs. Boyce.
Bills are now out announcing
a big dance on the night of Janu
ary 8th. Music will be furnished
by the popular Reubens orches
tra and a fine time is promised
all who attend. As this will be
the first dance since Thanksgiv
ing it should be well attended.
Idaho Regiment at Boise
Boise, Dec. 23.—The Second
Idaho regiment which returned
to Boise today from Nogales
where six months were spent in
border duty was given a noisy,
enthusiastic welcome by thous
ands of people. Tonight the reg
iment is comfortably quartered
in the buildings at the Boise bar
racks. The first battalion arriv
ât 3:55 o'clock, the second a half
hour later and the third in the
evening. Officers and enlisted
men look the picture of health.
There is not a man on the hospit
al list. From the warm climate
of the border they traveled across
Idaho today in a mild December
snow storm. The regiment will
be held here for demobilization
until after the convening of the
legislature Jan. 9th.
Whistles screamed, bells rang
and shouts from the multitude of
people at the Oregon Short Line
depot greeted the returning sol
diers. As each battalion arrived
it marched through a dense mass
of people in the business section
of the city, to the stirring music
of the regimental band. Thun
derous cheers greeted them. Of
ficers and enlisted men declare
they are as happy to be home as
Idahoans are to see them. There
has been no military demonstra
tion like the one in Boise today
for many years.
Program a Grand Success
The Christmas program given
at the Stock Creek school Satur
day night was a success in every
sense of the word and was very
well attended.
The teacher, Miss E. Booth,
must be complimented on her un
tiring effort in the training of
the pupils, the program having
proved in every way the skill of
the teacher and was appreciated
by all. The decorations were
also beautiful.
Mr. R. S. Curless pleased the
audience very much with his
humorous talks and songs, while
the songs by Miss Caroline Ter
haar were delightful.
The big tree loaded with pres
ents were a source of joy to the
many little folks, while Santa
Claus came in for his share of
amusement after scrambling
down the chimney and filling the
row of gaping stockings.
Barber Kills Fellow Employe
Portland, Ore., Dec. 25.—W.
A. Shaner, a barber, was shot
and killed at his chair in a large
shop here today by W. A. Mc
Call, another barber who had
been discharged and who attri
buted his trouble to Shaner. Mc
Call surrendered himself at the
county jail.
The McCall above mentioned is
without doubt the same man who
was formerly employed at the
Weigand barber shop in this city.
He left for Portland about a year
ago.

resident of Idaho since 1891 and

ing wood. In some manner he

while descending the mountain
and his back was injured and a

head.
A party of Genesee hunters
returned home last week from
the Big Island country and
brought in nine deer and four
cougar hides. Two of the hun
ters remained in the woods for
more cougar and one hide was
also left at camp by the return
ing hunters. This is the most
game ever brought into Genesee
and the largest kill reported this
season. The five hunters were
absent less than three weeks.
A check for $5,000 donated by
Timothy Regan and another for

The pardon applications of O.
V. Allen, defaulting former state
treasurer, and Fred Coleman,
former deputy state treasurer,
were both denied by the pardon
board at Boise late last week.
The board voted unanimously
against the Allen pardon and At
torney Ceneral Peterson was the
only one who voted in favor of
Coleman. Pardons were granted
Jack Dillion, of Wallace; Lee
Harvey, of Power county; Ross
Benson, of Power county and
Miami Roes, of Albion.
Coleman Now Be Paroled
Boise, Dec. 22. — The state
board of pardons today recon
sidered the application of Fred
Coleman, former defaulting dep
uty state treasurer who confessed
to the embezzlement of $22,000
for which he is serving time in
the state penitentiary, and will
release him in February. This
was accomplished by fixing his
sentence at two and a half years.
Coleman was sentenced Decem
ber 26, 1914, to from two and a
half to ten years. By fixing his
sentence after serving the mini
mum he will serve but another
month. Good time accounts for
the minimum expiring then.
The entire board refused to
pardon either Coleman or Allen,
defaulting treasurer, yesterday.
Today it denied Allen a parole.
Secretary of State Barker asked
consideration of the Coleman
case on the grounds he thought
he was entitled to leniency for
helping the state trace the falsi
fied treasury book "'records so
that it could recover losses from
the looting of the treasury. He
moved to fix the sentence and
voted to do so with Attorney
General Peterson. Gov. Alex
ander voted against it. The
Coleman confession two years
ago created a state-wide sensa
tion, as did Allen's.
The board also granted a par
don to Joseph Siciliano, sentenced
from Bannock county for second
degree murder to serve from 35
years to life. He started service
of sentence January 14, 1914.
Siciliano murdered a fellow
countryman in a restaurant at
Pocatello.
