Washington, I)ec. 21. President
Wilson's notes to the belligerents
are prefaced with this Instruction by
Secretary Lansing to the American
ambassadors presenting them:
The President directs me to send
you the following communication to
be presented immediately to the min
isters of foreign affairs ot the govern
ment of which they are accredited:"
The texts of the notes themselves
then begin identically as follows:
"Tho President of the United
States has Instructed me to suggest
to the (here Inserted a designation of
the government addressed) a course of
action with regard to the present war
which we hope that the government
will take under consideration as sug
gested In the most friendly spirit
and as coming not only from a friend
but also as coming from the repre
sentative of a neutral nation whose
interests have been most seriously af
fected by the war and whose concern
for Us early conclusion arises out ot
a manifest necessity to determine
how best to safeguard those interests,
It the war is to continue."
At this point the context varies. In
the notes to the central powers this
paragraph follows next:
"The suggestion which I am in
structed to make, the President has
long had It in mind to offer. He Is
somewhat . embarrassed to offer it at
this particular time because It nay
now seem to have been prompted by
a desire to play a part in connection
with the recent overtures of the cen
tral powers. It has. In tact, been in
no way suggested by them In Its
origin and the President would have
delayed offering It until those over
tures had been independently aa
swered but for the fact that it also
concerns the question of peace and
may best be considered in connection
with other proposals which have the
same end in view. The President can
only beg that his suggestion bo con
sidered entirely on its merits, and as
I' it had been made in other circum
stances.
In the note to the entente allies
the following paragraph takes the
place of the one Just quoted:
'The suggestion which I am In
structed to make, the President has
long had It in mind to offer. Ho
somewhat embarrassed to offer it at
this particular time because it may
now seem to have been prompted by
the recent overtures of the central
powers. It Is, in fact, in no way nsso
elated with them in its origin and the
President would have delayed offer
ing It until these overtures had been
answered but for tho fact that It also
concerns the question ot peace and
may best be considered In connection
with other proposals which have the
same end In view. The President can
only beg that his suggestion be con
sidered entirely on its own merits
and as it it had been made in other
circumstances."
Then all the notes proceed Identical
ly as follows:
The President suggests that an
early occasion be sought to call out
from all the nations now at war such
an avowal of their respective views as
to the terms upon which the war
might bo concluded and the arrange
ment which would he deemed satis
factory as a guaranty against its re
newal or the kindling ot any similar
conflict In the future as would make
It possible frankly to compare them.
"He Is Indifferent as to the means
taken to accomplish this. He would
be happy himself to serve, or even
to take the Initiative in Its accom
plishment In any way that might
t rove acceptable, but he has no de
sire to determine the method or the
Instrumentality. One way will be as
acceptable to him as another, If only
the great object he has In mind be attained.
He takes the liberty of calling at
tention to the fact that the objects
which the statesmen ot the belliger
ents on both sides have tn mind In
this war are virtually the same, as

stated la general terms to their awn
people and to the world.
Each side desires to snake tho
rights sad privileges of weak peoples
and small states si secure against ag
gression or denial Is the future as the
rights and privileges of the great and
powerful atatea now at war. Each
wishes Itself to be made secure In the
future, along with all other nations
and peoples, against the recurrence of
wars like this and against aggression
ot selfish interference ot any kind.
Each would be Jealous of the
formation of any more rival leagues
to preserve an uncertain balance of
power amidst multiplying suspicions;
but each Is ready to consider th
formation of a league of nations to
insure peace and justice throughout
the world.
Before that final step can be taken.
however, each deems It necessary
first to settle the iswues of the pres
ent war upon terms whieh will cer
lainly safeguard the independence, the
territorial Integrity and the political
and commercial freedom ot the na
tions involved.
"In the meapures to be taken to se
cure the future peace of the world
the people and government of the
t'nited Slates are as vitally and as
directly interested as the governments
now at war. Their interest, moreover,
in the means to be a loptcd to relieve
the smaller ami weaker peoples of the
world ot the peril of wrong and vio
lence is as quick aod ardent as that
ot any other people or government.
They stand ready, and even eager, to
cooperate In the accomplishment ot
these ends, when thé war Is over, with
every influence and resource at their
command. But the war must first be
concluded.
The terms upon which it Is to be
concluded they are not at liberty to
suggest: but the President does feel
that It is his right and his duty to
point out their Intimate Interests in
Its conclusion, lest it should presently
be too late to accomplish the greater
things which lie beyond Its conclusion
lest the situation of neutral nations,
now exceedingly hard to endure, be
rendered altogether intolerable, and
lest, more than all. an Injury be done
civilization Itself which can never be
atoned for or repaired.
"The President therefore feels alto
gether justified in uoggesling an im
mediate opportunity for a comparison
ot views as to the terms which must
precede those ultímale arrangements
for the peace of the world, which all
desire and in which the neutral na
tions as well as those at war are
ready to play their full, responsible
part.
If the contest must continue to
nroceed toward undefined ends by
slow attrition until fne one group of
belligerents or the other Is exhausted,
if million after million of human lives
must continue to be offered up until
on the one Bide or the other there are
no more to offer, If resentments must
be kindled that can never cool and
despairs engendered from whieh there
can be no recovery, hopes of peace
and of the willing concert of free peo
ples will be rendered vain and idle,
"The life of the entire world has
been profoundly affected. Every part
of the ureat family of mankind has
felt the burden and terror of this un
precedented contest of arms. No na
tion in the civilized world can be said
in truth to stand out to its Influence
or to be safe against its disturbing
effects. And yet the concrete objects
for which it !b being waged have
never been definitely stated.
"The leaders of tho several belliger
ents have, as has been Baid, staled
those objects In general terms. Hut
stated In general terms, they seem
the same on both Bides. Never yet
have the authoritative spokesmen
either side avowed the precise object
which would. If attained, satisfy them
and their people that the war had
been fought out. The world has been
left to conjecture what definitive re
sults, what actual exchange of guar
antles, what political or territorial
changes or readjustments, what stage
ot military success, even, would bring
the war to an end.
"It may bo that peace Is nearer than
we know; that the terms which the
belligerents on tho one Bide and on
tho other would deem It necessary to
insist upon are not bo irreconcilable
as some have feared; that an Inter
change of views would clear the way
at least for conference and make the
permanent concord of the nations a
liope of the Immediate future, a con
cert ot nations Immediately practicable.
"The President Is not proposing
peace; he is not even offering media
tion. He Is merely proposing that
soundings be taken In order that we
may learn, the neutral nations with
the belligerent, how near the haven
of peace may be tor which all man
kind longs with an intense and In
creasing longing.
"He believes that the spirit In
which be speaks and the objects
which be seeks will be understood by
all concerned, and he confidently
hopes for a response which will bring
a new light Into the affairs of tho
world."
The note to the entcoto group will

LOVINGTON,
N. Me
Washington, Dec. 22 The possibility
that the I nlted States might soon be
drawn Into the war In defense of Its
rights wa.. the principal consideration
moving President Wilson to address
his peaee appeal t the belligerents
asking them to state the conditions on
which the would be willing to end
the conflict.
In order to guide the United States
In determining whether It shall enter
tho war, the President desires to
know whether there Is any prospect of
peace, or only the prospect of a con
tlnuatlon of the struggle with unmttt
ated aggressions upon American
rights by the belligerents.
The President, however, does not
now contemplate plunging the nation
Into the war, although that may be
the eventual result if the war contin
ues and tho belligerents do not cease
their aggressions.
At the same time the President does
not wish the belligerents to conceive
the Idea that the United States ut
tered a threat to enter the war when
he claimed the right to address the
belligerents "lest the situation of neu
tral nations, now exceedingly hard to
endure, be rendered altogether Intolerable."
If necessary to disabuse the minds
of tho belligerents of any notion that
thrent of war Is thus conveyed, the
President will send them another note
further explaining his attitude.
The first statement Issued by Mr.
Lansing follows:
"The reasons for the sending of the
note were as follows:
It Is not our material Interest we
had in mind when the note was sent,
but more and more our own rights are
becoming Involved by the belligerents
on both sides, so that the situation is
becoming Increasingly critical.
"1 mean by that, that we are draw
ing nearer the verge of war ourselves,
anil therefore, we are entitled to
know oractly what each belligerent
seeks, In order that we may regulate
our conduct in the future.
"No nation has been sounded. No
consideration of the German over
tures or of tho speech of Lloyd-George
was taken Into account In the for
mulation of the document. The only
thing the overtures did was to delay
it a few days. It was not decided to
send until Monday. Of course, the dif
ficulties that face the President were
that It might be construed as a move
ment toward peace and in aid of the
German overtures. He specifically
denies that that was the fact in the
document itself.
"The sending of this noto w ill Indi
cate the possibility of our being forced
Into the war. That possibility ought
to serve ns a restraining and sobering
force, safeguarding American rights.
It may also serve to force an earlier
conclusion of the war. Neither the
President nor myself regards this
note as a peace note; It Is merely an
effort to get the belligerents to de
fine the end for which they are fight
ing." These were tho explanations of the
President's peace move emanating
from Secretary ot State Lansing and
Mr. Wilson. In tho forenoon Mr. Lan
sing put forth the official statement
that the President in making his

Mr. Landing said that In his morn

to the grievances against the belliger
ents and the necessity of learning
whether the United States Is to con
