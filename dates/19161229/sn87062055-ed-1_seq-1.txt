LOCAL "HELLO" FORCE GETS
CHRISTMAS PRESENTS
Manager L. C. Riley of the local
telephone service was one of he well
; pleased individuals working for a cor
' poration, Christmas. The Mountain
States Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany, in appreciation of good-service
felt that they could afford to "Santa
Clnus" a little on their own account,
consequently handed Riley a good
' substantial check for himself and one
,, each for the rest of the force in, the
local "number please" shop. The
company advises that the little bonus
, was not taken out of the profits, but
out of the pockets of the stockhold
ers. The little slip was accompanied
the checks read:
"This check is your part of a Spe
cial Bonus being distributed among
certain classes of telephone employees
throughout the United States, to aid
them in meeting the unusual condi
tions now existing throughout the
country. It is not distribution of pro
fits, nor do all employees participate.
It is to help those employees whose
,' margin between income and necessi
ties is narrow.
These conditions have had a similar
effect upon the margin between in
come and necessities of our company,
' and we ask for a continuance of your
helpful co-operation.

I SOLDIER DOES NOT
r' WANT TO BE AN ANGEL
. Douglas, Ariz.,' Dec. 22, 1916
Mr. Editor;
Will you pease tell us how to live
in tho army so we look like angels?
They" don't want us to drink, chew
nor smoke. They won't let us taste
melons, ice cream or soda pop. They
" won't let us travel with the other kind
of girls. And they don't want us to
be mashers.. And if we're reported for
breaking this rule we get six months
1 to work like a mule, and pay sixty
" dollars to Uncle Sam as a rule. They
''won't let us wear civics, because they
know that most respectable girls
won't travel with men in uniform.
' And we can't get married on fifteen a
month unless some heiress is willing
to live on love. They won't let us die
of any disease. So we can amuse
Villa with another chase. They want
us to save our money so when wo die
iour relatives won't have to cry. The
,best thing to do for Uncle Sam is to
preserve his soldiers in a glass jar.
Respectfully,

"OLD INDIAN JOE" SUDDENLY
ANSWER5JALL OF MAKER
"Old Indian Joe" is no more. He
was found dead before his fireplace in
his little home across the track Satur
day afternoon. Death had come sud
denly as he had been out and around
in the morning and had done a hard
days work the day previous. Dr. Tom
Manning was called and on examina
tion expressed the opinion that a sud
den attack of pneumonia had caused
his death, induced by the work of the
day before. He had been treated by
Dr. Manning several times for similar
attacks of pneumonia.
"Old Indian Joe's" real name was
Jose Martines, but he was more
pleased with his name of "Old Indian
Joe" and used it always except when
it was necessary to give his correct
name.,
He was a man along in the eighties,
if not older, but his early history was
something of a mystery. To some
few whom he took into confidence, he
claimed to be an Apache Indian, cap
tured when a boy by Navajos in some
of the many fights between them and
the Apaches. While still but a boy
was taken by a white family and
brought up to manhood, taught to
read and write and given a fairly
good education. He came to Flagstaff
in the early days, just how long ago
no one of the old timers seem to know,
but he soon made a home,for" himself
and a place in the hearts of the people
by his big pleasant smile for every
one, as well as for his industry. He
was an expert in tanning the hides of
wild animals but his main work had
been that of an expert house cleaner,
rather an unusual occupation for an
Indian, but many of the housewives of
Flagstaff relied upon him annually
and can testify to his splendid, pains
taking ability.
Peace be with you, "Old Indian Joe"
is the wish of many a good friend
and may the "Happy Hunting
Ground" be your reward for years of
faithful service. .
Fireman Murdered at Needles
A Santa Fe fireman named F.
Morse was held up by two young
Mexicans Christmas night and killed.
In resisting their attempt to hold him
up one of the assailants shot him, kill
ing him almost instantly.
One of the murderers was captured
the next day down the river and a
strenuous search is being made for
the other man, who so far has been
able to evade tho officers.
LAND OFFICE APPOINTMENT
DIVDDE ARIZONA SENATORS
Recommendation of two separate
and distinct democrats for the office
of register of the United States land
office at Phoenix by the two Arizona
senators became known recently. That
these recommendations have dead
locked the appointment, is the asser
tion of one well up in official political
situation in the infant state.
Senator Mark Smith, the elder
statesman, it is said, wants the sec
retary of the interior to name Scott
White for the office. Senator Henry.
F. Ashurst is pushing the name of
John L. Irvin of Phoenix.
It is understood that both senators
have attempted to strengthen their
candidates by securing letters from
attorneys practicing before the land
office in Phoenix.
SOLDIERS HOME FOR XMAS
Lieutenant John Matthews and
Sergt Frank Curtis of Co. I, came
home from Naco last week on a ten
dav's leave of absence from border
duty. This their first visit home since
they left for the border last May and
as far as they know they will remain
on the border indefinately.
Both say the Flagstaff contingent is
getting along nicely with but little
sickness among them. There was an
enidemic of pneumonia among some
of the troops from other states, but
the Arizona 'boys were not troubled
with it.
They have not had any scraps as
yet but are doing out-post duty most
of the time.
BIG HOLLIDAY SCATTER
Many members of tho Normal facul-,
ty took advantage of the holiday sea
son to visit their homes or friends.
Among them were: Miss Barber, who
is spending her vacation in Los" An
geles. Mrs. C. 0. Robinson and
daughter Marjorie are the guests $f
Mrs. C. C. Hutchinson in Phoenix.
Mrs. Beckwith is spending her vaca

Nora Blorae is in Phoenix.
A Pullman car completely filled
with happy students left last Friday
night for Phoenix, to rfpend the few
joyous days with friends and relatives

FORGED TO GRANT TOM
HIS
Though examination of tho ballots
still continue at Phoenix with varying
fortunes, in which Campbell has lost
and gained as has Governor Hunt,
Secretary Osborn, at last under press
ure concluded that Uic official returns
should receive his sanction, and Tom
Campbell was issued a certificate of
election and will take his seat as gov
ernor of the state January 2nd, 1917,
regardless of what may happen
through other contests brought by
Governor Hunt's attorneys.
The abortive attempt by high hand
ed proceedings to railroad Campbell
before he could get a hearing, signally
failed not only in the courts but
brought about a wave of popular sen
timent throughout the state against
such a proceeding boding no good to '
those most interested in tho election
of Hunt.
The contest may go on, but so far
nothing has been found to indicate
that more than clerical errors have
hecn made by the different boards, ex
cept the accidental "mislaying of a
sack of ballots in which Campbell had
received the majority of the votes.
A semi-sensation was sprung Mon
day by watchers claiming that some
of the ballot sacks in the charge of
the court had been tampered with, but
a careful inspection of the seals
seemed to prove that they had been
broken by official handling them
rather than an attempt to steel or
FALLS OFF WATER WAGON
AND HITS WATER TANK
It is true that the world is com
posed of just "one dumed thing after
another." Experience is a great
teacher but what's the use of expe
rience? Some weeks ago in the dark of the
night, a friend attempted to go home.
It was in the old personal use days.
He had personally used and possib
ly abused, but in telling of his pecu
liar facial appcarencc, did not excuse,
but told it as it appeared to him: "1
started for home alright and was
making good headway; but the feller
that was cranking the earth seem to
be sorter fitful and would make the
old thing go by fits and starts; I knew
where the earth was but every now
and then I couldn't put my foot on it,
and sometimes when I did they would
wabble it sideways and I could see
the road coming up toward my face
just like big waves on the ocean. I
took several of these ground swells
on my shoulder just to keep my face
from being a social outcast; I'll bet
my spedomiter made four miles in the
first hundred yards on the way home,
but I had no way or regulating the
measly thing."
"You never saw so many things
that they will sling in your way when
you're going home sorter teetered,
that way. When I got to the, railroad
crossing, over there where the big
water tank stands, I saw three of
them; I felt sure in my own mind that
there was only one of them, but they
move things so rapidly at times I de
cided to take no chances. I took a
good look at all af them and attempt
ed to jump through between 'em, and
I be ding blasted if I didn't hit the
main one, and it was full of water at
that. Can you beat it? Three water
tanks a hundred foot high and I
lammed into the one that had the
water in it and it didn't budge an inch.
I have passed that danged water tank
for years and it never acted that way
before."
a
Arrested on Serious Charge
William Charles, a barber who has
been in business here several years,
was arrested Wednesday and taken to
Holbrook for a preliminary hearing
on a warrant charging a felony. It
it alleged a young Mexican woman is
involved. Charles waived a perlimi
nary examination and was bound over
to the superior court in the sum of
$1500, in default of. which he was con
fined in the county jail. Winslow

tory at Flagstaff and R. G. Babbitt of

CAMPBELL
CERTIFICATE OE ELECTION
change them.
It is undoubtedly evident to the at
torneys for Hunt that the small num
ber of mistakes and changes that
could be made by errors on the part
of the election judges, is insufficient
to elect Hunt, for changes are made
both ways in about equal proportion,
with Campbell still maintaining his
lead.
The charge made by the Hunt con
tingent of attorneys was that "every
thing" was Avrong because Campbell
got the mist votes, and they felt that,
since it was normally a democratic
state, the ballots should be gone over
again to see if there was not some
possible chance of throwing enough
votes out to change the result.
,It is right and proper to contest
when there is evidence of fraud; it is
his right as on American citizen, but
there should be a reasonable conten
tion on his part, a showing of where
the wrong was committed in a specific
charge, not merely the disgruntled
statement that he had not received a
sufficient number of votes to elect
him, and for that reason the whole
thing should be done over again for
his especial benefit. '
There is no doubt in the mind.of the
average citizen that Campbell won the
election, and, if it was left to them on
that basis, Campbell would receive a
few thousand more votes the next
time than ho did this time.
DRESSWELL SHOP
CHANGES HANDS
Tommy Dent has purchased the
Dresswell Shop of C. A. Black, and
has become a full fledged merchant in
the dress-well line of clothing and
gent's furnishings. The sale of 'the
business took place last Friday when
it was turned over to the new owner
by Mr. Black. ,
The Dresswell Shop is one ofthe
best little up to date shops of the
kind in the state, where nothing but
the very latest is kept in stock for
the trade. .
This is Tommy's first ndventure in
to the business world for himself, but
he has had considerable experience in
the line of business, aside from the
fact that he has natural business abil
ity. COSTICAL FISTICAL FISTICUFFS
At a Christmas dance Monday even,
ing, a difference of opinion as to just
what was etiquette or not eti-quite,
according to "haut gout" (which
means hot soup or something like
that) an encounter occurred which
afterwards resulted in an, altercation,
which made it necessary for Night
Marshal "Wicked" Thompson to ex
punge a couple of the foot-throbbers
from participating in the festivities
of the occasion. Feeling somewhat ung
weed, the dumed French spell in "en
nui," as it sounds like we spelled it;
took the appcrance of two of them to
the court house in the cky hall where
Judge Layton sits en-mob, as it were
and they were allowed to give a syn-
opsis of their previous acts, and what
l led up to or fell away from the vox
populi whack 'em durn 'em. In this
, test two of the voxes were popped for
$100 each for slamatarious conduct,
which for its purpose might have
resulted in tne reduction oi our per
capita, as it were, speaking in high
flown language.
Besides that, tKere was snow and
cold winds Tuesday.
HOLDEN DISMISSES
SUPERVISORAL CONTEST
Notice was received Saturday by
Attorney Crable from Fred Holden,
advising him that owing to the illness
of his mother in the cast, he would
not be able to be present to take part
in the contest "brought by him against
Fred Garing for supervisor, conse
quently requested that the contest
proceedings be dropped, which action
was immediately taken by Attorney
Crable.

E RATES
ARE SO
IN FLAGSTAFF
That the cost of fire insurance is
greatly increased by many small
shacks and board buildings scattered
amongythe business buildings of the
down town district, buildings that are
not worth tearing down, yet help to
keep up the insurance rate regardless
of the fact that the people have paid
for an up to date fire truck and have
thebost fire protection of any town
of its size in the country, may have
caused the report that a subscription
list and petition was being circulated
to recompense the people who own the
board shacks and asking the city
council to have these tumbled-down
shacks and fire menaces removed from
the down town district, in order that
the fire insurance rates may be de
cently adjusted among the other pro
perty owners.
Occupying prominent places as they
do neither fire insurance inspectors
nor tourists fail to ask who they be
long to and rate the town accordingly.
A $300,000 water system and a
$5,000 chemical fire truck with a paid
fireman, does not seem to appeal to
the insurance companies; their highly
trained fire inspectors merely point to
the menacing fire traps on adjacent
property, which are not for sale at any
price, and say, "we must protect our
company from possible loss from such
buildings."
Fire insurance in eastern towns and
cities similarly situated costs about
one-third what it does in Flagstaff.
'UNCLE SID" IN OKLAHOMA
W. C. Colcord, the cattleman, was in
Flagstaff a few days this week from
Roosevelt. The many friends of
"Uncle" Sid Clay regret to learn that
he has been in bad health for several
months since going to Roosevelt with
Mr. Colcord, and is now back in Okla
homa City undergoing treatment.
For while "Uncle" Sid happened to be
a nephew of Casslus M. Clay, the
famous Kentuckian and sorter leaned
over toward democracy so far that he
looked like a Norman horse among a
bunch of Shetland ponies, there was a
way about him that seemed to "sor
gum" all political varities to him just
the same. There are a heap of old
friends here who want him back again
just to "fuss" with, and they expect
him back in the spring.

passing it at Williams, pled guilty
before Judge Perkins yesterday. His

WHY
DOES FLAGSTAFF NEED
A KICK0R A SHOVE?
Nels Darling, one of the live wires
on the lecture circuit who has made a
hit in other towns in the state with
his talks on "Community Problems,"
utterly failed to secure an audience in
Flagstaff at his evennig lecture. No
interest was aroused arpong the busi
ness men and but three or four were j
present at the Emerson school the
evening he was to talk. That he was
wel worth while is well known, but he
failed for some reason to even gain an
audience here.
Why he signally failed to attract
any Interest in Flagstaff is one of the
hard problems to answer. i
It would seem that a deep student
in psychology would be much better
adapted to this community in tho first
instance, to ascrtain the mental condi
tion and analize our peculiar condi
tion. By this we do not mean the
community was right or that they
were especially wrong because they
did did not care to hear him talk on
the subject for which he is noted. It
may have been at an inopportune
time, or it may be because 'of a sur
feit of over education all along the
same line at the same time.
There is no question but what the
people of Flagstaff are alive and
awake to the opportunities presented
them, and sometimes we are con
strained to wonder if the people are
not presented too many opportunities,
too often, to fully appreciate them.
There Is no question In our mind as to
Darling's ability to have pleased any
audience he appeared before, and that
he would have been appreciated in
Flagstaff, but the people seem to feel
that they have had more than they
can digest along with their other
business affairs.
In other words, really, hasn't Flag
staff been swamped with so many
really and truly good things that we
lack the real hearty interest that
should go with them?
FIGHT IS STILL ON AND
TOM CAMPBELL NEEDS FUNDS
Though previous efforts have been
unavaling in the unseating of Tom
Campbell as governor, after having
received his certificate of election, the
fight is going merrily on and there
is a necesity of furnishing funds to
see that the votes of the people of the
state of Arizona are recorded as they
were intended to be cast by the voter.
While the official returns show that
Tom Campbell received the most
votes, the question is now, whether he
can stand the strain of paying the ex
pense of repeating the election and
proving that the ballots for him were
intended for him.
There is 'need of funds in his case
to help count the ballots over again.
A dollar or two will help to see that
it is done fairly. Leave.it with John
Zalaha, at the Arizona Central Bank.-
