ing, poultry, live stock judging, farm
mechanics, and horticulture.

CHARLEVOIX COUNTY'S
OPPORTUNITY
Failure to act now in securing our
proportion of the funds set aside by the
United States Government for the
nurposc of building good roads will be
positively suicidal policy.
This money (seventy-five millions)
has already been appropriated and
there should be some few men in Char
levoix county who will go after it and
get it, as well as the thirty-five hund
red promised by the Stale. This, in
addition to the part given by the
government, will give our portion of
the national highway, known as the
West Michigan Pike and Dixie High
way, such a boost that we ourselves
will have but little to pay.
Now, fellow citizens of the greatest
county in the State is the greatest op
portunity of the age. Do it now. If
you find yourself going to sleep in a
business way, wake up sufficiently to
buy a small stock of dynamite (just
enough to blow you up nicely). Sit
down on it, light it and while you are
up in the air get your second wind and
Degin lire anew. mere win De no
doubt that during your flight you will
form a solemn resolve something like
this. "If I ever live to get on earth
again, I'll work for the general good of
Charlevoix county and for the building
of roads with a permanence. I will save
both myself and my heirs from an ever
Cstingly big sum to help keep up gravel
or macadam roads."

Anti-Injunction
Proposals
Effort Will Be Made to
a Legislative Act.
Have
ine Michigan federation or Laoor
has fai,ed in its attempt to amend the
constitution of the state of Michigan
v,a tRe initiative ana reierenaum roure.
The Federation proposed to amend
the fundamental law of the common-
wealth so that judges or the circuit
courl snouia no longer nave tne power
to issue injunctions in labor disputes.
ine manure or me united union laoor
forces of the state to obtain a statewide
rererendum on the antt-injunction pro
I position is of the deepest significance,
j The movement has been urged and
vigorously prosecuted for many months
and lts failure means much to the vot-
ers or tne entire state.
The constitution provides that an
initiative petition for an amendment to
II A! A., A' A V Al
the constitution must bear the signa
tures of not less than ten per cent of
the qualified voters, and that, "the
total number of votes cast for governor
at the regular election last preceding
the filing of any petition proposing an
amendment to the constitution shall be
tne Dasis uPon wnicn ine number or
legal voters necessary to sign such a
petition snail De computed,
The Michigan Federation of Labor
j sought to have the proposed amend
ment submitted to the voters at the
recent general election. Thus it would
l have been necessary for the Federation
to procure at least 44,000 signatures, as
the total vote for governor in 1914 was
140,448. Moreover, it is necessary that
such petitions shall be in the hands of
the secretary of state four months
prior to the election at which the pro
posed amendment is to be submitted.
It was therefore mandatory that the
44,000 signatures be procured by early
July. Every energy of the Federation
and its allied local federations was bent
in the direction of obtaining the 44,000
signatures within the time limit. The
campaign was a spirited one, but the
Federation was many thousand names
short when the final day came.
Still hopeful, the union forces then
started the campaign anew to have the
proposed amendment submitted in the
spring election of 1917. But here en
tered a new element In the mean
while we have had a new election for
governor and the total vote for that
office in November last was more than
: G50,000. Thus it was necessary to have
not less than 65,000 signers and the
petitions would have to be in the sec'y
of state's hands bv Dec. 7th last.
Again the campaign failed. The
federation was able to muster few more
. than 40,000 signers.
! The Michigan Manufacturers' Ass'n
gave the proposal effective publicity in
the newspapers of the State so that the
ordinary voter could appreciate the
purpose and effect of the measure.
But so far as any direct appeal to the
workman of the state is concerned, this
Association bided its time for the con
test at the polls confident in the good
judgment of the people.
Now what does the Federation of
Labor propose? It announces that it
will go before the legislature which
convenes in January and demand a
legislative act which will achieve the
same end as was proposed by the con
stitutional amendment that failed to re
ceive sufficient votes to submit it to the
people at a general election.
In other words, the allied union labor
forces of Michigan will demand a
statute taking away from circuit judges

i ji. .,;
tional a similar act by the
.gislature of
that state.
The deep significance of the failure
of the Michigan Federation of Labor to
obtain sufficient signatures for a con
stitutional referendum lies in this fact:
The Federation and its allied bodies
haye a total membership of more than
, po'rtion to the totftl number of worker.
30,000. Ihis or course is small in pro-
in Michigan, but it at least was a strong
nucleus for the petitions. It is very
evident then, that not all the members
of the various unions themselves sign
ed the petitions.
1 Of course it is mere speculation why
, the union workers of the state did not
all rally to the initiative proposal, but
it is safe to presume that many of them
had this in mind; if the circuit judges
had not the right to issue injunctions
in labor disputes, the resultant situa
tion would have harmed labor itself.
The lawless element in labor circles,
seizing control of a dispute wonld be
unrestrained in the wrecking of the
employer's property and the smashing
of his business. Anarchy and chaos
would prevail were the courts power
less to prevent it. The law abiding,
decent, industrious element in union
labor, and that element is in the major
ity, feared the result of unrestrained
violence.
This is why the petitions fell. And if
the legislature is responsive to the. will
of the people it represents, the attempt
of the Michigan Federation to force the
anti-injunction act through that body
doubtless will also fall.
BRIEF ITEMS FROM
U. S. DEP'T AGRICULTURE
Permits for the importation of 127,706
canaries were issued by the Biological
Survey during the past year.
The Bureau of Soils of the depart
ment last year mapped in detail the
various soils of 24,749,440 acres in 75
areas in 32 States.
Two thousand bluebiil and 300 white
winged scoter ducks were found to
destroy 8,000 oysters a day in a single
bay near Olympia, Wash.
For correcting soil acidity, 1 ton of
burned lime is practically equal to
tons of slaked lime or 2 tons of ground
limestone, in case all three forms are
of equal grade of purity.
Successful methods for the control of
the foot-rot of sweet potatoes, a serious
and destructive disease in several States
have been developed by the specialists
of the department.
The Bureau of Soils is cooperating
with cement mills, blast furnaces, and
wool scourers with the object of enabl
ing them to recover potash as a by
product wherever this proves to be
commercially feasible.
In 1904 the actual cash road and
bridge expenditure in the United States
averaged slightly less than $28 per mile
of rural roads. In 1915 the cash road
and bridge expenditure had increased
to an average of $109 per mile of r6ad.
Practically no injury to alfalfa from
summer heat has been recorded in dry
climates, but high temperatures com
bined with much moisture in the at
mosphere are so injurious that it is
difficult to grow the crop successfully,
under these conditions.
The pasturing of corn is especially ap
plicable to semiarid regions. The dry
soil is not injured by the animals, and
very little corn goes to waste or spoils
by coming in contact with the soil. The
stalks are left in good shape to prevent
the drifting of snow.
What a noiseless world this would be
if women were as quiet all the time as
they are when it comes to telling their
age.
The trouble with some men is that
they seem to think they are entitled to
a month's vacation every time they
work an hour.
Even with his remarkable memory
the oldest inhabitant fails to recall that
he has inflicted his reminiscences on
everybody he knows.

SEND CONDEMNED
BEANS ABROAD
Oceana Canning Co., of Shelby
Asks Department for Goods.
Washington, Dec. 26. The Oceana
Canning Company of Shelby, Mich.,
owner of a large quantity of beans con
demned in the United States district
court at Grand Rapids recently, has
appealed to tne department of agricul
ture to be allowed to ship the beans
abroad. The beans were ordered con
demned by Judge Sessions because
they were affected with anthracnose
and bean blight. The order of the
judge would prevent their shipment In
interstate commerce.
Officials of the company state that
they have large orders for canned
goods from abroad, especially from the
European nations at war. They say
that there goods were condemned not
because they were ''unfit for' food" or
deleterious to health, "but because
they were affected with a kind of dry
rot which is not poisonous nor injuri
ous. The court ruled that the extent
of degree of the decomposition in the
beans was immaterial. The company
now is seeking to recover ,the goods
confiscated by paying the costs and
putting up a bond. They contend that
food intended for export and prepared
according to the direction of the for
eign purchaser is exempt from control
of the food and drugs acts if no sub
stance is used in conflict with the laws
of the foreign country.
The Shelby concern explained to the
government officials that the foreign
buyers have already tried out some of
these same beans of the same season's
growth, are satisfied with them and
want more.

A NEW LIQUOR PROBLEM
Senator Martine of New Jersey, that
stanch defender of the liquor interest
whenever prohibition Is the topic of
discussion in the Senate, Indignantly
repudiates the suggestion that foreign
ers have a greater capacity for intoxi
cants than Americans. In the recent
discussion on the pending prohibition
legislation for the District of Columbia
it developed that a provision had been
inserted ip the bill exempting members
of foreign legations from its effect be
cause they are more accustomed to its
use at home. This aroused Martine
who vehemently declared that citizens
of this country could absorb as much of
the fiery fluid as visitors to our shores.
Other Senators joined in the discussion .
until Senator Weeks of Massachusetts
suggested serious international compli
cations might arise unless the debate
were continued in executive . session
behind closed doors.
PATRONAGE IN ILLINOIS.
The President is reported to be much
incensed at Senator Jimham Lewis,
believing that the Senator's recal
citrance over the postoffice appoint
ment in Chicago lost many votes to the
Wilson ticket in Illinois. He is now in
clined to name a postmaster of his own
choosing and let the Senator do what
he will with "senatorial courtesy" or
any other old weapon of defence. We
think the President overestimates the
effect of the Chicago postoffice row.
Doubtless there have been Congress
men defeated because of issues grow
ing out of patronage. Many people be
lieve that Benjamin Harrison lost a re
election because of the accumulated
grievances arising from the same
source. Patronage, to either party, Is
both an asset and a liability with the
