that The Ekalaka Commercia

opened up for business. Theii
first location was in the building
now occupied by Stitser's harnest
shop. At that time Totn Sillet
and John Almbaugh had a notion
store there and they alloted th<
bank about'eight square feet off
in one corner to keep their safe
and set ud a desk. As soon as
the weather permitted, in Janu
ary of the following year, thei
present building was erected. A
glance at the list of officers a
that time shows; Robt. Yokley.

Wm. Freese Store | The Peck Company j Uncle S ams Agent
"Billy" Freese came here a
king time before we got the Eka
aka habit. In fact, Billy is one
>f the real old timers. Prior to
.periling up his hardware store
here he was located at Miles City
vhere he bounced around in the
lusiness circle of that place a!
a lively clip for a number o
- ears. In Ekalaka he has bni.t
ip a good business besides hold
ing down at one time or othc ;
ibout every "charity" job on
ecord. His home is one of the
test and most comfortable here
md represents a substantial in
estment. Billy's experiences
n Montana would make interest
ing reading, but for lack of space
ve can't go "gadding" about
hem. It' its too cold, too warm,
)r not enough rain, blame Billy,
le's our weather man also.
And Also Plenty of Coal

What Is
The Difference
About the NAME of a movie

our Famous Dances, Monday
Night, January 1st 1917. And
Mrs. Owens will serve midnight
supper at 35c a plate.

Grant & Fuqua Co.
Grant and Fuqua, dealing in
livestock and deeded lands, or
ganized their firm shortly after
the influx of homesteaders to this
section. At first their specialty
was livestock, farm loans and lo
cating but as soon as the home
steaders began to receive patents
to their ranches and farms they
entered the deeded land game,
not as land speculators but as a
gents. They make a specialty
)f Box Elder and Beaver Creek
lands and have such an acquaint
ance ana knowledge of this sec
tion of the state that their busi
ness has rapidly increased, Mr,
J. W. Grant, the senior member
of the firm came here in the
spring of 1910 from Bhomfield,
Nebr. to homestead land while
his partner Mr. R. V. Fuqua had
already been located here and at
that time was engaged in the
sheep business - . This company
ranks among the leading real
estate firms of the state for hon
est dealings, financial rating and
reliability.
Nims Is A Booster
Bill Nims knows a good thing,
even if he can't see it. He came
to Ekalaka upon the solicitation
of friend! and found that it is
just about as good a place as was
ever placed on the map. Since
coming here Mr. Nims has mixed
in several lines of business, first
in the meat market, then a gar
age and now the feed barn and
lumber yard. Ile is the owner

several hundred acres of farming
land north of town. At present
