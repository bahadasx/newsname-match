68th YEAR
FROM THE PEOFLB
Another Brazil Letter
Pwcmber .", 191G.
From Pivinopolis via Polio
Borizante to Curvcllo is about ."70
miles. In making this trip one
sees about an average of this state.
I made this trip ten days ago, and
during the first 210 miles I did
not see more than "0Q acres iu
cultivation and not one acre that
had been broken with a plov.
The land is prepared for planting
by scraping off clean aud then lire
to the raked up vegetation. Dur
ing the rest of the tiip one passes
through a section where there are
a good number of stations, and
there some of the land is plowed,
a ioller used and the land planted
in rows either by hand or with
planters. This laud is rich and
has quantities of lime. Corn is
the onlv croD nlantcd. One sta-
I I
tion ships annually about 200,000
bushels, of corn. The land is
beautiful and it is a "chocolate
clay loam and has something of
the topography of the Cliftonville
hills, though larger and the val
leys not so broad. When I pass
through that section I always iraf
amine I smell the sweetness o
mellilotus, but it is purely imagi
nation, for there is none in the
state as far as I am able to find
out. Aud I also cloth these hills
and valleys with the most beauti
ful growth in the world the
queen who was fo lotcd and
praised by the great and noble
1 Joe Wing, the man whpVxtended
the kingdom of this great plant,
alfalfa, from Xew York to Kansas
and from Michigan to the black
lands in South Louisiana.
The greatest monument that the
world can erect to his memory is
for us to grow six tons alfalfa per
acre where but three used to
grow.
A trip on these narrow guage
roads is not as pleasant as travel
is on No. 4 on the M. & O. The
trains are short, usually oue first
class passenger coach, one second
class, another for express, bag
gage and mail. vrhe fuel used is
wood aud the sparks aiid coals are
. so thick thai. j we soon learns to
closedown the window near by.
Yesterday, as I was coming from
Curvello, a man who sat just be
hind me was careless enough to
have his window up and soon we
all were looking ourselves over lor
lire, but the young man behind me
read on as if he were inaccessible
to the vagaries of Hying sparks.
After we had all satisfied our
selves that we were not afire, we
beean our left oil conversations
laud were soon startled by the
I young fellow calling lor hcl lii -5
coat, hat and umbrella being a tire.
I,coaldnot help laughing at the
intensity he went into the fight to
save his clothes. I should have
not laughed, though, for when 1
my hat to burn almost off my head
no one laughed. "We all carry the
marks of mucli travel on us
holes burned in the clothing, holes
in our hats, umbrellas damaged
and often a part oi our hair gone.
The road winds in and out of the
small valleys aud climb a range of
hills at about six miles an hour,
but when the top is reached and
we start down grade I always
wish I was heavily insured with
accident insurauce, but the little
engines have the ability to follow
the rails.
Everybody smokes cigarettes
and smoke in all places. Some
times I want to rush out about a
half dozen of the most insolent
looking negroes because of their
insolent way of making smoke
' rings settle over our heads. The
conductor asks ' for tickets soon
after you get on the train, but he
doesn't take them up, but at near
ly every stop he has to see them
again to be sure.no oue goes by
where he paid to.
"When you register at a hotel
you have to give your full name,
( acre, nost office, color and occupa
tion. My middle name is so long
I get to where I wish it was "Wil
liam or Henry. I am sure no
middle aged woman ever register,
for the registers I've seen show
ages from infancy up to 25 none
more than that. Many of the wo
men look much older, but I at
tribute their woven and wrinkled
faces and their giay hair to home
worries.
Every town has numbers and
cumbers of beggars. They are
permitted to have free access to
luQ stations, and ft? hotels. I
give 100 on an average each week.
Xow, please don't think 100 in
Brazilian money means what it
appears to you to be. It is 109
reis or 2 1 2c. One hundred dol
lars American money is written
at present this way: 4001000
400 mil reis. A mil ries is 1000
lies and is a silver coin about the
size of our quarter and at present
is worlh 2."e, bat its normal val
ue is olc. I gave an old man, who
is so twited and knotted that it
is sin pricing to see how he can
travel, 1000 (one mil reis) aud
watched him to see how he spent
it, aud the old idiot crawled over
to a saloon and bought rum and
cigarettes. So when I go there
nov I give him a Deacon or a
Scott Co. Register to look over.
Gee, he gets furious. I am almost
sure at times that his eagerness to
get to me will cure him. The state
makes no provision for its un
fortunates. This rum I spoke of
is made from sugar cane juice and
is the popular drink amongst the
poor people. I've seen people
bring in cotton on pack mules for
100 miles over mountains and hills
and when they sold the 150 or 200
pounds of seed cotton, the entire
crop of oue man, invest all the
money in rum aud carry it back
along that mere trail that, winds
and meanders far out away from
where there are schools and cob
blestone streets , and many evi
dences of a life worth while. I
surely feel sorry for the ignorant
creatures, whose lives are spent
in lilth and dirt, who have had no
chance and have lived only to
augment the vices of their fathers,
whose souls are alive, but small
and warped by a thousand sins
ai.d by starvation . The men all
carry long knives and double
nanelled pistols of the old firing
cap ,kiinl. I am sure the long
usage of this firery rum, tobacco
and deplorable unsanitary mud
hut$hire responsible for thou
sands of these malformed humans,
ft is against the ei'y law of Hello
lforizante for them to beg, so I
always feels a sense of relief when
i reach this city.
The Brizilian food is hard to get
accustomed to. Everything h
satuated with grease. You tnyi't
rv:v poachH oftf Kye;vne
eats lots oi meat and chielly pork.
Kice and black beans are served
even-where and at all tims. 1
eat lots of oranges, pineapples and
bananas, for these are all extreme-
lv cheap. 1 sonic tunes buy an
apple, for they smell so good and
look so red that -1 can't put the
temntation aside. The smell of
them takes me back to one Christ
mas when I was a small boy and
father had given me but a nickel
for Christmas money. I would go
to the village every day and try
to decide whether to buy four ap
ples, two oranges, a knife or a
pocket book. b'inally I woiked
the list down to the apples and
pocket book; but just about when

of pride and satisfac tion with the

Twenty-three degrees south of
tho nturttor I've come acrcss three
men who remembered passing at
one time through Noxubee county.
T talked with one man from Aus
tralia and one from Argentine
about Xoxubee and its possibili
ties, and you shon-ld have heard
the hundreds of questions they
a-iked, and the one from Argen-
tine said he intended to write ms

Peanut Oil
The government has out a new
bulletin about peanuts as a rather
new and scarce article in this
countrv, although it3 manufac
ture will, no doubt, soon be
developed.
Peanut salad oil sounds as if it
would taste good, and this bulle
tin says it is good. The first ex
traction of oil is perfectly clear
and has a delightfully nutty
flavor.
Our country has been import
ing over a million gallons a year,
and one-half of this imported oil
came through Chicago.
The bulletin recommends the
Spanish peanut as being a high
standard nut to raise for oil, as
it contains 52 per cent oil.
Three- extractions are made
from the peanuts. The first and
finest grade is made from cold,
ground peanuts, which gives a
clear, palatable oil just as the
finest olive oil comes from the
first pressing of the olives. The
ao'id extraction is made by
grii ding the peanuts and hear
in t-hpi Tin'; nil must be re
fined before using.' Much of this
oil fcoes'into'V making of mar
g&me. 1 ne fhiru extraction goes
into soap.
Cottonseed oil is widely used
for salads, but, no doubt, is in
ferior to the peanut oil. As all
vegetable oils are wholesome and
nourishing, they should be used
liberally on fruit and vegetable
salads. , .
Brigade Makes Night Hike
The provisional brigade com
nnsed of the First Mississippi,
Second West Virginia and Third
Distiict of Columbia Infantry
regiments returned to Camp Wil

1 had decided on one of these two it had been on the target range
articles, a young chap who had
plenty of money a whole quar
ter came up and bought the
pocket book. tVell, I didrf t cue
much, for I was partial to the ap
ples anyway, but I wanted to
keep my money one more night,
so 1 waited another day to do my
shopping; but the next day the
apples had all been sold. Some
how that Christmas stays with
me, and the smell of mellow ap
ples stirs up all but sub conscious
memories of a time I love to cher
ish and hold on to.
I was the happiest person in
this city when the papers finally
were sure of Mr. Wilson's elec
tioii. 1 was real nervous for near
ly a week. One day they had Mr.'
Hughes elected and the next day
it was doubtful, and perhaps,
they would grudgingly grant Mr.
Wilson would come iu after all.
I regard it as one of the greatest
victories in American history.
When you are far away from the
old home laud the greatness of the
country, the magnitude of its ac
complishments, the immensity of
our wealth and the nation-wide
spirit of progress are so notice
able, we feci proud that people
point us out as an American

little, the steps quickens and the

the love fcr the land of the Stars

Mile II ill on the Fredericksburg
Road for several hours. At mind
night, the men resumed their

morning cold hiked into camp in
splendid order shortly belore b
o'clock.
Colonel Lyman Kennon, com
manding the brigade, declared
f-hnf it was thfi first time in his
experience that he has ever had
to place a provost guard in iront
of a marching column to prevent
"straggling."
"It's a fact," said Colonel
Kennon, "i had to put a guard
in front of those fellows or they
would have gone on, regardless.
I never saw men step out so live
ly before. They just went to it
as though their lives depended
nrvM-i it- nnd hpv sure did march.
It was cold, I'll admit that, bit-.
ter cold, but then after tney naa
been walking for a m time seemed
to warm up and enjoy it.
"They wanted to continue
their march before 10 o'clock,
but I did not give the orders un
til after midnight. The men
had an opportunity to rest and
slecn for a time. When they
were awakened hot collee wa3
served them.
"An automobue and a norse
was provided for me and I could
have had my choice, but I toll
you I walked six miles of the dis
