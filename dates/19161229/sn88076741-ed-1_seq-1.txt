THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
If present conditions continue there
will be but little to relate ou the war
situation in Europe in a short time.
Small skirmishes are ruportod^iloiuj the
lines. Everything *eetT)s |'iot to an
early settlement of bost.iliti"s 'ilihouub
there is ^nothing developed to warrant
the assertion, save that uegoi iations ace
-going on. Nutral couatrit uru doing
all they ean to encourage an agreement.
Many of ihe leading dailies of this
country contend that the last severe
conflict ia fought and-it is merely trying
to see the b3st bargain than can be
made by botb factions tEat makes them
hold on.
In the east the combined armies of
the German and AuBtriatm are advanc
ing but t^e places they are t.tMiig ai6 of
but little consiquenee save lliaL tbey are
going ahead. In the west the Allies are
the aggressors but they too are making
butjiltlo progress.
Some war correspondents claim that
the lull istin account of the winter sea
son, and whea spring opens up the tinal
battles will be taught and th«t the mid
dle of summer will set* the elo^e of the
war and the Central power weakened.
THE PEACE MESSAGE.
The Peace note of President Wilson
seems to have met with about as
much favor by the warring nations of
Europe as did the Ford expedition which
went on tha«ame mission a year and a
half ago. We base our opinion on ex
tracts from the beligrant jSress.. Sever
al of the German papers thinks the
president took advantage of the proposi
tion from Berlin to terminate the war,
while the English and French view if
frpm nearly the same standpoint.
Then again Secretary of State Lan
sing took it upon himself to call in a
number of newspaper reporters just
about the time the president's message
was sent abroad and added some re
marks that did not help matters any.
The secretary came near to completely
nullifying the pacific effect of the note
by his astonishing declaration that "we
are drawing nearer the verge of war our
selves, anil therefore are entitled to
know exactly what each belligerent
seeks, in order that we may regulate our
aonduct in future."
As if this were not enough, the secre
tary added:-' "The sending of this note
will indicate the possibility of our being
forced into the war"
l.i
The president saw at once the effect
thib interview would have on his message
but it was too late for the desired effect
however Mr. Lansing sent a note of ex-|
planation but it came tt\p eleventh hour.
It looks to us at this distance tbat it
was unfortunate that President Wilson*
stopped in at this time. The change in
the political1machinery.of both England
Md France, and the successes of the
Germans in the east of late have had a ten*
deney for all of them to feel that they
are ablei to take eare of their own affairs
and President Wilson's act is looked up
with suspicion from the Cefttral pow
ers as wall as thi Entente, each imagin
ing that the president is trying to favor
the ether fellow, which we think is not

NOT **BBRLIN.**
Berlin, Ontario is a city of consider*
able importance. Its population ais
largely descendants of the Teutonic race
which were probably responsible for its
name in the first plaoe. \^hen the war
broke out the name of the place was
changed to "Kitchner," which had the
samo effect on the German population as
had Berlin to the English. Since then
a great portion of the mails have been
coming addressed to "Berlin" and noth
ing was said about it._ But now the
government has ©rfeteii that all mails
addressed -to ''Berlin, Ontario" be re
turned to the senders as there is no such
post office in the province.
In Pembina county there are many
who came from Berlin and who still
keep up correspondence with relatives
there. If they expect to have theif
mails reach them tjiey better address
them at "Kityhner."
ORDERED HOME.
Sixteen thousand of the national mil
itia who have been on the Mexican bor
der for nine months doing nothing, are
ordered back to their homes. This in
cludes the North Dakota boys. No .one
is more pleasea over the order than ibe
boys themselves. For nine months they
have been sweltering in the southern
sun, doing nothing but killing time.. It
has cost the government up in the mil
lions. The youth which comprises the
rank and file of t|ie National Guard were
ready to respond to the call of the' presi
dent. When they got there there was
nothing for them to do. These same
young men, should have been at school,
or tilling positions of responsibilities
they left when they were called. It was
a stupendous blunder on the part of the
administration to order them south, and
no one kuowS^it better than the boys
be
hi
selves.
SUSPENDED PUBLICATION*
It is rumored that.the Bathgate Pink
Paper has suspended publication for
want of patronage^ which w^ regret to
hear. Editor WiTlson was a fearless
aggressive writer, ^who wrote according
to his own convictions and the Pink Pa
per was always a welcome visitor to our
esfchange table. It is an oid adage that
a town can be measured by its local pa
per and it is generally Ihe case. The
town of Bathgate has some of the most
enterprising people we have in the
county bjit they have made a mistake in
letting the Pink Paper subside for lack
of patronage. As for Editor Willson we
regret to see him lay down his pen which
has given us many a hard knock politi
cally but which we have enjoyed for he
always conducted an honorable discus
sicm even if he was on the wrong side of
politics.
CAN BRYAN LEAD HIS PARTY?
Mr. Bryan adds his voice to those
which are advocating the abolishment of
the Electoral College. He speaks of the
"clumsiness" of the present system and
declares that "some plan should be de
vised by which the voters can vote di
rectly for the president." Perhaps Mr.
Bryan can devise that plan. It will, pt
course, be reached through an amend
ment to the constitution and by appro
priate legislatipn in congress afterward
It should involve a federal definition of
the qualification of voters and it should
carry a federal guarantee of the right of
all voters, duly qualified,1 to votei freely
and to have their votes counted as cast.
In such a modification of the electoral
system Mr. Bryan will have the co opera
tion of his political opponents. But can
he carry his own party that far?
SWAT THE WEEDS.
Weeds cause enormous losses in North
Dakota farming, yet the only way most
of them .can live from year to year is
that they be given a chance to ripen
seed. If the weed can be swatted any
time from ,the time it germinates until
it is in blossom, it is the end of that
weed, except in the case of quark grass,
sow thistle and Canada thistle. The
way wild oats increase is by ripening
before &he grain in which they grow,
and so letting some of the seed fall to
seed the land for next year. Mustard
works a good deal the same galne.
When some crop as corn or alfalfa or
a grass crop, is grown in rotation with
the grain crop the wild oats are doomed'
Why not break up the game of the
weeds by once in a while bringing in a
condition that prevents them from go
ing to seed..

JNAMES NOT IMPORTANT.
BACK TO THE LAND MOVEMENT
1
Th? annual report of the secretary of
the interior ehows that 19,000.000 acres
of public lands'were entered duriug the
fiscal year. This was more than 2,000,
000 acres in excess of the entries allowed
in any previous year. The preliminary
report given to the press does not show
how much of this acreage was allowed
under the homestead laws which require
Tesidenceasa pre-requisite to securing
the title. It is, therefore*.impossible to
determine from the facts available to
what extent this increase in public land
entries represents a "back to-tlie-land
movement."
VARIETY IN FOOD
FOR LAYING HENS.
Wheat, oats and corn are good grains
to feed the laying hen. Mr. Peterson
poultryman at the North Dakota Ex
periraent Station, recommends a dry
mash made up as follows: 3 parts bran.
2 of middlings, 2 of corn meal, 2 of beef
scraps and one part alfalfa by measure'.
Mix it well and put in a self-feeder or
hopper. This can be kept before the
birds all the time. Charcoal should also
be kept before-the chickens at all times
When Moorhead, Minn., went dry
last year because of local option, it was
predicted by advocates of the license
system, that business would be poor and
taxes increase enormously. Merchants
of the city say business has never beea
better thanrsince prohibition went into
effect, and now the city council has just
made its tax levy for tbie ensuing year,
48.5 mills on the dollar of assessed valua
tion, a tax much lower than under li
cence: Incidentally (40,000 of munici
pal bonds were recently retired which
leaves the city without any bonded debt.
Prohibition does not seem to have been
a serious interest of Moorhead, and we
are certain its morals are immeasurably
better than under license,—St. Thomas
Times.
There is a bill before congress that is
intended to put a stop to people com
ing here to remain temporarily and
then return to their native land to en
joy their earnings? This is directed- at
the laboring class from southern Europe
firho never intend to become a citizen in
the first place. It will also effect the
alians who have gone back to fight for
their country. If the bill passes, these
same people will find it difficult to re
turn. The bulk of the common railroad
men who follow construction work ara
included in this class also.
Senator McCumber has made the
statement that the president, either di
rectly or indirectly, m«de it known be
forehand to some ,of his speculative
friends that he was going to send'his
peace message and they took advantage
of it and some of them made millions in
their investments. We don't think our
senator would venture such assertion un
leas he knew what he was talking about.
Can it be that President Wilson's
peacT~proposition was intended to re
dace the high cbst of living? If that
was the intention he succeeded to a cer
tain extent for wheat went down eight
cents a bushel immediately after the
proposition was sent to the warringpow
|rs and prices have been unsteady ever
since.
