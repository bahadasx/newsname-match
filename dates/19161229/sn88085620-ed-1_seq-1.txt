STATE QUITS ON MURDER CHARGES
AGAINST THE MESABA DEFENDANTS
COMPLETE COLLAPSE OF CONSPIRACY CHARGE AND
DOCTRINE—SCARLETT, SCHMIDT AND
TRESCA FREE!
(Special Correspondence)
In open court before Judge Cant at
Duluth on Friday, Dec. 16th, a settle
ment proposed by the state and pre
viously ralified by all the defendant
prisoners nnd acknowledged by I hem
as the best that could probably be ob
tained even after long and expensive
trials, the state made a complete sur
render on murder charges against all
eight defendants, releasing Tresca,
Scarlett, Schmidt, Mrs. Malitza Mason-
OVlch and John Orlandlch, substitut
ing a charge of manslaughter against.
Masonovich, Cernogorovich and Nick
it b. to which these three pleaded
guilty.
Readers will understand that the
defendants themselves, knowing all
conditions and familiar with the sit
uation as regards the possibility of a
less fortunate outcome in case of
trial, were the ones best fitted to de
cide whether any proposal of settle
'menl. affecting them should be con
sidered. This w;ts done and the pris
oners were the adjudicators of their
own cases insofar ns the acceptance
or rejection of any plan of settlement
was involved.
On Friday, the Bth, the state's at
torney in a talk over various matters
intimated to the defense counsel that
perhaps a possible disposition could
be arranged as might be mutually
agreeable and satisfactory. Counsel
for both sides agreed that the out
come of the trials was uncertain and
considering the heavy expense at
tendant, a settlement might be ad
vantageous. Defense counsel, how
ever, stated that no settlement re
stricting activities of the union or in
fringing upon the principles contend
ed for could be {nought of. Also that
no action would be possible unless
firstly the matter be approved by tho
defense committee at Virginia, and.
secondly, the consent of the trial
judge be obtained. The next day Mr.
Qreene, state's attorney, hurried to
Virginia to consult with the trial
judge. Having obtained sanction from
the judge. Greene communicated on
Monday with the defense counsel and
they in turn summoned the defense
committee to Duluth for conference.
After considering it the committee
agreed that it was important enough
to warrant the plan being turned over
to all I be defendants in jail for their
consideration. It being impossible to
obtain satisfactory interviews in the
small rills at the jail, it was arranged
for all prisoners to be brought to the
f courthouse and interviewed in the
open jury room. No one present ex
cept the prisoners, their attorneys and
Hie defense committee. The matter
was fully discussed with Tresca, Scar
lett and Schmidt and it was repre
sented to them as merely submitted
to them by counsel and committee as
a matter of duty and without any
recommendation one way or the
other: that if they desired, counsel
would report negotiations off and
proceed to trial. After careful Inquiry
the three organizers stated that the
courtesy and importance of the mat
ter suggested a submission of the en
tire plan to the other defendants,
Masonovich, Cernogorovich, Nick'ich
and Orlandich, for their sole decision
as to what action should finally be
I aken.
Sneaking lo these four through
Ntcklch, GUday said: "Now, boys,
Ibis is a matter in which you have the
entire say. nothing has been decided
upon, nothing will be without your
thorough consent and approval; If you
approve we will treat with the other
side, and if not -we shall go to trial."
After the details had been given them,
they with one accord shouted their ap
proval, Philip Masonovich saying: "I
►Vie glad to take three times one year if
these oilier men" pointing to Tresca,
Schmidt and Scarlett—"could be free,
because they can do more good than
we can. The union provides for my
family, so what do I care? I can serve
my short seletiee standing on my
head!"
' * Orlandich, when told he would be
offered to take Phillip's term and
learning it could nol be done, insisted
"he be imprisoned with the others. The
rest prisuadd him al las I to go out and
look after the Masonovich family until
> Phillip be released; then while all
present, already deeply moved by the
spirit of solidarity shown- strove
• vainly to concetti their emotions;
Cernogorovich and Nickich each
begged that they be allowed lo as

go free! The impossibility of this
reaching their understanding, they
gave cordial assent to the plans, and
in keeping with some simple, touching
native custom, all clasped hands and
kissed each oilier to signify mutual
devotion and ratification of the
agreement.
A settlement assured, next morning
in open court, Masonovich, Nickicb
and Cernogorovich were formally j
sentenced to an indeterminate term,
c ligible to parole in one year. Mr 3.

Schmidt released upon an indefinite!
postponement without bond or recog
nizance for their return and the ex
pressed understanding that they go
from the range only when their con
venience permitted, and they were so
disposed, nor was any exaction made
limiting their activities on or off the
range. They went from the room
practically free, and observers look
for an early dismissal of their cases.
Arthur Le Sueur, assistant counsel,
arriving in the city and comnig to
court as the hearing began, was in
formed of the settlement and signified
his approval,
The district attorney, In stating to
the court, said he had entered a nolle
prosequi as to two of the principals
and the three organizers because he
had no evidence that would warrant
a conviction. This declaration of the
state and iis acceptance by the court
Is of particular and immense im
portance, as the vital PRINCIPLE
INVOLVED in the entire case was the
endorsement or repudiation by the
courts of the stale of the DOCTRINE
OF CONSPIRACY as cited In the
i iuymarkci decision, which, though
apparently obsolete and infamous, has
been often used against labor leaders
—John Lawson of Colorado among
others.
This outrageous precedent is now
BROKEN in force; even more than a
verdict of "not guilty" given to the
organisers by a jury could break it;
a jury's verdict being on a point of
fact, while this case can be cited as
the court's opinion on a question of
b gal definition.
A great danger is removed from
ALL organized labor and evidence es
tablishing some physical complicity
in the deed will have to be introduced
before a speaker or organizer can be
held for crimes committed by other
persons.

mittee of the miners' union on Sunday

The Labor Journal
SUNDAY'S MASS MEETING
The meeting at Liberty ball last
Sunday was not all thai could be
Wished for a number of reasons.
The hall was cold and the audience
shivered. The meeting was not suf
ficiently nor properly advertised. The
expected delegation from Seattle
failed to come. People were too busy
with their Christmas preparations.
However, there was a pretty fail
crowd, which was held to the close
notwithstanding the untoward con
ditions.
Robert H, Mills called the meeting
to order and introduced Jake Michel
as the first speaker. Mr. Michel en
tered a vigorous protest against exist
ing conditions In Everett and con,
detuned the causes leading to and
lllioso responsible for the tragedy of
November 5.
Charles Ashley of Seattle addressed
the meeting, pointing out the lessons
taught by the attempts to throttle
free speech. He spoke bitterly of the
efforts of the daily press to prejudice
the public mind against the 74 1. W.
W. prisoners awaiting trial on a
charge of murder. He said the I. W.

arraignment of the fratricidal war in
Europe. He predicted tho coming of
a time when co-operation of workers
in all industries would be the rule—a
time when the master class would
have to go to work.
George \V. Louttlt spoke next, say
ing that the members ot the Manu
facturers' Association did not scab on
one another as do the workers, but
stood firm. He said the recent
troubles could have been averted if
we had officers who had any sense.
He charged that the men who pre
vented the I. W. \V. from landing on
the dock were violators of law. He
said the ordinance which prescribed
public speaking on crowded street In
tersections was right in the interest
of safety.
James Duncan, secretary of the
Seattle Central Labor Council, spoke
briefly and promised material aid to
Everett unions from Seattle's twenty
thousand organized workers.
Kx-Commissioner Salter sounded a
I warning note concerning the conduct
of the schools. Children are taught

Mr. Spencer thanked labor through

he was opposed to compulsory mili

several reasons, among which were
that the students in high schools were

taxpayers which they could not afford

such training carried the employment
of a competent instructor, whose sal

the school fund was not now adequate
for the growing needs of the schools.

amendments to the Industrial In

cripple it or take away from its

INDUSTRIAL TYRANNY PRACTICED
BY GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA
When the American Federation of
Labor in its late Baltimore conven
tion unanimously denounced the Gov
ernor of South Carolina for sending
five companies of coast artillery
militia to break the strike of TOO men.
women and children employed in the
Anderson, S. C, mills of the Welling
lon-Sears Corporation of Boston, the
convention called the attention of the
nation to one of the worst cases of
industrial tyranny and attempted
peonage thai still prevails in the coun
try or presumably free men and
women.
Down in Anderson, S. C, these 700
men, women and children are on the
perilous fringe 0 f starvation, or are
leaving their homes in exile because
they dare to exercise their lawful
right of union organization and in the
mime of that union, the United Textile
Workers of America, to demand a
slight increase in their meager wages.
Up in Boston, Mass., live the north
ern owners of those two southern
mills. Tlu se northern owners are the
members and officers of the powerful,
wealthy Wellington-Sears Corporation.
Rich, powerful and irresponsible. Wil
liam H. Wellington, president of the
company; S. E. Wellington, secretary;
Joseph N. Jackson, treasurer, and
other owners of the company, hide
tin Ir real responsibility for the bru
tality of repression practiced against
their southern workers. They hide
their responsibility behind cruel, ar
bitrary acts of their local superin
tendent, Robert E. Ligon, who says to
these men, women and children:
"Yes, we can afford the small 10 per
cent increase you have asked, we can
give that and more, easily; but not a
damn cent will be given while you
people belong to a union." When ar
bitration was offered by the state
board, the workers accepted the offer,
but the corporation refused it abso
lutely.
Careless, prosperous, powerful,
these Wellington-Sears owners as
sume not only to own the mills, but
to own the workers. They own the
earth about their plants, and t< 11 these
workers to get. out. They brought
eviction suits under a probably law
less law which permitted only ten
days' notice to the tenants. Tiny
brought these suits before a magis
trate who at one time had been presi
dent of one of the companies. When
the judgments were given by this
magistrate. Sheriff Ashley, friend and
neighbor Of the peaceful strikers, re
fused to put the men, women and
children into the street. When or
dered by the governor to do so. this
right-feeling officer sent back word
that he would not evict families until
those families were assured before
hand of a roof over their heads: and
he told Governor Manning that if the
governor did not like this statement.
Manning could go and put the families
out himself.
It was right there that this power
ful, irresponsible corporation of Bos
ton proved what it could do through
the Governor of South Carolina. That
governor immediately ordered five
companies of coast artillery militia to
go to Anderson. S. C. —to go to the lit
tle mill villages of Cluck and Equinox I
and put the strikers out of their
homes. And the people of the whole
State of South Carolina must pay
$4000 per week while those artillery
militia men overawe the men, women
and children of their own suite at the
behest of the distant arbitrary cor
poration.
in the school houses of Qluck, where
little children of the workers used to
get the meager a luoa: ion allowed to
them, now a company of South Caro
lina soldiers are quartered. They are
there because the children have been
put out. With almost Incredible mean

them through the little children, who
could not yet be used to make Wealth

This almost incredible act of mean

have run only lamely and crippled.
