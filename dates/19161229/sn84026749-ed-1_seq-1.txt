The American Government found
Itself today In a diplomatic quandary
pver Mexican matters.
It had to decide whether to stay by
Its guris and tell Carranza that the
American-Mexican peace commission
Is ended, In view of his failure to
sign the troop withdrawal protocol,
or whether to relax from a recently
firm position and yield to Ills further
Importunate appeal for modification of
the agreement.
The last word, before he answered
demands for signing, was substanti
ally this:
"We have put In three months fram
ing this protocol. It represents our
best efforts. Wo rtinnot alter It. You
must answer by December 20."
Falls To Meet Demands.
In substance, Carranza has failed
wholly to live up to these demands.
Ills answer Is so framed that Its
words arc Intended to mollify the
American Government, and It appeals
for a little more change.
The American commissioners are
scheduled to meet soon to consider It.
Then there will be a Joint session at
which their answer will be presented,
and If the temper of the American
sldo has not cooled the answer, some
here believe, will be, "We are done
with peace negotiations."
nut officials handllnr the Mexican
matter kept their own counsel Just as
closely aa those officials In charge of
the European peace situation. Wheth
er they would decide to strain a point
and modify the protocol and continue
deliberations, was an unanswered
question. '
Arretlondo Still Lingers.
Meantime, Mexican Ambassador
Designate Arredondo lingered In town,
apparently Influenced In not taking
his scheduled departuro because ho
did not want It to appear that his
leave-taking was linked with Car
ranza'a failure to comply to the Amor
lean demands.
The linking of the two would tend
to give affairs a belligerent tone;
whereas Carranza Is thought In many
quarters to be desirous really of hav
ing the American expedition stay In
Mexico while Villa is active, though
to "save his face" he publicly protests
this occupation.
VILLA MOVES ON SALTILLO
Evacuates Torreon After Levying
Hundred Thousand Pesos.
EI. PASO, Dec. 20. After levying a
"war loan" of 100,000 pesos on the
city, Villa has evacuated Torreon, and
is now on the march toward SaltlUo,
according to reports given out by
Carranza military officials at Juarez.
The Coahutla metropolis has been
reoccupled by government tuoona un
der General Murgula, It waa an
nounced. While In Torreon, Villa was care
ful not to harm any foreigners or
their property,
Mexican government officials to
day admitted that the garrison at
SaltlUo had evacuated the town last
week, leaving It unprotected, while
the garrison at Monterey Is weak and
unless te-enforced will make no stand
against the Vllllstas.
"Science and religion do not con
flict." "Learned men whose work Is cre
ative are generally believers In Ood
and In Immortality."
"Washington scientists show a dis
tinct leaning toward tho acceptance
of religious principles as sound and
convincing."
"Writers, physicians, chemists, and
phllsophers, such as Sir Ollvar Lodge,
Paul Dourget, II. G. Wells, Oeorge
Uernard Shaw, William Dean llowelts,
and men of like stamp, are of distinct
ly religious minds."
Cited Government Scientists.
This forms the gist of the rsplles
of thn clergymen of Washington to
tho statements of Prof, James II.
Leuba, professor of psychology at
Ilryn Mawr, who has Just published a
book stating that S3.2 per cent of tho
men listed In "American Men of Sci
ence" are'non-bellevers. Prof. Leuba'a
book has called forth comment In this
city, because he spoke particularly of
the men of science In the employ of
tho Government, most of whom are
located In Washington. He said these
made up 12 per cent of the scientists
to whom he referred In tils book.
"My experience has been Just the
opposite of Prof. Leuba," said the

At the offices of the Interstate Com

that a number of representatives of
the railroads would be present next
Tuesday, and also the heads of the

bitterly opposed to the President's
recommendation.
Senator Newlands, chairman of the
committee, Intends to hurry the hear
Ings to a conclusion wRh as little delay
as possible because he believe Congress
should ensct the legislation. Ho said
not long ago tho matter was so Im
portant that an extra session should bo
called If necessary.
To Vrge Compromise,
It In understood the brotherhoods
will urge a compromise plan which

tures. One of the plans which the
brotherhoods and railroads have ne
gotiated over Is for a special Govern
ment waga fixing commission on
which tha roads, the employes and thej
