3emidji Team Puts Up Clever Game
But It Being First Contest
Short on Form.
Although outweighed and battling
against big odds, the "Big Bemidg"
basketball team in its first game of
the season last night at the Armory
held the strong Carleton College All
Star team to a 36 to 28 score. The
visitors had a big advantage over the
local boys in that four of the five
players were members of Carleton's
championship football eleven and
were in perfect condition after the
close of the gridiron steason. During
the first half Bemidji was wholly on
the defensive while the All-Stars shot
fourteen baskets for a total of twen
ty-eight points while Bemidji scored
three points, two on a field basket and
one on a foul.
In the second half the Bemidji
players suddenly came to life and
held the visitors on the defensive
during the entire period, scoring 25
points and holding their opponents
to four field baskets. During the
first half the Bemidji five seemed to
be confused in its signals and were
at a loss where to pass the ball, but
tSb( in the second period the team was
.'.working smoother and with a few
j^ore games ought to be working like
'j4 machine
The same teams will play again
this evening and predictions are be
ing made that "Big Bemidg" will
win tonight.
The teams lined up as follows:

rope as one of the most active sing
ers of opera roles of his time. He was

A question was asked and unanswered at the meeting of the
city council Wednesday evening. The question was asked by Al-
derman Lahr of the First ward and was addressed to City Attorney
Russell. It came up during the discusfsion of financial matters
and Alderman Lahr asked the city attorney if the city was allowed
to pay bills when there was no money in the funds with which
to meet the payment. Alderman Lahr also stated that paying
bills when there was no money in the funds on which the warrants
were drawn was illegal and that the city officials were liable for
the money so authorized.
The question was* not answered.
In Chapter VI, section 4 of the City Charter of Bemidji, under
the head of "Warrants," appears the following:
"Each warrant shall be payable to the order of the
person in whose favor it is drawn. No warrant on any
specific fund shall be drawn or issued until there is suffi
cient money in the treasury to the credit of such fund to
pay the same, together with all other warrants issued since
the adoption of this charter that may then be outstand
ing against such fund, and the council is hereby prohibited
from authorizing the issue or ordering paid of any such
warrant until there is sufficient money, as aforesaid, in
the treasury applicable thereto to meet such warrant, to
gether with all other warrants which may be outstanding
against such fund.
"No officer or official body of the city shall have any
power to contract or create any indebtedness against the
city except in accordance with the provisions of this char
ter, and any warrant issued contrary thereto shall be
wholly void as to the city, but the same shall constitute
a personal claim against the officer or officers issuing the
same, and any member of the council voting to authorize
the issuance of the same or attempting to create such in
debtedness."

Soldier Slayer O Wife
Begins Prison Sentence
(By United Pfess)
London, Dec. 29.(By mail)
Richard Cunningham, 34, the lance
corporal who killed his wife in a fit
of grief over her betrayal while he
was in the trenches, today began a
sentence of one year under a man
slaughter charge. The stern English
jury frankly tempered justice with
mercy in Cunningham's case in
which the unwritten law played a
deciding part.
Cunningham, taking his turn in
the trenches, was tormented by his
wife's silence. He seldom heard from
her during his first few months with
the colors and later her letters ceasted
altogether. Friends wrote him men
tioning a mysterious caller at his
home in London. The soldier wrote
to local authorities in an effort to
learn what had become of his little
son but received scant satisfaction
in the official replies with their im
personal wording and red tape.
At the first opportunity Cunning
ham obtained leave from France and
returned home. A few days* later the
police found him lying unconscious
across the dead form of his wife. She
had been strangled.
An officer sa-d Cunningham Avas a
-high type of soldier without a single
black mark against his name in the
army records. His former employer
gave him a similar good character.
In passing the minimum sentence
the jury recommended .hat the con
victed Soldier ought not to be com
pelled *to serve his sentence among
common criminals.
