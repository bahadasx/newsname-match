"Tardlnes.."
At the reouest of ninnv of our
reader we publish the following In
teresting article on "Tnnllnes," by
Miss ticrtntdc Todd, tepcher or the
eighth grade of our public school,
read before a meeting of the Parent-
Teher' Association, Decendier b,
lDio:
Our cnncentlon of school tin
changed with the t'mesj the Knrlrnn
ha broxdened grently. Each new
year trake new nd ifvnter demar
on the parent, the child, and tho
teacher. Going to school is now being
looked upon more nx a business: a
business' at which cacti must make
rrood. In order to make irood. the im
portance of punctuality and regu'ar-
ty can not tie over-estimated. This
new conception, that of going to
school Is a profession, ha almost
eliminated tardiness from the city
schools, but we still have some In the
town, more in tho village, and a great
deal still exists In the rural Krhools.
"There are two principal causes for
Irregularity In school. First, tardi
ness that is caused by the parent,
hi or her negligence, selfishness or
ignorance. Many rather and mothers
lo not realize the Importance of
punctuality and regularity in school
In the future welfare of their chil
dren, and keen them at home, or do
not start them to school on time, only
on slight pretext, and sometimes for
no reason whatocvcr. Second, the
tardme that I caused by the In-
lolenro or IndilTcrenco of tho child.
"The first I the hardest to deal
with anil I tho cause of the latter.
A child naturally endowed with In
stinct which make for punctuality.
They Instructively emulate, want to
excel, Imitate and are proud and the
Mke. These rurnlsn the tiasia ror ac
tions which In turn becomes habits.
The vnluc of piincti'n'ity n n habit
cannot be over-estimated. The habit
of punctuality, like tho formation or
nny other habit, Is first n little thread,
then n string, then a cord, and event
ually a cablo so strong that for the
ruture wc need not rear, runriuniny
has then been reduced to tho basis
of habit, and has bcramo second na
ture. The child doe not then stop to
think of w-at he want to do, ho sim
ply doc it without thought. There
will lie no dancer of indifference
about getting to school on time with
such a child, for lie will know no oth
rr way than licing there on time.
"ve might can regularity ami
punctuality tho two elementary vir
tue of the moral code. If tho child
has not formed the habit of punctu
ality, tho mother should noi no an,
for it Is robbing the child of power.
You can no mora bu id character than
vou can build a tree. It I what the
child does for himself thnt give him
strength. Throw some or tho respon
sibility upon the child and hold him
responsible for the result accom
plished. Neither must the teacher be
come dogmatic. A forceful teacher
may frighten the children into con
formity with his or her will, and thus
eliminate most of the tardiness. Hut,
what I the result? Well, most of
the children will get to school on
time and that will be of economic
value; there will be some moral worth
in the promptness, even when Inspir
ed by fear, but there ia no great
moral value in it The moral strength
of the child, if altered at all, I weak
ened. On the other hand, if the child
Is taken into the teacher" confidence,
i brought to see the need of getting
to school on time, and he in turn vol
untarily gets to school on time, there
haa been a step forward made in the
development of an independent moral
character, suppose me cnua must
help his moUer wash and wipe the
dishes. If he doe the work quickly,
and as soon aa ha can, starts and
run all the way to school, he i learn
ingnot to respond to authority that
may not alway be present hut to
take the moral Initiative and do what
la best for him ana xor ine wnoit
