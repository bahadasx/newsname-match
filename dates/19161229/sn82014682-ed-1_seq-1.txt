OF PIER'S BULGE
Discharged Engineer Says That
He Sought to Save Face of
Harbor Commissioners
It H3 in the belief that his admis
sion Jacerninrf the 'bulging out of
Tier. 9 ou'd ave the harbor board
from disgrace, tnat J. G. Morgan, for
mer assistant eniner, decided to con-
.'.. fpss that he hai falsified in the mat-
:. ter. ' , .' ;; .; ;
Morsun told the story to the Star
Bulletin today, rather f lowly and rath
er hesitatingly as he looked back ovr
the weeks that have elapsed klnce he
first learned that the wall was bowed
out and resolved to keep the 'matter
eecret it-ven froj.i the loard itself.
He declares i.bat Charles II. Forbes,
chairman, and members of the board
k'new nothing; about the bow in the
wall, bat that Forbes and McCarthy
knew that It nid 'cracked at the cor
ner. It was at this time that the
dredging vas otdered stopped.
Feared Design Attacked
. "I see now that ! wag In the wrong,"
said Morgan today, but I felt that
the wharf was safe after ks first
bulge. I' thought the design of the
wharf would b3 attacked if the fact
that the wall was out was announced,
"when as a matter of fact the wall was
never designed to allow the sort of
hydraniic fill that the Lord-Young
people force'd into It
The vail went out in about three
days to the extent ioi five inches, but
I am confident that it stopped as
soon as the filling 'ceased. If the fill
had kept on It vtuld undoubtedly have
gone still more." ; r -Declares
Contractors Knew
Morgan decJvurs tht be . and , the
contractors wer j fellow conspirators in
the game. They knew the wall was
out as well as he, though Ed Lord had
prevlous'y laughed when warned that
tie bVilraulic illl would raise trouble,
he says. Morgan tells of how be him
self Juggled the figures so that the
- carpenters might tet up the top section
of wall in line.
"I wo ild find out how much the cop
per pins was off," he says, "and then
. give figures to the carpenter so the
; forms would -r In line. I did not
feel that this vras any great crime so
long as the wa'l was safe, .anyhow...
Sees Revelation Coming
'it was net. nntil after tlie meeting
on Saturday when the decision was
made .a have as investigation by two
engineers that I decided to tell all,"
Rays the former official. "I saw that
the investigation would show that the
wall box.'ed,id that the disgrace
would '.ben fall. the board. I decid
ed to put the blame on myself."
Charges Playing Politics
Morgan makes another remarkable
Btatemcat to iho effect that the mo
tion of Commissioner McCarthy to, dis
charge Mm dishonorably instead of
accepttaj the tedered lesignatlon'was
a political move that the colonel was
playing politics.
"Maybe I am biased in this regard,"
Morgan admit, "but the first thing
McCarthy said on the night of the ex
ecutive ession was not for the safety
of the wall but the likelihood oflts
preventing appropriations for future
Gregsr Is Exonerated
' William Grer, ... inspector, knew

He hoped, to vrotect Forbes, also, by
confessing. Not that ForbeB knew of
the bow, he says, but that he would

The opinion of Judge Ash ford, after he

first degree murder to first, degree
manslaughter. Bond was fixed in the
sum of f 1000. City Attorney A. M

J.S, M'CANDLESS
Takes Issue With Assurances
Yesterday; Tells of Knights
Templar Troubles
An emphatic statement that the ho
tel accommodations of Honolulu are
not sufficient for the tourists coming
here this winter is made by James S.
McCandless. Hfs statement to the
Star-Bulletin this morning comes as a
result of .a meeting yesterday after
noon of the Hawaii Promotion Com
mittee and local hotel managers. At
this meeting the hotel men said that
while it is impracticable to make res
ervations for accoMmodatlons from
January 15 to the end of the Carnival
season, tourists arriving here will be
able to find accommodations. With
this Mr. McCandless tafkes Issue, v
' "The assurance now that there are
enough hotel accommodations is mis
leading and, according to my experi
ence with the hotels, the statements
the hotels make now are not correct,"
says McCandless. "I have recently
had some personal, acquaintance with
conditions. As Honolulu knows, we
have succeeded in securing a visit
from a large body of the Knights
Templar of San Francisco Command
ery. with the probability that other
Knights of the coast will join this, ex
cursion, which is to arrive here Feb
ruary 19.
"They have taken 100 rooms on the
Great Northern but, I have been abso
lutely unable to provide accommoda
tions for them when they arrive in
February. I talked with the manage
ments of the Territorial Hotel Com
pany and the Pleasanton Hotel and
over my signature will state that 1
could not get assurances' of one room
for that party. ;
'It is not sufficient to say that
when tho time' comes they will be
taken care of. The facts are that the
hotels know- they are going to be so
full that they will not guarantee any
rooms, v ;
"Hotel accommodations mean or.
ought to mean accommodations that
the prospective visitor can be sure of.
Otherwise they are not Justified in
coming to Honolulu. It is not right to
try to stow away parties such as these
of the Knights Templar anywhere
they can be hastily put the day the
steamer arrives.
"I am also informed on good au
thority that the Moana Hotel has had
to inform something like 100 Inquir
ers that nothing could be guaranteed
that rooms could not be reserved
for the period they wished to come.
As a result of my belief that there
will not be adequate accommodations
in February unless something Tadical
is done, I have taken up the proposi
tion of having the Knights Templar
stay aboard the Great Northern while
she is In port. It Is absolutely wrong
for us to take a chance that-there will
be rooms somewhere when our visit
ors come."

MAY BE PROBED
Daring Scheme js Further Told
By Japanese and Federal
Officials May Act,
An interesting and somewhat dif
ferent yeision of the alleged "skin"
game in an opium transaction among
several Honolulu Japanese as pub
lished yesterday in the StarrBulletin
was given out today by a prominent
Japanese, who says his story is. now
common knowledge among his coun
trymen. The Star-Bulletin's informer credits
the plot of selling opium, playing po
liceman and later grabbing both the-
opium and the money, to Fukagawa.
I wnose repuiaiion wiiu iue iwiie w
I net the best. The story is that Fuka-
igawa obtained .'0 tins of opium, said
to be worth $2."00, from a local Chi
nese; offered Kaitsu " per cent com
mission to sell it and then rushed into
Kaitsu's place in Kakaako December
10, when the deal was nearly closed;
frightened the prospective buyers
away and made off with the opium
and the money.
A meeting was held in a local office
Wednesday with Kaitsu, his wife, and
the five Japanese who had each put
up $2i)i to buy the opium on a specula
tion. it is said that Fukagawa had
reduced his price to $2000 and had
agreed to take $1000 down ($200
from each of the five). Fukagawa
was then called into Wednesday's
meeting and accused by Mrs. Kaitsu
of being the man who frightened the
buyers away and appropriated the
spoils. Following the accusation Fu
kagawa went directly to the X'nited
States marshal's office.
"The give Japenese were sitting in
Kaitsu's room with $10O in a bag
ready to pay for the opium in a box
nearby when they heard footsteps on
the porch.", says the Star-Bulletin in
former. "Suddenly the door was kick
ed in, one of the five was knocked
ever, and they all dashed from the
house. Airs. Kaitsu was in an ad
joining room, and peeked behind the
door to see Fukagawa taking away
the money and the opium."
That the case undoubtedly will be .
presented to the federal grand jury is!
the opinion of the V. S. attorney's Of
fice. The Star-Bulletin is informer ;
that a hui of three Japanese had been
formed . to purchase the opium, and
that the district attorney's office has
in its possession the written state
ments of the members of the hui.

noon handed down an opinion sustain
