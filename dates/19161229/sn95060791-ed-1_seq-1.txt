All
Sprinkle Streets With Booze
In order to make a complete
cleanup of all the business of the
office before turning it over to
his successor on the first of Jan
uary, Sheriff Jeff Adams applied
to the superior court for an or
der to destroy the whisky and
beer in his possession which the
took charge of with the arrest of
bootleggers.
The order was granted, and
Friday at 11 o'clock has been set
as the time when it will be trans
ferred from the bottles which
contain it now to one of the
citv's sprinkling- carts and
sprinkled on the streets.
This has been decided on as a
much more satisfactory way of
disposing of it than to empty it
bodily in one place in the street.
The whisky is mostly in pint
bottles, which will be emptied
one by one into the sprinkling
cart, and when all are emptied
the wagon will be driven over
the streets with the valve open,
that the contents may be spread
far and wide on the city's thor
oughfares. A large quantity of beer is
included in the intoxicants con
fiscated, and all will be placed in
the sprinkler together, and it is
estimated that it will about fill
one of the 500-gallon wagon3.

Wealthy Resident of Concho Killed
(St. Johns Observer, Dec. 24.)
This morning about 10 o'clock
Nasis Tamer, accompanied by
Fermín Candelaria and his little
son. left St. Johns in Mr. Tamer's
8-cy Under Cadillac car for Snring
eryille. Upon reaching the cor
ner south of Stansell Greer's
home, about two miles from
town, the car was going too fast
to make the sharp turn. Seeing
he was about to run off the em
bankment straight ahead, Mr.
Tamer twisted the steering wheel
sharply to the left and the big
car turned over into the ditch.
Mr. Tamer was killed instantly,
his neck and left jaw being
broken, while Mr. Candelaria and
his little boy escaped without a
scratch. It is said the car was
going at the rate f about thirty
miles an hour.
Nasis Tamer has been a resi
dent of Apache county for over
20 years and has accumulated a
considerable fortune in his sheep
and mercantile business. He is
reputed to be one of the wealth
iest citizens of Concho.
He is about 41 years of age.
His remains, after being pre
pared at the residence of Monico
Garcia, were taken to the family
home in Concho this afternoon.

Gov. Spry Escapes Assassination
A dynamite bomb was placed
against the Utah governor's resi
dence last Sunday night by an
unknown person. A heavy fall
of snow during the night pre
vented an explosion of the bomb,
otherwise the house would have
been wrecked. Gov. Spry was
away from home that night, hav
ing been delayed by a railroad
blockade, but the members of
his family were in the house, and
all would have been killed had
the bomb exploded.
The outrage is supposed to
have been perpetrated by mem
bers of L W. W., who have re
peatedly threatened Gov. Spry,
since he declined to stop the in
fliction of the death penaly upon
Joseph Hillstrom, a member of
that order who was executed for
murder about a year ago.
Rewards aggregating $5,000
have been offered for the appre
hension of the culprits who placed
the bomb.
No Legal Fee Required
"Editor of the Winslow Mail
has filed his editorial brief in the
election contest. He agrees with
Dwight and Charlie, hence there
are three of a kind. Lawyers
frequently break into print but
only an egotist will attempt to
instruct the court unless he gets
legal fee." Phoenix Mes
senger.
No legel fee is required to get
an editorial brief out of the edi
tor of the Mail. He can be de
pended upon to argue the case,
instruct the court and render a
verdict. His egotism is colossal,
and his discretion is nil. Evi
dently he has never read that
"Fools rush m where angels
fear to tread."
The Yaer's Sheep Supply
October receipts of sheep at
western markets were heavy, all
the principal points showing
gain over the corresponding per
iod last year. The big gain was
at Chicago which had a heavy
run from Montana and was back
in the feeder business, from
which it was excluded by quaran
tine last year. Omaha passed
the half-million mark and Kan
sas City made a good showing.
The only decrease was at Sioux
City, which can hardly be con
sidered a sheep mart of magni
tude. Denver came to the front
as a leading primary point. The
year's receipts show gain at Chi
cago, Kansas City, and St.
Louis, but decreases elsewhere.

Hunt-Campbell Election Contest
(Arizona Gazette, Dec. 28.)
With the Maricopa county in
spection of ballots complete the
Hunt contest looks decidedly
wobbly. The governor's claims
of hundreds of mismarked ballots
have been found to be entirely
without foundation. The in
spection is proving tremendously
expensive, but it is said will be
continued.
There is an unconfirmed rumor
that Senator Ives, chief counsel
for the governor has intimated
that Hunt will have to be pried
loose from his office by legal pro
cess.
No statement as to Hunt's
plans has been made, and a deep
impenetrable silence overhangs
the state house during the closing
hours of the administration.
The present plan calls for Gov
ernor-elect Campbell to take the
oath of office before the chief
justice of the supreme court
Saturday morning. This will be
filed at once with the secretary
of state.
Monday morning at 10 o'clock,
the new governor will deliver his
inaugural address from the capí
tol proticol. This will be short,
and will briefly outline his policy.
The presiding officer of this
function has not been selected.
Judge Sloan, the last territorial
and republican governor of Ari
zona, may be the man, if Gov.
Hunt refuses to serve.
Immediately following the in
augural the governor will pro
ceed to the executive chambers
where it is expected he will be
met by the retiring governor and
the affairs of the office turned
over to him.
Should Hunt decide to retain
physical possession of the office
the courts will be invoked, and
a dispossess proceeding institut
ed. In any event on and after high
noon next Monday Tom Camp
bell will be governor of Arizona.

and had been a resident of this
locality for about 40 years. Her
husband died seyeral years ago.
Since that time she had resided

daughter survive their mother,
out of a family of five children.
Mrs. McAllister's husband was
a charter member 01 the winsiow
lodge of Elks and at his death
was buried by that order in
Winslow. It was Mrs. McAl
lister's wish that she be burieQ
by her husband's side and this
was done Thursday, the Elks
taking charge of the services.
The remains were accompanied
to Winslow Thursday morning
by the daughter. Miss Mercy
McAllister, Miss Rose Scorse and
John Divelbess.
