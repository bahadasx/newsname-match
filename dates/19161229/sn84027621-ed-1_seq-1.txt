The Germans attempted last night
to penetrate tne rrencn lines oetween

the Ger-

The Teutons are still active in Ru
mania. Berlin announced the capture
of several positions, and said that
1400 prisoners were taken yesterday.
The Teuton ic advance was said to be
twenty kilometers 'northwest of Rim-
nik-Sarata. Ratchelun in Dobrudja
was captured. The Teutons are still
pounding at the Matchin bridgehead.
Thev apparently hope to drive the
last of the Rumanians out of the Dob

Teutonic forcep at a point where they
can close the lower Danube to Rus
sians and open a way for an invasion
of Bessarabia.
AT THE TEMPLE THIS EVENING
House to be Crowded to Its
. ' Full Capacity
Coburn's minstrels arrived in Ocala
this morning. They will play at the
Temple tonight and from the looks of
the chart jxt the Court Pharmacy, the
house will be crowded to its full ca
pacity. The company played at Gainesville
last night and the Sun says of the
performance:
Coburn's Greater Minsterels played
to a capacity house at the Baird last
night, and to say that Coburn pleased I
this year better than ever before is J
to say that this favorite minstrel ag-son,
gregation outdid itself last night. The I
large audience went away perfectly I
delighted with every act on the pro
gram. This is one show that is assur
ed of a cordial welcome upon every
return to this city.
Every member of the company is
an artist who knows how to delight 1
.
an audience and swing it off its feet
in vociferous applause. The solos, I
quartets and choruses were all very
fine, and the singing of each one cap-
-
tured the audience.
There was not a coarse or objec-1

quested me as president of the Board
of Trade to call as mass meeting of
the business men of.Ocala to meet at
the courthouse on Friday evening, the
above named gentlemen will ascertain
from the citizens of Ocala whether
or not they desire the railroads to
arrange tourist passenger tickets
wit.li norrmts t.n stnn oflF at Ocala for
three or four days either going to or
coming from South Florida tourist
towns. This will not be a Board of
Trade meeting as quite , a number of
our hotel men and business men do
not belong to the Board of Trade, but
to be a meeting of men who will be
most benefited by the tourist who
stop over in Ocala. The meeting is
hereby called at 6:45 o'clock Friday
evening, 29th of December. Come if
you are interested.

Don't put off working. Remember

but steady efforts beats a brilliant

time in telling what you can do. Put
it to actual accomplishment which
speaks for itself. Deeds are what

Washington, Dec. 29. Every able

not made public until yesterday.
The militia bureau directs that
where a National Guard regiment is
called for war service, reserve train
ing battalions to fill the vacancies at
the front must be organized out of
the National Guard reserve and vol

tinues, "If for any reason there shall
not be enough reservists or enough

scribed strength a sufficient number
of unorganized militia will be drafted

ALSATIANS FILLED
WITH ENTHUSIASM
Rejoice to Find Themselves Again
Citizens of the French
Republic .
With the French Armyin Alsace,
Dec. 15 (Correspondence of the As
sociated Press) French has replaced
Alsatian dialect and German as the
laiguage in that portion of Alsace
restored to France as the result of
French military successes. So soon
as the blue-clad soldiers occupied the!
villages and towns German signs were
torn down from the fronts of the
stores and replaced by French. Finger
posts along the roads were altered
and directions at grade crossings over
the " railroad tracks were" changed.
Restaurant bills of farewe,re written
in French instead of German. The
titles of public' offices were painted
over and new 'designations put in
their places. Prices also were trans
igin and fled with the German troops,
marks and pfennigs.
Most of the municipal officials un
der German rule were of Prussian or
igin and ed with thefl German troops.
The other male inhabitants most of
them very old or very yojmg, as all
those of military age had been either
taken into the German army or had
fled to France had never had exper
ience of local government and were
incapable of undertaking the public
utilities or caring for the health or
sanitary condition of the people. It
was found necessary to appoint
French administrators and these were
chosen from among officers who had
been wounded in the war or who had
fallen sick during the campaign. In
one locality a military mayor was
nominated. He was a captain Who
had lost his right arm in battle. For
two years he has carried out the f unc
tions of his office and so successfully
that the citizens governed by him de
clare they have never been more wise
ly ruled. .
One of the first tasks undertaken
was to set in motion the educational
system which had been interrupted by
the hostilities. Classes were formed
for the children of both sexes and
these were placed in the charge of
sisters of a religious order which de
votes itself to education. There was
some difficulty1 at first owing to the
pupils knowing no other language
than their local dialect. They showed
such zeal, however, in acquiring
French, that within a few weeks the
teachers were able to carry on the
lessons. When Prince Arthur of
Connaught recently visited the classes
he was amazed at the change brought
about in so short a time.
French officials and the people of
Alsace themselves ascribe the readi
ness of the Alsatians to adopt French
ideas and education to the fact that
they have in part Realized their dream
of being rejoined to France. At any
rate, it is a patent fact that, although
they are still within sound of the
German guns, everybody in the re
conquered territory at present speaks
French. The children at their games
on the streets use nothing but French
expressions. Workmen and work
women going to and from the factor
ies and while engaged there rarely-
and then only in the case of elderly
people who cannot change their life
long habits utter a word in anything
except French. In the cafes and ho
tels and in the stores French is every
where used, while in the churches the
sermons are now preached in French

M 0 RE MAXWELLS
Another Dozen of those Reliable and
Classy Cars Has
Arrived
The Maxwell agency received at
noon today via Palatka and the Okla
waha Valley railroad two huge Mich
igan Central steel automobile cars,
something never seen in Ocala before,
each double-decked and containing
six Maxwell automobiles. The Max
well service force is busily engaged
in unloading the cars, more than half
of which are already sold.
The Ocala agency ordered forty
eight Maxwells shipped out during
this month, taking advantage of the
present low price and the last of the
sixty-inch tread cars, but the factory
will be unable to make shipment of so
many.
IDEAL WILL BE OPEN
EVERY EVENING
The Ideal restaurant, which has for
the past year been conducted by Mr.

lia street opposite the courthouse,
changed hands today, Mrs. Mary
Basha having purchased it. It will be
under the management of Mr. S.
Demetre.
It is now quite a narrow room, but
the partition will be moved to the
center of the building which will
make quite a comfortable restaurant,
allowing an abundance 4 of room for
two roms of tables instead of one, as
in the past.
The Ideal will be kept open nights
until 12 o'clock, and the new manage
ment will make a specialty of serving
oysters in every known style.
