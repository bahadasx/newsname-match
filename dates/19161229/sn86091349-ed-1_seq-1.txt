THE
OCME
P
ESTABLISHED SEP'T 17, 1870,
Pioche Has Shared
The people of Pioche have much
to he thankful for. The camp pro
duced more ore during the year
1916, than any previous year in ita
history and the outlook for a great
er production in 1917 is decidedly
flattering. While we have not the
figures at hand showing the output
of the mines during the year draw
ing to a close; yet we have it from
a source entirely trustworthy that
the shipment of ore from Pioche
Ktation since January 1st, a year
ago, will exceed 3,000 carloads. Of
course, the Prince Consolidated has
maintained its premiership in the
amount of tonnage, with the Amal
gamated Pioche and Uvada Copper
companies coming next. One of the
important improvements of the year
in a mining way was the construction
of the Consolidated Nevada-Utah
mill, and which has demonstrated
Itself to he one of the most success
ful plants ever built in the state of
Nevada. The oil floatation process
is an important feature of the mech
anism of this plant and has solved
some problems, which, one time,
seemed to he impossible to wrest the
values from the vast bodies of com
plex ores which exist in the Consol
idated Nevada-1'tah and Amalgamat
ed Pioche properties. The success
of the mill has encouraged the com
pany to broaden its scope of opera
tions and plans are now being made
to not only add greater equipment
to the mine but also to add other
units to the present mill.
The Prince Consolidated company
has kept up a steady production
throughout the year and lias added
greatly to the available tonnage in
the mine. The company spent large
sums In the construction of the new
mill at Bulllonville where several
million dollars of assets in the Bull
iouville and Dry Valley tailings will
be converted into cash. The com
pany is planning to install equipment
at the mine sometime in the future
to handle the vast bodies of low
grade ores which come under the
shipping grade.
KALT LAKE ROUTE GIVES
BONUS OF FIVE PER CENT
General Manager 11. C. Nutt of the
Salt Lake Iioute has sent out the
following notice to agents at all sta
tions: "Our board of directors has
authorized the payment of a bonus of
five per cent of their earnings for the
present year to all employes who,
on December 31, 1916 have been In
the employ of the company a year or
more and hav.e earned $1,800 a year,
or leas. This is not intended as a
Christmas) present but an extra pay
ment for services, made on account
of exceptional conditions, which,
while they have materially increased
the earnings of the company, have
also increased the cost of living to
a point of hardship upon the lower
paid employes of the company."

ception (ISPS) last month was the

NEVADA POTATOES HAVE
TAKEN GRAND PRIZE
Nevada potatoes beat the western
world, If competition and its results
at the Panama-California exposition
at San Diego are any criterion.
Thef Wood-Curtis company of this
city made an exhibit of Burbanks,
Russete and Rurals, all grown In
the vicinity of Reno, at the San
Diego exposition and each class won
first prize In" the competition and
the whole exhibit won the grand
aavi mime? cAuiuit . nui luu &ruilll
prize from Idaho, Washington, Ore-
Hon and California. Reno Journal,
The organization of the Hamburg
Mines company and the opening up
of some extensive bodies of high
grade ore in the Highland district of
this property, is one of the Important
events of the past year. This com
pany plans to operate upon a much
larger scale during 1917. The re
sumption of operations at the old
Mendha property, was another event
of importance during the past year.
At Bristol, the developments in the
properties of the Uvada Copper com
pany, have- far exceeded expectations
and the greatest handicap that the
company experiences at the pres
ent time jla inadequate hoisting fa
cilities. However, improvements
along this line are contemplated
during the next year.
The closing of a deal a few days
ago for the purchase of the Highland
Queen, with properties adjacent to
the Hamburg, is considered to be an
important event and will probably
mean the opening of another prop
erty equally as good as the Ham
burg. The Atlanta-Home Miniing com
pany at Atlanta has succeeded In
opening up some tremendous bodies
of low grade ores. There is estimat
ed to be actually blocked out in this
mine at least 1,000,000 tons of ore
upon which is placed a value of any
where from $7,000,000 to $10,000,
000. The company Is going to Install
a big milling plant early next year
and unless jail signs fail, Atlanta will
be one of the most prosperous camps
In Nevada within the next few
months. The vastness of the ore
bodies at Atlanta is still an un
known quantity; but the Atlanta
company has gone ahead to the ex
tent that its officers have satisfied
themselves that they have one of the
biggest gold propositions in the west.
The foregoing are just a few or
the things which indicate that the
future of Pioche looks brighter than
it ever has at any time in its history.
Then there are the stockraising
and farming resources of the coun
to which play an important part in
our prosperity.

Selects
The question as to who will be
the Pioche deputy for Sheriff Nes

a number of applicants for the Job;
but of course there could be only
one lucky man and that lucky man
Is none other than John Ewing; who
has already had experience in serv
ing as a peace officer in Lincoln
county. He Is', therefore, well Qual
ified to fill the position and tho new
sheriff is counting upon him for an
able and capable lieutenant.

of the deputy at Caliente has been

COPPERMINES CO. WILL
DOUBLE MILLING CAPACITY
The first 500-ton unit of tho flota
tion plant of Coppermines company
Is expected to be completed and go
into commission soon after the first
of next month, and now comes the
cheering information that a contract
has been let to the General Engi
neering company of Salt Lake to
immediately commence the erection
of the second unit of the i
with the same capacity as that Of
the first. It Is expected that the
second unit will be completed nsd
n operation by early spring, after
hich the management will be able
to
treat 1000 tons of ore dailv
through its own plant, in addition to
tonage which is handled daily by
the Nevada Consolidated from its
Ora claim, adjoining Liberty Pit. It
is also the intent of the management
to soon commence the shipping of a
lousiderable tonnage of oxide and
carbonate ores to the Tooele smelt
ers in Utah. This ore will nmrn
from the Old Glory, Taylor, C.lroux
and Alpha shafts.
The last statement of the company
tor the year ending April 30, 1916,
showed a total and partially devel
oped ore reserve of 25,867,850 tons,
since that time a large amount of
churn drilling has been done, with
the result that several million tons
of additional ore have been demon
strated.
From present indications Copper-
mines company is now about to take
its place as a producer of consider
able importance in the mining world
With proper equipment, which now
seems to have been definitely deter
mined upon, the future of the com
pany seems to be fully assured.

CLARK COUNT SELLS
BONDS AT NICE PREMIUM
The Las Vegas Age of last week
contained the information that Clark
county had sold its road and bridge
bonds to a Denver firm at a premium
of $3,000. The voters of the coun
ty authorized the sale of $50,000
worth of these bonds and the fact
that the purchasers were willing to
pay $53,000 for them is evidence
that Nevada road and bridge bond
are considered to be a good Invest
ment.

will be equally successful In pluc

Sometime ago dogs at the Kix

latter had become entangled in a
wire fence. The appearance of the
animal, and the fact that it was an
unusual thing for a coyote to come
so close to the ranch house, aroused
the suspicions pf the Klxmiller fam
ily that it might be afflicted'with the
rabies.
To make cock-sure of it, the head
of the coyote was severed and ship

telegram advised that the Kixmlllers
were correct. Meanwhile, a careful
watch was kept on one of the dogs
which had been bitten, which bettan
