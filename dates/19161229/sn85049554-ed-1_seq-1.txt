London, Dec. 29.—The Spectator de

Ttaffie Is Overcome.
[Correspondence Associated Press.]
Panama, Dee. 4.—The slides In Gail
lard cut which have been menacing
navigation have been overcome. Today
the channel Is in better shape than it
has ever been before. For a minimum
width of ISO feet it is thirty-Ave feet
deep, and it is at least thirty feet deep
clear across the original prism, 300
feet wide. The slides at Cucaracha
and Culebra which have bulged for
ward as If to smother the waterway
under their mass have been dredged
away until they look Aat and Impotent
Barring some unforeseen development,
such as a new break In a wholly unex
pected place or the crumbling of the
great cliffs of brecca at Gold HU1 or
Contractors Hill, the Interruptions of
traffic by the slides are done.
The englneers-*lli charge will not
commit themselves^to prophecy but
they say the Cut te ln the best shape it
was ever In, and the fact that they
have taken away all but three of the
dredges and cut out the Sunday and
holiday work Is a strong Indication of
their confidence in the situation. The
three dredges are carrying the excava
tion back of the original channel line
in order to establish a defensive zone to
prevent encroachments on the channel.
Much work is yet to be done to com
plete the channel to its full width of
300 feet with a bottom forty feet abovq
sea level, giving a depth of forty-Ave
feet, but It Is already possible now to
give passage to the biggest ships on
the seas without any trouble.

Reply Lengthy and Not so Short and
Sharp as Some Desired—French So­
cialists Demand More Vigorous War
Policy—Spain Protests to Germany.
London, Dec. 29.—As a result of the
conferences which liave been in pro
gress for several days, the entente re
ply to the German note is now com
plete. It should go forward today or
tomorrow except for the formality of
transmitting it to all the allies before
the final delivery. This means the de
livery will be made next wee'.:, perhaps
on Wednesday.
The delivery will be made at Paris,
after which the communica'.ion will be
forwarded to Germany tiuM American
channels.
F^pply Is Lengthy.
The reply is a very long document,
much more lengthy than the German
note. This point has b.ien one of Uie
matters of discussion during the con
ferences, the objection having been
raised that it Is too long and should
be short and sharp. The presence here
of Alexandre Rlbot. the French finance
minister, permitted the French minis
try to be represented during the confer
ences.
Unusual optimism is shown here as
a result of the final form which the
reply has taken. It Is believed to be
such that it will meet with satisfaction
at Washington.
The reply to the American note will
follow within a few days after the de
livery of'the reply to Germany.
COMBAT UNDERSEA WARFARE.
Spanish Cabinet to Take Energetic
Measures to Protect Commerce.
Paris. Dec. 29.—A Havas dispatch
frofn Madrid says the Spanish cabinet
has decided, to ..take eneirg£lic ,measii res
to avoid the constant dimunltion of rhe
country's merchant marine. Another
meeting will be held to give precise
form to the measures, the. nature ol'
which have not been disclosed.
Spain Protests to Germany.
Washington, Dec. 29.—iSpain's action
-toward the German submarine cam
paign caused surprise here because no
vigorous statement from Spain had
been expected. Spain's actim neverthe
less is thought to have come at an op
portune time to add another source of
pressure on Germany in what the state
department considers a most serious
situation.
Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Hol
land have also suffered disastrously
from submarine activities, but no indi
cation has been given as yet that they
also were planning action at this time.
The United States will welcome such
protest by other neutrals but in line
with Its consistent policy will probably
not join In any united action with
them.
French Socialists Loyal.
Paris, Dec. 29.—A resolution has been
adopted by the socialist congress call
ing on the government to pursue a
more vigorous policy both in military
and economic action so that the full
resources of the country may be
brought into play and the war termi
nated more speedily.
The resolution is predicated on the
assertion that the replies of the central
powers to President Wilson's note leave
no doubt that the offer of peace nego
tiations was a snare.
Deputies who met German and oth
er foreign socialist delegates at the
conference in Switzerland supported a
motion In favor of resumption of in
ternational relations among socialists.
The proposal was defeated by a small
majority.
Pope Not Aaked to Intervene.
Rome, via Paris, Dee. 29.—The Os
scrvatore Romano, the official organ of
the Vatican, prints today an official de
nial of reports published abroad that
the papal nuncio at Vienna informed
the Vienna press that the Austrian em
peror had requested him to ask Pope
Benedict's intervention for peace and
that the pope had given a favorable re
ply.

modification of the protocol covering

ranza's insistence on the unconditional
retirement of the American forces is
not so strong as formerly, chiefly be
cause of the new military situation in
northern Mexico. Neither does he
flatly repudiate the protocol already

ficient number of the unorganized

ser unit at the prescribed strength."
The national guard regulations,

them to serve three more In the re

They will hold the same rank In the
reserve that they held at the timo of
furloughs from activo service except
that when drafted Into the federal
service they will report in the grade of

has never disappeared since Its Intro
duction here in 190G. The Indications
are that the community that suffers
severely one year may ewupe the next.
Prior to lHOt. this disease established
a home In northern Kurope. In 1S16
something happened to change this.
That year tho disease migrated and
came here, and at the same time ex
tended over lCuropean countries which
had prior to that been free of it. It
Ih tho first time in the history of any
disease that an epidemic has circum
navigated tho globe.
"One of the puzzles of this disease is
that the term infantile paralysis Is not
correct. It is a misnomer because the
disease can appear without any paraly
sis whatever residting. Paralysis is
merely an incident of the disease. Dur
ing the recent epidemic more person.1"
hail It and were not paralyzed than had
It and were paralyzed."
