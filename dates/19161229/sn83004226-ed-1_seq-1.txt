ONE WORD INVALIDATES DEED.
Failure to change a word In a deed
Invalidated a sale of land to John W.
Hcolt In Plke-co. made more thnn ten
years ago. The Court of appeals de
cided Scott did not have a title to the
land.
frit Scott deeded a tract of land In
Plke-co. "to Prlcy Scott and her bod
ily heirs by Crit Bcotu" At the time of
this conveyance Crit Scott was threat -ened
with a stilt for alleged slander.
and Its purpose was to remove slander,
and Its purpose was to remove from his
possession any property subject to ex
ecution. After the tlmo passed for the
slander suit tho words "to ITicy Scott
and her bodily heirs by Crit Bentr'were
erased and the words "their hclnTwore
lns.Tted In their place. Tho person
making the change In the deed failed,
however, to correct the other word
ing of tho deed, which provided that
the property should go to the wife and
then to "her" heirs.
The children of IUcy Scott sued for
this property after their father and
mother had sold It to John W. Sco.tt,
and the Court to-day held that they
were entitled to recover the property.
The proceedings of the Court for to
day were the following:

BOOZE FIGHTING.
For the married man who thinks he
cannot get along without drink, the
following is suggested as a means of
freedom from bondage to the saloon:
Start a saloon In your own home. Re
the only customer (you'll have no li
cense to pay.) Oive your wife two dol
lars extra to buy a gallon of whiskey,
and remember there are sixty-nine
drinks In a gallon. Buy your drinks
from no one but your wife and by the
time the first gallon Is gone she will
have our dollars and fifty cents to
put Into the bank and two dollars tc
start business again. (She can throw
!n some drinks on the house.) Should
vou live ten years and continue to buy
bonze from her, and then die with
snakes In your boots, she will have
enough .money to bury you decently,
edurate your children, buy a house and
lot, marry a decent man, and quit
thinking about you entirely.

GERMANY PROPOSES
lEIISG OF POWERS
PERMANENT PEACE PROPOSITION
TO COME AFTERWARD,
HOWEVER.
The German Government, In Its re
ply to President Wilson's recent noles
to the European belligerents, proposes
an Immediate conference of all the war
ring nations to discuss peace terms.
The task of preventing future wars,
the official statement says, can be be
gun only after the end of the present
struggle. This point will probably be
the greatest barrier to a peace agree
ment. ..
Washington, Dec. 26. Germany's re
ply to President Wilson', note is re
garded here as having; advanced the
peace movement Another step despite
the fact that It disappoints In not meet
ing hs suggestion for an avowal of
terms.
The reception or Germany's reply re
ceived among the entente allies, whose
statesmen have publicly declared
against such a program, now becomes
the point upon which a further move
Is hinged. The German note is prob
ably the prelude or a series or care
fully considered delicate moves In the
great game of world diplomacy, ail
possibly leading to an approach for a
real discussion of peace - terms on
grounds which all the belligerents may
feel can place them to no disadvant
age." .
Neutral diplomatlo quarters, too, re
garded the note as a step toward
peace, and farther leaned to the view
that Germany might follow It with a
confidential communication of some
sort outlining her terms.
Note Not Full Reply.
The view of the entente allied em
bassies, frankly expressed was that the
note was not an answer to President
Wilson's communication but rather a
document for circulation in Germany
and in neutral countries with the ob
ject of moulding opinion to place the
responsibility for continuing the war
on the entente. . ;
Among the Germanic diplomats the
only view expressed was one of sur
prise that the reply had preceded re
ceipt of the entente's response to Ger
many's original peace proposal of De
cember 12.
It was everywhere agreed that the
principal stricking point was the 'ac'.t
ot a definite statement of terms such
as President Wilson asked and such
would require if they were not to put
their "heads in a nose with the rope
end In the hands of tho GermanB." It
Is not beyond the realm of diplomacy,
however, to And a way to bridge that
difficulty, and Germany's failure Is not
regarded aa a block to the negotiations
although It makes them exceedingly
difficult.
Germany's declaration that she re
gards the work of securing the world
against future wars as a work to be
taken up after the present conflict is
ended was regarded with a diversity
of opinion.
Not Out of Harmony.
Officials who turned back and com
pared the statement with the phrases
of President Wilson's note did not find
the two out of harmony nor in dis
agreement with the President's pub
lic utterances on a world league to
preserve peace: yet there was an In
definable opinion abroad in olflelul
quarters that the ending of the war
and the safeguarding of the future
were problems so Inseparable that one
depended on the other.Those taking this
view referred to Lloyd-George's dec
laration that the Allies would consid
er it possible to enter a conference only
If Germany would first openly offer
"reparation, restitution and guaran
tees." The German reply is regarded as not
only falling to do this, but it's sug
gestion that the work be left for the
future. It is feared, may raise a diffi
cult obstacle for the allied statesmen
to surmount with their own people to
whom nn absolutely durable peace has
been held out as one of the main justi
fications of the war. It also has been
sheafed by the allied statesmen with
the terms which would end the conflict.-
