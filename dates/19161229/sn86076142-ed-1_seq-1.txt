A remarkable achievement was the

that almost zero weather prevailed
while the power was off, the mill was
started without accident or delay as

OPTIMISM PREVAILS
Br Aaaoclated Prcaa.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 29. A policy
of absolute silence regarding the
peace negotiations has been adopted
by President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing. It is stated officially that
all steps henceforth will be regarded
as confidential, that no comment will
be made on any development and
that rumors will not be discussed in
any way.
The decision to pursue this course
was made known after the state de
partment., had received the official
texts of the German and Australian
replies to President Wilson's Identic
notes to the belligerents proposing
a discussion of peace terms, and after
it was learned that the Teutonic
powers would be willing to permit a
confidential exchange of tentative
terms If it became necessary to do so
to bridge the gap threatening to
prevent a gathering of peace dele-
Bates.
In many quarters the official atti
tude was construed as indicating that
secret exchanges were expected to
follow it they did not precede the
formal answei" c the entente na
tions to the notes of President Wilson
and the central powers. Because of
the highly confidential nature of any
such negotiations, It Is pointed out,
the Intermediary ' would be obliged
to refrain from admitting even that
J they were in progress.

(Br Aaaoclatcd Prcaa.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 29. The
president has tentatively agreed with
administration leaders in congress on
a bond Issue to meet - part of -the
treasury deficit confronting the gov
ernment for - the fiscal . year ending
June, 1918, estimated at about $180,
000,000. With Secretary McAdoo, the
president is working on other plans
for raising additional revenue.
In agreeing to approve a bond issue
to meet the government deficit, the
president pointed out that the bonds
should' be used to meet the tem
porary, emergency expenditures. The
Mexican situation caused many of
these.
The treasury already has authority
by previous acts of congress to issue
Panama canal bonds tor borrowing
purposes at three per cent. About
$240,000,000 of these are available.
Plans for raising other revenue, tt
is understood, will concern the in
