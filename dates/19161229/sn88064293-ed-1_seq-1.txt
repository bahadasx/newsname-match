When the municipal light plant in

thought that it would take only two

I from New Orleans, but upon investi
gation it was found that the parts
could not be supplied by the house in
New Orleans and it became neces-'by
sary to order the repairs font Cleve
land, Ohio, end according to a Ber
wick business man it will be about
ten days before th juice can be
turned on again.

the accident happened while he
gone. He thinks that perhaps had he
remained in the plant he would have

out to telephone on account of the
noise in the plant wTiich makes tele
phone conversation difficult.

TIMBER AND OIL MAN, ACCI
DENTALLY SHOT, NEAR
DEATH. I
- « —
Baton Rouge, La., Dec. 28.—Acci-:
dentally discharging a revolver which ;
was packed away in his baggage
while opening his suit case, A. A. :
Waterhouse, aged 38, St. Martinville, i
La., a timber and oil operator, shot
and probably fatally wounded him
self in a room in the Istrouma Hotel
at 9:15 this morning.
Waterhouse was preparing to
leave the hotel and go to Plaquemine,
by automobile to look over some
timber lands, when the accident oc
curred. One of his employes and a
negro bell boy were with him at the
time. When he was going out of the
door of his room, Waterhouse dis
covered that he had left his brush on
the dresser and proceeded to open
the suit case to put it in. In some
manner, the hammer of the loaded
pistol was caught in the cover of the
suit case and was discharged.
ARCADE THEATRE IS NEW
NAME FOR PLAYHOUSE
The name contest conducted by
the management of the picture show
on Railroad Avenue was closed on
December 22nd and the decision of
the judges was announced on the
screen last night. Out of a large
number of titles selected, the
name "Arcade" appeared to the
judges to be-Jthe best, and Emmet
Francioni who suggested the name
was awarded the $5.00 in gold offer
ed to the successful contestant. The
second prize was awarded to Robert
Gillen who thought the name The
Avenue came the nearest to filling
the bill. The reputation of the house
as the New Theatre has been pretty
well established, so no doubt there
will be many people who will call it
for that name for a time, but offi
cially from this time it is the Arcade.

We Hope Fire Won't Come

does you should be prepared
for the consequences. It
seems to us s<> foolish when a
man says he doesn't need tire
insurance, that he has never
had a hre and doesn't expect
to have one. When a fire
starts you can never tell
where it will end. Be pre
