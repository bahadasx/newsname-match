MRS. VANDYCK IS
KILLED BY ACCIDENT
Bullet From .22 Calibre Rifle
Penetrates Brain, Caus
ing Death.
Last Friday afternoon at her
home south of Paris, Mrs. Har
ry Vandyck, aged about 85 yeaas,
was killed when a riflle was ac
cidentally discharged. The bul
let entered her brain.
Mrs. Vandyck was engaged in
ironing some clothes in the room
where the riflle was standing by
the door, and it is supposed that
the gun was discharged when
the door was slammed. The
bullet entered her head just be
low the right ear and ranged
downward. No one was in the
room when the accident occurred,
and the whole affair is some
what of a mystery.
When found she was lying be
fore an open fireplace, so near
the fire that her hair had been
singed. She never regained her
speech, and just-how the acci
dent occurred is only a matter of
speculation.
"SOMETHING NEW
UNDER THE SUN"
Community Tree Is So Desig
nated By Citizen Who
Witnessed Exercises
On the evening of Dec. 25
Ultimo, the citizens of Paris be
held a "Thing of Beauty and a
Joy Forever."
It was erected in the center of
Market street near the post of
fice by the Music Club of the
city, and was known'as a "Com
munity Christmas Tree." It
certainly was a beauty. At 7
o'clock this Community Tree was
surrounded by some two thous
and of people of all ages and
sizes, and it could be said, that
the rich and poor gathered to
gether, and it is a truth that God
is the Father of us all.
The spirit of good cheer and
fraternal interest was clearly
felt throughout the vast throng
of men and women and children
who had come to see and hear.
Not a single wave of discord dis
turbed the audience. Even the
very Heavens seemed propitious,
for the post twilight atmosphere
was as calm as an evening sephir
in June. The brilliant electric
lights scintillated from many
colored incandescant bulbs sus
pended about and through the
foliage of the mammoth ever
green tree, which was adorned
with party colored tapestry fes
tooned from limb to limb.
At the hour, Rev. W. H. Ryals
cal'ed the meeting to order, and
Rev. B. B. Lavender read appro
priate scriptures relative to the
birth of Christ at the Hamlet of
Bethlehem of old, and followed
his reading by a time prayer in
voking God's blessings on the
people. The audience, lead by a
cornet, sang "Silent Night" and
"Joy to the World."
-Appropriate remarks were
made by Rev. Ryals and others.
"America" was sung, and the
crowd was dismissed by Rev.
Hancock and went to their homes
filled with a new inspiration of
the meaning of the Christ festi
val. Surely the occasion was a
splendid index to the moral sta-

AT
AN ADVANCED OLD AGE
Mrs. Nancy P. Chilton died at
the, home of her daughter, Mrs.
I. W. Morgan, near Buchanan,
last Wednesday after an illness.
Death was due to the infimities
of age. She was 91 years old.
Mrs, Chilton was the widow
of the late John Chilton of this
county, and was a very estima
ble old lady, attested by her
large circle of friends. She was
a consistent member of the
Methodist church, with her
membership at Bethel.
Mrs. Chilton is survived by
only two children from a family
of thirteen, the ones surviving

tus of Christian society' in our
beautiful town, and shows the
progress made within a decade
or two in the way of celebrating
the holiday.
Within the recollection of most
of this generation, it was the un
iform custom of the people to
spend the days about Christmas
in dissipation and more or less
questionable amusements. That
day has passed inocuous desuet
ude and has been sueceded by a
more rational spirit of praise and
work of the King of Kings and
Lord of Lords. ; -
The good women of the town
and the organization, the Music
Club, are entitled to the credit
of instituting this, the first Com
munity Tree. Long may it wave
over a community that strives
for Peace and good will to all,
and malice toward none.

It is unique in character-drawing,
giving to the stage a Bomewhat

itself to some very effective stage

have given the play an excep
