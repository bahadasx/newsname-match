SEALER TO TALK
BREAD PROBLEMS
WITH CMC CLUB
Mrs. William Henderson, Pres
ident, Invited to Speak on
January 15
"BIT HEAVIEST LOAF !"
Official Advice Theane For Dis
cussion Relative to Possible
Price Advance
City Sealer Harry D. Reel has been
Invited by Mrs. William Henderson,
president of the Civic club, to discuss
Harrisburg's bread problem at the
monthly meeting of the organization
January 16.
"Insist upon having your bretul
weighed and then buy the
heaviest loaf!"
That little solgan which the sealer
himself coined in his advice to house
keepers and others who do the fam
ily buying, will be the theme of his
talk before the city's progressive or
ganisation of women.
City Sealer Heel's "advice" to the
people via the Telegraph last evening
aroused ail kinds of favorable com
ment and the campaign which the
head of the bureau of weights and
measures has adopted to forestall any
defense to support the talked-of raise
In price or reduction of per
loaf early in the new year, was wide
ly commended.
"Weigh Your Broad"
That the Civic club proposes to in
terest itself in the "weigh your bread"
movement was explained to-day by
Mrs. Henderson. "For more than an
hour I talked this matter over with
Mr. Reel and as president of the
Civic club I Invited htm to speak at
the next meeting of the club. Janu
ary 15." said she. "The matter will
he taken up officially by the board of
directors at its meeting January 8.
The only thing I'm sorry for is that
Mr. Reel cannot give us the talk be
fore the first of the year.
"To my mind this is surely a mat
ter upon which the people should be
fully advised. Public sentiment, I've
always thought, can do a great deal
when once aroused.
Their "Money's Worth"
" "Weigh the bread before you pur
chase and then purchase the heaviest
loaf is Mr. Reel's advico. That is the
surest way to bring about a solution
of this problem. People wouldn't ob
ject to paying six cents for a loaf of
bread If they were getting a Joaf that
weighs sixteen ounces. I doubt if
anyone would object to the price
if one got his money's worth.
"I have asked Mr. Reel to talk to
lis on the subject and If possible I'd
like to have Mr. Sweeney, the chief
of the State bureau, and Mr. Bover.
the county sealer there, too.
"Personally I'm tremendous!} 1 in
terested In this matter and I intend
to do all I can to advance this move
ment to 'weigh your bread before you
purchase and then purchase the
heaviest loaf" "

REOPEN HEARINGS "
IN PAPER PROBE
Federal Commission Deter
mined to Find Relief For
Publishers
Washington. D. C., Dec. 29. The
Federal Trade Commission reopened
hearings to-day in its news print paper
investigation, taking up the inquiry
where it was left off two. weeks ago
for study of a distribution plan pro
posed by paper manufacturers. The
plan still i 3 under consideration.
The commission planned to present
again facts concerning costs of paper
manufacture and profits In news print
making. Publishers charged they are I
i paying extortionate prices and that
artificial news print shortage has been
created by the diversion of news print
making machines to other classes of
work. Manufacturers have contended
prices are reasonable and that the
makers are privileged to produce the
Hind of paper that pays the largest
profit.
Commissioner Davies made It clear
at the start of to-day's hearing that
the commission whs determined to ind
.tome relief for publishers.
, J H. Zerby, of Pottsville. Pa., pub-I
Usher, declared it all depended on who I
the publisher was whether he could buy ;
in the open market.
C. S. Andrews, also of Pennsylvania,
declared his competitor in the same
town v/as able to buy paper cheaper
than he. Others who gave similar tes
timony were: H. U. Varner, a North !
Carolina publisher; H. J. Blanton, of
Missouri; Frank P. Glass, vice-presl- I
: dent of the American Newspaper Pub
lishers' Association; W. A. Gracey and
W. L Ostron, both of New York State. '
H E. Trout, representative of Penn- i
sylvania weekly publications, said some i
weeklies were paying ten cents a pound:
for paper and that if present prices con- i
tinued all would have to go out of :
; business. These papers, he said, had ! i
I cut down their circulation and increas- i
ed their prices all they could,
j Jobbers who followed the publishers i '
on the stand, were questioned concern- 1
1 ina: the reasonableness of their prodta. j I

Architects to Build
Harrisburg Hotel Are
Among the Most Notable
Writing under date of December 2R
i to one of the directors of the Harrls-

United Hotels Company, which will

Hotel here, compliments the local com
pany upon the arrangements for a
finely-appointed building. He says:
! "I thina that you have every reason
Ito rest contented relative to the ar
rangement of the architects of the
hotel. Mr. Stoddart has had very con- .
siderable experience in hotel construe- !
Hon, and Mr. Ksenweln stands out as
a premier in economy hotel construc
tion. as well as leading all of his pro- !
fession In the number of hotels de- !
signed and built. You have, therefore
a combination and a form indeed.
"I am sure from past experiences,
that your association with the United
! Hotels Company will prove a most '
pleasant as well as a very valuable !
one to your particular prolect It is
easy to understand that the co-oper- :
\ ative undertaking, such as ours, has a
i very considerable striking force for
j the good of any one of the houses;
within the chain, and must lend to Its
value as an operating unit. 1 shall be l

England May Take
Over Drink Trade to
Raise More Finances
London. Dec. 29. The purchase of
j 'he drink trade In Great Britain by th* j
State is believed to be Imminent, says I
the Daily Express to-day.
"The matter has been closely con- '
sidered by the liquor control board i
| during the last fortnight." continues
| the newspaper. "Several members of i
] the board have long advocated the \
j purchase, and the chance In the gov
! ernment has brought a renewal of
j their arguments."
The Express quotes Sir Thomas I
| Whittaker. member of Parliament, as,
; saying that David Lloyd George, the I
. prime minister, is known to favor the i
I step, while several of the Unionist
' members are understood to agree with i
| him. Sir Thomas says he believes a 1
| bill calling for the purchase would 1
] pass thp House of Commons without i
; difficulty.
Sir Thomas Whlttaker was chair
; man of the committee which advo
cated purchase In 1915 when the cost 1
i of the plan was estimated at between '
250.000,000 and 300,000.000 pounds '
. sterling. Since then, however, the j
Government has interfered drastically!
; with the production of spirits.
! The Dally Express asserts that fur- ;
ther great restrictions In tho manufae- !
ture and sale of alcoholics are certain 11
In the Immediate future whether or j
not the purchase plan is put into ef- i
feet.
It Is known from other sources that ;
i the liquor question has lately become 1
an urgent one for the government in
consequence of the renewed com
plaints of the hindrance of munition
work and other Industries due to ex
cessive drinking, also due to the fact '
that much freightage and vast quan
tities of food material are absorbed In
the liquor Industry. Memorials from
such centers as Birmingham, Liver
pool. Manchester and Glasgow have '
now reached the government warning
of delays In munition, shipbuilding and
similar Industries and urging the total
prohibition.
It may he recalled that Premier
I-lovd Gforjr iirnd the nationalization
of the drink trade In the spring of
1915. hut failed to achieve the success
of the scheme. At that time the plan
wan regarded as impracticable, but
since then it has been strongly advo
cated. and the demand is being con
tinued by a section of the press.

Is this the same Dr. Theodor®
Kharas of Harrisburg, who is betnfj
I sued for absolute divorce by Mrs. Ada

This Is the question Attorney
Thurston Is making every effort to
have answered. For Mr. Thurston is

won.

an "efficiency engineer."
Information coming from Hag
erstown says that the Dr. Kharas

factory for Scotland and has al
ready placed a factory and bank
