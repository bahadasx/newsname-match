II Peace Terms to Start From
Status Quo Before the
War, Says London Spectator
Germans Must Evacuate AD Lands Occupied, Restore Alsace-Lorraine,
Add Polish Prussia and Austrian Poland to New Sub-kingdom and.
Make Reparation for all Ships of Commerce.
London, Dec. 29, 10:30 a. m. As a
result of the conferences which have
been in progress for several days,, the
entente reply to the German note i3
now completed. It could go forward
today or tomorrow except for the nec
essary formality of transmitting it to
all the allies before final deliver'.
This means thaj; the delivery will be
made early in or in the middle of
next week, perhaps on Wednesday.
J The delivery will be made at Paris,
after which the communication will
be forwarded to Germany through
American channels. The reply is a
very long document, much more
lengthy than the German note. This
point has been one of the matters of
discussion during the conferences, the
question having been raised that it
Is too long and should be short and
sharp. But there were so many points
for elucidation and such a complete
difference of conception of the ob
jects and purposes for which the two
sides went to war that it was found
desirable to extend the note to con
siderable length. The presence here
of Alexandre Ribot, the French fi
nance minister, permitted the French
ministry to be represented during the
conferences.
Unusual optimism is shown here
as'a result of the final form which the
reply has taken, which is believed to
be such that it will meet with sat
isfaction at Washington.
The reply to the American note
will follow in a few days after the
delivery of the reply to Germany.
London, Dec. 29, 12:21 p. m. The
spectator devotes the greater part of
tomorrow's issue to answering Presi
dent Wilson's question as to what are
the peace terms of the entente allies.
Briefly summarized the principal de
mands as outlined by the Spectator
follow:
"The peace terms arc to start from
I the status quo before the war, thus
If? including the evacuation of the whole
M of northern France, Belgium and Lux
fi emburg 'and of all lands taken from
9 Serbia, Rumania, Russia and Monte
negro. "Alsace-Lorraine is to be restored
to France. The Danish portion of
Schleswlg-Holstein is to go to Den
mark and Posen, Polish Prussia and
Austrian Poland are to be added to
the new sub-kingdom of Poland which

"The Slavs of Bosnia, Herzegovina,
Dalmatia, Croatia, etc., are to be cre

"Bohemia to 'be an independent

"The Rumanian section of Transyl-

"The German navy to be handed

nations.
"As a guarantee against future
Avar the allies are to insist upon the
democratization of tho German gov
ernment. "The Kiel canal to bo neutralized

commission including the entente
countries, the United Stntes and otn

French Socialists' Plea.
Paris, Dec. 29. 4:45 a. m.-A resolu
tion has been adopted by the Socialist
B congress calling upon the Svernmont
to pursue a more vigorous policy both
in military and in economic action, so
that the full resources of the country
may be brought into play and the wai
A terminated more speedily.
The resolution is Vld
assertion that the replies of thj cen
A l Powers to President Wilson a note
!3 leave no doubt that the offer of peace
f negotiations was a snare.
II Deputies who met German and oth
H er foreign Socialist delegates at the
I conference in Switzerland supported
Ik motion in favor of resumption of in
ternational relations among Socialists.
This proposal was defeated by a small
majority after a long and heated dis
cussion. Italians Deny Story.
Rome, Dec. 29, via Paris, 4:50 a. m.
The Osservatoro Romano, the offi
cial organ of the Vatican, prints today
an official denial of reports published
abroad that the papal munclo at Vi
enna informed the Vienna press that
the Austrian emperor had requested
him to ask Pope Benedict's interven
tion for peace and that the pope had
given a favorable reply.
Turkey Sends Reply.
Washington, Dec. 29. Turkey's re.
ply to President Wilson's peace note !
was received today at the state de
partment. It substantially Is the same
as Germany's and Austria's.
This was the only development here
today in the peace movement. Offi
cials carefully watched the foreign
press comment and were interested
in the announcement that the reply
of the allies to the original German
proposals was ready.
Until the allies' reply, also, to. Presi
dent Wilson's note no move by this
government is at all likely. Mean
while the announced policy of silence
prevails.
Scandinavians' Joint Note.
London, Dec. 29, 12:05 p. m. The
Scandinavian governments have sent
a joint note to belligerents supporting
the peace note of President Wilson.
A Reuter dispatch, from Copenhagen
says the Danish, Swedish nnd Norwe
gian governments have Instructed
their legations to address to the gov
ernments of the belligerent countries
notes in which the Scandinavian gov
ernments, adhering to the note of Pres
ident Wilson concerning measures to
be adopted for facilitating a durablo
peace, declare they would consider
themselves as falling in their duty to
ward their respective peoples and to
ward humanity as a whole if they did
not express their most profound sym
pathy with every effort which may con
tribute toward putting an end to the
sufferings and losses, moral and mate
rial, which are ever growing in conse
quence of the war.
The three governments in conclu
sion cherish tho hope that the Initia
tive taken by President Wilson will
lead to a result worthy of the generous
spirit which prompted this action.

America Will Have Capital
But Not Enough Labor to !
Employ It.
MUST GET TOGETHER
Would Prefer Transfer of Gold
to Europe Rather Than In
flux by Population.
Columbus, Ohio, Dec. 29. The four
national sociological and economics
societies which have been meeting
here, were holding the final sessions
of their convention today at Ohio
State University where problems like,
ly to arise in this country following
the war in Europo and labor problems
weer being discussed by men of na
tional reputation.
The organizations in session here
are the American Economic Associa
tion, the American Sociological Socie
ty, the American Statistical Associa
tion and the American Society for
Labor Legislation.
"We shall have capital after the
war, but shall not have labor enough
to employ it," George E. Roberts of
the National City Bank of New York
said in speaking before the economic
association regarding the situation of
the United States at the close of the
European war, with special reference
to the gold supply. I
'The labor of Europe and the capital
of America will have to be brought
together. Conditions seem to favor
the transfer of capital in the form of
gold to Europe rather than the remov
al of the population from Europo to
America."
Mr. Roberts criticised the new fed
eral reserve act, saying:
"In their anxiety to decentralize the
banking business the authors of thiB
act neglected to centralize the gold
reserves, which is the most important
requisite of a reserve system. The
result is that while the country's stock
of gold has increased from January
1 to November 1 by approximately
$400,000,000, tho federal reserve bank
of New York, on which the demand
for gold export must inevitably fall,
has gained less than $6,000,000 and all
the federal reserve banks together
have gained less than $132,000,000."
The general monetary situation, the
transfer of gold to the bank reserves
of the United States and other coun
tries and the increased use of paper
money in Europe undoubtedly has, and
will continue to have an influence
for higher prices, Mr. Roberts said.

Washington, Dec. 29. General Car

modification of the protocol covering
withdrawal of American troops from
Mexico, was examined closely today
by Secretary Lane, chairman of the
American members of the Joint com
mission, who has summoned his col

representatives when another session
of the commission is held early next

Although the document has not
been public, it was said General Car
ranza's insistence on the uncondition

is not so strong as formerly, chiefly
because of the new military situation
in northern Mexico. Neither does he
flatly repudiate the protocol already

were the "automatic marriage bill,"
wliich provides that the birth of a

WILSON AGREES
TO BOND ISSUE
Money Needed to'Meet Treas
ury Deficit Which Con
fronts U. S. for 1918.
Washington, Dec. 29. President Wil
son has tentatively agreed with ad
ministration leadors in congress on a
bond Issue to meet part of the treas
ury deficit which confronts the govern
ment for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1918, estimated at about $180,000,
000. With Secretary McAdoo, the pres
ident is work on other plans for rals--Ing
additional revenue.
The outstanding interest bearing
debt of the United States June 30 last
as reported to congress by Secretary
McAdoo amounted to $971,562,590. Ex
clusive of postal savings bonds, one
year treasury notes and conversion
bonds, this is made up of $188,489,900
four per cents, $63,945,460 three per
cents (due in 1918), $636,259,550 two
per cents and $50,000,000 Panama three
per cents similar to those to be issued.
The president has pointed out that
he believes a bond Issue should bo
used to meet temporary and emergency
expenditures. Many of these have been
caused by the Mexican situation.
The treasury already has authority
by previous acts of congress to issue
Panama bonds and about $240,000,000
of these are available. They would
bear three per cent.
Plans for raising the other revenue
are understood to concern the Income
tax, an inheritance tax and special
taxes on internal revenue and imports.

TEUTONS OPEN IMPORTANT j: I
OFFENSIVE ALONG WESTE14 f f
FRONTIER OF MOLDAVIA j j
Austro-Germans Plan to Break Through Moun-
tain Region and Force Russo-Rumanians j; I
Along Barrier Into Interior of Moldavia t.. ji I
The opening of what prove to be an 1
important offensive by tne Teutonic
forces along the Moldavian western
frontier is revealed in the current
Berlin statement. Apparently it Is
the Austro-German purpose to break
through the mountain region here and
force the Russo-Rumanian lines back
along the lower Carpathian barrier
into interior Moldavia.
Several heights w$re captured in
the effort, whffch evidently is made
in conjunction with the northward
thrust of the Teutonic armies from
Wallachla to the east of this line, the
southern flank of which is thus threat
ened. From Wallachia northward Field
Marshal von Mackensen's advance has
been pressed on the west nearly 15
miles north of Rimink Sarat and nev?
progress also hag been made near the
Danube, wher Braila a grain and oil
center, is the next important point in
the line of the Teutonic progress.
Russians in the Field.
The Petrograd statement reveals
that Rumanian troops are again in the
field in northeastern Wallachia and
the indications are that resistance of
a most stubborn sort is being offered
to von Mackensen's thrust towards
the Sereth line, which runs northwest
through central Mpldavia from a point
on the Danube just notfi of Braila.
, The Germans, however, have taken
l,40o more prisoners from the Rus
sians together with three cannon.
In Dobrudja, opposite Braila and
Galatz, the Bulgarian, Turkish and
German forces have closed in further
upon the Mat chin bridgehead, taking
the town of Ratchelu on the Danube,
ten miles across the northwestern
neck of Dobrudja from Machin, and
opposite the Bessarabian shore.
Paris today reports the repulse of
an attack in force by tho Germans
between Hill 304 and Dead Man Hill,
northwest of Verdun, admitting pene
tration of but one French trench south
of the latter eminence. Berlin claims
that German troops transferred from
the Somme front penetrated Into the
second and third French lines, cap
tured more than 200 prisoners and
seven machine guns and repulsed
several counter attacks.
Striking back to the French in the
Verdun region, but on the bank of
the Meuse opposite the scene of the
recent French successes, the Germans
made a strong effori- last night to
penetrate the French lines between
Hill 304 and Dead Man Hill at the
two dominating eminence northwest
of the fortress.
According to PariB, the attack was
broken up, the Germans succeeding
in gaining a footing in only ono
trench, south of Dead Man Hill.
The activities around Verdun have
ben virtually the only breaks in tho
monotony of winter trench warfare
along the Franco-Belgian front. The
battle of the Somme admittedly is in
a state of suspense because of the
bad state of the ground and unfavor
able atmospheric conditions, accord
ing to British authority.
In Rumania, where the real activity
of the war centers, Field Marshal
von Mackonsen Is keeping up his
thrust for the line of tho Sereth, in
Moldavia, driving the Russians before
him in none too good order, the Ger
man reports intimate.
Latest accounts placed the left of
von Mackensen's lne beyond Rimnik 1
Sarat, near the Buzeu-Fokshanl rail- !
way line, while his right apparently 1
is drawing close to Braila, at the i
Danube end of the Trunk line from i
Buzeu.
Braila, important as a granary and J
provisioning depot, itself is meanwhile !
reported under fire from across the J
Danube where the Bulgarians, with j
German and Turkish assistance are '
vigorously assaulting the Matchin
bridgehead. The apparent hope is to
clear Dobrudja completely of Russians j
and effect a permanent junction with
the Teutonic forces in Wallachia at a i
point where tho lower Danube will be i
closed completely to Russia UBes and
the way opened north of the river i
for a possible advance Into Bessarabia, 1
just beyond which lies Odessa. t
The latest peace move has been I
made by Norway, Sweden and Den- a
mark, tho three Scandinavian gov- f
ernments having sent a joint note to
the belligerents supporting the peace t
note of President Wilson. 1
