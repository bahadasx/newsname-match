WILSON NOTE SEEKS
TERMS OF PEACE
Recent Statements of States
men Regarded as Being
too Vague.
Washington. Information as lo
their exact meaning In aeeklng a "Juat
and permanent peace" Is tba whole
purpoee of the not addressed to all
the belligerent by President Wilson.
Tbe Vnlted Stales desires a full, prac
tical and detailed statement from earh
of the government addressed. It was
stated official; y for the administra
tion. Thla government does not know and
feela tbat it haa been given no real
meana of knowing what terms would
be required by each or the belliger
tots to make peace. It regards the
recent speeches of the leading etatee
men in ail countries aa vague and un
defined and sees nothing In them that
would enable a conference to draw up
a treaty.
German Note May Be Only Prelude.
Germany's reply to President Wil
eon'a note la regarded hare aa having
advanced tbe peace movement anoth- ,
er atep, despite tbe fact It disappoints ..
In not meeting hia auggestion for aa
avowal of terma.
Tbe reception Germany'a reply re
ceives among the entente alllea, whose .
statesmen nave publicly declared
against such a program, now becomes
the point npon which a further move
la hinged. Tbe German note probably
is the prelude to a aerie of carefully
considered delicate moves in the great
game of world diplomacy, all possibly
leading to an approach for a real dis
cussion of peace terms on grounds
which all the belligerents feel can .
place them at no disadvantage.
Thla la the official view of Cer- f
many'a reply ao far as It haa been for- ,
mutated.
Lanaing'a Warlike View I Modified.
The critical situation of the TJnited
States and the fact that tbe nation
ha been drawing nearer and nearer
to war, .waa responsible. Secretary..
Lansing officially declared, for the, .
president's move In the cause of
peace.
A few houre after Secretary Lea
aing had lasued a statement explain-,
ing the. presidents action, he waa
called to the white bouse. Exactly
what transpired there has not been
revealed, but Immediately after his re
turn to the state department Mr. Lau
aing issued a second statement, ex
pressing regret for possible misinter
pretation, placed npon hia words and
asserting that the United Statee had
no ' Intention of departing from its
course of -strict neutrality.
Congress Takea Recces.
Congress adjourned for the Christ
mae holidays, to reconvene January 2.
In the three weeks of the session the
house passed five government supply
measures the urgent deficiency, leg
islative, Indian, District of Columbia
and diplomatic and consular appro
priation bills more than ever were
passed before In the brief period pend
ing a holiday recess. .
The senate passed the Immigration
bill, with Its literacy test provision,,
and It now is in conference. The sen
ate also began consideration of the
District of Columbia prohibition bill. .
and fixed January 9 for a vote.
TREATY IS RATIFIED AGAIN :
Danish King and Cabinet. Take Final
Action on laland Sale.
Copenhagen, via London. King
Christian in the cabinet council rati

treaty. The exchange of the ratifica
tion Instruments will take place in
