Greek government ??ouhl only think of
the Interests of Greece. The geograph

it in very direct contact with one of
the two groups of belligerent powers,
makes the application of its policy of
neutrality very dlllh-ult: it is for that
reason that she has been forced to
submit to the occupation by foreign
arms of her Macedonian provinces and
to permit the belligerents to dispose
of her ports;, public buildings and
works of art; that her highways and
railroads have been forcibly occupied,
while bridges and tunnels worth many

WASHINGTON. December 2.?The
close friends of Interior Secretary
Franklin K. Lane refused to accept as
accurate to-day t lie report that he
would resign from the Cabinet at an
early date. It was said in well
informed circles that President Wilson
would probably oifer Mr. Lane the post
of Attorney-General.
Attorney - General Gregory is re-I
ported to have announced that iie will
retire to private life early in Jan
uary. The appointment of Mr. Lane to
fill the vacancy would be directly in
line with an ambition he has fre- i
quently expressed, in private, \iltl- j
mately to become a member of the
United States Supreme Court.
It is- considered not at all improb
able that Francis J. Heney. of Los
Angeles, will be invited to enter the
Cabinet. President Wilson is known
to have a very high regard for Mr.
Honey's ability as a prosecutor. The
friends of the latter In Washington
expect him' to be offered the attorney
generalship. provided Mr. Lane prefers
to remain at the head of the Depart
ment of Interior.
Mr. Heney. with Vance C. McCor
mick and the members of the Na
tional Democratic Campaign Commit

Wilson through the last campaign,

Among Senators being mentioned to
succeed the late Senator Clarke, of

?Some Southern Senators have urged
t'n* selection of a "Western Democrat

triumph at the recent election in that
section. Speculation regarding the ma

view of the defeat of Senator Kern for 1

Senator Walsh is being championed by
Western Democrats.

WASH 1 Ni >T? >N\ December ?After
President Wilson lias concluded his ad
dress before Congress on Tuesday, it
is possible he may deliver a brief
address dealing with the high cost of
living.
The President's plans on the sub
ject are as yet indefinite, but it is '
known that the administration con- '
siders the cost of living a pressing
problem, and that many of the I'resi- i
dent's closest advisers favor consider
ing il in the legislative program.
Thousands of petitions are pouring into
the White House, calling for some
soil of relief from the present era of
higher [trices, many of them detnand
ing| an embargo on food exports.
The course which the President is
understood to favor is rather an ex
tension of present laws to meet al
leged conspiracies for cornering foods
and price-fixing. An extensive Federal
investigation now is being conducted
by United States attorneys in all the
large cities.

NKW YOHK, December 2.?At a
wireless signal Hashed by President
Wilson from the. yacht Mayflower in
the liarbor here the Statue* of Liberty
was bathed in light at 0 o'clock to
night Barthoidi's famous symbol of
American freedom, which for thirty
years lias been a token of welcome t<?
the United States to millions of im
migrants from every land, will be
illuminated every night hereafter from
top to bottom. Funds to Install the
permanent lighting system for the
statue, the gift to the United States
of 4?0.000 citizens of France, were
provided by public .subscription in this
country.
"I liglit This statue." said the Pres
ident. "with the thought that it may
always stand as a symbol of our pur
pose to throw upon liberty, out of our
own life as a nation, a light which
shall reveal its dignity, its serene
power, its benignant hope and spirit
of guidance."
Grouped around the President upon
the Mayflower's deck as he flashed the
signal were Mrs. Wilson. Jules .1. Jus
serand. ambassador of France, and
Madame Jusserand. high ofllcers of the
army and navy and representatives of
several nations.
The great guns of a division of the
Atlantic Fleet anchored in the harbor
as a guard of honor, boomed a salute
as the. statue flashed into view, out
lined in white light. The whlsfles of
countless harbor craft shrieked in
unison and flashes of ted light blazed
up along the New York and New
Jersey shores.

There was a flash of flame high
above the statue, and Buth Law, in
her airplane added a spectacular touch
to t lie ceremonies of illumination.
Spouting sparks and tire from the tail
of her machine, she circled the lower
end of Manhattan Island. A roar of
cheers from the thousands gathered in
Battery Park greeted her as the let
ters. "Liberty." outlined in clcctric
lights, were revealed on the bottom of
the airplane
The course of the Mayflower was
marked by the rays of the most power
ful searchlight in the world as the
yacht's anchor was hoisted and the
presidential party headed for the Bat
tery to disembark for the motor car
parade, which preceded a dinner in
honor of Mr. Wilson and Ambassador
Jusserand.
Leaving the statue behind, the party
on the Mayflower looked out upon a
city of light. New York's "billion
dollar skyline" was literally ablaze.
Klectric lamps gleamed through count
less windows in scores of "sky
scrapers." <'lose behind the Mayflower
streamed the United States ship San
Francisco, with Secretary of the Navy
l>aniels aboard, followed by the United
States ship Youkton, carrying mem
bers of Mayor Mitchel's committee of
200 and other invited guests. From
the Battery electric motor cars carried
the guests uptown.
The parade passed up Fifth Avenue,
which had been cor verted into a
"golden way." Long ribbons of light
gleamed on either side of the thorough
fare as far north as Thirty-third
Street. The President anil his party
there entered the hotel, where the
banquet was held under an electric
lighted canopy of red, white and blue.

The illumination of Liberty was
viewed from points of vantage by many
thousands of New Yorkers. Thou
sands more lined the streets through
which the President passed, and cheered
him lustily.
Mr. Wilson rose frequently and
doffed his hat in acknowledgment of
the salutes.
The illumination of the statue is re
garded by electrical experts as the
climax of development in the art of
flood lighting. For the bronze torch
which Liberty has held aloft was sub
stituted a glass torch held together by
ihe same riveted lines. To put "life"

of the torch. 1 ..*>00 candlepower gas

the light which will illuminate the en

The fluids which provided the light
ing plant were raised by popular sub

which also raised the money thirty

"VI3W VORI\. December 2.?President
Wilson, speaking to-night at the ban
quet which was the culmination of the
celebration in honor of the permanent
Illumination of the Statue of Liberty in
New York harbor, declared that he had
thought for the last two years that
"peace is going to come to the world
only with liberty."
"The peace of the world," Mr. "Wil
son added, "is not going to be secured
by the compacts of nations, but by tho
sympathies of men."
The President declared that the
United States has a community of Ideas
w 1" ranee, whose people presented
BartlioUli'a statue to the United States,
because "one republic must love an
other." .
The President spoke of the signifi
cance of the Statue of Liberty to the
immigrants. Me said he wondered
whether the spirit typified by tho spirit
of the statue Is truly represented here.
The President said he noticed that j
the source of light for the statue
"comes from the outside."

"The only light that w/> can con- !
tribute to the illumination of the world '
is the light that shines out of our
own lives. We must illustrate liberty
in our lives. With all due respect
for those who represent other na
tions not governed as ours, I do not
think that nations ruled by small
groups of men can be. successful."
i lie world, declared the President,
"is enlightened by Ideas and ideals,
anil ihe sacrifices of men enable (he
world to go forward."
< ontliiulng, the President said:
"1 was struck by the closing phrase
"r ^r- Pulitzer's admiralhe little
speech. Me said that there would come
a day when it was perceived that the

come so long as ihe destinies of men

make seltlsh choices of their own.
THINKS or Tllltll.l.s THAT

"When I see tho Statue of Liberty ;

come into some hopeful heart as for

sacrifices, the mutual concessions, the
righteous yielding ,.f )rtsh right that
is -signified by ihe word and the con

"I wonder if we all wish to accord
