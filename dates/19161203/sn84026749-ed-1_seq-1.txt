HIGH COST OFJLLNESS NEXT
"Medical Journal" Advises Physi
cians to Raise Fees for Services.
NEW TORK, Dec. 3. The high cost
of sickness may be added to the list
of woes of those referred to In arti
cles on economics aa the "ultimate
consumer,' 'if doctors take the advice
of the. New York Medical, Journal.
In an editorial In the current Medi
cal Journal a writer suggests that
doctors raise their prices.
"When prices begin to go up," the
editor 'says "popular opinion avers
that wagea will be the last Item to
acquire a soaring tendency. Wages
Indeed are extremely conservative In
such matters, but there Is another
class of payments that la even more
laggard: our readers will quickly
guess that the reference Is to pro
fessional fees. Far from going up.
the average physician ft nil, some of
his fees vanishing altogether ,and al
most alone In .the community he nan
his income decreased both relatively
and absolutely."
THa atairnatlon In fee, accordlnc to
the writer, Is due to the inertia of the
doctors ana tacit oi im worn.
AV believe that thia matter of fees
should be taken up at once. Sched
do
ules should be proposed as society
meetings, and the results should be
made public In order that the laity
may not be taken unawares. One
dollar should become two dollars,
two dollars should become three.
These aremere suggestions. Why
ehould the doctor alorte try to live on
an Income that was not too large two
score years ago and has been virtu
ally oVgrowlng smaller every year

On August IS, 191. a raid was made

POLICE FIND NO HAYS CtUE
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaai)
Search for Man Charged With As
sault. Fruitless So Far.
Detectives are still without a clue
to the whereabouta of Will 8. Hays,
of Cleveland, wanted In connection
with the attempted hold-up of Abram
Llaner, well-known merchant, In a
room at the Raleigh Friday after
noon. Although "look-outs" for Hays have
been sent to all nearby cities, no
trace of the man ha yet been found.
Inspector Grant, chief of detectives,
said today he expected to hear some
thing from Cleveland, the man's
home, that might be of assistance in
the search.
Warrant 8 warn Oat.
A warrant for Hays, charging as
sault with a dangerous weapon, waa
worn out yesterday by detectives
after Mr. Llaner declared a picture of
Hays to be a striking, resemblance
of the man who held him up.
The detectives on the case do not
regard It as remarkable that the man
who attempted to hold up Mr. Llsner
should walk away from the hotel hat
less without being noticed by some
one. Might Escape Netlee.
They point out that Twelfth street
and Pennsylvania avenue Is a busy
corner In the afternoon, and that
well dressed man would hardly at
tract unusual attention merely be
cause he was bareheaded.
In view of the fact that a wig waa
found In the pocket of a coat which
the man left In the room leads the
detectives to believe that he may
have carried a cap in one of the pock
eta of the coat that he wore away.

LONDON, Dec. 3. Dissatisfaction
with the conduct of the war I finding
more ond more violent expression In
widespread demands that the present
coalition government be superseded,
A long conference between Premier
Asqulth and Klng.Oeorge has added
to the belief that some such move Is
Inevitable., '
Prominent among the advocates for
a stronger policy Is Lord Northctlffe,
owner of the London Times and other
English papers, and he-has been susr-

Would Hasten Peace.
Ono authority makes the pertinent
suggestion that In case Asqulth Is
forced out there would be a tendenoy

Undoubtedly It will be sponsor for
a new war council of five, with David
Lloyd-George a the leading spirit.
This new war Cabinet would control
all war measures, both military am'
economic, advised by Gen. 8lr Will
lam R. Robertson, chief of the Inv
perlat staff, and Admiral Sir John R.
Jelllco, first sea lord.

From recent statements In Lord
Northcllffe' London papers, the Times
and the NewS, It Is assumed here that
the famous publisher Is backing the
plan to put Lloyd-George In Asqultli'a
