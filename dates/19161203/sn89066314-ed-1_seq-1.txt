SAYS CITY'S POVERTY
BSE
RIOUS PROBLEM
C E. Major, Secretary of Lo
cal Charity Board, Cites
North Side Conditions.
300 ARE IN POVERTY
Low Wages and Cheap Labor
Unknown to the Pros
perous Section.
-People here think of Columbia as
that section south of Broadway. Only
few know there Is a 'noith of town';
this is especially true of the students
In the University. Being limited to
this point of view, they do not and
cannot realize that Columbia has a big
problem in the extent of poverty and
had living conditions. A knowledge
of the real conditions would surprise
many residents who think they know
their home town, and especially the
students, who confine themselves to
the prosperous south side."
"Wages are low. Columbia is over
stocked. The number of laborers far
exceeds the opportunities for work.
The employers know and take advan
tage of this condition."
. "In the last five years wages in
Columbia have not Increased one pen
ny. The cost of the necessities of
life has gone up 33 1-3 per cent"
"There are about seventy-five poor
white families In this town. They in
clude about 300 persons. The condi
tions under which they live are mis
erable. "If the wage earner is sick for one
week, the whole family Is thrown into
dependency. Tnere are many more
negro families in this condition. The
charity organization makes no dis
crimination. There are about thirty
families entirely or partially depen
dent all the time."
These are some of the observations
made by D. E. Major, secretary of the
Columbia Charity Organization So-
'ctety, after about three years work
among the poor of Columbia.
Mr. Major has two rooms in the
Nowell Building. One room is re
served as an office, with which all the
poor of Columbia are acquainted. He
receives them here every day between
2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon. This
hour is usually a busy one for Mr.
Major. The poor persons come in
steadily with their stories and he
knows every one, questions them with
friendly interest about personal mat
ters, and through this work he knows
every detail that handicaps each par
ticular family.
The other small room Is an "old
clothes" room. The poor are allowed
to come here and choose the necessary
clothing.
A large number of turkey dinners
were sent to the poor this Thanksgiv
ing. During Christmas Mr. Major will
see that they get a similar treat.
Financially the organization is help
ed by the County Court, a will calling
for a few hundred each year, and con
tributions by the people of Columbia.
Contributions by people of Columbia
are made once a year by means of a
campaign carried on by the Finance
Committee of the charity organization.
The campaign this year will begin
Tuesday, December 5. Many Colum
bia men and women have volunteered
to aid in the soliciting of the contri
butions. BEX 3IAGEE TO NEW POSITION

State Sale of Red Cross Seals

This City.

Campaign Is Conducted By
Association for Relief of
Tuberculosis.
Columbia right now is the center of
the biggest health campaign thatiny
state has ever attempted. The post
age alone in this great movement will
cost $4,000, and printing will cost
about the same sum. This campaign,
devoted now to the sale of Red Cross
Christmas seals, is being conducted by
the Missouri Association for the Re
lief and Control of Tuberculosis, with
headquarters at Columbia.
Twenty-five and a half million Red
Cross Christmas seals have been print
ed for sale in this state. Every per
son in Missouri will receive litera
ture on the sale of the seals and edu
cational propaganda on how to pre
vent the spread of tuberculosis.
To Make Missouri First
Dr. Walter McNab Miller, secretary
of the association, is trying hard, to
sell more seals in Missouri in pro
portion to the population than will be
sold in any other state. In 1914
Missouri ranked twentieth among the
states. In 1915 the state ranked tesh.
The secretary is sending out let
ters to every editor, school board
member, moving picture theater,
school principal, school superinten
dent, rural school teacher, physician,
district and county women's organi
zation and commercial club in the
state. Seventy-five persons are em
ployed in the office of the secretary
and will be kept busy until after the
Christmas holidays.
The campaign is being directed to
school children. The students are
anxious to take part ,and friendly ri
valries spring up in efforts to dispose
of the largest number of seals. Six
hundred thousand 4-page circulars, to
go to the school children of the state,
contain a picture of an open-air school
for anemic children and carry the
suggestion that these children will win
against odds if helped by the heaUhy
children.
And 100,000 Blotters.
Four hundred thousand advertising
blotters, containing the pledge of the
"Modern Health Crusade" have been
printed and are being distributed.
This is the pledge, "I will keep my
mind and body clean; keep my body
strong with good plain food, fresh air
and outdoor exercise; let air and
sunlight come freely into the house
where I live and the building in which
I work; buy some Red Cross Christ
mas Seals to help prevent and cure
tuberculosis."
Fifteen thousand pamphlets con
taining suggestions on how to conduct
Red Cross Christmas seal campaigns
are being sent to consignees and
helping organizations. To go with the
suggestions are 15,000 circulars stat
ing that seals are to be had where
the posters are on display.
Situation In The State.
"The Economic Aspect of Tubercu
losis" is the title of a 2-page circular
giving statistics regarding the loss to
the nation and the cost to Missouri
from tuberculosis. Between 75,000
and 80,000 of these leaflets will be
printed for circulation in this state.
The progress toward legislative
benefit for the prevention and control
of tuberculosis is outlined in a hand
bill, of which 30,000 impressions wilj
be made. The present constitution of
Missouri prevents the state from ade
quately equipping and maintaining a
sanatorium large enough for the care
of all incipient cases of tuberculosis.
To The Rural Teachers.
The 10.000 rural teachers of Mis
souri will receive a special word
from the secretary of the association.
This letter will appeal to the rural
school children through the teachers by
offering a reward of "Ritchie's Primer a million dollars yearly and a privi
on Sanitation" as a prize to the l-room,ege tax upon the caPital stock am
rural school in each county which. lue surPius l a" corporations oi me

ed by the World Book Company.
Twenty-five thousand publicity cir
culars, asking people to bring Mis-
souri to first rank among the states
in the number of seals sold, have been
struck. In 1915 but nine states sold
more seals in proportion to the popu
lation. Doctor Miller appeals to Mls
sourians to overcome the lead of these
nine states.
