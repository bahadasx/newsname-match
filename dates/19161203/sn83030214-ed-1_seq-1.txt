LLOYD GEORGE
MAY RESIGN TO
OUST ASQ?ITH
Angry at Slackness, Is
Preparing to Stake
His Future
COUNCIL OF FIVE
TO DIRECT WAR
Premier's Foes Hope to
Control it and Force
Vigorous Policies
By ARTHUR S. DRAPER
London, Dec. 2.--Premier Asquith
ha i a long audience with the King
Following it a myriad ru?
mors spread o-- er I/ondon. chief
| them the report that he had
??' d. that Bonar Law had suc
1 him temporarily, and that
David Lloyd George wculd finally
roe Prime Minister.
Lord Xortiicliffe in "The Evening
News" reportad that Lloyd George
and his secretaries were packing up,
preparatory to quitting UM War
But this "out gingers" the
"ginger group" organ, "Reynolds's
Newspaper."
Lloyd Coorge Dissatisfied
This paper, controlled by Sir
Henry I>a!/iel, a '-'.ose friend of
Lloyd George, will say to-morrow:
Mr. Lloyd George is entirely dis
. d with the present conduct of
the war, culminating in the failuro
adequately to assist- Rumania, and
his resignation is likely at any mo?
ntent. If he resigns it means that
he believes the opposition strong
enough to overthrow Asquith. If he
il wrong in this assumption he will
be eliminate'! politically for some
time."
"Critical" is the only word covering
1 the situation here. Anything milder
fall? short of the truth. Since my dis
patch of November 24 telling of th?
BBOVe to ?helve Asquith the opposition
ha? gained much ground, and now tho
?tage is set for a tremendou? political
battle.
Struggle for Maatery
"Political battle" la really too un?
dignified a term, for this I? really n
struggle between two .orce? holding
different view? a? to the method?
necessary to attain the ?ame end as?
surance of Britain's position ir. trin
world.
Thi' first session of Parliament will
see the initial test of strength. Tha
opposition plan call? for a war council
of five, Including the Premier, Lloyd
George, Bonar Law. A. J. Balfour. Fir?t
Lord of the Admiralty, and Sir Ldwani
Carson. This council would hava su?
preme control. If there were a chanc?
of succeas with another man the op?
position would eliminate Asquith, but
with Carson combining force? with
! Lloyd George and Bonar Law, th?y
think their policies will be carried out.
Vital Queutions to Com? Up
On Tueaday Premier Asquith will
introduce a new vota of credit, and ha
is expected then to deal with several
vital question? awaiting solution. HI?
statement probably will be followad by
a di?cu??ion in which A. J. Balfour,
First Lord of the Admiralty, and
others will particip?t?.
Th?; n?me of the food controller vrill
be announced, while the subject of th*
country's man power and the control
of the air service? will be debatad.
Mr. Balfour'? failure to adopt sugges?
tions made by a committee In regard
to the air service has com? In for th.
sharpest criticism.
The country has reached a point
where promises no longer ?atlsfy. Too
many have gono unfulfilled where de?
lay and procrastination exasp?r?t?
beyond measure, and where fearful re?
sult? must follow unless the strongest
course ir pursued.
Many Cause? of Crlni?
The pre??-nt situation i? due to a;
variety of cause?. Submarine BStil i
tie?, food shortage, Rumania's plight
ami the ever-growing lists of casual?
ties serve to impress the people wits
the immensity of the undertaking they
are pledged to see through.
Determination and confidenca are as
strong as ever, for Britain wanta to
"carry on"; her situation is not un?
common for a belligerent in the mid?t
of war. The present government i?
certair.ly a? easfous to win a? the op?
position, but it? terrible weight of r?
spoiikibility makes for caution.
No one i?ppr?'ciates the internal con
? ditions of Great Britain's allie? ?o
well a? members of th? Cabinet; ro
outsider know? the difficulties which
