NEW YORK. Dec. 2. President i

Bartholdi's famous symbol of
American freedom, which has been
for SO years a token of welcome
to the United States to millions
of Immigrants from every land,
will be illuminated every night
hereafter from top to bottom.
Funds to install the permanent
lighting system for the statue, the
girt tt the United States of 400,
000 citizens of France, were pro
vided by public subscription.
Crouped around the President on
the deck of the yacht Mayflower,

fleshed the signal which turned on the
lights, were Mrs. Wilson, Jules J.

ways stand as a symbol of our purpose
to throw upon liberty. out of our life
as a nation, a light which shall reveal
its dignity, its serene power, its ben
ignant hope and spirit of guidance."
Guns of Fleet Roar.
The great guns of a division of the
Atlantic fleet boomed a salute as the
statue flashed into view, outlined in
white light The whistles of countless
harbor craft shrieked in unison and
flares of red light blazed up along the
New York and New Jersey shores.

There was a flash of flame high
above the statue and Ruth' Law, in

touch to the ceremonies of illumina

the tail of her machine, she circled
the lower end of Manhattan Island. A
roar of cheers from the thousands ,
gathered in Battery Park greeted her
as the letters "L-I-B-E-R-T-Y" outlined
in electric lights were revealed On the
bottom of the aeroplane.

NEW YORK, Dec. 2. President
Wilson, speaking tonight at the
banquet 'which was the culmina
tion of the celebration In honor
of the permanent Illumination of
the Statue of Liberty in New
York harbor declared that he had
thought for the last two years
that "peace is going to come to
the world only with liberty."
"The peace of the world," Mr. Wil
son added, "is not going to be secured
by the compacts of nations, but by the
sympathies of men."
Our Love For France
The President declared that the
United States has a community of
Ideas, with France, whose people pre
sented Ilartholdi's statue -to the Unit

love another." j
The President spoke of the sitrnifi- j

immigrants. He said he wondered j

(By Review Leased . Wire)
JUAREZ, Dec. 2. An efficial
dispatch from Mexico City saying
that General Murguia had defeat
ed Villa troops that tried yester
day block his advance and was
moving on Chihuahua today, re
ceived confirmation here in a re
port by direct line from Sauz to
. the effect that Murguia and Tre
' vino had already joined forces
and were attacking the city on the
south side today.
General Murguia and his division
had puzzled the Carranza authorities
here for some days, and even started
a rumor tliHt he had withdrawn to
Torreon. It is now officially said
that his slow progress north from his
base at Kscalon about lSii miles south
of Chihuahua, was due to the effective
wrecking of the Mexican. Central
tracks by Villa.
General Ozuna is reported to be
stationed to the north of Chihuahua
City with a strong government force.
Evacuation Expected
No details of the fighting have ben
received, however, but a high officer
here said he would not be surprised
to get news at any time that Villa had
evacuated. As trains, supposed to be
filled with loot, were seen leaving
Chihuahua west over the line of the
Mexico Northwestern several
days
ago, he said he assumed that Villa
would take that direction.
No Villa bands have been reported
north of Sauz, which is 25 miles north
from Chihuahua City.

the dispatches indicated that the ban

their admissions that the renewed
strength of Villa may prove an em-

ficulty in doing so. It is assumed
that Villa's supply of ammunition
must have been materially reduced by
logical and in line with Villa's tactics
that he will evacuate Chihuahua after

supplies as he can secure. The de-
partment reports indicate that a con
siderable portion or Trevino's force

tle. Banditry Elsewhere
Villa's success in the north has
prompted officials to study with more
anxiety movements in other parts of
the country. The operations of Gen
eral Felix Diaz In south Mexico have
brought out the fact that he and his
agents have made earnest efforts to
obtain the cooperation of Villa and
other bandit leaders in his campaign
against the defacto government.
