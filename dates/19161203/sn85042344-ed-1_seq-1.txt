Convention, Marked by Lack
of Politics, Adjourned;
Plan Reorganization.
Special to The World.
OKI-UHOJIA CITY, Dec. 2. That
an appropriation of $5uu be inado
from the. association's funds und us
much more as may be secured from
any other sources bo used In a enin
paign for mine liberal salaries for
school teachers; that In view of the
high cost of living the president of
the fulled .States be uppeulud to lay
an embargo on tho shipments of food
stuffs to foretell countries; that
teachers In Oklahoma favor extension
oi equal suffrage to nil nualifed elec
tors of the state, whatever sex. were
principal features of the resolutions
idopted by tho Oklahoma Kducution
ul association, which closed its an
nual convention this nftcrnoon.
I'p to Legislature.
The legislature, according to an
other resolution, will bo asked to ap
propriate $100, UOU for electing of a
building at tho state university for
use of tho school of education. The
association is to be reorganized on
the lines of tho California association
and It Is urged In a resolution that a
student loan fund be established from
the state school fund in which worthy
persons wishing to go thru collet
may borrow funds from the state at
a" low rale of Interest. The county
unit system was also endorsed.
Make Less Tliun llodcnrrler.s.
A report having to do with tho
matter of salaries and pensions for
teachers, read by Superintendent
.Monroe of the Muskogee schools,
showed that tho average rural teach
ers made much less during the year
than a hoilcarrter, that the averugo
carpenter had much more with which
to meet the high cost of living than
tho principal of a high school. It
was pointed "ut that many states
have already Instituted tho pension
system fur teachers of old age or who
are Infirm.
CaiiilMiiKii t Once.
Tho campaign to Incrcuse salaries
and for pensions will probably be
started at onco and it is possible tho
coming legislature will bo confronted
with the problem that affect the
teacher, In which relief will be asked.
In the reorganisation plan pro
posed, the officers of the .association
with four others to be named by the
president will compose an advisory
committee and this committee is au
thorized to meet with the superin
tendents' division of tho national edu
cational association in Kansas City
the last week In February.
Five From Politic.
Those who have been members of
the association many years say the
convention closed today wu mora
free from politics, either partisan or
school, than any meeting yet held.
This Is the condition the association
has been striving for during the past
few years.
The fact that a woman was for the
first time elected at the heud of tho
association and whoso name had not
even been mentioned In the list of
possible candidates Indicated, In the
opinion of some members, that tho
association not only wanted to got as
far away from political environment,
but that the woman suffrage propo
sition had come to stay and they
might as well recognize It now.

and even started a rumor that ho was

It is now said officially that his

Allho the Ituiiianians a ppai wit ly are

Still another enemy force Is report
ed to have brokn thru and defeated
the first Rumanian army southwest
of l'iteshtl. enabling it to capture
general 'staff olflcets. The Ruman
ian and Russian communications are
t-ilciit regarding this last claim, altho
both admit that the Rumanians un
der pressure were compelled to re
treat slightly In this sector. Further
west in Wallacbia, the Rumanians
assert that adverse weather condi
tions are hampering their operations.
Russian Aid Too Lale.
It. is generally believed here that
llusian pressure on von Falkonhuyn's
army thru Transylvania, has come too
I late to offset the rapid gains of the
'German or affect materially the Ger
! man plans of encircling liiicharest.
I The Russians' latest sui s in cap-
tilling a series of heights soutbe of

; wedge Into Transly vania and proves a
! most encouraging counter move on
the part of the allies.
Success for -Miles.
That the Russian forces In con
junction with Rumanians are making
progress in Dobriulja is indicated by
the latest communication which re
ports that tho allies have regained
part of tho Tchertiavoda bridge, ocm
pelllng the opposing forces to retiro
southward from several heights. A
-tfli-nlf Icmit feature of the move from
all polius in this leater of war Is the
absenco of claims that either side Is
taking large numbers of prsoners
which seems to Indicate the desperalo
character of the encounters.
VILLA SUCCESS IS

Protocol Not Being
Ratified by Carranza.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 2. While
I hey wait for General Carranza to n
cept or rcj ct the protocol signed bv
the Joint ciiminl.sslcn at Atlantic City,
udminisiralion officials are giving
much attention to every report relat
ing to tho activities of Villa and t
rebel movements in other parts ol
Mexico.
Additional information reaching tho
slute und war departments todav
tended to confirm the story of Villa's
capture of Chihuahua city us rcl-ited
by refugees at the bonier, but no'ie ot
'lie dispatches indicated that the ban
dit leader was moving northward io
iiltack Juarez.
Officials are (rank in their ndnils
nletis that the telle wed strength of
Villa limy prove an embarrassing fac
tor In view of the probable resumption
of conferences l v the Joint commis
sion that drafted the protocol pro
viding for conditional withdrawal of
General Pershing's iroops. It is real
ized l hut a success'iil attack on Gen
ual Murguia now advancing from the
south might lead tu uncontested Villa
control of the city of Chihuahua and
other towns i f the state, and present
a most eml urrassii.g situation for D o
L'nlte.i States
Villa's success in the north has
prompted officials to study with more
anxiety reports of revolutionary move
ments in other parts of the coi:r"y.
The operations of Gen. Felix Diaz Ir
the extreme south of Mexico have
been extended somewhat and informa
tion has reached here that ho and his
agents have made earnest efforts to
I secure tho co-operation of tho ilia
ami other independent leaders.

There was flash of flame high above
the statue and Ruth Law In her air

ceremonies of Illumination. Spouting
fires ami sparks from her machine,
she circles to the lower end of Man
