New Reports of Bandit Raids
and Rumored Defection of
Gen. Trevino Likely to
Postpone Dealings.
REVOKE ORDER FOR
SHIPS TO REMOVE
Pancho Villa's Outlaw Hordes
Said to be on Way to Chi
huahua to Enthrone
Their Leader.
Intprmtl'Tinl Ntvs Sorvi-e;
WASHINGTON. July 17. Post
ponement of the pending "direct
negotiations" between the I'nited
States tnd the le fat to government
of Mexl'-o today appeared almost in
evitable. Officials admitted that if
the unofficial reports of the increas
ing bandit activities along and near
tiie border are confirmed, it -would
be impossible to discuss the with
drawal of American troops at this
time.
Another reason given for the sug
gested postponement is the reported
defection of Gen. Trevino. He is in
command of the main Carranzista
army in northern Mexico. Denials
from the .Mexican embassy have met
every suggestion that this leader has
revolted against the Carranza rule.
Humors persist here, however, that
Trevino has renounced Carranza, and
these reports have reached the war
and state departments. Verifica
tion of them will make it almost
pertain that the preliminary arrange
ments "for the proposed direct nego
tiations will be dropped, at least
temporarily.
pending further developments the
navy department has suspended its
policy of gradual withdrawal of
American ships from Mexican wa
ters. A few, of the destroyers and
fast cruisers assigned to Mexican
duty already have been withdrawn,
but" the others will remain at their
posts in Mexican waters, or in readi
ness to steam there at short notice,
until the situation in northern Mex
ico is definitely known through of
ficial reports.

Kaiser Gets Facts
On Somme Battle
In Trip to Front
1 nternn tieiial News Service:
AMSTERDAM, July IT. Emperor
William is at the Somme front, ac
cording to a dispatch received today
from Herlin. It stated that official
announcement had been made in the
German capital to the effect that
the kaiser spent all day Sunday in
th'e fifrhtinu area listening to reports
of the German Commander-in-Chief
on the operations against the French
and British armies.
On his way to the front the kaiser
held a lon interview with Gen. von
Falkenhayr, chief of the German
general staff.
Cpon reaching the Cerman lines
the war lord visited military hos
pitals where he pinned the iron cross
upon a number of the wounded, at
the same time expressing thanks and
esteem for the men who had fought
so gallantly for the fatherland.
Of the seven generals in the Prus
sian army who have been relieved of
their commands and pensioned, it
is reported that most of them are
stationed on the western front. This
was the first great shake-up in the
command of the Prussian army, and
indicates that the kaiser has begun
to feel home anxiety over the out
come of the fighting in France.

Senate Faces Problem of
Meeting Commercial Pacts
Of European Powers
International News Service:
WASHINGTON, July 17. The
senate this week will have before it
the three-cornered problem of deal
ing xvith the commercial alliances
now being formed .by the belligerent
sations to. regain the economic posi
tions they have lost during-the war.
These alliances are:
1. The entente. -composed of
Great Pttain. France, Uussia, Italy,
Japan, Portugal.' Servia and Bel
gium, having for its object the boy
cotting of Teutonic goods after the
war.
2. The central Kuropean alliance,
composed of Germany, Austria, Tur
key and Bulgaria, designed to ad
xance its trade interests to the ex
clusion of entente goods.
3. The Russian - Japanese alli
ance, military and commercial, in
tended to maintain Russian and Jap
anese interests in the orient and
planned, according to the same auth
orities to close the "open door" in
China.
There is no longer any doubt in
the minds of senators that neutral
interests, particularly American, will
be seriously affected by all these
pac's.
Strong pressure is to be brought
to bear to have the state depart
ment insist that the I'nited States
ge consulted in treaties affecting in
ternational commerce, industry and
transportation. The foreign rela
tions committee has before it a
translation of the recommendations
of the recent Paris enconopiic con
ference advising boycotting Teutonic
poods during and after the xvar.
According to the latest advices from
abroad, these recommendations have

DRY NATION BY 1940
IS PARTY'S SLOGAN
Fromer Governor Hanly to
Indiana is Mentioned as
Candidate Along With
Ford and Foss.
International News Service:
ST. PAUL, Minn., July 17. Har
mony in the party a dry nation by
1910, a presidential ticket that will
command the support of disgruntled
progressives, republicans and demo
crats. These, brefly, were the outstand
ing aspirations today of prohibition
ists from all over the United Stated
a- they began pouring into St. Paul
for the national convention which
opens on Wednesday.
There is no end of presidential
candidates. With few exceptions
every state organization has a man
xvhom it believes can draw the sup
port of the peevish children of
democracy and republicanism. Sim
mered down, however, three names
were star ding out today from which,
according: to their friends, the selec
tion xvill be made. They were:
William Sulzer, former governor
of New York.
Frank Hanly, former governor of
Indiana.
Eugene E. Foss, former governor
of Massachusetts.
The candidacy of Henry Ford has
been largely confined so far to spec
ulation and conjecture. The mil
lionaire pacifist has taken a leaf
from the book of Charles Evans
Hughes and so far has not said he
xvould be a candidate. Neither has
he made a fiatfooted assertion that
he will not. Proponents of the Ford
boom are pointing out that he would
command almost to a man the labor
vote and the pacifist support of all
parties a factor not to be sneezed
at.
?o far there has been no actual
attempt to get a line on the state
delegations to see how they stand
on the presidential question. Read
ers declare they have no definite
knowledge on the matter except that
"some good, strong man will be se
letced." The Sulzer boom may be consid
ered --probably the strongest of the
bunch. It has the undivided sup
port of Eugene W. Chafin. who was
the party candidate in 1508 and
again in 1 SO 2.
Chafin has a large personal fol
lowing in the party, which, it is said,
he can deliver to any one he wants.
"Mr. Sulzer xvill be the candidate."
said Mr. Chafin today. "He is the
strongest candidate we can select."
The radical xving of the party is
advocating a fusion with the father
less progressives under a new party
name American national or liberal.
This, 'however, is frowned on by th
more conservatixe element, of which
Mr. Chafin is the head. He was
strong in the assertion today that
there would be no fusion, and that
the party name xvould remain un
changed. It xvas learned today that though
there has been some extensive cor
respondence on the matter between
the fusion laders and Col. John M.
Parker, the stepfather of the moos.
Col. Parker's name has even been
suggested ns one of the prohibition
candidates. Rut there was little ev
idence of support of such a move
among th? early birds who were on
the grounj today.

WASHINGTON. July 17. A flood
of complaints of the conditions un
der which the mibtiamen called out
for Mexican service arc working lias
deluged members t.f congress. Tho
agitation threatens to precipitate
another scandal similar to that of
the "embalmed beef" scandal of
Spanish-American war days.
Every mail brings letters com
plaining of the quality of food, shel
ter and equipment furnished the
citizen soldiery. Many members of
congress have sought to secure in
formation as to thevf. complaints by
informal application to the war de
partment. Unless satisfactory ex
planations are soon forthcoming
various members threaten to force
an ivestigation by a congressional
committee. Some of the complaints
declare that the men on the border
are eating meat that xvas put in t)v
tins 10 or 15 years ago. Others as
sert that meat has been issued in
tins that haxe been in storage so
long that they have rusted to pier.s.

This act is expected to result in
