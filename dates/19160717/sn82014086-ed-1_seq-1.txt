The heavy fig-Ming? that has been I

t lie Summi' has dwindled perceptibly
! in intensity, Sunday witnessing mere-
,: y heavy bombardments on the British
front and comparative calm on the

northwest of the fortress have cap
tured German positions and south

Vienna Says Russians Repulsed.
In the eastern tVater in the re
' gion of Lutsk heavy lighting has cora-
menced again with tiie Russians the
. aggressors. According to Vienna all
attacks have been repulsed. Neither
the Vienna nor Petrograd official
communica'ion touches upon the op
erations in the Carpathians region,
. but Perograd records the capture from
the Turks by the Russians of the im
portant town of Kaiburt, in Turkish
Armenia, sixty -miles south of the
.Black Sea port of Trebisond.
Italians Making Progress.
The Italians are .still making head
way against the Austrian, accord
ing to Rome, especially on the Posina
line and have repulsed violent counter-attacks
with heavy losses to the
Austrian s.
To the south of the Somme the
Germans .Saturday rig'ht in strong at
tacks launched under the cover of
f"y captured i-a .Maisrmette and the
vi. a-:e of l'.:;e hes, while farther south
they penetrated tirst line French
trml;i. I- rem ail these places they
were driven out later by the French
in heavy counter-attacks. In the
Champagne region there is again grt-u
activity by the French trops, who are
being ai led in their manoeuvres by
iho Russians who recently came to
France.
Four British Attacks Driven Back.
Berlin tells of the repulse of four
British attakes Saturday afternoon in
the region of Ovillers and 1'azentin-le-Petit,
while the .London war office
admits the withduawal to the Britifh
main line of a force that has been
thrown forward to the Foureaux
Woods and was engaged in improving
the new British positions.
German Submarines Active.
Five British patrol tur.vlers and
five British steamers are reported to
have been sunk by German submar
ines. UNDER BLANKET CF FOG
GERMANS HURL ATTACK
Surprise French at Biaches, But
Driven Out by Counter-attack.
Paris, July 16, 2:4.", p. m. Under a
blanket of fog last night, says the
French ofh'c'a! statement issued this
afternoon, the Germans in the region
south of the Somme hurled violent at
tacks against La Maisonette and the
village of Biaches, recently raptured
by the French and took tlfose" posi
tions by surprise. The French, how
ever, immediately launched a vigor
ous counter-attack and recaptured
both places. Xorth of Chilly the Ger
mans penetrated the first line trench
es of the French but later were eject
ed. Near Gulches, north of the river
Aisne, the French stormed the Ger
man trenCb.es and northwest of Ver
dun they made considerable progress
to the west and south of Floury.
TWO THOUSAND DEAD
IN SMALL TRONES WOOD
To the Victors Belongs the Task of
Burying the Fallen.
British Front in France. July 16, 7
p. m., via London. July 17, 1.30 a. m.
Through a sultry Sunday the British
after withdrawing from High Wood,
continued to consolidate their new po
sitions, while the Germans were equal
ly busy in digging in opposite them
and the artillery on both sides was ac
tive. Water, food and ammunition must
be carried forward over the shell- pit
ted area of the ground recently gain
ed. Soldiers who have this task in
, task in hand are seen in the rear
with the supplies and then by some
magic disappear into the earth or
under cover and reappear where ma
chine sun rattles against machine gun
and perspiring soldiers, their throats
parched with dust, are digging and
fighting-.
Still another task, grisly and ardu
ous, falls to the victors; it is burying
the dead. Officers estimate that
there are . 2,000 dead in the small
Trones Wood lone, -while They are
thick In the line of trenches taken
on Friday, and the Delvllle Wood and
fields beyond, up to the new British
lino. A staff officer, speaking of the
results of the allied offensive so far,
said:
"While In the -German offensive at
Verdun the waves of attack always
receded, leaving a large part of the
positions gained in the hands of the
French, when they did no,t altogether
fail, we have been able In tooth our
main attacks to hold practically every
point taken. This requires very care

strict limits . on the, objective of the

BRITISH ADVANCE
BY OPEN FIGHTING
Germans Ordered to Stand to Last
Man and Bayonets Are Used.
British Front in France, July 15, 10
p. m., via London, July 16. -Continuing
their offensive, the British who
yesterday broke through the German
second line of defence now have taken
all of Delville Wood, which was storm
ed by the South Africans, and the
High wood establishments themselves
beyond Bazentin-le-Potit, advanced
parties having been to the outskirts
of Martirjpuich, Ponzieres and some
other points close to the third Ger
man line of defense. The weather re
mains dry and warm.
Machine Guns on Favorable Ground.
The operations after yesterday's ad
vance were more in the nature of
open fighting, the Germans using
strong points on favorable ground
which were good machine positions to
gain time in rallying reinforcements,
digging new trenches, while the Brit
ish dig in opposite them with each
stage of the advance. Frequently they
are so near each other that neither
side dares use its guns. Every possi
ble protection is seized and stoutly
held by both sides.
Hand to Hand in Wood Fight3.
Possession of stretches of woodland
becomes as important as that of vil
lages. The German defenders of
Trones Wood had orders to stand to
the last man and the orders virtually
were obeyed. Cases have been nu
merous in the woods fighting where
Briton and German have been pierced
by each other'es bayonet. It is amaz
ing that in the thick of the struggle
at all points stretcher bearers man
age to bring out the wounded.
Fresh German Artillery.
The Germans are keeping up a
heavy volume of artillery fire in an
swer to the Britih, indicating the ar
rival of fresh artillery. British guns
were able today to reach the main
road of Martin Puich which was
crowded with transports, aeroplanes
reporting immense destruction and
confusion.
British Aeroplanes Fly Low.
Kveryone coming from the front re
marks upon the paucity of German
aeroplanes and anti-aircraft guns de
spite ihe reinforcements in other arms.
British airmen in many instances have
descended as low as ?00 or 500 feet,
tiring upon German infantry with their
machine guns and receiving the cheers
of British infantry. Such low flights
have resulted in remarkably intimate
scouting. ,
Action Beyond Second Line.
The scene of action ha,s been carried
for the first time beyond the second
main line of German defences since
stationary warfare began on the west
ern front, officers returning from the
front line speak of seeing abandoned
German guns, but say they are too
busy fighting to bother to bring them
in.
Grinding Conflict at Close Quarters
The most dramatic situation in the
bottie comes when German gunners
strive to draw off their guns with
British infantry within rifle range. In
the grinding conflict which is cour
ageously forced to close quarters nei
ther the ground taken nor the number
of prisoners is expressive of the re
sults or the stake for which both
sides are fighting.
Advance Greater Than Expected.
British commanders merely say that
they have advanced farther than they
expected and repeat the proceeding
through various stages in the long
and immense undertaking.
Own Gunfire Destroys German Battal
ion. Among the documents captured is
the complaint of a division comman
der of the destruction of a German
battalion by their own gunfire. One
prisoner taken complained that the
only persons in Germany who really
had enough to eat were the British
prisoners, thanks to parcels sent them
from home and American interest in
their welfare. Generally they com
plain more of the British artillery fire
than of the food shortage. They think
that Germany is in no danger of
starving and that the war will be de
cided by fighting like that of the last
two weeks where every gun, rifle, man,
trench or gully or tree which gives
cover will count.
It Is difficult for anyone not at the
front to realize the change, in the new
army wrought by those two weeks,
thanks to the first continued offensive
which is giving the troops practical
lessons day by day.

In Volhynfa Germans Retreat.
Petrograd, July lfi, via London, July
17, 2:10 a. m. In Volhynia the Rus
sians in the region of Ostroff and
Goubine have put down heavy Teu
tonic attacks launched in mass for
mation, and forced the Teutons to re
treat to avoid the danger of being
outflanked, according to the Russian
official communication issued this eve
ning. Upwards of three thousand men
were captured in the fighting.
NEW BATTLE CRUISERS
OUR FIRST NEED
They Come Before Dreadnoughts, in
' Rear Admiral Knight's Opinion.
Washington, July 16. In response to
a request by Secretary Daniels for an
opinion on what lessons might be
drawn for the naval "expansion pro
gramme from the Jutland battle be
tween the British and German fleets.
Rear Admiral Knight of the naval war
college has replied that far from dis
crediting the battle cruiser, although
vessels of that typ:. bore the brunt of
the losses in the engagement, the
fight added a new area to the field of
usefulness of the fast fighters,
gramweetaohsy ton wi sthe time ' for
Battle Cruisers First.
The battle has not changed the ad
miral's opinion that dreadnoughts aie,
and will continue to be, the backbone
of any fighting fleet, but it has caused
him to recommend that if congress
decides to add only four capital shi:
to the first uue a.i Kiiouid be battle
cruisers.
Changes in Naval Recommendations.
The admiral expressed the belief
that the battleship would continue to
be the backbone of every efficient
fighting fleet, but added that develop
ments in battleship design had been
so rapid that he was glad of an op
portunity to make a change in recom
mendations for naval building made
by him some months ago, the change
being that
"If the number of capital ships to be
provided for this year is four, I re
commend that all be battle cruisers.
"If the number is six, I recommend
four battle cruisers and two dread
noughts. "If the number is ten I recommend
six battle cruisers and four dread
noughts." United States Navy's Need.
He pointed out the difference be
tween operations on the comparatively
small Xorth Sea and those under
which the United States navy would
have to operate over a much larger
marine area against an enemy be
yond the seas. He said that one re
spect in which the navy as it exists
today is hampered or would be hamp
ered, in the even of war, is that it has
no battle cruisers and no scout cruis
ers. In other words, we have no
means of gaining information as to
the location or the movement of an
enemy force or of denying to the en
emy information as to our location or
movements. Our fleet if it were sent
to sea tomorrow to defend our At
lantic coast from Fast port. Maine, to
the Panama Canal, would iio out with
the commander-in-chief and every
body under his command pra cticu.ll v
blindfolded. I am sure you all krnow
that the very first thing that the
commander of an army or a. fleet
needs is information of the enemy, its
where abouts, its movements, the'eon
stitution of its force, and ,f possible,
information as to its plans.
High Speed With Great Gun Power.
The letter sums up the value of the
battle cruised as follows:
"They are ideal, first, because their
very high speed enables them to
search out an enemy force and get in
formation back with regard to" that
force and second, because if they meet
an enemy force they have great pow
er of resistance, if the force is one
which they can properly resist and
great power of avoidance if the force
which they meet is one which tails
for avoidance. The characteristic of a
battle cruiser is that it has very hiffh
speed associated with verv eroat gun
power ar.d especially very long range
gun power."
NAVAIi COLLIER HECTOR
-P3 Y00 SALVAGE.
But Only One Member of Crew Re
ported Lost.
Washington. July 16. Captain
Bryan, commandant of the Charles
ton. S. -C. navy yard, advised the navv
department today that he was making
an investigation of the possibility- of
salvaging the U. S. collier Hector,
wrecked in a storm on the Xorth Car
olina coast Friday. A tug has been
sent to examine the Hector. Navy of
ficers here have little hope of saving
the vessel.
The department has not received
confirmation of a report that one of
those aboard the Hector was drown
ed. One hundred and two marines and
saailors from the naval collier wrere
landed Saturday morning by the light
house tender Cypress. Captain New
ell and sixteen men remained aboard
the Hector, which is lying aground off
Charleston Lightship, broken in two.
The chief engineer's skull was frac
tured, and three others of the crew
were badly injured.
The Hector, commanded by Cptnin
Joseoh Newell, had sailed from Port
Royal, S. C, Naval Training Station,
carrying sixtj marines to Santo Do
mingo when she was partly disabled
in Friday's hurricane. She grounded
while trying to make Charleston har
bor, convoyed b ythe steamer Alamo.
High seas had prevented the Alamo
getting close enough to take off the
men, who took to their small boats.
In addition to her commander and the
marines, the Hector, which displaced
11,200 tons, e.arried a crew of sixty
one officers and men.
SHARKS SCARE
SUNDAY SWIMMERS
Coney's Surf Lacked 50,000 Bathers
From Fear of Man-Easters.
New York, July 16.-A1 though two
scharks, each weighing more than 250
pounds, were caught off Staten Island
today and fishermen returning from
nearby Banks reported having seen
several schools of the monster fish
which have been terrorizing bathers,
thousands of New Yorkers crowded to
the various beach resorts as usual.
In many instances proprietors of
bathing pavilions took extra precau
tions by stretching wire, netting nut
beyond the breakers in front of their
places. However, there was a notice
able decrease in the number of persons
who ventured in the water. At Coney
alone, it was said, at least 50,000 re
mained away from the surf for fear of
Sharks.

Forty Hours Battle
in Open Boats
CREW OF RAMOS HAD GIVEN UP
HOPE WHEN RESCUE CAME.
SANK AFTER HURRICANE
Last Man of Crew Put Off Ten Min
utes Before Vessel Went Down
Two Men Lost and Captain and
Others Missing.
Philadelphia, July 16. Stories of
privation, a forty hours' battle in open
boats against gales and mountainous
waves, the loss of two of their nui -ber
and finally when all hands haa
almost given up hope, rescue by the
United Fruit company's steamer Jose,
were brought here tonjght by 1'4
members of the crew of the freighter
Ramos, which sank last Wednesday,
310 miles northwest of Watling Isl
and. The steward and one sailor of the
Ramos were drowned while leaving
the ship. Fears are expressed for the
safety of Captain McGoldrick and
eight other members of his crew who
put off in a small boat but who could
not be found by the Jose. It is pos
sible, however, tlTey may have been
picked up by some other ship.
The Jose, bound from Santa Marta
for Philadelphia, rescued the 14 men
on Friday night off the North Caro
lina coast.
The Ramos with a cargo of bitumi
nous coal, sailed from Philadelphia on
July 9 for Cartagena, Colomoia. Two
days later she rar into the tropical
storm that raged off the South Atlan
tic .coast last week. She sprank a
leak and went down in a few hours,
the last man leaving her ten minutes
before site sank.
PREFERENCE DEMANDED
FOR UNION WORKERS
Until That Is Granted 60,000 New
York Garment Makers Will Stay
Out.
New York, July 16. Until union
workers are shown preference over
others by the manufacturers, the
strike and lockout in the garment in
dustry here, which have affected ap
proximately CO, 000 persons and have
been in progress about three months,
will continue, according to a state
ment made tonight by Samuel Gom
pers, president of the American Fed
eration of Labor, who is presiding ov
er a conference between repr'esenta
livrs of the union and tl'j manufac
turers. "Ths union," declared Mr. Gom
its, ''will naver make any settle
ment which does nut provide, for the
union men The manufacturers may
be able to starve the workers, so that
they might go back temporarily, but
that wmld not be a settlement and
they would only strike again for their
rights when the proper moment ar
rived." .Mr. Gompers added that "the time
lias not cume when they can be
forced back to work."
The strik-?, which virtually has tied
up the industry here, was precipitated
when SiMOu union workers were lock
ed out by the manufacturers. An
additional 80,00 workers struck
through sympathy. Chief among their
uemar.ds were better working condi
tions and recognition of the union..
The manufacturers virtually 'have
agreed to all demands except that
providing for preferential union shops.

Prompt Action on
National Defense
BIG BUILDING PROGRAM FOR
NAVY TO BE SPEEDILY SETTLED
ADJOURN AUGUST 20
Early Date Has Been Resolved on by
Senate Democrats Army Bill, Car
rying $320,000,000, Will Also be
Ready for -Conference -This Week.
Washington, July 16. Senate demo
crats, having resolved on an adjourn
ment of congress by Aug. 20, if possi
ble, work of speeding up the urgent
legislative program outlined by the
party caucus last night will begin in
earnest tomorrow.
When debate on the naval appro
priation bill is resumed, democratic
leaders will seek to hold republicans
to their pledge of co-operation and
will urge their colleagues to limit de
bate. The. big building program prob
ably will be disposed of in two or
three days.
Following the naval bill comes the
army appropriation measure, carrying
approximately $320,000,000. Leaders
now estimate tha both of these na
tional defense bills can be sent to
conference by the end of the week.
The senate then will be ready to take
up the shipping bill, which promises
to develop the only serious opposition
confronting any of the legislation on
the administration's imperative pro
gram. "If we adhere to the action of last
night's democratic caucus," sayl Ma
jority Leader Kern today. "I can see
no reason why adjournment cannot be
taken by August 19."
The democratic steering committee
will mee . early this week and prob
ably will agree upon a program, in
cluding consideration of the following
measures in the order named: Appro
priations, shipping, revenue, work
men's compensation, corrupt practices,
Philippine self-government, Civil war
and Spanish war pensions and Inter
state Commerce Commission enlarge
ment bills. All of these have passed
the house.
The federal workmen's compensa
tion bill, it was reported today, is to
be given precedence over child labor
and immigration bills because of the
keen interest President Wilson has
exhibited in it. In fact, last night's
caucus was informed that tbje presi
dent had urgently requested its pass
age before adjournment.
While the senate is finishing its pro
gram, the house will remain in prac
tical inaction. Beginning Tuesday, no
legislation of disputed character will
:be taken up at all and if conference
reports containing controversial points
are to be acted upon, sufficient notice
will be given absentees. Hundreds of
representatives are leaving the capi
tal. RUSSO-JAPANESE AGREEMENT
LEAVES CHINA OPEN
Only an Arrangement to Combat Ger
man Plots and Influence.
Newport. Ti. I., July 16. An author
ized representative of the Russian gov
ernment now here and speaking for
Emperor Nicholas, explained to The
Asossoiatcd Press today the real rea
son for the recent arrangement affect
ed between Russian and Japan. He
said :
"In view of certain misconstruc
tions and misapprehensions that seem
to have arisen in this country con
cerning the meaning and possible con
sequences of the agreement between
Russia and Japan, it may be useful to
explain that the Russian government,
in concluding the agreement, clearly
made it understood that they had in
view only a joint political action in
China for the special purpose of pro
tecting that country as well as Russian
and Japanese interests there against
German plots and intrigues and the
undue development of German influ
ence so that the principles of the
open door in China is in no way in
fringed or impaired by it."
This follows the lines of a recent
statement to The Associated Press by
Viscount Ishii, the Japanese minister
at Tokio
$340 A YEAR
FOR STREET CLEANERS
New York Employes Can't Satisfac
torily Live on Less, Bureau Finds.
New York, July 16. a standard of
pay for New York's army of municipal
employes is proposed in an exhaustive
report of the bureau oi standards,
made public today. It ranges from
a minimum of 5S40 for unskilled work
ers to $l.r,000 a year for commission
ers. "Our conclusions are," says the re
port, "that below $840 a year an un
skilled laborer's family of five per
sons cannot maintain a standard of
living, consistent with American ideals
and no rate below SS40 has been rec
ommended for the rank and, file of the
street cleaning department and for
unskilled manual workers."
