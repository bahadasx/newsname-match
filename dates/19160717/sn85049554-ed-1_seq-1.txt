or 800 feet, firing upon German in

n/short address:
can. not go thru the simple cere
mony of signing this bill without ex
pressing the feeling that I have in
signing it." said the President. "It is a
feeling of profound Satisfaction, not
only real gratitude that we have com-
Jhls legislation which I hope will
be beneficial to' the farmers.
"The farmers it seems to me, occu
pied hitherto a singular place of dis
advantage. They have not had the
same freedom to get credit on their
real estate that others have had'who
were in manufacturing and commercial
enterprises, and while they have lived
our lives they did not in the same de
gree with some others share in the
benefits of that life.
'Therefore, this bill, along with the
•ery liberal provisions of the federal
reserve act, puts them on an equality
with all otheni who have geniilne as
sets and makes the credit the coun
try of a little value_to them.
'U look 'forward ^To he benefits of

gade headquarters. "Two of the boys
were using Indecent language and
there were women standing near," the
Council Bluffs lad explained, after he
had regained consciousness at the field
hospital.

-"That m*de mem mat.' One of them
grabbed my r^fle away from me and
hit me over the head with it. I* don't
know what happened after that, but
they have told m? since that the man
who hit me started to run. They
caught him, though, before he got very
far."
A large crowd of visitors and guard
bffjeers on headquarters hill witnessed
the assault and a score of them joined
in the pursuit of the guard who hud
attacked the sentry.
Private Andre Gaylord of Keokuk,
Company L, First infantry, who was on

Rival factions in tho national pro
hibition party are lining up their
forces. today for tho convention.
Whether the name of the party shall
be retained by tho old guard which
has fought forty years for a principle
or captured by tho newir element,
which is willing to change the party's
name and adopt J. M. Parker of Lou
isiana or some other progressive as a
vice presidential candidate, is the chief
function at issue.
Virgil C. Hinshaw, of Chicago, na
tional chairman, said today he believed
the remnant of the progressive party
Is anxious for an Invitation to Join
the' prohibitionists.
"It was Colonel Parker who urged
Mr. Murdock to become a candidate
for the prohibition party's nominatioiT
for vice president," Mr. Hinshaw said.
"His action Saturday in calling a
neW progressive convention leaves me
in the dark as to his intentions. Since
Roosevelt disowned the party we find
many prominent progressives In ad
dition to Colonel Parker have made
overtures to us. One of these la Ray
mond Robins, of Chicago.
"Prohibition leaders discuss serious
ly the advisability of changing name.
Eugene X. Foss, of Massachusetts, has
said the ticket could win In the com
ing election with himself as Its leader
and a new name which would embrace
more than the single Issue of prohi:
bition."
Opposed to the new Ideas of fusion,
change of name and national adoption
of the surviving progressives, are a
number of leading prohibitionists,
among them Eugene W. Chafln, presi
dential nominee In 190R and 1&12.
