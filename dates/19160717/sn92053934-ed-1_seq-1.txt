have completed this piece of legisla

"Therefore, this bill, along with the
ery liberal provisions of the federal

cannot but feci that this is delayed
Justice to them. 1 look forward to the
benefits of this bill, not with extrava

New Chapter
in Casement
Trial Opens
London. July 17. A new chapter ha3
opened in Sir Roger Casement's legal
fight against being executed for high
treason for his activities in the Dublin
revolt. Sir Roger's case today reached
the court of criminal appeal.
Justice Darling, by reason of his
seniority as king's bench judge, pre
sided, with Justices Bray and Sorut
ton on his right and Justices Lawrence
and Atkin on his left.
By special permission Sir Roger
was present. He was attired in a
lounge suit. His face has assumed a
pallor. Sir Roger's counsel upon
opening argument contended that the
law governing treason does not in
clude any offense of adhering to the
king's enemies outside of the realm.
Alexander Sullivan of Dublin, coun
sel for Sir Roger, said the appeal
would involve two questions first
whether the matter described in tho
charge was in truth an offense within
the statute cited; second, whether the
definition of the offense adhering to
the king's enemies given at the read
ing of the trial, was an accurate defini
tion or defective as an instruction to
the jury.
POISONED BEER
CAUSE OF DEATH
Ottumwa, la., July 17. Poisoned
beer is believed to have caused the
death of James Arthur Young of Hed
rick, Iowa, at a local hotel here early
today. In a statement before death.
Young accused a man of giving him
some beer near a depot but neither the
name of the man nor the exact loca
tion of the railroad depot was divulged
by Young. A post mortem ami in
quest will be held later in the day. A
small bottle was found beneath the
hotel window and is held by the
coroner.
no agreement in
imex. situation
Washington, July 17. No agreement
has been reached as yet in the prelim
inary conferences between Acting Sec
retary Folk of the state department
and Kliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambassador-designate,
for settlement of
border difficulties. Mr. Folk author
ized this statement today.
It was indicated that the purpose of
the informal conversations was only to
outline the procedure to be followed
in later negotiations.
A joint commission composed of
diplomatic, military and commercial
representatives of each government is
expected to be the plan adopted, the
preliminary conferences also to estab
lish the specific questions to be de
bated by the commission.
Special Agent Rodgers at Mexico
City, today advised the state depart
ment that he had obtained from the
de facto government an extension until
September of the time in which mining
taxes for the present period of three
months might be paid.
WILSON TO SEND
NOTES TO RULERS
Washington, July 17. Fersonal let
ters probably will be sent by Fresident
Wilson to the king of England, the
president of France, the emperor of
Germany and the emperor of Russia,
urging them to allow food to be sent
from the Cnited States to the starving
people of Poland. The president has
asked the state department to advise
him as to the most desirable way to
proceed. It will be necessary to get
permission for passage of supplies
through the allied blockade and assur
ances from Germany that they will be
used by the Poles and not by the Ger
man army of occupation.

London. July 17 (2io p. m.)
German second line positions
northwest of Bazentin-I.e-IVt.it
wood have been captnred by the
British in a stormy attack, the
war office annonneMl today. The
positions captured in what the
statement characterizes as a "fur
ther important, success" extended
over a front of 1,500 yards.
A strongly held position at Water
tot farm, east of Longtieval, also was
captured by the British, while the re
maining strongholds of the Germans
in Orvillers and La Boisselle also were
taken.
British Front in France, July 17.
(Noon, via Ixmdon, 4:30 p. m.) The
British today captured a German
trench in the neighborhood of Poz
ieres. The capture of the trench
strengthens the new British line in
this vicinity.
The British also cleared out nests
of German machine grun operators
who had been holding out in cellars
and behind barricades in the ruins of
Ovillers and La Boiselle. Otherwise,
the situation along the British, front
is unchanged at this hour.
Germans Short of Food.
A total of about 100 officers and
men surrendered to the British, who
had steadily closed in on them, using
bombs and trench mortars, the Ger
mans being short of food.
In an enormous cellar at Bezantin-Le-Petit
the British found several
hundred wounded Germans who had
taken refuge. It was tragic business
for the British litter-bearers bring
ing them back through the German
shell fire which was meant for the
British- reserves and gun positions.
There were cases where a litter-bearer
was wounded and put on a stretcher
emptied when a German on it had
been killed by the same shell. The
British persisted until all who had
not received a fatal wound in transit
were safe in the rear.
A captured record of a German bat
talion shows that 600 of its number
were killed or wounded by the British
shell fire in the bombardment before
the attack began.

RUSSIAN TROOPS
LAND IN FRANCE
Another Contingent of Czar's Soldiers
Reported Disembarked at Brest
to Reinforce Allies.
Paris, July 17. A contingent of
Russian troops disembarked today at
Brest, France.
The Russian troops will be sent to
camp from Brest, and later to the
front.
This is the sixth contingent of Rus
sian troops, the arrival of which in
France has been reported. Between
April 20 and May 5 there arrived at
Marseilles five bodies of Russian sol
diers, after a land and sea journey of
about 17,500 miles, from Moscow,
where they were assembled, to Port
Dalny, Manchuria, and thence by wa
ter via the Suez canal. The first five
contingents is believed to number
about 1'5,000 men. These troops were
quartered at Camp De Mailly, near
Troyes, for several weeks and then
sent to the front. The official French
communication of last night showed
that Russian troops were in the
trenches in the Champagne.
It was said that the sending of the
first contingents was largely an ex
periment and that they might be fol
lowed by more substantial numbers.
On the former occasion the Russians
arrived without arms, which were
supplied by the French. The explan
ation was given that it was easier to
send men out of Russia's surplus to
the western front than to forward
arms and ammunition to the east-

9 Lives Lost
Raleigh, N. C, July 17. Flood wa

toll of at least nine lives, rendering I
hundreds of persons homeless and
doing property damage variously es
timated at from $10,000,000 to $15,000,
000, were receding today.
The worst conditions obtained in
western North Carolina, where the
flood was described as the most disas
trous in the history of that section.
Asheville and its environs were the
heaviest sufferers, but with train and
telegraph service badly crippled, it
probably will be several days before
the full extent of death and destruc
tion will be determined.
Lower Asheville still was flooded
today by the waters of the French
Broad river which yesterday swept
away mills and other manufacturing
plants and a number of homes. Two
deaths were reported in the city prop
er. Another death occurred at Bilt
more, to the east, and two-score per
sons, including members of a railway
construction gang, who went down
with a bridge, were listed as missing.
Between Asheville and 'Salisbury
railway bridges were washed out on
the Catawba river, and further south
along the same river railroad and
highway bridges were carried away.
Saw mills and other property, as well
as live stock, suffered.
Similar conditions obtained on the
Yadkin river around Lexington, N.
C, and dead animals, wreckage from
mills, cotton, tobacco, oil and other
debris floated down the raging stream.
Salisbury, N. C, July 17. Reports
from Statesville today said three chil
dren were drowned in Alexander
county yesterday when a farm house
was undermined and swept away by
the Catawaba river.
The Catawaba river near States
ville was receding rapidly this after
noon. Damage along the river in Ire
dell, Catawaba and Alexander coun
ties will reac h the millions. The Monho
cotton mills have been completely
carried away, a loss of $100,000, while
the East Monho mills, a larger plant,
has been damaged to the extent of
$100,000. The mills also lost cotton
values at $50,000.
A toll bridge at Statesville was
swept away, costing the county $20,
000 and a $16,000 bridge near Moores
ville is gone.
Asheville, N. C, July 17. Scores of
large industrial plants around Ashe
ville lay idle today in the grip of the
flood that followed last week's rain
storms and hurricane which swept in
from the Carolina coast and flooded
portions of North and South Carolina
and adjacent territory of Tennessee,
Virginia and West Virginia. Five per
sons are known to have been drown
ed, 50 are missing ami hundreds are
homeless, while railroad service vir
tually is suspended on all sides of
Asheville.
The Swannanoa and French Broad
rivers that rose out of their banks
yesterday, flooding the village of Bilt
more and leaving Asheville without
gas or electric light and power, were
said to be receding early today. Es
timates of property damage already
have been placed at from $-,00,0o0 to
$1(1,000.000.
The area that felt the effects of the
flood extends from eastern Tennessee
through southeastern West Virginia,
southwestern Virginia, across North
Carolina to Wilmington, and embraces
virtually all rf South Carolina.

Enjoys Day of Freedom.
Chicago, July 17. William H. Orpet,
acquitted of the murder ot Marian
Lambert by a Lake county jury at
Waukegan Saturday night, spent yes
terday, his first day of freedom since
Feb. 11, far away from the crowds.
The young collegian arose about 6
o'clock yesterday morning and shortly
afterward, accompanied by his mother
and brother Ed went for a long auto
mobile ride in the country about Lake
Forest.
Reports that he went In the direc
tion of River Forest, where Miss
Celestia Youker resides and that he
saw the girl during the day, could not
be verified. Edward O. Orpet, the fath
er, who remained at the home on the
McCormick estate, refused to disclose
his whereabouts and would neither af
firm nor deny the reports regarding
Miss Youker.
The party returned to Lake Forest
last night and Will was let into the
home by one of the several entrances
on the estate. Mrs. Orpet declined to
let her son come to the telephone or to
discuss his trip.
Congratulatory telegrams from all
parts of the middle west addressed to
young Orpet were received during the
day by his father. For the most part
they came from friends of the, family
or from the acquitted youth's ac
quaintances at the University of Wis
consin. Members of the family say they pro
pose to keep Orpet's movements se
cret. It is stated that he will go away
for a time and try to begin life over
under an incognito.
