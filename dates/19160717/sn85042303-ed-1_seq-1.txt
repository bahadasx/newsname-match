DID ISSUE
BUSINESS MEN ARE SEEING THE
NECESSITY OF HAVING SEW
ERS AND WATER MAINS EX
TENDED WITH CITY'S GROWTH
The approaching election to be
held two weeks from tomorrow to
determine whether the city will vote
bonds for the extension of the sewer
and water mains and for other im
provements also for the purchase of
the site and the erection of a spac
ious convention hall is attracting
more attention as the time approach
es. Some at the first were opposed
to voting bonds for any purpose
whatever at this' time, but as the
necessity for the proposed improve
ments is .shown them, opposition cea
ses as a 'rule and they are willing to
assist in putting the bond deal
through.
There has been t-.ncf Is some oppo
sition to voting bonds, but it is not
thought that the opposition will cut
any material figure and that the bond
issue will be authorized.
The city officials In every depart
ment are urging that this be done
in order that these improvements
may begin as soon as possible.
They urge that the necessity is
great as the city has already out
grown the old system and cannot ex
pand as rapidly as it should unless
builders can secure the proper sewer
and water connections.
Ardmore has grown rapidly within
the past two years, and the scholas
tic eenrus today shows it to be a city
of lS.OOO inhabitants. Good houses
in desirable locations are in demand
and no sooner is one finished than a
tenant is waiting to enter it.
For this reason the city officials
are urging the bond issue in' order
that the city may grow and develop
in keeping with the times.
Mrs. Harold Young and son, Gra
ham, have gone to Colorado to s??nd
the summer.

ATTENDED THE
GOOD ROADS MEETING AND CAN
DIDATES IS LARGELY ATTEND
ED AND A GREAT DEAL OF EN
THUSIASM WAS DEVELOPED.
There was a rousing good roads
meeting and candidates rally at the
grove one mile of Milo Saturday, at
tended by nearly every citizen of that
section of the county In which a
great deal of enthusiasm for good
roads was developed. County attor
ney A. J. Hardy, who delivered a good
roads speech which vaa listened to
with marked attention by all. Thurs
day and Friday have been designated
a-s road working days in every pre
cinct In the county and on those
dates every man in the county is ex
pected to contribute two days labor
or hire some one in, his place. The
county commissioners have instruc
ted every road overseer to report at
certain places in each district with
all the tools available and urged the
citizens to co-operate heartily with
them In order to make roads passible
for the fall trade.
It is the ultimate desire of the
county commissioners and all the
business men of th county that a
bond Issue be made for the purpose
of. building permanent roads all over
the county, but pending Lhat issue
it 'is necessary that some temporary
repairs be made on soaie of tho roads
in the county.
The people of the Milo community
propose to. make it the banner dis
trict in the county during the two
days work, that was in evidence
Saturday when they approved the
plan adoptedby the county commis
sioners and the business men of the
city to put these highways in repair.
"The crisis has found the man,"
says the Philadelphia Evening Ledger
of Mr. Hughes, and what the 'crisis'
will do to him will be an overwhelm
ing, plenty. .

TO BE DELAYED
WAR DEPARTMENT ORDERS SOL
DIERS HELD At MOBILIZATION
CAMPS UNTIL PROPER EQUIP
MENT IS SUPPLIED.
Washington, July 16. The war de
partment sent orders today to all de
partment commanders to delay trans
portation to the border or national
guard organizations now mobilizing
until they are thoroughly equipped
and organized. The effect will be to
revoke a ruling issued when the
Mexican situation 'was acute, waiving
certain requirements. The order af
fects about twenty-five thousand men
still held in camps. The latest Infor
mation of the department Is that
about one hundred thousand guards
men are now at the border.
Published reports that use of a gen
eral draft was being considered to
fill the national guard ranks were de
nied officially tonight as "nonsense."
Reports that national guard units
are being supplied poor and insuffici
ent food are not borne out In prelim
inary telegraphic reports received
from all the department commanders
today. These accounts uniformly de
clare that there lids been no food
shortage among the guardsmen, and
that all have been supplied normal
army ration of good quality.
A message from General Funston
today reported that tieneral Trevino
had sent many troops south with the
intention of occupying the Gurrero
San llorjH Santa Uosalla line ngainst
any possible northward advance of
the bandits.. The dispatch added that
newspapers on the Chihuahua side
were urging the necessity of an ac
tive campaign against bandits, "to
prevent their reaching Cnited States
fore s and the border.
. All the candidates will attend a
speaking at Prairie Valley tonight
and several citizens of the city aro
making arrangements to hear them
on the stomp for the first time during
the rresent campaign.
