WASHINGTON. July 17.—Accom
panying the act with a speech pay-'
ing tribute to the farmers of the
country. President Wilson today
signed the rural credits bllL It pro
vides establishment of a system of
land mortgage banks to handle long
time mortgage loans to farmers.
On Invitation of the president, many
interested in the initiation of the
rural credits system were present at
its signing. These Included house
and senate members who bad handled
the bill. Speaking before he signed
the bill, the president said:
"On occasions of this sort there
are so many things to say that one
would despair of saying tbem briefly
and adequately, but I cannot go
through the simple ceremony of sign
ing this bill without expressing the
fellng that I have In signing it." It is
a feeling of profound satisfaction, not
onlyp but of real gratitude that we
have completed, this piece of legisla
tion which I hope will be Immensely
beneficial to the farmers of the coun
try. Farmers, it seems to me, have
occupied hitherto a stagl* pofttton ot
same freedom to get credit on their
real assets that others have had who
were in manufacturing and commer
cial enterprises. And while they sus
tained our life, they did not in the
same degree with others, share in the
benefits of that life. Therefore, this
bill along with the very liberal pro
visions of the federal reserve act puts
them on an equality with all others
who have genuine assets and makes
the great credit of the country avail:
able to them. One cannqjt but feel
this delayed justice to them and can
not but feel that it is a very gratify
ing -thing to play any part in doing
this act of justice. I look forward to
the benefits of this bill, not with ex
travagant expectations, but woth con
fident expectations that it will be of
very wide reaching benefit and inci
dentally. it will be of advantage to
the community for I can imagine no
more satisfactory and tolld invest
ment than this system will afford
those who "have money to use. I sign
the bill, therefore, with real emotion.'
The president started immediately
the task of selecting members of the
rural credits board, provided in the
act.
A large list of applicants for places
includes bankers, mining experts,
scientific farmers and lawyers in
every part of the country. Among
those prominently mentioned are: C.
B. Gegley, master of the state grange
of Washington I* B. Clore, Laporte,

Keegan, who is in St. Louis as me
diator between the Missouri Pacific
and its trackmen, who threaten to
'strike, would not say plans had been
formulated to take over the roads.
However, he said, according to his
Information, this step cannot be
avoided if the men leave their posts.
He said he was practically certain
that the four brotherhoods would
vote to strike.
"But I cannot concur that either the
railroads or the brotherhoods will
let a break occur,** he said. "A com
promise seems more than probable.
However, should the break occur and
nearly half a million men leave their
work, paralyzing transportation and
threatening starvation of the nation,
the government would act in twenty

[•By Willim Philip Simms, United
Press Staff .Correspondent]
PETRQG'RAD, July 17.—Profoundly
impressed by the steady Russlah ad
vance, which see-saws first at this
point and then at that, the Germans,
are massing enormous forces before
KoveL They are bringing up every
available reserve in the hope of stall
ing the new Russian mowing machine.
The present comparative calm is
deemed here to be a mere prelude to
a resumption of heavy, and important
fighting.
The fall of Kovel now would mean
a staggering blow to the central pow
ers, completely disrupting their plans.
Lemberg would be menaced more
than ever, the road to the great fort
ress of Brest Litovsk opened, and the
rear of the entire Pinsk region threat
ened, necessitating the Germans'
withdrawal.
The Russians apparantly do not
lack ammunition. Printed- on the
cartridge cases are the phrases
"Don't spare bulletsr-don't spare
courage. There's enough a-plenty for
all."
Cossacks from the Don, Urals, fresh
young giants from Siberia and else
where are fighting like game cocks,
striving to out-do each other in dare
devil charges. The quarrel with the
Germans Is now personal, owing to
the Germans* use of liquid fire and
gas. Consequently fewer German
prisoners are taken in proportion to
the number of dead on the field.
Russian officers appear satisfied not
only witfl the situation on the Russian
front, but with the spirit of the troops
which they declare was never hisher.

[By Carl W. Ackerman, United Press
Staff Correspondent]
BERLIN, July 17.—Leadlpg Gferman
newspapers are now rallying to. the
support of Chancellor Von Bethmann
Hollweg, who hals been under attacK.
by the advocates of unrestricted sub
marining.
They deny that the chancellor" a
peace discussions have weakened the
position of Germany and reassert
their confidence in the defeat of the
present allied offensive.
The Lokal Anzeiger, commenting
upon the foreign presB interpretation
of the chancellor's opposition to an
nexation of Belgium, declared today:
"It is absolutely grotesque to con
sider the chancellor's position as In
dicating a fear of the military future.
Every judicious-minded German has
strengthened his confidence in the
outcome of the allied offensive."
The Cologne Gazette and other
leading journals are outspoken in
their faith in Van Bethmann-Hollweg.
They declare It would be an insane
move to "swap horses in the middle
of the stream."
For the most part, prominent Ger
mans are not discussing pcace at this
time, preferring to await the outcome
of the allied offensive.
All the critics beNeve that the
British will be unable to recover
from their early failures to make,
great headway, though it is realized
that the fighting is not over. The
Cologne Gazette points out, for in
stance, that the British have huge re
serves in Flanders enabling them to
attack continually with fresh troops.
Major M"oraht, referring to the
operations at Verdun, declared that
the Germans will continue to follow
their present policy of defense by
attack.
Vacation for Veterans.
WASHINGTON, July 17.—Presi
dent Wilson today Issued an executive
order allowing civil war veterans in
government service a leave of absence
with full pay so (hey may attend the
Grand Army encampment in Kansas
City, Mo., August 26 to September 3.
The order also provides the "veterans
be granted as many days additional
leave with pay in each case as long
as necessary for the journey to Kan

duty."

EAGLE PASS, Texas, July 17.—
Carranza troops at Piedras Negras
and Monclovla have moved south to
oppose large Villista forces marching
toward the border, it was learned
from Mexican sources today.
A party of 'Mexicans arriving from
the interior reported today that their
train was held up by Villista bandits
Friday near Torreon and that all
passengers were robbed and every
thing of value taken.
Luis Martinez, of El Paso, said the
Carranza authorities had assured the
party a safe Journey to the border.
He said most of the citizens of. Tor
reon and vicinity were Villa sym
pathizers and that Carranza soldiers
there are deserting to Villa.
Fifteen hundred national guards
men attended the services in the
local Catholic church ,yesterday. The
soldiers served as altar boys, ushers
and choir.

Think Villa is Dead.
WASHINGTON, July 17.—Villa is
dead. General Pershing's troops will
be out of Mexico within a month and
the national guard back home within
three months, a high official said to
day.
Villa's name is being used 'by
minor leaders to Inspire fear among
Carranzistas, the official declared. He
Isaid
Carfanza as stronger today in
Mexico than ever before, principally
because he averted war with the Unit
ed States without loss of dignity by
Mexico.
Army men in touch with border and
Mexican interior conditions said today
there "isn't a chance in a thousand-'
of further trouble with Mexico,
either by a Tepetition of the Parral
and Carrizal Incidents or by bandit
raids.
Since the Carrizal attacic was clear
ed up and the last Carranza note re
ceived, the war department has taken
the view that the Mexican trouble is
over. Pershing's moving his base,
north helped immensely, it was de
clared. Now rains have come and
threaten to necessitate further short
ening of the lines.
"We expect Pershing to be out of
Mexico in a month or so," said a de

German Submarine Freighter

FEARFUL OVER SPIES
Extraordinary Precautions Taken to

BALTIMORE, ML, JflJv 17.—The
German submarine freighter Deutach
land now plans to slip down the
Patapsco river and Into Chesapeake
bay tomorrow night enroots back to
Germany, a member of the crew told
the United Press todw. Loading
should be finished tomorrow at the
present rate. Captain Hlnsch gavs
corroborative indication that the re
turn trip is at hand when he an
nounced no visitors will be permitted
to board the vessel after tomorrow.
Captain Hlnsch told the United
Press he expects the Bremen in a
few days and that she will come here
or to New York, though he indicated
Baltimore will be the port
Fear of spies and bombs seemed to
be strongly upon the crew and manar
gers of the Deutschland today.
The vigilance of the past week had
Increased. Even police officials who
had been permitted free entrance to
her pier were barred, a special watch
man headed off messengers and mail
carriers all night the powerful
searchlight on the tug Timmlns play
ed nervously over the waters to plok
up launches and to search the shore
for unwelcome watchers.
"Drive them away quick," was the
shout from the Timmlns to the police
on shore when the searchlight reveal
ed newspaper "spies." "For heavens'
sake don't let them stay there."
A special delivery messenger ar
rived at the Eastern Forwarding dock
with a small package, presumably a
gift from an admirer to Captain
IOieUg.
"You can't come in here," said the
German guard abruptly. "I won't take
that package."
The messenger was surprised.
"Will you write that down, or HI
get in trouble," he replied. And the
guard wrote it, unmistakably with
the added information that there is
no use trying to deliver any package
At the dock. The inference from this
generally is that the Deutschland folk
fear an attempt to wreck the ship.
The Deutschland dressed up In
fresh green paint and decorated with
traces of white at the bow and stern
to resemble the ocean waves, still lay
at the pier today. It had been an
nounced that Captain KBenig would
go to New York to see Ambassador
Uernstorff and bring back a packet
of diplomatic mall, but Manager Hil
ken said this afternoon "the captain
will stay right here."
Hlnsch, master of transportation
for the Eastern Forwarding Co.
Deutschland agents, said emphatically
today that there will be no Americans
on the submarine when she returns.
They woujd not protect her," he
added.

helm was at the'flbnume front when
his army retreated under battering
British blows in Saturday"* fighting,
it became known today.
An official statement Iscroed at Bsr
lln confirmed previous reports of the
kaiser's presence on the front of
the great Anglo-French offensive,*
where he has been visiting his
troops and inspiring them to a more
stubborn defense. The Berlin state
ment said that the katser conferred
with his chief of staff and com
manding generals, -visited the hos
pitals and conferred swreral Iron'
crosses.
Press dispstch.es from the British
front today brought new details of
the successful attacic on Saturday in
which tie woods of iDetrille and
iBazentta-gje-iPetlt were captured and
the SrSTlsh at one point penetrated
enemy third line trenches.
These dispatches shewed Chat the
British advance carried the. forward
lines to the outskirts at ba«h the
villages of Poxleres and Martin
pulch, two of the most strongly da
fended German posts before Ba -fl
paume.
The assault was began Just baSor*
daylight on a moonlight night, II
followed an artillery attack, which
for intensity, if not duration, exceed
ed the bombardment that marked
the beginning of the Anglo-French ,*'JL
offensive two weeks before.
British guns blotted out enemy
wprtes, leaving only ruined redoubts
from behind whloh German machine
gunners raked the attacJoers until v.-
blown to pieces by bonjbs.
The fighting for Longueval on
Friday was a bitter battle from un
derground works and cellars.
"In some of the cellars, the Ger
mans fought like wolves at bay,"
wired one correspondent "Down in
the darkness of these places, men
fought savagely, seeing only tOie
glint of each others eyes and feeling
for each others throats unless there
were still bombs handy to make a
quicker ending. It was primitive
warfare, cavemen fought like that In
such darkness, though not wlta
bombs which belong to our own age."
The British left flank near Ovil
lleres and Laboisselle, made further
progress, capturing the remaining
strongholds and the "brave remnants"
of a German garrison, General Halg
reported.
