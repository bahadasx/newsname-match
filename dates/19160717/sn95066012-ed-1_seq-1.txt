special equipment preparatory to being
placed in commission. A crow of five
men has been assigned to the new car.
transferred from one of the old Wooden

The car Is entirely of steel, Includ
ing ull interior bulkheads, partitions,
doors, berths, lockers, and water tanks
and Is thoroughly insulated by the lat
est Improved method to insure against
heat and cold. It has a length of GO
feel and one-half inch over ends of
body plates, and a standard width of
10 feet. The weight of the car with
equipment is 15n,uun pounds, and is de
signed to carry a load of 35,oou pounds
including water, fuel, Ice and other
supplies, making its total weight when
loaded. 185,0ml pounds, or i2'.a tons.
The ear is especially designed for
earning live fishes long distances. In
the center, running lengthwise on each
side, are insulated tanks with a total
capacity for L',o ten-gallon cans In
which the llsh are held. During trans
portation the fish will be furnished
with oxygen and fresh water by means
of air and water pumps, operated by a
six horse-power steam holler. Tin

but In addition to this independent
heating system the usual train at

Including. In addition to tishos. the
lobster and several species of econ
omically valuable fresh-water mussels.
'he total out put of these was over
four and a half billions, which were
planted In every state and Alaska.
Some Idea Of the magnitude of the
work of distributing iish is Indicated
by the fact Hint It Involved 687,716
miles to travel, of which 14t!.54l was
by the bureau's special cars and the
remainder by tar messengers, These
marine and fresh-water llshes arc in

2,445,664 motor vehicles were regis

paid a total of $18,245,713 for registra
