adopt the plank contained in the Re

is as follows: -1 1; -
"Believing: tha the continued dis

EMIL A. BERNDT PICKED
FOR PARTY'S CHAIRMAN
George W. Smith Permanent
Chairman of Convention;
May Close Tonight
Republicans of the territofy are as
sembled tn convention today and har
mony -reigns supreme. In fact one
delegate, after surveying the calm
situation at the Bijou theater, where
the convention - gathered, remarked
that it's "disgustingly peaceful."
AH fights and possible fights are
being settled in committee instead of
on the floor of the house. And at
that nothing resembling a real fight
has ever even loomed above the
horizon.: A few objections to plat
form, planks have arisen, but ho
scrap even remotely resembling the
bitter battles of the past, when faction
was arrayed against faction.
. The two big pieces of business be
fore the convention are the adoption
of the territorial platform and the
election of the territorial central com
mittee. No important fight has de?
veloped ' over either. The platform
committee Is., in session now, thresh
ing out among" Its own membership
the Small-sized differences of opinion,
and no J contest has developed over
the territorial committee places.
' Emit A. Berndt of the second pre
cinct Oahu, is the man now spoken
of for chairman of the territorial
committee, which means chairman of
the Republican party in Hawaii. No
opposition to him has shown Itself up
to a late hour, today, and, on the other
hand, members of both the Kahio and
Rice wings of. the party two years ago
said , this 'morning ; that - they favor
him? t1!-;..!' r ".-r.'v rih "v ' - j.
Convention Moves Slowly
Having cpmparatlvely little busi
ness to attend - to and ' plenty of time
for It; the convention Is moving slow
ly. It got under way about 9:30 this
morning, and after effecting penmen
ent , organization and ' naming its plat
form v committee, adjourned at 11:30
to meet at 7:30 f onight Meanwhile
