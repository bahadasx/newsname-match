NEW COALITION PUIS TO

Military Chiefs, Backed By Rich Mexican Exiles Are Said

COALITION" of military forces in
Mexico and wealth Mexican ex
iles in the United States is re
ported to have formed a project for
the restoration of peace in Mexico and
the substitution of a representative
government for what they consider the
: dictatorship of Venustiano Carranza.
Gen. Felipe Angeles, former chief of
artiller for Francisco Villa, and Man
uel Bonillas. a former Villa cabinet of
ficer, axe said to have left here Friday
for "Washington for a conference with
assistant secretary of state Polk. As
surances from a number of wealth ex
iles that they are ready to finance a
new movement in Mexico are to be
laid before the state department, ac
cording to current reports, on condition
that they be granted amnesty and per
mission to return to Mexico to resume
charge of their properties.
Vaiuuer Tajsle for President.
Vasquez Tagle. a. secondary leader in
the Maderista party, is said to have
been selected by the new party to be
provisional president of Mexico pend
ing the holding of an election in the
republic to select a constitutional
president. As senior member of the Ma-
d.ero cabinet. Tagle claims to be the
legal successor as provisional presi
dent and that he should have been
president when Huerta took charge
of the government as dictator.
jITade was considered for the same po
sition vnire Dciure uui wls jiui luvuui
to be of sufficient strength to handle
the situation.
De La Bam Proposed.
Frapcisco de la Barra-has also been
mentioned as provisional president
pending an election. He "was pro
visional president between the time
president Diaz abdicated and Madero's
election. He is considered one of the
few really strong men of Mexico to
day, but because of his part in the
famous coup de etat in which Huerta
seized control of the government, it is
considered doubtful if De la Barra
would be acceptable to the United
States.
