Every one coming from the front
remarks upon the paucity of German j
aeroplanes and antiaircraft guns, de- |
spite the re-enforcements in other arms, j
British airmen in many instances have J
descended as low as 300 or 500 feet, ,
tiring upon German infantry with their j
machine guns, and receiving tlie cheers !
of British infantry. Such low (lights:
have resulted in remarkably intimate 1
scouting.
The scene of action has been carried]
for the first time beyond the second;
main line of cerman defenses since
stationary warfare began on the we.st.- j
ern front. Officers returning from the j
front line speak of seeing abandoned ,
German guns, but say they arc too;
busy fighting each other to bring them!
in.
The most dramatic scene comes when i
the German gunners strive to draw off;
their guns with British infantry within
rifle range. In the grinding conflict,
which is courageously fought at close. |
quarters, neither the ground taken nor j
the number of prisoners is expressive
of the results <>f the stake for which
sides are fighting.
Among the documents captured is the
complaint of a division commander of
the destruction of a German battalion
by their own gunfire.
It is difficult for any one not at the
front to realize the change in the new
army wrought by these two weeks,
thanks to the first continued offensive
which is giving the troops practical les
sons day by day.

JOSEPH AUBREY USHER'
IS DROWNED III GREEK
Meets Heath in Chesterfield County
While Out With Picnic
Party.
HODY IS MXALLY KKCOViOKKD
Will He \"icwe<l hy Coroner Loving
To-Day?Physicians Say He Was
Victim of Cramps?Xo Witness of
Hrow ning.
Seized with ??ramps while- bathing:
with several companions at Falling
Creek ? 'liosterfiehl County, yesterday
afternoon shortly after 3 o'clock, Joseph
Aubrey Asher. nineteen years old, son
of .Mrs. K. C. Asher. of ?1.1 West Mar
shall Street, was drowned His body
was not recovered until last night at j
7 o'clock. It will be viewed to-day
by Coroner J. <1. Loving, who was away
from home last night.
The drowning brought a tragic end
to an outing being enjeved by a party
composed of twenty young people. No
one saw Asher when he disappeared
beneath the water, it being at least
five minutes before he ?as missed.
Persons familiar with Aslier's ability
and the conditions of the water at
the point were certain that he could
not have been drowned, and it was
at first thought that he was playing
a prank. However, a search was in
stituted for him, and when he was not
located within a reasonable time, real
alarm was felt for his safety.
The minutes stretched into hours, and
aid from Richmond was sent for. When
the body was finally found, examina
tion by physicians, several of whom
had been summoned, disclosed the fact
that the young man must have met
death within a few minutes after he
was first missed. The doctors were
confident that he was a victim of
cramps, having entered the water a
short while after eating lunch.
WAS til'KST AT Ol'TIM'i
WITH I'ARTt OP YOIWC; I'liOIM.E
The outing was piven bv Miss Louise
Jones, of .111 Kast Broad Street, and
the hoys and girls, chaperoned hy Mrs.
c. Si Jones, left Richmond yesterday
morning at II o'clock by trolley car.
Asher was not with the party at that
time, Joining the other members later
in the day, goine to Falling Creek in
an automobile.
After enjoying a picnic luncheon,
where Asher was one of the merriest
of the party, others suggested a swim.
With two companions he went into
the water, and tlicy were sporting
themselves, when Asher was suddenly
found to be missing. At that time
there was no thought that, he had
found a watery grave. However, hope
soon gave away to alarm, and feat
was overcome by despair when trace
of the young man was not found after
hours of search.
Many volunteered in the search, and
it was nearly dark before one of sev
eral men. who were diving, found the
body at a spot believed to be within
a few feet, of where the youth sank.
Coroner Loving was not mod, and he
cause it was learned that he would
probably not return before to-day, the
body was left at Falling Creek, pend
ing an Inquest.
Besides his mother the youth leaves
five brothers and three sisters.
This is said to be the first drowning
in Falling Creek proper in the past
twenty years. Several fatalities In the.
past few years have, been reported as
taking place in Falling Creek, when,
in reality, they have either been at
the creek's mouth, in the James River
or at Drewry's Bluff.

Friends of Judge Thomas W. Harrison,
of ? Winchester, to-day authorized the
statement that he will not be a can

in Congress to succeed Representative
James Hay. but if ho is nominated be
will accept. They added that they in ?
i tend to present his name, it was be
lieved here yesterday that Judge Har
rison would resign from the bench to
make the race for Congress, but his
friends to-day declared that this Im
pression is erroneous.
A sharp struggle for the Democratic
nomination in the. Seventh District is
impending. It was learned to-day that
j the congressional committee has Hu
rler consideration plans for calling a
convention to make the nomination, in
stead of a primary. It was pointed
out that the primary could not be
held- undct' the State law, as the time
for making arrangements for such an
election has expired, and there is no
special provision in the statute to
cover the situation which has arisen
in the Seventh District.
TWO C.WDIDATBS
Wll.l. ni-: NAMKD
Two candidates for Congress will
have to be named?one, for the short
and the other for the long term. Mr.
ITay's resignation will become effec
tive within the next two months, and
a Representative to serve the short
winter session necessarily will have to
be elected. The talk heard in Wash
ington is that, if a convention is call
ed. the candidate, nominated for the
short term, will also be nominated for
the long term. In order to prevent
the confusion of the name of one can
didate appearing twice on the ballot
in the regular November election. Gov
ernor Stuart will be asked to call a
special election in October for the
short, term.
If a convention is called, it is prob
able that every county in the district
will bring out its favorite son. News
received here to-day from the Seventh
District is that l-'rodcrick will ud
