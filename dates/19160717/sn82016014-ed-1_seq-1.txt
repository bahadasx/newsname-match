U. S. AT THROTTLE
Government to Seize Railroads
if Strike Is Called.
Threat Is Made by Head of De
fc partment of Labor.
St. Louis. July 17. Declaring that
the United States government was
better prepared now than ever before
to operate the railroads of the coun
try. J- J- Kecgan, commissioner of the
department of labor, predicted the
government would take over the roads
should the four great railroad broth
erhoods call a strike of their mem
bers. Keegan said that once the gov
ernment took charge of the roads the
men would go to work immediately
He based this assertion on the fact
that the government had long since
recognized the eight-hour day, one
of the bones of contention in the
present controversy.
Would Act in 24 Hours.
He would not say that plans had
been formulated to take over the
roads. However, he expressed the
opinion that this step could not he
avoided :n the event the men left their
work.
"But I cannot conceive that either
the railroads or the brotherhoods will
let a break occur," he said. "A com
promise seems more than probable.
However, shoi'ld the break occur and
nearly a half million men leave their
work, paralyzing transportation and
thieatening starvation of the nation,
the government would act in 24 hours.
"It could do nothing else. F.very
railroad in the country would be
seized, and once the roads pass into
the control of the government they
woulri never again be returned to
their former private owrship."
TODAY WAS HOTJNOUGH, TOO
At 3 O'clock Today First Rain
in 20 Days.
The Mercury Falls 21 Degrees
in One Hour.
A cloudy sky saved Sunday's rec
ord from being broken today. Also
about 2 o'clock the wind whipped up
to about 6 miles an hour.
But; at that, the mercury Jiggled
back and forth in the tube between
90 and 93 degrees, making the heat
but little more bearable. At 2 o'clock
the mercury registered 93. The high
est temperature Sunday was 99, the
highest for two years.
Beginning at 1 o'clock this after
noon thunder showers appeared In
several directions around Topeka. As
a result the thermometer took a wel
come tumble.
At 2:30 o'clock a shower originat
ing in the southeast and swinging to
the east threw a spray of cool air over
the city and sent the mercury down
below the 90 mark 89 to be exact.
A thundershower swept over the
business section and east part of To
peka this afternoon.
The rainfall was .14 of an inch. The
downpour was heavy.
Between 2 o'clock and 3:05 o'clock
the temperature fell from 93 to 72
a drop of 21 degrees.
Topekans were agreeably sur
prised shortly before 3 o'clock this
afternoon by black clouds sweeping
over the city, in a promise of show
ers. Rain began to fall at 2:50
o'clock.
This afternoon S. D. Flora, fore
caster, said there might be scattered
showers over the state this afternoon
and tonight, but said they ..would, not-fc-i
be heavy enough to amount to any
thing. '
The temperature today was 6 de
grees above normal.
Intermittent local showers fell
shortly after noon today south and
southeast of Topeka within a radius of
twenty-five miles, according to reports
received in Santa Fe offices.

There had been no rain, other than
unmeasurable local showers, in To- j
peka for twenty days. I
Today's weather might be better or t
it might be worse as it has been in the
past. July i7, 1887, the temperature j
was 104. The lowest record was in
1900, when it was 68.
Topeka, city of sweltering night, I
awakened this morning, mopped its
brow, figuratively speaking, of course,
and settled down to the uncomfortable
task of watching the mercury start
racing toward the top of the tube. It
was the hottest night In two years.
There was no breeze, other than a
clammy one stirring at a rate of be
tween 3 and 4 miles an hour. The 1
lowest temperature was 76 at 6 o'clock
this morning.
Last midnight, Rudyard Kipling's
vivid description of a sweltering city

to Topeka without alteration. Only a

"LET IT BREAK"
Mayor Expresses Himself About
the Light Plant.
Believes Current Can Be Bought
From Edison Cheaper.
Denial that there Is any combina
tion of commissioners to boot the re
quest of Frank Newland, water and
light commissioner, for a new turbo
generator in the city light plant out
of the 1917 budget was made today
by Mayor J. E. House. Tfiat was not
all. The mayor asserted if Newland
could show the generator is needed
as badly as he says it is, he will get it.
However, the mayor expressed
doubt that the dynamo is needed any
more this year than it was last.
"We killed the item for the machine
last year," said the mayor, "because
we could get along without it, and a
cut had to be made somewhere to get
the general revenue fund inside the
amount allowed by law. We will, if
Mr. Newland puts in his request for
the generator, investigate his claims
before acting.
"We are not going to cripple any
department: it would be a reflection
on all the commissioners as well as the
head of the department.
"I believe if the plant breaks down
we can connect up with the Edison
company in a half hour and get cur
rent cheaper than we can make it."
Newland has prepared a supplement
to his budget wherein he asks $17,
000 for the generator. He is negotiat
ing with the other commissioners be
fore turning it in to Commissioner
Wasson.
The city of Topeka, after its fight
for the preservation of the municipal
plant which has saved the city thou
sands of dollars, is not going to aban
don its successful enterprise and go
to buying electricity.
The State Journal dislikes to see so
sensible a man as the mayor take the
position of "Let It Break." No busi
ness man conducting a factory, no cor
poration, unless it be a city, would
think of adopting such a policy.
It is the business of the city of To
peka to keep up Its machinery. Thou
sands of candlo power have been
addsd in white way lamps. Including
the state house, and the new street
lamps since last year and new ma
chinery must be added, just as it must
be added to a newspaper plant to take
care of new business. Let the com
mission live up fully to its promise
to be business-like. Editor Stato

BY WILLIAM PHILIP SIMMS.
Petrograd, July 17. Profoundly im
pressed by the steady Russian ad
vance, which see-saws first at this
point and then at that, the Germans
are massing enormous forces before
Kovel. They are bringing up every
available reserve in the hope of stall
ing the new Russian mowing machine.
The present comparative calm is
deemed here to be a mere prelude to
a resumption of heavy and important
fighting.
The fall of Kovel now Would be a
staggering blow to the central pow
ers, completely disrupting their plans.
Lemberg would be menaced more than
ever, the road to the great fortress of
Brest Litavsk opened, and the rear of
the entire Pinsk region threatened,
necessitating the Germans withdraw
ing. Plenty or Ammunition.
The Russians apparently do not lack
ammunition. Printed on the cartridge
cases are tne phrases:
"Don't spare bullets don't spare
courage. There's enough a plenty
for all."
Cossacks from the Don; Urals, fresh
young giants from Siberia and else
where, are fighting like game cocks,
striving to outdo each other in dare
devil charges. The issue with the
Germans is now personal owing to the
Germans use of liquid fire and gas.
Consequently few German prisoners
are taken in proportion to-the num
ber of dead on the field.
Russian officers appear satisfied not
only with the situation on the Rus
ssion front but with the spirit of the
troops which they declare was never
higner.
Loss Includes 14,900 Officers.
Berlin. July 17. According to of
ficial reports from Petrograd, says the
Overseas News agency, "in the period
between the beginning of the Russian
offensive and July 1 the number of
killed reached 14.900 officers and 248,
000 men. Included among the officers
were seventeen generals and twenty-
nine commanders.
"Advices from Stockholm -say the
Russian finance minister. having
railed to obtain a loan from England
and France, undertook negotiations
with bankers in the united States,
which also failed. England declared
that the cost of the war to herself had
reached such a point that it has be
come impossible to assist her allies.
"The Russian newspaper Rech, com
menting on this situation, most vio
lently insults Americans ' for their
"egotism," saying that at last. The
mask of sympathy for the allies has
been torn from their faces.

JUST UTTLE SUMMER TROUBLE
No Cause for Calls In Majority
of Day's Alarms.
So Infantile Disease Yet Re
ported In This City.
In fear and dread lest their owa
babies be seized with Infantile paraly
sis, hundreds of Topeka mothers are
spending sleepless nights. And To
peka doctors are the victims of the
gnawing fear that causes anxious
mothers to look in baby's eyes, study
symptoms from a reading of the daily
press dispatches and rush frantically
to a telephone and call the doctor.
Following faithful vigils through the
long hours of a hot summer night,
many Topeka mothers have suddenly
been seized with the conviction that
baby has been grasped by the disease
that is Just now causing natlon-wids
concern. Almost every physician in
Topeka has answered from a half
dozen to a half hundred calls to deter
mine whether infantile paralysis had
really reached out to claim a baby
life. And always the doctor has re
turned to his office or his home after
his record dash and waited for the
next call he knew would come.
Power of Suggestion.
Maybe the heat has combined with
the power of suggestion in , news
stories and has caused a season of gen
eral unrest in all homes where baby
has been feverish or colicky or fretful.
In any event baby's diet and surround
ings are watched by hundreds of in
tensely nervous and anxious Topeka
mothers mothers who watch the flies
from baby's crib as they read bulletins
from the board of health and sugges
tions from specialists. Then as they
read, suddenly some action on baby's
part drives home to mother the con
viction that Infantile paralysis had
entered the home. Away off in a re
mote end of the city, perhaps, the

BQARForHEALTHRULE
State Requests Cleanup Owing to In
fantile Paralysis Scare.
In an effort to do all that is possi
ble to prevent the spread of infantile
paralysis in Kansas, the state board
of health, through Dr. 8. J. Crumbine,
secretary, today issued the following
resolution to be passed by county
boards of health:
"An appalling epidemic Is sweeping
New York City and adjacent territory
and slowly spreading along the chan
nels of transportation of other cities
and states. It behooves Kansas to
mobilize her resources of defense to
stay the epidemic should it reach her
borders.
"The state board of health, co-operating
with the school of medicine of
the University of Kansas, is prepared
to use her experts in the service of
the state should the disease appear in
epidemic form. But what is most de
sired is to take such steps as may, in
a measure, prevent the disease from
spreading. Therefore, the state board
of health urgently requests that each
county board of health pass and en
force the following resolution:
"Whereas, it has been shown that
human discharges may contain the
organisms that produce epidemic pol
iomyelitis (infantily paralysis) and
"Whereas, human fecal matter and
urine may contain the organisms that
produce typhoid fever and other in
testinal diseases, and
"Whereas, the outside toilet that is
open to the house-fly furnishes the
necessary link between this dangerous
human filth and the food and drink
that may be polluted by flies, ' and
thus spread these diseases,
"Therefore, be it resolved by the
county board of health, that
all outside toilets shall be, and are
hereby ordered to be, made fly-proof
immediately, and that all breeding
places for flies, such as accumulations
of stable manure and decaying vege
tation, be scattered upon the fields,
burned or buried.
"Be it further resolved, that our
county health officer be and he is
hereby Instructed to see that this or
der is enforced, and that all outside
toilets be flyproofed and nut in a ian.
itary condition on ir before August 1,

health."
