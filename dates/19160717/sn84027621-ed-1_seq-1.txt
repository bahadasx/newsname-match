Garranza Shrewd Enough to
Avert a Crisis
SKILL 111 DIPLOMACY OF FIRST
DEHT OF THE
StrLouis, July 16.A special from
Monterey to the Post-Dispatcn says:
Mexicans of business prominence
who have arrived here from the City
of Mexico during the last few days
are unanimous in agreeing that the de
facto government won a victory over
the United States in the diplomatic
avoidance of the recently threatened
crisis. Luis Cabrero, who is said to be
"First Chief" Carranza's chief politi
cal advisor, is given credit for giving
the de facto government at least a
temporary lease of life by his shrewd
diplomatic treatment' of the acute sit
uation with the authorities at Wash
ington. It is now an open secret that Car
ranza believed at one timet immediate
ly f pllowing the order for the mass
ing of the national guard of the dif
ferent states upon the Rio' Grande,
that war was inevitable. He had lit
tle confidence in the assurance of Cab
rero that the threatened break be
tween the countries might possibly be
avoided by diplomatic note writing of
which he has already proved adept.
Carranza well knew that the much
vaunted opposition to the prospective
American military invasion had no
real existence; he knew; that his own
army was a mere shell; he knew that
the whole fragment of his so-called
government would fly to pieces almost
the moment the American troops
crossed the border in any force.
Here is the proof of the way Car
ranza felt about it,: according to the
Mexican statements. When news of
the big troop movement towards Mex
ico came to him he deserted the presi
dential palace and took up his abode
in a Pullman sleeping car in the rail
road yards. To this car was attached
a locomotive with steam up and ready
to move out at a moment's warning.
Wholesale desertions of Carranza
troops in Northern and Central Mex
ico have taken place since the reap
pearance of Francisco Villa upon the
field of action. Villa's raid upon Co
lumbus, N. M., has made him the pop
ular hero of the masses of Mexicans
all over the country" The Carranza
soldiers hold him almost in reverence.
They are flocking to his standard by
the hundred
Brigandage is becoming more and
more rampant in almost every part
of the country. Scores of roving
bands, of outlaws are preying upon
the defenseless and suffering people
in nearly every state. Many men of
the lower arid middle classes who were
formerly of unblemished respectabil
ity now find themselves facing the al
ternative of either turning robber or
starving to death. They are forced to
steal for the sake of their families as
well as for themselves. '
The authority of the defacto gov
ernment is absolutely nil, with the ex
ception of in the City of Mexico, and
a very few of the other larger cities.
As a matter of fact, there is little
semblance of government anywhere in
Mexico.
It is the general opinion in financial
circles here that the borrowing in the
United States or elsewhere of $100
000,000 or any sura by the de factor
government would prove but of small
temporary benefit to that tottering
element of the nation's political dis
turbers. This amount of new and real
money in the country would only serve
to intensify the activity of the other
revolutionary factions, it is claimed.
No thinking man in Mexico believes
that American intervention has been
prevented by the recent turn of events.
The crisis has slpaply been deferred
and the job which they think is in
evitable, probably made all the hard
er.
An auto party consisting of Messrs.
John Needham, John Robinson, Willie
Needham, Jim Scott and Nelson Dpsh
went to Gainesville Sunday in John
Needham's Reo car. They report the
roads in Marion county in good shape,

party left here at 10:20 a. m. and ar
rived at the Alachua Cafe at 12:50;
leaving Gainesville at 9:45 p. m. and

GREAT INFLUX OF BUSINESS,
FOLLOWS ANNOUNCEMENT
OF NEW PRICE
The Public Displays a Deep Interest
in Standardized Car at
Less Money
. When the Maxwell Motor company
announced July l.the generous reduc
tion m price on its' touring car and
roadster, the executives were prepared
for a somewhat increased demand for
the Maxwell product. But they were
not prepared for the tremendous in
flux of business that followed on the
heels of the announcement.
Since the new Maxwei prices be
came effective, the great increase of
business has been felt in every de
partment of the organization. This in
crease has been reflected in the in
creased demand upon Maxwell dealers
all over the country.
"The 1916 season was a most pros
perous one," said R. R. Carroll, local
dealer fjor the Maxwell company, "but
if early indications count for any
thing, the 1917 season will surpass
anything in the "history of the auto
mobile industry. There is no question
but - that the company's policy in
standardizing their car and selling it
at a figure that would appeal to peo
ple of moderate means will be justified
by the increased business.
At the company's general ofHces
in Detroit, letters and telegrams from
thousands of cities, towns and village.?
all over the country followed the an
nouncement . of the redeced price.
Prospective buyers and automobile
dealers fairly deluged the company
with requests for catalogs and other
literature.
It Pleases the Farmers
"Reports from the agricultural dis
tricts about the country indicate that
farmers are intensely interested in
the Maxwell announcement. One Iowa
farmer wrote that he had always
maintained that eventually it would be
possible to buy a real automobile for
the price of a good horse and buggy.
He declared that a really high-class
driving horse costs well over $300,
while the buggy an dequipment brings
the cost up to a few hundred dollars
additional. There, he said, you have
the, same amount of money required to
buy a Maxwell, a high-grade motor
car, whose upkeep will prove far less
than the upkeep of a driving outfit.
"The response to the 1917 announce
ment of the Maxwell from both cities
and country has been exceptional ar.d
all the signs predict a record-breaking
year." -' "
