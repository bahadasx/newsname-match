Germans Profoundly Impressed by Apparently Resistless

Allies On Western Front Terrific Slaughter Still
1 Goes On
By William Philip Simms
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Petrograd, July 17. Profoundly impressed by the
steady Russian advance, which see-saws first at this
point and then at that, the Germans are massing enorm-j
ous forces before Kovel. They are bringing up every
available reserve in the 'hope of stalling the new Russian
mowing machine.
The present comprehensive calm is deemed here to be
a mere prelude to a resumption of heavy and important
fighting.
The fall of Kovel now would be a staggering blow to
the Central powei's, completely disrupting their plans.
Lemberg would be menaced more than ever, the road to
the great fortress of Brestlitoysk opened, and the rear
of the entire Binsk region threatened, necessitating a
German withdrawal.
The Russians apparently do not lack ammunition.
Printed on the cartridge cases are the phrases:
"Don't spare bullets don't spare courage. There's
enough a-plenty for all."
Cossacks from the Don, Urals, fresh young giants
from Siberia and elsewhere are fighting like game cocks,

British Still Advance
By tSA I. Keen
(United Press staff correspondent)
London, July 17. British troops
stormed and captured German second
line positions on a front of 1300 'yards
in a continuation of the steady drive
north of the Bomme, Gen. Haig re
ported this afternoon.
The advance was made northwest of
Baxentine-Le Petit n-oods, which is
now in the hands of the British and
pressed the British line forward to
the very edges of the Martinpuich vil
lage, one of the German strongholds,
defending Biipnume.
Kaiser Wilhelm was nt f.ie Somme

battering British blows in Saturday's

An official statement Issued nt Ber
lin confirmed previous reports of the
kaiser's presence on the front of the
great Anglo-French offensive where
he has been visiting his troops and in
spiring them to a more stubborn de
fense. The Berlin statement said that
the kaiser conferred with his chief of
.staff and commanding generals, vis
ited the hospitals and conferred sev
eral iron crosses.
Press dispatches from the British
front today brought new details of the
successful attack on Saturday in which
the woods of Belvllle and Bnzent'm-Le
Petit were captured and the P.ritisn
at one point penetried enemy third
line trenches,
Tiiese dispatches showed that the

positions before Bapaume. The as
sault was begun just before daylight
on a moonlight night. It followed an
artillery attack which, for intensity,
if not duration, exceeded the bombard
ment that marked the Anglo-French
offensive two weeks before. British
guns blotted out enemy works, leaving
only ruined redoubts from behind
which German machine gunners raked
the attackers until blown to pieces by
bombs.
The fighting for Longtieval on Fri
day was a bitter battle from under
ground works and cellars.
"In some of the cellars, the Germans
fought like wolves at bay," wired one
correspondent, "down in the darkness
of these places men fought savagely
seeing only the glint of each other's
eiyes mnd fd'ing for each others
throats unless there were still bombs
haudy to make a quicker ending. It
was primitive warfare, cave men
fought like that in such darkness,
though not with bombs which belong
to our own age."
The German war office admitted that
the British have made further progress
toward the important highway town of
Pozierej, penetrating Ovilliers wood,
southrwest of l'ozieres, where heavy
fighting continues. The Berlin official
! statement reported lively fighting west

The German war office this afternoon
officially admitted that General Von

been compelled to retreat behind the

SAYS GOVERNMENT

Department of Labor Official
Says This Will Happen If
Great Strike Conies
St. Louis, Mr., July 17. Declaring
that the United States government
was .better prepared now than ever to
operate the railroads of the country,
J. J. Keegan, of the department of la
bor, predicted today that the govern
ment would take over the roads should
the four great railroad brotherhoods
call a strike of their men.
Keegan said that once the govern
ment took charge of the roads the men
would go to work immediately. He
based this assertion on the fact the
government had long since recognized
the eight hour day, one of the bones of
contention in the present controversy
between men and employers,
Keegan, who is in St. Louis as me
diator between the Missouri Pacific
However he said that, according to his
information, this .step cannot bo a
voided if ' the men leave their posts.
He said he was practically certain
that the four brotherhoods-would vote
to strike.
"But I cannot conceive that either
the railroads or the brotherhoods will
let a break occur," he said. "A com
promise seems more probable. Howev
er should the break occur and nearly
a half million men leave their work,
naralvzing transportation and threat
ening starvation of the nation, the
government would act in executive
hours. I could do nothing else. Every
railroad in the country would be selz
ed and once these roads pass into the
control of the United States they
would never again be returned to pri
vate ownership."

Inventor Claims to Have Per

Snn Francisco, July 17 Announce
ment of a wireless subterranean tele
phone was made today by Dr: H. Bar
ringer Cox, one of the most prominent
electrical inventors of the country.
Simultaneous v lr. Cox declared that
he had discovered that electrical ener
gy can be transmitted over a single
conductor, a new law of physics.
The inventor made h's discovery, ne
said, while he was experimenting for
the federal foreBt service in an ef
fort to perfect a wireless system of sig
nals in forest reserves. He discovered
that the human voice could be trans
mitted through the ground. He tried
out his discovery over distances up to
AO miles and then applied for patents
on it.
Ir. Cox said the system of subter
ranean wireless telephony Is so simple
that ' it is astonishing that ' scientists
have not discovered it long ago. '
I 'The. equipment consists of an ordi

.(Uqited Press staff correspondent.)
Baltimore, Md., July 17. The Ger
man submarine freighter Deutschland
now plans to slip down the Patausco
river and into Chespakeawe bay tomor
row night, on route back to Germany,
a member of the erew told the United
Press today. Loading should be finish
ed tomorrow at the present rate. Cap
tain Hinsch gave cororborative informa
tion that the return trip is at hand
when he announced no visitors will be
permitted to board the vessel after to
morrow.
Captain Hinsch told the United Press
he expected the Bremen in a few days
and that she will come here or to New
York, though he indicated Baltimore
will be the port. -Fear
of spies and bombs seemed to
bear strongly upon the crew and man
agers of the Deutschland today.

increased. Even police officials who
had been permitted free entrance to her
pier were barred, t -special watchman
headed off messengers and mail car
riers; all night the powerful search
light on the tug Timnilns played nerv
ously over th, waters to pick np
launches and to search the shores for
unwelcome watchers.
"Drivo them away quick." was the
shout from the Timmins to the police on
snore wnere toe searchlight revealed
newspaper "spies." "For heaven's
sake don't let them stay there."
. No Americana on Board.
A special delivery messenger arrived
at the eastern Forwarding dock with a
small package, presumably a gift from
an admirer to Captain Koenig.
"You can't come in here," saI3 the
German guard abruptly. "I won't take
that, package.".
The messenger was surprised.
"Will you write that down, or I'll
get in trouble," he replied.
And the guard wrote it, unmistakably
with the added Information that there
is no uso trying to deliver any packages
at the dock.
The inference from this generally is
that the Deutschland folk fear an at
tempt to wreck the ship.
The Deutschland, dressed up In fresh
grey paint, and decorated with traces
of white at the bow and stern, to re
semble the ocean waves, still lay at
the pier today. It had been announced
that Captain Koenig would go to New
York to see Ambassador Bernstorff and
bring back a package of diplomatic
mail, but Manager Hilken said this
afternoon: "The captain will stay
right here."
Captain Hinsch, mannger o'f transpor

Prediction
Washington. July 17. Villa is dead.
General Pershing's troops will be out
of Mexico within a month and the na
tional'' guard back home' within threw
months, a high war department official
said today.
Villa's name is being used by minor
ity leaders to inspire fear among Car
ranzistas, the official declared. He said,
Cnrranta was stronger today in Mexico
than he ever had been, principally be
cause he had averted war with the Unit
ed States "without loss of dignity by
exico."
Army men in touch with border and
Mexican interior conditions said today
there "isn't a chance in a thousand of
further trouble with Mexico," either by
a repetition of the Parral and Cnrriznl
inoidents, or by bandit raids.
Since the Carrizal attack was cleared;
up, and the last Carranza note received,
the war department has taken the view
that the Mexican trouble is over. Persh
ing's moviug his base north helped im
mensely, it was declared. Now rains
have come and threaten to necessitate)
further shortening of the lines.
"We expect Pershing to be out of
Mexico in a month or so,", said a, de

"The Carranza government was nev

of dignity to Mexico, be staved off war
with the United States. Villa himself
could not hurt him for that reason.
"And Villa, according to our reports,
is dead. We hear his nnme is used by
leaders to embarrass Carranza and to.
inspire fear in the Mexican people. We
think he is dead and his cause buried
with him."
