WASHINGTON. July 17. Villa is
dead. Pershing's column will be out of
Mexico w itliin a month and the Nation
al Guard will be demobilized and the
men all back in their homes within
thre month, was the statement a high
official made to the United Press today.
This official says that many minor
bandit leaders are using Villa's name
in their depredations to frighten the
Mexicans.
Carranza is Grouser than ever with
the Mexicans, says this official, be
cause he averted war with the United
States without loss of national dignity
The official als-o says that there is not
one chalice in a thousand for further
trouble between Mexico and the United
States cither by the repetition of the
Parral or Carrizal incidents or by
further border raids.
Since the Carrizal incident has been
patched up and since the last note to
Mexico, the trouble is over, he says.
General Pershing is moving his bae
now and preparing to leave Mexico,
according to this official.

both the Carranza and Villa forces are
marching toward the border. Mexicans
arriving here today say that their
train was held up by the Villa bandits

robbed of all their possessions. Mexi
cans returning to El Paso say that all

Former ('oliiradoaii Succumbs, to .Sud
den Stroll of Apoplexy.
.Mrs. Norah Stout, who lived with
her son-in-law. Priestly McCabe. at
Fairview and North Seventh streets
for the last three years, died sud
denly of apoplexy about 10 o'clock
last night.
Mrs. Stout xvas 31 years old and had
moved here from Colorado. Funeral
arrangements have not been made,
but the services probably will be held
at the Wilkes Boulevard Methodist
Church.
The fhmily had returned home and
had gone to bed yesterday evening,
xvhen Mrs. Stout called her daughter.
On going to the bedside, Mrs. McCabe
found her mother dangerously ill and
sent for a physician, but Mrs. Stout
died before the physician arrived.
Two daughters are left by Mrs.
Stout. Miss Elsie Stout and Mrs. Mc
Cabe. who at this time is iir a serious
condition from the shock, and two
sons now in Colorado.
The Columbia Iirowns kept it up

Dippold. as usual, distinguished
himself at the bat. He collected two

The Columbians are a bit inclined to
