RUSSIANS FIGHTING BESIDE FRENCH
AT THE FRONT IN CHAMPAGNE SECTOR
By FRED B. PITNEY.
(By Cable to Thc Tribune.)
Paris. July lf>.?One brief statement in the official
communique issued to-night took Paris by surprise and
caused much speculation in military circles.
"On the Champagne front there has been great ac?
tivity by Russian and French patrols," read the announce
ment.
Undoubtedly the Russian patrols mentioned formed
part of the Czar's forces landed at Marseilles early last
spring after a perilous trip from Vladivostok by way of
the Red .Sea. Not for months has there been any intima
tion as to the whereabouts of the Russians who nearly
circled the globe to light side by side with their allies in
the West.
Vague rumors have reached Paris from time to time
that these Russian troops were on their way to some part
of the French front, but to-night's statement is the first
authentic indication that they are actually supporting the
Allied lines.
That the Russians should have appeared suddenly in
Champagne is taken here to indicate either a sudden local
offensive by the French in that region or the transferring
of part of the French forces in Champagne to the threat
ened points at Verdun or on the Somme.

Lopp's Activities Cause
Separation of Field
Section.
By FRED B. IMTNEY.
[By CflMt t? Th* Trthun* ]
Paris, July 16. -The long expected
split in the American Ambulance at
NeuiUy has come. The field section.
under A. Piatt Andrew. has broken
away from Neuilly and established
itself in separate quarters, with sep
arate repair shops, parks and offices.
It even has its treasurer and its funds
unconnected with those of the Neu?
iUy Ambulance.
Official announeement of the separa- >
tion hns just been made. For a long
time there had been extremely un
plflaaaant conditions in the hospital, ow?
ing to the way in which George Wash?
ington Lopp had been allowed by
Laurence V. Renct, chairman of th"
(Xtcutiva committee, to dominate the
hospital affairs. After Lopp had
hoa'en his wife and stepdaughter, and
after his wife had sued him for di ,
vorce Andre**.'.-* frrends urged him ta
take the tield section away from the
hospital.
Opportunity for this action came
when Lopp and Benet were forced off
tha transportation committee of the
hospital, after the arrival on this side

'rarispor'ntion commi'tee being thus

Lor.don, July Iti.?Exhausted by
the desperate fighting of the last two
days, the German and British troopa
on the Somme are resting on th,*ir
arms to-night. In the lu'i which has
followed what correspondents at the
front describe as the fiercost fighting
of the war, the British are consoli
datir.g their r.ew positions north of
the Bazentin-Longueville line and
are bringing up their heavy artiilery
preparatory to resuming the great
drive toward Peronne.
After four assaults hurled in rapid
succession at the German lines in the
region of Ovillers and Bazentin-'.e
Petit this morning had faile.i to dis
lodge the enemy, operatiorrs on both
sides came to an abrupt halt.
dermans Surprise Foch.
On the Kreneh side of tho Somme
line the Germans this morninc- took
General Fooh by surprise. Powr-rful
attacks enabled thern to capture La
Maisonette and Biaches, but they
were ejected before they had time to
rally against the French counter at?
tack. The rapidity with which the
Germans were rolled back from these
two positions is hailed by military
experta as an indication af the tirm
grip the French have obtained on thi
newly won ground.
