Washington, July 17.—m response
to a request by Secretary Daniels for
an opinion of what lessons might be
drawn for the naval expansion pro
gram from the Jutland battle between
the British and German fleets. Rear
Admiral Knight of the naval war col
lege has replied that, far from die
crediting the battle cruiser, although
vessels of that type bore the brunt of
the losses in the engagement, the
fight added a new area to the field of
usefulness of the fast fighters.
The battle has not changed the ad
miral's opinion that dreadnoughts
are, and will continue to be, the back
bone of any fighting fleet, but it has
caused him to recommend that If con
gress decides to add only four capital
ships to the first line, all should be
battle cruisers.
"In my opinion," wrote the admiral
to the secretary, "neither Admiral
Jelllcoe's report nor any other source
of information at present available
affords a basis for definite judgment
as to the actual results of the battle
The most significant fact thus far es
tablished is that three British battle
cruisers were sunk. I was not clear
by what ships of the enemy fleet they
were sunk nor to how heavy a fire
they were subjected nor is it known
whether they were destroyed by gun
fire alone, or by the explosion of their
magazines.
"But this one fact is clear, and In it
lies the whole explanation of the In
cident—tho battle cruisers were doing
the work of battleships for which they
were not designed and they paid a
penalty which was more or less in
evitable. -They were not only engag
ing battleships but they were engag
ing them at short range- It Is claimed

Glacier Park Limited and

Meet Head-on.
LOCAL DID NOT

Crash Came Within Few
Feet of Safety Zone—One
Engine Demolished.
(Herald Special Service.)
Wllliston, N. D., July 17.—The
Glacier Park limited and the Wlllls
ton-Glasgow local passenger trains of
the Great Northern collided head-on
12 miles west of Wllliston at 7 o'clock
this morning, injuring several, but
with no fatalities resulting. Over 200
passengers were aboard the two trains.
The local train, ordered onto the
siding at Todd, failed to reach the
safety zone before the Glazier Park
limited reached the scene, the crash
taking place about 30 feet east of the
switch in the Todd yards-
One locomotive of the local train,
which was being double-headed, was
completely demolished under the
driving force of the express train,
but the engine crew had leaped to
safety.
When the crash occurred, the pas
sengers in the two trains were thrown
about promiscuously. There was a
rush of escaping steam, and In the ter
rible din, a near panic prevailed.
The most seriously Injured include
Mrs. C. M. Graves, Portland, Ore.,
who was thrown-through a glass door
and badly cut up.
Joe Cutting, former twin city foot
ball player, manager of the Wllliston
baseball team, reoelved a sprained
wrist, and Eugene Bruegger of Willis

being thrown into a glass door, which
crashed.

that they were doing this for a pur

Beeking to hold the enemy fleet until
Admiral Jellicoe could come up and
that they accomplished this."
Admiral Jellicoe claims that, as a
•direct result of Admiral Beatty's ac
tion, the British grand fleet was en
abled to engage the enemy fleet and
would have destroyed It, but for the
fact that thick weather set in and
made it impossible to maintain con
tact.
"Had the success which Admiral
Jellicoe claims to have had almost
within his grasp, been actually at
tained. It would have been entirely
due to the battle cruisers and the loss
of three of these would have been a
small price to pay for such a result.
In other words, the battle off Jutland,
so far from discrediting the battle
cruiser, has added a new area to Its
possible field of usefulness, and we
may now say of It that in addition to
its use for seoutlng-and screening and
for operating as a fast wing against
the flanks of an enemy fleet, it may be
used fOr 'holding' an enemy fleet until
our own fleet can oome up. That It
may be subject to heavy losses in ac
complishing this task, does not make
the task less useful or less brilliant.
"My reply is, then, that my view
of the value of the battle cruiser has
been somewhat enhanced by the re
sults of the battle off Jutland so far
as these results are known."
At this point, the admiral referred
to his testimony before the house
