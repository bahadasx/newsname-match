have completed this piece of legisla
tion which I hope will be immensely
beneficial to the farmers of the coun
try. ' .The farmers, it seems to me,
have occupied hitherto a singular po
sition of disadvantages. They have
not had the same freedom to get
credit on their real estate that others
have had who were in manufacturing
and commercial enterprises and while
they have sustained our life v they
should with some others share , the
benefits of life. . ,
"Therefore, this bill, along with
the very liberal provisions of the fed
eral reserve act puts them on an
equality with all others who have
genuine assets and makes the great
credit of the country ' available to
them."
The President used two pens in
signing the bill and gave one of them
to Senator Fletcher, of .Florida, who
asked permission to present it to the

TROLLEYS CRUSH
JITNEY TO BITS;
PASSENGERS SAFE
- . ,
- : , " i .
Reckless; Driver Tries to
Dart Between Two Heavy
Street Cars.
The lives of six passengers In a Jit
ney bus were endansered this morn
ing by the driver's mad desire to get
ahead of a trolley car and the Jitney
bus was crushed to pieces,, though the
passengers by almost a miracle escap
ed harm. . The driver, Benjamin Sacks
of 44 Highland avenue, was arrested,
charged with reckless driving. His
machine was wrecked beyond repair.
Sacks was driving his machine west
on Stratford - avenue i about 7:80
o'clock and at the east crossing of East
Main street' trolley car No. 231 was
stopped, taking on and i discharging
passengers. In Sacks' bus were four
girls and two men and as he endeav
ored to make faster tiro in getting to
the center ' of the city he - turned to
the left of the standing trolley. , A car
bound for Avon park was on the op
posite side of the street, but was under
headway travelling east -
Undaunted - by tne fact . that tils
chances of getting ahead Kot the west
bound car without a collision with
the east bound trolley were slim.
Sacks put on more speed to get be
tween the trams. Seeing the danger
that confronted the passengers in the
Jitney bus, Motorman Herbert Shlpple
of 794 Iiafayette street, of the Avon
park oar, applied the brakes but his
efforts were -of no use.
The girls in the Jitney bus screamed
as they saw the ' chance Sacks was
taking and passengers on both cars,
which .were loaded, attracted by the
screams and Sacks' recklessness. Jump
ed up in their seats and yelled at him,
but his only chance was to make, an
effort to get clear of the fenders of
both cars. ' ,
: Women on the cars screamed and
several nearly fainted when they heard
the crash as the Jitney bus was
caught sideways between the two ears
and crumpled like paper. How the
passengers escaped WJury was beyond
the knowledge of those who witnessed,
the near fatality and Sacks was cen
sured severely for his fool hardiness in
taking the -chance. "
As soon as the machine was wedged
between the cars, the passengers on
it left the wrecked bue and disappear-
ed in the crowd before .their names
could be secured by Policeman C. A.
Clark, whe appeared and placed Sacks
under arrest But one of the men In
the Jitney car eould be located and he
is Albert C. Kllbuck of 207 Central
avenue.
The motorman on the trolley which
was standing at the northeast corner
of the streets, was John Barry and the
conductor, Edward Larrie. The con
ductor on "the other trolley was Tim
