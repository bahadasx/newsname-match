UNION CHARGES 'DOUBLE CROSS'
VILLA OFFICIALLY DEAD
DEATH TRAPS! I
SIX OF THEM!
Six death traps that will take their toll of
human life every month until they are abol
ished —that is what six grade crossings on j
the Tacoma Sumner paved highway amount |
to. !
Every day hundreds of autos traverse
tliis road, which also is the chief route to Se
attle, and their number probably never will
decrease. ■
Every day scores of wagonloads of pro
duce trundle over that road to market.
Every day dozens of interurhan and steam
trains clash alone their iteel rights-of-way,
intersecting at high speed the pavement on
which the vehicle traffic of a teeming valley
rolls. And the number of these trains is
multiplying. -^
Yesterday's catastrophe iii which ilireo
persons lost their lives chanced not to lake
place along this main highway, hut on a
branch road three hlocks away. No matter,
the lesson is the same. 11 is just one of a
series of such accidents that nave shocked
the state within recent months.
Six grade crossings in 10 miles! Three
Milwaukee railroad crossings and three in- >
terurbati crossings! And the worst of it is i
that at some of these danger points 1 he rail
ways fairly sneak out of the clustered farm
houses and trees to bewilder and harass the
drh-ers. |
Six death traps in 10 miles! In all the rest
of the drive to Seattle there is but one such
crossing. And here, on one of our most im
portant thoroughfares, are SIX!
It is too late now to berate those respon
sible for the condition, but it is not too late
to begin seeking a remedy.
Death traps, that is what these crossings
are. ANDTHKY ALWAYS WILL HE
DEATH TRAPS UNTIL THEY ARE
ABOLISHED.
PAVLOWA, SHE OF $5
SEATS, COMES BACK
AS A MOVIE STAR
BY FRKDIHK FII-M.
Anna Pavlowa and her Im
perial Ballet Kusse appeared hi
the Tacoma theater some few
months ago, and we felt a resent
ment against the brilliant artisi
because we didn't have the neces
sary $2 or $5 to plank down tor
a ticket.
Why should one who is gifted
by the godß hold herself .iloof
from us, we "common people?"
Why should such treats be :e
--served only for those whose pock
ets are lined with wealth?
We knew that Anna Pavlowa
wasn't to blame for the prices,
but just the name we coul.lu't
down that feeling of dissatisfac
tion.
We wanted to see Anna, Oh, so
much! Yet we could not.
• » •
But tlie world's premier dan
seuse has not failed you and me
and the rest of us commoners of
grand opera tastes and ;iio/ie
purses.
She Is here at the Apollo at
slightly Increased prices.
Through the medium of a tiny
celluloid ribbon, she has come to
us. We can see her dance as
she has danced for kings and plu
tocrats. We can see the Russian
ballet In the same dances that
caused Czarevlch Nicholas to
weep and applaud.
And yhat Is more —something
t*x< *.* friends at the Tacoma
UMT>w»> *>aye not yet enjoyed—we
can see Anna Pavlowa in a n<>w
ro ] that of a talented mo
tional actress.

Anna Pavlowa. as Fenella, won
the sympathy and admiration of
every person in the big Apollo
audiences last night.
Her dances on the sandy beach,
before she had become enamored
of Alphonso, were a wonder and
a delight.
The Russian ballet, dancing for
the tyrranlcal viceroy and his re
gal court, was superb.
The battle scenes were the
greatest ever filmed, I think.
In eight reels of pictures, In
which are more than 900 costly
scenes, she proved that we were
wrong In resenting our exclusion
from the expensive seats at the
Tacoma theater.
Mme. Pavlowa Is surrounded,
In "The Dumb Girl of l'ortlcl,'" oy
a company of film stars that
would uhlne brilliantly on any
other screen.
But it is HER picture, and she
put every ounce of ability And
art Into making thin production
for the masses a success.
Long live Anna Pavlowa!

Himself
H. F. Norris, Taooma attorney
against whom disbarment pro
j ceedlngs were recently brought,
| today was granted permission by
' the superior court to withdraw
from practice, and the case was
dropped.
In his petition asking that he
be allowed to withdraw and be
disbarred, Xorris said that while
he "folly believed the charges
filed againSl him were not suffi
cient to warrant any action
against him and that there was
no just cause for his disbarment,
onjfecount of the condition of his
hSalth and the effect of the worry
of contending the action further,
he feels It due to his family and,
for the best interest of himself to
cease the practice of his profes
sion altogether.
Judge Clifford ordered his
name stricken from the role of
attorneys.
U. S. Will
Take Over
Railways
ST. LOUIS, July 17.—Declar
ing that the government Is better '
prepared than ever before to
operate railroads, J. J. Keegan of
the department of labor today
predicted that the government
would take over the roads should
the four railroad brotherhoods
call a strike.
If the government takes the
roads, the men will resume work
immediately, said Keegan.
The government recognizes i
the eight-hour day, one of the '
points of contention in tlie pres
ent controversy. i
.Ke refused to say that any '
plans have been formulated to '
take over the roaas, but declared i
the step could not be avoided If
the men leave their puts. It is >
practically certain the brother
hoods will vote to strike.
A compromise is probable, he i
said, but should a break occur '
the government would act within
a few hours and seize the rail- :
roads, never again to return them '
to private ownership. <
