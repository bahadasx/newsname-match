KOENIG SUSPENDS RULES
An InCrease In the naval bill that will
provide for additional *ubmarines, may
follow the visit to Baltimore yesterday of
Vice President Marshall and Senators
Chamberlain and Vardaman. who Inspect
ed the Deutschland at her pier.
The visit was pauticularly sgnifeint
because the naval bill Is now being de
bated In the Senate, and because of Ben
ator Chamberlain's prominence In army
and navy legislation as chairman of the
Senate Committee on Military Affairs.
While strict orders had been tseued to
permit no Americans on board. the ban
was lifted to allow the government of
Mctets to inspect the big submersible and
the officers showed them every courtesy.
Up to the time the Deutschland was
reported off Newport News, marking the
completion of the firs trans-Atlantic
journey for a submarine. there was great
doubt among members of Congress as to
the ability of submersibles to journey so
far ffom a naval base.
The success of the Teuton U-boat puta
a different complexion on the ability of
the submarine and may cause more Jib
erality in the matter of appropriations
for boats of this type.
Senator Vardaman said last night that
the visit was for pleasure and educational
purposes. so far as his presence was con
cerned. In the Senatorial party were Mr.
and Mrs. Macy Dinkins, of Mi.sissippi.
and Mrs. Caroline Shelton, of Washing

Mr. Hughes was strengthened in this

"I assured Mr. Hughes that the New
