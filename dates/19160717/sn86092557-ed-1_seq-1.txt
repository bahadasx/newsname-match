Mayor and Heads of Two Commercial Organizations
Agree That Something Should Be Dona

Earlier Attempt to Maintain Service Was a Failure Main
ly Because It Cost Too Much to Operate

The danger of the abandonment by
Bjthe Unltod States Government of the
attempt to keop open the Monongahe
la river navigation, emphasized by tho
recent visit of Colonel Jadwln. of tho
jtr.' 6. Engineers, has caused consid
erable diacu8Bion of the problem
among local business men. The fact
fv that unless immediate steps are taken j
by representative citizens of the
twons along the upper Monongahela
river toward a revival of river trans
portation and an Increase in river
traffic, the government may discontin
ue the expensive service now main
tained at the various locks, has gtvuu
aded Impetus to a speedy considera
tion of the river traffic problem aim
present indications are that some ac- j
tlon will be taken on the matter by
local organizations.
The suggestion that the Board of
Affairs and the Chamber of Commerce !
together with the Busluess Men's As- 1
soclatlon should Invite Col. Jadwin to j
, Fairmont and address a meeting of j
the public spirited citizens so that :i
definite plan of concerted action can
be evolved has met with the approval j
of the officials of those bodies.
President H. J. Roes, of the Cham
Mber of Commerce, speaking of the prop
osltlon today said , "The Chamber of I
Commerce will gladly co-operate with J
the Board of Affairs in inviting Col.
Jadwln to discuss tho situation ai
Fairmont and I think that immediate <
>).' steps in regard to the problem should |
be taken. Col. Jadwln probably knows
more about river transportation than
any one person we could bring here.
While I have but little faith in largo
meetings as productive of results, yet
erfaaps that way might be the best
r'the selection of a few men who
could act as a commission to Jnvestl
SEVENTH STREET
Opening of New Normal
Will Increase Traffic on
That Thoroughfare.
R. J. Ross and cithers appeared
with a petition before the Hoard ot
Affairs In session this morning aud j
asked that Seventh street and Oak
wood road be paved from Loop Park
to Locust avenue. This request is
made on account of the location or
the new Normal school building bring*
lng several hundred additional pedes
trians along that route to the school.
The matter was referred to Street
Commissioner Lehman and Finance
Commissioner Barnes for Investiga
tion and proper action.
; Water and Sewer Commissioner Ira
L. Smith was permitted to purchase a
new water intake pipe for the pump
station. He was also instructed to
buy several water pressure regula
tors for trial use to be placed at points
where the water pressure is high.
Several minor requests for exten- |
sions of sewers were takon under con.
slderation but nothing was passed j
OQattJ,
' .The meeting was continued until j
three o'clock this afternoon when
building permits and licenses were
taken up.

TWO PEOPLE INJURED
53jMr. Whistler of Burton, while sharp
ening a sythe, accidentally cut an ar- ]
tery In his wrist Saturday evening, j
""ir. Leahy of Mannlngton, dressod his j
juries.
I Miss Clara CUnix was burned about I
the face and neclc tbb morning when i
(?lit the fire in rf gag oven. Dr

gate and devise ways and moans for
; actual improvement In river traffic. I
i have talked with a number of the mora
hers who were Interested in tho for
mer freight scheme, ami although a!l
of them, including mysolf. lout money
on the proposition, yet wo are willing
to try It again, and profit by our ex
perience.
"Tho chief causo of our failure be
fore was the too high coat of operat
ing our packet If the propor kind of
gasoline or oil burning boat can be se
cured a large amount of local freight
! from jobbers in Pittsburg would be car
ried and with the co-operation of the
other towns along the valley the ven
ture would he profitable to every one
interested."
Mayor Bowon. speaking on behalf
of the Board of Affairs stated that they
would willingly co-operate in any way
in order to bring about some improve
ment in river conditions. "Col. Jad
wln is an authority on this sort ot
problem." said the Mayor, "and I feel
that if he had an opportunity of tell
ing tho people of the community what
vast Importance tho river is to us anrt
fully explain the benefits that could
be derived by the whole comunlty by
the f'lll use of the water for transpor
tation of freight that a great amount
of good would result."
J. L. Hall, president of the Business
Mon's association, is of the opinion
that a meeting of the cltizons address
ed by Col. Jadwln, would be the best
method of reviving interest in tho rlv
er transportation problem and that at
such a meeting definite plans for over
coming the difficulties could bo made.
According to Mr. Hall "the meeting
would coat us nothing except our time !
in bolng present and may be tho moans
of revolutionising our freight condi
tions."

So soon as news of Judge Moss'

Moore, to be in charge.

City and at Parkersburg over the

the body would pass through Wash

According to the prediction of the
members of the Board of Review and
Equalization who today completed
task of examining tho books of the
assessor tho county tax levy for tho
fiscal year ending next July will be
considerably lower than it was the

regard to the assessment, for the next
two weeks until the required 25 days
