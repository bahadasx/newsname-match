bo .out of Mexico within a month

within three months, a high War
Department olllclal said to-day.
Villa's name Is being used by minor
leaders to Inspire fear among Car

said Carranza wns stronger to-day In
Mexico than he over had been, prin
cipally becauso he had averted war
with the United Slot's "without loss
of dignity by Mexico."
"Wo expect I'ershlng to be out of
Mexico In a month or so," said a
Department olllclal to-day. "In threo
months the National Guard probably
will bo back home.
"The Carranza Government was
nevor stronger than It Is. Sentiment
has crystallised behind him since tho
recent trouble. This Is becauso,
without loss of dignity to Mexico, ho
staved off war with the United States.
Villa himself couldn't hurt him for
that reason.
"And Villa, according to our re
ports, Is dead. We believe ms namo
Is being used by his leaders to em
barrass Carranza and to Inspire fear
In the Mexican people. Wo think he
Is dead and his causo burled with
him."

and Incursions Into American terri
tory, but Is in a position to subdue
the bandts completely and pacify the

"It, Is our purpose to give protec.
