Texas Tate Explains How Impression Went
Out About Fifteen Round Affair and
Confident of Victory
Intense interest in tho advertised
limit between Texas Tato and the, Pu
eblo fireman was unstained through
out Sunday and Monday and the next
move of the county attorney is being
looked to not only by those who are
direetly connected with the coming
boxing exhibition but by hundreds
who exp?:t, to witness it If no inter
ference results.
"Whether or not an injunction will
iie issued against the principal and
promoters, of the fight which is sche
duled to take place on Ju!,- l'.'i will
depend on the district judge," declar
ed County Attorney Venable to an Ex
press man this morning. "1 shall ask
for an injunction some day this week
to prevent the mill but will not an
nounce the date, at this time."
A number of prominent citizens are
said to have asked the county attor
ney to recede from his step but no at
tention Mill be paid to their pleas.
"An officer cannot afford to be sway
ed by the persuasions of other people
in a case of" this kind." said Mr. Vena
ble. "As soon as they learn that he
e susceptible to that there would be
in) end to their solicitations.".
Mayor Approves Contest.
Among the most outspoken advo
cates of non-interference with the
Tate-Flynn meet on July L'." is Mayor
Coffman.
"Understand me clearly when i say
that I am opposed to prize fights," he
said today, "just, us I am opposed to
any other illegal act or proceeding,
tint this is not a prize fight it is a
hoxiuir exhibition, one which, will be b
of great public interest and is on the
same order as those boxing contests
which are encouraged in our public
schools.,1 It is the same with baseball
iu.d n gjiod horse race. 1 enjoy them.
1 go and shout for the winner and for
good points in the game but I would
not bet a red cent on anytning that
ever came up. You hear me talk of
'betting sometimes, hut 1 u' ... the
phrase more in the shape of slang. I
would not bet on anything. But these
sports have a healthy fascination for
me. and 1 know they appeal to many
other people in ChkkaHia so long as
ttiey are conducted strictly within the
law as I have every reason to bel eve
this exhibition will be.
"I was one of those, citizens who
went to the county attorney on Satur
day and asked him to reconsider the
case, as it was within the law, a box
ing exhibition with r, or., gloves, if
it were, to take place within the city
limits, i should not only not oppose it
but I should help get it through."
"I believe in the enforcement of the
law." asserted the mayor in conclusion,
"but I believe that the county attor
ney is going too far in this matter."
Texas Tate Talks.
"The S'ar was in grave error when
it referred to the boxing exhibition as

this morning. "This is no fight, it is
