1exlnnton, Ky.. July 17 It was a
silent crowd of fans who trooped out
of the grandstand and bleachers at
IjCAkiio Park yi'tderday afternoon af
ter the game was over. For word had
been passed around that the Sunday
game waa to be the last, and the
march to the carllne waa more of a
funeral procession than anything elae.
While the game waa still In prog
ress, Secretary Hogan Yancey sent a
telegram to League President Joe Carr
at Columbua, Ohio, Informing him
that the game would be the laat play
ed by Lexington and asking for In
structions as to what should be done
with the playera. No answer had been
received to the message at a late hour
last night. However, It is supposed
that whatever city takes the place of
Lexington will also take over the
players who have not been sold by the
local management. It is possible that
(..exlngton's desertion may mean the
end of the Ohio State League, al
though there is nothing definite in re
gard to thla.
Ralph Shafer will leave today for
Terre Haute and McClelland will also
leave the city within the next two
days. A deal with the Louisville Amer
ican Association club for pitcher Ror
er la also under way and may be com
pleted within the next twenty-four
hourB. However, the Lexington fran
chlae was the property of all that re
mains of the once famous Ohio State
League at 12 o'clock last night, and
Lexington aa an organized ball town
haa become a sad memory. It is im
probable that this city will ever again
have another franchise from the Ohio
State League. There are not enough
real, dyed-in-the-wool, thirty-third de
gree fans In this city to keep either a
good team or a bad one going.

duties were many she was never too
busy to look after her home and chil

a good neighbor and a splendid woman

Issued a proclamation and warning
to the County Boards and Municipali
ties throughout the State calling at
tention to the fact that Infantile Para
lysis, now epidemic in many of our
large rcltles, Is spreading throughout
the entire land. The cause of this
most dreaded disease, In the opinion
of the best medical authorities, Is filth
and lack of sanitation. And, while the
disease Is usually confined to Infants
and small children, adults are by no
means Immune to It.
Because of the conditions that now
confront us we are making this urgent
appeal to every citizen of this city who
values the health, the life and happi
ness of the people of this community
to co-operate with the County and Clf
Boards of Health, the Health league
and the Woman's Club and, especially
do we ask the Chamber of Commerce
for their assistance and co-operation
In this very serious matter. On ac
count of the above conditions we deem
It prudent and do hereby Issue the fol
lowing proclamation:

Mr. flarrett B. Wall or the C. ft O.
Railroad was in this city Saturday
Bnd had with him the drawings of the
new depot which will be built here at
some future date by the C. ft O. Rail
road. The plans were left In the May
or's office.
The plans aa shown call for a fifty
thousand dollar brick depot to be built
en the site of the present freight de
pot. This will necessltste the closing
of lxwer street and filling the same to
the level of the lot of Mr. E. T. Kirk
There will be three waiting rooms,
one for the white ladies, one for white
gentlemen and one for the colored
people. There will also be a baggage
room connected with the depot. With
the depot will also be built track sheds
for protection in bad weather. The
present freight depot will be removed
to the site of the paasenger depot.
The passenger depot will be on the
order of the depot now in use in
Ronceverte, W. Va.
About the only obstacle In the way
is the closing of Lower street and as
several of the Councilmen oppose this
It is not known whether or not the
tnatter would pass if brought to a
vote. The street is never used except
as a passage way by a few people. It
has not been used as a street for a
great number of years. It la crafmett
that with the completion of the great
Ixiek and Dam system on the Ohio
which will mean a nine foot stage at
low water mark, that there will be a
revival in the boating trade and every
outlet to the river will be greatly
needed. That will he a great many
yeara however. The landing at Lower
street Is not practicable on accrunt of
the awlft current at this place.
It remains with the City Council to
determine whether or not thla thlnR
will be granted the C. ft O. The rail
road is willing to do their part so why
not the city?
