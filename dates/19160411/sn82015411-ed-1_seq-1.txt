GOVERNOR ADDRESSES
CHAMBER OE COMMERCE
Governor Pinkham appeared be
fore the Chamber of Commerce, at
1 o'clock tl lis afternoon and deliver
ed the following address:
Meiuebers of the Kauai Cham
ber of Commerce
It is a gratification to me to meet
you and briefly express my views
and review my actions in matters
that concern your island. I am
not a stranger to your needs, one
of the greatest of which I have
considered to be a safe protected
harbor and the direct landing and
embarking of passengers and of
handling of freight.
Nawiliwili seems to be the most
central aim available port and so
considered by United States en
gineers. Unless you can show an ade
quate amount of business to justi
fy the necessary expenditure, I
doubt if the Congress of the Unit
ed States will ever vote the sum
requited, no matter how much you
press it with petitions.
During the past two years I
have tried to secure harmony and
cooperation of every interest on
this side of the island to combine
all existing patronage and increase
to the greatest possible extent, fu
ture business for a port at Nawili
wili. Mu nrlmitiistrniinn li a s taken
great interest in this project. It
can do little more until vou make
it possible tv complete coopera
tion among yourselves for the gov
ernment, to present indisputable
economic facts to congress.
The ptoblem of homesteading
government lauds on Kauai has
been a perplexing one to every ad
ministration that has had to do
with it.
All the large interests in the
Territory have been built up on
an unparalelled paternalism, and
have insisted upon it as a right.
The smaller interests are now
insisting o n certain inalienable
rights and paternalism. There is
a conflict between unexpired pri
vileges granted heretofore on long
terms by the government to large
interests and the needs of the
homesteader who is, and is becom
ing, but the mandates of the Or
gantic Act, which cannot be set
aside, the owner of the public
lauds. He is coming into posses
sion of valuable lauds and im
provements not altogether on a
altogether carving out an agricul
tural home and business; lie is ap
propriating what has reverted to
the government. This does not
satisfy him because his needs go
beyond what the government pos
sesses, or has the means to supply.
He is impatient. Larger interests,
some of them, are reluctant to sur
render all or part of their well
development successful enterprises
and part with the factors essen-
tial to their business and profit.
The government has a perplexing
duty to perforin.
Nearly two years ago Land Com
missioner J. D. Tucker, who has
been quite and at times danger
ously Jll. during the past vear,
Mr. Albert Horner and myself,
visited the lands of Kapaa, Kealia,
Olehina, Waipouli, Anahola, etc,
and were most courteously enter
tained for two days by Col. Z. S.
Spalding, and every facility neces
sary for us to comprehend the
situation in these localities was
kindly and gratuitously supplied.
The needs of the adjacent home
steaders and the possible extension
of homestead areas were consider-
ed and most particularly enlarged
upon by Mr. Horner, whose des
cription of the topography of the
upper lands I depended upon, and
his assertions as to the possible
transortation on the mauka lands,
later to be returned to the govern
ment control, were given credence.
Reasonableaud practicable trans
portation for all lands hotnestead
ed. existed or had been planned
by Jthe previous governor. Mr.
Horner failed to tell me of the ob
stacles to tnauka railway construc
tion. Possibly he had not realized
them, but was enthusiastic over
the possibilities o f contributing
from mauka lands a ftipport for
the Nawiliwili port.
He himself lacked definite ideas
as to where he desired to locate
his proposed pineapple cannery.
During this visit I never once
heard Col. Spalding speak ill of
anyone, or exhibit any reluctance
in surrendering any land or im
provements that by law or agree
ment reverted from his plantation
to the government.
He realized, as does any person
of ordinary percept;on, that the
homesteader in this Territory in
no respect is situated as is the
mainland temperate climate home
steader. The homesteader in Ha
waii must have the most exacting
paternal care, both in providing
him with money, labor, imple
ments, water, and transportation
until in effect the homesteader be

obliged to work his way alone
from the start, entirely on his own
responsibility, and with little as
sistance even on the public high-
wavs.
The government has neither the
authority or Jmeans to assist the
homesteader to the extent his in
terests require, kence is obliged to
abandon the;homesteader or seek
to secure for him the private sup
port necessary to supply those de
ficiencies beyond its control.
It was about the middle or last
of October before the homesteaders
had aligned themselues so the gov
ernment had anj idea of what they
definitelv desired, and even then
were divided into four groups,
which constantly shifted and ap
parcntiy precluded any economic,
comprehensive solution of the vari
ous factors necessary to their suc
cess.
Circumstances w;ell known fore
ed a delay which was not unfavor
able to the homesteader.
At the earliest possible day the

NATION A
GOVERNOR PINKHAM SEES
MUCH OF HOMESTEADING
Governor Pinkham and party
arrived at Nawiliwili it: flic Maui
about 4 o'clock Friday morning.
With the Governor were Chas.R.
Forbes, superintendent of public
works; B. Rivenbnrgh, laud com
missioner; A ttorney-General iitain
back, Forester Judd, Water Survey
or Larrison, Civil Engineer Furer
and clerical attaches. On the boat,
arriving in connection with the
same business, were Judge Arthur
Wilder, Albert Horner and H. P.
O'Sullivan, while the newspaper
men in thepartv were R.O. Mathe-
son, editor of the Advertiser: J.
F. Stone, representing the Star
Bulletin, and M. G. Santos, of O'
Luso.
The Governor was met at the
wharf by a partv of field officers
of the Fourth Regiment, N. G. H., j
consisting of Colonel E. H. W,
Broadbent, Lt. Colonel Timmous
and Major F. L. Ptitman.
From the landing the Governor's i
party was taken to the Fairview
hotel where coffee was in waiting,
preparatory to the long ride across
the island to Waimea. The party
got away about daylight, reaching
Waimea in time for a seasonable
breakfast, after which the Govern
or enjoyed a short rest.
Superintendent Forbes, in the
meanwhile, acting for the -public
utilities commission, held an in
vestigation into the electric light
plant being run bv W. O. Crowell,
and which supp'ies light to Wai
mea. The commission decided that
this plant came under its jurisdic
tion and directed that it nay the
usual fees. !
Then the party drove out to thej
Bark:ng Sands, took
a look and!
returned to Kekaha.

Completed plans and specifica
tions for the proposed Lihue Ar
mory were received here last week
and, as may be seen in another
column of this paper, sealed tend
ers are now being called tor bv the
Buildings Committee. In view of
the fact that there will probably ,
be more contractors from Hono-i
lulu to bid on this work than fromj
Kauai, it was thought advisable!
to open bids in Honolulu.
Chas. R. Forbes, Superinten
of Public Works in whose office
the plans were proposed has offer
ed to act as agent for the local
buildings committee in receiving
and tabulating t h e bids. Final
award of contract will, of course,
be made by the buildirg commit
tee. Bids will be opened in Hono
lulu next Monday morning, April
17, at 11 o'clock and it is to be
noted in this connection that bids
from Kauai contractors in order
to reach their destination before
the above date, will have to leave
here on Saturday, April 15th,
It is not anticipated that the
complete plans can be carried out
for the amount which has been
subscribed and to that end the pro
posals have beeh arranged so as to
contain a number of ' items" and
the first item, for instance, calls
for a figure on the building com
plete; the second item is the same
as the first but for the omission
of certain partitions, lavatories,
etc., in the basemsnt; the third
item is the same as the second but
TENDER
CALLED
FOR NEW ARMORY
ter place the Governor took up
with Manager Faye the subject of
mill site and other leases which will
shortly expire. Mr. Faye strted
to the Governor what the planta
tion would probably be willing to
do and the matter was taken tinder
consideration.
The Governor, Mr. Larrison and
Mr. W. V. Hardy then went up
WTaimea canyon to examine cer
tain water sources theie. On the
way back the car In which the
Governor was riding stuck in the
mud, the wheels began suddenly
to revolve at a terrifn: pace and in
a moment the executive face war,
bespattered with mud. "I have an
example of Kauai mud slinging,"
observed the Governor after the
journey had again been resumed.
The party had luncheon and a
good rest at Waimea after which
the return was made slowly to Li
hue. To a crowd of some 200 people
from the homestead districts, Gov
ernor Pinkham spoke briefly on
Saturday morning, ai Kapaa school
his remarks preceding the invita
tion to the homesteaders to come
up in person and talk with him
and the other territorial represen
tatives. The governor declared that he
had not intended to make any talk
at all. but that wholly unjustified
communications to the press re
garding him had led him to do so
at last. He said his fust wish was
to find out what the people want
ed. He had never been moved to
do things through the influence of
nionied powers when against the
right, a d fear was a thing he had
ne'-er yet experienced.
