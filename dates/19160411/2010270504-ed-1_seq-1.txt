Since the 18lh day of January, the date that this com
pany voted to move its Home Office to North Platte frdm
Lexington, and the date that we went on a legal reserve basis
we have moved all the belongings of the former Fidelity Life
Association to North Platte, and on account of the changing
of our name and form of insurance, we have had printed an
entire new set of blanks, such as Policies, Applications and
every other form that an insurance company needs.
We have spent about $1200.00 in fixing up a modern,
up-to-date insurance olfice, and we are just abmt ready to
commence our active campaign over the state for new insur
ance. Without any push at all from the home office, as the
officers had all they could handle in the removal and
reorganization, this company has put on the books $70,00.00
of insurance since the 18th day of January of. .this year.
Last week the President of the Company, Dr. Bak'tir; was in
Sidney! and Kimball and wrote $30,000.00 of nqWi business.
This shows the selling qualities of our policies. ,
We want ' practically every insurable person .'in North
Platte and Vicinty to carry a policy in this company. We
give you the best insurance for the premium of a'Hy1 company
doing business in Nebraska today. We will scjlj. it to you
on an annual, semi-annual, quarterly or monthly basis. Any
terms that are convient to you, and every dollar' you invest
with this company, will help buildup North PlatUj.a.ud West
ern Nebraska and not New York, Philadelphia or other east
ern city that you are not interested in. , .
Phone the office for an appointment and one of our
agents will call on you and explain our policy. You are
