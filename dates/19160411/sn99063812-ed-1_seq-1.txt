Organization Plan
in the Work of
County Agents
The plait for organisation of coun
ty agent work in Orogon differs from
the usual farm bureau plan In that
the connty agent uses existing organ
izations Instoad of forming now or
ganisations. Tbo Oregon plau Is out
lined bv Paul V. Marls, state leader of
farm demonstration work, as follows.
Knelt organisation within a county
that bus for Its purpose tho promotion
of agricultural Interests, Is permitted
to scloct from Its membership a rep
resentative to a body to be known as
tho County Agricultural
Council. Tho bonrd of county commis
sioners Is also otttltlod to elect one
member to tho council.
This type of organization relievos
tho agont of tho responsibility of
tualntalnlng n now organization. In
tho usual form of organization tho
county agent assumes responsibility
both for tho creating and maintaining
o'f the organizations that support hla
work.
