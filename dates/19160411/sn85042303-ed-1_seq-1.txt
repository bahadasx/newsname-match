The Ardmore Business Men's Asso
ciation can well afford to be proud at
its first effort to give this city a
floral parade. The magnificent spec
tacle that passed through the prin
cipal streets of the city yesterday af
ternoon, paid eloquent tribute to the
genius and hustle of Secretary-Walter
Gilbert, anti the membCTs'rfWffrs
sociation. 8ixty-Fivs Decorated Cars.
Sixty-five decorated cars were in the
line of march, besides there were
many others who failed to put on the
tinsel and bunting, but just wanted to
be with the live ones, and the thou
sands who lined the sidewalks during
the parade showered rounds of ap
plause as their favorites passed by.
The parade was formed at Central
park by V. C. Suggs who led it in a
tiny Saxon, the official car, over the
advertised route, past the judges'
stand and back to the starting point,
in the following order:
The Afternoon Parade.
Sheriff Garrett, mounted on a mag
nificent white horse, gaily caparisoned.
The Fifth Artillery Band in two auto
trucks, Chief of Tolice illutchin3 and
the members of the police department,
the city fire department, and the mem
bers of the school board.
Interspersed between the decorated
cars were the members of the Fresh
man, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior
classes of the Ardmore high school.
The band from the Wortham Carnival
company, now playing in this city,
brought up the rear of the parade up
on a large float drawn by four white
horses; this band as well as the artil
lery band which preceded it, came in
for rounds of generous applause.
Night Parade.
The auto parade last night was even
superior to the one of the afternoon,
the cars all came back, with electric
lights added to the decorations worn
during the day parade, and preseuted
a magnificent spectacle as they passed
through the streets. The route travers
ed Mas the same as in the afternoon.
After the parade was over, the crowd
which was estimated to be one of the
largest ever assembled in this city on
any occasion, surged to the corner of
West Main and C street, where the

TRIBUTE TO
E
CLARENCE WORTHAM, PROPRIE
TOR OF WORTHAM SHOWS,
SURPRISED AT THE SPIRIT DIS
PLAYED. Clarence A. Wortham, owner of the
Great Wortham shows, which are
hero furnishing the attractions for
the big spring festival which Is being
held under the auspices of the Com
mercial Club, was in Ardmore yes
terday and during his visit here paid
a pretty tribute to the progressive
ness of the city, all of which was
overheard by The Ardmorelte man,
who happened to be standing near
when Mr. Wortham, who was in con
versation with Walter Stanley, man
ager of the Great Wortham Shows,
said: "Gee, but this is a wonderful
little city. It has surprised me. It
reminds me strongly of the oil towns
of Ohio during the boom there some
years ago, and after playing through
certain sections of the country, it is
a wonderful surprise. The lfie, move
ment and activity is incredible, and
the people seem to have such a
metropolitan atmosphere with them.
Why, this Main street looks like
Broadway on a busy day, except that
it is cleaner, if anything. She Is a
winner, and if I can find suitable
buildings, I may even consider this
place as winter quarters for my
three shows. Ardmore has It all over
any town of its size I have ever seen,
and if these hustlers keep moving
they're going to catch up with Okla
homa City some day. That's what I
think of Ardmore."
C. A. Wortham is a well known
showman and traveler, and the owner
of two large midway organizations
and a big minstrel show. He has
traveled all over the United States
and Canada, and is regarded in
amusement circles as a coming
amusement magnate. He Is educa
ted and observant, and is well quali
fied to express an opinion.
Mr. Worthum left here today for
San Antonio, where he has charge
of the amusement features and the
joy zone for the big fiesta of flowers,
which i.s one of the big annual events
at San Antonio.

BIO BAND PLAY
MRS WALCOTT DESIRES THAT
THE OLD BOYS HAVE PRIVI
LEGE OF HEARING FIFTH AR
TILLERY BAND.
Arrangements are being made to
take the Fifth Field Artillery Band
out to the soldiers' home tomorrow
afternoon to play their regular con
cert, instead of playing at the junc
tion of Washington and Main streets.
' Mrs. Walcott is making arrange
ments, and requests that anyone own
ing a car communicate with her, and
she will be able to assign them. The
old soldiers nt the home, that is,
many of them, are unable to come
to the city at this time to enjoy
the festivities and Mrs. Walcott is
anxious that they be given the privi
lege of hearing this crack band while
in the city. She requests that enough
cars be furnished to take not only
the band, but as many visitors as
possible.
This will be a rare treat to the old
veterans who cannot come to the city,
and the trouble incidental to making
this arrangement is small. All should
communicate with Mrs. Walcott rela
tive to details, and they will be fur
nished. The Ardmorelte joins Mrs
Walcott in this request.

Whether Attack Proves Successful or
Not, This is Likely to Mark Close
of Verdun Campaign British At
tack Failure.
The German assault on Verdun is
now centered on Deadman's Hill, west
of the Meuse, which is the key to
further advancer and may mark the
close of the Verdun campaign, what
ever the outcome.
German statements today say that
the British troops made a strong
grenade attack last night on the Ger
mans at St. Eloi, but that the attack
was repulsed and the positions held.
Fighting on both sides of the Meuse
is in progress, although it is more
strenuous on the west bank. " On
other fronts there is little activity.
Captured Many French.
Berlin, April 11. The Germans cap
tured more than thirty-six thousand
French in the Verdun fighting, accord
ing to the Overseas News Agency

Verdun Losses Heavy.
London, April 11. Without pati3e,
the German crown prince, taking ad
vantage of the evacuation of the Beth
incourt salient by 'the French and
the occupation of that position by
the Germans, has thrown several di
visions against the new French line,
but so far has been unable to break
that line at any point.
The bombardment of the whole
front west of the Meuse is of in
creasing intensity on both sides, the
Germans moving down along the Hau-court-Bethncourt
line attacked tho
French positions south of the Forges
brook. Here they had to face tho
full fury of the French guns, which
cost them heavy losses.
The French front along the strat
egic sector extending from Lc Mort
Homme to Cumleres remained un
moved and further attempts to as
sault were arrested by the French
curtain of fire.
