The trip from Knoxville to Jellico
will be made over the Southern Rail
way, and from Jellico to Appaiacnia,
Va., over the L. & N. At Appalachia
the "special" will change to the V. &
S. W., over whose tracks it will run
to Bristol, where connection will be
made with the Southern again, over
which line the remainder of the trip
will be made.
This train of eight cars, which will
be equipped with everything neces
sary to make the trip' pleasant, will be
the home of the hundred Knoxville
business men for the four days of the
Letter to Business Men.
Secretary Jay Howenstine has ad-
dressed the following letter to every
member of -the local commercial or- day night at seven o'clock, April 11th
ganization, and business men urging to lay the last plank in the enter
complete co-operation in making the.tainment platform. 'Come to this
visit of the Knoxville business men
tomorrow a memorable one.
Dear Friend:
Just what the city of Knoxville
will think of Stanford depends on
whether or not you are willing to give
thirty minutes of your time tovard
entertaining the Knoxville delegation
at nine o'clock on the morning of
April 12. That is Wednesday morn-'
Stanford.
A big reception Committee of local
business men will greet the visitors
at the depot here, and all will march
directly to the courthouse where At
torney K. S. Alcorn wll make a one
minute address of welcome on behalf
of Stanford and the Chamber of
Commerce and the Knoxville boost
ers will make a short response. This
will be followed in informal hand-
trip. No expense has been spared in
the planning of this trip by the Knox
ville Board of Commerce to make it
a success, and allow the members of
the party the longest possible stay
in each town, and yet make the num
ber of towns necessary to cover so
much territory on the first trip.
Few realize the amount of work
'and preparation that is involved in
the running of one of these Trade
Trips. Before the train starts on its
way, the executive committee in
charge of the Trade Trip will have
spent many weeks in working out the
details, in oruer to insure no hitch or
confusion.
First, the route had to be selected;
the itinerary adopted and the ar
rangements made for the railway
equipment and for the facilities af
forded the members of the trip. The
commissary car must be stocked, the
supplies being, so far as possible, the
products of the sections to be visited
and bought in Knoxville, which in it
self should prove a big advertisement
for the trip; the red, white and blue
umbrellas to be carried by the mem
bers ordered, and the badges to be
worn secured. These badges will
liave .printed ,on them ."-"Knoxville's -First
Trade Trip, April 11th to 14th,"
and on the identification portion will
be printed the name and title of the
member and the firm represented.
This will be a great aid to the people
of the towns visited, as it will not be
necessary for one to ask names, but
by merely looking at any member's
badge one can get the member's name,
title and all. Besides these badges,
each member of the Trade Trip will
wear a white hat with the word
"Knoxville" printed on the band,
which will also be an aid in distin
guishing the local boosters from the
Trade Trip members, allowing them
to cet together in the shortest nnssi-
u, , -ri,Q, ,-, ,i, !, .o,-..
UIC nic. xno mi mc aMibu-
ment of the party to Pullman accom
modations to be looked after, and a
great many other things which must
be taken care of by the Trade Trip
committee of the Knoxville Board of
Commerce, to make the trip one that
will give maximum results to th
Knoxville business men as well as to
the business men of the towns to be
visited.
Reaching Richmond, Ky., at 7:10
p. m. on the first day out, the Knox
ville Trade Trip members will unload
at the depot, and headed by the Uni
versity of Tennessee band, march to
the business section of the city, where
they will hold a joint session with the
commercial organization of that
place in one of the town's large halls.
Speakers from the "special" will tell
the Richmondites about Knoxville,
what she buys and what she sells, and
lots more of general interest, while
the Richmond speakers will tell the
Knoxville party about their town,
what they make, what they hav to
sell, and many other things. Alter
nating between the speeches will be
concerts by the "Dalversity of Tennes
see Band.
At Middlesboro, where the "special"
will arrive at 4:45 on the second eve
ning out, April 12th, another evening
meeting will be held similiar tb the
one at Richmond, as will also be done
at Johnson City on the evening of the
third day and at Asheville on the eve
ning of the last day. At all of the
stops the band will play and at many
the Knoxville party will parade, and
at every stop the Knoxvillians plan to
make the most q tk tima the train
will tarry.

j The citizens of this town will meet

There will be 150 of Knoxville's

asked to entertain the Knoxville men
interested in the same profession or
business. This will only consist of
showing these men through your
stores or offices, and will only last for
thirty minutes, so give them the best
you have.
This is an EVERYBODY'S move
ment, and we must not let our neigh
boring towns out do us in this en
tertainment. Please bear this date and hour in
mind and be at the depot to welcome
these Knoxville men. Help to make
Stanford a by-word with Knoxville.
Yours for a bigger and better city,

Pictures Here.
Quite an interesting and novel fea
ture of the visit of the Knoxville
business men here Wednesday will
be the operation of a moving picture
machine which will take photographs
of Stanford life at the hour at which
the visitors are here. The Knox
ville boosters have, at "great expense,
engaged a well-known motion picture
maker to accompany them on their
First Trade Trip, to make pictures
of the "special" from the time it
leaves the depot at Knoxville until
it returns.
Pictures will be made of the crowds
that, greet the Trade Trip Party at
every stop of the train, and many
pictures will be made here, and the
TTnowillfi nartv has exnressed a wish
that atftmanv ueoule arrange'ttf"t$ir
in the picture as possible, as the pic
tures will not only be shown in Knox
ville, but will also be shown here and
in all of the other towns visited, as
well.
As the trade trip special will stop
in 43 towns in Tennessee, Kentucky,
Tennessee, Virginia and North Caro
ina, the pictures will prove a big ad
vertisement for Stanford, if a good
showing is made. Everybody should
turn out and give the "special" a
rousing welcome, and make the best
possible showing for the town.
The picture, which will be between
two and three thousand feet in
length, will be shown here in a few
weeks after the picture is made. The
exact date and place will be announc
ed later.
SPEAKERS AT LEXINGTON
Che
at Contest of Local Senior
Expression Pupils -.
The contest in public speaking and
reading was held at the Graded
School building Friday evening. The
event was assisted by the music de
partment and altho it was a very bad
night a large crowd was present. The
entertainment was divided into two
parts; the boys reciting first and be
tween each recitation was a selec
toin of music. There were only two
contestants from the boys and both
did their part in a pleasing manner.
They were Ferdinand Matheny, who
gave the reading "A Message to
Garcia," and was awarded first and
Clarence Singleton, a very close sec
ond, recited "Education and Re
sponsibility." The second part was
taken up with the girls with music
between each two recitati6ns. There
were four young ladies, all of which
deserve much praise. The winners
were Margaret Shanks reciting "The
Sioux Chief's Daughter," first and
Annie Katherine Matheny second,
gving "Jack, the Fisherman." The
i winners of each first were each giv
en a medal for their excellent work
by Miss Esther Burch, and will be
the contestants who will represent
the school at the contest to be held at
Lexineon. The judges were Mrs. W.
R. Todd, Miss Ruth Darnell and Rev.
P. L. Bruce.

right to tell you for the sake of oth

lieved me but cured me within two
months although I am a man of 65

TOGETHER
Purpose j of Visit of Knoxville
Trade trip Members Is To
Cement-Business Relations
t
r
Business Men of Knoxville Want to
Know More About Conditions Here,
and Desijj-ef People Here to Know
More About Knoxville as a Manufac
turing aruT?Jobbing Center.
Back of the white hats, the stripped
umbrellas, :fthe music, the fun and
good-fellowsliip of the Knoxville Trade
Trip, there4s a very serious purpose.
This Trade(Trip has a meaning, and
that meanin$is illustrative of the busi.
ness spirit of Knoxville.
For, be itjkown, that this is "Pros
perity YearHn Knoxville" her mills
and factories are running, and the
wheels, of (jommerce are humming.
Knoxville is stirred in every pulse and
fibre as she lias never been stirred be
fore with a! new spirit of enterprise,
of push and purpose that is built upon
the solid rocldfoundation of confidence
confidence' jinher own future; confi
dence in the-aoyalty of her people and
aggressivenessfo.f her progressive busi
ness men anii institutions.
Wm, H. Crouch, leader of the U. of T.
Band, which is to visit here.
It is in the spirit of this new pros
perity that this First Trade Trip is
being made, and it is far from a sel
fish spirit, for Knoxville is not coming
to sell; but to See and to BUY!
In her new prosperity she must look
beyond her own doors for new ma
terial. Knoxville wants to extend tb the
people of her sister towns and cities
the "glad hand," wants to know them
better, and extends to them an invita
tion to grow as she grows. Knoxville
wants us to profit by her prosperity.
There will be a result to this trip
that ought to be of special interest to
this town. Being, .us it is, in itself an
example of organization and efficiency,
the trip ought to stimulate greater in
terest in our local commercial organi
zation and in greater commercial ac
tivity. Then, too, the visit of the
Knoxville Trade Trip will offer to our
local boostdrsSS opportunity to do
some boosting ofheir own game. The
Special will darry representatives of
both of Kioxvills big daily papers,
newspapers:iWtre read far and wide.
The impre&Bley gather of the

FINE CATTLE MARKET HERE
Big
Run Here Monday and Top
Prices Were Realized.
The cattle market here Monday,
April Court Day, was one of the
finest ever known among stockmen
at this time of the year. There were
almost 800 cattle in the Nunnelley
Stock Pens and Manager T. W. Jones
with his assistants was kept busy all
day weighing and recording sales.
Some extra classy stuff was brought
in by the lower county traders, but
big feeders snapped them up quick
ly at fancy prices. The top price of
the day was $65 a head for some
choice feeders sold by "Uncle Jimmy"
Roberts, of Pulaski county to Senator
R. L; Hubble, of this city. From this
figure they sold down, the average
by the head, being about $50, and the
top figure by the pound about 8 1-4
cents. Buyers were on hand from
a dozen counties, and anything of
class changed hands quickly. Stock
men are all pleased with the outlook,
and a still better market with a bigger
run and more bidders is looked for
next court day.
BUSINESS FINE EVERYWHERE
"Business is fine all over the coun
try," said John Charles Osborne, of
Knoxville, who travels over consid
erable of the south for a big Louisi
ana lumber firm. Mr. Osborne is in
Stanford for a short visit with his
wife, to her; mother, Mrs. Charlotte
nueu;
earsf'tied
up in the east, which cannot be got
ten for western traffic. A promi
nent L. & N. official told me that the
L. & N. has. 35,000 cars in the con
gestion, and that it is cramped for
cars exceedingly to handle the big
business which is being thrust upon
it."

AUTO SHOW, TOO, ON MONDAY
More Cars Shown Than Horses and
Agents Are Very Busy.
Main street was lined with automo
biles Monday, and cattle traders at
the stock pens were not a bit busier
than were the agents for the various
makes of cars. Several sales were
reported and all of the agents said
that they have a number of live pros
pects on "the string." W. W. Hays,
who is local agent for the Studebaker
Six, of which Mahan & Conn, of
Danville have the general agency for
five counties, sold one of these hand
some machines to J. A. Robinson, on
the Danville pike. Through M. S.
Baughman, local agent for the Over
land, S. H. Baughman bought a Willys-Knight
touring car equipped with
the famous Silent Knight engine.
The Bailey Garage Company had a
four-cylinder Studebaker on exhibi
tion that is a beauty. Mr. Hays also
had a Chevrolet car here, while H. C.
Carpenter was busy all day boosting
for his famous Maxwells. W. L. Mc
Carty, newly appointed agent for the
Dodge, was extolling the merits of
that popular make, while H. C. An
derson booked a few more Ford or
ders, which is almost an everyday af
fair with him. Roy Arnold, maker
of the famous Arnold buggy, had a
beautiful model on exhibition here
Monday and sold three vehicles. Bris
Conn, of Danville, had a, very hand
some Buick'herej.and sold one to C.
BRAKEMAN'S HEAD CUT OFF.
William O. Taylor, a brakeman on
the local L. & N. freight, of which
Fox Dudderar is engineer and J. A.
Carter conductor, had his head cut
off, and of course, was instantly
killed when he fell under the train
while switching cars at Mt. Vernon
Friday night. It was rainy and wet
and it is supposed that Taylor slipped
and fell off a wet car. Taylor was
a young man and well liked by all
who knew him. He had only been

WAYNESBURG FARMS SOLD.
The hustling real estate firm of
Thompson & Reynolds, of Waynes
burg, has recently sold the Kirk Pad
gett farm of 65 acres of nice land on
Buck Creek in the Waynesburg sec
tion of Lincoln to a Mr. Tackett, of
eastern Kentucky for $1,200. The
same buyer also purchased through
these dealers the Luther Reynolds
farm of 60 acres in the same locality
for $1,500.

, From a small beginning the sale
and use of thisremedy has extended
to all parts of the United States and
to many foreign countries. When you
have need of such a medicine give
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy a trial

become so popular for coughs, colds,
and croup. Obtainable everywhere.
Interest in Eighth District Con
gressional politics was intensified
court day by the arrival of Congress
man Harvey Helm from Washington,
where congress is in session. Mr.
Helm spent Monday on the streets
shaking hands, and looking after his
political fences in this county. He
went from here to Shelbyville, it is
understood.
Further interest was aroused over
the informal announcement made
through local friends that State Sen
ator Charles F. Montgomery, of Ca
sey county, will be a candidate for
congress against Mr. Helm. Mr. J.
M. Carter, who is a relatives of Sen
ator Montgomery, said that Senator
Montgomery had phoned him Satur
day night that he would be a can
didate and requested him to inform
his friends. Senator Montgomery
was preparing to start for Frank
fort where he will be engaged this
week in the impeachment proceed
ings before the state senate against
County Judge Williams, of McCreary
county. Before the week is over.
Senator Montgomery is said to plan
to make his formal announcement
and to start an active campaign at
once all over the district. A num
ber of local friends of Senator Mont
gomery looked after his interests here
Monday and say they found a strong
sentiment for him in almost every
section of the county. Senator
Montgomery is a native of Lincoln
county, having been barn in the West
End, a son of the beloved Christian
preacher, Rev. J. Q. Montgomery,
and he also married in Lincoln, his
wife being a daughter of Col. T. L.
Carpenter. Democrats from adjoin

APPOINTED SCHOOL INSPECTOR
At the regular meeting of the
County Board of Education last week
Herbert Reynolds, of the Waynes
burg section, was appointed Super
visor of Schools for Lincoln county,
and will enter at once upon his du
ties, visiting and inspecting every ru
ral school in the county and seeing
that all conform to the standards.
Mr. Reynolds is very well qualified
for this work, having been a teach
er for a number of years. He has
recently been admitted to the bar and
is well versed on the school laws. The
County Board calls attention of the
district trustees to the fact that the
time of holding the election of school
trustees has been changed from the
first Saturday in August to the first
Saturday in October, and as they
understand the present law, the old
trustees hold on till the following
March.
