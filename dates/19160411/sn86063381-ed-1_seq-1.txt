A
CITY CHARTER ft
AMENDED TO PROV,
FOR WHITE WAY TAX
Committees Ask City Council to Take
Action Whole City Assessed
Now.
WANT ADJOINING PROPERTY
TO PAY FOR INSTALLATION
May Be Submitted to Voters at June
Election Committees
Hold Meet.
At a meeting last evening of the
committees of the city council and
Commercial club, appointed to in
vestigate the "white way" project for
Bemidji, it was decided that it will
be necessary to amend the city char
ter before a plan of city lighting is
adopted.
Against Entire City.
Under the city charter at present,
the installation of a "white way"
would be assessed against the entire
city. It has been pointed out that
is hardly fair inasmuch as the down
town districts benefit more by the
"white way" than do the outlying
resident districts.
Ask Amendment.
So as to equalize the assessment
for the installation of a "white way"
it was believed by the committees
that an amendment to the city char
ter should be passed so that the in
stallation of the lights could be as
sessed two-thirds against the adjoin
ing property owners and one-third
against the entire city.
At Primary Election.
The two committees went on rec
ord requesting that the city council
take action and that an amendment
to the city charter be submitted to
the voters at the primary election
June 19.
No plan of lighting will he adopted
until after that election.

WAR SURELY IS WHAT
SHERMAN SAID IT WAS
Don't blame your wife if
your buttons drop off. Good
linen thread comes only from
Belgium, and the war has cut
off the supply.
Don't be surprised if your
evening paper, once white,
has a pale, straw-colored com
plexion. The blue dye used
to tint yellow paper fibre is
unobtainableon account of
the war.
Those matches you used to
buy a dozen boxes for a nickel
have gone to 7 cents. A war
shortage of chemicals is to
blame.
