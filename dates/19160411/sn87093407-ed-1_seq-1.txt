New Council Fails on First Test of Municipal Efficiency
USUALLY some one councilman out of our nine will be right on any proposition.
However, the clash Monday over the firing of three committee clerks showed
them all nine of them—wrong.
Judge Moore, one of our "strong councilmen," who resigned from the council
efficiency committee because he didn't get the clerks fired, was wrong.
Councilman Erickson, who refused to vote, putting it up to the other council
men to "skin their own skunk," as he termed it, was wrong. This being a public skunk,

Gill's Statement
Mayor Oill made the following
statement:
"Mr. Btckingham is thoroly
familiar with the liquor situa
tion In Seattle, and I believe
he can help me clear up that
problem.
'•In my opinion, he showed a
desire to economize when a
county commissioner, that has
stamoed him as having a clrar
head in dealing with financial
matters.
"His Integrity and honesty
can't be questioned.
"He knows the men of the
department thru long years of
acquaintanceship and will work
with them, and they with him.
"I think he will be loyal to
me. He Is good natured and
at the same time has a lot of
backbone. I believe I have se
lected a mighty good man for
the job."
IH>nnld r> Olson, superintendent
of the Monroe state reformatory,

present about running the
department. I will have to
see first Just how things
have been left by Chief
Lang. .
"Every man, woman and
child in the city knows that
it is a simple matter to get
liquor. I think something
can surely be done by the
police department to stop
the Illegal trade. The drug
stores ought not to get
away with the stuff they art
pulling now."
"I therefore request that ycu
tender me your resignation, 'h#
same to take effect immedi
