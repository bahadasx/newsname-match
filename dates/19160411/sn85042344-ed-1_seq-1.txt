New Revolution.
Interest in the pursuit of Villa and
the di plomatio situation at Washing
ton was largely diverted today as far
as the border was concerned, to . the
reported raising of a new revolution
ary standard by Gen. Ynez balazur.
General siaiuzur, uu no
ing here, was one of the best known
of the Huerta generals. Ho is believed
to have crossed the border near OJ'
naga after issuing a statement de
nouncing Carranza for bringing about
the invasion of Mexico by Americans,
and declaring it his intention to de
fend the sacred soil of his native
'"tialazar i reputed onelif the ublest
of the Mexican generals. It was re
ported hero today by men who have
been closely associated with him that
he intends to declare for ellx Diaz.
It is known that up to a short time
ago Salazar was In the greatest pov
erty He complained bitterly that on
account of his -persecution" by
" Americans he wa forced to live on
the charity of friends. A few days be
fore his disappearance, however, he
received a large sum of money and
repaid several debts he had incurred.
On Intimate Terms.
There are a number of Americans
liere who are on intimate terms with
the vanished general who was willing
to admit individual Americans to his
"friendship, while never disguising his
hostility toward the American gov
ernment. These men aver that Salarar has a
very large following In northern Chi
huahua and that hundreds. If not
thousands, of the Carranza soldiers
who fought under him In previous
campaigns will gladly follow their old
leader if he summons them.
A story was current here tonight
'" that Salazar was in hiding In Juarez,
but as this was hardly possible with
out the connivance of the Carranza
officials, It was not generally credited.
Looting of Store
r ..r, r.ft rn,inl tiara hv A HI O M ()! Tl
mining concerns state that there has
been extensive looting oi stores aim
' warehouses In Parral and In towns In
that district. Some damage Is said
' to have been done to American prop-
a.. I. 1 ,. I n n .. ' n Th.
looting Is said to have been tho result
of tho desoerate condition of the peo
ple, who are almost destitute of food
and clothes, and to have no further
political significance. A telegram
was sent from hoie today to Governor
Enrlquez, governor of Chihuahua,
asking for protection for American
Interests.
Anxious About Cavalry
SAN ANTONIO, Texas, April 10. Dispatches from the
front indicating contact with the Villa troops were awaited
with anxiety at headquarters by General Funston, who
realized fully the dangerous position in which the com
manding officers of the cavalry detachments beyond Satevo
had placed themselves. Just where the American advanced
columns are, who are pursuing Villa in the vicinity oi Par
ral was unknown here and the difficulties General
Pershing has with communication made it a matter of
guessing whether another engagement had been fought.
It was assumed that Colonel Brown and Colonel Dodd
were continuing their hard riding along the trails about
Parral in pursuit of Villa, who was reported by Mexican
officials to have been in that district 48 hours ago, but no
reports indicating their exact locations were received dur
ing the city.
General Pershing continued to carry on the campaign
without sign of limiting the activities of his men and no
indication was evident here that any check on their activ
ities would be given.. General eunston said that so far as
he knew no deadline on the pursuit of Villa had been
fixed.. So far as headquarters officials know the American
troops are in Mexico to get Villa and no one has told them
where to stop.

WORK ON THE NAVAL

Subcommittee of the House
Naval Committee Con

WASHINGTON April 10. Draft
ing of the 1917 naval appro
priation bills, In which the administra
tion will launch Its flve-yoar Increase,
was undertaken today by the appro
priation subcommittee of the house
naval committee.
It was determined at the outset to
leave the building program to be con
sidered by the full committee. Vari
ous legislative provisions in the bill .
were discussed and tentative agree
ment was reached on a few items. The
committee decided, however, that no
statement of Its action should be
made public until its report had been
com pleted.
The most Important question con
sidered today related to the duties of
tho chief of operations. While final
decision wus not reached, the com
mitteemen were inclined to write into
tho law most of tho powers now con
ferred on the office by departmental
regulation.
Secretary Daniels has approved the
suggestion that the rank uud puy of
a full admiral be provided during the
tpnin-p. of fifficp. frir unv nfl'lninl Hp.
lulled as chief of operations. The law
would provide that the officer rank
next to Admiral Dewey, the admiral
of the navy, being senior to the throe
fleet udmlruls. Tho committee is un
derstood to have agreed upon this
plan.
