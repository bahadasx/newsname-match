LIVING COST
AGAIN SOARS
WASHINGTON, 1). C, April 11.—The people of'
the United States nre trying to pull themselves upi
by their bootstraps!
That is the only conclusion to ho reached from ex-|
animation of the latest figures on the rising cost of
living!
The war abroad has started the greatest wave of
prosperity the country has ever had; BUT, our man-!
ufacturers and exporters can get such big prices
abroad, the people of this country are bidding
against Europe For the foodstuffs of America.
RESULTS COST OF LIVING IS AEROPLAN
ING ABNEVEB BEFORE.
The best indication of cost of living, naturally, is
retail food prices. Only one agency in the United]
Slates compiles such figures-the United States bu
real of labor statistics.
It has just finished its compilation for January,
1916. The result shows thai the relative retail price
of 26 of the principal articles of food used en work-
Ingnutu'i tallies in the United states was higher in
January, 1916, than for any previous January since
the compilation of such statistics began.
The 'index number" (which is a means of weigh
ing and combining prices into a single unit of meas
urement) for these 12b articles has risen \)1 in Jan
uary. 1912, to 106 in January, 1916.
Not only that, hut the figure for January, 1916,
touches the highest point of ANY month since 1912.
The previous high point was in September, I!M4.
From thai time there was a steady decline in food
prices until March. 1015. At that time the effect
of the foreign demand and the rising wages and in
creased manufacturing costs began to he felt.
The retail price curse since March, 1915, has been
<-linibiug steadily from the index number !M>, up to!
Kin in January, "lf)l(i.
What has happened to food prices since January
is familiar to every housewife.
Butter that cost 35 cents in March a year ago is
selling, on the average, for 40 and 45 cents.
Lard that was 12 cents a year ago is now 13 to 15
cents.
Cream cheese has jumped to 22 and 25 cents,
where a year ago, at the low point in food prices, it
was 20 cents.
Irish potatoes have gone up, in some sections as
high as 'A 0 cents a peek.
Sugar, that absolute necessity in every house
hold, is up to 7 cents, where last year it was
»He.
The prices—both wholesale and retail -of
practically all meats, have risen considerably
since last year and continue to rise.

Quite a Game of Hide and Seek
IF YOU HAVEN'T JOINED
CLUB YET, TODAY'S TIME
The announcement in last
night's Times that a Justice to
the Mountain Club was to be
formed, under the leadership of
S. W. Wall, to restore the right
ful name to the Mountain brought
an icp.incii i,ite response.
Dozens of hading Tacomaus
signified their intention of affil
iating with and supporting the
new organization, and as soon as
the word of the movement lias
reached out across the seate it
is expected that leading Wash
iugtonians everywhere will be en
rolled.
The only fear on the part of
a few timid Tacomans was that
Seattleites would oppose the pur
pose of the club.
How groundless is this feeling,
Mr. Wall shows in an article,
printed on page 3 of today's
Times. There he reviews the
progress toward renaming the
mountain that has been made in
Seattle. '
Mr. Wall confidently believes
that many Seattleites will join
heartily in the effort to bring Jui
tice to the Mountain, and that
there will be an. organized opposi
tion of any sort.
If you haven't already done
YOl'R part to help the matter
along, begin now by clipping the
accompanying coupon and by
mailing It to Mr. Wall.
A meeting of the Justice to the
Mountain Club will be held in the
near future to map out a definite
course of action.
In the meantime every loyal
'I ,n iuria n ought to sign up as a
charter member.
WHAT DO YOU PLAN
FOR THE EVENING?
THEATRE? Dance? Card party? Social?
It doesn't make much difference which. You
can still find a good deal of additional enjoyment
each evening by reading the latest installment of
the novel-a-\veek in The Times.
Next week, a story of the North will hold the
boards.
Young school teacher. Big, lonesome woodsman.
Kidnaped, held by forre, the girl rages ag4iinst toe
lonesome North, Given freedom, she longs for the
wild, open country —and the big, strong woodsman.

Nonpartisan
Campaign to
Be Thorough
The campaign of the Nonparti
san league in Tacoina to Obtain
signatures of voters for a nonpar
tisan initiative measure promises
to be a thorough and systematic
one.
No voter will be allowed to
miss the opportunity of signing
his name to the measure which
will wipe out party lines in
atate and county elections.
To arrange the details for the
campaign and to complete the
Tacoma organization, the general
committee of 16 appointed last
Friday will meet Wednesday
night in the office of Govnor
Teiits, 1216 Fidelity building.
The plans will include Nonpar
tisan league luncheons every
Tuesday noon, to he addressed by
well known speakers from all
parties who are active In the non
partisan fight.
Workers will circulate petitions
In all precincts of the city. Group
meetings of these workers will be
held from time to time in the var
ious precincts.
From the headquarters of the
leaftue in Seattle It was reported
today that the organization Is
getting hundreds of new members

Idea is spreading rapidly over
the state.
