FIRM STAND WITH GER
MAN GOVERNMENT
DISCLAIMER TODAY
Ambassador is Expecting to Re- j
ccivc Note From Berlin at
Any Time.
(By Associated Press)
Washington, April 10.-Thc United
Slates government hus determined
that tile grave submarino situation
cannot be cleared up by a German
note denying that Germany's subma
rine torpedoed the British channel
steamer Sussex, and disclaiming
blame for attacks on other ships. This
conclusion was reached from an in
vestigation by the United .States of
recent, attacks on unarmed ruerchant
liir-n, which developed convincing evi
dence pointing to illegal submarine
operations.
An official announcement was made
today that Ambassador Gerard would
re?oive Germany's disclaimer tomor
row, lt is expected that Germany's
note and data from American foreign
representatives on the .recent subma
rine attacks will reach tho United
States in time for a cabinet meeting
Friday. Then, it admitted, definite
action will doubtless be takon. No
diplomatic rupture is likely, but
should such a crisis arise the presi
dent will go before congress.

STORY OF THE WILL
Henry Heard Tells of Going lo
Smith Home at Night to
Act As Witness.
Macon, tia., April IO-Janies M.
Smith, lato of Smithoniu, Oglethorpe
county, did not dio 'intestate-unies:,
he changed his mind shortly heforc he
died,.destroyed hi? will and saki noth
ing about H to his friends und those
whom he had witnesses to thc docu
ment.
Despite the fact that tho United
States district court li engaged ex
tensively in trying to decide who
properly are the heirs to approximate
ly $3,000,000 worth of property loft
by runner : jim" Smith, the than who
accumulated tho property decided for
himself, long before he died, what dis
position ho wanted made of lils es
tate, and set out his desires in l^gul.
and ia conformity with the thorough
ness of bia business methods, which
iiad marked him as one of the mo*t
remarkable men of his time in tieor-,
Bia.
James M. Smith made a will, which
was -witnessed by . Henry Heard, ot
Lnion Point, Ga., and Ilehrd's broth
er-in-law, Jesse Turnell. Whether or
not -there'was a third witness is not
known at thia time, but tho im
^rci?alon gathered, in recital of the
fact ig thai there was. Who tuc third
wttncjs was, if three people-witnessed
Mr. Smith's signature, can .not bc as
certained. One of the two' known wit
nesses ts dead; tho other is living nt
Unter? Point,1 and recalls distinctly the
Incident surrounding the making of
tho.will by-Mr. Smith, and conver
saWoiis with Mr. Smith about tho will
on more than One''occasion.
Wirti eventuall> has become, of the
wlllr however, ia a mystery. Thc re
maining living -witness-or, -the only,
ona knoarn--expresaos the belief that
lt will '?turh'up" sooner, or5 later, that
?(s existence .must bo known of by
iiomebody-interested in tho pending
litigation and finally, his opinion is, if
the courts do not determine the cana
in a way more beneficial to auch bene
Helarles aa ere named -in the will, it
will be brought forth /
