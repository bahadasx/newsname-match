English Committee Describes
German Treatment of British

CRUELTY IS NOTORIOUS

of prisoners and patients which
the American ambassador, James W
Gerard, in his report last Novembei
said was "even more unfavorhah
than I had been led to expect."
According to the released officer^
there are 15,000 and sometime!
more, prisoners in the camp, which
the committee says "'s an enormou?
population for so restricted an arer
as 10 and a half nores. There wer?

Rritlsh overcoats having been taker

Priestly says he found the men 1r
gaunt, of a peculiar gray palor anfl
verminous."
The supply of food was also In
sufficient even In the hospital until
supplies arrived.from England.
"The only provision for persona
cleanliness made for the men." say;
the report, "was one cupful of soft
soap Issued at Intervals of mant
weeks to a room containing 120. Ir
consequence, the men became In
cieaslngly verminous, and the cond'
tlon. coupled with cold and want, o
proper nourishment, was undoubted
ly the principal Inducing cause ol
the epidemic."
The epidemic hroke out In Decern
ber. 1014. "Thereupon." says th<
report, "the Oerman staff, mlUtan
and medical, precipitately left th?
A camp, and thenceforth, until August
1015, no communication was heir
between prisoners and their guard!
except by means of directions shout

outside the wire entanglements.
"All supplies for the men wer<
puahed Into the camp over chutes
and no medical attention during
the whole time was provided by th<
Herman staff."

Four British doctors were Infected
and three died. It was then that
MnJ. Priestley and Capt. Vidal went
' to the hospital to Join Capt. Txuider,
who was down with typhus. MaJ.
' j Priestley says that the patients, aliv^
I with vermin, lay so close to one an)
I
I other on the floor that he had to
strand stradle-leg across them eo ex
' amine them.
1 There were other conditions that
1 are indescriable. Theie was dlfficulty
in getting sufficient drugs and
dressings for a long time and extreme
bed sores were common. In
' several rases the toes of the whole
foot became tranerennus Tbo wnnh

I Dr. Aschenbach who was in charge
of the hospital and who, the committee
understands, received the ron
cross for combating the epidemic,
only paid one visit to the camp, accorlng
to the report and that after
some order was evolved. Sixty deaths
occured among the British and the
victims were burled outside the
' c. mp.
| "What the prisoners found hardesr
1 to bear In the matter of burial," says
itbe report, "were the Jeers with
r [ which coffins were frequently greeted
I by the Inhabitants of Wlttenburg
who stood outside the wires and wore
j permitted to Insult the dead."
After the middle of April the conditions
commenced to Improve and
^ with the arrival of warm weather the
cases rapidly decreased and by the
middle of May all the Britlah were
, convalescent. Adequate provision
' j was made to deal with any future
i outbreaks Improvements being effected
as a result of the visit of Ambassador
Gerard and members of bis
J staff.
The committee condemn the retention
of I)r. Aschenbach as head of the
camp, and a* evidence of his attitude
, cite an Incident. When one of his
(Staff reported the request of Capt
j.I-auder for medical requisites, the
I curtly' refused the request with the
. words: "Schwelne Englander."
I The report continues: "The cruel
ty of the adminstration of the Wlt
tenburg ramp became notorious. 8avI
aire dogs were habitually employed
i to terrorise the prisoners; flogging
i with ? rubber whip was frequent.
> Men were struck with little or no

of these men went so far as to look

j PLAN FOR MUCH SPEED
J Scout Cruisers of Newest Type Will

i
J '
Washington, Apr'l !>.?The house
s naval subcommittee on appropria
tions begin to-morrow framing the
i naval appropriation bill which ln1
eludes the adminstratlon's half bil
lion dollar five vear programme for
; new fighting ships. Chairman Padi
gett hopes to lay the completed moassure
before the house by April 25.
.. The big fight is expected to come
> 1 over the 1017 programme for capl;'
tal ships. Secretary Daniels has
i' recommended the authorisation of
1 two dreadnoughts and two battlel
cruisers. The navy general board
> contended for three battleships anl
four battlecruisers.
Present indications are that the
i' subcommittee will recommend two
! battleships ad four battlecruisers.
At the navy department work on
j the designs of the new ships has
1 progressed rapidly. Plans for the
i j battleships, large and ?mall sub1
marines, destroyers, gunboats hospital
ships and ammunition ships are
. virtually completed and it will take
only a few weeks after appropriation
for the vessels Is made to lay
>j specifications before private builders.
Plans for the battlecruisers and scout
> cruisers are also under way but will
> take some time to complete. An
Illustration of the problems involved
j became known to-day In regard to
i designs for the scout cruisers, Th^
i general board fixed 32 knots as the
! minimum speed for these eyes of the
fleet. Since designers began planfining
the ships, however, they have
hit upon a way to produce 3f> knot
craft of enormous cruising radius.
' As now planned the scouts will far
outclass anything ever contemplated
1 by any naval power.
Consume Iioss Coal.
The scouts will employ geared
steam turbines, the system at present
l installed In the most successful destroyers,
which has been found best
adapted to craft smaller than battlecruisers
for which exceutional speed
is desired. At cruising speed, howlever.
these engines will develop less
than 2 per cent, of their horse power
although their consumption of coal
Is enormous.
i To meet this problem it is planned
to equip the scouts with light power
i electric drive for cruising, the high
,'power turbine plants being idle until
they are needed for a swift dash.
The 1017 destroyers also will he
i of 35 knot speed instead of 32. the
' present standard.
The whole question of speed has
undergone a complete change in the
departmental engineer'ng bureau.,
i in the last few months. The stan
i dard long maintained hv the engine
i designers was that they could pro
vide horsepower in the ratio of 20
horsepower to the too engine weight.
This was far below the figure set by
Hritlsli and other foreign engine dci'Mgners
uiul partly amounts for th<>
i! slower soeed of Aniorlcftn battle
> craft. Tho figure was raised to 3d
> horsepower a ton some months ago.
i and recently the possibility of 4 5
> horsepower per ton has been said to
he possible through new engine tie*
I signers. With the decision to Ini
stall electric propulsion on battleships
soon to be laid down, half a
knot was added to their speed. They
- will make 21 knots under normal
' conditions, despite the fact that they
i will carry proportionately greater
armor and underwater protect* on
thnn any previous ships
Offer Greater Defense.
After long deliberation and much
| study and experimental maneuvrlng
at tne naval war college. It has
jbeen determined that the additional
. knot or so which foreign heavy ahip^
l.aay have does not effect the battle
efficiency of the squadron a? corui
pared to American craft. The additional
cririalng radio* and armor of
the American ships has been shown
to more than offpet the speed difference.

father knelt over the deathly pale
face of the young woman, and tried
to revive her, but she had evidently
been dead some hours.

appeared in her usual cheerful mood,
and no member of the family suspected
the dark future.
