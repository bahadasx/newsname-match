Mare Successes Repotted by Ger
man War Ostice Today
FRENCH LOSE COUNTER-ATTACK
British Also Repulsed in Hand Gren
ade Assault on German Trenches
at St. Eloi.
P.erlin, April 11. More German
successes northeast ot erdiin were
announced by tlio war oliice today.
Kast of thti Mouse counter attacks by
the French were repulsed and the
Germans took prisoners. At St.
Klol hand grenade attacks by the
British were repulsed.
Tho great battle west of the Meuse,
near Verdun, continues to rae, but
without notable result, aside from
heavy losses, since the evacuation by
tho French of the lietulncourt salient
Saturday night. A German attack with
a large force over a wide front has
been held back by the French except
on a stn-tch of 5imi yards, where
trenches were captured.
A dispatch from Paris yesterday
afternoon said: "The Germans con
tinued their attacks last night (Sun
day) in the Verdun region east and
west of the Meuse over a front 13
miles lous from ilill No. 304 to Fort
Douamont. The war oliice announce
ment of this afternoon says that In
the lighting west of the river for pos
session of Dead Man's hill, the Ger
mans were repulsed except on a front
of 500 yards near Hill No. 2. East
of the river the German assults
gained no appreciable results."
A dispatch from i'aris last night
said: "The battle around Verdun is
proceeding with unabated fury. West
cf the Meuso a bombardment or in
creasing intensity is reported in tho
French official communication issued
tonight. Fierce German attacks were
deiivcred against the French front
soulli of the. Forges brook, but though
tho Germans suffered very serious
losses, the French line between Le
Mort Homme and Cumieres remained
unbroken. '
.The Heilln report yesterday said:
Tho war otllce announced today that
in the fightit'g near Iiethincourt, in
the Verdun region, the town and two
fortified points of the fort to the
southwest were isolated. The French
were cut off, losing 714 prisoners, two
guns and 13 machine guns. The losses
of the French in killed or wounded
were considerable."
London, April 11. Lieut Gen. Sir.
Percy Luke, commander of the Urltish
forces In Mesopotamia, reports that a
Iiritish attack on the Turkish position
at Sannayyat on the Tigris river, just
below Kut L'l-Amnra, failed to break
through the Turkish lines, according
to a dispatcli from London.
The Mesopotamia statement Riven
out last evening by the othcial press
bureau says: "No attack on San
nayyat was made on April C, aa re
ported in the Turkish communication
of April ID (i'th). Sir Terry Lake re-
ports that an attack made at dawn
on the ytii laiieii to pot inrougn me
enemy's lines. The operations were
much hampered by Hoods which are
extend in.c"
A dispatch from London last nifiht
said that the failure of the l'.ritlsh
troops to penetrate the Turkish posi
tions at Sannayyat will come as a
disappointment to the Itritish pub
lic, which had hoped after the recent
victoiy at I'mm el licnna that (suc
cess would speedily attend the opera
tions for the relief of Gen Townshend
ami his men belieged In Kut-Kl
Anuira.
Tho check to the Hritish operations,
according to the olHcial report, was
due to tlio floods, which arc rapidly
extending and seriously hampering
the Iiritish movement-. The reliev
ing force consists nl two divisions, one
under Lieut-Gen Gorringo in chief
command on the left bonk of th
Tigris, and the other under Gen Keary
on the right bank. It is supposed
there is another division in reserve,
but of this nothing Is ollicially known.
Tho Sannayyat position extendi
about two miles on cither bunk ot the
Tigris, the left flank resting on the
Suwekio marsh and tho right (lank
on tho nameless marshy ground
stretching 12 miles between Orak und
Kssinn. Apparently, tho Iurkisli po
sition at Sannayyat 1ms been Htrongly
reinforced since tlio Turkish defeat ul
Uniiiicllleiina.
Kven should Gen Oorrlngn succeed
In driving tho Turk3 from Sannayyat,
there Is still another strong Turkish
position at Kssinn, both the flanks of
which are protected by wnter de
fenses, before reaching Kut-Kl-Amnra.
Gen I'orrlngo has had great experleuei)

To Choose Delegates to National
Republican Gathering
PRIMARY LAW IS DISCUSSED
Consent of Candidates Must Be Se
cured Before Names Can Be
Placed on Ballot.
Burlington, April 11. The
can state committee held a
republi
meeting here yesterday afternoon and decided
to hold a i-tate convention at .Mont
pelicr, May 20 to choose delegates
and alternates to the national republi
can convention at Chicago.
Mt ?as decided t, ndopt as a basis
cf representation nt tlio convent'j:i
the republican' vote for governor in
the election of i:U4.
The matter of temporary organiza
tion of the convention, after discis
sion ol available men. was referred to
the executive commitee, with power
to act, as were the various details con
nected with the convention. May 10,
the day of the primary election, was
designated as the day for holding can
cuses at which delegates to the state
convention shall be elected and a call
for election of town and city commit
tees at the same time will be issued
late:.
There was considerable discussion
of the questions presented by the new
primary law, and it. was the unani
incus opinion of the committe that
every am to the obtaining oi a full
and fair expression of the wishes of
the republican voters of Vermont as to
a candidate for president should bt
given by the party organization. Moth
ods of cli'ecting this were discussed
and a statement will be issued latci
by chairman Wilson, covering this
ground.
Earle S. Kinsley of Rutland, republi
can national committeemen from Ver
mont. and Guy V. Kuiley of Esse
Junction, secretary of state, were call
ed into conference with regard to tin
practical application of the prbnarj
law. They stated their underBtnndin;
of its operation and Mr. Railey explain
cd some of the problems that have
arisen with regard to the machinery
under the law and the interpretation
that he and the attorney general put
upon them.
Although Secretary of State Bailey
has interpreted the statute relative to
tho preferential presidential primary
as meaning that no names shall Ik
printed on the ballots unless some can
dldate gives his written assent, he ob
tained the opinion of Attorney Goner
al 11. G. Barber on the subject, whicl.
is corroborative of Secretary Bailey's
views. Mr. Barber's opinion follows:
"Replying to your Inquiry I beg to
.state that under Section tl of Faid aci
you would not be justified in print itr:
the namo of a person on the president
ial primary ballot as a candidate fo;
office of president of the I'nited States
unless such person has given his writ
ten ussent."

While repairs were being made at
