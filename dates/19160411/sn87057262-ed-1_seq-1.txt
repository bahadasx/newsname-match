until nearly train time and then

woman from Pittsburgh she knew.
The agreement then was made that
Mrs. Howard should come to the
theatre that night and wait until her
husband had finished his act and then
they would go to the train together,
mstead of his wife coming to the
theatre, Howard was told by Mrs.
Lamberti that his wife was suicide.
Howard had just finished making up
when Mrs. Lamberti appeared. Her
face was white and when Howard an
swered her knock, tried to tell him his
wife was dead. She hesitated and
Howard asked:
"Where is Irma?"
"She is dead," Mrs. Lamberti blurt

Howard turned white and for an in

that the French losses have been very
heavy.
Throughout yesterday the Germans
charged ceaselessly, throwing one di

on Dead Man's hill with machine like
precision. iSo well did the French
sustain the shock that only at advanc

in penetrating trenches. In most in

Wilson and Marshall.
WASHINGTON, April 11.—Vice
President Marshall, again the running
mate for President Wilson and Sen
ator J. Hamilton Lewis, temporary
chairman and keynoter at the demo
cratic national convention, is the
prospective arrangement, according
to many democratic leaders gothering
here for the meeting of state chair
men Thursday.
Senator Lewis announced today that
talk of his possible candidacy for the
vice presidency had been dispelled
with the determination of Marshall
to run again. Two United States
senators are to be elected in Indiana
this fall and the presence of Mar
shall's name on the ticket is figured
by democrats here to aid their party's
candidates. Hence the withdrawal of
Lewis.
A recent visit of National Chair
man Wm. F. McCombs to Washing
ton, paved the way for Lewis' prob
able selection as temporary presiding
officer at the St. Louis convention. It
was desired to have a western mail
and the senate whip is said to be
satisfactory to the president, who
will have the final say.
1
John T. Adams of Dubuque, was
re-elected republican national com
mitteeman over John Olson of For
rest City by about the same ma
jority.
It is believed there will be oppo
sition to Lewis in the national com
mittee. His own state committeeman,
Charles Boeschenstein, a close friend
of Roger Sullivan, is opposed to
Lewis and will vote against his selec
tion for the chairmanship, it is said.
Lewis campaigned against Sullivan
when the latter ran for the senate in
