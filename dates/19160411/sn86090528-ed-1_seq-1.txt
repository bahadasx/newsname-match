FAVORITES
By United Press.
Springfield, 111., April 11. With only
two candidates in the field: Woodrow
Wilson on the Democratic ticket and
Lawrence Y. Sherman, Jinois favor
ite son, to head the Republican party,
tho first Illinois presidential prefer
ence primary Is being held today.
Because there are no bitter contests
leaders declare the strength of their
respective parties will hardly be Indi
cated by the result.
There are a few districts however,
where Republican and Progressive as
pirants to the convention have filed
no preference" petitions, where a
heavy vote is ex-ted.
Because all these fights are being
waged in the Republican ranks, Dem
ocratic politicians declare their op
ponents' vote will bo considerably
larger than that of the democrats and
emphasize that the vote today will not
indicate the returns of the presiden
tial election Nov. 7.
The Republicans say they expect a
200,000 plurality this year. Under
normal conditions this state is Repub-
ican with a plurality of lOO.OuO.
The state and county primaries will
be held Sept. 13.

stopped to discharge passengers, and
the driver of that team of mules, Mr.
Officer, stopped his team and stood at

wended its weary way from this cor

had got in. the clear. Yes, sir, that
boob actually did. that actually com
plied to the letter with the ordinance
recently enacted by the city council
of Chickasha. Ivow, do you blame me
for laughing? Let go my collar!"
"Aw go on, you simp," said the po
liceman giving the Man on tho Streets
a parting shake, "you're dippy. . That
fellow's a stranger in town. He's just
read the ordinance and that's all he
knows about it. Got a match?"

A banner year in bapbal! la pnjt

tional league and President Johnsoqi
of the American league in statements,
prepared exclusively for the United;
Press today. 1
On the eve of the opening of the;
baseball season tomorrow, the head
c-C the two leagues predicted closa
races for the pennant and a great re
vival of interest in the game, Thq
statements follow:
By John X. Tener, ' '
(President of the National League.!!
New York, April 11. It Is far from
an unusual or new prediction for ma
to state that I believe baseball wilt
enjoy an exceptionally prosperous and
succ-isful year this season. This Ia(
the opinion of all basball men, genen
ally and freely made.
The reasons for baseball men tiilnfct
ing it will be a great year for the Na
uuuai game are round la the unpre
cedented prosperity ot the entirei
country and the internal conditions:
existing In the baseball world. It ii
only natural to expect that such CO"
ditiona will, produce extremely gratl
flying results in baseball. What 1
more nntural than that the average
American citizen with plenty of mon
ey In his pocket should patronize thai,
national sport at every possible op
portunity, especially when there la(
nothing In its management to whicb;
he can take exceptions?
From my own personal contact wltK
business men everywhere, I am led td.
believe that interest in baseball lyis
been greatly stimulated by recent de
velopments and occurrences, I am
willing to take the judgment of the av
erage business man on t'1'? subject,!
as I think lifs opinion in most ev
erythhig that interests us Americans
is a good barometer on which to base
a judgment. I believe the public an
ticipates with more genuine interest
and fervor the opening ot the profes
sional baseball season this spring thani
it has evinced for years.
And mere is a reason for this ad
vanced interest. Conditions are set
tied, there are no diverting agencies
in the field, harmony exists among the
professional ranks, and therefore the
publie is assured that more good base
ball will be seen on the diamond this
year than has been obtained for sev
eral seasons. I am very much pleased
with the existing conditions In the Na-.
tional league. Naturally we expect
a big year. Most of the clubs have
been strengthened in playing material
and a strong fight for the pennant is
sura to ensue from the playing of the
first to the last game. Personally I
expect to see a keen, spirited fight for
the championship. Looking at the
temns as they lined up in th south, it
is absolutely beyond the ken of proph
ecy to say which club will win. An
unusual amount of interest has been
injected into the senior league by rea
son of the amalgamation which, took
place getween the Chicago National
and Federal league clubs. The publio
is quite alive to the situation as pre
sented in the Windy City, and many,
conjectures are expressed as to wheth
er the injection of the Federal league
talent into the Chicago National
league club will make the reconstruct
ed team a strong contender for the
championship. Several other Nation
al league clubs have added to their
list ot players with the exception
that the acquisitions will be of mate
rial benefit to them in playing
strength. Personally I have no doubt
that some of these players will prove
ot value to the clubs which acquired!
their services.
Everything considered, I cannot help
