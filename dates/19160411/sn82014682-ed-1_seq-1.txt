bill which precipitated a long and general discussion 6( his proposal and

The Californian proposed an amendment restoring the 'duties on

" Senator Works urged a tariff of a cent a pound on grapefruit and
lemons. :He asserted that when the present tariff law wa3 being framed
"a corrupt lobby-misled. Congress by. false representations." . '
i To reduce, the tariff on lemons, he declared, was disastrous to the
Arperican lemdn industry. "One of the most corrupt efforts to control
legislation that ever existed "he called the movement to prevent a tariff
from being imposed on these products. He. said that already.a $75,000
suit had resulted from the action of Congress, a man claiming this sum
was due him for his services in bringing about a reduction of the duties.

SAYS PRESIDENT'S WISH
WILL, BE STRONG FACTOR
K By C. 3. ALBERT.
rSpedal 8ur-Baetia Corrsrocndanc ,
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 31.
The sugar situation has become mud
dled. Democratic senators who be-
lleYA HPnr shnulrt ho nlarort '-nn ihet
free list are responsible. The entfre
prooiem musi oe inresnea out in tae
senate and mulled over Is conference
before a solution of the problem La
found. -
Whatever the'tfinal net outcome
may be, the protective duty of one
cent fer pound will remain. There
might be a time limit of four years
attached to the. legislation, but ttat
means little under existing conditions.
The $45,000,000 In revenues derived
from this tax on sugar will be more
badly needed In 1920 than at present
It surely Is a safe prediction that gov
ernment' expenditures will continua
to grow each year and the necessity
for receipts will remain. .
Why Change Was Made.
Here Is an" explanation of the causes
leading up the the muddle: - .
When the sugar- repeal bill was un
der discussion in the House, Senator
Simmons and other. Democratic lead
ers took the subject up. ' They tenta
tively agreed that In order to provide
for the extraordinary expenses Incur
red by increasing the army and up-'
building the navy, the sum of $70,000.
000 must be realized from taxation of
