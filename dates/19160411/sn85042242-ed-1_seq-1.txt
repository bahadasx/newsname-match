STEEN ANNOUNCES
Before Leaving for Home at
Rugby, Gave Out State­
ment.
State Trfeasurer John Steen left for
his old home at Kugby aunday night
on No. 2, and will look after some per­
sonal business matters at that place
in connection with his farm. Before
leaving for the east, in a conversation
with the Tribune representative, Mr.
Steen said: "I am a candidate for the
republican nomination and re-election
to the office of state treasurer. I am
now serving my first term. Ana it has
been my aim to give the state a clean,
careful and business-like administra­
tion of the affairs of the oitice, and I
have been guided solely by what I
have deemed the best economic inter­
est of the state."
No Other Candidate.
There is no other republican candi­
date in the field for the nomination.
Mr. Steen states he will not be able
to be absent from the office to make
a close canvass of the state, as his
duties to the state will not allow his
absence from the office long enough
to make the trips.
Has Many Friends.
The incumbent of the treasurer's of­
fice has many friends in all parts of
the state. Many of his opponents of
two years ago have signified their in­
terest in the continuance in office for
another term which automatically ter­
minates any man's connection with
the state treasurer's office.
CHARGE POLITICIAN
WITH GRAFTING
Chicago, April 10.—Francis A.
Baecker, republican state central
committeeman, was indicted by the
April grand jury today on charges of
conspiracy and operating a confidence
game. Jointly indicted with Baecker,
who is a 21st. ward politician, were
Thomas (Spike) Hennessey, North
Side saloonkeeper Paul Schoop, for­
mer saloonkeeper, and Isadore Rosen.
The indictment contained 17 counts,
15 of whjch refer to the conspiracy
as fraudulently and feloniously en­
deavoring to extort money from sa­
loonkeepers, women and others. The
other two counts charged money was
obtained by operation of a confidence
game.
Barnes Still
Against Teddy
New York, April 10.—William
Barnes, formerly chairman of the re­
publican state committee, in a state­
ment issued here today attacked for­
mer President Roosevelt and denied
published reports tliat he would not
oppose the nomination by the repub­
lican party of Mr. Roosevelt for the
presidency.
"This year," Mr. Barnes asserted,
"the periodical candidacy of Mr.
Roosevelt for president of the United
States is based upon Americanism
and no sporadic support, as he is re­
ceiving comes from his declaration in
behalf of proper national defense."
".Mr. Roosevelt is not responsible
for any natural phenomena, nor has
he a patent on the obvious. That
this country should be properly de­
fended is not open to debate.''

Women of Bismarck Have Right
to Cast Ballot Upon the
Proposition.
BOARD ASKS FOR
$50,000 BUILDING
A special school election will be
held tomorrow al the Will school for
the purpose of getting authority to is­
sue $50,00-0 for the erection of anoth­
er grade school.
The board of education is divided
upon the location of the school. It
is generally the concensus of opinion
that a comprehensive building policy
should be announced and the selec­
tion contested squarely upon it.
It is known to all that additional
room is needed, for Bismarck has
outgrown its school facilities. If
(here is any opposition to the'present
bond issue, it comes ffom those who
file new buildine near-, the North tt,a /wm»n«
the new buiktyng near, the North
Ward school.
There are other sections of the
city practically without school facil­
ities. Those conversant with the sit­
uation state that, two grade school
units could be built in different sec­
tions of the city, reducing the ex­
treme distances now traveled by chil­
dren, especially those in the primary
grades.
The election will be held in the
"Will school, between the hours of
9:00 a. m. and 4:00 p. m. Women
have the privilege to vote upon this
question.
Oppose North Ward Site.
Two petitions signed by a number
of residents of the east end district,
asking that the proposed new school
buileling be erected on a site east of
Fifth street and south of Main street,
were submitted to the board last eve­
ning. The matter was referred to
the building and grounds committee.
No intimation was given as to where
the building will be located by the
board, but Supt. C. C. Root was asked
to furnish the board the number of
pupils from the various districts,
namely, west and east of Fifth street
and south of the railroad tracks.

Washington, April 10.—Investiga­
tion of recent attacks on unarmed
merchantmen carrying Americans has
developed such a convincing array of
evidence, pointing to illegal submar­

sulting grave situation cannot be
cleared up by t.ne German note deny­
ing that a German submarine tor­
pedoed the English channel steamer,
Sussex, and disclaiming attacks on

London, April 10—Without pause,

occupation of that position by the
Germans, has thrown several divi­
sions against the new French lines,

Meuse is of increasing intensity on
both sides.. The Germans moving

Heavy Losses.
'Here they had to face the full fury
of the French guns,which cost them
heavy losses. The French front along
the strategic sector extending from
LeMort Homme to Cnmieres remain­

their position in the Caillelto woods,

S
Punitive Expedition Finds Itself
in a Very Tight
Place.
EI Paso, Texas, April 10.—Clen. Ga­
briel Gavira, Carranza commander at
Juarez, tonight announced that the
forces in the de facto government
were in a positiaatt^ tnke immediate
control of the Villa situation if the
American troops 'Withdrew.
Gen. Gavira's statement was made
in connection with the announcement
of Major General 'Scott, chief of Am­
erican army staff, that the purpose of
the expeditionary force would be con­
sidered accomplished when the Vil
listas bands were dispersed, or "as
soon as the troops of the de facto
government are able to relieve them
of the work."
Sufficient Men.
"We have more men than enough
now," said General Gavira. "If we
were able to oversonie Villa when l\e
had 17,000 men, over 100 cannon, and
plenty of supplies, we should .be able
to dispose of him now, when his
numbers have dwindled to a few hun­
dreds. But it is a big territory to
operate in and a single man lias more
chance lo escape it ml hide than a
large force would have. However,

out proper medical care, lie will sur­
vive long."
The arrival of General Eertani in
Juarez gave renewed foice to the re­
port that Gen. Gavira lias been or­
dered to the lield.
Punish Conspirators.
General Gavira said today the trials
of the men implicated in the plot to
seize Juarez in Ihe interests of Fe­
lix Diaz had been practically com­
pleted and that ihe death sentence
would probably be passed in three
or four cases.
Increased Precaution.
Columbus, Texas, April 10.—In­
creased precaution to guard the mili­
tary base at Columbus and the Amer
ican line of communication, the ar­
rival of a number of strangers in
town, and what seemed to be an air
of suppressed excitement about mili­
tary headquarters, all contributed to­
day to the belief that the authorities
here believe there are about to be
important developments in the puni
tive campaign in Mexico. Because
of the delay in communication due
to the delay of extending the wire­
less field station in the field of Sate
vo closer to the camp of Genreal
Pershing, no reports concerning the
progress of the advance American
detachment was received today. It
was expected, however, that com­
munication would be re-established
during the night.
In Tight Place.
San Antonio, Auril 10.—Dispatches
from the front indicating conflicts
with the Villla troops were awaited
with anxiety at headquarters by Gen
Funston, who realized fully the dan­
gerous positions in which command
ing officers of the cavalry detach­
ments beyond Satevo had placed
themselves. Just where the Ameri­
can advance columns are, which are
pursuing Villa are unknown here, and
the difficulties Gen. Pershing has
with communication made it a mat­
ter of guessing where another en­
gagement had been fought.
Gen. Pershing continues to carry
on the campaign without signs of
limiting the activities of his men,
and no indication was evidenced here
that any check on their activities
would be given. Gen. Funston said
that so far as he knew no dead lines
on the pursuit of Villa had been fix­
ed.<p></p>MV

Wanted School House
Feared Location of a
Detention Hospital
Stormy Session.
iWlien the gavel fell opening the
meeting of the city commission last
evening, nearly 123 men, largely
property owners, were gathered in
the council chamber, to protest
against the location of the detention
hospital in their immediate neighbor­
hoods. Anton I5eers of the south
side arose as soon as the commis­
sion had opened for business, and de­
livered himself of a long speech in
which he stated that some people
were anxious to have the detention
hospital put over on the south side
so as to inflict the south side people
with that calamity and rid the west
end section of the detention hospital.
Expected School.
Going farther into the subject, he
also stated that the south side for
a number of years had not had its
share of the improvements that the
north side had received. Poor walks,
poor schools, poor streets and the
children of the south side having to
walk 20 to 25 blocks to reach the
grade school. The gist of his speech
indicated that the people of E'is
marck, instead of giving the south
siders a school house wished to put
over on them a hospital where peo­
ple with contagious diseases could be
placed until cured.
iMr. Boelter Had the Floor.
Mr. iBoelter also made some very
interesting remarks and stated that
the city had a place already, and in­
stead of spending $13,000 for a new
building, it should spend a few hun­
dred dollars on the old building and
let it stay where it now is, as the
hospital was there before those peo­
ple came to this city.
Bids Opened For Site.
The commission opened the bids
for a site and after a short review
of the matter finally disposed of it
by rejecting all the bids. They au­
thorized the auditor to have the city
engineer examine the old building
and estimate the cost of a modern
water and heating system in it.
Hack License Matter.
Following the hospital matter, rout­
ine matters came on for hearing. A
measure was introduced in which it.
was desired to raise the license of
hacks, taxicabs, etc., from the rate
of $10 per year to $25 for each ve­
hicle operated. Mr. Best led the dis­
cussion in this matter and teh mat­
ter was referred to a committee to
look into the feasibility of the pro­
Mme. Uadski.

posed ordinance, and to report on It

City Scavenger.
The bids were opened for the ap­
pointment of a city scavenger. The
Wachter Dray and Transfer company
put in a bid for the removal of garb­
age cans, per can. 25 cents for each
load or portion of a load of ashes, re­
fuse and such other matters at 50
cents per load. Special trips at 50
cents per load. George Walters, the
other bidder, had bid on cans, 25
cents. Loads or portions of a load,
40 cents. Special trips with loads or
parts of loads, 40 cents. It was mov­
ed that Mr. Walters be given the con­
tract if sufficient bond with two sure­
ties were given. At this juncture the
matter was again opened for discus­
sion and the matter referred to Com­
missioners Battey and Kirk, to be re­
ported upon at the next meeting.
City Sprinklers.
The matter of springling the
streets was taken up and the commis­
sion authorized the auditor to adver­
tise for bids, using as his basis the
requirements of previous years, with
the exception of the weight of the
teams used.
Permits For Ferries.
Ferry permits were granted H. C.
Rhud of this city and Mr. Gossard of
Mandan. The two ferries will be lo­
cated south of the Missouri bridge,
and 'Mr. Gossard's ferry will be plac­

Bids were opened for the construc­

Declares It Is Necessary That
Railroads Become Availably
At Once.
Washington, April 10.—Such &<
marked improvement in conidtiona
along the Mexican border has been re­
ported by General Funston that the
war department is now considering
arawing upon some of the troops sta­
tioned in Texas to strengthen the
ever-lengthening line of communica­
tion of the expedition seeking Villa.
Army officials stated tonight that
from now on infantry would be used
to reinforce the communication line,
the cavalry being kept at the frontier
for the actual work of running down
the outlaws. A part' of the 24tn In­
fantry, negroes, withdrawn from Del
Rio, Texas, at the request of local
authorities, after one of the soldiers
had been killed by a Texas ranger,
while attempting to arrest nim, has
been ordered into Mexico.
Tank Motor Trucks.
Evidence ocntinued to accmulate
today to route rumors of the pending
withdrawal of the expedition. Soon
after it became known that additional
troops were to be sent across the bor­
der, the war department' announced
the purchase of six large tank motor
trucks to replace six trucks now used
to carry gasoline for Gen. Pershing's
supply motors and aeroplanes.
State department dispatches indi­
cate. that the Carranza authorities are
viewing with some anxiety the con­
tinued presence of the American
troops in Mexico and are inclined to
believe the object of the expeutlion
has been accomplished in the distters
^"Vi Hst'K maiti Command. It has"

no suggestion front the de facto gov­
ernment as to the establishment of a
dead line" beyond which the Ameri­
can troops should not go or as to a
date on which they should be w..-\
drawn.
Senator Fall Caustic.
Senator Gallinger, the republican
leader in the senate, today made pub­
lic a letter from Senator Fall, who has
been on the border, reporting condi­
tions to the minority senators. Mr.
Fall assailed the border guard, and
said the raid on Columbus was made
possible by a wide gap in the patrol,
and declared that he had been reliably
informed that unless the American
army was given full control of the
Mexican Northwestern railroad witif
in a week of the date of his -etter,
April 4, the expedition would have to
be withdrawn. Officials pointed out
today that tomorrow was the date
fixed for the witndrawal by the Sena­
tor's informant and that Secretary
Lansing had announced the railroad
question was no longer a factor in
the expedition.
The latest advices from General
Pershing dated last Sunuay demon­
strated conclusively officials believe
that the American troops have not
been engaged in any important clash­
es with Villa bandits over a week, or
since Col. Brown's skirmish at Aguish
Calientes on April 1.
Senator Fall, of New Mexico, who
at the request of republican senators
went to the Mexican border immed­
iately after the raid on Columbus, to
investigate conditions there, declared
today in a letter that the Carransa
troops were not co-operating with the
American troops to capture Villa. He
maintained that the border patrol was
not. of adequate force and that a gap
of nine miles had made the Columbus
raid possible.
No Attempt Made.
"The Mexicans," said the letter,
"have made no attempt to attack Vil­
la at' all, and are not in any way co­
operating with our forces or attempt­
ing to check Villa's retreat or assist
in his capture.
"On his retreat- Villa's first camp
was within five miles of 700 Carranza
soldiers to whom Raymond Reyes re­
ported and whom he pleaded with to
accompany him to attack Villa's «00
men. The Carranzistaa refused."
Troops Aaleep,
Describing in detail the Columbud
raid from information gathered at
Columbus, Senator (Fall said the ban­
dits had made their way into the
heart' of the town, looted two stores
and set fire to two buildings before
an alarm was given. With the aid of
a machine gun, placed within 20 fleet
of the American army hospital, ho
said the citizens then fought with the
bandits for another fifty minutes in
fore the troops appeared.
No Protection.
The letter emphasized the possibil­
ity of the Mexican trenches .construct­
ed facing the border and other border
towns. He said stories of concentra­
tion of Carranza troops along the bor­
der had been exaggerated.
The senator said at the time he
wrote there was no border patrol west
of Douglas, and had been mm be­
tween Gibson ranch and Hactta,
miles to the west He declared Villa
sympathizers were overrunning Tlrto
ally all of Northern Mexico and Villa
could easily capture the
there.
