SUB-COMMITTEE DRAFTING
NAVAL APPROPRIATION BILL
Building Program to be Considered by
Full Committee of House.
Washington, April lO.-rDrafting of
the 1917 naval appropriation bill, with
which the administration will launch
its five year increase program, was
undertaken today by the appropria
tions sub-committee of the house na
val committee. " '
It was determined at the outset to
leave the building program to be con
sidered by the full committee. Vari
ous legislative provisions in the bill
were discussed and tentative agree
ment was reached on a few items. The
committee decided, however, that no
statement of its action should be made
public until its report had been com
pleted. The most important question con
sidered today related to the duties
of the chief of operations. While fi
nal decision was not reached the com
mitteemen were inclined to write in
to the law most of the powers new
conferred on the office by departmen
tal regulation.
Secretary Daniels has approved the
suggestion that the rank and pay o
a full admiral be .provided during the
tenure of office for any officer detail
ed as chief of operations. The law
would provide that the officer in rank
next to Admiral Dewey, the admiral
of the navy, being senior to the three
fleet admirals. The committee is un
derstood to have agreed upon this
plan.
shown. Near Komera in the Fripet
Marsh region a German attack launch
ed by means of boats broke down un
der the Russian fire, while on the low
er Stripa the Russians captured a
German trench and held it against
counter-attacks, inflicting heavy cas
ualties on the Germans.
In Asiatic Turkey the Russians have
penetrated to the region of Diarbekr,
Armenia, while in the district of Bit-
lis several Turkish attacks have been
repulsed. South of Lake Urumiah
region the invaders apparently are
coming up with the 1 urKisn main
forces, the latest official report an
nouncing that in engagements fougnt
with laree numbers of, Kurds the
Kurds were supported by regular Turll-
ifch infantry.
In Mesopotamia the British in their
attempts to relieve their compatriots
besieged at Kut-el-Amara, attempted
to break the Turkish lines, but failed,
according to a British official commun
ication. The floods are still badly
hampering the movements of the
British.
The Italians have penetrated ad
vanced Austrian trenches on the To
nale Road near Sperone and have set
on fire with their guns the town of
Coldonazao in the Sugar.a valley, Vi
enna repors. Otherwise on the Aus-tro-Italion
front there have been only
bombardments.
Six British and two neutral steam
ers one of the latter a Norwegian and
the otherd Spanish have i;iet with
disaster as the result of mines and
torpedoes. Five of the vessels had been
in the American trade.
GERMAN NOTE ON
SINKING OF SHIPS

AnxiouslyAwaiting
News From Mexico
DESPATCHES INDICATE CONTACT
WITH VILLA TROOPS
rROOPS NOT LOCATED
Berlin, April 10, noon, via London.
April 11, 2.22 a. m. The German note
in response to the inquiries of the
American government regarding the check to them would be given. General
Assumed at Army Headquarters That
Cols. Dodd and Brown Are Riding
Hard Along Trails in Pursuit of Villa.
San Antonio, Texas, April 10. Des
patches from the front indicating con
tact with the Villa troops were await
ed with some anxiety at headquarters
today by General Funston, who real
ized fully the dangerous .position in
which the commanding officers of the
cavalry detachments beyond Satevo
had placed themselves.
Location of Troops Matter of Guesswork.
The exact whereabouts of the Amer
ican advanced columns pursuing Villa
in the vicinity of Parral was unknown
here and the difficulties General Persh
ing has had in communicating his
movements, has made it a matter of
guesswork as to whether another en
gagement had been fought.
Riding Hard Along the Trails.
It was assumed that Colonel Brown
and Colonel Dodd were continuir:
them hard riding along the trails
about Parral in pursuit of Villa, wno
was reported by Mexican officials to
have been in that district forty-eight
hours ago, but no reports indicatin;
their exact location were received dur
ing the day.
No Check to Activities.
General Pershing continued to carry
on the campaign without sign of lim
iting trie activities of his men and no
indication was evident here that any
dhannel steamer 'Sussex and the steam
ers Englishman, Manchester Engineer,
Eagle Point and Berwindvale will be
transmitted to the American embassy
tonight or Tuesday morning.
The note declares, as previously ca
bled, that the reports of the com
manders of submarines which might
possibly have been .involved in an at
tack on the Sussex make it absolutely
certain that the Sussex was not de
stroyed toy a German torpedo.
Likewise, Germany denies responsi
bility for the sinking of the other
steamers, evidence having been ad
duced at the investigation to show that
no blame attached to Germany.
FIRST SHIP AUCTION EVER
HELD IN UNITED STATES
BARNES ATTACKS FORMER
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
Attracted Crowd to the Maritime Ex
change, New York.
New York, April 10. Contracts for
the steamships under construction in
American yards were sold here today
at public auction on the floor of the
maritime exchange, instituting the
first ship auction held in the United
States. One contract calls for the de
livery in August of a motor tank
ship of 4,760 tons, now being built at
Baltimore, which brought $500,000. The
other calls for a freighter of 7,500 tons,
to be built at Seattle, Washn, for de
livery in July, 1917, which brought
1600.000.
A third contract for a tank ship of
4.760 tons, a duplicate of the first
named, building at Baltimore for de
livery in 1917, was withdrawn, after
being put up, because of no bids. Only
one bid each for the two ships sold
was offered, the names of the purchas
ers being withheld by the brokers in
charge of the auction at the request
of the owners.
It was understood, however, that
the purchaser of the first ship sold
was Max Straus, acting for a foreign
steamship line and that the second
was Morris Frankel, acting for the
Universal Transportation Company.
The novelty .of the sale attracted an
audience of several hundred men
prominent in shipping and ship brok
erage industries.
According to steamship men the
prices for the ships were considerably
under what they would have been had
the ships been ready for delivery.
COMMISSION OF INDUSTRIES
CONCERNED IN FRENCH TRADE
Will Oppose His Nomination for Presi
dency by Republican Party.
New York. April 10. William
Barnes, formerly chairman of the re
publican state committee, in a state
ment issued here today, attacked For
mer President Roosevelt and denied a
published report that he would not
oppose the nomination by the republi
can party of Mr. Roosevelt for the
presidency.
"This year, Barnes asserted, the
periodical candidacy of Mr. Roosevelt
for president of the United States is
based upon Americanism and. such
sporadic support as he is receiving
comes from his declaration in behalf
of proper national defense.
Mr. Roosevelt is not responsible for
any natural phenomenon, nor he has
a patent on the obvious. That this
country should be properly defended,
as it is not defended now, is not open
to debate.

REPUTES BETHMANN-HOLLWEG CLAIM
Premier Asquith Replies to Speech Recently Delivered
in Reichstag by German Chancellor
READY TO TAKE CONTROL
OF THE VILLA SITUATION
Statement Given Out by General Ga
briel Gavira of Juarez.
EI Paso. Texas. April 10. General
Gabriel Gavira, Carranza commander
at Juarez, tonight announced that the
forces of the de facto government were
in a position to take immediate con
trol of the Villa situation if the Amer
ican troops withdrew.
General Gavira's statement was
made in connection with the an
nouncement of Major General Hugh L.
Scott, chief of staff of the American
army office, that the purpose of the
expeditionary force would be consid
ered accomplished when the Villa
bands were dispersed or "as soon as
the troops of the de facto government
are able to relieve them of the work."
"We have more men than enough
now," said General Gavira. "If we
were able to overcome Villa when he
had 70,000 men, over a hundred can
non and plenty of supplies, we ought
to be able to dispose of him now, when
his numbers have dwindled down to a
few hundred. But it is a big terri
tory to operate in and a single man
has more chance to escape and hide
than a. large force would have. How
ever, on account of Villa's wounded
condition, we think he will be taken
in. If not, it is hardly likely that
without proper surgical care he will
survive long."

the sugar measure, which is a substi

Under an agreement reached Friday

turers, chief purchasers of dyes, he

Senator Smoot and Senator Brande-
gee urged the passage of the amend
ment, the former asserting that the

Is with this record that the chancel

he calls the long-suppressed Flemish
