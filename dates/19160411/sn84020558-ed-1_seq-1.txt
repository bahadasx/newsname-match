LONDON, April 10. On the occasion
if a government reception to visiting
diplomats at Lancaster house tonight,
Premier Asciuith took occasion to reply
to the speech recently delivered in the
reichstag by the imperial German
chancellor, Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg.
Those present included Karl Kitch
ener, the Marquis of Lansdowne, Sir
Edward Grey, J. Austen Chamberlain,
Sir Walter Kunciman, Lewis Harcourt,
Viscount Bryce, A. J. Balfour, and Lord
Robert Cecil. The premier in propos
ing the toast, "Our Guests," referred
to von Bethmann-Hollweg's claim to
readiness on the part of Germany to
negotiate peace, and said:
"The German chancellor wants us to
assume the attitude of a defeated to
a victorious adversary. But we are not
defeated and we are not going to be
defeated."
Reiterating that the ententes would
make peace on their own terms, Mr.
Asquith proceeded.
"The chancellor first misquotes my
language, then proceeds to distort its
obvious meaning and intention. Great
Britain and France entered the war not
to strangle Germany or wipe her off
the map of Europe; not to destroy or
mutilate her national life; certainly
not to interfere with, to use the chan
cellor's language, the free exercise of
"Tier peaceful endeavors.
"As a result of the war, we intend
to establish the principle that interna
tional problems must be handled by
free negotiations on equal terms be
tween free peoples, and that settlements
shall no longer be hampered or sullied
by overmastering dictation of a govern
ment controlled by a military caste.
That is what I mean by the destruc
tion of the military domination of
I'russia nothing more, but nothing
less."
Referring to the fate of Serbia and
Moniengro, the premier said:
"We are in this struggle, the cham
pions not only of treaty rights but of
the independent status and free devel
opment of weaker countries. In the
circumstances, cynicism could hardly
go. further than in the chancellor's
claim that it is for Germany of all
powers to Insist, when peace comes,
upon 'giving various races a chance for
free evolution along the lines of their
mother tongue and national individual
ity." Apparently this principle is to be
applied, I suppose, on approved Prus
sian lines both in Poland and Belgium."
Contending that the Poles have had
on illuminating experience of the Ger
man ideas of a free evolution Mr. As
quith continued:
"The attempt to Germanize Poland
has been for the last twenty years at
once the strenuous purpose and colossal
failure of Prussian domestic policy. No
body knows this better than the chan
cellor, for he has been one of Its prin
cipal instruments. '
"The wholesale strikes of Polish
children against the employment of the
German language, the barbarous flog-

President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing still are waiting both for the
communication from Berlin and for a
further information from other
sources. Much importance is attached
to an affidavit and evidence gathered
by the American embassy at Paris and
due to reach New York Thursday on
the liner Sf. Paul. It was learned to

I Without Pause, German
j Crown Prince Takes Ad
i vantage of Evacuation of
j Bethineourt Salient and
Starts Strong Offensive
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
Without pause, the German crown
prince, taking advantage ot the evac
uation of the Bethineourt salient by
the French and the occupation of that
position by the Germans, has thrown
several divisions against the new
French line, but so far has been un
able to break that line at any point.
The bombardment of the whole front
west of the Meuse is of increasing
intensity on both sides. Germans
moving down along the Haucourt
Btthincourt line attacked the French
position south of the Forges brook.
Here they had to face the full fury of
the French guns, which cost them
heavy losses.
The French front along the strategy
sector extending from Le Mort Homme
to Cumieres remained unmoved and
further attempts to takeit by assault
were arrested by the French curtain
of fire.
The French still hold their positions
in the Caillette wood, which has been
the scene of heavy fighting, and
against which German attacks have
been directed daily.
The last remaining mine crater tak
en recently by the Germans from the
British at St. Elio has been recap
tured by King George's men, who also
were able in their attack to establish
themselves in German trenches run
ning southwest from the crater.
From the Dvir.a river to the lower
Strip:! there has been sporadic fight
ing between the Russians and the
Germans.
Considerable activity by the airmen
of both sides also has been shown.
Near Komor, in the Pripet marsh re
gion, a German attack, launched by
means of boats,, broke down under
th Russian force, while on the lower
Stripa the Russians captured a Ger
man trench and held it against
counter attacks, inflicting heavy cas
ualties on the Germans.
In Asiatic Turkey the Russians have
penetrated to the region of Diarbek,
while in the district of Bitlis several
Turkish attacks have been repulsed.
South of Lake Frumiah region the in-
vnders apparently are coming up with
the Turkish main forces, the latest of-
by regular Turkish infantry.
In Mesopotamia the Biritsh, in their
attempts to relieve their compatriot
besieged at Kut-El-Amara, attemped
to break the Turkish lines hut failed,

munication. The floods are still badly
hampering the movements of the
British.
The Italians have penetrated ad
vanced Austrian trenches in the Ton-
ale road near Speron and have set on

front there have been
only bombardments.
Six British and two neutral steam
ers, one of the latter a Norwegian and
the other Spanish have met with dis
aster as the result of mines or tor
pedoes. Five of the vessels had been
in the American trade.

what he moans by "the destruction of

General Gavira Announces
Forces of De Facto Gov
ernment In Position to
Control Situation If Amer
icans Are Withdrawn
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
EL PASO, Texas, April 10. Gen
eral Gabriel Gavira, Carranza com
mander at Juarez, tonight announced
that the forces of the defacto gov
ernment were in a position to take
immediate control of the Villa sit
uation if the American troops with
drew. General Gavira's statement was
made in connection with the an
nouncement of Major General Scott,
chief of the American army staff,
that the purpose of the expeditionary
force would be considered accom
plished when the Villista bunds were
dispersed or "as soon as the troops
of the de facto government is able
to relieve them of the work."
"We have more men than enough
now," said General Gavira. "If we
were able to overcome Villa when he
had 70,000 men and plenty of sup
plies, we ought to be able to dispose
of him now when his numbers have
dwindled down to a few hundreds?
But it is a big territory to operate
m and a single man has more chance
to escape and hide than a large force
would have. However, on account of
Villa's wounded condition we think
he will be taken soon. If not, it is
hardly likely that without proper
surgical care he will survive for
long."
The arrival of General Hcrtani in
Juarez gave renewed force to the re
ports that General Gavira has been
ordcied to the field. Nothing was
learned of the whereabouts of Gen
eral Petronjllo Hernandez, who was
said to have been named as succes
sor to General Gavira and who was
expected to reach Juarez" today.
General Gavira said today that the
trials of the men implicated in the
plot to seize Juarez in the interest of
Feliz Diaz h:id been practically com
pleted. Interest in the pursuit of Villa and
the diplomatic situation at Washing
ton was largely diverted today, as
far as the border was concerned to
the reported raising of a new revo
lutionary standard by Gen. Salazar.
General Salazar, who has been- liv
ing here, was one of the best known
of the Huerta generals. He is be
lieved to have crossed the border
near Ojinaga after issuing a state
ment denouncing Carranza fpr bring
ing about "the invasion" of Mexico
by Americans and declaring his in
tention to defend the "sacred soil of
his native land.
Salazar enjoys the reputation of
being one of the ablest of the Mex
ican generals. It was reported here
today by men who have been closely
associated with him that he .intends
to declare for Feliz Diaz. It is known
that up to a short time ago Salazar
was iu the greatest poverty. He
complained bitterly that on account
of his "persecution" by Americans he
was forced to live on the charity of
friends. A few "days before his de
parture, however he received a large
sum of money and repaid several
debts he had incurred.
There are a number of Americans
here who were on intimate terms
with the vanished general, who was
willing to admit individual Americans
to his friendship wjiile never dis
guislng his hostility toward the
American government. These main
tain that Salazar has a very large
following in northern Chihuahua and
that hundreds, if not thousands ' of
the Carranza soldiers, who fought
under him in previous campaigns,
will gladly follow their old leader If
he summons them.
A story was current here tonight
that Salazar was in hiding in Juarez
but as this was hardly possible with
out the connivance of the Carranza
officials, it was not generally cred
ited.
Reports received here by American
mining concerns state that there "has
been extensive looting of stores and
warehouses in Parral and in towns
in that district. Some damage is
said t have been done to American
property but its extent is not known.
The looting is said to have been the
result of desperate conditions of the

'in a statement issued today, at

velt and denied a published re
port that he would oppose the

ty of Mr. Roosevelt for the pres

serted, "the periodical candidacy
of Mr. Roosevelt for president of

Americanism, and such sporadic
support as he is receiving comes
from his declaration in behalf of
proper national defense.
Mr. Roosevelt is not responsible
for any natural phenomenon nor
has he a patent on the obvious.
That this country should be prop
erly defended, as it is not de
fended now, is not open to debate."

Columbus Guard Increased
Suppressed Excitement At Quarters
Republican A. P. Leased Wire ,
COLUMBUS, N. M.r April 10. Increased precautions to guard the
military base at Columbus and the American line of communication, the
arrival of a number of strangers in town and what seemed to be an air
of suppressed excitement about military headquarters all contributed to
day to the belief that the authorities here belieye there are about to be
important developments in the punitive campaign in Mexico. Whether
these developments concern operations in the field or new steps to be
taken ir the United States looking toward the capture of Villa could not
be learned.
Because of the delay in communication due to the work of extending
the range of the wireless field station to a point in the vicinity of Sa
tevo, closer to the camp of General Pershing, no reports concerning the
progress of the advance in the American detachments were received to
day. It was expected, however, that communication would be reestab
lished during the night.

EL PASO. April 10. Elfego Rata,
one of the best known lawyers in the
southwest, formerly district attorney
in Socorro, N. M., and prominent in re
publican politics in that state, was ar
rested here tonight in connection with
the flight over the border of General
Salazar yesterday.
Eight Mexicans, all of whom have
played important parts in Mexican
politics at one time or another, were
arrested at the same time. Amonir
them were General Ignacio Morelos
Zaragoza, who was in command at
Tamptco under Huerta when the arrest
of American marines precipitated the
crisis which led to the occupation of
Vera Cruz, and General Marcelo Careve,
a former lieutenant of Orozco. All eight
are said to have been working in the
interests of Felix Diaz, a fact which
supports the theory that Salazar pro
poses to declare for that leader.
Baca has represented Salazar at the
latter's trials, for gun running con
psiracy against American neutrality
and perjury. In each case he succeeded
in having his client acquitted. After
his first arrest, Salazar escaped from
the jail in Albuquerque and made an
abortive attempt to start a revolution
in Sonora. Baca was indicted as an
accomplice in the escape but was ac
quitted, t
ISaca was later released after he had
been examined by secret service agents
as to his relations with Salazar. The
secret service men also searched his
room at the hotel where he was stop
ping but were unable to find anything
which would connect him with Salazar's
disappearance.

ment in the reichstag:
"I refrain from making any extend
ed statement to you on the military
situatiiin as the daily reports from
headquarters enable the nation to fol-
low the satisfactory developments of
military affairs on all the fronts. Our
army reports ure phrased with mili
tary brevity but, in contrast with
those of our enemies, they are always
true.
"A victorious country has no need
to make excuses. That we have been
victorious a glance at the map shows.
This our enemies also know, though
they do not admit it. That we shall
be victorious throughout until the
glorious end is guaranteed by the he
roism of the army, the united will" of
the people,, the moral strength of the
nation and an abundance of all things
necessary to carry on the war."
Speaking of the Verdun offensive,
the war minister said:
''These fire not, as our enemies pre
tend to belieye, the last efforts of an
exhausted nation but the hammer
blows of a strong unconquerable peo
ple provided with sufficient human
eserves and all necessary means of

will be repeated until our adversaries

Senator from New Mexico
After Personal Investi
gation of Conditions
Makes Sensational Report
to Officials In Washington
MEXICANS COULD
HAVE TAKEN VILLA
Says On His Retreat, Villa's
First Camp Was Within
Five Miles of Carranza
Soldiers Who Refused to
Attack Him
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, April 10 Sen
ator Fall of New Mexico, who, at
the request of republican senators,
went to the border immediately
after Villa's raid on Columbus to
" investigate general conditions
there, declared in a letter received
today by Senator Gallinger, the
minority leader, that Carranza
troops were not cooperating with
the American expedition in any
way or making any attempt to
attack Villa. He complained that
the border patrol was not being
maintained in adequate force, and
said an unguarded gap of nine
nviles had made the Columbus raid
possible.
The letter was written in El
Paso, April 14. It quoted an un
named authority as saying that
unless a more satisfactory use of
the Mexican railroads were made
possible within one week, the
American troops, must withdraw,
and said reliable information had
reached the senator that Villa had
not been wounded.
"The Mexicans," said the letter,
"have made no attempts to at
tack Villa at. all, and have not in
any way been cooperating with
our forces or attempting to check
Villa's retreat or to assist in his
capture. . On his retreat Villa's
first camp was within five miles
of 700 Carranza soldiers to whom
Ramon Reyes reported and whonv
he pleaded with to accompany him
to attack Villa's 300 men. The
Carranza force refused."
Describing in detail the Columbus
raid from information gathered from
Columbus officials, Senator Fall said
the bandits had made their way into
the heart of the town, looted two
stores, and set fire to several build
ings before an alarm was given. With
the aid of a machine gun placed
within 20 feet of the American army
hospital, he said, the Mexicans then
fought with the citizens of the town
for r.O minutes before the troopers,
stationed behind the hospital, ap
peared. The letter referred to the Mexican
trenVhes near the border facing the
border at Juarez and other border
towns. He said stories of concentra
tion of Carranza troops along the
border had been exaggerated, but that
he was reliably informed that tha
Carranza commanders could put S'H0
men into Agna Prieta. within five
hours and that virtually all the' Car
ranza troops in the state of Chihua
hua were stationed along the Mexican
central railway within one to ten
hours from Juarez.
"I. however, have absolutely no fear
of an attack from Mexicans," Senator
Fall added, "under any circumstances,
except through Indian tactics such as
pursued by Villa at Columbus or
w hore the Mexicans are in overwhelm
ing numbers.
The senator said that at the time ho
wrote there was no border patrol
west of Douglas, and had been none
between the Gibson ranch and Hachi
ta, 30 miles to the west. He declared
Villa sympathizers were overrunning
virtually all of northern Mexico and
that Villa easily could capture Chi
huahua, where the garrison was
friendly to him.
"In the Torreon, Parral and Santa.
Sosalia districts," sid the letter,
"Villa has many friends and one of
his leaders, Canuto Reyes, is said to
have 1500 armed men constantly cut
ting communications and threatening
the Garrison at Torreon."
The districts mentioned are amonj
those in which American troops now

It was assumed that Colonel Brown
and Colonel Dodd were continuing
their hard riding along the. trails about
Parral in pursuit of Villa, who was re
ported by Mexican officials to have
been in that district forty-eight hours
earlier.
General Pershing continued to carry
on the campaign without sign of lim
iting the activities of his men and no
indication was given that any check
would be made. So far as headquar
ters officials were informed, the Ameri
can troops are in Mexico to get Villa
and no one has told. them where to
stop.
