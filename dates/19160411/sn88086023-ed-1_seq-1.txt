WASHINGTON, April 11. The

Germany had denied attacking the

had denied ever promising not to tor

marine warfare against armed mer

the significance of the recent subma

lie states, and they have reason to
be because the festival association has
placed them under a handicap. Port-!
land merchants will not be permitted
to give out votes with purchases for
'he reason that this would be unfair
to the smaller cities, the volume of
business done by Portland merchants
being so much greater.
The Portland organizations must
pay cash for their votes at the rate
t a dollar a thousand. Pendleton
and other towns have the same privil
ega and. In addition, will have the
otes secured from the merchants.
The votes in the newspapers may be
last for any candidate without cost.
Mr. Richardson and the local com
mittee held a meeting this morning
and are holding another this after
noon. Their plan is to have the mer
chants purchase ballots at the rate of
a dollar a thousand and give so many
with a dollar purchase, the proportion
to be derided among themselves. How. I
ever, this will not prevent anyone I
else from purchasing votes outright
and casting them for the local candi
date. Valituble piiNUSty Idea.
j There are at present 10 candidates
I from Portland and seven from outside
j points. Besides Pendleton, the fol-
lowing cities have put up candidate?:
Kugcne. Albany, Salem Corvallls, Or
egon City and Klamath Falls, making
I a total of seven candidates outside ot
Portland
The candidate receiving the highest
I number of votes will be crowned
queen and. in addition, the city or or-
ganixatlon electing her will be prlvil
I eged to name the king of the testi
I val. The twelve next highest candi
dates will be maids or honor. Only
I six of these can come from Port
land, leaving sue of the seven other
! cities sure of representation.
I The Rose Fetival will provide a
j special float for every randidate out
. side of Portland and guarantee to
spend not less than 1100 on this float.
The float will be built to advertise

ports indicated that the desper

battle has narrowed to a three
mile front and has Increased ,
greatly la Intensity.
PARIS, April It, It Is officially
estimated that the oerman losses at
Verdun have been more than 100,000.
The Verdun line was still held today
under the most tremendous blow in
history. Wave after wave of Ger
mans were thrown agamst the line on
a six mile front northwest of the cit
adel. Twenty thousand Germans have
been killed or wounded In the last two
days The French losses were admit
tedly heavy it was announced that
three German corps have lost half
their total strength since the begin
ning of the battle.
Attacking with tTtruffr fire, the Ger
mans captured fragment of trenches
on a ridge east of Deadman's Hill last
night Elsewhere the Germans were
repulsed. Bloody figntlng resulted
from the Teuton attempt to recap
ture lost ground south of Douaumont.
They were heavily checked and
thrown into disorder. French artil
lery prevented the use of flame
throwers there. A terrific bombard
ment thundered at Douaumont, Vaux
and Woevre all night Artillery and
infantry fire routed the German who
were debouching from Crowds Woods.
The belief is growing that Verdun
will be saved if the French success
fully can resist this assault. The bat
tle hourly has grown more violent
since Saturday. It appears that it
soon will culminate in a grand Ger
man assault on both banks of the
Meuse
The Teutons charged Deadman's
Hill. In mass formation. They be
came confused and lost In the barren
ravines. When the unit were demor
alised, concealed French guns sud
denly opened fire. Tne attack halted,
wavered and then fell back Scores
of high explosive shells were dropped
on the huddled masses, biting great
holes in the confused crowds. Similar
bloody scenes were enacted between
Haucourt and Bethlncourt. On the
eastern side, however, tne ravines of
fered a shelter to the advancing Ger
mans and they captured a line ot
front trenches.
BERLIN, April 11. Thirty-six
thousand Frenchmen have been cap
tured since the beginning of the Ver
dun attack, it was semi-offlcially an
nounced. On the west bank of the
Meuse the Germans captured ten
square miles of territory and a larger
area on the east bank. Countering
the French statements that the evac
uation of Bethlncourt was a strategic
move, a semi-official news agency
published a copy of a french order
alleged to have been found on the bat
tlefield, urging the commanders to
hold Bethlncourt at all costs.
It was reported that the British
made grenade attack south ot St
Eloi. It was claimed the .ittack was
repulsed.
