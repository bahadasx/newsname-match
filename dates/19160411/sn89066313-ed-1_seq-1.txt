COUNCIL WOULD STOP
SfflPMHTOF LIQUOR
Files Petition for Injunction
Restraining Import by
Express Companies.
STATE OPPOSED, TOO
Other Missouri Counties Set
Precedent May Also
Enjoin Railroads.
Tin slate of Missouri ami the city
of Columbia todaj filed petitions in
the Circuit Court asking that an in
juiution be granted restraining the
Wclis-Uargo and American Express
Comp mics from delivering intoxieat
ni; liquor into Columbia City At
tornej George S Starrctt and Prose
cuting At tonic j W. M. Dinwiddic said
this afternoon that a petition would
probabl be filed asking a similar in
junction against the M K. & T. and
Wabash Railroads Judge Harris has
taken the petitions under advisement.
It is not known when his decision
will be rendered.
The petition came as a result of
action b the new Citj Council at its
first meeting last ntelit Citj At
torncj Starrett introduced the petition
in the council meeting, sajing that
.similar action had been taken in
Howard, Saline and Livingston coun
ties anil in the town of I'attonsburg.
The injunction was granted in all of
tlic-c places, and in only one place
Howard Count did the express com
panies fight the injunction. Here the
Circuit Court decision was against
tlitm. and the case was not carried to
the Missouri Supreme Court.
Major ltaltcrton Adds Vote.
A good ileal of discussion followed
the reading of the petition in the coun
cil meeting, some of the members
thinking that it might hac the same
frte as the cigarette ordinance of a
few months ago. When the matter
was put to a otc, however, everj- man
cited in fax or of asking for the in
junction, and Major J. M Batterton
arose and said that he also wanted to
t,o on record in fax or of it.
The til J 'a petition alleges thai there
are persons in Columbia pretending
to be keepers and proprietors of drug
stores and other place of business,
when in truth, they arc merelj- en
gaged in the illegal sale and delivery
of liquor The petition asks for a
permanent injunction; since it would
be some time before this injunction
tould be granted, it also asks that a
temporarj injunction be granted until
the hearing on the case can take
place
Starrett Certain of Case.
Mr Starrett lias been working on
this case for oer two months, he
said tod.ij He has made an investi-
gatiou of similar cases in the state
and is of the opinion that a permanent
injunction will be granted No Su
preme Court decision has ever been
rendered in a similar case in Missouri
for the reison that the express com
panies hate ncer carried the case
bej ond the Circuit Court.
It was taken to the Circuit Court
in onlj Howard County, and Mr. Star
rett sajs that the reason the express
companies fought it there was that
one injuiK tion was asked against
both the railroads and the express
companies which, to use Mr Star
rett s word-, was "erj bad pleading."
Here a separate injunction would bo
asked against the railroads if the
eit or state decides to go against them
also if no injunction is asked against
the railroads, it would still bo possi
ble for liquor to be shipped in by
freight without iolating the law. The
city council toted to ask injunction
against both the railroads and the ex
press, eoinpanics.

of preparedness. Kacli man lieie must
be able to take care of himself, and the
fellow who cannot do so or who is
phjsically unfit has a most imhappj
time
For tlie first few dajs of riding, 1
was sore in eveij- liber of mj bodv, but
I have rounded into shape and am
now feeling fine. Yesterday we had
somo snow Todaj is as hot as June

I have been vcij foitunate in being
assigned to the command of a most
excellent troop of men and horses
All are cheeifiil, resume fill and
j ii in it to work as the field hand to the
sound of the dinner horn. Enough of
this, however I am not aware as to
whether jou have a new commandant,
but, in anj- ev nt, keep on the job and

Dr. E. S. Ames Asserts that It Dis.
tinguislies Man From Animals.
Behavior distinguishes man from
other animals. He is not content
simply to eat tho food; he must have
a table cloth, liovveis and other re
finements. Rites and ceremonies
differentiate him, according to Edward
Scribner Ames, assistant professor of
philosophy at the University of Chi
cago, who spoke at Asseinbl) this af
ternoon. Man comes into this human
inheritance through the family group,
plaj ground group and neighborhood
group. He takes on his first relations
through his response lo plaj accord
ing to Doctor Ames.
"Man gets his ideals and ambitions
from tho family group; he learns to
play tlie rules of the game in tlie plaj--ground
group; public opinion is the
strongest force in the neighborhood
group," said the speaker.
The courts are becoming more hu
man in their methods of prtcedure,
and some of the big businesses are be
coming more human, according to
Doctor Ames. "For a long time we
nave ueen suspicious oi numau nature i
because we did not understand it," he
said. "It is now regarded as the fin
est flower of civilization."

In celebration of the famous state
man's birthda), the stone tablet bear
ing his epitaph which is the original
stone placed over his grave in Mon

the Jefferson monument on the West
Campus. The stone will remain there

This stone, which rested on his
grave in Virginia for more than fifty
j ears, was presented to the Univer
sity or Missouri bj the Misses Ran
dolph of Edge Hill, Va, at tlie solici
tation of friends in 1SS3. Prior to
the destruction of Academic Hall by

floor of the basement and broke into
several pieces. It has since been
mended with cement, and is inclosed
in a glass case in the University's
vault.
