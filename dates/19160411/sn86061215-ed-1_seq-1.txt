Paso, Tex., April 10.—In his flight

OFFICIALS HOPEFUL.
Washington, D. C., April 10.—Optim
ism for the early capture of Francisco
Villa pervaded official circles today
despite the fact that nearly a week has
passed since news of the operations of
the American troops in Mexico has
come to the war department.
Many officials were of the opinion
that important military developments
may have occurred and that it was im
possible for the extreme advancing
columns, last reported close on Villa's
heels near Satevo, to communicate
with their fleld base.
Ellseo Arrendondo, ambasasdor
designate of the de facto government
of Mexico, today received a telegram
from Mexico City advising him that
official notice has been given by his
government that no further contracts
will be made with foreign firms for
arms and ammunition, in view of the
fact that the recently established na
tional works are now capable of sup
plying the entire demand of the gov
ernment!
Overnight dispatches from Gen.
Punston to the war department made
public by Secretary Baker today were
summarized in the following state
ment:
"The latest dispatch from Gen.
Pershing, dated April 8, explains in
frequency of communication by saying
that the wireless has not been able
to work and aeroplane communication
has been difficult because of lack of
suitable landing places.
"The dispatch again confirms the
early report of Villa being severely
wounded in the right knee.
"Gen. Pershing reports that he has
had a very satisfactory conference
with Gen. Herrera and expects today
to meet Gen. Gutierrez, to whom he
sent messages by aeroplane to Chi
huahua and received replies offering
full cooperation. (Jen. Pershing's com
ment is that every indication shows
the desire of the troops of the de facto
government to aid to the extent of
their ability.
"Geni Pershing further reports that
one aeroplane was badly disabled in
landing April 6, leaving only five out
of the original eight now in service
able condition but it is evident, that
the aeroplanes in use are performing
valuable if not indispensable service
and that great reliance is placed upon
them."
Secretary Baker received word to
day that the railroad situation in
Mexico was much improved and that
supplies in increasing quantities were

ber over two hundred men, is reported
to be heading to Durango City. Det
tachments of the thirteenth cavalry
are hard on the bandit's trail, but no
official word has come from the front
to indicate their position. Mexican
reports stated today that Villa was a
full day ahead of his pursuers. If Villa
succeeds in reaching Durango City he
probably will be joined by the forces
of the Arrieta brothers, who command
over 1,000 men.
A statement attributed to Mexican
Consul Garcia that Villa has now
escaped any possibility of capture by
the Americans, having crossed a dead
line established by President Wilson
and CarranSa, beyond which it was
agreed that the American troops would
not continue their pursuit for the ban
dit, was flatly denied by Mr. Garcia.
The Mexican consul said as far as
he knew no limit of the American pur
suit had been agreed upon by the two
governments.
Mexican officials here will not dis
cuss a report that the de facto govern
ment will soon Inform the American
government that It is In position to re
lieve the American troops of the task
of chasing Villa. Mr. Garcia said he
had no information on matters of a
diplomatic character.
With Villa moving into Durango the
supply problem of the army continues
to the fore. Heavy shipments to priv
ate contractors In Chihuahua City
probably will be made from El Paso
In a few days. The tender of the use
of the telegraph and telephone lines
of the de facto government to Gen.
Pershing will be of Immense aid in
ordering and shipping supplies.
MEXICANS BEGIN
PURSUIT WILL END
EVIDENCE8 REACH WASHINGTON
THAT CARRANZA WANTS
S0LDIER8 TO RETURN.
Washington, D. C.( April 10.—State,
department dispatches today indicate
that officials of the Mexican de facto
government are viewing with some
anxiety the continued presence of
American troops in Mexico. One dis
patch authoritatively was described
today as containing a hint that cer
tain Mexican officials believed that the
purpose of the American punitive ex
pedition had been accomplished. This
belief was said to be based upon the
assumption that the bandits under
Villa have been dispersed.
Consul General Rodgers, it was
learned today, has advised the depart
ment that the de facto government
officials at Queretaro had intimated
to him they would like to know how
long the United States Intended to
keep the tfoops in Mexico. Adminis
tration officials In a position to be
familiar with the Mexican situation
said the de facto government had not
set a date upon which they thought
the American troops should be with
drawn. It was admitted in various
quarters, however, that such action by
the de facto government would not.be
surprising.
Secretary Lansing and Secretary
Baker both declined to. comment to
day on the reports.
Secretary Baker declared in answer
to questions that such an agreiement
would come under the pending proto
col and a subject not under the war
department's jurisdiction.
The proposed protocol of which
little has become known still Is under
discussion at Gen. Carranza's provi
sional capital, Queretaro.
At both the state and war depart
ments it was said nothing was known
of reports of massing of Carranza
troops on Gen. Pershing's rear. State
department dispatches located Villa
heading toward Parral.

GRANGE AGAINST
Wapello County Farmers to
Fight greater Iowa's
Road Movement
CALL IT BURDEN
ON THE TAXPAYERS
Dirt Roads, Graded and Well
Drained, Held to Be Good
Enough for Present
A largely attended meeting of the
Wapello county Pamona grange Satur
day afternoon at Odd Fellows hall, wai
addressed by Prof. Robert Jay of
Ames, on the subject of "Hog Cholera
and Vaccination." The professor is
an advocate of vaccination and he
pointed out to the members of the
grange, the desirability of making
their swine immune from the disease
which in past years has wiped out
millions of dollars worth of hogs.
Considerable opposition was de
veloped at the grange meeting to the
state-wide movement for county option
in the matter of road building and im
provement. The upshot of it was the
adoption of the following resolution:
Whereas, the grange of Iowa, both
state and subordinate, has always tak
en a decided stand in favor of good
roads, and
Whereas, we believe that the well
graded, well dragged and well drained
dirt road, with permanent bridges, is
the most expedient and suitable road
in the state of Iowa at the present
time, and wlll remain as such for many
tears to come, and
Whereas, there are at the present
time certain self-appointed commit
tees and associations throughout the
state of Iowa, who are urging the en
actment of a law which will give the
proper authorities the power to bond
the taxpayers of Iowa to the extent of
forty million dollars, or more, for the
purpose of building hard surfaced
roads, and
Whereas, "the majority of the mem
bers of these committees and associa
tions do not pay any road tax, and that
the burden of paying for these bonds
will be placed upon the farmers of
Iowa, be it therefore,
Resolved, that we, the members of
Wapello county granges, in session as
sembled, do hereby protest against
the enactment of such a law and
pledge ourselves to use our best ef
forts to defeat this movement and
also use our influence to secure a bet
ter expenditure of the road funds un
der the present road system, and be it
further
Resolved, that a copy of these reso
lutions be given to the Ottumwa daily
papers and the Des Moines Register
I and Leader, for publication, and that
a copy be placed on file with the sec
retary of the Wapello county Pomona
grange.
Adopted at Ottumwa, Iowa, on the

Another result of Saturday's meet
ing of the grange was the organiza
tion of the Wapello County Farmers'
Tax league. It will be the purpose of
this league to get speakers who are
thoroughly posted on matters of taxa
tion, to explain to the fanners the
intricacies of the tax laws. The lea
gue will study the matter of taxes for
the purpose of assuring themselves
that they are being fairly treated and
that proper use Is being made of the
money that they pay into the author

George Guthrie of Kirkville, was
elected chairman of the league, and he
was authorized to appoint chairmen in
each township of the tfonnty. The
league is designed to h%ve branches
