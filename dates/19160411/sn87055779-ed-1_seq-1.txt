Hoys Confess.
According to the confessions of the
boys and the property found in their
possession they have been responsible
for practically all of the automobile
accessory and garage robberies
committed in South Kend during the
past year and a half. Tools, horns,
automobile blankets and accessories
of every description are in he
possession of the police.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon 4t
thefts from automobiles which have
been committed during the last IS
months had been cleared up. accord
ing to Chief Kuespert. The property
stolen in these 4 robberies had
either been identified by the owners
or through the reports kept on file
at the polite depart men .
In all 0 robberies are known to
have been committed by the gang of
thieves, as stolen goods from as
many places have been identified by
owners.
For over a year the police depart
ment has been attempting to get
träte of the thieves who have been
: L'-aling tool " boxes. robes, horns,
clocks and other automobile ap
purtenances. Monday afternoon
Sergt. William Harnhart and John
I'allo of the detective department
went tt) the home of Koss Imdgraf.
There they found a great amount f
sttden property and indications that
a number of persons were impli
( ated in 'the robberies.
Immediately Chief Kuespert de
tailed every man on the detective
force to work upon the case. All
night long the men searched the
I nine of the boys under arrest, each
place finding evidence which led
them to othet homes. At o'clock
Tuesday morning half a dozen of the
alleged thieves were at the city jail
and telling stories, of the robberies.
PioHity round in Slu'd.
Much of the property .was found
ip a shed in the rear of the home of
Glyde Landgraf, while t is asserted
that Dewey Woolman, who operates
'' small garage on Lland av., has
been buying the stolen property
from the boys. Woolman is under
arrest along with Ross Iandgraf. on
charges of receiving stolen property.
The boys admitted stealing goods
from the lockers at the high school
building and other property from
the Y. M. C. A. Thee robberies
have been a puzzle to the police de
partment and other officials for
months, as no träte of the thieves
could ever he secured. They als'o ad
mitted entering a number of gar
aces and stealing much cf the prop
erty that has been taken from au
tomobiles left standing along the
streets.
It is believed that very little of
the property has been disposed of.
Practically all of it was of such a
nature as not to be easily sold, al
though the police find many piece
of tool kits and other such outfits
missing. Thus far it has been abso
lutely impossible to mike up any
list of the robberies ir which th

Interrmtiona I News Serviee:
WASHINGTON. April 11. There
is every indication in war depart
ment circles today that immediate
reinforcements will be sent into
Mexico to strengthen Gen. Persh
ing's forces in pursuit of Pancho
Villa. The news that Villa and his
I audits hav e eluded their American
pursuers and dashed 00 miles ahead
into Dyrango added to the rave
concern felt by army officers.
It was realized that more and
more of (rem Pershing's command
mus-t be withheld from the head of
the column to guard the all-important
line of communications. With
Villa now 5 miles ahead of his pur
suers, and (Jen. Pershing unable to
1 lace much dependence upon the
.Mexican railroads in maintaining his
communications, seasoned veterans
today declared that the chances of
running down the outlaw with the
present American forces 'daily grow
more remote.
(Jen. Scott, chief-of-staff, stated
today that there are left along the
border approximately l.5o troops.
As the number stationed along the
border and sent there since th
chase for Villa was begun was about
'.C'.OOO, it is believ ed there are about
1", 000 now in -Mexico. Hy far the
largest part of those are guarding
the line of communication between
Columbus. N. M.. and (Jen. Persh
ing's field bases.
The next step probably will be to
withdraw some of the American
forces now patrolling the Mexican
border anti send them dow n through
Chihuahua to strengthen Pershing's
ever-lenuthening lines. The report
ed declaration of (Jen. Jose Ynez
.Salazar, former Iluerta commander,
that he will take the field against
the American invaders, lias caused
no little concern. Likewise, the
probable juncture soon in Duration
of the Villa forces with those of
(Jen. Canuto Keyer has brought the
seriousness the plight of (Jen.
Pershing's command home to offi
cials here in its full seriousness.

lost nearly 150. oon men in killed and
wounded.
West of the Meuse river about 2f
square kilometres of territory have
been captured.
("Jerman newspapers now point out
that the French report having eva
cuated Kethincourt. "according to
a previous plan." However, in this
connection it is pertinent to point to
an order found upon a French officer
which says:
"This important place ( Kethin
court must be held under all cir
cumstances." The fart that noire than TOO un
wounded French prisoners were tak
en and many more than that were
killed or wounded is proof that thei
French plan of evacuation could not!
have been perfectly carried out.
