tion over Mexican land lines of the
position of the American troops.
Apparently the rush of the Amer

so rapid that it has carried Oolonel
Dodd and Colonel Brown with their
troopers far beyond all lines of
communication. Army officers at
Fort Bliss believe that when the
expeditionary commanders get in
touch with General Funston they
will report that, the American
troops have engaged the Villa
forces in battle. Reports that a bat
tle lias been fought with Villa bands
south of Satevo arc current, but
there is nothing to confirm them.
