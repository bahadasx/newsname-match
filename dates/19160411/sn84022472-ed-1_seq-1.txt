The guards instructed In" the art of
fire fighting for just such ttn emer
gency, did effective work In directing
their unexpected reinforcements from
the labor gangs. These men. mostly
Italian laborers, worked without the
knowledge that within a few feet were
i stored enough explosives to blow them
into, eternity should the fire by an
chance become communicated to the
: interior of the unpretentious ' little
' houses. '' ' ,
In the section, toward which the fire
was sweeping are located hundreds of
tons- of -explosives stored for the use
of the company in its manufacture of
Cartridges. . Most of , these- magazines
are sunk in the ground and 'covered
with., sod on which there Is dry grass

That there was danger that the sev-;

I with possiMe loss of life among the
;mn employed there as well as heavy
property damage in Bridgeport and
vicinity- due to the concussion, was
admitted by the guards after the fire.
The .automobile1 chemical engine at

j command of Capt. . Inches, were called
'but their apparatus stalled in a sand
vjhill Just below the line of fire and by
jthe time they had it in motion -again
the fire was almost extinguished, -I
The fire broke out at the foot of the
-hill, Just northwest ' of the line which
separates the park at that point from
jthe town farm. An Inmate of Lake
view home on his way along the road
which skirts the , park at this point
saw two guards come over the brow
.of the hill and saw- them stop when
half way down.; Both" lighted pipes -or
Jeigarettes.. About a quarter of an
hour later a brisk fire,, fanned by -the
wind which was blowing in tha.t direc

right of where the fire started there Is
timber ands undergrowth. , The fire
.took good hold there and soon the
(brush was converted into hundreds of
'standing torches.
' A guard patrol of' two men discov
ered the fire and after making vain
attempts to halt it they sent word to
Curporal John Wagner. He in turn
telephoned to the guard headquarters
for .id- and. in the meantime started
to get in communication with all the
guards about the iark; calling them
to come and help "fight the fire. Be
cause of the direction of the wind the
fire was at first burning away from
the magazine which .Is located in an
other section of timber to the left of
where the blaze first started and Just
i.iider the hill. i.
As the flames spread however, they
communicated to the dry grass and
mounting the crest of the hill, spread
slowly downwafd toward the powder
magazine. This Is one of the new
magazines established recently, " the
company since the explosion of. sev
