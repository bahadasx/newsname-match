Americans Should Await Sus
sex Facts, Opinion Among
Germans.
By CARL W. ACKERMAN.
BERLIN. April 11. Much bitterness
has been caused here by reports that
Americans are questioning- tho honor
of the German government, without
waiting for the presentation of all
the facts In the Sussex and other
cases.
Tho Berlin newspapers today re
printed several American newspaper
editorials as cabled from English
sources, Thcso editorials charged that
Germany has violated the pledges
given by Ambassador Bcrnstorff.
It Is tho unanimous opinion of all
Germans with whom I have talked
that the U-boat commanders have re
ceived such explicit Instructions that
there is llttlo possibility that they
havo violated either International law
or the pledges Germany gave America.
For that reason tho Germans feel
that the American editorials, written
before Germany presented her side of
thn case. r antlralv unfair.
The final draft of tho Germatucaply-
to I'resiaent- wuaon s inquiries, re
garding' the Sussex. 'and the four
freighters, has been approved by
Chancellor von Bethmann-IIoUwesr
and Admiral von Holtzondorff. It will
be transmitted to Ambassador Gerard
for forwarding- to Washington within
a few hours.

Say Use of Buildings as Pro
vided Would Not Conflict
With Educational Features.
Declaring their entire sympathy with
tho purposes of the proposed legisla
tion, the Commissioners sent to Con
gress today a favorable' report on the
Johnson-IIollls bill to provide for the
uso of publlo Mhool buildings In the
District as community forums.
The bill .requires tho Commissioners
to designate a limited number .ot
school buildings for use as community
forumo and to fix the territorial limits
of the forums.
The Commissioners say that whllo
they have no objection to this work,
neither have they any objection to so
amending tho bill as to Impose this
duty on the Board of Education,
. Wouldn't Conflict.
"The use of public school buildings
as authorized by this bill Is not in
tended in any manner to Interfere or
conflict with tho primary and essential
character and purposes of tho public
schools," the Commissioners say, "but
Is intended solely to Increase the use
fulness of tho buildings by making
them available as community meeting
places for the public education ot the

"Legislation looking toward the full

Presbytery Admits
Trio of Skeptics
New Ministers Declare Disbelief
in the Immaculate Concep
tion and the Resurrection.
NEW YORK. April ll.-That Prosby
terlan ministers In New York mav dls
believe In the Immaculate Conception,
and also in the Resurrection nt r-hrit
has been established by an overwhelm
ing vote of the New York Presbytery.
The Issue aroac in connection with
the admission to the ministry of three
candidates. Two, Earl Lcroy Douglass,
of Pennsylvania, and Rudolph Kasta
ncck, of New York, declared, both orally
and ln writing, their skepticism In re
gard to the virgin birth of the Savior.
The third, Edmund B. ChatTee, was
equally outspoken and emphatlo in re
punlatlng Ihe doctrine that Christ rose
from the tomb. All three wore from
Union Thenloglcal 8emlnary.
It was not without strong protet that
the skeptical students were admitted to
the ministry. Tnere Is an Impression
that the general assembly will take
more drastic action this vear In an
effort to restore the traditional stand
ards of belief. Among the ministers
who favored the admission of the can
didates wna the Rev. Dr. Henry M.
Tyndall.
"They are young," he said. "Their
doctrinal ocllefs have not yet gotten
their growth. Wo can safely assumo
that they will grow in conviction as
thev grow In experience."
The youn? men were questioned at
great length In secret session. The vote
on admission rtood 61 to 3.

Anti-Roosevelt Republican leaders In
Congress are buslty engaged ln trjlng
to And out the temper of the delega
tions and prospective delegations from
the Western States to learn If possible
to wnaf extent they can bo depended
on to oppose Roosevelt at Chicago.
Tho man upon whom these antl-Rootc-
vrlt leaders talk most of combining Is
Justice Hughes. It Is taken for granted
that Justice Hughes will not put himself
beyond tho pale of nomination, although
many politicians think he will eventual
ly eliminate himself.
But regardless of that, the Eastern
anti-Roosevelt leaders have gone far
enough to learn that they are llkoly
to nnv trouble In attempting to shift
Western delegations to any Eastern
candidate other than Roosevelt; that
a lot of the Western delegates will
olmoit certainly flock to the cojpnol;
and that it will be r6 easy thing to
keep a majority of the convention
from him
What the anti-Roosevelt leaders
figure on Is this: To allow a brief
period for the delegates to vote for
favorlto sons and to discharge their
primary or convention obligations,

BY MISS GUM
Henderson's Accuser Takes
Issue With Testimony Re
flecting on Her Character.
SAY SHE REFUSED TO WORK
Heart Balm Seeker Quoted as
Saying She Planned to Live
on Beauty.
BANGOR, Me., April 11. Arguments
aro expected to be begun this afternoon
In the 2SO.OO0 breach of promise case
of Elizabeth Garmong, of Iowa and
Bangor, against John B. Henderson, of
Washington, D. C. ,
Following a recess at 10 o'clock this
morning, Mr. Henderson was recalled.
The plaintiff, unabashed, heard Hender
son solemly declare yesterday after
noon that he never talked of marriage
in any way with hor, say it was not
true, as she charged, thati at their
final meeting he told her to "take her
baby to hell or throw it out of the
wndow," and beard him swear that she
had told him that sho had been born to
get man Into trouble.
Mr, Henderson told of making lir
loans and refusing payment, as the sums
were to him Insignificant, and of agree
ing through an attorney to pay her fPOO
to stop communication with him, to be
paid In four Installments. The flrt was
paid, but the others were withheld as she
persisted in annoying him. Then ho told
her to go ahead and sue, and he added
that he engaged a Washington detec
tive, Morgan Bradford, to unearth Miss
Garmong'a entire past.
Previous Testimony Read. .
Mrs. Mary Spear, by Illness prevented
from testifying at this term, had her last
trial testimony read, telling of Miss
Gormong's sojourn at Mrs. Spear's
boarding house In Bangor, in which sho
was placed by Mrs. Johnson, Bangor
city missionary. Mrs. Spear declared
that Miss Garmong told her that Hen
derson was an honorable man, tho only
one In all her lit she had been unable
to lead on, and that she despised him
for It She added that Dr. Smith was
a man of her own heart, full of fire and
passion.
ro! lowed the testlmonv of Mrs. Flora
Davis, a Washington milliner who kept
lodgers In 1910. In December of that
year Miss Garmong applied for lodg
ings for tho night. In the night a
baby's cries were heard and Mrs. Davis
nnd her husband, so sho said, dls
coered that Miss Garmong had smug
gled her child Into the house ln her suit
case. Sho staved nt the Davlses' for
some time, and Mrs. Davis said that
Miss Garmong, ahortlv before her exit,
declared that she wouldn't work.
"Why should I. God gave me form.
beauty, and passion, and I Intend using
them." she was quoted by tho wltnes
as saying.
Mrs. Johpson. city missionary of Ban
gor, then repeated her testimony, sub
stantially, of a year ago. principally
dealing with the alleged ntorv of Miss
Uarmong's narration of affalri. dls
closurcs of her methods of dispensing
delicacies and disseminating her ethics
and sex code.
None Leaves Court Room.
No women left the court room during
the testlmonv.
Tho records of Henderson's trial fol
lowing lib arrest on the Illegal pater
nity chutgci and subsequent acquittal,
were read and alloncd to go to the
Jury.
Flatly denying every allegation ln
anv way unfavorable to her and her
action, MIhb Garmong was recalled In
rebuttal after tho conclusion ot Hen
derson's re-cxamtnatlon. To tho ques
tion as to whether she discussed the
adoption of hor baby with tho Davis
family, she replied with hauteur,
"What, my baby adopted by a wtfman
nithnegrq blood?"
Mrs. Davis, sitting almost directly ln
front or Miss Garmong, smiled very
broadly. Mrs. Davis Is a decided blond,
with unusually regular white features.
.MIih Garmong denied ln toto every
allegation made by Mrs. Johnson, the
city missionary, and, with Indignation,
denied that Mrs. Johnson ever said:
"If your stories are true you ought to
b cnTbroformed."
Dr. Smith's deposition was riddled by
Miss Garmong, and In reply to nf&ny
unprintable statements ascribed to her
ny Mrs. Johnson and other witnesses,
Miss Garmong branded them as aoso
lute falsehoods.
