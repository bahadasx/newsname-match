lin.iii regiment that succeeded
I'insk, Russia, April 11. Though the
average German soldier has the high
est respect for the fighting qualities of
his Kngllsh and French opponents, it Is
the Russian, according to officers sta
tioned in the east, who emplovs strate
gy ajid cunning to an unexampled de
gree. There are almost as many stories
of Ilussian cleverness going the rounds
as there are officers who have met
with it.
In the great German drive eastward,
according to Lieut, von D . the Get-
mans and Russians finally took up their
positions respectively on the west and
east banks of a river. The Ilusslans j
were not taking their defeats with i
equanimity, and on every posslDle occa
sion were disposed to develop counter
offensive movement!.
Through underground channels the
Germans learned that the Russians in
tended, at night, to recross the bridge
which, undestroyed, spanned the river,
and attempt to surprise their rivals.
ine Germans in consequence very care
fully and quietly destroyed one small
section of the bridge nearest them, leav
ing a slight gap, and lay in wait for
the Russians.
The night was fairly dark, but not so
dark but that the Germans could see as
the Russians suddenly turned a big,
unharnessed horse loose at their end
of the bridge, and with a few whip
lashes started him at a gentle canter
toward the German lines. Puzzled Ger
man riflemen, lying In hiding, Vlth
held their fire as the animal' advanced
steadily toward them.
Horse Discovers Trap.
In a moment or two the horse reached
the gap in the bridge and, with tho
instinct aiiu Keener sigm at mgnt pos
sessed by animals, stopped and peered
at the dark water flowing past. lie
paused only a moment, then tnrnee
bout and trotted back to tbe Russian
lines. The; Russians made jf. attack
uiii nigHS, i
At a number of points the Germans
haws adopted, what Is a very old pre
caution for giving warning of the ap
proach or the enemy the stringing of
empty bottles on a wire around their
positions Which clink and jangle when
anyone approaches and stumbles onto
the wire. Unfortunately the bottles
know neither friend nor foe, and clink
when German sentries scouting at
night strike tbe wire.
Formerly It was the custom of such
German -sentries to shout out Instantly
the password or parole of the day so
that other sentries behind the bottle
strur.tr line should know that friends
were approaching and should not shoot
their own men down. But Russian
cunning again intervened to make even
this hazardous.
, Russians Get Password,
The Russians, it wan found, sent out
little squads numbering at least one
man with a knowledge of German.
These squads would then conceal them
selves In the marsh grass, allow Ger
man sentries to pass unmolested, and
then listen carefully for tho password
when it was shouted out by those
stumbling into the wire.
Possessed of the password, the Rus
sian squads then would approach the
German lines bodil, disarm suspicion
by giving tho parole correctly, and In
flict at least slight damage before van
ishing in the dark.

IIEN the early hours of Tues
day morning were still gray
and untlnged with the flashes
of a rising sun. three men, alleged con
spirators to deliver Juarez to a new
revolutionary movement, were marched
wth a detachment of Carranza soldiers
to the ancient cemetery to the south
west of Juarez and were shot
The three men condemned to die had
confessed that the originators in the
plot to turn over Juarez were in El
Paso.
"Plenty More In Cunrtel."
Tbe three men to be executed were:
Florencio Hernandez, a former Viilista;
Nicolas Chavvarea anvl Jose Ynez Bo-
rueL who were characterised by Gen.
Gavira as being reactionaries. "There
are plenty more of the conspirators in
the cuartel." said Gen. Gavira Tuesday
morning, while discusslnij the execu
tion, "but 1 think we have the .three
leading iqrtrttP u the rTrlTMIHr "Tf"
we have not jrot the ring leBflgMJ be
cause the ringleaders, are oa tbe Amer
ican side."
The three men were informed of
I . II. A. Dargue and K. S. Gorrell, of
the army aero corps, arriving here
from the front today, after one of the
most spectacular long distance flights
of the campaign, said that the report
current among natives in the vicinity of
Santa Ana, 70 miles to the southwest of
Chihuahua city, is that Villa is dead
of blood poisoning, caused by his
wounds.
Military authorities realize that the
report of the bandit chieftain's death
may be a ruse, to throw the Americans
off what has been termed a "hot trail."
but, nevertheless, the fliers said, no
tendency is manifested to belittle the
report
"There seems no doubt that Villa
was wounded," said one of the filers.
"Conversations with natives and with
physicians have convinced me that he
was shot through both legs, one of
them being broken by a bullet, while
another shot lodged In his stomach. A
man in that condition, without medical
attention could scarcely live long."
The aero corps planned to send an
aviator today to scout over the region
in which the natives have reported
Villa was buried in an attempt to find
the grave, the fliers said.
Villa, provided he is living, was last
reported to Gen. Pershing In the vi

Break Up Bandit Bands.
The American force is attempting to
break up and annihilate every one of
the small bands into which the bandit
command has broken, according to the
aviators. The small bands have con
stantly harassed American columns,
sniping now and then but without
avail.
"flight on Bandits" Heels."
"We are right on the heels of Villa's
rear guard, that of the band in which
the leader himself was reported to be
traveling and reports of a clash are ex
pected momentarily at headanarters."
one of the aviators said.
"However, this rear guard, consisting
of about 409 men. Is about one day
march behind the vanguard, consisting
of 108 of the 'Golden Ones.' Villa's
picked body guard.
. "The mayor of Guerrero, a Mexican,
who is very friendly to the American
troops, told me yesterday that a small
band, numbering about 106 men was
still lurking In the vicinity of the town
and since we have a force operating in
that neighborhood I anticipate that
those two forces will clash either today
or tomorrow."

"German newspapers point out that
the French now say Bethincourt was
evacuated in accordance with plans
previously made. Nevertheless It has
been ascertained that an order was is

" This important place must be held
in all circumstances.' The fact that
more than 700 unwounded French pris

losses in killed and wounded was
greater. Is proof that the French plan
of evacuation could not be carried out
as intended.
Av-oconrt Fortifications Destroyed.
"According to French reports,- the

of Avocourt wood along the first slopes
of hill No. 304, thence along the south

BRITISH TROOPS DELIVER
GRENADE ATTACK; FAIL
Berlin, Germany. April 11. British
troops made a strong hand grenade
attack Monday night after intensifici
artillery preparation against the Ger
man positions south of St. Elol, near
Ypres. but the attack was reDUlsed
and the iiositiou Is firmly held by the
ecution After thoroughly establishing
the guilt of the three men and secur
ing their outright confession. Gen. Ga
vira gave orders that the three men
be shot Tuesday morning at 3 oclock.
Uxeeutlon Is Prlvnte.
No one outside of the military knew
of the execution. It was kept very
quiet, as Gen. Gavira wished as little
excitement in connection with the car
rying out of the sentence as possible.
At 4 oclock a detachment of the militia
from the 27th infantry drew up in front
of the flmrtpl smH th Ihrfm iiriBntiM,

Six other prisoners Implicated in tho
plot, but whose connection was not
considered as prominent, were also
taken with the detachment to witness
the tragedy so that they might know
what a terrible penalty had been In
voked, and that they might know the
consequence of a continued disloyalty.
Down the darkened street tho sol
diers, with their condemned men,
passed. The beating of the drums was
subdued, for Juarez slept. The passage
of the feet was slight, for the com
plete group did not number more than
75 men. There were rio automobilos
with onlookers, and onlv the car In
which were the officers who supervised
the execution, was on hand as a wit
ness to the sunrise event.
HernnmleK First Tit Die.
The three men died quietly and un
eventfully. None sought the bandaged
eyes, even their hands were untied and
thev stood against the bullet marred
wall of the cemetery-hut. Hernandez
was first to win death. Tho other
two stood tragically by and waited
their turn. Then came Chavarrea, a
youngster with considerable of the
bravado in his movement, oven to the
end. He smoked uptb the last and
stoically threw aside his clgaret butt
It glowed a small red spot In the

shot back the sunlight glow. It was to
reveal a new daj and three silent
forms, their heads laid open with the
final crash of the mercy shot Their
hands, which had gripped at the soil
with agon. had relaxed, their bodies
had grown cold. The cemetery keeper
came along, the bodies were drawn
over to an open hole and buried.
Along the fence were the women of
the three men s household Th.- ,-
