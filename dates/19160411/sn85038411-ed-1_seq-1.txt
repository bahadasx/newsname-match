FRIENDS ALREADY THERE
Plans to Study French Methods)
of Military Training and
Practice
Jackson llerr Boyd, son of the late
John Y. Boyd, of this city, will sail j
April 22 on the Chicago, an ocean liner 1
plying between Now York and Bor- I
deaux, France, as a member of the j
American Ambulance Hospital Corps
j'or active service in that country.
Although uncertain as to the exact |
nature of the work, Mr. Boyd is keenly >
anxious to accomplish what good he I
may in the splendid work that is being j
done by so many young American col
lege and university men on the French
j front. As a corporal of an eight-man
squad at Plattsburg last summer he :
! absorbed much first-hand knowledge j
i of the requirements of military serv- i
i ice that will unquestionably stand him .
in good stead in the work that he has
, undertaken in the interest of the ,
Allies.
To Study French Methods
The presence in France in this line 1
of service of many of his friends has I
done as much as' anything to persuade j
this ardent supporter of the principle j
i of "preparedness" to east his lot with |
them, and it is his purpose to make a i
detailed study of the French methods
of training and military action, which \
i will be of inestimable value to the ; j
i cause of preparedness in this country :
I in so far as he will be able to con
; tribute to it. For a long time he has ,
I been intensely interested in the "proper
i preparedness" propaganda and re- \
cently exerted hi* Influence in creating
popular interest in the Plattsburg
training euinp idea among the students
I of the llarrisburg Academy, many of
! whom luive signified their intention of
i attending the splendid outdoor tented
city where they will be carefully in
structed in the school of the soldier.
Air. Boyd has enlisted for a period
of six months, and if the war continues
after that time he may or may not,
1 continue in active service with the '
j ambulance corps. Some of the young '
j drivers arc naturally subjected to some
! danger in the course of their missions '
of mercy from the front to the hos
pital. but there have been compara- !
tively few fatalities in this branch of 1
i the service.
A Princeton Graduate
Jackson llerr Boyd is a graduate of.
Prinoeton University and for several ,'
years has been active in the interests '
of his father's estate, lie was but re
cently elected a director of the Dau- ]
phin Deposit Trust Company and has
other interests in this city. Very ath
letic in build. Air. Boyd's activities
have kept him out of doors, with the
result that he is the ideal type fo*- the
1 sort ol work in which he is so in- j
terested. The richness of the experi- i
ence which he is about to en.ioy has'l
filled him with enthusiasm for the j
project, and. judging from his success \
and popularity in the things which he
has undertaken in college and out of
it. llarrisburg will be represented at
the front by one in whom it may take:
u just pride. Air. Boyd will take up I
his duties as a soldier with the knowl
edge that he has the best wishes and
hopes of good fortune from his many
friends in this and other eities in his
venture into the war zone, in his ab
scnce his brother, James Boyd, who
arrived from the South to-day. will

President Wilson and the cabinet

Secretary Lansing reported that he
expected to receive soon a dispatch

results of Germany's investigation into

j Cabinet members agreed thai in
I view of Germany's disclaimer of re
sponsibility for the Sussex it may bo

alone but Secretary* Lansing is con

1 The German disclaimer cannot, the
administration is convinced, clear up
the grave situation brought on by re
cent attacks as the evidence at hand
indicates illegal submarine operations.
An announcement of the attitude of
the Washington government is not
looked for until after Friday's cabinet

German note and information sought
from various sources will be at hand.
It is fully expected that some definite
