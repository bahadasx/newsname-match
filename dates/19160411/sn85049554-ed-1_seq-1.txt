Franolaoo Villa la dead and burled.
Theee reporta are under Inveetiga
llon.
Mexloana who had eeen Villa on
hie flight south said that the bandit
looked thin and sickly a week ago.
Reports, however, are conflicting.
Ono fairly good authority stated
that Villa was able to walk the
first Jay after he reoelved his
wound, wfileh Indicates that no
bones woro broken.

porta were represented as having: come
^(nn Queretaro, General Carransa's
provisional capital. They were un
substantiated by the latest dispatches
to the war, and state departments.
ftp- The report of Villa's recent Injury,
however, and the rigors of Ills long
and hurried flight. In which he has
been variously reported as being car
ried on a litter, on tfio shoulders of his
men, or In a carriage over rough trails,
gave color to the possibility that the
.:**.• bandit chief may have been unable to
fa-.
survive the hardships of/the flight.
i*v Large Force on Border.
Official estimates of the number of
troOps In Mexico and on the border
available for emergency were given at
e,T* the war department today. General

18,646 troops now constitute the border
patrol.
Oeneral Pershing has about 12,000
men In Mexico, including those holding
bis line of communication.
%-i* How greatly tfce mobile army has
been drawn upon was also disclosed by
General Scott He estimated that only
4,000 troops remain In the United
States not engaged on the border.
The only troops remaining at itrray
posts are the Second cavalry, divided
