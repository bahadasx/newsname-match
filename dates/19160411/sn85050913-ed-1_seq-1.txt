ME. LEONARD INTERVIEWED
Some Interesting Facts About Horses
v*v
«1
Shipped to War-Bidden
Europe.
Of the billions of dollars worth of
-i
war munitions and food stuffs ex
ported front thp .United States, to the
war-ridden dountries of Europe dur
Ihg the past year and a half, Iowa
has figured prominently with large
shipments of provisions and horses.
In a recent interview with .the
senior member of the firm of Leon
ard & Carson, horse dealers- In this
city, inuch interesting information
was gleaned upon the horse Indus
try of the country which, heretofore
has been little exploited. It Is an
interesting fact that these gentle
men ship $ greater number of horses
to the Chicago market than any oth
er one firm |n Iowa. Their ship
meiits from January first have'total
ed eleyen,,hundred head and owing to
tlie varying market during the last
three months the business has, not
beetfi up .to the, standard of the early
faU.
Hhe fact that so .large a number
c^ ^or^a out, of- the
fiiu causedfntjiny-' peo"
pie to believe that should our troop*
"ID Mexico suffer general loss 6t
mounts this'country would be unable
to replace them at short notice
While if the eveMhreatening possi
bility of a real war with Mexico
shpuld develop it would find us inad
equately supplied in this respect as
in many others. But according to
the statement of one whose business
it is to know every ^hase of the mar
ket, both domestic and foreign, .this
government has little to fear from a
shortage of horses. The country has
an unlimited supply which is at the
first quality.
The firm in this city has four
agents—two in this statei one in
South Dakota ind another in Minne
sot^.—in their employ who are con
stantly buying. The average price
paid the'farmer Is $135 a head, and
though few of .them realize it, the'
buyer stated, it is the farmers who
are making the most money in this
enormous business. For by selling
to the big buyer they receive a fair
price for their stock for which oth
erwise there would be little or no
market, the domestic market/being
at thlp time at its lowest ebll. The
motor truck and automobile have
largely replaced the horse for «0m
mercial purposes and for this reason
the future business of the horse
breeder and th6 big buyer after the
closing of the War is anything but
1 encouraging.
Delivered in Chicago the horses
are turned over by Lepnard & Carson
to Marian A Carpenter, commission
men, and they receive three dollars
a head for each animal accepted by
the agents of France and Italy. At
this time England is not buying
horses in this country an uneon
firmed rumor says that she' Is buying
tltriolfih the French government, but
be-that as it may, France and Italy
alone have agents here. For the big
horse weighing between 1200 and
44fyQ pounds to be used ae an artil
lery or gun horse they will pay $1S0,
no more, and tor the lighter cavalry
horse weighing around 1100, (be
highest price offered is 9130. It
matters not if the animal be of high
or low degree, one price is paid.
Earlier in the fall while, England
was directly in the market, $200
was the common price. The ages
accepted by the French government
rang* between five and nine years,
while Italy takes them a year young
er.
The ways of the foreign agents
who pass Judgment upon the horses
are said to be past understanding
for the standard of acceptance is
variable, and that Which appears to
.•* the bystander as an absolutely per

ment placed her tenth contract with
Ryan for more and'still more horses.
The cost of, transporting the cargo
averages a hundred dollars head
due to the excessive dedth rate. Ful
ly 25 per ent die joh the tilp over.
The length of life given for the
horse bought for service.varies from
three dayB to a year.y The latter
length of time is considered to
nearer correct. The methods used
by, each army is to ftrotert her pien
and horses to the ftiile^t degree po3^
sible and the horses used to bring up

On high authority the statement is
made that it is possible that within
the next few months the market for
war horses is likely to be closed and
this can only mean that if such is
the case,, the war must be drawing
to a close. This is not a prophesy
but straws sliow which way the wind

TIE BOY SCOOT
SPUING CONTEST
A Detailed List of the Articles to Be
Collected and the Prizes That
Are Offered Therefor. ,*
-CONTEST LASTS A MONTH
Mothers and Sisters May See Some
Surprising Things About
the House.
The boy scout spring contest start
ed last Wednesday, although the bad
weather has made collection of the
articles on the list almost an impos
sibility. The list of articles which
may be collected are things which
the coming of spring has brought
into life and being. Each year the
boys have shown increasing interest
in the contest which lasts about one
month and have scoured the woods
and river banks for the specimens to
be secured for the exploring
Mothers must not object to frogs
hopping aboht in the bedroom on
some bright spring morning while
the son and heir lies sleeping.' It
may be (inly the frog he brought
home from the creek last night and
forgot to take it out of his pocket.
And sisters may expect to b&vscared
almost to death with cold, slimy,
wriggly things good only for enter
ing In such contests. The boys will
enjoy the irtfeking of such a collec
tion and the scouting in the woods
for,these objects of n&tural history,
at any time, and with the encourage
ment which jriay^be^aitojded them at
liome, they m#y be "prized winners in
the contest. 7 I
The list of things which alone will
count in the contest are: All wild
flowers, sparrow's egg, carp, sucker,
bullhead, tadpole, snail, mud turtle,
frog, caterpillar, frog's eggs, craw
fish, clam, cottonwood seed, snake,
young radish, maple seed, cocoon.
The first prize oifered will be a
boy ficout fishing outfit. It comes in
a khaki case and includes 4-jointed
steel pole, nickle plated multiple
assortment of hooks, floats and sink
ers, 75 foot braided silk line and
spoon hook*-for trolling.
Second prize, butterfly pet
knock-down.
Fourth prizg-—scout belt.
Fifth prize.—water wings.
Sixth prize—box scout note paper.
Seventh piize—mess cup.
Eighth prize—fish stringer.
Ninth prize—carrying strap.
Tenth prize—two weeks dues paid.
All who see 25 things before they
are "dead" or out of the counting
will receive a scout diary. After a
thing has been seen ten times by dif
ferent boys, it is no longer counted.
Hence the first boy seeing the bull
head or frog, etc., and bringing that
thing to the scout master will re
ceive ten points upon it. The last
one to see it only gets one point.
The butterflies must be in good
condition, killed with chloroform
and mounted with a pin upon clean
cardboard. The wild flowers murt
be shown to the scout master before
they are old and withered.

LEAPS 100 FEET
TO HIS DEATI
Peter C. Blank, Who Installed
the
Machinery in Webster City
Power Plant, Suicides.
TOOK LIFE IN BURLINGTON
yfill he Remembered by Many Who
BecamA Acquainted With Him
in Thia City
Peter C. Blank, the workman who
installed the engines, dynamos, etc
in Webster 'City's new electric light
and power plant about four years
ago, recently took his life in Bur
lington, in which city he was em
ployed by the Murray Iron Works
from whom Webster City purchased
the machinery for our new power
plant. Mr. Blank made many friends
while working here who will hear
with hegret of his untimely taking
iff. The Burlington Gazette gives
the following account of the terrible
tragedy:
Falling' 100 fee,t from the second
story window of the Trans-Miasissip
pi Grain Co. elevator, Peter C. Blank
was Instantly killed at 10:45 this
morning. The body, hurtling
through the air, &truck a small shed
adjacent to the elevator with such
force that roof boards were shatter
ed, and then the mangled remains
rebounded into the air and fell twen
ty feet to the earth.
The act was observed. by only one
witness. Charles Gustafson, who was
standing on the first -fioor «f tjfre ^le
vator, and he was unable to call out
or reach the man In sufficient time
to prevent the death leap.
Blank was a traveling machinist
and erecting engineer for the Mur
ray-Iron Works, and "bore a high rep
ute throughout the city. Friends are
at a loss to account for the act, but
believe previous ill health was the
motive. He had been traveling for
the company, and had returned to
Burlington from Des Moines this
morning. He appeared Jn good
health.
Charles Gustafson, weighman at
the elevator, was the last man to
see Peter Blank alive. Gustafson had
stepped down the stairway leading
from the floor above.
Tom Darnell, of the grain com
pany office force, saw the body fal
ling through the air. There was no
cry for help, and the body fell head
first. It struck the shed with a thud,
breaking through the roof' boards,
and bounded off onto the ground
striking head first. V.
H. Aabel, grain inspector, was the
first man to reach the side of Mr.
Blank, and he states that death en
sued as lie seized the hand of the
man. Coroner Prugft, who arrived
later, identified the remains by
means of a prayer book in the pock
and this identification was later
confirmed by Fire Chief Blank it the
morgue.
The deceased arrived from Des
Moines early this morning on the
Rock island train. He had been in
that city several days installing a
Corliss engine for tlie Murray Iron
works. On the same train wa|9 Ed
Denz, foreman of the Corliss shop.
The men were in different coaches
and did not meet until they left the
train in this city.
Both boarded the same street car,
and to all appearances Mr. Blank
seepaed to be in good health and
spirits. He went to his home, left
his suitcases and told his wife that
he intended going down town for a
short time.
The deceased was born in Turling
ton fifty-one years ago, and during
his entire business career had been
employed b*y the Murray Iron Works.
Three years ago he suffered severely
from trouble with his teeth and was
compelled to undergo an operation.
Pain and worry, resulting from this
sickness, may have been responsible
for this morning's tragedy.
Petition Filed.
The Eastman Kodak company of
New York has filed a petition in the
county clerk's office asking judgment
against H. L. Dow & Company of
Jewell for $78.32 alleged due on,ac

Miss Louise Swanson Secures First
Place in the State Oratorical
Contest at Carroll.
TRIUMPH WINS GOLD MEDAL
First Local Contestant Who Ever
Won First Place in Dramatic
Class.
For the fourth time in the his
tory of Webster City, her high
schools took first place in the state
oratorical contest, the position be
ing won Friday night at Carroll by
Miss Louise Swanpon, daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. A. Swanson, with
her dramatic rendition of "How the
LaRue Stakes Were Lost."
The talented young reader, in
company with Miss Katherine Lane,
teacher of German in the Webster
City high school, left Friday for
Carroll where that night the state
oratorical content was held.- The
contestant^ were the winners of the
several district contests of the state
which have been held this spring.
Miss Swanson early in the winter
won first place in the homo contest,
making her eligible to the contest at
italmond. She won first place there
and entered in the Northwest Dis
trict contest held at Emmetsburg
last month, .winning .also first place
there.
The triumph at Carroll .' carries
with it a gold medal and, Mlss Swan
spn has the distinction ofi being the
first contestant who ever won first
place in the dramatic class for this
city.
The young girl is a senior and will
graduate with the class of 1916 she
possesses brilliant attainments and
not only -has done her regular
work tn an entirely creditable man
ner, but is also a pianist of ability,
and the possessor of a sweet soprano
tf-e which she exercises in the
Girls' Glee Club of the high school.
Miss Swanson's trainer, during the
work of preparation, was Mrs. R. S.
Phillips of this city.
Webster City people will be high
ly elated over this victory for Miss
Swanson which brings much distinc
tion to this place. The first time
this honor was ever won by a local
student was in 1896 by George C.
Tucker, present editor of the Jour
nal who, in his senior year, carried
off first place in the state contest
with his rendition of Lincoln's Gray
son case in the oratorical class. The
local high school then for three suc
cessive years carried off the palm at
the state contests—in 1897, by Will
Martindale, a junior in high school.
the humorous class, with "How
Ruby Played," and in IS98 by Frank"
Wright, a sophomore, with a hum
orous selection, "Darius Green and
His Flyin' Machine."
Not since that time has the state guests present.
