Buy-Right Hints for

You cannot l>o negligent,

adds value.
A small sum spent, for lime,
disinfectants and other cleans

keep germs at bay and pro

Though it was generally thought!
That tiie i|uestlon as to the suitability |
of thv site had been decided, and that j
conflicting opinions h d at last been j
reconciled, the main opposition against'
the plan last night was on the ground |
that the property at Kleventh and j
Main Streets la not suiied to post-office j
needs. anil that the site is not one!
which will best ser\e the people.
Against this was urged the argumenti
that Congress had appropriated $150,000!
expressly to purchase the l'.latr-Carneal j
property, and that representatives of'
the Chamber of Commerce ;.nd others;
had been assured by Senators Martin '
and Swanson and by Congressman Mon
tague that the money could not be.
made available for the purchase of an> j
other site. It was urged that there;
was emergent need for increased facill- :
ties, and that delay might mean the!
failure of the whole plan.

HL I 'ASO. TK.V, April 10.?General
Gabriel Gavira. Carranza commander
at Juarez, to-night announced that the
forces of the facto government worn
in a position to take immediate control
of tho Villa situation if the American
troops withdrew.
General Gavlra's statement was in
connection with the announcement of
Mu Jor-Uenej a I Hugh 1.. Scott. chief of
staff of the American army, that the
purpose of expeditionary force
would he considered accomplished
when >ho Villa. Pandits were dispersed,
or as soon as the troops of (lie tie facto
government are aide to relieve them
of the work.
?'We have moie men than enough
now." said Genera! Gavira. "If we
were aide to overcome Villa when ha
had To.oOO men, over 100 cannon and
plenty of supplies, we ought to he able
to dispose of him now. when his num
bers have dwindled to a few hundred.
Hut it Is a big territory to operate in.
and a single man has more chance to
escape and hide than a large force
would have. However, ?n account of
Villa's wounded condition we think he
will lie taken soon If not, it. is
hardly likely thai, without proper sur
gical care, he wiJl survive for long.''

The arrival of Genera! Bertaiii in
Juarez gave renewed force to the re
ports that General tiavira had keen or
dered to the field. Nothing was learned
of the. whereabouts of 1'otronillo Her
nandez. who was said to have been
mimed as successor to General Gavira,
and who was expected in Juarez to
day.
General Gavira said to-day that tlinl
trials of the men implicated in tho|
alleged plot to seize Juarez in the in
terest of Felix l>inz had been practi
cally completed, and that death -sen
tence would probahw be passed on |
three >r four of them
Interest in the pursuit of Villa and j
tiic diplomatic situation at Washing- j
ton was largely diverted to-day, as far !
as the border was concerned, to the!
reported raising of a new revolutionary!
standard by General Vnez Salazar. j
General Salazar. who has been li\ ing |
here, was one of the nest-Known of the
Mtierta generals. He is believed to
have .rossed the border near Ojinaga j
after issuing a statement denouncing I
Carranza for bringing about "the in-i
vasion" of Mexico by Americans, and I
declaring bis intention- to defend tho I
"sacred soil of his native land."

He was reported as one of the ablest I
Mexican generals. Military men who
have been closely associated with iiim 1
said to-day that be intend* to declare
for Felix Diaz. He complained bit
terly that on account of his "persecu
tion" by Americans ho was forced to
live on the charity of friends
Many Americans were on intimate
terms with the vanished general. They
aver that Salazar has a very largo fol
lowing in Northern I'hihuahua, and)
that hundreds, If not thousands, of tho
Carranza soldiers who fought under
him in previous campaigns gladly will
follow the old leader tf ho summon;
them.

\V A S HINOTO N. April 10.?Such
marked improvement in conditions
along the Mexican border bus been
reported bv General Funston that tho
War Department now is considering
drawing upon some of the troops sta
tioned, in Texas to .strengthen the
ever-lengthening lines ot' communica
tion of the expedition seeking Villa.
The plan is not to disturb the garri
sons or patrol in New Mexico or
Arizona for the present.
Army ofllclals stated to-night that
from now on infantry will be used to
re-enforce communication lines, the
cavalry being kept at the front for the
actual work of running down the out
laws. A part of the Twenty-fourth
Infantry (negroes) withdrawn from
Del Itio. Tex., already has been ordered
into Mexico.
State Department dispatches indi-?
cated that the Carran/.a authorities are
viewing with some anxiety the con
tinued presence of American troops in
Mexico, and are inclined to believe
that the object of the expedition has
been accomplished in the dispersal of
Villa's main command. It is authori
tatively slated, however, that thoro has
been no suggestion from the de facto
government us to a "dead line" beyond
which the American troops should not
go. or as to the date on which they
should be withdrawn.

Senator Gallinger, Republican leader
in the Senate, made public to-nighl a
letter from Senator Fall, who has been,
on the border reporting conditions to
the minority Senators. Senator Pall
said the raid on Columbus was mado
possible by a wide gap in the patrol,
and declared he had been reliably in
formed that unless tho American army
was given full control of the Mexican
Northwestern Railroad within a week
from the date of his letter. April 4,
the expedition would have to be with
<lra wn.
i'fliciaIs pointed out that to-morrow
was the .lay flx?d for the withdrawal
by Senator Kail's informant, and that
Secretary l.ansing formally hud an
nounced that the railroad question no
1 i'iiger was a factor in the situation.
A full report on the Columbus raid has
been ordered, and will ho made as .-to-.n
as Colonel Slocuin. who commanded the
garrison, returns from Mexico.
Army officials to-night likened the
expedition in Mexico to a feath?r
duster, with the cavalry posts as the
sweep and tho constantly lengthen
ing line of communication "the handle"
This handle, they said, had become more
slender. This is believed to have
caused General Funston suggesting
rira wing on the border patrol to
strengthen the line of communication.
