West of River Last
Night.
Ml GREAT WiCtS
s'
General Petain Believed to
?Be Preparing to Strike
Back.
(By Associated Press)
PARIS. April 11.?On the west bank
of the Meuse the Germans made an
attack last night on Dead Man Hill,
advancing from the Corbeaux woods.
They obtained a footing in a few small
elements of trenches, the war office
announced this afternoon, but other
wise were repulsed.
East or the Meuse the Germans at
tacked trenches south of Douaumont
village, but were beaten back with
considerable losses. There was violent
bombardment of Douaumont and
Vaux.
The Crown Prince's supreme effort
for the capture of Verdun, as the mil
I itary observers characterized the op
I eration which began on Sunday to
the west of the Mouse, is spending
itself against teli stout and intelligent
! defense of the French.
! The observers point out that when
? the assailant realizes that he has
' failed to attain his objective, he in
[ variably delivers an extended assault
I with great violence before lapsing into
normal trench warfare. Such was the
great German attack during the bat
! tie of Ypros on November 10. five days
before the battle ended and the first
trench battle in Champagne on
March 18. 1015, also closed with a
violent assault;^ .
v In "these . operations the assailant
hopes to surprise the defenders by an
unexpected effort and to wrest from
h}m by taking him unawares, the re
ward of their, own sacrifices. General
Petain. the French commander at Ver
dun, was not caught napping^ but for
saw the possibility of such "a move,
and strengthened his line in anticipa
tion of it. The battle continues, but
with a preceptible dwindling of vio
lence.
The French commander's plan is to
engage the least possible number of
men so as to retain the maximum
number of formation for the ultimate
operations which are to be enterod on
at a moment which he will consider
opportune and which will probably
be decided by him when he considers
that the Germans have wasted all the
men they are willing to sacrifice.
Since the beginning of the battle,
the Germans have employed 32 divi
sions. it is asserted, and It Is im
possible for them to long continue
their efforts on the prosont scale. AI
radical chance is looked for shortly.
German Prisoners
At Verdun Many
BERLIN, April 11.?Since February
21 the CennauR have captured tnoro
than 36,000 French in the fighting
around Verdun, the Overseas News
agency announced today.
West of,the Muse, about 25 square
kilometers or ground has boon occu
pied tho announcement says. "Ger
man newspapers point out that the
French now say Bethlnconrt was evac
uated in accordance with plans prev
iously made. Nevertheless It. has been
ascertained that an order was issued
stating this important place must be
held in all circumstances". The fact
that more than 700 umvounded French
prisoners wore taken and tho French
losses in killed and wounded were far
greater Is proof that the French plan
of evacuation could not ho carried out
as intended.
