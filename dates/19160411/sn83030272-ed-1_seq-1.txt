J. P. Morgan hag made another Im
portant sale from the great collection of
art objects irathcrcd by his father. P.
W. Krench Co. announced yesterday
the purchase of atl of the tapestries lent
to the Metropolitan Museum by the late
J. Plerpont Morgan. The price paid was
somewhat greater than J2.000.O0O.
The sale Is by far the most Important
that has yet been made by Mr. Morgan
from the collection which Is generally
supposed to have cost the. late Mr. Mor
gan $;s.000,000. There nr.- other parts
of the Morgan art treasures on view In
the Metropolitan Museum that may have
made a more popular appeal, but there
was nothing- finer or more Intrinsically
valuable to art lovers than the tapestries.
It Is a point In the history of art
sales In America that there have been
few. If any. of greater Importance than
the one announced yesterdav. Mr. Mor
gan'a collection of tapestries Is the only
one of great importance on mis conn
nent. If the collection In Itself cannot
tea . th. flrst of Its kind In the
world It can at least be aald that It In-
