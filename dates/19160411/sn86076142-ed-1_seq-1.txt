WATER RISES IN THE
G'T WESTERN SHAFT
DEEP SHAFT TAPS A FLOW THAT
RESEMBLES THE FLOOD
OF THE VICTOR
The Great Western mine is troubled
with water which rose in the station
In the shaft but the matter Is not ser
ious as Manager Magee expects to
master the rush by installing auxiliary
pumps to hold the pressure until he
can put in machinery capable of hand
ling the stream.
It was supposed that the old equip
ment of the mine would be equal to
the task of disposing of any water that
might come in, but last night, after
shooting, the vnlunie grew so rapidly
that it soon reached the shaft and
began climbing. The management be
lieves this is the same underground
reservoir that kept the Victor busy
for nearly a year and which it was
thought had been exhausted, but it
appears there remains a liberal sup
ply of moisture to Justify the placing
of a stronge equipment.
Had It not been for the work of the
Victor which pumped 300,000 to 500,
ooo gallons dally for a long period it
is believed the trouble would furnish
a serious problem. As It is It be
comes merely a question of getting the
larger pumps into action to bring the
flow tinder control.
The pump motor at the bottom of
the shaft was drowned, but there Is
another pump at the 800 foot point.
which mav he used In conjunction
with the bailer.
Manager Magee said this afternoon
"There is no serious trouble at the
mine that we cannot master in a few
days. It Just happened that lust night
when we ran into another lot of
stringers the power went off and the
water came back into the station
flooding the motor. We will be all
right soon and there will be no ma
terial delay or damage."

UNIQUE FEATURES
OF DAMAGE SUIT
Illy AsMoelitlei! lreN.I
LOS ANGELES, Apr. 11. Unique
features are involved in the Chafor
suit, a test case that was brought by
George and Edward Chafor, the hus
band and minor son of Edith E. Cha
for who was killed, May 24, 1913, in
the collapse of a municipal pier at
Long Beach, Cal. The accident was
known as the Empire Day Disaster,
since It occurred during a celebration
by British residents of the late Queen
Victoria's birthday.
In the collapse of the pier forty
persons were killed outright and a
number died afterwards from their in
juries. In addition to the Chafor case,
187 Buits for damages were filed in
the superior court, but trial of them
was delayed by agreement until the
state supreme court should decide the
test case. The sums asked In the 187
cases total $3,500,000.
Damages of $15,000 was asked for
In the Chafor case and after a trial
lasting 21 days, a verdict of $7,500
was awarded the plaintiffs by a Jury
In the superior court. j
The theory of the "keynote" vibra-.
tion was advanced by the City or
Long Beach In its defense. The key
note theory Is an application of the
traditional assertion that a violin
player under certain circumstances by
playing the "keynote" of a great build- i
ing can cause it to collapse. In ap
plying this theory, the defense argu-j
ed that a group of Sctoch bagpipers!
leading the Empire Day celebration I
parade stopped on the pier and struck
the dangerous keynote while the
crowd swaying to the rhythm of the
music accentuated this. j
The bag pipers piped. It was shown,
for several minutes while someone
hurriedly sought a forgotten key to
the municipal auditorium to admit the
waiting crowd, gathered on the two
story pier. In the collapse, 850 per
sons on the top deck of the pier were
dropped thirty feet amid wreckage to
the sand beneath.
The plaintiffs argued that the pier
was old and rotten and collapsed
through weakness and structural de
fects. The defense also advances the the
ory that the city was performing a
government function" - In operating '
the pier and auditorium and therefore
it was not liable for damages.
This was opposed by the testimony
of the plaintiff's, showing a payment
of $25 for the use of the auditorium.
This payment, it was contended,
made the operation of the building a
private enterprise conducted by the
municipality.
One of the speculative features of
the case wag as to the manner ot
collecting any awards if the supreme
court should uphold the verdict and
proportionately large damages should
be given In the other hundred and
eighty-seven cases.
It was contended that actively used,
municipal property could not be sub
jected to levies to satisfy such judg
ments, but only a restricted class of
property attached. It was pointed out
by attorneys also, that such Judg
ments, if rendered, never would be
satisfied by a bond Issue because,
given the known elements of human
nature, the citizens of Long Beach
probably would not vote such an Is
sue. WILL REVIEW WORK OF LODGE
