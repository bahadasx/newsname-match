GRAND THEATER
UNSAFE, UNFIT
i FOR THE PUBLIC
Startling Revelations in State
and City Report Today.
Crawfords Must Make Changes
or Close Opera House.
MUST REWIRE ENTIRE HOUSE
All Dressing Rooms and Open
Work Is in Bad Shape.
Fire Escapes .ot Sufficient to
Take Care of Crowd.
The Grand Opera House has
been condemned by both state
and city officials today, as un
safe and unfit for the public use.
Unless the manager heeds
the notices and recommenda
tions sent him today the place
must be closed.
In merciless terms do both reports
point out to Roy Crawford, the man
ager of the Grand, the lax conditions
of affairs and the daily danger that is
run by permitting such conditions to
exist.
In a letter accompanying his re
port State Iabor Commissioner Mc
Bride says:
"It will be necessary for you to
re-wire the house at once to com
ply with all the requirements of
the National Klectrical Code, and
the fire escape on the north side
must be repaired to make it suf
ficiently strong to support any
number of people that could be
crowded on it. and the wood stair
way at the south of the building
must be replaced by substantial
metallic stairway fire escape."
This isn't aH In his report he
points out:
"The wiring to one lamp socket
in the toilet at the west side of
the stage leads to a socket which
can be seen through the wood
wall without any tubing or bush
ing to protect it. The stage elec
trician made the statement that
when a fuse blew out he could
riot tell where it was any more
than to go hunt until he found
some place where a fuse was out."
"All dressing rooms, all open work,
are. like the rest of the building, in
bad shape." is the way he scathingly

More Than 300 Delegates Here!
for Jubilee Convention.

Evening Addresses by Goyemor
Tapper and T. A. McXeal.
Not oftener than once in twelve
years does Topeka have the oppor
tunity of entertaining the convention
of the State Federation of Women's
cluh.et. This is their jubilee year, and
today began the business sessions of
the convention.
The delegates to the convention be
gan to arrive Monday morning, and
all day Monday ind all day today,
trains were met by taxis- to convey
the delegates to places of registration.
More than three hundred delegates,
and twenty-five officers are in Topeka
for the annual meeting of the federa
tion. The guests were taken to the
Y. W. C. A. rooms yesterday, where a
group of women sat about a table, like
the polling places on election day, and
worked busily to register all the vis
itors and to assign them to their
hostesses.
The first event of the convention-
was a reception given Monday niffht
by Governor and Mrs. rapper at their
home in Topeka avenue.
Mayor House Beoosnixon Ttiem.
Memorial hall was well filled with
convention delegates today. The vis
itors were welcomed in a speech by
Mayor J. K. House, introduced by Itrs.
J. M. Miller. "I have never professed
to be passionately devoted to the club
movement." Mr. House said, "but I
would be more obtuse than I am if
I did not recognize the service club
women have rendered to their com
munity and to other women. Women
are the most splendid jewels in the i
world also the finest scenery Sh i
is brightened by the rubbing of mind
against mind, made possible by the j
clubs. The women's clubs have j
brought beauty and interest into many
lives that otherwise would be dull and
sordid.
"Topeka is very hospitable, especial-
ly to those who come and stay long '
enough to spend some monev. I wel- j
come you officially, and would be glad
to do anything I could, personally or i
officially, to make your stay nleasant." j
Mrs. Arthur C apper's Welcome.
Mrs. Arthur Capper, the wife of the
governor, made a short welcome ;
speech, saying: "I want to say to the
club women that our welcome Is not
perfunctory nor forced. This meeting
of intelligent women, concerned in all
that makes for human improvement.
is a greater thing than we realize. Dr. j
Johnson said that a woman making a
speech was like a dog standing on his
hind legs. You marvel not that it is
well done, but that it is done at all.
He would be puzzled hy the twen
tieth century woman who concerns
herself with educational, social, moral
and religious problems. But we un
derstand that the development that
comes from an interest in the prob
lama of the world will have fruitful
results. The city feels friendly to
ward you. and T extend our heartiest
welcome."
Mrs. M'-Kaohron Was HI.
Mrs. A. Marburg read an address
from Mrs- D. L. McEachron. president j
of the Topeka Federation, who is ill.
"We have our city polished to receive
OUT guests; our clean curtains are
hung, and our rugs bright hide up, and !
are doing our best for you. But you
are bringing to us more than we are
giving, and we will hereafter be better
able to meet our problems." Western j
Sorosis was represented by Miss Lola !
Graham, who told of a federation !
meeting in Topeka 20 years ago, when
Western Sorosis was the hostess club, t
She spoke of the increased power of
the federation in its development of
twenty years. Mrs. W A. Johnston !
gave a word of welcome on behalf of ;
the West Side Forestry' club, and Dr- '
Anna Foy welcomed the guests in the I
name of the Research club. Mrs. Otis
Hungate extended a welcome from the I
Current Literature club. Mrs. H. O. i
Garvey spoke on behalf of the Vig-
nette club. "The Vignette club is the j
oldest club in Topeka, and was or- j
ganized to offer something like univer- j
sity extension work for busy young j
women." Mrs. Garvey read a short j
original poem, expressing the welcome i
sentiment.
Keynote of Peace.
Mrs. W. D. Atkinson spoke in re-
sponse to the greetings. "Every con- !
vention." she said, "must have its key- j
note- May I say that the keynote of j
this convention should be peace, inter- t
national peace. Our organization is j
governed by education and reason, and ;
we care not for force and militancy.
We should support the kind of pre-
paredness that means permanent I
peace, and not the kind that looks to- ;
ward hostility; not the kind that en- j
courages a challenge to other nations f
in the sense of national military pow-
er." Mrs. Atkinson also suggested j
standardizing the work of the federa- j

planned when Wagner withdrew

Murphy of leaven worth withdrew
at ten o'clock this morning. His
name will not go before the con
vention. Anti-Tliompison forces
will support Sapp, it was asserted.
"I have decided to not make the
race," said Murphy. "My name
will not be presented. I am for
Orr."

Hutchinson. Kan.. April 11. With
the withdrawal of E- E. Murphy of
Leavenworth from the race for na
tional committeemanship the Demo
cratic state convention here today set
tled down to fight out the issue be
tween J. W. Orr. of Atchison and W.
F. Sapp of Galena. The convention
swung from a three cornered contest
between Orr, Sapp and John E. Wag
ner of Larned for committeeman
through the "Harmony" stage in
which Murphy was named as the log
ical candidate and back again to a
contest between the federal and state
factions of the party.
Chairman Murphy called the con
vention to order at 12:15 o'clock. Ho
read telegrams of congratulation to
the Democratic party from the follow
ing; United States Senator W. H.
Thompson. Dudley Doolittle. congress
man from the Fourth district; Jouett
Shouse, Seventh district congressman;
Joseph Taggart. Second district con
gressman; John R Connelly. Sixth
district congressman, and W. A. Aycrs
of the Eighth district.
Insurgents had caucused before en
tering the convention. They an-
nounced a clean-cut slate a.eainst the i
federal machine Anti-irachine deU- ,
sates were urged to support A. A. 1
Doerr, Larned ; Sain a e". f5rtiett. Klls- j
worth; Mrs. W. A. Harris, Kansas City, j
and W. H. Carpenter. Marion, for ?
big four places. Thompson leaders ;
will also support Mrs. Harris.
With Hodges pledged to the support -.
of Senator Thompson the federal j
crowd insisted on keeping their lead- j
er in the race. They also drew th-; ;
lines for Neeley voters.
Will Not Nominate Orr.
As he entered the convention Mur
phy stated that he did not expect to
second the nomination of Orr, al
though the vote of the Leavenworth !
delegation would be delivered to him. ,
Murphy in said to have agreed several j
weeks ago to take the floor for Orr.
S. B. Amidon of Wichita was chose 1 j
temporary chairman without opposi- i
tion and J. M. Lewis of Kinsley was j
placed as temporary secretary. In his ;
address, Chairman Amidon lauded
President Wilson's policy in Mexic
and in foreign affairs and made i
Pl"leushrememyber that we have anippS Hears That No Money
election next November and we need ;
neace and harmony for the best in- i
terest of the party," he said. ''Already
that distinguished king of American
rough riders has lassoed the Hepubli-
can party ana ne win iiit; uic uvim
nation at the Chicago convention. This
will afford the Democrats in Kansas
the privilege of carrying the state by
25,000 majority at the next election."
Recess Until 3 p. m.
Both Whitney and Thomas delega
tions held seats in the convention dur
ing the preliminary urgaiuiiinni.
Their contest was to be fought before
the credential committee.
Thomas and Billaid sat side by side
in the convention. Thomas was un
moved and unresponsive when Chair
man Murphy brought repeated ap
plause by his tributes to the Wilson
administration. Billard showed equal
lack of concern when the delegates
applauded mention of Hodges. ,
were named and instructed to report
after the recess which was taken until
3 o'clock.
Fight on Neeley.
George A. Neeley of Hutchinson
barely saved his Seventh ('..strict dele
gates in the big four fight when the
Seventh district insurgents sought to
instruct the district convention for A.
A. Doerr of Larned. Neeley himself
took the floor to fight for adjourn
ment and was beaten 71 to 62. After
a hard battle the Doerr resolution was
tabled but Neeley was forced to go to
the state convention with half of his
district against him.
The Neeley tight started when a
number of insurgents refused to fol
low the Hodges suggestion and line
up for Thompson. The fight on
Thompson meant a fight on Neeley.
It was started in his home district an
hour in advance of the state conven
tion. Anti-Thompson delegates spent the
morning in an effort to line up dele
gates for Sapp. Hodges and Farrelly
directed the fight on Orr. More than
50 postmasters and federal appointees
got in the fight tor Orr and the
Thompson machine.
Sixth District Scare.
Sixth district delegates threw a
' scare Into the Thompson camp when '
i they adopted a resolution against th: '.
j selection of any federal office holder j
i to a place on the delegation. The
, fight for the resolution came from
! the insurgent camp and was carried ,
against an organization directed by a
dozen Sixth district postmasters.
Miss Vernon There.
That the Democrats might miss
nothing in the w ay of trouble Miss Ma
bel Vernon came to town at a most
inopportune time. She wanted her
pet resolution for national suffrage
endorsed. She sat in a box with a
half dozen Hutchinson club women
during the preliminary organization
Whether she would personally go
before the committee depended on
the attitude of members. Her resolu-
tion will be urged she declared. An-
drew Shearer of Marshall countv a
member of the resolutions committee
j declared emphatically he would fight
I the measure.
Two hours was allowed the commit
tees to work out their programs while
delegates went to lunch. It was after
3 o'clock when Chairman Amidon
i called the convention to order and the
stage was set for the final fight for
delegates and national committeeman.
A Night of Trouble.
Kansas Democrats spent a troubled
niKht before the convention and in final
hours sought harmony in real earnest
some oi mem. ine nrsi step was
laiven w nen oeorge II nouges and
Hugh P. Farrelly lined up their forces

today.

"Wnuld the commissioners go to
the point of sending the money out
side the county in enforcing a demand
for 3 per cent?"' was asked. ,
"I wouldn't want to say that." was
the reply. "1 haven't talked with the
other members of the board about it.
But the people of Shawnee county
may rest assured that we are as anx
ious as they are to get every possible
cent of Interest due. And If the city
succeeds in getting 3 per cent we will
demand it. The county's money is
worth as much as the city's money.
Mr. Nipps stated that he bad
broached the subject to one banker
this morning but that he had been
unable to get much satisfaction.
Banker Says They Can't Afford It.
"He did say this," said Mr. Nipps,
"that no bank could make any money
and pay three per cent interest on
daily balances."
The banks pay 3 per cent to the
state; why not to the county?
The county now receives two and
one-half per cent on dally balances,
and has for over three years. Pre
vious to that it received only two per
cent.
"As I remember it," said Mr. Nipps,
"we asked for an increase of one-half
of one per cent within six months
after I became commissioner. The
banks did not object seriously to in
creasing the rate to two and one-half
per cent, but they did object to going
any higher."
I,ast Year's Collection.
Last year the county collected a to
tal of $8,444.10 in interest from To
peka banks on daily balances at the
rate of two md one-half per cent. An
increase of one-half of one per cent
would have added to the total more
than $1,600. This year the daily bal
ances will probably be more than they
I were a year ago and the interest would
i be greater.

Paris reported today. It is estimated
that the French losses have been
very heavy.
Throughout yesterday the Germans
cha rged ceaselessly, t h rowing one di

on Dead Man's hill with machine Ilk

The German assault on the dfne
of Verdun is still centered on the all
important key position of Dead Man's
hill, west of the Me use. Advancing
from Corbeaux wood, the Germans
last night succeeded In gaining a few
elements of French trenches. Other
wise the French war office announces
they were beaten back with heavy
losses.
In the sector between Dnuaumnnt
and Vaux, which has relatively the
ame strategic importance east of the
Meuse the Germans also renewed the
attack. There, the French report
savs. they e3lned no success.

the Germans as their supreme effort
