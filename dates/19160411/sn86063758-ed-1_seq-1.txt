XIL hEItlilCK DECLINES li
|jg TO RUN FOR SENATE
Friends through The Herald a d
m News have called upon me to make L<
Jf the race for the 'State senate. i j i
I wish most sincerely to thank \i
.those friends for the confidence in
me and the tender of support which Cc
*. tris eal. indicates. m
iTwo years ago I was a candidate Ve
for the house and although defeated.
received a most genrous support from !
the people. I thought then that I
could afford the time if elected to
? *irw1 +rw SPfVP t.h^
>*51 * C CUC uuu W ~ ? J ^
people and not personal ambition- was jj
> my only motive. ?
There are times when a patriotic ^
citizen may find it a duty to accept
and eve : to seek office at a personal
sacrifice. I am sure that there is no 4,
t ill
necessity for that in cnis county now. ^
I am engaged in a business that rewi
| quires close and careful attention all
f so
the time. I have a large family to rear
and educate. To en-gage in politics
means that I must slight my business
\ rv
and neglect my family ana tnis I can-; *
not feel that I should do.
And so to my friends I must say that
while my appreciation of the compliment
you have paid be Is genuinely j sa
heartfelt I must decline to become a j bl
candidate this year for any office, but I wi
as a private in the ranks I am willing ' sc
I to join hands and help to elect men T1
L who will give the county and State an
booest and progressive administration of
I which will be to the interest of all the sa
b people of South Carolina. of
Very truly yours, It
