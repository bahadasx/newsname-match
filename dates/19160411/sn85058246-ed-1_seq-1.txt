I CITY SCHOOLS
I ARE GROWING '
I VERJfJAPIDLY
B Wo wcro Informed yesterday by
H Supt. A. Molyneux, of thn Logan
H City schools that the Board of Edu-
H cation Ib at tho present time dlscuun-
B lng in a preliminary way plans for
a junior high school for Logan City.
Hj It is said that tho Drlghnm Young
College which has been schooling tho
H high school students of Logan City
and tho surrounding valloy In years
H past, has reached a decision to cllm-
Hj jnato tho ninth grade work from its
H curriculum in tho fall of 1917.
H In this event, students of high
H school ngo will not havo a homo n
B "tho city or tho Agricultural College
H are not prepared to take catc of thoso
H students. Therefore, Supt. Molyneux
' says that something must bo dono to
H provide buildings and facilities to
H tako caro ,of, these students.
' H During tho past eight years tho
H Logan City schools havo undcrgono
H a wonderful growth. The school pop-
' H ulatlon has Increased S3 per cent,
' whllo tho upper grades, havo lncroas-
' B cd far greater than tho lower grades.
' Wo aro Informed that tho eighth
' H grado In this snmo length of tlino
,ina Increased In numbers over 400
per cent.
During tho past season, according
to tho city superintendent, over 80
pupils which should bo In attendanco
at tho Kowell school on account of
tho lack of room, have been forced
Into other schools op tho city and in
this way they havo boon unable to
get tho advantages of the Industrial
work which Is offered at tho Lowell.
According to thoso In chargo of tho
schools tho nltuntlon Is becoming des
perate and something must bo dono
to relievo this cramped position.
At tho present tlmo tho school of
ficials are debating whether thoy will
get their money by taxation or by
W bonding.
