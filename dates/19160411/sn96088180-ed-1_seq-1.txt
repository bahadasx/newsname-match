Frledrlch Wllbelm' strongest blow
against Verdun today. - :
The French offensive rivals that
which the crown prince Is launching
against Dead Man's bill, where the
mash at Verdun has reached Its
highest power.
Leaping from their trenches to
meet the advancing horde of Ger
mans', the French fought them to a
standstill and halted them every
where, except along the barren north
eastern rld,ge of . Dead Man's hill,
where the Germane gained a foot
hold.
Hurled back from the French
barbed wire entanglements, the tide
of spiked helmets receded, leaving
a trail of dead and dying, while tons
of metal from thundering guns con
ceiled In forests and behind hills
dropped with tremendous explosions
In the midst of the struggling masses.
Berlin's statements Indicated that
the French lost at least 100,000 men
In the defense. It . waa also semi
officially claimed tttat more than 28.
000 French prisoners had. been
taken. Paris figured German losses

The battle has narrowed to a three

NEW VERSION OF THE WOUNDING
OF VILLA REPORTED FROH EL
El Paso," April 11. -American cav
alry la reported to havo entered the
state of Durango today. v Far in ad
vance of the United States torcee,
Francisco Villa Is at Tepehuanos, on
tho main highway loading to Durango
City, it was reported. Besides these
unoonflrnied advices, arrivals from
Chihuahua City brought a new ver
sion of the' circumstances under
which Villa was woundod.
They say that Andreas Rehnza, a
Mexican, shot Villa In the leg at
Guerroro Maroh 30, after his daugh
ter had boen outraged. VIlllBtas
caught Itehaza, who attempted to floe
after firing tho shot. He was drag

these repeated attacks but have
driven the Germans back In places
In savage hand-to-hand lighting on
the southern tank of Forges brook.
Beginning with the new Infantry
assaults Saturday, the battle baa
hourly become more violent until
now it appears" that It Is about to
culminate In a grand German as
sault on both banks of the Meuse..
"It the French hold this time, Ver
dun la eared beyond a doubt," de
clared a prominent English authority
today.
Twenty thousand Germans have
been killed or disabled in two days
of the new Verdun attack. Paris el
so admitted today that the French
losses were very heavy. , : ,
All day yesterday the Germans
charged ceaselessly, one rank dash
ing forward, only to be blown to
pieces and Immediately succeeded by
a fresh rank, rushing Into the same
hell of bullets and shrapnel.
Division after division was sent
against Dead Man's hill, but they
only succeeded In penetrating ad
vanced . positions, and the French
claim that most of these were recap
tured y immedUts,.CQunter-ttacka.
Encouraged by their success"' In
seising Termltten ridge the German
commanders ordered a frontal at
tack on Hill 304. The Teuton came
on In mass formation. They (became
lost and confused, however. In bar
ren ravines and when the units were
more or less demoralized by this,
French guns, which had been con-,
cealed on all sides, suddenly opened
firei Under this punishment from
scores of cannon the German attack
halted. Aa the kaiser's men retired
the French guns dropped dozens of
high explosive shells among their
huddled masses, lifting groups of
shattered men out of the ranks, blow
ing them to pieces and biting great
holes In the confused crowds.
Similar bloody scenes were enacted
between Haucourt and Bethincourt.
But on the eastern side, where the
ravines sheltered the Germans from
the French artillery, , the Teutons
shattered the French advanced line
for more than a quarter of a mile.
The latter five were again said to
be Dr. Stell, Lee Llndsey and Frank
Wood, Americans; Herman Blanken-
burg, German, and Donald -McGregor,
British.
Travelers arriving . here strongly
denounced ,th.o Carranzlstas. They
charged government troops stepped
out of Villa's path after he had de
feated them at Guerrero. In Villa's
flight from American forces through
MInaca, La Junta, El Raneho de San
tiago, Clorro Prletp, Satevo and Ojo
Amies', he was not at any time op
posed by Carranzlstas, according to
these travelers. ,: A'
The constitutionalists did not
march from Chihuahua City after
Villa until he was known to be well
on his way to Durango.
How the Carranzlstas at Durango
City will receive Villa Is a question
uppermost In the minds of officials.
A portion of the garrison, under the
Arrleta brothers, was reported op
posed to the American "Invasion."
This report was not confirmed.
Other reports had It that the Arrleta
