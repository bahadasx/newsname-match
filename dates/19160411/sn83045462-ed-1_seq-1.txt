FORUM RIGHT ASKED
BY COMMISSIONERS
Communication to Congress
Gives Reasons for Desire to
Make Use of Schools.
RECOIVfMENDS PASSAGE
OF BILL NOW PENDING
"Ouicken Sense of Responsibility of
Men and Women for Welfare of
Young," It Demands.
The use of the public schools of the
District of Columbia as community
forums and for other purposes is urged
by the board of Commissioners. In
recommending the passage of a House
and Senate bill providing for the use
of schools for such purposes the Commissioners
today sent a communication
to Congress.
The purpose of the present bill, now
pending, is to supplant existing legislation
by requiring the Commissioners
to designate a limited number of school
buildings for use as community lorums
and to define and fix the territorial
limit of community forums which may
be organized in accordance with the
provisions of the bill, as well as to impose
certain duties upon the board of
education.
No Objection to the Work.
The Commissioners called attention
to the fact that there may be some differences
of opinion as to whether the
duty of designating certain public
school buildings for the use of community
forums should be imposed upon
the Commissioners or upon the board
of education. In this connection the
Commissioners state they have no objection
to t^he work, neither have they
any objection to so amending the bill
as to impose this duty upon the board
of education.
"The very essence of the educational
service which the public schools can
render to the association of mature men
and women in any community consists
in the quickening of the sense of
responsibility on their part for the welfare
of the young," the Commissioners
said. "The public school itself is essentially
a community creation of the
natural parental sense of responsibility
of the mature for the welfare of the
immature, which is perhaps the most
important, fundamental and effective
instinct that makes for the wellbeing
and improvement of society.
"The use of public school buildings
as authorized by this bill is not intended
in any manner to interfere or conflict
with the primary and essential j
character and purpose of the public'
school, but is intended merely to In- j
crease the usefulness of the buildings j
by making them available as commu- i
nuy meeting piuces, iur mc iiuunt, cuu - .
cation of the community through the
open presentation and free discussion
of public questions."
Action by Various States.
They said, further, that legislation
looking toward the full use of public I
school property has been enacted in 1
Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
Connecticut. New York, New Jersey, j
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia. West I
Virginia. Ohio, Indiana. Illinois. Kentucky,
Iowa. Michigan, Wisconsin', J
North Dakota, .South Dakota. Okla- i
homa. New Mexico, Idaho. Utah, Califfbrnia,
Oregon and Washington.
It was also pointed out that the provisions
of the bill are practically iden- j
tical with the law which has been in
operation in Wisconsin for five years,
and in other states for periods ranging
from one to five years, except that this
bill provides for the definite fixing of :
responsibility for executive secretarial
service incidental to the consistent use
of the public school building.
The Commissioners said they are in j
entire sympathy with the general purpose
of the proposed legislation.
Miss Wilson to Advocate
Community Forum Measure
At a hearing before the House committee
on the District of Columbia tomorrow
morning. Miss Margaret Wilson
has been announced as the principal
speaker in favor of the? HollisJohnson
bill to permit the use of
schools for community forum purposes

purposes. Miss Wilson will appear as
chairman of the committee appointed
by the Grover Cleveland Community
Forum, the organization whose exclusion
from a school building by the
hoard of education furnished the occasion
for the drafting of the Hollis
Johnson bill. An announcement sent
out by the Grover Cleveland Community
Forum states that Jackson H. Ralston
and William F. Gude will also appear.

An exchange of persoralties between
Representatives Moore of Pennsylvania
and Madden of Illinois at the outset of
today's closing discussion of the rivers

the House to expunge from the record
remarks made by Mr. Moore. "The gentleman
from Illinois." said Mr. Moore,
after there had been a bantering back and
forth regarding Mr. Madden's opposition
to inland waterways matters, "is a kindly
gentleman who has gotten along to
that stage in life where he can afford to
throw away a thousand dollars here and
there in a vain effort to bribe members
of Congress to his way of thinking. I
am not in such a financial position."
Demands Words Be "Taken Down."
Mr. Madden immediately demanded
that the Pennsylvaiftan's\ words "be
taken down." The words were read
from the rostrum. Speaker Clark was
called to the chair and by a viva voce
vote the words were striken from the

he was heartily in favor of the expunging
as he had sought to withdraw

i
GEN. PERSHING'S
HEADQUARTESRS AT
FRONT, April 10, 10 p.m.,
via Mexican Telegraph to
Juarez, April n.?Renewed
reports have been received
here by Gen. Pershing that
Francisco Villa is dead and
buried. These reports are
under investigation. Meanwhile
the hunt for the Villa
bandits is proceeding with
renewed vigor with the arrival
at the front of Gen.
Pershing.
Unofficial and unconfirmed reports
that Villa is dead reached
the Carranza embassy today and
were given some degree of credence
by officials there. The reports
were represented as having
come from Queretaro, Gen. Carranza's
provisional capital.
Grounds for Believing Beport.
They were unsubstantiated by the
latest dispatches to the War and State
departments. The circumstantial reports
of Villa's recent injury, however,,
and the rigors of his long and hurried
flight, in which he has been variously
reported as being carried on a litter,
on the shoulders of his men or in a
carriage over the rough Mexican trails,
gave some color to the possibility that
the bandit chieftain may have been
unable to survive the hardships of the
flight in his disabled condition. j
Part of the United States troops sta- ! (
tioned in Texas may be sent into Mex- J '
ico to strengthen the constantly length- j
ening lines of communication of the 1
United States expeditionary force in I
I pursuit of Villa. Such a plan was un- ;
j der consideration by the War Department
today as a result of the situation 1
along the border, which is said- to be ,
i quieter than heretofore. For the pres- '
ent, however, patrols in Xew Mexico i
j and Arizona will not be disturbed.
I
Border Patrol Numbers 18,565.
i Official estimates of the number of 1
troops in Mexico and on the border 1
available for an emergency were given 1
at the War Department today. Gen. ]
! Scott, chief of staff, announced that 1
j 18,565 troops now constitute the border (
patrol. Gen. Pershing has about 12,000
men in Mexico, including those holding j (
his line of communication. How great- ,
lv the mobile army has been drawn ]
upon for the Mexican expedition and j
border service was also disclosed by j
Gen. Scott. He estimated that only
4,000 troops remain in the United j
i States not engaged on the border. 1
The only troops remaining at army
posts are the 2d Cavalry, divided bej
tween Fort Myer. Va.. and Fort Ethan
I Allen. Vt.; the 3d and 30th Infantry
along the great lakes, the 14th Infan- j
! try, divided between Fort Wright,
Alaska, and Fort Law ton. Okla.; the 1
21st Infantry, divided between San <
Diego, Cal., arid Vancouver, Wash., t
with one battalion at Calexico and one
troop of the 13th Cavalry at the Fort
I Riley, Kan., service school. '*
' Gen. Scott also stated today that no 1
word of the chase of Villa had been <
received for several days, either from
Gen. Pershing or Gen. Funston. Diffi- *
culty of communication, as well as cen- 1
sorship extending to the War Depart- <
ment itself, Gen. Scott declared, had ,
left the department in ignorance of recent
operations.
Await Gen. Pershing's Report. j
The department asked for details of *
Gen. Pershing's conferences with Gens. J
Herrera and Gutierres, but Gen. Fun- 1
eton telegraphed today that no further 1
word has come from Gen. Pershing. J
American Consul Letcher of Chihua- 1
hua apparently is aiding Gen. Pershing
to get supplies. Gen. Funston reported t
today that Gen. Pershing reported be- 2
ing in touch with Consul Letcher and C
expected to get supplies from Chihua- a
hua. r
Special Agent Rodgers of the State i
Department, assigned to Carranza's p
headquarters at Queretaro, telegraphed t
today he was detained in Mexico City p
in connection with commercial ques- d

were implicated.
EL PASO, Tex.. April it ?
The southward rush of the American
cavalry forces pursuing
Francisco Villa has been so rapid
that it has carried Col. Dodd and
his troops far beyond all lines of
communication.
Officials of the Carranza government
in Juarez are making attempts
today to gain information
over the Mexican land lines in regard
to the advance position of
the American troops. No official
word of the whereabouts of the
advance guard has been received
for days.
Reports of Battle With Villa.
Army officers at Fort Bliss believe
that when the expeditionary commanders
set in touch with Maj. Gen. Funston
they will report that the American
troops have engaged the Villa forces
in battle. Reports that a battle has
been fought with Villa hands south of
Satevo were current early today, but
there was nothing to confirm these reports.
While the American cavalry are
combing the country at the far end of
the attentuated line of communications,
there was little apprehension over their
position, for it was felt at Fort Bliss
that Dodd's men could fight themselves
put of any uncomfortable position.
Scouts and refugees with knowledge
of the country south of Parral say that
the American troops will find it peculiarly
difficult to operate in any numbers
against Villa in the district where
te is now fleeing.
The Arrieta brothers are said to be
fortifying the city of Durango, but for
what purpose has not been indicated.
Expect Important Developments.
The opinion of army officers at Gen.
Funston's headquarters that the next
'ew days will bring important developments
in the situation created by
:he expedition against Villa was
strengthened today. With sentimentipparently
growing stronger among
followers of Carranza for the United
States government to withdraw American
troops from Mexican soil and reinquish
pursuit of the outlaw forces
>f the de facto government, officers
lere believe the issue will be forced
n the near future.
Movirnn railroads are made
ivailable for the transportation of
supplies to Gen. Pershing's command,
t is frankly admitted in military circles,
chances are against success of
:he campaign. Although the troops
lave penetrated 400 miles south of the-"
jorder. Villa has managed to main:ain
his lead, and the field force cannot
;ontinue much farther unless supply
