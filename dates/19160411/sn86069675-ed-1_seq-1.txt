response to the. question
"Wjhal
tjhat arc the two tliingsraost ur
gently needed for tho commercial
advancement of this City," after
taking into consideration the very
bad' condition of most all the main
strepts leading out of this city and
nlso tho pikes for sonic distance
out itito the country, would suggest
that it would be of much advantage
to tliisj city to have the best roads
and stroets that wo can get for the
amount of money wo are able to
invest for that purpose.
Anothor very important tiling for
the people of this city to do would
be to adopt n strictly cash basis in
buying nnd selling, or a "pay-up"
every thirty days and bo sure to do
it, This rule, if strictly adhered to
would bo thq turning point in ninny
u man's life. If wo had these two
suggestions fully carried out wo
would seo our city blossom liko a
rose. Dr. J, F. Loekhart.

GREAT SHOW NEXT WEEK
After more extensive and sensa
tional publicity than has fallen to
tho lot of any other theatrical en
terprise, D. W. Griffith's "Tho
Birth of a Nation" will open a two
dny's engagement next Monday af
ternoon at tho Tabb Theatre Tho
first class, metropolitan production
is .guaranteed to be the one shown
here, carrying two baggage cars of
equipment, a symphonic orchestra
of musical experts, and a complete
traveling organization of 50 people.
Many circumstances have con
spired to make "The Birth of a Na
tion" tho most widely discussed
play in the world. Suggested by
Thomas Dixon's Southern novel, it
embraces a far wider scope than
"The Clansman" play. Mr. Grif
fith's new art covers 150 years of
history and pictorinlizcs the great
est events of the war between the
states ns well as those of Recon
struction. Lincoln, Leo and Grant;
tho early gjpries .of the . Confeder
acy; the devastation of Gen. Sher
man's march to tho sea; tho awful
siege of Petersburg; tho signing of
peace at Appomatox the assassin
ation of tho President in Ford's
Theatre, and. thossuccecdjng orgy
of hato nnd oppression of the
South these personage and inci
dents pass rapidly before tho en
thralled spectator and lead up to
tho terrific climax of Part II, which
is devoted to what has been styled
"the second struggle between the
North and the South," a struggle
caused by the attempt to impose
carpetbagger rule upon the con
quered States. Tho wild adven
tures and achievements of the Klu
Klux Klan dominate., the final
s -
scenes, 'which yield a happy ending
df a double romance of Southern
and Northern sweethearts. '
WHAT WE WAY EXPECT
As an instance of whnt we may
expect soon in tho newspaper busi
ness may be eited the following
from tho Climax-Madisonian, pub
lished at Richmond, known ns one
of the best country weeklies in
Kentucky :
"We issue this week only four
pages. The paper supply of the
country is so low thnt it can scarce
ly he obtained at any price. We
hnvo n carload bought but wo can
get only such as is sent out by the
mills. You mny soon see the pa
pers of this country printed on yel
low paper."
ACCEPTS AG5NCY
Mr. S. S. Pinney has -accepted
tho agency for the nationally ad
vertised Overland car, nnd is ready
to demonstrate its superiority over
any other modcrnto priced car on
tho mnrkct. Fully equipped, elec
tric starter and lights, demountable
rims, etc., make it a most desirable
machine. Mr. Pinney is a hustler
nnd tho agency could not have been
placed in better hands.
, SELLS FINE COLT

u yearling colt to Ed Willis, who
represented Fousheo Br,os., of Lex
ington, by Peter Montgomery, dam

JOIN IN THE
' MOVEMENT
A Home-Coming Week is Being
Suggested Throughout the
Grand Old State.
It is being suggested in papers
throughout tho State that wo have
a Homo-Coming Week. About ten
years ago thoro wns a Home-Com-ing
Week celebrated and thousands
of Kentuckinns who had moved to
other stntes were induced to return
to the Old Kentucky home and re
new the relationships of othor days.
It has been suggested by tho papers
of Winchester that the last week in
Mny or tho first week in June
would be a splendid time for this
gathering. Of course, all who come
back would wish to visit their home
town first nnd then possibly pay a
visit to Lexnigtonj "the Hub of the
Bluegrass," and then Louisville. It
would bring back tender memories
of the days of long ago and afford
pleasure to thousands. We would
suggest thnt some organization get
back, of this matter and let us join
hands with other counties nnd help
make the Ilome-Coming Week of
this year one grand success.

Complicated.
While Washington reports indi

the most successful since tho school
started four years ago. and the
large building was taxed to its ca
pacity. DEMOCRATIC PROSPERITY
The Lexington Lender in a pre
face to printing Dun's Review for
the week says:
"There appears to be no pros
pect of letting down in the extraor
dinary business conditions through
out the country. With increasing
prices in all lines, the demands up
on the mills and factories continue
to tax their capacity. People seem
to have plenty of money with which
to buy and the banks are well sup
plied with idle cash."
And yet the Leader and all its
Republican companions insist that
the Democratic tariff is mining tho
country and that nothing can save
the country but a high protective
tariff, framed by Republicans. Con
sistency, thou art indeed a jewel!
