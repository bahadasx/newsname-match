It-would be suicidal for the Demo

Friends of Senator James and Gov.
Stanley have held a conference and
agreed to put forward Gov. Stanley
and Judge C. A. Hardin, of Harrods
burg, for temporary and permanent
chairmen of the coming State conven
tion. It is pretty -generally agreed
that the four delegates at large will
be Senators James and Beckham,
Gov. Stanley and Hon. Jas. B. Mc
Creary. One of the April brides finished a
course in domestic science a week
before her marriage. Senator Smoot
says no girl is ready to manage a
home until she knows how to cook.
Hopkinsville has many young wives
who are model housekeepers, because
they were taught home economics.
And there is hardly a month that
some outsider does not come in and
gobble up these treasures. They
know that even the girls have caught
the Hopkinsville idea of being satis
fied with nothing short of the best
and the Hopkinsville girls have al
ready learned that domestic science,
r.t not the best, is at least the most im
portant of all the sciences to a hungry
husband.

Senator Ollie James Aids Gov.
Stanley in State Conven
tion Work.
HARMONY IS RESTORED
Governor Is to Be Chairman
of Convention and Judge
Hardin State Chairman.
Louisville, Ky., April 9. The silver
lining is not showing through the
clouds which have overhung the state
democracy's skies for the last two or
three weeks. The sterling back
ground has been there all the time,
but it took Ollie James, United States
Senator, and Gov. Stanley to find and
show it to the democrats of the state.
Now they see it as- plainly as the nose
on your face since the two state lead
ers held a conference last Thursday
night at Lexington's pride hotel.
The clouds first appeared when
Percy Haly, Senator J. C. W. Beck
ham, Tom Rhea, Urey Woodson and
Rufus Vansant, all affiliated with the
dry wing of the party, held a meeting
in Cincinnati and backed Vansant for
temporary chairman in the face of the
fact that precedent of recent years
decreed the democratic governor
should deliver the keynote address
and preside over the preliminary ses
sions of the state convention. For a
time it looked as though these "insur
gents" might be able to control the
convention, making it embarrassing
for Governor Stanley.
Since the senior senator and the
state exocutive met, scanned the skies
and pointed out to the democratic vot
ers of the State "fJIilriucliquarTer
to look to find the rift in the clouds, a
most hopeful feeling has manifested
itself in the hearts of the staunchest
democrats.
Prior to that time, the Vansant-Rhea-Haley-Woodson
combination
had arranged it that Vansant should
be made committee chairman and that
J. C. W. Beckham, the senator who
was hissed from the stage of Keith's
theater here last August at a demo
cratic state convention, should be
chosen temporary chairman.
On Friday night Governor Stanley
and Senator James conferred in
Louisville. Reports which they had
received from the state, after two days
had been given to acquaint the people
of the commonwealth with the agree
ment at the first meeting, caused the
two leaders to feel even more opti
mistic than before. Basing his state
ment on what he had heard from
various parts of the state the senator
said:
JAMES FAVORS JUDGE HARDIN,
"Governor Stanley will be elected i
temporary cliairman of the state con
vention and he ought to be. The state
administration will beondorsed for
its achievements as it deserves to be. '
I am in hearty accord with the move
ment to place Judge Hardin, of Har
rodsburg at the head of the demo
cratic state committees. He is an
able jurist, indentified with no faction, '
and a democrat who measures to ev
ery requirement of that responsible
position. With such a program suc
cess is assured in advance." 1
Voicing his belief that the earlier
opposition would be melted beneath
the sun shining through the clouds,
Senator James declared:
"I am firmly convinced there will
not be a ripple to mar the harmony of '
tho coming state convention and that
' tho party will emerge stronger than
if has been in years, to roll up a big
majority for our matchless leader, 1
President Wilson, no matter whom
tho republicans place against him. '
The republicans have been taking the
flattering unction to themselves that
the democrats of Kentucky would
liave a big row, but in this they are
doomed to disappointment. Mark
what I tell you, the state democracy
will rally to Governor Stanley and
Judge Hardin, and, led by them, the
party will achieve an old-time victory
in Kentucky next November. ' 1

Judge Henderson Returned
To Finish Up a Few
Cases.
Judge Carl Henderson returned
Friday and wound up circuit court
matters.
One case required a jury. Sam

pleaded guilty. A jury of seven law
yers and other bystanders to complete
the panel gave him two years.
A new trial was given Leslie Wag

fendant then entered a plea of assault

CAN'T TRUST
FISCAL COURT
Executive Committee of the
Good Roads Association
Takes Action.
Insisting that the holding of a bond
issue election under the present con
ditions would be a needless waste of
the taxpayers' money, the executive
committee of the Good Roads Asso
ciation of Henderson county asks the
county court whether there is any
way to legally call off the election and
recommends that it be done if possi
ble.
If the election cannot be called off,
the executive committee believes that
the bond issue should be voted down.
The committee bases this action on
numerous petitions and resolutions
by the voters and taxpayers. Some
of the petitioners went so far as to in
sist upon the resignation of Judge S.
A. Young and Engineer S. H. Kim
mel and all expressed an unwilling
ness to vote another dollar road
money if it is to be spent by the pres
ent road department, the court having
refused to provide a road commission.

FALLBACK
Under Cover of Night And
Straighten Line Before
Verdun.
OFFENSIVE DIES DOWN
German Attack Northwest of
Verdun Results in Heavy
Teuton Losses.
London, April 10. The Bethin
court salient, which for weeks had
projected like a wedge into the Ger
man lines northwest of Verdun, has
been evacuated by the French.
The evacuation was carried out un
der cover of darkness and without
interference with the French through
the move, have been enabled to
straighten out their line which now
runs from the corner of the Avocourl
wood to the south of the crossing of
the Bethincourt-Esnes and Bethin-court-Chattancourt
roads.
Violent attacks delivered by the
Germans against the new positions
found the French lines unwavering
and all of them were repulsed, except
between the Avocourt wood and the
Forges brook, where the Germans
succeeded in entering the Freuch
trenches, but were almost immediate
ly driven out.
Northeast of Verdun and around
Pepper hill and on the Douaumont
Vaux sector, the Germans heavily
bombarded. French positions, but
were unable to launch any Infantry
attack in the face of the fire of the
French guns. The capture of the 15Q
meters of German trenches southwestV
of Douaumont is reported by Paris.
On the rest of the lines in France
and Belgium artillery duels alone
have been in progress.
The offensive of the Russians
against the Germans in northwest
Russia has simmered down to n. ",ual
bombardments and bombing attacks
by the German and Russian aviators.
Artillery actions in the Lake Narcoz
region continue and an infantry attack
by the Germans here was repulsed by
the Russian fire.
Considerable fighting between the
Turks and the Russians has taken
place in the Black sea littoral with
the Turks the aggressors. These at
tacks against the Russian entrench
ments on the right bank of the Kara
dere were without result. The Rus
sians are pushing their advance
against the Ottomans in the upper
Tchoru river region.
Along the entire Austro-Italian
front the artillery of both sides has
been active.
