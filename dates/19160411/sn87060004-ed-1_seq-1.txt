Price of Gasoline
Washingtou in firmlv convinc
ed that the.S'audard 0.1 Com
pauy might, if it chose, piev6ut
the conslant rise in the price of
gasoline. One sucgeFsionia that
an embargo be placed upon gas
oline, thereby shutting off the
European market. In view of
the Government's position in
relation to the shipment of all
other kinds of supplies to the
war countriep, it is not likely
that attempts to regulate the
price of gasoline will be along
the embargo route. Another
legislative proposal favors the
asiztng of the properties of the
Standard Oil. Another congress,
man tbinki the situation mieht
be saved if the Interior Depart
ment would get busy and dig a
lot of oil wells throughout the
country. The automobile manu
facturers are at x'ocs that some,
thing drastic be done, as the

DOORS CLOSED FOR
CHURCH SERVICES
At seven o'clock sharp the Club
room was closed and all boys present
were requested to attend some church.
By a vote it was decided that all go
together to the Methodist church.
This was done with the best of
spirit, and it is thought . that every
Sunday night the Wub room will be
closed.
This shows the correct attitude of
the boys and it is believed it will be
met with favor by the citizens of
our town.

The Minimum Wage
The Nolan bill provides for a
minimum wage of $90 per month
for employees of the federal
government. The hearings on
the bill have developed some
startling conditions in the public
service. Although the standards
of living and general wage scales
have been changed time and
again to meet conditions in the
business world, many laborers
employed by Uncle Sim, are
working on the same basis estab
lished fifty-five years ago. A
grave digger at Arlington ceme
tery was brought before the com
mittee, and it was found that he
has been receiving $40 per
month. On this sum heattempts
to support a large family. It
develops that this man has been
providing the last resting qlaces
for Generals, Admirals and other
military heroes to whose mem
ories beantifnl monuments' haye
been erected. The investigation
also discloses that there are n
great many people in the Gov
ernment service for $720 per an
num, with no probabilities of in
creased pay. Considerable pres
sure is being used in the hopes
that Congress will set an example
to the rest of the nation, by
establishing a minimum wage
that will provide at least a de
cent living for its most menial
employees.
Would Return to
Battling With Swords
. jinil Boydnets
Wm. Marconi says German advan
tage in science has now been over
come by the Allies, who possess equal
if not better flying machines, subma
rines and big guns. He mentions
the possible discovery of electrical
apparatus which would send waves,
exploding powder at a. distance. If
successful this would mean a rever
sion to sword and bayonet fighting,
as it would be unsafe to be near any
explosive.
Hudson Maxim on
Length of the War
New York In a letter to the
Times, Hudson Maxim says he be
lieves the war will last from three to
five years yet. He points out that
the Germans are entrenched in ene
mies' countries and adds that it re
quires three times as many men and
the expenditure of three times as
much ammunition to disentrench a
well-entrenched enemy as it does to
hold a stiongly entrenched position.
Mr. Maxim says that all of the talk
about starving out Germany is emp
ty vaporing He concludes by say
ing:-
"England is unassailable in her is
olated position. She may possibly
lose Egypt, may possibly lose India,
but her oversea colonies cannot be
assailed; and should she lose Egypt
and India, England would yet not be
whipped. It is my prediction that
the war will last from three to five
years yet, and that it is more likely
to be seven years than three,"

"WHISKY AND
GUN" BLAMED
FOR CRIME
Christian Citizens Scored For
Not Aiding Grand Jury's
Investigation
Hopkinsville. Ky., April 8 lit
its final report, submitted today, the?
unristian County Grand Jury says
"We verily believe whisky and re
volvers are responsible for at least 90
per cent of the crimes we have in
vestigated " It also says that "idle
ness and laziness, with a disposition
to live upon the wages of others" is
also partially responsible for many
crimes. The grand jury criticizes citizense
of the county, saying that too many
of them are prone to "wink" at
crimes rather than assist in punish
ingfhe guilty. It states that it has
thoroughly investigated charges of
extravagance and graft made durinir
,.the road bond campaign recently and
tinds that these charges founded on
mere "rumors" and that no tangible
evidence of such irregularities was
presented to them. Consequently it
gives all county officials s clean bill
of health.
Wonderful Work
of Relief Makes
American Famous
Richard Harding Davis in the
Times says that the German govern
ment has invited H. O Hoover, the
American who has directed relief for
for the people of Belgians, to feed
and protect destitute people of Serbia
Mr. Davis says that Mr. Hoover,
acting is agent of the American peo
ple and of rrench and English gov
ernments, has each month distributed
to destitute Belgians $10,000,000.
Of this1, the money sent from America-,
even including the $4,000,000
donated by th Rockefellers, could
not have kept the Belgians alive for
seven weeks. Position of Serbia is
claimed to be most desperate. Help
that was expected from Italy has not
come and now at Brindisi, three
hours' steaming from Durazzo, there
are 18,000 tons of rice, flour and
sugar, sent from America, which the
Italian government has not forward
ed. Mr. Davis says the Germans
have stricken Serbia and already
2,000,000 hogs and cattle have been
driven out of the country into Ger
man territory, while Serbian people
are reduced to eating horse flesh.
