General Salazar, who has been liv

of the Huerta generals. He Is be

Salazar enjoys the reputation of'
being one of the ablest of the Mexi- j
can generals. It was reported here I
today by men who have been closely
Associated with him that he intends
to declare for Felix Diaz. It is known
that up to a short time ago Salazar
was n the sreatest poverty. He
complained bitterly that on account
of his ''persecution" by Americans he
was forced to live on the charity of
friends, a few days before his dis
appearance, however, he received a
large sum of money and repaid sev
eral debts he had Incurred.
There are a number of Americans
here who were on intimate terms
with the vanished general, who was
willing to admit individual Americans
to his friendship while never disguis
ing his hostility toward the Ameri-
iifl government. These men maintain
that salazar has a very large fol

, Senator Galllnger, the republican
leader in the senate, made public to
I night a letter from Senator Fall, who
has been on Ihe bonier reporting con
ditions to Hie minority senulors. Mr.
Fall analyzing the border guard, suld
the raid on Columbus was made pos
sible by a wide gap In the patrol, und
declared that he had been reliably In
formed that unless the American
nrmy was given full control of tho
Mexico Northwestern railroad within
a week from the date of his letter,
April 4, the expedition would have to v
be withdrawn.
Officials pointed out today that to
morrow was the day fixed for with
drawal by the senator's Informant,
ami thut Secretary lansing had for
mally announced thut the railroad
question no longer was a faotor In tha
situation. A full report on the Colum
bus raid has been ordered and will bo
made as soon as Colonel Riorum, who
commanded the garrison, returns
from Mexico.
Villa .May He Crippled.
As to Senator Fall's statement that
1 1
he was assured that Villa was not
w-ounded
It was said at the state de-
partment that all kinds of conflicting
r,,mors on this subject had come from
. h , r Mut that onlv todav Gen
eral Funston had reported the receipt
of another dispatch saying Villa had
been severely wounded in the right
knee.
Army officers tonight likened the
expedition in Mexico to a feather
duster, with the cavalry outposts aH
the "sweep," and the constantly!
lengthening line of communication an
the "handle." This handle, they said,
had become continually more slender.
This condition is believed to have
caused General Funston to suggest
drawing upon the border patrols In
strengthen the line.
