The communication follows:
"On the left bank of the river Mouse
the Germans yesterday evening deliv
ered an attack against, our positions
at I.e Morie Homme. This activity was
accompanied by the use of flaming
liquids. The attack was made from
the t'orbeau wood and was checked by
our curta'ns of fire and the fire of our
infantry, excepting on the east, where
the enemy secured a footing in a few
small elements of trenches.
"On the right bank of the Meuse the
Germans endeavored to expel us from
the trenches taken by us during the
past few days south of the village of
Uoiiautnont. This endeavor also saw
the Germans making use of jets 'of
flaming liquids. It was met with a
sanguinary check.
"There has been a violent bombard

Vaux and in the Woevre district.
"This morning a French air pilot
vanquished a German aeroplane which
fell within our lines near Badonviller.
The two enemy aviators were killed."
Line of Attack Diminishes.
The German general offensive
f gainst the French fortress of Verdun
began Sunday over a 13 mile front, is
being restricted in the latest fighting
to a two-mile front on the w-est side
of the river Meuse. Along these 3.500
yards of trenches the French thu3 far
not only have succeeded In barring a
further advance, of the Teutons on the
west bank of the river but also in
screening their artillery, which is rak
ing every German advance on the east
of the river.
The object of the present operations
Is the now historical Mort-IIomme, or
Dead Man's Hill, which bars the way
of the Germans to a further advance
west of the river. The operations be
gan yesterday when two German di
visions were launched from Bethin
court against Hill 304 on the left of
Iad Man's Hill, while two divisions

The Germans advanced in serried
ranks as on Sunday and their propor

The Germans are at the foot of Hill

incompatible with public interest to
submit to the senate all reports of in
vestigations made by the department
into the Standard Oil company since
the supreme court decree of dissolu

j Senator Kenyon had read to the sen

oil jobbers association at St. Louis
' petitioning congress to supplement the
j Sherman law to make effective the de
cree of dissolution against the Stand
ard Oil company and declaring it to
be the sense of the association that

Flan Army and Navy Aerodrome.
San Diego, Cal., April 11. Plans for
the establishment of a combined army
and navy aerodrome here at .which
military aviators of both services will
be trained have been formulated by of
ficials of the United States signal corps
aviation school at North Islands. These
plans, it was said authoritatively to
day, have received the endorsement of
Secretary of War Baker and Secretary
of the Navy Daniels and will be placed
before congress in the near future.
THE WAR TODAY
After the evacuation of Bethin.
court by the French, the Germans
threw several divisons of troops
against the new French line and a
furious battle is In progress. Tho
bombardment of the entire front
nest of the 3Iense is of Ir.ereaslnsr
intensity on both shies. South of
the Forces Brook, the Germans
met, with heavy losses.
The French are holding their
positions In the Calllette wood
which has been the scene of heavy
lighting for several days.
The British at St. Flo! have re
eaptored all of the trenches re
cently taken from them by the
Germans.
On the eastern front In the low.
er Stripa region, (he Russians
captured a German trench and
held it against connter attacks, In.
fllctlng heavy casualties on the
Germans. Great activity by aero
planes is reported from both sides.
In Asiatic Turkey, the Russians
have penetrated to the recion of
Diarbeikr, Armenia, and In the dis
trlct of Bitlis hare repulsed sever
al Turkish attacks. South of lake
I'ruiuiah, the Russians apparently
are overtaking the main Turkish
force.
The Italians have set on fire
with their big puns the town of
( oldonazzo, in the Sngana valley,
according to the Austrian ofticlal
report.
Siv British, one Norwegian and
one Spanish vessel have been sunk
by mines or torpedoes within the
last 24 hours.
The German assault on the de
fenses of Verdun is still centered
on the all-important key position
of Dead Mnn's Hill, west of the
flense. Advancing from Corbeanx
f wood, the Germans last nleht suc
ceeded in gaining a few elements
of French trendies.
In the sector between Donan
mont and Vaux the Germans also
renewed the attack, but gained
no success.
Paris regard the present at
tack of the Germans as their mi.
preme effort in this irreatest of
battles. French commentators
say it may mark the close of the
Verdun campaign, whatever the
outcome. The general offensive
launched on Sunday over a 13
mile front Is represented as one
of the heaviest blows struck by
the Germans struck in the war.
It is now reported from Paris
that the main onslaught tins di
minished In extent, being limit
ed to a front of about two miles
between Cunileres and Hill 'o.
301.
Berlin tlews the Verdun opera
tions confidently, pointing to the
German gain, the losses inflicted
on the French, and saying more
than 8G,000 French hae been rup
tured. With the exception of the Ter
dun sector, no military operations
of particular significance are re-ported.
EATH RUMOR
MAY RE RUSE
OF VILLISTAS
Military Authorities Believj
Story May Be Trick of
Fleeing Foe.
CONTINUE ON HUNT
No Let-Up Made by Ameri
cans in Pursuit Villa
and His Gang.
Columbus. . tf April ll-Wl-Itary
authorities recognize that re
ports of the bandit chieftain's
death may be another ruse to
throw the Americans off what has
been termed a "hot trail" but nev
ertheless the fliers said, no fend
ency is manifested to belittle the
report.
"There seems no doubt that VII
la was wounded,'' said Lieutenant
Dargne. "Conversations with na
tives and with physicians have
convinced me that he was shot
through both legs, one of them be
ing broken by a bullet, while an
other shot lodged in his stomach.
A man In that condition, withont
medical attention could scarcely
live long.'
The aero corps planned to send
an aviator today to scout over the
region in which the natives have
reported Villa was buried in an
attempt to find the grave, the fliers
said.
El Paso, April 11. With no official
advices for days of the whereabouts
of the advance guard of American cav
alr pursuing rxanciseo Villa, officials
of the Carranza government in Juarez
today sought to obtain information
over the American troops.
Army officers at Fort Bliss believe
when the American commanders get in
touch with General Funston they win
report that the American troops have
engaged the Villa forces in battle. Re
ports that a battle has been fought
with Villa bandits south of Satevo
were current early today but there was
nothing to confirm these reports.
Dodd's 3fen Believed Safe.
There was little apprehension over
the position of the advanced forces for
it was confidently felt at Fort Bliss
that Colonel Dodd's men could fight
themselves out of any uncomfortable
position.
Scouts and refugees with knowledge
of the country south of Parral say that
the American troops will find it diffi
cult to operate in any numbers against
Villa in the district where he is now
fleeing.
The Arrieta brothers are said to be
fortifying the city of Durango but foi
what purpose lias not been indicated.
Plot is I nearthed.
A plot of wide dimensions, hatched
in El Paso and backed by the same
people who are financing Felix Diaz, is
believed by the police to have been
unearthed following the arrest last
night of 15 Mexicans accused of being
implicated in the flight across the
border of General Ynez Salazar.
Agents of the department of justice
aided the police in making the ar
rests, most important of which were
General Marcelo Caraveo and Gen
eral Ignacio Morelos Zaragoza, who
like Salazar, were among the best
known and trusted of the late Vic
toriano Iluerta lieutenants.
The prisoners were grilled for the
better part of the night by the police
and secret service officials. The fol
lowing story was pieced together
from their admissions and is believed
by the authorities to be substantially
correct:
Dissatisfied With Diaz.
The backers of Diaz, it is said, be
came dissatisfied because his own mil
itary reputation was small and he
had no man with his movement in
whose generalship the Mexican people
had confidence. They were also anx
ious to reinforce the Diaz campaign
in southern Mexico by a similar in
surrection in the northern part of the
republic. A soldier was wanted of

WISCONSIN FARMERS
WILL SUPPLY DRUGS
Madison, Wis., April 11. The Euro
pean war is teaching Wisconsin fann
ers that they are in position to supply
many ot the needs which hitherto
have been met by importations from
foreign countries. State pharmaceu
tical laboratory officials have already
found sources of several much-used
drugs in Wisconsin's marshes and
roadsides. The field cultivation of
some of th weeds or plants from
which drugs are produced probably
will be recommended.

damaged, was delivered today to
the American embassy.
Washington, April 11. When the
cabinet meeting Droke up today it be
came known that the submarine sit-'
uation had again been gone over very
fully but that the decision not to go
further until the additional evidence
due Thursday on the steamer St. Paul
still prevailed.
It was indicated that the president
and the cabinet were still thinking
not about the destruction of the Sus
sex alone but of the accumulation of
cases of destruction of ships since
Germany gave her last assurances
and it still appeared that whatever the
United States might do would be
based largely upon that feature.
Secretary Lansing was able to In
form the president and the cabinet of
the essential points of Germany's con

blameless for the attacks on the

admits firing a torpedo at the Patria.

(via Mexican telegraph to

Renewed reports have been

r ershing that Francisco Villa
i i
is dead and buried. These
reports are under investiga
tion. Meanwhile the hunt
for the Villa bandits is pro
ceeding with renewed vigor
with the arrival at the front
of General Pershing.
Mexicans, jtho had seen Tflla on
Ws flight south said that the bandit
looked thin and emaciated a week
ago. Beports, however, are con.
flicting. One fairly good authority
stated that Villa was able to walk
the first day after he received his
wound, which indicated that no
bones were broken.

They are unsubstantiated by the
latest dispatches to the war and
state departments. The circum
stantial reports of Villa's recent
injury, however, and the trials of
his loy and hurried flight gave
some color to the possibility-that
he may have been unable to snr
tIvo the hardships in bis disabled
condition.
Official estimates of the number of
troops in Mexico and on the border
available for an emergency were giv
en at the war department today. Gen
eral Scott, chief of staff, announced
that 18,565 troops now constitute the
border patrol.
General Pershing has about 12.000
men in Mexico, including those hold
ing his line of communications.
How greatly the mobile army has
been drawn upon for the Mexican ex
pedition and border service was also
disclosed by General Scott. He esti
mated that only 4,000 troops remain
in the United States not engaged on
the border.
General Scott also stated today that
no word of the chase of Villa had been
received for several days either from
General Pershing or General Fun

The department asked for details of
General Pershing's conferences with
Generals Herrera and Gutierrez, but
General Funston telegraphed today

were said to report conditions quiet
