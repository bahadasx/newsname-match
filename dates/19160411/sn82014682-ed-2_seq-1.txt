stopped. ' according to Purser Robert

- "We haven't any hides on board this
voyage." said Mr. Acheson, "because
they aren't exporting them any more.
They want all the leather they can
get to make shoes for the Australian
soldiery." . . ,
This !s the first time in many
months that an Oceanic liner has not
passed through with many hundreds
of bundles of hides in her hold. The
government of the commonwealth" has
' evidently .placed a ban on exportation
cf leather. Plenty of wool and skins

-The latclutring to Hawaii will al
ways bo hanging out for the Pacific

friend return." said Albert P. Taylor,
secretary - of the Hawaii Promotion

what effect the coming of the Pacific

service came last night from San
Francisco. ' .
"With one line taken off and an
other line crippled, the prospects for
a good tourist season this year did not
look bright The coming of the Pa
cific Mail boats will do much to help
out. From ail appearances the Pacific
Mail i will change the tiavel from a
subnormal summer to a normal one. ,
' "With the three boats in operation
the travel oa the Pacific will not be
so congested. Ha wall will secure
more tourists and the public in' gen

would have three ships on the run to
the Orient the situation was at the
same point we bad last year, mlnud
the Pacific Mail boats, and prospects
for a good travel did not appear to be
bright.' ' :,-
"The Promotion Committee -'will be

everything possible to help along in
the progressive movement started by

VvASHINGTOX, U. (.V .March 31.
The sugar situation ha3 become mud
dled. Democratic senators who be
lieve 'sugar should La placed on th?
free list are responsible. The entire
problem must be threshed out ia t :
senate and mulled over la conference
before a solution 'of the problem I;
found. ' '."
Whatever the plnzl net cutcc-
may be, the protective duty cf c
cent per pound will remain. The. .1
might be a time limit of four jf-:j
attached to the legislation, but th.t
means little under exi3ting.cond!ticr.3.
The-143,000,000 In revenues derive 1
from this tax on sugar will be mcr?
badly needed in 192(i than at present.
It surely is a safe prediction that g:v
ernment expenditures will ccntlr.
to grow each year and the necessity
for receipts will remain.
Why Change Was Made.
- Here is an explanation of the can? ;
leading up the the raudJIe:
When the sugar repeal bill was i:?.
der discussion in the House, Sena'.r
Simmons and other Democratic lead
ers took the subject up. They tenta
tively, agreed that In order to provld i
for the extraordinary expenses incur
red by Increasing the army and l -building
the navy, the sum cf 70,CC0,
000 must be realized from taxation cf
sugar. They favored a consumption,
or production, tax of one-half a cent
per pound but abandoned the plan t -cause
It proved extremely unpor'-!:-,
being brought right down to the "re :
man's breakfast table." Then It w:
determlned to fix the rate at oita a'
a half or one and three-quarters c
per pound, thereby virtually restc i
the duties carried in tlie Payne-A.
rich act
Other Senator Object
When news of. thi3 ccntemp!:'. '.
action became noi3ed abroad -sever. '
senators pounced on the, finance cc
mittee and declared they would r. :
approve that course. They went fur
ther and said they wouIJ cprcse r .
conditional repeal. They drrlrcl
mere temporary extension until ccr.
tions returned to normal.
With this. party s;'.:t In s'r.ht
caucus cf Democratic scr.atcri v.
