time after time they were slaughtered

pieces that cut groat gaps in the ranks
and left for the French infantry Mttlc

of the nttark on th entrenchments on
Forces creok yesterday indicate that
nothing, save perhaps the first attacks
on Douaumont fort, have proved so
costly to the Kaiser's armies.'
At another part of the western bank

from Paris and Berlin conflict widely
as to the exact extent of the French
leases.

Berlin says that the Oermana there
attacked near Haucourt, and drove
the Gallic defenders hack over a front
of two thousand yards, to a distance
two thirds of a mile south of the vil

claim that the Crown Prince there cap

LEADER
TO LEAVE AT ONCE
(AasooUUd rrass by rsderal Wtralass.)
WASHINGTOX. April 11. General
Oavira, comsiiudint of the Carranza
parrison at Juarez, laat night issued a
formal statement declaring that the
Carranr.istas are now "prepared to
control the situation, including the
Vilja feature, if the Americans will
leave the country."
Thia is the first official intimation
from any of the Carranciata leaders,
of their evident desire to have the
American troops under General Per
shing leave Mexico at onoe, and. has
silence, 1 local officials who un to the
time of the receipt of that message
were Ucluring that Carranxa and his
officer have been cooperating with
American troops.
Say Border Is Quiet
It Is true that a late statement from
the war department announced that
the "border is quiet, and there is no
evidence of any intentiqn on the part
of the American commanders to with
draw from the field."
At the same time despatches from
Columbus, New Mexico, announced
that "American soldiers here are slump
ing upon. their anna, while heavy pat
rola are guarding the atreeta of the
town. The gffn racks are unlocked ami
the rifles are ready for instant service.
Beporta of contemplated bandits raids
upon -the place are aaid to be the cause
of these lextraordinary precautions."
May Set Dead Una
The latest report Is that a "dead
line" has been sot. presumably at the
sugKestlon of the OarransiBtaa, 1eyond
which the American Column ia not to
go in pursuit of General Vi la. Both
ecretary Lansing and Becretary Baker
refused to comment' on the story that
an aurecnient had teen reached to thu
effect with Carraniv
It is rumored that no surprise would
occasioned if the Carranzistas
should soon net a date whn they thiuk
the Americiins should withdraw, leliev
ing that the purpose of the expedition
has been accomplished in the defeat
and scattering of the Villa forces.

The three fine vnsslsC luTibli, Ecu
ador ind Venezuela, were purchased by
the Pacific Mail lorn the West Indian
Mail, the Dutch line, fir 1 100,00)
each. The first is of 3448 tons, the sec
ond of :i.")17 tors snd the third of
3444 tons, virtually the sime sice.
Sal Announced In March
Announcement of their sale to the
Pacific Mail was mtd.e ii Amsterdam
the middle of March. ' Prior to that
time, howevei, Kan Francisco news
papers hail stated they had been sold
to W. It i;ace & Co., which is associ
ated with the American international
Corporation in the ownrrah'vt of the
Pacific Mail, the two great firms hav
ing bought the stock of the Southern I
Pacific. Other
imports were they hadi
been sold Norse
Th- Venezuela cleared from Amster
dam for San Francisco March 18, and
the Ecuador was to follow Ss soon as
she m refitted. The Columbia arrived
at Baltimore March 13 from New York.
These (sWs are not so large as tho
Hig Man huria and Mongolia of the obi
Msil line, which were the greatest ves
aels in these seas except for the Hill
liner Minnesota. The Manchuria ami
Mongolia are of 8730 tons net. Both
are in the Atlautic war trade.
Old Fleet Waa Strong
In the old .lays the Mail had the big
sisters ami the Korea, Siberia, China,
Persia and Nile, operating uader a
joint schedule with th Toyo Kisen
Kaisha. The Hig Four were aold to the
International Mercantile Marine, tho
Atlantic Transport line; the China is
under the China Mail flag, the Persia
under the T. K. K. flag, andMhe Nile
continues to be use. I as a British trans
port somewhere in the Orient or Med
iterranean. Last sailing of a Mail vessel from
Honolulu was that of the Manchuria,
the largest of the fleet, September 119,
when she departed for San Francisco.
Last fall the (irace line and the new
ly-organi.el Americuu International
hough t I. M. stock of the Southern
Pacific, thus taking over the Panama
fleet.
Boeumption Foreshadowed
Hecentlv the small Panama steamer
PeniiNv l uuia was despatched to Yoko
hama direct from Han Francisco, not
calling here, with general cargo. This
was taken as foreshadowing a possible
resumption of the old service, but it
was stated in San Francisco that the
sailing wan an experiment.
1n"7his ireent announcement the
hand of the International corporation
can be seen plainly. Few companies of
recent yenr have been so significant as
this. On its board are some of the
leading financiers of the States. It was
I forme I to fuithcr American trade in
W. B. Grace a Co. partners with It la
the Pacific Maib are too well known 4n v.';
the steamship Bold to d- comment.- '
They are one of th strongest American '
companies, and are growing -stronger '
every day. In no field could American
trade be helped so greatly as .by re
establishing an United 8tates merchant "
marine in the PaciSc, a fact of which
the associated companies were, aware.
Besides, the trade Is Yry profitable,
ami will be stable when the bottom ha
dropped out of many of the new war
routes. . . ,
How Island Will BnSt
Immediate benefit t the Island will
be in aiding to relieve congestion of
freight in the Orient, which has In
creased so that great difficulty is being
experienced in getting merehandise
(iiirmies snd Japanese - and Chinese
foods in particular should move much
more easily now. There should bo
plenty of freight offering to San Fran
cisco from Honolulu, although th ves
scls probably will be ' able to bring
little here from the Coast, a they
would fin with through cargo for. th
Far Kust. . .
It is presumed that a Joint schedule
with the T. K. K. will be arranged, a
heretofore. P. M. vessels formerly eel
led at Honolulu. Yokohama.. Kobe. Na
gasaki, Manila, Hongkong, Kseluuir,
Shanghai. Yokkaichi, Shijnxu, although
each vessel did not make all these
ports.
Old P. M. Ia Kept Allv 1
The old company wa kep alive 're
cently when sale of th fleet to W. R.
drnce & Co. was rescinded, a formal
measure, so as to keep th fleet intact.
It was to be operated jointly by Grace
and the International. The Internation
al paid $1,230,000 for the Panama
fleet. - k ,
Within a day or two, now, discus
sion will begin as to the retirement of :
the Pacific Mail last year, because of
the Seamen's act, a It waa stated by
the company. In view of the r-ed-t
ranee into the overseas trad by th
reorganized company th question 1
certain to be opened.
Honolulu can afford to smile and let
the sea lawyers talk. Th Pacific Mail
is coming back.
That the Pacific Mail would resum
operations out of San Francisco oa an
even larger scale than before it tern
porary withdrawal was indicated by
the rapid rise early in March ia tho
shares of the company. On th New
York stock Exchange th share we
quoted at 18, 26 and 2Mi, aud 29
within a few day.
Further Purchases Ee ported
The general advaoc la the bare
of the company was accompanied by ru.
mora of the further purchases of ship
and even greater financing than haa
been announced, which might possibly
carrv rights to the stockholders.
The general advance In th price of
Pacific Mail stock revealed a pretty bit
of financing and brings to light th
fact that tho American International
oiporatiou aad W. B, Grace ft Co.
whirl, .jointly purchased th assets of
the Pacific Mail Company after th
sa'e of its four big)iners to the Ameri
can International Marin made a re
markable bargain. ,
