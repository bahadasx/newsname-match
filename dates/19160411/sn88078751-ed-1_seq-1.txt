standing is. Villa haa been reported
as having arrived on the outskirts of
Parral and sent in emissaries to ob
tain supplies to sound sentiment to
determine if he could rally the ariried
forces of that place to his standard.

headquarter officers have information
inclining them to bollevo that Colonol
Dodd, with His picked detachment of
troopers, was the first American col
umn to reach that point, which Is not
far from the border between the
states of Chihuahua and Durango.
Anti-American sentiment 1b spread
ing in the section Villa is entering.
This was shown by the confirmation
of the news that the Arietta brothers,
formerly identified with the bandit
eeneral, have inflicted ?l,00O,00O loss
on an American concern by burning
the big ' lumber plant of the Com
panla Madera, In the state of Du
rango. Applied the Torch.
Shouting, "Down with the Grin
goes," the Arietta bandits made a
raid upon the plant and deliberately
applied the torch. Hiram Smith, pres
ident' of the company owning the
plant, received advices telling of the
raid." Villa has been trying to reach
this section of Durango, where bands
ot outlaws, formerly of hlB command,
have been terrorizing the residents.
Ho has sent ahead word to kill all
Americans and destroy all American
property.
News has just reached here of the
raid on a small garrison In a town
near Jiminoz. The Villlstas, retreat
ing Bon th beforo the driving American
advance, entered the town, attacked
the garrison, killed Colonel Plores,
commander of the Carransa troops,
and looted the place. They appealed
to the Carranza soldiers to Join them

doroo and his band of Villlstas to dis
cuss terms by which the Villa adher

TO BE COMPLETED THIS MONTH
Measure Includes the Administra

gram Two Dreadnaughts and Four
Battle Cruisers to Be Provided For.
Work On Designs of New Ships
Progressing Rapidly.
Washington, April 10. Work was
commenced today on the naval appro
priation bill, which includes the ad
ministration's $500,000,000, five-year
program for new fighting ships. Chair
man Padgett of the house naval sub
committee on appropriations hopes to
lay the completed measure before the
house by April 20.
While there are many legislative
features in the bill which will require
debate in the subcommittee and later
before the full committee, tho big
fight is expected to come over the
1917 program for capital ships. Sec
retary Daniels has recommended the
authorization of two dreadnaughts
and two battle cruisers. The navy
general board contended for three
battleships and four battle cruisers.
Present indications are that the sub
committee will compromise between
the two views and recommended two
battleships and four battle cruisers.
At the navy department work on
the designs of the new ships to be
authorized has progressed so rapidly
that much of the delay heretofore ex
perienced in advertising for navy
craft will be eliminated. Flans for
the battleships, large and small sub
marines, destroyers, gunboats, hos
pital ships and ammunition ships are
Virtually completed now. It will lake
only a few weeks after appropriation,
for the vessels Is made to lay specifi
cations beforo private builders.
Plans for the battle cruisers and
scout cruisers also are under way, but
will take some time to complete.
These vessels and the S00 ton class
submarines which Secretary Daniels
has added to his program are new
types for navy designers and it takes
time to work out details.
CAMP OVERCROWDED
Terrible Suffering Endured by British
Prisoners In Germany.
London, April 10. The foreign of
fice issued a report of the government
committee on treatment of British
prisoners of war at the German pris
on camp at Wittenberg during the
typhus epidemic last year. The re
port is signed by Justice Younger,
chairman of the committee. It is
based upon information collected
from repatriated prisoners of war. in
cluding Major Priestly and Captains
Vidal and Lauder, all officers in the
Royal army medical corps.
It disclosed a story of terrible suf
fering and privation under the most
cppalllng conditions. After describ
ing the location of the camp, which
occupies an area of about ten and a
half acres, the report says some 16,
000 or 17,000 prisoners are confined
therein. Including British, French.
Belgians and Russians.
The report states that "overcrowd
ing was most serious." Typhus ap
peared in December, 1914. "There
upon, the German staff, military and
medical, precipitately left the camp,
staying away until August, 1915. Dur
ing that period communications be
tween prisoners and guards was made
by guards or officers shouting Instruc
tlons from the outside wire entangle
ments of the camp.
The report adds: "All supplies for
the men were pushed Into the camp
over chutes, while food for the hos
pital and medical officers passed In
on a trolley, so as to avoid all contact
between the prisoners and the out
side world. No medical attention dur
ing the whole time was provided by
the German staff."
The camp conditions were too much
for the British medical officers. Two
of them, Major Fry and Captain Sut
cllffe, soon sickened and died o! ty
phus. Major Priestly saw delirious
men waving their arm, brown to tho
elbow with foecal matter. The pa
tients were alfve with vermin,

EVACUATED
Its Abandonment Decided On

KEW LINE WITHSTANDS ATTACK
Violent Assaults Made by the Crown
Prince's Army Are Repulsed by the
French In the New Trenches Dou-aumont-Vaux
Sector the Scene of a
Terrific Artillery Engagement Re
view of Operations On Other Fronts.
Paris, April 10. Tho village ot
Bethlncourt, forming the apex of tha
salient on the western bank of, the
Meuse, against which the Germans
have been pounding for days with
heavy artillery and with frequent In
fantry attacks, has been evacuated
by the French. Tiie new line with
stood the most furious assaults which
have been made by the crown prince's
army in many days.
From thn information now availa
ble it seems probable that the violent,
German attack on the western side
of the river, made simultaneously
with two extremely heavy assaults on
the eastern bank, thus practically
covering the whole Verdun front, was
undertaken by the Germans as soon
as they learned of the withdrawal
from Bethlncourt, In the hope ot find
ing the new French line In this sec
tor not yet strong enough to resist
them.
The evacuation of Bethlncourt has
been regarded by military experts
some days ago as a military neces
sity, since it was evident that tho
group of ruins representing the vil
lage was so situated as to make it
practically untenable under the pro
tracted fire of the German heavy artil
lery. The German commanders, an
ticipating the withdrawal, appeared
to have timed their attack, which
might almost be called a general as
sault on the Verdun front, to coincide
with the evacuation. But the evacua
tion had been safely completed in the
night, and troops were waiting In the
new trenches at the rear when tha
attack finally was made.
Violent Assaults Made.
The official announcement indicates
that the fighting was of a most vio
lent character. At one point on the
southern edge of the Bols AvocourU
a German assaulting column gained a
temporary footing in a French posi
tion, but was immediately driven out.
again by a counter attack.
The Germans, debouching from
their position In the Cumleres wood,
advanced in masses under the con
centrated fire of the French 75's and
mitrailleuses. The French fire broke
up their formations and they finally
withdrew, leaving hundreds of dead
on the field. Itepeated assaults were
made on Le Mort Homme, and hero
ngain the Germans lost heavily.
On the eastern hank of the river
the attack did not get beyond tne
stage of artillery preparation, tho
German troops not being able to leave
their positions. The Cote du Polvre
and the Douaumont-Vaux sector were
the portions ot the French line
against which the German artillery
directed its most violent fire on the
eastern bank, the French second lines
being shelled with particular thor
oughness. The offensive of the Russians
against the Germans In northwest
Russia has simmered down to mutual
bombardments and attacks by the
German and Russian aviators.
Considerable fighting between the
Turks and the Russians has taken
place in the Black sea littoral, with
the Turks the aggressors. Throe at
tacks against the Russian entrench
ments on the right bank of the Kara
ders were without result. Along tho
entire Austro-Italian front the artil
lery of both sides has been active.
The British steamers Adamton nnd
Avon have been sunk, presumably by
submarines.
