; Health officers from the leading rail
road centers and from the counties on
th?* northern border of Virginia will
meet State Health Commissioner Ennlon
i <>. Williams in this city on Tuesday to ,
j take immediate action on measures to '
! prevent the spread of infantile pa
ralysls in this State. -Telegrams were
: sent to these officers yesterday on the
return <>f the commissioner from the
, conference in Washington on infantile
paralysis.
The co-operation of the State Cor- !
1 poratlon Commission and the railroads j
to prevent the trawl from infected
1 areas of children who cannot produce
I satisfactory evidence that they have not
been exposed to the disease will be re
j quested by the hoard. Plans will be
'discussed aiso for guarding the various
automobile routes by which exposed
persons might be brought into the
State. j
ALTHOIUTIKS PI. A N SVSTUM
OF PAHTIAI. QL AHA.VTIM-: i
In view of the prevailing doubt as to
the method by which infantile paralysis
is carried, the State health authorities
expect to introduce a system of partial
quarantine for all children who come
into the State from infected areas, even
; though they produce certificates show
ing they have not been exposed to the
disease. A special regulation of the
j State Board of Health to this effect will
i probably be issued early next week.
l>r. Williams gave out the following
I statement last night regarding the
conference and its purposes:
"To date we have had fewer cases
of infantile paralysis than were re
1 ported in the corresponding months of
I 191 *>, and we are hopeful that we shall
| not be subjected to the disease in any
; thing like epidemic form. But, as it is
the policy of wisdom to take all pre
{ cautions, wo have been at work to-day
! on plans to supplement existing regu
| tions. and wish to have these considered
jointly by the Attorney-General, a rep
resentative of the Corporation Commls
i sion. local health officers and officers
j of the State hoard.
I "We are doing this because, if
M arrangements are to be effective, they
must be enforced by the united .action
, *.-f all those engaged in. transportation
or charged with the protection of the
public health. It has not been practica
ble to communicate directly with all
those whom we should like to have at
the conference on Tuesday morning at
11 o'clock, but we shall be glad to have
present health officers from as many
districts as can be represented. It is
'especially desirable that all the coun
ties on the northern border of the State
have their health officers in attend
ance."

RECALL OF TROOPS I

! PLANS NOT TO BE ALTERED
!
' May Hamper American Commi6- 1
sioners in Negotiations
With Mexicans.
.
WASHINGTON. August 19.?A rec
' ommendation from General Funston
that the American troops be withdrawn
j from Mexico was contained in a recent
report on the military situation made, at
the request of the War Department, and
: designed for use of the joint commis
sion which will discuss border prob
t letup. State Department officials do
! not attempt to disguise their regret
over the premature publication of On
l era! Funston's .conclusions, but they
| indicated to-day that it would nut
cause any alteration In the plans.
Officials realize, tt is understood, that ;
the most pressing matter for discus- :
[ slon by the commission, from the'
Mexican viewpoint, will be the ques
tion of withdrawal of General Persh- |
lnc's expeditionary f<->r<-c. Publication j
of the fact that funeral Funston be- |
lieves it wise to withdraw the troops
may hamper the American commission
ers, some officials think, in obtaining
whatever guarantees they may ask of
the Mexican government as to the se
curity of the border from bandit raids.
! It is believed th?* administration was
fully prepared to arrange for the re
call of General Pershing's force, since
both State and War Department oflt
j clals are understood to share the views
| expressed in General Funston's report.
There can be little doubt, it is now
said, that the withdrawal will be
I promptly agreed to when the commit
1 tee meets, the conferees then turning
their attention to the drafting of_ a
protocol to cover future border opera
tions, investigations of the cause of
bandit raids and such other matters
as they may wish to take up.
No intimation came from the White
House to-day as to when announce
ment of the American membership of
the commission might be expected. |

j Five negroes, three men and two

hanged by a mob. and another negro
was shot and killed by deputy sheriffs
near Jonesville. Fla., as the result of
the killing yesterday of Constable S.
G. Wynne and the shooting of Dr. L.
G. Harris by Huisev Long, a negro.
The lyncKfcd negroes were accused of
aiding Long to escape.
Posses consisting of seVeral hundred
men to-night are searching the woods!
about Newberry, eighteen miles from
here, for trace of Long. Further trou
ble is feared.
Dispatches from Newberry to-night,
said that the mob which lynched the
I've negroes was composed of about
2i)0 men and worked quietly and
rapidly. After gaining entrance to the
jail, they took the victims to a point
about a mile from town and hanged all
or. o^ie large oak tree. Not a shot
v as fired, the dispatch said. The negro
shot near Jonesville also was said to
have aided Long to escape.
Wynne and Dr. Harris were shot
when they went to Long's home, at
Newberry, early yesterday morning to
arrest him on a charge of stealing hog?.

being 1,300 bushels.
Virtually all the grain of the North

the railroad representatives had given
careful consideration to the chief ex- j

sense of the grave responsibility upon
their shoulders. In previous stages of
the negotiations, said Mr. Holden, tho
conference committee of managers had
constantly adhered to the policy of
arbitration as a fundamental principle,
a substitute for wasteful litigation.
He indicated its surrender would
amount to a denial of the right to be
heard, which does not exist under any
form of government known to the. race. |
Continuing, Mr. Holden said:
"The eight-hour day?I shall not at

arc willing for the Interstate Com'

are willing for the President of th<

of disinterested persons to arbitrate al
matters in dispute, if neither the In

ficient.
"Rut we have been met with a re

are now asked to surrender the princi

many millions per annum to tho cos!
of railroad transportation in this coun
try for the benefit of a class who art
among' the most highly paid and fa

demanded under the guise of a pleji

only an indirect plea for an enormous

Indian "war" like the ticklish chas<
for Tse Xe Gat last winter is ir. pros
pect at Bluff, Utah, the lonely Mormoi
settlement on the San Juan, in th<
"four corners" country, according t;
reports brought here by packers an?
range riders.
As was tho case before. Old Polk
rather of Tse No Gat, also known a
Match, is the trouble-maker. Ilis ban<
of renegade Piutes, long defiant of al
attempts lo make them live on th
Southern Ute reservation in this sectioi
of Colorado and regarded by tho Utal
scttleis as trouble-makers, is bohtm
him.
The latest riders from Bluff say tha
the citizens there are terrorized by th.
insolent and lawless attitude of th
Piutes and by reports of threats t<
white men daring to interfere wit)
them in their nomad existence.
A request for a troop of cavalry, i
is understood, has been sent out fron
Bluff, while representations have beei
made to the Indian Department, whicl
is expected soon to take further actio!
toward confining the Piutes to a re sol
vation.

WASHINGTON, Aucuat 15.?President
Wilson appealed to the railroad officials
j to-day to ahnndon their insistence on
arbitration of the dispute threatening a
nation-wide strike, and to accept his
plan of settlement, already agreed to
by the employees, because, in his opin
ion. the railroads aro contending for
a principle which If. seemingly is Im
possible to apply to the present sltua- '
tlon.
In one of the most dramatic scenes
known to the Whlto House in recent
years, the President declared to tho
hearts of ?r,.nnft.000.000 worth of prop
erties. assembled.at his summons:
"If a strike comes, the public will
know where the responsibility rests.
It will not be upon me."
A few minutes later he Issued a
statement, saying "the public has the
right to cxpcct" acceptance of his plan.
Refusing acceptance for tho present,
hut not giving a tlnal answer. Halo
Hold en, president of the Burlington
road, and spokesman for the thirty
threo railroad officials, urged tho presi
dent to uphold the principle of arbitra
tion, and declared his plan would "place
in peril all that has been accomplished
in tho peaceful adjustment of labor
controversies by methods of arbitra
tion."
A UDITIONA1, EXECUTIVES
CAM,ISO TO WASHINGTON
At the close of the conferenco Presi
dent Wilson summoned t>' Washington
additional railroad presidents from the
West, and the executives already here
told him they would confer among
themselves and return next week, prob?
ably on Monday. In tho meantime,
representatives of both the roads and
the employees \*IU remain here for in
formal conferences.
The situation to-night was described
by a rallroavl president as "not hope
loss, but grave." It will be at a stand
still until Monday at least. Discus
j sion of counterproposals and eompro
| mtses* were current, and serious con
sideration was given to tho possibility
l of government operation of the roads
: In case of a strike.
it was said on good authority to
; night, however, that many of the road
presidents ' looked upon the possibility
of a strike as more remote than at any
time since they came to Washington.
It still was considered possible that
| some of the powerful directors of the
roads would be <?alleil to Washington.
1 Both among the employers and the em
l ployees talk of arrangements for a
! strike continued, and for different rea
i sons each side thought if it cumo it
j would last less than a week.
i \\ hile President Wilson still was ad
j dressing the railroad executives, telling
them they faced "a condition, not a
principle," his statement to the eoun- ?
try reviewing his plan and characteriz
ing it as "a thoroughly practical and
fair program." was given out at the
White House. In tho statement, he
urged the adoption of the eight-hour
day because he "believed tho conces
sion right," suggested the creation by
Congress of a small body of men to
investigate the results, and urged the
I abandonment of tlio demand for time
and a half overtime pay by the men.
and the "contingent" proposals by the
! railroads.
IN SISTS ON A It IlITIt ATIOX
IN SETT1.INI. CONTROVERSY
Mr. 11 olden insisted on arbitration in
his reply to tho President because "It
is essentially the common right of
| every citixen of whatever condition in
life to be l.enrrand because experi
ence "his ri't the right to claim arbi
itra;ion as a method of settling con
: troversies beyond question." He argued
j that the eight-hour day is impracti
cable in railroading, and said the rail
i roads are willing for the Interstate
j Com :vrce Commission or any other
.disinterested body to arbitrate the
whole question. The demand for the
eight-hour day is. in reality, he de
clared, only an indirect plea for "an
enormous increase in wages," and said
that "in this instance for those de
manding a chance to refuse to sub
mit their demands to arbitration is
Indefensible."
W l.ee, head of the Brotherhood
I of Railroad Trainmen, gave out a
, brief statement to-night on behalf of
the men. pointing out that In accept
| lug President Wilson's plan tho em
;ployees surrendered "a very large por
lion of their demands," while the rail
j road companies "seem about as un
willing to accept suggestions from the
President of the United States as they
have in the past refused to consider
requests from Ihelr employees." He
added that the workmen would remain
here, but would take no further action
until released by^Mr. Wilson.
The railroad officials found en
couragement In two points in Presl
dent Wilson's plan. The first was a
hint thnt if the facts warranted, '
the Interstate Commerce Commission
might grant an increase in freight J
rates, and the second was a suggestion
that the eight-hour-day basis would T
be accepted only tentatively ,ai>4 ,,
