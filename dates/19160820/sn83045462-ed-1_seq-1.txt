LONDON, August 20. 2:34 a.m.
? Daily attacks by the British
against the German lines north
of the Somme, in France, are
having their reward.
The British have advanced
.long a front of eleven miles,
capturing an important ridge
verlookmg iiKepvai, nign
ground north of Pozieres and a
half mile of trenches west of
High wood, according to the official
statement issued by the war
dice at midnight. They captur1
796 prisoners in these opera,
ions.
Strong Pressure Exerted.
The pressure of the Anglo-French
re es has been exerted strongly reltly
^here the two forces join hands
. tween Guillemont and Maurepas.
The British have gained a footing in
the village of Guillemont. Berlin says
he Anglo-French attacks north of the
inline were repulsed, except around
Guillemont, where the German line was
hortened.
While not as active as the British on
* he Somme front, the French have
i?:ade more gains in the Verdun region.
Fighting took place on both banks of
rhe Meuse, the Germans attacking on
the left and the French on the right
Tank. The German advance was frustrated.
Paris says, and the French tfuc*eded
in gaining entire possession of
the village of Fleury. Counter attacks
by the Germans failed to dislodge the
French, Paris asserts.
Latest British Beport.
The text of the latest British state:rent
follows:
"Operations carried out yesterday at
various points along our front from
Thiepval to our extreme right south
of Guillemont, a distance of about
eleven miles, were most successful. As
a result we captured a ridge southeast
of and overlooking Thiepval and
northern slopes of high ground north
cf Pozieres. from which we get an extensive
view of the east and northeast.
"We are holding the western edge of
High wood and trenches made by the
enemy extending some half mile west of
the wood. We have advanced our line
half way to Ginchy and to the edge of
< Guillemont. where we hold the outskirts
of the village. Including the railway station
and quarry, which is of considerable
military importance. The number of prisoners
passed back to 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
as a result of these operations, is
16 officers and 780 of other ranks.
"Today, northeast of Pozieres. we made
a further advance on both sides of the
Pozieres - Bapaumg road for some 300
yards."
Early Report on Advance.
The earlier British official report of
yesterday says:
"Our success reported lasf night has
been maintained and extended. During
the night the enemy delivered several
very- determined counter attacks
against the positions we had captured.
Except on our extreme right,
where the enemy regained a little
ground, these counter attacks everywhere
were repulsed.
"From High wood to the point where
we Join up with the French we ad- !
vanced our line over a frontage of more I
than two miles for a distance varying be- I
tween 2^0 yards and 600 yards. We >
now hold the western outskirts of Guille- '
mont and a line thence northward to midway
between Delville wood and Ginchy,
and also the orchards north of Dongueva).
"Between High wood and the Albert Bapaurne
road we captured some hundred
yards of an enemy trench. East and
southeast of Mouquet farm we advanced
our line by some 300 yards. Between
Ovillers and Thiepval we pushes! forward
? on a front of over half a mile. As a
result of these operations several hundred
prisoners have been taken by us."
French Drive Germans Out.
The French have driven the Germans i
out of the portion of the trench north j
of Maurepas Into which they penetrated
Iti their counter attack Friday night,
according to the official statement issued
by the French war office last night.
The text of the statement follows j
"North of the Somme apart from an
operation of detail which permitted us i
to eject the enemy from the portion of
the trench he penetrated last night
north of Maurepas, the day has been ]
quiet. Our troops actively pressed forward
their work of consolidation on the
conquered front. The artillery actions
were of small importance in conse- ,
que.-.-e of the bad weather.
"In the Argonne we exploded a mine
which wrecked the enemy's advanced
works at Vauquois.
"On the right bank of the Meuse artillery
fighting continues actively in
the Pleury-Vaux-Chapitre sector. There
has been i? Infantry action. On the
remainder of the front there was no
action of importance."
Friday's Fierce Fighting.
The latest Paris report describing
Friday's fighting says:
"North of the Somme the enemy during
the night (Friday) delivered several
violent counter attacks against
x the positions taken by us yesterday

COMPENSATION BILL
PASSEDBYSENATE
Kern-McGillicuddy Measure Approved
in Practically Same
Form as House Enacted It.
MAKES FEDERAL PROVISION I
FOR CIVILIAN EMPLOYES
Compensation for Those Injured ]
While at Work and for Families
in Case of Death.
The Kern-McGilllcuddy bill providing
compensation for civilian employes of ^
the federal government who are in- j.
jured while at work, and adequate r
compensation for their families in case f
of death of the employes, was passed t
by the Senate late yesterday afternoon, ^
practically in the same form that it ^
came from the House. It is expected ^
that the House will accept the minor
amendments made in the Senate, that .
D
no conference between the two houses ^
i will be necessary, and that the bill
will go to the President for his signature
this week. e
The bill, in the case of permanent t
total disability of an employe, would c
grant a pension oi do-* per ten*, ui ins 1
salary during life. In the case of tern- A
porary totaL-disability the bill would t
grant 66% per cent of the employe's A
salary during the disability. In the a
case of permanent partial disability the f
bill would grant 66% per cent of the
loss in earning capacity to the employe. 1
In the case of temporary partial disa- o
bility the bill would grant to the em- I
ploye 66% per cent of loss in earning A
capacity. u
s
In Event of Employe's Death. t
In the event of the death of an em- t
ploye while on duty the bill grants v
from 20 to 66% per cent of the salary of ^
the employe, according to the number n
of dependents of the employe. This aid P
continues until the widow dies or re- *
marries and until the children are sixteen
years old.
Provision is made In the bill for
medical attendance of injured em- n
ployes. It is believed that such pro- t
vision will prevent protracted compensation
payments. Compensation is j:
to be paid to the employe injured after a
a period of waiting of three days. n
The bill provides for a commission e
to administer the employes' com- ?
pensation act, to be composed of three i;
commissioners at an annual salary of t
$4,000 each. It was proposed by some
senators that the act should be admin- v
istered by the Department of Labor, I
but friends of the measure pointed out v
it was best to make the administration d
of the compensation law independent d
of all government departments, in or- f
der to prevent interdepartmental *'
jealousies, which might arise from con- "
fcrring quasi-judicial powers onf one
department and requiring It to pass e
on the claims of others.
The bill was drafted by the American
Association for Labor Legislation, tj
of which Irving Fisher of Yale Uni- tl
verslty is president. President Wil- Q
son, Jane Addams and Justice Brandels K
are among the vice presidents of this
organization., t
The measufe, when it is enacted into
law, will supplant the present em- n
ployes' compensation law, which is de- 0
clared to be entirely Inadequate. h

ics with business, with preparedness
vith the maintenance of internationa

unctions of government.
"When you start out to be military

lughes told an audience in Oakland.
"I do not believe we can run this gov
rnment by mixing business and poll
ics," the nominee said to a gatherinj
>f business men here, a short time be
ore the Oakland meeting. At Oakland
Ir. Hughes repeated his declaratioi
hat he favored fostering honorabl<
imerican achievements in business an?
djusting difficulties by finding th<
acts and acting upon them.
"You can break down your prosper
ty by prostituting yourself in the fac<
t an unjust popular demand," Mr
lughes said. "I shall never do that
ind the unjust popular demand is onl:
injust because the facts are not under
tood. The only thing I am afraid of ii
his country is the dark. When we ge
hings out into the light of day and se<
he actual facts we generally find ou
rhere the truth and justice lie.
"Some people live in dreamland," Mr
lughes continued, in speaking of th<
eed for military and commercial pre
aredness. "They do not understan<
he actual world we live in."
Discusses "Federal Commissions."
The nominee spoke of federal com
lissions to investigate various situa
ions.
"We have developed commissions o:
nvestigation," he said. "What do thej
mount to unless we have expert com
nissioners? Commissions are nothinj
xcept as they are dominated by goo<!
ense, inspired by loyalty and patriot
sm and controlled by the facts am

ecure open and fair dealing, and a1
he same time make possible honesi

"Wt cannot go forward unless w<
salize ourselves nationally. We must
lore than ever understand that na
lonal powers are to be exercised am
fiat national prosperity can be gainec
nly by the potency of our national or
anization."
Mr. Hughes declared himself oppose<
> invisible government.
"I want," he said, "visible govern
lent, competent administration, no
nly by those elected by the people, bu
y appointees of elected officials, wh<
epresent the competence, the intelli
ence and the talent of the nation. W<
re entitled to that."
Speaks to Business Men.
In his address to business men of Sai
rancisco at the Commercial Club Mr
[ughes spoke, in part, as follows:
"We come to a constructive period, i
ifficult period, a period in whicl
.merica must look forward witl
reater confidence in the soundness o
ur life than she has hitherto had. W<
ave had an abundant surgery. No
ody can live by surgery alone, how
ver necessary it may be.
"We have got to have hygienic treatlent.

e built up by abundant exercise, bj
resh air and abundant nutrition. I an
lad to think that we are ready foi
hat forward movement, and now
hink we can be sure that we can conrol
monopolistic parties, and that wi
an prevent unjust discrimination. W<
an secure a square deal, and yet w<
an foster enterprise, build up and no
estroy, encourage and not fetter, an<
lake the honorable man of businesi
eel that he has a free avenue to ar
onest success.
"If we cannot so judge the Unitet
tates, then our future is a troubloui
ne, and we will fail as great nationi
f the past have failed. We are but
young people. We are only an exeriment.
Nations several times oui
ge have prospered, and left but scan
memorials. We have, as I say, a verj
ifficult system of government. It reuires
constant study and attention or
he part of those who know. The mar
krho knows is the man I want to tall
o about every department of life.
"I do not believe it is necessary t<
irostitute national business in order t<
ave the confidence of the electorate
think that is a great mistake. Wha
\re need in this country, as I have said
s, first, to have correct principles.
Vould Protect American Enterprise
"This is a non-partisan gathering;

nyself if I did rot say that as a prin

"Everywhere along the line from thii
ime on we have got to consider, no
that each one can do in a haphazar<

premature publication of Gen. Funston's
conclusions, but they indicated
last night that it would not cauae any
alteration in plans.
May Hamper Commissioners.
Officials realize, it is understood,
that the most pressing: matter for discussion
by the commission, from the
Mexican viewpoint, will be the question
of withdrawal of Gen. Pershinsr's
expeditionary force. In order to furnish
the American commissioners with
full information. Gen. Funston was
asked to express his views on the military
aspects of the expedition. There
is every indication that the commissioners
and later the administration
were expected to abide by the recommendations
of the chief military adviser
on border matters.
Publication of the fact that Gen.
Funston believes it wise to withdraw
the troops may hamper the American
commissioners, some officials think, in
obtaining whatever guarantees they
may ask of the Mexican government
as to security of the border from bandit
raids.
Share Gen. Funston's Views.
It is believed the administration was
fully prepared to arrange for the recall
of Gen. Pershing's force, singe
both State and War Department officials
are understood to share the
views expressed In Gen. Funston's report.
There can be little doubt, iC is now
said, that the withdrawal will ha
promptly agreed to when the commission
meets, the conferees then turning
their ntttnttovt to the 'drafting of a
protocol to coven future border operations,
investigation o/ the causes of
bandit raids and such other matters as
they may wish to take up.
Announcement Expected Soon.
No intimation came from the White
House yesterday as to when announcement
of the American membership of the
commission might be expected. In view
of Secretary Lansing's recent assurances
to Eliseo Arredondo. Mexican
i ambassador designate, that the commission
could be assembled very soon,
it was believed last night that the
names of the commissioners would be
made public early this week.
Secretary Lane, who will head the
delegation, already has accepted the
post, and as soon as his associates have
i been named and their views as to the
meeting place ascertained an agreement
on that point will be reached by
Secretary Lansing and Mr. Arredondo.
GIVES JOT IK MEXICO.
Alleged Suggestion of American
Withdrawal Arouses Enthusiasm.
EL PASO, Tex., August 19.?Mexican
reports in Juarez today indicated that
no steps have been taken by Gen.
Pershing's expedition looking toward',a
general withdrawal from Mexico. The
American expedition lies stretched out
in a compact line from Columbus, N. M.,
to El Valle, Chihuahua, a distance of
about 200 miles, the field headquarters
being maintained at Colona Dublan, 120
miles south of Columbus.
Reports that Gen. Funston had recommended
the withdrawal were received
with the greatest enthusiasm in Juarez.
Gen. Gabriel Gavira, inspector general
of the Carranza armies, and Gen. Francisco
Gonzales, commandant, said that
the reports, if true, "will tend to eliminate
the greatest cloud upon the Mexican
horizon."
MISS ALICE MASARYK

Daughter of American Woman and
Prague Professor Subject of
American Inquiry.
NEW YORK, August 19.?The release
from prison in Vienna of Miss Alice
Masaryk. charged with high treason,
was announced here tonight by Alexander
ypn Nuber, Austrian consul general.
Miss Masaryk, it was said, was freed
July 3.
Miss Masaryk is a daughter of Prof.
Thomas G. Masaryk of Prague, who
married a daughter of Rodolphe Garrigue,
a New York banker. Dr. Masaryk
is living in England, where he fled soon
after the outbreak of the war. His
daughter's arrest, it has been charged,
was due to the fact that on her father's
departure from Prague she took charge
of his library.
Dr. Masaryk is * stanch advocate of
Bohemian nationality. He attracted attention
by his attacks on the treatment
by Austria of the southern Slavs
and of the manner of the annexation
og Bosnia and Herzegovina.
State Department officials at Washington
informed those who asked some
time ago that an appeal be made to
the Austrian government in Miss
Masaryk's behalf that the United
States probably* would make an informal
inquiry through Ambassador

TRANSPORTATION CHIEFS '
FROM WEST ARE INVITED
Industrial Interests Asked to
Register Opinion for Arbitration
Principle.
MAYBE BREAK; NOT LASTING
Counter Proposals Not Considered
Probable?Seriousness of Situation
Is Not Lost
Sight Of.
The entire business strength
of the country is being canvassed
regarding President Wilson's
proposal to the thirty-three
railroad officials?equivalent to a
demand?for averting the threatened
nation-wide strike.
Before the arrival here of fourteen
presidents of western railroads
to whom the President late
yesterday afternoon telegraphed
an invitation to. come to Washington
to join in the conferences
it is expected that many powerful
protests will have been sent
to the White House.
Representatives of the railroad
managers' committee presented
a supplementary list of seventy
other railroad heads to the White
House last night, with the suggestion
that they also should be
invited here if the President
wishes to assemble all those in
authciTfJP'and responsibility.
"Back-Wre" Campaign.
This was believed in some quarters
to be a move on the part of the railroad
officials to grain more time in which to
organize their "back-flre" campaign
and to arouse public sentiment favorabl
to their cause.
No secret is made of the fact that
other large business interests are having
it brought to thair attention that
the abandonment of tte principle of arbitration
for settlemnit of all industrial
disputes, which the_rp.ilroads claim
the President asks them to do in the
present instance, is likely seriously to
affect them in the future. These interests
are expected to register their ob.
jections at the White House.
Ho Strike Anticipated.
Despite the apparent deadlock at the
White House conferences and the firm
attitude of the railroad officials in insisting
upon settlement of the entire ques
tion by arbitration, the conviction, even
I among the railroad presiednts, that there
wfll be no strike grew last night.
'A number of prominent railroad presidents
were quoted as saying that the
probability of a strike seemed to them
more remote than at any time since the
President volunteered his services as
mediator.
While there will be no definite action
taken in the controversy before tomorrow
or Tuesday, it was pointed out on reliable
authority that over the week end
the railroad officials will get into communication
with the controling financial
interests. It is possible that some powerful
directors of the railroads will be
brought to Washington.
Talk of arrangements for a strike continued
among managers and employes.
Each side thought that if such a break
came it would not last more than a week.
Counter Proposals Not Weighed.
Discussion of counter proposals and
compromises were current, but were
given little real attention by those who.
are in closest touch with all phases of
the situation. Possibility of the gov~
ernment operating the railroads iir
case of a strike were also discussed
as a remote contingency.
The seriousness of the situation was
never for a moment lost sight of in
either camp?t|iat of the railroad officials
or of the brotherhood leaders.
The unprecedentedness of the gathering
in Washington of the largest group
of railroad officials ever assembled in
this country, and the calling together
I of the committee of 640 brotherhood
| leaders from 225 railroad systems and
holding power of attorney for 400,000
employes portended that the issue was
' to be forced by the administration.
| Then came the President's dramatic
appeal to the thirty-three railroad
presidents yesterday, practically demanding
from them that they withdraw
their insistence upon arbitration
to meet a "condition" confronting 100.000,000
citizens of the United States.
For the first time the President's proposal
to both parties for settlement of
their controversy became authorltaImnmry
nrhftn an nfflplal Ktatp.
ment was issued by the White House,
written by the President in the first
person. Quickly following: this came a
strong statement from the railroad
officials Justifying their demands for
settlement of all points in controversy
by arbitration.
Both Camps Quiet.
Last night there was a brooding
quiet about the two headquarters. Both
sides were admittedly "pondering deeply
over the President's proposal." The
next move is supposed to be made by
the railroad presidents tomorrow.
They are expected to give an answer
to President Wilson at the White
House, although even then it is not
kaiuvp^ that it will be final.
Each part of the President's proposal
is expected to be taken up separately,
and the answers riven to the
White House separately. This fact and
the fact that the western executives
cannot reach Washington for several
days will contribute to the executive^
plan to consider the whole problem
is
