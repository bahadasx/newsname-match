The drive to win back Serbia

Already the weakened Teuton
lines with the Bulgarian allies
are feeling the strain of the at
tack from Fiorina to the Gulf of
Orfani, in which 'five towns have

Meanwhile from both eastern
and western fronts the progress
made is encouraging.
In a smashing offensive the Brit

cured the ridge that dominates
Thiepval and gained high ground

This advance ultimately will result
In the capture of the height of Mar

E BOYS
GIRLS JOB HERE
Male Sex Has Predominated in
. Recent Visits of the Stork
to Capital.
There has been an Increase In the
number of boy babies born In the Dis
trict recently, as compared with girls.
What's the answer?
Dr. John L. Norrls. assistant health
officer. Is frank In saying he doesn't
know. He points, however, to an Inter
esting theory. It Is that during a war
or a period of national depression
"hard Amies," most folks call lt-the
stork brlngB more boys than girls, be
cause the boys are needed more.
Dr. Norr.s savs that by statistics and
tables he has tried to prove this theory,
but not with much success. The fact
that eighteen vears from now there will
bo more ellglbles for ho DUtrict Na
tional Guard is not regarded by him as
a bad omen.
Why tho male sex Is given the worst of
it even in Infancy Is another question
the health officials find difficult to ex
plain If, as asserted by certain medical au
thoiitleg, more boy babies enter the
world In summer, whllo In the fall and
winter the girl birth rate predominates,
who'g to blame? Why should tho boys
be bothered with files and colic and all
the Infantile worries of hot weather?
Dr. Norrls sums up the situation by
saying. "It's a tough world for us men
any way yoif look at It."

PLAN

OPPOSED
H
Many Members of Board of
Education See No Need to
Postpone Opening.
CALL EXAMINATION ENOUGH
Say Thorough Inspection Would
Prevent Spread of Infantile
Paralysis.
That a postponement of the opening
of the District schools would be en
tirely unnecessary unless there Is fi.
great Increase In the number of esses
of Infantile paralysis In Washington
before the first of Hcptember, Is the
opinion of certain members of the
Hoard of Kducatlon.
Mrs. Husle Root Rhodes, when told
of a suggestion made to prohibit the
children who hud ben out of the city
previous to the opening of school
from entering at the beginning of the
term, said she considered such a plan
"foolish."
Disease Hits Everywhere.
"It has been shown," said Mrs.
Rhodes, "that It Is Impossible to tell
where one Is liable to be attacked by
this disease. Cases have occurred
where sanitation was perfect, as well
as where conditions were very poor.
The ban against children who have
been outside the city before the open
ing of school would, I thlnjt, be very
unnecessary,
"I think the wisest thing to do
would bo to examine thoroughly all
children at the opening of school and
keep them under the strict attention
of the health officials, who have been
very efficient In handling the present
situation.
Mrs. Margarita Spalding Oerry agreed
with Mrs. Rhodes. that It would be un
necessary to prohibit ll chllden ,who
havo been out oTlown ente'rlng school
at the beginning of the session.
Wo&ld Restrict Action.
"I think that such a plan would be
necessary only In such cases as will
show that the child has been In a dis
trict where the disease had reached the
stage of an epidemic," said Sirs. Oerry.
"Children from such districts should,
of course, bo segregated and watched
from ten days to two weeks. When It
Is shown that they are not affected by
the disease they should be allowed to
enter school."
Fountain Peyton, another member of
the board, stated that as far as he Is
concerned the matter lies entirely with
tho health officers.
Dr. J. W . Trask, assistant surgeon
general of the Public Health Service,
stated vesterday that It would be ad
visable. If the schools ormnfrt to hnv.

of those children returning to Wash-

Conference Went on Record.
The conference of Federal and State
authorities meeting here last week
went on record as favoring opening1
schools when an Infantile paralysis
epidemic was threatened only under
the most thorough medical supervi
sion, In Ualtlmore announcement was
made today that Health Commis
sioner Ulake has decided to postpone
the opening of the schools until Sep
tember If. Thev were to have been
opened September 13.
Philadelphia has taken similar ac
tion, besides prohibiting the attend
ance of children at Sunday schools,
motion picture shows, and other
places of public assemblage:
Wilmington, Del., has adopted the
policy of not allowing children who
have been out of the city to enter un
til two weeks after the schools open.

Eight-Hour Day Assured, Brotherhood Dele
gates Say Hint Heard President May
Run Roads With Receivers If
Strike Should Be Called
TRAINS TO RUN,
An air of confidence, such as
since the strike conferences began
ent today among the railroad employes gathered at the Nalional
Hotel.
"The eight-hour day is won. Stand firm." This was the gen
eral attitude. The men seem to believe that no matter what else
may happen, the eight-hour day Is assured.
Whether the eight-hour day will come after a strike or jvith
out a strike they do not know and apparently are not greatly con
cerned. That' there will be a strike seems also a question they are
unable to answer, but they are positive the eight-hour day is
assured even should the railroad managers and presidents break
off negotiations.
The belief seems to be gaining ground among the men, as a
result of the deep interest which President Wilson has taken in the
eight-hour day negotiations, that even if there should be a strike
the trains will not stop running.
SOME WAY .TO KEEP TRAINS GOING.
Some of fhe men are confident that
should the strike order be Issued Presi
dent Wilson will find' some way under
which he can force the railroads to con
tinue operating trains, or, falling
this, himself assume control of the
situation end operate the roads through
Federal receivers.
None of the lending brotherhood rep
resentatives would discuss this phase
of the matter, but it was the belief of
some of the men apparently that the
President has given a vast amount of
consideration to this side of the ques

Wilson's last call to the railroad presi

He was In a defiant mood and declared
he will tell the President frankly that
his plan for an adjustment of the ques

railroads to surrender.
"This Is a fight In which the entire

Mr. Ripley stated the railroads have
nothing to fear from a strike.

work by the engineers has relieved
the situation. No tontage was blown
over. The water Just ran In under or

OF
Offensive and Defensive Treaty
to Be Ppdposed by Mexican
DiploDfats.
LOAff IS PART OF PLAN
American Navy Would Guard
Neighbor, Who Would Pre
vent Invasion Via Border.
EL PASO, Aug. 20. It becamo
known here today from reliable
sources that when the Carranza
and American diplomats meet to
discuss the questions at issue be
tween the two countries, an of
fensive and defensive alliance be
tween the two nations will be pro
posed by the Mexican representa
tives. The Washington Times corre
spondent obtained this statement
from a man who has been identified
closely with the various revolu
tionary movements in Mexico since
they were started by Orozco and
Madero in 1010.
This man is known now to be
close to the Carranza faction and
to have been in conference here
recently with a young relative of
Venustiano Carranza, who came
hwrom Mexico City and re
turned after his, cftnfern'ce with
the man in question.
PLAN ACCEPTED.
This man placed the matter before tho
young Carranza representative as some
thing that should find favor with tho
United States, and he has been advised
since tho return of tho young man to
Mexico City, that it Is to be made one
of the foremost questions in the confer
ence. Carranza Is to offer. If the United
States will help him to restore peace
In Mexico by furnishing him money, to
guarantee to protect the United States
against Invasion along the Mexican
border by any foreign foo with which
the United States may go to war.
Tho United States Is to be asked to
agree to protect the Mexican coast from
invasion by an enemy In tho event that
Mexico should be attacked by a foreign
foe.
With such an agreemene, It Is stated,
Mexico could avoid the expense of build
ing a navy or even of rehabilitating the
excuse for a navy, which she possessed
before tho revolutions broke out.
Also Mexico's energies could be de
voted to strengthening Its army, while
the United States, with Its great naval
force, could give protection to the Mexi
can coast.
It Is agreed that such an agreement
would be excellent for the United States,
particularly in event or a war witn Ja
pan, providing Mexico can restore In
ternal peace and will maintain an army
compatible with her size as a nation.
Coull Repel Big Force.
Such an army, well drilled and of
ficered, It Is said, could, fighting upon
Its own territory with which it Is so
well acquainted, repel a tremendous Eu
ropean or Asiatic force.
The TlmeV Informant declares that
Mexico will be rehabilitated vand re
stored to proper place among the strong
nations of tho world In a very few
years if tho United States gives it the
proper backing In Its endeavors to re
store pence, and that such nn offensive
nnd defensive alliance between the
United States and Mexico, as will be
proposed, shall be of great benefit to
Americans us well ns Mexicans.
The attitude of the Mexicans, so long
one of suspicion nnd outspoken hatred
towards the Americans, Is becoming
more friendly since It has become ap
parent that the mobilization of the
militia on the border was not for the
purpose of Immediate Invasion.
The statements from Washington that
the American expedition under General
Pershing Is to bo withdrawn shortly,
has caused rejoicing among tho Mexi
cans, and further evidences of friend
ship arc being manifested.
From the same source, which fur
nishes the details of the offensive and
defensive plan, Tho Times' correspon
dent Is Informed that Mexico expects to
bo ablo to present evldenco to the
United States that American gold,
seeking Intervention of the United
States in Mexico, causeo the raid on
Columbus by Villa and the subsequent
raid on Glen Springs In tho Big Rend
region of Texas.
Accuses Corporation.
He says an American corporation
with heavy Interests In Mexico fur
nished tho money nnd that the agents
who passed It to the Mexicans who
brought about tho raids, wero close
friends of an American politician of
national prominence, who has had con
siderable to say about Mexico In the
last fow years.
Ho says for the Big Bend raid, S00
Vllllstas were brought Into El Paho In
small bunches nnd shipped north of here
to a mlno In Now Mexico ostensibly ns
minors; thnt they were later shlppuil In
small numbers to tho Dig Bend country,
