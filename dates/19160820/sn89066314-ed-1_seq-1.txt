WASHINGTON, Aug. 19. President
Wilson today in a formal statement of
his proposal for the settlement of the jj
difficulty between tne raiiroaus oi me
country and the railroad brotherhoods
indicated his intention to stand pat on
his insistence that the S-hour day be
granted the workers.
"This seems to me thoroughly prac
tical and entirely a fair program," he
said, "and I think the public has a
right to expect its acceptance."
President Is Prepared.
It is believed the President is pre
pared, now that the brotherhoods have
accepted his program, to thrust the
burden of the blame for a strike on
the railroad owners if a strike re
sults. "The 8-hour day has undoubtedly
the sanction of the judgment of so
ciety in its favor and should be adopt
ed as the basis for wages, even where V
the actual work to be done cannot be
completed within eight hours," the
President said.
At the same time the President pro
posed that the demand for extra pay
for overtime and all other issues be
postponed pending an invesitgation.
and suggested that if necessary he
would obtain authority from Congress
to appoint a body of impartial inves
tigators to probe the whole question.
This body, he said, would report to
Congress, though without making any
recommendations.
The President's statement was is
sued just before thirty-three railroad
presidents had assembled at the
White House to give their reply to the
proposition.
President Tlolden of the Burlington
told the President they continued to
stand for arbitration and did not be
lieve it right to ask them to abandon
their point.
Committee Has Full Power.
He made it plain, however, that the
full power of attorney to reject or
accept the President's plan lay finally
with the railway managers' commit
tee, who arc still in the city but who
have not participated in any of the
conferences with the President since
the railway executives arrived.
There is a strong indication today
rather than to reject the President's
plan and precipitate a strike they will
ask for more time and further con
ferences. The present indication that the In
terstate Commerce Commission might
be expected to give a very fair con
sideration to rate increases if the S
hour dav change is made is one of the
things the managers will try to clear

POLICE MUST QUIT"
Painter Says No Change Will
Be Made in His New-Appointments.
Hv United Pre.
BRUNSWICK. Mo., Aug. 19. "The
police commissioners, whose resigna
tions I have requested, are out and
they know it," said Lieutenant Gov
ernor Painter here today. He denied
he had asked that the commission of
Colonel C. C. Butler of St. Louis be
held up and announced Butler was
the new police., board commissioner
in the Mound City, succeeding Sam
uel McPhecters, who was ousted yesterday.
Painter said he had not received
word from McPheetcrs, saying he had
refused to resign. "I think McPheet
ers knows why he is going out and
there won't be any trouble over that,"
said Painter.
The lieutenannt governor said he
would instruct the chiefs of police at
St. Louis and St. Joseph not to rec
ognize the ousted commissioners if
they refused to get out. He said this
had been done with success in Kan
sas City when a commissioner who
was ousted had refused to send in his
resignation. Painter said if this should
fail in the case of McPheeters and
commissioners McDaniels and Cran
dall of St. Joseph he would take his
case to the attorney general for fur
ther action.
"I hae not heard from Governor
Maior on the removals and I don't
know why I should," Painter said in
conclusion.
Painter is here today with a com
mittee of senators, attending the fu
neral of Senator Wallace this afternoon.
Jefferson City on Tuesday will be a
Mecca for Missouri Democrats. On
that day leaders of the party from ev
ery part of the state will assemble

A number of Boone County Demo
crats, including D. W. Shackleford,

for representative to the Assembly

from the Eighth Congressional Dis

Mr. Boggs is president of the Young
Men's Democratic Club as "well and

meeting of that organization Tuesday
morning. The club is to map out the
plans for the coming campaign act
ing as a kind of bureau for the state
committee and expects to make a par
ticular business of looking after the
young voters, those who will come to
the polls for the first time this fall.
The organization of the club is simi

SPEEDWAY PARK. Maywood. 111.
Aug. 19. Daring drivers in speedy
mounts, having a qualification record
of better than 100 miles an hour in
trial spins, lined up at the tape on the
2-mile wood oval here this afternoon
and waited for the official signal to
dash away on the Speedway Grand
Prix Cup race of six laps, for $10,
000 in prizes.
The Grand Prix takes the place of
the Elgin road race which for many
ycars was one of the big sporting
events in automobile circles.
Copying after the running of horse
races, the event here today is divided
into six "heats." Five heats of
twenty miles each are to be run, the
winner of each heat qualifying as an
entrant in the final 50-mile prize
awarding event. It was a process of
elimination, those winning in the first
five heats being the entrants in the;
final spin.
Because of the way the race was to
be run, fans predicted that records for
the distances would be smashed. Keen
rivalry between drivers entered added
to the general interest of the big
crowd that assembled here early. The
race is being staged under the rules
of the American Automobile Association.
