Grand Assault Against Forces of
Central Powers Now in
Progress
SOMME TACTICS AGAIN

French Claim Capture of Small
Villages Berlin Reports
Taking Fiorina.
London, Aug. 19.—The long expect­
ed general offensive on the Saloniki
front haB opened and the grand as­
sault against the forces-of the Central
powers now is in progress in every
theater of the world war. General
Sarral is attacking the Bulgar-German
forces along the entire Greek-Serbian
frontier, a distance of more than one
hundred fifty miles.
Reports from both Berlin and Paris
indicate that the Entente allies are
following the same tactics in the
[Balkans that signalized the opening
of the great offensive on the Somme.
Small bodies of troops are attack­
ing at numerous points along the Bui
garian linos, apparently with the in­
tention of feeling out their opponents'
positions, before the real .battle opens.
The French claim the capture of a
number of villages in the initial phas
es of the offensive, while Berlin re
ports the capture of (Fiorina, a Greek
town .fifteen miles southeast of Mon­
astic from the Serbians. Serbian
headquarters admit this1 repulse.
On the eastern front the Russians
have forced their way into the heart
of the great mountain barrier between

Austrians-admit (^retirement w6sit:6fc
Javlonitza, the gateway to one. of the
most, important passes through thp

the Austrians are retreating toward
the Choraah. ridge, the highest point
in the Carpathians in that region.
From, this ridge the ground falls rap
idly'j"jto ijie plains of Hungary.
Farther to the.south, in the Buko
wina end of, the battle line, the Rus­
sians have been forced back in their
advance on Kirilbaba, the next pass
south of Jablonitza and about 60
miles from that point.

E. A. Greenwood, state dairy com­

STUNS RUNAWAY HORSE
SAVES BOY RIDER'S LIFE
By.sturining a runaway horse with
his Shovel, Joe 'Fix, working in the
street at Mandan, yesterday saved the
life of the young son of Charles Koch.
The boy was riding one of his fath­
er's race horses, when he lost control
of his monnt. The animal swung at
Main street and Third avenue, throw­
ing young Koch from the saddle. One
foot caught in the stirrup his head
bumping the pavement, he was drag­
ged at a mad pace until Fix, digging
at a water connection, struck the ani­

Several men rushed to the scene and

BOYS TEACH
"Shine at a Nickel" Includes
Ten New Mexican
'Words.
WITH BISMARCKERS
Mercedes, Tex.. August 19.—Cact­
us may become as familiar as cab­
bage to the Bismarck soldiers, palms
may create no more interest than
hickory trees, but the principal pro­
duct of the border—Mexicans—seems
just as fascinating to the North Da
kotans today as the day of their ar­
rival at Mercedes.
The Mexican children are a source
of never-failing amusement. They
swarm everywhere. Some of their
elders, especially the old men and
women, do not cross the railroad
track into the American part of town
once a week. 'But the youngsters
dart across the "international line"
at break of day and spend most of
the day with the Americans.
Morning mess is hard'y over when
swarms of little bipwn boottflacks
invade the North Dakota regiment,
eager to polish boots and putees.
A five-cent shine is a bargain be­
cause it includes a lesson in Spanish.
Several of the Bismarck open make it
a point fco learn at least ten new Mex­
ican word A' with every shine. Before
their boots wear out they expect to
be masters of the language.
Critical students say the Spanish
spoken at Mercedes is far more pure.
But little is pure in this day of adult­
eration, and one may as well take his
Spanish, like his granulated sugar, as
it comes and digest it as best he can.
These bootblacks are born gamb­
lers, apparently. I saw an officer
give one of them a dime yesterday.
First the youngster split it with an
older boy who, it seems, owned the
shine box with which he did business.
Then the bootblack made a bee-line
to the only gambling hall in Mer­
cedes—a soda fountain containing a
nickle-in-the-slot machine which at
times yields twenty,sixteen, eight,
four and two trade checks and at oth­
ers nothing. The youngster shriek­
ed news of what he intended to do
as he dashed through the street and
a score of boys followed the plunger.
He dropped the nickle in the slot and
shot the lever and the circle of on­
lookers, chattering like monkeys, be­
came silent while fate decided wheth­
er the gamester should win. Twenty
checks gurgled out of the brass throat
of the machine and a roar like a
budding revolution went up. Swift
runners darted out and across the
railroad track to spread the good
news of the gambler's "killing"
through the Mexican quarter and
summon his relatives to the hall of
good fortune.
With his hat cocked on one side
of his head and his eyes dancing, the
boy fed all the checks in to the craw
of the machine, shrugged his should­
ers, and swaggered smiling out on the
side-walk to hunt another shine
customer.

San Francisco, Aug. 19.—Charles E.

He told the audience that he favored

"You can break down your poster­

From klexico,
REPORT WILL BE GIVEN
TO JOIltfT COMMISSION
Believed Board Will Promptly
Agree to Withdrawal Propo­
sition When They Meet.
(Washington, Au'£T~19—A recom­
mendation from General Funston that
the American troop.il be withdrawn
from Mexico was contained in a re­
cent reptyt on the military situation,
made at the request TJf the war de­
partment and designed for use of the
joint commission which will discuss
border problems. State department
officials do not attempt to disguise
their regret over premature publica­
tion of General Funston's conclusion,
but they indicated today that it would
not cause any alteration .in plans.
Publication of the fact that General
Funston believes it wise to withdraw
the troops may hamper the American
commisisoners, some officials think.
It is believed the administration
was fully prepared to arrange for the
recall of General Pershi^^s force,
since both state and Wat {department
officials are said to share the viewB
expressed in General funston's re­
port.
There can be little doubt, it is now
said, that the: ^itiidrawal will be

ations, investigation of the' causes of

iNo intimation came from the White
House today as to when announce­
ment of the American membership of
the commission might .be expected.
Clotlgh Job
May Go to
Hannaford
St. Paul, Aug. 19.—It is believed in
railroad circles here that J. M. Hjinna
ford, president, may succeed Colonel
William P. Clough, who died in New
York Thursday, as chairman of the
board of directors of the Northern
Pacific railroad.
In this event, it is also believed
George T. Slade, now first vice-presi­
dent, .will succeed to the presidency.
Headquarters of Mr. Hannaford,
should he become chairman of the
directorate,, ^ill be established in St.
Paul.
Some gossip has it that the office
held by Colonel Clough might be abol­
ished. This is based on the under­
standing that since the road's finances
were favorably adjusted by the fam­
ous $600,000,000 blanket mortgage by
Mr. Hill three years ago, the neces­
sity of a chairman to represent the
road's interests in 'New Yorlf have
been done away with to an appreci­
able extent.
AT
Willis ton, N. D„ Aug. 17.— Going to
aid of his brother, two years younger
11-year-old Donald Currie was drown­
ed in a back water from the Missouri
river here today.
With other small boys the Currie
boys went down to the backwater a
mile from town to swim. The young
erboy called for help when some dis­
tance from shore and Donald at once
plunged in to go to his aid.
When the younger lad seized Don­
ald with a drowning grip, ooth boys
sank. The younger lad was saved by
companions, but Donald's body was
found only after an hour's search.
Long work by physicians failed to re­
vive the bdy. The Currie boys are
sons of C. F. Currie, a well known
commercial traveler.

County Commissioners Move to
Sink More Money in Graders
and Engines.
LESS WORK THIS YEAR
WITH MORE EQUIPMENT
If Machinery Is Purchased, No
Appropriation Will Be Left
to Work With.
Despite the fact that le^ss work is
'being done this year on the roads of
the county with more equipment, the
board of county commissioners has
advertised for bids on more machin­
ery.
If all of the proposed equipment is
purchased it will entail an expense of
,110,000, leaving little in the good

"i'llit' \WH2h*'W utilize life
present machinery, valued at $17,SIX),
or the new machinery.
Bids Advertised For.
The 'board has advertised for bids
on an elevator road grader, one or
more engines and a road leveler. The
grader will cost $1,200 and up, the
engines $3,000 each and the leveler
about $1,100. If the two engines as
proposed are purchased the cost will
therefore 'be from $8,000 to $10,000.
Already contract work amounting
to some $25,000 has been let. After
this id paid and the machinery paid
for it will not leave enough in the
good roads fund to operate the equip­
ment on.
Less Work This Year.
A new engine and two graders were
purchased this spring for $4,500, 'but
with the extra equipment less work
has ibeen done. Last year 250 miles
of road was improved this year to
date only 50 miles has been.
Good roads boosters are unanimous
in declaring that before more equip­
ment is purchased a system should
be evolved whereby the present ma­
chinery can ibe used effectively. All
of the engines and graders are now
bunched when one is stopped 'by a
stone they are all tied up.
It is costing the county now about
$1,400 a month to run the outfit, $1,250
for laibor and the rest for oil and re­
pairs.

Dr. Foster appeared to be in a stato
of great excitement, and told Dr. Tis­

Believes Eight Hour System O. K.
While President Wilson was ad*
dressing the railroad executives, tell*
ing them they face a "condition, not
a principle," his statement to the
country reviewing his plan afd cha»
acterizing it as a "thoroughly practi*
cal and fair program," was given out
at the White House. In the state*
ment, he urged the adoption of the
efght-hour day because he believes
the concession right, suggested the
creation by congress of a small body
of men to investigate the results and
urged the abandonment of the de*
mands for time and a half overtime

argued that the eight-hour day is im­
practicable in railroading said

Agreement Expected.
The railroad officials found two
points in President Wilson's pnbUo
statements of his settlement plan
that confronted them and lead to a
belief that eventually there will be
an agreement averting a strike. The
first was a hint that, if the facts war*
ranted, the Interstate Commerce com*
mission might grant an increase in
freight rates, and the second was a
suggestion that the eight-how has*
would be acceptable only tentatively
and might be terminated after Invest!?

under the president's plan.
It was after a prolonged meeting at
their hotel that the raUroad prsai*
