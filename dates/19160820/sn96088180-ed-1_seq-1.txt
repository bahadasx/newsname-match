'London, Aug, 19, -British troop

of the Somme last night In one ot
the greatest gain made by the allies
Ince the opening- mah or the allied
offensive.
The Germans were thrown back on
practically every lector of a sli-mlle
front, extending from a point south or
Thlepval to the point where the Brit

near Gulletnont.
The greatest British gain was scor
ed from Foureaux wood eastward to
the Junction with the French. Gen

that the British advent d cn tw

German trenches to a depth of from
300 to 600 yards. '

gained, aUttle ground.
, Ixmclon. Aug. 19. Brltlsli troops
have struck a great blow against the
German lines north or the Somme,
rapturing the outskirts or the village
cf Gulllemont and making gains' on
. prnrtk'ally the wole Somme front.
General Halg reported this afternoon.
' Between Ovlllers and Thlepval. the
British pushed forward over half a
mile, taking hundreds of prisoners,
llalg asserted.
The British advance wns made at
various points along a six-mile Jront,
extending from a point northwest of
Ovlllers to the regon or Gulliomont.
The most decisive gains were scored
between Ovlllers and Thlepval, where
the forward rush of the British thrust
deeply Into the German lines around
the salient at Thlepval.
East sntl southeast of Mouquet
tarm (southeast of Thlepval) the
"British advanced 300 yards. Farther
east soveral hundred yard of enemy
trenches were captured between "the
Foreaux wood and the 'Bapaume-Al-bert
highway, an advance that
brought the British lines closer to
the fortified village of Martlnpulch,
.of the local Gorman strongholds.
Still further east, the British drove
the Germans rrom the western out
skirts of Gulllemont and pressing on
northwest of the town, captured hos
tile positions between Delevllle wood
and Glnrhy, capturing German posi
tions In the ordchards north of Long
neval. London, Aug. 19. Giant 18-Inch
guns, outranging the famous German
43 centimeters, are playing a most
Important roliV In the allied advance
on both bank ot the Somme.
Despatches from the French front
today revealed for the first tlmo the

Washington, Aug, 19. Secretary
ot War Baker today refused point
blank to discuss the report that Gen
eral Funston has recommended the
withdrawal of General Pershing's
army from Mexico.
"The department's policy' Is not to
d lectins rumors," Baker said. "The
department will only discuss It own
actions."
Army officials were equally reti
cent regarding the report from 8an
Antonio. A national railroad strike
would put Pershing's column In a
dangeroua position as regards main
tenance, some officers aald.
Tile troopers would be In po
tentially hostile country with supplies
sufficient to last only a month at the
most and no certainty ot replenishing.
The militia organisations on this
side of the border would offer a big
problem of the aame sort, since they
are consuming vast quantities of sup
plies daily ten carloads of food be
ing shipped Into El Paso alone every
day.
Washington, Aug. 19. The sen
ate today passed the worklngman's
compensation bill without a roll call,
following futile effort by Senator
Cummins, Iowa, to amend it so a
to give the secretary of labor and
not the commission provided for in
the measure, jurisdiction provided by
the bill. -
VIOLENT GERMAN
ATTACK IS HELD
Paris, Aug. 19. The Germans en
tered a small element of a French
trnech north of Maurepas in most vio
lent counter-attacks against all the
newly-won French positions north of
the Somme last night, but at every
point where halted, It was offlolslly
announced today.
German assaults north of the Som
me reached their greatest violence
between Maurepas and Clery. The
Teutons vainly attempted to expel the
French from the outskirts ot Maure
pas and throw back the French lines
threatened to encircle the village. ,
The German resumed the fighting
on the northwestern front of Verdun
last night with two grenade attacks
against the French salient north of
Avocdurt and against Hill S04. Both
attacks wore checked. Tho Germans
were driven back to their trenches.

whole Verdun front.
In Thursday's and Frlday'a fight

"Such a plan mean receivership
for the roads," Hill continued!
"In addition. 'it would cripple our
train service. In the south 28 rail

day principle and every one of them,
without exception, are in the hand
of receivers. We wont be. We would
not get any increased rates to bal

that So we simply will not accept
the principle."
"Our government operates a rail
road In Panama," continued Hill. "It
gets four times the freight rates we
get here. Yet that road has no wint

climb and no mountains to tunnel.
Hill, said he was talking directly
only for the Great Northern.
"I can say unequivocally that the
Great Northern never will accept the
eight hour principle," concluded Hill.

FOR Eilfl
TliEII'S DAY
Washington, Aug. 19. President
Wilson today in a formal statement
of hi propoaal for settlement ot the
difficulty between the railroad ot the
country and the railway brotherhoods.
Indicated bis intention to stand pat
on hi insistence that the elgki-hour
day be granted the worker. -.. ,
"This aeems to me a thoroughly
practical and entirely fair program,"
he said, "and I think the public ha
a right to expect its acceptance."
It is believed the president ls pre
pared, now that the 1 brotherhood
have accepted hi program, to throw
the burden of blame for a strike cr
on the railroad owner, if a strike re
sult. "The eight-hour day now undoubt
edly has the sanction of the judg
ment ot society in its favor and
should be adopted as a basis for
wages even where the actual work
to be done cannot be completed with
in eight hours," the president said.
At the same time President Wilson
propoeed that the demand for extra
pay for overtime and all other Issues
be postponed, pending an Investiga
tion and suggested that, It necessary,
he would obtain authority from cong
ress to appoint a body of Impartial
investigators to probe the whole situa
tion.
This body, he said, would report
to congress though without making
any recommendation.' . ' , ;
.The statement was issued just alter
33 railway presidents had assembled
at the White House to give their re
ply to the proposition. ? ."'
President Holden of -"the Burling
ton road, told the president that they
continued to stand for arbitration,.
and did not believe it right to ask
them to abandon that principle. He
made it plain, however, that the full
power of attorney to reject or ac
cept the president's plan lay finally
with the railway managers' commit
tee, who are still in the city, but
who have not participated In any ot
the conferences with President Wil
son since the railway president ar
rived.' '... V ....
It Is expected that before the final
crisis has been reached, the railroad
managers will be asked to the White
House to indicate -whether they will
accept or rejuect the president's plan.
There ls strong indication today
that rather than reject It and precip
itate a strike, they will ask for more
time and further conferences.
President Wilson's Intimation that
the Interstate commerce commission
might be expected to give a very fair
consideration to rate Increases If the
eight-hour day Is granted, Is one ot
the things the, managers will try to
clear up. s 1 .
President Wilson offered what be
believed was a practical means of
meeting, the situation and urged the
executives to put It Into effect.
