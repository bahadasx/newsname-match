The Mississippi Industrial Institute

annual aewdon Tuesday, Sep
tember and President V hit f u-l.i.
who ha recently returned ffdm
A-Jieville, N. C where he spent a
portion of the lummtr, announce
that prospect for the coming yi'ur
are exceedingly bright.
An unusually larne number of re
quests for rest-nations in the dor
mitories hove been received, and it
is believed that the school will start
out with a full complement of stu
dents. The first three day of the
session will be devoted to examina
tions, and recitation will begin on
Friday, September 22.
The opening of the new session
will witness several changes in the
faculty. Miss Bessie Huddleston, who
has been an instructress in the Eng
lish department, has tendered her
resignation, and will be succeeded by
Miss Mary Calloway, of Pontotoc,
Miss. Miss Calloway is an alumna
of the local institution, and has just
completed a post graduate course
extending over a period of three
years at the Leland Stanford Uni
versity in California, where fhe took
her M. A. degree. Miss Bessio Heath,
who has been taking 3 post-graduate
course at Columbia, returns to- th
college and resumes her place at the
head of the department of history.
During the absence of Miss ' Hett'ih
her trades n&f e been most accepta
bly performed by Miss Lottie How
ard, who will probably remain as an
assistant instructress in history.
On account of the economic poli
cy pursued by the Mississippi Legis
lature at its last session only about
$2,500 was appropriated for im
provements at the college, but this
small amount has been judiciously
expended, and both grounds and
buildings have been put in good
shape.

the livpxtmk exhibition which l to

afternoon.
The president now hail under con
sideration an invitation to visit JaeksJ
son early in the fall, and as date
for the livestock exhibition have not
been definitely agreed upon it will
be an easy mutter to fix the time so
as to make it possible for him to
come direct from the state capital to
Columbus.
Ex-President Taft visited Colum
bus when he was making his famous
"swing around the circle" in 1909,
havirg come here from Jackson and
gone next to Birmingham, and as
1 resident Wilson, in the event that
he decides to come south, will visit
both these cities it will not be in
convenient for him to include this
city in his itinerary. More than ten
thousand strangers were here to
greet former President Juft when he
visited Columbus seven years ago,
and in the event that President Wil
son accepts the invitation which has
been extended him it is expected that
he will be greeted by a Btill larger
crowd. ; .
Although there will be Sunday
school at both the First Methodist
and Episcopal churches this morning
at 9:30 o'clock, there will be no
preaching at either place today.
Cotton Detpita Weevil.
Agricultural College, Miss., Aug.
19. Prof. J. W. Fox, former direc
tor of the Mississippi experiment sta
tions, now manager of the Delta
Planting Company plantations at
Scott, Miss., delivered a worth while
address here last night to the farm
ers of Union county, who arrived
yesterday in automobiles for a two-
day short course in agriculture.
'Growing Coton Under Boll Weevil
Conditions," was the subject of the
lecture, and Prof. Fox's remarks
were based on his experiences with
the weevil.
He stated that in addition to a
good soil, well drained, early and
thorough preparation of the seed
bed and early planting of plenty of
seed were essentials to success. He
pointed out that if the first crop
failed it was too late to re-plant cot
ton, but some other crop should be
substituted. He advocated a thick
stand, as much as 10,000 stalks to
the acre, rapid cultivation and keep
ing the grass down as the surest
method of getting a fair crop "set be
fore the weevils appeared. Compara
tively early and vigorous varieties
were recommended. Trof Fox stated
that cold winters were the best pro
tection and gave scientific demon
strations, showing the infestations
to be light following hard winters.
He stated that he had not found
it profitable to pick up the squares,
owing to a heavy demand for labor
on other farm operations at that
season of the year.
Illiteracy BuIUtin of Interest.
The Mississippi Illiteracy Commis
sion has recently issued a bulletin
which gives some interesting facts
regarding illiteracy in this state. The
bulletin shows that the nuinbc: of
native white illiterates in Mississippi
is 5.2 per cent, while the avcrrg-? for
the United States is only 3 per cent.
It further shows that of the total
population ten years old or older,
Mississippi has 234 illiterates per
1,000, being the fourth state in the
Union in this respect In this class
the number of illiterates in the Unit
ed States is 7.7. per cent of the en
tire population, while in Mississippi
it is 24.4 per cent
Miss Elise Timberlake, a member
of the faculty of the Industrial In
stitute and College in this city, is
secretary of the Mississippi Illiteracy
Commission, Hon. Charles Rundle, of
1 Louisville, is chairman, and other
members are State Superintendent
of Education W H. bmitn, of Jack

week at the age of 93 years.
Bakers throughout the country
are preparing to advance the price of
the 5-cent loaf of bread to 6 cents,
according to Paul Schultze, head of
one of Chicago's largest baking con
cerns. The advance may come within
two weeks, he said. "If flour prices
remain at their present high figure
it will be impossible for bakers to sell
the small-sized loaf for five cents,"
said he.
A conspiracy to manufacture and
circulate $1,000,000 of counterfeit
silver certificates and United States

FUSSES THE SENATE
BITTER FIGHT OVFR MEASURE
AT LAST RESULTS IN FAV.
ORABLE VOTE.
Washington, Aug. 11). The gov
ernment shipping bill passed the
Senate Friday by a vote of 'AH to 21,
ending one of th most bitterly con-
tested legislative struggles
of the
Wilson administration.
In the last Congress the measure
precipitated a Democratic revolt,
but revised so as to minimize the
government operation feature, the
measure received unanimous Demo
cratic support and solid Republican
opposition. It already has pushed the
House.
The shipping bill provides for the
creation of a government shipping
board to acquire and operate ships
for rehabilitation of the American
merchant marine ami appropriates
$50,000,00(5 for that purpose, to be
raised by the sale of Panama Canal
bonds.
Several important amendments
w'ere agreed to just before the final
vote, among them one by Senator
Hoke Smith, reducing the salary of
! the hhipping board members from
,$10,000 to $7,51(0 per eur.
Other amendments adopted includ
ed one by Senator Fletcher, whii'h
would authorize the President to
seek adjustment of foreign discrim
inations against American (shipping
! through diplomatic negotiations and
to take retalitory action if such ne
gotiations fail.
Another by Senntor Thomas would
authorize the treasury to withhold
clearance from masters of vessels
who deliberately refuse to accept
1 fr,.iKht from American shippers
without satisfactory reasons.
At the last minute vain efforts
were rn&de by Senator Borah to at-
tach the immigration bill to the
shippng measure.
Administration leaders are hope-
fui that Senate amendments to the
, wjn be acceptable to the' IIouho,
where it will be submitted Tuesday
an,j tnat a conference will be un-
necessary.
The bill as passed by the Senate
WOu!d create a shipping board of five

reai hd no definite decision.
With th situation thu apparently
leadl'M kel the only hope lay in re
port that the railroad official might
itfk'et a rounfer proposal or that
one side or the oiher miuht recede.
Thirty-one president and ranking
official of th grat railroads re
ceived from the President this after
noon his plan for the adoption of an
eight hour day, regular pro rata pay
for overtime ami a creation of a Fed
eral commission to investigate collat-
eral issues. They told him they would
like to consider the question and
would report bark tomorrow with
the committee of managers which has
been conducting negotiations.
At the same time the general com
mittee of 640 representatives of
the employes were approving the
President's plnn by a large majority
and soon after the railroad officials
left the White House the four heads
of the railroad brotherhoods notified
the President of the vote. The em
obtjcs'rommitU'e remained hero At.,
the lresident's call.
The railroad officials revealed
clearly their opposition to Mr. Wil
son's plans and indicated that they
would press further their offer to
arbitrate. It was reported, however,
the officials might suggest a counter
proposal based on the acceptance of
the eight-hour day and arbitration of
all points instead of the investiga
tion by a Federal commission, pro
posed under the President's plan. It
was stated positively that the officials
had reached no definite decision.
In case the president finds no
hope of settlement at the next meet
ing he will probably summon to
Washington some of the powerful
financiers of the country serving as
directors of the railroads. Adminis
tration officials assert that the Pres
ident is determined to effect a set
tlement before the representatives
of both sides, now here, leave Wash
ington.
In their formal statement the rail
road official insisted upon arbitra
tion on the ground that if they gave
in this time it would mean the aban
donment of the principle of arbitra
tion and because they feared that if
they granted the eight-hour day with
its consequent added expense with
out resort to arbitration it would
prejudice any appeal they might
make later to the Interstate Com
merce Commission.
On tlje surface the threatened
strike appears nearer than at any
time since the negotiations at the
White House began, but administra
tion officials continued to believe
that eventually there would be aa
agreement.
