DENIES INJUNC

HOLDS THAT DEniAiiS C" SCTE
TIVE AGENCY IS A PROPER
CHARGE AGAISN COUNTY
COUNTY REPRESENTED BY COUN
TY ATTORNEY ROSS AND
JUDGE CAMPBELL
In the matter of the application Tor
an Injunction against the board of
supervisors and the" county treasurer
filed b) J. B. Speer. A. S. Field, and
J. B. Murcheson. to prevent the pa)
ment of the claim filed by the Thlel
Detective Agenc) for services in col
lecting evidence in the liquor selling
cases, the court this morning denied
the application ad gate judgment to
the defendants. The case was argued
by County Attorne John F. Ross and
Judge Campbell for the county offi
cials and Alexander appeared for the
plaintiffs in the absence of Attornej
Irwin of Douglas. The case for the
count was well presented and they
cited a number of authorities which
bore out their contention that the
claim was a legal charge. Attorney
Alexander Murry did the best he could
of a bad mess but the weight of au
tborlt) was against him.
In deciding the case the court said.
"We are taught b history that organ
ized soclet) was Instituted in the first
place for the purpose of enforcing the
socalled penal laws of such society.
That has. from the beginning of his
tory, been the particular duty of so
ciety and its government. From time
to time these duties have been ex
tended, but I think it has always re
mained as the chief duty of the offi
cers of society to enforce the penal
laws of such society.
"Now, under our law, the counties
of the different states are given, by
the sovereignty, tthe right and authori
ty and the duty to enforce the penal
laws through their various officers.
The County Attorney's Office, the
Sheriff's Office and the Court being
the chief offices, but every officer
having a part In the enforcement of
the peal statutes.
"The legislature, in providing for
tbe expenses of the county govern
ment, has named specific expenses,
and then has, in the end, provided for
the contingent expenses necessarily
Incurred for the use and benefit of
the county. Without, passing on the
provisions of Section 2 of Paragraph
2381, without considering It necessary
to pas on it, as to whether, techni
cally, the county attorney should wait
until a crime has been committed a
man has been murdered, we will say
before he take any steps to appre
hend, the offender, I am satisfied there
can be no higher duty for the county
and its officers than to enforce Its
criminal laws. If the county officers
lave reason to believe that the crim
inal laws have been violated, or are
going to be violated. I think It Is
their duty even more to prevent future
violations than to punish past viola
tors. If they have reasonable grounds
to beHere that the laws are going to
be violated, and I think that Section
11. to regard to contingent expenses
seceasarily incurred for the use and
benefit of the county Is broad enough
to cover y reasonable expenses for
lbe enforcement of the criminal law,

ARIZONA MAN KILLS LARGE

Is little doubt of Its living.
bether the expenses are reasonable
not. Common experience teaches
a, and the experience of the past
w months has taught us, that there
.3 absolutely no way to enforce this
particular-law, which Is not only one
f our criminal laws, but one which
nag written by the people Into our
'undamental law, than through the
services of hired detectives. We have
bad two or three experiences during
hese cases where citizens have been
-ailed as witnesses, and have come
n the stand and perjured themselves,
3 the knowledge of the Court and
very man sitting on the jury, in order
to avoid testifying. I remember one
ase two weeks ago when one young
'nan that I know very well was on the
itand and any one who saw him could
11 that he was perjuring himself to
tvold testifying and adopted the old
amlliar attitude of saying "I don't
inow," in regard to matters that any
human being was bound to know, and
"or that reason it Is very apparent to
his court that if the law Is to be
enforced, this Is a reasonable ex
ense in enforcing It. The very first
duty of every public officer, from the
;orernor of the state down to the
onstable in the smallest precinct. Is
to enforce our criminal law, and I
hall hold that this is a proper charge
i;alnst the county and any amend-
lent setting forth the actual facts
charged would not avail the plaintiffs
n the case."
