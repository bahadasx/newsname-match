LONG EXPECTED OFFENSIVE OH
SALONIKI FRONT OPENS AND
. COMPLETES CHI OF FIGHTING
(Republican A. P. Leased Wire ;
The long expected general offensive
or the Snloniki front has opened and I
the grand assault against the forces
ol toe central powers now in proq
rers in every theater of the world
war. General Sarrail is attacking
the Bulqarian-German forces alonn the
entire Greek-Serbian frontier, a dis
tance of more than 150 miles.
Reports from both Berlin and Paris
indicate that the entente allies are
following the same tactics in the
Balkans that signalized the openinq
ef the nreat offensive on the Somme.
Small bodies of troops are attack
ing at numerous points alonq the
Bulgarian line, apparently with the
intention of teshnq out their oppon
ents positions before the real battle
opens. The French claim the cap
ture of a number of viliaqes in the
initial phases of the offensive, while
Berlin reports the capture of Fiorina,
a Greek town, 15 miles southeast of
Monastir. from the Serbians. Serb
ian headquarters admits this repulso.
On the eastern front the Russians
have forced their way into the heart
f tne qreat mountain barrier be
tween Galicia and the Hungarian
plains. Tlie Austrians admit a re
tirement west of Jablonitza, the gate
way to one of the most important
passes throuqh the mountains, which
was seized by the Russians this week.
In this district the Austrians are re -treatinq
toward the Chornahora ridqe,
the hiqhcst point in the Carpathians
in that region. From this ridge the
ground falls rapidly to the plains of
Hunqary.
Farther to the south on the Buko
wina end of the battle line the Rus
sians have been forced back in their
advance on Kirlibaba, the next pass
outh of Jablonitza and about 50 miles
from that point. i

The pressure of the Anglo-French
forces has been exerted strongly re
cently where the two forces ioin
hands between Guillemont and Maur
eoas. Jiucordiro to latest British ad
vices was from Foureaux or Hiah
wood to the ounction poit. In addi
tion the British report that they have
named a fortinq in the village of
Guillemont. Berlin says that Anqlo
French attacks north of the Somme
were repulsed, except around Guille
nont, where the German line was
shortened.
While not as active as the Brit
ish on the Somme front, the French
have made more qains in the Ver
dun region. Fighting took place on
both banks of the Meue. the Ger
mans attacking on the left and the
French on the right bank. The Ger
man advance was frustrated, Paris
says, and the French succeeded in
qaining entire possession of the vi I -lqe
of Fleur. Counter attacks by
the Gerrrars failed to dislodqe the
French, Paris asserts.
Austrian aeroplanes have made an
other raid on Venice in retaliation
for the raid anainrt Triest by the
Italians. The Germans have made
another air raid aqainst Russian
military er tablishments on Oesel Is
land, off te Gulf of Riqa: Austrian
airmen have bombed Italian works

has raided German ammunition

WASHINGTON. Aug. 19. China
haa profrsted to Japan, it wan learned
here today, against the sending of
I.iW" troops to Cheng Chiatung- in
sastern Mongolia, because, of recent
disturbances there resulting in u
clash between Chinese and Japanese
troopr.
It is contended by the Peking gov
ernment that when the IochI Chinese
m-igistrate ordered precautions taken
against an expected raid by nomadic
bandits, who were seizing prominent
persons in that section for ransom of
, the Japanese residents refused to
olicy. The magistrate attempted to
enforce the order by arresting a ,Iap
nnene it is said, whereupon the Jap
anese began armed resiatance, which
resulted In about seventeen deaths on
hotfi sides. The Japanese captured
th magistrate and took him away.
The Japanese are said to have re
ceived reinforcements from their near
bv garrisons In south Manchuria and
reports from Tokio sav a regiment of
cavalry, three bnttalioim of infantry
and a mixed company with machine

WASHI-NOTON, Au. t. A recom
mendation from (ieneral Kunston that
the American troops be withdrawn
from Mexico was contained in a rece.'i'
report on the military situation m;.;
at the reiucst of the war deiartmeNt
and designed for use of the Joint com
mission which will discuss liorder
problems. Stale department officials
do not attempt to disguise their regret
iver premature publication of flen
eral l-'unslon's conclusions, hut they
Indicated today that it would not cause
any alteration in the plans.
Officials realize .It is understood,
that the Mexican viewpoint will be
the iiuestion of withdrawal of (Ieneral
l'eishinii's expeditionary fore-. In
order to furnish the American com
missioners wil full Information, t'.en
eral I'unston was asked to express his
view on the military aspects of the
exediiion. There is every Indication
that the commissioners, anil later the
administration, were expected to abide
by the recomniend.it toils of the chief
military advisers on border matters.
Publication of the fact that O-iieral
Kunston believes it wise to withdraw
the troops may hamper thp American
commissioners, some officials think, in
obtaining whatever guarantee tliey
may ask of the Mexican government
as to security of the border from ban
dit raids. It is believed the adminis
tration is fully pieired to urrmige for
the recall of Oeneral I'ersbing's forces
since both slate and war dfpartn!nt
officials are understood to share the
views expressed in (Ieneral r'unslon's
rejsirt.
There can be little doubt, it is now
said, that the withdrawal will be
promptly agreed to when the commis
sion meets the conferees then turning
their attention to the drafting of a
portocol to cover future border opera
tions, investigation of the causes of
bandit raids, and such other matters
an they may wish to take up.
No intimation came from the White
House today as to when announci mciil
of the American membership of the
commission might be expected. In view
of Secretary Lansing' recent assur
ances to Kliseo Arredondo, Mexican
Ambassador-designate- that the com
mission could be assembled very soon,
it was believed lonigut that the names
of the, commissioners would be made
public early next week. Secretary
Lansing, who will head. the delegation,
already haa accepted ihe post, and as
soon as his associates have been
named and the views as to the meeting
place ascertained, an agreement on that
point will be reached by Secretary
Lansing and Mr. Arredondo.

serting that the present government at
Washington has been an "administra-
tioi. of words," Senator Henry Cabot
Lodge made his opening speech of the
presidential campaign at an puting of
the Republic an club of Dorchester
here today. Mr. Iodge said In part:
"Behind a great barrier of words,
the president has sheltered himself,
surrounded by a cloud of phrases; big
words with no meaning.
"After the awful disaster of the
Lusitania. the president used the
memorable phrase 'too proud to fight'.
The country responded the next morn
ing. It was not a friendly response.
"So he changed and we had a great
note on 'strict accountability,' and it
remains a phrase. There never has
been a reparation or even an upology
for the Americans drowned or killed
on the Lusitania.
"The same phrase was posted on the
consulate of Mexico not long ago that
if any Injury came to Americans,
Mexico would be held strictly account
able. Americans have been killed and
every outrage committed, and 'strict
accountability' still remains the false
and empty phrase.
"Another cry. 'Kept us out of war."

nobody wants to go to war with you."
