Some of the Railroad Presidents
Look upon the Possibility
of Strike as Remote.
SCENES ARE UKAMAilU
Railroad Presidents Are Still
Firm in Their Insistence
for Arbitration.
(IT ASSOCIATED SSCSSI
WASHINGTON Aug. 19?President
Wilson appealed to the railroad ofliclals
today to abandon their insistence
on arbitration of the dispute
Ihreatenlng a nationwide strike and
lo accept his plan of settlement, already
agreed to by the employees,
because in his opinion the railroads
are contending for a plan which it
seemingly is Impossible to apply on
the present situation.
In one of the most dramatic scenes
known to the White House in recent
years, the president declared to the
heads of five hundred billion dollars
worth of properties, assembled a^is
summons: "If a strike commences
the people will know where the responslbilty
rests. It will not be upon
me." A few minutes later he issued
a statement saying, "the public has
a right to expect acceptance of his
plan."
Xo Final Answer Yet.
Refusing acceptance for the pres/?|
ent. but not giving a final answer,
W Hale Holden, president of the Burthirty-tbree
railroad officials, urged
iington road and spokesman for the
nractuent tn unhold the Dian of!
Arbitration and declared that his
plan would "place in peril ali that
has been accomplished in the peaceful
adjustment of labor controversies
by methods of arbitration."
At the close of the conference'Mr.
Wilson summoned to Washington additional
railroad presidents from the
West and East. Executives already
here told him they would confer
among themselves and return next
week, probably Monday. In the meantime,
representatives of both the
roads and the employees will remain
here for informal conferences.
Not Hopeless But Cirave.
The situation tonight was described
by a railroad president or "not
hopeless but grave." It will be at a
standstill until Monday at least. Discussion
of counter proposals and
compromises was current and serious
consideration was given to the possibility
of government operation of the

suit of the day's conferences, It was
stated on good authority that many
of the road presidents looked upon
the possibility of a strike as more remote
than at any time since they
tame to Washington.
Over the week-end it was anticipated
that the railroad officials will
pet into communication with the controlling
financial interests and It still

disguise their Tegret over premature

for discussion by the commission !
from the Mexican viewpoint will be V
the question of withdrawal of General - t|
Pershing's expeditionary force. In '.\j?

General Punaton was asked to en 'JOB

There Is every indication that thd
