STRIKE ISSUE
TO PRESIDENTS
Shifts the Bunion After

GOVERNMENT MIGHT

Increase in Freight liates
and Tentative Kighl
J lour Uasis Hinted.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 19. Presi
dent Wilson appealed to the
railroad officials today to abandon
their insistence on arbitration of the
dispute threatening a nation-wide
strike and to accept his plan of set
tlement, already agreed to by the
employes, because in his opinion tho
railroads are contending for a prin
ciple wjiich It seemingly Is impossible
to apply to the present situation.
In one of the most dramatic scenes
known to the White House in recent
years, the president declared to the
heads of five billion dollars' worth
of properties assembled at his sum
mons: "If a strike comes, the public will
know where the responsibility rests.
It will not bo upon me."
A few minutes later ho Issued a
statement savins- the public has a right
to expect acceptance of his plan.
Kefusing acceptance for tho pres
ent but not giving a final answer,
Jlale Hidden, president of the Mur
lington road and spokesman for tho
33 railroad officials, urged the pres
ident to uphold the principle of ar
bitration and declared his plan would
"place in peril all that has been ac
complished In the peaceful adjust
ment of labor controversies by meth
ods of arbitration."
Calls More Heads.
At the close of the conference
President Wilson summoned to
Washington additional railroad pres
idents from the west and the ex
ecutives already here told him they
would confer among themselves and
return next week, probably Monday.
Meantime representatives of both the
roads and the employes will remain
here for Informal conferences.
The situation tonight was described
by a railroad president as "not hope
less but crave." It will be at a stand
still until Monday at least.
Discussion of counter proposals
and compromises were current and
serious consideration was given to
the possibility of government opera
tion of the roads in cose of a strike.
As a result of the day's confer
ences, however, It was said on good
authority that many of the road
presidents looked upon the possibility
of a strike as more remote than at
any time since they came to Wash
ington. Over the week-end it was
anticipated that the railroad officials
will get Into communication with the
controlling financial interests and it
still was considered possible that
sumo of the powerful directors of
the roads would be called to Wash
ington. Koth among the employers
and employes talk of arrangement
for a strike continued and for dif
ferent reasons both Bides thhught if
It came it would last less than a
week.
While President Wilson still was
addressing the railroad executives
telling them tliey faced "a condition,
not a principle" his statement to the
country reviewing his plan and char
acterizing It as a "thoroughly prac
ticable and fair program" was given
out at the White House. In the
statement he urged adoption of the
eight-hour day brcauso he "believed
the concession right," suggested the
creation by congress of a small body
of men to investigate the results, and
urged abandonment of the dcBiand
for time and half overtime pay by
the men and "contingent" proposals
by the railroads.
Arbitration Itigtil.
Mr. Holden insisted upon arbitra
tion In his reply to the president,
because "it is essentially the common
rlgVJ of every citizen of w hatever con
dition In life to le heard" and be
cause experience "has put the right
to claim arbitration ns a method of
settling such controversies beyond
question." lie argued that the eight
hour day It impraetlciihl" in railroad
ing and said the roads are willing for
the interstate commerce commission
or uhy other disinterested bodv to ar
bitrate tho whole question. The de
innnd for the eight-hour day Is in
reality, lie dec'ared only an indirect
plea for "an enormous Increase in
wages" and said that "In this In
stance for those demanding a change
to refuse to submit their demands to
arbitration is tindefenslbe,"
W. (I. I,ec. head of tho brotherhood
of railroad ttalnmen, gave nut a brief
statement tonight on behalf of the
men, pointing out that in accepting
President Wl'son's plan the employes
"surrendered a very large portion of
their demand" while the railway
companies " seem about as unwilling
to accept suggestions from the presi
dent of the I'nited States as they have
In the Past refused to consider re
ouests from their employes." He
ndued the workmen would remain
here, but would take no further action
until released by Mr Wilson.
The railroad offkias found two
points in President Wilson's puhllr
statement of his settlement plan that
comforted them and led to a belief
that cventual'y there will be on agree
ment jvcrtlii-5 n strike. The first was
a bint that If the facts warranted the
Interstate commerce commission
might grant an Increase in freight
rates and tho second was a suggestion
on that the eight-hour base would be
accepted onlv tentatively find might

WASHINGTON. Aug. 1 . A rec
ommendation from General
Funston that the American troops be
withdrawn from Mexico was con
tained in a recent report on th" mil
itary situation made at the request
of the war department and disig .e.l
for use of the Joint commission whicn
will discuss border problems. State
department officials do not attempt
to disguise their regret over prima
: tore publication of General Funston's
conclusions, but they Indicated today
I that It would not cause any altera-
tions in plans.
officials realize, it is understood,
i that the most pressing matter for
j discussion by the commission from
I the Mexican viewpoint will be the
nitcRtlnn of withdrawal of General
j Pershing's expeditionary force. In
order to furnish the American eom-
mlsfioners with full information,
I tSem-rul Funston was asked to ex
' press his views on the military as
pects of the expedition. There Is ev
ery Indication that the commission
ers, and later the administration, were
expected to abide by the recommen
dations of the chief military adviser
! on border matters. I'liniu ation of
i the fact that General Funston br
I lleves It wise to withdraw the troops
may hamper the American commis
sioner.", some officials think, In ob
i tainlng whatever guarantees th- y
I may ask of the .Mexican ?ovei nment
'as to security of the bolder fronni
bandit reids. It is believed the ad
ministration was fully prepared to ar
range fcr the recall of General Per
shing's force, since both state and
war department officials are under
stood to share the views expressed
in ("cneral Funston's report
There can he little doubt, It now
is said, that the withdrawal will be
promptly agreed to when the com
mission meets, the conferees then
turning their attention to the draft
ing of a protocol to cover future bor
der operations. Investigation of the
causes of bandit raids and such other
matters lis they may wish to take up.
No intimation j-ame from the White
House today "s to when announce
ment of tho American membership of
the commission might be expected.
In view of Secretary Ijinsing's re
cent assurances to Elisco Arredondo,
Mexican ambassador-designate, that
the commission could be assembled
very soon, it was believed tonight that
the najues of the commissioners
would be made public early next

First communication with Corpus
Christi, Texas, ihowed on Saturday
afternoon that no great damage had
been done to the cily and that there
were no fatalities there. Portions of
that city, notably the section popu
lated by summer visitors, were under
three feet of water today, with ap
parently little chance of immediate
d rainage.
Greatest property damage was In
that quarter, where the Corpus
iteach hotel, a large summer bot.-l.
was partially unroofed by the heavy
gale, and thai the structun was con
siderably shaken. All guests had
been removed, however, and there
were no casualties. Summer cot
tages, bathing pavilions and a pleas
ure pier In Mint section were en
tirely demolished.
Tlu hmino s S'-etion c -vi.'is
Christi was not damaged beyond the
breaking of scores of plate-glass
windows and the rising of the waters
in Corpus Christi bay about a block
toward the business section. :
Saturday afternoon, it w is said, most
of the water had bei n drained off.
The food and water situation there
was gdod, it was last r. purled. The
city's water supply comes from an
Island point, and was not materially
impaired. While wholesale houses
were hurt to some extent by the
storm, none of their wares was dam
aged beyond usage. Generally speak
ing, the damage to Cot pus Christi
was not great.
Interest has centered on the effect
of the storm at Port Aransas and
Aransas Pass, in the absence of def
inite word from those points, Fach
is a popular tismng resort, us well
as a shipping center of more or (ess
Importance on the lower Texas coast.
It was pointed out as probable that
these points might have felt the
storm more severely than did Corpus
Christi.
It developed Saturday night, when
further Information was obtained,
that the fatalities repotjterl during
the day at Rock port haof been con
fused with the drowning of ten men
of the crew of the steamer Pilot
Hoy, which sunk off Aransas Pass
Friday afternoon. These were tho
only deaths from the storm.
SAN ANTONIO. Texas. Aug. 19.
Railroads and other public utilities
operating through the storm-strii ken
district suffered damages aggregating
more than $.100,000 exclusive of losses
in Corpus Christi, llrownsville and
other points In the storm center.
It probably will take the San An
tonio and Aransas Pass railroad a
week or ten days to restore service to
Corpus Christi and it may be 15 days
before lis trains run to Itockport.
The damage to the railroad's prop
erties may reach $150,000. It lost a
mile of the deck of the two-mile
trestle enterinr Corpus Christi and
perhs ps three miles of embankment
near Portland. The piling of the por
tion of the trestle swept away stands.
The roof of tho depot at Alice was
taken off by the wind. The depot at
San Antonio was damaged. Many
small bridges between Aransas Pass
and Rock port are gone. The damage

the official statement issued shortly
