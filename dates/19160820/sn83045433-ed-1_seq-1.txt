WILSON READY
TO QUIT MEXICO
Funston Reports That Persh
ing's Troops May Now Be
Safely Withdrawn.
President Wilson has taken the first
steps toward withdrawing Gen. Pershing's
expeditionary force from Mexico.
High army officials predicted yester
lay that all American troops would be
but of Mexico by September 15.
The State Department seked the War
Department on Friday to get a report
from Gen. Funston an to whether Persh
Ing's troops could be safely withdrawn
from Mexico at the present time.
Gen. Funston replied Friday night that
there was no longer any military neces
sity to hold the troops in Mexico.
Secretary Baker conferred with the
President yesterday. Ie refused either
to deny or confirm the report that the
troops were to be withdrawn.
Leaving the White House, he said:
"No orders for the withdrawal of the
troops have been issued and none are in
contemplation today."
Carranza has insisted that the first
riuestion to he considered by the joint
border commission was the withdrawal
3f the American troops.
President Wilson insisted on broadening
the scope of the commission's work, to
Include questions of finances. border pa
trol, and protection of American lire and
property.
The' elimination of the main question,
the settlement of which caused the sug
gestion of the appointment of the com
mission, leaves nothing but the second
ary questions to be considered.
It is now seriously suggested that thel
commission may never meet. The Army
and Navy Journal takes this view. and
points out that with all of the American
troops off of Mexican soil no differences
will exist hetween the Mexican and
American governments, and therefore
there would be nothing for the commis
Aon to arbitrate.

These were the days' significant prob

Chester Rowell. Progressive leader and
member of the Republican National 'ain

While Rowell was giving a red-hot talk
against Hughes at the Palace the stand

luncheon in the Comigsrcial Club which
was servea by strike-breakers after the

PLAYGROUNDS
NOT TO OPEN
Ruling by Superintendent Will
Keep Sixty School
Tracts Idle.
The playgrounds of the public schools of
the Dietrict will not be thrown open to
children this sunimer.
A rulin;; of Superintendent of Schools
Ernest 1. Thurston. just issued. puts an
end to plans to open up the sixty school
playgrounds for the use of Washington
children during the summer months.
Mrs. Susie Root Rhodes, superintendent
3f playgrounds, appealed to the Board of
Education early in July to allow her to
use these playgrounds, well located, psro
vided with proper apparatus, and of no
ise to anyone during the school vacation
period. They made no objection, leaving
the matter to the supedtntendent of
schools.
Mr. Thurston finally gave Mrs. Rhodes
permission to use four of the schooll
grounds, provided they be closed at 41
3'clock. when the school Janitor left, and
further restricting the uses of the priv
ilege.
These limitations made It impossible for
Mrs. Rhodes to accept the offer, so the
crounds will continue to lIe idle while the
:housands of children of the District must
be taken care of in the best manner pos
mible in the ten municipal playgrounds.
One more playground will be added this
week, however. Mrs. Rhodes yesterday
was in receipt of a letter from Brig. Gens.
r'imothy E. WIlcoxc. U. S. A., retir'ed,
stating that he had two vacant lots in
Columsbia road, near Eighteenth street,
which he would be glad to have used as
playgrounds, merely asking that they be

By the middile of this week the new
playground will be ready for service, ac

President Sarnuel Gompers. of the t
American Federation of Labor. occupied'
the front and center of the stage in the I
Senate yesterday, with Senator Reed, of 1
Missouri, aligned on his ,ide and Senator s
Sherman, of Illinois, renewin:; his attack
made last Tuesday.
Senator Shermark denounced the labor t
leader as a public nuisance and a public
peril and a distinct detriment to the ad- I
vancement of organized labor.
lie rehearsed the history of the Ale-*
Namara dynatmilers and read a i-tte:
from the labor chief showing that he had
attempted to defend the Mc.Namaraa and]
had Instigated the raising of $190.000 to
defend them because they were working
in the interests of union labor.
Senator Sherman declar-d that Gom-'
pers did not r-epresent the real union
worker, and expressed a belief that the
cause of organized labor would not ad
vance unless it followed leaders who
counselled conformity to the law and the
adjudication of differences without re
course to politics or intimidation.
In defense of Gompers. Senator Reed
said he was extremely sorry that men
on the Senate door were immune from
actions for libel and slander, and added:
"There are men in this body who by
their words andc sets have not brought
luster upon it, but only the most narrow
and indecent man would say that such
men represent the membership of the
Senate."
