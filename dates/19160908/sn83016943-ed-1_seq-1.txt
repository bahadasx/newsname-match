CON
FROM THE PEOPLE
Anant tkt Grand Jury Rtport
Editor Beacon:
Having seen in last week's
Beacon tha report of the Grand
Jury, and that the foreman of
said Grand Jury saw fit to take a
fling at us three citizens of this
neighborhood, for certain criti
cisms that we made as to the
hasty adjournment of said body
at the last term of court. Which
criticisms were jur.t and well
founded; for the reason that we
knew of some very material wit
nesses as to the cattle stealing In
our neighborhood had never been
summoned before the Grand Jury,
And a list of names was handed
to all of the Grand Jurors by Mil
ton Love and another list was
handed to another member of the
body by W. A. Williams on Tues
day a. m. and some of these par.
ties were never before the Grand
Jury until it was reconvened
And we hold for this reason the
Grand Jury ought to have been
criticized ana recalled. And as
for the statement that we failed
to give the same information on
the first day of the Grand Jury's
session as we did after it was re
called. Our oaths specified that
we would give true answers to all
questions propounded to us, and
we did so in all particulars and as
for the statement that the three
citizens of this neighborhood
failed at either session of the
last Grand Jury to answer all
questions propounded to them
and withheld any information
that was sought by said Grand
Jury, as a matter of hearsay, the
statement we say is unjust, un
fair, unwarranted and absolutely
untrue in its entirety, and the
County Attorney and the Fore
man of the Grand Jury know it to
be so. We observed our oaths to
the letter of the law in all particu
lars and another reason all three
of us asked for the recall - of 1 the
Grand Jury was that we had come
into possession of some more in
formation as to the cattle stealing
in our neighborhood which infor
mation we didn't have on Monday
or Tuesday a. m.
Our consciences are clear in this
matter and we are willing to be
judged by our fellowmen and by
our God as to the rectitude of our
conduct in this matter. And we
do think that the flings and the
innuendoes that the Foreman of
the Grand Jury threw at us, was,
to say the least, uncalled for and
entirely without precedent as far
as I know in Noxubee county,
where two of us were born and j
raised and the other has resided
for more than twenty-eight years.
This is the first time our charact
ers for truthfulness has ever been
called into question.
This is written so that the peo
ple of the county may know that
we did our whole duty as we saw
it and we resent the slur cast on
us and our good names by the
Foreman of the Grand Jury and
we want the blame, if there is any
for the hasty adjournment and re
call of the Grand Jury to be
placed just where it rightfully be
longs, lor we are sure that we are
blameless.

Estimate of Coat of Draining
Noxubet
The drainage district now has 36,000
acres; of these about 25,000 will re
main after the survey.
I wish to submit this calculation for
your consideration, and I believe that
it is the very maximum cost, and that
when the work is done the cost and
the tax will be far less than the calcu
lation here made. But in going into
any matter we should look at it with
the possible maximum cost before us.
I make my calculations on a ditch 52
Teet wide at the top, 40 feet wide at
:he bottom, 9 feet deep, and the dirt
piles 10 feet from the edge of the
ditch, making a levy on each side 4
feet high.
Now that will give a ditch 72 feet
wide at the top and 40 feet wide at the
bottom and 13 feet deep. Thia is a
large average and you will readily see
hat the ditch required will not reach
this average. But we must make a
ditch big enough or we have wasted
our money. Now the dug part of this
ditch will be the name as if it was
3 yards deep and 16 yards wide, or 48
rSps yrda for each running yard.
... iman ...J. I- . illa Mr
Will Robbing stated on an enterprise
of this magnitude we could expect a
bid of 6 cents a yard including clearing
the right of way. In that way we find
one yard, that is running yard, will
cost $2 88. one mile $5000; length of
ditch including laterals (laterals
miles), 35 miles; cost or ditch averag
ing 80 feet at top, 40 at bottom, 16
feet deep, $175,000; benefitted drainage
area, 25,000 acres; cost or ditch per
acre benefitted, 17.00; allowing $12,500
for the other expenses, cost per acre,
$7.50; the interest will each year be 45
cents, at the end of the time the in
terest will be a little less than 3 cents.
If we make an assessment of 50 cents
an acre for 5 years and 75 cents an
acre for fifteen years, it will pay prin
cipal and interest. If we have 30 year
bonds this will be greatly reduced but
run for a longer time. In this way
we can reclaim 25,000 acres of the very
finest type of soil, and if our lands en
hance as they have done in other dis
tricts the land will be worth from $50
to $150 an acre.
I have tried to figure the very maxi
mum. I believe that when the work is
complete we will find that it can be
paid for in 20 years at a cost of GO
cents an acre. Charles Strong,

. While living in Cleveland, Ohio, some
years ago, my son, while coming home
from school one day, saw an old Irishwo
man looking down the slot of a cable car.
He asked if he could help her, thinking
that probably she had lost something.
She answered that it was information she
was after.
Now I, also, would like some informa
tion. Yesterday I was notified teat I had to
send all my men and teams to the rood, or
else had the alternative of paying $20 for
four mules and four hands. In the spring
I had to send all the mule and hands to
the cross roads. I pay now almost double
taxes for good roads, so why should I
have to work them the same as I had to
before the extra taxes. One eross road
the county works and the other side the
farmers have to work. Why is it that
one side does not work either road, and
the other side both roads.
I amnlady and bu not care abuut wo
men holding office or voting, but if I did
I think I would try to put one in that
would have some consideration for anoth
er woman. I have a large dairy milk
fifty cows. Mr. Johnson has but one hand
that he could milk with the other was
badly hurt some years ago, and besides is
in poor health. There is only my daugh
ter and myself beside. What time could
we get through, if at all, milking fifty
cows, feeding forty-six calves, separating
all that milk and feeding mules and horses.
I wish that some of those gentlemen who
are responsible for taking every hand off
the place would come and try it. Noxu
bee county is advocating that farmers go
in the dairy business for my parti would
not advise any one to go in the dairy bus
iness, knowing that every hand can be
taken, when the commissioners, or who
ever has the attending to the roads, say
so, or to be told that $20 must be paid,
which I had to do or have about 80 tons
of hay in the field for a week, besides
having to do all the rest of the work our
selves. Labor is scarce at this time of
year and with all my teams on the road I
could not work in hay and that is ahout
all the crop there is to pay the taxes in
the fall. Why could not these roads have
been worked before, and not wait until
people are filling their silas, making hay
and getting in their crops.
I have owned land in Noxubee county
for thirty years, and have lived here for
eighteen years and expect to end ray
days here, but think that the gentlemen
who set in town and order every hand
and team on the road from the dairy farm
of fifty cows, will have to make other
arrangement before dairying is a success
in Noxubee county. If only a part of
the hands and a part of the teams were
takea at a time it would not be so bad.
Now I am like the old Irish woman, I
would like some information as to why
the labor question is so badly arranged
and why the labor questfon is so badly
arranged and why we have to do so much
work on the road.

Meeting of Club Members
The clnb members of the county held
their annual rally at the Agricultural
High School on Thursday, the twenty
fourth of August. Although there
were a good number of boys and .girls
of each club in attendance, a large per
cent of our membership were not on
hand. The distance and in many cases
lack of a way to get there prevented
those who wished to go. The members
themselves did not enjoy the day more
nor find it more profitable than did the
parents who came to hear the agents
talk and demonstrate their work.
At the morning session, Mr. P. H.
Sanders, state agent for pig club work,
talked to the boys in a very interest
ing manner along the line of pig club
work and also corn club work. He ex
pressed himself as being very much
gratified with the results the boys were
getting, gave them definite instruc
tions as to the method of most success
fully continuing the contest.' He
found that there are boys and girls in
the club who have some of the very
best of registered hogs; and that thev
hart been foedlrj and caring for thorn

at a small coBt but showing remark
able gains.
The year has not been very favorable
to the corn club boys, but they too
show that they are raising better corn
than their fathers on the same kind of
land. The boys who have stuck to the
contest this yeajr are the ones who will
be worth while in the future; it makes
one good to see a boy enthusiastic
over what he has been able to do in
spite of the adverse seasons.
Miss Saidee Holiday of the A. & M.
and Mrs. Annette Tyndall, county
home economics agent, presented the
work for the tomato club girls. A
very interesting demonstration in the
actual canning of tomatoes was given
by these ladies. Mrs. Tyndall ought
not to have any trouble in enrolling at
least a hundred girls in this club next
year. She is expecting the girls who
have been faithful this year to be the
leaders in the work next season; and
some of them have not only been faith
ful but have gotten very satisfactory
yields.
Now, I am going to announce the
closing day of the contests as the 14th
of October. This will be Saturday,
when almost every boy in the county
can come to Macon. The teachers of
the county will be here to greet the
boys and girls who are in the clubs,
and to show them that they are inter
ested in them. Some of the boys and
girls have possibly not been able to
make a very good showing with their
pig or their corn patch or their toma
toes; but I want to urge every one of
you to be sure to come and make your
report on closing day. Every one can
not be a winner, every year some for
different causes for which they are not
responsible will make almost a com
plete failure. That does not make any
difference; make your report and show
that you have been trying. The state
agents are especially anxious that all
members make some kind of a report.
I will be writing you in a few days
about tnia exhibit day it is exhibit
day because every boy and girl is

ELLSWORTH PLUMSTEAD
A little girl described this man
as "the fellow who is lots of
folks." It was so apt that it is
used here to introduce Mr. Plum
stead as a man capable uf delin
eating character. When he
leaves the platform one feels
that he has been in the presence
of a group of people all difTerent,
but each perfectly represented
by the many-sided genius of
Plumstead. He is from Detroit,
Mich., and has been on the plat
form for many years always in
demand and always satisfactory.
In the afternoon he give3 some
humorous sketches of people
we have either met or read
about, such as the "boy and the
buckwheat cakes." "The Eng
lish Dude," and "the fellow and
the girl who compels her sweet
heart to wait while she puts up
her hair." At night his pro
gram is given in costume when
he tells about Uncle Ezra singing
bass in the church choir. He
gives a thrilling representation
of J. T. Trowbridge "The Vaga
bond," or describes the worn
out actor on Broadway -and his
observations on his triumphs in
the past. His sketches of the
silly boy are humorous in the
extreme. In fact, Mr. Plum
stead can't help being funny.
He looks on the bright side of
life, and leaves his audience in a
happy mood. In addition to this
gift, he ia an artist in his por
trayal of human eccentricities.
