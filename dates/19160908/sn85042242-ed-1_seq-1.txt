F. J. Durant of Sibley Butte
Twp. Charged With Wound­
ing Bismarck Man.
BULLET WAS SOFT-NOSED
AND COPPER-JACKETED
Victim May Not Live Accused,
Officials Declare, Admits Fir­
ing Twice.
J. P. Spies, 213 First street, was
seriously injured yesterday morning
by a farmer living ten miles north of
McKenzie, who shot him in the head
with a .38 caliber rifle, the 'bullet
grazing the base of the brain, because
Mr. Spies shot a chicken on the road
adjoining his farm.
He was operated on yesterday af­
ternoon at the St. Alexius hospital by
Dr. IM. W.. Roan of Roan, Fisher &
Strauss. While he was in consider­
able pain last night, he was resting
comparatively easy, but, the doctors
declared, that he was not by any
means out of danger.
iDurant Placed Under Arrest.
F. J. Durant was placed under ar­
rest by Sheriff French, charged with
the shooting. He is said to have ad­
mitted the shooting, but to have de­
clared that he did not intend to hit
anyone.
According to the story told by Mr.
Spies, he and H. H. Ludwig were re­
turning from Rice lake, where they
had gone for ducks, when they saw
a prairie chicken fly up from the
roadside. They slowed the machine
and he shot.
Tells Him to Leave Chicken.
Mr. Ludvig got out to get the chick­
en just as the farmer came across
'the field and ordered him to leave it
alone. Mr. Spies told him to bring it
along and he did. As they started off
in the car the man fired twice, i»oth
occupants 'diving down in the car.
The first shot hit Mr. Spies and the
'second glanced off the machine. The
bullet passed through the outside of
the "ear and through the mastoid bone
to the base of the brain.
It was removed
Mr. Spies was a total stranger to
him. The county officials declare
that there was no motive for shoot­
ing other than the shooting of the
chicken.
Dr. .Roan declares that if the bullet
had struck either lower or higher it
would have meant instant death.
Mr. Spies is unmarried. .He is a
traveling salesman for W. S. Nott.

SLEUTH'S CONVICTION
HAS BEEN REVERSED
Fargo, N. D., Sept. 7.—The United
States circuit court of appeals at Den­
ver, Col., has reversed the conviction
of the federal court here in the case of
Arthur J. Gillette, convicted under the
Mann white slave act July, 1915, on
his second trial, and sentenced one
year and six months in the federal
penitentiary. The reversal of this rath­
er noted case was secured by Gil­
lette's attorney, George R. Bangs, of
Grand Forks.
Gillette was hired by the state's at­
torney of Traill county to investigate
alleged infractions of the bawdy house
and prohibition laws at Galesburg and
some convictions were secured in the
state court at Hillsboro. Then came a
sensation when one of the girls con­
victed furnished the federal authori­
ties with alleged evidence that Gil­
lette had violated the Mann act, alleg­
ing Gillette had taken her to Moorhead
where he bought her a supper and
liquid refreshments for purposes in
violation of the Mann act, and the pre­
liminary examination was held on the
day on which the trials were to be be­
gun at Hillsboro.
Mr. Gillette was tried twice in fed­
eral court. The first time the jury dis­
agreed, standing 11 to 1 for acquittal.
There were four counts to the indict­
ment and at the last trial the jury con­
victed on one count and Mr. Gillette
was discharged on the other three. He
was sentenced to a year and six
months in the penitentiary. An appeal
was made to the United States circuit
court of appeals.

age work in Clay county aggregating
$68,954, in addition to about $00,000
worth of work under way, is being

university students.
Orders for the mustering out of ad­
ditional units are expected soon.
New York Infantry Next to Leave
The next regiment to leave the fed­
eral service will be the 14th New York
infantry, which will go as soon as its
members are freed from danger of
pera-t.vphoid contagion. A number of
cases of the disease already have been
reported in that regiment, and it will
be held in camp as a matter of precau­
tion until the infection has been eradi­
cated. Surgeon General Georgas said
today a vigorous campaign against the
disease was being waged, and that he
expected to see it stamped out prompt­
ly.
Others to be Sent Soon.
There are about 40,000 guardsmen
still in state mobilization.camps, and
these probably will be dispatched to
the border very soon to relieve men
serving there. Secretary Baker fav­
ors giving all the state troops a chance
for the training to be acquired on the
patrol line.
Today's orders were construed by
some officials as a preliminary to the
withdrawal of General Pershing's reg­
ulars-fwai Mexico-,
Officers of the general staff insisted,
however, that the release of the
guardsmen resulted from the improv­
ed conditions on the border.

proved and Will Go to
Wilson .Today.
GENERAL DEFICIENCY
BILL IS ADOPTED
Many Members Have Already
Left Washington for Their
Homes.
Washington, Sept. 7.—Congress
will adjourn tomorrow morning at 10
o'clock. After nine months devoted
to legislation, both houses held pro­
tracted sessions tonight to wind up
their affairs by approving the confer­
ence agreement on the emergency
revenue bill, to raise approximately
$200,000,000 desired by the adminis­
tration to meet the, Extraordinary ap­
propriation for imuonal defense and
the Mexican emergency.
Only the physical impossibilities of
engrossing the revenue measure in
time for the president's approval be­
fore tomorrow morning prevented
final adjournment tonight, despite the
waning protest of members of both
nouses, who threatened but did not
execute the threat to prolong the
session by demands lor action on
measures which were forced over un­
til December.
Many Have Already Left.
Leaders of the senate and house
agreed upon a concurrent resolution
to adjourn at 10 o'ekek in the morn­
ing, and scores of members left town
on midnight trains, eager to reach
their homes for participation in the
national political campaign.
Deficiency Bill Adopted.
The last appropriation measure,
die general deficiency bill, was adopt­
ed by both houses, wb-ile awaiting for
the conference report on the revenue
bill and the Danish treaty to provide
for purchase of the Tanish West In­
dies for $25,'000,000, w.«s ratified. The
corrupt, priitices hiU to limit cam­
paign expenditures, and the immigra­
tion bill, which President Wilson had
announced if passed, were put aside
and will be taken up and pressed to
a vote early in the December session.
The revenue bill, as it will go to
President Wilson for approval tomor
row, contains drastic provisions em
powering the president to retaliate
against foreign interference with Am­
erican commerce, creates a non-par­
tisan tariff commission, increases the
duties on dyestuffs to encourage their
manufacture in the United States,
provides means to prevent dumping
of cheap foreign made goods into
American markets after the war, and
provides for income, inheritance, mu
nitions, corporation stocks, liquor and
miscellaneous internal revenue tax­
es.
During consideration of the report
in the senate, Senator Chamberlain
of Oregon protested vigorously
against elimination by the conference
committee of a retaliatory provision
against Canadian control of Pacific
coast fisheries, and Representative
Gardner of Massachusetts enlivened
the house with bitter denunciation of
the retaliatory provision against for­
eign interference with American com­
merce.
Final Vote Delayed.
The final vote on the revenue bill
was delayed in the senate by a vig­
orous protest from Pacific ^toast sen­
ators against the elimination of the
Alaskan fisheries amendment. It was
after midnight when a vote on ad­
journment tomorrow appeared to be
in sight.
The senate at 12:55 tonight adopt­
ed the conference report on the rev­
enue bill without a record vote, clear­
ing the way for adjournment of con­
gress at 10 o'clock tomorrow morn­
ing.

Shopmen
Ask Wage
Increase
Chicago, Sept. 7.—With the threat
ened strike averted, railroad execu
tives of 22 western lines resumed ne­
gotiations today at Chicago, Kansas
City and elsewhere with representa­
tives of 25,000 shopmen who are seek­
ing higher pay and reduced hours.
The shopmen are negotiating with
the 22 roads simultaneously, but not
collectively.
The demands, according to railway
executives, are for an increase of
5 cents an hour in wages and for an
eight-hour day. Shopmen of some
roads now work ten hours and others
nine. The increase and time reduc­
tion, according to railway officials,
would total perhaps $$,000,000 a year.
Where the open shop policy exists,
the railways are dealing witti the
shopmen not as unions, but as repre­
sentatives of the employes.

ican commissioners had found many
hopeful suggestions. Conditions in

TO IM CROWDS
Addresses Five Audiences in New
England States Assails
Eight-Hour Enactment.
Portland, Me., Sept. 7.—Charles E.
Hughes told a New England audience
today that he would rather stand for
the principle of reason in legislation
and go down to defeat than to yield
"one jot or tittle" of it and become
president of the United States.
Before five crowded audiences in
Massachusetts, New Hampshire and
Maine, the nominee assailed the ad­
ministration vigorously for the enact­
ment of the Adamson eight-hour law.
He called it not an 'eight-hour law,
but a wage law" said it was passed
"confessedly in ignorance of the facts"
and asserted that while it had been
said in its favor that society favored
the eight-hour day, society had noth­
ing to do with the measure, and de­
clared emphatically "that kind of
virus in our life" would bring the na­
tion to disaster in the end.

In addition, great aerial activity
was shown by British and French avi
