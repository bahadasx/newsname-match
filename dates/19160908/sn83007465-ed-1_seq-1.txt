PLAN FOR FIGHT
TO SECURE BALLOT
EVERYTHING AT ONCE
Declared That Federal Amendment
Only Can Be Enough to
Satisfy Them. *
Atlantic City, N. J., Sept. 7.?After
a long dehate, which carried the
afternoon session of the convention
well Into the evening, the National
American Woman Suffrage association
today adopted a platform i tlining
its plan of campaign for securing
the submission of the federal
suffrage amendment to the State leg
isiaiure ror rati n call on.
It wm decided that the next annual
convention in 1917 be held in
March or "thereabouts;" that a lobby
he continued at Washington and that
the association conduct a nation wide
campaign of education, agitation, organization
and publicity in support
of the federal amendment. A million
dollar campaign fund is to be
raised between October, this yertr.
and October, 1917.
f It was further agreed that no
State association shall ask the logislatue
of its State for th esubmission
of an amendment or referendum to
the people until the national board of
executive council of the association
shall have been given the opportunity
to investigate conditions and give
consent. Any State organization
which proceeds to such a suggestion
without consent must be prepared
to finance and conduct its campaign
without help from the national body.
Other steps are also to be taken to
standardize and nationalize the woman
suffrage movement.
Tangle Over Platform.
The convention got into a tangle
over the method of considering the
platform, many parliamentary moves
being made to postpone Immediate
consideration or have the numerous
items in it taken up seriatim. Intimations
were made that a steam roller
was being used to put the platform
through the convention, hut In
the end It was adopted without
amendment.
Then followed another debate on
the resolution of President Carrie
Chapman Catt, presented yesterday,
which Interprets the constitution to
mean that the submission of the federal
amendment is the Immediate and
principal aim of the association and
that all State work is merely preparation
for that end.
Finally many of the delegates became
weary of the long session and
when a motion was made to postpone
consideration it was quickly adopted
end the resolution was fixed for the
first order of business tomorrow
morning. ~
Tells of long Fight.
The annual address of the president
was one of the features of the
day's proceedings, Mrs. Catt reviewing
the suffrage movement in many
States for years back. The keynote
of her speech was that "woman's
hour has struck."
The evening session was given over
to listening to apaches by Southern
women. It was called "Dixie evening."
Speakers were Mrs. B. J. Cunningham,
president of the Texas Woman
Suffrage association; Mrs. Thomas
Jefferson Smith, president of the
Kentucky Equal Rights association;
Mrs. Guilford Dudley, president of
ttih TannMOAO k .nil.. finff rn cro fioan.
elation; Mrs. T. T. Cotnam, vice president
of the Arkansas Woman Suffrage
association.
President Wilson, who will address
the delegates tomorrow night, will
bare a guard of honor of yellow ribboned
women as he enters the Board
Walk theatre, where he will speak.
Every State in the Union will be represented
in the guard, which will
form in two lines and salute the
* president as he passes between them.

The enthusiasm of this great Sun'

immense crowd present.
This was the second meeting of
J the convention under the leadership
of our able president, Mr. John T.
^ Oieen of Lancaster. He is a man
with strong and energetic powers,
v and inspires all with whom he comes
in contact. We believes he is the
right man in the rlght place,
t After devotional exercises by Mr. i
P|R. L. Beaty of Lancaster, the meeting I
t|vas called to order by the district
(. president, Mr, A. C. Rowell. Mr.
Rowell was elected president of this i
i district at a recent meeting of the
j convention in I>anca?ter. The dis
trict Is indeed fortunate in securing
II him as thoir president. He works
| with a never-tiring will and is always
" ! ready to do all in his power for the
{ advancement of any good work.
' Prof. B. H. Clyburn was elected secrotary
of this convention.
First on the program was an ade
dress by'Rov. B. F. Carson on the
r'subject of "Church to Sunday
School."
?| Mr. Carson being absent the Dresi
dent appo'nted Mr. John Green to
discuss the subject. Mr. Green's talk
' van forceful and full of facts. It conditioned
much pood advice to all members
of a church and Sunday school.
fk
He stressed the duty as officers of the
ichurch In relation to *he Sunday
school. showing that w<hen the Runiclay
school fall* below the mark of lt?
work the officers of the church are
largely responsible. He brought out
the fact that no Sunday school could
p rise higther than Its officers.
Next on the program was an ad-|
d dress by Mr, W. C. Kills, district
e [ resident of the second district. "The|
I. Tuity of the Sunday School to the
?' Church." He madg mention of the
n fact that when all members of a Sun-i
a day school arise to their full duty to
p this great work It would advance
( with leaps and bounds as have never
"lleen heard of before,
r. The three main points in this die- |

ing. Ilis talk wsis practical and full
of information.
Following this speaker was an ab'.e|
plea for the practical value of the
Cradle Roll by Miss Lillie Usher. This
address showed careful consideration
ol the subject and furnished wholesome
food for all present. Sh<
showed in a most nlo!ism<* wow s*... i
this organization is one of the noblest
and grandest of all our work
in the Sunday school.
Next on the program was an addross
by Mr. H. I). Webb, State secretary.
on the subject of "The Banner
Sunday School."
Mr. Webb outlined the tendifferent
points necessary to become a bannerj
Sunday school. He advised thatj
each Sunday school adopt a syste
matic way of transacting the work
of the school. He showed how i.m
portant punctuality and regularity
were in school work, and along with
this he stressed the needed importance
of grading and classifying the
schools. His talk was very instruc-|
tive and thoroughly enjoyed by all!
present.
At the close of his address Mr.1
Webb handed out statistical blanks'
to the following young ladies: Misses]
Eunice Steele, Thelma Threatt, Lou-j
ise I?orter and Irene Bennett, who;
had been appointed as a comknittee
to solicit subscriptions to the Sunday;
School Promoter during the recess
hour.
At 12:30 the eonvention adjourned
for dinner which was bountifully
spread in the huge grove of Dixie.
All ate hearitly and enjoyed themselves
in a social way till 2 o'clock.
when the convention reassembled for
the afternoon session.
First on the program was a plea
for an organized class by Mr. R. I).
Webb. The real advantage in having
one is to hold the young men and
young ladies in the Sunday school. A
duty is placed upon earth member,
thus making btm feel his responsibility
to his class.
Ttojs address was most helpful in
organizing one and gave helpful information
to those schools which already
have organized classes.
The next speaker was Miss Marie
Craig. who discussed "Practical
Methods of Improving Elementary
Work." Her delivery was most pleasing
and the thoughts and plans
brought out during the discussion
were very practical and helpful in
this line of work. Her great plea
was to Introduce hand work into the
Sunday school, by so doing the line
of thought 1? impressed more deeply
upon the minds of the children. |

GOVERNOR MANNING AND
BLEASE BOTH CONFIDENT
OUTLOOK FOR TUESDAY
Both Candidates Feel Sure ol
Victory?Friends of Both
Working Diligently.
Yesterday the News requested both
Governor Manning and Cole Blease
to furnish us short statements as to
the outlook for Tuesday's election
Both answered promptly.
For the information of our many
readers, we publish herewi a therir
replies:
Richard I. Manning Headqi irters
Columbia. S. C.
September 7, 1916
Lancaster News,
Lancaster, S. C.
Gentlemen: Your wire received .
Complying with your request we
wish to say that the Manning and
Cooper leaders in every county in the
State are working vigorously and
systematically for the re-election of
Governor Manning. Our friends ar?
keenly alive and will get out a full
vote next Tuesday. There is an enrollment
of about 160,000 votes, a
majority of whom are anti-Blease.
Earnest individual effort to get out
the vote for good government will
surely give us the victory.
.ours very truiy,
M. C. McLAIN.
Cole L. Blease Headquarters,
Columbia, S. C.
September 7. 1916
The Lancaster News,
Lancaster, S. C.
Gentlemen: Your telegram received.
Everything is in the very best of
shape. We are getting inside information
from the caucuses being held
on the other side, and find that they
are raising money at every point thev
can. and that this money is being
placed in the hands of various parties
for use on election day. I can
give the names of the parties if necessary.
Our friends are enthusiastic
and all that they have to do now
is to watch the count and the victory
is assured. They should renlembe' ,
however, that a change of two or
three votes at each hox might alter
the result, and that every vote shoul t
be carefully watened. The victory iswon?It
is up to us now to keep It
from being stolen.
COLE L. BLEASE.
LETTER FROM MR. 11EL.K.
'Mr. Editor: Please state in your
next paper that Mr. M. It. Cooper, as
referred to in your last paper, was
not the candidate of governor as
some think.
I can't, for my life, see why that
Edgefield man, who is a Sunday
school worker and an officer in ft
Baptist church, is openly working
for Blease. We may grant this as a
fact, and a remarkable one too, that
[a good Baptist brother was openly
working for Blease. but I have never
yet heard of a blind tiger, criminal or
crook, that was working for Manning,
though that even is possible.
The thing for each voter to do
I next Tuesday is to ask himself the
I question: which candidate represents
his idea of government. Which
stands for law and order, and which
one wishes to represent and develop
that which is highest and nohlest 1n
our citizenship. Then if he is a
voter and wants good government,
let him cast his vote for the man who
will give us the purest and best government,
be It Manning or Blease,
but for my part. I will vote for Manning
who has made us a good law
niui timer governor.
