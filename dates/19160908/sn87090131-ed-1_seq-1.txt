THE POETRY OF POISON. to
The prison regulations at Geneva a
are extremely liberal, so for many a
years prior to 1884, hundreds of tour- c
ists from all over the world were per- a
mltted to see and converse with Marie J
Jeanneret, "the Swiss Brinvilliers." n
Marie's cell was a large, comfortable, n
well-lighted room, and there she-sat, a
day after day, making lace and exult- f,
ing in the fact that her fame was b
world-wide.
Having no conscience, and being in
capable of remorse, Marie has been n
described by the historians of crime r
as a monster. However abhorrent her P
character may have been, there was h
nothing repulsive in her appearance P
"She Mixed Up a Tempting Effervesoent Beverage and Handed It to Berth.
Who Drank It Eaoerlv.
Who Drank
or manners. She was rather short
and slight and her face, pale as mar
ble, was lighted up by large, dark, in
telligent eyes, and she had masses of
beautiful black hair. Her voice was
soft, gentle and caressing, and all her
actions seemed to indicate an affec
tionate, sensitive nature.
When she was tried for her crimes
and convicted, she looked so much like
a martyr that the jurors couldn't find
it in their hearts to assess the death
penalty, which was then the pre
scribed punishment for murder, so she
was given 20 years. The canton legis
lators then reasoned that it would be
unfair to bring any other murderer to
the gallows after permitting her to es
cape, so they abolished capital punish
ment. So Marie did some good in the
world.
She began experimenting with poi
sons when a girl. She seemed to have
a fascination for her. She always kept
in her room a medicine chest, and was
forever toying with Its little boxes and
bottles. One day her room mate, Ber
the Berthet, complained of feeling ill.
The helpful Marie opened her medl- I
cine chest and said: "I know just
what to do for you, my dear." So she
mixed up a tempting effervescent bev
erage and handed it to Berthe, who
drank it eagerly, and a few minutes
later was in a paroxysm of pain. The
landlady heard her screams and sent
for Doctor Lambassy, who saved her
life.
When Berthe had told him of the
drink given her by Marie, the doctor
said: "You have escaped death by a
hair's breadth. The girl made a mis
take that would have been fatal had
there been any delay in sending for
me. She gave you belladonna."
That usually was the verdict when
ever Marie scored a victim. It was
assumed that she had made a mistake.
It was impossible to believe that a
girl with such a gentle, wistful face
could have administered poisons delib
erately.
For a time Marie dispensed her poi
sons as occasion offered, but she want
ed larger opportunities, so she went
into training as a nurse, and, although
she did not finish her course, she had
no trouble in securing employment in
the desired capacity. Nature evident
ly had designed her for service in
the sick room, she was so quiet, so
gentle, so patient, her hands and voice
were so soothing. She went to nurse
Madame Chabloz, and promptly gave
her poison, which brought her to the
edge of the grave, but the madam was
a strong woman, and she rallied.
Madame Juvet of Geneva conceived
the idea of establishing a private hos
pital, and Marie applied for the posi
tioa of head nurse.,
I dont ask for a salary," said the
gentle, soft-eyed girl. "I have private
means, and don't need the money. My
ambition ig to do what good .1 can,
by ministering to the sick and suffer
ing." .
Madame Juvet was sure she had
gained a treasure when she engaged
Marie. The hospital was opened, and
Marie soon was in full control. De
spite her gentle, yielding manners, she
had a will of iron. The madame, as
well as the staff, took their orders
from her. Madame Juvet had two
tbright children, a boy and a girl. Marie
professed to be very fond of them,
and one day she said to the mother:
"I am afraid Julie is very delicate, and
I am sure Emile is about to be seri
ously sick." The mother was amused,
for the children were pictures of
health. Meanwhile Marie told some
of the servants, in strict confidence,
that she was greatly worried over
Madame Juvet. "She is a doomed
woman," said Marie; "I read her fate
in her eyes."
Presently Julie fell sick and then
little Emile, and then Madame Juvet
took to her bed, suffering miserably.
The doctors came and were puzzled.
They seemed to recognize the symp
toms of poisoning, but poisoning was
impossible. Was not all the medicine
administered by that gentle creature
with the yearning eyes? There was so
much sickness in the house that Emile
was sent away, and his life was saved.
Julie grew worse and died at Christ
mas time, 18867, and a month later her
mother died and almost her last word
was an expression of gratitude to the
faithful nurse who had been at her
bedside night and day through so many
weary weeks.
Meanwhile Marie had not been
neglecting her other opportunities.
During the lingering sickness of
Madame Juvet three patients in the
hospital died, and it was afterwards
proved that their deaths were due to
poisod. When Marie had finished her
campaign she and M. Juvet and a
couple of servants were the only sur
vivors of the household.
Then Marie, still intent upon doing
good, went to nurse a Madame Le
noir, and the madame's funeral oc
curred a few days after her arrival.
By this time her reputation as a death
angel was beginning to attract atten
tion, and she found it difficult to get
patients. The strange thing is that
nobody seemed to suspect her up to this
time. Time and again the doctors
had found indications of poisoning in
her suffering patients, and yet they
seemed unable to believe that Marie
could be anything but what she
seemed. It is this that makes the
story of her career remarkable. She
was careless to the point of reckless
ness. She would predict the early
death of people in perfect health, and
when these people died nobody seemed
to see anything strange in it. It
speaks much for her ingratiating man
ner that she could so long be "shak
ing from out her condor wings invisi
ble woe," and still avoid suspicion.
When at last she was arrested, It
was easy to secure the proofs of her
crimes, and the indictment against her
accused her of the murder of nine per
sons. Her attempts at murder were
too numerous for consideration.
She was an artist In crime. She
had none of the ordinary motives. It
was art for art's sake with her. She
never tried to profit by her horrid
deeds. She was willing to work for
nothing any time, if it would give her
a chance to remove somebody. She
was absolutely pitiless and enjoyed
the sufferings of her victims. "Death
had such beautiful moments," she said,
when asked why she committed her
crimes. "There is poetry in poison,"
she remarked, upon another occasion.
She died in 1884, in her little white
cell, and to the last she retained her
weird beauty. Her marble white face,
with its beautiful dark eyes, haunted
the memories of the thousands who
journeyed to Geineva to see the
strangest criminal of modern times.
Just in Style.
"You have a complaint to make
madam?" asked the milkman.
"Yes, I have," said the lady of the
house at the door. "The milk you
have left for three mornings is blue
absolutely blue."
"Well, my dear madam, you must
know that blue is the season's most
fashionable color. Now, If it were
purple or pink you might complain,
but nothing can be more fashionable
than blue Just sew, madam, I. aure

An Impression

A CONSIDIRABLE amount of
nonsense has been written
about the spell of Egypt.
Cheapened by exaggeration,
vulgarized by familiarity, it has be
come for many a picture post card
spell, pinned against the mind like the
posters at a railway terminus. The
moment Alexandria is reached, this
huge post card hangs across the
heavens, blazing in an over-colored
sunset, composed theatrically of tem
ple, pyramid, palm trees by the shin
ing Nile, and the inevitable Sphinx.
And the monstrosity of it paralyzes
the mind. Its strident shout deafens
the imagination. Memory escapes with
difficulty from the insamtent, gross ad
vertisement. The post card and the
poster smotl t sight, writes Algernon
Blackwood, I Country Life.
Behind th.l glare and glitter there
hides, however, another delicate yet
potent thing that is somehow nameless
-not acknowledged by all, perhaps be
cause so curiously elusive yet surely
felt by all because it is so true; in
tensely vital, certal.hiyr-~sne it thus
survives the suffocation of its vile ex
aggregation. For the ordinary tourist
yields to it, and not alone the exca
vator and archeologist; the latter, in
deed, who live long in the country,
cease to be aware of it as an outside
influence, having changed insensibly in
thought and feeling till they have be
come it; it is in their blood. An ef
fect is wrought subtly upon the mind
that does not pass away. Having
once "gone down into Egypt," you are
never quite the same again. Certain
values have curiously changed, per
spective has altered, emotions have
shifted their specific gravity, some at
titude to life, in a word, been empha
sized, and another, as it were, oblit
erated. The spell works underground,
and, being not properly comprehensi
ble, is nameless. Moreover, it is the
casual visitor, unburdened by anti
quarian and historical knowledge, who
may best estimate its power-the tour
1st who knows merely what he has
gleaned, for Instance, from reading
over Baedeker's general synopsis on
the voyage. He is aware of this float
ing power everywhere, yet unable to
fix It to a definite cause. It remains at
large, evasive, singularly fascinating.
Creates Blur In the Mind.
All countries, of course, color
thought and memory, and work a spell
upon the imagination of any but the
hopelessly inanimate. Greece, India,
Japan, Ireland or the Channel islands
leave their mark and imprint-whence
the educational value of travel-psy
chology-but from these the traveler
brings back feelings and memories he
can evoke at will and label. He re
turns from Egypt with a marvelous
blur. All, in differing terms, report a
similar thing. From the first few
months in Egypt, saturated maybe
with overmuch, the mind recalls with
definiteness-nothing. There comes to
its summons a colossal medley that
half stupefies; vast reaches of yellow
sand drenched in a sunlight that
stings; dim, solemn aisles of granite
silence; stupendous monoliths that
stare unblinking at the sun; the shin
ing river, licking softly at the lips of
a murderous desert ; and an enormous
night sky literally drowned In stars. A
score of temples melt down into a
single monster; the Nile spreads
everywhere; great pyramids float
across the sky like clouds; palms
rustle in midair: and from caverned
leagues of subterranean gloom there
issues a roar of voices, thunderous yet
mufled, that seem to utter the hiero
glyphlecs of a forgotten tongue. The
entire mental horizon, oddly lifted,
brims with this procession of gigantic
things, then empties again without a
word of explanation, leaving a litter of
big adjectives chasing one another
chaotically-chief among them "mys
terious," "unchanging," "formidable,"
"terrific ." But the single, bigger mem
ory that should link all these together
intelligibly hides from sight the emo
tion too deep for specific recogaition,
too vast. somehow, for articulate re
covery.
The Acropolis, the wonders of Japan
and India, the mind can grasp-or
thinks so; but this composite enormity
of Ramesseum, Serapeum, Karnak,
Cheops, Sphinx, with a hundred tem
ples and a thousand miles of sand, it
knows It cannot. The mind Is a blank.
Egypt, it seems, has faded. Memory
certainly fails, and description wilts.
There seems nothing precisely to re
port, no interesting, clear, intelligible
thing. "What did you see in Egypt?
What did you like best= What impres
sion did Egypt make upon you?" seem
questions impossible to answer. Imagi
nation flickers, stammers and goes out.
Thought hesitates and stops. A little
shudder, probably, makes itself felt.
There is an important attempt to de
scribe a temple or two, an expedition
on donkeyback Into the desert; but it
sounds unreal, the language wrong,
foolish, even affected. The dreadful
post card rises like a wall. "Oh. I
liked It all immensely. The delight
ful dry heat, you know-and one can
always count upon the weather for
picnics arranged ahead, and-" until
the conversation can be changed to
theaters or the crops at home.
Yet, behind the words, behing the
post card, one is aware all the time of
some huge, alluring thing, alive with a a
pageantry of ages, strangely brilliant,
dignified, magnificent, appealing al
most to tears-something that drifts
past like a ghostly full-rigged vessel
with crowded decks and sails painted
in an underworld, and yet the whole
too close before the eyes for proper
sight. The spell has become operative!
Having been warned to expect this, I,
petsonally, had yet remained skeptical
-until I experienced the truth. ...
And it was undeniably disappointing.
After time and money spent, one had
apparently brought back so little.
Monstrous to Some.
For some, a rather dominant impres.
slon is undoubtedly "the monstrous."
A splendor of awful dream, yet never
quite of nightmare, stalks everywhere,
suggesting an atmosphere of Khubla
Khan. There is nothing lyrical. Even
the silvery river, the slender palms,
the fields of clover and barley and the
, acres of flashing poppies convey no
lyrical sweetness, as elsewhere they
might. All moves to a statelier meas
ure. Stern issues of life and death are
in the air, and in the grandeur of the
tomhs and temples there is a solemnity
of genuine awe that makes the blood
run slow a little.
Those Theban hills, where the kings
and queens lay buried, are forbidding
to the point of discomfort almost. The
listening silence in the grim Valley of
the Tombs of the Kings, the intoler
able glare of sunshine on the stones,
the naked absence of any sign of ani
mal or vegetable life, the slow ap
proach to the secret hiding place
where the mummy of a once power
ful monarch lies ghastly now beneath
the glitter of an electric light, the Im
placable desert, deadly with heat and
distance on every side-this picture,
once seen, rqther colors one's memory
of the rest of Egypt with its somber
and funereal character.
And with the great deifie monoliths
the effect is similar. Proportions and
sheer size strike blow after blow upon
the mind. Stupendous figures, shroud.
ed to the eyes, shoulder their way
t slowly through the shifting sands,
deathless themselves and half-appal
Ing. Their attitudes and gestures er
press the hieroglyphic drawings come
to life. Their towering heads, coiffed
with zodiacal signs, or grotesque with
animal or bird, bend down to watch
t you everywhere. There is no hurry in
them; they move with the leisure of
l the moon, with the stateliness of the
sun, with the slow silence of the con
t stellatlons. But they move. There is,
between you and them, this effect of a!
screen, erected by the ages, yet that
any moment may turn thin and let
them through upon you. A hand of
shadow, but with granite grip, may
steal forth and draw you away Into
some region where they dwell among
changeless symbols like themselves, s
region vast, ancient and. undifferenti
ated as the desert that has produced
them. Their effect In the end is weird,
Sdimfficult to describe, but real. Talk
with a mind that has been steeped for
Syears in their atmosphere and pre
ence, and you will appreciate this odd
reality.
The spell of Egypt Is an other-world
ly spell. Its vagauene, its elausiveness,
Its undeniable reality are Inlgredlents,
at any rate, in a total result whose de
