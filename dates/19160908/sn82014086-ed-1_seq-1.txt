WHY GERMANY YIELDED
TO THE UNITED STATES
Value of Submarine Warfare Exag
gerated, Chancellor's View.
London, Sept. 7. According to def
inite information reaching Berne
Switzerland, from Germany, says
dispatch to the Wireless Press, Dr,
von Bethmann-Hollweg, the German
imperial chancellor, upon being ques
tiord at the August meeting of the
federal council as to why he yielded
to the demands of the United States
regarding the unrestricted torpedoing
of ships on the high seas, reploed em
phatically that the value of the sub
marine was exaggerated by the adher
ents of wholesale torpedoing.
The chancellor said that insistence
on an unrestricted submarine war
fare would cause war between Ger
many and the United States, and that
the. results of unlimited torpedoing
would not justify such a policy. Elab
orating this point, he is quoted as
saying that Germany could not eftec
tively blockade England or cut off
England's food supplies.

President Shonts Assures Normal
Transportation Facilities of Police
Protection is Continued as Good as
Yesterday
New York, Sept. 7. Subway and
elevated transportation lines cn Man
hattan Island were being operated to
night on what officials of the Inter
borough Rapid Transit Company said
were virtually normal schedules, al
though it was admitted that service on
the surface lines of the New York
Railways Company was seriously af
fected by the traction strike called
last night.
Shonts Says Strike is a Failure.
' Officials of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation of Street and Electric Railway
Employes who are conducting the
strike conceded that schedules on the
subway and elevated lines were not
seriously hampered, but reiterated
their determination to riht to the end
and announced that v.iespread ef
forts would be made to induce strike
breakers and employes who have re
mained loyal to the company to quit
their posts. Theodore . P. Shonts,
president of the Interborough, issued
a statement late today in which he
said the strike was a failure and that
if police protection continued as good
as it has been throughout the day, the
city was assured of normal transpor
tation facilities.
Several Arrests Made.
Several arrests were made during the
day, but disorders which occurred in
various parts of the city resulted in
only minor injuries to a few persons,
according to police reports. The most
serious disturbance occurred when a
crowd of strikers surrounded two
surface cars and hurled bricks and
stones. Police reserves soon dispersed
the strikers, however. In other cases
bricks were thrown from roofs upon
elevated trains and several attempts
were made to "rush" station employes
fromtheir posts.
Surface Cars Ordered to Barns.
Disruption of service on surface,
lines diverted much of this traffic to
the elevated and subway lines. Aft
er the evening rush hours the New
York Railways Company ordered most
of its surface cars to the barns, de
claring they would be taken out again .

RETURN'S FROM THE ARCTIC
With Some Members of the MacMillar
Expedition,
Battle Harbor, Labrador, Sept. 7.
The Grenfel Mission schooner George
B. Cluett, which went to the relief ol
the Donald B. MacMillan Arctic ex'
pedition in July, 1915, has returned
here. Only Captain H. C. Pickles and
the crew are aboard, MacMillan, Dr. E.
O. Hovey, who led the relief expedition,
and other scientists of the party hav
ing elected to remain for a time in
the northern part of Greenland.
The MacMillan party wintered
aboard the Cluett in Parker Snow bay,
east of Etah, and Captain Pickles re
ports that on July 29, 1916, when the
Cluett left Ntorth Star bay, Greenland.
about 20 miles north of the expedi
tions w-inter quarters, all the party
were in good health and had an abun
dance of supplies.
The MacMillan party were joined by
Knud Rasmussen, the Danish explorer,
who has been engaged in that region
in mapping out the coast, and it is
understood that they will return by
way of Denmark.
The Cluett was just able to get deal
of her anchorage through a narrow
lane of ice, and after four weeks oi
battling with heavy ice reached open
water at a point about the latitude ol
Durban harbor. 40 miles north of Capa
Dyer.
Throughout August fog and south
erly head winds prevailed.
The hull of the Cluett on her arrival
here appeared to bo in good shape, in
spite of the hard winter through which
she passed and her buffeting by the ice
on her trip south. Her engine has
been out of commission since last Oc
tober and her propeller shaft and rud
der chains are broken.
The crew seems to be in good health,
despite the shortage of food and othel
hardships through which they passed,
The winter's diet of salt horse and
bread was varied by a supply of bird!
and sea pigeons, which were netted in
large numbers, and whale, sea walrus
and polar bear meat.
