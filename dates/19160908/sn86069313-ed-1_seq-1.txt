Muny Who Had Wrong Impression
Meet Rig, Genial American With
( Pleasing Smile.
Lexington, Ky Sept. G. More
than 20,000 Kentucklans visited
Lexington to-day to meet, greet nnd
nppraiso Charles Evans Hughes, Re
publican nomlnco for President, who
opened the Stato campaign at tho
Woodlawn Park Auditorium here this
afternoon.
Tonight they are returning to their
homes, delighted and enthusiastic,
carrying with them a vivid Impres
sion of a vigorous, red-blooded Amer
ican citizen, equal In every respect
to the great task nf leadership for
which be has been chosen by his
party.
Gov. Hughes made u tremendous
Impression upon the assembled host
of Republicans, many of whom had
been led by a hostile press to expect
nn nustero, aloof personality. In
Htead, they found a big, genial, thoro
ly human American whose smile com
mands Instant liking, even as his
character and attainments compel
Instant respect.
They liked the firm handclasp with
which ho greeted them, they liked
the smile which accompaniud it, they
liked his speoctvand thoy liked, best
of all, the earnest vigor with which
liu set forth his principles. And Gov.
Hughes returned the liking in equal
measure, as ho revealed by words and
maimer during his entire stay in tho
city. In a word, Kentucky and tho
Republican nominee becamo fast
friends In Lexington todny.
Refer to Railroad Bill.
The most striking fcaturo of Gov.
Hughes' address this afternoon was
nn extended comment upon labor
problems, which was taken by his
audience as an allusion to the man
ner In which tho recent threatened
railroad strike was adjusted. The
Republican nominee condemned forc
ed "legislative action In advance of
Investigation," alluding as many
thought to tho passage of tho Adam
son bill.
"We havo a new spirit abroad in
these recent days In America," Mr.
Hughes declared. "It Is the spirit
that demands legislation In advance
of Investigation. It Is tho spirit that
demands executlvo action and con
gressional action In advance of an
examination of tho facts upon which
said action should be based. It Is
the spirit which says, 'Legislate now,
and tnvcstlgato afterwards.'
"It Is the spirit of force. It Is not
American. From tho bottom of ny
woul, I deslro fair dealing In this
country between man and man. Thero
Is no oni) more anxious than I that
thero shall bo equity In connection
with all our relations. I want to
seo our human resources conserved
by wise and Intelligent action. I
want to seo ovory particle of class
antagonism vanish In tho prcsonco
of the application of just principles.
I want to seo our men knit together
In a common fellowship. I want la
bor to havo safe moans pf work, san
itary conditions of work, wholosomo
opportunities for recreation, reason
able hours for work, fair wagos and
provision for old ago. I want what
Is reasonable for labor."

VIIiliE FOB OVEB HOUR.
II. P. Taylor and W. S. Tlnsley,
who went to Hodgenvillo as members
of tho general committee from Ohio
county to escort tho President to
the Lincoln farm, had a unique ex
perience Monday which they say was
for a time more vexing than amus
ing. Mr. and Mrs. Taylor and Mr. Tins
ley entered the memorial building,
In which only members of the pres
idential party and committeemen
were" allowed at the time. They In
spected the building and after the
President and his party had regis
tered and passed out they also reg
istered their names and prepared to
depart for tho speaking. In the
meantime the custodian of the hall
had, In his excitement, closed and
locked the doors and to their great
surprise the party found themselves
"locked up" for tho first time.
G. Earl Wilson, of Louisville,
and a man from Shelbyvllle were
fellow prisoners and tho party set
about making plans for their escape.
The building Is so constructed that
no one on the outside could be made
understand and their pleas for as
sistance were at first In vain.
After an hour and a half of futile
attempts to bring about their release,
however, a friend on tho outside,
realized the trouble and Louisville
police set tho party at liberty, much,
be It verily said, tolholr delight.

ULTIMATUM TO CHINA MIGHT
INVOLVE AMERICAN INTER
ESTS BELIEF.
WATCH DEVELOPMENTS
Clash Between Oriental Troops At
Chciigcblatun May Lend To
Serious. Trouble.
Washington, Sept. 4. Secret de
mands, In addition to those publish
ed today In dispatches from Peking,
are being pressed on China by Japan
as a result of tho recent clash of
Chinese and Japanese troops at
Chengchlatun. It became known
hero tonight U'ftt the situation la
much more perlous than has been In-
idlQftfed, confidents reports saying
the unpublished demands threaten
tho authority of China over tho
whole of Inner Mongolia.
Officials hero view the development
with real anxiety, earing another
China-Japanese crisis which might in
volve tho Intere'sts of the United
States. The Chengchlatun Incident,
trivial in itself, but coming on top
of the strained relations ever slnco
Japan took over Klaochow from
Germany, has been closely watched
since Japan hastened to send 2,000
soldiers to the disturbed district and
the cabinet announced that a satis
factory outcome depended on Chi
na. Reports from Peking show
alarm here. The prompt and unan
imous acceptance of. the new Cabinet
anounced today Is believed to havo
been a result of tho seriousness of
the Japanese and financial problems.
Japan's Demands.
Japan's demands, as published.call
for dismissal of Chinese officers In
command of the troops at the sceno
of thq trouble, withdrawal of tho
Chinese garrison, Indemnification of
the families of the Japanese killed,
and extension of Japanese police
rights to inner Mongolia. Actual
accounts of the dispute vary.
The Chinese claim It arose when
Japaneso soldiers atacked the Chi
nese garrison at Chengchlatun and
seized both the local Magistrate and
a Japanese merchant who had refus
ed to obey Instructions issued by tho
Chinese because bandits were operat
ing In the city. The Japanese con
tend the Chinese arrested the mer
chant Illegally and flred on a smalt
body of Japanese troops sent to In
vestigate. About fifty Chinese and
seventeen Japanese were killed. -
The secret domands are believed
here to seek extension to Inner Mon
golia of rights which nlready havo
been won In South Manchuria, In
both places China is forbidden under
tho treaty of May 8, 1915, to raise a
foreign loan on local taxes without
Japan's consent, and forced to con
sult Japan In case she can not raise
monoy herself for the railroads thero.
Beyond that, however, tho Japaneso
In South Manchuria havo unlimited
rights of travel, residence, trade and""
leasing of land, together with tho
- a - - ""
mines, and preference in case foreign
advisors are sought In military, po
litical, pollco or financial matters.
United States Awaits Reports.
Nouo Of the demands as published
! Infringes upon any right of the Unit-
( ed States, officials think, but a report
'on the secret negotiations will bo
awaited with concorn as thoy may
.conflict with the open door policy and
tho Integrity of China. Except for
tho possibility of American interfer
ence, it is pointed out, Japan prac
tically has a freo hand In China, as
all tho European powers aro too ful
ly occupied at homo to devote much
attention to tho Far East.
The report of secret demands re
called to diplomats the famous twen-ty-oue
demands mado upon China by
Japan on January 18, 1916, tho exis
tence of which was denied for sovor
rtl weeks, A version containing all
demands later was given out by tho
Japaneso Embassy in London, omit
ting the vital group five. On April
25, a revised list was published, and
on May 7, Japan sent a forty-eight-hour
ultimatum which was acceded
to the next day.
