Lowell Near in
Auto Accident
Lowell Near Victim of Automo
mobile Accident Last Sun
day Evening
One of the worst accidents it
lias been the duly of the editor of
this paper to chronicle occurred
last Sunday evening when Low
c-11 Near, the nine-year-old son of
Mr. and Mrs. Fred Near was
struck by an automobile driven
by Herman Geyer, and has been
in a precarious condition since.
Together with other boys of
about his own age Lowell had
been playing in the vicinity of
I be Scott livery barn on the north
side. A wagon passed leaving a
cloud of dust in its wake and as
Lowell was walking across the
road the car hit him from the
rear. When picked up he was
unconscious and although a phy
sician was called at once and ev
erything possible was done for
him he had not regained con
sciousness at the time of our go
ing to press.
Dr. Bowen was called from
Dickinson Wednesday and to
iay Lowell was taken to a Dick
inson hospital where an X-Bay
examination will be made.
The boy's many friends, as
well as those of his parents are
hoping that the injuries he re
ceived will be of such minor na
ture that his recovery will be
but a matter of a short while.

NORTH DAKOTA GETS
$500,000 PACKING PLANT
Grand Forks, Sept. 8—That the
much discussed packing plant for
North Dakota is likely soon to
become a reality is indicated by
I he fact that articles of incorpor
ation have been filed with the
Secretary of State for the North
ern Packing Company, a North
Dakota organization capitalized
for *500,000.
Those in charge of the plans
of the organization promise a bus
iness for North Dako'h which
will go ffaj* toward developing
the diversified farming, which we
so badly need, as the company
will provide a home market for
North Dakota hogs, cattle and
sheep. The plans of the company
also include the making of the
same into a very broad organiz
ation, in that it is planned to al
lot small blocks of stock to the
different sections of the state,
not permitting any individual, of
group of individuals to gain con
trol of the company. The plans
also contemplate the elimination
of the great promotional expense
which usually accompanies the
floating of large propositions.
There will be no water in the
slock of the Northern Packing
Company. It will be owned and
controlled by the eilizens of the
state. The business of the new or
ganization, as set forth in its ar
ticles, is to deal in live stock and
farm products, lo own and oper
ate cold storage plants, to own
and operate a packing house for
slaughter, dressing, curing and
storage of meats and the manu
facture of packing house pro
ducts, and to own and operate
feeding and slock yards, and to
develop a home market for North
Dakota hogs, cattle and sheep.
With a home market, time is
saved, charges for shrinkage,
yardage and feeding of animals
sent to distant markets have also
tended to eat up a goodly share
of the profits which should go to
North Dakota farmers and with
a home market these leaks can be
stopped. Then, too, many North
Dakolans are convinced that they
can do this marketing and kill
ing as well for themselves as
other states can do it for them
and the new company will expect
to pay hack dividends ils
stockholders, the handsome pro
fits which ai'j now goi ig else
where.

Board of the Northern Packing

tresen
lalivcs were present from Dick

Ihe line.
All along the line money has

ject slill runs high. In the country
west of Amidon sufficient money
has already been raised that the

extend il farther.
Baiiroads are the greatest need
of Slope county today and if the

places.
