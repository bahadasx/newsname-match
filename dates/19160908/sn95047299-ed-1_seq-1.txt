RICE CREEK TO CLAY
Contract for Construction
Has been Let to Glisson
& Hancock.
Possibly tlie most important public
work of the week thus far, was the
letting of the contract on Monday by
the board of county commissioners for
building the hard surface road from
Rice Creek to the Clay county line.
There were but two bids. One
from the Logan Concrete & Engin
eering Co. fixed the figures at $29,
644.24. The other bid was from gen
tlemen who live in the road district,
Messrs. J. W. Glisson and J. T. Han
cock,, and whose bid was $23,500.
They got the contract.
Next Saturday the board will meet
in an adjourned session to reconsid
er ths bids for the Rodman road bonds
It will be remembered that these
bonds were sold last month to a Tol
edo firm whose bid was a little better
than par. Next day word came from
the bidder that a mistake had been
made and that what had been sent in
as a premium was really intended as
a discount. Much correspondence
has passed back and forth between
Mr. Odom, attorney for the board, and
the Toledo bond buyers,,, with the re
sult that the bonds wifr be closed out
to the Toledo firm at the meeting to
morrow at the discount, which is a
little under the par value of the bonds.
This will mean that we will soon have
another important hard road under
way.

Perhaps you noticed that at the
meeting of the city council last Tues
day night Attorney J. V. Walton, who
has undertaken to collect back taxes
for the city, made a report. He
handed in $888.16 as his collections
for the month. This makes a total of
some $3,000 collected up to the pres
ent, and Mr. Walton has just gotten
fairly started.
Say, but this man Walton has some
system. He showed his plans to The
News.
For several months he has been
working like a hired man laying hi3
pipes. He hired a special room in
the Law Exchange and devoted him
self exclusively to the work. He
found there was over $58,000 in back
taxes due the city of Palatka.
This amount is composed of
amounts due from realty and personal
tax, sewer, sidewalk, paving and curb
ing special taxes.
Some pieces of property have
changed hands several times since the
tax became delinquent. But Mr. Wal
ton has a system of card indexing and
can put his little fore-finger onto any
piece of delinquent property in a sec
ond of time. He knows who to in
clude in every suit, and he is now
going to ask people to walk up to
the grainery and deposit their delin
quencies, ar.d if they don't do it p. d.
o. he is going to institute suits. Of
that PcS.OOO' due the city 'Ihe News
will be wonderfully mistaken in the
man J V, Walton if he don''., get the
big bulk of it. A suit will only add
to the expense of the delinquent, for
Walton has his plans and specifica
tions well laid.
Palatka is coming into its own mon
ey this fall, and don't you forget that.
Miss Davis Suffers Injury.
H. A. Davis received a telegram
from Fairmount college Tuesday,
where his daughter, Miss Oma is a
student, saying that in a play which
was given there Monday, in which
she was taking a prominent part,
Miss Ima fell and fractured her right
arm at the elbow. The unfortunate
injury wnne very painiui, is noi, giv
ing the doctors any uneasiness, so
they report her condition as most fa
vorable to a speedy recovery.
John Mullcr Held for Murder.
John Muller the maniac who last
week murdered his father and mother
and buried their bodies, was before
Justice J. E. Marshall on Tuesday a-id
pi'vn ;i preliminary heiriig. Or'
("'.;?,! he war held over to the grand
jury on the charge of first degree
murder; there was nothing else to be
done, though the man is an undoubted
maniac with criminal tendencies.
There is little change in his conduct
though an occasional seeming flash
of intelligence gives the impression
that he at least knows what he has
done; but that he does not realize the
awful character of his crime is ap
parent to all who have observed him.
Be Sure to Register.
Because you were registered to vote
in the primary does not necessarily
mean that you are registered to vote
in the general election next November.
The primary is a party nominating
affair. In November occurs the gen
eral election when the candidates of
all parties will be on the ticket. If
you registered two or four years ago,
'or even prior to that, well and good,
you will not be obliged to register
again. But if you are a new voter,
or have come into the county or htate
and have never been registered for a
general election, you had better do so
now provided you want to vote.
The precinct registration books in
tVio vnrinns precincts of the county
opened last Monday and will be kept
open for several weens
that vou are registered.

Thanks to the Genius of M.
P. Walsh for Spoiling a
Good Thing.
Make sure
Mr. Price Not a Member.
t the meeting for the organiza
tion of the Catts' Club in this city
some two weeks ago The News along
with the other papers of the city
stated that Mr. C.-H. Price was elect
ed treasurer of the club.
That was a statement of fact. For
at the meeting Mr. Price was named
and duly elected treasurer. It ap
pears however, that Mr. Price was not
a member of the club, and therefore
.c nnt-. eligible to hold office in it.
This he afterwards pointed out to the
club members and Mr. Poole the sec
retary was elected secretary-treasur
er. ...
When seen concerning tne matter
Mr. Price, who is the democratic nom
inee for county superintendent of
schools, said:
"No, I am not a member of, the
ctii' d.ih. and was therefore not eli
gible to hold office in it. They have
I understand elected Mr. Poole, treas
urer in my place. I attended the
meeting for organization of the club j
... f tho Atptbndist pastor !
OH 1I1V 1L.IHWI, ' .
and was present when I was nominat
ed and elected treasurer, but up to
that time no club had been formed
and I was under the impression that
I was only to fill a temporary place.
When the' Club was formed I did not
join, and have not since. I am try
ing to be perfectly neutral in this
contest. 1 shall support the Demo
cratic ticket. I have always been a
loyal democrat, and see no reison for
changing at this time."
Perhaps the one important thing
before the board of trade meeting last
Monday night was the statement of
Mr. M P. Walsh of the Florida
Farms & Homes, Inc., that he had as
sumed responsibility for the payment
of the first two assessments againt
Palatka for incorporation in the Flor
ida First Commission advertisements
now running in a number of the great
daily newspapers of the country. Mr.
Walsh stated that he had requested
the 1 nomas Advertising Service to
include Palatka in these" advertise
ments, and that he would assume re
sponsibility for the payments.
Of course he wants the board of
trade to make good and continue the
advertising of Palatka throughout the
entire series. This the board will try
to do, but it expects, and with reason,
that the city council will do its part.
Therefore a commitee was appointed
with Mr. Walsh as chairman to go
before the council and ask the city's
help. Mr. Walsh did that on Tues
day night, though up to now the coun
cil has taken no positive action.
Mr. Walsh also told of his visit to
Washington and his efforts to get
President Wilson to visit Palatka on
the occasion of the big Farmer's Con
vention in November, and the execu
tive's promise to give the matter care
ful consideration.
He also told of efforts to have a
big cattle show here on the occasion
of the convention, and for which he is
working.
It is also the purpose of the board
of trade to have a big exhibit of Put
nam county farm products on exhibi
tion here at that time corn, citrus
fruits, etc., and all farmers who have
products they are specially proud of
will he invited to exhibit.
Sheriff Kennerly 111.
Sheriff R. Lee Kennerly has been ill
and confiined to his bed for the past
ten days. His trouble is caused by
stomach disorder and for a time he
was desperately ill. Later reports in

county people will generally regret
the iilness of their popular sheriff,
and will awit news from his bedside
with hopeful interest.

D. M. Vanzant. Music was delight
fully rendered by Messrs. Prevatt,
Vanzant and Hancock, violinists; Mrs.
J. H. Faulkner, and the Misses Wini

Gone to Balltimore.
Col. W. A. MacWilliams has gone
to Baltimore on a business trip, and
while there for a brief stay he will
join Mrs. MacWilliams, his daughters,
Mrs. E. Noble Calhoun and Mrs.
Raimond Lee Hendricks and the two
little granddaughters, Gertrude Eileen
Calhoun and Mary lone Hendricks,
who went north last week. The chil
dren have been ill since their arrival
in Baltimore, following the journey
northward from Jacksonville, but good
news of their condition is expected
shortly. St. Augustine Record.
Concerning Seed Potatoes.
J. H. Millican, who has been in
Maine looking after seed potatoes, has
written an interesting letter to Com
missioner T. M. Waldron of East Pa
latka concerning the potato conditions
in Maine, and with Mr. Waldron's per
mission The News is printing the let
ter as follows:
"Ft. Fairfield, Maine, Sept. 1st.
''I guess you will be interested to
rt a line from the seed country. I
have been here about a week and have
been on the tro all the time; have been
out with car and horse and buggy
nearly every day. Spent one day at
the U. S. Agricultural Station here,
trying to find out something about the
diseases, and it is interesting, espe
cially so where one is interested in
good seed. I think I must have vis
ited at least 100 farms, and find good
crops, prosperous farmers and pota
toes bringing good prices. The far
mers are selling in bulk, that is they
haul nr.J dump in the car (coblers)
at $2.25 to $2.35 here. There are
very few Rose 4 planted here com
pared with the amount of other va
rieties planted; more coblers than any
thing else. Saw one field turning
out, or said to be turning out 160 bbls
to the acre. Would not tell you this
but G. W. Atkinson is here and will
verify it. Seed are high and going
higher and it would be well for you
to begin looking around. Wilson &
Toomer have bought 5,000 sacks of
one concern here and they look good.
There is .very little disease here but
I have recn sonic blight. Will see you
in about a week or ten days.

PALATKA SOCIALISTS
TO NAME
For Certain County Offices
List Has Been Agreed
Upon.
The socialists of Palatka have been
meeting quite frequently and discus
sing the advisiability of placing in
nomination candidates fcr county of
fices. They have also been urged by
certain parties to endorse certain oth
er candidates, but according to one
prominent socialist that party will
name no general ticket for the county,
but will content itself by naming can
didates to oppose those to whom con
sidorable opposition was manifest in
the late democratic primary ,this in the
hope that their candidate will receive
the support of the "Guardeons" and
independents :
This socialist, who is a leader in
the party in Palatka, if in fact he is
not fully one-third of it, says that the
following nominations will be made:
For County Tax Assessor, C. A. Le.
Hardy.
For Justice of the Peace, E. E.
Loomis.
For Representative in Legislature
against H. S. McKenzie, Charles
Clark. Mr. Tilghman will not be
atacked by the socialistic element.
For Teachers' Certificates.
The annual fall examination of Put
nam county teachers for both white
and colored schools is now in progress,
the white examination being under
direction of Mrs. Pickren. The fol
lowing are taking the examination for
white schools: Misses Arzenia Mil
ler, Celia Goodson, Mamie Johnson,
Mae Joiner, Eliza Williams, Julia
Hain, Myrtle Herlong, Flossie Evans,
Mrs. Frances Byrons, Mrs. M. T. Han
na, Messrs. J. C. Shearer, Joseph

AN Ol'KN LETTER TO
MR. H. F. URIE.
:
My dear Mr. Urie:
In a recent communication to a lo
cal paper you have had at least a part
ot your say concerning what you are
pleased to term "this undemocratic
contest of Mr. Knott," and in which
you saw fit to characterize me as one
of the democratic editors who would
abolish the primary and go back to
the old convention system of nomina
ting candidates, as well as by impll
cation to charge that I am also one
of the editors who "stand close to the
big corporations of our State who are
trying to wreck the primary.
You are a comparatively new com
er to Putnam county, Mr. Urie, and
therefore can be excused for not be
ing familiar with certain facts re
garding local political history.
But you have been taking yourself
seriously and 1 am disposed to hu
mor you to the extent of writing se
riously to you in reply. Not, mind
you, in the hope of changing your
views, for if I am any judge of men
your mind is so filled with prejudice
that any attempt to change it into
normal channels of thought would be
like sowing to the wind with a pos
sibility of reaping a whirlwind of
words. I think I would like you as
a man, but I never would turn to you
for advice as a statesman, or a man
versed in political economy, or one
grounded in the fundamentals of
democratic form of government like
ours.
Here are some facts:
There is but one editor in this
state who has openly advocated the
abolition of the primary. He has
been both a republican editor and a
democratic editor in Florida. At
least he has supported republican can
didates and democratic candidates,
and is now supporting Mr. Catts. We
refer to the Florida Metropolis pub
lished in Jacksonville, and whose edi
tor is Mr. W. R. Carter.
The Palatka News has within the
weak or two canea eaitonai attention
to the fact that Carter's denunciation
of the primary has been met with
universal derision on the part of the
other editors of Florida.
The Primary was adopted by the
democracy of Florida in 1900, the
year of the last State Democratic
Convention. I was a menmer oi mat
convention and was also a member
of the Committee on Platform and
Resolutions which met in the old
Jacksonville board of trade rooms and
drafted the platform and original pri
mary svstem. 1 have always advo
cated the primary, and regard any at
tempts now being made to upset it as
puerile. The primary system may
not be perfect, but as a system for
making party nominations it has come
to stay. The power has been placed
in the hands ot the people wnere it
of right belongs, and once such pow
er has been given IT CANNOT BE
WITHDRAWN. I am proud of the
work I had, both in securing the adop
tion of the onirinal primary system
bv the democracy of Florida, and of
the place 1 was subsequently to nave
in helping to enact tnat system into
the law of the State.
The present law is cumbersome, but
at the time of its enactment it was
considered a great improvement over
the old two primary svstem, as well
as a great saving in expense to the
State. The present law is a modifi
cation of Senator Lafollette's draft
and is said to b e in use in his own
state of Wisconsin as well as in many
other States. If there is a change,
I hope to s e e the law so simpli
fied that a wayfaring man, though de
ficient mentally, need not err in mark
ing his ballot or in counting and tab
ulatig it.
The Palatka News has never been
lined up with corporations, but has al
ways been classed as among the pro
gressive papers of Florida's democ
racy has been identified with that
wing of the party. Perhaps that is
why it now comes to the defense of
our high courts, whose integrity you
have assailed. Heretofore the high
courts have never been assaihd ex
cept by anarchists. It is a branch
of constitutional government which
has, with a few possible exceptions,.
stood as a bulwark against .ninstice
and oppression of the people. To as
sail the integrity of our courts would
not be progress. It would be a step
backward, toward anarchy, and I am
one Florida editor who is not prepared
to take it. Rather I stand for the
rule of the people under the constitu
tion and law as interpreted by our
high courts of justice. And I get my
groundwork of democracy from such
patriots as Thomas Jefferson and Al
exander IT. Stevens and G rover Cleve
land and William Jennings Bryan and
Woodrow Wilson and nnt from Tom
Watson and Nelson A. Miles and Sid
ney J. Catts.
I entered the late primary with an
open mind in so far as the candidates
for povernor were concerned. The
first candidate I heard for that high ' have that nomination. The courts do
office was Sidney J. Catts, in his ini- not make nominations, but when there
tial address in Palatka. That address is a contest among candidates and a
was so filled with half-truths, misrep- question as to whom the people real
rcson'ations and false democratic doc- ! Iy selected, it is the court under our
Tuesday's Fire Alarm.
The alarm of fire about noon on
Tuesday was occasioned by a small
blaze out on Olive street in a small
house; the boys acted promptly as
usual and little damage resulted.
"One thing the city council ought
to do ," said P. M. Hagan in speaking
of the race to this fire to a number
of gentlemen the other evening, "is
to enact an ordinance to require ev
ery vehicle on the street to come to a
full stop near the curb the moment
the fire alarm is sounded. When this
lire occurred yesterday automobiles
were seen racing up the street some
of them actually trying to beat the
fire truck. This should not be allow
ed, and if continued will sometime re
sult in a bad accident. Then, too. it
makes it hard for the driver of the
ire truck to be always on the lookout
fv motors en the street and at cross
ings, lie should have a clean path.
With such r.n ordinance in force it is
ljbtful if in case of accident that
laities to it would have ground to
;ue the city for damages. Such an
trdi"ance is in force in Jacksonville,
and when the alarm is sounded very
vehicle on the streets to be passed
ever by the engine, comes to a dead
stop. Most always here the engine
goes out Lemon street."
pose to promote the interests of
a foreign power, in disregard of
our own country's welfare or to
injure this government in its for
eign relations or cripple its in
dustries at home, and whoever BY
AROUSING PREJUDICES OF
A RACIAL, RELIGIOUS OR
OTHER NATURE, CREATES
DISCORD AND STRIFE
AMONG OUR PEOPLE SO AS
TO OBSTRUCT THE WHOLE
SOME PROCESS OF UNIFICA
TION, IS FAITHLESS TO THE
TRUST WHICH THE PRIVI
LEGES OF CITIZENSHIP RE
POSE IN HIM AND DISLOYAL
TO HIS COUNTRY."
Mr. Catts preached this doctrine of
discord and strife in an attempt to
arouse prejudices of a religious na
ture.
But this letter is getting too long,
Mr. Urie. I want to say in conclu
sion that as a member of the State
Democratic Committee from Putnam
county I shall endeavor to do my ut
most to keep the party in Florida in
full harmony with democratic doctrine
as laid down by the great men who
have been its teachers and lawgivers
and to the united wisdom of present
day democracy as enunciated by our
conventions and embodied in our plat
forms. As to the present contest, I am
waiting until the testimony is all in
and the court has decided, not whom
it thinks best fitted for the nomina
tion, but whom the people themselves,
as expressed in the recent primary,
decided by a majority vote should
trine that I did not take long in elim
mating him from my list of availa
bles. In this speech Mr. Catts played up
on the prejudices of his hearers and
was absolutely untruthful in many of
his charges.
Then again, Mr. Catts was undemo
cratic; he advocated certain things
which the democratic party has al
ways condemned; certain things which
the last Convention of the party in
St. Louis aeain roundly condemned
in the following language:
"Whoever, actuated .by the nur-
democratic form of government which
must DECIDE WHOM THE PEOPLE
DID REALLY SELECT. After that
decision is made, it is expected that all
honest democrats will abide by it. If
so be that Mr. Catts is decided to be
