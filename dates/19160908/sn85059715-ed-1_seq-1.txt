WASHINGTON, Sept. 8?Congress
idjourned sine die this morning at
10 o'clock, concluding a session rec
jrd-breaklng in many respects witn
impropriations and authorizations to
wards the future running well to
ward two billion dollars.
Only a smal portion of the mem
bers were on hand to watch the ses
sion die. Most had hurried to their
homes at the end of the late session
last night, or even days before and a
month after the political campaign is
finished in November they must re
turn to for the short session.
Last night both houses accepted
the conference report on the emer
gency revenue bill without record
vote and the Senate, before recessing
in hour after midnight, ratified the
Danish West Indies purchase treaty.
The general deficiency appropriation
bill also was approved as reported
by conf rence.
Today's session was necessitated
nnly by need for time to reprint, the
measure in the proper form to be
signed. Conferees reached an agree
ment on the bill in the evening after
spending two days on it.
The Senate began its session at 8
n. m.. following an adjournment at
1 a. ra. upon passage of the emer
gency Tevenue bill. At the outset.
Senator James Hamilton Lewis
sought to have passed the Spanish
war widows' pension bill. Senator
Hoke Smith, of Georgia, announced
that such a measure could not pass
for several years if he could prevent
it.
Senator Owen then addressed tho
Senate on his corrupt practires bill.
Senator Owen announced that he
would not further press his corrupt
practices bill at this session but
would let it remain the unfinished
business before that body and call it
up again next session.
A resolution by Senator Curtis, of
Kansas, directing the Senate lobby
committee to investigate the activ
ities of allleged foreign lobbies, op
posing retaliatory provision of the
revenue bill against Canadian fish
eries, was passed today by the Sen
ite.
Soon after 9 o'clock President Wil
son went to the eopitol to sign bills.
The president held a reception in
his room as a line of senators and
representatives passed tbrough as he
sat at the table signing bills.
As the president was about to sign
the widows* pension bill with Repre
sentative Ash brook, of Ohio, its spon
sor. by his sidp. Senators Smith, of
Seorgla, and Bryan, of Florida, who
Dpposed it vigorously until the last
minute, entered the president's room
*nd Mr. Ashbrook asked them to wit
ness the signature. The president
smiled as the two senators hurried
a. way.
The president congratulated the
ieaderB on an opportunity for a
"well-earned" rest. Officially ho in
formed them that he had nothing
further to communicate to the Con
gress. When they left the presi
dent's room, the chief executive was
joined by Secretary Lansing, who
chatted with him as he continued to
slen bills.
Senators Kern and Smoot and Rep
resentatives jKitchin. Fitzgerald and
Mann were the committees to notify
the president that Congress was
about to adjourn. The president,
having nothing to communicate
to either body and the com
mittee so adjourned, the Senate ad
journed at 9:50 o'clock and tho
House one minute later.
Congress at th" session closed Fri
day appropriated exactly $1,626.
439,210, which, with obligations and
authorizations for the future, makes
the total $1,858,384,485.
The figures announced In speeches
by Representatives Fitzgerald, of
New York. Democrat, and Gillette,
of Massachusetts, Republican, were
defended by the former and attacked
by the latter as half a billion dollars
irreater than any session of a Repub
lican Congress.
In a statement issued following the
adjournment of Congress. President
Wilson called attention to the "help
ful and humane legislation" passed
and declared that while he regretted
additional legislation dealing with
the recent dispute between the rail
roads and their employes had not
been completed he had every reason
to believe the question would bo tak
en up immediately after Congress re
assembles. ,
