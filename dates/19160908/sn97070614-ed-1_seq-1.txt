State Grange closed its session here
tli is afternoon, niter the adoption of
several resolutions and the transaction
of routine business. 4
The feature of the closing session
was a discussion of the home rule
amendment which is to go before the
people tins fall, initiated by what is
known as the Good Government
league, of which A. I). Kd wards, of
Atlantic Mine, a member of the legis
lature, is president. It was asserted
by some of tlie members that Mr. Ed
wards, in letters and in advertising,
has signed himself a "lember of the
State Grange." While they admit his
membership, the grangers insist that
such representation might lead people
to believe that the grange is in favor
of tlie home rule amendment, whereas
it is not.
To .explain this the following reso
lution was unanimously adopted:
"Whereas, Tin? president of an or

PREDICTION FOR
HUGHES BASED ON
1911 ELECTIONS
IF COUNTRY VOTES FOR PRES
IDENT AS IT DID FOR CON
GRESS THEN HUGHES' ELEC
TION IS CERTAIN.
Washington, Sept. 2. The Republi
can Publicity association through its
presideut, Hon. Jonathan Bourne, Jr.,
today gave out the following state
ment at its Washington headquarters::
"If the country votes at the Presi
dential election this vear as it voted at
the congressional election of 1914,
Hughes will carry California. Colorado,
Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois,
Iowa, Massachusetts. Michigan, Min
nrsota. Nevada, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North
Dakota. Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont,
Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin
and Wyoming.
"These states have 286 votes in the
electoral college, a majority of which
is only 260.
"in each of these states, two years
ago, the Republican congressional tick
et received a clear plurality of votes.
In these states combined the Republi
can candidates for congress received
4,075,157 votes, while the Democratic
candidates for congress received only
3,132.563 votes the total Republican
plurality being 942,589.
ORGANIZED PROGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN
"In each of these states, in 1914, there
was an organized Progressive campaign
except in Nevada. North Dakota,
Utah and Wisconsin, although in Utah
there was a Fusion ticket running in
oppoeion to the Republicans. The
total Progressive vote in these states
was 746,341; and the combined Repub-Iican-Pr6gres8ive
plurality over the
Democrats was 1,688,930.
"Two yenrs ago there were five
states Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Ne
braeka and Ohio which are fairly to
be classed as normally Republican but
where the Democratic congressional
ticket received a plurality of . votes
ranging from a beggarly 365 in Maine
to an Impressive 42,752 in Indiana.
But the Progressive vote in each of
these five states was far in excess of
the difference between the Republican
and Democratic totals, and ranged
from 3,111 in Nebraska to 90,040 in
Indiana. In Kansas the Progressive
vote in 1914 amounted to 74,441; in
Ohio it was 47,931; and in Maine it
was 17 985.
"These five states will cast 63 votes
in the electoral college. How will they
vote this year?
"Hopeful Democratic statisticians
estimate the division of the former
Progressive vote upon different pro
portions in each instance, however,
giving the long end of it to the Repub
licans and in no instance claiming that
more than 90 per cent of the Bull Mooee
will support Wilson. Upon this ex
treme hypothesis, let us examine the
vote of tie five states where a Demo
cratic plurality was found in the con
gressional elections of 1914.
THE VOTE IN INDIANA.
"The Republican vote of Indiana in
1914 was 233,140, the Progressives cast
ing 00,040 and the Democrats 273,892.
Dividing the Bull Moose strength on
the basis of 70 and 30 per cent, respec
tively, to the Republicans and the
Democrats, the vote of Indiana this
year should be: Republican, 296,162;
Democratic, 302,904. The margin is
too small for comfort on either side;
and Indiana must remain as fighting
territory; until the votes are counted.
The Progressives aided, it is said, by
Democratic funds are maintaining an
organization in that state: but compe
tent observers believe that from 83 to
90 per cent ot the Moose will vote for
Hughes and that the number who will
support Wilson are negligible. Upon
this basis, Iodiaga should go for Hughes
and Fairbanks by nearly 30,000.
"The 70 30 division applied to Kan
sas would give, that state to the Re
publicans by the following figures:
Republican, 240,215; Democratic, 218.
162. "In Maine the result would be: Re
publican, 72,883; Democratic, 66,071.
"In Nebraska the figures would show:
Republican, 113,376; Democratic, 113,
820. This is another hair-line of dem
onstrationbut there is no Bull Moose
ticket in Nebraska this year; and while
the contest will be a hard one. the
Indications are that Hughes will carry
the state.
"The same division of the Progres
sive vote in Ohio, would produce fig
ures for 1916 in this wise: Republican?,
511,183; Democratic, 498,053.
It is, therefore, a fair assumption
