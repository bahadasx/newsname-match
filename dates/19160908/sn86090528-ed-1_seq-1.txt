BEN BROOKS
GRAVELY
INJURED
Receives Probably Fatal Blow When
Struck by Automobile and Thrown
to Paving
ACCIDENT DECLARED
TO BE UNAVOIDABLE
Victim Was Crossing Fourth Street With
Umbrella Turned to North Between
Him and Approaching Car
What might prove to bo another fa
tal automobile accident occurred at 10
o'clock last night during the heavy
rains which, in. the opinion of the traf
fic officer who witnessed it, was una-
r
voidable under the circumstances.
Ben S. Brooks, the veteran-bill poster
and well known in Chickasha, now lies
in the Chickasha hospital hovering be
tween life and death with a scalp
wound and a shock to hia nervous sys
tem from which he may not recover.
From those who saw the accident
it appears that Mr. Brooks, who had
been in attendance at a performance
at the Kozy theater, had left his fam
ly at that show while he went to the
corner of Fourth and Kansas for hia
buggy and an umbrella which had been
left there. He had reached his buggy,
which was on the west side of Fourth
street, and apparently deciding to wa't
in the Ford garage until the rain slack
ened, opened the umbrella and turning
it so as to Bhiold his body from the
slanting deluge from the north, hur
riedly started across Fourth street. As
he did so he was struck by an automo
bile coming south on Fourth street,
which he evidently neither saw nor
heard owing to the position of his um
brella. Two other cars lined up on I
Fourth street intercepted the vision of
both the driver of the car, Dr. L. E.
Emanuel, and his victim and before
warning could be given the pedestrian
was thrown violently to the ground,
striking his head on the hard paving
with such force as to cause a probably
fatal injury.
Later the waiting members of his
family at the Kozy were notified of the
sad occurrence and were driven to the
hospital to remain, at the bedside dur
ing his long hours of unconsciousness.
Sammy Dwyer's Statement.
In the opinion, of Sammy Dwyer, mo
torcycle cop, who witnessed the whole
affair, the accident was unavoiUaiiio.
In an interview with a representative
of the Chickasha Dally Express today
he said:
"I was standing in front of the door
of Boone and Rickerts' garage and saw
the car leave the Sugg theater and
atari south on Fourth street. The man
in the street, whom I did not know at
the time, was half way between Kan
sas avenue and the Sugg when he
started across the street to the cast.
There were two cars lined up on that
side of the street between him and the
theater. Mr. Brooks, for he It proved
to be. had an umbrella and was hold
ing it so as to protect his head and
face from the rain which was beating
down on the umbrella from the north,
the same direction In which the car
was coming. Both the car and Brooks
were in the center of the street when
. n,nn was struck. I do not believe
that Dr. Emanuel's speed exceeded ten
miles an hour if it reached that, as he
had just left the theater and could not

the Russians, the capture of Goritz bv
the Italians, the shallow thrust into the
German lines In the Sommo region
and the occupation of some moutain-
ous territory by the Roumanians, these
constituting all their positive military
achievements.
Keeping their lines Intact every
where, it is pointed out by the experts,
tlie armies of the Central Powers at
the same time have struck back with
successful blows in the Balkans. The
Bulgars have advunced oil both flanks,
menacing the allies iii Greece and the
Bulgars and Germans have struck a
severe blow against the Roumanians
by occupying Tutrakan, one of the po
sitions defending Bucharest.
The combined allied - losses during
the period mentioned is conservatively
estimated! here as follows: Russians
600,000, British 230,000, French 2.10,

ians combined 50,000.

To be shot in the arm by unknown
parties is bad enough but to have add
ed to this the indignity of being arrest
ed as a drunk is the limit in the esti
mation of Kustace KdwarUs, an Indian,
who passed through these experiences
during last night's heavy rain. Ed
wards was too drunk to know when
had happened but Officers Baird, LT
ton ond Dwyer placed him under ar
rest for drunkenness after hearing a
shot fired in the vicinity ot Fourth and
Kansas avenue.
The Indian had his wound dressed
by Dr. A11U0 before being taken to Jail
and this morning the doctor called to
look after his patient. The prisoner
was then released on a $10 bond.- He
says be remembers nothing of the oc
currence. Officers are investigating.
