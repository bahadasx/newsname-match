itself over the wide lawn in front
of the court house wore people
from every part of the county
men women and children all
gathered to assist in the dedica

success The students of the
Gila Academy were the livest
bunchof young America that
has been seen in the county seat
for many years and they were
the life of the parade
The Safford Volunteer Fire De-
partment was out in full uniform
with their new fire truck The
Fire Laddies certainly were a
representative element of the
heroic spirit of our time
The Womans Club was an
other organization that drew
forth the cheers and happ cont
inent of the multitude on the line
of march The ladies were
dressed in white and carried rd
white and blue umbrellas mak
ing a most pleasing sight to the
eye Twelve little girjs dressed
in -white carried the beautiful
flag which theclub had donated
for the new county court house
It was truly patriotic and a happy
part of the parade
The Layton Relief Society each
member wearinga beautifulbadge
and carrying a small flag the
Safford Chamber of Commerce
the Common Councils of Pima
Thatcher and Safford the Camp
Fire Girls the Boy Scouts and a
squad from Company B made
up the enthusiastic line of march
ers that passed between the
decorated buildings of the busiest

by President Andrew
He said in part
Historical
Graham county at the most is
but a baby county possibly a
little over forty years -of age as
an organized county less but
the natural resources were here
conditions were favorablevfor the
making of a great and prosperous
county
Early Settlement
I E Solomon came down from
Clifton and found good timber
for burning charcoal for the
mining industry His force of
Mexican employes increased his
commissary grew to be a store
He tried the soil and it produced
to his satisfaction He began the
cultivation of the earth Five
Mormon families from Apache
county composed of the Weechs
Teeples Rogers and others were
organized by President Jesse N
Smith at SnoWflake and started
of inquest of a new world to
settle and as they crossed the
mountains found the promised
laud There were already some
ranchers and rustlers in the
country The Apache Indians
were no scource of comfort to
the settlers Later such men as
WmD Johnson President Chris
topher -Layton Hon George A
Olney and many others followed
as the county developed
County Formation
In due course of time the leg
islature formed a new county
composed ot the southeast portion
of the State known as Graham
county Later the eastern por
tion composed of Clifton Morenci
andMetcalf and the upper Gila
with Duncan Franklin and the
farming country on up to the
border of New Mexico were taken
from the original and made Green
lee county this left Graham with
but the agricultural portion witn
her splendid resources and quiet

with the bootleggers and riot
only winking at the -violation of
the law but seems to be associ
ated with the liquor interests
-Mr Slaughter who is seeking
the nomination for sheriff on the

Wall Street and Edinburg Scot
land
The comps on The Guardian
whovere present werelticklecL
to death when
evijpaper ih the State was
owned by Wall Street for this
meant that the Ghost would

The governor then went on to
toll some horrid things about the
corporations and the mine tax
bill the one Dr Bacon intro i
duced bukforget to tell the peo v
pie that hchadstood for the first
special mine tax bill in the First
Legislature and had written a
message urging its passage Per-
haps the mine superintendents
had not seen the governor before
he wrote hi3 infamous messasre
so perhaps it wasBctter the
governor said hothinglibbut that
fifsfmine tax bill that he favored
The goyerhov then stated that
the mining companies were first
paying pnlyyljier cent of -the
vtiuv viivujut iiwiLv vaashf vw
who wer6n5aying 62J cents per
acre at that time were now pay
ing on the same land 212 per
acre which is the truth
The governor told of the plans
to work convict labor on the
boulevarde bctvyeen Solomonville
ating himself with and Using land Clifton and the contemplated
such depraved beings to advocate
his candidacy

He gave a description of his

and what he had done to help i
the miners win the strike That
he went to Clifton and refused
an invitation to dine with Mr
Carmichael whom he called Lord
Carbuncle and eyerybody
laughed it was 30 funny
Then he told of meeting the
miners and tellingthem he would
put them in- the bull pen
which was also Very funny and
everybody laughed even Mc
Gowan and Dfal and this was
going some at that
The big thing of all was the
story of the governors confer
ence with the State Federation
of Labor at Tucson and that he
knew nothing of his friend
I -Mother Jones who was stump
ing the State in his behalf and
insulting every woman in the
State by her vile language
Hewaid he knew nothingbout
Mother Jones until he read it
in the Arizona Gazette Funny
isntit when she is working so
hardfor him The double cross
will be due for the old lady after

The governor closed his speech
by beseeching the ladies and

Hunt Is the Tool of ThoseWh

Would Nullify the Prohibi 9
tion Amendment -
The closing week of the cam
paign for the nomination of can
didates for State and county of
fices finds the friends of George
A Olney candidate for governor
of the State in high spiritsover
the prospects of his success
While a campaign of misrepre
sentation has been vigorously
prosecuted against him not a
single reason has been presented
why he should not receive the
nomination And on the other
hand there has been no valid
excuse offered why his opponent
should be nominated
Summing up the case Olney
seeks the nomination for a first
term Hunt asks the voters to
elect him for a fourth term
While the question of atoine
fax law is not an issue in the
present campaign the record
clearly proves that Mr Olney is-
now and always has been opposed
to special laws of any sort and
that Hunt not only voted once
in the legislature for a special
mine tax law but in a message
to the First State Legislature
urged the passage of such a law
Mr Olneys platform favors
equal rights for all citizens and
and special privileges for none
Hunts policy has been damn
the corporations and special
favors for the Moyers De Laras
and Mother Joneses ml
Economy in administration of
State government is theiwatch
wordqf Mr Olney Hunts policy
has been extravagance to the
limit and he is still asking for
more commissions and offices
where more money can be spent
