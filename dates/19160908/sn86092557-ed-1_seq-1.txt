Republican Candidate Enthusiastically
Greeted
In New England
PORTLAND. Me.. Sept. 8.?Charles
E. Hughes told a New England audience
last night that he would rather
stand for the principle of reason In legislation
and go down to defeat than to
yield "one Jet or tittle" of It and become
President of the United States.
Before five crowded audiences In
Massachusetts. New Hampshire and
Maine the nominee assailed the administration
vigorously for the enactment
of the Adamson eight-hour law.
He called It "not an eight-hour law,
but a wage-law." and said that'It was
passed "confessedly In ignorance of
the facts," and asserted that while It
had been said in its favor that society
favored the eight-hour day, society had
nothing to do with, the measure and,
Joe tared emphatically, that ''that kind
of virus in our life" would bring the
nation to disaster In the end.
Mr. Hughes was greeted In Portland
by an old-fashioned torchlight parade,
with red-fire, and faced an audience
In the city hall auditorium from which
so many were turned away that an
overflow meeting of several thousand
was formed outside.
He spoke from the platform where
Raymond Robins, chairman of the Progressive
National convention at Chicago,
had Just told the audience why
he was no longer a Democrat or a
Progressive, and whv It A snnnnrl Orl
the Republican ticket. Previously, the
nominee bad spoken at Beverly, Mass.,
Hampton Beach '.nd Portsmouth, N.
H.. and York Harbor, Maine. In each
address he assailed the administration
for the enactment of the Adamson
law.
"It Is because I am so sollcltious,*'
he told an audience in the town house
yard at York Harbor, "with respect
to the progress to be made In Industrial
co-operation and advancement of
labor that I deeply deplore In the
name of labor. In the name of justice.
In the name of American Ideals, the
surrender of the executive and congress
to force, Instead of permitting
reason to reign."
In bis Portland speech Mr. Hughes
reiterated his stand on the tariff efficiency
of government, the merit system,
protection of American rights
and other Issues of the campaign.
Before the nominee spoke, Mr. RobIns
addressed the crowd.
"I have no apologies to make for
having been a Democrat or a Progressive,"
he said. "One reason why I
am no longer a Democrat and do not
Intend to go back to the Democratic
party Is because I know the Democratic
party too well."
Mr. Robins said that he was born In
the south and added:
"The economic and social Issues
which confront the country cannot
be entrusted to a party that Is under
southern control. There are good men
and women In the south but southern
life has not kept step with our western
and northern life."

boots on!"
Tbls was the uncanny prediction
made by Dwlgbt P. Dtlworth, attorney,
to his wife, a short time ago, when |
tbey, were discussing t^he strange series
of murders that have nearly wiped
out the whole Dilworth family!
And today, as thetystery of Dwight
P. Dilworth's murder in a gloomy corner
of . New York's "Lover's Lane"
grows deeper, friends are recalling
the-odd prediction and weird fulfillment!
Dilworth was the fifth member of
.the family to be 'murdered and now
there are only two .survivors of the
family, Dllworth's little son and a
. brother of TMHebrth, who is a minister.
Friends of the latest victim of
death by violence are wondering If the
same hoodoo hovers over these two
Riirvivnr? .
"It was the fighting jaw of the Dil'
worth's that did It again! That neversay-die
chin has caused another murder
and made another Dllworth widow!"
said one or the lawyer's brother
Masons.
Oyer In New Tork the baffled poI
lice are seeking some deep motive,that
will clear up the mystery beside the
halted motor In which he had taken
pretty MIbs MafyMcNlff for a ride.
Under the arching trees of the lonely
New York parkway where the murder
took place there have been operating
what the police call the "Lover's
- Lane blackmail bandits!"
> But the efforts of the New York poUderto
link up the'Dllworth murder
fwith this gang that has been preying
\on park spooners are discounted in
Wootclalr. Dllworth'a home.
According to his neighbor- H. K.
Duff. Dllworth .^nd his wife formed
wjth their three-year-old son an ideally
hippy family. Mrs. Dllworth went
about a month ago to visit her family
fn Kansas City. Dllworth'a relations
