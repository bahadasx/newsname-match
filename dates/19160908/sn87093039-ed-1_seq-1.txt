fFDERAI FARM LOAN
BANK FOR SPOKANE
J. B. Adams Appeared Before the Fed
eral Board at the Spokane
Meeting Monday
The Federal Farm Loan Board, com
posed of G. W. Norris, Herbert Quick.
Chas. E. Lobdell and W. S. A. Smith.
met in Spokane Monday for the pur
pose of taking testimony as to condi
tions in the northwest, the value of
lands, the grouping of states in districts
and the most desirable location for a
district bank. Representatives from
every industry and interest in Washing
ton, Oregon, Idaho and Montana were
present and the interest was strong and
gripping. From the testimony it ap
pears that the four states named above
would form the most compact and
logical district, tho Wyoming and Cali
fornia were mentioned under another
grouping, but did not meet with favor
from the greater number of those
present. Spokane was favored by rep
resentatives from Idaho and Montana
as the most centrally located and ac
cessible. Portland, Oregon is also a
candidate for the farm bank location.
Seattle representatives favored Spokane,
and it is thot propable that she will
land the plum.
Farmers, fruitgrowers, bankers, finan
cier, college presidents, indeed every
interest was represented and the hearing
covered a wide range of subjects and
indmtries. Chelan, Douglas, Grant
and Okanogan counties were represent
ed. On invitation of the Spokane
Chamber of Commerce, Mr. J. B.
Adams, president and general manager
of the Skookura Packers Association
was.present and testified in regard to
fruit land valuations in the northwest
and the general condition and wants
of the fruitgrowers. His testimony was
regarded as interesting and valuable to
the board in the solution of the ques
tions under consideration. A meeting
of the Skookum Applegrowers Associa
tion called for Monday was adjourned
to a later date in order to make it pos
sible for Mr. Adams to be present at
the Farm Loan Bank hearing.
SCHOOL NOTES
Something which will add greatly to
the interest in the High school classes
will be the subscription to The Inde
pendent, Literary Digest, The Vogue,
Needlecraft, and American Cookery.
Much interest is being taken in the
school work by the pupils. The atten
dance is increasing daily. Alma Prouty
Gilbert Reeyes, Ernest Potter, Clifford
Hagler, Merritt Hagler, Ellen Arbo
gast, Will Harding and Charles Arbo
gast enrolled this week.
General Science is being given this
year as a 9th grade sbuject instead of
Physical Geography. The new texts
by Caldwell & Eikenberry are interest
ing and instructive.
The texts in Ancient and Modern
History by West, which arrived the
other day are considered a great im
provement over Meyer's.
The boys of the High school are
busy making out working drawings and
estimates of the cost of the first semes
ter's work in manual training and
mechanical drawing.
9,421 Cars fruit from the We
natchee Valley
From C. W. Ludwig, fruit inspector
who is stationed in the upper valley
and visited Leavenworth yesterday, we
learned that the fruit crop of this valley
has been estimated at the above figures
for the year 1916, by T. O. Morrison,
of the Washington state horticultural de
partment. This consists of 7,957 cars
of applet, 331 cars of peaches, 343
cars of pears and 90 cars of prunes.
The crop is almost double that of last
year. The estimate for the entire ap
ple crop of the state is 16,659 cars.
A pulpmill site is being sought in
Dorth central Washington.

W. J. HOY & CO. SNOW SHED
CONTRACTORS RESUME WORK
Notified Men Last Saturday that the Con
struction Work Would be
Resumed Monday
When the railroad strike was immi
nent last week the employes of W. J.
Hoy & Co. who have the contract to
build the snow sheds between Leaven
worth and the summit of the Cascade
mountains notified their employes,
between three and four hundred men,
that owing to the inability to get
material and the unsettled condition
on the railroad work would be suspend
ed pending the settlement of the
trouble between the railroad and its
men. On Saturday when a settlement
of the trouble by the passage on the
Dart of the congress of the United
States of what is known as the Adam
son bill and the willingness of the four
brotherhoods to accept the bill as a
settlement of the trouble was flashed
across the wires, the Hoy company im
mediately notified all the men who were
waiting for transportation that they
would resume work Monday morning.
Only a few of the men refused to
return to work. Only Friday and
Saturday was lost by the employe's thru
the prompt action of the company.
Government Works With fruit
growers
As a representative from the North
Central Washington Growers League,
composed of the counties of Chelan,
Douglas, Grant and Okanogan. Mr.
J. B. Adams attended a meeting of the
fruit growers of the four states of Wash
ington, Idaho, Oregon and Montana,
held at Walla Walla last Saturday.
Representatives of the federal govern
ment, department of agencies, were
present and discussed the marketing
end of the fruit business in a helpful
way. It is Mr. Adams' belief that the
aid given by the Agricultural depart
ment of the government will help much
in solving many of the troubles of the
troubles of the fruit grower. The co
operation between the government
agents and ihe fruit growers was most
cordial.
Kenyon Not to Be Deputy Sheriff

The Higher Up the Valley You Go the Bigger and Better the Apples Grow
Leavenworth, Wash., Friday, September 8, 1916
The Man Who Would Give Business a Chance
The Echo's Last Word on the
Judgship
Some men strain at a gnat and swal
low a camel at a gulp. Just watch
some of those who oppose Judge Grim
shaw for re-election on the ground
that he has held the office eight years.
Did you ever hear one of them com
plain at the law under which all federal
judges are appointed for life? Do
they oppose C. W. Clawson, republi
candidate for state auditor, who has
served twelve years and is asking the
people to give him four years more of
tenure? He has made a most excel
lent officer. He is capable; he is hon
est, and that is of more importance
than anything else.
The argument used by some of those
opposed to Judge Grimshaw that he
has held his office two terms, and that
is long enough, is unsound. Suppose
there was only one man opposed to
him and he was notoriously unfit, then
according to the reasoning of these
sophistical gentlemen the notoriously
unfit should be supported by the vot
ers because the fit man has held the
office long enough, and a change
ought to be made.
Then, again, to reply to those who
urge that a change is necessary on the
ground that bad feeling has grown out
of the judgship fight. Is Judge Grim
shaw to be made the victim of some
thing with which he had nothing to do.
Did he assail any of the lawyers? Has
he urged the urjfltness of any one op
posed to him? Has he said or done
anything from which one would con
clude he harbored any ill feeling against
his most strenuous and bitter opponent?
Three most excellent citizens, over a
signed statement urge Mr. Grimshaw
to return to the practice of law because
those who have so strenuously opposed
him could not practice law in his court.
By the same token we ask these gen
tlemen how could Mr. Grimshaw be
expected to practice law successfully
before a judge who is now opposing
him for re-election? If the argument
is sound it should apply to each with
equal force. The crux of the whole
judicial question may be summed up
in a few words. Is Judge Grimshaw
honest? Is he impartial in his rulings?
Is he capable? Answer either of these
questions in the negative and you are
on logical ground in your opposition.
Unsound, illogical argument does not
appeal to fairminded men and will not
defeat his re-election.
Will Little, the Inland Meat Co.
manager, was in the upper valley this

Automobile ford Wants Million
Dollar Damages
Thru his attorneys Henry Ford, the
great automobile manufacturer, has
brought suit against the Chicago Trib
une for one million dollars damage to
his reputation. The Tribune last June
called him an ignorant, deluded human
being, and over the head of an editorial
in which the language was used refer
red to him as an "anarchist enemy to
the nation which protects him in his
wealth."
Sugar 75 Cents Lower
On Wednesday the sugar trust low
ered the price of sugar 75 cents per
hundred and the whole country is now
wondering who the sugar trust is trying
to freeze out. It cannot be the Mor

in the beet sugar industry. It is up
to Senator Smoot to smoke the truth
from the trust.

—From Mr. Hughes' speech at
I Chicago.
"WORDS, OR DEEDS?"
"If anything in this campaign
la real it is that we are now
facing the question whether we
want words or whether we want
deeds; whether we want that
which Is written and spoken, or
whether we want American ac
tion in the interests of the Amer
ican people, worthy of the Amer
ican name, maintaining the
American honor, and buttressing
the prosperity of the United
States."—From Mr. Hughes'
speech at Chicago.
$75,000 WORTH Of LAMBS
GOING TO GHICAGO MARKET
Ten Thousand Lambs Will Be Loaded at
Chiwaukum Sept. 15th—57.50 per
Head, Highest Price Ever Paid
From Wm. Churchill, a veteran flock
master who has grazed sheep in the
Wenatchee national forest for many
years, we got the interesting story that
on Sept. IS the biggest shipment of
lambs ever made from this state will
leave here over the Great Northern.
What is still more interesting is the
fact that the price paid for the lambs is
the highest ever known, $7.50 per
head. Seventy-five thousand dollars
will be involved in the shipment.
Wm. Churchill will contribute 1,000
head to the shipment; Mrs. Vessey,
3,500; Mr. O. Yeats, 1,000; Ed. Mudd,
3,500; and Mr, St. Clair, 1.000, or
ten thousand in the whole deal. All
the sheep will be assembled at Chi
wa»kum,ten miles west of Leavenworth,
and started for Chicago from that point.
Mr. Churchill will load at Tye and ship
to Cniwaukum by rail. All the other
flockmasters will drive their lambs to
the loading point from their respective
range allotments in the Wenatchee
national forest, which is practically the
entire western part of Chelan county.

The independant Warehouse Co., which
is owned and managed by F. A. Win

in shape to receive fruit as it comes in.
These two gentlemen are well known
and are both experienced in the apple
busines. They expect to handle ISO
to 200 cars of fruit through the ware
house this season.
Everybody is busy in the valley as
the apple harvest is nearly here. The
weather has been ideal for apples and
during the past week much change
has been added to the color and size.
Men are not plentiful in the valley
but it is thought there will be plenty
of help to take care of the large harvest
which is about to start. Owing to the
condition in the valley wages are ex
pected to be higher than usual.
The school directors accepted the
new building last Sunday and Contrac

ness Tuesday morning. The first days
enrollment was 125 scholars, which is
a fine showing for this school. Every

PRIEST RAPIDS POWER
FOR A NITRATE PLANT
Chelan County Marble May Be Usrd in
Making Nitrates and Fertilizer
From a confidential source this paper
learns that Priest Rapids is almost cer
tain to be selected as the site for de
veloping electric energy for the gov
ernment plant to be erected on the
Pacific coast to manufacture nitrate
and fertilizer, in which event Chelan
county limestone will come into use.
There is no other site on the east side
of the Cascades that offers the advan
tages for developing electric power that
lies dormant in Priest Rapids on the
Columbia river. Neither Oregon or
California has anything to offer the
government. There is no other body
of limestone on the Pacific coast that
equals in extent or purity the Chicamin
creek limestone deposit. All this
means more when it is understood that
some seven million dollars is to be ex
pended in building the plant and that
it will be in operation as long as the
Uuited States maintains its integrity.
QUIGG & SCAMAN SCENIC
HIGHWAY CONTRACTORS
Have Taken the Contract to Complete
Chelan County's Remaining Twelve
Miles West of Merrill
The contracting company removed
their outfit to a point near Gaynor, mid
way along the line of work, the first of
the week. Mr. Seaman, a member of
the firm passed thru Leavenworth Tues
day on his way to the scene of work
and will superintend the installation of
the camp. His company will endeavor
to complete as much as possible of the
work this fall and resume as early in
the spring as snow conditions will
permit. Chelan county has agreed to
have the road open to travel next
spring. King and Snohomish counties
have almost chmpleted their portion of
the road. The portion undertaken by
Snohomish county was very expensive,
while a portion of the road located in
King county was completed last year
the most difficult and expensive part
was built the past spring and summer.
Silage for Dairy Cows
As a means of furnishing succulence
to dairy cows, silage is probably the
best of anything that we have. It can
be used all the year around with splen
did results. The following are some of
the reasons why dairy men use silage
rather than furnishing succulence in
other ways:
(1) The crop is harvested at much
less cost than when a little is cut and
hauled from the field daily, as in the
case of a soiling crop.
(2) The crop can be harvested
just when it will make the most and
best feed.
(3) There is no danger of injuring
the land while harvesting the crop be
cause this is done when the ground is
hard.
(4) It prevents the waste of any
coarse stems, or stalks, that may not
be consumed if fed in another form.
(S) It provides a feed that is very
convenient to handle in any kind of
weather.
Silage is now beine successfully made
in this state from aDy of the following
crops: Corn, clover, oats and vetch,
oats and peas, wheat, barley, barley
and peas, barley and vetch, corn and
clover, and clover anri rye grass. Corn
is the most popular in many districts
because of the high quality of silage it
makes. In sections where corn can
not be grown successfully, any of the
other crops mentioned are recom
mended. —A. B. Nystrom, dairy divis
ion, State College of Washington.
