closed today after authorizing ap

In a statement following adjourn
ment the president called attention to
the "helpful humane legislation"
passed and declared that while he re
gretted " the additional legislation
dealing with the recent dispute be
tween the railroads and their em
ployes, had It not been completed he
had every reason to believe the ques

after Congress reassembles.
The revenue bill as signed by
President Wilson contains drastic
provisions empowering the president
to retaliate against foreign interfer
ence with American commerce, cre
ates a non-partisan tariff commission,
increases the duty on dyestuffs to
encourage their manufacture In the
United States, provides means to pre
vent dumping of cheap foreign made
goods into American markets after

stock, liquor and miscellaneous In

of Oregon, protested vigorously
against elimination by the conference

A centrally located power plant
actuated by crude oil internal com

and in operation before the end of
the year, according to Mr. Oscar L.
Daube, the New York broker and
investment agent, who promoted the
sale of scores of claims in the ex
treme western end of the Tonopah
district,' including the Great Western.
Mr. Daube Is here for the purpose of
closing contracts with the leading
mining companies and his proposition
is received with enthusiasm, as It
promises to solve the trouble of
securing an uninterrupted service at
all hours of day and night and at all
seasons of the year.
The plana provide for the con
struction of a plant on the flat west
of the railroad station whare plenty
of yard room for switching facilities
could be provided. It is estimated
that the cost of the plant contem
plated would be between 8300,000 and
$360,000, all of which has been sub
scribed.

morning In discussing the subject
with a group of mine operators. "The
engine would hare to come from
Sweden, but It would be quicker to
place the order there rather than to
trust to American manufacturers,
even providing the latter were In a
position to accept such a contract.
This engine burns the cheapest crude
oil and we believe we can make, it an
object for all mine owners to Join
In this enterprise. For instance, one
of the advantages would be to avoid
stoppages at critical times. Every
time the power went off at the Great
Western it Just happened It was long
enough to flood the mine and compel
us to install expensive machinery to
retrieve lost ground. Had the plant
been a - local one the disturbance
would not have lasted more than a ,
few minutes and the Great Western
would have been spared thousands of
dollars. Other mines have suffered
in the same way. The first unit of
the plant will call for 600 to 800
horsepower."
