dred thirty-nine thousand two hun

this morning to sign a numlcr. -of
bills. :'
PRAISED BY THE PRESIDENT
In a statement issued after Con
gress had adjourned, President Wil
'son called . attention to the "helpful
and humane legislation" passed and
declared while he regretted the ad
ditional legislation dealing with the
recent railroad dispute hadn't been
completed, he had every reason to be
lieve the question would be taken up
immediately after Congress reassem
bled. President Wilson signed the rev
enue bill at 9:25 this morning.
Owens withdrew his corrupt prac
tices bill. He declared the demo
cratic party had broken its platform

structing the lobby committee to in
vestigate an alleged foreign lobby.

appropriations were brought to the
grand total of $1,637,583,682, the

paredness and the calling into action

ELECTRIC LIGHT PLANT
AT SILVER SPRINGS

The city has very wisely loaned
Mr. Ed. Carmichael a small generator,

articles laid aside for more improved
machinery at the electric plant. Mr.

plant at the springs, and in a week
or ten days will be able to have
Ocala's little Atlantic Beach brilliant
ly lighted at night. -
The plant is located in a sheetiron
building which has been erected on the
rear of the site of the old pavilion,
and tho small it is complete. The
power will be furnished by a gasoline
engine. ' . ' .
Lights will be put in the bathhouse,
the new pavilion, all around the shore
to' the railroad station, and out in the
grove, which with its level ground
newly filled, its tables and benches,
is becoming a great favorite for pic
nic parties, and when electric lights
are glittering "among the trees will be
more so. - -
A novel and attractive feature
will be a big light down in the water
of, the springs, at the right distance
from the shore tojbe of the best ad
vantage to the swimmers. This will
make it an even greater pleasure to
go in swimming at night.
The big dancing pavilion is almost
ready, and when it is completed there
will be an opening ball at which Mr.

MR. BLITCH DEFENDS
MR. CATTS SOME MORE
Editor Star: I appreciate no lit
tle your courtesy in throwing open
your columns to me and while I am
too much engrossed in other affairs to
take up much of your space I shall
occasionally avail myself of same.
Mr. Catts has not appointed me his
champion; so far as I know he knows
nothing of these articles, but when
Mr. Catts 1 received the certificate of
nomination I as a democrat voluntar
ily became his champion.
I-conceded to Mr Knott the right
to make the contest, but I doubted the
wisdom of it, not only on his account
personally but on account of the
party and developments have proven
to me at least that it was the mistake
of his life and that he has rapidly
drifted from probably one of the most
loved men in the state to one of the
least loved among our prominent
men.
In making this "statement I do not
wish to be understood as throwing
off on Mr. Knott, as I am a friend to
him and associated with him in a
number of organizations, but Mr.
Knott has let his over zealous friends
put him in an attitude that he can
well and truthfully say Lord, deliver
me from my friends.
When Mr. Knott's attorneys at
Gainesville succeeded in having the
vote for governor thrown out of an
Alachua Catts. precinct on a techni
cality and counted other precincts
when the same technicality prevailed,
because they were for Mr. Knott, I i
immediately wrote Mr. Knott and
asked him to come out in the press;
and repudiate such methods, but to
this day Mr. Knott has not answered;
that letter and I therefore understood
that he approved such work andf in
my judgment that affair alienated
many hundred of his friends.
I have tried hard, Mr. Editor, to
draw you out on this Alachua county;
affair and the recounts in ) Madison,
Suwanee and Hamilton counties, but
just before you get to these subjects
you sidestep and say something
about' Mr. Catts' remarks about high
school girl graduates or marching
through Florida to the capitol or
puncturing my remarks about black
eyes. This is only scratching the
surface. You are in a position to and
fully capable of cracking the cocoa
nut and pouring out the milk to your
readers.
Tell us why on many of the Green
ville ballots the first choice was
marked in lead pencil and second
choice was marked in copying pencil
and whether or not you believe that
when all three inspectors and clerk
made affidavit that the ballots had
been tampered with if you believe it
and whether when these inspectors
tally Mr. Catts' 74 first choice votes
in the first count and the recount
under instructions of the court only
showed a little over half of those and
then 74 men come forward and make
affidavit that they voted for Mr. Catts
first choice if you believe that and if
you do believe it do you approve of
such work.
Mr. Editor, when Mr. Catts comes
forward asking that some three hun
dred votes actually cast and counted
for him hut for various reasons have
not been certified to the state can
vassing board be certified and when
this is done and. the recount in those
counties where the ballots have been
tampered with is thrown out and this
leaves Mr. Catts still the nominee,
will you come out like the good dem
ocrat you are and put your shouldei
to the wheel and help to elect him
governor? My prediction is that this
will be the case and everything
points to this and I am trying to give
you warning so you will be ready for
the "golden jubilee." J. S. Blitch.
