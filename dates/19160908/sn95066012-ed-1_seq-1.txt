Automobile Manufactor Starts
Proceedings Against Tribune
CALLED HIM AN ANARCHIST
Scorned for Refusing to Permit Em
ployes to Serve in National
, Guard.
Chicago, Sept. 8. Suit for $1,000,000
was Bled by Henry Ford, the Detroit
manufacturer, against the Chicago
Tribune in the United States district
court here yesterday. Mr. Ford asks
for personal damages as compensation
for an editorial printed In the Tri
bune July 23, which it is charged,
called Ford an "anarchist." The bill
charges that the Tribune sought to
bring the plaintiff into public hatred,
contempt, ridicule and llnanclal in
jury" by publishing the editorial.
The editorial, It is charged, referred
to Mr. Ford as "ignorant", a "deluded
human being," and "an anarchistic
enemy to the nation which protects
him in his wealth." The editorial al
so charged that employes of Mr. Ford
would lose their positions if they
went to the border as members of the
national guard.
The bill ciuotes the editorial as say
ing: "Ford is an anarchist. Inquiry at
the Henry Ford offices In Detroit dis
closes the fact that employes of Ford
who are members of or recruits in the
national guard will lose their places.
No provision will be made lor anyone
dependent on them. Their wages will
stop, their families may get along In
any fashion possible; their positions
will be filled and if they come back
safely and apply for their Jobs again
they will be on the same footing as
any other applicants. This is the rule
of the Ford employes everywhere. In
formation was refused as to the num
ber of American soldiers unfortunate
enough to have Henry Ford as an em
ployer at this time, but at the Detroit
recruiting oltice it was. Haiti that about
7f men will pay this price' for their
Services to their country."

STANDARD BARREL LAW
Vermont Shippers Notified of Change
by State Commissioner
Montpeller, Sept. 6. Commissioner
Ol weights and Measures George E,
Caroenter has sent out copies of the
new lodcral law establishing a stuul-
ird barrel. In his communication Mr.
Carpenter said that this United States
standard barrel law, which went into
ffect July 1, 1916, is one which Is of
special interest to Ycrinonters owing
to the fact that this state is one of the
best apple growing states in the l'n-
ion. It is important that every one
should be familiar with this law be-
ause it governs the measuring of a
multitude of commodities besides ap
plet;. The department of weights and mea
sures is in rcelpt ot a letter irom lite
mean of standards, Washington, 1).
('., containing regulations in regard
to this law. A part of t hut letter is
luoted below:
'Until i)i toiler 14916, barrels hav
ing a capacity of less than one stand
ard barrel and more than three four
ths standard barrel may be used but
only in case each of such barrels so
used is clearly, conspicuously and per
manently marked, branded or stemeil-
I in letters ami figures at least one
inch in height, with the words "Three
fourths standard bariel." If the bar
rel has two heads such marking shall
be upon both heads or upon the side
of the barrel, and It the barrel has
but one head such marking shall be
upon the side of the barrel. Barrels
having a capacity of less than three
Coin His standard barrel but more than
one half standard barrel, and barrels
having a capacity of less than one half
standard barrel but more than one
third standard barrel may also be used
but only if each such barrel is marked
one half standard barrel." or "one
third standard barrel," respectively,
in the same manner as is required in
the case of the barrels mentioned
abo i'
'The condition under which such
barrels may be used should be thor
oughly understood and strict followed
since If they are not fully complied
with the user will be liable to the pen
alties provided for in the act.'
That portion of the federal law that
deals with the size of the standard bar
rel reads:
'That the 'standard barrel or fruits.
vegetables and other dry eommodf-
ties other than cranberries shall be of
the following dimensions when mea
sures without destentlon of its parts:
Length of stave, twenty eight and one
half inches; diameter of heads, seven
teen and one elgth indies; distance be
tween heads, twenty-six Inches; cir
cumference of bulge, sixty-four Inches,
four tenths of an Inch: Provided, that
any barrel of a different form having
a capacity of seven thousand and
fifty six cubic inches shall be a stand
ard barrel, the standard barrel for
cranberries shall be of the following
dimensions when measured without
dllenlion of Its parts: Length of
staves, twenty-elgili and one half Inch
es; diameter of head sixteen and oni
fourth Inches; distance between hails
twenty-live and one fourth Inches;
circumference if bulge. Ilfty-elght ami
one half Inches; outside measuri
ment; and the thickness of staves not
greater than four tenths of an Inch.'
The department Is also sending out
BXtractS from the "adulterated but'
ter" act of May. A portion reads:
"Adulterated butter" Is hereby de
lined to mean a grade of butter pro
duced by mixing, reworking, reclnirn
lng in milk or cream, refining, or In

Final Agreement to Adjourn Was
Reached last Night
REVENUE BILL IS DOCTORED
Stamp Taxes Are Removed and the
Bill Made Less Drastic Corrupt
Practices Bill Fails.
Washington. Sept. 8. Congress will
adjourned this morning at 10
o'clock. After nine months' devoted to
legislation both houses held protract
ed sessions last night to wind up their
affairs by approving their conference
agreement on the emergency revenue
hill to raise approximately $200,000,
000 desired by the administration to
meet the extraordinary appropriations
for national defense and the Mexican
emergency.
Only the physical impossibility of
engrossing the revenue, measure In
time for the president's approval be
fore this morning prevented fin
al adjournment last night despite the
waning protests of members of both
houses who threatened, but did not
execute the threats to prolong the
session by demands for action on
measutes which were forced over un
til December.
Leaders of the Senate and House
agreed upon a concurrent resolution
to adjourn at 10 o'clock in the morn
ing and scores of members left town
on midnight trains eager to reach
their homes for participation In the
national olitical campaign.
The last appropriation measure, the
general dellclc-ncy bill, was adopted
by both houses while waiting for the
conference report on the revenue bill.
The corrupt practices bill to limit
campaign expenditures and the immi
gration bill, which President VV ilson
had announced he would veto if pass
ed, were put aside ami will be taken
up und passed to a vote early In the
Tieccnibcr session.
The revenue bill as it will go to
Piesident Wilson for approval to
morrow contains drastic provisions
empowering the president to re

Dillingham on Page
No man in United Status Senate
has been more regular in attendance,
more devoted to his work and more
painstaking In the discharge of his du
ties, than Senator Page, lie has
brought to the Senate all of those
characteristic activities of mind and
temperament which gave him leader
ship lii the business and political cir
cles ol Vermont.
His general characteristics can best
be described, perhaps, by referring to
a recent conversation had with a dis
tinguished Democratic Senator who
made this remark: --".My observation
has been that the Senate is made up of
two classes of men, those who feel it
their duty to speak on every question
but who are quite frequently wroug
both in their premises and conclu
sions, and secondly those who speak
less frequently, and never unless they
have something of value to say, but
who by reason of careful study and
patient Investigation are almost in
variably right in their action.'' Senat
or i'age belongs in the class last men
tioned. Those who have watched the course
of the two great parties as represent
ed in the Senate must have observed
that the Republican party has been
composed of men who have done their
own thinking anil maintained u self
respecting independence. Caucus act
ion is noi tolerated among them.
On the other hand, the caucus sys
tem has lang In en in vogue in the Dem
ocratic party, and its binding autlnnity
upon its mem hen has been declared
superior to their individual conscience
and judgment. That party since
coming into power has devoted itself
almost exclusively to the work of se
curing the adoption of purely admin
istration measures, dictated at the
White House, approved by the caucus,
and pushed through the Senate by
sheer force of numbers.
In the meantime, a vast volume of
business, less spectacular In charact
er but vitally important lo the welfare
of the nation, has been undcr-consider-atlon
by the appropriate comniitteoa,
at the meetings of which the Republi
can members, trained to the import
ance of this work, have been faithful
in their attendance while, to a lament
able degree, the Democratic members
have been conspicuous by their ab
sence. When it is remembered that
the character of the work done by the
Senate commltleeR Is so fully recog
nized by that body that more than 8U
percent 6f the measures lavoably con
sidered are adopted upon thsJr recom
mendations, und Without debate, the
importance of individual attention to
committee w'ork cannot be overesti
mated. These oisei vuiiwiiB arc preliminary
to. and intended to give force to the
statement that no Senator of my ac
quaintance has more consistently at
tended meetings of committees of
which he Is a member than Senator
Page, and no senator has given more
serious, laborious investigation au
thought to the problems under consid
eration than has he.
In a sltjgle term of service Senator
Page has. In addition to less import
ant committees, been assigned to agri
culture and forestry, banking and cur
rency, education ami labor, Indian
affairs, ami naval affairs, all of which
rank high in importance, and on each
of which lie has done exceptional
work. Should the senate again be
come republican, he would undoubted
ly become chairman of the committee
on agriculture nnd forestry, one of
Mist Importance both to the nation
and to the Individual state, and a posi
tion which was held by Senator Proct
or at the time of his death. In this
connection 1 want also to say. what is
not generally known, that the commit
tee i ll Indian affairs demands more
time imd attention, presents more
complex problems to he solved. Is
more exacting In its demands upon
the time and patience and Integrity
of its members, than almost anv otliet
one of the Senate committees. It
bus been customary to assign one New
Bngtand senator to this committee
with (lie thought that, as a representa
tive of n state unaffected by Indian
legislation, perhaps bis seilvce would
be of spin lal value in protecting both
the nation and the Indian wards of the
nation against frauds and loss. The
lute Senator Piatt of Connecticut stood
for years as a rock of defence against
oncrcachmenta upon the rights of
both. When he. by reason ot oilier
public duties, was compelled to relin
quish that work I was. at his request
assigned to the vacancy thus created,
.aicr my time was demanded in other
directions End Senator Page took tile
laboring oar and tins spent nights as
well as days of faithful but Inconspic
uous work in perfecting Indian legis-
lEtlon,
But I want to call special attention
to his work ns a member of the com
mittee on education and labor. He
early gave attention to the subject of
vocational education and. ns some
question has been raised as to Hie do
m if ci edit to which he Is entitled
and I do not hesitate to say that w lien
that measuri- becomes a law, as it
surely will, he will he as much entitled
to Bffdil in connection with the estab
lishment of the Laud Hraiit colleges.
Senator Page Worked substantially
nlo tie upon this measure for n period
of two or three years. Me gave It his
time, his effort and his means. Me
put himself In touch with educators
in every part of the nation, published
their views to the world, made them
known to the senate and. by his tire
less and resistless energy. Impressed
that body with the Importance of the
