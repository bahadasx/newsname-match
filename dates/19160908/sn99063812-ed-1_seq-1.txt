WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 8.
Inheriting Its most pressing prob
lems from the European war and Mex
ican bandits, and having had placed
before it one of the most elaborate
programs ever known, the Sixty
fourth congress probably will go
down In history as one of the nation's
most eventful sessions.
Called on twice to back the presi
dent in steps which it thought surely
meant war with Germany, and actual
ly appropriating millions for the Mex
ican punitive expedition, it neverthe
less found time for half a dozen do
mestic measures of major import
ance and to approve the heaviest
appropriation in American history.
"Preparedness" led in attention
throughout. The largest naval ap
propriation the world has ever known
In peace time, and next but one larg
est army budget, were approved. Back
of every economic measure child la
bor, rural credits, U. S. merchant ma
rine, workmen's compensation, was
the cry of "Industrial preparedness."
From the time the session opened,
the pot of Mexican affairs never ceas
ed boiling. Half a doxen republicans
led by Fall and Borah In the sen
ate were Insistent Interventlonal
ists. As the bandit raids into Amer
ican territory developed, border dem
ocrats became restless.
"Watchful waiting'' was Jerred as
a policy productive only of bandit
contempt and continued outrages.
Each outbreak furnished new ammu
nition for interventionists oratory, j
I At length guardsmen and troops were
sent to the border. The movement
was supported by both parties, al
though republicans charged it was &
political rather than a military step.
Senator LaFolIette pushed through &
resolution pledging the country
against intervention.
With the calling ot the state troops
a new principle in American military
history was established. For the first
time the president was enabled to.
send a national guardsman beyond
the boundaries of his country with-,
out either the guardsman's or bia
state's consent. Under the Hay
Chamberlain army reorganization,
tbey were simply drafted as the "fed
eral reserve."
Bitter protests from dependents
flooded the Capitol. Wives and moth
ers of men snatched suddenly front
their livelihoods appeared personally.
Two orders resulted, one releasing
men with dependents from serving,
and the other paying as high as $50
a month to the families of those who
chose to serve. Two millions was
appropriated for this. It was declar
ed to be on the same principle as tho
aid European belligerents extend to
families of those In the trenches.
The session began with President
Wilson's message urging a greater
army and navy. Fear of foreign com
plications and an apparent public sen
timent gave "preparedness measures
strong backing. But many demo
crats and Middle West republicans,

Klamath Is Willing To
Furnish Views of Road
Klamath Commercial Club and the
local Btrahorn railroad committee
are willing to furnish necessary views
ot Klamath county's portion of the
railroad right of way and country ad
jacent, and are willing to donate tho
use ot the Klamath moving pictures
to Robert E. Strahorn. This was de
cided yesterday at a meeting at the
club's headquarters.
Because Mr. Strahorn has famish
ed no definite information of the
amount ot photographic views ho
wants of the line ot the proposed
road or of the country to be tapped
by It, C. R. Miller, local scenic photog
rapher, could give no terms for tak
ing these views, although he ex
pressed a willingness to do the work
at a very reasonable figure.
The committee will write to Mr.
Strahorn, asking for Just what Tiewt
are wanted, and will tell him what
Klamath will do In any event.
