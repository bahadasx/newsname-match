You can't tell beforehand
whether a baby will be like its
mother or Its father; or like
some aunt or uncle, or one of Its
four grandparents, or its eight
great grandparents, or whether
It will have a mixture of the
characteristics of several rela
tives, or whether it will be the
"queer" one of the family.
And you can't tell, when
you plant a dahlia seed
whether the seedling will
have a blossom like a but
ton or like a feather duster;
like a little ball of quills or
like a plate of cold slaw;
or whether it will be entire
ly new—a flower such as
never bloomed in the world
before.
It Is a 100,000 to 1 chance
that It will be like some one of
the 100,000 known varieties; and
even If you win, there Is the still
greater chance that It will not
prove permanent—that is, that
Its tubers will not produce flow

Most people never plant dahlia'

then they know what they will
get.
But some prefer the gambler's
chance, with failure or fame os

One of these gamblers Is

in fixing the characteristics of
new seedlings. He lias originated
a number of new dahlias, which
have proved permanent.
Happening to be in Seattle last
Sunday, 1 asked Mr. Buttle to
tell me about the mystery of the
dahlia.
"1 don't know a thing about
It," 1 said, "and if I try to write
a story about dahlias I am likely
to make some funny mistakes."
"Well," observed Mr. Buttle
philosophically, "there won't be
many people who will know the
difference if you do.
"No two dahlia experts agree.
I sent to the agricultural depart
ment at Washington a few years
ago and got all they had on the
subject; and even that contra

my mind nobody knew anything
about it and I would have to find
out for myself.
"But I don't know, after the
bees have been busy all summer
hybridizing the varieties in my
garden, what kind of dahlias 1
will get If I plant seed from any
of them. And when I have found
out I don't know what the tubers
from that seed will produce next
year.
"For Instance, I got a new
seedling not long ago. There is
no cactus variety of that color

Over the long distance tele

attending the convention of

afternoon denied any knowledge
of the letter.
"1 do not remember having
written any such letter." he said.
"In fact, I can say positively that
I did not write it. It is a mali

"Whenever j get a new variety
I send one to Rhode Island, one
to New Jersey and one to Cali

I know it is permanent. Some
people have planted as many as

SEATTLE DROPS I
I WILL HUMPHREY I
Those Tacomans who turn out tonight to see and hear Will E. Humphrey, the Seattle candidate for
U. S. senator, will behold a man who this day was formally repudiated by the business men of his homo
town. He long ago was repudiated by the working men and by the larger part of the women's vote.
In a remarkable full page advertisement publised in this morning's Post Intelligencer 50 represen
tative Seattle business men, announce themselves as favoring the re election of Senator Poindexter,
whom Humphrey seeks to succeed.
The list of signers, to anyone acquainted in Seattle, is a roll call of the best leadership in Seattle busi
ness circles.
It is a knock-out blow for the senatorial aspirations of the narrow Humphrey.
