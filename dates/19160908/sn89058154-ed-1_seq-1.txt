VOLUME XV.
The great railroad strike has
been called off. The railroad
strikers held up Pres. Wilson and
the great Congress of the United
States to increase their pay just
20 per cent by a certain hour or
.they would bring such a catastro-
. pheupon the one hundred mil
lions of people unknown before
"in peace or war. It will go down
in history aa the most abject sub
mission to threats of unlawful
ness that ever occurred in any
government. It could have been
nipped in the bud, but politics
was behind it. Thousands of
employees had notified the rail
roads that they would be at their
posts Monday, and with other
t help the mail and passenger ser
vice would not have been dis
turbed. The effect is developing
here when negroes for pulling
fodder say they will work only 8
hours for a day's work. It is
needless to say they did not get
a job. It is time for people to
halt and do some thinking.
W. C. Coleman Passes Away
Wilson Carroll Coleman died Mon
day morning at 5 o'clock, at hia home
half mile north of Selmer.
He had been an invalid for several
; months, and lingered at death's door
for several weeks. The infirmities of
a strenuously industrious life wore
the crumbling body. '
v He was laid to rest in the ' Falcon
' cemetery at 2 o'clock Tuesday. A
large number attended at the ceme
tery, where religious services were
held by Revs. Maxedou and Houston.
He is survived by a wife, three
sons: Reuben, Albert and Eoloe; also
two daughters: Mrs. B. F. Ammons
and Mrs. Ada Surratt. He leaves
three sisters and three brothers, one
being J. D. A. Coleman, the efficient
agent of the M. & 0. for over a third
of a century. "
Mr. Coleman was of a nervous tem
perament and as a successful farmer
was over industrious in hard labor,
, which a rather frail body could not
stand. He was a good neighbor and
useful citizen. We" tender our cos
dolence to the'afflicted family.
Teachers' Meeting
The McNairy County Teachers' As
sociation met Saturday. The pro
gram as published in the Independent
was carried out, and several able ad
dresses on the various topics were
delivered. Forty-five teachers were
present. Prof. W, B. Simpson was
elected President and Miss Effie King
secretary. The teachers present
seemed to be much interested in the
Schools under the able direction of
Prof. Grantham, County 'Superintend
ent. '. ... -. :-
,. Senatorial Convention
... The democrats met Monday to se
lect delegates to the Senatorial Con
vention to meet at Jackson next Sat
urday. The delegates were instruct
ed to vote for W. K. Abernathy for
Sen s tor. The convention, was har
monious. We understand that Mr.
Stockard, of Benton . county, has
cough counties instructed to elect
him, which relegates Mr. Abernathy,
notwithstanding his home endorse
ment. - : .
High School Opening
At 8:30 Monday; the Selmer High
School opened, and the program as
published last week was carried out.
The children and most of the parents
were present. The school seemingly
will be the best ever had. Prof.
Simpson gave an able address in
which he set forth' the purposes of
the faculty and what was expected of
the students and patrons. The en
rollment was made afternoon of Mon
day.
The White Flag
The passage of the eight-hour bill
is the most pusillanimous act in the
history of the American Congress.
We are enable to recall a single in
stance when the legislative body of
the United States Government so ab
jectly surrendered its right of delib
eration as it has done in this case
Urged to immediate atcion by a
frightened executive, it has rushed
through legislation of the most radi
cal and revolutionary character, legis
lation that is probably if not certainly
unconstitutional, without the slightest
effort having been mads to w'eigh its
justice or injustice, without the least
consideration of its possible conse
quences. It is probably true that by
this act a public calamity has been
averted, but that does not alter the
fact that it has been . done under
duress, that the great Government of
the "United States has raised the white
flag without even a show of resist
ance. We say this in no spirit of opposi
tion to the principle of the eight-hour
day. Quite the contrary. But the
right or the wrong of the application
of that principle to the railway train
men ia at least a debatable question.
It may prove to be beneficent in its
operation, but Congress does not
know this. Nor does Congress know
that it will not prove most disastrous
in its application. It is a technical
matter as to which the ignorance of
Congress is as profound as that of
the public generally. Congress has
made no effort to inform itself. It
has not attempted to investigate the
merits of the case. It has thrown up
its hands. The provision for a post
mortem inquiry is without signifi
cance. Whatever may be the report
of the commission the eight-hour law
will stand undisturbed by Congress.
That is a kind of legislation that is
practically impossible to repeal in a
democracy. The railroads may be
bankrupted by the act, the public
may have to pay tremendously for its
maintenance, but it will continue in
force, unless the courts declare it
unconstitutional. That the courts
will do so, because of the wage sec
tion, is quite probable, but that does
not relieve the Congress of the re
sponsibility for whatever conse
quences may come from the estab
lishment of this precedent of hasty
legislation under compulsion. Sun
day's Globe-Democrat
GOVERNOR HOOPER HANDS
MR. McKELLAR SOME
HOT SHOTS
Says People of All Parties Will Be
Disappointed
Governor Hooper gave out the fol
lowing statement in regard to Mc
Kqllar's refusal to meet him in joint
debate:
"It is a weak candidacy that can
non look the opposition squarely in
the eye. It is a vulnerable cause
that cannot endure the. light and heat
of the open arena.
"This is the first time in the his
tory of the democratic organization
in Tennessee that its candidate for a
great state office has felt impelled to
evade a hand-to-hand conflict and be
take himself to the trenches. Mr.
McKellar evidently prefers long
range artillery to cold steel and the
hand grenade. - '
"The truth is that no hand-picked
candidate of the discredited Crump
machine, backed by the other city
machines of Tennessee, can stand up
before the people and fight.
"The little minority of 50,000 vot
ers that nominated McKellar lack 8
long Rhot of constituting the democ
racy of Tennessee, much less a major
ity of the general electorate.
"The pretense that McKellar want
ed a joint canvass, but that his cam
paign committee would not consent,
is broadly ludicrous. , "
In fact, Mr. McKellar announced in
tlje Memphis papers a week before
the committee acted "that he would
open his single-barreled campaign at
Gallatin. This was several days b&
foie the Democratic campaign com
mittee was even elected. This would
indicate that Mr. McKellar had al
ready decided to ask his campaign
committee to please restrain him from
plunging rashly into a joint canvass
with the republican nominee.
'The people of all parties will be
disappointed in McKellar's back
down. A joint debate is by far the
fairest and most satisfactory method
of campaigning ever adopted by can
didates for membership in either body
of the national congress. It is con
ducive to the conservative and ac
curate presentation of facts and ar
guments by candidates, and it enables
the people to arrive at a just estimate
SELMER. McNAIRY
of the comparative merits of the men
who seek their suffrage.
"When I open my campaign which
will be soon, . the people will know
that my utterances in regard to men
and measures jsill be such sb I did
not fear to offer where my opponent
had the opportunity to make answer.1

Buck
Saves His Grandson
I went to my son John's to-day, and jist as I come nigh,
. Out in the thicket by the barn I heard a boy cry:
- "Please, pappy! let me off this time; I'll not go there no more
Don't whup me pappy I'll be good, yes that f will, fer shore!"
, D'ye know, the beggin of that child went through me then and there!
The time come back when John himself had made to me that prayer,
And I had spared bim. Now he took a long, slim hickory switch
To whup his child. I ops and says: "Stop that! I'll have no Bitch!
"What has the little feller done, that you should punish him?
Put down that switch, or you will ketch a taste of this here limb!"
John dropped the switch, looked kindo shamed, and said: "The boy,
last week
Was disobedient, fer he went a-swimmin in the creek.".,
"A-swimmin in the creek!" says I. "You've done that, many a time,
And now youre goin to wallop him, jist like it was a crime.
A boy that is a real boy, in water loves to play,
And he has earned it, when he works hard in the fields all day.
"Suppose I'd whupou cause you shot them squirrels in that tree,
Or bruised your back for swimmin too what would you think of me?
Suppose the Lord would punish you for every little fault?
In this here beatin of your boy it's time to call a halt.
"Jist as the Lord forgives your Bins, fergive yer young ones too;
They'll not fergit it, and they wont think any less of you.
Don't have so many 'donts' to give; be patient, firm and kind,
Fergit the hickory, and you'll see your boys will love to mind."
I know jist how that boy felt; his thankful little face
A-smiling at me through his tears, like I was sayin Grace.
Don't whup the the boys because they go a-swimmin now and then;
Don't spoil their humble little joys; they'll soon enough be men!
