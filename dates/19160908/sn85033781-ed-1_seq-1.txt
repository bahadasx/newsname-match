REMAINS OF SPLEN
DID MAN AT REST
The funeral of he late I. A.
Whitman was held from the residence
last Sunday afternoon. The house
service wai out under the spreading
I -M ii - 1 9 1 . J- x
orancnos 01 uie nuge cnesuuu irees
that dace ed planted with his own
hands inanv years ago. Rev. E. W,
Smith of the Presbyterian church had
charge of the house service. His re
marks were most fitting for the
occasion, and were a splendid trihute
to an honored and highly respected
citizen. The pall bearers were C, L
Batchelder of Birmingham, Mich., C.
Prospect cemetery was in charge of
Fau Paw ledge No. 25 F. and A. M.
of which organization diseased has
been an honored member for many
yean. M. H. Young, son-in-law of
the deceased pave the beautiful
masonic ritualistic service. This was
The profusion of beautiful flowers;
the long line of masonic brethern; And
the large assembly of friends and
neighbor- all gave mute but eloquent
testimony of the splendid character
and life of deceased. Thus another
splendid citizen is laid to rest.
Held meeting here last Fri
day to outline plans for
campaign. C. E. Lewis
of Lawton is campaign
manager of county.
The "County Dry Committee" held
a meeting in the Council Rooms last
Friday to make arrangements for the
coining campaign. The committee is
now organized as follows: -Sheldon
Coleman, Lawton, lYesident; David
Anderson, Paw Paw, vice president;
w. c. Mosier, Paw Paw, secretary;
C. E. Lewis. Lawton, Publicity and
Campaign manager. It was decided
to use considerable newspaper ipaee
during the campaign, and to wage a
vigorous campaign for votes in Van
Huron county from now until the polls
close on election day in November.
This county is safely in the "Dry"
column where it has been for many
! .vea,, but every additional vote that
,can be rolk(l UP for the aus0 hcre'
will assist of course in the grand total
on election day. The general impress
ion seems to be that the state will go
"Dry." The fact that Van Buren
county is already in the "Dry" column
however will not lessen the activity of
the committee and their workers. It
is a state issue and votes in Van
Buren county will be just as valuable
as those in "Wet" counties. This
question will be the big issue in
! Michigan during the coming cam-

"OUT COMMITTEE
IS GETTING BUSY
ISN'T HE THE
IMPROVEMENTS AT POSTOFFICE
The Post office lobby now presents
a very neat and attractive appear
ance. The walls and ceilings have
been newly painted and neat burlap
placed on the side walls. F. R. Hesi
was the artist. The Postmaster has
also placed a neat bulletin board in
the lobby for all notices which have
heretofore been pinned on the walls.
This adds much to the appearance of
the lobby, and does away with the un
sightly notices and all kinds of ad
vertising matter, which should never
be permitted on the walls of any
public place. The postmaster is to
be congratulated.
MONDAYS' STORM

last Monday night by a hard rain

Some of the furniture was removed,

succeeded in saving the adjoining
buildings, but the Sylvester store was
a complete loss. The store and stock
was partially covered by insurant .

HANDSOME MAN!
N FY BR AGAIN FOR HARRY.
H. W. Showerman of the firm of
Showerman Bros, is going out of the
mercantile business never to return.
He announces in this issue of The
TniS Northerner a gigantic Closing
Out sale to start on Saturday Septem
ber !)th. Everything in the immense
stock is going to be cold at prices
which will appeal to everybody. This
will be a genuine "Going Out of
Business" sale. Harry has issued the
edict, and those who know him, know
that when he once says it, he means
just what he say, and there is no re
trenchment. No more mercantile
business for Harry.
CHAU1 AUQUA SATISFACTORY.
Chautauqua business for the year
r.)l() is now all closed, l he grounds
are cleaned up and left in even better
condition than before. The financial
end, while not as large as the man
agement had hoped, is satisfactory.
There is no deficit, which speaks well
for the Paw Paw chautauqus when
compared with those of our neighbor
ing towns. Everything looks bright
for the future of our ehautauqua here.

passed away after a brief illness at
his home in Paw Paw, August 22nd,
1916. He came to Paw Paw with

HAS UuMMtNUtU
The Grape Harvest is on. Champ
ions and Moore's Early varieties are
being marketed this week. The
Wolverine will ship probably two car
loads from Paw Paw and four from
lawton. The Fruit Growers Union
are loading here, and the other
I associations are shipping from other
points. The price on these early
varieties will probably be in the
neighborhood of. fifteen or sixteen
cents per eight pound basket. No
one cares much for these early vari
eties of grapes, and the concensus of
opinion seems to be among the man
agers of the various associations
that the champion grape at least If I
serious drawback to the grape indust
ry. They are always inferior in
quality, and cannot help but establish
a price that will injure the sale of
the better varieties when they come
on the market. Concords will
probably be ready for the market
about September twentieth.
Harry Turner of Covert and E.
Decker of South Haven were callers
at The True Northerner office last
Monday. They are rural mail car
riers in their respective townships,
and were enroute to Decatur to attend
the annual meeting of the County
Rural carriers association.
L
OPEN SEPT. IBID.
Discrepancy between State
and Federal laws causes
misunderstanding which
is settled by State Game
Warden.
There has been some question as to
the opening dates for Duck shooting.
The misunderstanding undoubtedly
has been brought about by the discre
pancy between the Federal and State
laws. The following communication
from William R. Gates, state game
warden will settle the matter, and
leave no doubt as to the opening date
of the open season.
"You are hereby notified that the
new Federal regulations on water
fowl, which includes all kinds of ducks
(except woodducks) also coots, gall
inules and jacksnipes has changed the
open season from September 1st. to
September 16th, in each year.
The regulations also provide that
the state date governs when it open
the season later or closes it earlier
than the Federal regulations.
You will also note that jacksnipe
coots and gallinuls are now classed
with water fowl, and under the pres
ent regulations the open season in
Michigan will be September 16th, to
December 15th, inclusive, for the kill
ing of such birds."
BOARD OF CANVASSERS MET.
The Board of County Canvassers
met at the Clerk's office Tuesday to
canvass the vote of the Primary
Election. George W. Matthews and
William Harrison, two of the mem
bers of the Board were not present,
and O. W. Rowland, the other member
filled the vacancies by appointing
Ford R. Wilber and Lynn Lake.
SOME REAL BARGAINS LEFT.
Mrs. Brown desires to say through
the columns of The True Northerner
that she still has many articles of
household furniture, which she will
close out at a bargain. All will be
sold before she starts for her South
ern home, and anyone desirious of
real bargains will do well to see her
at the Trescott tCOttSfSi 611 North
Grempf street.
"FRECKLES."
The "Freckles" company played to
a fair audience at the Opera house
last Friday evening. The company
was a very good one, and gave a most
creditable performance. The songs
were just a little off, but the superb
acting more than made up for the
disappointment in the music.
Wl
PICKLE INDUSTRY
HAS MEANT MUCH
Notwithstanding the dry
season, both factories
will do a record bus
iness this year
NEARLY 40,000 Ml. FOR YEAR
Price has ranged from 35c to $1.00
per bushel. With average of
HOc. Rain will help late
pickings
Very few people have any concept
ion of the magnitude of the pickle
business here, or what the industry
means to the community. On account
of the exceedingly dry weather, this
has not been an ideal year for the
business, and yet there have already
been delivered and bought by the Paw
Paw factories, nearly 25,000 bushels
of cucumbers. The Budlong company
have bought 15,000 bushels, and the
Keokuk nearly 10,000 more. The
rains the first of the week have
brought the vines to life again, and it
is probable that nearly 15,000 bushels
more will be delivered before the
season closes. The price has ranged
from thirty-five cents to one dollar
per bushel, probably an average of
eighty cents per bushel.
The Budong company manufactures
the Dill pickle at the factory, and
ships them to jobbers in casks. Al
ready more than 1,000 casks of Dills
have been shipped from the Paw Paw
plant. The balance of the stock is
stored in huge vats until spring and
then put in tanks and casks and ship
ped in carload lots. The local plant
employs from ten to twelve people
all local labor, with John Haworth as
manager. One night last week there
were forty teams in line waiting to
unload. This was the larg st day and
1,500 bushels were taken in.
Wayne W ilson has charge of the
Keokuk plant. This plant does not
employ as much labor, but the price
paid for cucumbers is the same at
both plants.
It is well worth ones time to go to
the plant on a busy evening to see the
volume of business transacted. It
has meant much to Paw Paw this year
and will mean much more in the
future.
TELEGRAPH OFFICE
IN LAYERTY STORE
After much agitation for many
years, Paw Paw is at last to have a
telegraph office up town. As soon as
the wires can be strung and equip
ment installed, a Western Union
office will be opened in Laverty's
Variety store. Mr. Laverty is an
operator of experience, and was for
merly the Western Union operator at
Charlotte, Michigan. He takes the
office on a commission basis, and
whether or not the office is to remain
up town permanently, depends on the
amount of business he can transact.
It is therefore up to the people to co
operate in every possible way, and
boost for the Western L'nion business
at the Laverty store.
