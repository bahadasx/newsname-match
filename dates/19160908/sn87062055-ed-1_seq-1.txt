EXPLAINS WOMAN'S CAUSE
IN REPLY JOJPEN LETTER
Miss Vivian Pi!rcc, who left on
Wednesday night for Williams, tho
Grand Canyon and points west, where
she will continue to organize for the
woman's party to bring about tho
complete enfranchisement of women,
reported before she left that her three
meetings in Flagstaff had filled her
with confidence in the outcome of the
election in November. "The advance
guard of women, here as elsewhere,
are ready to put 'suffrage first' The
rest will follow in large numbers be
fore tho election in November. I be
lieve the women of Arizona will re
fuse to support a candidate who has
for years opposed the national enfran
chisement of women.
"Of course there are many narrow
ly partisan women who infer that our
party is a blackmailing party out to
'deliver" tho vote of western women to
Hughes. One of our old-time mem
bers in Williams cent an open letter
to me in thi3 vein. In justice' to tho
women who have read the letter of
Mrs. Kate Williams of Williams, a
woman of splendid intelligence whom
we are sorry to sco unable to rise
above partisanship, I sent tho "follow
ing reply:
"My Dear Mrs. Williams: If you
do not believe that to the women' of
this nation suffrage is the foremost
political issue of tho day, you cer
tainly do not belong in either the
Congressional Union for Woman Suf-
frage or the Woman's Party.
"When you joined the Congression-
al Union for Woman Suffrage, of
which tho Woman's Party is merely
the western wing, you signed a card
which admitted you only on condition
that you believed 'woman suffrage tho
foremost political issue of tho day,'
to be worked for 'without considering
the interests of any national political
party.'
"For four years the democratic
' party has consistently opposed the on-
' franchlsement of the women of this
nation nationally, the reform we are
in existence to further. President
Wilson's opposition has been out
standing .in spite of the fact that
western 'democrats have pleaded for
a hearing for- national suffrage.
"The woman's party is merely ask
ing those women who believe that
only with the enfranchisement of
women can". there bo a real democ
racy, to .deny their support to a party
that does not believe in tho speediest
road to tho enfranchisement of
women. We are not telling women
, how to vote. We are telling tHem
how NOT to vote if they place women
above party. You forget that every
party except the Democratic party Is
in favor of the national enfranchise
ment of women.
"Wo. are not attempting to 'deliver'
tho western woman vote. We could
not There arc too many partisan
women like yourself. Wo believe,
however, that thousands of women,
enough to constitute the balance of
power in this election, will vote
against Wilson for tho same reason
that many men will he has failed to
satisfy them.
"Your remark that eastern women
do not want suffrage simply shows
that you aro ill-informed as to the
f situation in the east, where tho fail
ure to pass suffrage grows out of the
large foreign vote, combined with tho
alliance of corrupt interests.
"I would add that our organization,
which you hastily joined, did not
work for suffrage planks last June,
as you would have realized had you
followed our activities. Planks in
platform, politicians' promises for the
future, do not interest us. We realize
that THIS administration CAN pass
suffrage when it cares to take the
representative of tho firm, was in
Flagstaff and met with the directors;
his proposition was accepted from
seven which had been submitted to
them.
H. C. Trost, tho senior member of
the firm, was in Flagstaff some weeks
ago to get a view of the location and
conditions surrounding in order to
better submit a building and plans
to suit tho locality. As evidence of
his belief that a big hotel building
would bo a paying proposition in
Flagstaff, ho agreed to take a lib-
I eral amount of the stock if the
building was built.
The directors have been putting
forth every effort to get the financial
end of tho game going, and to pre
pare for actual clearing of ground
and doing all preliminaries this fall.
I
same interest in national freedom for
American women that it has taken in
Indians and Filipinos.
"If tho splendid declaration of Mr.
Hughes on national suffrago failed to
crystalize into action in tho event of
his election, our organization would
steadily oppose his administration as
we now oppose the democratic. We
are, I repeat, a non-partisan organi
zation formed to pas3 the national
suffrage amendment, and pledged to
put woman suffrage first, instead of
party.
Very sincerely,
VIVIAN PIERCE."
GUS RIEMER, PIONEER
SnEEPMAN, IS DEAD
Gus Riemer, one of the pioneer
sheepmen of northern Arizona, passed
away in Los Angeles Monday, while
undergoing an operation for stomach
trouble.
There was no more lovable man in
the whole state than Gus Riemer; he
was one of the first successful sheep
men in the country, and one who
never flinched 'at the .hardships, en
tailed during the early days on the
range. At one time ho was tho part
ner of James May, and the two -were
among tho well-to-do sheepmen of
that1 time: Later, bad ,Juck and bad
years reduced him to a mere pittance,
but with his usual perseverence he
again secured a small fortune and re
fired from business.
During tho past few years he mar
ried and made his home in Williams,
where he had built a comfortable
home to spend the declining years of
his life.
Ho was a man, and will be remem
bered as such by those who knew him
best
CANDIDATES SPEND ALL
NIGHT HELPING AUTOS OUT
Tom Campbell, tho republican can
didate for governor, accompanied by
George H. Smalley, candidate for
state tax commissioner, and Doane
Merrill, candidate for state auditor,
returned to Flagstaff Wednesday in
their famous gasoline burning brute,
owing to the fact that recent rains
had badly puddled the roads in the
eastern counties. It had been their
intention to go south to Springer
ville and from there to Globe, thus
swinging around the circle, but there
appeared too much trouble ahead to
attempt it, from reports received
from other travelers.
The gallant party of campaigners
helped a party of New York ladies
out of a bad mud hole about fifteen
miles this si.de of Winslow, where
eleven other autos got stuck in suc
cession. The campaigners stayed
with the job all night, but kept the
road open to all comers.
Making a state wide campaign in
an auto has its strenuous side, but
as a vote getter all the candidates
agree that it gets down among the
people who are doing the voting and
affords the real opportunity of getting
acquainted, not only with the people,
but the wants of the people, as well
as local conditions.
The party went enthusiastically, on
their 'way south, firmly .impressed
with the fact that the people, arc with
them this year.
Big Fruit Crop at Tuba.
Supt Walter Runke was in from
Tuba this week, bringing in a few
samples of the pear crop. Supt
Runko says that tho Indian farms
around Tuba never produced a better
fruit crop than they did this year.
A number of years have been spent
in getting fruit trees planted and
brought to a bearing stage, but from
now on they expect to be able to
supply a great amount of fruit to
Flagstaff.
CAMPBELL AND KIBBEY
' REMEMBER SOLDIERS
The enlisted men of Arizona, num
bering nearly one thousand, have
just been made happy by a huge ship
ment of smoking supplies from the
combined Red Cross societies of
Phoenix and Glendale, Among many
other good things, there more than
enough Campbell cigarettes and Vel
vet Sraokarols to go around.
And theroby hangs a tale.
It was a lucky thing for the boys

committee ,dld not know very much
about tobacco, and wrote to military
headquarters for suggestions. The
boys almost unanimously asked for
Camel cigarettes, which gave the
lady chairman a bright thought
She went immediately to the head
quarters of tho Republican state cen
tral committee and consulted Tom
Campbell, who was just starting
north on a campaigning trip. She in
timated strongly to him that a fw
boxes of Cornel cigarettes from him
would be acceptable as well as ap
propriate, and was so encouraged
when ho promised her a thousand
packages that she turned to Joseph
H. Kibbey, who is running on the re
publican ticket for the United States
senate and secured a contribution for
smoking tobacco and pipes.
With a truly feminine sense of the
catemal fitness of things she invested
Kibbey's generous donation in Velvet
Smokarols Velvet Joe, of course
and the necessary pipes.
These contributions were tho first
to be received, and luck seemed to fol
low them, for the committee in
charge of the smoker campaign re
ports the receipt of a, great variety
of donations from business houses
and private citizens of Phoenix and
Glendale.
Tho chairman of the commitce was
so .delighted with the success of the
campaign that she forgot all about
her promise to keep the secret of thr
popular candidates, and the story of
the "autographed" smokes leaked out
through the local papers.
WOMEN GREATLY INTERESTED-.
.IN REPUBLICAN WORK
The Flagstaff Republican Club held
a very interesting meeting last Mon
day evening, which was "well attended
by both ladies and men.
One of. the main features of the
meeting was an address by Miss Viv
ian Pierce, who is organizing the
women of tho county for woman's
suffrage in order that nation wide
suffrage may be obtained in the
United States. She presented force
ful arguments why the ladies should
be interested'in the subject, not from
a party point of view, but in the in
terest of the women of the whole
country. She avowed that her party
had no candidates and only one plat
form woman suffrage a vote along
with that of the men, Indians and
others who have been taken into part
nership with the governmental af
fairs of tho United States. She ad
vised that President Wilson was "in
terested" in the subject; other demo
cratic representatives of the stato
had been against their movement,
consequently the women of tho coun
try were for the republican nominees,
because they were not only for the
woman movement, but were doing
what they could to help it along.
In Coconino county the voter,
woman or-man, are at the mercy of
the county recorder, who seems to
think. his only duty is to register dem
ocrats who aro in line with' his be
liefs; you may register otherwise if
you insist The people seem to feel
that when they pay their taxes into
the county treasury, it is neither
democratic, republican or socialist
money, but coin of the realm to be
expended in the interest of the whole
people of the county; that any officer
shall consider himself the whole peo
ple and their special guardian be
cause of their mental inability, is re
sented by tho averago voter.
There was a representative gather
ing at the meeting, Including a num
ber of the west end candidates who
addressed the meeting, and a special
meeting was called for next Monday
evening, the day preceding the pri
maries, when all are expected to come
for a last conference before tho big
game opens on the last lap of the
campaign.
Mr. and Mrs. J. P. Kerley came in
from Tolchaco yesterday. Mrs. Ker
ley will remain in Flagstaff for the
next few months with her baby, owing
to ill health. Mr. Kerley has leased a
house for the time being in the Sli
pher neighborhood close to Observa
tory hill.
CHEAP SKATE WOULD
RAFFLE OFF TO
Governor, Hunt received a letter
that was almost dumbfounding. It
practically took him off his feet and
set him to thinking more seriously
than at any time previously in his
campaign. It has to ,do with a very
important subject, that of matrimony.
The letter was from a woman, or
possibly a girl, she failed to state
which, giving her initials and ad
dress, but not her name, who lives in
Washington, D. C. Sh$ is looking for
information and incidentally a hus
band. The letter enclosed a clipping from
the Washington Evening Star of Au
gust 8, which stated that the third
assistant postmaster general had re
ceived an application from an Ari
zona man to aid him in raffling him
self off to one of 2500 women. His
proposition is to sell tickets on him
self at $1 per shot A drawing is
then to take place, and the lucky
woman can have him and $2,500 to
start life with.
The unknown man who is so
anxious to get marrie.d, states that
his reason for taking this novel man
ner of getting married is on account
of the shortage of women in Arizona.
The avoilable supply has dropped to
such an extent, he says, that it is al
most impossible to get a bride, un
less unmercifully rich, or good look
ing beyond the dreams of avarice.
The woman wh writes to Governor
Hunt states that she is anxious to
got into communication with the gen
tleman who is so anxious to take the
fatal step, but docs not know his ad
dress or name. She thought that per-
haps the governor, with his wide ac
quaintance, might know the guilty
j person.

PAVING IDEA STILL
CONTINUES TO GROW
Another block' of paving has
been added to the contract now
being completed by theCali
fornia -, Arizona .Construction
Gomnariy -in 'Flagstaff.
' Property owners on East
Aspen Avenue have signed up
for the block in which the Co
conino Sun is located, and it
was promised that preliminary
work of preparing the street
for the paving would com
mence today or tomorrow;
This will cover the main part
of the business district of the
town for the present, though
there is every evidence that
the business district of the
town will soon widen out and
demand more paving to keep
up with tho march of progress
Flagstaff is making.
After some years of trials
and tribulations, in which the
Sun endeavored to do its share
in convincing .the business men
nnd the people generally that
the improvement of the prop
erty owned was a good invest
ment, and gave, as good a per
centage of profit as in taking
the same caro of other busi
ness interests, the change has
come about.
At times the game was dis
couraging, but the people
kept on electing men with
progressive ideas, one set af
ter another, wearing out one
bunch with contentions and de
tails, but getting more enthu
siasm with the next bunch. It
was the same old game that
every "growing town has gone
through until some tangible
results were obtained then
progress was rapid and sure.
Opportunities in Flagstaff
are just sis great today, for
the man who grasps the idea
and develops it, as they were
at any time in its existence,
in fact better, for the long
years of pioneering have been
done and there is no question
as to the future of tho city.

CORONER'S JURY IN PRESCOTT CASE FINDS
"DEATH WAS CAUSED 8Y UNKNOWN PARTIES
Mystery still surrounds the killing,
of "Dutch May" and her supposed
husband, whose remains were found
in a badly burned condition, both shot
through the head and their throats cut
in a small shack in the rear of the
woman's house in the redlight dis
trict The coroner's jury, after putting in
a day and part of the night listening
to the testimony of witnesses, ren
dered the following verdict, at about
12 o'clock last Thursday night
"We, the jury, find that the de
ceased came to their deaths by knife
and gunshot wounds inflicted by par
ties unknown."
The jury was composed of the fol
lowing men:
W. H. Anderson, Frank Service,
Paul Keller, Dennis Hibben, H. C.
Lockctt, P. M. Falder. A. J. Dia
mond, who had been summoned, was
sworn in and viewed the bodies, but
was afterwards excused.
The testimony in the case was
pretty much the same as was given
in the Sun last week, and there were
few new developments.
A small store house constructed of
corrugated iron was inspected by
Judge Harrington, City Marshal Mur
ray and Assistant County Attorney
Wall. The building was a short dis
tance from the board shack where the
tragedy occurred. The door of this
was found open and blood clots liber
ally sprinkled on the floor. There
was a print of a bloody hand on the
side of the .door, showing that the
murderer had visited this place on
his bloody errand. The place was
used as a small store room. Nothing
was found disturbed, and it was im
possible to ascertain what the mur
derer visited the place for.
A letter was received from the dead
man's sister from Kansas City, which
GARAGE STARTS A SHORT
BUT EXPENSIVE FIRE
The Northern Arizona Motor- Co.
garage started some excitement yes
terday afternoon when it sent up, a
black column of smoke enveloping
pretty much the whole building.
The fire originated in the vulcaniz
ing room, where a gasoline fire had
been kept burning. The surroundings
of the room were of wood and jt did
not take but a short time after the
explosion to start flames all over the
building.
The damage was mainly to the in
terior of the room' where the vulcan
izing was done, and to the roof of the
building. Two new cars were dam
aged by having their tops badly
burned, one .of them a total wreck,
while the other was taken out when
only partially consumed. A motor
cycle also received a bunch of com
bustion, but -was mainly to the good
when taken out Several cars in the
garage were taken out before any
damage was done them.
The building is a concrete structure
with a concrete-floor; the vulcanizing
room was but a frame affair adjoining
the office, and this with, the roof r-e
ceived tho greatest part of damage
done by the flames.
J. W. Francis, who owns the build
ing, had leased the repair part of the
place and only- has charge of the
storage and sales end of the garage.
The fire was of only a short dura
tion, but the damage done before the
auto truck and fire company reached
the place will amount to a couple of
thousand dollars or more.

day from Winslow. Mr. Rock is in

staff, the paved streets and climate,

No response was received from the
address given by Prescott in his short
note, from the women in Santa Bar
bara, California, who is supposed, to
be his wife. He had shown a pic
ture of the woman and child to friends
here some time before the crime oc
curred, and claimed they were photos
of his wife and child.

opened and blood was found spattered
over the garments it contained, also
a bloody gun. So far as known noth-,

there was considerable valuable jew

"Dutch May's" father, whose name
was Peter Sutter, was located at Port
land, Oregon, and advised of the trag

ton he stated that he did not havo
sufficient funds to send for' the re
mains of his daughter, and asked that
I she be buried here.
No new evidence has been produced
to shed new light on the affair, and
, the general opinion seems to be that
it was a double murder, though there
are very slight grounds to base it
upon. A number had heard the
couple quarreling during the after
noon arid at night There was no
question but they had been having
' some personal trouble over affairs
that had arisen since his returning

FUGSTAFF'S ACTIVITY
L. C. Welch, who returned Friday
last from a trip to Arizona, ,was
speaking of those places which im
pressed him most from their activity,
and stated that Flagstaff gave him,an
idea of what cnterprize and civic
pride accomplished in the building of
a town and community. He reports
Flagstaff as putting on metropolitan
airs, and making street improvements
of, the same character as found in the
larger cities, and on every hand .was
found an activity and unity of pur

only desirable results can be obtained

civic pride and public betterment ,Mr.
Welch said that ht so fully enjoyed

country, down near Mormon Lake,
last week, preaching to the sheep he
had been herding for Colin Campbell
and otherwise behaving queerly. He
.jras found by the rustler and brought
to Flagstaff. He was tried for insan

that he had gathered together many
delusions and ' was adjudged insane
and ordered to the asluy by Judge
Perkins.
Eliberio Archuleta, a young boy
about sixteen years of age, a recent
arrival from Zachataaces, Mexico,
was found wandering around in the
first precinct near the Jaklo residence
a couple of days ago, and arrested.
He seemed to have been some queer,
but on questioning during the exam
ination it was learned that he had
come from Mexico only a short time
ago and had nearly starved to death.
When he got to Flagstaff he had been
given a few square meals, which
seemed to have caused him considera

the time being. He was declared sane
and liberated. '
