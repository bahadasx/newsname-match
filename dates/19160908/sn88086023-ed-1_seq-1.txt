remarkable session of congress
has Just closed. It was full of
helpful, humane legislation con
stituting Important Contribu
tions to defense, economic pro
gress and the wholesome life of
the country.
It Is to be regretted the ses
sion could not continue long
enough to complete the program
recentb projected regarding
tile accommodation of labor dis
putes between railways and em
ploye. Only the most press
ing parts of the program were
completed. The remainder are
merely postponed until there is
time for more deliberation. 1
have reason to believe it is the
purpose of the leaders of the
two houses to undertake addi
tional legislation Immediately
after reassembling. It's evi
dent the country must be re
lieved of the anxiety ereated by
recent events regarding the fu
ture accommodation of such dis

TELLS EUGENE HE
HAS REAL ROUND-UP
clarence Adam Claims, He Has Same
Steers, ha mo Horses and Saine
Cowboys That Mke Ieudleton
Show.
The Round-Up directors are again
exercised over what they declare are
false and misleading statements
srhiCa are being made by Clarence
j Adams relative to wild west shows he
; is staging in western Oregon.
1 Here Is a sample of the statements
to which they object. It Is the lead
i ing paragraph of a story in the Eu-
gene Register:
"Eugene's Round-Up next week will
j be fully aa good as Pendleton's. Clar-
. ii . Adams or ins nuuno-up man
agement told the membere of the
Chamber of Commerce at the regular
Wednesday luncheon yesterday. No
t ne in western Oregon, he added,
needs to go clear to Pendleton to see
the great wild west spectacle. The
cowboys, the cattle and the horses
that will appear here will be practi
cally the same, both in identity and
in number, that will appear at Pen
oleton." Mr. Adams, who formerly lived In
this, county, recently staged a show
at Ashland and advertised it as the
Pendleton Round-Up. He has never
had any official connection with the
Round-Up and has never had the use
of one head of Rounn-Up stock in his
shows. He has borrowed the use ot
the name and slogan of Pendleton's
show quite geenrously and has doneifor settlement. The other side now
everything he could to Induce the be
lief that he is giving the valley people
an exact reproduction of the Pen
dleton show.
In connection with her . "Round
Up." which will be put on next week,
Eugene will also have a "Happy Val
ley.' an Imitation of Pendleton's
"Happy Canyon."
