Kentucky on the Republican tick
et, was called for and delivered
one of the strongest speeches
delivered this year. Mr. Kash
did not leave a greasy snot of
the Democratic administration,
and made it plain to all present
that the party of Lincoln and
McKinley was the right party to
tie on to in the coming election.
At the conclusion of Mr.

Lexington, Ky., Sept. 5, 1910.
Special to the Mountain Advocate.
Today was a great day for Lexington and Fayette county. As
scheduled, the special train bearing Chas. E. Hughes, Republi
can nominee for President arrived at Union station at 11 o.clock
and was at once received by the committee and rushed to the
Phoenix Hotel where a reception was given.
The crowd began to com in on last night, and this morning
every regular train over ever road coming into this city was crowd
ed to its fullest capacity, besides all this many special trains weie
run to accomodate the people that wanted to hear the next presi
dent speak. There was music, and applauds were loud and long
It is a low estimate to say that there were 20,000 people in attend
ance and that it was the greatest political demonstration ever wit
nessed in the Capital of the Blue Grass section of the State.
Promptly at 2:30 p. in. Hon. John W. Yerkes, the chairman,
called the house to order, and introduced the Hon. Edwin P. Mor
row who was received with great applause, and not until some ten
minutes was he able to get in a word; men and women stood on
chairs and cheered this Kentucky's favorite son. He, in one of
his masterly flights of oratory, held his audience breathlessly with
admiration and applause until In. closed with the words: "Fellow
citizens, I now introduce to you the next President of the United
States" Then it was that wild pandemonium reigned for more than
fifteen minutes, Mr. Hughes stood patiently and waited for the
great applause to cease, then with that courteous bow, he began,
what to everyone was the most masterly speech ever delivered in
Kentucky. He was not antagonistic: but he took up the issues of
the day and discussed them with great skill and ability. He took up
the Mexican policy of President Wilson, and made it so plain "that
a fool though a wayfaring man" could not help but to see that the
blunders of Wilson are many. He also took up tho protective
tarilf question, and proved to the minds of the sober thinking man
both Democrat and Republican, that this 'country cannot be run
upon a tariff for revenue only. At the conclusion of his speech
he went directly to his train and speeded his way toward Cin
cinnati, Ohio.
The crowd was so large that the big auditorium would not begin
to hold the crowd, so while Mr. Hughes was delivering his speech
in the auditorium, Mr. Yerkes and Mr. Morrow were addressing a
much larger crowd in the Park just behind the auditorium.
It is strange to note that the Democratic newspapers of tho
country, are awfully afraid that Mr. Hughes will ruin the Repub-
ican party. Well what business is it to a Democrat if he does rum
it? The Courier Journal, in the column under the title "The Latest"
says: "The most part of the delegation was from the Mountains
and that they had their way paid." We deny that statement. We
know most of the men from the Eleventh. While many were there
from tho Eleventh, each and every man of them paid their own
way. The people from the Mountains do not have to have their
way paid to attend a Republican gathering: they don't have to
have money to got them to go to the polls and vote. They arc
thrifty men; they all huvo money; they arc from the richest por
tion of tho State; all thoy want, uil thuy need and all they demand
in to be liberated from the throea of tho Democratic party.

V
Washington, Sept. 5. (Special
Corresp'wdence) "Civilized man
cannot live without cooks," and
the evolution of civilization has
given us enamel ware kitchen
utensils. It was the -imbition of
Henry IV of France to see every
peasant have a chicken in the
pot. A decadent Democratic
party in this country and in this
age would substitute hominy for
chicken, boiled in a pot made in
Europe, and that party stands
for a trade policy which would
reduce American laborers to the
peasant class.
Thirty companies employing
13,000 laborers are engaged in
the production of enamel-ware in
New York. Pennsyhania, West
Virginia, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana,
Wisconsin, Missouri, and Mary
land, and the capital invested
amounts to about $2(,000,000.
Under the rrnrh'o tariff policy
the indutir. s.io..eu largely in
creased wages, and a decrease in
the cost of the products averag
ing 50 per cent.
A large percentage of the cost
of producing enamelware is paid
to labor, and the wages paid in
huropean countries exporting
this class of goods show the
foreign late to be from 25 to 40
per cent of the rates paid in this
country. For instance: An
nealers receive from $13 to $22
more per week here than in
Germany; picklers $11 to $13;
dippers $10 to $15; burners $13
to $20; and burners helpers $9 to
$13 more than paid in the Ger
man industry.
All foreign countries have pro
tective duties on this product,
save Great Britain, which will
return to the piotective policy
after the war. These rates range
from 3 1 per cent, in France and
Italy, to SI per cent, in Russia.
When the enamelware makers of
this country appeared before the
Ways and Means Committee of
Congress, they presented forci
ble arcrumonts for n rntontion of
Advire I the Republican duty rate of 40
oer cent, but the Democrats
The best way to give good ad-' made a 3S nor cent !ash m the
rate, or reduced it from 10 per
cent to 25 per cent. They said a
decrease in the duties would so
increase the imports that con
siderably more revenue would be
realized b the Federal Treasury.
