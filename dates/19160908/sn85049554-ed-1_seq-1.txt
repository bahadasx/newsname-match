CONCUSSION KILLS SOLDIERS.
Many Germans Dead or Killed at
Guillemont Without Wounds.
London, Sept.' 8.—Describing the ef
fects of the British bombardment of
German positions at Guillemont, the
correspondent of Reuter's Telegram
Company at British headquarters in
France says:
"The ground east of the village was
strewn with German dead, in many
cases stark naked, every stitch of
clothing having been blasted off. A large
portion showed no sign of wounds and
the men undoubtedly were killed by
the Intense concussion. In the dug
outs those who escaped alive said
their nerves were destroyed by fcho
terrific pounding of the British guns."
The correspondent considers it sig
nificant that the ground won was not
bombarded by the German field guns,
which would Indicate that the Teutons
withdrew their guns out of range.
Whether this was so that the guna
might not fall into British hands, or
whether for a general withdrawal is
a matter only for speculation.

MARSHALLTOWN, IOWA, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1916.
Pet tit's story is an intimation that his
mother-in-law sowed in his weak mind
the seeds of suspiolon that led to the
murder.
It appears from his statement that
when Pettlt, who was married during
the last summer, dwelt on his notion
of a high spiritual companionship as
a sole means of salvation his mother
in-law had urged him that a normal
marital relationship would bring more
happiness. From this, he said, he drew
a conclusion that his wife—a good,
pure girl—might be won from him, and
so "to save her" he killed her.
In the confession to the state's at
torney Pettlt said that when he was
married in the early summer he ex
pected to live with his wtfe on a
"spiritual plane." Then he went on to
say that his mother-in-law had hinted
to him that If he Intended to continue
on that theory, his wife might seek the
company of others. From that time on
he had the "attacks," or jealous fits, in
one of which he cut the throat of his
•wife and left her lying dead, while he
fled from the house.
Pettit also disclosed that he had
sought to kill himself oi the farm near
Detroit, where he was captured, and
where he had obtained a razor belong
ing to a menrtber of the family there,
and that he yet hoped to end his life
so he could join his bride "spiritually."
In his confession he said he never
had one of the attacks of insanity or
whatever uncontrollable feeling it was
that led him to kill his wife until after
their marriage. This feeling was one
that impelled him to kill her and him
self, he said.

"the corn-
growing belt was disclosed today in the
September crop report of the depart
ment of agriculture. In Oklahoma und
Kansas much of the crop has been cut
for ensilage and fodder. Reduction of
the corn crop In northwestern Arkan
sas, southwestern Missouri aiki other
States has been caused by unfavorable
weather. Much, of the principal corn
area of the country has failed to receive
sufficient rainfall at the most critical
periods of its growth. Frost caused
slight damage In extreme northern Min
nesota.
In North Dakota corn will be mostly
out of danger from frost by Sept. 12
and in some localities of South Dakota
it already is Iteyond danger of frost
damage, but in other parts of that state
four or five days yet are needed. The
earliest corn is well dented in Iowa and
is now safe from frost but 50 per cent
of that state's crop will need until Sept.
28. The first killing frost in Iowa aver
ages Sept. 25 in the northwest to Oct.
5 in the extreme southeast. Corn is
ripening in southern states and is being
harvested in Georgia and Oklahoma.
Harvesting of spring wheat, oats and
barley continues along the northern
border of the country, as well as the
Rocky Mountain states. Threshing is
well under way under favorable condi
tions in the central ^nd well into the
northern districts. In Oregon spring
wheat yields are better than was ex

Washington, Sept. 8.—In a statement

The president's statement follows:
"A very remarkable session of con

believe that It is the purpose of the
leaders of the two houses in the next
