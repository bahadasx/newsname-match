WILSON
IHD
OF 111
Receives Senator James and
Committee at Shadow Lawn.
ACCEPTS WITH GRATITUDE
President lets Forth "Failures" ef Re
publicans and Achievements ef
Democrats Defends His For
eign and Mexican Policies.
Long Branch, S. J, Sept. 2. Presi
dent Wilson received tixlsjr at Shadow
Lawn, the summer White House, the
formal notification of his rennmlnatlon
by the Democratic party frnra the noti
fication committee beaded by Seuator
OUIe James.
In response Mr. Wilson spoke la
part aa follows:
Senator James, Gentlemen of the
Notification Committee, Fellow Citi
zens : I cannot accept the leadership
and responsibility which the National
Democratic contention has again, In
such generous laMilou, asked me to
accept without first expressing my
profound gratitude to the party for
the trust It reposes In me after four
years of fiery trial In the midst of af
fairs of unprecedented difficulty, anil
the keen sense of added responsibility
with which this honor fills (I had al
most said burdens) roe as I think of
the great Issues of national life and
policy Involved In the present and Im
mediate future conduct of our govern
ment I shall seek, as I have always
nought, to Justify the extraordinary
confidence thus reposed In me by striv
ing to purge my heart and purpose of
every personal and of every mislead
ing party motive and devoting every
energy I have to the service of the na
tion as a whole, praying that I may
continue to have the counsel and sup
port of all forward-looking men at ev
ery turn of the difficult business.
For I do not doubt that the people
ef the United Status will wish the
Democratic party to continue In con
trol of the government. They are not
In the habit of rejecting those who
nave actually served them for those
who are making doubtful and conjec
tural promises of service. Least of
all are they likely to substitute those
who promised to render them particn
lar services and proved false to that
promise for those who have actually
rendered those very services.
Republican "Failures" Cited.
The Republican party was put out
of power because of failure, practical
failure and moral failure; because It
had served special Interests and not
the country at large; because, under
the leadership of Its preferred and es
tablished guides, of those who still
make Its choices, It hud lost touch
with the thoughts and the needs of the
nation and was living In a past age
and under a fixed illusion, the Illusion
of greatness. It hud framed tariff
laws based upon a fear of foreign
trade, a fundamental doubt as to
American skill, enterprise, and capa
city, und a very tender regard for the
profitable privileges of those who had
gained control of domestic markets
and domestic credits ; and yet had eu
ected antitrust lawa which bumpered
the very things they meant to foster,
which were stiff and Inelastic, and lu
part unintelligible. It had permitted
the country throughout the long period
of Its control to stagger from one
financial crisis to another under the
operation of a national banking law
of Its own framing which made strin
gency und panic certain and the con
trol of the larger business operations
of the country by the bankers of a
few reserve centers Inevitable; bud
made as If It meant to reform the law
but had faint-heartedly fulled In the
attempt, because It could not bring It
aelf to do the one thing necessary to
make the reform genuine and effec
tual, namely, breuk up the control of
small groups of bankers. It had been
oblivious, or Indifferent, to the fact
thut the farmers, upon whom the conn
try depends for Its food and In the
last ttuulysls for Its prosperity, were
without standing In the matter of
commercial credit, without the protec
tion of standards in their market
transactions, and without systematic
knowledge of the markets themselves
that the laborers of the country, the
great army of men who man the In
dustries It was professing to father
and promote, carried their labor as a
mere commodity to market, were sub
ject to restraint by novel and drastic
process In the courts, were without us
surance of compensation for Industrial
accidents, without federal assistance
In accommodating labor disputes, and
without national aid or advice In find
Ing the places and the Industries In
which their labor was most needed
The country hud no national system
of road construction and development,
Little intelligent attention was paid
to the army, and not enough to the
navy. The other republics of America
distrusted us, because they found that
we thought first of the profits of
American Investors and only as an af
terthought of impartial Justice and
helpful friendship. Its policy was pro
vincial In all things; Its purposes were
out of harmony with the temper and
purpose of the people and the timely
development of the nation's Interests.
So things stood when the Democrat
ic party came Into power. How do
they stand now? Alike In the domes
tic field and In the wide field of the
commerce of the world, American bust-
and Ufa and Industry have been
inn
net free to move aa they never
before.

By the federal reserve act the sup

from the liquid assets of dally trade.
Effective mensures have been tuken
for the re-creation of an American

The Interstate romim-rce roiiiinls-

it to perform Its great and important
functions mure promptly und more ef

For the farmers of the country we
have virtually crea;el commercial
credit, by means of the federal reserve
act and the rural credits art. They
now have the standing of other busi
ness men In the money market. We
have successfully regulated specula
tion In "futures" end established
standards In the marketing of grains.
By an Intelligent warehouse act we
have assisted to make the standard
cropa available as never before both
for systematic marketing and aa a
security for loans from the hanks.
For Labor and Children.
The worklugmen of America have
been given a veritable emancipation
rjy tne legal recognition of a mans
labor as psrt of his life, and not a
mere marketable commodity; by ex
empting labor organisations from proc
esses of the courts which treated their
members like fractional parts of mobs
and not Hke accessible and responsl
blu Individuals; by releasing our sea
men from Involuntary servitude; by
making adequate provision for com
pensatlon for Industrial accidents; by
providing suitable machinery for me
diation and conciliation In Industrial
disputes; and by putting the federal
department of Labor at the disposal of
the worklngman when In search of
work.
We have effected the emancipation
of the children of the country by re
leasing them from hurtful labor. We
hove Instituted a system of national
aid In the building of highroads such
as the country hat been feeling after
for a century. We have sought to
equalize taxation by means of an
equitable Income tax. We have taken
the steps that ought to have been
taken at the outset to open up the re
sources of Alaska. We have pro
vlded for national defense upon ti
scale never before seriously proposed
upon the responsibility of un entire
political party. We have driven the
tvrlff lobby from cover and obliged it
to substitute solid argument for pri
vate Influence.
Foreign Policy 6tated.
In foreign affairs we have been
guided by principles clearly con
ceived und consistently lived up to,
Perhaps they have not been fully com
prehended because they have hitherto
governed International affairs only In
theory, not In practice. They are slm
pie, obvious, easily stated, and funda
mental to American Ideals,
We have been neutral not only be.
cause It was the fixed and traditional
policy of the United States to stand
aloof from the politics of Europe and
because we had no part either of ac
tlon or of policy In the Influences which
brought on the present war, but ulso
because It was mnnlfestly our duty to
prevent, If It were possible, the Indefl
nlte extension of the fires of hate and
desolation kindled by that terrible con
flict and seek to serve mankind by re
serving our strength and our resources
for the anxious and difficult days of
restoration and healing which must
follow, when peace 'will have to build
Its house anew.
The rights of our own citizen of
course became Involved; that was In
evitable. Where they did this was our
guiding principle: that property right
can be vindicated by claims for dam
ages when the war Is over, and no mod
em nation can decline to arbitrate
such claims; but the fundamental
rights of humanity cuunot be. The loss
of life Is Irreparable. Neither can dl
rect violations of a nation's sovereign
ty await vindication In suits for O.am
ages.
Aa to Mexico.
While Europe was at war our ow
continent, one of our own neighbors,
was shaken by revolution. In that
matter, too, principle was plain and It
was imperative that we should live up
to It If we were to deserve the trust of
any real partisan of the right as free
men see It We have professed to be
lieve, and we do believe, that the peo
ple of amall and weak states have the
right to expect to be dealt with exact
ly aa the people of big and powerful
states would be. We have acted upon
that principle In dealing with the peo
ple of Mexico.
Oar recent nejreeJt ef bandits tan)
Mexican territory waa ae viola Bee el
that principle. We ventured to enter
Meilr-en territory only because there
were no military force In Mexico that
could protect ear border from hostile
attack and our own people from vio
lence, and we have committed there
uo single art of hostility or Interfer
ence even with the sovereign authority
of the republic of Mexico herself.
Many serious nrrongs sgalnst the
proierty. many Irreparable wrongs
gainst the persona, of Americans bsve
been committed Unto the territory of
Mexico herself during this coafuaed
revolution, wrongs which could not be
effectually checked so long as there
whs no constituted power la Mexico
which was In a position to check theto.
We could not act directly In that mat
ter ourselves without denying Mexi
cans the right to any revolution at all
which disturbed us and making tho
emancipation of ber own people await
our own Interest and convenience.
Problems ef Near Future.
The future, the Immediate future.
will bring us squarely fa'-e to face with
many great and exacting problems
which will search us through and
through whether we be stile sud ready
o play the part la the world that we
mean to piny.
There must be a Just and settled
peace, and we here lu America must
contribute the full force of our en
thusiasm and of our authority as a
nation to the organisation of that
peace upon world wide foundations
that cannot easily be sbnkeu. No us
tión should be forced to take aides la
any quarrel In which Its own honor
and integrity aud the fortunes of Ita
own people are not Involved; but no
nation can any longer remain neutral
as against sny willful dlsturbsuce of
the peace of the world.
One of the contributions we must
make to the world's peace Is this:
We must see to It that the people In
our Insular possessions are treated
In their own lauds as we would treat
them here, aud make the rule of the
United States mean the ssme thing
everywhere the same Justice, the
sume consideration for the essential
rights of men.
Besides contributing our ungrudg
lug moral and practical support to the
establishment of peace throughout the
world we must actively and Intelli
gently prepare ourselves to do our full
service In the trade and Industry
which are to sustain and develop the
life of the nations In the days to come.
We have already been provident In
this great matter and supplied our
selves with the Instrumentalities ot
prompt adjustment. We hsve crested.
In the federal trade commission, a
means of Inquiry and of accommnda
tlon In the field of commerce which
ought both to co-ordinate the enter
prises of our traders and manufac
turers and to remove the barrier of
misunderstanding and of a too tech
nical Interpretation of the law. In
the new tariff commission w have
added another Instrumentality of ob
servation and adjustment w hich prom
ises to be immediately serviceable
We have already formulated and
agreed upon a policy of law which
will explicitly remove the baa now
supposed to rest upon co-operation
amongst our exporters In seeking and
securing their proper plsce In the
markets of the world. The field will
be free, the Instrumentalities at hand.
At home also we must see to It that
the men who plan and develop and di
rect our business enterprises shall en
joy definite and settled conditions of
law, n policy accommodated to the
freest progress. We have set the Just
and necessary limits. We have put
all kinds of unfair competition under
the ban and penalty of the law. We
have barred monopoly, Tlit-se fatal
and ugly things being excluded, we
must now quicken action and faclll
tate enterprise by every Jus means
within our choice. There will be
peace In the business world, and, with
peace; revived conftdeueo and life
We ought both to husbnnd and to
develop our natural resources, our
mines, our forests, our water power,
I wish we could huve made mor prog
ress than we huve made In this vital
matter.
We must hearten und quicken the
spirit and efficiency of labor through
out our whole Industrial system by
everywhere and in all occupations do
ing Justice to the laborer, not only by
paying a living wage, hut also by
making all the conditions that sur
round labor what they ought to be,
We must co-ordinate the railway
systems of the country for nstloual
use, and must facilitate and promote
tbelr development with a view to that
co-ordination and to their better
adaptation as a whole to the life and
trade and defense of the nation. The
life and industry of the country can
be free and uubampered only If these
arteries ore open, efficient, and com
plete.
Thus shall we stand rendy to mee
the future as circumstance and inter
national policy effect their unfolding,
whether the change come slowly or
come fast and without preface.
