LAMAR, MO., LAWYER KILLS
HIMSELF WITH GUN!
Body of E. L Kazee Found on Porch
. of Vacant House from Which
Shot Was Heard. '
Lamar, Mo., Sept. 6. The body of
Elias L. Kazee, twice prosecuting at
torney for Barton county, was found
early this afternoon on the, porch of a
vacant brick house here. He had
committed suicide by shooting himself
in the head with a revolver. He evi
dently had been dead several hours.
Ill health is believed to have been
the cause of his suicide, according to
friends. Mr. Kazee was convalescing
from an attack of typhoid fever.
It is believed that Mr. Kazee went
to the house at 10 o'clock this morning,
as persons in the neighborhood heard
a revolver shot about that time.
Persons passing the house saw Ka
zee lying on the porch, but believed he
was resting. . Curiosity eventually
caused an investigation.
L ' ilr. Kazee was prosecuting attorney
mBarton county two terms, from 1910
rto 1914. Three years ago he is said
to have inherited a fortune of $50,000.
He was active in civic affairs here
and was widely known. He had lived
here fourteen years.
He is survived by his wife and
three children, two sons and a daugh
ter. No inquest will be held, "as the
coroner's investigation resulted in a
oV-lon that Kazee had killed himself.
Funeral services will be held at the
home Friday.

"A breeder of ne Guernseys wished

liked to drive them that far in hot
weather.
"By using a three-ton motor truck
he moved them all sae.y :n one t'ay,

been suspected that young Rogers had golia and South Manchuria,

since late in July. Young Rogers is as follows:
twenty-five years old. 1. Punishment of the commanding
On the 4th of August Roy Rogers
obtained $25 at the Stark City bank
! by presenting a letter purporting to be

there to the credit of hig unce About
a week later Rov tried to draw
on the same account through a bank
at Independence. The bank phoned
to Cashier Waldo Hatler at Stark City,
who asked the Independence bank to
cause the negro's arrest. This was
done and Rogers was brought to Neo
sho. When he was searched it was
found that he had his uncle's pass
book and check book from the Stark
City bank and a check book from one
of the Fairview banks; also $600 in
notes belonging to his uncle.
By this time suspicions had been
aroused over the disappearance of the
elder Rogers. His relatives at New
tonia knew nothing of him. The offi
cers at Independence were informed of
these things and they began searching
for the body of the missing man on
the theory that he had been killed.
Tuesday the body was found. There
was a wound at the back of the head,
which indicated he had been struck a
heavy blow, and it seems certain that
the body had been buried in the ravine
where found.
The inquest at Independence was
held Wednesday. As soon as the
officers there can get requisition pa
pers they will take Rogers there for
trial. The officers there think they
have a clear case against him.
Rogers was tried Monday before
Justice Leroy Moore for getting the
$25 by fraud, but was dismissed. He
was immediately rearrested and re
turned to jail that he might not get
away until the developments in Kan
sas were known.
Rogers was raised near Newtonia,
and his father lives there now.
The murdered uncle was a bachelor,
about forty-five years old. He owned
a farm and was a prosperous, indus
trious negro.
When informed that the body of
his uncle had been found, young Rog
ers claimed ignorance of the whole
matter. He has been saying that his
uncle went to New York City to an
other job and that he left the papers
in his care. Neosho Daily Democrat,

WHAT THE JAPANESE SEEK.
Want China' to Grant Four Demands
and Four "Concessions."
Washington, Sept. 6. Sweeping deT
mands, far more delicate than any
published summaries have indicated,
are revealed in the secret terms being
pressed on China by Japan as a result
0f the recent armed conflict between
: t i. .e i.1 a i.' a yM

Chinese officer involved in the trouble.
2. Dismissal, with punishment, of
the other officers involved. ,
3. Instructions to Chinese troops in
Inner Mongolia and South Manchuria
not to interfere in any way with Jap
anese troops or civilians and to pub
lish this fact broadly.
4. Recognition of "special inter
ests" for Japan in Inner Mongolia and
South Manchuria, comprising powers
of police and administration, prefer -
ence in loans and the selection of all
foreign advisers, etc.
Besides the four "demands" are four
"concessions" which China is asked to
grant Japan without formal demand,
as follows:
1. The Chinese army in South
Manchuria and Eastern Mongolia to
employ Japanese military advisers.
2. Chinese schools and colleges to
have Japanese military inspectors.
This is not limited to any section in
dispatches so far received.
3. A formal apology in person
from the Chinese governor of Mukden
to the Japanese governor at Dairen
and the Japanese consul at Mukden
for the Cheng Chiatun trouble.
4. Monetary compensation to the
families of the Japanese killed, the'
amounts to be settled by later nego-
tiations.
Secretary Lansing refused tonight
to comment on the dispatches or to
outline what might be the attitude of
the American government.

TOWN OF BOLIVAR SHAKEN
BY DYNAMITE EXPLOSIONS
Machinery of Road District Destroyed
and Other Damage Done, An
Investigation Started.
Springfield, Sept. 7. Road machin-;
ery belonging to the Bolivar 8-mfle
special road district, valued at ap
proximately $2000, was blown to
pieces, a privately owned tractor val
ued at $1000 was badly damaged and
hundeds of winodws throughout the
town of Bolivar were shattered in two
terriffic explosions shortly after mid
night yesterday morning, according to
word brought to Springfield yesterday
by residents of the Polk county town.
Three hundred pounds of dynamite
were set off in the two explosions.
The explosions are believed to have
been set off with malicious intent by
enemies of the commissioners of the
Bolivar special road district. Men
employed by the commissioners re
cently went on a strike for higher
wages and were granted on increase
amounting to about 20 per cent. A
number of men employed in road con
struction were discharged within the
past few days and one of the theories
advanced by residents of Bolivar is .
that the explosions were the direct
outgrowth of the labor trouble.
The explosions occurred about a
quarter of a mile east of the public
square of Bolivar and within two
blocks of the home of Mark Upton,
chairman of the Bolivar 8-mile road
commission. Hundreds of windows
in various parts of town were shat
tered and residents hurried into the
streets to learn the cause of the ex
plosions. An investigation has been
started and arrests are expected.
MRS. RICHMOND TEEL DEAD.
Rev. T..J. Brattin received a mes
sage Sunday morning, stating that
Mrs. Richmond Teel of the New Site
locality, near Monett, died at an eari
hour that morning. He conducted
