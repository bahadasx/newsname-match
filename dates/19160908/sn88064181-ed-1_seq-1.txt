By WILLIAM A. RADFORD.
Mr. William A. Radford will answer
questions and give advice FREE OF
COST'r on all subjects pertaining to the
uubject of bulldl: ;, for the readers of this
paper. On account of his wide experience
as Editor, Author and Manufacturer, he
is, without doubt. the highest authority
on all these subjects. Address all inquiries
to William A. Ratdford, No. 1827 Prairlo
avenue, Chicago, .Ill., and only enclose
two-cent stamp for reply.
There are few pedple who do not de
sire an air of coziness in their bome-
that suggestion of snugness which
seems a part of the little bungllow
and extends an Invitation to all who
pass by to come into the little home
where corforts are provided In every
nook and corner. This quality seems
to be always associated with a small
idome, and those who must have a
larger house are often led to discard
their desire in this direction and cen
ter their attention on arrangement of
rooms only. .
In .the illustration shown here a
house is pictured which has every ap

sign is an exceptional one from every
standpoint.
The sides of the house are finished
with alternate wide and narrow rows
of beveled siding, having fancy panel
work set up under the gables. The
porch rail is built up from the ground
line with rough brick, capped with an
overhanging ledge of brick turned up

rail up to the roof, and these are
capped, in balance with the rail, by a
single course of brick on edge. The
outside-built chimney, in carrying out
the idea established in the porch de

The roof has a graceful slope, which
is swung out over the porch in a
troad curve. The wide expanse of
roof is broken by the formers, whirh

unique touch is added in the use of'
heavy exposed purlins, built up of
three lengths of tillber, under the
rafters of )loth the mauin roof and the
dormer roofts.

at the end of the room to the left of
this entrance. In the corner of the
house next to the fireplace is a handy
bookcase built beneath a fancy glass
window. A larger window is situated
on the other side of the fireplace The
dining room is entered through a
cased opening flanked with bookcases.
A three-window bay is built into the
wall of the dining room and a buffet is
set against the inside wall. The room
is a square, which is the best shape
for a dining room, since there is plenty
of space on all sides of the table
when it is placed in the center of the
room. The kitchen is in the rear of
the dining room and may be entered
through a swinging door.
The ability of the architect is ably
illustrated In the arrangement of the
kitchen. Every convenience of a light
and airy kitchen, a carefully plunne.d
pantry and a breakfast porch are
here combined in one room. A table
In which the sink is set runs along
the side wall. with a window above it.
One cupboard is located conveniently
across the dividing wall between the
kitchen and the dining room. and an
other is built into the outside corner
above the space occupied by the re
frigerator. Across the room is a little
breakfast-nook table with a seat built
on each side. This little table will
save many steps in serving breakfast
and will commend itself in many other
ways. There is aunple room for a
stove against the inside wall.
Another feature which will find fa
vor with most people is the hedroom
and toilet on the first floor, These
rooms are entered from a hall leading
toward the rear of the house, past the
stair, trom the living room. This hall
is also connected with a side entry by
a flight of four steps. The basement
is reached from this entry.
There are two large bedrooms and
a sleeping porch, which is really an

A description of the modern city of
Lemberg as it existed in August, 1914,
requires many modifications today, for
the scars of war are to be found in Its
many handsome homes; its broad, well
paved streets; its Roman Catholic
cathedral, a handsome gothic structure
completed in 1480; its Greek cathedral,
completed in 1779; its Armenian
cathedral in the Byzantine style, dat
ing back to 143t, and its magnificent
monuments to such Polish patriots as
King John. III Sobieski who, atter
having saved Lemberg from the Alrks
a few years previously, In 1683 saved
all Europe from Mohammedan inva
sion by routing an army of 300.000
Turks encamped about Vienna, his own
force numbering only 70,000.
Nearly 700 Years Old.
Called Lwow in the Polish tongue
and Leopolis in Latin, Lemberg was
founded by a Ruthenian prince in 1250.
Nearly a hundred years later It was
added to the domain of Casimir the
Great, who bestowed upon the city
the charter and privileges widely
known during the middle ages as the
Magdehurg [tight.
Following the fall of Constantinople,
Lenm,rg enjoyed a revival of trade
with the East, but it was caught in the
mnelstrom of rebellion and pillage
which swept over the Ukraine anst ai
part of Poland during the last half of
the seventeenth century, when the Cos
s'ck hetman, Chmlelnicka, was direct
ing the infumnies of the "serfs' fury."
Lemberg was one of the Polish cities
to faull before the arms of Charles XII
of Sweden when the ill-advised Au
uhtstus 11 was drawn Into the Great
Northern war, which devastated cen
tral Europe for the first 20 years :if the
eighteenth century. In 1772, upon the

';Brody a Commercial Center.
".0 Oabout two miles beyond the
lusstan border, the Gallcian town of
B 4ldy is a point of great strategic im
portance on the eastern war front be
cause it controls an important railway
Ithe leading from Dubno, 35 miles to
thi northeast, to Lemberg, which is
only 62 miles to the southwest.
At the beginning of the world war
Brody was a thriving commercial cen
r with 'a population approaching 20,
more than two-thirds of whom
t-prosperity was checked
1, after having enjoyed the -
leges' of a free commercial city for
exactly 100 years. its charter was with
drawn.
. Less than half a century before
Brody was created a town in the sev
enteenth century it was the scene of
an important battle in which the Poles,
commanded by their famous grand
hetman, Stanislaus Ponieckpolski, de
feated a Tartar army. This was the
last battle of Ponleckpolski's als
tinguished career. For a quarter of a
century he was at war with Turks and
Swedes, his initiation in military
science being somewhat disastrous, for
lie was captured by the Turks in his
first important engagement and was
held in close confinement 'for three
years at Constantinople. Upon his re
lease in 1662 he was placed in com
mand of the Polish republic's forces
and with a force of 25,000 defeated 60,
000 Tartars at Martynow. His achieve
ments against the army of Gustavus
Adolphus were no less noteworthy than
his long series of victories whereby he
succeeded In keeping the Ukraine un
der Polish rule.
Brody twice suffered from disas
trous conflagrations during the nine
teenth century. The first, occurring
in 1801, destroyed 1,500 houses, while
the fire of 1859 reduced 1,000 honies
and business establishments to ashes.
The upper waters of the Styr river
form an irregular are extending from
the southwest to the north of Brody,
being ten miles distant at its nearest
point, toward the northwest. Five
miles from the city, just beyond the
border on the Dubno-Lemberg railway,
is the Russian town of Itadziwilow,
with a population of about 8,000.
The Log Line.
The log line is one of the older de
vices for measuring the velocity of a
ship. The log is flat is made so that
it will floaut perpendicularly. To this
a line is fastened, called the log line.
The approximate speed of the ship can
be determined by letting the line run
off for, say, half a minute. The length
of the line run off in that time gives
a basis for calculating the speed per
hour. The log, during the experiment.
remains stationary on the surface of
the water, of course. This is the older
method. A modern method involves
the use of a log with a revolving
mechanism which is dragged along in
the water behind the vessel.
A Horrible Accident.
A popular sportsman. eing vastly
conceited about his fine ngure, wore
corsets to show it off. ()ne day he
was thrown from his horse and lay
pirone on the road. A farm laborer
ran to render him assistance. Tho
first-aid man began to feel the fallen
one all over to see if any Iolnes hap
pe:ed to be broken, and suddienly
yelled out to another laborer:
"'Itun. Jack, for heaven's sake, for
a doctor. Here's a man's ribs runnin'
north and south, instead o' east and
west"
The Stream
of Power
Bu GENEVIEVE LEE
(Copyright, Lil, by W. U. Chapman.j
Mnxs Bulger w\as ki;owin to the well
advised in metropolitan businless cir
cles as "a shark." Lie had capital corn
ing, g ing, doubling, trebling, and called
!t "the stream of power." Within its
depths he lurked, ready to pounce on
any unwary victim who trusted to Its
treacherous course. Into the stream
he lured fair but unsuspecting craft
-and generally scuttled them.
His only living relative seemed to
be Bliss Porter, just out of college and
headed for a legal career. The young
man had barely heard of this sordid
half-uncle until he was amazed, In
another city, struggling along indiffer
ently, to receive a check for five hun
dred dollars from his relative, crisply
ordering himn to close up his affairs and
come to Chicago.
"I am going to leave my fortune to
you," was the blunt startling an
nouncement of old Max, "provided you
learn my business and carry it on
where I leave it off."
This seemed promising, but, at the
end of a week, after his esteetned
relative had shown him "the ropes,"
Bliss Porter was disgusted. The
precious ways of the shark, the tricks,
the traps, the preversions amazed and
then shocked him. He saw deluded
business men in need of money place
themselves totally in the power of a
heartless, devouring monster. He
saw a family disrupted through the
harsh measures employed in collect
Ing an overdue obligation. Max Bul
ger cared only for his pound of flesh.
It mattered little to him that his ex
acting extortions were at the cost of
all his victim possessed.
pt hisr~e hs oney, I
w-ouldn't a opt- lVu WutbAs, .
if he gave me a million I" dcided
Porter. "I shall tell him so today
and end the farce."
They were out in the Bulger auto
mobile that afternoon and Bliss was
waiting till they got away from the
crowded business center to deliver his
ultimatum. A Jam of vehicles blocked
them near the curb at one place. Di
rectly within reaching distance stood
a thin threadbare old man. lie put
out his hand for alias to the passers
by. Porter's generous nature was
touched by his forlorn friendliness.
He took a dollar bill from his pocket,
leaned out of the machine and placed
it in the hands of the old man.
"Oh. I thank you, sir," began the
mendicant, and then his eye chanced
to fall upon Bulger. The latter
shrank, cringed. Into the face of the
old man there had come a fearful
rage, yet, withal, tempered with a
certain dignity. He drew himself up
to his full height. He tore the bank
note into a hundred pieces. He
leaned over and flung them squarely
into the face of the cowering Bulger.
"You and your brood I" he shout
ed out, "I would starve ere I took
charity from such," and then, the cu
rious crowd surging about him, he
screamed out a frightful arraignment
of itulger. He accused him of ex
tortion, of ruining his business life.
of driving him to beggary. The few
words fell like burning hot missiles,
and, as thile automobile started up,
Bulger gasped faintly:
"I am ll-get me Ihome at once."
He was, Indeed, Ill, for he never got
over the shock of the fearful :nath
emas buried upon his guilty head. It
seemed to Bliss that day and night
after that the old mendicant haunted
Bulger. T'he latter gave up his blood
money traffic, but would awaken In
his sleep shrieking out the name of
robert Lane. Hlie sought respite In a
new sphere of money-mad excitement,
gambling on the stock exchnange, be.
enme a fleecer, fleeced and losing most
nf his fortune in wild specultiotn.
Then he died with the name of Itob
ert Lane upon his tortured lips and
Bliss was his heir.
The young man was Infinitely Ir.I
pressed by the episode that had
Irought to ',ulger his doom. When
the e(state camine finally into his hands.
he found that it had dwindled to less
than fifty thousand dollars.
"It is tainted wealth." he told hin
self. "There is only one course, res
tituthmi. Then for my old. humble, I
.rcotented life with a lesson, I shall
never forget."
Bliss went all over the private pa
hers of his half-uncle, lie linally
unearthed the Robert lane transnae
tion. It was a flagrant case. Getting
Iane into his clutches, Bulger had
iystenmatically robbed him. He had I
exizedi the home and business of the
merchant and absorbed it for a com-a
parattively small debt. When he came
to tigure up the frightful sacrifice
and injustice that had beggared Lane,
se was apnpalled. I
