EDITOR'S OBSERVATIONS.
Mason City to the Negroes ten
years ago was unknown and unheard
of, but now we have a colored popu
lation of 250, a beautiful new A. M. E.
church, one good Masonic lodge, one
chapter of Eastern Star, one K. of P.
lodge, one Knights of Tabor and
Daughters of Tabernacle, each doing
well two barber shopB, one shoe shin
ing parlor, three expressmen, one
chiropodist and several gardeners and
farmers. Mr. John D. Reeler, one of
the early pioneers in this city, who has
been a' resident for fully twenty-five
years, lived in Des Moines and until
recently run a fine tonsorial shop, has
now opened a chiropodist office in the
National Bank building and is doing
well. He owns a beautiful home. Ye
editor enjoyed a nice dinner while
here with Mr. and Mrs. Reeler. Hor

tractors, are still here and doing a big
business. They are good, active
young men and have won their way
among the best white people in this

Henry Sims is an influential citizen.
A. L. Renix is still working at the
same place. He owns a beautiful
home. Mr. T. Davis Is still running
his shining parlor and is doing well.
He has a nice home and his amiable
wife and children make the home life
pleasant. Mr. Davis formerly lived
in Ottumwa. Virgil Wairen is still
employed by the Mason City Bottling
Works. Virgil is very popular among
the employes. We think that he can
make more pop in one day than ye
editor can drink in one year. G. W.
Edwards is doing well. Also W.
Smith. J. T. Bass runs a barber shop
and is making good. R. Wi Brown is

much credit for push and energy. She
has won the respect of the best white
citizens here. L. E. Banning, L. W.
Tyler and A. Leggins are all doing
well. Mr. M. Pease is a railroad
brakeman for the Chicago, Milwaukee

of. Thos. Allen, formerly of Des
5'Moines, is Tunning a rooming house
and restaurant.
Our next stop was in Waterloo.
Here what we said about Mason City
ten years ago we can repeat that only
five years ago there were only two
colored families living here. In fact
it was once printed in the papers that
colored people were not allowed to
come to this town nor were not want
ed, but ROW fully 350 are living here.
They have two churches, a new A. M.
E. church built by Rev. A. Bess, called
Bess Chapel, and a Baptist organiza

house formerly owned by the city, pas

came a little unpleasant in their

arrangement for company and no way
to fix on such a short notice, so they
set in to thinking and looking on every
car for the guests. Later in the after

with everything to eat, cakes, pifeSi
chicken, served spareribs, hot biscuits^
