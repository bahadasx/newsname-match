BRODHEAD
The Boone Way grade between
here and Mount Vernon will be
completed by the time thisappeais
in print, those who have never
goue over it will be astonished to
see that the once rough, rugged
and steep hills are no more, and
that the numerous rocks that
once paved the way are lost from
sight. Win. Mullius, who has
charge of the work, is the right '
man on the job and knows just'
how to make a road The people
of Brodhead and vicinity were
very much elated when the news
came to us that Mr. Mullius
wculd continue grading toward
Crab Orcbaid, knowing that with
in two or three weeks that he
would make hills and dales dis
appear, and connect with the
splendid grade made by our
Lincoln friends. We certainly
hope that this good work will
continue and that we will be able
to show Lincoln County that
we are wilLng to meet them in
all their laudable undertakings.
Nothing is better to our lil'ing
than to see our boys on the road
to Mt Vernon with their auto
mobiles daily, and to know that
the two towns once so Jar apart
are now within twenty minutes
drive of each othr. If the coun
ty offic:als are looking for praise
for the eood road work they are
doing they should connect the
grade with Lincoln County and
and every man , woiiiau and
child will do them honor A

says that he could buy a 24-pound
sack of flour tnere for 1.40, good
beef steak for 30 cents a pound
and other things in proportion.
We are surprised that a man that
knows a good thing when he sees
it, like Uncle John does, would
have left a place where be could
have lived with as little expense
as in Charleston; but Brodhead is
known the world over as the best
town on the map and that is why
Uncle John is back at home we
guess. Mr. I.R. Stormsreceived
news Wednesday that a daughter
in London was seriously ill, and
that she was not expected to live

A MEMENTO.
The Christian Church Sunday
School of Mt. Vernon, in session
assembled, desire; to express its
appreciation ot the worth and
character of Professor J- S.Irvine
and its sense of the great loss it
has sustained on account of his
removal from among us.
For three years Professor Ir
vine has been at the head of the
Public Schools of our town. Dur
ing that time we learned to love
him. He was a most untiring effi
cient and successful teacher, a
devoted member of the Church
and Sunday School, alwas found
at his post of duty, ever ready,
zealously and unselfishly, to do
with a will what his hands found
to do
We most cordially and earn
estly recommend him to the
good people among whom his lot
is to be cast as a man worthy of
every confidence, and above all
he is an upright Christian Gentle
man. To him and his we extend
our most sincere good wishes
and benediction.

Iu his address at Shadow Lawn,
Loug Branch. N. J., accepting the
Democratic nomination for Mesideut.
"Woodiow "Wilsou said:
Senator James, Gentlemen of the Noti
fication Committee, Fellow Citizens:
I canuot accept the leadership and re
sponsibility which the national Dein
ofnilic 1 onvention has again iu such
v ii'i.ius fashion asked me to accept
witim. t l.-,t expi csing my profound
g.:it i.do 1 the party for the trust it
reposes i 1 ..1 uftor lour years of fiery
trial iu the midst of affairs of unpre
cedented difficulty, and the keen sense
of added responsibility with which this
honor fills tl had almost said burdens)
me as I think of the great issues of
national life aud policy involved in the
present and immediate future conduct
of our government. I shall seek, as I
have always sought, to justify the ex
traordinary confident e thus reposed in
me by striving to purge my heart and
purpose of eVery personal and 0 every
misleading party motive and cfevoting
every energy I have to the set vice of
the nation as a whole, prayiuj, that I
may continue to have the counsel and
support of all forward looking men
at every turn of the dilRcult business.
For I do not doubt that the people
of the United States will wish the
Democratic party to continue- In con
trol of the government. They are not
in the habit of rejecting tho-e who
have actually served them for those
who are making doubtful and con
jectural promises of service. Least of
all are they likely to substitute those
who promised to render them particu
lar services ai.d proved false to that
piomise for those who have a tually
'n? ;?:, -1 t!o:t ry !" 1 vi '
Boasting is always an empty busi
uess, which pleases nobody but the
boaster, and I have no disposition to
boast of what the Democratic party
has accomplished. It has merely done
its duty. It has merely fulfilled Its ex
plicit promises. But there can be no
violation of good taste in calling at
tention to the manner in which thoe
promises have been carried out or in
adverting to the interesting fact that
many of the things accomplished were
what the opposition party had again
and again promised to do, but had left
undone. Indeed, that is manifestly
part of the business of this year of
reckoning aud assessment. There is
no means of judging the future excepl
by assessing the past. Constructive
action must be weighed against de
structive comment aud reaction. The
Democrats either have or have not un
derstood the varied interests of the
country. The test is contained iu the
record.
What is that record? "What were
the Democrats called into power to do?
What things had long waited to bo
done, and how did the Democrats do
them? It is a record of extraordinary
length and variety, rich in elements
of many kinds, but consistent in prin
ciple throughout and susceptible ol
brief recital.
A Record of Failure.
The Republican party was put out
of power because of failure, practical
failure and moral failure; because it
had served special interests and not
the country at largo; because, under
the leadership of its preferred and es
tablished guides, nt those who still
make its choices, it had lost touch
with the thoughts aud needs of the
nation and was living in a past age
and under a fixed illusion, the illusion
of greatness. It had framed tariff
laws based upon a fear of foreign
trade, a fundamental doubt as to
American skill, enterprise and capac
ity, and a very tender regard for the
profitable privileges of those who had
gained control of domestic markets
and domestic credits, and yet had en
acted anti-trust laws which hampered
the very things they meant to foster,
which were stiff and inelastic and in
part unintelligible. It had permitted
the country throughout the loug period
of its control to stagger from one finan
cial crisis to another under the opera
tion of a national banking law of Its
own framing which made stringency
and panic certain and the control of
the larger business operations of the
country by the bankers of a few re
serve centers inevitable; had made as
if it meant to reform the law. but had
faint heartedly failed in the attempt,
because it could not bring itself to do
the one thing necessary to make the
reform genuine and effectual namely,
break up the control of small groups of
bankers. It had been oblivious or In
different to the fact that the farmers,

its food and in the last analysis for
its prosperits. weie without' standing

So tilings stood when the Democratic
party came into power. How do they
stand now? Alike in the domestic field
and In the wide field of the commerce
of the world, American business and
life and industry have been set free
to nw e as they never moved before.
The tariif has been levised, not on
the principle of repelling foreign trade,
but ui on the principle of encouraging
it, upon fomethiug like a footing of
equality with our own in respect of
the terms nf competition, .ind a tariff
board has l.een cre..v i w '1. se function
It will !e to kce;i the i jlations of
American "with fori-",; u li dness aud
industry under '-on ;nt i iservation,
for the guidance ali'..e of o.r business
men and of ou. congress. American
energies are now directed toward the
markets of the world.
The laws against trusts have been
clarified by definition, with a view to
making it plain that they were not
directed against big business, but only
against unfair business and the pre
tense of competition where there was
none, and a trade commission has been
created with powers of guidance and
accommodation which have relieved
business men of unfounded fears and
set them upon the road of hopeful and
confident enterprise.
By the federal reserve act the sup
ply of currency at the disposal of ac
tive business has been rendered elas
tic, taking its volume not from a fix
ed body of investment securities, but
from the liquid assets of daily trade,
and these assets are assessed and ac
cepted not by distant groups of bank
ers in control of unavailable reserves
but by liankor? t the u-: y vn'crs
of local exchange who are in touch
with local conditions everywhere.
Effective measures have been taken
for the re-creation of an American mer
chant marine and the revival of the
American carrying trade indispensable
to our emancipation from the control
which foreigners have so long exer
cised over the opportunities, the routes
and the methods of our commerce with
other countries.
The interstate commerce commission
has been reorganized to enable it to
perform its great and important func
tions more promptly and more efilcieut
Iy. We have created, extended and im
proed the service of the parcels post
So much we have done for business.
What other party has understood the
task so well or executed it so intelli
gently and energetically? What other
party has attempted it at all? The Re
publican leaders, apparently, know of
no means of assisting business but
"protection." IIow to btimulate it and
put it upon a new footing of energy
and enterprise they have not suggested.
Farmers Have Been Benefited.
For the fanners of the country we
have virtually created commercial
credit by means of the federal reserve
act and the rural credits act. They
now have the standing of other busi
ness men in the money market. We
have successfully regulated speculation
in "futures" and established standards
in the marketing of grains. By an in
telligent warehouse act we have assist
ed to make the standard crops avalla
ble as never before both for systematic
marketing and as a security for loans
from the banks. We have greatly
added to the work of neighborhood
demonstration on the farm itself of
improved methods of cultivation and.
through the intelligent extension of the
functions of the department of agricul
ture, have made it possible for the
farmer to learn systematically where
his best markets are and how to get at
them.
The workingmen of America have
been given a veritable emancipation
by the legal recognition of a man's la
bor as part of his life and not a mere
marketable commodity, by exempting
labor organizations from processes of
the courts which treated their mem
bers like fractional parts of mobs and
not like accessible and responsible in
dividuals, by releasing our seamen
from involuntary servitude, by making
adequate provision for compensation
for industrial accidents, by providing
suitable machinery for mediation and
conciliation In industrial disputes and
by putting the federal department of
labor at the disposal of the working
man when in search of work.
We have effected the emancipation
of the children of the country by re
leasing them from hurtful labor. We
have instituted a system of national
aid in the building of highroads such
as the country has been feeling after
for a century. We have sought to
equalize taxation by means of an equi
table Income tax. We have taken the
steps that ought to have been taken at
the outset to open up the resources of
Alaska. We have provided for na
tional defense upon a scale never be
fore seriously proposed upon the re
sponsibility of an entire political par-
