ROPING CONTEST
Carlond of Four-Year-ld AVild Mex
ican Steers That Never Saw a Ropo
Will Furnish IVfcany a Thrill for
Spectators and Ropers.
Local cowpunchers and roping ex
perts will have the time of their lives
at the Fair this year, when thero will
bo turned loose for them to ropo and
tie, a bunch of raw Mexican steers,
four years old that never saw a ropo
In tholr lives, and- that are as wild
as a steer ever gets to be.
M. I. Holland and R. B. Lemon,
who are engineering this stunt, havo
gone Into South Texas and bought a
carload of this stock and are ship
ping the crlttoro hero especially for
tho Fair. Bob Lemon says that for
real Inborn meanness thees steers are
as bad as they ever get to bo. Each
day thoro will bo free-for-all roping
contests with prlzos of $100, $50
and $25, respectively, for tho quick
est, second and third qulckost time
at roping and tying a steer. ' This
makes $525 In promlums the throe
days-for this event alone, which the
promoters say well bo worth mor3
than the money.
10c JITNEY RATE
TO FAIR GROUND
Council Passed Such an Ordinance
Tuesday Night, and Indulged in
Further Rucus Over Suspension of
City Firemen, Too.
The city council in session Tues
day night passed an ordinance pro
vidlng for a 10-cont jitney car fare
from town to tho Fair grounds dur
ing tho Fair, to take the place of the
old 25-cent faro In vogue heretofore,
which insures people being able to
ride to the Fair grounds and back,
instead of walking through the dust.
It was thought that the forced 10-
cont fare might result in no cars
offering their services, but others
contended that tho Increased volume
of hauling that would result would
moan cheaper rides for tho public,
and moro profits for the jitneys 13
well.
The old rucus regarding tho sus
pension of Fire Chief Hubor and As
sistant Chief Yager, was revived.
Mayor Yarbrough suspended those
officials several weeks ago, but the
counqll in special session orderu'l
them reinstated. Tho conflict of au
thority thus shown did not make the

relations any too cordial In tho city
hall, and the mayor played his trump
card, that of refusing to sign the pay
warrants of Messrs. Hubor and Ya
ger. Tho upshot of tho row at Tues
day's session was that the council or
dered E. C. Terrell, as president of
'o council, to sign tho warrants, In
viow of the mayor's refusal. At the
tlmo this item was written, no action
had been takon, nnd the question ns
to whether such signature would con
stitute a legal warrant was being investigated.
Tho council spent tho remaining
timo of an almost .all-night session
at regular routine business, allowing
bills and so on.
NEW OIL IWLL MANAGER
TO. Bongo, formerly manneor nf
