LOWER FAIR FOREST
POUNDS PASTOR
I
On Saturday, Sept. 2, while at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Scaife Wilburn's,
about 8 p. m., several young <
people came in. We had beei informed
that there was going to be
a singing at Mr. Wilburn's. They began
singing in a few minutes and the
people kept coming. We noticed that
several older people had dropped in
but did not suspicion anything.
About 9 o'clock we were invited into
the dining room. We found the room
decorated and crowded with people.
We were then informed that Lower
Fair Forest church and Sunday school
were "pounding" their pastor. The
pastor was so surprised that he did not
know what to do or say; however, he
managed to get his thoughts together
enough to speak a few words of at)preciation
and to offer a prayer of
thanks to God. After prayer J. F.
Ttir.hop delivered an address in behalf
of the church and Sunday school io
the pastor, informing him of their kind
feelings towards him and his family;
saying, that they had done what they
had to show their love and appreci.t
i:on ior tnem.
The "pounding' 'was a very heavy
one and was composed of all kind* of
good things to eat. We certainly 1>
appreciate this kind 5jct and pray th 4
blessings of God to rest upon every
one. We thank you again and again.
Mr. and Mrs. J. M. Trogdon.

HUGE ZEPPEL
T
BREVARD WOMAN FOUND
DEAD WITH PISTOL IN IIANU
Mrs. C. M. Gallimore, of a Notable
Family, Suicides?Body Found in
Clump of Weeds.
Brevard, N. CM Sept. 5.?Lying ir
a clump of weeds, with a pistol still
clutched in her fast stiffening hand
Mrs. C. M. Gallimore, 60 years of age,
and one of the prominent women o.
Brevard and Transylvania county,
was found dead yesterday afternoon,
She had been shot through the
mouth, the bullet penetrating the
'brain and killing her instantly. The
verdict of the coroner's jury was
suicide.
Rev. A. W. McDaniel, pastor of the
Brevard Baptist church, who had
called to pay a social call, and Mrs,
Corn, who lived in the house with
Mrs. Gallimore, found the body. When
the pastor called, he was met at the
front door by Mrs. Corn, who stated
that Mrs. Gallimore had been present
but a short time before. She volunteered
to find the missing woman,
and the pastor accompanied her.
After an unsuccessful search in the
: ;nity of the house and yard, the
minister and his companion, widened
ir circle of search, and finally
found the dead woman lying in a
clump of weeds a short distance from
the house, where she had evidently
concealed herself before taking the
fatal step.
CAROLINA LADS MAY
APPEAR IN MOVIES
Photoplay With Theda Bara as Star
Likely to Be Filmed on the
Border.
In Camp with the South Carolina
Troops in the El Paso Patrol District,
Sept. fi.?South Carolina soldiers who
are now encamped along the border
may have the opportunity of seeing
Theda Bra, the "Vampire of the
Screen,' 'in person and taking part
with her in a thrilling screen production.
Whether the soldiers will take
part or not has not yet been definitely
decided but there is every probability
that they will.
i. Theda Bara. it is said, is to l>e
heroine in a play which will be filmed
in this section along the R:o Grand?.
The production is to be staged by the
Fox Film Corporation and will set
forth scenes on the border, raids by
puesdo bandits, and a reproduction of
conditions as they are and they might
be under war conditions. The picture
people wanted to stage this along the
Rio Grande between El Paso and
Juarez, and have mimic battles along
the river, but Gen. Bell is said to have
.1 i: i A - -ii * * - * * 1 *
| uvcuneu 10 anow mis maKe-oeueve
fighting carried on at the boundary
for the Mexicans might mistake it
for the real thing and trouble will result.
Now it is said the movie people
will jro up alonfr the Rio Grande between
Texas and New Mexico, and all
in American territory and removed
from the border, and pull off the fightintr
there. One man who is assisting
in fretting the location and paraphernalia
for the actors and actresses said
that the Pennsylvania and South Carolina
troops would be asked to take
nart in the make-believe fighting and
be filmed in a very important part of
the play.
Likely to Take Part.
Unless the commanders object, and
it is not supposed that they will, the
Palmetto boys, will undoubtedly like
very well to be movie actors with
Theda, for the star and some of them
don't care how many times they and
Theda will appear together in the same
scenes.
A part of this picture, it is sate,
will depict the Mexican bandits and
the Mexican women and children, and
already 100 Mexican saddles have been
secured for the use of those who will
impersonate the men of the trouble
nation to the south.
Of course, the movie people would
like to use actual border territory,
but everyone realizes the wisdom of
the authorities in declining this privilege
for the situation is such that it
might result in real trouble.
A Mr. McNairy, who owns a nip
ranch up in New Mexico on the Ric
Grande, said that the movie people
wanted to stage the picture on his possessions
and would probably do so,
This Mr. McNairy has become a great
favorite among the South Carolinians
for he solicited business for the Fi/st
National Bank of K1 Paso, of which
his brother is cashier, and in thi way
he met a great many of the men from
the Palmetto State. It i>- possible
that a number of the South Carolinians
will witness the filming of this
ni-tiire. Several houses for the movie
nronle to burn in the course of taking
their picture will have to be built on
Mr. McNairy's ranch and :n ell it will
be very interesting to see the actual
making of one of the movie films.

home after spending three weeks with
his cousins at Clinton and Newberry

INS
0 CARRY MAIL
, To Fly Across Ocean?"Double"
Airships, Unarmed, to Make
Berlin-New York Trip in
Seventy-two Hours.
Chicago, Sept. (?.?Two "double"
Zeppelins, unarmed and each with a
carrying capacity of sixty tons, have
been built in Germany to carry
' mail between Berlin and the Unit id
j States, according to a statement iieic
\ by Morris Epstein, agent of the Ger,
man-American alliance, who returned
, from Europe yestetrday.
Epstein said the Zeppelin had been
, christened Amerika and Deutsch11
land. He was permitted to view
them, he declared. Their engines are
1 powerfully e<|uipped and they can
make the aerial voyage between Ber,
lin and Nw York in 72 hours.
"They are so constructed," said
Epstein, "That they can rise higher
than any aeroplane and thus escape
hostile aviators. They also can des end
to the water and travel there
, under their own power."
Epstein said the postage charges
for this service had already been arranged
and would be the regular international
postage plus one mark, or
25 cents for each letter.
PUT COTTON^ PRICE
AT TWELVE CENTS
FARMERS' UNION PRESIDENTS
FIX THAT AS MINIMUM.
Discuss Arrangements for Handling
oi .>outn s .Money Crop
on a Sound Basis.
New Orleans, La., Sept. 6.?The annual
meeting of the Association of
State Farmers' Union Presidents,
which has just closed here, fixed 12
cents per pound as the minimum price
of cotton and urged that all bankers,
merchants and business interests of
the South cooperate in maintaining y
this price in order that the cotton in- J
dustry of the' South may be placed '
upon a stable basis. Peter Radford 3* of
the Texas warehouse commission
was appointed chairman of the committee
having these matters in charge. - J
Mr. Radford immediately called a
meeting of his committee at Houston
for September 19, and invited leading !
officials of the union in aP cotton
States to attend. The committee will
discuss with the business men of
Houston the warehouse, financial and
shipping facilities with a view of determining
the percentage of the
Southern cotton crop which can b?
stored, financed and handled through
Houston. The organization of the entire
South into marketing units with
farmers' locals as a basis will becin
as soon as suitable men can be put in
the field.
Henry N. Pope was elected president
of the association and I. N. McCallister
of Louisiana, secretary. The union
has State organizations in 13 States,
and President Pope will make a tour
of all States at an early date and the
work of organization will be rapidly
carried out.
