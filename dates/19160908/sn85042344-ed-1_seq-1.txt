SEVERAL DEBATES
MARK DAY SESSION
Some Delegates Want State
Rights First and Some
Want Amendment.
ATLANTIC CITT. N. J., Kept. 7.
After a long debute, which, car
ried the afternoon session of the con
vention well Into the evening, tho
National American Woman Suffrage
association today adopted a platform
outlining its plan of campaign for se
curing the submission of the federal
suffrage amendment to the state leg
islatures for ratification.
It was decided that the next annual
convention In 181 7 be held in March
or "thereabouts." that a lobby be con
tinued at Washington and that the
association conduct a nation-wide
campaign of education, agitation, or
ganization and publicity In support
Of the federal amendment. A mlllion
oollar campaign fund Is to 1)0 raised
between October, this year, and Oc
tober. 1917.
Must Watt for Consent.
Tt was further ngreed by the con
vention that no state association shall
ask the legislature of Its state for the
submission of an amendment or ref
erendum to the peoplo until the na
tional board of the executive council
ef the association shall have been
given the opportunity to Investigate
conditions and give consent. Any
elate organization which proceeds to
such state cumpuigii without consent
must be prepared to finance and con
duct its campaign without help from
the national body. Other steps ulso
re to be taken to standardise and
nationalize the woman suffi'ugo move
ment. ,
The convention got into a tangle
over the method of considering the
platform, many parliamentary moves
being made to postpono Immediate
consideration or to have the numer
ous items in It taken up separately.
Intimations were made that a steam
roller was being used to put the plat
form through tho convention, but In
the end It was adopted without
amendment.
Trlod to Put Off Vote.
Then followed another dobate on
tho resolution of President Carrie
Chapman Catt, presented yesterday,
which Interprets the constitution to
mean that tho submission of the fed
eral amendment is the immcdlnte and
principal work of the association and
that all state work Is merely In pre
paredness to that end. This resolu
tion had been made a special order
for the morning session and was
moved back until this afternoon.
When It did come before the conven
tion Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, former
president, endeavored to have con
sideration again postponed until to
morrow morning.
Some delegates said I lie resolution
was not worth the Taper it was writ
ten on as It could not change the
sense of the association's constitution
and others felt it vitiated the action
of the convention yesterday when it
was decided that the association
Should work for both federal and
state suffrage legislation. Finally
many of the delegates became weary
of the long session and when another
motion was made to postpone consid
eration. It was quickly adopted and
the resolution was fixed for the first
order of the business tomorrow morn
ing. . . . .. .
Many delegates tnnuy eiimuneu
the convention the difficulties of get
..nnu,a rrmatitutlonal amend
ments through the legislatures.
It Was nixie F.vcnhiK.

SAN ANTONIO, Sept. 7. The trans
portation of the First and Second
regiment of Kartsus infantry from
Eagle Pass to San Antonio in motor
trucks was practically completed late
this afternoon when the 132 machines
bearing the two thousand men and
their equipment rolled Into Cnstro-
vllle, 23 mites out of this city. Camp
was pitched there for the night ho that
the troops could arrive In San Antonio
in daylight.
The trip proved such a success that
Col. Harry L. Rogers of the quarter
master's department Is considering
sending some of the northern troops
home in trucks when demobilization
of the national guard on the border
takes place.
The outstanding feature of motor
truck transportation of tho Kansas
troops was Its low cost. It was said
that the expense of the trip was only
about one-third of that which would
have been entailed in railway trans
portation. The long train left Kagle Pass at
12:40 p.m. yesterday and arrived at
Castroville at 4:40 p. m. today. The
distance covered was approximately
160 miles. Camp was pitched 23 miles
southwest of Uvalde last night.
General Funston rode out to meet
the aKnsans as tsey entered Castro
ville. He had a personal Interest, he
said, In the troops from his old state,
and particularly In meeting Col. R. S.
Metcalfe, commander of the Second,
who was a major in the old Twentieth
Kansas during tho Spanish-American
war and the general's successor In Its
command.
"Metcalfe Is a real soldier." said the
general. "He was wounded twice
during the Spanish war."
The two had a cordial meeting as
Colonel Metcalfe's troops were pitch
ing camp.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 7. The
treaty for the purchase from
Denmark of tho Danish West Indies
for 125,000,000 was ratified by the
senato tonight. There was no roll call
and less than a half dozen senators.
Including Senators Norrls, Jones and
Clupp, voted against it.
Favorable action on the treaty at
this session of congress had been
strongly urged by tho administration.
particularly because of the influence
it might have upon the situation in
Denmark, where, though the lower
houso of parliament has approved It,
a fight is being made for ratification
in the upper houso.
But Little Opposition.
The vote tonight followed several
hours of debate in executive session
while the senate was waiting for the
conference report on the emergency
revenue bill, the only obstacle to ad
journment of congress. Finding that
no serious opposition developd, ad
ministration leaders urranged for a
recess from 8:15 to 8:30 o'clock to
round up a quorum und to force finul
action. By mistake adjournment In
stead of a recess was taken, causing
a few minutes delay while the
sergeant-at-urms looked for a minister
to offer the Invocation required under
the rules, but when no minister was

lished by dispensing with the Invoca

Intermittently for half a century. Be
cause of their strategic value, par
ticularly since the construction of the
Panumu canal, the American govern
ment has been anxious to acquire
them, not only with a view to estab
lishing a naval base there, but to
prevent the Islands from falling Into
the hands of any foreign power. Ger
