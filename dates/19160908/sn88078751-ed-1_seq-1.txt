national banks. The vacancies caused

vention, was detained at Washington.
Pomerene's Address.
Mr. Pomerene's speech was devoted
largely to a review of the accomplish
ments of the Wilson administration
and to legislation enacted by con
cress. He upheld the president's Eu
ropean and Mexican policies and
pointed with pride to the enactment
of the Underwood tariff bill, the Clay
ton anti-trust measure, and to legisla
tion creating the federal trade commis
sion, the federal reserve board, tariff
commission, rural credits and for the
establishment of a merchant marine.
Referring to the president's Mexi
can policy, Senator Pomerene said:
"Shall we prove a menace to the
weaker republics to the south of ua,
whose causes we have always chain
pioned? Should we not aid them rath
er than destroy them? Should we put
to the sword a feeble and ignorant
people while they are in the throes of
revolution because they do not and
can not preserve law and order? The
choice is not between right and
wrong; the choice for us to make is
between two evils. What would Can
didate Hughes have done? In his
speech of acceptance, while speaking
of the Mexican situation, he said: 'It
le apparent that we are shockingly
unprepared.' Yes, we were unpre
pared to defend our borders after six
teen years of Republican rule. In one
year the Democratic party has done
more for the defense of our country
than tho Republican party did in six
teen years of Republican rule."
Concerning the administration's for
eign policy Mr. Pomerene said: "Pres
ident Wilson has gone to the limits
of diplomacy both with Germany and
Great Britain, and In most Instances
they have conceded the correctness of
Us position. Mr. Roosevelt says he
Uronld substitute 'deeds' for 'words.'
"What' deeds? War? Who In this
great nation, except the few who are
always thinking of the glory of self,
rather than the interests of the pub
lic, would even think of suggesting
war? And if we had declared war,
where was the navy and the army
which would have been sufficient to
cope with either Great Brjtaln or Ger
many? "Who is there that would have Join
ed tho allies In a war against Germany
for the Jinking- of tho Lusitanla and
the Pussex, with tho consequent de
struction of American lives, after she
bad conceded her wrong and promised
Indemnity? Who Is there who would
have declared wnr against Great Bri
tain and France, though they have

we had wanted to 'declare war, would
it ha-e been wise to do no In view of
our tate-ot unpreparedness after so
manv year'of Republican u.le?"
Mr Pomerene, "In conclusion, refer
red t' the use of money ,ln elections.

FRESH GAINS MADE
BY FRENCH TROOPS
Germans Admit Losses In the
Somme Seder,
London, Sept 7. The French south
of the Somme river drove their men
farther into the German lines for new
gains.
In stubborn fighting over a front of
four miles between Vermandovlllers
and Chilly, the Germans have been
forced to give up the northern por
tion of Vermandovillers, while the
French have occupied the outskirts
of the railway junction town of Chaul
nes and thrown their forces along fie
railway running from Chaulnes to
Roye between Chaulnes and Chilly.
To the north the operations of the
French with Barleux and ultimately
Peronne as their objective, also met
with success. Southeast of Belloy-En-Santerre
more German trenches were
captured and most of the village of
Berny-En-Santerre fell into French
hands. Berlin admits the loss of Clery,
which lies a short distance northwest
of Perron e.
In Galicia. on the front of the Zlota
Llpa and Dniester rivers, the Rus
sians have driven the Teutonic allies
from fortified positions and have tak
en 4,500 prisoners, among them about
2,000 Germans. Berlin concedes a vic
tory to the Russians in this region.
Violent fighting continues around
Brzezany, southeast of Lemburg, but
here Berlin says the Russians have
suffered heavy losses and have made
no advance. Russian attacks near
Zborow, northern Galicia, and in Vol
hynia, also failed, according to Ber
lin. Fighting is still going on in the
Carpathians where the Russians
claim the capture ot additional
heights.
In the Roumanian theater, German
and Bulgarian troops are still engaged
with the Roumanians in the Dobrudja
region. Berlin reports the capture of
seven of the Tutrakan works, together
with their armored batteries. The
Roumanians claim that they have re
taken all the Dobrudja frontier east
of the Danube between Bulgaria and
Roumania. The towns of Islacx and
Kalafat, on the Danube, have been
bombarded by the Teutons.

Owen Corrupt Practices Measure

bate In the Senate Exchanges Oc

Owen and Others Proceed
ings of Congress.
Washington, Sept. 7. Plans of ad
ministration leaders to adjourn con
gress tonight were abandoned when,
the conference committee on the
emergency revenue bill Indicated that
it had not reached an agreement.
The revenue bill, however, Is not all
that is delaying adjournment. In the
Et-nate a filibuster developed against
the passage of the corrupt practices
act, and various senators are clamor
ing for consideration of minor bills.
The general deficiency bill still is be
ing held up in conference until a re
port on the revenue measure has been
made. and. in addition to these obsta
Ices, leaders of both houses expect
that general debate on the revenue
hill conference report will occupy
many hours.
Administrative features of the in
come tax provisions are the stumbling
block in the revenue bill. They had
settled the rate oftaxation, however,
and agreed finally that the normal
tax on incomes should be 2 per cent
and that the senate amendments in
creasing the sur taxes on large in
comes should be retained in the bill.
Consideration of the senate amend
ments empon ering the president to re
taliate against British interference)
with American trade and American
mails had been discussed informally
In conference. There was no disposi
tion to eliminate any of the provisions
which have aroused diplomatic repre
sentatives of the allied powers in
Washington.
Elimination of all stamp taxes in
the emergency revenue bill, seriously
objected to by the house, was agreed
upon by the conference committee.
Hot Debate In Senate.
While the senate was waiting on tho
revenue bill conferees, the Owen cor
rupt practices bill was taken up and
made a vehicle for several hours of
acrimonious political debate.
The vote to take up the bill was 32
to 14, nine Republicans voting with
the majority In favor of the measure
and seven Democrats voting against
it. Ths bill would restrict campaign
expenditures of candidates for the
senate, the house and for the presi
dency and vice presidency to a great
er extent than the existing law.
Senator Curtis argued that such a
measure passed when the campaign is
half over might work unfairly against
men who have already spent the stipu
lated amount. He advocated a mora
stringent law. He read a letter from
Senator Ashurst to a constituent, re
citing his record as a basis for sup
port, and said he understood that 70,
000 of these had been sent out, in vio
lation of the privilege.
"If the senator charges that this in
a violation of the law," said Senator
Ashurst, when he got the floor, "he
has sweetbreads for brains." Ho ex
plained that his letter had been sub
mitted and approved by the postmas
ter general.
A little later Mr. Ashurst turned on
Senator Penrose, who said he had no
ticed a "copper lobby" around tha
capltol, whose members had been
talking with the Arizona senator. "If."
said Mr. Ashurst, "he means to say
that my vote has been influenced by
a copper lobby or other lobby, he lies."
Several senators objected to this lan
guage and Senator Ashurst agreed to
withdraw his remarlc
Senator Owen said former Con
gressman Mitchell Palmer had stated
that $750,000 was spent in one Penn
sylvania election. Senator Penrose,
in answer, said that Mr. Palmer's
statement had never been supported
by evidence.
