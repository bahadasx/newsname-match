LEW 111 AIR
Aviator Says There Isn't Enough
to Do While Flying
Aloft i
mm TALES OF IS
"8ll for Hours Without Putting s
Hand on Lever," 8ays One-
Clouds Most Deadly Things
They Have to Fsar,
London. The hardest part about
flying In wur Is the thinking that a
flying man has to do. ' Here's the Idea
In an English flying man's own words:.
"There Isn't enough to keep a mun's
mind busy in the uir since the wat
bus developed the acropluue. In the
old days of the ueroplane there were
so aiuny tldugs a Hying niua had to -watch
that he didn't huve time to wor
ry about what might huppen to him..
But In these days sitting In your ma
clrine Is about like sitting on a log
and waiting for something to huppen.
"We dou't have to use our bauds
as we used to. There Is only one lev
er, and you don't have to watch that
very closely. You can fly for hours
without having your hand on It You,
cun write or rcud or smoko, and tin-'
less you touch the lever to change Its
position you will fly along at the same
level lndi'Iinlti'ly owing to the sulf
atublllzatlon of the machine.
Look Down; Watch Shells.
"So, with your attention only mildly
occupied, you keep looking down over'
the edge to see what's happening. You
get to watchiug the wires and wonder-
lug what would happen if a bullet cut
one of them. You look at the frail
irons and consider how frail they real
ly are. Bhrapucl Is breaking below
you and around you, perhaps. That's
a dully occurrence. There's no use
of trying to dodge It for by doing so
you may only run Into it
"So there you sit imagining all sorts
of horrible possibilities. You've been
told to go to a certain place and then
return. Your route is all laid out for
you and your duties are so simple and
easy that while you're performing
them you have a thousand times too
much spurs time for thought aud wor
ry. As for niyBelf, I'd much rather
Have the aeroplane a less simple af
fair, Just to have my attention occu
pied. An imagination la a curse to a
flier,"
And then there's the problem ot the
whirling compass.
An airman flies into a cloud; sud
denly the finger of his compuss be
gins to whirl around like a clock
gone mad. Scientists say it doesn't
whirl, but so many English airmen
have had the experience that even
the scientific men are wondering
whether the phenomenon Isn't worth,
studying. .
The Whirling Compass.
- Here's a flying mun's side of It :
"My compass fluger has whirled like
a top when I have gone into- a cloud.
It's enough to turn you doraente.L
It's bad enouch. soodness knows, to
be lost in a cloud, but to huve your
compass go back on you at the same
time is too much. Our scientific In
structors tell us that the compass
doesn't change but that We lose our
heads when we get into the uilxt aud
change our courses without realizing
it so that the compass Indicator
changes naturally. , ;
"But In some clouds your compass
doesn t change, it remains as sieuujr
as it was la the sunshine. Why should
a filer Jiggle his course unknowingly
In one cloud and not in another? My
opinion is that there are certain klndt
of clouds that are charged with elec
tricity. In such clouds your compass
goes crazy. In other words, whera
electricity is not present your compua
behaves Itself."
How tar are the clouds above the
VttlMl
As high above as we wish to climb.
But the chief question wita a flyiu
lima 1 how low' the clouds arc, A
crack English flier told the correspond
ent something about low clouils. -'
"Xou may be walking along the
street on a heavy day utitl, looking up,
may think that the clonus are uiili-s
high. As a matter of fact they may be
only 200 or 300 feet above you. That's
