VOTE FOR GEORGE OLNEY
Democratic Voters in Navajo
County can make no mistake in
voting for the nomination of
Olney next Tuesday.
Next Tuesday a primary elec
tion will be held in every pre
cmct in Arizona ior the purpose
of placing in nomination candi
dates for the various state and
county offices. It is the duty of
every voter in the state, man
and woman, to go to the polls
and cast a ballot for the candi
dates deemed most competent to
fill the offices to which they
aspire. The direct primaries
were arranged so that every vot
er could have a voice in the
selection of the candidates who
will be voted for at the general
election. And if every voter
does his and her duty the best
neoDle will be nominated next
Tuesday.
In Navajo county there are
but few contests in the two great
political parties for offices.
Where these contests exist, the
candidates contesting are pro
bably equally well qualified and
no serious mistake would be
made in voting for either. How
ever, there is a bitter contest in
the democratic party for the
highest office in the state, that
of governor. For nomination to
this office there are two candi
datesGovernor Hunt, the pre
sent incumbent, and George
Olney, a prominent business man
of Phoenix.
The News believes that the
best interests of the entire state
will be subserved by the nomina
tion, and subsequent election of
Mr. Olney. There is nothing in
the record of Governor Hunt
that entitles him to the support
of the voters throughout, the
state, and especially to the sup
port of the voters in Navajo and
Apache counties. His record
during the two terms he has ser
ved as chief executive of Ari
zona has shown no special act of
ability, and no marked inclina
tion to serve the whole people.
Rather, this record shows that
he has sought to stir up strife
between capital and labor, and
that he has allowed personal
bias to shape many of his official
acts.
The claim is being made by
Hunt supporters that the voters
in Navajo and Apache counties
owe allegiance to the governor
because of his efforts to secure
an appropriation by the last le
gislature for flood sufferers in
these two counties. As a matter
pf fact Senator Fred T. Colter of
Apache county, and Representa
tive Sam Proctor qf Navajo coun?
ty are responsible for this favor
able legislation. To be sure
Governor Hunt signed the relief
bill passed by the general as
sembly, and a few weeks ago he
came up here to assist the local
people in deciding upon the dis
tribution of the money appro
priated. But this trip was not
made until more than a year
after the money had become
available, and only a few days
after Mr. Olney had announced
his candidacy for governor.
Could the latter fact have had
anything to do with the govern
qr's visit? M.ore than likely, for
Governor Hunt is said by those
who know him best never to
overlook an opportunity to fur
ther his own political interests.
And he doubtless figured it good
politics to help in the distribu
tion of money to the people of
Navajo and Apache counties. He
has not explained why he forgot
the matter for more than a year,
and only thought of it when he
realized he would need some yot
es in the primaries from these
two counties.
There are manv other argu
ments which might be advanced
in favor pf the nomination of
Olney as against Hunt. Some
of these arguments are concisely
summed up in a communication
trom Hon. Q. R. Gardner, one of
Navajo county's best known and
most highly respected citizens.
This communication was written
to the editor of The News by
Mr. Gardner in answer to a re
quest for a brief statement as to
why he favored the nomination
of Mr. Olney. The letter fol
lows: "Dear Sir: There are many
reasons why I am for Olney but
the one which seems to me to be
the strongest is this: It appears
to me that the democratic party
is badly divided. The labor or
ganizations on the one hand and
business on the other, and I be
lieve Olney to be the man to
unite and cement the party
again.
'As I understand it. he came
into the territory when but a
boy, started in as a common
laborer and came up step by step
through rank and file, receiving
hard knocks and much experi
ence in public lire: coming in
time to be stockman, farmer,
businessman and investor.
I believe in organized labor
and the regulation and control of
capital, but a square deal for all
parties. I have been on the
frontier all my life. My father
came west in 1851 and into Ari
zona in 1877, and I have, bent my
back in the heat of an Arizona
sun and my hands are hard with
abor. I know what Arizona has
cost in blood and tears and toil,
and I know what it has been to
men who have invested money,
and while labor should be en
couraged and protected, invest
ments should also receive the
same consideration and Isincere-
y believe Olney to be the man
best qualified by his mental atti
tude and long training to do the
right thing by all the people,
thus, uniting the eood old Demo
cratic Party again.
Sincerely yours,
Q. R. Gardner,"
Embargo on Freight Lifted
Last Saturday morning J. M.
Lee, local agent for the Santa
Fe, received telegraphic advices
to lift the embargo on shipments
of freight. This embargo had
been placed upon the shipment
of livestock and other freight, in
anticipation of a tieup of traffic
in the event of the strike of rail
way trainmen which had been
ordered for Monday morning.
The order to resume all kinds
of freight shipments followed
the issuance of an order by the
hfour brotherhoods of railway
trainmen to call off the proposed
strike. This order was issued
by the heads of the brotherhoods
as soon as it became certain that
congress would pass the 8-hour
law, which President Wilson
caused to be introduced and rush
ed to passage.
The 8-hour law, known as the
Adamson law, passed at the re
quest of President Wiison in or
der that the strike of trainmen
might be averted, is claimed by
the the railway managers to be
unconstitutional. Even though
it should be so decided by the
supreme court, its passage ser
ved a good purpose. The rail
road strike was averted and the
country was saved, if only tem
porarily, from a serious disaster.
Both parties to the controversy
will have time to reconsider the
situation and such reconsidera
tion should result in an amicable
adjustment of the differences
between the managers and the
trainmen.
