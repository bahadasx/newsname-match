I POLLY'S COLONIAL TEA
By IZ0LA FORRESTER.
Eusebla had lived In the little gam-brel-roof
house at the foot of the hill
ever since she wd3 born, for forty
eight years.
Gabriel always stopped when he
drove by on the way to town to call
out a cheery salute to the face at the
sitting-room window. He had gone to
school to Miss Gibbons, and really had
afi affection for the odd little old
maid.
"You know, Gabo," she would say,
with a certain tilt of her head, "I am
tlld las, of the Gibbonses."
Gabriel fGUlerobered the plaintive
note of loneliness the' 6&y ha carried
the load of hard wood ovef to tha
Bchoolhouse. The teacher stepped
out to show him where she wanted It
put, and she asked him if he knew a
nice, pleasant place to board. She
wits' lif ittft down near the station, and
didn't like It.

tember 18, to 23. A number of
the communities in the dry
fanning districts have notified
the fair management that they
would bring exhibits to the fair.
The exhibits themselves while
valuable and interesting are not
so impoitant as the fact that all
the people are co-oj erating in
this fair to make it a credit to
all eaetf-rn New Mexico

completed arrangements with

management feels that this fair
will have an unusually strong

hoped that thes? men will also

Gabriel told her he'd speak to Miss
Gibbons. She couldn't have been a
duy over eighteen, with big brown
eye and wavy brown hair nd the
deepest dimples.
"8he don't seem to have much sta
bility," said Miss Gibbons gently, aft
er she bad boarded Polly a week.
"She just seems to brighten up the
whole place. I'm even thinking some
of having i little party for her Wash
ington's birthday. i'n set out all my
colonial things, ask each one who
comes to bring along dmething
they've got tucked away, too. You
can come, can't you, Gabe?"
Gabe was sure he could. In fact,
he'd make a point of it- But when he
paid his usual call Sunday, Polly
seemed out of.umor.
"Oh, It Isn't anything, Gabe," she
said shortly. "It's JuBt everything all
at once. I think I'll give up the .
school and go back home. I heard
Mrs. Dwlggins say Friday they would
ask for my resignation if I didn't.
"First, they say the supervisor
drives over and stays too long In my
district. Well, tie does, too. He's an
old goose. Then they say I waved
my hand to the mall carrier." She
smiled dellclously.
The twilight had fallen. Miss Gib
bons was busy getting tea out In the
kitchen, and Gabe some way managed
to unburden bin mind to a large ex
tent in those few minutes. But the
next day, even Eusebla sensed some
thing wrong In the atmosphere at her
Washington tea.
All about the parlor and sitting:
room were Eusebia'a colonial treas
ures, her moss-rose tea set and the
silver glaze teapot. There were the
Capitol steps silk quilt made by GreatJ
grand-aunt Luclnda Allen, and the old
flintlock miifcfcet that had gone through
the Pequot Indian wars, with a Revo
lutionary powder born next It, and
homespun woolen blanket that old
Capt. Ethan Gibbons had wrapped
around hla weary limbs at Valley
Forge. There was a slender silver
cup the great general himself wa
said to havo drunk from and the very
split bottom chair he had sat In the
night of his sojourn at the Gibbous
home. ,
Polly had draped an old worn flag
over the picture of Washington be
hind the tea table where EuBebia sat,
fiuHhed and happy, and the rooms
really looked festive. But there wa
something wrong. Polly knew it right
away, when Mrs. Deacon Rlcketts
gave her a, hand that was like a dead
flounder. Then, when she passed tea,
several of the ladles said very primly.
"Much obliged. Miss Hall, I'm sure."
"Expect to go home before Easter,
do you, Miss liall?" Inquired old Miss
Chatterton, who was deaf as a post.
The qnestlon seemed to reverberate
through the low-celled rooms, and
Polly was pink to her ear tips. But
Eusebla heard It and answered for
her placidly:
"Well, faln't at all likely. We'll
need her here to sing in church, and
it would hardly pay to go way up to
Vermont and back again."
Mrs. Itlcketts coughed slightly,
stirred her tea and fired the next
shot.
"The deacon was saying there wai
some talk on the school board of get
ting a man teacher to look after those
big boys. I should think they'd be a
real burden to you. Miss Hall."
"I like them," said Polly earnestly.
"They all help me with the smaller
ones, and are good as can be."
"I don't believe that' supervisor will
get elected this year again," spoke up
Miss Chatterton, with startling clear
ness, and there came a dead silence.
It really was the psychological mo
ment In Eusebia's tea. Even the fa
mous mistress of the first administra
tion herself would have needed all
her tact and diplomacy In handling
the issue of the moment. Polly flashed
an imploring glance at her, and
Eusebla poured another cup of tea
with steady fingers.
"Do try another one. Miss Rlck
etts," she said. "It'll quiet your .
nerves. Well, I don't wonder they
talk of removing him. Silly old thing,
gallivanting around "stld of attending
to his duties. Polly, Isn't that Gabe
at the door?"
Polly stepped out Into the (ront hall,
and Eusebla smiled confidentially at
her company and sprang her final
shot of victory.
"You know they're engaged to be
married as soon as the school term
ends. I'm real thankful, too. Qabe'i
got a treasure."
