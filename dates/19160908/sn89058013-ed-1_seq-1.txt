The Lord is with you while ye
be with Him; and if ye seek Him,
He will be found of you; bnt if ye
forsakeTIini, He will forsake you.
II Chronicles xv 2. Reader,
don't labor under that false and
delusive idea that when you are
once upon the path of life you can
never again stray. When you for
sake God He will forsake you, so
says our text.
Don't think when once you are
saved from sin that you will re
main thus, unless you cultivate
this gift of life by daily partaking
of the grace that raised you out of
sin and shame, and practicing in
your daily life the principles of
Christianity. God says to every
soul He eaves,
vineyard," and
"Go work in My
Jesus said, "No
man, having put his hand to the
plow, and looking back, is fit for
the kingdom of God." Luke ix 62.
Remember, you must fight the
good fight to a finish. You were a
self-determiniig free agent before
your conversion; you wer8 free to
begin the Christian life or not, as
you choose, and you are, in the
same manner, free to continue this
life or not, just as you may decide.
All the powers of Heaven are
pledged to protect the Christian
who remains true. Romans viii
35-39. But God does not propose
to in keeping with his moral gov
ernment and man's free moral
agency he can not save those who
will not remain true, and who, of
their own free will, forsake the
way of righteousness.
It is not only "he that believeth
shall be saved," but also "he that
endureth to the end shall be saved."
In the first instance he is saved
from sin in this life, and in the lat
ter, saffed eternally in Heaven.

EVERYBODY SEES
A CHANCE
IN FATHER
Farmer Suffered for Over Twenty
Years and Paid Out Thousands.
"My father has suffered from
chronic stomach trouble for over
20 years and has paid out thou
sand of dollars on medicines and
doctors," said G. W. Slayton, a
well-known Cobb County farmer,
who lives near Smyrna, a short
distance out of Atlanta.
"We tried nearly everything try
ing to cure him, aud he went off to
the springs, thinking maybe the
water would help him, but it just
looked like nothiug would reach
his trouble. Then he tried diet
ing, and lived on liquid food until
he almost starved but even that
failed to do any good, and he just
kept goin g from bad to worse.
"I don't guess there ever was a
case as stubborn as his, and if there
ever was a confirmed dyspeptic he
was one of them, and I guess he
would have been one yet if it had
not been for this Tanlac.
"The first we heard of this med
icine was when my father saw an
advertisement in the papers from
parties he knew in Tennessee, who
were friends of his, and he knew
what they said about it was the
truth so he got it right away aud
began taking it.
"Well, sir, it acted just like
magic and everybody notices the
change in father now why, he is
just like a different man, and sits
down to the table and eats like a
farm hand. Only yesterday, he
ate pork and turnips for his din
ner, and ate so much we were actu
ally afraid he was overdoing the
thing, but he laughed and said
nothing hurt him now and that he
was hungry and expected to eat
and make up for lost time.
"Now, when a medicine will do
things like that, I think people
ought to know about it, and I want
to say right now that I would not
give one bottle of Tanlac for all the
other medicines and health resorts
in the country put together."
Tanlac is sold in Camden exclu
sively by the Fry Drug Co.; in Big
Sandy by J. M. Moses; in Big San
dy R. F. D. by W. A. Weldon; in
Faxon by J. S. Davidson; iu Bre

Humphreys County will hold a
fair on court square at Waverly
this fall. Why not hold a county
fair on court square in Camden?
Its rather late to undertake it this
fall, and yet with $50C a creditable
premium list could be arranged.
But talking won't do it. Its takes
money to put on a fair aud make a
success of it. The business men
of Waverly saw the point, and
we are of the opinion they will find
that thoy made a good investment
