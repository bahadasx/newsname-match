"An Interesting Circumstance"
In an editorial in the Boston Tran
script the following comment ap
pears: "A very interesting circumstance
in connection with the Vermont reg
iment is that its colonel, Ira L.
Reeves, was, at the moment of the
assembly of the regiment, being in
stalled as president of Norwich Uni
versity. Norwich has been a military
school from its beginning under old
Captain Partridge, and Colonel
Reeves, who is a retired captain of
the regular army, with a brilliant
record as an officer, will continue
the Norwich tradition of education
mixed with patriotism.
Colonel Reeves will command the
Vermont troops and possibly some
others from now on. In the Ver
mont's composition the military
spirit flows strong and dear side by
side with the civic ideal."

Vermont at the National Dairy
Show.
"Vermont proposes to make an
exhibit of Guernsey cattle in October
at the National Dairy Show that will
be worthy of the special notice it
will attract. This was determined
upon at the meeting in Bradford
last Friday of the Vermont Guern
sey Breeders Association and the de
tails of the plan adopted were sent
to the officers of the show in the
board of trade yesterday afternoon.
The idea will have the support of
the American Guernsey Cattle Club
whose offices are in Peterboro, N. H.
"In order to make the exhibit rep
resentative of the many fine herds
in the state, the state association
will select at least one carload, per
haps two, of the best animals on dif
ferent farms and send them to
SpringfieH in the name of the as
sociation. The rules for the entry
of cattle at the show permit this to
be done, though any animal entered in
competition for prizes must walk
into the show ring in the name of
its actual owner.
"Elbert C. Tenney of Brattleboro,
president of the association, and
Mark H. Moody of Waterbury, sec
retary, have already begun to pick
out tne individuals that will be
brought here. They say their chief
difficulty is going to be in making
the selections from so large a num
ber as is available; every Vermont
farmer who has a few good Guern
seys wants to be represented in the
shipment."

THURSTON
OPPOSED 8-HOUR BILL.
Representative Greene Protest
ed the Passage of the Bill
although in Sympathy
t with the Men.
Representative Frank L. Greene
during the general debate in the
House in opposition to the passage
of the Adamson eight-hour bill made
a vigorous speech. He said in part:
"I am opposed to the passage of
this legislation ht this time. If we
were to have an opportunity to go
into the mei its of the case, if we
were to have an opportunity to ex
ercise something like the same
judicial and magisterial duty toward
the parties to the controversy that
we enjoin upon and demand from
courts that this Congress creates,
then it might not be unlikely that
testimony and evidence so submitted
would convince me that there was
some truth and justice on the side
of the men who demand an eight
hour day.
"We should keep in mind however,
throughout all this discussion as
has been several times intimated
here that this is not a demand for
an eight-hour day which shall limit
the hours of physical labor to eight
hours a day, but it is a demand for
an eight-hour basic pay day, conse
quently placing it on an altogether
different footing. However that
may be, it seems to me that the only
thing that presents itself here to us
today, as men entrusted with the
responsibility of government and as
men upon whose shoulders for the
time being (however unworthy in
dividually we may be), is this: When
any man, or set of men, whether
they be friends.schoolmates, fellows,
companions, trusted confidants, or
kinsmen, hold up the Congress of
the United States and say that they
shall have certain legislation passed
between this hour and Saturday
night or they will bring a national
calamity, bloodshed, suffering .starv
ation, misery and want upon this
land, it is time for somebody to
stand up in the United States and
say that the government of the
United States is greater than any
combination of men under it.
"This principle it seems to me,
confronts us here in this issue, and
it rises pre-eminently above the
mere details of the merits of the
controversy. Instinctively and by
reason of my early surroundings,
from my education and environ
ments, I am in sympathy with men
who are toiling for wage.
I could tell you something about
it if it were not of a neculiarly per
sonal character and had a real bear
ing on this issue. I could possibly
convince you that I am speaking
sincerely when I say that, but I say
today that a3 we stand here facing
this proposition, that the real merits
of this dispute are not involved until
the Congress of the United State
asserts its dignity and self-respect
and refuses to be held up by anybody
at any time, under any threat, or
under duress. Once begun, where
is this surrendering to end? Men
may say under these circumstances
it is necessary to have this emergency
legislation because by doing this un
der pressure and under duress in the
very few hours that remain to us we
will avert a strike, sorrow and blood
shed. Who will be responsible for
the bloodshed and sorrow and want
and privation that may follow be
cause of it? Will we be held re
sponsible for those who set out to
bring about a national calamity on
the land because we do not yield to
them and grant their demands under
terror of threat? Where will the
moral responsibility rest when the
peoDle of the United States wake up
and find out-who did this thing?"

VERMONT ISTATE FAIR. j
Will Observe the Order that Chil
dren under 15 Years Must
Not Attend. A Large At
tendance Urged.
White River Junction, Sept. 4.
The order issued by the State Board
of Health, in effect that children un
der the ages of 15 years must not
attend the fairs of the State will be
observed by the Vermont State Fair
commission in the conduct of the
State Fair to be held here Sept. 12,
13, 14 and 15. This order was issued
with the intention of preventing the
spread of infantile paralysis.
That it will work a hardship on all
fairs, especially the State fair, is
certain, and because of it the State
Fair commission appeals to the ad
ults of the State to turn out in large
numbers to make up for the enforced
absence of the children. With a
premium list aggregating $20,000
and trotting purses close to $5,000
it is necessary that the attendance
be large in order to cover these ob
ligations. No doubt the cancellation
of the Valley Fair at Brattleboro
will assist in stimulating the State
Fair attendance to a considerable
degree, the Brattleboro fair having
been called off by the local board of
health. The fair promises to be the
best in its history. Every effort has
been put forth to provide attractions
that will please all patrons and the
appeal now being made to the pa
triotism of the people to assist all
possible in making the fair at least
self-supnrrting this year will no
doubt find ready response by the
citizens.
Secretary Davis announces that he
has arranged for extra baloon ascen
sions with complicated parachute
drops for Wednesday and Thursday.
In addition to the regular ascensions
each day, this will make a big pro
gram in that popular act. Thursday
the 14th will be Governor's Day,
when Governor Gates with his aids
will be on hand. On this day also
there will be an auction sale of fancy
Holstein cattle, and a sale of sheep
from the Government Farm at Mid
dlebury. These sales are expected
to be largely attended. The exhibits
will be large and varied in every
department. There will be more
horses, cattle and swine than last
year, an the exhibit of sheep will be
of a high order. Floral Hall will
have the largest exhibit ever at the
Fair, ani the Machinery exhibit will
be crowded. State Fish Commis
sioner Titcomb is making arrange
ments foi a big fish exhibit and has
many fine specimens, one of them
being a six and one-half foot stur
geon. The American Shropshire Regis
try Association will offer one share
of stock in their association as an
award to the boy who wins as many
as five honors in the boys' sheep
judging contest.
