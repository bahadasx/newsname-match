BALCONY OF THE HALL
IS
Faulty Construction Makes
it Impossible to See All
of the Stage.
TO LOWER THE BOXES
Theatre Will Be in First
Class Shape When Uni
versity Opens.
The balcony of the new Hall The
ater will be remodeled this week. Be
cause of a mistake In the plans by
someone, the balcony was built at the
wrong slope, and as a result, it was
impossible to view the whole part of
the stage from some of the seats.
After the first few night3, the man
agement sold only a few seats in the
upper floor, and have decided to rem
edy the fault before the University
opens.
"We are trying to get -everything in
shape before the students arrive,"
said Manager Homer Woods this aft
crnon. "When the theater was fin
ished, we found out that 'some one
had blundered and we are working
a large force of men in an endeavor
to finish the remodeling, in record
time. The boxes were too high for
the upper part of the balcony, and we
could continue by selling the ma
jority of the seats, but it is our de
sire to have one of the most complete
houses in the state, and it was neces
sary to have the entire balcony to
give us the greatest capacity."
The row of boxes will be lowered
three feet, and the first four rows of
balcony seats will likewise be low
ered. This will enable the rows of
seats higher up to be elevated, and a
greater slant given the floor. At first
it was thought necessary to tear out
a part of the wall, but this will be
avoided, and in the lower floor of the
theater it will not be noticed that
there is anything going on upstairs
No seats will be sold in the balcony
during the "period of reconstruction,"
but the performances will continue.
The balcony will be closed for one
week.

Marketing and Co-operation and Ad
vanced Agricultural Economics. He
will also conduct a seminar and re

Columbia for in so doing I am not
only leaving my native state but I
am severing my relations with a school
where I have found everything in ab
solute harmony. I have grown to love
Coumbia and her people In the year
that I have been here and I trust
that I find my surroundings at Ames
