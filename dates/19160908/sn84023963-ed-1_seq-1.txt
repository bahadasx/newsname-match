Prohibition Has Little Effect
in Southern State.
Mississippi adopted "prohibition in
1908. 5ikc other so-called "dry"
states, fiowever, she has made no
serious e.Tort to enforce this statute
so unpopular with a large per cent,
of her people. The success of pro
hibition in Mississippi can best be
judged by the official facts as to
drinking in Jackson, the ste capital,
as reported recently by the News of
that city. The newspaper article fol- j

Briefly, the law requires that every
person receiving a shipment of any
kind of "booze" shall E!gn a certifi
cate that the shipment was for his
own use, and stating the quantity in
each package. The express companies
or railroads are not allowed to make
deliveries until these certificates are
signed and the carriers file them in
the circuit court clerk's, office.
Some rather startling facts are
brought out in the figures, for this is
supposed to be a prohibition state.
That booze, however, still is con
sumed in enormous quantities is
shown frdni facts and figures gath
ered from official records.
An example of how much liquor
cornea into a county is the record in
Hinds. Deputy Circuit Court Clerk
Cadwaller has been working hard for
week compiling the figures, , from
dozens of drawers in which the certif
icates are stored. He has prone con
siderably into details tnd hfs list will
show what Jackson proper received,
and also the total number of ship
ments that came into Hinds county.
The figures of Mr. Cadwaller are
extremely interesting. Jhey are as
follows:
For Jackson proper during 1915
there were 25,789 separate liquor
shipments. These included 20.84G
V. gallons of whiskey, 1.463 M: ship
ments of beer in dozen bottle lots, 69
packages of beer listed, 1,169 cases
and casks of beer, 137 kegs of
beer, 926 boxes of beer.
A little figuring will show that this
is an average of 1,73 1-6 gallons of
whiskey a month, or a? gallons a day.
Figuring further, at the rate of 20
average sized drinks to the quart, it
gives more than 3,000,000 , average
sized drinks of whiskey for the year
in the capital of the state alone.
Estimated in money, allowing an
average of $4 a gallon for whiskey
Jackson's whiskey bill in 1915 was
$83,388, and her people spent about
$15,000 for beer, a total of nearly
100,000.
The records show that outside the
city of Jackson, in the county of
Hinds, and including Terry, Byram,
Clinton, Tougalo and Pocahontas,
there were 2,690 packages of intoxi
cating liquors received, of which there
were 2,478 gallons of whiskey.
The figures given above are com
piled solely from official records of
certificates in the offices of the circuit
court clerk, and mean; that these
shipments came by express or freight.
They do not include shipments that
come via another route, namely the
"gripsack" method.
"Why," said one official -"thevo are
hundreds of instances a month where
both whites and negreos got on tho
trains and go to pointe without the
state, and come back with their grips
loaded with bottles of whiskev. Many
people make a business of taking
their dress suit cases and hand bags
to points in Louisiana, load them
down with whiskev and bring them
to Jackson. There is no way, of
course, of getting accurate figures on
such 'shipments but tbe quantity of
liquor brouerht m by this inearth is

WHEN'S HARD CIDER
NGT HARD CIDER?
WHEN IT'S VINEGAR!
The New York Times says:
The case of State vs. Matthews
before the Supreme Judicial Court
of Maine was a prosecution for sell
ing an intoxicating beverage con
sisting of old, or "hard" cider. The
defendant contended that what he
sold was vinegar, and nt a bever
age at all Tlie evidence showed
that when the defendant was asked
if he had any old cider he replied,
"No, but I have some vinegar." Tho
trial judge then asked the witness,
"Was it old cider, which the re
spondent may have called vinegar
with a twinkle in his eye?" The
defendant complained on appoal of
this interrogatory by the court
and concerning it the highest court
said:
"But we think that expression
was nothing more than a sugges
tion to the jury, for their consider
ation, of the possibility that, even
if respondent in answer to Mar
shall's inquiry for old cider, called
what he sold him vinegar, never
theless he did not mean it and so
.indicated to Marshall."
The court then goes on to argue
that it was plain from the evidence
that this was what was meant, be
cause otherwise Marshall, who was
after old cider, would not have
bought three gallons of what he
was told was vinegar and use it as
a beverage. Tho court then say.:
"It is the authoritative expres
sion of an opinion as to an issue of
fact arising in the case which the
statute prohibits and not the sug
gestion of air obvious inference
from admitted faots and circum
stance, made to assist the jury in
coming to a clear understanding
of the law and the evidence.

RUNNING THE RHEA.
Hlat!ve of Ostrich Chased With Oop
and Horse.
Tor the person who desires a
unique form of sport running the
afeii?' in. southern TAtagonia is-rec
ommended. The Thea is a meraher
of tlie ostrich familv, hut somewhat
mailer. It runs with the swiftness
of a greyhound or a fast horse and
has a knack of douhling on ita
track, which often serves it in elud
ing its pursuers. The natives in
hunting it use horses, dogs and the
bola. The dogs course after the
fleeing bird in full cry, while tha
hunters follow after at top speed,
; prepared to throw the bola if op
; portunity ofTers.

attached to a thong nx or eight
feet long, serves to hamper the
movements of the bird, for the
balls twine about the part which
the bola strikes regardless of
vhether . it be tho les, neck or
wings. This permits the dogs and
jiiunters to overhaul auü aispaccn
?the bird.
Atv the approach of danger the
will often crouch flat upon tha
End with neck outstretched un-
the grass, remaining "motionless
until the doge have passed. This
strategem is often successful when
the wind is blowing against the
ecent, but when the contrary is the
case the dogs soon discover the hid
ing bird. In this case, doubtless
bevrildered by the sudden failure of
its artless ruse, it makes no attempt
fct escape.
The chase of the rhea, which
ßomotimes extends over a distance
of five or six piiles, is a thrilling
one. It has for the rider all the ex-
, dement of a horse race, with the"

STRETCH YOURSELF.
Do It the First Thing After You Wake
In the Morning.
A splendid thing för the body is
stretching. Whon you first wake
up in themorning, take a gooong
stretch: v Stretch the" hanWas far
out sideways as possible. Then j
stretch them over the head as far as
you can reach, and at the same time
stretch the feet downward as far as
you can. .Raise the feet and stretch
upward just as high as you can, and j
then lower the leet and legs very
slowly.
When you get out of bed, raise
your arms over your head, and.,
standing on tiptoe, see how near you
can reach tho ceiling. Then walk
about the room while in this posi
tion. Stand on the right foot and!
stretch the right arm forward and
upward as high as you can, while at
the same time the left foot is raised
from the floor and stretched out
ward, and Jhe left hand is stretched
backward rrnd dnward. This is a
üno excn'i.-tyfor uic whole body and
is especially good for tht; vfst and
hips, maktng them firm and st-rnrf:
Standing on tho h il foot this exer
cise ran he ro versed.
If you have been sitting in th?
same position for a long time read
ing. studying, writing or sewing and
the mfKclos have I come tired and
cramped, the best thing to do-.is tc
get up and stretch. Sketch' tb
arms upward and outward and for
ward and backward. Lift the Mioni
dors as high as yon can ar1 die;
j them. Expand the ohc.-t a
