"' FOR COUNTY FAIR
i
Horse Racing Feature Promises
to be Unqualified Success
This Year.
i :
! . WORK ON BUILDINGS IS
NOW BEING RUSHED
i
i Nearly Score of Host Horses From the
I Other Side of Range are on Way
',' to Participate in Races.
IThul Cedar City will be one
of the liveliest small cities of
(, the state next week when, on
next Tuesday, the County Fair
opens here, is now positively as
sured. From every quarter in
dications of an extraordinary at
tendance are received.
t; Postmaster Walter Granger,
k a member of the general com-
w mittee, who returned yesterday
:- from the Panguitch fair, has
? positive assurance that not less
i ' ., than 17 of the horses which par-
' kv ticipated in the races at that
I place will be here to compete for
I the liberal purses which are be-
I ing hung up in connection with
. the races at this place.
j . It is also positively stated that
.-:, there will be four or five good
' base ball teams here to compete
in the games to be played each
"J forenoon during the fair.
I ( Some of the Horses Coming.
1 Notwithstanding the fact that the
' ; Sevier County Fair opens on the same
i day that the fair in this county does,
I the Committee has definite assurance
"j that the majority of the horses which
2 participated in the Panguitch Fair
1 . will come to Cedar City in preference
&&' ' ' - KnB 1, Richfield. .. -...,.
rf r..- These horses, nearly a score in
$1 m& number, will include the following, at
v,j least part of which arc well known to
uj ', local horse men:
i Mr. Haws of Escalanto ia coming
1 . with five of his best animals, including
' the notorious Joo and Brady, which
' were strong favorites at the Pang-
, uitch meet last year and won many of
? the purses.
.j ' Mr. Chamberlain of Circleville will
bo here with a trio, headed by his
4 beautiful cole-black favorite, "Shine."
3? Carroll Dalton, also of Circleville,
31 is coming with threo splendid animals,
J including Ralph, the favorite at the
h Panguitch races this year, and Paddy,
I the animal which won tho matched
M; race at that place the other day, on
"q ' a wager of $500 a side.
1 ! Besides the above, J. A. Hunter of
M Coyote is bringing his racer, Don
? Findlay of Kanab will have Lucky
J ' Mack and Snip, his fleet animals, here,
Lady Gunn and Lord Seekle, and oth-
,j er fleet animals will be included.
;.. In addition to these there will be
Jf the usual showing of horses from
vij this county.
Track Will be in Good Condition.
Despite the fact that the track will
be used this year for the first time,
and it has kept tho committee "hump-
l ing" to get it ready, it will be in good
shape, and not inferior to tho other
t race tracks in this part of tho state.
Our reporter was on the grounds yes-
' f terday afternoon and was agreeably
, surprised to find tho track in so good
form. In this connection a good deal
of credit is due the members of the
general committeo, and particularly
Thomas Dix, who has worked unceas-
,& ingly and energetically, to get the
b grounds in shape on so short a notice.
& Grand Stand Will be Ready.
"s Work on the grand stand and ex-
1 hibition building was not commenced
until a few days ugo, but it is being
M pushed rapidly. The foundation and
48 cement supports are in and work on
?jj the frame has commenced. There will
W ' bo a large force on tomorrow, and
n 1 H Sunday it is stated that every cur
ls iP0C pontor employed in town, probably
Jj " aggregating fifty, lmve promised to bo
f on the job, and it is expected that
I Sunday night will see the structure
ready to receive the exhibits. It is
being built on plans and specifications
furnished by Architect Randall Jones,
with a view to permanency as well as
convenience.
v Exhibition Contiguous to Sports.
By arranging to have tho exhibition
building a part of the grand stand,
the pxhibltin is placed "contiguous to
1 i
the sports, where it will be convenient
for visitors to inspect nt any time,
without missing any of the features
of the nmuscment program. Hereto
fore the exhibition has bcerl in a sepa
rate and distinct building, usually a
considerable distance from the race
track or other sports. By this new
arrangement it is believed that n great
many more people will improve the
opportunity pi inspecting the exhibi
tion which, after all, is the real object
of a county fair.
Sports Will be of High Order.
The piescnt indications arc that
the amusements for the County Fair
will be of a most interesting and ex
citing character this year. And by
the way, do not forget that the fair
will open next Tuesday. The commit
tee has the assurance that there will
be a representative lot of race horses
here from all the southern counties;
a number of good ball teams will com
pete for the liberal prizes that are
being offered, and it should be noted
that a number of good teams are be
ing developed, in anticipation of the
games at the various fairs. Enter
prise defeated Lund the other day by
very decisive odds, and it is expected
that the Enterprise team will be one
of the competitors for the prize mon
ey. St. George has also promised a
return game at our fair in exchange
for the visit of our local team at their
fruit festival, which is on this week.
The new track is being worked down
nicely and is expected to be in good
shape for the races and games. Work
on the grand stand is also being hur
ried forward, and will doubtless be
in readiness by the time tho fair op
ens. The expense of getting an aero
plane was still a littlo too great for
the committeo this year, because of
the big expense incident to getting a
new fair ground and buildings in
shape, but the amusements will be of
a high order and plenty of entertain
ment is assured all those attending.
A general invitation is extended to
all those so inclined, to join us at the
fair in Cedar City this year.
What Committee Asks of You.
The Committee has been at a heavy
expense in improving'the grounds fand
erecting a new grand stand and ex
hibition building this year, and as a
special favor they ask that people
witnessing the races, ball games and
other amusements have respect for
this expenditure, and so far as possi
ble occupy seats in the grand stand, or
drive their cars into the rgounds to
the spaco reserved for them, and not
deprive the association of the revenue
to which they are rightfully entitled
by viewing the events from the stnte
highway, which runs contiguous, as
it has been impossible to fence against
this contingency tho present season,
though it will doubtless be done be
fore another fair or tournament is
held here.
They want you all to see the many
umusements arranged for the fair,
but they want you to sco them from
inside the grounds and not from the
public highway.
Everything indicates that there will
be a record-breaking crowd at the fair
and if you're not there it will be your
own fault.

The Get Together club was organ

Air. Marion Wouluy of Kaimb, ono
of the U. A. C. graduates lust spring, M
was seen about town tho fore pnrt of M
this week. His business was connect- M
ed with the procuring1 of iheep and M
grounds on which to feed them tho M
coming winter. Wo are always glad M
to see Mr. Woolley among us. M
It was nlnnned to utilize tin Lnbor M
Day holiday in Cedar Citv in elonring H
Mn streets and varnnt lots of weeds: fl
but somehow wo did not nnnonr to H

1v. howpvpr. nnd we tnmt that our cit- 'B

future nnd make tho streets look ns if H
"somebody was about home." M
The bushings houtp hnvp nt Inst H

huso boll team in rood shanc. This M
week they hnve subscribed enough M
money to nav for new suits all the H
wnv around nnd imtRtu1 with money H
for ("cnenpps on tlmlr Dixie trip. If H
the boys crct a little of this sort of M

Cedar Citv shouldn't have a tenm that H

a honolpss democrat, nnd insists that M
our next governor will be n Hebrew. H
Of course, wo put this down ns one of H
those empty democratic promises thnt

it wpre not for his nolltlcs Mr. Doolev M

Four good, creditabla business blocks '

at least most of them arc, beginning. h-jB

and electric light poles from the center H
to tho side of the street will nlso be M
a very decided improvement, and th'c H
curbing and guttering of the street in H
the business section will also be a fl
welcome improvement. Those of us M
who are here scarcely notice those fl
chnnges, as thoy conio about grndunlly -H

In addition to tho business blocks H

eight right nice modern homes being H
