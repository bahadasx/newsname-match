possible tho produce being sent in
liv Mm farmers is prepared and

built aids in tho handling of tho
ennned products, for aB fast as the

Mrs. Doleshal gave her third an
nual picnic to a number of her
friends, boih adult and juvenile, on
Milton crook on Wednesday of Inst
woek. The dato happened to be
Helen Hoffman's fifth birthday anni
versary which was also celebrated.
A delightful time was spent on tho
cool banks nnd In the shady groves.
It required two cars to convey tho

Mrs. Port Hoffman, Mr. and Mrs.
Rees Hall, Miss McCallister nnd

Deputy Game Warden Brown was
in tho city again Wednesday. From
him we learn that deer are quite
plentiful this season, which he at
tributes to the general observance of
the law. While there are a few vio
lators, even these parties are begin
ntng to realize that game must be
preserved or deer will soon dlsap
pear. Ho especially requests the
members of the rod and gun clubs
ot this county to each one consider
himself a deputy warden in order
that game laws will be fully oh
served.
L. J. Van Orsbovon, county sur
veyor, with a crow of men, has just
finished locating a new road com
mencing at Columbia City. Tho line
follows tho old logging bed of the
Peninsula Logging Company to
point 6 Mi miles west of Columbia
City. This. will make a splendid
road and can bo repaired at little ex
ponse, as It is already graded and
the bridges are In good shape, es
pecially the strlngors. This road
leads up to tho logged off land In that
section, which Is being sold in small
tracts to settlers. The road work
will not likely be done this season.
In the Astoria regatta which
closed Monday, two St. Helens boys
got away with the trophies, In the
log rolling contests Owen Carley
won the championship of the Colum
bia river, and O. C. Elliott won the
second place. The contest was one
much enjoyed by tho thousands who
witnessed it, and the fact that St.
Helens took both first and second
places is gratifying to our local people.
HEAVY BLASTING
COMPLAINED
OF
The Columbia Contract Company
during the past week has been set
ting off some very heavy blasts and
the town has been much "shaken
upr" An appeal to their superin
tendent has brought forth no res
ponse and the council has taken the
matter up. In all probability some
ordinance will be passed so that the
lives and property of our citizens
may be protected from the Indiffer
ence and recklessness of the super
intendent of the above mentioned
company, who seems to think that
getting results is far more important
than any claim the citizens of the
community might have..
OBSERVANCE OF
LABOR DAY
This day, set apart for tho observ
ance of respect to labor was appro
priately observed In St. Helens. Many
of the large manufacturing concerns
closed down and a majority of the
stores closed one-half of the day.
Whllo the schools opened, little work
was done and the scholars were dis-
I missed for the day at noon.
