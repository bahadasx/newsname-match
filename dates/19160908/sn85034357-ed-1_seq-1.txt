ESTABLISHED 1845.
WILSON ACCEPTS
THE NOMINATION
In Ringing Speech President
Sets Forth Accomplishment
of Democrats in Four Years
of Power.
The following is an extract from
President Wilson's speech of accept?
ance delivered at Shadow Lawn, N.
J., Saturday:
Senator James, gentlemen of the
notification committee, fellow citi?
zens: I cannot accept the leadership
and responsibility which the national
Democratic convention has again, in
such generous fashion, asked me to
accept, without first expressing my
profound gratitude to the pnrty for
the trust it reposes in me after four
years of fiery trial in the midst of af?
fairs of unprecedented difficulty, and
the keen sense of added responsibility
with which this honor fills (I had al?
most said burdens) me as I think
of the great issues of national life and
policy involved in the present and im?
mediate future conduct of our govern?
ment. I shall seek, as I have always
sought, to justify the extraordinary
confidence thus reposed in mo by
striving to purge my heart and pur?
pose of every personal and of every
misleading party motive and devoting
every energy I have to the service of
the nation as a whole, praying thai
I may continue to have the counsel
nnd support of all forward-looking
men at every turn of the difficult
business.
For I do not doubt that the people
of the United States will wish the
Democratic party to continue in con?
trol of the government. They are not
in the habit of rejecting those who
have actually served them for those
who are making doubtful and con?
jectural promises of service. Least of
all are they likelv to substitute those
who promised to render them parti?
cular services and nroved false to
that promise for those who have ac?
tually rendered those very services.
Boasting is always an empty busi?
ness, which pleases nobody but the
boaster, and I have no disposition to
boast of what the Democratic party
has accomplished. It has merely done
its duty. It has merely fulfilled its
explicit promises. But there can be
no violation of good taste in calling
attention to tho manner in which
those promises have ben carried out
or in adverting to the interesting fact
that many of the things accomplished
were what the opposition party had
again and again promised to do, but
had left undone. Indeed, this is mani?
festly part of the business of this
year of reckoning and assessment.
There is no moans of judging the fu?
ture except by assessing the past.
Constructive action must be weighed
against destructive comment and re?
action. The Democrats either have or
have not understood the varied inter?
ests of the country. The test is con?
tained in the record.
What is the record ? What were
the Democrats called into power to
do? What things had long waited
to be done, anil how did the Demo?
crats do them ? I tis a record of ex?
traordinary length, and variety, rich
in elements of many kinds, but con?
sistent in principle throughout and
susceptible of brief recital.
Republican Failures.
The Republican party was put out
of power because of failure, practical
failure and moral failure; because it
had served special interests and not
the country at large; because, under
the leadership of its preferred and
established guides, of those who still
make its choices, it had lost touch
with the thoughts and the needs of
the nation nnd was living in a past
age and under a fixed illusion, the
illusion of greatness. It had framed
tariff laws based upon a fear of for?
eign trade, a fundamental doubt as
to American skill, enterprise and ca?
pacity, and a very tender regard for
the profitable privileges of those who
had gained control of domestic mar?
kets and domestic credits; and yet
had enacted anti-trust laws which
hampered the very things they meant
to foster, which were stiff and in?
elastic, and in part unintelligible. It
had permitted the country through?
out the long period of its control to
stagger from one financial crisis to
another under the operation of a na?
tional banking law of its own fram?
ing which made stringency and panic
certain and the control of the larger
business operations of the country by
the bankers of a few reserve centers
inevitable; had made as if it mennt
to reform the law, but had faint?
heartedly failed in the attempt, be?
cause it could not bring itself to do
the one thing necessary to make the
reform genuine and effectual, nnmely
break up the control of small groups
of bankers. It luid been oblivious
or indifferent to the fact that the
farmers, upon whom the country de?
pends for its food and in the last
analysis for its prosperity, were with?
out standing in the matter of com?
mercial credit, without the protection
of standards in their market trans?
actions, and without systematic
knowledge of the markets themselves;
that the laborers of the country, the
great army of men who man the in?
dustries it was professing to father
nnd promote, carried their labor as
a mere commodity to market, were
subject to restraint by novel and dras?
tic process in the courts, were with?
out assurance of compensation for in?
dustrial accidents, without Federal as?
sistance in occomodating labor dis?
putes, nnd without national aid or ad?
vice in finding tho places nnd the in?
dustries in which their lnbor was
most needed. The country had no
nationnl system of road construction
nnd development. Little intelligent
attention was paid to the army, and
not enough to the navy. The other
republics of America distrusted us,
5 because they found that wc thought
first of the profits of American in?
vestors and only as an nfterthought
j of impartial justice and helpful
friendship. Its policy was provin?
cial in all things; its purposes were
out of harmony with the temper nnd
purpose of the people and the timely
development of the nation's interests.
So things stood when the Demo?
cratic party came into power. How
do they stand now? Aliko in the
domestic field and in the wide field of
commerce of the world, American
business and life and industry have
been set free to move us they never
moved before.
The tariff has ben revised, not on
the principle of repelling foreign
trade, but upon the principle of en?
couraging it, upon something like n
footing of equality witho ur own in
respect of the terms of competition,
and a tariff board has been created
whose function it will be to keep the
relations of American with foreign
business and industry under constant
observation, for the guidance alike of
our business men and of our congress.
American energies are now directed
towards the markets of the world.
The laws against trusts have been
clarified by definition, with a view to
making it plain that they were not
directed against big business, but only
i against unfair business und pretense
of competition where there was none;
and a trade commission has been
created with powers of guidance and
accommodation which have relieved
business men of unfounded fears and
sot them upon the road of hopeful
and confident enterprise.

MUCH BOOZE DESTROYED
Confiscated "John Barleycorn"
Running Down Gutters in
Pocahontas.
Reports reaching here from Poca?
hontas were to the effect that there
was "weeping and gnashing of teeth"
among certain of its citizens yester
day over the execution of the order
of the court that the large amount
nt liquor and beer recently confiscat?
ed in that town be destroyed. Com?
monwealth's Attorney, James W.
Harman and Judge Fulton Kegley,
of the TazewclP Circuit Court, re?
ceived the lion's share of the con?
demnation over the part they took in
the enforcement of the dry laws in
Pocahontus, mention of which trials
has been made in this paper.
Deputy Sheriff George Rosenbaum
ind policeman Denen were charged
by the court to destroy the booze and
proceeded to the place of "execution''
yesterday morning followed by a
large crowd, estimated nt 500 people
When they reached the cccr.c of ac?
tion, many of the old topers are said
to have provided themselves with re?
ceptacles from teaspoons to milk
buckets and vainly endeavored to
i.'atch a portion of the "life-saver" as
it trickled down the gutters of Pocn
hontns on its way to the Blucstono
River. On account of the terrific heat,
\nd the consequent evaporation of the
liquid, little of it could be saved, and
n their desperation the "boys" fell
upon their knees and gave up in des?
pair.
Many of the citizens of our neigh?
bor town, who nrc sometimes wont to
"forget things for a season," are I
said to threaten charges ngainst the
responsible authorities for this rqek
'ess waste of such valuable merchan?
dise. On the other hand, Brother
Rickman, and the many other good
citizens of Pocahontas, who have been
foremost in supporting the officers in
the enforcement of the law, are said
Lo have stood out of 'whiffing" dis?
tance of this trngedy with that com
pacent, self satisfied look that covers
Lhe countenance of one who has
fought long and won a glorious ami
honorable victory.
MONTE ROLFE BATTLES WITH
STORM?LOST IN THE CLOUDS.
(Extract from exchange, Wnpako
neta, O., Aug. 24.)
The famous English aviator, Monte
Rolfe, had a thrilling experience on a
cross country flight from Wapakoneta
to Kcnton, and return. Yesterday
morning Rolfe started for Kenton.
and had succeeded in getting about
half way when a storm came up. De?
termined to make the best of it, he
drove his machine with all peed to
ward the sky, in order to get above
the clouds and rain. This he succeed?
ed in doing, but after getting above
the clouds, he became lost and flew
around in u circle, so as to be able
to get his bearings. In doing so he
saw an open spot In the clouds nnd
made for it. When ho reached the
spot he found himself hemmed in all
around, and his machine going at
the rate of 70 miles an hour he be?
came confused, and turned his mac?
hine upwards again, nnd drove thr?
ough the blinding rain and wind until
he was safe above the clouds again.
This time he found thnt he had lost
nil track of direction. He then started
for some place, not knowing where
he would land, nnd finally flew north
and over Ada. As there seemed to be
no rain there he came down close
?nough to read "Ada" on the Ada
Manufacturing Company's building,
when he knew where he was and
nade a detour to the north, then cast
und south, nnd finally reached Ken
ton. But he did not land, and flew
straight west toward Wapakoneta
again. By this time the clouds had
disappeared to some extent, nnd the
rain had ceased so that he could soc
the town. He landed safely after fly?
ing about 80 miles, where he should
have flown about 64 miles, the dis?
tance from Wapakoneta to Kcnton
and return.
Rolfe said last night that he has
Imd many narrow escapes, but Urn
one was a corker. After the storm ho |
flew again this nfternoon, but waa
content to do his wiggles nnd other
:razy stuff nearer the home plate.
Rolfe has been engaged for nn ex?
hibition of his stunts nt the Tnzewell
Fair, and the attraction will be a
fenture of the occasion. His ability
as an aviator, and his unusual daring
has placed him among the foremost
in the ranks of the airmen. adv.

TRINKLE OPENS CAMPAIGN
Is Well Received in Address to
Large Audience of Votrs in
Pulaski County.
Hon. E. Lee Trinkle opened his
campaign for Congress in Pulaski
Monday before an audience that pack?
ed every available seat in the Opera
House, while hundreds more stood
outside the front entrance and tho
side doors. There would have been
several thousand to hear him had
there been an auditorium large
enough to accommodate thorn.
He was introduced in a pleasing
manner by Hon. James T. Trolinger,
a near kinsman, nnd formerly a mem?
ber of the Virginia House of Dele?
gates.
As Mr. Trinkle came forward he
was received with loud and long con?
tinued applause, which was repeated
at frequent intervals as he proceeded
eloquently with cogent arguments and
luminous exposition to point out the
various admirable features in the
large amount of constructive legisla?
tion that has been passed by a Dem?
ocratic Congress under the wonder?
ful leadership of Woodrow Wilson.
He was also cheered to the echo
when he paid his respects to Slcmp
and Hughes and excoriated them with
biting sarcasm and withering ridicule.
When he concluded hundreds canto
forward to grasp his hand and pledge
him their support.
It was indeed a "field day" for
Trinkle, nnd has started such n wave
of enthusiasm in his favor as bids
fair to overwhelm Slemp.

and Other Departments?
The Corn Show.
The Fair comes curly this year, nnd
is now only two works oil". All ex?
hibitors should know by this time
what they will have to show in tho
Agricultural Department. It has been
suggested that it will he too early to
show corn?this is not true. While
corn will not be mature, this has been
taken into account in propnring the
premium list, and all will he on tho
utmu footing. The Pair Association
distributed seed corn last spring witii
the understanding that every one re
reiving a start id' pure bred corn
would bring the best 10 onra to the
Fair, and 1 will nxpect I i Ivmr Iron
all of these as well as those who wore
supplied last year, even though the
.inn is little past the roasting-our
.tage- but 1 feel sure that much ?>:'
it will be fai- belter than this. Let
every termer who has pure-bred corn,
either white or yellow, show what he
I'.as done with this com this year.
Also ilo not overlook tin fuel that
there is a nice premium on the com?
mon corn that we have been raising
here for years, and 1 want to see a
large exhibit in this class both of the
white und yellow varieties. Illing
your corn and let us have a mammoth
corn show.
Of course, grains and grasses in
the sheaf have already been prepared
for exhibition and from whnt. I ran
now see we are going to have the
best show in this line we have over
had.
Your garden will be just, right to
furnish a good showing. Potatoes
have never been finer than this year.
Let every one have his best ami larg?
est ready and make the vegetable ex?
hibit the best we have ever had.
Some of our small fruits have been
a failure this year, but with grapes
and apples we should have the larg?
est fruit exhibit, we have ever hud.
The outlook is good. Take care in
selecting your npplcs nnd let us make
this a show of which we will be
proud. Mr. Wall, the county demon
slrntor, will help any one in selecting
fruit or give instructions for pack?
ing boxe.-; of apples. Don't hesitate Id
call on him.
So far as can now sec we arc go?
ing to have the most instructive agri?
cultural exhibit in the history of tho
Fair, Do not fail to see it.

NEW TERRITORY
INVADEDSUNDAY
"Flying Squadron" Besieges
Baptist Valley?Speeches at
Lock hart's Chapel and at
Bandy Schools.
Tin? Plying Squadron invaded now
Sunday School territory last Sunday,
and one of tin* party narrates a little
"gossip" heroin, winch may ho of in?
terest to some folks who are interest?
ed in the groat .Sunday School work
in tho county. There were two Ex's
in tho party-? Ex-President C. R.
Brown, ami Ex-Socrelary J. A. Les?
lie, and Mr. P, 11. K?thes, the new
Secretary of the County Sunday
School Association.
Wo traveled pleasantly in llold
relh's Hupp, most of the road being;
Smooth ami lino, except a gap or two
in Baptist Valley.
AT LOCKll ART'S CHAPEL, AT
BANDY.
Cur destination was Bandy, on llio
Cedar Bluif cut-off, where is located
Luekhnrt's Chanel, one of the oldost
plaoea of worship in the county. How?
ever tho original church build'- ig was
replaced by a now one when the rail?
road was built up Indian Creek, and
tin- site changed. Tin- present build?
ing, a new one, is just across the
creek, and lit t far from whoro tho
I' riner structure stood. The buildit g
is roomy and nice, seated with opera
chairs, has ti nice pulpit am! plat?
form, and is a credit to the commu?
nity.
JNO. A. VERNON, SUPT.
The Squadron reached tho church
about 10:110, ami soon thereafter woro
at work, trying its level host, to point
nut to the guod people present, as
host they might, reasons why the;
Sunday Schools should ho fostered,
mid why the host there is in us all is
lidded in the groat work. Tho people,
wore chui'iUlblo and kind enough to
Hilten, mid to nay that the speeho.i
woro good.
Mr. .lohn A. Vornon is Superinten?
dent. He is doing his host with tho
In-lp i>r n number of good women, and
a surprisingly small number of men.
Tin- men around Lockhnrt's ('Impel
seem to think that I ho Sunday School
work is not ii man's job. Mr. l.nwyor
llnrriminn, brother to the late George
HarriHMOII, who died in this town
some years ago, is teacher for the
Hildo class, and renders good service.
,1. M. Alloy, .1. A. Payne and a num?
ber of representatives of other schoola
wore present.
Wo had our dinner with Mr. Vornon
at his home, about a mile from tho
church (I thought it was about 5)?
and a first class one it was, just such
an one as you expect in the homeof
n prosperous, Tnzewoll county farm?
er. Vornon lives high - 1 mean geo?
graphically. His home is on an ele?
vated plateau, and, like heaven, u
little hard to roach hut all righl a Clor
you got (here. Ho adjoins, utmost, tho
farm of tho lato W. P. Payne, and
looks north, south, east and west upon
miles .-ind mih s of billowy lull;, and
lowering mountains, a glance around
show that he is a pains-taking, sys?
tematic farmer. Ho has line Berk?
shire hogs, and pair of long-legged,
long-cared, strong mules?the only
illliniuls which 1 saw, nnd these last
named I looked over at a safe dis?
tance in front.
I'.- chief wealth, (earthly, I monn),
consists in his family of bright b.-ys
and girls. One son is a Methodist
minister. Rev. W. I, Vornon, now at
Chatlnroi, W. Va.j one is with .lohn
I'eery at Cnry; one daughter, married
a Mr. Sargeant, and one o. Mr. Settle,
and settled in Bristol, (no pun), and
three girls and a baby boy are still
at home.
At Mr. Vermin's we mot Mrs. Whitt,
the ngod sister of the lain Boston
Steele-, and mother of Mrs. Oscar
Young, of Cucumber, W. Va. She ban
also two sons. Mrs. Whitt lias passed
the line some distance towards tho
goal, and calmly waits the boatman's
call. She has, she said, been a mem?
ber of the church more than fifty
years and knows in whom she has
believed. This being true the rest is
easy.
Afternoon Meeting and the Dogs.
Wo had a meeting in the afternoon
which was equally pleasant and profi?
table, After a line, short address by
Mr. Brown and a few "scattering re?
marks" by another member of the
squadron, Mr. Korbes had his inning,
made a good speech of a business na?
ture and orgnnizod a district Com?
mittee, embracing the schools of that
entire vicinity.
I must mention the singing. Mr.
Vemon has musical gifts, as have also
a number of young people and Law?
yer llarrisson, and they sang songs
of the gospel with impressive force.
Perhaps 1 ought not to take timo
nnd spneo but I will to sny that the
dogs of Lockhart's chapel are church
goers nnd evidently, enjoy company.
They were present in force in the af?
ternoon, and then ami there occurred
the only failure of the entire trip.
Vornon left his place in the choir to
pay his respects to a tall, lank, hun?
gry looking dog, who seemed to bo
part Shepherd, part cur, part wolf and
the other part just plain dog, that
wits making himself most too num?
erous and familiar in the. sanctuary,
and as Vornon swung a number 0
shoe, the dog skidded and Vernon
missed him. This was the only "mis?
carriage of justice" of the entire trip,
and one of the very best and we be?
lieve successful, meetings we have
tried to hold.
HELDRETH AND HIS HUPP.
From Tazewell to Bandy insido of
nnd hour and a half is going well,
considering that five or six miles of
the road is the worst ever. But Hel
dreth took us over and brought uk
back safe and sound without a hitch,
and wo nil voted both driver and car
first class.
THE FARMS LOOKING FINE.
Baptist Valley had on her Sunday
clothes. The fields were resplendent
with grass and fine corn, fast comint"
to maturity, and every orchard londei'
with fruit, and Fullon Thompson wai:
sitting quietly on his front porch ar
we pnssed, in exactly the same place,
and exactly where I saw him sittmr;
two years ago, as I went by. J. A. L.
