CLEANLINESS OF LIFE
Walter Johnson's Only Vice la
That of Chewing Gum.
One of Explanations of Big Fellow'
Remarkable Climb From Gem State
Bushes to "Hlgher-Ups" De
veloped In Idaho.
"And his worst habit Is to chew
gum."
The Idaho fans were wont to say
this of Walter Johnson, the wizard
pitcher of the American league, after
he had gone from the Gem state
"bush" to the "higher-ups." Briefly,
it Is one of the explanations of the big
fellow's remarkable climb and Is a
strong argument for the "form player"
in baseball.
Of course, hitting the pepsin la not
a bad habit, and, other than winning
games, It was, In Johnson's day of
baseball infancy, his only regular cus
tomperhaps still Is for we hear of
.tho California youth doing things on
the diamond that none save a man ui
perfect condition could accomplish,
and It Is no secret that mingling with
the big boys changed Johnson not a
bit Egotism will never get him.
Walter Johnson Is another achieve
ment of the great West where we de
more than exist we live, writes a
Boise (Idaho) correspondent In the
Detroit Free Press. What If the "phe
nom" was overlooked around Los An

rlety ; It was of the extension sort, and
it did not take long for the California
lad to extend it to its limit
Lest we forget it was Walter
Johnson who broke the world's rec
ord for shutouts by pitching 72 In
nings without a score against him. In
truth, it was in a sagebrush league,
for If ever there was such It Is In
Idaho, where they make the native
bush serve even to the length of grow
ing hair on bald heads. But It miti
gates from the record not one whit
for anyone familiar with baseball
kinks knows It would be Just as much
a record If made In the big leagues.
It Is a rare combination that figures
In the success of Wnlter Johnson, and
It offers a strong argument for clean
liness of mind and body In sports.
Johnson keeps In perfect physical con
dition, and his mind Is one of those
open books that any might read with
profit. Always fair, he never "crabs"
nor "lays down," but gives his best at
all times. Popular? Well, the word
hardly is big enough to fit his case.
GRIFFITH HITS AT SPITBALL
Manager of Washington Team Says
Delivery Is Not Natural and Is
Cause of Errors.
Clark Griffith Is against the spit hall.
He Is hoping for and predicting the
day when It will be legislated out of
baseball. Says he : "If I had my choice
of the two evils, I'd pick the emery
ball. The spltball isn't any more of a
natural delivery than the emery ball
and It's more offensive. The spit on
tho ball causes a lot of errors when
Holders make wild throws grabbing tho
ball at the slippery spot. It spoils
clean fielding and therefore hns a ten

HOW AMERICAN
YOUTH GOT THE

Wounded Driving Ambulance He
Is Given Highest Military
Honor.
ARE DOING A GREAT WORK
American Ambulance Drivers Remark
able Experiences Shown In Extracts
From Letters to Friends and
Relatives in This Country.
New Xork. About 250 young Amer
icans are engaged In driving in the
different services of the American Am
bulance hospital in Paris. Some idea
of the greut work they are performing
la contained In extracts from letters
sent to relatives nnd friends In this
country. The latest of these commu
nications Is from William M. Barber,
twenty-one-year-old son of J. A. Bar
ber, lawyer of Toledo, and one-time
Judge In the Ohio courts.
loung Barber is now recovering
from a serious wound received in the
performance of his duty at Verdun,
where he displayed such exceptional
bravery that he was decorated by the
French authorities with the Medullle
Mllltaire, the highest medal for mili
tary valor In Frunce.
Young Burber started from this port
on May 6 nnd was wounded on June
38. His captain, Loverlng Hill, In re
porting his cose to the Ambulance hos
pital, said the boy was driving his am
bulance with three wounded soldiers
at midnight along one ot the most
dangerous roads at Verdun. Be was
forced t(. stop by shells bursting
abend of him. Diving a lull In the
fliVug he tarte' again, when a shell
burst a few yri3 away. Many small
fragments s,Uek him, one penetrating
a lung ana another his side. Not
withstanding his wounds he went on
until he fell, showing, as his cuptutu
said, the most splendid pluck, doing
dangerous work with enthusiasm and
coolness. Recovering from the ef
fects of his wounds, Mr. Barber wrote
from his cot In the American Ambu
lance hospital the following letter on
June 80 to his parents:
Tore Side and Legs.
"Dear Folks at Home, Abroad and
Grandma :
"Four nights ago I had a pretty nar
row escape. I con mention no names
here, but this Is the gist of the story :
"I was driving my car, with three
wounded soldiers in It along a road
that was being shelled. Well, I got In
the midst of a pretty hot shower, so I
stopped my car and got under It A
few minutes later I supposed it was
blowing over, so I got out. I had no
sooner got out when I heard one of
those big obuses coming, the loudest I
had ever heard. I ran to the front of
my car, crouching down lu front of
the radiator. When It burst it struck
my car.
"I was only hurt a little. 1 was not
disfigured in any way. It tore my side
and legs a little.
"The French treated me wonder
fully. I succeeded In getting the next
American ambulance driven by Wheel
er (a great boy), who took me to the
city of , where our post Is. Here
I was given first aid, and the medical
chief personally conducted me in an
American ambulance, In the middle of
the night to a very good hospital. They
say I have the best doctor In France
In Paris.
"Well, I woke up the next day In a
bed, and have been recuperating ever
since. Everyone is wonderful to me.

"Dear Folks:

they are fast doing, I will be Just as

very happy here and hope every day
that you are as happy and never worry

Driving Under Fire.
Another letter vividly describing the
experiences of ambulance drivers at
the front was sent by. the young
Am rican who volunteered to take
charge of the first ambulance provided
by members of the New York stock ex
change. In that letter to his parents
the writer says:
"Well, I'm still alive and kicking, but
the Lord only knows why. I finally
started work at Verdun on the 21st
of June. I quit the 7th of July. I
hope never to put In, a reign of terror
like that again. The first night we
started we were greeted with a gas
attack and had to wear our masks for
about three hours. Luckily they were
the weeping kind, that Is, It makes you
cry like the devlt If you breathe
enough of It, It mokes you very sick,
but it wasn't the asphyxiating kind.
We went from Verdun to a poste de se

trenches, about 600 yards away from
the Boches. It was- In the cellar of
what remained1 of a house; the rest
of the place was nothing but piles of
bricks, etc. There was another post
half way between and another a little
farther to the left

shell fire all the time, and the second
night they shelled the poste de secours
very heavily. I came up the road, and
