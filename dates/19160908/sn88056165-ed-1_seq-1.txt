LIGHT VOTE
AT PRIMARY
Both County and State Cast
Small Vote Tuesday—Park
er Conceded to Have Won
Nomination for Lieut. Gov.
Election day passed off very
quietly here Tuesday and only
about 160 votes were cast out of
more than five hundred in this
precinct. Most of the farmers
were busy in the harvest fields
and, as the contests on the tick
ets were not serious ones,
only a small vote was cast. In
fact, the vote in both county and
state was light and was restricted
largely to the town population,
while the country voters paid at
tention to their work in hand and
left their voting until the gener
al election in November.
In the state D. W. Davis, the
American Falls banker, won out
in the race for governor on the
republican ticket, while Geo. E.
Crum, of Lewiston, was second.
Burton L. French outran both
McCracken and Elliott in the race
for congress and will be the run
ning mate of Addison T. Smith
in the coming campaign.
For attorney general M. J.
Sweeley was nominated over
three other contestants and Geo.
R. Baker is again the candidate
of his party for secretary of state
as is also John W. Eagleson for
state treasurer.
George W. Lewis had a close
race for state auditor but landed
the position, while B. M. Holt of,
Caldwell, secured the nomination
for lieutenant governor.
Miss Ethel Redfield defeated
Miss Catherine Bryden for state
superintendent of public instruc
tion.
On the non-partisan judicial
ticket John C. Rice lead with
Robert N. Dunn second, Judge
Sulliaan being defeated.
There were only two contestants
on the democratic state ticket, E.
L. Parker of Cottonwood, de
feating James H. Frazier, of
Coeur d'Alene, for lieutenant
governor, William T. Dougherty
and Joseph Hanson running very
close for secretary of state.
Returns from the following
seventeen precincts in the coun
ty, Grangeville numbers 1, 2, 3
and 4, Lake, Mt. Idaho, Green
creek, Big Butte, Stuart, Stites,
Clearwater, Newsome, White
Bird, Cottonwood, Border, Fenn
and Yellow Pine, give the follow
ing results on the two tickets:
Democratic

trict Rhoades has a majority over
Yeager of 69, Campbell over
Taylor for probate judge of 30,

is not apt to be much of a change
in the results and the above who

Conferred With Mr. Booth
E. L. Parker, Geo. M. Robert
son, W. B. Hussman, Felix Mart
zen and the writer motored to
Grangeville Monday afternoon
and met State Engineer Booth,
who stated that he expected to
have engineers in this section
within a very short time to take
up the work of locating the state
highway north from Whitebird
to the Lewis county line. At
that time the new engineer will
consider all tentative locations
and will then decide which is the
most feasible and which will
serve the best interests of the
state and the inhabitants of the
territory through which the road
will pass. Mr. Booth stated that
the present survey between
Whitebird and Grangeville i s
very unsatisfactory and will
probably be re-located. From
present indications it would seem
that the chances for getting the
road located across the west side
of the prairie are very good and
the engineer sent in to do the
surveying will be given every
opportunity to size up the local
situation before making his final
decision.
A total of 117 votes were cast
at the school election held Tues
day afternoon at the public school
building and W. M. Schiller and
H. C. Mathiesen were chosen to
succeed Messrs. Schiller and
Parker, whose terms of office had
expired. Following was the vote
cast: W. M. Schiller, 97; H. C
Matthiesen, 77; Felix Martzen,
14; E. L. Parker, 7; Theo. Schae
cher, 15; F. S. Wimer, 15; W.
W. Flint, 1. There was no issue
at the election and many citizens
did not take the time away from
their business affairs to go to the
polls.
STATE TAXJLEVŸ
WAS REDUCED
Board of Equualization Drop
ped Rates on Electric Power
Companies—Governor Ob
jects, But All In Vain.
Boise, Sept. 1.—Tax levies for
Idaho for 1916 were reduced
$155,000 over 1915 by the state
board of equalization when it
made up the schedules for the
year, most of the saving being
made in the general tax levy,
which was whittled down from
$700,000 for 1915 to $565,000 for
1916. The reductions were an
nounced after the board had cut
down valuations of the main lines
of the principal railroads in the
Panhandle country by 5 per cent
in keeping with general reduc
tions made on reality and timber
values in northern Idaho.
Levies for the general interest
and sinking fund and the public
building tax levy were increased
by $25,000 to take care of bonds
and interest to be met.
In 1915 the board raised $810,
081.31 through the total tax levy
by counties. This year they will
raise but $655,000. The board in
1916 raised $900,000. The saving
in taxes results from a decrease
in funds needed for the running
expenses of the state govern
ment.
In fixing the valuations of the
railroad lines of the state the
board clipped the assessments of
the Great Northern, the Milwau
kee the Northern Pacific and
some Oregon Shortline branches,
but made no reductions on thé
main line of the Short Line. Re
ductions were made only on the
main lines of the big roads in the
north end of the state, all of
which were fixed at 5 per cent.
Last year the valuation of the
Northern Pacific's main line was
fixed at $5,426,600; the main line
of the Great Northern was given
a valuation of $5,167,500; and the
Milwaukee's main line was valued
at $5,863,000.
The valuation of the Twin Falls
branch of the Oregon Short Line
was reduced $4,000 a mile. The
North Side branch was reduced
$5,000 a mile, while the valuation
of the Snake belt line was in
creased $1,000 a mile. The valu
ation of the Yellowstone branch
was fixed at $38,000 a mile from
Idaho Falls to Ashton, and from
Ashton to Yellowstone park at
$5,000 a mile. In the past it had
been customary to place the valu
ation of that branch at $25,000 a
mile for its entire length.
Electric current and trans
mission power companies in the
state of Idaho were given sub
stantial reductions in their valu
ations in a majority of cases.
They range from 10 to 25 per
cent. The Washington Water
Power company of Spokane was
given a 20 per cent cut in valu
ation, the board slicing off $500,
000 at one stroke. On the other
hand the Utah Light & Power
company was given a 10 per cent
increase, a total of $2,975.000.
The other noticeable increase was
given the Thousand Springs
Power company, or 20 per cent.
Out of eight of the larger opera
ting hydro-electric companies in
the state, six were given reduc
tions in valuations and two in
creases. Over a half million
dollars was the cut in the valu
ations of the six power companies
reduced and over a quarter of a
million constituted the increases.
The increases in valuations as
set by the board are as follows:
Utah Light & Power company,
raised 10 per cent; Thousand
Springs Power Co. increased
20 per cent. The reductions set
a
a
by the board follow: Washington
Water Power company, reduced
20 per cent; Lewiston-Clarkston
Improvement company, reduced
10 per cent; Grangeville Electric
Light & Power company, reduced
20 per cent; North Idaho and
Montana Power company, re
duced 10 per cent; Northwest
Light & Power company, reduced
25 per cent; Canyon Creek Light
& Power company, reduced 25
per cent. Practically all of the
several other power companies
are given the same values as last
year.
Governor Alexander moved to
increase the valuation of the
Utah Light & Power company 15
instead of 10 per cent, but the
motion was lost. He fought
against the reductions authorized
for other companies by the board.
The valuations of these several
companies as placed by the board
ago follow: Utah Light & Power
company, $2,975,000; Washington
Water Power company, $2,500,
000; Lewiston-Clarkston Improve
ment company, $177,280; Grange
ville Electric Light & Power com
pany, $156,162; North Idaho &
Montana Power company, $196,
650; Northwest Light & Power
company. $160,000; Thousand
Springs Power company, $90,000;
Canyon Creek Light & Power
company, $50,000.
Polers Enjoyed Fine Vacation
Mr. and Mrs. Geo. Poler and
Mr3. Bart Simon returned late
last week from an auto trip to
coast points and the former is
now back at work again at the
local railroad station. Mr. Poler
said they had the trip of their
lives and he hopes to be able to
repeat it in a couple of years.
Ä'hey left this place about the
first of August with Prof, and
Mrs. L. C, McMahon and autoed
to Portland over the Columbia
River Highway and, after spend
ing a few days in the "Rose City"
went on north to Olympia, Ta
coma and Seattle, thence across
the Cascades to Spokane and
home. They traveled over hun
dreds of miles of hard surface
highway, saw more fine scenery
than the average person believes
exists, stopped often at camping
places along the road and en
joyed life to the fullest extent
every day they were gone. Mr.
Poler says the only thing he will
change in the program should he
make a second trip will be to
take their beds along and camp
out all along the route. He .sa^s
the trip is one of the finest in the
west and well worth the time of
anyone to.make if they can pos-,
sibly get away from their work
long enough t» enjoy the outing.
Tennis Teams Played Games
Several members of the local
tennis club motored to Grange
ville Sunday and met the teams
of the county seat town, in the.,
'first contest of the season. "The
ladies came home victorious after
the^pntest but the men were
not so fortunate and left their
scalp locks dangling at the belts
of the Grangeville players. How
ever, they report a very enjoy
able day in spite of the defeat
and having to auto home through
the mud. Those making the
trip from here were C. W. Jen
kins and wife, F. W. Nuxoll and
wife, Misses Clara and Edith
Humphrey, Mamie Burgand and
Agne Maugg, Messrs. F. A. Kel
sey, Henry Hussman, Harold
Simon, Hugo Funke and Martin
Wirrer.
The Grangeville teams are
scheduled to play a return match
on the local courts Sunday after
noon, providing the weatherman
is agreeable.

They Had A Great Trip
Otto Aichlmayr and M. S.
Hendrickson returned Tuesday
evening from their trip to Wyo
ming, having been gone just twp
weeks on the trip. They went
south by way of the Salmon river
to Weiser and Boise, thence to
Twin Falls and Pocatello and on
into Wyoming. After visiting at
Big Piney they decided to return
home by the northern route and
motored up through the Jackson
Hole country, through Yellow
stone National Park to Living
ston, thence to Missoula and
across the mountain to Wallace,
thence to Spokane and home.
They report atrocious roads
through southern Idaho and say
they were not able to make more
than 75 miles a day when run
ning from twelve to fourteen
hours. This threw them far be
hind their running schedule and
caused them to choose the north
ern route for the return trip even
though the distance was consider
ably greater. The trip through
the park was made at the time
the railroad strike was threaten
ing and everyone was trying to
get out to the railroads and home
before the strike went into effect,
consequently the places in the
park were all closed and they
had no chance to view any of
the wonders there. They report
fine roads through Montana,
north Idaho and Washington and
say this route is a fine one for
autoists and can not be equalled
for scenic beauty, but advises all
to steer clear of south Idaho.
They traveled 1835 miles on the
trip and spent only $35.75 for
gasoline, even though they had

few punctures and blow*outs and
passed many large cars that were
laid up by the road for repairs,
Mr. Hendrickson says he found
the property he went to look at
in very good condition and will
be able to sell it easily for $35 an
acre or better as soon as the

clusively to cattle raising and the
farms are only hay ranches
where feed is put up for the
cattle herds in the winter.
