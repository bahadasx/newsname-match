The Labor Journal
HARTLEY IS A
DANGEROUS MAN
Bellingham Stand-Pat Paper Has
No Use for Our
The following is taken from the
Bellingham Sentinel a REPUBLICAN
newspaper. Col. Hartley is running
on the REPUBLICAN ticket. Some
harmony:
Col. Hartley is making an unique
campaign since he has confined his
gubernatorial aspirations to the task
of enjoining union men from demand
ing justice at the hands of their em
ployers, lie asks these pertinent
questions:
"Do you believe that any man
should be denied opportunity to work
and earn a living unless he joins a
labo runion?"
Col. Hartley, do you believe it is
right for you to enrich yourself at the
expense of the laborer and his family
by asking him to work for starvation
wages? If you are so desirous for the
welfare of ALL men, why do you not
make it possible in your mills for a
man to make an honest living without
being half slave? Would you work for
the same wages and undertake the
rearing of a family? Again the colonel
asks:
"Do you believe in a labor trust that
dogmatically says who shall work and
who shall not work?"
And you are practicing the very
thing you are condemning. You do
not grant organized labor an oppor
tunity to better its condition, but pull
your purse strings tighter and force
men into slavery equal to that of the
black man before the civil war. You
are not consistent by your own argu
ment, and if you would disfranchise
one army of workers and favor an
other bunch, why would you not, if you
had it in your power, disfranchise the
entire state of labor's product and la
bor's right to exist? Again he asks:
"Do you subscribe to the un-Ameri
can doctrine of the boycott?"
Didn't this government rebel against
the boycott of the South when it re
fused to acknowledge an American
form of government? Didn't it arise
and declare that all men were free?
And didn't Abraham Lincoln declare
that labor was the first product of
earth? Without it what would you be
doing today? Where would your capi
tal be, and what of your boasted lib
erty of men who are not allowed to
protect their rights? You have boy
cotted union labor. Haven't you sub
scribed to the "un-American doctrine '?
Are you a sympathizer of nation-wide
boycott? If not, what are you going
to do with the eGrman boycott of
American manufacturers? Again:
"Do you indorse the intimidating
methods of picketing which would
crush legitimate industry and force
idleness upon men eager to work?"
Do you indorse the method of intim
idating men by telling them if so and
so is not elected you will close down
your plants? Do you indorse hiring
■pie* to watch what your men buy and
eat, and have them report to you in
order that you can place valuation on
their modes of living instead of their
efficiency? Do you indorse the ideas
of living in luxury to the detriment of
the men who make your bread and
butter, nad stack up your gold that
you may be better equipped to fight
them into a state of subjection? If
that is your idea it Is beter you study
up on Americanism and leave the ad
ministration of this state in the hands
of a man who is wholly American and
believes in the full extent of the con
stitution ami Declaration of Inde
pendence. Listen to what he further
says:
"If you do not believe in these
things—if you believe in the fair and
square deal and see the menace of this
| labor trust and would put an end to
it—go to the polls on primary day and
vote for Roland H. Hartley for gov
ernor."
Mr. Hartley if you believe in a
"fair and square deal" then you will
have to admit that all men are created
equal and entitled to life, liberty and
the pursuit of hnppiness. And no man
can enjoy either when he is bound and
fettered with the chains of slavery—
labor's slavery. At the crack of the
whip these slaves of misfortune are

GIRL STRIKERS
ARE TERRORIZED
Detroit Police Force Start Rough
Stuff Against 7000 Women
and Girls
Detroit, Mich. A terrorizing cam
paign baa been Inaugurated by the
police department against 7000 women
and girl cigarmakers, who have sus
pended work at a score of factories
to enforce higher wages and stop the
practice of contributing one cigar to
the company for every 100 cigars
made. Under this system, the com
panies, who are acting as a unit, an
nually secure the labor of hundreds
and thousands of cigars without cost.
The girls were unirganized when they
struck, but have since affiliated to
the Cigarmakers' Union. Judge ('odd
has issued an injunction against tin
strikers and all officers of trade
unions who are assisting them.
Chicago.—President Perkins of the
Cigarmakers' International Union
makes this reference in the official
journal to the strike of Detroit female
cigarmakers:
"Stirring events have taken place
In Detroit Ihe city in which commer
cialism and a big population are the
paramount issues among all classes
except the organized workers and the
unfortunate unorganized. The chase
for the almighty dollar seems to have
submerged all humane instincts, care
and thought of the well-being of the
toiling masses. The public press of
Detroit, with the exception of the
labor papers, have scarcely published
a single word in connection with the
strike. No public spirited woman so
far ln>s found courage enough to raise
her voice in protest against the fright
ful conditions, moral and physical,
under which these girls were com
pelled to work, or say a single word
in defense of the effort on the part
of the girls to achieve, through or
ganization, a decent living wage and
hours of labor that will conserve
health, or against the many unspeak
able and frightfully bad working con
ditions."
MUTUAL LAUNDRY
BUYS OUTSIDE CITY
Seattle Union Laundry Reports the
Seattle. —The business of the Mu
tual Laundry la increasing weekly.
Anil every one is optimistic. Union
men have awakened to the fact that
it is "good for the cause" to treat the
wife as a partner and fellow unionist.
When a wife has become aware of the
vital importance of strict adherence
to labor principles she always insists
on the label on everything and iter
power in that respect is great, because
she is the family buyer. Some educa
tion along these lines has been done
recently, because of so many calls
coming into the Mutual aLundry, say
ing:
"My hubby has explained to me why
you are a union laundry Please send
a driver."
l,ast week the Mutual installed a
large four-pocket washing machine.
Phis machine was not bought in Se
attle. Why? Hecause the prosperity
is so immense with the local supply
houses that they could not act opt an
order. The great prosperity in the
our loyal Seattle business men, is not
in the same class with the laundry
machinery houses of Seattle. Seattle
workingmen could make tins machine,
but, no, they don't need our money.
Buy Washington-made goods or pat
ronlte home industry. Why? The
Mutual Laundry manager. Mr t;riffin,
has tried repeatedly to buy at home,
but he is not permitted.
Of course, this condition has noth
ing to do with the Laundry' Owners'
Association. Not at all. They be
lieve in the principles of the open
shop for the girls. Perhaps the Homo
Consumers' League could explain why
the Mutual must employ San Fran
cisco workmen to make wash ma
chines when they could be and are
made in Seattle.
Meantime the Mutual is ready to
purchase more machinery.
A merchant can get along without
advertising and so can a wagon with

LABOR DAY CELEBRATED IN EVERETT
BY LARGEST PARADE IN HISTORY
LAST MONDAY S DEMONSTRATION PROVES TO BE THE
' BEST EVER —OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED
ATTENDED BOXING CONTEST
Labor Day, lHlt;, will go down in
history as the most successful cele
bration ever hold by unionists in
Everett. The parade, the feature Of
the morning, was attended by the
largest crowd ever before seen on I
parade in the city. While no official 1
count was taken, it was estimated that
.'lotto men, women and children were
in line. The parade was marshaled
by K. .1. dinger assisted by B. T.
Mtiller and Frank Barrett. Probably
Ihe most artistic float was that of the
Painters while the Label League, in
autos, received considerable favorable
comment from the bystanders. The
Stage Workers had a very nice float,
advertising the union show houses of
the city.
The float of the Shingle Weavers
created favorable comment all along
the line of march. It was a good rep-j
resentation of the Hartley system of
"industrial freedom." The telescope
through which you were supposed to
hunt for Hartley—hardly—was very
clever.
Those participating in the parade
were as follows:
Black Manufacturing Company.
Beer and Soda Bottlers of Seattle.
Longshoremen.
Tailors.
Machinists with a clever locomotive
float.
Teamsters.
I'lumbers and Fittres.
Lathers and Plasterers.
Iron Molders.
Typographical Union.
Barbers.
Band.
Cigarmakers.
Women's Label League.

A WORD TO THE
NON-UNIONIST
As an individal the workman is as
helpless as a sapling in a tempest.
He may say that he intends to work
for whom he pleases, for as many
hours as he pleases, and he may feel
that he has a moral right to do so,
but he has not.
And then again, he should know,
as he will sooner or later, perhaps
when it is too late, that he must ask
his employer for leave to work for
what he chooses to pay, and for as
many hours as he desires.
Organized labor bai been able,
through united action and collective
bargaining, to shorten the workday,
raise wages, and in many ways Im
prove the conditions of the workers;
it has prevented reduction in the pay;
lit has made the homes better: it has
'secured better clothes, better food,
more comforts and has made the shop.
factory and the mine a better place in
which to work.
Organized labor has been the fight
ing force in state legislatures and in
congress, not only for labor, but for
all men; it has compellea the passage
of laws to protect the health of the
workers; to take children from the
mill and the factory and place them
in school; to limit the hours of labor
for women and fix their wages above
a living wage; to prevent the loss of
lives and limbs and to compel the pay
ment for Injuries to body or health
It has done this and more, more than
we can enumerate here.
Every time organized labor achieves
a victory it not only raises the status
of the union man and his family, but
of the DOH union man ami his family
as well. And on the other hand, when
a non-union man takes another work-

Boxing Contest
Nearly 1500 boxing fans, hailing
from Everett, Seattle and Tacoma, sat
down in the sunshine and enjoyed a
fast succession of boxing bouts pro
moted by Charles Francis Manning
ami Jack Healey. A good sprinkling
iof (he fair sex saw the show.
Frank Gorman and Laurence Hall,
billed at the main event, failed to
demonstrate as much activity as the
crowd expected and after a mediocre
' session Gorman received the decision
and retained his bantamweight
honors on the Pacific coast.
Travie Davis of Everett and Lloyd
Madden of Seattle dished up the
! fastest bout of the aiternoon, the
Everett boy earning the decision after
landing the largest number of clean
punches. The session started out
; with a rush and both pecked each
j other with straight left drives that
created intense excitement among the
fans.
Kid Lavigne and "Ruby" Morgan,
who was announced as being a resi-
dent of New York City, opened the
bill. In the last round Lavigne suc
ceeded in getting a half-nelson hold
on Morgan nadhte bout was declared
! a draw.
I Another fast bout was a draw event
between Joe Harrahan and Joe Far
rell, both of Seattle, who put up a
clever exhibition brimful of action.
Farrell is perhaps the fastest feather
weight in the Northwest and he had
a big job on his hands in exchanging
punches with is rugged opponent, who
bored in all the time. Harrahan packs
a hefty punch which he landed clean
|in the third round. In the fourth
| round Farrell came back and plucked
a slice out of Harrahan's eye. which
evened up the affair.
Chet Neff and Harry Anderson,
lightweights, boxed a four-round ex
hibition that was enjoyed by the fans.
Anderson is a remarkably clever
boxer, while Neff has been coming to
the front with a rush lately.

tion pictures of the events from an
elevated and movable stand near the
ringside.

degradation of labor.
1. Don't condemn the labor move
ment because you know of "objec
tionable feature.-." Every human iv-
stitution has some imperfections.
I. Don't forget that organization in
creases wages and shortens the work
ing day, making work steadier.
3. Don't shirk the moral obligation
to do all you can to uphold the dignity
of your trade
of living
4 Don't forget that the vast ma
jority of your trade is organized.
What is good for the majorit> is good
for the minority.
5 Don't be blind to your own in
terests —unionism helps all working
men and all society.
tlt>. Don't let so-called "independ
ence" prevent you from being un-
selfish and fraternal. We are all
more or less dependent on some one
or something. "No man stands alone."
Get closer together.
7. Don't retard our progress by re
maining a weapon in the hands of the
employer.
8. Don't forget that our interests
identical. Improvement in your
working conditions means improve
fent for all our crafts.
H. Don't say unions "can t accom
plish their purpose." Over 7,000,009
of unionists think different.
10. Don't think that having gotten
along without the union for five or
fifty-five years that "it ig useless to
iyou." Organized labor has helped you
and is helping now—through better
conditions and increased wages.
