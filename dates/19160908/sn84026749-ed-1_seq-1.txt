POIHNTIMAN
AS POSSIBLE SLAYER
OF JERSEY LAWYER
Doubt Thrown on Story of Man
and Companion in Lovers'
Lane Mystery.
NEW YORK, Bept. 8, The police and
District Attorney's office of Bronx
county were still groping In compara
tive darkness today In their efforts to
to run down the murderers, or discover
a motive for the killing of Dwlght P.
Dllworth, well-to-do attorney of Mont
clatr, N. J.. In Van Cortland Park Sun
day night.
This waa admitted at the District At
torney's office today, despite the fact
that a young woman who Is said to
have declared she witnessed the shoot
ing told a story which at first led
police to predict an arrest would soon
be made.
Investigation of thla story. In which
the witness said Dllworth waa shot by
a woman, left the District attorney In
doubt. The Investigation of the girl's
story continued through the night until
early today. With all available Infor
mation apparently exhausted, the Dis
trict Attorney and his assistants felt
that they were Just where they started.
Nothing oosltlve was presented to con
tradlct the story of Miss Mary McNIff,
Dllworth's companion In the automobile
In which he was shot, that the ttor-, ,!.- .... ih,, ni, .ii .
ney was killed by two masked men whol'or " .Hou,e "ndu. ,n,r a1bouJ1t

The grand Jury was In session today,
but It Is said that sufficient evidence
had not yet been gathered together to
go before that body.
Witnesses in Park.
Shortly after midnight last night. Miss
Mary .McNIff, the young woman com
panion of Dllworth on hla fatal ride
Into the park, waa summoned to the
district attorney's office. Mho was again
questioned by Assistant District Attor
ney Qulgley and detectives.
ihen the attention of the authorities
was turned to the newly discovered wit
nesses. These witnesses are a young
man and a young woman, who told
Qulgley they were In the park, near the
scene of the shooting when Dllworth
was killed. An anonymous letter rrom
another woman gave the police their
first clue.
This letter told of the woman having
h.m-.i tha witness, who was Questioned.
say she witnessed the shooting. The
writer of the letter was flrst found and
questioned. Then the young woman she
named waa brought to the Ktngsbrldge
station, and Anally her companion.
The young woman at first denied
knowledge o fthe shooting, but confront
ed by the original Informant of the au
thorities, Bhe Is said to have admitted
witnessing the killing. The revolver
from which tho fatal shots were Hred
was held by a woman, she said.
When the male companion of the
woman witness was brought to the po
lice station, he also denied having been
near the scene of the crime, at nrst.
The entire case was further complicated
when It developed he waa a married
man, and the woman with whom he was
In the park was not his wife. The wife
was then summoned and questioned as
to her knowledge of her husband's
whereabouts last Sunday night.
Altogether four women wore sum
moned by the district attorney and
questioned. Several other residents of
the Bronx were then sought, as the po
lice were Informed they could corrob
orate parts or me siaierneni maue oy
the woman who witnessed the shooting.
8ho Is said to have furnished the police
with a good description of Dllworth's
assailant.
Jealousy the Motive.
Two detectives left Ktngsbrldge sta
tion In an automobile early today with
two women witnesses, whose names
wore not revealed. It was belloved they
were going to the scene of the shooting,
where the woman who witnessed the
killing could show Just what took place.
The theory that Jealousy may have
been back of the killing of Dllworth la
strengthened .In tho opinion of the po
lice, by the numerous siones mai nave
come to light of his relations with
women.

At this and subsequent meetings
business will be discussed that Is
usually left until nfter opening of
school. In this way all business rela
tive to the opening will be disposed
of before school actually commanoes.
It Is thought this plan will assist In
making up the two weeks lost by the
postponed opening. Should It be found
that the proposed scheme Is practicable,
the permanent opening may be changed
to th first Monday In October.
Since there Is a standard amount of
work required over nearly the entire
country. It will be Interesting to note
what effect the later opening will have
on the schools of the District.

WILSON. PRAISES CONGRESS
i
A glowing tribute was paid today by President Wilson to the work ac
complished by Congress during the session just closed. After re
turning to tho White House from the Capitol, he issued the fol
low statement:
"A very remarkable session of Congress has Just closed, full as alt recent
sessions of Congress have been, of helpful and humane legislation, which
constitutes contributions of capital Importance to the defense, the eco
nomic progress, and the wholesome life of tho country.
"It Is to bo regretted that the session could not have been continued long
enough to complete the program recently projected with regard to the ac
commodation of labor disputes between the railways and the employes, but
It was not feasible In tho circumstances to continue tho session any longer,
and, therefore, only the most Immediately pressing parts of the program
could be completed.
"The rest. It Is agreed, has merely been postponed until It can be more ma
turely deliberated and perfected."
"I have every reason to believe that It la the purpose of the leaders of the two
houses. Immediately upon tho reassembling of Congress, to undertake this
additional legislation.
"It Is evident that the country should bo relieved of the anxiety which must
have been created by recent events with rcgnrd to the future accommoda
tion of such disputes."

House measure looked simply to an
Investigation of wages of wage

The Investigation will be conducted by
the Department of Labor. An appro

Hack of tho legislation Is a movement

The committee consists of Ave mem
bers. Senators Overman, Reed. Walsh,
Nelson and Cummins. The only mem
bers who are in the city are Senators
Reed and Nelson and It Is not likely
that a auorum can be had to under
take the inquiry until after election.
That the Investigation may take on
a wider scope, was hinted at by Sen
ator Chamberlain later. He declared
he believed the time has come for the
country to know Just how far foreign

through diplomatic channels and
commercial agencies, to Influence Con
gressional legislation which affects
this country's foreign trade, with re

Nothing Improper Charged.
"I do not aay there has been anything
Improper In auch acta. I was careful
to explain when I charged existence of
the lobby against the halibut amend
ment that these Canadian officials, so
far as I knew, had not appeared at the
Capitol. My Information Is Just this:
They brought every pressure to bear
upon heads of Government Depart
ments to oppose my amendment.
"I know personally that President
Wilson and every member of his Cabinet

t rotaln It, finally acceaea to mo nousc

"I believe If this Investigation Is
pressed vigorously It will serve as a
stop signal to foreign governments
whoso officials do as Canadian official
did in this case.
"As far as I am concerned. I think
the lime has come when we should call
Great Britain to account for her acts,
said Senator Reed. " Iunderstand the
temper of our Government when I mako
this statement. I believe that the time
Is at hand for us to throw any light pos
sible on this alleged lobby."
