B. P. O. E. TO TACKLE BUNCH OF
OLD TIMERS WHO ONCE WERE
THEIR TEAM PALS
Sunday afternoon the Elks baseball
team and a nine organized by Peter
Kewman and which he calls The All
Stars, will clash for high honors at
the fair grounds. The game will be
called at 3:30 p. m.
The Elks have played two games
already this season and have won both
and they believe that there will be
nothing to copping the game Sunday
but Pete Newman things otherwise.
He is going to pitch for his team and
says that he has not arranged for any
other pitcher either, which can be tak
en to mean that he will stick through
to the end and that he has confidence
in himself although he has not been
in a game of baseball for three or
four years.
For the Elks the lineup will be as
follows: Berg ss, Wetzel cf, Stoll 2b,
Longley 3b, Sylvester lb, Gannon, rf,
T. Johnson If, R. Johnson c, A. Dom
inick p.
As yet Newman is not certain how
liis men will line up but he will have
on the roster Slow Batters, Ed. Lauer
mann, John Kingen, Richard Meyers,
Tat Dunphy and other notables.

(HEARING HELD ON PETITION TO
ESTABLISH BIG REFUGE BE
LOW LITTLE FALLS
A meeting of landowners, sports
men, and others interested in the cre
ation of a game refuge south of Little
Falls, was held at the F. Graham farm
"near Gregory Tuesday afternoon. The
attendance was small, only a few lo
cal men being present and but few
farmers living within the area of the
proposed reserve. Carlos Avery, state
game warden, presided over the hear
ing but he took no action at the time,
announcing that a decision would be
madte later.
As proposed, a game refuge cover
ing twenty-five sections lying between
the Mississippi and Platte rivers,
south of Little Falls, would be estab
lished. This refuge could be made
so for a limited number of years or
permanently, and in either instance,
hunting would not be permitted on
the premises included in the refuge,
nor would any person be permitted to
trespass with dog or gun. In this way
the birds would be unmolested and it
is believed' would propogate very fast.
Mr. Avery states that these refuges
are being established all over the
state and that such steps must be
taken, otherwise the legislature will
put a closed season on hunting in the
entire state before long.
Mr. Avery, while here, urged the
organization of a sportsmen's so
ciety. Local parties will probably
try to organize such a society in the
near future

DISCUSSED STREET MATTERS
WILL BUY ANOTHER OAR
LOAD OF ROAD OIL
The city council held a regular
session at the city hall Tuesday eve
ning, with Aldermen Moeglein, Blake,
Bfrowir, John, LaFond and Farrow
present. Alderman Moeglein, Vice
president, acted as chairman pro tem
in the absence of President Hall. The
meeting was an unusually long one,
lasting until 11 p. m.
A petition signed by residents of
Fifth street southeast, asking that
that street be graded and some ar
rangement made for the disposul of
the surface water, was presented to
the council. The petitioners claim
that the water from the territory east
of them flows down on their property,
causing, considerable damage, especial
ly in the spring of the year. N. N.
Bergheim, speaking for the petition
ers, explained this matter to the coun
cil and he added that the grading of
the street is necessary not only be
cause of the benefit to the property
as regard to water, but it is needed
because of the great amount of travel
on this street. It should be graded
from Fifth avenue northeast to Fifth
avenue southeast, he said. He also
suggested gradi'ng Sixth street and
said that he believed that by so doing
the surplus water trouble 'would be
settled. The street committee and
street commissioner were instructed
to investigate the matter and they
were given power to act.
Frank Griffith appeared before the
council and asked that something be
done to retain the earth along the
bank of the river in the alley at the
rear of his place. The alley ends at
this point and cannot go further. Mr.
Griffith asked that the council, if it
considered the property public domain,
to reclaim it and fix it up, or give him
a right to fix it up at his own expense
and then vacate that part of the al
ley. His reason for wanting the bank
fixed up was that it has been washing
away so that there is now hardly room
for a rig to get into his back yard.
The street committee was instructed
to investigate the matter and report
to the council, so that steps could be
taken to vacate a part of the alley.
Mrs. J. Allescheski, a widow with
out means, appeared before the coun
cil and through her interpreter, Val. E.
Kasparek, asked the council for some
financial aid. She has several chil
dren, one residing here, one at Vir
ginia and one at Ladysmith, Wis., but
all refuse to take care of her. City
Attorney Cameron has written to her
children in the matter. Mrs. Alle
scheski has some property here and
be -accepted at St. Gabriel'-*
hospital but she does not want to do
this as her property would not bring
much and before long she would again
be destitute. The poor committee was
instructed to assist Mrs. Allescheski
until her children are heard from and
some arrangement made for her care.
Jos. Masog and J. H. Johnson of
Seventh street southwest Asked the
council that Seventh street be opened
up as far as the river road. Mr. Ma
sog said that now their children, in
going to school, have to walk about
eight blocks in a roundabout way,
whereas if the street were opened the
distance would only be three blocks.
He said that if the city would clear
the road of brush, etc., the residents
in that vicinity would expend some
of their own money to grade it up. and
put it in shape. The council members
agreed that the street should be open
ed up and the street committee was
instructed to investigate the matter.
Alderman Farrow brought up the
matter of fixing up First street north
east and Victor Schallern, city clerk,
also urged that something be done on
that street. He said that this street,
although it is one of the main thor
oughfares in the city, is the most neg
lected street in the city. No action
was taken by the council, however.
George Emder, chief of the fire de
partment, called the council's atten
tion to the fact that a cover is needed
for the hook and ladder wagon, which
is kept in the alley in back of the
city hall. It was suggested that the
ladders be kept in the city hall and
the truck sold but Mr. Emder said it
is in such poor shape, that nothing
could be realized from the sale of it.
The matter was referred to the fire
comittee with power to act.
Mr. Emder also called the coun
cil's attention to a complaint about
the piling of wood in back of the
new Vasaly block by the Vasaly
Realty company. He said that if one
is to be stopped from this practice,
all must be, and a number would be
affected. The councilmen were of the
opinion that a pile of wood would not
be such a great fire hazard as old
sheds, etc., in back of buildings, and
all agreed that it is absolutely neces
sary to have fuel. The council decid
ed to pass over the matter.
Several bills were laid over. 0»e
was for $12.50 for a casket and box
for Ed. Gleason. Only a casket had
been authorized by the alderman who
issued the order. Three bills of Phil.
Randall, city engineer, amounting
in all to $181.00, were laid aside as
the council felt that they were ex
horbitant. A bill from St. Gabriel's
hospital for $42.00 for the care of
Albert Olson was laid over because
the city physician had not authorized
anyone to take said patient to the
hospital.
Fire Chief Emder asked that some
more hose be purchased for the fire
department. There are only 2,600 feet"
of hose at the city hall, he said, and
the law requires that at least 2,000
feet be carried on the fire truck alone
in order to keep the city in the
fourth class. He urged the council
to1 buy at least a thousand feet of
single' jacket hose, The matter was
left until the next meeting.
•C. B. Buckman was granted a per
mit to construct a cement walk along
his property on Third street south!-.

SIXTH DISTRICT DEMOCRATIC
CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE
MET HERE MONDAY
A well attended meeting of the de
mocratic congressional committee of
this district was held Monday after
noon at the Baciunan hotel, with
Harvey Grimmer of St. Cloud
presiding.
Matters pertaining to the campaign
were taken up for discussion and the
situation as expressed by those pres
ent from tne different counties
'showed an excellent opportunity for
the success of the congressional
candidate
Hon. William F. Donahue, candi
date of the party in the district, gave
the committee most encouraging re
ports of the tenders of support that
are being received daily. He has. been
assured"'Of support froiit most iftiVs/
pected quarters, and many of the
most prominent republicans of the

It was felt that the settlement of
the threatened railroad strike by a
democratic president and- a demo
cratic congress—the question having
been made a partisan one by the
practically solid vote against the pre
venting a strike by the republican
senate, including the two Minnesota
senators—would create an- unusually
friendly sentiment in favor of Mr.
Donohue througout his district. A
telegram congratulating the- president
on his successful efforts in behalf of
the working people and the public
generally was forwarded to the presi
dent by the officers of the committee,
as follows:
Little Falls, Minn., Sept 4, 1916.
To the President, White House, Wash
ington, D. C.:
The Democratic Congressional com
mittee of the Sixth Minnesota dis
trict, in session here today, extends
heartiest congratulations ob your suc

railroad strike, with all its attendant
miseries.
The Democrats of Minnesota hope
to give you the electoral vote of tne
state as a matter of simple justice.
We know that thousands of men of
Other parties join- in the spirit of this
message.
—Harvey W. Grimmer, Chairman,
—E. W. Swenson, Secretary.
An appeal to the voters of the dis
trict in behalf of-Mr. Donohue was
presented and endorsed by the full
committee. It will appear later.
An advisory committee headed by
Dr. J. A.. DuBois of Sauk Center, who
led thej democratic fight two years
ago for congress in the Sixth district,
was announced. It includes one or
more leading democrats of each

It was reported from Walker, Cass
county, that a strong Donohue club
had been organized there, and had
pledged its best efforts to the work
of advancing Donohue's interests in
Cass county. Other clubs having for
their purpose the promotion of the
Melrose man's candicfocy are in the
making.
Mr. Donohue will open his campaign
on the evening of September 8, hav

before the Donohue club at Walker.

IN CENTRAL SECTION AT STATE
FAIR—WADENA GETS
FIRST PLACE
Morrison county came out thirl in.
the Central section at the state fair
this year, her exhibit scoring 976
points out of a possible 1200, three
points higher than Todd county, which
was fourth There were only four
counties in the central section which
competed. Wadena county ot the
first prize, scoring 1,027%. Cass coun
ty, in the northern section, won the
state trophy, with a score of 1055.
Washington county got the first prize
for beauty in this section.
The showing mad'e by Morrison
county is considered good, in view
of the poor growing season. Although
it has not been possible to obtain the
scores^ on the individual exhibits, it
is believed that the corn, potato and
fruit exhibits and miscellaneous
scored high, but that the grains did
not show up so well.
Messrs. A. H. Larson of the local
high school and Verne steward of
Royalton high put on the exhibit, de
voting a great deal of time to the
work, and to them is due much credit
for the showing Morrison county
made, as well as to those who furnish
ed' the material for the exhibit.
Following are the names of the
counties that had exhibits at the fair
and their score and prizes:
Northern Division
First—Cass, 1,055 out of possible
1,200 cup and $265.
Second—Kittson, 1,037 $225.
Third—Beltrami, 1,035 $210.
Fourth—Itasca, 986 $200.
