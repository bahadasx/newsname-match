THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
To a considerable extent this has been
another eventful week in the European
war. Whiter the Russian advance has
not made much if any progress there
has been some sanguinary fighting in
Galicia. The Italian campaign appears
to have developed into an artillery duel.
The Boumanian-Bulgar frontiers have
been the scene of some severe conflicts
with successes for both sides but noth
ing decisive for either.
Greece seems to be in a political chaos,
Bulgarians are within her borders and
taking territory. The French and Eng
lish appear to be assuming many of the
powers of the regular government and
arresting German agents whom they call
spies.
One of the greater contests of the war
has occurred since Sunday on the Somm*
front. Probably 250,000 men have been
engaged on each side and include the
flower of the German army. The fight*
ing was on a front of about thirty miles
and the entente allies progressed from
half to a whole mile at most points. The
battle is still raging at many places.
The allies now claim that they have suc
ceeded in gaining practically all of the
second line of German trenches for
which they started on the first of July.
It is quite probable that this drive of
the ententes has two objects one to gain
ground in front of them and the other
to prevent the Teutons,from sending re
inforcements from France to the Austria
an-Hunganan armies which are undoubt
edly being hard pushed on the long line
in the east, and which was so largely
extended iast week by the entrance of
Roumania into the war.
There may or may not be some signifi
cance in the comparison of the drive of
the Germans on Verdun and the drive
of the French-English on the Somme.
Both drives were successful at the start
and each gained about the same amount
of territory. But the Germans notwith
standing most terrific assaults for sever
al months were not able to pass a certain"
line and later news is that the French
are not only on the agressive there but
have made some substantial gains.
On the other hand, the French-Eng
lish forces on the Somme who began on
the.first of July have boen slowly advan
cing most of the time since in spite of
very strong resistance, and as we have
said, during the last three days have
made a very substantial advance along
a wide front,
It would look as if General Joffrie be
lieved that the time has come when he
should change his tactics of defense to
those of offense. That he believes that
the Teutons are abput exhausted and
that the time to squeeze them is now.
We are not trying to say whether his
conclusions are right or wrong, but just
noting what seems to be apparent, that
Joffre thinks so.
AH things point however, to a boat
vigorous clashing of the immense armed
forces within the nextiew months and
that the watchfully waiting period will
develop into the most desperate fight
ing of the war along all the long lines.
That is the real situation of all the na
tions at war after two yean of drainage

of men, mrtuy and monitions. In onr
opinion war could not be oontinued in
its present proportions for another
twelve months. It would collapse from
very exhaustion of many of the contend
ing countries.
THE RAILWAY STRIKE.
We are writing this on a national
holiday, Labor Day.
The nation is rejoicing today because
a vast railway strike has been called off.
A large number of laboring men are
rejoicing because, they have won a great
victory.
But every thinking man of both class
es is this morning wondering wondering
what the results will be. While the
man may well rejoice that the strike is
called off he is asking the question,
what wilt be the end ,of this? Where
are we at?
Every man knows that tlw notions of
the President and of Congress .were but
the choice of evils. We have the same
feelings that has the victim of a burglar
or a highwayman. We have been forced
to give up our money to save our lives.
When
the highway robber gets the
drop on his victim there is only one
thing for the victim to do, there is no
time for argument.
When the affair is over, perhaps it
may be found that the victim has lost
but little cash and that part cuts but
little figure* but nobody likes to be held
up.
That is the feeling that prevades this
United States today.
It is not the question whether the
trainmen of the four brotherhoods were
entitled to a raise of one-fourth in their
pay, because as far as the people were
ooncerned they never had an opportu
nity to deoide on the merits of that
question. The brotherhoods denied all
question they decided the answer and
enforced the reply—because they had
the power. The issue was the power of
the brotherhoods and the power of~ the
government.
And the President of these United
States and the House Representatives
and the Senate of the United States got
down on their knees, held up their hands
and passed a drastic law of doubtful
constitutionality—before six o'clock on
Saturday night—as they were ordered
to do by the brotherhoods. And these
men. in supposed authority-turned over
their lawful functions to a gang of
strikers representing two out of each
hundred voters of the whole country.
Now don't get mixed about this con
troversy. This is not a question as to
whether the trainmen should or should
not get ten hours pay for eight hours
work. That is still a question notwith
standing Congress has made it a law.
It will always be a question until all
conditions are investigated.
But there is no question about the
manner in which that law was forced
upon the American people without their
knowledge or consent.
While the "Adamson bill" was passed
almost solely on party lines we believe
that the Democratic members of both
houses of Congress would have voted
against any such arbitrary and hasty
aotion if they had dared to do it. We
also believe that if it had been necessary
to pass the bill that there would have
been a good many Republican members
of both houses who would have voted
for it. That is that the recorded votes
dd not represent the private opinions so
much as the force of circumstances.
As predicted by the Pioneer Express
last week this issue has become political.
Congress on the face of the vote divided
on political lines. The Democratic par
ty is by this congressional action and
compelled by-the acts of President Wil
son have joined the trainmen of the four
brotherhoods. The Republicans by
their votes have protested against arbi
trary law-making under the threats of a
labor union.
That this issue may grow until it be
comes the one great issue between the
parties is very possible. It will be an
important issue in this present campaign
and in th? campaign of four years hence
it may be the controlling issue. It may
be that the brotherhoods have begun
that ^'irrepressible conflict" of labor and
capital that has been impending for the
last twenty-tive years. But in this im
pending war there is yet a third party
who do not belong to either the laborers
or the capitalists. They are that class
of independent workers who do not de
pend on others for salaries or day wages,
or the classes that do work for others
but singly or in small groups. The most
numerous of this third party at interest
are the farmers and smaller business
and professional men.
In illustrating the case above we do
not wish to be understood that the
brotherhoods are highwaymen in the
sense pf dishonesty. The highwayman
is taking that which is not bis own by
fojrce. The brotherhood trainman is
taking that what he thinks is bis by
force. The brotherhoods think
right to.foiee the giving of this
by might. If the latter prinoiplp pre
vails what becomes of the government
of the United States?
It is at this method of law-making at
whioh the people of this republic stand
aghsst The real question tbatoones
before the people this Labor Day mann
ing is "whether any body of men, large
or small, shall be permitted to dictate to
this government, and compel it to piss
laws for their own benefit—befoz* six
