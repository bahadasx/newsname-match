Without doubt the largest crowd
ever assembled In the Clifton-Mo-

on Labor Day to do honor to the
workinginan and enjoy the sports of
the day which had been arranged for
their pleasure. A conservative esti
mate has placed the number of peo
ple presnt at ,900 during 'the day.
Early in the morning two special
trains brought hundreds of - cele
brants from Morenci and one from
Metcalf swelled the total by several
hundred more, until by noon the
streets were thronged with thousands

Several thefts or loss of watches

There was no hitch in the arrange

In honor of the occasion the major
ity of the business houses along the
line of march had been ' profusely
decorated with flags and bunting, and
the bridge across the Frisco river
was also bedecked with . streamers
and flags of the national colors.
To many the parade was the'---big
feature-of the day and long before
the time for formation Chase Creek
was congested-by the thousands of
workingmen of "the different crafts
who were waiting to be assigned ' to
their sections in the line of march.
Nearly every craft In the district was
represented and they made a fine ap

uniforms, between 4,000; end 5,000 men
being in line. The parade started on
Chase Creek and was preceded by

The teamsters union was represent
ed by a beautiful float drawn by four
large gray horses which were gaily
caparisoned, the float being occupied
by the members of the union. The
float of the Carpenter's Union con
tained a miniature house built by the
carpenters and. a complete reproduc
tion. The house was occupied by a
bevy of little boys and girls who
made themselves at horn.
The Boilermakers were represent
ed by a float which contained a large
engine boiler and a forge fired up
for business. Four boilermakers were
industriously driving rivets and plying
their trade along the line and made
a decided hit. The saw mill depart
ment was represented by a float on
which a circular saw was at work,
the motive power bing furnished by
direct drive from the hub of the
wagon. The railroad department
float was occupied' by a miniature of
a box car which was perfect in every
respect, no detail being left out. The
Vienna Bakery was represented by a
beautifully decorated wagon which
contained several little children seat
ed at a table and enjoying an
imaginary feast of the good things
which are turned out by the bakery.
A. large and handsomely decorated
float loaded with Mexican girls repre

The various crafts on foot made an
excellent showing and it would be a
hard matter to justly draw a com

Fellow Citizens
In being honored with an invitation
to address the workers of the Clifton
Morenci-Metcalf district on that day
of the. year which is dedicated solely
to labor, I cannot feel otherwise than
deeply conscious of the ! priceless
tribute paid me as Governor of Ari
zona. These - familiar surroundings
and the presence in this audience
before me of hundreds of well-known
faces, bring distinctly to memory the
Incidents of my last visit in this dis
trict, when the wheels of industry
were stilled -and five thousand work
; ingmen Were 'marking a valiant fight
for those inalienable rights which are
guaranteed by their Nation's Con
stitution. It is so unusual for the
Governor of a State in which a seri
ous strike' has recently been conclud
ed, to be on speaking terms with the
workers whose rights were at issue.
that I might, perhaps, be justified to
day in taking a certain pride in this
manifest achievement. Such, how
ever, as I can earnestly assure you,
is not my mental attitude, notwith
standing any honest satisfaction
which I may feel in having exercised
my opportunity, officially and person
ally, to be just to the workers of
the Clifton-Morenci-Metcalf district in
! their courageous struggle for the fu-
the security of posterity. That five
months' conflict between employer
and employee did not, fortunately, un
duly embitter either one faction or the
other, but paved the way, as I be
lieve, for an era of better understand
ing between capital and labor. You
men who underwent the serious
harships of that contest, staking your
all upon the integrity and endurance
of your fellows, did not, perhaps, fully
realize at the time that the eyes of
a whole nation were witnessing your
championship of human rights. Even
at this day, when the Clifton-Morenci-
Metcalf strike is rapidly becoming a
memory of the past, it is doubtful
whether you fully realize the magni
tude and far-reaching importance of
the precedent which you nave set
for the workers of the world's great
est country to follow hereafter in such
industrial disputes as may develop.
While the successful outcome of
your struggle was not the result of
any individual's effort, but was,
rather, a natural consequence of un
precedented co-operation between the
workers, employers, State otnciais ana
Federal mediators, the originality of
the methods pursued was due, after
all, to the workmen who contended
for their rights amid these scenes
which environ us today. Whereas, a
strike, in the usual accepted sense
of the term, connotes violence on
the part of the workers, bitter re
prisals on the part of the employer
and disastrous intervention by public
officials and hired soldiers, the Clifton-Morenci-Metcalf
strike was scarce
ly characterized at all by any of
these menacing conditions. In the
first place, it was the workers them
selves who surprised the nation by
conducting their protest against
wrongful, industrial conditions by
keeping the peace, protecting prDi-ci-ty
and safeguarding the live--: cf un
offending residents. The krtor.r
therefore, and it was a victory, '-vis
yours, and yours oniy. me resi w
us who were concerned In the strug-
trie by virtue of the official duties
placed upon us, deserve credit merely
for following the dictates, of con
science and humanity by refusing to
place dollars above the dignity of
honest toil, and property rights above
those priceless human rights whic h
must always have precedence" in the
social equation.

John L. Donnelly, First Vice-PresU

tlon of Labor Causes Disturbance
and is Placed Under Peace Bond
of $3,000. Waives Hearing.
About 3 o'clock Friday morning ot
last- week at his home in North Clif
ton John L. Donnelly, vice president
of the Arizona State Federation of
Labor who has been stationed 1 in
this district for " some ' time, ran
amuck and created a disturbance
which resulted in his being tola
week placed under a $3,000 peace
bond by Justice J. A. McWilliams.
threats are alleged to have been made'
was the -complaining witness.
It seems that for some time there
had been bad blood between Donnelly
and Wood and the climax of their -troubles
was reached - on Friday
morning when Donnelly took the mat
ter up with apparently nearly serious
consequences.
The case was brought for hearing
before Justice McWilliams on Wed
nesday morning at 10 o'clock, when
M r . Donnelly accompanied by his
wife, were present and heard the
charges read. . Mr. Wood, who swore
out the complaint, failed to appear.
On reading the complaint Justice Mc
Williams informed Mr. Donnelly that
ha had tha ricrht fnr nnnnnnl If hn
so desired. Donnelly waived hearing
ana .was placed under a $3,000 peace (
bond, .G. A. Franz and C. W. Young
being accepted as bondsmen.
The complaint in full follows and
tells the story of the alleged threats
made by Donnelly upon the person
of Wood and his family:
. Before-me, J. A. McWilliams, Jus
tice of the Peace, thiB 2nd . day of
' September, 1916, personally appeared
;K. A. Wood, who first being duly
: sworn, on oath complains and accus
es John L. Donnelly, of threatening
to murder complainant and threaten
ing to blow up the dwelling house of
complainant with dynamite, as fol
, lows, to-wit: The said J. L. Don
nelly on or about the 1st day of Sep
tember, 1916, in Greenlee County,
State of Arizona, did , awaken com
plainant and his wife about 3 o'clock
A. M. and then and there said J. L.
Donnelly woile armed with a... .Win
chester rifle, - stood in the public
street of Clifton, In said County and -State,
immediately in front of ' affi
ants front door and profanely and
abusively . threatened to wilfully,
knowingly, maliciously, forcibly,
feloniously and with malice ' afore
thought and premeditatedly . shoot,
kill, slay and murder complainant
and did then and there threaten to
blow up complainants said dwelling
with dynamite; that said J. L. Don- '
nelly presented himself in said
street as aforesaid while clad in his
underwear alone again about the
same hour on said date and as afore
said and repeated said threats in the
presence and hearing of women and
children in said neighborhood of
North Clifton; that for said offense
said J. L. Donnelly has not been
placed under arrest nor in any man
ner restrained by the officers of the
law, though they have been fully ad
vised of said conduct on the part of -said
J. L. Donnelly.
That by reason of said threats, as
aforesaid, and Baid demonstrations
as aforesaid. comDlainant fears and
has reason to fear that said J. L.
Donnelly will in execution of said
threats, take complainants life and
that ot his wife with dynamite and
complainant has reason tobelieve and
does believe that said J. L. Don
nelly will murder complainant and
his wife and destroy his said dwelling
and all of his property therein as
threatened aforesaid and that . said
J. L. Donnelly will execute said
threats unless he is restrained from
so doing, by this court. That to pre
vent said J. L. Donnelly from putting
said threats into execution it is nec
essary that said J. L. Donnelly be
placed under bond, by this Court, as
the law provides, requiring him, as
provided by law in such cases, to
keep the peace toward the State of
Arizona and toward this complainant
in particular.
Complainant therefore prays that a
warrant may be issued for the arrest
of said J. L. Donnelly and that he
may be dealt with according to law.
Cowboy Dance
Quite a number of ranchmen and
cowboys were In town the first of
the week, their visit being primari
ly to take in the Labor Day cele
bration, but not being satisfied with a
day and night's gaiety they decided to
wind the celebration up with a good
old fashioned dance. On Tuesday a
few of the older heads among the cow
men got busy, secured the Princess
theatre for the occasion and that
evening to the accompaniment oC
clanking spurs and rustling chaps
they enjoyed the merryVhirl until a
late hour Wednesday morning. Music
was furnished by one of their number
on the violin while W. H. Moon,
whose versatility is unlimited, accom
panied him on the piano. Everyone
enjoyed themselves immensely and
the home people were looked after In
a royal manner by their hosts. May
the cowboys' hospitality nver wane
1 and their step never grow heavy.
