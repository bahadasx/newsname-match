Inasmuch as the Phelan pro

Legislation Ended All
Too Soon.
WASHINGTON. Sept. V Pres't
"Wilson this afternoon lauded the
work of congress during the session
just closed and at the same time
served notice on the departing leg
islators that he would insist upon
passage of his recent strike prevent,
ive legislation program in the early
days of the next session.
The president issued the following
statement:
"A very remarkable session of
congress has jml closed, full, as all
recent sessions of the congress have
been, of helpful and humane legis
lation which constituted contribu
tions of a capital importance to the
defense, the economic progress and
the wholesome life of the country.
"It is to be regreatted that the
session could not have been con
tinued longe enough to complete
the program recently projected
with regard to the accommodations
of labor disputes between the rail
ways and the employes, out it was
not feasible in the circumstances to
continue the session any longer and
therefore only the most immediately
pressing parts of the program could
be completed. The rest. it is
agreed, has merely been postponed
until it can be more maturely de
liberated ind perfected. I hav
every reason to believe that it is th
purpose of the leaders of the two
houses immediately upon the reas
sembling of congress to undertake
this additional legislation. It is
evident that the country should tie
relieved of the anxiety which must
have been created by recent events
with regard to the future accommo
dation of such disputes."
Financing the Indiana Centennial
Celebration
The method of financing Si. Joseph county's great Indiana cen
tennial celebration to be held in South Bend Oct. 3, 4 and 5 is in
teresting. This is the tirst time this method has been used in this
city tor tinancing any public all air of more than ordinary conse
quence. A celebration was suggested more than a year ago and the
Chamber of Commerce got back of the suggestion. When the im
portance and magnitude of the undertaking were fully appreciated
an organization named the South Bend's Indiana Centennial asso
ciation was incorporated under the Indiana lavs with an existence
of one year. The directors are, J. D. Oliver, C. B. Stephenson, C.
C. Hauch, E. Louis Kuhns, Rev. Dr. C A. Lippincott, C. C. Herr,
A. Frank. Mayor F. W. Keller, George H. Wheelock, E L. Burch.
F. L. Dennis." John Henry Zuver, Albert V. Weigel. F. B. Barnes
and F. A. Miller. The officers are Mr. Miller, president; Mr. Step
henson, vice president; Mr. Weigel, secretary, and Mr. Burch,
treasurer. All serve without remuneration.
To nnance the comprehensive undertaking ii was decided to
create a guarantee fund of $20,000. A guarantee subscription form
was devised which provided that signers would not be holden tor
the amount opposite their names until the full amount ot $2o,oou
lias been subscribed. In other words if the S20,ooo guarantee
could not be secured then every guarantee would be void. This
guarantee is simply a promise to pay the amount guaranteed should
ic be needed. If "the weather is pleasant Oct. 3. 4 and 5 and the
historical pageant on those evenings is patronized as it will merit,
which means that every one of 10,000 seats will be occupied, the
guarantors of this guarantee fund will not be asked for a cent.
On this guarantee fund are subscriptions for S 1,000, for S5oo,
for S200 and for SI 00 from persons and tirms whose loyalty to
Indiana and whose pride in St. Joseph county have prompted them
to act. realizing: that the centennial is to e the greatest public
event in the history of the county. It any persons in St. Joseph
county are actuated by equal loyalty and pride their names on this
guarantee fund will be most welcome and they should at mice
notify centennial headquarters in the Chamber of Commerce.

were bred in the strike of traction
employes today for the first time.
The target was a train tin the !th

the 50th .st. station. .lust as the
molorman brought the train to a
stop four shots were jired at it
from the roof of a nearby house.
None of the passenger.-- or train
crew was injured, but they were
panic-stricken. Bushing from the
train, both passengers and workers
took refuge in tie- station until as
sured there was no further danger.
Shortly afterward two more
trains on the same elevated line
were bombarded with bottles near
4 4th st. Several windows in the
train were broken and a passenger
was cut by dying glass.
Hoofs Arc Searched.
These attacks on the elevated
trains were followed ay a thorough
search of roofs along the thorough
fare, but the police captured no
prisoners. Fearing that further
disorder might occur it wa-s order
ed that patrolmen be stationed on
n.j roofs in each block, while a
squad of detectives was sent from
headquarters to make a house to
house search for the persons who
had thrown the missiles.
The general 'situation on the sub
way and elevated lines was un
changed today. The trains were
running on practically schedule
time bearing out the reiterated
statements of the Interborough

strike was a failure. On the sur

Menihers of the Mexican commis
