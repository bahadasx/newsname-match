Hitting Their Own Candidate
The democratic state convention
took an awful wallop at Col.
Gardner, their candidate for gover
nor, when they declared themselves
in favor of a law compelling
holders of hidden wealth to return
same to the assessor for taxation
purposes." -
On the 12th day of February,
1913, Col. Gardner, when signing
bonds in the federal court, made
an affidavit that he was the owner
of $1,000,000 worth of personal
property, free and clear of all liens
and incumbrances. In the same
year Col. Gardner returned to the
assessor in St. Louis a personal
property tax list of only $2,600. i
Should a democratic administra
tion endeavor to unearth hidden
wealth for the purposes of taxation
they would do well to begin with
their own candidate for governor.
