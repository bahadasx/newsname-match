"There haa been no time within the

In a more or less careless way. It Is
profitable In spile of hla carelessness
There was a time when sheep were
kept primarily for wool, but now. be
cause of the Increase In consumption
of mutton and the prices realised, the
mutton consideration stands first.
"I find that sheep properly handled
are the best paying animals on my
farm, considering the Initial invest

Preliminary work la now In progress
toward the establishment of an Inde
pendent oil refinery at some location
In Kentucky and the selection of. a alto
will be decided upon within a few day
according to David U'Mellck, who Is
tha prime mover In this Important ven
ture. The company haa received Its
charter from the Secretary of State
for the purpose of refining crude oil,
laying pipe line and operating for oil

the company which 1 styled. The Mel

The oil run for the week ending Au

approximately 18.000 barrel for the
week. Thl amount of oil over the
Cumberland pipe line la considerably
less than was anticipated after the
completion of the supplementary 4
Inch line. Officials of the company stat
ed that the additional facilities would
enable them to handle (,600 barrels

capacity. The runs In the future wilt
therefore be about 4.000 barrels dully
on an average and hardly sufficient re

The "mysterious" well on the Kb

some extent Wednesday when the

! MOUNTAIN GIRL MAKES
FIRST VISIT TO CITY
Here In the way the Louisville Time
write up a girl from the mountain! of
Eastern Kentucky on her first visit to
city:
j If a girl of 18, of unusual beauty, In
; tellect and refinement, should have
'gone t sleep a hundred years ago and
had Just awakened she would doubtless
. T!l "VT.,ni.v experienced the sumo sensation
a MibS Mary Combs, who has recently
been visiting In Louisville.
The mountain of Eastern Kentucky
have Indeed played a strange part In
the life of the native. As barriers
they have kept Intact and preserved
the. purest Anglo-Saxon people, who
cherish the same traditions, superstl
tions, customs and language of old
Elizabethan England.
Mis Comb wa born and reared In
Clay-co Ky, forty mile from a rail
road, and where the steep, rough moun
tain road have bad little improvement.
On thl account many of the native
have seen little of the outside world,
When Ml Comb started to Louis
ville she had never seen a railroad.
Thl Implies also that she had never
seen the improvement and Inventions
of the past hundred years. Her per
sonality and charm of manner would
lead a stranger to believe that she had
enjoyed every advantage of city life.
For the first time she saw steam en
gines, automobiles, street cars, eleva
tors, tall buildings, paved streets, elec
tric lights, gas lights and hundreds of
other things too numerous to mention.
This case Is not an exceptional one.
for hundreds of persons In Clay-co.,
grown to middle and old age, have seen
none of the Invent Ions of the past cen
tury and know nothing of the modern
methods of living. These piu.ple have
made Utile progress, living in practi
cally tlio same manner as their ancea
Urs, who biased the way through Cum
berland Clap from Virginia and North
Carolina.
After a thirteen hours' ride in a Jolt
wagon, Minn Combs reached East Bern
atadt, where, for the first time, she saw
a railroad, She went from there to Crab
Orchard, where she waa brought to
Louisville by Mr. and Mrs. Claude Mat
lack In their automobile, the first she
had ever seen or ridden In. Then, step
by step, the progress and inventions of
modern times, of which Bhe had read
but never seen, were unfolded to her.
Level fields of hemp and bluegrass
stretching for mile were a revelation
to her. In amazement she gazed upon
the modern farming implements, silos,
auto trucks, carriages and ether im
provements never seen by one impris
oned by the mountains.
She gradually saw something of city
life In passing through Danville, Har
rodsburg, Lexington, Frankfort and In
to Louisville. Here she spent several
days In visiting factories, churches,
theaters, park and enjoying everything
that appeals to a normal 18-year-old
girl.
Miss Comb I a senior In the Oneida
Baptist Institute, a school founded and
fostered by "Burns of the Mountains,"
who Is devoting his life to the educa
tion and enlightenment of the moun
tain people. He has been the main In
strument In stopping : the feuds, and
through hla system of christian educa
tion is making it possible for the pres
ent generation to live different lives
from their forefathers and to get out
of the mountain fastnesses and see
how the world Is progressing.

McCOY RETURNS
FROM THE WEST.
Mr. J. J. McCoy made a pleasant call
at the Big Sandy New office Tuesday.
He is a very Interesting gentleman. In
spite of his 78 years he Is active In body
and mind. He is bright and witty and
takes a lively interest in affairs of ev
ery kind. He is a native of Martin-co.
A few years ago he moved toWoshlngton
and bought a form. Unlike most peo
ple who go to the far west, he is very
frank about that country. He says It
has beon pronely exaggerated, The land
is adapted to very limited uses. It Is
not adapted to a great variety of crops.
as this part of the country Is. Mr. Mc
Coy and his wife will probably remain
In Kentucky, which Is good enough for
them. They have been at Gallup vis
iting Harvey Hardin. Sr., who was
their neighbor for many years In Mar
tin county. Mrs. McCoy's last visit to
Kentucky was In 1907 and Mr. Mc
Coy's In 1911.

PAVED ROAD FROM
WAYNE TO KENOVA.
For a dato some time prior to Janu
ary 1, and probably before December
1, the county court of Wayne county
acting upon petition, will submit bond
elections for one of the most Import
ant road Improvement projects ever
undertaken in West Virginia. This
scheme involves the construction of a
paved highway or hard road of other
acceptable material from Wayne court
house, in the heart of Wayne county,
to the paved road at Ceredo, thus giv
ing the people not only of the town of
Wayne, but those of a stretch of the
fertile Twelve Pole valley twenty-five
miles long, easy market outlet to Hunt

the advantages of better school, church,
mall and social ' facilities generally
than they now have.
To secure this roadway would re

gospel In Wayne county before and for
a few years after the civil war.
There are not many people yet liv
ing who remember Rev. Burwell Spur
lock well. He was born in 1788 and
came from Greenbrier with his father
at an early age. He waa a man of ex
ceptional Intellect and, without oppor
tunity for systematic schooling, read
and studied until he was deeply learn
ed. He waa an Itinerant Methodist
preacher, known throughout the moun
tains aa a flaming light ot righteous
ness. Even after the war, when he was old,
he continued to preach and work among
his neighbors. He died in Wayne In
1879 at the age of eighty-nine years.
In his rides through the mountains
he used saddle bags, and when his rid
ing days were over, he gave hla sad
dlebags to Judge James H. Ferguson,
another mental giant Judge Ferguson
used the bags until the time of his
death, upon which he gave them to Ma-
Jor Joseph Chilton,, of Charleston.
During his visit to Charleston this
week, young Mr. Spurlock came into
contact with Major Chilton, who soon
learned that he was Rev. Burwell
Spurlock's grandson.
Saying that he bod something In
which he would be Interested to see
Major Chilton took the visitor to hlB
home and showed him the saddlebags.
The Incident ended In the presentation
of the saddlebags to the grandson of
the original owner. It Is believed that
these saddlebags are at least 100 years
old. Huntlngton-Herald.

PUBLICAN, GIVES REAS
ONS FOR 8UPPORT.
Saratoga, N. Y Sept 3. Thomas A.
Edison, lifelong Republican and a
strong supporter of Roosevelt's can
didacy for the Republican nomination,
made announcement today of his In
tention to vote and work for Woodrow
Wilson. He gave out the following
statement:
Not since 1860 has any campaign
made such a direct call of simon pure
Americanism; the times are too ser
ious to talk or think In terms of re
publicanism or democracy. Real Amer
icans must drop parties and get down
to big fundamental principles.
"More than any other President In
my memory Wilson has been faced by
a succession of tremendous problems,
any one of which decided the wrong
way would have had disastrous conse
quences. Wilson's decisions so far have
not got us into any serious trouble, nor
are they likely to.
He has given us peace with honor.
This talk about the United States being
despised Is nonsense. Neutrality is a
mighty trying policy, but back of it are!
International law, the rights of hu
manity and the future of civilization.
"With reference to Mexico, I think
that the President has acted wisely,
lustlv and cnurAcrenunlv. Tt waa rtirhf
that the United States should not have.qu,m a,la a numDer or merchants have
recognized such a murderous personal

AGED PRI80NER WANTS JUSTICE.
Would Have Court Hear The Fact of
Killing Don Forty-four
Year Ago.
The Williamson, (W. Va.,) Republi
can says:
Andrew Wise Is to return to Bun-combe-co..
North Carolina and stand
trial for the alleged killing of J. C.
Rogers there forty-four years ago. Al
though he has lived almost the allotted
span Wise desires to satisfy any pun
ishment "that may be meted out to
him by the law of the land. His five
children, useful and respected citizens,
entertain the same feeling.
There was some talk Wednesday that
Wise might resist extradition. It being
stated that there was no Indictment
against him in the North Carolna-co.
It Is not likely that this ccurse wIU be
pursued. '
It waa understood that an officer from ;
Buncombe-co. Is enroute to William-jjp
son to take charge oi the aged prison- l(js
This case is another Illustration of
the so-called long arm of the law. It
has now been forty-four yeors since
the alleged victim, J. C. Rogers,, was
slain, probably the longest time on reo
ord between the alleged commission of
a capital crime and the bringing of the
accused to trial. The case is arousing
great Interest over the entire country.
From North Carolina it is learned
that on the night of the killing, prob
ably about this season of the year, 1872,
Wise and Rogers with others were at
a cane mill where molasses were being
made. This mill was located about
midway between the homes of Wise
and Rogers. "
Some time during the night. It Is
alleged by the North Carolina authori
ties, Rogers became enraged because
somebody kicked his dog. Accusing
Wise, Rogers rushed at him, being arm
ed with a heavy wooden bucket
There were two other men present,
It is alleged. In the fight that followed
Rogers was struck or cut about the
temple with a knife and some time la
ter died from the woupd. One of the
other men, Lewis Miles, died many
years ago and the other by the name
of Donohue disappeared and never was "
heard from again.
Whilo Wise refuses to discuss his
case it is stated that he did not know
he was wanted for the alleged crime
until arrested. It Is stated that he vis
ited North Carolina during the year
1915 and that for many years his rel
atives kept up correspondence with
relatives ni Buncombe-co.
Something of the career of Wise will
be of interest to our readers as he was
for forty-years a resident of the Big
Sandy valley. When he came to the
valley shortly after the killing of Rog
ers he first located In Pikeville where,
he remained three years.
Next Wise went ot the mouth bf the
Big Sandy, where Catlettsburg now
stands, remaining there only a few
months. He took employment on the
farm of Ex-Senator John T. York,,
father of Dr. William York and Attor
ney A. Blaine York, of this city. This:
farm was located In the vicinity of the1
Falls of Tug River and there Wise met
and married Elizabeth Lackey. He re
mained around the farm until 1892.
In 1892 Wise moved to Mlngo-cou '
spending most of the years since then
either In Williamson or Nolan. He was
often In the employe of the railroad
company as section man and other
wise and was a good steady worker.
He is the father of seven children, five
of whom are living.
It was stated at the time of his ar
rest that Wise's former wife, whom he
divorced eipht years ago, caused his
arrest but the children state that this
is not true. The mother has been liv
ing with the son who is a farmer In
Monroe-co. and did not know anything
tintii after the arrest was made. It
seems that Stephen Rogers, son of J.
C. Rogers, was the instigator of the
proceedings.
Wise bears the very best of reputa
tions here. He was always sober and
spoken highly of his Integrity. His
children are also very highly respect
ed. The living children are:
