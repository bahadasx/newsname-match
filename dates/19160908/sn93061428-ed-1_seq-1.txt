PERSONEL STATE TICK
ET. WEIL DISTRI
BUTED OVER
STATE.
Santa Fe. Sept. 5. The expected
has happened. The emocratic party
has na mod a splendid state ticket and
gone before the people of the state
confident that its action will le rat
fiid in the most decisive manner at
the polls on November 7.
The Democratic ticket is absolu
tely unavailable. Not candidate
on it h seeking "vindicatdion." Not
a canidute on it has an ugly cficial
record, -ith a history of removal f rora
office by an executive of his own
party because of ltd. There are no
tools of the Invisible Government
in the liet; no representatives of
corporate greed and unequal taxation
no violator of ballot boxea and pil
ferers election; no framero of
vicious legislation and promoter! of
junecrupious politics. Nothing; , but
clean, honest, capable, efficient Am
eriaane, who have achieved success
and renouwn, and who stand four
- square to the wind of public opinion.

strength at the head of the ticket.
In place besides him, as the eon
sjreasioaal nominee, is State Sena
te William B. Walton, of Grant
county, a man who for years has
been one of the most earnest and de
termined workers for the Democrat
ic party in his county and in his
state, and who haj been repeated
ly honored by the people of his dis
trict, and who is particularly qualified
to represent New Mexico in the low
er house of Congress. "You have
nominated for Congress," the state
executive told the convention," a man
who wiU carry the banner of Democ
racy as few men can carry it."
In nominating Exequiel C. de Baca,
of San Miguel county, for governor
of Now Mexico, the Democratic par
ty announced to1 the world that
within it ranks every citizen of the
state ia regarded only as an Ameri
can, and that every man is judged
solely n hi merits and honored in
ooordaace with them. At the same
time,, in its recognition of the stead-
. Uy conaiátaney m Demoracy and the
abUiiy f the man who has beend
lieutenant governor of the state for
more than four and a half years, it
h no red those of New Mexico's pop
ulation in whose veins run the blood
ef the Conquistadores of the pion
eers of 014 Spain who helped so
wonderofly In carvling out nation
out of tha wilderness. Esequilel C
de Baea ia every inch an Aemican

highest ambitions, and bis unques
tioned statesmanship was demon
strated notable In hdia handling of
Republican senate a bitterly an
tagonistic body through three sess

work winning him the admiration and
praise of all who witnseseETOAYP
praise of 11 who witnessed it No
ban lu the state is better fitted by
learning, character, ideals and exper
ience to take charge of state affairs
and administer them impartially,
justly, economically and effectively.
Ami behind Eaequiel C. de Baca
stands William C. McDonald, pres
ent governor of the state, and the
ablest and best executive In tha long
list of those who have presided ov
er the destines of New Mexico, who
graciously accepted nomination for a
subordinate position that he might
continue actively to serva the party,
and that the treat record he has so

Stale University.
Albuquerque, N. M., August 2!:
Three hundred and fifty students, the
largest opening attendance in the his
tory of the New Mexico State Uni
versity, and an audience of citizens
who packed Rodey Assembly hall to
its utmost capacity, gathered this af
ternoon for the formal opening of
the University for the lfflrt-1917 year.
The oecauinn wat given special ob
servance by AISuiiieriue people bo-
cause of the notable growth of thu
attendance at the state univer ity
which i now certiin to pas 100, and
be.-ause of the fact that for the lir.rt
time street car transportation to the
univem'ty is available. The feature
of the opening exercise was an ad
dress by Robert E. Putney, who in
spite of his definite refusal, continues
to be discussed as the most available
man for the democratic nomination
governor. It was an address which
revealed Mr. Putney in a new light.
Taking as his subject "The Spiritual
and Moral Part of Our Daily Lives"
he showed that behind the energy and
judgment which have made him a suc
cessful merchant, community build
er and state fair maker Mr. Putney
has given deep thought to the finer
and higher sides of living, if indeed
his attention to the moral and spirit
ual phases of living have not been the
principal contributors to his success.
The address was an Inspiring call to
the young people to whom he direct
ed his remarks to consider the value
of due regard for development In
early life of the spiritual and respect
for the development of moral fiber. It
was a business man's talk with it all,
giving attention to the practical val
ue of the spiritual in self control anil
proper guidance of body and mind in
the work of every day living.
"If I did not believe that my talk to
you today would bear good fruit I
would not be here." Jbe said, "for I am
not seeking publicity at the present
time. It is likely that a great many
of you may think that this body of
ours is made of nothing more than
blood, bone and meat and that it is
maneuvered by something up in our
heads called the brain, all of which U
correct as far as it goes. But let me
tell you something my friends, you
have not started to live, nor will you
L. - .. -i. 1 1 - ! 1 .
be much more than mere animals un
til you have discovered that back of
that brain lies an industructibla some
thing which when thoroughly discov
ered and used never fails you and
will accomplish for you your very
highest ambitions. You are all entit
led to a living and any fool ran make
money; but what about that ambi
tion that inclination and desire to
rise and to be something more than
a mere ordinary working mule? Dis
cover your soul: discover the spirit
ual part of yo;u that force which
drives this machine of ours and which
allows you to do as you will with the
body, giving you perfect control, giv
ing you power to accomplish ths im
possible and raising you to the very
highest pinnacle of happimws and ef
ficiency." The speaker paid a high tributo to
the constructive work of President
Boyd, in the University of New Mex
ico and urged upon New Mexico peo
ple cordial support for the home state
institution aa a college thoroughly
prepared to give to the young people
of New Mexico the best there is In
practical, useful education and
training along all lines.
A now county Agriculturist arrived
on the scene Monday .August 31st
and will bear the name of John Wil
liam Knorr, jr. He weighed nine
pound. Mr. Knorr has gotten him
a fine Met! car in tha honor of the

are extended to Mr. and Mrs. Krorr
and ail their friends are anxious that
he will be as intelligent, as pleasant
snd as useful as the older Knorr.
