GRAND JURY FOR EXTORTION
| BUSINESS MEN BACK
! SENATOR POINDEXTER
IN STRONG STATEMENT
j>THEY ASK VOTERS TO
RENOMINATE HIM
Headed by J. E. Chilberg of the Scandinavian-
American bank, former president of the Chamber of
Commerce, *3 men, representing the business, profes
sional and labor element of the city, today joined in a
remarkable public statement urpin? Seattle and the state|
to rally behind I'nited States Sen. Miles Poindexter.
Never before in the history of political events <>t
this city or state has such a unanimity been manifested
among the various elements as toward the candidac\
of Poindexter.
Most of the signers in this list were opposed to
Poindexter when he ran six years asjo against Judjje
Burke.
Among the signers are two former mayors and
four of the present councilmen. Members and officers
both the Commercial Club and the Chamber of Com
merce are in the list.
The appeal for Poindexter support is based upon
and special grounds.
The general reasons are that Sen. Poindexter "has
been and is a senator for all the people and for every
«t of the state" and has "faithfully, at all times, rep
ented the best sentiments and highest ideals of hi.>
constituents."
The specific reasons for supporting Poindexter are:
"He labored earnestly and voted for a protective
tariff on lumber and shingles."
"To his efforts and influence are due the passage
of the Puget Sound navy yard bill."
"To him more than to any other representative
in either house of congress is due the credit for the
enactment of the Alaska Railroad bill."
The signers of the public state
meot are:

CANDIDATE FOR
SHERIFF HELD
ON 11 COUNTS
John \V. {Roberts, private detective and candidate
for sheriff. was indicted Friday by the federal grand
jury on charges of impersonating a government officer
and extortion.
Roberts gave himself up at the U. S. Marshal's
office at 1:35 p. m.. after having waited an hour at his
office for an officer to come and arrest him.
Roberts is alleged to have conspired with L F.
Coyne, now under arrest in El Paso for white slavery,
to extort S2,o(m) from Clifford Yarborough, a Ten
nesseean, under threat of exposing him to the federal
authorities here last March.
Yarborough and his illegitimate mulatto daugh
ter, Eugenia Mary Yarborough, 16, according to evi
dence United States District Attorney Allen presented
to the jury, were held by Roberts and Coyne under
guard in the Perry hotel for two days, while they
threatened to cause his arrest and imprisonment for
white slavery in connection with his bringing the
daughter here from Tennessee.

ton National bank.
He and Coyne, thru the Roberts
Detective agency, learned that Yar

girl here. and. making the Ten
nessean's acquaintance, suggested
that he could be charged with vio

to the evidence given the grand

evidence against him and throw
him in Jail

Coyne is said to have represent
ed that Roberts was in a position
to handle the rase as a govern
ment officer.
On March 11. last, it Is said,
Coyne and Roberts took Yarbor
ough to the Perry hotel, since re
modeled into a hospital but then
considered an exclusive hostelry,
where Coyne kept guard over them
Saturday night and Sunday.
The day following, they took Yar
borough to the Dexter llorti>n
bank, it Is said, where he drew
qut his account of 7.500. At the
Northern Hank £- Trust Co.. Yar
borough «ent $.100 to Kvansvllte.
Ind., for his daughter, who. it had
been arranged, was to be sent
away that night that the "evi

might be scattered.
Both Left the City"
Returning to the Perry, the al
leged $2,000 transaction is said to
have taken place, the money being
handed over by Yarborough to
Coyne. Roberts being in an ad
joining room.
That night Roberts and Coyne
went to the train when the girl
was started for Indtann The same
night Coyne accompanied Yarbor

address of welcome to which
Mr, Fred Nelson, master of the
King County Pomona Orange,
replied most gracefully, and the
high school orchestra played

Yarborough say» he has sever
seen Coyne, the check or hi* trunk

Eugenia Yarborough communi
cated her troubles to a member of
the crew of the train that waa car

Arriving in that city, the girl
was taken In rharge by a pollc*
matron, to whom she is said t«
have told the whole atory, the re
sult of which was the starting of
an investigation by the federal de

Tracing Coyne to El Paso, ther
arrested him In that city on a
charge of white slavery, it is said.
