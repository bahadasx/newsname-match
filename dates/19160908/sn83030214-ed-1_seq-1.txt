No Stnkcbreakers Used and Only Exiras

I. R. T., Claiming Victory.
After twenty-four houra of the atrike brought about by the
two-year contracta offered by the Interborough Rapid Tranait
Company to ita employea traina on the elevated and aubway linea
of New York are running without a hitch.
The brunt of the trouble fell upon the New York Railwaye
Company, which operatea the green aurface cara, whoae aervice
waa aerioualy impeded but not halted during the day. The com?
pany withdrew ita cara at night.
Motormen and conductora of the Third and Second Avenue
ayatema, mceting laat night, voted againat joining the atrike at
thia time. Three hundred employea of the Union Railwaya Com?
pany, in The Bronx, declared by ballot their readineaa to etrilte
in aympathy, but admitted that the company had kept ita agree?
ment.
Travia H. Whitney, of the Publie Service Commiaaion, who ac
companied atrike leadera to the meeting of the Third Avenue em?

of repreaentationa made by Mr. Whitney, the leadera agreed to
wait until the Publie Service Commiaaion had had time to inveati
gate the trouble before calling out the "red car" men.
FEVV MOTORMEN AMONG STRIKERS.
Not a motorman on the subway system and only a handful
tf thoso on the elevated lines are among the strikers. There are
few conduetors or switchmen. While the union elaims 3.500 strik?
ers among Interborough employes. Theodore P. Shonts will ad
mit to only 1.150. The great ma.jority are guards and gatemen.
most of them recently employed, who have not yet won the
privileges accorded to the older men. Many of th*1 strikors
are extras who have not been with the company long onmigh
to have regular runs.

HEDLEY DENIES
FORCING STRIKE
Interborough-Surface Of
ficer Witness Before
Commission.
Ba 'ar as wa? revealed in the Public
Ponriee I ommi^sion'" investigation yea
terilnv the traction strike which threat
cns to "paralvT* al! traffic between Von
Siers and Coney Island" arises ouf of a
most delicate technicalitv.
Part of that technic,,iitv liea in the
fact 'hat Frank Hedley, vice-president
ur.d general manager of the Interbor?
ough Kapid Transit Companv, is qaite
another person than the Frank Hedley
who is viee-preMder.t and general man?
ager of the New York Kailways I om
panv. For *he rcst. neither of the
Krar.k Hodleyl is a member of the
directorat" of either companv and
neither both heing absorbed in the
tunne<s of keeping trains and cars on
the move knows what the dir?ctors
are doing.
The dunl Hedley persopalities. re
solved into the ?ame per?'in, shared

mission'* afternoon session. In the
morning Theodore P. Shonts, pres
ident of the Interborough and New
York Railwajs. had testihed that the
d.rectors of the lattT companv had de
cided before the crisis that distribu

Fight Ovat Surfare l.lne?
(Jreater number* of the surfare
car employes were out, and the
strikers found it easier to hampcr
the operation of those linea. Union
b-adcrs have dexrided to roncentrata
their efrorts at the bejrinninir of the
strujfiijle on the surfare lines, and so
far it is the New York Railway*
Company that has to suffer. Wul
iam H. Ki'/.jrerald, union orfjanuer,
held hack last night the more lm
petuous employes of the Third Ave?
nue hr.e who demanded the callin,: af
a >ympathetie strike. It was no;
time yet, he said.
Karlier in the day the labor leader
had declared that there would he no
strike on the red car lines "so lor.a;
as the company keeps faith." Th'
"broken faith" of the arreen 'ar
company consists in the issuance of
Cootneta Mmiiar to those issued to
employes of the Interborough.
( umpani Clings to Contract*.
Whatever the strikers may hope to
arcomphsh ia other directions, it is the
two-year contract that is given as the
cause of the itrike eall, and the re
luctance to admit of any other griev
ance i* shown by Fitzgerald'* refuial
to call out employe* of c- mpanie,
which had not aought signature* ta
