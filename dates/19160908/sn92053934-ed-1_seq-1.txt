to the National American Woman
Suffrage association in convention
here, who say they expect to be en
franchised before many years have
passed, are taking time by the forelock
and are learning how to vote.

delegates are following much the same
plan of states where there are state
wide primary laws. The women are
using voting machines. With the ex
ception of three officers who have an
nounced they will retire, all the pres
ent officers expect to be reelected. So
far as can be learned, Mrs. Catt has
no opposition for president. It Is said
Mrs. Walter McXab Miller of Columbia,
Mo., will be elected first vice pres
ident to succeed Mrs. Frank M. Roes
sing of Pittsburgh, Pa
Mrs. Thomas Jefferson Smith of
Kentucky, Is Baid to he the probable
successor of Mrs. Miller as first aud
itor. One of the principal matters before
the convention today was the resolu
tion declaring that the passage of the
federal amendment through congress
in the paramount object of the associa
tion. Plans have been completed for re
ceiving President Wilson tonight. A
guard of honor made up of one dele
gate from each state will be lined up
to greet him when he reaches the
board walk theater, where he will de
liver an address.

overwhelming vote a resolution that
the association in the present national

dates for national offices who pledge
their support to the passage of the
Susan B. Anthony amendment for a
federal constitutional amendment. The
resolution was offered by Mrs. Ray
mond Robins of Chicago and a number
of other delegates.
HUGHES MAY FIRE
CAMPAIGN PILOT
"Get Bosy or Get Out" is Ultimatum
Republican Candidate Is Said
to Have Delivered.
Washington, Sept. 8. Spurred to
exasperation by the series of "frosts"
on his disappointing campaign tour,
Charles E. Hughes summoned William
R. Wilcox, chairman of the republi
can national committee and told him
In effect "to get busy or get out."
Immediately those close to Hughes,
who have view his increasing chagrin
at his reception by the west, predicted
that inside of two weeks Wilcox would
resign and in his stead Frank H.
Hitchcock would step in to try to "pep
per" the campaign.
Wilcox arrived and immediately went
into conference with Hughes. Wilccx
denied that he would be frozen out.
Hughes would not discuss his reported
dissatisfaction with his manager. Mem
bers of the party that has followed
Hughes from the Atlantic to the Pa
cific and halt way back, declared that
it was generally felt in the party that
Hughes is impatient at the way the
campaign has been conducted, and
called Wilcox hurriedly to meet him
and "get down to brass tacks."
It is an open secret that the Hughes
trip has been a "frost." Members of
the candidate's party admit that
"grievous mistakes" had been made,
and, privately, are inclined to blame
the national committee's direction of
the trip.
The embarrassment caused the can
didate in Washington by the "Perkins
Poindexter run." and the Johnson epi
sode in California is laid at the door
of Chairman Wilcox, according to
members of the candidate's party.
At their conference Hughes is re
ported to have plainly told Wilcox
that he was disappointed at the ar
rangement for his western tour and
believed the difficulties in Washington
and California might have been avoid
ed if there had been more cooperation
from the national committee.
