WEEKLY,* $2.00 PER YEAR
B. M. HOLT NOMINATED
AT PRIMARY ELECTION
LIEUT. GOVERNOR
A comparatively light vote was cast
at the primary election Tuesday in all
parts of the state. The towns cast a
fairly good vote. The country pre
cincts cast a very small vote, in some
instances running as low as 2 per
cent of the normal vote of the pre
cinct.
The election resulted in the Repub
licans nominating D. W. Davis for
governor; B. M. Holt for lieutenant
governor; Addison T. Smith and Bur
ton L. French for members of con
gress; George R. Barker for secre
tary of state; John W. Eagleson for
state treasurer; George W. Lewis for
state auditor; Ethel E. Redfield for
superintendent of schools; Marlin L.
Sweeley for attorney general; Roben
N. Bell for inspector of mines.
County Ticket.
The county ticket placed in nomi
nation by the Republicans of Canyon
county follows: • M. N. Baker for stete
senator; Arthur G. Street, E. C.
Bradley, J. W. Hamer, J. F.. Kerrick
and F. H. McConnell for representa
tives in the legislature: A. P. Alex
ainderson, Sylvester Hill and Grant

cock for assessor: J. E. Sturgeon for
coroner: Guy C. McGee for surveyor;
Alfred F. Stone for prosecuting at
torney.
Good Vote in Towns.
The vote in the principle towns of
the county was heavy. There was a
lively fight an sheriff, state senator
and county commissioner in the first
district. It was expected that the race
between John J. Plowhead and Alfred
E. Stone for prosecuting attorney
would be closer than it was.
The fight in Canyon county was
Caldwell against Payette and Nampa.
This fight started over the lieutenant
governorship and extended all down
the line. The efforts put for by Pay
ette and Nampa in behalf of Mr. Patch
gave Patch the county by 176 votes.
Mr. Holt without making a campaign
and with the opposition of Payette
and Nampa came within 176 votes of
carrying the county. Mr. Holt made
a magnificent race under great dif
ficulties. His nomination is assured
from the returns already i,n.
CANYON COUNTY RETURNS

Davies Carries County for Governor—
French and Smith for Congress.
The complete returns from Canyon
county were not all in yesterday.

governor; Barker for secretary* of
state; Eagleson for treasurer; Red
field for superintendent of schools;

MISS HELEN CASE AND
MR. WHITTEMAN MARRIED
Wedding Performed at Presbyterian
Church Sunday.
One of the most beautiful weddings
ever witnessed in Caldwell was that of
Miss Helen Case and Mr. Harlow
Whitteman a t the First Presbyterian
church Sunday morning. At the close
of the morning worship the congrega
tion was asked to be seated and im
mediately strains of the bridal chorus
from the Rose Maiden were heard
from the choir room. After first
phrase the singers appeared, charming
all with their splendid renditory or
tliis appropriate selection. The quar
tet was composed of Mrs. F. F. Beals,
Mrs. P. L. Case, Mr. A. A. Binford and
Mr. A. Westropc. Mrs. W. M. Case
and Mrs. P. L. Case then sang a duet
entitled "When We're Together,"
which was followed by a solo "Be
cause," by Mrs. W. M. Case.
During the musical program, the
Camp Fire Girls, of whom Miss Case
was guardian, festooned all the aisles
with asparagus rope and stood in place
during the whole service.
The familiar strains of the Lohen
rin wedding march were then heard,
Miss Marjorie Beale presiding at the
piano. The wedding party then ap
peared. being led up the two outer
aisles by Mr. Vance, minister of the
First Presbyterian church, and Mr.
Case, former minister and-brother of
the bride. Mr. Vance was followed
by little Betty Case who carried a pink
rose containing the bride's ring. Little
Hester Knepper of Boise, followed
Mr. Case bearing in her rose the ring
for the groom. Then appeared Mrs.
W. M. Cise as matron of honor, Mr.
L. Case taking the part of best
man. The bride on the arm .of her
father, Mr. Norman Case, then en
tered, the groom appearing in the
opposite aisle. The first part of the
wedding service from the Book of
Common Worship of the Presbyterian
church was then read by Mr. Vance,
the latter part of the ceremony with
its plighting vows being given by Mr.
Case. The service was rendered more
impressive by the bride and groom
kneeling for the wedding vows. The
Persian prayer rug used was kindly
furnished from the collection of Mr.
Vance.
After the pronouncing of the
Aaronic benediction the wedding
party marched down the center aisle to
the joyous strains of Mendlessohns
wedding march, Mr. Case being joined
by the mother of the bride. The en
tire wedding party was then whisked
awav to the home of the bride where
a delightful three course luncheon
came in the cutting of the bride's cake,
the following finding the lucky pieces:
Little Hester Knepper the ring,
Onendolyn Grete the dime, Buen
Beale the thimble, and Ruth Bradly
the darning needle.
Masses of cream and pink roses
against the background of asparagus
and ferns formed the artistic decora
tion of the church. Mrs. Vance and
Mrs Hardkoff having this in charge.
The home of the bride was made
beautiful dahlias and scarlet bitter
root berries, the gift of Mrs. W. E.
I.ewis of Sea Side, Oregon, and roses
from Mrs. E. B. Robertson of Nampa.
The bride was unusually beautiful in
an importad gown of Philippine em
broidery, lace and satin, with a long
tulle veil. She carried a shower bou
quet of bride's roses and sweet peas.
The matron of honor, Mrs. W. M.
Case, was gowned in cream lace and
carried Killarney roses. Mrs. Norman
Case wore a lavender charmuse
gown with hat to match.
Little Betty Case and Hester Knep
per, the ring bearers, were daintily
dressed in white embroidery, and
looked very much like white butter
flies as they futted down the aisle.
Miss Case is well known in Cald
well because of her connection with
the College of Idaho, having been the
teacher of Domestic Art' for three
years. She has also taken a very ac
tive part in all church work and be
came pianist the first Sunday after
her arrival in Caldwell. She was first
guardian for the Camp Fire Girls of
the church and will be greatly missed
by these girls.

SOUTHERN VISITOR
SEES THE VALLEY
A. E. Gipson of Cnldwell Talks About
Conditions—Incidental Refere
ence to Politics.
(Lewiston Tribune.)
A. E. Gipson of Caldwell, in the
southern part of the state, was in the
city yesterday on his way home from
a business trip to Spokane. While
here he was a guest at the home of
Dr. and Mrs. W. C. Stalker, Mrs.
Stalker being his daughter. During
the day Mr. Gipson met a number of
frie.nds and also in company with Wm.
Bollinger drove around the city and
through Lewiston orchards.
He was much interested in and
pleased with what he saw. Mr. Gipson
says every locality has its local prob
lems and that Lewiston is no ex
ception to the rule. It will take time
to work out some of these and sta
bilize them; particularly things per
taining to the fruit industry, but Lew
iston has certain manifest advantages
>f soil, climate and location that can
scarcely fail to redound to her advant
age and permanent prosperity.
Mr. Gipson is a pioneer in agricul
tural journalism in Idaho, has spent
more than 20 years in that line of
work as founder and editor of the
Gem State Rural and Livestock Jour.
nal, and has had exceptional oppor
tunities for the study of the resources
of the state. His forecast of the future
of the Lewiston country should be
looked on as coming from one quali
fied to speak regarding it.
lie was especially pleased with the
campaign for good roads here and
has no hesitancy in saying that the
movement will result in great benefit
to the city and all the tributary coun
try. It will likewise prove an im
portant link in the state and nation
wide system of good roads.
Mr. Gipson had a good word for
the state normal school located in
this city. He feels thlat lie is in a
position to know, at least to a consid
erable extent, the work the school
is doing, and hence is glad to com
In speaking of the recent consolida
ti n of the Gem State Rural and the
Id:".ho Farmer, Mr. Gipson said that
while in Spokane lie was in conference
with those who are to direct the fu
ture of the consolidated paper, both in
a business and editorial way, and that
plans are being matured to broaden
the work and make the publication a
state agricultural paper in every sense
of the term. The name of the new or
consolidated paper will he the Gem
State Rural and Idaho Farmer. Mr.
Gipson will continue as editor and the
editorial department will remain at
Caldwell. The printing and circula
tion end of the business will be handl

of Spokane, owners and publishers of
the Oregon Farmer and the Washing
_ ...
Northwest Agricultural Trio." In this
ton Farmer. In other words, while
the Gem State Rural and Idaho Farm
er will be a distinct publication, it
will nevertheless be one of the links of
the trio to be known as "The Pacific
way there will be close and strong co
operation for the advancement of ag
riculture in the entire Pacific north
west and to that end the aim will
be to make each and all of these pub
lications of real service to the farmer
and to the farm homes of this region.
When asked about the political situ
ati ji in south Idaho, Mr. Gipson said
he hardly felt qualified to speak with
anything like assurance. However,
he said the interest was becoming
more and more pronounced as the
date for nominations drew near and
he looked for a pretty full vote. One
of the elements of uncertainty is the
vote of the former members of the
progressive party. This would be di
vided, with probably a major part go
ing to the Republicans. Still, the
Democrats would get quite a vote and
the Prohibitionists more or less.
He said the Prohibition party, as
he understood it, might not nominate
state or county tickets but would
likely have a congressional ticket in
addition to its presidential nominees
and presidential electors.
Particular interest seemed to center
on the offices of governor, state treas
urer, secretary of state and congress
men. With reference to the first
ifanied office, while Governor Alexan
der will have a strong following it
seems to be understood that lie has a
big contract on his hands.
Mr. Crum, the candidate from Lew
iston, stands well and seems assured
of considerable strength, Mr. Gipson
said. "As a matter of fact, the inter
est in the election is generally very
pronounced and there is little danger
of its going by default."
With reference to the crops and
prices in south Idaho, Mr. Gipson said
they were exceptionally good as a
rule outside of the fruit, which would
be light. Potatoes, wheat, alfalfa and
farm seeds were in strong demand
and good prices were being realized.
Livestock was also becoming an im
portant factor. Caldwell has become
one of the great horse markets of the
country and farmers and stockmen
are realizing handsome profits. A
fine early potato market is also being
developed and the country tributary
to Caldwell is becoming famous for
the yield and quality of its potatoes,
as well as for the extent and quality
of its dairy products. The future,
therefore, of south Idaho farmers is
one of hope and confidence.

AN
EELWORM DISEASE
IN TRE PACIFIC
I
I
Washington, D. C., Sept. 6.—The
occurrence and spread of the bulb and
te m infesting nematode or eclworm
(Tyletnchus dipsaci), which has been
•eceutly found producing a serious
liscase of clover in the slate of Ore
goiiii should receive general attention,
•specially in the northwest. Since it
was discovered in hyacinth bulbs at
Bellingham in 1913, it has been ob
served each successive year causing
lainage to strawberries, onions, or
L-lover in oilier localities of the Pa
cific northwest.
Although the nematode has been
uithentically reported in this coumttry
only on hyacinths, onions, narcissus,
clover, strawberries, and rye yet it is
;nown to attack in Europe many dif
ferent species of plants. Some of the
more important crop plants attacked,
»a addition to those mentioned are:
Barley, oats, wheat, alfalfa, turnip,
kidney bean, broad bean, potato, flax,
pea, and lupine. It causes the greatest
lamage perlJaps to the hyacinth and
other bulbous crops of Holland. It is
particularly destructive to certain
niants in Australia and has destroyed
extensive acreas of alfalfa in south
ern Africa.
Many weeds ain<l plants of less
•couoniic importance have also been
lound io lie attacked in foreign coun.
r i« s. Some of these are: Forget-me
not p!il >x plantain, spear grass, bind
weed, primrose, buttercup, soy this
tle. penny cress, garlir, daisy, and
teasel.
Unfortunately, it has been recently
introduced into the United States anil
appears well established in some lo
calises of the Pacific northwest where
conditions seem favorable for its re
>r vluchon anil spread. Every effort
should be made not only to prevent Its
urther introduction into this country
'int also to stop its spreading from
those localities already infected.
Effect on Hosts.
On the ah 've-ground parts °f
plants the nematode in general pro
I'-res characteristic distortions and
usually yellow to brown longitudinal
discolor..lions which clearly indicate
the presence of the parasite. How.
vit , somewhat different effects are
induced on different groups otf its
hosts. In hyachinths, onions and other
Oulbous crops, affected leaves are not
noticeably distorted or swollen, but
become decidedly yellow in longi
tudinal streaks, finally wilt, and die.
In more woody plants such as rye,
c?j:s , clover and alfalfa, diseased
leaves and stems are distorted, thick
ened, ;vi(I yellow and the whole plant
• Kcomes dwarfed. When infested
plants are not killed by the parasite
they seldom reach maturity and us
ually fail to produce fruit.
Although primarily a pest of the
aerial porti ins of plants, the nematode
occurs in tubers and bulbs and has
been reported on one plant, the hop,
as the cause of a root disease. In
onions and hyachinths the nematode
migrates at the end of the growing
season from the leaves to the bulb so
that entire scales became invaded and
discolored. Such bulbs, if cut in cross
sections, present one or more charac
teristic rings, thus giving rise to the
common name of "the ring disease"
when the malady occurs in hyacinths.
Description.
If a small piece of leaf or other in
fested tissue be carefully tonn to
pieces by means of pins öl- needles
in a dish containing a few drops of
clean water, many of the white,
thread-like, adult celworms about one
; fiftieth of an inch luaig can be seen
j with the naked eye actively moving
ah ul in the liquid.
j Life Cycle of Organism.
Each female may produce a large
I number of eggs, which, if conditions
be favorable, hatch directly into worm
shaped larvae. The latter reach ma
turity in about four weeks, so that
several generations can be produced
during a growing season. Larvae, or
any of the subsequent developmental
stages of the nematode, are capable
under suitable conditions of penetrat
ing and moving within certain tissues
of its host plants and thereby pro
ducing the various effects already de
scribed.
Means of Distribution.
I he pest can be transported ii
many ways. It was probably intro
duced into the United States in Im
ported bulbs, tubers, or plants, or
along with shipments of other mater
ial which may harbor the parasite.
Seed are even strongly suspected of
being the means whereby the parasite
is most commonly distributed. It can
be carried from field to field by irri
gation or surface water, in soil which
clings to the feet of -man or other
animals, to implements, and the roots
of plants, and in garbage, manure, or
waste matter of any kind containing
parts of diseased tissue.
