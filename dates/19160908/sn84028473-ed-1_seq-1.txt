SEVENTY YEAR OLD MAN
GETS ENTIRE NEW FACE
For 47 Years Unable to Close Eyes
Sight Nc Ruined by
Alaskan Lights
Port Angeles Wash John Watson
70 years old who has traveled all ov
er tho world and who for forty seven
ears could not close hib eib because
he was without eyelids has had his
face lomodeled Tho new face which
is his third one includes a perfect
set of eyelids and changes his appear
ance to such nn extent that his old
lrlends heie did not recognize him
when ho landed for a visit this week
Watson has been around the world
twice and has tiled tho Ilfo of a pion
eer In the wildest parts of tho North
American continent Most of his ad
ventures took place during tho forty
bevon jenrs between tho disfiguration
of his face by an accident and tho
coming Into tho possession ota for
tune ho inherited somo time ago
During this time he was known as
the man who couldnt close his eyes
At the age of 20 years at his homo
in Indianoln Iowa the explosion of a
can of asphaltum varnish tore nwayi
much of the flesh of his faco and dcs J
troyed his eyelids altho his sight was
not injured With a badly disfigur
ed faco he started out in the world
and blazed trails thru Montana tho
Northwest and Alaska
Sleep was almost impossible for
him At first my sleep was limited
to brief fretful periods ho paid but
as time went on I would drop into
blumber staring straight nhead In the
darkness I could seo things in the
dark probably more clearly than any
one else could v
In th6 far north the summers with
practically no darkness almost ruin
ed his vision nnd ho returned to Seat
tle Ho was without means and for
years drifted around tho country
Somo time ago a rich relative left him
a fortune Watson went to a Phila
delphia surgeon who removed pieces
of skin fronv various parts of his body
nnd grafted them upon his face re
storing it to a nearly normal appear
ance At the sarao time tho surgeon
from other pieces of skin skillfully
fashioned him a new set of eyelids
the artificiality of which can hardly
be detected
