Joslin-Wegner
A very pretty wedding was held
at the home of Mr. and Mrs. W. C.
Joslin, Monday September 4, when
their daughter, Miss Leona was
married to Mr. Adolph Wegner of
Moscow. The ceremony was per
formed by Rev. Matney of Kend
rick at 10:30 o'clock.
Places were laid for thirty-three
guests at an elaborate dinner which
was served at noon.
They were accompanied to the
train at 1:30 by a host of friends,
amid the usual shower of rice and
old shoes. After a short wedding
trip to Spokane they will return to
Moscow where they will make their
home.
Mrs. Wegner was one of Julia
etta's most popular young ladies
and has many friends there as well
as in Kendrick. Mr. Wegner spent
a number of years in Kendrick and
is well liked by everyone. He has
a good position with the Owl Drug
Co. at Moscow.
Aside from the family the follow
ing guests were present at the wed
ding: Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Rogers,
Uniontown; Mr. and Mrs. A. F.
Wegner, Cameron; Rev. Matney,
Kendrick; Mr. and Mrs. Miles
Pierce and family, Mr. and Mrs. S.
T. Dunlap, Mrs. A. M. Pierce, Mrs.
J. Evans, Spokane; Mrs. A. Mor
gan and daughter, Misses Hazel
Overlander, Amy Carlson, Hazel
Irwin, Mr. Bob Jones, Glen Gil
mour, Arthur Wegner, and Herman

Peterman- Bechtol
Miss Ethel Peterman of Palouse
and Jack Bechtol of Kendrick were
married at Asotin Saturday, Sep
tember 2. They returned to Kend
rick Sunday where they will make
their home.
Mr. Bechtol met his bride nearly
a year ago when she was visiting
on Potlatch ridge and their friend
ship resulted in their marriage last
week.
Mr. Bechtol will continue as a
cabinet maker in the employ of the
Kendrick Furniture Co. He has
rented the upstairs of the Tom Mc
Dowall house and will move in this
week.
Smut Problem Grows
In Lewis county, Mr. Wade finds
the smut problem of growing im
portance. He says: "In my rounds,
I find an unusual amount of stink
ing smut in the winter wheat.
Closer examination shows that from
ten to fift een per cent of the wbeat j
} * s affected. These findings led me j
j to examine some which I knew
were sown last year before the har
j vest and in every case that these
were practically free from smut,
while adjoining fields, which had
been summer fallowed and sown in
the usual manner with the same
see d and with the same treatment
| for smut, showed from ten to twen
ty-five per cent of smutted heads."
Building Cement Walks
F. A. Wallace has contracted
with several business houses and
with a number of residence owners
to build concrete sidewalks. He is
now putting in a walk along the
i.uvv
side and front of the Kendrick State
Bank building. He is figuring on
a contract to put in a walk the
length of the block in front of the
park. The building of this walk
would be a great improvement to
the town and would be a good ex
ample for the city to set for the
property owners. There are a num
{ ber of walks in town that are posi
tively dangerous and anything but
a credit to Kendrick.
Save Your Exhibits
The fair committee wishes to impress upon those
who expect to exhibit farm products at the fair this
fall, that there is a prize of $25.00 first and $15.00
second to be given for the best general display of
farm products.
Save all of your garden, larm and orchard pro
duets that will do to put on exhibition at the fair.
There will be plenty of room in the pavilion for
everything you have, so bring it in, even if you do
not think that it will win a prize—it will help the fair
display. There is a long list of premiums to be
given away and you can win some of them.
This is a fair for the Potlatch country and you
can do nothing better to help make the fair a success
than to become an exhibitor. For any information
in regard to the preparation of the exhibits, inquire
of Joday Long, chairman of the fair committee.
Edison Favors Wilson
Saratoga, N. Y., Sept. 6 .—Thom-'
as A. Edison, the electricity wizard,
republican and supporter of Theo
dore Roosevelt for the presidential
nomination, announces that he will
work and vote for Woodrow Wilson.
He said :
"Not since 1860 has any cam
paign made such a direct call on
simon-pure Americanism. The
times aré too serious to talk or
think in terms of republicanism or
democracy. Real Americans must
drop parties and get down to fun
damental principles.
"More than any other president
in my memory, Woodrow Wilson
has been faced by a succession of
tremendous problems any one of
which decided the wrong way
would have had disastrous conse
quences. Wilson's decisions so far
have not got us into any serious
trouble, nor are they likely to.
"He has given us peace with
honor. Hughes' talk about the
United States being despised is non
sense. Neutrality is a mighty try
ing policy, but back of it are inter
national law, the rights of human
ity and the future of civilization.
"With reference to Mexico, I
think the president has acted wise
ly, justly and courageously.''

Some New Spelling
"Ugh'' has caused the waste of
gallons of ink and millions of min
utes of time by its needless pres
ence in such words as though and
through; to say nothing of the
stupid and burdensome task of
learning to spell a simple word in
so foolish a fashion. This is only
oneo f 4b e many useless and burden
S ome spellings, each a trifle in it
ge ]^ b ut rea jiy a heavy burden on
fied f ormSi and tbe Board required
the pub i is h ers of the spelling book
to include the Idaho list of simpli
childhood.
Idaho is getting rid of the com
monest and most useless of these
extra letters. Some months ago
the State Board of Education au
thorized the use of certain simpli
fied spe uj n g S as follows:
I. Use the following spellings for
these words and their compounds
and derivatives: tho, altho, thoro,
thru, rime, draft, and sulfur.
II. In all words where there is a
choice between
1. The dipthong ae and the vowel
e, use e: esthetic, medieval, etc.
Final ette and et use et: quar-'

Indians Are Citizens

many of them voted dry.
---
Lewiston. Idaho, Sept. 4.—Dr.
Jacob Breid, superintendent of the
Lapwai Indian school and acting
Indian agent there, has given out a
letter received from the depart
ment signed by E. B. Merritt, as
sistant commissioner, declaring that
the Nez Perce Indians, under the
allotments of land in severalty un
der act of February 8 , 1887, are
citizens of the United States and
entitled to all the privileges of an
elector, and that "the Indians should
be advised by you of their right
and urged to fight all efforts made
to disfranchise them."
The question of the citizenship
of the Indians was raised at the
last local option election when
Survey of Highway
Within a few days, State High
way Engineer Booth will place a
crew of engineers in the field to
make the survey of the highway
from Whitebird to the Lewis coun
ty line as a link in the north and
south highway. C. C. VanArsdol,
who is engaged in handling the
. .
Lewiston Hill state highway work,
I will be consulting engineer on the
work out of Whitebird, and it is
! expected that the survey can be
j completed within sixty days. With
this work completed, Engineer
Booth explains the state highway
department will be in possession of
quite complete data as to the total
cost of the north and south road
from Weiser to the Lewis county
line.—Tribune.
Latah Primary Election
a
Moscow, Sept. 6 .—In the primary
election in Latah county yesterday
the returns from 22 precincts com
plete, out of a total of 28 precincts,
leaves little doubt as to the out
come when tne final vote is counted,
In the gubernatorial contest the
vote shows D. W. Davis leading and
George E. Crum second. Taylor
and Captain Davis are running
about even. For supreme court
Dunn and Rice lead Justice Sul
*' van -
The legislative and county ticket
gives F. C. McGowan, Ole Bohman
and Alfred S. Anderson a strong
vote, while Columbus Clark is ap
parently defeated. In the contest
for commissioners Cone. Lyon and
Woody have apparently defeated
Travis, Vinnigerholz and Nelson.
For Sheriff Roberts has overwhelm
inglv defeated Kilde. L. G. Peter
son defeated his opponent, G. C. j
Hoyt, for probate judge while Gem
mil is leading Reeves for Assesor by
a slight margin. Oversmith is ap
parently nominated over Pickett..
The democratic vote was extreme
ly light throughout the county and
in many instances the democrats
failed to record a vote on supreme
court justice. On the state ticket
Frazier leads Parker in the county
and Dougherty leads Hansen. The
only other contest on the democrat
ic ticket was for commissioner in
the first district, Emory Olson of
Deary having evidently defeated
P. P. Nolan of Potlatch.

Postoffice Robbers Identified
_ •
Deputy Sheriff John Hall has
. . . , . 0 , , i
just returned from Spokane where
. ., ... ..
he went as a witness in the prelim -1
.
mary case and to identify an iron
, . . . j
contrivanoe, similar to one found
near the scene of the Marcus rob
bery, as one found near the Kend
rick postoffice the morning after it
was robbed. The instrument is one
used to pull combination knobs t'
from safes, and was made on Dona- !
van's special order at the Interna
tional Iron Works, according to the
testimony of workmen who were
witnesses in the preliminary and '
who identified Donavan and the
man taken with him, who gave the
name of John Hayes, as being the
ones who ordered the instrument.
Mrs. Weaver, who lives on Amer
ican Ridge, has identified Donavan
as one of the men who took break- j
fast at her house the morning the
Kendrick safe was robbed. This
and other evidence which the sher
iff's office claims it can produce
should Donavan be brought here
for trial, tends very conclusively
to connect the prisoner with the
crime, local officials state.
Should Donavan secure his free
dom from the charges of robbing
the Marcus postoffice, the postal in
spection department will bring him
to Moscow to stand trial for the
Kendrick robbery. Hayes, arrest
ed with Donavan, was released, no
evidence having been produced to
connect him with the robberies.
A search of Donavan's record in
the east proves that he has served
both in Iowa and Kansas peniten
tiaries for safe-blowing according
to Deputy Sheriff Hall, who went
over the matter with the postal au
thorities in Spokane. Pictures ob
tained from eastern penal institu
tions where Donavan was incarcer
ated, prove that he is the same man
who commited the eastern robber
ies, although he denies that he ever
served time for the charge of burg
lary before.—Star-Mirror.

A Probable Fact
^ you coldd afford to take the
t' me t° make an automobile tour
of Latah count y y° u would P rob *
ab 'y be impressed with the follow
facts: That the roads general
^ have been greatly improved dur
n S the P as ^ tew years. That the
bean and corn crop in the vicinity
°f Kendrick is the best in the coun
ty. Tha t the orchards are smaller
and n °t so we ^ kept as they were
bve or s * x y ea rs ago. That road
bo & s are still in evidence and speed
fi e nds becoming more numerous,
That there is more travel on the
countv
road than ever before
and a big per cent of the travel is
done in Ford cars. That the farm
improvements indicate a prosperous
condition throughout the county.
That the more you travel over the
county the better satisfied you are
with the Potlatch country. And
wb en you strike main street on
your wav home you declare it to be
the roughest piece of road in the
county.
Care (or Your Land
The acre yield of corn in Kansas
has decreased from 42 to 18 bush
els in the last 40 years, due largely
to improper management of the
soil. The same thing could prob
ably be said of the wheat yield of
this part of the country. If the
farmers do not seed their land to
clover or some similar .crop in rota
tion with their grain crops, it will
not be many years until the Pot
latch will cease to be one of the
greatest farming districts in the
west.
