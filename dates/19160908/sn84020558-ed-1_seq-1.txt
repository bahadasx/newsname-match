WASHINGTON, Sept. 7. Congress
will adjourn tomorrow morning at ten
o'clock. After nine months devoted to
legislation both houses held protracted
sessions tonight to end their affairs
by approving the conference agree
ment on the emergency revenue bill to
raise approximately $200,000,000, de
sired by the administration to meet the
extraordinary appropriations for na
tional defense and the Mexican emer
gency. Only the physical impossibility of
engrossing the revenue measure in
time for the president's approval be
fore tomorrow morning prevented
final adiournment tonight, despite the
waning protests of members of both j
houses who threatened, but did not ex
ecute the threats, to prolong the ses
sion by demands for action on meas
ures which were forced over until De
cember. Leaders of the senate and house
agreed upon a quiet resolution to ad
journ at ten o'clock in the morning and
scores of members left town on mid
night trains, eager to reach their homes
for participation in the national poli
tical campaign.
The final vote on the revenue bill
was delayed in the senate by vigorous
protests from Pacific coast senators
against the elimination of the Alaskan
fisheries amendment. It was after
midnight when a vote and adjourn
ment until tomorrow at last appeared
to be in sight.
The last appropriation measure, the
general deficiency bill, was adopted by
both houses while waiting for the con
ference report on the revenue bill and
the Danish treaty to provide for pur
chase of the Danish West Indies for
$25,000,000 was ratified. The corrupt
practices bill to limit campaign ex
penditures, and the immigration bills,
which President Wilson had an
nounced he would veto if passed, were
put aside and will be taken up in De
cember. The revenue bill as it will go to
President Wilson for approval tomor
row contains drastic provisions em
powering the president to retaliate
against foreign interference with
American commerce, creates a non
partisan tariff commission, increases
the duties on dyestuffs to encourage
their manufacture in the United States,
provides means to prevent dumping of
cheap foreign made goods Into Ameri
can markets after the war and pro
vides for income. Inheritance, muni
tions, corporation stock, liquor, and
miscellaneous internal revenue taxes.
During consideration of the report in
the senate. Senator Chamberlain of
Oregon protested vigorously against
elimination by the conference com
mittee oj a retaliatory provision
against Canadian control of Pacific
ooast fisheries, and Representative
Gardner of Massachusetts, enlisted the
house with bitter denunciation of the
retaliatory provision against foreign
interference with American commerce.
Mr. Gardner charged congress with
hypocrisy and his criticisms of the ad
ministration aroused the ire of some
of the democrats, two of whom Rep
resentative Decker of Missouri and
Cullop of Indiana made speech

and Decker, but that the questions
of national honor rose above par
tisanship. Representative Decker, amid rounds
of applause, thanked God that there
was in the White House a president
who was willing to resort to negotia
tions before resorting to the sword. He
suggested that the views of Mr. Gard
ner and of Mr. Roosevelt were pro
ally. "You claim to be devoted to human
ity and to despise commercialism," said
Mr. Gardner, "Why don't you pass an
amendment refusing American har
bors to Germany's interned ships un
til she repudiates the Lusitania crime?
These retaliatory amendments would
be looked 'upon all over the world as

Kansas City, and elsewhere with rep
resentatives of 25,000 shopmen who
are fcttking" higher pay and reduced
hours.
The shopmen are negotiating with
the roada simultaneously, but not col
lectively. The trades represented In

blacksmiths and their helpers.
The demands, according to railway
executives, are for an Increase' of five
cents an hour in wages and for an
elght-heur day. The increase and
time reduction, according to railway
officials, would total perhaps three
million dollars a year.
Where the open shop policy obtains,
Ihe railways are dealing with the
shopmen not as unions but as repre

These were regarded as "popularly ob

the conference report pn the revenue

announced the elimination of the stamp
taxes. Representative Stafford of
Wisconsin, republican, said it was a

E
republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON. Sept. 7. Authority
to take drastic retaliatory steps against
intereference with American commerce
by belligerents in the European war
are contained in the emergency reve
nue bill as finally adopted. It was
finally adopted as follows:
"Whenever any country, dependency
or colony shall prohibit the importa
tion of any article the product of the
soil or industry of the I'nited States
and not injurious to health or morals,
the president shall have power to pro
hibit, during the period that such pro
hibition is in force, the importation
into the United States of similar arti
cles, or in case the United States does
not import similar articles, from that
country, then other articles, the prod
ucts of such country, dependency or
colony.
"That whenever during the existence
of a war in which the I'nited States is
not engaged the president shall be sat
isfied that there is reasonable ground
to believe that under the laws, or
practice of nations, the importation
into the country, dependency or colony
of any article the product of the soil
or industry of the United States and
not injurious -to health or morals is
prevented or restricted, the president
Is authorized and empowered to pro
hibit or restrict during the period of
such prohibition or restriction is in
force, the importation into the United
States of similar or other articles,
products of such country, dependency
or colony as in his opinion the public
interest may require; and in such case
he shall make proclamation stating the
article or articles which are prohibited
from Importation into the United
States."
The final retaliation measure, based
on the same war conditions, would give
the president authority to withhold
clearances to vessels of a belligerent
nation.
"Making or giving any undue or un
reasonable preference or advantage in
any respect whatsoever to any partic
ular person, company, firm or corpora
tion, or any description of traffic in
the United States or to any citizens of
the United States residing in neutral
countries abroad, or in subjecting any
particular person, company, firm or
corporation or any particular descrip
tion of traffic in the United States or
Its possessions, or any citizens of the
United States residing In neutral coun
tries abroad to any undue or unreason
able prejudice, disadvantage, injury or
discrimination in regard to accepting,

Rers. or in any other respect what
Boever. he is hereby authorized am
empowered to direct the detention of
such vessels by withholding clearance
or by formal notice forbidding depart
ure, and to revoke, modify or renew any
sucn direction."
It also would give authority to the
president to deny American facilities
of commerce to citizens in the United
States of an offending belligerent na
tion, and would authorize him to use
the land and naval forces of the United
States to enforce the retaliatory pro
visions. ON NORMAL

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
ATLANTIC CITY, X. J., Sept. 7
After a long debate- which carried the
afternoon session of the convention
well into the evening the National
American Woman Suffrage Associa
tion today adopted a platform, out
lining its plan of campaign for se
curing the submission of the federal
suffrage amendment to the state leg
islatures for ratification.
It was decided that the next an
nual convention In 1917 be held in
March or "thereabouts"; that a lobby
be continued at Washington, and that
the association conduct a nation-wide'
campaign of education, agitation or
ganization and publicity in support of
the federal amendment. A million
dollar campaign fund is to be raised
between October this year and Octo
ber 1917.
It was further agreed by the con
vention that no state association shall
ask the legislature of its state for the
submission of an amendment or refer
endum to the. people until the na
tional board or executive council of
the association shall have been given
the opportunity to investigate condi
tions and give consent. Any state
organization which proceeds to such
state camniisn without consent must
be prepared to finance and conduct
its campaign without help from the
national body. Other steiw also are
to be taken to standardize and na
tionalize tho woman suffrage move
ment.
The convention got into a tangle

was pot worth the paper it was writ

of the convention yesterday when it
was decided that the asscciation
should woik for both federal and
statu suffrage legislation. Finally,
many of the delegates became weary
of the long session and when another

WASHINGTON, Sept. 7. Orders
were issued by the war department
today for the discahrge from federal
service as soon as practicable of
twelve National Guard regiments com
prising, about 15,000 men, recently
withdrawn to their home states from
the Mexican border, and a number of
smaller organizations of soma 1,500
college and university students.
Orders for the mustering out of ad
ditional units are expected to follow
soon. Tho next regiment to leave the
federal service will be the Fourteenth
New York Infantry, now at camp near
Fishkill, N. Y., which will go as soon
as its members are freed from danger
or para-typhoid contagion.
There are about 40,000 guardsmen
still in state mobilization camps and
these probably will be dispatched to
the border very soon to relieve men
now serving there. Secretary Baker
favors giving all the state troops a
chance for the training to be acquired
on the patrol line.
Today's orders were considered by
some officials as a preliminary to the
withdrawal of General Pershing b reg
ulars from Mexico. Officers of the
general staff insisted, however, that
the relenwA nf the frnnrdslen resulted
principally from the improving condi- I
tions on the border.
The original order for all guards
men in the federal service to move to
the border as soon as possible, al
though, held in abeyance by General
Funston's request received by the de
partment when the railroad strike was
imminent, has not been revoked. Sec
