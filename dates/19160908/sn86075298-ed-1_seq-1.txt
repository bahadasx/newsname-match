SECRET DEMANDS
MAY INVOLVE U.S.
Washington Fears Serious Comn
plications in Orient.
Tokio, Sept. 5.-Another clash be
tween Chinese and Japanese troops is
officially reported from Chaopangpa,
Mongolia, and has led to the dispatch
of heavy Japanese reinforcments. It
Is claimed the Chinese attacked the
Japanese while the Japanese were ad
vancing to mediate between the Chi
nese and Mongoliatis.
Washington, Sept. 5.-Secret de
mands in addition to those published
in dispatches from Peking are being
pressed on China by Japan as a re
sult of the recent clash of Chinese
and Japanese troops at Chengdhaitun.
It became known here that the sit
uation is much more serious than ha
been indicated, confidential reports
saying the unpublished demands
threaten the authority of China over
the whole of Inner Mongolia.
Officials here view the development
with real anxiety, fearing another
China-Japanese crisis, which might
involve the interests of the United
States.
The Chengchiatun incident, trivial
in itself, but coming on top of the
strained relations ever since the Japa
ncre took over Kioachow from Ger
many, has been closely watched since
Japan hastened to send 2,000 soldiers
to the disturbed district and her cabi
net announced that a satisfactory out
come depended on China.
Alarm in Peking.
Reports from Peking show alarm
there. The prompt and unanimous ac
ceptance of the new cabinet is believ
ed to have been a result of the serious
ness of the Japanese and financial
problems.
Japan's demands, as published, call
for dismissal of Chinese officers in
command of the troops at the scene
of the trouble, withdrawal of the Chi
nese garrison, indemnification of the
families of the Japanese killed and
extension of the Japanese police
rights to Innet Mongolia.
Except for the possibility of Amer
ican interference, it is pointed out,
Japan virtually has a free hand in
China, as all the European powers are
too fully occupied at home to devote
much attention to the Far East.
JAPANESE LOAN FOR CHINA
Mikado's Government to Lend Neigh
bor $30,000,000.
Washington, Sept. 5.-Japan's pro
pased $30,000,000 loan to China is ex
pected by the Japanese embassy here
to go through almost lhsmediately.
It is said China's financial needs are
most pressing and that further delay
may prove serious for the new gov
eminent.
Japanese financiers will, it is believ
ed. be entirely responsible for the
loan, though Great Britain, France and
Russia may be asked to participate
for diplomatic reasons.
The financial stringency which up
to now has handicapped Japanese in
the financial negotiations is thought
to have passed with the large profits
made on war munitions.

ALLEGED SPY FOUND
WITH U. S. WAR MAPS
New York, Sept. 5.-Disclosures that
may reveal a sensational international
plot to steal military secrets of the
United States are expected to follow
the recovery in Baltimore of eight
original maps prepared for the navy
department and alleged to have been
stolen from an officer of the coast
guard service.
The maps were recovered by the po
lice in a furnished room in Baltimore,
which they declared recently has been
occupied by Herbert Sauer, a deserter
from the coastguards, and now a pris
oner In the Tombs in connection with
the mysterious death of Mrs. Caroline
Tiarks on Aug. 25, in her apartment
at 515 West One Hundred and Thirty
fifth street.
Confronted with the stolen maps,
admitted by the federal authorities to
be of the utmost military importance
andd accused of being a German spy
Sauer refused to say how he came into
possession of them and much other
property the police declare was stolen
from Lieutenant George Clayton Alex
ander and Lieutenant Scally, both of
the coastguard service.
The maps were prepared by Lieuten
ant Scally, who recently returned from
Bering sea, and contained valuable in
formation about the waters in the vi
cinity of the Aleutian islands, which
form an extension o fthe Alaskan pen
insula.
WILSON WILL SPEAK
BEFORE SUFFRAGISTS
Atlantic City, N. J., Sept. 5.-Presi
dent Wilson will speak Friday night
at the convention of the National
Women Suffrage association here.
The coming of the president is ex
pected to have an important bearing
on the controversy over the future
policy of the association and the
question of "states' rights" as it con
cerns votes for women.
One faction, headed by Mrs. Car
rie Chapman Catt, national president,
favors leaving the question of suffrage
to the states.
The other faction, of which Miss
Alice Paul, president of the Congres
sional union, is a leader, wants the
association to center its efforts on a
federal amendment.

WELSH RETAINS HIS TITLE
Referee Roche Renders Unpopular
Decision.
Colorado Springs, Colo., Sept. 5.
Freddie Welsh retained his title of
champion lightweight pugilist of the
world, after going the full scheduld
twenty rounds with Challenger Char
ley White of Chicago. Referee Billy
Roche of New York awarded Welsh
the decision on points.
When Referee Roche announced his
decision in favor of Welsh the chsl
langer's adherents appeared for the
moment spellbound. Then began a
fusillade of. hundreds of cushions at
the referee. He was rushed by
friends to a waiting automobile.
Guarded by a policeman, the vehicle
was speded up an unfrequented road
to the hotel, while hundreds of men
and boys rushed after it until dis
tanced.

A. SUTHERLAND ELECTED
AlDERMAN SECOND WARD
The town council in regular session
Monday night elected A. Sutherland to
fill one of the vacancies existing in that
body for alderman in the second ward.
An effort was made to elect the second
membea from the same ward, as there
were two vacancies, but the vote re
sulted in a tie, two for J. B. Bear and
two for J. J. Maloney. The contest
will probably be renewed at the next
session.
A contract was let to Earl D. Covell
for the surveying of a water system
from some one of the mountain streams
east of town, being the necessary pre
liminary step toward the construction
of a water works system in Ronan.
In view of the necessity existing for
some protection against fire and to sup
ply the town with water for domestic
purposes, the action of the town coun
cil will be appreciated very much.
What should be done is bond the town
for all the valuation will stand and
put in water works at the earliest pos
sible date. The cry of economy and
keep out of debt never built any town
and Ronan will not prove an exception
to this universal rule.
WATER OF ST. MARY'S
FOR MILK RIVER FARMS
The waters of St. Mary's lake and
river, that have flowed into the Hud
son bay since they were created, today
are flowing into the Gulf of Mexico.
The big canal has been completed
that diverts the water from St. Mary's
into the Milk river to irrigate the fer
tile acres of that broad valley, and
water has been turned into it.
The engineers report the canal is
well built, but that as is usual with
new construction there is some seep
age. The canal will be puddled. how
ever, before water is necessary for the
1917 season.
The completion of this canal and the
diversion of the waters marks the
close of a fight for water in the Milk
river valley that began upwards of 20
years ago.
The timely rain of last Satur
day night and Sunday morning
settled the dust which was be
coming almost unbearable, and
likewise put a stop to harvesting
and threshing operations for sev
eral days. The fine weather
since is pleasing to all alike and
a continuance of same will be ap
preciated by everybody.
Evidently a youngster on the Chica
go News staff perpetrated this: "It is
up to the department of agriculture to
tell how to raise a respectable crop of
whiskers upon a heretofore arid face."
An old head would have put "hair"
for "whiskers" and "pate" for "face."
MIDNIGHT FIRE IN RONAN
DESTROYS MORE BUILDINGS
An alarm of fire caused Ronan people
to hurriedly respond Wednesday night
about 12 o'clock and upon reaching the
scene of the conflagration it was found
that the building containing the La
chambre harness shop was in flames.
So much headway had been made by
the fire that it was impossible to save
the contents of the building nor of the
pool hall and millinery establishment
adjoining. Those first on hand turned
their attention to saving the autos and
tools and fixtures in the Central garage
and Justice Bailey's office immediately
to the east of the buildings on fire.
Everything in both buildings was taken
out and carried to a safe distance and
blankets placed over the front of the
Ronan Mercantile Co. store across the
street. Willing wbrkers climbed to the
roof of this building and kept the
blankets wet with water carried from
Spring creek by a bucket brigade which
had been formed and it was soon evi
dent that the building would be saved.
Others were on the roof of the Cen
tral garage and this building was also
saved by heroic efforts, likewise Mr.
Bailey's office, although it was only
about ten feet from the one burned to
the ground. The side wall stood up
long enough to keep the hot flames
from directly communicating with this
building and this fact saved both the
office and the garage.
The origin of the fire is unknown, as
has been the case with about all the
fires in Ronan during the past six
years. The loss will run above $10,000,
with partial insurance.
Those burned out were Paul La
chambre, harness shop; Stinger & Co.,
pool hall, and Mattie Hull, millinery
and ladies' furnishings.

FRENCH ACTIVE
ALONG SOMME
Dislodge Germans from
Important Positions
London, Sept. 5.-Almost without 4
pause after their smash of Ssuday
against the German lines, the FieOch
resumed their onslaught north aiad
south of the Somme river and wtii
the British aiding to the north, drove
their lines still farther forward along
a front of twenty-five miles. Impor
tant German positions fell before the
advance.
South of the Somme the village of
Soyecourt and part of the village of
Vermandovillers were taken, while,
seemingly more important still, the
French made fresh progress east of
the village of Forest, which lies one
and one-half miles southeast of the
railroad town of Combles.
Five Thousand Germans Captured.
This gain, taken with the capture of
Guillemont by the British Sunday,
seemingly outflanks Combles and ap
parently renders it untenable.
Wore than 5,000 Germans have been
made prisoners north and south of tie
Somme in the last two days.
On the British right wing, progress
is reported north of Falfemont farm,
while a German counter-attack north
west of Moquet farm was repulsed.
In the Verdun sector Paris records a
fresh gain near Fleury.
Berlin, in admitting the claims of
British and French successes in the
fighting of Sunday in the Somme re
gion says the battling over the eight
ecn-mile front from Beaumont to the
Somme was one of the greatest fe
rocity.
The Germans held their ground at
Tliiepval, north of Pozieres, and near
Ginchey, but Guillemont village and
wood were lost, as likewise was Gin.
chy, but a counter-attack of the Gera
mans won back a portion of the latter
town, a
Russ Drive at Hungary.
Again there is heavy fighting on the
front in Russia west and southwest
of Lutsk and north of Zborow and
near Brezezany, in Galicia, with the
Russians generally the aggressors.
Petrograd controverts the assertion
of Berlin that the Russians obtained
only local successes near Brezerany
by the declaration that the Russians
won a victory over the Teutons here
and took 2,641 prisoners.
In the Carpathian region, according
to Petrograd, the Russians have cap
tured an entire series of heights and
are advancing to the Hungarian fron
tier.
Roumanians Press On.
All along the Transylvania front the
Roumanians continue to press their ad
vantage against the Austro-Hungari
ans. Here they have captured addi
tional towns and are said to be bom
harding the town of Hermannstadt,
which is second in importance only to
Kronstadt.
The Germans and Bulgarian forces
are attacking along the entire front
between Dobredja and Bulgaria. Near
Koemar, Berlin reports, the Rouman
ians were driven back with the loss of
700 men taken prisoners.
Italians Take Towns.
In Albania the Italians east of Av
lona have taken the villages of Kutal
and lirizar and Monte Gradist.
Considerable fighting is in progress
in the Austro-Italian theater, but with
out any important changes in terrain.
Berlin admits the loss of an airship
the night of Sept. 2, It is supposed
this is the Zeppelin which London re
ported was brought down during the
raid on London early Sunday morning.
Raiding Airships All Return.
London, Sept. 5.--All the Zeppelins
participating in the raid on London
returned undamaged, said an official
statement issued by the German ad
miralty, despite the fact that one of
the dirigibles was shot down near
London. The press bureau, in comr
menting on this statement, said that
not only was one Zeppelin destroyed.
but there is good reason to believe
that another was "very seriously dam
aged."
Liner Bore Charge of Murder.
Jersey City, N. J., Sept. 5.-Wadis
law Kubicci, living with his wife and
two children here, was arrested on a
warrant brought to this country by

four years ago, in Mecklenburg,
Schwerin, Prussia. The young wom
an was choked to death and her body
thrown in a pond.
