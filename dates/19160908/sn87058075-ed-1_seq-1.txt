Rural School Notes.
Vernon Springs township is to be
congratulated on the type of men they
have succeeded in placing on their
school board. No other board in the
county more readily co-operates with
the county superintendent's office for
the progress of their schools. In July
•a letter was sent to each director in
the., county recommending certain
measures for the schools. Among
these was the request that each school
board furnish a set of text books for
each school, for the teachers' use. Ver
non Springs alone complied with this
request. Of course, the books cost
something, and the bill may look large
now, but new books are adopted only
once in five years, and it means decid
edly better schools. It is difficult for a
teacher to say what books a pupil
should get when she hasn't seen the
books, but that is what a good many
will have to do and it will mean that a
large number of pupils will use books
that are not what they need. You may
think that the teachers should supply
these for themselves, but they are
never sure what they will be doing an
other year and they can't afford to sup
ply themselves with text-books that
may be of no value to them in differ
ent work, when there are so many
things that could be purchased at the
same cost, that are of value in any
school. If you are interested in hav
ing your teacher do her best work for
and

Ridgeway Sunday School Convention
The Winneshiek County Sunday
School Convention to be held in the
Ridgeway M. E. Church on next Mon
day and Tuesday, Sept. 11 and 12, will
be a rare opportunity for all Sunday
School workers, and others to gain
vision, inspiration and instruction.
Every Sunday School in our county
should be well represented at every
session, less than this will be a failure.
Every pastor, S. S. Supt., S.S. officer
and teacher should be present when
Rev. W. A. Sholer of Cresco opens the
Convention with prayer at 2 o'clock on
Monday afternoon and should remain
till the closing session on Tuesday ev
ening. Our State S. S. Sec'y., W. D.
Stem, will alone be worth your coming
to Ridgeway to hear, and then you will
have all the rest of the program be
sides.
If every S. S. officer and teacher in
your school is present with your pastor
and S. S. Supt. at three of the five
sessions, you will receive a valuable
book on S. S. officer's duties don't
cause your school to lose it.
Business people, farmers, any one
can afford to leave their place of busi
ness or the farm and give twojdaya of the
366 in this year, not to making money
but to make preparation for training our
boys and girls. Iowa's most valuable
asset. Ridgeway will entertain the
visitors. Come early and stay late.
1
you, let your school board know jt.
Ttey are willing to put money into any
good thing if they know the patrons
want it.
We want also, to congratulate the
people of»Florenceville district on hav
ing the cleanest school tyouse in the
county. I know of no other school
house in the county cleaned regularly
once a month. It pays.
This fall another series of township
picnicB will be held during the week of
September 18-23, following the plan of
last year. We shall present to you an
entirely different phase of endeavor,
Dr. A. E* Kepford of the State Board
of Control will lecture in each town
ship. Your coanty superintendent has
heard Dr. Kepford several times so we
jftow you will -enjoy Jiija. But ,tj&»t
fad may meet Win yoowelfbefore thr
picnics, we have planned to have him
here Saturday, Sept. 16th,' for the
county auto phrade which will start at
Elma early in the morning and pass
through Saratoga, Cresco, Bonair, Lime
Springs, Chester and Riceville, stop
ping at eacq town a few minutes. State
Supt. A. M. Deyoe will also be here to
greet you with a few words from the
department. We have tried several
times before, to get Mr. Deyoe but did
not succeed, and it is only through
special effort on his part that he will
be able to be with us at this time. We
want at least one auto load from each
district. The school officers and the
teacher of every district should plan to
make the tour with us. Each auto
should be decorated to show what dis
trict it represents. Much decoration
will not stand so long a trip, but every
one should have at least a cloth banner
or pennant to designate the district. It
should be firmly fastened to be in as
good condition at the last town as the
first.

'The
Jolly Musical Comedy Coming to
Cresco."
At last "September Morn" has been
jnusicalized. It was bound to occur at
fome time and the transforming of
Paul Chabas' painting into three acts
of musical comedy has happened.
Arthur Gillespie wrote the play Frank
Tannehill, Jr., staged it Virgil Bennett
taught "September Morn" how to
dance—but the arch- conspirator is
Wm. Moore, the original joy germ,
who is the star of the big musical com
edy along with Miss Ruth Wilkin?,
Maud K. Williams, Leslie Jones, J. J.
Patton, James Baber and others.
One nay imagine every musical {day
}they have ever seed—then combine the
lot lthd let it simmer down tliiitil it con
dense*, leaving "September Morn" a
genuine delight with its happy players
and tango dancing chorus of thirty.
"September Morn" carries the audi
ence upon a tour through fun land with
a dash and whirl of real pleasure.
"September Morn" comes with a La-
Salle Opera Hou§e, Chicago, reputa
tion to "The Cresco" theatre for one
night, Monday, Sept. 18th, 1916.

A Cracking Good Game.
Cresco defeated Monona by a score
of 3 to 2, making the second game from
this fast team, Wednesday. The game
was interesting from start to finish and
many sensational plays were made by
both teams Plopper making one, a
fast one at 3rd, and throwing his man
out at 1st. Cresco has a fast infield .*
and the outfield is exceptionally good,
consisting of John McCabe, Ben Mc
Cabe, and Walker. The infield con-,
sists of Isaacs, pitcher, Bowman, catch*
er, Sheppard 1st, Rathert 2nd, Davis
short stop, Plopper, 3rd, and if this
bunch could stick together a while they
would be as strong as any of them in
this section. Monona has a first-class
bunch of players and were assisted by
J. Palmer, of Dubuque, at 3rd, and
one of Farmersburg's best players.
Ballitt, their pitcher, who paints his
thumb with iodine and wraps it with
tape, gets a good fade-away and drop
by the assistance of the tape, most of
them cutting the plate below the knee,
and strikes have to be above the knea
and not over the shoulder. But ha
is O. K. as a pitcher. Cresco got 9
hits while Monona only got 5. Isaacs
was brought home by Bowm in's three
base hit to the fence. These two men
work together all the time and giva
great strength to our team.

the game was a disappointment to tha
fans, for at no time after the second
inning did Calmar get a man past

Isaacs loosened up a bit and Calmar
run in three- scores to the 14 Cresco
had accumulated in the eight innings.
The Cresco boys had no trouble in

Buys Prize Winning Hog.
M. P. Lydon returned last Saturday
from the state fair at De* Moines sf*
teJ an absence of ten days. He re*
ports a fine fair in every respect and a
large attendance every day, and old
hog men claim it the best hog show
ever held in Des Moines. Mr. Lydon
disposed of all the hogs he took there
for sale, all going to head good herds
in Iowa. He also purchased a fine big
type Poland China boar of the 1000 lb.
type and a prize winner in his class st
the neat sum of $100. He is a grand*
son of Mables Wonder, the first big
type boar that ever won a champion*
•hip at the Iowa state fair. This ho(
is known as "Black Crow" and can be
seen any time at his home on the Ver*
non road in Cresco.
