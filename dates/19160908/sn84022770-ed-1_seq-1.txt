PEACE PROVISION IN
WILSON'S NAVAL BILL
IMIKSIDKNT MAY STOP WARSHIP
CONSTRUCTION IF NATIONS
FAVOR WORLD-WIDE PEACE.
When the senate and house came
together and agreed upon President
Wilson's navy appropriation bill a
thrill of patriotism went round the
country.
A noteworthy provision of this
universally approved measure, but
one that has ben generally over
looked, lies In that paragraph which
empowers the president to suspend
construction of this colossal navy if
an international agreement limiting
armaments can be effected at the
close of the present war.
So, after all, this bill for national
preparedness makes for peace.
In the momentary impulse of pa
triotism caused by this long step
toward defense It may have been
overlooked by many that the navy
appropriation bill, while undergoing
the changes made in conference, had
a good strong olive branch tacked on
it, and while it will put this country
in a position, as Admiral Dewey has
said, to stand up before any sea
power on the globe, it carries, too, a
specific provision for the preserva
tion of world-wide peace.
The text of these provisions reveals
the plan of the administration to
work for international disarmament
and also shows that big economies
might even be effected in the appro
priations of 1916. The new para
graph reads as follows:
Disarmament Provisions.
"Upon the conclusion of the war in
Europe, or as soon as it may be done,
the president of the United States is
authorized to invite all the great
governments of the world to send
representatives to a conference which
shall be charged with the duty of sug
gesting an organization, a court of
arbitration or other body, to which
disputed questions between nations
Bhall be referred for adjudication and
peaceful settlement and to consider
the question of disarmament and sub
mit their recommendations to their
respective governments for approval.
The president is hereby authorized
to appoint nine citizens of the United
States who in his judgment shall be
qualified for such duty to be repre
sentatives of the United States in
such a conference. * _* * The
president is authorized to fix the com
pensation of the commissioners. * * *
A lum of $200,000 is appropriated to
carry Into effect this provision. * * •
"If at any time before the appro
priations authorized by this act shall
have been contracted for there shall
have been established, with the coop
eration of the United States of Amer
ica, an International tribunal or tri
bunals, competent to secure peaceful
determination of all international dis
putes, and which shall render unnec-
eßsary the maintenance of competitive
armaments, then and in that case
such naval expenditures as may be
inconsistent with engagements made
In the establishment of such tribunal
or tribunals may be suspended when
BO ordered by the president of the
United States."
May Never Spend Money.
This naval appropriation bill may
not only be the last of such size ever
to be passed for armament, but It is
entirely possible, aB may be seen from
the above quoted paragraphs, that
much of the money authorized for
naval construction may never be
spent at all.
The administration is working
around to the idea of a league to
enforce peace, as Intimated in one of
the apeches of the president last
spring. The United States would be
billing to put its bulk of force in the
arch that would support the peace of
the world. Such an arrangement,
however, must take into consideration
the limitation immediately of naval
armaments since this is the most
costly Item of all. And the Washing
ton government is preparing to move
decisively toward that end as soon as
the European war is over.
Richard Purcell filed suit this week
against Mrs. J. M. Bushnell, proprie
tor of a large farm on Chambers'
Prairie, for $l6O he alleges to be due
him as wages.

Tono and a picked team from the
Tacoma City league battled 15 in
nings to a 2 to 2 tie Labor Day, the
game being called on account of
darkness. Patterson of Tacoma saved
the day for his team when he banged
out a triple in the ninth with two
men on bases.
The game was a feature of Tono's
observance of the day. There were
sports of all kinds during the day,
and the program closed with a dance
at night. Addresses were made in
the morning by Superintendent E. S.
Brooks of the Washington Union Coal
company and Ernest Newsham, vice
president of this district of United
Mine Workers. It is estimated that
Tono entertained 700 visitors for the
celebration.
PRAISE N FOR
PREVENTING STRIKE
REPUBLICAN AND INDEPENDENT
NEWSPAPERS GIVE PRESI
DENT CREDIT.
President Wilson's resolute stand
in the railroad controversy, which has
succeeded in averting a nation-wide
strike, is receiving the cordial ap
proval of many/Republican and inde
pendent newspapers as well as the
whole-hearted support of the Demo
cratic press.
Newspapers which are supporting
Mr. Hughes frankly assert that the
president is entitled to the thanks of
the country for preventing what most
of them describe as a "national calam
ity which threatened to destroy the
industrial peace of the country," and
the president is warmly applauded for
the courage and wisdom with which
he met the situation. Some of these
comments follow:
New York Herald (independent
Republican): "The country has Just
escaped a railroad strike which
threatened to involve the entire coun
try, which menaced our national
peace, our national existence; which
would have dislocated the entire so
cial fabric, and might have led to a
long procession of ills so serious that
to contemplate them is abhorrent,
innd it has been averted through the
resolute action of President Wilson."
The Herald, repeating what it had
iSaid before, commented Tuesday:
j "All honor to Mr. Wilson for hav
ing induced congress to pass the bill
which led to the rescinding of the
strike order, but what individual who
lis engaged in criticising this act of
congress, what editor, what railroad
preisdent, what member of congress
who voted 'No,' what economist who
would have settled the matter In
some way unexplained—what single
individual would have accepted the
responsibility of letting the strike be
gin?
"President Wilson has shown great
ability by the decisive part he took
In the railroad crisis, and congress Is
entitled to the thanks of the country,
not only for preventing a strike that
would have been a national calamity,
but for passing a national eight-hour
law for men In actual train service.
For this law is right and Just, with
out regard to the extraordinary cir
cumstances of Its enactment."
Binghampton Press (independent):
"Yet the president has sought to
favor neither side in this controversy.
He has indeed expressed his desire to
go to any lesgth possible to preserve
j industrial peace. He has acted for
the larger interests of the public, and
his course has not met with the un
i qualified approval of the workers nor
'of the railroad managers, but it has
met with the general approval of the
public. The public believes there is
'nothing unreasonable In the proposal
to make an eight-hour day the basis
for computing wages."
Chicago Examiner (independent):
"The president has acted with cour
age and wisdom and his decision is
right. The railroad presidents will
doubtless issue several proclamations
to the country saying that the liber
ties of the people are being over
thrown and that all private property
is in peril, but in the end yield."
St. Louis Post Dispatch (Independ
ent): "Legislation on the subject of
railroad strikes has just begun. The

OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1916
TUMWATER PIONIER DIES
AT A TACOMA HOSPITAL
Mrs. Susie A. Rabbison, One of Olyin
pia's Founders, Succumbs to
Long Illness.
Mrs. Susie A. Kabbison, 81 years
old, an 1850 pioneer of the state of
Washington and a member of the
party that founded Olympia, died at
a Tacoma hospital Monday, following
an illness of several weeks. The
death of Mrs. Rabbison marks the
passing of one of the oldest pioneers
of the state and one who was an ac
tive figure in the pioneer days of
Washington. From 1850 until 1907
she lived at Tumwater on the old
homestead that was settled when the
state was in its infancy.
In the pioneer days of the early
'sos Mrs. Kabbison, with her family
of seven children, took an active part.
When the Indians rose up in revolt
against the invasion of the white man
the story is told how many pioneers
found shelter and protection at the
Rabbison home.
The first grist mill erected on
Puget Sound was built by Mr. Rabbi
son upon his arrival-at Tumwater.
To this mill pioneers from all parts of
the Sound came with their bags of
wheat and went home with flour to
tide them over the winter.
Owing to the fact that it sometimes
took days to get all the flour ground,
the Rabbison home became a commu
nity center for the pioneers and there
is said to be hardly an old resident in
this part of the state who does not
remember the impartial hospitality of
Mrs. Rabbison.
Mrs. Rabbison is survived by three
children. One daughter, Mrs. J. H.
Foultz, of Tacoma, and two sons, Ed
and Charley Rabbison, reside in this
city.
SCHOOL EXHIBITS TO BE
FEATURE OF COUNTY FAIR
Five Local Pupils Will Compete in
Contest at State Show at
North Yakima.
One of the leading features of the
second annual Thurston County Fair
next week will be the agricultural
industrial exhibit of the schools of
the county, made up of the best dis
plays entered in the various commu
nity exhibits that are being held
throughout the county this week.
The displays of the city schools and
of the districts in this vicinity are
being shown at the public library,
while the various country districts
are combining in displays at Tum
water, Yelm, Lacey, Rainier, Roch
ester, Tenino, Little Rock, Grand
Mound and South Bay. Ribbons are
given as prizes to the best exhibits at
these community displays.
At the County Fair next week
County Superintendent O. C. Goss
will select, after contests, three girlß
to represent Thurston county at the
state-wide agriculural-lndustrial con
test at the State Fair at Yakima Sep
tember 18-23, and two boys who will
compete in a stock-judging contest
there. The girls will compose a can
ning team. Boys and girls from
practically every county in the state,
chosen at the county contests, will
attend the State Fair, where a regu
lar camp will be maintained. All ex
penses of the children will be paid
and special cash prizes will be award
ed the winners.
Non-Parti* an Meeting Saturday.
Call for a non-partisan mass meet
ing at Eagles' hall at 1:30 Saturday
afternoon, to discuss candidates for
the primaries next Tuesday, was
issued by the Non-Partisan committee
this week. The committee is anxious
for a large attendance at this meeting
of those who are interested in the
non-partisan movement, so that a
general discussion of the primary can
didates on all the tickets may be had.
Edison to Support Wilson.
Thomas A. Edison, inventor, life
long Republican, and a strong sup
porter of Theodore Roosevelt's candi
dacy for the Republican nomination,
announced this week his intention to
vote and work for Woodrow Wilson.
Mrs. R. C. Vanderveer and son of
Everett visited Mr. and Mrs. W. H.
Algier this week.
COUNTY TO RAISE $30,000
LESS IN TAXES FOB 1917
Big Cash Balance anil Proposed Cut
in Road and Bridge Levy
Responsible.
Reductions that will make the
amount of money to be raised by
taxes in Thurston county next year at
least $30,000 less than this year are
being made by the county commis
sioners in the proposed allowances
for the different county departments
which they expect to complete some
time Friday. The budget will not be
finally adopted until October, after
taxpayers have had an opportunity to
confer with the board.
Owing to the possibility that the
budget law subject to I he referendum
at the November election may be
adopted, the commissioners have had
to revise entirely the system of mak
ing up the annual budget, eliminat
ing the general current expense fund
and apportioning to each department
the expenses previously paid in bulk
from this fund. In arriving at this
result Uiey have been conferring with
A 1 Helander of the state bureau of
inspection.
Some $20,000 of the reduction
will come from the cash paid the
county by the Weyerhaueeer Timber
company on delinquent taxes levied
in previous years, the commissioners
anticipating that there will be at
least that much on hand in the cur
rent expense fund at the end of this
year. A further cut. of $7,000 in the
general road and bridge fund, as the
result of a proposed reduction of half
a mill in that levy, and smaller re
ductions in other departments, will
make the total cut about $30,000.
The county raised practically
$240,000 this year for the expenses
of Its government and the $30,000
cut would mean a reduction of about
2 mills in the county levy, were it
not for the fact that the valuations
are a half a million dollars less this
year.
COUNCIL PROVIDES FOR
BETTER FIRE PRUTECTIUN
Orders More Hydrants Installed
Will Buy 1,000 Feet of

man, reporting on the condition of
the Are hose, stated that the city has
SOO feet of new hose and about 3,500
feet of old, which will stand a 95-
pound pressure, that 600 feet of hose
had been turned over to the street
department and 400 feet discarded,
and that the acid spoiled about 200
feet of hose. The call for bids on the
new supply, which will not be paid for
until next year, Is published else
where in this issue.

EVERYTHING HEADY
FOR SECOND FAIR
ANNUAL SHOW NEXT WEEK EX
PECTED TO BE LAfMiEIt IN
ALL FEATURES.
Larger displays, agriculturally, in
dustrially and otherwise, more con
cessions and special features and a
better racing card will greet the vis
itors to Thurston County's Second
Annual Fair than a year ago, which,
according to the management, will
mean a larger attendance for the six
day affair which opens next Monday
at the Carlyon grounds. The fair
management announces that it is
ready as this week draws to a close
for the opening Monday.
Monday is entry day. There will
be a committee in charge to take care
of exhibits entered, the last of which
must be made by 6 o'clock that even
ing. Those who show up later will
lose the opportunity of winning pre
miums.
By Tuesday everything will be in
full swing, with the first races booked
for that afternoon. There 'will be
races eyery afternoon except Mon
day. L. L. Snow, secretary of the
fair, states that he expects, in addi
tion to the races already booked, to
place a number of other fast steppers
in the fair barns. He will go tomor
row to Elma to get in further touch
with owners who this week have their
horses on the turf at the fair there.
It is announced that all races will be
over-night entries, meaning that en
tries for the following day must be
made the previous evening. The
farmer's trotting race promises to be
a feature of the card.
Wednesday Olympia Day.
Wednesday is Olympia Day. Mayor
Mottman has issued a proclamation
declaring a half-holiday on that day
and practically every store will b«
closed during the afternoon so that
all Olympians can attend the fair. An
urgent request is made by the Cham
ber of Commerce that the business
men and all citizens make plans to
attend on Wednesday particularly
and make It a banner day. The
Olympia band will play during the
afternoon and there will be a baseball
game early in the afternoon between
picked teams.
Friday is Children's Day, when all
grade school children will be admit
ted free of charge. The school or ed
ucational exhibit, the arrangements
for which are in charge of County
Superintendent O. C. Goss, promises
to be much larger and even superior
to the exhibit last year.
The fair closes Saturday and the
largest attendance of the week is ex
pected that day.
With the exhibit tents open during
the entire day, it has been decided by
the management to close them at 6
o'clock, thus giving full swing in the
evening to the gayer part of the fair
—concessions, attractions, etc. The
grounds, however, will be closed at
10 o'clock each evening and night
watchmen will be on hand to safely
guard entries.
Good Judges for the exhibits have
been secured, among them being H.
L. Blanchard of the Western Wash
ington Experiment Station.
Auto Dealers to Exhibit.
The automobile men are taking
especial interest this year and J. B.
Eshom. the Rose-Nepple Auto Co., B.
C. Tew and St. John & Tituß have
engaged tent space for exhibit pur
poses. Many other concerns are tak
ing exhibit space, and the fair man
agement urges individuals or Arms
engaged in special lines to make ar
rangements for space, thus helping
their business and at the same time
boosting the fair. Farmers are also
requested to do everything possible
to make their displays as large as
possible.
"We want the seven large tents
filled to capacity with grain and veg
etables and the stock sheds also
filled," says Secretary Snow. "A
splendid showing can be made if the
right sort of interest is taken in t»
home county. From all appearances
the Fair will be greater by far than
last year. More concessions have
being sold at present than a year arfo,
plenty of inquiries are coming from
the horsemen and some excellent
rares will take place, provided the
weather conditions are right. We
