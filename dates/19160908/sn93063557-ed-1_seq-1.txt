A statementin fnvorof tho cnnilidacy
of JudgoJohn 13. WeekH forUoutennnt.
Governor over the algnaturea of Moaars.
T. M. Clmpmnn, Willls N. Cwly, nml
Allan Cnlhoun, haa nppoarod in the
Stato papora this wcek. Tho stnto-
rnent Is bb followa:
"Tho clnlms of John 13. Wooks upon
tho Republican nominiitlon for Llciiten
ant Governor of Vermont reat upon hla
clinractur na n mnn, 1i!h cxporlonco ns u
leglslutor, hls lldollty nntl usofulncaa aa

ns n businosa man nnd na n presiding
oflleer.
"Judge Weeka haa apent his lifo in
Addison County, nn activo fnnnur nnd
business man, nnd no man in Vermont
standB higher in tho reapect of his
noighbors for uprightnesa and atrength
of chnracter. He is tho kind of man
peoplo trustnnd towhom they go for
counsel. Those who know him best nro
liis wnrmeat ndmirers. IIu ia a natural
loader, has long been nctive in public
nlfairs, and hls record in every position
of trusthos been elenn nnd honornblo.
"Judge Weeks .woultl wme to tho
Lieuteniint-Govornorship stniight from
a succeessul exporienco ns presiding of
ficer of the lower Houso, having been
Speaker in 1915. It is gonerally ngreed
that hc mnde ono of the bost apenkors
Vermont lias ever hnd. Fair and squnre
toward all, nover carriod nway by
purtisnnahip, not undertnking to dic
tate, ho commandcd tho respect and
all'ection of his fellow-legislators to nn
unusual degree. As a meniber of the
last two legislatures and a Stato oilicor
for the past ten years he is thoroughly
informed on the business of tho Stato,
and is in position to render invaluable
service in the eoming session.
"Judge Weeks' chief interestin lifo is
notin his privato nffairs, norin political
promotion, but in the unfortunate
citizens of our Stntc in our penal insti
tutions, especially the boys and girls
in tho Industrial School. Foreighteen
years he has been a trustee of that
school, and since tho organization of the
Penal Board under the late Fletcher D.
Proctor in 1906 he has been its chnir
man. Under his leadorship the Indus
trial School has been rebuilt, not only in
buildings, but nlso in spirit and charnc
ter. It is no longer a place of punish
ment, but n real school where boys and
girls who have been negleeted and
abused are given a chance and become
worthy and useful citizens. Judge
Weeks knows those children by nume,
and they know him and honor and love
him. He has spent time and nioney for
their welfare, and the high rank which
the Industrial School has attained and
it stnntls as one of the best in the
United States is tlue largely to his
efforts.
"Judge Weeks is a farmer. He owns
today the farm on which he was born,
nnd makes it pay. ' He is a business
man, one of the most successful in tho
State. He is the friend of workingmen,
not in words on the stump but in every
day relations with them and in votes as
a legislator. He is a reprosentative of
the plain, honest people of Vermont, a
man they can trust and count on every
time. He is a man of ability as a
leader, as his record proves. He is the
sort of man Vermont will do well to put
forward. Entangled by no alliances
with any candidate for any other ollice,
if chosen Lieutenant-Governor he will
discharge the cluties of the oflice with
no other purpose than to do his utmost
for the good of Vermont.
"Addison County, which has had only
one Governor or Lieutenant-Governor
for forty-four years, presents John E.
Weeks for the second place on the
Republican ticket with eonfidence that
no better candidate could be chosen.
"On your primary ballot September
12th, under Lieutenant Governor, put a
cross opposite the name of John E.
Weeks."
