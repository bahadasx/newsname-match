JOUR LAW
Railroad Company Will Car
ry Case to the Supreme
Court
STATEMENT TO THLPUBLIC
Topeka, Kan., Sept. 0. E. R. Rip
ley, president of the Atchison, To
peka & Santa Fe railway, declared in
a formal statement tonight that the
f Santa Fe does not intend to comply
with the Adamson Kight-Ilour Day
Law, recently enacted by congress to
avert a threatened railroad strike, un
til ordered to do so by the United
States Supreme Court.
President Itipley declared that the
so-called eight-hour law was nothing
more than an advance of 20 to 25
per cent in wages to the men who re
ceive tiie most money in the railway
service.
Mr. Ripley's statement follows:
"Congress, hastily acting under a
threat of four leaders ofTabor organ-
- izations, enacted a so-called eight.
hour law, which is nothing more
than an advance of 20 to 25 per cent
in wages of the best paid men in the
railway service. It is only fair to
the public and to our employes to
say that tiie Atchison, Topeka &
Santa Fe Railway Company does not
intend to comply with the law until
ordered to do so by the court of last
resort."

GAR SHORTAGE

Shortage
Coal cars continue scarce on the
Henderson division and local mines
have been idle several days-this week
because there were no empty gons.
Some of the mines were operated
daily while others suspended oper
ation. If gon were available the lo
cal mines could operate daily, but as
there is a scarcity, the St. Bernard
Mining Company has not been able
to operate all of their mines on the

THE
"BIRTH OF A NATION"
COMING TO HOPKINSVILLE
It will be welcome news to resi
dents hereabout the D. W. Griffith's
much-discussed distorical spectacle,
"The Birth of a Nation," has been
booked for the Tabernacle in Hop-
kinsvillejfor two days immediately
before its return engagement at the
Vendome Theatre, Nashville, during
the Tennessee State Fair week. The
Spectacle will be presented in Hop
kinsville Friday and Saturday, Sept
15th and 16th, with a symphony or
chestra of 25 and the complete stage
effects, exactly as it will be seen in
Nashville.
"The Birth of a Nation" will not
be shown within fifty miles of Hop
kinsville and the Tabernacle engage
ment will afford people within tint
radius their only opportunity to see
it. Although it is sometimes referred
to as a moving picture, the fact is
that the services of fifty people are
employed in each presentation of the
spectacle and a carload of special
equipment is used. It can be pre
sented only in theatres and auditor
iums having large seating capacity.
Mr. Griffith has persistently stated
that his masterpiece will never be
shown in moving picture theatres.
As most readers of the newspapers
and magazines know,- the story of
"The Birth of a Nation" is taken
from Thomas Dixon's romance of
the Confederacy, "The Clansman."
Eighteen thousand people and 3,000
horses are seen in its great battle
scenes and among the historical events
depicted are President Lincoln sign
ing his first call for volunteers, Sher
man's march through Georf ia, the
burniugof Atlanta,. Lee and Giant
at Appomattox, the assassination of
Lincoln in Ford's theatre, Washing
ton, and the rise of the Ku Klux
Klan. It cost $500,000 to produce
the spectacle and each presentation
lasts 3 hours.
The Friday and Saturday night
performances in Hopkinsville will be
gin at 8 o'clock and the Saturday
matinee will begin at 2:30. The
prices will be: Nights $1 and $1.50;
Matinee 75c and $1 00, children un
der 14, will be admitted to any seat
at the matinee for 50c All except
children matinee tickets will be on
sale at Anderson-Fowler Drug Co's
Store, Eopkinsville, after Tuesday
morning, Sept. 12 , and there will
be no extra charge for tickets pur
chased in advance. Remittance pay

MAYOR RASH REPLIES
To Article in The Bee in Re
gards to Good Roads
The following letter is self-explan
atory and is published that the people
and property owners of Earlington
may see how the matter stands.
Communications from Earlington
property owners answering Mr. Rash's
query as to "what is the bejtplan"
will be gladly received and published.
Earlington, Ky., 9 7 '16
Mr J. E. Fawcett, Mgr ,
The Bee
City:-
Dear Sir:
I note in the Bee of Sept.
5th in an article headed "What about
the Dixie Bee Line" thit you u-.e this
language "the State and County have
done their part, how about Earlington
doing her part."
Did you know that the State's part
is due the Towns the same as it is due
the County on inter County seat
roads?
The law is that the Towns are en
titled to State aid. but it must be ob
tained by application to, and through
the Fiscal court.
Such application has been made in
proper form to our Fiscal Court, also
to the Commisioner of Public Roads,
as the law requires, but no action has
been taken (We understand the
Court has appropriated all the funds
they have for this purpose.)
Besides, it appears that' unless
Bonds are is ued we could not get
State Aid as we have to yut up Dol
Iar for Dollar of the State money,
and it is known by all of our Citizens
who are familiar with our Financial
conditions that except by a Bond is
sue we could not build any number
of squares.
Some have urged a" Bond issue
while others have wanted to build
on the plan of two-thirds against the
property owners, and tone-third to
be paid by the city.
The contractors will not bid on
work, except the City pays all of the
Contract price, and except where pe
titioned by Property owners we can
not build on tills plan.
We all want good roads.
What is the best plan?
Yours Truly,
. W. E. Rash
Mayor.

Prof. C. E. Dudley, in com

desires all parents and guardians
to soe'that the children under
their control begin s c.h o o 1
promptly and attend rrgolirly.
We expect to have a splendid
school this year and the patrons
of the school oraurted to work in
conjunction with the principal
and teachers to this end.
In order to have a successful
school absence and tardiness
must be eliminated as far as
possible aud no child shouid be
allowed to remain out of school
unless absolutely necessary
Eirlington has one of the best
schools in this.cnd of tho state
and a number of out of town
pupils will attend this session.
Eirlington has a right to be
proud of the John B. A kinson

The Drink Traf
fic Unnatural
The liquor press vociferously as
serts that as long as men want drink
they will get it.
What they mean is that men will
get drink as long as the liquor Inter
ests can induce them to do so. If
the American public were supplied
only with .the liquor it would go out
of its way to get, and not subjected
to the suggestion and compulsion of
advertising, free lunches, pool tables
and innumerable social, political and
economic schemes, there would be
very little liquor consumed.
No. The vicious liquor trade is
projected upon American society by
the men who make money out of it.

THE UNPOPULAR
EIGHT-HOUR DAY
Tho eight-hour day which rail
road men want is a "basic eight-
lionr day" with "pro rate over
time" in some circumstances and
and "punitive" or' "time and a
half" ovortimo in othor circum
stances.
That eight hours for werk and
eight for sleep and eight for
play is beneficial to tho physical
man is agreed generally, but
very few men, comparatively
speaking, want to work no more
than eight hours a day. Any
number of men will clamor for
or legislate for an eight-hour day
for themselves or for some other
class with whom thoy hayo little
in common, But few earnest
workers want to stop short when
ieight hours have elapsed and go
lforthtoplay eight hours before
i Ieeping that length of time.
Pay, as a rule, is not free of
cost. Unless a man is pretty well
off he is saving in two ways in
his own calculations when he is
it work. He is saving what he
would spend if he were not at
work, and he is saving what ho
would not earn if he wero play
ing. So the average industrious
mau who has a job at which he
works only eight hours finds
something to do "on the outside"
and turns an honest dollar in
that way.
The eight-hour day is a popu
lar ideal, bnt an unwanted real
ity. The normal human being
knows well enough that play
often is harder upon the con
stitution than work. He knows
that when he. plays he often sits
up too late playing not only
poker but also playing at danc
ing with Idle young girls who
may sloep when he is work, or
playing with his favorite auth
ors, or in other ways stealing
from his sleep time a little more
play than lie ought to have, but
his work rarely exhausts him.
That is, it does not if he makes
a liberal allowance of time for
sleep, Aud as he gains exper
ience of life, and learns the
many excellent uses to which
every extra doll tr can be put; as
he grows middle-aged and sees
how well those faro who have
worked overtime rather than
played overtime, he loses the
enthusiasm for short hours which
has caused him, perchance, to
express himself vigorously in be
half of the right of mankind not
to work more than one-third of
the time.
The world is full of persons
who look about and raauy of
iboui succeed in their soaroh
for something extra tdaltoill re
turn a profit. Rich nv who
iro well burdened with business
take on other responsibilities.
Poot men whoso salaries aro in
sufficient to meet their own re
quirements or tho requirements
of their growiug families get
"piece work" of some kind to
help along. A great nerve spec
ialist wrote poputar novels. He
did it for recreation, he said, but
it paid him handsomely, He
worked fourteen hours a day,
maybe, as a nerve specialist, and
didn't wear out his own nerves,
and when ho had a vacation he
ttat down aud wrote novels, and
was not k'lled by a sedentary
life. n didn't lead a sedentary
life. He walked about, perhaps,
between chapters, but ho did not
devote a third ot the time to
play ; uot even a third of his va
oat inn.
