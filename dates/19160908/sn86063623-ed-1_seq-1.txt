ATHLETICS WIN AND LOSE.
After Losing First Battle 1 to 0,
They Trimmed Maxwell's
8 to 4.
The two ball games between
the Maxwell's, of Kansas City
and the local team Sunday and
Monday, resulted in an even
break for the home team. They
lost Sunday's game 1 to 0 in ten
innings and it was undoubtedly
the best ball game seen here
this season. The Maxwell's are
the only team in the City that
has succeeded in beating the
pace setting Schmelzers. The
Athletics did not play the rag
ged brand of ball that they put
up against Odessa, but played
in big league style. Manager
Drummond Brown had instilled
his players with a fighting spirit
and lots of pep that was notice
able to the end. For nine innings
neither side scored, but in their
half of the first extra inning the
visitor's second man up lifted
the ball over the right field wood
work for two bases and scored
when Harding misjudged a
long fly, which would have
meant the third out and the
score would not have counted
had he caught it.
The game was a pitchers duel
between Beltz, a southpaw and
premier boxman for the Max
well's, and William Campbell also
of Kansas City. Lexington got
5 hits off Beltz and Campbell
allowed the motor boys 7.
The second game on Monday
was won by the locals 8 to 4
After the first inning Lexing
ton took the lead and held it
throughout the game. Beltz
was sent bnck to the mound for
the Maxwells, but was hit hard.
Brown of Sedalia started to
work for the Athletics and
pitched good ball for 5 innings,
the score being 5 to 2 when he
retired. Campbell replaced him
and pitched the same invincible
ball the remainder of the game.
Campbell was formerly of Se
dalia and succeeded in white
washing the Athletics, while
pitching for them, but when the
Sedalia team went to pieces, he
was secured by the local mana
gers. Campbell is a nifty pitch
er, the fastest infielder on the
team, a good, sure hitter and has
a baseball head. The "little
fellow" has certainly won the
fans of this town, and everyone
that goes to a game now is for
Ihe Athletics.
Another baseball treat next
Sunday, when Schmelzers come
back. Batteries: K. C, Dunn
and Ilannon; Lexington, Camp
bell and Shinn.

Serat Wiley Going to Arkansas.
Serat Wiley, son of Capt. and
Mrs. B. T. Wiley, will leave Sat
urday, September 16, for Mays-
Iville, Arkansas, where he will
assist Mrs. Dora Meng, former
ly of Dover, in managing a
drug store. Mr. Wiley is one of
Lexington's' most promising
and popular young men and one
whom Lexington can ill afford
to lose. He has been connected
with the Crenshaw & Young
drug store for several years and
made good. The Intelligencer
joins with his many friends in
wishing him all kinds of success.
Programs Gave Good Satisfac
tion. May Return Next
Year.
The Chautauqua was conclud
ed Tuesday night with the Child
ren's Pageant and the Ada
Roach Concert Co. The pro
grams this year' included many
numbers of unusual merit for a
Chautauqua and numbers which
made the general average all
that could be expected. It was
by far the best chautauqua the
people of this community have
had the opportunity to enjoy,
et the pledges for tickets next
year has not reached the point
where it is at all certain that
the chautauqua will return. It
is absolutely up to the people ; it
is their show, and if there are
not enough tickets pledged
within a few days, there will be
no chautauqua. Those who
are in favor of the chautauqua
and would attend next year and
have not already subscribed,
would favor the committee by
communicating with J. C.
Graddy, Lexington, Mo.
11 Join in Makina a Pleasant
and Profitable Day.
Labor Day was strictly observ
ed in Lexington Monday by
all of the people. The day was
given to recreation and pleasure.
The Unions had provided a pro
gram that was intended to
reach every class of people; it
as so varied that everyone, ex
cept the cronic grouch, could
find something that appealed to
them in the way of recreation.
There was music all dav. Jack
Bell's band did yeomanry service
for the crowds which was con-
tantly shifting from one place
o another. The aeroplane made
two flights, one in the morning
and again in the afternoon. This
was something new for Lexing
ton people and thoroughly en
joyed by all who saw it. The
other attractions included wrest
ling and boxing matches, speech
making, baseball, etc. All this
combined with the Chautauqua
?ave everyone an opportunity to
forget labor and enjoy a day of
complete relaxation.
All Drunk But One.
It would appear from the
record of the police court that
booze is about the only excuse
for the court's existence. Mon
day, two tourists, Nels Peterson
and Henry Stolzenbach, were
charged with being drunk and
ordered to leave town.. Georgia
Brown, ditto, was fined $5.73,
which was paid in cash.
Monday several parties from
Richmond celebrated Labor Day
improperly. They faced the
Judge Tuesday to answer
to the charge of drunkeness and
were fined $5.75 each. They
gave their names as Oliver Bak
er, Bud Smith, and Thomas
Parris.
The local round-up included
Fred Jackson, colored, charged
Paul Garigan of the Hurst
Paper Company of San Francis
co, California, who accompanied
Ernest Graendorf here for a
visit with Mr. Graendorf's
mother, left yesterday for a
business trip through the East
before returning to his home.
Mr. Graendorf accompanied him
is far as Kansas City for a visit.

supplied by the Missouri College
of Agriculture, depends largely
on what the farmers of the

then cooperate with him in
uich a way as to get the best
possible results.

Everyone cordially invited.
Inventor Commends the Presi
dent's Mexican Policy and
His Open Mind.
Thomas A. Edison has de
clared his intention to work and
vote for the reelection of Wood
row Wilson. This announce
ment was the cream of the
news from the Democratic Nat
ional Committee's headquarters
Monday.
Mr. Edison makes the follow
ing statement:
"More than any other Presi
dent in my memory Wilson has
been faced by a succession of
tremendous problems, any one
of which decided the wrong way
would have had disastrous con
sequences. Wilson's decisions
so far have not got us into ser
ious trouble, nor are they like
ly to.
"He has given us peace with
honor. This talk about the
United States being despised is
all nonsense. WTith reference
to Mexico, I think the President
has acted wisely, justly and
courageously. I do not believe
that we should have intervened,
nor do I believe we should inter
vene now.
"Both against England and
against human slavery the
United States worked out its
salvation through revolution,
and it was a pretty slow, trying
process.
"It has been said that at first
Wilson was against prepared
ness, but that when convinced
jthat intelligent public opinion
was ovd vv'.'ielniinfeiy in favor of
; it he changed. That is the prop
; er thing for our Presidents to
j do. His attitude on the tariff
, shows an equal openness of
mind. They say he has blun
dered. Perhaps he has. You
