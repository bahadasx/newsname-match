the one object of securing an amend
ment to the United States constitu
tion enfranchising woiten. She said
the chief work of the party at this
time is to convince congress that the
suffrage amendment should be pass
ed In this session but if congress ad
journs without taking such action,
the Woman's Party would hold the
Democratic party rsponsible for the
failure of the amendment since the
Democrats through their majority In
both branches can pass such legisla

opposition of tie Democratic party

NEARLY 4,000,000 AUTOMOBILES
OWNED IN UNITED STATES
Automobiles are becoming so cheap
that it will not be long before It is as
natural for a family to keep a motor
car as to have a telephone. It In
staggering when one stops to reallzo
the cost of even the motor car. If
one puts the average cost of an auto
mobile at $500, which is considerably
lower than the true average, the
value of the 2,445,664 cars which the
government census recently announc
ed were . registered In the United
States In 1916, reaches In the aggre
gate $1,222,832,000. This is the
sortiof a figure that one -uses in
speaking of a first-class power' or the
cost of many months of the great
war. It is quite outside the ordinary
comprehension.
The most .sanguine prophets nre-
dicted that the year 1916 would Bee
1,500,000 cars produced in America.
For once these prophets are cloaked
with honor in their own country, for
that production seems certain to be
reached. In a careful compilation of
the figures for the first six months
of the year made by The Automobile
our factories were found to have pro
duced 754,902 passenger automo-
oiief. It is not hard to see that with
the speeding up of production usual
in the second half of the year the
1,500,000 mark is sure to be attain
ed.
When these 1,500,000 cars are
added to those in opration on Jan
uary l last it will be seen that at
.least 3,945,664 automobiles will be
lowned in the United States. This
total will represent an investment of
,$2,000,000,000 in round figures, bas
ed on the $500 a car unit, which is
certainly far too low.

COPPERMINES COMPANY,
RESUMES OPERATIONS
Contract waR signed this week for
the remodeling of the Giroux concen
trator at Kimberly. The concentrator
will be equipped with the Callow sys
tem of flotation and will be put In
,shape to handle 500 tons of ore a
day.
Rumors that the Giroux was going
to start up were current in Ely the
first of the week and in order to con
firm them a wpresentatlve of the
Record visited Kimberly on Wednes
day and interviewed G. N. P. Dougall,
superintendent of the Giroux com
pany at the company's offices. Mr.
Dougall confirmed the reports in cir
uclation and stated that, a contract
had been let to the General Engineer
ing company of Salt Lake City for
the remodeling of the mill. J. M.
Callow, inventor of the Callow sys
tem of flotation and many other Im
provements in concentrating methods
Is the president of the General En
gineering company.
It is expected that the concentrator
will be in shape for business In about
90 days. In preparation for the period
of active production, Mr. Dougall has
already started a small force of men
at work at the Morris shaft. The
shaft will be unwatered and will later
be sunk 250 feet deeper in order to
get under the ore bodies which will
be worked by the caving system.

TUNATE AFFAIR TAKEN FROM AN IDAHO PAPER
Water for the mill will be numoed
from the old Giroux shaft. The supply
rrom this source will be ample for a
500-ton plant or even for 1000 tons if
it should later be decided by the man
agement to increase the plant to that
capacity. The old mill building is
ample in size ta house the machinery
for a 1000-ton pant as under the flo
tation system a arger tonnage can
be handled with less machinery than
i.nder the methods formerly in use.
Developments at the Giroux Droo-
erty will be watched with the great
est interest. Upon the results ob
tained by the 500-ton plant will no
doubt rest the company's action in re-
pi.rd to the erection of a concentrator
of a capacity in keeping with the size
or u.e property which has million nf
tons of proven ore. News that tho
company has at last made a definite
.start toward production will be re
ceded with the greatest satisfaction.

respect.
Has
I In last week's issue of the Record
.mention was made of the report that
'Pat Sheahan, a former well known
mining man of this county, had met
with a serious accident at the Lost
Packer mine In Idaho, of which he Is
superintendent. The following ac
count of the affair is taken from the
Mackey, Idaho, Miner, of the date of
August 30th:
One the evening of the 21st, at the
Lost Packer mine occurred a fright
ful accident which brouu'tt terrible
futfering to three men for a time. A
metal tank containing 528 pounds of
sulphuric acid was to be opened for
use and . Floe Clyde attempted to
screw the plug from the tank, but it
would not yield and a rap of the
hammer to loosen the plug, caused
the tank to explode, throwing the
. ,,. lime, car. sneanan,
and Mr. Thomas Worthington. Mr.
Clyde, who was the nearest to the
tank, was badly burned over all the
exposed portions of his body, and
Mr. Sheahan was burned on the face
and hands, with much injury to his
eyes, and Mr. Worthington was also
badly burned on his face.
Following the explosion what re
lief could possibly be given tha in
jured men in camp was afforded them
and Dr. Kirtley was called from Chai
ns, arriving twelve hours later and
the men Buffered very greatlv until '
his arrival. Following the visit of 1
ur. Kirtley, Dr. Hampton, an eve
specialist of Salt Lak City, was called
on account of the condition of Mr
Sh Pa tian'a airaa K ... , . .
" vj,o, vut ,u examination
proved that no lasting lnlurv wan
done and that he will recover his
sight unimpaired.
It is thought that the tank was
defective and the tap of the hammer
caused the pressure on weakened
part that gave way with such dire
results.
TOM BARRACLOUGH IS - '
IN RACE FOR JUDGESHIP
Everything is quiet in local no't.
leal circles right now and there is
likely to be "little doing" until the
county conventions meet a week
from next Tuesday which is the
19th of September. There is not a
stir anywhere and thera are a lot of
offices to be filled. To he sure then
are quite a number of candidates in
the field, as a glance of the Record s
political announcement column will
confirm. There is a conspicuous ab
sence, however, of aspirants for the
office of justice of the peace for
Pioche. A number of persons have
been mentioned for the place, for in
stance, Carl Sampson, W, E. Harri
son and others. But the latest, in
fact the first to say positively that
he .will take the Job, is none other
than Tom Barraclough. Tom has de
clared that his hat is in the ring
and that he Is willing the prefix
"Judge" should be added to his
name. Tom is well known to every
body In Pioche and no doubt has
many friends in this town who will
work to see him made judge of the
local court. Tom is a Democrat, but
says politics will cut no figure with
him if he is chosen (to be the next
Justice of the peace in Pioche; that
he will endeavor to deal out justice
fairly and Impartially to all.
