America's Greatest Women
Writers on the Train, Too.
The presence of Mrs. Harry I'ayne
Whitney, Mrs. Alice Roosevelt Long
worth, Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt,
Miss Frances Kellor, Mary Harriman
Rumsey, Mrs. Daniel Guggenheim and
Miss Maud Wetmore are the drawing
cards which are expected to secure
a large crowd when the "Flying
Sauadron" of the Women's Natlona
Hughes Alliance reaches Topeka the
latter part of September.
A telegram from these ladies, all
members of the national committee
of the Women's Hughes Alliance, was
received today by Mrs. Lilla Day
Monroe, member for Kansas of the
national committee of the alliance,
announcing "the first women's trans
continental train in the history of
politics." The train will carry, ac
cording to the dispatch. "America's
greatest women writers, speakers and
workers on social and economic ques
tions, and will carry messages of
American citizenship, nationalism,
preparedness, protection of women
and child welfare."
Promise Royal Welcome.
Mrs. Monroe wired an immediate
reply, promising a royal welcome to
the squadron. A i imittee of forty,
twenty men and twenty women, from
all parties and prominent organiza
tions, will be chosen immediately. A
special effort will be made to organize
the smaller surrounding towns. An
attempt will be made to secure a rep
resentation from every town of im
portance in this part of the state un
der a local chairman and carrying a
banner inscribed with the name of the
town. Letters will be sent to promi
nent women all over the state an
nouncing the "squadron." A gather
ing of at least 10,000 women is ex
pected. The squadron is an imitation of the
tour of the women's party envoys last
spring and is working for the same
end but the alliance train will
carry a larger and more imposing bat
tery of names of forty-two centimeter
prominence. The end that the al-li-.tce
is working for is identical with
that of the women's party only the slo
gan in one case is "Elect Hughes" and
in the other "Beat Wilson." Repre
sentatives of the women's party here
will take a prominent part in organ
izing the ovation for the alliance
squadron.
The exact date of arrival has not
been announced but It is understood
that it will be in the latter part of
the month. The moss meeting will be
addressed by at ieast three of the east
ern women and will be held in the
auditorium.
The trip will mark the first appear
ance of all of the famous members of
the national committee of the alliance.

RAYMONDTOCITY
Newton Santa Fe General. Su
perintendent to Topeka.
Selection of the Successor to R.
J. Parker Soon.
.That Edward Raymond, junior geo
eral superintendent of Santa Fe east
ern lines in Newton, will be promoted
to fill the place of R. J. Parker,
senior superintendent, who haj? been
appointed general manager of western
lines in Amarillo, was taken for
granted in Santa Fe official circles
today.
Fred C. Fox, named general mana
ger of eastern lines to succeed the late
C. W. Kouns, 19 expected to make the
appointment any time following hia
official notification or promotion
which was mailed to him from Chi
cago Thursday. The Santa Fe method
of making such promotions insures
Raymond's promotion, it is pointed
out. Raymond, under the Santa Fe
policy, is next in line for Mr. Parker's
place.
Who will succeed Mr. Raymond is
not so definite, however. Two leading
men for the place are C. H. Bristol,
general superintendent of northern
district of the western lines in La
Junta, and T. H. Sears, general super
intendent of the southern district of
western lines in Amarillo. However,
selection may be made from the gen
eral office here.
LAUTZ TOGO UP?
Report That Topekan Will Be
Made General Superintendent.
Assistant to General Manager
May Succeed E. Raymond.
It was rumored in Topeka railway
circles late this afternoon that Henry
B. Lautz, for years assistant to the
general manager of the Atchison, To
peka & Santa Fe railway in Topeka.
will be given the position of general
superintendent of the western lines,
headquarters in Newton.
If Mr. Lautz is given this position
he will succeed E. Raymond, who will
come to Topeka to succeed R. J.
Parker, who has been appointed gen
eral ihanager of the western lines fol
lowing the change of Fred Fox and
the death of C. W. Kouns.
Henry B. Lautz has been a most ef
ficient and faithful member of the
Santa Fe operating staff in Topeka
and has been recognized as a railway
authority.
TO STAVE OFF STRIKE
Miners and Operators Prolong Kansas
CHy Conference.
Kansas City, Mo., Sept. 8. After
many postponements, the joint confer
ence of operators and coal miners was
slated to be resumed today to hear
the report of disagreement from the
sub-committee.
Wednesday the miners suddenly ask
ed postponement of the meeting
which was to hear the "final'' report.
Thursday the operators unexpectedly
asked more time for consideration
when the union delegates informed
them they could not sign the proposed
contract. Some miners thought this
meant concessions would be made to
avert a strike.
Six Hurt When Autos Collide.
Chicago. Sept. 8. Four girls and
two men were seriously injured early
today when a a automobile in which
they were ridirg collided head-on with
another machine. Miss Gertrude

to have a fractured skull.

First Estimates of Increase in
Gross Revenues.
The Santa Fe is laying plans to go
into the express business. Reports,
from reliable sources, are that the
railroad will take over all business
done on its system and auxiliary lines
by Wells Fargo. Based on the earn
ings of Wells Fargo on Santa Fe lines
in the fiscal year of 1915, such a step
would add, approximately, $3,083,
229.29 to the net earnings of the rail
road. Coming on the heels of intelligence
that the Santa Fe will include in its
next budget extensive building and
construction appropriations, including
an appropriation for two additional
stories to the general offices in To
peka, the report is given additional
credence. A part of the offices neces
sary to take care of the express busi
ness would be in Topeka, with addi
tional offices in Chicago, Galveston
and La Junta.
A New Step.
Official announcement of the an
nexation of the Wells Fargo business.
if reports are true, will come in the
next few weeks, providing the nego
tiating are not sidetracked, bucn
step on the part of the Santa Fe would
be the first of its kind ever made by
an American railroad. Since the be
ginnin of the railroad industry express
companies have been given railroad
privileges by the carriers for between
50 and 55 per cent of gross earnings
of express companies.
Dividends in Kansas.
The Wells Fargo Express company,
figures obtained from the records of
M. A. Chambers, accountant for the
Kansas utilities commission, show the
Wells Fargo as the only express car
rier, operating in Kansas, paying divi
dends in 1915. More than that, the
Wells Fargo's net income stood higher
than that of the majority of the
twelve other express carriers, as the
net income of all express companies
snowed a deficit.
Gross receipts of all express com
panies operating in the United States
in 1915 totaled 144, 826,743. The ex
press carriers paid out of that $73,
507,565 for railway privileges.
Fargo's Earnings.
The gross earnings of Wells Fargo
were $38,555,664.15. Railway privi
leges amounted to $19,724,414. Net
earnings were $18,831,249.71. Revenue
from sources other than transportation
came to $734,633.25. Total earnings
were $19,565,882.96. The net Income
was $2,338,677.47.
The express company paid dividends
amounting to $1,438,044, leaving a
surplus of $900,633.47. Gross earn
ings on the Santa Fe, all lines, amount
ed to $6,785,871.20. Fifty-five per
cent, $3,702,229.29, was paid the Santa
Fe for railway privileges. Wells
Fargo's total revenue in Kansas alone
in 1915 amounted to $1,115,417.91.
When the parcel post was Inaugur
ated by the government, express earn
ings began tobogganning. However,
since that time they have been recov
ering gradually. Septembe 1, 1915,
express companies were granted a rate
hike, on class commodities, amounting
to a gross increase of 3.86 per cent.
Had that increase been added to 1915
business it would have meant a gross
earning increase of $5,000,000 for all
twelve express companies operating on
American railroads.
A material increase, due to the rate
increase and an increased volume of
business, is expected to be reported by
the companies for this fiscal year. The
report will be compiled soon.

WHAT WAS NATURE OF FELONY
Only Wife Knows and She Re-
fuses to Reveal It.
Strange Case of Affection Con
fronts Officials Here.
In the motion picture "Should a
Wife Forgive," the wife uses up sev
eral reels deciding whether or not she
will forgive, then forgives. Mrs,. C. W.
Cooper, young wife of a Des Moines
man, arrested by Hugh Larimer, un
dersheriff, didn't hesitate a minute.
Not only did she forgive but she de
manded that Larimer arrest her along
with the husband in order that she
misrht be taken back to Des Moines
with him.
Just what crime is charged against
Cooper has not been made known to
local officers but a telegram states It
is a felony. He was arrested at the
Union Pacific station by Hugh Larimer
when he called there for his baggage.
Larimer was sitting upon it with a
telegram in his hand instructing him
to arrest Cooper.
Mrs. Cooper was astonished when
the arrest was made. Cooper looked
and acted like a sick man but he
was not surprised. He appeared to
half expect it. He was taken to the
county jail. Mrs. Cooper accompan
ied him and talked with him quietly
on the way. He told her what trouble
he had left in Des Moines.
Wanted to Be Arrested
She didn't bring up the question of
forgiveness. Instead, she encouraged
her husband and begged that she be
arrested so she could be in the same
jail with him and return to Iowa with
him. Larimer agreed to do what he
could for her but refused to promise.
Mrs. Cooper obtained a room near
the jail and began trying to sell a
small diamond ring she wore. She
wanted the money to use for a ticket
when the Iowa officers should come
for her husband. She couldn't sell
the ring for enough money and even
ually she telegraphed, to her peoplV.
and they furnished the necessary
money.
Last night she started back to Des
Moines, to take up with the author
ities, the charge against her husband.
Cooper is still in the county jail, but
officers are expected from Des Moinej
Saturday.

IRON GATE OF HUNGARY FALLS

French Make Gain in Terrific
Onslaught at Verdun.
London, Sept. 8. The beginning of
a great battle in southeastern Ru
mania is reported unofficially from
Petrograd. The Russians are said to
have taken the offensive over the en
tire Dobrudja front, attacking the in
vading Bulgarians and Germans from
the Danube to the Elack sea.
An undated Bulgarian official report
announces important victories for the
invaders in this region. It is said the
German and Bulgarian forces have
captured the fortified town of Dobric 1
or Bazardjk, fifty miles southeast of
Bucharest, and three towns on the Ru
manian Black sea coast near the Bul
garian frontier.
Sofia concedes the Rumanians have
occupied the important Hungarian
town of Orsova, capture of which has
previously been reported unofficially.
The official Petrograd report of to
day indicates that the Russians have
embarked on an important enterprise
on the northern end of their front.
On the front below Lemberg, in
eastern Galicia, a further retreat by
the Austro-German forces is reported
by the Russian war office. They are
said to have fallen back to the western
bank of the Gnita Li pa, the last river
before Lemberg to the south which is
available for defensive purposes.
Rumanians Capture Orsova.
London, Sept. S. A Bucharest dis
patch today reported that the Ruman
ians have occupied Orsova at the iron
gate to Hungary. The occupation of
Orsova has been reported from several
sources recently, but the reports thus
far have not been confirmed by the
Rumanian war office.
- Oiwva is one of the .principal ports
on the lower Danube and has ennain-
erable commercial importance. It is
a few miles above the Iron gate of the
Danube, where the river leaves Hun
gary and forms the boundary between
Rumania and northeastern Serbia.
Lose Trench to French
Berlin. Sept. 8. The Germans have
lst trench sections to the French in
fighting south of the Somme, west of
Berny and also northeast of Souville,
on the Verdun front, it was officially
admitted this afternoon.
Paris. Sept. 8. Four attacks in
dense formation were launched by the
Germans south of the Somme last
night between Vermandovillers and
Chaulnes. None of the attacks succeed
ed in reaching any French positions
and the French took 200 more prison
ers. The Germans attacked heavily
against new French positions between
Berny and a point south of Chaulnes,
suffering heavy losses.
The French made further progress
on the Verdun front last night by
grenade attacks. A German attack at
Vaux Chapitre where the French
made a most successful drive Wednes
day night, was repulsed.

Three Months' Drive.
RUSSIA'S SACRIFICE GREATEST
Germans Believe Danger of Se
rious Reverses Passed.
Teutons Wild With Joy Over
Fall of Tutrakan.
Berlin, Sept. 8. The allies have lost
more than a million men in killed,
wounded and missing since the grand
offensive against the central powers
opened with a Russian attack three
months ago. This estimate was made
today by German military experts who
said they thought it conservative.
Against these losses, the allied arm
ies have only the conquest of Buko
wina and some Galician territory by
the Russians, the capture of Goritz by !
the Italians, a shallow thrust into the
German lines on the Somme and the
occupation of mountainous Transyl
vanian territory by the Rumanians as
positive military achievements.
Central Powers' Lines Intact.
The armies of the central powers,
keeping their lines intact everywhere
under tremendous pressure at the
same time struck back with success
ful blows in the Balkans. The Bul
garians advanced on both flanks to
positions menacing the allies in Greece.
German and Bulgarian forces struck
a severe blow against the Rumanians
by occupying Tutrakan fortress, one
of the bridgehead positions defending
Bucharest.
-The losses of the allies, as conserva
tively estimated here, follow:
Russian, 600,000.
British, 230,000.
French 150,000.
Italian, Serbian and Rumanian com
bined, 60,000.
Some Austrian experts and a num
ber of Germans have estimated the
Russian losses at more than 800,000
and the combined British and French
losses at-more than 400,000. Official
casualty lists given out at London show
British losses of about 125,000 for the
month of August alone.
Will Cry for Peace.
The danger of any serious reverse
on either the western or eastern fronts
is believed to have passed. But any
additional gains, it is held here, must
be made at such a frightful additional
cost to human lives and with such an
extravagant waste of munitions that
the people of the allied countries will
cry for peace.
News of the capture of Tutrakan
fortress and the surrender of 20,000
Rumanians aroused more enthusiasm
here than even the military import
ance of the victory justified. Next to
an invasion of England no movement
would .be more popular here than a
drive northward to the capital of Ru
mania because of the universal opin
ion that the Rumanians treacherously
deserted their allies in declaring war.
CURTIS AIRS PLOT

of Foreign Lobby.
Canada Opposed U. S. Fish Em
bargo, Is Charge.
Washington, Sept. 8. Demand for
an investigation of charges that a
lobby was conducted by officials of
the Canadian government against a
revenue bill amendment which would
have prohibited admission of halibut t
or salmon from the North Pacific into
the United States except in bond from
an American port, was made in a
senate resolution today by Senator
Curtis of Kansas.
The resolution by Senator Curtis
directing the senate lobby committee
to investigate the activities of the al
leged foreign lobby opposing retalia
tory provisions of the revenue bill
against Canadian fisheries, was passed
today by the senate.
Wants Jap Demands Probed, Too.
Senator Reed, Democrat, a member
of the lobby committee said he
believed it was high time for the
American government to show other
nations that it regarded as offensive
any efforts to Influence legislation in
congress.
Senator Lewis, Democrat, urged that
if anything should be investigated it
should be the recent demands of Japan
on China H declared that apparently
they were in retaliation to the attitude
of this country toward admission of
the Japanese. Russia, he said, was a
party with Japan and sought retalia
tion because of the abrogation of the
American commercial treaty.
The resolution was adopted after the
senate had disposed of a similar res-
I olution by referring it to a committee.
I he new resolution adopted provides
for a report at the next session of
congress.
Foreign Influence in Elections.
Washington, Sept. 8. Just before

Gardner of Massachusetts, introduced
a resolution which, h c n n m i moH V, a
would press at the winter session for !
congressional investigation of organi
zations which, it is alleged, under for
eign influence have attempted to af
fect elections of congress.
In a Matement accompanying his

it was commonly understood that one !
of these pro-German organizations has

Dwiht Dilworth, well-to-do attorney
of Montclair, N. J., in Van Courtlandt

Find Eye Witnesses of Shooting.
Shortly before midnight last night,
Miss Mary McNiff, the young woman
companion of Dilworth on his fatal
ride into the park, was summoned to
the district attorney's office. She was
again questioned by Assistant District
Attorney Quigley and detectives.
Then the attention of the authorities
was turned to the newly-discovered
witness. These witnesses are a young
man and young woman, who told
Quigley they were in the park near
the scene of the shooting when Dil
worth was killed.
An anonymous letter from another
woman gave the police their first clue.
This letter told of the woman having
heard the witness, who was ques

The writer of the letter was first
found and questioned. Then the
young woman she named was brought
to the King's Bridge station and
finally her companion. The young
woman at first denied knowledge of
the shooting, but confronted by the
original informant of the authorities,
she is said to have admitted witness
ing the killing.
The revolver from which the fatal
shots were fired was held by a woman,
she said.
