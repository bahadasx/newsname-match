FEATURES OF REVENUE
BILL AS IT FINALLY
; 7 PASSED .DOTH HOUSES
- WASHINGTON. D, C, SepL 8.
Late last night the house adopted by
a viva voce vote the new revenue bill
which carries th retaliation'! amend
menta to provide protection for Unit
ed States trade against Interference
bv the Allies.- The conference com
mittee arter being In a deadlock for
'? twenty-four hours, finally reached an
agreement alter a number of extreme
ly radical features of the measure had
.- been. toned down. - ' .
The bill aa It finally passed both the
Tipper and lower house retains the pro-
- vision reducing, the minimum of ln
comes subject to taxation to $3000 for
unmarried men and 34000 for married
: men. This feature Of the new bill was
. Injected In order to raise the revenue
from this source, as the previous in
s come tax set the minimum at $3500 for
single men and $4500 for 'married men.
This feature of the measure waa pass
ed only arter aerloua objection by
members ef both housen. '
No change has been made in the in
heritance tax in the new bill and the
same schedule of taxes on beer, wines,
liquors, theaters and houses of amuse
ment will remain as before.
V Munition Tax Boosted. - " , '
One of the most radical features of
' 'the new till Is the Increase in the tax
Y oa the net profit on all munition manu
. factured. Under the new schedule this
tav has been Talsed to twelve and one
half per cent. The tax on all corpora
tion stock haa been " raised to fifty
cents for each $1000 of capital stock
paid in, despite strenuous opposition
made to this section of .the bill.- All
stamp and copper refining taxes Lave
v been eliminated in the new bllL
" One of the jokers of the new na
- tional measure is the retaining of the
'tariff commission without any appro
priation for paying the members of
"the commission. Originally the mem
bers of the con mission received a sal
ary of $10,0CD yearly. Later this was
reduced to $7500. Under the new law
members of the commission will find

do not carry any salary. ;-:r;"
