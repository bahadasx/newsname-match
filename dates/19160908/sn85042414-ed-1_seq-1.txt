son the fierce struggle going on for

Micheler's forces, which reached the
railroad running from Roye to
Peronne and hold It for a distance of
two and a half miles, with the result
that the German line of communica

APPROPRIATIONS IN HISTORY OF
COUNTRY, FINISHED WORK TODAY
Four Important Treaties
Ratified—Many Big
Measures Passed.
Washington, Sept. 8.—The first ses
sion of the sixty-fourth congress
which adjourned today was concerned
chiefly with national defense.
When the gavel fell congress had
directed reorganization and reequlp
ment of the army and navy for de
fense of the country at the unpre
cedented cost of $655,000,000 with au
thorizations that will increase the to
tal in three years to nearly $800,000,
000. With all other expenditures, ap
propriations were brought to the
grand total of $1,687,588,882, the
greatest aggregate in the country's
history and exceeding that for the last
fiscal year by more than half a bil
lion dollars
Expenditures, necessitated by pre
paredness and the calling into action
of military forces to meet the Mexi
can emergency demanded revenue leg
islation in the closing days of the ses
sion. Congress responded by doubling
the normal tax on incomes, creating
an Inheritance tax, munitions tax and
miscellaneous excise taxes to raise
$205,000,000 and by directing sale of
$130,000,0|0 Panama canal bonds.
Congress established a tariff com
mission a government shipping
board to rehabilitate the American
merchant marine a workmen's com
pensation commission to administer a
new uniform compensation law a
farm loan banking system a child
labor law enlarged the system of
self-government i/i the Philippines
and enacted many other important
laws which had been contemplated
by the administration.
The session was disturbed through
out by frequently recurring threats of
foreign complications from the Euro
pean war and imminent at one time
of a diplomatic break with Germany
Interference with American mails
and commerce, invasion of American
soil and killing of Americans by Mex
ican bandits, and danger of actual
war with Mexico.
The crisis In congress over the in
ter
hat
ion
al situation followed Ger
many's naval order to sink armed bel
ligerent merohant ships without warn
ing. Introduction of resolutions
warning Americans to keep off armed
merchantmen caused President Wil
son to halt diplomatic negotiations
and go to the capltol to demand a
"showdown." The result was tabling

Although he had satisfied himself
that Crocker Land did not exist, Mac
Mlllan was not ready to return home
ward, but Instead elected to make a
particularly dangerous journey across
the Ice to Flnlay Land, 1,600 miles
away.
For many months nothing was
heard from MacMlllan and in July,
1916, the schooner George B. Cluett,
which had been chartered from the
Grenfell association by the Crocker
Land committee, left 8t. Johns, New
Foundland, for Etah, Greenland, in
charge of E, H- Hovey, to relieve and
bring back the members of the ex
pedition.
As a result of unusually severe ice
conditions on the coast of Greenland

Cluett was compelled to spend the
winter In Parker Snow Bay, 150 miles

proceed to Etah. Greenland, to the re
lief of the members of the Crocker
Land expedition and to land them
