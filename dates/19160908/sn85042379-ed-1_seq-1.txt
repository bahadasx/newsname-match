COUNTY FAIR

,, _
The Fifth annual Valley County
. . , |
rair opened in this city yesterday
. , . , , ,
morning. The weather was ideal and
a goodly crowd took advantage of the
opportunity to take in Northern Mon
tana s greatest fair. ,
Secretary Moore advises us that the
exhibits this year, when they are all t
in, will far surpass any previous year |
and that already many record break-,
ing exhibits are one display. ^
The entries for the dairy herd con-j
test are worthy of special mention at
this time. Five herds have been en- !
tered ,each and every one of them,:
among the finest in the land. • j
While the crowds yesterday were
not large all in attendance were en
thusiastic and record breaking at
tendances are looked forward to for
today and tomorrow.
The free attractions are excellent.
the chief regret of the fair manage- j
ment being the fact that Otto W.
1 1 mm, the birdman, was unable to
fil! his contract here owing to a smash
up at the Iowa State l'air a tew days j
ago. Up until late Wednesday it
was thought that he would be ablej
to be present and fill his engagement,
but at a late hour Wednesday evening,
Mr. Timm wired that it would be
impossible for him to get heie. j
The races this year promise to be |
the best ever witnessed at a \ alley j
County Fair, as some of the best hors-;
es in the state are entered. It is safe |
to s ay that no fair in the state will i
offer a better racing card thna the one
offer a better racing card than the one
ty fair.
KILLED BY MOVING TRAIN
Last Saturday evening Frank Wil
son, supposed to be from Pittsburgh,
Pa., was 1 adly mangled neai the depot j
at Bainvilie while attempting to steal |
a ride < î : a fn ight train that vas just |

the county patients, and Dr. Munch
was called.
Dr. Munch found the man still un
conscious with one arm mashed off
Millions of Acres Public
Lands Are Still Open
There are 16,649,725 acres of sur
veyed and unsurveyed government
lands in Montana today, a large pro
portion of which is of such charac
ter as to be suitable for settlement
by home builders. But if the rate
at which this government land was
taken in the year ending July 1 last
continues for five years at the end
of that time there will be none. The
total open for settlement now is
3,000,000 acres less than it was on
July 1, 1915.
Dawson county contains the larg
est body of government lanl, 2,085,
974 acres. Other counties within
whose borders there is more than
a million acres of unappropriated
land are Beaverhead with 1,129,561
acres, Custer with 1,323,840, Fallon
with 1,293,280, Phillips with 1,896,
964 and Valley with 1,516,188.
The county having the smallest
amount is Ravalli, with 3,461, while
Lincoln has only 4,270 acres.
The total in the different counties,!
surveyed and unsurveyed is as fol

AFTER NORMAL SCHOOL
At the meeting of the directors of
the Glasgow Commercial Club held in
the Club rooms on Friday evening
there was a discussion relative to the
securing of a normal school in Glas
ijow. It was the general opinion,
that owing to the need of such an'
institution, and to the distance pupils
have to go from this section to at- j
tend a normal, that it is possible such
a school could be secûred.
The large attendance at the sum
mer school and the numerous demands
for that class of education seems to
indicate that it will soon become a
necessity. Condition and facilities
for supporting a normal school that
Glasgow offers, show that it would
be well attended and successful. |
Efforts will be made to have a bill
put through at the coming session
of the legislature for an appropriation 1
lor a normal here.

HOLDUP AT CULBERTSON
About 9:45 o'clock last night a short
thick-set man entered Frank Steph
en's saloon by the back entrance. He
had a blue dotted handkerchief over
his face and a six shooter in his hand.
1 here were six men in front of the
j bar including Geo. Graham, a;id two
companions from Poplar, Clarence
Donohoe, Chas. Clark and an employe
; ot mie of the local lumber yards.
Stephens was behind the bar.
! " Ilands u i ,M sa y s the bandit, and
j the hands went up. He lined the men
in front of the bar against the wall
faces to the wall, and proceeded to
secure the mazuma. He started down
the line and robbed a couple of the
men, then thought better of it and
j turned his, attention to Frank Steph-'
Jens. While Frank had his hands in
j the air looking into the muzzle of the
gun, the robber reached into his pock-;
et and secured a roll of $160 in bills,
I overlooking a roll in the other pocket
of $100. He then robbed the cash
register of about $40.
While this was going on a lad nam
! eH ' Thomas Hamilton stepped into the
j front door. He was held up at the
door, but finally beat it down to the
Plaace Saloon and gave the alarm.
About this time the bandit left by
the back door, firing two shots as
he left the saloon.
In a few moments guns were se
cured and several men, including
Marshall Cary, were on the hunt but
the bandit had made his get-a-way.
Th«_> bandit was recognized as a
men who had been around town for
several days named Emil Fredgez.
The sheriff was notified and Deputy
W. Matthews arrived here early this
morning. The hunt is still on and
neighboring towns have been notified.
Il is not thought possible that the
robber can avoid arrest within a day
or two.—Culbertson Searchlight.

officers for the ensuing two years.
Practically every precinct in the coun
ty was represented at the meeting.
E. D. Button of Glasgow was unani

SHERIFF BUYS HOME
A deal was consummated this week
whereby C. W. (Puck) Powell takes
over the J. P. Mclntyre residence on
Fourtn Avenue South. Mr. Mc Intyre
has rente! apartments in the newf
Rund! ■ building where he will move
his family as soon as the building is
'•ompleted. The purchase of the Mc
tyre resuler.ee gives Sheriff Powell
one of the pret.iest homes in the city.
A large number of people from the
neighboring towns are attending the
fair.
and are considered the best along
the border. The dining rooms have
been screened and the boys are now
building sleeping houses for win
ter.
Corporal Sloan of company L stated
that the camp now is in first class
shape, the militiamen working over
two months 011 improving camping
conditions. The Second Montana,
Sloan said, is reputed to have the
cleanest and most up-to-date camp on
the border. The Montana regiment
is the only militia organization as
signed to outpost dcty.
Whether college students in the
militia are to return in time to en
ter the educational institutions this
month is creating considerable com
ment on the border, the returning
officers said. There are about 50
college men in the Montana regiment
and most of these are desirous of get
ting back to school. The Montana
regiment now is 600 below the desired
quota and commanding officers want
to keep the ranks as full as possible.
On several occasions the college men,
it is said, have applied for their dis
charges and transportation home, but
this far nothing has been done.
