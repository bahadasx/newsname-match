ments that (iemande I auiek remedies

bility that came to him.
Only Ma!(.M,:enship of the loftiest
type, only most 1 xt rnordlnary genius
for the grasp of affairs could have
saved it from disaster and put this
country in its 1 p"--ent commanding
position.
No mariner ever invaded a doubt
ful sea with more perplexities than
President Wilson has been called on
to nipet, to grapple with and to solve.
Through it all, he has followed the
one unconquerable course to do the
right to all concerned, in the right
way.
"I shall seel, as I have always
soupht,''' he declared, renewing the
past and outlining his future poli
cies, to justify the extraordinary
confidence reposed in me by striv
ing to purge my heart and purpose
of every personal and of every mis
leading party motive and devoting
every energy I have to the service
of the nation as a whole, praying
that I may continue to have the
counsel and support of all forward
looking men at every turn of the
diIicult business."
To condense any lengthy utterance
of the President is dillicult. Every
thing he says is full of pith and di
rectly to the point.
He recounted In his address the ac
hievements of his administration
Not boastfully, because "boasting is
always an empty business, which
pleases nobody but the boaster."
The Democratic party, he insisted,
has merely done its duty. "It has
merely fulfilled its explicit promises."
Digressing, he said: "The Re
publican party was put put of pow
er because of failure, practical fail
ure and moral failure; because it
has served special interests and not
the country at large; because un
der the leadership of its preferred
and established guides, of those
who still niaktj its choices, it had
lost touch with the thoughts and
needs of the nation and was living
in a .past age and under a fixed
illusion, the illusion of greatness."
Recounting briefly the failures of
tho Republican party, he summarized
Democratic achievement: "Alike in
this domestic field and in the wide
field of the commerce of the world,
American business and life and In
dustry have been set free to move as
they never moved before."
The tariff has been revised, he ex
plained, not on the principal of re
pelling foreign trade but upon the
principle of encouraging it.
"The laws against trusts have
been clarified by definition, with a
view to making It plain that they
were not directed against big busi
ness, but only against unfair busi
news and the pretense of competi
tion." The supply of cin'-ency has by the
Federal Reserve act oeen rendered
elastic; commercial credit has been
created for the farmers of the country
and they now have the standing of
of the business men in the money
market; the woikingmen of America
have been given vertlble emancipa
tion by the legal recognition of 11
man's labor as part of his life and
not a mere marketable commodity;
the emancipation of the children of
the country has been effected by re
leasing them from hurtful labor.
In concise form he explained the
enael ment of complete preparedness.
The lobby hus been driven from
cover and forced to "substitute solid
hi KUiiieiils for private inlliinnce."
Speaking of the contingencies of
the near future, ho said: "The Re
publican party is Just the party that
cannot meet the contingencies of a
new ago." Squarely meeting the ar
gument of his rlvul for the Presidency
he declared:
"It does not know the way, and
it does not wish new conditions.
It tried to break away from the old
lenders and It could not. They
f.tlll select Its candidates and dic
tate Its policy, still resist change,
si ill banker after the old conditions
still know no methods of encour
aging business but the old methods."
Peace abroad "will have to build
its house anew", and he pleaded for a
reservation of our strength and our
resources for the anxious and dillicult
days of restoration and healing which
must follow.
Denouncing fortign-born Intriguers
In this country, he naid: "I neither
seek the favor nor fear the displeas
ure of that small alien element among
us which puis loyally to any foreign
power before loyalty to the United
States."
Addressing himself to the Mexican
situation, the President said:
"There are men, and noble wo
men too, not a few of our people,
thank God, whose fortunes are in
vested in great properties in Mexi
co, who yet see the case with true
vision and arrest Its issues with
true American feeling .... No per
manency can be given the affairs
of any republic by a title based up
on intrigue and assassination. I
declared that to be the policy of
this administration within three
weeks after I assumed the Presi
dency. I here again vow it. I am
more interested in the fortunes of
oppressed men and pitiful women
and children than ir- any property
rights whatever."
Problems of the future were dwelt
upon. Peace will not bring us into
their presence slowly, gently, with
eremonious introduction, hut sud
denly and at once the moment the
war in Europe is over.. We must
be ready to mobilize our resources
iliko of brains and of materials.
It is not a future to be afraid of. It
is, rather, a future to stimulate and
excite us to the display of the best
powers that are in us."
This country's insular possessions
ere discussed frankly and from
what has come to be known as tin-
American view point.
And then at home we must see to
it that the men who plan and direct
our business enterprises shall enjoy
eiinite and settled conditions of law
a policy accommodated to the freest
progress. .. .We have put all kinds
of unfair competition under the ban
nd penalty of the law. We have
aired monopoly."
s to labor!
"We must hearten and quicken
the spirit and etllclency of labor
throughout our whole industrial
system everywhere and in all occu
pations doing justice to the laborer
.And we must do more than
justice. We must safeguard life
and promote health and safety In
every occupation in which they are
threatened or imperilled. That Is
more than justice, and better be
cause it is humanity and justice."
lie took in everything that has kin
ship even to an issue amongst the
people. Nothing omitted, nothing
extenuated, he covered the entire do
main of political variance.
In the amplitude ol his discussion
nothing was overlooked.
Frank and confident, there was no
evasion, no subterfuge, no hiding be
hind words. He told the administra
tion's whole story, told it mo;lestly
nd convincingly.
We are'Amerisins for big Amer
ica, he said in his peroration,
ind rejoice to look forward to the
days in which America shall strive
to stir the world without irritating
it or drawing it on to new antag
onisms, when the nations with
which we deal shall at last come
to see upon what deep foundations
of humanity and justice our pas
sion for peace rests."
