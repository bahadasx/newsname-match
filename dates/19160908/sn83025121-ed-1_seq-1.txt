New Bill For Protection o Amer
ican Commerce and Industry
Against Dumping of Goods On
This Market By Europeans
' VI
(Assoeisted Frees by Federal WiniMi.)
WASHINGTON, September sWLate
last night the house adopted by a viva
voce vote the new revenue bill which
carries the "retaliation' amendment!
to provide protection for TJnited Stated
trade against interference, by the Al
lien. The conference committee after
being in a deadlock for twenty-four
bourn, finally reached an agreement af
ter a number of extremely radical feu
tnres of the measure had been toned
down.
The bill a it finally panned both the
tipper anil lower house retain! the pro
vision reducing the minimum of In
comes subject to taxation te 3000 io
unmarried men and 4000 for married
men. This feature of the new bill was
injected in order to raise the revenue
from this source, as the previous in
come tax set the minimum at 3500 for
single' roes, and fsfiOQ for, married teen.
This f sat ore of the measure waa pass
ed only after serious objection by mem
bers of both booses.
Inheritance Tat Stands
- No Chang be been made' In- the In
heritance tat1n"tiie nsw bill and - the
same schtdule of tsxes.6a.beev wince,
li)aort, theaters and kmisea ef amasu
ment will remain h before. '
One of the most radloal features o
the new bill is the increase In the ta4
on the net profit on all monition manu
factured. Under the new schedule this
tax has been raised to twelve and one
half per rtnt. The tax on al corpora
tion stork has been raised to fifty
cents fur each flOOO of capital stock
paid in, despite strenuous oppositioa
made to this seekion of the bill. All
stHinp and poppet rc-Qning taxes have
bern eliminated in the new bill.
One nf the Jokers of the new na
tional measure is the retaining of the
tari.fr commission without any appro
priation f:r paying the members of the
coniiniNoion. Originally the members
of the cotninissioii received a salary of
10.IMKI yearly. Later this was reduced
to t7r00. t iider the now law members
of tbe romniiNxion will find themselves
ocitupyinn positions that do not carry
any salury.
Protect American Trade
In order to protect American indus
tries ngniiiHt any possible trade war
following the European war the bill
curries what is popularly known as the
"antidumping'' provision. I'nder
this provision foreign nations will find
It uni.rolltnl.le to ship goods to the
I'riited Ntutea at a loss in order to
compete with and drive out of the mar
ket goods of Amorican manufacture
that cannot be produced at the same
low figure that they are produced in
Kurope. -
Another provision in the new' bill
that will give au impetus to the de
velopment of the chemical induiitry in'
the I'nited Htates is the Increased duty
on all dycstuffs manufactured in for
eign countries. With the beginning of
the Kuropean war tbo t'nited States
wax confronted with a serloas problem
by a threatened shortage of dyestuffs.
The price of these materials has
reached u tigure never dreamed of be
fore. I'nder the provisions of the
new schedule American manufacturers
of dyetunM will be enabled to compete
with Kuropean manufacturers.
Raliatlm Provisions
Probably the most drastic feature of
the new bill is the new famous "re
taliation" cluuse. This section of the
net has been the cause of endless de
bate in both houses of congress and as
it finally came from the committee
conference it is a complete triumph
for the administration.
I'nder this provision the President
is given power to authorize officers at
nil portie to refuse clearance papers to
foreign-owned vessels which seek to
discriminate against any American
manufactured goods. The bill eci Ac
idly Mutes that clearance 1h to be re
fused to ull ships whii'b refuse to take
shipments of American made goods for
liny ol her reusou than laek of cargo
space.
Following the passage of the revenue
bill a resolution was phased by both
branches of congress to adjourn the
