DEPARTED
Friend after friend departs:
Who hath not lost a friend?
There is no union here of hearts
That finds not here an end:
Were this frail world our final
rest,
Living or dying, none were blest.
There is a World above,
Where parting is unknown:
A long eternity of love,
Formed for the good alone;
And faithbeholds the dying here
Translated to that glorious
Sphere.
Thus star by star declined,
Till all aro passed away;
As morning high and higher
shines
To pure and perfect day;
Nor sink those stars in empty
nignt,
But hide themselves in heaven
own light.
