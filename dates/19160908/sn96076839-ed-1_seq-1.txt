Wholesalers
To Visit Us
Grand Rapids Business Men on:
V Trade Tour
Will Spend One Night at East
Jordan Last Week in Sept.
The eleventh annual trade extension
tour of the Grand Rapids Association of
Commerce will be held Sept. 20-29,
when one hundred representatives of
the wholesale houses of that city will
go north over the CI. R. & I. road to
Mackinaw City and south to Grayling
over the M. C, and to several points on
the east and west lines in the northern
part of the state. The party will travel
in and live on its private train of seven
coaches and two diners and will be ac
companied by the Furniture City band
of 20 pieces.
Stops will be made at 45 towns, where
the wholesalers will call on their busi
ness friends, not with order book in
hand but to bind closer the ties of
friendship which have been close for
i years. Night stops will be made
at Cadillac, East Jordan, Petoskey and
Grayling, and special programs will be
giyVuT The band will give a concert at
every stop during the four days.
This same trip was taken by the same
party seven years ago and has ever
since been regarded as the banner trip
of the wholesalers. All who are going
to take the trip are looking forward to
it with great pleasure. Next week the
itinerary wiil be given with more of
the details. This place is one of those
favored by the wholesalers in the se
lection of the route.
CAN WE AFFORD
NOT TO BUILD
CONCRETE ROADS?
Wayne County, Michigan, where
auto traffic isxecedingly heavy, spend
about thirty dollars per mile to main
tain the surface of its 0110 hundred and
twenty-eight miles of concrete road and
some of these roads have been built
seven years. 1 his is more than has
been spent on Dixon Avenue and this
concrete road has been down five years.
On the piece o road opposite the Elston
House at the South end or Bridge street
not one dollar has been spent and it has
been down seven years.
Now, what is the answer or the re
minder or tlu repiy tj make to the
man who says we cannot afford con
crete ro jds? The fact is, we can't
afford anything else. Do you know
what the upkeep oT a nine foot road,
such as is being built between Green
sky Hill and Boyne City, will be? Go
and look :.t it and sre for you; self a, ul
then judge. Nobody has to be told that
in a few, very few years this road will I
have to be rebuilt and it is not the fault
of the commissioner, either. It is the
fault of the State of Michigan to allow !
their money to be spent in this unbusi
nesslike manner. .It is a fair sample;
and compares favorably with what the J
State did five years ago in sending a'
lot of six dollar a day men to do filteen
million dollars worth of business. I
mean by this, to reassess the property
that they did not know a d n thing
about. All they did know was that if
they did not add to what the local
supervisor or assessor had assessed it
at they would lose their jobs, so, of
course, they added to it. Since then,
our own assessors have continued to
let the assessment remain at the same
old highway robbery rate. Of course,
the reason is because we need the
money. Now, everybody ought to pay
a good, straight, square tax, all on the
same basis and at a fair valuation, be
cause you can't keep up a town or city
without money. I can only speak for
myself so far as Charlevoix is concern
ed. We get back a great, big percent
age for what we pay and our local im
provements show this, so, for my part,
I don't care what tax I pay if we con
tinue toCj't it back in improvements
and that is why I am fighting against
building any more macadam roads,
except it may be short ones where
only a half a dozen farmers may live
in order to give them a good road to
connect with the main concrete road
and I am fighting for this concrete road
because I want to reduce my road tax.
Let's adopt the slogan of the Detroit
Btvd of Commerce, "Build the Main
tenance into the Road, A Policy that
Satisfies the Man Who Foots the Bills."

COMING TO THE
TEMPLE THEATRE
Robert Sherman, the Chicago The
atrical Producer, is fast forging to the
front. When the present theatrical
season opened, he was one of the few
producers in the West with the courage
to launch more than one show. Mr.
Sherman produced several and his
efforts have been crowned with success
His latest Production is "The Girl With
out a Chance", the great white slave
play which comes to the Temple Thea
tre for one night, Tuesday, Sept. 10th.
This play is from the pen of an un
known author but Mr. Sherman had
read it. He saw the great pleasing
qualities of the story. He saw the
wonderful moral lesson it carried, and
with the courage typical of the Western
er, he launched it with a splendid
scenic equipment, and it has proven
successful even beyond his most
sanguine hopes. In every city where
this play has been seen, the press has
been enthusiastic in its praise. White
Slave societies throughout the country
have endorced it and today it is one of
the few real successes of the year.

Success of Thirty-Second Annual Exhibit Is
Already Assured.
Three Aeroplane Flights Today
Aviator Clouse Gave Fine Exhibit Thursday
Afternoon.
As The Herald goes to press, the Thirty-Second
Annual exhibit of (he Charlevoix County Fair is in full
progress, and everything points to the Fair being a success
in every detail. And this in the face of the fact that a
fine drizzling rain fell most of Thursday which is
always considered the big day.
The exhibits as a whole arc up to standard and in
many instances excelling those of previous years.
All the attractions scheduled arc fitting in their
parts to make a day's good program. The horse races
arc excellent and a number of good race horses arc
entered. The bands and other free attractions arc mak
ing good and the aeroplane flight of Aviator Clouse on
Thursday afternoon was worth several times the price of
admission. lie plans to give three flights today (Friday)
at about 11:00 a. m. 2:00 and 4:00 p. m.

Why Orchestras Tunc-up
Why," asked a visitor to the theater
the other day, "do members of the
orchestra always worry people possess
ing nerves, like myself, by tuning up
their instruments?"
It is all a matter of thermometer ac
cording to a musician. The temperature
in different parts of the building is
different, and the instruments have to
be tuned in the temperature of the
place in which they are going to be
playea. As a rule, the air in the theatre
becomes warmer as the performance
progresses, and so the instruments have
to be tuned several times.

School Commissioner's
Notes
May L. Stewart, Commissioner
SCHOOL CREDIT
FOR HOME WORK
New System Introduced In The
Rural Schools Of Our County1.
For a long time we have preached
that there is dignity in lab6r. We have
said that hand work, the ability to do
is noble. We have said that man is
educated so that he can do more work
in less time than he could before, that
if he does not know how to work, his
education has proved a failure. In
spite of these worthy beliefs and state
ments, we have poured book know--ledge
into the head of every child, and '
have failed to connect this book know
ledge with the daily work of the home.
We hava preached co-operation but ex
cept in emergency cases, we have de
pended largely on theory. There is a
wide difference between theory aid
practice but we are glad that there has
been a constant effort to draw them
closer together. .
This effort is the purpose of the new
system of School Credit for Home Work.
It is proposed this school year to give
every school child in the rural and
graded districts a card called "Parent's
Monthly Report to the Teacher" of
work done at home. On this card there
is a list of ordinary home tasks with
the number of credits to be given for
each, such as: "Washing and Wiping
Dishes," one credit, "Making an entire
batch of bread," five credits, "Curry
ing a horse," two credits. The parent
keeps track in whatever way is con
venient during the week, but writes on
the card the total for each week, and at
the end of the month returns the card
to the teacher. When a child has earn
ed 125 credits he is given a Home Work
Certificate. For four Home Work
Certificates, 500 credits, a child in any
of the first four grades may receive a
Diploma of Honor for Home Work.
Boys and girls in the fifth, sixth,
seventh and eighth grades may receive
this diploma for eight certificates or
1000 credits. Every boy or girl attend
ing school must own one of these
Diplomas of Honor for Home Work be
fore he or she can receive a promotion
card at the end of the school year. Any
pupil seriously ill during the year may
receive permission to catch up the
Home Credit Work during the vacation
and be passed on condition until that
work is made up.
This system is in operation and work- :
ing successfully in many parts of North ;
Dakota and Iowa. It has proved very ,
effective in Todd County,. Minnesota, ,
and comes to us highly recommended
by the parents of every community
where it has been tried. Every plan
has its good and bad points, and the
commissioner will want to hear how '
the plan is working out in your district.
A great deal will depend on the teacher,
as well as the parent, but we feel that
this system will do away with the
teacher's praise for the bright child
who learns without effort and works
neither at home nor at school, that it
will also do away with discouraging the
patient plodder, who knows more about
work than any of his schoolmates and
who is sometime going to get there.
We feel that the teacher will under
stand to a fuller extent the outside
interests of the child and will get a
fuller broader view of his education,
that the parents will realize that the
school stands for the home, thus work
ing in every way with the borne and
the work of the home.
The success of the plan will depend
largely on the enthusiasm with which
the parents meet- this system and tie
willingness and honesty with which
they make their reports. No credit
should be given for any work that is
not done cheerfully and well. If there
is any part of the card not clear the
teacher should be glad to explain. The
teacher and the parent may together
weld this new link between the hone
and the school. ,.
