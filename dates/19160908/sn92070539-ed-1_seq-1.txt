Greetings From Second Massachusetts
Under a heading "Greeting New Mexico," The Second
Regiment Sentinel says :
WHILE we naturally think there is no state like Massa
chusetts, our welcome to New Mexico hus made us
warm boosters for the newest state in the Uniou. We realize
that the border is not the most beautiful part of the state,
and after a side trip to Demiug we are anxious to visit the
other sections of your state. We bring the best wishes of the
old Bay State to New Mexico; and we will take back a high
opinion and good word for the border commonwealth.
TO THE PEOPLE OF COLUMBUS
If your esteem of the Massachusetts soldiers is as high as
ours is of you, nothing more complimentary can be written.
The Sentinel greets you !
On Account of Muddy Roads
Chas. Heath, member of the
Luna County Road Board, did t ot
attend the meeting which was
scheduled for the board at Dem
ing Monday evening. He intend
ed to go up Monday morning bnt
receiv d a letter from Miss
Perkins, secretary of the Board,
that Dr. Swope would not get to
Deming until seven p. m., and
that the meeting would be held
immediately after. Mr. Heath
would not undertake to make a
trip from Deming home nfter
dark on account of the muddy
roads und did not go.
One man came down from Dem
ing the first of the week and sta
ted to the Courier that there were
13 car8 stuck in the mud on the
road. Would it not bo a good idea
to spend some of the 100,000 re
alized from the road bonds on
this highway, and put it in a con
dition that it could be traveled?

Trustees Pay Bills.
A meeting of the Village Boaid
of Trustees was hold Tuesday
evening, this being the regular
monthly meeting night on which
all bills are supposed to be paid
and any other business that may
come before the board. There
seemed to be but little other
business, but there was a good
lot of bills. The largest was
Momsen-Dunnegan & Ryan Co's
bill for $288 for COO feet of four
inch pipe with the necessary
connections. A bill of $203 was
presented and paid for a pump
jack. The other bills reoresent
ed the current expenses.
The four-inch pipe will be laid
from the new well to the old and
connected with the old system -t
present. The new well should
have been in use long before now
but for some reason or other J.
C. Kauffuian, the contractor, has
been unable to complete the
lower and lam;. His contract
colled for the completion of the
job by August nth. He was in
hliucted to appear before the
board Tuesday evening but failed
to do so. The Trustees decided
that if he did not stiow sufficient
reasons for the delay at the meet
ing next Tuesday evening, they
would declare ills contract null
and void and make arrangements
to complete tiie work themselves.

Lapis Lazuli Vein Found
A unique and important dis
covery has just been made of a
tissure vein of lapis lazuli or
lazurite, about 100 miles west of
121 Paso, over the El Paso and
Southwestern Railroad, in the
north-western part of Tres Her
in an as (Three SIters)mountains,
12 miles northwest of Columbus
1 in Southern New Mexico. This
is practically the first discovery
I of this rare and precious stone
in quantity ever made in the
I United Slates, as only small de
I posits have been found in one
other place, in the state of
California. In this newly dis
covered vein there is believed to
bean inexhaustible body of it,
which can be mined from the
very service. Its use in the arts,
in the manufacture of imperish
able dyes, in decorative architec
tural and ornamental work, and
as a precious gem, renders it ol
great commercial value.
The discovery was made by
W.J. Holmes, a mining man of
El Paso, who while operating a
zinc mine in these mountains,
chanced to notice some speci
mens in the cabin of an old negro
prospector. Mr. Holmes, who
had lived in San Francisco and
had seen the lazurite in the
famous lapidary of Kincaid that
came from Russia some 20 years
ago, instantly recognized it, and
began prospecting for the vein,
winch he tinally discovered last
week.
The vein occurs as stated in a
tissure vein in granite, having a
northwest, southeast strike,
showing on the surface a width
of one foot to five feet, aud a
strong outcrop of oyer 1,000 feet
in length. Along the surface of
the claim are large boulders of
the rock scattered around, some
of them weighing half a ton each,
all of which are colored and
banded or seamed with a beauti
ful blue color. Samples of the
rock have been tested in the local
assay o Dices and laboratories,
aud others have been polished,
witli the result that the rock Is
pronounced to be lapis lazuli. A
claim has been located by Mr.
Holmes, Claude A. Brown and
Fred E. Cunningham of El Paso
on the vein, under the United
States Mining laws, which is
named the Lapis-Lazull Ultra
murine mine. The owners are
anxious to start development
work at once, and will put the
product on the market as soon as
possible. Some idea of its value
may be understood when it is
stated that the genuine ultra
marine pigment extracted from
lapis lazuli and running only 8
per cent was worth, just prior
to the war, iiOO per ounce, and
is now much higher. This pig
tnent has an imperishable color,
as is evidenced in paintings of
the ancients still in existence, as
well as in vase unearthed in Italy
and Greece, which were made of
tins rare stout'. As a gem, it is
said to be woi th per karat. H

Mass. Regiment
Moved to New Camp
Boys Now Settle and Like Camp
Better Than the Old One. The
Ground Is High and Naturally
Drained.
The Second Massachusetts InJ
fantry has moved to the new
camp site northwest of town,
and are well pleased with their
new location. The ground is
higher, and it is sandy und does
not get muddy. They are also
in a location that will be free
from the big dusts in the spring.
The water system at this camp
has been installed, so that it is
very convenient. Pipes have
been run all through the site and
plenty of bath-houses provided.
There is an ample supply of
water for the regiment, and
another well Is being sunk in
their camp, which will supply
more troops to be camped there.
Large comfortable mess halls
have been erected, and every
thing arranged to make the men
as comfortable as conditions in
the field will permit.
The camp is laid off in streets
snd alleys. Several houses for
officers have been erected, and
others are being built as fast as
the carpenters can do the work
It is thought by the army men
that this is one of the best loca
tions for a camp on the border,
and that it will be the largest.
Tho Second . Regiment Senti
nel, ttie Massachusetts boys
publication, has tiie following to
say in regard to the move :
When it was rumored that the
old Second Regiment was going
to break camp and move, most of
us spoke our minds on ttie subject
in phrases and expressions not
found in the best efforts of famous
writers. We were comfortable
and settled, and at home and
well what was tho use of moving
anyway and being all torn up for
a week, aud then Friday morning
the order was given to pack and
the camp just "folded its tents
like the Arabs, and silently stole
away. it just feu uown about
our feet and faded out of sight in
steady stream of trucks and
wagons. It was none so quicmy
and easily that anyone who lost
his goat didn't have a halter on it
And then we got to tbe new camp
and have been congratulating
ourselves ever since. The street s
are laid out in tine shape and
everyone is once more settled
and at home. The dining halls
made a big hit aud although some
of us were table shy, wa are all
broke In now and sit right at the
table as if we were used to it.
One of the most pleasing features
of tiie new camp is the fact that
we can look around and see some
thing besides sand. The brush
gives a general greeness that is
most welcome. If we could only
Import a tree oh well, we will be
wanting valets next.
Three Gamblers Fined
In police court tills week Will
Mason was tried on a charge of
public nuisance, and was ordered
to leave town- Mrs. Claude
Artego appeared to answer to
a charge of petit larceny, which
resulted in a settlement of the
case by the defendant paying
tho costs. R. E. Miller barely
missed a jail sentence for issuing
a worthless check. He made tlie
check good and paid tho costs.
Howard Pearce, W. B. Long .and
Jesse Cleaveland (colored) each
paid $2 and costs for gambling.
O. E. Holland added $5 to the
villoffe funds for an assault.
