NOTE
SENATOR
Chamberlain 'of Oregon Al
leges Pernicious Lobbying
on Part of Canadian Of
ficials Agabst Measure.
Washington, Bept. 8. The senate
lobby committee will Investigate
charges of Senator .Chamberlain,
made on the floor late last night, that
Sir Joseph Polk and other Canadian
officials lob-bled against adoption or
the Chamberlain amendment to the
revenuo bill. This would have pre
vented admission Into the United
States or halibut or salmon from the
north Pacific, except when the Dsh
waa sent In bond from an American
port.
The Investigation was ordered by
a resolution introduced today by
Senator Curtis, republican, of Kansas,
just before adjournment of congress
and adopted without a vote.
The lobby charge was made by
Senator Chamberlain, Oregon, when
the conference committee reported
the amendment, adopted by the sen-
tate, had been stricken out. Cham
berlain declared striking out the sec
tion wss a "humiliating and disgrace
ful surrender toy the United States to
the Canadian government In the in
terest or Canadian commerce."
Senator Curtis' resolution was
tabled, but he Introduced a second
one, saying:
"It Is charged a lobby representing
a rorelgn government has lobbied
against passage of a resolution which
would have protected an American In
dustry 'against commercial aggran
disement by an industry or a foreign
country."
PARTY LEADERS EXPRESS VIEVS OH
UK OF CONGRESS I
Washington, Sept. 8. Democrats
and republicans entertain very differ
ent views of the congress session Just
ended. Statements by Senate Ma
jority leader Kern and Acting Min
ority lieader Smoot prove It.
Kern said:
"The problems presented to this
congress for solution were grave and
momentous. The first Important
work was to provide for the mobilisa
tion and reorganisation or the army
and for the creation of a great navy.
There ibelng much difference or opin
ion throughout the country on these
questions, the work or preparing sat
isfactory and efficient legislation was
difficult. Upon the disposition ot
these questions came the problem ot
how to raise the vast sums or money
to carry out the preparedness pro
gram. Those who clamored most
loudly for preparedness objected
most seriously to paying their share
ot the bill, but after great labor the
revenue hill has been enacted. Fair
(n Its provisions, It will command the
respect of the country, The rural
credits bill and good roads bill, and
measures of Improvement of the par-
cols post and rural delivery will ap
peal strongly to the farmer. The
child labor bill and the workmen's
compensation bill will appeal strongly
to the humanitarians of the republic.
' "Considering the great problems
presented and the splendid spirit
shown In meeting them, this congress
will compare favorably with any pre
vious congress."
Fmoot said:

Berlin. Sept 8. The allies have

grand offensive against the central
powers opened with a Russian attack
three months ago. , " .
This estimate was made today by
German military experts, who aald
they thought it conservative. ; , ,
Against these losses the allied
armies have only the conquests ot
Bukovlna and some Gallclan terri
tory by the Russians, the capture of
Gorltz by the Italians, a shallow
thrust into the German lines on the
Somme and the occupation ot the
mountainous Transylranian territory
by the Roumanians as positive mili
tary achievements.
The armies of the central powers,
keeping their lines Intact everywhere
under tremendous pressure, at the
same time struck back with success-,
ful blows in the Balkans.. The But-.,
garians advanced on both flanks to .
positions menacing the allies In'

forces struck a severe blow against' .

Some Austrian experts and a num
