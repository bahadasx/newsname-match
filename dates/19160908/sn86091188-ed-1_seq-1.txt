Flower Show Commended
The Boise Statesman quotes Mrs.
Alfred Eoff, a recent visitor at the
home of Mrs. George L. Shoup and
daughters as fohows:
''Boise can surely take note of
little Salmon in its flower show," ,
remarked Mrs. Eoff, speaking of j
her trip. ''The Worn id's club of ;
that city arranged this flower
show as au annual event and a
highly successul one it was.
''Not only were prizes offered j
for special flowers and fot general
display, but the event was made j
tu serve as a get-acquainted social 1
and the citizens of Coallls, tlie
next nearest town, were the
guests of the city for that day.
Their meals were furnished free. ,
"The big hall where the show
was held wa9 decorated with ta
bles of many colors. For Instance,
the yellow table was a mass of
golden glow which formed the
background for an old wed from
which lemonade was drawn The
red table was in red sweet peas
and red candles were sold. The
pink table was converted into a
tea garden wi'li Japanese maidens
in attendance.
'The flowers were beautiful
specimens which had been grown
with care and tlie display would
have done credit to a city five
times the size of Salmon. The
event has encouraged the growing
of oner lowers and more of them
each year. 1 liked the suit it of
