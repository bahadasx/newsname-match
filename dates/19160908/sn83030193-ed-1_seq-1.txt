which her father bestowed upon her.
Following many disputes over tho

Mrs. Helen Valk Borden, sho was

Lake, N. .!. That was In 1013, when
she was Just seventeen, and had ai.

tho sanitarium for a while, but tlrej
of It and fled In un automobile with
two women.
Her disappearance cnused a nntlonal
sensation, and tho search spread to
many cities. Thi only cluo was that

auto. After four days she was found
In Boston and lestored to her father.
Then It was that sho gave out her
famous Interview, saying:
"I wanted happiness. I longed for
a mother's love I was weary of
boarding schools and tho paid affection
of strangers. 1 had ilches ut my com
mand, I hod servants at my beck and
call, but I had no onn to whom I
could pour out my heart.
"Daughters of ilch people, arn not
nlwujfi happy. I haven't had a homo
for years. What I wanted was Just
a home anil a mother."
.Miss lloidin was Immediately
dulilmd tho "Boor Llttlo Rich Girl,"
and as such has llgured In the papurs
on many occailons. Her disappear
ance led to subsequent reports of wild
lllglitn from various Institutions, but
nono of tlieso wero bornn out. Then
she went to California with her
mother and her llfo (lowed moru
smoothly.
"I havo novor known happiness un
til 1 found It here," she said. "I ran
away simply to show my father that
