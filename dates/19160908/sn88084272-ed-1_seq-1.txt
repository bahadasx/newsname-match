The president's statement follows:

"It is to be regretted tbat the ses

it was not not feasible in the circum

"The rest, it is agreed, has merely
been postponed until it can be more

have every reason to believe that it is
the purpoe of the leaders of the two

night before the American Woman Suf

were bad. particularly those affecting
women and cnildren. but then our men
were so much better than our laws,
so why worry The much-vaunted
southern chivalry was so real that it

going to need protection against men.

'As long as it was a question of,,nff having been blasted off. A large'

a vestige of sex antagonism, the south-

particularly among the more fortunate
classes that her leisure had come to
mean laziness Right about face she
turned, and she said to the southern
man" I don't wish to usurp your place

' Not only the southern woman but
the southern man is now awake, and
present conditions strongly indicate
that before another year has passed,
we will have some form of suffrage
for the women of our state. You know

Bisbee, Arizona, Sept. S.
Editor El Paso Herald: r
1 am sure it will be -ratifyin to you to know that The Herald is enjoy
iiip an enormous circulation ami is read throughout the southern section of
the U. S. A., from coast to coa&t. as is evidenced by the hundreds of letters
we have received in reply to a recent article in your paper to the effect that
there were numerous positions open here, to vrhieh I could direct applicants.
In an endeavor to trace the origin of the article, I find that our sister
association, the Y. M. C A., recently sent out a short article announcing a
shortage of dome-tic help in Bibee and evidently some one sent The Herald
the article statin" that the Y. 31. C. A. was looking for men.
No harm was done, but I Have had to add extra stenographers to answer
the correspondence. a. B. Richardson.
