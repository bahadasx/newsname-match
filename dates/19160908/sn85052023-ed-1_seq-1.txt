$1,200 HOP LICENSE
CITY COUNCIL INCREASES FEE
ON SALE OF SOFT DRINKS
W. C. T. U. Women Present Petition
to City Fathers Asking Raise
and Council Votes 5 to 1
A bombshell was thrown into the
ranks of the proprietors of soft drink
stands in Stanford at the regular
monthly meeting of the Stanford
City Council Thursday night when
the annual license on such places
was raised from $200 to $1,200. A
numerously signed petition was pre
sented to the Council asking for its
increase, the petition stating that
the additional sum sought to be rais
ed was needed for the expenses of
the city. This was stated in the peti
tion, it is understood, to come with
in the provisions of the law on the
subject as recently interpreted by
the Court of Appeals, though, of
course, the real object behind the
movement was to make the license
so high that no one will be able to
pay it and the "hop joints" will have
to go out of business. Ladies of the
local chapter of the W. C. T. U. cir
culated the petitions Thursday and
presented them to the council that
night. Five of the six councilmen
voted for the increase, Councilmen
Rupley, W. B. Hill, Harry Hill,
Reinhart and O'Bannon. Councilman
Will Hocker voted against the raise.
"The new ordinance was offered by
W. B. Hill and seconded by Dr. O'Ban
non.
Under the interpretation of City
Attorney T. J. Hill and other lawyers,
the increase in license does not ap
ply to the license of the soft drink
stand proprietors now in effect, but
will become effective when their an
nual licenses expire. The council
granted Mat Martin a renewal of his
license for another year a few weeks
ago; the license of J. C. Lynn ex
pires Jan. 1st next, while that of
John Hayden, colored, expires in
October. The increased license applies
to all malt drinks, such as Near
Been, Malt-Mead, hops and any drink
of the sort such as is usually sold in
dry territory.
The council authorized Chief of
Police Carter to have a special po
liceman appointed for county court
day to be stationed on Church street
where the "horse jockeys" congre
gate on court days and sometimes be
come quite boisterous in their trad
ing operations. The rest of the busi
ness before the City Fathers was
merely of a routine nature.

assembling at an early hour on that
pleasant day and soon the large lawn
was alive with as jolly good looking
and intelligent a crowd as ever as
sembled. Joyful greetings, singing,
instrumental music and reminiscen
ces of the family were among the
features of the meeting. Then at the
noon hour such, a spread of good
things was never equalled. Every
thing good to eat, cooked in the most
appetizing way, temptingly spread,
was eagerly partaken of and cider
fresh from the mill, lemonade and all
kinds of frozen delicacies added
their part to the feast. Among the
sixty-four present were: Mrs. Lizzie

church. Work to begin Oct 1st, and
hope to have all ready by the last of
same month. Rev. Wyatt is chief
booster in this work assisted by Mr.
Skiles, Sunday School Superintend
ent and other good workers. While
we are in favor of this needed addi
tion, Ave are certainly in favor of
something being done towards put
ting a good bell on the church, the
very first thing, and we are backed
in this by two thirds majority, many
of whom say they will contribute
nothing until this much needed im
provement has been assured. The
first days soliciting for funds to start
the building amounted to $211.
