LETTERS DEMAND
Governor Says Best Evidence
Writer Is Crazy Is Asking
Him for $20,000
Sacramento, t'al., Sept. 8. Although
(loveinor Hiram Johnson speaks light
ly of mysterious letters slipped under
the door of his mansion in which his
life was threatened unless he came
across with $'40,000, United States sec
ret service men and local police nre
working diligently today to round up,
what they believe to be a ring of black
mailers on the governor's trail.
One man,. Carmine Pfundi, an Itnl
inn, is under arrest as a suspect. He
was lying in the grass near a fountain
at 1-th and L streets, where tho let
ter demanded that the money be plac
ed, when secret servico men took him
in tow Wednesday afternoon. Pfundi
denies any knowledge of the letters.
Chief of Police Conran admitted that
the police "have nothing positive on
Pfundi."
The governor believes the letters
came from some insane person. "The
best evidence they came from a crazy'
man is that $20,000 was demanded of
me," Johnson said. "I have been
threatened so often t nut this sort of
thing no longer bothers me. I am
sorry there has been publicity about
it."
The first letter, found last Monday,
demanded $15,000. The second, dis
covered Thursday morning, called for
$.),000 additional.
Pfundi," the suspect, says he only
went to the place where he was found
to take a rest.

ALLIES HAVE LOST

IN THREE MONTHS
This Estimate Made by Ger
mans Includes Killed,

FOR THIS LOSS THEY HAVE
BUT FEW GAINS TO SHOW
German Experts Think Furth
er Advance of Allies Prac
tically Impossible
By Wilbur 8. Forrest .
(Tinted Press staff correspondent.)
London, Sept. 8 The Bulgarian right
wing, moving up the Black sea coast,
has occupied the Rumanian seaport
towns of Balchik and Cavarna, at the
same time taking two other Rumaniaa
villages in conjunction with the Ger
mans. '
An official statement from the Bul
garian war office this afternoon re
ported this vicinity but also admitted
an important Rumanian success. The
Rumanians have captured the fortified
Hungarian town of Orsovo, opening the
way to a new invasion of Hungary.
Orsovo is on the Dannbe near the
junction of tne Rumanian, Hungarian
and Serbian frontiers. It is a few
miles above the iron gates of the Den
ube ajid has considerable importance.
It has a population of about 0,000.
Strong Russiau forces reinforcing the
Rumanians near the Rumanian town of
Doberic, have been beaten back by the
Herman-Bulgarian nrmies, said an of
ficial statement issued at Berlin this
afternoon.
While heavy fighting continued on
both western and eastern fronts, there
were no such radical changes as mark
ed the battles reported yesterday.
Estimate of Allies Losses.
Berlin, Sept. 8. The allies have lost
more than a million men In killed,
wounded and missing since the grand
offensive against the central powers
opened with a Russian attack three
months ago.
This estimate was made today by
German military experts who said they
thought it conservative. Against these
losses the allied armies hnvc only the
conquests of Bukowina and some (la
liciau territory by the Russians, tho
capture of Uoritz by the ltuliuns, a
shallow thrust into the German lines
on the Horn me and the occupation of
mountainous Trnnsylvanian territory
by the Rumnninns as positive mili
tary achievements.
The armies of tho central powers,
keeping their lines intuct everywhere
under tremendous pressure at the same
time struck buck with successful blows
in the Balkans. The Bulgarians nd
anced on both flanks to positions men
acing the nllies in Greece. Germnn and
Bulgarian forces struck n severo blow
against the Rumanians by occupying
Tutrakun fortress, one of the bridge
head positions defending Bucharest.
The losses o'f the allies as conserv
atively estimated here, follow:
Iiussiuns 000.000.
British 2110,000.
French 150,000.
Italian, Serbian and Rumanian com
bined 50,000.
Some Austrian experts nnd a num
ber of Germans have estimated the
Russian losses at more than 800,000 and
the combined British and French losses
at more than 400,000. Official casual
ty losts given out at London show
British losses of about 1 25,000 for the
month of August alone.
The danger of any serious reverse on
either the western or eastern fronts is
believed to have passed. But any ad
ditional gains, it is held here, must be!
made at such a frightful additional cost
in human lives nnd with such an extrav
agant waste of munitions that the peo
ple of the allied countries will cry for
pence.
News of the capture of Tutrakan for
tress and the surrender o'f 20,000 Ru
manians aroused more enthusiasm here
than even the military Importance of
the victory justified. Next to an inva
sion of England no movement would be
more popular here than a drive north
ward to the capital of Rumania because
of the universal opinion that the Ru
manians treacherously deserted theil
allies in declaring war.
Will Continue to Strike.
London, Sept. 8. Renewed iufnntrt
onslaughts by the Anglo-French troop
of even greater magnitude than the suc
cessful strokes earlv this week on th
Somme aro certain to follow the inces
sant night and day bombardment of th
German lines. The allies intend to givt
the Genua ns no rest.

kaiser has returned to the Somme front

Passage of Bill
Washington, Sept. 8. The senate lob
by committee will investigate charge
of Senator Chamberlain, made on the
floor late last night that Kir Joseph
I'olk and other Canndiau officials lob
bied against adoption of the Chamber
lain amendment to the revenue bill. This
would have prevented admission into
the United States of halibut or salmon
from the North Pacific, except when the
fish were sent in bond from an Amer
ican port.
The investigation' was ordered by a
resolution introduced today by Senator
Curtis just before adjournment of con
gress, and adopted without a vote. '
The lobby charge was made by Sen
ator Chamberlain, Oregon, when the
conference committee reported the
amendment, adopted by the senate hnd
been stricken out. Chamberlain de
clared striking oat the section was a
"humiliating and d!."-yraeef ul surrender
by the United State, to the Canadian
government in the interest of Canadian
commerce."
Curtis resolution was tabled, but
he introduced a second one, saying:
"It is charged a lobby representing
a foreign government has lobbied
against passage of a resolution which
would have protected an American in
dustry against commercial aggrandise
ment by an industry of a foreign coun

By Robert J. Bender,
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Sept. 8 "It's been good
work. "
With these words President Wilson
affixed his xiguature to the revenue
bill today nnd indicated to leaders of
the house and senate that the Sixty
Fourth congress so far as it depends
on his wishes cuuld come to a close.
Something of an informal 'function
was made of the ceremony of signing the
last bills of the session. Present were
several cabinet members, including Sec
retaries I-ansing, Gregory, Baker and
Daniels. Vice-President Marshall and
Speaker Clark were on hand, as well as
a number of members of both houses.
Sighs of relief, mingled with the
click of cameras as the president put
the final flourish on his signature that
made the revenue bill a law. He nlready
had sigued the workmen's compensa
tion net and the widow's pension bill
the latter while Senators Hoke Smith
and Bryan, chief opponents of it, looked
on with rueful grins.
The president shook hands with sev
eral of the party nnd left the -room',
accompanied by the Missouri delegation.
All were caught af the Capitol steps by
a movie man, ,
"Hurry up Mr. Speaker," called the
president to Clark, who lagged behind
a bit, "you are losiug out on a fine

The president plans to spend the
night at Atlantic City, making the trip
from there to Long Brunch by automo

Hughes Making Hot
Campaign In Maine
By Perry Arnold
(United Press staff correspondent) '
Lewiston, Maine, Sept. 8. Republi
can Nominee Hughes blazed a trail
across Maine . today with whacks he
took at democracy.
The nominee is "opening up" in his
speeches, very much to the satisfaction
of Maine republican leaders. What is
apparently making tho most emphatic
hit with his audiences is the hammer
and tongs way in which ho is assail
ing recent democratic enactments.
The nominee is a regular glutton for
campaigning. He also is "getting on
to" angles of the newspaper game and
becoming "wise" to the necessity of
seeing that his remarks are dissemi
nated fully.

Man Arrested in Reno for
Swindling San Francisco
Store Is Murderer
San Francisco, Sept. 8. When A. B.
Smith, alias W. F. Dashey, was ar
rested in Reno today on charge of
swindling a big San Francisco store out
of $500 worth of goods, he was identi
fied as a man wanted for the murder
of Sheriff Dwight ' Stevens of Luna
county, New Mexico,
Stevens was shot and killed bv a
man he was trying to arrest on Feb
ruary 20 last. Identification was made
by comparing the description of Smith
with those cent out by the New Mexico
authorities.
A man who gave the name of G. A.
Bonelli, of Kingman, Ariz., entered a
local store in August, opened an ac
count and bought $500 worth of goods.
He tried to cash a check for $100,
and this aroused the suspicion of the
store managers.
Detectives located the man's room
and found all th goods excepting a
suit and several flashy vests. They
also discovered that the man's descrip
tion fitted that of Sheriff Stevens'
slayer. By means of the suit and vests
Smith or Dashey was Identified at Reno
and taken into custody. He will be
taken to New Mexico immediately. ,

Washington, Sept. 8. Congress ad
journed at 10 o'clock today.
ino session mat lasted longer and
saw more dramatic momenta than any
in recent history and that had appro-
pnuieu inuto money man any congress
.receding it, came to a close amid
scenes that contained little of the spec
tacular. ' . ,
Tho senate waited until 9:40 today
to auopi ine joint resolution setting
the adjournment hour. The house had
gone through with its adjournment res
olution early last night.
iiuring a two hour mornine session
there was only a slight undercurrent of
real work, but a lot of speech makinif
of the eaglo screaming variety and
some fun.
The senate continued on its course
of politics and legislation until the very
lust minuto when, exactly five min
utes before ten, Senators Kerns and
Smoot, democrat and ropublican lead
ers, named to wait on the president, an
nounced the decision to adjourn had
the president's approval.
At tho same moment hostilities and
hilarities in the house stopped at the

A shout went up as Speaker Clark

A Weary Old Bunch
Washington, Sept. 8. A handful of
weary, red eyed senators convenod at
the unholy hour of 8 o'clock this morn
ing to hear themselves talk until the)
revenue bill, passed shortly before ad
journment at 1 a. m. can be engrossed
by tho public printer and signed by
tno president of tho chamber.
The most important piece of legisla
tion confronting the senate was a res
olution to adjourn at 1(1 o'clock.
The house was more considerate of it
self. It passed tho joint resolution to
adjourn nt 10 a. m. and then quit bus
iness shortly after 10 o'clock last
night, after resolving to give its mem
bers a half hour longer to sleep this
morning. The resolution to meet at
8::!0 instead of 8 carried, also tho
agreement to adjourn for keeps at 10
a. m.
The only reason the session was not
adjourned lust night was because of
the physical inability of the publie,
printer, his tvpe setters and tho jour
nal clerks of both houses to get the
revenue and emorgency deficiency
bills pussed without record votes, at
the Inst minute last night, in Bhape for
the president to sign when he went to
his capitol offices today.
Many senators appeared today with
only a washed face, a bito of break
fast and a cat nap on n couch to show
for the brief respite since adjourning
early this morning. Moro arrived at
the capitol just in time to vote ayo on
tne motion that pussed tho last session
of the Sixty Fourth congress into tho
congressional archives. Many left
Washington lust night, and another ex
odus todaycurried additional member
