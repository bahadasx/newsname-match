I both."

! High School Adopts Novel Method of
Teaching Typewriting— In
duce Easy Motion of Wrist
and Hand
A departure from the ordinary
j methods of teaching typewriting will
j be found in the new and somewhat
: novel method adopted by the Pull
j man high school this year, when a
phonograph and records were in
stalled in the commercial depart
ment, under the supervision of Miss
Gertrude Mallette, and the students
will practice to the tunes emitted by
the musical instrument. In explana
tion of this movement on the part
of the commercial department, Miss
Mallette said:
"There is nothing new in the basic
idea of working to music. The
United States navy has for years
coaled ship with the band playing,
and there are a thousand and one
other connections in which the value
of rhythm has been demonstrated.

Our purpose is using the phonograph
in the typewriting room is first oi
all to induce an easy movement oi
the wrist and hand, after that to se
cure a light touch, and finally tc
assist the student in achieving thai
degree of speed without which typing
is useless. Eastern commercial
schools have been using the phono
graph in the typewriting rooms for
some time, and the value of the
method has been demonstrated be
yond any possibility of doubt."
The idea is fast becoming popular
in the larger educational institutions
and phonographs will be Installed
this year in the commercial depart
ment at the State College. The
Pullman high school enjoys the dis
tinction of being one of the first, II
not the first, high schools In this
state to adopt this method of teach
ing typewriting, and that the ay stem
is popular with the students is nidi
cated by the fact that the typewriting
class is already filled almost to ca
pacity, there being room for only six
additional students in the classes.
BRYAN It..MA MONDAY .NIGHT
A big rally for Enoch A. Bryan
of this city, candidate for the repub
lican nomination for United States
senator, will lie held on the Street!
next Monday evening, the night be
fore the primary election. Dr.
Bryan himself will speak, ns well as
several others, and efforts will be
made to insure a full vote for the
' primary. It is expected that Dr.
i Bryan will receive the biggest vote
ever cast for a single candidate in
Pullman.
State Auditor C. W. Clausen has
directed the city council to add the
■ sum of $70 to its budget of expense
I for 1917 to cover the cost of examin
: ing the city books and records by the

HIGH SCHOOL GRIDIRON
WORK BEGINS MONDAY
| Football Hampered by I-tck of Ath
letic Field—Good Materia- at
Hand Indicates Strong
Team
The- football season for Pullman
high school will begin next Monday,
September 11, when Coach Savage
1 will Issue his first call Tor candi
! dates. Considerable delay and diffi
\ culty in starting the football train
! ing was occasioned by the fact that,
! through the abandonment by the
! chamber of commerce of its lease on
j the Mrs. Koppel property, east of the
| city park, the high school squad is
left without an athletic field. Pre
liminary training will start in earn
est, however, in anticipation of the
I securing of adequate training and
playing grounds before the season is
far advanced.
Notwithstanding the difficulties
; encountered, Coach Savage and Cap
tain Mclver expect to have a strong
team lined up when the whistle blows
j for the first game of the season, with
| Palouse, the latter part of this
month. The old men who will be
back in the game to form a nucleus
i for the team Include Captain Mclver,
j Miller, Glover, Shirk, Nash, Barclay,
1 George, Lingg and Stone. The new
I material, while not yet tried out,
looks better than usual. While the
complete schedule has not yet been
arranged, it is expected that games
will be played with Palouse, Colfax,
Tekoa, W. 8. C. Preps, Lewiston and
Walla Walla. Suits and lockers will
be assigned t*> tbe candidates Friday
evening.
Basket ball prospects also look
bright, all of last year's winning
players having returned to school.

Total high school enrollment, 150.
Enrollment in all grades and high
school, 620.
The high school enrollment is
smaller than usual at this period of
the year, owing to the large number
of larger boys who are still in the
harvest field. The increase In the
grades below the high school more
than make up for the loss in the high
school. At the close of the first
month of last year the grand total
enrollment for the schools was 640.
All Indications are- that the enroll
ment will be much larger this year
than last. The- primary department
of the main school is especially
crowded. All beginners should enter
before October 1 as none will be ad
mitted after that date in grade One
B. No child under six can be en
rolled in the schools.
ASKS $1000 DAMAGES
Claiming that his property on
Maiden Lane was damaged to a large
extent through the new grade estab
lished by the city when the Maiden
Lane paving was laid, T. J. Ellis has
demanded damages In the amount of
$1000 in compensation. The peti
tion from Mr. Ellis to the city coun
cil, which has been turned over to
the city attorney and will be acted
upon by the council later, was as
follows:
"In grading and paving Maiden
Lane you raised the grade of the
street In front of my property, to
wit, lot 4 in, block 7, Reaney's addi
tion to Pullman, more than three
feet above the grade that had been
established and on which I had erect
ed the buildings on my lot, and my
property has been damaged $1000
by the raising of said grade. I there
fore demand that the city pay to me
the damage sustained /to my said
property, arising from the raising of
the grade on said street."
PULLMAN DAY WEDNESDAY
Next Wednesday Is "Pullman
Day" at the Whitman County Fair
at Colfax and a large number of

county seat to assist ln making the
annual event a success. A commit
tee from the chamber of commerce
has been appointed to arrange a
Pullman exhibit for the fair. ..,■,-.'.
