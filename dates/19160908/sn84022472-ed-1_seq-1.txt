farmer of the nortty end - nea the

GOSSIP IN WAKE

s m e s a evw e
ruDiisner's wiaow.
The elite residential neighborhood
of Fairfield' avenue in the vicinity of
Elmwood place is agog today over re
cent incidents in the home of Sarah B,
Candee, widow of John ' D. Candee,
founder of the Standard.'
. Mrs. Candee, who lives at 1249 Fair
field avenue, la not at her home to
day, which is occupied by Mrs. Har
riet C, White, widow of Daniel
White. 1 f
- Reports, that Mrs. Candee was for
cibly taken frdm the home on Sep
tember 1st, after an entrance .had been
effected into the- nouse, and hastily
removed to New Haven by, force, are
partly denied by the family here to
day. Mrs., White asserts that FredWick
ft. Stevens, formerly secretary, treasur
er and manager of the Standard asso
ciation, who once lived with Mrs. Can
dee, came from New Haven on Sep
tember 1st and "took" Mrs; Candee
back to that - city, where 4 she Is now
residing with Mr. Stevens at 120 cot
tage street. Judge Carl Foster has
been retained to attempt a settlement
of the family difficulties which have
been suddenly precipftated by the re
moval of Mrs. Candee from her home
in this city to that of her son-in-law
in New Haven.
' The family here deny with , vigor
that a, doorway in the beautiful Fair
field avenue residence was forced dur
ing the absence of Mrs. White, who
has !ltwmw"rTBf-jr y aged
mother hi this city, asserting that a
trolley car was the medium of trans
portation -used .by Mr. Stevens and
Mrs. Candee. '
A well known firm of New Haven
attorneys has been retained by Mr.
Stevens to protect his Interests as a
result of -his recent trip to this city.
Judge Carl Foster, representing the
White family 'in this city, refuses to
discuss 'the affaira of his clients be
yond admitting that Mrs. Candee is
now in New Haven and that an un
fortunate family difference has caused
his services to be solicited.
"Really, I have not had time to fa!
ty investigate the "actual conditions,
or the facts relating to Mrs. Candee's
removal from this city," said Attorney
Foster to evading direct Inquiry to
day. V- x v
Mrs. Candee, whose husband for
many years was the guildlng genius
of the Standard.' is admittedly a
wealthy woman . For nearly 20 years
she hay occupied 'herpresent residence
In this city. One daughter married
Mr.Stevens and for manf years occu
pied the home with her mother. Re
cently Mrs White, another daughter.
took np residence with her mother,
and Mr. and Mrs. Stevens were seldom
visitors at the home.
Persons acquainted with the family
declare that painful friction resulted
from a minor breach, which upon tbe
removal of Mr. Stevens from this city
grew materially.
The particular Teason ' for'', legal
counsel being called into the dispute
following the remdval from this city
of Mrs. Candee is not made plain by
statements of the family today who
refer all inquirers to Attorney Foster,
though it is denied by Mrs. White, that
violence was used in getting Mrs. Can
dee to visit New Haven. f

REFUSE TO TAKE
VILKES-BARRE'S
MAYOR IN UNION
, .
Slovaks Have First Serious
Dispute, in National Con
- vention in This City: 1
FEELING DUE TO
STRIFE ABROAD
i
Anti-German Sentiment is
Blamed in Some Quarters
For Failure to Qualify.
Refusal' of the Catholic Slovak
Union to act favorably upon "the ad
mission for membership of the mayor
of Wilkes-Barre. at a heated session
late yesterday, brought into the big
national convention here the first in
dication of animosity due to the strife
in Eujope.
Because it was -'charged that the
mayor, though of Slavonian birth, is
of German ancestry, there were many
adverse votes, due, according to re
ports about the convention hall, to the
fact that there was a pronounced anti
German sentiment in certain of the
delegates.
The Suggestion of his name for
membership yesterday aroused a dis
pute which brought forth acrimon
ious statements on the part of mem
bers and threatened to sadly divide
the assemblage. Delegates ! are re
portedto have arisen upon the floor
to state that though of Slavonion
birth. Mayor KOsek had German ante
cedents. His champions asserted that
other members in th hall were also
of German' descent and that German
Influence should be eradicated from
the union. A turbulent session was
ended by. the vote which, debarred
Mayor Kosek from election.
The battle continued throughout
discussion held after the convention
closed yesterday and renewed scenes
of argument were enacted In the hall
tedaywhen the question of Increasing
the salaries of the local officers- was
discussed. ' '
The entire morning session was
consumed In , debate which at times
ran exceedingly high, with accusa
tion and recrimination running rife.
It was finally. decided to increase the
salary of the president from $800 to
$1,200, the two vice presidents from
$50 to $100 each and the financial
secretary from $1,000 to $1,800.
.The addition of another vice presi
dent tor the purpose of an increased
organization campaign brought forth
the assertion that the . order expects
to. increase from 60,000 members to
over 100,000 during the next biennial
period. v
.Theophile' Chuddy, of Bridgeport
appealed for a collection for the wid
ows and orphans abroad, which will
be taken during the year.
. A donation of more than $1,000 is
to be made for the benefit of young
priests at St. Francis school, Brook
lyn, N. T. This vote was taken at
the afternoonvsession of the conven
tion and a commltee appointed to
confer with 'Rev. Z. Kazimer. who
mde the request. The1 donation will
cover $50 per pupil at the school. '
Representatives from various Mid
dle Western cities attended to con
vention yesterday to request that the
next meeting be held in thelr city.
The claims of the cities are now be
ing considered.
TWO LICENSES
FOR TERRITORY i
NEAR ARMS CO.
Remonstrants Likely to Ap
peal From County Com
missioners' Ruling.
The first liquor dealers to get 11-
Kcenses within the hitherto restricted
Barnum avenue territory are Jacob
Hausman and Pak Bros., who were
granted transfers tjils morning by the
county commissioners. Until the pres
ent time there have oeen no saloons
on Barnum avenue between Seavlew
avenue and the Stratford line.- '
Many residents and manufacturers
have been anxious to keep saloons out
and liquor dealers, realizing the rich
profits to be made, "have been fight
ing hard to get a foothold there.
Hausman formerly conducted a place
in Willard street. His transfer gives
him permission to locate at 17 SO aBr
num avenue. Pak Bros are given the
right to transfer from North Wash
ington avenue to Barnum avenue and
Elizabeth street.
There were hi remnnntmni-u
against both applications. The Rem
ington Arms and the Remington-y.
M. C. Co. opposed the transfers on the
ground that the establishment of new
saloons would prove harmfulto em
ployes. The Whiting Manufacturing
Co. and numerous other taxpayers op-
posea the applications, too. It is prob
able the remonstrants will appeal the
cases to the superior court.

Union Officers Declare That
More , Than 7,000 Men
Are on Strike.
New York, Sept. 8. With subwaj
and elevated trains being operated ap
parently on normal schedule, traction
officials insisted today that New
York's strike has been broken. Fifty
per cent, of the "Green cars" of the
New oYrk Railways Company's sur
face system were running, the com
pany announced.
Union leaders, on the other hand,
claimed at "noon that 3,500 men were
on strike on the subway and elevated
roads of the Interborough Rapid
Transit Company and $,000 men on
the "Green car" system.
Theodore P. Shonts, president of
the Interborough, announced that all
,pf the men who have struck on the
New York Railways lines owned by
the Interborough could have their
positions back, with rtheir former
places of seniority restored to them,
if they resigned from the union by
1 p. m., tomorrow.
When the surface cars were started
out again at 6 o'clock, this morning,
the situation was in charge of James
T. Waddell, known as the king of
strike breakers. Mr. Waddell came
here from Chicago last night, making
the run by special train in 20 hours.
He promised to crush the strike in
48 hours. ,
"I have 8,500 strike-breakers here,"
said Waddell, "and 1,700 of these are.
now working. They are more than
enough to control the situation."
Subway and elevated trains ran last
night and this morning as usual. Fear
ing that the strikers, would be able to
interrupt this service, thousands of
persons yesterday patronized the mul
titude of jitney automobiles that mob
ilize at every important center but

proach to a mob riot. Strike nympa'
thizers on the proofs of tenement
houses bombarded the trains with
bottles and bricks and in one instance
with pistol shots. None of the bnl
lets took effect but several passengers
were cut by missiles and broken
glass. The police surrounded the
blocks from which the missiles came
and searched the roofs but made only
a few arrests.

in many respects, with appropriations and authorizations for i
the future running well towards two billion dollars.
In a statement issued followed the adjournment of Con- j
gress, President Wjlson called attention to the "helpful and i
humane legislation", passed and declared that while he regret- i
ted additional legislation dealing with the recent dispute be
tween the railroads and their employes had not been compl'et-
ed he had every reason to believe the question would be taken
up. immediately after Congress reassembled. '
PRESIDENT HAS
FOR CONGRESS
i i
Hopes For Completion of

Next Session.
Washington, Sept. 8. Following the
adjournment of Congress today, Pres
ident Wilson issued the following
statement: -
"A commendable cession of Con
gress has just closed, full, as all re
cent eseions of Congress have been,
of Aelpful and humane legislation
wit ich constituted i contributions ot
cai.tal importance, to the defense, the
economic progress, and wholesome Ufa I

"It is to be regretted that the ses
sion could not have continued long
enough to complete the program re
cently projected with regard, to the
accommodation of labor disptites be
tween the railways and the employes,
but It was not feasible In the circum
stances to continue the session any
longer and therefore only the mos
immediately pressing parts of the
program could be completed v
"The rest, it la agreed, has merely
been postponed until it-can be more
maturely deliberated and perfected. I
have every reason to believe that it Is
the purpose of the leaders of the two
houses iriamdiately upn the reassem
bling of Congress to undertake his ad
ditional legislation It is evident that
the country should be relieved of the
anxiety which must have been created

future accommodation of such dis
putes" RUBBER STRIKE

v ' i
Organizer Duffy, Uses Good
Offices and Settlement is
Reached Quickly.
i
Striking employes, of the Slemon
Hard) Rubber Co., about 150, whose
walkout early in the week caused
practically a shut-down, will return to
work on Monday. '
A conference attended by commit
tees representing Rubber Works' local,
14.888, affiliated with , the American
Federation of Labor, by Patrick F.
Duffy, organizer of the A. F. of L.,
and by Fred E. SmeeJ, .superintendent,
and his assistant, John Girgoli,
brought about a solution of the diffi
culties.
The strike, a precipitate action, re
sulted from a misunderstanding be
tween Slemon and his employes. He
sought to arrange hte difficulties with
the help by dealing with, them indi
vidually, rather than through the shov
committee, and this and other differ
ences precipitated a walkout.
The conference partook of the na
ture of a family reunion more than a
dispute, and a speedy settlement of
tne differences was effected through
the co-operation of Organizer Duffy.
The result of the settlement is that
there will be a minimum wage for
men ot 30 cents an hour, and of wo
men of 20 cents an hour, whether they
work on day or piece work, and 'the
day workers will get an Increase of 45
cents a day. ,

In Income Tax Law
Washington, Sept 8. Members of
the conference committee on the rev
enue bill today pointed out an im
portant change in the income section

one to '"heads of families" whether
married od not. , replacing the pro
vision of the old law which gave the
larger exemption only to "married
persona,"

Only a small portion of members i
were on hand to watch the session;
