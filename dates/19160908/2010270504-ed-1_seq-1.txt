NEW DEPOT CONTRACT TO
MB LET THIS WEEK.
General Manager Joffors, of the
Union Pacific, Bpent Wednesday even
ing with friends in town while en
rcxuto west. Notwithstanding tho an
xiety and strenuous work brought
about by tho threatened striko, Mr.
Jeffers said he waB fee-ling his best.
"It is reported In town, Mr. Jeffers,
'hat tho plans for the now depot havo
been changed, and tha't Wo are not
to havo so large or costly a structure,"
was a question asked.
"Tho iplans havo boon changed
Eome," said Mr. Jeffers, "but the chan
ges have been wholly on the interior.
The dimension's of tho building and
the estimated cost remain tho same,
and tho structure will' be Just as rep
resented In tho drawing which has
ieen cm exhibition In North Platte."
"When will the contract bo let?"
was -then asked.
"The contract," replied Mr. Jeffers,
"will bo awarded Septombor loth
Friday of next week, and work will
begin just as soon as the successful
bidder can assemble the necessary ma
terial. Tho work will be rushed as
rapidly as consistent with good work
manship and tho ability to seure tho
necessary laborers."
These statements of Mr. Jeffers will
set at rest the rumors of the past
jnonth to4he effect that plans had been
changed and that wo wttluld receive a
much less pretentious building than
originally pllanned.

The Policy that is Different
Thoro has boona growing demand for a plan of lnsurnuco whlcli

Insurance policies '
The nd Endowment Plans.
The life iplan makes protection during life tho chief object Inaur
anco and tho most Important period that wo need this protection Is
during our actlvo period of life, say from 20 to CO years of ago
Tho Endowment plan combines protection with an InvoBtmont feature,
frqrn which tho Insured will reap tho benefit of living at Vuo end of
tho endowment period Under tho usual endowment forms, says 10,
15, 20 or 25 years endowment policies, tho premium Is high for tho
protoctfon afforded (abavo tho averago man's ability to paj) and
whoro tho sacrifice ianiado and thoy aro carried, tho endowment period
comes early in llfo and you usq tho monoy, loso the protection oarly
In llfo and when you como to old ago you aro not much better off.
Tho Fidelity now Issues a policy, to a great oxtont, comblnlns tho
