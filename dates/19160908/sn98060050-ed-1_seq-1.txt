THREE MEN HURT ON O. V.
Passenger Car from Brattleboro en

Three persons wore injured when
lidHsciijjcr train No. 2 on tho Central

J. Kelley, mail clerk, nnd C. V. Har
row, lm.'(;nnp miistor, nil of New Lon

The train, which was south bound,
consisted of tho engine, an express

woro thrown from tho track and nil
but the ongino and coacli woro over
turned. Tho engine acpnratotl from
tho tender, which, crashed over on its
side. The oxpress nnd baggngo cars
were thrown across tho track- and up
not, but tho passenger coach remained
upright, though in a position which
inndo it somowlint dilllcult for the six
passengers to get out.
Express Messongor Church hud tnken
o:i nt Ainhorst a largo number of wood
en enses filled with lints, and when tbo
crash enino ho was thrown to one end
of the enr with tho boxes on top of
him. Help was necessary to get him
out from undor tho pile of boxes. His
injuries are not serious, consisting
chielly of sovoro bruises.
Tho track was very badly torn up
iintl t nt Hie was interrupted nil :iight.
The passengers woro transferred to a
Huston & Maine train which came fro'n
tliM west about the time of the wreck,
tho track of that road being close to
tho Central Vermont line. Tho Cen

Boston & Maine track from Belcher
town to South Amherst that evening.
The cause of tho wreck has not been
determined. Tho conductor of tho
wrecked train was Ocorge, L. SpolTord

UNPARALLELED EXTRAVAGANCE.
Tho -long session of tho sixty-fourth
congress will have appropriated $1,700,-
000,000 beforo adjournment. This is
nearly half a million more than was ap
propriated tho last year of the Civil
war. The exact figures for 1860 were
$l,295)0!)0,2S0.o8. These lavish expen
ditures are not due altogether to pre
paredness, ns the Democrats would fnin
linvo us believe. Senntor Curtis in a
recent scnato debate showed that the
11117 increase over 1010 will bo $i51.",'
410,070.02. Tho total increases for pro'
parotlncss will not exceed $300,000,000
This includes tho $20,000,000 for an ar
mor plant and $20,000,000 for a nitrate
plant. This leaves an increase of over
$12."i,000,000 aside from any item that
might be called a part of tho prepared
ness program.
This seems extravagant enough, but
the comparison is with a Democratic
congress. When the comparison is made
with tho "recent Republican congress
es" the Baltimore platform condemned
for "proftignto waste," it is worse still.)
At the close of the sixty-fourth con-'
grcss appropriations had been made to
tho amount of $2,231,000,000 for tho
biciiniuin. This was $177,000,000 more
than was appropriated by the last Re
publican congress If the short session
of thp present congress should equal;
tho record of tho long" congress nnd' it
'may oicQcd It; tho total appropriations
will roach $3,400,000,000, or 'ncarly n
billion.' and .a'j,halfj'morb .than thoso of
'Thoro aro increases for every singlo
dopartmont, except pensions. Tho
donth angel has permitted somo reduc
tions in pensions. Thcro have been
30,000 ofllccs croatcd at an annual cost
of $40,000,000. In the light of such per
formances, it is- interesting to rerend
tho Baltimore economy plank: "Wo de
nounce the profligato waste of tho mon
ey wrung from tho people by oppresi
sive taxation through tho lavish appro
priations of recent Ropubllcan congress
es, which have kept taxes high and re
duced tho purchasing power of tho peo
ple's toil. Wo demand a return to that
simplicity nnd economy which befits n
democratic government and a reduction
in tho number of useless offices, the sal
aries of which drain tho substnnce of
the people."

Vote next Tuesday.
Remember thnt tho time your voto

Auto Club's Good Work.
(Burlington Freo Press.)
Lester H. Grcono of Montpollor, sec
rotary of tho Auto club of Vermont, is
doing splendid servlco in promoting
safety as well as convenience of travel.

TID3 SENATORSinP.
Nothing that The "Phoenix might say
in addition to what it already has said
concerning the senatorial fight would
bu much more thnn a repetition of the
arguments that hnvc appeared in these
columns. The closing days of the cam
paign which end next Tuesday are
marked by the usual charges and coun
ter charges, but thus far have been un
productive of important developments.
The issue is now stpiarely up to tho Re
publican voters of Vermont and it is
for tjiem to decide who is best quali
fied to be given tho nomination of
United States senator.
The Phoenix cannot believe thnt tho
choice will fall to Senntor Carroll a
Page. There is nothing about his rec
ord in Washington to warrant the
claim thnt he has been anything moro
than an ordinary ollico-holder. There
aro sovernl things about his record as
a Vermont banker that have not been
satisfactorily explained. Some of tho
strongest interests supporting him are
open to the suspicion of doing so less
because they have any faith in his
ability than because they do not want
any chnngc until they can have more
to say about it.
Tho campaign which Allen M. Fletch
er' has been making for the nomination
is characteristic of the man himself
hnrtl-hitting nnd uncompromising. It
lins cost him some money, to be sure,
but that money has been spent on
publicity of a strictly legitimate kind,
nnd ninny of the facts that -have been
uncovered by it are facts that it is
well for the peoplo of Vermont to
know. About the only arguments
against him are that ho is wealthy and
thnt as governor ho made many cno
mies. In the opinion of The Phoenix tho
former is more makeshift and the latter
a tribute to his independence. Mr.
Fletcher did- mako many enemies in tho
courso o? his term as governor, but ho
made thorn in trying to accomplish re
sults thnt he honestly believed were for
the best interests of the state as a
whole. No ono can truthfully say that
he docs not possess ability, courage and
integrity.
Governor Gates has been making lit
tle effort to forward his candidacy
much less, in fact," than many of his
friends had hoped ho wouldi make. His-'
strength . however, i8 -onsidorable, in'
eluding hundreds of voters who nre con
.viuccd thnt.it is- time' Senator Pago
was retired but nre personally opposed
.to Mr; I'lotcher As -Tho Phoenix has
stated on- Humorous provions occasions
it is only because it firmly believes thnt
Mr. Fletcher would mako n moro ablo
United States senntor that it favors his
nomination over that of Governor
Gates.
The Phoenix has been content to of
fer no ndvico to tho Republican voters
of Windham county in regnrd to their
choice of nominee for stnte senators.
All four of the candidates in tho field
are men of integrity and experience,
mid the interests of their constituents
will be in competent hnnds -whichever
two are nominated. In the case of
the state's attorneyship, however, we
nro convinced that custom should be
made a secondary consideration to
qualification, and that is why we be
lieve that tho nomination should go to
William R. Daley of Brattleboro rather
than to Osro H. Clayton of London
derry or Fred B. Pingreo of Rocking
ham. Mr. Daley is a lawyer of experi
ence and is particularly well fitted,, to
bo state's attorney for the renson thnt
ho served ono term in that-ofllce in Bon
nington county.

automobile, who is married and has
ueveral children, pleaded not guilty to
tho charge against him nnd was held
under the same bail for a hearing yes

Chase & Chase. After the girl had told
her story Judge Barber fixed bail at
$1,200, the heaviest lie lins ever im

Tho threatened strike of 400,000 mem
bers of the railway brotherhoods, which
would have tied up 228 steam roads of
the country was averted at tho end of

tho Vermont delegation voted ngaitlst
the measure, and Roprescntntivo Fralllc
L. Grceno of tho First district deliv
ered ono of the most effective speeches
against it. He told congress thut when
any body of men holds up congress and
threatens u national calamity it is time,
to fix the responsibility of those men
rather than yiold to them under duress.
