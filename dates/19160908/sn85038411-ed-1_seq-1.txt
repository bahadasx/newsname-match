Additional Railroad Legis

Signs Many Bills
By Associated Press
Washington, D. C., Sept. B.—Con
gress adjourned sine die this morning
at 10 o'clock, concluding a session,
record breaking in many respects, with
appropriations and- other authoriza
tions fo: the future running well to
ward two billion dollars.
In a statement issued following the
adjournment of Congress, President
Wilson called attention to the "help
ful and humane legislation" passed
and declared that while he regretted
additonal legislation dealing with the
recent dispute between the railroads
and their employes had not been com
pleted, he had every reason to believe
the question would be taken up imme
diately after Congress reassembled.
Called Remarkable Session
The President's statement follows:
"A very remarkable session of Con
gress has just closed, full, as all re
cent sessions of the Congress have
been, of helpful and humane legisla
tion which constitutes contributions of
capital importance to the defense, the
economic progress, and the wholesale
life of the country.
"It is to be regretted that the ses
sion should not have continued long
enough to complete the program re
cently projected with regard to the ac
commodation of labor disputes be
tween the railways and the employes,
but it was not feasible in the circum
stances to continue the session any
longer and therefore only the most
Immediately pressing parts of the pro
gram could be completed.
"The rest. It is agreed, has merely
been postponed until it can be more
maturely deliberated and perfected. I
have every reason to believe that it is
the purpose of the leaders of the two
houses immediately upon the reassem
bling of Congress to undertake this
additional legislation. It is evident
that the country should be relieved of
the anxiety which must have been
created by recent events with regard
to the future accommodation of such
disputes."
Most Extravagant
"The sixty-mourth Congress has
been superlative in several ways,"
said Senator Jacob H. Gallinger, min
ority leader of the Senate. "It has
been the most extravagant and the
most wasteful Congress in the nation's
history. It is doubtful whether any
Congress of the past can compare to it
In volume of useless and harmful leg
islation placed on the statute books.
No previous congress, perhaps, has
ever been so servile to the executive
will.

can speaker of the House: "In the
language of the Book of Common
Prayer: 'lt has done those things it
ought not to have done; and left un
done those things which it ought to
have done.' "

Missionary Sees Blonde
Eskimos Found in Arctic
by Murdered Explorer
Saskatoon, Sask., Sept. 8. The
tribe of blonde Eskimos which Harry
V. Radford, of New York, the mur
dered explorer, reported he had found
on Coronation Bluff, far in the Arctic
zone, have again been visited by a
white man. In a letter received to
day from the Rev. H. Girling, of Em
manuel College by the Rev. Dr. Car
penter, principal of the college, the
missionary announced he reached the
dwellers of the Arctic on October 10,
1915. He asserts that he is the first
white man tc dwell among the new
found people, who since their discovery
have constituted an ethnological mys
tery and formed the goal of unsuc
cessful expeditions.
The letter was dated last December
from "Camp Necessity," ten miles
from the blonde tribe, the first of
whom, the missionary said, he found
about ten miles east of Cochburn
Point.
Referring to the education of the
new people, Mr. Girling said that a
great deal already had been accom
plished in the direction of vocabulary
and grammar, the fair-skinned race
having only a dialectic difference from
the Mackenzie river Eskimos.

in-law later had hinted to him that
if he continued on that theory his wife
might seek other company. From that
j time on, the confession read, though

"attacks" or jealous fits, in one of
which hte cut the throat of his wife,
j and left her lying dead while he fled
j the house.
