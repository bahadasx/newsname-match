WORKMEN BEGAN WORK TODAY
TO LAY 6-INCH GAS LINE TO
NEW FOX GAS ArtEA. ABUN
DANCE OF FUEL Hi SIGHT.
The Ardmore City Gas company be
gan work today in the laying of the
six inch gas main from Oil City to
the Gypsy well at rox which is a
distance of 12 miles. A 3-inch line
has been laid to this well for some
months but Is was put in for the rea
son that Ardmore needed the supply
earlier than larger piping could be
gotten. Oil field supplies of all kinds
have been very scarce all year and
there w-as one time when many iwells
i were shut down because they could
not obtain casing. After a long de
lay in which Ardmore was taken care
of by smaller lines the pipe has ar
rived and is being laid under the
supervision of the company's field
superintendent, J. F. Lawrence. The
temporary line will be left where It is
so in case of a breas In the larger
line the smaller line could be used.
Ardmore people will without a
doubt have an abundance of gas this
winter. The gas company expects to
furnish every foot that Mill be re
quired and on cold mornings when
every stove is burnrng its capacity
there will be a suppry so plentiful
that the gas valves cannot be opened
and allowed to run without limita
tion. There are two sources of sup
ply for gas this winter. One source
is at Fox and the other source is In
section 15 In the Healdton field.
There is more gas being produced ln
section 15 this fall than there was
.
Jat this time last fall. Either one of
these sources will give Ardmore peo
ple all the gas they can possibly use.
The company already has a 6 Inch
'ire Into Healdton and will soon have
a 6 inch and a 3 inch Into Fox.
