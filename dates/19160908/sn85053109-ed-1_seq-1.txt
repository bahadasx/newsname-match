Two Dollars Per Year
Changes in Lineup
By Later Returns
Contest for Attorney and
Surveyor Close on
Final Count
Complete election returns
compiled at Choteau last week,
have changed the personnel of
both party tickets considerably.
It was generally supposed that
John Greene had easily defeat
ed Walter Verge for the dem
ocratic nomination for county
attorney, but complete un
official returns showed that
Verge had won out by about
ten votes. Bomboy was de
feated for coroner by Dr Hunter
of Valier by a few votes.
On the republican ticket
Mains gained ground at the laut
and defeated John W. Coburn
for representative by 36 votes.
The legislative ticket will be
McDonald and Mains. Paul
Jacobson beat Martine for
Clerk of court and John H.
Burnett won over Ward for
surveyor by three votes.
In spite of the many serious
defects of the primary law, the
republican voters of Teton
county selected a ticket that,
all in all, is a very strong one
one that could be improved
upon but little by deliberate
convention action. For county
treasurer one of the ablest and
cleanest men in Teton cqunty,
A. B. Guthrie, was setectpd by
an overwhelming vote. Dick
Dean for Sheriff was a good
choice. R. M. Hattersley for
county attorney, Paul Jacobson
for clerk of court, John Burnett
for surveyor, Frank Stufft for
commissioner, these were the
candidates who had contests
and the voters exercised good
discernment in selecting them.
Mains and McDonald will
make a good team as legislative
candidates and both will be
elected beyond a doubt. E. C.
Garrett had no opposition in his
own party for clerk and record
er. The voters of all parties
will see that he is kept in the
office he has so creditably lilled.
The threatened strike made it
necessary for the Great Falls
excursionists to northern Mon
tana to postpone their trip.
Secretary Britenstein has
written to the Pioneer Press
that the new date for their
visit here is Sept. 14th. Just
the right time to take the
visitors by auto through Head
light, to look over our incom
parable ha rvest.

Deplorable Accident
Last Friday evening as Mrs.
C. J. Norman of Fowler was
lighting a fire with kerosene
the oil exploded, setting fire to
the house and injuring Mrs.
Norman seriously. She was
taken to the Conrad hospital,
where she died Saturday. Mr.
Norman was able to save the
life of their infant child, but
before Mr«. Norman could be
rescued she was so badly burned
that her death resulted. Fun
eral services were held at Cut
Bank Sunday morning at ten
o'clock, from the Presbyterian
church.
Mr. Norman has the sympathy
of the entire community in his
bereavement, as he is well
known in this part of the
country, being a brother of
Geo. A. Norman of Ethridge.
He had resided at Fowler but a
few weeks, being employed as
deputy clerk of court at Shelby
before removing to Fowler,
Fine Flax Sample
Manager Pearson of the Conrad
Flax Fibre Co. declares that the
very finest sample of flax he
has ever seen came from the
ranch of James Bro wn on the
Blackfeet reservation, about
twenty five miles west of Cut
Bank. "Mi. Brown sent me a
sample of the flax, just ripening
recently and asked my opinion
of it. I think I know flax when
I see it, having visited every
flax zone of America and
Europe, and I must say that
this sample is the best I have
ever seen. If. the Blackfeet
reservation can raise flax like
that the land up there is price
less. I have sent the sample to
the head office at Great Falls."
Council Investigating
Next Monday evening the
Cut Bank council will take
action on the electric light
franchise, deferred from the
meeting of August 28th. Since
that date the Mayor and in
dividual members of the
council have been investigating
rates and other phases of the
matter and it is probable that
when the Monday meeting is
held a very intelligent idea of
the rates and workings of pri
vate systems in other places
will have been secured.
It is felt that whichev er of the
two applications is acted upon
it will only be justice to those
securing it to have the legal
regulations incident thereto, on
the part of the city, complied
with at the earliest date. It
takes time to construct such a
system, the days will be grow
ing shorter and work on the
power house and other outside
construction work would pro
ceed with more difficultv later
in the season. It is to be hoped,
for more than one reason that
the matter will be definitely
settled at the next council
meeting.
Teton County Republicans Meet,
Organize and Prepare for a Cleancut
and Vigorous Educational Campaign
Representative republicans
from all parts of Teton
county, recently elected as
precinct committeemen, met
at Conrad on Wednesday
and perfected an organiza
tion for the coming cam
paign.
J. H. Richey, mayor of
Conrad, and for years an
alert and energetic party
worker, was chosen chair
man of the county commit
tee and H. F. Se well, a
bright young Conrad lawyer,
was chosen secretary. Sam
Sollid, real estate broker and
high-voltage hustler, was
picked out to handle the
funds.
Plans for the county cam
paign were discussed in
roundtable t?.lks by different
members. The campaign as
mapped out will be on a
high plane, as declared in
the resolutions. The issues
upon which republicans seek
the suffrage of the electors
will be presented. The cam
paign will be waged with
vigor from now on. The
voters will be made more
familiar with what the party
has to present in the way
of a county ticket through
the medium of the county
newspapers. Speakers from
outside will assist local talent
in acquainting the voters
with national, state and
county issues.
The meeting was charged
with enthusiasm—not simu
lated enthusiasm, but the
genuine article; the epitome
of this feeling was "We Will
Win." It was the opinion
of all that the county ticket
is a particularly strong one, a
ticket that no consistent re
publican could justify him
self in "splitting."

Great Northern Grants Request for
Increased Service Between Havre
and Cut Bank-~Helps Great Falls
For somewhat more than a
year the transportation commit
tee of the Great Falls commer
cial club has been urging an
improvement in the local train
service from Shelby west.
General W. E. Hunt was able
to announce yesterday that
the Great Northern has decided
to grant this request which has
been -made upon several oc
casions. The new train service
will be brought about by an ex
tension of the local running
from Havre to Shelby. This
train will start from Havre at a
somewhat earlier hour and it
will run straight through to Cut
Bank, making a connection
with train No. 239 which leaves
Great Falls for Shelby at 7:30
in the morning.
This extension of train ser
vice will give additional ac

Resolutions:
We, the members of the Teton
i County Republican Committee, de
sire to reaffirm our fidelity in the
\ Grand Old Party of virile Ameri
| canism, the party that is pledged to
a policy of protection to home in
dustries. the protection of Ameri
can citizens on land and sea and a
diplomatic policy that will insure
the preservation of our prestige and
honor among the other nations of
the earth.
We felicitate the republican vo
ters of Montana for their wisdom
in selecting as a candidate for
United States Senator the Honor
able Charles N. Pray. During the
period of service of Mr. Pray in
the lower house of Congress he
was instrumental in having passed
some of the most beneficial legisla
tion that has been enacted since the
homesteading era began. We pledge
Mr. Pray our enthusiastic support,
also the nominees for Congress, Mr.
Farr and Miss Jeanette Rankin.
We commend the entire republi
i cau state ticket to the considera
I tion of the voters of Teton County
! and believe that its personnel will
compare more than favorably with
the ticket placed in nomination by
any other political party in this
campaign.
The Republican County Ticket
contains the names of men and
women residents of our county
whose capacity for service and in
tegrity are above reproach. We
respectfully ask the republican
electors of the county to give each
and every caudidate on the county
ticket his sincere support.
In conclusion, we assure the vo
ters of the county a campaign free
from petty personalities. We shall
seek to truthfully and candidly
present the issues of the campaign
upon a plane in keeping with the
traditions of the party to which we
proudly claim allegiance.

Parents and the School
"More than any other time
of the year the thought of school
and education come to the Core
during the first days of
September. Of course it does
not mean that these things are
forgotten during the rest of the
year; only that they demand
more of our attention. The
time when education was con
sidered a luxury has passed.
We consider it a crime to with
old from our child the things
that will be its most valuable
assets in later life."
Such were the thoughts em
bodied in a sermon delivered
last Sunday at St. Margaret's
Church, by Rev. Father Greven.
He exhorted the parents to do
their duty in this regard. He
laid special emphasis on the
duty of upholding the respect
for teachers, before the children
if the work of education shall
at all be successful. Nothing
tends more to undo their efforts
than the criticising of the
teachers' work or personal
characteristics before the
children. Parents, he said,
should cooperate with the
teachers in promoting regular
attendance, to begin at the
first day and to be continued
throughout the year. This co
operation should also extend
itself to the home work. Three
factors ought to work together
to make good citizens: The
home, church and school.
The school as far as the in
tellectual side is to be developed.
The church as far as the
moral side is to be developed.
The home advancing both by

Tendered Surprise
Mr. and Mrs. C. C. Dewing
were tendered a suprise on
Tuesday evening, when about
fifteen of their town friends,
who remembered that the above
date was their tenth wedding
anniversary, invaded their
home, laden with appropriate
gifts for the bride and groom of
ten years. After spending a
few hours in pleasant discourse
a luncheon was served and the
invaders took leave.
Anker's Discovery
Atty. Anker Torrison claims
to have discovered a specimen
of the Genius Humo who hasn't
heard of the Europeon war.
Anker was out near the bound
ary recently and stopped at a
farmhouse to inquire about the
roads or something. "Whats
the news?,' questioned the lord
and master of the ranch."
"Nothing much," quoth Anker.
"Heard that Rumania had join
ed the Allies in the war?"
"What war?" came the question.
"Why, the war of England,
France, Russia and a few
others against Germany and
Austria." "Didn't know a
thing about it." And scratch
ing his head and other man
ifestations of deep thought:
"Well, this is nice weather for
a war."
AGAIN a bounteous harvest has returned to our
community and the whole world is waiting to
be fed fron our "No. 1 Northern" and willing to
pay well for the privilege.
It is essential at such a time that you have con
nection with a bank where you can transact your fi
nancial matters and where your business will receive
courteous and welcome attention at all times.
We know the banking needs of our farmers and
have made every provision' to meet their require
ments most satisfactorily. We desire to be your
business friend, offer dependable advice and render
personal service under all circumstances.

Talks of Federal
Land Bank Law
Loan Commissioner Geo.
N orris Tells How
It Works
The plan to secure capital for
the use of the farmer under the
new r federal loan act was dis
cussed by George W. Norris,
loan commissioner, a member uf
the federal farm loan board,
who arrived here to attend the
meeting which will be held at
the federal building this even
ing at 7 o'clock for the purpose
of gathering information that
will be useful in determining
the location of one of the banks
in this district.
"Twelve federal land banks
will start with an aggregate cap
ital of no less than $9,000,000
immediately available tor
loans," said Mr. Norris. "After
any one bank has made loans
to the amount of $50,000, it will
be entitled, with the approval
of the farm loan board, to issue
$50,000 of federal loan bonds,
which will be secured primarily
by the assignment to and de
posit with a farm loan register
of a like amount of first farm
mortgages as collateral.
"These federal loan bonds
may be issued in the aggregate
to an amount equal to twenty
times the capital of the issuing
bank. Each of the 12 banks is
to be capitalized to the amount
of $750,000, so this provides for
at least $180,000,000 additional
loanable funds, subject only to
the condition the bonds shall
prove saleable.
"On its financial side the act
provides a much needed connec
tion between the money needs
of the farmer and the accumu
lated capital of the city. The
$9,000,000 which will be imme
diately available and the $180,
000,000 additional which will be
without increase of the original
capital stock of the banks, will
be only the beginning and there
is no reason to doubt that as the
system develops and the ad
vantages become known to
farmer and investor, many
hundreds of millions of capital
will be utilized in agricultural
development and extension, in
suring to the economic safety
and prosperity of the whole
country."—Helena Record.
