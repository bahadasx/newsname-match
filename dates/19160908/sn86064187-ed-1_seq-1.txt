The term begins next Monday.
Hundreds of children who lint
moved into the city during the summer
and other hundreds who have just
reached school age were among the
number. An accurate estimate of the
increase in school population Could not

More Change Chriitmat.
Not only will the initial enrolment

necessary further changes in school
plans, llundieds of children recently
moved to the city and becoming of
school age during the winter enroll at
that time.
High school enrolment has been un-
iler way all this week. Present rec
ords point to the highest enrolment in
the history of the city. High school
officials, who were barely able to strug
gle along with what space was at their
disposal last year, are wondering wher
thev ran place the newcomers now
Junior High School Idea.
Plans to convert the Irving building
into a junior high school, thus taking
awav part of the high school overflow,
have been discussed at various times
bv the board of education. I'.ien now
a committee is considering the mat
ter. Hut a satisfactory plan has neiec
been agreed upon and it is probable
that thr high si hool building only will
again be used all winter.
