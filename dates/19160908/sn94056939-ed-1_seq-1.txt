CARRIZOZO SCHOOL
OPENED MONDAY
Enrolment Far Exceeds That
of Any Previous Year;
Daily Attendance Near the
Four Hundred Mark
QUESTION OF ADEQUATE
ROOM URGENT PROBLEM
School opened Mondoy morning
with n record nttendnnco in ovo ry
department. Every indication
points to a daily attendance ap
proximating closely the four
hundred mark, when theso who
are usually a few days late in
getting suitable homes or board
ing places in Carrizozo got set
tled here and down to businees.
Each year sees the enrolment in
the schools far in excess of any
previous year, affording an im
pressive reminder of the rapid
growth of the town in the mat
ter of now families, usure index
!K)inting to substantiality.
The most apparent fact which
has como to the notice of
thoso directly connected with
school activities this week is the
problem of providing for the
seating of the pupils. Not only
was an unexpected number of
new students received, but the
enlarged scope of the work has
made the question of adequate
room a most urgent problem The
new primary room, the llrst unit
oi the new school building, is
being pushed to completion, and
this will partially solve tho prob
icm oi room, uvorything pos
sible is being done to próvido
fully for all phases of tho work,
but tho increased facilities barely
keep pace with tho growing de
mand for the enlargement of
the school plant and all its facil
ities. School spirit, both among fac
ulty and student body, was never
better. Great inconveniences
have been cheerfully tolerated in
time past and will be met with a
smile in tho future days. Such
phenomenal growth as has been
experienced in the student body
tho past three years, and espec
ially in tho enlargement of tho
high school, could not but have
entailed many irregularities.
Tho management has been nro-
grcssive, the patrons have shown
themselves loyal, pupils have
been true to their home school,
and the inevitable resulta of
such a delightful combination of
industry and good will has pro
duced a bountiful fruitage of
far-reaching results.
Thus the indispensable to pro
gress is abundantly present in
Carrizozo and its environs. Tho
problems of the futuro are real.
and cannot bo sidetracked, and
now is the lime for progressive
citizens men nnd women with a
vision to lay deep tho founda
tions of a school system wliiMi
shall fully commensurate with the
groator (Jarrizozo which is filling
up its vacant lots with now busC
worn houses and rosidoncos and
axporioncing a growth built upon
tho solid rock of poronnial pros
parity. Manager McQulllon is havin

ANNOUNCES FOR SCHOOL SUPT.
Mrs. Grace E. Do Nisson an
nounces in this week's Outlook
for Superintendent of Lincoln
County Schools and-will bo de
cidedly in tho race as her educa
tional qualifications aro excellent
and her successful teaching ex
perience has been ample. Mrs.
Do NÍBSon was graduated from
tho high schools of Lyons, County
Iowa, and immediately began the
work of teaching in tho rural
schools of that state. She then
attended the Normal Department
of tho Northern Illinois College,
Dixon, 111. which professional
training was supplemented with
a thorough course in business
nt tho Athenaeum, Chicago.
For tho past fi vo years -Mrs. De
Nisson has been actively engaged
in school work in Lincoln County.
She has given especial attention
to tho rural and ungraded school
work, has made a thoroughgoing
and serious study of tho many
problems connected with the ad
ministration of tho work in this
particular phase. Accordingly she
is thoroughly acquainted with the
needs and conditions of tho rural
schools in particular, and stands
ready to apply that solution of
situations which aro especially
problematical. Mrs. Do Nisson
asks for tho ofiico because she
feels qualified to render efficient
and painstaking service to nil
educational means in Lincoln
County,
CHOICE OF THE VOTERS
James V. Tulley is still running
Btrong for state senator from
this fifteenth senatoral district
of which Lincoln County is a
worthy member nnd is flu wish
ing a candidate whom his party
has chosen by unanimous vote
and who stands high in the esti
mation of the best people of tho
entire district. Mr. Tully will
do much credit to this oillce and
represent the people in an im
partial manner, championing the
caudcof his section when occasion
requires it, and voting for tho
general good whonovor opportun
ity is offered. One tiling which
continues to mako its appeal to
tho voters of this section is the
fact that Mr. Tulley is not a nov
ice nt the legislativo business
lie knows and understands tho
neees of tho country, both special
and gonoral. lias sorved as re
presentative in the first New
Mexico legislature, and has i
standing and reputation in gov
ornmental circles which will ac
cord him unusual prestige at
Santa Fo. Mr. Tully.s progroa
sivonoss and gonorosity in things
which make for civic improve
inont and community bottorment
aro too well known to admit of
extensive comment. He is allied
with the interests of thoso very
ones he seeks to represent in the
senate hall and cannot but nro
mote legislation which will be
constructive nnd based upon an
earnest desiro to servo the pres
ent ago. A vote for Tully means
a vote for constructive legislation,
nnd Ills election will undoubtedly
bo one of the most decisive con
nected with the events of Novem
ber seventh.
HOW ABOUT OUR
FALL FESTIVAL?
If Carrizozo is to Have a
Fall Festival as Has Been
The Custom, no Time is
to be Lost in Preparation
DATES OF THE BIG DOINGS
SHOULD BE SET IMMEDIATDLY
The timo is now about at hand
when Carrizozo progressive busi
ness men and loyal citizens
should bestir themselves in the
interest of tho annual field day
events. These big doings have
come to bo an actual part of our
existence as a town, nnd to neg
lect to mako proper preparation
n sufficient timo before to get
every detail properly arranged,
or to fail to add new features.
would bo to take a stride in the
backward direction n thing
which Carrizozo has never yet
been guilty of doing. In fnct
this everv-fall featuro in our
nrosnerous little citv has come to
be a feature of county-wide in
terest, and inquiries are being
made already as to tho dates
which will be provided for this
affair which attracts people from
every quarter for miles around.
The past neiu days nave proven
themselves more interesting and
mutually profitable each year of
their existence, as the many ad
vantages of Carrizozo as a trad
ing point aro convincingly shown
to those who do not know us as
well as others, and, in turn, now
friends arc made, closer relations
of mutual helpfulness establish
and a general good time is tho
result. And If an carly'dato in
uetouer is arranged, what a
political trysting spot for tho
candidates! Can wo aflbrd to
deny them this rare opportunity
to show us what a record they
havo made in their respective
ollices, or to convince the popu
lace that they would turn tho
world uns do down if thev could
only havo a look-in where n look-
in has thus far been donied them
Hut perhaps we should not havo
mentioned this feature, sinco
many will bo warned away from
a situation which may cot them
into a tight fix, but we'll tako a
chance on that score, so tho fore
going remains.
It has been recommended, and
ollleially enjoined, that no county
fairs bo held until after the Statu
Fair which comes early this year
This wo consider n fino arrange
ment, as many, if not all, of
tho products exhibited at this
great show, may bo given tho
opportunity to inspect the coun
ty a representative products at
their host. Indeed it is highly
probable that tho field day oxibit
may contain some oxcellont ex
hibits of farm produce which
may not bo matuered sufficiently
for exhibition at tho big show In
Albuquerque on account of tho
unusually early date set for the
Slato Fair this year.
Lot us got busy with this im
!ortnnt featuro, and make it by
far the best wo havo ever had.
Tho material is lmre in generous
supply. All we need is a bunch
of boosters to organize the forces
and plan the event and nut
those pinna into early execution.
Tho neonlo of tho countv nro
looking to us for a royal time,
and wo dare say that Carrizozo
will seo to it that thev nro not
only not disappointed but supris-
ed with two held days who
will bo hummers.
OHIO TROOPS PASS THRU
The First Uatillion of the Ohio
Corps, numbering one hundred
and fifty men. and nine ofTW
ccrs spent about two hours in
Carrizozo Wednesday afternoon,
lcavinir for thu Hordm- nlwint. ulv
o'clock. Tho division comprised
two enmnnnins. ihn Wfrnlriaa
Telegraph Company and tho
leiegrnth and Telephone Com
pany and their train was com
posed of fifteen conches. Tho
troops in question loft Columbus
Ohio, Saturday and were this
far on their long journey in fine
shapo and excellent spirits, with
not a man in the outfit sick.
During the wnit here opportunity
was aiiorucu lor manucvers and
First Lieutenant II. P. French of
Company A, a newspaper man,
took ndvantntro of tho onnortun-
!tv to n.iv tho Outlook n moKt
acceptable call.
THE BUSINESS LEACH
Mail order or "out-of-town"
buying has undoubtedly done
moro than any other ono thing
to retard tho growth of Carrizozo.
This disease has been undermin
ing our city for.nbout six years
and before its real progress has
been realized by the individuní
citizen we find something like 30
per cent of the entire retail busi
ness of tho city being hnndlcd
by mail-order houses in a few
largo cities.
Here is a condition that is most
appalling, Cnrrizozo merchants
carry tho accounts, pay the taxas,
keep up the roads nnd schools,
próvido n market, beautify your
city and the mail-order houses
get your cash.
When you send to tho mail
order houses you have to enclose
the cash for what you want.
It will not trust you. When you
do not havo the cauh to spare to
send to tho mail-order houses
you walk into the merchant's
store nnd a3k him for credit and
you get it. Every name that
the merchant put on his book
costs him money and yet lie is
willing to accomodate you by
waiting for you to pay. But tho
mail-order house don't do this.
You must send your money with
tho order.
The mail-order house is a busi
ness leach, sucking the cash out
of our community. Every dollar
you send out of New Moxico
makes us just ono dollar poorer
and onriclips tho othor state to
which you send it just one dollar.
Leave your monoy at home and
you will have moro to jingle in
your pocket,
Tho mail order house does not
pay ono contof taxes to Carrizozo
or Lincoln County, does not holp
to support our schools, roads or
churchos. In fact it tries by all
alluring ways to tako the tax
money away from us. So why
should we patronize it?
