WASHINGTON, July 1.?With the ad
journment of the House to-night over!
the Fourth of July, It became highly'
Improbable that the crisis between the
United States and the de facto govern
ment of Mexico would cmiic to a final
issue before Wednesday, at the earliest.1
Despite growing Impatience over
General Carrar.za's delay in complying
with demands that he state his Inten
tions toward American troops In Mex
ico, President Wilson made no move
to-day toward laying the s-ltuatlon be
fore Congress. There were no develop
ments to-day in the. diplomatic sltua
tion, although the War Department and
Congress still ground away on meas
ures of preparation for whatever the
future may hold
Under the \\';ir Department censor
ship, no Information General Funston
or the general staff may have as to
movements of Mexican troops beyond
the border was available. Humors said
Mexican forces were massing around
the strip of territory occupied by Gen
eral Pershing's men, leaving open only
the well-guarded road back to trie bor
der. These reports appear to be In line
with the decision General Carranza Is
said by private advices to have adopted.
It was predicted that he would re
affirm his intention to allow no opera
tions of the American forces on Mexi
can soil except toward the border.
BULLETINS GIYF.N Ot T
nV MOW MIMTAltY A III
A few bulletins, written in abrupt
military style, were given out during
the day by Secretary Raker's new mili
tary aid. Major MacArthur. They told
of the movement of various unnamed j
National Guard re. ,nts to the bor
der, of plans and regulations under'
which the regular officers would be as-'
signet1 to aid in the training of State
troops and of other matters connected
with the mobilization of 100,900 men to
re-cnforce General Funston's lines.
In Congress the Senate Military Com-I
mlttee prepared to Increase by probably i
moro than $100,000,000 the army appro-!
prlatlon bill as It passed the House, j
The committee now has approved in- j
creases totaling $75,000,000. It is ex- |
pected the S1S2.000.000 measure passed
by the House will reach a total of more
than $300,000,000 when reported to the
Senate.
In the House the Appropriation Com
mittee faced another .-ingle of the Mexi
can trouble. Secretary Lansing called
for an additional $300,000 to get Ameri
cans out of Mexico.
DESIRABLE FOR AMKHICAN
CITIZENS TO LllAVE MEXICO
"The conditions arc such at the pres
ent time," the secretary said in a
memorandum dated Juno 28, which ac
companied the estimate, "that, in my
opinion, it is highly desirable that
every American citizen should leave
Mexico at the earliest practicable mo
ment. The appropriation made hereto
fore by Congress for assisting Ameri- |
cans to leavo Mexico is exhausted, and
I urge that the amount above men
tioned be expedited as much as possi
ble."
From Secretary Bnker came hurry
estimates of $1,643,500 to meet emer
gencies on the border. The money Is i
needed to buy equipment for the Na- J
tional Guard, ranging from machlt^ j
guns to engineer implements. An Item
of $450,000 Is for the purchase of 250
.machine gnnR which were destined for
use on European battle fields, but hat'o
been diverted to American uses. A
supply of Illuminating grenades also is
desired for use In night fighting.

ditions at Camp Stuart Arc
CJreatly Improved.
The First Virginia Regiment, under
command of Colonel William J. Perry,
will leave Camp Henry Carter Stuart
for the Mexican border early Tuesday
morning, according to the best Infor
mation obtainable yesterday at the
office of the Adjutant-General, where
officials were loth to make definite
statements as to the probable move
merit of Virginia's war contingent.
Adjutant-General Sale stated, how
ever. that present plana are to have the
entire body of State troops rushed on
special trains to Brownsville, Tex., be
fore the end of this week. Later de
velopments may prove to be determin
ing factors in the course pursued by
those In charge of the situation. All
troops are ready for the order to begin
the southward movement.
The First Regiment will leave over
the Seaboard Air I.lne Railroad, en
training at the Fair Grounds, and go
ing straight through to the Texas desti
nation. Three trains will be required
for the movement, one In command of
the colonel, the other In charge of the
lieutenant-colonel and the third coin-:
manded by the senior major of the
regiment. Railroad officials estimate
seventy-six hours as running time to
Brownsville.

of action. Before the sun sets on
Saturday every physically fit man at
Camp Stuart will be either on the
Texas border or hastening on his way.
according to the present outlook.
Those who have failed to pass the Fed- '

duty may sound the call to arms at
any moment, will be left behind for
further practice in the arts of war.

Camp Henry C. Stuart will be left in
command of General Cecil C. Vaughan.
Jr.. who will have around him the same
staff to assist in the work of whipping
the leftovers into shape. Discipline
will be maintained, just as before, and
the regular routine of camp life will
not cease. Oflicers will continue with
renewed vigor the task of making sol
diers out of raw recruits. Preparations
to make the camp a permanent mobi
lization point will be prosecuted to
completion.
The two regiments and the troops to
follow them will go forth to the border
fully equipped for active service. With
the single exception of cots. Major
Allen Potts, camp quartermaster, had
on hand yesterday enough supplies to
completely fit out the unmounted por
tion of State troops. Uniforms, am
munition. rifles and ordnance have been
received from the War Department.
The State has purchased the necessary
supply of clothing, chargeable to the
Federal government.

Virginia's troops, in spirit, at least,
are ready for the call to action. In

The dull routine of camp life has not

[Special to The Times-Dispatch.? j
WASHINGTON. July 1.?The Senate
Committee on Military Affairs purposes
to put the question of actual prepared
ness squarely before Congress.
It was stated to-night. following- ad
journment of the committee, that $100,- j
000,000, and perhaps more, will bo]
added to the House army appropriation
bill, which carried I1S2,000.000.
The House allowed $4,500,300 for
small-arms ammunition: the Senate
committee has Increased It to $12,776,
000. For small-arms and machine-gun
target practice the Senate committee
increased the appropriation from 51,- |
200.000 to 53.4fM.00. The House appro
priation was $6.000,0'?0 for ordnanco
stores and supplies, including horses
for the cavalry, and the Senate com
mittee increased it to $1 1,000,000.
Another big increase was made in
the paragraph providing for automatic
machine puns. For this fighting ma
chine the House appropriated $2,000,000. 1
The Senate committee increased this to'
$0,i>SG.15>. For armored motor cars, ?
etc., the House allowed $300,000. The
Senate committee Increased this $1,145,- j
000.
I'nder the War Department's esti- (
mate, this will provide for 50 armored j
motor cars 200 shielded cycles with i
side cars. f?00 motorcycles with side j
cars for ammunition and 100 Individual !
motorcycles with side cars.
The Item of field artillery for the !
National Guard was increased from
$8,000,000 to $14,200,000, and the am-j
munition for the field artillery for the)
National Guard from $8,000,0)0 to
$14,000.,000

The committee takes the ground
that if the National Guard Is to be an
efficient arm of the service in time of
emergency, it must be properly
equipped. It is not, the committee
said, properly equipped and armed when
it has nothing approaching the neces- !
sary proportion of artillery and ammu
nition. This appropriation still leaves I
the artillery for the National Guard'
and the reserve ammunition far below I
the estimates of the War Department. :

line of any offensive vet undertaken on i

From .1 hill, the Associated Tress '
correspondent watched the beginning j
of the battle. For weeks he had wit- i
nessed preparation for the first con - I
siderable effort of the new British I
army. Notwithstanding the fact that
troops were moved to the front in im
mense numbers for the attack, there are
still remaining billet* in the rear which
apparently are unnecessary in working
out the present plans. With deliberate
and methodical precision the gathering
of human and mechanical material pro
ceeded. The whole line was included
in these preliminary bombardments l'op
the purpose of deceiving the Germans
as to the point of attack.
Overwheiminp as was the power of
the guns, the grim and significant spec
tacle was the sight of detachments of

SAX ANTONIO, July 1. While tho
War Department to-day was moving1
Into the frontier thousands of the na
tional guardsmen. General Obregon,
Carranza's Minister of War, was cn
gaged in strengthening his border
army. Minor changes were directed hy
him in his armies that now are quar
tered in force in almost all northern
cities except a few that lie "under the
American puns, according to informa
tion that readied the intelligence de
partment at Fort Sam Houston. No
clashes between Mexican and Amer
ican troops were rc-ported, hut indica
tions were that Mexican army officers
believed war practically inevitable.
One of General Pershing's aviators
investigated reports that Mexican
troops had been concentrated at Guz- j
man, and that they even had begun a!
march toward the American lines, lie j
flew over Guzman, which is rut of
General Pershing's line, and reported j
that the number of Mexican troops now'
there appeared not more than 'J.000, j
and that apparently no .^reparations
for an early move were 'being made, j
Strong forces have been distributed
along, lines paralleling his positions,
both on the cast and wfst. but General
Funston and his staff officers continued
to believe that Pershli g could take
