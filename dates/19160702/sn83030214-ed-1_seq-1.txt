Cleared Way.
(By Cable to The Tribune )
London, July 1.?Over a front of twenty-five mfles,
ing north and south of the Somme, and penetrating at one point
to a depth of ftvi miles, the firat tremendous blow of the Allies'
grand offensive on the West Front has been driven home.
Great as was General Brussiloff's blow in Galicia a month
ago. even it is insignificant compared with the British tidal
wave which this morning began moving toward Belfiun ind
the Rhine. ?
To-night its progress is still unchecked, and in the h:-nds
of the Allies Ue fifteen villages and the fortified towns of M ?
tauban and Mametz.
Labyrinth of Trenches Won.
In addition, a labyrinth of German trenches, simi!ar
those at F.ens. have been taken, extending over a front ol - rvetl
miles. with a depth of more than 1,000 yards. The terse stim
mary of to-day's events. as it is related in an ofllcisJ statement
given out ii. Paris to-night, follows:
"North and south of the Somme, following artiUery preps
ration and reconn.ussances carried out in the preceding days. the
Franco-British forces launched this morning an offensive m i
front of about forty kilometres (25 miles).
First Line Won on \\ hole Front.

along the entire front attacked the Allied troops gain^d DOaV
