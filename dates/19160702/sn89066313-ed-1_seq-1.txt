Association.

that the permanent home of the Un

Out-of-Door Players Repeat
Their Previous Successes
in Columbia.
The Coburn players pleased Colum
bia. "Better than ever," was the gen
eral verdict after the close of each
of their three performances here.
Mr. Coburn was at his best in the
part of Hamlet Friday night. His in
terpretation of the Prince of Den
mark, one of the greatest of Shakes
peare's character creations, is easily
one of the best on the stage today
certainly the best in out-of-door pro
ductions such as the Coburns give. He
has a splendid voice and his enuncia
tion is near perfection. The Ophelia
of Mrs. Coburn, different from many
interpretations of the part, was one of
the features.
John C. Hickey, who played Polonius
in the production of "Hamlet," was
the star in "The Rivals" at the Uni
versity Auditorium yesterday after
noon. His antics kept the audience
laughing and applauding most of the
time. Mrs. Coburn's acting, too, was
one of the bright spots. The play is
full of fun. It portrays London life
and manners of the eighteenth cen
tury. The company was again successful
in "The Merchant of Venice" last
night, always one of the most popular
of Shakespeare's plays. Mr. Coburn
as Shylock and Mrs. Coburn as Por
tia were especially strong.
The lighting effects were among the
features of the productions at the Col
umns. Xo inside production could
have made the ghost scene in "Ham
let" so realistic. One forgets there is
no scenery when the Coburns are act
ing. The plays seem better without
it. H. E. T.
Duke Parry Here on YlsiL
Duke X. Parry, a student in the
University last year and editor of
next year's Savitar, is here visiting
friends. Parry and Don Patterson,
also a student here last year, are do
ing reportorial work on the Kansas
City Star. Parry has recently been
made police reporter, and Patterson
has been given the job of keeping the
Missouri militia before the Kansas
City public eye.
Summer League flame Postponed.
The baseball game scheduled for
Friday between the All-Stars and the
Giants of the Summer Session League
was postponed. According to the
rules of the tournament, the game
must be played some time within a
week, as posted by the captain.

HEADQUARTERS BRITISH ARMY
IX FRAXCE, July l.ln the greatest
Allied offensive movement since the
Battle of the Marne, the British today
rolled back the Germans along a sixteen-mile
front for a depth of six
miles. The battle continues with the
greatest violence tonight. The towns
of Mamettz, Serre, Montauban and La
Boisselle are definitely known to have
been captured by the British. An un
confirmed report says that the strongly
fortified town of Frlcourt, an Impor
tant 'element in the German defense,
was captured this afternoon.
French Adrance Two Miles.
The French forces, co-operating
with the British, have captured the
Curlu and surrounding woods and the
Savier Woods. The French advance
late this afternoon was estimated at
more than two miles. The drive be
gan at 7:30 o'clock this morning along
the twenty-milo front in South Arras,
extending northeast and southeast of
Albert. All important gains so far
have been in this sector, but indica
tions are that the struggle Is spread
ing along the whole eighty-mile front
between the Yser and Somme rivers.
The British advance alone eclipses
any gain made by either side on the
western front in a single day since
trench warfare began. The British
losses are light considering the nature
of the offensive. The losses of the en
emy or the number of prisoners taken
cannot be estimated yet. In the en
gagement at Mamettz alone, 1,500 Ger
mans were made prisoners.
German Losses Are Heavy.
The advance is pushing forward
without a moment's lull. The Ger
mans sacrificed hundreds of men in
an attempt to recapture Montauban.
The British stopped the attack with
bayonets. The British were making
progress east of Montauban early to
night. The British attack was preceded by
an hour and a half of bombardment, In
which'the artillery of all caliber drop
ped a heavy rain of shells into the ad
vanced German positions. Precisely
at 7 a. m. the atack began.
The thing was beautifully timed,"
reported an officer. "The men left
their trenches all along the line and
started for the Boches like a great
crowd of runners in a race."
There was little fighting when the
advanced German trenches were
reached. The British guns, mean
while, were shrapnelling the German
reserves hurrying into action. Within
two hours sixteen miles of the first
line enemy trenches were in British
hands. The French meanwhile were
making gains, the full extent of which
are not officially reported.

HAVRE, France, July 1. The Bel
