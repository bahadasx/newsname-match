AMERICANS EVACUATE NAMIQUIPA
EL PASO, July 2. The border today is awaiting
tensely news that another punitive expedition has crossed
the line.
Troops sent from here and Fabens last night to Fort
Hancock to1 overtake and punish Mexican raiders, reached
the vicinity of the raid today, with orders to cross if. they
found a "hot trail."
The raiders drove off some horses early yesterday
morning, and were followed by a small detachment of the
Eighth Cavalry to the, river bank, where Lieutenant Hardy
declined to take responsibility and cross the line.
General Bell hastened two troops of cavalry from Fort
Bliss and another troop from Fabens and ordered the of
ficers to cross if they thought it would do any good.
Concern continued to be manifest among offaers to

These men report that General Pershing destroyed a
freat quantity of hay, oats, and camp equipment in falling
tck, because of lack of transportation to move it.
Carranza forces immediately occupied Namiquina
when the American forces gave it up.
The same Americans who bring details of the camp
evacuation also bring a report of trouble between a com
mand of Carranzistas and a small party of Americans under
Lieut. James Ord, Sixth Infantry.
They say Ord, in scouting, encountered a party of
Carranzistas, who roped and tied one of his guides. Ord, in
an effort to have the man released, parleyed with the Mexi
cans, who promised his release if the Americans would re
treat in the direction from which they came.
This the lieutenant did, according to report.
VILLA IN DURANGO.
lancho villa, with I.auo followers, is
In the state of Durango, near the border
of the state of Zacatecas, southwest ot
.Parrel, according to Information official
ly transmitted to the War Department
by an American who reached El rtiso
After a month's Individual expedition
after Villa.
The scout, who formerly was nn
orricer under villa, left the Namiquipa
base supposedly for the border early in
May.
He obtained 1500 in fold from the mili
tary authorities, and started south on a
man hunt alter the bandit villa.
Although he Is as familiar with Span
ish as with EngllJh, and resembles Mex
icans In appearance, the scout experi
enced some narrow escapes from death.
He reached Mexico City, he says, ob
tained conclusive evidence of harmoni
ous co-operation between the Vllltstas
and Carranzistas, and then started out
for the wilderness in the state of Du
rango, where Villa hail been persistently
reported.
The scout learned definitely regarding
Villa's hiding places, and on one occas
ion came within twenty miles of the
bandit leader's camp.
He learned that the bullet wound Villa
received was a flesh wound, which soon
healed. He also learned that all Ameri
cana were under Villa's ban and that
he would huve no opportunity to kill the
bandit unless It chanced to be by some
ruse.
In Juarez Last Friday.
The scout said that a week ago last
Friday Villa was In Juarez. It was on
the preceding night that Mayor Tom
Lea deportod Mrs. Villa, and on the day
that the emergency mobilization order
to prepare for field service was Issued
In El Pa no,
It Is now believed that the scout's
Information to the military authorities
regarding Villa was the reason for the
preparednese order.

Wiled by Bcrgeant J. K. Fair, of the
F.lghth Cavalry, near Ysleta, Friday.
Fair was Justified In the act, according
to a report made by Drlg. Gen. George
Bell, Jr., to Major Gen. Frederick Funs
ton. According to General Bell, the Mexi
can was conducting himself suspiciously,
as was his companion.
Protest Is being made to the State De
partment by Ellseo Arredondo, Mexican
ambassador-designate, who charges that
an American trooper fired on the two
Mexicans who were custom officers.
Mllltla from North and East poured
Into the Mexican border today. Thou
sands of State troops arrived between
noon yesterday and noon today, prepar
ing the border commanders for any
emergency that might arise.
Fear has been felt for several da &i
that the mllltla might not arrive here in
time to re-enforce the regulars In event
of a clash, but this morning General
Bell and other American commanders
along the border expressed satisfaction
that sufficient troops were now here

FRESH BOW RAID
Says He Has Ordered Investiga
tion and May Send Troops
Over Border.
An official report of a new border
raid near Fort Hancock, east of El
Paso, which threatened to cause the
entry of a new punitive expedition Into
Mexico was received by the War De
partment from General Funston today.
General Funston reported that Mexi
can raiders were said to have crossed
to the American side, recrossing the
nio Grande after committing depreda
tions. General Funston said lie had
ordered an Investigation.
An unofficial report said the raiders
had been pursued to the border by a de
tachment of the Eighth Cavalry under
Lieut. Edward N. Hardy, who dropped
the trail when It reached the river,
fearing to add anothor complexity to
the International situation unless derl
nltely Instructed to cross. Whether an
expedition will cross after the .Mexican
raiders depends upon the Investigation
General Funston has ordered.
The Mexican situation remained at a
standstill. No word was received from
Special Agent Rodgers or from Ambassador-designate
Arredondo with ref
erence! to Carranza's reply to the de
mands made In the note sent a '.veoit

Saved a Child.
The accident to Policeman Ippollto
when, on the morning or April 'a, ho
saved from possible death a cntld at
Seventh and F streets northwest
aroused the sympathy and Interest of
the entire city.
In running from his platform to warn
a little girl ho wo struck by the auto
mobile of Deputy Fire Chief D. F. Sul
livan, who was responding to an alarm
at Seventh and K streets northwest.
Suffering from a fractured skull and
Internal Injuries, he was removed to
the Emergency Hospital. For many
days his life was despaired of.
Gradually he began to Improve, and
on May 9 left the hospital and went to
his home at id M street nortncait.
Times Started Fund.
Immediately following the accident
The Times began tho collecting of a re
lief fund, heading It with a subscrip
tion of $25. Responses were prompt
and generous. Business and profes
sional men and employes of the Gov
ernment offered their subscriptions.
Ippollto does not share In the benefits
of the pension fund of the Police De
partment. Crossing policemen are on another
roll and are not accredited to the regu
lar department.
Relief for tho Injured policeman and
his family depended, therefore, on pub
lic subscription. It was soon evidenced
that this would not be lacking. Con
tributions sent to The Times In less
than ten weeks totaled more than the
policeman's salary for a year. Members
of the Police Department contributed
tso.
Among the many subscribers was
Commissioner Brownlow, who sent his
check for $10.
Contributions From Police.
The following contributions to the

London Hourly. Awaits News of Fall of
Fricourt, Where Germans Make
Stiff Resistance In Hand to
Hand Fighting
SIX STRATEGIC
Military Experts Declare Crescendo of
Offensive Has Not Really Been
Started by Allied Forces on
The Continent
LONDON, July 2. The great battle in France is
spreading north and south along the entrenched lines, and
all reports reaching London today declare that with the ex
ception of one in the vicinity of Gommecourt the smash
ing attack of the allied armies is steadily winning ground.
Fricourt has been the center of the most terrific fight
ing during the past twenty-four hours, and England is eager
ly awaiting the expected report that this village has been
captured.
All night long the exiraordinary artillery attack, which
has featured this latest drive of the allies, has continued,
and the rain of shells on the German positions in and around
this village assumed unprecedented proportions.
English troops have charged the German lines again
and again, and the brief reports reaching here indicate that
while much ground has been gained the Germans still hold
most of the village. Their retirement is felt here to be only
a matter of hours.
In the Montauban sector, where the English wedge
was driven deepest into the German lines, the allied troops
have gained more ground since yesterday and have taken
more prisoners.
Further south, the French have begun a tremendous
movement along the line at its point nearest Paris, and al
ready have gained some ground, while to the north the Eng
lish around Ypres today are attacking in force after a pre
liminary artillery attack which continued for twenty-four
hours. Some first line German trenches along a front of
five miles have been captured along with many prisoners.
Belgian forces in Flanders have also become active, and
have forced German retirements in a short section.
Up to this morning more than 5,500 prisoners have
passed through the English lines.
CAPTURED SIX CITIES.
The net result so far of Sir Douglas
Hate's first big move since taking over
the command of the British lines Is the '
breaking of tho German trenches to A
depth of more than seven miles and the
capturo of six strategical cities Ma
mei, Serre, Contalmajson, La Bolsclle,
Domplerrc, and - ay, with eleven for
tified villages.
This means that tho first line of Ger
man positions on tho entire front has
been shattered. The present offonslve
extends from Fay southeast of Bray to
ward tho northwest to Commecourt,
crossing tho Sammo and tho Ancre
rivers. .
The French, co-operojlng with the
British, are pushlnr the drlvo from tho
souhern end of tho line as far north as
Curlu, on he northern side of tho Mcuse.
Seek Two Centers.
The allies are aiming at tho possession
of tho two Important railway and high
way centers or Pcronno and Bapaume.
The spectacular drive, boforo which
even Bnislloff's vast effort In Bukawlna
nnd Gallcla pale In point of value, Is
continuing today In full swing toward
Belgium and tho Rhino. How far It will
go no man can tell.
In addition to the towns taken tho
British captured a labyrinth of German
trenches like thoso..nt Lens, extending
over a seven-mllo front and 3,000 feet
deep.
Not since the days ot Loos has such
progress been attained. The prepara
tion for the attack was heralded by
days of artillery fire, the fury of which
exceeds any Uko effort In the world's
history.
Million Shells a Day.
More than a million shells a day were
hurled Into tho German trenches for
five consecutive days.
Early yoaterday morning the "big
push' started. The town of Albert was
the starting point of one of the fiercest
thrusts, the British advancing from
east of the town of Montauban, five
miles away.

"In our opinion, it Is tho beginning
