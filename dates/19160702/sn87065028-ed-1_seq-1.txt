COLUMN OF SOLDIERS TWENTY
MILES LONG LOSES CONSID
ERABLE GROUND.
Telegraphic advices received here
late last night state that a column of
German soldiers twenty miles long
has been driven back a distance of
five miles at Verdun.
The news was received over the
cotton wire of the Postal Telegraph
Company, and is believed to be
thoroughly authentic, as this compa
ny never sends out any fake infor
mation. In forcing such a large body of
soldiers back a distance of five miles
thi Allies have gained another signal
victory, and the news was joyfully
nciived by the anJi-German element
not only in Columbus but through
out the country.

IMPORTANT MATTER TO
BE DISCUSSED BY CO
LUMBUS CITIZENS.
GATHERING SHOULD
BE WELL ATTENDED
Plan Submitted by Columbus
Railway, Ligrt & Power Co.
Will Be Discussed.
Every man who owns property or
conducts a mercantile establishment
in the business district should attend
the meeting which is to be held at the
Chamber of Commerce Monday at
11 o'clock for the purpose of discuss
ing the question of establishing a
White Way on Main and Markets
streets.
The movement looking toward the
estab'ishment of a White Way sys
tem in Columbus was inaugurated
somo time ago by Mr. J. G. Weathev
ly, the efficient secretary of the
Chamber of Commerce, and he has
secured from the management of the
Columbus Railway, Light & - Tower
Company a very liberal proposition
regarding the installation and main
tenance of the system. This proposi
t'on will be discussed in detail at the
meeting Monday morning, and the
advantages which merchants will
gain from the installation of the ser
vice will be thoroughly explained to
them by representatives of the com
pany. Columbus has been a little back
ward in establishing a White Way
system, and action In the matter
snould be no longer delayed. In order
to be up-to-date we should by all
means have a system of this ehar
aoter, and it is to be earnestly hoped
that at the meeting Monday morning
definite plans for its establishment
v.in b formulated.

COUNTRYMEN.
Mexico Ciy, July 1. The for
eign today issued a memorandum '.n
reply to Secretary Lansing's recent
note in which the correctness of the
assertions in the communication
from Washington were repeatedly
denied. The memorandum declares
that the United States hud no right
to maintain its armed forces on Am
erican soil.
Emphatically reiterating the Mex
ican government's position denying
the right of the United States to
keep armed bodies in Mexico, the
memorandum denies energetically
that ' the Mexican government has
protected bandits who had commit
ted depredations in the United
States and defies Washington to
produce proof of the assertion.
' The , memorandum, containing 35
counts, was not in form of a direct
reply to the Washington note, al
though it is considered equivalent to
an answer to that document. It ex
presses surprise that the Washington
government ahouW have been pained
at the tone and contents of the Car
ranza document, since it maintains
that the United States has Rent to
the Constitutional government not
only one but many discourteous
and even overbearing notes.

Charles Watson, general manager of
Cusihuiriachi Company; and Gen
eral Scott and General Funston are
accused of bad faith and lack of
honor in misleading General Obre
gon in an alleged evasive reply re
garding the crossing of troops into
Mexico after the Glenn Springs
raid.
The memorandum asserts that
while it is true that the United
States arrested Huerta, the motive
which prompted this act was not a
purpose of aiding the Constitution
alist government, but because the
United States feared that General
Heurta was plotting with Germany.
The note concludes by saying that
the presence of American troops in
Mexico invites rather than prevents
bandit raids along the border.
In part, the note is as follows: -.

The board of trustees having in
charge the three leading educational
institutions of the state, the Univer

the name of Mr. Hightower was not
presented to the board and that the

ftU R. t iLlSAPS DIES
IT HIS HOME IN JACKSON
WAS WELL KNOWN TO MANY
COLUMBIANS, WHO SINCERE.
LY REGRET HIS DEATH.
The death of Major R. W. Mill
saps, one of Mississippi's best known
financiers and philantropists, which
occurred at his home in Jackson, is
generally regretted throughout the
state and is a source of genuine
sorrow to many local citizens who
knew him personally. Major Mill
saps was for several years president
of the Montcagle Assembly, anil
numbered among bis friends many
Columbians who during the past
decades have summered there.
The following special from Jack
son gives a brief account of his life
and of what he has accomplished:
Major R. W. Millsaps, capitalist
and philanthropist, died at his home
here Wednesday night, aged K3
years. He was the best known finan
cier of the state and probably the
state's wealthiest citizen. Some 23
years ago Major Millsaps subscribed
$50,000 with which to establish
Millsaps College in this city, and his
total contributions to that institu
tion aggregate more than half a mil
lion dollars.
Major Millsaps was a Confederate
veteran, enlisting as a private in an
Arkunsas company. At the close of
the war won a colonel's commission,
but always preferred to be called
major, in which position he spent
most of his military career. Although
a lawyer by profession, at the end
of the war Major Millsaps engaged
in hauling cotton from Copiah and
Lincoln counties in Mississippi to
the Mississippi river and in this ca
pacity laid the foundation for hiH
large fortune.
At the time of his death Major
Millsaps had almost completely re
tired from active business connec
tions, but still retained interest in
probably a dozen of the largest fi
nancial inaitutions of the state, and
was at the head of the Mississippi
branch of the American Red Cross.
Major Millsaps leaves one daugh
ter, Mrs. G. P. Fitzhugh, of Merrr
phis, and Webster Buie, nephew, and
Mrs. Harry Austin, neice, of Jack
son. The two latter, although not le
gally adopted, were wards of Major
Millsaps.
the annual conclave, and will spend
one hour here.
The special train will arrive over
the Mobile and Ohio railroad at 11
o'clock Saturday morning, and local
Shriners are expected to be on hand
to meet and welcome their brethren,
each being requeued to wear his fez.
' The Shriners will be accompanied
by the Hamasa Temple band and pa
trol, and a drill will be given in the
business district while the delegation
remains here.

Baseball f;ns in both Columbus
and West Point will be able to enjoy
ball games Tuesday, July 4, one
game being played here at Lake Park
I in me morning, ami anoiner at esi
Point in the afternoon. The schedule
was arranged in order to have game
in both cities on that day.
West Point opens a series here
Monday afternoon and as both teams
have the same standing there will no
doubt be a large crowd out to nee
each game.
Two of the most exciting games of
the season were played here Thurs
day and Friday between Columbus
and Aberdeen, the locals winning
the first by a score of 3 to 2, and
losing the second by a score of 3 to
1. Stapleton's two-bagger in the sev
enth scoring Fuciih won the first
game for Columbus. In Friday's con
test neither team received but four
scattered hits. Neeley was on the
firing line for the Monroe county
players, while Trenchard pitched for
the locals.
Mr. John Humphries spent several
days the past week in Birmingham
on business.
CARRANZA DENIES BIGHT OF
D.S. TO
SAYS AMERICAN NOTES WERE
INSULTING AND OVER
BEARING. El Paso, Texas, July 1. Carran
za troops are still assembling in
forces of menacing proportions on
the south, east and west of Gen.
Pershing's main positions of F.l
Valle and Colonia Dublan. A Mexi
can column estimated at 2,000 men
is reported at Guzman on the east,
and just 40 miles south of Columbus.
A scouting party from Columbus
is at present trying to locate the
positions or a similar lorcc wnicti is
said to have clipped through the
pusses of the Sierra Mad re Moun
tains from Sonora. Namiquipa and
all positions to the south which have
been evacuated by the American
commander, have been garrisoned
and strongly fortified by the Mexi
cans. The sum of this situation is that
General Pershing has been forced
into a position where his little army
of 15,000 is likely to be attacked at
any time from three sides by a force
of not less than f0,000 men. If he
moves in any direction, except to
the north, as Carranza has directed,
he must fight.
These are not military secrets,
They are facts known to every intel
ligent Mexican on the border, and
they brag about the successful
.-.trutegy of General Trevino at ev
ery opportunity.
The Mexican commanders along
the border are convinced that there
is going to be war, and are making
active preparations for it
Throughout the northern states
there is a disposition to belittle the
j efforts of the first chief to prolong a
diplomatic controversy between
Washington and Mexico City.
At Nogales, Ariz., the Mexican
commander, General Norza Garayea,
was so eager to start the fighting
that he called upon the American
commander, Col. W. H. Sagae, to
make arrangements for the first bat
tle. The meeting was held in the
1 Mexican consulate on the American
'side of the border. Col. Sagae ad
' vised the Mexican officer to await in
structions from his government, say
ing he intended to follow such a
course unless fired upon from south

SOMETHING LIKE FORTY
LOCAL SOLDIERS FAIL
TO PASS.
LIEUT. G. H. EGGER
IS TRANSFERRED
F. M. Rushing of BUoxi Suc
ceeds Him in Office With
Columbus Riflemen.
According to reports made by lo
cal citizen who returned yesterday
from Jackson, about 40 members of
the Columbus Riflemen have failed
to stand the requisite physical exam
ination, and unless exceptions are
made in their favor by Uncle Sam,
they will not be permitted to ac
company the Mississippi troop to
the Mexican border. The Columbians
who visited the state capital were
Maj. B. A. Lincoln, Mr. C. H. Ter
rell and Mr. Julius Marx, and Mr.
Marx stated to a Commercial re
porter yesterday that most of
the boys who failed to pass the ex
amination were very much disap
pointed and hoped ultimately to be
accepted. Under the rules of the war
department the exemination papers
of those who failed to pass will be
submitted to the department heads
in Washington for final considera
tion, and the exceptions to be made
are up to these officials. In the event
that a declaration of war against
Mexico makes the demand for large
forces urgent it is believed that the
rules will be considerably relaxed
and that many who were tentative'
lo.'ected on account of some minor
llijsical defects will be finally ac
cepted. Mr. G. B. Egger, of Caledonia,
who 'eft here as first lieutenant of
the Cclumbus Riflemen, has leen
transferred to a similar position wit
a company made up of recruits noin1
different sections of the state, and
has been succeeded by Lieutenant F.
M. Pushing, of Biloxi.
Mr. Marx states that the health of
the Columbians at Jackson is good
and that they are all in fine spirits.
They are all anxious to proceed to
the border, but it is not yet known
just when the Mississippi troops will
receive orders to move forward.
