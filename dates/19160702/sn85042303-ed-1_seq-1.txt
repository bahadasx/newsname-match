sive and it is known that England has two million men ready
for this supreme effort to break the German battle line in the
"West
' At one o'clock, after six hours of fighting the British had
captured Serre, Montaunan and Laboisselle, while the Ger

British are making a fresh attack on the latter position.
There is an intense struggle for possession of Lontal JUai-
son, one end of which the British hold, with the uermans on
the other end.
The French, who are co-operating farther to the south,
have captured Curlu and Faivere Woods. "All of the main
German first line trenches are reported to have been taken,
while at some points the operations reached the main second
line.
The British have a strong position northwest of Theirval
and are attacking fiercely in an effort to surround it. An im
portant German position at Fricourt may be ot off.
The offensive launched by the Brit
ish army on the German front follows
a five-day battle, which in the amount
of ammunition expended and territory
involved, exceeds anything of the kind
previously known in this world war.

In England and France that the big
drive of the British was about to com
mence. With two million men iuny
equipped and trained in preparation
for this supreme effort. More than
6 million shells are said to have
Ven fired daily in the preliminary
bombardment, which extended over a
front of ninety miles. Berlin newspa
pers, however, declare this menace
was fully appreciated by the Germans
who hope to meet and crush it. The
allies are on the offensive now on
practically every front, the British of
fensive coming on the heels of the
great Russian campaign in Galicia.
The Slavs have driven the Austrians
fiack from Bukowina, while on the
Italian front the Teutonic armies have
met with severe reversals, the Ital
ians having driven the Austrians from
Trentlno. At the same time the
French defense of Verdun appears to
have strengthened.

JULY EIGHTH
APPROACH OF BUYING WEEK
MARKED WITH INTEREST
RAILROAD FARES TO BE RE
TURNED. Saturday, July S, is one day nearer
than it was yesterday. The days un
til the opening day of the week of
July 8 to 15 in Ardmore are being
counted by many. The proposition
of the merchants of Ardmore to pay
the fares of out-of-town customers
who come in to buy Ardmore goods
is spreading throughout the country
within a radius of fifty to one hundred
miles.
Sale Starts July 8.
The big sale beginning on July S
includes the merchandise of many
stores here. Detailed announcements
of the merchants will appear in a big
special of The Ardnioreite. The out-of-town
people who don't buy here
because the railroad rare brings tiio
cost up too high, will find tiie solution
of that barrier in this issue. The ex
act manner in whicn the fares will
be refunded and the advertisements
of the sales of the various stores will
occupy a large space .n this special.
The wares of Ardmore merchants
are familiar to those throughout this
section of the country, and this prop
osition by which the cost of getting
here is eliminated should hold an
appeal to every housewife who wants
the best goods without paying rail
road fare to get them.
The publicity of this special work
has spread all around. Ardmore citi
zens are sending marked copies to
their out-of-town friends and telling
them all about the proposition in
letters.
The most reasonable part of this
proposition now is the fact that the
out of town people must trade some
where, and why not Ardmore, when
the best merchandise and free trans
portation are considered why not
Ard more?
MOVING TO ARDMORE.
Fine Family of Lone Grove People
Purchased Home Here.
Dr. C. F. Sullivan who has resided
at Lone Grove for many years is
planning to make his home in Ard
more. He has purchased for $4,200
the Dick McLish Jr., home in the
southwest portion of the city and ex
pects to occupy it during the present
month. Dr. and Mrs. Sullivan have
a large family of children, some of
whom will be in the schools of this
city and some will be in the State
University the next school year. Dr.
Sullivan has not been actively enga
ged recently in the practice of medi
cine. He is among the few physici
ans who has earned enough money
to demand his attention in other di
rections. However he has been very
successful in the practice and it is
possible that he will take a post
graduate course and enter the active
practice in this city.

IMPORTANT ASSET
Growth of Local Building and Loan
Association.
There is no better Index to the
prosperity of a city man the growth
and prosperity of a well managed
building and loan association in that
city.
The report of the Peoples Building
and Lo in association of Ardmore, put)
lished elsewhere in this paper, speaks
volume's for the progressive spirit of
Ardmore. This association took on
new life a year ago. The total assets
of the association on June '.W, l!tli,
were less than $S,(i0t. The total as
sets today, one year later, are over
$S0,0()0. The authorized capital of
this association is $1,000,1100, over half
of which has already been subscribed.
There are now over 200 people in
vesting in the stock of this associa
tion. A great many of the new homes
that are being built in Ardmore are
being built through the Peoples
Building and Loan association. This
association has loaned over $(io,O00
during this last six months to people
who arc either buying, building or
improving their homes.
A building and loan association en
courages thrift, enabling the working
man and the salaried man, as well
as the professional man, to place a
part of his earnings each month in
absolutely gilt edge security that will
earn for him tlte highest rate of in
terest. This money is loaned to peo-
I pie desiring hemes, and' there Is no
thing that gives more stability to a
city than homo ownership.
A leading banker in a north Texas
town where their local building and
loan association has been operating
for twenty-five years, states unhesi
tatingly that he considers their local
building and loan association their
city's greatest and best asset.
CANNOT DISCHARGE GUARDSMEN
Governor of State Can Not Exercise
This Power After Federal Call.
Oklahoma City, July 1. The power
of the state executive to grant a dis
charge to a member of the national
guard after call by the president for
the militia tinder federal law has
been questioned in the case of a young
soldier in the cavalry troop from here.
This young man has a considerable
family who will probably be in neces
sitous circumstances if he goes to
war. In civil employment he is a
stenographer and earns good wages.
Representations were made to gov
ernor Williams and the governor
broke a rule he had made for himself
and granted a discharge. That was
several days ago. The young man
is still detained. With two others of
the same troop, he refused to take
the federal mustering oath and the
three were placed in the guard house
at Fort Sill, where they are held pris
oners. The case of the man whom
the governor sought to discharge has
been taken before General Funston,
but it seems that the discharge Is not
valid after the call.
