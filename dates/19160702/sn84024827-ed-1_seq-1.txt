MEXICANS MASSING
AROUND PERSHING
Senate Adds Another $100,
000,000 To House' Army
Bill; Lansing Wants Mon
ey To Aid Refugees
(By Review Leased Wire.)
' WASHINGTON. July 1. With the
adjournment of the House tonight over
the Fourth of July, it became h'hly
improbable that the crisis between the
X'nited States and the de facto govern
ment of Mexico would come to a head
before then.
Despite growing impatience over
General Carranza's delay In comply
ing with demands that he stfte his
intentions toward American troops in
Mexico. President Wilson made no
rove today toward laying the situa
tion before Congress. Officials believe
he will wait some days, at least, for
a reply to the note sent a week ago
tomorrow, provided there are no fur
ther attacks upon General Pershing's
men in the meantime.
Few More Days of Grace.
Before the de facto' government
had complied with the first demand
made in that note by releasing the
prsoners taken at Carrizal. it was
expected the President would act
within a time limit fixed, in his own ;
u.ind. if there was no reply or any
v.Esufferable act. -
The effect of the release order ap
parently has been to lengthen this
li-it. thoueh bow much only the
President himself knows.
Massing Around Pershing.
Under the war department censor
ship, information that General Funs
ton or the general staff may have as
to movements of Mexican troops be
yond the border was not available.
Rumors said Carranza forces were
massing around the strip of territory
occupied by General Pershing's men,
leaving open only the well guarded
, road back to the border.
The rumored movements of Mexican
troops, however, appear to be in line
with the policy General Carranza
see-rs to have adopted. It was pre
dicted that he would reaffirm his in
tention to allow no operations of the
American forces on Mexican soil, ex
cent toward the border
It was the order to this effect of
General Trevino. commanding in. Chi
huahua state, which gave the present
crisis its most ominous aspect.
Secretary Lansing has defined the
orrter as a hostile act and tersely
asked te de facto government if it
desired that it should be so construct
ed. On the answer to that inquiry
banes whatever action President Wil
son will take.
A few bulletins, written in abrupt
military stvle. were given out during
th dav bv S-cretarv Baker's new
military aide. Major MacArthui. They
told of the movement of various units
and unnamed cuard regiments to the
border, of plans and regulations under
wboeh regular officers would be as
signed to aid in the training of state
troops and of other matters connect
ed with the mobilization of 100,000
men to reinforce General Kunston's
lines.
$100,000,000 More for Army.
In Congress the Senate military
rommittee prepared to increase by
more than $100,000,000 the army ap
nropriat'on bill as it passed the
House. The committee now has ap
proved increases totalling $7S.onn,
000. It is expected that the $1S2,
000.000 reeasure passed by the House
win reach total of more than J300.
0o0.n0 when reported to the Senate.
$13,000,000 for Aviation.
-Among items added today were
$13,000,000 for the army aviation serv
ice.' includina provision for equipping
the 12 national guard aviation squad
rons: $1.543,4!mi fo rthe signal corps;

tillery and ammunition: $4,586,000 for
machine guns: $1,000,000 for armored
motor cars and $5,000,000 for ordnance
stores.
"We expect these figures will stag
ger some members of Congress," said
Senator Chamberlain, chairman of the
committee, "but we are going to put
the responsibility for adequate mili
tary preparedness squarely upon Con
gress. The national guard, aa has
been demonstrated in the last few
days, needs equipment. We are going

according to a report made to General
Uell by an American scout who reach
ed the border today after a month's
individual pursuit of the ban'dit chief
fain. The scout. . who formerly was
one of Villa's officers, undertook the
quest in the hope of obtaining rewards
offered for Villa's capture. His report,
however, conflicted with previous re
ports that Villa is at Koquiilas, 70
miles west of Chihuahua City.
The scout said he once was within
20 miles of the outlaw's camp. When
he reached here he was suffering
Irom wounds inflicted in the city of
Zacatecas by Mexicans he recognized
as having formerly been in Villa's
army.
He escaped then, he said, through
the aid of friendly natives.
The American's reports supported
rumors current here that Villa was in
Juarez a week ai:o yesterday. He said
that Mexiansc in Chihuahua City told
him that this was true. The scout
added that he had discovered numer
ous evidences that the breach be
tween the Villistas and the Carran
cistas is rapidly being healed.
