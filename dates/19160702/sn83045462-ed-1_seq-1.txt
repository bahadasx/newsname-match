A definite statement of iust
how tight the tension has become
between United States soldiers
and Carranza troops on the Mexican
border was sent to Washington
late last night by Gen.
Funston. in a telegram reporting
the shooting of a Mexican customs
inspector and a companion
at Ysleta, Tex., by an American
* ? it .t _ J
cavalryman, ana. wnue me aajournment
of the House of Representatives
over the Fourth of
July made it highly improbable
that the crisis between the two
governments will come to a final
issue before Wednesday, officials
here grow more and more pessimistic
as each new border affray
is reported.
The telegram from Gen. Funi
ston quoted Gen. Rell as saying,
in connection with the Ysleta incident
:
"Mexicans have frequently
fired upon parties on this side,
and the American soldier has reason
to put no faith' in an armed
man who acts suspiciously on the
opposite bank
Much Depends on Carranza.
Gen. Funstcn says in his own report
on this case:
"It is easy to understand conditions
existing along the border and the possibility
of our men being killed when
armed Mexicans threaten to shoot at j
mem
This condition of high-?*rung tension
was the outstanding feature in the
Mexican situation last right. both in
Washington and or. the border. Despite
growing impatience over Gen. <*arranzn's
delay in complying with United
States demands that he state his intentions
toward American troops in
Mexico under Gen. Pershing. President
Wilson made no move yesterday toward
laying the situation before Congress.
Officials believe that the tension
will continue for several days, and j
that the President will wait for a reply
to the note sent a week ago today,
provided there are no further attacks
upon Gen. Pershing's small forces by
the large bodies of CTarranza troops
around him in Mexico in the meantime.
Information as to movements of
Mexican troops beyond the border in j
the possession of Gen. Funston and
the general staff was unavailable yesterday,
owing to th^ new War Department
censorship. Rumors that the
Mexican forces are massing around the
strip of territory heid by Gen. Perehir.g's
men were In circulation, but
while War Department officials refused
to discuss tliem. it is known that thev
are fully confident of Gen. Pershing's
ability to protect himself under any i
circumstances
Expected to Reaffirm Orders.
The rumored movement of Mexican
iroops. nowever, appears to be in line
with the decision ('.en. Carranza is said
by private dispatches to have adopted.
It is predicted that he will reaffirm his
intention to allow no operations of
American forces on Mexican soil, except
toward the border. In the reply to
the United States note he is reported to
be preparing. It was the order to this
effect to Gen. Trevlno. commanding in
Chihuahua state, which gave the present
crisis its most ominous aspect, and
which Secretary l,ansing, in his demand*
on Carranza a week ago, defined as a \
hostile act, tersely asking the defacto 1
government if the order should be so i
construed.
On the answer to this inquiry de- '
pends whatever action 1'resident Wilson I
is to take. There were no developments |
in the diplomatic end of the S'tuaMonj

UPON SECRETARY OF WAR
Frovides Official Shall Designate Dependent
Families of National
Guardsmen to Receive Aid.
Two million dollars for the relief of
dependent families of national guardsmen
is provided In the Hay bill, which
passed the House yesterday by a vote
; of 279 to 2, the dissenters being Representative
James of Michigan ,and Representative
Small of North Carolina.
The measure puts the sole responsibility
for the fund and its administration
in the hands of the Secretary of
War. He will designate what families
shall receive this aid. and from his decision
there shall be no appeal. The
bill specified a maximum of $50 a
month for each family.
Before the bill was taken un for consideration
Representative Garland Dupre
endeavored to swing the parliamentary
situation in such a way that
a separate vote might be taken on the
proposition to excuse from service
auardsmen whose families needed them
The New Orleans representative was
unsuccessful in this, but managed to
express himself forcibly in favor of
writing into the bill some method by
which guardsmen whose families suffer
because of their service in the regular
forces could retire from the service
As the matter nuw
cording to a letter received by Representative
Dupre from- Adjt. Gen. McCain.
there is no way for guardsmen to
get out of the service. The exemption
proposition was Introduced in the Senate.
but was never before the House.
Two Members Clash.
The debate on the Hay bill was brief
and unimportant except for the clash
between two members of the North
Carolina delegation, Representatives
Stedman and Small. The latter member.
one of the two voting against the
measure, made a vigorous speech
against it. saying in part:
"Now that we have this question concretely
presented in a separate bill, I
feel free to voice my opposition to it
and to express the reasons which actuate
me. I realize full well the floe
sentiment behind the members of this
House in favor of this bill. I realize
the ^force of their appeal to
patriotism; but I insist, whether I am
right or wrong;, that we should also
appeal to the cool, sober judgment of
ourselves and of the American people,
and. that this bill is not in the interest
of real patriotism.
"This bill involves an unwarranted
and unnecessary expenditure. No man
ran prophesy the amount that will be
ultimately involved in it. even as applicable
to the National Guard. In the
debate at the other end of the Capitol
it v.as said that from 10 to 25 per
cent of the members of the guard would
make application under such a law for
the support of their families. If you
pay 10 per rent, 10,000 out of the 100,000
men that it is supposed the National
Guard will furnish, you have $6,000,000
annually required for the support of
their families under the provisions of
surh a law. When the bill was originally
here, $1,000,000 was sought to be
appropriated. Now, for some reason
not explained by the committee, it has
been increased to $2,^00,000. I ask in
all sincerity, why has it been increased?
What is the basis upon which
the increase is made? And can any
member say that the amount named in
this bill is sufficient for the purpose?"
Speaks for Regular Army.
Chairman Hay of the military affairs
committee said that $2,000,000 would be
sufficient until the next session of Congress.
Representative Small then called
attention to the fact that no similar
legislation has been considered for the
regular army;
"The result of any such legislation
at this time," said \Mr. Small, "would
be the demoralization and disorganization
of the regular army. Some weeks
ago we passed a bill increasing the
regular army by 20,000 men, calling
for volunteers to enlist. It has been
stated that up to this time less than
12,000 of the 20.000 men asked for have
enlisted, although strenuous efforts
have been made to secure them. Why
vt as it? I insist that such legislation
as this will not have a tendency to
create an attitude of mind upon the
part of our citizens to enlist in the
regular army and that it will increase
manv fold the difficulties of securing
sufficient enlistment to make up the
larger army which lias been authorized
?n the national guard defense act.
This lull.does not provide for volunteers.
Gentlemen may say 'if volun
teers are necessary, we will meet that
question when we reach it;' but I. contend
that it ought to be reached now,
that this is the time to perfect such
legislation as will be applicable to
every phase of this necessity which is
said to exist, and which undoubtedly In
time of war will exist."
Calls Law Inconsistent.
"Here is another Illustration of the
Inconsistency of this proposed lew:
If a member of the guard surrenders
his life in the service of his country
then they are relegated to the general
pension law. and I understand the
maximum amount which the family
can receive under such circumstances
is 812 p*r month.
"This legislation has not been requested
by the National Guard, although
the National Guard have been
neither timid nor modest In asking for
legislation which they desired of Congress.
They were In evidence when
we were framing the national defense
act. and i was in sympathy with them:
but they made known their wishes at
; that time, and I take it if any such
exigency existed as would make the
: law necessary members would have
been besieged and there would have
been evidence that some demand existed
on the part of the National Guard
for legislation such as this.
"The theory of this bill is based on
compensation for service. I say deliberately.
based on the glorious history
of our past and of every other
country who has stood by the flag of
that country, that compensation and
patriotism do not go together. In the
great civil war. so far as the south
was concerned, men upon both sides,
bound to the highest principles which
actuated the soldier of thf south, men
on both sides admit the high patriotism
which actuated those who fought
for the preservation of the Union.
That wi'.s patriotism with no thought
of compensation behind It. In every
war which we have fought the men
who stood by the flag and who exemplifcd
the courage and high type of

SAN ANTONIO, Tex., July 1.
?While the War Department today
was moving into the frontier
thousands of the national
guardsmen, Gen. Obregon, t'arranza's
minister of war, was engaged
in strengthening his border
army. Minor changes were
directed by him in his armies
that now are quartered in force
in almost all the northern cities,
except a few that lie tinder the
American guns, according to information
that reached the intelligence
department at Fort Sam
Houston.
It was another day without
news of any clashes between
Mexican and American troops
that face each other across the
line, hut almost all information
obtainable indicated that Mexican
army officers were convinced
that war was practically inevitable.
Mexicans Concentrated at Guzman.
One of Gen. Pershing's aviators investigated
reports that Mexican troops had
been concentrated at Guzman, and that
they even had begun a march toward tho
American lines, but this report showed
the improbability of immediate action
from that quarter. Hi? flew over Guzman,
which is east of the line Gen.
Pershing has established, and reported
that the number of Mexican troops now
there appeared not more than 2.000, and
that apparently no operations for an
early move were being made. Strong
forces have been distributed along lines
paralleling his positions, both on the
east and west, but Gen. Funston and his
staff officers continued to believe that
Pershing could take care of himself if
the Mexicans did begin to close in.
Increased caution was displayed at
army headquarters today to keep secret
the movement toward the border of the
National Guardsmen. Agents of the Department
of Justice were working in
close touch wit!) the military In efforts
to learn of any plot to Interfere with the
movement of trains, and soldier guards
watched the bridges along the railroads
that stretch through the southern part
of Texas. Every guard carried an unusual
amount of ammunition, and the
orders that had been given were definite
and drastic.
By the end of the week those in charge
of the mobilization believe that it will
be almost completed. Without hitch and
without having interfered with the regular
traffic, the American railways were
moving the trains to their destination,
and reports to the quartermaster depart- j
rnent indicated the likelihood that there |
would be no congestion in the traffic. j
1st Illinois First in Camp.
The 1st Illinois was the first regiment
to go into camp here, and it was expected
that by tomorrow the 2d and 7th, completing
the 1st Brigade, commanded by
Gen. P. J. Foster, would be here. The
7th, 71st and 14th New York Infantry
passed through San Antonio today on
the way to the Brownsville district. Other
New York regiments will pass through
tonight, and army officers believe that by
Wednesday or Thursday the New York
movement will be completed.
The New York division headquarters
will be at McAUen, where auxiliary troops
and the 2d Brigade, made up of the 7th,
12th and 71st regiments, will be stationed.
The 1st Brigade, comprising the
1st, 2d and 14th Infantry, will be at Mission.
and the 3d Brigade, comprised of
the 3d. 69th and 74th Infantry, at Pharr.
With the exception of a part of the 7th
Now York and a battalion of Utah artillery.
none of the guardsmen actually
have reached stations on the border.
Enthusiastic members of the guards
made the most of their stops in San Antonio
today while waiting for trains to
roncfArraH trim nna railroad to an-<
other. They inspected the historic Alamo,
crowded the hotels for baths and gazed
curiously at Mexicans, occasionally encountered.
meanwhile referring to San
Antonio as a part of "the front."
Out at the camp where the 1st Illinois
had been sent the faces of those who
have not become accustomed to the
daily heat of approximately 100 degrees
were burned a bright red by the
blazing sun. Officers were working hard
to get the camp in shape, while regular
army officers appeared from time to
time to offer suggestions and assistance.

THE
MR.HUGHE.SIS RESTING
AS HE PLANS CAMPAIGN
Republican Nominee for President
on His First Real Vacation
in Ten Years.
BR I DOE HA M rTUN, >. Y.f July 1.7?;
Charles E. Hughes, the republican presidential
nominee, here on his first real
vacation in ten years, spent today in
true vacation style. He golfed a little,
motored a little and devoted the remainder
of the day just to walking
about.
Mr. Hughes had few callers today. To
those who saw him the nominee made
plain his intention of spending all the
time he could before the campaign in
relaxation and recreation. Preliminary
work will be concentrated so far as
it can be into two or three days a
week, whiah he will spend in NewYork.
Campaign Begins in August.
The actual campaign probably will
begin the latter part of August. By
that time Mr. Hughes expects to be in
fine physical condition and to have determined
the details of his plan of 1
procedure. He will go into the cam-i
paign, he told callers today, equipped
with all the facts and figures he intends
to use up to its end, with not
only the immediate steps in mind, but
with his entire program mapped out
in all Its essentials through to election
day.
In framing his speech of acceptance,
on which he worked for a time today,
Mr. Hughes has at his disposal the
views of virtually all the chief party
leaders and progressives with whom
he has conferred since his nomination.
Suggestions Jotted Down.
Suggestions from Roosevelt, Taft,
Root, WickTsham and many others,
jotted down by the nominee while they
w^e fresh in mind, have been placed'
in a bulging portfolio for use. They
will be consulted and from selections
which he makes Mr. Hughes will frame
his speech, adapting them to his own
ideas.
Mrs. Hughes, to whom the former
governor has repeatedly referred as
"my chief adviser," Is aiding her husband,
and several minor suggestions
of hers were embodied in that part of
the first draft of the speech which he
completed today. When it is completed
she will be the first to hear it
delivered?an audience of one.
FORBIDDEN TO PRACTICE.
Lawyer for I. W. W. Leader Executed
for Murder Disbarred.
SALT LAKE. July 1.?The Utah Supreme
Court, in an unanimous opinion |
handed down today, disbarred O. N. Hil- 1
ton of Denver from practice in the courts j
of Utah.
Hilton was chief counsel for Josoph
Hlllstrom, the Industrial Worker of the
World leader, who was executed here on
November 19 for the murder of J. G.
Morrison and his son. Charges against
Hilton were pressed by the Utah Bar
Association on remarks made by Hilton
at Hillstrom's funeral in Chicago a few
days after the execution.
The supreme court holds that Hilton's
charges of Mormon Church influence in
the courts of Utah are without basis in
fact, and constitute a vilification of the
church as well as unprofessional conduct
by Hilton. All members of the supreme
court are non-Mormons.

NATIONAL PARKSERVICE
BILL PASSED BY HOUSE
Creates Bureau in Department of Interior
to Have Reservations and
Monuments in Its Charge.
A bill introduced by Representative
Kent of California to create a national
park service, with a comprehensive
system of supervision, passed the House
yesterday afternoon. It creates a
bureau in the Department of the Interior,
with headquarters in this city,
to have in charge the existing national
parks and those to be established by
Congress, and also the monuments
iow under the jurisdiction of the Interior
Department. The purpose of
the bureau, as outlined in the bill, is:
"The service thus established shall
promote and regulate the use of the
rederal areas known as national parks,
nonuments and reservations by such
neans as conform to the fundamental
aurpose of said parks, monuments and
-eservations. which purpose is to conserve
the scenery and natural and historic
objects and the wild life therein,
ind to provide for the enjoyment of
he same in such manner and by such
neans a's will leave them unimpaired
'or the enjoyment of futtlre generaions."
First Proposed in 1910.
Such a park service was proposed by
he American Civic Association in 1910,
vhen the first bill for the purpose was
ntrodueed in Congress. Richard B.
kVatrous, secretary of the association,
speaking of the action taken by the
louse yesterday, said:
"It begins to look as if the movement
ve have been leading for years for the
jreater usefulness of the national parks

People are coming to realize that they

scenic grandeur, but that it is in their
iwn country. And the United States
vi 11 benefit in an economic way by atracting
for American tourist travel the '
lundreds of millions of dollars that
lave been going abroad for travel alone.
But that is a by-product?the great
'alue of the parks is their recreational

Fricourt, three miles east of Albert,
was still in German possession late tonight,
but with the capture of Montauban
and Mametz, to the east and southeast
of it, and La Boissclls, to the northeast,
the place was nearly surrounded
and its speedy surrender seemed inevitable.
The entente allied drive was begun
against German trenches leveled after
a seven-day bombardment, in which
more than 1,000,000 shots daily had
been fired.
The progress of the battle has been
marked by steadily increasing intensity.
North of the River Ancre it has
been particularly severe. The enemy i
in several villages offered a strenuous
resistance, but the gallantry of the
British troops resulted in their gradu"ii

points. A German counter attack on
Montauban has been successfully repulsed.
The number of prisoners so far
taken in this region is about 1,500. The I
record naturally is incomplete and
other prisoners are being brought in.
The operations are being favored by
fine weather.
Long: Action Promised.
At 6 o'clock tonight the British were
around Gommecourt and BeaumontHamel,
and fighting at this time was
continuing determinedly, the first stage
of what promised to be a long action
developing.
Among the troops opposite the
British, it has been found, were the
Prussian guard reserve division, which
fought at Loos and Neuve Chappelle.
The struggle over the longest line
of any offensive yet undertaken on the
western front began at 7:30 o'clock this
morning, under a pall of shell smoke
with the unbroken roar of artillery.
From a hill the Associated Press
correspondent watched the beginning
of the battle. For weeks he had witoessed
preparation for the first considerable
effort of the new British
irmy. Notwithstanding the fact that
:roops were moved to the front in immense
numbers for the attack, there
ire still remaining billets in the rear
which apparently are unnecessary in
working out the present plans.
With deliberate and methodical nr*.
cision the gathering of human and mechanical
material proceeded. The
whole line was included in the preiminary
bombardment for the purpose
jf deceiving the Germans as to the

"But it is in the contract," said a
young Englishman. "It is what we
expected. It is our turn to make
good."
Air of Expectancy Everywhere.
As the days of the bombardment
passed the air of expectancy was j
noticeable everywhere through the
army. Last night the word was pass*
ed that the infantry was to make the
assult this morning. At dawn the
correspondent ascended a hill in the
region of Albert. The sun rose brilliantly,
promising another fine uay.
This was even more welcome than
yesterday to artillery observers, who
must move the guns and carry forward
.the fire to protect the infantry adI
vance. On the average clear day,
from a point of view in front of the
valley of the Ancre river, both the German
and the French trenches are visible.
Ridges and hills, rich farming
lands and numerous villages roll away
to the eastward.
Somme, where the French are co-operating
wfth the British, is the theater
of the most extensive action of any
yet begun on the western front, and
which the entente allies hope may
prove the first stage in the turning of
the tide against the Germans. Every ,
one of the villages within the r'atige
of vision will be fought over, as were
those in front of Verdun.
Ouns in Chorus of Blasts.
But this morning something mora
than a mist was rising from the dewladen
fields and hid the landscape.
From 6 o'clock to 7:30 all the guna
along the front were for the first time
firing their fastest in a chorus of final
blasts, cutting wires and demolishing
trenches. The rapid fire of smallcaliber
weapons resulted in a continuous
roll, while only the guns of big
caliber, with their heavier reports
abov^ the monotone, had perceptible
intervals between the blasts.
The trenches were hidden by a curtain
of smoke punctured with vicious
flanhPR Tnwnrrl that rlniH whioh
shrouded every form of destruction
within the power of man. the reserves
were moving forward. Far shove the
observation balloons, motionless in the
still air, a squadron of aeroplanes was
seen flying: to its work, spotting: targets
for the artillery. j
Men Leap the Parapets.
At 7:20 o'clock the rapid-fire trench
mortars added their shells to the
deluge pouring upon the first-line German
trenches. After ten minutes of
this, at 7:30 o'clock, the guns lifted
their fire to the second line of German
trenches, as if they were answering to
the pressure of a single button, and
the men of the new British armyleaped
over their parapets and rushed
toward the wreckage the guns and
mortars had wrought. Even close at
hand they were visible only a moment
before being hidden by the smoke of
the German shell curtain over which
all remained of the trenches. Germans
had to yield to "two years of our preparedness
against forty for the Germans."

Nothing! was now to be seen from the
