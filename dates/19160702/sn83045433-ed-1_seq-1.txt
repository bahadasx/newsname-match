British Headquarters in France,
July i.-The British today launched
their long-expected offensive, and by
night, with the co-operation of the
French, they had pierced the Ger
man line on a five-mile front, had
penetrated to a depth of more than
five miles, and had captured four
towns and two woods behind the
German lines.
The towns of Serre, Montaubon,
La Boiselle and Mametz fell in the
order named before the British at
tack, while the French were clearing
the'woods of Curla and Faviere, on
the British right.
Frieourt Surrounded.
At the hour of filing this dispatch the
British also had surrounded the town of
Beaumonthamel. while they had almost
completed a circle of steel about the Im
portant German base of Fricourt, which
was the immediate objective of the drive.
The villages of Ovillers and Thlepval
were under attack, while in the streets of
Contalmaison. British and Germans, each
holding one side of the town. were fight
ing for its possession. Gommocourt saiu
ent Is straddled by the British. who are
presing with great energy tem both
ides. -
The sector in which the German line
was broken lies in the angle of the
Somme and the Ancre rivers. The line
from which the British and French ad
vance stretched was a little east from the
town of Albert.
The general attack was begun on a
twenty-mile front stretching north of the
Somme, but it was in this sector that the
weak spot in the German line was found
and pierced and the infantry hurled to
the attack.
German Losses Enormous.
British estimates of losses to the Ger
mans say they were enormous, while
the losses of the allies are well within
the limits to he expected of such a huge
movement.
Up to tonight fully 1,500 German pris
oners had been brought in. but their
arrival was continous and no complete
tally was possible. Most of them come
from the Prussian guards and the re
serve division, old foemen of the British
at Loos and Nuevechappelle.
The offensive launched today is the
first considerable effort of the British
army. In length of fropt engaged. weight
of metal and fighting strength. it is
casily the greatest offensive yet attempt
ed in the west.
It was begun five days ago with a
general bombardment. Three days ago
the cannonading gathered intensity, the
British guns averaging a million shells
a day. This morning at 6 o'clock this
furious bombardment reached its climax
in a terrible cannonading of one and
one-half hours duration. In ferocity and
the number of guns employed this final
outpouring of metal was without prece

ONLY TWO MEMIERS OPPOSE

Committees Urge Placing of
Nation on Strong War
Basis.
ADVOCATE BIG INCREASES
$100,000,000 More for Army
and $50,000,000 More for
Navy Recommended.
BIG NAVAL PROGRAM BACKED
Lessons of European War Heeded.
Appropriation for Field Artillery
Is Increased.
The Senate Military and Naval Affairs
Committees have taken the Initiative in
proposing to put the United State. in a
position of real preparedness for war.
Recommendations of more than a hun
dred million dollars' increase for the army
and nearly fifty millionn dollars' increase
forvthe navy. over and above what the
House recommended, were reported yes
terday from the Senate ead of the Capi
tol.
A formal report from the Senate Com
mittee on Naval Affairs was filed by Sen
stor Swanson. of Virginia. It calls for
a building program of ten battleships,
six battle cruisers, ten scout cruisers.
fifty torpedo boat destroyagm, nine fleet
submarines and forty-eight coast sub
marines, besides other auxiliary craft.
aggregating 167 new ships, all to be in
cluded in the three-year building pro
gram destined to put the United States
navy in a position to defend both coasta
against any enemy in 1919.
The committee goes even further than
the report of the General Board, of which
Admiral George Dewey is president, but
it is understood that the board heartily
Indorses the increase. In explaining its
report in this respect the committee says:
Time to He Redaced.
"It seemed to the committee that the
program for five years proposed by the
General Board was not sufficient to bring
the naval force of the United States teo1
the position which it C0ht to hold anienk1
the navies of the world at an early
enough period. The committee therefore
reduced the time covered by the program
from five years to three years, the com
mittee being convinced that the sooner
we could get an adequate navy the bet
ter, as the navy must always be our first
line of defense and we have two great
coasts to defend."
The total sum authorized in the bill as
reported to be appropriated in three years
is $804,018.870.56. It Is pointed out that the
Senate Committiee's report not only hap
strong Republican support back of it. but
that it is indorsed by President Wilson
and Secretary of the Navy Daniels. Sec
retary Daniels yesterday issued a state
ment in which he fully concurred in the
drastic measures of real preparedness ad
vocated by the committee.
Other Items Imereased.
The great increase in the building pro
gram is, of course, the feature of the
bill, but other Items of increase over the
House appropriations were the follow
ing:
Arming and equipping naval militia:
S883,000; ships for naval militia of Illinois
and Minnesota $40,000; Bureau of Ord
nance items, Including $1.50.000 for bat
teries for merchant auxiliaries and 9.000!
for a torpedo station at Newport; ex
perimental laboratory in connection with
the navy yards, SL000,000; improvements
in navy yards more than $2,000,000; 32.493,
260 for pay of the navy based on the In
crease of the navy enlisted personnel to
87,000 from 54.000 and an increase in the
enlisted strength of the Marine Corps to
17.400 men; $400.000 for two coast guard
vessels, one of which will be for service
in New York harbor.
Coincident with the increase recom
mended by the Senate Naval Committee,
increases aggregating more than a hun
dred million dollars over the House bill
have been tentatively agreed upon by the
Senate Committee on Military Affairs.
The work will be completed tomorrow,
and the bill will then be ready to be re
ported to the Senate.
In its plan to put the army on a real
basin-of preparedness the comlmittee has
taken the advice of military experts and'
has heeded the lessons which the Euro
pean war has pointedly taught. Thus the
House appropriation of $8,000,000 for field
artillery for the National Guard is in
creased to $14,20,000.

REVENUE ACT
BEFORE HOUSE
Defense Emergency Measure
Raises Income Tax Rate
One Per Cent.
rAXES ON INHERITANCES
AND MUNITIONS IMPOSED
The emergency revenue act intended
to raise 0.000,00o to defray the expenses
of the national defense program and a
part of the cost of the troop movements
incident to the trouble on the Mexican
border was introduced in the House yes
terday in behalf of the administration by
Representative Kitchin, the Democratic
leader.
The bill increases the normal rate of
the income tax law from 1 to 2 per cent.
It imposes a tax on Inheritances and a
tax on munitions of war. It retains all
of the features of the war emergency
act passed by the last Congress. with the
exeption of the stamp taxes. It pro
poses the enactment of an anti-dumping
clause aimed at the flooding of the
American market by foreign goods, and
provides for the creation of a nonparti
san tariff commission of five members.
It levies protective rates on dyestuffs
and chemicals.
Mr. Kitchin and his associates esti
mate that the proposed revenue law will
Yield 3250.000,000 a year. apportioned as
follows:
Increase of normal rate of income tal
and Increase of surtax rates of that law

eije emer;ency act of the last Congrea
to be re-enacted. 540.000,00. Grand total
5250,000.000.
Much to the surprise of the Reputlican
leaders, the normal or basic rate of the
income tax is increased from I to 2 pe
cent. This is applicable to all incomeP
above the exemption of 33.000 ard 54,00
up to 20W. In other words, the mar
ried man with an income of $5.000 a yea
who enjoys an exemption of $4000 wil
pay just twice as much as formerly. o
$20 a year instead of 5'.
The exemption of $3.000 a year for singl.
men and 4 for married is not changed
There Is also a substantial increase in
the surtax rates. effected through a re
duction in the figures at which the sur
tax rates begin to operate. The presen
law provides for surtax. or addltiona
rates beyond the tax of I per cent, as
follows:
