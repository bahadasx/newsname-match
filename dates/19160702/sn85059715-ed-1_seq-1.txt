Cause the Military Authorities
at Camps in Illinois to
Start Investigation.
' v AiiMuriD rnittf
SPRINGFIELD, 111., July 1.?Military
authorities at Camps Dunne and
Lincoln started an Investigation today
to learn whose fault it was that
the members of the First cavalry,
who did not entrain for the border
I until today, slept on cobblestones last
night while thirty-eight coaches wttn
berths made up were being switched
back and forth in the railway yards.
Inquiry of Col. E. Si. Lewis, chief
of mastering officers here, indicated
that the blame fell about evenly between
the-railroads and the military
organization. Exactly who among
the military officers were responsible
was not established.

WA8HINOTON, July 1.?With th#
adjournment ot tha House tonight,
. t-? tu Tutu It
over me r uunu m uui;, i?. uovumw
highly lmprobublo that tbe crlals between
fho United Statca and the defncto
government of Mexico would
come to Una! laaue before Wednesday I
at the earlleat.
Desplto growing Impatience nrer
General Carranxa's delay In comply- x'
Ing with demanda that he atate his
Intentlona toward American troops In
Mexico, Prealdcnt Wilson made no
move today toward laying the sltuatlon
before Congreaa. OIBclala believe
he will wait aome days at least
for n roply tn the note aont a week
ago tomorrow provldod there are no
further attache upon General PerahIng'a
men In the meantime.
llofore the de facto government
had compiled with the Orst demand
made In that note by releasing the -J
prisoners taken at Carrlxal, It was expeeled
the president would act within
a time limit axed in his owh mind,
If there was no reply or an unfavora- ;
ble one. The effect of tbe release order
apparently haa been to lengthen
this limit.
No Development!.
There were no official despatch*!
today, dealing with the probable ten- .
or of the note It Is known the de
facto government officials are fram- ;
Ing. Private messages had nothing
to add to tho gloomy outlook they
reflected yesterday. In fact there
were no developments of any sort
during the day in the diplomatic alt- I
uatlon. although the war department ;?
and Congress still ground away on *
measures of preparation whatever the n
future may hold.
Undor the war department censor- ,3
ship, no information General Funston ,
or the general stall may have as to
movements of Mexican troops beyond
the border was available. Humors j

around the strip of territory occupied
by Oeneral PerBhlng's men, leaving
open only a well guarded road back |
to the border. War department of- . '!
flclals refused to discuss these re- i
ports.
Decision Not Changed.
The rumored movements of Mex*
lean troops appear to be in line with '
the decision Oeneral Carranza is said
by private advices to have adopted. II
was predicted that he would reaffirm
his Intention to allow no operation* it
of the American forces on Mexican ..."
soil except toward the border.
It was the order to this effect to
Oeneral Trevlno. commanding In Chi- ' i
huahua slate, which gave the present 'i
crisis its most ominous aspect. Secretary
Lansing has defined as a hoe- X-i
tile act and has asked the de facto
government if it desired that it:
: should be so construed. On the answer
to that Inquiry hangs whatever
action President Wilson has plannedi '.gj
