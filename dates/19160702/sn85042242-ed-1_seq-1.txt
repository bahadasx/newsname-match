voted the remainder of the day just
to walking about. Mr. Hughes had
few callers today. To those saw him,
the nominee made plain his intention
of spending, all the time he could be­
fore the campaign in relaxation and
recreation. Preliminary work will be
concentrated so far as it can be into
two or three days a week, which he

AMBASSADOR-DESIGNATE
ISSUED A PROTEST
Washington,
"inly I.—A report from
General Bell regarding the killing of
a Mexican on the Mexican side of the
border, at Ysl^La, yesterday, by Ser­
geant J. K. Fair of the Eighth caval­
ry, was received tonight at the war
department. General Bell said the
sergeant, was'.•justified because of the
suspicious conduct of the Mexican
killed, and a companion. .The killing
was the subject of a vigorous protest
to the state department, by the Mexi­
can ambassador designate. General
Bell's report reads:
"Sergeant J. K. Fair, "Troop C,
Eighth cavalry, on oiitpost duty, at
about 6:45 ip. m. yesterday, at Ysleta,
saw two Mexicans on the opposite
side of the river one of whom appear­
ed to act in a very suspicious man­
ner, dropping Jiis hands toward his
weapon and jerking up his horse
short, and Fair, believing himself in
danger, drew and fired first. Both
Mexicans- fode off, but one died of
wounds.
Commends Sergeant.
"Troop commwider states he can
only commend Hie sergeant for his
prompt actioti. in my opinion,-it is
a very unfortunate affair, but one that
parties on this side, and the Ameri
can soldier has reason to put no faith
in an armed man who acts suspicious­
ly on the opposite bank, although the
orders are most drastic and com­
mand. him not to fire unless fired up
on."
In a protest to the state department
Mr. Arredondo charged that an Amer
lean trooper filed on the two Mexi­
cans, who were customs officials.
General Funston made this com
ment cn the incident:
Sarrfeant Justified.
"It is believed that Sargeant Fair
was justified in believing himself in
danger and in firing on the Mexicans
who were threatening to shoot him
In view of the fact, of the killing of
Sargeant Hairy Furman, of the 23rd
infantry, it is easy to understand con­
ditions existing along, the border and
the possibilities of our men being
killed, when the armed Mexicans
threaten to shoot at them as was
done in this case."
General Funston also forwarded a
report from General Pershing, adding
the name of Dalley Farer to the list
of the Tenth cavalry troopers wound­
ed in the Carrizal fight.
Sll (IlltO BY
Emporium, Pa., July 1.—Six men
were killed instantly, one injured,
probably fatally, and five others ser­
iously burned here this afternoon,
when several thousand pounds of
powder exploded in the dryhouse at
the Aetna Explosive company's plant.
The building was demolished.
Four of the dead have not been
identified. One of the injured is re­
ported to be in a serious condition.

E WILL BL
TAKEN UP AFTER
No Developments Expected in
Mexican Situation for
for Few Days
PREPAREDNESS MEASURES
STILL BEING CARRIED OUT
No Information as to Movements
of Troops Is Avail­
able
Washington, July 1.—With the ad­
journment of the house tonight over
the Fourth of July, it became highly
improbable that the crisis between
the United States and the de facto
government of-Mexico would come to
final issue before Wednesday at ihe
earliest. Desipite growing impatient
over General Carranza's delay in com­
plying with demands that he state
his intention toward .ApitiMcan troops
in Mexico, President Wilspp(imade no
move today toward lay«ng -the situa­
tion before congress. Officials be­
lieve he will wait some days at least
for a reply to the note sent a week
ago tomorrow, provided there are no
further attacks on General Pershing's
mejwin ,the ..raaaotiiae- EMota. tha
de facto government had complied
with the first demand made in that
note by releasing the prisoners taken
at Carrizal, it was expected the presl*
dent would act within a time limit
fixed in his mind if there was no re­
ply or an unfavorable one. The ef­
fect of the release order apparently
had been to lengthen the limit.
No Further Developments.
There were no official dispatches
today dealing with the probable tenor
of the note it is known the de facto
government officials are framing.
Private messages had nothing.to adfli
to the gloomy outlook they reflected
yesterday. In fact, there were no
developments of any sort during the
day in the diplomatic situation, al­
though the war department and con­
gress still ground away on measures
of preparedness against whatever the
future may hold.
Under the war department censor­
ship, no information General Funs
ton or the general staff may have as
to movements of Mexican troops be­
yond the border was available. Ru­
mors said Carranza soldiers were
massing around the strip of territory
occupied by General Pershing's men,
leaving open only the well guarded
road back to the border. War de­
partment officials refused to discuss
these reports.' It is known, however,
that they are fully confident of Gen­
eral Pershing's ability to protect him­
self under any circumstances.
Will Increase Appropriation.
A few bulletins written in abrupt
military style were given out during
the day by Major MacArthur. In con­
gress, the senate military cdmmittee
prepared to increase by probably
more than $10,000,000 the army ap­
propriation bill as it passed the
house. The committee now has ap­
proved increases totaling $75,000,000.
It is expected the $182,000,000 meas­
ure passed by the house will reach a

GERMANS COUNTER WITH I
FIERCE ARTILLERY THRUSTS
London, July 1.—British and French troops, thrown forward
tn a grand offensive against the German lines on both sides of .the
river Sommc, 60 miles north of Paris, have penetrated at one
point to a depth of five miles, taken villages and captured a laby­
rinth of trenches extending to a depth of ,000 yards on a front of
seven miles.
MOST SPECTACULAR.
The drive, the most spectacular in this region since the Brit*'
Ish captured Loss last September, began Saturday morning after
the German trenches had been bathed in a hail of shells from'
guns of every calibre for days. Progress has been reported along
the entire front of about 25 miles.
GERMANS COME BACK.
The greatest success gained by the British was on. th# right.^
In the center they captured what are designated in the official re­
port as "many strong points" along a front of four miles- But
north of Andre valley, to Gommecourt, powerful counter .attacks'
by the Germans have resulted in forcing the British back from
various sections of the ground gained in their first onslaught.

Serre, the ViHatfesv"3r tteFutetii'e?
Boiselle and Mamets have been cap*
tured. Two thousand German^ prisob*
ers have passed through the British
collecting station. .:
In co-operating with the British thi
French initiated strong offensive.
South of the Somme they captureift
four villages and north of that villact
they established thmselves in Hardif
court and Curlu. The number of uA«
wounded German prisoners taken by
the French have reached 3,500, up to
the time of the sending of the iastj
official report.
Recapture Thiaumont.
The recapture of the famous ThiaU*
mont woods by the French also has
been effected. This important strate*
gic point has changed hands several
times and around it probably thous­
ands of men have fallen. On the left
bank of the Meu.se the fighting is
most intense around iHill No. 304, Le*
mort Homme and Avoucourt.
In the Trentino the Italians con*
tinue to advance along the entire line
and in the Arsa valley. Artillery bom­
bardments marked the actions the
west of the Austro-Italian fronts.
While the Russians report progress
south of the Dniester river, in Gslicia,
the Austro-Germans claim the capture
of Russian works west and northwest
of Lutsk, especially in the vicinity ot
Sokul, Volhynia.
Capture Villages.
Maintaining their drive against th4
Austrians in Galicia, in the region ot
Kolomea, the Russians have captured
many villages. Northeast of Kimpo*
lung, Bukowina, the Russians already
are in the mountains and they report
the seizure of several strong posi­
tions. Attacks of German troops in
the region of Leipa river were repuls­
ed with heavy losses, Petrograd as*
serts.
The German troops under General
von Linsingen have taken Russian po»
sitions west of Kolki, and southwest
of Sokul. Fighting Is in progress
southwest of Lutsk. General von Lin*
singen forces, since June 16, have cap*
tured 26 officers and 2,165 men* Pet*
rograd reports the number of prison*
ers taken from June 4 to June 30, in«

to the pressure on the entire front
