Along1 with Company C. the rcFt of

Team work is the greatc-sa asset 01

Will Make Fight on Evi
dence of Spots Left by

CHICAGO, July 1. The apparently
powerful evidence of the three
white spots alleged to have been left
on the overcoat of Marlon Lambert by
cyanide of potassium In solution was
the subject of attack at the trial of
William H. Orpet, college student

It was said by a member of tho de
ense forces that a number of sur
prises on this point are in store for
the state and that the most startling
of these will coino (rem the witness
stand when court, which adjourned
over the Fourth of July, Is called In
session next Wednesday. Marion I.am
liert, a high school girl who had been
Orpot's sweetheart, died of cyanide
of potassium poisoning In Helms wood
February 9. Her body was recovered
the next morning and an inquest held
that night.
Two members of the coroner's Jury,
Alexander Allen and Gtorge L.
lilanchard, testified with regard to
the coat today. They Impeached to
nn extent the testimony of Fred I.

for Marlon's body. Wenban testified
that at abniit 4 p. m. on I'cbinary 10
the three white spots were observed
bv him, although he had not noticed
them In the forenoon. Chemists tes
tified that the spots were left by a
solution of potassium cyanide ana
that In this form tho spots would not
appear until after evtpnrattop of the
liquid.
Allen and Tllnnohard testified that
nt 8 o'clock that night as mors they
examined the coat and there were no
pots on it. The coat was rot sent
to a chemist for examination unth
several wecku after the Inquest,
The testimony of the tvo Jurors was
prefatory. It was said, to an attempt
of the defenre to prove that the spots
did not got on the coat through the
instrumentality either of Marlon or
Orpet.

to become the rage this season
Humane Ax'ent A. M. Welch will In
augurate a campaign Monday to make
things as comfortable for thn equine
class this summer ns possible, and
drivers and teamsters will bo asked
to see that the animals who hove to
work hard In the heat of the day are
equip! ed with straw hots, which will
shield them trom the terrific rays
from the sun.
Another suggestion will be for
drivers who find It necessary to make
lonir drives to carry a pall with which
to water the animal at different In
tervals. Every effort Is being- made by the
Iti.mi.ne socltty to protect horses snd
other animals. During Juno nearly
a hundred and fifty warnings were
Issued to drivers who were driving
with excessive loads. Several animals
were ordered shot, and every prooeu
tion Is being taken to keep vnflt
horses off the market.
According to Welch, drivers are be
ccming mors and more onreful in
their manner of treating tlwlr horses.
In mot Instances the warnings have
been well received, and It has not
been necessary to rebuke a driver
more than once.
The report signifies that more care
and attention is being shown horses
and stock this summer than ever be
fore. Safety In Numbers.
"I have here," said tho agent, "a
utensil that no housekeeper can af
ford to be without"
"What Is It?" asked the woman at
the door.
"It's a combined corkscrew, ran

XTtTASIII.MiTiiN, July 1 -With the

night over tho Fourth of July it be
came highly Improbable that the
crisis between tho I'nited Slates ani
the do facto government of Mexico
would come to final issue betore Wed
nesday at the earliest.
Oespito growing Impatience over
General Carra.nz.fs delay in comply
ing with demands that he Mate his
Intentions toward American troops In

move today toward laying the situ
ation before congress. i 'fliclals be

for a reply to the note sent a week

further attacks upon Geiiertl Pe'sh

complied with the first demand mtilu
In that note by releasing the prison
ers taken at Carrizal, It was txpecten
the president would act within a tlihe
limit fixed in his own 1111111', If then
was no reply or an unfavtu able one.
Tho effect of the reltuse order appar
ently has been to lengthen this limit,
though how much only the, presideiu
himself knows.
No l)isiiu-lics Given.
There were no official t'lspatches
today dealing with the probable tt nov
of the note It Is known ti n do facto
huvi.i iMiicnt officials are framing.
Private messages had nothing to add
to the gloomy outloe they reflecleu
yisterday. In fact, there were no
developments of any sort during tho
day in the diplomatic situation,
though the war department and con
gress still ground away on measures
of preparation against win lever the
future may hold.
t'nder the war dcpirtinen' censor

or tho general staff may have as to
movements of Mexican troops beyond
