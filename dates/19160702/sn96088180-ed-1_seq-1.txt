' London, July 1. The long expect
ed British offensive began at 7:30
this morning with a tremendous
smash against the German lines on
a twenty-mile' front north of the
Somme. Tht Information waa con
tained in br'lef special bulletin from
army headquarters today. Tbe Brit
ish iwept forward with a rnsh, cap
turing tome enemy frontline trenches.
Many German prisoner were taken.
The British attack were continuing
with the greatest violence at the
hour when the dispatches were filed.
The first reports were flashed to
London shortly before noon. News
paper extras were grabbed eagerly
In the clubs, hotels, on the streets
everywhere. Within a few minutes
the word spread throughout London
"the big push ha begun."
The public, aroused by announce
ment early today, that the Russians
have captured the Important Galiclan
city of . Kolomea, that the French
have had successes In the fighting
northeast of Verdun and that the
Italians are ateadily pushing north
ward In the Trentlno, accepted tbe
early bulletins as clear . indication
that tbe long-awaited super-offensive
ot the allies has began.
The It Ish thrust forward today
followed four days of the most lavish
expenditure of shell tire the world
has ever known. The German front
tor nearly ninety miles, from Tser
to the Somme, was bathed in a never-
ceasing flame ot artillery pounding
with the explosion ot millions of
shells.
At dawn today the British bom
bardment, which grew more Intense
throughout the nlgbt, suddenly con
centrated a terrific fire on the Ger
man line from the Arras, south to
the Somme. For an hour and a halt
the brief bulletins received In Lon
don, said the German line was under
a steady rain of high explosive shells
that blotted put trenches and human
life. " ' '
The big guns lifted their fire at
7:30. At the same Instant rows of
British troops sprsng forward
the attack. They were seasoned regi
ments who had been awaiting eager
ly their chance at the Germans for
many months and new regiments
from "Kitchener's armies," which had
been held In reserve back of the
lines.
"By 9:30 a. m.," read the des
patch, "we had occupied the German
front line, digging In behind rows ot
German dead. British casualties
thus far have not been heavy."
With full knowledge that London
bad been watting for days tensely
eager for the beginning ot what many
believe the world's greatest offensive,
the censors hastened the despatch of
' messages direct from the front to
the British capital
For this reason
;men alttlng quietly In their clubs
were reading at 1Z:30 p. m. orier
Hashes, telling what hna nappenea
'across the channel In France, as far
'south a the river Somme, at 9:30
this morning. . Only three hours had
elapsed between the crash of British
and German under the screaming of
great shells and the time the news
had reached London.
"All the hortxon beyond the ground
where I stood today was darkened by
the fumes of shells," wired the July 1. British troops have cap

MEXICAN POLICY
IGII
E
Washington, July 1. President
Wilson has taken his 'Mexican policy
for a campaign issue and put it up
to his political adversaries.
This is the opinion of political and
official Washington today, following
the president' return from New York
where he spoke last night.
Taking the Issue which his repub
lican opponents had threatened to
make the principal object of attack.
the president has adopted It as bis
own.
The questions he raised last night
in his speech before the New York
Press club were believed directed pri
marily at those contesting his re
election. Tbe questions were:
Would the glory of America be
enhanced by war of conquest In Mex
ico? ......
wouia an act or violence by a
powerful nation like this against
weak and distracted neighbor reflect
distinction upon the annals of the
United States?
. Is it our duty to carry self-defense
to tbe point of dictation In the af
fairs of another people?
From .this and other ' utterances
along the same line, the president is
said by hla trlenda today to have
indicated clearly he will not count
enance war between the United States
and Mexico save as aa unavoidable
resort, in settling border troubles.
For the second time In as many
days he said he would stake bla
personal fortunes upon the ideal he
Is following In Mexico.
For the first time the president In
dicated what may be In his mind as
to the Immediate purpose of concen
trating such large armed fprces on
the border. "
"Force." he said, "can sometimes
hold things steady until opinion Las
bad time to form. No force ever ex
erted, except in response to that op
inion. Was ever a conquering and
predominating force."
And thus the president last night.
throwing off his customary restraint,
expounded hla creed. It Is one of
peace, supported, he said, by a vast
matorltr of tbe letters And niessaeve
sent to him from men and women
In all parts of the country, urging
and praying that he avoid hostilities
in Mexico. The president Intimated
he would go to the extreme lengths
ot diplomatic recourse before he will
resort to the use of arms in forcing
Mexico to cooperate with this country
in protecting Its own people.
