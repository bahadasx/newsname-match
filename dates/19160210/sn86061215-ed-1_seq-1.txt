While Teuton Troops
Are Moved Away
New York, Feb. 9.—The German
warship Roon, alleged to be the
captor of, the Appam, has been
captured by the British battleship
Drake after a three hour flght 200
miles east-northeast of Bermuda,
•aeordlng to the New York Even
ing Globe today.
The capture of the Roon Is said
by the Globe to have been follow
ed by the seizure of two merchant
men flying the German flag, one of
which was armed.
London, Feb. 9.—The predicted Ger
man offensive on the Franco-Belgian
front has not developed, but reports
of preparation* for it persist. Am
sterdam reports today that 600,000
xhen have been sent by the Germans
to the Belgian frontier.
From the Balkans It is declared in
one unofficial quarter that the entente
allies are preparing to take the offen
sive in Salonlki. Athens reports that
the central powers plan to maintain
their entrenched positions at present,
leaving mainly Bulgarians on guard,
the Austrian troops for the most part
being employed elsewhere.
Constantinople advices report set
backs for the Russians in their Cau
casus campaign and in Persia. Rus
sian attacks have been repulsed in
the former field of operations, where
Erzerum has been the main Turkish
base of defense, the Ottoman war of
fice declares. In Persia, tribesmen
fighting against the Russian forces!
are unofficially reported to have in
flicted a severe defeat near Sandshu
lak.
Russians Make Gain.
Heavy fighting Is in progress in
East GaHcia and the Russians, after
repeated attacks on an Austro-Hun
garlan position near Tarnopol, enter
ed the point attacked. According to
Vienna, however, they were after
wards ejected.
The London Times* military expert
estimates that during the eighteen
months of the war Germany has lost
about 2,700,000 men. He believes that
Germany now has 3,600,000 men in
the field, ana. that she had about
9,000,000 men available at the begin
ning of the war. This, he says, would
leave her a reserve of S,700,000 men,
many of whom are needed for inter
nal duty. The expert thus concludes
that Germany still has a reserve of
2,000,000 and
says
that until these are
exhausted the strength of her armies
in the field will not begin to fall her.
New German Anthem.
A Geneva, Switzerland, paper says
Emperor William has composed the
words for a new national hymn and
has asked Richard Strauss to com
pose the music. The emperor, the
newspaper says, aims to replace the
Prussian hymn "Heil dir im Sieger
kranz," which Is sung to the same
tune as the British national anthem.
SEEK SEPARATE PEACE.
Rome, Feb. 9.—The Giornade
D'ltalia states that Monsignor Tacci
Porcelli, the papal nuncio to Belgium,
presented to Belgium Germany's pro
posals for a separate peace. Whether
or not he was authorized to do so by
the Vatican, says the newspaper, has
not been ascertained.
It Is said that Germany, through
Prince von Buelow and other promi
nent personages, has Indicated that the
terms she is ready to offer to Belgium
for the concluding of separate peace
comprise the restoration of Belgium
to the government of King Albert and
the payment of a large Indemnity for
damages caused by the invasion and
the occupation and that she asks in
return economical and commercial
privileges which would practically
transform the port of Antwerp into a
German center of traffic. To these pro
posals Belgium is said to have replied
with a prompt refusal and a declara
tion of Intention to adhere to the allies
and not to conclude a separate peace.
Statements regarding efforts being
made to induce Cardinal Mercier to use
his Influence in favor of proposals for
a separate peace have also been made
but It is asserted that they have been
In vain. Cardinal Mercier is living in
strict retirement in Rome, where he re
ceives no visitors and where he is re
cuperating from an attack of grip. The
cardinal is occupied in working out
plans for the reconstitution of the ec
clesiastical seminaries of Belgium, in
accordance with the provisions of the
new Roman congregation which has
been appointed by Pope Benedict to
take charge of seminaries throughout
th* world.

IN FORM OF NOTE
INSERTION WILL SHOW THAT
AGREEMENT IS OUTCOME OF
U. 8. PROTESTS.
Washington, D. C., Feb. 9.—Ger
many's latest proposal in the Lusi
tania case having proved, in sub
stance, satisfactory to the United
States, final settlement of the contro
versy Is expected within a few days.
Some alterations, however, in the
form of the agreement, regarded as
minor ones, are to be made to meet
the wishes of the American govern
ment and involve the dispatch of the
proposal again to the Berlin foreign
office. One of the changes, it is stated
authoritatively, is that the communi
cation shall specifically include the
statement that it was in answer to the
last American note.
The changes were suggested to
Count von Bernstorff, the German am
bassador, by Secretary Lansing, after
President Wilson and his cabinet had
gone over the latest proposal of Ger
many. The ambassador submitted the
whole question by cable to the Berlin
government for final approval. It is
said that a reply will be forthcoming
in about six days.
In Teutonic diplomatic circles today
the belief was experssed that the pro
posed changes would be accepted by
the Berlin foreign office.

SUB-COMMITTEE TO
PASS ON EVIDENCE
Iowan Is First Witness to
Attack the Motives of
Wilson's Nominee
Washington, D. C., Feb. 9.—Inquiry
into the nomination of Louis D. Bran
dels of Boston to fill the vacancy on
the supreme bench caused by the
death of Justice Lamar, was begun
today before a subcommittee of the
senate judiciary committee.
A number of witnesses, all protest
ants against Mr. Brandeis' nomina
tion, were on hand ready to testify.
The committee later will consider nu
merous petitions from individuals and
organizations urging confirmation.
Because of the widespread interest
in the nomination, the committee de
cided to hold public sessions. So far
as known it is the first instance in
which such a nomination has been in
quired into except behind closed
doors.
Witnesses summoned to testify in
cluded Clifford Thorne of the Iowa
railroad commission S. W. Wlnslow,
president of the United Shoe Machin
ery Co. P. J. Lennox, James J. Stor
row and C. W. Barron, Boston Thom
as C. Spelling, New York Joseph M.
Teal, Portland, Ore., and Lieut. Gov.
John M. Eshleman, California.
Mr. Thorne, the first witness, told
of his connection with shippers and
state railroad commissioners' organi
zations opposing increases In freight
rates to the eastern roads before the
interstate commerce commission In
1910 and 1913. He said that he was
first asked to participate in thi 1918
case, by Mr., Brandeis. Mr. Thorne
declined but later Agreed when Henry
Martin of Kansas withdrew from the
case to become vice governor of the
Philippines.
The interstate commerce commis
sion, he said, indicated the funda
mental question to be determined was:
"Are the railroads entitled to more
revenue, and, If so, where shall the
revenue be secured?"
Then Mr. Thorne stated that his ap
pearance before the committee was
not at his own instance but at the re
quest of Chairman Chilton.
"At the outset two facts stand out,
it appears to me," Mr. Thorne declar
ed. "In the first place I believe the
nominee before this committee was
guilty of infidelity, of breach of faith
and of unprofessional conduct in con
nection with one of the greatest cases
of this generation.
"In the second place, in open court
hearing, while acting as special coun
sel, Mr. Brandeis committed himself
to the proposition that the net return
of 7% per cent above all expenses, all
interest on debts, on capital stock of
railroads was inadequate, or to use
his own words, 'negligent.' This had
been held inadequate by the commis
sion in 1910."
First Blood for Brandeis.
At the beginning of the hearing the
subcommittee voted down a proposal
to have the full committee hear the
case. That was regarded by some as
a first victory for Mr. Brandeis on the
ground that the subcommittee was
favorable and the full committee hos
tile. The full committee, however,
will act on the subcommittee's re
port and senators who are not on one
side or the other professed to see no
particular significance in the matter.

EXECUTIVE BOARD SAYS THE
DEMANDS ARE FOR MORE
PAY, NOT SHORTER DAY.
Chicago, Feb. 9—The executive com
mittee of the Association of Western
Railways has issued the following
statement:
The wage demands now being voted
on by the railroad enginemen and
trainmen do not mean a real eight
hour working day. They provide sole
ly for an Increase in wages that would
amount to $100,000,000 a year.
The proposed rules would simply
change from a ten-hour to an eight
hour basis of computing wages, so
that one hour's work shall be paid for
as one-eighth rather than as one-tenth
of a day's pay, or as 12% miles instead
of 10 miles.
While the officers of the brother
hoods have attempted to make the
publi^ believe they ate seeking a real
eight-hour day, they have taken some
pains to reassure the employes that no
reduction in working hours Is contem
plated. Nothing could be more con
vincing on this point than the follow
ing statement by Val Fitzpatrick, vice
president of the Brotherhood of Rail
road Trainmen, published in the Jan
uary issue of the Railroad Trainman:
"There Is quite a difference," he
says, "between an eight-hour work
day and an eight-hour basic work day.
The eight-hour basic work day (which
is the system proposed by the train
service brotherhoods) contemplates
that eight hours shall be the basis for
a day's work, and any time in excess
shall be paid for as overtime. Under
Buch
a system there is no limit to the
hours that may be worked."
What the men are asking for is a
reduction of 26 per cent in the number
of hours they must work before they
will begin to draw pay for overtime,
this overtime to be at a rate 50 per
cent higher than the proposed regular
hourly rate and 87% per cent higher
than the present overtime rate.
This is made plain by article 1 (c)
of the demands, which reads "on runs
of over 100 miles overtime will begin
when the time on duty exceeds the
miles run divided by 12% miles an
hour." Under this rule so long as a
train runs at a Bpeed of 12% miles or
more per hour, so that the crew is
earning pay at the rate of one-eighth
of the day rate per hour or more,
they do not even ask overtime, but if
it runs at a slower rate of speed they
ask overtime. Such a rule clearly
is not intended to penalize overtime
but to accelerate the earning capacity
of the crews.
The controversy is not over a ques
tion of hours it Involves solely a $100,
000,000 increase in wages which the
public would have to nay.

TO SIM FIIR
Burlington Man Arrives to
Begin Work of Promoting
the Agricultural Show
MUST HAVE $20,000
WITHIN SHORT TIME
Subscriptions Are Being
Secured Want Date on
Big Racing Circuit
Preliminary plana are completed for
the organization of the Iowa ft Mis
souri fair and the next step is the
securing of the money. And it may
be added that this is the most import
ant of all as it is the only thing that
will make the big idea a reality.
Much discussion has been had on
the subject and it is believed that all
of the business men have made up
their minds on the Bubject and are
prepared to sign up quickly and thus
facilitate the work of the men in
charge of the movement.
G. EX Holcombe of Burlington, is now
on the job and states that It is im
perative that enough encouragement
is shown this week to warrant going
ahead with the project as this is the
time when plans for the fair circuit
are made and delay will handicap the
management.
Will Aek Circuit Date.
On Feb. 15, the Great Western Cir
cuit will meet in Chicago and allot the
dates for the season and vote new
memberships in the circuit. As their
rules require at least $20,000 be pledg
ed In propositions of this kind to se
cure recognition it can easily be seen
why it is necessary to avoid delay.
Why the Great Western circuit? Be
cause it is next to the Grand circuit
in importance and class of racing, and
comprises among its members all of
the large state fairs Including Des
Molneft and Minneapolis. They are
succesaful because they positively
eliminate gambling of all kinds and
the horses race for the many prizes.
To be a member of the Great Western
is a guarantee to horsemen and ex
hibitors of all kinds and to the public
at large that the fair is one of class.
The $20,000 necessary Is not for
purses but simply required on new
propositions to show that enough
money has been subscribed to avoid
any possibility of failure to fill the
dates alloted.
MUch enthusiasm has been shown
but as Mr. Holcombe says we can al
ways get closer to the real sentiment
when talking dollars and cents.
It is felt by the promoters that
-V 1 'V
W*-y*tS
a
fair for Ottumwa would be a grand
thing and would help the city's re
sources as nothing else can and that
the people will rise to the situation
and malfe it possible to get the project
underway.
Capitalize For $75,000.
The subscription blank that is being
used by Mr. Holcombe and the com
mittee aiding him in the promoting of
the fair, explains fully the project and
what is expected to make possible the
organization of such an undertaking in
Ottumwa. The subscription blank fol
lows:
We, the undersigned, do severally
subscribe for and agree to take the
number of shares of capital stock set
opposite our names in an association to
be Incorporated for the purpose of ac
quiring grounds, constructing and
holding an annual agricultural exhibi
tion to be known as the Iowa and Mis
souri Agricultural fair.
It is understood that the association
will be incorporated under the laws of
the state of Iowa, capitalized at $75,
OoO, divided into 1,500 shares, with a
par' value of fifty dollars per share,
fully paid and non-assessable and that
the subscription shall become due and
payable in such amounts and at such
times as the regularly elected board of
directors shall determine. A stock
holders' meeting for the purpose of
electing officers and directors may be
called as soon as $20,000 is subscribed.
It is understood that this subscrip
tion shall not be binding upon the
subscribers, hereto until the sum of
$20,000 in stock has been subscribed.

TRALITY VIOLATIONS.
San Francisco, Feb. 9.—Fifty-nine
federal Indictments—thirty-two charg
ing violations of American neutrality,
directed against German consular of
ficials here, the Turkish consul gen
eral and steamship agents, and
twenty-seven against immigration of
ficials in connection with the at
tempted smuggling of elghtyHSix Chi

day of the United States district at
torney's office. It was said they
would be returned in open court to
morrow when arrests would follow.
The Indictments against the Ger
man consular officials, who include
Franz Bopp, the consul general, were
voted yesterday by the federal grand
Jury as a result of the nation wide in
vestigation by the department of Jus
tice into bomb plots and neutrality
violations which involved interference
with shipments of war munitions to
the allied governments and the fur
nishing of coal and supplies to Ger
man warships In the Paciflo.
The indictments are the first the
government has attempted to obtain
against official representatives of any
foreign power in connection with its
efforts to curtail the activities of per
sons engaged In the alleged plots.
The indictments voted against Im
migration officials and steamship men
followed a searching inquiry into re
ports that a wholesale traffic in con
traband aliens was being carried on
with the help of steamship officers
and the connivance of federal officials.
Surprise at Number.
While the indictments against the
consular officials were not unexpected
here, some surprise "was manifested
today over the large number of true
bills, which indicated, it was said, that
the government had completed the
San Francisco investigation of the
conspiracy plots The following
were among those against whom in
dictments were voted:
Frank Bopp, consul general of Ger

BOSTON BASE FOR PLOTTERS.
Boston, Feb. 9.—Federal authorities
were engaged today with reports that
Boston was being used by German
sympathizers as a base for the direc
tion of hostile activities in Canada.
It was admitted by a government em
ploye that typewritten copies were
made of dictagraph records alleged
to have been obtained at a meeting
place of men under suspicion. This
admission was coupled with*the assur
ance that It would be denied if the
identity of the author was made public.
According to the reports which led
to the admission regarding the dicta
graph records, the movements of
about 100 men have been watched,
with the result that a dictagraph was
installed in a Milk street office to de
termine if any of these men were con
spiring to commit or influence the
commission of acts of war against
Canada.
George W. Anderson, United States
attorney, went to Washington on Mon

Statement of the Board.
In order that the cdmtmmlty ma|
have a more intelligent uivderstaTHj
ing of the need of additional roottf'
our high school, the board wishes .tl
make the following statement: 1"
When our present high school
built some seventeen years ago, prp»|
vision was made to care for
pupils as the maximum capacity o|
the building. At that time proviHoil
for this number was
undou|trdl
deemed adequate and it. has been 6t
for many years. Today, however, W|
have an enrollment of r»rnf||
more than twice the normn' '"""ifiti
of the building. Every tna'-f'^f''
sible has been employpd, b"t t1,r'
11c can readily see the JTinopR'HIitl
of giving anyt'ifns like "Pjl
treatment to teachers or pupils und4I
such conditions.
The growth of tho hi eh school
been much more rapid thEi te prowil
of the population of the city. Withi^
five years the number of mipils W
rolled tyts doubled, while the growt
of the city has been slleht., This lifl
been due to two principal cause
First, the course of instruction
been materially extended and mad
more useful and attractive. Second
there is without doubt an increftsipp
desire on the part of parents to hav|
their children get the full benefit
the public schools, and on the part
the children to complete a high achooj
course.
We believe the people of Ottunri
will appreciate this situation and yr||
recognize the great advantage
come to our community through tt
service of a modern and well eouipj
high school. The pupils of today
be the citizens of tomorrow and tl
