Unprecedented storms have
visited this section of the coun
try since the beginning of the
year. Sunday, January 30th is
the first pleasant day Sedona
has seen in over four weeks. Re
ports from Munds Park say that
on the 27th three feet one inch of
new snow fell. That was fol
lowed by an all night rain that
reduced the snow about fourteen
inches. The snow, then became
crystallized and ice like ..laying
orgr. trie hillsf and valleys in a
heavy 'layer - beneath- -which tb e
water murmuredand gurgled.
Word came from Camp Verde
that the Verde River was one
foot higher than ever before
known. It flowed within a foot
of the driveway of the' Camp
Verde bridge. It is said that
much damage has been done to
land and ditches by the Verde
and tributaries.
Ihe first steam whistle heard
anywhere the length of Oak
Creek was inaugurated at the
"Sedona' bridge site about the
fifteenth " day of January 1916.
It belongs to the steam engine
used ' on the Centrifugal r pump
which keeps the water out of the
excavation for West abuttment.
The hole is over 20 feet from the
surface to the bottom and it is
expected to go three feet deeper
then raise the forms and pour
cement.

"It was early in October, ;
Ere the" leaves began to fall;

In his eye gleamed deadly war.
And addressing thus the council, j
As the air with fist he Btnote: ,,. . J
"Ere we get. our cherished Tax Bill
We must get the Governor's goat".
"Though we had a legislature
Proud, to heed our least command,

With a veto in his hand." -" -

Like all other schemes we've tried,"
E'en tho doubt and fear assail us
The recall must be applied".
"What .say you to this my plan,
Sir? . .. "
What say you, my bold Cohort?"
Thu3 addressed, there came the
answer
From the man behind the Wart:
Since no other plan is left us
To obtain the Mine Tax Bill, .
Of which Governor Hunt bereft
us,
I approve with hearty will." , .,.
"He has threatened us with bull-
" Pen, . .
Saying we must heed the law. -

'Stirs my soul with deep emotion
Thottgfits' of Clifton make'me sad.
They do things better, to my
notion, , ..
At Walsenbnrg and Trinidad".
Thus he spoke and then subsided
With a deep sepulchral groan, .; ., ,
As into his seat he glided,
Rang these orders from the throne:
"Hear and heed me, serfs and
vassals,
See you bring me Hunt's recall.
If you fail me By my: Castles!
Heads, like wheat, shall quickly
fall". . '
"Creighton, keep the presses
going, " . ''
Fool the people all you can.
Anything to make a showing,
That will help our latest plan".
"Stapley, I will name you chair

This, I hold, is only fair, man
Some one's got to be the 'goat' ".
"Charley, you shall have employ,
And shall have good monthly pay;
You I name as errand boy,
'Till I throw the plant away".

THE NEWMLLIAMS
(By Mrs. A. Sine)
It was in June 1920,'and a num
ber of tourists were standing on the
heights South of the city of Will
iams viewing the scene before them.
To the North, the upper - rim of
the Grand Canyon of Colorado,
about eighty miles distant, was a
blue streak on the horizon: , nearer
were the mountains covered with
stately pine ,. frees. : Still, inearer
were fields of grain,- their , different
shades of green: adding varietyreto
the view.1" There were-vepetafiU-irar..
- o - o
ens, laid out with Chinese: 'perci
sion. s At the foot of the. heights
was the railroad, and ? clustered -.
around it were the buildings which
comprised the City of Williams.
been built farther up on the hill
side, until now they crowned its
crest. Pretentious homes were.,
there, their flowered terraces add
J .- .
ing beauty to the view and fra
grance to the air. Some small ;
houses were also to be seen, cling
ing tenaciously to the hillside, lest
some wind, stronger than its .pre
decessor, would blow them into' the
streets below. The well-built, . oil- -
,ed roads, ha j a surface dressing of
.cinders, which were to be obtained
Hn any part of thin section of the
Stale. If a ; dignified ;;pine tree
disputed the 'right-of-way, it was
not disturbed the road being cur
ved around it. The roads were
bordered with grass-grown boule
vards, which covered the once open
gutters. Sidewalks were of cement;
the majority of fences were artist
ically built of stones which are to
be found here in abundance. Neat
ly trimmed lawns surrounded the
residences."'' The ' "buildings "were
v ujauv curies ui area l lecture:
built at an even distance from the
street, and painted in colors that
blended with.-, the surrounding
country. Flowers were every
where. Light colored ones were
near dark colored walls; ' none of
red were planted near red' walls.
The view was a pleasant one. The
quietness was a perfect rest cure
for tired nerves. On the west side
of the city, and hidden by the pine
trees, was a large sanitarium, filled
to overflowing with patients, who
came here to inhale the healing
ofl.ira nf thft rinps anH t(i oriirw tVio
t
peaceful surroundings. The throbb
ing of the engine at a mill, and the
whistle of a locomotive, were the,
only evidences of daily toil and
business activity. The tourists walk
ed a few blocks to the south, and .
rested in the shade of the large"
pine trees in the park surrounding
the Santa Fe reservoir. They en
joyed the view of Bill Williams,
and decided to. ride to its -summit, -
wj-ihju is ilia uiu&i . perieqi, kuuwu -volcanic
cone in existence, and
from whieh five states may be seen.
On Vheir return they saw the school '
houses, and commented . favorably
on their size and stability. The
attractions of the play grounds
were not overlooked. They could
judge the character of the resident
by the importance given to the
education of the children. They
visited a mill, saw a train load of
logs unloaded, given their hot wa
ter bath, drawn up an incline, and
placed before the saws which con
vert them into various sizes of lum
ber, and stored in different rooms.
A box factory wa3 a great surprise.
Almost-human, modern machinery,
was there, and the men who oper-'
ated the machinery worked as if
they were a part of it. Out into
the lumber yard they went, where
thirty five million feet of lumber
was piled, ready for shipment to
the four corners of the earth. Hun
dreds of ties were piled near the
railroad, ready for transportation
