legislation of any kind, whether at
Washington or at a State capital or in

together.
The greatest trouble with the potato
industry In Kentucky so far as quality
goes in the custom of using small tubers
for seed, according to F. E. Merrlman,
of Kenton county, who led the potato
discussion before the county agents
conference last Thursday. Like produces
like. When dwarf seed are planted the
proportion of small potatoes in a hill is
large. When the largest specimens
from the most prolific hills are planted,
large potatoes are the result. When a
farmer planta small potatoes the seed
is bound 10 "run out," he declared.

Ill complimenting our good friend
Walker, Editor Saulley takes a dig at

might havo mentioned that Lancaster

ly hasn't forgotten that.
Green Clay Walker, county attor
ney of Garrard, und moving picture
show magnate of that delightful little
village, Lancaster, located just over
the north Lincoln boundary, was in
town to secure a film from local Mana
ger C. Haya Foster, of the Stanford
opera house, as his own missed train
connection and did not arrive in time.
Mr. Walker waa kept busy while here
receiving congratulations from his
many Lincoln friends upon his recent
marriage.'
NOW THIS SOUNDS GOOD.
The enterprising citizens of Lancas
ter have adopted the plan of having
several "big days" In the spring and
fall, and they are made so entertaining
that people come to the city from all
parts of Garrard and neighboring coun
ties. Last Monday an automobile and
other valuable prizes were given away
and there was much excittment in the
contest. The plan serves well to bring
the people together and likewise brings
much busineai to the merchants. They
know how to do things in that hustling
city. Danville Messenger.
We wish to thank our good friend
and the Records good friend, Mrs. W.
B. Moss, for The Record of June 3rd.
This la not the first time she has come
to our assistance in this matter and we
are truly grateful.and also sppreciative
of the fact that she prizes each Issue

KAUFFMAN BILL
PASSES HOUSE.
In the passage of the Kauffman Anti
trust Bill by 79 to 5 the House fulfilled
another Democratic platform pledge,
making three in all that have been re.
deemed by it since the present session
or me Kentucky Legislature began.
the bill was taken up as a special
order of business and consumed but
little time. The only person who ad
dressed the House on the measure was
II. C. Kauffman, of Garrard county, its
author, who briefly outlined its provis
ions, and concluded with the statement
that it had the unqualified backing of
the Governor.
Glover Carv, of McLean countv. of-
fered aeveral amendments, all lending
to strengthen the measure and accepta
ble to Mr. Kauffman, which were
adopted. Only five Representatives
voted against the bill.
The friends of Mr. Kauffman, here
in his home town, are iustlv proud of
the record he is making in the legisla
ture and the stand be has taken with
the Governor in carrying out the plat
form pledzes. The bill is a nonular ona
and will pass the Senate by a handsome

GOVERNOR SAYS
Jail A Core For Bootleggers.
In refusing to grant a pardon to Geo.
A. Riddle, of Union County, aentencad
to ten days in jail for selling liquor ina
local option territory. Governor Stanley
issued a statement in which he stands
firmly upon his original attitude in re
gard to local option.
In this statement he says:
"As a candidate I repeatedly assert
ed my hearty concurrence in this set
tlement of a vexed problem which has
so long disturbed the councils of de
liberative bodies and delayed the en
actment of much-needed, progressive
legislation. I was nominated upon a
platform which indorsed this law and
set th-j seal of Its approval upon it as
a deliberate and final determination of
the whole matter.
"The bootlegger may reimburse his
losses in the form of fines by the suc
cessful operation of his illegal business
afler they are imposed. Incarcerated
in the county jail he will have abundant
time and opportunity to consider the
nature and character of his olfense and
those who are more fortunate, but
equally quilty. will find in him an ex
ample of what they, too, may expect
after detection and conviction.
"The request for the remission of the
jail sentence in this case is, therefore.
reiuseu.
