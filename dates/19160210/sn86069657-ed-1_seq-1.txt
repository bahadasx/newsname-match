county court t.8tanton Monday,
and a vdte wlT. be taken in about
sixty days toiotermino whother
or not" the people of the cdunty
will havo goosj rbads bailr.
This is tho third timo thatsuoh
a petition, has .been circulated,
the first one being, faulty in that
it contained the names of. other
than properly owners, and the
second one being killed after be
ing prcsented to the court and
the date for te election Set, by
failure to advertise, this boing
due to the four! order being
wrongly drawn up. This petition
however, is" correctly drawn, and
tho court order was likewise cor

at this time but that, it will be
voted on and pass by a good ma
jority. f
Several of (hose interested in
better roads for our county have
put in a great deal of work in
getting this issue before the peo
ple and a groat deal of credit is
due them. Those who, perhaps,
took thelarcest share of the work
of circutatinghe petition were

grud, who looked after, the lower
end of the county-; T. E. Burgher
and J. M. Kennotf, who worked
this section, and Dr. I. W. John'
sou, of Stanton, who has been an
indefatigable worker in. the up
per end. There are many others,
also, who devoted considerable
timo to this, but these men ap
pear to have taken the greatest
interest,' and to them u larger
measure of credit is due.
Stanley Refuses to
Pardon Bootlegger
Governor Stanley lust week
refused to grant a pardon to
George M. Kiddle, of Union coun
ty, convicted of bootlegging and
sentenced on two counts to pay
a tine and servo ten days in jail
on each count. Kiddle was a
personal friend of Governor
Stanley's, and fully expected to
be pardoned. In refnping to
graut executive clemency Gov
ernor Stanley said that his in ten
tion was to soe that tho oxistsng
liquor laws were enforced, as far
us' they concerned him, and ho
believed that only by so doing,
could the joul value of tho local
option laws be brought out. He
also stated that he believed jail
sentence to be much mora effect
ive as deterrents than lines would
be, and gave the. impression that
it would bo no use for auyono to
ask a pardon for a breach of tho
liquor laws.

Leasing Oil Lands
Up at Stanton Monday practic
ally every landowner from the
upper end of the county was
busy talking about, the prospects
tor oil in that section. In appears
that nearly all the avail ible land
has been leased for drilling pur
poses by various oil compunies,"
and the sinking of test wells is
being awaited with great inter
est. Machinery is now being
brought in and a number of wells
are being planned. Should the
field develop into a valuable dno,
it will meau a great deal to the
county, and wo trust that sever
al good wells will bo located be

WALTERSVILLE,
Why You Should Vote
For The Road Bonds
There aro many reasons why
every citizen of the county should
voto in favor of the road bosdsi,
and wo think that nearly all who
use our roads realize that somo-.
thing should be done. Only si
few days ago we heard a phys
ician who has practised in thie. .
county for a number of years and
who is held in tho greatest esteem
by Ilia fellow citizens, state that
if tho bonds wero not voted and
no road 8 wero built, that ho
would be compelled to leave Pow
ell county and go el ewhero. And
who could blamihim for his ac
tion should he leavo here? Wc
happen to know that only a few
nignts ago this same phystcixn
answered a call that demanded
immediate attention and neary
Inst his life in struggling through
some of the mudholes on one f
the most traveled roads in the
county.
Then, again, we noticed one of
our best farmers, who each year
raises a crop of tobacco, trying to
get that crop to market. Ah
every ono knows, there are cer
tain tiaies when tobacco must be
put on the market if it is to bring
ttiVbeftt price, and this man bad
to hirear extra. team-4nd driver
to get bis load (b whor the Clark
couuty pike adjoins this county.
We don't know what ho paid fur
this extra tenm but from seeing
the shape they were in on their
roturn we venture to say that if
was more than the extra road tax
would amount to. To the aver
age farmer who has just the ordi
nary amount of traveling to do
on the roads, the extra taxes, on
account of the bonds would bo
no more than tho oxtra wear
and tear is now on his wagons
and teams.
Think it over and if you are
opposed to the issuanco of bonds
to build pikes in Powell county
como to our office uud wc will tell
you twenty more good reasons
why you should bo iu favor of
pikes.
