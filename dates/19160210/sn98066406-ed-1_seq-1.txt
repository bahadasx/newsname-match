The Direct Primary for Yale
On Friday, the lKth day of February,
a special election will be held in Vale
for the purpose of ascertaining the
will of the electors on the proposition
of whether or not candidates for all
elective oflices in the City of Vale shall
hereafter be nominated by direct vote.
In order that there may be no misun
derstanding on the part of our citizens
aa to the purpose of this election and
the function of the primary we give
this brief explanation:
We now have in Michigan a direct
primary for the. nomination of l'reei
dent, U. S. Senators, Members of Con
gress and all state, legislative, and
county oflieerB, yet the townships and
many cities of the state, the city of
Vale being among the latter, have been
lax abont adopting the primary system
of nomination. It would seem to us
that a measure receiving the stamp of
approval for nomination of candidates
for the more important oflices within
the gift of the electorate, could be
profitably employed iu flic nomination
of our city oilicials.
To apply the primary to Vale would
accomplish the following good results:
In the past, under the caucus system,
as everyone knows, if a voter wanted a
voice in the nomination of party can
didates it was necessary for him to at
tend a ward caucus one night, at which
caucus the ward candidates, such as
alderman and constable were nominat
ed, and later, on another night, attend
a city caucus, at which the city of
licers such as mayor, clerk, supervisor
and treasurer were nominated. In
view of the fact that the caucuses al
ways came in March (generally on the
worst nights in the month) it took a
patriot, indeed, to stem a March gale
for two or three hours at the 1 eed
Uarn or at the places in the wards des
ignated for holding the ward caucuses
lor the purpose of assisting in the
nomination of his party candidates.
In the rast. owing to the inclemency
of the weather and the hours at which
the caucuses were held, a large num
ber of our citizens found it iuconven
ieiit to attend, feeling that the sacritice
was greater than their, duty in the
premises. This was especially true of
many of our older citizens whose health
was Buch that they did not feel "up" to
engaging in the "Iree-for-all" at a city
caucus.
Under the primary system this sacri
fice on the part of the electors will be
dispensed with, as the primary will be
held on the first of March; the names
of the candidates of the various parties
will be printed on the ballots, (being
placed thereon by petition) and any
time during that day the voter, at his
convenience, can go to the polls, cast
his vote and go about bis business.
Now as to the expense of the primary.
Under the old system each party held
caucuses in the three wards and a city
caucus. The expense of paying rental
in the places in the wards where the
caucuses were held was double the cost
of four inspectors who would conduct
the primary at the council chambers.
The most wholesome benefit, how
ever, to be derived from the direct
primary would be the elimination of
mob rule. How often have we seen
the annual Feed Earn caucus stamped
ed by a mob, in many cases containing
a goodly percentage of "floaters," who
had no legal right to vote, and would
never attempt to vote at an election,
but who had no scruples against drop
ping a "ticket in the bat" at the caucus
when no one was looking.
We feel that the adoption of the di
rect primary by the citizens of Yale is
a progressive step that should have
been inaugurated a long time ago, and
we heartily urge that all loyal citizens
who have the best interests of the city
at heart, go to the polls on ; the 18th
and vote "Ves" on this proposition.
The following will appear on the
ballot:
"Instructions Make a cross In the
square to the left of the words 'Ves' or
No' on each proposition submitted."
