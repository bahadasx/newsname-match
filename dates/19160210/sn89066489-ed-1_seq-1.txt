'The circumstances surrounding

Senior Notes
We Seniors nre now attempt
ing to be Latin authors. Our
teacher gives us each a picture
and asks us to write a story about
it. That sounds easy, and it
would be if we could write it in
English, 1ut no such easy work
for us. We must use the language
of Caesar and Cicero.
We are not quite so busy now
discussing commencement affairs
but the busy time is coming when
we Seniors will have to spend
most of our time in class meetings.
Junior Notes
Miss Smith cheerfully promises
a written "lesson" in Home Geo
graphy Friday. A "lesson" it
may be, to her and us, as well, for
we just can't remember where the
M. K. & T- runs, or whether the
Wabash is north or south of the
Missouri River.
We're now on Cicero's fourth
oration against Cataline. It is
marvelous how wonderful Cicero
proclaimed himself to be, but we
are doubtful as to the veracity of
his statements.
We never have more than one
chapter and twenty problems in
our Chemistry lesson. For this we
are duly grateful and beg that the
length of our lessons shall not in
crease as does our knowledge."'
Odysseus ! How sweet the
knamel! -Not .so, however, the
study of his adventures,, or the
long, lone written renort which
must be made, or the teat which '
Miss Feoion says is due to us.
