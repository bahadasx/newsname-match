J. E. Bosgs Suggests Mass Meeting in
Each County on February 22.
"Let's all get together and indorse
President Wilson's preparedness poli
cy," said J. E. Boggs, circuit clerk, to
day. "The President has recently
visited St. Louis and Kansas City and
it would be an excellent thing to let
him know whether the people are
backing him or not. Politics should
not enter into this matter ever one
should express himself. A mass meet
ing In each county of the state on
Washington's Birthday seems to me
to be a good plan. Then the resolu
tions should be sent to the President.'
Oklahoma Concert Tickets on Sale.
Tickets for the concert of the
Schmidtonian Glee Club of the Uni-
versit of Oklahoma were given to the
members of the University of Missouri
Glee Club at rehearsal last night for
distribution The members of the local
glee club are to sell the tickets, and
the particular seat desired is to be
reserved through the Missouri Store
or Allen's Music Store. The concert
is for February 14.
For this constructive platform of
improvement, J. P. Hitzler, of Hetz
ler Brothers, butchers and meat pack
ers, told the Commercial Club at its
luncheon today that Columbia should
w ork.
There is little need to argue for
better roads," he said "Several ears
ago the club members ran around
over the count and at Millersburg
donated $100 as a basis for a good
reads fund. The road there now is
almost as good as could be had.
"Good roads and an electric rail
road will be weapons with which Co
lumbia merchants can combat the
mail-order houses and will mean
bringing the Universit enrollment up
to 5,000 students.
"I do not agree with some persons
who think a good railroad here would
take business to other cities. Co
lumbia is situated so nearly in the
center of the state that good railroad
connections will mean pulling busi
ness into tiie town rather Mian pulling
it away from here.
"The merchants themselves are to
hTSTile-lf they" don't gcrthe business
from the mail-order houses Start
mail-order houses here and de
mand our share of the trade."
Mr Hetzler advocated a cheaper
rate on motor power from the cit
clee'nc plant
"I believe the increased use of
power at a lower rate would make up
for the reduction in price. I under
stand power can be manufactured in a
plant like ours for 1 cent a kilowatt
hour. 1 am in favor of selling it at 2
cents for motor use "

This was the opinion expressed b

fore the Columbia Commercial Club
toda a noon to indorse Mr Stephens
for the office
Maor J M. Batterton suggested to
tiie dub that Mr. Stephens had been

win. The Columbia Commercial Club,
he thought, should go on record In
favor of the Columbia man for the
office
D. A. Uobnett movd that Mr. Steph
ens be indorsed The motion was sec
onded by Air. Batterton. The objec
tion was raised that the Commercial
Club should keep out of politics,
though all present favored the Co
lumbia man for the governorship.
E S Stephens told the club that,
speaking for his father, he felt sure
'he spirit which prompted the pro
posed indorsement would be appre
ciated. "But there is not a chance in
the world of his being a candidate for
the office," he said.
With the consent of his second, Mr.
Robnett then wi hdrew his motion.

Cannot Be Cleaned Always.
"We might as well use a little com

cleaning ordinance," said Ma or J.
M. Batterton this morning. "A man
wouldn't have had time to do any
thing else if he had kept the snow off
his walk the last week," he continued.
and even then a hammer and a chisel
would have been required."
But by this the major did not)
mean that the ordinance would not
be ci-forced. Bather, he intimated that
when it was possible for the walks to
be cleaned with reasonable effort the
police would probabl have something
to 'jv and do.
