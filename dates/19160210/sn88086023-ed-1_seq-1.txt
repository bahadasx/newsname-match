Some of the locul rarmi-rs who helti
j their Iflfi wheat crops until alter
I January l for higher prices received
a most rude awnkening when they
consulted with Thau T, Bweek, dep
uty internal revenue collecor., upon
the making out of the return blanks
I for their Income tax. They learned
that mottey received from wheat sold
after Janu. 1, stould not be in-
1 eluded KJ lala income.
At first reading the lull Import ol
i this is not apparent Uut hark to
(he
explanation. The cost of grow-
i Inn the 1915 cro. must be included ; g
In the 115 return as the expenses!)
were incurred during Ihe year In- ,
asmuch as the money from the tale I
ol the lalo crop was not received
until after the close of the year, It
must be Included next year on the
1916 return and, listen, it must be
scheduled, every cent of it, as income,
and taxed accordingly.
For example, say a rarmer raises
120,000 worth of wheat and does not
sell until after January 1. Say his
expense for raising the wheat wan
1 12.000. This would have left a net
Income of 13000 to be taxed under the
federal Income tax law had the wheat
been disposed of during the year in
which it was grown. However, it was
I not disposed of until sometime dur-
ing January and. therefore, the full
