the friends of Supreme Conrtini
tice Hughes insist on grooming
him as a presidential possibility.
Justice Hughes is, perhaps, one
of the best equipped men yet

we believe that he hasf tod"much
sense to resign his place on ' the'
bench of the country's highest
tribunal for the uncertainties of
a political contest. Being a man
of keen perception, Justice Hugh
es knows that not hing short of a
revolution can prevent the reel
ection of Woodrow Wilson.
Of course, there' is Theodore
Roosevelt, irrepressible and eter
nal. It is almost a foregone con
elusion that he will disturb the
political world with his candida
cy and will probably make a
i most spectacular race for the
nomination which now seems
within hV'igrasp.- As a matter
of fact, eliminating Ju stice Hugh
es, the Republican Progressive
forces are' sadly, short of presi
dential material and the Bull
Moose seems to be their one best
bet at the present time. While
it is true that the noisy Roose
velt baa nothing to hope for in
the South, which will go solidly
for Wilson, certain conditions a
mong the German-Americans in
the north, east and Middle-West
will cause Roosevelt to poll a
heavy vote, in the event of his
nomination at Chicago. The hy
phenated'fraternity, overlooking
Roosevelt's repeated onslaughts
on its members and . on their
country, seems to have made up
its mind that Woodrow W ilson
is the inveterate foe of Germany
and all thatGermany represents.
Whether or not the tide of Amer
ican patriotism and the spirit of
America's loyal citizenship are
strong enough to override these
undercurrents, and we hope they
are, remains to be seen.
In any event, Theodore Roose
velt can be counted ui on to to
rn e n tithe German disruption
should he see any prospect of
beneflttherein.-AshevilleCitizen.

HOW THE GREAT 6DEST CAME TO CONRAD THE' COBBLER.
EDWIN MARKHAM
While the cobbler mused, there passed his pane
A beggar drenched by the drivjng rain.
H called him in from the stony street
And gave him shoes for his bruised feet.
The beggar went and there came a crone,
Oer face with wrinkles of sorrow sown.
A bundle of fagots bowed her back,
And she was spent with wrench and rack. ,
He gave her his loaf and steadied her load
As she took her way on the weary road.
Then to his door came a little child,
Lost and afraid in the world so wild,
In the big, dark world. Catching it up,
He gave it the milk in the waiting cup,
And led it home to its mother's arms,
Out of the reach of the world's alarms.
The sun went down in the crimson west
And with it the hope of the blessed guest,
And Conrad sighed as the world turned gray:
"Why is it, Lord, that your feet delay?
. Did You forget that this was the day?"
Then soft in the silence a voice he heard:
"Lift up your heart, for I kept my word.
Three times I came to.your friendly door;
Three times my shadow was on your floor.
I was the beggar with bruised feet; '
I was the woman you gave to eat;
I was the child on the homeless street,!"

It is well said, but what will be-

How will the stump orator of the

age among the existing speci
mens of ancient almanacs are
some composed in the fourth cen
tury. They are Roman church
calendars, giving the names of
the saints and other religious in-1

The Baltic nations, who were
not versed in papyris making,
had calendars engraved on ax
helves, walking sticks and other
articles of personal use. The days
were notched with a broad mark
for Sunday, and the saints' days
were symbolized in various devi

entine's, and so oh. The Saxon
almanacs are numerous and con

It is poHsible to trace in these
curious records all the changes of
popular belief and taste. They
were prepared to meet the cur

!tJ Govenor Hewlmd for lodfi !
A bill recently Introduced by
Congressman Webb, is now before
Congress, providing for the re'
tireraent of federal district judg
es at 70 years of age. Its passage
would mean the early retirement
of Judge Boyd, of the Western
District of North Carolina. In
view of this probable vacancy on
the federal bench, it is now in or
der for the people to suggest a
suitable man to fill the position,
as the "voice of the people"
should be heard by the Washing
ton authorities where the ap
pointment is made.
In Hon. W. C. Newland Cald
well county has a citizen who is
eminently fitted in every way for
this office. He has been actively
and successfully engaged in the
practice of law for thirty yeare
having at one time during that
period served as prosecuting at
torney in this district. In vari
ous non-partisan campaigns for
the social uplift and betterment
of the state at large, he has al
ways been an active, vigorous
and effective worker. His services
to his party iu county, state and
nation has been loyal and of a
high order. He has worn worthi
ly different honors at the hands
of his party, but they have been
largely honors only nothing sub
stantial. The federal judgeship
offers fair remuneration in addi
tion to honor. The western dis
trict does not contain a man bet
ter qualified for this office, or
more worthy of it, than Hon. W.
C. Newland, of Lenoir. Should
the bill become a law, Gov, New
land's friends will press him for
the appointment. Lenoir Topic.
Here's hopin' that should the
change be made, Watauga's good
friend, W. C. Newland, will bo the
winner. He is evidently well qual
ified for the position, and no one
more richly deserves it than he.
