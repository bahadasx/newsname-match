ATHENS, Greece, Jan. 1 (B
Mail.) At last the warriors have got
down to using clubs. Just ordinary
clubs, for graining men. The Austro
German soldiers are supplied witU
bludgeons and on parts of the British
front the ally soldiers have been fur
nlhed clubs covered with spikes
These British clubs look much Ilk-?
the big stick American cartoonists
ned to picture T. H. using. The cluU
are for isse by troops entering trench
es on the sly and slaying noiselessly
no that men in other parts of the
trench don't know what is going on
One of the newest mipsilcs in the
great war is a huge shell the Ger
mans threw at the Dardenelles. Only
tilr guns could throw the shell with
out exploding It, and these new air
guns must be ten inches in bore and
many feet lnng. One of thrtse big
shells which fell in the British line
u:iexploded has been taken apart by
txperts. It was ten inches in diame
ter and fifteen inches high, made of
sheet steel with wooden plug-disks ai
each end. This big steel can contain
ed "fi pieces of scrap iron and 25
pounds of tri nitro toluol. Tho ,mis
fcile weighing 51 pounds. The firing of
the big shell must have been touchy
work Imagine a fire cracker ten
inches thick, what would blow a hole
In the earth six feet deep and ten feet
ill diameter. Imagine yourself facing
the duty of lighting the fuse on this
r.rmnnni! cracker and then, white th"
fuse was sputtering, placing the
cracker in the mouth of a giant air
pun and firing the gun in time to get
the cracker out of your neighborhood
before it went off.
Most hand bombs don't go off by
contact. They must be lighted first
und then thrown. Sometimes the light-'
ing In done with a match or a cigarot;
other times by pulling a little string
which rubs two strips of sulphur to
gether somewhere In the handle of the
bomb Both sides in the great war
have bombs of various sorts for var
ious reeds. If the enemy is coming,
for instance, you must have a bomb
that wijl explode quickly; if you're
rushing toward him you need a bomb
that you can throw far ahead and
Ihnt will have clone its Job by the
time you reach the scene.
The French have the fasteRt hand
J.omh known. The thrower wears a
leather thong on his wrist and a hook
on this thong is attached to a hook
on the bomb. The art of throwing
llfehts the fuse, which Is so short ami
so quick burning that the explosion
is almost immediate.
The slowest bomb, perhaps, is th;
Servian. It is shaped like a pocket
whisky flask, nock, stopper and all,
and is jdI iron and bras. The throw
er unscrews the brass top, hits a fir
ing pin on a stone or tho butt of his
rifle and then, after a space of sev,en
seconds, throws it. The bomb throb
in the man's hand Just before it is
due to explode, giving him warning
If he throws the bomb too soon tho
other follow may pick it up and throw
It back at h'.m. Bomb experts figure
that any soldier can pick up a lighted
hand bomb nnd throw it away from
himself if ho has five seconds to
spare.

CHIEF ASKS
CITIZENS TO
HELP HIM
Chief of Police Phillios wants the
citizens pf Chickasha to aid him in
enforcing the ordinances of the city,
particularly .itreet traffic regulations.
In a statement Issued for publication
today, he says:
"To the Citizens of Chickasha:
"I invite you to report any and all
violations of the traffic laws which
may come within your observation.
My request is based on two reasons.
"First. I want to enforce the law. I
want the persons who conipiaia about
the law violations to do their share
in punishing or preventing these vio
lations. "How far r.nd what efforts you will
lend us is a question. It is muc'i
easier to kick about offenses and de
nounce the administration and offend
ers than It is to report them and aid
in their conviction. The average
American is reluctant to forego bis
prerogative of kicking, but he like
wisp is loath to figure as a 'tattler'and
yet, as a good citizen, he has an obli
gation to assist to the limit of hi
ability in the enforcement o? tho law.
Jhe statutes recognize constabulary
service on brief notice.
"Many evils flourish because the
only available witnesses against them
hesitate to offer testimony. Securing
testimony against gambling joints and
bawdy houses is almost impossible, al
though persons qualified to give evi
dence, are among the most frequent
coniplainers against these evils. It is
a matter of general observation
that a householder will hear
a neighbor's violation of the
sanitary code, even when these viola
tions become a menace to the com
munity's health, rather than take the
initiative in securing their abate
ment. "It Is true that the citizen, whose
zeal for law enforcement leads him
to report infractions of ' the law, is
often rebuked by the very authorities
intrusted with the responsibilities of
law enforcement. Such things have
happened often, here in Chickasha.
As a general proposition, however,
the good citizen shies at hir- own ob
ligation and, unless tempted by tan
gible reward, avoids any semblance
of assistance in the daily work of ap
prehending and punishing law-break
ers.
"Now, I hone, in time, to win the
co operation ot the general public,
tut am afraid to expect too much.
"BEN F. PHILLIPS.
Chief of Police."
