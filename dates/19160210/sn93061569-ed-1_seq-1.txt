New Standard Linotype is

The above is a picture of the new
Linotype Machine that has just been

this addition to our already well

confession here and that is this.
When we came to Clayton and bar
gained for the Citizen office, we had
, in mind a small country newspaper
Offioesuch as we owned and operated
across the Panhandle in Oklahoma.
Our plans were to have our brother
"Jimmie," who is is our foreman at the
present time, to take charge of the
mechanical part of the office and do
all of this work and that I, Yours
Truly, was going to add a side line
to our duties as Editor. We had great

OBITUARY
Robert M. Hight, who was laid to
rest on last Sunday afternoon in the
cemetery here, followed by a large
concourse of friends and relatives,
was one of the most popular and well
liked citizens of his community.
He was born August the 2nd,1857, at
Geneva, 111., and passed out last
Thursday morning at 6 a. m. He
went to Kansas when a boy of eleven
years of age in the early days of that
state when pioneering was the order
of the day.
He was married to Miss Sallie
Craig in 1882 and to them were born
two children, a son, T. D. Hight of
Thomas, N. M., and a daughter, Mrs.
Walter Johnson of this city. During
his residence in Kansas he was active
ly engaged in political work and as
sisted Senator Fitzpatrick in conduct
ing state affairs for several years.
His personality was such that he really
made friends wherever he went and
inspired confidence in his associates
to such extent that he was a very
valuable assistant to the Senator.
After the country in which he lived
so. long became settled he decided to
come on west and settled in New Mex
ico on a homestead near Thomas, N
M. in 1907 on which he made proof.
Two years after his arrival here
his wife passed away leaving him very
lonely and his little grandson Rob'
bie Johnson, who is also his name'
sake, has been his faithful and de
voted companion ever since. He leaves
a large host of friends to mourn his
loss as well as a daughter, Mrs Walter
Johnson of this city, a son, T.' D,
Hight, of Thomas, three step sons,
R. H. Craig of Longton, Kansas, J,
F. Craig of Manzanola, Colo., J. R.
Craig of Cushing Okla.,' two sisters,
Mrs.. Margaret Young of Oak Valley
Kansas, Mrs.' Mattie Gillispia .of Elk
City, Kansas, and five brothers, E.
Hight, of Independence, Kansas,
A. Hight of Thayer, Kansas, A. N.
Eight of Modesa Kansas, George
Hight of Lafontine Kansas and ,
H. Hight of Oak Valley Kansas, be
sides a great many grandchildren, one
of whom will miss him more than can
be told in words, as he was passion
ately devoted to his grandfather and
would make any sacrifice to please
him.
Mr. Hight was kind and affectionate
father, a staunch and loyal friend

Mission Theater Has Grand Opening
The above is a picture of. the New ,
Mission Theatre that made its bow
to the public on Monday night, Feb.
7th, and took its place as one of the
most magnificent Auditoriums in the
entire southwest. Long before the
time set for the doors to open, the
spacious portico was jammed full to
the extent that when the doors open
ed those that had reserved seat
tickets were held back for a consid
erable length of time before being
able to enter the auditorium at the
time the doors opened. 'Mrs. Guntz
and Mr. Earle, in charge of the tick
ets at the window, certainly were on
the rush to accommodate those who
were anxious to get inas it was
evident long before all were in that
the room would not hold the crowd.
vThe house was filled to overflowing.
The city and county turned out en-
masse to witness the opening exer
cises and to be counted among the
ndmber that should be present when
the first curtain was rolled upj When
all was ready, the house was filled,
and every one in watchful waiting,
the lights were turned on and the cur
tains raised andjthc first sight that
met the gaze of the anxious specta
tors was a trio of the leading citi
zens of the town, the Hon. O. P.
Easterwood, who was to make the
opening address, Hon. Juan Duran,
who was to follow him in Spanish, and
P. Mr. Morris Herzstein, the owner of
M.'the new building. Both addresses
Hog ography Just As Important As
Geography, Says Supt. Merstelder
It is just as important for the young
folks who live in the country to learn
something about the successful meth
ods of farming and stock raising as it
is for them to know the name of a
small river in South Africa or the
family history of some Roman war
rior. That is what State Supervisor L. C.
MersfeMer, of the department of in
dustrial education, is telling the teach
ers of New Mexico in a printed cir
cular issued today.
To call attention to some of the
problems which are being dealt with
today through the industrial clubs
that are being organized under the
supervision of the state and nation,
Mr. Mersfelder has propounded nine
questions for consideration of teach
ers throughout New Mexico. These
questions tend to emphasize the point
that "an education is a preparation
for complete living." The questions
are the following: ,
1. Why have some of our town
and city schools been so much more
successful than others in keeping in
school, boys and girls who apparently
had lost interest in the ordinary text
book work?
2. Why are so many of our young
men upon leaving our public schools
unable to secure and hold a good
position while others have no trouble
in securing and filling with credit a
position as stenographer, bookkeeper,
carpenter, or making a success on the
farm t '

weighs 75 pounds while his neighbor
across the road has raised a pig the
same age that weighs 150 pounds?
4. What accounts for the fact that
one farmer's wife has hens laying 60
eggs each, per year while her neigh-

were well directed and to the point
and were made short for reason of
the many things that should follow.
The house then called for Mr. Herz
stein and amid much cheering and con
siderable embarassment on the part
of Mr. Herzstein, he came forward
and made his bow to the public as
a recognition of their appreciation''
Manager Earle was somewhat hand
icapped by reason of the fact that his
pictures had not come in time to try
them out and that the machine being
new and not having had time to ad'
just it, the pictures were omitted and
gave way to the A. S. Lewis Comedy
Co., who were booked to play for the
week, opening with ."The Girl in the
Game."
Through the kindness of Manager
Lewis of the Company, two shows
were put on, the extra one to take
the place of the pictures that were to
have been shown.v The evenings ener
tainment was enjoyed by all and the
event is one long to be remembered
by the citizens of the town.. Among
some of ..the other features of the
evening that attracted attention was
the two young sons of Mr. Herzstein,
who were attired in evening dress and
distributed the programs at the door.
The two plays that were put on by
the Company were well rendered and
much enjoyed by all, and the appre
ciation of the house was shown by
many cheers." "The Company has been
hero throughout the week and have
made many friends and met with the
approval of the amusement lovers of
thi twn.' '
bor has hens laykfc 120 eggs annu
ally? '
6. Why do some farmers plant a
very poor grade of seed corn, wheat,
etc., and harvest a poorer grade while
other farmers plant nothing except a
good variety of well tested seed and
consequently reap a much more boun
tiful harvest in return?
6. Why do some farm houses have
poor doors, no screens, shabby out-
houses and barns, while other places
present fust the opoosite appearance?
7. Uhy does one girl make a shab
by appearance in a dress that cost her
8.00 while her companion may look
neat and tidy in a dress that cost pos
sibly Y' f that amount?
8. ' " v is it that many of our
women can prepare a wholesome and
appetizing meal at a moderate cost
and in a minimum time while there
are others who have cooked three
meals a day for seven days in the
week for fifty-two weeks in the year
for twenty-seven years and cannot
possibly cook a pan of bread that is
attractive and pleasing to either eye,
nose or stomach, although she may
have at her disposal all the groceries
in New Mexico and all the tl.ue she
wishes? ; .
9. Why is it that some fanners
have fruit and fresh corn and beans
and peas and potatoes and berries and
the like to eat and to spare and to rot'
during a few months of the year, and
then for the remainder of the time
either do without thrfe vsry necw

MEXICO'S MILLION-ACRE FARMS
In the United States the fanner is
an humble person; in Mexico he is a
king of millionaries: You look out
across a level plain and see a magni
ficent house of stone, cement and great
timbers, covering, Sometimes, as much
as half an acre. Surrounding it are
other houses, hundreds of them, but
all small, constructed of adobe, brush,
or even of canestalks.
You are not looking at a town, but
at a ranch settlement. In the great
house lives the hancendado and his
family. In the little houses live the
peons.
The typical farm in Mexico is not of
one hundred and sixty acres, but of a
million. A major fraction of the agri
cultural and grazing lands of Chihua
hua is owned by one family. Lower
California, equal in size to Alabama,
is nearly all held by five great cor
porations. .
The million-acre farms lie mostly
fallow. Mexico does not produce
enough corn and beans to feed her
own peon population. Modern ma
chinery is needed but modern machin
ery will never be used extensively s
long as the peon is so cheap that prim
itive methods are cheaper than ma
chine methods-Kelley Crane, in
