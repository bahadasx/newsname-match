Hotel Proposition
A meeting of the subscribers to
the Motel Oregon bonus was held
Tuesday afternoon and a committee
consisting of Messrs. Reed and V. O.
N. Smith, who will choose not to ex
ceed three others, were authorized to
care for the interests of the sub
scribers in caring for the bonus.
The committee who raised the
bonus announce that a most ready
response was made to their request
for funds and that considerable more
than the needed $1800 was subscrib
ed. This fact emphasizes the new
spirit which Is becoming a great force
in Ashland's projects and should be
very gratifying to the entire city.
When the bonus matter is cleared up
it may be possible to refund a por
tion of the subscriptions on a pro
rata basis.
The subscriptions were secured
upon the agreement that the amounts
were to be paid when the hotel own
ers had expended $15,000 In remodel
ing the hotel so as to make it an up-to-date
hostelery. When satisfactory
evidence of this has been given the
committee the subscriptions will bej
collected.

bonus follows:

Beet Factory To
Be at Grants Pass
The beet sugar factory will be lo
cated at Grants Pass probably on a
50-acre site Just across the river from
the city. Final announcement of the
location came as an answer to an
offer from the Medford Commercial
club who agreed to guarantee, the
(-sugar interests 5000 acres If they
would build at Medford.
The Salt Lake men wired back
that the first factory would be lo
cated at Grants Pass but that they
hoped to build another factory in
the valley next year when a supply
of seed from Russ'b and Austria
could be secured.
One year contracts for beets are
now being accepted by the company
it being their aim to increase the
beet acreage to 7000 acres. The con
tract for the Grants Pass factory
has been let and construction will be
rushed.
The factory will be of a 700-ton
per day capactiy and will have all
the modern improvements. It will
furnish employment for a big crew
of workmen and will be ready for
operation on September 1 of thie
year. The Dyer Company of Cleve
land are the contractors.
Commercial Club

Club Offers Prizes
For Bird Houses
The Civic Improvement club will
offer twenty-five dollars in prizes to
the boys (and girls, if they wish) of
Ashland for the best bird houses con
structed by them. The announce
ment comes as a result of a talk on
birds and descriptions of how they
may be made into friends of a com
munity by Miss Hicks at the Tuesday
Clvio club meeting.
The high school students will be
In one class and the grade children
in another so that the boys may com
pete aga?nst others of their own age
and degree of training. Five prizes
will be offered to the high school
students, one of $2.00, two of $1.50,
and two of $1.00. Fifteen prizes to
the grade children, one of $2.00, four
of $1.50, and ten of $1.00. The com
petition will not be restricted to
school children as any boys in town
many enter.
Prof. Harmon of the high school
will furnish plans to those desiring
them, although many will prefer to
use their own plans. Older people
who wish to aid a good work will
also receive plans for construction of
bird houses by applying to Mr. Har
mon. At a date to be announced later all
of the bird houses will be exhibited
at an exhibit and townspeople given
an opportunity to purchase them.
Many have already assured those In
charge of their desire to purchase
bird houses and sale of all those con
tributed should be easy. The prize
winning houses will become the prop
erty of the club.
Every boy and most of the girls
of Ashland can make a little pin
money, learn a little from practical
carpentering experience, and be help
ing to keep in Ashland a host of our
feathered friends by entering this
contest. '
The Ashland Commercial club will
stage an event at the Vlning theatre
some time about the middle of March
which will put any show on the road
in the shade for glittering costumes,
side splitting comedy, pretty girls,
music, songs, and general excellence.
Absolutely the best talent in the
city will be chosen and every part
will be filled by the best suited per
former. The mata feature will be a
comedy with a chorus', specialties,
and other attractions.
A ten-piece orchestra will Xurnish
music. Specialities between the acts
will include dances and musical num
bers. The club needs cash and be
lieves this to be the easiest means
of raising a substantial amount.
The date will be announced later
and all other organizations asked to
keep It clear. Secretary Norris has
been appointed chairman of a com
mittee to manage the affair and will
chose his aides. Manager Bergener
of the Vining theatre has already as
sured Mr. Norris that the club may
have the theatre for an amount which
will pay for lights and heat.

Whom late the nation he had led,
With ashes on har head.

To speak what in my heart will beat

Nature, they say, doth dot
And cannot make a man
Save on some wornout plan,

For him her old world molda aside eh

And, choosing sweet clay from the

Of the unexhausted west,
With stuff untainted shaped a hero
new,
Wise, steadfast in the strength of God

How beautful to see
Once more a shepherd of mankind, in
deed, Who loved his charge, but nover loved

One whose meek flock the people joyed
to tse,
Not lured by any cheat of birth,
But by his clear grained human
worth
And brave old wisdom of sincerity!
They knew that outward

They, could not choose but trust

And supple tempered will
That bent like perfect steel to spring

Thrusting to thin air o'er our cloudy

Broad prairie, rather, genial, level

Fruitful and friendly for all human
