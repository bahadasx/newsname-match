The HERALD
THE RIGHT KIND OF BOOSTER.
K. S, Cheroweth, president of the
Bank of McCraken, Knnsns, wm a
business vliitor in Heaver Momlny.
While litre lie called at tlio lie aid
olllje to look over recent Issues of thu
paper and time Ret an idea of con
dition in thin section. During the'
pant few month a great majority of
the strangers who have como in our
midst have called at the Herald olllco
upon their arrival to look through
recent issues of thin paper and in each
instance they have mentioned the fact
to us that in looking up condition In
a new locality they always relied
principally upon the local newspaper.
Those business men and other, who
might think that the local newspaper,
does not reflect the spirit and life of a (
town to the outsider, might take a tip (
from the carual remarks o f these
stranger in our midst and if they are
not contributing their shnre toward
making the. home paper a live, up-to-date
booster for the community, they
should get busy. Newspaper publlsl -era
are human, just like other people,
and the best sort of booters In the
world, for they liuve the medium of
cireulation for their boosts, when given
the right sort of encouragement by
other business concerns of the town
but it is pretty hard business to boost
one's head ofTfor the town and country
in general when the vast majority of
the business Arms o f the town use
baking powder or axle grease state
ments, send out of town to mall
order concerns for their letter heads
and envelopes and look upon adver
tising ax a free donation to the editor.
Beaver dw't harbor a n y of these
antedeluvian specimens as the columns
of the Herald will attest. Our leading
business concerns are pretty well
represented I n the columns of this
paper and they are not only reaping
the benefit from their advertising but
the paper, a it goes to its large list of
readers each week, is telling to the
people of the entiro county nod to the
outside world that Beaver is one of
tlielivfft little towns on, the rn a p
right now. It pays, In more ways than
one, to advertise.
PROBST ELEVATORNEARING COPLETION.
H. K. Probst, of the Proust Grain
Company, who has been jiere for some
time superintending the building of
the grain elevator for that company,
on the site of the old ootton gin,
informs us this week that the elevator
is coming along as rapidly as possible,
considering the inclemency of the
weather, and that with a few days of
favorable weather they will be enabled
to complete tbe building and be ready
for business. Mr. Probst is a live
wire in grain buying circles and he
tells us that when his elevator is com
plete and ready for business that he
does not intend for a load of grain to
pass Beaver for want of a market here.
Owing to a shortage of cars and no
storage facilities at hand, some grain
has been compelled to go to other
markets the past few weeks, but at
this time it is being pretty well taken
care of. Another week or two will
find the Beaver market adequate to
handle everything comi"g this way.
PAINTER DIES OF PNEUMONIA.
Charles Donley, a painter, who came
to Beaver at the begining of the build
ing boom and who had been employed
here since, having recently built a
small house just south of E. II. Mans
field's residence and was joined by his
wife and family, died early Friday
morning of pneumonia. The remains
wero prepared for Uupment nnu re
turned to the former home at Paw
huska for burial.
The family were in destitute circum
stances but the big hearted people of
Beaver came t o their assistance in
time of need and care'd for the old
gentleman during his illness. Upon
his death County Olerk Uulick circu
lated a subscription paper among our
people and received a donation of 57.
00 to pay the expense of taking the
remains and family back to their old
home.
MRS. HILL HOSTESS TO
ENTRE NOUS CLUB.
The Kntro Nous musical cluo was
entertained at the homo of Mrs. W. G.
Stranathan Monday afternoon Mrs.
Homer Hill whs hoBtess and Mrs.
V. G. Stranathan leader. A miscel
laneous program was rendered follow
ing which a delightful luncheon was
J served by the hostess. Mrs. Or, L h.
Long. Mrs. II, O. Taylor mid Miss
Maude Thomas were guests of theclub.
TWO MORE NEW RESIDENCES THIS WEEK.
Work was commenced the first of
the week on two more new homes on
the West Side, the same being tho
residences o f Claude T. Smith and
Cliff Drum. A. M. Burnam I s alto
building an addition to one of hia rent
al properties.
TRAFFIC REGULATION NEEDED. 1
A runaway occurred on tho street
one dny last week, which might have
proven disastrous. Fortunately, no
serious damage was done, A four
horse team, which had been left stand
ing not hitched and with no one tu
watch it, became frightened and dash
ed up Douglas avenue from the West
Side reed yard the full length of the
street. Two women, who were cross
ing the street, narrowly averted being
struck by the. runaway team and a
number of vehicles and auto, which
were standing along thu street, were
in great danger of being demolished
Providentially there wore no small
children playing in the street, which
is so often the case, particularly at the
south end of the street. Had there
been, It Is nardly possible that they
could have escaped. Wo presume Bea
ver is just like the average small town
and it will take n tragedy to wake u
up, but it does seem that It would I e
better tu "lock the barn door before
the horse is stolen," as It were, and
take somu'steps to prevent these catas
trophes Instead of waiting until some
one is killed or maimed fur life, before
we take action. An ordinance prohib
iting leaving teams on the street with
out being hitched would be opportune
at tills time because of the great num
ber of teams which are pasning up and
duwn the street at all times. Such an
ordinance would necessarily need to
be enforced however to be of much
benefit. And, while wu are talking
about the regulation of trulllo on thu
street, why not have au ordinance
prohibiting reckless and fait driving
of automobiles about town? There
are still a few Smart Alecks who like
to drive a car at break-neck sped
about the streets regardless of whose
life or property teey are endangering,
and they ought to be suppressed. It
Is better to be safe than sorry. Why
not have these ordinances and have
them enforced, NOW?
REVIVAL MEHING IN PROGRESS.
Revival mee(ings are in progress at
the Moftiodist chtirch this we'ek with
Evangelist Perklus, o f Wichita, In
charge. The meetings are being well
attended and it is expected that much
good may result from the effort.
