THURMONT, FREDERICK COUNTY, MD., THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1916.
j “SPUD" MURPHY j
j; _ 18
I
If ever there was a man with a con
tinual "grouch” it was "Spud” Mur
phy. He was always finding fault
with something and it anything
pleased him, instead of being satis
fied, ho would compare it with some
thing else and begin to ‘ growl,” as
tho boys said.
1 first made his acquaintance on
board a United States transport la
Frisco, whore we “rookies” were wait
ing to bo taken to tho Philippines.
He was known as the niggest "growl
er" in the outfit. We finally reached
Manila and were sent out on the line.
"Spud,” as the boys called Murphy,
myself and six more boys went to H
company. We hadn’t been there two
days before "Spud” had a quarrel with
a sergeant and as u result $lO was
docked from his pay to buy new (lags
for the United States. This taught
"Spud” to bo careful, but it didn't slop
his growling.
He said tho funniest things when ho
was mad. Ho never could see any
funny side to them until the follows
would be splitting their sides laugh
ing. Even then someone would have
to show him a diagram of tho joke.
It was he who dubbed the captain
"iiullcr” and tho "top” Jimmy
Wrinkles, and what he didn’t do to
old Casey, the quartermaster, would
he hard to discover. He made a song
about old Casey and sung it to tho tune
"Tim Tooliii.”
It was things like this that made
“Spud" liked by his ollicers, tor ho
had the knack of saying things when
he was mad that put the rest of tho
company in good humor. One time 1
remember was on the Peking hike.
It was that awful day going into Ma
tow. The fellows were nearly "all
in;” it wasn’t a case of strength then
—it was nerve only that held a fellow
in the ranks. All tho fellows were
showing the strain and wei snapping
and barking at one another, it just
seemed as if something must give way,
when "Spud” was seen to forgo ahead.
He cried out, mad as a wolf:"It this
thing is going to be a six-day Madison
square affair I'm going in to win!”
Then as oae man the company lot out
a yell and when the nows traveled
along the line it had the effect of
brightening up the whole outfit. "Mad
ison square" was a standing joke for
a long time after that.
Well, finally it came around that
“Spud" and 1 had but a short time to
serve. Many was the roasting ' Spud"
gave mo. He was sure that 1 would
re-enlist. Ho would start at mo this
way: "Well, ft’s Just two months
now, Jock, and then back to Hod's
country with me; but 1 suppose it
doesn't matter to you, for you're go
ing to ‘take on’ again and boa regu
lar old army stiff like Wrinkles or
Casey." Then I'd give him an argu
ment about the advantages of a fellow
staying in the army and in a few min
utes we would be yelling at each other
until it looked as if wo were going to
fly at each other’s throats.
The final day was at hand for
"Spud." I had still a week to do. Af
ter “Spud" turned in his arms ami
accouterments everybody watted for
guard mount, after which "Spud”
would report at headquarters and re
ceive his "buzzard.” We all got as
near headquarters as we dared, and
as ours was a one-company pest and
our old captain was stiff In command
we looked for a rare treat when "Spud"
and old "Ifuller" should have it out
together. Guard mount was finished
and then "Spud" went over to head
quarters with the gait of a peacock
and all Hie company out to have a
look at him. Well, ho was in there
about ten minutes and there was no
explosion.
Then the door opened and "Spud”
walked out, growling away for dear
life. Seeing the "top” and old Casey
standing at the orderly room door lie
headed straight for them, with all the
company trailing after.
When he got in front of the "top” he
shook his discharge papers in Hie
"top’s” face and shouted: “Is this the
way to treat a man after he has been
In every hike for three years.”
"Why, what's the matter, Murphy?
I thought the captain was going to
give you an excellent character. What
more do you want?”
"That's all right, too, top,” says Mur
phy, ‘ but old 'Duller doesn't want me
in his blank company.”
"How do you know?” chips in old
Casey.
"Why, he told me so," yelled Mur
phy. "1 tried to re-onlist and he told
me I'd have to wait until tomorrow,
as ha couldn't do anything today, be
cause I'm serving today on the old en
listment.”
Then B company went mad and such
cartwheels and handsprings you nev
er saw before. Old Wrinkles couldn't
do anything and only for old "Buller”
coming over I think they'd be yelling
yet.
“Spud” re*eulisted the next day
How He Escaped.
The lawyer was examining him con
cerning his qualifications as a juror.
“Have you ever served on a jury?"
tie asked.
"No, sir,” answered the man. “I’ve
been drawn a good many times, but 1
was always too smart to get caught
on a jury.”
“What's that, sir?” Interrupted the
judge, sternly. "Do you boast of youi
smartness in escaping Jury duty?"
"No, your honor,” said the man. "Not
at all When I said 1 was too smart I
meant that I was always excused be- f
cause the lawyers thought I wasn t ig- ,
noraut enough.”

WHEN LONDON FALLS
GERMAN WRITER FORESEES TRI
UMPHAL ENTRY.
Von Hlndenburg Selected by This En
thusiast to Lead the Kaiser’s
An anonymous German writer has
produced an extraordinary work en
titled "Ilindenburg’s March Into Lon
don,” says tho London Times. Tho
book Is delighting the German popu
lace. Some extracts from the last
chapter of the book, In which the au
thor describes the passage of the vast
German army through the streets o£
the captured capital, follow:
The triumphal entry had been pre
coded by a gnat battle in hich tbe
Germans had d spersed the last levies
of "decadent England." At Croydon
the field marshal Loops in re
view. "Comrades,” ho cries, “we have
the proudest cl.y in the world in our
hands.”
The subdued lights of the Imperial
city arc seen by t' •' v rs as they
camp on the n: .1 before Hie tri
umphal entry i.it< the out t suburbs.
The march ncror l or ’ a bridge be
gins at nine o'clock iu the morning,
lllntlcnburg seated .<•■ bis horse, with
Count Zeppelin at his Bid.*, watches
intently the first regiments r.s they
swing past doing Ik- „o stop, as
if they wore on the paraile ground at
Fierlin. The so! li* rs look curiously at
the docks burning or smoldering from
Zeppelin attacl s. The goal of tho
troops is St. James’ park.
The Wellington and Charing Cross
bridges had been demolished on the
previous day by heavy Gorman artil
lery, and all the tnuiTic, tramways, om
nibuses, tradesmen's vans, cabs and
motor cars are concentrated upon Lon
don bridge. Thousands and thousands
swarm on (ho tops of omnibuses in
order to g( t a glimpse of Hindenbnrg
and tho ‘'linns.” Tho troops march
through King William street to the
“richest place in tho world." that be
tween the Mansion house, the Bank of
England, the Stock exchange. Round
the bank the troops saw an angry mob
clamoring for money.
The lord mayor of the day looks
down upon tho strong, procession
from tho Guildhall hale* ay. unkempt
ami worried looking; members of tho
stock exchange are budde d together,
angry, but curious. Past St. Paul's,
up Fit f t street, along the Strand,
through the Mall into Clubland, tho
conquerors man h.
Mournful clubmen peer out from
their privileged positions In tho club
windows at tho troops. Ilimlenhurg
and snino of tho higher officers visit
the houses of parliament, where,
doubtless to Hindenburg's embarrass
ment, they find a huge life size picture
of the field marshal propped up on
tho historic woolsack. Big Ben. It
seems, had been silent for many
months, but on Illndenburg'B instruc
tions ho strikes tho hours again on
this historic night.
Electrified Pants.
Pants warmed by electricity is the
latest war invention. It Is described
by its originators, an Innsbruck pro
fessor who is at present serving in tho
army, Max Beck by name, and the
well-known Vienna professor of medi
cine, Von Schrotter.
Besides the comfort this garment
would be to men in the trenches in
winter, it is pointed out that electrical
pants and, likewise, an electrical arm
warmer, might bo profitably used in
airships and aeroplanes. It appears
from tho description given that ex
tremely supple but stiff electrical
warming wires are woven in with tho
stuff, which is itself made especially
with a view to insulation. The pants
are put on like any other, and fed
by cables at a distance of a hundred
yards or more.
The wearer can himself connect and
disconnect the heat conductor. Tho
expense is l%d. to Id. an hour. Tho
cost of manufacturo is estimated at
from £3 Gs. Sd. to £4 3s. 4d.
Twenty Years on Job.
Twenty years ago William Schoon
was passing the home of Mrs.
Harry J. Langworthy, wife of a
contractor, 308 Broad street. Staple
ton.
"You’re just the man I want to
see,” she said, halting him. “I want
you to repair a hand mirror for me.”
Schoon took the mirror to his shop
and put it in a chest.
The other afternoon lie returned to
the Langworthy home.
"What brings you here?” she in
quired. “Why, I haven’t seen you in
years."
"Your hand mirror,” lie remarked,
and handed it out simply marked, “25
cents.”
“Why, I forgot nil about it,” ejacu
lated Mrs. Langworthy.
“So did I,” answered Schoon. —New

Beer Glasses to Be Sterilized.
Boiled beer glasses will be the only
ones permitted in the saloons of Mont
clair, N, J„ by an edict of the health
department. Of course, whisky glasses
will come under the same rule.
I'p to the present the barkeepers
have used only cold running water to
clean glasses after use. The health
department believes this treatment la
not sufficient to destroy germs The
new code requires not only that the
glasses shall be washed in boiling wa
ter, but that they shall be rinsed in
cold water afterward.
The Same rule applies to glasses
used at soda fountains.

ISI
A DOUBLE EVENT
i _
"And the right man hasn't turned up
yet, itila?" inquired her brother, tak
ing her hands in his.
"Not yet, Jim,’ answered his sister,
smiling. "Besides, you know, Jim, i
am never going to get married any
way until you do, because there will
be nobody to look after you then.
Jim smiled. ”1 ve been looking after
myself a good deal since 1 came to
New York,' lie answered.
"But anyway, I’m going to stay with
you long enough to put your household
affairs in order and —and sew on all
your buttons, 1 replied the girl.
Since Jim left the little town to take
up a position in the big city Rita aud
worried constantly about him. ana at
last she hud left her mother and gone
to spend a couple of weeks with Jim.
He was taking her for a round of gay
ely. As they entered the big roof
garden hotel Jim looked fondly at his
sister. How pretty she was, and now
fortunate the man would he who got
her! Ho hoped it would be someone
worthy of her.
“L urn always so sorry for boys like
you who are lonely in a great city,’
said Rita, slipping her hand into lus.
Jim winced inwardly. He was think
ing of a certain poker party of a few
nights before, of which Rita would
never have approved, and wondering
if she suspected that he had a good
many friends.
In tho elevator a forlorn-looking
young man was standing. He, too,
was going up to the roof-garden, and
he was going up alone. Rita s heart
smote her.
"He looks as lonely as I imagine you
must be sometimes,” she whispered to
Jim as the elevator stopped "Lei's
ask him to join us.”
Jim looked at the young man. He
was certainly a presentable young fel
low, a gentleman, and a stranger to
tho city, as Jim imagined. 1 hoy hap
pened to approach an empty table to
gether. Jim made some casual re
mark.
"Plenty of room here,’ he said.
The young fellow sat down, and
soon (he three were engaged in con
versation. Jim was not sorry for the
respite from a tete-a-tete with his sis
ter. Ho was dreading the time when
he would have to teli her a very
natural tiling from which, neverthe
less, he shrank —that he was as good
as engaged to a very charming girl.
Miss Ida Campbell.
"By the way, Jim.” said Rita, "do
you remember Ida Campbell? Well,
1 have got her address, and 1 was
thinking of looking her tip. It is
somewhere in Sixty-seventh street.”
The* young man started. "Why,
then she must be my cousin," he said.
"1 am John Campbell. My uncle ami
aunt come from Birniington.”
"Why I have hoard of you!” stam
mered Rita. "How odd; Ida always
used to speak of her city cousin, and
hoped that some day we should meet.
But you have lived iu the city all your
life.”
"Pretty nearly,” said John, smiling.
‘But I thought you were so lonely,
and told my brother to speak to you. l
"Well, 1 am," said the young man,
laughing. "At least, 1 was.'
The ice w as fairly broken, and soon
they were all chatting like old friends,
in the intervals of the performance,
Rita found the young man delightful,
and Jim—well, Jim was pleased, be
cause somehow it seemed to case his
own guilty conscience. But in the
midst of the mirth a thin wisp of
smoke was seen to curl out ol the
side of the stage. A moment later a
thick, black cloud drifted toward the
audience.
"Fire!” shouted somebody.
The stage manager appeared and
held up his hand. "There is no dan
ger!" he said quietly. "Please leave
your seats in an orderly manner and
go toward the elevators.”
The panic was checked, but as the
three drew near the entrance those
who were in front came running back,
shrieking. The cause of the new alarm
was manifest. A roaring sheet of
Hamo shot up each elevator. The top
lloor of hotel below was blazing.
Caught in the terror-stricken crowd,
Rita looked at Jim in dread. She was
being crushed by the seething throng
that surged back from the elevators
toward tho parapet. But the next
moment she felt herself lifted in a
pair of strong arms and carried
through the mob.
“There is no danger!" she heard
John Campbell whisper in her ear.
A minute later lie hud set her down
iu a niche in the parapet, while he
himself and Jim stood guard in front
of her. Around them surged the wild,
uncontrollable crowd of pleasure-mak
ers, but she rested securely.
"I don't know how we can thank you
enough,” said Jim to John Campbell,
"I hope this is the beginning of a
friendship that will last. ’
"I hope so," answered John,
Somehow they seemed waiting for
her to speak. But as she did not, Jim
blurted out;
"I don't know whether our friend
knows it, Rita, but I ought to tell you
that Miss Ida Campbell and f —”
"I know it very well,” said John,
smiling.
“Jim!” exclaimed Rita. “You don’t
mean that — ’
“Will you be very angry with me,
Rita?” asked Jim.
"Why, it's wonderful!” cried Rita,
catching at her breath. “Jim, you dear
old boy, 1 am so glad. It is just like
a romance.”
"1 was afraid —’’ stammered Jim. "I
mean, after our always lyiving meant
so much to each other —”
Perhaps circumstances alter cases.

MONGOOSE IS A PEST
WEST INDIES SEEKING PLAN TO
GET RID OF IT.
Government Rewards Have Only Had
the Effect of Adding to Their
Number, and the Problem Has
Become Serious.
"The mongoose pest la becoming
really serious; it is worse than ever,’
writes a Trinidad correspondent to a
British paper.
Formerly, he says, the government
gave a substantial reward for each
body or tall produced, but no sub
stantial reduction resulted. Some en
terprising peasants were suspected ot
making a successful minor Industry
by breeding the mongoose, and in one
ward it was established that an inno
cent warden bad paid for the same
tails over and over again. As soon
as bought they were burled, only to
be dug up and sold again in the morn*
ing.
Another amusing, if expensive, thing
occurred in this connection. In two ad
joining wards an experiment was
tried. At one they gave a flat rate —
75 cents each —male or female. At
another the price was $1 for the fe
male and 50 cents for the male.
After some time it dawned on the
official purchasers that there was a
groat preponderance of females in the
latter ward. The simple peasant had
again proved one too many for the au
thorities. Inquiry proved that all the
females caught in both wards wore
sold in the one where the price was
raised, and all the males vice versa.
Then the government got tired of it,
and no further reward was given.
The mongoose, it may bo recalled,
was imported into the West Indies in
the seventies of last century, to ex
terminate the rats which ravaged the
cane fields. They did this most ef
fectually, but, having destroyed the
rats, they turned their attention to
poultry and birds. Then lizards fell
a prey to their voracious appetites,
with the result that the insects in
creased in an alarming extent. Final
ly the mongoose became as great a
post there as rabbits are in Australia.
National Debt of France.
The national debt of France listed
before the outbreak of war was $6,-
430,121bbi11. (American Whitaker, 1915,
latest figures available, 1913). Assum
ing that subscriptions to the French
loan of victory reach a total of $4,000,-
000,000. the total debt of France at the
present time would, according to the
best estimate available at the mo
ment. be in the neighborhood of $16,-
800,000,000. fly the listing before the
war, which is chiefly for the fiscal
year ended in October, 1913, the larg
est national debt was that of Franco,
with Russia second, the United King
dom third, Italy fourth, and Spain
fifth. From the outbreak of war until
October of this year Germany had
been the largest borrower, Great Brit
ain the second, Russia third, France
fourth, and Austria fifth. Germany's
debt has Increased by more than 500
per cent, Great Britain's by about 160
per cent, Russia's by about 50 per
cent, while that of France has in
creased by less than one-third. This
does not, however, include the “loan
ot victory.”
Kipling No Lover of Cats.
Rudyard Kipling, says the l>ondon
Chronicle, is evidently no lover ot
cats, for the tale of "The Cat Who
Walked by Himself" is based on the
latest hostility between the cat and
the man. He describes how the dog,
the horse and the cat in turn are at
tracted to the cave of our ancestors
and become domesticated, but the cat
still retains his freedom. Even though
he has fallen a victim to the seduc
tions of the fireside, and agreed to ac
cept the terms imposed by the man
and the dog, he never becomes really
friendly.
You remember the lines: "He will
kill mice and he will be kind to babies
when he is in the house. Just as long
as they don't pull his tail too hard.
But . . . when night comes he is the
cat that walks by himself, and all
places are alike to him. Then he goes
out to the wet, wild woods, up the
wet, wild trees, or on the wet, wild
roofs waving his wild tail and walking
by his wild love. ’
Different Fish Story
J. Clarence Harvey, the Lambs’ club
wit, is telling this story about elimi
nation: The proprietor of a fish store
had a new sign. "Fresh Fish for Sale
Here.” "Why say ‘here’?" said the
first customer. "It’s unnecesary." He
painted "here” out. Said the second
customer, “Why ‘for sale?’ Of course
they’re for sale.” He painted out two
words more. “Why ‘fresh?’” said a
third customer. "You wouldn’t sell
them It they weren’t fresh, would
you?” At last the sign read just
“Fish.” Along cams a fourth cus

The Germ Peril.

knowledge has made the average per

“How so?"

SAILING TO WIN
“What was the matter with you fel
lows in the race?” asked the man at
the clubhouse who made it his busi
ness to hold down the big armchair
reserved for the rocking-chair fleet.
The young man who had just jerked
a big dinghy out of the water and
landed it nigh up on the dock dropped
wearily into the bow seat and looked
at the speaker.
“Say, this yachting business isn't
what its cracked up to be, especially
when you take everyone s advice," ho
declared, bitterly. “When 1 bought
the Nancy all the wise fellows dropped
around one at a time and in bunches
and suggested that I'd better get Dud
ley to sail my boat for me the first
season. They pointed out that 1 was
new to the game and it wouldn't look
well for me to lose all the big silver
cups, especially when I had a fast
boat."
"So you got Dudley to do the stick
work, eh?"
“Well. I admit I was easy. I had
never sailed a big boat before, and I
didn't want to make any bad breaks.
Dudley is a tine sailor. Ha would let
me come down and get everything
ready for him —Ji.st so many reefs in
the mainsail, all the big kites put
in stops, so they would break out at
the right time —and when he came
aboard all he had to do was to make
suggestions and kicks.
“Today we were to sail for the John
son cup. It's a beauty and 1 wanted
to take it out to Austin and show it to
my landlubber friends. So 1 got Dud
ley to sail Hie boat for me. It was
blowing pretty hard and wo had in
two reefs and the staysail. The way
wo tore down the harbor toward the
line made me wish 1 was ashore, so
1 could telephone to my friends that
the cup was a cinch for my yacht.
Before the starting gun was fired we
nearly ran clear through another yacht
that was jockeying near the line. 1
didn't like the way the boat was being
sailed, but thought it was because I
didn't understand the fine points of
the game. 1 thought that perhaps the
stunt was to disable as many of the
boats in our class as possible—then it
would be easier for us to win. It
looked that way, for we luffed into an
other yacht and nearly lost our own
bowsprit. When wo crossed the line
1 could almost see that cup sitting on
my dresser, for we were first and we
kept first—in fact, we went so fast that
the other yachts seemed to bo ai>
chored.’’
"So you won the race?"
“Won nothing! When we got out to
the four-mile crib, which was the first
buoy wo were to round, we passed it to
port and went sailing north. Then we
looked back to give the other fellows
the happy smile, and what do you
think! Every blamed boat went sail
ing gracefully around that crib, pass
ing it to starboard, and was off on the
southern course. We had the balloon
up and ny expert sailor, instead of
giving the boys up forward time to
got it in. as I would have done, luffed.
The next minute I saw myself paying
out $25 for a new sail."
“Caught on the spreader?"
“I should say it did—it ripped from
head to toot. Wo all talked at once.
I insisted that the course was the way
the other boats went and Dudley final
ly admitted that lie didn't really know
what the race was—Just kind of sup
posed that the course was the way we
started to sail It.
“When we got the balloon In and
staysail up the other boats were so
far ahead that 1 said we might as
well go in. What was the use of rac
ing, anyhow, it you couldn’t win? But
I’ll sail my own boat after this.
“Someone wants mo at the tele
phone? Wants to know whether I
won? Say, steward, just tell her
there wasn't any race —that the lake
was too rough.’’

In order to communicate with the
people on Mars, the scientists tell us,
all we have to do Is to construct a
series of ten min ors, each 40 miles In
diameter, and flash signals to the
planet with rays of light. Then we
may wait a couple of million years
while the people of Mara, providing
they are people and not pollywogs, fig
ure out what we are driving at and
then devise away to answer us. The
answer, when it does come, probably
will be for us to mind our own busi
