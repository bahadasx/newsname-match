Army Bills—Confers With Leaders.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9. — With
President Wilson urging both demo
cratic and republican members of the
house military committee to hasten
preparation of bills to carry out the
army's part in the national prepared
ness scheme, indications tonight were I
that the measures might be ready for '
tlie house within two weeks.
Hearings will come to a close to
morrow or next day and it is under
stood the main features of the bills
already have been whipped into shape
in which they will receive virtually
the unanimous approval of the com
mittee.
Tlie senate committee already has
concluded its hearings on army bills
and'wiir'take upThTwork of drafting I
its proposals for the senate early next '
week
The bills of the two houses, it is ex
pected. will differ radically and the
final legislation will be worked out as
a compromise in conference.
Progress was made today on navy
legislation, the measures paving the
way for construction of battleships
43 and 44 at navy yards and provid
ing for 300 additional midshipmen in
the July class at Annapolis, being
passed by the senate. They passed
the house today and now lack only
the president's signature to become
law. Speaker Clark, in line with his
recent speech In the house advocating
that, the personnel at both Annapolis
and West Point be doubled, introduced
a bill today to make such an increase
in the number of cadets at the mili
Chairman Hay of the house military
committee, and several of his demo
cratic colleagues, discussed army plans
with President Wilson during the day
at the president's suggestion. Tomor
row Representative Kahn, ranking re
publican member, and others of the
minority will go to the White House
on the same t 'rand.
it was evident in later proceedings
of the committee that Representative
Hay had not been swayed from his op
position to Secretary Garrison's pro
nosal for a continental army, which
the president advocated during his
recent preparedness campaign trip to

Democrats and republicans of the
committee agreed tonight in saying
that an army bill would be written
quickly, although there might be
minor details which would take con
siderable debate to settle. The fea
ture of tlie house bill, it was said,
will be- federalization of the national
guard through a pay hill carrying limi
tations designed to give the war de
partment peace time conrtol of train
ing and officering of the national
guard.
Adjutant General Foster of tlie Flor
ida guard, chairman of the executive
committee of the National Guard asso
ciation. again was in Washington to
night and it was understood lie would
lie further consulted in order that the
Dill might be made acceptable to tlie
state troops.
Coupled with the pay feature of the
bill probably will be Chairman Hay's
plan to authorize the president to
draft national guardsmen into tlie fed
eral service immediately in time of
war. This is designed to settle any
conflict of authority which might
arise and also to insure the whole
membership of the guard will be
available for federal uses, the num
ber not being dependent as now upon
how many volunteers.
For the regular army the bill prob
ably will provide tlie 40,000 additional
men asked for by Secretary Garrison,

Mrs. Bennie Christensen, who on

Lehigh, now occupies a cell at the
county jail, having been brought in by

Mrs. Kirkpatrick is in the hospital at

ohan , ce of recovering Mrs. Christen
f en IK a wc " educated young woman,
Du ^ as 8-PP®arance, she is badly
handicapped just now by a pair of
badly blackened eves and a scratch or
two. The real cause of the trouble
at Lehigh is supposed to have been the
attentions paid Mrs. Kirkpatrick, who
was a waitress at the hotel, by Mr.
Christensen. There had been more
or less trouble between Mr. and Mrs.
Christensen for some time.
It was stated yesterday by a party
from Lehigh, who was at the hotel
for some time prior to the shooting,
that on Monday Mrs. Christenson had
decided to leave the place. Her trunk
was packed and everything in readi
ness when she met Mrs. Kirkpatrick
in the hallway and asked her o ques
tion that had no bearing whatever
upon the difficulty. Immediately Mrs.
Kirkpatrick rushed aL her and lilt her
a blow in the eye that knocked her
Hat. That happened immediately In
front of Mrs. Christensen's room, and
she hacked inside and secured the
pistol and as she came out and there
were still indications of hostility, com
menced firing.
These facts, if they prove to be tlie
facts, put a very different face upon
Ihe matter from that originally stated.

does not seem to have played any

Fot some time past he had acted
queer at times, and doubtless while in
an irrational state of mirnl the act
was committed.
Mrs. Hopkins was at home with her
husband just before the shooting oc
curred, which took place at !>: BO
lock. Jim, as he was familiarly
j known by his many friends, went
ihe coal shed to get a bucket of coal.
Mrs. Hopkins was upstairs, when sin;
heard a pistol report. Having no sus
plcion of what Imd happened, she
went down stairs a little later and
then went to the coal shed, where she
found Jim lying prostrate, a 38-calibre
pistol at his leet and an ugly wound
through his hood. She immediately sum
moned a physician, I)r. Biddle being
i plied and quickly dressing the wound.
while the officers were also notified
at once. Th" wounded man was re
moved to tin hospital, where he ex
pired at 4 p. in. without regaining
consciousness. When found by Mrs.
Hopkins, lie was unconscious.
The bullet entered at the right tem
ple and emerged just hack of the left
ear, piercing ihe brain and was neces
sarily of a fatal character. Because
of Ills wonderful vitality and physique,
tlie man was able to live for as many
hours ns he rlid.

THERE ARE NO STOCK LOSSES
IN THE JUDITH BASIN.
MR. EARLING WANTS INFORMATION
In response to an inquiry from
President A. J. Furling of the Chi
cago, Milwaukee Ai St Paul Railway
Co., regarding entile conditions in the
territory tributary to that system in
this part of Montana, David Hllger,
president of the First National bank,
Thursday sent a wire, stating that
stock was wintering well and that
there hud been practically no losses,
despite the severe weather.
Mr. liilger wired that there wus
ample feed, and that not withstanding'
the cold weather, and the further fact |
that much new slock Imd been shipped!
in from the central states, late in the;
summer, there had been no losses to;
speak of to date, and lie anticipated l
none, even if the cold snap continued I
for some time yet.
I Jtisl now it seems as though tliei
j cold spell is broken. The reason fori
| the excellent condition of the stock
! is that the cattle went into the winter
( In the best of shape, owing to the
good grass season the past year, and
most important of all, that cattle are
now scattered in small bunches among
many farmers all over the county, -
so that better care Is given than In
the days of the range. Tlie farmers
have feed, sheds and stables to keen
their stock in, and to care for it prop
erly.
A number of reports of losses
among newly shipped in stuff hive
been run down and found to lie
groundless. Of course, a head will
die here and there hut that is only
an average condition, to he expected
year after year.
Mr. liilger says that even if hay
should run low. there is an abundance
of straw, grain and other feed to tie
had in the county, while hay is plen

can buy from someone who has
