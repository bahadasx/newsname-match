SHORT HORNHBID
SHORTHORN CATTLE DEPART­
MENT AT MID-WINTER FAIR IS
ONE OF THE GREATEST AT­
TRACTIONS LENTON GETS
PICK OF THE HERD.
Frank Lenton of Norwich bought
of P. W. Miller, president of the Mi­
not Auto Co., his $1000.00 herd animal
and twenty head of heifers at the Mid­
winter Fair Tuesday. This is one of
the largest sales of full-blooded cat­
tle that is on record in the Northwest.
Mr. Lenton can be proud of being able
to purchase this wonderful herd of
cattle, as it is without question sec­
ond to none in the Northwest. This
herd animal was with his mother at
the International Show at Chicago in
1914, when she took first prize in the
roan beef type Shorthorn class.
There is an unusual interest being
taken in the Cattle Department at the
Fair and it demonstrates to us that the
framers in this territory are becoming
more inerested in cattle, even in the
face of the prevailing high price of
wheat. With this interest manifest in
it is, there is no question but that this
country is going to develop into a
farming basis that will equal or exceed
the Eastern States, as they are not
waiting until wheat is a total failure
before making a start. Mr. Miller, of
the Minot Auto Co., is to be congratu­
lated upon offering cattle of such high
quality for sale.

N. D., who was put out of all events
as the result of the double defeat.
Sheppard had an easy time with
Mrs. Kermott in the consolation, beat­
ing her, 12 to 4. In the all comers,
however, she had the assistance of Dr.
R. White of St. Paul, who replaced one
of her players who was compelled to
leave for home. Sheppard gained a
big lead, but the feminine skip crept
up steadily toward the close, and was
lying when she shot her last rock.
She tried to guard but fell short, and
Sheppard took out the counter and
laid one himself, winning the game.
Dr. Williamson had a hard battle
with Pence of Minot in the all comers.
The Minot skip tied the score in the
twelfth end and when Dr. Williamson
reached his last rock in the thirteenth,
he had to draw through an exceed­
ingly narrow porte in order to lay
shot. He succeeded, rubbing a guard
and slipping through almost to the
button.
Goodman also had to play thirteen
ends in order to defeat Dr. McCannel
of Minot. With his final rock he had
to draw in the winning 9hot and he
did so by a margin of not more than
an inch.

Martin Aakrann has returned fro/n
Glenwod, Minn., where he attended a
big Skiing tournament Friday and
Saturday. Seventy ski jumpers from
all parts of the country contested for
the large number of premiums that
had been hung up. The best jump
made was 136 feet, which was fair,
considering that the record is 165
feet.
Henriesen, who turns a complete
soiqersault on skis, clearing 134 feet,
was there and gave an exhibiton. "Bar­
ley Riley, the little sawed-off Irish­

part in the events. It will be remem­

great excitement produced for either
side, altho at the end of the first half
the score stood 18 to 4 in favor of
Donnybrook.
"fc the second half the Normal boys
earui back with some spirit. Limbaugh
was-put to guard, Christianson shift­
ed to center, and Sanford called to
forward. He played a good game at
forward, making five out of the ten
field goals. Limbaugh's guarding was
also good.
The good work of the Donnybrook
team was largely that of Murphy, M.
King and R. King, "altho the guarding
of Alberts and Peterson had merit.

After the game the Donnybrook

the visitors heartily appreciated and
which helps to make defeat lose its
sting.
On Thursday afternoon the Girls
Glee Club sang two numbers at the
Mid-winter Fair, "Stars Brightly
Shining," by Bronti. and "Come,

The Boys' Glee Club gave two selec­

"Southern Dances." This is the first
appearance of the Boys' Glee Club so
it is attended with special interest.
On Saturday evening, Feb. 5, the
Faculty Club was entertained by Miss
McCulloch, Miss Cook and Mrs. Mc
Arthur in the social rooms of the Main
building. It was a postponed appoint­
ment, the severe weather on the regu­

ble. The members were entertained
with a varied program, most clever
and enjoyable in every detail.
Mr. Altmann has made a translation
from the German of an article which
will appear in the March "Mind and
Body."
In this article the author, Dr. Du
Bois Reymond, disproves the belief
that the benefits from apparatus ex­
ercises depend wholly upon the oxy­
gen consumption during the exercises.
Instead, he holds that in apparatus
work the oxygen consumption is com­
paratively low in proportion to the
hygenic value of such exercises.
The basket ball tournament of the

lad eighteen years of age, who lives on
a farm near Minot, were placed under
