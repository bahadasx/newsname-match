STRIKE OF NEEDLE WORKERS
" i IN NEW YORK CITY.
Approximately 40,000 Out No Disor
ders the First Day.
NeW York, Feb. 9. The first day of
the strike of approximately 40,000
needle workers for increased pay and
better 1 working conditions passed
Without disorder. A small army-? of
police was on -duty to meet-any emer
gencies which might arise, but only
three arrests were made. These girls
were taken into custody for obstruct
ing traffic by their distribution of cir
culars urging support of the walkout.
Their fines of $5 each were paid.
All the afternoon and early evening
were devoted to registration. When
the girls went to the halls and meeting
places to which they were ordered to
register their names they received in
structions as to their conduct if they
are assigned to picket duty. A deter
mined effort probably will be made to
morrow morning to induce the girls
who have not already ceased work to
Join the strike. A large percentage of
those who have struck are not yet
members of the International Ladies'
Garment Workers' union, and the first
duty of the leaders will be to supply
them with union cards.1
A score of meetings of strikers was
held tonight in halls throughout the
city. - In almost every instance the
meeting places were packed to ca
pacity and many girls were unable to
obtain admission.
Abraham BarofT, secretary and
treasurer of the international union,
declared tonight 4.he workers are de
termined to remain on strike, until
their employers have made agreements
with the unions involved. Because of
the great rush: of work in all shops,
he sa$3, he expected an early victory.
Members of the Manufacturers' as
sociation already have reached an
agreement with their employes and
these girls are merely taking a "vaca
tion" at their own expense, to show
their sympathy for the workers in in
dependent shops whose employers do
not belong to the association.
At a Meeting tonight of the Jewelry
Workers' union, 2,500 of the members
of which also are on strike, it was
announced that arrangements had
been made for picketing shops
throughout the city.

WHOLESALE INACCURACIES
IN EXPORT STATISTICS
Admitted by Secretary Redfield of the
Department of Commerce.
Washington, Feb. 9. Wholesale in
accuracies in government export sta
tistics were admitted today by Secre
tary Redfield of the department of
commerce, in a speech before the
Chamber -of Commerce of the United
States. He said, however, that by an
order Issued Feb. 1st- he had remedied
the situation so far as was in his
power and that the gross errors of the
past, caused by refusal of shippers to
give the government facts and by an
tiquated laws, would not be repeated.
The secretary referred to a charge
made a month ago by officials of the
chamber that the percentage of error
in departmental reports was so great
it was impossible even for exporters to
estimate it; that single cargoes run
ning into thousands of dollars in value
left American ports without being re
corded and that the published export
figures for 1914 fell far.rshort of the
actual exports. r .
He said there was only slight inac
curacy in import statistics, as returns
on imports were more fully under gqv
ernment control.
"Such errors as have existed in re
cording exports," said he, "are proper
ly understated. The business of com
piling figures of 5,000,000,000 a year
under a law of 1820 is not a simple
matter. The errors have been caused
wholly by shippers who were unwilling
to state the facts. I am glad that you
have gone into this matter. You are
my witnesses that there are no closed
doors in the department of commerce.
So long as I have anything to do with
that department, if there is anything
of concealment I will show it up."
Others who addressed the chamber
Included Dr. Wellington Koo, the Chi
nese minister, - who declared that in
China the greatest of world markets
awaited the American business man;
Senator Fletcher of Florida, and Ed
ward A. Filene of Boston, whose 'sub
ject was "A Business View of the
Peace to Come."
Approval was voted of a recom
mendation that the .federal govern
ment keep friendly with the states
trading at a maximum expenditure of
$720,000 a year.

TEIPER WILL BE
: TRIED BEFORE JURY
For the Murder of His Mother In
dictment Returned by Grand Jury.
Buffalo, N. Y., Feb. 9. John Edward
Teiper will be tried before a Jury at
the April term of the supreme court
for the alleged murder of his mother,
Mrs. Agnes M. Teiper. Both prosecu
tion and defense agreed after the re
turn of an indictment by the grand
jury today, charging Teiper with ma
tricide, to which he pleaded not guilty,
that it was desirable to await the pos
sible recovery of Grace J. Teiper, the
only other surviving eyewitness of the
Orchard Park tragedy.
The hope that the young woman ul
timately will recover grew stronger
today among the physicians attending
her. Her periods of returning con
sciousness were longer and she ap
peared to be gaining strength hourly.
It was said, however, that with one ex
ception she had said nothing that
could be construed as a reference to
the murders. The nature of her single
utterance about the crime has not been
disclosed.

CONTROVERSY BETWEEN
RAILROADS AND EMPLOYES
First Statement Was Issued by Train
men Last Night.
Cleveland. Ohio, Feb. 9. The first
official statement on the impending
controversy between railroads of the
country and their train crews over
working hours was issued here to
night. It was signed by W. S. Stone,
grand chief engineer of the Brother
hood of Locomotive Engineers; W. S.
Carter, president of the Brotherhood
of Locomotive Firemen and Engine
men: L. E. Sheppard, acting president
of the Order of Railway Conductors
and W. G. Lee, president of the
Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen.
These organizations claim to repre
sent approximately 400,000 employes
on 52-S lines.
The statement was headed "Why
the eight hour day?" and was a reply
to a statement Issued February 1st by
the executive committee of the Asso
ciation of Western Railways. The
statement said in part:
"The eight-hour day movement is
based wholly upon the justice of a
work day of reasonable hours that
will permit the men further to sepa
rate the dead line between work and
wages. The railroads say - in effect
that men who have put In a few
years of railroad service have worked
themselves out and will not be ac
cepted if they lose their positions! If
men are worked out in a few years
under present service conditions, the
demand to extend their wage earning
years is fully Justified.
"Overtime in road service Is due al
most wholly to the practice of rail
roads overloading trains so that they
cannot make their mileage within
their -time limits. ' The railroads are
doing- this for profit; they do not de
ny it and if they propose to demand
extra service at the sacrifice of the
health and future earning ability of
the men they should pay extra for
it." . - -.- - .- -
