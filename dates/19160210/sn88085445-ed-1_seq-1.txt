IP I have correctly interpreted pan-Americanism from the standpoint
of the relations of our government with those beyond the seas it is
in entire harmony with the Monroe doctrine. The Monroe doctrine
is a national policy of the United States; pan-Americanism is an interna
tional policy of the Americas. The motives are to an extent different;
the ends sought are the same. Both can exist without impairing the
force of either. And both do exist and, I trust, will ever exist in all
their vigor.
BUT PAN-AMERICANISM EXTENDS BEYOND THE SPHERE OF
POLITICS AND FINDS ITS APPLICATION IN THE VARIED FIELDS OF
HUMAN ENTERPRISE. BEARING IN MIND THAT THE ESSENTIAL
IDEA MANIFESTS ITSELF IN CO-OPERATION, IT BECOMES NECES
SARY FOR EFFECTIVE CO-OPERATION THAT WE SHOULD KNOW
EACH OTHER BETTER THAN WE DO NOW. WE MUST NOT ONLY BE
NEIGHBORS, BUT FRIENDSi NOT ONLY FRIENDS, BUT INTIMATES
WE MUST UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER. WE MUST COMPREHEND
OUR SEVERAL NEEDS. WE MUST STUDY THE PHASES OF MATERIAL
AND INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTS WHICH ENTER INTO THE
VARIED PROBLEMS OF NATIONAL PROGRESS. WE SHOULD, THERE
FORE, WHEN OPPORTUNITY OFFERS, COME TOGETHER AND FA
MILIARIZE OURSELVES WITH EACH OTHER'S PROCESSES OF
THOUGHT IN DEALING WITH LEGAL, ECONOMIC AND EDUCATIONAL
QUESTIONS.
Commerce and industry, science and art, public and private law, gov
ernment and education, all those great fields which invite the intellectual
thought of man, fall within the province of the deliberations of thia con
gress. In the exchange of ideas and comparison of experiences we will
come to know one another and to carry to the nations which we represent
a better and truer knowledge of our neighbors than we have had in the
past I believe that from that wider knowledge a mutual esteem and
trust will spring which will unite these republics more closely politically,
commercially and intellectually and will give to the pan-American spirit
an impulse and power which it has never known before.

THINGS THAT NEVER DIE.
The pure, the bright, the beau
tiful
That stirred our hearts Is
youth,
The Impulses to wordless prayer.
The streams of love and truth;
The longing after something
lost.
The spirit's yearning' cry.
The striving after better hopes—
These things can never die.
The timid hand stretched forth
to aid
A brother in his need;
A kindly word In griefs dark
hour
That proves a friend indeed;
The plea for mercy softly
breathed.
When Justice threatens high,
The sorrow of a contrite heart—
These things shall never die-
Let nothing pass, for every band
Must find some work to do;
Lose not a chance to waken
love-
Be firm and Just and true;
So shall a light that cannot fade
Beam on thee from on high.
And angel voices say to thee—
"These things shall never die"
—Charles Dickens.
NEEDN'T REGISTER
NOW IN TOWNSHIPS
Registration for township and
school elections is not necessary, ac
cording to an opinion by Prosecut
ing Attorney W. P. Brown issued
this week. All registration ottl*
elals were notified of the decision.
Primary elections will be held
Tuesday in Lynden townshir, f*nd
Wednesday in Delta township and
all voters in the district will be sn
titlcd to cast a ballot.
Mr. Brown based his opinion on
one from the attorney-general, and
explains hi 3 stand in the following
letter to the county auditor:
To County Auditor Will Wallace:
On Jan. 27, in response to your
request, I asked the attorney gener
al for an opinion as to whether or
not under Chap. 16, Laws of 1915.
it was necessary for prospective
voters at school elections and town
ship elections to register prior to
such elections.
On Feb. I, I received a rep'.y
from the attorney general in which
ne enclosed a copy of an opinion to
the prosecuting attorney Of Yak
>ma County, in which he holds it M
not necessary to register for school
elections. While he did not ex
pressly rcpiy to my query relating
10 townships, be does state in his
opinion that Chap. 16 only sought
to amend the general election laws
and no other laws, and states in his
ietter transmitting the opinion that
ihe opinion covers the points
inquired about by the letter above
referred to.
You are therefore advised that
relying upon the opinion of ihe at
;ornej-general, it is not necessary
that voters at township or school
elections be registered voters.
