BASKET BALL BOYS
LOSE THREE GAMES
Tho hoys gnmc of ImHkct ball at
Las Vegas was started with n rush.
For fivo mlnutCH neither Hide scored,
then Tucurncari threw the flrHt bns
kct. Thin seemed to quiet tho crowd
who were figuring on n wnlk-nwny for
their team.
Then Vegas began to score nnd at
the end of the first ten minutes the
acorn stood 7 to 4 in favor of Vegas.
The long court began to tell on tho
Tucurncari boys anil Vegas opened up
carrying tho ball from one end to
tho other with apparent case.
As the gamo was more or less a
free-for-all Gentry was found guilty
of holding and forced to piny slower.
ThU gavo his forward a chanco to
cage many goals. Fouling wns fre
quent througiiout the game, but nei
ther referee, nor umpire, would call
them unless the foul wns plainly seen
by tho spectators. The crowd want
ed rough ilay and hissed nnd hooted
when fouls were cnllcd.
Tho first half ended with Las Vegas
having a big lead. Tho Tucurncari
lads were tired nnd showed it. The
second half opened with Tucurncari
again scoring first but tho spurt was
only temporary. Gentry wns disqual
ified for personal fouls and Gcrhardt
went in at guard. He would not stay
with his man and Ilite threw many
goals. Tho game ended with Las Ve
gas leading fid to Hi. Ilnyden nnd
Hito starred for Las Vegas and Jack
son for Tucurncari. Haydcn a guard,
threw six field goals. Hito scored 30
points or more than linlf made. Jack
son played an all-around good game.
Friday night the boys met Raton.
They hod practically the same line
up ns at Vegas. This game was the
best of the three although Tucurncari
lost. Prof. Keclie of Trinidnd wns tho
referee and held the boys down. Fight
ing over the bnll after tho whistle was
blown, was called a personal foul, nnd
tho boys soon know he was master of
the game. Thoy were well satisfied
with all his decisions.
Tho game opened with n fast start
tho ball going from goal to gonl with
out cither sido scoring for ton mln
utes. Tho crowd wns yelling all tho
timo begging Raton to hcore. When
at last they did the crowd nearly rals
d the roof. Tho Raton center was
put out on fouls in the first fifteen
minutes. The referee was strict and
in the second half Gentry ngain wns
disqualified. Dixon went in ut for
ward and Gcrhardt at Guard. Dixon
.scored better than Whnrton but Gcr
hardt did not stay with his forward.
Tho last half seemed long as tho
boys were nearly worn out. Raton
won by a scoro of f7 to 10. Jnckson
Jacobs and Fnusnacht played best for
Tucurncari and Fred Gillispic for Ra
ton.
Tho floor hnd a post in the center
and a radiator at each end of the
court. Tho ceiling was low and over
hand shots were out of the question.
Tho boys were tired after the game.
Wharton who was unable to piny tho
second half and Dixon who replaced
him wcro sick all night. Gentry nnd
Gcrhardt who took his place, were
all in nnd even big Jacobs wns com
plaining. Jnckson and Fausnacht
played hard the full gamo although
both woro effected by tho altitude.
Tho Tucurncari boys woro faithful
rooters for the visiting LnJunta girls'
team. LaJunta defenting Raton girls
asily. LaJunta played slow but each
pass seemed to go just where it wns
desired. Only one girl used the single
hand throw and she played the ball
from one end to the other.
LaJunta was champion of Colorndo
last year and arc on the road to a
second championship. Tho forwards
were suro and played together.
The next day wns used in preparing
for Trinidad. Trinidad played in an
amusement hall with a very slick
floor. Tho court was 80 feet long or
about 32 feet longer than the Tucum
carl floor. When tho bnll went from
one end to the other tho boys thought
thoy wcro going on a cross-country
raco. The long court played havoc
with teamwork except Trinidnd who
wns used to tho floor. Timo nnd again
Fausnacht dribbled from end ncitrly
to the goal only to loso it ugain he
fore he could shoot for thtj basket
Jackson and f nusnncht would pass
back una forth and ngain lost by hnv
lug the puss intercepted when it seem
cd like nothing could stop them. Only
the length of the court enabled Trin
idnd to beat them.
Our boys had poor luck in making
free throws. After Whnrton went out
only two free throws woro nmdo. If
the boys could have mndo free throws
tho scoro would have been much clos
nr.
Tho LnJunta girls played nt Trin
dnd and won 30 to 20.
Trinidad hnd a faithful bunch of
rooters and kept cheering throughout
tho entire game.
It was a long hard trip for tho boys
und they could not bo expeeted to win
niter the strain of riding ana now
courts and much higher altitude. In
all games tho first fifteen minutes
were tho best with tho score close
.After that tho trip and altitudo began
to tell and tho boyB grow weak and
could not keep up their usual fast
work. Hero thoy can withstand tho
fastest pace and hnvo always give
their opponents ns much as thoy re
ceive.
Numerous pictures woro taken and
the trip will be long romcmbcrcd hj'
those who went. Tucumrarl had the
following representation: Jackson.
Wharton, Fuusnacht, Gentry, Jacobs,
Gcrhardt, Dixon, Shnff, Referee Phil
lips and Prof. Ellis.
Tho Nows received nn excellent nr
tlclo fully ooverlng tho trip of the
girls' basket bnll team, but too lato to
give in thU week's Issue. Wo might
snv that tho girls only played one
game and woro defeated in thnt 18
to . Next week wo will give tho ar
ticle ns written.
RELIEVES SUCH CONFLICT
WILL NEVER COME AGAIN
St. Louis. Mo.. Fob. .1 President
Wilson, today told an audience of 16
000 cheering tumultously at his feet,
that the United States should have
thn iri'iitost navv in tho world.
I bollcvo tho navy or tno umicu
O- . , . . I
Sfntna uhnulil bo unconfluorable," he
said, "tho greatest in tho world."
The president declared that sub
mnrino commanders nbroad have In
structions which for tho most part
conform with international law, but
that the net of one commander might
sot the world afire, including Amer
ica. ...
"Upon the ocean thcro are hundreds
cargoes of American goods," he
said. "Cotton, grnin nnd all the boun
teous supplies America is sending out
to the world nnd any of those car
goes, any one of those ships, may be
the point of contact that win wing
Amerlcu Into tho war."
For tho first time during tho tour,
the president told of how one set of
belllKercnts was cut off from tho oth
er nations of tho world. He said this
kept the United States from helping
them, ns it would likely cause troumo.
Ho mndu the statement in trying to
show thnt tho United States wns "real-
y neutral."
There was an overflow of 30,000
persons on the outsido while tho pres
ident spoke in the coliseum.
Ho also spoko nt n breakfast of the
St. Louis Ruslnc88 Men's League bo-
fore going to tho Coliseum for his
mnin nddrcss.
"There arc many things I would like
to speak of, but now I urn talking of
nationnl defense," said Mr. Wilson.
"Not only is it necessary to mobil
ize forces of the nation but also the
economic forces of the nation.
I am not looking forward to war,
but to times of peace. Peoples do not
into each other, and therefore, thcyjWCKry stCps, nnd buoy our discour-
will do business again together.
"America has been shy at going out
into competition with the rest of tho
world," he said. I nm ready to
match tho business of America against
that of the rest of tho world.
Ho cxnlnlncd thnt the United States
must keep out of wnr If posslblo in
order to help In the "healing process
es." Tho president declared that such a
wnr enn never como again : nnd that
tho wnr will nut forward the time of
universal peace better thnn anything
else could.
The president opened with the state
ment that he had "como seeking some
thing In the middle west and found
t." Ho said he had been Wia ine mid
dle west was ug&lnst preparedness
but did not believe it.
"I did not come out to learn now
you thought but to toll you what wns

'Amerlcu is nt nenco with nil the

Wo nro tho friond of nil tho world
becnuso we aro made up of all tho
world, nnd understand all tho world.
It wou Id tear the heartstrings or
America to bo at war with nny pthor
nntion.
"Wo bclievo we can show our friend
shin for the world better by keeping
out of this strugglo than by getting
into it. I do not misread tho spirit or
America.
"I have no Indictment of any form
of government.
"No mun can lead Amorica whither
her people do not desire to be led. So
far as America Is concerned, no man
nnnil tm nmnni'Ht u h nrttimmna neaco.
Wo are disciples of peace already.
nnd no man need preach that gospel
to us."

ORGANIZE
BUSINESS
MEN'S ASSOCIATION
The huninosH men hnvo orgnnlzca
n Business Men's Association nnd nl-
rcady a largo number havo joined it
ns it will bo UHcd for their protection
us well as used to boost everything
that will como up which looks good
for tho town and community. A sub-
organization In tho way of a Chamber
of Commerce will nlso lie perfected
Inter as soon aa tho organization gets
in workinir order.
Evory property owner in tho city
and county should belong to somo kind
of an organization to boost the pro
cresslvo spirit. No town can go for
ward if a majority of tho citizens pull
back instead of push. The merchants
cannot afford to finance everything
Tucurncari needs. They arc not get
tinir rich selling their wares. Mnny
times tho rich men of tho cities are
more benefited by the establishing of
now industries thnn tho merchant, cs
HUH MilVI W '"'"r
pccjaiy wncn competition Is so strong
ns it is in Tucurncari in some lines of
business. Tucumcnri is well adver
tised in the east and highly spoken of
by most people who have visited our
little city and fully enjoyed the won
derful climate and other conveniences.
Tucurncari needs more residences of
a modern type. As soon ns one is va
cated these days it is filled the next
so we believe our city hns by fur more
citizens than ever before. Tho school
buildings nrc full to overflowing nnd
somo of the rooms hnvo more scholars
than can bo comfortably taken euro of
during the nice weather.
There nrc many contemplnted im
provements during the coming sum
mer montha. New capital will bo one
thing necessary to put everything to
going aright. A good strong work
ing commercial organization is the
strongest asset any community can
boast of supporting. It is a pleasure
ns well as n necessity and therefore
Tucurncari should have it.
APPRECIATION
To Friends, Lodges, Organizntions nnd
tho citizens generally of Tucumcnri:
A strcken family bowed low with
grief and anguish offer to you, from
hearts filled with thankfulness, thulr
most grcatful acknowledgment for
for such sympathetic expressions, acts
of kindness, loving attentions, and n
devotion towards the amelioration of
our sorrows, almost beyond human
belief.
Good friends, you hnvc given us
much cheer, helped lift our heads,
mwl uhnwn im :i llrrht to irnliln nut'
ngcu SOUIS.
Let each one individually, as well
as collective bodies, take unto them
selves the knowledge of having done
a great and good work in tho nssis-
tnnce rendered, through which u
wholo family was consoled, nnd n
future goal pointed out that must
forever be n precious thought, und
carry with it a God given rewnrd.
Our loss was a terrible tragedy of
the highest integrity, holding only
good will for nil, loving, devoted sons
nnd brothers, George and Chnrloy
Kohn, passed from us, leaving n her-
itago of honored names, giving us
strength to look forward to a future
made ripor and happier in tho effort
to continue their names, in tho minds
of their friends, and citizens generally.
For tho marvelous demonstration
of good-will you dear people of Tu
curncari bestowed on us, wp gladly
offer to God our most thankful pray:
ers, and for you, offer to Him, our
sincercst prayers to bless, and bestow
His choicest blessing, good health,
upon you.
May ilo give you penco in your
homes, and penco in your hcurts, and
forever make Tucurncari a happy
place to abide in.

TUCUMCAR! MAY
Y. M. 0. A.
A. D. Richardson, of Risbcc, Ariz.,
is hero today looking over the propo
sition of putting in a railroad Y. M.
C. A. He is a special representative
of tho railroad company and will moot
with tho railroad boys tonight at tho
Vorcnberg Hotel.
This is one thing the citizens of
Tucurncari and vicinity need. It fur
nishes a pleasant place to loaf or in
which to spend tho time which would
otherwise be spent in non-desirable
places.
Tho Y. M. C. A. is a good moral
resort where good reading nnd writ
ing materials are nt tho service of
the public. The city should go into
the proposition with the railroad men
und mako it a grand success like Al
buquerque and other wido-nwnkc, pro
gressive towns in this and other states
and tho reward for their services will
bo great.
Where the association is largo nnd
prosperous enough to establish a gym
nasium it will assist in developing
athletes and give tho wenk a place
to gradually become strong through
dnily exercises. The right modo of
exercise is much hotter than medi
cine nnd much more appreciated after
one learns how to take such exercise.
Over indulgence in anything is harm
ful, but most Y. M. C. A. are prop
erly equipped with apparatus and a
secretary that will not allow things
to bo abused cither by members or
visitors, thus everything is regulated
even better than some of our public
schools.
Mr. Richardson thinks there is no
doubt about tho proposition going
through so far as the railroad is con
cerned but the city must show a de
sire to co-operate if the public Is to
bo taken in.
"THE VAGABOND"
On next Sunday night Tucurncari is
to be treated to the first big American
feature film thnt wan ever hund color
ed, entitled "The Beloved Vagabond."
This feature was sept in relays to the
Pathc factory in Franco nnd that deli
cate hand-coloring sometimes seen on
ginglo rcpls runs all the way thrqugh
this wonderful photoplay,
The coloring, nowover, is only un
extra touch of art, and the play itsolf,
by William J. Locke, is tho sweetest
and most beautiful drama ever put
into pictures and is particularly ap
pealing to children nnd grown-ups
alike.
In New York thorc is n publication
issued called "Wid'B." Wid Gunning
s considered the most critical critic
of feature filma of the many who
make a business of reporting these
screen plnys. In his issue of Deccm-
cr 0 he epitomizes as follows on "the
Beloved Vagabond":
Director Edward Jose
As a Whole It will pleaso

He then coes on to say os follows: I
"This Is a splendid offering und the

SECURE
CANNOT GERMANIZE THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE
Washington, Feb. 8. Lieutenant
General Miles, retired, denounced the
continental army before tho house
military committee.
"It would be u very dangerous stop
toward centralization, that would vest
u tremendous power in somo future
president," he sold. "It is un-Amcr-ican.
Why try to Gcrmunizo tho Amor
ienn people? You cunnot Gcrmunizo
citizens."
General Miles pruised tho national
guard, declared compulsory military
service unnecessary, favored three
year enlistments, recommended n rcg
ulur standing army of 140,000 to 150,
000 men und submitted un army re
organization plan of his own, contem
plating recruiting n forco of 1,200,000
men by expanding tho units of organ
ization. He said tho nutional guard
should bo organized tho same way.
He said it would easily be possible to
raise 2,000,000 men, if necessary, in
a reasonably short timo.
General Miles said tho United Suites
was daily manufacturing moro wnr
materials than uny two nations on
enrth ure using in the snmo timo and
that the experience in thu Dardanelles
shows that guns ubonrd ship ure no
match for fortifications und submar
ines. "Over seas expeditions ulways
havo been very expensive and ns a
rule, dlsnstrous. To cross tho Atlantic
or Pacific oceans to land In the U. S.
would be a very serious undertaking."
An enemy, he said, might bo able to
put 400,000 men on its ships, but it
would never be uble to land that num
ber on the United States shores.
STRONG FOR ATHLETICS
Albuquerque, N. M., Feb. 9. Tho
putriotic celebration which alwnys
marks Washington's birthday at the
New Mexico State University, will
take a unique form this 22nd of Feb
ruary. It will be an open air athletic
fete in which the entire University
student body, men and women alike,
will participate. It is nn event which
could only be attempted in New Mex
ico, for it is doubtful if weather con
ditions nnywherc else in tho United
States would permit of Its duplica
tion in nny other state university,
Physicial education is compulsory at
tho state university. It is tho theory
of Ralph F. Hutchinson, director of
physical education, that the only foun
dation fiir vyinning nthletlc teams, is
a soundly and broadly developed stu
dont body. Every student is exam
ined on entrance und the weak points
in physique noted. Thereafter train
ing is cspccinlly adopted to correct
those weak points and to givo tho
student n well rounded constitution,
to the end of "n sound mind In a
sound body."
The effort of Director Hutchinson
is to make this training us interesting
to the student as it is necessary, and
to thnt end his gymnasium exercises,
drills, etc., aro murvdH of intricate
maneuver and stop and turn, all de
signed to keep the student's mind
working right along with his legs,
arms und dhphram. The best of the
drills will be shown in the Washing
ton's Birthday fete. There will be
special drills by classes of women and
classes of men, and drills by men and
women together. A special program
of contests for various classes wiU
round out a program that promises
unusual interest.
