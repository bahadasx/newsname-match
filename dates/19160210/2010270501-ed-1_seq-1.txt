These developments will in all prob

city have had to contend for some
years and It Is hard to predict Just
who will be Implicated and Just bow

Later In the evening the boys had

to keep it separate from any other

A. H. COWLEY
Alliance business men will proba
bly learn something new concerning
the most profitable methods of meet-
ng mall order competition when they
are addressed by A. B. Cowley, -of
Maruette, at tbe business men's and
clerks' banquet to be held Wednesday
night, February 23, In the Phelan
opera house, under the auspices of
the Alliance Commercial Club.
Mr. Cowley, who is manager of the
A. B. Cowley & Company general
store at Marquette, Is said to be one
of the most successful of the Individ
ual antagonists of the mall order
houses In this section of the country
And it is his ideas and his methods,
which have been so successful, that
he Is going to divulge to the Alliance
men at this meeting.
Mr. Cowley fights the mall order
competition with its own weapon.
namely, sdvertising, and this or
course costs money. He publishes a
small paper styled the "A. B. C
Monthly." which probably costs him
more per month than some Alliance
merchants spend In a whole year.
Through this monthly paper be
reaches practically every home In his
trade territory and there Is a certain
personality back of the reading artl
cles and the advertisements contain
ed In Jhe peper that guarantee, that
lt wtll ie read from the- first to the
last line by friend and foe.
He does not berate the mall order
competitor, . neither does he belittle
the man who spends his money away
from home. He goes after the busi
ness on the same basis as the mall
order company does, asking for con
slderatlon only when price, quality
etc.. compare favorably. He endeav
ora to show, and does show, to hi
natrons that he can sell goods just
