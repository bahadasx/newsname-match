ENGINES AND FIREMEN
DAMAGED
Tuesday afternoon two engines on
the Mackay track were derailed in the
vicinity of Moore, and two firemen
were somewhat injured. Mr. Peck of
Blackfoot was one of the unfortunate
firemen, but we understand his injuries
though painful are not serious. The
other injured fireman is a resident of
Pocatello. Another attempt will more
promise of success than the former one
will be made today, and* the agent has
assured some that Mackay would be
reached.
FREE LIBRARY
The ladies of the Current Event Club
at their meeting last Monday started
the laudable movement for a free lib
rary in the V. I. 8. rooms in the City
Hall. Prof. Vincent promised to have
the boys of the Manual Training depart
ment of the high school make the
shelves for the books, and the King's
Daughters volunteered to contribute
the juvenile books. The Current Event
Club will also supply some of the neces
sary books for the library.

curred this week in Firth. Milo Andrus

MR- THEODORE LOROH
RETURNS TO ORPHEUM
-
Fortunately Mr. 8. Boyd has arrang
od for one more engagement of the dis
tinguished Russian actor, Mr. Theodore
Lorch and his excellent company which
will commence Monday evening, Feb
ruary 21st and close Wednesday even
ing of that week.
During Mr. Lorch's engagement this
time he will present ' ' The Man Who
Does Things, a four-act comedy
drama from the pen of Mr. Alfred
Sutro, and the greatest "crook" play
ever staged, "Alias Jimmy Valentine-'
So many regrets have been expressed
by the people of Blackfoot on account
of Mr. Lorch not playing ' ' Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde" during his last engage
ment here that it is possible that lie
will arrange to give a performance of
this, his masterpiece, on his last night
of this engagement. It all depends on
the demands that come from the people
for this play. Owing to the great
strains on Mr. Lorch when playing this
most morbid piece he is not anxious to
give it unless the desire is great enough
to justify his efforts.—adv.
ANOTHER GUBERNATORIAL
ANNOUNCEMENT
D. W. Davis, president of the First
National Bank of American Falls, will
make his formal announcement as a
candidate for governor on the repub
lican ticket at the Lincoln Day dinner
to be served in Boise on the night of
the 12th.
It is to be hoped that D- W. will not
mar the occasion by repeating the slam
on Idaho editors that D. E. Davis, his
opponent, did while here and felsewhore.
This truly good man who threw his hat
into the gubernatorial ring from the
sacred confines of a Nampa church,
stated that it was his belief that the
editor who sold his editorial space
would sell the virtue of his wife, and
strange to say we have never heard
that terrible belief questioned. What a
terrible accusation to make against the
wives of ye editors—and not be refuted.
SURPRISE PARTY
Miss Verna Robertson and Lenont
Jordon last Friday evening gave a
pleasant surprise party at the Robert
son home in honor of Clifford Robert
son, who has recently returned from
g twenty-five month's mission in Ten
nessee for the L. D. S. church. There
were about twenty-five guests present
who enjoyed a pleasant evening and
palatable refreshments. Mr. Robertson
reported a very successful mission for
his church, and the making of many
friends whose company he reluctantly
had to part with.
BASKET BALL
The basket ball game last Friday
night between the Aberdeen boys and
the Blackfoot high school team at the
high school gymnasium, resulted in a
victory for the home boys, by a small
majority of about four. The game was
an initial one for the visititg team who
were heavier than our boys, but less
experienced
ROYAL NEIGHBORS ENTERTAIN
The Royal Neighbor's lodge enter
tained the Modern Woodmen last night
in the Odd Fellows' Hall. A musical
program was given in which the Wood
man band played several selections. A
banquet followed in which all present
took part, and a large part of the men)
bers of both the lodge's were present
!t was a success in every way, and one
if the best socials the lodge has given
.'or some time.
Idaho Falls Hankering
for Our Land Office
The Idaho Falls Commercial Club
seems to be in the hands of H. W
Kiefer and Attorney Oles who are pull
ing all known wires to have this juicy
federal plum removed from Blackfoot
to their own city for very good person
al reasons of their own first and Idaho
Falls next. "Hank," ns Mr. Kiefer
is familiarly known, was register of
the land oflice at Blackfoot for many
years, and succeeded in piling up an
independent fortune which he was all
the time investing in Bonneville coun
ty. During his many years of residence
in Blackfoot he was always kept in
oflice, and his many political and per-'
sonal friends believe he has developed
into a political ingrate 'through his
chronic and malignant itch for political
oflice. "Hank," like most political
prognosticators, is judging the future
I by the past, ami thinks there is but
one chance in many of another Demo
Jrratic administration, and he is ftgur
hug on another indefinite term as regi«t
Jer of the land office if he can have it
removed to his present home city. And
as he is a professional and indefatig
ble rustler for political soft snaps, and
thoroughly familiar with the ways and
means that lead to the land office pie
^ counter, his only obstacle in getting
there is the re-election of Woodrow
Wilson.
The land office is the most valuable
asset of our city. It has seven em
ployees and a monthly payroll of $1,255

SELF EXPLANATORY
Shelley, Idaho, Feb. 4, 1916.
Regarding the item concerning the
sudden and mysterious disappearance
of J. B. Sage and wife, from their homo
in Shelley, for parts unknown, that ap
peared in the last issue of your paper,
published at Blackfoot, Idaho, will say
this:
This matter was first called to my at
tention this morning by one of Black
foot's responsible citizens, and later in
the day by others. 1 want to state for
your own information, and ask thnt
you make a correction of this item in
your next paper, I believe that goes
from the press next Wednesday, Feb.
9th, 1916, and this statement is not
hearsay nor street gossip, but direct and !
correct, and my people are entitled to a
retraction of such an item, of insinua
tion and reflection, through the same
source of its origin.
The address of J. B. Sage and wife
today and the remainder of the time of
their mysterious whereabouts, will be
1904 East Fifth street, Long Beach,
California, which is the address of my
father's sister and family who reside
in California. Same address will reach
my mother's sister and husband who
accompanied them on their vacation
trip to California, whose home address
is Ashton, Idaho.
I want to thank you personally to
attend to this correction, and do not
want to ask for something that my
people are not entitled to. I would also
appreciate a marked copy of your paper
of this particular issue. I am,
Very respectfully,
N. S. SAGE.
CARD PARTY
Last Tuesday afternoon Mrs. W. A.
Lee entertained a number of her lady
friends at her home with a very enjoy
able card party, consisting of eight -
tables. Auction bridge was the game,
and the lucky players who won the
prizes were Mesdames Dolph Johnson
and C. C. Hayes of Montana.
The Methodist ladies have formed
two societies, the Reds and Blues. The
Blues sold 12 cakes Saturday at Pear
son's grocery store, with a gain of $8,
which went to the church. The Reds '
will give their sale Saturday, February I
12th, at Pearson 'a. I

including rentals. A great deal of this
money is spent in Blackfoot where
these employees and their families live
and are desirous of remaining here
where they have established happy
homes. Aside from this the land offiqo
is an unavoidable magnet that attracts
people from everywhere who are look
ing for land. As a rule land olfice
visitors are both spenders and invest
ors, and their presence, whether tem
porary or permanent, is of incalculable
benefit to land olfice cities w-hose pros
perity should not be tampered with to
satisfy the ambition of political ofliee
seekers.
We would admonish the wise ones
who think the Blackfoot land office is
a fixture not to copper "Hank" to
lose, as he is a professional in the
game of politics, and always has several
good cord3 up his sleeve mid knows
how to play them in this game where
pull generally gets the pot. lie will I
likely have a majority of the South
eastern Idaho Press Club to back him,
and its veteran president, Rigby Jones,
ias already spoken thusly:
"Now that the federal building at
Idaho Falls is completed the citizens
and boosters of that town are going af
ter the land office, wanting it removed
from Blackfoot to that city. Consid
ering the central location and the spa
cious quarters that would be possible
in the new building, here's hopin' that
they get the removal."—Rigby Star.
SURPRISE PARTY
Miss Ada anil John Chapman were
happily surprised Tuesday evening, it
being their birthday. A numbor of
their friends proceeded to celebrate the
occassion. About twenty young peo
ple were present. Among them were,
Vern and Clifford Robertson, Leorna
Jordon, Hazel and Mildred Wright,
Florence and Edna Parkinson, Anna
Heese, Clete Nelson, Orson and Lucy
Davis, and Mr. and Mrs- W. C. Chap
man. The evening was spent in play
iag games, and delicious refreshments
were served. The merry party depart
ed for their homes about 1 o'clock,
well satisfied with the evening's merri
ment.
TAX TITLES SECURED
BY FORECLOSURE
A law was passed by the last legis
lature providing that before a tax title
could be obtained the holder of the
lien must file a foreclosure suit and
proceed exactly as in a foreclosure un
der mortgage. As to the properties tak
en over by the county on account of
delinquent taxes, it was made the duty
of the county attorney to bring a fore
closure suit against each separate piece
of property.
This law became effective in 1913
and properties sold for delinquent taxes
of that year became subject to fore
closure this year.
Before these suits are filed an ab
stract of title for each piece must be
obtained, so that the attorney can'
know against whom to bring the suits.
The entire cost of foreclosure will
amount to about $75 in each case
Not all of this sum must be paid out
in cash, as the fees of county offic
ials are included in these costs, and
these, of course, will be returned to
the county, but the cost of abstract
ing, and publication and a $3 state
filing fee in each case must be paid,
The entire costs of $75 or more in
each case will be charged up against
the properties, the owners of which will
be required to pay if they redeef. In
the course of time, many years, per
haps, the county may be able to Bell
the unredeemed properties for the de
linquent taxes and costs taxed up
against them, but many of these pro
perties are town lots that are not
worth the costs.
Kverybody welcome,
