Aaron Paxson was born May
26, 1851, and departed this life
on Feb. 5, 1916, aged 64 years, 8
months and 10 days.

Paxson of Alexandria, Ohio

Ohio.
Deceased was married to Sarah
C. Null of Delaware county, Indi
ana, on Oct 2, 1873. He moved
with his wife to this county in
February, 1881, and resided here
continuously up to the time of
his death. To this anion ten
children were born, eight of

Mrs. Maud Stoskopf and Miss

ago.
Mr. Paxson was ill a long time,
but during his long illness he
was a patient sufferer, no word
of complaint coming from him.
He was given the best of medi
cal attention and loving hands
did all that was possible to save
him. He realized, however that
he was not to get well, and
seemed to be more concerned as
to bis family than about himself.
The wife and children are go
ing to miss the kindness and
good counsel of Mr. Paxson, and
the community will miss a good
man.
Mr. Paxson was a member of
the Modern Woodmen of America
Always a hard worker, he
amassed quite a competence. He
was square in his dealing with
his fellow man, and had the con
fidence of all with whom he had
dealings of any kind.
Funeral services were held
Monday, and the remains were
interred in the Baxter cemetery.
The Presbyterian Ladies Aid
will meet with Mrs. Carmicbael
