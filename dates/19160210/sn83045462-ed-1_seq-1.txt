IS TOLD COMMITTEE
Social Workers Urge Bill for
Survey of D. C. Living
Conditions.
FIVE DOLLARS A WEEK
IS ALL SOME RECEIVE
One Woman Declares She Got Two
Two-Cent Stamps for Three
Hours' Work.
I ?>r a change, a congressional i
committee today heard of small
amounts of money, and cars that
have l>ccn listening to appeals for
a million dollars for this and two
million for that and preparedness
programs of a half billion or more
today heard of shop girls who are
barely keeping sotil and body together
on less than S5 a week.
The hearing was that of the j
District committee on the Keating
resolution to authorize the
Department of Labor to make a
survey of conditions in the District
of Columbia so as to report
the cost of living.
Many for Minimum Wage.
At least fifty well known social work
rs appearen ai me nearuig, uidisimicu
by Mrs. Florence Kelley. national sec- j
retarv of the Consumers' league:' and
it appeared that what many of them i
were favoring? as the ultimate legisla- J
tion is a law specifying a minimum
wage for women and girls at work in j
the District. j
The hearing was well conducted, and !
s< arcely a superfluous word was uttered '
Two or three of the women who spoke,
imply told the story of how a few t
bop girls are living on <>r less a '
week. Miss Z. S. Falk of the Washington
organization of the Consumers'
l.eague showed an apron which she
herself made under the guise of a
weatship worker. The "boss" paid her j
two 2-cent stamps for her three hours' i
work on the garment, she said.
"We believe the chief cause of pov- ;
friy in me uistnci is not sni11ipssness |
nd drunkenness, but underpay." said ;
Representative Keating of Colorado, j
"In the eight-hour law we have rid the
city of overwork to a great extent. It !
Js now important to get rid of 'under- j
pay.' He spoke of the average depart- i
ment store pay for women as $6.50 a !
week, and said that in factories and ;
laundries the pay is lower. He gave
figures to show that it costs between
IS and $5# a week to live in lodgififn^lti
proper fashion: and he said that women
living at home generally have an added
burden of helping along other members
of the family.
Waiting on Supreme Court.
Representative Tinkham of .Massachusetts
asked Mrs. Kelley why she
did not make a direct move toward a
minimum wage law or to refer the
resolution direct to the Department of
Labor. Mrs. Kelley pointed out that un- i
t'i the Supreme Court of the United j
States makes a decision in the Oregon!
as*, affecting minimum wage, the Consumers'
League arid other organiza.-uns
do not believe it wise to recorn
nd such a bill.
'If the Supreme Court decides against
:s we will then be ?orifrontcd
with the heart breaking: task of chang.r.%
the Constitution.'* said Mrs. Kellev.
*ln the meantime we believe Washgton
one of the tnost beautiful cities
. and also one of the most expensive
ities for working: people."
"Is it not possible." interjected Rep*entative
Mapes of Michigan. "that
-v'en if a minimum wage law is not
enacted, the public sentiment created
by a study of cost of Jiving conditions
would force an increase in some of the
underpaid employments. V"
'Vex. that is quite possible."
Says Wages Are Too Low.
Walter S. I'fford, sec-rotary of the As-o'
iated Charities, said "tlue wages paid
In several unskilled occupations here
are too low" He said that he is con
Yinceo )i '?? a nay is not enough for
day laborers and that %'Z a day would
be much nearer requirements for the
white wings." He said that $1.07 is
the average. Representative ? *a ry said
that ?2 cents is nearer the average.
"The reason is that the department
spends too much money for automobiles
not authorized by t'origress, and
takes the Jump suns appropriation away
from the wages for the men that* do
the work "
Miss Van Trump's story of a woman
at Neighborhood House made a deep
irepression:
"She is a little mother, a widow with
two children," said Miss Van Trump.
She ? ame to us to put her children in

A
ORGANIZE 10 BLOCK
COLONEL'SCHANCES
Old-Line Republicans Would
Prevent Roosevelt Stampede
at Convention.
|
PRECAUTIONS ARE TAKEN
TO CONTROL DELEGATES
Former President's Supporters Hope
to Create Idea He Is Only Renublican
Who Can Be Elected.
A compact organization of able
old-line republican leaders, with
headquarters in New York, is taking
every precaution to prevent
the nomination of Col. Theodore
Roosevelt bv the next republican
national convention, and those
who know of the inside workings
of the concern declare themselves
a- having "no fear" that the colonel
will be able to stampede the
convention and bring about his
own nomination.
As evidences multiply that the colonel
is groin*? to be a perfectly willing
candidate for the nomination, the organization
referred to is making extra
efforts to offset the energetic schemes
of the Roosevelt supporters, who lustily
declare that their man will be
nominated.
The struggle between the Roosevelt
and anti-Roosevelt leaders is the most
interesting feature of the pre-presldential
campaign. Plenty of money is
back of each organization. The Roosevelt
men. led by George W. Perkins.
Cecil Lyon of Texas and others, are
planning day and night to pick off delegates
here and there for the colonel,
these delegates to do everything within
their power, when the convention
meets, to bring about a tie-up of favorite
son candidates, so that the name
of Roosevelt may be sprung when it
looks as if no man before the convention
can be nominated.
Plans of Roosevelt Men.
In every way possible the idea is to
be dinned into republicans through the
country that Col. Roosevelt "is the
orrly republican who can be elected."
If that idea can be fixed in the minds
of a million or so republicans it will
be n tremendous asset for the Oyster
Bay statesman in the convention.
Roosevelt supporters of prominence are
to cet their views along this line into
newspapers wherever it is possible to
do so, and the Roosevelt organization?
for there is one of large proportions
and well financed?will attempt to obtain
the nomination of old-time Roosevelt
men as delegates in every state
and congressional district. These men
may permit themselves to be pledged
for other candidates and will abide by
their pledges up to the psychological
moment. Then they will join the readyprepared
stampede for the colonel and
lit will "all be over."
! But the anti-Roosevelt men see and
j understand the game fully. They are
beginning to spread the idea that
"any good republican" nominated by
the convention can be elected. They
feel that the best antidote to Hoose[
velt as "the only man who can be
! elected * is a widespread feeling of
I confidence that "any good republican"
I will win. With this as their slogan
they are going ahead quietly, surely
[and safely, it is said, in perfecting
I every possible scheme to s^e that men
I selected as delegates in the different
states are not of the sort to be stampeded
atid will not go to Roosevelt
under any circumstances.
A prominent Ohio progressive, who
wns Intimatp with RnnsAvr- t In th#
1 White House as any other man in the
country, was recently in Washington.
He told a close friend that it looked
[as if the old-line republicans in Ohio,
: in making up the ticket of delegates
I to the national convention for the prli
maries In that state, will prevent any
1 real Roosevelt sympathizer from getting
through in the primaries. The
delegates, all for Burton for President.
. will at the same time be cast iron
a nti - Roosevelt fellows of the old-line
type, sturdy of jaw and not easily subject
to great clamor and uproar in a
national convention.
Same All Along the Line.
In New York the same method will
be applied. So man of Roosevelt tendencies
will be placed upon the republican
ticket, of delegates in the primaries.
Pennsylvania old-line men will
look after the same thing in that
state, and so all along the line.
A perfect organization is known to
he looking after this especial feature,
inawTrmch a it i?i rfcnim i nil
| conditions in the republican national
I convention will favor the sudden
j springing of the name of the former
! i'resioent or of some dark horse who
an ''ommami grejit force in the excit|
itig nioiiients sure to come. There will
: i?e a berg** number of "favorite son"
(Candidates before the convention. Many
. ballots may ensue without a selection,
j The Roosevelt talk will go on every
f minute and every hour Strong men
j only will be able to resist the ap|>ea-l
i v. hen numerous ballots have been
: taken without result.
j The ant i - Roosevelt organization is
'steering Hear of any preference as
i among the old-line candidates. It is
j supposed to be impartial and to look
wholly toward procuring a band of
i republican spartans whose first aim
will be to keep i'ol. Roosevelt off the
' head of the ticket.
The work of the organization is beting
carried on with as little outward
j:?: imosity as possible to Col. HouseI

that harmony is to be desired
and that they must have the O. K

DISPUTES CHARGE
AGAINST BRANDEIS
James W. Carmalt. Chief Examiner
for I. C. C.. Before
Senate Subcommittee.
|CHALLENGES ASSERTION
! ATTITUDE WAS CONCEALED
"No Disposition to Keep It From
Mr. Thome." He Says?Frank
Lyon Also Testifies.
|
! "
i lames \V. Carmalt. chief examiner
of the interstate commerce
commission, before the
Senate subcommittee investigat- j
ing the nomination of f.ouis D.
Brandeis to the Supreme Court
bench today, challenged the declaration
of Clifford Thome, chair-1
man of the Iowa railroad commis-l
sion, that Mr. Brandeis had con- j
cealed from him the attitude he i
would take in arguing the eastern i
freight rate case before the com-1
mission.
Yesterday Mr. Thorne. who was associated
with Mr. Brandeis in the trial
of the rate case for shippers and the
commission, declared lie* was "dumbfounded"*
when Mr. Brandeis at the outset
of his closing argument conceded j
the contention of the railroads that
existing rate returns were inadequate
for the prosperity of the roads and the
best interests of the public.
"There is one incident firmly fixed
in my mind," said Mr. Carmalt. "regarding
a conversation Mr. Thorne had
with me on the second day of the argument
of the rate case. Mr. Thorne,
I understand, stated that when the
commission fixed the allotment of time
for attorneys to argue the case he had
asked the privilege of being permitted
to follow counsel for the shippers instead
of opening the argument.
Mr. Brandeis' Position Known.
"Mr. Thorn asked me what Mr. Brandels'
position would be in the argument.
There was no doubt in my mind what
Mr. Brandeis' position would be. i had
discussed it with him and he had told
me. Ther4 certainly was no disposition to
conceal it from Mr. Thorne. I am confident
that I told Mr. Thorne that Mr.
Brandeis would take the position that
the net operating income of the carriers
was not adequate, with special stress on
the Central Freight Association territory.
Further. I said, he would take the
position that the methods pursued by the
carriers to obtain greater revenues
through a horizontal 5 per cent increase
was not the proper method of increasing
their revenues.
"I am quite clear that it was as the
result of this conversation that Mr.
Thorne wrote Mr. Brandeis a note asking
about a change in the allotment
of time. It is very strongly my impression
that because Mr. Thorne recognized
the attitude Mr. Brandeis would
take that Mr. Brandeis got the conception
that Mr. Thorne wanted an oppor- ,
tunity to answer him in addition to his
main argument in the case."
Mr. Carrnalt was called to the stand
on suggestion of George w. Anderson.
United States district attorney in Boston.
who is attending the hearings.
His testimony was regarded by friends
of Mr. Brandeis as being very much in
his favor.
Mr. Brandeis Aided Mr. Thorne.
I chairman Chilton stated that his unI
derstanding was that Mr. Brandeis was j
! emoloved to assist in developing "a II j
sides of the case," and asked Mr. Car- \
malt if Mr. Brandeis helped Mr. Thorne I
develop his side. Mr. Carmalt replied
that lie did and said that the data <*oI- I
lected irom the railroads bv the corn-|
mission under the general direction of j
.Mr. Brandeis were available to all.
Senator Clark asked if Mr. Brandeis |
was not employed to develop the "other
side of the case" on the assumption
! that the railroads' side would be ade- j
quately cared for.
"He was not retained for the railroads."
responded Mr. Carmalt. "He
wp.s to develop the whole case.'
"Including the case for the railroads".'"
"1 think the commission assumed the I
railroads' case would be taken care of 1
by their attorneys."
"Were Mr. Brandeis' activities de- j
voted to the side of railroads?" per- i
slsted the senator.
"The record, 1 think, shows that they1
were employed to develop the other
side."
"When you told Mr. Thorne of the
conclusion Mr. Brandeis had reached,"
!asked Senator Clark, "did he express
surprise?"
"Yes, he did.
No Conference of Attorneys.
In response^ to Senator Walsh, Mr.
Carmalt sai<r there never was, so far
as lie knew, a conference of attorneys
representing the shippers to exchange
views on preparation of the argument
in the ease.
"How did Mr. Brandeis come to disclose
to you what his conclusion was
as to adequacy of railroad revenues.?"
Senator Walsh asked.
J don't know, except that we were
associated together in the office, and
he just told me that when lie came to
the argument he proposed to take the
position which lie did.
Cnder cross-examination by Senator
ji'ummins Mr. Carmalt testified Mr.
I jlrandeis did not merely state his view
ithat the net revenue of the railroads
! u, as insufficient, but he announced
| j that such would be his position in the
, arguments of the < ase.
; j "Did Mr. Brandeis discuss the pro.
I pi'iety of his making this concession.
i which was the vital point of the case
| made up by Mr. Therne?" asked Sena[
i tor Cumtnins.
"So, and It did not occur to me as
! being improper."
: Mr Carmalt's testimony then ended
and the subcommittee had an argument
r over the conduct of the hearing.
Senator Walsh Wants Facts.
"This investigation." said SenatorWalsh.
"is for- the purpose of developt
ing facts to advise the committee with
respect to the fitness of this nominee.
Witnesses have been allowed to express
in a general way opinion formed concerning
the nominee. I am led to he1
lie.ve that some of the witnesses summoned
know little about substantial
facts, but have only learned things

p rumor. 1 shall insist that witnesses be

Mrs. Kuhn was to have received today
at her quarters at Washington
barracks in honor of Mrs. Garrison. J;
The tragic termination of Mrs. Garri-j;
came as a great shock, not only lo||
those present, but to the hundreds of t
friends of Mrs. Kuhn throughout the *

From Tanker.
Secretary Lansing announced
today tliat lie had sent to tlic
| Austro-1 lungarian government,
1 inrongn .Miiuassatlur I'enheld. a
| dispatch asking for an investigation
and an explanation of the
attack bv an Austrian submarine
on the American tank steamer
Petrolite.
No Demand Made 3Tet.
The Secretary said published state;
ments that demands had been made
upon the Vienna government were "not
true." but that it was within the range
of possibility that demands of some
sort might be made in the future
should the investigation and explana!
f f on nuked uarrant tham
The Secretary's dispatch called attention
to affidavits from members of the
crew of the Petrolite and to information
from other sources to the effect
| that the ship was stopped in the MediI
terranean near Alexandria by an Aus|
trian submarine which fired upon her
I and wounded one man in her engine
room.
Took Food From Tanker.
The submarine commander asked for
food, which Capt. Thompson of the Petrolite
refused. He thereupon sent a
boarding party on the American ship
and removed one American member of
her crew, who was held as a hostage
while the Austrians took the food they
required from the Petrolite's stores.
Novel questions are involved in the
case. Warships under certain stress
may take food from merchantmen if
they give proper receipts or payment,
but" it is realized that if submarines
are to be permitted to do so every neutral,
ship might be made a base for
their operations.
