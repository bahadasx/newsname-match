ATES
BY BRANDEIS
James W. Carmalt, Expert of
the Interstate Commerce
Commission First Wit
ness Thursday.
ALL CHARGES MUST
BE MADE UNDER OATH
Sub-Committee Decides to
Have All Testimony Sworn
to Few Spectators
Attend Hearing.
Internntlonal News Service:
WASHINGTON. Feb. 10. Charges
against Louis D. Brandeis, Pres't
Wilson's candidate for the supreme
court, must be made under oath.
The senate judiciary sub-committee
investigating the qualifications of
the candidate for the supreme bench
today notified witnesses that all tes
timony will be sworn hereafter and
exparte statements would not be
accepted.
A scattering of spectators was on
hand for today's hearing.
James W. Carmalt, an expert of
the interstate commerce commis
sion, the tlrst witness of the day,
took direct issue with Clifford D.
Thome's charges against Brandeis
made yesterday. He declared that
before admitting in his argument in
the 191 H freight rate advance cases
that the railroads revenues were in
adequate. Mr. Brandeis had made
his position on that point clear to
his associate counsel.
Needed .More Income.
"Some time before Mr. Braudels
made his argument," said Carmalt.
"I had been working with him in
preparing his case. 1 know that he
believed the railroads needed more
revenue. I talked to Mr. Thorne
about this and my recollection is
clear that I told him that Mr.
Brandeis would admit that the roads
needed more net income."
"Wa? Mr. Brandeis employed by
the commission to represent the
railroads, the shippers or the pub
lic?" asked Sen. Clark.
"He was employed to represent
all of them, to see that all phase- of
the case were developed." answered
Carmalt.
"Didn't the commission determine
that the railroads were adeqjately
represented and that Mr. Brindeis
should confine his efforts to the
shippers' and the public's side of the
case?"
"I believe they did."
"Didn't Mr. Brandeis use his tal
ents for the benefit of the railroads
as against the puvoic?"
"The record would show that."
Democrats Win Point.
As Garmalt left the stand a split
developed over the manner of con
juncting the examination. The re
publican members. Sens. Clark and
Cummins, opposed the proposal of
the democrats to swear all witnesses
and lonfine the testimony to mat
ters of fact. The protest was inef
fectual and the democrats insisted
on the restrictions.
Frank Lyon, a Washington law
yer who wa: employed by the inter
state commerce commission as spe
cial counsel in the 1910 rate case,
was the next witness. He defended
Mr. Brandete.
Thomas C. Spelling of New York,
formerly attorney for the interstate
commerce commission and former
assistant attorney general, next took
the Manu.
Spelling talked for an hour about
various proceedings before the in
terstate commerce commission. Hi
principal complaint against Bran
deis was that the latter had kept for
six weeks a brief that Spelling sub
mitted to him for his approval.
Spelling said that he wanted the
brief because he wanted to tile it
ith iho commission.

FRENCH AVIATORS ARE
SEEKING BIG GUN
Hope to Locate Cannon Csed to
Destroy Bclfort For
tress. Internntl"n;il News Service:
PARIS, Feb. lo. German guns
believed to have a range of more
than 20 miles are being used in a
systematic effort to destroy Reifert,
the mighty fortress that forms the
keystone of the French defense on
the eastern frontier. On Tuesday
and Wednesday 10 shells were hurl
ed into Belfort by these mighty
cannon, which are believed to be
the latest output of the Krupp fac
tory al Fssen.
French aviators are trying to as
certain the location of the guns,
which are probably mounted in
some hidden recess of the Vosges
mountains. When their position is
determined French officers declare it
will be a simple matter for an air
squadron to put them out of com
mission by dropping bombs.
It will be recalled that last year
a giant cannon bombarded Dun
kirk from a point 22 miles away,
but after a raid by combined British
and French aeroplane squadrons bo
hind the Germa'n lines nothing more
was heard of the monster guns.

Bill Which Was Signed by

Now Effective.

LONDON. Feb. 1 0. Conscription
in England is now a fact.
The military service bill, provid
ing for compulsory military service
went into effect today in accordance
with the privy council proclamation
signed by King George on Feb. 3.
The conscription bill is designed
to bring into the army approximate
ly .D,414 available single men who
failed to attest themselves while the
Derby recruiting scheme was in
operation, and open the way for
married men who have been hold
ing back.
In his report on the success of his
recruiting campaign Lord Derby es
timated that C.öl.ißo bachelors of
military age had failed to enroll.
However, basing the computation
upon the same Jigures that were ap
plied to the Derby volunteers it U
estimated that approximately :;3 4.
696 men must be deducted for va
rious regions.
The following classes of people
are excused from service under the
conscription bill:
Conscientious objections, men
with dependents, last sons of moth
ers, ministers of all denominations,
the unfit, those in the service, but
not those enlisted for home service
only, men on national work and
men rejected since Aug. 14, 1915.
The Derby recruiting scheme,
which was in effect while the con
