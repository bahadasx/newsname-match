Mike il Slashed Over the Heart
.•Mult of Joshing With
Negro Porter
Ir lit of temper, as the climax of
a thing conversation, Seymore
.dngton, a colored barber shop
iter, made a vicious assault with
a pocket knife on Mike O'NeilSatur
day afternoon while both were at
work in the shop in the Calderwood
building on Main. O'Neil received
two long clashes across 'the left 'ribs.
One cut, had it been a quarter of an
inch deeper, would have reached the
heart and been fatal.
The barber and the porter were car
rying on a joshing, kidding conversa
tion as was their frequent habit, but
Saturday the porter had been imbib
ing too freely, a habit that is said to
often result in arousing an uncon
trolable temper. Without warning the
negro hurled a vile epithet and flew
at O'Neil who defended himself with
•the head rest of his chair but the
'blows had little effect on his assailant
who persisted in his murderous assault
•and might have accomplished his pur
pose had not several men in the shop
•come to the barter's aid.
Clings To Knife
'Overpowered and held on the floor
"by three men, Washington tftfll kept
a-grip on his weapon ,a two-bladed,
medium sized pocket knife. O. A.
Lohrke, an attorney whose office is
next door, and who, in the capacity of
assistant states attorney, had pre
viously made the acquaintance of
'Washington, finally persuaded him to
give up the knife which showed stains
'from O'Neil's blood.
Second Offense
Chief'Nolan was soon on the scene
«nd took the' still angry and excited
•man in charge and lodged him in jail.
Assault With a dangerous weapon was
-the charge prefered by States Attor

A. Lohrke as his attorney and when
brought before Justice A. J. Field
Wednesday "for a hearing waived ex
amination. "Bonds of $900. not being
furnished he occupies a rcell in the
county jail awaiting trial.

Reported Kitchener
Will Be Relieved
JLsndon, Feb. 7.—Changes of great
importance in the direction of the war
are nontemplated says the Daily
Sketch. It asserts that Earl KStchen
V«er
probably will leave the war office,
The Sketch also says Sir WVliam
Robertson, now chief of the staff,
probably will take over the active .di
,j
rection of the war without interfer
I enee, except from the eabinet as a
whole, and that civilian of real ability

retary for the war.
PAST MONTH IS DEGREES COLD
ER THAN NORMAL
January, 1916, goes onto the weath
er bureau records as a cold month with
a capital for it was a near record
breaker in many localities. The rec
ords of the local station show but one
January with as low a mean average
temperature. The past month aver
'aged on hourly readings 8.4 degrees
minus, or below zero January 1907
I averaged 9 degrees minus. Those two
form the coldest pair of months in 39
years so it is reasonable to assume
that the worst is not yet to come but
is over with for some time. One morn
ing ,the 12th, touched 42 below for
a short time, the next morning was
40, the 27th got down to 34 and sev
eral were in the twenties. The warm
est registered during the month was
[S2 above.
The local normal for the month is
.5 above zero so the past month was
learly 15 degrees below the average.
There were plenty of colder spots in
"le Northwest than Williston. The
trecord at Havre shows a mean aver
/age for the month of 13 degrees below
S2nd a range of from 57 below to 22
above.

City Schools Open
Savings Bank Dep't.
System Worked Out To Encourage
Habits of Saving In the Children
—Begin 11TH
After a series of delays, supplies
are now at hand for the starting of
the School Savings Bank.
The establishment of the Savings
Bank in the city schools is in keeping
with a general movement throughout
the country, which has the full en
dorsement of educators and Bankers'
Associations. In this state, Fargo
and Grand Forks have operated sav
ings banks in the schools for some
years, while Bismarck and a few oth
er cities and towns have established
them more recently.
It is to be understood that the
school is in no ways a depository. The
money is not kept at school at all.
Arrangements have been made with
the First National Bank to keep the
savings, and the accounts are kept
in the same manner as under any
savings bank system.
The part of the school is this:—
The teachers keep an accurate record
of all money brought by the children,
giving each child a record eard. A
duplicate is kept with the principal
and further record is made at the
bank.
School Can Encourage
On Friday, February 11, the first
opportunity will be given for the plac
ing of children's money in the School
Savings Bank every succeeding Fri
day will be Savings Bank Day. Every
child is expected to bring as much
money as he can to start his account.
Coins in any amount are taken' for
registration, whether lc, 5c, or any
number of dollars.
"While it is recognized that many
parents are encouraging their chil
dren to save by means of banks at
home or even savings accounts, the
school is particularly adapted to the
encouraging of savings, because of
the regularity of deposit and, particu
larly, because of the stimulation that
comes from seeing other children do
ing the same thing. It would be an
excellent plan if children who have
money of theii* own in little banks or
kept other ways to deposit this in the
School 'Savings Bank.
Villa Would Force
U. S. Intervention
Declares He Will Cross American
Border and Bring Intervention
In Six Weeks
El Paso, Texas, Feb. 8.—The dee
claration that he would force inter
vention by the United States within
six weeks is attributed to Francisco
Villa by a Mexican from Madera and
brought to the attention of American
officials here and Mexican officials at
Juarez. According to the Meixcan in
formant, Villa declared he would cross
the international border and hold up
an El Paso and Southwestern railroad
train if intervention could be produc
ed in no other way. General Gavira.
commandant at Juarez, is without
word today on the progress made by
Carranza troops in their search for
Villa. The last word received at the
•military headquarters in Juarez re
ported that Villa was with 25 men in
the teanyon De El Nido.
Bandits Infect Country
New York. Feb. 8.—A party of four
American mining engineers, who ar
rived here from Vera Cruz aboard the
steamer Esperanza, reported that the
train on which they traveled from
Mexico City to Vera Cruz has been
under constant fire from bandits
throughout the entire journey.
The engineers said they left Vera
Cruz two weeks ago, and traveled in
an armored car which carried four 3
inch guns. According to their story,
the whole territory between Mexico
City and the sea coast is infested
with bandits.
Carranza's Power Waning
Dr. Jorn R. Davis, American physi
cian in Mexico City, is quoted as say
ing that there are several thousand
cases of typhus fever in the capital,
and that small pox is raging1 at Tam
pico. The engineers asserted that
Carranza's power is waning and that
General Obregon is the man of the
hour in Mexico City.
CANADIAN FARMERS FREEZE
Winnipeg, Feb. 8.—Charles Pur
cell of Saskatchewan Landing in the
Swift Current, Sask., district, was
frozn todeath while returning home
from delivering grain. The body was
found last night. Nels Knudson, a
wealthy farmer of Midale, Sask., was
found frozen to death yesterday. Two
sons live at Westby, Mont.

BILL IS PASSED
BILL REPORTED FAVORABLY
BY SENATE COMMITTEE
Congress Will Not Be Detered In
Plans To Equip Mare Island
Niv
Yard
Washington, Feb. 8.—Private arm
or plate manufacturers notified the
senate naval committee that they
would raise the price of armor plate
9200 per ton if congress decided to
erect or purchase armor plate fac
tories for the government.
For Government Plats
Committee nevertheless voted to
recommend government plants. After
brief consideration, the committee or
dered favorably reported the bill au
thorizing the epexnditures of $500,000
to equip the Mare Island Navy Yard
for battleship construction, $100,000
to enlarge the facilities of the New
York navy yard, and the bill to add
three hundred midshipmen to the first
class at Annapolis next June.
These two bills passed the house
yesterday.
Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania,
republican, notified the committee of
the stand of the armor plate manu
facturers, those concerned chiefly be
ing the Bethlehem and Midvale Steel
companies.
Committee voted nevertheless, nine
to three, to report favorably Senator
Tillman's bill to authorize the secre
tary of nevy, to provide either by the
erection or purchase of an armor plate
factory or both, with a capacity of
not less than 20,000 tons of armor
per year. The bill would appropriate
$11,000,000. Senators Penrose, Lodge,
Smith of Michigan, republicans, voted
against reporting the bill. Chairman
Tillman and Senators Swanson, Bryan,
Johnson, Maine, Chilton, Phelan, Pitt
man, democrats and Clapp and Poin
dexter, republicans voted for it.
Will Not Affect Congress
"The threat of the armor plate
barons to hold up the government will
not affect congress," said Senator Till
man.
"We are given to understand that
the armor plate manufacturers would
increase their prices because govern
ment manufacturers of armor plate
would force them to go out of that
business, and they would charge the
enormous increases in order to pro
vide themselves with an amortization
fund. But I guess we can find a way
to stop the robbers. In time of trou
ble, we would seize their plants and
operate them by the right of eminent
domain.1*

ABRAHAM LINCOLN
BY JAMES W. FOLEY
A man, rough-hewn, cast in heroic mold
The Sculptor chisels from enduring stone,
With coarse carved lines and lineaments and bold
And set upon a pedestal—alone.
Carved from the stone, a rock to raise the Right
Upon, as Liberty her edifice
Founded on him, and found in him the Might
To close a chasm, bridge a precipice.
A rock the storm-lashed waves beat on in vain
And seas of blood, assaulting, fruitless roll,
The allied thunders of the Mount and Main
Reverberate but shake not that calm soul.
Mighty ,a monarch, Nature wove his crown,
And Justice framed his edits, Right his throne
Love shaped his heart and through the ages down
He lives, a deathless memory, in stone.
The storm breaks, the fire-freighted lightnings play,
Forth to the storm his kingly mandates ring,
Abashed, the unleashed furies slink away
The waves roll back—supreme he stands, a king.
Unmoved, inflexible and stern as steel
The sullen tempest dies before his will,
His hand falls nerveless, dead, that holds the wheel,
The Captain stricken as the sea grows still.
An empty clay beneath an honored sod,
A laurel wreath upon a slab of stone,
A god-like soul restored again to God,
A figure on Fame's pedestal—alone.

AMONG FINEST STRUCTURES
ON AMERICAN CONTINENT
Believed Fire May Have Been Caused
By Bomb Or Infernal Ma
chine—Arrests
Ottawa, Ont., Feb. 5.—Canada's
magnificient parliament building,
which cost more than $6,000,000, lay
in ruins today, swept by afire at
tributed by some to be a bomb or in
fernal machine. At least six lives
were lost and many persons injured.
The known dead are: Mme. Bray,
wife of H. A. Bray of Quebec and
daughter of the late George Tanguay
of the legislative council Mme. Morin,
wife of Louis Morin of St. Joseph de
Beauce, Que. Robert Fanning a wait
er employed in the building Alpt des
Jardins, a dominion policeman, and A.
des Jardins, a plumber. Another do
minion policeman is believed to have
been killed with the des Jardins when
the roof fell upon them while they
were working with others in the
chamber below the speaker's quarters.
Great Financial Loss
William S. Loggie, member of par
liament for Northumberland, N. B.,
is reported missing. It was stated
last night that Frederick F. Pardee,
the chief liberal whip in the house of
commons, also was missing, but it was
subsequently learned that he went to
Sarnia, Ont., yesterday morning and
that hs could not have returned before
the fire.
The financial loss is difficult to es
timate, but the contents of the build
ing were of great value. At an early
hour today it. was evident that the
parliamentary library in a rear wing
had been saved. While the fire was
burning, soldiers carried out many of
its J»i0,000 volumes.
The parliament building was rated
as one of the finest Gothic structures
on this continent. It covered four
acres on Parliament Hill.
Women Trapped
Several persons who were burned
or otherwise hurt in fleeing through
the windows are in hospitals today.
One of those most'severely injured is
Martin Burrell, minister of agricul
ture, who was burned about the head.
Dr. Michael Clark, member for Red
Deer, suffered burns about the hands.
Sir Robert Borden, the Canadian
premier, escaped without injury.
Mme. Bray and Mme. Morin were
guests of Mme. Sevigny, wife of the
speaker, and were trapped in the
speaker's rooms. Mme. Sevigny drop
ped her two children into a 'firemen's
safety net and then leaped into it her
self, as did another of her guests,
Mme. Dussault of Quebec. They es

Important State
Law Declared Valic
Constitutionality of State Bonding
Law Settled By Supreme Court
Decision
The state bonding act, passed by
the last legislature, and which pro
vides for the establishment of a state
bonding department to protect the
state, municipalities, counties and
townships, was today declared consti
tutional, the supreme court, in a unan
imous verdict, upholding the act.
In its decision, the supreme court
overrides the contention raised by the
relators, holding that the state has au
thority to establish the bonding de
partment to cover any shortages, non
feasance or defalcations of public offl
cers.
First Law Failed
The law attacked was the second
passed by the legislature, the first
passed three years ago, being knocked
out in the courts. Senator Ellingson
of Steele county, who conducted the
legislative fight in favor of the meas
ure, persisted in the last assembly
and the present act is the outcome.
In making an attack on the law, the
relators insisted that the state had ex
ceeded its authority in attempting to
establish the bonding department,
claiming the state was going into pri
vate business in competition with
citiezns.
With the success of the state in
maintaining the validity of the bond
ing law, the organization of the de
partment can now proceed, State In
surance Commissioner Taylor being
charged with the duty of launching
the organization.
Com'cl. Club Meeting

Manager McGuiness Secures Much
Sought After Contract For
Big Stuff
Shortly after D. W. Griffith's "Birth
Of A Nation" opened in New York
City, Mr. Atkin, former President of
the Mutual Film Corporation, togeth
er with Mr. Griffith, conceived the
idea of forming a company of three of
the world's greatest motion picture
producers to release pictures, the
quality of which would warrant their
presentations in theatres at advanced
admission prices, ranging from 25
cents up. The outcome of this idea
was that Mr. Griffith, together with
Thomas Ince and Mack Sennett form
ed a ten million dollar corporation,
which is known as the Triangle Film
Corporation.
The Triangle people release two
programs each week, each program
consisting of a five or more reel dra
matic production, directed by either
Mr. Griffith or Mr. Ince, and a two or
more reel comedy from the Keystone
studios, of which Mack Sennett is
Manager and director. The program
has been a success and now the lead
ing theatres, in all the larger and
more important cities, exhibit the
Triangle program.
The first Triangle program will be
presented at the Orpheum theatre on
Thursday, February 17th., the second
program on Saturday, February 19th,
to be followed by anew Triangle pro
gram on Thursday and Saturday of
each week.

DEEP INTEREST
MARKS SESSIONS
THIRD AGRICULTURAL CONVEN
TION NOW IN FULL SWING
LARGE ATTENDANCE
150 MEN AND WOMEN
FROM MANY SECTIONS
First Days Filled By Live Discussions
On Important Topics of Home
And Farm
"I am deeply impressed by the at
tendance and the interest at these
meetings. When this number of men
and women come here from all sorts
of distances, under present weather
conditions, it is proof of something
back of it—you are interested, in
earnest in your work." A. E. Nelson,,
county agent of Steel county.
That is the way the first two days
of the Third Annual Williams County
Agricultural Convention have im
pressed every one present—speakers*
visitors, the farmers themselves^.
There is genuine interest and the
conviction that these winter con
ferences will yield something of value
—something that can be carried away
and will sooner or later prove useful.
The weather, while it might be
worse, is certainly not acting in a
manner calculated to boost the at
tendance. The roads are made heavy
by the constantly falling snow. With
many, home duties make it necessary
to go and return each day if they
come at all. With fair weather and
good roads there would have been at
least 300 farm people at these ses
sions. As it is the total attendance*
will equal or exceed 150. Many stay
for the whole convention but others:
are obliged to confine themselves to
the sessions in which they are most
interested.
Ten Come 25 Miles
Many farm clubs send a few dele
gates to attend the full time and re
port on the work. Probably the larg
est number from one club, certainly
the largest number from such a dis
tance, is the ten representing the Out
look Club whose community is 25
miles north of Williston.
A fair representation of ladies are
attending and it is probable that more'
will be attracted today and tomorrow
by the home economics talks of Miss
McDonald who gives a lecture on food
preparation exclusively to women at
two o'clock this afternoon.
Flavored By Humor
A fine spirit of attentiveness, men
tal alertness and good humor has
been very evident. The speakers«
without exception have kept away
from the stiff, formal, didactic style
of speaking. Mr. Johnson, Mr. Nel-
son, Mr. Hall, Miss McDonald and Mr..
Wenz all got close to their audience
and talked to them and with them in
an informal and
verv
refreshing-
humor and good stories that made an
instant hit wit htheir hearers. Mr.
Nelson, who was raised in Kentucky,
in particular, is a humorist and a.
mimic of no mean ability.

Many Binder
Problem Arguments
Numerous answers have been re
ceived to the binder problem publish
ed two weeks ago. Some agree aatf
some do not. Discussions lengthy and
animated are frequent around town.
It is good fun to stand back and listen
to them. One more week will be al
lowed for those who have not gotten
to it to try their heads on the mathe
matical knot. Next week some of the
answers that have been sent in will
be given—also the demonstrations of
at least one of the results.
The Problem
Two eight-foot binders, the dame
one always in the lead, cut wheat in tt.
square, 160-acre field. Each is pre
sumed to cut a full eight-foot swath
and the head binder always turns the
corners before the second arrives. Af
ter each machine has made 20 fuH
rounds how much more wheat, if any,
(expressed in square feet) has the
head binder cut than the second
binder?
It is assumed that both machinos
.will cut straight out into the stubble
at the end of the 20th round.
PONTOON BRIDGE MEETING
A meeting of those who are agi
tating the important project of a pon
toon bridge across the Missouri at
Williston was held last Thursday
eveing at R. M. Calderwood's office.
It was expected that H. A. Lamb, the
engineer who has been engaged to
draw plans and make blue prints of
them would be able to submit his work
to the meeting but his plans had not
returned from New York where he
sent them to an eminent engineer to
be checked over. Mr. Lamb estimates
that a suitable bridge can be con
structed for $8,500.00. A committee
is engaged on a prospectus of the pro
ject.
