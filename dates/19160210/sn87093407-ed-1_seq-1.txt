On April S9th laat the pontmaater general aunceated to the

,<r«'«eutatl*e« of the two departmenta of the alte purrhaaed t»y
the government tn Hlock 283, Seattle. The reprraeutatlTo# have rv
ported l> follow*:
(1) Thia site Is not dsslrabls from ths standpoint of
• postoffice only. For the purposss of a general fsdsrsl
building It Is very undesirabls.
Ths mall would have to be hauled a dlstancs of
3,100 feet from th« cars to ths sits, and practically all of
It would hava to be hauisd back again for distribution
and diapatch; a spur track could not ba succsaafully opsr
atsd.
(3) No Improvements have boon made In thla vicinity
for elx year*. The Improvementa will, when eventually
made, conelst of manufacturing planta and warehouess.
(4) It Is recommended that the preeent alte be eold,
but they etata that, at the preeent time, not more than 50
per cent of the purchase price could be obtained for It.
(bl It I* recommended that a alte ehould be acquired
which (a) would be convenient of access to the general
public and federal officiate: (b) would not entail a lengthy
double haul of the mall; and (e) would be convenient aa a
distributing center to the eight postal statlona In the cen
tral, northern and eaatern parte of the city.
The above Is transmitted Tor your Informatkm, and the con

They are:

Sktnner, whose cellars yielded a
fabulous amount of liquor, and J.
C. Edea, who has assumed respon
sibility for all the booze confiscat
ed In a raid of the Rainier club.
These defendants have hired the
most able lawyers In the Northwest
to contest the right of Sheriff
Hodge to aeUa their stocks of

They will contend that thetr con
