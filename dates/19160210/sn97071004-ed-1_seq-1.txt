Mr. Wilson will confer with Chair

will be offered in the house. The

its provision for giving independence

VALUE OF STRAW FOR STOCK
Comfortable Stable and Good Bed Is
as Necessary fpr Animals as It ' ;
Is for Human Beings. '
All stock should be given a thick
bed of straw, leaves or sawdust A
comfortable stable and a good bed Is
as necessary for animals as it is for
human beings., If straw is wanted for
feed, forest leaves may , be used In
stead. Leaves contain a large percentage
of ash, and though not so valuable
as straw for litters, are very good.
Sawdust makes an excellent litter for
all stock. It not only adds - bulk,
which is of value, as thus the manure
Is divided, and is more easily and
evenly distributed, but it decays both
In the heap and In the soil, thus af
fording organic matter and ash to the
plant, while it retains all the valua
ble qualities of the manure.
Sawdust absorbs the urine, and
when this saturated sawdust Is
thrown out into a pile In the yard.
It will soon ferment, ahd it the ma

of such mast as hazelnuts and acorns.
Nearly 16 per cent of the birds' food
consists of Insects, the bulk of them
being grasshoppers. Among other
pests eaten by this species are the
Colorado potato beetle, encumber bee
tle. May beetle, cotton worm, army
worm, cutworm and chinch bug.
Tbe ruffed grouse, called "par
tridge" in the northwestern states and
pheasant in some other parts of Its
range, Is one of our most widely rang
ing game birds. It inhabits wooded
regions from Canada and Alaska south
to California, Colorado, Tennessee and
northern Georgia. It responds to pro
tection In a gratifying manner and
has proved to be well adapted to
propagation under artificial conditions.
On account of these qualities and its
desirability as a game species It la
a good subject for game farming.
Wild fruits, mast, and browse make
up the bulk of the vegetable food of
this bird. It is very fond of hazel
nuts, beechnuts, chestnuts and sfeorns,
and it eats practically all kinds of
wild berries and other fruits. Vari
ous weed seeds are also consumed.
More than 10 per cent of the food con
sists of Insects, about half of which
are destructive beetles.
GROWING SUGAR-BEET SEED
Outbreak of European War Hss Cut
Off Supply From Germany Parm
er Must Find New Source.
The greater part of the sugar-beet
seed sown each year tn the United
States has formerly been Imported':
from Europe, principally from Ger
many and Russia. Tho outbreak of i
the; present war has cut off this sup-
ply and now tbe problem Is to find
new sources for obtaining seed. The
growing of beet seed has been neg- .
lected in this country due to a de
creasing sugar content in beets from
native grown seed and also to the
scarcity of the hand labor necessary
in harvesting the crop. But now It is
up to tbe American farmer to grow
his own seed.
Although most of the factories have
sufficient seed on hand . for the
1916 sowing, yet a considerable acre
age has been set to seed beets. The
beets are set out early In spring In
rows four feet apart, the crown of
the beet being just level with the sur-
r face -of the ground. -
First a large thick cluster of leaves
grows op to about 18 Inches in height
and then the seed stalks appear.
Some beets send up but one large
branching seed stalk but the major
ity have several, four to ten, of the
tall branching stalks.
The beets are cultivated both ways
similar to corn until about tha 3rst
of July when the seed stalks get so
tall, in some cases reaching up five
and six feet, and bending over pre-"
vent cultivation. ;When viewed near
by a field of these plants does not

"If sweet potatoes are put In a dry

as Irish potatoes. Until they are dried
out the cave should be kept at 65 to
75 degrees; after that there should be
