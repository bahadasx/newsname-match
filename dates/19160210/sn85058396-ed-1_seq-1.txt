, Berlin, Feb. 10, by wireless to Sayville. The German
' government is about to issue a memorandum to neutral gov
ernments announcing that hereafter armed merchantmen be
longing to countries at war with Germany will be considered
and treated as warships.
Washington, Feb. 10. Germany and Austria, through
their embassies here, have notified the United States of their
intention to treat armed merchantmen as warships, after
March 1 . That date was fixed to give the entente allies time
to signify their intention toward the recent note of the United
States proposing the disarmament of all merchantmen.
The German government contends this measure is justi
fied by explicit instructions issued by the British admiralty to
merchantmen, a copy of which is said to have been obtained
ll by the German authorities. These instructions, it is under
stood here, were that the merchantmen should carry guns and
attack submarines on sight. It also stated these orders have
a counterpart in instructions issued by the governments of
other countries at war with Germany.

Berlin, Fob. 10, via London, 3 p. m.
The capture from the French of a
IfL large section of trench northwest of
) Vimy, in the Artois region, was an
, nouueed by German army headquar
ters today. A mine crater near Neu

of the German first line trenches.
The text of today's statement is as
follows
"Western theatre: Northwest of

Review of War Situation.
Infantry activities, apparently on
an important scale, are continuing
on the western war front with suc
cesses at some points for the Ger
mans and at others for the French.
Berlin announces the capture of a
large trench section northwest of
Vimy, together with the retaking of a
mine crater previously lost. The
German war office admits a reverse
south of the Somme near Becquln
court, where a foothold in German
first line trenches was secured by the
French.
French Claim Gains.
Paris claims gains in the Lens-Arras
sector, announcing that In hand
grenade engagements the Germans
were driven out of communicating
trenches. In this region the Germans
were only successful in securing a
footing in a mine crater which the
French had previously taken, accord
ing to the French war office.
Signs that a military operation of
Importance may be impending in the
Balkans are furnished by the Bul
garian government organ at Sofia
which asserts the right of Bulgaria to
invade Greece for an attack on the
French and British there.
Recent reports regarding the inten
tions of the Teutonic allies as to a
move on Saloniki have been contra
dictory. Dispatches announcing con
centration of troops and artillery
along the Greek border, however,
hf.ve been frequent.
Marked Activities In West,
On both eastern and western fronts
tho activity during the last few days
has been marked. Some movement
of note may he developing at the
northern end of tho Russian line
where the artillery play is reported
as heavy and continuous.
In the west the initiative at pres
ent seems to he with the Germans
who are hammering on the French
lines from time to time and making
an occasional gain.
Total Prussian losses in the war
are estimated by an Amsterdam news
paper's statistician as 2,377,378.
Bombardment of Smyrna on the
Asia Minor coast by a squadron of
French aeroplanes is reported from

HOW AMENITIES ARE
OBSERVED ON FRONT
Berlin, Feb. 9, via London, 4:50 p.
m. A new illustration of how the
amonlties of warfare are observed by
hostile airmen is given in a letter
fiom a German aviator on the west
ern front.
This aviator was a participant in
an aerial battle in which a British
aeroplane was shot down and one of
the aviators killed. The second was
uninjured in person, but in landing
his trousers had been irreparably
damaged.
The aviator thus afflicted, the Ger
man letter writer says, was so dis
tressed that the German aviator
mounted an aeroplane and dropped a
note into the British lines. An hour
later an English filer appeared, re
turning the call, and dropped a bun
dle containing new trousers for hit
compatriot.

MERCHANT SHIPS'
STATUS IN DOUBT
Appam Case Puts Different
Phase on Question U. S.
Not in Favor of Arming.
Washington, Feb. 10. The United
States recently proposed to all the
belligerents that the development of
submarine warfare had made it de
sirable for all to agree that merchant
ships should be absolutely unarmed
dismounting even the small caliber
guns which they have heretofore been
permitted to carry for defense
The memorandum went forward by
mall about two weeks ago. The pro
posal was based on the theory that
no merchant ships of the Germanic
powers and none of their commerce
destroyers except submarines were at
sea.
The Apparn case, however, which
disclosed a German merchant raider
at large, changed the situation ma
terially and the status of the Ameri
can proposal is in doubt.
The notification of the stand of the
Germanic powers, while delivered
orally, was 'formal and it was said
that because of difficulties of com
munication with the United States
formal notice in writing will be de
livered to the American embassies in
Vienna and Berlin.

Explanation.
Now York, Feb. 10. On February
7, Secretary of 'State Lansing made
the following statement in connection
with the Lusitanla case:
"All I wish to say Is that this gov
ernment has not Increased its de
mands in the Lusitania case, as set
forth in the notes of May 15, Juno 9
and July 1. I doubt very much if Dr
Zimmerman ever mnde such a state
ment, because he must know it is
utterly false."
This wns in reference to a statement
attributed to Dr Alfred Zimmerman.
Under-Secretary for foreign affairs, in,
an interview with The Associated
Press published on February 4, in
which he said.
"I do not understand America's
course. We had thought the submar

and all that when the United States
suddenly made Its new demands
which it is Impossible for us to ac
cept." Associated PresB Confirms Statement.
When Secretary Lansing's state

DANIELS DEFENDS
NAVAL PROGRAM
Secretary of Navy Advocates
Immediate Building Up of
Adequate Merchant
Marine.
NEED OF SHIPS URGENT
Thirty-three Dreadnoughts, 25
Battleships, Ten Armored
Cruisers, 175 Submarines
and Small Craft in Pro
portion Needed.
Washington, Feb. 10. Secretar
Daniels of the navy defended the ad
ministration naval increase program
and advocated the building up immedi
ately of an adequate merchant marine,
in a speech here today before a ses
sion of the Chamber of Commerce of
the United States devoted to discus
sion of national preparedness.
"We can no longer live unto our
selves," said Mr. Daniels "On our
farms we grow more than the republic
can consume We must, feed much of
the world. We have the right also to
have large share In clothing the world
and supplying people In every clime
with whatever Is manufactured in our
mills and factories. But how can we
fill our larger mission? What avail
teeming harvests and large production
in factories without adequate and
reasonable water transportation? The
securing of an adequate merchant
marine is a pressing problem and it
is so tied up with the enlarging and
strengthening of our navy that the
two cannot be wisely separated.
Big Navy Needed.
"The naval program offered by the
administration is a constructive, pro
gressive one and If built according to
the continuous five year program
the first continuing program ever pro
posed by an administration it will
give us by the year 1921 thirty-three
capital ships of .the -first line. ancL 2a.
battleships of the second line, with
ten armored cruisers, 10S destroyers,
175 submarines and small craft In
proportion."
Mr. Daniels declared himself to be
a disciple of Benjamin Franklin on
the question of preparedness. "This
philosopher statesman declared thnt
'there never was a good war nor a
bad peace.' but ho did more to prepare
for the Impending revolution than any
other man," he said.
"No man in the revolutionary per
iod could be preferred before him in
preparedness for defense. His
achievements for preparedness may
well be best studied by the people of
this day and generation."
Universal Training Advocated
Washington, Feb. 10. Universal
military training, restoration of the
American navy to second place and
creation of an advisory council of na
tional defense, composed of men re
presenting all forms of, national
strength were advocated by the Na
tional Defense Committee of tho
Chamber of Commerce of the United
States In a report today submitted to
the chamber.
"We believe that no place of na
tional defense," the report says,
"should be adopted which will permit,
due to the outbreak of war, any pro
fit arising out of the national danger
I to any one, and In case of the pressure
, of war being put upon us we may
i unitedly and universally accept sacri
fices, both of property and. person for
the one great national necessity."
The council of national defense,
composed of the president, the secre
taries of state, war, navy, commerce,
labor and treasury, chairmen of im
portant congressional committees,
ranking officers of the army and navy
and some civilians would perform
advisory and co-ordinating functions.

He expressed the conviction, they
said, that tho committee would bring

President Would Strengthen Guard
The president told them that while
he did not believe It feasible to sub

tinental army, he favored strengthen
ing the national guard.
The president urged speed and was
told that the committee will begin
framing the army bill next week and
that it would be ready for the house
in three weeks or a month.
Representative Kahn, Republican,
said after seeing the president that
there was no disposition on eltheer
side to inject politics into the bill.
It was argued, the president was in

be increased to approximately the
strength suggested by the war department.

Submarine Fires on Ship,
Wounds Man, Demands
Food and Takes It

Washington, Feb . 10 Secretary
Lansing announced today that he had
tent to the Austro-Hungarian govern
ment through Ambassador Penfield a
dispatch asking for an investigation
and an explanation of the attack by
an Austrian submarine on the Amer
ican tank steamer Petrolite.
rLhe secretary' said published state
ments that demands had been made
up on tho Vienna government were
"not true" but that It was within
the range of possibility that demands
of some sort might be made in the
future should the investigation and
explanation asked warrant them.
Tho secretary's dispatch called at
tention to affidavits from members
of the crew of the Petrolite and to
information from other sources to the
effect that the ship was stopped in
the Mediterranean near Alexandria,
by the submarine which fired upon
her and wounded one man in her en

Rear Admiral Homer R. Stanford,

mittee the surprising fact that not
one of the dry docks of the United

enough, but those on tho Atlantic
coast were Impossible. He urges the

the Petrolite refused. He thereupon
sent a boarding party on the boarding
and removed one American member
of her crew who was held as a hos
tage while the Austrlans took the
food they required from the Petro
Ute's stores.
Novel questions are involved in the
case. Warships under certain stress
may take food from merchantmen it
they give proper receipts or pay
ment, but it is realized that if sub
marines are to be permitted to do so,
every neutral ship might be made a
base for their operations. -

Carmalt, chief examiner of the Inter- JI'
state commerce commission, before ($.!
th senato sub-committee investigating fl1
the nomination of Louis D. Brandeis IMS
to tho supreme court bench today, jjjvj'
challenged the declaration of Clifford
Thorne, chairman of the Iowa railroad Dl!)
commission, that Mr. Brandeis had J ft!
concealed from him tho attitude he fin
would take in arguing the eastern j',i
freight rato case before the commit-
tee. J ;
Yesterday Mr. Thorne, who was as- j r
soclated with Mr. Brandeis in the trial
of the rato case for shippers and the v i
commission, declared he was "dumb- ai'
founded" when Brandeis, at the out- litt
set of his closing argument, conceded jiK
to the contention of the railroads that k.
the eastern freight returns were In- l
adequate for the prosperity of tho j
roads and the best interests of the
public. t jl ,
"There is one incldent'tflrmly fixed ll
in my mind," said Mr. Carmalt, "re- j!
garding a conversation which Mr. i
Thorne had with me on the second If ;
day of the argument in the rate case. 8!
Mr. Thorne, I understand, stated that J
wrhen the commission fixed the .allot- 2ji
ment of time for attorneys to argue j
the case, he had asked the privilege hl
of being permitted to follow counsel jll-
for the shippers instead 'of opening lift;
the argument. jj?j,
"Mr. Thorne asked me what Mr. Ill
Brandeis' position would be in the R
argument. There was no doubt in my
mind what Mr. Brandeis' position
would be. I had discussed with him jb
and he had told me There certain- IBj
ly was no disposition to conceal it B
from Mr. Thorne. I am confident that Hi
I told Mr. Thorne that Mr. Brandeis 2f
would take the position that tho net ffij
operating income of the carriers was SI
not adequate with special stress on K
the Central Freight Associatloa terrl-
tory. Further I said he would take m
the position that the methods pursued ' R
by the carriers to obtain greater reve- (if
n'ues through a horizontal five per SjJjf
cent increase were not the proper fj
ones. 5JR
"I am quite clear that It was as the flu
result of this conversation that Mr. I
Thorne wrote Mr. Brandeis a note jj
asking about a change in the allott- IjE

impression because Mr. Thorne knew Wk
the attitude Mr. Brandeis would take gjr
that Mr. Brandeis got the conception fiffi

Responding to further questions by U
