"About 8 o'clock the other night,"
x Thompson says, "a tall, rangy ruralite
entered the lobby of the hotel
, and approached the desk. After I
;
had fixed him up with a room he asked
me if I would take care of some
money for him. I told him I would
be glad to put it in the safe. He
fished down in his trouser's pocket
and produced a two-dollar bill.
i " 'Just put that away,; he said. 'I
. am going out for a little while and I
don't want to take any chances with
these city slickers.'
"I kept my face straight and assured
him it'would be safe on his re^
turn. He started to leave and then
turned around and asked me how
% late we kept open.
~ " 'Oh, I'll be here when you get
" back,' I told him. . ,
" 'Well, I don't know,' he replied.
'I calculate I'll be pretty late. Most
10 o'clock, likely.'
"I assured him I would be on deck,
but he did not seem satisfied. After
pondering a few minutes he asked:"
" 'Could I see Mr. Laclede?"
"That had me going for a few minutes,
but when I recovered I told him
Mr. Laclede had gone to bed."

Shoppers in the business section

on an automobile ride through the '
city. It was the buck that has been
living with the cattle in Frank
Weyandts farm in Frankstown township
for some time.

St. Matthews Woman "Queers" Game
of Eye "Doctor."
St. Matthews, Feb. 7.?Four men,
styling themselves "Dr.," and passing
off as eye specialists, came here Sat- ,
urday and came near getting into
trouble. - These "specialists," it
seems, carry a pretentious looking
case. The case is filled with "specs"
galore, all "solid gold." The "doctors"
are all gentlemen of faultless
spiel and carry an important and
learned look. They talk in technical
terms and talk fast, too. Their habit
seems to be to go casually into the
work of making a thorough examination
of the eye simply to see if
anything should be really needed^
guided more by patriotic philanthropy
than a mere desire to sell
goods. During the progress of the
examination a terrible defect appears
in one eye and all at once the victim
sees double. That is a sure sign that
somebody is going blind, and they <
have a pair of glasses ground for
just such a case.
They worked their game here in
several places; but one lady discovered
after she had parted with her
cash that it was not Aer eye that had
^ Al? l
made her see aouDie dux tne ieus
that she had tried. Further, she
found upon using the acid test that
the "solid gold" frames fairly fumed
of brass. She also learned that immediately
upon making the sale the
"doctor^" had secured a car of good
speed and were shaking the dust of
this place from their feet. A warrant
was sworn out and the sheriff
put in pursuit. They were discovered
in Columbia late , Saturdav night,
and when they were advised that they
could pay up or ride back in the :
sheriff's new car and try their hand
at roadbuilding they paid up, and
Said in addition by way pf compensa- 1
tion for the trouble of tie aggrieved '
one, that they knew a member of her
family well, and had they known
then who she was they would never !
have thought of playing her such a
trick. . - INVITE

Smith and Byrnes Urge President to
Inclnde Capital City in Tour.
?? . {
Washington, Feb. 7.?Senator E. c
D. Smith and Congressman Byrnes ~
today called at the white house and
strongly urged the president to visit
South Carolina on his trip to the
!i
South. They reminded the president
that the people of Columbia were
really his people and would not be *
satisfied to have him visit other parts
of the South and leave Columbia out. J
Upon this showing the president said
?
that he would give the matter serious j
consideration and that he greatly ap-; .
predated the invitation which had i
i a
been extended him. j
There is little doubt now that a ^
programme for this Southern trip
will be agreed upon within the next
few days, everything heretofore having
been of a tentatve nature.
The president is understood to
have said regarding his recent West.

ern trip that he was greatly satisfied)^
^*ith it and felt that a long step had ^
been taken to put his preparedness .

Ottawa, February 4.?The historic
.nadian parliament building was deroyed
last night by a fire declared
[officially to have been cause by the
plosion of a gas bomb or infernal
achine. Two women, guests of the
ife 01 Speaker Sevigny, were overme
by smoke and perished. Seval
policemen and firemen were
tried under debris when one end
the building collapsed. The numr
of persons taken to hospitals had
>t been determined earlv this morn
g. Frederick F. Pardee, chief Libal
whip, and William S. Loggie, a
ember of parliament from New
uinswick, are missing and it is fearl
they have lost their lives.
It has been established that the
st burst of flame in the reading
om of the house of commons was
eceded by at least one explosion,
id probably by two. The force of
e concussion was so severe that
srsons standing some distance away
*re hurled to the floor. A rigid instigation
to determine the cause of
e fire already has been taken by
e Dominion authorities.
Sir Robert Borden, the Canadian
emier, who was in the building, es,ped
safely, but Martin Burrell,
inister of agriculture, was severely
irned about the head, and Dr. Michil
Clark, member for Red Deer,
as burned aboi^t the hands. Many
the legislators who were in the
lilding experienced great\ difficulty

AUTHORIZES $75 000 LOAN.
f
!5,000 for Military Equipment and
$50,000 for Prohibition.
t ?
Columbia, Feb. 4.?There was
mething doing today on the house
le. Whether there is anything or
rt in the suggestion, the statement
is openly made by Mr. Bingham, of
ken, and by Mr. Smith, of Collel,
that there was an apparent comlation
between the enthusiastic
litarists and prohibitionists, the
e to get authority for $25,00(Twith
tiich, if necessary, to pay for lost
uipment, and the other to place in
3 hands of the governor authority
expend as much as $50,000, if so
ich be necessary, for the enforcemt
of the prohibition law.
The house refused to make a di:t
appropriation of $25,000 with
lich to pay for the lost equipment,
day, whether there should be anying
in the suggestion of combinan
or not, it voted authority for the
>ney to be borrowed with which to
y this charge, if it could not otherse
be arranged; and then the house
ted authorization of the $50,000
id for the enforcement of tfie pro)ition
law.
The two items were voted in the
ipe of authority to borrow and not
ect appropriations to be added to
3 sum total of the appropriation
1. The item for the relief of the
litary was passed by a vote of sixfour
to thirty, and the authority
r the borrowing of $50,000 for the
forcement of the prohibition law
s adopted by a vote of fifty-three
thirty-five.
The fight came up on these amendnts
of the appropriation bill, and

GOVERNOR URGES ACTION.
ASKS ASSEMBLY TO ACT ON
STATE-WIDE BILLS.
Special Message Bequests Passage of
Six Important Administra
uvsu
Columbia, Feb. 8.?Gov. Manning
in a special message urged upon the
legislature tonight immediate action
upon six pending measures: That
enacting the Torrens systems of land
title registration, one -creating a
scheme of rural credits, the TooleLaGrone
bill for the teaching of agriculture
in the common schools, the
McCullough bill raising the child labor
age limit to 14 years, the BuckMills-Johnstone
bill providing for a
workmen's compensation plan and
the Nicholson bill for the certification
of teachers by a State board.
"These measures are in my judgment
of State-wide importance," the
governor said, "and I feel that the
interests of the people demand the
enactment of these bills into law.
Your desire and ability to serve your
State are unquestioned. I, therefore,
urge again, with earnestness and sincerity,
that active efforts be made to
enact these laws. The people are
pleading for them and should have
them. Let me again urge upon you
the necessity for definite action on
these most important State-wide
measures."
r Torrens Land Registration.
The special message is as ionows:
''Permit me respectfully to call
your attention to the importance of
pressing the consideration of certain
measures on your calendars, which I
deem of importance to the great body
of our citizens whom you and I represent.
# "My reason for this message is
that we are approaching the closing
days .of the session and I earnestly
desire that these matters should not
be overlooked.
"There have been meetings of citizens
in many localities throughout
the State, calling on the legislature
to adopt the Torrens system of land
registration and enact the same into
law. This is a necessary prerequisite
to a system of rural credits. It
will reduce expenses in borrowing
money on land; it gives the State's
warrant to title, and puts an end to
litigation on land titles. Such an act
would be a boon to the State, and I
earnestly urge its adoption.
"Forty-three per cent, of our white
j farmers are tenants. The dream of
the South Carolina patriot is to see
these tenants become the owners of
their homes and farms. If we are to
progress, we must help these tenants
to help themselves in their ambition
to become home owners; and we must
make this possible by adopting measures
hitherto untried, even if this
may seem radical.. The result is important.
I deem it of .the utmost
importance to take the steps necessary
to bring it about.
"Let us not adjourn this session
until these two measures are made
into laws. Then our vision for future
development will be turned into
a reality and our rural population
will find full scope for their soaring
and elevating ambitions, to find realization
in a people happy in the prospect
of future comfort, contentedness
and happiness.
Agriculture in the Schools.
"I earnestly urge upon you the desirability
of enacting into law the
Toole and LaGrone bill, providing
for the teaching of agriculture in the
common schools. Agriculture is the
basis of our material prosperity. The
common school is the keystone of our
educational system. Provide for the
[ teaching of agriculture in the common
school, so that agricultural education
will reach those who cannot
get an agricultural course and an
enlightened prosperity is the result
among this large body of our citizens.
"The McCulIough bill, which province
fnr thp rm'sine of the child la
bor age limit to 14 years, is of great
importance and should be speedily
enacted. The very wording of this
bill is the greatest argument in favor
of its passage. The longer the child
is kept in school the greater his efficiency
when he begins work.
"The workmen's compensation
bills introduced by Senator Buck and
Representatives .Mills and Johnstone
have been carefully worked out and
in my judgment win meet conditional
existing in South Carolina. There is
nothing in the act that can injure the
honest employer or employee: it is a
protection to both; it is fair and just
to all parties, and the sooner it becomes
a law the sooner will our court
dockets be cleared, and kept clear, of
personal damage suits; and justice

WOMAN SENATOR SPEAKS.
~
Helen Ring Robinson Talks on Votes
for Women.
Columbia, Feb. 7.?.Mrs. Helen
Ring Robinson, who is a member of
the State senate, addressed the people
of Columbia tonight under the
auspices of the Equal Suffrage
League of South Carolina on "Votes
for Women." Senator Robinson is a
\t ><
pleasing speaker and she presented
the cause for women in an able and
convincing manner. Mrs. Robinson
was a member of the Ford Pacification
party to which Lieutenant Governor
Andrew J. Bethea, of this
State, belonded. Several members
of the general assembly who were in
the city attended the lecture and ' Vv#f?
not only heard a woman legislator
speak, but saw just exactly what
equal suffrage would mean.
Senator Robinson will go from here
to Charleston, where she will make ||
an address on equal suffrage. She ."i
has speaking engagements at several
points in the Southern States.
While in Columbia Senator Robinson
was the guest of the members of |
the local suffrage league and met jf
many of the leading women of the
city. She made many friends while
here. ^
The End of Old "3,824."

masters faithfully twenty-eight years j
and taking an active and very important
part in the business and commercial
life of 150 miles of terri-'
jtory, "Old 3824" has been condemned
to spend the balance of her days '
in the society of other "has-beens."
| "Old 3824," as she is familiarly
| known to the hundreds of people in .
; this section who have known her-for / ^
|many years, is the second oldest-en- -'M
'gine on the Marion and Kingville di- V >.
vision of the Southern railroad and
; for the past twenty-eight years has |f
daily run into York. Orders have re- :4||
cently been sent forth from the railway
officials that "Old 3824" is to be,~
sent to the Rock Hill railroad yards * ^
land into the scrap heap. But before ' Jm
the faithful old iron horse takes the '"'gjl
place of honor among the denizens of '/3|
the junk pile, all her brass trimmings -4
'and_ other parts that can be used will ' -%M
, be stripped from her ard placed upon
some other engine of the road, and ;> J|
she will, therefore, still be of some
service to the owners. But the old
'engine as an engine has made her J
i last run along the crooked old track, ,^!?
jand scores of boys and girls yester!
day, grown up to manhood and wo- /
'manhood while "Old 3824 has been ' ^
on the rails, and who are fond of the
old engine, have seen her coming ^
snorting and puffing up to the little
jdepot here for the last time.
No. 3824 was one of the first coalj
burning engines placed in service on
jthe old Charleston, Columbia and
j Cincinnati roalroad after the track
|was laid to Yorkville in 1888. At >
the time 'these four locomotives were
considered the last word in passen- ^
ger engines. They were numbered
j consecutively from 1 to 4, although
, the numbers have since been changied
to conform to the numbers of 4-^
| other engines owned by the South- ||
jern. On the panel of each cab jvas 4||
j painted the name of a town along the
line. One of them bore the name |
("Yorkville." Another, the "Lancas- /
jter," was the first coal-burning loco- r|
| motive ever run to Yorkville. This ?S
(was in October, 1S88, when tne en-' .
igine was in charge of Engineer. Mid
Manning and his son.. What name
"Old 3824" bore has been forgotten* rM
The four engines were built by the
! Hinckley Locomotive company, a
Ifirm whose products have lived long- -M
er than it did. Only one of the original
engines will remain in active
! service now since the decree that
"Old 3824" shall run no more. The
survivor is No. 3826, which is occas- ^
ionally used in extra passenger service
between Columbia and Charlotte
and Columbia and York. It is ,
considered too light for hauling the
[heavy cars that have taKen tne piace
| of those ih use when it, like "Old^
i 3824," was considered "some engine,"
and it will doubtless only be a
short time until it will follow "Old
3824" to the place where all wornout
engines go, and then will have
passed the last veteran of many years
of faithful service on the Three C's.
