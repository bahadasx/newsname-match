REPUBLICANS 11
ON WILWS ARMY
Tell President that They Be
lieve in Strengthening
Nation's Guard.
(By Associated Pre*s)
WASHINGTON Feb. 10.?President
Wilson' was told flatly today by Repub
licans of the House military committee
that they believed the commlttoe was
practically unanimously apposed to the
continental army plWeaftHStered by the
war department. l&BPVQtf they be
lieved the committee .favored the
strengthening ot the National Guard
and empowering the President to draft
it into the regular army In time of
war.
The Republicans left the White
house with the' impression that, the
President still believed the continental)
army plan' the best so far devised.'
He showed no disposition, they1 said,
to attempt to force adoption of any par
ticular plan,^but expressed conviction
that the committee will bring out a-tilll'
for an adequate army reserve.
The President told them that -while
he did not believe dt feasible to sub
stitute the National 'Guard for the con
tinental army, 'be favored strengthen?
ing the National Guard. . '! "
Under the Constitution the President
contended the guard is distinctly a
state force. The Republicans contend-,
ed that this could be overcome,by,a
law allowing.' the President to draft
the organizatlon in time, of war.'; t
