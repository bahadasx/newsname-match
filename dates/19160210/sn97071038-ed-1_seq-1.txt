FARMERS MAY BUILD
WHEAT ELEVATOR
At the annual meeting of the Mor
row County Farmers' Union in this
city last week, the plan for con
structing a wheat elevator in Hepp
ner this year, was discussed with ser
iousness. The farmer is compelled to pay
12 Vt cents for sacks at the present
time and he looks to the future with
apprehension for as harvest time
draws near, he knows that the price
of grain bags invariably goes higher.
The Union has a committee working
on the elevator plan and they will
report the success of their investiga
tions at a later date.
A committee was also appointed
to take care of the arrangements for
the annual picnic. 'Since they have
received an invitation to hold their
picnic in Heppner this year, and
since the two former affairs were
held in Lexington and lone respect
ively, it is likely that Heppner will
be host this time.
Owing to adverst weather condi
tions the annual meeting was not as
well attended as former meetings.
Heavy Snow Crushes Roof.
The heavy weight of melting snow
on the roof of Vaughn & Sons' ware
house at the rear of the store caused
the top of that building to cave in
Monday morning. Some of the snow
had been removed prevlosuly but the
structure of the building did not
stand up under the remaining pres
sure. According to John Vaughn,
very little damage was caused to au
tomobiles and other machinery
Btored in the warehouse.
Wilson E. Brock, well known in
this city, has been elected president
of the Pendleton Commercial Asso
ciation for the ensuing year. The

progressive business men in that city
and Mr. Brock succeeds J. V. Tall
nian, for the past three years at the
head of the Association.
John Vaughn returned home Sun
day evening from a business trip to
Portland.

RESCUE PARTY RETURNS
WITH "DAD" CARPENTER
A rescue party consisting of
Charles Ayers and W. P. Leatherman
returned to Heppner yesterday' from
the mountains of upper Willow creek
with "Dad" Carpenter, the well
known old miner, who has been
spending the winter on the Frank
Bell place cutting wood. Mr. Cav
penter is an old man, being past
eighty years of use and it was feared
that he might have been cut oft with
out provisions on account of the deep
snow. For that reason, Judge Pat
terson sent the rescue party to his
aid and after two days of tramping,
tlu) boys found the old man in his
cabin, with plenty of grub and en
joying life. He expects to return to
the mouutans as soon as the weather
will permit. Snow has been about
four feet deep on upper Willow creek
according to Mr. Carpenter.
During the recent congestion of
traffic on the main line of the O.-W.
R. & N. Co., and when it was impos
sible to get freight trains through,
the passenger trains were used in
moving cars of hay and other feed so
necessary for the prevention of
starving stock.
FOREST RANGERS TO
FEED GAME AND BIRDS
The District Forester at Portland,
Oregon, has issued a circular letter
to all Forest officers, urging them to
feed game and birds in their respec
tive localities during storm periods.
The National Forest appropriation
is limited to the care of fish and
game supplied to stock the Forests
or the waters therein, and cannot be
used for the purchase of food for
game and birds. However, the mat
ter is a most worthy one, especially
during this year of exceptional
storms, and each forest officer is
urged not only to use his best efforts
to furnish game animals and game
and song birds with something in the
way of food but is asked to appeal to
ranchers and stockmen generally In
his vicinity to do their part In aiding
the work.
Burton H. Peck, well known dry
land agriculturist, was in Heppner
Wednesday from his Sagenhurst
farm.

NELLIE RAY HOWELL
Nellie Ray Howell, wife of John
Howell, died at her home in Hard
man, Oregon, January 31, 1916.
On the beautiful plains of western
Illinois, during the anniversary of
our national Independence, (1876),
on the 27th day of May, when Nature
smiled in great profusion and sweet
ness, the subject of our sketch was
born. This babe seemed to absorb
the sweetness of her surroundings,
developing into a charming girl, a
beautiful woman, a true, patient wife
and a loving mother.
It seems very hard for the family
and the community to part with this
dear woman who went about admin
istering deeds of kindness merely for
the good they would do not for pomp
or praise.
With her parents, Mr. and Mrs. T.
J. Merrill, she came to Oregon In
1882 and located in what is now
Morrow county on November 4,
1S84. She was married to John
Howell on August 26, 1896 and to
this union were born seven children.
They are Clarence, Opal. Pearl, Eu
dora, Thomas, Cleve Winton and
Blanche Ora, all of whom survive
and are at home to comfort the grief
stricken father who has performed
the duties of husband and father so
faithfully. Besides these she leaves
a father and mother, Mr. and Mrs. T.
J. Merrill, of Monument, four broth
ers, E. Jay Merrill of Hardman,
Mark C, Harvey H. and Alonzo T.
of Monument, and two sisters, Mrs.
M. E. Devore and Mrs. H. A. Emery
of Hardman.
Regardless of the Inclemency of
the weather, a host of friends laid
her to rest in the I. 0. 0. F. ceme
tery. Spirit, thy labor is o'er,
Thy term of probation is run,
Thy steps are now bound for the un
trodden shore
And the race of Immortals has begun

City Council Meets.
The city council of Heppner held
their regular meeting in the city hall
on Monday evening with Mayor Not
son presiding. The regular bills for
the previous month were audited and
ordered paid. Recorder Williams
made the second reading on the or
dinance pertaining to the licensing
of pool halls and also the ordinance
relating to the selling of intoxicating
liquor in this city. Owing to the
prevalence of rabies in animals in
and near this town, the city fathers
deemed it advisable to take every
precaution to prevent the spread of
tills dread disease. In order to bet
ter cone with the situation, dogs will
probably be muzzled and all stray
and unlicensed canines will be done
away with.
Christian ('lunch Xotes.
Subject next Sunday morning will
be: 'The Triumphant Church." Eve
nine theme: "Where is God?"
The annual election and business
meeting will be held Friday evening

FOREIGN DEBATORS WILL
CLASH AT THIS PLACE
The high school debating teams of
Echo and Condon have decided to
meet or. neutral ground and have
picked this city as the place and Sat
urday, Feb. 19, as the time. This
is according to advice received by
local school authorities from Prof.
W. W. Green, head of the Echo
schools.. Prof. Green has asked that
local men be asked to serve as Judges
and this has been done. The debate
will be held in the high school audi
torium. The question is: "Resolved,
that the United States should adopt
the essential features of the Swiss
system of military training and ser
vice." Echo will uphold the affirma
tive. Mrs, LoiiKbruke Dies at Lewlston.
Word has been received by S. E.
Notson of this city of the death of
Mrs. Elijah Hull Longbrake at her
home in Lewiston, Idaho, last Sat
urday afternoon. Mrs. Longbrake
had been ill for several days and
death was caused from hemorrhage
of the lungs. Mrs. Longbrake was
a resident of Heppner a few years
ago, when her husband, Rev. Elijah
Hull Longbrake was pastor of the
Federated church. She is survived
by the husband and one daughter.
Ladies Did Well.
The Sisterhood of the Christian
church realized about $50 from the
dinner which they served last Fri
day evening. Many pies and cakes
left over were disposed of at a win
dow sale the following day.
COMMERCIAL CLUB
ERY AND
The membership meeting of the
Heppner Commercial Club which was
held in the Palace hotel grill on
Tuesday evening was participated in
by probably the largest gathering of
representative business men that has
ever attended a club meeting. Presi
dent J. L. Wilkins presided over the
events of the evening and after an
excellent chicken dinner had been
disposed of, four propositions were
taken up and discussed.
Financing the county fair was the
first question introduced, which was
at once taken up by County School
Superintendent S. E. Notson. Mr.
Notson spoke of the value of the fair
to the entire county and especially
of the educational and Industrial
benefits. The county fair serves as
an extension to the schools and since
this county Is spending $60,000 per
year for schools, the superintendent
was of the opinion that it would not
be amiss to do the work thoroughly
and expend more money in making a
better fair. He was followed by W.
W. Smead, secretary of the Fair
Board, who explained the Indebted
ness of the fair board, the amount re
quired to pay off the indebtedness
and to continue a successful fair. He
as well as Mr. Notson, explained the
method which the board has under
consideration for financing the fair,
which they consider equitable and
fair. A half mill tax levied for two
years will give Morrow county a good
fair and pull the board out of debt
say these men and they gave the fig
ures to back up their assertions. C.
E. Woodson spoke in favor of the
tax issue but believes before the
question is put up to the voters that
a campaign of education on the sub
ject should be undertaken which will
make the Issue carry with the entire
people by a good majority. The idea
is to get petitions circulated in suf
ficient time to have the half mill tax
issue placed on the May primary bal
lot. OF ACTIVITY IN 1
A new band organization has been
launched at lone and before very
long there should be "music in the
air" hereabouts. Paul G. Balsiger
is president of the new organization,
Jesse Dobyns, secretary-treasurer, E.
J. Brlstow, manager and Vawter
Crawford, leader. The band is made
up of several old players and a num
ber of new fellows who have had
some tutalage, and it is the intention
to work up a creditable musical or
ganization that . will be prepared to
furnish entertainment for all oc
casions requiring the services of a
band. On cornets there will be
Jesse Dobyns, John Hosner, Vawter
Crawford, Earl Blake; clarinet, C.
Schrivner; altos, Thomas Griffiths,
Chas. Cochran, Wayne Schrivner,
Earl Cronk; tenors, Joseph Lowell,
Elisha Sperry, Frank Stoops; bari
tone, P. G. Balsiger; tuba, E. J. Brls
tow; drums, Chas. Chick.
W. F. Burger, who has been en
gaged in the harness business at this
place for several years, has made an
assignment for the benefit of his
creditors, being unable to realize
sufficiently on his collections to keep
ahead of his obligations to outside
houses. Sorry to note that Mr. Bur
ger has met with this business re
verse. He is a fine young man and
deserved to prosper. Mr. Burger
contemplates leaving Ion'e soon for
his former home in Wisconsin. His
place of business here is closed for
the present, being in charge of R. L.
Sabin, of Portland, who will try to
dispose of the business as it stands,
and have it opened up again.
High water did considerable dam
age to the farms of T. B. Buffington
and Frank Akers just above lone.
The piling up of the ice from Rhea
creek caused quite a serious overflow
at this point and the water did no
small amount of damage cutting
through the fields. At the farms of
Alex Lindsay and Gus Wilcox there
was a big overflow also and consider
able damage reported. The high wa
ter from Rhea creek did the work
at this point, and rushed across the
flat without reference to the Willow
creek channel. It is early yet to as
certain the extent of damage done.
Dr. C. C. Chick, after having been
forced to remain in Portland for a
week, where he enjoyed some real
weather, managed to get home on
Monday. He was called to the city
because of the severe Illness of his
father. The Doctor is fully convinced
that all of the bad weather does not
settle about the Eastern Oregon
country, and he can testify to the
fact that Portland can put up about
the worst bunch of that article that
is to be found anywhere around this
part of the mortal vineyard.
C. E. Shaver is preparing to begin
work on the new well out at the A.
B. Grover farm just as soon as the
weather settles. Charlie has been
quite successful at putting down
deep wells, an example of his good
work being the well completed late
In the fall for Jere Barlow. We trust
he will be able to do as well for Mr,
1 Grover.
ADDS MANY NEW
ENDORSES CREAM
HER
The result of the campaign by the
membership committee was 49 new
members and this number has been
materially increased since Tuesday
T. J. Mahoney, as chairman of the
membership committee spoke at
some length on the value of main
taining a commercial organization,
and in order to make that organiza
tion a success, much depends upon
membership. "A membership in the
Commercial Club is a good invest
ment,' said Mr. Mahoney. And he
advised business men to spend less
money east of the Rockies for cal
endars, key rings, pocket books, and
other forms of novelty advertising
and invest more money in the local
commercial club. His speech was
well received.
The Willow-Ditch creek project
was discussed by C. A. Minor and
Willard Herren. It is likely that work
will start at an early date on the
new ditch which will carry water
from Ditch creek into Willow creek
The proposition has now been in
dorsed by both the Commercial Club
and the Morrow County Rod & Gun
Club and lower creek farmers are
greatly interested in the project, ac
gording to Mr. Minor.
The proposed creamery which Ira
M. Morgan, a practical creamery man
wished to establish In this city, re
ceived the enrorsement of the club
and the new industry 1b practically
assured for this place. Under Mr.
Morgan's supervision the creamery
machinery will be installed and the
entire cost will not exceed $1500.
Ths is considered a very modest be
ginning, but Mr. Morgan has hopes
of building up the business as the
field is developed.
The dinner was made the more
enjoyable with music which was fur
nished to the club free of charge by
Redifer's orchestra.
After a little round of discussion
on the political situation, the club
adjourned.
EGG CITY ID ViGINITY
V. F, Palmateer was up from Mor
gan on Tuesday and says that the
big snow in his section is going off
slowly, and the moisture is all sink
ing into the ground. The Chinook hit
that section a little later than it did
around lone. Mr. Palmateer leaves
this week for a short visit with his
people residing in Clackamas county
Willow creek at this point was
caused to roar considerably on Mon
day and Tuesday from the excess of
water coming down from above. It
did not overflow, however, and the
slackening up of the chinook now in
sures us that we shall experience no
danger from flood waters.
Frank and Adrian Engelman re
turned from Athena, Ore., on Mon
day. They were called to that place
early last week by the severe illness
of their mother, Mrs. Melinda King.
Mrs. King was called to her long
rest at her home there after an ill
ness of long duration. She was for
merly a resident of this county
where she was well known and high
ly respected.
Millard Davis and brothers were
in town Tuesday from the Chas. Da
vis farm Tuesday. They have been
snowed in for the past three
weeks and were somewhat glad to
see a break come in the stormy
weather. They report their brother
Charles still quite sick and unable to
get out of the house.
Bert Mason returned on Sunday
evening from a stay of ten days at
Hot Lake Sanatorium. He be
stirred himself as soon as the rail
road service was re-established, feel
ing that it would be better for him to
be on this side of the mountains un
der present unsettled weather con
ditions. The stay at the Lake helped
him and he is largely relieved of his
ailments.
No severe stock loss has been re
ported but there were a few who
have run out of feed, and the pro
longing of the severe winter would
mean to them the entire loss of their
livestock. When we stop to consider
there is but little excuse on the part
of many of our farmers for not hav
ing abundant feed for their stock
There is never a season so bad in
this country that plenty of rye hay
cannot be produced, and the farmer
that exercises a little forthought and
prudence, will see to it that he raises
enough of this fodder to keep his
stock from perishing; and he should
take this precaution, no matter what
the prospects are for open winter
weather. To those who were eaten
out by grasshoppers and hailed out
by the early summer storms there
can be expressed nothing but words
of commiseration. These were in
deed unfortunate and have had to go
up against conditions over which
they had no control. A comparative
ly small number were effected in this
manner, however, and this winter of
1915-16 should be a lesson to our
farmers that they prepare plenty of
good feed for their livestock to carry
them through, no matter what kind
of weather conditions prevail, or
how long they last.

W. Pearl LeTrace.
The staff is receiving some excell
ent material for the annual. If the
good work is kept up, they will be
able to put out a very good annual.
That is their ambition, to make the
annual bigger and better than ever.
Loren Mikesell, the joke editor of
the annual, has contrived a plan to
get material for his department. He
has placed a joke-box on the desk
in the auditorium. Students know
ing or bearing a joke may put it iu
the box.
We are sorry to hear that one of
our students, Thomas Hughes, is
very ill.
The girl's basket ball team will
play the lone girls' team Saturday
evening, weather permitting.
Sophomore Party.
A very delightful party was given
by the Sophomores last Friday eve
ning. The Invitations were in the
form of subpoenas. A kangaroo
court was the feature of the eve
ning. Henry Peterson was given his nat
uralization papers. The "Swede"
now holds his head high, having re
ceived such important papers.
The case of Miss Loa Brlggs, plain
tiff, and Prof. J. W. Motley, defend
ant, was one of considerable interest.
A synopsis of the case is some
thing like this: Miss Brlggs had
fallen and broken her arm on the
rough board walk that Mr. Motley
had built up to the old schoolhouse.
Her witnesses were Florence Rals
ton, Clarence Scrivner and Oma Ben
nett. Her attorney was Garnet Bar
ratt. Vawter Crawford was Mr. Mot
ley's attorney. Miss Brlggs was su
ing for $25,000 damages. Dr. Pepp.
(Norton Winnard), the celebrated
African doctor, set her arm. Just
before the jurors left to decide the
case, Dr. Pepp put in his doctor bill,
which was $25,000 (quite a reason
able sum).
The jurors decided the case thus:
That Miss Brlggs should receive
nothing, and that she should marry
the doctor to pay the doctor s bill.
Those present were Earl Gordon,
Isabel Wilson, Norma Frederick,

SHEEPMEN WILL RECEIVE
BENEFIT OF FORECASTS
According to advice received from
W. W. Cryder, Forest Supervisor, an
arrangement has been made between
the Forest Service and the U. S.
Weather Bureau whereby a special
forecast of severe storms or cold
weather in the months of March,
April and May will be furnished the
Supervisor. Many losses have been
caused to lambs and freshly shorn
sheep through the effects of severe
storms in the spring and this could
have been avoided had the stockmen
known in advance of the coming un
favorable weather coudition. After
being telegraphed of the forecast by
the Weather Bureau, Supervisor Cry
der will immediately distribute It to
the following men: T. J. Mahoney,
Heppner; S. B. Barker, Condon; Dan
P. Smythe, Arlington; R. B. Stan
field, Echo, and L. C. Scharpf, Pilot
Rock.
Heppner Mining Company Elects.
The Heppner Mining Company
held their annual meeting in this
city Tuesday at the office of Sam E.
VanVactor. Dan B. Stalter was re
elected president and gjneral mana
ger and Osmin Hager was elected
secretary to succeed Edgar B. Ayers.
Mr. Hager was formerly vice presi
dent and E. S. Duran of Lexiugton,
was elected to this office to succeed
Mr. Hager. Mr. Stalter will return
to the Mayflower mine in the Green
horn mountains about the middle of
April.
PREDICT HIGHER
PRICES OR O S
The prediction of U. S. Govern
ment officials that the hog market of
the country was sure to show signs
of strength at an early date has come
true. Hogs are now bringing $7.75
in the Puget Sound market and it is
generally conceded that shipments
are so limited that it will be neces
sary in another forty or sixty days to
begin shipping from Missouri River
points. Freight and shrinkage will
add about $1.20 to the price with the
result that it is predicted the price
will be $9.00 or even more by early
spring. The Government is going
to every length to induce the grow
ers to renew their activities and
there is every indication that they
a-e taking kindly to the advice. The
Government has always contended
that it is a serious mistake for grow
ers to even temporarily abandon the
raising of hogs notwithstanding that
wheat prices were soaring and hogs
were not bringing the prices they
should. This condition the Govern
ment contended was only temporary
and that it would be only a short
time when wheat would go down in
price and hogs would go up. This
prediction Is certainly coming true
as to the advance in hog prices and
students of market conditions are
sure that the wheat prices are liable
to take a slump almost any time.
War alone, it is contended is largely
responsible for the high grain prices.
But even Europe has stopped buying
our wheat and is depending on its
own crops and those that can be pur
chased from nearby countries. It is
an admitted fact that Russia has so
much wheat on hand that she does
not know what to do with it. Once
the Allies succeed in coming to her
rescue and releasing this wheat
American prices are sure to go back
to normal or even below normal.
And with the close of the war or
even earlier, if they can get it, Eu
ropean countries will be very anxious
to get our pork. There is a pork
famine in Europe today and it will
be even greater for a time, at least,
after the war comes to a close. But
even now, leaving European de
mands out of consideration, the
American hog market is getting in
fine shape and growers are assured
of fine prices for the future.
WASH-CUTS ON BRANCH
LINE HOLDS UP TRAIN
The local train was unable to make
its regular run down the line today
on account of wash-outs which have
occurred. One bridge near Lexing
ton and another near Morgan have
been taken out by the high water.
Some damage to orchards near lone
has been caused by the present high
water overflowing its banks and in
many places the creek has taken its
course off through the fields. In
east Heppner residents have met
with some inconveniences on account
of the mill race, which is leaking
badly in places.
Services at M. E. Church South.
Rev. H. S. Shangle, presiding El
der of Oregon district, M. E. church
South, will preach at that church
next Friday, February 18, at 7:30,
p. m. The quarterly conference will
be held at the close of the meeting.
He will also preach at the Federated
church the following Sunday night.
There probably will be preaching at
the M. E. church, South, every eve
ning next week. Listen for the bell.
All are invited. W. B. SMITH,
COYOTES IN BARN ARE
KILLED WITH A CLUB
From the banks of Wrillow creek
comes a story of adventure this week
that will make the old timers sit up
and take notice, and the hero i6 John
Mclntyre.
As the story has been told to us,
John, who is working for Pat Farley,
arose early one morning and went to
the barn to feed the horses. He open
ed the barn door and to his amaze
ment the building was full of coy
otes. Visions of rabies entered his
mind and he made haste to alarm
the folks at the farmhouse.
Alex Wilson, Jim McGovern and
Mr. Farley came to li is assistance but
Mclntyre insisted that they be
cautious as the barn was full of the
mad animals and he proceeded to
open the door a small space, thinking
that perhaps some of the animals
would venture out, but failing in his
plan, he went back to the house after
several shotguns and rilies. While
on this errand, Alex Wilson entered
the ham through, a window and
found two coyotes and killed them
with a club. They had sought shel
ter in the barn and did not show any
signs of rabies.
Mr. Farley had twelve head of hor
ses housed in the barn, and nut one
had been molested by the coyotes.
