IN THE DISTRICT COURT
James Dunn Convicted of Incest,
but will Appeal to the Supreme
Court. Cases Disposed of.
District court is still in session,
-and a number of cases have been dis
posed of at this term of court.
The grand jury completed their
session on last Thursday, returning
twelve indictments. Dan Downey, of
Davis City, was indicted on two
counts for selling liquor, and Arthut
Campbell and M. E. Parsons, of
Leon, were indicted on the same
charge. All three have given bonds
for their appearance at the next term
of court. The names of the other
parties indicted have not been made
public as they have not yet been plac
ed under arrest.
The only criminal case and the only
jury case tried at this term of court
was that of State vs. James Dunn, of
Weldon. Dunn was indicted on the
charge of incest, the prosecuting wit
ness being his daughter Cecil. The
trial of the case was commenced on
Wednesday, the state being repre
sented by county attorney Geo. W.
Baker and J. S. Parrish, and the de
fendant by C. W. Hoffman and V. R.
AlcGinnis. The jury selected to try
•he case were E. S. Payton, John
Komers, Arthur Phelps, Frank Boles,
Lewis Stephens, G. H. Smith, Adam
Zika, Haze McClaran, W. F. Tenney,
Newt Finkbone, Isaac Gatton and J.
E. Brammer. There was consider
able feeling manifested among the
witnesses in the case and a largs
number of Weldon citizens attended
the trial, public opinion at that place
being divided, many insisting that
the case was a frame up against
Durn and others equally insistent
that he was guilty of this terrible
crime. The case was hotly contested
by the attorneys and was given to the
jury at 5:30 o'clock Friday evening,
and they returned a verdict of "guil
ty' 'at 10 o'clock the same evening.
The penalty for this crime is a peni
tentiary sentence of twenty-five
years. The defendant's attorneys
wefre given until yesterday noon to
file a motion for a new trial, and in
case it is not granted say they will

COLONEL W. P. HEPBURN DIED
MONDAY.
Former Congressman From This
District Was a Prominent
Politician.
Colonel William P. Hepburn, form
er member of congress from this dis
trict, died at Clarinda Monday.
Colonel Hfepburn was near death
last November, but after a time ral
lied, and a few weeks ago was so
much improved that he thought ser
iously of returning to Washington
to look after an extensive law prac
tice which he acquired after leaving
congress.
About a week ago his condition
took a turn for the worse and since
that time he has lost ground steadily.
Besides the widow, a son and a
daughter survive him.
Colonel William P. Hepburn, al
though twenty years in congress, be*
came best known throughout the
country during the Roosevelt admin
istration. It was he who framed
what was later 'called the Hepburn
law, prohibiting rebate and discrim
ination by railroads. As chairman of
the house committeo on interstate
and foreign commerce in the first ses
sion of the fifty-ninth congress he
was the author of three acts out of
five, which the then president Roose
velt afterwards declared would
cause that congress to be memorable
in history because of its constructive
legislation. Of the five acts, four
came from Colonel Hepburn's com
mittee and three of them—the Hep
burn law, the pure food act and the
public health act—were framed by
Col. Hepburn himself.
Mr. Hepburn represented the 8tn
Iowa district. He was also an effici
ent soldier and a lawyer of high repu
tation. He was a product of the
early pioneer days in Iowa and got
what little schooling he had in three
winters at an academy near Iowa
City. He was born in Columbiana
county, Ohio, November 4, 1833, re
moving to Iowa City where his moth
er and step-father took up their resi
dence
on
a farm, when he was eight
years of age. After a brief experi
ence in the schools the community
oft'orded he got employment in a
printing office where he worked for
four years. Later he read law at
IoMa City and Chicago, being admit
ted to the Illinois bar in 1854. He
returned to Iowa in 1855, married
Miss Melvina A, Morsemann, of Iowa
City and settled at Marshalltown.
When the civil war broke out Col.
Hepburn organized a company and
became its captain. This company
wgnt to the front in February, 1862,
a% a part of, the Second Iowa cavalry,
lie was soon advanced to the rank of
major'-ina-in:*that position earned
distinction at the battle of Corinth.
Not long afterwards he' was placed
on the staff of General Sheridan, and
in December of the same year be
came a lieutenant colonel and was
tit in command of the Second Bri
gade, Cavalry Division, 16th Army
Corps. He was later transferred to
other commands and seryed until the
close of the war.
Ir. 1876, Col. Hepburn moved to
Clarinda, Iowa, which had since been
his home, except for a part of the
time when he resided in Washington,
D. C. He was elected to congress in
1880 and twice successively thereaf
ter. During the Harrison administra
tion he was solicitor of the treasury
department, which position he re
signed March 4, 1893, to again enter
congress from his old district. He
was an unsuccessful candidate for
United States senator in 1888.
Col. Hepburn was thirteen times
the nominee of his party in the 8th
Iowa district, his first contest in 1880
being the most remarkable. The con
vention was held at Council Bluffs
and Congressman Sapp had received
fifty-four votes—three less than a
majority—without diminution 384
times. After a three days' session
the convention took a recess of four
days. Its second session covered two
days and Col. Hepburn was nominat
ed on the 385th ballot, receiving fif
ty-nine votes. His twelve subsequent
nominations were practically unani
mous. Two of them 'were by accla
mation. During his career in con
gress which ended March 4, 1909,
Col. Hepburn supported every mea
sure that became law looking t6 the
control of common carriers. Many
of these bills were introduced by him.
