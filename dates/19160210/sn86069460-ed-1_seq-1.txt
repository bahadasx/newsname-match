Everything Running Nicely. New
Additions Are Being Made
on Auditorium Stage
The entertainment last Friday
night was a great success. The
school made about $3500 for the
improvement fund. We thank
the people for their hearty sup
port Miss Mary Finley visited the
girls' Library Society last Fri
day. The subject of the pro
gram was the "Panama Exposi
tion." Miss Finley read a splen
did paper on this subject, and
told us some very interesting
things. We enjoyed having her
with us and invite her to come
again soon.
The stage in the Auditorium
is being enlarged. The carpen
ters are at work on it now and
hope to have it completed by
next Friday. Drop curtains and
dressing rooms are to be install
ed. After it is finished we will
hive a first-class stage on which
to give our plays and entertain
ments. The Junior class is to
give a play on Friday evening,
Feb. 18th. We ask the support
of the townspeople on this occa
sion as the proceeds of this en
tertainment are to be appropri
ated to the payment of the debt
incurred by this work.
While the carpenters are at
work injthe chapel, and we can
not have our regular chapel ex
ercises, the different classes have
exercises in their own rooms.
The boys' Literary Society is
to have a debate on the follow
ing subject: "Resolved that the
United States should within the
next fifteen years, grant the
Fhillipines their independence,
and aid them in establishing a
free and independent govern
ment" The Scimantain Society of M.
11. S., is to give a "Celebrity"
program. The lives of Caruso,
Julia Marlowe, Geraldine Farrar,
Maude Adams and several others
are to be discussed. This pro
gram is sure to be very interest
ing and instructive.

tion and maintenance. -TouringACar $410;

Corn and Pig Club
Meets At Oak Hall.
Friday night, Feb. 11th, the
Corn and Pig Clubs will have a
meeting for the purpose of r'dis
cussing plans for the coming
year, also to elect a new pres
ident. New members may join
that night but that will be the
last chance as far as the Pres
ident is informed.
Others than members are in
vited to attend. If you haven't
extra good pigs or land to use;
it will be of interest to you to
learn that by using a little of
your spare time in reading the
bulletins on soil building and
hog breeding and feeding, that
at a small expense you can make
the land more fertile and the
hogs more profitable. When you
see these things you will become
interested.
May I ask that the following
program be discussed by the
ones to whom they are assigned:
"The Value of Pure Bred Hogs"
T. A. Enoch: "Profits of Pure
Bred Corn," J. M. Dean-W. T.
Terry: "Education Gained by a
Free Trip to Louisville," Lafey
Cleghorn; "How Pigs May Be
Fed For A Profit." W. Johnson
