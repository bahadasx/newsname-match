oame in Tuesday night with seven
wolves having been out for a week.
They got these wolves by following
them on snowshoes and tiring them
out and shooting them when the
wolves were exhausted and oould
not keep out of sight. There is no

them.

The cooperation of Lake county
in building the North Shore auto­
mobile road was somewhat an un­
known quantity until our autoists
first went over their roads last sea­
son and brought back glowing re­
ports of their highways. We are
glad to note that good roads are up­
permost in their program.
The following is taken from the
Duluth News Tribuue of a recent
date:
"As a result of the action taken by
the board of county commissioners Lake
county will have sufficient funds during
the summer to construct roads that the
county has not been able to build on ac­
count of lack of funds.
J. P. Paulson, county auditor, pur­
suant to instructions from the board,
went to St. Paul and took up with the
state board of investment the question
of placing 850,000 Lake county road and
bridge bonds with the state. The state
body bv resolution accepted the appli­
cation without the formality of a speoial
bond election.
The state now holds over $2,000,000
of eastern bonds drawing 3 per cent in­
terest, and these bonds are to be dis­
posed of and the state will then loan the
money to oounties and municipalities in
Minnesota at the rate of 4 per cent.
This will add considerable to the income
of the state, and addition will make
it possible for munioipal bodies to obtain
funds at a reasonable rate of interest.
The fact that the state board of in­
vestment will not require a special elec­
tion authorizing this issue of bonds will
save a large item of expense.
A resolution was passed by the Two
Harbors Commercial club commending
the aotion of the county board in ar­
ranging for the issuance and sale of road
and bridge bonds. The board was ad­
vised that it had the unanimous support
of the Commercial club.
The board unanimously passed the re­
solution required by the state boord of
investment. Construction of highways
will start as soon as the funds are avail­
able."

ROAD
Bill for Constraction by (I. S. of
Road Through National Forost.
A bill has been introduced in the
United States Senate, bj Senator
Nelson, for the appropriation of
$50,000, to be expended by the Sec­
retary of Agriculture in cooperation
with officials of the State of Minne­
sota, in the construction of a high­
way at a point on the shore of Lake
Superior to be selected by the Se­
cretary of Agriculture, and extend­
ing thence in a northerly direction
through.the National Forest.
It may be a little premature, but
the wish is controlling that when it
comes to expenditure ot this money,
if appropriated, ample opportunity
will be given to show the feasibility
of sucli an expenditure in Cook
county. The old Gunfiint road, for
instance, dpon which there is move
traffic northward through the Na­
tional Forest than any other road on
the north shore, offers a shining
mark for the expenditure of just
about $50,000 very profitably and
in entire accord with provisions and
apparent purposes of this bill.
Val Molcic a War Prisoner
Val Molcic, or "Little Val", as he
was generally called by his Grand
Marais acquaintances, writes from
Edgewood, B. C., that lie is a
prisoner of war in an internment
camp at tiint place, with 200 other
Austrians and Germans. This in­
formation is contained in a letter
written January 23rd, by Molcic to
Fred JacksOn, and a stamp endorse­
ment on the envelope shows that it
was passed by the inturnment censor
on January 24th. Val is not enjoy­
ing life as a prisoner of war. "To
tell tne truth", he says, "life here
is not very good, and I would like
to get out" and he seems to think that
those who know him here might be
able to do something to help hiui
out of his present dilemma. Though
seasoned enough in his Americanism
not to become unduly excited over
the troubles of his mother country,
Mr. Jackson is a native of England,
and his sympathies naturally are with
her in the great war, but this will
not deter him from giving his young
Austrian frieud a helping hand if
he can do so because, he says, (and
in this all of Molcic's acquaintances
in this county will agree with him)
the la tier's well known happy
and peaceful disposition is ample
guaranty that his presence in Cana­
da is not a menace to that country
From the time of his immigration to
America in 1905, until about 1913,
Molcic resided in this county, and
there is not the slightest blot upon
the record of his stay in these parts.
He was an industrious, law-abiding
and useful citizen. It was through
mischance that he is not now
naturalized American. The records
of the clerk of court of this county
chow that he did formally declare
his intention to renounce allegiance
to the Austrian government and to
become an American citizen and he
applied to be admitted to full citi
zenship, but left this county before
the date fixed for final hearing on
same.
Jaok Scott, Jr., retnrned on the Tues
day stage. While in Duluth an opera­
tion was performed on his left eye in
wliieh a growth on the pupil of his eye
was removed. Before having the operar
tion he visited in Worthington and Min­
neapolis. He says if he had to live in
southern Minnesota be wovld have
winter home in Cook oounty as the cold
was intense in Bock oounty.
Grand Marais is scheduled to receive
a supply of brook troftt fry for some Of
our depleted streams. Our sportsmen
have interested themselves in the mat­
ter and every auto in the village has
been offered to them to promptly distri­
bute the fry. It is hoped thatjthe Game
and Fish Commission will provide a very
libera) amount of fry as the men in
charge are very muoh interested and
men who will get results, If the supply
awarded is sufficient.

INDIANS TO BET MONEY
Ewrj Chippewa Indian, Man Wo
ntan and Child to Bet $150.
Attorney Ed. Rogers, of Walker,
Minn., returned from Washington,
D. C^, where he had been spending
the past month as representative of
the Chippewa tribes of Minnesota
and local merchants of Walker rela­
tive to the payment of the Indians'
principal to them from the $6,250,
000 fund belonging to them.
He states that one-fourth of the
principal will be distributed among
the tribe members, amounting all
told to about $1,500,000, or $150 to
eyery Chippewa Indian, man, wo­
man or child enrolled. This item
libs been put in the Indian appro­
priation bill and agreed to by the
committees of both the house and
senate, and the fund will be avail­
able next summer.
There is great rejoicing among
the Indians on the prospects of the
big payment, as it will be the lar­
gest ever received.

The Read Maker.
The civilized man makes roads
the savage does not. That is the
safest test of civilization.
Among us, in all communities, are
individuals who are not really civil­
ized. They do not take any inter­
est in roads.
A man's scale in civilization is
very correctly tested by his attitude
toward the stone which has rolled
into the road or the tree whioli has
blown down across the road. The
man who drives around the obstacle
day after day is one sort of man
the one who stops his team and rolls
or drags it away is another. And a
person passing along a road which
he does not expect to retrace who
removes the obstruction for the sake
of the stranger who comes after him
responds to a very high test of civil­
ization. He feels socially.
When the snow piles up in the
road the man who goes ahead and
breaks the path for others bears the
burden which he who has made pro­
gress alyvays must bear. There is
snow in every road—to cooperation,
to better schools, to better business
methods. There must be road
breakers for every path. The road
maker is the great civilizer.—Farm
