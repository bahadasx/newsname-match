Virginia Beats Bill to
Ban Silhouette Skirts
By Associated Press
Richmond, Va.. Feb. 10.—Declar-I
ing that short skirts and low cut
waists have had more to do with the
downfall of young men than any
thing else, Delegate William Myers,
of Richmond yesterday offered an
amendment to the Browning antired
light bill which provided limitations
on woman's dress as follows:
"No female shall appear in public
within this Commonwealth with a■
skirt which does not reach within four
inches of the ground, with a waist or
bodice which exposes more than three
inches of the chest or back, and that ;
no transparent skirt shall be worn."
He said:
"Mr. Speaker, complete nudity is
more decent than the silhouettes one
sees in the summer time when the
women walk up and down the streets
of this city."
1 The amendment was defeated.

Midvale Will Increase
$75,000,000 to Care For
Cambria Purchase
Special to the Telegraph
Philadelphia, Feb. 10.—To finance!
Jils acquisition of the Cambria Steel!
company at an approximate cost of
$72,900,000, the Midvale Steel and
Ordnance company will issue $50,000,- '
j 000 twenty-year live per cent, collat
| eral trust sinking fund bonds and ;
j $25,000,000 stock now in its treasury,
j The stock will be offered at S6O a '
I share.
| The bonds are convertible into!,
stock at any time at SIOO per share. |
| They will be issued and sold to the'
' Guaranty Trust Company and Lee, |
| Higginson & Co., of New York. The i
| stock was authorized by the company i
; at its incorporation last Fall, but was j
j never issued. The stock issue has al- 1 i
[ ready been underwritten by a syndi- | J
j cate, which will probably obtain a ! ]
j commission of 2% per cent. This new j 1
! financing by Midvale means an in- < <
crease in outstanding capitalization N
from $75,000,000 to $150,000,000. N
The big issue of bonds will be safe
guarded by Midvale's enlarged earn- 1
ings and its increased property valu-! 1
ation, far in excess of the issue. The '•
, payment of five per cent, on the SSO.- !
| 000,000 bonds will mean $2,500,000 x
| annually, but the net income of Cam- i A
; bria Steel itself would be sufficient to M
i meet this charge. \

Send Along Your Ideas About i
Plan Already Adopted
in Some Cities
Advocacy by Thomas R. Marshall,
j Vice-President of the United States, of |
| a system of military training in the
[ schools and colleges of the United
I States has been echoed by many of the
i parents of the young men of llarris
j burg and the towns roundabout.
| Vice-President Marshall declared for
| three essentials in the training of the
I nation's youth.
j "1 want," said he. "some sort of
education in the educational insti
| tutions of the land whereby our young
men may be taught three things—how
j to take care of their health, how to
j take orders and how to fire a gun!"
for years the average citizen of
; America had been pretty well content
| with his small standing army and little
i navy. When the war clouds began
i rolling over all Europe, however, and
when Uncle Sam could almost see the
| flash of the lightning and hear the
thunder of the greatest clash of arms
in the history of the world, Mr, and
Mrs. America and most of the little
| Americas began to sit up and take
I notice.
| The question of preparedness nat
-5 urally has been discussed in many a
Harrisburg home. And along with it
j lias been the problem of training of
the youth in a military way in the
j high schools of the country.
The Telegraph believes that the
j problem could readily be threshed out
jin a general discussion. Every father
and a good many mothers have their
j views on the subject. Likewise many
of the youths who attend the high
| schools and academies.
! The Telegraph would like to air the '
j question thoroughly by opening its col- !
umns to a discussion. So it invites you '
! —and you—and you—to write your
! views to the paper on this one im'por- |
! tant phase of the great question before I
the nation to-day:
"Should military training be in- '
eluded in the vurrieulum of the public |
schools?"
Go ahead. Send Along your ideas
about it.
In Pittsburgh it has already been !
decided to teach the high school boys
to shoot.
Award of $7,000 to Canal
Stockholders May Result
in Recovery of $1,500,000
Special to the Telegraph
Philadelphia, Feb. 10. —Judge Dick- I
inson, in the United States District
Court, yesterday filed an opinion in
which he awards Mrs. Alice Francis
Brown, of Providence, R. 1., a bond- I
holder in the Pennsylvania Canal j
Company, $7,000 with interest from !
July 1, 1910, against the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company.
This decision is regarded as of far- |
reaching importance to other bond- i
holders in the canal company. There '
are rulings which bear directly on the
interests of other bondholders, and
while Mrs. Brown is the onlv one to
whom an award is fixed, the decree
that is to be entered later in the case
will reveal that the bondholders are!
entitled to $1,500,000 from the rail
road, according to Attorney Thomas

Brown nnd intervening plaintiff's in |
the suit, whose bond holdings i
amounted to between SBOO,OOO and
