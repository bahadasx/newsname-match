Mount Mitchell National Forest, in

beautiful and picturesque spots in the
Western World, is to be opened to the -people'
for camping and recreational
purposes.- In climate, in.. wonders of

In protection of the superb prime-'

sources, the Government 'acquired the
area of the reserve. After mature
consideration It was decided to con
vert it into a recreation parka mag
nificent playground for the people of '
the entire country. '
In conformity with this plan, the
Forest Service and the Southern Rail

of. the reserve to place at -the
disposal of those who may desiro
permanently or temporarily to locate

"I aTm very, much interested' write Z
Mr. Graves, "in the development of
the Appalachian national forests for
recreational purposes. ; The enjoyment
by the public of the national forests
for all-sorts of out-door recreation is
recognized as one of the important
ures, and ample regulations exisl for -the
purpose of facilitating this use to.
the . fullest extent. .The roads ari
trails built primarily for. the purpose
oC administration and protection are
open to"all who desire to tramp or
ride through the national forest, and .
the only restriction existing are that. y
travelers observe the ordinary precau
tions against the burning of woods or
the destruction or injury of timber or
other property. .
"Free permits may be . obtained for
temporary camping purposes and it is
required only that necessary precau
tions be taken in building and .extin
guishing the campfire, and that the.
cutting of green timber be avoided and
i that the grounds be kept An clean and

The most important problem in
connection: with the cereation devel

forests is to provide means for bring
ing the opportunities, offered to the at -k
tention of the public, and making it
easy for people who are" interested in
camping or , in building permanenr
summer homes to find the exact' loca
tions, which will best suit their needs.
In bringing this about the Southern

great, assistance through the facilities -offered,
by the organization for the dis
