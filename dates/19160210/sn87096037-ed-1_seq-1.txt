Where to buy the BEST groceries
when every grocery man claims to

enough to actually put her purchases
to a test for supremacy, she will soon
learn where the Really BEST goods
come from.

The constitutionality or the North
Oakola inheritance tax has been upheld
by Judge Hanson of the county court
at Fargo, in an opinion given in the
matter of the estate of Martin A.
Hagen, deceased. According to Slate's
Attorney A. \V. Fowler the case will
eventually go to the supreme court foi
the legality test.
*,
Attorney General H. J. Linde's rut
lag by which it is held that delegates
to the national convention must Vs
paid $200 each to cover the expense
of their trips, likely will bring about
a contest in the courts, seeking to
have the provision of the law cover
ing the expenses of national delegates
declared unconstitutional.
Under the presidential preference
act, provision is made whereby each
delegate is allowed his expenses, not
to exceed $200, for attending ttje na
tional convention. In the buget act
passed by the last legislature, an at
tempt was made to repeal such pro
vision, but the attorney general holds
this provision Is in similar position
to the tax commission approprlatian.
In that Instance, the legislature spec.
Ideally repealed the appropriation for
the tax commission, but made no ref°
erence to the tax commission law it
self. So the supreme court held that
the commission must be paid its sal*
arr expenses, etc,

AN EXCELLENT ARRAY OF
TALENT FOR SHORT COURSE
To bi Hild in Hope Feb, 22-25, inc.
Women will Hold Course too
That the tanners near Hope
will try to make the Farmers'
Short Course School whiGh will
beheld Feb. 22 to 25, inc., the
largest of its kind ever held in the
state is evidenced by the inter
est being taken and the number
who have expressed their inten
tions of attending. The great
est difficulty facing the commit
tee in charge will be the arrang
ing.of sufficient seats to proper
ly take care of the crowd. It is
expected that more than 250 will
attend.
This course will be practical in
all respects. Geo. W. Porter, a
man. who makes concrete work
his business during the warmer
mp^t^s, will be present one day.
Qement, gravel, frame lumber,
etc., have been ordered for his
demonstration. He will build a
coner for a concrete foundation,
a concrete fence post a hog
trough and as many other things
qs tijme \vill permit. He doesn't
claim to be much of a talker but
He can show how it should be
done. He was one of the great-
est drawing card at the Corn and
Clo^er^^Show" h'^ld at' ""Grand
Porks.
Dr. Vird O. Cudd, of Kansas
City, will also be here. Dr. Cudd
is, without doubt, the greatest
authority in the west on animal
breeding. He will talk on the
"Barreness of Stallions, Mares
and Cows." He will also hold a
clinic, wherein he shows various
reasons why mares refused to
breed. Dr. Cudd not only knows
his subject but he has the excel
lent faculty of stating his knowl
edge in such a clear fashion that
everyone can understand exactly
what is meant.
A. P. Borchert, now of James
town but formerly of Wisconsin,
will also be here. r. Borchert
was at one time the head archi
tect of one of the largest barn
supply houses in the United
States. He will talk on and
demonstrate the proper method
of ventilating farm buildings.
Miss Lillian Topping, of the
Florence Crittenton Home, Par
lj?o, will talk to the women on one
day, giving two of her excellent
lectures. She will speak on
''Crime" and the "Juvenile
Court". One evening she will
^ddress the both men and women
on ''The Plornece Crittenton
Pome." Miss Topping is in
touch with criminals and courts
pvery day of her life and is well
qualified to talk on those sub
jects. The Womans Federated
Clubs of North Dakota paid Miss
Topping-$100.00 to deliver one of
the lectures she will give here.
Miss Parnsworth, of the Val
ley City Normal, will be here.
That ought to draw a crowd in
itself. The girls who have gone
from here""to the Valley City
Normal have advertised Miss
^arnawortb much more favor
ably than .we could do in this
column. She is the best along

We wish that we had space to
tell all of things that should be
told in regard to all of the speak
ers that will be us the last week
in February. They will be thie
best qualified group of men and
women, in their various lines,
that haye ever visited our city.
They know their work and can
tell what they known. We do
not feel that any man or woman
in this section can afford to miss

Fitjiniary, Month Of "Red-Utter" Days
By ''Observer."
February, while the shortest
month of the year, certainly holds
its own in number of "red-letter"
days—days having some special
signifiance attached to them.
With an added day tacked on the
rear end, the month this year
also crowds September, April,
June and November for length.
Over the United States there are
thousands of people who will
this year celebrate an annivers
ary of their birth of February
2jjth who have not had an oppor
tunity for doing so for four years.
The first red-ietter day of Feb
ruary was the 2nd—candlemas,
or groundhog day, more or less
associated with supersition the
United States over. The 12th is
ap anniversary of the birth of
Lincoln, born 107 years ago. On
the 14th comes St. Valentine's
day, when little tokens of love
and remembrance are exchanged
—an ideal opportunity for us to
remind our absent relatives and
friends that they are still in our
memory. Sunday, the 20th is a
more or less widely known
chucrh day—Septugesima—
meaning the third Sunday be
fore Lent. Washington's birth
day comes on the 22nd and is the
174th anuiyftrsavy of .that evertf.
On the 27th is Sexagesima -sec
ond Sunday before Lent, and
then the 29th—Leap year Day,
the extra one added to the month
one year in four which gives the
year the title of "Leap Year," dur
ing which those girls of marriage
able age who think it is not em
barrassing to "propose" are of
fered an opportunity of doing so
themselves.
The word "February" is from
the Latin "febru," meaning to
purify.
Dental Practice Change
Dr. N. B. Benson has taken
over the dental practice of Dr.
E. L. Hughes, and commenced
active practice Tuesday. The
new addition to New Rockford's
professional men is not a strang
er to our citizens, haying been in
charge of Dr. Hughes' practice
for some time last fall and since
the first of the year. He is an
exceptionally good dentist, a
young man of promise and will
be a welcome addition to our
circle of professional men. Dr.
Hughes has been forced to dis
continue the dental work on ac
count of ill health and will devote
his time to "the more healthful
business of demonstrating and
selling automobile. The many
friends of Mi-, and Mrs. Hughes
will be pleased to know they will
^till continue to be residents of
our ci'ty.—ftew Rockford Trans

Another rule is that the copy

must not read' itW contents and
neither should' they read the
copy on the case before the com
positor. This last is considered
by the average printer to be ill
