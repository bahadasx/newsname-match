UNSETTLED
PEACE PARTY
GIVEN HEARING
BY
Opponents of Preparedness Pro­
gram Appear Before House
Military Committee.
DISCUSS WAR AND ITS*
CAUSES FROM ALL ANGLES
California Woman Tells Commit­
tee "Yellow Peril" Is Merely
a Myth.
.Washington, Feb. 9.—Opponents of
administration plans for national de­
fenses concluded their hearings to­
day in the house committees, and,
Avhile
not unanimous in their opinions
as to what should be done or left un­
done with regard to the army and
navy, they all opposed any present
change in military policy. Represent­
atives of the Society of '.Friends and
a score of others, speaking under
the auspices of the Women's Peace
parly, discussed war and its causes
and consequences from many angles.
Peace at Any Price.
They were seldom interrupted by
committee members, except where
the
open-mindedness
of congress on
the question of preparedness was as­
sailed. The views ranged from the
suggestion that congress should wait
until the close of the European war
to denunciation of a policy of mili­
tary preparedness at any time or for
any purpose. A majority of the
speakers, even the women, disclaim­
ed any sympathy with a peace at any
price doctrine but Oswald Garrison
Willard, president of the New York
Kvening Post, prefaced liis remarks
•with the statement that under cer­
tain conditions he would wear that
designation as a badge of honor.
Yellow Peril a Myth.
"If it means to believe," he said,
"that there is no cause leading up to
war which cannot .be composed and
adjudicated by international tribunes,
precisely as the quarrels of individu­
als are. vindicated, then 1 would be
willing to have the stigma of a peace
at any price banner attached to me
and shall wear it as a distinction."
lMi'sV 'lSara Baird Field of Califor­
nia, t&8«rted that the so-called Yellow
Peril was a myth. The Japaneese
and Chinese were: ibevftg,.crowded out
of ^ketowvn*
country, byr, growing pop­
ulation, shesaid. nnd the United
Slates with ya3t unoccupied lands

Mose M. Dalton, wife of a business
man here, was fatally burned and
George Manke, a fireman, suffered a
broken back today, when a fire en
gifie, answering an alarm, upset in

Dickinson, Feb. 9.—George E. Ry­
der and i^elbert Skinner have pur­
chased the Jacob Bull ranch and 200
head of cattle, including 40 head of
registered Polled-Angus stock, and
will take possession May 1. The
ranch deal aggregates $15,000 and Dr.
S. W. Bailey, the owner since last fall,
has accepted an offer to practice oste­
opathy at Roundup, Mont., which is
the reason for disposing of the prop­
erty. The new owners will call their
ranche the Skinner-Ryder Cattle Co.
UNDERWOOD SALESMEN
'Announcement has been made of
several changes to lie made in the
state by the Underwood Typewriter
company, which concern has a num­
ber' of salesmen in this state. The
change will bring well earned promo­
tions to a number of the men em­
ployed by the company in this terri­
tory.
R. te. Barrett, who has been state
manager, with oflice3 in Fargo, has
been transferred to a better position
in New York City. James Gaffney,

er, while A. F. Collar of this city,
who has had charge of the Bismarck
branch office for several years, will
take the place made vacant by the
promotion of .Mr. (Gaffney. All changes
are in the nature of promotions for
the Underwood men, and are well
deserved toy reason of the volume of
business done by the Underwood com­
pany in North Dakota. The changes
will be effective March 1.

fBecause
THIS INSTITUTIONAL
TOWN IS NOT NEUTRAL
SOME REASONS WHY
Provision Made in Indian Ap­
propriations Bill for New
Dormitory.
The Commercial club was advised
by wire from Washington yesterday
that the Indian appropriations bill,
carrying $30,000 to provide for a dor­
mitory at the Bismarck Indian school,
passed the house with little opposi
tion.
No difficulty with this appropriation
is anticipated in the senate, where
both Gronna and McCumber may be
depended upon to support the claims
of the' Bismarck school, and it is be
lieved that the funds will be avail
able in sufficient time to permit of
the completion of the additional build­
ings before the beginning of the fall
term.
The Commercial club has had this
matter up with members of the 'North
Dakota delegation, since the beginning
of the present session. It has called
attention to the cramped conditions
existing at the school, and to the
fact that ibetween 500 and 700 Indian
children in North Dakota are depriv­
ed of adequate educational advan­
tages because of the lack of proper
facilities. The dormitory will make
provision at the iB'ismarck school. for
approximately 200 students, about
double the present number, and will
relieve the situation to a large ex­
tent. It is hoped that the senate can
be induced to amend the bill to carry
$35,000 for "additional buildings," not
restricting the entire expenditure to
a dormitory, as pther structures are
badly needed, and with due economy
this amount can be made to cover all.
SPRING THAW BEGINS
IN WESTERN STATES
Seattle, Wash., Feb. 9.—The spring
thaw began in the mountains today.
Temperatures rose to 40 in the passes
through which the railroads cross the
Cascades, and rain was intermittent.
Railroad men were more hopeful to­
day than in many weeks.
The side of a 150-foot bluff in West
Seattle slid toward the sea beach to­
day, and its descent partially demol­
ished six houses. Some of the in­
habitant's were slightly injured.
Great Northern passenger train No.

Spokane, Portland and Seattle rail­
road, was derailed two miles east of

The following fifteen reasons why the state capital should
not -be moved appear in this week's Ellendale Leader and is re­
liably reported to represent the sentiment of that district. Ellen
dale has a state educational institution. It recognizes that it can­
not afford to be neutral in a movement that threatens to put wheels
under every state institution.
This is what Ellendale thinks:
FIFTEEN REASONS WHY
"The state capital should be moved to New Rockford:
"Because the State Normal School at Miuot should be re­
moved to 'a more central location.'
"Because the State School of Forestry should be removed from
Bottineau to 'a more central location.'
"Because the State Tubercular Hospital should be removed
from Dunseith to 'a more central location.'
"Because the State School for the Deaf should be removed
from Devils Lake to 'a more central location.'
"Because the State University should be removed from Grand
Forks to 'a more central location.'
Because the State Normal School should be removed from
Mayville to 'a more central location.'
"Because the State Agricultural College should be removed
from Fargo to 'a more central location.'
"Because the State School of Science should be removed from
Wallpcton to 'a more central location.'
"Because the State'Normal and Industrial School should be
removed from Ellendale to 'a more central location.'
"Because the State Normal School should be removed from
Valley City to 'a more central location.'
"Because the State Hospital for the Insane should be removed
from Jamestown to 'a more central location.'
"Because the State School for the Blind should be removed
from Bathgate to 'a- more central location.'
"Because the State iSchool for the Feeble Minded should be
removed from Grafton to 'a more central location.'

Minnesota State Treasurer Impli
cated in $28,000 Forgery
St. Paul, Feb. 9.—Walter J. Smith,
Minnesota's state treasurer, was
placed under the surveillance of a St.
Paul city detective at a Minneapolis
sanitarium today, according to R. D.
O'Brien, Ramsey county attorney,
pending a grand jury investigation ol
alleged irregularities in the handling
of certain state funds.
Mr. O'Brien said tonight that' he
would present to the Ramsey county
grand jury here tomorrow informa
tion he obtained 'from R. C. Pickett,
clerk of the state investment board*
who was taken into custody yesterday
on a charge of forgery in connection
with the same IrregularitieB, and is
said by Mr. O'Brien to have confessed
implicating Treasurer Smith.
The amount said to have been ob­
tained by the forgers is about $28,000,
and it is said to have been repaid
with interest, according to state offi­
cials. Mr. Smith is said to be threat­
ened with pneumonia, and it is not
likely he will be able to leave the san­
itarium before the grand jury has
acted in the matter. Should he at­
tempt' to leave before grand jury ac­
tion is taken, however, Mr. O'Brien
said he would be arrested and lodged
in jail.
E
Shortages revealed in the office of
the (Minnesota State treasury recall
the historic case of the North Dakb
ta state treasurer. Their similarity
was remarked upon yesterday by
many at the. state capital who are fa­
miliar with the details.
In connection with the $23,902 ir­
regularities in handling' the state
funds in Minnesota, said to have been
recovered, there appears an item of
$1$000 trust funds handled about as
follows:
An application for a loan- from the
state was made by School" District
Ho. 40 in Aitkin county.
Lyndon A. Smith, attorney general,
•approved the application. This was
followed by litigation over the legal­
ity of the district, into which had
been consolidated several schools.
In May, 1915, Judge William E. Mc
•Clenahan of Aitkin county issued a
restraining order against the consol­
idation and the case was taken to
the supreme court.

Roon Said to Be Seized Together
With German Merchant­
men.
CONFIRMATION OF
CAPTURE LACKING
British Cruiser'Drake Supposed
to Have Performed the
"Feat.
New York, Feb. 9.—British officials
here and others interested, vainly
sought confirmation tonight to the re­
port received today to the effect that
the German warship, Roon, alleged to
be the captor of the Appam,'the Brit­
ish liner recently brought into Nor­
folk, Va., by a German prize crew,
had been captured by the British ar­
mored cruiser, Drake, alter a three
hours' fight aout 200 miles east-north­
east of Bermuda. The report of the
capture was received by the New
York Evening Globe.
The capture of the Roon is said by,
The Globe to have been followed by
the seizure of two merchantmen fly
ipg the German flag, one of which was
armed.
An Associated Press dispatch to­
night from Hamilton, Bermuda, said
nothing was known there of any bat­
tle between the Drake and the Roon,
and that efforts to confirm the report
had been unavailing.
The report to The Globe, which the
newspaper says it received in code
from a reliable source in Bermuda.1
said that when the Drake first sighted
the Roon, "Segrave said: 'Please,
God, today I will avenge Craddock.'"
The Segrave mentioned in the mes­
sage is supposed to be Captain John
R. Segrave, who wa§ in command of a
vessel in the fleet ^.pinniuij^ed by the
Admiral Craddock, when the latter
went down with his flagship, The
Good Hope, in an engagement with a
German squadron off Chile.
For several days reports have been
current in maritime circles here that
the German commerce raider had
been either sunk or captured by the
British. The British consulate, how­
ever, has received no official confir­
mation of this report.
:Donate to Red Cross.
Lieutenant Berge, commander of the
German prize ship, Appam, announc­
ed he would give to the American
lRed
Cross, "mite" boxes found aboard
the ship, containing $75 contributed
for relief of widows and orphans in
England.
Half-Million Cargo.
The value of the Appam's cargo,
disposition of which must await a de­
cision of the Washington govern­
ment, was estimated by port officials
today at about
$650,000.

'J—The
German
citizens of this city and the surround^
in£ country had a citizen meeting
Feb. 6 in the "Deutsche Eintracht"
hall, to discuss the endorsing of can­
didates for the county and state
offices for the coming election. The
meeting was well attended and many
interesting speakers spoke during the
afternoon program.
Mr. Jacob Rothschiller, president of
the German-American Alliance of
North Dakota, acted as chairman. In
his speech, he said:
"The Germans should turn out and
do and their duty on election day. No
German should accept anything from
a candidate. Therefore, the Personal
Liberty League of North Dakota has
put out buttons for sale, price $1.00,
and every citizen should buy one of
them. .The amount collected from the
sale of these buttons helps the league
to endorse and elect their ticket with­
out any other support from candi­
dates. With this plan carried out the
German element will show a clean
campaign."
Some of the other speakers on the
program were: Hon. Frank X. Wan­
ner, Hon. H. J. Blanchard, J. P. Cain,
lawyer of Dickinson. Wm. Blume, and
several others. Mr. Blume also an­
nounced that he would be a candidate
for state's attorney.
It' was agreed that on March 5 a
delegate meeting would be held at the
St. Anthony's hall at Dickinson. At
this meeting the candidates for coun­
ty offices will be endorsed, btark
county is well organized with German
lodges and the people are well. in­
formed on county and state politics.

Military Bill.
SENATE AND HOUSE
BILLS WILL DIFFER
Expected Military Bill Will Be
Ready for House Within
Two Weeks.
Washington, Feb. 9.—With Presi­
dent Wilson, personally urging both
Democratic and kepuuuean members
of the house military committee, to
hasten preparation of bills tci. carry
out the arrny'B part in the national
preparadness scueme, indications to
Tifght were that the measure might be
ready for the house within two wpeks
or less.
Hearings will come to a close to­
morrow, or next day, and it is under­
stood the main features of the bills
already have been whipped into shape
in which it is expected they will re­
ceive virtually the unanimous approv­
al of the committee.
Draft Proposals.
The senate committee already has
concluded its hearings on army bills
and will take up the work of drafting
its proposals for the senate early next
week. There also, the general out­
line of the plan to be recommended,
has crystalized in the minds of the
members.
The bills of the two houses, it is ex­
pected, will differ radically, and the
final legislation will be worked out as
a compromise in conference.
Navy Plans Pass House.
Progress also was made today on
navy legislation, the measures paving
the way for construction of battle­
ships 43 and 44, at navy yards, and
providing for 300 additional midship­
men in the July class at Annapolis
being passed by the senate. They
passed the house today and lack only
the president's signature to bccomc
law.
Committee Favor Suffrage.
A house judiciary sub-committee, by
a vote of 4 to 3, today recommended
to the full committee the reporting to
the house "without recommendation'
of the Susan B. Anthony constitution­
al amendment for nation-wide woman
suffrage. It is in accordance with the
action of the committees of the past.
Refuse to Meddle.
On objection by Republican Leader
Mann, the house today declined to
consider a resolution by Representa­
tive Clark of Florida providing for
calling of a peace congress of neutral
nations by President Wilson.
Special Pension Bill.
Special pensions of $10 a month
each and places on a roll of honor for
former soldiers, holders of medals of
honors, and over 65 years old, are
authorized in a bill introduced by
Representative Sherwood of Ohio and
passed today by the house. It is esti­
mated that not more than 1,000 veter­
ans come into the provisions of the
measure
Another pension bill designed to
benefit widows of Spanish war volun­
teers, who served more than 90 days,
aroused much discussion and finally
went over until next Wednesday with
out action.
To Flood Districts.
Arrangements were completed to
day by the new flood control commit­
tee of the house for an inspection tour
through the Mississippi flood district.
The committee will leave Saturday af­
ternoon and return to Washington
about February 21.
Armenian Relief Day.
The senate today adopted a resolu
tion proposed by Senator Lodge, re­
questing the president to set apart a
day on which the public might contri
bute to the relief of distressed Ar
menians.

BOSTON LAWYER INSISTS
ON TOO HIGH RETURNS
Washington, Feb. 9.—Charging that
Louis D. Brandeis, as counsel for the
interstate commerce commission in
the five per cent advance rate case,
conceded to the cause of the railroads
to the fatal injury of the public inter­
est, Clifford Thorne, railroad commis­
sioner of Iowa, and an associate coun­
sel in the rate case, appealed tonight
to the judiciary committee of the sen­
ate not to recommend confirmation of
Mr. Brandeis' nomination to the su­
preme court of the United States.
Costly to People.
.Mr. Tliorne argued that it would be
very costly to the American people to
put men on the supreme court bench
with preconceived notions as to high
returns on railroad investments, in
view of the fact that institutions in­
volved in the nation's appraisement
now going on, ultimately would have
to be determined by that tribunal.
Summoning up his case, he de­
clared:
"1 have showed conclusively from
the records that Mr. Brandeis has
committed himself to the proposition
that a return on the capital stock of
railroads of 7% percent' is, to use his
own wqrds, 'rather meagre.' That is,
the return Which the interstate com­
merce commission unanimously deter­
mined was adequate. Furthermore,
the investors of this country have de­
cided that a stock yielding 7% per­
cent' in the market places of the coun­
try is worth 100 cents on the dollar.
Was 'Double-crossed?
"I have shown that Mr. Brandeis
co-operated in a friendly manner dur­
ing the conduct of the case, with as­
sociate counsel, yet at the crucial
time, Mr. Brandeis, without warning
to other counsel, after all arguments
had been closed on behalf of the pub­
lic, conceded entirely to the railroads.
Had I known that such was going to
be his position, had he advised us of
his decision, steps certainly would
have been taken for our protection,
and we would have have demanded
an opportunity to be heard after Mr.
Brandeis had closed the arguments
for the public. I consider that his
concession was practically fatal to
the cause of the public. Our work
was useless.

FURIOUS COMBAT ON
WESTERN BATTLE FRONT
Teutons Take French Positions
Over Length of 800 Yards
Grenade Fighting.
London, Feb. 9.—Two women and
one child were injured this afternoon
when two German seaplanes raided
the Kentish coast, dropping bomta.
Three missies fell on the outskirts of
Rainsgate, four near a school at
Broadstairs, the material damage Is
said by the war department' to have
been confined to the shattering of
glass.
The attack was made in broad day­
light. At 3:30 o'clock this afternoon,
two seaplanes were reported ap­
proaching the Kentish coast, and a
few minutes later they flew over
Ramsgate and Broadstairs.
A number of naval and military
aeroplanes and seaplanes ascended to
attack the Germans, but they immed­
iately retreated. As no engagement
between the airmen has been report­
ed, it is presumed that the Germans
made good their escape.
Germans Take Trenches.
The French and Germans have been
engaged in furious combats on thfe
sector of the wesern battle front be*
tween Lens and Arras, where recent­
ly there has been great activity.
Berlin reports that to the west of
the town of Yimy, the Germans cap­
tured French positions over a lerigth.
of 800 yards.
Paris admits that the Germans' af­
ter the explosion of two heavily charg­
ed mines, got a foothold in pottloiis
of a French crater, but say they Were
driven out by hand grenade atufcfcs.
Paris also, reports that the French,
in a -grenade attack, drove- the Ger­
mans from a small post,- between Bote
sons and Rheims, and that tbe
French batteries have badly damaged
German organizations in the forest of
Apremont, southeast of St. Maihiel.
Russians Repulsed.
On the Russian fronts, 'Berlin' ret
cords the repulse^ of Russian infantry
attacks at several points in the Riga
region. A Petrograd dispatch -says
severe fighting is developing in this
district, the preliminary artillery
duels having changed into bombard­
ments of great intensity. ,.
Answer Delayed.
Great Britain's reply to the Ameri­
can governtnent's protest against the
British blockade has been delayed
and probably will not be sent to
Washington during the present
month.
Change of Commanders.
General Sir Horace Lockwood
Smith-Dorrien has relinquished the
command of the British forces operat­
ing in East Afriea, owing1to-tH-health,
it was officially announced tonight.
General John A. Christian "Smuts,
the minister of the interior, mines
and defenses, of the Unit of South
Africa, has accepted the vacancy,
with the rank of temporary lieutenant
general, the announcement added.
Work For Cripples.
At the convention of the German
Orthopedic society, which is now in
session in (Berlin, many inventions of
methods for repairing the wastes of
war have been exhibited or discussed.
Dr. Ferdinand Sauerbruch, profes­
sor of surgery at Zurich university,
showed the delegates an artificial
hand which was able to grasp ob­
jects of all forms and to lift weights
up to 200 pounds. An entirely novel
feature of the hand is that it and the
fingers are controlled by muscular ac­
tion in the upper arm, which is pre­
pared for such work by two oper­
ations. The muscular power, after­
wards, is transmitted to the hand
through a system of wires and pul­
leys to which all the fingers respead.
