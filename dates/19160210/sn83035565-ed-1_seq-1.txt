Editor Journal-; We havo had
cold weather since I last wrote to
the Jouriial. There was a storm
on the bay awW'e had a cold
north wind. The thermometer
, MS down to 48 and we were
very clad to have a fire to sit by
This mofhine it is just cool en
ough for cormoit. ,
Business, conditions here are
not as good as two years ago,
x Several places have a sheriff's
ssal across the door, and others
are just down aid out. One gro
cer has accounts running to near
ten thousand dollars and says he
does not expect to collect any:
thing. ,It seems to me that bus
iness here is . only a game of
f
chance.
There is an abundance of cit
ras fruits, there are numerous
vegetable patches, and fish plen
tiful and cheap while the season
is in, but the sale of fruits and
vegetables by shipping is not the
wondrous succes.3 financially that
they say. There is money when
there are tourists, and Providence
provides at other times.
The Holy Jumpers, or Pente
cost people, bomething like our
Rollers, have a tent here and are
getting quite a following. A
party of us went one Sunday
night, but left about 10 o'clock,
so did not see the most violent
capers. T. J.' said there was an
other reel yet, but we had seen a
plenty. They went through all
phases of emotional excitement
jumping, laughing, jabbering,
kicking, raving up and down,
little children in hysterics; it
sounded like pandemonium. They
claim tu heal by faith, ad, ' by
the way, they livre the same way
they furnish the faith and their
followers furnish the board. They
will live off anyone just as
long as they are allowed.
We visited the colored school
one day; they have an exceed
ingly plain building of two rooms.
Poor souls! life does not offer very
bripht prospects in the way of
instruction and education. There
is one young girl here who is a
prodigy in her classes and in mu
sic We hope to know of her go
ing to Tuskogee, the late Booker
T. Washington's college.
There is a colored woman here
with a singing voice that would
admit her anywhere if she was
white, but as it is that voice is
figuratively buried. ,
Theie is a large packing house
here for packing oranges, grape
fruit and tangerines. You can
go there any day they are at
work and carry away any of the
fruit "they may be handling, all
you can load on. The rejected
fruit looks quite perfect to our
unskilled eyes and it seems -a
shame for whole crates, often a
. half dozen, to be dumped out
each evening. The children flock
there after school, it being quite
close. The process of packing is
very interesting. The crates of
fruit are emptied into a sort of
. trough which moves by machin
ery, the fruit being earned along
chutes with cloth flaps which
give a cleaning rub along the
way till the fruit reaches the
graders, who roll each fruit into
grooves, from where it is carried
into partitioned place3, according
to size;' an experienced wrapper
will pick up a labelled tissue coy
ering and the fruit simultaneous
ly 'and with one deft twist wraps
it and then into a crate it goes.
The crate passes right on to the
man who nails on the cover, then
onto a little truck and into the
waiting freight car. But if you
buy oranges, they are about as
cheap at home as they are here.
They do not do much with lemons
here. '
We went to Fort Meyers, 25
miles south of here, on January
27. Iff is very warm there and
vegetation more tropical. The
place is on the Calocsahatchie
river and is a great place for
boats. We had a look at the town
n general, the Royal Palm Hotel,
the new court house, not yet com
pleted, but we wt.nt to the top
and scrambled out on the roof,
which has a high coping, and got
a wonderful view. We spent
most of our time at Thomas Edi
son's home, in the suburbs. Here
there are about 'three acres of
ground, planted with almost ev
ery shrub and; tree you might
mention"; -" There' are some unusu
ally large mango' trees, cocoanut
palms, also royal palm?. There
are two houses, exactly alike,
connected by a verandah - and a
stairway. The windows ,are from
the floor up. The furnishings are
fine and good, but not gorgeous.
He has a long pier and private
boat house, also a large cement
swimming pool. There is a work
shop where he spends most of his
days when in residence. There
is also a nice lot of chickens.
ooked after by the caretaker
who has a cottage. We have, as
a souvenir of our visit, a grape
fruit weighing 31 pounds.
Last Tuesday night the Ladies'
Civic League gave a reception to
the tourists, in the nprth lobby
of the big hotel. ,.: Refreshments
were served and, it was a most
enjoyable affair. ' We Ohioans
are in the majority and are not
slow tq praise our" state. A lady
said yesterday that she did not
see how it was so many Ohio peo
ple come down here. She was
told we had everything so plen
tiful up there we felt it safe to
leave now and then. There is an
Ohio man in business here and he
is duing very well. He received
a shipmept of fine tobacco from
J. C. Ross of Palestine, a few
days ago, and was well pleased.

New Model Frocks and
Wraps.
"It's' always - summer some
where," somsone remarks, and
therefore designers find" excuse
for rushing advance models, and
enticing he money rom private
pocket books into the tills of
trade, which'keeps things mov
ing, and a lot of people indus
triously employed.
TiltingHips.
The tight hip has vanished
from any outer apparel, except a
few conservative' sport skirts.
Tip tilted lines are the rage for
hip draperies, and the waist de
fined by full wft gathers where
puffings are not preferred, yet
the strapped girdle of substan-
tial silk continues in vogue and
offers efficient aid to the woman
who would look unshapely in the
meal bag" adjustment of drap
enes. une of the favorite meth
ods of draping leaves wide pock
ets of drapery at the hips usually
two on either side and stiffens
these with trimmings that insure
their fashionable swaying tilt, so
charming on lithe slender wear
ers, but quite impossible for oth
er people.
McCall Design
Panel Effects.
Some of the prettiest models
shown, built of lace and silk or
satin, have the more substantial
fabric disposed in long panels,
like wide stripes over the lace
petticoat, while the waist trim
ming carries out the same effect.
This type of dress becomes the
woman who can not wear flam
boyant hip draperies and lends
itself admirably to refurbishing
a partly worn dress, or to con
structing a pretty gown of a
short length of silk or velvet.
Never have I seen so many op
portunities for using remnants
for modish fancy frocks as later
models ff er. Hkrdly ny dress
is built of less than three mater
ials and often more are used with
excellent results. , -
Materials and Trimmings.
Taffeta silk is still leading for
fussy Crocks of all sorts, nd"
spangled trimmings are extreme-1
ly modish. , At the opera a few
nights since, I was especially im
pressed with a wrap all of green
spangled net that shimmered and
shone in enticing fashion at ev
ery movement of the wearer.

make gorgeous wraps that are a
most striking color note of fash
ionable audiences, and a most
necessary protection when waists
as flimsy as those now worn ex
pose their wearers to the slight
est chill or draft.- Even the scarfs
that cover the neck are of tulle,
which, while undoubtedly becom
ing, afford even less protection
than the former chiffon throws.
Voluminous as to cut, most of the
evening wraps one sees can be
readily copied at home with the
aid of a good pattern and clever
seamstress, and a well selected
coat of this sort lasts several sea
sons and pays . for itself many
times over in comfort and ap
pearance. . , ;
Fashionable Coiffures.
Fashionable coiffures are ex
tremely simple following closely
the lines of the head. Even the
waving is done ons natural lines
as possible while many of the
younger set elect to wear the hair
parted and straight and caught
in a small knot at the neck in very
simple and classic lines. Except
for the filet bands and wreaths
few-ornaments are worn, except
by the dowagers, who still cling
to pompadours and marcel waves,
with jewelled combs and pins.
Long Sleeves and Glcves.
The mode fa' "for ' either ' long
transparent sleev s reaching the
wrist, or none at ill, and with
9
either mode glove i are often as
dispensed with as worn. It seems
to be quite a matl er of taste or
inclination as fanion endorses
either method.
A Pretty Af telnoon Frock
of pale tan Rodinr voile, seen
lately, had the f uJ straight gath
ered skirt banded rith black satin

well up toward the belt. The
J
lower band about three inches in
width and the others graduating
up to half an inch! Strange to
say, these graduated bandings do
not shorten the wearer as even
widths do. The waist draperies
were edged with the narrowest
width ribbon, and the sash made
of the widest width. Summer
frocks can be made up now with
assurance that there will not be
many changes in style from the
models already launched.

The. ground hog gave us a
schedule of wintry weather last
week for a period of six weeks.

what tyrannical, but thus it is
and thus it behooves us to be

without question, knowing that

with large crowds in attendance
every night, with good music and
interesting exercises. On last
Saturday night our I. 0. 0. F.

our Jr. 0. U. A. M. lodge will at
tend as a body to assist in giving

spiritual uplift in our community
and will surely result in a religi

Colds Need Attention
Internal throat and chest trou
bles produce inflammation, irri
tation, swelling or soreness and
unless checked at once, are likely
to lead to serious trouble. Caught
in time Dr. Bell's Pine-Tai-Hon-
ey loosens the phlegm and des
troys the germs which have set
tled in the throat or nose. It is
soothing and healing. Pine is
antiseptic; honey is soothing
both together possess excellent
medicinal qualities for fighting
cold germs. Insist on Dr. Bell's
