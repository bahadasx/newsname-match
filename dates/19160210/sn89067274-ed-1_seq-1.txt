THE NEW JAIL. ,
THE Ledger is- glad to know that
county finances ara getting in such
shape that the court is beginning to
arrange tha details in the direction of
erecting a new modern Jail. There
seems to be some question regarding
the site. 8ome favor buildinv tha
jail where the old one is while others
think there should be more ground.
The Audrain County Jail has been re
peatedly condemned and for some
time has been really a disgrace to the
county. s ' ., ' ,;
The court is to be congratulated on
its wise and economical handling of
the funds without any bond issue.
Very few public buildings are ever
built without either a direct tax or
a bond issue to pay for the same.

Washington, Feb. 5. Secretary of
the Interior Lane announces hat ap

Entries will be received March 24
and the drawing will be held later.
In making the announcement the
Department of the Interior says: '
"Homesteaders will find here near
ly sixty thousand acres in tillage,
with hundreds of comfortable farm
buildings. Cities and towns are flour
ishng, schools have been established
and excellent transportation facilities
are provided.
"The annual harvests now total mil
lions of dollars and the pioneering
stage of development has long since
passed. Taken in connection with a
fertile soil, lotr cost of preparation of
land, good markets, and a healthful
climate, these farms should prove ex
ceptionally attractive to homestead-
ers irom wi wiiooiaa,. , j
states."
Under the terms of the reclamation
entrymen are allowed twenty years
to pay for water rights. The second
payment does not fall due for five
years after the date of making entry.

Gentlemen:
Los Angeles, Cal., Feb. 3rd, 1916.
Enclosed you will find money order
for $1.00 to cover renewal of moth
er's subscription for the Ledger.
We have thought we could per
haps manage to get along without
"The Mexico Ledger,' but mother finds
in each week's issue so many items of
interest pertaining to her acquaint
ances in her old home town, we have
concluded to delay the renewal no
longer. Each Monday we anxiously
await the arrival of your paper and
are glad to see that while we are in
the midst of our rainy season in
Southern California and are having
some heavy rainstorms, still the tem
perature is much lower here than in
the Eastern States. And when we
consider the fact that we are usually
blessed with sunshiny weather from
May until November or December, we
are indeed thankful we are in California.
Mother and Charles greatly miss
the old home ties in Mexico, but the
Ledger" seems to be the connecting
link between the old ties and the new.
I have been in the Bayless family
as a daughter-in-law for only a few
months and am not, therefore, famil
iar with the many names constantly
mentioned in your paper, but in time,
I hope to be one of its regular readers
and patrons.
I am an enthusiast for California
and consequently, am not a booster
for cold climates such as you have in
Missouri. Think of it! Now the hills
around us are clothed in green and
many roses and other flowers are in
bloom. At all times during the year
the fruits and vegetables in season
can be bought at surprisingly low
prices.
, We are not desirous of offering
any inducements to residents of Mex.
ico to come West, but simply wish to
say that Los Angeles is a very fine
place in which to live.
With best wishes for the success
of your publication, I am,
Respectfully yours,
Mrs. Chas. E. Bayless.
MERCHANTS HELP HOME.
Tuesday the King's Daughters sol
icitors for the Old Ladies Home met
with success when they presented
their solicitation to the Mexico mer
chants. The Committee does not
know the exact amount that was
given but aay that it wait as much as
waa obtained last year j through the
same means. They wish to thank the
merchants for the hearty response and
aid given the Home. I
This organization wilt not have a
tag day at the Fair this year, and it
may be of interest to know while the
local circle pays seven hundred dol
lara towards the support of the Home,
annually many other circles over the
state are sending their contributions
here and that all of the twenty four
hundred dollars necessary in keeping
up the Home is spent here amoung
our own merchants.
There are thirteen old ladies now
being cared for in the Home, and nine
applications are on file seeking an
entrance at the earliest opportunity.

A CREDIT BUREAU IS NOT
A CIRCULATING BLACK LIST
"If you have a properly managed
credit bureau, merchants, you will
get tangeable money results that you
can see with the naked eye," said C.
O. Hanes, secretary of the Columbia
Commercial Gub and Retail Merch
ants Association, as he spoke at the
Mexico Commercial vClub's luncheon
Friday night
"A Credit Bureau that rates every
one in the community; keeps a line on
all new arrivals; obtains their rating
from their old home; keep all merch
ant and members posted on all mat
ters such as chattel mortgages, deaths,
divorces, marriages, etc., that will af
fect the credit rating of any indivi
dual; and keeps its information up to
the minute is an asset to any city its
merchants and its consumers."
"Columbia has over eleven thousand
men and families rated, and more than
thirty six thousand rating on people
in the trade vicinity. AH information
of the association in the Columbia plan
must come through the Credit Bureau
office and in that way it is not neces
sary to publish a black list When
ever a new account is extended the
Credit Bureau is called and the desir
ed information is given the member.
In the case of all disputed accounts
the debtor is always given the benefit
of the doubt in making his rating.
According to Mr. Hanes people
who are extended credit can be divided
as follows: 20 per cent pay promptly;
40 per cent are good but slow; 20 per
cent slow pay and 20 per cent are un
desirable. It has been estimated that
each year $50,000,000 is lost in bad
credit extended in the United States.
After the rating is obtained and
credit has been given by a merchant,
the association has two form" bill
which are used in collecting the money
when a debtor is inclined to be slow or
indifferent about an accountFirst the
merchant sends the debtor a special
account blank, and if in' reasonable
time this is not answered the associa
tion from its office sends a letter to the
debtor. Six days are given him in
which to settle or his credit rating la
changed.
"The success of the Bureau in my
mind," said Mr. Hanes, "depends on
the fact that eversone knows that all
the information is confidental and kept
in the association offices. Even the
consumer in Columbia realizes that it
helps him. By eliminating the "Dead
Beats" and by incouraging prompt
payment of bills, the merchant's risk
cost ia decreased and he will give it
back to the customer in one of two
ways: make smaller margins or give
better goods."
Mr. Hanes also spoke on the trade
at home movement It has been his
observation that less knocking of
mail order bouses and more time to
boosting your own business produce
the desired results. Adopt the slogan
Buy in Mexico" and create the sen
timent Give quantity, quality, ser
vice and advertise, is Mr. Haines per
scription to keep the trade in the community.
One of the most important com
mittees of the Columbia Commercial
Club is the vigilence committee that
looks into all advertising and charity
propositions that are submitted to the
club. This committee is "blind" and
known only to the president so that it
can be unhampered in Its work. When
cook books, score cards, programs,
moving picture advertising, etc., are
submitted to the club members for
their patronage, this committee look
into the matter and reports to the pre
ident who passes the report on to the
club. It has been found that such ad
vertising is only ten per cent efficient
Stock Saled Day in Columbia la held
on the third Monday of each month.
It has proven a big success due to
the able management of the Boone
County farmers who have taken ac
tive interest in the Bales, and con.
sider the success or failure of the
proposition up to them.
Fli PIKE COITT LAND
WAS NOT ENTERED
J. W. Daniel of This City, Discover
Forty Acres in McPike Tract in
Peculiar Condition.
WAS A SURPRISE TO CLAIMANT
Patent Was Finally Procured by Pur-
chase of the Land From the Gov
ernment Quite Recently.
J.- W. Daniel, of this city, in exam
ining sows land titles not long ago
discovered forty acres in Pike county,
three 'miles east of Vandalia which
had never been entered f rem the gov
ernment by any one. That any land
in this part of Missouri had ever es
caped being entered in the land office
department at Washington hardly
seemed possible but investigation
proved this to be true.
The land was held by Hardin Mc
Pike and a patent waa secured
for it by purchase on the part of Mr.
McPike, then owner through thl land
office department and Springfield, Mo.
Mr. Daniel says this is the first in
cident of its kind that he ever heard of
this section of the state as most of
the land has all been properly entered.
