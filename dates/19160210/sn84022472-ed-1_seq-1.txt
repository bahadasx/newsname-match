, Unless a great number of homes are
inade available during the next week
or so, more than 1,000 persons will ba
; eholterless in the Bast End.
The Remington, 'Arms & Ammuni
tion Co. gave notice today and yes
terday to 240 families that they must
vacate .their'' houses before Feb. 21.
Panic was tlie result today, in the
district affected, and there is a wild
.' ecurrying about the Cast Side and
East End to find places.

broke lake, Ogden street, from Helen
." to the lake, part of Wyllvs place, part
( Of Helen street, and Seaview avenue
between, Ogden -street- extension and
Arctic street, have givem homes to
these families. The Remington real
estate department has 'obtained own-r
' ership of the property, and because- of
the necessity of housing its own tm-
ployes. it has ordered the tenants out.
Eviction is likely to be employed he
fore the end of the month.

sumed that Work-will begin in March,
tearing down the houses and replacing
them with new dwellings for. Reming

five or- lx houses of tho old type re
main, and these 'win go soon.
- A coincidence in . connection : with
" this has been noted. The streets af
fected by the changes are peopled
with Slavonians and Austrian. Their
' eviction will mean their removal from,
the vicinity of the vast plant th alt is
making munitions for the Allies.
During the last s few weeks, . it is
known that hundreds of' Austrians,
Germans, Hungarians and Slavonians
have: been refused jobs at the" Rem

er of the applicant was of any of these
nationalities, he Is rejected. . -
The Slavonians; hundreds of whom
will find themselvea.homeless, 'find a
grim humor in this. Despite the fact
that their passports hear the. official
marks ot Austria or Hungary, . thev
are opposed to the Central Powers in
tho war'.. As they had no government
. f their own in Europe, officially, they
came from Austria and Hungary.
These passports bar them from the

A
SAYS LATE MRS. KEPPY VOICED
SORROW OVER HER DAUGHTER'S
: FONDNESS FOR; MEN AND MONEY
"Florence's fondness for men and
moneyHas caused me considerable ex
pense," is the statement the late Mrs.
Fred Keppy is alleged, to have made
concerning her daughter, Florence
Keppy Walters, one of the defendants
in -the action to bresEk'Mrs. Keppy's
will. This testimony was given by
Mrs. Jesse . A. L. Keppy, of Oakland,
Cal., before Judge Gager and a jury
In the superior court this morning
when the hearing on " Maude Keppy
Whetl's appeal from probate was re
sumed. : ;
The witness declared the elder Mrs.
Keppy expressed the opinion that it
wasn't right for Florence to be going
around with Mr. "Vernon of this city
while she was married to Walters,
even if she had separated from the
latter. The elder Mrs. Keppy told the
witness she felt bad about Florence's
divorce from Mr. Hunt, her first hus
band, and later her affair with Wal
ters, who had been named as co
respondent in the action.
While this testimony was being
given Mrs. Walters sat in the court
room and looked scornfully at the wit
ness, her sister-in-law. . Mrs. Jesse
Keppy said she learned all these facts
when her mother-in-law came to visit
her in Portland, Ore., at the time of
her marriage to Jesser in 1909.
The elder Mrs. Keppy declared she
always liked her daughter Maude. She
had words of praise for Florence's
shrewdness as- a business woman but
did not approve of her conduct in
other matters. The witness said her
mother-in-law told of loaning Flor
ence $65 to start housekeftping with
Walters and also loaning her $100 at
another time to" pay the balance due
on a" piano. Mrs. Walters smiled
when the witness declared she often
went without new clothes so her hus
band could send money from the" Pa
cific coast to Ziis mother in this city:

the Ceneral Freight , association terri
tory. Further, I said he would ' take
the position that methods pursued by
the carriers to ,ob tain their revenues
through a horizontal 5 per cent, in
crease was jiot the proper method of
increasing their . revenues.
. "I am quite clear that, it was as the
result - of this conversation that Mi-,
Thorne wrote Mr. Brandeis a-, note
asking about a change, in' the allot
ment of time. . It is very strongly my
Impression - that because "Hr," Thorne
recognized the attitude Mr. Brandeis
would take that. Mr.. Brandeis got the
conception 'that Mr. Thorne wanted
an opportunity to answer him in ad
dition to his main argument in the,
case."
. Mr. Carmalt was called to the stand
on, suggestion of George W. Anderson,
United States district attorney in Bos
toii, who ' is attef-ding the hearings.
His testimony was regareted by friends
of Mr.' Brandeis as being very much
in his favor.
Chairman .Chilton stated that hla
understanding was that Mr. Brandeis
was employed to assist in developing
"all sides of the case" and asked Car
malt if Brandeis helped Thorne de
velop his side. ' Carmalt replied that
he did. .and said that the data collect
ed from the railroads by the commis
sion under - the general direction of
Mr. Brendels was available to all.
Senator Clark' asked if Mr. Brandeis
was not employed s to develop the
r""other side of the case" on the as
sumption that i. the railroads' side
would be adequately, cared for. -
"He was not retained for the rail
roads," responded Carmalt. "He was
to develop the whole' tease. I think
tlie commission assumed the railroads'
case would be taken care of by . their
attorneys,". :,.;;

was the first witness today. He is the
son of the late Fred Keppy; who was
chief engineer at Warner Bros.: ' When
his mother; lied -in 1915 the' witness
said he did not get a cent. He and
his sister, Maude Wheeler,., who was
cut off with $1, therefiore brought the
present action to break the will.
Keppy said he left his: home In ,this
city in 1904. When aeked . the reason
he said it was because of his father's
drinking . habits. . -When : the elder
Keppy was intoxicated Jesse said he
was often abused so he told his fa
ther he intended n to live somewhere
unless conditions , improved. When
there was no improvement . Jesse went
away. "
Keppy declared that he come east in
1911 at the request of his mother,- who
said she couldn't get any money fro in
her husband's estate, of which Flor
ence was executrix. His ' mother
claimed that no accounting had been
died but it was learned afterward that
an accounting had been filed. Keppy
claimed- he sent . his mother money toy
oheek and money order and that he
vaa always on friendly terms with
her.
A deposition' of Mrs. Julia A. Stev
ens of 259 Beach street, was read.
The witness had lived next to the
elder Mrs. Keppy for 11 years in Park
street. She said Mrs., Keppy always
spoke kindly of Maude and her son,
Jesse. Regarding Mrs. Keppy's men
tal condition the witness said she was
bright when normal but after she had
a shock she complained : that she
couldn't think. .
"I can't think. ' I can't say what
I want to say," she is alleged to have
said.1 ;
White she was in this condition it
Is claimed, that Mrs. Florence Keppy
Walters unduly influenced Mrs. Keppy

Lansing Asks Austria About
Shelling of Tanker Petro
lite By U-Boat.
"DEMANDS" TO COME
LATER, BELIEF HERE
Novel Questions Involved in
Latest Probe of Subma
rine Warfare.
Washington, Feb. 10. Secretary
Lansing announced today that he had
sent to the Austro-Hungarian govern
ment, through Ambassador Penfleld, a
despatch asking for an investigation
and an explanation of an attack by an
Austrian submarine on the American
tank steamer Petrolite.
The secretary said published state
ments that demands had been made
upon the Vienna government, were
not true" but that it was "within the
range of possibility that demands of
some sort might be made in the fu
ture should the investigation and ex
planation asked warrant them.
The secretary's report called atten
tion to affidavits from members of the
crew of the Petrolite and to informa
tion from other sources to the effect
that the ship was stopped in the
Mediterranean near Alexandria by an
Austrian submarine, which tired upon
her and wounded one man in her en
gine room.
The submarine commander asked
for food, which ' Capt. Thompson of
the Petrolite refused. He thereupon
sent a boarding party aboard the
American ship and. removed one
American member of her crew, who
was held as a hostage while the Aus
trians took the food they required
from the Petrolite's stores.
Novel questions are involved in the
case, warships unaer certain stress
may take food from merchantmen if
they give proper receipts or payment,
but it Is realized that if submarines
are to be permitted to do so every
neutral ship might be made a base for
their operations.
' Zimmerman Correctly Quoted.
New York, Feb. 10 On Feb. 7
Secretary of State Lansing made .the
following statement in connection, with
the Lusitania case :
"All I wish to say in that this gov
ernment ' has not increased its. de
mands in the Lusitania case as set
forth, in the notes of May 13, June
9, and July 21. Idoubt very much
if Dr. Zimmerman ever made such a
statement, because he must know it
is utterly false."
This was in reference to a state
ment attributed to Dr. Alfrea Simmer
man, under-secretary. for foreign af
fairs, in an interview with The As
sociated Press published Febi 4 in
which he said:
"I do not understand America's
course. . He had thought the subma
rine issue settled and the Lusitania
case on the way to an arrangement-)
had agreed to pay indemnity and all
that when the United States sudden
ly made its -new demands, whichy it is
impossible for us to accept."
When Secretary Lansing's statement
was issued ' The Associated Press
cabled its correspondent in Berlin for
confirmation lof the 'phrase attributed
to Dr. Zimmerman. Today that cor
respondent has cabled the following
statement:
"Berlin, Feb. 9 The text of the
interview with Under-Secretary Zim
merman was 'submitted to him and
approved by him before it was cabled.
Regarding the phrase, 'new demands'
it is literally exact. The correspond
ent immeaiately countered with a
question regarding the nature of these
demands, 'without eliciting any an

Hallen Fund Will Be Used
For Books Somerset
Memorial Planned.
WHEELER LIBRARY
TO BE AUGMENTED
French Literature Likely As
Memorial To Late Mem
ber of Faculty.
Before many months, the Bridge
port High school library will be tripled
in sifce, if plans that are still in the
embryonic stage materialize.
The Hallen. Memorial, the Somerset
Memorial and the Wheeler Memorial
will form the new library, according
to hopes that bid fair to be fulfilled
Students, former students and mem
bers of the h,oard of education are
uiscussing me project.
In the will of the late Edward Hal
len, former, judge of probate and
member of the board of education,
$500 was left to the city to be used
as a fund for a memorial. , The board
awaited the completion of the new
High school "building 'before deciding
on the memorial. Although definite
action may not be taken at the meet
ing of the board, Monday evening, dis-
f cussion among the members indicates
that a Hallen section in the new High
school library is considered a most
fitting reminder of one jfof Bridgeport's
foremost proponents of education.
The Wheeler - Memorial is already
in the old High school. Alexander
Wheeler graduated from the High
school in the. early '90s. After1 his
death about 10 years ago, friends
arranged for a Memorial library,
which is the one now used in the old
High school building. This will be
transferred to the new building, ibut
while it fills the library in the old
huilding, it will occupy only about-one-third
of the space in the new.
Now, because of the great esteem f
in which the late Miss Margaret Som
erset, French teacher of the High
school, was held, an effort - is Jeing
made .to raise a fund for a Somerset
Memorial section in the library- In
dications are that the fund will be
raised soon-; Old graduates and pres
ent pupils of the High school, all of
-whom rev erred Miss Somerset and will
feel her loss keenly, are taking charge
of it. ... ..... -
Although nothing has .been- determ
ined, it-is likely that the Somerset
Memorial will be of French literature
and the, Hallen Memorial of technical
books. .,

Distinguished Member of Czar's Famliy in Bridge
port on Mission For Little White Father Rus
sian Government Opens Suite of Offices In
Heart of City, With Noted Army Officer In
Charge.
Discovery of the fact that in a -suite of magnificently ap
pointed offices in the First-Bridgeport National Bank building
there is ensconced a big staff of, Russian army officers-, and se
cret service men lead to startling disclosures of the activities of
agents of the Czar in Bridgeport.
Members of the Russian royal family, princes, dukes and
distinguished members of the Russian soldiery, are included in
the coterie of followers of the little white father who are here
on' official business.
Behind doors that bear no
largest office buildmg of the city is located one of the largest in-
formation offices ever opened in America by a foreign govern-'
ment.
Families of the Russian aristocracy have been established
here,, some of them incognito because of their desire to keep
their nlovements far from public scrutiny.
Throughout the entire rdty a Ttus-:
sian. espionage system is established
which has ramifications in every order
of - business, labor, educational and
social circles.
On Both Washington avenue and
Washington terrace families of the
Russian aristocracy army and navy
circles are established. v
On may believe that the First
Bridgeport . National Bank has many
vacant offices, because the doorways
no not display letting m DiacK ana
gold but the casual observer-will be
greatly fooled if he thinks so, for
many of these offices are occupied and
well furnished. As an example one
may follow any of, the plan looking
men of Russian type upon the streets,
distinguished by their black hair and
pointed beards. . As th'ey walk into the
big elevators and are whisked upward
J to the seventh flo or, their , appearance
would deceive.
As one walks through the doorways
of rooms 716. 717 or 718 presto! and
the situation is different' for with an
erect air General Zzeigler, hero of
many. campaigns in the Russian
Japanese war. may - stand erect and
the attention of many of the black
haired women or refined looking men
who are employed in this "informa
tion" office of the Russian government
will be directed with respect to his
presence as he disappears in , his
sumptuously furnished private office.
Likewise one may pass, the little
home at 110-112, Washington terrace,
where lives on the ground floor Wil
liam H. Harty, and not know- of the
magnificent interior of the upstairs
realm that has seen the presence, of
Colonel Collatoff, of the Russian army
if not, the Grand Duke Michael him
self. 'For in that home princes of the
Royal Russian blood harve stopped.
Others are likely to comport them
selves while on the streets of Bridge
port at least like ordinary citizens.
