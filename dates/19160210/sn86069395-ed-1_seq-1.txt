Russians Take Austrian Posts

ACTIONS ON BELGIAN FRONT
Optimism Over Outlook for Set
tlement of Lusitania
Controversy.
President Wilson and his cabinet
have studied Germany's latest pro
posal for a settlement of the American
government's demands concerning
tho sinking of the Lusitania. While
some alterations in the form of the
agreement, which will require its ref
erence to Berlin again, must be made,
they are regarded as minor ones, and
optimism prevails that in the near
future the controversy will be settled
amicably.
"Everything is substantially all
right, but it is not finished," was the
remark of Ambassador BernstorfF
after a conference with Secretary of
Slate Lansing on the situation.
The German ambassador has for
mally presented to the state depart
ment a communication from the Ber
lin foreign office claiming that the
British steamer Appam, recently tak
en into Hampton Roads by a German
prize crew, is entitled under the
Prussian-American treaty to remain
in American waters indefinitely.
The American government has an
nounced no decision in the matter.
Charged with having been con
nected with plots involving questions
of American neutrality the German
consul-general and vice-consul, and
the Turkish consul-general, in San
Francisco, have been indicted by a
federal grand jury.
Artillery actions between the
French and British and the Germans
continue at various pointson the
Franco-Belgian front, but there have
been no important changes in posi
tions anywhere. Nor have the Ger
mans yet begun the great offensive
for which they are reported to be
preparing.
Haavy fighting has broken out
again in East Galicia. All along the
front the artillery has been very ac
tive. The Russians succeeded north
of Tarnopol after repeated attacks in
penetrating the Austro-Hungarian ad-
vanccd infantry posts, but were
ejected from them later on, according
to Vienna.
In the Austro-Italian theater have
been only artillery duels. In the Bal
kans all is quiet. i
Austrian warships in the Adriatic
have ineffectually attempted to tor-1
pedo a British cruisor and a French
torpedo boat which were aiding the
Serbian army in its evacuation of the
Adriatic coast. A Teuton suamafinc
also attempted to sink two entente
allied vessels off Durazzo, but the
torpedoes missed their mark.

cannons, 7,700 military carriages and
3,000 machine guns have boon con
