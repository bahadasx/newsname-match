. THE LEGISLATURE,;
?
TO INCREASE WAREHOUSE FUND
?APPROPRIATIONS FOR PROHIBITION
AND MILITIA.
Columbia, February 4:?There ^
\ ? was something doing today on the ,
House side. Whether there is auy-1.
thing or not in the suggestion, the ,
ipi ' statement was openly made by Mr (
Bigham, of Aiken, and by Mr Smith, (
of Colleton, that there was an a{> j
| parent combination between the en- j
thusiastic militarists and promotion- ,
! ists, the one to get authority for \
r $25,000 with which, if necessary, to i
I pay for lost equipment, and the oth- ]
I er to place in the hands of the Gov- ,
ernor authority to expend as much ,
V 4as $50,000, if so much be necessary, ,
for the enforcement of the pro hi- \
I bition law. \
r The House refused to make a dik"
rect appropriation of $25,000 with
which to pay for lost equipment,
Whether there be anything in the sug- <
gestion of combination or not, it vot- '
ed authority for the money to be 1
borrowed with which to pay this 1
charge, if it could not otherwise be 1
arranged; and then the House voted 1
authorization of the $50,000 fund '
for the enforcement of the prohi- <
bition law. 1
I The two items were voted in the 1
shape of authority to borrow and '
ft not direct appropriations to be addB
ed to the sum total of the appro- <
priation bill. The item for the re- 1
B lief of the military was passed by '
ft vote of sixty-four to thirty, and the 1
authority for the borrowing of $50,- 1
I 000 for the enforcement of the prom
hibition law was adopted by a vote
of fifty-three to thirty-five.
K ' The fight came up on these amendr
ments of the appropriation bill, and
I the successful suggestion as to both
J matters came from Mr Wagnon, of
* * _
|| Union, an ardent prohibitionist, wno
| seems to know how to turn a trick.
[ The original proposition contained a
[ clause with reference to the use of
| rural police in various counties,
butethis was withdrawn after the
Gofernor was given the authority to
. use a law enforcement fund of
I $50,000.
WILL MAKE HISTORY.
The original bill by Mr Liles proposing
a direct appropriation of $500
000 for the enforcement of the pro|
hibition law remains unconsidered
? on the House Calendar. The fol1
lowing is the amendment to the pro?
hibition law which will make politi**
cal history in South Carolina:
| Section 41. Add at the end of Sec
" "n
Pf tion 41 the following: rroviueu
that measures pending in Congress
shall fail to relieve the militia of this
State of the charges now leveled
against the militia by the war deli
partmentin Washington, and provided
the Governor and Adjutant
1 General of the State shall have exft
tyausted all means to haye the war
B department relieve the militia of
B this State of said charge, and shall
be convinced that the charge is a
Hi *nst and honest obligation of the
State, then the Governor, the Comptroller
General and the State TreasW"1
urer be, and they are hereby, auH
' thorized and required to pledge the
ition,

:redit of the State for an amount $
not exceeding: twenty-five thousand ft
($25,000) dollars at such time as the ft
obligation must be discharged, and ft
pay and discharge the debt of the ft
militia to the war department: Pro- ft
/ided further, that shall the exigen- ft
:ies in any municipality or county in ft
-his State justify or require extra- ft
ordinary measures to enforce the ft
prohibition law now in force and ft
recently enacted, that the Governor ft
of the State may expend in his dis- ft
iretion fifty thousand ($50,000) dol- ft
? ? ? oo mov Ho s*>
ars, ur so iijuum uincui oo muj uv

ihall such funds be found necessary, ft
;he Governor, the Comptroller Gen- ft
iral and the State Treasurer shall ?
be, and they are hereby, empowered
and required, to pledge the credit
af the State at such time and for
juch amounts as may be necessary
lo enforce such laws, not to exceed
ifty thousand dollars ($50,000)."
THE WAREHOUSE COMMISSION.
The next most significant action
af the Assembly was in the direct
increase of the fund for the maintenance
of the State warehouse commissioner's
department from ten to
lfteen thousand dollars. Last night, _
tfhen it was proposed to take this
ncrease of five thousand dollars out
if the income of the warehouse sys- "I1
tem and to restrict the use of the uc
fund of this five thousand dollars in ^
addition to the direct appropriation, Se
Mr Belser and Mr Odom raised their
abjections. They were afraid that ^
any such restriction on the ware- ^
bouse commissioner might impair m
the system and not allow it sufficient m
money with which to pay insurance, vc
ront nnH nthpr eharcres. The House 1S^
today, without any objection on the I
part of the ways and means com- P?
mittee, raised the fund for the support
of the commissioner's department
to fifteen thousand dollars, and q(
it then adopted an amendment proposed
by Mr Odom, on the part of
the committee of agriculture, a pro- ^
viso that gives the commissioner
cc
ample latitude in the use of the
er
fund derived from the warehouse.
ai
This amendment reads as follows:
h<
That no section or provision of j
this act shall interfere with the holding
of the money received by the ^
State warehouse commissioner as a
separate fund in the Conduct of the ^
business, and this fund shall be at
the disposal of the commissioner in
the manner provided by an act en- ^
titled, an act to regulate the storage, ^
grading and marketing of cotton, ^
approved October 30, 1914, in ad- ^
dition to the appropriation made for j
the State warehouse commissioner.
PJ
That the time of the annual set- fa
tlement by the State warehouse to
commissioner with the State Treas- jn
urer and the Comptroller General is
hereby fixed as the first day of April ug
of each year. jj
