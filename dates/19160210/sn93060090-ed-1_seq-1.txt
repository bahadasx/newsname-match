an example to all such persons.
For it is a fact, that whenever j
we hear of something appear-1
antly new, we never stop until j
we make a thorough Investiga ,
tion. If the theory is about the
Bible especially; And if there is
any thing good in it, we then
will get the benefit of that good.
Acd if there is no good in it,
we then will be ready, and ab'e
to show to others without preju
dice or partiality that there is no
good in it, And our reason for
giving this lesson to our Readers
is this. For tbe last 30 years
we have represented the Two
Men Theory to the world, which
is Bible. And under any other
theory, the Bib'e cannot be un
derstood. And we have received
for our labor, the very bitterest
of persecution. And that too,
from the so called christian peo
ple, and from no other source,
And we know with the so call
ed preachers at tbe head, our
persecutors never stopped for
one moment, to investigate our
work or theory. Appearantly
all they wanted to know, was,
that it was different to what they
believed. And they could not.
nor cannot prove up their belief,
without having their belief, con
tradicted by the Word. And for
this reason we sa?, that if they
would have stopped, and made a
thorough investigation, they

What is it to deny onrselves,
and take up the cross and follow
Christ? we can only give the
life of Chrlsb-Jesua, iuorder to
give us, the priveledge of know
ing, just bow to deny ourselves
And to know just when we are
denying ourselves, Christ before
his advent to earth was with the
Father in heaven. He "was with
bim as one brought up with Him
and He was daily His delight.
There was no pleasure in hea
ven but whit Christ had access
to. But the time come, when
there must be a sacrifice paid.
And God called for a Volenteer
and Christ came forth and
said." here am I send Me."
please read.
"Also I heard tbe voice of the
denied himself. As we stated
above. Christ left all that was
near to bira and denied himself
of the glories of heaven, Sacrifi
cing self, inorder that his life
might be of tbe greatest of glory
to God a benefit to all men and
women who would be followers
of him. He did not only deny
himself but He suffered for the
sins of tbe whole world. Then
to be a close follower of Him
we must not only "Deny cur.,
selves, But we must be willing
to suffer, and not only for our
selves, but for others as well.
And when we become willing to
Deny ourselves, And suffer for
Christ's Cause, then we will be
gi n to do tbe will of God here
on earth as it is done by the
angels in heaven. And God then
will iustify us and save us,

Dear Bro. Garrett;
Here I am again, and I hope you are delighted
to see my dear initials again. While feeding the chickens lasb
night I had an inspiration, and for result of inspi ration, pleasa
read.
OH CRESSET! DEAR CRESSET!
Out to tbe winds dear Cresst blow,
To tell the world what it ought to know:
Heave high your blessed gospel page
Despite a mad world's seething rage;
Oh Cresset! Dear Cresset!
Out on the winds dear Ckesset soar,
What care we how the mad crowds roar ,
What care we if they do get sore?
Why, we'll only cheer and shout the more;
"Oh Cresset! Dear Cresset!
'Out to the wind-t dear Cresset fly
'To tell the world the reason why.
For days will come, and days will die,
And folks will weep, and folks will sigh.
Oh Cresset; Dear Cresset!
But still our Crsst dear will raise,
To a sinful world its snow white page;
And still the world will storm and rage
At the teachings of our dear old sa.ge,
Tbe Ed.! Dear Ed.!
To be continue.l) Yours in Peace and' Joy.
What do you think of it, Bro? C B. S.
IT IS GOOD.
P. s.
Honor to wbom, honor is due,
Is tbe motto, of our Friend.
Tne greatest life, man can per
sue,
His reward, will come in the end
"C hrist called his chosen, here
below,
"B"orn in a mangerof the beasts
"S"alvation from the stable show
Tbe initials truly are of the best.
