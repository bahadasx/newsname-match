SHANGHAI, China, Feb; 10. Re
publican troops won an Important vic
tory today in the Bard Ding district of
Szechuen. Yuan Shih-Kai'a soldiers
have been defeated in many engage
menta the last two weeks, but today,
made a last stand near Changking,
and after several hours retreated with
a large loss. The mocarchial soldiers
sent a despatch for help, but the tele
graph line .was cut by the Republican
forces. - -. ' '
. Republican troops have gained suc
cesses at points in Hunan and Sze
chuen, and the monarchiaf soldiers
have decreased in number, aa many
of them have been called upon to pro
tect Pekln from attack by the Mongo
lian division. Since Mukden has been
taken, Yuan Shih-Kal has withdrawn
one division of hia armv from that sec
; tlon and ordered it to defend Pekln
from tne Republican forces. u .
The United Statea minister at Pekin
has sent a member of the legation to
Yunnan and Szechuen to follow the
Republican troops and give informa
tion on the engagements being held
in that section. Military authorities
here, state that Wuchang and Peking

CLAIM HE SHOT ENEMY
AFTER BREAKING WINDOW
Had Made Threats to Kill, and
- Had Cuts on His Right Hand
When Taken After Duel
Yee Yo Kenk, Korean desperado,
who now is serving a prison sentence
of not less than Ave or more than 20
years for first degree robbery, may
ahortly be called Into Circuit Judge
Ashford's court to answer a charge of
first degree murder.
As a result of Investigations which
have .been .In progress since Yee Yo
Keuk was captured at daybreak on De
cember 9 after a running gun fight
with police 'and detectives, the city
and county attorney's omcsf Deneves
it now. baa sufficient evideace to war
rant an indictment by the territorial
grand jury charging the Korean with
first degree! murder, CItr Attorney A.
M. Brown said today. Thia evidence
has been slowly gathered, bit by bit,
by detectives, police and officials in
the attorney's office. r ' ' ".
The evidence! tends to link up Yee
Yo " Keuk with the murder of Chee
Wong- Yer a Korean, who was rent
collector for E. C. Winston, who was
found dead in his room in a tene
ment on the .morning that Yee was
cantured. ; i -
Window Glass Broken.
' The Korean had been shot. A jag
ged hole fn the window gave evidence
that the man' who had done the killing
had -thruat 'both ' hand and . revolver
tnrougo tne- giass ana urea, wnen
captured, Yee Yo KenlCs right hand
was found to be cut in several places.
s Other evidence is that, on one occa
sion,' Yee had threatened to kill Chee
Wong Yer on the ground that the lat
ter had ."tipped off" the police as to
the desperado's whereabouts. The
district ' attorney's , office . claims to
have other evidence linking Yee Yo
Kenk with the crime. , ; - ;.
. ' City Attorney , Brown stated con
clusively today that lie . will present
the case to the grand jury. A meet
ing of the tribunal will -be held at 2
o'clock tomorrow afternoon, but it is
not likely that the matter will be pre
sented at that time. It will probably
be submitted to the jury a week from
tomorrow, Mr. Brown says.
The penalty for first degree murder
is death, the court having no Alterna
tive. A prison -sentence cannot be
in flicted, , as In convictions of second
degree murder or manslaughter. . ,
