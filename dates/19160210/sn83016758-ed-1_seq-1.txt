COUNTY DADS MEET
Greenbush School Petition Dismissed
Number of Signatures Less
Than are Required by Law.
Other Matters of Interest Disposed of
Next Meeting to be Held
on .March 16, 1916.
The board of county commissioners
met in adjourned session at the office
of the county auditor Tuesday. All
members were present, and Chairman
Cater called the meeting- to order at
11 a. m.
The petition asking to have town
ship 41, range 27, set off from the
town of Onamia, to which it is now at
tached for township purposes, came on
for final hearing-, and it was rejected
on the grounds that it did not have
the necessary 25 legal signers.
Two school petitions were presented
to the board, one from Nels M. Olson
on Milaca town, asking to have his
lands set off from district 29 and at
tached to district 31, and the other
from Thomas Hunt of Page asking
that his lands be set off from district
27 and attached to district 43. Date of
hearing on the petitions was set for
March 16 at 2 p. m.
In the matter of appointing a coun
ty physician but one bid was submit
ted to the board, that being by Dr.
H. P. Bacon of Milaca who agreed to
perform the duties for a compensa
tion of $200 for the year. The bid did
not include supplying the necessary
medicines. The bid was, upon motion,
accepted and the bond of said county
physician was fixed in the sum of $500.
The petition praying for a division
of school district 4, Greenbush, came
on for final hearing, and so many in
terested individuals were on hand that
the board decided to adjourn to the
court room upstairs while the matter
was being considered. Attorney E. L.
McMillan appeared for the opponents
of the proposed division, and Former
Commissioner Uglem acted as spokes
man for the petitioners. It was shown
that the petition did not contain the
signatures of a majority of the free
holders of the territory involved, as is
required by law before a division can
be made, consequently the petition was
^dismissed. It appears that some of
those who had signed the petition lat
er signed a remonstrance, thus nulli
fying their first signatures. There is
now talk of the district making a state
loan for the purpose of erecting a new
school house in the east end of the
district where a majority of the peti
tioners reside.
The board instructed County Audi
tor Doane to advertise for bids for a
steel and concrete bridge to span Estes
Brook on the main Princeton and Mil
aca road.
An agreement was entered into
whereby Mille Lacs county will have
the services of M. J. Cleveland as
highway engineer jointly with Benton
county the coming year. The two
counties involved will pay his salary
for six months, and the state highway
commission is to reimburse him for
his time the other six months.
Numerous tax matters were dis
posed of, and after acting on a grist
of bills the commissioners adjourned.
The next meeting will be held on Jan
uary 16.
Base Ball Banquet.
A base ball banquet that is different
s-will be held at the I. O. O. F. hall next
Thursday evening, February 17, and
it promises to be an enjoyable affair.
It will be different in that none of the
usual devices to separate a slice of the
coin of the realm from those in attend
ance will be resorted to. No season
tickets will be hawked, no subscrip
tion lists will be circulated and anyone
can attend without feeling the slight
est misgiving. The boys desire to
make it merely a get-together meet
ing.
Last year the first banquet of this
sort in Princeton was held and it
proved such a decided success that
those in attendance were unanimously
of the opinion that it should be made
an annual event. It has now become
-a fixture as permanent as the ball
team.
The doors will be open at 7 o'clock,
and as a preliminary to the "feed" the
various champion Sixty-Six, Pitch,
and Norwegian Whist players of the
village will be afforded an opportunity
to engage in contests of talent, in
genuity and luck. No one will be
barred, and those who question
whether they can qualify as champions
if there be anyare welcome to
participate.
At 9 o'clock those fortunate enough
to be possessed of the proper creden-
35 mAwm^Wwt
Minn. Historical Society
tials will seat themselves at the dining
tables at which time the banquet
proper will start, and it is certain
that viands will be there in abundance.
Attorney E. L. McMillan will preside
as toastmaster, and a flow of wit will
follow'. Such well known after-dinner
speakers as Mayor Newbert, "Hienie"
Plaas of poetic fame, W. C. Doane, S.
P. Skahen and various other local cel
ebreties will be present, which means
that an intellectual treat is in store
for those in attendance.
The base ball boys always do things
up right, on the diamond and else
where, consequently the success of the
coming banquet is assured.
Good Roads Day Contest.
In Anoka county last year there was
quite a competition among the several
towns of the county as to which would
construct the longest stretch of good
road on Good Roads Day, the third
Tuesday of June, and purses of $250,
$150 and $100 were offered as prizes
to the towns, and as a result several
pieces of good roads were completed
on that day. Already the Herald is
urging that the same arrangement
should be continued this year. The
county commissioners appropriate the
money for the prizes from the county
road and bridge fund, and the prize
money is expended on the roads of the
winning towns. It is a good scheme
and the Union would like' to see such
a contest among the towns of this
county. In any event a concerted ef
fort should be made this year to ac
complish something out of the ordin
ary in the way of road improvement
by volunteer labor on Good Roads
Day, which falls on June 20 this yea*
Indrehus Made Good.
Representative Indrehus of Benton
county will be a candidate for re-elec
tion to the house. He was an excel
lent member, and did most effective
work not only for his district but for
the whole state. Great credit is due
him for his support of the Sullivan
material bill, which makes it manda
tory on the board of control to use
Minnesota material in the construc
tion of public buildings, and it was
because of his good work in the house
that the new historical building will
be made of Sauk Rapids granite. This
is only one of the many good things
he did for Minnesota. With the ex
perience of one term he will be of
greater aid to his people if re-elected,
and we believe his services are so
well appreciated by the citizens of
Benton county that he will be return
ed without opposition. When you get
a good man, it is an excellent plan to
show your appreciation in a practical
way, and Indrehus certainly made
good.St. Cloud Journal-Press.
School Privileges of Indian Children.
The following communication re
ceived by County Superintendent Ew
ing from State Superintendent of Ed
ucation Schulz, pertains to the Cove
school, and is self-explanatory:
"I have your letter of the 3rd, rela
tive to the Indian children in District
No. 17.
"There is nothing that we can add
to what we have already stated in
previous letters, Indians who are resi
dents of a school district, and who are
not wards of the federal government,
are entitled to the school privileges of
that district. It would not be compe
tent for the people to exclude children
who are legally entitled to attend
school, by taking action at a special
meeting against admitting them.
"The district is under obligation to
provide for the education of those
children unless they are in such a
condition that they can be excluded
from school because of unfitness and
being a danger and a menace to the
other children."
Pay-Up Week.
Feb. 21-26 is National Pay-Up week.
The Aitkin papers contain page ad
vertisements made up of cards from
the business houfces and banks of
which the following is a sample:
"Credit is the Life of Business. Prompt
Pay Makes Your Credit Good.First
National Bank of Aitkin."
Let us inaugurate a Pay-Up Week
in Princeton. Let everybody make an
effort to pay his debts on the week
of Feb. 21-26.
New Kindergarten Class.
A kindergarten class will be form
ed to start school on March 6. Only a
limited number of children will be en
rolled in this class, and they will be
received strictly in accordance with
their ages. Those having children
whom they desire to enter in this be
ginners' class should at once leave
names and ages of such with Miss
Tompkins at the Whittier school.

FOR FAIR BUILDING
Program to be Given By Princeton
Schools at the Armory on Fri-
day Evening February 25.
Proceeds to go to Fund for Erection
of School Exhibit Building at
the Fair Grounds Here.
A Washington Lincoln program
will be given by the Princeton schools
at the Armory on Friday evening,
February 25, the proceeds of which
will go to the fund for the erection
of a school exhibit building at the
fair grounds. It is a worthy cause,
and a large attendance is desired* but
the public is not urged to support the
project as a matter of charitythe
program is a pleasing one, and will be
well worth the moderate admission
fee asked. The rural schools of the
county have contributed to the fund
quite generously, and Princeton should
make as good a showing as possible.
The grades and high school will
participate in the program, and the
teachers and pupils have been for
the past few weeks laboring to make
the affair a success, and are still at it.
We have no doubt but what success
will crown their efforts.
The program will open with a selec
tion by the orchestra, and songs, reci
tations, drills and a cantata will fol
low. The program appears here

An Important Industry.
The Milaca Times figures it out that
$419,259.78 was paid to patrons of the
creameries located in the six southern
towns of Mille Lacs county during the
year 1915. We think the figures are
too low. The Times errs in the amount
paid to patrons by the Princeton
creamerythe correct amount was
$75,363.93 instead of $54,777. More
than half the patrons of the Glendo
rado creamery, which is located just
across the line in Benton county, are
Greenbush farmers. It is safe to say
that the total amount paid to Mille
Lacs county farmers for cream during
the year 1915 exceeds $500,000. That
is a splendid showing for an industry
which is yet in its infancy. Twenty
five years hence when the northern
part of the county is developed, more
than $1,000,000 will be paid out an
nually for cream to the farmers of
Mille Lacs county.
An Aitkin Road Project.
This month the county commission
ers of Aitkin county are to act on a
petition for a state rural highway
running north and south through the
county, commencing at a point about
six miles east of Redtop on the county
line, from thence almost due north to
the village of McGregor and then
north and east to the north line of the
county. The estimated cost is about
$200,000, and the distance to be cov
ered is 65 miles. A majority of the
commissioners are said to be in favor
of this big road project and it will un
doubtedly be pushed to completion and
will give Aitkin county people a direct
wagon and auto road to the Twin Cities.
AN INACTIVEMARKET
Local and Outside Potato Movement
Is Quiet Due to Cold Wave
and Heavy Snow.
Embargo on Spuds from Ireland May
Be LiftedVirginia Potato
Planting Season Opens.
The local potato market has been
calm and quiet the past week, th cold
weather having made the marketing of
spuds practically impossible. The first
activity for a couple of weeks, came
with the moderated temperature of
Tuesday and yesterday. Prices have
remained substantially the same as
last week.
A light movement of potatoes is re
ported from Chicago and other out
side points, but the market maintained
a steady tone last week. Inquiry for
seed potatoes is begining to develop,
and orders for same are arriving
at Chicago. An active trade is antic
ipated from now on. The Packer re
ports that holdings of Triumphs, Cob
blers and Rose are light, as the crop
this season was short, and it is un
derstood that the supply of Ohios is
also falling behind, inasmuch as a
good many have been shipped for
table stock.
New York stocks are heavy but the
market is firm, although many car
loads from Maine have been turned
down by unreliable buyers.
The potato planting season has
opened in Virginia, but the indications
are that the acreage in early pota
toes will not exceed 80 per cent of last
year's acreage. Potato growers there
have for many years depended upon
potash to pull the crop through. Pot
ash is scarce, and they are afraid to
risk high priced seed without it.
Information received at New York
from the Federal Horticulture Board
at Washington, D. C, is to the effect
that an investigation is now being
made to determine whether the em
bargo shall be raised on potatoes from
Ireland. At the present time the
quarantine on European potatoes still
holds on account of the wart disease
in +hose countries. The federal board
has been informed that there are ter
ritories in Ireland where this disease
does not exist and the board is of the
opinion that if it is possible to allow
potatoes to come into America from
those districts it will do so. In this
connection the following cablegram re
ceived by a Boston potato broker from
one of the largest potato houses in
Great Britian is interesting:
"In Scotland we have plenty of
potatoes but in the event of shipping
great difficulty would arise in get
ting potatoes to carry. The class of
potatoes shipped some years ago have
deteriorated and another variety
would have to be tried. In the event
of business opening up between the
two countries, we would require a
good price as our markets are at
good value and expenses are about
doubled, owing to the war."
The authorities recognize the inter
est farmers and dealers have in the
matter of foreign importations and
say that if anything is done in the
near future it will be given out im
mediately for publication in the press.
Peter Robideau.
Peter Robideau, a former resident of
this vicinity, and a brother of Louis
Robideau of Greenbush, answered the
final summons at his home in Idaho
a couple of weeks ago.
Deceased came to Mille Lacs county
in 1867 with his parents, and resided
here up to 19 years ago when he went
west. For a number of years he acted
as superintendent of a planing mill
at Kootenai, Idaho. For the last five
years he was a resident of Spokane
and St. Joe, Idaho. Mr. Robideau is
survived by a wife and nine children,
Mrs. F. P. LaBarre of Spokane, B. H.

The Man Worth While.
The man who is really worth while,
it seems to us, is the man who pays
his bills as he goes, treats his family
and his friends fairly and squarely
and is above board with all mankind.
He puts a curb on his tongue, and
keeps his hands busy with good deeds:
he refrains from petty and malicious
gossip and spreads the gospel of good
fellowship. Such a man, as we have
depicted above, may never achieve
ncccoTiwc DAftr
great fame, but he is sure to win a
niche in the hearts of all who know
him. He may never get his picture in
the papers, but his memory will al
ways be a thing to cherish, and when
he has quitted this life and his soul
has departed for that mysterious re
gion unknown, his friends may well
and truly say of him: "He was a
man!" No better praise, no better
epitaph need be given or written.

The pupils of the high school read
with much interest the notice posted
on the school house door this week
calling for an election on February

ing vote there is no question as to
what the result of the vote would be.
During the last eight years Princeton
has turnd out exactly 132 graduates
from the high school. These are now
scattered all over the United States,
even from Los Angeles to Boston, and
so far as we know every one is mak

thirty boys and girls. We have this
year in the high school department an
enrollment of about 190 and every one
of them is a loyal rooter for the

CAPITOLJCANDAL
R. C. Pickit, a Clerk in the State Audi-
tor's Office, and State Treas-
urer Smith Involved.
Forgeries to the Amount of $28,962
DiscoveredThe State Will
Suffer No Loss, However.
There was a sensation in the state
capitol on Monday when it was dis
covered that the investment clerk in
the State Auditor's office, R. C. Pickit,
had forged a school treasurer's name
to an $18,000 warrant, and that the
warrant had been cashed by State
Treasurer Smith more than six months
ago. Pickit confessed ro other forger
ies which brought the total amount up
to $28,962. Pickit is under arrest in
St. Paul, and detectives are guarding
Treasvirer Smith in a Minneapolis
sanatorium. The money has been re
funded to the state by Pickit and
Smith or their friends.
Treasurer Smith has not fully told
his story yet. Pickit in his confes
sion to County Attorney O'Brien and
State Auditor Preus implicates the
state treasurer. Mr. Smith should not
be condemned unheard, but it would
be utterly impossible for Pickit to
have carried out his schemes without
the connivance of the state treasurer
or some other person in authority in
that office.
The first forgery perpetrated by
Pickit was as far back as 1913 and
was for $4,200. The loan was for a
school district in St. Louis county. Af
ter the application for the loan had
been approved it was afterwards can
celled by the investment board, never
theless it seems Pickit was successful
in having an auditor's warrant for
$4,200 issued, forged the indorsement
of the school treasurer to the back of
the warrant and had the same cashed
by the state treasurer. We can well
see how a trusted clerk like Pickit
could deceive the auditor or his deputy,
but what business had the state treas
urer to cash the warrant The treas
urer of the school district in question,
and not R. C. Pickit, was the party to
whom the state treasurer should baxe
issued his check.
The $18,000 warrant was issued un
der different circumstances. In that
case it was the name of an Aitkin
county school treasurer that was
forged. Again Pickit succeeded in hav
ing an auditor's warrant issued by
deputy auditor C. S. Brown (there is
not a dishonest hair in Claud Brown's
head), and the state treasurer again
cashed the sameor issued a check
which was deposited in a Biwabik
bank. Mr. Smith's explanation of the
transaction is not very lucid.
There were other smaller forgeries
perpetrated by Pickit, to which he has
confessed. But as far as known resti
tution has been made and the state will
suffer no loss. Restitution, however,
will not save the guilty party or par
ties from criminal prosecution.
Onamia Adopts Australian System.
In the last issue of the Onamia
Lake Breeze appeared an ordinance
recently adopted by the common coun
cil providing that elections of village
officers in that village shall hereafter
be held and conducted under the so
called Australian ballot system.
Under the ordinance all candidates
for village offices must file an affidavit
at least one wreek
prior to the election,
with the village recorder. The affi
davit shall be substantially as provid
ed by Chapter 2 of the Laws of 1912,
relating to nonpartisan offices. The
council fixed the filing fee in the sum
of $1.00. No party designation will
appear on the ballots, and the names
of the candidates for each office will
be arranged in alphabetical order. The
system should prove an improvement.
Mistaken Identity.
That it sometimes takes a long
time for a good story to get to the
place it originated but the whirlgig
of time brings these things about in
its own peculiar way. During the
holidays one of the teachers employed
in the primary grades who is very
fond of her pupils, met a gentleman
on the train. She thought she recog
nized him and crossed the isle of the
coach and remarked, "Oh, Mr.
I see you are traveling, too." The man
looked dazed and in a moment she
discovered her mistake. "I beg your
pardon," she hurriedly exclaimed. "I
thought you were the father of one of
my children." And the joke of it all
was, the dear girl never, never, did
find out why the passengers laughed
when the youngs man turned scarlet.
