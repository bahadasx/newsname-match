New York. Feb. ?.?The entire manu
facturina resources of the country have
txen mobolizetl ?o that they can ba In
stantly taken orer by the government In
eauu of war.
American torpedoes have been Im
prov-ed until now they are superior to the
torpedoes of any other nower on earth.
Plana have be*n perfected for a physi
cal and chemical laboratory In which. J
?mon;* other things, submarine engines
can be built in six day?.
Confidential designs of new forelsn
lighting craft hav? been secured, con?
taining features not yet ueeU by the
l*n!te.i States.
I.rral Machine? Poaalble.
Aeroplane eniines have been improve? j
?o that machine? never before -constructed |
here can now be built.
Th**?e concrete achievements were |
pla?-ed by the various ?ummltteea before I
the Na?. al a?lv?iory board at Ita meet- r
ine in rhe Brooklyn Navy Yard today.
They represent th?* activities of mfmbera .
of the >?o?trri since its last session.
The meeting was an executive one.'
Thomas A. Edison presided. The lat- !
ter presented to the board plans for a ;
nei laboratory. The plans are com
p'?-t- In every defaH. and if passed hf '
Con press eventually will mean the
. ?? ? ; ?ictioii of twenty-three building?. |
Tt*?? acope of this laboratory ts to j
ct in on?? I'alf the present cost of ?
constructing naval vessel?.
?faa Have Tl-ase.
Immediately after the session. Mr.
???.??? ?aid:
That laboratory is big enough to
h'lild anything up to a submarine. If
they adopt my methods of workln?.
there is hardly anything they cannot
build within sixty days.
"For Instance, take the engine for
a submarine. Under the old way it
took flre months to build lt. Here we
will put J00 men on lt. Each man will
have a part in the work which can be
done In from 70 to SO hours. We will
put the whole thing together and have
lt running in six days.
"The laboratory is planned for quick
result?. As an illustration. I was told
by one admiral that he had a specially
de?lgned gun carriage that he wished to
be built It arms a year before he got It.
From hts description I believe that the
laboratory could have built it in
?eventy-two hours.
I ?,?? -r.ai Tool?.
"There will be universal tools in the
laboratory, ?o that an individual can do
an individual act expedltiously.
"The laboratory will cost about S1.500,
0W for the preliminary work. The ulti
mate cost will be four of five million?.
Mr. Kdiaon ?aid that Howard CotTIn
had got all the papers from every manu
facturer In the l'nited States mobilizing
everything to make ammunition ln case
of war.
"Wc know every tool In the L'nited
States that can be used to make am
munition." he said.
It ivas pointed out hy members of the
board that with the laboratory In ex
istence, the manufacturer would be saved
the trouble of designing. It would alao
eliminate waate of time, and delays in
construction, when new features did not
prove ?ucceieful.
