Clifford Thome Appeals to
Judiciarv Sub-Commit-tee
of Senate ot to Re
commend Confirmation of
Nomination to Bench
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Feii. 9 Charging
that Louis "D. Brandeis, as counsel for
the interstate commerce commission
in the 5 per cent advance rate case,
conceded to the cause of the rail
loads to the fatal injury of the pub
lic interest, Clifford Thome, railroad
commissioner of Iowa and an asso
ciate counsel in the rate case, ap
pealed to the judiciary sub-committee
of the senate tonight not to recom
mend confirmation of Mr. Brandeis'
nomination to the supreme court of
the Fnited States.
Mr. Thorne argued that it would be
very costly to the American people
to put men on the supreme court
bench with preconceived notions as
to high returns on railroad invest
ments in view of the fact that ques
tions involved in the national ap
praisement of railroads now going on
ultimately wculd have to be deter
mined by that tribunal. Summing up
his case, he declared:
"I have shown conclusively from the
records that Mr. Brandeis has com
mitted himself to the proposition that
a return on the capital stock of rail-
) fiau't oi i yz pel vein is, lu uae ma
own words, rather niggardly.
"That is the return which the in
terstate commerce commission unani
mously determined was adequate.
Further, the investors of this country
have decided that a stock yielding 7'
per cent in the market places of the
country is worth 100 cents on the dol
lar. I have repeatedly challenged any
one to name a security which earns
trat amount that does not command
par or above par.
"The other proposition which I
have attempted to show is entirely
independent of the merits of the rate
cose and whether Mr. Brandeis was
right or wrong in his position as to
tne adequacy of railroad revenue. The
other proposition related to a matter
of professional ethics. I have shown
you that Mr. Brandeis was employed
by the interestate commerce commis
sion with, specific instructions not to
advocate any particular theory as to
the disposition of the case. He was
asked if he was willing to take the
burden of seeing that the other side
ol the ca;'e was developed, and told
that the railioad side would be ade
quately cared for. I have tried to
show that Mr. Brandeis had expressed
the greatest of confidence in the pre
sentation of the rate case by asso
ciate counsel.
"I have shown that Mr. Brandeis
co-operated in a friendly manner dur
ing the conduct of the case while as
sociate counsel, yet, at the crucial
time, Mr. Brandeis, without warning
to other counsel, after all argument
i had been closed, conceded entirely to
tl)e railroaus. Had I known that such
was ROing to he his position; had he
advised us of his decision, steps cer
tainly would have been taken for our
1 rotection. and we would have- de
manded an opportunity to be heard
fter Mr. Brandeis had closed the ar
gument for the public.
"Coming from Mr. Brandeis, who
participated with us in cross-examination
during the rate case and who
was employed by the interstate com
merce commission, I consider that his

HARBOR COLLISIONS
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 9. In order
to deal directly with the owners of the
vessels violating navigation laws in
San Francisco bay, John O. Davis, col
lector of the port, announced today
that he had assumed jurisdiction of the
navigable waters of the bay, and that
he would ask the opinion of the United
States district attorney as to the legil
ity of his stand.
The action was takfn ns, an after
math of the recent collision between
the turbiner Harvard and the steam
schooner Excelsior, in which the latter
was wrecked. The United States in
spectors of steam vessels here con
tended that their jurisdiction in cases
of iccidents, extended only- to the li
censed officers and that after they had
been disciplined, their functions
ceared. '

OPPONENTS OF PLANS
FOR DEFENSE LA WS ARE
HEARD BY COMMITTEE
While Xot Unanimous as to
What Should Be Done or
Left Undone, All Oppose
Any Present Change in
Military Policv
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9. Opponents
of administration plans for defense leg
islation concluded their "day in court"
today before the house military com
mittee, and while not unanimous in
their opinions as to what should be
done or left undone with regard to
the army and navy, they all opposed
any present change in military policy.
Representatives of the Society of
Friends and a score of others, speak
ing under the auspices of the Wo
men's Peace Party, discussed war and
its causes and consequences from
many angles. They were seldom in
terrupted by committee members ex
cept where the open minuedness of
congress on the subject of prepared
ness was assailed.
Among those who spoke were Wal
ter Fisher of Chicago, former secre
tary of the interior; Osward Garrison
Villard, president of the New York
Evening J'os-t; The Rev. John Mc-
Cracken, chancellor emiritus of the
University of New York; Samuel B. military committee to hasten prepara

and Frederick Howe New Yoik state
immigration commissioner, and the
Rev. Frank Hall, of New York, speak- j
ing for the celrgy of all denominations
of that city.
The views rxtirpK.-d ransred from '
suggestions that congress should await j
the conclusion of the European war to
profit by lessons it might ic-ach, to
declarations against a policy of mili
tary preparedness at any time or for
any purpose.
A majority of the speakr
even the '
women, disclaimed any sympathy with !
Villard prefaced his remarks with the
tious he would wear .hat designation,
us a badge of honor. i
"If it means to believe," he said,!
"that there is no cause leading up to
war, which canot lie composed and ad
justed by internal tribunes precisely as
the quarrels of individuals are vindi
cated, then I would be willing to have
the stigma of a peace at any price man
attached to me and shall wear it as a
distinction."
Mr. Fisher aroused the resentment
of some members of the committee
when he declared that under a genera!
order of the war department, army of
ficers had been gagged and t:i" views
presented to the committee by staff
ficers did not reflect the 'oplnicn.s of
many officers of the line. He ';a. i sev
eral officers of his acquaintance had
declared themselves opposed to any
great military increase plan but all
feared to express their real views be
cause of the "gag order." Representa
tive Kahn called attention to the state
ment of Secretary Garrison to the com
mittee that officers were "free as air"
to express their personal views.
Mr. Montgomery said he spoke for
500,000 mine workers who had de
clared against preparedness. He ad
mitted that he and other officers of
the organization had believed it would
! be impossible for their side to get a
! fair hearing, and added that he had
been surprised at the kindly recep-

controlled by munition makers and
armor interests, and the opposition to
their proposals was denied a hear
ing. He added that laibor was not
opposed to the national guard in
states where it was not controlled
by the employers and filled with
"gun and billy men" to trample on
labor's rights.
Mr. Villard urged that the army be
reduced to the status of police it oc
cupied in 1895. Adequate prepared
ness was a will-o-the-wisp, he said,
and could not be obtained under any
plan proposed short of conscription
and the military domination known
in Germany and which had led to
tho moral ruin of that country.
"How about an attack by Ger
many, France and Japan," he said,
"at tho same time? Can you arm

The French and Germans have

the road running from Neville to The-

by
the federal veterinarian. Thcv
must also submit to the scrutiny of
a state official, who will make a rec-
j ord of all brands and marks. The
latter precaution is taken for the pur
pose of keeping tab on all animals en-
tering the state, so that in case a
. herd, subsequent to its entrance, is
j reported to be infected with some
pest, it can be located and segregated
so as to prevent the spread of the
malady.
At the present time there is no' im
port duty on livestock and hides com
ing into the United States from Mex
ico. The Mexican authorities, how
ever, collect an export duty on all
outgoing herds. The Carranzists will
be the only ones to profit financially
from the movement of the herds from
one country into the other.
The resolution of the sanitary board
nullifying the quarantine enactment
will be forwarded to Governor Hunt
today and he will in a few days issue
a proclamation calling attention to
the fact that the embargo has been
removed.
