HUGHES DENIES KNOWLEDGE OF EFFORTS
VVamiinuto.v, l'eh. ft. Cli.nles K.
Hiishe?. Annoelatc Justice of the tiw
prt'inc Court, Issued another disclaimer
ln.tl.iy. The Justice In n letter to Hep
rescntallu Sletnii of Vlrslma, Hepubll
can .State chairman, said :
1 inn entirely out of politics and 1
Know nothing whatever of the matters
to w hlch you refer.
These matters were the alleged ac
tivity In Virginia of an organization of
former ollli eholden and friends of
Trank llltclutick In behalf of .Mr.
IIUKhes for the Hi publican nomlna
thin. I am totally opimsed to the uc of
my name In connection wllh the nomi
nation and selection or InMructlon of
any tleleKatt'H In my lnteret, either
directly or indirectly.
Tho letter 'from Justice Hughe was
called out by one from Mr. Slemp. On
receiving the letter from the Justice,
Mr. i-lenip wiote to ask if Mr. 1 lushes
objucted to the correspondence belns
made public, lie received a teply from
the vecrctnry of Mr. llUKhes saying
that the Jurist did not object to the
publication. Thereupon .Mr. cmp Kave
out the letters and a "tatens-nt of sonic
significance, as politicians view It hete.
Itlu: lleintttitl for I'tipleN,
There was i ureat tleniand for coplen
of the correspondence by Hepubllcans In
I'oiiKiess, and when obtained. It was
read with ureal e.iKcrness.
"The situation Is unclianneil," s.tltl
one of the most prominent of Western
Itepubllcan Senators. "Justice HtiKhes
tines not say he will not accept If
nominated,"
Hut the most slKnlilcant feature of the
disclosure made by Itepresvutatlve Slemp
In tho opinion of many Itrpuhllcans was
as to the activity of Frank II. Hitch
took, ex-chalrin.tn of the Hepuhllcan
National Oommlttee, who has been heard
from In many States recently working
for llUKhes.
Tho statement Riven out by Mr.
Slfuip alleves that an organization has
been formed In New York to nominate
Justice Hughes and that I'.nv. Whitman
is directing It. and that the tlovernor gol
out of the race in the Interest of Justio
Hughes's candidacy. If the confident
claims put forward by the men who arc
leported to be working for Hughes tan
lie relied on the Chicago convention will
meet simply to ratify tlie nomination of
Hughes a.d Mr. Hitchcock will take
i iiarge of the campaign and later dis
pense patronage. That was tlie thing
tint interested the Itepubllcan politi
cians. Will lliivr lii lie Mrnimcr.
Justice HtlKhe-'s letter was brief. It
required fewer than Hfty words for him
to state the case. It Is evident that Jus
tic Hughes will have to go furtTier than
lie did to-d.iy to close the door of high
political opportunity that appears to
swing oneii so frequently and m per
sistently to him, in the opinion of the
politicians.
The Hughes liu'lilei.t was dlcuss,.il
from many angles to-day. The ugges.

The correspondence made public by Mr.

written In S. Ilrown Allen, it political
enemy of Mr Slemp lu Virginia, which
found Its way Into tlie li.tnds of tlie
member. This letur follows: I
The letter of S. Ilrown Allen, which
fell Into Slentp's I in ruin. Is as follows:
"I am it little late getting Into the

before ou, because the national Ilepub.
Hem leaders themselves only got to
gether a week or tell das ago In New
Yolk mid launched their tight for the i
Presalency for Charles K. Hughes. The
first Intimation I had of It was when I
learned tlitough the papers that C.ov.
Whitman announced his withdrawal of I
Ids candidacy for the Presidency mid
asked to lie placed at the head of the
New York delegation to Chicago as one
of the delegates at large.
"I knew theie was something doing,
but pretty soon after our old friend. 1".

railed me tip nnil salt! Mr. Hitchcock
had advi-ed him to get In totii h with
me at the earliest possible moment and
that he wanted me to come to Itlchmnnd
early the next morning, which I did
"Mr. Cabell laid before nie the cam

"The nirangenieni is not to antagonize
Itposevelt, because It will surely be

ot the next Administration. He will be
made at Chicago chairman of the Na

will he in lull charge of the campaign

"This combination will sweep the coun

can be. The fact and ttuth Is Mr. Hitch
cock told me f.sterday over the phone
that ucce of the movement Is practi

that the persons who assume to speak
