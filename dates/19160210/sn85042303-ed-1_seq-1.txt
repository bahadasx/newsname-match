east bank of the Pvina. seven miles
iiorthwes of Dvinsk. This would ap-,
pear to indicate a serious penetration
of flic Russian lines.
The Russian staff, however, ex
plains that the German forces, al
though unable to advance from their
old positions, succeeded in reaching
Likann by using heavy artillery, which
they now have had time to mount.
Little importance therefore is at
tached in these circles to the per
sistent predictions of a great German
offensive against Riga and Dvinsk in
March, since Russian military men
l ave been convinced by the failure
of Yon Hindenburg's last efforts to
take Dvinsk that even tinder condi
tions most favorable to the Germans
the Dvinsk-Rigi line is impregnable.

OR APRIL
ALL ARDMORE MERCHANTS ARE
WORKING AS ONE MAN TO
MAKE THE OCCASION A BRIL
LIANT SUCCESS.
At a special meeting of the Busi
ness Men's association at their head
quarters in file opera house last night
it was definitely il'-cided to inaugu
rate a "fashion" night and grand
united spring opening for Ardmore
during the month of April.
Nearly every member of the asso
ciation was present and all were en
thusiastic over th proposition, as
tentatively outlined by Secretary Gil
bert. That the occasion should be made
one of th- most elaborate and res
plendent ever held in the city was
definitely decided on, and the most
thorough and widespread campaign
to advertise the event is to be con
ducted. The meeiinu was presided over by
Dave Dailbe, chairman of the board
of directors and every line of busi
ness represented gave expression to
the belief that, it would be a great
progressive move and fully establish
Ardmore's statu.-! to compete with
any retail center in the slate. Kvery
merchant, big and little. In the city
will be invited to participate.
Anions the features discussed were
window display contests, display con
tests, refunding of railroad fares to
...ii
out-of-town shoppers, ami toe i-Mnuj
of the advertising campaign.
It was decided to leave the formtl-j
la'ion of the plan of procedure to the
board of :irectors, which meets to
night at the office of Kennerly, Sprag- j
ins & Lewis, to make out an cxat t
line of procedure and report back at '
