Cookeville's Great Day
Magnificent United States Post
Office and Courthouse Thrown
Open.
Wednesday night of Febru
ary 9, 1916, marks a mile post
ia the growth vt Cookeville,
. for on that date occurred the
greatest single event ever hav
pening in our thriving city
the opening of our magnifi
cent United States post office
" and court house.
Superintending Architect,
Claude E. Parker conceived the
idea of having a public recep
tion and informal dedication of
the building and under his ef
ficient guidance every detail of
the happy event was carried
to a remarkably successful con
clusion. At the announced opening
hour a great throng of people
filled the street waiting for the
doors to open, every one of
them anxious to show their ap
preciation for the great build
ing and the opportunity to in
spect it, From the moment of
admission until the close of
the services the building was
literally packed with happy hu
mans from the basement to the
top floor, and hundreds went
away without being able to get
in. . It was some crowd and
everybody knows what our
people think of our newest
public building.
-Promptly at 8 o'clock the
services were begun In the
court room. Mayor O. K. Hol-
' laday presided in his usual
happy and capable way. ,
After an invocation by Rev,
R. J. Crafg the speakers of the
evening were introduced in the
following order:
Former United States Sena
tor Jas. B. Frazier, who secur
ed the passage of the bill thru
the Senate creating the Court
and authorizing the erection of
the Cookeville building Dis
trict Attorney Lee Douglass,
Marshal Jonas Amis, State
Senator John J. Gore, Rutledge
Smith, E. L. Wirt, John B. Dow
and C. E; Parker.
Each speaker arose to the oc
casion ana , meir efforts were
received by hearty responses
from the audience. '
Telegrams of regret were
read from Judge E. T. San
ford Coneressman Cordell
Hull, Collector E. B. Craig and
' Postmaster E. S. Shannon of
Nashville, who could not . be
present
Following the speaking Ja3
N. Cox took the floor and In a
neat speech presented Mr. Par
ker, the architect in charge of
construction, a handsome sterl
ing silver loving cup as a slight
memorial of the love and es
teem of our citizens. Mr. Par
ker had never received any in
timation of what was coming
and when the secret came out
it nearly "got his goat." He
accepted the gift in a few well
chosen words.
The exercises over the throng
of happy citizens departed for
their homes, to sleep and dream

1 Cheering Someone On
2 ' Don't you mind about the triumphs
J Don't yo.u worry after fame;
' Don't you grieve about succeeding,
I Let the future guard your name.
All the best in life's the simplest,
Love will last when wealth is gone;
X Just be glad that you are living,
t And keep cheering someone on.
Let vour neiehbors have the hlnKsnms
2. Let your comrades wear the crown; .
I - Never mind the little set backs
t Nor the blows that knock you down.
Z You'll be there when they're forgotten,
If you just forget your troubles
And keep cheering someone on.
There's a lot of sorrow around you,
Lots of lonesomeness and tears; i
Lots of heartaches and of worry
1 Through the shadow of the years.
And the world needs more than triumphs;
More than all the swords we've drawn,
It is hungering for the fellow
Who keeps cheering others on. .
Let the wind around you whistle,
And the storms around you play;
You'll be there with brawn and gristle
When the conquerors decay.
You'll be here in memories sweetened
In the souls you've saved from pawn
If you put aside the victories
And keep cheering someone on.
