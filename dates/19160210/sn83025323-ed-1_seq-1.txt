PROMINENT MALTA BUSINESS
MAN PASSES AWAY MONDAY
The citizens of Malta and people
generally of all Northern Montana
were shocked by the news of the
sudden death of William McLellan,
which occurred at his home on the
evening of Monday, Feb. 7th.
Mr. McLellah was looking over
old photos of early days, remenise
ing with Mrs. McLellan, and was
about to pass from the living room
through the kitchen when he fell
and expired almost instantly.
Mr. McLellan had shown no indi
cation of ill health and his death
was a most unexpected blow to his
devoted wife and to the great host
of friends who claimed the privilege
of "Mack's" friendship. The funeral
service will be held from the house
on Saturday afternoon, Feb. 12th,
Lincoln's birthday, at 2 o'clock, the
Rev. L. J. Christler officiating. Mal
ta Lodge, No. 57 of Free and Ac
cepted Masons, of which the de
ceased was an active and honored
member, will conduct the beautiful
and impressive rites of the order
in the home, at the close of Mr.
Christler's service.
The deceased was a member of
Malta Lodge No. 57, A. F. and A.
M. of R. A. M. Chapter No. 17, Glas
gow, Montana, of Glasgow Comman
dery K. T. No. 13, of Algeria Temple
order of the Mystic Shrine, Helena,
Montana, and of Sacajeua Chapter,
order of the Eastern Star, Malta,
Montana.
Mr. McLellan is survived by his
widow, a brother John McLellan,
a sister Jean McLellan Smith, both
of Edinburgh, Scotland, and an
uncle, the Rev. James Potter of To
ronto, Canada. Mrs. Eva Noles,
mother of Mrs. McLellan, is enroute
from Albert Lee, Minn., and Mrs.
Eva. Noyes and Miss Bernice
Noyes of Clyde Park, Mont., will be
here for the funeral.
William McLellan was born in
Edinburgh, Scotland, on the 5th of
June 1870, and had only celebrated
his 45th birthday last June. At the
age of 9 years he moved from Edin
burgh to Halifax, and from thence
he subsequently came to the states
residing at Boston, ,and from
Boston he moved to Montana, and it
was here in the state he afterwards
grew to love with a loyal patriotism
that "Mack," as his legion of friends
always genially addressed him, that
he celebrated his 20th birthday.
It will be seen that for more
than 20 years William McLellan
has been associated with the life and
grolwth of Malta and Northern Mon
tana. He was one of the strong and
active members of the firm of Ed
wards & McLellan, one of Northern
Montana's largest mercantile houses
To present the portraiture of Mr.
McLellan as he now reveals himself
to the memory of our citizens and.
stands embodied before us in our
ceptions, would be an impossible
task, though it is one we all would
love to perform. The fact is ap
preciated that the quiet, modest and
unostentatious life and service of
the deceased, bespeaks and reflects
that inimitable delineation of per
sonality which is so often rare, but
which we all admire-simplicity-
that simplicity which does gracious
justice to memory. The classifica
tion of men is a very difficult task,
and yet it is one we all, almost un
consciously perform. It is not sim
ply the result of our judgment after
a careful analysis of character; it
largely belongs to our intuitions.
What a man is, is the final impres
sion he makes on the hearts and
lives about him, rather than what
he seems to be; his seeming may be
adroitly managed, but the instinc
tive and necessary influence of his
real self will sooner or later tear
off the mask.
Genuine manhood is as certain of
recognition as hypocracy is of de
tection and scorn.
It is in making search for the
foundations of this kind of charac
ter that we mark the essences which
shaped and sustained the life of
him to whose memory we offer our
tributes of affection today, as he
lay among us in the mystic sleep of
death; and in our summary of the
sketch, however imperfectly execut
ed, we reflect the thought that a
strong man has fallen in our midst.
Reliable and thorough in every du
ty; a true blue, wise and prudent;
unselfish in spirit and liberal in
mind; generous, but silently and of
ten in secret toward all good causes,
and especially to those in want;
modest and cheerful in bearing; a
human radium in daily intercourse
with his fellow men; he commanded
the esteem of all, and those who had
the happiness to be more intimately
associated with him loved him.
When with all these we think of
William McLellan as the high mind
ed public citizen who has for so
many years devoted his portion of
time and service to the promotion
of every design by which we and our
city profit today, we feel his early
death to be an irreparable loss.
As a member of the city council
of our city his influence so widely
acknowledged, was most benefi
cially felt. At the very moment
when his life was so really needed,
it ceased, and now we can only
stand at the side of his bier and in
the light of the Great Father's eter
nal verities feel in our hearts what
human speech fails to tell.

FIRE MARSHALS GET NOTICES.
The following communication has
been sent out to all Montana fire
marshals by State Auditor William
Keating, relating to the unusual
number of fires in January, and the
unlikelihood of securing any lower
insurance rates if the record con
tinues:
"In communities where vara
tions in temperature are sudden and
extreme, it is highly important that
heatin'g plants be installed in saf
est possible manner, and even if the
bad experience had thus far in 1916
does not result in the increase in fire
insurance rates, there is no question
but that a continuation of this rec
ord will effectively operate against
any general reduction of rates in
tn this state.
This office has no proper means of
publicity whereby the attention of
the public may be called to these
conditions, to say nothing of the
many ietmporary heating devices
that are nut in hurriedly on account
of a sudclen drop in temeprature. as

"I sincerely hope that through
your office, the attention of the pub
lic may be called to the urgent need
of having all permanent and tempo
rary heating plants, device, chim
neys and flues installed in a saf6
manner. This office will be glad to
