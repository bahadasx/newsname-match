EL PASO, Feb. 10. — The
greatest manhunt in .Mexican his

Chihuahua mountains.
The man who is hunted Is

The world knows him as Fran

When Villa's bandits killed IS
Americans at Santa Ysabel, (ien.
Jacinto Trevino, Carrana com
mander at Chihuahua city, called
GOO of his manhunlers and said:
"Go get Villa. Don't come
buck without mm. dead or
alive."
Nobody, least of all Trevino,
expects Villa to be brought back
alive.
Wonderful Htane.
Nature has set a wonderful
stage for this manhunt. There
are no man-made roads. Great
shaggy mountain lions pad
through the soft pine needles of
the mountain sides.
Hundreds of little brown men
with mausers strapped across
their backs, tramp day and night
In search of Villa.
There Is order in the apparent
disorder of this manhunt in the
Sierra Madras.
In a Giant Trap.
For weeks these same little
men have covered the moun
tain inch by inch in a great drive,
and now they have forced Villa
and his 300 tarnished Doradoes
— Golden Guards — back and
back until they are in a giant
trap, formed by the four walls
of a mountain range and cut off
by a raging mountain river.
First come the Taramara In

for a soiled breach cloth.

CLEVER
ATKINS
A sly boy, this Commission
er Atkins.
With his weather eye on the
mayor's chair, he brings in a
resolution to kill civil service.
It meets a chilly reception,
except from a few spoils lovers
and ward heelers out of jobs.
Whereupon he produces a
second resolution which, he
says, is to "strengthen" civil
service.
It is far more drastic than
the one the people voted down
two years ago. It goes further
than the civil service board
wants to go. He figures it is so
extreme that it will frighten
people, and, if the two are put
on a ballot together, they will
vote it down and in their excite
ment vote FOR the other.
A fine back-hand swat!
A sly boy, this Atkins!
they undertake to make a stand
In some mountain fastness, once
they are cornered for the kill.
Squat, lean, little men they
are. But theirs is the leanness
of the mountain wolf. They can
outmarch any army in the world
with their shuffling stiff-kneed
trot.
Gen. Carlos Cabecos, master of
the hunt, was picked because,
like his quarry, he knows every
mountain lair.
Outposts Watching.
Up on the crest of a sugar loaf,
two eyes watch the approach of
the hunters. The eyes are those
of a Villa outpost. It will be
many a day before Fancho is
caught napping.
Back in the mountains Villa
has surrounded himself with
picked followers.
For the most part his follow
ers are like Villa, men with a
price on their heads.
They all hate Americana.

Hon.
When they want food or horses
or money, the bandits dash down
into a valley, rob a ranch, per
haps killing a few persons in the
rnld, and dash back again.
All the veneer of diplomacy
and civilization which Villa wore
when he was the general and
aspirant for honors in Mexico's
government has been dropped.
He's a wild, bad man, this
quarry in the greatest of man
hunts.
