that Torrance county does not
feel able to continue the services
of Mr. Harwell as County Agri
cultural Agent.
In my opinion there is no em
ployee of your county that is of
more direct Denenc man your
county agent. We find that the
County Agricultural Agents in
he New Mexico counties, also in
the counties in Oklahoma where
we are acquainted, lire doing an
xcellent work in building up tne
gricultural interests of their
sections. In Beveral or tnese
counties whore ar.imal diseasfs
such as blackleg among calves or
hog cholera lias brollen out tnese
county agents have in most cases
i. me work alonK eradication lines
that has been worth hundreds ot
times their salaries to the coun
ties. In getting in tew seed or
better seed and in encouraging
better cultural methods these
agents are also returning to the
counties several times tho salar
ies they Bre being paid, in your
county especially there is a great'
need for more ot wnat we may can
diversified farming. Your mixed
farming population does not yet
know the value of the dairy cow
in building up a section. iney
know comparatively little about
the silo that will make the feed
nroduced under your limited
aintall conditions go iwice as
far. .
The Santa f e Kailway asa tax
payer in your county is paying
fully forty-five percent of your
total tax collected. We are p-iy
ing almost half of the taxes that
are collected in the state. vAs a
tax payer within the county, the
Santa Fe Railway is very "much
in favor of continuing tne ser
vices of this county agent. We
know of no other way of build
inir ud the county egriculturally
for so little outlay as that which
is received through the services
of a good competent agricultur
alist such as you now have in
Mr- Harwell.
I understand that the County
Commissioners will meet at Es
tancia on Friday, February 18th.
If either myself or one of my as
sistants can be of service in en
couraging the continuance of the
county agent's services we will
try to be represented.
Yours very truly,
II. M. Bainer.

KEMP BROS.
Opposition to the continuation
of the services of the County
Agent have advanced the argu
ment that the work materially
increases the taxes ot tne poor
man in the county. That this
statement is incorrect is proved
beyond a doubt by the following
ficrures:
On the basis of $10.00 taxes
paid into the county 16 cents of
this amount .goes towards the
support of County Agent work.
The average English speaking
taxpayer pays $5 60 taxes, which
means that 9 cents of this
amount goes to County Agent
work
The iiveruge Spanish speaking
taxpayer pays $2.50 taxes, which
means that 4 cents of this
amount goes to County Agent
work.
The burden of the responsi
bility rests on the railroads of
this county, which pay about 60
percent of the taxes, and the
strance thine is. if there is any
thing strange at all, mat tne
railroads are among the most en
thusiastic endorsers of this work.
