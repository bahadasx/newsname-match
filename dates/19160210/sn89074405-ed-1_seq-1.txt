'TREATMENT OF
WOUNDS BETTER
Berlin, Feb. 10.—According: to fig
ures just published by the German
medical weekly (Deutsche Medizln
ische Woechenschrift) the medical
corps of the German army has estab
lished better and better results almost
every month in treating the wound
ed. The record at the start was, in
fact, a very high one, 84.8 per cent
of the wounded being so completely
healed that they could return to the
ranks, 3 per cent dying, and the re
maining 12.2 per cent being dis
charged as unfit for further service
or sent away on furlough for later ex
amination.
The figures improved from then
on till the number of men returning
to duty in May, June and July reached
above 91 per cent. The most striking
improvement was the reducton in the
ratio of deaths these amounted in
June and July to only 1.2 per cent of
the wounded, as compared with 3 per
cent for August, 1914. Similarly the
ratio of wounded men sent home unfit
for duty or furloughed for further
observation was reduced from 12.2
to 7. For the first year of the war
the total record was as follows: 89.5
healed and returned to the ranks, 88
discharged as unfit for duty or for
further observation, and only 1.7 per
cent died.

DEOMl
IS CHALLENGED
Statement Made that Bran
deis has Concealed Atti
tude He Would Take.
Washington, Feb. 10.—James W.
Carmalt, chief examiner of the inter
state commerce commission, before
the senate sub-committee investigat
ing the nomination of Louis D. Bran
deis to the supreme court bench, chal
lenged the declaration of Clifford
Thorne, chairman of the Iowa rail
road commission, that Brandeis had
concealed from him the attitude Bran
deis would take in arguing the eastern
freight rate case before the commis
sion.
Yesterday Thorne, who was asso
ciated with BrandeiB in the trial of
the rate case for shippers and the
commission, declared he was dum
founded when Brandeis, at the out
set of his closing argument, conceded
the contention of the railroads that
the existing rate of returns was in
adequate for the prosperity of the
roads and best Interests of the public.
Incident Related.
"There is one incident firmly fixed
in my mind," said Carmalt," regard
ing a conversation, which Mr. Thorne
had with me on the second day of the
argument in the rate case. Mr.
Thorne, I understand, stated that
when the commission fixed the allot
ment of time for attorneys to argue
the case, he had asked the privilege
of being permitted to follow counsel
for -the shippers instead of. opening
the argument. Mr. Thorne asked me
what Mr. Brandeis' position would be.
There certainly was no disposition to
conceal it from Mr. Thorne. I am
confident that I told Mr. Thorne that
Mr. Brandeis would take the position
that the net operating income of the
carriers was not adequate, with spe
cial stress on the central freight as
sociation territory. Further, I said
that Mr. Brandeis would take the posi
tion that the methods pursued by the
carriers to obtain greater revenues
through a horizontal five per cent
increase was not the proper method of
increasing their revenues.- I am quite
cle&r" that it was as a result -of "this
conversation that 1'Mr-. .Thorne wrote
Mr. Brandeis a note asking, about a
change ig the allotment .of .time. It
Is very strongly my lmprMsion that
because Mr. Thorne recognized the
attitude Mr. Brandeis would take that
Mr. Brandeis got the conception that
Mr. Thorne wanted an opportunity to
answer Brandeis in addition to Mr.
Thome's main argument in the case."

WHITE OF EGG NOT

Gives Opinion in Famous Baking
Powder Controversy—Simply
a Trade Advantage.
(Herald Special Service.)
Bismarck, N. D., Feb. 10.—The at
torney general's opinion, given today
with reference to the use of the white

termine the strength, is that the same
does not in any way tend to deceive
the consumer to believe that albu
menized baking powder is better than
it really is.
The test merely gives to such bak

over those that do not contain the
same, which is not within the terms
of the state statute.
