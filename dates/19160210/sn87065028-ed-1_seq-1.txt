BUSINESS MATTER
Shooting Occurred on Planta
tion of Mr. Lollar About 3
O'clock Yesterday.
Mr. ('. M. Lollar, a well known
planter of the Caledonia neighbor
hood, wait shot and dangerously
wounded yesterday afternoon by Mr.
John Odum, a tenant on his planta
tion, who fired two charges of No.
8 shot into his abdomen, inflicting
wounds which are so serious in their
nature that attending physicians
lVtr that they may prove fatal.
The shooting is said lo have re
sulted from a dispute over business
matters, but citizens familiar with
the relations of the two men were
reticent when questioned regarding
the affair, and it was impossible to
obtain the details.
Immediately following the shoot
ing Mr. Lollar was brought to the
Columbus Hospital, and was later
operated on by Dr. R. C. Molloy, of
this city, and Dr. J. C. Pickett, of
Caledonia. At a late hour last night
his condition was considered grave,
and his chances for recovery are said
to be very slight
It is understood that after the
shooting Mr. Odum 'gave himself up
to officials at Caledonia.
The wounded man is a brother of
Mr. A. L. Lollar, of this city, and is

E OF IMPORTANCE
OCCURS IN THE 111 ZONE
EAST GALAC1A IS AGAIN SCENE
OF ACTIVITY ON PART OF
RUSSIANS.
London, February 8. Artillery
actions between the French and
British and the Germans continue at
various points along the Franco-Bel
gian front, but there has been no im
portant changes in position any
where. Nor have the Germans yet be
gan the great offensive for which
they are reported to be preparing.
Heavy fighting has broken out
again in East Galacia. All along the
front the artillery has been very ac
tive. The Russians succeeded, north
of Tornopol after repeated attacks,
in penetrating the Austro-Hungarian
advanced infantry posts, but were
ejected from them later on, accord
ing to Vienna.
In the Austro-Italian theartre
there have been only artillery duels,
In the Balkans quiet prevails.
Austrain battleships in the Adriat
if have ineffectually attempted to
torpedo a British cruiser and
French torpedo boat, which were aid
ing the Servian army in its evacua
tion of the Adriatic coast. A Teuton
submarine also tried to sink two en
tente allied vessels off Durazzo, but
the torpedoes missed their mark.
On advice of his physicians, King
George, who is convalescing from the
injuries sustained by him in France,
will not reopen parliament in person
next week. The session will be open
ed by a royal commission.
Mr. and Mrs. Edwin R. Sanders

The company will operate the ice

is an expert ice cream maker and

Only Three Bill Patted.
Jackson, Miss., Feb. 9. Only 3
bills introduced at the pesent Res.
sion of the legislature.iricluding one
to pay the salaries of the lawmakers
have become law by being signed by
the governor, compared to thirty
seven measures in the same period
of time passed by both houses of th
legislature and receiving the signa
ture of Earl Brewer, in 1914.
Uuless business picks up 'consider

lawmakers this legislature will go
down on record as being the slowest

tics to date show that very little pro

ew laws.
However, there is one thing the fig
ures do show, which should be taken
nto consideration, committees have
killed the majority of measures of
fered by well meaning legislators.
showing that the real work has been
n committee rooms.
Records show that a total of 412
bills have so for been introduced in
the lower house of the legislature,
nd a very large percentage of them
have been reported unfavorably by
the committees, in fact more unfa
vorable reports have come down
than in former years. Investigation
hows that the lower house is not so
behind as one might suppose as there
ire now only 45 bills with favorable
eports pending on the house calen
dar .
The senate calendar now contains
about 40 bills with favorable com
mittee reports, out of a total of 33G
introduced in the upper body ud to
date.
The Ray bill seking to nullify the
lause in insurance policies provid
ing for the arbitration of partial loss
in case of disagreements, was
defeated in the lower house at
short atternoon session Monday.
The bill, if passed, would have made
applicable the valued policy clause
to partial losses. Mr. Ray and Mr
Anderson of Forest, spoke in favor
of the bill, which was opposed on the
floor by Mr. Stone. The bill failed by
a vote of 39 to 36. The bill was the
only business transacted by the
house at the afternoon session.
A bill sent over by the house pro
viding for the purging of pension in
the state, and to eliminate there

for aiding, assisting and enrolling
unworthy persons, and for other pur

MR. LOCKK WMTKS
TOdKN. URlXiORY
Letter AUo Written by Cham
ber of Commerce Secretary
Direct to White House.
President Wilson hns been official
ly invited to visit this rity, two let
ters requesting that Columbus be In
cluded in the itenerary of hfs forth
coming southern trip having been
sent to Washington Tuesday. One of
these letters was written by Mr. W.
H. Carter, Secretary of the Chamber
of Commerce, and went direct to the
White House, while the other was
written by Hon. T. J. Locke, Jr., a
local wholesale grocer, and was
mailed to attorney general T. W.
Gregory.
Attorney-General Gregory is a na
tive of this county, and is closely re
lated by ties of affinity and friend
ship to Mr. Locke, who in his litter
urged the distinguished j twist to do
everything possible to ' induce the
President to come to Columbus if he
visits the South for the purpose of
urging upon its people the dire ne
cessity for preparedness against war.
Although few small towns will be
included in the Itinerary of the Pres
ident's forthcoming trip, Colum
bians have some reason to believe
that the invitation extended him to
come here will be excepted. When
former president Taft toured the
country in 1909, he was induced to
come here through the efforts of
Hon. J. M. Dickinson, a native of
Columbus who was then Secretary
of War, and as President Wilson has
u native son in "liscsbinet it is not
unlikely that he will follow the ex
ample of his distinguished predeces
sor in otlice and give Columbians the
privilege of extending him the hospi
tality of the city.
Mr. Carter's letter to the Presl
dent follows: !
February 8, 1916.
Hon. Woodrow Wilson, President.
Washington, D. C.
Dear Sir:
"The Chamber of Commerce of
Columbus and Lowndes county asks
that you include Columbus, Miss., in
your Sothern itineraj-y as one of the
speaking places. i
"In support of our invitation, we
desire to say you have addressed the
people of thelarge cities and through
them the American people. You
have effectually presented your mes
sage to that class of our citizens.
But there is another class of citizens
much larger and certainly as influ
ential, that should by all means hear
tbis message as you can only present
it. The people of the smaller towns
and of the country districts are as
much interested in having our conn
try prepared for any extingency as
are the people who have heard your
message and they do not all read th
daily papers.
"When President Taft spoke in Co
lumbus on his southern tour, he was
greeted by ten thousand people,
who came from surrounding towns
and villages, from the hills and val
leys of this state and of Alabama.
He spoke to one of the largest aud
ences here of, the entire trip and one
made up of a different class of peo
pie.
"If you will honor us by includ
ng our city in your tour, we promise
you a still larger audience of such a
character that through them you
may effectively reach the Great class
that compose the body of the South
ern people, the Country-loving Sou
thern farmer.
"And we need to hear you on this
question, come and tell us about it
"I have the honor to be,
"Yours faithfully,

KE-EIECTION
(h:n, sykmssi.ati-1)
FOR PROMOTION
ikely to Succeed Gn. Harri
son at Commander of Army
of Tennessee Department.
It is officially announced thut
Gen. liermett II. Young, i uininiuidt'r-
n-chief of the United Confederate
et trans, will not be a candidate for
re election at the coining leunion in
Birmingham, and thU doubtless
means that Gen. K. T. Ski s, of this
it y. will be promoted, and Gen. Geo.
Harrison, commander of the
Army of Tennessee department is
slated to nucceed Gen. Young, and
may in turn be succeeded by Gen.
Sykes, who is now adjutant general
f the department.
Gen. Sykes is one of the state's
est known citizens, being prominent
both as a veteran and as a lawyer.
He evinces the keenest interest in all
matters pertaining to the civil war,
nd Ids knowledge concerning Con
federate hidtory is most profound.
The reunion is to bo held in Bir
mingham May 16, 17 and 18, and it
is then that the annual election of
fficers will take place. The reasons
for Gen. Young's contemplated re
tirement are detailed in the follow
ing fipecial, which was r -cently sent
out from his home in It uisville:
"Bennet H. Young, 1 ommander-
n-chief of the United Confederate
'eterans, will not allow Ids name to
go before the veterans tl.is year for
re-election. In a statenutt made to-
ight Gen. Young declaif I that four
times he had been h;tiV-d hy his
comrades and that" if WSbietl to see
the honor rest upon the ahoulders of
another.
General George P. . Harrison,
commander of the Department of
Tennessee, is being put forward by
many. Gen, Harrison, though only
24 years of age when peace came
held the commission of a brigadier
general at the close of the war. Since
he laid aside his sword he has served
his country in various capacities. At
one time he served a year as presi
dent of the Alabama State Agricul
tural College."
"Gen. Young has been in ill health
for some time. In fact he was unable
to uttend the last reunion. Gen.
Young's advancement in the organi
zation of veterans has been remarka
ble., Few veterans have received the
honors that were thrust upon him."
Mr. Lee Stillman Dii.
The remains of Mrs. Emily King
Stillman, who died at her home in
Atlanta Sunday afternoon, were
brought to Columbus at noon Tues
day, and funeral services were held
at Friendship cemettry immediately
upon the arrival of the Southern
train, conducted by Rev R. B. Eg
gleston, paator of the First Presby.
terian church.
Mrs. Stillman, who was 73 years
of age, was the widow of the late
Mr. Lee Stillman, who in years gone
by was assistant postmaster in this
city. She graduated here at the old
Columbus Institute, and for the past
twenty years she has made her home
in Atlanta. She was a noble Christ
ian woman, having been a member
of the Presbyterian church. She is
survived by one daughter, Miss
Leona Stillman, and three sons,
Messrs. King Stillman, Leo Stillman
and Dr. Lowe Stillman, of Atlanta,
one sister, Mrs. Emily King, of Ok
tibbeha county, one neice, Mrs.
Nannie Cunningham, o Meridian,
and a nephew, Mr. J. H. Stillman, of
Starkville, all of whom have the
heartfelt sympathy of many friends.

went six ecks or more ago as a mem
ber of the Ford Peace Party. He
has been greeted heartily by his
many friends.
Mr. Henry was the guest of the
Rotary Club this afternoon and it is
understood he will be given an oppor
tunity to tell the Legislature about
his long journey to Copenhagen and

Supervisors Trantart Business
Of Importame at Hrfrular
Monthly Meeting.
For several years uit Alteoia hns
ben )! row ing ut u very rapid rate,
sml if the hoard of supervisors tie
t 'le to accept a bid from th Altera'
State Hank to handle the public
funds, that (own may soon become
the official financial rente of the
county. Some time ago the board,
in compliance with the law t of the
state, advertised for bids .01 hand
ling the county fundrf, and the only
response came from the Attesia
concern, which otfeied to pay in
terest at the rate of 2 per cent, on
i.aily bulanccs. The bid wa leadv
for the county solons when they lie-
fan their meeting Monday, and on
Tuesday Dr. N. D. Guerry and Mr.
J. N. Roberts, president nn.l vice-
president, respectively, of the bank,
were here for a personal confer
ence with members of the board. In
the event that the bid is accepted
the bank will be required to give
bond in the sum of $170,000 for the
faithful handling of the money, and
conference resulted in nostoonement
of final action in the matter until
the March meeting of the board. In
reaching this decision the county
solons were influenced not only by
the inclination to give the Artesia
financiers ample time to consider
the question of making bond but
by 'the probability that within the
next month the Legislature may
make i omc ilmot.es in the law i
fecting county depositories.
An important step taken by the
board was the adoption of a resolu
tion requesting the Legislature to
enact a luw providing for the abol
ition of the November court term.
This term is primarily for the trans
action of civil business, and as all
litigation of this character can be
disposed of at the session held in
April and September the holding of
this term entails upon the county
an additional expense which many
people consider entirely unnecessary.
Hon. L. H. Hatchett, president of
the board, is among those who deem
the November court term an unnec
essary expense to the county, and it
whs at his suggestion that the resolu
tion requesting the Legislature to
take the necessary steps to provide
for its abrogation was adopted.
The officials in attendance upon
the meeting were Hon. L. H. Hatch
ett, president, Messrs. (!. R. Harris,
H. H. Walters, J. A. Watson and J.
M. Ledbetter, associate members of
the board, Hon. J. H. Williams, sher
iff, and MaJ. I!. A. Lincoln, clerk, and
in addition to the matters noted
above the following business was
transacted :
Ordered that G. M. Flynn be noti
fied that he will move engine, boiler
and other machinery M-ross the coun
ty bridge at his own risk and th.it
the county will not assume any re-
iponsibility of any accident incident
hereto of any kind.
'1 he estate of W. D. Prowell, de-
c eased, and former sheriff of the
county, agree to comply with th re
con' auditor's statement and refund
to the county $190.
Ordered that W. P. Prowell be re

FORM.
Sergeant Pilot Guynemer, 21
years old, of the French flying corp,
has just brought down his fifth
iierman adversary ana has oeen
mentioned for his exploit in an of
ficial communication. Previously he
had been decorated with the cros.
of the legion of honor, the war cross
and the military medal.
The United States in a few years
will have an army of 1,000,000 men
ready to take the field and at least
10,000 surgeons will be required for
them, asserted Dr. W. C. Gorgas,
iurgeon general of the army, before
the annual congress on medicinal
education in Chicago Monday.
The House of Congress has passed
a resolution authorizing the war de
partment to lend one thousand tents
and ' cots for the United Confeder-
atee Veterans' encampment at Bir
