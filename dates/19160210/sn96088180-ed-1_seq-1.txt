GERMAN FLEET
London, Feb. 10. The Idea that
tho German fleet will come dashing
out of the Kiel canal some day, equip
ped with a new type of . 17-Inch guns
that will iilow England's dread
naughts to pieces Is ridiculed by Brit
ish naval expert. Press reports say
tho new gun will hurl more than a
ton of metal 20 mllos, and that In
activity of tho German navy recently
has been duo to time taken to place
their new weapons.
British naval officers, however, be
lieve that the 15-lnch gun with which
the monster Queen Elizabeth is equip
ped constitutes tho maximum calibre
for real efficiency, especially In the
North aca, where the British and Ger
man fleets might clash. They point
out that the Rrltlnh swift cruisers and
deatroyera could drive In small boats
which tho Germans would have to
assign to "spot" tho hits at twenty
miles, and then the 17-Inch dread
naughts would be within range of the
smaller but more accurate British
guns.
"Wo could then simply blow them
out of the water," said one naval
critic.
The hazy atmosphere of the North
sea, too, would make It difficult to
establish a range.
LOCALS LOSE TO
MURPHY AGAIN
'fir-
The high school teams again suffer
ed defeat at the hands of the Murphy

nutuber of rooters accompanied the
Grants Pass teams.
The girls opened the game and the
Murphy girls, by better teamwork,
established a largo lead. At no time
were they In danger, although In the
second half the two teams held about
even. Neither team made many bril
liant plays, the game as a whole be
ing rather slow.
In the boys' game Murphy started
with a rush and played the local boys
off their foot. By fast playing they
managed to make the score 19 to 6
In their favor by, the end of the first
half. The next half was much faster,
the high school boys bringing the
score to a point where It might prove
dangerous for Murphy. It looked at
times aa If they might be able to ob
tain tho lead, but each lime Murphy
hold and when the whistle blew the
score stood 80-28 In favor of the
Applegate team. Mr. Westcott ref
ereed for the girls and Claud Smith

PLEADS FOR
GUIS
Attorney J. N. Teal, of Port
land, Testifies at the Hear
ing Being Held to Probe
Fitness ot Wilson Appointee
Washington, Feb. 10. Friends of
Louis D. Brandeis, the "people's law
yer." named by President Wilson for
the aupremo court, are confident that
tho outcome ot senate committee
bearings to his fitness will bo fav
orable. "Tho majority of tho committee,"
said one ot Brandeia' supporters to
day, "Indicated clearly that they
thought the most Clifford Thome
proved was that he and Brandeis bad
different ideas as to how the five per
cent rate Increase should have been
conducted. There Is no reason why
the committee may not decide when
It hears Brandeia that he was right
and the Iowa commissioner wrong."
Answering Thome's charges that
Brandeis had "thrown" the rate case
to the railroads, Joseph Teal, Port
land, Oregon, attorney, and Lieuten
ant Governor Eshelman of California
camo strongly to Brandeis defense
last night.
Teal said, frankly he disagreed with
thtT'tUiirfof brandeia arguments lu
the case, but said emphatically he
did not believe Brandeis would betray
any one much less the people, as
Thorno had suggested. Teal held that
tbo Bostonlan submitted facts fairly,
and that had he done otherwise than
he did he would have been negligent
In hla duty. He expressed surprise
at the attitude taken by Thome.
Eshelman epoke similarly. The
present charges against Brandeis, he
said, were the first reflection ho had
heard against the Bostonlan's profes
sional conduct Indeed, be declared,
Brandeis tad acted In tho best of
faith and in accordance with the In
structions given htm by the inter
state commerce commission when ho
was engaged.
PLAN TO RETAIN
DUTY ON SUGAR
Washington, Feb. 10. House ways
and means committee democrats to
day tackled the problom of providing
revenues wherewith to defray tho cost
of tho administration preparedness
program.
They drafted a resolution retaining
the sugar duties, but did not decide
about lumping a number of import
ant measures In a single "omnibus"
bill, nor about considering revenue
questions separately. They do not
plan to have a party caucus about tho
sugar duties, and their resolution
probably will bo sent into the house
within ten days. ,
Meanwhile tho military and naval
oommltteos are hastening as much as
possible the conclusion of their work.
The military bills will probably be in
shape soon, but the naval measures
will be delayed tor some time,

New York, Feb. lu. Replying to
claims that he had been fostering an
organisation for the nomination of
Justice Hughes for the republican
nomination for president, former
Postmaster General Hitchcock de
clared today:

mote such an organization."

fictitious" the reported telephone con
versation with H. Brown Allen, of
Staunton, Va., in which it was sajd
he had described a move to nominate
Hughes.

cock made it plain that he approves

UHIOII PACIFIC ,
TRAIN ROBBED BY
A LI BUT
Cheyenne, Wyo., Feb. 10. Posses
are pursuing a lone, young highway
man who last night, at Green River,
boarded the eastbound Union Pacific
train No. 18, made up at Portland,
Oregon, and robbed men in the
smoker and in two Pullmans before
he (became frightened, stopped the
train and eccaped near Rock Springs.
The highwayman did not molest
women passengers, and he politely
reassured them that he intended them
no harm. Only one shot waa fired,
and that merely as a warning. It
went wide over the conductor's head.
The bandit's face was concealed by
a white mask, which only imperfect
ly hid his smooth-shaven face.
Encountering the flagman in the
smoking compartment, the bandit
forced him at the point of a revolver
to hold a hat into which he ordered
the passengers to drop only cash. In
this way he obtained $61 in the
smoker. Then he turned his atten
tion elsewhere, 'but did not stop for
the one male In the next Pullman
forward.
In the midst of operations In the
second Pullman from the observation
car the conductor entered from the
diner and drew fire from the bandit's
revolver. The conductor hurriedly
threw up his hands, but when the
robber thrust his head into a berth
to get a passenger's money the con
ductor ran back.
The highwayman then pulled the
cord, stopping the train. Thereupon
he ran hack to the observation car
and dropped oft in the darkness. Two
well-tilled coaches ahead of the diner
were thus left unmolested. The sher
iff of Green River and officials from
Rock Springs formed a posse, but got
no trace of the man.
