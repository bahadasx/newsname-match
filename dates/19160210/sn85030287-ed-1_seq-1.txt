Conference
The District Conference of the
Pratt District met in the Meade
M E. Church on Tuesday, Wed
nesday, and Thursday of last
week. There was a good pro
gram prepared and a splendid
attendance considering the kind
)f weather and the amount of
sickness throughout the town
and all over the district.
Among the important things
discussed was the financial meth
ods that would bring results and
tf worked out would put every
charge on a sound financial basis
lVv. W. T. Ward was the leader
of this department and had four
sessions on the subject during
the conference. Brother Ward
is an able man and has worked
out plans of the betterment of
this work of the churches, and
we are sure that there will be
some marked improvements in
this line in all of the charges over
the district. We have forty in
the district and most all of them
had a representative here.
The sermon on Tuesday and
on Wednesday evening by Bro
