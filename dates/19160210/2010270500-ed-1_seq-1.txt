SUE3TANCE OF GERMANY'S NOTE
ON LUSITANIA CASE IS
ACCEPTABLE.
SETTLEMENT NOW IN SIGHT
United States Has Not Increased Nor
Curtailed Demands Minor Changes
Suggested Whole Matter Up to
Berlin for Final Adjustment.
Wwlcrn Nnnpaiwi Vnlrn Nm Hrnlcft
Washington. D. C In substance the
tentative communication from Ger
many designed to settle the Lusltanln
ease is acceptablo to the United
States. High administration officials
consider that this government, in pre
vailing upon Germany to make the
concessions and agremeents an Bet
forth in the document, has achieved
recognition of all the high principles
for which it has contended In connec
tion with submarine warfare.
While the substance of the proposed
communication admittedly is satisfac
tory, minor changes to clarify the
wording and In oonncctlon with the
form which the formal document shall
take were suggested to Count von
BernRtorff, the German ambassador,
bv Secretary Lansing. The desires of
the United States in this connection
were made known to the ambassador
nfter President Wilson had discussed
the subject with his cabinet. Count
von Bernslorff immediately informed
the secretary ho knew no reason why
the changes could not be made, but
explained, in effect, that as a precau
tion he thought he was Justified in
submitting the entire matter to his
government for final approval. lie
Mil -so In a dispatch sent to Berlin.
The resulting formal communication
Is now expected.
Assurancer, were received in high
diplomatic and official circles that the
changes of wording suggested would
not In any nenpp alter the meaning.
No modifications, it wns authoritative
ly sletcd, were suggested In connec
tion with the phrase substituted for
the word "illegal" which Germany was
unwilling to uso.
Tn Teutonic diplomatic circles not
the slightest difficulty over the pro.
posed changes jb anticipated.
FACING PLOT CHARGES.
Hi
Boph and Von Schack, Teutons, In
dicted by Federal Grand Jury.
Washington, D. C. Weeks of inves
tigation by agents of the department
of justice resulted in the voting of
indictments by a federal grand jury in
San Francisco against prominent fig
tires In what are considered hero to
he two of the boldest plots Involving
questions or American neutrality that
have been uncovered since the Euro
pean war began. Among those agalnBt
whom Indictments wero voted are
Franz Boph, German consul general;
Baron E. II. von Schack, vice consul
of Germany, and Maurice Hall, the
Turkish consul general.
Consulnr officers do not enjoy the
diplomatic Immunities which ambassa
dors, ministers and attaches are jjlvcn
by International law, but are subject
to the jurisdiction of the country in
which they aro resident and may be
treated by the law as are any other
persons.
Boph and Von Schack are charged
with complicity In the plot which was
first uncovered several weeks ago
with tlie arrest of C. C. Crowley, al
leged to be a pro-German agent, who
had undertaken to cripple the Ameri
can output or munitions of war, and
in other ways to help the cause of the
Teutonic allies.
' Wilson to Enter the Race.
Washington, D. 0. President Wll
Fon'n closest advisors expect him to

of his candidacy for renominatlon

Wilson will notify the secretary of
Mate of Ohio, that the voters of the
state will havb his consent to use his
name in tho primary. Under tho Ohio
l'w a candidate Is required to notify
the secretary or state before Febru
ary 25 of his willingness to have his
name usod in tho primary. The presi
dent has been formally notified of the
law's provisions.

BERLIN BIDS CRISIS
MESSAGE TO VON BEKN3TORFF
MAKES FULL SETTLEMENT OF
LUSITANIA CASE NEAR.
NO DANGER OF BREAK SEEN
Germany Has Refused to Declare
Sinking of Liner Illegal, But Makes
Concessions Which Give Promise of
Adjustment Soon.
Washington, Fob. 7. All danger of
a rupture with Germany over tho Lu
sltanla controversy has disappeared.
Count von nernstorlT formally com
municated to Secretary or State Lan
sing on Friday the roply of his gov
ernment to the oral representations
mado to him some days ugo.
Whllo Germany has refused to do
claro that the sinking of tho l.usltanla
wus Illegal and contrary to Interna
tional law In the form desired by this
government, it can bo stated on au
thority that concessions have been
mado which give promise of adjust
ment as a result of further ex
changes. ' Whether these concessions fully
comply with tho terras of settlement
offered by President WIIbou will de
pend from the American viewpoint
on very close study and examination
of the note.
From tho German viewpoint the
communication la legarded as grant
ing substantially all that the United
States asked in the report recently
sent to his government by Count von
Bernstorrf. on the basis of his last
conversation with Secretary Lansing.
Should President Wilson not Ond tho
concessions wholl satisfactory it
seems probablo that an adjustment to
make them acceptablo can be reached
In informal conferences between Sec
retary Lansing and Count von Bern
storfr during 'the next live days.
Tho concessions made by tho Gor
man government aro of such a char
acter. It is understood, that if they
fall short of satisfying President Wil
son they have so narrowed tho margin
of difference in tho informal negotia
tions as not to necessitate tho aban
donment of the informal negotiations.
Tho danger of a break in diplomatic
relations between Germany and tho
United States, it is asserted In n very
high quarter, have been nvertod by the
new communication, and the state
ment is even made in this very rosnon
si bio quarter that there can now bo no
break between tho two countries over
tho Lusitania affair.

gible, believed to havn been tho L-l!),
which fell Into tho Noith.sea.
Thirteen men of tho crew of the
collier Franz Fischer were drowned
whon tho collier was sent to tho hot
tow In two minutes by a bomb dropped
by one ot the Zeppelins returning from
the raid made on England. Only three
mon of tho Fischer were saved.
The story of the fate or the wrecked
ntr craft Is told by tho crow of tho
steam trawler King Stephen, Captain
Martin, which arrived at Grimnny. Aid
was refused the Germans because they
outnumbered the crew of tho trawler.
It Is considered likely that tho Ger
mans have drowned by this time.
Tho fishermen say that early ou
Wednesday morning in the North sea
their nttentlon was attracted by II shes
of light apparently from a ship's sig
nal lamp. They mado for tho bpot and
found a huge mass of wreckage.
They stood by until tho light Im
proved, when It was aeon that the
wreckage wan that of tho Zeppelin
L-l 9. The cabins and a part of tho
onvelopo were under water, but a
largo pait of tho envelope was float
ing.
On the platform on tho top ot tho
envelope seven or olght Gormuns were
been. These hailed the trawler In
English, calling: "Save us. Save us.
Wo will give you plenty of money."
As the trawler carried only nine
hands and tho Gormuns numbered
about twenty-two. Captain Martin de
cided that it ..was not safe to tako so
many enemies aboard, particularly as
the trawler was unarmed. Ho feared
that his crow might he overpowered
by the Germans. The captain there
fore proceeded to report the position
of tho ulrshlp to tho proper authori
ties, adequate assistance being 3unt
afterwards, and put into Grimsby.
It is believed Hint the Zeppelin was
one of those participating lu tho raid
or January 31. Tho irshermen had
been at sea6cvoral days and wera not
iwnro of the raid.
Tl.o Zeppelin piobably was disabled
by tho Hutch coast artillery, which

SEE VALUE OF PLAYGROUNDS
No Community Is Now Considered
Complete Without Properly Lald-

It Is a fact which ought to bo of in
tenso Interest to tho peoplo of this
city that during ono week tho attend
ance of children at tho public play
grounds of Charleston reached the un
precedented flguro of 10,575. It is es
timated that about 2,509 different chiL
dren visited and mado uso of tho play
grounds during this period.
That ought to glvo tho peoplo of tho
community a clearer idea than they
havo herctoforo possessed of the im
mense value of tho playground sys
tem and of tho effectiveness of tho
system aB It is being applied in
Charleston. Probably a majority of
tho Charleston readers of this news
paper have not been aware all this
tlmo of tho lmportanco which tho few
playgrounds now available have as
sumed as a factor in tho life of tho
chlldron of Charleston. That thoso
grounds havo been made uso of In one
wcok by something liko 2,500 different
chlldron and that these children havo
resorted to tho playgrounds so con
stantly and so regularly that the total
