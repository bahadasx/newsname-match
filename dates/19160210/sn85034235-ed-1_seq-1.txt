they're there now. There's been no
travel for weeks. Now what's been
keeping them there nil the time? Let's
follow the track up the creek. There's
plenty of dead timber. We can camp
any lime."
"Sure, we can camp any time, but
we got to travel most of the time if we
ain't goin' to starve, an' we got to
travel in the right direction."
"It won't make the trip a day
longer," Smoke urged. "Fossibly no
more than a mile longer."
"Men has died for as little as a mile
Shorty retorted. "Get up, you poor
sorefoots, you—get up! Haw! You,
Bright! Haw!"
The lead dog obeyed, and the whole
team strained weakly into the soft
snow.
"Whoa!" Shorty yelled. "It's pack
trail."
Smoke pulled his snowshocs from
under the sled lashings, bound them to
his moccasined feet and went to the
fore to press and pack the light surface
for the dogs.
It was heavy work. Dogs and men
had been for days on short rations, and
few nud limited wem.- tiw- r o tm ffi-e ef
energy they could call upon. The
h rocky walls quickly drew near
together, so that their way led up near
the bottom of a narrow gorge.
"It's a trap." Shorty said. "The
hole look of it is rotten. It's a hole
the ground. It's the stampin'
round of trouble."
Smoke made no reply, and for half
n hour they toiled on in silence that
as again broken by Shorty.
"She's a-workin'," he grumbled.
She's sure a-workin'. an' I'll tell you
if you're minded to hear an' listen."
"Go on." Smoke answered.
"Weil, she tells tne, plain an' simple,
that we aiu't bever goin' to get out of
this hole in the ground in days an'
ays. We're goin' to find trouble an'
be stuck in here a long time an' then
some."
Does she say anything about grub?
We haven't grub for days and days
and days, and then some. There's the
beginning of your trouble." Smoke
said, halting on his snowshoes and
staring at an object that lay on one
side of the old trail.
Shorty left the gee pole and joined
him. and together they gazed down on
the body of a man beside the trail.
"Well fed." said Smoke.
"Look at them lips," said Shorty.
"Stiff as a poker." said Smoke, lift
g an arm that without moving moved
the whole body.
The man lay on his side, solidly
frozen. From the fact that no snow,
powdered him it was patent that he
had Iain there but a short time.
There was a general fall of snow
three days back," said Shorty.
Smoke nodded, bending over the
corpse, twisting it half up to face
them and pointing to a bullet wound
in the temple. He glanced to the side
mil tilted his head at a revolver that
lay on top of the snow.
A hundred yards farther ou they
came upou a second body that lay face
downward in the trail. "Two things
are pretty clear," Smoke said.
"They're fat. That means no famine.
They've not struck it rich, else they
wouldn't have committed suicide."
If they did," Shorty objected.
They certainly did. There are no
tracks besides their own, and each is
powder burned." Smoke dragged the
corpse to one side and with the toe
of his moccasin nosed a revolver out
of the snow into which it had been
pressed by the body. "That's what did
the work. I told you we'd find some
thing."
"From the looks of it we ain't start
ed yet Now, what'd two fat geezers
want to kill theirselves for?"
"When we find that out we'll have
found the rest of your trouble," Smoke
answered. "Come on. It's blowing
dark."
Quite dark it was when Smoke's
snowshoe tripped him over a body.
He fell across a sled on which lay nn
nther body, and when he had dug the
mow out of his neck and struck a
match he and Shorty glimpsed a third
body, wrapped in blankets, lying be
side a partially dug grave; also, ere
the match flickered out they caught
sight of half a dozen additional graves.
"B-r-r-r!" Shorty shivered. "Suicide
Camp. All fed up. I reckon they're
all dead."
"No. Peep at that." Smoke was look
at
in
on
farther along at a dim glimmer of
light "And there's another light—and
it third one there. Come on. Let's hike."
No more corpses delayed them, and
in several minutes, over a hard packed
trail, they were in camp.
"It's a city." Shorty whispered.
"There must be twenty cabins. An'
not a dog. Ain't that funny?"
And that explains it." Smoke whis
pered back excitedly. "It's the Laura
Sibley outfit Don't you remember?
Came up the Yukon last fall on the
Port Townseud No. 6. Went right by
Dawson without stopping. The steam
er must have landed them at the mouth
of the creek."
"Sure, I remember. They was Mor
mons."
"No—vegetarians." Smoke grinned
in the darkness. They won't eat meat,
and they won't work dogs."
"It's all the same. I knowed they
was somethin' funny about 'em. Had
the all wise steer to the yellow. That
Laura Sibley was goin' to take 'em
right to the spot where they'd all be
millionaires."
"Yes; she was their seeress—had vi
sions and that sort of stuff. 1 thought
they went up the Nordenskjold."
"Huh! Listen to that!"
Shorty's hand in the darkness went
out warningly to Smoke's chest, and
together they listened to a groan, deep
and long drawn, that came from one
of the cabins. Ere it could die away
it was taken up by another cabin and
another—a vast suspiration of human
misery. The effect was monstrous and
nightmarish.
"B-r-r-r!" Shorty shivered. "It's get
tin' me goin'. Let's break in an' lind
what's eatin' 'em."
Smoke knocked at a lighted cabin
and was followed in by Shorty in an
swer to the "Come in!" of the voice
they heard groaning.
"What's the matter?" Smoke de
manded of one whose blankets could
not hide his broad shoulders and mas
sively muscled body, but whose eyes
were pain racked and whose cheeks
were hollow. "Smallpox? What is it?"
In reply the man pointed at his
mouth, spreading black and swollen
lips in the effort, and Smoke recoiled
at the sight.
"Scurvy," he muttered to Shorty,
and the man confirmed the diagnosis
with a nod of the head.
"Plenty of grub?" Shorty asked.
"Yep." was the answer from a man
in another bunk. "Help yourself.
There's slathers of it. The cabin next
on the other side is empty. Cache is
right alongside. Wade into it."
In every cabin they visited that
night they found a similar situation.
—bod cmiHfeir tbW'Wtitrtrr mŒf.
Originally there had been ninety-three
men and women. But ten had died,
and two had recently disappeared.
Smoke told of finding the two and ex
pressed surprise that none had gone
that short distance down the trail to
find out for themselves. What par
ticularly struck him and Shorty was
the helplessness of these people. Their
cabins were littered and dirty. A cab
in's troubles were its own troubles,
and already they had ceased from the
exertion of burying their dead.
It's almost weird." Smoke confided
to Shorty. 'T've met shirkers and loaf
ers. but I never met so many all at one
time. Y'ou beard what they said.
They've never done a tap. I'll bet they
haven't washed their own faces. No
wonder they got scurvy."
But vegetarians hadn't ought to get
scurvy." Shorty contended. "It's the
salt meat eaters that's supposed to fall
for it And they don't eat meat, salt
or fresh, raw or cooked, or any other
way."

Smoke shook his head. "1 know.
And it's vegetable diet that cures scur
vy. No drugs will do it. Vegetables,
especially potatoes, are the only dope
But don't forget one thing. Shorty: we
are not up against a theory, but a con
dition. The fact is these grass eaters
have all got scurvy."
"Must be contagious."
"No. That the doctors do know.
Scurvy is not a germ disease. It can't
be caught It's generated. As near as
I can get it, it's due to an impoverished
condition of the blood. Its cause is not
something they've got, hut something
they haven't got A man gets scurvy
for lack of certain chemicals in his
blood, and those chemicals don't come
out of powders and bottles, hut do
come out of vegetables.'
•• An ' these people eats nothin' but
grass," Shorty groaned. "An' they've
got it up to their ears. That proves
you're all wrong. Smoke. Y'ou're spielin
a theory, but this condition sure knocks
the spots out o' your theory. Scurvy's
catchin, an' that's why they've all got
it. an' rotten bad at that You an
me'll get it too if we hang around this
diggin'."
Smoke laughed skeptically and
knocked on a cabin door.
"What do you want?" came a wo
man's sharp voice.
"We want to see you," Smoke an
swered.
"Who are you?"
"Two doctors from Dawson," Shorty
blurted in. with a levity that brought a
punch in the short ribs from Smoke's
elbow.
"Don't want to see any doctors." the
woman said in tones crisp and stac
cato. "Go away. Good night. We
don't believe in doctors."
Smoke pulled the latch, shoved the
door .open and entered, turning up the
low flamed kerosene lamp so that he
could sec. In four bunks four women
ceased from groaning and sighing to
stare at the intruders. Two were
young, thin faced creatures: the third
was an elderly and very stout woman,
and the fourth, the one whom Smoke
identified by her voice, was the thin
nest. frailest specimen of the human
race he had ever seen.
As he quickly learned, she was Laura
Sibley, the seeress and professional
clairvoyant, who had organized tile ex
peditiou in Los Angeles and lei^it to
this death camp on the Nordbeska.
The conversation that ensued was
acrimonious. Laura Sibley did not be
lieve in doctors; also, to add to her
purgatory, she had well nigh ceased
to believe in herself.
"Why didn't you send out for help?"
Smoke asked when she.paused, breath
less and exhausted from her initial
tirade. "There's a camp at Stewart
river, and eighteen days' travel would
fetch Dawson from here."
"Why didn't Amos Wentworth go?"
she demanded, with a -wrath that bor
dered on hysteria.
"Don't know the gentleman," Smoke
countered. "What's hi^been doing?"
"Nothing, except that he's the only
one that hasn't caught the scurvy.
And why hasn't he caqght the scurvy?
I'll tell you. No, l won't. And what
would have been the use? Don't I
know? I'm not a fool. Our caches
are filled with every kind of fruit
juice and preserved vegetables. We
are better situated than any other
camp iu Alaska to figh^*Bcurvy. There
is no prepared vegetable, fruit and
nut food we haven't, and iu plenty."
"She's got you there. Smoke." Shorty
exulted. "An' it's a condition, not a
theory. You say vegetables cure.
Here's the vegetables, an' where's the
cure?"
"There's uo explanation I can see,"
Smoke acknowledged. "Yet there is
no camp in Alaska like.this. I've seen
scurvy—a sprinkling of cases here and
there—hut 1 uever saw a whole camp
with it nor did I ever see such terri
ble cases, which is neither here nor
there. Shorty. We've got to do what
we can for these people, but first we've
got to make camp and take care of the
dogs. We'll see you in the morning—
er— Mrs. Sibley."
"Miss Sibley," she bridled. "And
now. young man, if you 'come fooling*
around this cabin with any doctor stuff
I'll till you full of bird shot."
Next morning, after daylight. Smoke
encountered a man carrying a heavy
sled load of firewood. £le was a little
man, clean looking and spry, who walk
ed briskly despite the lc^td. Smoke ex
perieneed an immédiat» dislike.
"What's the matter with yon?'' he
asked.
"Nothing," the little man answered.
"I know that." Smoke said "That's
why I asked you. You're Amos Went
worth. Now. why under the sun
haven't you the scurvy like all the
rest?"
"Because I've exercised," came the
quick reply. "There wasn't any need

Smoke followed him iu.

"Because 1 like to l It's easier to

The lazy blanket loafe! Do you think
that I could have st»d one around?
No wonder they got sirvy."
It was very convinng. but Smoke
could not rid himselfjf his dislike of
the man.
"What's Laura Siby got it in for
you for?" he asked aliptly.
Amos Wentworth s>t a quick look
at him. "She's a cnk." was the re
ply. "So are we allranks, for that
matter. But heaven ive me from the
crank that won't wasthe dishes that
he eats off of. and lat's what this
crowd of cranks are te "
A few minutes latelmoke was talk
ing with Laura Sible Supported by
a stick in either hamjshe had paused
in hobbling by his can.
"What have you g<it in for Went
worth für?" be asked with a sudden
ness that caught her off her guard.
Her green eyes flashed bitterly and
her sore lips writhed on the verge of
unconsidered speech. But only a splut
ter of gasping, unintelligible sounds is
sued forth, and theu. by a terrible ef
fort. she controlled herself.
"Because he's healthy." she panted;
"because he hasn't the scurvy; because
he is supremely selfish; because fie
won't lift a hand to help anybody else;
because he is letting us rot and die
without lifting it finger to fetch us a
pail of water or a load of firewood.
That's the kind of a brute be is."
Still panting and gasping, she hob
bled on ht*r way. and five minutes
afterward, coming out of the cabiu to
feed the dogs. Smoke saw her entering
Amos Wentworth's cabin.
"Something rotten here. Shorty,
something rotten," he said, shaking his
head. "W«'ve got to make them hustle

We sure got ouru cut out tor us."
Shorty grinned. "First thing we know
we'll be full of lead."
"And that's our first job." Smoke
said.
In the next hour each ot the twenty
odd cabins was raided. All ammuni
tioD and every rifle, shotgun and re
volver was confiscated.
"Come on. you invalids." was Sbor
ty's method. "Shoutin' Irons—fork 'em
over. We need 'em."
"Who says so?" was the query at
the first cabin.
"Two doctors from Dawson," was
Shorty's answer. "An' what they say
goes. Come on. Shell out ammuni
tion too."
"What do you want them for?"
"To stand off a war party of canned
beef cornin' down the canyon. And
I'm givin' you fair warnin' of a spruce
tea invasion. Come across."
CHAPTER XVIII.
"Five Hundred Dollars a Potato."
EltSDADING. bullying, and, at
times, by main strength, men
were dragged from their bunks
and forced to dress. Smoke
selected the mildest cases for the bur
ial squad. Another squad was told
off to supply the wood by which the
graves were burned down Into the fro
zen muck aud gravel. Still another
squad had to chop firewood and im
who were too weak for outdoor work
were put to cleaning and scrwbbin
the cabins and washing clothes. One
squad brought in many loads of spruce
boughs and every stove was used for
the brewing of spruce tea.
But, no matter what face Smoke and
Shorty put on it the situation was
grim and serious. At least thirty fear
fui and impossible cases could not be
taken from the beds, as the two men
with nansea and borror. learned, while
one. a woman, died in Laura Sibley
cabin. Y'et strong measures were nec
essary.
When the working gangs came In at
noon they found decently cooked din
ners awaiting them, prepared by the
weaker members of their cabins under
the tutelage and drive of Smoke and
Shorty.
"That'll do," Smoke said at !i in the
afternoon. "Knock off. Go to your
bunks. You may he feeling rotten
now, but you'll be the better for
tomorrow. Of course it hurts to get
well, but I'm going to get you well."
"Too late." Amos Wentworth sneer
ed pallidly at Smoke's efforts. "They
ought to have started in that way last
fall."
"Come along with me," Smoke an
swered. "Pick up those two pails.
You're not ailing."
From cabin to cabin the three men
went, dosing every man and woman
with a fuli pint of spruce tea. Nor
was it easy.
"You might as well learn at the start
that we mean business." Smoke stated
to the first obdurate, who lay on bis
back groaning through set teeth.
"Stand by, Shorty." Smoke caught
the patient by the nose and tapped the
solar plexus section so as to make the
mouth gasp open. "Now, Shorty! Down
she goes!"
And down she went, accompanied
with unavoidable spluttcrings and
strängt ings.
"We re covering this spruce tea route
four times a day, and there are eighty
of you to be dosed each time," Smoke
informed Laura Sibley. "So we've no
time to fool. Will you take it. or mnst
1 hold your nose?" His thumb and
forefinger hovered eloquently above
her. "It's vegetable, so you needn't
have any qualms."
"I'll—I'll take It," she quavered
"Hurry up!"
That night, exhausted as by ho hard
day of trail, Smoke and Shorty crawl
ed into their blankets.
"I'm fairly sick with It," Smoke con
fessed. "Tlie w:iy they suffer is awfnl.
But exercise is the only remedy I can
think of, and it must be given a thor
ough trial. I wish we had a sack of
raw potatoes."
"Sparkitis. he can't wash no more
dishes," Shorty said. "It hurts him so
he sweats bis pain. 1 seen him sweat
It. 1 had to put him back In the hunk
he was that helpless."
"II only we had raw potatoes,"
Smoke went on. "The vital, essential
something is missing from that prépar
ée) stuff. The life has been evaporated
out of It."
"An' If that young fellow Jones In
Wie Brownlow cabin don't croak before
inornin' 1 miss my guess."
"For heaven's sake be cheerful."
Smoke chided.
Id the morning not only was Jones
dead, but one of the stronger men who
had worked on the firewood squad was
found to have hanged himself. A
ightmare procession of days set In.
For a week, steeling himself to the
ask. Smoke enforced the exercise and
the spruce tea. and one by one and in
twos and threes he was compelled to
knock off the workers. As he was
learning, exercise was the last thing
in the world for scurvy patients. The
diminishing burial squad was kept
steadily at work, and a surplus half
dozen graves were always burned
down and waiting. One day Smoke
saw the seeress entering Amos Went
worth's cabin and followed after her.
At the door he could hear her voice,
whimpering and pleading.
Must for me," she was begging as
Smoke entered. "1 won t tell a souL"
Both glanced guiltily at the intruder,
and Smoke was certain that ho was on
the edge of something, he knew not
what, and hé cursed himself for not
having eavesdropped.
"Out with it!" he commanded harsh
ly. "What is it?"
"What is what?" Amos Wentworth
isked sullenly. And Smoke could not
name what was what.
Grimmer and grimmer grew the situ
ation. In that dark hole of a canyon the
horrible death list mounted up. Each
day, in apprehension. Smoke and Shor
ty examined each other s mouth for the
whitening of the gums and mucous
membranes—the invariable first symp
tom of the disease.
I've quit," Shorty announced one
evening. "I've been thinkin' it over,
an' I quit. 1 can make a go at slave
drivin', but cripple drivin' 's too much
for my stomach. They go from bad to
worse. They ain't twenty men I can
drive to work. I told Jackson this
afternoon he could take to his bunk,
ne was gettin' ready to suicide. 1
could see it stickln' out all over him.
Exercise ain't no good."
"Pve made up my mind to the same
thing," Smoke answered.
The everlasting miracle of Went
worth's immunity perplexed Smoke.
Why should he alone not have de
veloped scurvy? Why did Laura Sib
ley hate him and at the same time
whine and snivel aud beg from him?
On several occasions Smoke made it
a point to drop into Wentworth's cabin
at mealtime. But one thing did he
note that was suspicious and that was
Wentworth's suspicion of him. Next
he tried sounding out Laura Sibley.
"Raw potatoes would cure everybody
here," he remarked to the seeress. "1
know it. I've seen it work before."
The flare of conviction in her eyes,
followed by bitterness and hatred, told
him the scent was warm
"Why didn't you bring in a supply
of fresh potatoes on the steamer?" he
asked.
"We did. But coming up the river
we sold them all out at a bargain at
Fort Y'ukon. We had plenty of the
evaporated kinds, and we knew they'd
keep better. They wouldn't even
freeze."
Smoke groaned. "Now. mightn't
there have been a couple of odd sacks
left—accidentally, you know, mislaid
on the steamer?"
She shook her head, as he thought,
a trifle belatedly, then added. "We nev
er found any."
"But mightn't there?" he persisted.
"How do 1 know?" she rasped nngri
ly. "I didn't have charge of the com
missary."
"And Amos Wentworth did," he

jumped to the conclusion. "Very good.
Now what is your private opinion
just between us two? Do you think
Wentworth has any raw potatoes stor
ed away somewhere?"
"No; certainly not Why should he?"
Struggle as ho would with her,
Smoke could not bring her to admit
the possibility.
That night, when the camp groaned
and slept or groaned and did not sleep,
Smoke went to Wentworth's unlighted
cabin.
"Listen to me, Wentworth," be said.
"I've got a thousand dollars in dust
right here in this sack. I'm a rich
man in this country, and 1 can afford
it I think Pm getting touched. Put
a raw potato in my hand and the dust
i3 yours. Here, heft it"
And Smoke thrilled when Amos
Wentworth put out his hand in the
darkness and hefted the gold. Smoke
heard him fumble in the blankets and
then felt pressed into bis hand not
the heavy gold sack, but the unmis
takable potato, the size of a hen's
egg, warm from contact with the oth
er's body.
Smoke did not wait till morning. He
and Shorty were expecting at any time
the deaths of their worst two cases,
and to this cabin the partners went.
Grated aud mashed up in a cup, skin
and clinging specks of earth and all,
was the thousand dollar potato—a thick
fluid that they fed. several drops at a
time, into the frightful orifices that
had once been months. Shift by shift
through the long night Smoke and
Shorty relieved each other at adminis
tering the potato juice, rubbing it into
the poor swollen gums where loose
teeth rattled together and compelling
the swallowing of every drop of the
precious elixir.
By evening of the next day the
change for the better in the two pa
tienta was miraculous and almost un
believable. They were no longer the
worst cases. In forty-eight hours, with
the exhaustion of the potato, they
were temporarily out of danger, though
far from being cured.
"I'll tell you what I'll do." Smoke
said to Wentworth. "I've got holdings
in this country, and my paper is good
anywhere. I'll give you $500 a potato
up to $50,000 worth. That's 100 pota
toes."
"Was that all the dust you had?'
Wentworth queried.
"Shorty and I scraped up all we had.
But, straight, he aud 1 are worth sev
eral millions betweeu us."
"I haven't any potatoes," Wentworth
said finally. "Wish 1 had. That po
tato I gave you was the only one. I'd
been saving it all the winter for fear
I'd get this scurvy. I only sold it so
as to be able to buy a passage out of
the country when the river opens."
Despite the cessation of potato juice,
the two treated cases continued to im
prove through the third day. The un
treated cases went from bad to worse.
On the fourth morning three corpses
were buried.
Then Smoke and Shorty together in
vaded Wentworth's cabin, throwing
him out in the snow, while they turn
ed the interior upside down. Laura
Sibley hobbled in and frantically join
ed them in the search.
Though the very floor was dug up,
they discovered nothing.
Another day passed, during which
they kept a steady watch on Went

when he started out, water bucket In
hand, for the creek they casually ap
proaened the cabin, and each time he'
hurried back without the water.
"They're cached right here ln bis
cabin," Shorty said. "But where!
We sure overhauled it plenty." He
stood up and pulled on his mittens.
"I'm goin' to find 'em if I have to puli
the blame shack down a log at a time."
He glanced at Smoke, who. with an
intent, absent face, had not heard him.
"What's eatiu' you?" Shorty demand
ed wrathfully.
"Just trying to remember something,
Shorty."
"What's the game?"
"Watch me, that's all," Smoke baf
fled. "1 always told you. Shorty, that

Several minutes later, under a pale
gleaming, greenish aurora borealis, the
two men crept up to Amos Went
worth's cabin. Carefully and noise
lessly they poured kerosene over the
logs, extra drenching the door frame
and window sash. Then the match
was applied, and they watched the
finmiug oil gather headway. They
drew back beyond the growing light
and waited.
They saw Wentworth rush out, stare
wildly at the conflagration and plunge
back into the cabin. Scarcely a minute
elapsed when he emerged, this time
slowly, half doubled over, his shoul
ders burdened by a sack, heavy and
unmistakable.
Smoke and Shorty sprung ut him like
a pair of famished wolves. They hit
him right and left at the same instant
He crumpled down under the weight
of the sack, which Smoke pressed over
with his hands to make sure. Then
he felt his knees clasped by Went
worth's arms as the man turned &
ghastly face upward.
"Give me a dozen, only a dozen
half a dozen—and you can have the
rest," he squalled. "Just half a dozen,"
he wailed. "Just half a dozen. 1 was
going to turn them over to you—to
morrow. Yes, tomorrow. That was my
Idea. They're life! They're life! Jost
half a dozen!"
"Where's the other sack?" Smoke
bluffed.
"I ate it up," was the reply, unim
peachably honest. "That sack's all
that's left Give me a few. You can
have the rest."
"Ate 'em up!" Shorty screamed. "A
whole sack! An' them geezers dyln'
for want of 'em! This for you! An*
this! An' this! An this! You swine!
Y'ou hog!"
There was no sleep in camp that
night. Hour after hour Smoke and
Shorty went the rounds, doling the
life renewing potato Juice, a quarter
of a spoonful at a dose, into the poor
reined mouths of the population. And
through the following day while one
slept the other kept up the work.
There were no more deaths. The
most awful cases began to mend with
an immediacy that was startling.
"Nary a potato." Shorty told the
whining, begging Wentworth. "Yon
ain't even touched with scurvy. You
got outside n whole sack, an' you're
loaded against scurvy for twenty years.
Knowin' yon. I've come to understand
