Man Who Swindled B. G. Odd
. Fellows Now in Prison.
Perrysburg Grain & Seed Co. Take
Over the Maddy Property.
"After many days" the money
may come back, so the B. Q. Odd
Fellows hope'.
On July 20, 1911, a smooth
swindler giving the name of Henry
H. "Wagner, worked a game at B.
G. by using a fraudulent deed to
the George Slotterbach farm near
Bradner, which he used to secure
a loan of $2,000 frorm the lodge of
Odd Follows.
The deed was recorded but Mr.
Slotterbach knew nothing of it
until reading a report of transfers.
He investigated and discovered the
fraud and was compelled to go
into court to quiet his title to his
property.
Wagner was arrested some time
in 1915, and is now in the peniten
tiary at Waupun, Wis., and his
property is now in the hands of
the court for proper distribution
and settlement of claims against it,
and it is this fact that gives the
B. G. men the hope of again pos
sessing their $2,000 or a part
thereof.
There are several other localities
where he worked and all are hop
ing for returns.
Before being arrested Henry
Wagner was a director of one of
the banks at Forest City, Arkan
sas, and was one of the prominent
men of the city. He was a married
man with no children, and owned
a cotton plantation of 8G5 acres be
sides other property. He was
recognized as the man wanted for
many crimes but escaped from the
jail at Waukesha, Wisconsin, by
hitting the jailer over the head
with an iron bar. He was shortly
afterwards recaptured at St.
Louis, Mo., and is now working at
the binder's trade in the state
prison.

patriarchal rooster whose voice had
long been the customary signal of the
rising of the sun, is deeply to be re
gretted. And that this act should be
the work of one of our most promi
nent citizens is all the more deplor
able. The result is that he will be tried
in public for the larceny of the fowl
and his questionable attitude towards
roosters in general will be given an
airing in the near future.
The parties in the case are so
prominent that it is feared no court
room will hold the vast crowd de
sirous of attending the trial, so it
will be held in Perrysburg Town Hall
on Tuesday evening, February 22nd,
under the auspices of The Perrysburg
Civic Association, for whose benefit
the proceeds will be devoted.
In other words, it will be a mock
court trial, in which a large number
of our most prominent and popular
citizens will participate.
The committee having the affair in
charge have engaged Col. A. V. New
ton of Worcester, Mass., the veteran
manager of these entertainments, to
attend to the details and personally
conduct the trial.
Col. Newton has had remarkable
success in the leading cities of the
country and without doubt the mock
court trial will be here, as elsewhere,
one of the most pleasing and suc
cessful entertainments of many sea

Concerning Nothing Very Serious
But Worthy of Thought.
A postcard from H. P. Lucas,

"All kinds of weather here snow

A Chicago woman speaker said
that half our1 male incorrigablcs
are the result of "starved family"
life. This is another sample of the
silly sentimental bunk that ' ' short
haired women and long haired
men" are chattering about these
days. What they really need is' a
little ambition and determination
to work "whaled" into them and
they wouldn't have time for so
much incorrigability. Greese their
systems witli copious and frequent
doses of "strap oil" and their ma
chinery will run along without a
"squeak."
We trust the ladies will remem
ber this leap year that our citi
zenry is trained and accustomed
to arms. Sentinel.
Arms! Where? Whose? How?
Gee, but there certainly is mystery
in that paragraph.
Just suppose our country was to
get into war with Germany within
the present year "How many
munition factories would be in ex-
l istence 10 days after war was de
clared?" Did you notice how
easily the Canadian Parliament
buildings were desroyed?
"Right or Wrong, My Coun

duty of every man.

FOR CHILDREN'S COUGH.
You cannot use anything better for
your child's cough and cold than Dr.
King's New Discovery. It is prepared
from Pine Tar mixed with healing and
soothing balsams. It does not contain
anything harmful and is slightly laxa
tive, just enough to expel the poisons
from the system. Dr. King's New Dis
covery is antiseptic kills the cold
' germs
raises the phlegm loosens
tho cough and soothes the irritation
Don't put'1 off treatment. Coughs and
Colds often lead to serious lung
troubles. It is also good for adults and
the aged. Get a bottle today. All

for divorce from Eva Porter. They
have no children.
Laura Alta Wisterman asks for
divorce from George J. Wisterman
to whom she was married ten years

four children.
Because she claims he has failed
to provide for herself and two
children, Pearl Shanteau asks for

Third partial account of N. L.
Hanson, eexcutor of the will of
Mary Taylor, deceased.
Trial of William Schier, of Mau
mee, for the alleged killing of Ray
mond Pratl; at Perrysburg on Oc
tober 7th last in an automobile ac
cident, was set for today but de
fendant's attorney, L. M. Murphy,
of Maumce, appeared Thursday
and asked Judge McClelland to re
assign it. The court did this, as
signing it for February 28th.
Seiner will answer the indictment
for manslaughter at that time. It
is expected that the case will take
more than a day to try.
It don't pay to trifle with the
court, so it proved to Nicholas
Beard. He was to be tried for
malicious destruction of property,
but when the case was called
Beard was absent, and Judge Mc
Clelland sent a depuy sheriff after
him. The jury did not convict
Beard, but when he was asked by
the court why he failed to appear
for trial, and gave the very poor
excuse that his education was
deficient, the court said it was then
time his education began, "and I'll
start it by giving you seven day?
in jail for contempt of court," and
Nicholas has learned the story of
1 ' seven days. ' ' The court may not
be very amusing, but he is very
practical and a good teacher.

The need of revival meetings
during the winter months, for
churches . and communities was
never more insistent than at the
present time.
But they are worth little unless
they contribute to the renewing of
the minds of Christians and the
conversion of sinners. And both
of these things are needing to be
done. "Come thou with us and
we will do thee good; for the Lord
hath spoken good concerning
Israel."
PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.
Services for Sunday, February 13.
The services of the church last
Sunday in observance of Young
People's Day proved interesting
and instructive to the goodly con
gregations present. The evening
service was especially attractive,
and was conducted entirely by the
Christian Endeavor Society with
President Edwin A. Clay, presid
ing. The general theme was "Fidel
ity and Force," with efficiency in
church work as the outstanding
feature strongly advocated by the
speakers, who were Miss Marjorie
Wilson, Miss Grace Hollenbeck,
Miss Lela Hollenbeck, Mrs. W. H.
Roose, Carleton Finkbeiner, Donal
B. Pheley and Russel Compton.
