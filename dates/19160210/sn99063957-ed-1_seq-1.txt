ENGLISH FLEET WINS
EASILY IN PAPER WAR
Experts Show How German Fleet Would Be Annihilated If
It Made Dash From Kiel On Western Front Battle
I Rages In Swirling Snowstorm German Loss Appalling
Rumania Sends Reservists Home-Greece Will Not
; Be Drawn In Nothing Known of Capture of Roon
r By Wilbur S. Forrest,
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
London, Feb. 10. The idea that the German fleet will
come dashing out of the Kiel canal some day, equipped
with a new type of 17 inch guns that will blow England's
dreadnoughts to pieces is ridiculed by British naval ex
perts. Press reports say the new gun will hurl more than
a ton of metal 20 miles, and that inactivity of the German
navy recently has been due to time taken in placing these
new weauons.
British naval officers,
fifteen-inch gun with which
is equipped, constitutes the maximum caimre ior reai
efficiency, especially in the North Sea where the British
and German fleets might clash.
They point out that the British swift cruisers and
destroyers could drive in small boats which the Germans
would have to assign to "spot" the hits at twenty miles,
and then the 17-inch dreadnoughts would be within range
of the smaller but more accurate British guns.
"We could then simply blow, them out of the water"
said one naval critic.
The hazy atmosphere of the North sea, too, would
make it difficult to establish a range.
London. Feb. 10. German losses in
the terrible fighting for tb. Vimy

Know Nothing Of Capture.
Hamilton, Bermuda, Feb. 10. Noth
ing is known here concerning reports
of capture of the German warship Roon
bv the British armored cruiser Drake.
The above message to the United
Press refers to the report carried yes
terday bv the New York Globe, say
ing the Drake had bagged the Roon
mid two merchantmen! after a mree
hour fight about 200 miles from Ber
muda. Similar denials came today from
several other correspondents. Capture
of the Roon, cupposed by some to have
been the raider that caught the British
liner Appam, remains unconfirmed.

Cleaned Out Passengers In
Smoker and One Pullman
But Did Not Rob Women
Chevenne, Wyo., Feb. 10 Posses arc
pursuing a lone, young highwayman who
last nignt at Green itiver boarded the
eastbouud Union Pacific train ro. 1H
made ur at Portland, Ore., and tobbed
men in the smoker and in two Pullmans
before ho became frightened, stopped
the train and escaped near Kock
Springs.
The highwayman did not molest wo
men passengers, and ho politely reassur
ed them that he intended them no harm.
Only one shot was fired, and that mere
ly as a warning. It went wide over tne
conductor's head.
The bandit's face was concealed by
a white mask which only imperfectly
hid his smooth shaven face.
Encountering the flagman in the
smoking compartment, the bandit
forced him, at the point of a revolver,
to hold a hat into which he ordered
the passengers to drop only cash. In
this way he obtained $61 in the smoker.
Then he turned his attention elsewhere
but did not stop for the one male in the
next Pullman forward.
In the midst of operations in the sec
ond Pullman from the observation car,
the conductor entered from the diner,
and drew fire from the bandit's revol
ver. The conductor hurriedly threw
up hi-s hands, but when the robber
thrust his head into a berth to get a
passenger's money, the conductor ran
back.
The highwayman Then pulled the
cord, stopping the train. Thereupon
he ran back to the observation ear
and dropped off'in the darkness. Two
well filled conches ahead of the diner
were thus left unmolested. The sher
iff of Green River, and officials from
Kock Springs formed a posse but got
no trace of the man.
Austrian Submarine
Robs Standard Oil Ship
Washington, Feb. 10. Austria must
explain why a submarine stopped the
Standard Oil tanker Petrolite recently
on the high seas and helped itself to
stores aboard.
In announcing this today, Secretary
of State Lansing said the request was
not a note, though "perhaps there may
be demands later."
The demands are based on affidavits
of Captain Thompson that the Pctro
lite, flying the American flag and show
iug other neutrul markings, while en
route from Alexandria, Egypt to Phila-
delphia was fired on by a submarine,
i ami one member or the crew was
wounded bv a shot after the shin ston
submarine.
It is reported that Thompson's offi-
ilavit claimed the submarine fired on
il,;m R9 he was rowing to diver to pre
sent his papers.
Officials, however, refused to consid
er tho case as a new "crisis" in inter
national affairs, and they insisted that
if the situation is as outlined br
Thompson, Austrin will offer reparation
nnd indemnity as she promised in her
Ancona note.

Politicians Expect President
to Announce Candidacy
In Near Future
HUGHES IS SHY ABOUT IT
BUT ROOSEVELT WILLING
Latter Would Accept Nomin
ation If Coming From
Northern States
Washington. Feb. 10. Spring politi
cal millinery is being hurled into the
ring, and yanked out again with real
Juno fervor. The White House, Oyster
Bay and the supreme court are the
gossip centers as politicians are buzzing
about new developments affecting
President Wilson, Colonel Roosevelt and
Justice Hughes.
Publication of Justice Hughes' letter
to Representative Slemp declaring his
hat is not in the ring for the repub
lican nomination brought the New
Yorker into the political limeliirht to
day for possibly tho last time unless his
name is suddenly sprung in the June
convention of tho O. O. P.
At tho same time, publication ' '
President Wilson's letter, permitting
use of his name in tne Ohio primaries,
and thus definitely throwing his hat
into the ring, is imminent.
And ncnin, the declaration of Ceci'
Lynn of Texas that Roosevelt wi"
eept the presidential nomination if i
comes from republican and not south
ern stntes added to the general ex
citement attendant upon the politics!
millinery exhibit. Roosevelt's forth
coming trip to the West Indies, he snM
is intended to provide another "back-
from-Africa" home coming.
Slemp's letters indicated that Mr.
Hitchcock is interesting himself in a
cnmonieii for Hughes. From Hitchcock.
however, came a denial today that such
is the case, while Hughes' reply to
Slemp declared that the justice is out
of the politicnl game.
The administration drew some sun
shine from the announcement of the Ne
braska gubernatorial candidacy of
Charles Brvan of Lincoln, with the 1111
mntion that he and presumably his
brother, former Secretary of State Bry
an will support President Wilson's
nomination although opposing his pre
paredness program.
No Organization for Hughes.
New York. Feb. 10. Replying to
claims that he had been fosterinfg an
organization to work for the nomination
of Justice Hughes for the icpublicnn
nomination for president, former Post
master General Hitchcock declared to
day; "There is no organization as far ns
I know, working for Hughes' nominn
tion. Neither am I about to promote
anv- such organization."
Correspondence between Representa
tive Slemn. Virginia republican, nnd
Hughes, claimed Hitchcock had been
trying to pnin Virginia republican sup
port for Hughes. In reply. Hughes
wrote that he was out of politics end
was opposed to use of his name in con
nection with the nomination.
Will Attack Armed
Ships Without Warning
By Carl W. Ackennan.
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Berlin, Feb. 10. Beginning with
February 2!, Germany will regard
armed merchantmen as warships, ac
cording to a memorial, addressed to
neutral nations, received by American
Ambassador Gerard today. '
Under Secretary Zimmerman de
clared: "We believe we can meet
Secretary Lansing's idea about sub
marine warfare."
Germany is taking this step because
of Great Britain's secret instructions
to merchantmen to fire on submarines
before they have any ehnnce to attack.
The niemo'iinl recited that there have
been 19 such instances.
The time between now and the 29
is allowed so that neutral nations may
have an opportunity to adjust their
commerce to this new situation.

mcDibinntt
All His Principal Accuser
Proves Is That He and
Brandeis Disagreed
TOO MUCH OF BOTH
Washington, Feb. 10 Senate
investigators who yesterday
heard Louis D. Brandeis, su
preme court nominee, criticised
as too friendly toward capital,
today heard iiim criticised as
being too unfriendly toward it.
Thomas C. Spelbnan, of New
York, the first witness, made
this attnek, basing it on the
1910 rate case in which Bran
deis appeared for the govern
ment. Washington, Feb. 10. Preceding
Spelling, J. W. Carmalt, examiner for
the interstate commerce commission
who took part in the 1910 and 19K! rate
cases, said that Thome need not have
been surprised at Brandeis stand 111
favor of more revenue. He declared
lirandeis did not conceal his stand in
the matter when it came time for final
arguments, as it had been charged by
Thome. Moreover, Carmalt testified
that "no had notified Thome about
Brandeis' intention.
'Was Brandeis retained to help the
railroads develop .their business?
queries Senator Clark. "Didn't he
uso his talents against the public)"
"The record will show that ract to
a degree." replied the witness.
today s tour hour exciting session
adjourned this afternoon to Tuesday
after subpoening former President .Mel
len of the New York, New Haven and
Hartford railroad as a witness.
Have Nothing On Him.
Washington, Fell. 10. Friends of
Louis I). Brandies. Boston attorney,
named by President Wilson for the su
preme court bench, arc confident that
the outcome of senate committee hear
ings as to his fitness will be favor
able. .
"The majority of the committee, "
said one of Brandeis' supporters to
day, "indicated clearly that they
thought the most Clifford Thome prov
ed was that he and Brandeis had dif
ferent ideas as to how the five per
cent rate increase eases should have
been conducted. There is no rason
why the committee may not deeido
when it hears Brandeis that he was
right and the Iowa commissioner
wrong."
Answering Thome's charges that
Brandeis had "thrown" the rate case
to the railroads, Joseph Teal, Portland,
Oregon, attorney and Lieutenant (Gov
ernor Eshleman, of California, camo
strongly to Brandeis detense last
niL'ht.
Teal said frankly ne disagreed with
the basis for Brandeis arguments in
the case, but said emphatically he did
not believe Brandeis would betray any
one much less the people as Thome
had suggested. Teal held that the
Bostonian submitted facts fairly, and
that had he done otherwise than he did
iic would have been negligent in his
duty. He expressed surprise at the at
titude taken by Thome.
Eslileinan spoke similarly. The pres
ent charges against Brandeis, he said,
were the first reflection he bad heard
against the Bostonian professional
conduct. Indeed, he declared Brandeis
hail acted in the best of faiti and inidon cables as meeting with a "terrible
accordance with instructions given him accident" in mid-Atlantic. Shipping

sion when he was engaged.
Many Warrants to Issue

Washington, Feb. 10. In a hearing
today on the Alexander $50,000,01X1
government merchant marine bill, Wil
liam Douglas, representing the chamber
ot commerce of tho United States said
the people of tho country do not en
dorse the idea of governmental en
trance into the shipping business.
This statement provoked Chairman
Alexander to reply, " It is a question,
whether you speak for the people."
Then, when Douglas said the peopla
are eager for a merchant marine, and
do not care how they get it, Represen
tative Hardy queried: "Doesn't th
chamber propose to oppose this bill
because the chamber favors a subsidy;
plant"
"If the committee remains stub
born," retorted Douglas, "I thiuk the
chamber should oppose you. But if
you limit the time tho government shall
continue in the business to five years,
for example, I would probably sup
port the bill."
When Douglas presented a referen
dum showing tho chamber overwhelm
ingly opposed to the bill, and is in f i-
I vor of subsidies to foster growth of a

.he had hoard tho rank and file of tb
