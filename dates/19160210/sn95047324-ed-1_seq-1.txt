CATTLE TICKS
ARE MUCH WORSE
THAN WOUNDS
Not
a Theory, But Proven by
Experimen ts
THERE'S MONEY INVOLVED
Increased Profits and Easy Hand
, ling Makes it Worth While to
Exterminate Ticks, According
to Authorities.
If one of your steers or dairy
cows got a bad cut and was bleed
ing nearly, a quart of blood a day,
you'd do something about it in a
hurry. You'd know that such
loss of blood would weaken the
animal, prevent its putting on
weight, and, in case of the cow,
you'd soon see the milk flow fall
off, : If you couldn't handle the
wound yourself you'd think it a
good investment to pay a veteri
narian from 50 cents to $1, or
more, to stop the bleeding.'
Ticks hate the same effect on a
steer or a cow as such a wound,
but the difference is that you
don't see the blood dripping be
cause it flows into the tick. Every
tick' bite is a tiny wound, on the
animal through, which blood is
constantly being drawn. These
tiny -wounds and the drawing of
this blood irritate the animal and
weaken it just the same as the
wound. The wound, of course,
may become infected and make
the animal "very sick, but the tick
in addition to causing blood to
"flow may give the animal Texas
fever and even kill it.
This is not theory. Actual ex
periments show that where an an
imal is heavily infested with ticks
they will draw as much as 200
pounds of blood a year from a
; i,uuu-pouna steer, ui course mcy
, do not draw this all at once, but
get it in tiny sucks. Figures show
that the blood in a steer at any.
vOne time weighs about 50 pounds.
.Where the ticks are very numer
ous and very busy, therefore, they
force the animal to renew its
blood four times a year. This
means that blood that should go
. to fflflkp millr nr mnnt unco intn
v r,--.-
fattening ticks. An actual experi
ment showed that a tick-infested
steer which, weighed only 730
Bounds and was a serawnv ani
mal, when freed from ticks by be
ing dipped in the arsenical, dip
ping bath gained 385 pounds in
weight in two months.
The price that you'd pay a vet
erinarian for curing a wound, or
that you would spend for lini
ments and cloths to cure the
wound yourself, would more than
pay for dipping ticky cattle, and
save this terrible drain on their
blood and strength. The trouble
in driving the animal to the dip
ping vat and letting it swim
through would be less than treat
ing the wound.
It costs only 50 cents a head at
most, including the first cost of
thppmg vats, to clear cattle of
these bloodsuckers. It will cost
your county only $50 to $100 to
build a dipping vat, and you
can figure how much this first
cost per head is if divided among
all the cattle near the vat. After
the vat is built, 5 cents a head
will pay for arsenic for enough
dippings to rid your county of
ticks.
Moreover, when a beef animal
has been freed from ticks, be
cause it can be sold in the open
pens at the stockyards in compe
tition with other free cattle, it
brings from $5 to $10 more per
head than when offered for im
mediate slaughter only from a
quarantine pen. It costs less to
ship tick-free cattle than ticky
cattle, because ticky cattle have
to be shipped under quarantine
restrictions, which add greatly to
the cost, and make the animal
worth less at home and cause it
to bring less net profit at the
packing house.
The U. S. Department of Agri
culture will be glad to work with
you, your neighbors, your county,
and your s,tate to free your dis
trict of ticks and help you estab
lish a profitable stockraising and
dairying industry. It will sup
ply free information, and when
your district shows that it means
business and wants to take the
profits that await it the Depart
ment will be glad to send its ex
pert field men' to supervise the
building of vats, to prepare the
arsenical baths, and to help you
to dip your cattle. Full informa
tion can do no harm. Write- to
day to the Secretary of Agricul
ture, Washington, D. C, for data
as to what the tick is costing you,
and how little money and time it
will take to make your county
free area. Bulletin U. S. Dept.

EX-GOV. GILCHRIST
AT PALM BEACH
. '; V. l
Spends Several Days there While
on Campaign Trip Down
the East Coast
Albert W. Gilchrist, 'former
governor of Florida who is now
in the midst of his campaign for
senatorial honors, arrived in the
city yesterday and is registered
at the Lake Park hotel. lie spent
the greater portion of the day
yesterday calling upon his many
friend's here who extended to him
the glad hand of welcome. Mr.
Gilchrist will remain here several
days.
The ex-governor is one of the
most notable characters in the
stato and while serving as govern
or from 1909 to 1913 he made a
wonderful .'record which will
stand him in good stead in his
present campaign. He enjoyed
the distinction, during the last
two years he was in office of hold
ing the high office of Grand Mas
ter of the Masonic fraternity a
double tribute to which but few
men in the entire south can lay
claim. t
A Floridian by birth, General
Gilchrist is close, to the hearts of
the people of his native, state and
his intimate knowledge of their
wants popularized his governor
ship. He never lost sight of the
fact that, he was a servant of the
people and during the four
years he was at Tallahassee he
was continually working for the
best interests of the state at large.

Luning's Good Work
As the result of the work of
State Treasurer J. C. Luning,
three officials of the defunct Flor
ida Life Insurance Company have
been indicted by the Grand Jury
in' Jacksonville, on charges of
grand larceny and embezzlement,
and the president of the company
was also indicted for alleged per
jury. It has taken time to secure
the evidence, but since the ' last
Legislature gave the State Treas
urer the necessary authority and
provided for the employment of
competent examiners - and ac
countants, the affairs of the com
pany have been most thoroughly
investigated and the indictments
are the result of. the evidence se
cured. The policvholdcrs in this
company have not lost a dollar,
as through the able management
of the State Treasurer all have
been re-insured, and a large num
ber of claims have been paid by
the company to which the policies
were transferred.
Through State Comptroller W.
V. Knott, the president and cash
ier of the former Commercial
Bank of Jacksonville are now un
der indictment on charges alleg
ing embezzlement of the -bank's
funds and now the president
treasurer and assistant treasurer
of the Florida Life Insurance
Company have been indicted
through the untiring efforts of the
State Treasurer. '
A number of Florida "yellow
journals" have for months been
charging State officials with neg
lect of duty for not causing the
arrest and punishment of the offi
cials of these two defunct institu
tions. The work has been pro
gressing steadily, and no atten
tion has been paid to the attempts
of those responsible for the at
tacks on the State officials. The
evidence has been secured; the in
dictments have, been returned by
the grand jury, and it now re
mains to be seen how the cases
will be handled in the Criminal
Court of Record in Duval county
and what the verdict of the petit
jury trying the cases will be.

filler, at least not that, kind.

stuff ranging from poetry to poli
tics fill the capacious bean hamp

have tried. Plant City Courier.
Lettuce Drop Fungus Attacks
Peas and Beans
The University of Florida Ex
periment Station has received
specimens of beans and peas re
cently which were attacked by a
white" mold. This is the same
fungus which causes stem rot. of
cucumbers, and watermelons,
white foot rot of celery, and let
tuce drop. It rots all parts of
the peas and beans above ground.
Indications are that the disease is
beginning work also in lettuce
fields.
After a short peiord of devel
opment the tungus produces
blackish irregular bodies, which
under favorable conditions pro
duce small mushrooms. These
give rise to millions of minute
spores which are readily spread
tn neichborine fields by the
slightest breeze. The only known
method of controlling the disease
is to watch the crop carefully and
destroy any 'affected plants to
prevent fruiting bodies.
'Besides this it is necessary to
soak the ground where the dis
ease appears with a good fungi
cide, such as ammonical solution
of copper carbonate, so that the
fungus will not spread by its veg
etative branches. Thousands of
dollars are lost annually from
this disease and growers cannot
afford to let it go unhindered.

A PARADISE IN
A TRUE SENSE
So Made by Nature Has All Es
sentials SCENES OF GREAT BEAUTY
Is a Place of Great Human Ap
pealIn Winter,. East Coast,
West Coast and Central Florida
Practically One Vast Resort.
There is a beautiful ancient
word which is so overused and so
1 1 . 1 1 A. 1 1 A. - . .
uari'iessiy uscu uiai, us n ue meaiv i
ing has been obscured. This
word is paradise, and it means
park, garden, a lovely spot. King
Cyrus built a paradise, and . al
ways when the ancients used this
word they referred to any natur
al or artificial scene of great
beauty. Three things were essen
tial to the paradise: water, flow
ers and abundant scenery.
Florida has all these and more,
but even so it might fall short of
being a paradise were it not for
the park-like arrangement, the
disposition of shore and palm, of
lake and hammock, and last, but
not least the social center of the
United States. There is by nature
a symphony, one might almost
say a pattern in the way of Flori
da as a park has been created. It
is therefore a place of great hum
an appeal : and no paradise is a
paradise unless it has this quality.
The Alps, the Falls of Zambesi,
Piko's Peak, Niagara Falls, these
are wonders, in no sense para
dises. They do not say to you as
a paradise must say, "Come live
with me."
. Florida is a true park. It is a
vast park, a green, brown, sky-
arched, coral beached, alluring,
soothing, human park. And it
has not been cursed by the tamp
ering hand of man in the effort to
make it appeal to the vulgar. So
far as man has built for his rec
reation, he has built there to com
plete and round out the picture.
And one who has, not beheld the
wondrous beauty of the sunsets
on the white walls of the Alcazar
or the Ponce de Leon, at St. Au
gustine,, has missed one of the
most exquisite sights of nature.
Here one sees the architecture of
Spain at its resplendent best.
In the winter tune, Florida is
practically one vast resort. There
are hundreds of fascinating plac
es on the east coast, on the west
coast and in the beautiful interior.

Station Can Tell Yoa Who
Seeds or Stock
Has
Do you want to buy seeds, or
pure-bred livestock? Many farm
ers would like to have home
grown seed or pure-bred southern
livestock but do not know where
,to obtain them. C. K. McQuarrie,
state agent for the University of
Florida Extension Division, asks
those who are in the market for
such produce to apply to the Ex
periment Station, Gainesville. A
list of farmers who have seeds or
livestock for sale is kept.
It is frequently impossible to
find velvet beans, Natal seed,
home grown potatoes, or other
seeds on the open market, while
farmers may have them on hand.
It is desirable to obtain southern
pure-bred stock if it can be had.
The number of men who have
such stock for sale is increasing
and it is probable that those who
desire it can buy it close at hand. I

New Plans for Dipping Vats
Dr. C. F. Dawson, veterinarian
to the State Board of Health, of
fers the following, information to
farmers who are interested in dip
ping vats:
"Bureau of Animal Industry
Circular 207 gives directions for
dipping cattle to destroy ticks, in
cluding plans and specifications
tor the construction of concrete
and brick vats. Certain chances
in the concrete vat, so as to make
it more suitable for range condi
tions, have recently ' been suggest-
led and are embodied in the ac
companying plan and bill of ma
ftcrials. The principal differences
consist in the vat being larger
and .having perpendicular instead
of sloping sides. A longer or
shorter vat could, be made if de-'
sired.
"Copies of the circular may be
obtained by addressing the Secre
tary of Agriculture, Washington,
D. C."
SYSTEM OF. SAVING
; FOR EDUCATIONS
Plan that Has Much to Commend
it Now on Foot at the
State University
Hundreds of children are de
prived of an education because
their parents cannot afford to
send them to college. The ex
penditure of $300 or $400 a year
at the time the child is ready to
go to school is too much for the
average family. A plan is on
foot at the University of Florida
whereby an education will be
made possible for the great mass
of children whose parents fall in
the foregoing class.
The plan proposes to start edu
cational savings accounts in local
banks. Young parents may start
depositing when the child is a few
weeks or a year old., The. money
is not to be paid out for anything
except educational purposes
Compound interest will be paid
on the savings. A small payment
monthly during fifteen or twenty
years will provide the necessary
funds. Many parents could mak
these payments without difficulty,
but would not be able to educate
their child otherwise. The money
will bo paid in monthly install
ments when the child is ready to
attend college, or when he or she
is twenty years old. As children
approach the productive age they
can contribute toward the fund
themselves. .
Every State Needs a Similar Law
Congress is at last beginning to
move in the matter of enacting a
law that will make a partial end
at least to the tyrannous reign of
needless technicalities ln-the pro
cedure of the federal courts. Tne
bill which has been introduced is
designed to prohibit appeals on
technicalities which do not affect
the vital issues in the case and it
has been reported upon favorably
by the judiciary committee of the
House and is very likely to pass
that body. The Tarpon Springs
Leader has the following to say a-
bout it, which is well said, and
will be endorsed by a long-suffering
people who for generations
past have found their courts so
slow and ineffective in adminis
tering justice:
"Report of such a step by the
law-makers of the nation is good
news to the laymen, who, ever
and anon, are bewildered and dis
mayed at justice because of the
endless and entangling legal pos
sibilities of the laws and the
courts. Out of the practice of the
rich man to resort to the last tech
nicality before accepting convic
tion or defeat has arisen the com
mon opinion that justice in the
court is only a matter of dollars
and cents.
"Not only would such a law
curtail the numberless resorts
now possible in the courts, but it
inevitably would expedite decis
ions and justice. At present, if
the litigant has the money, he
may keep his case in the courts a
decade by resorting to one tech
nicality or another. By. such
practices the courts have been
given a reputation for general
dilatoriness and delay.
"In event of the bill becoming
a law, every State in the Union
should adopt a similar measure to
apply to State courts. We be
lieve that such a law would, to a
great extent, give to the . courts
the dignity, and respect, which
now they lack, that their import
ance should carry." Lakeland
