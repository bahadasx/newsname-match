Matter Differs.
BROKE FAITH
Asserting that "if ever there
was an impeachment of railroads
it was in the Brandcis breif,'
Frank Lyon, a Washington at
torney, who had appeared to rep
resent shippers in the rate cases
in which Mr. Brandcis took part,
extolled the Boston lawyer's ser
vice to the public and denied the
charge of Clifford Thorne that he
had ever acted in bad faith, at
the hearing today before the sub
committee of judiciary of the
Senate regarding the fitness of
Louis D. Brandeis to serve as
justice of the United States Su
preme Court.
James W. Carmalt, chief- ex
aminer of the Interstate Com
merce Commission during the
hearings of the famous .ate ccs
of 1913, asserted thht Mr.
Brandeis had been engaged, in his
opinion, to consider all phases of
the rate question, and said that
Mr. Thorne had been apprised of
the position Brandeis would take
in regard to the adequacy of the
revenues- of the roads at that time
ACCUSES BRANDEIS.
The third witness this morning w.is
Thomas C. Spelling, n New York at
torney, who charged that Branded had
exceeded Ids powers when he purported
to represent shippers in the rute case
Mr. Spelling also complained that, as at
torney for the Freight Payers' l.eagus
of the United States, he hod sent to
Mr. Brandeis a brief which wns return
ed to him from Mr. Brandeis' oftice. and
was not Included In the attorney's brief
filed with tho commission.
At the conclusion of Mr. Carmalt a
testimony S"nator AValt-h charged thai
witnesses had been alloved to.i wide a
leeway in expressing opinions, and urg
ed that they be kept down to facts. 11
said that one witness, ('. W. Bijrron, a
Boston newspaper man. he understood
had nsked to testify merely because of
an editorial he had written regarding
the fitness of Mr. Brandeis to serve on
the Supreme Court. Senator Walsh
statement brought about a colloqu
among members of tho committee as to
the breadth of discussion to be allowed
to witnesses
"I bhull protest against Senatoi
Walsh's views on the limits of tills in
quiry," said Senator Clarke. "This is
an Investigation nnd not a trial. We
aro Inquiring into the fitness of an up
lolntee, and not putting him on trial
for a misdemeanor."
Senator dimming said that Mr. Bar
ion who had been usked to appcur, ''and
invited to explain tho editorial ho
wrote," should havo un opportunity to
htate upon what facts It was based
Senator Chilton ruled, as chairman ot
the committee, that further testimony
would bo contmed as nearly as posslbu
to facts.
Mr. Carmalt took direct Issue with the
statement of Mr Thorne that the Iow.i
railroad commissioner did not know in
advance of seeing Mr. Brandeis brlcl
what position he was to take. Carmalt
said that Mr. Thorne had asked him
early In the course of the oral argu
ment what was Brandeis' position on
the adequacy of the existing revenu
of railroads and that lie, Mr. Carmalt,
had told Thorne how Mr. Hraniit-in
stood. The witness was questioned
closely as to whether he had been In
structed to Inform Mr. Thorno of this,
but lie said he had not.
Represented Both Sides.
According to Mr. Carmalt, Mr. Bran
dels had been employed by the com
mission in 191J to dovelop all sides or
tho- case, with particular stress on the
side of tho shippers and consumei-r
slnco the rullroads could take caic of
their own 'caae. He said .ho did not
consider It improper for Mr. Brandclt
to make uny statement that was fuvor
ablo to the railroads If Brandeis' in
qulrles pointed to such a conclusion
Senator Clarke questioned Mr. Carmalt
at length and to tho extent of the prep
matloii made by Mr. Brandcis for tho
