A Weekly Review
Of The Great War
The Austrian army is sweeping
down the Adriatic coast from
Oattaro without encountering
any serious resistance and at
this rate it will not be long before
Albania is practically in
their hands. The Italians were
depended upon to defend Albania
with the aid of the Serbian
solders there, since they have
always regarded Albania as
. . ^'kjj/hin their sphere of inlluence
' and fchev were already in possession
of its chief harbors, Durazzo
and Avlona. General Giovan1
ni Ameglia, who had charge of
the Italian conquest of Libya, is
in command of the Italian army
in Albania, which includes some
of the veterans of his African
campaign. He was said to have
at his command 175,000 Itlalian
troops besides the remnants of
the Serbian army which retreatI
ed into Albania, perhaps a hunI
dred thousand more. There was
I also an Albanian force of unI
known number under Essad Pa
aha, wl o might be expected to
defend Scutari against the Aus
trims as stoutly as he did
against the Montenegrins three
^B years ago. All these together
with such Montenegrins as refused
to surrender to the Austrims
would certainly havo been
Bq able to hold the Albanian mouna
tains against the invaders for a
time especially since Italy has
I command of the Adriatic and
1 would supply the armies from
| the coast while the Austrians
| and Bulgars must come a long
distance overland without railvJf-^iHK'vdS'Or
even highways back of
M. their line.
Jjfc It is no wonder then that Eng
land and France were shccked to
rfjR hear that Italy was withdrawing (
RW her troops from Durrazzo as rapidly
as possible and had apparCgently
no intention of trying to ^
* /nold any part of Albania except
^ / the port of Avlon'a. The mnnijLJ
tions and provisions which had
Hh- been stored at Durrazzo for the
campaign are being taken back ]
jr. to Italy; not to Avlona as might (
have been expected. (
The British forces on the Tigris
and Euphrates are in a very |
critical situation. A heavy and
,' long continued rainstorm, unusual
in this region, has raised the
Tigris four feet and flooded the
low banks on each side where (
the English and Indian soldiers
are encamped. The level and
barren plains adord no natural
protection and elaborate entrenchments
like those in Belgium
are impossible.
Last week we said that the relief
expedition under General
Aylmer had arrived at Essain, 1
49^-- within six miles of t he beleagured
force under General Townshend
at Kut-el-Amara. This
was the statement made to I'arliment
by Austen Chamberlin,
Sectary of State for India, but
it seems that, he was muddled in
his geography for a few days lat
er it was acknowledged that, a
.mistake had been made in the
location of / liner's army, which
Was twenty-three miles ew.ty
instead of six. Apparently tlu)
relieving army has been held in
check by strong force of Turks
near Sheik Said. The Turkish
a War ?dice reports that the British
have been driven back several
miles with a loss of thre?
th lusand. If this is true it puts
^>off indefinitely the rescue of
^ general Townshend's army,
which is entrenched at Kut-e Amara
and surrounded by the
enemy; and since this force, varionsly
surmised to number between
ten and thirty thousan 1
men, is altogether cut off from
the base of supplies at the mouth
% of the Tigris it cannot be expected
to hold out very long unless
it gets food and munition. The
Turks report the capture of a
thousand camels usod in bringing
up supplies.
Perhaps the pressure upon the
British along tho Tigris may be
relieved by the necessity of di-1
verting Turkish troops to the'
Caucasian frontier where the
Russians have taken the ofifen-1
siv>. The Grand Duke Nicholas
was placed in command of the
Caucasus when he was superseded
xby the Czar as head of the <
Russian armies in Europe after
the loss of Poland Galicia. His :
winter campaign in this new
field odouh out most, promisingly
by a westward drive that has
brought hirn within gun-shot of
Erzeruni. The Turks dislodged
by a sudden attack from the p i- ]
sition they have held for the i
past year in the mountains near ?
the border, were driven back to- ]
ward Erzerum by the Cossacks, 1
who took four thousand prisoners <

sian account the Turks were
completely routed and abandoned
tents, guns and ammunition
in enormous quantities. Erzerum
is the strongest fortified
city in eastern Turkey and formerly
stood long sieges by the
Russians. Modern artillery may
have made it more vulnerable.

Booster Chautauqua jj
A Great Event
Chesterfield's first Chautauqua
has passed into history. For
three days the town has reveled
in intellectual enjoyment. Lectures
and music, recitations and c
monologues, magic and yodling 8,
have drawn crowds to the audi- w
torium and churches. ^
An excellent program was expected
from the RadclilFe attrac- ^
bions, hut they have surpassed ^
iiur expectations. Words of f<
praise and congratulation are "
heard on every hand. Perhaps
the most frequent expression o
used is that "any one entertain- S
tuent was well worth the price t
at a season ticket."
Two excellent sermons by Dr. h
William Rader on Sunday were t:
thrown in for good measure. it
A review of the various forms b
jf the entertainment would be si
valueless- Those who attended d
Jo not need to be told wherein c<
they were entertained and bene- w
fitted and those wno failed to at- n
bend need only to be told that il
tney have missed some of the
keenest of intellectual enjoy- a
uent and inspiration to nobler f<
living. p
A very valuable and lasting b
iontribution to the three-day tx- H
srcises was the three lectures o
;iven by Messrs. Barton, Swear- p
ngen and Stevenson. South (Ja- A
olina is richly endowed with tl
balented speakers, but no better It
!ould be found within her bor- n
lers than the three gentlemen b
selected by the Committee. rr
Mr. Stevenson spoke in glow- \v
ng terms of Chesterfield's fu- tl
mre. lie urged the board of tl
trade to wake up and get busy a*
ind insisted on hearty co operation
by a11 the citizens. All the f<
speakers argued that this town tl
lould be made so attractive that. <?<
Jlrestertield's youths will be con- a
lent to remain here rather than e
?eek their fortune elsewhere and p
hat people from other sections tl
nay be induced to locate here. h
So thoioughly satisfactory was f<
this experiment that a new con- w
bvact. was made for next year
ind iustead of fifteen guarantors c
is for the last one, more than t
twenty citizens gladly signed up g
Sir next year. n

bract are: ii

Some Suggestio

The fertilizer situation has be
onie so acute owing to the
carcity of ingredents upon

ave been accusbed to depend

f Mr. T. E. Keitt, chemist for
out-h Carolina Experiment Staion
:
The standard materials that
ave formerly been used as ferilizers
are both scarce and high
i price. Many materials are
eing pressed on the market as
ubstitutes, and there is grave
anger that our farmers will beome
over enthusiastic and
aste a considerable amount of
loney at a time when they can
1 afford the loss.
Such material as land plaster
nd phospho-lime are being of*red
at comparatively high
rices. Farmers are being led to
elieve that these materials will
berate considerable quantities
f potash from the insoluble sup!y
already present in the soil.
l8 a rule, they do not realize
hat they have been applying
ind plaster for years in the acid
hosphat.e that has gone into
oth home-mixed and factorylixed
fertilizers. Therefore,
e shuold expect that most of
tie results to he derived from
his material have already been
coomplished.
The use of grcund limestone
ir the correction of acidity in
he soil and for the growth of
ertain legumes is highly desirble,
but it cannot be considerd
a "cure all", and if it is
ushed to such an extent that
here is considerable pecuniary
iss, there is* danger that its use
^r the above named purpose
'ill be reduced in the future.
Burnt lime possesses certain
haracteristics, such as flocculaion
of colloidal matter and
ranulation of clay, to a much
lore marked extent that does
round limestone. Burnt lime

Many Southern Girls
Help Their Families
Nearly 50,000 girls in the 15
Southern States were enrolled in
L015 in the girls' canning clubs
carried on cooperatively by the
State agricultural colleges and
ihe department of agriculture,
rhe purpose of these clubs is to
mcourage girls 10 to 18 years to
*row tomatoes and other vegeables
in tenth-acre gardens and
;o can their products for home
lse or for sale. Theso clubs are
inder the supervision of nearly
tOO women agents, who reprelent
jointly the Oflice of Extenion
Work, South, of the States
delations Service, and the exension
department of the several
Slate colleges.
During the first year memberhip,
those in charge find that
aring for one crop, preferably
omatoes, in a tenth-acre garden
nd selling or canning the proluct,
gives even a very amhitius
girl all the work she can do,
n the second and later years,
lowever. the girls are encourged
to raise two or three difi'ernt
kinds of vegetables in their
dots and to extend their canling
operations, as their skill
;row8, to other surplus products
f the farm, and especially to
)\p nntt.intf nn nf omoll
V?IIB Up KJA. UtliUH il Ull j
rchard fruits, and native wild
ruits, which make a palatable
r marketable product when proeased.
The principal object of
he club is to teach the gills
ow to keep the surplus fruits
nd vegetables from going to
/aste, and by canning, to make
hem a valuable addition to the
ood supply of the farm home,
specially through the winter,
ilany ambitious girls, however,
lot only put up enough canned
;oods and jir3 of fruit for home
lonsumption, but make a tidv
nonetary profit besides. While
he figures of profits for 1015 are
lot yet compiled, it is known
hat in 1014, 7,70.1 canning-club
[iris who renered full reports of
heir work put up 1,018,024 cans,
ars, and other containers of
ruits and vegetables, which
vere worth, according to conservative
estimates, $284,880, of
vhich nearly $200,000 could be j
:redited to profit. It is estimat-j
id that the average profit per
nomlipr wna MO 'I'liooo licr-!
ires of course, do not include
:he products of many thousands !
)f children who failed to send in
iccnrate reports but who, it is
tnown, raised and canned thousands
of dollars worth of products
irom their own gardens and from
dieir faithers' truck patches.
Many of the better-trained
dub members, not content with
die raising of gardens during
:he summer, have taken up
gardening in the winter where
dimatic conditions were suit-1
ible. Many of them are grow !
ing such vegetables as spinach, |
lauliilower, lettuce, endive, as-1
paragus and celerv, some of
which were entirely now to the
^irls who have taken them up.
Here is the 6tory of an 11 year3ld
Virginia club girl who, 011
November 16, 1014, began a winter
garden 20 feet wide and 50
feet long, which was a part of
her tenth-acre garden cultivated
the previous summer. Spinach,
lettuce, radishes, rape, kale, and
mustard were planted in Novemhor

She gathered in alP.%7 pounds
of vegetables and sold from h,jr

800 cabbage plants, and -100 tomato
plants. This crop ".'as
worth $17.05. She writes: "My

The "Perils" continue to grow

and the yillians grow more daring
and determined in the efforts
to take the life of the beautiful
heroine.
The scenes of the fifth episode,
apearing next Tuesday evening,
move from a fashionable New

the scene of many unsolved
murder mysteries.
It will be remembered that it
was amid these scenes that Elsie
