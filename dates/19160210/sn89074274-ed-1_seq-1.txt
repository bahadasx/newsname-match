THE WEEKLY TIMES-RECORD
Bismarck Plays High
School Here Saturday
The Bismarck high school basket
ball team comes here Saturday eve
ning for a contest with the local quin
tet. The defeat at the hands of
Jamestown brought out many .weak
points in the team which have been
hammered for the last week. That
was the first close game the boys had
been in this year and as a result were
not used to the rushing game put up
by the Jamestown boys.
Bismarck comes here with the repu
tation of having a strong and fast
bunch, having been defeated only once
this season, and are expected to put up
as hard a fight as the boys have had
this year.

On account of the heavy program

that it would be necessary for him to
resign as organist and choir master at
the Epworth M. E. church, a position
he has filled since coming to Valley
City last summer. This action on the
part of Mr. Woodhams has been made
necessary because of the increase in
the number of music pupils enrolled in

The attorney general office through
its assistant, Mr. Stevenson, maintains
that it would first have to pass upon
any such complaint and therefore
could not make a complaint. Fred B.
Snyder, another member of the board,
declined to take action himself.
Mr. Snyder declared that in his opin
ion the state treasurer should have
.resigned before this. Preus thought
.that the treasurer should be given a
hearing. The government explained
that in the event a complaint is filed
a committee be appointed to take evi

evidence supports a charge of mal
