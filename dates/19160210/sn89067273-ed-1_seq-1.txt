NOTHER GOOD LETTER.
Striking for Higher Things- Train
ing in Agriculture.
-Mexico, Mo., Fedruary 7, 1916.
Mr.John Beat, Dear Editor:
I was very much pleased to' see the
old Hedge Dale picture in the Mes
sage again. It was very kind indeed
of you to publish it, and I sincerely
appreciate your kind interest toward
us.
We are all enjoying the good old
farm life, and are trying to get the
most profitable necessities thru our
country and High School days.
Our faces and appearances may be
the same, with a very few changes,
but we are advancing daily in knowl
edge, and are beginning to realize
the golden opportunities which lie be
fore us.
We realize that success on any of
our good Audrain county farms
must be the result from a good edu
cation with an agricultural founda
tion.
Growing pure-bred farm crops and
raising pure-bred live stock is a sci
entific factor for prosperity.
Our ambitions are to strike for
the higher things, believing that per
severance and patience will win for
us our aims and groat desires in the
end.
Yours truly,
RAYMOND S. SNOOK.

Mc Mlllan I toils Sedalia And Klrkn
vllle in Ifaiftkct Itnll. '
By Fred Lavender.
"On ward.McMlHanHigh ! Marching
to the StatechamplonBhlp." Defeating
Sedalia and Ktrksville In a big double
header Saturday night is her latest
achievement in basket ball. Seda
lia High Sshool was supposed to be the
Fast, and able to hold his own W
greatest obstacle in the way of the
fighting McMillan quintette; But Sat
urday night at Hardin Gym the honib
boys Just lacked two points of doub
ling the score on the fast Sedalia
team, the final being 38 - 20. Th'e
second game of the double heador
with Kirksville was taken by a
20-16 score.
The "big five" was in good con
dition, and played a great game
against Sedalia. They were fast and
had splendid team work and lots of
fight. . They started the scoring and
had seven points before Sedalia made
a goal. Each time Sedalia threw a
goal, McMillan immediately followed
v.ith two or three to offset their op
ponents' gain. The half ended in fa
vor of the crimson and gray boys
sometimes called bull-dogs because
of their energy and fight, 20-10.
The' game was a good clean exhi
bition of basket ball and was one of
the most interesting games played
here this year. Joy Kistler and Ry
lan Rhodes wtre unfortunate in that
they were each "knocked out" but
Coach Rich, armed with a wet towel
and administering first aid to the
injured, sonn had them on their feet
Captain Morris Keath was unable
to play but Sam Locke ably filled Lis
plaee at left forward and. played a
star game. J Sain Is a hard figuter.
fast, and able to hold his owh be
cause of his strength. He is the best
utility player McMillan has had for
several years, as he can play .guard
or forward, and is a star in any place
An injured knee, which kept him
out of practice the first few
games of the season, is the only
thing that prevented him from mak
ing the regular team.
Joy Kistler played his usual great
game. He had his eye on the basket
and made several good shots. Once
he shot a goal from the center of the
long Hardin gym. He shot free
goals without a single miss. Rodes,
Atchison and Cunningham each play
ed an excellent game.
The Second Game.
The second team was started against
Kirksville, and did well, considering
the size of their opponents. The
score at the end of the first half was
a tie 6-6. Kirksville played better
in the second half, and it was neces
sary to send in the first team play
ers to save the game.
Tho the Kirksville boys were not
skillful players, they were very large
and old, and our second team boys,
two of whom are freshmen, deserve
much praise. They had the best
team work and played real basket
ball. Their line up was O. Austin and
H. Shoush, forwards; M. Towson and
J. Kearns, guards, L. Wonneman,
center.,
Mr. Campbell refereed both games.
Tho Hardin gym was packed with
rooters who cheered wildly as Seda
lia and Kirksville were being beaten
by the speedy McMillan boys. Many
of the older people of the town who
have never been followers of the
game, until this season, were present
and their "pep" was equal to that of
the younger people, f McMillan at
tracts the attention, not only with
her athletics, but with her live school
spirit and good work In general Mex
ico people are awakened to the fact
that McMillan High School is an in
stitution to be proud of.
Sednlla has had a very successful
season excepting for two defeats.
Warrensburg High school defeated

Mrs. Corner Tells of Prohibition and
of the Weather and Her Chics.
By kind permission of Mr. E. F.
Kunkel of this city we are permitted
to make the following excerpts from
a letter recently written him by his
sister, Mrs. Grace Corner, of Colfax,
Wash. Mrs. Cornur was a former
resident of Mexico.
The 2nd of February and there is
an 11 inch snow on the ground. It
lias been snowing for 36 hours. The
trains are tied up in the mountain
regions. The weather Is hard on
game and birds, as well as folks who
are In need of fuel. The fuel dealers
are unable to get cars thru, and the
situation bids fair to become serious.
We are now living in a saloonless
towh. Great experience, too. Trade
is picking up. In the cities they find
it difficult to get washwomen since
the dry law has gone into effect. The
former boozers are now not only self-
suporting but also suport their fami
lies. The prosecuting attorneys from all
over the State met at the Capital to
ny and have decided to arrest for
hear beer as well as for the real ar
ticle, If there are violations. So you
see we are strictly prohibition. Only
three persons in the county Jail at
present and none inthe city Jail.

TO BEAUTIFY P. O. GROUNDS.
The Mexico Postoffice Building Is
one of the finest in the country, and
beauty thru the summer months ia to
be added thereto.
In accordance with instructions
from the Treasury Department, pro
posals are being solicited for the
planting of trees, shrubs and clinging
vines on the grounds of the Mexico
Post Office building. The'plans and
specifications call for such landscape
work as will be necessary in beautify
ing the grounds to the greatest pos
sible degree. Postmaster Jackson, as
the Custodian of the building for the
Treasury Department, has requested
proposals from local landscape gard
eners and it is quite likely that bids
on the work will be submitted by
firms from other cities who make this
kind of work a specialty.
