fred Boudreaux and John Arnolie.
both the State and the Railway Com
pany testified that the claims of the
railroad were sustained by the facts.
Two cents did not pay the cost of
carrying a passenger a mile. The
State, however, contended that the
railroad was earning enough surplus
on its state freight business to give a
fair return upon the capital used in
its passenger as well as its freight
business. For the purposes of the
case, the railroad did not deny this,
but held to its contention that the
State could not segregate its pas
senger business for rate fixing with
out allowing a rati that would be
sufficient to pay the cost of doing
business and enough to give some
return upon the capital invested in
doing the business regulated. This
was the issue presented to the Su
preme Court. Its decision responds
to the judgment of the fair-minded
sentiment of the country. The Su
preme Court says that, even though
a railroad earns a surplus on a par
ticular commodity by charging rea
sonable rates, that affords no reason
for compelling it to haul another's
person or property for less than cost.
The surplus from a reasonable rate
properly belongs to the railway com
pany. If the surplus is earned from
an unreasonable rate then that rate
should be reduced. The State may
not even up by requiring the railroad
to carry other traffic for nothing or
for less than cost.
The decision is a wholesome one
and demonstrates that the ordinary
rules of fair dealing apply to railway
companies. The fact that one makes
a surplus on his wheat crop would
never be urged as a reason for com
poelling him to sell his cotton at less
than cost. It would not satisfy the
man who wanted bread to be told
that its high price enabled the cotton
manufacturer to get his raw product
for less than cost In this case the
court reaffrmed the homely maxim
that each tub maust stand apon its
own bottm."

sttr. while the night watchman was
making hi< rounds of the uper flotors. I
and alfter the store had hteen opene:l
!Saturday morning itoldly walkettl out.
Lenore mlight he at liberty now if
he had removed a certain card from
the discarded overall. which he left
in the store after fitting himself out in
new apparel from head to feet. This
clue led to his capture Saturday night
in the Stone Front saloon in Algiers
by Harry S. Michel, superintendent of
the Boylan Detective Agency.
When Albert Godchaux came down
to his store Saturday morning ihe
discotered that his desk had been
opened and a Colt's pistol was miss
ing. A short while afterwards a clerk
discovered the overalls which Lenore
had left behind after attiring himself
in new clothing. Later in the day an
other bundle of his old shoes, hat,
socks and shirt was discovered hidden
in the store.
Mr. Michel anti a Boylan operative
went to work on the case. The only
clue was a card of the Stone Front
saloon.
Mr. Michel went to the Sto ne Front
saloon andt conversed with Bartender
Dannehauser. As soon as he stated
his mission I)annehauser said: "Why.
I was just starting to call Superintend
ent Reynolds when yot came in: here's
the pistol right here. and that man
sitting over there just handed it to
tie a few minutes ago."
Mir. Michel telephoned Mr. Reynolls
attd two Itlain lIothes men were sent
to work with him. Lenore was sized
tilt as a hard proposition atnd a watth
was kept on him until the other offi
cers arrived. tIe was surprised when
plaedt under ar'est, becatne surly and
refused to talk. Later, however, ae.
cording to tie oftiters. lie decided to
talk and related the aceount of his
robbery.
lie also attempted to oeten the pri
vatefe safe of Mr. Godchaux. Ie said
he walked into the store Priday after
noon as if to purchase something anti
secreted himself in one of the cur
tained dressing rooms in the men's
tlothing department. changing his hid
ing place a number of times to avoid
detection.
Lenore showed sympathy for his
feet by passing over the stock of shoes
in boxes and taking a pair which had
been on stretchers for a month, ant,
whit h fitted him perfectly.
