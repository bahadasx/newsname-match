Ten per cent of the deaths in the
United States result from pneumonia.
It is estimated that during the past 30
thirty days this rate has been doubled
in some sections. Tuberculosis and
heart disease, each causing one-ninth
of all the fatilities, are- the only di
seases which outrank pneumonia
among the legion of the men of death,
but in certain cities pneumonia is
steadily increasing and even has sur
passed the mortality from tuberculos
is. Seventy per cent of all cases oc
cur between December and May. It
is a distinctly cold weather infection.
Seemingly brought on by wintry
blasts, but especially prevalent during
.the winter season only because its vic
tims are rendered more susceptible at
-that time by exposure, debilitating in
fluences and the presence of predis
posing infections.
Pneumonia principally affects those
at the extremes of life, but no age is
«xempt. It is invariably a germ di
sease. The predisposing and excit
ing organisms are so numerous that
it would be futile to attempt their en
umeration. Many of them are con
sistantly present in the mouths and
throats of healthy persons and it is
only thru the aid which we unfitting
ly extend to them that they are trans,
formed into harmless organisus to one
of man's most powerful enemies.
The presence of other diseases is the
great predisposing cause of pneumon
ia. They prepare the soil for invas
ion. Holding first rank in this cata
gory is influenza, the increased inci

dence of pneumonia at this time being
largely due to the present epidemic of
la grippe. Individuals suffering from
this infection are peculiarly suscepti
ble to respiratory complications and
^should properly ..observe every hygenic
rule. Inflamation of the upper air
passages, pharyngitis, bronchitis, and
tonsillitis, often predispose to the de
velopment of the disease particularly
among the aged and infirm. The acute
.contagious deseases of childhood, more
especially measles and the whooping
cough, frequently prepare the way for
pneumonia. Anyone who thru neg
lect or carelessness permits the spread
of these infections is therefore open
to the severest condemnation. Ex
hausting disease of whatever nature
is often sufficient to so reduce our re
sistance that we are unable to cope
with organisms which should be easily
overcome, and hence predisposes to
the infection.
Debility, either temporary or chron
ic, developing from any cause, increas
es susceptibility. Because of this the
disease most often attacks those at
the extremes of life. Among debili
tating influences must be mentioned
cold, exposure to penetrating winds,
and the chilling of body surfaces as a
result of wetting. The combination of
lack of food and fatigue proves par
ticularly disastrous during the winter
season and is a condition to be avoid
ed whenever possible. Bad housing
mental and physical harrassment, and
overwork are alike the advance agents
of the infection. Overcrowding, in
street cars, theatres, and other public
places, is unquestionably in part re
sponsible for the spread of pneumonia
in cities, as far greater opportunity
is thus offered for the dissemination of
the predisposing diseases through in
discriminate coughing and other
means of droplet infection, as well as
the directly injurious effects which in
evitably result from exposure of such
environment. The overheating of
rooms is also seemingly harmful.
Promiscuous expectoration may be,
and probably is, a factor in infection
and consequently should be avoided by
every citizen. A remaining most im
portant agent should be mentioned—
alcohol. It is in truth the handmaiden
of pneumonia, and there is none more
certain or more sure of success, espec
ially if liberally and continuously used.
While the foregoing facta constitute
in part our knowledge of the reasons
for the widespread dissemination of an
infection which carries with it a mor
tality of from ten to thirty per cent,
it should be remembered that our
scientific data are not yet complete.
There are problems connected with
immunity, predisposition, and the oc
currence of epidemics which are yet
to be solved. It is known that pneu
monia frequently attacks those who
are perfectly well, and who have ap
parently observed every hygenic rule.
Whether this rule is due to increased
virulence of the organism or to other
..•V
\?%A h-F''''* 'Y'*" ,"u'''--
causes is unexplained. It is, however,
recognized that avoidance of the fac
tors so briefly enumerated will in a
large part diminish individual suscep
tibility and therefore the incidence of
the disease.

TOO BIG FOR
THE MURINE!
Pittsburg, Pa., Feb. 2.—Michael Tu.
holski, a steel mill puddler from
Cleveland, Ohio, aged 22 years, was
today rejected at the United States
Marine Corps recruiting station in this
city, as "too big and husky" for the
Marine Corps.
Tuholski measured six feet and five
inches in his stocking feet and weigh
ed 257 pounds without clothing. The
medical examiner pronounced him a
perfect physical specimen, but the
maximum height is 73 inches and no
giants or pigmies are wanted in the
Marine Corps, according to Sergeant
Michael DeBoe, who is in charge of
the local recruiting station for sea sol
diers.
The giant recruit, who says he is no
white hope and has no desire to meet
Jess Willard or Frank Moran, will re
sume puddling in the mills, he told
DeBoe when the latter rejected him.

FRONT SEAT IS
it
Among the features of the new ser
ies 17 Studebaker cars that are at
tracting much attention are the divid
ed front seats on both the four-cylin
der and six-cylinder seven passenger
models.
Not only are these front seats di
vided and of the individual type, but
they are also adjustable fore and aft.
Another novel feature is that the seats
may be removed if the driver desires,
an advantage that is particularly ap
preciated during the open touring
season, when many motorists like to
camp out in their cars over night.
By reason of the fore and aft ad
justment, passengers of any size may
be comfortably accommodated in the
front seats. The adjustment process
is a simple one, requiring only the re
leasing or tightening of a set screw.
Setting the seat at its maximum dis
tance to the rear provides seating
comfort for the tallest driver, and set
ting it forward is a convenience for
the benefit of drivers of smaller size.
When the seats are removed, it is
possible to iay a cot from front to
rear, for purposes of camping out.
On cool summer nights' the side cur
tains may be drawn and ventilation
supplied through the double ventilat
ing windshield. On warm nights :ie
curtains are not necessary. Thus,
motorist can get away from sleep
in a stuffy room on warm nights, and
yet accorded ample protection on
cool nights.
A further use is that, when the front
seat next to the driver is removed,
the car can be employed to carry
bulky .articles .such .?s small wagons
or baby carriages, which otherwise
would be difficult to handle. Subur
banites particularly find this an ad
vantage.
In addition to their utilitarian val
ue, the divided front seats are design
ed with an eye to comfort. An en
gineer, after visiting a recent automo
bile show and making it a point to sit
in the different cars, praised the Stud
ebaker for its front seat comfort.
CIRLS KILLED
In a tragedy at Deming, N. M., the
three daughters of Edward R. Val
landingham, former newspaper pub
lisher at Northwood, N. D., and Wim
bledon, N. D., were killed, Valland
ingham was seriously injured, and a
business associate was fatally hurt.
The accident occurred when the Val
landingham automobile was struck by
a Santa Fe train. Vallandingham was
publisher of the Head Light, the'lead

AND INTER- OCEAN
THE CAT CAME BACK
Frederick H. Cowell of New Lon
don, Conn., express messenger on the
Central Vermont railroad, has given
a home for life to a tramp cat of un
known breed. Efforts to induce her
to take up her residence elsewhere in
the city had been futile, and Mr.
Crowell was asked to remove her be
yond the city limits, even unto the
borders of Massachusetts.
He consented, and placing her in a
bag, took her on board the train and
at Mansfield, forty-eight miles away,
laid the bag carefully down on the
station platform as the train pulled
out. Four days later that same, id
entical, unmistakable cat appeared at
Mr. Crowell's door and asked for her
breakfast. By her bedraggled appear
ance, she had walked the long dis
tance.

BILL PASSED
E
KEATING MEASURES BAR GOODS
PRODUCED BY MINORS UNDER
14 FROM INTERSTATE COM­
MERCE.
Washigton, Feb. 9.—The Keating
bill barring from interstate commerce
the products of child labor was passed
by the house yesterday, 337 to 46, and
now goes to the Senate.
It imposes heavy penalties for in
terstate shipment and commodity in
whole or in part by children under 14
years working in mills, canneries,
workshops or manufacturig establish
mets.
Where children are employed at
night or more than eight hours a day
in this latter class of industries, the
minimum age is 16 instead of 14.
Opposition to the bill came largely
from the South. Representative Webb
of North Carolina, chairman of the
House judiciary committee, urged that
it was unconstitutional, and sought
successfully to exemptt he children of
widows from its operation.
Former Speaker Cannon offered an
amendment to exempt canneries, be
cause of competition with the canner
ies across the Canadian line, where no
i3. triction on child labor applies. The
material change mde in the adoption
of an amendi^n' to -xempt the boys
and girls' canim^

STATE PATRIOTISM
DE DOPING.
As North Dakota grows older, state
patriotism develops and the tendency
to support home institutions becomes
stronger. Constantly new institutions
to serve our own people are being de
veloped in the state. At Grand Forks
recently one of the indications of this
was noted when the Great Northern
Life Insurance Company held its an
nual meeting and elected E. J. Larder
a former president of the North Da
kota Federation of Commercial Clubs,
to its presidency. The Great North
ern Life Insurance Company is a
North Dakota institution, with North
Dakota men in charge of it and North
Dakota capital behind it, and as such
it is receiving the support of Norlh
Dakota people.
FORCES IN PERSIA DEFEATED
BY TRIBESMEN— FRENCH PO
SITIONS TAKEN.
Berlin, Feb. 9.—Constantinople re
ports, announced by the Overseas
News Agency, state that the Russian
forces in Persia have met with a se
vere defeat at the hands of Persian
tribesmen and that they retreated in
disorder.
French Lines Taken.
Berlin, Feb. 9.— The capture of the
first line of the French positions over
a front of 8C0 yards to the west of
Vimy, was announced today by the
war office.
REAL PROSPERITY IS HERE
That the coming year will be the
most prosperous that has been enjoyed
by the United States in many years
seems to be the general opinion of
those who are in the best position to
know. The Chamber of Commerce of
the United States has just made pub
lic thru its National Councilor for
North Dakota, who is located at Grand
Forks, its General Crop and Business
Conditions report prepared by a spec
ial committee of the Chamber. This
report outlines conditions fully. In
part it states that the crop yields in
general, other than cotton, exceed
those of any year known in o^r his
tory. This is true in especial of the
small grains as a whole, and is par
ticularly true of all the forage crops
which are in abundance beyond pre
cedent. This latter fact is one that is
most significant and of very large mo
ment to the country as a whole.
The acreage sown to winter wheat
is about 12% per cent less than that
of last year at this time, and the con
dition is not quite so good.
There is more livestock in the un
try at this time than for the same
time last year, despite the unfavora
ble condition reported in certain sec
tions of the Northwest. This increase
iu numbers is accounted for to a large
extent by the prices which have been
remunerative to the producer, and by
the great abundance of cheap food.
Mining in all forms shows marked
improvement over the conditions pre
vailing a year ago. This is particu
larly true of copper, iron, lead ai. 1
zinc or spelter. Coal mining lags be
hind but is slowly getting better.
Oil and gas industries have exper
ienced a very great revival because cf
much higher prices, especially 'n oil.
Manufacturing has taken on new
life through tie whole country and in
almost every branch.
The lumber business which seemed
dead for seveivl years appears only to
have been sleeping. It is improving
slowly throughout the entire coun
try, but especially in the yellow-pine
district of the south.
One of the most significant facts of
the day is great activity in retail
trade.
While money is plentiful and rates
are not high, there is wide difference
in the ease or the lack of ease with
which it can be obtain 3d, and this diff
erence seems to be largely due to local
conditions. As a whole, however, it
is not difficult to get money from the
banks on good collateral for legitimate
purposes.
The outlook for business for the
first four months of 1916 is in strik
ing contrast to that prevailing this
time last year.

PASSES AWAY
A WELL ROUNDED LIFE SPENT
IN UNSELFISH SERVICE FOR
OTHERS.
Mrs. Kriste Nestegard was born
April 30, 1834, in the town of Halling
dal, Norway, and came to this state in
the earl eighties and with her husband
who survives her, settled on a farm in
Big Coulee township where they lived
about thirty years.
In the land of her birth was also
bom the boy who some day by the
mysteries of love, was to discover the
sweet spirit that was to be his bride,
and when the years rolled around
they were united in happy wedlock.
For almost sixty years these two
walked together the way of life.
Her old friends and neighbors speak
of her as a beautiful christian lady,
faithful in all the relations of life, un
til now, in ripened years, with life
well finished, she has gone into the
home prepared for the faithful. Her
many friends and neighbors will
greatly miss her in the community
where she has lived so many years.
The love and esteem in which she was
held by the ladies of Big Coulee con
gregation was shown by the beautiful
wreath which they laid on the casket.
She passed away very peacefully on
Tuesday morning, Jan. 25, leaving of
the immediate family to mourn her
death, the aged husband, Ole S. Nes
tegard daughter, Mrs. C. T. Studness
sons Lars O., Sander O., and Knute.
The funeral services were held in Big

NOTES FROM
Washington, Feb. 5,—(Special.)—
Senator McCumber has come to the
relief of Christian Fredrickson of Ray,
Williams Co., N. D., so that Fred
rickson will be permitted to receive
patent on a 160 acres he entered near
Ray some years ago. It seems that
when Fredrickson entered upon this
land, he had previously entered upon
80 acres in Minnesota which he stated
in his application, and also had en
tered upon 55 acres near Minot which
he also stated. These statements were
with his papers when he made his fi
nal proof on the 160 acres after hav
ing lived on the land seven years.Hov-.
ever, when it came to issue a patent
to him the fact that he had already re
ceived patent for 80 and 55 acres was
discovered, which ordinarily would
bar him from taking his 160 acre
homestead near Ray. However, the
Secretary of the Interior, Franklin K.
Lane, promptly took the position that
a failure to act upon this information
by his department in years passed,
should not work an injustice to Fred
rickson, and the matter was called to
the attention of Senator McCumber.
The Senator has introduced a bill au
thorizing the issuance of a patent on
this land which will result in merely
aiding justice to a settler who did
nothing that was not entirely above
board and fair.
