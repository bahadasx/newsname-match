Sunday evening the church was the

Cheaper Lights, New Schools, Fire Station, Fine
Streets and Cheaper Insurance For Bogalusa
Citizens Almost Unanimous In Making Improvements Which Will Make Bogalusa City She Is
Entitled To Be---Per Capita Tax Is Fixed At $5 For the Year Of 1916--Municipal
Ownership Was Greatly Favored and Extensions of Sewer and
Water Will Be Carried To Every Part of the City and
Council Instructed to Call For
$200,000 Bond Issue
The Mai s Meeting which was held s
at the Y. M. C. A., last Friday even-I
ing for the purpose of discussing the
$200,000 bond issue and the
manner in which the money was to
be expended as well as other im
provements. was attended by a
large number of people and the
meeting was marked by the fact
that apparently the entire audience t
was in iavor of the proposi
tions, as recommended by th Investi-,
gation Committee. t
The meeting was called to order t
i by Mayor Sullivan, who after a short
talk outlined the plans.
PER CAPITA TAX OF $5
The first question to dispose of
was the raising of the per capita
tax from $2 to $5 per year. It was
s stated that with this tax raised the
streets of Bogalusa could be greatly
t' improved as it would give this de
g partment of the city $20,190, pro
e viding that everyone paid this tax.
it It was announced that there were
1758 white men in Bogalusa between
is the ages of 18 and 55 and 25001
e negroes between the same ages who ++
would come under a per capita or
diance. During the 30 minutes al-j m
1e lowed for the discussion of the shi
s question, Ex-Gov. Sanders made an
le interesting address on the necessity
r- and costs of good roads. "Give me Fil
it the money that you are now paying an
in for your streets and I will build the
If streets of Creosoted Pine Blocks in
ls over every road in Bogalusa" said alh
k- the Ex Governor. "Don't misunder- foI
stand me" he exclaimed. "Give me wi
at what you are paying now and I give lei
a you the Creosoted pine block streets, in
I don't mean the amount you are cil
as paying to the city but the amount n,
it is costing you for snew buggies, p,
'er new harness, new horses and mules,
d's new shoes, lost time, broken springs
He ects. You are paying the price and
Idr are not getting streets. Pay the cw
or money into the city that you are W
of now expending and we will be able s
of to have these streets." Mr. Sanders W
had the audience in an excellent tl
w- mood which continued for the re- W
de- mainder of the evening. A few in id
ian the audience thought that a $5 tax q
est was too high but when the vote was q
ing taken they were overwhelmingly T
of out voted. Commissioner of Public ti
the Highway Cowgill made a short but
ere interesting talk on the cost of im
ath proving the streets, what had been 1
the done and what remained to be ac- °
Scomplished. He stated that when
lii they had the road from the Bogalusa s
iat Stores Co., to the depot completed
you it would cost about $3500,00. There i
are 12 miles more of streets in I
to B' dalusa that he hopes to hav-e in I
and the same condition as the new road. I
tin BARBER SHOPS TO CLOSE I
day The question of passing an or
will I diance for the closing of all barber
m., shops in the city of Bogalusa on
,e Sunday was next discussed and on I
7:30 a vote it carried by a larger majority
One than the per capita tax. An ordi
ance will be introduced at the next

REDUCING INSURANCE
Sol Trueblood, of the Louisiana M.
Fire Prevention Bureau, was present as
and stated that if the city took over in
the water system and made the 19
improvements as outlined that Bog
alusa would be advanced from a M
fourth class to a second class city ci
which would mean a saving of at in
least 25 to 33 1-3 percent on the- h
insurance rate and would save the st
city not less than $12,500 annually,
not including the Great Southern y,
properity. F

committee was read, the Board b,

this Mayor Sullivan asked anyone r

details of the proposition to ask any p
question they saw fit. A few minor Ii
1 questions were asked and discussed.
Time was allowed any arguments
I that anyone had to offer either for
or against the proposition. Mayorý
. Sullivan then stated that if there
1 10 business men in the city who
Ilopposed the bond issue that he
