Between France and the United

other, nor grasps the full significance
of what the other is fighting for.
This is one's Impression following
a trip through the east, west and
south, made to get in touch with some
conditions after being with the allies
in France since the beginning.of the
war.
While officialdom seems to appre
ciate America's position fully, the
French man-in-thc-street says "Amer

way he says it that he thinks the
United States stands for peace-and

WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.—Austria
must explain to the United States why
one of her submarine commanders
stopped the American ship Petrolite,
a Standard Oil tanker, In eastern
Mediterranean waters, and helped
himself to stores aboard.
In making this announcement to
day, Secretary Lansing said the
request for explanation was not a
"note," but he said also that "perhaps
there may be demands made later."
Request for Information and an in
vestigation, It was learned today, is
based on affidavits received by mail
from Captain Thompson of the Petro
lite, wh!clt supplemented naval af
fidavits and which cleared up the
question of the Identity of the sub
marine. Captain Thompson's affidavits
to the state department set forth that
he was bound from Alexandria to
Philadelphia. He said the Petrolite
was flying the stars ana stripes and
had her name and nationality painted
in huge white letters on her side.
While he was below deck, Thompson
swore he was startled by the sound
of a shot. He rushed to the bridge
and stopped the ship. One man, a
Dane, was wounded by a shot flrpd
after the ship stopped.
When the submarine ran alongside,
the Austrian commander asked
Thompson to sell some provisions.
Thompson refused. The Austrian
commander is said to have replied:
"We'll take them any way." Then,
according to Thompson, an American
seaman was taken on board the sub
marine as a hostage while the AUB
