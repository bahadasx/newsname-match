Hi
David I- Go'dstein Presents Sub
ject From Catholic Viewpoint
UNDER AUSPICES OF K CF C
Well Attended Lecture on Great Prob
lem at High School Hall Last
Evening.
Declaring that "the world will not
have peace at the price or peace, anu
so nations are deluged with blood,"
David Goldstein, formerly . socialist
and now traveling loeturer for the
Knights of Columbus, made a strong
argument lu high school hall lust eve
ning for a return to the principles of
Christ and the Catholic church as a
Folution of the problem of peace and
war.
On the platform were several offici
als of the local K. of C. council, Pat
tick J. I'cndergast, Grand Knight;
V. E. Sears, Deputy Grand Knight;
Joseph Cunning, financial secretary;
D. T. Murray, recording secretary; D.
A. Guiltinan, advocate; John Nash, A.
C. LaMarre and State Senator Ed
mund LaFranchise. Tho speaker was
introduced by Frank E. Howe. An
audience of about 3no people were
present.
Mr. GolJiitcin dealt, with the subject
of peace and war as it applies to the
individual, the family, tho industrial
life and the governmental relatlon-
giipSgiving the Christian position
in contract to that held by radicals.
In dealins; with national and Interna
tional peace Mr. Goldstein said, in
part: 13jid will, denying Gods law
and setting up our own in our domes
tic and commercial relations, ia no
foundation for national peace. Just
so loni; as there is national greed,
envy and Jealousy, just bo long shall
the clash of . amis be heard, and the
only peace we shall nave win 00
armed peace, with its ever increasing
burden of taxation. This being so, tho
maintenance of an army and a navy
s a necessity today. But every time
we see a regiment or a battle ship it
should ho a reminder of our personal
and national disobedience to the lnw
of Christ. It is indeed an evidence of
Man's inhumanity to man that makes
countless millions mourn."
Tho world will not have peace at
he price of peace, and eo nations are
deluged with blood. It is interesting
to note that those who deny the power
of the Church, cannot forget ner
claims. Ever since the outbreak of
tho European war, I have been fre
quently questioned as to the contra
diction between the law of the Catho
lic church and the nets of Catholics.
They want to know how it is that the
Catholic church says: "Thou shalt
not kill" and yet, in the armies of tho
opposing nations at war, Catholics are
found killing one another? Why. as
the law of the Catholic church is
aguinst killing, docs not Rome put a
stop to the war by calling upon tho
Catholics of the several nations at
war to refuse to fight?
Questions of this character as often
show a sincere ignorance of the law
and the power of the church as they
do hostility to her. What seems . to
some genuine lovers of p(ace to be a
plain contradiction between the law
of Catholics and the acts of Catholics
quickly gives place to comuion-senso
view, when the facts in the case are
pointed out to them. Of course the
insincere man holds the self-same
perverse opinion even after the plain
est of answers. "Thou shalt not kill"
is indeed tho law of God, and the
Church is the divine interpreter of
tho law. The Church says: "Thou j
shalt not kill.'' But, interpreting the
law, the Church says that you and I
have a right to our life; that, if an
enemy, out of revenge, or if a mad
man threatens our existence, we may
cut him down, and the law "Thou
shalt net kill" is not violated. The
Church teaches that the State has a
right to its life; that the State has a
right to maintain and to perfect that
life U then, the State takes in battle
the life of an invader, the law "Thou
shalt not kill" is not violated. The
state may enter the territory of her
enemy, making war to compel the set
tlement of her just claims, and the
law "Thou shalt not kill" is not vio
lated. So it is that the interpretation
of God's law meets with the assent of
right-minded men. For it rests upon
the principle of justice, not upon
sentimentality more or less sound or
sickly. The mind of the Catholic
Church x robust, wholesome, Bound.
While the Church says there is such
a thing as a just war she knows that
some day, some way, God will puniHh
thoVe nations that wage unjust war,
for tho State is morally bound to obey
the law of God.
Is the European war a Just war?
The Church has no answer. The right
to answer belongs to the State. The
justice of her resort to arms the State
herself must determine. The Church
will not be tempted. Jt was the
enemies of Christ who asked: "Shall
we pay tribute to Caesar7" tempting
Him. Just so does the enemy question
the Church today. And the same
answer is given that her Divine
Founder gave nearly twenty centuries
ago: "Render to Caesar the things
that are Caesar's, and to God the
things that &re God's." Then, one
thing that belongs to Caesar is obedi
ence to the call of the State, for loyal
ty to our own colors Is not alone a
civil claim upon us, It is the law cf
the Church.
Jt is the irony of fute that though
the enemy profcsscB to see in the man
who gives allegiance to the Pope of
Homo a traitor to his country, the
Catholic Church teaches tho highest
possible order of patriotism. Whllo
the eelf-styled Guardians of .Liberty
froth at the mouth when manufactur
ing facts that are not so, the real facts
tell the tale that Catholics are to bo
found amongst the bravest of the
of Christendom.
Besides, it is most interesting to
note that those who have cried the
loudest that a man cannot be a loyal
Englishman, Frenchman, German or
American and pay tribute to the Popo,
because Rome interferes with matters
of State, are now Insistently asking
why the Pope does not interfere with
matters of State and stop the war.
The strict neutrality of the Holy
Father throws back the IiibuU that
the Church is a political machine.
And the patriotism of Catholics
should for all time silence their tra
ducers, for while they are obedient to
the Popo, In matters of faith and mor
als, Catholics are loyally and heroi
cally giving up their lives at the best
of the several countries at war. But,
to expect the enemy to cease quest
ioning our patriotism is too much, for
so long as men follow the counsels of
ill-will, so long must Catholics expect
to be maligned. In answer to those
who questioned his patriotism, upon
his elevation to the xalted position
of a Prince of the Church, our own
great Cardinal O'Conncll said:
"Since when was a man not permitted
to love both his Father and his
Mother? Since wheii. was a man not
permitted to obey his God and his
Country?" ,
Tho Catholic Church holds the key
to a World Peaco today! Just as she
brings peace to the Soul of the repen
tent sinner, just as 6he reconciles the
diilorences between man and wife, no
has she settled disputes between King
and King, nation and naliou. It was
Boniface VIII who established peace
between Fiance and England. It was
Alexander VI who adjusted the differ
ences between Spain and Portugal
over their new-found Western lands.
It was Clement VII who settled the
differences between Russia and Po
land over Lithuania. It was Gregory
XIII. who ended the war between
Bathory of Poland and Ivan the Ter
rible. It was our own Great Leo XIII
who adjusted the quarrel between
Hayti and San Domingo. Whilo as
late as 1S85, when Bismark submitted
the German controversy with Spain
over the Caroline Islands to tho Vati
can, an agreement was formulated
which established peace and prevent-j
! war. Aye. but yesterday, our Holy !
Father Pope Benedict XV, was select
ed as arbitrator of the diliiculty exist
ing between Peru and Bolivia. !
It 'is most significant that ' those
powers, who have so long ignored
Rome, are sending envoys to her
Court, and who shall ray that if Eng
land, Russia, France, Turkey, Ger
many and all tho other nations now
engaged in war, had, before the war,
sent their envoys to tho Vatican, that
the great; European slaughter now go
ing on might not have been averted?
Even though Rome by the rebellion of
once loyal nations Is limited in the
exercise of her Divino power, yet she
has done moreHhan all the other pow
ers put together to bring relief to
thoso thousands of wounded soldiers
of all creeds and no creed, who were
languishing in foreign lauds. It is
the good offices of our Holy Father
that are bringing back the wounded
soldiers to the firesides in their na
tive lands which they love and long
for. Let us hope and pray that the
day is not far distant when Rome
Fhall again be recognized as tho great
Papal Court of Arbitration and so
avert in the future the awful slaught
er that the world is a witness of to
day. Aye! it is Rome alone that will
ever bring about the understanding
necessary to an enduring peaco of na
tions. For the Brotherhood of Man
divorced from the Fatherhood of God
is a mere mock.
What a rebuke this war of many
nations is to the pride and conceit
which set up the Hague as a surveyor
of international peace! It is Hamlet
with Hamlet left out. There it stands,
a magnificent building the Peace
Palace at the Hague to mock its
founders. The money did not come

10 KEEP FAITH,
SAYS THORNt
Charge Mads by Iowa Railroad
Commissioner
APPEARED FOR SHIPPERS
But His Opening Argument Turned
Scales Against Feople In Favor
of Corporations.
Washington, Feb. 10. Investigation
of President .Wilson's, nomination of
Louis D. Branileis of Boston to the
supreme court bench was begun yes
terday by a Senate subcommittee
which first heard Clifford Thome,
of the Iowa board of railroad coin
misssioners, who. was associated with
Mr. Brandeis in the light against giv
ing tho eastern railways increased
freight rates. Air. Thome assailed
the conduct of Air. BrandeJs ia that
case. .
'! believe the nominee before this
committee was guilty of infidelity, of
breach of faith and of unprofessional
conduct in connection with one of the
greatest cases of this generation,"
said he. Thorne charged that Brand
eis, as a lawyer appearing for the
shippeis, conceded that the rate re
turn to tho railways was indequate
and that Brandeis in his opening oral
argument to the interstate commerce
commission conceded that "the re
turns were inconsistent with prosper
ity of the railways and welfare of the
public." "I was simply duinfounded,"
declared Thorne. v
the poor, no, the money was rolled
up mountain high by manipulating the
tariff schedules and by grinding the
face of the poor. The Peace Palace
Is novv silent. It was so filled with
emptiness that there was no room
for the Vicar of Christ. It meditated
vain things and verily It received its
reward. Its reward was not peace
but the plaudits of those who deny
tho authority of the Pope of Rome,
of those w'ho would dethrone Relig
ion in favor of science not knowing
that Theology Is the highest, in
tellectual science of them all.
The very idea of the Hague came
from the Church. It was a French
Catholic Alonk Emeric Cruce, who
some three hundred years ago wrote
out a concrete plan for a world Court
of Arbitration. It was from tho book
cf this monk The New Cynea3 that
Hugo Grotius, Gustavus Adolphus, our
own Charles Sumner and many other
leading advocates of international ar
bitration are said to have received
their inspiration which afterwards
niateralized in the Hague.
In his plan, the holy monk gave
first place to the Roman Pontiff, but
at the Hague, they would not have it
so. Shall we wonder then, that this
cold temple stands stark, warning the
world that Christ is the center of
peace and that a rejection of His
Vicar Is a rejection of Christ Him
self? , i
Oh! It is as simple as can bo; if we
want peaco in our hearts, peace In our
homes, peace In our industries, nnd
peaco in our governments, wo must
pay the price. The price of peace Is,
the obedience to the law of Christ.
"When Tho Lord is my Shepherd. I
have no want."
It was but yesteryear that the
world saw an example of national
peace established in the name of our
Lord. Argentina and Chilo had long
quarrelled over their boundary line,
when at length the eloquent protest
of the Bishop of. Argentina, brought
these two southern republics from the
state of war to a stale of peace. They
finally bent to the call cf Christ and
entered into an agreement to end
their conflicts. They melted their
cannon to cast a colossal statute of
our Lord, the Prince of Peace. In the
heart of the Andes, on tho mountain
pass between Argentine and Chile,
tho Christ of the Andes now stands
with a cross in His left hand and Hl3
righ hand raised to bless the compact
between our southern neighbors. At
the base of the monument there is in
scribed this, their mutual pledge:
"Sooner shall these mountains
crumble into dust, than Argentines
and Chileans break the peace which
at the feet of Christ tho Bedeemer
they have sworn to maintain."
We may cry "pence! peace! !" but
there shall be war until in our hearts
we erect the image of Christ until in
our domestic life, in our industrial
life and in our governmental affairs,
wo rule ourselves, our homes, our
business, and our nation by the prin
ciples of peace.
