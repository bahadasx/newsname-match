MILITARY OPERATIONS IN

ACTIVITY ON THE EAST AND WEST FRONTS
Germans, with Partial Success,
are Hammering Away on
the French Lines
(By Ataociated Press.)
LONDON, Feb. 10. Signs that military operations of impor-
tance may be impending In the Balkans are furnished by the Bui-
garian government organ at Sofia, which asserts the rights of Bui-
garia to invade Greece for an attack on the French and British
there. Hecent reports regarding the intentions of the Teutons as
to the move on Saloniki have been contradictory. On both the
western and eastern fronts activity during the last few days has
been marked. A movement of Importance may be developing at
the northern end of the Russian line where the artillery play is re-
ported heavy. In the west initiative appears to be with the Ger-
mans, who are hammering on the French lines, making occasional
gains at some points, with succe ;ses for the French at other points.
Berlin has announced the capture of a large trench section north-
west of Vlmy. The Germans admit a reverse near Becquincourt.

QUESTION OF MILITARY PREPAR
EDNESS WILL BE UNDER
CONSIDERATION
NEW YORK. Feb. 10. When the
112th meeting of American Institute
of Mining Engineers convenes here
next Monday (Feb. 14) It Is expected
that In addition to discussing que
Hons of vital Importance to mining
rlrcles of the country the engineers
will have before them the whole ques
tlon of military preparedness. Gen
eral Leonard Wood will address one
of the first meetings on behalf of a
reserve corps of engineers to serve
In time of emergency; Secretary
Daniels will co-operate by sending
the engineers around New York har-
bor on a naval vessel; and a letter
has Just been reeelvea rroni President
Wilson calling upon the engineers to
aid In "organizing the manufacturing
resources of the, country for a case
of emergency."
It is expected that the next week's
meeting of the mining engineers will
be as vital, from the standpoint of
construction work, as any that has
yet been held. Some of the addresses
which are expected to excite a na
tionwide discussion among mining
engineers are notes on flotation by J.
M. Callow; substitutes for platinum,
by F. A. Fahrenwald; and metalogra
phy for steel for U. 8. naval ordinance,
by H. E. Cook.
There are at present Home 8,500
members of the Mining Engineers In
stitute and It la expected that a large
number of these will be In atten
dance. A noteworthy feature this
year will be the elaborate entertain
ment of the families of the members
and a general program of festivity
which will be held between the hours
of the business meetings. These fes

"You may also slate that we have
taken an option on the potash-alum
property north of Blair until May 1
and we will at once expend several

BERLIN,' Feb. 10. It is not gener

Inconsiderable pearl industry, and in
the last 100 years many thousands of
the gems have been fished up out of
the waters of the various German
rivers.
Bavaria has' been the most produc

of 155,880 pearls. It is estimated, were
found there between 1814 and 1857,
and the annual aggregate has only
decreased as the waters of Bavarian
rivers have been spoiled by various
industrial projects.
The most productive river has al-,
ways been the Elster In Saxony,
which for centuries Has been rented
to one family by the state. The year
In, year-out average has shown that
from three to four pearls can be ob

up, and that one out of every 18 pearls
Is of special value.
