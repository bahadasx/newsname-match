SEVERAL CON L* ^TS
H, D. Henion, Formerly With C.
Jewett Co., Organizes Local
Company.
$48,000 IN CONTRACTS
ARE ALREADY SECURED
Company on Working Basis Will
Build Several Large
Plants.
Henion, formerly a machinist
with the C. W. Jewett Automobile
company, after seven years of per
severance and "watchful waiting"
has perfected a concrete post mould,
obtained a patent and signed a'con
tract in six different states for moulds
which will bring him $48,000.
Began Seven Years Ago.
Seven years ago, the field opened by
the need of concrete fence posts, at
tracted his attention. He began to
figure on a practical post and the re
quirements Five years ago his
work was rewarded by the invention
of what he determined was the most
practical and easiest made concrete
post
Secures Canadian Patent.
After a few months of financial
hardships and saving, he secured
enough money to secure a patent. He
has held this patent since and in ad
dition secured one from the Dominion
of Canada
Having completed his duties at the
Jewett Automobile company some
time ago, he spent his spare moments
in attempting to get a start for his
post mould manufacturing concern
A company was formed with A
Barker, president, W Brooks,
treasurer and Mr Henion, secretary
manager
Goes to Twin Cities.
About a week ago, in the interests
of the company, Mr. Henion went to
the Twin Cities He there found a
railroad which endorsed his post and
mould and signed a contract for $8,-
000 for use of the post and mould in
Minnesota Other companies hav
ing heard of the post, soon came to
him and he is now the possessor of
contracts aggregating $48,000 for use
of the posts and moulds in six states
The company, which is known as
the Bemidji Concrete Post Mould
company, has been put on a working
basis and will in all probability be
composed of several large plants and
buildings The present intention is
to erect structures and place machin
ery in operation that will cost sev
eral thousand dollars No site has
been chosen or any definite steps
taken.
Made of Solid Concrete.
The post produced from the patent
mould will be the height of any or
dinary fence post. It is made of
solid concrete, reinforced with barbed
wire or steel The post itself is
square and tapers from the ground
line to a point at the bottom and al
most to a point above the surface
line.
One feature of the post, by which
many others have proven themselves
not practical is the unique and sim
ple way of fastening the wire. Three
slots are cut through the post, on
the wire surface of which are small
indentions. The wire passes over
the indentions, and is secured to the
post by a hooked wire which JS
wedged in place on the back side of
the post by a hard wood or steel
wedge

Pointed Out Pasturage of Lands Will
Prevent Growth of Young
Timber.
URGED THAT LANDS BE
DEVELOPED FOR AGRIGULTURE
Strong resolutions opposing the
Nelson bill, which provides for the
establishment of a forest reserve
within the Red Lake reservation, will
be presented to a joint meeting of the
Merchants and Commercial club this
afternoon by the committee on reso
lutions appointed at a recent meeting
of the clubs It is believed that the
resolutions will be immediately
adopted
Copies to Senators.
Copies of the resolution, if adopted,
wall be sent to every United States
Senator
It is urged in the resolution that
the land now within the reservation
be so managed so as to hasten the
day when the land may be used in
an intense way for agriculture, graz
ing and pasturage purposes.
The resolution committee of the
joint associations is composed of At
torney E E McDonald, E Denu
and J. Opsahl.
Will Prevent Agriculture.
The resolution is as follows:
Resolved, that the Bemidji Com
mercial club and the Merchants Asso
ciation of Bemidji, acting in joint
session, do resolve that they are op
posed to the passage of Senate File
1E23, introduced in the Senate of the
United States, December 10, 1915, by
Senator Nelson, being a bill "To pro
vide for the establishment of a for
est reserve within Red Lake Indian
Reservation, Minnesota," and for the
following reasons:
That the bill proposes to establish
upon the territory described therein,
consisting of over one hundred sev
enty-seven sections, a forest preserve
or reservation and that the establish
ment and maintenance of a forest
preserve administered as the bill pro
vides in accordance with the princi
ples of scientific forestry with a view
to the production of successive tim
ber growths thereon, will prevent the
use of this land for the purpose of
pasturage or agriculture.
The land cannot be pastured ex
cept in large areas and a successful
use of this land for pasturage pur
poses will prevent reforestration.
Must Be Pastured Intensely.
That to pasture land successfully
it must be pastured intensely and to
pasture land intensely by the use of
sheep, goats or cattle, will prevent the
growth of young timber and refor
estration, to accomplish which is the
main purpose of this bill.
For the reason that we believe the
establishment of a great forest re
serve upon these particular lands of
the Indians would prevent their
progress along the lines of husbandry,
and prevent developing these lands on
the south shore of the lake and on
the point for agricultural purposes.
The soil is such and the protection
from frost by reason of the presence
of a large body of water that vege
tables, corn, grain and fruits may be
raised without danger from early
frosts.
The interest of the Indians as well
as those owning lands in the vicinity
of this proposed forest reservation
would be best served by encouraging
the development of this land for ag
ricultural and grazing purposes by
the Indians or the white people as
indicated.
To Hasten Agriculture.
And we demand that this territory
proposed to be set apart in a forest
reserve, as well as the other three
hundred thousand acres of land now
within the Indian reservation of Red
Lake be so managed as to hasten the
day when that land may be used in
a most intense way for agriculture,
grazing and pasturage purposes. We
represent that there are not more than
10 sections within the 100,000 acres
proposed to be set apart in this for
est reserve, that is better known for
.purposes of reforestration than for
agricultural purposes, that the his
tory of the administration of forests
is such as to preclude the idea of
the Indians receiving any net income
from the administration of this area
under a national forestry system for
years to come.
