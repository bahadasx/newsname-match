SENATOR ROBERT M,
LAFOLLETTE.
Senator LaFoIlette of Wisconsin
needs no introduction as he is ono
of the beat known senators in the
country owing to his prominent
aggressiveness in matters of Iegis
lation, and also because of his can
didacy for the republican presi
dential nomination. He is a good
fighter in politics, and in legisla
tion also whenever he starts out,
and he does not do this unless he
feels he is in the right. He has
scores of admirers throughout the
country, and in the course of
events it is possible that he may
become president of the United
States some day.
SEN. ROBT. M. LA FOLLETTE
Senator LaFoIlette was born at
Primrose, Dane County, Wiscon
sin, June 14, 1855, and he is there
fore past sixty years of age, but
in appearance he is a remarkably
well preserved man. He is a
graduate of the University of
Wisconsin, and by profession a
lawyer. Within two years after
he graduated, and when he was
twenty-five years of age, he was
elected county attorney of Dane
County, and re-elected 1882
two years later he was elected a
member of Congress, and re-elect
ed in 1886 and 1888, but defeated
in 1890. In 1900 he was elected
governor of Wisconsin re-elected
in 1902, and again in 1904.
In 1905 Senator LaFoIlette was
elected to the United States Sen
ate, and took his seat on January
4, 1906. He was re-elected to the
Senate in 1911. and his term will,
therefore, expire March 3, 1917.
Leech Lake Pillagers
May Sue.
A bill has been introduced in
Congress which will give the Pil
lager Chippewas the right to sue,
in the Court of Claims, the United
States for its failure to keep the
treaty with those Indians mide in
1847.
Under th* treaty of 1847 the
Leech Lake Pillagers ceded to the
United States approximately 700,-
000 acres of iand in Todd and
Morrison counties, in order to
have placed there the Menominee
Indians to form a birrier between
the then warring Chippewa and
Sioux tribes of Indians.
pt
The war having been in pro
gress for more than a century, the
government proposed placing the
Menominee Indians, who were
friendly to both tribes, at a portion
of the state where the Indian bat
tles frequently took place, and to
this the Pillager Chippewa? gave
their assent under the condition
tivit the lands ceded by the treaty
of 1847 would continue to be In
dian lands. For this cession the
Pillagers received fifteen thousand
dollars.
Instead of placing the Menom
inee Indians upon the lands ceded
for the purpose indicated, the
United States paid the latter about
two hundred thousand dollars to
not come there, and subsequently
the Jando were opened to settle
ment without further compensa
tion to the Pillagers, and now the
latter are demanding proper com
pensation for their rights of occu
pancy to the land on the grounds
that the government had failed to
fill its agreement with them.
The attorneys for the Indians
are Thos. F. Wallace of Minne
apolis, and Edward L. Rogers of
Walker.
Removal Of Daniels.
The removal of C. C. Daniels
from the position of prosecutor-in
chiof of the land suits of this res
ervation will no doubt receive the
approval of the progressive In
dians of this reservation, because
he has, like M. C. Burcb, Tcm
Harper~and~8upt. -Howard,-been- a
disturbing element among the al
lottees of this reservation since he
was assigned to Chippewa land
matters.
Mr. Daniels had hardly got the
official seat to which he was as
signed warm when he commenced
to interfere in tribal affairs of the
Chippewas, which were outride of
his duties as land prosecutor, and
in taking sides with one faction
upon this reservation as against
the other.
Mr. Kearful, successor of Mr.
Daniels, has the reputation at
Washington of beir.g not only a
good lawyer but also of being a
fair man, and he will undoubtedly
be satisfactory to all the Indians
as well as the whites concerned in
the White Earth land suits.
Blackfeet Indians
In Trouble.
Still
Notwithstanding the fact that
A. E. McFatridge was removed
from the position of superintend
ent of the Blackfeet Agency a
couple of years ago, be still re
mains upon the Blackfeet reserva
tion in Montana, a thorn in the
sides of the Blackfeet Indians.
After his removal from the In
dian service McFatridge remained
at the agency and started a news
paper, where, the Blackfeet In
dians charge, he is the controlling
factor of the affairs of their agency
and for this reason they want the
Indian office to order him away
from the reservation.
The Blackfeet Indians also have
a claim against the United States
which they want referred to the
Court of Claims for adjudication,
Tnis claim is for land, and Robt.
Hamilton, Curly Bear, Bird Rat
tler, Wolf Plume and Oliver Sand
erville have been sent to Washing
ton from the Blackfeet reservation
to urge the passage of a bill by
Congress giving the Court of
Claims jurisdiction to try the
claim.
THE TOMAHAWK
The Right Has Prevailed.
'Truth before Favor."
Although the administration has
been somewhat tardy in its dis
position of the attacks made upon
the rights of eighty-six members
of the White Earth bands by M.
C. Burch assisted by a few ignor
ant warehousers and one mixed
blood employe, the question at
issue was finally settled last week
by a decision of lhe Secretary of
the Interior.
No one who is familiar with the
attacks made upon the rights of
certain members of thi reserva
tion believed that the final result
would He otherwise than it was,
and all know the motives which
were back of these attacks.
The plain and uncontrovertible
truth regarding the enrollment
cases was that M. C. Burch had
only one purpose in view when he
initiated the attack upon the
rights of the respondents, and this
was to try and subjugate B. L.
Fairbanks and the publisher of
THE TOMAHAWK, and to thus try
and prevent them, through THE
TOMAHAWK, from exposing furth
er his despicable and questionable
methods of prosecuting the land
suits of this reservation for the
purpose of prolonging his em
ployment, which Daniels could not
straighten out but which no doubt
the latter's successor will be able
to do, because he has the reputa
tion of being not only a good law
yer but a fair man, and he will
rely only upon the merits of the
suits to settle them,,* ***&&$&
After Burch's ignomindus fail
ure to sustain a frivolous charge
before the United States court at
Fergus Falls against B. L. Fair
banks and the publisher of THE
TOMAHAWK and other members of
this reservation, he immediately
attacked their rights as members
of the Minnesota Chippewa bands,
and charged that they belonged to
the Wisconsin bands. In this con
tention he induced, with the aid of
Special Agent Shearman, who was
sent to this reservation by the
Secretary of the Interior to in
vestigate the matter, twelve or
fifteen persons, principally ware
housers, to sign a petition for the
"Purification of the Chippewa
Roll" and several of these per
sons repudiated the petition upon
the grounds that it was misrepre
sented when read to them, at the
hearings before Mr. Shearman.
It is hard to say now which was
the worst, M. C. Burch, the petti
fogging lawyer, or Thos. Shear
man, the hypocrite.
If there had been any desire on
the part of Burch to really purify
the Chippewa rolls he would not
have confined himself to two mem
bers of the Beaulieu and Fair
banks families, but would have in
cluded all of the members of these
families even those who remained
neutral in the disputes upon this
reservation and many others whose
parents had drawn script and
vhich was the alleged basis of his
attack upon the respondents. In
stead of doing this, he actually
got F. Duane Porter, who was
himself a scripee according to the
records of the script book, to sign
the peitio against the Beaulieu
and Fairbanks families, and whose
rights outside of being a scripee
could be questioned according to
the decision of the United States
Circuit Court in the Oakes et al.
case.
Burch had other motives be
sides those mentioned for attack
ing the respondents, and these
were to intimidate near full bloods
from declaring at the trials 6f the
land suits that they are mixed
bloods for fear of being put off

the rolls, and also to play upon
the cupidity of the full-bloods who
believed that if a large number of
mixed bloods were stricken from
the rolls the annuity payments
would be increased accordingly
also that if this belief could be
kept up he coulckin this way in
duce Indian witnesses to testify to
anything he might suggest to
them.
Thos. Shearman was sent
here as a special representative of
the Interior Department, and he
violated his instructions by calling
upon the tools of Burch and his
gang and inducing them to sign a
petition.
While the enrollment cases were
pending in the Courr of Claims
this mau Shearman made a report
with the view no doubt of preju
dicing the court, but it had no
effect as against the respondents
as it was intended.
Mr. Daniels, whose sympathies
caused him to be led into innumer
ous errors, kept up the Burch tac
tics after his initiation by Harper,
who was dismissed from the ser
vice for a violation of the United
States statutes, but as the former
has also been transferred it is
quite probable that more than a
dozen suits will be tried during
the next six or seven years. At
least some reliance should be
placed upon the intentions of the
Department of Justice to rely
hereafter simpb upon the merits
of each case now pending before
the master in chancery.
Furthermore, since the respond
ents have been reinstated io their
rights and which they have held
since their births, some more than
seventy years ago, there is a gen-1
eral belief that the factional fight
which was created between the
mixed-bloods and some full-bloods
on one side, and a few full bloods
on the other, will now subside.
Assistant Commissioner of In
dian Affairs Merritt, and Judge
Pollock of the Interior Depart
ment, are quoted by the members
of the Chippewa delegation that
went to Washington last year as
saying that the suspension of the
respondents in the enrollment
cases was ill advised, and that they
felt that the law would not sustain
the action. The decision of the
Secretary of the Interior in favor
of the respondents has justified
this belief.
Congressman Miller Stands
By Chippewas.
HAKES HARD FI8HT TO REDUCE
APPROPRIATIONS.
Congressman Miller, last week
when the Indian appropriation
bill was before the House, made a
hard fight against the appropria
tion af $185,000 from the tribal
funds of the Chippewas of Minne
sota, and offered an amendment to
reduce the amount to $100,000.
He stated to the House that the
Chippewas were opposed to the
large appropriations which were
being made annually from their
tribal funds to be squandered by
the Indian office, and gave some
illustrations of the manner in which
these funds have been squandered.
Congressman Ellsworth, the
new member from this state, who
is on the Indian commi tee, op
posed Mr. Miller in favor of the

appropriation.
Both Congressmen Miller and
Ellsworth supported the amend
ment to the Indian bill which pro
vides that the Chippewas shall bo
paid one-fourth of the amount now
in the Treasury of the United
States to their credit, and this pro
vision was passed, so that if )t is
kept in the bill in the senate, a big
paymeut may be looked for here
by those who are competent to
handle their own affairs, and :t is
hoped this payment will be made
during the coming summer.
Congressman Miller also opposed
the appropriation of $10,000 from
Chippewa tribal funds to pay ex
perts of the Geological Survey to
examine the unsold lands of the
Chippewas of Minnesota and learn
if they contained mineral deposit*.
This was done at the request of
the Chippewa delegates now at
Washington, but Mr. Miller's op
position was voted down. His
desire was not to exppnd Chippe
wa funds foe ihe examination of
the lands, f.jr, as he stated, the
only sure test of the presence of
iron on the lands was to drill
them, and that the bill should
simply reserve the mineral rights
for the benefit of the Chippewas
that the amount of *10,000 was
insufficient for any benefit to the
Indians.
