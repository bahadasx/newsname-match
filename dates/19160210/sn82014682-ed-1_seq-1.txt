Yee Ya Keuk, Now in Prison for
20 Years, Will Come Before
" Grand Jury Next Week
CLAIM HE SHOT ENEMY
AFTER BREAKING WINDOW
Had Made Threats to Kill, and
Had Cuts on His Right Hand
When Taken After Duel
Yee : Yo Kenkr , Korean desierado,
who now Is serving a prison sentence
of not less than, five or more than 20
years"-for first degree robbery," may
shortly be called into Circuit . Judge
Ashford's court to answer a charge of
first degree murder.
As a result of investigations wMch
have been in progross since Yee Yo
Keuk was captured at daybreak on De
cember 9 after a running gun fight
with police and detectives, the city
and county attorney's office believes
it now has sufficient evidence to war
rant an indictment, by the territorial
grand jury charging the Korean with
first degree murder. City Attorney A:
M. Brown said today.1 This evidence
has been slowly gathered, bit ' by bit,
by detectives, pollceand officials in
the attorney's office.-
The evidence tends to link np Yee
Yo Keuk with the murder of Chee
Wong Yer,' a Korean, who was r rent
collector for Ev C. Winston, who-was
found dead In his room in a tene
ment on the morning that Yee was
captured, r ":f ,
Window Glass Broken, v
The Korean had been shot. A jag
ged hole in the window gave evidence
that the man who hid done the killing
had thrust both. Hand and : revolver
through the glass and fired. - When
captured, ; Yee . Yo Kenk's right, hand
was found to be cut in several places.
Other evidence is that,: on one occa
e ion Yee bad threatened to kill CJjee
JrWoBgJfcae -on-ihe, gen ihather lafr
ter naa "tipped oH the police as to
the 1 desperado's - whereabouts.; The
district attorney's' . office claims to
have other evidence linking Yee Yo
Keuk with the crime.
. f'ltv iftnrtir Hrnwn utatati . nnn.
clusiveV today that he. will "present
the case to the grand jury. A meet
ing of the tribunal will be held at 2
o'clock tomorrow afternoon, but It is
not likely that the matter will be pre
sented at that time. . It will probably
be submitted to the jury a week from
tomorrow, Mr. Brown says..
The penalty for first degree murder
is death, the court having no alterna
tlve. A prison sentence cannot be
inflicted, as In convictions - of second
degree murder or manslaughter.
"Kallhi channel appropriation will
go through this year, if any new har
bor projects are passed by Congress,
and I believe there will be," declared
Charles R. Forbes, chairman of ,the
Harbor Board, this morning. 1 -
"The -amount required for the work.
$683,000, Is not much as Congression
al appropriations go, and the impor
tance of additional harbor room for
Honolulu has been passed upon fav
orably by the rivers and . harbors
board. The approval of the chief of en
gineers and the secretary of war is a
matter of routine, and the House com
mittee : on rivers and harbors . are
thoroughly Informed as to the sftua-
tion here. I don't see how. there can
be' any hitch in the program.
The area to be thrown open to ship
ping by dredging under the plan now
proposed will be about 40 acres, or
almost half of the. present area of the
harbor. The length of the new chan
nel will be about-4 300 feet, of which
1000 feet ia to be done under the. first
appropriation. Mr. Forbes, who ap
peared In several hearings on the mat;
ter, believes that appropriations will
be made every year for the project un
til it Is completed, at an estimated
cost of 11,779.000.
If ' the appropriation act is passed
by this : Congress ; work will probably
be started this . year and will take
from 18 months to two years for com
pletion. :
