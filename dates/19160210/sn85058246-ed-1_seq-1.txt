V REASONS FOR
i LEAVING U. A. G.
I Dr. John A. Wldtsoo took up the
I entire time nt chapel yesterday morn-
1ng at the U. A. C. explaining hts
H TCasons fop leaving the college and
I accepting the presidency of the Unl-
I verslty of Utah.
H "Yesterday morning," said Dr.
H Wldtsoo amid breathless silence of
H the student body and faculty, "the
H train bound for Salt Lake carried
H two letters signed by. myself." Here
H tho president paused as it It wero
H -with great effort to continue "One
H -went to tho Board of Regents tell-
H lng them that I would accept their
H offer of the presidency of tho Unl-
H verslty of Utah; and tho other one
m -went to the faculty of the Unlvers-
H lty stating that I would bo in Salt
HJ Lake at the beginning of tho next
Hj school term to preside over that in-
HJ stitutlon. Now you want to know
H why I did it, and I will proceed to
H explain. First, let me say that I
HJ understand conditions perfectly I
H know that I am leaving a peaceful,
H quiet and progressiva Institution and
H am entering ono which Is not so
H peaceful. Thero is llttlo doubt in
(H my mind that my own ambitions
W could bo mora realized hero than nt
H tho University. I know that I nm
H leaving the particular line of work
H to which I havo given the greater
H part of ray llfo, and I am going Into
H ono with which I am not so well ac-
jH qualnted. In splto of this fact. I can
H Bay wUu assurance, that ft is better
Hj for tho peoplo of Utah, it is better
H for tho (duso of education In tho
H State of Utah, that I take up my new
t position. Aro you awaro that when
HJ the Board of Regents decided that
H they wanted a new executlvo, that
DL there was no other man in tho State
UJ of Utah on whom, they could agree?
(J Tho names of other men in the stato
HJ came up repeatedly, hut with the
M same result of dlsscntlon among tho
H Hoard. Different men from tho cast-
H ern colleges and universities wero
H suggested and soon I becamo an aro
H of the fact that I was the only man
H in tho wliolo state of Utah who, un-
H der tho conditions might bo tho
H president of tho University.
H Now, what was my duty to my
H state, which I love, and tho causo for
H which I havo given tho greater Part
H of my life? To remain hero, as
some have suggested, and persuo my
H course, or to rescue our sister lnatl
H tutlon from the hands of somo east
H cm man who is not in tho least ac
H qualnted with our own conditions? It
H would be one of tho worst things that
H could happen to tho University to
H havo such a man. He wou'.d coma
hero with tho ideals of an eastorn
collego which might not only fall to
H find consistent application to our
H University, but might provo dlsas-
trous in various ways to oir sictoj
Institution and to education in our
beloved stato. Ho would bo utterly
H unacquainted with our conditions, our
H Ideals, our system of education and
H our traditions. Being a graduate from
H ono of tho largo eastern universities
H T know whereof I Bpeak. 'I uni'or
H stand tho difference in eastern and
H western schools, I understand thor-
, H oughly .tho conditions in tho Stato of
! Utah, There is not a man on this
, faculty or in this student body who
H is better acquainted with this stato;
,.' H and moro especially education in
H this stato, than myself. Consequent-
ly after considering tho question
H carefully I feel it my duty to niy
1 H state and tho causo for which I stand
to accept the new position
H Now there havo been in clrcuia-
tlon numerous ideas, as to what will
be the fato of tho Utah Agricultural
Collego. Some havo predicted with
. (.reat certainty an lmmcdlato consol-
idntlon of tho two schools. They
AJP bavo said that the greater part of
V this school will be taken from oro
to tho University to mako It a big-
ser and better institution and to grat-
ify the ambitlo'nB of it? now pros!-
dent. Let mo tell you that nothing
cau ho farther from tho truth. Noth-
ing can bo a greater fallacy. Lot mo
ask tho8o who havo made such as-
ertlons what can bo their concep-
tlons of mo? What do they imaglno
aro tho feelings of my hoart after
twenty-ilvo years of working, "of
building, of striving for this instltu
H tlon upon leaving H7 I haye been
with this schoq In its infancy and
la its maturity. I havo seen tho
building of overy new addition since
tho main building was constructed.
I know It absolutely from top to bot
tom, every nook and corner, and I
tell you from the bottom of my heart
that I lovo It. Who can think of my
working against it or trying to hin
der its progress? That I will never
do, and it always holds tho same
high placo In my estimation as ono
of the most practical and service
able institutions In tho Stato of
Utah. I shall always realize tho ex
cellent work that this institution and
other agricultural colleges In the
!ald are doing and instead of try
ing to dissolve it, I .shall try to help
It, to help tho man who presides ov
er it whoever bo may bo, and to
bring It nearer to 'our sister .institu
tion in tho great causo qf education.
My successor may do greater and
broader 'work than myself. Ho may
bo tho particular man tho Institution
needs. Thero aro many excellent
men for tho position, nnd I feel tho
chango is not harmful to this Institu
tion. I tako up my new position only
on conditions that I contlnuo in tho
sarao Ideas and systems of education
for which 1 have stood. Instead of'
working upon tho affair as harmful
to our Institution and to education,
let us unite In good will to advance
and upbuild our school and' to make
education In this stato superior to
tho education In any other stato in,
this union." yr
