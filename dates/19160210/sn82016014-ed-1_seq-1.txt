The fighting is proceeding with
Breat fierceness in a heavy snow
storm, according to latest dispatches
rr-nm Paris. The French are counter
attacking with great vigor near the t
Neuville-La Falie road, where the Ger- j
mans claimed capture of half a mile j
of French trenches in Tuesday night's
fighting. Their objective is the Vlmy
heights overlooking tne plains sweep- j
ing down todawrd the cities or xoos
and Doual held by the Germans.
At Close Range.
Artillerymen on both sides are ex
tremely active. French gunners have
poured a blasting fire in upon the vil
lage of Vimy, pounding to ruins the
few buildings which withstood pre
vious bombardments. By means of
mining operations and attacks with
hand grenades, the Teutons are seek
ing to improve their position at this
point and hand to hand fighting has
resulted.
Despite persistent reports from
Dutch sources, military critics here do
not generally credit the rumors that
the Germans are about to deliver a
hard smash against the allied lines.
While fresh bodies of troops have ar
rived at the German front in Flanders,
other forces have been withdrawn in
the past few days. j
The opinion prevails here that the
Germans are merely engaged in one
of the periodical "reshifting" proc
esses. 6 LINERSMISSING

A London dispatch today said that
Lloyds has posted the following six
liners as missing:

late in December. No word has been
heard from any of them excepting
the Spanish steamer, which wirelessed
on December 27 that she was sinking
off the Scilly islands.
Since the Orissa has docked, ship
ping circles are wondering what Brit
ish steamer is the victim of the re
ported "serious accident" in midocean.

Hamilton, Bermuda, Feb. 10.
Nothing is known here of tho reported
capture of the German cruiser Roon

Washington, Feb. 10. Secretary
Lansing announced today that he had

ment through Ambassador Fenfield a
dispatch asking for an investigation
and an explanation of the attack by an
Austrian submarine on the American
near Alexandria by an Austrian sub
marine which fired upon her and
wounded -one man in her engine room.
The submarine commander asked for
food which Captain Thompson of the
Petrolite refused. He thereupon sent
a boarding party on the Amei lean ship

npr crew whe was held as hostage
while the AuEtrians took what food
thev required from the Petrolite's
stores.
Involves Novel Questions.
Novel questions are involved in the
case. Warships under certain stress
may take food, from merchantmen if
they give proper receipts or payment,
but it is realized that If submarines
are to be permitted to do so. every
neutral jhip might be made a base fur
their operations.
Renews E- Investigation.
Washington, Feb. 10. Investigation
of the explosion which wrecked the
submarine K-2 in the New York navy
yard recently killing four men and ser
iously injuring nine, was today or
dered resumed. Secretary Daniels said
the condition of Electrician Miles, one
of the injured men had improved suf
ficiently to permit the investigation to
continue. It had been postponed so
that the court might secure Miles'
testimony.

walking into the patch of woods where
her body was found today.
EYES 0N GUARD
Discipline Tightening Around
Kansas Citizen-Soldiers.
Code Authorizes Fine for Ab
sentees From Drill.
Comment has been made recently
upon the increased tendency toward
tightening of discipline in the Kansas
national guard, it is said. Throughout
the state, company, battalion and regi
mental commanders are making every
effort to induce guardsmen to attend
drill regularly. In a few instances un
excused absentees have been brought
in by a squad detailed for the purpose.
The Kansas military code feives com
manders authority to fine such ab
sentees and, in event they are unable (
to pay. to compel them to work out
their fines at the rate of a dollar a
day. The guardsmen are given the
right to appeal to a general court
t martial appointed by the governor.
The nation has Us eyes on its sol
diers." C. I. Martin, adjutant general,
said today. "And congress has its
eyes on the national guard with a view
to determining whether or not to give
the department of war greater control
and place it on a pay basis or to or
ganize a continental army exclusively
under the federal control. Our men
must come up to the mark set by the
regular army as far as the limited time
in which they are engaged permits
Failing in this they are not wanted as
members of the Kansas national
q.uard."

Washington, Feb. 10. President
Wilson was told flatly today bv ' Re-

j mittee that they believed the commit
I tee was practically unanimously op-
posed to the continental army plan
i sponsored by the war department. "
J They said they believed the committee i

guard-and empowering the president to !
! draft it into the regular army in time j

The Republicans left the White
House with the impression that the
president still believed the continental
army plan the best so far devised. He
showed no disposition, they said, to at
tempt to force adoption of any particu
lar pian put expressed the conviction
that the committee would bring out a J
bill for an adequate army
Wilson Arprues a Point.
The president told them that while
he did not believe it feasible to substi
tute the national guard for the con
tinental army, he favored strengthen
ing the national guard. Under the
constitution the president contended
the guard is distinctly a state force.
The Kepublican contended that this
could be overcome by passing a law
allowing the president to draft tho
organization in time of war.
The president urged speed and was
told that the committee will begin
framing the army bill next week and
that it should be ready for the house
in three weeks or a month.
Representative Kahn, Republican,
said after seeing the president that
there was no disposition whatever on
either side to inject politics into the
bill. It was agreed, the president was
informed, that the regular army
should be Increased to approximately
tho strength suggested by the war de
partment. Outside of the continental
army feature, the congressmen said,
no important detail of the war de
partment plans was opposed by the
committee.
BANDIT JOBS 30
Lone Highwayman Goes Thru
U. P. Passenger Coach.
Wouldn't Rob Woman; Returns
Her Purse and $70.
Cheyenne, Feb. 10. Approximately
$100 In money was taken from 30
passengers by a banolt who last night
held up Union Pacific train No. 18
near Rock Springs. A purse contain
ing $70 was returned to a woman pas
senger, the bandit remarking he did
not want to rob a woman.
A posse headed by Sheriff McCourt ,
and Union Pacific agents is searching
the country for trace of the robber.
The bandit is supposed to have
boarded the train at Greenriver. The ;
first intimation of his oresence was
said to have been when, pointing two
pistols at a brakeman on the sleening
car, he compelled him to pass a hat
in which the passengers were made
to deposit money and other valuables.
According to trainmen several shots
were fired to intimidate the passen
gers.
Acted Quickly.
According to the account given by
trainmen the robber first appeared in
the observation car, intimated the only
passenger :n view, a woman, and
forced tne brakeman to orecede him
into the buffet compartment. Here
several men were ordered to throw
up their hands. Money and valuables
were collected quickly.
James Fitzgerald, conductor of the
sleeping car, was robbed by the
bandit, but ran through the train un
til he encountered the head brakeman
who signaled for the brakes and the
train slowed down. The bandit leaped
and escaped.

Declares low an Knew Bran

Washington, Feb. 1 0. James W.
Carmalt, chief examiner of the inter
state commerce commission, before
the senate subcommittee investigating
the nomination of Louis T. Braldeis to
the supreme court bench, today chal
lenged the declaration of Clifford
Thome, chairman of the Iowa railroad
commission, that Mr. Brandels had
c6ncealed from him the attitude he
would take in arguing the eastern
freight rate case before the commis
sion. Yesterday Mr. Thorn p. who was as
sociated with Mr. Brandeis in the trial
of the rate case for shippers and the
commission, declared he" was "dumb
founded" when Brandeis. at the out
set of his closing argument, conceded
the contention of the railroads that
existing rate returns were inadequate
for the prosperity of the roads and the
best interest of the public.
Carmalt Testifies.
"There is one incident firmly fixed

garding a conversation which Mr.
Thorhe had with me on the second day
of the argument in tne rate case. Mr.
Thorne, I understand, stated that

if
Firemen Could Only Aid
Escape of Occupants."
Joseph Hanlon. chief of Topeka's ;
department, is ahsolutely opposed
to the expenditure of any money on
the present auditorium, cither for en- ,
largement or repairs, unless the build- :
ins is made a fireproof structure. The
chief so voiced himself this morning. :
! And he is backed up by several mem
! bers of the city commission and by the
j city engineer, A. R. Young.
That the present auditorium is one
of the worst fire hazards in Topeka.
that it is certain to burn to the ground
if a fire ever gets a s-tart on the in
terior and that it would be impossible ;
to fight such a fire effectively if the :
auditorium should be filled with pco-i--le.
are further statements made by
Chief Har.on.
Building permits are granted or
withheld by the fire chief and with
! the eolid backing of a city commission
it might be possible to refuse to issue
a permit for the kind of building that
is beine proposed. Chief Hanlon said j
today he didn't know anything about
that but that he would do everything ;
his power to prevent enlarging or ;
repairing tho present building without:
making it fireproof.
"Immediately after the meeting of
the State Teachers' association," said j
Chief Hanlon. "1 was asked to appear ;
before several men at the Commercial
club and state my opinions about the
auditorium matter. I said then just ;
what 1 am saying now; that it would
be foolhardy to spend a lot more ;
monev on the auditorium without fire- ,
proofing it- They appeared to agree
with me at the time.
Would Burn I.ike Tinder.
"Now, there appears to be a move-'
ment , on to enlarge the , present
building, without making any provision
for fire prevention. I am absolutely
opposed to it. That building would
burn like tinder if it took fire. Ex
cept the walls it is of wooden con
struction and the work supporting
the balconies is properly put together
to burn like kindling. There would
he no way to save the building if it
took fire while filled with people and
I obiect to spending money merely to
make it possible for more people to
get inside the danger zone." ;
Chief Hanlon then explained what i
would take place if a fire should j
break out when the building was filled )
to capacity.
"The firemen couldn't do a thing."
he said. "They would simply have to j
stand out in the street and wait for j
the crowd to get out. How would it j
be possible to get lines of hose into i
the door.s with thousands of people
stampeding out? In the meantime
think what would be happening in
side. The floors are wood, the
entire- balcony is wood and the in
terior would burn like a cracker-box.
It is all right to talk about emptying
that auditorium in five minutes after
a Bryan speech but that's different
from emptying it after some fool has
shouted fire or after smoke and flame
have appeared. There are plenty or
exits, but how about reaching the
exits?"
Scoffs at Asbestos.
It was pointed out that suggestions
had been made for fire prevention by
using asbestos between the floors, but
Chief Hanlon scoffed at the idea.
"Such an arrangement might delay
a fire a minute but it would he of no
practical benefit. I'm not an architect
and do not attempt to state exactly
what should be done. But all that in
terior woodwork should be torn out
and concrete and steel put in its place.
It is foolish to do anything else. If the
enlargement plans do not call for fire
proof construction, let the building
alone. Leave it as it is. It will en-
danger fewer people. If it was en-
Large a wun woou aiiu uncii as in
planned it would be only a matter of
three or four years until people would
be calling it unsafe again." '
Chief Hanlon turned around to his
desk and picked up a magazine put out
for fire departments. It contains all
the recent fires in public buildings.
He turned page after page and the ,
fires were almost invariably in build
ings of brick and wood.
"Practically every disastrous fire in
a public building is in a building con-
structed just as the auditorium is con- i
structed," said he. "Cities and states I
