APPROVES OF PROGRAM
Daniels Supports Adminis
tration in Speech Before
Business Men.
Washington. Feb. 10. Secretary
Daniels of the navy defended the ad
ministration naval increase program
md advocated the immediate building
of an adequate merchant marine in
t speech here today before a session
of the Chamber of Commerce ot the
United States devoted to discussion of
national preparedness.
"We can no longer live unto our
lelves," said Mr. Daniels. "On our
farms we grow more than the repub
lic can consume. We must feed much
of the world. We have the right also
to have a large share in clothing the
world and supply people in all climes
whatever is manufactured in our mills
and factories.
Is Pressing Problem.
"But how can we fill our larger mis
ion? What avails teeming harvests
and large production in factories with
out adequate and reasonable water
transportation? The securing of an
adequate merchant marine is a press
ing problem and it is so tied up with
tie enlarging and strengthening of our
navy that the two cannot be widely
separated.
"The naval program offered by the
iffiEoTsffation Is tr constructive, pro
gressive one, and if built according to
the continuous fle-year program the
Bret continuing program ever pro
posed by an administration it will give
qs by the year 1921, 33 capital ships
1 the first line and 25 battleships of
the second line, with 10 armored
cruisers, 10S destroyers, 175 subma
rines and smaller craft in propor
tion." Follower of Franklin.
Mr. Daniels declared himself to be
t disciple of Benjamin Franklin on
the question of preparedness. "This
philosopher and statesman declared
that there never was a good war nor
a bad peace,' but he did more to pre
pare for the impending revolution
than any other man," he said.
"Xo man In the revolutionary per
iod could be preferred before him in
preparedness for defense. His achieve
ments for preparedness may well be
itndied by the people of this genera
tion."

to a woman passenger, the bandit re-

held up and robbed 30 passengers in
a Pullman on an eastbound Union Pa-
Icific train last night between Green
j River and Rock Springs, Wyo., accord
ing to reports to railroad headquar
ters here today. The robber leaped
from the train when the alarm spread
to other cars. A posse has left Green
River in pursuit.
The robber first appeared in the ob
servation car, intimidated a woman
passenger and forced Brakeman Tay
lor to precede him into the buffet com-,
partment. Several men were ordered
to throw up their hands, and when one
was slow about complying, the bandit
fired two shots. Money and valuables
were collected quickly and the bandit,
following Taylor, proceeded into the
sleeping car ahead, where passengers
in their berths were robbed.
James Fitzgerald, conductor, was
covered by the bandit and robbed but
ran from the car as the latter glanced
into a berth. The robber fired as Fitz
gerald ran, but without effect. As the
train slowed down the bandit took
alarm and escaped.
BRANDEIS UPHELD
BY CALIFORNIA
Washington, Feb. 10. The senate
Judiciary sub-committee continued to
day its inquiry into the nomination of
Louis D. Brandeis of Boston to the
supreme court court bench. Repre
sentatives of the United Shoe Machin
ery company, with which Mr. Brandeis
was once associated as counsel, were
heard.
Mr. Brandeis' attitude as counsel for
the interstate commerce commission
in the 5 per cent rate case was vigor
ously attacked by Clifford Thorne,
chairman of the Iowa railroad com
mission, and was defended with equal
vigor by Lieutenant Governor John M.
Eshelman of California, president of
the California railroad commission at
the time the case was pending, at last
night's hearing before the sub-committee.
Concluding his testimony, Mr.
Thorne, who was associate counsel In
the rate case, appealed to the commit
tee not to confirm Mr. Brandeis, charg
ing that he conceded the cause of the
railroads, to the fatal injury of the
public interest.
Mr. Eshelman, in defending Mr.
Brandeis, expressed the belief that the
latter's action in the rate case was en
tirely justified.

LAWYERS PULLING
NET ABOUT WOMAN
IN MURDER TRIAL
Winterset, la., Feb. 10. Mrs. Ethel
Meyer's left-hand bore a powder mark
and fresh bruises were on her left
wrist, according to testimony given to
day'at the trial of Mrs. Ida Meyer, aged
CO, charged with complicity in the
murder of her daughter-in-law.
The testimony was offered for the
state by John Frankleberger, a mem
ber of the coroner's Jury which exam
ined the slain girl bride's body after
the shooting at the Meyer home near
here July 25 last.
Frankleberger testified that Ethel
Meyer was left handed and the re
volver with which Mrs. Ida Meyer and
her son, Fred, insisted the girl commit
ted suicide, lay beside her right hand
when the body was found.
He also said that he examined the
revolver and found it rusty. He in
sisted it had not been used for some
time.
Although a powerfully built man,
Frankleberger testified he found it a
difficult task to pull the trigger. Two
women, he said, tried to pull the trig
ger but could not. Then, he said, the
weapon had been handed to Mrs. Ida
Meyer, but she also failed. John Sum
merville of Winterset, also a member
of the coroner's Jury, largely corro
borated Franklebcrger's testimony.
Frankleberger testified that the de
fendant when before the coroner's Jury
had explained bloodstains on her
clothing by stating that she had dress
ed the dying girl's wounds.
It was the prevailing belief today
that neither Mrs. Ida Meyer, nor her
son Fred, sentenced to 15 years on the
same charge, will be put on the stand.
A photographer who attempted to
get Mrs. Meyer's picture was forced
out of her hotel here today. The aged
defendant has successfully prevented
the taking of her picture thus far and
is said to have destroyed existing
photographs.

Officials.

Note Sent Penfield Seeking
Austrian Investigation
of Affair.
Washington, Feb. 10. Secretary
Lansing announced today that he had
sent to the Austro-Hungarian govern
ment through Ambassador Penfield a
dispatch asking for investigation and
an explanation of the attack by an
Austrian submarine on the American
tank steamer Petrolite.
The secretary said published state
ments that demands had been made
on the Vienna government were "not
true," but that it was within the range
of possibility that demands of some
sort might be made in the future
should the investigation and explana
tion asked warrant them.
Mentions Affidavits of Crew.
The secretary's dispatch called at
tention to affidavits from members of
the crew of the Petrolite and to in
formation from other sources to the
effect that the ship was stopped in the
Mediterranean near Alexandria by an
Austrian submarine which fired on her
and wounded one man.
The submarine commander asked
for food which Captain Thompson of
the Petrolite refused. He then sent a
boarding party on the American ship
and removed one American, member
of her crew who was held as a hostage
while the Austrians took the food they
required from the Petrolite's stores.
Novel questions are involved in the
case. Warships under certain stress
may take food from merchantmen if
they give proper receipts or payment

Lusitania is
Chased Down
to a Reporter
New York, Feb. 10. On Feb. 7 Sec
retary of State Lansing made the fol
lowing statement in connection with
the Lusitania case: " j
"All I wish to say Is that this gov
ernment has not increased its de
mands in the Lusitania case, as set
forth in the notes of May 13, June 9
and July 21. I doubt very much it
Dr. Zlmmermann ever made such a
statement, because he must know it is
utterly false."
This was in reference to a state
ment attributed to Dr. Alfred Zimmer
mann, under-secretary for foreign af
fairs, in an Interview with the Asso
ciated Press published on Feb. 4, in
which he said:
"I do not understand America's
course. We had thought the submar
ine issue settled and the Lusitania
question on the way to an arrange
ment had agreed to pay indemnity
and all that when the United States
suddenly made its new demands, which
it is impossible for us to accept."
WTien Secretary Lansing's statement
was issued, the Associated Press ca
bled its correspondent in Berlin for
confirmation of the phrase attributed
to Dr. Zimmermann. Today that cor
respondent has cabled the following
statement:
"Berlin, Feb. 9. The text of the in
terview with Under-Secretary Zim
mermann was submitted to him and
approved by him before It was cabled.
Regarding the phrase 'new demands,'
it is literally exact. The correspond
ent immediately countered with a
question regarding the nature of these
demands without eliciting any answer."

THE WAR TODAY
Signs that a military operation
of importance may be impending
in the Balkans are famished by
the Bulgarian government organ at
Sofia, which asserts the right of
Bulgaria to invade Greece for an
attack on the French and British
there. Dispatches announcing a
notable concentration of Teutonic
allied troops and heavy artillery
along the Greek border have been
frequent.
Some movement of moment may
he developing at the northern end
of the Russian lines, where the ar
tillery play is reported as heavy
and continuous, particularly in the
neighborhood of Dvinsk. The
Russians profess confidence in the
security of their line there despite
the German heavy guns. In Galicia
they are on the aggressive and at
one point report crossing the
Dniester river.
In the west the initiative at
present seems with the Germans
who are hammering on the French
lines and making 'an occasional
gain, notably near Jfeuville, not far
below the Belgian border and
sonth of the river Somme.
Total Prussian losses in the war
are estimated by an Amsterdam
statistician at 2,377,378.
The bombardment of Smyrna on
the Asia Minor coast by a squad

Two German seaplanes yester
day dropped bombs in Kent coun

women and a child.
On the western battle front, be.
tween Lens and Arras, the French
and Germans are engaged in a se
vere combat. Berlin reports the
capture of French positions over a
length of 8(H) yards near the town
of Yimy. Paris admits that the
Germans secured a foothold in
part of a French trench but says
they were driven out by hand
grenade attacks. Paris also
claims that French batteries have
badly damaged German organiza

COUNTER FOR
STATESNOTE
Germany Gives Enemies Un
til March 1 to Clear Sea
of Gunned Ships.
ANSWER TO FEELERS?
Lansing Letters Questioning
Belligerents Believed
Responsible.
Berlin, Feb. 10, (by wireless to Say
vllle, N. Y.) The German government
is about to issue a memorandum to
neutral governments announcing that
hereafter armed merchantment be
longing to countries at war with Ger
many will be considered and treated
as warships.
The government contends this meas
ure is justified by explicit instructions
issued by the British admiralty to
merchantmen, a copy of which is said
to have been obtained by the German
authorities. These instructions, it is
understood here, were that the mer
chantmen should carry guns and at
tack the submarines on sight.
It is also stated these orders haye
a counterpart in instructions issued
by the governments of other 'countries
at war with Germany.
The German memorandum was com
municated to an American newspaper
correspondent by Dr. Alfred Zimmer
man, under-secretary of foreign af
fairs. Dr. Zimmerman said he believed
the memorandum was in harmony with
the ideas put forth in the American
government's proposals to belliger
ent nations in regard to the submarine
warfare, which he thought were calcu
lated to place this form of warfare on
a proper basis.
Notify United States.
Washington, Feb. 10. Germany and
Austria, through their embassies here,
have notified the United States of their
intention to treat armed merchant
men as warships after March 1. That
date was fixed to give the entente al
lies time to signify their intention .to
ward the recent note of the United
States proposing the disarmament of
all merchantmen.
