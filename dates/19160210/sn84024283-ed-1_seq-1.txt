Great Merger is Possible.
(From the Bonne Terre Star.)
There is an undercurrent of rumor
among the wise ones that there is being
planned by the higher powers in the
lead industry in this district a merger
that will include all the companies
now operating In the district.
It seems that the established com
panies, some of them, are strongly in
favor of getting the local lead land
situation into such shape that there
will be no possibility of mines being
developed in the district by other in
dividuals and companies and it is like
ly that as preliminary to a big mer
cer all the land on which there is a
possibility of there being lead will be
taken up in the very near future.
Men well posted on the situation
say that they know that there are rich
and paying bodies of land not as yet
owned by any of the companies and it
would be of advantage if the matter
of ore bodies were settled once for all
in this section and practically restrict
future operations by those already in
the field. . . A
I wandered in a eliur.ch yard when
the evening sun was low on the hill
side by a little Southern town, where
the good, the wise, the foolish, where
the wanton and the true, each, tired
grown, had laid the weary burden
down; and each costly , shaft of
marble, freighted with the .sculptor's
dream, and each less pretentious one
of common stones, bore upon its shin
ing surface, mellowed by the flight of
time, tender words arid loving tri
butes all its own. Eyes would once
have beamed with pleasure, but the
dews of death have come, moistened
long ago upon the pallid brow, hearts
would once have thrilled with glad
ness had those words been spoken
then, but those hearts are cold and
still and pulseless now; Then why
spare your words of kindness till the
even shadows fall, till the day is done
and night is. stealing on? Better far
one ...tllsy .blossom, blooming .by- the
road to-day than a wilderness of roses
when we're gone.

Editor Register I am always glad
to gi't the Register and I always
read it with interest.
In your issue of January 13th I find
an amusing article from the facile pen
of V. D. Lewis, president of the
Farmers' Union of Texas. He extolls
the skirts of women as it he thought
voting women wear trousers or over
alls. Woman's influence is ". also
greatly extolled by the worthy presi
'dent. In reply I quote from an article
by Jesse Lynch Williams: "As a
single instance the whol6 world has
heard of Judge Lindsay's children's
court.' The whole, world is now adopt
ing hia idea. According to Judge
Lindsay, himself, the whole. world
owes -this to the womeu voters: of
Denver, without whose aid the ma
chine would have prevented the
Judge's dream from coining true. If
we calculated the far-reaching effect
of this one thintr, which, most of us
can't calculate, it alone would be
enough to justify woman suffrage and
even suffragettes." i
"Why," he exclaims, "does -woman
chafe under restraint of sex?". W ell
we'll cite another incident in answer
to this query. 1 And this time I quote
from memory and I think it happened
in Mr. Lewis' own great state of Texas:
A certain worthless fellow forsook
his family and their care and support
devolved upon the mother and the
oldest boy, who was later injured, I
think by a railway train, and the
mother brought suit for damages and
. was about to win when the husband
and father turns up, compromises the
suit, collects the money and again
disappears, leaving the crippled son
and worse than widowed mother to
shift for themselves. '.-.J :
The above incident could not have
.. happened if the laws of that State
had not made the father the sole
cuardian of his children. That law
, was made by male voters.
And then farther down in the same
column, whether from the pen of the
same author is not clear to me, ap
pears the following: "God Almighty
gave Eve to Adam' with the pledge
that, she should be his Tielpmate, did
he?' Well, let's see, Genesis 1:27-28
"So "God created man in .his own
image. In the image of God created
he him; male and female created he
them and God blessed them and God
said tintothem, be faithful and multi
n.W and renlenish the earth ondianb-
F-j - i
due it- and have dominion over tne
fish of the sea and over the fowls of
the air and over every, living thing
that moveth upon the earth."
And then, if vou will turn over
to the fifth chapter of Genesis, you
will find the first and second verses
read like this: "This is the book of the
Generation of Adam, In the day that
. God created man in the likeness 'of
God made he him,, male and female
created he them, and blessed them
and called their name Adam in the
day whenthey were created."
Yes, there are are two accounts of
the creation and you can take your
choice; you can believe that God
made a pair, of human beings equal
partners for life, having- dominion
" over all the earth, or you can Relieve
the rib story, that woman was an at
t.er thoueht. and that if God hadn't
noticed that Adam was lonely he
would never have made woman at
' all. That the joys of mother love
that have filled the- world with song
and story and create the most holy
and noble feelings in the human
breast are the results of an after
' thought of Godl ... - 1
Yes, you can believe that if your
head and heart are constructed just
right, but as for me I can't. I must
.believe with the first account that
God created them free and equal
that he didn't give Eve to Adam any
more than he cave Adam' to Eve.
They were friends"; oomlades, com
panions and lovers. And the man or
woman who seeks to' boss the other
. is abnormal.

Ed. Register Having been a close
' reader of tho Register for two years
I have become an admirer of your
clear and Independent way of think
ing as expressed in your short edito
rials. With many of your thoughts I
am In perfect sympathy. You are a
' man in politics who can see the faults
of your own party, and, your love for
your country being greater than for
- party, permits you. to publicly criti
cise the Democrats, as well as the Re
publicans. J f '"
, In your outspoken criticism of ex
1 tremists In religion I am with you. In
your remarks about a certain evange
list who was holding a successful re
vival at our stale capital at Jefferson
(Stv vou said:. "Our, conscience and
renA4n should be our culde." Yon
criticism of this evangelist brought to
mv mind the sharp reproof tne urn-
' jste it ad ministered to the writer years
ago while he was holding a meetlngn
the Presbyterian Church in Ironton.
I can see now bow entlwsiasui and
faith can smother reason in such a
way as to hide the truth whioh Is so
preulons.
I wished to accept your cordial In
vitation last spring to write for'.tha
Reoihtkb. My motive is to hnJp the
public in the territory In which your
paper circulates. I wish to .addrcus

it?" I would like to answer this
question in two frays and add a ques
tion to it. Over three score years ago
I listened to a temperance lectrre and
this is all I remember of it: "The
drunkards will never be dead, and I
will tell you the reason why; the
young ones grow up before the old
ones die." What will the merchant?
in Arcadia Valley do, tor the young
props will slowly grow up as the old
ones die? The cash for the props will
more slowly come in, as the thieves
will move south and cross over into
Reynolds county for their props and
ties. Now we do not wish anyone to
infer from this that we are not cursed
with timber thieves in Reynolds coun
ty, for we are. Our surveyor has told
me he has looked up land owned by
parties in other states, which has all
the timber cut off from the land by
timber thieves. . -
In the second local below the timber
thief local we read, "A letter received
from Mr. F. T. Hunt' a few days ago
says he is still a very sick man.
Centerville Outlook." Now we know
it is not considered nice for one to
write or speak about themselves in
public. Twpyears ago in writing to one
or our country papers we made this
statement: "I would not write of mv
elicion or private business if I could
accomplish what I hoped to without
it." My work wasnearlv finished last
UctoDer when 1 was taken very sick
with liver and kidney trouble, and for
inree monins 1 nave Deen in pain and
misery with no hope of recovery. One
of my greatest joys m my affliction is
that I may through my, pen, help
others. All thoughtful men know
that the great need of the word is love
and knowledge. What eood would
our knowledge do those Door suffering
millions in Europe if we had no love
for them? What good would our love
ao tnem it we had not the knowledge
luvcui larm umumnery, OUUd good

ships and keep open the great high
way across the ocean which the
president of the United States is try
ing to do? . .'
We are pleased to notice that all our
country papers are trying to arouse
the public to use means to sfcoD the
timber stealing arid hog stealing which
is prevuieui) in iron anu tteynolds
counties. 11 may in time do awav

witn mis curse wnicn gives our coun
ties such a bud name. They have ar
rested a lew of these poor, ignorant
devils and put them in jail. But I am
sure there is a quicker way. Let me
get at those who.are higher up, who
are waning property tnatooes not be

It would create a great sensation if
