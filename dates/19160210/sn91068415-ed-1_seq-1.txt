A GREAT FORWABD STEP
High Point to Be Linked Together
with Best Road in the Country
Work to Commence Soon.
It is good news that has been flashed
over the country that Guitfordcounty
takes the lead in building the high
est grade road bed for a distance of
15 miles.
' The board of county commission
ers, Tuesday voted unanimously to
borrow a sum not to exceed $125,-
OUU with which to construct imme
diately, between "Gieensboro and
High Point, a concrete-asphalt high
way. Between four and five miles
of such highway has already been
built, something over two miles
from each point, and there remains
approximately 10 miles to be con
structed. It is estimated that the
work will cost about $12,500 per
mile.
! I ?1 1 , 1
ine wor& win oe aone Dy con
tract being the intention of the
board to have the improvement
made by a force outside of the
county convicts, so that the latter
may be used continuously on im
provement and repair work in other
sections of the county. The new
highway which is to be of the very
highest class to be found in the
United States, will be completed
during the coming summer. It will
be the finest section of roadway to
be found in North Carolina, connect
iug the best two towns in the state;
and Will likewise be the finest link
in this state of the National and
Central highways. It will be
model by which other counties may
be guided in future highway lm
provetiients.

leather by British representatives
causes hides to soar and even the
U. S. government is called upon to
pay the increase "on account of Jhe

interested parties. There are 1600
North State subscribers, scores of
whom would: have been present,
representing every trade and . busi

are many at i nomas vine and Lex

consolidation with the Bell Tele
phone Co. So the crowd present
last night were ONLY the ones ask
6d to come out to the meeting
? f it developed at the meeting that
itiwas consolidation of the-nlants
that was desired by the Bell Tele
phone Co. more than the long dis
tance connection: which manadAr
Hayden of the North State Co. offer
ed to make. But the local company
is not favorable to a proposition with
a company that has' onlv 86 phones
in the city and a big investment
against the North' State (Vs. 1600
connections as it would be a tremend
our burden to shoulder such a con
solidation proposition even with a
big increase in rates which would
naturally follow. The Bell plant
could not be used at all for some
time.
- More than a thousand merchants
manufacturers, other business con
cerns ana maiviauais are averse to
the proposition and will sneak out
when given a chance.

PLEASE do not think rme the im
personation of pessimism if I take oc
casion in this "telk" to enlarge some
what upon the difficulties that I last
week told you would surround n en
deavor to enter the mdtioa picture pro
fession. As a matter of fact I am
ceedingly optimistic. I believe that
there is no one who has a more abun
dant or a longer abiding faitn n tue eff:.
cacy of ambition and hard determined
work.
It you are coins: to try to get into Die
tures, there is a . safe and sensible way
or you to start about it and that is with
aa expectation that you are to experience
a real struggle ana will have reason to
call upon every ounce of courage and
patience you possess. '
- U i. .
lueiciuic i'm. goinj: iOj warn you
against two enemies to vour. success.
One is the irresponsible stories you have
read about in this or that actress who has
fallen immediately into star roles and
big salary with no effort ; or fight for
what she got; the other is your well
meaning but deluded friends who tell
you that you are as beautiful and talent
as any one appeaneg on tne screen,
w'uum consequently aemana as
much recognition and- salary,, and de
maod it with no delay.
I can tell you honestly that there is no
one who has achieved anything in the
motion picture profession who has not
worked hard for her success. The
struggle with, some have been more
obivous than with others,' but, whether
it has been seen or not, the struggle has
Deen mere in every case and the success
has been the reward of exit and fi?ht.
When your friends tell you how easily
you witKsucceea in pictures, thank them
as politely as you can, but do not take
their words too much to heart Our
director tells xae that the girls who apply
to him for a "trial" because their friends
are sure of their, immediate success, are
each day numerous enough to furnish
every producing company in the' United
States with a leading woman. : A very
few of these many applicants will some
day, be sure enough leading women, but
they, are the ones' who will the most
successfully disregard what their friends
have said, and consequently be the more
ready to start out with a determination
to work and wait until success is theirs-
Why Shoulder a White W
phant? :1-:M::
, We can't see why High Point is
inconvenienced by the local tele
phone company failing to consolidate
with the. Bell. " It is believe i that
ninety per cent of its 1600 subscri
bers do not care for a more extehrU'.-
ed long distance ?than now in use ;
bat that it's onlythe very few who
care to talk to New York and San
Francisco from their office and these
calls are far between. -The Jocaf
company is in connection with the
Postal Telegraph Company l and
reaches all important cities - in the
south and southwest (and no doubt ;
this connection is what caused the
Bell Company to see a dhnstV Th
local company also reaches many "
points in the state over its own lines
and the service, both local and long
distance, is just about half what Is v
charged by the Bell. We do not be- '
lieve the people are willing to pay
the double rate to be charged just to.
please, a few people, which wmJd
i have to be the case if the local con.. '
pany consolidated with the Bell:
which has a v $50,000 investment
here with only 86 subscribers
against the North Sfate Compauyv i
with a similar investment and 1600"
connections. It doesn't take a philr: y
sopher to see the difference. Pray
icii us u such an investment wouja
appeal to any business "concern in
High Point86 phones and $50,000
investment? Not one ner cent, net
profit after deducting operating ex-vr i
penses, etc. Then why want home ' : ;
people to shoulder a white elephant?.. ;,;
The local company will no doubtS !
be glad to give the long distance:
service to any point not reached by '
its company but consolidation is i ;
another thing." " '
With a raise of.' rates following
such a sten where' would nnvrhim v'
be saved ia the one phone system : .
two phones now only eo3t what one '
phone will cost with consolidation ' -
so the Bell phone coul be used ' no w
entirely for long distance and the-
North State for local and yet the
price would beino more than with1 ''; j
the proposed charge;. r A i
