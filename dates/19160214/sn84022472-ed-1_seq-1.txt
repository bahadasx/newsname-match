expected that there would be little
or no opposition to the selection of
this city. The convention, which
probably will be held before the mid
dle of May, will elect 14 Relegates and
alternates to the national convention
in St. Louis.
. Two of Bridgeport three members
of the coMmittee were represented.
.Patrick H. Brady, of the Twenty-Sec-.
ono aisincv wa present in person,
and CoL T. J. Murphy held the proxy
of Michael J. Clabby, of, the Twenty

of the storm and cold weather, and it
was after noon when the advance
guard of committeemen and others
arrived at The Stratfield. . .
' Patrick B. O'Sullivan of Derby, secretary-
of the committee,- was a bit
belated in arriving, and David E. Fitz
gerald, of New Haven, ', the chairman,

derwater Vessels Plan
ned By Uncle Sam

a type to eclipse in strength, arma
ment, and cruising radius the famous
U-boats of . the German navy are

plete rapid-fire armament and la ex
pected to have a cruising radius of
nearly 5,000 miles, at about 10 knot
under water and 21 knots or better on

Helen Montague Takes
Days For Eight Days'
Journey Along Coast.
The Helen jMontague Capt.' James
Balmer, from St, John's, Nova Scotia,
with a cargo of lumber for the Frank
Miller Lumber Co., limped into port
this morning under Jury-rig, reporting
one of the roughest trips in the 30
years' experience of the skipper.
With her ,f ore-topmast and back
stays partedL ; her bow, sides, deck
load and furled sails coated with
shimmering ice and with a. short
handed crew, the Montague showed
the effects of storm. Captain Balmer
talked freely of his troubles as the big
three master finally lav at her berth
at East Washington avenue.
To (add, to difficulties from storm,
conditions forced 'the good ship into
flve'ports on.'the way down, consum
ing 22 days, against which !the usual
eight required in clear weather, the
British government had sought him in
connection ;with a former seaman,
now in the Dorchester penitentiary.
He had a- desertion, too, at Portland,
Me., that is Denevea Dy me crew io
mean . that a German spy made , his
s;et-away from Nova Scotia in the nick
of time, but left the crew short-handed
alnd without the happlnctss of a
"cooky" that.js so essential in time of
storm... v v
Captain Balmer reports speaking
the schooner American Team, code
J. R. S. T., of Rockland, Me., long
overdue at the Singer Manufacturing
Co,-Brldgepo.i. tb American ream
was lying tq for repairs off Gloucester.
Thr Montague is a three-masted
schooner, hailing from Boston, crew
of seven men, 370 tons burden ind
carried a deckload of 406,000 feet of
spruce planking for the local concern.
Not a strip had been lost overboard
though the head -.seas had continu
ously washed ove fore and aft.
Speaking of the trip today the skip
per said: "We left. St. John's with
fair winds. .We had 1 not sooner left
the Bay of, Fondy than we encounter
ed Aiead-seas and winds that kept us
awash most of the time. The snow
and sleet was hard on the men and
encased the spars and riggings la
heavy Ice. On the sixth day we
struck a sudden squall. In trying to
let the topsails go, as we labored un
der the blow, we found that they were
fast. It was necessary that men be
sent aloft to cut away the frozen
ropes. - i - . .
"The back -stays parted on the fore
topmast and she went by the board.
As we lay-to we managed to recover
the broken mast, and sails, which we
later cut down and re-riggel, coming
through with the jury rigging." ' A
The broken mast caused much com
ment ' as the ship came upy the bay
under tow this morning.
"Bill" Libby, the cook who had been
shipped at St, Johns, N. B., went over
the side at Portland, where th&-JVfon-tague
. put in under storm signals.
Libby was supposed by the British
authorities to be an Englishman, but
there were rumors among the crew
today that he was a German spy who
sought information for His government
and took the first opportunity to get
out of St. Johns, where nearly J00,
000 men1 are now training for service
at the front. He made his escape by
sliding down a rope and into a dory
waiting for him alongside the ship just
as It was clearing Portland.
A letter which reached Capt. Balmer
Just as he got under way in St. Johns
harbor frorin the Dominion Parole of
fice asked information about James
Reginald Evans, a forrrfer sailor on the
Montague. It apppears that Evans,
believed to be an American sailor, Is
under arrest but the charge' on which
he is held is not specified. The schoon
er" did not return to answer the ques
tions asked by the Dominion prison
authorities but a letter was sent from
this port today giving him a clean
b'U of health while working on the.
ship.
The severity of the storms encoun
tered by the Montague may be seen by
the necessity of the ship putting in at
Brandford harbor, Little Machias,
Boothbay, Me., Portland, Me.; Glou
cester, Mass., and passing through the
newly opened Cape Cod canal.
"It is one of the worst trips I have
ever made," said Capt. Balmer today.
At the Singer Sewing Machine Co.
In this city it is said that no report of
the schooner American Team coming
to Bridgeport has been received from
their New York offices. It is local be
