didates for re-election. They are
Mayor William McCuaig George
Stein, city clerk George W. Rhea,
city treasurer T. J. Lloyd, assessor
J. P. Lahr, alderman of the First
ward Tom Smart, alderman of the
Second ward Paul Foucault, alder
man of the Third ward, and R. E.
Miller, alderman of the Fourth ward.
Campaign Quiet.
The campaign for city officers has
been one of the most quiet in the his
tory of Bemidji. However, effective
work has been done by all the can
didates.
With the exception of the First
ward place, the Socialists have an en
tire ticket in the field.
Has Good Terms.
It was pointed out today that "if
one good term deserves another,"
surely three good terms deserve rec
ognition at the hands of the people.
Mayor McCuaig has been elected
mayor of Bemidji three timesthe
last time with but little opposition
because the people generally realized
that he was a man particularly well
qualified for the position, who could
not be coaxed or driven into doing
any act or thing detrimental to the
welfare of the city.

MAYOR WMJ'CUAlb
FOR RE-ELECTION
PRESENT EXECUTIVE
HAS EXCELLENT RECORD
McCuaig Stands for Economy and
Strict Enforcement of All
Laws.
CAMPAIGNS HAVE BEEN
MOST aUIET IN YEARS
Tomorrow Bemidji will hold a city
election. The polls will be open at
six o'clock in the morning and will
close at nine in the evening.
Every one is exhorted to get out
to vote. The exercise of franchise
should be the ambition of every male
in the city and those to whom that
right now belongs should under no
circumstances fail to vote.
Voting Places.
The following are the polling
places:
First WardMiller's store.
Second WardCity hall.
Third WardLog building in rear
of Dicaire's store.
Fourth WardDalton building, on
Third street.
The offices for election are mayor,
city clerk, city treasurer, assessor and
an alderman from each ward.
McCuaig for Economy.
He has always stood for the most
rigid economy, but at the same time
was always ready and willing to aid
in public improvements required and
made necessary by the steady growth
of Bemidji.
Prosecutes Violators.
During his administration Bemidji
has changed from a "saloon town" to
a "saloonless city," a change which
a great many predicted would result
in open and wide-spread violations of
the law. Yet Mayor McCuaig by his
fearless prosecution of those at
tempting to evade the law, has prac
tically stamped out all illegal traffic
in intoxicating liquor.
McCuaig is Consistent.
Mayor McCuaig has at all times
"been a consistent, persistent and in
telligent booster for Bemidji and
Northern Minnesota. During his
encumbency of the office he has been
instrumental in bringing to Bemidji
numerous conventions for the better
ment and uplift of Bemidji and its
people, and with the hearty and co
operation of the city council has
caused many permanent improve
ments to be made, chief among which
might be mentioned the magnificent
steel bridge across the Mississippi
near the outlet.
Draws Favorable Comment.
Mayor McCuaig is the only mayor
of Bemidji who ever attended a meet
ing of the League of Minnesota Muni
cipalities. He attended the meeting
at St. Peter two years ago and by
his active participation in that meet
ing drew very favorable comment
from the newspapers.
Why Change Now?
Not a single argument can be used
against his re-election or, in fact,
not a single argument has been used
except that he has held the office
three terms.
If he has made a good chief execu
tive for three terms, as even his op-

BEMIDJI HAS A MAYOR
Bemidji has a mayor. Bemidji not
only has a mayor, but it has "some"
mayor. Mayor William McCuaig is
not necessarily a prohibitionist, but
he has it "doped out" that a man
dealing in liquor without a license is
breaking the law, and he has taken
and is taking decided steps to have
the law-breaking stopped in the town
of which he is the official head.
Mayor McCuaig does not forget that
when liquor dealers sell booze in his
town, it is not merely a violation of
the Indian treaty, but of the laws of
the state and the city -of Bemidji, and
he is not one to stand l\y and let the
laws be broken when is his duty
to see to it that they are not.Grand
Rapids Independent.(Reprinted by
the Bemidji Sentinel.)
ponents admit, why change now?
Any officer improves with experi
ence and it is safe to say that if re
elected Mayor McCuaig by his ex
perience will be better able to dis
charge the duties of the office better
than ever before.
Vote for Mayor William McCuaig
for re-election.

Plans for -the introduction of game

In part, Mr. Blair said: "We have
lately made arrangements with the
state to take part in our Big Island
game farm and everything is pro
gressing nicely so far. We expect to
be able to send out consignments of
pheasants, grouse and quail to the
branches next fall for the refuges
they have established, and if every
thing works out all right you can de
pend upon getting a nice lot of birds
for Bemidji. They will not cost any
thing and in this way we hope to
interest other towns into forming
branches and getting on the job."

ACCUSED OF ST. PAUL
BIG STAMP ROBBERY
Edward Leonard, Who Formerly Was
in. Commission Business Here,
is Arrested.
MAY HAVE BEEN ONE WHO
ROBBED CANADIAN BANK
Believed to Have Committed Hold-up
at Hotel Markham Last
Year.
Edward Leonard, alias Lutowsky,
who was arrested in Chicago Friday
charged with complicity in the theft
of $575,000 worth of documentary
stamps from the St. Paul Federal
building on the night of Jan. 6, was
formerly a resident of Bemidji.
Ran Road House.
In the nineties Leonard ran a road
house 15 miles north of this city.
During the safe-blowing epidemic of
1895 his place was suspected as a
rendezvous for yeggmen but there
was never sufficient evidence to start
prosecution. Many strangers, in-'
eluding visitors from Chicago, stop
ped at his place. Later Leonard con
ducted a saloon at Tenstrike until
it was destroyed by a Are. He moved
to this city and entered the commis
sion business. He went to Seattle
about six years ago and has visited
in Bemidji several times since.
Connected With Robberies.
The arrest of Leonard in Chicago
may clear up several robberies in this
territory. Leonard is known to have
been in Bemidji last year when the
Hotel Markham was robbed of sev
eral hundred dollars. The police be
lieve that Leonard "pulled off the
job." Other affairs which are try
ing to be connected with Leonard
are the bank robbery at Wadena, the
postoffice robbery in Bemidji about
ten years ago and the robbing of the
Bemidji elevator about six years ago.
Mrs. Leonard, who is well known
here, was also arrested with Leonard
in Chicago.
Lived at Big FaUs..
Mr. and Mrs. J. J. Zeck, who were
also arrested on- the same charge as
Leonard, were formerly residents of
Big Falls where Mr. Zeck conducted
a saloon.
George Brissett and Frank Bissett,
other members of Leonard's party,
are also believed to have been located
here years ago.
Others arrested are M. J. Flani
gan of Chicago and his wife, Mrs.
Catherine Flanigan.
The prisoners will be brought to
St. Paul for trial.
Seek Leonard's Friend.
Chicago police are today seeking
Fred Hoffman, who was a friend of
Leonard's. Edward Kreil, Chicago,
another friend of Leonard, was ar
rested today, but after being ques
tioned was released. Hoffman was
sought at the time that the others
were being followed. He was.trail
ed for seven days and while Leonard
and his crowd were being arrested,
he disappeared.
All prisoners are being held in
$100,000 bonds.
Leonard is "Brains."
The robbery of the St. Paul rev
enue office was directed from Minne
apolis and the stamps were taken
there in an automobile, afterward
being removed in trunks to Chicago.
Federal authorities say that Leon
ard was the "brains of the gang."
Letters found in Leonard's effects in
dicate that he may have been im
plicated in the robbery of the New
Minster branch of the Bank of Mon
treal, Sept. 1, 1911, when $272,000
was stolen.
Loot to Minneapolis.
Following the blowing of the safe
in the St. Paul federal building,
secret service operatives learned that
the loot was taken in a Ford automo
bile to Minneapolis where a room
was rented by Mrs. Flanigan. Gas
bill receipts were signed by G. V.
Thomas who proved to be Leonard.
The automobile in which the
stamps were taken was found Thurs
day in the Blue Island yards of the
Rock Island Railway Co., in Chicago.
Trunk is Sent.
Following the robbery, different
members of the band made various
trips to Chicago, taking with them
part of the stamps at a time. A large
trunk with the last portion was sent
Friday.
Stamps Found.
A large squad of secret service men
and Chicago police officials arrested
Mr. and Mrs. Leonard Friday morn
ing. In Leonard's rooms were found
thousands of stamps hidden under
the floor behind a book case and in
other places.
