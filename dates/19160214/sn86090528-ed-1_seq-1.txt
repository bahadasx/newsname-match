No Surp'us Left from Preceding Year;

OKLAHOMA CITY, Feb. 14. Slaty
Auditor K. B Howard, In response to
many requests, hat prepared a statu
lnent (xplaining the factors that en
ter into llio higher tax rate of thW
year. The stutenient in in part si
follows:
"As to the 1315 assessment, when
the present board of equalization be
tun to mako the asse'sitnont tliey
found that the 1813 legislature had
made appropriations for deficiencies
which hat! h lie covered by the tax
levy this year, of I,4C6,CS1.33, and
that to this there must be added the
I'M per cent for delinquent taxes, ma!-'
1ug a total cf t,7.0,0'7.t:o in deficleu
tics that a levy was net'.'ssary . t'.
lover. However, we found that there
were estimated cash receipts that
cwild le charged against this in tb
amount of $372,8.33.17,. after the dedui
lion of which left a net deficiency levy
for the year 1915 of $1,1S7,1S4.33. This
amount, while treated a ft deficiency
appropriation by reason of bein.
de.li'i; f br th lesif'mture f'r the
w ' .
.ear eiuiins June HO. li'l... was in
reality an appropriation covering e
penditures n ade for the purpose i:
bi.llding new buildings at the Okla
bon;a hospital for the insane at Snp
ply, for purchasing the Uoptials for
insan? at Norman, buildings at the
East Oklahoma hospital for Insane at
initia, for buildings at the feeble
winded institute at Knld, buildings ai
the blind school at Muskogee, build
ings at the deaf and dumb school at
Sulphur, Improvements, etc., at the
Oklahoma stato penitentiary and re
formalory and for the permanent Im
provements at the different educa
tional and eleemo-ynnry institutions.
Including building at the university
jut Norman and the central state nor
mal school at Fdmond.
"AUer finding the levy neccarv
to cover these deficiencies to be i
mil!, we found that for itato expense;
fur the currtnt fiscal year 1'K the
legislature, bad appropriated $2,907.
7h-". 17. which it will be noted Is about
$17,000 le? monev for expen-es for
the year 1910 than was appropriated
for the year 101.3. The -hoard, how
ever, found it necessary to add the
JO per cent for delinquents, which
made a to'.ul tc bo raised for this cur
rent year of n.4S042.2 Makin?
im estimate of $1,115,013.54 as an in
come from sources otner ui.u.
valorem tuxes, this loaves the sum
of S2.374.3.S.06 to be raised by an ad
valorem tax levy, which upon an as
tcssed valuation of the state of St.
'.87.164.S2S. it will be found that it
was necessary to make a 2 mill levy
to raise tl Is amount. Tho difference
therefore, hi the levy of 1915 and of
-116 being that while there was less
money appropriated for current state
expenses, the state board of equallza
f lion did not havo the i.-io.
? turplus to fall back upon, as was the
case for the former year. Conseouent-
ly it was necessary to make a higher
levy to meet the expenses as per the
I appropriations.
(In addition to this, the last legls
lature passed a highway law which re
quires that the state board of equal -
... ., . i,. r nr.R-fotirth nil"
for highways This was a new stats
levy, but is in no way used for laK'
Ins care of any state expenditures, the
law providing that all of it shall be
returned to the counties from whio.i
it came. It will bo seen from the fore
ping that bad it not been necessary
for the legislature to build build ns
and make the improvements for which
appropriations were made, and ban
the board of equalization had the aur
plus referred to. it would not have
ibeen necessary' to have made a tax
levy for 19 1G any hither than this one
lor 1015.
"Of course, naturally the citizens
are interested in khowius why these
deficiencies reierrtd to were neces
n ry. The only reason I can give is
that having been connected with the
:iate government for the luj.t five
yearn, I have been cognizant of con
ditions. In It'll, when I became a
member of the state board of public
nrratrs, l round that the average pop
illation of the Oklahoma state peniten
tiary was 1,030, while today we hav
1 441.
"At the reformatory there were 170,
its ."gainst "77 this year.
"About 13 patients were .be-in
cared for in 1011 at the institute for
feeble minded, as against 200 for the
fiscal year.
"At the hospital for the Insance at

as against "SO at this time.
At Norman there were 9I4 pa
tients, as against 1,030 at this time
At tiie Vinita no'lum there are

not in existence in 1911.

using profane language, being drunk
and having knucks on his person, was

the streets of Chickasha. One hour
after tho tiiuo the gentleman was
