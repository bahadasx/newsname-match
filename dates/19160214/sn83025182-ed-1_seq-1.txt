So far only the smaller points which
Boat be covered in a statement em
bodying the government's attitude,
feave beqp, determined. The view the
idministratlMTwlll take in the event
of Americans being on board tor
pedoed ships, however, is said to b9
decided. Whether a warning Issued
to American citizens to stay off armed
merchantmen would relieve the cen
tral powers of any liability for dam
ages is one of the most difficult prob
lems presented. No conclusion on
this point has been reached.
The state department was advised
today that photographs of the British
orders to ship captains to "ram or
ran," when they meet submarines, are
on the way from Germany.
After perusal of the German notifi
cation today, state department offi
cials said Germany draws no distinc
tion between passenger and freight
vessels. The name "merchantmen"
Includes both classes of ships.
While state department official*
were studying the G«rman pronuncia
mento, the text of Austria's decree
arrived and will be sent to the presi
dent with the one from Berlin. It la
much shorter than the German paper,
but constrains practically the same
arguments.
The German announcement, Secro
tary Lansing said, probably will be
given to the press tomorrow morning:
the Austrian communication the same
afternoon.
It was practically admitted today
that if the United States takes a
German view, the state department
will have to go beyond a mere re
striction of harbor faoilities for armen
merchant ships and a warning to
Americans to keep off such vessels.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 14.—President
Wilson, it became known in high offi
cial circles today, is In perfect accord
with Secretary Lansing as to the pol
icy to be pursued regarding the teu
tonic decree that all armed merchant
men, passenger as well as freight,
will be torpedoed without warning.Tha
president, his close advisors say, co&
siders the issues which may arise
through carrying out of the new teu
tonic submarine policy, fraught wlth|
possibilities as grave, if not more so,
than any which have confronted the
nation since the first shot of the
European war was fired.

across the Atlantic, it would not neces
sarily keep them oft armed ships using
other lanes of travel.
Inasmuch as it is admitted that a
mere warning would not relieve the
United States of responsibility for the
welfare of Americans who might dis
regard the warning, it is regarded as
practically certain that the depart
ment's representatives in this country
and abroad would be Instructed to re
fuse passports to Americans desiring
to travel on armed ships.
The form of acceptance of entente
powers to the proposals of Secretary
Lansing for the disarmament of their
merchant vessels are expected to
reach the department vrlthin the next
day or two. Owing to the limited time
remaining before March 1, the Ameri
can attitjidj will have to be known
this weefcT Therefore the crfsls~i£^t£
develops, will arise within a few day*.
State department Officials are in
clined to minimize the threats of re
prisals made In entente quarters. They
declare that it would be fool hardy
for the allies, dependent as they are
on American munitions of war, to at
tempt to cripple the general foreign
trade of the United States by with
holding the use of their merchant
ships. Such an. attempt, they indicate,
may well lead to the passage by con
gress of an embargo on the shipment
of war supplies.

NEW YORK, Feb. 14.—Following
twenty-four hours of wind, snow and
sleet, with the lowest temperature of
the year, two above zero, a storm
warning from the New York weather
bureau today gave promise that the
worst is yet .to come.
"Hoist storm warnings from Cape
Hatteras to Boston," said the weather
bureau's bulletin.
New York was covered with a coat

was delayed. Wire communication

AMERICAN WOMAN IS HELD
I AS PRISONER BY BULGARIANS
Mrs. Farwell, who was acting as
correspondent for a Chicago news
paper, was caught in Monastir when
the Bulgars occupied the city. Sev
eral weeks ago, according to reports
brought to Salonika, she was roughly
handled by Bulgarian soldiers who
raided the American Red Cross head
quarters and connscated supplies of
flour. Though permitted to move
about freely, she has not been allow
ed to leave the city despite efforts in
her benalf made by her husband.
Several Americans today appealed to
the Greek foreign office to use Its in
fluence to secure her release. Greece
consented to aid in every way pos
sible, but suggested American Minis
ter Garrett Droppers take the first
step. Droppers, however, said he was
unable to act because he had no in
structions from Washington. Consul
John Kehl at Salonika who was for
many years consul at Itettin, Ger
many, also refused to obtain a report
from the Greek consul from Monastir
unless specially instructed by the
state department.
Americans here believe that Wash
ington has been deceived by the Bul
garian authorities into believing Mrs.
Farwell wishes to remain in Monastir.
According to the Greek consul, who
protested vigorously against his own
^pulsion, she is an-rtooa to leave.

GERMAN GAINS.
LONDON, Feb. 14.—German troops
have made the most successful drive
against the French lines since their
defeat at the battle of the Marne early
in the war, the Berlin war office
claimed this afternoon.'
In the last forty-eight hour* of fight
ing, Berlin reported, the teutons have
captured nearly a mile of French posl
tiona In the Champagne region, as
well as 400 yards by an unexpected
smash In the Vosges. No greater Ger
man gain since'the battle of the
Marne has been reported on the west
ern front, excepting the defeat admin
istered to the British at Yprea last
May.
The French war office this after
noon admitted the loss of 200 yards to
the Germans in the Vosges fighting.
The official statement issued at Paris,
however, was silent on the operations
in the Champagne, where the Ger
mans report gains on a wide front.
Continuing their battering taotlcs
against the French left wing, the teu
tons stormed 700 yards of French
trenches northwest of Lasure, Berlin
reported this afternoon. The gain
was l/v the same region where the
Germans Saturday reported the cap
ture of 700 yards of French positions.
•"ftw reported advance carries the
Germans southward toward the
sto-ongly fortified French block house

LONDON, Feb. 14.—By battering
blows south of Saint Marie, the Ger
mans are making desperate efforts to
drive a wedge in the French line
with the object of. bending back the
whole French front in the Cham
pagne.
The German smash has been suc
cessful, according to Berlin des
patches. They report gains on the
French left wing that more man off
set the advance made by the Frenon
on their right, In the fighting north
west of Massiges.
Both Berlin and Paris agree that
the fighting in the Champagne is
heavier than at any time since the
French rushed forward in the great
offensive movement of last Septem
ber.
In several respects, the present
struggle, though less violen^ paral
lels the September offensive. In Sep
tember the French drive hit the Ger
man line hardest around Maison De
Champagne. The German counter at
tack, as In the present fighting, was
delivered with the greatest force on
the French left.
Official despatches from both capi
tals indicated heavy slaughter with
no Important changes either In the
Champagne or the Artois. The
"nibbling" of the past two weeks Is
believed to have resulted In casual
ties of between 75,000 and 100,uOO.
The fighting is now spreading to
nearly every sector of the front, the
Germans mostly on the offensive.
There is nothing thus far, however,
in the reports of the shelling to In
dicate artillery preparation by the
Germans for the predicted grand of
fensive.
OFFICIAL REPORT.
PARIS, Feb. 14.—German troops
captured 200 yards of French
trenches east of Seppols In upper Al
sace, the French war office admitted
in an official statement this after
noon, but most of the lost ground
was retaken by a French counter aV
tack.
The war office statement indicated
no Important changes in the situation
in the Champagne or north of Arras
where the Germans and French have
been locked in desperate struggles for
more than forty-eight hours.
The German onslaught in upper Al
sace was preceded by a most violent
bombardment that wrecked portions
of French trenches. Before the Teu
tons could dfg themselves in, they
were driven out of most of the newly
conquered positions.
The war office reported a French
victory In a bloody encounter at the
village of Frlse, south of the Somme.
"Sunday afternoon we captured
several German trenches," said the
official statement.
"The Germans counter attacked. A
German company was decimlnated ex
cepting seventy men, who were made
prisoners.
"The German losses were consider
able."

SOFIA, (via Amsterdam) Feb. 14.—
Bulgarian troops on Saturday occu

and are moving westward to join the
Austrians in cutting off the Italian
retreat from Durazzo. The war office
reported today that the people of El

Bulgarian vanguards are now less
than twenty miles from the Austrian
army approaching Durazzo from the
country west of Tlarana and the two
forces are In constant communica

three miles to the Adriatic seacoast,
the Bulgarians will complete the en

WAS IT CASE OF SUICIDE
OR A MURDER PLOT?
Death of School Girl is Puzzle
to Officials Who Hold
Young Orpet.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
WAUKEGAN, 111., Feb. 14.—Wheth
er the mysterious death of Marian
Lambert was a plot, paralleling the
death of Miss Avis Linnell, for which
Rev. Clarence Richeson died in the
Massachusetts electric chair, or a sui
cide under strange circumstances,
was still unsolved toady.
Even the Lake county officials who
have preferred a murder Charge
against Wm. H. Orpet, University of
Wisconsin junior, in connection with
Miss Lambert's death, admitted today
that they cannot tell.
The poison which killed Miss Lam
bert. had not been definitely deter
mined today, but authorities said it
evidently was a strange combination
of cyanide of potassium and Bulphuric
acid. fh«"se chemicals were used in
ki.iing garden insects by the elder
Lambert and the elder Orpet. If
Marian had sought to commit suicide,
she could have obtained access to
them.
One phase of the tragedy which
added to Its mystery was the assur

not in the condition her letters to
Orpet indicated she feared. Phvsician9
who conducted the post mortem on

was no reason she should have taken

He asked to see his jnother and it

The anaolog.v between the Riche

Prosecutor Dady was still further
emphasized by the presence in each
case of "the other woman" as mo

ed as "lights o' love." In the Riche

daughter of a rich man. In the Lam

motive for Marian's death as Orpet
hoped to marry her.
fn their search for the poison which
caused the Lambert girl's death, offi
cials today encountered a tangle ol
possibilities. Young Orpet himself
had studied chemistry at Madison and
had access to the laboratory. Misa
Lambert studied chemistry at ner
high school and could have secured
the poison there. The parents of
Orpet and of Marian had poisons in
their custody, used in horticulture in
the gardens ot the estates whera
they are employed. And Miss Youker,
whom Orpet has visited at Dekalb,
is a chemistry instructor at a normal
college there. Prosecutor Dady said
Orpet had access to her laboratory.
