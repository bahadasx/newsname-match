Reserve Board Makes Annual

10 congTess today tne members of
the federal reserve board class the re
serve act as one of the most bene
ficial pieces of legislation ever en

suggestions for further legislation on
the subject
In part the report Is as follows:
A condition of remarkable ease has:
been the outstanding feature of thel
I money inaiset oi ine country during:
the first year of operation under the1
federal reserve act. Whatever other
causes may have contributed to this
result, much of it Is aue to the sta-!
billty established and-tn feeling of
security inspired, by the new bunking1
system; so much of It, indeed, as to
afford s striking vindication of the)
wisdom of the law and tne efflcienct :
of the agencies of Its administration!
even in advance of the ruller devel-l
opment of their activities even In ad-1
vance of the fuller development of
their activities. The test ol B bank-i
ing and financial system is its oper-
ation. and Its administration should1
constantly he subjected to this test. I

The following are some of the pro-i
visions of the law affecting the col

WASHINGTON, Feb. 14. Wilson
and Lansing are In perfect accord
over the policy in the Teutonic plans
to make unwarned attacks on armed

America .takes the eGrman view, the

administration would refuse pass
ports to passengers sailing on armed
ships.
