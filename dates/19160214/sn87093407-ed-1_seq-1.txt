A Bone-Head Report
rPO THE fair-minded, unprejudiced voter, the re
port of the Municipal league committee on can
didates must appear as a colossal joke.
This is particularly apparent in the summary
of the candidacies for corporation counsel.
The committee reports the record of H. H.
Guie in the legislature as "satisfactory." In the
same breath it reports the record of Thomas F.
Murphine as "good," and also takes a dig at him.
Guie's and Murphine's votes on every import
ant measure in the legislature were directly op
posed to each other.
Murphine voted as an independent. Guie
voted with the "machine."
A glance at the 1 ( >1S legislative record must
convince even t|ie blindest of blind that if Guie's
record is "satisfactory," Murphine's was not, and
il Murphine's is "good," Guie's is "bad."
Here are the votes on the 15 most important
measures in the I'M.S session:
No. Bill— Ita purpoie. Murphine. Gule.
H. B. 34—To repeal women's elftt-hour law No Yea
H. B. 41—To repeal eight hour IfW on public work No Yea
8. B. Jol—Certificate of necesalt', aimed against
public ownerahlp No Yea
H. B. 120— To kill Initiative and referendum .... No Yes
H. B. 178—To detroy recall No Yes

8. B. —Anti-plcketing bill No Yea

Whsthsr the death of tha

"I do not want tiie prosecution
