Delegate Kuhio, who ii persistently
reported as .intending to leave Wash
ington within a few days and return
to Hawaii, proposes that George Mc
Klnley McClellan, his former secre
tary, be engaged to assist In looking
after Hawaiian legislation at the capl-
tai. ..-i - -
The proposal came last week 'in a
cablegram to the Chamber of Com
merce, informing the chamber of the
figure at which if r. McClellan. who is
an attorney and resided in Honolulu
, a number of years, could be secured.
The tentative offer of Attorney Mc
Clellan't services is tinder advisement
by officers of the chamber, it was
learned today."
Though nothing has been made pub
lie of Kuhlo's cablegram, the fact of
Its being received and naming; a fig
ure for McClellan services was con-
.firmed by President Waldron and Sec
retary Brown this morning. The flg
,ure waa not given out.
A factor which Is entering to some
extent into the situation is the plan
of the territorial administration to
send Superintendent of Public Works
Charles R,-Forbes to Washington to
work on Hawaiian legislation for two
months or so. . .' -
Mr. Forbes, who recently returned
' from the capital, where he accom
plished a rood deal in a short time,

Thirk Forbes Would Ee Effective.
V Llle Forbes would go for the ter
ritorial administration and not for. the
Chamber of Commerce, several mein
bers of the chamber are known to feel
that If he were a the job" there It
xnitt not be advisable to employ At
torney McClellan. It is pointed out
that Forbes baa been recently at
Washington was active and effective J
there, that he Is a Democrat and
. hencs a member of the dominant par;
ty. end: that he would go with the
authorization and official sanction of
the territory and the acquiescence of
the Interior department, thus, giving
'him several levers to use In expedit
Inz Hawaiian legislation.
-I want to go where I can jlo the
moEt service, said ' Superintendent
Fortes totfay when asked if he were
coin z to Washington. "As to a wash

priation for the west breakwater at
Kahulul, to speak on behalf of the
militia pay bill, Hawaii defense mat
ters, and land matters.
"I would go to.be of what assist
ance to 'the delegate is possible, to
put matters before him, and let him
direct my procedure.''
Attorney McClellan for a number of
years was secretary to tne ceiegaie
and also represented the commercial
bodies of Honolulu at that time the
Chamber of Commerce and the Mer
chants Association under a salary
arrangement In which each shared.
He also was paid by the Sugar Plant
ers' Association. : He Is credited with
having don a great deal for Hawaii
through V a&hlngton channels. When
the arrangement ended; about four
years ago, Mr. McClellan removed to
Seattle, where he has been since, en
gaged in law practise. He rsnow In
Washington, It la stated, and ready to
take hold at once, in case the chamber
' should decide to secure his service.
It was considered today that if
" Forbes should go to the capital, the
chamber would hardly close with Mc
Clellan; feeling that Hawaii would be
. sufficiently represented.
