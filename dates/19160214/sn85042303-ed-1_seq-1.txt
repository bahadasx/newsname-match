PRESIDENT HILL OF WESTERN
ASSOCIATION SAYS FIRST VA
CAN CY IN HIS CIRCUIT COMES
TO ARDMORE.
While denying that his hurried visit
to Ardmore Saturday had anything to
do with tin' capital of Carter county
becoming a member of the Western
association, President V. P. Hill an
nounced Saturday midnight while in
Oklahoma City after the aforesaid
visit, that Ardmore was an app'.'cant
for the first vacancy which occurs.
"It was a forlorn hope to hold out
to p 'ople as eager for organized base
ball as those business men down at
Ardmore," said President Hill, "but
I promised to ask the league to con
sider their application in case there
is a vacancy. I say forlorn, not be
cause I do not believe they would
be voted In unanimously, for that city
is ripe and admirably located for a
Western association berth, hut I can't
see where there is to be a vacancy
anywhere near soon."
"Why, do you know," he continued,
"they are so hungry for baseball
down ther they would go to almost
any extreme to get back in the game
again. While I went down there on
other bilsine:
about all I heard was
baseball. When I got ready to de
part Mayor Val Mullen said he would
throw me in jail for a vug, or perhaps
tie me to the top of a car of gasoline
and touch a match to it if I wouldn't
! eive them a chance at the first va
j cancy. He said thirty minutes after
I n fplofrmm w T-omiil-orl th;t a -nf!innv
is about to occur, Ardmore would
wire $3,000 ta fill it."
After relieving himself of this state,
ment President Hill insisted that it
he made plain that there was" no con-
! nection between the present unsettled
conditions at Tulsa and Muskogee and
the Ardmore affair,
"I Ion,t wanf things to be miscon-
sTued." he said. "In the first place
there is no doubt that both Tulsa and
Muskogee w ill shape up their affairs i

of general conversation. The

ileitis placed in the hand-
of a receiver without a heating, and
an attorney, in discu-suig the qiies-
tion, -aid as far hack as court opin
ions h:.e been recorded there is no
record of a .-imiiar kind in the law
books. What the outcome will be is
not known, but it is cr'ain that the
Crstal company w ill make a vigorous
fight to obtain possession of its prop-
ertv in the field, which is estimated
to be worth from a million to a mill
ion and a quarter.
Ledbeiter ,v Adams, attorneys for
the fn-tal company, will file a peti
tion with the court bv the middle of
the week a-king that the receiver be
discharged, and if Cue opinion of the
court is adverse to them after a hear
ing, the case will be appealed, and it
Is believed that the state supreme
court will give an immediate hearing
upon the (ttestion.
Mr. I.edbetter. In discussing the
question today, stated that the peti-
t on of A. T. McGhee was what would
be known under the Arkansas law,
which formerly prevailed here, as a
bill of discovery, asking the court
to conduct an inquiry to ascertain if
irregularities in the management of
the enmpanv existed. The order of
the court, says Mr. I.edbetter, went
further than to appoint a receiver,
but also made the receiver a commis
sioner and clothing him with Judicial
powers. For the reason that the or
der of the court seems to be some
what out of the ordinary, and for the
reason that it will be of much interest
to oil men, and especially to attorneys
who practice for the oil men. The
Ardmoreite is publishing the full text
of the order today.
II. T. Ilarreld, who has been en
gaged in keeping th" books for the
Crystal company, has been worried by
the petition, which charged a discrep
ancy of $7,000. This discrepancy ex
isted in .supplies in the field, and not
in the cash account. With two ex
ceptions, the audit of the books show
ed them to be in perfect condition as
to the cash account. One of these
instances was where the stub of a
check did set out. exactly the same
amount, which was a clerical error,
and the other instance was where a
member of the company made a small
di posit in th' hank w hich was not
fi ported to the bookkeeper. The.se
errors are not complained of, they
Were inconsequential as to amounts,
ami are such as occur in all books.
I' is certain that the case will be
watched with much interest, for two
reasons, first from the amount of
property involved and second, from
the unusual ruling of th" court.
The case had been tried and a
receiver appointed and qualified be
fore the members of the company
knew of if.
Following is the full text of the
judgment of the court:

Their mission in this section was
lo look oer ,-ome property between

wonh ihat is available for a s'ali
farm for working convicts, ami they
took options on l.L'00 acres.
It is the dec ire of the stale board
lo secure at least H.Oiio acres for this
purpose, but they believe that they
can easily secure the other SuO acres
in addition to that on which they hi
ready have options. II is. Understood
that there has already developed some
Opposition to local ing tlie farm in

Ihat no serious objections will be
found w hen a I borough investigation
of the case is made.
Mr. Aydelolte stated that whenever
ho has business in this section of
the state, he always makes it a point
to go by way of McAlester, as he

SUNDAY HIT
PIONEER CITIZEN WHO HAS BEEN
IN FAILING HEALTH, WAS ON
HIS WAY HOME FROM SOUTH
TEXAS WHfi END CAME.
Dr. C McCoy who for a number ot
years has been lu poor health, died on
the northbound Santa Fe train twelve
miles north of Fort Worth last night
while en route from Sau Antonio to
Ids home lu re.
The remains wore brought to this
city and taken to the undertaking es
tubishmeiit of Hi ow n and llridgmati
and prepared for buriul.
Dr. Henry of this city was notified
and had all arrangements made when
Ihe train arrived. Witli him, when the
end came, was his wile und brother
who have been with him for some time,
in South Texas points lu hopes of re
gaining his health.
Some time ago Dr. McCoy left thii
city hoiing that the balmy air of
South Texas would be beneficial to
him, but letters received from time
to time did not contain very cheerful
news, and finally, at his own sugges
tion, it was decided to return home
to await the end which the doctor saw
was inevitable. The end came before
he had finished his journey, and to
morrow, Tuesday afternoon at two
o'clock, the funeral services will be
conducted from the family residence
in northwest Ardmore, by Hev. C. C.
Width, followed by interment in Uose
ilill cemetery.
Iieside his w ile deceased is survived
by the following children who will be
here to attend the funeral: Mrs.
Lena Fielder, Ardmore; Mrs. C. A. Bil
bo, Caddo; Mrs. Ernest Howe, Electra.
Texas; Miss Ilessie .McCoy, Ft. Worth;
D. McCoy, Ft. Worth: Dr. J. II. Mc
Coy, Tahoka, Tex; Henry McCoy, Mc
Alester. And the following brothers
and sisters are left to mourn his loss.
T. W. McCoy, Wynnewood; Mrs. John
Wilder, Wynnewood; Dr. H. C. .McCoy,
Fort Worth. Dr. C. II. .McCoy, Tort
Lavacca. Texas; A. II. and D. McCy,
Caddo. Okla.; Miss Ella Frazier, Ard
more. Miss Lizzie McCoy, McAlester.
Dr. .McCoy was 71 years of age at
the time of his death. He came to Ard
more from Texas 26 years ago, and
has been a most valuable citizen to
this entire section of the state. He
never turned a deaf ear to one in dis
tress and his friends and neighbors at
test to his many sterling qualities. He
was active In the early development
of Ardmore and was a large property
owner. The entire city was shocked
to learn this morning of his death and
extends sympathy to the stricken fami
ly in their hour of bereavement.
