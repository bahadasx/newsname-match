WASHINGTON, D. C.. Feb. 14.?
t Resident Wilson today formally gave
his consent that his name be used as
Ma .candidate for renominatlon. In a
letter to the Secretary ot the state of
' Ohio, the President states that he Is
: unwilling to enter a contest for the
?renominatlon. but is ready to permit
X thp use of his name in the coming
primary in order that the Democrats
ot Ohio might make known their

i- The President made known his po

Ohio primary law. which requires can
didates for delegate to the party con
tention to make known their . first
and second choices before February
;26;r;and also requires that the candi
date for delegate have the' consent
of the choices to make use of their
names.
p The President was formally notified
Jot; the requirements ot the law last
.week, and today he wrote to Charles
[Hugh Hlldebrant, Secretary of the
state of Ohio as follows:
am enclosing to you a letter, the
[occasion "of which I dare say, will be
quitrtM)f|guf;';$!tiends, I11 Ohio have

The President takes the position
Kthat the voters will have to determine

Candidate.
In ;a letter written to A. Mitchell
KPalmer. then a representative trom
Pennsylvania before his inauguration,
?SOB;} Wilson made it plain that ho
would only be a candidate again if the
Democratic voters desired it. Politt
Scalfadvisers and friends of the Pres
ident have taken for granted for
months that he would be the nominee
of his party and have made their
jgplans accordingly. The National com
mittee has prepared all the campaign
Smaterial with the Idea that he would
Sgbejthe party candidate.

HIGHEST WATER OF
YEAR IS PROMISED
Now Twenty Feet And All
the Tributaries Are on
a Rise.
The sun shining all day today and
warmer weather promised for tomor
row, would seem to Indicate that Fair
mont Is to have more high water. The
streams entering the Monongahcia riv
er are already on a rapid rise, the
Monongahela itself being 22 feet deep,
or six feet above the average crest.
With the hills hereabouts covered
with snow,- which 'melting will neces
sarily cause tie river. to pass, the
flo<Hl-tlde,s,which is 25 feet, it seems
thai the highest water of tho season
will be here within the next few days.
The West Pork river from Weston
and Clarksburg Is rising rapidly, und
tho Tygarts Valley river from Graf
ton begins to show signs of turbu-'
lenco at the Junction at Johutown.
The ravlno under the Coal Run j
bridge looks as though it may bo flood
ed in a few hours at the present in
crease par hour. BufTalo Creek is
bringing debris and stumps to tho
river and is otherwise showing signs
of flooding Its hank.
No damage I, reported from the
towns above here in the way of high
water stopping the pumps, but a few
feet more and Weston and Grafton
water works and electric lights will
be out of commission.
Constable Arrests
Booze Filled Trunk
Friday night Sheriff Conaway re
ceived Information that a certain
trunk which was being shipped Into
Monongah was more than likely a li
quor container. He sent Constable
Harry Connors to Monongah to catch
the receiver of the trunk and bring
both the man and trunk here.
Connors waited at Monongah for
two days, expecting to catch tho man,
but the consignee must have been tip
ped ofT, for he did not appear. Wf.ea
It became dark Saturday evening Con- i
nors brought the trunk here. When !
opened in the office of the prosecuting
attorney, it contained 21 quarts of
whiskey.
The whiskey was placed in the base
ment of the court house, where it will
remain until Confiscation day, a day
that comes about every three months.

and forty minutes late. Train No.
50 due at 9:45 from Pittsburgh also,
was one hour and 30 minutes late. No.
3 from New York due here at 10:03
this morning was one hour late. AJ1
these delays /were due to the sudden
fall ln temperaturo, which had~a bad
effect on the rails and. also on the
rocks and dirt in cuts along the lines.
In several places along the road a
fall of 70 degrees in 24 hours was ex
perienced thereby contracting the rails
to such an. extent that breaks and
twists were met with at many sta
tions.
The traction company had trouble
yesterday- morning with bad rails on
account of tho weather. The Loop
Park car line was delayed one hour
on account of one of the cars being
derailed at Edgemont. This, however,
was the only delay suffered by that
company.
Tho steam roads yesterday were
more or less cripplcd temporarily all
along the line. The blizzard which hit
the Eastern States, having delayed
most of the main line trains on the
Baltimore & Ohio, the connecting
trains which run through Fairmont
were a little late.
Tho Monongahela railroad's New
York Central train duo hare at 9:35
Saturday night was one hour and thir
