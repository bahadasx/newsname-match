PRESIDENT ALLOWS
USE OF HIS NAME
Notifies Ohio Secretary of
State of Candidacy for
Renomination.
FRIENDS SAY HIS ACT
CLARIFIES SITUATION
National Committee Now Able to
Work on Assumption He Will
Be Party's Choice.
President Wilson today formally
gave his consent that his
name be nsed as a candidate for
renomination.
In a letter to the secretary of
state of Ohio the President stated
that lie was unwilling to enter a
contest for the nomination, but
was ready to permit the use of
his name in the coming primary
in order that the democrats of
Ohio might make known their
preference.
Complies With Ohio Law.
The President made known his position
in order to comply with tjje Ohio
pritnary law, which requires candidates
for delegates to the party conventions
to make known their first and
second choices before February 25, and
also requires that the candidates for delegates
have the consent of their choices
to make use of their names.
The President was formally notified
of the requirements of the law last
week, and today he wrote Charles Q.
Hildebrant, secretary of state of Ohio,
as follows:
"I am inclosing to you a letter the
occasion of which. I dare say, will be
quite obvious. Friends in Ohio have
called my attention to section 4954 of
the general code of Ohio as amended
in 1914 with regards to primary elections.
and have requested that I indicate
my willingness to have my name
used.
"I accordingly take the liberty of
sending you the inclosed letter as formal
permission under the statute."
The President's Letter.
The letter the President inclosed was
as follows:
"While I am entirely unwilling to enter
into any contest for the presidential
nomination of the democratic
party. I am willing to permit the tiae
>f my name, that the democrats in Dhio
may make known their preference
in regard to that nomination.
"In order, therefore, to satisfy the
technical requirements of the statutes
uf the state of Ohio, I hereby consent
to the use of my name as a candidate
for the presidency by any candidate
who seeks to be elected a d.elegate to
the national democratic convention
which is to assemble in June."
This was the first time the President
has consented formally to have his
name used 'In connection with the
nomination. His name has been placed
iru |si nil At y oaiiwtB iij several stales,^
however, through the activities of
friend$.
Voters Hust Determine.
The President takes the position that
the voters will have to determine
whether he will make the race for the
presidency in 1916 as the democratic
candidate. In a letter written to A.
Mitchell Palmar, then a representative
from Pennsylvania, before his inauguration,
Mr. Wilson made it plain that
he would only be a candidate again if
the democratic voters desired it.
Political advisers and friends of the
President have taken for granted for
months that he would be the nominee
of his party, ami have made their plans
accordingly. i ne national democratic
committee has prepared all its campaign
material with the idea that he
would be the party candidate.
The formal announcement today is
expected by democratic leaders to
clarify the political situation throughout
the country. Supporters of the
President, they said today, now would
be able to work for him more openly.

President Silent as to New
War Head Upon Return
From River Trip.
SWITCH IN THE CABINET
STILL IS PROBLEMATICAL
Many Names Submitted for Assistant
Secretaryship?Court of
Claims Berth Considered.
President Wilson returned to
Washington from his Potomac
river and Chesapeake bay trip
this morning, reaching the White
Mouse from the navy yard shortly
after 9 o'clock. The presidential
yacht Mayflower steamed
slowly up- the river last night,
having left Old Point at 2 o'clock
yesterday afternoon.
Going: to his offices at 30 o'clock, the
President started in on an active day,
his list of callers being: a large one, although
no important conferences were
scheduled.
No hint came from any direction as to
the selection of a_Secretary of War,
friends of candidates being doubtful
about presenting names to the President
Whpn thp President made ud his
original cabinet he practically announced
that he wanted no suggestions
on-the subject unless solicited by him.
This attitude has kept mai\y people
away from the White House and prevented
the writing of letters carrying
recommendations. Representative Sabath
of Chicago, departed from the
rule; however, by today personally urging
upon the President the name of
Carter Harrison, former mayor of Chicago,
for the vacancy.
Cabinet Switch Problematical.
There was no way of ascertaining
today whether the President intends
to make a switch in his own cabinet
to fill the war portfolio, but for some
reason the name of David F. Houston,
Secretary of Agriculture, continues to
stay in front in a promising; sort of
way. Mr. Houston, it is claimed by
close friends of his in the cabinet, has
been a forceful member of the President's
official coterie of advisers. He
has kept out of the limelight of publicity
to a large degree, but has done

Urged for Court of Claims.
The name of Representative Finis J.
Garrett of the ninth Tennessee district
was presented to the President today
for the vacancy in the Court of Claims
to be made by the retirement of Judge

senator-elect from Tennessee, saw the
President, stating that Mr. Garrett
knew nothing of the visit, but that he
would make an excellent judge of the
court. Representative Garner of Texas
was another caller who also urged
Mr. Garrett's name.

talion, D. C., on River Fiats
Near Fort Foote.
While out on a practice cruise yesterday
the U. S. S. Sylvia, training- ship
Df the Naval Battalion of the National
3uard of the District of Columbia, under
the command of Commander Joseph
K. Dempf, ran aground near Broad
::reek, just below Fort Foote. Efforts
jf the naval tug Choctaw from the
Washington navy yard last night to
pull the vessel off the flats failed, and
this afternoon at flood tide two naval
tugs, the Choctaw and Tecumseh, will
make further attempt to float the vesjel.
According to report received at the
vard, the naval militia vessel is vei^'
lard aground, and it probably will take
he combined efforts of the two powerful
tugs to pull her back into, deep
water.
In addition to Commander Dempf and
he enlisted personnel there were on
he vessel Harold L. Crawford, navigator;
Knsign Charles S. O'Connor, commanding
the 3d I>ivT8ion, and Hnsign
P. D. Johnston, commanding the 1st
Division.
Due to Return at 5 P.M.
The vessel was due to arrive at her
Jock at 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon,
according to plans which were announced
before she left. When the
;-oung men did not return to their
domes on time, calls began coming bv
telephone to the naval militia headquarters,
at the foot of Water and O
streets southwest, and the stream of
nquiries poured in all night and during
this morning.
Details as to the grounding of the
ship are meager, consisting principally
:>f the official reports and appeals for
iieip irom tnose aooaru ine vessel, jteports
received here indicated that the
vessel was well out of the channel.
Mid this, together with the very low
water in the river 011 account of the
strong northwest wind, will make the
job of floating the Sylvia a difficult
>ne.
Reports received at Washington last
light said that arrangements had been
nade to put the men ashore, but this
s doubted, as those known to have
seen on the vessels have not reported
it their homes. The entire complement
probably will be kept aboard the
Salvia until she arrives at her dock
his afternoon, if the naval tugs are
successful in their efforts to pull her
>fT.
Men May Be Short of Rations.
A8 the trip was only to be for one
lay, it is probable that arrangements
>nly were made to ration the men for
>ne meal, as is usual on such trips.
Whether the ship had enough on board
.0 carry her over two days is not
tnown, but she is said usually to carry
inly enough for the particular duty
>n which she starts out to perform.
The men prooaDiy are not suffering
my from the cold, as none of the re>orts
gave any indication that her
leating plant was out of commission,
>r that her boilers could not be used.
The tugs Choctaw and Tecumseh left
he Washington navy yard early this
norning wtth tows for Indian Head,
ind are under orders to reach the
Sylvia at high tide and make efforts
o pull her off the flats. Whether the
ibip is in any danger cannot be deermined
from the meager reports
vhich so far have come to Washingon.
The vessel is reported to have been

ill. a bill to clear up the records
if children who have been conicted
by the Juvenile Court and a
nitior public utility bill were
assed.
The recorder of deeds and the regls;r
of wills bills contained the imporint
provisions that residents of the
istrict of Columbia must be appoint i
to these positions. The recorder of
eeds is to be appointed by the Comlissioners
and the register of wills by
le District Supreme Court.
After these five bills had been passed
hairman Johnson called up the bill to
mend the present act on which the
uvenile Court is founded, providing
>r fundamental changes in that court,
his was merely parliamentary stratify
on his part in order to get the bill
efore the House. The three hours of
eneral debate which followed his
ringing up the bill were used for "
eneral discussions on other topics be>re
Congress. There will be no vote
n the Juvenile Court bill today. It is
elieved.

lw8 relating: to juveniles, have judgtents
or conviction of crime entered
gainst them in the present Juvenile
ourt and are thereby disualified from
iry duty, from holding office, or from
itering the public service. These chilren
should be emancipated from these
isabilities; the stigma should no long*
- rest upon them; the nation has
othing to lose and everything to gain.
"This bill, and a general bill for the
'organization of the Juvenile Court
>on modern and humane lines, reported
V* the committee on the District of
