be quite obvious. Friends in Ohio
have called my attention to section
4934 of the general code of Ohio as

ed that I Indicate my willingness to
have my name used. Accordingly, I

"Hon Charles HUdebrand,
Secretary of State,
Columbus, Ohio.

unwilling; to enter Into any contest
for the presidential nomination of
the democratic party, I am willing
to permit the use of my name so that
democrats in Ohio may make known
their preference in regard to that
nomination. In order, therefore, to
satisfy the technical requirements ot
the statute, I hereby consent to the
uso of my name as candidate for the
presidency by any candidate who
seeks to be a delegate to the demo
cratic national convention.
"Respectfully yours,
"(Signed)

PRESIDENT AIID SECRETARY DP STATE
it f
Washington, Feb. 14. President
WllHon and Secretary of State Lans
ing are In perfect accord over their
policy in the matter ot the Teutonic
plans to make unwarned attacka on
armed merchant vessels, it was learn
ed today. The president considers
that Issues may arise from the pro
posals of Germany and Austria
fraught with possibilities aa grave, if
not more grave, than any that have
confronted the nation since tho war
started,
The attitude ot the government to
ward the Teutonic announcement has
not been fully determined.
The administration has learned
that Berlin Is sending here photo
graphed copies ot British Instructions
to vessels to "ratn or run" when
sighting submarines. Upon these or
ders the central powers hold that
they are Justified In their new course.
The German note, announcing the
new policy operative after February
29, doea not distinguish hotween pas
senger and freight merchant ships,
and declared that both would be sunk
without warning if they are armed.
The Austrian announcement has
also reached here and will be turned
over to President Wilson with the
Berlin notice. Both will bo made
public tomorrow,
rt is admitted that if this govern
ment takes the German view the
state department must goibeyond the
mere restriction of, entry of such
armod ships Into American ports.

marine sank a French warship.
She had been doing patrol duty off
the Syrian coast .

vessel, carried a crew of 375 and an

lean citizens to keep off such vessels
would not relieve the government of

garded the warning. , Probably the
administration must refuse to grant
passports to citizens desiring to travel
on armed ships.
The allies' replies to Lansing's pro
posals for disarming merchantmen
are expected to arrive In a day or
two.
Should a crisis develop over the
situation, lt is expected to arise very
soon, as the new rules go Into effect
next month.

R. H. ' Gillilandr representing the
department of the interior, waa in
the city Saturday investigating the
cutting of wood from the O. ft C.
granted lands, the status ot which is
now before congress. Mr. Gilllland
said that under the injunction recent
ly issued by Judge Wolverton of the
federal court, the removal of timber
or any other thing of value from the
lands of the grant was absolutely
prohibited, and his trip through the
district waa to see that the injunction
was being observed. He said that re
ports of the cutting of wood from the
lands in this vicinity had come to the
department, and that a part of his
duty would be to see that this was
discontinued. A former agent ot the
department,. . before the order of
Judge Wolverton, had made no ob
jection to the removal of wood from
the lands so nothing but brush and
down timber was taken, but Mr. Gilll
land was of the . opinion that the
Wolverton injunction would cover
this also, so to keep from being in
contempt of court woodcutters would
have to cease their operations.
