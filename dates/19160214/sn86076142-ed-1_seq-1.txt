Attorney Frank Pitt man, who re
turned with his family several days
ago from an extended visit to Hono
lulu and to coast points, said to a
Uonanza Interviewer:
"We sailed from San Francisco on
the 6th of October. The sea was very
calm and the voyage would have
proven a very pleasant one had It
not been for the extreme heat which
we encountered after the third day
out. We arrived in Honolulu on the
12th of October. I haci heard so much
of the beauties of Honolulu, of Its

handsome public buildings and magni
ficent scenery that I was prepared
to see a country that deserved Its
name, paradise of the Pacific, a pluce
where I could make my future home.
