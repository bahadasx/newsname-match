Five District bills were quickly
passed by the House,' today and
extended debate begun on a sixth
measure, which probably will pass
before adjournment
The House devoted itself today
to District business for the first
time this session, and there was
little of the debate which has here
tofore caused business to drag on
so-called District days. The com
mittee bills were accepted with
out question, and the five
measures were disposed of in less
than an hour.
An important sidelight on the
legislation approved today was the
fact that tho House approved of
.the contention that District officers
should he residents of the Rational
Capital. t v
FIY&.??t LLS PASSED--
The "ve tills approved by the House,
without a dissenting vote, are as tal

jnent was reached that there should bo,
threo hours of general debate on the
bill amending the laws relative to tho
Juvenile Court -and broadening the
scope of the worlc of that institution.
Tinder the tenernl debate rule a menv
ber may talk on any subject, and Con

lonir sucerh In favor of protective du
ties on Imported dyestufts. A vote on
the Juvcnllo Court bill will como late
thin afternoon, unless tno time ror ae

Tho Juvrnllo Court bill Is a moasuro
prepared by Bernard Flexner. of Chi
cago; Miss Julia aLthrop, William, W.
Baldwin, and others who. are Interested
in tho nroposal' to put tho Juvenile
Court hero "upon a broad and humane
theory diametrically opposed to the
present law, which would establish a
' ludlclal guardianship over the child to
protect and help It. and not to punls.t
and stigmatize It,"
There was practically no debate on
any of the District bills passed bv tho
House today. Mlnorltv Leader Mann
asked Clialrman Den Johnson If the
President approved tho nronosal to have

ciency bill conference report
Senator Newlands proceeded vigorous
ly to attack the proposition to construct
the slant on the site south of tne new
Bureasj of Engraving and Printing
building, which, waa chosen by the
Treasury Department. s.
Senator MarUn defended the action of
the Treasury aa wise.
The conferees on the urgent deficiency
but struck out the proviso which would
havo blocked construction of the power
plant on the site chosen. This was done
last week. It Congress approves the
action of tho conferees, the building will
go ahead on, the site which the Trens
uryhas chosen.
ewlands IJrges Rejection.
In accordance with the notice ho gave
Saturday when he strongly objected to
the proposed "debasing" of the beauty
of of the Capital of the Nation. Senator
Newlands spoke at length, and urged
the Senate to turn down the action of
the conferees. '
To explain the sltuaUon more fully to
Senators, Senator Newlands had placed
on the desk of every Senator a Urge
slxed 'lithograph showing the Washing
ton of the future. enUtted "The Ultimate

Aa a preliminary. Senator G-alllnger
presented the tetter of the Washington
Architectural Club, made public today,
favoring the plant on the sits chosen by
the Treasury.
This led Senator Newlands to re
mark that the ruembers of this organ

the office of the supervising architect
of the Treasury. Naturally, he said,
they would favor the Treasury plan.
Benatqr Newlands then argued at
length against locating the power

LONDON. Fob. 14. Belief that Rou

side of the allies Is strengthened today by
official dispatches from Paris, reporting
Roumanian mobilisation comoleto.
Paris also reported that the construc
tion of Roumanian works along the
Danubo and In the Carpathians to guard
against possible Invasions by the. Bui
Bars and Austro-Hungarlans, have been
finished. Work .on these .fortifications,
according to recent Rome reports,' has
been In Progress throughout tho winter.
Thus far no word has reached Lon
don of an order for tho mobilization of
the entire Roumanian army. The Paris
statement that mobilisation has heen
completed Is assumed to refer io the
reecnt, deeroo mobilizing other forces of
the Roumanian army and placing nine

With oftldats of the SUte Department
Inclined to agree witn tne Ausiro-uer-tnan
contention, and "With President
Wilson1 sorlously considering the Issu
ance of new Instructions to American
port authorities prohibiting them from
granting the usual harbor privileges to
armed merchant ship's, a crisis Is Im
pending between the relations of the
United States and tho entente powers.
Reprisals Threatened.
According to persons In close touch
with the Dritlsh and French embassies,
such action by the United States Is ier
tatn to lead to retaliatory measures on
the part of the allies. Talk of trade re
prlsats Is being freely heard In these
quarters. There Is fear expressed tht
out of the bitterness which the situa
tion will give rise to. more serious con
sequences may follow.
At tho Btato .Department today It Is
nmrtlrnllv admitted that If the United
States takes theOerman view, the depart-
ment will havo to ko oeyono a mere re
striction of harbor facilities for armed
merchant ships and a warning to Ameri
cans to keeo off such vessels. It Is re
garded as practically certain by depart
ment officials that the department's
representatives In' the United States and
abroad .would be instructed to refuse
.1,4.4a trt AmHAn rlAiilrlnic to
travel on armed ships.
powers to the proposals of becretary of
titate Lansing for the 'disarmament of
their merchant vessels are expected to
reach the department within the uext
day or two. Owing, to tho limited tlmo
remaining before March 1. the Ameri
can attitude will be made known this
week.
Threats Minimized.
State Department officials are Inclined
to minimize the threats of reprisals.
They declare that it would be foolhardy
for the allies, dependent aa they are on
American munitions of war. to attemnt
to cripple the general foreign trade of
the united states oy wunnoiaing tne
use of their merchant ships. Such at
timnt thev indicate, mlsht be fallowed
by an embargo on the shipment of war
supplies.
In British quarters it is admitted that
some embarrassment might be occa
sioned by the stoppage of war ship
ments, but attention Is called to the fact
that Canada Is rapidly developing as a
source of supply, and that already her
wheat is ample to supply the needs of
Great Britain.
On the other hand. It Is pointed out,
a sudden cessation of the trafflo in mu
nitions would result disastrously for the
United States, and might even lead to
a panic.
