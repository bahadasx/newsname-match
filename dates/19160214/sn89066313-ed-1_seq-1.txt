'0 CI1RISTIIX COUNTRY TODAY"
So Sajs Sirs. II. u. Montgomery in a
'lalk ut Stephens College.
"There is no Christian country to
day," said Mrs Helen B. Montgomery
jes'erdaj morning to those assembled
in the Stephens College Auditorium to
hear her interpretation of the petition
"Th) Kingdom Come," included in the
Lord's Pra) er. "America Is not a I
Christian nation; It Is only partially
so. It Is more Influenced by Christian
it) than any other nation and it is the
dut) of America as the most Christian
countrv to help make 'Thy Kingdom
Come' upon the entire earth."
At present, according to Mrs. Mont
gomery, the Christians of the world
are not doing enough to spread their
religion. Only thirty persons out of
every hundred have heard that there
was such a being as Christ. The prob
lem, according to Mrs. Montgomery-p is
one of extensive foreign missionary
work and to doubt the value of for
eign missionary work is to be un
christian, for the teaching of Christ
was forcefully that of spreading the
gospel.
Mrs Montgomery concluded her talk
b pointing out the dangers likely to
result from unchristian manifestations
in the world's social, political and ec
onomic institutions, and by emphasiz
ing the importance of spreading the
giMicl to foreign lands. "America
h s to Christianize tha world or the
voi Id will heathenize America," con
cluded Mrs. Montgomery.

rHOUGHTS FROM SERiMONS

Dr. W. N. l.hv.ing, Piesbvterian
Church (morning) Of all pnrtons
the discouraged man is the one mostl)
likely to endanger his moril and spir
itual welfare Tis then that the hand
tightens ?bout the puiso-stnngs, tiie
lips close themselves against wrong,
the heart loses its concern for the sor
rows and tragedies of others and the
mind forgets pity and justice, the two
great saviors of societ). Often, too

Dr. W. w. Ehvamr, Presbvtenan
Church (everting) Jesus welcomed
the man of real flesh and blood and
hated mediocrity. It is better for a
man to be a fanatic than to be luke
warm in his religious duties. The
trouble with our churches toda) is
that they are content to drift with the
people and are afraid to take chances
by showing enthusiasm which would
attract attention.
