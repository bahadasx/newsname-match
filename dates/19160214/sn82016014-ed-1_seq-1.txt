Owint? to the rigid regulations im

along the border with Canadian circu

of reports from across the river for
fear of an order prohibiting their en

"Canadian papers were ordered today
to print nothing regarding troop
movements and American papers on
the border were informed that if such
reports were published the papers
would be confiscated in Canada.

Comes Within Pale of the Su
preme Court Decision.
All of Which Probably Means a
Higher Tax Rate.
Loss of the oil inspection case in the
state supreme court, may mean that
Kansas will be compelled to suffer
further losses from inspection reve
nues and th.it the state may also face
another increase in tax levies. Esti
mates prepared by persona in touch
with oil inspection conditions indicate
that Kansas will lose approximately a
quarter o a million dollars from the
oil fees before the legislature can pro
vide a new law.
Greed ;n the part of the state ad
ministration caused the state to lose
the $j0,0JU in revenues which nre
lost under the court decision declar
ing the old inspection act a revenue
producing measure. Governor Capper
refused to approve the compromise by
the legislature which would have
meant about $72,000 in revenues to
the state and would have been paid
by the oil companies without protest.
The state wanted all or nothing1. Un
der the court decision it gets nothing.
Further, it must spend ? 2 8, 200 from

For several years the oil companies
have complained bitterly concerning
the fees for oil and gasoline inspec

der the Stubbs rule, an army of in
spectors were provided and they drew
the inspection money in salaries and
olocked an attempt to upset the law.
In 1913 the old law was amended and
five inspectors did the work of 135

Premier Briand and Cardinal Merrier

the seat of the French art school of

Valentine Day
and Leap Year,
'Tis To Beware!
St. Valentine's Day is here and it's
Leap year. Look out, Topeka!
To little Johnny and Margaret
across the aisle, it is an auspicious
day. An ea.rle-eyed teacher might de
tect the passage of an ordinary note
between those two desks. But to have
a flower bedecked fussy printed dec
laration of Valentine's greeting inter
cepted. Horrible! horrible, certainly
not to be thought of for a moment.
A hard hearted, soulless spirit that
regulates the class room has banished
the old Valentine box that formerly
stood at the head of the school rooms
each February 14. But the spirit of
the day (till haunts young Jawhn and
she will be a worthy Hawkshaw who
detects the cards in the books that
pass from desk to desk.
The origin of St. Valentine's day
dates ba?k so far in history that it Is
lost in the haze. It is believed to be
commemorative of two saints, both of
the same name.
Karly records show that its observ
ance in England, Scotland and
France in the fifteenth century car
ried with -t considerable more risk
thxn is the case now. It was then the
custom on Ihe eve of February 14, to
have the names of a select r.umber of
one sex put into a vessel by an equal
number of the other. Then everyone
drew a name, which for a year was
his or her Valentine. And during the
twelve months the persons were nom
inally engaged. Frequently. too.
th?se engagements held gooa and be
fore the year was out a number of
weddings attested the efficiency of the
scheme.
The custom has degenerated with
the centuri 3, however, and today is
almost unrecognizable excepting for
its observance in the public schools.
in the main, the person who sends
a Valentine today harbors in his soul
no tender thoughts of love. In 9i
cases ou: of every hundred, he nurses
a grudge. And his greeting is a beau
tiful work of art by "Bud' Fisher,
Goldberg or another artist of the
present school.
P'ederal postal regulations have in
a measure :imiteti the designs of Val
entine sender but a fairly effective
piece of work is still possible.

BLAST WRECKS PLANT;

Schenectady
T., Feb. 14. The
munition
plant of the General ijlec-
trie company was wrecked by a fire J
today. The blaze was finally extin
guished by the company's private fire
department and no report was made
to the city police or fire authorities.
Officials withheld all information
concerning the fire. The origin of the
fire is reported to have been a terrific
explosion ir. the boiler room.
The roof of the building has fallen
in and the walls have been declared
unsafe. The plant has been closely
guarded for some time and no one was
allowed to approach the munitions
building today.
Blast Wrecks Plant.
The burned building was a one
story structure of concrete and was
used for the manufacture of shell
casings. There were no explosive or
inflammable material in the building.
Says Oil Exploded.
"We do not attach any significance
to the fire." said George K. Emmons,
general manager. "It undoubtedly
was caused by spontaneous combus
tion, as much oil was used in the work
incident to the shell making."
Mr. Kmmons said the damage would
be repaired so that work could be re
sumed possibly tomorrow. When
news of the fire spread about the city
it caused much excitement as the blaze
was accompanied by several explo
sions. Mr. Emmons said the explo
sions probably were caused by the ig
nition of barrels of oil stored in the
building.

t waited tor the full effect of her re-
mark to soak in. Then:
"Who invited me ? Why, I liked

I come? Why shouldn't I stay? Have
we a fight here? We certainly think
so.
Merely because someone organ-
zed something else, doesn't give them
the right to dictate what shall be
done. I presume if one of the political
parties had organized In Kansas in
advance of any other party, that all
others should stay out .merely because
there was a political organization
here."
Here for Converts.
Alaybe you don't get th-2 full effect
of that. Miss Vernon wanted to
make herself quite clear. She wanted
it understood that the new organ
isation didn't come in search of vic
tims, it came to plead for converts.
"We didn't come to tell the women
of Kansas what to do or to help
them," said, the young women from
Delaware in her most soft and sooth
ing tones. "We came to ask Kansas
women to help us. Kansas women are
i a . , tVtni i,i , l,
tion, their assistance.
Possibly there was just the slightest
trace of a tear and burning resent
ment when Miss Vernon outlined her
mission in Kansas. But the war was
started. It was not the shrewd, clever
and resourceful little woman from
Delaware who was to run for cover.
Would there be a fight concerning
the organization in Kansas? Mis? Ver
non didn't know. Possibly there would
be a division of the women. Yet Miss
Vernon knew that something in the
constitution mentioned equal and in
Inalienable rights. Surely that pro
vision applied to the congressional
union. So the union has come to stay.
Here to Stay.
"We expect to organize in Kansas,"
continued Mips Vernon. "They can't
stop our meeting. Many Kansas wom
en are interested in our work. They
want a Kansas branch of the congres
sional union here. They want to or
ganize even with a Delaware inter
loper." Would the union withdraw from the
state? Miss Vernon had heard noth
ing of such plan. To the contrary, she
thought the organization was growing
and winning new converts.
Miss Vernon was asked if she had
seen the protest from seventy Kansas
women attacking the rights of the new
organization. She had. But she didn't
feel that it interfered with anyone's
rights. No change would be made in
the original plans. And thus the
Hard ing-Cnse-Johnston organization

a single name may go to sleep to

cussed by many of the visiting Ma
sons friendly and unfriendly to the
Topeka Shrine project.

Not Much Iovc.
For years Topeka hasn't had much
use for Leavenworth and Leavenworth
never did give a great many raps
about Topeka. Topeka has been more
or less reluctant in boosting Leaven
worth's favorite Shrine projects while
Leavenworth has up until the last year
carried things through to suit herself.
But with the election of L. M. Pen

began to take a hand in Abdallah'
affairs and it palls, more or less, upor.

that the recent trip to Seattle adver
tiued Topeka a great deal more than
Leavenworth. Then, at the recent
election an Atchison man became po
tentate and again Leavenworth was
foroed to take a back seat in com
parison to that ocoupied in past years.
One thing has brought on another

of mv name that the Democrats in
Ohio may make known their prefer
ence in regard to that nomination.
"In order, therefore, to satisfy the
technical reauirements of the statutes
! of the state of Ohio, f hereby consent
to the use of my name as a candidate
for the presidency by any candidate
who seeks to be elected a delegate to
the national Democratic convention
which is to assemble in June next."
This was the first time the president
has consented formally to have his
name used in connection with the
nomination. His name has been placed
on primary ballots in several states,
however, through the activities of
friends. The president takes the posi
tion that the voters will have to de
termine whether he will make the race
for the presidency in 1916 as the
Democratic candidate.
The formal announcement today is
expected by Democratic leaders to
clarify the political situation through- 1
: out the country. Supporters of the
president, they said, now would be
able to work for him more openly.
