Has Served to Bring Congress and the

Washington, Feb. 13. Secretary
Garrison's resignation last week haa
had far-reaching results upon con

leaders. When the excitement fol
lowing the unexpected development
had subsided, it was apparent that it
had clarified the existing atmosphere
with regard to two important issues,
national defense and Philippine inde
pendence, and had served also magical
ly to bring cqngress and the president
closer together than they had been
for many months.
As to national defense, the resigna
tion of the secretary finally sealed
the fate of his continental army plan,
which chairmen of both house and sen
ate military committees declared never
could have been accepted by congress.
Work began at once on preparation for
framing a plan of federalization of the
national euard to crease a reserve de
fensive force. Latent enthusiasm for
preparedness was aroused in scores of
influential members or botn orancnes
who had been opposed to the continen
tal army plan and who had been taking

programme. .o wtnese memDers nave
put their shoulders to the wheel and
there is a prospect that an army regu
lation bill will be perfected soon.
