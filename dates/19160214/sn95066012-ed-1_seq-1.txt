CLERGY PENSION PLAN
Biggest Single Enterprise in History
of Episcopal Church.
UurlinKton. Feb 10. Though Bis
hop A. C. A. Hall of the Vermont Epis
copal diocese was prevented by illness
this week from reading the announce
ment the church pension fund
scheme he authorized the statement
that the Vermont diocese is consider,
ing the plan. The statement read
this week by more than 40 bishops in
this country is as follows:
"The Episcopal church has deter
mined to undertake tho largest single
iJ enterprise in its history, namely, to in
stitute a system of pensions for its
retired clergy.
"Before entering upon this policy
the church did two things: (1) Made
a careful census of the salaries now
paid to clergymen, and (2) Had calcu
lations made by export actuaries of
the cost of maintaining a' system the
permanent success of which there
could be no doubt.
"The census of salaries, now com
pleted, shows the following .principal
facts:
"There are 4420 men in the active
service of the Episcopal church in tho
United States. Their average salary
is 11200 a year. This is not all cash,
but includes the value of a house,
when provided. Moro than 2500 of
these ministers, over one-half the
total number,, receive less than f 1500 i
a year. Only 237 Including., the ,iz&
Bishops-jeooiv $1000 or over. ,
'Mora aharV70(? men ere paid leas
than $1000 and many of theso !QQ; are
the older t K clergy,' witli Sery,; Iiaril
tasks. .rThiChVirch riowvlsvirjuajl
carrying . ojut -.scfhemA W.-Wtlretnent
at tho expense of itfplder'taea:.' . 'i
; "TheHe.eape.'Salarlesare pajd (a
clergymen, serving what Wvttprt s
aertefi to ie! IJje' tfchesf'chUrc.h ipnfin
bership' In .Atnertca.' These , rnQu faro
expected to have a good education,l.to
dress well, to livo and move among
people where rents aro high, keep
open houso, always appear cheerful,
and preserve their physical vigor.
They are men of devotion, who often
exercise leadership in their commun
ities, and who must support them
selves, their wives, and their children
on tho salaries paid them, with little
or no thought of outside interests.
"The ministers do not complain.
But the church itaelf must be efficient
Efficiency consists partly in being
Equipped to fight at the top-notch or
cnthustesai and vigor, '."The minister
cannot do this if, with all his 'sacri
fices, cheerfully made, while he la ac
tive, he has no assurance of a compe
tence in his old age.
"Railroad companies seek efficiency
and enthusiasm from tlieir men t
through promises of a pension. It is
in the broadest interest of society
that every church should do the same.
'The Episcopal church lias passed
the exact vital statistics of the whole
body of her clergy through tho labor
atory of the 'hest actuaries and has
adopted a pension system which U
modern and sound. ,
"It is a contributory system where
by upon the payment by ihe" parish
each year of an additional seven per
cont speaking . roughly of the' minis
ter's 'salary, he will "receive: on retir
ing at 68, a pension equal to one-half
his -average salary during his ! active
service At death, " his. widow and
minor children will receive, annual
revisions; if disabled in active, ser
vice, a pension follows. -' ' '. A . v
"Tlws In the full tide of actlve3 ser
vice be can throw himself into his
work with the completo abandonment
of an officer who knows that what
ever happens to him, his dear ones
will be cared for, and he, if living to
old ago. will go to his grave with dig
nity and self-respect.
. "In order to take care of those who
should be pensioned immediately, and"
to give the contributory plan time to
move permanently on its own wheels,
an initial sum of $5,000,000 is to bo
raised.
"To direct the task of obtaining this
reserve fund, Bishop Lawrence of
Massachusetts will, during 1916, sus
pend active work in his own diocese
and devote himself wholly to this
great enterprise
"The co-operation of leading llfo in
surance officers and business men has
boon obtained to establish the schom
Local committees will bo appointed
throughout the United States. To get
this splendid undertaking on its feet
will be tho supreme task of the Epis
copal church in 1916."
