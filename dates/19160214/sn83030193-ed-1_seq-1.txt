CITY CHAMBERLAIN
WHO WILL LEAVE HIS
OFFICE IN SPRING.
To Notify Mayor Formally
Soon, but Will Work for
City Until Spring.
City Chamborlaln Henry Ilruoro
will, within tho next day or two, ten
der his resignation to Mayor Mltchol.
The Mayor will accept It, through on
understanding he and the Chamber
lain reached some tlmo ago, but It
will not becoma effective until Into
In tho spring.
Mr. Hruero's reason for leaving his
important office In tho city adminis
tration Is that hu may accept an
executive office with tho American
Metal Company. Ho will not, how
ever, leave the City Government until
he hns completed a voluminous re
port, now In progress of uBsombly,
on tho work accomplished In tho last
two years in tho twcnty-olght de
partments under the Mayor and the
formulation of a definite working
programme for tho next two years'.
Every ossuranco was given by Mr.
Bruere this afternoon that his own
interests and not tho suggestion of
a dlffnrcnco botweon himself and the
Mayor had prompted him to resign
his oflice.
"For a long time I have consid
ered leaving the city government,"
he said, "and I havo been fortunate
In having hud several opportunities
offered mo to go Into business. In
that way I havo bocn able to select
the work I most preferred and this I
shall undnrtako lato in tho spring.
"Ilut 1 do not mean to cut myself
oft entirely from tho constructive
work I havo'boen permitted to do as
Chamberlain. I should, in fact, much
prefer to remain In oflice, but my own
Interests requlro that I resign. How
ever, I shall kIvo my Sundays ami
hollduys and any other eiaro time t.i
the city whenever my services ar"
needed. But I huvo no political as
pirations or Interests, and t nm not
so circumstanced financially that 1
can take the chances of political life .
And that's why I am leaving otllcc.
"For twttvo years I havo been n
gaged In Koclal worJ. tho Job of nty
Ohu'mberlam In I'ortaluly ftooial work
ot tho highest kind and I must think
o' the future uml whut the neM ten
