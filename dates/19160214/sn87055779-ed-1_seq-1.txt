Is Not Expected to Change
United States Stand That
Merchant Vessels Must
Not be Armed.

Practically All Atlantic Ships
Are Used in Carrying
Goods Necessary
For the Allies.
Infemntlonnl Nenn Servi;
WASHINGTON. Feh. 14. Threats
of a ship boycott by Great Britain
and her allies should this govern
ment rule that a r nurd merchantmen
shall be denied clearance papers
from American ports caused no con
cern at the state department. There
attention is confidently called to the
trade reports, which disclose that so
far as IJritish or French liners are
concerned and they are tho chief
freighters of the Atlantic the mani
fests filed at all ports of entry show
that the goods carried a such as
are absolutely necessary for the bel
ligerents. The British threat, it is
said, is looked upon as much of a
'duff and will not figure in the final
decision on the subject.
The hit; problem that the Fnited
States most solve, and which is com
pelling the attention of the president
and Sec y Irnsing, is the efTect that
the changing at this time of a deci
sion a'Tecting- international law will
b ave upon tho future interests of the
Fnited States.
Had this government insisted that
all merchant vessels be disarmed at
the outset of the war. it is conceded
that this action would have had a
material effect on the Teutonic sub
marine campaigns. To change now,
and deliberately revert-- an earlier
ruling, might b used by Great Brit
ain as an excuse for demanding
thanges in our commercial methods
and might even bet usod as an ex
cuse for the present commercial and
mail blockade.
Studio German Ruling.
Sec'y Lansing has carefully studied
the German announcement that on
March 1 the Teutonic submarines
will sink all armed vessels without
warning. He has drafted a tenta
tive communication outlining the po
sition of this government on the sub
j et. It flatly says that in.a-sniuch as
vessels can b armed only for de
fense against submarine attack,
these vessels take on the guise of
naval auxiliaries and should be
treated as such. He will discuss tho
matter with the president in the
near future and then, if the execu
tive approves, announcement of the
new policy will be communicated to
all of the belligere its.
Although the entente allies
protest shandy against the
ruling should it 1) made as
seems likelv. otfieials believe
will
new
now
that
thev will Im compelled to accept it.
The Fnited States holds the whip
hand. Its commerce with neutrals
cannot be nterfered with ina-smuch
as It Is being conducted in neutral
v esels or with vessels' operating
under American registry.
Should the British authorities en
deavor to curtail tho operation of
their shipping between the Fnited
States and British and French ports,
it will be ;hose nations that will
stiffor. as practically everything car
ried in that trade, is used for war
purpose.
BR
International New Service:
LONDON. Feb. 14. England will
reject proposals mad' by the Fnited
spates that merchant vessels be dis
armed. In taking this action Great
Brit. tin will have the backing of all
the entente powers. This ha been
determined by informal preliminary
conferences held by Kir Edward
Grey with representatives of tho al
lies in London, and formal affirma
tion of the decision will be made at
a great "war council to be held in
Faris in the near future.
The British government will rover
abandon the position that it has
taken that the sinking of merchant
vessels without warning even if the
ships attacked carry nuns for their
own defense, is contrary to the prin
ciples of civilized warfare.
The general impression among the
people of England and in Lmdon
ottb-ial circles is that the American
k'overnment intends to accept the ar
gument of Germany.
This Is certain to result in the de
velopment of tension, more or less
a ut between Lmdoti and Wash
ington. What the outcom of such
.i cuestion will be n one can fore
tell at present.

Record of Pupils Not What It
Should be, Says Supt.
Montg:mery.
Only S3 per cent of the total num
ber of school children In the public
schools were promoted at the end
of the semester that ended Jan. 21,
a record that Is not what it nhould
be, according to Supt. L. J. Mont
gomery. Out of a total enrollment
of 8.2S0 in all of the grades from
the kindergarten through the gram
mar school, there were G.&89 chil
dren who actually . belonged to tho
schools. Of this number 5,770 were
promoted to higher grades.
Of the 8.2SO children. 390 had
permanently withdrawn by the end
of the semester. The other children
were considered as not belonging to
.school, because they were out three
days. Enrollment in the high school
for the first emester was 1.02R,
practically the same as it was last
year. An increase of 485 Is shown
over last year's enrollment in the
grades.
Promotions Made.
During the semester 79 promo
tions were made. The advancements
were made when pupils showed that
they were sufficiently intelligent to go
into higher classes. The 2B grado
led in special promotions. 29 having
been made in all of these classes in
the city.
Following are tho promotion aver
ages for the various grades: IB. 77;
1A. 82; 2B, 88; 2A, 52; 3B. 85; "A,
83; 4B. 84; 4A. 82; 5B. 79; 5A. 81;
6B. S2; 6A, 89: 7B. 73; 7A, 79; 8B.
95; 8A, 94. These figures show that
the children of the 8B grade did the
best work and those of 7B the poor
est. The fact that both of the di
visions of the eighth grade were
higher than any other Is accounted
for in that the poorer students drop
out before they get to the eighth
grade. Averages in the high school
are even better than the eighth
grade for the same reason, accord
ing to Supt. Montgomery.
Of the total enrollment in the
grades, 8.280, 4,192 are boys and
4.008 are girls, showing that they
are about even. There are IIS
colored children in the ward schools
there being 53 toys and a like num
ber of girls.
Figures Are (J I von.
Following are figures showing tho
enrollment by grades for tho first
semester of this year: Kindergarten,
930; - hirst, 1.467; second. 1.1 48;
third. 1.074; fourth. 947; hfth, 917;
sixth. 717; teventh, 56S; eighth. 442;
vocational, 72; ungraded, 18. The
same semester of the preceding year
gave the following figures: Kintler-
frarten. Sf.O; first. 1,577; second,
1.099: third. 981; fourth. 928: fifth.
SGI; sixth, 668; seventh, 545; eighth,
413; vocational. 73.
These figures show thtt there is
an increase in everygrade except the
first. The great difference in the
figures for the first and second
grades is accounted for by the large
number of children who are forced
to take the first grade work over for
the second time. This year there
were 22 7 repeaters in the first grade.
A dropping off of an even 200 stu
dents between the fifth and sixth
grades shows that Just about that
number of children left school to go
to work as won as they had com
pleted the compulsory educational
requirements.

International News Service:
PARIS, Fei. 14. The Herman of
fensive in the west is increasing in
violence and is gradually extending
over the greater part of the front.
The most severe fighting is in r
tois. to the north of Arras, and in
Champagne, although the allies' po
sitions in Flanders, south of the
Somme, in the Woevre district and
in the Vosges mountains have been
subjected to severe bombardment.
Frencih military experts declare
that despite the numerous and vig
orous German attacks, there is no
ground for alarm. It is generally
believed that the assaults at most of
the points on the front are "feelers"
to find a weak spot for a concen
trated onslaught.
IYoim Ii Art Confident.
"It Is fpuite possible," one writer
says, "that the Germans may achieve
unimportant successes, occupying ad
viced trenches of the allies, but con
fidnce is felt that, in the event the
Germans attempt a decisive engage
ment at any point, they would be
hurled back with such severe losses
that they would never recover from
! them."
In Artois, where Crown Prince
Bupprecht of Bavaria, has leen di
recting the German operations, the
Teutons have suffered enormous
losses from the accurate artillery
fire of the French. Despite their se
vere casualties the Germans have
been unable to gain any ground in
the region north of Arras. In
Champagne where the Germans oc
cupied advanced trenches of the
French between Tahure and Somme
Py, counter attacks were launched
by the French before the Teutons
could fortify their new positions.

for reprisals for the Austrian air

there are no military works there.

that the church of Faint Apollonare

CHICAGO, Feb. 14. Armed with
photographs of William II. Orpet,
Fniversity of Wisconsin student,
charged with the murder of pretty
Marian Lambert, the high school
girl found dead In the woods near
the fashionable suburb of Lake For
est, detectives today started to visit
every drug .store in Chicago in an
effort to prove that Orpet bought
the poison that caused the girl's
death. It was definitely determined
that the poison responsible for the
tragedy was prussie acid, dissolved
in some liquid.
Two other developments In the
case today were:
Mrs. Imbert. the dead girl's
mother, pleaded with State's Atty.
Dady to set Orpet free and not
prosecute him.
Orpet, in an interview, declared
that .although he was responsible for
Marian Lambert's condition, he had
never loved the girl.
A search of the drug stores in
Madison, Wis., to determine whether
Orpet purchased poison there, ap
parently has failed. No drug store
proprietor or clerk was found who
could identify the pictures of Orpet
as the purchaser of any poison.
Letters Tell Romance.
The authorities investigating the
case have in their possession 60 let

of the romance from the time It be

the time when Orpet expressed a

the letter arranging, the secret meet

Suspected of Having Attempt

Catholic Banquet.
International News Service:
CHICAGO, Feb. 14. Arrest of
Jean Crones, mis-sing assistant chef
of the University club, who is sus
pected of having attempted to kill
more than 150 prominent Catholic
clergymen and other guests at the
banquet celebrating the installation
of Archbishop George W. Mundelein,
was expected today. Detectives
have established that Crones is an
anarchist, an anti-Catholic and an
expert on the subject of ioisonous
compounds.
Four hundred policemen have
been devoting their attention to the
poisoned soup ea.se, and one of the
ofheers in charge of the Investiga
tion said today that the arrest of
Crones like'.y would be made within
less than 2 4 hours.
Herman Schuettler. first deputy
superintendent of police, today ex
pressed the belief that 'rones was
not alone in the plot to kill the ban
quet guests.
He said it had been definitely es
tablished by the chemists who analyz
ed the tainted soup that the liquid
contained between one and one-half
to two grains of arsenic to each
j bowl. The original plans for the
banquet arranged covers for 200
guests. There were 2G at the tables,
and metre coup had to be made. This
decreased the amount of poison each
guest received, and it was believed
the dillution of the soup prevented
the killing of '2(o persons. Dr. John
Dill Robertson, cily health commis
sioner, declared tint had the extra
guets not appeared, each banqueter
would have- received more than two
grains of arsenic, a quantity suffic

white house to se the president.
The president, it is understood,
still was inclined to tränst r mem
ber of hi.- cabinet to the vacant post
and hen to fill the vacancy so creat
ed. It was very frankly stated that
