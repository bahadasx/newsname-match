Military Committees of Con
gress Studying Plan; Pay
Guardsmen a Feature .
f AaaocUUd Ttw ly TUnaX WirlM
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 13.
The military committee of both
House and Senate have now before
them a measure which, if passed, ill
affect very materially every national
guardsman in the Union, enabling the
militiamen to receive a certain am
ount of pay and making of the various
national guards a federal force.
This Is the bill which was drafted
by the representatives of the National
Guard Association for the purpose of
federalizing the militia and obviating
the necessity for the adoption of such
a plan as that proposed by former
Secretary of War Garrison, the crea
tion of a continental army which
would parallel to a certain extent the
National Guard. '
The essential features of the pro
posed measure are the following:
Pay Under Certain Conditions.
A force of 500 men to be recruited
In each congressional district, thus
raising a force of 200,000 men and in
creasing the present enlisted strength
of the National Guard by some 70,000.
This force to be raised and organ
ized in such a way as to become auto
matically a separate branch of the
regular army in the event of war.
These militiamen , to be paid by .
the federal government under certain
conditions, only those being paid who
comply with definite requirements of
drill, marksmanship and soldierly
qualifications to be prescribed.
One outstanding feature of the bill
is to establish a" Junior National
Guard, to be made up of boys between
the ages of 12 and 18 years, the ob
ject of which, will be to form a militia
reserve," from which trained recruits
for the guard will be obtained when
the. Junior militiamen arrive at the
age o( enlistment . , , ; ; ":

Loss of Code Book Declared to
Have Been Incentive for ?.
Department Order r
(Special Cable to Hawaii Shinpo.) -SAN
FRANCISCO, Cal., Feb. IS.
The loss of a naval code book from
the destroyer Hull some months ago
has afforded the San Francesco Exam
Iner the opportunity of opening up an
other series of attacks against tne
Japanese residents of California, the
Examiner stating that the code book
was stolen from the Hull bv a Jaoan-
ese steward named Fujo Mo to. This
boy is an illiterate, able to read
neither Japanese nor English and
quite incapable of distinguishing the
value of the stolen book. , ' T
' The fact that a Japanese steward
was employed on the Hull at the time
the code book was lost, however, has
resulted in an order from the navy de
partment at Washington under which
yesterday every Japanese in the
American naval ships was discharged.
There were a number of waiters and
stewards of Japanese nationality on
the warships yesterday, but there are
none today. "
Fuel has been added to the Examin
er's attacks by the fact that Rev. Ban
du Yabutshi, the veteran Buddhist
priest, has just purchased a tract of
a. thousand acres In Lower California,
Just below the line south of Ixs An
geles, where he states he will found
a model JaDanese colony. The Exam

of a colony so close to the California
