and Backers.
(Communicated.) <
In the platform thul the attorney
general as u candidate for tlie Republican
nomluatlon for governor submits
to the people for tliclr consideration,
he token issue with the present ,
adniinistration on the subject of
workmen's compensation, and criticises
tlio low and its administration
? a law Hint was first advocated by
the present governor in the personal;
pin 11 orm Unit he submitted directly
to the people in the primary campaign
of 11112. If wo are lo judge the '
attorney general s men imu juiamuiiregarding
tills most meritorious law
from the known position of his supporters
and financial backers, those
who were largely consulted as to what
he should stand for when he announced
Ills candidacy aud submit-1
ted his platform, such ns Z. T. Vinson,
W. I). Ord, George C. Mcintosh j
and others, who had the active cooperation
of the attorney general
during the last session ol the legislature,
it certainly behooves the industries
in general and the laboring
people to think long and well about '
what protection they would'bitvc with
respect to this law. if his candidacy:'
should be successful.
W. D. Ord, a representative of the
Coal Operators' Association, and, wo
are informed, a supporter of Mr. Lilly,
advocated and fought (or the fol-(
lowing amendments to the coinpen- 1
sation law In the legislature of 11115:
What Ord Wants.
That no compensation be paid
to the employee or his dependents
unless he (the employee) 1
had been a resident of the state
of West Virginia for one year !1
prior to the date he was Injured. '
Thut the employee pay Iwen- 1
tv-five ncr cent of the premiums '
Instead of ten per cent. 1
That the maximum rate of :
premium per $100 of pay roll
be $1.50 or $2 on all cluss except
that in certain specillcd induatriea
(in which coal was not included)
n rate not to exceed
per $100 of pay roll.
Iteduce the maximum amount
paid for funeral expenses from
$75 to $511.
Increase the waiting period,
during which no compnsatlon is
paid, from one to two jreeks
from date of injury. i
Leave the maximum and mln- ,
Imum amounts payable per ,
week at JS and $4. Instead of ;
increasing to $10 and $5, as was |
done In the amended act.
Elinlnate payment of compen
satlon to nil dependents not res- ,
idents or the United States.
Reduce the benefits pnyablo
in permanent disability cases to
half the amounts paid under the
amended act
Opposed vigorously the elec- '
tlve feature permitting Industries
to carry their own risk. i
Opposed the feature amend- (
ing the old lnw giving lite Injured
indemnity under the class- <
Ideation of temporary permn- ! |
nent disability; i. e., If the Id- 'i
jured lost a finger, Inslcad of ?
paylng liim bis weekly wage for |1
the time It took for the wound
to heal (which, if not Infected , :
would never take moro time than I
three weeks) he was paid based <
upon the value of the linger to
the position occupied. Tbe same '
applies to the hand below the i
wrist, or the foot below Ihe an- 1
kle.
Lilly Agreeh with Old.
So if we are to Judge Mr. Lilly by i
his bosses and, backers as represent- j
ed by Mr. Ord, and the language ha i
uses in keeping with the "screed" i
prepared by Mr. Ord, edited by .
Wrightman D. Roberts, and promul- I
gated under the auspices of (he Coal I
Operators' Association when be t
(Ord) failed In getting the amend- I
ments be desired at the last session i
of the legislature, we must conclude i
by comparing the "screed" with the J
Lilly declaration that he is in har- i
uiony with the ruinous position taken (
by Ord. I
It was the legislature of 1915 i
which first gave consideration to the j
compensation idea. It was the pres- ,
ent chief executive who, In company
with Senator Cray Silver and Judge |
James French Strother, went to Co- t
limihla .University at New York and
secured data from which to prepare
a law of this kind. After the data ]
was secured, ? bill was prepared In ,
keeping with the party pledge of ,
1 ill2, and which pledge was adopted ,
from the personal platform which ,
had been promulgated by Hatfield in ]
his declaration of principles to the |
people. i
The original bill permitted such a <
classification of Industries as is per- :
missible under the amended law of (
11)16, in order to define, separate and |
classify tha different Industries of the |
same class based on their Individual |
recordB. This Idea was for the purpose
of bringing about a campaign
against tho appalling number of accidents
so that each Individual Indus,
try owner would be moved to give
grenter diligence toward making a
good record, aa upon this accomplishment
would depend his claaalfivatlon
and rate.
Oppose Proposition,
Edward Knight and W. D. Ord
seemed to have charge of the compensation
measure so far as It affected
the coal Industry, In the 1915 legislative
session, so it was they who Insisted
that $1 on the 5100 pay roll I
should be tbe maximum limit for tbe
most hazardous Industries of the
state. It. was pointed out to these
gentlemen that $1 would not be suf- .
Ilcient to carry tbe rate on the most

Their Idea was permitted to prevail
ind the bill became a law in keeping
with that Idea.
Those gentlemen took the position
that the coal people throughout the
state should have the same rate, rogardloss
of their record In the way
of accidents, which, It was contended
by others, would work a great In- ,
justice upon mon connected with the ,
Industry who were desirous of reduc- ,
Ing the number of accidents In the j
conduct of their Industry to the mlnirauhi,
giving these faithful men no '
encouragement whatever to continue
tholr campaign, because under the
law thoy were to receive no special :
consideration over tho Industry own- .
er who was derelict and permitted n
greater number of accidents than hla 1
neighbor, which If the proper precautions
wore taken, would not have occurred,
The law became operative in (lecher,
1913. It soon became apparent
to tho public sendee commission, to
whom the administration of this law
was left, that tho $1 limit on the $100
pay roll was entirely too small to take
care ot the more hazardous industries
such as coal mining, quarrying, railroad
construction, powder mills and
mining. The commission therefore
lenAmlsolu nlabo/1 a lnrrrrtr rilta itnnri
a certain clans of Induitrles than was
necessary, to take caro of the industries
of the more hazardous class, the
result of which was that iudustries
of a less hazardous class were placed
In position to assume a part of the
Indemnities of more hasardous Industries.
It is true that none of this
excess rate charged to these less hazardous
Industries was used to take
are of. the Indemnities of the more
hazardous schedules for the reason
that the law has been amended, and
those Industries that are delinquent
have by law been required to. make
good by an Increased rate the amount
>f their unprotected liability to this
fund. Had the law. continued in operation
as It was passed by the legislature
of 1913, this surplus over
and above any Indemnities occasioned
by the less hazardous Industries <
arould have unquestionably <?f necesilty
been applied to take care of the
