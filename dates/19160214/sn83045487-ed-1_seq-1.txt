SAY, JOHN:
I read your piece in the paper. .1 mean your editorial in the Manu
facturers' News the one which starts off by saying: "Let the manu-
facturers of this country take the lead in organizing an army of defense.
The material is at hand the best in the world. In the industrial plants
there are millions of men, physically perfect, many of them mentally way
above the average, clean-cut men of brawn, athletic, well put together
ideal timber for the finest volunteer army in the world. Organize them
into companies, regiments, brigades. The army would be a world beater.
Have drills once a day with or without arms calisthenics, setting up
exercises. Uniforms, parades, rifle practice, trench digging, practice hikes
This United States Industrial Army, if never called upon fo defend the
nation, would repay in a thousand ways the trouble and expense."
