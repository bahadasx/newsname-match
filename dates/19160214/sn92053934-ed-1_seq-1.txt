WILSON LETS
HIS NAME BE
USED IN OHIO
President Gives His Formal
Consent to Be Made a
Candidate.
NOT OPEN TO CONTEST
Willing to Be Placed on the
Ticket for the Primary
but Not to Fight.
Washington, Feb. 14. President
Wilson today formally gave his con
sent that his name be used as a can
didate for renomination. In a letter to
the secretary of state of Ohio the pres
ident said he was unwilling to enter a
contest for the nomination, but was
ready to permit the use of his name in
the coming primary in order that the
democrats of Ohio might make known
their preference.
The president stated his position in
order to comply with the Ohio pri
mary law, which requires candidates
for delegates to the party conventions
to make known their first and second
choices before Feb. 25, and requires
that the candidates for delegates have
the consent of their choice to make
use of their names.
The president was formally notified
of the requirements of the law last
week.
Allows Use of Name,
President Wrilson wrote to Secre
tary of State Hildebrant of Ohio as
follows:
"While I am entirely unwilling to
enter into any contest for the prest
dential nomination of the democratic
party, I am willing to permit the use
of my name that the democrats of Ohio
may make known their preference in
regard to that nomination.
"In order, therefore, to satisfy the
technical requirements of the statutes
of the state of Ohio, I hereby consent
to the use of my name as a candidate
for the presidency by any candidate
who seeks to be elected a delegate to
the national democratic convention
which is to assemble in June next."
Choice Left to Toters.
This was the first time the president
has consented formally to have his
name used in connection with the
nomination. His name has been plac
ed on primary ballots in several
states, however, through the activities
of friends.
The president takes the position
that the voters will have to deter
mine whether he will make the race
for the presidency in 1916 as the dem
ocratic candidate. In a letter to A.
Mitchell Palmer, then a representa
tive from Pennsylvania, at his inaug
uration, Mr Wilson made it plain .he
would only be a candidate again if the
democratic voters desired it.
Advisers and friends of the presi
dent have taken it for granted for
months that he would be the nominee
of his party and have made their plana
accordingly.

Washington, Feb. 14. National pre
paredness problems again today hold
the center of the stage in congression
al committee activity.
Having concluded its hearings on
military defense questions, Chairman
Chamberlain and his associates on the
senate military committee today be
gan framing a bill on the subject. They
were to incorporate in the measure a
plan of federalization of the national
guard to create a reserve defense
force. As their work progresses tb
senate committee proposes to confei
frequently with members of the house
military committee.
Chairman Hay and members of the
house committee resumed work today
of redrafting the house defense bill to
eliminate the continental army fea
ture and place in its stead the plan of
federalizing state troops. The house
naval committee today began an ex
haustive inquiry into submarine war
fare and the alleged shortcomings of
American submarines. Rear Admiral
Albert W. Grant, assigned by Secre
tary Daniels several months ago to
command the submarine flotilla of the
Atlantic fleet, was ready to take the
witness stand-and reveal the results of
his close study of the underwater
craft His examination was expected
to last well into the week.
Commander Yates Stirling who com
manded the fleet last year and who
made revelations concerning the inef
ficiency of the suDmersibles, is expect
ed to follow Admiral Grant.
At the present rate of progress
Chairman Padgett of the committee
does not believe that the naval appro
priation bill will be ready to place be
fore the house until the latter part of
May. The senate naval committee will
not consider the bill until the house
committee hearings are nearing an
end.
Coast Defense Poor.
Limited cruising radius, unsea
worthiness and other limitations of the
coast defense type of submarines made
it advisable hereafter to build only
submersibles of the 1,000 ton fleet sub
marine type of which three have been
authorized and none yet complete, said
Admiral Grant.
Admiral Grant said he had posi- '
tive knowledge that German boats
from U-39 to U-58 inclusive displaced
800 tons on the surface as against 450
tons for the K boats of the American
navy, the largest in the service. For
months the German boats, he said, had
operated out of Heligoland and around
Scotland at a distance of 1,300 miles
from their base. It took them nine days
days to make the round trip, he said,
and they remained on the operating
station 13 days unless driven to base
sooner through having used up the
torpedo supply. Three of these U
boats, he said, could keep the cycle
working so one was always on the op
erating station. To do the same things
he said, the United States would re
quire 22 class K boats because of their
10-day sea service limitation.
Admiral Grant thought it unwise to
construct any submarine of less than
20. knot speed and said this could not
be done on a small boat. He urged
that the minimum size of the future
boatsybe S00 tons surface displace
ment. "I consider 10 days to be the limit of
time men should stay at sea on a K
boat, our largest type, and that limit
must be reduced for smaller boats.
Ten days is the limit of time a K boat
can stay at sea and be at all effective.
"For months the big German subma
rines operated from- Heligoland as a
base, around the coast of Ireland, a
round trip of 2,700 miles.
"If we had no engine trouble and If
the K boats could make 12 knots an
hour, it would require 22 K boats to
do what three of the 800 ton German
U boats did for months. Three U boats
will cost $2,500,000 and 22 K boats
$10,000,000."
Captain McKeen, assistant for ma
terial in the operations division In tha
navy department, said that so far
American submarine experiments had
not produced satisfactory engines or
motive power for submerged running.
Recent experiment with the K boats,
he said, bad indicated that engine
trouble would soon be eliminated
largely "ut that the storage battery for
submerged operation remained the
great problem to be solved.
