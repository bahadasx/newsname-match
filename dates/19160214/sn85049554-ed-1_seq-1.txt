appealed to State's Attorney Ralph
Dady, of Lake county, to release WIN

charge of murder. Frank Lambert.
father of the girl, assented to tbe plea
of his wife. The Lamberts told the
state's attorney they had doubts of the
guilt of young Orpet and they had no
dealre to push the case.
State's Attorney Dady was willing to
admit today that unless he can prove
that Orpet gave hla former sweetheart
poison he can not convict the student
of murder.
Csn't Trsce Poison Purohsse.
Altho the nature of the poison whlcN
caused the girl's death fias been de*
termlned by a partial analysis of the
stomach, the officers are' at a loss to
account for the container. Sheriff
Griffin said his men had searohed ev
er}' section of the woods and had vis
ited every drug store in Madison and
in towns along the lake shore from
Waukegon to EJvanston. Pictures of
Orpet were shown but no evidence wa»
found that he had purchased poison.
The Inquest, it is expected, will be
resumed on Wednesday. By time,

Letters Traoe Romanoe.
These letters trace the romance
from its Inception,- when the boy and
girl were pupils at the Deerfleld high
school In Highland Park, until it came
within the shadow of the girl's un
happy condition which was the direct
cause of the tragedy.
The missives breathe the passion of
the two when the romance was at its
height. They disprove conclusively the
young man's cold assertion since hla
arrest thnt he did not care for the girl,
and that If there was any love it was
all on her side.
His letters to the young woman In
the first Phases of the affair are filled
with tender sentiment and words of
endearment. From beginning to end
her letters to him are all ardor and de
votion.
Crisis Last September.
From the letters It wns plain the
romance renched a crisis last Septem
ber.
It
From thnt time the young man's
ardor began to cool. He wrote less
frequently. His letters, which former
ly had been caresses In pen and Ink,
became mere formal eplstlts, only
casuallv friendly.
Tho Other Woman Appears.
Finally there arrived the time when
the shadow of the other woman fell
across romance. Miss Celeste Youker,
the assistant teacher of chemistry in
the De italb Normal school, had
stepped Into young Orpet's life. He
wrote to Miss Lambert and told her
of his change of affection. He declared
he no longer loved her and must break
off all relations with her.
The girl's letters were pathetic in
their pleas not to be cast off. She
begged him to continue to be her
f.Wrriheari. io love her as he had he
fore.
For a time there is a break In tho
continuity of the letters—a hiatus ln
which both ceased to write. Then a
letter written by Orpet seems almost
like a blow in the face ln Us direct at
tempt to rid himself of the girl who
had ceased to interest him. There
must have been a meeting between ths
two about this time. A later letter
refers to a clandestine tryst in Helm's
woods.
Motherhood Fear Agsin.
Then came the final phase. Fear of
the glrKs approaching motherhood
again aroused them both. The last
letter was mailed from Madison In &
letter to Miss Josephine Davis, and
was delivered to Miss Lambert the day
before her death. It arranged for the
fatal meeting in the woods.
In its intimate revelations this re
markable epistilary history shows how
Orpet won the heart of the maid,
ruined her life, tired of her at last,
and tossed her aside for another. Ths
tragedy in the woods was the end of

WAS evident' that soon after­
