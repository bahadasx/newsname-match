Offensive In Champagne
Section Gives 700 Yards
of French Trenches Into
1he Hands of the German
Troops
The Germans are fiercely attacking
the French positions in the Artois sec
tion, as well as in Champagne. In the
Latter district Berlin reports the cap
ture of a front of about 700 yards while
the French admit that the Germans
have gained a footing in some of their
anvanced trenches near the Tahura-Somme-Py
road.
On the British front there have bon
sapping operations and bombardments
by both sides.
The heavy guns are being actively
employed on tioth sides in the northern
section of the Russian front, but no
important changes in positions have
occurred.
In the Isonzo region the Austi ians
have taken from the Italians entrench
ments in the Rombon zone, while the
Italian artillery has bombarded Aus
trian positions at various points, es
pecially in the Gorizia sector.
Austrian seaplanes have attacked the
town of Ravenna in northeastern Italy
and several other places in that vicin
ity. Fifteen persons are said to have
been killed and a number injured.
On the Black Sea Russian torpedo
boat destroyers have sunk additional
Turkish sailing vessels and have de
stroyed .bridges and depots ashore.
The French cruiser Admiral Charner,
it is feared by the French ministry of
marine, has been Ibst, while patroling
the Syrian coast. The cruiser has not
been heard from since February 8.
when a German dispatch reported that
a submarine had sunk a French war
ship. The German gunboat Hcdwig von
Wissmann has been sunk on Lake
Tanganyika, Africa by the Belgians.
Fighting In Champagne
BERLIN, Feb 13. (Via London)
Heavy fighting is in progress in Cham
pagne. The German war office an
nounced today the capture of French
positions extending over a front of
700 yards. In Flanders the Germans
penetrated positions of the entente al
lies. The statement follows:
"Western front: In Flanders, after
live'y artillery fighting, our-patrols and
strong reconnoitering detachments
penetrated positions of the enemy. Sev
ern mines were exploded effectively.
Southeast of Bosinghe more than forty
Englishmen were captured.
"British artillery bombarded the
town of Lille yesterday and , Friday.
Considerable damage was done but
there was no loss of life or destruction
of military property.
"On our front between Labassee ca
nal and Arras and also south of the
Snmme. hostilities were impeded by
bad weather. In the fighting in the
region northwest and west of Vimy up
t February 9 we captured nine offi
cers,' 6x2 rnen, 35 machine guns, two
mine throwers and stores of various
descriptions. Our artillery shelled
heavily the enemy's positions between
the Oise and Rheims with good suc

successfully made two violent attacks.

The analysis showed that the
guests who partook of the soup
missed death by a narrow margin.
The poison used was white oxide ar
senie. Dr. Tonney said that his es
timate showed that the portions
served each guest contained 1 1-2
grains of the drug.
His calculations showed that the
entire kettle of soup contained 480
grains. This development was re
garded as significant by detectives
working on the case. In the amateur
laboratory of Jean Crones, the miss
ing assistant chef at the club, an

arsenic, but which was empty was
found. An ounce of drug contained
