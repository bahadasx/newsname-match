figure at which Mr. McClellan, who is
an attorney1 and resided In Honolulu
a number of years, could be secured.

Clellan' services la under advisement
by of'cers of the chamber, it was
learned today. -
Though nothing has been made pub
lic of Kuhlo's . cablegram, the fact of
Its being received and naming a Ag
ere for McClellan's services was con
firmed by President Waldron and Sec
retary Brown this morning. -The fig
ure was not given out. ,
A factor which Is entering to some
extent into the situation Is the plan
