For Action.
ARE WITHOUT
OFFICIAL COMPLAINT
Believe They Have Authori
ty to Promulgate Ruling
on Subject.
(Herald Special Service.)
Bismarck, N. D.„ Feb. 14.—No rule
trill be ^promulgated by the state rail
road commission to establish any fixed
charge for the storing and handling
of grain on the part of warehouse
men in North Dakota, such decision
being announced by the statte railroad
commission today. It is the result of
the conference held last week at Par
go, when the whole proposition was
considered.
Absence of any definite or formal
complaint of conditions that would
tend to make It advisable for the
commission to take over the power
of fixing a set charge for storage, Is
given in the official report of the pro
ceedings and decision, as the basis for
the refusal to take a hand in the
situation.
Discussing the conference, and the
order, the commission's formal state
ment says:
Have Opposite Views.
"The representatives of the line
companies and independent com
panies, and also of those farmers'
companies which do not distribute
their dividends upon the patronage
basis, were quite generally in jfavor.
of a rule regarding the uniform
charge for the storage and handling
of grain where it is not purchased at
time of delivery by the' warehouse
man. On the other hand, the repre
sentatives of those elevators which are
organized upon a mutual or co-opera
tive basis, and perhaps more nearly
representing the grain growers than
liny other class of warehousemen, op
posed the establishment of any'suoh
rule, although they themselves might
be at the time charging storage, their
contention being that each elevator
•hould be permitted to manage its own'
business accor41n«uto 4ts ow,® ngieth
Qds 8*"fong ~ft8 It complied wlth'tMs
law and regulations enacted by the
~««tlimls8tbnV
"Those favoring a compulsory stor
agecharge took the position that the'
storage of grain Involved the neces
sary outlay of labor and expense
which must be paid for in some way,
and if not paid for by a reasonable
and legitimate charge, made directly
against the person storing the grain,
it would have to be absorbed from
the price paid for or from the profits
of the business in some way. If the
business was to be profitable, and they
further contended that the granting
of free storage was an unfair method
of competition and amounted to dis
crimination in the buying of grain,
which In its effect was demoralizing
to the grain trade. On the other hand,
the exponents,of the free storage idea
contended that this enabled the farm
ers to store their grain at the primary
market during the busy season and
fall, and avoided glutting the market
with grain at any one time, and per
mitting the distribution of the pro
ducts of the farm over a larger space
of time, and resulting In the farmers
themselves realizing larger proceeds
from their grain.
Impressed With Contention.
While the commission is impressed
with each of the contentions, first,
that a uniform rule is desirable In or
der to prevent, any chance of discrim
ination, and second, that on the other
hand the farmer should be encour
aged to hold his grain from the mar
ket, if he so desired, until such time
as the market would be right, yet a
careful reading of the statute con
vinces us that it prohibits the com
mission from making any such rule
in the absence of a showing that the
granting of free storage results iii
abuses which amount to a violation
of the anti-discrimination act. Re
vised codes, 1918, section 8116 pro
vides that the charge for storing and
handling of grain shall not exceed
certain rates therein set forth, and It
would unquestionably appear from
this provision that there would be
no way to fix a uniform charge either
at the maximum rate, or any other
intermediate point down to nothing,
hence if a warehouseman prefers to
store his customer's grain for nothing
the law would seem to grant him this
privilege.
B«lleve They Have Authority.
While the commission would insist
upon its jurisdiction to make a rule
which would prevent any abuses
growing out of this practice that
would violate the spirit or letter of
the antl-dlscHmination act. before we
would be Justified In taking such a
step we would have to be thoroughly
convinced that evils of this sort exist
ed, and in view of the fact that al
though warehousemen of the state
were quite generally represented at
the conference, no specific complaint
was made and the commission having
received no complaint from the grain
producers which would be traceable
to any such evil, we are constrained
to hold that It is neither possible or
feasible at this time to make any rul
ing or regulation regarding any fixed
charge for the storing and handling
of grain on the part of the warehouse
men.
However the commission feels that
the conference was not without sub
stantlal and valuable results because
the exchange of ideas and views on
part of both the commission and the
warehousemen engaged In the storage
of grain must necessarily result In
benefit to both.

SAYS TALK IS
ALL NONSENSE
Busybodies Roundly Scored
by the Speaker in
Statement.
Washington, Feb. 14. Speaker
Clark issued a statement last night
characterizing as nonsense talk of
ousting Representative Kltchln from
the house majority leadership becailse
of his opposition to the preparedness
program and other administration
plans. He said he expected to leave
the speaker's chair whenever he felt
it necessary to oppose or support any
measure, but would do so without
any intent to supplant Representative
Kitchinor any other committee .chair
man or leader.
Should Agree.
"It's a pity," said the speaker, "that
all democrats do not agree about all
things but Mr. Kltchln has as much
right to his opinion as the president
has to his or I have to mine. I have
faith that by the exercise of fore
bearance, moderation and wisdom we
sholL evolve plans for preparedness
and other great questions, such as
raising revenue on which we can all
stand. That is my hope and expecta
tion.
"No man can' pull a proposition
through the house- by main strength.
"The entire philosophy of success
in that able and tumultuous assembly
is to take things by the smooth han
dle, to rub the hair the right way of
the hide and to confer freely with
members, persuading rather than at
tempting to drive, yielding in non-es
sentials, firm as a rook on funda

GONSQIT NAME
Letter to Ohio Secretary
puts Him on Record as
a Candidate.
CONFIRMS STANDING
BELIEF OF MANY
Plans Had Been Made With
Idea in View That He
Would Make Race.
Washington, Feb. 14-—President
Wilson today formally, jrave his con
sent that his name be used as a can
didate for re-nomination.
In a letter to the secretary of the
state of Ohio, Wilson stated he is un
willing to enter a contest for the nom
ination, but Is ready to permit the use
of his name In the coming primary in
order that the democrats of Ohio
might make known their preference.
President Wilson made known his
position In order to comply with the
Ohio primary law, which requires
candidates for delegates to party con
ventions to make known their first
and second choices before February
25, and also requires that candidates
for delegates have the consent of their
choices to make use of their names.
President Wilson was formally no
tified of the requirements of the law
last week and today he wrote Charles
Q. Hlldebrant, secretary of the state
of Ohio, as follows:
"I am enclosing to you a letter, the
occasion of which I dare say will be
quite obvious. Friends in Ohio have
called my attention to section 4964,
of the General Code of Ohio, as amed
ed In 1914, with regard to primary
elections, and have requested that I
indicate my willingness to have my
name used. I accordingly take the
liberty of sending you the enclosed
letter as formal permission under the
statute."
The letter the president enclosed Is
as follows:
"While I am entirely unwilling to
enter into any contest for the presi
dential nomination of the democratio
party, I am willing to permit the use
of my name that the democrats In
Ohio may make known their prefer
ence' in regard to that nomination. In
order, therefore, to satisfy the techni
cal requirements of the statutes of
the state of Ohio, I hereby consent
to the use oi my name as candidate
for fchef nresldsBcy by any candidate
who" seeks to be elected a delegate to
the national democratic convention
which Unto assemble next June."
first Consent.
1
This" is this first time the president
has consented formally to have his
name used in connection with tbe
nomination. His name has been placed
on the primary ballots in several
states, however, through the, actlvl
*jeB of friends. The president takes
the position that the voters will have
to determine whether he will make a
race for the presidency this year as a
democratic candidate.
In a letter written to A. Mitchell
Palmer, then representative from
Pennsylvania, before his inaugura
tion, Wilson made it plain that he
would only be a candidate again If the
democratic voters desired it.
Political advisors and friends of the
president have taken for granted for
months that he would be a nominee,
and made their plans accordingly. A
formal announcement was expected
by democratio leaders to clarify the
political situation throughout the
country. Supporters of the president
and leaders said they would now be
able to work for him more openly.
Premier Venizelos

Paris, Feb. 14.—The Journal's cor

Everyone Who Ate Soup ait

cape says Dr. Tonney.
Chicago, Feb. 14.—Analysis of the
poisoned soup which made a hundred
or more guests violently ill at a ban
quet given Archbishop Mundelein
here last Thursday night at the Uni
versity club was completed by Dr.
Frederick O. Tonney yesterday.
Narrowly Missed Death.
The analysis showed that the guest*
who partook of the soup missed death
by a narrow margin. The poison used
was white oxide of arsenic. Dr. 'Ton
ney said that his estimate showed
that the portions served each guests
contained 11-2 grains of the drug.
His calculations showed that the
entire kettle of soup contained 480
grains. This development was regard
ed significant by detectives working:
on the case. In the amateur laboratory
of John Crones, the missing assistant
chef at the club, an ounce bottle said
to have contained arsenic but which
was empty, was found. An ounce of
the drug contains 480 grains. Crones
disappeared on the night of the ban

night. Hinton G. Clabaugh, chief of
the Chicago bureau of investigation
of the department of justice, joined
In the search. The bureau Is said to
