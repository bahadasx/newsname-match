"If I can I will come back some one to be
proud of,'' wrote Private Harry Dale to his
mother just before he left the English
trenches to go forward on the dangerous

Dale never came back. He had, however,
made himself "some one to lie proud of"
long before he left London to fight for his
country.

ONLY Picture of Mysterious Raider
This photo of tho German raider that captured the Appam and sent it in
to Hampton Roods in charge of a prise crew was taken by a British official
who was on the Appam.
Realising the Germans would confiscate all photographs, he quickly took
the film from his camera and concealed the photograph in oil-proof paper in
an inside vest pocket.
This is the only picture of the boat that sei/.ed Ihe Appam, but whether
it is the Ponga or a new raider named the lfoewe, is not known, outside
Berlin. ' .

LETTERS TELL STOIIY
CHICAGO, Feb. 14. -Burning
letters of love and passionate de
votion unfold step by step the
events which led lo the final act
In the love tragedy of Marion
Frances Lambert, the high school
girl whose body was found In the
woods at Lake Forest last week.
The girl's former sweetheart,
William H. Orpet, junior at the
University of Wisconsin, Is lodged
in jail today on a charge of mur
der, although the state has not
reached a conclusion whether the
death was due to suicide or mur
der.
Relieve He's Innocent.
Efforts were made today to
free the lad before night. The
girl's mother believes Orpet in
nocent of giving poison to the
girl under the guise of a medi
cine to correct her condition. She
is aiding Orpet's mother in tlie
fight to save him.
The Lambert and Orpet fami
lies, as caretakers of adjoining
millionaire estates at Lake For
est, have been friends for years.
Miss Josephine Davis, chum of
the dead girl, will testify that
the latter planned suicide, ac
cording to Orpet's parents.
Girl Was Normal.
Orpet passed a quiet night in
his cell and was refreshed this
morning. He dressed carefully,
and the college boy manner
seemed to return to him. He
again asked tbat he might see
his mother.
Post mortem examiners today
reiterated that there waa no rea
son for the girl to take abortive
medicines.
Friends of Orpet held the the
ory that the girl sought to hold
him by deceiving him thus.
Then Grow Cooler. "
The passionate letters, 60 !n
all, tell the story of the unhap
py romance from its very begin
ning when the boy and girl were
chums at the Deerfleld high
school at Highland park.
They trace its development itp
to the time last September Whan
the girl found herself In the un
happy condition which led direct
ly to the final tragedy.
Orpet's first letters to the
girl, when he was a freshman at
college, are filled with tender af
fection.
When the girl's condition
alarmed them, however, his let
ters gradually became cooler and
less frequent.
Implores Him to Be True. _■
