WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. 14.
It was learned today that announce
ment of Garrison's successor to the
office of secretary of war will be de
ferred several days. The cause of the
delay is unknown.
Wilson today began a series of con
ferences with congressional leaders.
These are believed to have a bearing
upon tho appointment.
Secretaries Lane and Houston are
prominently mentioned. German
A merican people oppose Lane because
of his being a native of Canada. Col
onel House, Joseph Folk and Frank
!yn Roosevelt are all mentioned, as
possible men for the office.
The state department has received
the official text of the German note
announcing Germany's Intention of
torpedoing armed enemy merchant
men without warning.
President Wilson is In perfect ac
cord with Secretary Lansing's policy
toward this plan. Contrary reports
are unfounded.
A high official says the president
considers the issues which may re
sult from this latest Teuton order as
fraught with the gravest possibilities.
The German note makes no distinc
tion between passenger and freight
steamers. Both will be sunk without
varnlng. If they are armed.
The Austrian note arrived late today.

Et.ru Meeker, n well known Oregon'
Says City Prohi Law Is
Sure to Burden Taxpayer
By Citizen
Tho prohibition law, so far as it
provides for penalties for Its viola
tion, is a general criminal statute.
The penalties provided for a viola
tion of its provisions range as fol fel fol
eows: For Urst violation, a flue of not
I more than ?500 or imprisonment not
more than six months, or by both such
THEJfino and imprisonment.
For the second violation, not less
than $100 nor more than f500 or
MOST CERTAIN TO BREAK OUT! by Imprisonment not less than three
mpnths nor more than one year.
I For tho third violation, two years
! In the county jail,
I Under this state prohibition statute
the sale and distribution of all in
toxicating liquors Is absolutely pro
hibited ia the city of Klamath Falls,
except as therein provided. A glance
at the penalties provided for ita viola
tion would convince the most skeptl- ,
cal bootlegger that the state of Or- "
cgoii meant business. '
The common council has no power
to exempt the" city from Its provisions,
neither has It the authority to enact .
the state prohibition statute at an
ordinance of the city providing there
in for lesser and lighter penalties for .
its violation within the city limits.
If the council possessed that author- '
ity, It would simply amount, to a
declaration that the state prohlWUea
luw could be violated within the city ,
limits a whole lot cheaper than aay-
where else in the state or county. -, .
