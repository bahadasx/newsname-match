After reciting the benefits to

lias Assisted the Alllec.
"If it is considered for a moment
what the operations of the entente
powers would have been without this
elasticity, given the notion of neu
trality, it doubtless cannot fall to be
understood what Greece has been to
the cause of the entente during the
war.
"Hut there have been reproach
that Greece did not keep her en
gagement with Serbia, that she de
serted her ally at a critical moment
d, spite the assurances of nil those
governments that the terms of the
i Ireeo-Sorbian treaty w ould be com

special reasons to appreciate our al
liance with Serbia as I myself took
i an active part In the negotiations
leading to tho alliance.
"I can affirm that the treaty did not
obligate Greece to enter a campaign
I to defend Sorbin, simultaneously at
tacked by Bulgaria and the central
powers. It is a Ilalkan treaty ap
plying only to lialkan policy."

The prince goes on to say that the
treaty engaged Serbia to furnish cer

proved materially impossible of ful
