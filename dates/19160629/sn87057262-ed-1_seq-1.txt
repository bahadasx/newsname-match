leader, made an impassioned speech

afternoon.
"In England alone In the twentieth

am proud to be a rebel."
The first announcement of the ver

he arose to address the court, his
voice quavered so that his remarks
could scarcely be heard. As he con

he should "hang by the neck until

WASHINGTON, June 29.—A pan

detachments of the armies of the
United States, Argentine, Brazil, Chile
and possibly other LaMn-American
republics to restore, not to crush
Mexico.
This is the suggestion brought to
the attention of the administration
and South American officials today
from certain quarters, which it is be
lieved eventually will lead to serious
consideration of the project. Latin
America cannot conceive of war be
tween the Jnited States and Mexico,
according to Ambassador Naon of Ar
gentine, who set this forth clearly
with a strong appeal for the preser
vation of Pan-Americanism yesterday.
To those interested in furthering the
Pan-American movement, the present
crisis between the United States and
Mexico is regarded as a vital test of
the principles for which the powers
of the Americas have been striving.
Strife between nations of the Amer
icas would be regarded by them as
virtual civil war. They point out that
every treaty negotiated between Euro
pean powers has fallen apart. With
all the rest of the world divided, they
contend that the Americas must pre

the American nations would mean an
immediate division into groups, thus
weakening the entente, and leaving
the way open at the end of the Euro
pean war for possible influence if not
domination from abroad.
To preserve the strength and unity
of the Americas, Latin-America as
well as administration men working
in the Interests of Pan-Americanism
declare it is imperative first that
now, and second that a way be found
to enforce continued peace in the
future. This brings the suggestion of
a pan-American police force.
It is pointed out that most of the
theories of the world peace advanced
to date have been based upon the
establishment of an international po
lice force. In the present «ltuation
between the United Statep and
Mexico and the working out of the
general plan of pan-Americanism,
those behind the movement seo the
possibility of a test of the theory
upon which may rest the hope of in
ternational peace.
Successful joint action by the na
tions of the Americas in pacifying and
restoring stricken Mexico would have
great Influence In Europe, It is be
lieved, toward providing the practic
ability of International "police" work.
Latin-American powers do not re
gard Mexican responsibility for the
Carrizal clash as proved. In fact the
note of Captain Morey rather suggests
to them possible provocative action
by the American troops. Their view
Is that the stake for which the na
tions of the two continents are play
ing in advancing pan-Americanism Is
too great to be jeopardised through
war, baaed on such a disputed Inci
dent.
