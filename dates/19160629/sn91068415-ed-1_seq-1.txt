A TOAST TO THE SOLDIERS.
The waited call has come at last
And you have answered true,
Here's to you, then, brave gentlemen,
Our hats are off to you .
The first to hear the bugle call
The first to answer, Herel
The first to know "war's cruel blow
The first to win a cheer.
vo its our best we give to you
" At parting here today
We're with you there, no matter where,
Ycur duty bids you stay.
God speed the time of ycur return
Vou leave our hearts so sore,
But you are strong and it won't be long
"Till e clasp your nanas once moie.

Patriotic High Point, in
Grand Review.
The greatest outburst of patriot
ism High Point ever saw took place
Friday night on Main street , when
six thousand people turned out to
greet the soldiers who were to leave
the following night in the service of
Uncle Sam, and tp wish them God's
speed. - r
A band was stationed on top of
Bank of Commerce and another on
the ground and both played livel
air but when the notes of our be
loved "Dixie" were heard the people
simply went wild.
The word was passed rhat the
soldier boys were coming and from

New Bank for High Point
insu i-omt is to nave a new bank
to be run on the Morris plan which
consists in. making small loans to
people in moderate circumstances at
6 per cent, interest Salisbury.
Asheville and Spencer have such
hanks and High Point will make the
fourth institution of the kind in the
state. The capital- stock will be
$40,000. O. E. Mendenhall will be
secretary, and Robert Morrow, treas
urer. ..
The Morris plan is as simple as
can be. There are no deposits and
therefore no liablities. An v amount
is loaned on good security at the
rate of 6 per cent, interest. Two
per cent, of the amount of the loan
is paid back each week.
A $50 loan, for example, is made
as follows:
A borrower calls at the office of
the company and files an applica
tion for a loan of $50, and offers
the names of two persons who he
has learned will sign his note with
him as co-makers.
The standing and responsibility of
the applicant and co-makers is then
investigated, and if the discount
committee passes favorably on the
application the applicant is advised
1.1 xl. i i
inai me loan win De granted.
The applicant, together with his
co-makers then sign a note provided
by the company, payable in one year
after date in a sum equal to the
amount of the loan required. Six
per cent, interest on this amount is
collected or deducted in advance
by the company for the period for
which the loan is made. The bor
rower also pays a fee of $1.00 for
the investigation of his collateral
security. The borrower then sub
scribes to a "Class C' certificate,
which is an installment certificate,
for $50. When the note is executed,
this certificate is assigned to the
company and becomes a security
for the note and a protection to the
the co-maker.
The borrower pays $1 per week
for fifty weeks on this certificate
At the end of , fifty weeks his pay

" Personal Influence.
,.4 i (Written for The Review.)
(CHAPTER 2)
Life has been aptly described asr
made up of many influences. This
is ooviousiy true, numan lite is
expressed through the unity of innu
merable and separate influences
all centering "and uniting . in the
combined whole, and makes char
acter. Could we but make a psy
cological analysis of the human
mind, these formative elements!
which we call influences would
doubtless be clearly shown in many
surprising forms no lesa astounding
for their countless numbers than for
the strange sources from which they
eminated.
We cannot fully estimate the
power and importance of personal
influence in the formation and
moulding of human character or the
part it plays in all the phases of our
earthly life. We are what we are
through the power of influences set
iu motion all along the years of oiir
past life, reaching back probably to
the very beginning of our earthly
existence. In the changed thought
and feeling, in our loves and hates k
in our likes and dislikes we are
brought into conscious realization of
the presence and force of human
influence in the shaping and mould
ing of our lives and its consequnce
upon our joys and happiness.
Human nature is easily suscepti
ble to the influences of those conditions-
which please the eye, charm
the mind, appeal to the reason, cre-
ate a desire for possession and satis-
fy the heart. This fact is abundantly
shown and expressed in the lives of
those around us and in our own life
as well. And these influences are
not always of the wholesome and
helpful kind. We meet jwith much
in life to antagonize our petter na
ture and higher ideals, warp our
judgment and draw our footsteps
into ways that can lead only to sor
row and regret
The measure of yourinfluence in
the life of another ist not determined
by the greatness of your intellect or
the y ' v'astness f of your ;;lacadeniic
khowlekge, or jby.vthe bul&i of yoor
flu nee in the control of human des
tiny, but upon the affection gained
and the confidence any respect ir
spired in the hearts and' minds "of
others. ' .
Every one as he holds the best
interest of his fellowman at heart
should consider with deep and
abiding concern the possible effect
of his own life Upon that of others, for
every word spoken, every act com
mitted may in their effective power
to impress be but another link ad
ded to the chain of influences bind
ing some life to inexorible destiny,
and shall it be an unhappy one?
These influences may not be visible,
you may not be conscious of any
source of influence in your own life,
in, the secret recess of the heart, un
known to you, they may fall and
spring into life and be forever hid
den from you m their "effect upon
another's life, but they are ever
flowing out from you affecting the
faith, the hope, the joy and the han-
pmess of those about you.
We should always endeavor to
give out the best there is in us that
we may receive the best in others.
This is a principle of action which
should be made the rule of life by
every ne, but which is too often
violated in many ways in pur, per
sonal relations one with another.
By imparting good to others we
shall also receive good in return
even from the very act itself. There
is in evey word and deed a reflect
ing force which inevitably rebounds
to bless or to curse the doer.
(CHAPTER 3)
As has been shown no age or con
dition of life is beyond the touch of
human influence. No reach of
mighty intellect, no position of
worldly power may resist its per
suasive reasoning. You must re
spond either to the claims of duty
and higher ideals, or else yield to
the wooing call of carnal pleasure
and selfish gratification. There is
that indefinable something in the
active living forces of human life
that unresistingly appeals to every
one in language of convincing argu
ment and pleasing form, for just
and noble livings or enticingly bids
us come to the banquet board of
delight and revel in the charm of
abandoned indulgence.
There is posessed in every life an
unconscious influence which is far
reaching-in its ultimate effect on the
lives of those-brought within close
and receptive contact of its action

It is the unostentatious and unob
trusive expression of individuality,

make them easily won and led into
ways strange and new. In their
tender age their young minds are
most sensitive to first impressions
and their hearts quickly respond to
sympathy, kindness and encourage
ment. '
The young are also as susceptable
to influences of evil. The very un
development of their young minds
and their inexperience in the many
and varied ways of the world make
them easy victims of the wiles of
the charmer. There are so many
things to turn them away from the
right life, so many evil examples
held up before them is it any won
der so many precious lives are
drawn into the whirlpool of sin and
selfish pleasure?
Give me the first twelve years of
a child's life' once said a certain
priest, "and others may have
the remainder. In these twelve
years I will have so impressed and
stamped my own belief and convic
tions upon him that no one can
eliminate". This first impregna
tion of another's teaching does not
necessarily or always hold ttue f r
later instructions and a morcT ma
ture and analytical mind, a more
careful discrimination between right
and wrong, between the reasonable
and the absurd, a clearer insight
and understanding of life's true
meaning and proper relation and
duties to the world of humanity, may
change thfe whole fabric of former
instructions and beliefs, it remains a
psycological fact, an incontroverta
ble truth that early . impressions ar,(

later years attained. One day ' at
school his teacher was severely
chiding him for his laziness and
stupidity saying that no one could
ever teach him anything. A gen
tleman passing by just at that time,
on hearing the loud voice and angry
words of the schoolmaster, turned
his footsteps toward' the school,
house to investigate the trouble.
Learning the cause of the commo- .
tion he stepped to the side of the
lad and, laying , his haujj jgently on
the little boys s head, spoke to him
in words of kindness, telling him to
have, courage and not to give up,
there was yet great hope for him,
and that some day he might be a (
great scholar.'
And the possibilities suggested in
these timely and helpful words of
encouragement did come true as his
comentary on the Bible will show,
attaining high position in the church
and among men of learning. And
who can estimate fully the worth
of those words of encouragement
and hope upon that frightened and
discouraged child as he stood trem
bling and cowed in the presence of
his irate teacher ! We speak of
what Adam Clark has given to the
world. - but what of the stranger,
whose kindly spoken words and
gentleness to a little discouraged
child, like seed sown apparently in
barren soil, gave little promise of
the beautiful harvest that grew
from so unpromising planting !
