Ants That Sew.
A writer in the Visitor tells of a pa;
ty of German naturalists recently rc
turned from Ceylon, who have reported
the existence of a sjiecies of ant that
has been observed in the act of sewing
two leaves together for the purpose o'
forming a nest. This report confirms
the observations of the Euglish nat
uralist, Ridley, made in 1S!X). They
saw a row of the insects pulling the
edges of leaves together, tlieu others
trimming and fitting the edges and
finally the completion of the work by
still olher ants, which fastened the
edges with a silky thread yielded by
larvae of the same species, which the
workers carried in their mandibles. It
is said that the sewing ants pass
the thread-giving larvae like shuttles
through holes in the edges of the
lea v es. -

ROADS
AND FARMERS
Town and Country Should Work
For Setter Highways.
SCIENCE AND RURAL LIFE.
With the Improvement of Road Sys
tems the Monotony of Farm Life Will
Disappear and a New and Better Pay
Will Dawn For the Farmer.
With the advent of the auto and oth
er motor driven vehicles has come the
necessity both for the restoration of
abandoned towns and wayside inns
and neglected roads and for the crea
tion of new towns and hotels and high
ways, says Edwin Boone Craighead in
the New Northwest.
From every consideration for the
publie welfare, both the nation and
the state, the farmer and the towns
man should work together for the con
struction of a great system of nation
al and state and community highways,
connecting farms and towns and met
ropolitan cities and providing for a
safe and rapid means of transportation
alike for the husbandman, hurrying to
town with the perishable products of
farm and dairy and orchard, for the
physician making haste to reach his
country patient, for the children of
consolidated rural schools, as well as
for tourists bent ou beholding the won
ders and beauties of lakes and moun
tains. The making of good roads has
again become a national necessity.
With tile making of better roads
dawns a new and better day for the
farmer. "Back to the farm" has been
for a generation past the cry of the
statesman and the sociologist, but a
vain cry it has been, for always in
ever increasing numbers the children
of the country keep pouring into the
cities. Preaching alone will not turn

THE ADVENT OF THE A CTO.
the tide. The movement from farm to
town depends upon causes deep seated
as the longings and aspirations of men.
causes beyond the reach of the preach
er or tiie orator. As long as men love
the companionship of their fellow men.
so long wifi they and their children
turn from the loneliness and desola
tion of the Isolated farm to find fel
lowship in cities. As long as they
love life and laughter and song and
change, so long will they turn from
tiie deadening drudgery, the soul de
stroying monotony that lias hitherto
too often weighed down tiie hearts of
men and women and children on the
farm. Conditions so sad have not, of
course», been universal. In former
times ideal country communities there
were, with good roads and good schools
and good churches and abundant op
portuuity for social life. But with the
coining of the railroad men grew rest
less. Tlipy traveled, saw t lie world,
found the okl life in the country too
slow, moved to town, renting their
lands and leaving in still greater lone
liness their former friends and neigh
hors. But tiie tide is and for years in
some sections lias been turning, and
the movement back to the country is
and has been gaining ground. With
the construction of good roads, the de
velopment and extension of the tele
phone. the reduction in selling cost of
autos and trucks and motor propelled
vehicles of ever increasing variety and
adaptability to human needs: with the
improvement of farm machinery and
the application of science to the prob
lems of rural life, a day of imimagined
glory will soon dawn upon all tillers
of the soil wise enough to make use
of the new knowledge now so gener
ously spread abroad by the agricultur
al colleges and the experiment stations
of the states and of the national gov
eminent.
Road Building In Florida.
A scheme is on foot in Florida* to
build a brick road over tiie Everglades
gnd so connect the east and west
coasts. Within the next two years be
tween 1.100 and 1,200 miles of brick
highways now under construction will
be completed. About twenty counties
In Florida bave banded themselves to
ge-her and will expend from $10,000.
OOO to $12,000,000 for good roads. This
will give to tho tourist the advantage
of excellent motor trips in the winter.
WOMEN'S ROAD CREED.
Iowa Federation of Women's Clubs For
Improved Highways.
It is not left to man alone to cham
pion the cause of good roads, this be
ing indicated by the interest taken in
the subject at a recent meeting of the
Iowa Federation of Women's clubs.
This federation of women lias adopted
a good roads creed designed to advance
the cause of improved'highways. Fol
lowing Is the complete text of this
creed :
I believe in good roads.
I believe in systematic road work.
I believe good roads will make bet
ler schools.
I believe good roads Will make better
living conditions In tiie town and in
tiie country.
1 believe the women of Iowa should
enlist in the light for better roads
w hile we are here to use them.
I believe that tiie lust $50 spent upon
the proper finishing of a road will do
more good than any $100 that preced
ed It.
I believe that no road should be built
and allowed to take care of Itself.
There should be a system of road pa
trol.
1 believe that the weeds should be
cut along the roadside "and will use
every effort in my power to see that
the proper road officials have this done
if the landowner neglects to do It.
I believe no road work' should be
commenced that cannot he finished in
better shape than it was when It was
started. > ,
I believe in building roads, not work
ing them.
I believe in roads for women.
I will work for better roads for Iowa.
Too much enthusiasm ennnOt be work
ed up on the subject of' good roads.
Hoad improvement is generally advo
cated as an economic necessity be
cause it improves marketing facilities.
That it is a social necessity is indi
cated by the interest täten by this
body of women. It will 6e noted that
the "road patrol" system Is recommend
ed. Tills plan of road Improvement is
rapidly coming into favoje. It means
tiie placing of one individual in ebnrgç
of a given mileage of road, furnishing
him with drag and other road weapons.
What we are now spending on roads in
a hit or miss fashion would pay the
cost of the patrol, and unquestionably
if tiie new plan were tried-but it would
be a step in advance. *
These women show their.practical lu
sight in preparing their creed when
they refer to the weed question on the
roadsides. Their instinct for orderli
ness is shown here, and oflleers should
he shrewd enough to pay the fair sex
tiie compliment of giving heed to their
wise suggestions.—Iowa Homestead.
NEW YORK HIGHWAYS.
State Now Stands First |n Good Road«
Construction.
Its system of Improved, concreted
highways is New York state's greatest
asset today, asserts ex-State Highway
Commissioner John N. Carlisle in his
annual report for 1014, just issued.
Besides the direct value of the road
system to residents, the improved high
ways attracted nonresident automo
bile tourists in great numbers, con
servatively estimated at more than
250,000 cars, during the year, and mil
lions of dollars were left in the state
by these tourists.
The state now stands first in high
way construction, having completed
and accepted SGI miles of. road last
year and contracted for 1,148 miles, a
large amount of which is now open to
traffic. Fully half of the whole system
of nearly 12,000 miles of state and
county highway)* laid out for improve
ment under (iic $100,000,000 bond is
sues lias been < omplctcd. If extended
in a single line the finished roads
would reach from New York to 8au
Francisco.
Tiie policy of the department has
been to construct only heavy substan
tial roads in the vicinity of large cit
ies— either of brick or concrete or with
a concrete base and where stone roads
are designed to build them with very
heavy base. Nearly ninety-four miles
of concrete and more than eighty-one
miles of brick roads were built last
year. Just half of the total of SU3
miles improved were of bituminous
construction and 258 miles were wa
terbound macadam. Tiie maintenance
of the great system of macadam and
bituminous roads is now.eonsldered the
most intricate problem connected with
the state highway work.
State Control of Local Roads.
Tiie realization has become quite gen
eral that in order to render maximum
service state highway departments
should be given some measure of con
trol over the construction and main
tenance of local roads. For this class
of roads an amount exceeding $100,
000,000 is expended annually, with
comparatively little result to show in
the form of improved road mileage
for this great outlay. Tiie state of
Iowa lias met this situation by placing
all the road work in the state under the
direction of the state highway depart
ment.
Traffic is increasing so rapidly as to
cause excessive wear upon tiie roads,
especially in the vicinity of congested
centers of population. This results in
a heavy annual maintenance cost,
averaging in the large eastern states
not less than $750 per mile per annum.
Many experiments have been made in
the effort to devise types of road which
can be maintained at relatively low
cost. Tims far. aside from the cheaper
forms of construction, the states are
depending upon tiie various forms of
bituminous macadam, concrete and
vitrified brick road.—Year Book. Unit

MYSTERY OF THE MIND.
7ne of tho Great Riddles That Science
Cannot Solve.
Mind is the great unsolved mystery
>f science. No clew has been discov
ered as to what mind is, and yet sci
entists are ever striving to find some
:lew that will enable them to solve
this greatest of all mysteries.
A San Francisco correspondent asks
me the question:
"Since our state of temperament Is
subject to change from normal into
several different conditions, as sad,
glad, angry, happy, excited, etc., is it
the body that controls tho mind or
mind that controls the body?"
This Is an important question. In
mentologica! laboratories there have
been made in recent years extensive
researches. People have been tested
by delicate recording electrical Instru
ments. Questions have been asked
and statements made to these persons
and the action of mind on body de
tected by the apparatus. Increased
heart action or decreased nervous ten
sion change in bodily temperature,
pulse, respiration, aspects of the face,
eyes, lips--these and many more ef
fects have been studied and results re
corded in many books.
These are of great interest to detec
tives, courts and physicians.
Conversely, stimulation of nerves by
electricity, by Irritating drugs, me
rhanieal impacts und the like have
been made In all manner of ways.
The facts are that mind has a de
elded influence on brain, nerves, heart
and vital organs through the nerves.
Any manipulation of the body. nerv«»s
and circulator/ systems really pro
duces n reflex action on the mind.
The whole subject is obscure at pres
ent So inconceivably complex Is the
human organization that it may be n
number of years before all connections
between the personality ard body are
discovered, if. Indeed, they ever will
be detected. But no clew has been
discovered as to what mind is. This
is an impenetrable mystery In the
present state of mental science.—Ed
gar Lucien Larkin Id New York Amer
lean.
HOW TO SHAKE HANDS.
Get the Grip First, According to a Mer
cantile Recipe.
We have found that when you ap
proach the person to shake hands if
you will get the grip on their hand be
fore they have time to grip yours you
have gaiued au advantage. The hand
should be slipped well into or over the
hand of the person you want to shake
with—that is, push tiie thumb and fore
finger of your hand well into the
thumb and forefinger of the person
with whom yon are shaking. Do it
rather quickly, and the instant you
feel that your hand Is In place bring
the grip Into play instantly. Don't
grip the hand hard enough to cause
pain to the person with whom you ore
shaking, but yet give him a good, firm
grip. After you have practiced a lit
tle you can tell Just about how hard
you can squeeze without hurting the
other person
Before your hands touch be sure that
you are looking the other person square
In the eye. Don't wait until you have
hold of his baud, but watch his eye in
stantly. and if you will watch the eye
of the other one very closely you will
notice that when you bring the grip
into play you can see a response in the
features of the other person.
Then it is a good idea immediately
when you feel your hand touch tho
other person to place your left hand on
his elbow, not below the elbow, but
back of it so as to be able to pull his
arm. ns it were, toward yours. Don't
pull very hard, but just he firm about
it. Take hold of tiie elbow joint with
just a little firmness. Of course these
things are all done practically at the
same time, and It will toko a little
practice for you to he able to do this
and get the liest results.—Merchants'
Trade Review.
The Changing Sky.
One of the most surprising results
of the cross motion of the fixed stars,
as projected on the background of the
sky. is the gradual falling to pieces of
the familiar constellations. The stars
are moving in all sorts of directions,
some faster and some slower, and the
Inevitable consequence must lie that
In a few centuries the whole face of
the heavens will be so changed that
If we could come hack again to our
earthly life we should not recognize
them. Of course a very long period of
time will bo required to produce a very
great transformation.
Buried With Dalis.
In tiie Chinese morgue one of the
strange sights Is a number of life size
dolls ich are buried to accompany
the corpses as their servants to the
next world. They are doubtless a relic
of the time when human beings were
thus buried as companions of the de
ceased.—Exchange.

RED DESERT OF WYOMING.
Its Sand Dunes, Color Effects and
Sheep Pastures.
West of Creston is obtained the first
comprehensive view of the Ited desert
of Wyoming. A few miles north of the
railroad track is a great stretch of
sand dunes, which extends a hundred
miles, from Green river to North
Platte river. The dunes, many of
them more than a hundred feet high,
arc constantly traveling with the pre
vailing winds in a general easterly
direction. If a few camels and an
Arab or two were added to the scene
the spectator could easily imagine him
self In the Sahara desert. Frequent
mirages, endless variety of feature and
wonderful coloring make the desert
fnr from the monotonous stretch it
may seem to be at first glance.
As the name suggests, the dominant
colors nre red—russet, brick red and
vermilion—but there is every tone of
gray and brown, with not a few shades
of green, purple nnd yellow. Unlike
the colors of an eastern American land
scape. those of the Red desert are not
dependent on the season, for there is
little vegetation to hide the coloring of
the rocks and soil.
Despite the sparsity of vegetable
growth, the Red desert of Wyoming Is
winter sheep range. The scattered
bunch grass," which looks so meager
and dry, Is, la fact, excellent forage,
curing Into hay where it grew and hav
ing a high nutritive value. In sum
mer, when the desert is dry and the
water holes are few, the sheep are
herded iu the mountains, where water
is abundant and grass Is green and
tender.
The earlier snows, falling first in the
higher mountains and extending week
by week to lower altitudes, drive the
flocks into the rough fall range be
tween the mountains and the desert
Here they are held until the snow falls
on the desert itself, but with the first
heavy snowfall they are driven from
the foothills to spend the winter in the
open, whore they find pasture in the
spaces cleared of snow by the winds.
The winds are not tempered here, but
neither is the lamb shorn, and Wyo
ming winter winds make heavy wool
when shearing time comes.—Argonaut
FRIDAY HAPPENINGS.
They Register Many Important Event*
In American History.
Are you a good American and do yon
look on Friday as an unlucky day7
Y'ou are not superstitious anil are quite
sure that one day Is just like another
as far as national significance is con
cerned? No doubt that is true, and yet
the importance of Friday in American
history, as it has been worked out
makes an almost convincing showing
for itself. We have not forgotten that
Columbus discovered the new world on
Friday, Oct. 12, 1492. Did you know
that he also set sail ou the sixth day
of the week, that he started on his re
turn voyage on that day and that he
reached Palos on another Friday? In
addition to six vital ixilnts in the Co
lumbus exploration, which were mark
ed by Fridays, that day was carried
over into our national experiences with
England.
Cabot's commission from Henry VIII.
bears the date of Friday. On that day
of the week tho Mayflower landed, and
on a much earlier Friday the town of
St Augustine was founded. One G.
Washington was born on Friday, and
that day marked the seizing of Bunker
Hill, the surrender of Burgoyne at Sar
atoga, the discovery of Arnold's trea
son and the surrender of Lord Corn
wallis at Yorktown. This was In 1781,
almost fife long years after John
Adams made the famous motion in the
Continental congress that "the United
States are nnd ought to he independ
ent." That declaration was made on
Friday, the 7th of July, 1770, three
days after the actual drawing up of
tiie Declaration of Independence and
six years after the Boston massacre,
which precipitated the Revolution.—St
Louis Globe-Democrat.
A
The First Anthracite Coal.
When the first two tons of anthracite
coal were taken into Philadelphia in
18U8 the good people of that city, so the
records state, "tried to burn the stuff,
but at length, disgusted, they broke it
up nnd made a walk of it." Fourteen
years later Colonel George Shoemaker
sold eight or ten wagon loads of it in
the same city, hut warrants were soon
issued for his arrest for taking money
under false pretenses.
All but the Cover.
"Did you hear about Scribbles? The
police caught him walking out of a ho

CLOTHES IN CHINA
Where Women Wear Trousers
and Men Are Clad In Skirts.
A CURIOUS FASHION IN HAIR.
The Feminine Head Is Decorated With
a Stiff Cushion That Demands Con
stant Ventilation to Be Bearable.
Vogue of the Ear Tickler.
Even though I came to China know
ing that they did things backward,
there are some customs here that I
Just can't get used to. One is seeing
women wearing trousers. There are
more women wearing trousers In Chi
nn than there nre people iu the United
States—men, women and children. I
suppose there is no reason why things
shouldn't be thus, but it will always
seem to me that the liants are on the
wrong side of the house.
The women look like clothespins.
Their bodies are the same size ull the
way down, and their feet are so tiny
that they go bobbing along for all the
world like jointed clothespins. The
women shave their foreheads, with
the timber line almost at the top of
their heads, so thnt the little patch of
face below looks as If it were trem
bling under threat of an Impending
snowslide.
Their hair Is pulled and keyed hack
ns though for musical purposes. At
the back of the head a Chinese wo
man wears a cushion of false hair, so
dressed as to show her rank, so that a
person skilled In the language <>f the
hair can read her history, can tell her
present plans nnd her future ambi
tions. A person tip on hair can tell at
a glance whether or not she is mar
ried; If so, how many children she lias,
and if a widow, if she is willing to
open correspondence with a desirable
party of about forty-five—object, mat
rimony.
In this cushion a Chinese woman
carries her head serateber. Her hair
dressing Is a preparation made of slip
pery elm. The person needing it can
run out to the corner and wait until
the carpenter takes a plane and shaves
off a few curls. This the Chinese lady
steeps into a thick, gummy smear,
pours it on her head ami uses it to
stiffen her hair.
This layer makes the top of her head
hot, so that every odd moment when
'•sbff't&sn't anything else fo dcAfie gets
down under the mess and lets in some
air with a darning needle. Her favor
ite time for doing this is at the theater.
When the performance begins to drag
she gets out her darning needle and
improves the shining hour by making a
rift in the roof as she looks around
over the audience, lightly gossiping
about who are there, wlmt they are
wearing and how awful they look.
Men in Chinn wear skirts. Their
skirts nre in a garment that reaches
from their shoulders to their shins and
looks like a nightgown worn by a Cape
Cod deacon. It has a tasty slit up each
side, so that on mmldv crossings the
twinkle of masculine ankles may lie
seen. When they want to catch a car .
they have to gather up their skirts in
tiie good old fashioned feminine way.
Under their skirts they wear a pair
of drawers fastened at the ankles with
a bandage, with the ends tucked in.
When a Chinaman has an important
letter or note to carry he unties the leg
of his drawers, stuffs it in and puts the
bandage back. The bandage works
loose, so that when he reaches his des
tination the note Is usually gone.
The only pockets a Chinaman has are
in his shirt waist, which lie wears un
der his skirt, so that when he wants to
get a dime he has to unbutton one side
and slip in a hand. Even though a
Chinaman wears skirts he has not yet
learned about the First National hank.
The Chinese are a great nation to
think of the hnmly little things—things
that no other jieople in the world could
possibly think of. You can run out on
to the street almost any time and buy
an ear tickler. Men make a living
going around selling them. An ear
tickler Is a little puff of cotton on the
end of a stick and Is meant to combine
both business and pleasure— tlie busi
ness of cleaning the ear and the pleas
ure of the tickling sensation.
His is not an easy life, for the ped
dler has to be constantly on the watch
against tricky people who come up,
sample his ticklers, give their ears a
couple of good tingles, tell the man
that they don't like his brand of tick
ler and go on their way.
The peddler's ingenuity has devel
oped a way of polishing up the tickler
that the next possible purchaser
may not know that the tickler has been
