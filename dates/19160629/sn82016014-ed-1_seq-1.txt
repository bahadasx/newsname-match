It is sweeping over Topeka and

start an insurrection here hundreds
of miles north of the border and Villa.
cr.s of guns and rifles have been

Two hundred Mexicans met In Little

This morning there was a report
that a Mexican had attempted to poi

The head of the department was
confronted.
"Oh. yes." he paid, "heard some
thing about that the other day. In

hundred times in the last year.
"Seriously, the Mexicans here are
trustworthy. They have no desire to

NEGRO TROOPERS
REACHED EL PASO
AT NOON TODAY
Brought by Guards From Chi
huahua on Trains.
Nearly Naked and Wear Many
Bandages.
TRAIN WAS LONG DELAYED
Large Crowd Awaited Arrival
Fire Hours.
24 Mne, Including Mormon
Scout, Delivered to Gen. Bell.
El Paso, June 29. Twenty-three
negro troopers of the Tenth cavalry,
and Lera Spillsbury, Mormon scout,
captured by the Mexicans at Carrizal
and subsequently confined in the Chi
huahua penitentiary, were brought to
the border at noon today to be turned
over to the American military author
ities. A shout of laughter arose from the
thousands of Juarez Mexicans who
had gathered to witness the arrival
as the negroes filed from the special
train. The prisoners were dressed in
the scantiest and most nondescript
garb. Some had on only trousers. One
wore a shirt, while a towel encircled
his waist. Others' heads were deco
rated with bandages.
Spillsbury was dressed in a white
duck suit. He appeared anxious. All
the troopers looked worn and drawn
from their experience, and all were
serious save one., who wore a broad
smile. This one made himself the
i impromptu spokesman of his fellows.
1 "We sure are glad to get back," he
said.
Juarez Commander There.
Gen. Francisco Gonzales. Juarez
commander, and Andres Garcia, Mexi
can consul in El Paso, met the train.
General Gonzales boarded the train.
A minute later he reappeared, fol
lowed by the guards that had escorted
the prisoners from Chihuahua.
The guards, dressed in uniforms of
bright yellow, pushed back the crowd,
forming a lane through which Stills
bury and the troops marched down
the railway tracks. They were taken
to the disinfecting plant and there
stripped and treated before being es
corted to the commandancia.
Unexpected slowness of the special
train bearing them from Chihuahua
delayed transfer to the American side ;
of prisoners. On announcement that !
the train would arrive early in the
morning a big crowd gathered at the
American end of the international
bridge to greet the returning negro
troopers of the Tenth cavalry and
Lent H. Spillsbury, Mormon scout.
Moving picture machines were set
up and the escort for the returning
captives provided by General George
Bell, Jr., marched to the bridge at 8
o'clock. The crowd sweltered under
the hot sun.
Cause of Delay Not Announced.
Shortly after 11 o'clock General
Gonzales said he had received a tele
gram stating that the special train
would not arrive until 12:30 or 1
o'clock. The cause of the delay was
not explained.
Gen. Pablo Bertani, recent Car
ranza commander at Casas Grandes
and later at Madera, is in charge of
the prisoners train.
Pending the arrival and transfer of
the prisoners to the American side
traffic between Juarez and El Paso
was stopped and other steps were tak
en to prevent any disorder.
Shortly before g o'clock an escort
for the prisoners arrived at the
American end of Santafe street, it
consisted of a detachment of the
Twentieth infantry and a provost
guard. The throng that gathered on
the American side was composed
largely of Mexicans. Several hundred
Mexicans also stationed themselves at
the other end of the bridge.
At 9 o'clock the Mexican consulate
announced that the special train had
been delayed and the prisoners would
not arrive before 10:30 a. m. Further
delay was announced later.

ROOSEVELT WILL
TAKE THE STUMP
TO HELPHUGHES
Colonel Will Probably Make
Six Speeches for Him.
First To Be at Big Madison
Square Garden Rally.
HARMONY DINNER SUCCESS
Leaders Get Together on All
Important Questions.
Hughes Is Greatly Elated Over
T. R.'s Support.
New York, June 29. At the con
clusion of the Roosevelt-Hughes har
mony dinner here Colonel Roosevelt
announced, that with the opening of
the campaign he will take the stump
for the Republican candidate.
The colonel plans to make four or
five speeches at such times and places
as Mr. Hughes and his campaign
manager indicate. It is believed that
the first of these speeches will be
made at a great rally in Madison
Square Garden, at which not only Col
onel Roosevelt, but former President
William H. Taft and Hughes as well
will be present.
Harmony pervaded every nook and
corner of the Astor hotel following
the epoch-making dinner which ce
mented the reunion of the Republic
ans and the prodigal Progressives.
Colonel Rooseve.t was all smiles. Mr.
Hughes beamed his satisfaction and
came all the way down from the
eighth floor with the colonel and es
corted him out to his waiting motor
car when the dinner and confab were
at an end.
Hughes Highly Pleased.
With the departure of the colonel.
Mr. Hughes said:
"I was very much pleased with Col
onel Roosevelt's letter of indorsement
and he has expressed himself in a very
kindly way with respect to my tele
gram to the Progressive committee. I
wanted to talk to Colonel Roosevelt
fully with respect to the issues of the
campaign and asked him to dine with
me so that we might have that oppor
tunity. He dined with me and we had
a very delightful interview. We talked
very fully on all matters and are in
complete accord. The evening has
been a very pleasant one."
Returning at once to the Hotel
Langham after the dinner. Colonel
Roosevelt said to a reporter that he
had a most satisfactory talk with Mr.
Hughes and was really very greatly
pleased. The colonel said he most
heartily agreed with the attitude Mr.
Hughes takes toward the great ques
tions that are up for issue and assured

KANSAS GUARDS
Question of Ballot for Nominees
While Out of State.
Brewster Sues J. T. Botkin to
Find Out.
ASKS FOR MANDAMUS WRIT
2800 Guardsmen May Be Barred
From Primary Polls.
Decision in Case Is Expected
Next Month.
Rights of Kansas national guards
to vote in the primaries while in the
service of the government on the
Mexican border, will be determined in
a friendly suit filed today by S.. M.
Brewster, attorney general. The suit
is an application for a writ of man
damus against J. T. Botkin. secretary
of state, filed in the supreme court.
The suit seeks to compel Botkin to
prepare the necessary papers for the
voting of Kansas national guardsmen
in the August primaries. There is a
question as to the right of guardsmen
to participate in the primaries while
beyond the boundaries of the state.
This question will be settled in the suit
now before the courts.
Section 3154 of the general statues
of Kansas provide that soldiers or
militiamen while in the service of the
state or federal government may vote
for state and district officers. There
is a question, however, concerning the
application of this law to the pri
maries. Maybe the law doesn't mean
a vote in a primary is a vote for a
state or district officer, since the can
didate Is merely nominated at that time.
There is no question concerning the in
terpretation of the law as apolied to
the general election.
In November Kansas guardsmen
may vote lor state and district and
national officers while in service. But
a vote in the primaries may be quite
different. AH members of the Kansas
National Guard are to be transported
to Eagle Pass. Texas, according to
plans announced by the federal gov
ernment. They will be outside the bor
ders of the state and not subject to
provisions of the absent voter law. The
suit before the supreme court will test
the right of the guardsmen to vote
while In the government service and
outside the boundaries of the state. A
decision in the case will be had in
July.

BEHIND HIM
LAW ISJJPHELD
Commission Men Must Pay LI-
cense Fee to State.
Must Also Give a Bond for Good
Behavior.
In a decision today, the Kansas su
preme court upheld the constitution
ality of the commission merchant act,
enacted In 1915. The court holds that
all commission firms must provide a
surety bond as protection against dis
honest dealings and must pay the state
an. annual license of $10. Nearly 400
Kansas firms are affected by the deci
sion. The commission merchant law,
known as the Resler act, was passed
by the state legislature in 1915. It
was enacted as a safeguard to the pro
ducer against dealings of dishonest
commission merchants. The law pro
vided a penalty of from $10 to $500
for deception in grading or weighing
of grain or produce. Nearly a year
ago the legal points surrounding the
act were taken to the courts.
'Commission merchants sought to
have the law held discriminatory and
unconstitutional. They failed to com
ply with the act and less than twenty
five firms have paid their fees. The
decision of the court today, however,
will force all commission firms to
come under the law. They must pay
their fees and provide their bonds
in the next few days. The new fiscal
year begins July 1 and at that time
all fees lor the ensuing year are due.
Enforcement of the law-is under the
stale board of agriculture. When the
law was enacted Secretary J. C. Mohler
-ought protection against personal lia
bility and a test case concerning the
operation of the law was filed In the
supreme court. The court in upholding
the act declared it was a just protection
to the producer against unfair deal
ings by commission merchants. To
come under the law, firms -must pay
the state an annual license fee of $10
and must spend an extra $10 for a
$2,500 surety bond as protection to the
producer against unfair, or dishonest
acts. The law provides a penalty in
case of violation and also affords re
lief to the producer.
Justice John Marshall dissented in
part when the decision was prepared.
His dissent covered a portion of the
decision concerning the right of re
view in case of complaint.

The reply itself has not been com

note is in reality not an answer at all,
but a series of charges, he said.

ments. The American note and the
reply will be given to the public here

Referring later on in his address to
the possibilities of armed conflict, Car

'Mexico is the guardian of this rare.
We must defend not only the sov

(Evidently the fact that General
Trevino ordered the release of the

It was stated, however, that the

Loyalty to Country a Crime in
So Other Place.
This Was Casement's Answer
to Death Sentence Today.
BT WILBUR S. FOREST.
London, June 29. Found guilty of
the crime of high treason and about
to be sentenced to death. Sir Roger
Casement, once brilliant Irish leader,
made an impassioned speech as he
stood in the prisoner's dock before
Lord Chief Justice Reading this aft
ernoon. "In England alone in the twentieth
century, loyalty to one's country Is
held to be a crime," he said, with a
dramatic gesture.
"If it is treason to fight under such
conditions, then I am proud to be a
rebel."
Unnerved, by Verdict.
Casement was unnerved when he
heard the word "guilty." He started,
as if to rise from his seat, fell back,
and finally succeeded in getting to his
feet to address the court. He support
ed himself by resting one hand on his
chair, but his body rocked violently.
His voice quavered so that his re
marks were barely heard.
"What I have to say,' ne sal a. nis
voice steadying for the moment, "is
intended for my own countrymen."
As he continued, he gained his
composure. He seemed perfectly
calm as he protested against condi
tions in Ireland and declared he
should have been tried by an Irish
jury. He stood erect and smiling
when the lord chief justice, as Case
ment finished his address, pronounced
the sentence- that he should "hang by
the neck until dead." There was ut
ter silence in the court room as the
prisoner stepped down from the dock
and left the .court room at once.
Bailey Discharged.
Immediately after Casement was led
away, the case against Daniel Bailey,
the Irish soldier who landed with
Casement from a German submarine,
was called. Bailey was arraigned with
Casement at the preliminary hearing
in Bow street police court and gave
important evidence for the crown.
When the case was called. Lord
Chief Justice Reading instructed the
Jury to return a verdict of acquittal,
and declared the -defendant's dis
charge. Leniency in the case of Bai
ley was expected because he had made
a full confession to the police immedi
ately after his arrest.
An appeal will be taken by Sir
Roger, it was announced.
RELEASE "
TROOPERS
RELIEVES
SITUATION
Carranza Orders Trevino Free
American Prisoners.
Official Confirmation Received
at Washington Today.
WAY NOW OPEN FOR MEDIATION
Believe Mexico Ready to Yield
Further Demands.
"o Let-Up in Rushing Stat
Troops to Border.
Washington, June 29. Official an
nouncement of General Carranza's or
der for the release of the American
troopers captured at Carrizal reached
the state department early today from
Special Agent Rodgers at Mexico City.
When he sent the message last night
Mr. Rodgers expected to be handed s
reply to the American note at. any mo
ment. Mexican Ambassador Arredondo to
day received a message from Foreign
Minister Aguilar confirming that First
Chief Carranza had issued orders to
General Trevino to release the Ameri
can troopers captured at Carrizal and
since held prisoners at Chihuahua
City.
Mr. Arredondo said his information
was that General Carranza had rei
leased the prisoners "because he did
not desire to aggravate the relations
between the two countries." Mr. Ar
redondo issued the following statement
understood to be based largely on the
language of his dispatch from Mexico
City:
"I have been confident from the
first that the American soldiers would
be released. From the time of their
capture until arrangements were made
to free them there was at no time any
other intention on the part the de
facto government or its military of
ficial. The attitude of the first chief
hag been one of friendship towards the
United States, prompted always by a
desire to avoid conflict and promots
the welfare of both governments. In
the situation that exists it should be
borne In mind that it has not been
brought about by any act which could
be attributed either to the government
or the Mexican people but is due en
tirely to the predetermined intentions
of an irresponsible criminal."
Grave Possibilities Remain.
Release of American troopers at
Carrizal has removed one dangerous
element in the Mexican situation but
it was apparent today that it had only
somewhat relieved and had not re
moved the grave menace to contin
uance of friendly relations between
the United States and the Mexican de
facto government. By freeing tha
prisoners Carranza met only one de
mand made by President Wilson. The
other that Carranza declare his future
attitude toward the American forces
in Mexico remains unanswered, until
the latest communication arrives from
Mexico City.
On the contingency that the Car
ranza government may maintain its
policy of attacking American forces
moving in any direction except north,
activities looking toward speedy trans
portation cf national guardsmen to
the border showed no relaxation to-
There were two hopeful factors In
the situation, however.
First Whatever General Carranza
answer may be. It probably will re
quire further diplomatic conversations
and thus hostilities may be averted
at least temporarily.
Second Many observers were In
clined to believe that the yielding of
the Mexican government In the case
of the prisoners indicates a tendency
which may be reflected in further
Influence on Carranza.
The condition under which the
United States government had re
fused to consider mediation also is re
moved with the freeing of the troop
ers Minister Calderon of Bolivia had
an engagement with Secretary Lansing
to discuss the Latin-American offers
to assist in arbitrating the dispute
It is believed considerable influence
must have been exerted on General
Carranza by South American govern
ments. Americans interested in Invest
ments in Mexico and Mexican labor
leaders, who conferred with President
Gompers of the American Federation
of Labor, yesterday. President Gom
pers sent a message to General Car
ranza personally appealing for action
to prevent a break.
One American company with Inter
ests in Mexico is reported to have
spent several hundred dollars on
cablegrams and telegrams to de facto
government officials during the last
few days.
President Wilscn considered the sit
uation sufficiently relieved today to

fight is expected to have no effect on
troop movements to the border. Army
officers today felt that while an actual
clash has been averted temporarily
the situation between the United
States and Mexico will continue to be
strained until General Carranza defi
nitely declares his attitude toward
American foops in Mexico.
The war department has been asked
by General Funston to expedite th
