Shall We Have War?
The militia has bern called out. Men who enlisted
with little thought of war are summoned to put on their
uniforms, drop their business, and leave home for the
camp and perhaps for the battlefield.
We do not understand President Wilson's plans, nor
know the reasons for his actions. We could see no pur
pose in the occupation of Vera Cruz, and we see no end
to be accomplished by landing and keeping troops in
Mexico. Of course we are justified all right, by the things
the Mexicans have done; but still we see no good to come
from our actions unless it be to get more of our men ac
customed to warlike maneuvers.
But we do believe that it is for the interest of Presi
dent Wilson to preserv e his great record as a peacemaker.
And we believe that at heart he desires peace. And
America is too great, too sane, too sure to get all that jus
tice demands in the end, to be hurried into a war.
The Soldier's Danger
The real danger to our"soldier boys" is not from Mex
ican bullets or any hostile armies. Their real dauger is
from the temptations and corruptions of the camp.
Every camp is the focus for work by all the devil's
missionary societies, -tobacco, drinkgambling, women,
profanity. Few officers oppose these things, and some
encourage and set the example of free indulgence.
Christian people should be active to know the condi
tions and provide all the moral sanitation possible. The
camp is often more deadly than the battle-field.
: Madison and Rockcastle
Neighboring counties can often greatly help or hind
er 01 another. The new Dixie Highway will bind coun
ties together in a very delightful way.
The great meeting at llerea on Tuesday was a fine
example. The judges and prominent men of both coun
ties were present, and agreed to meet one month hence,
Thursday, July 27, on the top of Scaffold Cane Hill to be
gin work on the great Dixie Highway which is not pnly
tp be. a thoroughfare for people from the far North and
South, but the path for traffic and many a friendly visit
between the two counties.
"Good friends make good neighbors"1 is an old say
ing, but a newer and a better saying is ,"Ob6d roadways
make good neighbors." ,,f "
WIAT CAR BE DONE FOR THE
BLINDED IN THIS WAR
Tin" aim of Tlie Permanent Wind Re
lief War Fund of 590 Fifth Ave, New
York, ran be stated in a very few
words. It is proved to create
through the generosity, sympathy,
and benevolence of the American
people, a lasting and practical me
morial to the brave young soldiers
and sailor who have become blind
ed in the service of their country.
These men, plunged suddenly into
total darkness, are dependent at
present on the existing institutions
for the care of the blind, which are,
owing to the exigencies of this war.
completely inadequate.
Tie first object of this Fund will
b to enable these institutions to en
large their possibilities by provid
ing increased accommodations, ad
ditional teachers, mechanical appli
ance, etc, so that they may be bet
ter able to cope with the ever-increasing
demand upon their care
and help.
Furthermore, it is proposed to
build permanent homes, workshops
and exchanges whereby the work of
these blinded men may be brought
Into a favorable and paying market
It has already been proven that
certain arts and trades are of espe
cial adaptability to the blind. They
learn such work as carpentry, boot
repairing, mat-making, basket-making,
weaving, mattress making.

Once these stricken men are made
to realize that there is still some
thing left for them in life, that by
their own work they ran still hold a
place among their fellow-men, they
lose the terrible depression natur
ally following their misfortune and
set cheerfully to work to become
once more useful members of the
community.
In order to accomplish this result,
large sums of money, intelligently
expended, are required. It is easy
to understand that the blind worker
at home can accomplish but little
if left to himself.
