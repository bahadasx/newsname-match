ORRIIV L.
, Orrln L. MuDger of Piedmont is a
candidate for the Democratic nomi
nation for Congress and bis formal
announcement of that fact appears in
The Times this week.
Mr. Munger is not unknown, to our
people, for he partially received his
education in Farmington at Carleton
College. That was a number of years
ago, since which time he has grad
ually been climbing the ladder of suc
cess as a lawyer of recognized hon
esty and integrity as well as ability,
and has won credit as a faithful ser
vant of the people in the capacity of
Prosecuting Attorney of his county
(Wayne) and other responsible pub
lic positions. It is at the earnest so
licitation and encouragement of many
friends in different parts of the dis
trict, coupled with a commendable
ambition to enter public fife, that he
has decided to ask the Democrats of
the Thirteenth District to honor him
with the nomination for their Repre
sentative hi Congress. And it is not
as an amateur in public affairs that
he enters upon this course. He has
been a close and observant student
of public questions, and as an earnest
adherent to the underlying principles
of the Democratic party has often
done good and effective campaign
work for his party. , .
Mr. Munger is not a diletante in
any sense of the meaning. His life
has been one of hard work with a
definite purpose iu view. Asi a boy
and young man be has labored with
The New Arcadia Heights.
The improvements constructed dur
ing the last seven years have trans
formed our once rugged mountain top
into a convenient Summer Assembly
ground. Rugged it still is, wildly
picturesque, with its rocks add forests.
, But buildings, waterworks, and
athletic equipment have made it a
pleasant home for -people who are
need to the ordinary conveniences - of
life. Ample provision has been made
for a wellrounded social life on the
Heights. The new B. Y. P. U. Pavilion
provides an ideal place for class room
work as well as for social gatherings.
If there should be any rainy after
, noons, come and join the social crowd
about the open fire-place in the Pa
vilion for a cheery social time. You
- will learn to know the best souls in
the Master's work in an intimate way,
through associating with them here
' on the Heights,
-'There are wonderful sunsets at Ar
cadia Heights. Nature seemed to ex
, ert herself to throw in qnlck succes-
si on on the sky canvas behind old
Pilot Enob and Shepherd Mountain
her most gorgeous color pictures for
the inspiration Of appreciative souls.
Perhaps the most vivid and , mo9t
sacred memories of the life at Arcadia
Heights are connected with Sunset
Rock. The people gather at the rock
at sunset, and with faces turned to
ward the setting sun, they sing and
pray and tell each other what Christ
- means to them.
An onlooker might f say, "Surely
there is more light in the faces of the
-1 people than that reflected by the dy
ing sun," and another who had been
there and knew might answer, "Yos,
there is also a radiation from within
from the Sun of Righteousness." The
glow Is still in their faces as the
people wend their way op the paths
toward the Tabernacle for the even
ing service, and their minds and souls
are wide open to receive the great
messages there because they have
been communing with God In one of
his most wonderful nature temples,

Burk & Hobbs at Farmington.
(Farmington News.)
The' Bnrk-HobSs revival is on in
earnest and prior to last night, when
the storm rained the meeting out, all
services had been largely attended.
It was decided yesterday that an ad
dition to the tabernacle would be ab
solutely necessary, bringing the seat
ing capacity up to 2,000. The addition
will be completed by Sunday.
Rev. Burk is preaching some won
derful sermons. Those who arev at
tending are almost with one accord
praising the meeting. Sunday nfghta
large audience heard Burk's great
sermon on "Prayer," such an lmpor
tant factor In a revival effort."
Monday night his subject was
"Love," He showed how the absence
of Qod's love in a man's heart ac
counts for his meanness and inferior
ity, of prestige; "You cannot be a
good father, an ideal mother, a worthy
citizen without the love of God in
your heart," he asserted. '
"Is Your Life Worth Living" was
the topio of, Rev. Burk's discourse
Tuesday night. The righteous man
was pointed out as the one whose life
is worth living."
Wednesday night his subject was
"What Must I Do To Be Saved."
Prof. Harry Dixon Loes, of Chicago,
has charge of the music Under his
able leadership a choir of 200 or more
Is being organized, and great things
are expected from this department of
the work. Mr. Loea has readily de
monstrated his cleverness as a soloist
and chorister. He Is a graduate of
Moody Institute, Chicago, and has
studied music at other colleges. All
who are willing to offer their help
in the choir are urged to take a place
with the singers, - ,
Mr. Loei has an enviable reputation
as a singer and composer. He 'has
written about 600 gospel songs, words
and music. Some of the songs he will
asa in the tabernacle are of his own
composition.
An interesting feature of the meet
ing Is the Sunshine Junior Choir of
boys and girls, who occupy the front
seats of the center section. Their
happy participation in song is inspir
ing. Five-Acre Cora Contest
Four hundred and eight of the
farmers who entered in the 1915 In
diana 5-acre corn contest completed
the work. Their average yield was
66.1 bushels per acre, at an average
of $14.81, or 21.1 cents per bushel.
These contestants represented 23
counties. The agent in each county
had immediate charge of the work,
but the State college furnished a judge
to assist in determining the yield and
cost. One contestant produced 105.4
bushels per acre and 10 produced from
90 to 100 bushels. The 11 highest con
testants averaged 93.4 bushels per
acre, at an average cost of $15.23, or
16.2 cents per bushel. The yields
were determined on a basis of air-dried
corn, the weight being reduced to a
moisture content of 15.5 per cent.
The Ozark Trail.
(The De Soto Republican.)
The Commercial Club of De Soto
is taking up the Ozark Trail prop
osition and will send James Q. Berke
ley to Springfield next Monday to
represent the Olub in a meeting to be
held In that city, looking to the es
tablishing of the trail and building a
rock road over it to Potosi and thence
to De Soto.
It seems that the road has been es
tablished as far as Salem, in Dent
county, and that an effort is now be
ing made to have it bnilt to Bismarck
instead of Potosi, which is in direct
line and exactly on the trail.
Ward Cunningham, president of the
Commercial Club, is pushing the mat
ter, with the hope that De Soto will
eventually be an objective point and
that we will benefit by the Btate aid
to be given in the building of the
Ozark road.-
The history of the old trail is well
known to the pioneers of the county,
but the younger class know very little
about it and the part it played in the
early development of the country.
It was traversed in the early days by
the Indians crossing the country and
was later used by the early settlers in
passing from one point to another.
Long before DeSoto was ever thought
of the pioneers traveled from Potosi,
Herculaneum aad Si.e. Genevieve to
St. Louis over the old King's Trace,
which passed about where De Soto
now stands.
It is the purpose of the Ozark Trail
Association to re-establish some of
these trails and have good, substantial
rock roads built over them. The
Legislature has appropriated money
to be used in that way. ,
If the Ozark Trail is built to Potosi
it will then be bought to De Soto,
crossing Big River at a point near
Eggers ford. From here to St.Louis
the road is already complete.
Mr. Cunningham, in speaking of the
matter, said that the Club thought it a
good idea to investigate the building
of the road and if possible have it
pasa thru our city, as it would open
up some splendid.territory south of U8,
besides bringing hundreds of visitors
to De Soto.

Prepare Drive on Hessian Fly.
"The most gigantic drive that has
ever been delivered against the Hes
sian fly is now being prepared by Mis
souri farmers in every wheat growing
county of the Sfate," says T. J, Tal
bert, assistant professor of Horti
culture at the University of ' Missouri
at Columbia. Accoiding to Mr. Tal
bert, the fly Is now entrenched In the
flaxseed and magot stage between the
leaf sheath and stalk at the bottom of
the wheat plant. The enemy will re
main In this position until fall, thus
providing the farmer an opportunity
to deal him an effective blow at his
weakest point.
During the months of July, August
and September the trenches of the
Hessian fly. can easily be taken with
out artillery preparation. As soon as
practical after harvest, the "farmer
Will advance in the open to the first
line trenches In the wheat stubble
fleldtand by the nse of the disc, har
row and drag be will bury the enemy
deeply beneath the soil.
In order to make the destruction of
the enemy complete, his food suppy
must be cnt off. This can be done by
discing and harrowing the plowed
gronnd to keep down volunteer
wheat.
The fly will make his general at
tack npon the fall wheat during Sep
tember and October after which he
will take his encampment for the win
ter at the base of the wheat plants.
As the life of the fly is ohy f onr or five
days in the adult stage during which
time the eggs are deposited on the
wheat leaves, it is advisable to sow
the wheat late enough to escape the
egg-laying of the main fall brood of
flies.
The fly free dates for Missouri are
about as follows: For northern third
of State, October 1; central third,
October 3; southern third, October 16.
If the fly is allowed to intrench him
self in early wheat and volunteer
wheat in the summer and fall, he may
emerge the following spring in num
ber sufficient to do great harm to
date. To make a successful tight
against the enemy, co-operation is
necessary and cannot be too strong
