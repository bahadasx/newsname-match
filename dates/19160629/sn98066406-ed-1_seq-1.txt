Work of County Agriculturist
No other period of equal length since
county agent work was resumed in St.
Clair county has been so full of interest
or progress as last week. It might very
properly be termed "canning week,"
for while other important functions
claimed attention, more time was de
voted to the canning demonstrations
than to any other single project. That
these demonstrations made the day a
red letter one for the ladies in the com
munities where they were held, was
surely evidenced by the interest and
attendance shown. Where an attend
ance of ten or twelve was looked for,
thirty or more women turned out, and
where twenty to thirty were expected,
attendance totalled lrom fifty to sixty.
The campaign was started Monday af
ternoon with a meeting at the 'home of
Mrs. John Patterson iu Columbus
township. This was followed on Tues
day with meetings at Mrs. William
Campbell's of Lynn township in the
morning, and Huston Hall, Alleuton,
in the afternoon. And Wednesday
morning the project was continued at
the China Gleaner Hall. The technical
part of the work was in charge of Miss
Paulina Baven of the Home Economies
Department of the Michigan Agricul
tural College, and the efficient manner
in which she handled it afforded a
splendid example of what experience
built upon thorough scientific training
can accomplish.
Wednesday afternoon the June meet
ing of the China Farmers' Club was at
tended at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
Peter Theison, where a talk was given
regarding the "State Milk Producers'
Organization," and Co-operative JJreed
er's Associations."
Thursday was spent with the Uolum
bus-Bichmond Club at the home of
Mrs. Ida Quick in Columbus township.
The part taken in the discussion was
a discussion of the "Relation of the
County Agent Movement to Rural
Progress." The matter of holding a
one-week school next winter was also
considered, and a committee was ap
pointed to make arrangements.
Friday was occupied with a meeting
at a picnic in' Sanilac county, four
miles west of Deckerville, where "Some
of the Important Factors in the Devel
opment of Country Life" was discussed.
Leaders in Sanilac county are becom
ing much Interested In the county
agent movement aud this phase of the
subject seemed to be specially well re
ceived. It affords much satisfaction to
help outside counties that are strug
gling to get started in the work and it
is believed, too, that such trips occas
ionallv will serve to Impress them that
St. Clair, while It may have some nat
ural disadvantages, is keeping abreast
of the times and is in the front rank
with the most progressive counties of
the state.
The next extension worker who will
be in the county will be O. B. Cook,
Assistant State Leader of County
Agents, who comes during the week
beginning with July 3d, in answer to a
number of requests for assistance along
drainage lines. He will be followed
later in the month by J. II. Carmody,
one of the Agricultural ' College Held
agents, who will give some spraying
and thinning demonstrations.

Fred J. Wilt's Delivery Day
Saturday, July 1st, is the date set
for Fred J. Wilt's annual sale and de
livery day. The present Indications
promise that this event will be a big

dict a much bigger sale and delivery

MORE MEN THAN WOMEN
HAVE APPENDICITIS
Surgeons state men are slightly more
subject to appendicitis than women.
Yale people should know that a few
doses of simple buckthorn bark, gly
cerine, as mixed In Adler-i-ka, often
relieve or prevent appendicitis. This
mixture removes such surprising foul
matter that ONE SPOONFUL relieves
almost ANY CASE constipation, sour
stomach or gas. The INSTANT, easy
action of Adler-1-ka Is surprising.
