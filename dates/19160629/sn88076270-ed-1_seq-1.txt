VOL. XXII, NO. 2.
RETURNS INCOMPLETE:
BIG BUCK VOTE
RESULTS OF YESTERDAY'S PRI
MARIES NOT YET CONCLU
SIVELY KNOWN
Burdick Made Wonderful Run But
May Be Beaten By Townley's
Man
At five p. m. yesterday the most in
teresting primary election ever held
in North Dakota closed. The results
are not known, at the hour of going
to press, on the more closely contest
ed offices such as governor and U. S.
senator but bulletins from Fargo at
noon indicate that matters are badly
mixed. The league organized by C.
A. Townley and his solicitors nave
nominated some of it's men while in
other cases the regular republican
candidates have won.
It is probable that Frazier, the
league leader's choice, has been nom
inated over Usher L. Burdick of this
city. Firazlier was backed by un
limited funds and the most efficient
political machine North Dakota has
ever seen. Burdick, with a campaign
fund that kept strictly within the lim
its, and handicapped by two lessor
candidates who split up the regular
republican strength, made a magnifi
cant race. If he is beaten it is be
cause of the registering as republi
cans of thousands of socialists and
democrats as republican.
On the face of returns received at
Fargo up to three p. m. today Frazier
seemed likely to win by 3,000 but re
turns from the western part of the
state were swelling the Burdick col
umn. The Frain vote showed even
lighter than expected but is sufficient
to be responsible for the socialistic
success if success it proves to be.
U. S. Senate^
L. B. Hanna is the winner in Wil
liams county but is probably beaten
by McCumber in the state, with Nes
tos third.
Below are some precinct figures and
totals for 26 precincts in Williams
county. What the remaining 40 pre
cincts will show is uncertain. The
vote in general was not as heavy as
expected on account of heavy storms
that prevailed in many parts.
Stony Creek, Burdick's farm home
precinct, cast a solid republican vote
for him.

Williston Remembered
By the Hill Family
Williston will receive two gifts from
the Hill family as mementos of the
late James J. Hill. A large portrait
of the Empire Builder is now being
prepared and will be presented to the
James Memorial Library in this city
by Louis Hill, president of the Great
Northern and successor to his dis
tinguished father in the management
of the great Hill estate. The James
Memorial Library is a gift to Willis
ton from the heirs of T. Willis James,
a personal friend and associate of the
late James J. Hill, and after whom
the city was named.
The second gift will be a great flag
staff which will be erected near the
Great Northern station. This will
be the gift of Mrs. James J. Hill, the
widow of the railroad builder. It will
be presented to the commercial club
which will provide a caretaker who
will be responsible for having 'Old
Glory" flying in the breeze on every
public occasion.
The announcement of the trifts was
made to Secretary F. S. Morrill of
the commercial club, by Louis Hill
while in the city Sunday evening.
OLSON-STEVENS
Annie Caroline Olson and Russell
Stevens were united in marriage at
the Methodist church Tuesday, June
27, Rev. H. Styles Harriss officiating.
About 20 relatives and friends of the
young couple were in attendance. The
bride is from Alexander and the
groom from Marmon.
North Dakota Men
May Be Sent To
California Border
Fort Lincoln, N. D., June 28.—
Anxiously awaiting orders that will
send them to the south, and which are
now regarded as assured within the
next few hours, the First infantry,
North Dakota regiment, continued its
hard work in camp today, despite un
favorable weather conditions.
It is now generally reported that
the North Dakota guard, when sent
south, will be given positions on the
border along the southern line of Cal
ifornia, instead of being sent into
Texas.
North Dakota's regiment men are
under the command of General Barry,
of Chicago, who today ordered sev
eral units of the central army to the
south.
Williston Couple
Weds At Waterloo
Word has been received that Joe
Donahue and Miss Bridgie Shea two
of Williston's popular young people
were married Tuesday at Waterloo,
Iowa, which is the home of the groom.
The Graphic joins their many friends
in congratulations and best wishes.
BEST ill REGIMENT
WILLISTON IS CREDITED WITH
SENDING BEST DRILLED
COMPANY
Bismarck, N. D., June 28.—There
is every indication today that the
North Dakota regiment which now is
training at Fort Lincoln, will start
for a southern concentration camp
within 48 hours.
Adjutant General Thomas Tharal
son received orders today to notify
the railroads of the route to be taken,
but he has not received the route. It
was mailed from the department head
quarters at Chicago and should reach
Bismarck this afternoon.
All recruiting details have been
called in, and the adjutant general has
notified the department headquarters
that the North Dakota companies are
ready to move.
Fort Lincoln, Bismarck, June 27.—
Further indications of an early move
of North Dakota troops from Fort
Lincoln came today with an order for
all recruiting officers to report here
immediately.
Each company had detailed at the
home station a lieutenant, a non-com
missioned officer and a private to en
list men for the purpose of bringing
the regiment up to war strength, and
these men are expected in camp to
moiTow.
This means that recruiting will
cease and the previous orders to equip
the men on hand so that the troops
can leave immediately will be carried
into effect.
A good portion of the men recruited
late have been fitted out and more
equipment is being received hourly.
As to where the troops will go is still
a matter of conjecture, but from un
official sources comes information that
it will be St. Louis, Mo. The general
opinion is that the North Dakota regi
ment will be sent first to a big con
centration camp, where troops can
be trained in masses and also for the
purpose of shooting on the large
ranges at St. Louis.
The forenoon was spent in drill,
battalion movements being execut
ed for the first time. Williston is cred
ited with sending the best drilled com
pany into camp, with Company M., of
Grand Forks, a close competitor. Wil
liston, like Grand Forks, has an or
ganization of home boys. Company
C. of Grafton has one made up of
men who have served in the militia
of that place before and they expect
ed to swing into shape in a short time.
CARW PROTESTS
ALLEGED OUTRAGES
NO REPLY TO AMERICAN DE
MANDS—CRUCIAL TIME CON
SIDERED TO BE AT HAND
Washington, June 28.—A note, pro
testing against outrages against Mex
ican citizens, alleged to have been
committed by the American forces
30,000 strong, in marching from San
Geronima toward Valle, was sent to
the state department today by Mexi
can Ambassador Designate Arredondo,
on instructions from the Carranza
foreign office. It contained a vigorous
complaint against the alleged arrest
and mistreatment of 300 civilians at
La Cruz. It requested that the guilty
officers be punished and that steps be
taken to prevent a recurrence.
An overnight dispatch from Special
Agent Rodgers at Mexico City brought
the information that a special car left
yesterday for Vera Cruz carrying 70
Americans, iincluding 21 from Guasa
juato. The message was the first word
the department has received from
Rodgers since he reported the deliv
ery of the note, and said the Mexican
authorities were investigating the
Carrizal affair, but gave no indica
tion of a probable reply to the Amer
ican demands.
The note charges the Apache scouts
with the Americans with brutal treat
ment of people in their path.
The column referred to is presum
ed to be part of Pershing's main force
moving northward from the advanced
base at Namiquipa, according to the
note, with orders to draw in the lines
in preparation for a possible general
assault.
So far as learned, the war depart
ment has not been advised of the ar
rest of any civilians.
Crucial Day In Crisis
Washington, June 28.—This is re
garded by Washington officials as the
cruical day in the negotiations with
Mexico.
It is probably the last day allowed
Carranza in which to comply with the
United States' demand for the re
lease of 23 troopers held as prison
ers at Chihuahua City.
If a reply, either by act, or in a
communication does not arrive by to
night, or if it is necessary, President
Wilson is determined to go before
congress, probably tomorrow, and ask
authority to rescue the prisoners by
force.
Unofficial reports today said Car
ranza's reply was enroute to Wash
ington. Officials had no intimation of
its nature.
All questions including possible
mediation, are regarded as subsi
diary to that of freeing the troopers
held as prisoners.
New Cause For Apprehension
El Paso, June 28.—Fresh cause for
apprehensio nwas found along the
border today in the news of the gath
ering of strong forces of former Villa
soldiers under notorious chieftains in
the vicinity of Juarez and close sur
veillance by civil and military au
thorities of former Villa adherents
who are now refugees in El Paso.
General Jose Alorez, commanding
800 infantrymen is reported to be in
Juarez after making peace with the
de facto government. General Man
uel Banda, once a Villa subordinate
is known to be across the Rio Grande
and Manuel Medinavietta and Jose
Ysabel Roblez have taken advantage
of annesty granted by Carranza. I
Maximo Castillo, another former Villa
leader, is in Juarez.
Carranza Cavalry Concentrated
Columbus, N. M., June 28.—Large
forces of Cari-anza cavalry are being
concentrated a short distance east of
Pershing's line communication be
tween Colonia Dublan and Elvalle, ac
cording to reports brought here today
by army motor truck men. It is as
serted the American expeditionary
commander is drilling his men regu
larly and sparing no effort to make
the force as mobile as possible.
U. S. Sentry and Mexicans Exchange
Shots
Nogales, Ariz., June 28.— -Shots
were exchanged early today between
a sentry squad on the west side of
the town and a detachment of Mexi
can soldiers.
The corporal in charge of the post
reported that he challenged the Mex
icans, but that they continued to ad
vance without replying, after they
were well over the line they fired at
him. The cororal then ordered his
sciuad to fire. The Mexicans retreat
ed. No American casualties resulted.
Club Secretary
In New Office
Secretary F. S. Morill of the Com
mercial Club is now located in an of
fice in the city building. He .states
that he will be glad to have anyone
interested in any way call on him in
his new quarters. Country people,
town people, home people or strangers
are all equally welcome and anv ser
vice that can be rendered •vill be
cheerfully attended to.
STORE BROKEN INTO
Early Monday morning the Hagen
hardware was entered and $16. in
money taken from the till. Night
policeman Jarstad arrested Harry
Hammel in the rear of the building
and he was given a hearing and bound
over. Hammel just finished serving
a six months sentence at Bismarck
for bootlegging.
Wi!iiston Graphic
WILLISTON, WILLIAMS COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY, JUNE 29, 1916. $1.50 PER YEAR IN ADVANCE
CITIZENS FAREWELL
TO THEIR SOLDIERS
GODSPEED TO COMPANY E EX
PRESSED IN NUMEROUS ACTS
—DEPART SUNDAY A. M.
Company E with over 80 members
in charge of Captain H. R. Evans, 1st
Lieut. E. W. Jeffrey and 2nd Lieut. W.
W. Jeffrey departed by special train
for Fort Lincoln (Bismarck) at five
a. m. Sunday morning. Relatives and
friends in large numbers were at the
station to say farewell, good luck and
a safe return to the boys in brown
who have answered their country's
call. The city takes just pride in her
soldier boys who have answered so
promptly the call of duty. The boys
will be sadly missed—are already
missed, from offices and stores and
shops and farms.
Dinner and Dance
Friday evening was one long to be
remembered by the Company and
many citizens who sought to express
the measure of pride and affection
the city feels for her soldier boys. A
sumptuous dinner was prepared and
served at Odd Fellows' hall by the
ladies of the city. Two large tables
were spread bountifully laden and
beautifully decorated with, cut flow
ers. Flags of various sizes were
draped on the walls, and small flag
pins served to fasten buttoniers of
pansies. Over sixty of the Company
were seated at the tables.
The women of Williston, including
all organizations, churches and many
individuals as well as business firms
contributed to the occasion. The
Commercial club sent several boxes
of cigars. Besides the dinner the of
ferings of the ladies included $28.55
in cash which was turned over to the
Company officers for the commisary
fund.
After dinner J. W. Jackson, W. G.
Owens and Rev. Elsworth made ap
propriate addresses. The people ab
sent with the Burdick Special felt
keen regret at missing the memorable
affairs.
Company Play
The same evening the company pre
sented the home talent play 'At
Tampa Bay" at the Armory to a large
and appreciative audience. After the
play a most enjoyable dance was held
and was joined in by soldiers and
citizens.
The militia boys appreciated the
occasion to the fullest and were em
phatic in their appreciation of the ap
preciation and consideration sh6wn
them.
FLAG PRESENTED
The Williston Elks presented Com
pany "E" with a beautiful flag to
serve as the Company's colors. The
presentation was made Saturday even
ing when a large number of the B. P.
O. E. marched in a body to the Arm
ory. The presentation was made by
Wm. G. Owens in a fitting address.
The acceptance was made by Lieut.
E. W. Jeffrey who expressed the pleas
ure and gratitude of the Company.
Unfortunately the flag itself did not
arrive until after the Company left
for Fort Lincoln. Tuesday it was on
exhibition in Hedderich & Co. win
dow. It is 5 10 feet in size, made
of the best flag bunting, is trimmed
with fringe cord and tassel of gold
color, and is attached to a wooden
staff. The Flag will be forwarded to
the Company.

Game With Bainville
Friday Evening, 6:30
Bainville is coming for a game with
the Opportunes tomorrow evening.
Williston won the game played at
Bainville Monday, 8 to 2, but the Mon
tana team, it is learned, will
strengthen with ployers from Glas
gow and other towns and come with
the fixed purpose of trimming Willis
ton.
Spalding, who pitched last Sunday's
game for Glasgow against Williston,
and who is ranked as one of the very
best semi-pro twirlers in the North
west, will again try to break our win-:
ning streak. It will be a game worth
seeing.
Roosevelt Comes Out
Squarely For Hughes
Chicago, 111., June 26.—Theodore
Roosevelt, in a letter read to the Pro
gressive national committee in session
here today finally declined to accept
the presidential nomination of tne
party and strongly urged the Bull
Moose organization to support
Hughes.
Roosevelt's letter was read by Os
car King Davis, secretary of the com
mittee. It was in part, as follows:
To the Progressive National Com
mittee:
Gentlemen—In accordance with the
message I sent to the Progressive na
tional convention as soon as I had
received the notification that it had
nominated me for president, 1 now
communicate to you mv reasons for
declining the honor which I so deeply
appreciate. Since the adjournment of
the convention 1 have received be
tween two and three thousand letters
and telegrams from men who had
supported me for the nomination, the
majority expressing the desire that I
would refuse to run, while a minority
urged that I should accept the nom
ination. As it is physically impos
sible to answer these letters and tele
grams individually, I beg of the cour
tesy of the senders that they will ac
cept this public statement in lieu of
such answers.
Mr. Hughes has shown in his career
the instinct of efficiency which will
guarantee that, under him, the gov
ernment will once more work with
vigor and force. He possesses that
habit of straightforward thinking
which means that his words will be
correlated with his deeds and trans
lated into fact. His past career is the
warrant for our belief that .he will be
the unfaltering opponent of that sys
tem of invisible government which
finds expression in the domination of
the party boss and the party ma
chine. His past career is a guarantee
that whatever he says before election
will be made good by his acts after
election. Morally, his public record
shows him to be a man of unbending
integrity intellectually, it shows him
to be a man of original and trained
ability. We have the alternative of
continuing in office an administration
which has proved a lamentable fail
ure, or of putting into office an ad
ministration which we have every
reason to believe will function with
efficiency for the interest and honor
of all our people. I earnestly bespeak
from my fellow Progressives their
ungrudging support of Mr. Hughes.
Yours truly,
Theodore Roosevelt.

ANXIOUS TO FORI SEC
OND 1.0. REGIMENT
GOVERNOR HANNA RECEIVES
MANY REQUESTS FROM CITIES
AND INDIVIDUALS
If President Wilson calls for volun
teers, as is strongly indicated in mes
sages which Governor L. B. Hanna
has received in the past day or two,
there will be no trouble raising an
other regiment in North Dakota.
When interviewed over long dis
tance telephone this morning, Gover
nor Hanna stated that yesterday he
received a message from a New York
paper, declaring that there were
strong indications in the c.ist that the
president would call for 250,000 vol
unteers within the next week and
asking him if it would be possible to
raise another North Dakota regiment.
"There will be no trouble," said the
governor. "Since the North Dakota
national guard began mobilizing, I
have received innumerable letters
from every section of the state, offer
ing assistance in organizing new com
panies. These letters have come from
individuals, from cities and from com
mercial clubs. Mott, Beach, Cando
and other cities have asked for per
mission to organize new companies.
Many individuals, among them sev
eral from Grand Forks, have asked
the same privilege.
"North Dakota people have re
sponded patriotically and magnificent
ly. Everywhere they are interested
and it would be but a few days' work
to organize another regiment.''
Governor Hanna also stated that
the first regiment was steadily being
recruited up to war strength.
The executive would give no defi
nite information as to when the na
tional guard would be called south or
to which camp they would go.
LIBRARY CLOSED ON 4TH
The library will be closed all day
on July 4th, is the announcement of
Librarian Bessie R. Baldwin.
CAR TURNS OVER
Ryder, N. D.. June 28.—Louis Pet
erson and Frank Kersey were severe
ly injured in an auto accident on the
reservation when the car which they
were riding in turned over twice. The
former was thrown clear of the car,
but received a broken collar bone
from the fall. The latter was severely
bruised.
The accident was caused by a
loosened and defective steering gear
and, owing to the fact that they tried
to get the car out of a rut in the
road.

EMBARGO ON EXPORTATION OP
SUPPLIES TO MEXICO MADE
EFFECTIVE
Both Armies Drawn Up In Semblence
of Battle Lines—Mexicans
Reinforced
San Antonio, Texas, June 27.—Gen
eral i-'unston and his statF searched
every report from all border stations
today for some sign of hostility on
the part of Carranza's army that is
pouring into Northern Mexico, but the
real work at department headquarters
was the supervision of the multi
tudinous delails incident to preparing
the American force for efficient action.
Over night and early morning re
ports from El Paso, Eagle i'asa,
Brownsville and other headquarters
posts indicated that no active aggres
sion by Mexicans and only a brief
reference was given to bandit activi
ties anywhere.
Information brought to border com
manders from the interior of Mexico
continued to show a steady strength
ening of the Mexican army in th«
North and tended to support reports
that the bandit leaders are being wel
comed gladly by Mexican officers and
are being given commissions in the
de facto government's army.
The units of the American army
have been stationed in such a manner
that almost instant action could be
secured by the commanding officer
here. No relaxation of efforts to
guard border towns and ranches from
bandits has been displayed, but far
more attention has been paid to mar
tialing thousands of men along the
border from Brownsville to the ex
treme west in what, is in effect, a line
of battle.
Carranza Must Reply At Once
Washington, June 27—Mediation of
the dispute with Mexico was a dead
issue today.
Twelve thousand national guards
men are ready to start for the border
to enforce the United State's demands
on the Carranza government.
Secretary Lansing has prevented
even a formal proposal of mediation
by telling Minister Caldweron of Bo
livia, that the American government
believes nothing in the situation is
subject to arbitration.
Carranza previously had accepted
"in principle," the offer to mediate.
Further elimination of "red tape"
by army officers hastened the work of
getting the troops to the border.
There were clear indications today
that if the American cavalry men
captured at Carrizal are not released
wtihin 48 hours, action will be taken
by the United States. The impres
sion prevailed in official circles that
Wilson will not wait beyond Thursday
at the latest, and possibly not beyond
tomorrow afternoon for a definite re
ply from the Carranza government to
the note demanding the immediate re
lease of the prisoners and a declara
tion of intentions.
It is certain that no aggressive mil
itary operations will be undertaken
until a substantial number of state
troops are available to back up Fun
ston's first step should he decide to
force the issue, probably will be to
lay the whole situation before con
gress in joint session.
The discussion of the crisis occupied
today's brief cabinet meeting.
Embargo Is In Effect
San Antonio, Tex., June 27.—An
embargo on the exportation of sup
plies into Mexico from the United
States has already affected the Mexi
can annv, according to reports receiv
ed here. It became known that the
reason the Mexican force recently left
Neuvo Laredo was because it was
unable to obtain forage for its horses
from this side of the border.
The situation opposite Naco, Ariz.,
where 1,500 Mexican troops are being
held on trains aroused wide spread
speculation here.
General Funston announced that
American officers are sure they have
fathomed the design of this Mexican
troop movement and reinforcements
have been sent to the American force
at Naco and entrenchments have been
thrown up there.
The activity at Naco was explained
today. Information reached head
quarters that the Mexicans planned
to sweep across the line to Bisbes and
there raid the offices and storehouses
of copper and smelting concerns. The
Twenty-second infantry was rushed
from Douglas to Bisbee last night.
Company E Expects To
Go To California
A dispatch from Captain Evans
states that the North Dakota regi
ment will probably leave Fort Lin
coln early next week for southern
California by way of Portland. He
says 20 recruits for E Company are
wanted.
Another message from Sargent
Thiessen says that a call for volun
teers fbr the aviation corps .: re
sponded to by 21 members of the
company. He also states that the dif
ferent companies are provided with
commisary funds ranging from $600.
to $1,200. The purpose of such a
fund is to make it possible for the
boys to secure such comforts and
necessities as are not provided for in
the government rations—fruit, veg
etables, tobacco and reading matter,
etc. The fund for the Williston com
pany has not yet been completed but
is being raised this week. There is
nothing too good for the boys who
have gone to the front.
