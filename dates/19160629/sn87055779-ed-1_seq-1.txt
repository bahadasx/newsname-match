hands of his pru.'rutors today.
Many times he stumbled in tin
nurse of the questioning he was jiit
to hy A?st. State's Attv. Joslyn. and
n iio occasion, when Iiis confusion
was pitiful, his ounsel stepped to
the hench and begged of Judge Don
1 1 -1 1 - a recess, which was promptly
i fused. The examination was con
ducted in a crazy-quilt manner. First
Joslyn would leal him into the
woods- where the hody of Marian
Lami'Tt was found, then he would
hao him on the train, or hack in
Iiis room In Madison. Orpet had
difficulty in finding the rapier-like
thrusts of his questioner. .
While they were sjioakinj; of the
death scene in the woods. Joslyn
suddenly asked:
'"lid you throw something out of
the window Into Iike Winona as

the train"'
"Sc." shouted Oipet.

"Why?" Wan th"ie more tlian

in Iii.-- chair aatn.
Joslyn then abandoned the line

violent bark t the d-ith scene,
where op. t had kr.c't at the side
of the ihiiic Rirl rpet said he was
certain that Marian was dead when
he left her.
"When npr you unite re tli.it

"When 1 lü her .n the woods."
"How did you know that she was

"asemenv was toda found guilty of
hlli treaxm in the lii'h court of
J UStice.
The jury was out ouh fifty min-
tites.
Iniriiediately after the erdi--t was
teturned ';tsernent was .sentenced to
death hy i'.aion Ittitdiim. tiie lortl
hief justice.
As the erdict was announced
Casement stood up hraey under th.e
blow. He had eidently entertained
little hope from the oetcinnin of tlie
trial.
.s'ir KoL'er. who was arrested in
April while trying to hind ar.ns and
ammunition in Ireland for the reb
els, was placed on trial last Monday.
There were two lines ot defense;
first, that the offense, if an. was
committed outside the realms of
Fnland; second, that Casement did
not plot to aid the enemies of Film
land, but to help tiie Irish people to
freedom.
The atiorney general. Sir Frede
rick F. Smith, in summing up for
the prosecution said that tiie argu
ment set up by Casement's, counsel
was that there was a home rule hill
on the statute books for the north
of Ireland, that forces were arming
for resistance and t.'iar as the mil
itary was inadequate for the sup-
pott of those wishing th bill to ce
eome a law it was necessary for all
Irishmen to arm.
"Had th acts for which the pris
oner was arraigned been commit
ted before the war and at the time
of the formation of the Ulster vol
unteers these words miKht have had
relevancy," said thf attorney gen

for a full report on the Carrizal hat
tie. Gen. Jacinto B. TTevino has
transmitted from Chihuahua City
a statement which he says was
sworn to by Lemuel 11. Spilsbury. the
civilian interpreter who accompanied
the American forces to Carrizal. In
this statement, which was made
public today, Spilsbury holds the
American soldiers responsible for
the conflict; that On. Gomez, the
Mexican commander, was courteous
in his warnings to th 10th cavalry
and that Capt. Charles Eoyd thought
the Mexicans were bl tiffin?.
Following is the full text of Spil-
bury's statement as ent by Gen. Tre
ino: "My name is Iemuel pilsbury and

"Capt. Royd sent nto Carrizal a
messenger yesterday morning to the
jefe politico saying he was on a
peaceful mission and asking permis
sion to pass through Villa Ahumada
and for him to advise the military
authorities.
"Gen. Gomez sent out Lieut. Col.
Rivas with an escort of eighty men
to tell tis that he had orders to t-top
us there until he heard further.
"Capt. Boyd said he had heard of
a Tohhery in Santo Do min pro and the
presence of bandits there and he
wanted to run them down. He want
ed also to recapture a deserter who
got away.
Dvfie Americans.
' Lieut. Col. Rivas replied that
there were no bandits in that place
and that they would have to pass
over their dead bodies.
"After further talk he retired
back to the town and Gen. Gomez
sent a note a.king the Americans to
come in the town for a conference.
"('apt. Boyd did not like the Idea
and said so. whereupon Gen. Gomez
called personally and repeited hi
orders that they could not pa&a
through. He Faid that his lnFtnic-
itlons from Gen. Trevlno were that
if Americans moved to the faßt,
west or south of their old positions
they were to be attacked; Gen. Per
shing must know this and that the
captain ought also to know it.
"Capt. Boyd admitted that he was
aware of the orders, but his own
orders were to get through to Villa
Ahumada and he had to otroy.
"Gen. Gomez repeated h'.s re
fusal arid said that if the A Tierica.na
advanced he would at once fire on
them. Capt. Boyd atd all right,
but I think he thought G n. Go.nez
was only trying to comply with his
orders from his superior and would
not really attack.
"Gen Gomez hail retired to hii
