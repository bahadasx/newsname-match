Prisoners of War Stripped of Clothing, Arms and Accouterments Arrive

WASHINGTON', Jump 21). ("nrranza's release of the prisoner
he UeUl in I'hiliualma and their Hubsequent delivery to Ameriean
army officers at Juarez has somewhat relieved the teiiaion and the
danger of an immediate break with Mexico is apparently not
imminent.
Until CarraitZH replies to the demand relative to his attitude
toward the American expedition into Mexico and to protect the
border from bandits the crisis is only less imminent than before.
Should the reply be unfavorable a new situation would have to
be met.
An official intimated that the United States would continue its
military operations to safeguard eitiiens and its territory and
continue to pursue bandits when there is hope of capture.
Even should Carranza disclaim any hostile intention the border
patrol will be maintained ut the strength contemplated while there
is any danger from bandits. It is also insisted that Mexico must
establish military control of its northern states to make raiding
into the United States impossible.

EL PASO, June 21). Twenty-three negro troopers captured by
Mexicans at C'arrizal and confined in the penitentiary at CbUiuahua
City, accompanied by Lem. II. Spillsbury, the Mormon civilian
scout, were brought to the border at noon today and turned over to
American army officers.
A shout of laughter rose from thousands of Mexicans at Juarez
when they saw the prisoners clad in the scantiest nondescript garb
One man wore a shirt witn a towel encircling Ins waist and some
wore only trousers.
Spillabury was dressed in white duck and appeared anxious.
The troopers looked worn and drawn from their experiences in
prison.

By Aaaoclated Preaa.)
PETROGRAD. June 29 Russian
troops fighting in Volhynia and Gall
cla captured 221 officers and 10.000
men, says an official report to tha
War office.
The statement says the Russians
Indicted a great defeat on the Teu
tonic troops between the Dnefster
and Pruth rivers, capturing three
lines of trenches.
White Caps was In demand this morning soon after the opening w
of the call In San Francisco and before the close at noon over 18,000
shares changed hands at rapidly advancing figures. The biock was w
quoted yesterday at 18 bid and 19 asked, but this morning the In-
quiry sent the price up with every flash from San Francisco. Tbe
last sale of the morning was at 25 and closed 23 Did. . w
The sudden activity was due to a message from Superintendent
J. A. Cole at Manhattan stating that the ledge had been cut on the
310 level. P. S. Booth, the secretary, was first apprised of the
strike and he communicated the n ews to the numerous atockholdera,
who have been waiting expectantly for the announcement, which
establishes the continuance of the rich orebody to 100 feet- deeper
than had existed. In the minds of the management there had not
been the slightest doubt of prov Ing the continuity of the vein, but
until this was established and actually demonstrated by the pre-
ence of ore, there always remaine d a long chance that a fault might
have interfered with the regular formation. The ledge was cut in
the east drift.
Since the company has demonstrated the feasibility of treating
the ore by a process that extracts 90 per cent of the assay values,
there Is np longer any hesitation about predicting that the manage-
ment will Immediately proceed w ith the Installation of a reduction
plant at the mine. The development of today proves up a wonder-
a ful tonnage and It la expected that within the next five or six days
the formation will be encountered In the west drift.

BE11NR, Switzerland, June 29.
People living along the Swiss border
of the lake of Constance have been
greatly surprised over tbe move
ments of the new monster airsiup,
much larger than all other Zeppelins,
that has been making trial trips over
the lake. The length of this ship is
said to be 240 yards, or almost
double that of other Zeppelins. The
cubic contents Is even more than
double, 64,000 cubic meters Instead
of 20,000, and the number of the
gondolas Is four instead of two.
These gondolas are said to be armed
with nuns, machine guns, and a new
kind of air torpedo.
Despite Its huge bulk the ship gives j
the Impression of nsn-iiae sienaer
nesB. The steering gear forms an
exact croBS. The motors are 3,000
4,000 horsepower, able to give the
airship a speed of 90 kilometers an
hour. To avoid breakdowns the mo
tors are In double number. The
crew is said to be 30 to 40 men. The
ship can reach a height of three to
four miles.
Attorney Sam Piatt returned last
night from New York, where he com
pleted negotiations for the final settle

EL PASO. June 29. Release of the
twenty-three American prisoners held
at Chihuahua, as demanded by the
president, has been agreed to by
Mexican authorities and the prisoners
left for this point last night under
heavy guard, expecting to reach here
by 10 o'clock. The men left Carrlzal
surrounded by a double guard.
Reports from Washington state that
a crisis has been averted temporarily,
but there Is no indication that the
situation has been bridged, since the
main Issue, after the surrender of the
prisoners, remains the threat of Gen
eral Trevlno that Gen. Pershing's
troops must not move east, west or
south without Inviting a slate of war.
This is the meat In the cocoanut that
the diplomatic representatives must
m.isticate before the trouble Is di
gested. No one here in authority thinks
there Is the slightest chance of avoid
ing hostilities, as the breach was
allowed to widen to such an extent
that it seems almost Impossible to
hew a way through the many com
plications arising from me bad state
of mind engendered by events of the
past week. In the first place Car
ranza must declare himself In unmis
takable terms regarding overtures he
is alleged to have made to Villa to
unite his forces with the de facto
troops for the purpose of waging war
against the United States. There In
no doubt but that concerted action
was proposed If not definitely ar-'
ranged between the rival factions of
the Mexican government. Carranza
will be kept busy disavowing the
acts of his subordinates, especially
the notice from the governor of Yuca
tan that a state of war actually ex
isted between that state and the
United States. This notice was for
mally served on the commander of"
the Annapolis with a warning to re
move all American citizens from that,
state, so there cannot be any repudia
tion of the official warning. It la
not believed that any permanent
peace overtures can be entertained
so long as Gen. Trevlno la maintained
in command of the northern border.
