field, while Geo. Smith is a poor fourth
John Burke had no trouble winning
the democratic nomination for United
States senator, Winning over F. O.
Hellstrom by a wide margin.
The demcoratic nomination for gov
ernor seems to belong to D. H. Mc
Arthur, although returns on that fight
are still somewhat indefinite.
Down the line with hte Republican
state ticket candidates, a split ticket
as between the Non-partisan league
candidates and the anti-league candi
dates.
For lieutenant governor, A. T. Kraa
bel has run well ahead of O. J. Sorlie
and no doubt has been nominated.
The fight for attorney general is re
markably interesting, with H. J. Linde
showing greater strength than other
anti-league men and the probabilities
are that Linde has been nominated,
though it will require much more com
plete returns than are now available,
to determine the outcome.
Carl Joigenson and Karl Kositsky,
rival candidates for state auditor, are
having a see-saw time of it all along
the way and the outcome there is in
definite.
No figures have become available on
the Insurance Commissioner, commis
sioners of railroads.
On the Supreme Court, the figures
that have been received indicate that
the three candidates endorsed by the
Nonpartisan league will be the highest
candidates.
vsIn the First congressional district
F. T.,Cuthbert of Devils Lake has
made a great race against Congress
man Helgesen, but returns available
do not indicate the result, though Hel
gesen leads by a harrow margin.
It will be two or three days before
the complete returns of the election
will be available, this fact growing
out of the demoralized condition of the
state wire service, caused by yester
day's storms, general all over the
state.
The storm has delayed the rural
vote reports to the county auditors,
while in many instances it was im
possible last evening to reach the
county seats by telephone or telegraph

Burdick, McCumber and Cuthbert

McCumber has carried the county /n
good shape.
The vote was considered rather Mrfht
in this county, owing to the heavy
rain yesterday, but in the rural dis

strong but failed to nominate their

Complete returns of the county '-ill
probably be in by tonight or in the

Dr. Hyslin, formerly of Oregon has
decided to locate in Edmore for the

IIMEDIATE BREAK WITH UNITED
STATES AVERTED—HIS ATI I
TUDE TOWARD TROOPS MAY
DECIDE ISSUE.
IF DE FACTO GOVERNMENT
STANDS BY TREV1NO ORDER
SITUATION REMAINS SAME
Washington, June 28.—An immed
iate break between the United States
and the de facto government of Mex
ico has been averted by coi ii liance
with the American demand for tho „e
lease of the twenty-three tr ...pers
captured in the fight at Carvvzal.
Whether a state of war has been
prevented or merely postpone^ no one
here would attempt to say tonight.
Official information as to the atti
tude of General Carranza wais lacking.
Until his response to Secreta'
7
Lan­
sing's note, dispatched Sunday, ma!
ing two pre-emptory.and distinct de
mands, is received, there will be no
decision as to whether President Wil
son shall lay the crisis before Con
gress.
News of the release of the prisongVb

patches, brought undisguised
of a
Moreover, it was assumed
ranza, impressed with the
the situation, has ordered
ed cavalrymen started f^ tire border
without waiting for his announcement
of the action to reach Washington.
While it is generally conceded -that
this move lessened the tension ana
makes the crisis less imminent, no one
conversant with the grave problems is
Josing sight of the fact that the all
important question of Carranza's at
titude toward the American expedi". ,n
across the border to protect the ter
ritory and citizens of the L\v.tns.
Stated States from bandit outlav raid
ers remains unsettled.
If the de facto government acts up
on the order of General Trevino to at
tack General Pershing's men when
they move otherwise than toward the
border, the situation actually is just
what it was before, except that now
there is a possibility of diplomatic ne
gotiations that did not exist while the
Americans Were held prisoners at Chi
huahua.
The preparations of the United
States for war will go steadily on.
There will be no interruption of the
rush of National Guardsmen to the
border, and General Funston will con
tinue disposing of the forces under his
command as though he expected an im
mediate attack from the Mexicans.
The fact that Carranza has com
plied with one of the'demands is ex
pected by the more opftnistic officials
here as an indication that he is striv
ing to prevent a break. Even though
he again should attempt to throw the
blame for the Carrizal clash upon the
American officers and insist upon his
rights to forcibly oppose any except
a northward movement of the Ameri
can troops, it is thought that possibly
he will state his position in such a
way as to make further concessions
necessary.
During any negotiations,! however,
the United States will insist upon the
the freedom of movement of troops in
Mexico, and any attempt to interfere
with them will be met with such force
as is necessary.
It is known that powerf\il influences
have been brought to bear on Carran
za in the past few days to make him
at least turn over the American pris
oners.
They all sent him the same warning
—that the United States government
meant business, and that to hold the
prisoners would mean war.
Secretary Baker waited at the war
department until late tqnight for a re
port from General f^inston on Genev
al Trevino's announcement that he
had sent the cavalrymen to Jarez to
be set free. He finally went home
without the report.
Prisoners to Be Sent North Today
San Antonia, June 28.~General Funs
ton reecive^ a report from Brigidier
General Bell which stated that Gener
al Bell had been notified by the Mexi
can Consul Garcia that the American
prisoners, taken at Cairizal, now are
-A.
w.?**
on their way north to Jarez and prob
ably would arrive there in the morn-,
ing.
According to a report, Consul Garqi!
had received word from General Tre
vino that the American prisoners,
with tehir arms and counfepement®
-were to be delivered at oncfe to the
American authorities. The Report was
forwarded at once to Washington by
General Funston.
"This shows that we,don't want war
unless it is forced upon us," said MiC'
Garcia.
It is expected that the arriving
prisoners will form a happy party.
Accounts received at the border have
been to the effect that the dusky
troopers w^jfie a gloomy lot on their
way to Chihauhau City. Only today
Only today a dispatch from that city
quoted one of the prisoners as saying:
"If we'ever get back to God's, coun
try, we don't want leave there any
more.."
Consul Garcia was trying tonight to
get fuller details of the release, and
the exact hour that the troopers will
arrive here,
At the methodist parsonage in this
city on June 20th, occurred the mar
riage of Mr. Gustav DeBoer and Miss
Minnie Wittkoff, both prominent
young people of Webster. The cere
mony was performed by Rev. C. E.
Stinson. The bride was attended by
Mrs. Frank Walford, sister of the
bride and Weiger. DeBoer acted as
best man.
Both the contracting parties are well
and favorably known in the vicinity
in which they live and have a large
circle of friends who will join in wish
ing them happiness and prosperity.
They will make their home* on the
farm of the groom near Webster.
NEWS WRITERS MUST PAY
THEIR OWN WAY TO BORDER
Washington, June 28.—To clear up
misunderstandings, the War Depart
ment issued orders to the departmen
tal commanders, directing that news
paper Representatives be permitted to
accompany national guard or other
troop trains to the border, travc.
their own expense.
Requests have poured in from pa
pers in all parts of the country ask
ing if it was necessary that War De
partment credentials be obtained be
fore representatives could be sent with
the state regiments as they are order
ed South. Secretary Baker ruled that
the department had no objection
any arrangement the various com
manders might make in this regard,
provided the government was at no ex
pense.
Regulations .regarding newspaper
men who accompany troops in Mexico
remain unchanged. Full credentials
must be issued by the War Depart
ment in such case and no additional
correspondents will be allotted to Gen.
Pershing's command at present.
Correspondents accompanying state
troops to the border must provide
their own equipment and supplies. The
order is construed here to mean, how
ever, that they could be included in an
army officers' mess by paying their
share of the cost.
