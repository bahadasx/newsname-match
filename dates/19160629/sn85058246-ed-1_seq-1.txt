Maria Rosa, the photopjay that
made Goraldlno Farrar a brldo, will
beTlho, attraction at the L.KT,lc Thea
ter on Friday and Saturday. This
1a the third production made by Miss
Farrar for the Jesso L. Lasky Fea
ture Play Company tho others bolnR
Carmen, and Temptation,
It has been called the photoplay
tlint made Geraldlne Farrar a brldo,
because It was whllo Miss Farrar
was at the Lasky studios In Califor
nia last summer making this produc
tion that slio first met Mr. Lou Tel
legen, the striking young actor,
whom she married In Now York sev
eral months ago. The romance had
Its start under the clear blue, skies
of Southern California while the
two artists were In each others com
peny dally". Lou Tcllegen was (it
tho Lasky studious at the same time,
appearing In picture version of Tho
Unknown, and The Explorer.
In Maria Rosa, a Paramount pic
ture, Miss Farrar wll have a part
quite different from the role of Car
men or Reno Dupree In Temptation.
In this Spanltji tragedy, taken from
the play by Guldo Marburg and Wat
luco Glllpatrlck and founded on the
story by Anget Gulmera, Miss Farrar
appears as a young Spanish peasant
girl, for whoso hand two admlrei.!
aro in eager contest. One of tho
youths, Ramon, Is of a Jealous na
ture and not liked by Maria Rosa
The other, Andres, is her favorite
These roles will bo played respect
ively by Pedro do Cordoba and Wal
lace Reld.
Ramon manages to remove tho fa
vored Andres by having htm falsely
accused of crime for which lie is
sentenced to a long prison term
Jr; Relieving Andres dead, Maria Rosa,
m after much persuasion, finally con-
I sents to marry Ramon. On tho woJ-
ding day Andres returns and tho
wholo plot Is revealed to tho heurt
H broken Maria Rosa. Tho finish of
I the play Is with Ramon's death and
I tho happy uniting of the two real
H lovers.
Produced and directed by Cecil U
H DeMlllo, Maria Rosa, In tho opinion
H of thoHo who already have, seen It,
H Is dbcldcdly thb best of tho three
H productions which Miss Farrar thus
H far has made for tho Lasky Com
H pany. Ernest Joy, Anita King, Hor

THIS "WATCHFUL
WAITING" HAS
SEEN ITS OAY
f '
That the time for ringing down
the curtain on tho "Watchful Wait
ing" net Is overduo there now op
pears no doubt. And that tho admin
Utratlon should at once, send for tho
message that knows no rotreat until
American blood has been avenged, if
we mistake not, Is tho universal
opinion of tho peoplo of the United
States. At tho recent Bankers' Con
tention at Ogden, Hon. A. W. Iv
ins enlightened his hearers on tho
Moxlcan situation, and his logic uas
so sound and clear that ho was cheur
rd to tho echo. Ho said In part:
"If I were tho adviser of tho Presi
dent of tho United States, I would
recommend tho lmmedlnto occupancy
of tho Mexican states of Chihuahua,
Coahulla, Sonora, and Slnaloa; this
would establish an effectual bloc
ado and the war would go no furth
er." "Tho cause of Mexico's present
troublo began more than 300 yoars
ago, and Is tho direct result of op
pression of about 14,000,000 porsons
by the million persons of Spanish
blood who hold most of tho land and
hold tho others in peonage. Until
something Is done to break up the
largo cstatbs so tho Mexicans may
get land of their own, until the ss
tern of oppression Is destroyed,
schools are cstabllslicd and tho mass
cs given tho opportunity to adminis
ter their own affairs, riots and I ev
olutions will contlnuo and tho vaU
resources cannot bo developed by
Amorlcan capital.'
"Tho puro blooded Indians of
Mexico have tho latont talent to bo
capable business and professional
men and all thoy need is tho oppor
tunity. Present conditions aro In
tolerable and cannot go on .forever
Whether it Is tho proUdenco of God
that we, aro to right conditions m
that rich country wo do not know,
but I bollovo that It will bo tho des
tiny of tho-United StatCH to do to "
Mr, IvIiib knows moro about the
Mexican situation than any other man
in Utah, and we aro willing to stukt

pledged to support tho Carranza rov
ernmont In tho event of a break with
tho United States were circulated In
Juarez and to some extent In the
