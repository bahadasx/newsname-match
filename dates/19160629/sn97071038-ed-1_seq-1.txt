Pinches. Ruin Prevents "
Fast Ball.
Heppner ball tossers and fans
journeyed through 42 miles of all
kinds of weather last Sunday to take
a second fall out o the Condon ag
gregation. The return trip was made
through -only one kind of weather,
however. It rained iatorrents all
the way home.
As the umpire, our own Hugo Sie
bolds, started the game In motion,
rain drops began to gently fall and
almost throughout the entire two
hours of playing, Jupiter 'J Pluvius
showed his dtesust at the way the
Condon boys played ball.
Heppner was somewhat reinforced
by Hopkins, Rietraann and Cochran,
star infield men of the lone team.
Rletmann, playing in center, "-field,
succeeded In getting three hits out
of five times at bat. Cochran batted
five hundred per cent while Hopkins
got two walks. Fulwlder met the ball
tor a long drive on three ocasious but
Brown, who played a stellar game at
center field for Condon, pulled two of
them down.
Heppner started the scoring and
led all the way through. The teams

Trail Work Begins In Columbia
Gorge Park.
Portland, June 22--The Forest Ser
vice has a crew of sixteen men build
ing a new trail up the Eaglej Creek
Valley of the Columbia Gorge Park.
This" is in accordance with an announ
ment made today. Besides build
a number of camp sites In order to
make the recreational features of the
region available for public use.
This Eagle creek project is the first
of many developement plans to be
carried out for the 'park. The trail
will follow the Creek up the Oregon
National Forest, and then on to Wah
tum Lake. From the Lake there Is a
trail down Herman creek to the Her
man Ranger Station and the Colum
bia Highway, thus completing a
twenty-six mile loop. Parties wish
ing to make this loop trip can do so
in two days, camping over night at
Wahtum Lake. The Eagle Creek
work also contemplates other trails
to points of scenic Interest, and a
general preparing of the area for the
comfort and use of the public.
The whole area of the Columbia
Gorge Park consists of 14,000 acres
along the Columbia River between
Eagle Creek and Viento, which was
set aside last December by order of
the Secretary of Agriculture for the
permanent use of the public as a
recreation park. The full develop
ment of the park will take several
years, and will include picnic grounds
many camp sites and additional trails.
But it can be used this season in its
present state. A water supply has
been Installed and a sewer system
built. A ranger has been stationed
at Eagle Creek to look after the
grounds this season.

born in Monalian, county Tyrone, Ire
land, May 24th, 1876. She died in
the Portland Surgical hospital last
Friday night at 9:00 o'clock after a
short illness.
Mrs. Marshall was married at Ar
magh, county Armagh, Ireland, to
Mike Marshall, October 18, 1900, and
shortly after they came to the Uni
ted States, locating at Heppner. Since
their residence in Morrow county
they have lived on lower Willow
creek and at Caatle Rock, where Mr.
Marshall was engaged in the sheep
business at 'the time of Mrs. Mar
shall's death. None of her people
lived In this country.
Besides the husband, three child

age 14; Cathleen Susan, age 12; and
Robert James, 9 years old.
The funeral was held In this city

rick's Catholic church, Father Galla
gher of Columbia University, Port
land, conducting the services in the
absence of Father P. J. O'Rourke.
Burial was made in the Masonic

Mrs. Marshall was a woman loved
bv all who knew her. Her untimely
death is mourned by her wide ac
quaintance of .friends, and their
heartfelt sympathy goes out to the
bereaved family in their sad hour of
affliction.
RESOLUTIONS OF CONDOLENCE.
Whereas, It has pleased the Grand
Master of the Universe in his wisdom
to call from our midst our revered
nnd faithful brother Peter Borg; And
whereas. Brother Borg, for many
vears was a true and valued Citizen
of Heppner and a staunch and indom
itable seeker of truth, the rock on
which the great and fundamental
principles of Masonry from time lin
memorial have ever been founded.
Be It resolved, while we, as mem'
bers of Heppner Lodge No., 69, A. F.
& A. M. bow in humility to the de
cree of our Supreme and Omnipotent
Master on high, yet we nevertheless
deplore the loss of one who at all
times was at his post, a leader a
mnne men ' and Masons. His star
Is set on earth, His labors are ended
His seat la vacant, And his breathern
mourn.
Yet while we mourn for one so
dear our Borrow is tempered by an
abiding faith and hope, that the
bright star now set on earth, shall
arise again, arise to meet, and greet
his brethern in the great Beyond
where the great and lesser lights of
Masonry Bhall be more clearly re-
vealed to all.
To the family of Brother Borg we
hU fellow-craftB-men extend our
deepest sympathy in this hour of
grief and beg to assure them that we
fully share with them in this hour of
bereavement.
Resolved that these resolutions
be spread on our minutes, that a copy
thereof be sent by the secretary to

The farm home of Mr. and Mrs.
Frank Turner was badly wrecked i:i
a wind storm which visited this sec
tion about 12:30 last Monday after
noon. The house was turned almost
completely around and the interior
badly shaken up. The barn was com
pletely demolished.
Mrs. Turner and the children and
Sam Turner were in the house at the
time. That they escaped without in
jury is nothing short of marvelous.
A piece of the floor, driven by the
force of the wind, missed striking
Mrs. Turner by a narrow margin. She
and the children jwere brought to
town and Mrs. Turner is under the,

No other damage from the wind ln
this section is reported although It
touched ln parts of Umatilla county.
The Turner ranch Is located about
S miles northeast ot Heppner and is
probably better known as the old
WllUams place. Mr. Turner bought
the ranch about three years ago and
had made extensive Improvements
since then. Much ot his three years
ot labor was destroyed by Monday's
wind. The growing grain was beaten
into the ground and according to Mr.
Turner, it will not even make hay.
J. J. Hill's Newspaper Venture,
The empire builder" once ventur

few years ago he owned the St. Paul
Globe, says the editor and publisher.
Whatever may have been his pur
pose In controlling a daily paper, that
pui-pose failed. Mr. Hill killed the
Qlobe. He did not seek to realize a
peny on the sale ot even its machi
nery and fixtures. As we recall the
matter, he ordered these to be scrap
ped. He did not wish apparent!
to have the paper survive his owner
ship. He sought to erase It, even the
memory of It, and he succeeded.
The Globe had attained to influ
ence and prestige In the Northwest.
When Mr. Hill became its owner its
readers and supporters became sus
picious. They Inferred things. They
imputed motives. It the Globe ex-
presed an opinion upon a matter ot
public improvement, that opinion was
supposed to coincide with some in
terest of Mr. Hill's. The paper un
der his ownership was conducted on
broader lines than before.' It was

mountain air will be one of the
strongest attractions here.
Irrlgon has prepared a big parade
and a boy scout drill. A program of

be indulged in. One of the big at
tractions here, however, will be the
boating and swimming in the Co
lumbia river.
Quite a number of autoists are
planning to spend the day at the
forks of Willow creek. It Is proba
ble that a number will go to other
parts of the mountains. Many will
have to stay at home, so a dance may
be arranged for at the Fair pavilion

The paper was doomed..
It was doomed because It had been

The strange spectacle was presented
of a newspaper backed by limitless

a newspaper a force ln a commu

and the influence it exerted upon
their thought and opinion.
Realizing this and disgusted with
his adventure into the field of news
paper making, Mr. Hill killed the
Globe. Thereafter he sought public

the whole country.
Th case of the St: Paul Globe af

were necessary that a newspaper can
not exist, cannot grow, cannot earn
profits, unless it exists for public ser

doubts, any misgivings, on the part
of its readers as to the motive back
of such service. And therein lies the
security of a democracy, for an un
controlled press is indeed a democra

Falls Out of a Zeppelin.
London Cable to New York Times.
Curious things happen in war time,
but there has been nothing more
startling than that which happened
to a certain family which lives in a
town on the east coast of England.
Some days ago Zeppelins flew over
this port, which was nothing unusual.
The members of the household were
partaking of a late evening meal.
They heard bombs exploding and the
fire of anti-aircraft guns. Suddenly
there was a tremendous crash at the
back ot the house. Evidently some
thing tad dropped Into the conserva
tory. It was assumed that It was a
bomb. For a few minutes the people
remained where they werfe, fearing a
further explosion. Then they InveS'
tlgated.
In the conservatory, most ot the
glass of which was broken, they
found the body of a German airsail
or. He had evidently accidentally fal
len from a Zeppelin, or perhaps he
was knocked out by a well-placed
British shell. He had fallen a tre
mendous height, probably no less
than 7000 feet.
Sinn Takes Poison By Mistake.
The report reached Heppner Wed
nesday that Matt Reilley, formerly of
this place, was dead at Umatilla. The
report stated that he had taken
strychnine, believing it to be medi

one time and now has a brother here
who is working for John Kilkenny.
The body will be brought to Heppner
for burial.
Charley ' Wattenburger returned
the first of the week from Wallowa
county where he has been working
with his father's shearing crew.
There is some diversity of weather in
Wallowa county according to Charlie.
He was located 25 miles from Enter
prise. One night his tent fell down
under the weight of snow. That hap
pened on the 18th of June. Seven
miles from there, on the Imnaha, itie
cherries were ripe.

Oregon in 1878 and settled near Cor
vallis, later coming to Crook County
where he engaged in the sheep busi

moved to Morrow County, locating a
homestead near Ella. His wife and
a son and two daughters suffered
death in the burning of the store and
residence at Morgan station some
two years ago, and this left him alone
with but one remaining member of
his family, Mrs. Wate Crawford, with

This has certainly been a week of

the part of the farming end of th
community. Those along the creek
bottoms, however, are not quite so
well pleased as a number had hay
down and the wetting it has received
has done, it no good. It would seem
now that the grain crop is assured
and nothing short of a serious calam
Ity of some kind will prevent an
abundant yield. The rains have come
at an especially opportune time for
the spring sown grain, and this will
now develop Into a great crop. As
the greater portion of the grain is

from the heavy rains of the past few
days is incalcuable. So far as reports
have reached here, there has been do

CROPS BENEFIT
FROM REM Rl
Reports From Over County Indicate
Little Damage Done But Bump
er Crops Are Assured. Hail
Harms Very Little.
The heavy rain storm which visited
Morrow county the first tbree days ot
this week has benefitted the crops
greatly and will increase the yield
thousands of bushels. This is the
general report from over the county.
After the clouds had cleared away it
as found that no serious damage
had been done. '
About noon on Monday, Heppner .
as visited with a severe wind, rala
and hail storm and chunks of ice a
half-inch in diameter fell. Fruit
and garden stuff in town suffered
somewhat from this storm, but indi
cations are that the hail fell only ln
and near Heppner. Some excitement
was caused to residents of Chase
street when the water, several feet
deep came down Donaldson canyon.
The Chase street channel could not
carry all the water and as a result the
banks overflowed and a large portion
of the water ran down Chase street.
No damage was done by this, how
ever.
Probably the most serious loss sus
tained was to creek farmers who had
just cut their alfalfa and had not yet
got it ln the stack. Yet the damage
done on the creek was more than off
set by the great good done to the
grain on the hill. W. O. Minor, pro
prietor of the Mountain Valley Stock
Farm, states that for every ten cents
he was damaged he was benefitted a
dollar. He regrets very much that
reports have gone out as they have.
Farmers over the entire county are
jubilant. Crop prospects were never
better. One Eight Mile farmer said.
'this rain is the best thing that could
have happened; It has practically In-
sored 'a bumper crop and thegErlng,
sritlnTwhlcTf bad not grown fast on
account of the backward spring, will
probably make a better, crop now
than the fall-sown grain."
So far as reports go, the stock of
the county did not suffer from the
storm. Celsus Kelthley's milk cow
was caught in a draw where the wa
ter came down suddenly and she was
washed out Into the Willow creek
channel before she finally gof out.
The cow was cut by barbed wire, ac
cording to the report. .
Some damage was caused to roads
where the water came down the gul
lies and canyons, but such damaga as
lias been known in former years bas
not been reported.

contrived to accommodate themselves
to the inconveniences caused by em

gave words of encouragement to their
young men to serve their State and
