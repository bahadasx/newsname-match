One of the candidates for United
States Senator, who does not seem wil
ling to rest his candidacy his on merit,
has been flooding the state with the
duplicate of a telegram which he re
ceived from Frank H. Hitchcock,
thanking him for what he did to help
nominate Mr. Hughes at Chicago.
This is the same sort of a telegram
Hitchcock sent to many other Missouri
Republicans, most of whom had a good
deal more to do with lining up the
Missouri delegation for Hughes than
this senatorial candidate had. In (act,
tne latter didn t have anything to do
with getting the Missouri delegation
lor the winning candidate, for the rea
son that it wasn.t composed of hii po
litical friends. His attempt to hitch
himself up exclusively to the Hughes
boom m an appeal for the support ol
the pie-counter crowd which doesn't
(aborably impress Republicans whose
first object it to r)ut up the strongest
state ticket possible. The Missouri
delegation was chosen without refer
ence to candidates and with the pur
pose of conferring and consulting with;n0 rourchaser at the execution sales ex-
o ri2 i j.
iog what seemed best (or the party at
.he time aud nnder the condition,
prdsent-d. That was precisely what
was done.
Heard at the National Capital
tie Hon. James R Mann caused
much amusement among the members
of Congress and throughut the capitol
by the neat manner in which he trip
ped the Hon. Champ Clark of Missouri.
Speaker of the House. As sson as
Justice Hughes was nominated. Champ
rushed into print with a signed aritcle,
in which he criticised the Republican
party for "raiding the courts" for a
candidate. Mann took occasion to
point out the fact that Clark was the
presiding officer ol the Democratic
Convention that nominated Jude Alton
B. Parker ol Nw York in 1904, and
also Chairman ol the Committee on
notification. Champ wiih great earnest
ness at that time pointed out the fact
that Judge Parker was a great jurist
and that his official duties along this
line admirably fitted him for the re
sponsible duties ol President. Re
publican leader Mann so cleverly
turned the tables on the Speaker that
even the latter had to smile when it
was done.
Congressmen Cyrus Adams Sulloway
ol the first New Hampshire district has
recently returned from the Granite
State. Speaking of the political out
look in that section of the country, he
said: "New England is enthusiastic
for Hughe5 and Fairbanks. The nom
ination of Justice Hughes was especi
ally pleasing to our people. It means
a reunited party and as far as our group
ol six states is concerned, the only
thing to be considered is the sizi ol
the majority. Republicans everywhere
are enthusiastic and have a right to
be."
Never was disappointment more
plainly shown or more keenly felt about
the capitol than has been displayed br
the Democratic Congressman and Sen
ators at the recent Republican Nation
al Convention at Chicago. The dis
comfiture vf the rnemben ol that party
over the nomination ol Hughes was so
much in evidence that it was very
amusing to Republicans. The Demo
crats had banked and staked all their
hopes cn a big party row at Chicago
and when such a splendid outcome re
suited, tlie shock rame all the greater.
These are vry anxious days Inr many
Democratic statesmen, ncd from every
indication they will continue to grow
more so.
The Bureau of labor statistics of the
U. S. Department of Labor has pre
pared two tables showing changes in
number employed in ten manufactur
ing industries between April 1915 and
April 1916, and the size of the payroll
lor the same months. The administra
tion statisticians were careful not to
make a comparison with April 1914,
before the European war broke out,
when the laboring man sat on the park
bench, sporting the Democratic em
blcm, a patch on the bosom of his
dungarees, and fortified his inner man
at the soup-cart and in the bread line.
Through letters and news dispatch
es that reach Washington from all parts
olthe country, it is evident that pracli
cally all former members of the Pro
gressive party are now back in the Re -
publican ranks. Even before the
Chicago Convention, it was apparent
from registration of voters in the sev
eral states, and from elections, that
nearly all the rank and file of the Pro
gressives had returned to their (ormer
party affiliation. A few of th,e (ormer
Progressive leaders were still holding
out, but since the nomination ol
Hughes, even these have given up
hope of a future (or the Bull Moose
party, and have united with their old
time political associates in the effort to
drive tn incompetent administration
out of power.
Unprotected Industries
"No price (or property, no sales ex
cept those of the Sheriff and Marshal,
, , . .
i W, no employment (or industry;
' 00 demand for labor; no sales (or the
products of the (arm; no sound of the
hammer except that of the auctioneer
knocking down property," is the de-
scription Thorn, s Benton, a Democrat,
gives of the situation in this country at
the clcs? of the Napoleonic wars when
Europe deluged our markets with her
goods.
II a Republican authority is preferred,
here is what Horace Greely said on the
subject: "Great Britain poured her
fabrics, far below cost, upon our mar
kets in a peifect deluge. Our manu
facturers went down like grass before
the mowir; agriculture and wages lor
labor speedily followed. Financial
pio .tration was general and the presence
ol debt was universal."
Even President Wilson, in his hist
ory, takes cognizance ol tne situation
at that time and says, (see volume
three) "It was manifestly injurious to
every young industry that a Hood ol
English imports should continue to
pour into the country at the open ports.
The remedy was a protective tariff,
such as Mr. Hamilton had wished to
see at fust, and the young Republican
leaders of Congress did not hesitate to
advocate and establish it."
Whatever President Wilson knows
as a student of history, the Democratic
Party does not believe in Protection.
The present Democratic tariff law af
fords no Protection to the industries of
the country. Today they are protect
ed only by the war now in progress on
the other side of the Atlantic. If that
war ends with the present tariff law
still in operation, American industries
must expect to fight for their very ex
istence. Yonkers N. Y. Statesman.
This is going to be a republican year,
providing of course that the right sort
of candidates are nominated for the
various offices. The office ol Congress
man from this district is a most im
portant one, and the voters should be
sure they have a man who not only
can deleat the democratic candidate,
but who after he is elected will be able
to give to the republicans of the Four
teeuth district that service to which
they are entitled, and Irom which they
hive been barred lor sevrr.il ears.
There is no question but what the next
president will be a republican. That
is conceded by all who have given the
matter serious consideration at all.
Now what would a democratic con
gressman be able to do for his people
back home with a republican president?
Nothing absolutely nothing. All he
could possibly do would be to draw
his salary, for which he would give
no return. In David W. Hill of Poplar
Bluff, the people have a champion who
not only can be elected this fail, but
he is ol the caliber that will get some
thing (or the people of his districts
While of course the meeting is not
out until the singing is over, yet from
indications over the district Mr. Hill
seems to have the best of the situation
to such an extent that his n mination
is assured, and if he is nominated as
is thought by a great many leaders in
various parts of the district he will be
elected. There are so many good
j things, things that have meant a great
deal to the whole state of Missouri
that he did when speaker of the Mis
souri legislature, that to enumerate
them would take a large book. He is
built of the right kind of material that
will stand the acid test. Those who
know him, and there are a great many
over the district that do believe in him,
and believe that he will give the tax
payers ol tne rourteemn sometmng
Lke results for the money that they
pay to maintain the , government.
Poplar Bluff Republican '
It is remaraable that the Democratic
platform of 1916 omits the declaration
made in 1912 that our pledges are
made to be kept when in office as well
as to be relied upon during thi cam
paign." What a shout ol laughter
I , . . .u
, would have arisen all over the country
if that assurance had been repea'ed in
1916.
