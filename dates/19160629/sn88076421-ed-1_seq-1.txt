NORTH DAKOTA SUES
BOMG STATE
FOR tlMOOO
Mate of MhuMMta Is Made Defendant
it Sail in U. S. Supreme Court for
Drainage Ditch Damage
The State of Minnesota is made de­
fendant in a damage suit for $1,250,
000, started by the State of North Da­
kota in the United States supreme
court.
Payment of $1,250,000 to farmers in
Richmond and adjoining counties by
the defendant state, abandonment of
the Mustinka drainage ditch, the
source of the trouble, and the literal
Eture
inalizating of the Minnesota legis
is asked by the plaintiff state
The suit is the outcome of several
years of grief and verbal warfare by
the North Dakota farmers to the west
of the junction of the drainage ditch
and the Bois de Sioux river and Lake
Traverse.
The farmers on the Minnesota side
of the lake and river complained of
swamps, while the North Dakota^ farm­
ers were content in getting their irri­
gation from the skies direct.
TTien, in 1911, the Minnesota legis­
lature, acting for the depressed Min­
nesota farmers, authorized the con­
struction of drainage ditches, known
as the Mustinka ditch, to drain the
swamps into Lake Traverse and the
Bois de Sioux river.
The banks of the river and the lake,
however, are shallow. The water
which the Minnesota farmers thus be­
came rid of swelled the heights of the
lake to a veritable tidal waye, a wave
which swept the sorrounding territory
on the North Dakota side.
Crops were ruined by the man-made
flood, the Dakota farmers allege, and
lands were thus rendered useless.
These lands, they aver, have since re­
mained useless and raise nothing.
For nine months Attorney General
H. J. Linde .of North Dakota, working
with ex-Governor John Lind of Minne­
sota and M. H. Boutell, Minneapolis
attorney, have been gathering data on
tlie situation, and he filed the suit in
the States supreme court.
IbUnited
addition to the damage, he fur
tilBV 5LtlfS
**That the defendant, the State of
Minnesota, be enjoined against an un­
lawful and damaging trespass upon
lbs domain of the State of North Da­
kota and the property of its citizens.
More than 12,000 acres have been
rained through the construction of the
Minnesota ditch, the complaint states,
and for this the State of North Da­
kota asks $1,000,000 for the farmers
and $150,000 for the loss of crops in
1915 and $100,000 for the inability to
use the land in 1916 are also asked.

STOCK SHOW TO
BE HELD NEXT WEEK
Promises to be One of Best Events of
Kind to be Held in the State
Minot will be the Mecca of the live
stock men of the northwestern portion
of the state next week. They will be
attracted to this city by the first an­
nual Stock Show, and at this writing
it looks as if they will get their fill of
seeing one of the best shows ever
pulled off in the state. It is indeed
gratifying to the Association of Com­
merce to note the large number of
an tries, not only from the Northwest­
ern part of the state, but from close to
the eastern line of the state, and al
•eady arrangements are being made to
tocrease the stall room in the Curling
Rink, that will be used for the show.
Carpenters are now at work remod
rftag the interior of the Rink, and
when their work is completed those
who used the rink during the winter
will not recognize the place.
Every day will be a Dig* day. Be­
ginning Monday, July 3, and ending
Saturday evening, July 8, there will
not be a dull moment.
The show will be an added attrac­
tion for the monster Fourth of July
eelebration that will be held in the city
on Tuesday. The rink is close to Riv­
erside Park, where the celebration will
be held.
On Saturday there will be an auc­
tion sale held at the rink. This will be
a splendid opportunity for breeders to
dispose of some of their stock if they
wish to, and also a fine opportunity
for farmers who are thinking of
strengthening their herds to get some
fresh stock.
This show is sort of an experiment,
to see if the stock breeders of the
northwestern part of the state are in­
terested sufficiently to make the show
an annual affair, and ultimately lead­
ing up to a district fair to be neld at
Minot every year. The Midwinter
Fair, held during February each year
Do Your Shopping Saturday and Monday.
has proven that the farmers are inter­
ested in exhibiting grains and grasses,
and with a successful stock show this
year it would be an easy matter to get
the district fair under way. It might
take two years to do this, but it can
be done, providing the proper interest
is shown.
Entries are now coming in rapidly,
and even the eastern part of the state
is becoming aroused, and breeders'
from the Red River Valley are plan
i»ia£ to come to Minot next week with
their prize animals. The breeders from
this part of the state will welcome
these entries, for it will give them an
opportunity to see whether they are
on the right track or not.
The Curling Rink is one of the larg­
est buildings in the state, and will be
an ideal live stock pavilion. The hogs
and sheep will have sheltered pens
outside of the rink and everything pos­
sible done to show them up in first
class shape.
All breeders intending to exhibit at
the Northwestern Stock Show should
send in their entry blanks at once to
Secretary Will E. Holbein, Minot, N.

Last Week for the Iconoclast
It is reported that this is the last
week that the Iconoclast will be pub­
lished. This is the organ for the so­
cialist party in North Dakota. The
Nonpartisan league has put a terrible
crimp in the party in this state and
the business of the Iconoclast which
at one time was quite large, has been
dwindling gradually until the publish­
ers report that it is no longer a paying
proposition.
DAKOTA
REGIMENT IN CAMP
AT FORT LINCOLN
Co. D. of Minot and Co. E. of Willis
ton Were the Last to Get Into
Camp—Co. D. Largest
First Lieutenant F. Otto Gross and
Privates Selberg and Oesk, who re­
mained behind Co. to receive re­
cruits at the Armory, reoeived their
orders and transportation Tuesday and
Thursday morning left for Fort Lin­
coln to join their company. Accom­
panying them were 20 recruits who
joined Monday.
Company has been recruited to
133 members and is the largest com­
pany in the North Dakota regiment.
Private Leslie Dunn, who nas been
at New Rockford, accompanied Lieut.
Gross Wednesday.
It is believed that the North Dakota
regiment will receive orders to go
south the latter part of the week.
The Independent has made arrange­
ments for a weekly news letter from
camp and we will keep our readers in­
formed as to the happenings.
The members of the regiment are
all anxious to get into service as quick­
ly as possible. They will go into camp
along the border and will soon be in
shape for the Mexican campaign if
they are ordered across the border.
With but six days' rations drawn,
there are rumors that the regiment
will be ordered south before the end of
the week.
With Companies and E getting in­
to camp at six o'clock Sunday night,
the entire regiment numbering 975
men went into hard training. With
additional recruits arriving, the reg­
iment now numbers more than 1000
men.
Company A of Bismarck was first on
the ground. Co. of Mandan and
of Valley City, of Fargo, of
Jamestown with the band and hospi­
tal corps moved into camp. The train
on which Co. of Grafton, of
Grand Forks, the machine gun com­
pany of Grand Forks, of Hillsboro
and I of Wahpeton arrived at 4 o'clock
Sunday.
There was considerable confusion
accompanying the first day's work.
There *19 a general shortage of equip­
ment, mostly tents and some of the re­
cruits were without uniforms.
The captains of the companies re­
ceive $300 a month. First Lieutenants
$1S6, Second Lieutenants $152, Duty
Sargeant $30, First Sargeant $45, and
Porder,
rivates $18. In ease they cross the
they will receive 20 per eent
more.
INDIAN WARRIOR READY TO
FIGHT FOR STARS AND STRIPES
Mandan, N. D., June 26.—"An old
Indian am I, but no white man loves
his country more. If my country needs
me and I can serve in any way my life
is not so dear but that I too will lay
it down for the flag we have learned to
love."
This is the translation of a speech
in pure Sioux made at a flag-raising
ceremony at Fort Rice Saturday by
Red Tomahawk, an old Indian scout.
BOND IS GRATEFUL
I take this opportunity of thanking
my friends who worked in my behalf
during the primaries. Irrespective of
the results, I shall always feel under
obligations to them.
Respectfully,
WALTER R. BOND.
Says I. W. W.'s Demand $5 a Day
L. J. Renicker of Norwich reurned
from Haviland, Kan., where he was
the guest of his brother, who is pub­
lisher of the Haviland Onlooker. Three
of his brothers who had not met for a
decade gathered and had a most enjoy­
able visit. Mrs. Renicker accompan­
ied her husband on the trip. They had
been attending the annual meeting of
the German Baptist church at Fair
view. Mo. Mr. Renicker says he had
heard so much about the fine crops of
Kansas but failed to see them. Land
in the vicinity where he visited is sell­
ing from $100 to $150 an acre but out
own land will produce finer crops. Most
of the crops were drowned out this
year. He says the I. W. W.'s have or­
ganized in Kansas and are demanding
$5 a day and do not care whether they
work even at that figure. The farm­
ers are getting ready to harvest their
crops, such as they are.
THE WARD COUNTY INDEPENDENT
M'COY WILL INSTALL
FURNITURE STORE
Bought Lots, Will Build Large Brick
Block—President and General
Manager $50,000 Corporation
Paul V. McCoy purchased Lots 17
and 18 in Block 10, just north of the
Epstein grocery store on South Main
street, and will proceed at once to erect
a large two-story block with basement,
50x140 feet. The building will be com-
Ee
leted not later than Oct. 1, when it will
occupied by the new $50,000 corpor­
ation which has just been organized
with Paul V. McCoy, Geo. A. McGee
and Clarence Parker as the incorporat­
ors. Mr. McCoy is the president and
general manager of the new company
which will place in the new building
an immense stock of furniture and
house furnishings. L. C. Cooksey, who
has been manager of the Furniture
Exchange, has been engaged as assist­
ant manager. He will leave for Chi­
cago and Grand Rapids, Mich., in a
day or two to place his orders for the
stock and the intentions are to open
the store about Oct 1.
Mr. McCoy, the president of the
company, is one of Minot's most suc­
cessful business men, being interested
in half a dozen or more enterprises,
all of which are very successful. It is
safe to say that this venture will prove
to be an unqualified success. Mr. Mc­
Coy has been planning on this for sev­
eral years and feels that the time is
now ripe to engage in this business.
Mr. McCoy will go east next week to
join Mr. Cooksey and assist in buying
the stock. He plans on conducting a
cash and payment business.
While the building will consist of
but two stories at present, a founda­
tion will be built capable of extending
it up four stories.
North Prairie vs. Mosquitos
The north prairie team and the Mos­
quitoes played one of the fastest
games of the season last Sunday. The
game resulted in the North Prairie's
team winning by a score of 5 to 2. The
features of the gaj»e were two home
runs by Joe Pitner and Billy Laskow
sky, each getting one. Bill Dersey se­
cured a two-bagger. Henry Kells,
pitcher fsr the North Prairie boys, did
some mighty effective work. T^ie bew­
are 10 to 1 that North Prairie wins
the Fourth of July game from South
Prairie.
Rolling Green Township Has a Band
Rolling Green township has a band,
organized a month ago with the fol­
lowing members: Horace Davy, lead- I
or Victor Davy, Harold Waggoner,
Stanley Waggoner, Seth Coffey, Em­
met Davis, William and Fred Gronin
ger.
The organization is composed of
members who have never had much
musical experience, but they are dem­
onstrating that they know how to
handle a trombone just about as well
as they can a plow and will soon be
ready to make their debut. Their rep­
ertoire will not be so very extensive
this season bat they will undoubtedly
give a good asconnt of themselves.
Two So as Join Company D.
Henry and Jesse McLean, sons of
Mr. ana Mrs. Samuel McLean, who re­
side at 80S Valley street in this city,
have both joined Co. and are now at
Fort Lincoln where the regiment is
being organized. This is the first in­
stance that has been called to our at­
tention where two members from the
same family have enlisted in the same
company so far, in the pending un­
pleasantness. The scene at the depot
this morning when Jesse, the younger
son, took leave of his aged mother and
father and his two little sisters was
very touching indeed. There is but
one son left at home, and he is anxious
to enlist, but the mother is unwilling
to part with the young man, saying
that two sons should be a sufficient
sacrifice to lay upon the altar of our
country—and none will deny the jus­
tice of her claim. Both Mr. and Mrs.
McLean are devoted patriots and this
act of devotion to their country's cause
gives the citizens of our city much rea­
son to feel proud of the McLeans.

OUR SOLDIER BOYS
OEf TO THE
WAR
Immense Crowd Pays Tribute to the
Members of Co. and Co. E Upon
Departure for Ft. Lincoln Sunday
One of the largest crowds that ever
gathered on the streets of Minot paid
a glowing tribute to the "boys" of Co.
on their departure for the mobiliza­
tion camp at Fort Lincoln Sunday
morning. The special train over the
Soo was scheduled to pull out prompt­
ly at nine o'clock, but it was nearer
ten before the coaches bearing the
members of Co. of Minot and Co. E
of Wiiliston steamed away amid the
cheers of thousands and prayers for
their safe return.
The company appeared on the street
at 8 o'clock, and shortly after the train
bearing the Wiiliston boys arrived.
Headed by the Minot band the soldier
boys marched through the streets and
they were cheered by every man. wo­
man and child with red blood in their
veins. The boys stood "at rest" ful­
some time while the members of their
families and other friends bade them
good-bye and many who were complete
strangers passed along the line, bid­
ding them farefell.
The Minot band played a number of
patriotic airs and as the train was
pulling out the band struck up "The
Girl I I^ft Behind Me."
The Knights of Columbus marched
in a body to the station, paying a
splendid tribute to the departing com­
pany. Ten of the Co. boys are mem­
bers of the K. C. Council.
Shortly before the boys boarded the
train. Judge Palda gave a short ad­
dress which brought forth frequent
applause. He told the boys that should
they be sent across the border to re­
member that this is a civilized coun­
try and although we might be called
to fight a lot of savages, we should
fight like men, and at the same time
fight like Hades.
The whole city was alive at seven
o'clock Sunday morning and many
gathered at the Great Northern depot
to meet Co. E of Wiiliston when the
train pulled in. Company marched
to the depot and fell in behind the Wii­
liston company which was in charge of
Captain Evans.
Every member of the two companies
were presented with a red and white
carnation each by Geo. E. Valker, the
Minot florist.
The doctors of the city presented
Captain Frank E. Wheelon of Co.
with a beautiful gold wrist watch the
evening before his departure. Captain
Wheelon for years has been one of Mi­
not's popular physicians and surgeons.
The watch was suitably engraved.
Silk flags were presented by Mrs.
Day Okes, Mrs. L. D. McGahan, Miss
Peggie Clapp, Miss Ruth Carroll, Miss
Aileen McGahan and Miss Bertha Alp
stag.
Knights of Columbus rings were pre­
sented to Corporal Hugh Taylor, Pri­
vate Leo S. Kigin and Private H. Lar
idaen by the local council of that or­
ganization.
The city of Minot contributed to the
Co. relief fund in a highly commend­
able manner. The committee raised
more than a thousand dollars by pub­
lic subscription which with the $13P
as receipts from the Lyceum enter­
tainment Friday night and the ball at
the armory, amounted to $1500. This
will be used in equipping the company
with a library and with an outfit for a
gymnasium and for luxuries for sick
members. Tt is only a little remem­
brance from our citizens but is appre­
ciated by all the boys who have gone
to fight our battles if called upon.
Before the train departed, Captain
Wheelon issued the following state­
ment:
"On behalf of myself and the other
officers and the men of Company D, I
wish to express to the people of Minot
the gratitude of us all for the mag­
nificent manner in which the city and
its citizens have shown their appreci­
ation of the men who are going out to
serve their country wherever duty
calls them.
"The men who have enlisted in Co.
and the men who were members of
it before the recruiting orders were is­
sued realize they are going on no lark.
They understand the seriossness of
the task for the accomplishment of
which they have entered into a con­
tract sealed with the pledge of their
lives.
Company is the same company
and will be a part of the same regi­
ment which served with honor to the
nation and the flag in the Philippines.
The men have changed, but the fight­
ing spirit is a tradition of the com­
pany and of the regiment, and those
who have bid the company 'Godspeed'
today will have no apologies to make,
no explanations to offer for its record,
no matter where it may be called. The
helpless will learn to respect Company
because of its protection and the
enemy will respect it because of its
fighting qualities.
Minot will be heard from wherever
the company may go, and the loyalty
and sympathy of the thousands who
have come out to bid us goodbye will
be an inspiration for the best service
and the noblest purposes of every
ipan."
The special train was decorated in
the national colors. At every station
between Minot and Bismarck it was
Stores Closed Tuesday, July 4th.
I met by a large crowd. At Velva a
large number of citizens and the band
turned out. At Max the citizens and
Boy Scouts were out. At Wilton the
citizens presented the boys with an en­
tire case of cigars. At Drake the cit­
izens presented the soldiers with a
huge pennant bearing the emblem—
"America, We Love You."
KENMARE TO HAVE A
MONSTER CELEBRATION
Kenmare is preparing for another
monster celebration on July 4-5, and
extends a cordial invitation to the peo­
ple of this vicinity to attend. The out­
standing feature this year will be the
great aeroplane exhibition, guaranteed
to be the best ever brought into the
state. Baxter Adams is the birdman,
and he will loop the loop, fly upside
down, and do all the other hair-rais­
ing stunts known to the game. He
will make two flights, one in the morn­
ing, shortly before dinner, and the
other late in the afternoon.
Besides the above the Cash-Hine
Carnival company will be on hand both
days, there will be ball games, street
sports, dancing, free attractions, music
and everything that goes to make up
a first class celebration.
Every attraction this year is under
bond, and there is absolutely no possi­
bility of disappointment.
Fire at Windsor Hotel
The fire laddies responded to a cali
Wednesday just before noon when an
overheated range in the kitchen
the Windsor hotel started a blaze in
the wall. The fire was pui. out befoiv

who is widely known in the musical
circles of this city, was the capable ac­
companist.
A very largs crowd turned out in the
evening to the concert.

founded in 1888 and haa 35 confirmed
members. Tile first officers were: Hans
Fjone, Louis Larson and Carl L. Op
sahl, trustees A. J. Olsie, secretary,

gation erected a parsonage costing
$4,000.

MINOT WANTS YOU
FOR HER GUEST
ON THE EOURTH
Committees Have Planned Big Things
For the Celebration—to Spend
$2,000 for Various Prizes
1
Arrangements are completed for
Minot's greatest Fourth of July cele
1 bration and now that all the citizens
of Minot ask for is fair weather and
good roads. Last year 20,000 people
attended the celebration and went
away declaring that they never had
been treated more royally in their
ilives. This year the crowd will be
even larger if the weather is favorable.
A thousand or fifteen hundred automo­
biles will be in the city that day. Many
will drive in from distant points.
Places will be provided for parking
the cars and for hitching the horses at
Riverside park.
Riverside Park, where the main cel
jebration will be held, never appeared
as beautiful as it does today. New
walks and driveways have been laid
out. Lawns have been seeded and
many flowers and much shrubbery
planted. The grass has been cut and
the entire grounds present a fresh, in­
viting appearance. The three elk have
been turned into their new wire en­
closure and the bear with the three
cubs will be one of the real attractions.
Thousands will bring their pienic
dinners and spread them in the shade
of the trees. The committee will pro
vide free coffee but it will be well to
br.ng buckets.
There will bo some attraction for
practically every minute in the day.
There will be band concerts, a patriotic
program at the park in the morning.
Pres. A. G. Crane and R. A. Nestos are
the speakers.
The ball game between the North
Prairie Cubs and the South Prairie
Colts will take place at Riverside
Park in the afternoon, the winners to
carry away a $50 purse. The boys
are all husky sluggers and they will
fight like Trojans for the purse and
honors.
In another section of this issue will
be found the complete program telling
all about the races, etc. TTie commit­
tee will spend $2,(K)0 on this celebra­
tion and some unusually large prizes
are offered.
During the evening the Minot ball
team will cross bats with the fast Car
rington team at the ball park. This is
one of the very few attractions for
which an admission will be charged,
this being entirely out of the hands of
the committee.
During the afternoon and evening,
there will be free dancing at a pavilion
at Riverside Park and in the evening
a gorgeous display of fireworks will
be given from the south hill.
In the evening there will be a mirth
provoking carnival with dancing on
the pavement, following the Calithum
pian parade. If you want to see some
real sport, don't miss this parade.
The automobile and motorcycle pa­
rade will be one of the big events of
the day.
The local theaters, with a boat ride
up the river to Wildwood or the base­
ball amusement park will furnish
amusement to many. There will be
so much going on throughout the day
that you won't be able to participate
in half of it.
FOR THE FOURTH
Committee Adds Another Attraction—
Offering Good Prizes—There
Will be Many Entries
There are so many riders of motor­
cycles who are anxious to be repre­
sented in the parade on the Fourth,
that the committee has arranged for a
contest, offering prizes of $15 and $S
for the two motorcycles decorated i*
the most unique and most attractive
manner. This will be pulled off in ad­
dition to the big automobile parade for
which prizes of $50. $25 and $15 are
offered.
It is hoped that a large number of
machines in each event will be entered
as the prizes are surely worth working
for.
Farmers Looking for "Eye Specialist"
A man who claimed to be an eye
specialist, or a specialist at fitting
glasses, visited in the country north of
Minot a month ago, taking orders for
glasses. He called himself Layman
and said his headquarters were in Mi­
not. He fitted out Mrs. J. C. Kim of
Maxbass with glasses, Mr. Kirn giving
a check for $14. Another farmer paid
him $28. He stated that the glasses
would be sent in a week, but to data
they have not been received. The In­
dependent has made inquiries and we
fail to locate this man if he is her§.
He may not be a fake but the people
who gave him their orders are becom­
ing anxious. It is always better to deal
with reputable oculists.
