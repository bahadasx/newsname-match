SUBSCRIPTION: S1.50PER YEAR IN AQVANGL
WILLWILSONOR HUGHES
BE ELECTED?
The Chippewas of Minnesota, if
they ^hoild all vote, have a suffi
cient number of votes to be effec
tive in this state, if the vote is
close, and they should cast it for
either Wilson or Hughes.
Had Col. Roosevelt been nomi
nated, it is quite probable that the
Indian vote would have been cast
for him, at least a large majority
of the Indians would no doubt
have voted for him. Now there is
a decided indifference to either
party among the Chippewas, for
those upon whom they could have
relied were not nominated by the
Republicans for Congress. A
very large majority of the Chip
pewas had hoped that Sen. Clapp,
Ed. Rogers and Mr. Anderson
would be nominated.
Congressman Miller was the
only Chippewa friend, so far as
known, who was nominated, ftfid
hemay draw the Indian vote with
him largely to the Republican
party.
On the other hand, Dan W.
Lawler, who is in some manner
related to the Dousman family of
Prairie du Chien, and therefore
related to the LaCbappelle family
of this reservation, may, through
these connections, pull a large In
dian vote for himself. Besides this,
Mr. Lawler has many acquaint
ances and old friends here who
will work for him for personal
reasons, and, probably, for his
party.
There is no doubt that "Ameri
canism" will be the watchword
with the Democratic party during
the present presidential campaign,
and this issue may elect President
Wilson.
Positions To Be Filled,
The amendment in the Indiun
appropriation ace which became a
law on May 18th last, is very
specific regarding the employment
of Chippewas of Minnesota to till
positions in the Chippewa Indian
aervice in this state, and is as fol
lows:
"That not to exceed $60,000 of
said amount, and the one fourth in
terest on the tribal funds of the
Chippewa Indians of Minnesota
now to their credit in the Treas
ury to be used for the mainte
nance of free schools, shall be used
for the compensation of employees
in the Indian service in Minnesota
except for irregular laborers, and
that the said Chippewas shall re
ceive the preference in filling per
maaent positions in the service of
the Chippewas of Minnesota where
the compensation is paid from
Jtheir tribal funds."
^J, the superintendent's office
liere. clu"uve of the superintend
ent, *tfcr are several clerkships
^nd they ail become available, ex
cepting the on* which is filled by
William Daily, who is a member
of the Chippewa of Minnesota
',bands, after the fimt of next
xmonth.
Jhe members of this reserva-
n*rv fl^urr- *n**" 1'"^".^'=
tion, or any other Chippewa of
Minnesota who is competent to fill
any of the positions, should apply
for them.
The Indian office at Washington
may raise the issue that applicants
for positions must pass the civil
rowt service examination, but under the
terms of the amendment this is
not required, and Washington at
torbeys to whom the matter was
submitted while the Indian act
was pending- before Congress were
of the opinion that competency,
under existing law, was all that is
necessary.
Applicants for positions should
not fail to submit their applica
tions to the meeting of the Gen
eral Council at Bemidji next
month for endorsement, and the
council will then be able to make
an issue of any objections that
may arise against the fulfillment
of the amendment to give mem
bers of the Chippewas of Minne
sota bands preference as employ
ees.
It is learned that the superin
tendent of this reservation is be
ing paid from the amount of $1,000
which is appropriated under the
treaty of 1867 for the support of
schools. If this is true the ap
propriation is being diverted from
its proper use.
Ex-Supt. Howard Still
Stirring Up Trouble.
When it was learned that Ex
Supt Howard would be relieved
from the position he held, an inti
matian was also made that he
would continue in the service in
another capacity not connected
with the Chippewas. To this there
was no objection from the Chip
pewa delegates that were at Wash
ington and who were opposed to
him. Upon their return to this
reservation, much to their sur
prise they learned that Mr. How
ard was still retained in the Chip
pewa Indian service, or in regard
to matters connected with the
Chippewas.
It is learned further, from what
is rpgarded as a reliable source,
that Howard, since he has been in
hid present position, urged and en
couraged opposition to the appro
priation for the meeting of the
General Council of the Chippewas
of Minnesota, and when he heard
that this appropriation was not
going to be made, he said he would
come to this reservation and cele
brate the event with the ware
jj0s er s#
Defective Page
Ex-Supt. Howard is like Ex
Supt. McFetridge of the Blackfeet
reservation in Montana, he is re
luctant to give up the power which
the Indian office vested in him,
and continues to stir up all the
trouble he can upon this reserva
tion.
As long as Howard remains con
nected with the Chippewa Indian
service Attorney Kearful will have
a most difficult task to settle mat
ters here upon this reservation.
Clarence B. Miller Re
nominated,
Congressman Miller, of Duluth,
was renominated for Congress last
week, and as the district he repre
sents is strongly Republican, his
election is assured.
Mr. Miller is Minnesota's "live
wire" in the House of Representa
tives and his Indian constituents
will have no reason to regret his
renomination, for he will no doubt
continue to look after their inter
ests in Congress in the future as
he has done in the past.

THE TOMAHAWK
Defeat Of Senator Clapp
Keen Disappointment To
The Chippewas,
From expressions heard arouud
here among the members of this
reservation Senator Clapp's fail
ure to secure a renomination is a
keen disappointment to them re
gardless of their former party
affiliations.
Senator Clapp has been the
staunchest friend the Indians ever
had in Congress from this state,
and within the next two years
tbey will more fully realize this.
It is doubtful whether the sen
ator himself cared much for his
renomination, and it was only at
the earnest solicitation of his many
friends that he finally filed as a
candidate, but after he did this he
could not be induced to leave his
duties at Washington for the pur
pose of coming to this state and
campaigning. For'this reason he
placed himself at a great disad
vantage as his opponents were on
the ground with strong financial
support and speaking at every
point in the state.
At the instigation of Republican
politicians, the leading newspapers
of the state were againso Senator
Clapp for supporting Col. Roose
velt and the Progressive Republi
can ticket four years ago, and this
fight has been kept up constantly
against him since then.
If the Republicans, who sup
ported the Progressive Republican
ticket four years ago, are to be
punished by the Stand-oat Repub
licans as Senator Clapp has been,
they may probably continue to
hold up their organization and
continue in the field as a regular
party, at least they should do this.
The White Earth Ware
house System.
The warehouse system of the
government upon the Chippewa
reservations in this state is one of
the most pernicious of the whole
Indian service, and especially the
system as it has been conducted
here.
It has been the custom to cover
all the shortages of agents, super
intendents and warehouse clerks
by charging to some ignorant In
dian an ihsue he never received.
From a brief and casual examin
ation of the warehouse issues at
the warehouse here, we learned
that fraudulent issues bad been
charged to persons to whom they
were never issued.
A most searching investigation
of the warehouse methods as they
have been kept here during the
past six or seven yoars would
show that the superintendent's
office has been reeking with
frandulently charged issues, and if
this administration wishos to
cleanse itself of such methods, it
should call all the persons to whom
issues have been charged and
question them personally regard
ing the matter.
The late Chief Supervisor Hoi
combe issued an order to ex-Supt.
Howard to tfive each of the Mille
Lac Indians to whom issues had
been charged copies of the issues
charged to each one, and in all but
one instance he failed to do this,
and this was the case of chief
Wah-we-yea cumig who has stated
repeatedly that some of the items
charged had not been received by
him, and there is every evidence
outside of his statement that this
was true.
Truth before Favor."
White Earth, Becker County, Minnesota, Thursday, June 29, 1916.
ja^vrt*
Only by such an investigation
as suggested will the members of
this reservation generally be satis
fied that efforts are being made to
correct the evils of the system.
In any event the system should
be abolished as was promised by
the commission which negotiated
with the Chippewas for their as
sent to the Act of January 14,
1889, and which even then was
known to be the worst part of the
Indian service.
THE GOVERNMENT
SHOULD BDILD THE
LIGHT PLANT,
Under the provisions of the last
Indian appropriation act an ap
proprmtion of $10,000 was made
for an electric light plant at this
place, for the agency and school
buildings, and for this town.
In this connection the building
of the plant should be by the gov
ernment, and not by contract un
der the usual methods of letting
contracts, namely by Mr. Durmet
invariably to one person who will
not pay members of the tribe the
same wages as to whites.
Mr. Durmet is quoted as saying
that members of the tribe are cap
able of earning only one dollar
and fifty cents per day, and this is
all that he will allow them to be
paid. Mr. Durmet receives pne
huaire dollars--, per month for
what he is supposed to do, and
from personal observation
know young men of this reserva-
i.._.
tion who are better qualified by
education to hold the position he
holds than he is, who have worked
at digging trenches for the mere
pittance of one dollar and fifty
cents per day.
Mr. Durmet's rise from team
ster to issue clerk of the agency
here, through the grace of John
Howard, was rapid, and when he
confines the compensation of mem
bers of this reservation to one dol
lar and fifty cents per day al
though they are working for their
own money and paying him his
salary, he should bear in mind that
their work is of more value to the
tribe than his is.
If the government should build
the electric light plant here, every
effort should be made by the In
dians to induce the Indian office
to place the work in the hands of
an experienced, capable electrician
who should have full charge of the
work to the entire exclusion of
Durmet, since this seems to be the
sentiment of the members of this
reservation.
Come in and look
over our line of
Ly Cy
No Change In The
Atmosphere.
Members of this reservation
who have taken occasion to call at
the office of the superintendent of
this reservation, say there is ap
parently no change in the atmos
phere of the office among the em
ployees who were there under the
Howard administrations- that the
same chillinpss is observed among
those employees that existed while

Howard was there towards mem
bers of the progressive faction.
It is net known whether Supt.
Ihnton encourages this or not, but
if he does not, he suould put his
foot down and show some deter
mination and not allow the issue
clerk to continue to be the real
superintendent as he was during
the Howard administration.
Edward L. Warren
Stricken.
Edward Warren, a member
of this reservation, who is now in
business at Federal Dam in this
state, was j-tricken with apploplexy
about ten days ago, and a tele
gram reached Mrs. Sophia War
ren, his mother, informing her of
this. She and another son, Henry
Warren, immediately left for
Federal Dam.
The latest reports bring the in
formation that Mr. Warren is
slightly improved, but not out of
danger. MERIT BARBER SHOP
