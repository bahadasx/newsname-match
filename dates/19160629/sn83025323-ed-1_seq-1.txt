friends came to enjoy the blessings
of the day and show their interest in
the church. Mrs. I'lyssa i. it tuer

Editor iDan B. McGovern Writes In
terestiAgg Account of tile start
of 'o. G. FIrom Ghtlagow.
It t!. r'eat Falls Tribune Mon-i
day evening was published the fol
lowing stor. of the trip of "Our
Boys" triom Glasgow to Helena. XWee
give it in full as follows:
En Mi, "i wi'th C'ompany G, N. G.
M., Gllagow to Helena. Sunday. June

call of the president for service in

compar- flavorably with any body of
ilten ever mobilized in tile grandest
coUntry on earth.
Captain (Dr.) E. N. Layton is in
con~tand, andt J. P. Sternhagen is
first lieutenant. A second lieutenant
is to be selected later. Glasgow con
,tributed a majority of the company.
and Sao i- a c!ose second. Malta has
a large contingent, and Nashua is
well represented.
The hours before the departure of
. the boys from Glasgow were given
,over to a remarkable demonstration
,by the citizens of that town. It was
a spontaneous outpouring of affec
tion, good cheer and Godspeed.
Tears closely followed cheers, and
there were sobs in voices that wished
good luck." The writer last, night
completely realized what Bret' Harte
meant when he spoke of "the great
heart of the nation." The great
heart of the nation was throbbing
with sympatihy and understanding
with the boys at Glasgow last night,
iand one was made to feel that every
person of the thousand that thronged
the station grounds was with the
'soldier boys heart and soul, and that
the good wishes and the hand-clasps
were nor a show. but the sincerest
Imanifestations of love, hope and en
couragemeut from our own dear
friends-the best people on earth.
:The little town of Saco also turned
'out enmasse, although the hour was
about 1:30, to say good-bye to her
boys and all the boys. Malta also had

a crowd out to cheer the company
on its way-at 2:30 in the morning.
This company may never see any
actual warfare; it may get no farth
er than Fort Harrison. In any event,
some will doubtless return home
soon. But whatever its destiny, and
whether fate be kind or cruel, the
hearts of the boys of Company (
will ever glow with warmth at the
remembrance of the moving kindness
of the friends at home.
May God bless 'em, every one.
