Daniel J. Bailey, private sol

court. i
Mr. Jones admitted that at first
thought it semed an outrage for Sir
, Roger to; go" to Germany but he in
Bisted that the defendant had at
tempted merely to organize an Irish
brigade for use against the Ulster vol
unteer- recruited by Sir Edward Car
son. Mr. Jones was proceeding to ar
gne that this did not constitute trea
son when the chief Ju tice interposed.

pmfort to the King's enemies meant
assisting the King's enemies in the
war with this country and that any

tended to weaken the power of this
country to resist the attacks of the

Mr. Jones contended that the work
Sir Rogers did in Germany was pre
cisely the same sort of work he:arried

of the responsibility resting upon it.

LESTER 0. PECK
ILL AT REDDING
COUNTRY HOME
Former State Senator
. Stricken Seriously in
First Sickness.
(Special to The Farmer.)
Redding, June 29. Lester O. Peck,
former state senator, has been serious
ly il at Iiis country home here since
Monday although today it is reported
that his condition shows a slight
change for the better. Iiis physicians,
Dr. oore of Redding and Dr. E. A.
Stratten of Danbury,- have diagnosed
his ailment as acute kidney disease.
Senator Peck is a man of robust phy
sique and has always been very 1 ac
tive. His present affliction is the se
rious illness he has ever had.
Mr. Peck "was formerly a traveling
salesman. When the first subway was
built in New York he subscribed for
some of the first stock and realized
large profits.
In 1902 he came to Redding, buying
the William Crouch farm. He has
since added to his holdings until now
he has about 400 acres He has devel
oped this vast country estate, adding
barns and other, buildings and two
cottages, one of which is occupied by
his superintendent. u
Mr. Peck has been active in Dem
ocratic politics in Fairfield county for
years. He . represented; Redding for
one term in the -house of representa
tives and during the session of 1913
represented the 24th' district in the
Senate. In addition Jto his country
estate, Mr. Peck hasextensive realty
holdings in Bridgeport, including the
Citizens building at Cannon and Main
streets, of which he lis the sole owner.
feenator Peck is 'married but has no
children. He has one'brctfter, D. Carl
ton Peck, a resident of Greenwich.
The . family was for many years en
gaged in the crockery business in the
Citizens' building where the five and
ten cent store is now located.. The
business was handed from the father
to the sons, Arthur Peck, now de
ceased, being the last head of it,- The
family homestead was the stately old
stone house in State street near the
Head of Myrtle avenue, now occupied
by Dr; S. M. Garlick.
Senator Peck is widely - known in
Bridgeport. His two deceased broth
jers, juigene s. ana. Arthur T, were
prominent in Democratic politics The
former was president of the board of
police commissioners, an attorney, and
later became a United States commis
sioner. Arthur T., who died in Den
ver, was Democratic town chairman
for several years, a decade ago. He
served, also, as a fire commissioner.
Another .brother, Ernest M., in bust
ness with his father, died many years
ago.

INSPECTOR OF MILK
HERE ON HALF TIME
Await Reports From State
Investigators on Dairy
Conditions.
Examination of the milk supply of
this city was continued today by
bealth officers. The local authorities
are awaiting specific reports on the
condition of milk and cows examined
at the Beaver Brook farm by the state
authorities.
Though the families of many per
sons prominent in Bridgeport life are
reported as suffering from septic sore
throat, no additional deaths were re
corded today. i
Members of the board of health'to
day are discussing the best means for
future prevention of milk infection.
It is known that the sources of milk
production throughout the country are
so widely distributed that with the
present system of milk inspection it is
impossible to examine each dairy with
the requisite care.
Following the criticism of the health
authorities here - yesterday and tne
disclosures through the state board
of. health, that things claimed to have
been done were not dope and things
done were done inefficiently, there was
a tendency on the part of the local
authorities to claim lack of help.
They said that Dr. A. C. Knapp,
milk inspector, is only on hair time,
and that he gets paia accoramgiy.
They say they need the full time or
one. or more inspectors, ana laDoratory
equipment.
Invitations have been issuea to an

state to join the state health board

BOIL THE MILK
AND THUS AVERT
DISEASE DANGER
Physicians Advocate Simple
Preventative Measure v'
Against Sore,'Throalr.
"Boil the milk!" is the warning that
is going put today to Bridgeport resi
dents. "
Physicians who have studied the
epidemic of septic sore throat in this
vicinity urge boiling milk or pasteur
ization to prevent further incursions
of the infections
. Pasteurization is a. sure preventa
tive measure. Boiling, however, is
simple, effective and more likely to
be welcomed as a daily taslc by tne
average housewife.
Milk . should be boiled during the
next four weeks, or p.asteurized, by
the end of which time the epidemic
.should have released . its hold.
Pasteurization may be accomplish
ed bv inserting a thermometer in the
milk and placing the milk, in a con
tainer, in water. 'The water' should
be brought, to 147 degrees Fahren
heit, and the temperature maintained
for at least 10 minutes. Special ap
Daratus may be purchased for this
method.
Boiling may be done without any
apparatus other than' a cooking ves
sel. Even one minute's boiling is suf
ficient to kill the germs in the milk.'
A diet of boiled milk' for a child
lasting a year or so would be harm
ful. For four weeks, however, it can
do little harm and may save the
child's life.
The septic soar throat epidemic has
already developed a mortality record
equal to that, of typhoid fever. Scien
tific stu,dy of it has been made and
the following, published in the Jour
nal of American Medical Associations,
at Chicago, is illuminating. The
Journal is one of the foremost med
ical papers in the world:
"There is a pronounced resemblance
in the symptoms and clinical course
of the various milk epidemics of sore
throat to which attention has been di
rected of late. This is shown clearly
in the reports of the Christiania, Bos
ton and Chicago outbreaks. In all
three the disease is described as be
ginning suddenly, with or without
chill, followed by fever, muscular
pain, headache, 'sometimes nausea arid
vomiting, prostration, and the usual
local symptoms of a more or less se
vere follicular and membranous ton

Big Business to Follow If 40
Trucks Are Completed
. By Midnight Friday.
HURRY CALL SENT
FOR SKILLED HELP
Government Work Is Done
Separately From That of
Private Business.
Orders for heavy B-lker trucks to
be utilized on the Mexican border have
been received by the Locomobile Co.
from the United States government.
Much larger orders are believed to be
held contingent upon the demonstra
tion of the local factory that they can
furnish cars upon short notice.
Telegrams and messages' by auto
mobile sent about this and other cities
on, Sunday afternoon and late into the
night bought a small army of expert
asseriTblers and automobile men into
Bridgeport early this week.
Today the Locomobile Co. is furi
ously working an additional force of
men upon the completion of fifty five
ton trucks. If these have been fitted
together and tested satisfactorily to
the government inspectors now in this
cfitv. bv mirtnie-ht tomorrow, the Loco-
rmobile officials will be . officially (hand-
ea an oroer ror at least iuu more
trucks to be finished upon like condi
tions with the assurance that much
large orders will be officially signed
upon similar condition.
The specifications for trucks for
government use were sent out several
weeks ago. The Locomobile Co. bid
with restrictions that were tended to
protect the domestic business. As a
result officials of the company were
called to the scene of mobilization
and entered into negotiations which
hinged upon the employment of an
additional force of men to turn out
the government work separately from
the qepartments now assembling
trucks and cars for private deliveries.
Orders were received in this city
Sunday to employ the additional, force
of men and to have 50 trucks com
pleted by midnight Friday. The fac
tory since has been the scene of the
utmost activity, and though the com
plement is now practically completed.
it is said that the work has not been
touched by one individual regularly
employed in the commercial touring
and truck departments.
VICTIM OF HORSE
PlAY FRACTURES
SKULLOF VEXER
Throws Beam at Head of
Workman In Crowd of
His Tormentors.
With one of his tormentors in the
Bridgeport hospital suffering with a
fractured skull and his chances of re
covery very slim, Fabrian Michcofsky
of 4 8 Walter street is in a cell at the
county jail awaiting the outcome of
the injuries of - James George of 617
Walter street.
Both men are laborers at the union
branch of the Bridgeport Brass Co.
and for the last few weeks Michcof
sky has been the butt for the other la
borers who have persisted in torment
ing and teasing him to such an extent
that he has been unable to bear their
jibes .further. The trouble came to a
climax yesterday duripg the noon
lunch hour.
Michcofsky was sitting on a plat
form at the plant eating his lunch and
the other laborers continued torment
ing and picking on him. Finally one
of the men took a bucket of water
and threw it down Michcofsky's back.
Angered at this, Michcofsky jumped
to his feet and saw George standing
several feet away laughing at his
plight.
On the ground was a large piece of
wood and in his rage, Michcofsky
picked it up and hurled it at George,
who apparently ,was delighting at his
discomfiture. George failed to dodge
the beam and it struck him with
much force on the top of the head,
felling him.
George was picked up and imme
diately taken to the Bridgeport hos
pital where it was found that his
skull was badly fractured. Michcof
sky was arrested late yesterday on the
charge of assault but as the condition
of George was regarded as serious,
the case was continued for a week in
the city court today.
The witnesses of the act who are
also said to have been party to the
horse play upon Michcofsky are An

Berichno f 435 Myrtle avenue,

All Traffic Is
Pending the arrival and transfer of prisoners to the Amer

other steps were taken to prevent any disorder.
Shortly before 8 o'clock an escort for the prisoners, consist!
ing of 28 motorcycles manned by a detachment qX the twentieth
infantry and a provost guard, arrived at the American; end ofJ

Those who assembled early were
prepared to wait indefinitely in case

OFFIGBALLV OF
OF ALEylS0A
Washington, June 29 Official, an
nouncement of Carranza's order for
the release of the American troopers
captured at Carrizal reached the state
iiBnaTtmcnt earlv today from Special
Agent Bodgers at Mexico City When
he sent the message last nignt, jstir,
Rodgers expected to be handed a re
ply to the American note at any mo
ment.
Tia n cpr of an immediate break with
the de facto government had been re
lieved last nieht by press despatches
saying the prisoners had been started
for the border from cmnuanua un-y.
Until Carranza replies to the demand
for a statement of his attitude towara-
the American expedition in Mexico to
protect the border, however, me crisis
is only less imminent than it was be
fore. " ,
High officials of the administration
let it be known that the United. States
would proceed with its military opera
tions to adequately safeguard Its citi
zens and territory and would continue
to pursue bandits in Mexico when
ever there was hope or overtaking
them, regardless of any action Mexi
can military commanders may take. -Secretary
Baker carried to the
White House early a .copy of Consul
Garcia's message to Generals Bess at
El Paso stating that the men were
en route to the border last night. Soon
afterward came the despatch from
Mr. Rodgers.
SENATE ACCEPTS
CONFERENCE BILL
CALLING MILITI
Washington, June 29. The Senate
today approved and sent to the White
House the conference report on the
Hay resolution authorizing the Presi
dent to draft into the federal service
all the national guardsmen taking the
prescribed oath.
The House approved the resolution
yesterday after Secretary Baker of the
war department had the imperative
need of immediate action. Before do
ing so, however, the House stripped
the measure of its provisions to ap
propriate $1,000,000 for dependent
families of guardsmen and to exempt
those needed as breadwinners.
The relief proposal will be taken
care of in a separate measure to be
passed by the House next Monday un
der a suspension of the rules. .
Favorable action by the Senate to-
day on the Hay resolution virtually
Suspended

oners' special from Chihuahua C'tt.
to prevent possible demonstrations bjr
the populace.
PTirr to the arrival of the train
there were few soldiers in Juarez, al
though civilian guards were every
where in the city.
CMexican officials expressed pleasure
when told the turn affairs had taken,
asserting that Carranza'a action in re
leasing the American cavalrymen in
dicated he did not want war.
While it wa3 expected the released
Americans" would have little to tell of
the Carrizal fight that had not been
related by other survivors, interest
was shown in the statement it was
hoped could be secured from; Lcra
Spillsbury, the Mormon scout captur
ed during the fight, who is expected
to be with the troops.
WOT
Elizeo Arredondo, the Mexicanj
Ambassador designate, was advised by!
Foreign Minister Agullar in Mexico!
City of his government's action. '
It was apparent about the war and,j
state departments today that release'
of the prisoners had made the situa-!
tion less critical. It had no effect,'
however, on 'efforts to speed up thej
mobilization of the national guard;
along the international line and to!
furnish an adequate supply of wari
material to meet ajiy emergency.
Even should the Mexican reply dis-j
claim any hostile intention and with
draw orders to Carranza military
commanders offensive to the United
States, the border patrol would be
maintained at the strength now con
templated while any danger from
bandits continued.
To free itself from the menace of j
an American army mobilized on itsl
northern frontier, the Mexican gov-j
ernment must comply also with the
demands that it police adequately its
border states and establish such flhw
military control and movement of
bandits into the United States is prac
tically impossible.
While such control is lacking it isi
clearly indicated here that President j
Wilson Is determined by force if
necessary, to employ the army either i
along the line or in Mexico in such a j
way as to insure the safety of Ameri- j
can lives and property along the bor J
der.
