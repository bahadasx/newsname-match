The finest flavored -pineapples
in the world are grown in Florida.
There are three varieties that find
a ready market: the Red Spanish,
Abbaka, sometimes called the
r' . ' sugar loaf," and the Smooth
Cayenne.
Other varieties have been
grown in the past, Queen and
Porto Ricos, but have been dis
carded for the more profitable
kinds.
" The Red Spanish leads in pop-

The Smooth Cayennes of the
West Coast are grown under
slatted sheds costing. about $800
per acre, to protect the fruit from
the hot tropical sun and the possi
bility of a frost. On the East
Coast there are a few sheds left
but owing to the cost of a shed
which lasts only about ten years,
the insurance is too costly and
most of the fruit is now grown in
the open.
On the East Coast the pineap
ples are grown on a high ridge of
sand fronting on the Indian river,
and a few are grown on the flat
woods land lying farther to the

the fancy varieties will do well on
the richer, heavier soils where the
Red Spanish will not do so well.
The characteristic growth on

That the nomination for gov
ernor is to be settled in the courts
of the state, is no longer a ques
tion of doubt.
W. V. Knott, candidate in the
primary of June 6, decided after
a consultation with his friends
frora-all sections of the state to
contest the nomination of Sidney
J. Catts, Mho, upon the tace ot
official returns from fifty of the
fifty-two counties, and two coun
ties unofficial, has a lead of 176
votes.
The general confusion of the
voting, counting and canvassing
of the. second choice votes has
I brought about an element of un
certainty that is so general, that
a question of doubt is felt by a
large percentage of those who
voted in the primary that the face
of the returns are not the correct
expression of those voting. It is
estimated on reliable information
that the second choice votes were
not counted, or were so incorrect
ly tallied, that the county can-
vassing boards could not canvass
these in more than 100 precincts
of the state. These precincts in

Mr. Knott's Statement
Mr. Knott yesterday issued the
following signed statement of his
position :
"To the Democratic Voters of
Florida: The latest data available
from returns sent to Tallahassee
indicate that Mr. Catts will claim
the lead by not exceeding 176
votes.
"Ever since the primary, how
frwr, my friends from all parts of
the state have been collecting evi
dence, which I now have in hand,
of widespread irregularities and
mistakes in counting ballots and
making returns.
"In many-places second choice
votes, the majority of which were
in my favor, were not counted at
all. In other places the inspec

oieo
votes, failed to make intelligent
returns to the canvassing boards.
In other places the election in
spectors, becoming weary with
tedious counting or for other rea
sons, allowed outsiders who were
friends of my opponent to assist
in counting and tallying ballots.
In other places the secrecy ot the
ballot and the integrity "of the
polling place was not preserved.
In places where the vote was
large for my opponent, more
votes were cast or at least re
ported cast than there were vot
ers on the registration list. In
other places persons belonging to

ters connected therewith are now
engaging the attention of the
commissioners and the engineers.
Hon. Wm. 11. Whitten, member
from this district of the board of
commisioners, is investigating the
feasibility of substituting retain

"Besides these, various other
kinds of mistakes and irregulari

or by reason of niisunderstand'ng
the complicated provisions of the
primary law.-Similar information
is reaching me hourly from all
parts of the state.
"If 1 could believe that I have
been fairly and honestly defeated,
I would submit without a word,
but, with the mass of evidence be

that a fair and accurate count
would show that 1 was nominated
by several thousand majority.
Justice to Friend3
"If I did not fight to assert my
rights I would not be doing jus
tice to my thousands of friends
nor to myself.
"Mr. Catts has gono 'into tire
court in Alachua county for the
purpose of trying to secure seventy-four
votes to be counted for
him, alleging that these, seventy

For my part, T am willing and
shall insist that the vote cast in
every precinct in the state where
there is evidence of incorrect re
turns by reason of irregularities,
mistakes or otherwise, shall be
fairly and accurately. recounted.
"No one should be opposed to
an open investigation. Such in
vestigation will not change the re
sult where the election has been
held fairly and the result accu

ocrat desires otherwise. Such an
investigation and recount will
tend to purify the ballot box in
the future.
"I am satisfied that a majority
of the Democratic voters of the
state have cast their vote for me

"In taking this action 1 have
the assurance that I am meeting
the wishes of the largo majority
of Democratic voters in Florida.
"I have directed mandamus

follow before the end of the

"I wish to express my appre

friends throughout the state in

Rascality in Elections
Every man who knows him re
gards Editor Storrs of the De
Funiak Springs Breeze, as a" hon
est fearless writer. Discussing
the Knott-Catts contest, he says:
"There has not been an honest
election held in Florida since the

the carpet baggers. Men have
been elected to high offices in the

and seems probable, the carrying
out of Mr. Whitten 's idea will be
one of the finest things yet sug

And Mr. Whitten will deserve un
divided credit-for it.

"We do not have to go outside
Walton county to find a man giv
en a county commissionership as
a reward for hiding a ballot box
in a swamp to prevent an election
being held. The condition of af
fairs unearthed in Crestview in
1902 is still fresh in the minds of
many, and sworn allegations
made show that conditions were
as bad there this year as then.
Mutilated return sheets to defeat
a candidate for sheriff show the
length to which these things were
carried. In Bay county ballot
boxes and returns were stolen
from the court house.
"Four years ago it was an open
secret that money was used to

How different was it this. year in
reference to other candidates?
"These instances can be multi
plied by the hundred to show
how far reaching is the debauch
cry of the ballot. Neither the
Bryan primary law nor the Tram

sponsible. These things are so be
cause the people generally do not
know of them.
"If this investigation is started
let it go to the bottom of things
without fear or favor. A consid

the state will be benefitted in both
instances. Let the people once
know how these things arc done,
who does them and why they are
done, and for a time at least we
will have honest elections in Flor
ida and the gain would be worth
the cost."
To which is added the following
from the Lakeland Telegram :
It would seem that anv candi
date who apparently, lacks only a
few votes of a nomination would
want to look into things when
such doings took place in con
ducting the election as are report
ed from Okaloosa county. In one
precinct a candidate received on

men have made affidavits that
they voted for him... In another
precinct one of the managers be
came sick andjiarl to leave the
voting place, "and another became
intoxicated and his place was fill
ed by a man who had never been
sworn to serve. If like conditions
prevailed in many Florida coun
ties on election day, the result in
a close race might easily be
changed by a close investigation.

The Star does not think it is
fair to Mr. Knott to insinuate
that he may be the Rutherford B.
Hayes of Florida,, if he wins in
his contest against Catts. We do
not think Mr. Knott has any. of
the Hayes spirit. If he thinks he
has more votes than Catts, it is
his right and his duty to the peo
ple to try to have them counted.
Mr. Knott will make a much bet
ter governor than Catts. Not
withstanding this, if Catts has
one vote more than Knott, he
should have the nomination. And
if Knott has one more than Catts,
the nomination should go to him.
-r-Ocala Star.
This paper said some days ago
that Mr. Knott owed it to himself
and his friends as well as to the
democratic party to take advan
tage of all the rights the law
guarantees him to secure his seat
as governor of Florida. Elimi
nating all thought of self and
friends, he owes that much for
the preservation of the democra
tic party from its threatened dis
ruption and ruin, and we are glad
to learn from the Times-Union of
Thursday that he has brought
legal proceedings to have the
votes retabulated. If a majority
of the first and second choice bal
lots were voted for him, he should
be seated; but, if he lacks even
one of being the choice over his
antagonist, the contention should
immediately end. Mr. Knott
would not have the election nor
would his friends permit him to
have it unless he is fairly and be
yond all doubt entitled to it. If
Catts has won by a single vote,
no true democrat would try to
defraud him of his rights. Ocala

Aside from the expense and
trouble that this will cost Mr.
Catts and his friends, we would
be glad, very glad to see it, and
if this expense could be borne by
the state, it would be worth all it
cost the people in showing them,
if it were carried, as it should be,
to the extent of an opening of
every ballot box in the state and
a re-count of the votes under the
eyes of the courts, just how little
their votes as cast, have, and have
had,- to do with the results of the
elections as proclaimed. If it re
sulted in giving the nomination to
Mr. Knott, by showing that he
was the choice of the people, well
and good, he would be entitled to
it.
Wc do not doubt, however, that
it would show that Mr. Catts has
a far bigger majority than the re
turns show him to have. There

El Paso, Texas Evidence that
the possibility of war with tho
United States has healed the
breach between the Carranza and
Villa factions in Mexican politics
continues to increase here. More
than 100 wealthy Mexicans who
prior to the surrender of the Villa
garrison of Juarez last January,
had been active in supporting the
bandit leader and who since have
been refugees in El Paso, crossed
the Rio Grande and apparently
were received in good favor by
authorities of the do facto govern
ment. Hand bills printed in
Spanish, asserted that Villa him
self had been pledged to support
the Carranza government in the
event of a break with the United
States, were circulated in Juarez
and to some extent in the Mexican
quarter of El Paso.
Reports indicated, however,
that the bandit chieftain has not
yet joined forces but with a body
of his troops is somewhere in the
Rio Florido district of southern
Chihuahua, awaiting develop
ments in the crisis. Gen. Manuel
Medinavietia, formerly Villa's
chief of staff, and Gen. Jose Ysa
bel Robles, minister of war in the
Guitierrez cabinet, were guests
Tuesday of Gen. Francisco Gon
zalez, commandant in Juarez. It
was reported here that they, both
of whom have directed extensive
military campaigns in northern
Chihuahua, are to be assigned to
important commands in General
Trevino's army of the north.
