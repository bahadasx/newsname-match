Notice to Subscribers.
Some times we receive money
in an envelope without even a
scrap of paper telling who sent
it. Other times we receive mon
ey without an address, and we
cannot find their names, or the
name is the same as some other
subscriber at another address,
and we credit wrong party. Then
we get letters signed differently
from the way we have the name
on our list and we are at sea
again. Still others send word to
change their address but do not
tell us where the paper Has Been
Going, and we therefore do not
know how to find them to make
the change. It is a big job to
keep more than 2,000 names in
any editor's memory, so please do
not take it for granted that we
can always remember where to
look for your names they are
indexed by postoflices, not by
names of subscribers.
Attempted Rubbery.
Safe-crackers broke into the
new postoflice at Bedford Friday
night, June 16th. The combina
tion lock on the safe was blown
off, but the robbers were, prob
ablyt frightened away before
they got at the inside compart
ment where the stamps and mon
ey were kept. Bloodhounds from
Cumberland failed to trace the
thieves very far.

OFFICIAL RAILROAD NEH'S.
Boa. John P.- Sipcs, rrcsiilcnt of 31c
Connclhburg end lort L:n:don Kail
road Co., S!a!;cs Slatcmeut.
The construction of the rail
road betweenMcConnells-burg and
Ft Loudon is now assured. The
complete construction contract
was given to Mr. Clyde E. Coon,
of New York, who has beii here
nearly three months. On Thurs
day of last week he sub-let the
entire physical construction to
Messrs. W. F. Patterson and Son.
of Pittsburgh, Pa., who are very
extensive railroad contractors,
having all the neceacary appli
ances to build a railroad. By the
terrm of their contract the Pat
tersons are to begin work on or
before July 10th and have this
entire contract completed on or
before the first day of January
next. The senior Patterson,
who wa9here, declared his inten
tion to push the work as rapidly
as weather conditions will per
mit and will put from 250 to COO
men at work immediately with
steam shovels and teams.
Mr. Coon will have charge of
all work and equipment. He
camo here highly recommended
as a competent builder of rail
roads, electrical or ste am. When
he looked the project over, he
was rleased with it as a stc?.m
proposition and very soon nii.de
known what he wa w illing to do.
This involved the formation of a
steam railroad company and the
time, labor and expense incident
thereto. The McConnellsburg
and Fort Loudon Railroad Com
pany was formed, the stock sub
scribed, the money raised, the
charter obtained after approval
by the Public Service Commis
sion. The road will be operated by
steam. If the time ever comes
when electrifying it shall be
deemed justifiable,!! can be done
on the steam charter.
. Two engines will be provided
at the start, one a 90-ton and the
other 150-ton. These will be of
a special type for heavy grades,
guaranteed to do the work. Pas
senger and freight equipment is
provided for. A combination
freight and passenger station
house will be erected at thi3end;
also a round house and repair
shop, with ample side tracts suf
ficient to accommodate the traf
fic and everything complete with
an improved telephone system
between McConnellsburg and Ft.
Loudon terminals, with block at
the top of the mountain.
At the Ft. Loudon end, con
nection will be made with the
Cumberland Valley railroad en
terms to be made with that com
pany of which the McConnells
burg and Ft Loudon railroad will
be a valuable fi-eder.
The financing of the road has
been completed. It would be a
long story to recount the efforts
made to finance the first compa
ny, which covered a period of
more than a year. For the suc
cess attained for the present
road, credit is due Mr. Coon and
and others here, who gave their
time and effort to it.
An investment banking house
dealing in railroad and municipal
bonds has contracted with the
Railroad Company to take its
whoie bond issue. The Union
Trust Company, one of the larg
est financial institutions of that
kind in New York City, has
agreed to act as trustee. This
fact alone is sufficient guarantee
to informed pereuns thnt the
House that is financing this road is
reputable and stands high among
the financial concerns and inves
tors of the American metropolis.
The contracts for the tics, tele
graph poles,. and material for all
buildings have been let. , Mr.
J. Harvey Cooper of McConnells
burg will furnish the ties and
poles for this end of the road to
the top of the mountain. He
will also furnish all building ma
terial for all building to bo erect
ed. Mr. A. B. Rider, of Ft
Loudon, will furnish the ties and
Great Storm.
, An electrical storm of unusual
severity passed ever this part of
the county Tuesday evening at 5
o'clock. The high wind stripped
the roof off the entire east side
of Frank Mason's large barn at
the edge of town, and otherwise
damaged the building, doors be
ing broken or lifted from their
hinges.
One of the tall trees that stood
in front of J. K. Johnston's store
was blown down and blocked
traffic for npnrly an hour. Half
a pear trc a Inrge locunt tree,
and a window about covered the
damage at Andy Washabaugh'a.
The window was carried the
'englh of the room. A v a'nut
tree on Mason's Lane, a big tree
noar the Lutheran church, two
trees near Dan Grisshger's and
many broken branches in other
parts of the town were reported.
Telephone service out of town
is bad at best, but next morning
we were unable to call up distant
points to learn all particulars.
Two cattle were reported killed
by lightning on the William Pat
terson farm now owned by Da
vid A. Nelson. Five cattle be
longing to Rr.bert Cutchall at
tempted to swim the creek on the
Thos. F. Sloan farm and one of
them was drowned. Corn fields
wore badly washed and wheat
laid low.
At Fort Loudon, an auto party
took shelter at the hotel. They
had scracely gained the house
when a tree fell across their ma
chine. Mail drivers reported
several trees across the telegraph
wires on the west side of Cove
Mountain.
bince the foregoing was put in
type, we learned that the cattle
killed belonged to Baltzer Cut
chall. Also that the Robert Cut
chall cow was found two or three
fields distant down stream, "an
chored'" to a sma'l island, little
the worse of her involuntary imi
tation of a German sub-marine
stunt.
Narrow Escape.
C. B. Weller, manufacturer of
flour and feed in Big Cove, was
one of many who assisted David
A. Nelson to raise his new barn
last Thursday. While Mr. Wel
ler was in a stooping position on
the barn floor, a heavy hammer
fell from a joist fourteen feet
above him, striking him a glanc
ing blow on his back cutting his
suspenders. The handle of the
sledge hit him on the back of hi3
head and raised a big lump. Wel
ler thinks the hammer weighed
100 pounds, but the men who did
not get hit say it weighed ten
pounds. It was a narrow escape
from more serious consequences,
for a ten-pound hammer, falling
fourteen feet, has sufficient force
to crush a man's skull.
Excuse Us, Please.
Last week, last month, last
year we purposely said nothing
about unpleasant occurrences in
our little city, for the reason
that outsiders would have, inter
preted it as secere reflection up
on the leading citizens whose du
ty it is to see to it that these
things do not happen. Our town
has no more not as many row
dies as other towns of similar
size. But we are making the
mistake of expecting our rowdies
to govern themselves preposter
ous idea. This much we have
said in deference to the feeling
of our good friends who, perhaps
think we are indifferent to bad
behavior.
telephone poles from the Ft.
Loudon end to the top of the
mountain. The contracts for
rails, passenger and freight
equipment have all been made,
including the engines before
mentioned. The road will be
thoroughly and completely bal
lasted with crushed rock. The
road is to be standard gauge, up
to date, complete, and will be a
credit to the County. Theched
ule of rates, passenger, and
freight, will be submitted to and
approved by the Public Service
Commission.

UNCOOKED FOODS.
Little Talks on Health and fygiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, 31. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
During the hot weather fruits
and vegetables are a necessary
part of the diet. Many of these
are more appetizing when eaten
raw. Berries, radishes, onions
and salads appear regularly on
the menu at this season and have
their value as food.
Care should bo exercised in
the preparation serving of green
foods however, as they are sub
ject to much handling between
the garden and the table. Un
less the hands through which
they pass are absolutely clean
they are more or less contaminat
ed. In many market gardens
the gathering of the produce is
intrusted to a class of labor which
is not any too cleanly and care is
3eldom exercised to insure clean
liness. Food exposed for sale in mar
kets is also often subject to indis
criminate handling by prospec
tive purchasers and is seldom
properly protected from dust and
dirt.
As a protection berries and
foodstuffs eaten raw should be
thoroughly washed before being
served. It is far better to risk a
slight impairment of the flavor
than to chance eating unclean
foods.
Nightsoil should not be used
for fertilizing gardens from
which the produce may be eaten
raw. Water-cress should not be
gathered from streams which are
polluted by sewage. Many cases
are on record where typhoid fe
ver has resulted from failure to
observe this precaution.
Children's Cay in Town.
Children's service were held in
the M. E. church and in the Pres
byterian church in town last
Sunday evening. The floral dec
orations in both churches were
profuse and beautiful. The boys
and girls recited their parts well.
When it comes to training ba
bies from two years old and up
wards, to speak in public, much
patience is required, and if, when
the final test comes, humorous
mistakes occur, it only adds to
the interest of the occasion.
Credit is due to Mrs. C. B. Stev
ens who led the music for the
Methodist children, and to Miss
Cornetha B. Nesbit for the Pres
byterians. Miss Anna Dickson
assisted at the organ in the Pres
byterian church. Both churches
were crowded jto accommodate
the audiences.
Marriage Announced.
The News recently received
cards from Mrs. George Geinger,
of Buck Valley, announcing the
marriage of her daughter Miss
Jessie to Mr. Frank Meulendyke,
Friday, June 23rd. Mr. and Mrs
Meulendyke will be at'home to
friends at 68 Grandview Ave.,
Plainfield, N. J., after August
first.
A note from Jessie states that
she is at present in charge of the
Gary System work in Bound
Brook. N. J. Mr. Meulendyke
is connected with the Legal De
partment of the New York Cen
tral Railroad, in New Rork City.
The News extends hearty con
gratulations and best wishes.
Aid Society Honored.
Saturday, June 17th, the Hus-
tontown Aid Society of the M. E.
church entertained th e Green
Hill Society at the home of Mrs.
Sarah Evans, at Hustontown.
Mrs. Evans was assisted by Mrs.
George Deshong. There were
present at the entertainment 45
ladies and 10 children. The
Green Hill ladies speak in high
est praise of their reception at
Hustontown.
Arm Broken.
Mrs. Ernest Cooper, of Ayr
township, fell from a load of hay
last Friday and broke her left
arm near the wrist Dr. Mos
se reduced the fracture.
Big Clover.
Editor. -Mr. J. A. Stewart
failed to tell U3 what kind of
land his big clover grew on, and
what he did to make it big two
important points for farmers.
His was big but 1 can beat it a
little. Mine is 3-fcet 8-inches.
Two years ago I had an old
field of three acres that was
thought to be worn-out and had
a little of everything on it but
what was wanted. I plowed it
and sowed it in buckwheat, us
ing 200 pounds 12-5 fertilizer to
the acre, but the season being
dry, I got no returns. I then
put on 50 bushels of slacked lime
to the acre and 150 pounds of
the same kind of fertilizer and
sowed to rye and got 16 bushels
to the acre. I also sowed clover
and got the foregoing big stalks.
I am now ploughing it under.
As there are hundreds of simi
lar acres in Fulton county, let us
figure it up to see what small ex
pense is necessary to build them
up to produce good crops. Cost
of foregoing treatment per acre
as follows:
50 bu. slacked lime, $3.00
Buckwheat fertilizer $2.86
Rye fertilizer $2.15
$8.01
Now, Brother Farmer, some
day when you start for a load 'of
cheap fertilizer that will brihg
you only a few extra bushels of
wheat, change your mind and go
to the limekiln, get a load of
stone lime, take it home and let
it slack under cover and then fol
low some plan to restore humus
as Nature intended. I. W. Zim
merman, Bethel township.
To Place Sheep on Shares.
Five hundred or more Pennsyl
vania farmers are to be started
in the sheep raising business
through a movement which has
been brought about by bankers
and manufacturers of the State
acting in conjunction with Sec
retary of Agriculture Charles E.
Patton.
It is proposed to place with
each farmer ten thrifty ewes and
to give him for the proper feeding
watering and care, all the wool
and one-half of the lambs pro
duced by the sheep.
The idea is to have a number
of farmers in a community go
into the scheme so that a carload
of sheep can be shipped to a cen
tral point and the community can
be supplied from that station.
This will serve to keep the costs
as low as possible.
The movement is expected to
stimulate the sheep industry in
Pennsylvania and to demonstrate
to the farmers that the sheep
business is profitable. Not since
the Civil War has the price of
wool or of mutton and lambs been
as high as at the present time.

. Tut to the Test.
In these days of hot-headed
politics it came with good grace
when the Philadelphia Press
said editorially a few days ago
"Let those who have been loud
ly crying for intervention in Mex
ico now shoulder their guns and
go." N '. '
Last Monday, Billy Nace hired
a big auto and took his father
and his cousin Wilson, and friend
W. H. Greathead to see the Buf
