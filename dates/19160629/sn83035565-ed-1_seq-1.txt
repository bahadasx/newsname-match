The annular eclipse of the sun
on July 29 is visible only in the
South Pacific and Indian Oceans,
the central line passing through
Australia. The apparent diame
ters of the sun and moon are so
nearly the same that the varying j
distances of the moonfrom the
earth causes at times the, moon's
apparent diameter to be less than
that of the sun, so that when, as
at the time of an eclipse, the two
bodies are seen directly in line
the sun will appear the larger of
lhe tw0j henc wilI fail to
entirely cover up the sun and the
moon will appear as a black body
surrounded by a brilliant ring or
annulus of light. Such eclipses
are called annular;. Ohio State
