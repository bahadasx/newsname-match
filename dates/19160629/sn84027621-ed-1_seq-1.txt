El Pao, June 28, 6 p.. m. General
Trevino has ordered the release of the
Americans taken prisoners at Car
rizal, according to word received at
Juarez tonight. They will be brought
to Juarez. '
AMERICAN TROOPERS EXPECT
ED AT JUAREZ TODAY
Washington, June 29. Ambassador
Designate Arredondo received a mes
sage this morning from Foreign Min
ister Aguilar confirming -the report
that General Carranza had ordered
General Trevino to release the Amer
ican troopers captured at Carrizal.
General Funston advised the war de
partment this morning of a dispatch
from General Bell last night, saying
Consul Garcia informed - him at El
Paso of the ordered to release the
prisoners. No confirmation has been
received from other than Mexican
sources. The dispatch' merely said
the soldiers were ordered freed, and
were en route from Chihuahua to
Juarez. They are expected to arrive
today. , - '
OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT
Official announcement of General
Carranza's order to release the Amer
ican troopers captured at Carrizal
reached the state department this
morning from Special Agent Rodgers
at Mexico City. ,
EXPECTING CARRANZA'S AN
SWER When he sent the message, Mr.
Rodgers said he expected a reply to
the American note at any moment.
IMMEDIATE BREAK AVERTED
Danger of an immediate break was
relieved by press dispatches saying
the prisoners had been started for the
' Lorder from Chihuahua.
CRISIS CONTINUES
Until Carranza replies to the de
mand for a statement of hi3 attitude
toward the American expedition in
Mexico and to protect the border the
crisis is not ended.
NO CHANGE IN POLICY
High officials of the administration
let it be known that the United States
would proceed with military opera
tions to adequately safeguard Ameri
can citizens and territory. United
States soldiers will continue to pursue
bandits into Mexico whenever there is
hope of overtaking them, regardless
of action on the part of Mexican mili
tary commanders.
MOBILIZATION CONTINUED
The lessening of the tension had no
effect on the efforts to speed the mob
ilization of national guardsmen along
the border and to furnish an adequate
supply of war materials to meet any
emergency. Even should the Mexican
reply meet all demands, the border
patrol will be maintained at the
strength now contemplated while the
bandit danger continues.

National Guard of Florida is Most In
adequately Supplied by
the Nation
(Jacksonville Metropolis, 28th).
,,Gen. J.' Clifford R. Foster this aft
ernoon, stated that , telegrams from
Washington advise that equipment for
the Second Regiment has been ship
ped, and that as soon as it arrives
those men who have had military
training, likely, .will be dispatched to
a mobilization point on the border.
General Foster declared that the
members of the regiment who are un
trained will be held, here until ' they
are able to reach the classification of
semi-trained soldiers, and that Z as
quickly as possible after that time
they will be called into service. Thirty
days, it is believed, should suffice for
such training, which will be admin
istered ia nn intensive manner.
Minus uniforms, rifles and other
equipment, a large portion of the men
encamped at Black Point are wholly
unprepared to go into service. The
rookies present a sight bordering on
the pathetic. Those above the peace
strength of the twelve companies in
camp are without military equip
ment. .They are drilled in civilian's
clothes and are without rifles. With
1,400 men encamped, with equipment
for only a small portion of them
about a hundred recruits are being re
ceived daily. ' ; ; - ' ; .
The fault, however, does not lie
with the ; commanding officers, .the
men, nor with the state. With the
proper equipment on hand work can
go on rapidly and the untrained men
are expected to round rapidly into
shape for military duties once they
are supplied with rifles and necessary
accouterments. - t
Several days, at least, are expected
now to elapse before moving orders
come for the regiment. : Such orders
are not expected until equipment ar
rives, and that is an unknown equa
tion which the officers have to deal
with.
In the meantime the men are work
ing conscientiously trying to break
themselves into the military erind
with what little equipment they have,
in hope of soon being ordered into
active service.

THE HOME GUAFID
A Good Turn-Out and Promise of Ef
cient Aid in Time of Need
The home guards gathered at the
armory last night, 38 out of the .153,
and organized for the purpose-of de
fendinf the city in any emergency.
Captain John M. Graham presided. It
was decided that the guard would re
main intact until a military company
can be formed and mustered into the
national guard of the state. A new
military company can not be formed
until the Rifles, now at Black Point,
are mustered into the federal service.
; The home guard will meet once a
month, the second Wednesday. In' the
meantime, if any of the young men of
the city wish to do some drilling and
learn the fundamentals of tactics,
Captain Harris of the W. O. W.
company, will be glad to have them
drill with his men. Capt. Harris was
last night elected second lieutenant of
the home : guard. The non-commissioned
.officers will be appointed by
Captain Graham.
In the everit of an emergency call
ing for the services of the home guard
the fire bell will be tapped 20 times,
and repeated. The members of the
guard will mobilize at the armory,
bringing with them whatever arms
and ammunition they possess. Those
who do not have guns and ammuni
tion can borrow some if necessary.
Dr. Van Hood last night offered the
use of several guns, and Mr. D. E. Mc
Iver told Captain Qraham that .here
were-about 40 guns with ammunition
at Mclver & MacKay!s that could be
obtained in case of necessity. Mr. Mc
lver thought that the other hardware
dealers would make the same offer.
Captain Harris marched his Wood
men company to the armory in their
uniforms, and put his men through a
drill that was a splendid example for
the members of the guard. The Wood
men were inspected by Captain Gra
ham, who pronounced their work very
good. '
i Captain Graham today appointed
the following non-commissioned offi
cers: Chas. J. Leitner, 1st sergeant; R.

PLANS FOR THE PARK
Completed by the Landscape Archi
tect and Pronounced to be
Very Good
Harold B. Swope, landscape archi
tect, has completed the plans for the
proposed municipal park on the Tay
lor pond property, and copies of the
design a very, beautiful one have
been received by the Woman's Club
committee. Mr. Swope points out
that the plan "is necessarily sugges
tive, rather than exact in some of its
details, due to the lack of accurate
data." "He believes that the design is
thoroughly practical and economical,
and says: "It is to be remembered
that the development of a , park, un
Lke the construction of a building, is
an operation that can go on for years
after the first outlines are established.
In the meantime, if the first steps are
wise ones, the park will be of constant
and unfailing pleasure to its users,
and the slow development of new
beauties will be a constant source of
gratification." :
Accompanying the design; is a 14-
page typewritten manuscript of ex
planation. At the outset Mr. Swope
says that the plan has been prepared
with a. view to "providing the great
est possible number of attractive park
features for both children and adults,
through the utilization of existing
conditions rather than by resorting to
costly experiments of grading and
the alteration of the natural contours.
At the same time, the present require
ments df the city in regard to the use
of the property and the necessity of
assuring a low maintenance cost
have been constantly kept in mind."
The general treatment is natural
istic. The outstanding features of
the design are: a mall, playgrounds, a
lake, an island, a wood, a grove, a
grotto, a wild garden, and winding
walks. Mr. Swope has made his de
sign in color, and an excellent idea is
readily obtained of the whole scheme.
The mall, a broad straight walk.
prolongs the axis of Watuia street
acress the park, to May street, and
separates the playgrounds from the
remainder of . the park. Trees on
either side of the walk are provided
for, and the eventual "result js a
broad, cool, densely shaded tunnel of
foliage." The playground will be
provided with facilities for games and
athletic sports, with a smaller play
ground for little children. A six-foot,
running track, about one sixth of a
mile in circumference, with a 1Q0
yard straightaway, is provided. Five
tennis courts are planned. A wading
pool, sand-box and swings are provid
ed for the little children.
The lake is really two bodies of J
water connected .by a small passage,
which is spanned by a bridge, the
whole affording an opportunity for
boating and bathing. The island, oc
cupying the ground now covered by a
neavy growth of willows, will be
thickly wooded, with a variety of -undergrowth,
giving, in connection with
the lake, a variety of. landscape pic
tures. Very little change is recommended
for the grotto by Mr. Swope. The
naturally romantic aspect. , of the
place is to be undisturbed. Whatever
planting is done here will be simply
an accentuation of the naturally wild
growth. In the wild garden the con
ditions will be essentially the same

PfiEPAHATIOHS FOR THE IHEVITABLE CONFLICT AHE GOHIG FOR-
WARD UNDER HIGH PRESSURE
(Associated
San Antonio, June 29. Army offi
cers at Gen. Funston's headquarters
continued their work today of shap
ing the increasing army for a possi
ble offensive. The notification that
Carranza has ordered the release of
the American prisoners didn't lower
the high pressure under which those
in command have been working the
past ten days. The opinion is wide
spread that the Release of the colored
troopers hasn't altered the basis rea
sons for the mobilization of a great
army on the border. The danger of an
open break with Carranza troops is
not greatly lessened, officers believe.

Knott is Determined to Have the
Votes Accurately Counted
(Jacksonville Metropolis, 28th)
of, the vote in certain
precincts in at least 27 counties of the
state will be asked for before the
proceedings which are now being in
stituted by counsel in behalf of W. V.
Knott, contender for the gubernator
ial nomination which was awarded to
Sidney J. Catts, Monday afternoon by
the state canvassing board, shall have
all been filed. So announced Attorney
T. B. Adams, of the Knott counsel,
this morning.' ,
Recounts in Hamilton, Madison and
Suwanee counties and in two precincts
in Leon county have already been au
thorized and the Knott headquarters
express the belief that if the ques
tioned precincts in these , counties
alone are recounted he. will have
enough votes to overcome the 260 vote
lead accredited to Mr. Catts by the
state board. However, it is not the
intention of the counsel for Mr. Knott
to stop there, but a fight for every
single vote in the state will be made,
where it is believed that irregulari
ties of any kind exist.
The worst irregularities are alleged
in Polk, Holmes and Hillsborough
counties, where it is alleged thvat sev
eral hundred non-democratic voters
evidently cast a vote. It is cited that
the registration books in these coun
ties show certain numbers of 'demo
cratic voters in each precinct and that
the total vote in a number of in
stances was far' in excess of the num
ber which should have been authoriz
ed to vote under the law. It is alleg
ed that a large number of socialists
and republicans took part in the elec
tion in these counties.
"Mr. Knott only wants the votes
which were east for him in the pri
mary election. - These he proposed to
see are properly accredited to him,
and he believes that when these votes
are given him, as entitled, he will eas
ily be the nominee of the party by
several hundred votes to spare," said
Mr. Adams.
as in the grotto, and so for the other
quarry areas. It is-recommended that
the city use the quarries, if needed,
judiciously, to avoid the destruction
of any interesting features.
A field house is recommended. "It
should , have a broad piazza, to serve
as a grand stand for viewing the
athletic contests, should contain dressing-rooms
and lockers for athletes
and bathers, and the necessary of
fices. A room may be provided for a
refreshment concession, also, it is sug
gested. Other features provided for
are a shelter, comfort station, rustic
bridges, drinking fountains. A list of
the various trees and shrubs proposed
for the park is given. Palms are ad
vised against as being strikingly out
of keeping with the great mass of
native vegetation. The introduction
of palms, "unless most skillfully
handled, is almost certain to cause a
lack of harmony." If used, accord

ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE
THE 1903 ORDINANCE
Mr. Neil Harris, freight agent for
the Seaboard Air Line, was yesterday
afternoon arrested on a " charge of
having failed to erect gates at the
North Magnolia street crossing of his
road. This is the procedure adopted
by the city in enforcing against the

cently decided to enforce this ordi
nance in order that the efficacy of the
gate might be ascertained.
Mr. Harris was brought before the
recorder this morning. The hearing
of the case,, however, was postoned
until July 10.
Mr. Harris said that the Seaboard
intended to put in the gates and the
hearing was put off for this reason.
