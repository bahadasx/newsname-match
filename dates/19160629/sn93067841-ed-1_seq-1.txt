State Superintendent of Educatior
ohn E Swearingen has sent the folswing
letter to the county Superin
endents of Education:
Dear Sir:?The Democratic en
ollment now in progress in everj
ounty affords school officers and
eachers a practical test of our edu
ational efficiency.
Every white man above twenty
ne years of age is entitled to enrol
a his local club,and should be urged
o do so. As far as practical, every
oter should write his own signature,
Ithough it will be necessary for unreined
and unlettered men to sigc
rith a cross.
On the Democratic club rolls of
914 nearly 22% of the reported en
ollment was marked with this cross.

1 and universal enrollment in 1916
vill show a material reduction in this
erceutage of illiterates? I hope loal
club officers everywhere will join
lands with school workers in an efort
to reduce this number.
After the enrollment for each
ounty has been finished, I shall ask
he county Democratic chairman for
he data so kindly furnished from s
uajority of the counties in 1914.
'he enclosed sheet shows the nature
f these data, which I trust may be
romptly collected and forwarded
rom every count}. The co-operation
f the county chairman and the
ounty superintendent in securing
hese facts will be of material serv?
to the schools, and will be highly
ppreciated by the State Superinendent.
Respectfully,

A VALUABLE INVENTION?COT
I TON BLOOMS-LOCAL AND
1 PERSONAL NOTES.
Lake City, June 27:?Section Mas
ter Parrott, who has charge of th<
> track of this division, has patente<
a rail joint fastener for railroads
that may prove the most meritori
oils thing of its kind brought for
ward in many years. The Paten
News, which is the leading journa
of the country in matters of thi
kind, in a letter to Mr Parrott i
few days ago, asking for a photo
graph of the fastener for publication
stated that it appeared to be th<
best thing of its kind patented ii
many years. Mr Parrott has als<
received offers to buy the paten
rights for the United States am
Canada. Many railroad men sa;
that the vast majority of accident
due to derailment of engine or trail
are caused by defective joints. M
Parrott's fastener is intended t
remedy this effectively. By thi
fastener the rails are held togethe
firmly without fish plates or bolts
and at the same time the expansioi
and contraction of the rails due t
heat and cold are taken care of in
1 manner which keeps the joint rigi
and the rails plumb.

The annual picnic of the Confederate

TO WAIVE CLAIM
AGAINST STATE.
;
I
GENERAL ASSEMBLY VOTES TO
, DROP SOUTH CAROLINA
MATTER.
j Washington,June 26:?The House
I today, in considering the military
appropriation bill, agreed to waive
the claim of the United States Govf
ernment against the State of South
Carolina for military property lost
and damaged some years ago. This
claim originally amounted to something
like $104,000, but was subsequently
reduced, through the efforts
of Adjutant General W W
Moore, Gov Manning and others, to
about $30,000.
This matter has given much trouble
to the State authorities of South
Carolina for a long time and recently
both Gov Manning and Gen Moore
came to Washington and saw the
war department officials regarding
the matter. At that time they were
assured that it would soon be satisfactorily
arranged. Today's action
of the House in waiving this claim
substantially wipes out this old obligation
and places the militia forces
of the State on a clean basis again
with no property loss shortage standing
against them.
Big Celebration on the Fourth.
Olanta, June 28:?At a recent
meeting of citizens it was decided to
have a big rally and picnic here at
the old soldiers' park July i in the
interest of Olanta and community.
Some of the speakers secured by the
committee who have the rally in
charge are: Messrs P B Ingraham of
Johnsonville,Thomas Brantley of Orj
angeburg and Hon John L McLaurin .
, {of Bennettsville. All the people of !
the town and surrounding communJ
ity are expected to come and bring
i baskets. That there will be plenty
of barbecue is understood by those
. who have ever attended picnics in
, this section. This will not take the
! place of the old soldiers' picnic which
! is held here each year the fourth Saturday
in July.
