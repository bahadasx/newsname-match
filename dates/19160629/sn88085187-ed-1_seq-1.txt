!i/.e war with Mexico would
simply mean taking up the
white Iran's litinlen.
"hive years and ."iOO.IIOO
men—those figures sum up
the nature of the job."
"The war will be one of ma
uvers, not of munitions," the
'ielal explained. "We won't use
avy artillery, in the first
ice we haven't any. In the see
d place we couldn't transport it
er the Mexican sands and
iiiinains. In the third place we
mid have no use for it.
"Very few of the lessons of the
ir in Europe will help us. There
II be practically no trench war
re, so there will be no occasion
r use of asphyxiating gas, peri
jpes nor steel helmets.
Nor do I look for much use of
i? aeroplane. There will be few
tterles and no large bodies of
eitiy troops to be located. As
r bomb dropping, that is only
'ectlve against highly organized
lltary columns, railroad sta
tions or concentration camps. The
jseroplane will be used chiefly to
terry messages.
"The whole strategy of
the campaign in a nutshell is
this: Advance a few miles,
capture a village, disarm
the inhabitants and take over
its administration; police it,
t clean it up, dig sewers, per
fect the sanitation, then
move to the next village.
"The cavalry probably would
play a less and less important
part In fighting. It has already
proved a disappointment. Not
that It isn't of the highest gal
lantry, but because there is no
Torage for the horses, which
therefore became a great burden
on Ihe transport system, already
Buffering tremendous difficulties
because of the Impassable nature
Of the country.
"Our soldiers will pass an
innocent looking peon hoeing
a patch of corn. When they
are out of sight he will
scamper off, round up a
j. neighboring command of ir
regular* who will swoop
down on our men from the
rear, fight a bloody skirmish,
then take to their heels over
the hills.
"What can our men do against
these unarmed peons? Gradually
unearth the hidden rifles, arrest
•the suspicious characters and so,
month by month, slowly push a
ban of sanitation and order over
northern Mexico.
"While the successive groups
of villages and bandit groups are
ibeing surrounded, subdued and
disarmed It will be the duty of
the nsvy to blockade the. coast
and prevent uew supplies of arms
-teaching the Mexicans.
"At Vera Crux, Mexico City and
" similar towns considerable forces
of armed regulars may be bottled
iup and here there win be some
thing like trench warfare, but the
United States will observe the
Hague convention and will not
bombard these cities unless it is
necessary to dislodge snipera and
machine gun squads."

WAI'KBGAN, 111., June It. —
Will 11. Orpet, when he entered
the court room today, showed
signs of the ordeal 3e wnt
through yesterday under ielent
less cross-examination by Prose
cutor .loslyn.
The natural palor of iiis fare
had tleepened, and mast of «ho
confident manner lie bad when lie
began his story of the death of
Marian Lambert, his scliool girl
sweetheart, had left him.
in an attempt to break town i
Orpet's original story that Muria.i
had committed suicide, the youttg
student was led slowly 3ut surely
into a trap set for him oy the
prosecutor.
Tells of Trip.
Orpet had prevlotihly tt'stifiod
that when he turned bach __
Helm's woods and saw Marian in
her dying throes in the -mow, he
knelt down uy tier and called to
her.
Her right hand, he had said,
was bare and partly closed, lie
opened It a little and noticed the
powder in the line of her hand.
In the cross-examination the
prosecutor led Orpet on with en
couraging and sympathetic .voris,
to tell of his trip from -Madison,
where he was attending the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, to Lake For
est, into the woods with Marian
and to the death scene.
Says It Was (.loved.
At the close of the story the
prosecutor began firing questions
In quick succession concerning the
poslton and appearance of the
girl's body at the time of her
death. In the midst of these
questions his manner changed,
and he asked suddenly:
"And was her hand bare or
gloved?"
Orpet, pallid and worn with
hours of close Juestiomug, hesi
tated.
"1 don't Just remember—l
think It was hare. No, 1 remem
ber, it was gloved."
The prosecutor Immediately
changed the subject and was pro
ceeding to ask another question
when Orpet recovered .limself.

CASEMENT
GUILTY OF
TREASON
I-OMM.X, June 21).—Sir
Koger Casement this after
noon was convicted of high
treason ami sentenced t«i
death in connection with Ihe
Irish i<-in II and attempts
to induce Irish prisoners in
i.ciinpiii. to desert.
The jury deliberated less than
an hour.
Hefore the case went to the
jury Haron Heading dealt Case
ment's hopes .1 body blow.
K. 10. Jones, counsel for the de
fense, had argued that Sir Koger
bad been a loyal, patriotic Irish
man, recruiting a regiment uniting
the Herman prisoners because Ul
ster threatened civil war in Ire
land.
The lord chief justice Inter
posed.
"The jury will bo instructed
that any art tending to weaken
the country's power Of resistance
was aiding and comforting the
king's enemies," he ruled.
The ruling plainly depressed
Casement. Heading later In
structed the jury that even If only
one of the six alleged acts was
proved, the defendant would be
Hillty.
The death sentence was pro
nounced after Casement, in a
vo'ce that was scarcely audible,
had addressed Ihe court briefly.
Casement later recovered his
voice and made an impassioned
speech while standing in the pris
oner's dock.
"In Kiiglauil alone in the
—tnh century, loyalty to one's
country is held as ti ciline.
If it is treason to fight un
der such circiinistances, I'm
proud to be a rebel," he said,
gesturing dramatically.
He regained his ••oniposure
completely, and stood erect and
smiling when reading the pro
nounced sentence.
Daniel Bailey's case was then
called. Baron Reading i-nmeli
ately instructed the jui*y to ac
quit him.

$490,000 Penmanship
Job--Just Like That
By Mabel Abbott
Mrs. Ida McQuesten, president
of the school board, sat at the
head of the long oak table in the
board room. It was only a little
after | o'clock yesterday after
noon, and the board meeting
would not begin until 4, but Mrs.
McQuesten was very busy.
Two piles of pale-green papers
lay before her. She took a paper
from one pile, wrote something at
the bottom of the sheet and laid
It on the other pile.
Then Bhe took another and did
the same thing—and another and
another, with a smooth, auto
matic motion, as If she had been
doing it for a long time.
The pale-green papers were
thousand-dollar school bonds—
490 of them. They are to be used
in refunding $490,000 of the Ta
coma school bond issue. Mrs.
McQuesten, as president of the
hoard, was signing them. She
has to sign the whole 490.
"Yes, I get tired signing ray
name sometimes," she admitted,
without interrupting the steady
motion of her hand.
"These bonds, however, are a
small job, compared with the
monthly warrants for salaries.
One month I signed 600 and 700
warrants at one sitting. A week

to the warrants, I signed 111 di

She signed steadily until the
iMiard <onvened, and then she
went on signing, though more
slowly, while Secretary Alfred
Lister read the minutes, and
while the board threshed out with
the contraitors, Olson & Young,
some small disputed bills hang
ing over from the construction of
the Lincoln Park High school, and
referred several questions con
cerning the Stadium to the Sta
dium committee of the Commer
cial dull, and attended to other
vacation routine matters. The
womin president really presided
—she was no figurehead ■- but
like most women, she can do two
things at once, and whenever
there was a moment's pause she
got a few more bonds signed.
But when the hands of the
clock pointed to six. the first
pile of green papers had not yet
all been transferred to the sec
cad pile. Mrs. McQuesten look
ed at them consideringly.
"It Is necessary to have these
bonds finished today, Mr. Lis
ter?" she asked. The secretary
abook his bead.
"Then I'm going to leave
them until tomorrow," she an
nounced. "We stand adjourned."
