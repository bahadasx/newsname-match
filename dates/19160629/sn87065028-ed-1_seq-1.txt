Health of Soldiers Good, and
All Are Eagerly Awaiting

Together with other commands
forming component units of the
Mississippi National Guard, the Co
lumbus Riflemen and the Caledonia
delegation which left with them over
the Southern Railway in Mississippi
last Saturday night, are now biv
ouaked at Camp, Swep . Taylor in
Jackson, and are said to be eagerly
awaiting orders to move forward to
the Mexican border. Jackson papers
state that all of the boys are in good
health and are in every way ready
to undertake the hard campaign
which lies before them.
That local interest in the Mexican
fight is very keen is evinced by the
fact that twenty-four young , men
have expressed a desire to join the
volunteer company which Capt. T.
H. Sharp and Mr. J. G. Weatherly
have announced their intentions of
c . gamze here. No attempt to se
cure recruits has been , made, those
who have signified their willingness
to join the command having done so
voluntarily, and Capt. Sharp and Mr.
Weatherly believe they will have no
trouble In organising a company of
150 men. ,
The following have signified their
intention of joining the company:
Messrs. Leo Flynn, Dr. J. W. Cox,
John Oliver, Jr., Frank Betts, S. M.

attendance will be larger than at the
Tupelo series, most of these games
having been witnessed by small
crowds.

American nero troopers faced al- of New Orleans, which concern, af

smiles on their lips and they burst
into songs once or twice as they
fought with grim odds against them.
This was the story - told by Capt.

Field Headquarters. "For forty-five
minutes the men fought, joking
among themselves all the while even
though they realized we had been
trapped and little chance of getting
out alive," he said.

Public opinion in Spain is greatly
mpressed by the Mexican situation,
says the Temps' Madrid correspond
ent. Despite the talk of intervention
by King Alfonso in favor of peace
between the United States and Mex
ico, no official move in this respect
has been made. The feeling in Spain
is that it is of the greatest impor
tance and urgency that peace and
order in Mexico be re-established. It
is pointed out that there are 300,000
Spaniards in Mexico who would be
unable to carry on business and
many would be virtually ruined un
less this country should intervene.

ATTORNEYS FOR PURCHASERS
ARE SATISFIED AND ADVISE
COMPLETION OF DEAL.
All doubt concerning the legality
of the issuance of bonds in the su a
of $50,000 for the erection of a
bonds, hesitated at concluding nego
tiations because they feared the law
had not been fully complied with.
Fear that the bonds were not legal
was occasioned by the fact that they
were issued by the Columbus Separ
ate School District, and not by the
city of Columbus as a municipality.
Messrs. Dillon, Thompson and Clay,
attorneys residing in New York, to
whom the matter was referred, could
not at first understand why the
bonds were issued by the school dis
trict instead of the municipality, but
an examination of local laws thor -
oughly satisfied them as to their le
gality and they have advised the In
terstate Hank and Trust Company to
complete the purchase.
There still remain a few formali
ties to go through with, but it is be
lieved that negotiations will be com
pleted and the money available for
use within a very short time.

yesterday by a unanimous vote after
its- total had been increased to
000,000 through the addition of
$26,000,000 for many separate
items, the appropriation hill now

Discussion of the amendments re
flected the threat of the Mexican
situation. Members demanded that
there be haste in perfecting the
bill and putting it through.
Some of the increases were made
on recommendation of the military
committee, which, after framing the
bill, acvi:'.ed increases when the sit

El Paso, Texas. June 28. Ex
citement here over the Mexican con

receipt of the news of a bandit raid
across the border near Hatchita, N.

be that the incident demonstrate!

to the American frontier, and would

Preparations are being rushed in

Mexican reports indicate that
General Trevino, commanding the

has practically completed the dis
position of his troops in preparation
for possible hostilities with the
United States. The command, the
strength of which is variously esti

CARRANZA MUST RELEASE
A PRISONERS OR HE WILL
USE FORCE.
FINAL 'HON IS
EXPEU J TODAY
State Department Has No In
timation as to When Carran
za Will Reply to Note.
Washington, Juna 28. Elia
ao Arredondo, Mexican tmbii
ador designate, this afternoon
received official word from
Mexico City that the demand of
tha United State for the re
Irate of tha American soldier
taken prisoner at Carriial
would be refuted by tha Mexi
can government.
Washington, June 28. Unless
(!en. Carranza surrenders the 23
American troopers held at Chihua
hua City before Thursday night.
President Wilson will probably go
before Congress today and ask for
authority to rescue them by force.
Pending their release the United
States government will not consider .
any offer of mediation or arbitra
tion. The state department has no inti
mation as to when a reply to the
note sent Sunday fnorning demand
ing the immediate release of the sol
diers, might be expected. It was de
livered Tuesday at 11 a. m. Special
Agent Rodgers has been unable to
forecast the action of the de facto
authorities.
Prompt compliance by Congress
with any request the President may
make as to Mexico was forshadowed
today by the calm which prevails in
both houses. Although measures de
signed to prepare for war were un
der consideration and the corridors
of the rapitol hummed with rumors
there was no excitement and discus
sion of the subject on the floor was
avoided. The legislative branch of
the government was plainly waiting
to do its part when what the .tiajcri-
Tgarded as inevitable, should
corne.
Eliseo Arredondo, Mexican am
bassador designate, said he had re
ceived no intimation of the course
his government intended to pursue,
and had not even been advi.ie I o f
tne receipt of the American njie. On
his own responsibility, however, he
sent to the State Department tv,o
vmmunications. One coTtclaM
it the enforcement of a generil eni
,aKo on shipments to Mexico: ilm
ther recites that Mexican citizens
hae been arrested without cau-i in
'Vuforniii and Arizona. They warn
Secretary Wising that the present
situation between the two govern
ments can not fail to be gravely ag
gravated by these matters, although
letting forth that the ambassador
assumes that local authorities, not
the State Department, was responsi
ble for the trouble.
So far as i.i known the State De
partment has not been advised of
the detention of the Mexicans. It is
an open secret, however, that an em
bargo on commerce between the
United States and Mexico is being
enforced effectually by custom and
army officers, without the authority
of a formal proclamation.
Efforts to sound the administra
tion officials anew as to their atti
tude toward some form of arbitra
tion met with a chilling receptinti.
Charles A. Douglas, recently re-employed
as (!en. Carranza's legal ad
viser here, called on Counsellor
Polk 'at the State Department. He
and Dr. Victor A. Rendon, head of
the Yucatan sisal commission, had
received word from Louis Cabrera,
the Mexican finance commissioner,
that Gen. Carranza was disposed to
appeal to the arbitration provisions
of the treaty of 1 S 4 3 , provided the
United States was willing to submit
the dispute to peaceful negotiation.
Mr. Douglas is understood to have
suggested that the arbitration pro
vided for under Section 21 of the
treaty could well be employed to
formulate a definite question as be
tween the two governments, which
in turn might be settled by media
tion. He left the conference witn tne
clear impression that the Washing
ton government would listen to no
mediation suggestions.
It has been very plainly indicated
;that unconditional surrender of the
. American prisoners held at Chihua-
;hua would be the only immediate
Carrsr'a ruM
- hostilities. Whether a mediation pro-
his'posal might be considered
'release is a matter of sp
after their
peculation.
