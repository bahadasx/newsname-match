LIVES IN HISTORY
Old Town of Westchester Saw
Stirring Times in the Days
of the Revolution.
T
im vlsttor to tho village of
Westchester, N. Y., which, by
tho way, 1 tho oldest in all
Westchester county, should
(lance at tho old village store, Just
west of tho causeway. Across the
causeway is a hill occupied by tho
Presbyterian church, the same spot
whoro the British set up a breastwork
to defend themselves in the light of '76.
For old times' snko a stranger would
want to walk out the Pelham road a
llttlo way, to see what remains of the
famous "Spy Oak." It Is a tragody to
see this monarch among trees decapi
tated now; its wonderful height,
gained proudly In its lifo of centuries,
has been hewn, so that Its old friends
almost weep at tho sight. It Is said to
measure 80 feet in girth at the ground,
where Its roots spread.
A British spy, caught by vigilant
Americans, was hanged to its branches,
says tradition; and, furthermore,
strange walllngs of that Itrltish ghost
were said to be audible after dusk.
Walking west from the village
square a short distance one comes to

IN LIBERTY'S NAME
Memorable Scene When Patriots
Signed the Declaration
of Independence.
By GEORGE LEWIS BAILEY
ONE hundred and forty years
ago occurred the memorable
event we celebrate at this
season. There were gathered
In the old etatehouse In Philadelphia
half a hundred men, determined upon
a course that was destined to affect
the history of the world. The Decla
ration had boon written. A committee
had been out all night In Its prepara
tion. Finally the door of the commit
tee room swung open. Three men ap
peared. Thomas Jefferson held the
parohment in an unsteady hand. He
advanced and spread it upon the table.
There was one Question the one Ques

of those who waited: "Shall It be

In its yard are , headstones dating
back as far ss 1713. Upon the tomb
stone of Philip Honeywell, who was

scription was placed:
I.ook on this stone and you will find
My journey's o'ar, and yours bnhlnd;
Think, than, bsfur you turn away,
That yours may and baforo tliia day.
This was one of the early churches
upon which Queen Anno bestowed
gifts. In her day Its chime of bells
was glvon It. Tho old bells have since
been melted and made Into a now
one, which rings Sabbath-day pilgrims
to servlco as of old.
Across the street stands the parish
bouso. This building, says Doctor
Clendenin, tho rector, was the one
used for two weeks as the colonial
capital of the state of New York when
an cpldemlo of fever prompted a sud
den move.
A fow blocks farther west Is the
picturesque rectory, standing quite
alone on a green knoll. Its surround
ing land was part of tho "ancient
Kluhe" given by the town In 1703.
Records state that It was found nec

four acres where Edward Collier's
old lott was," "the eight-acre division
of land in the old lott fronting to the
shoep pasture," and so on.
From 16S3 to 1759 Westchester was
tne shire town. The village was set
tled In 1G42 by Throckmorton (for
whom Throg's Neck was named), who
arrived from Massachusetts with a
group driven thence along with Roger
Williams. They procured permission
to make thotr homes at Westchester,
settling 35 families there. The Dutch
had called the spot Vredeland, mean
ing Land of Peace, and perhaps the
name bud something to do with at

on'bi8 feet in an instant. Ablaze with
the inspiration of the hour, he poured

ripple of uneasiness moved through
the crowd. The speaker sensed It,
and Instinctively knew that the psy

Towering to his tiptoe height, he lift
ed his voice in a ringing crescendo:
"Sign that parchmentl Sign, if the

of my voice, with the last gasp of my

Already men were hastening to

And now, 140 years after, those tones
are echoed and re-echoed around the

ULTIMATUM IS SENT
MEXICAN REPUBLIC
Immediate Release of Captured Negro
Troopers Demanded.
CARRANZA ORDERED ATTACK
President, Following Conference, In
dicates He Will Address Joint
Session of Congress Soon.
Washington, D. C A demand for
the immediate release of the American
troopers taken prisoners at Cerrizal,
coupled with a stern notification that
the United States expects an early
statement of the purposes of the Car
ranza government was telegraphed to
Mexico City Sunday by Secretary Lan
sing. The note discloses that the State de
partment received Saturday a commu
nication from the de facto government
stating that the Carrizal fight was the
direct result of orders to attack Amer
ican anliliera moVinir otherwise than
toward the border, personally issued
by General Larranza to uenerai ire
vino and by the latter communicated
to General Pershing.
In renlv. Secretary LanBintr reauires
that the de facto government transmit
a definite statement "as to the course
of action it has determined upon"
through the usual diplomatic channels
"snd not through subordinate military
officers."
The Mexican communication is con
strued, Secretary Lansing states, "as
a formal avowal of deliberately nosuie
action against the forces of the United
States now in Mexico and of the pur
pose of attack without provocation
whenever they move xrom me ir .pres
ent position" despite the friendly mis
sion on which they are engaged and
which is reaffirmed in the American
rejoinder.
General Carranza is required to
place himself on record formally and
tha nlain intimation lies behind the re
strained language of Mr. Lansing's
communication that force will be met
with force. Apparently, however, the
Waahinirton government is determined
that the de facto government shall not
evade responsibility Del ore tne worio
if war is forced upon tne united
States.
The note and the military situation
of the United States were talked over
at the White House by the President,
with the senate foreign relations com
mittee. After the conference, which lasted
more than an hour, Senator Stone said
the situation was "exceedingly acute."
President Wilson has felt it necessary
to acquaint congress with the state of
affairs and the action taken, through
the foreign affairs committee. It was
indicated that he might desire to ad
dress a joint session of the house and
senate in a day or two, but would not
take this final step until the Mexican
government had been given an oppor
tunity to reply.
Thirty-Three United States Troopers
Known To Have Been Slain
Field Headquarters, Mexico, via
wireless to Columbus, N. M. Twenty
three American soldiers are known to
have lost their lives on the battlefield
at Carrizal, according to a report to
General Pershing Sunday night from
Major Jenkins, commanding the Elev
enth Cavalry column ordered to scour
the country in that vicinity for surviv
ors. Major Jenkins said he had evi
dence that nine American troopers, in
addition to those previously reported
dead, had been killed. Major Jenkins
reported that he had found Captain
Morey hidden in a , house nine miles
from where he was abandoned, and
that his wounds were not dangerous.
Two Allied Warships Sunk.
Paris The minister of marine an
nounced that the Italian auxiliary
cruiser Citti di Messina and the French
destroyer Fourche have been torpedoed
in the Strait of Otranto. The Citti di
Messina, which was being escorted by
the Fourche, was the first victim of the
submarine. The Fourche later attacked
the underwater boat, which submerged
and disappeared. Shortly afterwards
the Fourche herself was torpedoed.
Almost all of her crew was saved.
Panama Election Riotous.
Panama Serious rioting occurred in
the City of Panama Sunday on the oc
casion of the elections. Eighteen per
sons were wounded. There were no
foreigners among them, however. - No
trouble occurred at Colon. One man
was killed in the Province of Chiriqui.

General Strike Nearer Posabiffly;-'
Labor Council Aid Longshoremen
San Francisco Possibility of the
extension of the general Pacific Coast
longshoremen's strike to other trades
became more definite Sunday with the
adoption of resolutions tendering
moral and financial support to the
strikers by the Building Trades coun
cil. Similar action is to be taken by
the San . Francisco Labor council,
which also announced that it would
call upon Governor Hiram Johnson to
force the strikebreakers and guards
hired by the employers to disarm.
The Waterfront Workers' Federa
tion, which includes the stevedores and
maritime unions, has withheld prom
ise of sympathetic strikes, however,
pending efforts at settlement of the
strike.
Hope of a settlement of the long
shoremen's strike was strong early
Sunday on the strength of a statement
of Michael Casey, vice president of
the teamsters union, that the Water
front Workers' Federation will present
to the longshoremen a plan which, if
accepted, would end the Btrike imme
diately. Casey is a delegate to the
Waterfront Workers' Federation,
which met the executive board of the
Pacific Coast district of the longshore
men's union Sunday.
Japanese Liner Unloaded.
Seattle, Wash. When the Japanese
liner Canda Maru arrived from the
Orient Sunday, two gangs of non-union
waterfront laborers, assisted by Japan
ese seamen, unloaded the steamer's
cargo. The Japanese, who were not
permitted on the wharf by the immi
gration authorities, handled the cargo
aboard ship, and the non-union men
did the work on the wharf. The strike
breakers are housed at Pier 6 under
protection of special policemen.

Zinc Find Sells Black Eagle
Mine Quickly for $100,000
Albany That the Black Eagle Min
ing company, of Gates, had been sold
to L. S. Barnes, of Salem, Or., for
$100,000, became known here this
week.
Mr. Barnes happened to pass the
Black Eagle mine while on his way
from an inspection of the Gold Creek
mine in which the owners were at
tempting to interest him. Passing the
ore dump he noticed some formations
which indicated to him that they bad
been formed by fumes from zinc de
posits. He Inspected the mine and
found a vein of this formation in the
side of the tunnel.
A bill of sale was made out before
the reason for Mr. Barnes' desire to
purchase the mine became known.
Work has been started on new shafts.
L. S. Barnes, the purchaser, is the
president of the Capital Journal Pub
lishing company, of Salem, and was
formerly in charge of all the iron
mines held by the Hard man interests.
He is recognized as one of the fore
most mining men of the country.
As a result of the sale the stock
holders in the Silver King Mining
company, the Gold Creek Mining com
pany, the Crown Mining company and
the Ogle Mountain Mining company
are much excited, as all these mines
are in the same district and might be
affected if a real strike has been made.
Prospectors are also much excited and
are staking out claims close by.
10,000 Acres Embraced in
Warm Springs Irrigation District
Vale Malheur county presents a re
sumption of prosperity and a move
ment toward sane and united action
which speaks well for the coming
years.
On May 19 the Warm Springs irriga
tion district was organized and the di
rectors are hastening toward the pre
sentation of a -proposition and bond
issue to the land owners at an early
date.
June 14 the unanimous vote creating
the community improvement irrigation
district, embracning 10,000 acres of
the best land and most improved
farms in Willow River valley, shows
further the awakening spirit of prog
ress and a desire for unity so necessary
for community success.
The creation of this district on Wil
low River brings once more into the
limelight the great and wonderful ca
pacity of the Brogan and Jamieson
country for production of land products
of any kind under climatic conditions
which have carried destruction to the
greater portion of Eastern Oregon and
Southern Idaho.
Judge Daly, Banker, Will Finance
Rebuilding of Burned Lakeview
Lakeview Lakeview is to rebuild
the district destroyed by fire Friday
more substantially than ever. Re
vised estimates place the total loss in
residences, business blocks and per
sonal property at approximately $70,
000, with $15,000 insurance.
Many of those whose property was
destroyed are not financially able to
rebuild with the brick or stone re
quired by the fire ordinances of the
town.
A mass meeting of citizens was held
in the courthouse, which culminated in
a pledge from Judge Bernard Daly
that the Bank of Lakeview, of which
he is president and chief stockholder,
will finance the rebuilding of the en
tire burned area. In 1900 Judge Daly
performed a like service when the en
tire business portion of Lakeview was
destroyed by fire.
Governors May Not Meet.
Salem Because of the Mexican sit
uation and the apparent necessity that
he should remain in Oregon, Governor
Withycombe announced Wednesday
that he would be unable to attend the
Western Governors' conference sched
uled for Salt Lake City on June 26.
Governor Withycombe is secretary of
the conference.
The governor said that in view of
the sudden seriousness of the Mexican
trouble it was not improbable that the
Western conference, as well as the
National Governors' conference, sched
uled immediately following the West
ern conference, would be indefinitely
postponed.

Feed Grain Prices Remain Firm.
Portland The oats and barley mar
kets became stronger at all points on
the Coast as it is believed the govern
ment will require a considerable sup
ply of these feed cereals on the border
and in Mexico. No army orders have
been issued for supplies other than
those already contracted for, so far
as known, but traders look for buying
for this account before long. For the
present it is likely the quartermaster's
department will be amply supplied with
feed Btuffs previously ordered sent to
the regular army posts, which will be
delivered to border points. V
Although the oats market has gained
in strength, there has been no specula
tive trading in the country. Oats
holders are still willing to sell at $28.
At the Merchants' exchange $25.60 to
25.75 was bid, prices 25 to 75 cents
over the offers of Wednesday. No
barley is being offered for sale here,
but at San Francisco futures were
higher. California barley can be laid
down in Portland at practically $28.
There was no trading in wheat.
Prices at the exchange averaged a cent
higher, in response to the Chicago ad
vance. The rain has improved the
Northwestern crop fully 5 per cent. In
some parts of Oregon the gain is esti
mated at 15 per cent.
Atlantic Freight Rates Decline.
Several commodity markets have
been more or less influenced by the in
creased supply of freight room and a '
consequent reduction in freight rates,
says a news bulletin issued by Rens
korf, Lyon & Co., of New York.
Coffee has declined and cotton has
had an advance in this country as a re
stilt of the improvement in the freight
situation, but so far sugar has not re
sponded by any decline. The fact that
the stand taken by this country has
checked the activity of the German
submarines has improved the freight
situation and reduced insurance rates.
There has been a large fleet that was
tied up by ice in North Russian waters
released and the allies have turned
back into commercial life many boats
that have been used as transports. It
looks as if during tha summer freight
congestion at the ports will be, in a
great measure, relieved and this is
bound to benefit generally American
business.
