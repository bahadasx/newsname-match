It the press of Nashville repre
sents the sentiment of the business
houses, Nashville doesn't care to have
anything to do with Hopkinsville, a
city within its best trade territory.
Both of the Nashville papers have cut
the Hopkinsville papers ott tneir cx
change lists, even declining" to have
them paid for on an advertising basis.
The soldiersof Co. D left last. night
for Ft. Thomas and will in all proba
bility soon be on their way to the bor
der. They are a fine body of young
men and boys, who come from the
best citizenship of the county. They
are patriotic, brave and eager to,go.
Hardships await them, but they will
render a good account of themselves.
Mark that.

Mr. Stites said: "Fellow citizens
of Christian county, and members of
Company D:
"Before introducing Mayor Meach

proud of the brave young men who

Lieut. Riley Butler received the
flag and the formal acceptance was by
tho eloquent young attorney, Lieut.
Alvan II. Clark, who said:
"Ladies and gentlemen: It is not
my purposen or my intention to make
a lengthy speech tonight. I desire
simply, and as modestly as I can, to
thank these veterans of the Spanish
American war for having seen fit to
entrust this flag into our care and our
keeping,
My friends, I am deeply moved
tonight. The fires of patriotism and
loyalty have been fanned into flame
by this martial music and by these ex
ercises. I do not know what you
may think about it, but Old Glory
there, unfurled beneath these stars
means something to me. Her stars
and her stripes guarantee to me
freedom of speech and of thought and
tne inalienable right to worship my
God and my Creator as I think best
Liberty is written into her every fold
"These things, my friends, have
been guaranteed to us by the blood of
our fathers shed upon every battle
field of this republic from its incep
tion to this good hour, and I thank my
Gal that I can playnny part in hand
ing down the same principles of Lib
erty and Freedom and of preserving
them inviolate to the generations of
Americans yet to follow.
"As Kentuckians and Americans
we have double traditions to main
tain. I am proud of my State. The
, bood of her sons has cnrichec every
baUlefieId of thfa Republic, and I can
i was going to my Home, 1 saw a
mother whose husband is now in
khaki, bending over her babe. As I
'passed her home, I heard some one
tell her that the call had come for
troops, and before I had passed I saw
her bend her head and heard her cry
of distress, and her words 'Oh, my
God, what shall I do, what shall I do.'
and yet, my friends, that same girl
wife, after hours spent in silent com
munion vith her conscience and her
God, can march bravely to the train,
when that husband loaves, and with a
braW- mtuIc upon her face sny to him,
Renumber dear, when you strike, to
strike for your country and forme.'
"They say that in the Inte conflict
between our country and Spain in the
charge up Snn Juan Hill, the color
sergeant of a regiment was struck by
i bursting shell from the enemy's
guns. Ho toppled and foil, and as
his comrades rushed up and caught
lim, he drew the flagstaff from his
belt, and held Old Glory high aloft,
and said, 'Thank God, boys, the old
flag never touched the ground.' And
I can assure you veterans tonight, for
these boys of Christian county, that
so far as they are concerned, Old
Glory shall never touch the ground.
I here may be many of you, my
friends, who differ politically, as I do,
from the policies of our President
there may be those who are not in
sympathy with his administration, but
I beg you to lay aside those differ
ences in this hour of our country's
need. This is not the time for cavil,
neither for criticism nor abuse. We
have but one President, one Country
and one Flag.
And now, let me beg of you to
stand with bared heads, with a silent
and humble prayer in your hearts to
Our God while we listen tothestrains
of the most beautiful and most sacred
song on earth,
" 'The star spangled banner, long
may she wave,
O'er the home of the free and the
land of the brave.' "
Following these exercises there
was a delightful band concert.
The crowd maintained the very best
of order throughout the entire even
ing and there were many demonstra
tions of approval, all being inspired
by a common impulse to do honor
the soldier boys.

The Austrians, according to the

but the Italians would not be denied.
There has again been a slackening
in the intensity of bombardment on
the various sectors around Verdun,
and only one infantry attack was at

by the Germans on the part of the
village of Fleury, northwest of Ver

It was repulsed.
The Germans also essayed an at

infantry attacks. Petrograd says that
all the attacks were put down by the
Russian fire.
