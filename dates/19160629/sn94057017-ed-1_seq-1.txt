Last week a small centrifugal
pump was put in the well on the
McGillivray place at the north
west corner of the townsite and
C. L. Riley's engine hitched to
it, with the object of pumping
water to irrigate the trees set
out along the streets this spring.
For several days this week the
well has been pumped all day at
the rate of about 150 gallons per
minute. The level of the water
in the well has not been affected
by this pumping, and doubtless
the well would furnish more
water than this amount. About
half the trees are thrifty and
growing beautifully. Probably
one-fourth, or a little more, are
growing, but did not put out at
the toD and have been cut on.
some near the ground and some
several feet above the ground.
About one-fourth have not put
forth leaves at all and are sup
posed to be dead. The dead and
those that were cut off are
classed as diseased. Some of
them may probably will over
come their handicap and make
good trees.

Ben Young says he has the
best crop prospect since he has

George Pugh reports that the
worms have not been good to
him. They have taken half his
crops, so tnat ne nas just aoout
half a stand left. He says his
ground was well cultivated last
year, but the worms came just
the same.
Harlan Matthews reports a
few flea-beetles working on his
beans, but doesn't think they
will do material damage. He
has the finest prospect for beans
he ever had. The cutworms got
about half his corn, but what
remains is very fine.

Mr. and Mrs. Fred Ayers and
children returned from the east
Wednesday of last week. Mrs.

of her grandmother's one hun
dredth birthday anniversary.
Mr. Ayers had been absent about
a week attending to business and
visiting in Kansas and Nebraska,
fretting as far east as Omaha.
He met Mrs. Ayers and the
children at Stella, Nebraska. He
reports wheat looking rather
poorly in western Kansas, but af
ter passing Hutchinson crops
looked well during the remainder
of the trip.
A meeting was held last Fri
day evening at which the ques
tion of choosing a new site closer
in town for the school house was
discussed. It developed that
there was a strong sentiment on
the subject both ways. A num
ber of sites were proposed, some
of them in derision. Those who
contended for a new site finally
agreed upon a site just west of
the Speckmann residence, and in
the election held Tuesday the
Question was put, "Shall the
school nouse remain in trie pres
ent location," and "Shall the
school house be located between
the Speckmann house and the
McGillivray pasture." The pres
ent location got 115 votes, and
the proposed new location 63. So
that question is settled and the
board can get busy just as soon
as they like. From this time
forward we will have ample
school room and facilities, and
people will not be turned aside,
as has been the case heretofore,
on account of a lack in this di
rection. Gov. McDonald has wired the sheriff
here that recruita are wanted for the
New Mexico companies at the border.
DtDutv Sheriff Dee Bobinson has ao
far found three who are ready to go.
Kex Meador has located a
ranch on government land in
Socorro county west of Magda
lena, and will go or send some'
body there next week to put
down a well and make other im
provements preparatory to mov
ing out there. - He will probably
move within a month or two.

heard at Palomas Springs that
Arthur Nisbett had been killed
in Mexico some time ao. The
word came to Palomas through
parties who knew him, but the
report could not be verified.
Matt and George Freilinger
came in Monday evening from
Algona. Iowa, having made the
trip of fifteen hundred miles by
auto. They had quite an inter
esting time.
GAME PROTECTORS ARE BUSY
Albuquerque, May 19. Pre-
paratory to the opening of the
VJLb hunting season, the execu
tive committee of the Albuquer
que Game Protective Association
are appointing a series of field
committees to carry on the work
of the Association in the region
around Albuquerque. The first
of those appointments are
Messrs. Archibald Rea and Wil
liam Blackwel, who will be the
official representatives of the As
sociation in the Sandia Moun
tains. Mr. Blackwel has at the
same time accepted an appoint
ment as Deputy Game Warden,
and together with Mr. Rea has
just had an extended conference
with the officers of the Associa-tion,-in
which plans for the com
ing season were laid out.
Among the matters considered
was the possibility of stocking
the rough1 escarpments of the
Manzano and Sandia ranges with
mountain sheep. It will be
years before this can be done,
but it was decided that, if the
remnants of sheep in the south
ern part of the state can in time
be increased to a point where
the capture of a few lambs would
be feasible, there is every reason
to believe that the rugged rim
country would offer suitable con
ditions for restocking with sheep.
It is planned to make a careful
study of conditions as to feed,
and browse and compare them
with conditions on the southern
sheep ranges so as to determine
the feasibility of the plan.
Mr. Blackwel and Mr. Rea re
port finding several pairs of old
elk horns in Comanche and Jar
amillo canyons. These horns
had the double tine on the brow,
thus identifying them as having
belonged to the regular yellow
stone species of elk.
Some interesting observations
were reported by Mr. Blackwel
as to the value of quail as insect
destroyers. He makes a special
point of protecting the quail on
his ranch at the mouth of Co
manche Canyon, allowing no
hunting at any time. While the
grasshoppers were devastating
crops all over this region last
year, he reports having sustained
no loss whatever, the quail hav
ing kept the pest in check.
"The reports one hears about
quail being so thick in places as
to destroy crops, are a farce,
says Mr. Blackwel. "Quail de
stroy ten dollars in insects to
every handful of grain or garden
produce they eat. They are a
cash asset to any ranch. The
government scientists say every
quail is worth $25 as an insect
destroyer, and I believe the
statement is conservative.
Deer and turkey in the Sandias
are reported as becoming very
scarce, the law having been very
poorley observed in the past.
Auction Sale of Cattle
Twelve head of cows and
calves, 10 head of yearling heif
ers, 30 head of 2 and 3-year-old
heifers, some dry and some to

sell the same at auction in Es
tancia at 1:30 p. m. on Saturday,
July 8th. They will be sold
