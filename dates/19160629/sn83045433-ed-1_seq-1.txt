Penfield.
Department of State.
Washin;ton. June 21. 1916.
Evidence obtained from the captain
and members of crew of the steamer
Petrolite and from examination made
of the vessel under direction of the
Navy Department. convinces this gov
ernment that the Austo-Hungarian
government has obtained an incorrrect
report of the attack on the steamer.
With particular reference to the ex
planation made by the foreign office,
the following information, briefly
stated, has been obtained from sworn
statements of the captain and mem
bers of crew:
No shot was fired across the bow
of the steamer as a aigual to stop.
When the first shot was fired the
aptain was under the impression that
an explosion had taken place in the
engine room. Not until the secon%
shot was fired did the captain and
crew sight the submarine, which was
astern of the steamer, and therefore
they positively assert that neither the
first nor the second shot was fired
across the bow of the vessel.
No Attempt to Ram Sub.
The steamer did uet swing around in
a course directed toward the subma
rine, as alleged in the report obtained
by the Austro-Hungarian govern
ment, but the captain at once stopped
the engines and swung the vessel

Today the German artillery in this re
gion increased its bombardment, and,
followliug the cannonade, infantry was
sent forward, gaining for the moment a
foothold in advanced posts which It was
unable to hold against the French coun.
ter-attacks.

French today in their operations north of
