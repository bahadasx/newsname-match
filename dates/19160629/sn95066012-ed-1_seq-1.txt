VIENNA STATEMENT REFUTED
Report of Submarine Commander Dis
credited In Note Sent to Ambassa
dor Penfield.
Washington, June 29. The Ameri
can rejoinder to Austria regarding the
Austrian submarine attack on the
American steamer Petrolite, made
public yesterday by the state depart
ment, describes the act as "a deliber
ate insult to the Hag of the United
States and an invasion ot the rights
of American citizens," and requests
a prompt apology, punishment of the
submarine commander and payment of
indemnity.
In vigorous language the communiea
tion, sent Wednesday, the 21st, makes
it clear that the United States govern
ment believes the facts of the case en
tirely different from what the
Austrian submarine commander re
ported them to be, and that Immediate
amends are expected.
The Austrian claim that the Pet
rolite's captain voluntarily gave up sup
plies taken from the steamer by the
submarine commander is flatly con
tradicted, as are the claims that warn
ing shots were fired across the Pet
rolite's how before she was
shelled and that her appearance was
such as to justify the submarine com
mander in mistaking her for a cruiser.
The attack on the Petrolite, a
Standard oil tanker, occurred in tho
Mediterranean December 5. A protest
sent soon afterward on preliminary re
ports from the tanker's captain and
crew brought the Austrian communi
cation to which the new American note
replies. The rejoiner is in the form
of u memorandum from Secretary
Lansing to Embassador Penfield at
Vienna.

Man Turned 10,000 Loose to Show How
Harmless They Were.
Cleveland, Ohio. June 27. Ten thou
sand bees loose in a ballroom was the
sight seen by the Woman's Club when
Ernest K. Root of Medina, beo anil
honey expert, shook out a swarm of
bees into the white and gold room of
the club on'Kuclid avenue, to show
how easily the little honeyniakers may
be handled if one knows how.
There were swift glances toward the
door when .Mr. Hoot proposed to open
the little case that held the bees.
'Don't be in the least afraid, they will
not sting you even if they should hap
pen to light on you," promised Mr.
Knot.
He scooped up a handful of the bees
out of the thick, moving brown mass,
put them in his hat, clapped his hat on
his head and went on with his talk.

BY BIG GUNS RAID
1
Activity of Artillery Indicates Pro
nounced Offensive Move
FIND DEFENSES SHATTERED
Steady Stream of Shells Poured Into
German Positions on the Somme
and Vimy Ridge.
London, June 23 The series of
raids by British patroi detachments
continues against the German lront in
Flanders and northern Prance. At one
point, near Angres, north of Souehez,
the Hritish headquarters reports that
the patrol found the German trenches
badly battered by the lire of the Brit
ish artillery. It is presumed that one
of the chief objects of these raids is
to determine the effect of the bom
bardment, which, according to des-
atches fiom tho correspondents on
this front, is still going on.
In one of the raids described in the
British official statement, made by the
Highland Light Infantry near the road
between Verinolles an.l La Bassoe, the
British detachment took forty-six pris
oners:, captured two machine guns and
destroyed two German mine shafts
with a total loss cf two men wounded.
The German War Otlice announces
that these raiding operations under
taken by the British extended from La
Bassee Canal to the district south of
the Somme and were made in conjunc
tion with an intense artillery fire and
mine explosions and under (over of
smoke and gas clouds. According to
the Germans report, all the attacks
were repulsed easily.
Correspondents at the front say that
the British bombardment is continuing
over a broad front, the guns pouring a
steady stream of shells into the Ger
man positions. The region of the
Somme and the Vimy Kidgo were two
points at which the bombardment at
tained unusual violence. The weather
was found to be unfavorably for gas
attacks last night, ' the correspon
dents sav. and the British discontinued
this form of attack alter releasing gas
at several points.

Berlin, June 28, (via London.) An
nouncement was made by the War Of

tions south of that point. The bulle
tin reads:
The'Village of Liniewka, west of So

Otherwise nothing of importance oc
curred on the eastern front.
For reveral days it had seemed that
the fighting on the Russian front had
come virtually to a standstill, the Rus
sians having reached the mountainous
region of Bukowina. which the Aus
trians had selected for a strong stand,
and that neither side apparently was
able to make substantial progress in

ture of Llnewka Village reflects an im

COUNTRY IS ALREADY AT WAR
Does Not Want Mexico But United

Washington, June 28. Cheered by
his Republican colleagues, Uncle Joe
annon made a speech in the House
today in which he urged the Govern
ment "to go into Mexico, clean it up
and establish a government there by
military force." And the sooner it is
done the better, he added. The voter- I

time had come "for Congress to act.''
"We are already at war In Mexico,"
shouted Uncle Joe. "Let us stop call
ing it an 'emergency,' or a 'crisis.'"
Mr. Cannon made his speech in tho
course of the debate on the urgent de
ficiency bill authorizing an appropria

that later on If It becomes material
when the great American citizenry will
be called upon to approve the acts of
the Administration with a view to the

"I hope to God that before Congress

"What would you do if you had the

":f 1 had supreme power I would go
into Mexico, not on an excuse, but I
would have the manhood to say that
nobody can have ponce or protection in
Mexico until a government is set up
there and 1 would establish a military
government, a government of force to
start w ith, and let it be administered
until a MexUan is found strong enough
to maintain order."
"Do you realize that that would
mean war with Mexico?'' interrupted
Mr. Garner.
"Well, we have got war with Mexico.

New Y'ork, June 2!). Charles E.
Hughes, republican presidential nomi
nee announced last night at the end
of an interview with Theodore Rooso
velt, which lasted for more than 2 1-2
hours, that he and the former presi
dent were in "complete accord." Mr.
Hughes issued the following state
ment:
"I was very much pleased with Col.
Roosevelt's letter of indorsement, and
he has expressed himself in a very
kindly way with respect to my tele
gram to the progressive committee. I
wanted to talk with Col. Roosevelt
fully with respect to the issues of the
campaign, and asked him to dine with
me so that we might have that oppor
tunity. He dined with me tonight,
and we had a very delightful inter
view. We talked very fully over all
matters, and are in complete accord.
The evening has been a very pleasant
one."
Mr. Hughes accompanied Mr. Roose
velt from the eighth floor down to the
first floor corridor and even followed
his guest, bare headed, to the automo
bile waiting in Forty-fifth street. Just
before entering his car the Colonel
grasped the candidate's hand and ex
claimed:
"Coed bye and all possible good
luck."
Then as the machine drove away,
Mr. Roosevelt turned around and way
ing a panama which on this occasion
replaced the familiar black sombrero
shouted, "Good luck, good luck, good
luck."
"Isn't the Colonel looking fine?"
sr.id Mr. Hughes as he walked back to
the elevator.
It is understood that Mr. Roosevelt
told Mr. Hughes he would co-operate
heartily with him in any of his plans,
even to the extent of making a speak

SCHOOL MEETING TOMORROW
Will
Be Held at High School at 8
O'clock in Evening.
Tho annual school meeting of Cue
graded district will be held at the high
jcliool tomorrow, Friday, evening June
30 at 8 o'clock. The school -reports
are out and ought to be looked over by
the voters interested.
Bennington now has probably the
best public schools in the state of
Vermont. The state school officials
consider the Bennington high and
graded schools in the first group and
excelled by none.
To keep the schools up to standard
makes the school department one of
the most important in town. The high
school fire tho past year has made a
lot of extra work, but the building has
been lepaired better than before and
tin re is a small balance from the in
surance money.
There has been a reduction of debt
on the district, but the new state law
takes away the state money that the
district has heretofore had and will
make it necessary to raise a tax of !5
cents on the dollar instead of 90 cents
as last year.
The throwing up of the charter of
the gtaded district seems to be desir
able to those who have looked into the
matter and tho trustees ask for the
appointment of a committee to consid
er the question and report to a special
meeting later.

TROOPERS
Immediate Break With De Facto
Government Averted
CRISIS IS MUCH LESS ACUTE
Twenty-Three Negro Cavalrymen
Captured at Carrizal on Way to
Texas Border.
Washington, June 29. An- immedi
ate break between the United States
and the de facto government of Mexico
has been averted by compliance with
the American demand for the release
of the 23 troopers captured in the fight
at Carrizal. Whether a state of war
has been prevented or merely post
poned no one at Washington would at
tempt to say last night. Official infer
mation as to the attitude of Gen. Car
ranza was lacking. Until his response
to Secretary Lansing's note dispatched
Sunday, making two peremptory and
distinct demands is received, there
will be no decision on whether Presi
dent Wilson shall lay the crisis before
Congress.
News of the release of the prisoners,
received early last night in press dis
patches, brought undisguised relief to
high officials. It was accepted as cor
rect, although no announcement had
come through official sources. More
over, it was assumed that Gen. Car
ranza. impressed with the urgency of
the situation, had ordered the captured
cavalrymen started for the border,
without waiting for his announcement
of the action to reach Washington.
While it is generally conceded that
this move lessens tension and mattes
the crisis less imminent, no one con
versant with the grave problem is los
ine sight of the fact that the all-im
portant question of Carranza's attitude
toward the American expedition across
the border to protect the territory and
citizens of the United States from ban
dit outrages remains unsettled. If the
de faet& government stands uion the
orders to Gen Trevino to attack Gen
Pershing's men when they move oth
erwise than toward the border, the
situation actually is just what it was
before, except that there now is a pos
sibility of diplomatic negotiations that
did not exist while the Americans were
held prisoners at Chihuahua.
The preparations of the United
States for war will go steadily for
ward. There will be no interruption
of the rush of national guardsmen to
the border, and Gen Funston will con
tinue disposing of the forces under hla
command as if he expected an imme-.
diate attack from the Mexicans.
San Antonio, June 28. Gen. "Funs
ton received tonight a report from Brig
Gen. George Bell, jr., at El Paso which
stated Gen. Bell had been notified by
Mexican Consul Garcia that the
Ameiican prisoners taken at Carrizal
now are on the way north to Juarez
and probably would arrive there to
morrow morning.
According to the report Consul Gar
cia had received word from Gen.
Jacinto Trevino that the American
prisoners with their arms and ac
coutrements were to be delivered at
once to the American authorities.
The report was forwarded Immedlato
ly to Washington by Gen. Funston.
