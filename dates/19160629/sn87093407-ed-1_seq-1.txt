Pershing hat moved hi* bate
from Cotonia Oublan to a point
five mllet from there. This
move, according to American*
who arrived from the front,
was made after the American
commander informed an
attack by Carranzistas was im
minent.
Arrivals stated that the Fifth
U. S. cavalry, recently sta
tioned at San Geronimo, cap
tured 80 Mexicans and took
them into camp.
Among them was recognized
a Villa colonel, who was prom
i*ed protection if he would
identify the Columbus raiders
in the group. Fearing assas
sination if he betrayed his
companions, the colonel asked
to be masked while he identi
fied the men. He was masked
and placed in a tent with a
small opening. The Mexicans
were marched by in single file
and he identified nine as Villa
raiders. These were sent to
Gen. Pershing's headquarters.
The advance guard of the Nation

expected to reach El l'aso tonight.
