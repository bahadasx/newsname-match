WnshliiRton, Juno 28 An Itnmcillnte
break between tho United States nnd
tlie do facto Kovcrnmont of Mexico lins
been averted by coniplluncc with tlio
American demand for tho release of
the 23 troopers captured In the tight
at Carrlzal, whether a state of war
has been prevented or merely post
poncd no one here would attempt to
snv tonlcht.
Odlclal Information aB to tho atti
tude of General Carranza was lacking,
until his rcsponso to Secretary Wan
sing's note, dispatched Sunday, mak
inc two ncromntory nnd distinct de
mauds, Is received there will he no
decision as to whether President Wil
son will lay thccrlsls before Congress
News of tho relcaso of the prisoners
received early tonight In press (lis
patches brought undisguised relief to
hlch olllelals. It was accepted ns cor
roct, although no announcement had
come through odlclal sources. More
over, It was assumed that Cnrranza,
Impressed with tho urgency of tho sit
uation, had ordered tho captured cav
alrymen started for tho border with
out waiting for his announcement of
the action to reach Washington.
Mmo Lessens llic Tension
While It generally Is conceded thai
this move lessens lenslon nnd makes
tho crisis less Imminent no one con
versant with the grave problem Is
losing sight of the fact that the all-
important question of Carrnnza a atti
tudo toward the American expedition
across the border to protect the terri
tory and citizens of the United States
from bandit outrages remains unset
tled. If tho de facto government
stands upon the order to Oencral
Trcvlno to attack Pershing's men
when the move otherwise than to
ward the border, tho situation actual
ly Is Just what It was before, except
that there now Is a possibility of dip
iomntlc negotiations that did not ex
1st while tho Americans were neid
prisoners.
The preparation of tho United
States for war will go steadily for
ward. There will bo no interruption
of tho rush of national guardsmen to
tho border and General Funston will
ccntlnuo disposing of the forces under
his command as though ho expected
an immediate attack from tho McxI
cans.
Carranza Avoiding- llrcak
Tho fact that Carranza has complied
with one of Mie demands Is accepted
by the more optimistic ollleinls hero
as an Indication that ha Is striving to
prevent a break. Kven though he
again should attempt to plaeo all
blame for tho Carrlzal fight upon tho
American oltlccrs and insist upon Ins
right forcibly to oppose any except
northward movements of American
troops, It Is thought that possibly ho
will stnto his position in such a way
ns to mnko further discussion neces
sary. During any ucgotlnntins, however
the United States will Insist upon free
dom of movement of tho troops in
Mexico and any attempt to Interferi'
with them will bo met by such force
ns Is necessary. This will apply, too
to any period of delay occasioned by
attempts to arrange mediation or arm
t ration.
Tho possibility of Latin-American
offers of mediation In tho crisis again
was widely discussed tonight. Ignacla
Cnledron, minister from liollvin, will
make a second call upon Secretary
Lansing tomorrow to discuss tho sub
ject. Ho will endeavor to ascertain
for tho benefit of himself and his
colleagues whether tenders of good
offices by tho South nnd Central Amer
ican republics would bo entertained
nt this time.
Unwilling to Discuss It
Tho minister said, nfter his first
conferonco with Secretary Lansing
Monday, that ho understood tho Unit
ed States to bo unwilling oven to dis
cuss tho subject of mediation or ar
bitration whllo tho captured Ameri
can troopers remained In custody.
It Is known that powerful Influences
have been brought to bear on Car
rnnza In tho past few days to make
him at least turn over tho American
prisoners. Prominent Mexicans in tho
United States, as well as American
bankers and business interests wKh
Influeuco In Mexican affairs, have
flooded tho chlof with messages. They
all sent him the. same warning that
tho United States government meant
business and that to hold tho prison
ers would mean war.
Secretary IJakor waited nt tho War
Department until Into tonight for a
roport from Ooneral FutiBton on den
oral Trovlno's announcement thnt he
had sent tho cavalrymen to Juarez
to bo sot free. Ho finally went home
without a roport.
Has Xot Studied Xntcs
Secretary Lansing had not studlod
toilay tho trio of communications sub
mitted to the Department within the
last 24 hours by Ellsco Arrendondo,
tho Mexican Ambassador designate.
They protest against tho alleged ac
tions of a largo column of Genoral
I'orshlng'B men toward Mexican clti
unu, agnltiBt tho arrest of other Mex
icans In tho Unltod States, and against
the gonerul embargo, effective without
proclamation, stopping virtually all
shipments to Moxlco.
