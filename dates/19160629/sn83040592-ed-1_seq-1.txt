Had a Big Time.
W.W.Scott attended the Na
tion Democratic convention at St.
Louis and from the tone of the
following letter, addressed to his
son-in-law. Dr. M. L Nichols, of
this city, we rather think the old
gentleman Bad the time of his
young life. Here is what he said:
St. Louis Mo., June 13, 1916.
"I arrived here this a. m., and
spent the day with the Democrat
ic delegation from Kentucky.
"I have spent the day with the
nobility of the Democratic party
of Kentucky, met the governor,
also Senator James, the chairman
of the National Democratic Con
vention, and more U. S. senators
and big officials than ever before.
'I have also met some of the
delegation. Judge Woodson, the
National Committeeman who
gives out the tickets, appointed
me to be in officer in the Conven
tion Hall, so I might have full
power to go anywhere in the hall,
with nothing to do but take in
the convention.
"Dr. Scott is a delegate, and I
am with him We got a room at
the new St James hotel at $4 per
day for our room and we take our
meals out.
"I will stay two or three days
or until the convention closes.
'Wilson will be' the nom
inee and we think the old ticket
will be renominated. Ollie C.
James of Kentucky will be per
manent chairman. I had the
honor of meeting him today.
'I am well and having a great
good time here.
Parcels Post.
The parcels post is growing
more ana more in puoitc tavor.
t is so convenient, taking the
place of the express route with a
great many people. It is cheaper
than express in most instances,
and the delivery is more prompt.
Within a year or two more the
parcels post business will take
care of most of the small pack
ages. As it is now a package
from the size of a postage stamp
to 84 inches length and girth
combined can be sent very cheaply
by Uncle Sam.

rey was not injured. It was found
that he was drunk, and Constable
Horton arrested him. He was ar
raigned in justice court, where
he was fined heavily for running
a car while in a drunken condi
tion. There is a state law which
provides a ' very heavy fine for
driving a car while under the in
fluence of intoxicating liquor.
Some fellow driving a span o
mules stole a lot of copper wire
