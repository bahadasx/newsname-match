f atal f ight Between
Negroes Over Craps
Patrick?Will Toy was sliot
and dangerously wounded Sunday
at Gillespie, five miles north
of here, by Fred Covington.
The ball entered in the left side
near the waist line and ranged
downward through the stomach.
Toy and Covington, who are
both negroes, had been working
on the farm of W. T. Hendricks,
and were shooting craps Sunday
when they fell out over l.">
cents, which resulted in the
shooting.
Mr. Hendricks with difficulty
succeeded in overpowering Covington
and holding him until
Sheriff Douglass could come
from Chesterfield and take him
to jail. After doing this the
sheriff returned and took the
wounded negro to the Florence
hospital where he died of his
wounds.

Editor of The Advertiser:
In this week's issue of The
( Advertiser I notice an article entitled
"Historic Sketches of
t Chesterfield, VV. D, Craig."
My name appearing at the
^ head of the column will create
, the impression that 1 am its au(
thor, but I knew nothing of it
. until I saw the paper.
A little llattery is sweet to the
, iiioj.niu,y 01 me numan iamiiy
r but 1 have never advertised
what I have done or was doing;
, though 1 have tried to do my
duty, as a citizen, to my town,
county and state.
Will you kindly insert this in
your next issue?
W. D. Craig.
The forgoing letter is self-explanatory,
and the editor stands
corrected. We admit that the
head of this article as printed
without introductory remarks
was probably misleading.
It has been a desire of this
editor for some time to publish
a series of historical and bioj
graphical sketches, but the press
i of other matters has prevented
I the realiy.at.irtn of tltic aim
It was while discussing the
unique scheme of Mr. W. D.
Craig to have an auxiliary electric
light plant further down the
same stream to augment the one
I now in use that the sketch of
last week was suggested.
This week a like attempt is
1 made to call to the attention of
| Chesterfield County people an.
, other citizen of sterling worth,
Mr. John A. Arant.
The true American aristocracy
is limited almost entirely to the
south-eastern section of the United
Slates, where the early
I Scotch, Irish, Dutch and English
settled and there remained.
True American aristocracy
makes no attempt to establish
a kinship with the corrupt royialtyof
Europe, but is proud of
| its sturdy ancestors who coniquered
the wilderness, the red
j man, and then turned and whipped
King George 111 and his roy;
ul minions.
The Children's Day service
last Sunday at St. Paul Methodist
Church was witnessed by a
large crowd. It was the oret

Historical Sketches
Mr. John A. Arant 1
In the beginning of the nineteenth
century the first Arant
came to Chesterfield district
from Pennsylvania. The Arants
are descended from the Quaker
sect and the first of this name
to settle in this county was true
to the outstanding characteristic
of the early settlers of this
region, and the subject of this
sketch, J. A. Arant, lives only a
short distance from the site of
the first settlement made more
than a century ago on the long
hill which slopes gently to the
banks of Lynches creek. This
creek was formerly called by the
Indians of the region Bush Wall
Kiver and was noted for the
CTftm? t.liat. alinniuljrl in fho
swamps and lowlands. Lt has
only been a short time ogo, it
will be remembered,! when a
large black bear was killed near
the head of Bush Wall or Lynelioe
Kiver. The name Lynchep
is in honor of an old settlement
of Lynches who ran a trading
post near where Tradesville,
Lancaster county, now is located.
The subject of this sketch is a
quiet unassuming farmer who is
proud of his calling. By close
application to his farm and by
applying principles of scientists
or which ho has worked out for
himself he has been forced to
enter into other lines of activity
being a director in all the principal
banks of this section. Still
his main stay is his farm, where
I 1 i * " 1 *
ne nas macie good nnanciaiiy
ami others might profit by his
example.
There was never any poorer
looking land than the Arant
home place when John Arant
took charge, being then only a
boy. And mind you this place
was not bnilded with Charleston
River dirt, or commercial fertili- ^
zer, whichever you are minded
to call it, but raising of cattle
and rotation of crops has made it
into a regular garden spot. No
matter how dry or how wet the
seasons are there is never any
change in the appearance of the
crops on this land, as the plant
food is in the soil and is absorbed
as nature dictates. For years
he has put the first bale of cotton
011 the market of Monroe,
Union county N. C-, and none
of your dog tail sample but some
of the same kiiul of cotton that
"Befo de War" had a special
quotation on the Liverpool Exchange
as the "Union County
Cream," and commanded a price
of several cents more than the
regular staple.
In conclusion, this article refers
to common knowledge of
the people of the county when
it states that although quiet,
peaceable and unassuming. .John
A. Arant is unafraid, and more
than that has ever been the balance
wheel of this section which
is peopled by honest hard working
but impetous folks. Many a
time by his cool clear judgment
and love of peace has trouble
been averted in this section
and it has been commonly surmised
that had he been present
there would have been n o
Trouble at l'ageland about one
year ago between the two factions,
that was recently settled
in the criminal court of Chesterfield
County.
