George Was'iington as you all
know,
The bravest ar.d wisest of all

He was elected president,
As no other man could have

He went to war at the trumpets
first sound,
And not one word did he say;
Until he was on the battle line
On the battle line far away.
And he fought well and bravely
too.
And not a single complaint did
make.ror did he shed a tear.

- Robert Lovtman,
OUR NEW HIGH
I
For Marion Bond Election Must
Carry-A Word to The
Voters. Important!
Next Saturday July 1, the vot
ers of Marion will have another
opportunity to help make Marion
a bigger and a better town. '
Marion has always been strict
ly a school town and during its
years of steady growth the
school has been an important
factor in making the town what
it is today. As our Jittle town
has prospered, the school bas .
grown and today we find that
our present building, and equip
ment are absolutely inadequate
to meet the needs of our town
and county. Last year the high
school with an enrollment of 108
was so crowded that the halls
had to be used as study rooms,,
and after the second term began
miny deserving young men and
women, who are seeking an edu
cation, were turned away from
lack of room.
There are 125 cr mere common
school graduates in the county
this year and many of them have
already expressed a desire to en
ter high school in September.
With the present building and
equipment, the school cannot
care for them.
This is our day of opportunity
and if we fail to provide for
these-our own boys and girls,
who are merely asking for a
"chance" in life, if we as voter
fail them now, at this time when
we have this golden opportun ity
to make cur. school better arid at
the same time to render service
to cur own pec pie., if we fail now
a "wayfaring man" can see
what the result will be. ... '
But the citizens of Marion' are
net going to fail, they have never
failed us in the past and we are
sure that they will not fail us in
tuis hcur of need. The school
children in Marion and Critten
den county are asking you for &
chance to make the most of life;
they are pleading ' with you to
give them, by your vote, the
kind of an education which will
make life easier ar.d happier for
them. We are sure that you will
not deny them '
If you believe in Marion, in
your school and in the childhood
of Marion and Crittenden county
help us by jour vote and in
fluence to give us the room and
the tquiprr.ert, which are neces
sary to make the Marion High
School meet the needs and the
demands of the boys and girls of
this rart of the state.
Yours for better, schools,
V. L Christian, Supt.
Hollis Franklin, Prin.
The election will be held fit
the shcol auditorium from 1 p.
m. to 6 p. m. next Saturday,
July 1st.
