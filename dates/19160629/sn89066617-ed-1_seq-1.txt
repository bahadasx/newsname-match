William Knop, 18 years old, and
Harry Roberts, 11, both of 111 mo, were
drowned in the Diversion channel
shortly before 5 o'clock yesterday aft
ernoon. Knop lost his life in an at
tempt to rescue his little comrade.
The two boys, both suffering from
cramps, struggled in the water for
several minutes before they sank for
the last time. Although helpless,
young Knop died attempting to save
the life of Harry Roberts. They dis
appeared under the water locked in
embrace.
The news of the tragedy came as a
shock to the people of Illmo, where
both boys were well known and en
joyed a host of friends. A crowd of
men hurried to the scene as soon as it
was learned that the lads were dead,
and a search was made for the bodies.
The body of Knop was recovered ear
ly in the evening, but it was late last
night before the corpse of little Harry
Roberts was dragged from the water.
The two boys, with Lloyd Norman
and several others, went to the Diver
sion channel, which is about two miles
from Illmo, to fish and swim. All of
the boys were considered good swim
mers. -They fished for a while and
then decided to go in swimming.
For more than an hour they re
mained in the water, diving, swim
ming and sliding down the bank.
Knop was the first to suggest that it
was time to prepare to return home,
and they emerged from the water.
The boys had finished dressing and
were just about to depart for Illmo,
when Harry Roberts fell in.
' It was while he was attempting to
wash the mud from his feet that the
accident occurred. He was standing
on one foot and splashing the other in
the water when the wet ground under
him gave away and sent him into the
water.
As he was a good swimmer, his
playmates were not alarmed, but on
the other hand were amused at the
incident. But he had hardly reached
the water when he shouted for help.
"I have cramps; come and get me,"
he cried, and the laughter on the bank
subsided.
"I'll get you," promptly responded
William Knop, the son of Charles H.
Knop, an Illmo saloonkeeper, and he
plunged into the water. He seized the
Roberts boy under the arms and start
ed for the bank when he was suddenly
doubled up with pain.
"Help! Help! I have cramped,"
shouted Knop to his comrades on the
bank. The boys were locked together,
young Roberts clinging to his rescuer
with death-like tenacity. They went
under together, but a moment later
t-ame to the surface.
Lloyd Norman rushed to their as
sistance, but just as he plunged into
the stream the two boys went down
again. The water where they disap
peared is probably twelve feet deep,
and they never came up again
The boys on the bank were panic
stricken when they realized that their
two companions had lost their lives.
Several jumped into the water in the
hope of locating the lads before life
was extinct, but their hopes were
futile.
The boys who had not re-entered the
water, hastened to Illmo to sound the
alarm. The father of the two boys
and a crowd of other men hurried back
to the drainage ditch. The channel
was dragged for more than an hour
before young Knop's body was recov
ered. Several hours later Harry Rob
ert? was taken from the channel.
While they sank locked in each other's
arms, their bodies were found several

HELEN WILLIAMS
AND G. A. CROWE
WED AT JACKSON
Ceremony Is Performed In A
Bower Of Flowers At
Bride's Home.
START HOUSEKEEPING
AT SULLIVAN SOON
Couple Departs On Honeymoon
Trip Destination Is
A Secret.
One of the most beautiful home
weddings in the chronicles of Jack
son's 100 years of social life, was pro
nounced the nuptials of Miss Helen
Williams and George A. Crowe, who
were married shortly after noon yes
terday at the home of the bride's
mother in the northern part of Jack
son. The decoration, colorful and with
the distinction of originality, set off
the fine old Williams .home in a man
ner never before rivaled in Jackson.
The wedding took place at half past
12 o'clock. Rev. Maple of the Cape
performed the double-ring ceremony.
The bride is a daughter of Mrs. J.
W. Williams and is widely known in
Cape County. She formerly was head
of a school in Sullivan, Mo. Mr. Crowe
is a young merchant at Sullivan, and
it was not until after Miss Williams
went to Sullivan to teach school that
the couple became acquainted.
The ceremony was performed in a
bay window at the Williams home.
This nook in the grand old house was
curtained off by a grill work of pink
and white ribbons and between the
curtains a large basket of flowers was
suspended from the ceiling.
The bride and bridegroom, together
with the minister stood beneath the
flower hanging-basket as the ceremony
was performed.
The entire first floor of the Williams
home was luxuriantly decorated with a
wealth of pink and white roses as well
as countless sweet-pea blossoms and
palms and ferns. The bay window in
which the ceremony was conducted
was made into a bower of flowers by
the banks of palms and ferns, togethei
with roses and sweet-peas.
The bride descended the steps of the
home on the arm of her brother, J. D.
Williams, who gave her away. She
was preceded to the window by Mr.
Crowe, Miss Irene Williams, the maid
of honor, and Harrison Williams, an
other brother of the bride, was Mr.
Crowe's best man.
At the altar of roses and flowers,
4-year-old Russell Vandivort, son of
Mr. and Mrs. Clyde Vandivort, carried
the rings in a large pink rose. The
little boy was dressed in white.
Miss Minerva Crowe, a sister of the
bridegroom, played the wedding march
from Lohengrin, and Kenneth Wil
liams, a brother of the bride, sang a
solo.
Miss Williams was dressed in a
shimmering white organdie and wore
a large white hat. Her sister, who
was bridesmaid, was dressed in pink
and wore a pink hat with a large bou
quet of pink roses.
Following the ceremony the couplG
departed for St. Louis, whence they
will depart on an extended honeymoon
trip. They have not disclosed their
honeymoon itinerary and it will be
several days before they will be at
home in Sullivan, Mo.
The couple received almost countless
gifts from their friends. When they
return to their home in Sullivan they
will go to housekeeping with a kitchen j
elaborately furnished in enameled
ware and aluminum, the gift of an
uncle of the bridegroom.
Many pieces of silver, linen, china
and articles useful in the establish
ment oi a nome are numDered among
the wedding gifts. They received sev
eral complete sets of china.
Immediately after the ceremony a
buffet luncheon of two courses was
served to the guests, who were close
friends and relatives of the bridal
couple. Those who were present at
the wedding were: Mr. and Mrs. Allen

feet apart. It is believed that the
Roberts boy released his rescuer as
they disappeared beneath the water
and that in his struggle to reach the
surface again, Knop carried himself
away from his companion.

THE CAPE COUNTY HERALD, CAPE GIRABDEAU, MISSOURI, JUNE 29. 1916.
GARDNER SHOWS
TRICK TO ROB
PEOPLE OF VOTE
Assails Anti-Saloon League
and Shows-up Proposal
for Secret Agreement.
600 JAMS COURT ROOM
TO HEAR HIM SPEAK
Will Stand Or Fall By Right Of
People To Vote, He
Declares.
In an expose of the Missouri Anti
Saloon League's attempt to rob the
people of the right to vote on prohibi
tion for Missouri, Colonel Fred D.
Gardner last night assailed the organ
ization and defied its leaders in his
race for the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination.
"The Democratic party don't want
any hypocrite or four-fiusher," he ex
claimed. "The Democratic party puts
its cards on the table and shows its
hand in the open. And I will stand or
fall on the proposition that I'll not
take away from the people of this
State the right to vote on the question
of prohibition."
Colonel Gardner's address was deliv
stood in the corridor outside and upon
Common Pleas courtroom and many
stoo din the corridor outside and upon
the stairs. More than 600 men heard
the speech and several times during
his address, Colonel Gardner was in
terrupted by applause.
Colonel Gardner plunged into the
question of prohibition and the at
tacks that have been made upon him
by the Anti-Saloon League at the
outset of his speech, and, showed how
by political trickery and a proposed
"secret agreement" the organization
endeavored to disenfranchise the en
tire State on the question of prohi
bition. He also discussed the Gardner Land
Bank bill which will be submitted to a
vote of the people for their approval.
He was author of the bill, which pro
vides a system of rural credit and aid
for the farmer.
"I have been asked why the Anti
Saloon League is opposed to me,"
Gardner said. "The first and most im
portant and fundamental reason is
that the Anti-Saloon League never has
been known to support a red-blooded,
fighting, Bryan Democrat for Gov
ernor. "The second reason is that they al
ways have attempted to see a Demo
crat nominated whom a Republican
could beat. I say to the Democrats:
Are you willing to see three men sit
ting around a table in St. Louis
Republicans tell you whom you shall
nominate for Governor?
"I am fighting for a Democracy and
the League has made its attack upon
me. The League also struck its dag
ger deep into the back of a Democrat
like William S. Cowherd.
"The superintendent of the anti
saloon league in St. Louis boasts that
he was rocked in the cradle of Penn
sylvania Democracy. I was rocked in
the cradle of Kentucky and Tennessee
Democracy where they take their
ticket straight.
"Here is an attack upon me, a libel
ous attack upon my character, in a
Republican paper that is trying to tell
you Democrats how to vote to nomi
nate your candidate for Governor.
"Isn't that the nigger in the wood
Dile? A Republiican paper trying to
tell you how to vote. We don't want
any hypocrites or four-flushers in this
...
business.
"This organization wrote me a let
ter when I became a candidate ior
Governor in which they asked me:
If you are elected Governor, will you
. . ? j t.:v:t: u:il
sign a taie-wiae pronmuiua um
which bears a clause saying that the
bill provides for a measure for the
public safety and peace of Missouri?'
"They told me in that letter that my
reply would be kept onfidential.
"What does the party think of a
candidate who would stoop to sign
such a secret agreement with that
organization? The Democrats put the
cards right out on the table and show
their hands. I will stand or fall by
the proposition that I'll not deny the
right of the people of this State to

MRS. AUGUSTA HEUER
DIED AT 10:30 P.M.
Had Been 111 Since Sunday
With Inflammatory
Rheumatism.
Mrs. Augusta Heuer, member of the
well known Heuer family of Cape
County, who was left wealthy by the
death of her husband, August Heuer,
died at 10:30 o'clock last night at her
home on the Perryville road after be
ing ill since Saturday night.
Two physicians had been in almost
constant attendance upon her yester
day and last night the end was ex
pected at any time. The exact charac
ter of her illness was not determined
by her physicians, but it is believed
she suffered with inflammatory rheu
matism.
Mrs. Heuer lived on the Perryville
road in the first house north of the
Jackson gravel road and across from
Faire-rounds park. Late Saturday
night she began to suffer an acute
pain in the ends of the fingers of her
hands. This gradually worked its way
up into her arms, and Sunday her con
dition was so serious that a doctor
was summoned. Within a short time
a second physician was called into
consultation.
Mrs. Heuer would have been 65
years old on July 13. She was born
on the farm now occupied by David C.
Masterson, northwest of the Cape.
Her fi-ther was Charles Meyer, a well
known farmer.
H.-r husband, August Heuer, has
been dead two and a half, years. He
owned considerable land northwest of
this city and on his death he left much
of the property to their children as
to her.
Funeral arrangements last night
had not been made, but is was said
that the funeral probably will be held
Saturday. Burial will be in a private
cemetery on the homestead farm about
six miles out of the Cape on the rsce
ly's Landing road.
Mrs. Heuer is survived by seven
children, 25 grandchildren and one
great jTandt'hild.
She was the mother-in-law of Hen
ry Brinkopf, who is a Republican can
didate for Sheriff. The children and
grandchildren who survive her are as
follows:
Mrs. Henry Brinkopf, who has seven
children William C, Walter J. Henry
A., Leon F., Mamie, Theresa and Pau

TO PRINT AND PRINTS IT FIRST
Flood Converts
Rat-Trap Into A
Home For Fishes
When Boys At Egypt Mills
Find New Fish Catching
Machine, They Bait Traps
and Get Big Hauls.
How a rat trap one of the large,
old-fashioned, wire-mesh kind with
room enough for a dozen rodents was
converted into a fish trap yesterday
was told in the Cape by C. H. Maev
ers, mayor of Egypt Mills.
In the vicinity of Egypt Mills, the
success of the rat trap as a fish
eatcTTer lias been so marked that every
one who fishes at all has substituted
a rat trap for his trout line.
The vogue started in this way. Sev
eral days ago Luke Funk, while doing
a house-cleaning stunt at the home of
Alvis Ritter, threw away a large rat
trap. He tossed it over the fence and
forgot about it.
Ritter lives near the Flora creek J
in fact, the creek passed within a few
feet of his door. The trap landed on
the bank and recently when the high
water struck there, the trap was inun
dated and swept along till it finally
landed along the bank in the water.
A few days after the storm that
brought the creek up to flood level had
passed, the sons of Sam Young, while
playing along the creek, came upon
the rat trap. They hauled it out of
the water and found it filled with fish.
They were large cat fish, and there
were so many in the trap that they
scarcely had room to wriggle around.
They were caught like rats in a
trap. The boys took the idea in hand
and began baiting the trap. The cage
works just as well for fish as for rats,
for they have been making big hauls
regularly ever since their discovery of
the innovation.
