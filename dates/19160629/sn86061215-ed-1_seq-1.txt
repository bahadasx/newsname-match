Word Comes That Carranza
Has Completed Reply
to U. S. A. Demand
NATURE OF ANSWER
IS NOT HINTED AT
Delay Caused By Mexicans'
Desire to Keep Right
With Latin States
Washington, D. C., June 28.—Spe
cial Agent Rodgers at Mexico City, in
a brief telegram dated yesterday and
received at the state department early
today, said he expected to be handed
today Carranza's reply to the Ameri
can note demanding the release of
soldiers taken prisoner at Carrizal.
There was nothing to Indicate to
day that the Washington government's
position had undergone any change.
Officials still expected President Wil
son to go to congress tomorrow if
Carranza failed to act or replied unfa
vorably. Anything short of immediate
release of the American troopers will
be unsatisfactory. No suggestions or
proposal of negotiations in this matter
will be accepted.
Mr. Rodgers' statement thr", Carran
za officials appeared to be conducting
an inquiry into the Carr*^il clash was
interpret here as ir Seating that the
reply wou»* support previous asser
tions that a. nerlcan troops were re
sponsible rathteV than that a change of
attitude -was to be expected.
Eliseo Airedondo, the Carranza am
bassador designate, still had received
no word early today from his chief.
Wante Outside Support.
Carranza's delay is believed here to
be due '%rgely to his hope to have
South and Central American countries
agree fully to his course before he
takes a final step.
President Wilson today received a
long line of senators and representa
tives. Senator Lewis of Illinois was
one of the callers who discussed the
Mexican problem.
"The president expressed the wish
to me," said Senator Lewis, "that
whatever discussion there might be
in congress on the Mexican situation
should be conducted entirely in a non
partisan manner."
John R. Sllliman, consul at Saltillo,
who now is at Eagle, Pass, Tex., ad
vised the state department of the re
ceipt by Dr. Atl, editor of a Mexico
City labor paper, of a telegram from
Gen. Carranza saying he was prepared
to do everything possible to avoid a
break with the United States.
Reason for Apprehension
BI Paso, Tex., June 28. —Fresh
cause for apprehension was found
along the border today in news of the
gathering of strong forces of former
Villistas under notorious chieftians in
the vicinity of Juarez.
Oen. Jose Plores, commanding 800
Infantrymen, is reported in Juarez
after making peace with the de facto
government. Gen. Manuel Banda once
a Villa subordinate known to be across
the Rio Grande, and Manuel Medi
navietia and Jose Ysabel Robles also
have taken advantage of the amnesty
granted by Carranza. Col. Castillo,
former Villa leader, has joined Gen.
Gonzales' garrison in Juarez.
Former Villa adherents, who are now
refugees in El Paso, are under close
surveillance by civil and military au
thorities.
Although the embargo of munitions
still is enforced rigidly at points of
entry, several wagon loads of food
stuffs held up at the International
bridges were released today after the
consignors received permission from
Washington to send them across.
Mexican refugees from the mining
districts of southern Chihuahua
brought stories today of the organiza
tion of "dynamite squads" in Gen.
Trevino's army. They Bald it is plan
ned that, should it become apparent In
the event of war that the de facto
troops could not hold the railroads, to
destroy them.
Hostilities Near
Nogales, Arizona, June 28.—Amer
ican occupation of Nogales, Sonora,
loomed close today when eight Mex
ican soldiers were driven back by a
U. S. sentry post as they tried to cross
to the American side.
The Mexicans withdrew and Major
William Brooke, stationed in the immi
gration office on International street,
ordered his men to "drop anybody you
see acting suspiciously. If a shot comes
from over there we'll go straight
across."
E
NDULGE IN HIS
TO GET HARDENED
FIRST WORK AFTER REACHING
BORDER WILL BE CONDITION
ING FOR CAMPAIGN.
San Antonio, Texas, June 28. —Blis
tered feet and sunburned noses will
be prevalent among the national
guardsmen now under orders within
two days after they reach the border.
The hardening process will begin at
once. It will continue until they are
fit to duplicate the marches made by
Gen. Pershing's men.
Unless circumstances make it im
possible, some part of each command
will go on a hike each day.
These marches will be made under
conditions such as obtain on active
campaign as nearly as possible. The
guardsmen probably will be started
with a march of five miles carrying
full kit and the regulation amount of
ammunition. The distance will be in
creased until the men are able to cov
er thirty miles a day and finish fresh.
Equal attention will be paid to con
ditioning cavalry and artillery horses
and pack mules. Civilian truck driv
ers now handling big motor transport
units will put their machines to every
test.
Illinois and Wisconsin troops will
be wrapped in luxury compared to the
other guardsmen, If, as is probable,
they are quartered near the camp at
Ft. Sam Houston, now being used as
a citizens' military training camp. The
civilian camp will end June 30. The
camp Is a model one, equipped with
everything known to military science
for the health and comfort of the men.
Arrangements are being made today
for a central Red Cross supply station
here which will care for the eastern
seotlon of the American line. The
western section will be supplied from
a depot in El Paso.
Orders for Four States
Chicago, June 28.—Orders were is
sued today by MaJ. Gen. Thomas H.
Barry, in command of the central de
partment of the U. S. army, for the
immediate movement to the border of
all units of the Illinois, Missouri, Kan
sas and Wisconsin national guard
which are "reasonably ready."
The following statement was Issued
at Gen. Barry's office:
"Orders have been issued directing
the dispatch of all units in Illinois,
Kansas, Missouri and Wisconsin,
when mustered in, examined and rea
sonably ready. The Illinois cavalry
will go to Brownsville, Tex. All oth
er Illinois troops to San Antonio. Kan*v
sag troops will go to Eagle Pass, Tex.
Missouri troops to Laredo, Tex. Wis
consin troops to San Antonio, Tex.
Other troops will be dispatched when
ever reported reasonably ready:"

ments of infantry.
Protest U. S. Outrages
Washington, D. C., June 28.—A note
protesting against outrages against
Mexican citizens, alleged to have been
committed by an American force 3,000
strong marching from San Geronimo
toward Valle, was sent to the state de
partment today by Ellseo Arredondo,
Mexican ambassador designate, on in
structions from the Carranza foreign
office.
Vigorous complaint against the al
leged arrest and mistreatment of 300
civilians at La Cruz is registered in the
note, with a request that the officers
responsible be punished and steps
taken to prevent a recurrence of such
fin Incident.
Apache scouts with the Americans
were charged with brutal treatment
of Mexican people.
The column referred to is presumed
to be a part of Gen. Pershing's main
force moving northward from the ad
vanced base at Namlquipa in accord
ance with orders to draw in the lines
in preparations for a possible general
assault, by Mexicans.
Cavalry Gathers
Columbus, N. M., June 28. —Large

There was no disagreement, how

MAIM EXPECT TO NO
VISIT COMPANY
Relatives of Guardsmen to
Be Taken in Autos to
Camp Dodge Sunday
HUNDREDS OF CARS
MAY MAKE THE TRIP
O A
the Number That They
Can Accommodate
Over thirty people have signified
their wish to go to Des Moines Sun
day by autos, to visit relatives who are
members of Co. at Camp Dodge. It
is thought now that there will not be
sufficient cars to take other relatives
than parents and wives. It is expects
ed that there will be 200 cars repre
senting Ottumwa and vicinity Sun
day. A hearty invitation has been ex
tended to anyone wishing to make the
trip, to take part in the parade at Des
Moines. Ottumwa flags and pennants
will be given to car owners at the
Commercial club to decorate with.
The committee urges that people
of the following: Creath & Boone,
148 Jesse Canfleld, 109 J. N. Weiden
feller, 436 R. J. Shanahan, 48. Wives
and parents who wish to be taken in
autos should communicate with F. T.
Lynch, 322. The committee asks that
people owning cars, even if they have
room to carry only one person, report
to them, for there will be plenty to
accommodate.
The care will leave Ottumwa Sunday
morning from 4 o'clock to 7:30, ac
cording to the speed of the automo
biles, but all must be at the state fair
grounds at 10:30 for the start will be
made from there to Camp Dodge at
that time. The committee wishes to
Impress the merit of the excursion
upon Ottumwa car owners, for the
guardsmen are liable to be called to
the border at any time and may not
even be at Camp Dodge Sunday, al
though they are expected to be there
at least that long.
The committee in charge of the big
auto excursion announce that in order
to accomplish what is desired, all re
latives of the soldier lads cannot be
accommodated. Every parent and
wife of any of the guardsmen will
however, be provided a seat in some
car for the trip to Camp Dodge. The
only expense any of those persons will
be put to is for their meals while
away. The car trip each way is pro
vided gladly by the promoters and the
owners of the cars who desire that no
parent or wife of a guardsman be left
behind who can find It possible to go
and desire to do so.

ORDERS YET
BELIEF GROWS THAT MILITIA­
MEN WILL BE KEPT IN CAMP
UNTIL EQUIPPED.
Des Moines. June 28.—As far as
could be learned today, no orders
have been received for troops of the
Iowa national guard to entrain for the
Mexican border. No orders had been
received by the adjutant general today
and communication with Camp Dodge,
twelve miles outside the city, was
virtually cut off because the single
telephone at the camp was reserved
for military purposes until other in
struments could be Installed.
Officers announced late last night
that permission had been granted to
advance the age to which men can be
enlisted to 45 Instead of 36, as form
erly.
It was the consensus of opinion
among officers of the guard that the
Iowa troops might be held in camp for
some time. The fact that ordnance
equipment is being sent here was be
lieved to Indicate that the war depart
ment intends to equip the troops for
service at the camp and not on the
border as had been believed.
Medical examination of enlisted
men continued today. About ten per
cent were being rejected for various
reasons.
