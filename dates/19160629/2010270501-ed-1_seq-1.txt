UNION TEMPERANCE RALLY
4ies of V. C. T. IT. I Jive Interesting
ITogruii at Baptist Church on
Ijmt Sunday livening
At a union temperance meeting at
Ihe Baptist church last Sunday even
ing, held under the auspices of the
Alliance Woman's Christian Temper
ance Union, there was a large attend
ance, showing a deep interest in the
subject of the evening, which was
the adoption of the proposed consti
tutional amendment in Nebraska
Bezt fall.
The program as previously pub
lished in the Herald was rendered
with only slight changes. It looked
like a short program but turned out
to be too long for patience, even of
an interested audience, on a hot sum
mer evening. It is probable that
hereafter the program committee will
rensor the numbers to be rendered to
sue that they come within the proper
time limits.
A UDion choir from several church
es furnished the music, or rather led
in the Blnglng, which whs participa
ted in by the congregation. Mrs.
A. A. Layton made the opening pray
er and Mrs. J. W. Reed read the
Scripture lesson of the evening.
Rev. H. J. Young, pastor of the
Chrlfttan church, made a short, snap
py talk on temperance with refer
ence to the adoption of prohibition in
Nebraska. This was the only number
that was announced on the program
js "short" and about the only one
that could be properly so designa
ted. Mrs. Geo. Gaddis gave a reading:
lire. Bigncll read one of Captain
llobson's temperance speeches, se
lected by Mrs. Fernnld, but not trad
by her on account of illness; Mrs.
Glenn read a paper on 'Trepared
jiees;" the collection was received,
and Mrs. J. B. Cams closed the ser
vice with prayer.
On the whole, the program was
nplcndid. The reference to its length
above made is not intended as a ids
anragement of its quality in any way.
It was appreciated by the audience,

those proposals. The general com
mittee representing the employes on
each railroad will determine which

of their company. Nothing in the
settlement that may be reached on
the above submitted articles is to be
construed to deprive the employes on
any railroad from retaining their
present rules and accepting any rates
that may be agreed upon or retaaln
ing their present rates and accepting
any rules that may be agreed upon."
The following reply was made on
March 30:
Iteply of Ihe lUllroads
' Your committee of March 29,
giving notice of your desire to revise
present wage schedules and agree
ments, according to certain propos
als made a part of thai notice, has
this day been, received.
"The present standards of rates
and working condition have oeen
very lari'ley fixed by mediation and
arbitration, and this company feels
that they are adequate and even lib
eral to the employes. This Compa
ny has no desire to chanue either the
existintt rates of pay or the working
rules, nor to reduce the earning pos
sibilities of the employes under their
existing rules, but Inasmuch as your
proposals contemplate fundanientl
changes in operating methods and
practices on which the schedules
have been built up, this Company
he-cry tis notice in conformity
with the schedules now In effect that
in connection with and as a part of
the consideration and disposition of
your prosopals there shall be open
for consideration and disposition
those proivsions In the schedules and
practices thereunder governing com
pensation in the classes or service
affected by your proposals or those
in conflict with the following prin
ciples as they apply to ruch classes:
"(a) No double compensation
for the same time of service.
"(b) The ame classification for
'he purposes of compensation to be
applied to all members of a train and
MOVING
!.- 'IKlil.l
engine crew.
te) Two or more differently
paid classes of servic e performed in
the same day or trip to be paid pro-
portlonato rates according to the
class of service with not less than
a minimum day for the combined
service."
For the purpose of interpreting
the application or paragraph (a) of
this reply in connection with the con
sideration and interpretation of your
Conn 35, without Interfering with
existing seniority rules, the following
was submitted to your representa
tives by the National Conference
Committee of the Hallways:
"A road man's time will start from
the ti mo he Is required to report for
duty, and except where tied up be
tween terminals In accordance with
existing agreements all work and de
lay required at Initial terminal and
en route will bo paid as continuous
time or mileage. At final destina
tion, existing rule or rules concern
ing additional sen ice afier arrival,
final terminal delay, etc., not to be
disturbed, and will be paid for pro

the overtime limit of the run. Time

Joint conferences betwen your rcp
recentatives and the National Con
ference Committee of the Hallways
representing the railways of the
United States, were held in New
York t'ity commencing uJne 1st and
concluding uJne l&th..
Your requests and the contingent
oped that the confik-Ung views U j
your representatives and of the Na
tional Conference Committee or the
Railways could not be harmonized
and, therefore, the following formal
reply was made to yoisr representa
tives: Iteply of MaiutCffV Oitanilttt
"The National Conference Commit
tee of the Railways has carefully
considered your proposals and yrur
explanations of their meaning and in
tended application. In our Judg
ment, no reasons deveVoed during
our conferences to justify the extra
ordinary changes in operating meth
ods and practices and the large ex-
penditures ror additional facilities
which your proposals Involve; nor
was anything presented to Justify
your requested radical revision of the
established bases of compensation
for men in engine, train and yard
service. The present rates and rules
are largely the result of recent arbi
tration awards; and, in our Judgment
now provide for the men liberal com
pensation and favorable working con
ditions. Moreover, the best obtain
able estimates indicate that to ac
cept your proposals would increase
the cost of operation or the railroads
approximately one hundred million
dollars a year, all or which must
eventually be borne by the public.
"We are conrident that you and
the men you represent appreciate the
responsibilities or this committee to
three substantial interests, viz:
1. (a) To the employes here In
volved whose efficient service Is ac
knowledged and with whom the rail
ways have no differences which can
not be considered fairly and decided
Justly by some Impartial body.
(b) To all other employes of the
railwaqs whose material welfare
should not suffer because of the pref
erment of any particular group of
fellow workers.
"2. To the owners of the railways,
who have a right to participate In the
earnings of their business on a fair
and equitable basis.
"3. To the public who are vitally
interested in the maintenance of an
uninterrupted and erriclent transpor
tation service, and whose ultimate
control or the situation we all recog
nize as fundamental.
"We reiterate the statement given
by the railways to their mep and re
peated to you by this committee, that
the railways have no desire to change
either the existing rates or pay or
working rules, nor to reduce the
earning possibilities or the employes
under their existing schedules; but
your proposals, in connection with
the Interpretations given during our
coherences, are so Inherently and
fundamentally oTirfysed to the views
of this committee, that we feel con
strained to decline and do hereby de
cline tbein.
DAY
"Our conferences have demonstra
ted that we cannot harmonize our
differences of opinion and that even-i

ferred to during our conferences as!

railways, viz:
"That in connection with and as a

CHANGED POLICE COURT
I'nsaiiitary Quarters in Basement of
City Hall 4 'au.se Itemoval to l'
Muir IUmiiii in Building
On account of the rather damp
condition of the basement of the city
hall, and its consequent effect on the
health of the police magistrate and
the attaches of his office, the police
court has been moved to the upper
floor of the building, in the room
formerly occupied as the council
chamber.
The ladies' ward of the city jail,
also located on the same floor, has
been remodeled and renovated.
After lhMze Distributor
The Alliance police are after the
scalps of parties who are making a
practice of procuring liquor for ha
bitual drunkards who have been
"barred" from buying It ror them
selves at the saloons. It is charged
that these men who aro unable to
purchase it rrom the saloons, are
rurnished with the liquor by parties
who buy it ror them. The saloon
men have been asked to co-operate
with the officials in stopping this
practice, which reriects on tho sa
loons themselves. Under Ihe Nebras
ka laws a saloon cannot sell liquor to
a person whose relatives or guardian
has notified the saloon not to sell
liquor to them.
PROHIBITION AS A
FORWARD MOVEMENT
l'aier Head by Mrs. Sadie 1). Npeix-r,
of Franklin, at Ihe Itecent State
I'. K. O. Convention In Alliance
(Contributed)
Public sentiment In regard to the
legalized liquor traffic has almost
entirely changed in the past ten
years, and In that time sixteen of the
states of the Union have been added
to the dry column. Ton years ago
only three states, Maine, Kansas and
North Dakota, were prohibition terri
tory. Today nineteen states boast of be
ing clean in this respect: - Georgia,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Washington, Ari
zona, Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Ida
ho, and South Carolina having climb
ed aboard the water wagon In the or
der given.
This fall the people of South Da
kota, California, Nebraska, Montana,
Michigan, Idaho, and Alaska will
vote on this Important question.
(Idaho's present law being only legis
lative, tho people of that state are
voting on the question as a constitu
tional amendment.)
The prohibition amendment will be
submitted to the Nebraska voters
November 7, at tho general election;
a petition, bearing over 70,000 signa
tures asking that the question be
submitted having been filed with the
secretary or state recently. The wo
men of the Rtate, whllo not allowed
to vote on the question, had a very
important part In securing this peti
tion ami seeing that it was circulated
over the state; nnd they can do still
more, by using their influence In so-
curing vo tea for the amendment.
Dry workers and even tho saloon In
terests aro confident that the amend
ment will carry this fall but herein
lies the greatest weakness in the
proposition ror the liquor Interests
are going to use every method of
trickery known to bring about Its
defeat and will spend ninny thous
ands of dollars to that end. On the
other hand, the dry forces are liable
to think the victory will be won
too easily and in this way bring
about its defeat by Indifference, and
failure to turn out to the polls on
election day.
The brewers are organized un ler
many high sounding names, Ihe Ne
braska branch being called tho Ne
braska Prosperity League. Other
favorite names areCharity Club,
Home Rule Iearue, Urape Growers'
Association, Business Men's League,
Tav Payers' Union, Alfalfa Growers'
Association, etc., etc. But you want
to beware of such high sounding
names. Brewers' Prosperity league
would come nearer being a true
name for such organizations.
Drunkenness wau given as the
cause for 54 per cent of the divorces
grained in Nebraska last year. Ne
braska's liquor bill cost the state
&75,2SS.56 in 1914, figuring half
the cost or the up-keep or the state
insane asylums, penitentiary, indus
trial homes, etc., which statistics go
to show gain hair their inmates
through the liquor traffic. This cost
is paid in taxes, and does not take
into account the hundreds of thous
ands or dollars paid out as a first cost
for liquor by the consumers, nor does
it lake into account the misery and
heartaches caused in homes where no
reports are ever made public.
Douglas, Hall, and Lancaster coun
ties send nearly half the dipsomani
acs to take the stale cure, their p r
cent being 27.4 per tent per 100,
000 population to 10.5 per cent ror
Ihe balance or the state. Those
three counties have most of the .a
lo jiirf Of the stale.
From an educational point or
view the report of the State Depart
ment of Education for 1914-15 shows
that the dry towns enroll a much
larger per cent of the pupils in the
high school than the wot towns do,
a list of Nebraska towns between
1.&00 and 4,000 population showing
that the dry town3 enrol! an aver
age of 262.6 per l,00i) of school pop
ulace r and the average attendance
is 22H.8 per 1,000, while on the e th
er hand, in the wet towns the enroll
ment is 122.3 per 1,000 school popu
lation and the average attendance is
only 102.6 per 1,000 an advantage
for the dry towns of over 100 per
cent.
We have been told that prohibi
tion will virtually confiscate the
property or the brewers and saloon
men, bt in states where prohibition
has taken effect lately the liquor
men are adapting themselves to the
changed conditions and are euterlng
legitimate business, others have
changed their plants Into milk prod
ucts plants, chemical and soap plants,
ice plants, yeast foctoiies, creamer
ies, paint, oil and varnish plants,
fruit by-products companies, and one
big brewery is bottling logan berry
Juice. Many saloon keepers are go
ing into business in the towns where
they formerly operated saloons are!
are selling their former customers
things to eat and wear Instead of
rirewater; and we believe that both
the customer and the former saloon
keeper get more satisfaction out of
their business dealings together.
So as P. E. O.'s, collectively and
individually, we owe It to our state
and to ourselves at this time to put
put out every effort for the amend
ment this election. Using a slang
phrase "It Is up to us."

EIGHT HOUR MOVEMENT
Art hie In IxtciHnotive KiurliM-r
Journal Given IIcamoiui fur
lgbl-llour Day
(By Brotherhoods Publicity Bureau)
The following article Is taken from
the Locomotive Engineers' Journal:
The men in train service must
have an eight-hour day because It la
Justly due them.
Eight hours of actual labor, the
preparatory time before and after the
service period to be additional, is all
the time the laborer can give ir he is
to secure the rest that nature de
mands and remain at his best.
Tills service period has been firm
ly established In the leading industri
al occupations and is commonly rec
ognized by law.
It enables the laborer to bo at his
best throughout the entire working
period and compensates for the loss
or time by the elimination or errors.
Errors in traffic movement are
more costly than errors In other oc
cupations. The errors of the over
worked employee create dangers for
others besides himself.
Tho eight-hour day should bo
granted for the benefit of the travel
ing public. The public pays for pas
sage on the trains. They have a
right to demand that the danger due
to overworking of employees be elim
inated. The passenger has a right to de
mand that passenger trains shall not
be handled over lines In constant
contact with freight trains wuoao
crews are overworked.
It should be granted because there
Is greater fatigue and less relaxation
In railway train service than In other
occupations.
The employees have irregular
hours. They know neither night nor
day. ir compelled to work at night
many men caunot sleep In daytime.
K their rooms are upon noisy streets
they get little rest.
They have no Sunday. "Thou
shalt do no labor on tho Sabbath day"
was not spoken of trainmen.
They must race all conditions of
weather. Rain, sleet, snow; In
storm or calm; freezing or burning,
they must go.
They cannot have regular meals,
and must often eat the lunch they
carry while on the run.
The operator and signalman,
hou.-ed and protected rrom the stress
or weather, whose business is mere
ly to write down upon paper or com
municate by signal what the train
men must do, are forbidden by law
to work more than elghl hours. . , ..
The man who does the work needs
rest sooner and needs it worse, and
needs it longer than the man who
tells him to do the work.
The eight-hour day should bo
granted because:
It will make the laborer a better
citizen. Belter citizens make better
nations and better governments.
Longer periods off duty bring tho
laborers into touch with the social,
moral and religious life of the com
munity. Their wants are Increased.
They are Inspired to greater effort.
They rise In the scale of human
worth. They become an asset to the
community.
More hours at ho ue make a man
ja better husband, a better father. He
will raise a better family.
Tho country may some day stand
the laborer or his sons In front or an
eneiay's guiF. may need them at
their best, ir It expects this. It must
avoid overwork.
Higher It ti.' Should lie Paid for Ov-
lime
li will induce the employer to hur
ry irai.n '. the road and ellmln
at. del.is.
Freight will be more promptly de
livered. This will benefit the public.
It will give grea er mileaee to en
gines and cars. This will benefit the
railroads.
It will enable the carriers to please
the public and eliminate much of the
worry incident to d. Iay -d .-hip ents.
It will be Justice to the railroads
that have already given the 12 Vg
miles an hour bans to their employ
ees. The demand should be granted be
cause: The increased compensation will
go to those most deserving it.
Increased tonnaue of trains has in
creased the labor and worry of the
trainmen. Their wages should In
crease In propor'ion to the Increatt
of their earnings for the employer.
The Operator Mind Wandered
An official In o ie of the Burling
ton railroad offices at Alliance, in go
ing over his usu I bunch of telo
grams for the dj y, was shocked to
find one that wet t like this: "Ger
many will make Poland a tree coun
try, Invade Eng'ard. tree Ireland,
teach all English speaking people to
speak German, pension Mutt aud
Jerr, dehorn all American born
steers and make the Alliance Herald
the official paper."
N Scale In Alliance Yards
The ulirlington has a force or men
installing a new car scale in the
yards at Alliance, south of the depot
and just north9 of the shops. These
t ales will have a capacity or 260,009
pounds and will take the place of the
scales formerly at the west end of
the yards.
