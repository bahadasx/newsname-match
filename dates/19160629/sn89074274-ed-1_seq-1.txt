Departure of First Regiment
Ft. Lincoln, N. D., June 27.—Adjutant
General Tharalson this afternoon re
ported to the war department that
the North Dakota guard is ready to
move to the border. The notification
to the war department doubtless will
be followed by immediate orders for
such movement of troops.
Ft. Lincoln, N. D., June 27. The
North Dakota guardsmen will be mov
ing toward the Mexican border within
the next 48 or 72 hours.
Orders issued today recalling re
cruiting details that remain at the sev
eral cities in which the militia com
panies have their homes the fact that
the adjutant general has received in
structions from the war department to
notify railroads of the routing lor the
troops, and the further fact that only
four days' rations have been provided
here, is regarded as conclusive evi
dence that the state militia will be
on its way to Mexico before many
hours have passed.
Among the guardsmen and the offi
cers, themselves, there is a feeling
that the orders to entrain for the bor
der may come before the close »f the
day. The feverish haste evidenced by
the war department in hurrying troops
from the east, southward, is regarded
as evidencing the intention to send
this state's contribution to the army,
to the border at once.
St. Louis is regarded as the point of
concentration for the North Dakota
National guard. If the prepared plan
of concentration is carried out, North
Dakota would there be brigaded with
the South Dakota regiment and an
Iowa regiment.
Late this afternoon, the adjutant
general will issue orders that will caN
ry several new appointments, most of
them of a minor nature.
No new men now being enlisted will
be equipped at this time, everything
that can be secured being needod for
the men now in training.

Overland N. D. Agency
Goes to Doyle Bros.
Fargo, June 27.—An important busi
ness change in automobile circles of
Fargo and the northwest in which
more"than $100,000 is reported to be
involved transpired this afternoon
when W. J. Doyle and S. J. Doyle of
Carrington, N. D., took over the con
tract for the distribution and sale of
Overland automobiles for the Fargo
territory. Announcement that the
deal was consummated came by long
distance telephone from United States
Marshal S. J. Doyle in St. Paul.
Doyle Brothers will come to Fargo
and open a large salesroom and trans
fer house in order to be in a position
to give the public the best possible
service in the territory which is cov
ered by their contract. The two men
who will enter the automobile busi
ness in this city need no introduction
to the people of Fargo nor the terri
tory surrounding, having been active
ly engaged in the machinery business
in North Dakota for the past 20 years.
W. J. Doyle came to this state in 1886,
and his brother S. J. Doyle in 1890.
W. J. Doyle was for many years gen
eral agent for the Deering Harvester
company at Grand Forks, also for the
Deere-Webber company before he mov
ed to Carrington to engage in the im
plement businesa and the livestock
business.
S. J. Doyle, the present United
States marshal, has been a resident of
North Dakota for 23 years and made
Fargo headquarters in the early days
when traveling for the McCormick
Harvester company. He moved to
Carrington in 1895 and engaged in the
implement and livestock business at
that point, later forming a partner
ship with his brother in their present
business under the firm name of the
Foster County Implement company,
which is one of the largest retail es
tablishments in the state of North Da

DEATH OF PROMINENT
WOMAN AT NOME
The death of Mrs. Sigurd Thompson,
the wife of a well known resident of
Nome, occurred Monday morning. On
arising Mr. Thompson became aware
that she was missing from the home,
and a search was made immediately.
Later the body was found in a slough
about a mile from town. Mrs. Thomp
son had not been in good health for
some time, and her death is attributed
to her continued illness. Before her
marriage Mrs. Thompson will he re
membered as Miss Palma Bronson,
who at one time attended the Normal
school here. Besides her husband, she
leaves three children to mourn her
death. The funeral was expected to be
held Tuesday.

Chautauqua Session
GAMBLING DEVICES SEIZED
Bismarck, June 27.—Sheriff Heath,
under the leadership of H. A. Hanson,
states attorney of Burke county, and
on the complaint of Superintendent
Watkins of the N. D. Enforcement
League, seized valuable property of
the Hines-Cash Carnival company
June 24 and put in jail the party oper
ating the same.
Assistant Supt. C. W. Finwall had
seized gambling devices of this
company and warned them but they
evidently did not expect to be fol
lowed. They will now get the limit
the law allows if league officers have
their way, and next time this company
violates the law they will be handled
under the nuisance act which is espec
ially severe, and will enjoin the show
throughout the entire state.
The league men are determined to
seize all such gambling devices, and
prosecute all violators of the gambling
laws carried on at fairs and by shows
and carnival companies.
Some interesting developments are
promised relative to the official side
of the case as concessions must be
allowed for such performance, and
it is believed the governor should re
move on proper complaint officers al
lowing such open gambling.
Old Settlers Day Big
Event at Chautauqua
Wednesday, July 12, is Old Settlers'
at the Valley City Chautauqua. The
board of directors, President Sim Ma
son and Secretary I. J. Moe are plan
ning to make this the big day of the
year. The best musical event of the
session will be on that day and a
speaker of national reputation will
talk to the pioneers, but we are not
permitted to announce his name yet.
We want every old settler, his wife,
his children and all their friends to
come for this event. One half of the
gate receipts of that day will go to
the Monument fund, so by attending
you will help swell the fund for this
good work. We propose to erect a
monument in honor of the pioneers of
Dakota territory who with their pluck
and work changed the Great Ameri
can Desert into the bread basket of
the world. The Barnes County Pio
neer club urges every citizen of the
county to come and take in the Old
Settlers' Day at the Valley City Chau
tauqua. By doing so you will make it
possible for the association to erect a
suitable monument in honor of our
pioneers.
FARMERS DO GOOD WORK.
Fingal Herald: During the last
week N. P. Langemo, H. T. Lee and
John Nelson have done a nice neat job
of dragging seven miles of road west
of town. The wet weather and heavy
loads put the roads in a rough condi
tion, and the recent effect on the part
of the enterprising farmers in com
mendable.
The Misses Edna and Amy Even
son left on Saturday morning for
Kathryn and Marion, to spend a week
visiting with relatives and friends.
Nursery's. Berry Field
WU1 Yield Much Fruit
The Northwest Nursery has in ten
acres of strawberries, about half of
them being the Progressive Everbear
ing. This is a variety put on the mar
ket within a couple of years and yields
berries from early in the season until
the ground freezes in the fall. The
product of this ten acres is expected
to reach about 1,000 crates, which will
be put on the local market.
A large number of plants of this
variety have been sold this year, oth
erwise the product of the field would
have gone much higher than the fig
ures quoted above.
ESTABLISHED life
From every hand come most en
couraging reports of a prospective
record attendance at the coming
Chautauqua session, which opens Fri
day.
Committees were out Tuesday and
canvassed the city thoroughly for
ticket sales. Their reports are opti
mistic to a high degree, they stating
that people are buying season tickets
who never bought before, showing the
feeling that the Chautauqua as a home
institution is worthy of patronage.
In addition to this the boosters who
have been making auto trips around
the county have met with a cordial re
ception. Six parties were out Tues
day, visiting Sanborn, Eckelson, Wim
bledon, Leal, Rogers and Dazey. Wim
bledon takes kindly to the Spiritwood
encampment, it being so close to
them, but the hustling little city in the
northwest corner of the county will
still be well represented here. In the
other places everything points to a
big attendance for the Valley City en
campment. The business men realize
the educational value of this work to
the county and are willing to do their
share toward its support.
Wednesday other parties were out
both south and north and unless rain
prevents practically every part of the
county will be covered by Friday.
Another encouraging feature is the
fact that former occupants of tent
sites who had not intended to come
this summer have just recently made
reservations, some of them using the
phone in order to be sure to get in in
time.
Taking everything into consideration,
the outlook this year is better than
ever before. It is true that weather
conditions are not propitious, but with
that exception there is every reason
to look for a big attendance and a
most successful season. The programs
are really worth while and it will rest
with the citizens of the county to
make the right kind of use of them.
The officers and committees have
just about all that human foresight
and energy can do, but they will not
let up while there is still chance to
put in another lick for success this
year.
A feature that is going to be a big
help is Old Settlers' Day on July 12.
Some of the old settlers, like Mayor
Moe, are not so old yet, and they
Moe, are not as old yet, and they
have several bags of tricks to be
emptied before they concede that they
have got everybody who ought to be
here that day. And all of this is good
advertising for the institution, the
kind of advertising that will bring big
results in future years.
Those who have not yet purchased
tickets may secure them at any of
the banks, or from Herman Stern,
chairman of the ticket committee, at
the Straus Clothing Co.

one of the authorities of this country
on cattle and dairying, it will be one
of the features of the session. Val

him to secure the attendance of the
big men of the nation.

The Nonpartisan league special

From here the train proceeded to

was terminated.
Those connected with the league
