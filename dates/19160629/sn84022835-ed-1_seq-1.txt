When You Write A Check
You write your own receipt at the same time, because
the payee cannot tfet the money until he has written
his name across the back of your check, and the check
is returned to you by the bank after being paid.
This is one of the many advantages of having a bank
account in this strong bank, and our service costs you
nothing. We do all the bookkeeping and furnish every
thingall you have to do is to deposit your money, pay
your bill by check and we render an accounting as
often as you please. ,
If you call upon us, we shall be glad to talk the mat
ter over with you and show you why a connection with
this bank will prove advantageous to you.
Deposits in this Hank are protected by the Depositors'
Guarantee Fund of the State of Nebraska.
