VOLUME 36. No. 14
AN ENVIABLE
REPUTATION
J^ORTH DA-
kota as a state
has the reputa­
tion of being the
Bread Basket of
the World. With
this notority also
comes undesira­
ble "beings who
are looking for
money and valu­
ables without
working for them.
PROTECT your
property and
business by burn­
ing a NIGHT
LIGHT. Dark­
ness invites crime
but light dispoils
the thought of
theft. You can
burn a 40 watt
Mazda lamp for
25 hours for the
price of a kilo­
watt, or about 1-2
cent per hour.
Can you afford
to run the risk in
having your
place of business
without this pro­
tection? Call
your local man­
ager for estimate
if you have not
already the prop­
er instillation.

Heat and Horses
Sunstroke is cavsed by direct rays
of the sun falling upon the skull. A
horse so allected may die suddenly as
though stricken with apoplexy or he
may have a gradual paralysis of res
piration. The symptoms which usual
ly present themselves are restlessness,
pawing, spasms and a marked redness
of the mucous membranes lining the
cavities of the head. The tempera
ture in sunstroke may not rise above
normal during the whole course of
the disease.
Another condition very similar to
sunstroke is that known as heatstroke
or heat exhaustion. This is brought
about by over exertion and insuffi
cient, heat elimination. The direct
rays of the sun are not responsible
for this affection which very aften oc
curs to an animal ou a cloudy, sultry
day. Some of the more prominent
symptoms of heat stroke are weari
ness, profuse sweating, difficult
breathing, an extremely high temper
ature, and a rapid pulse, which grad
ually grows weaker and upon the ap
proach of death muscular tremors will
be noted. The treatment for sun
stroke and heat stroke are the same.
Remove the animal to a cool, quiet,
well ventilated place and permit a
stream of cold water to flow over the
horse and if possible apply ice packs
to the head. If ice is plentiful apply
it all over the body.

HAPPY THOUGHT.
"Young Cholly Sappington is not BO
stupid as I thought him."
"What caused you to change your
opinion?"
"His behavior when my motor car
broke down twenty miles from the
city."
"You don't mean to say he could
do anything to help?"
"Oh, yes. He strolled with the la
dies of the party to a spring nearby
and gave me a chance to do a little
plain and fancy swearing."
In the Sanctum.
"Ex-Congressman Flubdub wants a
little writeup," remarked the maga
zine publisher. "What shall wo say
about him?"
"What did he ever do?"
"Nothing."
"Say he upheld the best traditions
of congress. That means little, for or
against."

A
Built for the
Business Farmer
The Dort was built for the business
farmer. For 30 years Dort had been
building farm vehicles. He knew what
the farmer wanted for vehicles and
what he needed in an automobile.
If an automobile is going to be a business
asset to the farmer he must be able to
use it every day in the year when the
roads are deep with snow when the tem
perature is far below zero and again in
the spring when the frost is coming out of theground
and the mud is so deep and thick that the average
car will sink to the hubs and be hopelessly mired.
The Dort is built for these conditions. It is a real
farmer's automobile. The price, $665, puts it with
in the reach of every business farmer. Its light
weight insures low cost of operation.
From every standpoint of mechanical excellence
and appearance the Dort merits a careful investi
gation of the Business Farmer.
