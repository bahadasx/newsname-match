sugar factory, and its probable site is
four miles north of Arco. Its likely lo

a factory. We have been informed that [
tlu* Utah Construction Company, which |

are the men who are boosting for the

that if the factory is established there

AN UNAUTHENTICATED ROBBERY
Few Blackfoot Volun
teers for Mexico Servict
Lust Sunday evening a large mass
meeting was held in the Orpheum The
Hire for the purpose of inducing re
cruits to enlist in the Second Idaho In
........ .... XT .. , i . . . . 1
fan try ot the National Guard, which is
short of men. j
The meeting was called to order by
hiii-ch
*
Rev. Austin, of the Hnptist
who is also acting as recruiting officer
upon the rerpiest of Governor Alexan
der. The Woodman band volunteered
their services for the occasion, and the
Orpheum Theatre was also a gratis
contribution. The meeting was called
to order bv the recruiting officer, and
Rev. Strom<|uist invoked the divine
blessing. The Rev. Barnstable made a
few brief and pertinent remarks, and
Col. McCall, a recruiting missionary,!
imparted some military information and
solicited and answered many ipiestions '
concerning enlistment, and stated that
he would remain after the meeting and
receive the names of those wishing to
enlist. Although the meeting whs
■argel.v attended, principally by women f
a,l, l g'rl*. there was a lack of inter
•***♦• M,l| l even enthusiasm was not very
noticeable. While all seemed to be
anti-Mexican, they were not very war
like, and none were willing to leave
their happy homes and rally round the ,
ling in the land of the Greaser and the
actus. While tliei
patriotism among our people, or any
friendship for our Mexican neighbors,
they are attempting to harbor a hope
that a cruel war is not inevitable, for
they seem to think that war is hell, win
or lose. Occasionally we hear the dec
la ration that "If I was not too old, or
or my son was not too young, we would
lose no time in getting to the front.."
Rev. Austin is a fair sample of the hon
est. conscientious, patriotic citizen, and
he is credited with saving that he is
is not a lack ot
«•Hlii.g to accommodate the governor by
rccemng tin* names ot volunteer ve
eruits, Vmt Hint lie will not use liis in
flucnce to eonvert any young man to be
come a soldier.
As far as we are able to learn, no
Blackfoot boy lias yet enlisted, and we
know of none contemplating doing so.
Col. Jack Henderson, .of Arco, has gone
to Boise to ioin his company, and to
morrow W. 0. Allen, who is well known
in Blackfoot and a member of an 111 i
nois military company, left for Boise
to enlist. Jess Waddell, who is a mem
ber of Company H of the Boise Home
Guards, went to Boise last Tuesday to
investigate the chances of going to
the Mexican border. Tic spent several
days in camp with
his company, and has
ret the consent of hi

J mother before he can enlist
and desert her for servi* n in the army, j

MOTOR BIKERS IN BLACK
FOOT RACE JULY 2
Valuable arizes will be offered for the
winners in tho annual motorcycle endur
ance race which will be run to Black
foot, .Inly 2. The Blackfoot Auto club,
under whose direction the race will be
run, has raised about. $1066 for the
rond race und the other events, which
will la 1 held daring the Independence
day celebration.
D. A- Jenkins, who was in town Fri
day, gave out some of the plans which
Mark Farmer, the director of the event,
has ninde. Three prizes will he award
ed—$166 for first place. $66 for ......aid
j aad 040 f„ r third. ■ In addition to this,
the expenses of the riders will lie paid
1 while they are in Blackfoot and a sup
per will lie held in their honor.
The race will lie free for all. No
brand of machine will be barred, and
any rider may enter. The contest will
be an endurance race, «-»in a set tiimi
between each town, but tin 1 require!!
time will be made fast enough to keep
the riib rs extending their machines tho
entire distance. The time last year
over the course was s hours 17 minutes.
The officials hope to cover it this year
in slightly more than six houis.
I ast year the riders met with much
difficulty along the roads, and the time
was probably lower on that account
tlui" it would have been with clear
roads. Moreover, many of the riders
■were injured owing to collisions with
wagons and cuttle at various points.
The officials arc taking every precmi
tion this year to remedy this situation,
Arrangements have already been i-fiin
pleted with the Idaho towns to guard
the highway, mid the I'tali towns liavo
shown a willingness do likewise,
An automobile will probably go ahead
of the riders on the Utah part of tho
road, where the traffic is heavy, as a
further safeguard.
The complete list of riders ims not
vet been made oat. but some of th«
prominent motorcyclists who will fnk«
part are Ray Peek, Don Binitli, Rink
Simirtliwnite, AI Ward, Roy Farrow,
Harry 'Cooper, mid probably Lon (.'Inf
lin.
The course starts at Salt Lake nml
passes through the following towns:
Ogden. Brigham, Honey ville, Dewey*
