department early tod&y froto Special
Agent Rodgers at Mexico City. When
he sent tho word last night Mr.

Mfttfasei&tofr hia^ attitude toward the
AAiericati expedition in Mexico to
protect the border, however, the. crisis
Is only less Imminent than It Was.
High officials of the administration
let it be known that the United States
would go on with its military opera'
tion to safeguard its citizens and ter
ritory and would keep on pursuing
bandits in Mexico when there was
hope of overtaking them.
Official Word of Release.'
Secretary Baker carried to the
"White House early today a copy of
Consul Garcia's message to General
Bell at El Paso saying that the" men
were en route to the border last night.
Soon after this came the message
from Mr. Rodgers. Mr. Arredondo,
Mexican ambassador designate, was
advised by the foreign minister,
Aguilar, in Mexico City, of his gov
ernment's action.
RelMsfc of the prisoners had no
effect,^ nowever, on efforts to speed up
the mobilization of .the national
guards along the border and to furnish
,an adequate supply of war materials
to meet the emergency.
p^j To Keep Guards in Service.
iSi? Even should the Mexican reply dis
claim any hostile intention and with
draw orders, to Carranza commanders
offensive .to the United States, the
patrol would be keep up at the
strength now contemplated while any
danger from bandits kept on. To free
itself from the menace of an army
mobilized on its north frontier, the
Mexican government must comply
also with the,demands that it police
adequately its' border stations and
establish, such firm military control
there that raiding in the United States
is improbable and the assemblage of
any large group of bandits impossible.
Didn't Plan to Hold Them.
Mr. Arredondo today IsStied this
official statement understood to
based on the langiiage of his message
from the, City of Mexico:
"I have been confident from the
first that \ff American soldiers would
be set fre Prom the time of their
capture un'tll arrangements were made
to free them there was at no time any
other intention by the de facto gov
ernment or Its officials. The 'attitud^
of the first chief has beeti one always^
of friendship to the United States,
promoted always by a desire to avoid
conflict and promote the welfare of
the two governments. In the sltua
tion as It exists it should be borne in
mind that it has not been brought
about by any act which could be at
tributed either to the government or
•the Mexican people, but is due entirelf
to the pre determined intentions of an
irresponsible criminal."
Explains Release of IM*n.
In announcing he had been told by
his flrovernment foreign office of the
order for the release* of the prisoners
jfr. Arredondo said his information
was that Carranza had taken the step
^because he did not want to aggra
vate the relations between the two
countries."
Escorts For D*ad Troopers.
A resolution to provide for military
escorts for "thp bodies of troopers of the
Tenth United States (fAvalry killed In

Preparations For War Continue to Be
Made by Funaton.
San Antonio, June \29.—Staff officers
and department chiefs at1 General
Funston's headquarters began today
the work of shafting the hourly in
creasing army for an offensive move.
^Notice that Carranza had ordered
the surrender of the troopers taken
at Carrizal did not lower the pressure
of preparation. The opinion was cur
rent that the release of the
.prisoners
had not altered the reasons for
mobilization of an army along the
border.
By night it Wat believed that con
siderable of the newly made army
would be nearing .border stations.
Supplies- were being assembled at
Brownsville, Laredo, Eagle Pass and
other points where the great concen
tration will be made.
.The purchasing- of horses and mules
was under, \vay today under the first
contract ratified yesterday by the war
department. Buyers declared that
the grade of animals' being bought was
slightly better than European buyers
had been getting. Reports from border
commanders said no clash of any con
sequence had taken place. The slight
exchange of shots between out-posts
near Brownsville was not regarded as
serious. Carranza troops continued
their mobilizing south of Matamoras
and' other points along the paralleling
borders.

to the American authorities.
A shout of laughter rose from thou
sands of Juarez Mexicans who had
gathered to see the arrival, as the
negroes -filed from the train. They
•were dressed in« scanty and nonde
script attire. Some had only trousers.
One wore a shirt, while a towel en
circled his waist. Others' heads were
decorated with bandanas.

"Spillsbury was not so uncommuni
cative, however.
He went into Gonzales' office and
gave out an interview in which he re
peated statements he had made at Chi

statements were to the effect that
Captain Boyd, commander of the Am
ericans at Carrizal, persisted in going
on towards Villa Ahumada to recover
a negro deserter after General Gomez
had warned him to turn back and after
Spillsbury had urged him to accept
this advice.
This interview was arranged at the
solicitation of the iMexican officials
and before Spillsbury or any of the
Americans had had a chance to see the
American officials.

He said after the second conference
between Boyd' and General Gomez,
when he advised -turning back. Cap

"I am the commander and it Is for
you to obey."

CASEMENT TO
BE SHOT FOR
Leader of Sinn Fein Revolt
Speedily Found Guilty
by Jury.
PRISONER SMILES
AT DEATH VERDICT
Greets Friends Pleasantly and Makes
Statement in Court—Chief Justice
Deolares Treason During State of
War I* Unpardonable Crime—At
torney Sullivan, Who Collapsed in
Court Wednesday, Unable to Appear.
London, June 29.—Sir Roger Case
ment, alleged leader of the Sinn Fein
revolt in Ireland, was found guilty of
high treason by a jury^ today and sen
tenced to be shot. After he had beer,
sentenced Daniel J. Bailey, the private
soldier who had been held as his ac
complice, was placed in the dock. The
ychief
justice' told the jury to return a
verdict of not guilty and Bailey was
discharged.
After the verdict had been returned
Sir Roger began to read a very long
statement.
Sir Roger received the sentence with
the utmost composure, smiling at
friends in the room. His statement,
which occupied a half hour, was a plea
for the right to be tried by Irishmen
and for Irish nationality.
Sullivan Still III.
Mr. Sullivan, the Irish barrister upot.
whom has rested the burden of the
defense^Hsf Sir Roger, was unable to
appear todky to finish his argument in
"behalf 6f"Sir Rdger.*"'He collapsed un-'
der the strain and emotion while giving
an impassioned speech in court last
night.
Artemas Jones, assistant counsel,
addressed the court. He admitted that
at first thought it seemed an outrage
for Sir Roger to go to Germany, but
he insisted that the defendant had
tried merely to organize an Irish bri
gade for use against the Ulster volun
teers recruited by Sir Edward Carson.
He contended that the work Sir Roger
did in Germany was the same sort of
work he did in Ireland before the war.
Mr. Jones' speech took more than
half an ho.ur, after which the attorney
general, Sir Frederick Smith, summed
up. He argued that In days before
the war Sir Roger's defense might have
had some weight but "one circum
stance not Insignificant had intervened
—the greatest military power the world
had ever seen was trying to destroy the
British empire." The attorney general's
speech took an hour.
Jury Out Short Time.
Then the chief justice began his
charge to the Jury.
"Treason in time of war when ail
persons are making sacrifices to defeat
the enemy is almost too grave for ex
pression,' the chief justice said. "You
must dismiss from your minds all yoy
have heard or read outside this court.
We have heard mlich about politics
in Ireland. For myself, in the court of
justice I always feel anxiety when poli
tical passion is aroused. Pay no at
tention to what has been said about
conditions in Ireland before the war, or
after all, to consider the conditions of
this case.'
After outlining the law of treason he
pointed uul the facts the case were
undisputed.
The jury went out at 2:55.
Appeal to Be Taken.
Viscount Reading, lord chief justice
of England, with black cloth, by tra
dition called a cap, spread over his
head, and his two associates in scarlet
gowns, likewise black capped, pro
nounced the sentence of death for high
treason on Sir Roger Casement shortly
before 5 o'clock thts afternoon, half an
hou[ after the foreman of the jury. In
a shaking voice, gave the verdict. An
appeal will be taken.
Sir Roger addressed the court, read
ing his final statement with the ex
planation that he wanted It to reach a
much larger audience ana particularly
the people of America, from whom had
come many messages of sympathy to
him and whose own struggle for liberty,
he said, always had been an inspiration
to Irishmen.
"Not Tried by Peer*."
Sir Roger's auditors, among whom
were Viscount Bryce and many other
noted men and women, listened in si
lence, some moved to tears.
The prisoner said he did not regard
trial by Englishmen In an English
court as a trial by his peers, to which
he was entitled. He reviewed recent
events in Ireland from the beginning
of the formation of the Ulster volun
teers, and said:
"We have aeen tne constitutional
army refuse to obey the constitutional
government and we were told the first
duty of Irishmen was to enter that
army. Small nations were to be the
first consideration. I saw no reason
why Ireland should shed any blood for
any people but her own.
"If that Is treason am not ashamed
to avow it here. if me Unionists
showed the road they thought would
lead to the good side, I knew my road
Jed to the dark side. Both of us proved
right. So I am prouder to stand hare

LIEBKNECHT TO PRISON.
German Sooialiat Sentenced to Thirty
Months For Treason.
Berlin, June 29. Dr. Karl Lleb
knecht, the socialist leader, was sen
tenced to thirty months' penal servi
tude and dismissed from the army for
attempted high treasrfn, gross insub
ordination, and resistance to fhe au
thorities.
The court decided that Dr. Lleb
knecht was guided by political fanatic
ism. and not by unpatriotic feeling, and
therefore imposed the lowest penalty
on him. The maximum penalty would
have been fifteen years. Dr. Llebknecht
is entitled to appeal from the sentence.
The trial was held behind closed
doors. When the court martial con
vened there wa» a large attendance of
persons Interested In the casi\ but the
room was almost immediately clearer
while the court considered a motion
made by the prosecutor to exclude the
public during the entire trial "In the
Interest of public security." This mo

also that newspapers should print no
reports of the trial except the verdict,
which would be made public.
