grateful for this demonstation of the

Harvest About Over
Nearly all the wheat and much of
the oats in this section have been cut
It did seem two weeks ago that wet
fields and continued rain would cause
much damage and expense bu t a weeks
sunshine and breezes changed the sit
nation quickly The wheat is very
thin at bast this year but the oats are
exceptionally good and with harvest
out of the way farmers can get right
into the corn mod of which is In very
good condition

COUNTY BONDS FOR ROADS
Distributes the Expense Equit
ably and Provides Permanent
Roads in Shortest Time
The following article on the proposi
tion of a county bond issue for the
building of public highways was writ
ten for The News by EV Scott at the
request of the publisher hereof We
commend the article to the attention
particularly of our Jasper County read
ers because we believe this to be the
quickest surest and most equitable
way to build an adequate county wide
system of public highways The arti
cle follows
K vcryone concedes that hard surface
roads are a desirable improvement
However to place the burden of road
building in our rural communities
wholly upon the farmer because he
reaps the greatest material benefit
while possibly equitable is neither
practicable nor promising
According to the reports of the De
partment of Agriculture road improve
ment has invariably increased land val
ues from two to nine dollars per acre
depending upon the location and the
nature of the improvement An in
crease in value of farm lands will also
be a benefit to the cities of the county
A iitw day road would be a souice of
infinite Katisfaetion to every motor ow
ner of the city and the farmer who
owns a carand lives on that road would
come to the city three times where he
now comes once
We believe that it would be to the
interest of the cities to join hands with
us and unite upon some practical and
comprehensive plan of road construc
tion
Only three counties in this state pos
sess greater wealth than Jasper county
They are Buchanan Jackson and St
Louis counties
The assessed valuation of our county
is approximately 10000000 Next
comes Greene County with 22000000
valuation then they drop down to 13
millions and below
The assessed valuation of the farm
lands together with the personal piop
erty of the farmers of Jasper County
amounts to about 10000000 Since
the farmer possesses one third the as-
sthved valuation of the county it neces
sarily follows that he pays just one-
third the tax budget of the county
Therefore any additional tax levy or
bond issue for public improvements
such as hard surface roads would be
riNed in the proportion of two dollars
from the cities and corporations to every
one dollar from the farmer
Should not we farmers be willing to
give one dollar for two when the three
dollars will be spent alongside our
farms
With the exception of thofuurrout -ties
mentioned above in 110 other coun
ty of the state are the farmers so for
tunately situated in this respect as in
Jasper County
The assessed valuation of Barton
County WW is G22702 the farm
lands and personal property of the
farmers of Barton County are assessed
in round numbers at 5010000
So you observe the Barton County
farmer pays nearly five sixths the tax
bill of the County Tnko Bates Coun
tythe valuation of whiehis 11000000

Eighteenth Year No 44
A Mistaken Idea
Quite a good many well meaning
people Bcem to have the Idea that when
a newspaper continues going to a sub
scriber after the time paid for has
elapsed that the subscriber is under no
obligation to pay for it and that some
Iowor other protects him Itural news
paper men the country over would
probably welcome such a law II would
simplify matters very much and do
away with a lot of inconvenience loss
of money and ill feeling
Some of these days the country press
will have to adopt the plan of stopping
the paper when the lime is out though
very few of them have had the courage
to do so up to this time The pub
lisher of this paper knows of only one
country paper that advertises to that
effect and that paper is the Greenfield
Vedette
The reason the rural press has not
adopted this plan is because four flths
of the readers of the country paper re
side in a radius of u few miles of the
ofllce in which it is printed and the
publisher thereof knows them nearly
ull personally and publisher and read
ers meet each other two or three times
a month on the average Nowitscems
that the most natural and honest and
frank thing to do if a man dont care
for the paper any longer would be to
pay for the time and tell the publisher
to slop it orevenphone in and tell Mm
If the paper is continued after the sub
scriber has so notified the ofllce thqn
the subscriber has done his part if he
is paid up to that time We never send
the paper to anyone whom we have any
reason to believe does not want it and
moreover when a subscriber says stop
the paper when the time is out we
write the word stop on his card in our
index system and c stop the paper
when the time expires but if it is over
looked and the paper continues going
to him for a time we do not expect to
collect for that time
