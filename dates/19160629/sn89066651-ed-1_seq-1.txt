is not only necessary but is V he
duty of thosu who can to licl)

When duty calls, and America's
son answers that call, leaving his

every citizen should not falter in
helping to provide for his family.
The chance the soldier is tailing
lor your benefit should be ol
some weight lo you.
Therefore it may be under

lamihes in this count who arc in
need of help, let it 'c Itnown or
report such fact to the Herald
and wo will do all in our power
to call attention lor help for the

when appeals, of this kind are
heard.

It has no doubt been apparent to you
for more than a year past that the price
of all articles of merchandis.e through
this country has had a rising tendency. It
is unnecessary to search for the reason
why this is true, or to attempt to specu
late upon how long such a condition may
last. The fact is that costs in the great
basic industries of manufacture have had
an almost startling rise. This has per
haps been more apparent in the leather
and shoe trades than in any other line.
More than a fourth of the leather used in
the manufacture of median price and
cheap shoes has gone abroad and costs
have advanced from 90 per cent to 100
per cent. Our Company are large pur
chasers of leather, large manufacturers,
mid can and will maintain our unheard
of low prices. Come and investigate.
Look for more leather news next week.

Will Bore for Oil.
M. G. Tcmole of Capo Girar
deau, accompanied by a party of
capitalists of St. Louis was in
this city last Saturday and again
Wednesday.
They have at present, wo un
derstand, taken leases on not
less than 11,000 acres of the best
larm land nrar Hayti, and are
going to bore lor oil.
Several of our business men
have taken stock in the company,
which will be mentioned later,
as developments may appear,
and much active comment is
made. The company has entered
into a contract with one of our
largest farmers for the sinking
ol a well at least!!, 200 feet or less
il oil is struck, and in case no oil
is struck, the casing is to be left.
The company is under con
tract to have machinery on the
ground and begin drilling within
six months.
At several times past, while
driving pumps in this city, pock
ets of gas have been struck,
which is a pretty good indication
that oil can certainly be found in
this vicinity in paying quantities.
Howover, it is hoped that all talk
is not in vain, but may be one ol
realization.
The company interested is one
that is amply able to carry out
any work started, and we will
give details as they develop.

loure arrived this morning from
home with 19 new recruits too
late for breakfast. The now re
cruits ate a small lunch, but
said nothing, evidently surprised
at the tunt city. They spent
most of the time looking at the
tents, which was quite a sight
for them. It is estimated there
arc at least s)U.J2 encamped
here. There is but very little
sickness in our company, and
the boys are seeming to be in
the best of spirits, that is, until
the big papers came announcing
orders soon to move. However,
at present, we have received no
orders to pack and go. The
First Regiment has been mus
tered in, all men taking the vac
cination. Our regiment, the
Fourth, comes next, which will
require some timo to complete
the examination; but in a few

be ready for action if called out.

That Light Franchise.
rast week we had occasion to
speak about the light service in
this city, that is, the day ser
vice. Since, wo understand, the
county court has given the com
pany a franchise over the county
road and that everything is in
readiness to give Hayti day ser
vici'. Mr. Cooley of Blytheville, one
of the owners of the company,
we understand is in Boston,
Mass., this week, going for the
purpose of obtaining permission
of the head office for buying the
necessary material for running
tlio line from Caruthcrsville to
this city.
It will be welcomed on the part
of the light consumers of Hayti,
and it is hoped that the time may
be short until we have it.
In the near future an article
will be prepared showing the
many needs of this day and night
service.
John Nunn, one of the pro
gressive farmers of the Poust

Monday and brought a cotton

Get in the Game
Let everybody get busy, and with
everyone in the game, things will hum.
With everybody doing his best, busi
ness will pick up, the town will boom,
and everything will come out for the
best.
We know that it has been raining,
but the showers are about over. Let
the farmers get in the game with their
teams, plows and hoes, clean out their
crops as well as they can and be ready
to take advantage of the coming high
prices.
Although prices are likely to go still higher, both in
favor of the farmer and against him, still, as long as we re
main in the game, those trading here will be protected
against too high prices and inferior goods,
