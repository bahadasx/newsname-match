South, American officials brought to
the attention of the administration to

lieved will eventually lead to a seri

Latin countries cannot conceive ol a
war between Mexico and the United
States. Those interested in the Pan
Ameracan movement regard the pres-
nt crisis as a vital test of principles.
They regard strife between Ameri
can nations virtually as a civil war.
They point out that every treaty ne
gotiated between European powers
has fallen. With the remainder of
the world divided, they contend that
the Americas must Join their interests
diplomatically, commercially and in-
dustriallv. They point out that most
tional police. Those behind the move-
ment see the possibility of testing this
theory. A successful pacification of
stricken Mexico would have a great
influence in Europe toward proving
the practicability of an International
police. The Latins do not regard that
Mexican responsibility for the Carri
xal clash has been proved.

An ordinance, making a disorderly

closely the state law but is adapted
to municipal procedure.
It provides that anyone who "erects,

place in which any immoral acts are
Permitted shall be guilty of maintain-(
ing a nuisance. It provides that after !
