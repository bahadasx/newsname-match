APPLE BONS
NEW PRODUCT
NEWCONTECnONS WIN RECOGNITION
Method Result From Experiments in
Making Christmas Sweets Year
Before Last
Trivial and seemingly inconsequen
tial incidents may be tbe beginning of
great industries. Today tbe new fac
tory of the Fancy Fruit Products Co.,
just erected here for tbe manufacture
of a special confection, soda fountain
syrup and apple butter, is a proof of
tbe foregoing aphorism.
Just before Christmas of year before
last Randall 3. Pratt, now manager of
the plant, wss assisting bis mother,
Mrs. D. L. Pratt, of Wenatchee, Wn.,
to make sweets for the approaching
holiday feasts. Mr. Pratt's father is
owner of orchards in the Wenatchee
district, and, as is the ease in all orch
ards, a small percentage of the fruit
was not marketed because of some ex
terior, minor defect. Young Mr. Pratt
and his mother tried some experients
with these cull apples. The excellency
of the candied fruit resulting gave tbe
young man, then a student specializing
in chemistry at the University of
Washington, his big idea. Putting to
the test bis scientific learning and the
information gathered from the practic
al lessons in his mother's kitchen, Mr.
Pratt baa perfected a process for the
making of appla confections. His prod
uct has won recognition wherever dis
played. Apple Bons is the name'applied'to
the new product. Although a Yellow
Newtown or a Spitsenburg may be oth
erwise perfect, if it have a compara
tively small limb rub, a scar caused
from the burn of some spray or the ac
tion of the sun's rsys, it cannot be
marketed in the commercial trades
recognizedjby Northwestern fruit sales
agencies. The defect does not keep it
from becoming an extra fancy Apple
Bon. Thus Mr. Pratt began his task
of finding the right process to convert
imperfect apples into candy, Impelled
not only by dreams of possible future
profit for himself, but that profitable
returns might be realised by growers
for this class of fruit.
After satisfying himself that he had
found the right process for the manu
facture of his new confection, Mr.
Pratt succeeded in interesting VL A.
Schanffer and A. F. Adams in his prop
osttion, and the construction of the
new factory, 30x60 feet, soon followed.
Tbe factory of the Fancy Fruit Prod
ucts Co. adjoins the steam laundry
building, from the boilers of which are
secured the steam for cooking the con
fections. At present tbe new process
is only being applied to apples, which
at this season of theear are for tbe
most part being made into a delicious
shredded product for ;the garnishment
of ice cream sundaes. During the
cooler seasons the plant will turn out
tbe candied fruit.
In appearance the new candied ap
ples, which may be given any fruit fla
vor and made any color, remsemble
fruit pastes that have long been on the
market. The apples may be preserved
whole or sliced. After tbey are cured
they may be given a coating of cream
or chocolate.
The new company's apple butter is
really a by-product of the candies and
fountain syrups. Some of the apples
in tbe application of the terrific heat
to which they are put come to pieces.
These smaller bits are destined to fill
butter jars.
Although the new factory has been
opened but a few weeks, it has already
received enough orders to keep the
plant busy throughout the season.
Later other varieties of iruits win oe
turned into tasteful confections by the
new process. -
RICHARD HUNT TELLS
OF BORDER FIGHTS
Richard Hunt, son of R. M. Hunt,
custodian of the court house grounds
and himself a veteran of the Civil war,
has recently written his father of some
of the incidents of present border war
fare. In tbe letter to bis father young
Mr. Hunt, a member of an artillery
regiment, says:
"just received your letter.the dooks,
magasines, stationery, etc. 1 cannot
tell you how much I appreciate them.
We haven't very much to do down
here except to drill in the hot sunshine
and sand storms. This is a duece of a
war. - On our way down, sure did hike
some, in six days we traveled iw
miles. We each received a pint of wa
ter a day, and believe mo we were all
in when night came.
'On some of our marches we only
bad beans and hardtack and some days
only boiled field corn. But we are bet
ter fixed now.
'Some of the members of the bat
tery were down in a ssloun last night
drinking beer,, when a bunch of Mexi
can soldiers came up and Bred on them.
One of the boys was wounded in the
arm. The Mexicans captured the shack
and took the boys prisoners. The pris
oners were carried down to tbe Mexi
can garrison, lined up against a dobie
wall and were just being made ready
to be shot when we appeared. The
Mexicana did not want to release their
captivea, but our captain bad us train
guna on tnem ana commanaea an im
mediate reiaese ox tne prisoners.
'Six Mexicans were killed in tbe sa
loon acrap and about 20 wounded, but
w have little skirmishes like tnai
very often.
"We are not permuted to write let
ters giving out information. Indeed,
all soldiea' mail is subjected to a cen
sorship. .
"Please thank the memoers 01 tne
Woman'a Relief Corps for me and the
other boys, and tell them we certainly
appreciate the reading matter, tbey

ASSOCIATION SIGNS
MANY NEW MEMBERS
When the apple marketing . season
opens this fall the Apple Growers As
sociation will handle a larger tonnage
of the apples of the Hood River valley
than ever in any former season. Ship
ments the coming sutumn by indepen
dents will be practically negligible, as
practically the entire crop will be
handled through the Fruit Growers'
Exchange and the Apple Growers As
sociation. During the past few weeks, according
to Wilmer Sieg, from one to five grow
ers, who formerly shipped their fruit
independently or through outside con
cerns, have daily signed contracts with
the cooperative orgsnization.
Mr. Sieg has suggested to his board
of directors that affiliations be limited
to July 1, in order thst a definite esti
mate of the tonnage to be bandied tbe
coming sales season may be compiled.
Haste in Road Work Urged
Editor Glacier: The Columbia River
highway stretches from Hood Kiver to
Portland, a distance of 66 miles, the
part in Multnomah co.unty being hard
surfaced. The part in Hood River
county will no doubt be hardsurfaced
some time by the state of Oregon,
which operation will have to be sanc
tioned by the legislature, for tbe reason
that the county of Hood River is small
and ill able to afford the luxury, and
for tbe further reason that the road is
by rights a connecting link between
eastern and western Oregon. In the
meantime the road is being used as it is.
But also in tbe mean time the state
of Washington is awake, and some
morning old Rip Van Winkle Oregon is
going to wake up and discover that
while he was lazily lying asleep on the
job the state of Washington and Ska
mania county have constructed a road
on the north bank of the Columbia
river that is a road. Twenty-four feet
wide, all grades five per cent or less
and a whole lot of it is done.
Not much noise is being made over
it, but it is building. Oregon and
Washington started even, but Seattle
has hustled while Portland dreamed
he owned the Columbia river basin
and the trade thereof, and now Wash
ington has twice the population of Or
egon. And she is going to bsve a 24
foot road all tbe way to Hood River
before Oregon has one. That is a
joke, it is. Citizen.
MILITARY SPIRIT PER
VADES FIRE RANKS
The 30 members of the Hood River
Volunteer fire department may form
the nucleus of a local company of vol
unteers, if the call comes for addition
al forces to go to Mexico. '
"I have discussed tbe matter with
the boys," says Chief Morgan, "and
although about half of tbem are mar
ried men, 1 find that all are willing to
answer the call if it is necessary."
Even though the necessity of immed
iate fighting for their country does not
piesent itself, tbe Volunteer tire lads
may organize a company of the Na
tional Guard.
"Hood River ought to have a mili
tary company," says R. B. Perigo, an
officer of the fire fighters. "The train
ing that we will get from such an or
ganization will be good, and if enough
interest can be aroused the agitation
already begun may lead to a Hood
River company."
NEW SYSTEM
TAKES HOLD
COMMUNITY PACK ADVANTAGEOUS
Pioneer Packing Co., First Central Insti
tion, is Successful and Adds
New Members
Judging from tbe present trend to
ward the new system, the day Jis not
far distant when all orchardists in the
Hood River valley owning tracts of 10
acres or less will harvest their apple
crops through community packing
houses. Three years ago the commun
ity system was first proposed by grow
ers of the Oak Grove district. Five
growers, Geo. C. Gladen, H. M. Fran
cis, Paul R. Hughes ;and D. L. Pier
son, formed a cooperative organization
called tbe Pioneer Packing Co. At the
time it was not convenient for tbe
orchardists to secure funds for the con
struction of a new plant. Space, how
ever, was secured in a centrally located
blacksmith shop, and the new enter
prise has been successful.
Last season the Pioneer Packing Co.
handled 8,600 boxes of fruit for its
affiliated members. During the past
week it has added three new members,
O. T. Wedemeyer, W. F. Andrews and
T. J. Annala.
The success of central packing baa
stimulated growers of other parts of
tbe valley to initiate plans for such or
ganizations. Meetings were recently
held in the Pine Grove district, and al
ready membera of the Apple Growers
Associaton located in that section of
the apple district have offered to furn
ish 75,000 boxes of apples to a new
plsnt thst will be erected at some cen
tre! point there before the harvesting
season of the coming autumn. A
meeting was held at the Thomas Flag
ler home in the Barrett district the
past week, when Barrett grower!
stsrted a campaign for a central pack
ing plant.
Without a regard to the appealing
ssving in cost of handling the fruit,
community packing houses are justified
because of the advantages accruing
from a uniform pack. C. W. Hooker
and William Dickerson, representaives
of the Association the past season re
spectively in Loa Angeles and San
Francisco, declare that the community
packing bouse is one of the best assist
ants the salesman has. Wilmer Sieg
is a heart exponent of the system, and
the sales organization is fostering the
plans of growers of different district!
in their efforts to finance central pack
ing concerns. ' '
Where an individual grower has a
small crew of men at work engaged in ,
tbe barvest and packing of bis crop,
the apples oftentimes are allowed to
remain several days in orchard boxea
before they are ready for delivery to
association warehouses and placed in
cold storage. This delsy, it is said, in
many instances results in bad condition
of apples at time of distribution.
The community system appeals alike
to grower and to the harvest laborer.
The orchardist is freed from the bother
of caring for a host of pickers and
packers. Sleeping and mess accommo
dations are provided for at tbe central
packing house. Tbe harvester is as
sured of steady work over a longer
period. Better help is thus obtained
and held.
The community svstem also makes
its appeal to larger growers, because
of tbe resulting smaller cost of band-
ling tbe fruit. Tbe first example of
the community system on a large scale
is found in the huge packing plant or
the Hood River Apple & Storage Co.
which is not only equipped with ma
chines for grading the fruit, but has
its own refrigerating plant, where the
crops of its members may be held in
storage throughout tbe season.
A second Uak urove community pack
ing house will be erected this summer
on the Sutthoff place. It will be
equipped with a new grading machine
and the crops of a number of surround
ing orchards will be handled.
Under the community system the ap
ples, if tbe individual does not happen
to have teaming facilities, are taken
from the trees and delivered, properly
graded and packed, at the Association
warehouses.
Tbe committee in charge of the Pine
Grove community arrangements is com
posed of Dr. Stanton Allen and Clar
ence E. Coffin.
The Pioneer Packing Co. recently
purchased one of the Isrge size Cutler
grading machines. This purchase will
enable tbe company to care for all the
fruit in the Oak urove neighborhood.

R. T. NewbaU is Dead
News baa just been received here of
tbe destb on June 19, in Minneapolis,
Minn., of R. T. Newhsll. formerly a
local nurseryman and landsespe gar
dener. Death was caused from tuber
culosis.
Mr. Newhall ia survied by his widow
and three small children.
(By Leroy Cbilda)
Several advantages may be gained by .
not thinning the apples too early this
year. From a purely horticultural
standpoint the greatest advantage from
a practice of this sort can be gained by
early thinning in that by removing the
unnecessary fruits growth ia thrown
into tbe remaining apples anu tree.
However, consideration of the crop in
hand is equally important. Early thin
ning doea not give the grower a chanca
to remove scabby, wormy or spray
burned fruit and thereby increases bis
crop production and grade.
The combined rains of the past few
days will undoubtedly increase scab in
fection, wmcn win not snow on in
fruit for about fifteen days. Grower!
who have used lime-sulphur recently
should also wait through a spell of hot
weather in order that they may thin
out tbe sunburned apples, for there
will undoubtedly be some.
Between tbe 1st and lutn or July
most of tbe codling moths will have
batched and the wormy applea will be
easily "spotted." Wormy applea ahould
all be removed from tbe orcnaro ana
destroyed. Development of tbe worm
continues if tbe applea are thrown on
tbe ground, thereby increasing tbe
numbers of tbe second generation of
moths.
At this time the activities of the
leaf-roller will be over and the injured
applea ahould be removed. Thinning
should never be attempted in orchards
infected with leaf-roller until the feed
ing worms are entirely gone, for in
disturbing tbem they are quite liable
to leave an injured apple and attack a
sound one.
