goes in, then, according to my opin

organization of other companies.

that the country would get no better

WIlfRELEASE
An immediate break between the
United States and Mexico has been
averted by compliance with the Amer
ican demand for release of the twenty-three
troopers captured in the fight
at Carrizal.
Whether war has been prevented or
merely postponed no one would at
tempt to say. Official information as
to the attitude of General Carranza
was lacking. Until his response to
Secretary Lansing's note, dispatched

ident Wilson shall lay the crisis before

Undisguised Relief.
News of the release of the prisoners
received in press dispatches brought
undisguised relief to high officials.
It was accepted ag correct and assured
that Carranza, impressed with the ur
gency of the situation, had ordered
Je Ptured cavalrymen started for
the border without waiting for his an
nouncement to reach Washington.
vvniie it generally is conceded that
this move lessens tension and makes
the crisis less imminent, no one con
versant with the grave problem lost
sight of the fact that the all-important
question of Carranza's attitude toward
the American expedition across the
border to protect the territory and
citizehs of the United States from
bandit outrages remains 4 unsettled.
If the de facto government stands upon
the orders to General TTSvihoto at-i
tack Pershing's men when they move
otherwise than toward the border, the
situation actually is just what is was
before, except that there now is a
possibility of diplomatic negotiation
that did not exist while the Americans
were held at Chihuahua.

States for war will go steadily for
ward. There will be no interruption
of the rush of national guardsmen to
the border and General Punston will
continue disposing of his forces as
though he expected an immediate at
tack. Carranza's compliance with one of
the demands is accepted by the more
optimistic officials as an indication
that he is striving to prevent a break.
Even though he again should attempt
to throw all blame for the Carrizal
fight on the American officers and in
sist upon his right to forcibly oppose
any except northward movements pt
American troops, it is thoughtpossi
ble that he will state his position in
such a way as to make further dis
cussion necessary. ,
