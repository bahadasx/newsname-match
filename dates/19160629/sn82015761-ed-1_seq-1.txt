A MO I!
GUARD ORGANIZED
-
At a public Dieting of Williams;
citizens held i the city hall last
Monday night steps were taken to
organize a . Home Guard. The
Supervisors of Coconino County
have offered to furnish equipment
for such an orgaaization.
A result of the meeting was a
committee of three, T. F. Maddoek,
Geo. McDougall and Chas. Button,
on organization. This committee
will select those really fit for Home
Guard membership, provide officers
and etart the drilling so necessary
for the efficient coordination of
guard members.'
A committee often was also pro-
' vided for, five to be Americans and
five tu be Mexicans, whose duty
will be .to establish and maintain a
friendly feeling between the Amer
icans and Mexican of Williams.
It was realized by all present at the
meeting that the interests of both
American and Mexican in Williams
- are identical. It is in the interest
of all that law shall be respected
And that order shall obtain. The
only danger' to be feared is that
:Some irresponsible person, either
American or Mexican, shall thru
some rash act precipitate h clash."
r This clash might be between Amerr
icaos as .the result of ' factional
spirit or it might be be twee ji Amerr
. icans and Mexicans as the result of
. raee prejudice, out . whatever the
cause, it was felt by the' meeting
that there should be & seirii-mili-tary
organization to take care of it
in the interest of law and order
and the general good. , ' ' "I
, the ommiltee of conciliation are
- T. Maddoek, Bobb TJurns;" R.
A.-Sickerson, F. M. Gold and Geo.
McDouglL The Mexican mem
bers will be Jesus Quijada and four
others to be selected by him.

TWO LARGE FOREST FIRES
Since the middle of last week
forest fires have been raging on
and about Kendrick Peak and in
the Sitgreaves Mountains. At
the present writing, Tuesday P.
M., (they are practically out.
These fires are tbe worst the
Forest Service has had to deal
with, v Fire-figb ting lias been
continuous.', for nearly a whole
week with all the fighting forces
that could be mustered. The
areas burned over are, approxim
ately, 1,200 acres for the Sit
greaves " and 1,700 acres for
Kendrick' Peak.- ";
Not . much ' saw timber- was
burned by-? these .fires," but a
great many- young trees were
killed. This young- timber .was
thick and protected the mount
ain slopes very effectually from
denudation. With the trees gone
the slopes are exposed to wash
and.the consequence will be that
the slopes will not be productive
of anything of use but, on the
contrary, will hasten the water
fall down the canyons and tend
to increase the destruction of
floods. ' . '
Forest fires are caused by
human carelessness one does
not like to think ever by design.
These fires which have just rav
aged the Sitgreaves and Kend
rick Peak, should be a warning
to everyone who by any chance
might be responsible for a for
est fire to be very careful in the
future.

NEITHER BONDS NOR '
SPECIAL TAX REQUIRED
' Williams people especially Wil
liams tax payers will be rejoic
ed to learn that the proposed add
ition to the school building will
require neither bonds nor special
tax.
There is. fortunately, a fund on
hand of $2,000 which 'is available
for the new school building. A
little later money will come from
the Forest Service, derived from
timber sales. The Williams State
Bank will furnish all necessary
f'inds for the short period before
the Forest Service money is avail
able. The school board has been in
something of a quandary just what
to do to secure more school room,
but they have now decided to add
to the present building and not
buy another building as has been
contemplated.
It is the inter tion of the school
board to have the addition ready
for occupancy by the beginning of
the new school year.

partizan or' anization, but as in
dicated by its name strictly a:
Woodrow . Wilson Club. The
constitution as later adopted, in
denning the eligibility of mem

a. citizen of Coconino county and
announces their determinatipn

other political affiliation, is en
titled to become a member.'' '
