East Fifth street, died at the Sama
ritan hospital yesterday morninir
from a bullet wound inflicted bv
Joseph O'Brien, night marshal at
Jackson, Neb., early Wednesday
morning. He was 58 years old.
Kirnbel-was operated upon Wednes
day morning, but had lost so much
blood through his refusaf of medical
aid that he failed to rally. Little
hope for his recovery was entertain
ed from the first. Twelve intestinal
punctures and a large bullet hole
through the front wall of the abdo
men were Bewed up in the slight
hope that Kirnbel would bo able to
muster sufficient strength to success
fully battle with his wounds. Some
mystery surrounds the shooting of
Kirnbel. He never made a state
ment further than to say he did not
know why he was shot. Kirnbel
drove to Hubbard, Neb., Tuesday,
accompanied by William Shirley, a
friend. He disposed of a load of
empty beer bottles and was return
ing by way of Jackson. About 1:30
oclock Wednesday morning he ar
rived at Jackson, and. instructing
Shirley to remain with the rig, walk
ed uown the main street. Marshal
O'Brien says he saw Kirnbel walk
ing down the street lookinir into
windows. He commanded Kirnbel to
Mop, but was not obeyed. After re
peating the order several timea the
marshal says he fired at Kimbers
feet. O'Brien did not realize he had
hit the Sioux City man until he learn
ed it from here later. The marshal
said robberies have been frequent at
Jackson and he was suspicious of
Kimbel's actions. O'Brien insists
he merely souirht to scare Kirnbel.
Kirnbel staggered back to his wagon
and returned to Sioux City with Shir
ley, whom ho forebade to call medi
cal aid. He yielded to persuasion
only after reaching his home, fol
lowing a three hours' drive from
Jackson. He was then hauled to
the hospital in the same conveyance,
a further distance of about three
miles. Kirnbel is survived by his
widow and a stepson, George Kirn
bel 19 years old.

Albion Npwjs: . ,W. PvYarnor, re
publican candidate for congress in
this district, was in Albion last Sat
urday between trains. He had been
at St. Edwards the night before to
address the commercial club meet
ing. Mr. Warner expects to. make
a clean and vigorous campaign this
fall, and hopes to meet as many of
the people as possible. He was
United States marshal for ten years,
and made many friends by his able,
efficient and afi'ablo manner of do-
ing business. Ho is an attorney by
profession, but a farmer by trade.
He is at peesent living on a farm
five miles from Dakota City, where
he went as soon as hi3 term of office
expired last year. This congression
al district is slightly democratic on
a normal vote, but those who are
posted believe that Mr. Warner will
overcome the handicap and be elect
ed by a nice margin.
