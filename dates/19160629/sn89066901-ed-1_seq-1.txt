CREAM MUST BE O.K.
The Pure Food Man Will
Get You if You Don't
Watch Out
R. E. L. Marrs, of Carthage,
assistant dairy commissioner,
connected with the Missouri
State Board of Agriculture, was
here4ast weekhaving been sent
here bjr the board to investigate
numerous Complaints from bter
the state that bad cream. Was
being shipped from Mansfield,
in violation fif the pure food laws
of the state. In company with
the local health officer, Dr, J. A.
Fusori, he visited the , various
cream buying stations and found
some bad conditions existing.
In conversation with a Mirror
representative he said that while
it is a fact that .the law was
being violated, that he would
make no prosecutions ' at this
time, preferring rather to give
any offenders a chance, as the
violations might be through ig
norance, their attention not hav
ing been called to the matter
previously, but that on his next
trip here he would prosecute all
found disregarding this law, as
an opportunity had been given
to rectify conditions and comply
strictly with the law. Mr. Marrs
suys there is nothing worse
than bad cream and that it is the
intention to' vigorously enforce
the laws forbidding the sale by
any persons of bad cream.
There have been numerous
supreme court decisions upon
the matter, and we take the fol
lowing from a bulletin issued by
the board:
It is a grave oflvnse to sell bad
eggs; or milk or cream or butter
which is dirty or was produced
from a diseased cow, or is below
grade, or to which a preserva
tive has been added; or meats of
animals which have died other
wise than by slaughter; or vine
gar which is below standard; or
fruit under false names as to
variety or place of production;
or to sell short measure or short
weight food of any kind. The
farmer is primarily a producer
of food and must expect to abide
by the food law, the same law
that protects him when others
sell to him.. '
Sec. 640. Adulteration of Milk
.and Milk Products; Penalties.
Whoever shall sell, or offer or
expose for sale anywhere in this
state, any milk or cream cpn
taining any foreign substance,
or preservative of any kind what
soever, injurious to health, or
shall sell or offer for sale or de
liver to another, for domestic or
portable use, or to be converted
into any product for human
food, any unclean, impure, adul
terated or unwholesome milk, or

In oraer tnat there may be a
permanent settlement of the
railroad wage problem, protect
ing the interests of the employes,
the employers and the public,
the railroads propose that the
present controversy in regard
thereto be referred for solution
to the interstate commerce com
mission at Washington. This
proposed solution has already
received the hearty endorsement
of the business men throughout
the country through a referen
dum of the U. S. Chamber of
Commerce. It has likewise been
strongly. urged by many leading
men in public life and prominent
students of economic thought in
various institutions of learning.
If the matter is not thus settled
by federal inquiry, by a body of
men with intimate knowledge of
the matter in hand, a strike
would seem imminent. In fact,
the employes affected are now
voting on the strike question.
We hate to hear of a strike. It
seems that other means could
settle the matter as fairly in
fact, more so and without the
evil results attendant upon
strikes, . their interruption of
business, their after-effects, and
the injury to life and destruction
of property, which as a rule is
one of their results. If possible,
industrial warfare is to be avert
ed and peace, plenty and pros
perity reign. Labor and capital
both have rights. Might does
not make right. An impartial
government would in our opinion
be vastly more safe and sane
more satisfactory and perma
nent, than any result determined
upon the outcome of a strike,.
Does your house need paint
ing?; If so, why not have an ex
perienced painter do your work?
I will be glad to do your paint
ing and calsomiuing and paper
hanging. Work guaranteed.

JAMES J. KYLE.
Hr. Kyle was born Dec. 27, 1867,
In a log cabin on a farm, near Kyle's
Ford, E. Tenn. At an early age, .his
parents, by reason . of . poor health.
were forced to quit the tana, and
established a little country store.
They were financially poor, but rich
in aspirations for their children. They
were of sterling qualities, and their
children early learned the lessons of
industry jA ecoiitfn)j-:---TheftTW
their son the best 'advantages withia,
their limited reach. , Mr. Kyle's edu
cation commenced 'in a log" cabin.
dirt-floor, slab-benched school house,
and was continued in the common
schools of Tennessee, Curry. College,
Ya., the Springfield Private Normal,
where he also read law, ana taking'
his last instructions in law- at the
University of Missouri. He says that
it is inconvenient to be poor, but that
it develops the best of a man made
of the right stuff, and puts him in
closer touch with the needs and de
mands of humanity.
He came to Ozark County, Missouri,
with his parents in 1890. He began
teaching at sixteen years of age and
taught a number of years. He never
had to "hunt" a school, the schools
sought him and with increased wages.
His accomplishments have been at
tained under adverse circumstances.
In 1902 he was married to Miss Ida
V., daughter of Dr and Mrs. P. L.
Cline of White Pine, Tennessee.
In 108 he was elected to the Leg
islature, where his services gave him
such recognition that he was re-elect
ed to the Forty-seventh and Forty
eighth General Assemblies. He was
elected by the Republicans as their
speaker and floor leader of the house
in both the Forty-seventh and Forty
eighth General Assemblies. His rec
ord is an open book. Kis efforts
have ever been tending toward the
advancement and betterment of man
kind. He is a strong supporter of the
common schools and an advocate of
liberal support to higher education.
He believes that a state as well as
an individual, should normally keep
within Its means.
Mr. Kyle can furnish pages of high
commendations from the press and
from prominent' men aU over the
state, but sutfice to say that ere he
became a candidate, his own, and
many other southern counties gave
bim strong endorsements. His con
gressional convention of the Four
teenth District, representing sixteen
counties endorsed him as follows:
Whereas, we are familiar with the
personal and public record of J. J. Kyle
of Thornfleld, Ozark County, and be
cause of that acquaintance and because
of having full and complete confidence
in his ability and integrity as a clti
ten and his fidelity to every trust
imposed by the important offices le
has held, and feeling that the age
demands the services in this state of
man of wide business experience,
known integrity, dynamic energy, and
one who has been closely associated
with Missouri's history in the past,
therefore be it
"Resolved, that we endorse the
candidacy of James J. Kyle for the
nomination for Lieutenant-Governor
ot Missouri, and that we invite and
urge the co-operation ot all good clti-
sens of the State ot Missouri in se
curing his nomination and election
with full assurance that it elected
4 will conduct the affairs of this
Important office in a manner to re
flect credit to himself and to the
entire state."
The conservative, judicious records
of the Republican membership of the
Forty-seventh and Forty-eighth Gen
eral Assemblies, led by Mr. Kyle, as
compared with that of the opposition,
will contribute greatly towards mak
ing Missouri Republican in November,

THE OZARK TRAILS
Decision as to Official Road
Between Springfield and
St. Louis Not Made
At the Ozark Trails convention
at Springfield this week the
question as to whether the
Southern or Northern Route
should be named as the official
route was postponed until Nov
15, notwithstanding the fact that
the Southern Route delegation
insisted that the matter should
be decided at this meeting, ac
cording to schedule. Our people
feel that the decision should
have been made now. We want
the route. Let's keep on trying
to secure it.
With the American flag greet
ing them on all. sides, the auto
mobiles bearing delegates over
the Southern Route of the pro
posed Ozark Trail between
Springfield and St. Louis passed
through ' here all day Monday
enroute to Springfield to attend
the annual meeting of the Ozark
Trails Association. Four -states
were represented officially at
this convention Missouri, Kan
sas, Oklahoma and Arkansas, for
this is a link' in a transconti
nental highway project.
About 15 or 20 auto loads went
from Mansfield, besides the nu
merous delegates who went on
the train, . Several cars from
Hartville and Ava also joined in
the crowd. The Mansfield Con
cert Band, together with some
players from Hartville and Ava,
accompanied the Mansfic-ld dele
gation to help furnish music for
the convention and make a noise
for Mansfield. The Mansfield
delegation was headed by Mayor
FR Rjjeiasji
delegate wore ribbon - bearing
these inscriptions: 'Southern
Route Delegate, June 27-28, 18;"
"Mansfield, the Gem City of the
Ozarks." M. A. Freeman, chair
man of the finance committee,
was one of the officials of the
convention.
Over 100 autos went through
here, some coming before Mon
day. A big truck from the state
highway department passed
through here Sunday.
A big Mountain Grove delega
tion, accompanied by the Moun
tain Grove band, passed through
here Tuesday morning over the
Frisco enroute to the convention.
M.A.FreemanandDr F.H.Ri
ley were members of a commit
tee from the Southern Route del
egation who met at Springfield
Tuesday evening to form a defi
nite plan of action in regard to
the establishment of the Ozark
Trails between Springfield and
St, Louis.
The Mansfield Concert Band
was one of the hits of the con
vention. The Jonesboro, Ark.,
delegates paid a $5.00 member
ship fee for each of the band
boys, making them members of
the Ozark .Trails Association,
and told them to consider them
selves the official band and to
come to Jonesboro and play next
year.
Some of the returning autos
made good time on the road, D.
S. Cantrell making the trip in 2
hours and 30 minutes and G. C.
Freeman in 2 hours and 20 min
utes.
. Mansfield has attracted con
siderable attention and news
paper comment. at the conven
tion. Tuesday 's Leader says : ' .
Mansfield, on the southern
highway to St. Louis, has large
delegation at the convention.
About twenty five automobiles
carried the delegation into
Springfield yesterday evening.
The Mansfield delegates, headed
by Dr. F. H. Riley, mayor of
Mansfield, created considerable
excitement during the conven
tion by a lusty yell. It is an
Ozark Trails yell, as follows:
One-a zippa, two-a zippa, three-
a zippa, tfastj; A-M! (drag):
We're on the Southern Route,
and don't give a (hesitate):
Razzle dazzle! - Hobble gobble!
(rapid). Rah! Rah! Rah! (rapid).
Have the roads and scenery.
Mining News
Several more miners arrived
here last week.
The first full car load of ore
that has been shipped from
Mansfield since the recent re
vival of the mining industry in
this vicinity was shipped to Jop
lin Saturday, and consisted of
silicate and jack of good quality.
The shipment was made by A.
T. Friend, ' who has been quite
active in developing the mineral
resources of this community and
calling to the attention of others
the fact that mineral exists here
and in paying quantities.
The Bryant Mining Company
are working their mine on Pond
Fork creek four miles southwest
of Thornfleld. They report that
about five tons of mineral have
been taken out valued at about
$200. They have drifted into the
hill thirty feet and the ore is
getting better the further they
go. This mine is owned by E. B.
Lefler, Graham Wallace,-George
Freet and Elmer Hunsaker. The
Pond Fork mine is expected to
be the best paying mine ever
found in that part of Ozark
county. The machinery for sep
arating fhe rock from the min
eral is about complete, and the
work of cleaning and sacking
the mineral for shipment twill
begin in a few days. The first
shipment will" be made in the
next week or two. It will be
hauled to- Ava in wagons and
shipped out over the K, C. O. &
