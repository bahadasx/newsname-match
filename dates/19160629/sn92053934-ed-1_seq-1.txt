His Crime. t
London, Jnne 29. Sir Rnctr
fakement was found guilty today
of hiirh treason. The endinir of
the historic trial came shortly he
fore 1 o'clock this afternoon. The
jury had been ont less than an
hour.

eharce to the jury.
ir Koecr was sentenced to
death.
After Sir Roger had been sentenced,
Danie! J. Bailey, the private soldier
who had been held as his accomplice,
was discharged. After the verdict Sir
Roger began to read a very long statement-Sir
Roger received the sentence
with utmost composure, smiling at
friends. His statement, which occu
pied a half hour, was a plea for the
right to be tried by Irishmen and for
Irish nationality.
Serjeant Sullivan, the Irish barris
ter, upon whom has rested the chief
burden of the defense of Sir Roger
Casement in his trial for high treason,
was unable to appear in court today.
Serjeant Sullivan collapsed while de
livering an impassioned speech in
court last night. t-
Artemus Jones, . aSfant,.",jCpunsel.
addressed the' court ln?,f'tn'alf of Sir
Roger when it convened this morning-
Makes Strom: Flea.
Mr. Jones admitted that at the first
thought it seemed an outrage for Sir
Roger to go to Germany but he insist
ed that the- defendant had attempted
merely to organize an Irish brigade
for use aginst the Ulster volunteers
recruited by Sir Edward Carson. He
contended that the work Sir Roger did
in Germany was precisely the same
sort of work he carried on in Ireland
before the war.
After Mr. Jones' speech, the attorney
general, Sir Frederick Smith, began
summing up. He argupd that in days
before the war Sir Roger's defense
might have had some weight but "one
circumstance not insignificant had in
tervened the greatest military power
the world had ever seen was trying to
destroy the British empire."

deron. minister of Bolivia, and Rafael
Zalridar, minister of Salvador, called
at the state department today to renew
their efforts to learn whether the Unit
ed States would entertain an otter of
mediation in the Mexican difficulty.
Mr. Calderon talked with Secretary
Lansing about five minutes. After
ward he said he had been told that the
United States could not discuss medi
ation in the absence of information
that the American prisoners actually
had been released and as to Carranza's
reply to the demand for a statement
of intentions toward the expedition in
Mexico.
The minister told Mr. Lansing of the
interest of all the American republics
in preservation of peace and said he
would call again when Carranza's re
ply to the note of the United States
had been received.
BUSGH MILLIONS

Weeks of Waiting.
Chicago, June 29. The will of the
late Mrs. Anna Anheuser Busch, dis
posing of $4,000,000, today rested in
the archives of the Cook county pro
bate court, after a trip from Berlin
negotiated through the state depart

Mrs. Busch, who died at Pasadena,
Cal., on April 8, was the daughter of
the founder of the Anheuser-Busch
Rrewing company, widow of Ulrich
Busch and sister-in-law of the late
Ariolphus Busch of St. Louis, Mo.
The will, which was executed when
Mrs. Busch was the guest of relatives
in Berlin and had remained in the
custody of Miss Lilly Alexa Busch,
who resides in Berlin. The American
heirs heard no word from Miss Busch.
From censorship or other causes, their
letters were unanswered. Finally the
stale department was appealed to and ,
after it had "f nBiflmifiti
tfonT"fib-"'11fwas started American
ward about ten weeks ago.

RELIEF FELT
AT CHANGE IN
MEXICO CASE
Danger of an Immediate
Break Seems More Re
mote by Carranza Act.
CRISIS STILL GRAVE
War Only Less Imminent
Until De Facto Head Re
plies to Ultimatum.
Washington, June 29. Danger of an
immediate break had been relieved
last night by press dispatches saying
the prisoners had been started for the
border from Chib.uab.na City. Until
Carranza replies to the demand for a
statement toward the American expe
dition in Mexico to protect the border,
however, the crisis is only less immi
nent than it was before.
High officials of the administration
let it be known that the United States
would proceed with its military op
erations to adequately safeguard its
citizens and territory and would con
tinue to pursue bandits in Mexico
whenever there was hope of overtak
ing them, regardless of any action
Mexican military commanders may
take.
It was apparent about the war and
state departments today that the re
lease of the prisoners had made the
situation less critical. It had no ef
fect, however, on efforts to speed up
the mobilization of the national guard
along the international line and to fur
nish an adequate supply of war ma
terial to meet any emergency.
It is clearly indicated here that
President Wilson is determined, by
force, if necessary to employ the army
either alons---the .line-.or in Mexico in
such a way as to insure the 6afety of
American lives and property.
Fnnston Headquarters Busy.
San Antonio, Texas, June 29 Staff
officers and departmental chiefs at
General Funston's headquarters con
tinued today the work of shaping the
hourly increasing army for a possible
offensive movement.
Notification that Carranza had or
dered the release of American troops
captured after the Carrizal fight did
not lower the high pressure of mili
tary preparation. Ilie opinion was
that the danger of ankipen break with
Carranza's troops had not been great
ly lessened.
Trains bearing certain units of
eastern national guardsmen were ex
pected to cross state line during
the day, and by night it was believed
that national guardsmen enroute
would be nearing stations along the
border.
Supplies were being assembled at
Brownsville, Laredo, Eagle Pass and
other points on the border, where the
greater concentrations will be made.
Buying of horses and mules was
under way today under the first con
tract ratified yesterday by the war de
partment. Buyers of horses and mules
were here today with herds they had
obtained from Texas farms and
ranges.
If Ion Want to Fight, Jain Army.
If you want to go to Mexico, join the
army or the national guard. That is
the advice being given to thousands
who have volunteered their services
by officers at army headquarters here.
General Funston has had dozens of
offers to raise "rough rider" regi
ments. Acceptance of such organiza
tions would rest entirely with officials
at Washington.
Towns and cities of Texas, Arizona
and New Mexico have sent in requests
that regulars or national guardsmen
be stationed in their vicinity. The
troops, however, are to be stationed
according to viewpoint of military ex
pediency and necessity.
PILLORY ADOPTED
FOR WIFE BEATERS
Kansas City, Mo., June 29. The pil
lory, slightly changed, but the same in
effect, is to be resurrected from the
old Puritan days and set up again in
Kansas City, Kan. Wife beaters will
find themselves its victims.
Judge J. H. Brady, police Judge of
that city, was granted permission by
the cfty commissioners today to erect
a post on a corner of the main busi
ness district, to which men convicted
of beating his wife would be chain
ed during the day under the watch of
a traffic patrolman for any number of
days the court fixed.
'The shame of being seen, labeled
as a wife beater, will prevent such
crimes, I believe," the Judge explained.
"But I am sorry we can't make a whip
ping post"

Iowa Guards
AreRefusing
to Take Oath
Des Moines, Iowa, Jnne 29. Captain
J. C. MacGregor of D. troop, cavalry,
of the national guard of Iowa, today
received a telcgTam from citizens of
West Branch, his home, saying:
"Ton tried to take our boys to war;
you need not return to this town."
This information was brought to
Camp Dodge today by Major Howell,
commanding the cavalry, two-thirds of
which yesterday refused to take the
federal oath at North Liberty. Major
Howell, Adjutant General Logan,
Brigadier General Allen and Colonel
Morgan, U. S. A., chief mustering of
ficer of the Iowa guard, held a long
conference today regarding further
steps to be taken as to the disposition
of the cavalry. Colonel Morgan sug
gested the troop be brought to Des
Moines and ther recruited to peace
strength and it seemed probable this
will be done, although Adjutant Gen
eral Logan refused to say what his
plans were.
Funds may be provided, it was said
to buy overalls in which to send home
the "slackers." It is not believed they
will be permitted to wear uniforms.
No word reached the camp today
from the war department regarding
probable movement of the Iowa guard.
Arrangements for troop cars are going
forward satisfactory but no word
has reached the camp from the war
department as to when the movement
order would be issued.
ARREST SOLDIER

'Springfield, 111., June 29. Arthur
Brown, a colored infantryman, mem
ber of Company F, Eighth regiment,
was arrested in the barracks of the
regiment at Camp Dunne this morn
ing by military authorities, in con
nection with the killing early this
monrftfg"tT"palrolman Frank J. Crow
ley, a Springleld policeman. '
Brown is said to have made a con
fession to Colonel Denison, command
er of the Eighth regiment. He also
made a written statement to Assist
ant State's Attorney Adolph Bernard
this morning.
In his statement to Bernard, Brown
says he came down town last night in
company with three other members
of his company. They went to the
rear of the saloon of Percy McCloud,
where a dance was in progress. Brown
says he didn't dance or drink, but sat
about watching the others dance.
When the saloon closed at midnight,
the soldiers went outside, where
Brown says they met some crap shoot
ers. One of the men pulled a gun on
him. Brown says, and he limbered up
his army pistol and shot into the air.
The four then walked away, accord
ing to Brown's story. They had gone
a block when they met two police
men. One was Crowley.
Brown says Crowley pointed his re
volver at him, and he declared he then
pulled his gun and fired at the po
liceman. When the patrolman drop
ped, he ran, the other policeman firing
at him. He hid all night in a lumber
yard and went to his company quar
ters at Camp Dunne early this morn
ing. Brown is held a prisoner in the city
prison. He gives his address as S628
Dearborn street, Chicago. No formal
charge has been lodged against him.
Bloomington, 111., June 29. Jacob
Collins, a negro, aged 30, received a
shot in the eye here early today from
a shot gun when he failed to throw
up his hands when ordered to do so
by local policemen, who had surround
ed the fast Chicago & Alton train.
Collins, who was riding on top of a
coach, was suspected of being the
slayer of Policeman Frank J. Crowley
of Springfield last night, and local of
ficers were notified to watch this train
for suspects. The negro wore an
army shirt, but denies he shot the
Springfield man.

SECOND PART
OF ILLINOIS

First Infantry Regiment Al
ready on Way Others
Leaving Today.
ENTRAINING RAPIDLY
Work of Starting Forces on
Trip to Border Being
Rushed Through.
Springfield, 111., June 29 At 3
o'clock this afternoon the Second
infantry regiment of the Illinois
national guard will depart for San An
tonio, Texas, to join the First infan
try, I. N. G., in helping General Fun
ston police the Mexican border. Some
time tonight the Seventh infantry will
pull out of Camp Dunne and about
forty-eighth hours later these three
regiments comprising the first brigade
of the Illinois troops will again be a
unit under the direct command of
General D. Jack Foster.
Before the regiments leave the mob
ilization camp each man is examined
by seven regular army physicians, his
rifle is tested and his equipment in
spected. Although it is understood
that tentage for the First brigade
will be supplied by the government at
the border, Governor Dunne, to make
the troops' comfort doubly sure, today
ordered tents and camp equipment be
longing to the state sent along with
each regiment.
While the Second and Seventh in
fantries were loading their equipment
on the trains this morning, the second
squadron of the First cavalry, came to
Camp Dnnne on street cars, being
without horses, for medical examina
tion. Their examination and that of
the field artillery will be completed
late today and there is a slight possi
bility that the cavalry may entrain
late tonight The artillery and field
hospitals will depart probably tomor
row. Artillery to Go in Battalions.
Colonel E. M. Lewis, chief mustering
officer of the United States army, who
has a blanket order to dispatch the
troops southward as fast as they be
come "reasonably well prepared for
field service," said today he would
send the artillery to the border at bat
talions. B C. and E. batteries prob
ably will form the first brigade and D.,
F. and A., the second. All but A. bat
tery have been mustered into the fed
eral service and it will be mustered
late today or the first thing tomorrow.
The Third, Fourth and Eighth in
fantry regiments also are yet to be
mustered, but the mustering officers
have orders to complete the inspection
and the distribution of ordnance
among the Second and Seventh first.
The downstate regiments and the
negro regiments therefore may not be
mustered until tomorrow.
Adjutant General Dickson said the
Seventh infantry would be ready to
pull out of camp at 7 o'clock tonight.
1,107 With Second.
The Second infantry takes 1,107 en
listed men and 53 officers to the bor
der. Although every man in the regi
ment had complete or nearly complete
ordnance equipment, about 50 marched
out in civilian clothes and about 100
more in mixed uniforms. These will
be supplied with uniforms at the
border.
The last act of each regiment be
fore leaving camp was to comb its
quarters, picking up every piece of pa
per and other refuse.
It was definitely decided this morn
ing that the First cavalry would not
get away until 5 o'clock tomorrow aft
ernoon. The cavalry will be prepared
to leave Camp Lincoln tonight, but a
lack of horses will make it impossible
to get the regiment's equipment and
supplies moved from the camp to the
railroad station, a distance of live
miles, by that time.
MEXICANS SLAY
MAN AT DUBUQUE
Dubuque, Iowa, June 29 John Mul
len, aged 40, a Dubuque carpenter, was
beaten to death in East Dubuque, 111.,
shortly before noon today by three
Mexican section men employed by the
Burlington railroad. They had beei
engaged in an altercation, the nature
of which was not learned. Two of the
Mexicans escaped in the willows alonf
the Mississipl but the third was ar
rested and lodged in jail. Excitement
is running high in the Illinois town.

New York, June 29. A committee
headed by Darwin J. Mezerele of
Brooklyn, left here for Washington
early today carrying a resolution
adopted at a mass meeting in Cooper
Union last night, requesting President
Wilson and congress to recall the
American troops from Mexico ant
asking the Latin-American countries

AustroNote
on Petrolite
Is Due Soon
Washington, June 29. Austria's
probable reply to the United States'
demand for reparation for the Aus
trian submarine attack on the Amer
ican tank steamer Petrolite waa the
subject of considerable comment here
today.
To satisfy the United States, the new
note dispatched yesteday says that the
Austrian government must promptly
apologize for the attack, punish the
submarine commander and pay in
demnity. It describes the act as a de
liberate insult to the flag of the Uni
ted States and an invasion of the
rights of American citizens. The at
tack occurred in the Mediterranean
Dec. 5.
The note flatly contradicts Austria's
claims that the Petrolite's captain vol
untarily gave up supplies taken from
the steamer by the submarine com
mander, that warning shots were fired
across the vessel's bow before she was
shelled and that her appearance was
such as to justify the submarine com
mander in mistaking her for a cruiser.
NEWSPAPERS WIN
BY SENATE'S ACT
Section Seven of Postoffice Appropria
tion Bill So Amended That Press
Retains Freedom-
Washington, June 29. The senate
yesterday afternoon so amended sec
tion 7 of the postoffice appropriation
bill that Postmaster General Burle
son cannot use the authority granted
in it as a club to force newspapers
and periodicals to support the pres
ent administration.
As the section was passed in the
house, it provided that the postmaster
general might arbitrarily send all sec
ond class mail by freight instead of
mail trains if ho desired. Discretion
in the matter was left to him, and
under the terms of UUe section he
might have ordereTTT0ffnouaTt6'go
by freight and allow a competitor to
retain the mail privileges.
Publishers in all parts of the conn-
try protested against the passage of
the section because they feared the
power granted the postmaster gen
eral might be used improperly.
The senate yesterday, in adopting
amendments offered by Senators La
Follette and Norris, provided that the
postmaster general could not discrim
inate between publications of the same
class, such as newspapers, weekly
magazines, or monthly magazines, and
it also provided that in case of com
plaint by a publisher his order should
be automatically set aside until the
matter is adjudicated in the courts.
The United States circuit court of ap
peals is given exclusive jurisdiction
in such cases.

Release of Men.
El Paso, Tex., June 29.
Twenty-three negro troop
ers of the Tenth cavalry
and Lem Spillsbury, Mor
mon scout, captured by
the Mexicans at Carrizal
and subsequently confined
in the Chihuahua peniten
tiary, were brought to the
border at noon today and a
short time later turned
over to the American mili
tary authorities.
A shoot of laughter rose from
the thousands of Juarez Mexicans
w ho had gathered to witness the
arrival as the negroes filed from
the special train. The prisoners
were dressed in the scantiest and
most nondescript garb. Some had
on only trousers. One wore a
shirt while a towel encircled his
waist Other heads were decorated
with bandanas.
Spilsbury was dressed In a
whit dock snit.tfC appeared
OTxions. r 'Airh,iwpers were
worn and drawn from their exper
ience and all were serious save
one who wore a broad smile.
This one made himself the im
promptu spokesmen of his fellows.
"We sore are glad to get back,''
he said.
General Francisco Gonzales, Juarez
commander and Andres Garcia, Mex
ican consul, in El Paso, met the train.
General Gonzales boarded the train.
A minute later he reappeared, followed
by the guard that had escorted the
prisoners from Chihuahua.
The guard, dressed in uniform of
bright yellow, pushed back the crowd,
forming a lane through which Spills
bury and the troopers marched down
the railway tracks. They were taken
to the disinfecting plant and there
stripped and treated before being es
corted to the commandacia.
Soldiers Keep Mom.
At the commandacia the troopers
refused to discuss the Carrizal fight,
their imprisonment or their return to
the border.
"We are soldiers, not plain citizens,"
they said. "We will have to report to
our superior officers and receive their
instructions."
Spillsbury was not so uncommuni
cative, however.
Spillsbury Is Talkative,
He entered the private office of Gen
eral Gonzales and there gave out a
brief interview in which he repeated
statements he had been credited with
making at Chihuahua by General Ja
cinto Trevino. These statements were
to the effect that Captain Boyd, com
mander of the Americans at Carrizal,
persisted in advancing toward Villa
Ahumada to recover a negro deserter
after General Felix Gomez had warned
him to turn back, and after Spillsbury
had urged him to accept this advice.
Places Blame On Boyd.
This interview was arranged at the
solicitation of the Mexican officials
While Spillsbury was talking. General
Gonzales sent out for food for the
prisoners who had had nothing to eat
since leaving Chihuahua.
Spillsbury declared he did not know
who tired the first shot at Carrizal.
He said that after the second con
ference between Captain Boyd and
General Gomez, when he advised turn
ing back Captain Boyd said:
"I am the commander and it is for
you to obey."
Spillsbury declared there were Imt
76 Americans in Captain Boyd's
force.
Spillsbury said he advised Boyd that
he at least should wait until the Mex
icans tired on him.
After the battle Spillsbury said he
and the other prisoners were taken to
Villa Ahumada. where their hands
were tied and they were placed aboard
a train.
Prisoners Were Stoned.
They were stoned, he said, while
this was being done.
At Chihuahua, where they arrived
minus the greater part of their wear
ing apparel, which had been stripped
from them, they were assautled and
stoned again. He denied, however,
that at any time were the prisoners
put to work cleaning the streets.
One terrifying moment came to him,
he said in Chihuahua penitentiary
