Immediate Break Between United States
and De Facto Government Has
Been Narrowly Averted
ATTITUDE OF CARRANZA IS
STILL UNKNOWN AT WASH.
Move of Mexican Leader Lessens Tension
But Crisis Is Still Imminent-War
Preparations To Go Forward
Washington, June 28.—An immediate break between the Unit­
ed States and de facto government of Mexico has been averted
by compliance with the American demands for the release of the
2.'j troopers captured in the fijrht at Cnrrizal.
Whether a state of war has been prevented or merely post­
poned, no one would attempt to say tonight.
Official information as to the attitude of General Carranza was
lacking. Until his response to Secretary Lansing's note dis­
patched Sunday making two preemptory and distinct demands
is received, there will be no decision on whether IPvesidimt Wil­
son tiiall lay the crisis before Congress.
NVws of the release of the prisoners i*eceived early tonight in
press dispatches brought undistinguished relief to high officials.
Moreover it was assumed that. Carranza, impressed with the
urgency of the situation, had ordered the captured cavalrymen,
started for the border without waiting for his announcement of
the action to reach Washington.
'Move Lessens Tension.
While it generally is conceded that
this move lessens tension and makes
the crisis less imminent, no one con­
versant with the grave problem is los­
ing sight' ot the fact that the all-lm
portant question of Carranza's atti­
tude' toward the American expedition
across the border to protect the terri­
tory and citizens of the United States
from bandit outrages remains unset­
tled.
If the de facto government stands
upon the orders of General Trevino
to attack General Pershing's men
when they move otherwise than to­
ward the border, the situation actu­
ally is just what it was before, ex­
cept that there now is a possibility of
diplomatic negotiations that did not
exist while the Americans were held
prisoners at Chihuahua.
War Preparations Will Continue.
The preparations of the United
States for war will go steadily for­
ward. There will be no interruption
of the rush of national guardsmen to
the border, and General Funston will
continue disposing of the forces under
his command as though he expected
an immediate-attack from the Mexi­
cans.
The fact that Carranza has complied
with one of the demands is accepted
Iby the more optimistic officials here
as an indication that he is striving to
prevent a break. Even though he
again should attempt to throw all
blame for the Carrizal fight upon the
American officers, and insist upon his
rights to forcibly oppose any except
northward movements' of American
troops, it is thought that possibly he
will state.his position in such a way
as to make further discussion neces­
sary.
During any negotiations, however,
the United States will insist on free­
dom of movement of troops in Mexico,
and any attempt to interfere with
them
'Will
be met by such force as
is
necessary.
The possibility of Latin-American
offers in the situation was widely dis­
cussed tonight. It is known that pow­
erful influences have been brought to
Ibear on Carranza in the last few days
to make at least turn over the Ameri­
can prisoners. They all sent him 'the
same warning—that the United States
government meant business, and to
hold the prisoners would mean war.
Secretary Baker Awaits Report.
Secretary Baker waited at the war
department until late tonight for a re­
port from General Funston of General
Trevino's announcement that he had
sent the cavalrymen to Juarez to be
set free. He finally went home with­
out the report!
Communications Received.
Secretary Lansing had not studied
today the trio'of communications sub­
mitted to the department within the
last 24 hours by Elisio Arredondo,
Mexican ambassador-designate. They
protest against the alleged action of
a large column of General Pershing's
army toward Mexican citizens, against
the arrest of Mexicans in the United
States, and against the general eift
bargo, effected without proclamation,

Engagement Near Monte
Criste
MANY REBELS KILLED
BUT NUMBER UNKNOWN
Washington, June 28—One Ameri­
can soldier was killed and another
wounded in an engagement reported
today by Rear Admiral Camperton, be­
tween United States marines and San­
to Domingo rebels. The rebel losses
were not given.
The name of the marine killed was
given as Private John Acriment, of
the 27th company. His name does not
appear in navy department records.
Albert Vieldauem, of Aberdeen,
Wash., a private of the 27th, was
wounded.
Admiral Capcrton's report says the
engagement was fought yesterday
morning. The rebels were found in
force entrenched in a strong natural
position in two lines of trenches,
about 16 miles from Monte Christi.
They were dislodged by assault aftei
an artillery fire. A report reached
the navy department earlier in the
day from Admiral Caperton saying
that Pendleton, with a considerable
force of marines, was marching 80
miles overland from Puerto Plato to
occupy Santiago and Levega.
DEDICATE BRIDGE
LK AUTOIOBUE TRIP
Marmarth, N. D., June 28.—Pouring
a quart of pure water over its steel
railing, little Dorothy Vandervoort for­
mally christened and opened for trav­
el the bridge across the Little Mis­
souri river at Marmarth. This bridge
removes the last serious obstacle for
travel over the entire length of the
Yellowstone trail from Plymouth Rock
to Puget sound.
A celebration of the event was car­
ried out despite the rain which fell
nearly all day. A roasted ox, 40 gal­
lons of coffee, all cooked at the bridge
formed the central part of the day's
feast. The Rhame band gave the mu­
sic.
President J. M. Parmley of the Yel­
lowstone Trail, association, made the
principal address.
This bridge has been the most pres­
sing need of the Yellowstone trail for
five years. It is a substantial steel
and concrete structure.

Every effort is being made ly the
United States war department officials
in charge of the mobilization of troops
to be'Bent to tire border, to send the
North Dakota regiment forward at the
earliest possible moment.
Telegrams urging haste followed
each other quickly yesterday after,
noon. Filling out of papers and the
preliminary work of mustering in was
nearly completed by night and the
regiment was awaiting the arrival of
the physician detailed from the regu­
lar army to make the final physical
examination before the militiamen be­
come United States soldiers.
Have Passed Examinations.
All of the boys have passed rigid
examinations by the various company
physicians and it is believed that
most of them will pass the tests of the
federal officer.
Orders have been received that if it
is impossible to have the men all ex­
amined immediately to send the
troops on anyway and to have them
examined while enroute. This indi­
cates that the war department has
confidence in the physical examina­
tions made by the regiment's own phy­
sicians.
None of the officers would predict
yesterday when the regiment would
be entrained, although the general
sentiment of the troops is that they
will not be at Camp Lincoln more
than ten days.
No Officers Mess.
Officers have established no special
mess. They take their meals with the
men, who eat while sitting on the
ground as they do when on the move.
Members of the machine gun com­
pany have 'been assigned to various
companies under war deportment or­
ders.
Sentiment among the troops Is of
the best. While a few of the men
may be homesick, the spirits are gen­
erally high and all are ready and will­
ing to go to the border and finish the
Mexicans.
Boys Have No Snap.
But the boys have -no snap. They
drill hard and fast, seven hours a day
and many, especially those from offic­
es, are lame and sore when night
comes.
But the band plays when they
march back to camp and they forget
the strenuous labor. Wrestling match­
es, boxing matches, medicine ball
games arid the evening band concerts
make the evenings attractive and
large crowds are at the camp every
night. Good natured banter about the
mahogany furniture shows how the
boys are entering into thp spirit of
camp life.
Major Henry's Battalion Drills.
Major Henry's battalion, consisting
of the Valley City, Fargo, Hillsboro
and Wahpeton companies, went
through held maneuvers yesterday af:
ternoon. Their open formation move­
ments showed a good grasp of the arts
of protecting themselves from the en­
emy. They advanced a few yards at
double^uick, laid down and fired and
repeated the movements, advancing
across the field. Major Henry has a
beautiful 'black charger that is a fav­
orite.
Company A now has more than 90
men. Capt. A. B. Welch is enthusias

YOUNG, PRATER AND

Yegen-Penwardcn and McCurdy-
Berndt Contests Very
Close
With thirty-four precincts to toe
heard from, it is impossible to give de­
cisive results on the county ticket at
this writing. Returns outside of Bis­
marck came in slowly. It was impos­
sible to get in touch with thirty-lour
precincts, either borause of wire trou­
ble due to yesterday's storm, or inac­
cessibility of polling places by wire.
The race for stiile senator is close.
If C. D. King maintains his present
load in the country in the thirty-four
precincts to be heard from, he will
be able to overcome 'Col. C. B. Little's
lead of 259. Country precincts went
solid for Mr. KiiiK. the Non-partisan
candidate, as they did for practically
every candidate endorsed by the far­
mers' organization.
There seems to be evidences of a
deliberate invasion of republican pri­
maries by democrats. In one precinct
practically every vole cast, was repub­
lican, although the poll lists show a
much smaller registered republican
vote.
Bismarck gave^t'ol.--Ltttl©731 fco -217

marck heard from gave King 353 to

The Non-partisan league house leg
islative ticket is running up with King
outside of L'ipniarck and if it main­
tains the present lead in country pi'p
cincts, the candidates may overcome
the lead of Young and Homan. Frank
G. Prater will be nominated, as he se­
cured" 316 votes in Bismarck and is
leading the ticket in the country pre
cincts. F'ollowing are total votes on
the legislative ticket in twenty pre­
cincts out of fifty-four heard from:
Young 698, Prater 646, Homan 524,
Blexrud 508, Bailey 487, Williams 462,

Richard Penwarden is leading for

and Mattis 212.
Keenan for register of deeds in the
20 precincts has 665 to Anderson's

The fight for states attorney is very
close. Berndt is leading in the 18
precincts, and may be able to increase
his lead over McCurdy. The incom­
plete returns are: E'erndt, 548 Mc­
Curdy, 537 Davies, 118.
B. O. Ward has a lead over Louis

RIC VOTE IN RURAL
Senator porter J. McCumber of Wahpeton has defeated Govj
ernor 13 Hanna for the Republican nomination for United!
States senator and, while Burdick is leading Frazier, his nomina­
is by no means sure, as the country vote is still to be heard
from. Severn storms over the entire state have paralyzed wires,
and made roads impassable at points.
The only assured results on the face of present returns is
the nomination of McCumber He is being supported generally,
by the farmers. Witli about one-fifth of the state heard from on
United States senator, the vote is as follows: McCumber, 8,173

Burleigh county in 19 precincts gives McCumber a majority
of 1210. Country precincts to be heard from will probably dou­
ble this lead.

Frailer Running .Strong.
With the rural precincts standing
solidly behind Frazier, Burdick in 490
precincts has a lead over the Noft-p*rt
isan candidate of only a little mora
than 1,600 votes. Most of the returnn
are from towns where Burdick natnr
ally polled his largest vote. Frazierfs
nomination is strongly indicated upon
the face of the returns.
Fraine is third man with 4,641 vote*
in 480 precincts. Frailer has 7,957
and Burdick 9,644.
The rest of the ticket is more or
less in doubt, with the exception ot
Thomas Hall and Carl Jorgenson.. In
this instance the Non-partisan league
backed their candidate, but in the case
of Kositzky the support seems to be
lacking.
Flint is holding his own over Hagan,
as is Walter Taylor, but a strong
country vote can easily overturn any
of the leads reported from scattering
precincts.
Linde is maintaining a strong lead
over Langer and indications are that
he may ibe renominated. In 215 pre­
cincts Linde has 4,527 to 3.9501 for
Langer. Other state results are shown
in the adjoining column.
Returns on the Non-partisan ballots
are very meagre. In 47 precincts Fisk,
Burke and Goss are leading. The far­
mers' candidates, Birdxell, Grace and
Robinson, however, are running strong
and have out-distanced Spalding and
Adamson. It looks as though Fisk,
Burke and Goss would oppose Birdtell,
Grace and Robinson at the primaries.
McDonald has slight lead over Hoover.
The returns indicate that the Non­
partisan league massed their efforts
on the governorship, supreme court
and legislative tickets.
