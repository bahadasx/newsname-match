[Krom The Tribune Bureau.'
Washington. June 28.?(ieneral Carranza ha? ordered the
release of the twentj-three American troopers held prisoner at
Chihuahua City.
Report? from the border to-night. drclaro thal the men have
already been taken from prison and placed aboard a heavily
armed train. on which they are being brought to Juares. They
are expected to reach there to-morrow and be turned ovrr to the
American authorities.
Carranza"--. comnliance with one of the dcmands of Secre?
tary Lansing*s note has thus tvertad the danger of an immedi
ate brcak with Mexieo. Although no official eonfirmation has
yet been received here. the relief in Administration circles was
unmistakable. Whether it wiil be axtything more than tempo?
rary could not be predicted to-nigh'.
Not until Carranza's reply, .inderstood to be m the way, is
received by Secretary Lansing will President WilsOB'fl course be
determined. It is believed now, however. that the President will
abandon his plan of prosenting the situation to Congress. Until
word nf the release of the prisoners was received it was under?
stood tha* this mij?ht be done to-morrow.
