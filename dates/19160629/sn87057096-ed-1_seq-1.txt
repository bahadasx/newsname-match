WAR SEEMS CERTAIN
Unless Mexican Government Backs
Down Hostilities will Begin.
Troops are Moving South.
Everything points to war with
Mexico, and it is thought in official
circles that the break will come to
day. President Wilson has demand
ed the immediate release of the
American soldiers who were captur
ed in the skirmish at Carrizal, and
unless they are released today is it
probable that an order will be given
to the United States troops to pro
ceed at once and release the men re
gardless of consequences. In every
state in the union the state militia
has been mobilized and already many
of them are on the way to the Mexi
can border. Before leaving the mo
bilization camps the men were re
quired to take the new federal oath,
which binds them for three years of
active service and three years in ..he
leserve.
The lowr troops which were mobil
ized at Camp Dodge near Des Moines,
are anout ready to depart for the
V-order and orders are expected at
any minute. There are now close to
4,000 men in camp, and then there is
the regiment of cavalry which is in
camp at North Liberty, and they will
go direct from that camp to the bor
der.
Nothing short of a complete back
down on the part of the Mexican
government can prevent war, and
hostilities will be apt to commence
before another issue of The Report
er is iTinted.
Autos Met Head On.
Guy Stark of this city had his
Hupp auto considerably smashed up
in a head on collision about three
miles northwest of Osceola last Sun
day evening, when he collided with a
Ford driven by a Mr. Hart who lives
6 miles northeast of Osceola. In the
car with Mr. Stark was his sister-in
law, Mrs. J. H. Pilmer, and her neice,
Miss Velma Pilmer, of Norwalk, and
Mr. Stark's little son Paul, the two
children being in the rear seat. As
they were enroute to New Virginia
they rounded, a rather sharp bend
where the road was pretty narrow,
Mr. Stark being on the right side of
the road when they met the Ford
which was on the wrong side making
the swing for the turn. The cars
were only going about fifteen miles
an hour, but as Guy saw the other
fellow was making no effort to get
back on the proper side of the road
lie turned his car in an effort to avoid
a collision and at the same moment
the driver of the Ford made the turn
,and their crashed together, fortu
nately none of the occupants of eith
er car were injured aside from little
Paul Stark, who sustained a black
eye. Mr. Stark's car was consider
ably damaged, the front axle and
fenders being badly bent and the
radiator broken, and the front of the
Ford was also badly smashed up, but
all parties congratulated themselves
on the fact that none "of the occu
pants were killed or injured. Mrs.
Stark and Mrs. Pilmer had exchanged
places a couple of miles back, Mrs.
Stark riding with Mr. Pilmer in his
car which was following and Mrs.
Pilmer riding with Mr. Stark.
Rev. Jacobs Will Preach Farewell
Sermon Next Sunday.
Rev. B. Frank Jacobs, who has
been pastor of the Leon Presbyter
ian church for several years, and
who placed his resignation in the
hands of the church some months
ago, will preach his farewell sermon
on next Sunday. He has no definite
plans for the future, but expects to
remain in the ministry, but will make
an extended visit at his old home in
Ohio before again taking up pastoral
work. During his residence in Leon
Rev. Jacobs has made many friends
in this city, both in his congregation
and with our citizens generally, who
regret to see him leave. A call has
been extended to Rev.ttl S. Marsolf,
of New Sharon, Iowa, by the Leon
church, and he will take up his work
as pastor in Leon about September 1.
Lineville S—leoii 3.
The Leon base ball team met their
second defeat this season last Sunday
when they lost the game played at
Lineville to the Lineville team by a
score of 6 to 3. Quite a number of
fans from Leon attended the game
and say they have a fellow named
Miller over there who can knock the
ball clear out of sight. His batting
was what won the game for Lineville.
War Will Cause Printers More Grief.
If war with Mexico actually begins
it means more grief for the newspa
per publishers. With the supply of
print paper the lowest for many
years, the prices soaring out of
sight, and with the big increase in
the sale of daily papers which would
come with actual war, the outlook
is anything but promising.
Grocery Stores Will Close July 4th.
All the grocery stores in Leon have
signed, an agreement to close their
stores on Monday evening, July 3rd,
and not open them at all until Wed
nesday morning, July 5th. Their
patrons are Requested to take notice
and not try to buy groceries on July
4th.

cers of the Leon Rebekah lodge on

TO
ROOSEVELT AGAIN* DECLINES.
Letter Tells Why He Refuses Moose
Nomination and Urges Progres
sives to Support Hughes.
Roosevelt issued his letter to the
progressive republican national com
mittee Monday, in which he positive
ly declined to head the Bull Moose
presidential ticket, and urges his fol
lowers to support the republican can
didate, Hughes. He says President
Wilson has been tried and found
wanting, and with two republican
tickets in the field Wilson would be
rfe-elected. The progressive national
conimittee voted 152 to 9 not to fill
the vacancy at the head of their tick
et. Much harsh language was in
dulged in at the meeting. Col. John
M. Parker, of Louisiana,, nominated
by the Bull Moosers for vice presi
dent is left as a candidate on a tick
et without a head. Whether he will
decline the nomination for vice presi
dent, or decide to remain on the
ticket will be decided after he re
turns home. Many Moosers will
swallow Hughes, and support the re
publican ticket, but all over the
country are scores who will refuse to
be.betrayed, and will no doubt vote
for President Wilson.
Democratic County Convention.
The democrats of Decatur county,
will meet in delegate convention as
provided by law, at the opera house

ten alternates to attend the demo
cratic state convention at Des Moines
on July 12th, to nominate candidates
for any office on tho county ticket
where there is a vacancy, to select
senatorial and congressional commit
teemen, and to transact any other
business which may properly come
before the convention.
At the close of the county con
vention the township committeemen
selected at the primary election, will
meet for the purpose of organizing
the county committee and to trans
act such other business as may come
before them.

Almost $1,000 For a Load of Wool,
J. W. Walton, of southeast of Leon,
on Monday delivered the highest
priced load of wool ever sold, we be
lieve, in Decatur founty. Mr. Wal
ton had 435 sheep, 280 western
which he bought at Omaha last fall
and 165 natives raised on his farm.
He received a total of $929.34 for the
clip selling the wool to E. W. Salmon
a buyer from Grant City, Mo., who
paid him 32 cents per pound for the
western and 35 cents per pound for.i
the native fleeces. It was a pretty
big load of wool and*- brought Mr.
Walton a good sized check, notwith
standing the republican theory that
free wool would destroy the sheep in
dustry in the United States.
Methodist Conference in Session.
The Methodist district conference
opened at the M. E. church in this
city yesterday for a two day session,
and more than a hundred ministers,
laymen and their wives are expected

Leon to provide rooms and breakfast
for the visitors and dinner and sup
per will be served both days in the
dining room of the cliurcn by the
Ladies Guild of the Leon church.
Will Raise Wild Ducks.
Deputy game warden George Myers
last week received from the state
game preserve at Des Moines, a set
ting of wild duck eggs. They are
mallard and canvass back eggs, and
Mr. Myers has them under a good old
hen and in a couple of weeks expects
to have a flock of young wild ducks.
After they are hatched he will re
move the first joint of their wings so
they cannot fly.
Death of France Hamilton.
France M. Hamilton, one of the
oldest settlers of Decatur county died
at his home a few miles southeast of
Davis City Sunday evening, his death
following an illness of about three
weeks. Funeral services were held
Tuesday morning at 10 o'clock at
River View church, interment being
in the Hamilton cemetery. We trust
we will be furnished with data for
an obituary for our next issue.
Leon Will Have a Quiet Fourth.
it will be worse than Sunday in
Leon on July 4th, for practically all
of the stores in the city will be closed
all day in order to give their em
ployes a holiday. The grocers, dry
goods houses, barber shops and other
business houses will not be opened at

other towns and numerous picnic
parties are being planned.

Excelling All Other .June Records by
Over 10%—July 1th Set For
the Rig Frolic.
J. W. Hurst& Co. made the propo
sition to the store force that if they
would incret.se the June sale record
1 0 poi' cent that the firm would bear
the entire expense of a day's outing
on Grand River.
I The 10 per cent increase is already
assured and as a result the Hurst
store will be closed all day July 4th
and the whole jolly force will enjoy
a well earned holiday.
Mr. John Hurst plans to come from
Chicago to help them celebrate and
see just how the trick was done.
The patrons of this popular store
will be glad to know of the good
time their favorite clerko are to have
and help this yearly movement along
by doing their shopping either the
clay before or the day after the
Fourth.
A Slight Advance in Advertising
Rates.
Owing to the enormous increase in
the cost of everytning connected with
the printing business, print paper
.having advanced more than 100 per
I cent in the last few months, newspa
pers all over the country are com
pelled to increase their subscription
and advertising rates. The Reporter
has held off as long as possible, and
while we have not yet made any ad
vance in subscription, we are com
pelled to make a slight advance in
advertising rates. Commencing July
1st the rates for display advertising
will be 12Vs cents per inch to adver
tisers who have spaco in each issue
during the year, and 15 cents per
inch to all who do not have an ad
vertisement every week. This is how
ever a lower rate than the papers in
other towns in southern Iowa, with
smaller circulation than The Report
er, are now charging.
Samples of Hay and Alfalfa Must Be
Eight Inches in Diameter.
We made an error last week in an
nouncing the conditions for the prizes
which A. M. Pryor will pay to the
boys of Decatur county for samples of
blue grass, timothy, red clover and
alfalfa, to be used as a part of the
exhibit from Decatur county at the
Iowa State Fair, stating that the
samples must measure eight inches
around at the band, when it should
have read eight inches in diameter
at the band, which makes quite a dif
ference. Mr. Pryor will give a prize
of $1.00 for the best bunch of blue
grass, timothy, red clover and alfalfa
brought to him by a Decatur county
boy not over ten years of age. The
blue grass and alfalfa must be
brought to his office not later than
July 1st, and the timothy and red
clover not later than July 10th.
Kicked a Steer anil ltroke His Toe.
Mike Griffin, the genial Irishman
of southeast of Leon, who is an ex
tensive stock raiser, had a set-to with
an obstreperous steer last Friday, and
came out second best. The steer did
not want to go where Mike insisted
he should, and Mike very gently kick
ed the steer on the jaw, but the re
sult was not what he expected and he
is nursing a broken toe as the result
of the impact. MiKe will use a club
the next time he tries to turn a steer.

TWENTYFIVE YEARS AGO
Items Taken from the files of The

The worst storm that has visited
Leon for a long time was the one of
yesterday afternoon. The rainfall
was enormous and it hailed so that
the ground was white. A heavy

burning out all the plugs at the sta

A guy wire run from the pole to
within a few feet of J. A. Harris &

was the shock that Charlie Hebener

a drama that reaches the climax of
woman's devotion will be presented.
Pauline Frederick, one of the fore
most emotional artists of the Ameri
can stage, who achieved a great per
sonal triumph in her initial motion
picture characterization in the Fa
mous Players Film Company's superb
pliotft-spectacle, "The Eternal City,"
returns to the screen in an overpow
eringly dramatic photo-production of
"Sold" the great drama of woman's
devotion, adapted from the Russian
of George Erastov. As the wife of
the poor artist, who poses for his
successful rival in order to obtain
funds for her husband, who detects
and misjudges her, Miss Frederick is
completely overwhelming in the in
tensity and strength of her portray
al. This stirring five part photoplay
will make an indelible impression on
the minds of all who witness it.
On Monday, July 3rd, the seven
reel Red Seal play "The Rosary" with
Kathlyn Williams heading the cast
will be shown. The following is a
synopsis of the play:
Bruce Wilton has amassed a for
tune which he lavishes on his wife,
Vera.
Their household is a liappy one but
into it creeps a note of menace. No
one hears it at first, save Father Kel
ly, a priest, the former tutor of
Bruce. Quietly he goes to Avork,
with his sharpened mental sense to
find the person who is causing the
adverse influence in the household.
Almost on the verge of discovering
the cause, calamity descends on
Bruce Wilton. His fortune is swept
away and in such a manner that he
believes that his wife was the cause
of his ruift.
Husband and wife are separated,
the home is destroyed, and yet the
cause of all this disaster is unknown.
But Father Kelly, with the faith
that moves mountains, goes on quiet
ly, serenely, confidently, with but one
purpose in view, the happiness of
those he loves.
He solves the mystery and lets the
white light of truth into the minds of
those that have been darkened by
evil.
More than this, he finds the one
who has caused all the misery and
restores the home.
Matinees at 3 o'clock, first evening
shows at Y:15. Prices 10 and 15
cents.
