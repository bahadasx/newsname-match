^Actual Start was Quietly Made and
was Seen By Comparatively
Few People
For a brief time today Fairmont was an important point
upon the military map of the United States, for militia
companies from Morgantown and Littleton were brought
here preparatory to being sent on to Clarksburg where
most of First regiment companies will be concentrated be
fore being sent over the Coal and Coke road through
1 Weston and Burnsville to Camp Kanawha near the capital
of the state.
The local companies moved from their armory on Jack
son street to the station about 1:30 o'clock and the Balti
more and Ohio railroad was prepared to send forward the
train at 2:30 o'clock.
The march to the station was in-striking contrast with
?the send off that was planned for them last night. With
out a single drum beat and almost in silence the men mov
ed out Cleveland avenue to Main and down Main to Mad
ison. The word had gone about pretty generally that they
would leave at about the time they did and there was more
.??than the usual number of people in the center of the town
!K at the time, but the trip to the railroad was almost en
tirely devoid of demonstration on the part of the public.

PARADE WHEN
PLANSCHANGE
Were Enthusiastically Greet
ed by Thousands of
Fairmonters.
Thanks to a sudden add late change
in the plans made at the offtco of the
Adjutant General the members or the
National Guard of West Virginia who
belong to Companies *H jnd I were
given two public farewells, and the
3ne tendered last night partook of the
nature of a municipal display of pa*
triotism as well as an expression of
good will for the boys Mho are about
:o leave on what may be an extreme
ly serious tour of.duty with the flag.
When It became known that Adju
tant General Bond had countermand
ed the order for the First regiment to
leave last night for the concentration
camp the preparations made at the in*
stance of Mayor Bowen to give the
guardsmen a rousing, seijd-off were so
far advanced that it was decided to
turn the affair into a street.parade
which would enable the'people of Fair
mont to get a good look at the youth
ful wearers of the State's uniform
whch they are soon, to change for that
of the nation
It has been a long time since a
crowd of equal size has'-lined Main
street and Fairmont' avenue. This
crowd assembled a full hour before
the little column led by Mayor Bowen
in an automobile made it's appearance.1,
There probably were as many men in'
the throngs as there were women but
the smart summer frocks, the bright
colored sweaters and light coats tfhich
the women wore gave~the" whole pic
ture an air of being made up largely
of tho fairer sex.
The people who lined the curbs
Df the center of the^city arid covered
tho elevated lawns along Fahlnont
avenue were intensely Interestd in
the parade and tho lde$It represented,
but at flrst thci-e was not much t^emon*
3tration It was not long after the
column swung Into Main street, how
iver,; before a ripple of applause was
I'nrJM and thereafter the paraders
;arcl:ol ilfnost continuously between
-olid rows of hand clapping people
The parade was led by Mayor Bow
en and his staff in an automobile. This
was-followed by a platoon of police
and three bands. T*h$n ,came the

Emotion Too Much For One
? -Man Anxious to
Join.
Joseph A. Harrington, corporal in
company H, was the only local Guards
man -who leaves a weeping war
bride behind him. Corporal Harring
ton and Miss Arlie Pearl Teagardcn
of Mannington, were united in mar
rlgae at eleven o'clock this morning
by Rev. W. J. Eddy at the Baptist
church parsonage. Mrs. Harrington
will return to her homo and await the
letters from her husband.
The bride and groom were allowed
to take dinner together at noon today
but at one o'clock Corporal Harring-!
ton fell into line with his company and
marched away. His bride with her
friends accompanied the Guard to the I
station for'the last sight of her hus
band, perhaps for many months.
Many others of the local guard mem-1
bers leave behind them young wives
and widowed mother*. All the com-i
missioned officers with the exception 1
of Lieut - Linger are married. Ser
gent Lcsterr Sherrard of Cofnpany I
has beon married but a short time, and
Wayne Forman is another of the
young benedicts. Ray Arnett of com
pany H leaves a widowed mother with
his wife and small child at home.
Corporal R. G. Conaway of company H
is another who leaves a young wifo.
W. L. Donald of company I leaves a
wife and small child.
In practically every instance each of
the boys who left today had wives or
mothers "or sisters who visited them
at the prmory this morning and accom
panied'them to the train this, after*
noon. Many of the. women: could not
suppress their grief at seeing their
loved boys- leaving and gave way to
outbursts of tears at the'station. Even
older and hardened men were com
pelled tb turn their heads to hide the
tears that como with - that strange
"lump in the throat" feeling as they
saw their nons marching away to un
known destinies.
Three of the Corporals in company I
are brothers, .these, are Charles, Jo
seph an?l tVayne Watson. These boys
this mcrrilcg turned over V to their
mother al c'he savings they had in
the, back. "Xpjorc rul. t^ro crowd at the

Race for Big Prizes Grows
Warmer as End Draws Nigh
The race for the $3,200 in- prizes
which will be distributed free among
the members of the West Virginian's
7,000 Club is growing warmer and
warmer as the time draws near for
the close of tho campaign. With all
candidates within easy distance of tne
top, it is hard to tell Just who are most
likely to be at the lead when the end
finally comes. ? \ r ' w
Somo of the members who have the
qualities necessary to make a win
ning race, are falling behind, because
of their lack of persistence. Others,
who are not'so well blessed with?en
ergy and enthusiasm, and hustle, prt
plugging ' ahead,', and are very likely
to gain the .lead at the close through
sheer determination and WILL- POW

District No. 2 still looks like the
strongest of . the two'territories, but
you never can tell, for some hustler
may arise in the first,district and com
pletely Hurn the tables before the last
day arrives. It is anybody's race as

Some are inclined to lay back in the
I harness and llfure that it Is too late
and win one of the big prizes. Some
who loafed at the start have lost all
hope. But the wise ones won't lose
hope, but keep going strong right up
until tho last minute. It is not yet
too late to 'start a winning race.' Tha
major contest ,wiir be'foiignt out dui*
