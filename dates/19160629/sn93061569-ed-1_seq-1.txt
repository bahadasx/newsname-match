ROOSEVELT WILL LEND
HUGHES ASSISTANCE
Progressive Leader Declares
Third Party Can't Win.
Hughe
íes Platform Is
Endorsed
Chicago, June 2G. Theodore Roose
velt in a letter read to the progres
s!ve national committee in session here
today, finally declined to accept the
presidential nomination of the party,
and strongly urged the bull moose or
ganization to support Charles E.
Hughes. Questions which confronted
the committee were: Shall a third par
ty ticket be put in the field ? Shall
Hughes be substituted for Roosevelt
on the progressive ticket or shall
Hughes be endorsed? Shall the com
mittee refuse to endorse any candi
date? Shall the progressive party or
ganization be continued?
The committee decided against open
ing the session to newspaper men by
a- vote of 35 to 15. John M. Farker
led the fight for an open session. Coo.
V. Perkins advocated a closed session,
at least for a time.
At the executive session Chester H.
Rowell of California, Raymond Robins
of Illinois and James R. Garfield of
Ohio related to the committee the im
pressions they had formed at a con
ference with Mr. Hughes in New York.
The committee then decided to make
the meeting an open one, and the 15
members who withdrew when the re
port on Mr. Hughes' views was start
ed, including John M. Parker return
ed. William Flinn of Pennsylvania mov
ed that Colonel Roosevelt's declination
be accepted. The motion was carried
by acclamation, without an objecting
vote.
Catron Forges Ahead
"The latest indications throughout
the state, especially as reflected by the
state press, make it appear that our
well known and able senator T. B. Cat
ron, is forging ahead of his competit
ors, Messrs. Hubbell and Andrews.
With the experience that Catron has
in matters of national importance, and
particularly with those of our state, it
will not be bad to return him to the
legislative halls of the nation to look
after our interests.
"It is the truth that Hubbell would
also be a goon man to represent us
in the national senate hut at the same
time we believe that he is some what
eccentric in political matters, and we
ought to consider this when we choose
one of our citizens for such an exalted
position as Senator of the .United
States.
"While we haven't anything against
the gentleman from Bernalillo Coun
; ly, at the same time we believe that
our state should be represented by a
man of the strongest character and of
the most respected personality. Let
us send a man who will fill the sena
torial shoes, and hot one whom they
will fit losely. Tierra Amarilla New
State.
Public Land Commissioner Ervien,
accompanied by John March, nution
eer, Mateo Lujan and Luis Lujan, all

cently advertised in The Citizen. Geo.
Emblem acted as chauffeur for the
party. Mr. Lujan was a former prom
inent stockman in Union county, but
has been a resident of Santa Fe several
years past. "Bob" Ervien always has
a host of friends Who are glad to see
him when ever he returns to the "old
town" because ie, too, used to be one
of our representative residents.
CALL FOR RECRUITS
Sheriff T. J. Crumley received" the
following telegram from Gov. McDon
ald yesterday morning:
"Must have recruits for militia to
fill regiment. See prominent citizens
and move quick. It is due the state,
the nation and we owe it to the boys
who are already at the front. It must
be done immediately. How many can
you get in 3 days. Act now. Answer
my expense.
Jerónimo Aragón, is reported to have
enlisted up to this Vime.
PURCHASERS
OF PUBLIC LAND
IN UNION COUNfY
The folowing is a list of the pur
chases of public land made Tuesday
morning at the court house. The sale
wat a very tame affair and most of
the land sold at the appraised value,
there being only two tracts that were
raised. R. P. Ervien, New Mexico
Public Land Commissioner, personally
conducted the sale, assisted by the
State auctioneer, John March. A
large crowd was present and a num
ber of people came from all parts of
the county to attend but owing to
weather conditions, the enthusiasm
was nothing to what was expected.
Some of the land sold is very fine for
farming purposes.

CLAYTON WILL CONTEST
CLASSY AGGREGATION
Fast Battles Expected Friday
and Saturday. Crowd Will
Fight Dalhart Fourth
and Fifth '
Manager George promises fans two
of the fastest games of the season
Friday and Saturday when Clayton
meets the fast Tcxhoma bunch here.
This aggregation comes, we under
stand, with many scalps in it3 belt.
Advertising announces the games call
ed at 2:30. Waters will probably go
on the slab for Clayton the first day.
The Fourth of July card promises
to be interesting when the locals will
meet their old enemy, Dalhart, for a
two day bout at Dalhart. Beside the
games the1 windy city promises visit
ors all they can eat at a bij free bar
becue together with many side attrac
tions including a wrestling match be
tween Chas. Delivuk, oí Wichita, who
has never been pinned to the mat by
any man of his weight and Jack Ingle,
who has lost 9 of 292 matches.
Clayton Wins From Dalhart
Before a crowd of more than 200
fans the Clayton bunch in a melo-dra-matic
wind-up trimmed Dalhart, its
first and only real adversary Friday
afternoon by a score of 4 to 3.
Things looked dark for Clayton in the
last half of the ninth with two down
and the fans leaving the grounds. Mor
ton and Hatchett both went down Mn
the first half of the final session with
the. score 3:2 for Dalhart. Clark got
a clean hit. Brown rolled one down
the third base line. Page, twirler for
the visitors waited for the ball to roll
"foul" but it didn't. He waited too
long. Brown was making it to first in
nothing flat. Page threw ten feet over
iirst and Clark came home tieing the
score. Fred Wight, playing his first
game of the season came up. He
whiffed at the first one. Page sailed
one over that looked good and Fred
rapped it for a perfect hit and Brown
drifted home making the winning
score.
The last inning was the principle
feature of the game although there
was enough interest in all the nine in
nings to satisfy everybody.
Brown started the gome but was re
placed by Morton in the fourth. Hon
ors for hitting went to the Clayton
lads. v'
Texline Easy Victims
Texline fell an easy victim to the
wiles of Waters, Clayton's new south
paw. The score was 14 to 2. The
game was not close enough to be very
interesting but some 200 fans stuck to
the finish.
AS SEEN FROM THE BI EECHERS
Clayton's banking institutions fur
nish a goodly share of the baseball
timber for Clayton's now ranid aggre
gation. Of course there are only two
"regulars" from the banks now in the
lineup, H. C. McFadden, the fleet-footed
center and Hardy Kerr the de
pendable shortstop and there is Um
pire Clark whose services have be
come pretty much in demand. Then in
a pinch three more players can be re
cruited, Chester Kiser, Robert Ham
lin and J. H. Gregg.
We hope it is not going to be neces
sary to mention in this column that
the people of Clayton are subscribing
their money to the Clayton team for
just one purpose, that purpose being
for the player to Play Ball and not
to make speeches.
We want to reserve this column for
the happy side of the game.
It is not without regret that the
stories of game find Clayton's old
twirler, Bill Lynch on the opposing
line-up. However he is faring very
well, inasmuch as he has a good
berth with the Dalhart crew.
W. R. Brown, formerly at the head
of the Durango, Colo., team and late
of Dawson, N. M., left this week to
uccept his old job as coach of Durango
bovs. Brown worked in a couple of
ames for Clayton. From observa
tions of him he is not a grand-stand
player. He works quietly and good
naturedly. He came here as a pitch
er and while he perhaps did not show
nil the twirling ability the local fans
demand they all agree that he knows
the game, and is dependable most any
where and has the knack of hiding the
sore spot when distressing errors or
plain bone-head plays try the patience
of players and spectators alike.
This column has watched the work
f Mattox. lie is another boy who
readily makes friends with fans who
know the game. His line of talk from
third, to his team mates throughout
the varied fortunes of the game puts
big league life in it. On the field he
works fast and clean and knows what
to do with the ball when he get3 it. He
hits good and runs bases the same
way.
Howard Moore threatens to shake
the injury and get back in the game.
Besides playing, Moore's luck is awj1-
inspiring to say the least.
To our notion Fred Wight should be
reserved as a pinch hitter against
Page of Dalhart. Surely the sight of
Fred should give Page the buck after
what happened Friday.
Big Bob continues to be the Water
loo for pitchers.
Manager George wished an nwful
place on Clayton folks in which spend
the Fourth. But Luther says it was
the best he could do when he matched
two games with Dalhart for the
Fourth and Fifth. Hence there is
nothing to do but everybody go along
and, root the home team to victory.
Twirler Watters and infielder Miller,
late of the Cheyenne Indians arrived
Saturday evening. Although the giyne
Sunday in which they worked was
hardly a test, both showed up well.

CAPT. MOREY, WOUNDED
ESCAPES TO U. S. LINES
Tell Story of Carrizal Fight
and Bravery of American
Troopers. Carranza Will
Release Prisoners
Field Headquarters, Mexico, June '
27, by Wireless to Columbus, N. M.
American negro troopers faced almost
certain death at Carrizal with smiles
in their eyes and slang on their lips
and they burst into song once or
twice as they fought their grim fight
against odds. This was the story told
by Captain Lewis S. Morey when he
arrived at field headquarters today.
For fortyMive minutes the men
fought, joking among themselves all
t::c wnile, e.n though they; valued
we ha 1 been trapped and had little
chance of getting out alive," he said.
Captain Morey said he had never
seen such valor as was displayed by
f'aptain Charles T.'Boyd in leading a
handful of dismounted skirmishers
through the machine gun fire nnd into
the ambush of death. He added that
it was not until their ammunition was
exhausted that the troop wasfimilly
cut to pieces, and he told of the heroic
death of Lieutenant Hanry R- Adair of
Portland, Ore., in an attempt to re
plenish it.
Adair DUi Fighting
Lieutenant Adair died lighting, his
hat words being "Go on, Sergeant" to
a non-commissioned officer at his side,
Captain Morey said. The two were
on their way to the pack animals car
rying the ammunition when they wero
intercepted near a small irrigation
ditch by a detail of Mexicans.
Lieutenant Adair hud already been
wounded and ha I lost his pistol in the
previous fighting, but he had borrow
ed another and vas lighting a hand-to-hand
battle when he was killed. Ha
fell backward, unconscious, and was
caught by the negro Sergeant as he
slid toward the ditch, which was deep
ly filled with .water. " The Sergeant
held Adair in his arms, his face above
the water until he died, the wounded
officer reviving only long enough to i
whisper orders to leave him and finish
the mission.
Captain Morey said that Captain
Boyd warned the men before the fight
that they were advancing into the
greatest danger. He reiterated that
the Carranzistas opened fire first from
their machine gun trench, nnd assert
ed that almost immediately afterward
a detachment of the Mexicans circled
to the rear and dnive. off numbers of
the American horses, which a few men
had been left to. hold, while the caval
rymen dismounted in line of skirmish.
The size of the battlefield nnd the
cover from which the Mexicans fought
made it necessary for his troop and
that of Captain Boyd to separate nnd
fight what were practically individual
engagements, Captain Morey said.
Woodmen Unveil Monument
The monument, erecteM at the Adobe
School house in memory of George
Hensley'his brother Woodmen, was un
