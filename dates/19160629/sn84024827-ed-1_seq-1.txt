GROSSLY INVADED
Case Of Petrolite, Shelled In
Mediterranean Last Decem
ber; Threatens Breach With
Austria
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. June 28. The
American rejoinder to Austria regard
ing the Austrian submarine attack on
the American steamer PetiOlite, made
piiblic today by the state department
describes tlu act as "a deliberate in
sult to the flap of the I'nited States
and an invasion of the rights of
American citizens" and requests
prompt apology, punishment of the
submarine commander and payment
of indemnity.
Prompt Amende Expected.
In vigorous language the commun
i'atirm sent a week ago today, makes
it clear that the I'nited States gov
rnr.ienl e"ievei the fats of the
case entirely different from what the
Austrian submarine commander re
ported them to be. and that immediate
amends are to be expected.
The Austrian claim that the Petro
lite's captain voluntarily gave up sup
plies taken from the steamer by the
submarine commander is flatly con
tradicted, as ' are the claims that
warring shots were fired across the
Petrolite's bow before she was shelled
and that her appearance was such us
tv justify the submarine commander
in mistaking her for a cruiser.
Case Lcng Pending.
The attack the Petrolite, a
Standard Oil tanker, occurred in the
Mediterranean, December 5. A pro
test sent soon afterwards on prelimin
ary reports from the tanker's captain
and crew bi'Jught the Austrian com
munication to which the new Ameri
can note replies.
The rejoinder. whi h is in the form
of a memorandum from Secretary
lnsing to Ambassador Penfield at
Vienna is in nart as follows:
Partial Text of Note.
"Evidence obtained from the cap
tain and members of the crew of the
steamer. Petrolite and from examina
tion made of the vessel under direc
tion of the navy department con
vinces thia government that the Aus-tro-Hungarian
government has ob
tained an incorrect report of the at
tack on the s'enmer. With particu
lar reference to the examination made
by the foreign office the following in
formation briefly has been offered:
"No shot was fired across the bow
of the steamer as a signal to stop.
When the first shot was fired the
captain was under the impression that
an explosion had taken place in th'j
engine room. Not until the second
shot was fired did the captain and
crew sight the submarine which was
ns'ern of the steamer and they posi
tively assert that neither the first
nor the second shot was fired across
'he bow of the vessel.'
Contradicts Austria.
"The steamer did not swing around
in a course directed toward the sub
marine. :s aMesed in the repoit made
by the Austrian-Hungarian govern-i-ient.
but the captain at once stopped
the engines and swung the vess;l
broadside to the submarine and at
right angles to the course to show
neutral marl-hits, which was mani
festly the reasonable and correct
course to follow.
"The submarine commander admits
that the steamer stopped her engines.
The captain of the Petrolite denies
that the vessel was ever headed to
watd the submarine and theexplana
tion of the steamer made by a naval
neineer constructor corroborates this
statement, because, as he states, the
shell which took effect, striking the
deck house which surrounds the
smokestack, was fired from a point
45 degrees from the starboard bow.
This was one of the last shots fired
and indicates that the ship was not
headed toward the submarine, even
up to the tim the submarine ceased
firing.
The submarine fired approximately
12 shots The majority of the shots

Troops Be Unhampered In
Pursuit Of Bandits
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Juu- 28. An im
mediate break between the I'niteil
States anil the tie facto government
of Mexico has been averted by com
pliance with the American demand
for release of the twenty three troop
ers captured in the tight at Carrizal.
Whether a state of war has been
prevented Or merely postponed no one
here would attempt to say tonight.
Oilicial information as to the attitude
of General Carranza was lacking. I'n
til his response to Secretary Lansing'
note, despatched Sunday, making
two peremptory and distinct de
mands, it received, there will be no
decision on whether President Wilson
shall lay the crisis before Congress.
Relief at Washington.
News of the release of the prisoners,
received early tonight in the pret-a
dispatches. biOught undisguised relief
to hUh officials. It was accepted as
correct, although no announcement
had come through official sources.
MortOver. it wa assumed that Car

tit., t ii -I t (n itrHpuil tlw. -ji.
tnred i-avalrjmcu starlet for the bur
der without waiting for his announce
ment of the action to reach Washing
ton. More Concessions Demanded.
While it generally is conceded that
this move lessens tension, and makes
the crisis less imminent, no one iOu
versant with the grave problem is
losing sight of the fact that the all
important question of Carranza's at
titude towards the American soldiers'
right to protect the territory and
citizens of the I'nited States frotj
hnmtil iiitr.ii.w ii 11 rwtf lAil Tt. it ff-
facto government stands upon Ihe or
ders to General Trevino to attiilc
General Pershing's men when they
n.ote other than toward the border. '
the situation is actually just what it
was b-lore.
The fact that Carranza has complied
with one of the demands is accepted
by the more optimistic officials here
as an indication that he is striving
to prevent a break. Ken though he
again should attempt to place a'l
blame for the Carrizal fight upon the
American officers nd insist upon his
rights to forcibly oppose any except
northward movements of American
troops, it is thought that possibly he
will state his position in such a man
ner as to make no further discussion
necessary.
Dining any negotiations, however,
the I'nited States will insist upon
freedom of movement Of troops in
Mexico and in any attempt to inter
fere with them will be met by such
fort;e as Is necessary. Thi is ap
plicable to any period of delay ot
casOned by attempting to arraue
mediation or arbitration.
Mediators Again Busy.
The possibility of Latin-America
offers of mediation in the cirsis again
was widely discussed tonight. Ignat '-S
Calderon. minister from Bolivia, will
make a second call upon Secretary
Lansing tomorrow to .discuss the sub
ject. He will endeaOr to ascertain
for the benefit of himself and bis
collesues whether tender of good of
fices by the South and Central Ameri
can republics would be entertained at
this time. The minister said after
his first conference with Secretary
Lansing On Monday, that he tinder
stood the I'nited States to be unwill
ing even to discuss the subject of
mediation or arbitration whi'e the
captured American troopers remained
in custody.
Powers Influence Carranza.
It is known that powerful influences
have been brought to bear on Carran
za in the last few days to make bint
at least turn over the American prison
ers. Prominent Mexicans In the
I'nited States-as 'well as America!
bankers amt business Interests with
influence in Mexican affairs have
flooded the first chief with telegrams.
They all sent him the same warning
that the I'nited States meant business,
that to hold the prisoners would mean
