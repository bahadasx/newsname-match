- Autoa VVithout Tags.
'Automobiles without license
tags are by. no means uncommon
upon the f-treets of Meade.
This is a direct violation of the
law, and the state employs a
numberof "spotters ''whose duty
it is to locate such violaters. ' If
you have a license tag-, you bet
ter have it on your car; if not
it would be a good idea to apply
for one at once, the spotter may
appear upon the scene at any
moment and ""catch you nap
ping". A word of warning to
the wise should be sufficient.

Notes From Topeka
Perhaps the busiest man in
Topeka these days is Ad jt. Genl.
C. I. Martin. His office is a ver
itable bee hive. - '
On Friday several companies
of National Guards came to To
peka and were at once attached
to a Union Pacific train for Ft.
Riley The gathering of people
at the .depots to see the boys ar
rive and leave was large. The
Yates Center company, one from
Independence, one from Fredonia
and one from Humbolt came in
on a Santa Fe special and left for
the mobilization camp at Riley.
Things certainly have a war
look. Battery A, the only artil
lery company in the state is ex
pected to entrain for Mexico
City. Their band left for Ft,
Riley, Friday. The Artillery
force cn the border is already
sufficient There are many scenes
that remind one of the long ago
in the parting of families, youcg
wives and mothers who cling to
their soldier husbands with one
child in arms and older ones
clinging to their soldier fathers
who are leaving good paying jobs
to respond to the call of their
country. Indeed many ure the
hearts that are hoping today that
something will happen that their
boys, -their husbands will not
have to go farther than Ft Riley.
We have so often been reminded
of the day our boys left Meade
for the Philippines, and of the
one who did not return with the
living.
Meade county was represented
in the class of eighty five who
took the examination for admis
sion to the bar this last week.
Charles Chester-Wilson was the
second name that was called and
your correspondent was inform
ed by members of the examining
committee he passed a very cred
itable examination and they pre
dicted that Mr. Wilson would
rise in his profession judging
from the careful manner he pro
ceeded when his list of questions
were given him each day the
clear and concise manner in
which each question was ans
wered. Gen. O. R. Stevens was a visit
or at the Commander of the G.
A R. Dept. of Kansas office
Thursday and Friday of last
week. They were wishing that
Hon. F. S. Sullivan would drop
Departed
An accident, which cost the life
of a little child, occurred the first
of the week, at the home of Mr.
and Mrs, Roy Dobbins, . near
Copelaad, Kansas. A team,
hitched to a wagon was standing
in the corral. Two of the Dob
bins children, a girl aged four
and a boy aged two, being ac
customed to horses and unafraid,
of tbem climbed into it The team
was a young one and the pres
ence of the children ia the wag
on frightened them. As they
ran around the corral, the little
boy, Leroy" Carey, was thrown
over the' dashboard onto the
double trees, and finally to the
ground. Before help could arrivt
to rescue him the wheels had
passed over his body and death
followed within an hour.
The remains were brought to
the. home of Mrs. Dobbins' aunt,
Mrs. Peter Specht. south of
Meade, where the funeral ser
vices were held Wednesday af
ternoon at 2 o'clock, conducted
by Rev S. M. Hunt of the M. E.
church, and interment was made
in Graceland Cemetery.
Raj' Millman, formerly editor
of The Liberal News, was in the
city last Saturday. From all ac
counts Ray seems to be going
from bad to worse he's in poli
tics now running for Register
of Deeds of Seward county, via
the Republican route. It is our
guess that he wins.
Mrs. C. J. Spiers, who had
been visiting relatives and
friends at Great Bend, Lyons,
and bodge City Kansas, returned
borne last week, b-inging two of
ber nieces, Misses Martha and
Sarah Griffith. They bad a nice
visit at.d like ourcity very much.
On account of harvest they re
turned to their home near Dodge
City, last Monday.
in that there might be a meeting
of the bead officers of three im
portant organizations and all
being from Meade, that they
might congratulate not only each
other but Meade as well, on the
honors conferred on themselves
and Western Kansas.
There was a crowd of Kansas
politicians in Topeka filing nomi
nation papers last week. The
Secretary of State, Botkins office
the last day 'for Iht filing, was
crowded all day during office
hours.
Saturday evening the Repub
licans of Shawnee county held a
ratification meeting over tb
nomination of Hughes and Fair
banks. It was a getting together
of all factions oi the party. Such
old .-time Progressives as Joe
Dolley, W. R. Stubbs and their
kind were much in evidence. It
now seems as though Vic and
Bill White are the only prodigals
that are left to return to their
old homestead. It looks as
though they will yet take their
political meals with the swine
for awhile at least.
At the First English Lutheran
church of Topeka 'on last Sun
day they held special service.
21 years ago a Memorial window
to the G. A. R , W. R. C. and
Sons of Veterans was unveiled.
This last service held Sunday
June 25th. Col. P. H, Caney de
livered a lecture explaining the
different emblems and badge of
all the army corps that took part
in the war of the Rebellion.
The Department Commander
then spoke along patriotic lines.
The exercises were inrersperced
with patriotic music, making a
splendid and instructive service.
