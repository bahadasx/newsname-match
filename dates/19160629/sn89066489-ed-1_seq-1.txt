Mexicans rauso first
Note Found oil the Body of Cap
tain Boyd Proves
Treachery,
Field Headquarters, Mexico,
Jane 25 (by wireless to Columbus,
N. M., June 26). The rescue in
safety of Capt. Lewis S. Morey,
Tenth Cavalry, after heroic per
sonal sacrifices in the effort to
save the lives of the men who es
caped with him after the Battle
of Carrizal, is told in' a report to
General Pershing from Major
Jenkins, commanding . the Elev
enth Cavalry detachment sent ou
to find the survivors. , '
Definite figures on the losses at
Carrizal, and details of the battle
were given by Major Jenkins. Of
the eighty-four men, twenty-three
men were killed or died of
wounds, seventeen were captured
and ' are in prison at Chihuahua,
forty-three have been rescued and
one is still missing, lost in the
desert. " .
Major Jenkins reported that a
note found in Capt. Charles T.
Boyd's pocket proves that the
American commander, who lost
his life in a charge on the Mexi
can machine gun trench, was in
vited into the town of 'Carrizal by
Gen. Felix Gomez, the , Mexican
commander but had refused and
afterwrdsanferjEdwitlL Gomez
outside the town. Neither the
notebook of Capt. Boyd nor that
of Captain Morey, both of which
were recovered, threw any new
light on the clash, according to
the report. After the first firing
Troop K, under' !Captain Morey,
took refuge in a nearby adobe hut,
Major Jenkins reported. Believ
ing they were surrounded and
outnumbered by Mexican troops,
he ordered his men to leave the.
hut in -small detachments, that
their chances of escape might be
increased. - v
Captain Morey, himself, suffer
ing with slight wounds with four
men, remained hidden throughout
the -day in the house, which was
within two thousand yards of the
Carranzista line. That night the
party of four started afoot in an
attempt to make their way back
to the expeditionary command.
Captain Morey soon became so
weak from loss of blood that he
was unable to walk, and believ
ing he' was dying he ordered his
men to leave him and save them
selves. This they did, but shortly the
wounded officer managed to rally
enough strength to crawl to the
ranch house of an American
named McCabe, living about nine
miles from Carrizal.
Major Jenkins reported that he
had found Captain Morey hidden
in McCabC's house and that his
wounds were not dangerous.

24. Maj. V. O. Williams, surgeon
of Missouri National Guard, own--
er of the Vernon Hospital at Ne

Missouri Pacific, died of apoplexy
at the. wheel of his motor car this
afternoon while driving from

years old and recently had mar
ried. He was mustered into the
regular service yesterday and as
a result his widow will receive
$1,500 which is six months pay
for an officer of his rank. Mrs.
Williams would have received
nothing had he delayed action.

guard mobilization is believed to
have hastened his death, the sec

COMPANY B AT KSVADA
local Company Leaves for the
Mobilization Camp Thursday
Night.
f Company B, under command of
Captain E. S. Clark, left Thurs
day evening for Nevada, where
the boys are getting outfitted and
made into soldiers, preparatory
to being sent to the Mexican bor
der, where they will take the place
of the regular soldiers who are
needed in Mexico. It is not the
indention - at the present time to
take any of the National Guard
across the border.
It was the original plan to have
the company go on Wednesday
night, but a full quoto of men had
not been secured at that time, so
the departure was deferred until
Thursday.
About 7:00 o'clock the Butler
Concert Band went to the West
school grounds where the com
pany had been in camp since
Tuesday, and escorted it to the
depot. A special car had been set
on the siding for the boys, on
which they soon loaded their
equipment. Probably the largest
crowd that ever assembled at the
station were there., to bid them
good bye. . . J
Jt was nearly an hour before
the arrival of the train during
which time the band played patri
otic jurs anil the hovs were ner-
m?iteJTomlng1civit'h the crowds
When the time of parting arrived
parti
there was many sobs and tears as
mothers, sweethearts and sisters
bad.e their loved ones, good bye
anil tears were seen running down
the cheeks of many fathers who
were sending their sons out to
fight for their' country. Several
cheers were started, but the occas
ion was too solemn for cheers.
Ail the glamor of war was wiped
out and the thought uppermost
in the minds of all was : ' ' Will
they all come back?"

Sunday several hundred from
this city went to Nevada to visit
the boys in camp. Most ot the
routine work was suspended and
the boys spent the day entertain
ing their guests and showing them
over the camp. They were all in
good health and were taking to
the soldier life like veterans.
Company B is one of the finest
looking companies at Nevada and
should they ever be called into ac
tive service they are sure to acquit
themselves like heroes. The Sec
ond regiment, of which they are
a part is commanded by Col. W.
A. Raupp, of Pierce City, an of
ficer of many years experience in
the. National (5uard and a veter
an of the Spanish-American war.
Major A. V. Adams, formerly
of this city, is the chief quarter
master of the camp, and is one of
the hardest worked men on the
grounds, .as all the equipment for
all the troops -from Missouri must
pass through his hands. Captain
J. E. Thompson, is also attached
to the quartermaster department
and will be in charge of the horses
and mules of the brigade. Ser
geant Charlie Mains, another for
mer Butler boy, is in the commis
sary department. Captain R. D.
Allen is another of the quarter
master department boys who is
putting in about 20 hours per day
of good hard work. Zack Patter
son, of Jefferson City, son of J. A.
J,4itteradxyisJiidgeJLlvo''ate gon-
eral. Ludwick Graves is tin offi
cer in the Second regiment, and
with General Clark in command of
the whole brigade residents and
former residents of this city play
a pretty big part in military af
fairs of the state. '

Interesting Letter from Camp,.
Clark.
Camp Clark, June 27, 1916.
Editor Times, . .
Butler, Mo.-
We arrived- in Camp Clark
Wednesday night about 10 :30 and
pitched camp. We found that we
needed some neAV non-commissioned
officers and the following
were appointed: Sergeants, Lee
Bright, Laverne Ward, and Alfred
Ellis; Corporate, Ormie Weiser,
Vernon Corum, John Mansfield,
Bill Grout, Lewis Barker, Floyd
Keeser and Everett Bland., Les
lie Choate was appointed com
pany Clerk. H. E. Ellis passed a
good examination as second lieu
tenant and has been commis
sioned. We don't know when we will
get out-of here but will be report
ed ready in a day or so. Recruits
are coming in "on every train, 75
from somewhere, I don't, know,
where, just marched by in civilian
clothes.
Great train loads of supplies
are coining in daily and the troops
are being equipped as fast as pos
sible. The First Regiment, from
St. Louis, have been examined and
equipped and are . expecting or
ders to move to Ft. Sam Houston,
Texas, at any time.
. Our two colored cooks. Birdie
White and Snow Bledsoe, have
been rejected by the enlisting of
ficers, as have all the colored
cooks, as white and colored troops
are not allowed in the same organ
ization. Sunday most everybody" was
here to see the boys. Lots of
folks from Butler and all over
the state. It was. estimated tha
there were 20,000 people and 1.500
ears here. There was no disorder
and the boys took special pains
to explain everything to their vis
itors. The machine gun compan
ies and batteries of artillery were
of special interest, and the .men
in charge of the guns spent a good
part of the day explaining the
workings of their pets.
Sunday night the camp was vis
ited by a fierce storm and most
everyone got wet.
Tell" the folks back home not to
expect too many letters from the
boys just yet as we arc working
awful hard getting ready. Lieu
tenant Ellis and Company Clerk
Choate are working hard on the
company papers all day and half
the. night.
Very respectfully,
"Company Clerk."
Loyal Sons Present Company B
With Flag. !t!
If. O. Maxey, Wilbur Weltoil
and T. C. Robinson, a committee
from the Loyal Sons Bible Class of
the Christian Church, went to Ne
vada Monday evening and pre
sented to Company B a beautiful
silk flag.
After "retreat" that evening
the company was formed in line
in front of Captain Clark's tent
and the second regiment band
played "The Star Spnagled Ban
ner," alter which Mr. Maxey in
a short but appropriate speech
presented the flag to the com
pany with the best wishes of the
Loyal Sons. Captain Clark, on be?
half of the company, responded
with a speech in which he voiced
the appreciation of the company
for the beautiful emblem and told
the representatives of the Loyal
Sons that they would never have
cause to be ashamed of Company
B, no matter where they might go.
Such remembrance "irom the
folks back home" make the sol
diers' lot much easier and the
knowledge that the home folks are
taking an interest in what they
do is an inspiration to them to be
true to themselves and their coun
try and do their full duty as sol
diers. J.- A. Patterson, of Nyhart,
spent Tuesday at Camp Clark, at
Nevada, with his son, Zack Pat
terson, who is Judge Advocate of
the National Guard of Missouri.
Major Patterson is very anxious
to go to Mexico with the troops
and he comes by that desire hon
estly, as both of his grandfathers
fought in the Mexican war; Sam
uel Patterson was with General
Taylor and Jack Stanley, his ma
ternal grandfather, was with CoL -Doniphan's
men. -.
