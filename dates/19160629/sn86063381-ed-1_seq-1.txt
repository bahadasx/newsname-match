MINNESOTA GUARDS
ARE GIVEN STRICT
PHYSICAL EXAMS
Grpher Hospital Corps Becomes
Prominent in Activities of
Camp Bobleter.
VERY FEW MILITIA MEN ARE WASHINGTON WAITING FOR
DECLARED UNFIT FOR SERVICE
Troopers Send Requests for Home
Papers Civilians Urged to
Salute Flag.
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Camp Bobleter, Fort Snelling,
Minn., June 29.Although Minne
sota's national guard is seventeen
hundred perfectly good miles from
Mexico's border, the Minnesota hos
pital corps became prominent in camp
activities today.
Physical Exams.
Every recruit and "old guard"
here today was given a strict phys
ical examination. Gophers don't
usually show signs.of physical debili
ties. The climate here seems to for
bid that. So there were not a great
many of the boys sent back home be
cause of the examination.
There were a few, however, de
clared physically unfit. These were
the men who rumor said had mur
mured against the federal oath. Just,
the murmuring was enough. No
matter how fit they really were, they
were barred from service because, of
ficers said, men who don't want to
fight, are not wanted to fight.
Dance in Evening.
Guardsmen are experiencing real
hardship in getting dancing part
ners. They have been forced in their
evening dances to select half of their
number, tie a white band around
their arms to characterize them as
"ladies," and dance with them on the
hard .ground of the company streets.
XJuar^hteif ivhq don't spend their
-eveniirgs-ihnrcing sjrend their time
reading letters from "back home,"
and reading their local newspapers.
Papers Hard to Get.
These newspapers from home are
hard to get. Members of the guard
today appealed to their friends and
relatives "back home," through the
United Press, for the home paper.
They can get all the city papers at
the camp, they say, but it's the home
paper they want. Those guardsmen
having the papers are always sur
rounded by others from their home
town.
Anti-typhus units were adminis
tered to some members of the guard
today. Dr. A. J. Sheejey of the Uni
versity of Minnesota is in charge of
this work. Three treatments will be
given every man at intervals of from
seven to ten days. These treatments
usually make the recricant quite ill
for a few hours.
Shortage of Uniforms.
Some officers today admitted that
it would be impossible for all the
guard to get away before the first of
the week. This is on account of a
shortage of uniforms, blankets and
other articles of bedding. Guard of
ficers won't forward their men until
this equipment comes.
Guard officers today appealed to
the United Press to ask visitors to
the camp to salute Old Glory, waving
over regimental headquarters, at the
entrance to the infantry camp, where
the majority of visitors go. They ask
that civilians bare their heads when
passing the flag. Such action is not
required of civilians, although sol
diers are required to salute it. "The
flag and what it represents is what
we are fighting for," one guardsman
said today.
Engineers Arrive.
Brownsville, Tex., June 29.The
first section of the U. S. engineering
corps from Washington reached Har
lingen, Tex., today. It consisted of
