P.y United Press. ;:
.Mexico City, June 2!1. Carranza's
reply to Wilson's note will allege that
a number of Wilson's statements re
garding alleged Mexican outrages are
based . upon t unauthentieated rumors,
it was learned here last night. The
reply not jet completed, but Carran
t.n indicated in a speech to students
last night (something of its character.
"The American note, purporting to
he an answer toflie Mexican note is
not an answer at all, but a series of
charges," he said. "The reply we are
preparing is designed to rectify these
fctatemeiils."
Hy United Press.
Washington, June 29. The release
of the American prisoners held in Chi
huahua City by Carranza, as reported
by a dispatch from (Jen. Funstou last
'night, is regarded as being a step to
ward avoiding the "gravest eonseQuen
ces," the danger of immediate hostil
ities between the Ihiited States and
Mexico being averted, but much yet
remains to be done before the con
troversy is settled.
Until the full text of Carranza's re
ply to President Wilson's two recent
notes reaches Washington, it will not
be known how fully the Mexican cri
sis has been modified. The president
wishes to know what Carranza's atti
tude in the luturo will be, what his ex
planation of the Carrizal fight is and
whether (lis future intentions embody
co-operation with the American forces
in Mexico. It is believed that the pres.
ident is willing to go even more than
half way to meet the first chief in an
effort to solve, the problem that is con
fronting tho two nations.
The recent crisis served to retard
any hope that Carraliza may have had
for the immediate withdrawal of the
American, troops. It is known that
this will not, be done uhder any cir
cumstances at the present time. So
far as the situation generally is con
cerned administration officials are not
optimistic,. ... ;
President Wilson may bo expected
to speak to. the country oil the Mexican
problem. He leaves for Philadelphia
early this afternoon and his address
there will be the first -he has deliv
ered since "the Carrizal incident.' His
friends, however, expect him to open
the subject before the Press club in
New York. -tomorrow night. They be
lieve that he will make a vigorous de
fense of Iwft policies and outline his
future course, perhaps questioning his
critics and political opponents con
cerning what they would do under sim
ilar circumstances. ,

Turner & Co. and driven by O. IJ. Col
lins, :rashed into the side of the Ford
driven by Mr. Wolverton. The acci
dent happened at the corner of Sev

Miss Zimmerman's injuries are consid
ered serious, there being one rib brok
en and a number of bruises.
Mr. Wolverton was driving west on
Minnesota avenue, going home to
lunch. Only he and Miss Zimmerman
were in the car. As he came to Sev
enth street, another car was coming
from the west, and just as be readied
the middle of Seventh street, the Tur
ner delivery car, coming from the
north, crashed into him, square on the
side.
The Wolverton car was thown com
pletely over and hurled against the
curb with both occupants underneath.
Mr. Wolverton held up most of the
weight of the car while Miss Zimmer
man, his sister-in-law, was being tak
en from beneath.
Mr. Wolverton thinks the car which
struck him was going at an outrag
eous speed. He states that he him
self Was driving slowly.
In the Turner car, besides Mr. Col
lins, driver, was R. B. Human and an
other man, a workman at the Turner
produce house. Mr. Collins denies
that he was speeding. He had no oth
er statement to niaka concerning the
accident.
Mr. Human declares that both cars
were going slow and that Mr. Collins
set his brakes several feet before the
crash, doing all in his power to pre
vent the accident.
Both cars were badly smashed up.
The front wheels, and whole front end
of the Turner delivery car, was smash
ed, and Mr. Wolverton's car was even
more damaged."' '
Miss Zimmerman was resting well
at the Wolverton home, in the west
part of the city, at 3 o'clock.

The new catalogue of the Oklahoma
t'oliege for Women, announcing a
course of study as strong as can be
found in any college in the south, and
a list of thirty-three professors and in
structors, has just been received from
the printers and is being mailed out.
from the college offices this week.
Three thousand copies of the volume
have been printed and will be distrib
uted witlifn the next four weeks.
The catalogue is complete in every
detail, mapping out first of all the gen
eral information about the school, its
history and its aim, then going into
the details of methods and require
ments for matriculation and course of
study.
The book is a complete volume of
information for students intending to
enter, or tor parents who wish to place
their daughters in college. It gives
living expenses in the dormitory as
$1G a month for board and room, with
all other expenses estimated; informa

withdrawals from the college, etc.
The course of study mapped out in

In Charge of Experts.
In the technical arts department,
Miss Zoe Norman, assisted by Miss
Julia 15. Brekke, has charge of domes

sisted ' by Miss Laura Finch, has
charge of domestic art; Mrs. Edna B.

Miss Irene Shaley, assisted by Miss
Geneva May, has the physical educa

charge of the library and teaches li

In- this department will be found
courses tlmt not only cannot be obtain-j

but it is doubtful if they can be ob

anywhere in the southwest. It has of-!

open for young women right now is
that of teaching domestic science and
domestic, art in high schools. A spe

those who wish to fit themselves co
do this work. Courses are so arrang

just what she needs worst if she wish-'

household economics for use in the

wishes to take a lot of work to pre

yet does not want to spend more than
one or two years in taking the work.
All About Foods.
Among courses offered are those
that treat in a general way of the dif

them, others that go into the science
of nutritive value of foods,, other? f-if
treat of the kinds of foods to cook and
methods of preparing '.hem for people

BUSINESS MEN GO ON
RECORD FOR BIG HOTEL
This is the greatest opportunity
that has come to, Chk'kasha lu years,"
William lteinhelnier of the Hub Cloth
ing store said this morning in discuss
ing the hotel offer made to the citi
zens by an outside capitalist. "The
revenue from taxation would be great,
In fact, great enough to make the deal
a, profitable one for the city," he con
tinued, "but that other benefit of fur
nishing tills city with first class hotel
accommodations, and a large building
at the same time is greater than many
of us realize.
"Here is an opportunity to give th'
town a big boost, to put it back at the
'top of progressive growing Oklahoma
cities, the place It occupied only a few
years ago. The loss will not be to a
few individuals, but to the whole town
If we let the opportunity pass.
"Such things us this do not come to
a town of their own accord. Cities do
not grow of themselves. It takes pa
triotic spirit and pulling together In
the harness for those things of gen
eral benefit to put a city at the top.
This hotel will give us a lot of con
struction work for several months and
it will bring in many more people to
the town. It Is an opportunity of
years."
R. F. Thweatt of the Owl drug store !
was fully as enthusiastic over it. "Yes.
it will certainly be a wonderful asset
to the city," he said, "we should take
up the proposition before some othe:'
town offers the capitalist a better
one."
Roy C. Smith, of the Chlekasha Na
tional bank, declared that merely as a
financial investment, he could not see
where the citizens of Chlekasha could
spend $15,000 so profitably. ';Th rev
enue from taxation and the revenue
from business now going elsewhere.
and the advantage from Increase ot
property values in the entire city make
it an tinusunal offer to Chlekasha,"
.X. Abeccrombii', of the Abercrom
bie Grocery company, thinks a good
hotel is one of the greatest necd.i of
the city. "The kind proposed here, a
quarter of a million dollar structure,"
he said, "would be a credit to any city.
I think it would bring returns to the
city commensurate with the Invest
ment of the $t."i.O(iO asked for."
Ed F. Johns, of the Citizens National
bank, Is confident that the people of
Cliickasha will take advantage, of the
opportunity to obtain the big Invest
ment and improvement. "It's a tiling
we have been behind in for years," he
said, "and taken from any point of
view, I consider the offer made b the
outside capitalist one that should be
taken up."
R. K. Wootten of the Cliickasha
Cotton Oil company, is one of the most; r,amlfll are rt;(., ,0 Sed the little
enthusiastic boosters in the city for'f.lIk- ... s,.,, ... ,. R-...H satur-
the hotel proposition. "We need the
hotel, and need it badly," he s.iid.
"The structure proposed is a good one,
I
the kind we are suffering for. There
are very few hotels of this size erect
ed anywhere without the raising of a
bonus, and I see tie reason why we
should not be glad of the opportunity
to take up such an offer.
"The investment of I.T.U.Oud in the
city will add for the years to come a
good annual increase to taxation reve
nues. It would be good business for
the ity. county or state to offc. In
ducements, but since this is impossl-

ble, I see no reason why the citizens
should not be willing to give a bon.i
equal to what is asked, which Is no
more than taxes on the properly pos
sibly for two years."
W. W. liynuiu, of Dynum and l inn-
pauy, grocery, Is confident that the
citizens of Cliickasha will take advan
tage of the hotel offer. "It spells
progress," he said this morning, "It
means a forward step for the city
And it is a good Investment for the
citizens of the town, from whatever
angle they consider it."
Ben Johnson, of the First National
bank, said:
"In expressing my sentiments with
reference to the present proposed ho
tel for ChickaHha, it seems to me that
the benefits are so far reaching to
every one In Cliickasha that to give
would be a privilege rather th.ui a
duty. A contribution from every man,
woman and child, ever so small, would
represent the sentiment of the people
of Cliickasha to the one who offers so
much, and by way of illustration:
"Little drops of water,
"Little grains of sand,
"Make the mighty ocean
"And the pleasant land.
"Every one knows best what they
are able to give, If it be nlckles, dimes.
j quarters or dollars. Do not let any
one else do your part."
