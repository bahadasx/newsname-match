—for many years.

body has known abotit it everybody has talked about it but
nobody has had the courage to break it up. a'-^. »v
It has been a game for high stakes—the wealth of a whole
state has been spread put on the green cloth—a fabulous amount
off money—mote than any of US ever saw together in one pile in
out lives.
STOLEN MONEY has been stacked high around the room
while these hard-visaged and shriveled souled old gangsters have
GAMBLED fdr the wealth OTHER PEOPLE PRODUCED.
'^That master card sharp, Big Biz, has got mdst of the mone|
toe'rest of the gang have, brought in to gamble over his table^
i?*k- Officers of the law have known about this game and the people
have looked to them to break it up,% but they have failed to do it.
More than that, they have on more than one occasion openly refused
to act as they were ordered to act to BREAK UP THIS JAME, I
On one occasion a high officer of the law WENT INTO COURT
TO MAKE TROUBLE FOR JIONEST CITIZENS who were trying
to break up .the, crooked gambling game in their midst. 3^JN£

robbery. Let's break up their game. We can do it if we stand
together," they have sajd.
