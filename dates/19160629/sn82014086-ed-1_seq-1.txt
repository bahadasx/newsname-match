tional Guardsmen to the Border.
Washington, June 25. An Immedi
ate break between the United States
and the de facto government of Mexi-
co naa been averted by compliance
with the American demand for release
of the twenty-three troopers captured
in the fight at Carrizal
No Decision Pending Note from Car
.' ranza.
Vv nether a state of war has been
prevented or merely postponed no one
here would attempt to say tonight.
Official Information as to the attitude
of General Carranza was lacking. Un
til his response to Secretary Lansing's
note, dispatched Sunday, making two
peremptory and distinct demands, is
received there will be no decision on
whether President Wilson shall lay
the crisis before congress.
Newa of Release of Prisoners."
News of the release of the prison
ers, received early tonight in press
despatches, brought undisguised re
lief to high officials. It was accepted
as correct, although no announcement
had come through official sources.
Moreover, it was assumed that Car
ranza, Impressed with the urgency of
the situation, had ordered . the cap
tured cavalrymen started for the bor
der without waiting for his announce
ment of the action to reach Washing
ton. While It Is generally conceded that
this move lessens tension and makes
the crisis less Imminent, no one con
versant with the grave problem is los
ing sight of the fact that the all-important
question of Carranza's atti
tude toward the American expedition
across the border to protect the terri-
tftry and citizens of the United States
from bandit outrages remains unset
tled. If the de facto government
stands upon the orders to General
Trevino to attack Pershing's men
when they move otherwise than to
ward the border, the situation actually
is just what It was before, except that
there now is a possibility of diplo
! matio negotiations that did not exist
while the Americans were held pris
I oner at Chihuahua,
j War Preparations to Go On.
I The preparations of the -United
j States for war will go steadily for
ward. There will be no Interruption
of the rush of national guradsmen to
the border and General Funston will
continue disposing of the forces un
der his command as if he expected an
immediate attack from the Mexicans.
The fact that Carranza has com
plied with one of the demands is ac
cepted by the more optimistic offi
cials here as an indication that he
Is striving to prevent a break. Even
If he again should attempt to throw
all blame for the Carrizal fight upon
the American officers and insist upon
nis rignt to oppose lormlDly any ex-
jcept northward movements of Ameri
can troops, it is thought that possibly
ne wm state nis position in such a
way as to make further discussion
necessary.
Will Insist Upon Free Movement of
Troops.
During any negotiations, however,
tne vmitea states win insist upon
freedom, of movement of the troops in
Mexico and any attempt to interfere
with them will be met by such force
as Is necessary. This will apply, too,
to any period of delay occasioned by
attempts to arrange mediation or ar
l Duration.
i Mediation Widely Discussed.
I The nosslbilitv of Latin-American
I offers of mediation in the crisis again
was widely discussed tonight. Igna
Iclo Calderon, minister from Bolivia,
will make a second call upon Secre
! tary Lansing tomorrow to discuss the
iBUDject. He will endeavor to ascer
1 tain for the benefit of himself and his
colleagues whether a tender of good
i offices by the South and Central
'American republics would be enter
.talned at this time. The minister said
after his first conference with Secre
tary Lansing on Monday that he un
derstood the United States to be un
; willing even tp discuss the subject of
i mediation or arbitration while the
captured American troopers remained
in custoay.
It is known that powerful influences
have been brought to bear on Car
ranza in the past few days to make
him at least turn over the American
prisoners. Prominent Mexicans in the
United' States as well as American
bankers and business interests with
influence In Mexican affairs have
flooded the first chief with messages.
They all sent the same warning that
the United States government meant,
business and that to hold the pris
oners would mean war.
j Secretary Baker waited at the war
! department until late tonight for a
report from General Funston on Gen
eral Trevino's announcement that he
had sent the cavalrymen to Juarez to
be set free. He finally went home
without the report. '-
CARRANZA COMPLIES WITH
PRESIDENT WILSON'S DEMAND
eral Carranza for the release of the
American prisoners held In the Chi
huahua penitentiary today met with
compliance. -
Late this afternoon It was - an
nounced from the commandancia in
Juarez that a message had been trans
mitted over the Mexican - telegraph
which stated that the twenty-three
negroes of the Tenth Cavalry captured
at Carrlzal with Lem ri. Splllsbury,

The message added that the men,

The telegram conveying this news
was addressed to General George Bell,
Jr., commander of the El Paso base.
It was signed by General Jacinto- Tre
vino, commander of the Mexican mili
tary district of the northeast, whose
headquarters are at Chihuahua City.
General Bell, In . keeping with his
custom of maintaining close secrecy
regarding all . military developments,
refused to say whether he had re

PENAL SERVITUDE FOR
GERMAN SOCIALIST LEADER
Dr. Karl Liebknicht Dismissed From
Army For Insubordination.
Berlin. June 28. via Amsterdam to
London, 9.31 p. m. Dr. Karl Lieb
knicht, the socialist leader, was .sen
tenced today to thirty months' penal
servitude and dismissal from the army
for attempted high treason, gross in
subordination and resistance to the
authorities.
The court adopted the view that
Dr. Liebknecht was guided by poli
tical fanaticism and not by unpatriotic
reeling, and therefore Imposed the
lowest -i penalty on him. Dr. Lleh
knecht is entitled to appeal from the
sentence. The chare-e aeainst Dr
Liebknecht was attempted treason
during war time and resistance of the
authorities.
The trial was held behind olnaed
doors. When the court martial con
vened there was a large attendance
of persons interested in the case but
tne room was almost immediately
cleared while the court considered a
motion- made by the prosecutor to ex
clude the public during the entire
trial, "in the interest of public se
curity." This motion was granted and
it was ordered also that newspapers
should print no reports of the ' trial
except the verdict which would be
made public.

PROTESTS BY MEXICAN -
AMBASSADOR-DESIGNATE
Against Alleged Actions of Pershing's
Men Toward Mexicans.
Washington June- 28. Secretary
Lansing had not studied today the
trio of communications submitted to
the state department within the last
24 hours by Eliseo Areedondo, Mex
isan ambassador-designate'. They
protest against the alleged actions of
large column of General .Pershing a
men toward Mexican citizens, against
the arrest of other Mexicans in the
United States and against the general
embargo, effected without proclama
tion, stopping virtually .all shipments
to Mexico.
The protests are being treated as
routine matters in the state depart
ment. Two of them, relating to al
leged improper treatment of Mexican
citizens, require reports either from
army officers or from federal civil au
thorities in California and Arizona, be
lore any answer can be made.
ne protest dealing with the em
bargo situation probably could be
quickly disposed of. In its ' note last
Sunday, the Washington government
informed General Carranza that it
construed as deliberately hostile his
orders to General Trevino to limit, by
rorce, tne operations or General Per
shing's men. A formal repudiation of
this attitude has been required of the
de facto government. If any reply
were made to Mr. Arredondo pending
tne receipt oi some reply to that de
Diana, undoubtedly it would be pointed
out that the United States government
Is not disposed to furnish supplies to
a potential enemy.

Mr. Hughes issued the following
statement:
"I -was very much pleased with Col
onel Roosevelt's letter of indorsement
and he has expressed himself in a
very kindly way with respect to mv
telegram to the progressive committee.
i wanted to talk with Colonel Roose
velt fully with respect to the issues
of the campaign and asked him to
dine with me so that we might have
that opportunity. He dined with me
tonight and we had a very delightful
interview. We talked very fully over
all matters and are In complete ac
cord. The evening has been a very
pleasant one.
Colonel May Take Stump.
.It is understood that Colonel Roose
velt told Mr. Hughes he would coop
erate heartily with him in any of his
plans, even to the extent of making a
speaking tour if Mr. Hughes so de
sired.
Tonether Two and a Half Hours.
Colonel Roosevelt called upon Mr.
Hughes at the nominee's invitation
and they remained together for more
than two and a half hours. A crowd
had gathered in the lobby of the hotel
where' Mr. Hughes is staying when
Colonel Roosevelt arrived. The for
mer president lifted his hat and bow
ed, then hurried into an elevator
which took him to Mr. Hughes' apart
ment. The parlor had been fitted up
as a dining room and a large txm
quet of roses on the table confronted
the two as they entered.
They Dined Alone.
The republican nominee and Colonel
Roosevelt dined alone. The waiter
who served them was barred from the
room except when . specially summon
ed Dy a call button. . -.-
Roosevelt Wishes Hughes Luck.
After the interview Mr. Hughes
emerged with Colonel Roosevelt, es
corting the former president to his
automobile and warmly shaking his
hand as he bade him goodbye. When

Roosevelt looked around and. waving
his hand to Air. Hughes, said:
Goodbye, and the best possible
luck."
Colonel Greatly Pleased.

before his departure for his home at
Oyster Bay, said that he and Mr.
Hughes had had a most satisfactory

pleased. The former president made
it .plain that he agrees with the at
titude Mr. Hughes has taken toward
the questions at issue in the campaign
and he assured the nominee that he
would support him with the utmost
heartiness.

Hughes said he much desired the
colonel to aid in the campaign and it
was agreed that in the fall Colonel
Roosevelt should make three or four
speeches for Mr. Hughes.

said tonight that he was willing to
work' side by side with Colonel Roose
velt to aid in the election of Mr.
Hughes. Asked if he would be will
ing to speak from the same platform
as uolonei Roosevelt he said:
."I am for Hughes. I would not let
my personal feeling interfere. If such
speaking arrangements were made I
would act as a private in the ranks
and obey orders.

DEARTH OF BORDER NEWS
AT WAR DEPARTMENT
Almost Swamped by Detail Work for
Transporting , Guardsmen.'
Washington, June 28. There was a
dearth of border advices at the war de
jartment today. Nothing was received
relating to any incident which might
be the basis for charges contained in
Mr. Arredondo's note that American
troops has mistreated a large number
of American citizens. The note will
be submitted to General Funston so
that a report from General Pershing
may De ODtainea.
The department was almost swamp
ed, however, by the accumulating de
tailed work or getting 100,000 guards
men to the border in the shortest pos
sible time. Reports to the quaterr-
master general showed that the rail
roads were meeting the unusual strain
upon their facilities in highly satis
factory manner. Troop, supply and
trains are rusning soutnwara over
every available line. New trains are
starting every hour. A fiood of rail
road equipment is converging' on the
border distribution points.- Traffic ex
perts of all lines involved are tolling
night and day with army officials to
see that no serious delay occurs.

1914, was made the innocent tool of
Captain Franz von Papen, recalled
German military attache in the lat-

lined by Tauschers counsel, Herbert
C Smyth, today. It is expected Tausch
er will go on the witness stand in his
own behalf when the trial is resumed
tomorrow.
Horst von der Goltz the men upon
whose confession Tauscher, Wolf von

Germany, volunteered his services to
his country, although past the age
limit. He was told to come to New
York and report to Von Papen.
1 will be glad to do all I can for
my country," Mr. Smyth quoted
Tauscher as saying to Von Papen, but
i ask you to me your word as a gen

not ask me to do anything against the

be unfriendly to he people of this
country, among whom I am making

Attorney Collapsed in the Midst of an
Impassioned Plea.
London, June 28. 5.25 p. m. A day
filled with sensational incidents at the
trial of Sir Roger Casement for trea
son was brought to a sudden and dra
matic close late this afternoon when
Sergeant Sullivan, Sir Roger s leading
attorney, collapsed in the midst of an
impassioned summing up.
Mr. Sullivan, who himself is an Irish
man, was painting a picture of the
wrongs he declared were suffered by
Ireland and maintaining that the pris
oner had committed no treason when
he attempted to raise an Irish brigade
in Germany for the purpose of pro
tecting the rights of the people of
Ireland against "unlawful tyranny.
It was during one of his most heat
ed outbursts that the speaker sud
denly paused, swayed heavily against
the bench and then collapsed into a.
seat.
Just previously, the chief justice had
cautioned the attorney that he must
keep to the evidence in his argument,
the justice adding that he had with
