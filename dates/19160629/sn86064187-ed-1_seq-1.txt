Nearly three hundred of thr lead

Absolutely no legitimate objections
have been advanced
lb Times has during the past
three weeks, presented many strong
arguments whv memberships in the
organization were desirable, and the
Isit y of citizenship It could produce

ambitious goal, to lead all cities i f
