in getting 2 runs The Boosters
scored one in the 8th. and one in
the 9th. making the score at the
end of the 9lh inning 22
There was no score in loth but
owing to a bad arm the Monroe

Looks Like war
Mr. Boulware saw 10.000? troops
at Springfield III. Sunday. 5.000 of
these were drilling and it was a
sight. The boys were, for the most
part, not used to being out in the
open and the way some were blis
tered and burned by the sun was a
fright. Three trains entered the
city while he was there, one loaded
with machine guns and cannon,
one with ammunition and one with
miscellaneous supplies. It looks
very much like war to him.
