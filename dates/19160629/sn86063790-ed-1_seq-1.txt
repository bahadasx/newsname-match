GREENWOOD WINS FIRST.
Establishes Record for State at Firemen's
Tournament. !
Orangeburg, June 21.?Greenwood
won first prize, $250, in the grand
hose wagon race at the State firemen's
tournament here this afternoon,
the time being 28 1-5 seconds,
the record for the State. Second
prize, $150, went to Newberry; time,
29 1-5 seconds. Sumter and Columbia
t^ed for third prize, $100, the
time of each being 30 seconds.
Other entries in this race were
Bennettsville, Marion, Kingstree, Abbeville,
Bishopville, Laurens, George
town and Orangeburg. Kingstree was
thrown out on account of assistance
at the hydrant. % Georgetown was
ruled out because the bell failed to
eound on the first attempt, and the
horse would not go on Georgetown's
supplemental run, which was to be
made after the others.
Fastest time to the hydrant in the
grand race was made by (^rangeburg
in 13 seconds; Georgetown second,
13 1-5, and Bennettsville third,
13 2-5 seconds.
NEW VENOMOUS SNAKE.
The Reptile is a Puzzle to California
Naturalists.
" *
A poisonous snake that reptile experts
and naturalists have so far
been unable to classify, and which
may be of a new species, came into
the possession of Ed Hamby and
Jack Horn. The snake was caught
by a Mexican at one of the road
camps near Los Angeles.
The snake has two fangs, each
about one-eighth of an inch long. In
an effort to determine whether or
not the reptile is poisonous it was
placed in an inclosure with a white
rat.* The rat was bitten and died in
convulsions shortly afterward.
The snake is 3 1-2 feet in length
and olive green in color. Its color
changes to a pale yellow when it is
angered and light brown markings
appear upon its back. Contrary to
other venomous snakes, it has the
double set of scales that are found
on harmless varieties. The scales
are smooth and it has extraordinarily
long jawbones. Its eyes are the
round-pupiled eyes of the harmless
snake, and it has only one set of nostrils.
Its head is of the same shape
as its harmless brothers. Its tail
tapers to a> fine point and the snake
itself differs in shape from other
poisonous reptiles, in that it is slender
rather than thick-bodied.
It strikes without coiling and
*?- ^
moves wun great swiuucss. wmic
being examined it ejected a stream
of colorless poison for a distance of
17 inches.
Dr. Charles L. Edwards, naturalist
for the public schools, inclines to
the belief that it may be related to
the vipers. "Until this time I have
never known of a smooth-scaled
snake which was poisonous," be
said.?Los Angeles Times.
SUMMER EXERCISE.
Common Sense for the Health
Seeker.
The woman who all the winter has
used only a closed automobile or
warm trolley car, says the Southern
Woman's Magazine, now that summer
has arrived joyously starts forth
to do all sorts of exercise to remove
the flabbiness from her body and improve
her digestion. But exercise in
summer is a doubtful proposition if
started too strenuously.
A horseback ride, a game of tennis,
or golf, digging in one's flower
beds?these are all joys* of the summer
time out-of-doors and are all
excellent exercises, but, oh, the stiffness
of joints and the aching back!
The stiff joints and sore backs would
not pe there if the exercise had been
begun by degrees and if one's muscles
had been kept firm by regular set
exercises that can be done in one's
own room morning and nights.
"Few people realize," says a famous
physical culture authority, "the
harm of strenuous exercise when
" ? i
none at an nas oeeu Laiveu iux
months. A six-mile walk may work
permanent injury to the woman who
has been riding everywhere she went,
and bending over digging for two or
three hours may displace organs that
only an operation will put back
again."
Wannamaker, of Orangeburg, has
gone to North on a visit to relatives.
Mrs. Gatsy Gray, who has been
away to Blackville for a month or
more, returned home Thursday afternoon.
Miss Kathleen Kirkland has gone

STAND BY WILSON.
Byrnes for Action.?Thinks Time Has
Come to Clean Up Mexico.
Washington, June 24.?"You may
say for me individually," Congressman
Byrnes stated, "that I believe
we should go in and clean out Mexico."
N
Continuing, Mr. Byrnes said: "I
am of the opinion that the president
has been most patient and forbearing
in this whole matter, but patience
sometimes ceases to be a virtue, and
we shall back him up in anything he
does with regard to cleaning up.the
Carr&nzistas, the Villistas or any
other socalled Mexican generals. The
South Carolina congressmen will support
the president most unitedly in
his efforts not only to restore order
and bring about peace but also to
protect American interests beyond
the border."
Other members of the delegation
supported Mr. Byrnes in this statement
which leaves no room to doubt
where the South Carolinians stand

INCREASE WARSHIP SIZE. |
Rapid Progress in Battleship Construction
Reported. (
Washington, June 24.?Senator B.
R. Tillman, chairman of the senate
naval affairs committee, made public '
today figures recently submitted by
commander William A. Moffett, showing
the increase in the size of battleship
construction since the Oregon
was built in 1896 up to the present i
time, ships now under consideration
having a length over all of 995 feet, j
with a displacement of 60,000 tons,
carrying, with other armament, 15
16-inch guns, compared with a length
of 558 feet, a displacement of 10,288 ,
tons and four. 13-inch guns in 1896. ,
The history of modern battleship
construction, Commander Moffett
says, shows that their displacement
has steadily increased. Following
the Oregon came the Kentucky class,
11,500; the Maine class, 12,500; the
Georgia class, 14,900; the Connecticut
class, 16,000; increasing at an
average of about 1,000 a year.
The first radical increase came
with the dreadnought, from 16,000
to 20,000 tons. Up to this time the
constructors of th? world imagined
that the standard type of battleship
had been reached in a ship of about
16,000 tons, 18 knots speed, main
battery of four 12-inch guns, in two
centre line turrets, intermediate battery
of 6-inch guns, and 3-inch guns
for torpedo defense, represented by
the American Connecticut. British
navy brought forward the dreadnought,
making an increase of 4,000
tons disDlacement and two knots in
" * A
speed. In the United States the
South Carolira class came next, all
big gun ships with turrets on centre
line.
The dreadnought immediately
scrapped all other battleships, in the
British as well as in other navies.
This is where Great Britain's rivals,
especially Germany, had their opportunity.
They should have promptly
scrapped all their old ships and spent
all their available money for battleships
that would outpoint the dreadnought.
"England's reasons for not wishing
td increase the displacement of her
battleships beyond what it is are obvious
enough. She had a bad scare
after the dreadnought's design became
public and she found Germany
laying down many ships of equal and
larger displacement, and she lost lio
time in outbuilding Germany in numbers
in these then large ships. She
does not. want this experience duplicated.
She has the largest navy in
the world, and realizes that it is practically
impossible for any other nation
to catch up with her as long as
they confine themselves to ships of
the same size as her own..
It is shown that following the Oregon
the prize ship of Capt. Clark in
1898 and the South Carolina in 1909,
the Delaware class came next in 1910
with a length of 510 feet, ten 12-inch
guns and a displacement of 20,000
tons. After that the Pennsylvania
class came with a length of 600 feet,
with 12 14-inch guns and a displacement
of 31,400 tons. In 1917, according
to suggestions, the limit of
length will be 995 feet, 15 16-inch
guns and a displacement of 60,000
tons.
DARING LEAP SAVES GIRL.
k
Man in Racing Car Jumps Into Buggy
and Stops Runaway.
Spectators were thrilled the other
afternoon when Roy Cattley, 19
years old, son of a wealthy coal operator
of Carnegie, gave a twentieth
century demonstration of daring by
leaping from the running board of a
speeding racing car into a runaway
huggy, probably saving the life of the
girl huddled unconscious in the swaying
vehicle.
Thomas Kane, 20 years old, of
Walker's Mills, and Miss Ethel Morgan,
18 years old, of Carnegie, had
rm* driving when the horse
a WAi l/VU W*|/ V4A * T _
took fright and ran away. Kane was
flung from the buggy when it struck
a street car, suffering fractures, of
five ribs. Cattley, who saw the accident,
jumped into the automobile of
a friend and started off.
After a chase of 2 miles the machine
was drawn up alongside the
buggy. Cattley, at the risk of his
neck, watched his chance, made a
flying leap and landed in the buggy.
He soon had the horse stopped, and
Miss Morgan was revived in a physician's
office. Kane was removed to
a hospital.?Pittsburg Post.
During the last year 79,281,735
short tons of sand and gravel, having
a value of $23,846,999, were dug out

UNCLE SAM'S FINAL WORD
carranza jr'st release all
prisoners.
Situation Exceedingly Acute, Says
Senator Stone After Conference
With President Wilson.
Washington, June 25.?A demand
for the immediate release of the
American troopers taken prisoner at
Carrizal, coupled with a stern notification
that the United States expects
an early statement of the purposes
of the Carranza government, was
telegraphed to Mexico City today by
Secretary Lansing.
The note discloses that the State
department received yesterday a communication
from the de facto government
stating that the Carrizal fight
wls the direct result of orders to attack
American soldiers moving otherwise
than toward the border, personally
issued by Gen. Carranza to Gen.
Trevino, and by the latter communicated
to Gen. Pershing.
In reply Secretary Lansing requires
that the de facto government transmit
a definite statement "as to the
course of action it has determined
upon" through the usual diplomatic
channels, "and not through subordinate
military officers."
Deliberately Hostile.
The Mexican communication is
construed, Secretary Lansing states,
"as a formal avowal of deliberately
hostile action against the forces of
the United States now in Mexico, and
of the purpose to attack without
provocation whenever they move
from their present position," despite
the friendly mission on which they
are engaged, ana wmcii is reaumucu
in the American rejoinder.
Gen. Carranza is required to place
himself on record formally, and the
plain intimation lies behind the restrained
language of Mr. Lansing's
communication that force will be met
with force. Apparently, %owever,
the Washington government is determined
that the de facto government
shall not evade responsibility
before the world if war is forced upon
the United States.
White House Conferences.
The note and the military situation
of the United States were talked
over at the white house tonight by
the president with Chairman Stone,
of the senate foreign relations committee;
Senator Lodge, ranking Republican
member, and Chairman
Flood, of the house committee on
foreign affairs.
After the conference, which lasted
more than an hour, Senator Stone
said the situation was "exceedingly
acute." The president had felt it
npcessarv to acaualnt congress with
the state of affairs and the action |
taken, through the foreign affairs
committee. It was indicated that he
might desire to address a joint session
of the house and senate in a
day or two, but would not take this
final step until the Mexican government
had been given an apportunity
to reply/

New York, June 24.?Gonzalo S.
Cardova, minister from Ecuador to
the United States, announced through
his secretary tonight that he would
leave for Washington late tonight or
early tomorrow to confer with other.
South American diplomats in an effort
to bring about mediation between
the United States and Mexico.
Roumulo S. Naon, Argentine ambassador
to the United States, left

by his secretary.
Dr. Cardova said he had received
instructions from Senor R. H.
Elizalde, the foreign minister of

Ecuador, directing mm to corner wun
the other diplomats and stating he
had sent messages to the foreign minister
of all Latin-American countries
urging him to direct their representatives
at Washington to use their
good offices in an effort to avert a
conflict.
"I feel that war can be averted if
immediate and energetic steps are
taken," said Dr. Cardova through his
son, who acts as his secretary.
He added that while he could, of
course, communicate with his fellow
diplomats by telegraph he felt that
much more could be accomplished by
seeing them personally. He expects
to confer with the other Latin-American
envoys as soon as he reaches

LIGHTS ON BABY CARRIAGES.
New Law in London is Outgrowth of
Zeppelin Raids.
/ ,
London has passed an unusual law,
which requires that baby carriages
shall be equipped with sidelights.
While no adequate explanation is
given, it is believed that the new ruling
was put into effect because of the
darkness into which the streets are
plunged because of the fear of Zeppelin
raids. Baby carriages, while
not dangerous objects, are objects of
danger, and the fact that they are
compelled by law to be equipped with
a lamp to light their way lessens the
possibilities of collisions. The law
requires that the light shall show
white in the front and red in the
rear.?Popular Science Monthly.

Intended to Attack Pershing.
Field Headquarters, June 24.?
Gen. Pershing, American expeditionary

engagement, but were deterred by the
strength of the Americans.
Captain Morey Reported Safe.

Capt. Lewis Sydney Morey is safe,

Second Regiment at Camp Moore*
Oamp Moore, Styx, S. C., June 24.
?The 2nd regiment, National Guard
of South Carolina, Col. Holmes B.
Springs commanding, arrived here .
this morning on schedule time, and
by night the men were fairly comfortably
quartered in their part of- ,
the camp, which had been put in
pretty good shape by the New Brookland

belong to the 2nd regiment, and
which have been in camp for several
days.

After the remarkable farewell dem- .
onstration in Charleston the men
were further encouraged by similar
demonstrations along the route. At
every station were' gathered ^many
people, who applauded the soldiers
and bade them Godspeed. Notable,
among these manifestations of patriotic
interest were those at Lanes,
where Col. Springs boarded the special
Atlantic Coast Line train; at
Manning and at Sumter.

conference at Camp Moore with Col.
E. M. Blythe, of the First regiment,
ranking officer and Col. H. B. Springs,
of the Second regiment.
The following call was signed by
Gov. Manning:
"A crisis confronts us. The call
for service has come.* South Carolina
is expected to do her part. Our
men are responding nobly. About
2,500 are now in camp. We need at
least 1,000 additional men. I make
this appeal to the patriotismJ ana
loyalty of the men of South Carolina
to offer their services without delay.
The matter is urgent. Recruits are
needed at once. I request those in
each community who are interested
in seeing South Carolina furnish her
fun war nnnta nf trnoDs to take the
lead in securing available recruits
for the two South Carolina regiments
and urge that they communicate
with Col. O. K. LaRoque at the governor's
office in Columbia at once.
Recruiting officers will be sent to any
communities that indicate a response
to this appeal. I am confident that
the patriotism of our people will
bring a prompt response.
