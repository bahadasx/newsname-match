The first meeting of the coun
ty candidates was held at Molino
Monday night. Sixteen of the
candidates for the county offices
were present and spoke, more or
less. Some of the delivered real
orations and some of the asked
in a modest way for the support
of their friends.
The meeting was held on the
lawn of Dr. J. F.'Flynt and the
candidates spoke from the rear
of his drug store. A large
crowd of people from Molino and
nearby came on horseback, in
buggies and in cars to hear the
candidates present their claims
and make their promises.
Mr. C. C. Bybee, of Molino,
was elected chairman of the
meeting.
L. A. Pryor, candidate for con
stable of Salt River township,
was the first of the speakers.
Mr. Pryor said that it was his
opinion that a man should not
be elected to an office because of
his fortune or misfortune, and
that the people should be the
judge of his fitness rather than
the man himself. Let the people
be the judges. Ours is not a
government of chanty, but one
of laws and the man best qual
ified for the office should win.
J. At. Brown followed on the
speaksrs platform. Mr. Brown
is the present Constable of Salt
River township and is now run
nig for re-election.' He asked
the voters to treat him as they
did before and said if they saw
fit to do. this, he would be more
than satisfied.
Frank James, also candidate
for Constable, was the third of
the speakers. Mr. James had
no long speech to make. He
promised the people that if elect
ed he would treat all people alike
and discharge the duties of his
office to the best of his knowl
edge and power.
- Churchill B. Kennan, candi
date for Sheriff of Audrain coun
iy, was the next to present his
claims to the voters. Mr. Ken
that he was a Democrat and a
Woodrow Wilson JJemocrat. He
asked the voters to give him the
honor of running for office at
the same time with Wilson.
U. S. (Boss) Goran, present
Constable of Cuivre township,
and candidate for Sheriff of Au
drain county, was the next to
speak. Mr. Goran stated that he
was laboring under a handicap,
for he had just risen from the
bed, where he had been con
fined for twenty-one days. He
based his special appeal to the
voters upon the fact that he
was a self-made man, having
made his own way since he was
fourteen. He invited the voters
to look over his record as con
stable of Cuivre township and
base their action in the primar
ies upon that record.
E. L. Gorman, candidate lor
Sheriff of Audrain County, spoke
next. Mr. Gorman frankly stat
ed that he would like to poll all
of the votes, but realized that
was impossible. He said he
would deeply appreciante all the
votes that he did get.
J. G. Ford, also, candidate for
Sheriff, promised, if elected, to
discharge the duties of the office
to the best of his ability and he
asked any voter who did not feel
that he was the best quaunea
man for the place to refrain
from castinsr his vote for him,
H. H. Grafford, candidate tor
the office of County Treasurer,
was the next speaker, Mr,
Grafford thanked the voters in
advance for any votes they
might see fit to give him at the
cominsr primaries.
J.-C. Ringo, candidate for
County Treasurer, was the next
to sneak. Four years ago Mr.
Ringo ran for Treasurer and two
for Collector. "As
Rob White says," remarked Mr,
Kingo, "they all come back,
and I am coming back once more
to ask the suport of the voters
of Audrain county for the office
of County Treasurer."
S. T. Torreyson, candidate for
the office of County Assessor,
was the next speaker, and he as
sured the voters that no one
would be more appreciative of
each and every vote cast in his
favor, than he.
J. P. Powell, candidate for
Assessor, spoke next. He asked
for the support of his Molino
friends and stated that he want
ed only the votes of the men
who thought him to be the best
qualified for the office.
C. C. Bledsoe, canaiaate ioi-e-election
as Judge of the
Western District, was next to
speak Mr. Bledsoe urged that
the voters look up the account
ants' report of the court ac
counts in the Audrain County,
of
Court House and his record as
Judge and upon that to base
their judgement as to the best
qualified candidate for the office
to which he aspired.
S. J. Bowne, also candidate
for Judge of the Western Dis- j
trict, followed Mr. Bledsoe upon :
the speakers' platform. He bas-1
ed his plea for support upon his !
record as clerk of the I-awson
school district and urged equal
appropriation of county funds to
all parts of thexunty alike. He
said that the purpose of a true
Democracy was to let the peo
ple rule.
E. A. Shannon, candidate for
re-election as Representative of
Audrain County, was the next
candidate to present his claims
to the voters. Mr. Shannon has
twice represented Audrain Coun
ty at Jefferson City, and is now
running for the third time. "No
one has ever represented .Au
drain for the third time," said
Mr. Shannon, "for the principal
reason that no one has asked for
that honor." More interest
should be taken in this office, Mr.
Shannon urged. The people
should send a young man to
represent them and allow him to
continue in office so long as he
served them faithfully, for the
reason that the new man in the
House of Representatives is han
dicapped by the very newness of
his surroundings. Those who
have been there for five or six
terms have been able to obtain
larger appropriations for their
counties than the men who have
only served one or even two
terms. Mr. Shanon. promised,
if reelected, to serve the people
of Audrain County to the best
of his ability.
D. M. Slonaker, also candidate
for Representative, was the next
to speak. Mr. Slonaker based
his appeal to the voters on his
interest in the question of good
roads and especially in rural
schools. He said our rural
schools were on the decline, be
cause the larger portion of the
school, fund went to the high
schools of the cities, rather than
to the rural schools. His rem
edy, as suggested, was a school
law which would so change and
improve the rural schools that
the boy and girl living in the
country might be able to go to
school in his or her own district
until twenty years of age, thus
allowing the children a complete
education and keeping them on
the farm at the same time.
R. D. Rodgers, candidate for
Prosecuting Attorney, was the
last to speak. '.'There is . just
enough human selfishness in all
of us," said Mr. Rodgers, "that I
am glad to be the only candidate
for this office. It would make
the campaign more interesting
to you if I had opposition, but I
am frank to say the present con
dition is very satisfactory to
me."
Mr. Rodgers based his appeal
on his previous record as Pros
ecuting Attorney and as State
Senator . "I am glad to be a
Missourian and a Democrat," he
said in conclusion."

One of the funniest and most
interesting entertainments ever
seen here was given at the Lyric
Theatre Tuesday evening. '. "The
Deerstrick Skule of Possom Hol
low," given by Mrs. Charles
Rodgers' Sunday School class of
the Methodist Church brought
back pleasant memories to the
older people, and to the younger
generation, it gave many ideas
of the school conditions and the
school methods inx ante bellum
days.
To the younger1 people who
know only school conditions un
der the most modern circum
stances, the parts seemed to be
over-drawn, but those who' have
"been there" say that such
schools really were conducted
years ago. i
Paul St. Vrain played the part
of the Skulemarster, Professor
Whackford Switch 'em and al
though not an old man by any
means, he knew old time circum
stances and was a stern, digni
fied teacher. The first part of
the play was a regular session of
school and classes were heard
and patriotic songs sung often.
The second part was the last
day of school and the final school
program was given. The com
mitteemen and Beveral patrons
of the school visited it on this
important occasion. L. B.
Hawthorne, J. W. Dry and Wil
lard Potts composed the school
committee. ,
The program contained ora
tions, recitations readings,
songs, music, etc. The feature
of the program was a violin solo
by the Rev. Culbert3on. He
played such fast and lively music
that every foot in the house
was moving. Miss Maude Wal
lace and Mrs. W." W. Fry gave
a French harp duet.
Near the close they are visit
ed by a stragling band of opera
singers and are given a taste of
real theatrical singing. They
made a hit with the audience,
who forced them to answer their
encore. The singers were Mad
ame Human Shank, the famous
Contrary alto, Mrs. Bert Wells;
Madsle - Hazmah Gadaski, the
Uric thriller, Miss Pinkie West;
Senor Portico Curioso, Notori
ous tenner, Clarence ; Hopkins ;
Senor Scantonio Notti, Basso
Profunfo, Ray Millers-5 ' "
Many recitations were given
by the bashful girls and each
was given showers of bouquets
by their school friends.
The remaining cast was com
posed of : Mrs. Russell Emmons
Mrs. R. E. Race, Mrs. S. H.
Richards, Mrs. Charles Carpen
ter, M.- E. Moss, Mrs. Norton
Melson, Mrs. W. R. Hisey,
Mrs.Chas. Campbell, Miss Jennw
Karnes, Mrs. M. E. Moss, Dr. J.
J. Griffin, Mrs. George Kemp,
Mrs. J. J. Wood, Bert Sims.
The entertainment was such
a success Tuesday evening that
it will be repeated Thursday
evening at the Lyric.
Chicago and Alton employes
at Mexico are discussng the
establishment of accommoda
tion passenger service between
Fulton and St Louis, accord
ing to the information brought
to Fulton Tuesday morning.
The gossip is that a passenger
train will start from Fulton at
6:00 a. m. and reach St. Louis
before noon, and then leave St.
Louis in time to get to Fulton
about 10 :00 o'clock at night.
Such a train service .would
enable Fulton people who have
occasion to make short business
trips to St. Louis to go and re
turn the same day. Columbia
has a similar service on the Wa
bash and finds it extremely sat
isfactory. ;
According to the men who
brought the story to Fulton,
there is a general demand along
the Burlington cut-off for . an
accommodation train. Railroad
employes believe it will be put
on in the near future, but are
not sure whether it will start
from Mexico or from Fulton.
The talk among company em
ployes predicts if the accommo
dation train starts from Mexico
a, stub will be, run oh the branch
to Fulton to connect with it.

Prof. French Strother, aged
91 years, died at the Mexico
Hospital Sunday afternoon, af
ter a month's illness. He had
been visiting his daughter, Mrs.
H. P. Warden at Columbia and
Saturday was brought to
the Mexico Hospital. His
home for the past few years has
been at Union Hall, Va.
He was born on a -farm in
Rappahannock county, Va., on
January 14, 1825. He was edu- i
cated in the public schools and
University of Virginia.
Prof. Strother was a pioneer
educator and was well known
in this part of Missouri. For
more than forty years he has
been Supenintendent of Schools
in Monroe county and in 1855
conducted a private school at
Strother, which town was nam
ed after him. He was a county
school commissioner of Audrain
county for thrre terms a num
ber of years ago.
He began his career as a
teacher in 1844 at the age of 19,
when he went from his home in
Virginia to the State of Ala
bama and taught for six years.
This trip, of 1,000 miles was
made on horseback, Professor
Strother never seeing a train
until 1850. Upon his return to
Virginia he was married to Su
san Petty. In 1855, with his
wife and a trainload of slaves,
which he had inherited, he mi
grated to Misouri. He traveled
by carriage and wagon to Nash
ville, thence by boat to St. Lou
is, and then over the Santa Fe
trail to the Kingdom of Calla
way. He farmed there for two
years, but his inclinations for
school work were strong and in
1857 he purchased the Glasgow
Ladies' Seminary.

GOT NEGRO BOOTLEGGERS
Nine Arrested Monday Evening
i in Fulton.
Nine negro men and women
who were arrested Monday ev

charges of bootlegging, in Ful
ton, decided Tuesday morning
that they would stand trial, and
time for the trials will be set as
soon as Justice E. W. Herring,'
Prosecuting Attorney N. T.Cave
and Attorney E. L. McCall can
agree on a date. , ,
Nearly all the negroes are
old offenders and several have
served terms in the county jail
for bootlegging. The county
officials are sure they have suf
ficient evidence to convict every
one of the gang.
With nine negros in jail, wait
ing to be tried, and with 5 there
serving out sentences, the pris
on is crowded. The city cala

CITIZENSHIP"
under the control of the Pres
byterian Church and after man
aging the institution for a num
ber of years, and spending much
money in itsnniprovement, a
suit in Court decided that the
property belonged to the North
ern branch of the church, to
which branch the professor was
persona non grata, and he was
compelled to give up his lease.
By placing 'his membership in
the Northern church he could
have held the College, but he re
fused to do so.
After the death of his wife.
in 1897, he married Mrs. Bet-

She died in 1909. Two of his
children are living, Mrs. H. P.

Citizen I by birth or grant of court
Yet am I citizen T What this estate
Which gives me right to share in my
own rule ,
And all my country's progress help
dictate? . ,
It is to gain for me and mine alone
Some stronger hold on chattels that
breed power;
To constitute my property a throne
That mother's safety in an evil hour?
Or is it to enlarge my power to give
Such as I have of sense and strength
that they
Who likewise give, may find in me a
mate,
All of us working for a better day
When Justice to each woman, man and,
child
Shall challenge poverty and make for
peace;
When right, where'er assailed, shall
turn. .
Sure of a righteous nation's swift
release? "
If Lincoln lived and read this ques
tioning line.
What would his answer be? let that
be mine.
