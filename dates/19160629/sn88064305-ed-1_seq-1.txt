Company G of 13ogaalusa, uii.
der 'aptalin W. I). Schafer, who
was puit in command upon the
promlotion of former Capt. Louis
F. Guerre to Major, after several
days drilling in the city armory,
left Sunday morning for Camp 1
Stafford at Alexandria, where
they expect to be held for rigor
ous drill for 21 days, after which a
they will be carried to the Mexi. i
can border for active service.
A big crowd, estimated at from
4,000 to 5,000, gathered to say f
good-bye. The Great Southern I
Lumber Compay blew their large
siren whistle for five minutes, so i
that everyone would have ample
time to arrive on the scene. C
Company U formed on the Y. i
M. C. A. campus and. hetded by a
the Y. M. C A. brass band,
marched to Fourth street, where '
their special train of three coach
es and baggage car was waiting. fi
Just before boarding the train p
they were presented by Mayor (c
Sullivan, through Captain Led v
Blanc, with a beautiful silk flag, rr
given by the local Camp Fire i2
Club. Mayor Sullivan, on behalf b
of the city, made an eloquent ai
speech in bidding the men fare- s5
well. Great enthusiasm and pa. h
triotic ferver was evoked by bis c(
a.Rddress. Aimong other thlings hI
p said
o "You boys are startiung in tile
service of our country, and how I
wish that I was standing in the
I ranks by your side and by my
, own boy's side, wearing the uni
p form that mneans you are a soldier
a of the greatest nation on earth."
The compalny rosters up to 145,
arand besides the Bogalusa boys
includes 0. C. Doreimus, Hubert
Magee, Cecil Burris, Albert Sim
i mIn. and Ansil Foil, volunteers
r from Franklinton, and Gordon
SB ani-ter from Mt. Hernmon.

With the same desire for use

pr lompt ,bedience to order: which
(ch)arr;:ter'ize both officers and pri
vales ,I' this company, which is
made up of seome . f the finest cit
izens whiich any community could
boast, we of Washington Parish
are confident of seeing our repre

honor in whatever part of the d
conflict they may be.
GREAT SOUTHERN LUMBER CO.
TO PAY SOLDIERS' FAMILIES
Mayor W. H. Sullivan in his
usual big hearted and generous
fashion, is making arrangements
and with a band Qo patriotic citi
zens co.operating, institutiung
plans for financing the families of
the married men enlisted in Com
pany G while the soldiers are on
duty,.
In addition to. the Fourth of
July fund which was turned over
for this purpose, a certain amount
is to be paid monthly by the
Great Southern Lumber Company
and, also, a relief fund has been
started, and Mr. W. M. Babing
ton, cashier of the First State
Bank will receive all donations
for the soldiers.
This relieves the greatest hard
ship the soldier has to endure,
for neither his own physicial dis.
comforts nor the dangers of con.
filet will try his soul like the
knowledge that the dependent
ones at hoopl are siffering for tha1
necessities of liWe while he is away
fighting for his eotntry.
God bless the impulse which
started this beautiful movement,
and may the response to the sol
diers' relief bear out the state
ment made elsewhere in these
columns, that not all the heroes
of this war are found shouldering i
guns.

The Object in Cattle I)ipping.
There is a cotmmon, ulthough
erroneous, impressioti that the a
dipping ,,f catlle, is merely to get t
the ticks off ill.-mu; and while this a
is partly Irue, the chief part the
eattle play in the process is to
keep gat herizig ticks from the pas.
ture (tick-infested) until the ticks F
have all been gathered up and de.
stroyedin the dipping vat. If the .
dipping is kept up every 21 days, t
with-out fail, that will be the $
result, as the ticks develop on
the animal and fall off on an aver- d
age of 22 days From this it is C
seen that the 21-day dipping C
catches the ticks before they have u
had time to drop off and prodece
more ticks. The ticks that are
found on the animal between dip- n
pings are those that h~ew beto fl
picked up since the previoua i .~
ping and ahiob would be der. Ic
ed at the next 21-4ay dippit4g G
