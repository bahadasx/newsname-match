LOOKS UPON CONFLICT

Washington, June 2 it. A Pun-American
"police" force, composed of de
tachments of the armies of the United
states. Argentine, Brazil, Chile anil
other Latin-American republics to re-:-tore,
nut to erusch Mexico.
This is the suggestion brought to tlie
attention of the administration and
South American officials today from
certain quarters, which, it is believed,
will eventually lend to serious con
sideration of the project.

OF lan-Americanism yesterdar. To
those interested in further;.!, thL
American movement, the present crisis
l.etwecn the United States nnd Mexico
is regarded as n vital test of the priif
ciplea for which the powers of the Am
ericas have been striving.
Strife between nations of the Amer
icas would bo regarded by them as vir
tual civil war. They point out that
pvery trenty negotiated between Euro
pean powers lias fallen apart. With all
tne rest of the world divided, thev con
tend thnt the Americas must present a
nutted front, the nations of the two
continents must join interests diplo
nintically, commercially and industrial
Jy. War between any two of the Am
erica n nations would mean an immediate
division into groups, thus weakening the
entente and leaving the wav open at
the end of the European war for pos
sible influence, if not domination, 'from
tlbroad.
To preserve the strength .,,.:i.
t.ie Americas, Latin-American as well

interests of Pan-Americanism declare
it is imperative first that peace in the
Americas be maintained now and second
that n way be found to enforce contin

Says American Note Is Series

He WHI Correct
Mexico City, June 29. General Car-
rnnza's reply to the American note
threatening "grave consequences" if
the American forces are attacked and
reciting ulleged Mexican outrages will
nllege that several of President Wil
son's statements are based on unnutli
enticnled rumors, it was learned here
today.
The reply itself has not been complet
ed. But General Carranza himself in
dicated something of its character in
an address to a group of students last
night.
"The American
be an answer to tho. Mexican note, is in
reality not an answer at nil, but a se
ries of chnnriw " lut aulil in..l.r
is being prepared, rectifying these state
ments. The American note and the re
ply will be given to the public here as
soon as possible."
Referring later on in his address to
the possibilities of armed conflict, Car
ranza said:
"Mexico is the minnTl.ni of ibiu rn
We must defend not only the sovereign
ty of this country, lint iff nil ?.;.
American countries." .
The first Collies l.f tmnrifun nnu-o.
papers with the text of tho AmiMn
note were received her late ystrday.
They aroused intense interest. This
was the first publication of the note in
Mexico City.
