CARRANZA
o HIS ATI
Drder to Release the American I
Soldiers Held Prisoner is |
Now Confirmed.
TWO HOPEFUL" FACTORS
Activity of Transportation of
National Guardsmen Shows
No Relaxation Today.
( V AVtOCIATCO I
WASHINGTON. June 29?Mexl- I
an Ambassador Designate ArredonJo
today received a message from
Foreign Minister Aguilar confirming
lhat First Chief C arrant a had issued
orders to General Trevino to release
the American troopers captured ut
Carrizal and since held prisoners at
Chihuahua City.
Release of the American troopers (
hnn rptnovpil nnp ilnncerotiH element
In the Mexican situation but It was
apparent today it had only somewhat |
relieved and had not removed the 1
grave menace to continuance of 1
friendly relation* between the United 1 j
Ptntes and Mexico.
T5y freeing the prisoner* General
Cnrranza met only one demand made 1
by President Wilson. The other *
that Carranza declare his future atlitudo
toward the American forces
In Mexico remains unanswered until
the latest communication arrive*
from Mexico City. It was expected 1
today.
On the contin .ency that the Carranza
government may continue it*
policy of attacking American forceB
moving in any direction except
north, activities looking toward the!
speedy transportation of the national
guardsmen to the border!
showed no relaxation today.
There were two honeful factors in :
the situation, however. First, whatever
General Carranzn's answer may
be It probably will require further
diplomatic conversation and thus
hostilities may be averted, at least
temporarily. Second, many observers
believed the yielding attitude of
the Mexican government in the case
Df the prisoners indicates a tendency
which may be reflected in further
leal ings.
High officials of the administration
let it he known that the United States
? would proceed with its military opera- i
L J lions to adequately safeguard its citi- J
^ tens and territory and would continue I
to pursue bandits in Mexico whenever j
the. r was hope of overtaking them re-,
gardless of any action Mexican mill-,
tarv commander, may take.
To free itself from the menace of an
army mobilized on its northern frontier.
the Mexican government must
comply also with the demands that;
It police adequately its border states
and establish such firm military eon-1
trol there that raiding into the United
States is improbable nnd the assembling
of any large group of bandits |
impossible.
While such control Is lacking It is
clearly indicated here that President,
Wilson is determined by force if necessary
to employ the army either along
the line or in Mexico in such a way
as to insure the safety of American
lives and property.
DIVIDEND DECLAIMED.
