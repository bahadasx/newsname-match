' i non scout, captured by the Mexicans
at Carrlzal and subsequently confined

brought to the border at noon today
"to be turned over to the American
military authorities.
shout of laughter arose from, the
r thousands of Juarez. Mexicans, who
nf h3d gathered to see the arrival, as the
?I negroes filed from the special train.
j The prisoners were dressed in the
tcantiest and most nondescript garb.
,1 ,Some had on trousers. One wore a
!1 shirt while a towel encircled bis
3 waist. Others' heads were decorated
.9 ith bandanaa. . '
I Splllsbury Seems Anxious.
Spillsbury was dressed 'in a white
duck suit He appeared anxious. All
i the troopers were worn and drawn
from their experience, and all were
serious save one, who wore a broad
smile. ,, .. .,
This one man, himself the im
promptu spokesman of his fellows,
' "We sure are glad to get back.'
General Gonzales Meets Train.

'commander. and Andres Garcia,
Mexican consul in El Paso, met the

l! ted the 'prisoners from Chihuahua
The guard, dressed in uniforms ot
bright yellow, pushed back the crowd
formln- a lane through which Spills-
;' un and tie troopers marched down
. Z' railway tracks. They were taken
1 i to the disinfecting plant and mere

; urged ffm to accept this advice.
: . Mexicans Arrange Interview.
This interview was arranged at the
" solicitation of the Mexican off iciak
and before Splllsbury or any of the
Americans had a chance to see the
American officials.
I While Spillsbury was talking, Gen
'' oral Gonzelas sent out for food for
, ! hoVlsonerf who had had nothing to
': eat since leaving Chihuahua He
1 liter announced that it probably
1 I u Id be 3 o'clock in the afternoon
before u necessary red tape could
! - be gone through with and the prison
r ers transferred.
I Spillsbury Told to Obey.
J In his interview Spillsbury de
clared that he did not know who fired
, the first shot at Carrizal. He said
that after the second conference be-
tween Captain Boyd and General
Gomez, when ho advised turning back,
Captain Boyd said:
"I am the commander and it is ior
you to obey." , nn
I Splllsbury declared that there were
ibut 76 Americans in Captain Bojii s
force. He explained that when the
expedition left camp It was composed
of 8G men, but that at Santa Maria
10 were sent back to ,the main force
Tvlth a wagon train.
Spillsbury said, after he had been
.' told that It was his duty to obey, he
! advised Boyd that he at least should
. wait until the Mexicans fired on him.
1 Stoned By Mob.
Following the battle Spillsbury said
he and the other prisoners were tak
en to Villa Ahumada '-where their
' hands were tied and they were placed
aboard a train. They were stoned, ho
' said, while this was being done.
On their arrival at Chihuahua,
where they arrived minus the great
er part of their wearing apparel, which
had been stripped from them, they
were assaulted and stoned again. He
denied, however, that at any time
were the prisoners put to work clean
ing the streets.
Threatened With Hanging.
One terrifying moment came to
him, he said, in Chihuahua penitenti
ary when he' was threatened with be
ing hanged. He had been mistaken
for a Texas-Mexican and had been
dubbed a traitor, he explained. As
soon as it was found that he was a
white man and attached to General
Pershing's command, he was informed
that he was in no danger.
"We were well treated all the time
we were in Chihuahua," continued
Spillsbury. "The trip here was with
out incident."
Jeered on Way.
At Villa Ahumada on the return trip
the prisoners again were met by a
jerring crowd which, however, re
frained from excess. Spillsbury said
he would, return to the American side
with the other prisoners and would
offer his services to General Pershing.
While the prisoners were eating a
crowd gathered about the commandan
cia. The demeanor of the Mexicans
here as elsewhere was more- that of
curiosity than anything else. At every
point where the prisoners were viewed
restraint was exercised.
Accoutrements on Way.
General Gonzales announced that,
In order to make time, only one coach
had been attached to the train carry
ing the prisoners and that the horses,
arms und accoutrements of the men
were following on a later train. These
will be turned over to the American
authorities immediately upon their ar
rival at the border which is expected
either tonight or tomorrow, he said
General Pablo Ber-tani, who had ex
pected to arrive in Juarez in charge
of the special train, was not aboard
when it reached the border. Mexican
military authorities wore unable to
explain his failure to arrive.

MEXICAN CRISIS
STIILJMMIINT
Carranza Must Answer State
Department and Plainly De
fine His Attitude.
ARMY IS SPEEDING UP
Mexican Government Must
Comply Fully With De
mands of the United
States'.
Washington, June 29 Official an
nouncement of Carranza's order for
the release of the American troopers
captured at Carrizal reached the state
department early today from Special
Agent Rogers nt Mexico City. When
he sent the message last night Mr.
Rogers expected to be handed a reply
to the American note at any moment.
Danger of an immediate break with
the de facto government had been
relieved last night by press dispatches
saying the prisoners had been started
for the bonier from Chihuahua City.
Until Carranza replies to the demand
for a statement of his attitude toward
the American expedition in Mexico to
protect the border, however, the crisis
is only less imminent than It was be
fore. . , . i,
High officials of the administration
let it be known that the United States
would proceed with its military oper

and would continue to pursue

hope of overtaking them.

afterward came the dispatch from
Mr. Rogers. ' Eliseo Arredondo, Mexi
can ambassador designate, was advis
ed by Foreign Minister Aguilar iTi
Mexico City of his government's ac
tion. Speeding Up Mobilization.
Release of the prisoners had no
effect, however, on efforts to speed
up the mobilization of the national
guard along the international line
and to furnish an adequate supply of
war material to meet any emergency
Even should "the Mexican reply dis
claim any hostile Intention and with
draw orders to Carranza military com
manders offensive to the United
States the border patrol would be
maintained at the strength now con
templated while any danger from ban
dits continued. To free Itself from
the menace of an army mobilized on
Its northern 'frontier, the Mexican gov
ernment must comply also with the
demands that it police adequately its
border states and establish such firm
military control there that raiding
into the United States is improbable
and the assembly of any large group
of bandits impossible.
Carranza Explains Step.
In announcing he had been advised
by his foreign office of the order for
the release of the prisoners, Mr. Ar
redondo said his information was that
General Carranza had taken the step
"because he did not desire to aggra
vate the relations between the two
countries."
Arredondo Issues Statement.
Mr. Arredondo issued the following
statement, understood to be based
largely on the language of his dis
patch irom Mexico City.
"I have been confident from the first
that the American soldiers wolud be
released. From the time of their cap
ture until arrangements were made to
free them there was at no time any
other intention on the part or the do
facto government or its military offi
cials. The attitude of the first chief
has steadfastly been one of friendship
towards the United States, prompted
always by a desire to avoid conflict
and promote the welfare of both gov
ernments. In the situation that ex
ists it should be borne in mind that
it has not been brought about by any
act which could be attributed either
to the government or the Mexican
people but is due entirely to the pre
determined intentions of an irrespon
sible criminal."

FACTS ARE UNDISPUTED
Sir Roger Is Sentenced to
Death and Accomplice,
Daniel J. Bailey Dis
charged. London, June 29. Viscount Read
ing, lord chief, justice of England,
with black cloth by tradition called
a cap spread over his head and his
two associates in scarlet gowns, like
wise black capped, pronounced the
sentence of death for high treason on
the Irishman, Sir Roger Casement,
shortly before 6 o'clock this after
noon, half an hour after the foreman
of the jury in a shaking voice gave
the verdict of guilty. An appeal will
be taken by Sir Roger.
Sir Roger addressed the court,
reading his final statement with the
explanation that ho wished it might
reach a much higher audience than
the one before him and particularly
the people of America from whom had
come many messages of sympathy to
him and whose struggle for liberty, he
said, always had been an inspiration
to Irishmen.
Sir Roger's auditors, among whom
were Viscount Bryce and many other
prominent men and women, listened
in deepest silence, some moved to
tears.
Englishmen Not His Peers.
The prisoner declared he did not
regard trial by Englishmen in aji
English court as a trial of his peers
to which he was entitled. He re
viewed recent events in Ireland from
the beginning of the formation of the
Ulster volunteers and said:
"Wo have said the constitutional
army refused to obey the constitu
tional government and wo were told
the first duty of Irishmen was to en
ter that army. Small nations were to

reason why Ireland should shed any
blood for any people but her own."
Bailey Is Set Free.
After Sir Roger had been sentenc
ed Daniel J. Bailey, the prlvnte sol
dier who had been held as his ac
complice, was placed in the dock. The
chief justice instructed the jury to
return a verdict of not guilty ana
Bailey was discharged.
It was announced that the crown
had withdrawn the charge against
him. .
Sir Roger's Statement.
After the verdict had been return

long statement.

Already a struggle for existence
is disclosed among those left be-
with the utmost composure, smiling at
friends in the court room His state
ment, which occupied a half hour, was
a plea for the right to be tried by
Irishmen and for Irish nationality
London, June 29, 10.55 a. m. Serge
ant Sullivan, the Irish barrister upon
whom has rested the chief burden ot
the defense of Sir Roger Casement
in his trial for high treason, was un
able to appear- in court today and fin

livering an impassioned speech in
court last night
Artemus Jones, assistant counsel,
addressed the court
Mr Jones admitted that at the first
thought it seemed an outrage for Sir
Roger to go to Germany but he in
sisted that the defendant had attempt
ed merely to organize an Irish brigade
,for use against the Ulster volunteers
recruited by Sir Edward Carson. He
contended that the work Sir Roger
organized in Germany was precisely
the same sort of work ho carried on
in Ireland before the war. While the
importation of arms was a wrongful
act it did not constitute treason but
an offense against the Defense of the
Realm Act. Ho reminded the jnry of
the responsibility resting upon it.
Attorney General Sums Up.
Mr. Jones' speech occupied a little
more than half an hour after which
the Attorney-General, Sir Frederick
Smith, began summing up. He argu
ed that in days before the war Sir
Roger's defense might have had some
weight but "one circumstance, not in
significant, had intervened the great
est military power the world had ever
seen was trying to destroy the British
empire." .
The attorney-general dwelt upon the
trouble between the Irish parties. He
said the question he asked at the be
ginning why Sir Roger had gone to
Germany had never been answered
because no answer was possible. Sir
Roger had gone to make arrangements
to raise "the hideous spectre of In
surrection" in Ireland. The attorney
general's speech lasted for an hour.
Charge to Jury.
The chief justice began his charge
to the jury.
"Treason in time of war when all
persmons in this country are making
sacrifices to defeat the common ene
my is almost too grave for expression"
the chief justice said. "You must dis
miss from your minds all you have
heard, or read, outside this court. Wo
have heard much about politics in Ire
land. For myself, in the court of jus
tice, I always feel anxiety when po
litical passion is aroused. Pay no
more attention to what has been said
regarding conditions in Ireland be
fore the war or after the war, than
is necessary to consider the conditions
of this case "
After defining the law of treason
he pointed out that many facts in
the case were undisputed.
The jury retired at 2:55 o'clock p
m. Sir Roger was found guilty, and
later sentenced to death.
Is Not Ashamed.
"If that Is the reason, I am not
ashamed to avow It here. If the Un
ionists chose the road they thought
would lead to the good side I know my
road led to the dark side. Both of
us proved right. So I am, prouder to
stand here In a prisoner's dock than
to fill the place of my accusers.
"Self government is our right. It
is no more a thing to be withhold from
us or doled out to us than the right
to life or light, to sunshine or spring
flowers.'"
Throwing aside his manuscript. Sir.
Roger said:
"My lords I have done. Gentlemen
of the jury 1 wish to thank you for
your verdict. I meant no reflection
upon you when I said this was notji
trial by my peers."

Both Berlin and Vienna Claim Success
in Counter Attacks on Russians.
Petrograd, June 29, via London, 5:08 p.' m. Russian''
troops fighting in Volhynia and Galicia yesterday took pris
oner 22 1 officers ancf 10,285 men. says the official statement
issued today by the Russian war department.
The statement says the Russians inflicted a great defeat
on the Teutonic troops between the Dniester and Pruth rivers,
capturing three lines of trenches.
The statement continues:
"Yesterday General Letchitsky, after
artillery preparation, inflicted on the
en6my, despite his desperate resist
ance, a great defeat in the region be
tween the rivers Dniester and Pruth
and took possession of three lines of
trenches."
Heavy fighting in other sectors has
caused the intensity of the struggle
at Verdun to diminish. Another power
ful German attack last night near
the Thiaumont redoubt was checked,
Paris declares.
The British continue intense artil
lery fire and trench raids along their
lront in France and Flanders.
Both Berlin and Vienna claim pro
gress for the Teutonic counter of
fensive on the eastern front. The
Russian bulletin today claims the
catpure of 12,000 more Teuton prison
ers. Sir Roger Casement was found
guilty of high treason today, and sen
tenced to death.
Paris, June 29, 1:30 p. m After a
violent bombardment which lasted the
entire day, the Germans attacked the
French positions northwest of Thiau
mont in the Verdun sector, but were
repulsed with heavy losses, according
to an official statement issued by
the' war office today. The French
machine gun and certain fire is de
clared to have devastated the at
tackers. The statement adds:
' "In the Champagne destrict near
Tahure in a surprise attack we
cleaned up certain first line trenches
of the enemy and penetrated at sev
eral places a first and a second line.
Hero wo blow up a number of shelter
ing works."
Premier Briand Protests.
Paris, June 29, 5 29 a. m. Premier
Briand has sent a protest to the neu
tral pdwors against the action of the
German military authorities In order
ing the evacuation by civilians of the
towns of Lille, Rouhaix and Tourcoy
ing, according to the Petit Journal.
The protest is on the ground that the
order is contrary to The tjague con
vention. Fierce Fighting in Bukowina.
Berlin, June 28, G p. m.. via London,
June 29, 2:30 a. m. For several days
It had seemed that the fighting on
the Russian front had come virtually
to a stand still, the Russians having
reached the mountainous region of
Bukowina. which the Austrians had
selected for a strong stand, and that
neither side apparently was able to
make substantial progress in Volhy
nia. Today's laconic announcement In
the general staff bulletin of the cap
ture of Uuewka village in Vplhynia,
however, reflects an important Ger
man success, but it gives no indication
of the terrible fighting there. The
correspondent of the Lokal Anzieger,
writing June 23. says the fighting at
Linowka has been of the hardest
along the entire front.

British Violently Bombarding.
British Headquarters in France,
Wednesday, June 28, via London, Juno
29, 12:30 p. m. Unusually heavy
artillery firing with numbers of trench
raids, have continued all along tho
British front the last 24 hours. Here
and there were intense outbursts
from artillery concentrations on both
sides.
The British used both gas and
smoke to cover their trench raids. In
the Ypres salient were found the
bodies of Germans killed by gas. Tho
Germans retaliated" by bombardment
of the Canadian positions at Observa
tory ridge and Sorrel hill.
The ease with which raiding parties,
under cover of bombardment can bring
a trench, inflict losses and bring
back prisoners is such that it has be
come systematic nightly business
along tho whole front on a scale not
attempted before.
