American Rejoinder to
Austria Is Couched in
Vigorous Language.
MUST BE AN APOLOGY
Secretary Lansing Makes Public His
Reply to Austria Regarding Austrian
Submarine Attack on American
Steamer Petroliti S,ate L ' br HELENA
scribes the Act |
suit to Flag and Invasion or Hights
of American Citizens, and Requests
Prompt Apology, Punishment of the
Commander and Indemnity.
WASHINGTON, June 28. — The
American rejoinder to Austria regard
ing the Austrian submarine attack on
the American steamer Petrolite, made
public today by the state department,
describes the act as "a deliberate in
sult to the flag of the United States
and an invasion of the. rights of Amer
ican citizens," and requests a prompt
apology, punishment of the submarine
commander and payment of indemnity.
In vigorous language the communi
cation, sent a week ago today, makes
it clear that the United States gov
eminent believes the facts of the case
entirely different from what the Aus
trian commander reported them to be,
anil that immediate amends are ex
pected.
The Austrian claim that the Petro
life's captain voluntarily gave up sup
plies taken from the steamer by the
submarine commander is flatly con
tradicted, as are tho claims that warn
ing shots were fired across the Petro
lite's bow before she was shelled and
that her appearance was such as to
justify the submarine commander in
mistaking her for a cruiser.
The attack on the Petrolite, a Stan
dard Oil tanker, occurred in the Medi
torranean. A protest sent soon after
wards on preliminary reports from the
' ''nktu'B captain and crew brougl- the
Austrian communication to which tho
new American note replies.

II seems that Mr. 1
having his washing doi
ing homesteader's pin
miles north of Roy, uiid he always
called for his laundry on Saturday or
Sunday. lie failed ' to do this Inst
Saturday or Sunday and a small search
party was formed to see what had lie
come ot him, as inquiry disclosed the
fact Hint no one had seen him for
some days. This reunited in the body
fining found near a coulee, where
Billis had been cutting posts, lie had
been sluil through the chest with a
home made bullet from a Coil's .22
automatic. The oll'icers were Inline
dlately notified and the Inquest was
conducted at Roy Tuesday, when Mr.
Wright represented the state, Just lee
of the Peace Byron Clow representing
the coroner.
Some suspicious circumstances were
developed, but no direct evidence
could ho secured as to the actual kill
ing.
Came From Missouri.
Billis was about 22 years of age
and came out here from Mountain
City. Mo., and took up the homestead.
He was accompanied from Missouri by
young Jumps. The latter and John
Fink had been working for Billis, the
three men living in the Billis cabin.
Last Thursday morning Billis wanted
the others to get up quite early to
start in on some work, hut they do
clined to get out of lied and Billis
put a lot of sulphur oil tho stove and
tlie fumes soon forced them out. This
was not relied oil til all as tlie motive
for the killing, but it 1 h thought it
may have been a factor.
Tlie home made bullet extracted
from Billis' body is exactly like some
that the men at the cabin made for
use in a. Colt's automatic. Billis was
very well thought of In the neighbor
hood. lie was a quid, sternly, Indus
trious young man and unmarried.
