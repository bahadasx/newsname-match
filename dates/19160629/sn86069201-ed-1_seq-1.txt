and struck Mr Hob Scarbroth who was

tipg in the back, he was not otherwise
hurt.
LIGHT COURT DAY.
Monday was one of the lightest court
days ever seen in Lancaster, farmers
being too busy to come to town, con
sequently the crowd was small and
business dull. Several horses were
purchased for war purposes at $90. to
$127.60. A few mules exchanged hands
at $87.50 to $138.
Politics was at low ebb, neither
Helm or Montgomery being pesent.

eighteen years ago has been on a visit

stone showing a perfect Indian head
when held up to the light. Wo have

this kind of stone.

DECLARATION IMPORT
ANT IN HISTORY.
We are approaching the end of the
first half of the second century since
that band of patriots went before the
civilized world with the Declaration of
Independence, appealing to mankind as
a jury for a verdict between theAmer
ican colonies and the government of
Great. Uritian. The verdict in favor of
human rights immediately created pub
lie opinion against the rule of tyrants.
Today the rights of man cover the
earth as the waters the sea and the
world owes this marvelouj development
to those patriots who dared to defy
cngiano. anu a King.

0. BRADLEY.
A NEW HEMP
BREAKING MACHINE.
A Paris Ky, man has just invented
hemp breaking machine which, of
course "breaks out the fibre faster,
cheaper and better" than the old hand
brake. The farmer however will "have
to be shown", for it is almost an annual
occurrence for such an invention--to
make its appearance, and the farmer
invariably is compelled to return to the
time honored hand power machine.
W ith the present Increased crop and
the accompanying increase in price, the
growers would welcome the advent of
some machine that would get out the
fiber more rapidly and with less expense
LANCASTER BOYS EM

ENLIST IF YOU
ARE DISSATISFIED
WITH PRESIDENT WILSON'S MEXICAN
POLICY, OR SHUT UP.
Recruiting officers were here from
Richmond last Saturday seeking to en
list men to fill out the Richmond com
pany, which will in all likelihood, along
with other Kentucky troops, be sent to
the border and perhaps see service in
Mexico in the event of war. They sue
cenled in securing four recruits at this
place.
A notable incident of their visit was
the fact that among those who answer
ed the call were none of those who are
so frequently heard to make adverse
criticism of the policy of the Adminis
tration toward our southern neighbor.
There are a great many who are beard
to long and loudly exclaim against
"watchful waiting", to proclaim what
would have happened had "so-and-so
been present", or to declare that we
should have long since have declared
war against our rebellion ridden, neigh
bors, but when the call came and they
were given an opportunity to show
their patriotism by upholding a doctrine
which they have so long advocated,
verbally, they sought quIcK and sure
cover. These people are anxious for
war, provided always that someone else
does the fighting, but when the time
comet they are not to be found.
Our president has sought by all hon
orable means to lead this country along
paths of peace, has exercised much
forbearance, during all of which time
these blatanta have been proclaiming
for war, and now when forbearance has
ceased to be a virtue, and there seems
a probability of hostilities, thy who we
might first expect to join the ranks to
protect their country and avenge itsj
wrongs, have sought the dark, placet
away from the call of the bugle and the
eye of their fellow man.
