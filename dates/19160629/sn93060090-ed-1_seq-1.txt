We are inviting Odd-Fellows from all directions, And

take part in the Good Work. We have the

-subject to the judgment of a
-"broken law. - Hut for fear that
we might be misunderstood we
hall make our position more
definite. As far as defending
the cause of God or th9 Liberty
-wherewith Carbt has made us.
We are willing to give our life
if necessary in defeudiog it. .,.
The same liberty that our four
iatheri.of America faught for,
mo nrn readv to fight for.
But what we have refereuce to,
when we say that ve are oppos
ed towar. - It is the war tbat
makes the poor man fight, for the
rlch And then the rich turn a
..round, and make slayes out of
und of one soul; neither said aDy
of them that ought of the thiugs
which be possessed was his own
but tfhey had all things common,
. And with ereat power gave
the'Apostles witness of the res
urrection of tho Lord Jesus, and
great grace was up n them all.
NclCtier was there any among
them that lucked, for as many as
were Dossessors of landor houses
sold thorn and brought the prices'
of the things' that were sold, And .
laid them down at tbe Apostles
feet, and distribution was made!
to every man according as he
had need. (Acts: 4-32 3o )'
If their can be. any better gov
ernment then ia, we must say
that we never saw it, and not aa
much as heard of it, And for this

reverends and lawyers, th

brave preparedness people who
marched in that parada with
'waving fl-igs and, beating drums
and brass bands Merely played?
Prepared to go to slaughter
across 'the wild frontiers
where are they? now the call
goes forth for valiant volunteers?
Whv don't they form in line
agiin and tramp the streets
once more on to the recruiting
station and enlist to go to war'
I Where are these husky heroes?
Whet-care they, one and all?
Are they deaf and dumb and
blind as bits that they do not
heed the call? Why do they
skulk to cover? Why do they
shrink and shirk? And send
young boys mere children to
do their bloody work?
Put on the armour of1 God is
our advice and let .the nations
beat their swords into plow
shars and learn war no mere.
