Washington, June 29.—Austria's
probable reply to the United States
demand for reparation for the Aus
trian submarine attack on the Ameri
can tank steamer Petrolite was the
subject of widespread comment here
today. The text of the new Ameri
can note dispatched to Vienna eight
days ago was made public by the state
department yesterday-
The communication makes it plain
that to satisfy demands, the Austrian
government must promptly apologise
for the attack, punish the submarine
commander and pay an indemnity. It
describes the attack of December 5
as a deliberate insult to the American
flag.
After recitng the circumstances of
the attack the note says:
Text of Demand.
"The conduct of the submarine
commander showed lack of judgment,
self control, or wilful intent amount
ing to utter desregard of the rights of
a neutral.
"According to the sworn statements
of the captain of the steamer and a
seaman who accompanied him to the
submarine, the commander of the-lat
ter stated that he mistook the steam
er for a cruiser. This statement is at
variance with the statement in the
Austro-Hungarian government's note
that the captain of the submarine as
serted a false mahieuver on the part
of the steamer prompted the sub
marine to continije to flre.
"The captain of the steamer swears
he Informed the commander of the
submarine that he had only sufficient
provisions to reach the pbrt of Al
"flew, and that, hft jwaulil deliver pro
visions only under compulsion. He"
states positively in his. Affidavit' and: In

SHARP DEMAND FOR APOLOGY
IS MADE TO AUSTRIA THE
PETROUTE CASE BY THE II. S.
Conduct of Austrian Submarine Commander Denounced
in the Latest Note Sent Eight Days Ago and Just
Made Public by the American Government.
Qpnyeraafidtf with officials of the de
'rtartm^ht that he did not give pro
visions readily rior did he say it was
the duty of one seaman to help an
other, and that he refused payment
because he felt that he was being
1
compelled to deliver food in violation
of law. The statement of the captain
of the Petrolite is entirely at variance
with the report of the submarine com
mander.
Seaman Held.
"The correctness of the captain's
opinion that the wounded aeaman was
held as a hostage to guarantee the de
livery of food sesms clear.
The outrageous conduct' of the sub
marine commander and all the cir
cumstances of the attack on the Pe
trolite warranted the captain as re
garding himself as being compelled,
in order to avoid further violence to
deliver food to the commander of the
submarine.
"In the absence of other and more
satisfactory explanation of the attack
on the steamer than that contianed in
the note addressed to you by the for
eign office the government of the
United States is compelled to regard
the conduct of the commander of the
submarine in attacking the Petrolite
and in coercing the captain as a de
liberate insult to the flag of the Unit
ed States and an invasion of the
rights of American cttisens for which
this. government requests that an
apology be made that the command
er of the submarine be punished, and
that repm-atlon be made for the in
juries'sustained by the payment of a
suitable Indemnity.
Expect OompUanoe.
"Please communicate with foreign
officers in sense of foregoing.
"You may add that' this government
believes that the Austro-Hungfurlan
'guwetnnuea^ will promptly combte
with these requests, .in vieWi trf lKwr
mafclfett jttstness and the high fense
of honor "-ef that" government wlilqn
would not,' it is believed, permit an
Indignity to be offered to the flag of a
friendly power or wrongs t6 its na
tionals by an Austro-HUngarian naval
officer without making immediate arid
ample amends."

the. 2,000 trucks which it was: last
night announced, had been purchased
by the government would be sufficient
to handle the supplies, it Was esti
mated- of an army of 600,000 men.
T.he 4.000 trucks mentioned In .Col
onel Smith's announcement today will
be constructed for immediate deliv
ery, although all of them will not be
put into service at once.. They are of.
two classes, some of three tons and*
the otherB of one and a half tons.
Attaches of the staff of Major Gen
eral Leonard Wood regarded the plans
indicating that the war department
had determined' to place greater im
portance upon this automobile trans
port service than upon the govern
ment's naval transports. It was point
ed out that of the five vessels of this
class only two are on the Atlantic
coast.
It is now believed that prices of
commodities average at top notch,
and that although there will be, as
always, variations of prices, the aver
age will go no higher.

There Is nothing definite on other state positions, except that if

railroad commission candidates, commissioner of agriculture, commis

yesterday's terrific storms, however, have tied up all wire service

JUDICIARY BAIiDOT.
For Justices of the supreme court in a field of eight candidates,
Messrs. Hoblnson, Birdzell and Grace, candidates endorsed by the
Nonpartisan league, are polling almost the total Nonpartisan league
strength, running dose together, and the prospects are that they will
be the highest candidates.
Justice Fisk seems assured of nomination, but beyond that nothing
Is yet definite, returns being so scattered and the vote being appar
ently well distributed between four other candidates. Adamson of
Devils lake, however, seems out of the running, leaving the other two
places on the ticket between Spalding, Burke and Goes.
On all returns available, N- C. Macdonald Is leading W. E. Hoover
for superintendent of public instruction, but under Nonpartisan law,
both candidates sre nominated.
BURKE ANJD M'ARfTHUR.
In the democratic primaries, John Burke was given very lime
difficulty In obtaining the senatorial nomination, defeating F. O. Hen
Strom by at least three to one, and probably four to one.
Democratic gubernatorial returns are incomplete, but McArthur
has a lead at present, and unless strong sectional returns should over*
turn the general trend of balloting, he has been nominated.
In every comity where Nonpartisans are organized their legisla
tive candidates have taken the lead, and indications are that at least
eighty per cent of their candidates for the house of representatives have
been nominated.
