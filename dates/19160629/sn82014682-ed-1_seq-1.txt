Route Chosen By Directors
Menaces Seminary Grounds
; ' J Says Dr. Rhee "
J Directors of the Country Club face
a lawsuit if they attempt to have the
much discussed Puunui road "cut
through the grounds of the Korean
girls seminary.
Dr. Syngman Rhee, principal of the
seminary, this morning sent to the
Star-Bulletin a copy of a letter of pro
test he Is filing with the city. .' His
letter, giving a new angle on the Puu
nui road controversy, is as follows:
-Korean Girls' Seminary, Puunui,
June 29. 1916.
The Honorable the Mayor and
Board of Supervisors, City and County
of Honolulu. - - C
"Gentlemen: I understand that the
directors of the Country Club pro
pose to have the upper road from
Puunui to Nuuanu avenue cut through
the middle of the grounds of our sem
inary. 'lf this were done it would ruin the
grounds for the purpose of the school
and I protest most vigorously against
the entertainment of any such pro
posal. "Our school as an educational in
stitution of great benefit to the
growing youth, should not be discrim
inated against in iavor of the Country
Club, aa association, with enormous
property, conducted only for pleasure
and amusement Such a proceeding
would amount to a scaudal and reflect
forever on the good name of the su
pervisors. "The presence of any road running
through these grounds would be such
a detriment to them that my duty to
the seminary, would impel me to place
the matter in my lawyer's hands to
contest it to the utmost of his ability.
"RcspectfuiJy,
