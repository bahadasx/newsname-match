Recall Against
Greer Defeated
The recall election instituted
against Chairman B. R. Greer of tho
springs water commission was defeat
, ed Monday by the voters of Ashland.
Mr. Greer scored a victory In every
ward. Tho total vote in favor of re
calling Mr. Greer was 598, only 69
more votes than appeared on the re
call petition which was signed up hy
a systematic canvass of the city. The
total vote opposing the recall was
C57. The total vote cast was 1,255,
the old sjirit of "leave it to the other
fellow" preventing the turning out
of a full vote.
M. C. Heed, 'who allowed his name
to be used on the recall as candidate
against Mr. Greer, received 594 votes
against 637 for Mr. Greer. Friends
of Mr. Greer estimate that a differ
ence of perhaps two or three hundred
votes was swung over against him by
an attack made In the churches and
backed by wild charges against the
Bungalow dancing. Since Monday
Investigation of those charges made
by prominent church members have
proved them groundless.
After the results of the election
had become known Monday evening
friends of Mr. Greer kidnapped him
and, attiring him In chaps, spurs and
cowboy rigging, put him astride of a
saddle cinched on a Ford car and
drove him through the streets at the
head of a riotous procession. At the
entrance of the park Mr. Greer ad
dressed a crowd of several hundred
who had gathered, proclaiming a
w ish to have personal spite forgotten
and the entire community unite in
getting behind the Ashland climate,
water and scenery and, by their co
operation, build a city.
Medford Band Will
Be Here Three Days
The Medford band will be here for
all three days of the big celebration
next week. The Medford band is a
well-balanced organization and will
be a valued addition to the celebra
tion music.
On the first of last April Medford
citizens entered into a contract with ;
Reginald G. Rowland to take, charge 1
of their hand. Mr. Rowland, who by
birth is Welsh, spent fifteen years In j
Canada. During that period he was
A'traMn ff cAvorol rtf HanaAa'e host
UIIUl; IU1 VI nV'Vll V.. Ml. uuu W u.uvi
bands. For four years just previous
to coming to Medford he was band
master of the 88th regiment Fusiliers
of Victoria, B. C, which band had
the distinction of being one of the
foremost military bands of the coun
try. When the 88th regiment was
ordered overseas Mr. Rowland ob
tained his discharge and took up ne
gotiations with Medford. The citi
zens of Medford are to be congratu
lated on securing Mr. Rowland's ser
vices. The wonderful transformation
of the Medford band in two months
has more than proved his ability. Mr.
Rowland is a cornetlst of repute,
composer and arranger. His band
will feature next week's programs
with several of his compositions and
rearrangements.
Rand Resigns as
Association Manager
D. E. Rand, manager of the Ash
land Fruit and Produce Association,

accepted last night, and on the 15th
of July he will go to Wenatchee to

and Mrs. Rand have made a host of
friends in Ashland who will regret
seeing them leave. Mr. Rand Is an
experienced fruit association man
whose departure will be a loss to the
association.

two men actual mining operations
were begun on the 250-foot level this

We hev bed the circus fever, and the itch for county fairs.
We hev lied the baseballitlB and them one horse street affairs
That they call a grand carnival, we hev hed 'cm all, by jing.
But there's nothln' stirred us home folks like this new Shoe-talk-way
thing..
Ma's been savin' of the butter money since the news got to our place,
And the boys hev been affected by amazin' works of grace,
They are up without a callln' hustlln' off to ti ed the stock,
And they're puttln' all their coppers In an old gray woolen sock.
Mother sez to me this morning we wiijs t;ilMn' 'bout the thing
"It's been thirty years this summer since I wore this weddln' ring,
I ain't asked for much vacation. I've been happy tollln' long,
But I'm goln' to Shee-talk-way till 1 get plumb drunk with song.
"All my life I've been jlst hungry for to hear some things like this.
Seems there ain't a thing that's coniin' thet I Just can bear to miss.
I spose there are a lot of t) 'ngs I ought to do that week,
But I want to hear them slners sing and hear them speakers speak."
Gosh, It seems that these old eyes hev been almighty blind,
I ain't been no hard taskmaster, I hev wanted to be kind,
But a sort of grlppy feelln' ketched my heart to heat the band
When I seen the calloused place on her qulverln', wrinkled hand.
Then I thought about that mornln' when we left the parson's place.
Comin' up here to my clearln' I kud see her snillin' face
I kud hear her voice a singln' sweeter'n a meadow lark,
'Xen I reached and tuk her hand In mine, Jes like we used to spark.
And I sez. "Molly, by cracky, you get fixed to go to town.
I'm jes achln' fer to buy ye a brand new Shee-talk-way gown.
I've been selfish, I'll admit It. I've a lot of things to rue.
I have thot a heap for Henry and I ain't thot much fer you.
"But we'll take in this Shee-talk-way If the whole plantation skids.
It will make this year worth living fer yerself and fer the kids.
I spose there are Borne things to do. but dern 'em, let 'cm rest
Till we git the inspiration, then wo'll tackle 'em with zest."

As she says, "I've alius wanted just to hear somebody slug,
Somebody to give expression to the music of my life
That's been humniiif through my heart-striri'.'s ever since I've been

Then I swallered hard and said I guess I'd biitr feed the stock.
I kud hear the birds a-slngin with the tiekin' kitchen clock;
All around outdoors wuz sunshine, trubble all seemed gone and,
say,
We'll be like a pair of lovers goln" to that Shee-talk-way.

NOTICE TO
Attention is hereby called to Ordinance No. 284 relating to

5 and 6, and which act has been provided for by special ordinance
recently passed and approved and which display I think comes
within the meaning of "safe and sane," and which I believ is suf
ficient in the way of entertainment along that line, I am
constrained not to exercise my right set forth in said Ordinance
No. 284, that we may avoid the danger to life and property and
annoyance attending the use of same generally, hence said ordi
nance will remain In full force and effect on - all three days.

Woman Ropes
Outlaw for Rodeo
Klamath Falls Herald: Quite a
roping feat was accomplished by a
Klamath county woman last week,
when Mrs. Will Sims successfully
roped and captured "the wild stal
lion of Bowles creek," who has been
sought in vain for some time by
stockmen of Klamath and Modoc
counties. This Is considered quite a
feat, considering the horse's great
reputation for cleverness in avoiding
capture.
Mrs. Sims was out with her hus
band, who has a contract to deliver
ten outlaw horses and twenty wild
horses for the Ashland round-up.
The stallion will be sent over as one
of the wild horses, and he ought to
give considerable trouble to the vac
quero drawing him In tho wild horso
rare.
Sims has rounded up Rim-Rock
Johnny, Skylight and eight other bad
burkers for the Ashland show. They
are all In fine condition.

Medford and Weed were overtaxed
with those seeking admittance, and
many were turned nway.
For these all-Important games
Medford has signed Siebert, the Btar
pitcher for O. A. C, and have also
signed two other crack players which
fills up all the weak spots in the
Medford lineup.
Weed likewise Is overlooking no
opportunity and is drawing on all of
the available talent In California for
these all important games which are
to decide the baseball supremacy of
southern Oregon and northern Cali
fornia for the season of 1916. Ken
neth Lilly, former Ashland Btar, Is
playing sensational ball with Weed.
The games will be called Immedi
ately after the morning parades.
