TUCUMCARI, QUAY COUNTY, NEW MEXICO, THURSDAY, JUNE 29, 1910

BUILD NG
ASSURED NQWUPTO
LI
About $7600.00 ItiiR nlrcndy been
subscribed for the building of a rail
road Y. M. C. A. in Tucumcnri. Tho
citizens committccH have been busy
and havo scoured tho town. Many of
our citizens linve not yet decided what
they desire to give, while others tmy
they will raise their subscriptions if
it becomes necessary. Scc'y Day left
Tuesday night satisfied that Tucum
cnri would do her part and the mat
ter Ik now up to the railroad company.
This very nenrly gnurantccs that tho
building will be built und Tucumcarl
may well feel proud of this splendid
achievement and shows what a little
push and assistance from tho livo cit
izenship will do for our town.
Tho committees met very few who
could give nny reason whntover why
a Y. M. C. A. would not be a good
thing for Tucumcari. Some men who
could hardly spare the money, sub
scribed liberally and did it freely, while
some who could have afforded more
were slow to sign.
Tho building proposed will be a mod
ern 2-story ntructure with bnsemcnt,
which will be used as a swimming pool
arranged in such a way that tho water
used will be filtered and purified mak
ing it sanitary in every respect; bowl
ing alleys, billiard tables, reading and
rest rooms will be among the special
features. A big auditorium will also
be built in connection where public
meetings will be held. Tucumcnri will
be greatly benefited by the establish
ment of such a building and tho boys
will bo made bettor both physically
and morully.
The citizens committcs are short but
$500 or $000 of the amount to be rais
ed. The railroad men have been de
layed by the immense business of tho
road making it very near impossible
to see the men and register their sub
scriptions. The shop men have re
sponded liberally and aro to bo con
gratulated for the interest they havo
shown.
LAND VALUES INCREASE
Albuquerque, N. M., June 29. Work
ing voluntarily on their vacation timo
Charles T. Kirk, professor of geology
and John D. Clark, professor of chem
istry in the University of New Mex
ico, aro nearing completion of nn eco
nomic and resources survey of the
land holdings of the University which
it is estimated conservatively will udd
fully half n million dollars to the pros
out market value of tho lands. The
survey was begun Inst summer by the
two department heads and a corps of
students. It will bo completed about
September 1st and the totnl cost to
the University will bo a few hundred
dollars. Last summer was spent in
tho northern half of tho state. This
summer the work carries the profes
sors and their staff into Valencia, Me
Kinley, Socorro, Sierra, Grant nnd
Luna counties.
While little information has been
given out as to the results of tho sur
vey, it is known that valuable infor
mation has been secured which has en
hanced vnlues enormously. Tho work
has been done with scientific thorough
ness by two men who aro expert in
the work and tho result in an econom
ic appraisal which enables the Univer
sity to Hit an accurate and intelli
gent present-day vnluo on its lands;
and whnt is even more importnnt, it
makes it possible to estimate probable
future values. Possibilities of devel
opment havo been brought to light on
a number of tracts which had not been
made which :ro of largo value, not
only to the university holdings, but to
adjacent lauds. No land buyer has
over had a more careful examination
made of a prospective purchase than
has been made of tho University's
hugo rcal-cstato endowment and the
first result has been to give tho Uni
versity itself considerably more re
spect for that endowment than itTiad
before. Completion of the report and
its publication, is certain to produce
an equal chnngo in the public estimate
of tho vulue of these lands. Tho es
timate, roughly, of half a million dol
lars of added value as a result of tho
.survey, is based on tho work dono in
tho northern half of tho state last
summer. It is anticipated that even
greater increases will follow tho ex
amination of tho lands in tho south
ern half, which is now progressing.

COMPANY
TRAINING CAMP MAY UE
ESTABLISH El) IN TUCUMCARI
Thoso who took tho matter up in
regard to the establishing of a mili
tary camp or training plnco for new
recruits, have received word from au
thorities at Washington. They say all
arrangements have been made for the
disposal of the present troop now mov
ing townrd tho border, but lator c
Tucumcnri would bo considered ns a
favorable place to establish such a
camp.
Tucumcari has splendid wntor and
plenty of it; good level ground for
camp life, excellent locations for an
instruction camp, just the light dis
tance from the border.
When one regiment or more of mil
itia was ready for service on the bor
der another could bo brought here for
training.
CAUGHT TWO RUN AWAY HOYS
Two M-ycnr-old boys were cnugnt
here last Friday. They were mut
iny their way to El Paso to sco tho
big doings down there. Their names
were Charles Todd and William Brace
and were sons of well-known men of
Dalhnrt, Dr. Todd being one of the
leading physicians of that place.
Thoy rodo most of the way to Lo
gan and hoofed it to Tucumcari. The
boys were not so tired ns one might
think but were determined to continue
their trip to El Paso. Ofllcinls were
notified that they would reach Tucum
cari and to be on tho lookout for them.
They were taken into custody nnd tho
relatives notified. Money wus tele
graphed for tickets and thoy returned
home Saturday morning. Thoy no
doubt thought it was a long way to
Tucumcnri, when u person has to walk
most of tho way.
THE EVIIL OF TRAVELING
ON DEFLATED TIRES
A man came in hero tho other day,
said Mr. Tarploy of the Ford Garage,
who hod driven his car several miles
on tho rim, n tire having been punc
tured somo distance away from town.
The walls of the cusing were scored
and scraped, while the fnbric, which
was torn nnd frayed, was broken away
from the rubber, and the beads were
badly damaged. All this trouble was
caused by the squeezing of tho casing
between the edges of tho rim and the
ground. Inside the casing, small ir
regular shaped pieces of tho tubo wero
adhering to the fabric. All these evi
dences of abuse were conclusive proof
that both casing and tube were badlv
injured if not ruined beyond repair.
All things considered, it's expensive
business, traveling on deflated tires.
It's far cheaper, says Mr. Tarpley to
carry a spare, as every sensible mo
torist does, now-a-days, but still there
are a lot of shortsighted men who go
along without an extra tire, hoping
that tho inevitable will never hnnnen.
and then, to cap the climax, thoy come
in tor nn adjustment: I would ad
vise every motorist, said Mr. Tnrpley
in conclusion, to read a good instruc
tion book on tho care of tires, such a
book for example as that issued by the
.mchclin lire Company.
BOY KILLED WHEN

Saturday about noon while Mrs. J.

Tho News wishes to deny tho report

RAIN BADLY NEEDED HERE
Rain is bndly needed on tho range,
but cattle between hero nnd El Paso
are still in fairly good condition. Tho
dry land crops around Tucumcnri can

and not suffer greatly. Farmers aro
learning how to conserve moisture and
their crops can withstand more drouth
