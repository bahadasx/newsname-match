In another column of this is
sure will be noticed an article
announcing a joint picnic of all
the Sunday Schools in and around
Tracy City.
This is a splendid movement
and all people who attend Sun
day School and Church services
at any Church should be present
Those who aren't regular mem
bers of any Sunday School will !
be welcome to enjoy the hospi-;
tality of all. It will do you good
I Will Save You
MONEY!
HAVING purchased the entire stock of General Merchan
dise from JNO. A. OLINE, I am now ready to save you
money. Here is a proposition that you can't turn down.
For every $1.00 cash you spend here you
will get $1.10 cents worth of Goods. This is
for a limited time only.
I also wish to thank all the former patrons of this store
for their past patronage and hope for a continuance of the
same.
to come. At this time, every
man and woman, regardess of all
all previous conditions, church
doirnias and hpliVf. will lavasidft
such petty beliefs, and if there
be hatred there would be no
more hate and all men and wom
en, bos and girls be true broth
ers and sisters. This is a fine
plan and the ones who urged it
are to be commended. It is hop
ed that the plan will be contin
ued from year to year.
As it has been heretofore, the
various Sunday Schools have
mustered together their crowds,
and have had separate picnics.
There are many objections to
this. Chief of these is the lack
of members. -; No picnic will be
as much enjoyed if there aren't
many of your chums, special
friends, and those you enjoy
being with, as one will be if you
have all these. Sunday Schools
which have a large number of
men and women are lacking in
boy9 an 1 girls, those lacking
in men an 1 women may have
a large number of boys and girls
but few young men and women.
But with us all together, we'll
have youn and old, boys and
girls, young men and women.
Everybody should have a good
time,-, v - J ,
Candidatas for the various
county offices which, by all
means, be present. Several have
already said they would be there
with their families. It's a good
time to receive the good old
handshake of these men. Look
out upon the multitude, Mr
Office seeker. Being citizens
of the same town and county, we
should value our fellow citizens
more highly. We can force our
selves out of the old rut, the old
way of thinking and get new
thoughts and ideas. sWhile we
may differ in our belief as to
church dogmas yet we all believtj,
or at least should believe in the
brotherhood of God, and brother
hood of men. If we have these
essentials well grounded in our
lives, the minor points will lqok
after themsleves. Let us all go
to the picnic July 4th.
I will treat you right
