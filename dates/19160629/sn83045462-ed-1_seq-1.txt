The dispatch merely said Consul
Garcia had telephoned Gen. Bell that
the soldiers had been ordered freed
and were en route last night from (
Chihuahua to Juarez, at which point t
they were expected to arrive this ,
morning.
Mediation Offers Are Kenewed. a
Ignacio Calderon. minister of Bolivia.
and Rafael Zaldivar, minister of
Salvador, called at the State Department
today to renew their efforts to
l^arn whether the United States would | *

Mexican difficulty.
The minister reminded Mr. Lansing
of the interest of all the American republics
in preservation of peace, and
aid he would call again when Carranza's
reply to the note of the United
St >'tes had been received.
President Wilson considered the situation
sufficiently relieved so that he
took a trip to Philadelphia to address
the Associated Advertising Clubs of the
World.
High Tension Is Relieved.
Danger of an immediate break with the
de facto government had been relieved I
last night by press dispatches saying the '
prisoners "had been started for the border
from Chihuahua City. Until Carranza replies
to demand for a statement of
bis attitude do American expedition
in Mexico to protect the border. J ]
however, the crisis is only less imminent
than it was; before.
High officials of the administration let
it be known that the United States would
proceed with its military operations adequately
to safeguard its citizens and territory
and would continue to pursue bandit*
Into Mexico whenever there was hope
of overtaking them, regardless of any t
action Mexican military commanders may t
take.
Secretary Baker carried to the White
House early a copy of Consul Garria's
message to Gen. Bell at El Paso, stating
that the men were en route to the
border last night. Soon afterward came
the dispatch from Mr. Rodgers. Ellseo
Arredondo, the Mexican ambassador
designate, next gave notice that he
was advised by Foreign Minister Aguilar.
In Mexico City, of his government's
action.
No Effect on Mobilization.
It was apparent about the War and
State departments today that release
of the prisoners had made the situation
less critical. It had no effect, however,
on efforts to speed up the mobilisation t
of the National Guard along the international
line, and to furnish an ade- i
quate supply of war material to meet '
any emergency.
Even should the Mexican reply dls
claim any hostile intention and with- j
draw orders to Oarranza military com-J
manders offensive to the United States.1
the border patrol would be maintained |
at the strength now contemplated while . ]
any danger from bandits continued. \}
To free itself from the menace of j
an army mobilized on its northern ] 1
frontier the Mexican government must i
comply also with the demands that itii
police adequately its border states and :
establish such firm military control!,
there that raiding into the United
States is improbable and the assembly
of any large group of bandits impossible
Determined to Employ Army.
While such control is lacking, it is
clearly indicated here that President
Wilson is determined, by force if necessary,
to employ the army either along
the line or in Mexico in such a way as
to insure the safety of American lives
and property along the border.
There were two hopeful factors in the
rttuation.

EL PASO, Tex., June 29.
?Twenty-three negro troopers
of the 10th Cavalry and
Lem Spillsbury, Mormon
scout, captured by the Mexicans
at Carrizal and confined
in the Chihuahua penitentiary,
were brought to the
border at noon today and
turned over to American
military authorities.
A shout of laughter rose
from the thousands of Mexicans
who had gathered to
witness the arrival as the
negroes filed from the special
train. The prisoners
were dressed in the scantiest
and most nondescript garb.
Some had on only trousers.
One wore a shirt, while a
towel encircled his waist.

All the troopers were

This one negro made himself

for his fellows.
"We are sure glad to get
back," he said.
EL PASO, Tex., June 29.?Unexpected
slowness of the special
train bearing the twenty-four
American prisoners released in
Chihuahua City by Gen. Jacinto
Trevino on the emphatic demand
of "President Wilson today delayed
their return to the American
side.
Announcement that the train
would arrive early in the morning
drew a big crowd gathered at the
American end of the international
bridge to greet the returning
negro troopers of the 10th Caval
ry and Lem H. Spillsbury, the
Mormon scout. The escort for
the returning captives, provided
by Gen. George Bell, jr., marched
upon the scene at 8 o'clock.
Hours passed, however, without
the Americans putting in an
appearance. The crowd sweltered
under the hot sun, and was made
more uncomfortable when word
spread in the middle of the forenoon
that the arrival probably
would not take place before 11 130
a.m.
Mexican officials did not explain
the delay. They insisted
that the prisoners could have met
with no mishap, as they were under
heavy guard.
Shortly after 11 o'clock Gen. Gonzales
I said ne nad received a telegram stat!
iner that the sneeial train would not
arrive until 12:30 or 1 p.m.
If there are any Carranza troops in
Juarez they did not appear today while
Gen. Francisco Gonzales and Consul
Andres Garcia waited for the special
train. Only the recently armed Juarez
"home guard" patrolled the streets.
Gen. Pablo Bertani. recent Carranza
commander at Casas Grandes and later
at Madera, is in charge of the prisoners'
train.
Trevino Send^WoTd of Release.
Late yesterday afternoon it was announced
from the coramandancia in
Juarez that a message had been transmitted
over the Mexican telegraph
which stated that the twenty-three negro
troopers of the 10th Cavalry and
Lent H. Spillsbury, Mormon scout, had
been removed from prison.
tvi? mpssaefl added that thA
with their arms and accouterments, under
heavy guard, had been placed on a
Mexican Central train bound for

this morning.

was signed by Gen. Jacinto Trevino.

are at Chihuahua City.
Gen. Bell Maintains Silence.
Gen. Bell, in keeping: with his custom
of maintaining: close secrecy regarding:
all military developments, refused
to say whether he had received
the message. He sare that all announcements
must come from Gen.
Funston at San Antonio:
On receipt of word that Gen. Funston
had given out the contents of ths message,
he said no escort would be sent
to meet the prisoners in the morning:,
but an officer would be delegated to
take command of them and lead them i
to Fort Bliss.
Mexican officials last night were '
happy over the turn in events. They
said this would mean a lessening of the
tension of the last few days. Gen.
Francisco Gonzales, Juarez commander,
and Andres Garcia. Mexican consul at ]
El Paso, each said he regarded the incident
as reassuring.
"This shows that we don't want war
unless it is forced upon us," Mr.. Garcia
said.
Preparing Army for Offensive.
SAN ANTONIO. Tex., June 29.?Staff
and denartmental chief 8-at Gen.
Funston's headquarters continued today
the work of shaping: the hourly
increasing army for a possible offensive
movement. Notification that Gen. Carranza
had ordered the surrender to
American military authorities of the
negro troopers captured after the. fight
at Carrizal was received with gratification.
but it did not lower in the least
the high pressure of military preparation.
The opinion was widespread that the
release of the prisoners had not altered
the basic reasons for the mobilization
along the border of a great army and
that the danger of an open break with
Carranza's troops that parallel the international
boundary had not been
greatly lessened.
Trains bearing certain units of eastern
National Guardsmen were expected to
cross the state line during the day and
by night it was believed that a considerable
part of the newly made army
would be nearing stations along the
border.
Supplies were being concentrated at
Brownsville, Laredo, Eagle Pass and other
points fcrhere the greater concentrations
will be made, while quartermaster department
officers here were piling up stores in
San Antonio and adding to the alreadylarge
warehouse space.
Army Buying Horses and Mules.
The purchasing of norses and mules
' ? frwlav under the first con
was uuuc? ???v v?? tract
ratified yesterday by the War Department.
Buyers of horses and mules
appeared today with herds they had secured
from Texas farms and ranges, and
army inspectors appeared pleased with the
condition of the mounts, declaring that
the ?grade appeared slightly better than
European buyers had been getting.
Reports from border commanders indicated
no clash of any consequence with
Mexicans. The slight exchange of shots
between outposts near Brownsville was
not regarded as serious. Reports that
came from the- Mexican lines indicated
that the Carranza troops had not relaxed
their vigilance, notwithstanding the
order to release the prisoners , at Chihuahua.
I
The troops continued their concentrating
movements south of Matamoros and
at other points along a line paralleling
the border, although in most cases the
points of greatest concentration were
several mues in ine mienor.
National Guardsmen Cross Border.
COLUMBUS. N. M., June 29.?For the ,
first time since their mobilization on
the border National Guardsmen today
are in Mexico qn military service.
Three motor trucks were loaded with
New Mexico guardsmen last night and
dispatched down Gen. Pershing's line
of communication to help guard
against its being cut. !
This action was taken following receipt
of a report that large forces of
Carranza cavalry had been concentrated
at or near Guzman, on the Mexico
Northwestern railway. Such troops
would be in a position to interrupt the
American communications, which are
only ten miles distant from Guzman.
A large number of remounts, which
left here yesterday for Gen. Pershing's
headquarters, were ordered
turned back by the American commander
because of fear that the reports
might be true.

CRICHTON'S REMAINS FOUND.
Body -of British Viscount, Missing
Since November, 1914, Reinterred.
LONDON, June 29.?Germany has
notified Great Britain, through the
American embassy, that the body of
Maj. Viscount Crichton has been found
and reinterred. This is the first definite
information the family has had of
the fate of Lord Henry William
Crichton. who has been missing since
November, 1914.
Viscount Crichton was born in 1872
and was a member of the Royal Horse
Guards. He had been missing since
November, 1914, and had been reported
a prisoner in the hands of the
Germans. His father, the Earl of Erne,
died in December, 1914. The latest records
of the ueerasre name Viscount
Crichton as the new Earl of Erne, but
owing to the fact that he was missing
say that his successor to the title was
uncertain. Viscount Crichton married
Lady Mary Cavendish Grosvener,
daughter of the Duke of Westminster,
and their son, the Hon. John Henry
George, born in 1907, therefore becomes
Earl of Erne.
Bri&nd Protests German Order.
PARIS, June 29.?Premier Briand has
sent a protest to the neutral powers
against the action of the German military
authorities in ordering the evacuation
by civilians of the towns of
Lille, Roubaix and Tourcpying, according
to the Petit Journal. The protest is
on the ground that the order is contrary
to The Hague convention. ,

Lord Chief Justice Delivers Charge
After Attorney General Attacks
Evidence of Defense.
LONDON, June 29.?Sir Roger Casement
was found guilty today of high
treason. The ending of the historic trial
came shortly before 4. o'clock this afternoon,
when the jury, which had been out
less than an hour, brought in its verdict
against the Irish knight. He was sentenced
to death.
After the verdict had been returned
Sir Roger began to read a very long
statement.
After Sir Roger had been sentenced
Daniel J. Bailey, the private soldier who
had been held as his accomplice, was
placed in the dock. The chief justice directed
the Jury to return a verdict of
not guilty, and Bailey was discharged.
Todav's session ; of the court was
given over to arguments of counsel and
the charge to the jury. Sir Roger's
chief counsel, Alexander Sullivan, who
collapsed in court yesterday, was unable
to appear today and his argument
was taken up by Artemus Jones,
assistant counsel for, the' defense.
The attorney general. Sir Frederick
Smith, summed up the case for the
prosecution, after which the lord chief
justice delivered his charge.
Arguments of Mr. Jones.
Mr. Jones admitted that at the first
thought it seemed an outrage for Sir
Roger to go to Germany, but he insisted
that the defendant had attempted
merely to organize an Irish brigade
for use against the Ulster volunteers
recruited by Sir Edward Carson. Mr.
Jones was proceeding to argue that
this did not constitute treason when
the chief justice interposed. He explained
he would direct the jury that
the law was that "giving aid and comfort
to the king's enemies meant assisting
the king's enemies in the war
with this country, and that any act
that strengthened or tended to
strengthen the enemy in the conduct
of this war againfet us would be giving
aid and comfort to the king's
enemies, and that any act which weakened
or tended to weaken the power
of this country to resist the attacks of
the enemy was aiding and comforting
the king's enemies."
Mr. Jones contended that the work
Sir Roger did in Germany was precisely
the same sort of work he carried
on In Ireland before the war. While
the importation of arms was a wrongful*
act, it did not constitute treason,
but an offense Against the defense of
the realm act. He reminded the jury
of the responsibility resting upon it,
saying:
"This trial may mean a tragedy to
the prisoner on account of the responsibility
resting upon you. The ancient
and valiant race from which this man
springs nas proaucea men wno ao not
shrink* from going: to the scafiold for
what they think are the rights of
their country."
Attorney General Stuns tip.
Mr. Jones' speech occupied a little
more than half an hour, after which
the attorney general. Sir Frederick
Smith, began summing up. He argued
that even if the defense which Sir
Roger s lawyers had attempted to set
up was a valid one the e^dence in the
case had in nowise supported it. In
days before the war Sir Roger's defense
might have had some weight, but
"one circumstance not insignificant
had intervened?the greatest military
power the world had ever seen was
trying to destroy the British empire."
The attorney general dwelt on the
truce between the Irish parties. He
said the question he asked at the beginning?why
Sir Roger had gone to
Germany?had never been answered
because no answer was possible. Sir
Roger had gone to make arrangements
to raise "the hideous specter of insurrection"
in Ireland.
The Germans, Sir Frederick continued,
were not people who gave much
for nothing. They were not going to
Iroort enlHiprs nf th#? Irish hriprari#? ac
their guests so that they might go
after the end~of the war to free Ireland.
The attorney general's speech lasted
for an hour, in which time ne dissected
the evidence in an exhaustive manner.
He delivered no peroration, but reminded
the jurors his duty was as painfufl
as theirs. He said he had discharged
his duty and they must perform
theirs.

to muster them last, as the^ could not
be taken into the service until there
was a full regiment.
If any of the companies wmcn went
into the service with their minimum
strength of sixty-five men lose any on
account of physical examinations it
will not in any way delay the movement
of the troops from this camp,
according to Capt. Edwin W. Fullam,
adjutant of the 3d Infantry. The men
are then in the United States service,
and will not be held back because they
fall short of the minimum allowance.
Final Mustering This Evening.
This afternoon Capt. Hobbs is scheduled
to muster the cavalry and two
batteries of field artillery- This will
complete the tactical units, and the entire
District guard then will be in federal
service. This leaves only the
; brigade headquarters to be musterdd.
I When this will l?e done is not now
known. _? /
Brig. Gen. William E. Harvey, coraf
manding the District of Columbia
! militia, together with his adjutant general,
Maj. Harry Coope, went to the
War Department today for conferences.
It is probable that the question of
mustering Gen. Harry and Maj. Coope
was takep up at that time.
There seems to be some uncertainty
as to when any of the organizations
will move out of this camp. The Signal
Corps has been mustered for several
days, but has received no orders to
move. It, like all of the other organizations
in the guard, has been awaiting
proper uniforms and equipment for the
men.
Three carloads of equipment arrived
at Rosslyn today. One of the cars was
opened before noon and was found to
contain all shoes. It is now being unloaded.
The other twq cars also are
believed to contain foot equipment
This shipment will fill one of the very
important needs of the troops now in
camp, as the mustering: officer reported
several days ago that 50 per cent of
the men did not have a serviceable pair
of shoes. Work of fitting the shoes to
these men will be started immediately
and this detail will be gotten out of
the way.
Ball Ammunition Issued.
It Is the general belief now of the
camp officers that the 1st Separate
Battalion will entrain before tomorrow
night. With that idea in mind,
ball ammunition is being issued to this
battalion, so that as soon as the men
are outfitted with shoes, clothing and
other equipment they can start light
for the trains. Approximately 102.000
rounds of rifle ammunition and 30.000
rounds of pistol ammunition was issued
this morning to this battalion. However,
it was served out in bulk and
will not be distributed to the troops
until their arrival at Bisbee.
The medical examinations of this
troop were completed today, and it is
understood that quite a few of these
troops were rejected on account of bad
teeth.

physical examinations this morning:, and
this afternoon the work of examining: the
troops will be started. The eight officers
engaged in this work have been working
day and night in order to put th>e troops
through quickly, and it was suggested today
that if there was an urgent call for
the troops of the 3d Infantry and other
organizations there are about forty officers
of the Medical Reserve Corps now
in Washington who could be called upon
to assist in the work.
It will take several days, perhaps until
Saturday night, to complete the physical
examinations of the infantry alone. It is
estimated that it will be late Saturday
night pr Sunday before the 3d Infantry
will be ready to move to the destination
at Bisbee, Ariz.

xenseness iix ^auip acucvcu.
Although the mustering is being
pushed with all speed possible, there is
not the hustle and bustle about camp
which was shown following the tilt between
Carranzistas and United States
cavalrymen at Carrizal. The determination
of the Mexican authorities to release
the prisoners has relieved the
tenseness which was felt in this camp,
but still the troops are anxious to get
to the front in order to be there in
preparation for eventualities.
Attention of all the camp officers
now is being focused on supplies and
equipment. This is what they want
and it is the only matter which is holding
them back. They are using every
effort to get the men fitted out as
quickly as possiDie ana get tnem start*
ed for the front.
Brig. Gen. Harvey announced today
that Assistant Secretary Vrooman
would come to camp at 5:30 o'clock
this afternoon for the purpose of delivering
a lecture to the enlisted men
who were employes of the Department
of Agriculture. *
Mustered In Yesterday.
The entire 1st and 2d Battalions and
Company I of the 3d Battalion and the
machine gun company were mustered in
yesterday. As some of the men had been
sent out on details, nearly all of thea<
companies failed to present their full er
listed strength for muster. Companies
and M had left camp for the rifle (an
