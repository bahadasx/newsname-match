"When is the street railway com
pany going to have the line to the
park in operation, ana when are they
going to open the natatorium?" are
questions asked a dozen times each
day, and one answer will suffice to
answer both questions. Mr. Putnam
stated a few days ago that the line
would be in operation as soon as work
and money could get it in shape to
run. The company has been working
with might and main to get affairs in
shape to operate the line. Men have
been at work on the tracks, and a
force of car repairers are now over
hauling the cars so when the line is
ready to start the, rolling stock will
be in first-class shape.
Mr. Putnam went to Chicago yes
terday in the interest of the company
and will probably purchases added
equipment while there. lie assures
the citizens that the line will b3 a
credit to the city when it is completed
and will probably purchase added

stated that they were in contempla
tion and would be made as soon as
the company has straightened out the
old tangle which it acquired when
it purchased the system.

PRILL NATIONAL GJARP
THE KIDS OF
OF PLEASURE.
A GREAT DEAL
The kids are up in the air. Hut
than the city officials think it better
that tlx: ki.ls bhoul.l be up in the air
than for some valuable buildings to
go up in smoke and for that reason
there will-'be strict watch kept on the
quality and quantity of the fire crack
ers and other noise producers during
the coming fourth of July.
There is a strict ordinance relative
to the use of fire works of every des
cription wiihin the corporation limits
of the city, and the city officials
state that they are going to see that
it is observed.
Mayor Mullen and the chief of police
do not assert this to hurt the feelings
of the small boy because they were
kids themselves long time ago but
it is for the protection of property that
they are determined to see that Ard
more is not visited with a severe fire
caused by careless use of fireworks j
during the celebration of the glorious
fourth.
Ardmore merchants have learned j
this lesson in the past and tile stock of
lire works on display in all the stores
would not do very much damage if
they were all touched off together. It ,
looks like a safe and sane fourth in j
chh; city. 1

BIG BOOSTER
MEETING FDfl
GOOD ROADS
THE CONVENTION HALL WILL BE
FILLED TOMORROW NIGHT
QUESTION OF VOTING BONDS
FOR ROAD PURPOSES.
Farmers from all over the county
will attend the big good roads meet
ing Friday night at the convention
hull and it is expected that a great
crowd will be on hand.
With thousands of dollars available
after July 1 from the oil tax money
for use on the county -roads, the busi
ness men believe that with the co
operation of the farmers that some
splendid work on the roads can be
done tills fall and u wave of good
roads enthusiasm lias spread over the
city and county. The good roads
committee will have a detailed re
port to make at the meeting, which
will be comprehensive and 1o the
point, and the members feel that if
their recommendations are carried
out that Carter county will take an
advanced step toward getting out of
the mud and sand.
So great is the Interest enst of Ard
more that a delegation from McMil
lan will be on hand. Provence, Iiaum
and Mulkey will also send delega
tions. It is being pointed out that
there are sections of the county which
have been neglected and that trade
is going to other places which would
otherwise come to Ardmore, and
which is in the legitimate trade ter
ritory for this city.
Max Westheiiner says: "We will
have to get busy and rone of us have
so much to do but what we can afford
to give this road matter actual time.
I'm ready with time and personal ef
fort." J. W. Krueger says: "The mer
chants cannot do anything more prof
itable than to help get these roads
passable between now and fall,"
Mark Kirkpatrick says: "There is
not a business man or professional
man in Ardmore but wliat will jump
into the traces on a definite line of
action. We have delayed too long
already, and I am boosting the meet
ing all the time."
S. A. ;pie says: "There is no ar
gument about good roads. It Jooks
like we are getting down to real busi
ness now, and I look for the dirt and
sand to fly. I hope every business
man and working man in the city will
be on hand Friday night."
Everybody is urged to be at the
meeting Friday night. The county
commissioners, the city commission
ers and county and city school au
thorities are also being urged to be
present to lend their voice and pledge
their support to a concrete movement
for good roads. All who come are
asked to come meaning business,
ready to discuss propositions which
will arise fully and to take decisive
action and stand pat on them after
they have. The campaign will not
stop at Friday's meeting, but a cam
paign is to be made in every township
in the county.
Used Less Cotton Seed.
Washington, June 29. Cotton seed
crushed from the 1915 crop totaled
4,201,059 tons as compared with 5,
779.66a tons of 1914, the census bu
reau announced . today.
Washington, D- c- Junt 2J-
Spi'fial Atfent Kodgers at
Mexico City today oilicially re
ported Carranza's order to re
lease the American prisoners at
Chihuahua, saying also that
he expected to receive Carran
za's reply to the Washington
note momentarily.
The danger of an immediate
break with Mexico appears to
have been relieved by the re
lease of the prisoners. Until
Carranza replies to the demand
for a declaration of his policy,
however, the crisis is only less
imminent than before.
The American troops will be
kept in Mexico and the large
border patrol maintained and
augmented as planned.
Senate Approves Resolution.
Washington, D. C, June 29.
The senate today approved and
sent to the White House, the
conference report on the Hay
resolution, authorizing the
president to draft into the fed
eral service all national guards
men, taking the prescribed
oath.
Urging Mediation Again
Washington, D. C, June 29.
Ignacio Calderson, minister
of Bolivia, and Rafael Zalvidar,
minister of Salvador, have re
newed their efforts with secre
tary Lansing to learn whether
the United States will enter
tain a mediation offer of the
Mexican difficulty. Lansing
said he could not discuss it now
in the absence of official infor
mation regarding the release of
the prisoners, or Carranza's
final reply.
Immediate Break Averted.
Washington, June 29. An Immedi
ate break between Mexico and the
United States government has appar
ently been averted by the compliance
of the Carranza officials with the Am
erican demand for the release of the
cavalrymen taken prisoners In the
Carrizal battle and incarcerated In the
prison at Chihuahua City. News of
the release of the prisoners at Chi
huahua readied Washington last
night In press dispatches. While it
is conceded that this move lessens
the tension and makes the crisis less
imminent, no one conversant with the
grave problem is losing sight ot the
fact that the all important question
'of Carranza's attitude toward the Am
erican expedition on the Mexican side
of the border to protect territory and
citizens of the United States from
outrages remains unsettled. If the
Carranza government stands upon the
orders to General Trevino to attack
Pershing's men when they move oth
erwise than- toward the border, the
situation actually is just what it was
before except that there is now a pos
sibility of diplomatic negotiations,
which did not exist while the Ameri
cans were held prisoners In Chihua
hua. The preparations of the United
States for war will go steadily for
ward. There will be no interruption,
of the rush of national guardsmen to
the border and General Funston con
tinues disposing the forces under his
command as though he expected an
Immediate attack from the Mexicans.
The fact that Carranza has complied
with one ot the American demands is
accepted by the more optimistic of
ficials here as an indication that he Is
striving to prevent a break with the
United Stat-
