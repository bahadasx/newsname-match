FIRST CHAUTAUQUA
For Princeton Will Open Next Satur-
day and Continue to July 5A
Splendid Program Assured.
It is a Community Event and One That
Should Be Made a Memorable One
Help the Guod Cause Along.
Princeton has never had a cnautau
qua. This yeai, however, we will have
a Chautauqua, and it will be a good
one.
The chautauqua will be held on July
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. It will be five days
an length with two full programs each
day. A lady supervisor will also con
duct the Children's chautauqua each
morning. A stage manager will be on
the grounds at all time to take care of
the arrangements
The chautauqua will be in this city
at a time when everyone will need a
little outingthe warm weather per
iod. And it will be under a large
tent, cool and inviting. It should be
the home coming time and reunion
time for all relatives and friends.
Those who ha\e gone to other places
should be nmted to come back home
for chautauqua week. Many of them
will gladly come and enjoy the time
with you. Get away from the daily
routine of the home and from the
daily grind of business for an hour or
two each day, and recuperate at the
chautauqua.
It is a community event, and should
be made a great one. Make it serve
the community and the town in the
widest way possible. Do this by in
viting those from the country and
nearby towns. It is for them to en
joy and get the benefit to be derived
therefrom. The kind of boosting that
will bring the best results and the
most lasting to the town, is the boost
ing done by the business men and the
citizens for the chautauqua.
Ihe program to be given is high
class every waynot a cheap num
ber in it. Not one or two high spots
and the balance cheap, but all of it
from the start to finish is the best the
country affords. In fact it costs the
people more than they can afford to
pay unless the entire people realize
the opportunity and support the chau
tauqua.
The name Bertram means excell
ence, and it is the proud boast of the
Bertram Chautauqua system that they
give nothing but the best. They have
spared neither time, labor or expense
to make this program pleasing, enter
taming, informing and inspiring.
There will be plenty of wit and hu
mor, great chunks of fun for every
body. If you do not want to laugh
until your sides ache then you had bet
ter stay away. Some of the most de
lightfully humorous lectures, clean
comedy in songs, readings and plays
He who has not laughed has lost the
day, and the apostles of laughter and
sunshine wins more days and puts
purity and cheer in more hearts tha^
any other human living.
Then, there will be the sublime ora
toiy, moving eloquence serious and im
portant truths presented in the most
able manner. You will learn some
things that you never knew before,
and you will be better informed on the
great topics of the day.
Do you lo\ music Do you like the
kind of music that thrills the world
in the great centers of population
where the great artists gather and
w7ork?
On account of a long circuit
the chautauqua brings it to your very
doors for a few pennies. You will
have a chance to hear the only Danish
Grand Opera Singer America, Ma
dame Florence Bodmoff of the Royal
Opera, Copenhagen^ and her Four
Mendelsshon Girls one of the finest
male quartettes the country also
Jalma's Symphony Ensemble of Min
neapolis, a great musical organiza
tion that will be a musical treat to any
community, and many others of equal
note and talent.
Season tickets cost $1.50 each for
the entire chautauqua, and that is 15
cents per session. And any session
will be worth the price of a season
ticket.
Don't forget the Children's chautau
qua, free to all the little tots and the
boys and girls. Give them a chance
to attend.

tire five days appears hereunder:

Modern House Aids in Liking Country.
The farm boy or girl likes to live in
a good house, the house better adapt
ed to being made a home, say men in
the United States Department of Ag
riculture.
It is not necessary to go to the city
to get a modern home. A farm home
can be built for three or four thousand
dollars that wTould
fi^whpmlMWKm'iifflW'^^

R. C. DUNN, Publisher. Terms, $1.00 Per Year. PRINCETON, MILLE LACS COUNTY, MINNESOTA, THURSDAY, JUNE 29, 1916.
cost nearly twice
as much in the city. A lighting and
heating system can be installed as
cheaply in the country and kept up at
a much smaller expense than similar
conveniences can be kept in a city
home.
The amount of money necessary for
taxes and for public impro\ement is
almost negligible to the farm-home
owner. To the owner of the city home
it is considerable.
The amount of money to be invested
in the building of a farm home should
not be determined by its relation to
the balance of the plant in size nor the
amount needed to provide a shelter. Io
should be the amount the owner may
resonably afford to spend without
financially crippling himself too se
verely, says the Department of Agri
culture. The average city home is
bought as a social investment. The
buyer looks to the comforts and con
veniences that he can get in the new
home that can not be supplied in a
rented house. He does not think of
how much he can sell the house for
when he no longer wants it. He knows
he can not sell it, oftentimes, for as
much as he must pay for it in the first
place.
The better farm home is not a pan
acea for all ills of dissatisfaction with
farm life. There will be farm boys
and farm girls who will want to take
up other professions than tilling the
soil. The problem, continues the De
partment of Agriculture, is not to
force them to stay on the farm, but to
make conditions good enough there
that they may make an intelligent
choice.
An Historic Weapon.
The pistol of Gavrio Pnnzipwhere
was the weapon made? And those
bullets that killed the archduke and
the archduchess of Austria at Sara
jevowhere were they fabricated?
One could write an epic around that
weapon. Had those pieces of lead
strange and fantastic dreams as they
lay fast to the earth, undifferentiated?
Did those minute particles know what
a tremendous thing they were to do in
the hands of Fate That pistol should
be set under a glass case in some
museum, like Shelley's heart or the
bones of some anarchic saint, for fu
ture generations to ponder on, for
there was a divinity that moulded
those chunks of lead.Life.
Do It Now.
For each hour that you rest now,
jou'll moan later. If you put off a
thing in June because you are tire I,
statistics show that you will not b-i
likely to get it done when the weather
gets hot in July.
One will do 15 per cent less work
when the temperature is 75 degiees
and 37 per cent less when it is 86
degrees than he will when it is 68.
These are the results found by the
New York state commission on venti
lation, in an investigation of labor
conditions there. In the case of les
sened work, the person had the choice
of doing oi not doing.
The power to do work is not changed
by the temperature. One can do as
much work with a temperature ordi
narily high as he can when it is fairly
low. But when it's hot, he must know
that he has to work. He does not do
so because he enjoys it.
Princeton Town Obser\es Road Day.
Princeton village failed to observe
Good Roads day, but a portion of the
township did itself proud. Good work
was accomplished under the super
vision of Otto Polsfuss. He managed
to enlist twenty-five men in the cause,
and, as a result, a quarter of a mile of
the road leading to Long Siding im
mediately from the east has been ma
terially improved.
The entire day was put and the
men had their dinner with them.
Hereunder appears a list of the
names of those who volunteered their
services. Those who have the word
"team"' following their name contrib
uted a man and two horses to the
worthy cause:
Otto Polsfussteam.
A. N. Johnsonteam.
W A. Snowteam.
Fred Eggertteam.
R. Jaemcketeam.
E. E. O'Brienteam.

Andrew Larson.
Arthur Polsfuss.
Wm. Lipp.
Bert E. Starkenburg.
Gust Minks.
Rudolph Jacobson.

This was the only observance of the
day in this vicinity, and the public
spirited citizens of Princeton township
are deserving of commendation.
Anotber Letter From Snelling.
Tom Olson received a letter from
Grover Umbehocker, who is with Co.
at Fort Snelling. Grover reports
that the boys arrived at camp Mon
day morning and started pitching tents
immediately. On Tuesday they were
gnen five and one-half hours to drill.
Two bales of hay were allotted to Co.
for bedding purposes, and Grover
says that each one of the boys strad
dled a straw and enjoyed a sound sleep.
In the morning he became acquainted
with the fact, however, that there were
a few bones in his body that he never
knew the existence of before.
Mallette-Bradshaw.
Dr. L. B. Mallette of Princeton and
Miss Amy Bradshaw of Kansas City,
Mo., were united in marriage at the
latter place this morning. The groom
is a popular and rising young profes
sional man of Princeton, and a host of
friends extend felicitations. The bride
is not a total stranger to our people,
as she has visited friends here on var
ious ocasions, and she will be wel
comed as a resident of our village.
Dr. and Mrs. Mallette expect to arrive
here next Monday.
Vote in Adjoining Towns.
At the recent primary election the
vote for Kellogg and Eberhart for
United States senator in the Six Sher
burne county precincts adjacent to
Princeton was as follows: Baldwin,
Eberhart 18 Kellogg 31 Blue Hill,
Eberhart 10, Kellogg 22 Livonia, Eb
erhart 9 Kellogg 53 Orrock, Eberhart
28, Kellogg 42 Santiago, Eberhart 18,
Kellogg 22 Zimmerman, Eberhart 8,
Kellogg 35.
Miracle is Right.
The Ogilvie ball team trimmed up
the Foley aggregation Wednesday af
ternoon by a score of 11 to 3. See
ing that the game was played on the
Foley grounds, it seems nothing short
of a miracle that the visitors won.
Foreston Independent.
Olson-Thorne.
Mr. Knute Olson and Miss Ida Louise
Thorne were made man and wife
by Justice Dickey this morning.
They are both from Isle, and have the
well wishes of all.
Attention, G. A. R.

Company G, seventy-six strong, left
Princeton Monday morning at 6 o'-
clock, for Fort Snelling, where the
Minnesota state troops will mobilize
for United States service.
The Mexican situation is decidedly
serious, and it is expected that the
Third regiment, M. N. G., of which
the local company is a part, will be
called to the border in the immediate
future.
Sunday evening Princeton citizens
gave the boys a farewell reception at
the Airnory. Supper was first ser\ed
to the boys, and the G. A. R. veterans,
and relatives of the Milaca recruits
were invited to partake of the same
also. It was an appetizing repast pre
pared by the ladies of Princeton, and
a bevy of charming young ladies served
the viands.
Immediately after all had been
served, the bugles sounded, and the
company lined up along the north and
west walls of the Armory. Captain
Johnson then called upon Attorney C.
F. J. Goebel of Milaca, for a few re
marks and he appropriately responded,
emphasizing the need of preparedness.
Mr. Goebel has three sons who ar&
members of the Guardtwo of them
are affiliated with Co. of Princeton,
and one is a member of a Minneapolis
company. Mr. R. C. Dunn was also
called upon, and he delivered brief but
feeling farewell remarks to the boys.
Mr. J. A. A. Allen of Milaca was
present, and he stated that the finest
HISTORICAL
SOCIETY
young men of his village were mem
bers of the company, and that citizens
there would stand by them. Mr. H.
J. Plaas then presented the purse,
mention of which is made elsewhere
in this issue, to the company, and Cap
tain Johnson accepted same on behalf
of the members.
Shortly after 9 o'clock a regular
program was carried out at the Arm
ory. Dr. H. C. Cooney presided, and
the exercises opened with a couple of
selections by the high school orchestra.
A chorus of young ladies under the
direction of Mrs. C. A. Caley then sang
"America," and the entire audienca
rose and joined in. "Columbia, the Gem
of the Ocean'' was sang next, and then
Rev. Samuel Johnson, of the Congre
gational church delivered a farewell
address. It was an appropriate and
fitting effortinspiring and patriotic.
The chorus again favored those pres
ent with a song, giving "The Battle
Hymn of the Republic," this time. Rev.
Fr. Willenbrink gave a fine talk next,
and he emphasized the necessity of in
tervention for the sake of humanity.
The chorus was again called upon, and
it responded with "Yankee Doodle,"
and the "Star Spangled Banner," which
brought all to their feet. Attorney E.
L. McMillan spoke briefly in his usual
pleasing manner, and Judge Sanford
responded to a call with appropriate
farewell remarks. Captain Johnson's
name was called and he was roundly
applauded when he appeared, but all
efforts to have him address the gath
ering failed. A selection by the or
chestra concluded the program.
Hundreds of citizens were on hand
bright and early Monday morning to
bid the boys farewell. The loyal la
dies prepared breakfast at the Armory,
and the boys more than appreciated it.
After the roll call of the company
was taken, the boys formed in regu
lation marching order and went to the
depot. The platform was crowded
with parents, wives, sweethearts and
friends of the boys, and they carried
with them the best wishes and prayers
of each one there.
The patriotic people of Mille Lacs
county are proud of Company G. The
company is composed of the best young
men of Princeton, Milaca and the ad
joining towns. They are clean, manly
boys, and whateyer fate has in store
for them they will not be found want
ing. They will acquit themselves as
Minnesotans always have in the past
when their country called them. That
each and every member of Company
may return to their homes and loved
ones the Rum river valley with
health unimpaired, is the fervent wish
of all.
NOTES.
Max Cordiner joined the colors Fri
day and donned a Kahki uniform.
A total of 24 young men from here
abouts have enlisted since the order
for mobilization arrived.
Wm. A. Bandemer and Emil C. Ban
demer enlisted Saturday evening.
Clifford Reiber and Francis O. Hurley
also signed enlistment papers Satur
day.
Quarter Master Hofflander found
supplies to equip 73 men writh
blankets,
uniforms, shelter halfs and ponchos,
but there were not near enough guns
to go around.
The members of the company oc
cupied the Armory for sleeping quar
ters on Thursday, Friday, Saturday
and Sunday nights. Straw ticks wrere
supplied them.
Those at the depot Monday morning
gave the boys a cheerful wxr of part
ing, but the happiest expressions
failed to cover a choke in the voice of
those giving them.
Quarter Master Hofflander wras
ex-
tremely busy during the week. Be
sides supplying the boys with their
regulation outfits, he took an inventory
of the ordnance and supplies of the
of the company.
Co. is made up of a splendid lot
of young men from the Rum river
valleyPrinceton, Milaca and the sur
rounding sections are represented.
They are our sons, our brothers or
our chums. God be with them.
Friday morning Captain Johnson
led the boys through a three mile
hike. Little Mark Doane adopted the
company, and trudged along with the
boys Friday. Mark was at the armory
every day, and he was as enthusiastic
a patriot as any of them.
Nimrod Hanson and Edward Ander
son arrived here from Pettibone, N.
D., Saturday evening, both being mem
bers of Co. G. They reside at Milaca,
and were with "Billy" Bennett's show.
Bennett's show was hit hard by the
order for mobilization, as three of his
band men belonged to Wisconsin com
panies and were forced to leave.
Arthur Roos arrived here from Min
neapolis Friday evening. He is a
member of the company and promptly
VOLUME XL. NO. 28
responded to the call. Ralph Olm
stead, also a member of the company,
arrived from Minneapolis the same
evening. He was in the employ of the
Minneapolis Gas Co., and his pay will
continue while he is in the service of
the United States. Besides his posi
tion will be open to him upon his re
turn. Numerous of the large em
ployers of labor are standing Presi
dent Wilson's acid test of patriotism
splendidly.
"Mike" Writes From Snelling.
The send-off that Co. got when
they left Princeton last Monday morn
ing is now ancient history but never
theless it will remain long in the
hearts of the officers and members of
the company as one of their most
treasured memories.
'Mid cheers and tears the Company
pulled out the the Princeton depot
promptly at 6 a. m. Monday morning
for mobilization at Ft. Snelling. The
baggage was all loaded, the men and
all their equipment ready and no de
lay in the start of the special was
caused by any "unpreparedness" on
the part of the home company.
The first stop of the special was
made at Anoka, where Co. B, Third
regiment, with Captain Caswell com
manding, was picked up. Anoka gave
their boys a grand send-off at the de
pot. The next stop was made when
the train was transferred to the Mil
waukee road and here Co. I of Crooks
ton was picked up. These three com
panies were then taken right out to
the Fort and the business of unload
ing, pitching tents and getting the
camp ready was on in full swing. The
first day in camp was devoted to this
work, and on Tuesday the regular
camp routine was taken up and this is
comprised principally of three parts,
%iz: Drill, drill and more drill.
They are putting things on a war
basis as rapidly as possible and all
pomp and ceremony has been done
away with at one fell swoop. This, no
doubt, will be the regular program un
til either this war scare blows over or
the boys actually entrain for the bor
der for active service.
NOTES.
This afternoon the Company took
their first mnoculation for typhoid
and had considerable fun out of it tell
ing the "rookies" what awful things
would happen to them when'they got
to the surgeon's tent where the men
were innoculated.
Some Civil war veteran said "that
an army travels on its stomach." We
believe him now and no sight is more
welcome to the boys than head cook
Jones and his able assistants standing
back of the smoking hot provender in
the cook shanty, ready to dole it out
to the hungry men.
The Company has, up until Tuesday
e\eiiing, not been mustered into the
legular army service and as there is
considerable red tape connected with
this procedure, it may take some time
befoie a complete roster of the Com
pany can be made up of the men who
"get by" the regular army medical ex
amination. So far e\erything has
gone on nicely with Company and
predict that in the very near future
Capt. Johnson wTill
be command of
one of the best drilled companies in
camp, and if it eventually comes to a
"show down" with friend Carranza,
the boys will give a good account of
themselves.
Glendorado Boosters Here.
The Glendorado boosters visited us
Tuesday afternoon, with their band,
and did some real boosting for the
Fourth of July celebration to be held
at that place next Tuesday.
There were 56 people in the party,
and 12 automobiles were used to con
vey them. They were completing a
sociability tour, having visited Santia
go, Duelm, Foley, Ronneby, Oak Park,
Foreston, and Milaca, as well as this
place. They reported a cordial recep
tion at each one of the places visited.
The celebration at Glendorado will
be held under the auspices of the Farm
ers' club and the Glendorado brass
band. Both are wide-awake organiza
tions, and the success of the observ
ance is assured.
The program includes an industrial
parade, patriotic music, an oration by
Senator J. D. Sullivan of St. Cloud, a
ball game between Greenbush and
Ronneby, and various races and sports.
Princeton will undoubtedly be well
represented at Glendorado.
