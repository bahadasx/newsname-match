FOUND GUILTY:
TO BE HANGED
Sir Roger Sentenced to Death
Immediately After Being
Convloted of Treason.
JURY OUT LESS THAN HOUR
Irish Peer May Eleot To Be Exe
cuted With Silken Rope for
Part in Revolt.
By WILBUR S. FORREST.
LONDON, June 29, Sir Roger
Casement this afternoon was found
guilty of high treason in connec
tion with the Irish rebellion and his
attempts to induce Irish prisoners
in Germany to desert the British
colors. The jury deliberated less
than an 'hour.
The death sentence was pro
nounced after Casement, in a
scarcely audible voice, had ad
dressed 'the court briefly.
CASEMENT HARD HIT.
Casement' mouth fell wide open
when he heard the word "guilty." He
started, as If to rise to .his feet, fell
back, and flnaly ' succeeded In getting
to his, ft to address the court.
He supported hlmeelt by resting; one
hand on his chair, but his body rocked
violently. His voice quavered so that
his remarks were' barely heard.
The few sentences heard by those
closest to him Indicated that he was
protesting that an English court had
no Jurisdiction over him, since he was
an Irishman.
"What I have to say," he said, his
voice steadying, for the moment, "is In
tended for ray own countrymen."
Partial BaUay.-Ca meht's soldler-cpt-
faderate, who confessed details of the
Irish rebellion i'jJot when he was ar
rested on landing from a German sub
marine, was discharged from custody
Immediately after' Casement was sen
tenced. -
Lord Chief Justice' Reading directed a
verdict of not guilty in the case of
Bailey, who was to nave gone to trial
on a treason chargo Immediately. Bailey
Jrave evidence ror the crown in tne pre
imlnary hearing of Casement.
Hopes Are Gone.
Blr Roger's hopes for acputttal were
dealt a body blow by Lord Chief Jus
tice Baron Reading Just before the case
was given to the Jury.
F. E. Jones, of counsel for the de
fense, who finished summing tip be
Muse of the Illness of Alexander Sulli
van, chief counsel for Casement, ar
gued that Sir Roger was a loyal, pa
triotic Irishman.
He contended that he was recruiting
an Irish regiment among prisoners In
Germany because the Ulsterltes threat
ened civil war In Ireland.
"The Jury." Interposed the lord chief
Justice, "will be Instructed that any act
tending to weaken the country's power
of resistance was 'aiding and comfort
ing the King's enemies.' " .
'It only one of the six overt acts Is
? roved, the defendant Is guilty of
reason," the lord chief Justice In
structed the Jury. "If he knew what
he did would assist the enemy, though
he had another ulterior motive, he Is
guilty."
Casement was plainly depressed by
this ruling. He turned an appealing
lodk toward his counsel, who hastily
concluded his argument.
There Is some speculation as to wheth
er Sir Roger, who Is an Irish knight,
will be permitted to avail himself of the
privilege accorded members of the peer
age to bo hanged by a silken rope.
Verdict No Surprise.
The verdict occasioned no surprise In
the court-room. Blr Roger had offered
only, a weak defense to the oharge that
he gave aid and comfort to England's
enemies.
This was the contention he made In a
personal statement to the Jury that he
was recruiting an Irish regiment among
the prisoners In Germany solely to de
fend Catholic Ireland against the Ul
eterltes. He declared the crown had
failed to establish his connection with
the Irish rebellion.
Witnesses offered by the crown did not
show Blr Roger's direct connection with
the seven days' Dublin rebellion but
they proved conclusively his attempts
to form an Irish brigade among the
prisoners in Germany.
The crown's witnesses revealed, too,
how a Kerry county farmer, en route
to a well to get a pall of water.occldental
ly uncovered Casement's landing from a
German submarine and frustrated tits
plans for heading a revolution'.
Casement's defense consisted solely of
his personal statement to the Jury. No
witnesses were offered In his behalf.
Asquith Denies Rebels
All Granted Amnesty
LONDON. June 29. Premier Asnulth
denied In the House of Commons this
afternoon that the Government had
consented to grant amnesty to nil
Irish rebels participating In the Dub
lin outbreaks, as a condition of set
tlement of the Irish problem.
HI denial was made during the
course of debate begun by Unionist
opponents of Lloyd-George's plan of
settlement.

CAPT. LEWIS S. MOREY,
Of tho Tenth Cavalry, Who Escaped

STILL HAS HOPES
Capt. Morey Believes Men Still
Unaccounted For Escaped
From Battlefield.
culiUM-UUB. June a. aix United
Btates cavalrymen missing since the Car
rizal fight, may. still be wandering In
the Chihuahua desert .-or have perished
from thirst and hunger.
Capt. Lewis S. Morey, hero of the
fight, before leaving early today for
El Paso to be treated for his wounds.
said the six negro troopers still unac
counted for aro believed to have es
caped to the barren hills In the retreat
from the battlefield,
The bodies of Captain Boyd, Lieuten
ant Adair and the dozen or more other
Americans killed outright, were left
lying on the field under the terrific
sun.
What disposition the Mexicans mado
of the bodies of his comrades Morey
did not know.
Retells Story of Fight.
Morey retold the story of the brave
fight the two troops of the Tenth Cav
alry made against overwhelming num
bers, a story the troops at Columbus
camp never will tire of hearing.
Penned In an open plain and nearly
surrounded by Carranzlsta troops, the
American troopers alternately lay down
and fought and rushed the Mexican
lines. Only when their horses had been
stampeded and Captain Boyd and Lieu
tenant Adair had fallen with nearly a
score of others, was retreat begun.
"In the early fighting," saM Morey,
"all about us little spurts ot dirt arose
where the hall of bullets from the Mexi
can machine guns was hitting. Some
dust spurted Into tho mechanlclam of a
trooper's gun at my side. He threw the
weapon away with an oath and used an
automatic. One of our boys near us
curled up. He was hit and died In
stantly. "Mexican cavalry across an Irrigation
ditch were tiding at us, firing from their
horses. It was getting awful hot. Bul
lets were hitting all around.
Getting Their Targets.
"Still, our men were picking their tar
gets and getting them, I was kneeling.
A bullet got me In the shoulder. My
sergeant said: 'We can't stand this
much longer.'
"At last some one of our men got their
machine gun operator. They put an
other man on It. Then Boyd was hit
twice. Adair had been hit already.
Then Boyd said:
. " 'Tell them to go ahead.'
The men Jumped up with yells and ran
right Into the face of the machine gun.
The Mexicans abandoned It and fled Into
the town. I ordered my men to retreat.
Simply had to do It to keep the Mexi
cans from getting behind us."
Morey, weak from loss of blood and
exposure all day on the barcearth In an
excavation, offering no protection from
the boiling sun crept across the desert
at night. Ho foil exhausted under a
mesqult bush and woke up hours after?
ward. Resuming his painful effort to
escape, he halted twenty times In as
many hours.

It is believed that all these organi

Owing to the small number of medi

CARRANZA FRIEND OF U. S.,
ARREDONDO SAYS
Mexican Ambassador Arredondo today announcing receipt
of word from Mexican Foreign Minister Aguilar that the Amer
ican prisoners had been released and should arrive in Juarez
about noon, issued a statement saying this action was to have
been expected.
The statement follows:
I have been confident from the first that the American
soldiers would be released. From tho time of their capture un
til arrangements were made to free them there was at no time
' any other intention on the part of the de facto government or
its military officials.
The attitude of the first chief steadfastly has been oho of
friendship toward the United States, prompted only by a desire
to avoid conflict and promote the welfare of both governments.
In the situation that exists it should be borne in mind that
it has not been brought about by any act which could be at
tributed either to the government or the Mexican people, but
due entirely to the predetermined intention of an irresponsible
criminal.
HAS FllWEfi Tfl SEND

MEXICO 10
Wilson Given Authority by Res
olution Adopted in Senate.
No Aid Given.
Having eliminated all provisions for
the relief of national guardsmen's de
pendents, the Senato today adopted a
resolution empowering the President to
draft militiamen into Federal service.
Senator La Fotletta attempted to delay
action on the resolution until tomorrow
on the ground that Senators favoring
aid to guardsmen should have another
chance to Insert some provision in the
measure.
Insisting on Immediate action. Chair
man Chamberlain said that the release
ot United States prisoners had by no
means done away with the emergencq
on the border. He promised an oppor
tunity to consider aid -for guardsmen In
a separata measure The resolution was
adopted without roll call.
Still Some Hope.
Dependent families of , national
guardsmen called out becausa of the
Mexican Imbroglio still have a chance
for legislation providing for a Gov
ernment contribution to their support
while the heads of the families re
away.
Tho House Is determined to pass a
separate bill providing such support,
following the action that knocked the
provision out of the emergency mllltla
draft resolution.
Chairman Hay. of the Military Af
fairs Committee, said today he would
Introduce the bill and move to suspend
the rules and pass It early next week.
Reconsider Proposal.
Pressure will be brought to have the
Senate reconsider the proposal. The
Senate knocked out the original House
provision as carried In the militia draft
bill and the two houses could not fight
It out In conference because of the
necessity ot passing the draft resolution
without further delay.
Mr. Hay regretfully annouced to the
House that the conferees had been
obliged to eliminate all reference to de
pendent families from tho draft resolu
tion because the disagreement between
tho two houses In conference was In
terfering with the drafting of the mlll
tla. The War Department said Mr.
Hay. wanted qulcq action on the draft
resolution.
"I shall offer as a separate bill the
provision foi a contribution to depend
ent families, and promise the House
I will press It," said Mr. Hay. The .con
ference rtrort on the mllltla draft reso
lution was then adopted by the House
and similar action was to follow in the
Senate.
Deplore Senate Attitude.
Congressmen Madden of Illinois and
Hill ot Connecticut, made brief speeches
deploring the attitude of the Semite.
Mr. Hay said he sympathized with tho
Viewpoint of the House, and that If
the separate bill he will offer does not
become a law responsibility may bo
placed on the Senate.
The conferees." owing to the emerg
ency nature of the draft resolution,
were forced to break their deadlock
and kill both the original House pro
vision and the Srnate substitute re
lating to married guardsmnn. In lieu of
an allowance of not moie than 150 a
month to dependent families, the Sen-
ate suggested that married guardsmen
te excused from duty on their own
nppllcHtlon. This Senate proposal, said
Mr. Hay. placed the guardsman in tho

Adjutant General McCain said that
as soon as the mllltla began mobiliz

Stay at Bisbee Uncertain.
Although It has been announced that
the District troops are going to Bisbee,
Ariz., the War Department officials
believe It would be unsafe to address
letters to Bisbee, as there is no means
of knowing how long the troops would
be stationed there.
Members of the guard will be able to
send their letters to the "folks back
home" without postage, after they have
been mustered Into the Federal service.
Under the postsl regulations, soldiers,
sailors and marines may send letters to
points within the United States and Its
possessions, and have the postage col
lected from the persons to whom the
letters are addressed. I! that will be
necessary will be to have the envelope

The regulation has been In effect a

make It possible for the soldiers to send

places where stamps cannot be pro

EL PASO, Tex., June 29. A
special train from Chihuahua
City, bearing the twenty-four
released American soldiers, la
expected to reach Juarez soon
after noon. The train left the
state capital at 5 o'clock yester
day afternoon.'
Upon arriving at Juarez, the
Americans will be placed abpard
a street car bound for El Paso
without delay and sent across
the Rio Grande.
They wiU be greeted at the
American end of the bridge by
American officers, anxious .to
obtain detailed accounts of what
occurred at Carrizal to supple
ment the incomplete report of
'Captain Morey, already for
warded to the War Department
Following quickly upon news of
the release of the American sol
diers at Chihuahua, members of
the Diplomatic Corps interested in
preserving peace between the
United States and Mexico inform
ed the State Department again to
day of their willingness to lend'
their good offices in bringing about
an amicable understanding.
Among the diplomats who called
on Secretary of State Lansing to
day in this connection were Don
Juan Riano, the Spanish ambassa
dor; Don Ignacio Calderon, the
Bolivian minister; Dr. Alberto
Membreno, the minister from Hon
duras, and Dr. Rafael Zaldivar, the
minister from Salvador.
Only the first two were able to
see him.
CALDERON FIRST.
Minister Calderon, who has been fore
most In the efforts of the Latin-American
representatives to prevent a clash,
waa the first to see Mr. Lansing.
Ho Iqformcd the Secretary that he waa
calling, not to press for mediation, as
he could not pre-suppose that mediation
would now be required or welcomed, but
he desired simply to know the facts ob
presented to the State Department In
It official dispatches from Mexico, and
again remind tho Secretory thit he
Btood ready to proffer his good offices
whenever the occasion may demand.
Secretary Lansing, replying, stated
that until the department receives the
formal reply of the Carranza govern
ment to the demand for tho release of
the prisoners and for a statement as to
Its tuture intentions. It would be Im
possible for him to give any definite In
dication of tho future course of tho
United States.
Thus far, he Informed the minister, all
that tho department has received has
been n telegram from Special Repre
sentative Rodgers In Mexico City, stat
ing that the latter had been advised
verbally by tho Mexican foreign min
ister that the American troopers had
been released.
Must Have Formal Reply.
The secretary made It plain, however,
that the American Government was ex
pecting a formal written reply to Its de.
mands, and was especially desirous to
know Carranza's Intentions for the fu
ture with respect to tho orders Issued
by Ooneral Trevlno to tho Mexican
forces to attack any American detach
ment that attempted to movo south,
east or west.
Ho Indicated, It Is said, that should
this formal reply prove unsot factory,
the United States would then be In po
sition to decide whethei drastic steps
were to be taken, or whether It would
accopt any proffers of mediation.
After Minister Calderon left tho Sec
retary had a long conference with tho
President, who was preparing to leavo
for Philadelphia. Mr. Lansing refused,
however, to make any comments on
the situation. He wll see Minister Zal
divar this afternoon.
Minister Calderon nnd the other
Latln-AmcrlcanI diplomats aro strongly

prisoners, having removed the most
