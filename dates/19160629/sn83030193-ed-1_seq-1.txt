Quick Verdict After Chief Jus

Against the Prisoner.
PROUD HE IS A REBEL
Condemned Man Defiant in
Court, Denounces English
for Convicting Him.
LONDON, Juno ID. round guilty
of the crlmo of high treason nndj
about to bo sentenced to death, Sir
Roger Casement, once brilliant Irish
leader, mado mi Impassioned speech
aa tie stood in tho prisoner's dock be
fore Lord Chief Justice Heading this
afternoon.
"In Enoland alone In the twentieth
century, loyalty to one's country Is
held to be a crime," he said, with a
dramatic nesture. "If it is treason to
fight under such conditions, then I am
proud to be a rebel."
The first announcement of tho ver
dict of "Guilty," made aftor tho Jury
bad deliberated but fifty minutes, un
nerved Casement completely. When
he arose to address tho court his volco
quavered so that t.ls remarks could
6carcoly bo heard.
As he continued ho regained Ills
composure. IIo seemed perfectly
calm as ho protested against condi
tions In Ireland and declared he
tfhould havn beon tried by un Irish
Jury.
Sir Roger addressed tho Court, read
ing his final statement with tho ex
planation that ho wished it might
reach a much larger audience than
the ono boforo him, and particularly
the peoplo of America, from whom
had come- many messages nf t,ym
pathy to him and whoso own struggle
for liberty, ho said, always had been
an Inspiration to Irishmen.
Sir Roger's auditors, among whom
were Viscount Uryco and many other
prominent men and women, listened
In. deepest sllonco, somo moved to
tears.
Tho prisoner declared ho did not re
gard trial by KneMshmon In an
English court as a trial by his pcors,
flo which ho was entitled. Ho ro.
Tlewed recent events In Ireland from
the beginning of tho formation of the
Ulster Volunteers, and wild:
"We have seen the Constitutional
army refute to obey the Constitu
tional Government, and we were told
the first duty of Irishmen was to en
ter that army. If small nations were
to be the first consideration, I saw
no reason why Ireland should shed
any blood for any people but her own.
"If that be treason I am not
ashamed to avow it here. If the
Unionists chose the road they thounht
would lead to the nood side, I knew
my road led to tho dark side. Both
of us proved rinht. So I am prouder
to stand here in a traitor's dock than
to fill the placo of my accusers.
"Self-tiovcrnmont Is our rinht, It Is
no more a thlntl to bo withheld from
us or doled out to us than the riirht
to life or llfiht, to sunshine or sprinq
flowers."
Throwing aside ills manuscript. Blr
Roger said;
"My Lord, I have done. Gentlemen
of tho Jury, 1 wish to thank you for
your verdict. I meant no reflection

A burst of heated language between
Counsel Frank Moss, August Bel
mont, Senator Gcorgo F. Thompson
and James L. Quackrnbush, counsel
for tho Interborough Company, en
livened tho proceeding of tho
Thompson legislative Investigating
committee this afternoon.
The committee was trying to find
out from Mr. Belmont Just what
arguments had been brought to bear
upon Mayor Gaynor to causa him to .
change his attltuJo as to the building
and ownership of tho now subways.
Mr. Belmont, a director of the In-1
terlMirough, was on the witness stand
for the seventh or eighth time since ,
tho Inquiry begun. He said In answer
to Mr. Moss's question that Mayor
Gaynor's change from opposition to
favoring thu Interborotigh "was good
campaign material for any one."
Q. Did you tnke notleo of the sudden

words, at least, are forceful? A. I
gave moro thought to Mr. Guynor than

It was said that on the last ballot
tho Jury stood 9 to 3 against the de

Tho deadlock occurred on tho ques

Benjamin Hlade, her counsel, hailed
the dls.igreitnent as a victory, and

ever be tried again.
Intimations that the Junrs were
considering a compromise verdict
that might exonerate James W. Os

EL PASO, June 29. Twenty-three negro troopers of the Tenth
Cavalry and Lem Splllsbtiry, Mormon scout, captured by the Mexicans at
Carrizal and confined in the Chihuahua Penitentiary, were brought to the
border at noon to-day and turned over to American military authorities.
All the troopers were worn and drawn from their experience and all
were serious save one, who wore a broad smile. This one negro made
himself the impromptu spokesman for his fellows. "We sure are glad
to get back," he said.
The prisoners were dressed in the scantiest and most nondescript
garb. Some had on only trousers. One wore a shirt, while a towel en
circled his waist. Others' heads were covered with bandanas.
Gen, Francisco Gonzales, com-
inunder nt Junrez, and Andres Garcia,
Mexican Consul In Kl Paso, met tho
train when It reached Juarez from
('hlhuuhiln. Tho guard that escorted
tho prisoners, dressed In uniforms of
bright yellow, pushed back the
crowd. Thoy formed a luito through
which Splllbury and tho troopers
marched down tho railway tracks.
They were taken to the disinfecting
plant and there stripped and treated
before bolng escorted to the com
mandancln. Tho trooper refused to discuss the
Carrizal light, their Imprisonment or
tholr icturn to the border.
"We aro soldiers, not plain citizens,"
they said. "We will havo to report to
