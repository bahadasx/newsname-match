An incident worthy of note oc
curred in Bowling Green on Sat
urday night last when the com
pany stationed in that city were
out for their evening drill.
Mr. Charles Heater, an employe
of the Sentinel office, who has had
many years in tho service, and
fho had the honor of being cap
tain of the company, was on
Thursday elected to the office of
major of the regiment. Army reg
ulations require officers to furnish
their own equipment, and through
the efforts of Mr. Franklin P.
Rieglo and Mr. B. C. Harding a
beautiful saddle horse was pur
chased and presented to Major
Heater on Saturday night.
It was a splendid gift and be
stowed upon one who, is in every
respect worthy.
The Bowling Green company left
for Columbus on Tuesday.
A very touching incident oc
curred on Friday night last at Ma
sonic Tcmnle in Toledo when Capt.
Charles Wragge of Company B,
Knights Templars, said farewell
to his men prior to talcing his
place as lieutenant in his company
of the Sixth regiment, which starts
for the front this week. He Avas
presented with a beautiful regula
tion army saber as a token of love
from his company of Knights.
Capt. Wragge had served in the
Cuban war and was entitled to the
privilege of resigning and remain
ing at home with his wife and
daughter, but with Spartan-like
courage his wife encouraged him
to stand by the colors he had long
loved and had supported in pre
vious days of danger, and said
that she would "love him more as
a brave soldier than she would if
he quit at the first sign of dan
ger." THE HONOR ROLL.

shown by her citizens who have
joined the colors, include the fol
lowing names:

In a fast and exciting game
Monroe defeated Perrysburg in
ten innings by the score of II to 1.
It was a hard game to lose, but
in a game such as that played last
Sunday there is credit to both
teams, win or lose.
The visitors scored first. Peter
son,' the first batter up, walked.
On Bernit's attempt to sacrifice
Peterson was out at second. Ber
nit stole second and scored on
Navarre's-hit to center.
Perrysburg tied the score in the
second. Hits by Harper, Pringle
and Noble netted one run. It was
a pitchers' battle up to the tenth.
Monroe got to Eugle's delivery
and drove out three hits, scoring
two runs, and won the game.
The game was well attended,
and with this class of base ball
should swell the crowds.

.Next Sunday the Clark semi

locals. This team is well known,
having defeated Perrysburg two
out of three games, and another
real ball game is assured. Be on
hand and root for the home team.
On July 4th Perrysburg "Will
cross the river and play Maumce.
This game promises to be a hot
contest as Maumce is out for re
venge. Their methods for defeat
ing the home team are not known,
but we need plenty of rooters to
drive the locals to victory.

Cashier R. R. Hartshorn, of the
Citizens' Bank of Perrysburg, is
spending his vacation at the train
ing camp at Plattsburg, New York,
and with others was trying his
nerve on the shooting range, jnd
this is what an exchange says of
him :
. . Ohioan Leads the List.
Lieut. Thomas L. Murray of
Company B, a resident of Marion,
Ohio, stands at the head of the list
with a total of 208 out of a pos
sible 225, with Raymond Hart
shorn, of Perrysburg, Ohio, a
member of Company C, second,
witli a total of 203.
Hartshorn never had a gun in
his hand until he joined the camp,
and his shooting was a surprise
even to the officers of the regular
army, who are accustomed to wit
nessing some strange "stunts"
with the army rifle.
That's some record, all right,
but it should be remembered that
Mr. Hartshorn had some practice
on the bunch of auto bandits who
were captured one night in Per
rysburg a few months ago.
Ray opened on the bunch with a
shotgun and made the auto look
like an old fashioned horseradish
grater, and all four of the men cap
tured were spitting up buckshot
for the next two weeks.
CORN FOR HENS
Largely Used as Peed for Egg
Production.
"In Ohio corn under usual mar
ket conditions is one of the most
economical feeds for laying hens,
and can be well used to a very
large extent in their ration. How
ever, corn must be supplimcuted
with a nitrogenous fced, such as
meat scrap or skimmilk, if good
results are to be obtained from its
use," says W. J. Buss, poultry hus
bandman of the Ohio Experiment
Station, in the June Monthly Bul
letin. Recent experiments at the
station show that hens fed a ration
composed of S7.2 per cent corn
and 12.S meat scrap produced eggs
cheaper than hens given a greater
number of feeds.
Hens given corn, wheat, oats,
bran, middlings, oilmeal and meat
scrap ate more feed, but the in
crease m egg production was not
sufficient to pay for the additional
feed consumed and for the higher
cost per pound of this variety
ration. In one test they produced
8.4 per cent more eggs, but the
feed cost per dozen eggs produced
was 27 per cent more than that
of hens fed only corn and meat
scrap.
A PATRIOTIC FAMILY.
Seven men from one family to
enter the service of the United
States in the prospective war with
Mexico is a record seldom equaled,
but such is the case with Colonel
Wood of Philadelphia, -who with
his four sons and two sons-in-law
have joined the colors. Ono of
tho Colonel's sons recently mar
ried Miss Marcia Robinson, sister
of Mrs. Dr. W. II. Rhcinfrank of

"With the
following article we
shall leave flu.
Thirties" to
themselves. And in describing the
great Meteoric Shower of Novem
ber, 1851U, as it was witnessed hero
in the Valley, it is our intention
to correlate local history with a
spectacular event, so that both
may he the better remembered.
It was during the "Thirties"
that this place had its real begin
ning. Neither before nor since
have we had men and women
more stalwart in manhood or re
fined in character.
Coming from the East, where
refinement and culture had always
been encouraged, they practiced
those virtues in their new western
home and so bequeathed to their
generations a great respect for
learning that is even proving yet
today of inestimable value in
maintaining the social and lit
erary status of this community.
When Joseph Crops arrived
here in 1SIW, there were twenty
three houses and cabins. And
from here to Miltonvillo on the
Maumce there were occasional res
idences all along tho river. The
first above Perrysburg was that of
John T. Key; the second was Mil
ler's; the third was the Crops
cabin; the fourth was the Chad
wick's; the fifth was the red farm
house of Aurora Spafford ; the sixth
was the Williams log house; and
so on up to the old Mission Farm,
near the present site of Volmar's
Park, where Rev. Isaac Van Tas
sel had established on October 27,
1822, a school and mission de
signed for educational and religi
ous purposes. The old Mission
School was up to a few years ago
a relic of an early educational en
deavor in this Valley. In its rooms
white children and Indian urchins
were taught, to read and write,
but how far Van Tassel succeeded
in his endeavor to rapidly revolu
tionize the red race on the Mau
mce, you must read history to as
certain. Returning from the old "Mis
sion Farm" back to Perrysburg,
we find here a little hamlet of a
few houses and stores. Front street
was the only thoroughfare at all
established, and it was only a
tortuous road along the river.
To he sure, the county seat was
here; the old pioneer court house
with the log jail behind it, but
even in "M the town 'was in a very
primitive condition and yet await
ed real organization and incorpor
ation. At this time the stage coach was
in operation between hero and
Lower Sandusky, and was the
only means of travel in a public
way other than by sailing vessels
over Lake Erie and up the river.
Many interesting stories of "stage
coach days"" are told by early set
tlers. The stage, with its proud
driver, was a daily arrival at the
'Burg. Generally four spirited
hordes were driven; passengers
crowded in and on top of the coach
anywhere to ride and away
they would go, ripetty-lick, for tho
next stop, which was usually a
country tavern or small "settle
ment." Thus people came and
went. During tho "Thirties" tho
red man, his squaw and string of
papoos.es was still an inhabitant of
tho region about. Tho squaw car
ried her papoose strapped to a
board with basswood bark when
she traveled. This board, or slab,
sho stood up against tho corner of

FRANKLIN P. RIEGLE
Wood County Should Name the Next Congressman for the Thir
teenth District.
Many years have gone by since
Wood county was represented in
Congress by one of her own citi
zens, and now that we are in a dis
trict wherein Lucas county is not
a part, the possibility of placing a
Wood county man in Congress
should appeal to every citizen of
the county, regardless of political
affiliation or personal feeling.
Republicans are especially in
terested in this respect in the fact
that Wood county has but one can
didate for Congressman and that
the contest has settled down to
WOOD COUNTY UNITED
against all the other counties in
the district.
Wood county CAN win.
Wood county MUST win.
Wood county easts the largest
Republican vote of any county in
the district, and by giving it solid
ly to the Wood county candidate,
ho is sure to bo nominated.
Every candidate for a county
office on the Republican ticket is
vitally interested in tho nomina

inatcd his influence in bringing

greatly assist in the election of the

A Congressional candidate "who
has an extensive acquaintance and
is a good campaigner, is a strong
help for the county ticket in his
home county, and with Mr. Riegle
on the ticket the Republican coun
ty ticket will receive a boost that
will make itself felt for each and

Republican candidates for county,
offices are not favorable to a
