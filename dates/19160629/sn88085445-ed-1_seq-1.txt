SINGING KAFFIR BOYS UNIQUE NOVELTY
Balmer Brings Boys From Kaffir Land In South Africa to Chautauqua
DON'T think the hlark boys in this picture represent a group of cannibals, even though they may be dressed quite warlike. These boys are the mem
bers of Palmer's Kaffir Boy Choir, which .1. H. Balmer has brought to America direct from South Africa. It is probably one of the most unique or
ganizations e\er brought to the west and will undoubtedly cause EDUcfc comment when the boys give their concert at the Chautauqua. Each of
the hoys [ins-esses a remarkable voice, and. although they cannot talk the English language, they sing English songs and sing them so they are un
derstood Palmer spent many years among the tribes of Kaffirs and Hottentots of South Africa and says they are the most remarkable people of the world,
these bnys are graceful and m:m!y and are as perfect physically as a human being could be. The Kaffirs are unusually Intelligent and are anxious to learn
the ways of the white people. The Kaffir choir program is one of unusual interest, and whoe\er spends that evening at Chautauqua will carry away with
him a new conception of Africa and its possibilities.
