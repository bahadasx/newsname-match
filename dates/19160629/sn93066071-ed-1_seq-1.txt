SIONER, SECOND DISTRICT.
Tiik HeiiAt.D takes great pleasure In
announcing tho name of A. M. Uurnam
for thii Democratic nomination for the
olllqo of County Commissioner from
the Second District.
.Mr. DuriiMil was bom in lRT In Ma
con county, Missouri, and lived on a
farm thorn until about twelve years
ago, when he came to I'eaver County
He I! lei". 01. a e'sim eight miles south
east of this city, and cultivated the
tame for some time. He took up the
auctioneering business eight yean ago
and was unusually successful from the
beginning of his elforts in that line.
Hluce that time he has cried hundreds
of sales and has not had n single dis.
satjgfled natron, as far as we can learn.
For the past four or live years he has
also been engaged In buying broom
corn, grain, etc., and has been quite
successful along that line, although he
has not amassed anything like a mill
ion dollars.
From th very beginning ot his life
iioi'e he has been among tho leading
boosters for Heaver county. On many
occasion he has proven his sincerity
and love for his homo county by con
tributing liberally, in money and in
work toward anything that was for Its
unbuilding. The people who have been
associated with him .know of these
thing!', many of which have not been
made.Vublie, and he Is recognized as a
live, energetic limitless man.
Mr. Hurnam, as will be seen from
the above, his nad a wide and varied
career, and in not a single instance has
he met with failure Through this ex
perience he has learned many thingB
that lit him for the position he seeks.
It requires a man of good buxinesB
sense and judgment to (ill the office of
County Commissioner, and Mr, Iiur
nam measures up to these require
ments fully. We believe that, ehould
OF INTEREST TO ALL.
All economical buyers will find some
thing of Interest in Fctnherg's ad. this
week. Tho Kelnberg stores have an
enviable reputation each establish
ment throughout Its trade territory.
Five years ago M. Felnberif opened
the famous "Golden Kegle" store at
Wichita. The business )ecamd Imme
diately bo popular a place that he was
Induced to open a store at Medicine
Lodge, Kansas, about three yearn ago
Later he opened a similar store In Lib
eral, Kansas, well known throughout
that fction as the "Daylight Store."
It occupies one nf the most modern
buildings In Liberal, and Is fitted with
elegant fixtures, plate glass at both
back and front, and is the 'popular
trading center of that city.
The store at this place was opened
for business April 27th, 1010. During
the short space of time intervening It
has leaped into popularity at almost
one bound under the able management
of Mr. Cooper, The-local Btore Is not
eU fitted up as fully as It will bo In
the near future. Several hundred
dollars worth or absolutely new fu
tures are to be Installed, and tho stock
is already as complete and up-to-date
as one can find In the large cities.
Deaver is always glad to welcome
Euch meretorious enterprises, and has
shown its good will by patronizing tho
store liberally.
