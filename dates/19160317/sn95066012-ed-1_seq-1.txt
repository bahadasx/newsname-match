CLASH IN REICHSTAG POSSIBLE
Dispatches Indicate Emperor Opposed
Drastic Plans of Minister In
Undersea Warfare.
Washington, March IT. Emperor
William's determination not to pro
voke a break with the United States
in the new submarine campaign, even
, though It Involves a factional contest
in the German Reichstag, having al
ready brought about the downfall of
Grand Admiral von Tirpltz himself, is
' indicated In yesterday's Berlin dis
patches, said a dispatch from Wash
ington yesterday. The tone of these
dispatches from the German capital,
although guarded and veiled, is taken
at Washington to prove the supre
macy of the emperor. Chancellor von
Bethmann-Hollweg, Foreign Minister
von Jagow and the army, which has
. been opposing the plan of Admiral von
Tirpltz and the navy party to carry
the submarine campaign to a merciless
destruction of all neutral shipping to
enemy ports.
About a fortnight ago it is under
stood a conference was held in Ber
lin presided over by the emperor him
self and attended among others by
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg,
Herr von agow and Gen. von Falken
hayn, chief of staff, and it is believed
that Admiral von Tirpltz himself was
called in. The decision turned on
submarine warfare generally and par
ticularly upon the attitude of the
tTnlted States. .
Subsequent events in the American
CongTess were forecast with remark
able accuracy. The general under
standing was that it was the emperor
, himself who decided that every effort
should be made to retain the friend
ship of the United States short of
abandoning any principles Involving
the honor of the German nation.' -.
The result was the rejection of the
proposed extension of submarine war
fare to affect neutral nations. Van
Tirpita's retirement follows naturally
the rejection of the plans he had
: ' lathered. It is ' realized ' in Washing
' ton that Berlin is now to witness a
! conflict between the emperor and. a
' powerful element in the Reichstag,
wrought up to a high pitch of in
dignation over the condemnation ' of
the Von Tirpltz plans.

Passengers and Crew of Tubantia
Were All Saved
MINE OR U-BOAT RESPONSIBLE
Wireless Calls Brought Assistance in
Time to Save Lives of All on
Board.
London, March 16. The Holland
Lloyd passenger steamship Tubantia
sank early today off the Noord Hinder
lightship as the result of striking a
mine or an attack by a submarine.
Several American passengers are said
to have been aboard. The eighty or
ninety passengers and crew of 800 are
believed to have been saved. '
The Tubantia, 15,000 tons, left Am
sterdam Wednesday for the river
Platte and was to have stopped at
Falmouth for passengers and freight.
Early this morning wireless distress
calls from the ship were heard at tho
Hook of Holland and torpedo boats
and other craft rushed to its as
sistance. Some of these boats reached the
steamship before it sank and took off
passengers and members of the crew
while others picked up survivors from
the Bblp's boats.
Tho first flashes from the Uttct said
it had been torpedoed and was sinking
near the Noord Hinder lightship.
Later messages attributed the disaster
to a mine. Until full details of the
sinking are at hand it will be impos
sible to say definitely what caused the
sinking.
Among the Americans said to have
been on board the Tubantia was Rich
ard Schilling, described as an Ameri
can consul and his wife and daughter.
Seventy survivors were taken Into
Flushing, Holland, by two torpedo
boats. - Others took rrfuge on' board
the lightship while still others were
picked up by Dutch and SWedish ves
sels. Those arriving at Flushing said
tha exjtloaion oecurred. at 2.30 o'clock
this. morning, just as the Tubantia was
about to drop anchor. Opinions among
them- varied as to. whether the vessel
had struck' a miae or had been, tor
pedoedby a submarine, i '
i ..Tho Tubantia was built In Glasgow
In 1913 and was 640 feet long and sixty-five

ST. PATRICK'S DAY.
Eight Below Zero Ushers in Birthday
of Irish Patron Saint.
"St Patrick's Day In the Morning"
was eight below zero in Bennington
this year. The shamrock's green
Btood out against a white background
of high-piled snow, a touch of contrast
being inserted in the color scheme in
the way of red cheeks due to a frosty
wind which blew in the faces of pe
destrians. The Irish people were loyal in the
wearing of the green, and following
the custom, many who are not Irish
but who respect the sturdy qualities
of the folks from the Emerald Isle,
wore the shamrock or the miniature
IriBh flag as a tribute of friendship to
them. The sale of novelties and sou
venirs was heavy and green neck-ties
were a popular color. - '
Special mass was celebrated In the
Catholic churches in the early morn
ing, but as St. Patricks day is more a
feast day and holiday the real cotn
memoratory services are joyous ones
and this evening will be given over to
parties, dances and a minstrel enter
tainment in St. Francis de : Sales
Academy hall.

A "DOG--GONE NUISANCE
Too Many Ownerless Bow-wow T Run
; . nlng the Streets of Village. ;
; At half-past ten Wednesday morning
twelve dogs, more or less worthless
from the blue-blooded standpoint, dis
ported themselves merrily in Putnam
Square to the nuisance of pedestrians
and peril of traffic. They ranged all
the way from the species suggesting
cockroaches with hair on, to the
Champ-Clark variety, but one thing
they had in common that was, pos
session of the square. They got In
the way of automobiles and ran bark
ing in front of horses. Once they all
started "en masse" for a sidewalk and
nearly shoved over In their rush a
womau with two children, at which
both of the kids were scared into noar
hysterics and began to bawl like a
pair of little Apaches.
The thing might be considered a
joke were it not for the ugly tenden
cies displayed by some of these ani
mals in their excitement o getting
together for a high old time on the
public domain, most of them are ab
solutely worthless and without collars
or license tags.
The dog problem is not a new one to
Bennington. The loss of over 60 sheep
within three months by fanners about
Bennington this fall makes the free
dom of these animals not only a nuis
ance, but a costly item to the village
and town. It has been estimated that
there is now around $6000 in the town
dog fund, received from licenses, but
this does not warrant droves of the an
imals running fast and loose in the vil
lage proper.
This Js not so much a condition for
the attention of the police as it is for
the dogs' owners. Their dogs are al
lowed to run wild, in many cases going
without identification collars or tags.
And some of these animals are abso
lutely vicious.

One of the Strongest and Safest
Institutions in the State
SLOW PROGRESS IN EARLY YEARS
Dr. F. S. Pratt Elected Trustee to Fill
Vacancy Caused by Death of
E. L. Sibley. ,
Dr. F. S. Pratt has been elected by
the trustees of the Bennington County
savings hank to fill the vacancy caused
by the death of Edward L. Sibley.
Dr. Pratt has been on the board of
corporators J"or many yeara and has
always been greatly interested in the
progress and prosperity of the bank.
The present board of trustees is
composed of I. K. Gibson, president,
J. R. Judson, vice president, and John
Robinson, Edward D. Welling, Daniel
F. Gardner, Harrison I. Norton and
Fred S. Pratt. Charles H. Dewey Is
treasurer and Richard F. Rawson as
sistant. .The savings bank runs along so
smoothly from year to year that many
people do not realize that the Benning
ton County savings bank is probably
the strongest and safest savings bank
la Vermont.
Some folks think without due con
sideration that the bank with the
most money is the strongest, but In
fact big deposits are sometimes an
element of weakness unless the re
serve is correspondingly large.
The strength and safety of a bank
depend chiefly on its management
and on the proportion of the surplus
and reserves to the liabilities. The
Bennington County savings bank had
on Jan. 1. 1916 deposits of $2,622,263.86
and in surplus and reserve funds it
had 1277.617.11 or more than ten per
cent of its total deposits. The ex
penses of the bank too are lower in
proportion to business done than al
most any other bank in Vermont.
These several good points make the
bank- probably the strongest and saf
est savings institution in Vermont.j

years took the bank to 1888 when! its
total of deposits v.; and ! surplus ' was

today. The growth by Ave year

1903 1,000,658

On Jan. 1, 1916 the total of deposits,
surplus, and other resources was
$2,899t785.97 and it seems certain that
the bank will pass the three million
mark within a year.
For several years the bank has paid
four per cent interest on deposits and
at the same time has steadily added
to t,he surplus. It Is a strictly .co
operative bank of the 614 fashioned
sort, having no stock, and. the earn
iugs all go to the depositors and the

the dog noticed another team traveling

Bennington people have a right to
keep dogs,' but a dog Bhould be made
to behave himself as well as his owner '
and when their numbers increase so i
that they becamo a general nuisance, j
those owners should place them
promptly under restraint. Those dogs '
who are continually running the bus

and there are a large number of store-'

them, who would vote a grim resolu

We mention with sorrow the death
in the mid-summer ot Miss Josephine
Keeler, who for nearly two years as
chief assistant in the Library and for
two years more as Librarian fulfilled
in an exceptional manner the duties
of her position and was most highly
regarded by all the patrons of the
Library. Elsewhere has been record
ed In particular reference this loss sus
tained by the Library and the com
munity. Succeeding Miss Keeler, Miss
Esther Merrill of Bennir.ton very ac
ceptably acted as librarian for several
months. After careful searching the
Board of Managers called permanently
to the position Miss Mary A. Patch, a
graduate of the Springfield, (Mass.,)
Library School, who with several
years' experience came to us directly
from the State House Library, Boston.
We invite suecial attention to her ac

I assumed my duties as Librarian

There are 7585 volumes now In the
Library, not Including about 400 bound
government publications. During the
year, 326 new volumes have been
added, 261 by purchase and 65 by
gift.
353 new borrowers have registered
during the year, in addition to many
temporary cards issued in the sum
mer for the use of non-residents.'
A comparison of the circulation rec
ords for the years 1915 and 1916 show
that there has not been any , increase,
althought it has been nearly equal to
that of the preceding year. This Is
due in part to weather conditions;: an
unusual amount of illness; and to the
fact that the Library has been closed
on more days this year, and on one
more evening in each week. :One en
couraging fact in the circulation de
crease is that the decrease was among
the fiction readers. ' while there was
an Increase of 1045 in the issue of
adult non-fiction. A great many books
are read in the reading room, no
record of which is kept. The largest
circulation per month was 4921, in
July; the smallest 2521, in September.
