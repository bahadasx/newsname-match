according to Douglas, Ariz., advices.
Italds of Mexicans on American
towns along the border have been
numerous during the lust few years,
but none of them has equaled the
massacre at Columbus, N. M , In scopo
or daring.
The town of Columbus, N. Méx., is
partly in ruins and at least sixteen
United States citizens are dead, fol
lowing a murderous raid over the
border early Thursday morning by
Pancho Villa at the head of 1,000 of
his Mexican bandits. The Mexicans
paid dearly for their raid, Pablo
Lopez, Villa's chief lieutenant, was
killed and scores of the outlaws fell
under tbo fire ot the United States
soldiers and citizens.

Thursday night Secretary Lansing
inlornied the de facto government of
Mexico, through Kllseo Arredondo, its
auibassador designate here, that he
trusted no objection would b; made
to tho fiction of the American troop.-),
they having followed what is known
In military circles as a "hot trail."

news of Villa's outrage was quickly
succeeded by undisguised satisfaction
in official and congressional circles
over the knowledge thai niter three
years of patient forhcaiance I'nited
Stall's troops actually were on Mexl
can soil to avenpe the death ot their
ccmrades and bring to justice the out
laws for their depredations.
Yi'hile no formal word of the policy
ot the administration was given out.
It was reliably stated that th-i army
would he given free rein to catch tho
Lr.ndlts if possible.
It was not considered in nd minis
tint Ion circles that Col. Slocum's uct
in any sense constituted an Invasion
td Mexico, a policy which the iidmin
intrution has opposed in the past and
will continue to oppose.
Formally, there is no authority for
the presence of the Amerlwn troops
in Mexico, in fact, the patrols along

determined. The War Department,
"for military reasons.'' has requeste-I
that estimates ot the number of
tioops to be usel be withheld from
publication. The general plan will
be to distribute the infantry to guard
the bolder towns, while the cavalry
will be released for scouring the
mountains, deserts, sage brush and
arroyos, lu order not to weaken tho
defense of border towns it may be
necessary lo move oilier tioops from
