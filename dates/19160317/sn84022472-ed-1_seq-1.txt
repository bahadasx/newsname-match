Washington, - March 1 17 Represen
totive E. yj. 'Hill's committed expend
ed . more money in ,the Fourth Con
gressional District,, in the 1914 cam
paign, than the Democratic state cen
tral committee expended in the entire
state of Connecticut. Such is the
sharp accusation made in - the final
brief filed -today by Homer S Curo
rrfings, for former Representative
Donovan, in his contest to unseat Mr.

The brief concludes with a striking
summary of the claims of Mr. Dono
van, as follows: ,
'"Xiet, us oqt lose sight of the
most conspicuous question involv
. ed " in this contest. Mr. Hill
sought to evade existing law by -'
establishing, between himself and --v
the law, a committee which, un
' der his guidance and : with his
' full knowledge, consent and ap-'
' prbval, " and, jyrith.. his active afeid
persistent co-operation, collected
,' and expended to pro'ncte his elec
ition the sum of about $10,000. If
Mr. Hill had, not : been. 'he. can

such committee. There had never ;
' been such a committee in this

of MV. Hill's orain.

GUARDS HARBOR
OF BRIDGEPORT
Mystery in Presence And
Contraband Shipping JIs
Hinted At Here. .
The TJ. S. Burroughs, a fleet torpedo
boat destroyer, capable of steaming .eft
netarly 30 knots per -hourN-lies off
Bridgeiiort. Her presence heie at this
time is a matter of keen speculation
among shipping men "for it Is known
that she is one of a fleet of r torpedo
boat destroyers that have guarded
New York against violations of neu
trality. ' i 4
Heretofore the Burroutrhs h.ts been
stationed off Fort Hamilton, N-aw Tork
city, but on Wednesday orders' were
said to' have been ceived by -wireless
which sent her quickly u the coast
and. into the Sound.
Tkat an attempt was made at ship
ping munitions of war against United
States' regulations, from the ports, of
Bridgeport seems improbable at this
time as no ocean-going boats of the
typ heretofore used i& running con
traband ' to. Cuba during the Spanish
insurrection have been noted near this
port; - . , s
JVom the crew of a, 30-foot motor
sailer which made the venturesome,
passage acros the Bound from the
anchorage ground of the Burroughs,
it was learned that the destination Of
the destroyer is not known, although
word was passed among the crew that
torpedo practice might be ordered
while here.
That Mich a course . will be pursued
seems questionable in circles familiar
with navy customs, for the waters are
extremely rough and great difficulty
would be experienced in "finding" fired
torpedoes., which are of great value af
this time. The Burroughs, however.
veiled by the distance, guards the port
today .and is capable of overtaking
nearly any craft that might attempt
to run the gaintlet. against govern
ment regulations. '
I Incidentally the feat of an open 35-
foot power boat in crossing the Sound
yesterday in the face of winter weath
er Is one that has opened the eyes of
local sniping enthusiasts to the dar

While working at a severe tenement
house fire, at Helen street and Berk

Horkheimer's right leg slipped into a
mudhole and his knee was renched.
He was incapacitated, but recovered
after a long convalescence, enough to
report' for duty. At the Farist Steel
works fire the same knee was hurt
when a falling' timber stuck it. The
injuries-Are of a permanent nature.
Three are after the position, but so
far it is nip and tuck, according to the
dope. ;- Captains George Wilson of
Steamer No. , C. W. Holden of No. 1
Chemical, and Thomas Burns of
Steamer No. 4, all have a chance.
From a source close to the adminis
trati'on of the fire department, it is
learned that Maurice Reily, driver of
Hose Company No. 5, has been picked
for the lieutenancy at Nov 1 Engine

long and was much sought after.

more than seven times as much as
' the Republican-committee in the
first congressional, district, ex

"Mr. Hill's committee disburs

Hill, to spe,nd. ( '
' "If such conduct was permissi

there has been successfully intro
duced into our political life a new
and corrupting influence of appal

' "The issue in this case Ts far
more important than the personal
: or, political fortunes of either Mr.
Hill or Mr.' Donovan.. It is a,
' question with which all good citi

Trumbull Murderer Qff at
Noon To Serve Life Sen
tence in Wethersfield.
After an effecting parting with his
two soils, Jason, jr., and Willie Haines,
who were brought from Trumbull to
day by their guardians for the pur
pose - of bifling the convicted mur
derer farewell before -he begins a life
sentence in the Connecticut - state
prison, Jason S. Haines left for Weth
ersfield today on the 12:18 train.
He was handcuffed to a deputy
sheriff and also to three other prison
ers .who will spend from six to 12
years in the penitentiary. The pris
oners were Ernest Ruff an, Theodore
Hayes and George Faber. High Sheriff
Simeon E. Pease took personal super
vision of. the trip, acting as a special
guard to the fhree other, deputies, and
accompanied the .party. .
During the night Haines was kept
apart from the other prisoners and a
jailer was commanded to watch over
his every action. Haines slept. Though
at .first somewhat unnerved by the
verdict- which he had been led to hope
by the long disagreement of the jury
might be manslaughter with the
chance of his being paroled from an
insane asylum upon bonds, he later
seemed to become reconciled to his
fate.
At the Galen hospital Juryman
James Toohey, of .563 Warren street,
Bridgeport, who collapsed- yesterday
after the ordeal, was reported - in a
serious condition due to several long
standing maladies. S

Jason, Jr., and Willie Haines were
taken1 into their father's presence
shortly afterlO o'clock this morning.
They were embraced . by their father
and the few parting words of each
brought tears to the eyes of the en
tire party. The affection displayed
between father and sons seems recip
rocal. The smallest boy,' Willie, was
greatly overcome.

EMPLOYES STOP WORK
Refuse to Keep Jobs While
Faint-Hearted Ones Are
In Their Room.
The strength of the clamps that
bind the parties in the, agreement
made between the Warner Bros. Co.,
and the union girl workers.in the fac
tory, followmg the strike last summer,
became apparent today when five -girls
who wouldn't quit work yesterday
with the other . girls, were discharg
ed. .. i
Another strike was threatened this
morning when the 45 laundry depart
ment workers, who quit Wednesday
and returned to work yesterday, after,
a setTement.
They found ' that seven girls who
hadn't quit with them, even though
they were union members, were still
at work. "The whole room stopped
work, ' and then the committee called
Superintendent John Field. ,
The powerful , arguments of the
committee convinced the superinten
dent that something had to be done.
He made an offer to shift four of the
girls to some other" department This
wasn't accepted. The girls insisted
all had to go. After a conference
with D. H. Warner, Mr. Field attempt
ed to place the seven girls in other
departments. The workers in the
other rooms wouldn't work with
them. ' - .
After operations had been lield up
from 7:30 o'clock to 9:30 o'clock, the
matter was settled by the discharge
of five, girls, the quitting of one and
the transfer of another. Work was
resumed at 10 o'clock.
BOSSES BALK
AT THOROUGH
UNIONIZATION
Master -Builders Informally
Decide to Offer Comprom
ise Settlement to Bridge
port Union Men Who
Want All Work With
Which They Are Identi
fied to Bear the Label.
The labor situation in Bridgeport
was complicated today when it be
came generally known throughout
building circles that a - disagreement
is likely between the Bridgeport Local
Assembly Interstate Builders' Con
tractors & Dealers' association and the
Building Trades council.
The council recently sent a com
munication to the Interstate associa
tion strenuously urging increased
wages for the carpenter masons and
other tradesmen who work pn the
ejection of any building,, and the
thorough unionizing of every "job."
On a structure where union plumbers
were employed, for nstance, they
urged that the carpenters, painters
and masons all be union men.
The Interstate association, it has
become . known, is not disposed to
grant these conditions. A com
promise will be offered.
An informal meeting of the Inter
state contractors was held Saturday
evening and the matter was discuss
ed. - The sentiment . was that they
should not consider the recognition of
the union clause,, but that they should
meet the men half way on the other
propositions.
The contractors are disposed to
grant the wage demands, in part. They
think the requests too stiff. While in
formation concerning the plans was
refused by the officers of the Inter
state association today, it has tran
spired that they feel sure of their
ground.
A meeting will be held next week at
which action .will be taken. It is ex
pected that ii will be. pojnted out that
the masonry workers' agreement with
the contractors, in which the masons
promise to work with non-union men
i necessary, precludes any thorough
recognition of the union. N-
It is expected ) that the contractors
will make the contention also, that
most, of the big carpentry employers
run open shops and will not consent to
establishing closed shops.
The same contention - will be made
in regard to the plumbers. The open
shep phase will be dwelt upon.

who arrived here today from Monterey.
The news was suppressed by the Garranza authorities be

MILLIONAIRESS'
SUIT IS SETTLED
OUTSIDIl COURTS
Publicity Found Unpleasant
For Carstairs and Fergu
son Families.
In order to avoid further " publicity
in the affairs of the millionaire Car-
stairs family of Philadelphia and the
equally wealthy; Ferguson family of
Stamford, the alimony suit brought by
Emilie Carstairs Ferguson against
Walton Ferguson, Jr., has been settled
out of court. The case has been on
the superior court triali list for over a
month buf counsel for Ferguson ad
mitted this morning that the suit
would not go to trial. He refused to
state what the terms of settlement
were.
This suit resulted from the divorce
which Ferguson obtained after a sen
sational trial in 1911. He claimed, his
wife had become, infatuated .with a
half Breed guide employed at the Fer
guson summer camp in Maine. as
part of the divorce agreement Fergu
son agreed to pay his wife $300 a
month alimony. She charged the pay
ments were not made and brought the
present action for $2,000 damages.
In their cross-complaint counsel for
Ferguson said the reason the alimony
was not paid -waslecause Mrs. Fer
guson had taken her daughter Frances
out of the state and refused to allow
the child to visit her father as agreed.
Ferguson claimed his wife poisoned
the child's mind against him so that
she threatened to run away -and kill
herself. The child also wrote a letter
to her father expressing loath'ng and
hatred of him.
Because Abercrombie & Fitch, tlii
New York sporting equipment firm,
bad brought suit against Mrs. Fergu
son, " she assigned her claim against
Ferguson to her mother, Mary White
Carstairs of Philadelphia. Mrs. Car
stairs died last October and her exec
utors, Daniel H., J. Haseltine, and
James Carstairs, Jr., of Philadelphia,
were named as p'aintiffs in the suit.

American troops in pursuit of Villa

The censorships surrounding the

not a single despatch from the Ameri

byj the war department since the an
nouncement of WednesQay night that

A' long code message frm General
Funston came to the department late
last night but Secretary Baker declar
ed it contained po news of importance
and would not make it public.
Unofficial advices from the border
said that Villa and his njen are far to
the south of the American force. Army
officials believe that it. probably will
take several . days for the American
pursuers,' aided by -the Carranza sol
diers, to cross the desert and overtake

Night marches will probably be
made by General John J. Persh
ing's expeditionary forces in
search for Francisco Villa, it
was indicated today at Fort
Sam Houston. Night marches,
it was pointed out, would lietp
to puzzle Villa as to the move
ments of the American, columns
and would keep the men and
horses fresher. Days could be
used for reconnoitering. Des- ,
patches today stated that G. D. '
Williams, American . consul :
who quit Torreon when trouble
with Villa broke out, is on his
way here from Laredo, where
he ar rived yesterday. It was
said he had fiot been asked io
make any report to army offi
cials. Reported Activities

Is YetUnconfirmed
El Paso, March 17. Beports that
American troops under co"-"-"ti3 "
Brig. General John J. Pershing ha
been fired upon by snipers as they
continued their hunt ' for Francisco
Villa - remained unconfirmed today.
Such an incident, however, would not
be considered here 'as indicating that
the American -army's march into Mex
ico up to date was regarded otherwise
than as a peaceful expedition so far
as the majority of the Mexican people
are concerned.
A few definite facts facts about the
American expedition today stood out
with considerable clearness as the re
sult of official published reports and!
the news brought here by Americans
who have been in touch with some
i
portion of - the American movement.
It seemed certain that or the. two
columns wlch;' .. are . .."somewxieTe " in
Mexico," one was Constituted for speed
while the other apparently was mov
ing more slowly. , The swift-footed col
umn was the . auxiliary army, seem
ingly most cavalry, which went into
Mexico 50 miles west of the main army
of General Pershing, when his forces
crossed at Columbus, N. M. .
The secrecy which has surrounded
the movements :of . the main , column
has been slight compared with the
record of this western force. There Is
reason to believe, from the official an
nouncements, that the western column
may have gone into" Mexico earlier
than the main body. Every report ar
r'ving here asserts that the western,
wing has traveled the farthest. By
these same reports the two columns
will form a junction near the threat
ened ,Mormon eolonjetsypossibly in the
Casas Grandesregion. ' - :. . ,
It is estimated here that the cost of
the Vilal pursuit at present is upward
of $40,000 a day.
Water was running through the irri
gation ditches' back of the Juarez
racetrack and thereby was explained
a "sensational report" widely ' published
that the .Juarez garrison was digging
military trenches. .
From he racetrack brown clad men
were seen - who seemed . -to be digging
in the ditches and the trench story
ppead. J They were workmen cleaning
rubbish out' of " irrigation ditches so
that the water might -enter.
Daniel Hurst, son of Bishop P. ' H.
Hurst, of the Mormon' churcH, who
reached here yesterday from the Mor
mon . cololies with important news
about Villa for the American army,
considered his chances of getting
through -safely so uncertain that he
made part of his trip in hiding be
neath some cover arranged by the
trai conductor under one of tjie
