LOCAL HIGH AND BEMIDJI HIGH
WILL CLASH ON ST. CLOUD
FLOOR
Excitement is ruuning high here as
the time for the final game to decide
the highsehocl basketball champion
ship of the Sixth district draws near,
anil from all indications the attend
ance at the game tomorrow night be
tween Little Falls and Bemidji will
break all records. Jhe game will be
played on the St. Cloud floor, where
both teams will have an equal chance.
A large number of local fans will
make the trip. Jt is possible that ar
rangements can be made so that the
game will not be held until the arriv
al of No. 14 at St. Cloud as many will
no doubt want to go down for the
game on that train.
The showing taat the local boys
made in their game with Brainerd last
Tuesday evening was so remarkable
that Coach Liljedahl is confident they
will win, but nevertheless he will not
allow this confidence to make any dif
ference in the playing of the boys,
unless to have them play better.
If Little Falls wins this game, as
it hopes to do, it will go to Northfield
for the state championship tourna
ment, in an attempt to land the state
trophy. The tournament will be held
there next week.

VOL. 28 NO. 2 LITTLE FALLS, MORRISON COUNTY, MINNESOTA
N. P. REPORTED TO BE PLANNING
ON INCREASING YARD TRACK
AGE HERE
At no great distant future the east
railroad yards of the Northern Paci
fic Railway company, which have been
practically unused since the passenger
station was moved to the West side,
will be pressed into service, it is learn

For some time the West side yards
have been inadequate and the traffic
there has been very congested, caus
ing a delay in moving freight. By
putting in several side tracks on the
east side this trouble will be greatly
relieved. This will mean that from
fifteen to twenty freight trains will
be tied up in the east vards each day.
The change will not affect the pas
senger trains, it is understood.

DONAHUE, ANTI-LYNCH, WINS
DISTRICT—SCHILPLIN OR GAL
ERNEAULT OTHER SELECTION
The first presidential primary hold
in Minnesota took place Tuesday, and
in the cities, a rather small vote was
cast. In the country, however, it was
town election day, and a much larger
proportionate vote was turned in. In
Little Falls about a forty per cent
vote was cast.
The democratic vote in the county
suffered badly as such staunch demo
cratic towns as Pierz, Buckman, Buh,
Agram and Hillman mainly voted the
republican ticket. This same condi
tion obtained in Stearns county and
throughout the state.
In the county and state the repub
lican voters gave Cummins a big lead.
The delegates in the le%d are Eber
hart, Van Sant, Manahan and Stevens.
In this district Hanscom and undecid
ed between Scow and Allbright.
All delegates on the democratic tick
et ran under the Wilson banner. For
delegates at large Lawler is away in
the lead in the state with the rest of
the candidates apparently bunched,
and it looks as though those selected
will be split on the Lynch matter.
Several of the anti-Lynch district del
egates have been successful and Dona
hue of this district seems to have a
strong enough lead to be considered
safe. The fight for the other dele
gateship is between Schilplin and Gal
erneault, Lynch adherents.
Donahue and Baer carried the city,
and Donahue the county, the vote for
Schilplin and Baer being close. Reiter
and Wessel, anti-Lynch lead in the
city, and also in the county, as a
whole. There are still a few precincts
missing.
The following is the totals obtain
able for this county at the time of go
ing to press on republican and demo
cratic candidates from the Sixth dis
trict:

car repair shops of the N. P. on the
West side, while attending to duties
Monday had a narrow escape from in

found its way into the pipe with the
tobacco. He had previously placed
the cartridge in his pocket and it had
found its way into his tobacco pouch.

ditorium, the Choral club having de
finitely decided to give it on that date.
The concert will begin at 3:30 p. m.

ebunt of the inability of several of
those who were on the program to

al fine selections and in addition to
this there will be solos by several lo
cal people and one or two musical num
bers. Mrs. H. Reinhard of St. Cloud
will be the only outside soloist on the
program. She has a fine soprano
voice, according to those who have
heard her, and her numbers promise to
'be a pleasing addition to the program.
On account of the fact that there is
some expense connected with giving
the concert, a contribution box will
ibe placed in the hallway leading to
the auditorium, where contributions
can be left, after the concert.. This
will be absolutely a free will offering
and no one should miss the concert be
cause they cannot or do not wish to
contribute. Everyone, young and old,
is wanted to attend the concert. The
complete program will be published
next week.
At the Choral club practice Monday
evening it was also decided to give a
concert some time during the latter
part of April, at which Mr. Gould of
Chicago, "baritone, would be the solo
ist. He will give a concert at St. Cloud
before coming here. An admission
price of 35 cents will -be charged for
this concert.

at a special election next Thursday.

ery voter should exercise his privilege
in casting a ballot.

Northwestern. Canada is no place to

with food, etc., according to Henry
Otto, formerly of this city and until

from International Falls, were strand
ed on the prairies in the Peace River
country for over six weeks. They
were going there to open a store in a
township which was recently platted.
They set out fol a settlement in the
Peace River valley and were traveling
£1953 country a bad bliszarji Set
in, forcing them to camp jn the snow.
They had only two horses and a- lim
ited supply of provisions. One of the
horses froze to death and they had to
kill the
otheT
for food, as their sup­
plies were giving out. They finally
made their way to IJie settlement but
were in a half-starved condition when
they got there.
Mr. Otto is know to many local peo
ple as he lived here for a number of
years, previous to moving to Interna
tional Falls. He was employed in the
