Washington, March 16. Secretary
of War Uuker officially announced ,
that the American expedition in pur-'
cult of Francisco Villa, the Mexican '
bandit chief, has crossed the border. '
Previous to the announcement tho
secretary carried to tho White Houte
and laid before President Wilson an
official dispatch from General Fun

Upturning to tho war department,
ho Issued this statoment: "The de
partment received a message from i
General Funston which announces
that American troops crossed the bor-
der into Mexico. I am very happy to
nay that tho dispatch shows that tho
military representatives of the do I
facto imvcHiment of Mexico not only
laterposed no obstaclo, hut appear to
be co-operating."
Tho impression in war department
circles iu that Uio main columns
crossed at, or about, Columbus, N,' M.
which Villa attacked last week, and
was undor tho personal command of
Colonel Dodd, commander of tho Sec
ond cavalry brigade, and that other
columns entered from a point cast of j

through Ascension leads directly to eral Pershing. The troops crossed the

Dispatches from tho border stated
tiiat Villa had burned a Mormon lanc'a
at Colonia Bublan Tuesday night and
that tho Mormons in the vicinity were

havo idvlsod the department that ho
probably will divide his forces Into

Tho Initial expedition is understood
hero to consist of from 5,000 to 8,000
troops, mostly cavalry and mountain

from ueuting back towards tho border
end committing further depredations
on tho American side, and also in or

treachery from the Carranzislas, Gen
eral Funston has disposed upwards of
1G.0OO troops along the border.
Elaborate provisions have been
made to Ueop General Pershing's
forces supplied with provisions and
ammunition, nnd, owing to tho scarci
ty of water in the region to ho cov
ered, special automobile trucks are
bring nif.hed to tho border to lcccp
tht expedition supplied.
To what extent the Carranza forces
"appear to be co-operating" was not
rllF.alosed by Secretary Baker.
Indicative of the fa"t that the gov
ernment Is taking no chances of meet
ing unexpected opposition from the
Carranza followers was the conflrma
Hon of reports that the customs of-
l'.cials ilmp the border are holding up
Jiymitions of all kinds reaching there
for shipment across the line.
The Mevlcan embassy denied that
the Carmnza authorities made any
request of the United States that the
Funston expedition be delayed 'or two
weeks In order that the Carranza
forces in northern Mexico might cap
ture Villa unaided.

Soma observers of Mexican affairs

long, hard task. Much of the north

Paris, March 16. The offensive in
tie battle for Verdun appears from
the official statements to have passed
Into the hands of the French. Counter
attacks made against tha positions
taken by the Germans on the Belhln-court-Cumieres
front recaptured cer
tain of these trenches. The heights
of Le Mort Homme did not chango
bands; they are still in possession of
the French.
It Is in the region to the cast of the
Meuse that the French seem to bo
taking the offensive. Violent activity
ic reported from tho Vaux-Damloup
front, where French' skirmishing par
ties armed with hand grenades forced
the fighting on tho slopes to the east
Of the Vaux fort.
Whlli? the French were reoccupylng
part of the lost positions on the west
bank of the river and assuming the
lead in tho fighting on the east bank,
the Germans made no Infantry at
tacks, and even their artlHery bom
bardment, which had been of 'reat
violence on the Bethincourt-Cumeriea
front, decreased appreciably In in
tensity. No attempt has been made
by the Germans to make furt'ner prog-
i ress to tho west of the river since
Tuesday, and thi3 assault, which was
preceded by so great artillery prep
aration, now appears to be over. The
positions gained by the Germans
Tuesday, part of which have been re
occupied, were in the region of Hill
265, immediately northwest ot tho
height known as Le Mort Homme.
The artillery activity on the right
bank of the Meuse and in tho Woevre
has become intermittent.
In their advance against the Turks
along the Black sea littoral toward
Treblzond the Russians claim to "nave
captured additional Turkish officers
end men and two machine guns. A
British column has attacked an ad
anced position of the Turks In Meso
potamia, bayonetted a considerable
rumber of the Turks and captured
others.
In the Austrc-Itallan zone the Ital
ians are vigorously shelling Austrian
I'csltlons and here and there throw
ing their infantry into the fray. No
marked changes in the line have oc
curred, however.

bridge on the St. Louts, Brownsville
and Mexican railroad, about fourteen
miles north of Brownsville, last night.
At least 100 shots were exchanged.
None of the Americans was injured.
Monterey, Mexico, March 16. So
firmly do tho masses of the Mesicon
people believe that armed interven
tion on the part of the United States
in the affars of this couuUy has ac
tually occurred that an upheaval ot
resistance of tbe Invasion, is threat
ened to occur at any moment. When
it comes the massacre of most of the
comparatively few Americans remain
ing in Mexico and the destruction of
much. American owned property- is be
lieved to be inevitable.
The assurance of the Washington
government that the expedition Is
purely punitive in its nature means
nothing to the average Mexican; tha
mere fact that American soldiers are
i n Mexican soil is sufficient to arouse
to white heat his latent hatred for the
race that took from his people Texas
trd wiat now comprises a rich part
of the southwest and west.
Many Mexicans of the higher class,,
who know the temper or the Indian
clement of this country when aroused
tc fury, prefer to risk their lives in
the United States rafi.er than in their -
f.wn land in this time of crisis. Hun
dreds of them have crossed tho Rio
(Srande into Texas during tho last
few days in order to be out of danger
when the period of rioting seta in
here and elsewhere.
Throughout Mexico, notwithstand
ing the fact that many people ot the
better native element expressed them
selves as being hopeful that the ntry
ot United Status troops will solve tha
troubles t.f Mexico, they say that arm
ed opposition to thi3 Invading force
is certain to occur.
Mexico City reports state that Za
pata and Felix Diaz are sending sol
diers from southern Mexico to Villa's
