WASHINGTON,
HAY OPENS DEBATE
ON PREPAREDNESS;
ISSUE UP IN MI
Congress Responds to Wilson's
Appeal for Instant Action
on Defense.
CONSCRIPTION IS OPPOSED
Congress today responded to tho
country's demand and President Wil
son's appeal for Instant action on pre
paredness. Both Senate and House plunged Into
national defense legislation. All other
considerations were submerged; neur
ly all other business halted.
To rush the passing of the prepared
noes program, the house began actual
consideration of the army reorgani
sation plan. In the Senate the army
bill was also formally launched. Both
houses hurried toward results, spur
red by the American expedition Into
Mexico,
Preparedness for peace, not war, was
the keynote of the debate In the House.
Sentiment against conscription and com
pulsory military service also was al
marked feature of the discussion.
Hay Opens Debate.
Thrills and excitement of usual strug
gles In Congress were notably absent.
Chairman Hay, of the Military Corn
trittee. opened the debate In the Houso
as spokesman for the Administration.

rush consideration.
Gordon of Ohio advocated adoption of
a military training system similar tu
the Swiss. He supported the bill In
general.
"National detente Is being discussed
by many who know little about It."
said Gordon. "Those that know the
least talk the most. The greatest
danger to liberty is a large standing
army; and the best substitute Is an
adequate mllltla.
Chairman Hay mode a letalled ex
planaUon of tho Administration legisla
tion. "On a question of this character all
Americans should stand together," Hay
declared, bringing applause from both
sides. He praised the non-partisan way
In which the bill was drafted.
He called It a "reasonable" measure.
Expect Opposition.
"It will meet with opposition from
those opposed to any defense and those
who think we have not gone far
enough," said Hay. "We have a volun
teer system In this country, and we
have to deal with conditions as they
aro and not as In other countries where
they have a compulsory system.
"To have an army of 200,000 men
would mean compulsory service. I do
not think the country would accept
this." . ..

pressed sentiment against conscrlp-
"A narmy of 250,000 would cost
1700,000,000 a year,' he continued. "I
do not believe Congross Is ready to
saddle this expense, on the country In
time of peace.1'
With auxiliaries and Insular forces,
Hay said, the bill really provides for
16S.MM men.
Ho was Interrupted frequently by
qvcstlons about details, no said -'Maw
men could be added tol the proposed
army of 140,00ft in case of war. tho army
being thus quickly expanded by using
the proposed skeleton peace organlra

all times In tho United States about
60,000 men. Tho others will be In our
possessions," snid Hay. "At no time
have we had 100,000 men In teh army
since the Spanish war."
Hay said he would tntroduco an
amendment giving the President the
right to draft In tlmo of war all men
between teh ages of eighteen and
forty-five years.

name, dispatches from both Paris and
ueriin agree today. Tho slaughter on
tne northern ridge, where Bllaslan
troops gained a footing, has not been
equaled since the desperate lighting
around lVtuaumont and Vaux.
Reports Contradictory.
Paris and Berlin reports today eon
tltitie flatly contradictory In the ac
counts of the struggo for Dead Man
Hill, the bulwark of tho French lines
west of the Mouse. The French war
omce, nfter first denying tho Berlin
claim that Slleslans hod captured the
position, reports the repulso of rresu
Gorman assaults against thn plateau,
and announces that the Germans havo
been driven off to the north.
Tho Berlin statement, somewhat
vogue, reports that French attempts to
reconquer Dead Man Hill and positions
to the north, have beon repulsed.
British mtlltaiy experts, accepting the
Fiench claim us true, declare that,
had tho French lost thu position, tney
must of necessity have abandoned the
village of Uothincouit, to the nortn
west. Berlin has made no claim to
itethlncourt's capture, and the latest
French official statement reported the
village still llrmly held by the French.
From Dead Man Hill French Buna

to the Mouse, blocking any advance

Attacks Continue.
Ileay Artillery ftro along this whole
sector yesterday has convinced military
critics that tho Sllcslan regiments have
not abandoned their attempt to take
the plateau. Unless the hrencn are
driven from tho hill by frontal attacks
