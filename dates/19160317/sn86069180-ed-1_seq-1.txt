REPLY TO NEW YORK TRIBUNE
The New York Tribune attacked
tse Irish race convention held In
Now York, calling tho Irish and
Irish-Americans who comprised the
delegates "Ireland's betrayers,"
laying it were a better policy for
Irishmen to still go to tho front
and fight John Bull's battles for the
sako of the shallow promises of
homo rulo that England still holds
out. Tho Tribune editorial drew
tho following scorching letter from
Brendan J. Murphy, of Now York
City, and give3 sane and logical
reasons why tho Irish people and
fholr descendants can expect noth
ing from England. Tho card is as
follows:
A reading of your editorial on
tho above subjects suggests certain
comments which you may seo fit to
print, even though they do not coin
cide with your viows. Mr. Red
mond's loudly expressed desiro for
wholehearted Irish participation in
tho war was undoubtedly based on
a lino of reasoning similar to your
own. It may be supposed to have
run thus: Whatever the outcome of
the war, England Is likely to bo
left in tho end In. continued control
t tho sea in a position to dictate
Ireland's future, as sho has con
trolled her past. Hcnco tho prudent
and statesmanlike course Is to sup
port England regardless of the is
iucs involved, so that sho may have
no excuse for rescinding tho .very
slendor modicum of self-government
which tho aborted home rulo bill
contained.
As a matter of diplomacy this
left littlo to bo desired, but when it
came down to Individual-cases It did
not work. Would you havo ap
proved the Belgians, after conquest,
joining tho Gorman army against
tho Allies in order to invoko tho
nlemency of tho victor when the
final settlement should come?
Should tho Alsatians havo followed
a like course? Germany has lately
been talking of giving them an
utinomy scarcely less complete
than Ireland's. Is it in human flesh
and blood to fight in tho armies of
foreign nation which all your
folk-lore, your literature and your
history teach you to have been your
country's chief and solo oppressor?
Can centuries of racial hatred be
obliterated by a mere promise (sub
equently withheld) of a seanty
measure of tardy Justice?
You refer to tho small enlist
ment figures. I hopo sincerely that
they are true. They show that In
tho decimated and Impoverished
peoplo who still Inhabit Ireland tho
old fires of patriotism burn, and
that if they havo been driven to
beggary they can not bo bought bv
bribery or terrorized by threat.
Your figures do not show what per
centage of tho Ulster levies have
been drawn upon. Even as late is
last November I read in a Belfast
paper, which shows its colors by
printing lte hea'dllno in orange, tho
admission that thero had been un
expected delays in getting tho Or
angemen to tho front duo, as was
explained, to lack of equipment.
But the Munsters and the Dubllns
and tho Corks found no such dif
ficulty in getting to Galllpoll. Was
it wonderful that tho Impression
grow that loyal Orango enlistment
was based on a gentlemen's agree
ment that they would constitute the
homo guard? Consider for a mo
ment how this would havo affected
tho post-bellum situation. Had tho
Nationalist Irish enlisted and gone
to tho front and been given the
post of honor, which they nearly
always got, thero would havo been
far fower to contest tho issuo with
tho loyal Orango homo guard after
tho war. If a Liberal British Gov
ernment boforo tho war could bo
bluffed by Carson out of doing an
net of partial restitution, what po
sition would a Unionist Government
tako after tho war? Better for
Irishmen, if they must lose their
lives, to loso them; for Ireland, and
in Ireland, than as the victims of
blundering British butchery.
In all tho long relations of tho
two countries England has done
nothing for Ireland from a sense of
Justice. Tho same motives that
nnn v.n,. to nffor the -apology
for homo rulo which sho calls a
homo rulo bill, win do openmvo
after tho war and will be more ef
fective tho moro living Irishmen
i n tx (itntcf itnnn them.
If the men who aro urging Irish
men to stay out of tho war aro
her betrayers, tnen u nm

ENTHUSIASTIC MEETING.
Tho meeting of Division 4, A. 0.

thusiastic one, possibly becauso of
tho near approach of tho St. Pat-
W J CONNELLY,

rick's day celebration, and then
again possibly becauso of the splen
did attendance. County President
V,. J. Connelly was presont and es
pecially urged tho members to at
tend the G:30 o'clock mass next
Sunday morning at St. (Patrick's
church and recolvo holy communion,
calling attention to tho fact that
thoro were no conflicting dates to
deter anyone from attending this
year. Lawrence J. Mackoy, Presi
dent of Division 3, was presont and
was given a warm wolcomo. He
spoke of tho interest taken in tho
St. Patrick's day celebration by his
division and made ono telling point
In which lie said that any Irishman
or Irish-American that did not be
long to tho A. O. II., tho representa
tive Irish society, was not a true
descendant of tho race. President
John Hennossy then called on John
J. Sullivan, whom, ho designated as
ono of tlie old "war horses" in the
rankB of tho order, and tho latter
responded that ho would over be
loyal to tho grand old order. James
McTIghe, T. J. Langan and John J.

INGRATITUDE TO LOUISTILLE
Tho adjournment of the Ltgisla
turo early Wednesday morning left
no acning void in the hearts of the
people of Kentucky, the one word
descrlptivo of tho actions of that
body being hypocrisy, and this can
bo applied to both the Democratic
and Republican members, who" de
layed every measure for tho good
of tho people in the interest of pro
hibition, both parties havinc reDre-
sontatlves who betrayed the wishes
or tneir political parties.
It was expressly stated in the
platforms of both contending Dar-
tles last year that they stood for
the county unit law, this being the
roremost plank In both plntforma,
tho result in tho primaries further
verifying that tho people as a whole
hoped that tho lecislatlvo sessions
this year would not, as In tho past,
bo burdened with fanatical legisla
tion, fostered by political Drcach-
ers and prohibitionist lobbyists who
dorive big revenuo from tho Anti
Saloon League. To the disappoint
ment of ovorjone, the General As
sembly had hardly convened before
tho same dilatory tactics wore intro
duced by the prdhibltionists, who
opposed every measuro for the good
of Kentucky if the supporters
wouldn't bargain for tho support of
the dry legislators, who voted as a
unit In nearly every Instance. From
first to last the Prohibitionist legis
lators, led by a Baptist minister,
waged a fight to betray the wishes
of the people, who had declared for
county unit, the result being a con
tinual turmoil, featured by many
disgraceful charges.
Tho Kentucky Irish American has
contended and still contends that all
of this could have been avoided if
tho administration leaders had
taken a firm stand against the pass
ago"oreven -the-intTmluction'of pro
hibition legislation Into the affairs
of both bodies. It was demonstrated
conclusively at different times that
tho administration, probably
through thetpiomisc of political pat
ronage, could swing enough of the
so-called dry element Into line and
on the last day managed to even
keep a prohibition measure In the
hands of tho commltteo by a de
cisive vote, although at an earlier
date the same body voted largely la
behalf of a prohibition measure.
Thus it shows that tho administra
tion disregarded tho platform of the
Democratic party when considered
necessary, and this latter fact docs
not sit well with tho people who
wero responsible for tho success of
last year's ticket. A striking in
stance is shown in tho passage of
tho Hutchcraft bill. Though this
measuro was bitterly opposed by
tho men who led tho fight for pro
hibition, nevertheless the adminis
tration whipped Into line as many
of tho diy .votes as was needed to
carry this measure in both houses.
This samo effort mado at tho outset
could have stifled and discouraged
tho flood of prohibition measures
that featured tho sessions in both
houses.
That it is tho intention to punish
Louisville Democracy Is shown by
the announced progiammo of some
of the present State Democratic
leaders. First, tho Stato convention
Is to bo called in Lexington, instead
of Louisville, as nt first intended,
and tho delegates to tho Democratic
national convention, If there are
four, will bo chosen as follows:
Gov. Stanley, ex-Gov. McCrcary,
Senator James and Senator Beck
ham. This despito the fact that
Louisville and Jefferson county was
responsible for tho election of Beck
ham in 1014, and last year giving
the Stato ticket a majority of over
4,000, when tho voto out in the
rest of tho Stato was against the
Democratic ticket to tho tnno of
about 3,700. Gratltudo, If nothing
else, should prompt tho present
leaders to select ono of tho four
delegates from Louisville, and a
fitting reward would bo tho ehoos
Ing of Mayor Buschemeyor, Col.
Frank McGrath or Col. James P.
Whallen. Tho Cincinnati Enquirer
correspondent, who Is closo to the
powers that bo, further announces
that If thero aro eight chosen, with
a half vote each, Justus Goebel,
ex-Senator Camden, Congressman
Cantrlll, and last cholco Swagar
Sherloy. For eight straight years
tho Dornocratlc organization in this
district has won signal victories for
the city. State and national ticket,
yet this Is to bo tho reward. Verily
gratitude is a vlrtuo lacking In the
maekup of tho present leaders of
Kentucky Democracy.
