To Join I'nited States Troops.
Several hundred Mexican troops,
commanded hy Lieut. Col. Dato Camp
hell, are reported to have passed
through Pulpito pass into Chihuahua,
and were expected to rive active sup
port to the United States soldiers.
Colonel Campbell, who is CaJles's chief
lieutenant, is a resident of Douglas.
Persons living he: e say that he ha
heen one of the most active Sonora
officials in advancing American senti
ment among the Mexican troops and
civilians in Sonora.
Kntrenchments were being dug to
day by the forces of Calles held in
reserve at Cabullona, a short distance
south of Agua Prieta, but officials
here of the de facto government ex
plained that this was to "keep the men
occupied and prevent dissatisfaction."
Americans Fleeing.
El Paso, March IT. Rapidly grow
ing uneasiness among Americans
throughout Mexico, especially in the
north and west, was evidenced today
by reports from various sections that
I'nited States citizens were either on
their way to the border or were pre
paring to leave. At practically every
point of entry along the northern and
northwestern frontier Americans
arrived today from the Interior.
Jn the majority of instances
they were leaving Mexico as
a matter of precaution and not be
cause of any over acts of hostility
against them. The most significant
report was received from Durango,
where the American vice-consul ad
vised that his wife and child be sent
out of the count ry. This followed
closely on the arrival last night on
the border of the American consul
from Ton-eon with a large number of
Americans.
Don't Want to Talk.
Americans brought numerous dis
quieting stories about the attitude of
the Mxicans in the interior especially
in Chihuahua. Durango and Coahuila.
but invariably they told these stories
privately and when asked to make a
statement for publication insisted that
everything was quiet in the sectior.
from which they came. They ex
plained they expected to return to
Mexico when things became more set
tled and they did not wish to say any
thing which might arouse the resent
ment of the Mexicans.
An American who arrived today
from the city of Chihuahua reported
all was quiet there yesterday. The
Mexican consulate here received a tel
egram from General Callcs, military
governor of Sonora, saying a Villa
spy K. Pauobilos. had been arrested
at Dos Cabezas. It is alleged this
man was in Columbus on the night of
the raid. He said Villa had fled after
the raid to Corralltoe, where he mur
dered several cowboys and seized a
number of horses. He then started
for Galeana by way of Prerto Choco.
SEND A WARSHIP
Battleship Kentucky Dispatched to
Mexican Port.
New Orleans. March 17. The bat
tleship Kentucky sailed from here
shortly after 10 o'clock today for Vera
Cruz, where she was ordered by the
navy department yesterday. Capt. D.
K. Dismuks said the warship carried
her full complement of officers, blue
Jackets and marines.
Some doubt was expressed in snip
ping circles whether the Kentucky
would be able to get through South
west Pass without delay as mud lumps
h&VS formed there owing to the h
water in the Mississippi, causing some
obstruction of the channel.
Reports from t he Pas? said there
was about 2 7 feet of water in the
channel. The Kentucky draws 24 feet.
Ft. Sam Houston
Poet Writes The
First War Song
San Antonio, Texas. March 1 7.
Soldiers of Fort Sam Houston have a
new war song. It is sung to the tune
of 'Tm On My Way to Mandalay" and
the chorus of it is as follows:
"I've got to go
To Mexico
For Fighting Freddie says its so;
I've got to fight
With all my might
So the stars and stripes may hlow ;
Look out. Villa, for I wouldn't be yer
when us boys see yer.
That's way
I've pot to go
To Mexico.
I'm going to say pood-bye."
The song was composed by a poet
in the engineers.
TO MARCH NIGHTS
Pershing Relieves Troop Moves
Can Re Concealed.
AH C. S. Regiments Left Mili
tary Bands Behind.
San Antonio. Texas, March 17,
Night marches probably will be made
by General John J. Pershing's expedi
tionary forces in their search for
Francisco Villa, it was indicated at
port Sam Houston today. Night
marches would help to mystify Villa
as to the movements of the American
columns and would be easy of accom
plishment, it is said, because there is
sufficient tight for the purpose. Also,
they would keep the men and horses
fresher. Days could be used for re
connoitering. Daylight marches make it impossi
ble to hide troop movements. Huge
clouds of dust indicate the marchers'
progress and are visible at great dis
tances. Don't March to Music.
There will be no music for the sol
diers of either General Pershing's or
Colonel Dodd's commands to enioy.
f while on the march or in camp, it has
become known. Not a single regi
mental band has been taken with the
expedition. This is because it was de
sired not to handicap the expedition
with any useless appendages, not be
cause the absence of martial music
was expected to aid m secrecy regard
ing troops movement.
Word was received today that C. A.
Williams. American consul, who qui
Torreon when trouble with Villa broke
out. is on his way here from ixredo.
where he arrived yesterday. At the
army post nothing was known of Wil
liams's coming. It was said he had
not been asked tc make any report to
army official.
A FLYING SQUAD
Believe Dodd's Men Crossed
Before Pershing Bid.
Constituted for Speed Two to
Meet in Casas Grandes.
Kl Paso. March 1 7. Reports that
American troops under command of
Brigadier General John J. Pershing
had been fired upon by snipers as they
continued their hunt for Francisco
Villa, remained unconfirmed today.
Sniping and even the possible killing
or wounding of a few American sol
diers by these long-ranged marksmen
was not regarded here as an indica
tion the American army's march into
Mexico up to date was otherwise than
! a peaceful expedition so far as the ma
i jority of the Mexicans are concerned.
A few definite facts about the Amer
ican expedition today stood out with
i considerable clearness as the result of
official published reports and the
news brought here by Americans who
have been in touch with some portion
of the American movement.
Started 50 Miles Apart.
It seemed certain that of the two
j columns which are "somewhere in
Mexico," one was constituted for
j speed while the other apparently was
j moving more slowly. The swift-foot-I
ed column was the auxiliary army,
seemingly mostly cavalry, which went
into Mexico fifty miles west of the
I main army of General Pershing when
his forces crossed at Columbus, N. M.
The secrecy which has surrounded
; the movement of the main column has
been slight compared with the record
i of this western force led by Colonel
Dodd. There is reason to believe,
from the official announcements, that
! the western column may have gone
j into Mexico earlier than the main
i body. Every report arriving here as
i serts the western wing has traveled
' the farther. By these same reports
; the two columns will form a junction
near the threatened American Mor
I mon colonists, possibly in the Casas
'Grandes region.

London. March 1 7. The German
drive at the Verdun defenses has
again shifted its direction. Strong as
saults were made by the Germans on
the lines east of Verdun during the
night. Five successive assaults in the
Vaux region were repulsed by the
French, Paris announces today.
The German attacks were of the
most violent character, but each was
broken up by the French curtain of
fire, the Paris war office declares.
Both the fort and the village of Vaux
were objectives of the Germans.
Launched Mass Attacks.
The heavy fighting in the past few
days has been to the northwest of the
fortress, and only last night Paris re
ported massed attacks by the Ger
mans, who drove at the French posi
tion at Dead Man's hill, only to be
forced back eastward toward the Cor
beaux woods, suffering heavy losses.
Although a bombardment has been
continued in this region, the infantry
attacks have not been renewed.
Important operations may be devel
oping along the southern part of the
Russian front, as Vienna reports in
creasing activity by the artillery on
both sides. In Galicia the Russians
have attacked along the Stripa but
without success, the Austrian war of

HOLIDAY WHEN i
TOPEKA TROOPS
GO TO MEXICO
Immense Demonstration for the
March of Battery A.
Unfurl Flags and Banners at
Call of the Bugle.
EVERYTHING PACKED, READY
Materials and Equipment Can j
Be Handed Out Quickly.
Sons of Veterans Will Be in
Charge of Display.
Topeka will display her patriotism ;
and declare a holiday when Kansas j
troops are called to the Mexican bor
der. That is the plan agitated today
by members of the Topeka order of 1
the Sons of Veterans. Their program
calls for a demonstration for Battery ;
A., and it is probable that the plan
for a patriotic display will be made
state wide.
No word came to Topeka today
from the war department in Washing- !
ton. Failure to receive orders, how
ever, did not delay the work in the :
offices of Charles I. Martin, adjutant
general, and materials and equipment
of the state troops are packed and
ready for immediate response. Kansas
will answer at once any call from the
federal government, officers of the na
tional guard declared.
As soon as the call for Kansas
troops is received from Washington,
public announcement will be made.
John W. Fisher of the Sons of Vet
erans today urged that Topekans dec
orate their homes and office buildings
with national colors. Under the plan
advanced by old soldiers and sons of
veterans, thousands of flags will proo
ably be displayed in Topeka, whistles
will be blown and a real demonstraj
tion will mark the calling of the Kan
sas troops.
Would lake to Go Uinxself.
"I wish I were ST) years younger
that I might go too," sadly remarked
Fisher today. "But you can bet I
will do my best to show Battery A.,
that 1 am with them. I think all Tqr
peka feels the same. The same spirit
is in every section of the state and
the demonstration ought to be state
wide." p
Notice will be sent to Kansas towns
as soon as the call is received. Patri
otic demonstrations wrill be made in
many of the towns where companies
of the national guard are enlisted.
When Memorial Hall was dedicated,
more than 1 ,500 4x7 feet Americans
flags were distributed among To
pekans. Veterans in Topeka want the
flags unfurled in tribute to state
troops as soon as the call is issued.
The plan will be urged today among
business and professional men. Gov
ernor Capper wnl 1 be asked to u rge
officially a demonstration. The plan
calls for the decoration of hundreds of
homes and business houses in Topeka-
General Charles I. Martin, who has
been in Washington for a week, will
probably return to Topeka Saturday or
Sunday. In event a call for the na
tional guard should be issued in his
absence- officials in charge of the of
fice are ready for immediate response.
TEN HOUR DEBATE

Aight Sessions to Follow Presi

Washington, March 17. The army
1 increase bill was up for consideration
in the house with indications of its
passage before tomorrow night. It
is part of the administration's national
defense program and was prepared by
the house military committee. The
house had paved the way for consid
eration of the bill by the adoption of
I a special rule under which ten hours
of general debate will be allowed after
I which it will come to a vote on its
! passage.
House leaders were prepared to
; press for prompt action although a
; vote may not be reached before next
j week, because five minute speeches
probably will be made under the
i standing rule after general debate is
concluded. Night sessions will be
. held.
A special rule was brought in the
t house and passed in a hurry after
1 President Wilson had urged the lead-
ers to speed up action on the defense
program. The army bill as given trie
; right of way over the immigration bill
which will be taken up next for con-
sideration.
While the house was debating this
, bill senate leaders were taking action
i for prompt consideration of the

Peace Tribunal
Is Costing Ford
$10,000 a Week
Stockholm, March 17. Henry
Ford's permanent peace tribunal
in session here will get in Sweden
all the heip Sweden can give. This
aid will not be official but un
doubtedly it will come from cer
tain official as well as unofficial
sources. The Swedes being pro
German and convinced Germany
wants peace, would like to see the
Ford movement succeed, though
the best informed Swedes do not
believe it has any chance.
Incidentally. " Stockholm is
friendly to the tribunal because
it is spending approximately $10,
000 weekly there. Except that
they have delegates present who
are well paid and supported in
handsome style, Norway and
Denmark regard the tribunal with
strong disfavor. The Dutch are
afraid the movement may do ac
tual harm. Switzerland and
Spain have never been heard
from.

DEMAND MORE TAX
Imperial Chancellor Outlines
War Finances.
Germany Has Year's Deficit of
480 Million Marks.
Berlin. March 17. Dr. Karl Helf
ferich, secretary of the imperial treas
ury, introduced in the Reichstag yes
terday the budget proposals and bills
for new war taxes. Dr. Helfferich in
sisted upon the necessity of rigid econ
omy in framing the budget, saying::
"We shall put on the brakes wher
ever we can."
Dr. Helfferich said it was essential
to make adequate provisions for war
requirements in the way of loans.
"This is not red tape," he said. "It
is nothing but duty and foresight for
a coming day."
Peace to Germany Advantage.
The secretary pointed out that an
increase in revenue by taxation was
necessary, although he said every
German expected peace would bring
j financial advantage. After stating
that war expenses were not included in
the budget, he referred to the fact that
the influence of the war was notice-
jable in the increase on the interest on
the public debt, which was 1,268.000
marks last year and is now 2.303,000.
000 marks. He sai d the budget
showed a deficit of 480.000.000 marks,
which was to be covered by the war
taxes.
Dr. Helfferich said new taxes should
be avoided as long as the regular bud
get, together with requirements for
providing for the public debt, bal
anced without them. The secretary
also replied to criticisms that he had
shown a lack of originality in devising
new taxes, declared he cared more for
money than for originality. Dr. Helf
ferich urged the reichstag to expedite
the financial legislation saying that
the new taxes would provide 10,000.
000 marks each week for carrying on
j the war.
Banks Loaded With Coin.
The secretary said F rance up to the
present had not even raised 10,000.000
j marks in war loans, and that Kngland
(had raised between 18,000.000,000 and
19,000,000,000 marks of which 15.000,
000,000 was in the form of a short
j term floating debt. Germany, he said,
had raised 25,000,000,000 marks and
all the loans had consolidated. At
the same time the cost of the war in
January and Februarv fell below 2,
000,000,000 marks. German savings
banks the secretary continued now
have deposits of SOO.OO.ijOO.OOO marks
: in excess of 1914 in addition to which
4,500,000,000 marks have been wiUi
j drawn from the banks for war loan
j investments Germany's enemies, Dr.
, Helfferich asserted, are carrying on a
campaign of defamation which ex-
tends into this country where paid
agents spread rumors for the purpose
I of impairing the success of war loans.
Points Patriotic Duty.
' The secretary' reminded the reich
j staer of the battle now in progress at
Verdun saying:
"Our troops have the right to ex
; pect that we at home prove worthy
I of them and also every" one shall con
tribute as he is able in the effort to
bring about victory and peace."

Kl Paso, March 17. Carrafiza of
ficials, it was learned today, have been
: discussing with some concern whether
i American troops during the Villa pur
i suit would have to occupy any Mex-
ican cities and the effect of such oc
! cu pa tion upon Mexican public sen'i
: ment. The Carranza officers have
I frankly expressed the hope that the
i garrisoning of the cities can be left to
! their own troops. The American
army's choice of the Chihuahua desert
t as its place of entry precludes for the
i present such a problem as city garri
' son duty. It is estimated here that
! the cost of the Villa pursuit at present
is upward of $40,000 per day.
Only Ditch Diggers.
Water was running today in the ir
rigation ditches bacl. of the Juan z
race track and thereby was ex
plained a sensational report widely
published early this week that t he
Juarez garrison was digging military
trenches.
Sunday Americans at the races saw
brown clad men who seemed to be
digging ditches and the trench story
spread. They were workmen cleaning
rubbish out of irrigation ditches so
that the water might enter.
Daniel Hurst, son of Bishop P. H.
Hurst of the Morman church, who
reached here yesterday from the Mc
mon colonies with important news
about Villa for the America n a rmy,
considered his chances of szettint:

made part of his trip in hiding be
neath some cover arranged by the
train conductor under one of the
coach seats. Hurst left Casas Grandes

of a carload of serenades and
artillery ammunition in the
yards of the National Railroad
lines at Monterey, Mexico, last
Tuesday according to passengers
reaching here today from Mon
terey. The news was suppressed
by the Carranza authorities be
cause of the tensioiT existing be

Mexico.
Several were injured. All the deftd
and injured were Mexicans. Imme
diately after the exclusion a moun
tainous cloud of smoke spread over
the city and the cry'. "The American
have arrived," ran throughout th
poorer section. When The smoke
cleared away it was found that besides
the 24 dead, a hundred yards of rail
road track had been torn up, window
panes shattered and other minor dam
age done for a radius of a half mile.
The disaster, if caused oy the care
lessness of any smoker anions th

main a mystery, as everybody in the
immediate vicinity was kilkd. Th
tarranza authorities suppressed publi
cation of the news lest it stir th pea
