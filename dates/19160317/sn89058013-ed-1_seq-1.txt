Russian Empress Grateful ' for
Testaments :
A recent cablegram from Petro
grad to the Associated Press states
that the Empress of Russia' has
sent a letter to John Eilburn, sec
retary of the National Bible Socie
ty, expressing thanks on behalf of
Grand Duke Alexis, the nine-year-
old heir apparent to the Russian
throne, for a number of Testaments
given by American Sunday school
children to the Russian soldiers.

cent installment of. o.UUU Testa
ments which, it says, will . be sent
to the army by the Empress' own

young Grand Duke. Thirty-three
thousand Testaments have already
been distributed among the Rue

flexico A Desolated Land .
A missionary who has just re
turned to Mexico writes from Sal
tillo: v . .
"Mexico looks to be like a large
plant that has not had water for
some time. All the .railroad sta
tions from Nuevo Laredo to Mon
terey, inclusive, have been burned. .
We must liave seen the skeletons
of hundreds of freight cars which
have been burned, and also large
railroad water tanks that have been
dynamited. 'A large brewery ws
still standing near the station, and
this brewery saved Monterey from,
being iii;ruius, for I am told the
soldiers were tod drunk to carry on
the destruction . of the city after
having been at the brewery for a
time, . -
"The situation has changed for
the belter since the Carranzistas
have been here,' Foodstuff is com
ing from all sides, although the :
prices are high. Church services

missed holding at least one service

How: to Win.
"Wheu the war broke over the
world statesmen and leaders grap
pled with the liquor problem as
though "it were the one immediate
evil," says Vance Thompson in his
new book, "Drink aud Be Sober."
"Aud it was the immediate evil.
Until driufc. was chained and locked
away meu could not even kill each
other decently and with efficient
certainty. If the jgaine of death
can be played only in terms of so
briety, it is not unthinkable that
the game of life can best be won in
the same way." .
Mrs. Emma Lashlee has been
very sick, (nt is Mme better, .
