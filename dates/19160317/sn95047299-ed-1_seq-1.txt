PALATKA, FLORIDA
At a called meeting of the Board
of Governors of the Palatka board
of trade on Friday night last week,
Secretary E. W. Elliott, who has been
the guiding star of the board for the
past year, tendered his resignation.
Mr. Ellott stated that he had a busi
ness offer with the Merryday gro
cery Co., one that he could not af
ford to ignore, and while he thanked
the governors for their co-operation
and assistance in his work during the
year, he felt it incumbent upon him
to insist upon the acceptance of his
resignation.
The action of the popular secre
tary left the board in a bad way; it
would be without a secretary to look
after the correspondence and other
office work of the organiation. which
has grown to considerable propor
tions. The board offered to com
promise with Mr. Elliott, it offered
to get him an assistant secretary pro'
vided he would remain in charge, he
to name nis assistant.
Mr. Elliott considered a moment
and then proposed to continue for
ho present as secretary, without sal
ary, ana to install his ncpnew, Mer
cer Bai.-. to look after ihe office
work under his direction. This was
acceptable to the governors. .Mer
cer Davis is on deck therefore as as
sistant secretary of the board. Mr.
Elliott calls in each day and helps the
young man over the rough, or unac
customed places.
Mr. Elliott has made a premier sec
retary of the Palatka board of trade.
He is a mixer and a diplomat. He
has systematized the work and has
popularized the movement of the
trade body as no other secretary was
able to do. He is a business man
of the first order and this the new
ly organized Merryday Grocery Co.
was able to see and appreciate; they
grabbed him and Mr. Elliott is now
in the office of the. company helping
to build up the business, and to do
his part in securing a name for Pa
latka as a jobbing center.
The Merryday Grocery Co. is to be
congratulated; the Palatka board of
trade is to be commiserated.
Will Speak for a "Dry Am
erica" Rally Next Mon
day Night.
All Angels Red-Headed.
Bishop Quayle of the Methodist
Episcopal Church spoke at the Ham
lin club in St. Paul, Minn., recently
'in defense of tlv! red heads." .
s"The worll of men is divided into
wo parts." dre',ared tne bishop; "r'd
heads and bald heads, no one paying
any attention to anybody else.
"You girls who are not red heads
n begin to mend your ways at
once, and you boys who are not, I
should advise do nothing; you soon
will be bald heads anyway.
"All angels are red headed- at least
all pictures ever painted of angels
five them sorrel tops."
Those who want to hear possibly
the greatest platform orator in Am
erica, had better get into the Baptist
church early next Monday night.
The speaker will be Hon. John G.
Woolley, LL. D., one of the colossal
figures in the temperance reform,
with special reference to the move
ment for a nation-wide prohibition
movement.
John G. Woolley is a born orator,
which means much more than just be
ing a polished speaker, for, as has
been said of him. "he is that, tnn fn
he possesses that God-given power to
stir the hearts, awaken the conscien
ces ana compel conviction in the
minds of his hearers." He is humor
ous and witty and logical. Every
sentence of this great orator sparkles
with electric energy. He has been
for many years before the American
people, though it is doubtful if he
has ever before been in Florida to lec
ture.
In company with Dr. Geo. W. Mor
row, one of the leading Anti-Saloon
League workers of the country, Dr.
Woolley is making a campaign in the
interests of the Sheppard-Hobson
amendment to the constitution of the
United btates for nation-wide prohi
bition, and which will be presented to
me congress at an early day.
One of the crpat. Npw Wirt c.ilic
in referring to Dr. Woolley's address
at the National Anti-Saloon League
convention in Atlantic City last July
said: "His theme was "The Spirit of
me noaa.' it was aarvel of ora
tory. For more than an hour he
held the great audience under the
spell ot his impassioned eloquence,
it manes no aiiierence wnat men
may think of the prohibition Question
whether they be for it or ae-ainst it.
mere is not a man living who can
come away ffom hearing an address
by John G. Woolley without feeling
mai ne naa neard the speech of his
life.
The Palatka Baptist church will be
crowded to the doors next Monday
night, March 20th. There will be no
charge for admission; but it is like
ly that an offering will be made.
SCHOOL PUPILS HOLD
INTERESTING DEBATE
At Howell Theater Tuesday
Night Pomona School
Wins.
Miss Sipprell, County Agent.
Miss Josephine Sipprell of Flora-
one of the best known and
equippedqf our county teachers, who
last season principal ot the re
school, has been named by the
county school board as successor to
rs. Jessie Burton Collette, as Cpun-
Dcmonstrator, or Agent in charge
the Girls Gardening end Canning
home,
M
clubs.
This is a work which Mrs. Collette
tarted some two years ago in this
county and which she has worked up
great interest in among the school
girls of the county. She resigned
because of the smallness of the pay.
nd in her resignation the county
loses a most valuable instructor in a
ranch which is bound to be of incal
culable benefit to the future genera-
ion of women the girls of today.
Miss Sinnrell as her successor ap
pears to be a happy choice on the
part of the school board. She, too,
is fitted by nature and training for
this important work, and it is thought
that the county, after she has ob
tained her bearings, will lose little by
the change of demonstrators.

The Times-Union of Wednesday
carried nearly a column account of
the death of Thomas Costa, of Talla
hassee. It is seldom that a plain
citizen is given so much notice. This
was in recognition of the general es
teem in which Mr. Costa was held.
He held no official position, and hi3
walk in life was along the sequester
ed paths rather than in the high road
of publicity. Yet the death of no
man in Tallahassee could bring more
genuine regret to so many people.
If we look for a reason it can prob
ably be found in the cheeriness of
disposition and the uniform optimism
which were characteristic of this de
parted apostle of sunshine and hap
piness. He had a smile and a kind
word for all with whom he came in
contact during the day's routine, and
today it is borne home to those who
knew him that the world is better for
his having lived. No better tribute
could be paid any man. Unflaqreing
lovaltv to the cause of the confeder
acy was a fixed principle with him,
and he made it rule never to miss a
reunion. He was the life and main
stay of his local camp, and particular
ly in this rapidly thinning circle will
he be sadly missed. Orlando Repor-J

Potato Growers Tremble.
The cold of Wednesday night seems
to have done but little if any injury
in the East Palatka section. Mr.
W. A. Walton one of the big growers
says no. damage was sustained at his
farm. P. J. Becks and Thos. Mur
ray made a trip over the district
yesterday afternoon, and on their re
turn said that the potato fields looked
all right.
These gentlemen apprehended lit
tle trouble for Thursday night, the
wind seeming to have shifted to the
east. However, should the wind die
down the indications favored a frost,
in which event the notato fie ds
would be seriously damaged.
This is Some Tooth.
Our friend H. C. Waldron of East
Palatka is responsible for this:
"Just come up from a visit with
my father-in-law, Mr. N. E. Doug
lass of Welaka. While there I took
a trip out on Lake George with W. H.
Cannon and Tom Pouglass, who were
seining for fish. We were over
near the west shore of the lake when
the seine was pulled in. In the catch
was a giant tooth. The tooth weigh
ed four pounds and was seven inches
long and four inches wide. It was
broken some, but the roots were
there and a line of demarkation
showing the part above the jaw. Mr.
Cannon has the tooth, but no one
seems to be able to guess the kind
of an animal who had the face to
grow such a monster."
An interesting debate between the
prize orators of the Palatka and Po
mona schools was the attraction at
Howell theater on Tuesday evening.
I he Pomona school was represented
by Causey Green, Robert Middleton
and Miss Grace Wells.
Palatka's school team was made uo
of Warren Sleap, Norman Currie and
Fannie Wilsotti
The theater was well-filled with
people, many of whom were children
from the schools interested, though
of course the Palatka boys and girls
greatly out-numbered those from PO'
mona.
Rev. Robert S. White, pastor of
tne romona Congregational church
was made chairman of the meeting,
and the judges were Rev. E. H. By-
rons of Pomona, Hon. Henry Hutch
inson and Geo. B. Everson of this
city.
The subject, while The News has
not the exact wording, was: "Resolved
that the preparedness program as
outlined by President Wilson, should
be accepted.
The affirmative side was taken by
the Palatka debaters, while Pomona
held the negative side.
Well, it was indeed interesting to
hear these young people discuss this
great national question, a question
that is just now agitating the people
of the whole country. Those who
have thought little on the subject, had
they been present to hear these young
people discuss it, would have come
away assured that they had been do
ing some thinking. Their points for
and against showed that. In this the
boys were not alone. The girls are
some debatersi, and unless we mis
take the signs of the times they will
be able to hold their own in any fu
ture discussions, be they in the fam
ily, the church or the state.
When the debate was concluded
and the judges had compared notes,
it was announced by the chair thet
the decision was in favor of Palatka,
two of the judges being for the Pa
latka school and one for Pomona.
Mr. Byrons, who lives at Pomona, an
nounced that his decision was for the
affinitive, the Palatka side.
this decision was so published.
But after the meeting had adiouni-
ed Mr. Byrons discovered that he had
made a mistake. Rev. Mr. White,
chairman of the meeting, when he
found this out, got busy on the tele
phone and called up the Palatka
judges, assuring them that Mr. By
rons had made a mistake in giving
the decision to the affirmative in
stead of the negative.
Both Mr. Everson and Mr. Hutch-
ersoninson assure The News that Mr.
Byrons called off his fieures as fa
voring the affirmative.
Anyway the points were so close
that it is going to take some more
debates to thoroughly settle in the
minds of hearers which really excell
ed; both were excellent.
The figures, as they stand correct
ed are:
Judge Byrons Pomona. 370: Palat
ka, 289.
Judge Hutchinson Pomona, 81;
Palatka, 79.
Judge Everson Pomona, 94 1-3:
Palatka, 95 1-3.
In the original report Judge By
rons had his figures reversed.
In connection with the mistake of
Rev. Mr. Byrons, one of the judges.
The News has received the following
letter trom Kev. K. S. White, the
chairman of the debate.

ORANGE SPRINGS ROAD
Bonding Election on Tues
day Gave Big Majority
for Bonds.
That there will soon be a fine,
broad highway leading from Palatka
through Rodman and Kenwood to
beautiful Orange Springs was settled
by the votes of the precincts through
which the road will traverse at a spe
cial election last Tuesday.
Tha vfa ...nn . l r .
... tv1s naa nearly iour to one in
favor of bonding for the proposed
road.
The road to be built is in distance
about 20 miles long, and will form a
connecting link in a highway which
will lead from Jacksonville through
Palatka and Ccala to Tampa. This
20 miles just approved is to be con
structed of sand-asphalt and will cost
a little over $80,000, the amount to
cover expense of engineer and bridges
and all other matters connected with
the building.
Among the tax-payers along this
line of road, the small farmer will
cut but little figure. A great part of
the country through which the road
passes is owned by the Rodman Lum
ber Company, of which Mr. H. S.
Cummings is the head, and the Flor
ida Farms & Homes, Inc., of which
latter corporation Col. James R. Mur
phy is president and general manager.
Speaking of this Mr. Murphy re
minds us that at the last meeting of
the board of county commissioners he
appeared before that body p.nd made
a most liberal proposition. It was
this: That if the commissioners
would keep the hard road between
Palatka and Edgar in repair all the
time, he would bear one-half the ex
pense. .That is Murphy all over. He
doesn't want any good thing for noth
ing; he is willing at all times to pay
his part of the score and a little more.
Mayor by Acclamation.
The city convention last Friday
night nominated Hon. W. P. Merriam,
the present mayor, for another term
by acclamation.
Mr. Merriam was not a candidate in
the sense that he was a seeker for
the office. He would only take it on
condition that it was given him by
the free will of the voters of Palatka.
Well, it was so given.
Mr. Merriam has been mavor for
the past several months by virtue cf
his office as president of the city
council, and became mayor on the
death of the late lamented S. J. Ken
nedy. He is a gentleman of wide ac
quaintance, connected with the Wilson
Cypress Co. and one of the members
of the corporation known as the Flor
id" Woodenware Co.. of this city. Pa
latka is to be congratulated on its
prospect for having such a man to
head its municipal government during
the coming year.
Mr. Byrons informed me last nisriit
after the debate that he had given
his largest number of points to Po
mona as you will see 'by the enclosed.
Mr. Hutchinson, informed me that he
had given Pomona one more than Pa
latka (should have been two, as you
will find when you divide the sum
total by three.) This of course as
you will readily see gave Pomona his
vote. He was under the impression
that he was the only one who stood
for Pomona. When I informed him
that Rev. Mr. Byrons had also given
Pomona the largest number of points,
he immediately replied that if that
was true Pomona team won. I call
ed up Mr. Everson and gave him the
particulars. He said that he had
misunderstood Rev. Mr.' Byrons then.
He thought that ha had voted for Pa
latka and according to this Pomona
had won. Said also that he would
immediately start in to set things
right
I have the original of the' enclosed
signed by the two out of the three
juges. I am holding them so as to
have them to produce when desired.
I was the one who presided over the
meeting last evening and I feel that
it is my duty as soon as possible to
set things right. Any thing that you
can do to help will be very much
appreciated.
ROBERT S. WHITE,
Accompanying the copies of the
figures of Messrs. Hutchinson and
Byrons, is an affidavit duly executed
by Mr. White before Horn W. S. Mid
dleton, justice of the peace, to the ef-
Piano Day at High School.
Palatka is soon to have an oppor
tunity of witnessing a very beautiful
and unique affair and also the privi
lege of contributing to the musical
education of Palatka's children.
April 7th has been set apart by the
primary department of the Palatka
school as "Piano Day," and on that
day contributions for the piano soon
to be installed will be srratefullv re
ceived.
At 4 p. m. the same day there will
be a bird concert given by the pri
mary department on. the court house
lawn. Prof. Chattaway has kindly
offered a 4-piece orchestra for the
occasion and the whipper-will, night-in-gales,
fairies, flowers etc. will
make the scene a most beautiful one.
It is hoped that the people of Palat
ka will give it their heartiest support.
A piano for the primary department
has long been a dire necessity and the
teachers have been greatly handicapp
ed by this lack. If you searched
this wide land over you could not find
a modern, up-to-date primary school
without a piano and proper musical
training for the younger children.
Why? Simply because if a child is
not taught to love, understand, and
sing music in the early school days
he will not do it later. Other things
crowd into his life, he is not so re
ceptive, his voice is not so easily cul
tivated. Palatka, are you going to be a
drag to your future citizens, or an
inspiration ? Are you going to have
them look back upon you with dis
gust, with the feeling that you failed
them in their necessity, or will they
look with love upon the city that
helped to the worth-while things of
life? For music is worth while.
Shakespeare, that grim old traee-
nnr, thoroughly understood that, for
h wrote
'ThP man that hath no music in himself.
Nor is not moved with concord of
sweet sounds,
Is fit for treason, stratagem, and
spoils"
No one understands the value of
music better than our modern educa
tors. Listen to Dr. G. Stanley Hal!,
Prof, of Clark University. "Music
is the language of the heart and edu
cation in music is cominer to occudv
a higher and yet higher place in our
school life." Also, we find in one
of our best music journals, "Love and
appreciation of the truly good and
excellent is developed in the early
stages of school life, and one of the
most powerful influences is in the
periodical giving of Musical Festi
vals, Bird Concerts, etc"
This wave of musical enthusiasm
that is sweeping Palatka from cen
ter to circumference is not of cy
clonic origin, neither is it a tidal
wave, but it is the slow sure growth
of progress, and has grown out of the
vital necessity of Palatka's Children.
We love them and if it is within our
power to give them the best of life, it
is theirs.
It is hoped that the Bird Concert
of April 7th, will be only the begin
ning of our city's awakening.

iso one m raiatka doubts Mr.
Byrons' statement that he made a
mistake. However, it was unfortu
nate that he did not discover his error
before the meetine adjourned, so that
the audience would not have gone
away under a wrong impression.
