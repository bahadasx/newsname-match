AMSTERDAM. .March 17.?The' lie*
est. and tines;. steamship sailing uudi
the Dutch Hag. the Tubanlia. of tl
Holland-Lloyd line, was sunk short
before dawn yesterday thirty miles c
the Dutch coast. Although It is ni
positively established whether tl
sinking was due to a tuinc or a to
pedo there is a singular unanimity r
the partof those who were on boat
in attributing it to a submarine ac
The crew bases its belief in this r<
gard chiefly on the intense violent
of the explosion and on the fact tht
it occurred amidships.
The vessel was outward hound froi
Amsterdam to South American port
t arrying a crew of 294 and eight;
two passengers, the latter mostly net
trals, including three Americans. Tl
ship bore the usual identiflcatio
marks of its neutral character inclut
jng an illuminated name and flag.
The disaster has created a profoun
sensation throughout Holland, whei
the ship was a great popular favoril
owing to its size and luxurious a]
pointments. The press comments rt
fleet anger and indignation.
It is now believed there was
small number of lives lost in the sinl
ing of the Tubantia, either in the e:
plosion or in' an accident which a
tended the launching of a lifeboat
According to all reports there wa
no panic, everyone on board behavin

In their'appointed order and the pat
sengers were all taken off first Th
rescue work was difilcult owing to th
darkness and the heavy sea. The boat
were several hours in finding th
Noordhinder lightship, which was tw

This is an advance of ton cents a *

Failure of repeated ndvances In the 1

Mr. Griffin has just returned from <

tor in the oil fields there. * '
The trip from India to this country '
was a very eventful one and Mr. <
Griffin relates many interesting and ?
amusing incidents, relative to the 1
constant fear and watch for subma- <
rines, mines and torpedoes. Remark- <
log on this, Mr. Griffin said that while
crossing the Mediterranean, It was a t
common occurrence for nervous pas- t
' sengers to "see" all manners of sub- c
marines and, torpedoes. Their con- t
stant warnings, generally proving t
only a "white cap" or a piece of t
floating timber, were soon disregard- i

On arrival In London, Mr. Griffin t
said the changed appearance of that i

He describes'the damage done by

of a short delay in Its scheduled de- t

American troops under command of

mntlnued their hunt for Francisco
Pllla remained unconfirmed Friday. #!
Sniping and even the possible ki|lng
or wounding of a few American
soldiers by these long ranged marksmen
was not regarded here is an Indication
that the United States army's I
march Into Mexico tip to date was
otherwise than a peaceful expedition
to far as a majority of the?Mex!can
leople are concerned, - : S
A few definite facta about the Amor,
can expedition Friday stood out with
jonslderable clearness as the resuii
>f official published reports'and tho
jews brought here by Americana, who
iave been in touch with some portion
if the American movement; It seems
sertaln that of the two columns/ which
ire "somewhere In Mexico," one was

The scorecy which has surrounded ho
movements of the main column ba?
ieen slight compared with, the jreoonl
if this western force. There Is reaon
to believe that the western column
nay have gone Into Mexico pearlier
