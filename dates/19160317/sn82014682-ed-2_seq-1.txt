create a home where children may be born and reared to be better men
and women than their parents are. "More and better babies' is, the slogan

Good parentage means both a father and a mother.-. It. Is violated by
separation and divorce' It is violated by industrial conditions thaT cause

So far I have read "of none that emphasizes life and good j parentage. But
tbe right to space Is emphasized.' Babies have a right to. as spacious and

But more than all, babies have a right to appreciation and affection.
Our exhibits are showing us how we can prove to our babies as well as
to each other that we love .them wisely. Not only do we exhibit the things
that make for proper clothing, food and ventilation, but exhibits are made
- of children's interests. We want our. babies to grow into healthy,' happy
.childhood. Play In the house, play in the yard, pets, books, gardens, wood
