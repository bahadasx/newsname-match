International News Service:
WASHINGTON, March 17. That
Germany will disavow the attempt
ed torpedoing of the French liner
Patria if it shall be shown that a
German submarine was responsible
and will deny that any of its U boats
had any part in the sinking of the
Royal Dutch liner Tubantia. was
considered certain in official circles
today. Rut a disavowal will hardly
satisfy it was learned, because the
one thing that Pres't Wilson has in
sisted on in all of the exchanges
growing out of the Lusltania case
has been that unless action was
taken which would absolutely pre
vent a submarine commander "mak
ing mistakes," promises that inter
national law would be observed
would be worthless.
Under instructions from Counsellor
Polk, acting secretary of state,
agents of the department today
were taking affidavits of the officers
and passengers of the Patria. It is
understood that none of the Amer
icans who were on hoard saw the
torpedt) or any indications of a sub-
I marine.

evidence Is reviewed ry Mr. I'oik a
note of inquiry will be sent to Ber

governments there assume respon
sibility for the attack. On the re
ply will depend further develop
ments. So far as the Tubantia is con
cerned the state department has
asked that the various consular rep
resentatives in position to learn the
facts m: ke a report by cable at
once. In view of the fact, that the
big Dutch liner was sunk during the
night, it is not expected here that it
will he possible to place responsibil
ity as to whether she was torpedoed
or struck a mine. This is likely to
interfere with any action hy this

After pointing out the war ex

Dr. Helfferich took occasion to say
that the war has greatly increased
the public interest in the national

The budget .balances with a $120.

Dr. Helfferich criticized sharply
certain critics of the government
who had said that the government
had promised no new taxes would
be- necessary.
"The thing that I did say." con
tinued Ir. HelfTerich, "was that new
taxes ought to be avoided as long
as the regular budget r-.nd the sur
plus provided by the national debt
balanced them and made them un
necessary." Dr. Helfferich compared the finan
cial strength of Germany with that
of England and France, saying:
"Bp to the present Germany has
floated $6.250,000,000 war loans
whereas France has not raised even
$2.." 00,000.000 and Ivigland has
