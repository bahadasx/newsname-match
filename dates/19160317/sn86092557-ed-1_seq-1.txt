People on Tubantia Positive
Submarine. Was Respon
sible -for Disaster.
(By Associated Press)"
AMSTERDAM, via London, March
17.?The newest and finest steamship
sailing under the Dutch flag, the Tub
antlB, of the Holland-Lloyd line, was
sunk shortly before, dawn yesterday
30 miles oil the Dutch coast. Although
it is not positively established wheth
er tho sinking was due to mine or tor
pedo there is a singular unanimity on
the part of those who were aboard in
attributing it to submarine attack.
The crew based their belief in this
regard chiefly on the intense violence
of the explosion and on the fact that
it occurred amidships.
Tho vessol was outward bound from
Amsterdam to South American ports
carrying a crew of 294 and 82 passen
gers, tlie latter mostly neutrals, in
cluding, it .is said, three; Americans.
The ship bore the usual Identifica
tion marks of a neutral'character, in
cluding an Illuminated name and flag.
The disaster has created a profound
sensation throughout Holland where
the ship was a popular favorite owing
to its size and luxurious appointments.
The press comments reflect anger and
indignation.
It Is now believed there was a small
number of UveB lost in the sinking of
the Tubantla either in the explosion
or in an accident which attended the
launching of. life boats. - ,
The-ship remained afloat several
hours. According to all reports there
was no panic, everyone aboard behav
ing splendidly; The boats were launch
ed in the appointed order and passen
gers were all taken off first. The res
cue work was difficult owing to dark
ness, heavy mist and rough sea. The
boats wero several hours in finding
the Noordhlnder- lightship which was
two i miles away.
The captain and part of the crew re
mained on the gradually sinking ship
for some time,' the wireless operator
keeping up the work of guiding Dutch
vessels to the rescue.
The captain was on the vessel for
two hours after! she was .struck and
was the last to, leave.", The rescuing
vessels took the possengenrs and crew'
to Fleshltig, Amsterdam and>the Hook.
