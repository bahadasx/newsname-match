New Departure in Threshing Machine
is Invention of Monroe Davis.
A machine which may revolutionize
the grain threshing industry of the
country the invention of Mr. Monroe
Davis was demonstrated at Enid, Ok
lahoma, recently.
The machine which weighs only 2100
pounds employs only centrifugal force
in removing the grain from the stalk
and separating it from the chaff. With
this machine oats were threshed in a
satisfactory manner and at a high rate
of speed. It is claimed for the machine
that it will thresh grain more economi
ally and better than the large machines
in present use. The inventor claims
that he can re-thresh Ithe straw from
the ordinary machine and get grain
enough to make the threshing pay.
The machine has neither concave,
cylinder teeth screen or riddle; no cog
wheels and only eight places to oil; and
feeds automatically by picking the
bundles from the ground.
A machine of this kind should be a
boon to the rli (. growers as the absence
of teeth wou ell inate the breaking
of the grain.'
TL:. invernt r of the new thresher,
Mr. Monrue Davis is a brother of our
uncle Tom D vis, and 73 years old.

The audience wa.; ,c-r.p, sed of 'Iar-kir
supporters who stougiht the trinu iight

were inquisitive though skeptical; little'
children who caime solely to seo the

traction and were impatient that they
should have to sit through so much talk
waiting for the film idols to appear on
the screen; and lastly mothers who
came along rather than suend Saturday
evening at home alone.
With the candidates on the rostrum
when the curtain lifted were Messrs.
W. E. Byerly, Lucien Corbello, Jno.
Narrans, Dolze Bourgeois, Dan Does

C. Carr, E. D. Lewis and Chas. F. Buck
Jr. who had journeyed hither a.purpose
to be present at this great meeting.
Mr. Chas. E. Carr called the meeting
to order, leaving to the Hon. Chas. F.
Buck Jr. the distinguished honor of in.
troducing the speakers.
Mr.' Buck stated that he had his
views but wouMl leave the discussion
of the political situation to the candi.
dates, introdudlng, first, Edwin M.
Broussard of New Iberia, brother of
"Cousin Bob," the progressive candi.
date for Lieutenant governor.
Mr. Broussard addressed the audi.
ence in French and from the look of
intelligence and the smiles of approval
which pervaded the countenance of
many of the purely English speaking
people present we take it for granted
they were thoroughly convinced of Mr.
Broussard's sincerety and honesty of
purpose and pleased with his manner
and oratory, but he failed to draw any
notable applause from the French
speaking people.
Closing his remarks in English Mr.
Broussard made one potent statement
which carried conviction to the heart
of every one of his hearers, democrats
included. He aid "Neither Mr. Parker
or himself had made any pre eletton
promises." Their platform should be
easily followed IF they were ele, ea,
which, of course remains for the v.
to decide.
In opening hi.s address Mr. Pdarkter
stated that he had hoped to meet his
opponent in joilnt debate before a
Welsh audience, abhoring the assertion,
which he hinted orginated in this sec
tion, that his opponent would draw the
crowd, giving him the advantage of a
large hear ing.
He advocated an early constitutional
convention claiming that the present
cconstitution was entirely inadequate,
and in this connection he took occasion
to administer to t!h, legal profession of
thestateda terribie ir ubbing. Gra,
bing them by tlie tape of the neck he
shook from theret thir glamor, stripped
them of their gi v, gouged them, aind
left them thus torn and bleeding at the
mercy of constitution which plain
business men would draft-pure, sweet,
and so simple that a school boy could
interpret its every clause.
Mr. Parker also advocated the aboli
tion of the primaries, a time honored
system which be claims is farcial. His
views on the land law and stock loan
systems took very well with the entire
audience, and in that position he found
himself striking a harmonions chord,
Mr. Parker eliminated a portion of
his usual address, having of course a
few remarks to make about "Boss"
Bob. Ewing. He is credited with bit
terly attacking his opponents and the
pink ticket system in an address in El
ton Saturday morning. He remarked
that when-not if, but when--he was
elected he would devote all of his time
to farming. Probably so. ,
We take serious exception to one of
Mr. ParKer's salient remarks, I e, that
there were but two newspapers in the
whole state supporting the regular
democratic nominees,
Though we have no eXtreme personal
feelings in the matter we know this is
not the case, and the facts will dawn~
upon the Hon. Juo. M. on April 18th.

them celebrate the occasion. Afteri ad
journment the hostess served a delightl

A New Design in Private Garages
iHas just been completed by G. B.
Evans, local salesman for The Texas
Oil Co,, at Jennings, La., near his re
sidence on sherman St., north of the
Brick Yard.
th- building is 12x16, 8 feet high,
boarded onlboth sides and the rear with
rough 18l and the sheeting is shiplap.
The roof is covered with Texaco Roof.
tog. The sides are then paneled with
0. G. bats and the bats painted. Thei
front is shiplap with two sliding doors.
This makes the garage dust and damp
proof and is more economical then hIron
or brick and not so hot as an iron build
ing. The idea of covering a building al
over with roofing is a new one, and any
old farm house or cabin that is boarded
with rough boards can be made attrac
tive and comfortable at a small cost.
The old shingle roof can Je covered
with roofing as well. Make a nice de
sign for a summer house or bungalow
Texaco Roofing is manufacted by The
Tiexas Company, at Port Arthur, Texas
Is sold by most all Lumber' Dealers, ot
the Texas Oil Co., of Jennings, Elton oi
Welsh. Implement dealers and Hard
ware dealers, everywhere. It is made
to suit this southern climate. Mr
Evans will be pleased to furnish sped
ficatlons and information on how t,
build a private garage of this style. C
