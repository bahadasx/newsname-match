P. T. Barnum said, "The
Amerioan people like to be hum
bugged." In no other way is
this statement of the great show
man so well proved as by the de
mand for medicines and the blind
faith the average person puts in
drugs.
We import into this Country
every year more than $100,000,-

person believo that there is any
necessity for this, or that it cn

drugs are taken by people with
out the advioe of a physioian and
without any special knowledge
as to their proper use, either as
to quantity or as to period of time
during which they are taken. Il
goes without saying that a drug
which is powerful enough to pro
duce effects in illness must pro
duce ill effects in health when
'taken over a considerable period
j0f lime or in large doses. It has
been well said that when we give

Treatment and diet are more
efficacious in tho cure of mot,!
diseases than are drugs. The
great maj irily of diseases are
self limited, and get well them
selves, and the effort of a con
scientious physician is lo assist
nature in bringing about the
cure. Drugs have little effect
in most diseases except for tlie
relief of syrnylcms. When used
at all, they should be given un
der tiie direction of a competent
physician. It is imperative that
the composition of medicines
and the dosage should be known.

.Ackl Soils.
Some plants do not grow on
acid or neutral soils as well as on
alkaline soils, while some plmiH
prefer acid soils. Sour soils oc
cur more often in humid than in
arid regions. They also occur
more frequently in poorly drain
ed than in well drained plHCes.
Acidity may be caused by free
acids, or may be due to a lack of
bases. This last ought to be
called a neutral soil but since
plants usually grow equally well
on acid and poor soil, we use but
the "lie term Acid Soil.
A iinmher'of things will cause
a soil lo become aoid. Large
amounts of lime are removed in
tho drainage water. Tlie decay
ot organic matter causes much
on i b. n dioxide ttiid uitrio acid to
be formed. Growing plants re
cover the nitric acid but the our-
'"on dioxide aod other bases are
large ly lott. In our latitude the
di'Oi.y uf organic matier contin
ues nearly llii'ouchoiil the entire
year. As this decay is more
rapid near the surface, we find
the surfacu soil more sour than
the sub-soil.
Growing plants use more lime
and other bases than tiiey do
acids. In ordinary farming
where the entire crop is removed,
(his is quite a factor In forming
acid soils. The plowing under
of green manure, while not
ohaniing the total amount of
acid or basio products in the soil,
does, for a time, make soils more
sour by the union of the organic
aoids with suoli basic material as
was already present in 'he soil'.
The continued use of such fer
tilizers as acid phosphate and
ammonium sulphate, add to the
a'iidity of the soil. Soils derived
from limestone are not usually
acid, but many such soils and
soils uuuerlu'u Willi limestone
are of'.en benefited by the use of
lime.
In a future arliu'e we will dis
cuss the plants adnpted to both
acid and alkaline soils.
