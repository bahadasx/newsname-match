Young Inventor
Visited Beach
Apparatus Perfected for Harnessing
the Wind to Generate Electricity
for the Farm at a Triffling Cost-
During the past week Beach was
.favored with a visit by George Man
ikowske, of Richland County, this
state. Mr. Manikowski is the inven
tor of a windmill for generating el
ectric current. The device is pecu
liarly adapted to meet the needs
-of the farmer.
This novel invention has been
the subject of widespread comment
by the Agricultural College at Far
.go—which has devoted a special bul
letin to a description of the device
and its utility on the farm—and by
such magazines and periodicals as
-Good Housekeeping, Popular Mech
anics, County Gentleman, and oth
ers.
The invention of a windmill that
would generate electric current had
been the hope of many an expert
but it remained for this young man—
born and raised on a farm in this
state—to invent a device that really
would meet all the varied demands
of the farmer in the way of electric
light and power. Mr. Manikowske's
apparatus is novel. It is operated
at a triffling cost, and is made to
stand and will stand the test of
years. Besides, there is practically
no limit to the uses to which it may
be put on the ordinary farm.
On the farm of the inventor's fa
ther in Richland County the wind
mill has now been in very successful
operation for six years. The farm
is a large one, comprising some
1100 acres. Some 80 lights have
been in use there, including a large
light for the barnyard, besides 4
motors. This plant has undergone
".most trying tests during these years
with the result that the possibilities
of the. device appear even greater
than before. Plants have been es
tablished at various other places—
one at Cleveland, N. I)., one at En
derlin, N. D., and one at the Santee
Normal Training School, Santee,
Nebraska. All these have given en
lire satisfaction.
The invention has been patented
both in the United States and in
Canada.
In the words of the inventor:
""This windmill, or rather the electric
-current generated by it, will pump
water into the attic of the house,
and elsewhere it. will run the wash
ing machine, the electric fan, the
'vacuum cleaner, the flat iron, the
hot plate, the emery wheel, the
grindstone, the forge, the drill press,
the drill, the butter churn, the
cream separator, the ic-e cream
freezer, the fanning mill it will
charge the batteries for the auto
mobile, and can be used in vulcan
izing automobile tires, to say noth
ing of lighting the house, the barn
and other buildings. All these things
and more are possible with this ap
paratus."
By means of the storage battery
which is installed in connection with
the plant the farmer is insured el
ectric current at all time. In days
when .the wind is sufficient the wind
mill will generate and store enough
onrrent to last the farmer during
"Jays when not even breeze I
svirriug.

Perhaps at an early dale a com
plete outfit will be installed on one
of the Golden Valley farms, to be
selected with the idea of having
close at hand a plant in actual op
eration, for demonstration purposes.
The inventor wishes the plant to
do its own talking.
While -at Beach Mr. Manikowske

was the guest of Attorney John L.

regarding the invention and the plana
for manufacturing the apparatus
on an extensive scale to fill present
and future demands.

BLACH,
Woman and Little
Babe Drowned
Sad Accident Occurs on Cabin Creek
When Team Became Mired, Up
Setting Wagon and Drowning Mrs.
Mercer and Child.
The news reached Beach today of
the tragic death by drowning of Mrs.
Chris Mercer and two-year-old child
on Cabin Creek, Montana. The ac
cident occurred Tuesday afternoon
near the Lon Caldwell place.
Due to the melting snows, Cabin
Creek is above its usual level, though
no danger was anticipated in af­
fecting a crossing. It appears that
Mrs. Mercer had been visiting
neighbors, and was returning home
in a farm wagon belonging to Bill
McNannum, who was driving. There
were but three in the conveyance,
After getting into the stream, the
horses became mired in the treach
erous mud, and becoming frightened
Mr. McNannum was unable to con
trol them. The plunging of the ani
nulls resulted in overturning the wa
gon, precipitating the occupants in
to the water. Mr. McNannum, we
understand, became entangled with
'lie struggling horses, and by the
time he was able to extricate him
self Mrs. Mercer and babe had sue
cuinbed to the icy water. Both hor
ses were drowned, and Mr. McNan
nam himself narrowly escaped death
At the time the news was brought
ta Beach, the bodies had not been
recovered.
Mrs. Mercer was a cousin by a
doption to the Douglas families near
Carlyle, antf with her husband re
sided on a homestead in the Cabin
Creek country. She has relatives
residing at Indianapolis, Ind., her
fIrmcr home, MIK have been wired
and pending their reply, definite fun
oral arrangements have not beeii
made. It is probable that services
will be held at the Cuvlyu el.urch
a-.d in ferment made in "lie ceme
tery ihere. She i. survived
Uv
her
husband and two children.
Mr. McNannum is well known in
Beach, having been a former resi
dent here, afterward taking up a
homestead in the Cabin Creek
country, where he has since made
his home.

Golden Valley's Leading Newspaper By Virtue of Circulation and Prestige
A Newspaper that Causes Comment in a Town that is Talked About
(I'rom The Fargo Forma)
actional politics, long the curse of the city of Beach, county
seat of Golden alley county, have been buried through the or
ganization of the Beach Chamber of Commerce, launched with a
charter membership of over 200 business men, arid which bids fair
to gi\c Beach and the various towns along the valley extension of
(iie Northern Pacific, new interest in life.
Long recognizing the need for unity of action, and with splen
did natural advantages favoring their city, the business men of
Beach have finally successfully disposed of the long standing con
flict that has been so disastrous to their city.
That Beach wiil, under the direction of the Commercial club,
seek to bring about better conditions for the city, and that it will
attain a greater measure of prosperity through the abandonment of
old-time conditions, is the general opinion of the business men of
the city. They are all determined to make Beach "the best bet in
the state."
The newly organized club is headed bv J. P. Reeve, former
member of the state legislature, successful farmer and business
man, and who is just as confident of the future of Beach as is the
average man in the certainty of a hereafter.
E. E. Dickinson, owner of the largeest store in Beach, and a
real pioneer of the city, a man who made his money in Beach ud
who believes in giving his time and his money for the advancem -at
of the city, is vice president of the organization.
For the post of secretary, the club has been fortunate in se
curing the services of T. E. Ilayward, former president of the Man
dan Commercial club. Mr. Ilayward came to Beach four months
ago, and is cashier of the Golden Valley State Bank.
As a means of placing the club on a sound financial basis, a
$3,000 budget has- been raised.
It is proposed to include in the membership, not only the busi
ness men of Beach, but the farmers in the district and business
men along the Carlisle extension of the N. P. road. The club will
work for the general advancement of the entire district.

Enviable Record
Has Liquidated All Obligations and
Owes Not a Penny—Funds Show
Substantial Balance.
Golden Valley county does not
owe a dollar, and is, probably, the
only county in the state to boast
of such an enviable record.
Each of the various county funds
showed a substantial balancc on
(he first day of March, and today
there is not an outstanding warrant
awaiting payment, the Chronicle has
been informed by County Auditor
McCarthy.
All county properly has been paid
for, besides the liquidation of $8,
000.00 paid to old Billings county
on the division settlement. Nearly
$0,000.00 also has been paid for
roads and bridges since the
organ­
ization of Golden Valley county.
Other obligations have been mat,
and today, out of liftyone counties
in the state, Golden Valley is the on
ly one which can boast of a clean
slate. This should be a matter of
pride and gratification to every res
ident, and speaks well of the safe,
sane and economic administration
of those county officials having the
disbursements ,,i' the county finan
ces in charge.

FULL DETAILS OF THE
MARCH INTO MEXICO
MADE PUBLIC TODAY
—NO HINDRANCE
San Antonio, March 10.—The
first report from General Pershing,
to Funston stating that all is going
well was received at Fort Sam
Houston. The report dealt with the
strength of Pershing's command,
disposition of various units and
ol'liccrs, the distance of the first days
march and movements of Carranza
troops. All these details however
come under censorship and were not
made public.
1'uiiston arranged a direct govern
ment wire to Columbus, N. M. At
the same time it was announced that
General Pershing might make fre
quent (rips between the field forces
and Columbus. In this way the
commander of the expeditionary for
ce?. can keep in close touch with the
head of the southern department.
Columbus, X. M., March 10.—Am­
erican expedition which entered
.Mexico yesterday spent an unevent­
ful night, encamped but a short dis­
tance across (he American line.
Some of Villa's men, according to
a report here, are down in Ascen
sion. But Columbus, slept more
soundly last night than at any time
since the horrors of exactly one week
ago. Despite the rigorous censor
ship which closed all wires, tele
graph and telephone to military
news, the story of the crossing got
out. The facts follow
About 10 o'clock yesterday morn
ing troops fell in at their camp in
full marching order. The order to
move came about 11 o'clock and
was answered by a shout from the
men. Then the column started out.
The cowboys off the ranges, en
rolled as scouts, and cavalry led
the way. Two infantry regiments
some field artillery and a wagon
train came after.
The departure of the force was
unmarked by a single dramatic de
tail. It was as business-lil'.e as a
practice march.
A long, hazy line of alkali dust,
standing out against the dull white
of the plains and the blazing light
of the sun, marked the progress to­
17, 1916
ward the border. General Pershing
accompanied the force as far as
the border but came back later in the
tfternoon and took another direc
tion on the flank with a part of the
troops.
The troops taking part in the
movement numbered about 5,000,
composed of the thirteenth cavalry,
sixth and sixteenth infantry and
other details that have been en
camped here.
During the preceding night, it is
said that Colonel Slocum met I he
Colonel Davila of the Mexicans,
who promised that no resistance
would he made to crossing the bor
der. At any rate (here was no re
sistance made, but the entire Mexi
can population in Palomas, soldiers
and civilians, with one exception,
cleared a way. When the Ameri
cans passed through this town on
crossing the border, they saw the
one exception, an aged, crippled man,
a beggar, without a family.
Some aeroplanes are believed to
have passed in with the expedition
in motor trucks. Flying conditions,
owing to the clearness of the at
mosphere, were ideal. But for local
topography, the army will rely on
its cowboy scouts.
The columns leaving Columbus are
thoroughly equipped for all condi
tions that might arise and are re
presented by all arms of the ser
vice.
Nogales, Ariz., March 10.—Tran
quillity prevailed on both sides of
the Mexican border in this section
The first ericis of excitement among
the Mexicans was at the news that
the American march had passed
here. Nogales was heavily patrolled
all night by American troops. Fifty
men of Carranza garrisons remain
ed in the Mexican toivn of Nogales.
Other several hundred has been with
drawn south over night. They are
reported en route eastward along
the American border headed for Na
co, the Mexican side of I he Arizona
town of that name. American train
crews have refused to make their
iun between Nogales and llcrmo
sillo, Mexico, and Mexican crews
have replaced them.
El l'aso, Tex., March Hi.—New
nd powerful army units are rap
idly forming along the Mexican bor
der to fill gaps left yesterday when
the lirM expeditionary army enteicd
Mexico from two points on I lie New
Mexican line. In El Paso Brigadier
General George I*11, .Jr., moved in
to Mexico. Bell is busy gathering a
new organization and attending to
the supply problem.
Washington, March 1 (I.—rPresident
Wilson was informed by Secretary
Baker that both columns of Ameri
can troops now in Mexico in pursuit
of Villa and Jiis bandits are meeting
with hearty co-operation from Car
ranza soldiers.
USED DUM DUM BULLETS
American-Made Variety Used By
Villa in Columbus Raid.
Chicago, March 14.—American
made dum duin bullets and American
-made guns were used by the Villa
forces in their raid on Columbus, N#
M., according to Private Stephen
Wicczorkiewicz of the Seventh Unit
ed States infantry, who helped in
repulsing the raiders and took part
in their pursuit across the border.
Wieczorkiewicz made this statement
while passing through Chicago on
his way home in Toledo, Ohio. He
exhibited soft nosed bullets of the
dum dum type and asserted they
were taken from the belts of the
thirteenth cavalry at Columbus.
S. O. Sanderson, who has been
spending the winter with relatives
and frineds in southern Minnesota
returned Wednesday, and after a
day or two in Beach returned to
bis home at Carlyle, where he is en
gaged in farming operations.
A Beach Booster
Beach Banks to
be Reserve A"«nts
Cfttate Historical SocUtf
Fufuriujie Action Secured When
Reeve and Haywaru of the Beach
Chamber Appeared Before State
Banking Board Monday—Will
Mean Much for Golden Valley.
J. P. Reeve, president of our re
cently organized Chamber of Com­
merce, and Thos. E. Ilayward, sec
retary, appeared before a special
meeting of the State Banking Board
in Bismarck last Monday to re
quets that body to recognize th®
business growth that has taken
place in our city and grant it the
same privalege from a banking
standpoint as IKIS been accorded
Fargo, Minot, Dickinson, Mandan,
Bismarck, etc. in other words to
allow Beach banks to act as reserve
agents for the banks in the smal
ler towns south of us, thereby nam
ing Beach as a reserve city.
The advantage of this lies chief
ly in allowing banks tributary to
Beach to carry their reserve in the
Beach banks, thereby keeping their
money nearer home, where it can
be utilized more quickly when need
ed. It also keeps such reserve mon
ey in the territory that these banks
serve, instead of having to keep
in other parts of the state, or
if

it
in
the Twin Cities.
It is very gratifying that this re
cognition of Beach's possibilities for
future growth should come at this
time and shows what a properly or
ganized Chamber with a determina
tion to work can do for the bet
terment of conditions generally, not
only in its environment, but in the
territory tributary to it.
This is but one of the many op
portunities for advancing the in
terests that the executive commit
tee of the Bench Chamber of Com
merce can take advantage of, and
should make residents of Beach and
Golden Valley County feel that tho
Chamber of Commerce will justify
its organization.
A continued interest is being man
ifested in the Chamber of Com
merce following the organisation
meeting of a short time ago at tho
opera house. New names are being
added, and sub-'antinl donations
made to place the Chamber on a
strong financial footing. If ycu aro
not already a member, get in touch
with the secretary at
once.
Every
man ia Beach should lend his in
fluence to the success of the organ
ization.
Secretary Ilayward of the Cham
ber of Commerce yesterday re
ceived a telegra.in from the Non
partisan League asking that body
if they would be willing to donate
the use of the opera house for a
mass convention on the afternoon
and evening of April 19th. A re
ply was immediately sent that tho
Chamber of Commerce would se
cure the opera house for that date.
This action will place Beach on the
map with six other cities of the
state, where similar conventions
will be held during the first week ia
April.
