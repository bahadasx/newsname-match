FIRST CLASH WITH VILLA
AND HIS BANDIT GANG IS
EXPEGTED MOMENTARILY
Border Towns Keyed to In
tense Pitch Awaiting
News of Action.
NEAR CHIEF'S HAUNTS
United States Troopers Be
lieved in Country of Out
law Sympathizers.
lcl Rio. Tex., March 17. One
hnndred and fifty Mexicans who or
ganized across the border from
I'into, 2H miles east of here, yes
terday, have moved inland, accord
ing to word reaching' here today.
American guards hare been re
doubled along that section of the
border. A detachment of United
Mates troops was sent to the
scene.
El Paso, Tex., March 17. Expecta
tion along the border was keyed to its
highest pitch today by the general be
lief that before nightfall the advance
guard of the American expeditionary
force would have entered Villa terri
tory in the mountains of the Casaa
Grandes region of Mexico.
While the censorship prevented any
official news of the whereabouts of the
American columns, reports brought by
Americans arriving from the interior
coupled with the calculations of men
thoroughly familiar with the territory
over which the expeditionary force
was passing made it reasonably certain
that the United States soldiers must
be close to the district where "Villa Is
believed to exercise his greatest Influ
ence and have the largest number of
sympathizers.
With the possibility that actual fight
ing with the Villistas might begin at
any moment interest was redoubled in
every Item of intelligence that threw
any light on the attitude of the Car
ranza adherents and more especially
on that of the five detachments of Car
ranza troops who are declared by the
officials of the de facto government to
be operating against Villa,
f arranza Consul Surly.
Andres Garcia, the Carranza consul
here, who is recognized as the closest
man to the first chief on the border,
refused to make any definite statement
as to what cooperation the American
officers might expect from the Mexi
can authorities. It was suggested to
him that the Carranza forces could
render valuable aid in supply guides,
aiding in the obtaining of forage and
in similar directions.
"The Americans have guides of their
own," he said, "who, I am sure, are
as good as any we could give them. I
feel equally certain that they have
better maps than any we have. The
soldiers of General Carranza are
marching against Villa, the American
soldiers are doing the same. That
seems to me to be cooperation and it
is all I have to say."
Rumors of disaffection and revolt
among the Carranza troops are plenti
ful here and there are people to spread
them, but all reliable information is
to the effect that thus far at least, the
Erst chi( f and his lieutenants have
maintained strict order. There seems
no question that a considerable section
of the Mexican people bitterly resent
the presence of American troops in
their country but as far as Is known
they have shown their hostility by no
overt act
The 2th Mexican suspected of Vil
llsta activities was arrested here last
night and placed with the 11 other for
mer generals and "cabinet ministers"
of Villa in Jail. Villista maneuvers in
El Paso seem to be mainly concerned
with the dissemination of sensational
reports reflecting upon the Carrsn-
zistas and intended to provoke ill-feel-!
oetween them ana tne Americans.

14 Carranza
Men Killed
in Explosion
Laredo, Texas, March 17. Fourteen
Carranza soldiers and 10 civilians
were killed in an explosion of a car
load of hand grenades and artillery
ammunition in the yards of the Na
tional railroad lines at Monterey,
Mexico, last Tuesday, according to
passengers reaching here today from
Monterey. The news was suppressed
by the Carranza authorities because
of the tension existing between the
United States and Mexico.
Several were injured. All the dead
and injured are Mexicans. Immedi
ately after the explosion a mountain
ous cloud of smoke spread over the
city and the cry, "the Americans have
arrived'." rang throughout the poorer
section. When the smoke cleared
away It was found that besides the 24
dead a hundred yards of railroad track
had been torn up, window panes shat
tered and other minor damage done
for a radius of a half mile.
The cause of the disaster must re
main a mystery, as everybody in the
immediate vicinity was killed.
The Carranza authorities suppress
ed publication of the news lest it stir
the peon classes to rise against Americans.

"Mr. Premier: As I explained to you

nowledge the receipt of your resigna

you the grief with which I receive it,
a grief which 13 shared by all your
colleagues in the ministry. I wish to
tell you how much I regret that the
state of your health should deprive
the government of services so precious
in the work of national defense. I
hope that, cured of the illness which
for the moment forces you to forego
active work, you may be able soon
again to take a prominent place in the
service of the country.
"Believe me, my dear general,
"Sincerely yours,
"ARISTIDE BRIAND."

LOSS OF LIFE
ONTOBANTIA
IS
Several Believed to Have
Perished Were Three
Americans Aboard.
Washington, March 17. Ameri
can, consuls in Holland have been '
instructed to investigate the sink
ing of the Dutch liner Tubantia
with Americans aboard, said to
have been torpedoed.
Consular agents at Gibraltar and
Lisbon haTe been instructed to in
vestigate the reported unsuccess
ful attempt to torpedo the French
liner Fatria.
London, March 17, '(1:15 a. m.) Ac
cording to latest reports there were
undoubtedly some casualties as a re
sult of the disaster to the Holland
Lloyds passenger steamship Tubantia
early yesterday morning, says a Reu
ter dispatch from Flushing. Men from
the crew were to have been landed by
Dutch torpedo boats say that the ves
sel was struck amidships in dense
darkness owing to a mist on the high
sea. The explosion was so terrific that
some of the life boats on deck were
shattered to pieces.
Two Dutch torpedo boats have
brought to Flushing a large number
of the survivors who had reached the
Xoordhinder Lightship in small boats.
Owing to the heavy mist and the rough
sea they were five hours in reaching
the lightship.
A Reuter dispatch from Amsterdam
says:
"Richard Schilling, the American
consul, who with his wife and daugh
ter arrived here this morning with oth
er survivors of the Tubantia, ex
pressed the opinion that the liner
struck a mine. The steamer, he said,
soon came to a standstill after being
struck and almost immediately heeled
over. The passengers and crew rushed
on deck, leaving all their belongings
behind and consequently lost all their
belongings.
"Mr. Schilling had heard that some
persons on board had lost their lives,
but the correspondent was unable to
obtain any confirmation of this."
It is now believed there was a small
number of lives lost in the sinking of
the Tubantia, either in the explosion
or in an accident which attended the
launching of a life boat. The steam
ship remained afloat several hours.
According to all reports there wag
no panic, everyone on board behaving
splendidly. The boats were launched
in their appointed order and the pas
sengers were all taken off first. The
rescue work was difficult on account
of the darkness, the heavy mist and
the rough sea.
The captain and part of the crew re
mained on the gradually sinking ship
for some time, the wireless operator
keeping up the work of guiding Dutch
vessels to the rescue. -

TODAY
An infantry attack after a heavy
bombardment against French posi
tions at Le Mort Homme, north
west of Verdun, resulted disas

hand to hand encounters have oc
curred. An official Italian state
ment says the Anstrians were re
pulsed, "leaving the ground cov
ered with dead."
On the Russian front only en
gagements between the patrols
have occurred.
Whether the Dutch passenger
steamer Tubantia which went
down yesterday off the Hook of
Holland struck a mine or was tor.
pedoed has not developed. Latest
reports of the disaster indicate
that there was some loss of life.
General Gallieni, French minis
ter of war, has resigned because of
ill health and General Charles
Roque has been appointed his suc
cessor. Important operations may he

Firm Contradiction of Re
ported Clash With Vil
, listas Is Made.
San Antonio, Texas, March 17.
The American expeditionary force
has had no casualties and has had
no clashes with Villistas, to date,
according to reports received to
day at Fort Sam Houston. There
has been no instance of sniping
reported.
Night marches probably will be
made by General John J. Pershing's
expeditionary forces in their search
for Francisco Villa, it was indicated
today at Fort Sam Houston. Night
marches would help to mystify Villa
as to the movements of the American
columns and would be easy of accom
plishment, it is said, because there Is
sufficient light for the purpose. Also
it would keep the men and horses
fresher. Days could be used for re
connoitering. Daylight marches make it Impos
sible to hide troop movements. Huge
clouds of dust indicate the marchers'
progress and are visible at great dis
tances. There will be no music for the sol
diers to enjoy .while on the march or
in camp, it has become known. Net a
single regimental band has been tak
en with the expedition, as it was de
sired not to handicap the expedition
with any useless apparatus.

Williams, American consul who quit
Torreon when trouble with Villa
broke out, is on his way here from
Laredo, where he arrived yesterday.

Bill Signed
byPresident
Washington, March 17 Presi
dent Wilson today signed the joint
congressional resolution authoriz
ing the increase of the standing
army to its full strength of ap
proximately 120,000 men.
The army increase bill was up for
consideration in the house today with
indications of its passage before to
morrow night. It is part of the ad
ministration's natural defense pro
gram and was prepared by the house
military committee, of which Repre
sentative Kay of Virginia, is chair
man, after months of investigation and
consideration. The house had paved
the way for consideration of the bill
by the adoption of a special rule under
which 10 hours of general debate will
be allowed after which it will come to
a vote on its passage. House leaders
were prepared to press for prompt ac
tion, although a vote may not be
reached before next week because of
many five-minute speeches after gen
eral debate is concluded. Night ses
sions will be held.
Chairman Hay, in charge of the bill,
was ready when the house assembled
at 11 o'clock today, to open the de
vate. While the house was debating its
bill, senate leaders were taking steps
for prompt consideration of the sen
ate army increase bill. Chairman
Chamberlain of the military commit
tee was prepared to insist upon its
prompt, consideration, even to displac
ing the waterpower bill unless a vote
is had rn it in a few days.
Forty speakers have asked for time,
republicans and democrats being
equally represented on the list. No
opponent of the general plan of pre
paredness had asked to be heard.
BERLIN APPROVES
VON TIRPITZ MOVE
Press of Germany Inclined to Feel Re
lieved at Resignation of Head
of Marine Affairs.
Berlin, March 17. German officials
repeat the statement that submarine
warfare will go on in the limits set
by the German memorandum to neu
tral powers of last month, but that the
demands of those who wished to
see the indiscriminate torpedoing of
"whatever comes in front of the tor
pedo tubes," to use the expression of
one of those who advocate this policy,
will not be fulfilled. This is also the
deduction which those acquainted with
the situation declare can be drawn
from the resignation of Admiral von
Tirpitz.
The Tages Zeitung, which has been
one of the strongest supporters of
Admiral Von Tirpitz, says that it is
"shaken by the news of the admiral's
resignation and does not at present
feel itself in a condition to make a
comment thereon."
The Morgenpost says:
"There will be universal regret that
circumstances made the retirement of
the grand admiral necessary. The
reasons for this and the inner rela
tions of affairs with one another can
not now be discussed, but it will be
regretted that there was no other way
out."
All the newspapers pay high com
pliment to the career of Admiral von
Tirpitz.
