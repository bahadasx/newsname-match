Knoxville's First
Trade
Trip
The Knoxville Board of Com
merce is receiving enthusiastic
letters daily from the different
Boards of Commerce of the towns
and cities to be visited on their
First Trade Trip, assuring them
of their hearty co-operation in
making this trip the decided suc
cess the Knoxville organization
desires it to be. While this is to
the first trip that Knoxville has
ever made of this kind, neither
pains nor expense are being spar
ed to make it a success in every
way.
She purpose of the trip is not
altogether for business purposes,
or for selling goods, but rather
to meet thebeopleof the various
towns from whom they buy goods
and to who they sell goods, and
to bring them into a closer rela
;! iship with each other.
In several of the larger towns
and cities where the ' Sperial"
is to stop for some length of time,
preparations are being made to
entertain the visitors in man
ways; while in the smaller towns
where the length of stay will not
permit of extensive entertain
ment, other forms will be pro
vided. The special will consist of eight
all-steel Pullman cars, including
two dining cars and one combi
nation baggage and refreshment
car.
The train will carry over 100
of Knoxville's leading business
and professional men and manu
facturers on board. Besides
these, there will be a large brass
band to help make merry when
the visitors arrive in the various
towns and cities.
Each member of the party will
wear a white hat and carry a
striped umbrella in addition to
wearing the regular badge.
Pike Road Bond Money
Much has been said in regard
to the way the funds have been
spent, and for what purpose they
have been spent. I want to make
a statement as to the amount of
this fund that has been paid out.
Up to the present date there
has been paid out of the fund for
which bonds were sold, to the
amount of $4286.20, this has
been paid for the engineering
and incidental expenses for the
benefit of tho road.
I believe that it is due the tax
payers of the county that I give
this information. It is here for
any one to see. Your servant,

JUDGE SAMPSON
HERE SUNDAY
Attended 65th Wedding
Anniversary of Parents.
Three Weeks More of
Court at Williamsburg.
Among those in attendance at
the celebration of the sixty-fifth
wedding anniversary of Mr. and
Mrs. Joseph Sampson Saturday,
was Circuit Judge F. D. Samp
son, who is holding court at Wil
liamsburg. There are three weeks
more of the Whitley term of
court and in the absence of the
regular Judge from the bench,
H. C. Gillis, by agreement of
party litigants, consented to act
as special Judge, thus affording
Judge Sampson an opportunity
to be present at the very noted
and unusual celebration, that of
a sixty-fifth anniversary of the
marriage of his parents.
The present term of court at
Williamsburg is six weeks in
length and nearly all of that
time is being consumed in trying
civil cases and clearing up the
docket. There were no import
ant felony cases at this term ex
cept one brought from Pulaski
county, and fewer misdemeanor
cases than usual. Judge Samp
son is fast getting the would-be
criminals and law violators to
see the error of their ways by
his firm stand for law and order.
The good people of thi? district
are proud of the record he has
made, while on the bench, in the
suppression of crime. Judge
Sampson is popular and in the
coming August primary for the
Republican nomination forjudge
of the Court of Appeals he looks
l.ke a winner.
Spelling Bee
The last of a Series of a spell
ing Bee given under the auspices
ot the Ladies Aid M. E. Church
and Barbourville High School'
Band, was given Tuesday even
ing March 14th at the Court
House. The Captains were Mrs.
lohn W. Hughes and Mr. S. T.
Steele of this city. A large line
)f spellers were soon chosen, and
very seat in the large room was
taken by spectators. The spell
ing was lively from start to fin
ish, the "blue back" being used
exclusive, beginning with the
.vords baker, shady, lady, tidy
&c including horse-back abase
ment and all those hard pages
-hat have been studied by many
m old time youngster. The line
oegan to grow shorter as many
a good speller forgot just exactly
now he used to spell then andto
cake a seat. The contest grow
more interesting and the wordi
more difficult until only a few
spellers were on the floor at clos
ing time. Mrs. Hughes' side
one and Mr.. Steele s side three.
The book used from which to
pronounce was owned by Franc
es M. Rees, (who is quite a not
ed speller) and is reported as
being the oldest copy io the coun
ty and perhaps in the State.
The Ladies desire to thank the
town people far their co-opera
tion and liberal patronage.
