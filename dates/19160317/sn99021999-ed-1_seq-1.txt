devious ways. The facts were as fol

troops fell In at their camp In full march

11 and was answered by a shout from
tho men. Then the column started out
Cowboys off the ranges, enrolled as
scouts, and cavalry led the way. Two In
fantry regiments, some field artillery
and a waaon train came after, "'he de
parture of the force was unmarked by
a slnglo dramatic detail. It waa as bus
iness like as a practice march. A long
nasy lino of alkali dust, standing out
against the dull white of the plains and
the biasing light of the sun marked their
progress toward the border, as viewed
from a hill above the village.

General Pershing accompanied the foroe
as far at the border, but he came back
later In the afternoon and took another
direction, to the flank with a pait of
the troops. ,
The troops taking part In the movement
numbered about 6,000 and were composed
of the Thirteenth cavalry, the Blxth and
Sixteenth Infantry and other details that
bad been encamped here.
During the preceding night it is said
that Colonel Slocum met Colonel Davit i
of the Mexicans, ,who promised that no
resistance would us made to croialng the
border. At any rate, there was no re
sistance made, but the entire Uevcii
population In Palomas, soldiers and civil
