PIONEER FARMER
DIES SUDDENLY
Joseph Schmidt, the Widely
Known Greencreek Farmer,
Falls Victim to Meningitis
Last Monday.
This community, as well as ad
joining communities, was greatly
shocked Monday afternoon when
the death of Joseph Schmidt, one
of Idaho county's most prominent
and prosperous farmers, was an
nounced. The death came quite
suddenly, the deceased having
eaten supper with his family Sat
urday evening and was taken ill
at an early hour Sunday morning.
Dr. Turner was summoned and
Dr. Shinnick was called in con
sultation. They at once diagnosed
the case as an infection of the
middle ear, which had spread
to the mastoid cells back
of the ear and that an immediate
operation was necessary and that
even this was a last resort. Prep
arations for the operation were
made and the skull was trephined
but it was found that the accum
ulation of pus had broken through
into the cerebral cavity and men
ingitis developed, causing death
Monday afternoon.
Joseph Schmidt was born in
Greencreek. Illinois, and was 52
years of age at the time of his
death. He was married at that
place to Miss Bernadina Nuxoll
and shortly afterward moved to
Idaho. For several years they
resided on a - farm southeast of
this place, moving from there to
the homestead at Greencreek
s ome eighteen years ago, where
they have lived continuously since
that time. To this union ten
children were born, all of whom
are still living. Being a first class
farmer and frugal he built up one
of the finest farm homes in the
county and gradually accumula
ted other land and property until
he became one of the wealthiest
farmers in the county. But
wealth and success in life did not
make Joseph Schmidt proud or
vain and he was always consider
ed one of the substantial men of
his community, the friend of ev
eryone and the man on whom to
call when in need of advice or
assistance in time of trouble. A
thorough Christian, he lived his
life each day as nearly as possible
according to the teachings of his
faith and was recognized by all
as one in whom absolute depend
ence could be placed at all times.
The deceased had resided in
Idaho 28 years to a day when he
died and his death is recognized
as a material loss to the entire
section in which he is best known.
He leaves to mourn his loss a
widow, ten children, one brother
in Illinois, a half-brother, John
Uhlorn of Ferdinand, many rela
tives and countless friends.
The funeral was held Wednes
day morning from the Catholic
church at Greencreek, interment
being made in the cemetery at
that place. Forty teams compos
ed the procession that followed
the remains to their last resting
place, bearing silent testimonial
to the deep esteem in which the
deceased was held.
The grief of the stricken family
and relatives may be in part as
suaged by the knowledge that a
good man has gone to his just
reward and that earth was bet
ter for his presence here.
Frank W. Nuxcll returned last
night from his trip to Montana.
W. P. Greenough, father of
our local attorney and pest mas
ter, ariived in the city last week
from Oklahoma and will make
his home here with his son.

Among The Sick
Mrs. N. G. Bartlett is reported
quite ill this week with pneu
monia.
John Uhlorn is reported quite
ill with pneumonia at his home
near Ferdinand.
Mrs. B. L. Hussman, who has
been on the sick list for the past
couple of weeks, is reported
much improyed at this writing.
Little George Funke got two
fingers badly mashed in the cel
lar door Monday morning and the
members had to be dressed by
Dr. Shinnick.
Mrs. Carl Hermes is quite ill
at her home east of Ferdinand.
She has been bedfast for the past
eight weeks and is recovering
very slowly.
Mrs. Anton Haener, formerly
Miss Barbara Nau, was taken to
Lewiston Monday from Ferdi
nand and underwent an opera
tion there Tuesday, Dr. Shinnick
assisting with the operation. The
patient is doing nicely and will
soon be able to return home.
R. S. Curless was kicked in the
side of the face by one of his
horses Saturday and was render
ed unconscious for some time.
Quite a gash was cut in his face
by the horse's hoof. Dr. Orr
dressed the wound and Riley is
able to be around again but his
features are still quite tender.
The little 9-year old daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Oldham
was taken to Lewiston Wednes
day by Dr. Orr and operated on
for appendicitis at the St. Joseph
hospital. The child's appendix
had bursted before the operation
and, while she stood the opera
tion nicely, peritonitis has devel
oped and her condition is said to
be critical.
Will Connect With Bell Line
E. E. Crandall, district mana
ger for the Bell telephone com
pany, was in the city several days
this week from Spokane and on
Tuesday met with the directors
of the Greencreek telephone com
pany and succeeded in getting
that company to connect its line
with the Bell system at this place.
The new line will be completed
into the city in about six weeks
and will serve some thirty farm
ers of that section. The line is
one of the best to be erected by
farmers in this county and will
cost about $2,300 when com
pleted. It will be a valuable
feeder to the Bell system on the
prairie.
A. H. Nau and family were
Westlake visitors yesterday.
Some of the farmers in the
Greencreek and Winona country
started plowing this week. The
ground is still pretty wet, how
ever, and snow banks are numer
ous in many fields.
E. M. Becker, S. A. Terry and
J. E. O'Leary, of Lewiston, V.
Knapp, of Grangeville, and M.
R. Hibbaed, of Spokane, were
numbered among the traveling
salesmen in the city Monday.
Will Rooke came up Tuesday
evening from Lewiston, where
he had been at his son's bedside
for several days, and left Wed
nesday for his home across the
river. He said Vance was pro
nounced out of danger Tuesday
morning but will remain in the
hospital for three or four weeks
more. He had a very bad gan
grenous condition of the appendix
and his condition was quite seri
ous for several days after the
operation. However, his perfect
health pulled him through in good
shape and he will soon be as well
as ever. Will speaks very highly
of the Sisters at the hospital and
of Dr. Nourse, who performed
the operation.

Villa Raids American Town—
U. S. Troops Now in Mexico
The United States is at last in
volved in warfare with Mexico,
or at least, has invaded that coun
try to avenge the murder of six
teen American citizens. On
March 9th Francisco Villa, the
outlawed Mexican bandit, raided
the town of Columbus, New Mex
ico, with 1500 of his followers
and killed sixteen residents of
the town and wounded many
others, setting the town on fire
and escaping back across the
border, but not until more than
a hundred of his men had paid
the penalty and left their bodies
on American soil. Villa and his
band sneaked into Coldmbus in
the night and were not discover
ed until seen by one of the soldiers
on guard. He fired on the in
truders and this started the fray,
the outlaws shooting down the
citizens as they came from their
houses. Several of the army of
ficers' quarters were riddled with
Mexican bullets, having been
pointed out by Mexican residents
of the town, and in the meantime
others poured oil onto buildings
and fired them, shooting the peo
ple down as'they fled from the
flames.
At the first alarm the small
bunch of troops quartered in the
town rushed to arms and within
a few minutes were taking dead
ly toll from the invaders, being
ably assisted by many of the citi
zens who had barricaded them
selves in their homes and fought
off the enemy to the best of their
ability. The defense put up by
More Real Estate Changes
Joseph Leischner completed a
deal this week for the sale of his
fine 172-acre farm six miles east
of town to Carl Hermes for $12,
000, or nearly $70 an acre. Mr.
Leischner purchased the place
some eight years ago and has
doubled his money on the increase
in the value of the land. The
place is well improved and will
make the new owner an ideal
home. Mr. Leischner has not
decided where he will go but,
after holding a sale of his per
sonal property next week, will
probably stop with his brother
north of Grangeville for a short
time until he decides on a new
location. He will perhaps seek
a lower altitude in hopes of bene
fiting his health. Mr. Hermes,
who is residing on the old S. E.
Smith farm northeast of town at
present, will move onto his new
farm as soon as possible in order
to put the place in crop this
spring.
A deal was partly consummated
recently whereby Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph Schmidt, of Greencreek,
sold their 160-acre farm south
east of this place to F. J. Kolbeck
for a price of $85 an acre. The
place lies just across the road
from the Kolbeck farm and has
been farmed by Mike Wirrer for
the past several years. It is a
valuable acquisition to the Kol
beck farm, as is evidenced by
the price paid for it.
Mrs. H. J. Smith purchased a
lone apple tree the first of the
week from J. V. Nash and got
two lots in the Aichlmayr addi
tion thrown in for good measure
on the deal. The tree and the
ground which it controls is lo
cated just north of the Betz resi
dence in the Aichlmayr addition
and it is the intention of Dr. and
Mrs. Smith to build themselves a
home "in the shade of the lone
apple tree" in the immediate
future. • -v -

the citizens and troops proved
more than the Villa forces could
stand and they soon fled back
across the border, being hotly
pursued by small detachments of
mounted cavalry. The Mexicans
are reported to have made a
stand about fifteen miles from
the border and are said to have
about 2500 to 3000 soldiers.
General Funston has been placed
in command of the troops on the
border and has sent 7,500 men
across the line to hunt down and
capture Villa and his forces, the
instructions being to bring them
in dead or alive. News from the
front is very meager but the in
tention is to rush matters to the
utmost in order to make the cam
paign as short as possible. Cap
turing the bandits in their own
country may prove difficult but
the government is backing the
invading forces to the limit and
there will be no half hearted
measures in dealing with the
marauders.
In the meantime large forces
of infantry are being quartered
along the border to prevent rep
etitions of the Columbus affair
and to give greater freedom to
the calvary forces. The flying
squadron will also be used exten
sively in locating the Villa forces
and keeping our troops posted as
to their movements.
It is not believed the Mexicans
generally will oppose the invasion
by our troops for the capture of
Villa and the campaign should
prove of short duration.
