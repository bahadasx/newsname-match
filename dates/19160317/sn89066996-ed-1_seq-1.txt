EXPERT OPINION ON
SEWER FOR THIS CITY
INDORSE PRESIDENT
WILSON'S WISE POLICIES
Pure Milk
Better Babies
The modern mother and house-wife
realizes that one of the most impor
tant items of the daily food supply is
milk, and also that it is the most pro
lific of disease.
The most scrupulous care, the most
immaculate cleanliness and intelligent
effort are necessary for the success
ful operation of a dairy; but all these
are unavailing if the source is infect- J
ed. And so subtle is the action of di
lease in cattle, that frequently only
scientific tests will disclose its presence.
The women of Farmington, there
fare, have been greatly pleased at the
announcement of the coming of Dr. f
Lucky, State Inspector of Cattle, who
it is said, will inspect the herds of our
focal dairies. There can be no ques
tion as to the necessity for this in-1
spection, and the club women have
upited their efforts to further the
cause of Better Babies and Public I
Health, by encouraging the interest j
and co-operation of the owners of i
these herds.
As the hot days come, an assured
pure milk supply will add a sense of
peace and security which the mothers
of our community have not known in
former years.

In our campaign for Better Babies
the first thing to consider is the food
f the infant. We are told that for
the first six or nine months the baby
should have nothing but milk, and un
til the child is three years old, milk
should constitute a large part of its
diet.
It is, therefore, of the utmost im
portance to the community, no less
than to the family, that the milk sup
ply should be unquestionable. Von
Behring and other world-authorities
state that consumption in grown peo
ple starts as glandular tuberculosis
in childhood. This is traced direct
ly to the milk of tubercular cows sold
by dairymen, who say they did not
know their cows were diseased. There
is no excuse for ignorance, as it has
been printed and re-printed until it is

a matter of common information, that
a diseased cow WILL infect the chil
dren to whom the milk is fed. Let
us, as a community, take a stand in
this matter and see that in our work
for Better Babies we have a milk sup
ply that is unimpeachable.
Babes in Fairyland
The presentation of the above play
drew a crowded house to the Monarch
Theatre Friday evening, and that ev
eryone present was thoroughly sat
isfied and pleased with the manner in
which the delightful performance was
presented was abundantly testified
throughout the whole program. The
"Babes" proved their ability to de
light an audience with the splendid
rendition of the many characters, all
of which were so admirably taken,
thus showing that they are true de
scendants of their sires.
There were about fifty little ones in
the presentation, ranging from wee
tots to children of ten years of age,
and the manner in which all of
them performed their parts was
practically perfect. It not only in
dicated most careful and painstaking
training of the little performers, but
unusual natural ability as well. The
members of the Ladies' Aid of the
Christian Church, who had charge of
the performance, are also entitled to
much praise for the excellent train
ing, discerning selection, and splendid
staging of the play, which presented
the "Babes" in this highly pleasing
operetta.
Each performer is entitled to per
sonal mention for the manner in
which the whole performed their part,
but space will not permit of such de
tail, so The Times must conclude its
mention with the statement that we
do not believe it possible for any
"Bunch of Babies" to present a more
pleasing performance than was that
of "Babes in Fairyland" at the Mon
arch last Friday evening.

Dr. Hemenway Says Farmington is
Ideally Situated as to Sanitation,
But That There is Urgent Need
of Underground Sewerage
We have had something to say re
cently of the necessity and desirabil
ity of a sewerage system for Farm
ington, and we have greatly enjoyed
a talk this week along this line of
thought with one who is eminently
equipped to give a scientific opinion.
We have had in our midst the past
week Dr. Henry B. Hemenway of
Evansville, 111. The Doctor came here
to see his daughter, Mrs. Ruth Hem
enway Shaw, who, while the guest of
Mrs. Frank Weber, was unfortunately
taken sick.
Dr. Hemenway is a distinguished
member of the American Public
Health Association and a number of
other socities having to do with the
science of health. He has made a
life-long study of this science and has
had extensive experience in sanitary
inspection at Kalamazoo, Michigan,
where he was a member of the State
Board of Health, and at other places.
He is a recognized authority cn san
itation and other phases of the science
of health. His book, "The Legal
Principle of Public Health Adminis
tration," is the principal legal author
ity on such matters and has high
government recognition. "The Es
sentials of Veterinarian Law," is an
other of his works that is classed
among the standard authorities, and
another book of his, "American Pub
lic Heakh Protection", is just off the
press.
In talking with us on the subject of
sanitation, Dr. Hemenway said that
"Farmington is naturally an ideal
place from a sanitary point of view.
It can easily be made more attrac
tive," said he, "so that St. Louis peo
ple will be drawn here on account of
the health of the location as well as
its beauty."
"Farmington has a fine water sup- j
Adds $15,000,000
to Miners Wages
After a debate lasting nearly six
hours, the interstate joint conference
of miners and operators from the
soft-coal fields of Western Pennsylva
nia, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, rep
resenting nearly 200,000 mine workers,
today adopted the new wa.o con
tract agreed upon by the subcom
mittee of employers and employes.
The agreement will increase the in
come of the mine workers in those
States about $15,000,000 during the
two-year period the contract is to run.
Mine Disaster
A premature explosion in the Fed
eral mines at Flat River early Sun
day morning killed a machine man
named Beasley, fatally wounding an
other machine man, named Dick New
man, who died before medical aid
reached him, and severely wounding
three shovelers, all of whom are yet
living, though frightfully maimed.
The wounded men are all foreigners.
Both dead men were Americans.
Dick Newman leaves a wife and
several children to mourn their loss.
It is such calamities as this that re
mind us that there is something ap
parently lacking in tho safeguarding
of the lives of miners, and yet there
is a certain amount of carelessness on
the part of the workers themselves,
brought on largely by the sameness
of their work, that allows their sens
es to become somewhat blunted to
the dangers of their avocation.
"Eternal vigilence" should be their
watchword, and yet it seems impossi
ble that some do not occasionally for
get. CHANGE IN MAIL SERVICE
Mail that has been leaving the
Farmington Post Office at 6:33 p. m.,
has been ordered discontinued, be
ginning March 17. Mail now leaves
at 5:52 a. m., and all mail deposited
in the Farmington Post Office up to
3:30 p. m. will go out for St. Louis in
this mail.
You should paste this notice in
your hat.or some convenient place, for
reference.
ply," said he, "which should never
cause any problem in health to con
front us, being apparently inexhaust
ible and free from possible contamin
ation. It should be matched by a
suitable sewerage system, especially
for the center of the town. Open
ditches are an offense, and are sure
to breed mosquitoes. We know now
that malaria can only be contracted
as the result of the bite of an infect
ed anopheles mosquito. Typhoid fe
ver, in a town like this, is chiefly
spread by flies, which carry the germs
from privies or open sewers to ar
ticles of food."
"The problems of sewerage for
Farmington," remarked the Doctor,
"should not be difficult, and the gen
eral plans should be made for the en
tire city before any sewers are laid,
so that the work may be permanent
and systematically carried on. While
cess pools in large lots may not be
sources of danger, in the more thick
ly settled sections they should not be
permitted."
Taking up another line of thought,
Dr. Hemenway said that "as a mat
ter of economy medical inspection of
school children should be established,
and accurate records kept of such in
spection. The general inspection,
h6Wever," said he, "need not be made
by physicians in general practice, but
the school should have a competent
graduate nurse to make such examin
ations, referring special cases to the
family physician."
We were much interested and high
ly enjoyed our talks with Dr. Hemen
way, whose social qualities are as
agreeable as his conversation is en
tertaining and instructive. He and his
daughter, Mrs. Shaw, who we are
pleased to know has recovered from
her indisposition, leave for their home
in Illinois today.
"Blowing" Well
Foretells Storms
C. V. Seger of near Blackwell, one
of the. county's well-known and most
substantial citizens, was a caller at
The Times office Tuesday and had his
name enrolled among The Times' read
ers. In the course of conversation
we discovered that Mr. Seger has a
nhenominal well on his place. In ap
pearance it is like the ordinary wells
to be found on so many farms, though
a little deeper than the average, be
ing about 130 feet deep. But this well
is a regular weather barometer and
foretells a storm wiht perfect accu
racy. He calls it a "blowing" well
from the fact that at times it emits
a blowing sound like wind passing
through a tunnel, and this blowing
sound is the sure pressage of a storm
of rain, snow or wind. Sometimes the
"blowing" will continue for a couple
of days, and a two-days' storm is
sure to follow. When he left home
last Monday it was a beautiful, bright,
balmy day, and his wife told him
that he better get back before Tues
day night, for the well was "blowing"
and there would be a storm. He was
here Tuesday afternoon, and sure
enough the storm was on, cold, disa
greeable and snowy. Who can ac
count for this phenomenon ?

unanimously adopted:
Resolved, 1. That we, the Democrats
of St. Francois County, in delegated

heartily indorse the administration
of our National affairs under the able
and courageous leadership of our
PreMdoiirrfhe Hen. Woodrow Wilson,

The Republicans held their Coun

River to elect delegates to their State
Convention where the "big four" del
egates to their National Convention
are chosen, and to their Congression
al District Convention which meets at
DeSoto to elect their district dele
gates to the National Convention.
There was reputed to be some lit
tle opposing sentiment among the lo
cal leaders to State Committeeman
Politte Elvins, and there was a little
quiet manuvering, we understand, to
put one over on him, but Politte is
not one of the kind to be found nap
ping on occasions of that kind, so the
outcome was that the name of Politte
Elvins looms up large as one of the
county delegates to the State Con
vention. The list of delegates to the
State Convention follows: E. A. Ro

J. B. Burks, chairman of the com
mittee on resolutions, in presenting
them to the convention, made a stir

hearty applause and commendation.
B. II. Marbury was then called on
for a speech, and in his forceful and
impassioned manner, electrified the
convention with one of the best polit
ical addresses ever delivered here,
and his auditors showed by frequent
demonstrations of applause their ap
preciation of his merits as a speaker.

before, and lost that opportunity of
presenting the claims of "the next
