Four Stories
Bones Broken
Several months ago while work
ing oir the municipal and auditor
ium building at Galveston, Texas,
Leonard Steele, of Paris, fell
four stories to the street below,
when a workman above him
dropped a piece of timber which
struck Steele on the head. While
no bones were broken, he was
unconscious for twelve hours or
more, and has not yet completely
recovered from the fall.
Steele returned home a few
days ago after being in a hospital
for several months. He expects
to return to the West when he
has recovered. His back was
badly hurt by the fall. He is a
son of James Steele, of this city.
It is regarded as miraculous that

President Douthit and Secretary
. Bruce Issue Call At Request
Of, Directors
At the request of u number of
the directors President H. B.
Douthit and Secretary H. L.
Bruce have issued a call for a
meeting of the stockholders of
the Henry County Fair Associa
tion to be held at the courthouse
Saturday afternoon, March 25,
at 1 o'clock, the purpose of the
meeting, according to the call, is
to reconsider the action taken at
the recent meeting in requiring
that no entrance fees be charged
on exhibits and to transact "any
other business that may properly
come before said meeting."
Report has' it that ap effort
will be made to take the limit of
$500 off the speed ring depart
ment and to allow horses' from
other counties and states to
enter.
. At the recent meeting a resolu
tion offered by" E". B; McGehee'
was adopted, which placed a
limit of $500 on the speed ring,
and declared that this and all
other departments should be
open to Henry county horses,
live stock, farm products, etc.,
only.
The resolution also removed
all entrance fees. There was
considerable opposition to this
change, although a good majority
of the stock was voted favorably,
and it is believed an effort will
bo made at the meeting Satur
day week to open all competition
to the world, as well as to charge
entrance fee3 on exhibits.
The meeting will probably be
held in the county court room
and a large number of the share
holders wili likely be precent in

Many Express Opinion
That People Would
Vote Issue of $500,
000 For Highway
Building In Henry
County.
More headway is being gained
every day by the movement for
a half million dollar bond issue
for the construction of roads in
Henry county, and the opinion
is being freely expressed that if
the county court will submit the
proposition to the people for a
vote the verdict will be in favor
of the bond issue.
Monday was the opening day
of the March term of circuit
court, and a large crowd was in
Paris. On every hand farmers
could be heard to say that a bond
issue was the only remedy for
the bad road conditions that
have existed all winter.
"The difference betweon the
mud tax and the pike tax,." de
clared one gentleman, "is that
in the case of the mud tax you
have t;o die to stop the payments,
while in the case of the pike tax
you pay up in twenty years and
have the roads to enjoy 'for the
remainder lof vour life." ,
Friends of the proposed bond
issue are seeing the members of
the county court, and a number
of the justices have already
stated their intention of voting
to submit the question to the
people, it is said.
It is more than two weeks
until the meeting ctf the next
session of the county court and
che good roads advocates will
not be idle during that time.
If the court submits the
luestion to a vote of the people,
che fight will be made for the
bond issue, and there is a grow
ing impression that it will carry.
Henry county people are deter
mined to have better roads, and
see no way to get them except
by voting a bond issue.
There is little opposition to
making the bond issue $500,000.
The needed road work could not
be done on less than that amount,
it is said.
"Let the people decide," is
getting to be a popular expres
sion in regard to the proposed
bond issue, and in view of the
strong support that the move
ment has it is not regarded as at
all Drobable that the court will
refuse to submit the question.
COUNTY TEACHERS TO MEET
