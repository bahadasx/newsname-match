Now 50 Families There
Yesterday morning C. L. Heist, W.
B. Hogan, Leo G. Joyce and Ernest
A. Pickering were in Cedar City on
their way home from Parowan, where
they hud been to make final proof on
their respective homesteads at Heist,
, this county. '
Seen by n representative of The
Record, they talked enthusiastically
and entertainingly about conditions in
their locality.
Already Has Fifty Families.
"H ," Nada is locuted on the east side of
I tho tracks of the Salt Lake Route,
and about mid-way between Lund and
J Nada. It has a rapidly increasing
population, comprising at the present
' Z time about 50 families. The home-
f stcuders reside on their respectivo
) farms, for the most part, so that the
H, town is very much scattered, but a
lot of good homes arc being built and
it permanent improvements made. Good
Jjj, water for culinary purposes as wejl as
, " for home gardens is procured at a
-' depth of from 50 to 150 feet, and
fev nearly all the settlers are putting
' F down wells. The subterranean sup-
ply of water seems to be well nigh
jT " ' jg, InoxhaustJblo, as pumping does not
fa of the water ih their wells.
j, t Large Acreage Will be .Cropped.
$ The land in this locality is a sandy
, loam, well adapted to the production
j " of arid wheat and other dry land
v crops, and a large acreage was seed-
!! ed to various crops last fall. Heist
Brothers (for whom the place was
named) & Hogan, have 3,000 acres
J planted, 500 acres of which is in dry
land wheat. Various other settlers
of the loculity have unother 3,000
I acres planted, and if the rabbits do
' not interfere, they feel confident of
raising some good crops,
t Two Large Tractors are Busy.
Two large gasolino tractors, besides
14 head of horses, are being used on
T the farm of tho company, Heist Bros.
& Hogan, and a large acreage is fast
J being brought under tho plow. They
' predict that in a very short time it
i will bo unnecessary for Iron county
I to import any bread stuff, but that on
- , tho contrary wo will be shipping a
largo quantity out of tho county each
r year.
Road to Hamblin Valley.
" i .One of Iho most important improve
ments that arc under way in that lo-
j cality at present is a road from the
Escalanto valley in which Heist is
, . situated directly north for a distance
of about seven miles into the Hamblin
valley, which is also in this county
f and is being rapidly settled up. Tho
people arc determined that tho road
I shall be built, oven if they havo to do
.the entire work themselves, but they
feel that they are entitled to some aid
" from tho county, and will likely pc-
!" tition tho commissioners at their next
j meeting. With the exception of about
f. a mile, the road will all be easy of
t construction, and if they can get the,
j uso of tho county grader they havo
", tractors and can soon build tho grade.
' I , For about a milo tho road would bo
along tho hillside, necessitating a lit-
, fe tie dugway, but the rocks that would
fr. be encountered aro small and loose,
J f so that there would be practically no
1 blasting to do.
s The representatives from there we
h have above referred to aro not at all

THEE MEMBERS ON THE
ALL STATE STAR TEAM
Big Demonstration in Honor of (he
Victors on Their Return Home
Last Wednesday.
There was much enthusiasm and
rejoicing in Cedar City when it wns
learned last Monday night that the
basket ball team of the Branch Agri
cultural College of this city had won
tho championship in the state tourna
ment held this year at Brigham City,
The cnthusinsm was not confined to
the school, either, but was shared by
the townspeople generally as well. It
is uri honor that is fully appreciated.
When the victorious players returned
home last Wednesday, they word met
and escorted into town by auto
mobiles, amid tho sounding of whist
les and the honking of horns. In the
evening the students of the school all
formed in a long procession, including
the band, and marched through the
business section bearing u coffin in
scribed "Lehi." Aftor parading the
streets for a short time they drew up
and formed a circle on Main street
just below the tabernacle, where goods
boxes were brought, the coffin mounted
on them and a match applied. The
corpse was cremated while stirring
speeches and school songs and yells
were participated in.
The student body then marched

Winning of the Contest.
Tho following account of the finish
of the tournament, which is said to
be the most accurate of any published,
is taken from the Suit Lake Tribune
of March 14th:
With a few exhibition games and
the national basketball tournament in
Chicago, the hoop game will be over
before next week appears.
The Branch Agricultural College
five, which won the state high school
title, has broken training for the year,
although it was at first thought that
tho B. A. C. boys would play at Lo
gan, but as the boys were showing
the effects of tho strenuous contests,
Conch Jack Christensen thought best
to call off the Aggio game and end
tho season with a victory.
Jack Christensen will get a grand
reception when ho returns to Cedar
City tomorrow, and he deserves it, for
he is the first conch to take the state
title to southern Utah, and then to a
school which was never regarded as
formidable before Jack took the reins.
The tournament should havo been
.decided in three days, but the Cedar
boys' loss on the first night necessi
tated the extra gume. In the lust
three nights the B. A. C. showed its
superiority, although the final con
test with Lehi wns u poor exhibition.
B. A. C. Has Grent Bunch.
Tho B. A. C. is not accustomed to
playing on any 'floor but a rough one,
so when tho boys hit tho smooth Box
elder floor they had some difficulty.
Coach Christensen thinks that had
his boys beon able to play their game
on a "dead" floor tho margins would
not have been so close.
Coach Christensen's boys have trav
elled the. most of any high school five
in tho state, and when they return to
day and tomorrow thoy will take up
school work whore thoy loft off two
weeks ago.
In the recent tourney every player
on the B. A. C. team was considered
on tho all state team. Every man was
a strong player in his position, and
with the exception of tho first game
with Lehi shone briliantly.
Despito much talk that the West
high school wojld play tho B, A. C,
Coach Christensen said his boys would
not play, inasmuch ns the Panthers
were no longer in the association and
tho boys were very eager to break
training.
Griffin, Woodard, Bunker and Es
plin left Salt Lake yesterday in nn
automobile and wil reach Cedar City
toduy. Hansen, Thorley and Coach
Christonson will get homo about tho
samo timo. A grand celebration Ms
planned for th players.
Jcppson High Scorer.
During tho first three nights' play
Branch Agricultural College led in tho
scoring, with Lehi second. Lehi com
mitted the most fouls, with'Boxclder
second.
Jeppson of Boxcldcr wns first in in
dividual field goal scoring, with eleven
while three were tied for second.
Hansen of B. A. C, Griffin of B. A.
C, and Wanlcss of Lehi each made
ten. Hnnscn played a guard, so his
record seems nil tho more remark
able. Griffin led the centers.
Croft of Tooele was tho best foul
pitcher. Woodard of B. A. C. was not
among the big scorers, but he showed
himself to be a mighty valuable man
with his great floor work, not being
excelled by any player. Croft and
Woodard appeared to many to be the
best forwards in the tourney. Grif
fin, the B. A. C. center, was tho se
lection for center, while Jensen, Box
elder, Hansen and Thorley, B, A. C,
and Taylor, Lehi, were four guards
who did greot work at the defense po
sitions. The officiating of Male Watson and
Tommy Fitzpatrick pleased oil the
spectators und the couches suve one.

James Hunt Dies in this City as Re
sult of Appendicitis Opera
tion Delayed Too Long.
James Hunt of Enterprise died in
Cedar City yesterday morning of per
itonitis, and obstruction of the bowel,
complicating appendicitis. The young
man took ill Thursday laRt at Modena
of appendicitis, but as he had
weathered .several other attacks. h.e
thought "he could- do -it again,. Ho
suffered intensely until the following
Tuesday, when Drs. McGregor of St.
George and Macfarlane of this place
were consulted. When the 'latter
reached the sick man his condition
was found to be so serious that even
operation offored remote chanco of
saving him. At the request of the
rolutives, however, he was brought to
Cedar City, where ho was operated
thnt night
When the ubdomen wns opened it
was apparent from the extenslvo per
itonitis and gangrene that nothing
conld be done further than drainage
for temporary relief. The unfortu
nate man was made us comfortable
as possible until death relieved him,
twenty-four hours later.
From his physicians wo leam that
Mr. Hunt was an unmarried man 29
years of age. Ho camo to Enterprise
only two months ago from Idaho to
make his home. It is unfortunate
that help could not have been gotten
sooner, for ho was an examplary
young man of the typo that Enter
prise or uny other town can ill afford
to lose.

SAINTS REPORT GOOD TIME
AT STAKE CONFERENCE
A most excellent time is reported at
the recent quarterly Btako conference
held in Parowan, by the saints who
were in attendance at the meetings
from this pluce, of which there was a
goodly number.
To hnvo the president of tho Church
in attendance at sjtako conferences is
becoming quite a rare thing, and is
an honor which tho people of this
stako appreciated very much. The
attendance at the meetings was phe
nomenal, and a great many were de
nied tho privilege of attending some
of tho sessions because of a lack of
room.
Automobiles were busy on tho road
between Cedar City and Parowan all
during tho conference, and tho attend
ance from this place broke all records
of tho past. Even at this more would
have gone if car accommodations had
bcon available.

BEHINDJHE FAIR
Committee Investigating Site
and Preparing Plans for

F. W. MIDDLETON FOR
COUNTY COMMITTEEMAN
City Will Give Use of Grounds North
of City for Ten Years and Help
With the Improvements.
The Cedar City Commercial club, or
tho persons who aro working to ef
fect Its organization, met In the Li
brary auditorium last Tuesday even
ing to hear tho report of tho commit
tees appointed Ut the previous meet
ing, one of which was to investigate
the present status of the county fair,
und report their findings nnd recom
mendations lo tho club, nnd the other
to look up uvuilnble quarters for tho
Commercial club und report their
findings.
City Will Give Loyal Support.
From the report of tho former com
mittee it is apparent that tho club
will have the loyul support of tho
mayor nnd city council in the matter
of arranging permunent fair grounds
and improvements. Tho committee
through its chairman, Mr. Walter
Granger, reported having waited on
tho city council in relation to obtain
ing a long lease or title to a tract of
its ground east of tho cemetery, and
that the council was quite willing to
grunt such use of tho property. As
surance was also given that if the
matter was to be undertaken in dead
earnest the city would pipe culinary
water onto ,thc property", and place
irrigation water at tho dispoRalof
tho committee or club for the purpose
of growing trees and shrubbery. It'
was also promised that tho city would
fence the tract and give other finan
cial aid.
This comittee also reported having
conferred with County Chairman
Pritchurd in relation to the fair, and
he had stated that Cedar City was en
titled to a resident member, and rec
ommended thut the people here select
the name of someone who thoy could
support to be submitted to the county
commissioners at their next meeting
for their ratification.
Francis Middleton is Selected. ,
Some three or four names were
nominated, a choice being arrived at
by ballot, and resulted in the selection
of Francis Middleton for a member
of tho county committee.
The committee appointed to look up
avnilnblo quarters for a homo for the
club reported thtrough Mr. Robert S.
Gardner, that some two or threo Bites
had been considered, but ta definite
proposition had been obtained on only
one of them, that being the upper
floor of tho Cedar Lumber and Com
mission building, for which u rental
of 25 per month was asked. The
building is not heated, except by the
use of stoves.
, There was a great deal of discus
sion in relation to thc cost of quar
ters, the- amount of dues to be col
lected from members, etc., but no defi
nite action was taken, except to con
tinue the committee in office and to
request them to get out definite plans
and recommendations for such quar
ters as in their best judgment the
club should undertake to provide at
this time, and to report to tho club
again at its next meeting.
Wide Range of Opinion.
There was a very wide runge of
opinion as to what sort of accommo
dations tho club should havo, tho es
tlmntes running all the way from a
very frugal suite of rooms for meet
ing and transacting business in, up to
the most elaborate plato glass build
ing In town, with exhibits of all our
products, pool nnd blllard tables, etc.
There was oven n suggestion that, wo
might apo tho Salt Lako Commercial
club, with its bar, champagne sup
pers and other social swagger, but
this was more in jest thun earnest.
Still there was a pronounced senti
ment in favor of pleasant and well
appointed quarters, where the social
as well as tho business side of life
could receivo somo consideration.
It was decided to hold regular meet
ings of the club on tho second nnd
fourth' Thursdays of each month.
Tho next mooting wjll bo on Thurs
day evening, March 23rd
Everybody Is Invited to come nnd
take part in tho deliberations, with a
viow of joining when tho club is fully
organized.

TO BUILD NEW SCHOOL
BUILDING AT PAROWAN
It has bocn decided by tho County
School Board that a new district
school building is a necessity for Par
owan, tho present building having
been condemned as unsafe and unfit by
the State Board of Health, the county
superintendent and other public of
ficials, and the proposition of bonding
the county schoof district in tho sum
of $40,000 for this purpose and for
an additional $5,000 for the improve
ment of the school buildings of tho
smaller districts, will shortly be sub
mitted to tho voters of the county
for their approval or rejection.
The bonded indebtedness covering
tho cost of Cedar City's new and mag
nlficlent school house is now cha'rged
against the county school district, and
sinco it has been decided that a new
building is imperative at Parowan,
tho voters of this placo should show
their generosity and respect for the
rights of others by voting solidly for
tho proposition of bonding when it
comes before them. Education is tho
great hobby in Utah. Our school sys
tem in this state is far In advance of
that of many of the older and more
densely populated states of tho Union,
and we should seo to it that tho fa
cilities for educating tho young peo
ple of Iron county are at least on a
par with tho other counties of this
state. When the proposition of bond
ing iB submitted, do not bo narrow or
selfish, but vote yes, and let the other
settlements havo the best school fa
cilities wo can possibly afford for
them.

to tho Governor this week. H
During tho year 424 cows havo been H
tested by the county agents and 454 H
tested through the high schools under H
tho direction of county agents. This H
determines for tho farmer which cows M
arc making him a profit and on which B
ho is losing. H
In Utah county an up-to-date ays- H
tern of water dividing and measuring M
weirs have been installed under the i M
direction of the county agent and in M
the state fifteen irrigation systems M
havo been planned for the farmers, M
covering 29,508 acres of land. M
Sevier county has begun, with the M
county agent's nid, the organization H
of a drainage district which will cov- H
er 35,000 acres of land.' Which when H
drained will bo worth $3,500,000. In H
its present state two-thirds of it is A H
worthless. Thirty-one other drainage ' H
systems covering 19,060 acres havo
already been planned. M
In Millard county 30,000 acres on H
750 farms were planted to Turkoy H
Rod wheat. The avorago yield of the , , H
