pOK, the information of the Liv
ingston correspondent the
writer wishes to state that the
reason why we failed to have a
letter in the Signal week before
last was that we occompanied one
of his democratic friends to the
State Republican Convention at
Louisville, and after returning
home we found that he hadigotten
so much real enthusiasm from
what he had seen and heard that
we hesitated to leave him to the
raei'cies of that almost forgotten
party, thereiore we neglected ev
ery thing in a business way that
we thought would keep over.
