VALUABLE CLAY
DEPOSITS FOUND
;
■ ,
Large Bed of Kaolinite Located j
Near the City.
PURITY PROVEN BY TESTS
Kaolinite Used in Making Porcelain
and Chinaware Found in Com
mercial Quantities.
Glasgow may be at some future
date, and probably not so very far
distant, the center of a large indus
try for the manufacture of porcelain
and chinaware.
Large deposits of kaolinite, thej
clay formation is used in the manu- !
facture of porcelain, have been dis
covered about 14 miles from Glasgow,
and from the tests made, it is of ex
ceptionally high commercial value.
The discovery of the kaolinite beds
was made by Albert Nelson last fall,
who was interested in the formation
and out of curiosity brought some
samples home with him which he ex
hibited. Many of .those who first
saw them pronounced them of a lime
s to ne formation, but Mr. Nelson, to J
satisfy himself, sent some samples to
the state college at Bozeman, where I
they were tested. I
The report made by the state col- j
lege experts stated that the sam- j
pies were exceptionally fine grained, ■
pure specimens of kaolinite or clay, j
This clay, which was originally de- 1
posited under water at a considerable :
distance from the shore, is the type,
of rock used in the manufacture of j
porcelain and chinaware. Deposits j
of pure alumina or kaolinite are very
rare, and much of it that is used in
the manufacture of the best porce
lain is imported.
Mr. Nelson took up the matter of
whether or not the deposit would be !
of any commercial value with the col
lege experts, and they stated that it j
would be of high value if there was j
sufficient feldspar or quartz adjac
ent so that they could be used togeth
er in manufacturing porcelain. The
feldspar is necessary to give strength
to the kaolinite in making porcelain.
Mr. Nelson stated that there was any
amount of feldspar in that vicinity |
and the proximity of the field to the
railroad may make it highly valuable
some day.
According to Mr. Nelson, the kaoli
nite lies in a field about five miles
long and he stated that he dug down
four feet under the surface and still
did not reach bottom. There are also
large quantities overlaying the kao
linite which may also prove of com
mercial value.
The fact that there are such large
quantities of the kaolinite clay in this
1
vicinity and its pureness may be the
means of bringing to Glasgow pot
tery works and porcelain factories.
GREAT NORTHERN NEEDS CARS
Fifteen hundred box cars were or
dered on March 11 by the Great
Northern railway from the Haskell
and Barker Car company of Michi
gan City, Indiana. The cars are to
be delivered in the summer, begin

pation of a record breaking traffic.
They will cost in the neighborhood of
$1,400,000.
The order for 500 refrigei atoi cai s

placed today by the Great Northern
with the same company at a cost of
$850,000. These cars aie to be ma e

TO PROBE HAVRE DEATHS.
Dissatisfied with the report made
to them by officials of the Great
Northern railroad with reference to
the accident at Havre, March 5,
which resulted in two brakemen los
ing their lives and a third trainman
having his leg cut off, the state rail-|
road commission has set March 18
as the date for a hearing when a
thorough investigation will be made,
freight train, eastbound, and com
posed of 33 can, all connected up
with an engine, was standing in the
yards at Havre. There were 13 more
ears, with a caboose attached a boot
The hearing will be held at Havre
and officials of the railroad and alii
the surviving members of the crew,
will be present.
The accident happened in a peculiar
inanner, according to the reports
made to the railroad commission. A
|five car length from the first train,
land a part of the first train.
About the time the train was ord
; ered out, another freight came in
'from the west and the yartmastc.* ov
j dered the crew of the freigia which
had just arrived, to :un their train in
on the same tiack as the fro.L train
and to roupie up the 33 cars with the
30 cars.
The engineer of the second train
coupled onto the caboose of the first
and whistled out, but failed to get
a whistle reply from the head engine.
The former proceeded to close up the
gap between the cars of the first
train and in doing so, smashed the
platform of the caboose, instantly
killing Brakemen McKnight and Pur
k e", and cutting off the leg of the
! third trainman.
A report of the accident was im
mediately sent in to the commission,
but it was not satisfactory and the
investigation was ordered.

RECLAMATION
EXPERT^ COMING
I. D. O'Donnell Will Address
Farmers on Irrigation.
WILL SHOW BEST METHODS
Farmern Who Expect to 1'ie Irriga
tion Will Benefit by Hearing Him
Talk—Holds High Position.
Hon. I. D. O'Donnell, supervisor of
Irrigation of all government reebfa
mation projects of the northwest will
visit the Milk river project the lat
ter part of March, spending Friday,
March 24, in Glasgow. He will ad
dress the farmers of the irrigated and
dry land sections at the opera house
in Glasgow Friday afternoon at 2
o'clock.
The Glasgow Commercial club has
been corresponding with Mr. O'Don
nel for some time relative to his trip
to the Milk river project with a view
of assisting him in getting in touch
with farmers whose land will be un
der irrigation when the project is
completed. The information received
in a letter from Project Manager W.
W. Schlecht of Malta, stating Mr.
O'Donnell will be here on March 24,
is most gratifying and every effort
will be made by the club to see that
the visit is a success.
He will make the trip for the pur
pose of giving a detailed description
profitable, as well as most interesting
to the faimers covering" W methods '
to be pursued in preparing land for!
irrigation so that the best results may I
be obtained. He is coming at this j
time to enable the farmer to know
how to begin spring* work to the best
advantage and his talk will prove

Mr. O'Donnell is possessed of the
happy faculty of an ability to express
himself clearly and in a manner plain-,
ly understood by all. He intermixes !
a vein of humor in his talks relieving
it of the dryness expected from a
description of how to farm properly.
He is not merely a theorist, but a

PAPER STOCK SHORTAGE ACUTE
Shortage of paper stock in the Uni
ted States was discussed at a confer
ence .Monday, March 13, between Sec
retary Redfield and C. A. Holder of
the foreign trade adviser's office.
France's embargo on the export of
rags has caused many American
manufacturers to fear that they may
have to curtail production of their
mills.
The department began sending out
one million circulars to be posted in
postoffices and elsewhere throughout
the country urging that papers and
rags be saved. The commerce de
partment promises to put those who
Have papers and rags in touch with
Manufacturers. Chambers of com
merce and trade associations have
been asked to co-operate.

J'MMIE DIDN 1 GET IOLGH
Wednesday morning, a short, seedy
looking individual alighted from No.
2 and immediately inquired for the
county commissioners. He was di
rected to see Commissioner C. W.
Baylor who listened to his tale of woe.
"Jimmie the Tough," he said his

there ever was a bad man, he was it.'

WILL PURCHASE
FIRE APPARATUS
City Council Considering Buy
ing Chemical Engines.
NAY BUILD A FIRE HALL
Adequate Protection Will be Fur
nished Property Owners—Would
Lower Insurance Rates.
A meeting was held by the council
special committee on fire apparatus
and Chief Dug Hall with the Com
mercial club, Tuesday evening, in the
club rooms, at which time a plan was
outlined for the erection of a fire
hall and purchase of an auto truck.
Nothing definite was done except that
an expression of approval by those
present of the plans of the commit
tee to purchase chemical apparatus
for the immediate use of the fire de
partment.
H. H. Alvis of the American Fire
Hose and Apparatus company, who
offered two chemicals to the city at
a very reasonable figure, also out
lined a plan whereby a very effec
tive fire-fighting force might be de
veloped and the present insurance
rate in Glasgow materially reduced.
His plan contemplates creating the
city of Glasgow as a special improve
ment district to be bonded for the
purpose of raising ten or fifteen thou
sand dollars. This sum would be suf
ficient to erect a building suitable for
use by the city officials for offices, a
jail and rooms for the fire department
and also the purchase of a motor
hose and chemical truck. There
would also be rooms provided for two
or more paid firemen. Mr. Alvis
agreed to take the bonds at par; they
would be made to mature in ten, fif
teen or twenty years. His proposi
tion also provides that should the
city decide to erect such a building j
within three years and purchase j
equipment of his company, the two,
chemicals would be taken back at the
full value paid for them by the city.
As there was not a quorum of the
dueao f s Posent, no definite action
was ' n this matter, those près

VICTOR DECKER DIES
IN ST. PAUL HOSPITAL
Attack of Typhoid Cause of Death of
Former Resident..
Word was recieved here Wednes
day afternoon of the sudden death of
Victor Decker in St. Paul on March
following a short illness of typhoid
fever.
About a year ago Vic,
left for St. Paul and took a position
with the Twin City Rapid Transit,
Co. as conductor. He held this posi-1
as he was.
known to almost everyone in the city
tion until last fall, when he was stric
ken with pneumonia and pleurisy of
the heart. He recovered from this
attack and returned t«* Glasgow to
recuperate, hoping to regain his
strength and return to his old position
j as soon as ' u ' was strong enough.
About a month ago he left again foi
! St. Paul to resume his duties, but he
fell a victim to typhoid, and his con
i dition became so serious that his
' folks here were notified and Tuesday
I morning Geo. F. Burke left for St.
! Paul - and was at Vio ' s s ' dt ' when
the end cams
1 Victor Vivian Decker was born at
heiMinot, North Dakota., on September
20, 1892 being 21 years of age at the
time of his demise. He had been a
resident of Glasgow for many years'ing
and to his many friends here who
remembered seeing him here, hale
and hearty, smiling and good natured,
the news of his death came like a
blow from a clear sky. For a number
of years he worked for .the Glasgow
Cash Grocery company, and his
pleasant manner and genial disposi
tion made friends for him Everywhere.
He was the picture of health then,
but his recent illness got the best of
him and he "cashed in his checks."
The body will arrive in the city on
No. 1 Friday morning and will be
met by a delegation of local Masons,
who will take charge of the body and
take it to the Congregational church,
where it will lie until the funeral,
which will be held Friday afternoon
at 2 o'clock.
The Masonic ceremonies will be
used at the church and at the grave,
and the funeral will be under the di
rection of the local Masonic lodge.
Rev. A. U. Baer will officiate at the
church.
The pall bearers will be R. S. Mc
Kellar, L. R. Jones, Fred Fischl, P.
A. Vornholt, G. A. Wright and Joe

WHEAT HELD BY MILLS.
The quantity of wheat held in in
j terior mills and elevators in the Uni
ted States on March first was clearly
.twice that held a year ago. accord
to a report on March 11 by the
bureau of crop estimates. The total
is estimated at 151,911,000 bushels,
or about 15 per cent of the 1915 crop.
Last year it was 85,955,000 and two
years ago 93,626,000. The figures do
| not include visible stocks at points of
large accumulation.
