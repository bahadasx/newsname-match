THE DEAR LITTLE SHAMROCK'
There's a dsar little plant that grows In our isle.
'Twas Saint Patrick himself sure that set it;
And the sun on his labor with pleasure did smile.
And with dew from hla eye often wet It.
It shines thro' the bog, thro' the brake and the mireland.
And he called it the dear little shamrock of Ireland,
The dsar little shamrock, the sweet little shamrock,
The dear little, sweet little shamrock of Ireland.
That dear little plant still grows in our land.
Fresh and fair as the daughter of Erin,
Whose smile can bewitch and whose eyes can command,
In each climate they ever appear in.
For they shine thro' the bog, thro' brake and the mireland.
Just like their own dear I ttle shamrock of Ireland,
The dear little shamrock, the eweet little shamrock.
The dear little, sweet little shamrock of Ireland.
That dear little plant that springs from our soil,
When its three little leaves are extended.
Denotes from the stalk we together should toil.
And ourselves by ourselves be befriended,
And still thro' the bog thro' the brske and the mireland.
From one root should branch like the shamrock of Ireland.
The doar little shamrock, the sweet little shamrock.

however, showed that Infantry ac

Leader Kitchin Closed Argument.
Dehate on the measure aroused lit
tle enthufti.-ism until late in the dav
when Majority Leader Kitchin took
the floor to clo.e the arcumenL it
was one of the f-w times Mr. Kitchin
has apparfd for administration meas
ures during the s.-.ion. Almost ev
ery republican member was present to
s"e him quizzed by the minority tar-
in experts.
Cannon Answers Kitchin.
A rapid exchange resolved Itself in
to a gfnral assault upon and defense
of the entire Underwood-Simmons
tariff act.
Opening with the declaration that
the republican party was the original
rree sugar organization of the United
Stat and quoting from congressional
records and campaign books of the
early 0's to prove h's assertions, the
majority lender drew attacks from
Formor Speaker Cannon. Representa
tive Fordney of Michigan: Cooper of
Wisconsin: Greene of Vermont and
other republican tariff! specialists.
Democrats Not Committed to Free Su
gar.
The sole cause of the proposed re
peal of the free sugar clause, Mr. Kit
chin said, waa that Imports had fall- -en
off because of the European war,
making the s'lgar taxes necessary to.
meet me expanse or the government. .
Incidentally he declared the democra
tic party never had committed Itself
to a free sugar act for all time.

Jir. Kitcnin replied, "as you Dromleed ;
to revise the tariff after a commie- '
sion had acted and specially declared
tne 1'ayne act was too high and ought
to he cut down."
Bailey Attempted to Amend Bin.
Representative Bailey made a futile,
attempt to amend the bill so as to '
suspend the free clause until May 1.
1917. by which time, he said, he hoped
the war would be over. Motions by
Representative Howard to re-commlt
and to amend the measure so as to
preserve a tariff of one-half a cent a '
pound on sugar and to place a tax of
35 per cent, on raw silk were over
whelmingly defeated.
