PROGRESS OP THE WAR.
The intensity of the fighting at Ver
dun has apparently passed, at least for
the time, after three weeks of perhaps
one of the greatest battles of any war,
and certainly of thi6 war.
That the Germans have suffered great
loBses in this long continued struggle is
as certain as the fact that they are the
brave men that they are. That the
French have alsb suffered great losses is
as certain that it took great bravery to
withstand the awful assaults of the vast
hordes of men and guns that were pitted
against them.
What a failure at Verdun means to
the Germans will rather be shown in the
future than at the present. Apparently
strategically there is as yet no important
change in the position of the battle lines.
In a general way the French lines are
nearly where they were before the battle
while the German forces have moved up
nearer.
The general military policy of General
Joffre has been carried out in this strug
gle. He has for the most part allowed
the Germans to do the assaulting, tie
is content to hold his lines against the
assaults. This has been the policy for
most of the time during the last year.
Joffre evidently believes that his
strongest alley is time. That if he can
juBt hold his iron band" about Ger
many that in time Germany will be de
feated. Certainly such a military policy
saves the expenditure of many lives for
the defenders and forces his opponents
to make desperate assaults like this at
Verdun with consequent losses with
small gains.
Along our own border we have our
selves begun a small war with the Mexi
can bandit, Villa. Villa with about 700
or 800 men attacked a small garrison of
U. 8. soldiers at Columbus and before
the fight was over had killed and wound
ed about thirty people, about half of
whom were soldiers and the rest citizens.
They also set tire to several buildings.
The troops were taken by surprise but
as soon as they got themselves together

on this state of affairs with
Mexico.
A Swedish ship was torpedoed this
I week and several sailors of Norwegian

were-drowned. The crew declares that

without warning. The ship was unarm

from settlement than it is diplomatically.
HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF.
From what we can learn the socalled
Non-Partisan Political Party has com
pletely absorbed the Democratic party in
this part of ttie county. On the olher
hand there are but few of the farmers
identified with the Republican party
who have joined them. This exodus
trotu the Democratic ranks reminds us
:f the close of President Cleveland's first
administration. The discontent with the
result of the Democratic policy fathered
the Populist party which amalgamated
with the Farmers Alliance. Many of
our readers will remember the clamour
there was to get on "the band wagon,"
and the wonderful reforms that were to
be accomplished. The farmers Alliance
lost its identity and the politician rode
to success with loud cries for "reform."
Tne party flourished for a while, but as
soon as they assumed responsibilities
through success at the polls they reach
ed their level and in a few years the par
ty was extinct. Several of the leaders
were elected to office which proved to
be the underlying principle of the
movement.
The Non-Partisan Political Party dif
fers materially in its organization from
the Populist Party the former takes. in
actual farmers only, while the Populist
Party was open to all believers in
reform. Again, the Non-Partisan pro
moters are charging the farmers a mem
barship fee, based upon what they charge
to join, and the membership claimed by
their official organ, they must have sev
eral hundred thousand dollars in the
treasury. This amount on the face of it
looks suspicious. The promoters nearly
all are strangers. Take a pencil and fig
ure what it would cost toplac6 an organ
izer in every rural precinct in the state
for a month, yes several months, and
compare it with the money that must
have been taken in by the organizers
and it will astonish you.
The Pioneer Express publishes
this to place our readers on the lookout
for a class of politicians who prey upon
the public through all sorts of schemes,
which is often done. For twenty eight
years the Pioneer Express has been hew
ing to the line as we have seen it, some
time in opposition to our financial inter
ests and we. leave our readers to judge
if we have not been right. Beware.
The United States department of agri
culture has issued a circular to the ef
fect that a wheat called "Polish wheat"
is being offered to farmers in the west at
the exhorbitant price of one dollar a
pound. It is of the Durum variety,
with a larger kernel and longer bead. It
is claimed by those having it for sale
that it will yield from 85 to 150 bushel
per acre. The department says that the
accumulative evidence regarding this
wheat does not indicate that it has any
value that will in any way justify the
charge of a dollar a pound for the seed,
and they ask the Pioneer Express to ad
vise the farmers not to be misled by the
glowing statements regarding yields and
value which ha9 been made concerning
this variety.

"WATCHFUL WAITING.
The despatches of last Friday an
nounced that, at least for a time, the
period of "watchful waiting" on tht
Mexican border was enued.—and ac
cording to the story as told we were not
waiting very watcnfully, as shown by
the fact that a thousand Mexicans under
Villa had no apparent trouble in sur
prising a body of U. S. troops in a bord
er town.
The news as expected has raised a big
excitement and "war spirits" are flying
all over the land as thick as crows in the
spring.
Aud yet there is nothing tobesurpris
ed at. There's nothing but the expect
ed happened. Indeed, there's nothing
happened very different than has oc
curred at various times during the last
two or three years, except there were
more American killed and wounded at
one time. The Mexican bandits have
been doing this sort of thing right along
—while we have been watchfully wait
ing.
Waiting for what? Watching for
what? The only answer is shown by
the orders from the President and the
war department. The massacre at
Columbus is evidently what we were
waiting for, and orders to our troops
the answer. Killing by ones, twos or
more we watched—while we waited un
til they had killed a scote.
Waiting for what? Watching for
what?
Waiting for the Mexican to become
civilized? waiting until they learned to
love the"Gringoes?"waiting until all the
brigands and bandits had killed each
other off waiting until the peons found
a Washington among them waiting un
til the foreigners who own or hope to
own "concessions" joined in making a
stable government.
And now what?
It will probably be an easy job to
catch Villa unless he dissolves and scat
ters his army which is the probability.
If we catch him what shall we do "with
him? If we hang or shoot him there
are several hundred other Villa9 to take
his place. Whatever is done we cannot
annihilate all Mexicans.
The immediate problem of catching
and hanging Villa is but a small part of
the job. It is only an incident. It
makes little consequence in itself.
But what are we to do with and about
Mexico and Mexicans?
There live about ten millions pf Mexi
cans of whom about nine millions can
not read or write. Most of these are ab
jectly poor. Most have no ambition'that
goes beyond the sundown of the present
day. "Manana," (tomorrow) is in the
fai future, let manna take care of itself.
We can tlx up the Villa incident in a
few days or weeks, but how many years
of watchful waiting and direct care will
it take us to civilize Mexico?
And no matter bow long we may
watchfully wait on this side of the line,
the history of a century, proves that tin
ally we must cross over and govern that
country until they are able to govern
themselves.
Tbe Pioneer Express, has for many
years believed thai intervention would
finally be necessary ana we think most
people now agree with us.

PEMBINA, PEMBINA COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, FRIDAY, MARCH 17th, 19X6.!
MANITOBA GOES DRY
While mo9t pec pie were of the opinion
that Manitoba would vote for prohibi
tion on Monday last, few expected that
the vole would be so overwhelmingly
against tbe liquor business, While full
returns are not complete at this writing
yet tbe vote already stands more than
two to one in favor of prohibiting the
sale of liqour in that province after June
1st of this year.
Winniprg voted nearly 5,000 majority
in a favor of going dry which was some
what of a surprise even to the temper
ance people. The soldier vote which was
expected to faver the sale generally went
dry by large majorities.
The result is somewhat surprising and
to some extent very remarkable. Liquor
selling in that province was already re
stricted to hotels, under tbe.argument
that hotels could not be made profitable
without a bar attachment. There are
sixty-seven such botel bars in Winni
peg alone and nearly two hundred in the
province.
The result is one more stroke of the
bell that is tolling the gradual death of'
John Barleycorn. The sound of that
funeral bell is reverberating all round
tbe earth- Tbe iroral forces and edu
cation that have been going on quietly
but surely for the last fifty or more years
are now culminating, and the liquor
business is fairly on the run.
From all the economic stand points
the liquor business has been driven.
Every argument whether financial or
moral has been proven against the busi
ness.
Whiskey .".money has no value. It does
not pay the drinker, it does not pay the
saloon keeper, it does not pay tbe muni
cipality.
We append the results of the vote in a
few of the towns which are our neigh
bors near the border. The first figures
quoted are favorable to prohibition and
the second are against prohibition
