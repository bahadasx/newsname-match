il General Carranza Concerned

H1 1
b f El Paso, Texas, March 17. A few
llSJ 5 definite facts about the American cx-
hg ? peditlon Into Mexico today stood out
W 4 with considerable clearness as the
reS I result of official published reports and
fs the news brought here by Americans
- -who have been In touch with some
5j portion of the American movement
oik ;t It seemed certain that of the two
loi7 '$ columns which are "somewhere In
iff i Mexico" one was constituted for
i -J speed, while the other apparently was
ragt, moving more slowly. The swift foot-
Qaj ed column, the auxiliary army, seem-
mh lngly mostly cavalry, went into Mexl-
? co fifty miles west of the main army
p? ' of General John J Pershing, when his
nojj forces crossed at Columbus. N. M.
5cr( 1 Secrecy Is Profound.
14 l The secrecy which has surrounded
jf i the movements of the main column
j i has Been slight compareu wun me
iK I record of this western force. There
3a .f is reason to believe, from the official
ST v, announcements, that the western col-
btf! ' umn may have gone into Mexico ear-
rai' 'i Her than the main body. Every re-
o? 3 port arriving here from the border
ijj 'j asserts that the western wing has
9? ;J traveled the -farther. By these same
i5j v- reports, the two columns will form a
W ? Junction near the threatened American
if? 1 Mormon colonists, possibly in the
af- ' Casas Grandes region.
it ? Sniping Acts Unverified.
f 5 r
t ft Reports that snipers had shot at the
! S1 troops remained unverified today. How-
2l 1$ ever, sniping and even the possible
; ;v killing or wounding of a few American
I 'k soldiers by these long range marks-
'- men was not regarded here as an ln-
'4 dication that the American army's
march up to date was otherwise than
i a peaceful expedition so far as the
. i majority of the Mexican people are
concerned. Sniping has become com-
i mon. on the American side in this sec-
'X tion, with the difference that on the
American side the sharpshooters have
. had only comparatively small targets
Li to shoot at. such as a horseman, an
automobile or at best a railroad train.
There is nothing to prevent lndividu
$ als of this type, acting entirely on
their own initiative, -from creeping in
: to some hill and sending a few bullets
1 at a distant column of troops.
1 Occupation of Cities.
f Carranza officials, it was learned
A tdday, fcave been discussing Iwlth
isome concern whether American
troops during the Villa pursuit would
have to occupy any Mexican cities and
the effect of such occupation upon
Mexican public sentiment. The Car
ranza officers have frankly expressed
the hope that the garrisoning of the
cities can bo left to their own troops.
The American army's choice of the
"4 Chihuahua desert as its place of its
entry precludes for the present such, a
problem as city garrison duty.
4 Cost of Villa Pursuit.
It la estimated hero that the cost
I of the Villa pursuit at present is up-
ward of $40,000 per day. There Is
;, one soldier In the Carranza garrison
at Juarez who is frankly anti-Carran-!
za. He is a 13 year-old boy who was
, captured with the Villa garrison at
'' Juarez and whose life was spared on
' the condition that he turn Carranzlsta.
His name, he said today, formerly
f, was "Little Pancho Villa,"
"And now" -he added, "It Is Little
Carranza."
. "Whom do you like best?" he was
B fit ed
"Pancho Villa" was the reply.
Water was running today In the irri
gation dltcheB hack of the Juarez
I r race track and thereby was explained
a sensational report widely published
1 J. early this week that the Juarez gar
i rison was digging military trenches.

GREAT ANXIETY
FELT AT BORDER
Uneasiness Rapidly Growing
Among American Citizens
Throughout Mexico Espe
cially in North and West.
El Paso, Tex., March 17. Rapidly
growing uneasiness amoug Americans
throughout Mexico especially in the
north and western part was evinced
today by reports from various sections
that United States citizens were
either on their way to the border or
were practically ready to leave.
At every point of entry along the
northern and northwestern border
Americans arrived today from the in
terior, but in the majority of in
, stances they said they were leaving
Mexico merely as a matter of precau
tion and not because of any overt acts
of hostility against them.
The most significant report was re
ceived from Durango where the Amer
ican vice consul advised that his wife
and child be sent out of the country
This followed closely on the arrival
lasi night on the border of the Amer
ican consul from Torreon with a large
numhei of Americans.
Disquieting Stories Told.
An erlcans arriving here brought
numerous disquieting stories about
the attitude of the Mexicans in tho
interior, especially in Chihuahua, Du
rango and Coahuila, but invariably
they told the stories privately and
when asked to make any statement
for publication insisted that every
thing was quiet in the section from
which they came. They explained the
contradiction by saj'iug that they ex
pected to return to Mexico when
things became more settled and they
did not wish to say anything which
might arouse resentment of the Mex
icans. An American who arrived to
day at the City of Chihuahua reported
that all was quiet there yesterday.
Villa Murders Cowboys.
The Mexican consul here received a
telegram from General Calles, mili
tary governor of Sonora, saying that
a Villista spy, R. Panobilos was ar
rested at Dose Cabesas. It is alleged
that this man was in Columbus on
-the night of the raid. When ques
tioned he said Villa had fled after the
raid to Corralltos where he murdered
several cowboys and seized a number
of horses. He then started for Ga
laena by way of Puerto Chocp.
Calles Troops to Co-operate.
Douglas, Arizona, March 17. Car
ranza troops of General P. Elias Cal
les, mllitar -governor of Sonora, were
making every effort today to co-operate
with the soldiers composing the
punitive expedition 'from the United
States In tho pursuit of Francisco Vil
la, according to reports received here.

AMERICAN MINES
TO CLOSE DOWN
Properties in Sonora to Sus
pend Temporarily Through
Fear of Mexican Ani
mosities. Nogales, Arjzona, March 17. Re
ports were received here today from
apparently authentic sources that
numerous American mining properties
In the Hermoslllo-Guaymas district of
Sonora are suspending operations tem
porarily through fear of disaffection
among the natives as a result of the
American pursuit of Villa. The larg
est of these was said to be the MInas
Prletau of the Creston Colorado com
pany, north of Guaymas which has
employed about 1500 men.
A train from that district tomorrow
night is expected to bring a number
of the Americans to the border. A
train leaving here for the south today
carried a number of Americans, none
of whom expressed any fear. The
towns on either sido of the border
here continued tranquil today. A
tralnload of Carranza troops who had
been encamped a few miles south of
Nogales, Sonora, left today ostensibly
to reinforce the garrison at Cananea.
An ammunition car said to be carrying
about 500,000 rounds, was attached.
Both the American military men
and the Carranza authorities here are
making every attempt to discourage
sonsatlonal and unusually unfounded
reports which have originated In this
district.

TROOPS TO MAKE
NIGHT MARCHES

WOUNDED BY VILLA
FOLLOWERS IN RAID
Lieut. Clarence Benson.
Lieut. Clarence Benson, 13th U. S.
cavalry, was wounded in Villa's raid
on Coiumbus, New Mexico. He is a
graduate of West Point, and for two
years has been on patrol duty on tha
Mexican border, stationed at Colum
bus and Douglas, Ariz,
clsco Villa, it was indicated today at
Fort Sam Houston.
Night marches would help to mys
tify ilia as to the movements of the
American columns and would be easy
of accomplishment, it is said, because
there is sufficient light for the pur
pose. Also they would keep the men
and horses fresher. Days could be
used tor reconnoitering.
Daylight marches make it Impossi
ble to hide troop movements. Huge
clouds of dust indicate the marchers'
progress and are visible at great dis
tances. i (
No Music for Soldier.
There will be no music for the sol
diers of either General Pershing's or
Colonel Dodd's commands to enjoy
while on the march or in camp. Not a
single regimental band has been tak
en with the expedition. This Is be
cause it was desired not to handicap
the expedition with any useless ap
pendage not because the absence of
martial music was expected to aid in
secrecy regarding troop movements.
Word was received today that C. A.
Williams, American consul who quit
Torreon when trouble with Villa
broke out, is on his way here from
L-arcdo, where he arrived yesterday.
At tho army post nothing was known
of Williams' coming. It was said he
had not been asked to make any re
port to army officials.

SUBMARINES TO

Germans Declare Memoran

NEW MINISTER CHOSEN
Press Feels There Will Be Uni
versal Regret-Over Forced
Retirement of Admiral
Von Tirpitz.
Derlin, March 1C, 10 a. m., via Lon
don, March 17, 12:39 a. in German
olflcialc repeat the statement that
submarine warfare will go to the
limits set by the German memoran
dum to neutral powers of last month,
but that the demands of those who
wished to see the indiscriminate tor
pedoing of "whatever comes In front
of the torpedo tubes," to the use the
expression of one o those who advo
cate this policy, will not be fulfilled.
This is also the deduction which
those acquainted with the situation
declare can be drawn from the resig
nation of Admiral von Tlrpltz, which
'vas foreshadowed a few days ago by
Jie lororts of his Illness. The con
clusion is said to be strengthened by
the tact that Admiral von Capelle has
been chosen as the new minister. He
Is known merely as an excellent ad
ministrative officer, not having had
ship command In the last twenty-five
years Diring this period he has been
at the admiralty, first as adviser on
milllaiy affairs, then In tho budget
departments and finally as head of
the administrative department. Pie
was looked on as the right hand man
of Admiral von Tirpitz until his re
tirement last November. i
Retirement Causes Sensation. !
The Tages Zeltung, one of the
strongest supporters of Admiral von
lirpitz, says that it is "shaken by
the nown, of the admiralVrebignatlon'
and Uoes not at present feel itself in
a c- ndltlon to comment thereon."
The Morgenpost says:
"There wll lbe universal regret that
circumstances made the retirement of
the grand admiral necessary. The
reasons for this and the inner rela
tions of affairs with one another can
not now be discussed but It will be
regretted that there was no other way
out"
All tho newspapers pay high com
pliment to the career of Admiral von
lirpitz.
HEATED DEBATE
OVER RECRUITING
Calling of Married Men Meets
Opposition in England
House Session Extends
Far Into Night.
CONFERENCE SATURDAY
Special Meetings of Liberal
and Unionist War Commit
tees Organized Opposi
tion to Government.
London, March 17, 2-54 a. m. It was
well past one o'clock this morning
when the house of commons adjourned
after a protracted debate nominally
on army estimates but really covering
a wide range of topics.
There were many heated .passages
regarding the problem of calling out
married men. Sir John A. Simon, ex
secretary for homo affairs, among
others, appeared as the champion of
the married men, but his speech met
with sharp criticism from other cham
pions of the married men owing to
his argument that there was danger
of over-recruiting.
tl wns announced in the lobby of
the house of commons that a confer
ence will be held Saturday at the war
offlco between the higher military au
thorities and the recruiting command
ers when the whole requirements of
the army in regard to men will be
fully discussed and explained.
Agitation Is Widespread.
It Is stated that tho widespread agi
tation on tho part of the married men
has already lnterferred somewhat
with the war office arrangements but
there Ib little doubt that the calling
up of further groups of married men
has been only briefly postponed.
Among the proposals now being con
sidered is that of extending the mili
tary age for single men to 45 years.
There Is also a widespread feeling that
tho compulsion act should bo extend
ed to the married men as a consider
able part of the til-feeling among mar
ried men now being called is due to
tho fact that those Tvho voluntarily en
rolled under tho Derby scheme must
go Into tho army while married men
who declined the Invitation to enroll
are allowed to continue In their civil
occupations.
Tho real seriousness of Reeling
throughout the country on this mat

Paris, March 16, S:35 p. m. The
retirement of Admiral von Tirpitz is
considered in French official circles,
according to the Paris newspapers, to
be due to the fact that he has opposed
tho coming out of the German fleet,
whilo Emperor William desires to
see It engage the British naval for

drawn, that a change may bo looked
for In the German naval policy and
that tho recent appearance of German

that preparations are being made for

"East of the Meuse, a recrudescence
of the bombardment was followed at
8 o'clock last night by violent offen
sive actions, directed against our po
sitions at the village and fort of Vaux.
"Five successive attacks in large
numbers were delivered by the Ger
mans In this region but without suc
cess. Two of them were against the
village of Vaux: two others against
the slopes leading up to the fort, and
the fifth was an effort to emerge
from a protected roadway southeast
of the village of Vaux.
"Even' one of these attacks was
broken by our curtain of fire, and the
fire of our machine guns cost the en
emy heavily.
"In the Woevre district there is
nothing to report further than artil
lery exchanges in all sectors west of
Pont-a-Mousson. A surprise attack
against a salient of the enemy lines at
the wood of Mort made it possible for
us to bring back some prisoners and
to inflict some losses upon the en
