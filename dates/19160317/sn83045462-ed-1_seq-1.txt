I ortv -peakers have asked lor'

crats were equally represented on j
tile li-t. and all were expected to!
favor a w ide degree of national |
preparedness, w hatever tlieir at- b
tittide might be on the committee j

No Opponents in Sight.
hen the debate began no opponent
of the general plan of preparedness had
asked to be heard.
?"hairman Hay of the military ?ommittee
and Representative Kahtt. rank- 1
inn republican member, apportioned
the ten hours equally. No general opposition
was in evidence. So far as is
known no committee member will favor
reduction of the provisions for the regular
army or the National Guard, although
set era I are known to favor a
larger standing army. i
Speaker ?'lark. who will delive" an
address in support of the measure, surrendered
the chair to Representative
Garrett of Tennessee at the beginning :
of the debate.
Representative Gordon, democrat, of:
Ohio led ofT for the bill. He had been j
Jisted as an anti-preparedness man. but j
explained today that his opposition was;
only to a great standing arin>.
Unanimous Report.
Representative Ila\ told the House
the fad that the committee had readied
a unanimous report on the bill indicated
the feeling of the country on the
vital subject of preparedness.
Ail Americans should stand together

of party lines. The bill was far-reaching,
he continued, and prepared in a i
ane and safe way. not going to ex- '
ernes on either side. The only real1
opponents, lie added, must come from '
those who oppose an;, measure of

point out that while the biil proxdded

President could biing it up to more!

The opinion accredited to the eapta
thai the Tubantia was torpedoed adi
to the feeling of resentment aroused 1
j the disaster. The Vaderland calls a

A stronger- irote is sounded by tl

says that no matter, whether ti

; Mr. McCumber Warns Senate
,-! Against Being Stampeded
Into Extravagances.
d
\-sorting that the I nited
i .
States was in less danger ot attack
than ever before in its hisItory,
Senator McCumber of North
) Dakota warned the Senate against
| being stampeded by imaginary
I dangers into wild and reckless
I military and naval extravagances.
Great Britain, lie said, could not proII
tect her commerce against the United
i States with three times her present
: navy. Germany, he added, has lost
j practically all her war vessels and
j practically all her merchant marine;
' France has a third of her territory in
the hands of an enemy; a large portion
! of Russia's armies are prisoners of war
>- i to t'ne Teutons, and Japan is still benn!_
| ing under the load of her last war tax.
"For this country, as powerful, measY
urcd by its resources, as any two itarr
tions now exhausting themselves in the i
^ deadly European struggle, with the.
' ocean between us. to Jose its head is]
e worse than senseless." lie said.
> No Exigency From Present War. i
e i The present demand for preparedness
could not be based on any exigency rej
suiting from the present war. he said.
; because a campaign begun now would
rr ; not produce a single battleship for two |
s ; years.
| "Congress in its growing servility
) 1 has allowed its function to be usurped
by the executive until it has become
the tool to convert presidential proe
. grams into law." he said.
e "Congress should be the judge of the
. necessity and of the propriety of
" changing our historical attitude.
"The moment Great Britain accepted
s our challenge to war our cruisers
would scatter over the ocean in search
of her merchantmen. While she would
h be attempting to guard the escape
- from New York or Charlestown or New
Orleans, we wouia we sending: cruisers
? from Sari Francisco, Portland and Scatty
lte, we would be sending: submarines
- to attack her ships from a hundred
t other ports.
t
f U. S. Could Crush Canada.
il
e "Looking to the northward, we could
- send an army of such size as to crush
: all resistance of her principal colony,
^ Canada. It would be impossible for
I, her In case of war to land a sufficient
? number of men to defend that province.
"Her stake would be too heavy ever
* to court war with the United States if
_ she could with national honor prevent
it.
"I admit that we could force war on
Germany if we insist upon dictating
now auc oiiau V.U..UUOL jici war against
j her enemies in every particular, and
v we could declare war on her, but that
r will not happen and if it should hapu
pen the five years' program would not
e help us now.
y "And is it Japan? Can that little is- j
. land of 45,000,000 people, poorest of the j
poor, with no credit on the face of the i
earth, attempt to make a war on a na- j
- tion two and a half times her popula- j
tion. 100 times her resources and 300
times her territory?
"Will the present war craze of Ku- !
rope develop into such utter imbecility j
of any of the great nations that ft
would attempt an invasion of the
United States?
"Every warring nation Knows that if
we should throw the weight of our
great prowess against either of the
nearly balanced forces now at war it
would mean the quick defeat of the
power against which it should be
hurled. No nation is pursuing a policy
detrimental to our interests because of
our military or naval weaknesses."

Appropriation Measure Provides U.S.

pality Paying What It Can.
The District appropriation bill,
carrying approximately $13,000.'
000. was practically completed to:da\
by the subcommittee, beaded
i by Representative Rage of North
j Carolina, of the House appropriaitions
committee. The subcommittee
has gone through the hearings
and has drafted a complete
measure, with the possible exception
of a few street items. These
will not be completed until members
of the subcommittee have
the opportunity to visit the streets
for which appropriations are
asked.
It is understood that the bill will
j carry out the main recommendat ion of
1 the joint select committee which investigated
the fiscal relations between
, the roiled States and the District of
Ooiuuibta. This will be in the form of
a short legislative proviso by which
| the District of Columbia will pay for
the items in the bill up to the full extent
of iis financial ability, following
which the I'nlted States Treasury will
supply what is needed.
No attempt will be made in the subcommittee.
at least, to include any of
the suggested legislation concerning
an inheritance tax, etc. The attitude of
the subcommittee is plainly opposed to
loading up the District bill with legislation
which has not already been approved
by the District committee.
The rumor that Borland would endeavor
to attach his rider to the bill, to
affect the District building employes
only, has not received an uproarious
reception from the committee.
.The District appropriation bill will
. betaken up by the full appropriations
committee in about one week and probably
immediately reported to the House.

Occupation of Towns Worries.
Carranza officials, it was learned t
day. have been discussitiR with sor
concern whether American troops, du
ing the Villa pursuit, would have
occupy any Mexican cities and the e
feet such occupation would have up<
Mexican public sentiment.
The Carranza officers have frank
expressed the hope that the garriso:
j lug of the cities can be left to the
own troops. The American armj
choice of the Chihuahua desert as i
place of entry precludes for the pre
ent such a problem as city garrisc
{ dut y.
j It is estimated here that the cost .
i the Villa pursuit at present is upwai
of $40,000 per day.

Thinks American Guides Efficient
"The Americans have guides of the
own," he said, "who. 1 am sure, a:
as good as any we could give them,
feel equally certain that they have be
ter maps than any we have. The so
diets of Gen. Carranza are marchin
against Villa, the American soldiei
are doing the same. That seems to n
to be co-operation, and it is all 1 ha\
4^o say."
Rumors of disaffection and revo
among the Carranza troops are c
plentiful here as there are people t
spread their, out all reliable informs
tion is to the effect that thus far a
least the first rhief and his lieutenant
have maintained strict order. ^^^1^
seems no question that a considerabl
portion of the Mexican people bit
terly resent the presence of America
troops in their country, but as far a
is known they have shown their hos
tility by no overt act."
Night Marches Are Expected.
Night marches probably will be mad
by Gen. John J. Pershing's forces i
their search for Villa, it was indi
cated at Fort Sam Houston today.
Night marches would help to mys
Itify Villa as to the movements of th
American columns, and would be eas
I of accomplishment, it is said, becaus
1 there is sufficient light for the pur
puse. This also would keep the men am
horses fresher. Days could be used fo
reconnoitering.
Daylight marches make it irtipossi
ble to hide troop movements. Cloud
of dust indicate the marchers' progresi
and are visible at great distances.
There will be no music for the sol
diers of either Gen. Pershing's or Col
[Dodd's commands to enjoy while 01
