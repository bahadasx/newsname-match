" As I felt that tlie people were in

of the general assembly, I want
Xorth accompanied by Senator J. Arthur
Banks, to see the insurance people

ings with this firm I have found the
senior member, George C. Stevens, a
most elegant gentleman, and our relations
have grown to he very cordial. j
"I explained the situation to Mr. Stevens
and he agreed to come to South
Carolina for the purpose of advising

an insurance standpoint. His firm
gave me assurances or their ability to
handle the entire insurance situation j
in South Carolina- if necessary, ibut '
they did not wish to invade the terri- |
tory of the agents if it could be :
avoided.
"Neither did I wish to do this, which
would have put many of these men
out of business, and as Samuels, Corn- !
wall & Stevens could get much cheaper j
rates than any agent in South Caro- j

for agents in the various counties to !

"After iM"r. Stevens got here and j
sition and my inexperience in insur- j
realized the magnitude the propo- j
ance matters, he consented to send for j
his chief e'erk, Phil La Tourtettc,
whom I know very well, and let him
stay here in my office until we could
get the situation well in hand. Before
Mr. La (Tourtette arrived, I called ?fcf .
McMaster, the insurance commissioner,
over the phone and told him that Mr. |

bring them together in order to get?tbe j
benefit of the experience and advice of
Mr. Stevens in handling this matter.
"Mr. McMaster seemed to think it j
would be better for him not to meet I
Mr. Stevens and told me to handle it I
in my own way. As iMr. 'Stevens and
Mr. LaTourtette handle a large part of
our insurance. I appointed them State
warehouse inspoetors. with special j
reference to insurance, in order to |
given them official standing in South j
Carolina and to protect them against
interference.
"On last Friday afternoon, having
hrrn awav from home for three weeks.
I was obliged on aecoun.' of business
affairs to leave for Hennettsville on
the Seaboard train at 4:20 o'clock. The
understanding was that Messrs. Stev.
ns and La Toutette would go to
Charleston for the week-end and meet
me in Columbia again on Tuesday. I
.elt a little uneasy over the situation
and instead of remaining over until
Tuesday 1 came back to Columbia
Monday night. Instead of returning to
Columbia these eentlemen left Charles
ton for New York.
"While they were in Columbia we
had applications from all over the
State (and they continue to arrive) to
place insurance which had been cancelled
or was endangered. State warehouse

owned by G. A. Guignard. (The
rate on this house had been 40 cents
per $100. I knew that at any time In
the past year I could get a 20 cent
rate but Mr. Guignard did not carc to
take advantage of this on account o:'
personal relation 'between him and
the agent who had the insurance. We
placed through Mr. Stevens' firm in
Xew York the insurance on this State
warehouse property at 20 cents, just
one-half of what had been paid.
Senator Banks writes:
"To give an idea of how excessive
the rates in some cases were here is a
copv of a letter from Senator J. A.!
I
Banks, showing a reduction of more ;
than one-hal:' in the rate which he j
was paying on his property in the town
of St. Matthews, all of which goes to !

it was his duty to be satisfied that
they were not violating the criminal

agent not complying with the law as
to license, residence, etc., had th& right
to place insurance in South rCarolina
and if they did they were liable to arrest.

it was a matter of indifference to them
hether they got any outside business
or not.
"I believe that this situation can be
handled through Samuels, Cornwall &
Stevens, but there is no use for me to
bring men of that calibre and character
to South Carolina to aid me if they are
to be threatened with arrest and made

analysis of the situation. If a patient
is sick you try to diagnose the case and
find the nature of the disease.
"In my judgment there are four .
things primarily causing high insur- j
ance on fire risks in {South Carolina: |
"1. .There are too many agents anc? !
.he number causes the excessive com
missions which are paid to them.
"2. The valued policy law. which j
means that if I have a building that j
costs me $1,200 and it looks like !t
might have cost $1,500 and I take an ;
inexperienced agent and say, "This
building cost me $1,800,' and get threefourths
o;* $1,800 insurance on it when J
it cost me but $1,200; the value is >'
fivrri hv thr agreement of the asrent. ;
and if there is a total destruction the i
insured can collect his full valuation. \
no matter what the facts'may he as
j to the actual value, which enables a
j crook to over insure property and the
honest man lias to pay for it.
"3. The municipa1 'axes in South
Carolina. The 50 01 more companies
entered in South Carolinn probably
pay an a . erase of $500 at the lowest irr
municipal licenses or a minimum total

Fought Mc&istrr Bill.
"As to the immediate situation, here
I
1 is mv analvsis of that:
You will recall that during the
ession of the legislature, in a telephone
conversation, I called your attention
to house bill No. 40, known
he McMaster bill, and that I directed
' the attention of Mr. Ock>m, chairman
of the agriculture committee of the
house; Senator Banks, Senator Laney
and other leaders in the general assembly
to the danger of this measure.
|
"Xow, I think the trouble is not the
Laney-Odom bill, per se, dissolving
! the Southeastern and preventing them
j from coming into the State and arbij
tarily fixing rates, but the provisions
that were put into the Laney-Odom
j bill at Mr. McMaster's request, giving
him the power of establishing what|
ever rate in his judgment is the corrcr-t
miP anH the onlv recourse that
! the companies would have being an
appeal to the courts. The companies
fear that this would keep them perpetually
in litigation and subject them
to a ?*onn of annoyance which makes
it undesirable to do business in the
State.
"From the standpoint of the companies,
the pro-vision requiring them
to make oath at the end of the year
that no agent of the company has violated
any provisions of the act and fixing
a heavy criminal penalty makes
them afraid to do business. They say
' -! ? 5 ~
mat u is an irxipossiuiiu> iui <iu.> wfioer
a." the company to make oath that
no agent has violated the law, because
he would not have knowledge of such
a violation, and per contra it is equally
as impossible for an agent of the company
to make oath that no officer has
vioated any provision of the act for the
I reason that he could not know it. I

"The affidavits are not required to
be made until March 1, 1917. The
rv.mnanies could be given the assur
ance of the commissioner that they
would be protected in their business,
this assurance having fhe indorsement
of the governor, and these hardships
imposed by the act could be removed

before tho affidavits are required to be
made without interfering with the anti-compact
part of t.he bill.
"In conclusion. I deeire to say that
my advice is that those who desire to
place insurance in large amounts write
to Messrs. Samuels, Cornwall & Stevens,
No. 84 William street, and as to
the small country insurance, that just
as rapidly as possible mutual insur
ancc companies, such as exist in several
of the counties of the State at
present, be organized. *
"As soon as I learned tbat iMt. Ste

with him and giving him assurances
that he probably misunderstood

Columbia, March 14.?Fred H.

his resignation in tlie supreme court
immediately after concluding the argument
for the comptroller general
brought against that official by tne
board of regents o the State Hospial
for the Insane. The resignation is effective
immediately. Mr. Dominick
will continue to discharge the duties
of his office until Attorney General
Peeples appoints his successor. The

attorney general saia ne Knew uuiumg
o Mr. Dominick's intended resignation
until last night, and had not given any
though.: to naming a new assistant.
Neither Attorney General Peeples
nor Mr. Dominick had any statement
to make. Mr. Dominick will return to
Iiis home in Newberry and continue the
practice of law. He is a candidate for
congress in the third district against
Congressman Aiken, and will probably
begin an active canvsas for that
place.
Mr. Dominick Has a splendid record
as assistant attorney general, and in
his three years' administration of his
position has argued and "won several
big cases froth in the State and the
United States supreme courts. His
ability as an attorney is accorded wide
recognition and his administration or
