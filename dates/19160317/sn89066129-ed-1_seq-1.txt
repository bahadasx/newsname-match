Worry Causes Death
Some few months ago Dan Clark,
a highly respected and well to do
citizen of Linneus, owning a fine
farm between Linneus andPurdin,
fell into the hands of some land
sharks. They succeeded in selling
him a large track of Texas land at
$200 per acre, so it was reported.
He became dissatisfied over the
deal and worried a great deal about
it. Three weeks ago he went to
Texas on business connected with
the land and some time later he
was found in St. Joseph in a
demented condition. He was taken
to the hospital where he rapidly
grew worse until Monday, when he
passed away. He was 46 years of
age and leaves a widow and three
children.

Democratic Primary
Pursuant to the call of the chair
man and secretary of the county
central committee the democrats
of Jefferson township met at the
city hall last Saturday afternoon
and elected delegates to the county
convention held at Linneus Tues
day afternoon. J. Paul Jones was
chairman and Geo. Calhoun secre-,
tary of the township meeting. The
following delegates weie elected to
Linneus: J. W. Power, Geo. Cal
houn, Judge 0. F. Libby and Geo.
C. Denbo. The call for the county
meeting and the apportionment of
delegates were made by the county
chairman without consulting the
members of the committee, at least
the committeeman from this town
ship, and according to the call this
township was accorded but one
delegate. This was something un
usual and the Jefferson township
democrats didn't propose to be sat
on in any such fashion and pro
ceeded to elect four delegates to
the county convention and in
structed to cast the vote the town
ship was entitled to.
For Prosecuting Attorney
Formal announcement of the
candidacy of Chas. K. Hart for the
republican nomination for prose
cuting attorney will be found in
this issue. In his years of practice
in this county Mr. Hart has
demonstrated his ability as a
lawyer, gentleman and scholar.
His private life is above reproach
and his public life commends itself
to his constituency. We feel, how
ever, tnat .air uart is so well
known in this part of the county
that a lengthy notice from The
Blade is hardly necessary.
