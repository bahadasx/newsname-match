CONFERENCE C

?
County Mass Meetings to Consider
Insurance Situation Will
Be Arranged?Extra Session
Now is Not Advocated?Board
of Trade Delegates Form Permanent
Body.
A permanent organization to ob
tain tne sentiment ot tne people ol
South Carolina in regard to the insurance
situation was created yesterday
at a board meeting of representatives
from various commercial organizations
in the State, which in a
resolution declared that the LaneyOdom
measure "is inimical to the
business and farming interests of the
State." It was recommended also that
"some concerted action should be taken
at once, looking to the consideration
of the same."
To this end, William M. Otis of
Columbia, chairman of the meeting,
was authorized to appoint one person
in each county who shall arrange
for a joint meeting of the business interests,
commercial bodies, farmers
and legislative delegation for the
purpose of discussing the present situation
and suggesting appropriate
remedies therefor.
To Bring Test Suit.
The executive committee of the
permanent association was vested
with power to institute a suit to test
the constitutionality and validity of
the anti-compact law.
The sentiment of the meeting was
practically unanimous in opposition
to the Laney-Odom l^w. The suggestion
for the formation of mutual
companies to care for the shortage
ui insurance was classed as visionary;
it was held also that the dearth of
insurance would cause some cities to
become almost bankrupt; that it
would put building: and loan associations
out of business; that the
abolition of the S. E. U. A. would not
decreaseN rates; that the failure to
obtain insurance would militate
principally against the farming: and
mercantile interests.
Conference to Be Permanent.
Representatives of commercial bodies
in South Carolina, at a conference
yesterday in Columbia, adopted
almost unanimously resolutions, as
follows, drafted by a committee consisting:
of William M. Otis of Columbia,
chairman; A. T. Smythe of Charle'ston,
Legare Walker of Summerville,
W. B. Rloore of York and George
H. Edwards of Darlington:
"Resolved, That the temporary officers
of this meeting be made permanent,
and that they shall be ex-officio
members of a permanent committee of
five, the two other members to be appointed
by the chair, and that this
committee be. and is herehv rhnrcrod
with the duty of carrying into effect
the plan contemplated by these resolutions:
"Resolve, further, That it is the
sense of this meeting that the act
passed at the fast session of the
legislature in reference to insurance,
known as the Laney-Odom bill, is
inimical tp the business and farming
interests of this State and to the
proper development thereof, and that
some concerted action should be taken
at once, looking ot the consideration
of the same.
"Resolved, further, That the chair
appoint one person in each county
in this State and the person appointed
be charged with the duty of providing
for a joint meeting of the business
interests, commercial bodies, farmers
and legislative delegation at his county
seat at the earliest date possible,
with a view of having 'such joint
meeting carefully discuss the present
situation and suggest some appropriate
remedy therefor.
Resolved, further. That the said
committee in their discretion shall
have the right and is hereby invested
with authority to confer with such
State officers as they may deem prop,
er in the exercise of their duties under
these resolutions, and further to
submit the question to such attorneys
as they may see fit to pass upon
and advise them as to the legality of
the said act and the propriety of instituting
such action as may be advisable
to^est the constitutionality
and validity of the same."?Wednesday's

AMERICAN TROOPS
ON MEXICAN SOIL
8oM!era Again Enter Troubled Republic?Moving
Behind Veil?Dost
and Censorship Combine Effectually
to Cut Off Tidings of
Punitive Expedition.
El Paso, Texas, March 15.?American
troops were on Mexican soil tonight
60 miles west of here, the vanguard
of an expedition gathered in
less than a week, but nevertheless
one of the most powerful forces assembled
by this country since the
Spanish war. They were out on the
identical hills where one week ago
tc night Francisco Villa led 1,200 of
his bandits stealthily up to the American
border, to make an early morning
lush on the sleeping American city of
v-uiumous, rs. m., ana muraerea 1 '
Ameridans, eight of them soldiers, and
,ne a woman.
The elements of the armament of
this force, its numbers and the direction
or directions in which its various
columns headed after they passed the
international line were a secret held
by the military censorship.
The one important fact, that the
Americans had pone into Mexico
igain, was an event witnessed by hundreds
of spectators who crowded into
Columbus. They saw the troops move
off towards the imaginary boundary
line, until, when the men crossed, they
were tiny and distinct brown lines in
the distance in the clear Western air.
As the troops passed farther into the
low hills clouds of white dust covered
men and mounts as effectually as the
censorship. Behind the troops who
moved forward, new regiments rapidly
filled the vacated camps in Coumbus.
The Eleventh cavalry of Fort
Oglethorpe, Ga.. was one of the new
irrivals.
Other new regiments were expected
to follow but the officers would not
sav how soon, nor from what points.
The ; disposition of the First AeroraUvio
J .
Kiu?ut vii, ?iiiv.il passeu west
hare last night, loaded on flat
I one of the most interesting
Smtary movements, being the
Brat actual'campaign test of this new
arm of the service.
Unofficial reports came into El Paso
that about 50 miles west of Columbus,
near Haehita, N. M., another column
had gathered and probably had entered
Mexico. Nothing more definite
than the fact of this column's existence
was established, despite reports
that these troops might have gone in
first.
DEATH OF MRS. B. O. BERRY.
Mrs. B. O. Berry, of St. Augustine,
Fla., a native of Union county, S. ('.,
passed to her reward March 4, 1916,
after more than two years' lingering.
She leaves to mourn their great loss,
husband, two little children, Ann
Gretchen and Minnie Lee, two and
a half and six years old respectively,
three sisters and two brothers.
Services were conducted at the
First Methodist church by her pastor
and Rev. J. E. Oats of the Baptist
church.
Massey Lee Estes was married to
B. O. Berry at Carlisle, S. C., Oct. 2:'.,
1907. She was true to every relation
in life and a model Christian. She
leaves a record of fidelity to home and
church worthy of emulation. Oui;
glorified friend and sister had journeyed
upon the earth little more than
29 years. She left us in the fullness
of hope, and they that were by the
bedside felt they had followed her
to the gates of life. In the midst of
many sorrowing friends and loved
ones we laid her body away in beautiful
evergreen, but she is not there?
we know where to find her. Until
then let us be faithful. J. ('. Jones.

committee of the Southern Military
Camp League was held at thc Jefferson
hotel, at 1 o'clock p. m., Wednesday,
March 8th, l{)lf>.

from Barnwell county:
"Greetings to the executive committee.
Important engagement prevents
my being with them."
The minutes of the last meeting
vere read and approved. I
The chairman made a brief talk, in
the course of which ho reported the
orogress made since the meeting held
on January 27th, last, for organiza- '
tion. He stated that invitations had
been sent to all the counties in the
State, and that ir response thereto
gentlemen in 27 counties had accepted
appointment to the executive committee.
He also presented to the meeting a
list of the names of 25 gentlemen who
had enrolled to attend the camp at
Fort Oglethorpe, Ga., most of the enrollments
being from the counties of
Barnwell and Richland.
In the course of his remarks, the
general chairman emphasized the fact
that, while it was the hope of the
league to secure the establishment of
a training camp in South Carolina dur- j
ing the year 1917, there were two
things which would have to be done
before the authorities would seriously
consider such a proposal. The first
first essential is that we should give
evidence of our interest in the work
l?v sending a good delegation, at least
100. from South Carolina to the camp
at Fort Oglethorpe, and the second,
that some point in South Carolina
should be i unanimously agreed upon
for a camp site to be recommended to
the army authorities.
Mr. /. F. Wright, of Xewberry
county, offered the following resolution:
"Be It Resolved that it is the sense
of this mPotino* ihlif Cftlnmlil..
Carolina, should be selected and recommended
by the Southern Military
Camp Leajrue to General Wood as the
place at which a military training
camp should be situated in the event
that it is determined to establish one
in South Carolina."
This resolution was duly seconded
by Messrs. John T. Roddey. of York
county, and Mr. W. G. Sirrine. of
Greenville county, and adopted unanimously.
The chairman stated, as 'his was
the first meeting of the executive
committee, that the purpose of selecting
committeemen from each county
I was unmanly tnat me active work ?>f
the I.eague should he conducted in
each county by the committeeman.
As the present work of the league
is to stimulate interest in military
training such as is contemplated in
these camps, and to secure enroll
mcnts for the camp at Fort Oglethorpe,
he urged that each committeeman
should hegin actively and at
once upon this work. In response to
this Mr. W. G. Sirrine, of Greenvi'le.
offered the following resolution:
"Resolved, That the executive committeemen
hegin at once to secure enrollments
from their respective counties,
sending the same to the general
chairman for forwaiding to headquarters,
and that reports he made to ibe
