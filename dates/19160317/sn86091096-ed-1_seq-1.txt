Squirrel Poison
Made by Expert
Formula for Effective Squir
rel Poison Demonstrated
The preparation of poisoned
grain according to a formula that
has been found quite successful in
dc toying squirrels in this locality
was demonstrated at the Chamber
of Commerce meeting in Moscow
by C. M. Yerrington of the govern
ment biological survey, a specialist
on the destruction of animal pests.
Mr. Yerrington said that the
squirrel found here, the Columbia
ground squirrel, is one of the most
difficult to contend with. So far,
it has been possible to «et only
about seventy per cent of them,
but it is believed that their natural
enemies will do much to destroy
1the remainder.
It is not the purpose of the gov
ernment department of agriculture
to discourage or oppose the use of
commercial poisons. Its purpose is
to give the farmers the formulas
that have been found most success
ful in their own districts after
actual trial, and to recommend
only such preparation as can be
made at home.
Since the first trial of poisoned
oats were made, it has been found
that a mixture of wheat and oats is
more effective. The preparation
recommended can be prepared at a
cost of $1.50 to $2.00 per bushel,
and is said to be at least as good as
the best commercial poisons. Tests
are still being carried on at the
university farms, and any improve
ments discovered will be given pub
licity.
The formula recommended fol
' lows:
T~ Mix thoroughly one ounce of
strychnine alkaloid—not sulphate
(powdered) and one ounce of com
mon baking soda, (one heaping
tablespoonful).
2. Sift this into one pint of thin
starch paste and stir to a creamy
mass. The starch paste is made by
dissolving two tablespoonfuls of
gloss starch in a little cold water,
which is then added to one pint of
boiling water. Boil and stir con
stantly until a thin clear paste is
formed.
3. Add è pint (12 tablespoon
fuls) of any kind of syrup and stir
thoroughly.
4. Add 1 tablespoonful of glyce
rine.
5. Add J ounce (2 tablespoon
fuls) saccharine and stir well.
6. Pour this poisoned solution
» ........ r _________
over 20 quarts of grain, 10 quarts j
oats, and 10 of wheat, and stir un- j
til each grain is thoroughly coated
with a thin film of starch paste. If
the skin is not broken the hands
may be used in mixing. Wash
them afterwards. |
7. One tablespoonful of poison- j
ed grain should be placed at each !
burrow on a clean hard surface, j
allfL »ig the grain to scatter slight- ;
ly as it falls. (Placed in this way
it will not endanger livestock.) Do j
not put the grain on mounds or in
holes. Prepare 12 to 24 hours
fore using. Each quart of
poisoned grain should treat about 1
40 ho les. :
" J Mr. Yerrington explained that |
strychnine alkaloid, not the more i
common strychnine sulphate, is !
used because it is more powerful,
and is insoluble in water so that lt
stands exposure better and is taste
less when the squirrel first takes it
into the mouth. It is soluble in
blood, affecting the nervous system.
The small amount absorbed from a
few grains carried in the cheek
pouches is sufficient to kill a squirrel.
The soda has the effect of retarding
lne soaa nab uie cuai ux iciaiumg
the dissolving of the poison so the
victim will eat more of the grain
than if it dissolved more quickly
and was tasted sooner.— Star-Mirror

A Pathetic Story
Oldfield, the jeweler, rubbed the
rust from his Ford on Wednesday
morning and started out for his
"morning's morning" along the hills
and dells of the Potlatch. He saw
Billy, A. R. Shumaker's dog, by the
wayside and took the little fellow
in with him on the seat. It is Billy's
custom to jump out and run along
beside the machine when he is tired
of riding, so Mr. Oldfield tied him
to the machine with a short rope as
an extra precaution against these
regularly practiced death-defying
antics of the dog.
At a point, between the usual
rendezvous of the Ford and the
»piddle of the hill leading to the
school house, little Billy became
weary of riding so he leaped from
the seat to the ground for the pur
pose of accompanying the expedi
tion on foot. Imagine the little
fellows surprise when he felt the
tug of the restraining rope and saw
the cause of his present predica
ment! Upon seeing the Ford tied
to his tail with the rope, his dog
mind reverted immediately to the
days of his "pup-hood" when the
small boys were wont to attach cans
of the tomato variety to his hinder
most appendix. After a rapid men
tal review of past similar circum
stances, he decided that he was very
thoroughly "canned" indeed; and,
obeying his first impulse, he made
off for the brush along the tram-way
with the Ford still tied to his canine
continuation. We hope that BILLY
comes back!
Freight For Pacific Coast
Seattle, March 12.—Dispatches
from New York say that great
quantities of freight destined for
Russia are being shipped by rail
from the eastern coast to Pacific
ports because ships cannot be found
in the Atlantic to carry the goods
to their destination.
Five thousand loaded cars are
lying in the railroad yards in and
near Seattle awaiting opportunity
to i oa( ] their contents into steamers
or Vladivostok, and even larger
quantities of freight are stalled at
Vancouver, B. C. Every available
Earner is being chartered to carry
the frieght to Siberia, but the cars
come j n faster than they can be
emptied. Cotton, wire and knock
down cars are the principal articles
0 f freight.
The Oregon-Washington Railway
& Navigation company is building
grea t sheds here in which Russian
freight will be unloaded to release
the cars. The shipments promise

As this was the night set for the
Debating and Literary Society, the
general routine of business was taken
up, such as an unfinished business
and reports of standing committees.
When this form of business was
disposed of some one suggested they
all sing "My Country Tis of Thee,"
You should have seen the patriotism
demonstrated. Then there was a
call for reports of special commit
tees, and the report read on resolu
tions which was as follows:
Taney School District Resolutions
Whereas The Community has been
benefited from an educational stand
point, and The Goodfellowship and
Co-operative spirit has been fully
demonstrated to do larger and better
work, that would be a benefit to the

Therefore: Resolved that this
society follow up with an organiza

Committee, Miss Melville, C. O.
Sharpe, Fred Black.
When the committee concluded
there was great applause. A mo
tion was made and carried without
a dissenting voice, to accept the
resolutions as a whole. They pro
ceeded at once to elect officers for
the Boosting Club and their names
are as follows: N. E. Ware, Presi
dent, Perry Black, Vice-president,
Martin Lien, Secretary and Treasur
er, Miss Melville, Corresponding
Secretary.
Then came the adjourment. It
was promptly moved and seconded
that the Literary and Debating
Society adjourn.
Then that lunch ! It was whisper
ed "They never can feed this crowd,"
but the committee on refreshments
was equal to tb£ occasion and every
body was supped with plenty to
eat and the best of coffee.

The boys and girls of the High
School, and those of the upper
grades, over ten years of age, were
entertained Monday âfternoon by
Mr. G. E. Farrell of Washington,
D. C. and Mr. Potter of Idaho. Mr.
Farrell is United States Organizer
and Supervisor of boyB' and girls'
clubs. Mr. Potter holds the same
office for our own state. The pur
pose of their visit here was tol en
courage the organization of boys'
and girls' agricultural and home
clubs. Mr. Farrell was the princi
pal speaker and gave a very interest
ing talk. Some of the pupils are
thinking of organizing such a club
and Mr. Potter will be back in
about ten days to see what headway
has been made in that direction.
Mr. Farrell said he had found two
classes of boys and girls:—the
measuring worms and lightning
bugs. The latter are the ones whose
light flashes up an instant and is
gone; the former are the ones who
measure themselves fully and then
"hump" themselves. He then asked
the stucents which they would
rather be. "Measuring Worms"
was the answer so we expect several
enthusiastic agricultural and garden
clubs for Kendrick in the near fu
ture.

Basketball Game
The basketball game between the
upper and lower ends of town re

end. The game was a close one, the
final score being eight to seven.

broke up three minutes before time
was called for the simple reason
that the players were too tired to
continue.

Mill Dismantled
The sawmill at Bovard, owned by
Mr. W. N. Skinner, was robbed of
all its brass mountings sometime
during the past couple weeks. It is
presumed the idea was to sell the
brass for junk.
The loss of time and the expense
of refitting the engine will cost Mr.
Skinner probably several hundred
dollars. The profit derived from
the sale of the brass, to the unprin
cipled scoundrel who got away with
it, will net in the neighborhood of
five or six dollars. Any fellow with
enough brass to pull off a stunt like
this could cash in his available sup
ply at the present market price and
retire rich.
