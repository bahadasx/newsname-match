STATE BOOSTERS HAVE
MEETING AT HURON
BIG
E. P. DE MOULIN ATTENDS
WAS ONE OF THE BLACK HILLS REP
RESENTATIVES TO THE
STATE MEETING
President £. P. DeMoaliD, of the
local Commercial Club, attended a
meeting of the Black Hills Secretaries
Association last week at Rapid City
and following the adjournment of that
meeting together with G. O. Thorpe, of
Lead, J. K. Hall, of Rapid City, H. W.
Troth, of Deadwood, they departed for
Haron, where the State Builders and
Boosters Association was in progress.
That they created a favorable impress
ion with the people of the state may be
judged from the notices in the Daily
Huronite which says.
"Short talks, decidedly of a boosting
character, and urging oo-operation for
a good highway aoross the state to the
Hills, were next made by the Blaok
HUls delegation. This is composed of
representatives of the commercial
clubs of four Hills towns, aB follows
E, C. Thorpe, of Lead, ]. K. Hnll, of
Rapid City, E. P. De Moulin, of Hot
Springs and H. W. Trotb, of Dead
wood.
The towns of the Blaok Hills have
somewhat recently formed the organ
ization of commercial olabs referred to
above. They realize that the interests
of the Blaok Hillls in general are the
oomtnon interests of all the towns iu
the Hills and their intention is to boo
so hard that they will raise the altitude
of the highest point in the Hills at
least 2,000 feet higher.
They have the proper system, in fant
exactly the idea that the present meet
ing intended to bring oat in state-wide
form."
They were also instrumental in get
ting amendments added to the reso
lutions adopted by the Huron meetiog
a copy of which is given below.
"Whereas the various organizations of
South Dakota united in a oommon call
for a general meeting, the purpose of
which was to oonfer in regard to the
problems of development, and each
oall resulting in a great gathering of
allied interests with the one object in
view of building a still greater state
we, the members of snoh assemble
unite in organizing a permanent State
^Development League, and as a code of
principles worthy of the consideration
of the people of the Btate, and toward
whioh we strive we promulgate the
following declaration of principles
We believe that the land of South
Dakota is not surpassed in actual value
by the lands of any other state and
that present prices offer greater oppor
tpnities to the investor and home seek
er than can be found elsewhere, we
'therefore look with disfavor on our
land agents enoonraging South Da
kotans to look elsewhere for homeB.
We believe that greater oo-operation
should exist between city and oountry
-to the end that all may be benefited.
We believe that the tuslness of mer
chant and banker should be so manag
ed that consumers will find it advan
tageous to patronize them rather than
mail order houses or financiers with
out the state.
We endorse the work of all oo oper
ative farmer organization bin thair ef
forts to improve conditions relative to
the sale and distribution of farm pro
duots by oo-operation of produoers.
We favor an effeotive system of in
speotion and grading of grain by the
Federal Government,
We favor government ownership and
oontrol of storage elevators for grain
in terminal markets and the extending
of Government credit on storage cer
tificates.
We favor a larger sale of state lands
to actual settlers at a price proportion
ate to other lands and a reduotion of
interest on deferred payments to four
per oent per annum.
Ocean carrying charges having ad
vanced from an average of 12 68 per
ton in 1910 to $30.00 per ton in 1916 and
fluctuating to such an extent as to
make it impossible for shippers to
know in advance the cost that the pro
ducer will have to stand for each trans-
portstion, we record ourselves as un
reservedly in favor of a merchant ma
rine owned and controlled by the gov
ernment.
We urge farmers to make a thorough
J,
If* „f
ja
We appreoiate the great work done
by railway corporations in opening up
new oountry and in aiding the pioneers
in oaseB of distress. We believe that
the interests of suoh corporations and
of the state will be benefited by favor
able rates to home seekers and urge
that during the ooming season the
greatest inducement possible be offer
ed those who are looking to the we6t
for homes.
We depreoiate and disoourage any
advertisements of the state and its re
sources other than those th^t state
exact faots.
We favor an amendment to the con
stitution, authorizing the state to
come to the rescue of the people in
case of atmospherio calamity.
We favor the use of home products
in the industries of the state.
We look with disfavor on the state
and oounty officials purchasing sup
plies outside of South Dakota when
goods of equal value can be bad at no
greater oost within the state.
We earnestly request that during the
last week of April, the papers of the
state issue Appreciation and State
Bailding editions, reviewing the work
of their respective communities for the
past year, giving facts as to production
of grain, live stook, dairy and other
produots of the soil, relating the pos
sibilities and advantages of., that par
ticular locality for the home seeker,
inviting him to visit the state and in
vestigate its unsurpassed opportun
ities. We urge subscribers and adver
tisers to encourage this by liberal pat
ronage and to aid in giving suoh
edition wide circulation in other states.
That the week may beoome one of en
lightenment of the people of South
Dakota as to the resources of the state
of whioh they are a part as well as one
of advertisement to the world, we oall
upon commercial clubs and other civic
organizations, sohools, colleges and
ohurohes to hold public meetings ad
dressed by oitizens and participated in
by the pupils, reviewing the past, con
sidering the present and looking into
the future. We designate suoh week
as "South Dakota's Appropriation
Week" and oall upon every loyal citi
zen at all times and especially duriug
this week to intelligently, truthfully
and enthusiastically hold up this great
state as a haven for home seekers, a
land of opportunity.
Education is an essential of enlight
ened, prosperous and progressive peo
ple and believing that the oountry boy
and girl can the better get that edu
cation in the consolidated school,
record onre^lves as urqaaliflertly in
favor or consolidating rural schools
so that a high school education may be
given the boy and girl in the oountry
while they remain on the farm—the
best place on earth to raise a boy or
girl.
We hereby endorse the work of the
state Immigration Department, and
recommend a substantial inorease ap
propriation by the legislature.
As a means toward the growth of a
greater South. Dakota, we favor state
wide prohibition of the liquor traffio.
We also favor the passage of the
amen ment to the State Constitution
submitted to the voterB by the special
session of the legislature, for the rati
floation of the voters at the next gene
ral election next November, providing
for a state system of rural credits and
the acceptance of federal aid for postal
roads, and urge the united efforts of
the Commercial Clubs of the state and
the oo-operation of the newspaper?,
for the education of the voters of tfce
necessity for suoh amendment.
We recommend the adoption of the
proposed amendment to the State Con
a'.ltntion, being submitted to the
voters, providing for the organization
of irrigation districts, bearing their
own expense, as a progressive step for
the development of our.state resources,
and urge all newspapers, commercial
clubs, business men's olubs and voters1

voters of the state at the next general
election in November: J. W. Parmley

STOCK MEETING:
FOR H0TMNGS
WESTERN SOUTH DAKOTA STOCK
GROWERS WILL MEET HERE
DATES APRIL 10TIHITH
TWO DATS PROGRAM WILL BE AR
RANGED—BIG CROWD OF STOCK
AND COMMISSION MEN COMING
The first convention for Hot Springs
in 1916 will be the Western South Da
kot Stook Growers Association whioh
meets here April 10th and llth and at
that time will hold their twenty-fifth
annual meeting.
All previous meetings have been held
at Rapid City, and all efforts to make
any ohange have been promptly and
effectively voted down. However, the
range stook business has experienced
searious reverses, several succeeding
years of drowth, the settlement of
practically every portion of the range,
necessitated a material reduotion of
the large herds and caused the retire
ment of many of the meu who had
pioneerd the business and made possi
ble railroads and aotoal settlement and
advancement of the country. Fifteen
to eighteen years ago this organization
was one of the strongest and most in
fluenzal in the state and assisted in
many ways to populate and p-otect the
natural advantages of thatsco ion lying
west of the Missouri river. The
southwestern portion of the open
range oountry has every reason to have
a pride in this organization as Hon. H.
A. Goddard, of Fall River oounty, was
the first president and F. M. Stewart,
of Caster oounty, the first and present
secretary. Every stockman of the ter
itory lying west of the Missouri river
and adjacent territory should attend
this meeting and by their presenoe as
sist in re-uniting aud fostering the in
terests whioh have always been and
will continue to be the principal faotor,
direotly or indireotly in the upbuilding
of this western country and especially
wet-tern South Dakota.
One reason for ohanging the meeting
place of the association this year is to
try and instill new life into the asso
ciation. Wyoming until a few years
ago always met at Cheyenne and it is
an organization over forty years old,
Abont five years ago they started the
movement of having the meetings at
different points in that state and since
then the membership has increased
very myterially and is now again a
flourishing orgarizition with larger
membership than ever before.
