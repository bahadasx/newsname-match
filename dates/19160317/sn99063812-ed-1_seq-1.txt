Issues General Warning
(Herald Special Service)
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 17.
The department of agriculture has re
cently received letters from a number
of farmers who have subscribed for
stock In rural-credit companies, In
cluding so-called co-operative compa
nies which appear to have no real co
operative features.
In some of these letters the com
plaint Is made that the agents selling
the stock make misrepresentations as
to when, loans may be obtained by
subscribers and that the companies
later disclaim responsibility tor the
statements made by the agents. In a
number of Instances farmers seem to
have gained the idea from the agent
that they would be able to secure
loans within a relatively short time,
and express disappointment on realis
ing that they must watt for an Indefi
nite period for the promised loan and
go on making payments Just the same
on the stock which they have agreed
to take.
