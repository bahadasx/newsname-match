the seven aviators from Columbus, N.

who visited Columbus told of prac

ary to their soaring southward today
to aot as scouts. Their bomb dropping
ability was to be restricted for the
present, owing to the large number of
Carranza troops In the Casas Grandes
country also on Villa's trail.
That Colonel Dodd's flying squad
ron of cavalry may be too late to cut
off Villa's retreat to his secret hiding
places in the Sierra Madres, was indi
cated in a report from Agua Prleta
that Villa already had crossed over in
to Sonora. This was considered a pre
inpfure rumor here. Carranza cavalry

Reports from Presidio, Texas, in the
"Big Bend" country east of here, told
of renewed bandit raids by Villa

It was reported that thousands of

EL PASO, Texas, March 17/—
Swallowed up In the foot Mils and
deserts of northern Mexico, the Unit
ed States expedition of two divisions
was seeking Villa today while its
movements were screened by an al
most impenetrable censorship.
Desertions of Carranza soldiers
throughout Chihuahua also are re
ported, although: no specific act of
opposition by Carranaista troops
against the American expedition has
yet been confirmed.
The rumored revolt of the QJInaga
garrison and the assassination of its
commander have ibeen officially de

Snipers, presumably Villa sympa
thizers, fired on a Texas and Pacific
railway train near the alfalfa switch
east of HI Paso, but no one was In

Is no confirmation of
reports that snipers have picked off
members of the American expedition

expeoted to withhold details of fight

While Carranza soldiers were aotlng
as scouts and otherwise keeping with
the expedition, General Gevlra, com
mandant in Juarez, stated that Ameri
can trooops would not be permitted to
garrison any Mexican titles or towns
during the, pursuit of Villa.
General Bertani, placed in com
mand of the Carranza pursuit in the
Galenal district, where Villa was last
reported seen, Joined his cavalry at
Casas Grandes today. Civil authori
ties inclined to doubt the sincerity of
Carranza's cooperation and asked
why the United States troops were
not permitted to use the Mexico
Northwestern railway from Juarez to
Guzman or Casas Grandes instead of
being forced to make the terrible
march across the Chihuahua desert.
The sand of the Mexloan plains was
retarding the progress of the Colum
bus division. The heavy wagon trains
were finding it difficult to keep np
with the cavalry advance. The United
States Infantry, despite years of serv
ice on border patrol duty, were en
countering difficulties on the treach
erous sands with the midday intoler
ably hot afoot.
lieutenant Derosy O. Cabell, chief
of staff to Brigadier General J. J.
Pershing, was reported to be directing
the Mexican and American cavalry
scouts. Cabell knows the Chihuahua
country, and its difficulties perfectly
from his experience In the pursuit of
the Indian Geronimo In 1886. Cabell
advised taking the infantry on the ex
pedition for tile hot fighting expected
when the American troops corner Vil
la In the mountain fastnesses.
If Villa escapes the net the United
States and the Carranza troops are
slowly drawing around him he was
expected to hide in the Sierre Madres,
in which he has so far proved inap
proachable. Fighting from behind
rocks and across deep canyone, the
Villlstas are expected to hold off
many times their numbers. They have
ammunition and supplies hidden in
the hills.
The American aeroplanes will bo
balked by the Villlstas hiding in the
mountains, according to cattlemen
"who know the Chihuahua country.
Absence of trails will render the
American mountain artillery Useless,
they declared, and cavalry and in
fantry most face on foot a foe who
gives no quarter.
It Is already costing Qie United
States government $90 a minute to
hunt Villa, or 572,000 a day. This
estimate was made today by Major
William Elliott, quartermaster. Mil
lions may be expended before the
threat of Mexican banditry against
the border states Is completely wiped
out.
Additional troops reached Columbus
throughout the day from interior posts.
Ammunition, food stuffs and train

The Villa spy scare continued to re

have been wounded. He was held on

the Ooftumbus raid. Among the usual
crop of reported Villlflta outrages,
was one brought by Sam Hess, an
American refugee, wiho stated he saw

off the only other remaining member

Pearson, suggesting that Dublan had

IXMfDON, March 17.—The slopes of
Dead Man hill are strewn with the
bodies of thousands of German and
French dead, cut down in three days
of fierce fighting, northwest of Ver

The plateau has earned Its sinister
name, dispatches from both Paris and
Berlin agreed today. The slaughter
on the northern ridge where Silesian
troops gained a footing, has not been

around Donaumont and Vaux.
Paris and Berlin reports today con

counts of the struggle for Dead Man
hill, the bulwark of the French Mnes
west of the Meuse. The French war
office, after first denying the Berlin
claim that Sileslans captured the po

German assaults against the plateau
and announced that the Teutons have
been driven off to the north. The
Berlin statement, somewhat vague, re-.

on the border should be sent to Jolh
the advance expeditions. Whether
congress shall be asked for immedi

was also to he considered.
It was Indicated that requests for
money from congress would be post

longth of the Villa expedition can be
forecast.
Sweeping aside all other business,
the house plunged into the prepared

reorganization bill. Leaders and the
rank and file were united in a pro
