INTERESTING POLL FOR THE
CHOICE OF CANDIDATES
Tho election this year is more
vital (o the Btnto of Now Mexico
than was thoeleellonof JOU. This
v'oar. Now Mexico will ha onllod
tipon to cast hor voto (or the state
and county officer and for presi
dentlal electors
The ropublirati leaders are at
work. Tim deinocruts are not
working, so far as anybody knows
Tho porsnnnel of the republican
ticket is now generally known. No
ono has the slightest Idea who wit)
be named by the democrats for uny
position on their ticket. They are
as sheep without a shepherd lea
derloKS and not specially concerned
when they talk of the election next
fall.lll is with i lie optimism of peo
pie who have not analyzed u situa
tion, but bcllovo, somehow orother
they will win When a possible no
mination for nnv one of the loading
places on the ticket Is mentioned,
it is usually some man who would
stand no more chanco of election in
Now Mexico than he would of flyin
to me moon aim dock on the same
day. Usually ho would bo all right
as a democratic nomlneo In Taxus
or Mississippi.
Nothing is being dono to promote
an inBurnictlon in the republican
party, such as mado possible the
partial success of tho democrats in
1011. Tho movement led by for
mcr Qovernur Hugermnn, former
Governor Otero, former Attorney
General 1'rlohard, It. II Hanna, W
11. Gillenwater, and tho powerful
Uaynolds fumlly, to say nothing of
n host of republicans in other sec
tlona of the state, cost the rcpubll
oati candidato for governor tliinia
amis of votes and added thousands
to tho voto of tho democratic can
dldsto. It was a powerful Influence
on tho entire ticket.
For oxAinplo, W. C. McDonald
hid a plurality of 1408 in the conn
tics of Hernalillo and Sundoval.
ThoByrnptoms uro that tho plurality
this year for the republican cnnili
uaio lor governor win do quito as
much, thus making a difference of
approximately 3,000 votes in t lioso
two counties alono. What are tho
democrats doing to prevent thlr
slump or to offset it?
The tickot nominated by the re
publicans will not be easily beaten
at the polls, Elections in New
Müxlco are not exactly the same as
Hoctlous in Iowa or Kansas,
and because candidates nominated
here would not bo strong In an east
erh'stftto is no reason why they
would nos bo voto-getters here.
In Jaensurlng candidates for office
wo5o not use exactly tho same
stajpjard, that is supposed to be
employed in Ohio, for example.
Without the slighest prejudice
forfjhem or against them, oa com

CARRIZOZO, LINCOLN
merlcal will prevent the nomination
of Holm 0. Uursum for irovornor
and Frank A. Ilubbell for United
Slates senator. For Hernandez
thero will be no opposition in tho
convention Let it bo said here
that u careful survey of tho situation
la Now Mexico falls to find o strong
er republican trio for tho positions
Hursum is far strongor than he was
fivo yoars ago, and there is no indi,
cation of a rovolt against him. Cer
toinly some of tho most powerful
influences in indopondont republican
movement against him then will bo
for him now.
frank A Ilubbell will hold tho
bulk of the Anglo-American repub
licon vote. He will get the repub
Ileon nativo voto, and, unless the
democrats put up the strongest
man they can find, ho will got quiti
a percentage of tho nativa demo
cratio vote. On that point there
Is no need for delusion Thoro Is a
roco sentiment in thli ststo that is

aro Spanish Americans. If you will
study the composition of tho various
counties of Now Mexico, it will be
seen that about one half of the
normal democratic vote is Spanish
American. As "La Revista de
taos" said of Ilubbell, "wo consi
der him ono of us " That Is the
native view of it
And the race feeling on the part
of the notives is not without some
sort of justification With more
than half of the voters in the stnte,
they found when they came to size
up the results of tho first state elee
tion that every nativo who ran
against an Anglo Atnorican of any
politics was boaten Tho result
was that the Anglos had the gover
nor, two United States senators,
two members of congress, three
members of thosupreme court, three
members of tho corporation com
mission, the attorney general, the
treasurer, the auditor tho suporlli
tendeut of public instruction, elcht
circuit judges, seven district altor-
neys, unci the natives had it lieuton
ant governor, thosecrotory of s'ato
and ono district attorney.
Was It to be wondered at that
when tho opportunity come. In !UM,
there was a decided raco feeling dN
played in the congressional oleotinn?
1'he race feeling is still there, and
tho party that falls to recognize it
can havothofun of running what
ever fun may be had out of a cum
paigu (loomed, in the very nnturo
of tiling, to defeat.
Still, the democrats havo a chanco
to put up a ticket and make an or
ganlzation that would win over any
ticket tho republicans might put
In tho field Hut If they are tn
win they must stop running in cir
cles, stop fighting among themselves,
and get down to business
