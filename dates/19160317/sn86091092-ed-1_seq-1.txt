Director* Reject Application of Notus
Settler* for Adnucsion to Project—
Representative of Secretary Lane
Notifie* Director* That he is on
Ground and Ready to Investigate—
Charges Based on Smith Report.
C. R. Trowbridge, the representative
sent out by Mr. Lane, secretary of
the interior, to investigate conditions
on the Boise reclamation project, ar
rived in Boise Monday. Mr. Trow
bridge informed the Boise Water
Users' association Tuesday at a meet
ing of the board of directors of the
association, that the investigation
would be started Wednesday morning
at Boise.
The board of directors appointed i.
committee consisting of Messrs. C. M.
Rankin, J. L. Magee and E. Sparks to
confer with Mr. Trowbridge concern
ing all matters to be taken up in the
investigation and to urge upon him
the advisability of holding the hear
ings at Caldwell. The change from
Boise to Caldwell is deemed advisable
because the witnesses all live near this
city.
Badley Charge* Subject.
The first matter that will be taken
up by Mr. Trowbridge will be an in
vestigation of charges that were made
against John Badley, formerly con
nected with the Reclamation Service
on the Boise project. These charges
were filed against Mr. Badly several
years ago and were investigated by
C. G. Smith, who filed his report some
nine months ago with Comptroller W.
A. Ryan. This report is alleged to
have been suppressed by persons in
high authority in the Reclamation
Service.
Taking the Badley charges as a
starting point i}, is hoped that this in
vestigation will go into the affairs of
this project in a most thorough man
ner. The settlers on the project are
convinced that a thorough investiga
tion will disclose some startling trans
actions.
Rankin Visit* Washington.
C. M. Rankin, a director of the
Boise Water Users' association, was
convinced that the Smith report had
never come to the attention of Mr.
Lane. He was sent to Washington by
the board to interview Mr. Lane and
petition him to make an investigation,
After listening to the plea of Mr. Ran
kin and looking ov*r his evidence the
secretary of the interior decided that
an investigation was badly needed. He
informed Mr. Rankin that a représent
ative would be sent out. In compli
ance with this statement Mr. Trow
bridge is on the ground.
Mr. Rankin returned from Wash
ington the latter part of last week. At
the meeting Tuesday he made verbal
report to the beard of directors of
his visit to Washington,
Committee Will Rest on Report
The committee of the Water Users
association rest their case on the re
port of Mr. Smith. They will ask that
this report be placed in evidence and
an investigation be started from the
report. Trie committee will ask that
Mr. Smith be sent to CaldwelJ: that
the hearings be held in this city in
stead of Boise. The Water Users
are of the opinion that the move is up
to Mr. Trowbridge. They are satis
fied with the Smith investigation so
far as the charges against Badley are
concerned.
Black Canyon Resolution Rejected.
The directors of the Black Canvon
district presented, through J. B. New
port, the following resolution which
they asked this body to adopt:
Resolved, That in contemplation of
the appropriation of the surplus watei
that may be found to be available In
the Boise project by Arrowrock and
Deer Flat storage, and the reclamation
of additional lands whereby the acre
age of the Rois« project may be en
larged thereby reducing the cost of
water to the water users, we recom
mend. jf it be found more feasible am'
economical from the standpoint of
construction and maintenance, that the
surplus water be diverted to. lands
north of the Boise project, known as
the Black Canyon project.
Messrs. T. B. Newport, Win. Lemon,
B. M. Holt knd W. S. Hawkes spoke
for the adoption of the resolution,
while Director Wood spoke against it
and in favor of extension work on the
south side. A motion was made to
table the resolution and, on roll call,
five voted to table and four against.

CANYON DEMOCRATS IN
FIGHT TO THE FINISH
Will Support Any Good Democrat as
Against Nugent for Committeeman.
The Democrats of Canyon County,
headed by Mr. P. E. Smith, are in the
tight against the Pence-Nugent-Elder
ring and will stay there until the finish.
They will support any good Democrat
who shows up. Mr. Frank Martin,
former attorney general, is a favorite
for the position of national commit
teeman.
The Democrats of Canyon county
approve of the action of the Ada coun
ty organization in providing for a pre
ferential primary election. It is likely
that this county will follow the action
taken by Ada county.
Mr. Smith, local leader of the anti
Pence-Nugent-Elder faction, is con
fident that his faction will win. He
states that the Democrats are in the
fight to the end, and that any good
Democrat is acceptable.

Wonderful Interpretation of "Carmen"
at the Bungalow Tuesday, Mar. 21
Lured to America by William Fox
from the Theatre Antoine de Paris,
the French capital's playhouse of
thrills.
Leaped into instanneous fame in this
Country by her blood-chilling redition
of the part of The Vampire Woman
in the William Fox production of "A
Fool There Wa«," by Porter Emerson
Browne.
Her subsequent career under the
William Fox standard a success of
unequalled triumphs. Now literally
the rage frpm coast to coast; the en
tire country at her feet.
Is a screen home-wrecker. In her
wake only blasted lives and stunted
careers.
Says brunettes are less cold hearted
and calculating than blondes, despite
that the popular idea of a wicked wo
man is a dark and midnight beauty,
Her eyes possess the velvety bril
liance which is r.sually associated with
Cleopatra, one of the earliest Vam
pires of history.
_ Is tall and willowy, moves with the
sinuous grace and audacious beauty
of a crimson, fu'l-petalled rose.

"hired man" likes
both generations
ra.
The Hired Man was walking down
the street one day last week when he
was met by Grandpa Morrow, one of
the patriarchs of this region. Next,
the Hired Man ran into old brother
Bowman, who was just that day,
March 8th, celebrating- his eighty-sec
omd birthday. Then the proud straight
old gentleman, Mr. BaJl stepped along
down the street, and when he was told
of father Bowman's birthday, he
smiled broadly and remarked that it
he had fifteen years more on top of
his own age he would be just one
hundred. In their early man
hood these old men never heard of
the auto, the telephone, th'e x-ray, the
airship, the cookstove, the gas lamp,
the electric light bulb, the sardine,
the fish hatchery, the linotype, the gas
engine, the disc harrow, the steam
thresher, the mowing machine, the
header, the binder, appendicitis, tuber
culosis, the paste diamond, the 21
jewel watch, the pyorrhoea, the grip,
shredded-wheat biscuits for breakfast,
the slitted skirt, the pink teas, the
movies nor the street fountain. Away
back there when these patriarchs
were in their boyhood, peop>le got
their lads one pair of shoes to the
year, sometimes, and they made them
last. They had sugar or syrup on
Sundays, and the boy who talked back
to father wished lie better hadn't.
When a man said he would, he did,
and when- he said he wouldn't, he
didn't. Whiskev was good and no
body cared much about it. The liar
got into society rather slowly and the
girl didn't think much of herself if
she kept company with a fellow who
got drunk. May the blessings oJ the
years yet rest on these old men who
are among us still. Too soon they
will grace our streets no more. From
the joy of visiting a few moments
with these three, and tour or five
others of their kind that day, the
Hired Man was carried incidentally
where the little four-year-old tot of
Mrs. W. R. Wilkerson was the ad
miration of a parlor full of people,
while she, all unconscious of her
beauty and attractiveness, was the
leader of a group of children carried
away with her angelic frolicsomeness.
She was playing mother to other and
older girls. The Hired Man slipped
a little pointed question to her about
what she would do if some of her
children became naughty, and she re
plied if the worst came to the worst
she supposed she would have to whip
them. Fate appearing to be on my
side that day, once more at evening
Mrs June Grimes came in to see Col
onel Clay, where I chanced to be for
the hour, and with her was Stanley,
the handsomest of all handsome little
two-year-old laddies. Scarcely old
enough to talk, he is alert, inquisitive,
bright, keen as the keenest kutter 2
edecd sweet and lovable, broad ir

Light of Day.
Why did C. R. Trowbridge come to
Idaho? What did he accomplish?
These two questions are agitating the
settlers on the Boise government rec
lamation project. In IS minutes yes
terday morning at Boise Mr. Trow
bridge concluded i his investigation.
Presumably he packed his grip in the
afternoon and is now en route to
Washington.
The committee appointed by the
Boise Water Users' association, con
sisting of Messrs. C. M. Rankin, J. L.
Magee and E. Sparks, were at Boise
Thursday in response to the following
notice:
To Whom it May Concern:
Pursuant to instructions of the Hon
orable Secretary of the Interior, the
undersigned will hold a public hearing
at Boise, Idaho, in the office of the
Reclamation Se-vice, commencing at
9 a. m. March 16. 1916, for the purpose
of affording an opportunity for all per
sons interested to make known any
charges against the conduct or action
of John E. Badlev while employed in
the Reclamation Service.
C. R TROWBRIDGE.
Boise, Idaho, March 14, 1916.
The committee, with their attornev
T. E. Buckner, and Mr. Badley with
his attorney, met with Mr. Trow
bridge. Mr. Trowbridge stated that
the attorneys would not be permitted
to enter into the proceedings. He then
asked for the charges against Mr. Bad
ley. The committee stated that the
case against Mr. Badley was in the
Smith reoort. The report itself con
stituted their case and thev wanted i'
brought into the investigation. Mr,
Trowbridge did not care to, could not
or at least did not produce the Siuitn
report. The committee did not care
to prefer new charges against Mr
Radley. They took their stand on the
Smith report and are determined __to
stay right there.
Smith Report Secret
The now famous Smith report is to
be keot covered uo. The entire Ree
lamation Service, from Secretary Lnne
Hown, is determined that the damning
Smith report will never see the lieht
of day. As the things with which
Badley is charged occurred upwards
of five years ago the senselessness of
Starting over ie apparent. Witnesses
h.-.ve gone to the four winds; evidence
has been destroyed. In face of this
the secretarv of the interior wishes to
ignore the Smith report and start all
over in hopes anparentlv that no case
can be made against Badley at this
time.
No Investigation.
There can be no investigation—no
arrival at the facts—unless the Smith
report is taken as a basis. The attempt
to cover up is not deceiving anvone,
and it is remarkable that Mr. Lane
secretary of the Interior, through hi
representative should stoop to such
tactics. The investigation, alone th
lines attempted by Mr. Trowbridge
was nothing mo-c than a farce.

Mr. E. H. Plowhead reported that
the immigration committee had taken
up with state officials the conditions
surrounding the sale of state land to
be held here April 22. An effort was
being made by the local committee to
induce the state land board to sell all
of the state land in the government
project at the coming sale and not to
confine it to applied for pieces, Mr.
Plowhead declared. The contention
of the local people is that the recla
mation service has issued lists of the I
lands to be sold including a statement
that all would be sold whether ap
jlied for or not. and that the land
joard should sell the lands as an
nounced originally. .....

The Hazelwood people have found

they found the supply non-dependable, I

Each year hundreds of thousands of
