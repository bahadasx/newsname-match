IRRIGATION AND CREDITS
CONFERENCE ENDS AT SALEM
State Capitol, Salem Another ses
sion of the state credit conference
doubtless will be called within th
next few month to adopt th form in
which th proposed constitutions
amendments Indorsed by the conven
tion, which closed here Saturday,
shall be submitted to th people.
Meanwhile two committee will
work in conjunction with th sttomey
general on th drafts of th proposed
measures thst are to place th pro
posed amendment in operation.
If a majority of th committeemen
determine that their work should be
reviewed by th wbol conference be
fore it goes before the people, the con
ference will be called together again.
When the meeting adjourned
jority of th delegate seemed to ex
pert a future meeting.
Sine th convention now hss deter
mined thst it wants two separate
measures . one providing a system of
rural credits and th other providing
stat aid for irrigation and drainage
th committees hav their work defi
nitely outlined for them, and th rest
of the delegate are hopeful that har
mony at a future meeting will replace
the friction that, waa so apparent in
the session of th last few days, car
rying both Issue to a successful con
clusion at the polls. '
Th convention, so far a carrying
out th purpose for which It wss
called together, virtually concluded its
work Friday night. By remaining In
ion until 1 o clock In th morning
the resolution expressing th policy
of th conference finally were adopted.
Th session wss devoted to th
tail of creating two committees that
shall hav charge of th preliminary
legislative work. It also waa intended
aa sort of a harmony meeting, but
there wss harmony only in the s
ing attempt of both factions to drift
farther apart.
So th belief is pretty general that.
after an interim of a few months, th
delegate will hav had Um to forget
their minor difference and that they
ill b ready to unit in their deter
mination to conduct an aggressiv snd
eo-operstivs effort to enact th pro-
nosed amendments into lsw.
Summarised, the work or in con
vention Is about as follows;
An amendment to th constitution
enabinr the stat to lend It credit to
a rural credits system wss proposed.
An amendment to the constitution
enabling th state to use It credit for
irrigation and drainage waa proposed.
Th bond to be eojd under either or
both of thee plana are not to exceed
in , th aggregate t per cent of the
assessed valuation of ths state.
A committee consisting of J. D.
Brown, president of the Farmer'
Union: C E. S pence, master of th
Stat Grange, and T. H. Burchard,
president of the State Federation of
Labor, waa appointed to work with th
attorney general in drafting th pro
posed constitutional amendment for
the rural credit plan.
A. L. Mills, chairman of th conven
tion, wa authorised to appoint a com
mittee of three members on drain
age man and two irrigation men to
work with tne attorney general in
drafting the proposed constitutional
amendment for atot aid to irrigation
and drainage.
Th committee also will hav pow
' to draft th proposed initiative
measures that will carry the proposed
amendment into effect; and to call
another convention if necessary.
"So far aa possible" the committees
are authorised to co-operate.
The convention closed ss it had pro
ceeded from the start divided de
cisively on one issue, thst of linking
rural credits with stats aid.
The delegate from the State
Grange, the Farmers' Union, the Ag
ricultural College, the State Univer
sity and many from Western Oregon
were firmly united in their determina
tion not to permit th state aid plan
to be linked with the rural credits
plan. They were proponent of rural
credits but did not want to "swallow"
irrigation in order to get it.
They were championed on th floor
of th convention by Thomas B. Kay,
state treasurer, and at some stages of
the voting hsd the delegates from the
State Federation of Labor with them.
They had an abundance of oratorical
talent besides the state treasurer, not
ably Judge W. M. Colvig, pre resent
ing the Southern Pacific; Senator S.
M. Garland, of Lebanon; W. H. H.
Dufur, of the Grange; A. R.Shumway,
of the Farmers' Union; E. J. Stock,
of the Labor Federation, and others.
Governor Withycombe voted with
them when he waa in th house.
On the other hand, the Irrigationista
and most of th drainage people, to
gether with a large proportion of the
Portland delegation, stuck together in
support of the plan to combine the
three issues. '
This division wss plain throughout
the meetings. One break cam when
Mr. Stack, of the Labor Federation,
joined with Asa B. Thomson, Oswald
West and W. Lair Thompson in sign
ing the original majority report of the
resolutions committee providing for s
combination of the three measures.
Mr. Stack explained that he did this
to permit this plan to come before the
convention on it merits. On subse
quent ballots he voted with th fsction
supporting the separation or isaues.
, When the morning's meeting tried
to organise a committee to draft the
proposed legislation. Senator I. N.
Day, C C Chapman and others of
those who had supported the omnibus
plan proposed a single committee "in
the interests of harmony."
But the other side objected even to
this. They even went farther and in
sisted n naming their own committee
to draw the rural credits bilL
