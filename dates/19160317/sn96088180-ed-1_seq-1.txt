i 1 .
London, Mar. 17 Halted by . a
withering tire west of the Meuse, the
Germans resumed their drive against
the northeastern Verdun, forts with
smsshlng attacks on the village of
Vaux and Fort de Vaux, Paris re
ported today.
Preceding their attacks, the Ger
mans unloosed a terlfflc artillery Are
upon the French trenches. " Then reg
iments ot Brandenburg, who won so
much glory In the fighting at Douau
mont. emerged from ravines In which
they had been concealed east of Vaux
and attempted to scale the heights of
Fort de Vaux.
Long before they could reach the
crest of the -300-foot alope a storm
ot shells ploughed through their
ranks from cannon fired at close
range. They were mowed down by
scores. -: ;
Indications were that the slaughter
of Brandenburg would be the equal
of that which occurred ten days ago.
Berlin told of repulsing two French
attacks against German positions on
"Dead Man's" hill. In the first the
French ran forward steadily, In spite
of a mathematical fire which killed
or mangled men at every step. Only
a few survived the terrific German
fire and reached the parapets, When
they got there so few were left that
they could do nothing but Jump Into
the German trenches and surrender.
A second attack launched along
the path of the first wss even more
disastrous to the French, Berlin said.
German guns shattered the French
ranka before the charge gained any
momentum, leaving only a few
wounded to crawl hack to shelter.
El Fnao, Mar. 17. If Carranzlstas
do not win the race to see whether
Mexicans or Americans shall capture
Francisco Villa, tho United States
forces must follow him to his favorite
haunts In mountainous western Chi
huahua.' This was made evident today by
reports from the advancing "front."
While Brigadier-General Pershing's
troops were lahorlug through the
dust and heat of Chihuahua deserts,
Villa and his followers were said to
have arrived In tho forbidding moun
tains ot San Buena Ventura district.
Familiar as Villa Is with the wild
Sierra Mad res west ot central Chi
huahua, having roamed the country
as an outlaw since his youth, ob
servers forecasted la long guerilla
campaign, with bloody night raids by
the bandits upon American camps.
News ot the unopposed progress of
two American columns toward Villa's
retreat was sent to San Antonio by
the government's wire, but El Paso's
official reports were restricted to
stories ot unofficial attempts to get
400 American Mormon Bottler refu
gees put of Mexico.
After arrangements had boen made
for a train to. go In after the Mor
mons, while another train was sche
duled to start northward ... carrying
part of th Americans to safety, both
plans were upset by Mexlrans cutting

cial announcement here. , ,
' Major-General Frederick Fnnston
Issued a bulletin stating that no cas
ualties bad' been suffered ' by the
Americans, and that so far the scouts
had' failed to locate any Yilllstas. '
One hundred Carranza scouts and
an army aeroplane are being used in
the effort to find Villa, it' was stated.
Army headquartera were still ap
prehensive with regard to the atti
tude of Mexican peons, who; Ignorant
ot the expedition's real nature,' may
see In it a "gringo" Invasion of Mex
ico and fight accordingly.
"I note certain dispatches state no
Carranzlstas are co-operating with
General Pershing's column," said
Funston today. On the contrary,
about 100 are with him. They are
not part ot General Bertanl's forces,
but were connected with a subordin
ate body which met Pershing at Las
Palomas after his men had crossed
the border. Bertanl was not there
then, and did not personally meet
the American column."
The report that Colonel Herbert J.
Slocum had offered $50,000 for
Villa's head was not confirmed,' and
was regarded as erroneous. Slocum,
it was stated, had no authority to
make such an offer.
Increasing excitement among Mex
icans at Harllngen, Tex., was noted.

the Twenty-sixth TJ. S. Infantry, does
not regard the situation alarming.

Douglas, Mar. 17 With 700.000
rounds ot ammunition here waiting
transportation to Governor Calles of
Sonora, ranchers arriving from Naco
zarl today expressed doubt as to the
loyalty of Calles' troops in that re
gion. ' "
"' They discredited rumors that Vll-
lUta bands were heading for Cabul
lona to Join Carranzlstas mobilized
there, who have been reported In a
mutinoua mood.
Should Villa escape to the Sonora
side of the Sierra Madrea, an Amer
ican expedition against him, starting
from Douglas, was' considered a pos
sibility. The forces at Camp Douglas
could move on an hour's notice.
Douglas has been placed under the
most strict military censorship, the
same as that enforced at Columbus.
Newspaper correspondents were pot
on their honor not to send out on
censored dispatches, even It they de
vised methods of "beating the cen
sor.".'' ,v-.V

cavalrymen have been sent to guard

dent Wilson united to reorganize the

strength. It, provides tor an imme
diate increase in the number of
Uncle Sam's lighting men. ,.
Army preparedness bills are ready
for consideration by both the upper
and lower houses. ' A cabinet meet
ing is scheduled to consider whether
additional border forces Should be
mobilised, and whether congress
should be asked for immediate emer
gency appropriations to pay for the
present expedition and provide tor
the 20,000 army recruits authorized
under the Joint resolution.

of both these requests would be post
poned until the extent ot the cam
