The conference of business mon,
physicians, educators and others on
social and moral hygiene, was attend
ed by a very satisfactory audience.
Mayor Morton was called to the
chair and stated the object of the
meeting. .
Ho Introduced Dr. L. 0. Hons, who
read a vory Interesting paper relut
Ing to the general BeriouHtiess of
private diseases and their effect
upon the Individual and home.
Dr. W. 1). McNary, superintend
ent of the Kastorn Oregon State Hos
pital for the Insnno, gave nn epitome
of the great per cent that uro con
fined In that Institution as a result
of unnamed diseases.
Dr. Culvln S. White of Portland,
spoke at considerable length of his
experience, the treatment and evil
resolts of contracted and Inherited
diseases. He Is a member of Direct
ors of Oregon Social Hygiene Society
and presented the objects of the so
ciety as follows:
The Oregon Social Hygieno Society
alma to provent some of tho dread
conseiinences of wrong sex practices
by teaching the nature of sex life de
cently, aa part of the common knowl
edge which all should have for self-protection.
This society emphasizes the belief
that girls heed knowledge of Uio du
ties of motherhood and of the
changes which their bodies must paBs
through to prepare for those duties.
It urges that such knowledge be
furnished In every household, by
every mother to every daughter. It
believes that the bond between
mother and daughter will be
strengthened by proper advice about
the sex life of the growing girl and
that knowledge may be tho means of
keeping the girl pure, and of shield
ing her from the dangers that sur
round all growing girls.
Every boy needs definite, decent,
understandable instruction In sex
matters. All boya have doubts, fears
and worries about themselves. From
twelve to twenty the boy Is growing,
merging from boyhood Into man
hood. His mind and body are dis
turbed by new sonsationa and new
experiences. There are many things
he wants to know about hlmaolf, but
dares not ask of those older and
wiser, because he Is Belt-conscious
and ashamed. He should be properly
taught, and It Is tho duty of parents
to teach him.
If parents find It difficult to give
Instruction at thla critical period, the
Oregon Social Hygiene Society Is
ready to help, by means of literature;
or, through the AdvUory Department
of the State Hoard of Health, boys
may obtain personal advice given by
carefully solocted mon who have
given much time and Btudy In prep
aration for thla work.
M. E. Miller gave some suggestions
on "What Can We Do for St. Helens."

YOU WILL HAVE TO
HUSTLE TO WIN
Plnno Contest Will Hose Woriiiemlny,
Mnrrli 2I
If, when you do a kind act, you
should futally wait for the gratitude,
you might thereby miss the oppor
tunity of doing another, and falling
to get what you have foolishly de
sired, Iobo all the Joy of life, or, hav
ing got It, lose the other chances of
being satisfied. Best keep on try
ing, then; what Is done for others
you have dono twice for yourself, for
what Is your end and object than
happiness, which never follows
greed ?
A piano Is never a foolish posses
sion. Every time you spend a dollar,
put It some pluce where you can get
a vote coupon and then turn it over
to your chosen candidate. You won't
bo the only one doing this, and how
do you know but that your little help
will turn tho trick and put the prize
where you want It? You people who
net out of yourselves once In a while
and do something for somebody else,
are beginning to learn the true secret
of a happy life, and once you get in
tho way you will keep It up forever
you will speedily see that the mll
lenlum Is no fickle dream, but a
blessed reality, to be brought about
by Just such simple means.
No U80 to shout about the virtue
of the piano or other prizes. All
have become familiar with them.
Now Is tho time for Bteady, deter
mined effort, the kind that wears and
tears and makes character in the
doing. Every one et these contest
ants, who have been working for the
prize, will be the better for tho effort,
oven though there is only one piano
and only one who can get it.
Who Is to be the one? Thnt Is to
bo the momentous question. Do they
at times see a vision of the dray
stopping at their door, the men un
load, tramping into the Iiouho with
the beautiful instrument, the re
ward of their proweBs and endeavor.
Hear In mind some of the contestants
whom you would llko to see a winner
and then go out and work.
Remember that eight of our lead
ing merchants aro interested in this
contest and give 25-vote coupons
with every dollar's cash purchase to
tlioao who ask for them.
PYTHIANS ENTERTAIN
Recently Avon lodge, Knights of
Pythias, one of the strongest frater
nal orders in tho city, made two
teams do the Initiatory work the

team. To get expert Judgment on the
respective merits of the two teams,
which held a competitive trial Tues
day night. Judge Morrow, circuit
Judge of Multnomah county, Past
Grand Chancellor Commander Frank
3. Graut, Grand Keeper of Records
and Seal Walter Gloason, accom
panied by two old time members of
the lodgo, Dr. H. It. Cliff and N. A.
Perry, visited the lodgo and presided
as Judges. Tho decision of the Judges
was that it was a tie, which was the
most diplomatic Judgment thnt could
be arrived at. Afterwards the guests
and members of the order to the
number of 60, wero treated to a well
prepared supper at tho Orcadta hotel.
Ross, A. S. Harrison and II. E. La
Hare, was made pormanent.
The organization is associated with
the State Hoard of Health and de
rives its financial support In part
from tho state.
An equally interesting meeting for
adult women wag held in the city hall
Thursday afternoon, uuder the au
spices of the Oregon Hygiene So
ciety. The meeting was addressed
by Mrs. Lola G. Baldwin of Portland.
Her theme was "How Shall I Tell My
Child."
Her appeal to mothers was: "Do
not permit tho school teacher to take
your Job away from you; the teach'
er'a Job 1b to educate; the mother's
Job Is to 'Mother' ". Continuing, the
spoaker said: "The best way for a
mother to gain and retain the sweet
and pure confidences of her daughter
is to lot her hear from her mother's
Hps tho truths concerning the seorets
of 'life', Mothors, do not tell your
children lies to quiet them when they
ask these delicate questions,"
JUSTICE PHILIP
HANDS OUT JUSTICE
Violators of Prohibition Uw Come
to Grief
Shorlff Stanwood arrested Peter
Hanson and Gordon Goheen and they
were arraigned before Justice Philip
Thursday of lant week. Hanson was
charged with maintaining a nuisance,
by permitting parties to drink in his
place of business. He plead guilty
and was fined in the sum of $25.00
and costs. Gohaen was charged with
giving away liquor and he also plead
guilty and contributed $10.00 and
costs to the county exchequer.
Sometimes the prohibition law Is
Innocently violated. It seems that
Goheen had received the UBual allot
ment and went into the meat market,
purchased bologna and retired In a
back room to enjoy himself. This
made tho proprietor guilty of main
taining a nuisance.
R. H. McGruder and Antone
Iiricks of C'latnkanle, were arrested
on complaint of a representative of
the Oregon Humane Society, charged
with cruelty to animals by permitting
cattle to starve to death. It is claimed
that from 30 to 40 head out of a
herd of 600 have already died. They
plend not guilty through their attor
ney, and the trial will be held at
some future time.
Geo. Fowler of Rainier, was or
rested at Deer Island by Sheriff Stan
wood, charged with taking liquor to
a dance. He was brought before
Justice Philip Monday. He plead
guilty but would not divulge where
ho procured the liquor, and there
fore the court placed his fine at
$50.45, which Included costs. Sheriff
Stanwood is determined to put a stop
to the Illicit salo of liquor and viola
tors sliould beware.
BOYHOOD FRIENDS
MEET IN ST. HELENS
F. T. Lldyard was the Sunday
guest of his brother, W. E. Lldyard,
and while here vluttod the shipyard.
He wns introduced to Capt. Wright
son of Mobile, Ala., who is having a
ship built In the yard here, and as
soon as he heard Mr. Lidyard's voice,
he recognized him as a boyhood
friend In England. In their youthful
days they were rivals, but it re
mained for Capt. Wrlghtcon's brother
to capture the girl. Tho meeting,
after nil these years, was indeed a
happy one.
This reminds us that the world is
not very big after all. Here boyhood
friends meet after a lapse of more
than a quarter of a century, thous
ands of miles distant from their na
tivo heath, clasp hands again on an
island in tho mighty Columbia.
PRICE OF FISH
The Columbia River Fishermen's
Protective union liac announced the
prices for raw Chinook salmon to be
charged canneries during tho season
to open May 1, at 6 cents a pound
for fish weighing under 25 pounds
each, and 7 Vt cents a pound for fish
weighing 25 pounds or over.
This is an increase over the rates
prevailing last season, but the mem
bers of the union assert the increase
Is warranted by the condition of the
market. The prices paid last year
were 6 cents a pound for small or
cannery fish and 7 cents for larger
cold storage, the new rate being an
advance of one-half cent per pound.
The union has reduced the dividing
point between large and small fish
from 28 pounds, tho 1915 mark, to
25 pounds.
The packers will meet in the near
future to consider these prices.
FISHING SEASON CLOSED
Until May first, when the spring
soauon for fishing opens, the fishing
industry is closed. Manager Ballagh
of tho Columbia Hiver Packers' Asso
ciation, states that on account of the
unusual high water in both .the Co
lumbla and Willamette rivers, that
the winter fishing season has not
been so successful as he anticipated.
The fishing industry means much to
St. Holeng and tho Mist hopes for a
successful and profitable season
when tho spring soason opens May
first,
REGARDING COST OF
HARD-SURFACING
(By C. E. Spence, Master of the State
Grange).
A few years ago the Grange took
the position that road building Is In
the experimental stage and It was
unwise to go the limit and bond fu
ture generations for hard surfacing
when in a few years we might be able
to build a better road for less money.
Now at least one of the Advisory
Board and he did all he could to
further the program of the "State
wide Highway Committee" four years
ago says he Is thankful that we did
not go into the road building business
on a wholesale scale till we have had
the opportunity of learning from the
experience of California. He now ad
vocates a concrete or cement base
covered with a thin coating of bitu
lithlc, not more than halt an Inch
thick, and which has the advantage
of being easily repaired. This is get
ting pretty close to the Grange Idea
of concrete roads, but not at the pres
ent prices of cement. That must be
cut In two before we can afford many
miles of cement roads.
There Is Bmethiag else we have
learned in the meantime and not
mentioned by the gentleman, and
Which is equally important. Multno
mah county paid the contractors at
the rate of $1.17 per square yard for
two inches of bltulithic on the old
macadam roads. Oregon City is hav
ing four inches, twice as much as
Multnomah county, placed on Its
macadam streets for 75 cents per
square yard. And now comes Marlon
county with a record of 87 cents per
square yard for four inches, 15 cents
of that is for royalty for the machin
ery, leaving a net cost of 52 cents a
square yard.
In other words, Oregon City get
for 37 cents what costs Multno
mah county $1.17. Marlon connty
gets the same thickness for 34 cents.
Including a royalty. Marion county
did Its own work by days labor. All
contractors' profits were eliminated
except the royalty. The patent pave
ment people say that the Oregon City
and Marlon county pavements Is not
as good as theirs. At any rate they
use the same brands of crushed stone
or gravel, sand and asphalt. One can
not distinguish a difference without
taking "bltulithic treatment." So it
Is evident that the taxpayers of this
state saved millions of dollars when
they refused to bo carried off their
feet with the hardsusfactng and bond
ing craze. Score one for the organ
ized farmer and laborer.
EVERY VOTER
SHOULD REGISTER
Every voter In the state of Oregon
must register before the close of
business, April 18, 1916, if he wishes
to vote at the Primary Election to be
held May 19, 1916.
Failure to re-reglster before April
18, will preclude him from voting at
that election.
And since one of the first duties of
good citizenship is to vote, It be
hooves every one to have his name
appear In the new register.
Therefore, REGISTER NOW! and
remember, no previous registrations
count.
DELIGHTED VISITORS
Judge and Mrs. M. G. Morrow of
Portland, were visitors In this city
Sunday. They drove down the high
way In their auto. Justice Philip
took them in hand and made their
visit pleasant and interesting. The
Judge expressed a desire to see the
Interior of the court house and both
he and Mrs. Morrow were charmed
with the magnificent view and the
convenient arrangement of the vari
ous departments. They were also
shown through the Masonio hall and
were loud In their praise of Its room
and many conveniences. In fact,
they were much taken with the at
tractiveness of the city, the hand
some bungalows perched on the hill
where Mrs. Morrow said she would
like to live, and the grand view pre
sented by the magnificent snow
capped mountains and the mighty
Columbia.

other one built Just like her.
A double shift of mechanics will
be employed in building the Ruby
this week. Her completion is to be
given every possible dispatch. Telegram.

WANT TO BE JURORS
At a conference held in Portland
by the Oregon state W. C. T. U. a
legislative committee was appointed
and instruction given Its members to
draft and present to the next Oregon
legislature a bill placing women vot
ers upon an equal footing with men
as regards jury service and another
measure prohibiting the sale of cig
arettes within the state.
Advocates of the woman-Juror
measure asserted that men had
proved themselves unfit to act as jur
ors in certatn cases where attractive
women were on trial or where they
figured otherwise as parties at inter
est. It was declared that such
alleged evils would be remedied It
women served as jurors.
