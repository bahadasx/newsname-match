RAILROAD WILL
MOVE DIVISION
Says Col. Sam Owens, Who Has Been
Buying Property Desired by Q.
& C, Near Bowen.
Notwithstanding the vigorous de
nials of the Danville Advocate that
the Cincinnati Southern railroad has
any intention of changing the divi
sion point from Danville to Bowen
and Junction City, Col. Sam M. Ow
ens, who has been a special agent
of the road for a number of years,
stated here Monday that the railroad
company has all plans made for the
removal. Mr. Owens conducted ne
gotiations with the property owners
in the section of Lincoln county af
fected, and has secured favorable
deals with all with the exception of
one, through whose lands condem
nation proceedings may have to be
instituted. Mr. J. F. Russell, of the
Bowen section, brought blue prints
showing the property acquired by the
railroad to Stanford Monday and ex
hibited them at the I. J. office. The
blue prints were made by the rail
road's engineers from headquarters
at Cincinnati.
In talking of the matter Mr. Owens
said that the railroad had finally de
termined to make the change and
that one of the chief reasons there
for Avas the inhospitable manner in
which it had been treated by the peo
ple of Danville generally, a large
suit having been filed against it there,
property desired for enlarged track
age having been held at exorbitant
figures, and the water supply having
proven such that the railroad officials
believed much more satisfactory ser
vice could be secured by operating
its own plant on the Bowen site. Of
course, the Danville papers may de
ny all this, but Col. Owens knows
whereof he speaks, and his long ser
vice for the railroad and the fact
that it entrusted him with the busi
rss of securing options on the prop
Jy desired proves that he is in :t3
dflPkdence in this matter. In a re
cent issue, the Advocate took occa
sion to deny a story in an earlier
issue of the I. J. concerning the ru
mored removal of the division, in the
following language:
It is true the Danville papers have
paid no attention to this matter be
cause they investigated and found
there was nothing to it. Hardly a
week has passed since the division
came to Danville several, years ago
that a report was not started tnat it
was to be moved away In a very
short time. At one time the Som
erset papers went so far as to name
the date when the division would be
returned to that place. That was
three years ago. If all these reports
had been true the officials of the Q.
& C. Route would have had to quit
doing commercial business and de
vote all the time to moving. The In
terior Journal recently printed an ed-.
itorial to the effect that the division
was to be moved on account of the
lack of water supply in Danville. To
the people who know there could not
be a bigger joke. Danville has wa
ter sufficient to more than supply the
whole system from Chattanooga To
Cincinnati. The company some years
ago put in a big electric pumping ap
paratus in Danville where there is
plenty of water to pump. After test
ing out the proposition the railroad
company disbanded their own plant
and took the city water for two rea
sons first because it is more econo
mical; second, because it is free of
all sediment and does not clog up the
boilers in which it is used. The In
terior Journal further stated that
land could not be gotten here except
at fabulous prices. The railway offi
cials have been assured not less than
fifty times that they would be .fur
nished all the land they wanted when
ever they wanted it. Danville dona
ted $35,000 merely to have the
Southern Railway extend its line
from Harrodsburg to Danville. It is
preposterous to even think for a min
ute that the division would be per
mitted to move away for lack of land.
The road will be furnished all the
land it wants here, of which fact .all
the officials are well aware. The sur
vey at Bowen is merely for the en
largement of trackage for surplus
cars and switching for the junction
at Junction City. The Advocate
would have paid no attention to the
comment in the Interior Journal but
for the fact that Editor Saufley
seems to be taking the wild rumor
as a serious matter. It has never
been so taken in Danville, but mere
ly as idle rumor, similar to the hun
dreds of rumors that have been start
ed from time to time.

High School News
The Domestic Science Department
seems to be accomplishing much. The
Seniors have recently finished mak
ing dresses, and the Junior girls have
made waists. The Arts and Craft
display was held in the domestic sci
ence room, and although ony a few
attended, many interesting and beau
tiful articles were on display. The
D. S. Class of Stanford donated many
samples of hand-work.
The members of the eighth grade
and high school will be permitted to
attend the lectures at the court-house
Friday afternoon.' This will be an
interesting program and should be
well attended by the patrons.
Due to the above fact the Literarv
Societies will be held on Thursday
afternoon.
Rev. P. L. Bruce conducted the
chapel exercises Monday morning,
which was enjoyed by all.
Miss Esther Burch was unable to

Crack of the Bat.
Last Monday saw the athletes ca
vorting on S. H. S. fiield and altho
it was the first afternoon out sev
eral of the boys showed mid-summer
form. The only work they were per
mitted to engage in was chasing flies
in the outer gardens.
Although two stars, Wood and
Coleman, of last year's team were
lost, S. H. S. still claims to have
"some" team and many games will
be played this season. A few of
those out for practice were: J. Cash,
Spoonamore and "Tubby" Martin,
who will put up a lively fight for the
receiving honors; Gover and Rein-
hart, both of whom have shown bril
liantly on various occasions will as
say to battle for the slab honors;
Sam Embry will cover first base;
Clem Hill, who demonstrated his abil
ity last season, will take Captain Em
ory s place at second; Walton, a man
of much experience will cover short;
toward third base no one dares to
cast his eyes since "Home-run" Per
kins has expressed his intention of
covering the ladies' corner; Shanks,
lead-off man for the team last year
and who bids fair to be in that po
sition again this year, was chasing
fungoes in mid-summer style. Noe,
who lead the team in fielding with
1.000 and batting with .600, was pull
ing them down with one hand, and
covering a great deal of ground; last
but not least, Joe Embry, the never
muff guy, was catching them in ev
ery manner possible and shows that
no one can beat him out of his place.
Tucker was also sacking some hot
ones and will give someone a hot
fight for a place. Others who are
expected to make the regulars go
some are Hutchings, H. Gash, Wel
burn, Matheny, Tanner, Garman and
B. Hill. Coach Spragens, who hails
from Georgetown, will endeavor to
teach Ehe boys baseball as well as
lessons, and hopes with the material I
on nana to have a pennant winning
team. Any team wishing a game
will please write W. C. Wilson, prin
cipal, or Hartwell Shanks, student

and Libel Suit in Texas C
Corpus Christi, Texas, w te the
Evangelists Ham and Ramsey went
after conducting their great evange
listic campaign at Danville, was
turned topsy turvy by the work of
these men, and at an election held
immediately afterward voted out sa
loons by a majority of 300, notwith
standing the fact that the liquor in
terests had previously dominated that
city at previous elections. Several
complications grew out of the revival
conducted by the Ham-Ramsey forces
in the Texas city, which are of in
terest to the thousands in this sec
tion who heard them at Danville. A
well known lawyer of Corpus Christi
attempted to horse-whip Rev. Ham
in a hotel, and a later development
of the revival came when Frank B.
Harrison, correspondent at Corpus
Christi, Tex., for the Associated
j Press and several daily newspapers
in Texas, brought suit against twenty-one
local business concerns, three
corporations, a national bank and
five pastors of city churches, asking
$50,000 damages for libel growing
out of a signed protest dispatched to
officers of Associated Press regard
ing a story appearing in certain pa
pers under a Corpus Christi date line
as to features of the Ham-Ramsey re
vival services being conducted there.
The story complained of was to the
effect that the revivalists, the Rev.
I Mr. Ham and the Rev. Mr. Ramsey,
had been arrested in connection with
certain charges they had brought re
garding the existence of crime in that
city. This story was in error, the re
vivalists not having been arrested,
but only served with subpoenas to
appear before the county grand jury
to give testimony regarding the exis
tence of crime in the city on which
they had based the charges made
publicly from the pulpit. Believing
Harrison had sent out this story, the
revivalists and certain business men
of the city drew up a scathing protest
denouncing Mr. Harrison and for
warded this protest to officials of the
Associated Press.
In his petition Harrison alleges
that he did not send out the story
! complained of; did not know that it
had been sent out; that the attack on
him is unwarranted and that his rep
utation as a newspaper man and cor
respondent has been greatly dam
aged by reason of this protest.

mother, brother and sisters, as well
as to his wife, the deepest sympa

will cause you to laugh away half
your troubles. So everyone come
and enjoy yourself, and feel young
once more.
