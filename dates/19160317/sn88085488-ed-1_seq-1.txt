VOLUME XXVIII
MARTIN SALE BRINGS
HUNDREDS TO PULLMAN
AH Merchants Report Record Break*
ing Sales us Result of Attraction
Provided by "That Implement
Man"
The big auction sale and barbecue
conducted last Saturday by T. C.
Martin proved a greater drawing
card than a full grown circus, and
Pullman was literally crowded with
humanity from early in the morning
until late at night. Vast throngs
crowded Grand street in front of the
Martin headquarters, while Col. J. B.
Hicks reeled off buggies, hacks,
wagons, and other vehicles until the
entire lot was disposed of. The ve
hicles all brought fair prices, the
total sales amounting to something
over $3000 and in many cases the
bidding was spirited. The value of
the big event as a drawing card was
indicated by the fact that many farm
ers used four horses to a hack or
light wagon to bring their families to
town, the roads, especially west of
PuHman, being in almost an impass
able condition. Not only did Martin
himself get a record breaking crowd,
but all the stores were crowded with
liberal buyers, and the "movie"
shows provided much entertainment
for the women and children. Some
of the merchants report bigger sales
than were recorded for the market
days of last summer and fall.
The Martin barbecue, which had
been advertised far and wide, left
nothing to be desired by the inner
man. Martin had 1000 paper plates
on hand on which to pass out his
beef, beans, pickles and other trim
mings, but was forced to get addi
tional plates, nearly 1100 persons,
including men, women and children,
partaking of the feed. Owing to the
threatened Inclement weather, the
outside barbecue was dispensed with
and the beef was roasted hi huge
chunks by 11. M. Beck, who also pre
pared the beans, and the eagerness
with which the main items on the
bill of fare were devoured proved the
ability of the bakery man as a chef.
CHAMBERS WILL BUILD
William Chambers is having plans
prepared for a one-story brick build
ing on his lot south of the Flatiron
building. The new structure will be
approximately 40x75 feet, and will
be used by the owner as a general
produce establishment. Mr. Cham
bers will make a specialty of flour,
seed grains, feed and general pro
duce. It is expected that work will
commence within a few days.
AUTOMOBILE SALES
Pour Ford automobiles and two
Buicks were delivered by the T. C.
Martin agency during the week, the
new Ford owners being Bert Hately,
Walter Hately, V. I. Knapp and Lee
Allen, the three former taking tour
ing cars and Lee Allen buying a
roadster for delivery service. W. L.
Greenawalt took delivery of a Model
D<s3 Buick five passenger touring
car, and George McCroskey became
the owner of a Model D 65 Buick
roadster.

And uiiii dew from his eye often wet It.

Fresh and fair as the, daughters of Eriii,
Whose smiles can bewitch, whoso eyes can command.

A LITTLE BIT OF HEAVEN
Have you ever beard the story of how Ireland got its name?
I'll tell so you'll understand from whence old Ireland came
No wonder thai we're proud of that dear land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old mother told the tale to me:
"Sure, a little bit of Heaven fell from the sky one day
And nestled on the ocean in a spot bo far away;
And when the angels found it, Bhure it looked so sweet and lair.
They lid, 'suppose we leave It, for it looks so peaceful there':
So they sprinkled it with star just to make the shamrocks grow,
'Tis the only place you'll find them, no matter where you go
Then they dotted it with silver, to make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished, shine they called it Ireland!
'Tis a dear old land of fairies and of wond rous wishing wells,
Ami nowhere else em God green earth have they such lakes and dells
No wonder that the angels loved its shamrock-bordered shore,
'Tis a little hit of Heaven, and I love it. more and more.

SHERFEY NOT GUILTY
IS VERDICT OF COURT
.Mooted Hog Case Foiled When .Ins
lice Henry Finds J. I'). Sherfey
Not Guilty on Larceny Charge
The mooted bog ease was brought
to a close in Justice Henry's court
last Saturday when that worth)
found J, E. Sherfey not guilty of lar
ceny following a trial of the ease.
sherfey was represented by Attorney
John w. Mathews and Prosecuting
Attorney K. M. Burgunder appeared
for the state. The ease- was featured
by much contradictory evidence.
The case grew out of the seizure
by Sherfey of three pigs, which he
claimed were his own property. He
went to the farm home of J, W.
Hampton, north of Pullman, and
loaded the porkers Into a wagon,
bringing them to town, Hampton at
once coin plained, and the warrant
charging larceny was issued at his re
quest.
Sherfey claimed that the pigs were
bis by reason of an agreement en
tered into with Hampton at tin- time
the latter moved onto the farm va
cated by Sherfey. According to Sher
fey story, which was corroborated
by witnesses, he left the farm, the
two men agreeing that each would
take one-half the expected litter of
pigs. He claims that the pigs were
denied him by Hampton, but that be
took them. Hampton declared that
the agreement concerned only the
second litter of pigs, and that he
(Hampton) was to keep the entire
first litter. The testimony favored
the contention of Sherfey, who was
promptly acquitted and permitted to
retain the pigs.

Thomas Eaton, Jr., died last Mon
day at the family home on .Methodist
hill, following an illness of long dur
ation. Death was caused by tuber

NUMBER 22
SPOKANE INDIANS
TO TRAIN HERE
Pullman Fans Will Have opportunity
j l«. S«>« lyenguo Players in Pre-
season Action— Will Use
Rogers Field
Pullman baseball fans interested
In the race of the Northwestern
league teams for the coming season
will have an Opportunity to see the
Spokane Indians, contenders for the
pennant, In their pre season training,
arrangements having been practical
ly completed for the entire squad of
Spokane diamond stars to spend their
two weeks training period In Pull
man. While the time has not been
definitely settled the Indians will In
all probability be here for I hi' sec
ond and third weeks in April, when
they will be granted use of the ex
cellent diamond on Rogers field and
other facilities necessary.
The training period here is
planned to come simultaneously with
the workouts of the Washington
State College squad. The profes
sionals and the Northwest college
champions will train side by side on
Rogers field and it is expected that
the college players can receive much
additional Insight into the finer
points of the game than would be
possible were they to train alone.
The shower bathe and gymnasium
apparatus, in return, will be placed
at the disposal of the leaguers nad
the facilities available' at the college
are undoubtedly much more com
plete than could be secured else
where. Nick Williams, veteran star
of the diamond, who will manage the
Indians this year, has given assur
ance that his players will do every
thing possible to assist the college
team in the race for the conference
championship.
The Spokane team has been al
most entirely reorganized since last
season, when they appeared to have
the championship of the league
cinched, but lost the title on a disas-
Irons road trip. The line-up this sea
son includes but three members of
the 1916 team.
The Washington State College
squad, on the other hand, has 16
members of the 1915 squad and
about (6 new candidates, bringing
the number of aspirants to 60. In
view of the fact that the W. 8. C.
players won Ihe conference cham
pionship last season, the number of
players back In school speaks well
for the chances of grabbing the title
for 1916.
While they are here the Spokane
Indians will play the college men a
number of pre-season games on the
local diamond, In addition to practic
ing with thin dally. In all probabil
ity the leaguers will also play the
university Of Idaho team a couple
of games, which will throw some
light on the relative strength of the
W. S. C. and Idaho teams.
In addition to the games with the
Indians the collegians will meet the
American Giants (colored) from Chi
cago before the season starts. The
game was scheduled to be played on
Rogers field on April I, but it is
hardly likely that it can be staged so
early. The Giants played on the local
diamond two years ago and put up a
classy brand of ball, winning from
the W. S. C. team by a score of 4
to 1.
Tin- series of pre season games
with the professional teams is ex
pected to fit the W. S. C. team to
enter the conference championship
race in tip-top condition.
GARLAND FINED
IN POLICE COURT
A. C. Garland, an employe of the
N. P. lunch counter, was fined $5
and costs, a total of $8, by Justice
Henry Wednesday evening when he
pleaded guilty to a charge of assault
upon the- person of John Elliot, an
Italian bunker hand. Elliot, accord
ing to Garland, called the latter a
vile name in a dispute over money
matters, when he was assaulted by
Garland. Garland paid the fine rath
er than contest the case. Following
the trouble both men went to the
home of Judge Henry and, asked that
the matter be settled as soon as
possible.
