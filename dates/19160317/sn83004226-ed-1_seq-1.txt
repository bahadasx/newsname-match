BIG BOOM ON IN

Big' Plant For Manufacture of Gaso
line to be Built.
The little town of Kermlt, one of the
busiest and most prosperous In the
county, is soon to have its fame ex
tended. Situated In the great Marrow
bone gas Held, where great develop
ment Is In progress, the little city is
advantageously located and Its growtn
during the past year has been very' auu-
srantlal. In addition to the gas mows
try the growth of the community re
cently haa been Increased by the mam
moth plant of the Hutchison Lumber
Co.. on Wolfe creek. There quite a
suburb ia springing up.
Recently' tho United Fuel Gas Co.,
said to control practically nil of the
gaa output of the Marrowbone Held.
haa commenced the erection or a vast
nlant bv meaiia of which gasoline Is
extracted from the gas. Just what the
output of this plant will be Is not yet
known but it Is snlllclent In sixe to
take care of all the gas pumped from
the field.
Hy a certain process gasoline Is ta
ken from the gaa without Injuring or
Imparlng the gaa In any way. What
gasoline thua secured IB clear profit to
the company, less of course the cost
of operating the plant
In addition to gaining this by-product
the gas, after the gasoline has
been extracted la much more easy to
transport. Aa It hos been up to this

BIG ADVANCE IN
CATTLE AND IOCS
WITHOUT PRECEDENT IN MANY
YEARS, AND DISAPPOINTING
TO THE PACKERS. "
Chicago, March 10. Phenomenal ad
vances have been shown In the cattle
and hog markets this week.
No auch spectacular hog trade-as the
preaent has been witneased since the
spring of 1 St 10, when semi-famine sup
ply condition existed and $11 20 per
cwL waa paid at Chicago. That mark
et stimulated production all over the
country, resulting In the largest pig
crop ever produced in 1915, on which
packers had baaed expectancy of a
$5 DOW 6 trade during the preaent win
ter. Liquidation of light stuff during
December, owing to the failure of the
corn crop In many localities, forced
pricea down to $5 75 to $6 25 per cwt.
at that Juncture, but with the turn of
the year rapid enhancement occurred
and between the December low spot
and the high apot this week the mar
ket advanced about $3 50 per cwt. un
der the Influence of the hottest compe
tition ever witnessed at the stockyards, j
On the low day last December top hogs
sold at $6 50, and the average price was
6. On Thursday of this week the top
was $9 80 and the average $9 68, with
the $10 top quotation reasonably cer
tain to develop before the week end.
Thl phenomenal advance occurred
during a period of heavy receipts at
all market prior to March, and fur-
nlshea growers with a convincing dem-
onatratlon that the day of cheap hogs
Is over, both beef and mutton were
high, and the masse went to pork,
which, coupled with an abnormal for
eign demand for pork products and an
excellent Industrial situation, made the
advance irreslatable.
Almoct Spectacular.
The advance In cattle has been al
most aa spectacular during the List
three weeks as has that In hogs, and
many in the trade are atill puxaled as
to how It happened.
The advance In hogs, eliminating
cheap pork a a comtietitor of beef,
waa undoubtedly an uplifting Inlluence
and the fact that liquidation had run
lta course bus furnished a tonic, aa has
the reopening of the Btocker and feed
er outlet, at Chicago, through which
competition haa been broadened. One
Item not to be overlooked ia that win
ter beef making In the EruL has been
on a limited scale, necessitating heav
ler drafts on Western markets to sup
ply the populous Fast with beef, a con
dltlon likely to exist until grass be
comes a factor, and any considerable
supply from that source is some di
tance away.
For a year past territory east of
Chicago haa been liquidating cattle
and replenishment has been neglected
for many reasons, the principle ones
being disease and Inability to buy thin
cattle at Chicago, the logical market
for that region. With corn-belt feed
lots partly empty and the Southwest
ern beef crop short present prices look
legitimate.
Live mutton trade haa been conduct
ed on auch remarkable high-price ley-
els all winter, and particularly since
the turn of the year, as to forestall any
such sharp advances in recent weeks
as have occurred In the cattle and hog
trade.
The Advance in Cattle.
A clasa of decent to good qualities,
thin, light ateera 4hat aold at $5 60 to
$6 40 on the February low spot made
$7 to $7 85 on the crest of the rise this
week, such cattle now getting both kill
er and feeder competition. Cannery lit
tie "rag-tall" steer have gained less.
They were then selling at $4 60 to $5,
and are now making $5 25 to $5 75.
Fleshy to half fat warmed-up 1.000 to
1,200 pound steers that sold by the
thousand on the February low spot at
$6 50 to $7 25. have gone to a $7 75 to
$8 65 basis generally and In some ca
ses the appreciation Is even more. The
$7 25 to $8 grades on the low spot lust
month are now making $S 65 to $9 15.
Top grades have gained less, though a
lot of strictly good to choice heavy-
steers have sold at $9 25 to $9 To that
could not beat $8 50 to $9 25 at the low
time, and the top this week, as last, has
been $9 B0. Buyers are reluctant to pay
$10, but eventuully It must come.

Leslie R. Drake, of Central America,
walked past Central Park, and point
ing at the benches and fountains be
neath the trees said:
"Twenty years ago I sat In that plaza,
on a bench and I had neither a place to
sleep nor anything to eat. I waa a
tramp, and as I sat there looking up
at the sky I planned on how many
beefsteaks I would buy if I had $1,000,
.000." Mr. Drake neglected to say that ac
cording to Dunn and Bradstreet, he ia
to-day rated at more than $1,000,000.
but he did say that now he had enough
money to buy all the beefsteaks be
would want for the rest of his life.
Mr. Drake has made his fortune in
Central America, but he does not ad
vise others that they may hope to do
likewise.
KENTUCKIANS IN
HUNT FOR VILLA.
Many Kentucklans soon will be hot
on the trial of Villa, the bandit who
led his forces Into the town of Colum
bus, N. M., a few days ago and mas
sacred seventeen Americans.
Lieutenant A. W. Gullion. of the
Sixteenth United States Infantry, Ra
tioned on the Mexican border and who
was formerly commandant at . State
University, a Newcastle boy, who left
yesterday for the scene of the man
hunt, said Kentucky Is well represent
ed In all regiments In service in and
around the territory where Y1'1 W'U
be pursued.
Lieutenant Gullion' was visiting his
home on a furlough when the decision
of lresident Wilson and his Cabinet to
go after , Villa waB announced, and
without waiting for further orders, he
started at once to Join his company.
Nearly every regiment now on the Mex
ican border. Lieutenant Gullion added,
has many Kentucky boys In the ranks.
At Agua I'rieta last November, Lieu
tenant Gullion said he saw Villa and
his band engaged In a battle with the
Carranza troops, and on that occasion
the bandit had a following of 8.000 or
9.000 men, the majority of whom ap
peared to be well trained for service
In battle.
They were well equopped, but since t
then, Villa's forces have dwindled con
siderably, and he has lost much of his
field artillery, which means that If be
should decide to make a stand against
the American troops, his efforts can
not prove effective. Lexington Lea
