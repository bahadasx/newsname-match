BATE CHANGED
Republican Congressional Meet Mov
ed Up From April 4 to April 13 on
Account of tho Municipal Nice
etions to be IMd in Durunt.
DR. T. D. BROOKS
The above is a good llkeiiean of Dr. T. D. Brooks, of Hlllsboro, Tex.,
recently elected prosldont of the Southeastern -State Normal School of
this city, who, while responding to a toast at a luncheon in his honor
hore last Friday night, told those pveeont what he had until then kopt to
himself that h-2 would accept the proffer and would remove his family
to Durant as soon as his school board at Hlllsboro might arrange for
his release. As a matter or Tact, at Dr. Brooks afterward said, until the
luncheon was in progivs, be had not made his declslo i, and It was doubt
less the promise ,of support and cooperation there expressed that prompt
ed the final answer.
Dr. Brooks comes hore with the highest credentials For thirteen
years he has superintended the deetlny of two thousand school chlldreu
at Hlllsboro, where a hint at luavinj on hi part has brought forth a
storm of protent. In ftaturo he Is almost a giant, six feet five and a half,
wo believe ho said; and judging by hUs personality, his address, and his
evident polish, he is a giant In bruin power.
Under his guiding hand, with proper support and cooporatlon, this
Normal School can be made to shine as the brightest star In Oklahoma's
normal school galaxy.
CiTY POLITICS HUNllNG FOB
WARMING-UP IMST VILLA
j
Several Prominent Business Cn mli
ilntcs for Position on Board of
Aldermen The Primary Is to bo
Hold JJcvt Tuesday.
tiurant's city politics have warm
ed up pretty fast since the announce
ment last week by Secretary Boner
of the Election Board that a primary
is to be hold on the 21st of this
month wherein respective political
parties will select their candidates
and which primary "will be followed
early in Ajprll by an election wherein
tho candidates of the respoctfao par
ties will compete for the election
certoficate.
The first crack out of tho box the
local Republican organization got
together and filed tho names of can
didates for aldermen from each of
tho four wards. Only ono candidate
was filed by the party, honco there
is no sontost there. The organiza
tion selections were: First Ward,
H. C. Fryo; Second Ward, A. k.
Severance; Third Ward, George Wal
ker; Fourth Ward, S. I. Watson.
Thero are, however, several con
tests for tho Democratic nomina
tions, and it is in that quarter that
things are getting warm. From
Ward Ono, W. A. Kiethley. Ward Two
Jas. R. McKlnney Is the only candi
date, although G. F. Deck, the pres
ent alderman, had previously filed,
and later withdrew. In Ward Three
tho aspirants are E. C. Terrell and
M. B. Boyett. In Ward Four, thero
are three candidates filed, to-wlt:
Horace Marshall, R. P. Bowles, and
Wade Daugherty, Forrest Johnson
filed, but later withdrew.
Up until this time, so far as has
boon noticed, none of tho candidates
for the Democratic nominations has
made any campaign.
.An unusual feature of the matter
is the fact that four of the commun
ity's most prominent and successful
business men are seeking berths on
the board of aldermen, which posi
tions heretofore have been more
shunned than sought. They are A.
I Severance, Republican nominee,
head of the A. L. Severance' Hard
ware Co.; E.. G. Terrell, half ownor
of the Durant Mercantile Co.; Jas. R.
McKlnney, president of tho Durant
National Bank, and Horace Marshall,
or Johnson Marshall Co., seeking
Democratic nominations. Tho be
lief Is exprcssod, without any so
crecy, that tho continued annual in
crease In the city's tax rate has been
tho largost factor In inducing these
men of affairs to become candidates
for aldermen, from tho heller ithat
tho exorcise of more t hard-headod
business methods may go a Jong way
toward lowering tho tac burden di
rectly affecting this city.
.Secrecy Surroundln? the Activities oj
tho U. S. TroopH Rioting in Mex
ico Carranza Wants to Cnth (he
Bandit Himself.
According to tile latest dispatch
es, Brigadier General Pershing, ju
command of six thousand Jufantry
an cavalry and the necessary sup
plies, Is somewhere In Mexico hunt
ing for bandit and murderer Villa,
whom this government has set out
catch for his raids into American
territory and othor depredatibns af
fecting American lite and property.
The greatest secrecy surrounds the
activities of the troops, and no defi
nite reports are permitted to bo giv
en out. It is certain, however, that
the forces aer well into Mexico and
that they will remain there until
their mission is accomplished.
A second raid was reported at
Hlthica, N. M., Tuesday night by a
Villa band, which looted homes In
the outskirts and quickly sought
cover.
Carranza soldiors were reported
rioting at Ojlnaga Tuesday, and still
other reports claim that many Car
ranznlsts havo deserted and rushed
to Join Villa. Tuesday a half mil
lion rounds of ammunition consign
ed General Calles were seized at
Douglass, N. M., and a heavy guai'd
is watching them, while officials aro
trying to locate their source.
De Facto President Carranza early
this week expressed'hls desire to cap
ture Villa by his own hand, but seem
?d to welcome the aid of the United
States, and It is thought probable
that both the Carranza forces and
the U. S. troops aro now searching
for the outlaw and his band of
baudits,
Heavy cavalry guards havo been
stationed at every border city in an
ticipation of possible future raids.
fJRANO JURY' FINDS KILLING
