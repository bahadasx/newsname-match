Prices are advancing rapidly but owing to our heavy
buying late last year, we are still selling at 1915 prices which
we hope to maintain during March, after which we shall be

TOCK FEED
There is 550,000,000 worth of
grain in Illinois elevators and no
more can bo put in. Never bo.
fore has there teen so much
moisture in the corn, and ele
vator men are in a stato of panic
with warm weather coming- on
and no way to prevent tho corn
from rotting. Unless care to
move the 1915 crop are recoived
within a short tlmo half of tho
grain will bo lost.
Why take this chance when
you can supply your trado with
a PERFECT SUBSTITUTE
CROSBY'S STOCK FEED?
No moisture to cause trouble
because kiln dried to better than
tho point of safoty. Can be
used anywhere cornmcal is used

FINALLY
The Springfield Reporter makes the
.: w ,. Mr.
en
gago upon a campaign of education
which will result in an enforcement of
the liquor law, and recruits to the
practise of total abstinence, such as
the state has never seen." Wo hare nl
ready said, and the fact is worth cm
phasizing, that last Tuesday's decisire
no-license vote in the state as a wholo
coincident with tho rote against the
enactment of statewide prohibition,
is conclusive proof that the sentiment
of Vermont in favor of temperance
and against the evil of liquor selling,
was never stronger than today
o
And
thero was never a timo when it was
lrlr, nlnnrli' ln rnnrtr H 11 i V nil fl llO
nr nvnrv
ul v.uij
tempor-
nnce law enforcement, to actively sup
port and strengthen this sentiment.
The local-option law will only be
come weakened and ineffectual when
we become indifferent about its en
forcement and look with lenience up
on offences against it. Hero in Wind
ham county public sentiment not only
approves, but demands its strict en-
forcement. Tho only dancer now is
tuat mulor nst Wcck's overwhelming
, ,Q
vote wo may grow less watchful. The
justification for tho voto against a
prohibitory law must como through a
constant and impartioi,..qnorcemcnt o
ourTpWcnt- law; Not' only must boot-
favoritism toward infractions higher
up not if wo want public sentiment
to stay behind tlio law
It was rotten-
nesa 0 enforcement which killed tho
old prohibitory law, and the same
stato of tilings, if allowed to creep in,
will kill the local-option law in due
course.
