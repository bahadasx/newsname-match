Mayor Coffman is having troubles
of bis own just at the present stage
of affairs. The chickens are worrying

Indicative of mental btraiu.
"There is a city ordinance which
forbids the chickens of the town,
not the perfumed and puffed ami
powdered vhicUeng of the avenue, but
the befeathered poultry of the back
yards from running at large, and I
f.m going to see that this law shall be
enforced just as soon as the spring
gardens 'begin to bob np," said Mayor
Coffman to the Man on the Streets

And the 'neighbors' chickens ar.j
also 'beginning to work over time In
the matter of setting back the pro
ducts of the soil.
Thus It was that the pood house

the statement of the mayor, published

morning upon their numberless de

And the gentle voices feminine
would sift in over the wire, convey

Mrs. Blanks' chickens havts been in
my garden all morning and scratched
up the whole smear and now I have

And tho mayor spoke words of

tho above tale of woe to his ears
And then It became monotonous.
Until at last, 'B-r r-r, b-r, b-r, b-r-r-

moaned the mayor. "Sergeant Loon
