WASHINGTON', D C. March 17
Under a rule limiting general
debate to 10 hours, the house
today began considering the army bill
the most extensive proposal for in
creasing uie military establishment
eer laid before It in peace times If
possible, a final vote will be reached
tomorrow night.
Forty speakers have asked for time.
Republicans and Democrats belnir
equally represented on the list, when
the debate began. No opponent of the
general plan of preparedness had
asked to be heard.
.Speaker Clark, who -will deliver an
address in support of the measure, sur
rendered the chair to representative
Garret of Tennessee at the beginning
of the debate.
I'oatmaaters aa Recrnltlng Age-nts.
The senate committee made several
changes in its bill on final review.
As reported. It will Include a pro
vision designating postmasters all over
the country as recruiting agents. The
scheme was sugested by army officers.
It contemplates paying a fee to post
masters for eery recruit enroled
through their efforts and accepted for
service. A fee for preliminary physi
cal examination by civilian doctors also
will be provided.
Differences In mils.
The essential difference between the
house and senate bills lies in the pro
visions an to the regular army.
The house measure proposes to add
new organizations to the existing es
tablishment to gle It a total peace
strength of iio,ouu lighting troops.
The prbportlons of artillery and cav
alry to the whole army would bo
changed to produce a well balanced or
ganization. The oenatp bill provides
for a sweeping reorganization of the
regular army in all departments as
urged by the war college In the plan
of 1912. It provides a peace strength
of 178,000.
The Federal Volunteers.
Of first Importance in both bills,
army officials declare, are tho provis
ions for the organization of federal
volunteers after the federalization of
the national guard to the utmost legal
extent haa been accomplished. The
house bill would work out the project
of building up a great citizen army in
peace times through extension of the
summer training camp plan. The sen
ate bill proposes to go directly at the
task, giving the president wide author
ity to organize regiments in every con
gressional district
Oppose Chamberlain Bill,
Senator Hitchcock. Democrat, submit
ted a minority report on the senate bill.
"I do not feel justified In joining my
colleagues in the recommendation that
the standing army be increased 78 per
cent," Mr Hitchcock stated. "In my
opinion the increase is about twice as
much as It should be. It would give us
an army of 250,000 men, enlisted to full
strength "
An effort to pass a bill practically
doubling the number of cadets at the
military academy at West Point was
blocked by senator Jones, Republican,
who objected to Its immediate consider

In fixing 140,000 men as the strength
of the army, he said, the committee
had gone on what war department of
ficials had testified was the limit of
peace time recruitment. A force, of
250,000 regulars would mean compul
sory service, to which the country was
opposed, and an annual expenditure of
9750,000,000 for the army alone.
"Of course," Mr Hay eald, 'if It

The text of the resolution follows
"Rosolved by the senate (the house

Paris, France, March 17 The retire
ment of admiral von Tirpitz is consid
ered In French official circles, accord
ing to the Paris newspapers, to be due
to the fact that he has opposed the
coming out of the German fleet, while
omperor William desires to seo it en

The conclusion is consequently drawn
that a change may be looked for in the

Amsterdam, Holland, March 17 The
newest and finest steamship sailing
under the Dutch flag, the Tubantia, of
the Holland Lloyd line, was sunk early
Thursday, 30 miles off the Dutch coast
Although it is not positvely estab
lished whether the sinking was due to
a mine or torpedo, there is singular
unanlmit) on the part of those aboard
in attributing it to a submarine's act
Tho crew bases its belief chiefly on
tho intense violence of the explosion
and on the fact that it occurred, amid
ships. The vessel was bound from Amster
dam to South American ports, carrying
a crew of 291 and 82 passengers, the
latter mostly neutrals. Including, it la
said, three Americans.
The ship bore the usual identifica
tion marks of her neutral character.
Including an illuminated name and
flag.
The disaster has created a profound
sensation throughout Holland. The
Sress comments reflect anger and in
ignation The Nieuw Rotterdamsche
Courant says
'Between being torpedoed and being
mined the onl difference which ex
ists is that known in criminal between
intention and conditional intention. If
the ship was torpedoed, there was ab
solute intention or ignorance, or neg
lect equivalent to intention The sub
marine commander must have known
when he gave the command to fire that
the ship was the Tubantia. No words
can be found to qualify this crime; no
excuses can be acepted "

It 1b now believed there was a small
number of lives lost in the sinking of
tho Tubantia, either in the explosion or
in an accident which attended the
launching of a lifeboat The steam

FfcW who put a sprig of shamroik in their
buttonhole on the seventeenth of Minh
iealize that these littlo green It. ives
troie than once kept tho Irish from death in
dire famine times.
In 1596 the poet Spenser declares Uiat tho
war has brought the -miserable inhabitants
of Munster to a point where they "flock to 1
plot of water-cresses or shamrocks as to 1
feast" In his "View of Irebind" he describes
this as the depth of ruin to which a land
formerly having abundant corn and cattle
had been plunged.
The troublous times continued and the
shamrock is mentioned as an article of food
again and again. Fynes Morrison In 159R
writes that the herb is still being "snatched
out of the ditche-. -or food." Withers in
tmses b'trlpt and W nipt" (1613) sings:
And for my clothing 111 a mantle go
'And feed on shamrocks as tho IrlBh doe"
Not until later was the shamrock used as
the national emblem of Erin. Nathaniel Col
gan member of the Royal Irish Academ.
sas the earliest record of tho wearine
o' the green" is contained in the diary of
1 nomas Dinely. who wrote In 1S87:
17th da at March yearly is St Patruk
in immoveable feast, when the Irish of all
stations and conditions wear crosses in their
hats, some of pins, some of green ribbons,
and the vulgar superstltlously wear sham
rogues, three leaved grass which they like
wise eat (they say to cause a sweet breath)
The common people and servants also demand
their Patrick's groat of their masters which
they go expressly to town, though half a
dozen miles off, to spend, where sometimes it
amounts- to a piece of 8 or cobb a piece, and
very few of the zealous are found sober at
night
A later reference to tha wearing of the
shamrock appears in the works of Dr. Caleb
Threlkeld, a botanist of the early 18th cen
tury He says: "The people wear the plant
in their hats in commemoration of St Pat
rick, believing that- t Patrick used the
three lobed leaf to explain the Christian
Trinity. This belief Is generally aald by
antiquarians to have arisen in the 14th cen
