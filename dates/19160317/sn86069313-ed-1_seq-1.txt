Indicated tho defacto government
was making' a supreme effort to cap
ture Villa with its own forces there
was no sign that General Funston's
orders to proceed on the same er

Word that the American troops
had crossed tho border still was
lacking, the war department Itself
not having been advised as to when
the. movement 'would begin.
Congress Takes Notice.
Congress took active notice of sthe.
border situation today for the first
time. The house late today passed
a Joint resolution, authorizing the
recruiting ot the mobile regular,
army to full strength. This means an
addition ot approximately 20,000
fighting men. The senate is expected
to concur tomorrows

Large detachments ot Mexican
troops with artillery have boen with
drawn from the Yaqul campaign in
southern Sonora and started north,
according to reliable radio 'advices
received here today. Ralds by Ya

feared. A proclamation 'over Car

late, yesterday at Guaymus stating
Carranza had informed the' Ameri

PEACE DOVE BUILDS
TfEST IN FORD PLANT
Chicago, March 14. Henry Ford
who tried to bring peace in Europe
has. carried the idea into the house
of his employes, according to revela
tions made hero, today before Judge
Dennis E. Sullivan, ot tho Superior
Court. v
The peace leader's rules provide
that employes and their wives who
disagree must hoist tho white flag,
obtain divorces or quit the service
ot the company and lose their ?5 a
day wages.
Henry Carter, a porter emptbyed
by the company, received a divorce
from his wife here on a charge ot
desertion, and his witness was Wal
ter Q. May, of Evanston, formerly
superintendent ot the sociological de
partment ot the Ford works.
May revealed the Idea of the manu
facturer that the workman who
quarrels with his wife in the morn
ing makes a poor workman all the
day.
'Pie testified he had done every
thing possible to reconcile Carter
and his wife, but failed. He- said.
Carter was a good workman and the
company did not want to lose him.
"As I understand, from the .rules
ot the company, a man that Is In the
predicament that Mr. Carter Is in
bow will lose his posltlea unless he
Is able to separate hlsKfreDa his
wife?" Carter's1 a'ttMaVy.asktd.

'Jll.Paso, Tex., March 16, The bor

that' before another twenty-;fpur

troops would be sent across the .'Mex

Another problem, the Americans
said, lay In the. fact that through fear
or Ignorance the Mexicans residing
In country regions of Chihuahua give
considerable allegiance to Villa. In
the cities ,they considered the Car
ranza sentiment dominant, but' said,
that Villa was free to travel without
danger In rural "regions, unless he
came Into actual, contact with Car
ranza troops.
Considerable surprise was shown
over a story from Douglas, Arlz.,that
United States soldiers, had seized halt
a million cartridges consigned to Gen.
Cales. None of the American mili
tary officials hero would confirm or
discuss tne siory. . , ,, ,
Censorship Tightened.
Another development today was
the tightening ot'the censorship ov
er the.sendlng'of American telegrams'
Into Mexico by the Carranza author
ities. All-messages ,were closely
.scrutinized by the officials on the
Mexican side ot the border and nQne
that was Couched in code or the
meaning of which was dubious was
permitted to pass. Hitherto rail
road officials haye been -allowed to
sendycodo telegrams, but this privi
lege has been withdrawn.
While the border waited In keen
expectancy for word that United
States soldiers had crossed the In
ternational line, reports flowed In
from Mexican sources to the effect
that Mexico's archbandlt already had
boen surrounded by the troops of
Carranza'. The "flrst chief' was. ap
parently making strenuous efforts to
antlclpato the Americans and was
reported from several sources to
have concentrated more than10,000
troops at different points about Cas
as Grandes region in- Chihuahua,
where Villa Is supposed to be.

and .the scene, ot. the Villa raid had

last ot the corps officers who 'were
stationed here. The. stoppage ot
transport, trains was regarded as par
ticularly significant, as their move

since the news ot the Columbus raid
was fashed through the country!
Their stoppage, apv fs talen to mean

. The fire broke out In the root of

-..-CARRANZA
TROOPS FIRS ON
THE BORDER PATROL
El Paso, Tex., March 15.. Grave
fears are felt that the American in
vaslon would prompt a general up
rising in favor of Villa In Northern
Mexico.
Thomas H. Davis, a rancher, well
known about Columbus, arrived in
El Paso today and said without
of Gen. Funston, is triumphantly
equivocation that Carranza troops
had flred on the American Invaders.
"It was getting dawn as I drove
Into town," he said. "As I arriv
ed at the outskirts about 4 o'clock
I heard a violent fusillade of small
arms. I thought that Villa was at
tacking the town again. When I
arrived. In Columbus, the firing still
could be heard by everyone In town.
The Inhabitants were out In the
street wondering what it meant. The
troopers ot the Thirteenth Cayalry
dashed out toward the border.'
"Rapid volleys of musketry were
heard in Columbus for the next
hour.
"it was said that Carranza troops
had flred on the American border
patrol, who had repaid In kind."

French prisoner Wonld Not Carrjr

Paris, March 14. One of the nest
remarkable stories of the war is lord
by a r.oldier who was made a:prlsea
er in the Ardennes In .August; 11 4,
and who is now in a hospital lis
Paris. When he was captured, the soldier
was taken to the rear, and was ta
formed by a .German officer that (her
regiment was going to march throttgf
the 'town and that he would have 9
carry the German flag. The Freaca
soldier refused to do this, and wa
told that he would then be shot for
disobeying orders. "Shoot me," h ,
replied, "I will not carry your flag."
The German 'officer detached sev
en , men and ordered the French get
dler to be shot at'the first house is
the village. The man was bouad,
and the firing party started for tho
place Of execution. Oh the reset
eight French prisoners under a Ger
man escort were met. "They wish to
'strike your imagination," said ths
doomed soldier, "I am going to be
shot. ' Do not allow yourselves to ha
demoralized." '
Al the first house in the village
the French soldier was- sfio't. He felt
with four bullets In his" rl'gtit ara,
two in, the leg and one in the side. "
The firing party w6re' men, belong-

The Voldier was not-kliled.. He re
gained consciousness. A German of
ficer on horseback passed, and the
soldier Implored his help. The of
ficer dismounted and without a word
flred his revolver at his head. ,
But the shot was not fatal. Next
day the Frenchman felt his strength
returning. A doctor wearing gold
spectacles was bending over him, and
gave orders for a piece of canvas to
be thrown over his body. A ticket
with the words '-'not transportable"
was pinned to the canvas. The mfr
pqsedly dead soldier waj still eoa?

For three days he lay there. Thea,
on the evening ot the fourth ,he felt
that he was being moved. With a
supreme effort he aroused himself
from the torpor of death and grbaa
ed. He subsequently found himself
In an ambulance with Belgium nurs
es attending hjm A German doctor
was giving orders. J4
Afterward he learned that' (wo
German soldiers had picked him up,
believing that he had received nir
wounds while fighting. The French
soldier held his tongue as to what
had really occurred, For ten months
he remained in Belgium and was s
then sent to Germany where he liv

nally he was returned to France with
other seriously wounded prisoners.
"And here I am," said the soldier
concluding his extraordinary tale,
