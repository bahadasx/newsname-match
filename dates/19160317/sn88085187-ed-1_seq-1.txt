GHASTLY SUICIDE ON AVENUE
BY CAROLYN WELLS
That ought to be guarantee enough that
next week's story in the Novel-a-Week ser
ies will be good, hadn't it.
It is good. It's "The Maxwell Mystery,"
and believe somebody who's read it, it's a
mystery of mysteries.
MEADS
Johnnie Meads, city controller, is a typi
cal .22-calibre office holder.
He is for better known for cat-and-dog
wrangles with other officials than for con
struct lYe work.
He is more of a bookkeeper than an ac
countant.
He is more of a politician than a public
servant.
There is no excuse whatever for re-elect
ing him this spring.
He is opposed by four, possibly five, can
didates, each one, so far jis The Times has
been able to determine, quite as competent
to rim the controller's office as is Meads,
and several of them strikingly more com
petent.
And vvvvy one of the five is Meads' su
perior as a MAN. Every one of the five is
broader guage. None of the live gives off
that peanut odor.
