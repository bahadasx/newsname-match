LOCAL AND GENERAL NEWS
Some of It May Interest You; All
Of It Is Worth a Perusal
Cylinder Press Installed
A Campbell cylinder news
paper press was added to The
News plant this week. The press
was received Monday; it has been
erected in The News building,
but it has not yet been adjusted
for operation. To do this mav
require the services of an expert
press erector, consequently a
week or two must elapse before
the press is ready for use.
Until the new press is placed
in commission tbe old equipment
will be used, and the size of the
paper will remain as it is now
four pages some weeks and six
pages other weeks, varying ac
cording to the amount of matter
éet for use. This week but four
pages are printed, the time used
by the office force in erecting: the
cylinder press making it neces
sary to curtail the work in the
composing room.
When the cylinder press is put
in use the size of the paper will
be changed. Four pages seven
columns wide will be printed in
stead of four pages six columns
wide Practically the same a
mount of matter will be used in
four of the larger pages as can
be used in six of the smaller
pages. Moreover, the press-
work will be cut two-thirds.
The whole of the enlarged paper
can be printed with two impres
sions, while to print six pages of
the present size pages as they
are now printed requires six im
pressions. The News plant is now the
largest and most complete news
paper and job printing plant in
this section of the state. When
a linotype is isntalled, which may
be done within the next year,
the equipment will be complete.
Until that time, we shall rest
content in the knowledge that
no town of equal size with Hoi
brook has a better plant than
that of The News.
Hot on Trail of Villa
A dispatch in the Albuquerque
Journal this morning states that
two troops of U. S. cavalrv left
Hachita. N. M.. yesterday and
are marching into Mexico in
search of the Villa bandits.
These troops are reported to be
marching with tffe minimum of
equipment and to be led by Mor
mon scouts from the Mormon
colonies at Colonia Dublan and
Colonia Morales. From their
point of departure the distance
is eight-five miles to Casas
Grandes and the start was made
early yesterday morning. If
Villa intends to offer any organ
ized resistance to his pursuers it
might be possible for United
States soldiers to come in con
tact with bis outlying posts very
soon.
The campaign is being con
ducted on the assumption that
the de facto government's troops
will co-operate in the efforts to
destroy Villa and his followers,
but, with the exception of the
small garrison at Palomas, op
posite Columbus, that joined
General Pershing's column as
scouts and guards, there is no
indication that the Carranza
forces in any considerable num
bers will join in the bunt for
Villa.
How about electric fixtures for
your home? Call on W. H.
Clark; he has catalogs from
which you can select, and will
make delivered prices, cash with
order. tf.
Twice a week shipments of
fresh vegetables at Wetzler's.
Road Petitions in Circulation
Petitions are now being circu
lated for presentation to the
Board of Supervisors, of Navajo
County, Arizona, in which said
Board is petitioned to call an
election to vote road bonds for
the construction and improve
ment of roads in the county.
The election proposed, if held,
will decide whether or not the
county will vote one hundred
twenty five bonds in the sum of
one thousand dollars each or a
total sum of $125,000.00 for the
purposes above mentioned.
Apache County on the east and
Coconino County on the west
have much better roads than
Navajo County, and this state of
affairs is due to the fact that
each of said counties has voted
bonds for improving and con
structing their respective roads,
and the results have been good.
Nayajo County should keep
abreast of its neighbors.
To issue bonds in the sum
mentioned, will mean that the
county secures and has good
roads. Most of the money de
rived from the sale of such bonds
will be received by residents of
the county in return for work
and labor performed. The coun
ty and its people will be more
prosperous, and the burden of
taxation to pay each of said bonds
as each of same become due will
be but little on any person or
i company, while the results will
be many and of far reaching ef
fect This is a question of much
interest to the county and its
tax-payers, and it is believed
that the benefits to be derived
therefrom will be lasting, numer
ous and valuable, while the in
jury or damage will be none, and
the cost to any person or persons
or company will be very nominal.
C. H. Jordan.
County Attorney.

representative of the Ideal Ladies
Tailoring Company of Chicago.

Rank Foolishness.
Ycu occasionally see it stated
that colds do not result from cold
weather. That is rank foolish
ness. Were it true colds would
be as prevalent in midsummer as
in midwinter. The microbe that
causes colds flourishes in damp,
cold weather. To get rid of a
cold take Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy. It is effectual and it is
highly recommended by people
who have used it for many years
as occasion required, and know
its real value. Obtainable every
where. You can save money by buying
bed sheets, pillowslips, etc., now
at Wetzler's.

The News was in error lastj
week in stating that Julius Wet-J
zler was taking contracts for
cement walks. Mr. Wetzler was
simply instrumental in getting
the firm of Whitson Bros,, of
Flagstaff, to come to Hoibrook to
do some work for him. Since
coming here and starting work
for Mr. Wetzler, this firm has
secured a number of contráctil office- VÍ8Íted relatives in Wins
from others for walks, and itf iow last Sunday,
looks as though the habit of putt-j Say! Have you seen the latest
ing in walks would grow in Hoi-'Styles in ladies' hats and no
brook, a thing which will be of
great benefit to the town.
Senator D. D. Crabb of Linden

ing their lamb crop a week or
more ago. J. W. Richards con
tracted his lambs at 7 cents per

the cattle and sheep growers
than was ljst year.

The Hoibrook schools opened
last Monday morning after an
enforced yacation of three weeks
on account of the prevalence of
measles. Only about one-half of
the pupils in the primary depart
ment responded to the roll-call,
but more have been coming in
each day since. The upper de
partments fared better, the at
tendance being slightly below
normal. Miss Trafton, teacher
of the south side school, opened
her school Monday morning, but
closed in the afternoon, she
breaking out with measles her
self. Tuesday Frank Campbell of
Snowflake closed a deal in which
he transferred his ranch, 5 miles
north of Hoibrook, to Frank Wal
lace of this place. Besides his
land leases there were included
in the deal about 300 head of
cattle. The amount of money
involved in the transaction is not
made public, but it is said to run
well up into five figures. On the
same day Mr. Campbell purchas
ed the ranch and cattle interests
of H. T. Willis, east of Snow
flake. This transaction involved
about the same amount as that
of the Campbell-Wallace deal.
In another column Will be
found a communication from
County Attorney Jordan in re
ference to the road bond petitions
which are now being circulated
throughout the county. The
arguments advanced by Mr. Jor
dan in favor of bond issue of ap
proximately $125.000 are good.
A number of new bridges were
provided for by a bond issue of
$63.000 a few weeks ago. and it
is estimated that affout $125,000
should be expended on the high
ways in the county to put them
in good shape. The News be
lieves that the taxpayers will
make no mistake in signing the
petitions for the bond election.
It is hoped that the petitions will
be presented to the board of
supervisors at the April meeting.
The hours of service have been
extended by the Hoibrook Light
company. Lights are now run
ning until 2 o'clock in the morn
ing, and the plant is also run
every Wednesday all day for
people who desire to use electric
irons. Manager Baird has sold
a considerable number of irons
and he is putting in a stock of
other electric appliances. As
soon as the business will justify
the extra expense a 24-hour ser
vice will be put in operation.
Last Monday J. H. Woods ship
ped a team of hcrses to Flag
staff, from which place the horses
had been stolen the week before.
Tbe man and woman who stole

town by the sheriff of Coconino
county and were taken to Flag
staff for trial The horses had
been ridden so hard that they
were not able to travel and were
left with Mr. Woods until they
could be moved by freight.
At the regular monthly meet
ing of the local Masonic lodge
last Saturday night bids for th'e
erection of a temple in Hoibrook
were considered. It was found
that the building as planned
would cost more than the amount
of money on hands, consequently
all the bids were rejected. It
is probable that new plans
will be made, and a smaller
building will be erected.

Hoibrook. Mr. Donohoe was
bitten last Sunday on the right
