It waa a motley crowd that as
sembled at the citizens' meeting
at the court house Monday nigh I
for the purpose of nominating a
"citizens ticket" of cicy officers
to be voted upon at the coming
city election on April 4 and in
cidentatlv for the purpose of
putting through the slate that
had alrly been worked out
In the beginning let us state
that we are perfectly satisfied
with the nominees and especially
with the choice for Mayor. Mr.
Childers was suggested by the
News in last week's issue and
we are pleased to learn that our
suggestion was acceptable and
the nomination made unanimous.
We cannot, however, ia justice
to our readers and in view of
our previous declarations on the
question of a "citizens ticket" I
refrain from commenting on the
manner in which it was "did."
. Ever since the democratic
meeting some time ago there has
been more or less talk of the
"steam roller" tactics adopted
then, but it had nothing on the
meeting of Monday night. For
several days it is said that little
conferences had 1 'Pen held in a
certain doctor's office for the
purpose of framing the slate.
That it waa successfully framed
was conclusively proven to the

it Wis, of course without an or
ganization head and it was nec
essary for some one to appoint
themselves a temporary chair
man. This was gracefully done
by R. E. Rowelis and upon mo
tion Sam Bratton was made
permanent chairman. The floor
work was manipulated so 'suc
cessfully that practically a 1 1
nominations were immediately
closed and the nominees delect
ed by acclimation. B. M, Brizen
dine, the accountant who ha
given such efficient service as
city clerk, was unanimously
nominated as wim A. vV. SKur-riu

Hockenhull suggested that the
citizens of each ward repair to
some nook in the building and
select thou alderman, one trom
each ward, the other molding
over, The selections made by
each ward and nominated by the
convention are as follows:
1st Ward, Gus M. Bryan
2nd Ward, I. C. Johnson
3rd Ward, E. tt. Eascnam
4th Ward, Jack Hail.
The hold overs are as follows:

The peace and quietude of the
meeting was apmewhat perturb
ed aud disturbed in its ri.ui
stage, when Alex Shipley, presi
dent of the Clovis National Bank
arose and with much agusto and
solemnity declared that his bank
had not been treated right in
tne matter of the nomination of
a city treasurer. He said that

National Bank, has been city

About That Bond Issue
The News has made further
inquiry about that proposed
$;o,000 bond issue to be voted
upon at the coming city election
and from what we are bow able
to learn, the issue should be
voted down, point blank, or
changed to a $10,000 issue. Sev
eral.of our leading business men
have informed Hie News that in
their belief the plant m not run
ning full capacity and will rot
do so for at least iwu ears to
come. They argue that at the
time the plant was purcoased it
was guaranteed to meet '.he re
quire nents of a city of eight to
ten thousand inhabitants; that
two years ago it was stated by
those in charge that the electri
cal department was running
only 25 per cent capacity and
that tor it to have increased to
full capacity within that space
of time wouid be impot-sible.
Again they argue thai $10,000
would be sufficient to n.ake the
necessary water and sewerage

other $25,000 ib ui.nec. ssary and

to learn the pen liment in favor
of a $10,000 i-fue is unanimous,
but that there in a strong proba

voted down. We recommend
this matter to the careful con
sideration of the voters of Clovis

The Small Pox Situation
Much ado about nothing, is
the sum and substance ofhe
small pox situation in Clovis.
That there ever was the genuine
disease known as Small pox in
Clovis is disputed by many, how
ever the News physician has
never made an examination of
the cases to ascertain how seri
ous each individual case might
be. One thing we do know and
that is that the matter has been
greatly exaggerated by news
papers and reports, to the seri
ous. injury of the town. That
the smallpox epidemic or some
thing closely akin to the disease
is abating is not disputed. Few
new cases have developed and
the situation seems to be well in
hand. The doctors have been
kept busy vaccinating the popu
lation and it is said that approxi
mately a thousand have been tn
oculated with the serum What
ever the dhcatt may be, it is in
a very mild firm and many of
the patients nave not eve i been

MONDAY NIGHT
VILLA DEAD OR ALIVE IS ORDER.
U. S. TROOPS CROSS BORDER
In the Raid by Villa Bandits at Columbus Last Week in
Which 7 Soldiers and 9 Civilians Were Killed, the
Government Has Been Quick to Petaliate by Order,
ing Troops to Cross Into Mexico and "Get" the Bandit.
Complications with Mexico are
daily growing serious. . 12000
federal troops have concentrated
at the Mexican border in south
western New- Mexico to begin a
campaign against Villa with the
orders to capture him and his
band of from 1200 to 5000 fol
lowers, "dead or alive." In
this task the troops will have
the co operation of the Carranza
forces, it is said, who have
granted permission for the
American troops to cross pro
viding they are given the same
privilege to cross into American
territory for the same purposes.
This has been granted. As
stated in last weeks issue, the
Villa bandits in the early hours
of the morning before day light
crept up into Columbus, New
Mexico, evading for the time
being the three troops of the
13th Cavalry stationed there and
killed sixteen civilians and sol
oiers and injured many others
including women and children.
The few cavalry were soon up
and doing business and in the
running fight that followed soon
after day break, Col. Slocum
with his troops followed and al
though outnumbered lOtol they
succeeded
in killing seventy-
five to one hundred Mexicans.
Eighteen were picked up in the
streets of Columbus and their
bodies burned. Several wound
ed were captured and will be
tried for murder. Troops have
been rushed to the scene and the
aero scouts will locate the ban
dits in the mountains while the
troops will do the rest. Excite
ment is running high in El Pas
and the mayor has ordered all
the citizens to arm themselves
as it is feared that all Mexicans
will resent the idea of American
entry into their territory and
that war will. result. The light

Crow said that he could and took
