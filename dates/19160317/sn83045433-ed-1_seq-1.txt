FRANCE'S WAR

Gen. Gallieni Superseded by
Gen. Roques, Following
Rumors of Illness.
OUTGOING MINISTER WAS
ONCE GOVERNOR OF PARIS
For Years Has Been Enemy of Gen.
Joffre--Was Criticised for Con
duct of Aviation Corps.
Ihmal Iabe to 'f. wasingw Herald.
Paris. Mar-h 16-Gen. Gailleni has been
supreded by Ge-n. Rloqucs as minister
of war
It was -ttated some days ago that Gen.
G1allini was Ill. Iast night the appoint
ment of Almiral Lacase to take his
Plac temporaiy Was anrinounced.
Admiral Leoase was to combine his
functions as minister of marine with
those of the war ministry.
Tonight the defnite appointment of
G on. Rocues s, announced.
Former Governdr of Parts.
Gu. Joseph Simon Gallieni has been
the French minister of war slnce October,
111. Before that he was military gover
nor of Paris. Before the war brok- out,
there hait been a feud of thirty years
standing between Gen. Joffre and Gallieni.
They had not shaken hands nor ex
clangedi friendly greetings during that
peroid.
Vith the dclar&tion of war, they
huried the hatchet and promised to co
operate with each other to the fullest
degree for the good of their country.
Since then there have been no indica
tions of a reopening of the feud.
There has. however, been frequent
friction between Gallteni and the French
senate. as a result of which Gallient has
more than onle threatened to resign.
Former Premier Georges Clemenceau,
head of the senate army commission, has
been an outspoken critic of the ministry
and of the conduct of the war.
Much of this criticism has been directed
against alleged faults in the French
aviation service.
Aviation Service Criticised.
It niy significant, in this connection,
that Gen. Roqes. who succeeds Gailleni.
was formerly inspector-general of the air
service and Is an authority on matters
of military aviation.
The first rumors of a break between
Gallieni and the senate were published
in this country on March 10, when)
censored dispatch from Paris stated that
Gallieni lied not attended a meeting of
the army commtission of the aenate.
Anm official note at the same time said
that ho had been unable to receive menm
hers of Parliament.
Unofficially it was stateid that Gallieni
was lit. No details of his illness have
been cabled.
