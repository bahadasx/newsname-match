Two Interdependent causes are as
signed to the sudden discontent: the res

ai Minister of Marine and the Impression
created thereby that the Government has
completely "surrendered" to tho Amer

which. In turn. Is Interpreted as mean

against the Allies.
Herlln's political atmosphere Is to-day
fraught with ominous tension. Many
Itelchstag delegates who thus far have
proved tll; Government's chief i.lll.ils
are now openly threatening "lnurgcncy."
To Invite Open Debate.
As a result of this unprecedented sit

The correspondent of Tiir. Sun Is In

date the Government counts not solely
upon a gradual recension of the ptesent
tide of criticism and smouldering op
position, but figures that the Intervening
eight days will see certain developments
which will lie apt tn asuage the critics.
In the llrst place the Government
hopes that by that time the battle of
vordun will have reached a stage which
would favorably affect the mood of the
people and Its representatives, Secondly,
thero Is .1 strong hope In the Wllhelm

GEN. CARRANZA WIRES
"INCIDENT IS SETTLED"
The followinir mrssHge was received by TilK SUN yenterday from
First Chief Vcnustiuno Catrunzu in reply to a cable sent on March 13:
QUERETARO, Mexico. March IS.
Your rnimit dated March 13 ii at hand. 1 have already r
ceived an acknowledgment from the Government of the White
House to the note which I directed there. The international inci
dent it settled satisfactorily. CARRANZA.
This niosiniro would indicate that reports of Get). CarratiZH'fl
HSMissinntioii are false. The reports have persisted lately that Gen.
Obrt-Kon is in chitrRf.
The acknowledgment "from the Government of the White House"
referred to by Carrunza is the permission (-ranted by the United States
Government to send Mexican troops into the United States in pursuit
of bandits. From this it appears that Carranza considers all dancer of
11 disagreement between the dc facto Government and the White House
set aside.
