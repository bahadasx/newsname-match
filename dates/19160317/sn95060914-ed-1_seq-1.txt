GILA ACADEMY
I Enthusiastically Endorsed by
Mrs Eva M Gourley Mem
ber of the Alumni
The following very interesting
letter to the faculty and fellow
students of the Gila A6ademy was
received by Prof A C Peterson
from Mrs Eva M Gourley a
member of the Alumni and now
residing in Las Angeles iai
Dear Friends The Guardian
much appreciated and faithful
visitor has just arrived
-x 1 read with eagerness the
articleBoost Gymnasium Then
I wanted to shout hurrah For
while I Love You California
I sigh 0 Arizona Sun kissed
Land and Tho Its a Long Way
to Tipperary My Heart is Right
There
Since I came here I have learned
to understand the gymnasium
with such a depth of
tion that I cannot find words to
express iriyself on paper Just
wish I could talk to you and tell
you what it has done for me and
mine
You may get some help from
enclosed- little booklet from the
Turn Verein Germama the school
that has accomplished wonderful
results with my children
The time is very near when all
will agree that a course in physical
training should be one of the
most important parts of the
cation of any boy or girl This
was recognized by the Greeks
centuries ago They trained the
individual in gymnastics from
childhood into manhood in order
to develope in the qualities of
obedience self reliance cpntrol
of temper courage and persist
ence
The old philosophers knew that
only in a well trained body can
the mind exercise its beneficial
control over the passions
The problem as to whether the
education of the young man or
young woman is complete without
a thorough course in physical up
building must be considered
Physical training is not merely
athletic training or muscular
development while it recognizes
as an important basic truth that
a sound mind is impracticable
without aaound body It goes
much further and holds that
the body is the temple of the soul
and life of the brain Any weak
ness of the body or of the vital
organs impairs the brain and im
perils the soul
- Health happiness and success
are dependent on the harmonious
and perfect action of every part
of the complex human organiza
tion
Character religion and morals
are moulded as much by the
stomach heart and lungs as by
education and environment
Health and strength represent
assets that are invaluable in
character They are worth more
than money and might truly be
said to represent the foundation
of a human career
One might as well try to build
a house on a crumbling founda
tion as to make n success of ones
life without health and at least a
moderate supply of the muscular
nervous ana vital vigor which
should accompany it
Energy is necessary to effort
of any kind this is lacking if one
possesses a defective human ma-
chine
In a well equipped gymnasium
by thorough systematic gym
nastics repeated performance
of exercises prescribed by graded
series one may become a literal
human dynamo
Hence physical culture in its
broadest sense is the develop-
ment of a well balanced
v tion A sound mind in a sound
- body
I should like to send a small
boquet to the Alumni tomorrow
if I can
California at this season is be
decked in Century Class colors
literally robed in colors of white
and gold
Kindest regards to you all
I remain yours in interest

DEAN DEFLECTORS
Have Been Placed on Z C
Prinas and Big Ranch
River Lands
During the recent floods caused
by high water in the una river
considerable acreage of farming
lands bordering on the river was
washed away
In order to save the remaining
land on his ranch from the rav
ages of this uncontrolable stream
during flood times Z C Prina
took nip the proposition of F N
Holmquist representing the Dean
Deflector Co of San Francisco
Cal to place twp deflectors at
the points of his ranch abutting
the river where the river was
washing away the land
These deflectors haye been
placed and so far have shown
that they will be successful for
the purpose
The Big Ranch lost about 15
acres valued at 20000vper acre
when the river was up about two
months ago and the owners
Messrs Chambers Nonnamaker
and Simms have also sought the
aid of these deflectors to prevent
the loss of any more land
Five deflectors have been placed
in position on this ranch begin
ning the head of the trouble
where the San Simon empties in
to the Gila river The first two
deflectors were placed 300 feet
apart and the next three 190
feet apart The deflectors have
all been placed and the work
was finished Monday
As a result of placing these de
flectors the silt in the waters is
forming a new bank west of the
deflector while the deflector it-
self turns the current away from
the bank
The Dean deflector is in the
shape bf a V with the point in
the stream The length of the
deflector is 18 feet from base to
point on either side and the
width of the base is 12 feet The
deflectors are made of 4 by 6-
inch sills and 2 by 8 inch braces
arid siding A J mch steel -cable
on the down stream side are
fastened to the deflector and
anchored 50 feet from bank to a
cement dead man
The deflector is held up above
the bottom of the stream allow
ing the waters to pass under it
this keeps up the level on the
lower side of the deflector so that
there is no tendency for the water
to return to the bank The outer
end of the deflector is anchored
to a cement anchor so as to pre
vent it from rising
The Dean deflector has been
used successfully at the head of
the Buckeye canal on the1 Gila
nver and has withstood three
heavy floods
Six of these deflectors have
now been placed on Mineral creek
at Ray Arizona The first one
was placed in position before the
recent flood and successfully
turned the waters and saved the
tracks and yards of the Ray Con
solidated Copper Company from
being washed away
More of these deflectors will
undoubtedly be placed on lands
abutting the river and will be the
means of turning away the cur
rent and forming a new embank
ment

planting the elm Arizona ash or
other varieties that are known to
do well in our climate When
these are well started the cotton
woods should be cut out gradual

of the new trees demanded This
is the most practical and most

takes ten years to accomplish the
reform The club will work
