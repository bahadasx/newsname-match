How One Alan Helped His Town
by Originating Pay-Up Week
HOW ray-Up Week originated may bo of interest. Hero's
liow tlio nation wide movement had its start:
Lewis W. Moore, editor of the. Border Telephone of
Hume, Bates county, Mo., has tlio habit of regularly doing unusual
things of a progressive nature. As a result of his persistent, un
tiring advocacy, practically every building iu Hume is painted
white, anil traveling men from everywhere liuvu christened it the
White City arid retold its glories throughout the country.
THE RESULT OF HIS PAY-UP WEEK CAMPAIGN WAS 80
HIGHLY SATISFACTORY TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN HUME
THAT IT BECAME SPEEDILY NOISEO ABOUT, AND EDITOR
MOORE RECEIVED SO MANY INQUIRIES FROM METROPOLITAN
NEWSPAPERS", MANUFACTURERS. WHOLESALERS, JOBBERS
AND RETAILERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED 8TATE3 THAT HE
ASSUMED THE RESPONSi BIL.TY OF PROCLAIMING A NATIONAL
PAY-UP WEEK. '
Editor Moore states that the business men of Hume were
ngrccablv surprised over the almost complete settlement of all ac
count ue them, and theso citizens were more pleased over the
rase with which tho feat was accomplished and Hie great satisfac
tion resulting from being able to know and say that all of their
debts were paid.
WHAT WAS DONE IN HUME CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED IN EV
ERY CITY, TOWN AND HAMLET IN THE UNITED STATES. CON
CERT OF -ACTION EASILY CAN BE WORKED UP. TO PAY YOUR
DEBTS IS AS IMPORTANT AS IT IS TO GO TO CHURCH. BOTH
ARE MORAL OBLIGATIONS, THE FULFILLING OF WHICH WILL
GIVE YOU SATISFACTION.
' JOIN THE PAY-UP WEEK CROWD.
You'll help tho town.
WHEN YOU HELP THE TOWN YOU HELP YOURSELF.
Pay-Up Week Idea Simple; It
Makes For Prosperity at Home
Shoes Shoes
Beautiful new spring
line of Wan Shoes
just received. Call and
inspect our line. New
line of Hats just in.
Car load of Furniture
just arrived.
SOME persons wonder how the l'ay-Up idea works. For ex
ample, suppose you came in and paid us that dollar on your
subscription. We would owe thai dollar to the butcher and
run and pay him.- Thus two debts are settled. The butcher would
owe the harness maker and go and pay him. Three debts are set
tled. The harness maker owes (he grocer and would run and pay
him. Four debts are paid. You would bring in your eggs,. and
the gTocer would pay you the same dollar.
- There you would have it. Every one would pay every one else,
and in the end all would be paid. None would be out much of
anything except debt.
Let's start the movement in this town without delay. Get the
dollars moving. If you owe a bill that is duo before Pay-Up WTeek
don't pay it until Pay-Up Week gets here. 1 f you owe a bill that
is not due until a short time after Pay-Up Week pay it during
Pay-Up Week. Make the cash hum in that week.
THIS PAY-UP WEEK 13 BECOMING NATIONAL IN ITS SCOPE.
IN THE CITIES WHERE IT HAS BEEN TRIED OUT THE RESULTS
HAVE EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS. IT HAS BROUGHT WITH IT
A SPLENDID REVIVAL OF BUSINESS. CASH HAS BEEN RE
LEASED. WHEREVER THERE'S CASH THERE'S BUSINE8S.
PAY-UP WEEK IS AN ELABORATION OF THE ENDLESS CHAIN
PROPOSITION. IT HAS THE TENDENCY TO PLACE DOLLAR8 IN
A SORT OF ENDLESS CHAIN.
Everybody in this community should take off his coat and work
for Pay-Up Week. It means a lot to you. I means a lot to every
man that lives here that has his interests here.
BOOST FOR PAY-UP WEEK.
It. will help the town.
IT WILL HELP YOU.
