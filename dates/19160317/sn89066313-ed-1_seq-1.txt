Doctor Powers. "Tlie Empire of Japan
must haw a larger bais for her popu

all, and to develop one of the perma

world If thwarted in her eftorts to
pain a foothold in China, she will
struggle to lind a place elsewhere
just where, it must hi left to the fu

taking Port Arthur and Dalny, her
only practicable commercial outlets,
the little Km pi re would become a.
mere appanage of the larger.
"Russia .Might Have Mow Mar."
"But if the Russo-Japanese War
were to be fought over again, since
Russia lias lmished double-tracking

President Rooseelt had not insisted
upon an armistice just when the tide

before the mind of Japan is that Eu

Japan Saj, "Hands Off."
"Japan realizes that the immense
natural resources or China are a
temptation to other powers to make an
India out of her. Her attitude with
respect to China is that of saving.
Hands off,' to all other nations. 'If
anybodj is going to take it, let that
somebody be Japan.' Japan must build
a bulwark sufficiently strong to hold
the West at bay, if she is to continue
to call her soul her own.
"On the otiier hand, China, with all
her dilapidation, has her own great
past and her great body of emotions
which are as dear to her as ours are
to us China sajs she will die like
Heleium rather than grant the hu
