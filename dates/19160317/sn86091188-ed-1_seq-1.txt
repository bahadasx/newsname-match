Wtr Prices of Drugs.
"Tiie war has caused a greater rise
in the price of drugs than in anything
else, at least In certain classes o
drugs," said a traveling man. Some
drugs have appreciated in value 1,5ot »
per cent."
Tiie speaker continued to say that,
while quinine lias been selling at .15
cents an ounce, the British govern
menUs recent offer of 93 an ounce
was expected to make a change all
over tiie world in tiie curreut price of
tliis widely used medicine.
"Coal tar products have risen 7oo
per cent," said Mr. Lesslug. "Drugs
are not costing tiie retailer so much,
in respect to some at least, that he
is taking chances if he lays in a large
stock for prices are bound to go down
when tiie war dises and nobody
knows how soon it will end."
Potassium permanganate is one of
the commodities that have arisen in
[price. It ha* advanced Irom 17 cents
to 11.80 Late scient! tic theories
hold that disinfectants accomplish
nothing, so it may not matter much
if it has gone up.
Other urugs which have gone up
j are bluestone, which now sells at 25

POLISH WHEAT NEW
NAME FOR OLD GRAIN
\\ ASH J NGTON, I). C., Mardi 14
—The X. S. department of agricult
ure recently lias bien informed Hist
Polish wheat Is being offered for sale
in Montana at the exorbitant price of
$1 per pound. Polish wheat is s
variety more closely related to tiie
durum wheats than to (he i-ominoii
wheats. The head is ;i io ti inches
long and one-lialf to rhree-iiuarters of
an Inch wide, usually tie»tide instead
of still. The dmtl is very long, aud
thin and papery The kernels are
larger than those of durum wheat
and about twice as long as those of
ordinary varieties of common wheat
Like those of durum wheat, the ker
nels are flinty and of a*> amber color.
A few veirs ago tills wheat was ex
ploited in Idaho under the mislead
ing name "corn wheat." It lias also
been exploited at different times as
"Jerusalem rye," "Giant rye," etc
It is grown to a slight extent in
Europe, but never lia»
southeastern
I been grown commercially in the
United States. It is carried in stock
land sold as a novelty by most seeds
I men. 11 lias been tested by many ex
periment »'allons and has never been
found to yield as well as good varie
ties of common aid durum wheat.
From our present knowledge It i* not
; recommended foi growing anywhere
I in the United States.
Those offering the seed claim ttiat
it does very well on dry land and ai
so in der irrigation if not watered
too much They state that Polish
farmers in Moutana claim that this
wir at yields from 85 to 15u bushels
per acre and makes the very nest of
flout aud ling feed.
These statements are directly con
trary tu tne experience of the depart
ment of agriculture and several state
experiment stations. They are also
contrary to tiie experience of many
firmer» who have written to the de
partment at one time or another.
The accumulated evidence «egard
iug tliis wheat «lues not indicate tiiat
it iias any value that will in any wav
Justify the charge of 41 a pound for
tiie -eed, arid farmers are advised not
to lie misled by the glowing state
ments regarding yields and value
which have been mule concerning
this variety.

Corsets For Men.
At the tailors' convention lisld in
Chicago last week it was decided that
men would look much cuter If they
wore corsets, so It was decreed tiiat
corsets should lw worn bv us fellows
ibis year. And why not? It is right
In line witii our determination to be
come a military nation. Just as soon
as we are able to order our corsets we
will put them on and with a coat cut
military style wc will give the ladles
the treat of their lives. That artistic
curve of our*, which certain knockers
refer to as "round 'shoulders'' or a
"hump" will trouble these friends
no longer. Our corset will change
this. We will order a straight hack
I osteal of a straight front.
And we will have a waist line that
will make Annette Kellerman look
like a hale of allaita with the middle
wire busted. Then with a wriat
watch and our bandana tucked up our
sleeve, we will ne the manliest man
! that ever took lemon juice In Ins tea.

'NONE BUT AMERICANS

Tbe foreign affairs committee of
the house of represents* Ives has ar
rived et tiie conclusion that none but
Americans should he planed on guard
so far as the diplomatic a->d consular
servies is concerned, and as a result
there lies been written into the dipt«
rustic and coosuiar bill a pro vial >n
barring ell foreigners from any |*»i

rivers are now eighty-two foreigners
employed as vice consuls of the Unit
ed States, if tb<- bill is passed tli me

This daurmluatlou upon the part of
the house committee le an outgrowth'
of the war, and 1» entirely owing to j
the disposition of tiie nationals of ail 1
merolat supremacy Is going on all over
countrlea to subordinate every other
Interest for the benefit of Hie home
government, a perfectly natural thing
to do. No one blames them, hut in
the future when the struggle for com
the world, it Is doubtless true that
all these poets should he tilled bv
American» in order to ohtaio the
hast results Under such condition»
there would be • much tietter oppor
tunity for trade extension and Min
or no ohanoe for double dealing The
Lord helps those who help« them
aelvev, and if the United States does
not look out for its own interest» no
other country will.
Sincerity the Primal Virtue.
The sermon Sunday »veiling st the
Methodist church was on the sub
ject, "Tile Shiest ity of Jesus."
There was a large crowd, almost till
ing the house. Underlying ail else
in Christ's life was alnosrity or love
for truth, and will) that was a great
hatred of Insincerity and falsehood.
Jesus' love for truth wa* shown in
His dealings with the leader* of the
Jews when He refused to keep silent
concerning thslr charactei Is* ic sins (
in order to gain their suoport, and In
His attitude toward those who want
ed to he 111s disciple«, for II« allowed
no one to follow Him until He had
explained to them the cost of ills dis
ci pleship.
if we analyze the »Incerity of Jesus
we ttna tint a great eelf-respect. We
all love to have the reaped of others,
hut tiie character of Jesus suggests to
us a more searching rule; U> he such
persona in our Inner life that we can
resoect ourselves. If we epply the
standard of a deep self-respect to our
own lives how oiten we will find that
our * * * * ' highest conscience Is,
not leav't undone, Hut to keep't un
known.'' However, any attempt to
appear right III the sight ol other*
without truly fating right In the
heart-life seldom succeeds very lar
even in its felee purpose: it only
serves more clearly to brand the life
as false. Old Matthews In Tiie Shep
herd of the lllils unperitood real sin
cerity when he said, "It doesn't so
much matter what other folk» think
of one. It » whet one can honestly
think of oneeelf tiiat mattere." Sin
cerity demands such a life tiiat we
need not be ashamed of what we <lo
and thlnx and are in tiie lark.
Sincerity Is so much a part of the
life of Jesu» Christ, ami Is so vitally
a part of Christianity that we have
come to recognize It as the primal
virtue. Some virtues are like seps
; rale tl iwers, they tieautlfy the laud
scape; * tew are like the climate
they are the atnxwphere in .which all
others live and flourish. Sincerity
Is one of tliese. If a man's life Is
not sltcere nothing else matter* very
i much, end nothing «Isetalmuf id* lift
can he entirely right.
