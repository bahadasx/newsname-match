: We take this occasion to re-vow

"of their worthy and able successor.

- policy and pledge to him our unqual
' Ifled and loyal support and urge ev
ery loyal America loving citizen of
the entire nation to rally to his sup
. port and re-elect him as the chief
executive of these United States.
While we earnestly hope and de-
sire that this nation shall not be en
gaged in warfare with any foreign
country yet we take this occasion to
fully endorse and approve the policy
of preparedness as advocated by our
president and urge our. representa
tives In the national congress to be in
full accord with that policy and as
sist the president in every material
way to further this plan to prevent
any possible invasion or humiliation
of our country. ' 1 v '.-
We commend and endorse the
splendid work done by the Demo
crats of the house and senate during
the last bl-ennlal period. "
We especially commend and en
dorse the conduct and course of ac
tion of the Hon. William Joel Stone
and the Hon. James A. Reed, who by
their ability, fearlessness and unqual
ified integrity have grown to be rec
ognized as the unquestioned leaders
of the United States Senate and the
right hand supporters of the Presi
dent in all of bis policies.
We do especially urge the Demo,
cratlc voters of the state of Missouri
to re-nomlnate and re-elect our dis
tinguished senator, the Hon. James
A. Reed, thereby giving the stamp of
approval to his fearless and coura
geous conduct. '
We point with pride to the Dem
ocratic administrations in this state
from the time of the Hon. Silas
Woodson to that of the Hon. Elliott
W. Major and challenge our Repub
lican opponents to point to one In
stance wherein Democratic officers
have betrayed the confidence of the
people of this state.
We call their attention to the de
velopment of the schools, charitable
institutions and development of pub
lic roads and public institutions dur
ing the administration of the affairs
by representatives of our party and
Invite them Into the folds of our par
ty to Join with us in maintaining the
development and civilization of our
state in its present high standard.
We Join with the Democracy of
the State of Missouri in presenting
to the Democracy of the United
States the name of Hon. Elliott W.
Major as our candidate for vice-pres
ident, and we call upon the loyal
Democrats of the State of Missouri
to rally to his standard and enroll
one more of our native sons as a
leader of the national Democracy.
We would call the attention of the
Democratic voters of this Congress-,
lonal District to the'fact that we have
three distinguished citizens seeking
the nomination to various state of
floes, namely: The Hon. William R.
Painter of. Carroll County, Missouri,
who is a candidate for governor, the
Hon. Major J. Lilly of Moberly, Mis
souri, who is a candidate for judge
of the Kansas City Court of Appeals
and the Hon. Frank McAllister of
Monroe County, who is a candidate
for Attorney General.
These gentlemen end each of them
are men of the highest type of
citizenship. Each Is honest, able and
eminently qualified to fill the office
to which he aspires and are Demo
crats whose fidelity is above question.
We respectfully urge that In the
coming campaign every Democrat of
this district shall carefully and ear
nestly consider these candidates and
their respective qualifications for the
offices they are seeking and will give
to them that consideration which
their qualifications merit.
We especially endorse our dis
tinguished Congressman, the Hon. W,
W. Rucker. and commend him for his
faithful and ardent support of the
administration during the trying per
lod through which U has been and
is still passing and call upon the
Democrats of this district to join
with- the Democrats of this county in
re-nominating and re-electing him
for another term.
We especially urge his re-election
at this time not only In the Interest
of this district and state, but for the
additional reason that the nation at
large requires the services of men
of his marked ability, long experience
and unquestioned integrity in facing
and dealing with ithe crisis which
now facet us.
We .commend and endorse the
splendid record, excellent services
and fearless conduct of our dis
tinguished circuit judge,, the Hon.
Fred Lamb, in the discharge of the
duties of his responsible office and
urge the voters of this Judicial cir
cuit to join with us In re-nominating
and re-electing him.
We commend and endorse the
splendid record of our distinguished
Senator,, the Hon. J. S. Wallace, and
assure him of our appreciation of his
faithful service and pledge him our
support and backing in his official
efforts.
While it is customary for conven
tlons to call attention to the achieve
ments of the great political parties,

WRECKED AUTOMOBILE
Insurance Man Sticks in Mud.
Hires Horse Power, s
Horses Kick. V' '
George Fletcher,, the' popular
Home Mutual insurance man of
Mendon was on his way to the
county capitol Monday t in his
flivver and encountered mudholes
galore as well as good roads. ... He
was in the act of sticking several
times but the trusty Ford run
about kicked her way thru until
Mr. Fletcher reached a point
three miles west of thi3 city near
the Jordan school house. Ihere
he stuck fast and to aid the toe
hold on his hind wheels, he se
cured rope and bandaged them.
He then put on the juice until
something had to come, and
something did. The differential
gearing was ripped and the
particles shot holes thru the cas
ing, a feat never accomplished;
by any other machine.
This of course, ended the
chance to get out of the hole by
his own and the machines power,
so Mr. Fletcher hunted a team
and secured the services of Ed
Courtney and his big draft horses.
The team was hitched close to
the machine and pulled it out
all right with little exertion, but
when the wheels struck solid
ground, the car refused to stop.
Mr. F. applied the foot brake
and it was out of commission.
He has but one arm and before
he could reach the emergency,
the car had run onto the horses.
This did not suit them by con
siderable and they kicked. The
way they made the front of that
car appear in an incredibly short
time, would do credit to the best
gun m the German artilery. Mr.
Fletcher was inside the car, cur
tains all up and the situation,
his location and the batteraction
of the scared horses did not suit
his idea of desirable consequences
by a whole lot, so he plunged
thru the side curtain, frog fashion

His car is out of commission
for some time. .
Judge Lamb Endorsed
Whereas, Honorable Fred
Lamb, a distinguished member
of the bar of Chariton County,
Missouri, has rendered to this
judicial district more than five
years of distinguished able ser
vice as its Judge, making a re
cord distinguished especially for
fair and courteous dealing and
business-like administration of
the affairs of his office, which
record we endorse with pride;
and,
Whereas, the learning and ju
dicial temperament which he
brought to the bench, ripened
and seasoned by years of service
and experience, give us great
confidence of even more distin
guished and able service in the
future. Therefore be it
Resolved by the Chariton
County Bar Association, that we
do most heartily endorse the
record made by Judge Lamb, and
call upon the voters of this
district to join with us in re-electing
him to this high and im
portant office.

ships but three met according to
call of county committee Tuesday
and passed resolutions, selected

speeches . delivered by home
talent in the absence of some
one from a distance. Chairman
Anderson of the county com
mittee did his best to get a popu
lar orator for the occasion, but
failed. Senator J. S. Wallace
made the hit of: the day in his
short address. Everything pas
sec off reasonably harmonious
the attempt to place the county
in an unfriendly light to our
neighbors proving abortive.

The death of William Rosen
stein at his home in Salisbury
last week marks the passing of
one of this county's best known
merchants. "Rosy," as he Was
called by his old friends, was, in
his prime, a merchant prince and
a good fellow, and Brunswick as
a center of trade for a large ter
ritory was made so by the pop
ularity of "Rosensteina Store."
The high school play last week
was a decided success. The

United States Troops in Mexico.
Villa Must Be Taken.
Mexico Aids.
The invasion of this country a
week or more ago by Villa and
his bunch of bandits sacking and
burning Columbus, Texas, killing
soldiers and civilians and escap
ing safely into the mountainous
region of his country, has brot
things to a climax and a realiza
tion of what we may expect if
we do not nip in the bud such
conduct.
General John J. Pershing has
marched into Mexico in pursuit
of Villa-with 4000 cavalry, and
more will go forward at once.
and unless the Mexicans gener
ally mass and resist, Villa will
have on his hands something he
never before encountered.
The entire United States is
one on the subject of putting a
8top to further dastardly con
duct towards our people, and
if invitations becomes necessary,
not only the Wilson administra
tion but every American citizen
advocates it. That time, men,
and much hard service will be
required to capture the nonpariel
bandit of the age, all the army
officers appear to be agreed.
EUROPEAN WAR
Germans are nearing Verdun,
France, and steadily gaining in
Persia. The fiercest fighting and
longest continued battles of the
war have been in progress for
two weeks in the vicinity of Ver
dun, the great fort town relied
on by the French to keep the
enemy out of Paris. Whether
Germans are aiming for Paris or
Calais is a matter of pure con
jecture except to the Germans.
Several battleships and a num
ber of merchatmen have been
sunk the past week, all charged
to German submarines and
mines, but in many cases there is
reasonable doubt about the Ger
mans having had anything to do
with the destruction of the ships,
notably in the English channel.
New Livery Firm
Edgar Tisdale, member of the
principal livery firm of this city,
sold his interest this week to
John Garnett and the new firm
will be Adams & Garnett Wil
liam B. Adams and John Garnett.
This wiH prove a good combina
tion, both being good horsemen
and with the prospect of at
least one of the firm being found
at the barn occasionally, the
public will find all that can be
asked of a public service institu
tion. Celebrates "Thirteenth" Birthday

of the Central Iron Works of
Quincy. Soon after his marriage
Mr. Roling engaged in business
in Monroe City. After two
years in that city he removed to
Salisbury in 1892, purchasing the
machine shop in this place. By
hard work, economy and thrift
and fair and courteous dealing,
Mr. Roling has won a large meas
ure of success, and obtained a
high place in the esteem of the
citizens of this place. His busi
ness has grown from humble
proportions to one of the largest
of its kind in this section of the
state, and two sons are now en
gaged with him in the; business.
