FIRE IN SHACKETT'S MARKET.
The Middlebury fire department was
kept busy for aevernl hours Saturdny
night when it was called to extinguish
two fires in the market of Frank Shack
ett, jr., on Main street. The first alarm
was turned in at about 11 o'clock by J.
F. Nova', who conducta a shoe store in
the same building. The fire started, it
is thought, from a stove in the oflicu of
Mr. Shackett's market. The firemen
with the use of chemicals soon had the
fire extinguished. About 12:45 Sunday
morning an alarm was sounded for an
other fire in the same building. The
fire was found to be in a box of paper
which had been carried out during the
first fire and returned and which had
been smouldering for several hours.
The blaze was quickly extinguished.
The building is owned by J. W. Law
rence, anil the damage is estimated at
$200. The damage to stock is about
$400. The damage to both building and
stock is covered by insurance. The
uther occupants of the building, Mr.
Novak and the Catholic Order of For
esters, were shghtly damaged by smoke.
Mr. Shackett will conduct his husiness
tcmporarily from his residence.

At the opening Attomcy S. Hollister
Jackson of Barre nppenred for granite
firms in Bnrre. Hnrold B. Hinmnn,
Secrctary of tho Barro Granite Mnnu
facturers' Associnti'ti, which consists
of 1G" granite mnnufncturera, about
07 percentof the granite firms, tcstified
that about .'1800 men are employed by
these firms. $2,000,000 is invested in
tho munufncturing plants and the an-
nunl outputof finished products is up-
proximatcly $6,000,000. Eirorts aro
being made to increase the business,
$30,000 having recently been rnised for
a national advertising cumpnign during
tho next eight months. Grnruto for
memorial purposes will be the chief
product advcrtised. Mngazines liko the
Saturday evening Post and tho World's
work will be used.
Mr. Hinmnn presented a petition by
the Granite Manufacturers' Association
urging tho admission of a new source
of power to the Barre district.
Alexander Duncnn, President of the
Granite Manufacturers Association,
tcstified that quarry work used to be
done by mnnual labor, "physical cul
ture" he called it, but that now machin-
ery is employed very largely, increasing
tho demand for electrical power. Long
sh ds are now used, with traveling
cranes, instead of the old semi-circular
sheds in which derricks were employed
to move the granite. Lnrger polishing
machines are being introduced, and
these also require more power, as also
a now improved sharpening machine
and the dust removers now installed for
protection of the henlth of the men.
Mr. Duncan said that in 1912-13 tho
manufacturers oxperienced great diffi
culty in getting a steady supply of
power, especially in the dry season. In
the fall of 1913 steam plants for the
production of electricity were installed,
since when there had been no difiiculty
as to power.
Mr. George Varnum, superintendent
of the Boutwell, Milne & Varnum
quarries of Barre, took the stand at the
' af ternoon session and testilied that his
firm had installed steam power because
ihey belicved it cheaper than electricity
as at present furnished by the Mont
pelier and Barre Light and Power Co.,
and also more dependable.
Mr. E. O. Kent, Treasurer of E. L.
Smith &Co., another Barre quarrying
company, employing about 200 men in
four quarries, testified that his com
pany had had some trouble with the
present supply of electrical power in
Barre, but that the service had recent
ly improved. On cross exumination he
admitted the authorship of a letter
which stated that the service had been
very satisfactory.
Iloward T. Sands, of the Montpelier
and Barre Light and Power Co., testi
fied that prior to 1912 the power situa-
, tion in Barre was acute, the manufac
( turers expcriencing great difiiculty, but
that two days after his company took
over the inanagement improvements
were begun, new and extcnsive nd
ditions being installed. The company
now has a capacity of 12,800 K. W. II.
The total connected load at present is
G5 per cent of this capacity. In addition
the company owns other powers in
Marshfield and Middlesex which are
soon to be developed, which will bring
the total capacity up to 23,000 K. W. II.

MIDDLEBURY BANK TO INSTALL
NEW STATEMENT MACHINE.
The National Bank of Middlebury
will instnll April 1st the Burroughs
combinntion 1 dger posting and stnte
ment machine. By the machine method,
all the work of recording nnd figuring
customers' nccounts is handled on a
bookkeeping machine. Checks and de
posits are entered on the ledgcrs, and
the necessary addition and subtrnction
is done automatically, and with no
chance for error.
The sheet contnining the record of nc
count is placed in the machine nnd the
old balance printed in the proper
column. Then nny checks that hnve
been drawn are listed and subtracted
automatically from the old balance. If
a deposit'has been mado, this is printed
in the deposito column, and added, and
the new balance is ready to be printed
by aimply pressing a key and operating
the machine.
A statement of any account, which is
a duplicate of the ledger page, is posted
every day from the origionnl checks
and deposit slips. This statement is
handed to depositors on or about the
first of the month, and shows all checks
drawn and deposits made, and gives
balance at the end of the month.
This system, then, affords double
protection against any and all errors in
figuring as it is impossible for the
machine to make a mistake, and pro
tection against mistakes of other kinds
by means of the checking back of
atatements with the ledger.
By comparing the statement nnd
ledger sheets each day any mistake
of the bookkeeper in reading an amount
wrong or in charging a check to the
wrong account can be detected.
