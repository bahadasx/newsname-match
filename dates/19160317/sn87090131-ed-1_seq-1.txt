GETTING A START
I NATHANIEL FOWLER, J
(L upynghi. 1915. by the Mo.gi,e Ncwraya.z bynduact.) i
THE INVENTOR.
Statistics are misleading, but I may
say in passing that millions of patents
have been issued, and that thousax.ds
oa mew inventions are patented yearly.
The patent office will grant a patent
for a new discovery or invention, irre
spective of itd commercial or other
worth, the patent examiners basing
their decisions upon the newness of
the thing patented entirely regardless
of its intrinsic value.
Inventions have been made by both
sexes, and by people of all ages. in
cluding the immature youth. Some of
them have brought fortunes; but the
majority of patents are worth prac
tically nothing, and many a good dis
covery or invention, through lack of
development and exploitation, has not
contributed anything to its originator.
A successful invention is dependent
upon two conditions: First, the com
mercial or other value of the thing it
self; secondly, proper development.
Comparatively few inventors or
scientific men have business ability,
and the majority do not understand
the marketing of the products of their
ingenuity. They can invent, but they
cannot exploit They can discover,
but they cannot distribute.
While a few great inventions have
been the result of chance or accident,
the majority of profitable patents are
the result of education and training.
combined with unceasing research.
Mere brightness and ingenuity are not
sufficient. I am inclined to think that
the inventor comes by his talent nat
urally and that he cannot produce it.
If you are ingenious and original
and would invent, first train yourself
along the line of your proposed course.
Secondly, do not invent in a haphaz
ard manner. Study conditions by re
search, ascertain what is wanted,
what can be used, what will be used if
properly presented. Then attempt to
meet this demand. When the idea is
born, search the patent records, for
the chances are that someone else has
forestalled you. By quiet and more
or less secret inquiry attempt to dis
cover whether or not what you have is
marketable. Then consult a reputable
patent lawyer or solicitor. If you do
not know of one. ask the judge of the
court, or some high-class attorney at
law, to recommend one. Place your
self unreservedly in his hands, for no
reliable patent lawyer or solicitor has
ever been known to betray his clients.
After the patent is issued to you, get
into communication with concerns
manufacturing similar articles, or ap
pearing to do so; and either sell your
patent outright or arrange for a roy
alty. The chances are a thousand to
one that you cannot properly handle it
yourselt
Bear in mind one thing: the result
of ingenuity is worthless unless it
can be used either commercially or for
the benefit of humanity. Financial
profit comes only to those who pro
duce something which will sell.
You may be perfectly convinced of
the value of your invention, but, un
less you can make the public realize
its worth, you cannot hope to win
fame or fortune from it First, be sure
that you 'have something which the
world needs, then make every effort to
show the world that you have some
thing very much worth its considera
tion, by placing it in the hands of men
you can trust, men who have the capi
tal and ability to develop it Don't
try to do it yourself unless you have
both money and business acumen.
Trivial Annoyances.
It is surprising how trivial are the
annoyances which suffice to make
some men miserable. A lump of soot
falling on a man's linen; a beefsteak
overdone; losing a railway train by
forty seconds, after running himself
out of breath; a visit from a bore when
he is overwhelmed with cares; the
rasptng of his nerves by a hand organ
when he is weary, inclined to head
ache or trying to sleep; even the want
of a pin, or a shirt button flying off at
an unlucky moment, as when he tis
dressing for a dinner party and has
scant time in which to do it-all these
are annoyances which sorely try a
man's patience and chafe and vex
many a person more than a serious
misfortune.
Alexander Smith goes so far as to
say that if during thirty years all the
annoyances brought on with defalat
ing shirt buttons alone could be gath
ered into a mass and endured at once,
it would be misery equal to a publio
execution.
Arizona Cactl.
Arizona has more than a hundred
kinds of cacti, and Tucson is the cen
ter of the great cactas region of the
Bouthwest. These odd plans range in
sise from the noble Sahuara or Giant
cactus, forty or Aifty feet high, to
small pin-cushion acti an inch or two
in diameter. Sahuaas grow in great
abundance in the foothills betwedh
Tucson and Tuma and mare always ob
jects of weoader. It is beleved a large
plant is at least two kuandred years od.

YES OR NO.
Mr. C. E. E. Ussher is the passen
ger traffic manager of the Canadian
Pacific railway, the longest railroad
in the world. He conic 'net help be
ing loaded with experience, for his
activities extend across the continent
and over two oceans.
The other day I asked him to say
a few words before one of my busi
ness classes. He made the shortest
speech of the year-just sixty words
and every one of them weighed a ton.
He said:
"Young ladies are popularly sup
posed to be concerned chiefly with
the words 'Yes' and 'No;' but, judg
ing by my forty years' experience,
you, who will be stenographers, are
chiefly concerned with the word 'Not.'
If it be omitted, and the stenographer
makes one say 'I am willing,' when he
really said 'I am not willing,' great
trouble results."
Millions of dollars have been lost
because a telegraph operator wired
a stock broker to buy, when the mes
sage read not to buy.
Even more millions of dollars have
been sidetracked because some stenog
rapher wrote "I will." instead of "I
will not." and her employer signed
the letter without reading it-care
less of him, of course-with a re
sultant tremendous loss.
The moral world, as well as the
business world, swings on "Yes" and
"No," "I will" and "I will not."
Saying "yes" at the right time may
stand for success, and saying "No"
at the wrong time may encourage fail
ure.
"I will do it" may be the phrase
which carries you into prominence,
and "I will not do It" inay save your
money and your reputation.
If you are a stenographer, learn the
use of "yes" and "no." "I will" and
"I will not," and never write them
into a letter, or repeat them, unless
you are sure that you understood
your employer aright; and then, it
you are certain that you did, but have
a suspicion that what he said was not
what he meant, be careful.
The clerks who rise from the ranks
are those who do not follow direc
tions blindly. They understand the
why, and when they write out what is
told them, or speak the words which
they have been ordered to deliver,
they have back of them the certainty
that they are following directions, and
the further guaranty, due to their
judgment, that what their employer
said he meant to say.
First of all be accurate. In taking
shorthand notes, use the utmost care.
In delivering messages, use the ut
most care. In carrying out the most
important orders, in carrying out the
least important orders, use the utmost
care. And with that care, employ
your brains.
Think! If a note, if a message, if
an order, seems strange to you, think
It over quietly. If it still seems
strange after you have given it
thought, if you can see no reason
for It, go to the one who is responsi
ble for it and learn the why, or at
least be assured that you have made
no mistake. No man wants an em
ployee who does not think, nor does
he want one who will follow orders
blindly. He is not intallible. Some
day he may make a mistake, and he
will then appreciate-perhaps substan
tially-the clerk who thinks, and
shows that he thinks.
Rainfall in Hawall.
The rainfall on the island of Hawaii
varies greatly, ranging from the enor
mous downpour of 353 inches a year
in the upper Walpio valley to 20 inches
a year on the northeast coast between
Hilo and Kohala. The Walpio surface
streams on the island are found along
the northeast coast between Hllo and
Kohala. The only river, according to
the United States geological survey,
is the largest stream on the island,
and has been party developed for irri
gation. At Kapoho, on the east point
of the island, warm water flows from
seams in the rocks. These "warm
springs" flow Into a pool about 100
feet long, 25 feet wide'and 20 feet
deep. The pool is entirely surrounded
by rocks and its color varies in shade
from a beautiful blue to violet. Wal
pele, or Green lake. Is a body of fresh
water in the pit of an old crater near
Kapoho. This lake covers an area of
about five acres and is fed by springs
below the surface. A pumping plant
takes water from this lake for domes
tie use and for irrigation.
Birds That Have Their Own Way.
The ways of birds are hard to un
derstand. For yeas the Canadinn au
thorities have been trying in vain to
