We Strike Now
A United People
"Watchful waiting" is the
football of every cawing raven of
the Republican press. The "I
told you so" boys are right on
I hand shouting with great glee
I that they have been urging a
! blood tribute for three years and
j that Wilson has again reversed
jhimsell. They beat the phrase
about like a puppy does a ball.
We do not deny that they have
had the blood lust, straining at
the leash to get at a neighbor's
tin oat. But isn't what has hap
pened just what Mr. Wilson
meant when he coined the phrase.
Not once has the administration
: said that it would not go into
Mexico, but that it was watching
and waiting.
No matter how much revolu
tion was going on down there we
have had no cause to invade the
territory of a friendly nation un
til an overt act was committed,
i he ravens are printing long lists
of American people who have
been killed in Mexico since th-i
policy of waiting and watching
began. But in nearly every case
:t will be found that those people
were gambling with their lives
in taking chances and had no
business there.
But it takes an overt act to
start nearly every great national
j event. A mob in the streets of
Paris gave France its Napoleon,
• spilling ol tea in Boston harboi
gave the American revolution its
momentum, John Brown at Harp
er's Ferry made the rebellion
certain, the Liowmg up of the
; Maine started the war with
Spain. Now we have an organ
ized assault on Columbus by a
; body of men from a friendly ter
ritory that coupe's us to act in a
drastic manner.
And what is the result of watch
ful waiting? We go in there as
a united people. No man, fror;
Bryan, the chief of pacifiste,
down, has raised his voice agains'
it. Had we rushed in there an
yone to killing in a way to make
V ilia ashamed so soon as th<.
Mexicans began fighting amon.u
themselves,and incidentally hurt
ing Americans who got caught.
; there, we would not have been
agreed on it. We know what
that means, do we not?
Wilson has been willing to sit
by and take calumny and abuse
knowing that time would show
him right. But he has only en
dured what Abraham Lincoln did
before he signed an act freeing
American slaves. This same type
that has assailed Wilson nearly
: drove Lincoln crazy. When the
time came to act and freeing the
slaves as a military measure
served to break the back of the
confederacy Lincoln did not hes
itate. Neither has Wilson.—Bil
lings Journal.

A Firmer In
Some
Terrible Plight
It is related that a farmer liv
ing not so far from here recently
experienced a dream, to him
most harrowing in detail, but in
which he was given a vision of
som things in a new light and
from which he drew a moral and
brought ultimate wealth and hap
piness to others.
In the dream it came to him
that he had disposed of his wheat
crop of some 1800 bushels (his
total crop, by the way), and that
he had sold this wheat not to an
elevator or dealer, but to 1800
different customers—a bushel to
each. A few of the purchasers
paid up at once but the great
majority did not. The total a
mount, if collected, would have
brought him a sufficient income
to tide him over till his next
crop, but under these conditions
he could not collect for his wheat
fast enough to keep his children
supplied with shoes and meet his
other small current expenses.
"Most of these men may be
depended upon to pay their
bills," he soliloquized, "but how
am 1 going to keep my family
and conduct my business while
awaiting their convenience? 1
cannot leave my farm work and
run all over the state in an effort
to collect all these small ac
counts."
And the majority of the buy
err reasoned somewhat in this
vwse: ' 1 his amount is too small j
•< amount to anything, and he|
o.i't need it or worry about it. '
there's no hurry, Iii hand it to
him some time."
The individual amounts were
all small, true enough, but in the
aggregate they meant a great
'leal to the farmer, who was hav
, .
mg a hard time to make ends
meet.
In Iiis struggles and herculean
efforts to find a way out of his
difficulties the dreamer fell out
of bed and awoke. Running
quickl y to h is g r anary he found;
ins 1800 bushels of grain still in
tact, and he was most thankful '
to discover that he had only.
However, the hallucination left
a profound impression on h i s
mind, and he was unable to find
sleep when he returned to his
bed. Thinking over his dream
and considering the plight of any .
, , , , , !
farmer or stockman who would
.... , .
dispose of his oroducts in such a
I
,, , , .
;uddeniy struck
manner, he was
by an inspiration.
Wnen the local editor arrived
at his office the next morning he
found this farmer awaiting him.
"I am behind on my paper," he
said, and I am here to pay up. ]
have been putting it off because
it was only a few dollars and I
thought vou. would not worry a
bout it. However, in a dream
last night I occupied the position
"f a newspaper man, having my
>urce of income scattered all ov
er the country in small accounts.
Hereafter when it comes time
■or me time for me to pay up,
.vou may depend upon my being!
1; re promptly. "—Ex.
