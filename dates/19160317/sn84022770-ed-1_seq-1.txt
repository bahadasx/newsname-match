MANY NEW ENTRIES
FOR SCHOOL CONTEST
VARIOUS FEATURES ADDED IN
PLANS FOR 1010 AGRICULTUR
AL-INDUSTRIAL EXHIBIT.
Fosters announcing the details of
the annual agricultural and indus
trial contest of the schools of the city
and county, to be held in connection
with the Second Annual County Fair,
September 11 to 16, are being sent
to each teacher in the county by Bu
peritnendent O. C. Goss, to be posted
In each room as a constant reminder
of the contest to the pupils. Hitherto
this information has been published
In a booklet, but Superintendent
GOBB believes that in the new form,
featuring also the value of the prizes
to be awarded each entry, the pupils
will receive still greater encourage
ment in preparing for teh contest.
Details of the contest were decided
upon at a meeting of the special com
mittee Friday night. Superintendent
GOSB is chairman, the other members
being Principals E. H. Evans of the
Garfield school, W. L. Miller of Bu
coda, B. W. Gibson of South Bay, and
W. E. McGuire of Tumwater. They
revised the entire list of entries, pro
viding various new features, and also
authorised the superintendent to
divide the county into several dis
tricts in which preliminary exhibits
are to be held, the winners of which
will enter the county contest. The
present plan Is to hold these com
munity exhibits at Tumwater, Tenlno,
Telm, Little Rock, Gate, Rochester
and Olympia, though one or two
other places may later be selected.
Special Vegetable Exhibit.
Particular effort is to be directed
this year to encourage entries for the
largest prise in the contest, a special
prise of |5 for the beet Individual
exhibit of vegetables containing at
least eight different kinds of prod
ucts, with a second prise of |2. This
special prise was offered last year but
there were no entries.
In the home economics department,
the following new entries were
authorised: Best plate of dough
nuts, best loaf of graham bread, best
plain apron and best centerpiece. In
the agricultural department, because
there were several fine exhibits of
field corn last year for which no
prises were offered this year's prise
list provides for entries for the best
six ears of white field corn and the
best six years of yellow, and also for
the best exhibit of parsnips. The
first prises in this department will be
worth f1.60 and the second 91. being
higher than those offered in the state
contest at Takima or the Southwest
Washington Fair at Chehalls.
Prises for Best Maps.
In the manual training department,
in place of mechanical drawing,
which is not taught in the schools
outside Olympia, the list provides
prizes for the best ink map of Thurs
ton county showing the principal
towns and rivers, for the best molded
physical (relief) map of the state,
and for the beat water color speci
men, while there are also special
prizes for basketry exhibited by
pupils of grades below the seventh.
Another feature of this year's con
test will be prizes for the youngest
pupils of the schools, who have been
left out heretofore. For their ben
efit prizes will be offered pupils In
the second, third and fourth grades
for the best examples of weaving such
articles as mats or rugs.
City Inspection Under Way.

Clerk W. A. Hoage about a month
ago, that the work be undertaken at
this time when the city 1B taking over
the operation of Ita waterworks sys

changes in bookkeeping methods, the

state highway department for the last
three years, was appointed state high
way commissioner by Governor Lis
ter Wednesday, to succeed William

Commissioner Allen in turn appoint
ed former Mayor George F. Cotterill
of Seattle and an engineer of high

ceived with much pleasure by his
many local friends as well as those
he has made throughout the state in
the last three years in his work ag
chief engineer of the department. It
had generally been thought locally he
would be named, as most of the re
sponsibility of the department has
fallen on his shoulders and it was
generally felt that he was entitled to
the promotion. He is a well known
Olympian, having been born and
raised here, and is the son of Mrs. T.
N. Allen.
Mr. Cotterill was an applicant for
the commissionership and presented
many Indorsements for the place, and
hiß selection as chief engineer of ths
department is generally looked upon
as an excellent one.

by Governor Lister this week as
"Arbor and Bird Day," in a procla
mation In which he urged "that on
that day there be carried out by indi
viduals, In the public schools, and by

in the planting of trees and shrub

,of grounds and gardens, and the

GILLIES PREPARES
TO APPEAL GASE
SENTENCES PASSED ON HIM AND
STONE TUESDAY END
LOCAIi TRIALS.
With 90 days in which to appeal
his cases to the state supreme court,
if he desires and as he says he in
ance commission who was found
claim agent of the Industrial insur
ance commission woh was found
guil*y of forgery and grand larceny
in connection with the frauds in that
department and was sentenced to a
minimum of approximately seven and
a half years on both charges, will
probably remain In the county jail
until this statutory period expires.
The court records in both cases
have been perfected, to permit of ap
peal, but the state authorities scout
reports that the convicted man will
take such a course. Frank Stone,
hia confessed accomplice, who
changed his plea, to guilty when ar
raigned last. Tuesday afternoon and
received a sentence of from 1 to 80
years, will not be taken to Walla
Walla until after the trial of Arthur
(Monk) Toung, the former Tacoma
saloonkeeper. In the Pierce county
courts.
Sentences Pined Tuesday.
The concluding chapter* of Hbe
trials, for a time at least, ao
far as the local courts are concerned,
were written Tuesday, when Judge
D. F. Wright sentenced Oillles to an
additional. term of one year In the
penitentiary and costs, and Judge
John R. Mitchell gave Frank W.
Stone, confessed forger of bogus
accident claims, after he had altered
his plea of "not guilty" to "guilty,"
a sentence of one year at hard labor.
Gillies was charged with forgery
and grand larceny on two counts and
was convicted of forgery and one one
of the grand larceny charges. Judge
J. R. Mitchell last week sentenced
him to four and one-half years on
the forgery conviction and Judge
Wright gave him an additional sen
tence of one year, making the total
sentence on the two convictions 5%
years. In addition both judges as
sessed costs against the defendant,
which consist solely ofVitness fees,
and aggregate $2,157.60, f1.562.30
for the first trial and $796.20 for the
second. At the rate of $S a day Gil
lies will have to serve about two
years more, making his minimum
sentence 7% years.
Stone Changes Plea.
Stone faced two charges, forgery
and grand larceny, being charged
with grand larceny Jointly with Gil
lies and E. W. Kearns, Olympla sa
loonkeeper. Gillies will never go to
trial on the joint charge, while
Kearns* motion for a dismissal of that
charge on the ground that the 60-day
limit had expired, was granted last
week, the state making on resistance.
On motion of Attorney Thomas
O'Leary, acting for Stone, Tuesday,
Judge Mitchell likewise dismissed the
joint grand larceny charge against
Stone on the same ground, leaving
only the forgery charge.
Stone was brought Into court and
changed his former plea of "not
guilty" to one of "guilty." He was
then sentenced to one year in the
penitentiary by Judge Mitchell. Stone
turned state's evidence against Gil
lies, confessing that he forged all
! bogus accident claims and also forged
the Indorsements on the illegal war
rants at the direction and dictation of
Gilllea.

cret. No sharp developments are ex
pected until after Friday. A smaller
column, headed by Col. George A./
Dodd, has entered Mexico some dis
tance west of Columbus, N. M.
The American expedition was pro
voked by the attack by Villa and his
force upon Columbus, N. M., the lat
ter part of last week. An exchange
of notes between President Wilson
and Carranza of the de facto Mexican
government has established the statu
of the campaign as not of the nature
of an intervention, and the latest re
ports telling of instructions Issued by
Carranca's secretary of war to co
operate in every way with the United
States forces, have relieved all fears
of trouble between the governments.
Increase Army to 190,000.
While war and state departments
were busy with matters connected
with the expedition, congress com
pleted the work began Tuesday, the
senate concurring in the house reso

After devoting all of Tuesday to
bearing arguments In the aalt of va
