LABOR'S ACTIVITIES
CHEAP LIVING" CRY
OPPOSED BY EDITOR
HILLINGS, Mont.—Editor Buck of
the Yellowstone Labor News believes
workers should pay more attention
to higher wages and less to the many
"cheap living - ' movements abroad in
the land. He says:
About every so often we read about
some one who has solved the problem
of ' heap living' and every capitalist
paper in the country gives the 'cheap
living' fanatic oodles of space In
which to set forth, in much detail, his
recipe for cheap living.
"There is an object in this 'cheap
living' agitation.
"The cheaper the workers can he
iduced to live the cheaper they will
be compelled to work.
"The wages of the workers are, as
a general rule, regulated by the cost
of what is actually necessary to fur
nish the three things necessary to life,
i.e.. food, clothing and shelter.
"If the worker will consent to get
along with less food, less clothing
and less shelter, thus making it pos
sible for him to live on less wages,
be will soon find that the employers
have taken advantage of his consent
to the lower standard and they will
compel him to also accept a lower
wage.
"The only exception to this rule is
in the case of the organized workers.
Through their collective strength they
are able to demand a higher wage
and as a consequence enjoy a better
standard of living.
"The workers should disregard en
tirely all attempts to foist on them
the 'cheap living' idea, and devote
:heir attention to the question of how
to solve the problem, not of how to
live cheap hut how to live well."

KILLED LAST YEAR!
LOW DEATH RATE IN MINES
WASHINGTON. —Of the 750,000
men employed in coal mining last
year, 2,264 were killed, the lowest
death rate in the past 16 years, ac
cording to bureau of mines figures,
just made public. The number of
men killed is actually the lowest in
the last eight years, despite the in
creasing number of men employed.
The number of tons of coal produced
for each miner killed is the largest in
(He history of the coal mining indus
try in this country.
If this decrease continues it will
soon be as safe to go to work as to
go to war.
MANY WORKERS HURT
HARRISBURG, Pa.—lnjuries were
sustained by 13,027 workers in Penn
sylvania industrial plants during the
first 16 days of February, an average
of almost 1,000 on every working day.
Several times during that period more
than 1,000 men were injured on a sin
gle day. The highest daily record of
injured workmen was 1,190. During
the first 16 days of February 92 work
ers were killed.
This number does not include 27
fatalities in one mine catastrophe in
western Pennsylvania and several
other fatalities. Accident reports, re

January 13,465 workers were injured,
including 129 killed.

CRIME AGAINST LABOR
(From Committee on Industrial Rela
tions, Washington, D. C.)
WASHINGTON.—Frank P. Walsh,
chairman ot the Committee on Indus
trial Relations, recently made public
a letter to Commissioner of Educa
tion P. P, Claxton demanding a re
pudiation by him of a pamphlet on
industrial education prepared hy the
National Association of Manufactur
ers and distributed under government
authority by the Bureau of Education.
The letter follows:
Hon. P. P. Claxton,
Commissioner, Bureau of Education,
Department of Interior,
Washington, D. C.
Dear Sir- —
I have at hand a copy of a pamph
let entitled, "Report of the Commit
tee on Industrial Education, H. E.
Miles, Chairman of the National As-j
sociation of Manufacturers." At the
bottom of the cover are printed the
words: "Reprinted for Distribution by.
Bureau of Education, Washington, D. i
C."
I am reliably informed that the Na- j
tional Association of Manufacturers j
furnished you with thousands of j
these pamphlets under an agreement,;
on your part, to send them broadcast
throughout the country under the au-,
thority of the United States govern
ment.
I cannot too strongly protest against
the action of a government official, I
appointed and paid to promote the.
education of the nation's youth, in'
thus giving recognition, sanction and i
approval to an organization which
has been discredited in the minds of
all decent citizens who are familiar
with its record as a corrupting agen
cy in public life and a champion of
the grossest and most shameful forms
of exploitation.
At the very time when you were
engaged in spreading the propaganda
of this organization, its official leg
islative representative, the notorious
J. A. Emery, was appearing before
committees of congress in opposition
jto the Keating child labor bill, and
;he there stated that, in attempting to
block legislation to keep children un
der fourteen ou tof southern cotton
mills, he was acting for the board of
directors of the association whose lit
erature you are distributing.
A report on the industrial educa-'
tion of our children, published by
such an organization, would, to those
familiar with its records, carry as
much weight and no more than a re
port on the moral welfare of Ameri
can girls if issued by a notorious
band of procurers.
Yet, by lending the government
stamp and approval to this document,
you have placed it in the hands of
thousands of men and women who
may be deceived by this misuse of
government authority, and whose
views on the greatest educational is
sue of the time may thus be uncon
sciously perverted.
Without giving the pamphlet an in
stant's consideration, it should have
LABOR INJURED BY LAW
COMPENSATION ACT WEAKENED
FRANKFORT, Ky.— The state sen
ate has amended the proposed work
men's compensation act and friends
of this legislation declare that as it
now reads the measure has no effect
or value. The blow which crippled
the act strikes out the section which
removes the common law defenses of
contributory negligence, assumption
of risk and fellow servant relation
from any damage suit brought against
an employer who had decided not to
accept the provisions of the law.
With this section removed employers
will not avail themselves of the com
pensation law, because there Is no
inducement to do so. Advocates of
compensation show that the damage
suit attorney will flourish as of yore
if the section is not reinstated by the
house.
At the last session of the state leg
islature a compensation law was
passed only to be declared unconsti
tutional on the ground that it limited
the amount of damages in case of
death. The present opposition is but
a continuance of this struggle con
ducted by trade unionists.
THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE
DEVOTED TO THE INTEREST
EVERETT, WASH., FRIDAY, MARCH 17, 1!)1<;.
been enough for you that il was pub
lished by the National Association of
Manufacturers, an organization that
has earned the contempt of the Amer
ican people.
But. on reading your pamphlet, I
find, in comparing it with Emery's
statements before the congressional
committees, that the advantage is all
with Emery.
This representative of the National
Association of Manufacturers brazen
ly defended the exploitation of the
little children on financial grounds,
whereas the pamphlet circulated by
you undertakes to disguise this pur
pose by hypocritical expressions of
BOCilitude and sentiment, couched in
the familiar cant phrases with which
the Pecksnlffian uplifter vainly en-
.' deavors to gloss over the hideous
facts found in the economic and in
! dustrial field.
.1 The purpose is apparent, through
lout, to still further stimulate child
labor, and, at the same time, to throw
j about, it a mantle of respectability.
| More children are to be diverted into
j industry at a tender age, if the hopes
jof the National Association of Manu
facturers, as here set forth, are real-
I ized, and they are to be made more
skillful, in order that the wages of
their fathers can be still further de
, pressed, and boy and girl set against
j father and mother in the killing strug
| gle for bread.
Thus, the pamphlet report? an em
! ployer as saying, on a visit to an in
dustrial school conducted under the
dual system of control:
"Why, I pay ten dollars a day for
' the kind of work that fifteen year old
| boy is doing."
Supplementing its defense of the
. dual system of control, by which in
industrial education is to be adminis
tered by a separate boaru and class
j divisions thus emphasized, the pamph-
? let says:
i "Business men must largely deter
mine the character of these schools,
i if they are to be worth while."
i Rut, above all, I direct your par
ticular attention to the author's fal
sification of the facts regarding child
i labor, making it appear that children
i enter factories for other reasons than j
the true one —that they are driven
' there by the payment to their fathers j
of wages too low to keep their fami
. lies alive.
Says this report circulated by you,
under the stamp of the 1 nited States
government:
"Children do not leave school at
fourteen simply because they are
| fourteen, nor because tlie law allows,
but because they are adolescent. At i
adolescense the will and the creative
faculties assert themselves. Says
Carlyle, 'All true work is sacred. In
all true work, be it hut true hand la
bor, there's something divine.' In the
impulse of the adolescent child to go
to work at fourteen there is, after all,
a reaching for the divine. In the
child's hunger for the world of work
and of real things is a tiny reflection
of that Infinite Spirit which in seven
days made the world.''

written hy a wealthy manufacturer
and published by an association of
men whose sons and daughters re
main In school and college for eight
years after they reach the age of
fourteen, and, even then, seldom en J
gage In productive toil, it is a plain
falsification of the facts, regarding a
system that uses hunger to force the
children of the poor into mines and
factories just at the time when they
should he best able to receive in
struction that would fit (hem for the
appreciation and enjoyment of the
finer things of life, with the sacrile
gious suggestion that God has aban
doned the little ones, and is on the
side of the men who are crushing out
their lives in mine and factory.
Continuing his argument, the au
thor of this pamphlet, which you
have so widely circulated, says:
"Let us remember, too, that sub
stantially all the working people of
the world have quit school at this
early age, and are likely to as far
ahead as we can see."
If your government bureau made a
practice of sending broadcast all pub
lications on the subject of industrial
education, some palliation might be
found for your conduct. But I found
that you have not distributed the re
port of the government commission
which investigated this subject. Nor
have you circulated the declaration of
the American Federation of Labor,
representing two million organized
workers of this country, adopted at
the annual convention in San Fran
cisco, in November last, and which
said:
"In approving industrial education,
equal attention should be given to the
general studies and requirements of
the school children. The convention
believes the latter of greater import
■ ance to the future welfare of the work
i ers than the former instruction. In
dustrial education shall include the
teaching of the science underlaying
tlie various industries and industrial
disputes, being taught their historic,
economic and social bearings."
The Committee on Industrial Rela
tions demands of you a quick repudia
tio nof the pamphlet which you have
distributed, and an assurance that
any additional literature on this sub
ject, or any other, connected with the
education of the American youth.
I which the National Association of
Manufacturers may issue, shall not
be given the stamp of the United
Slates Rureau of Education, by your
self or any other public official, nor
distributed under government frank.
Unless this request is complied
with, the opponents of child labor ev
erywhere will be asked to petition
I the president to remove you from of

DEMAND OF
THE 8-HOUR
The organized labor movement of

I Gompers of the American Federation
[of Labor, "a human being with Intel
lectual desires and cravings."
The Labor Center Association of
New York City has just recently giv
en fine assistance to labor to express
and get before the American public
its righteous demands for the eight
hour day. All groups and organiza
tions and agencies of publicity that
recognize the rights of labor are giv
ing voice to the same compelling
demand.
The splendid work of Samuel Gom
pers, voicing the organized labor
movement, has placed the eight-hour
day on an impregnable rock of jus
tice and righteousness. President
Gompers said:
"The individual who works eight
hours or less does not each day ex
hause his energy. He has time for
recuperation and something more.
His mind is more alert and active.
He Is capable of more effective work.
He goes to and from work at a time
when well-dressed people are on the
streets. He really has time and op
portunity for making comparisons
and forming desires. He has longer
time to stay at home, sees other
homes better furnished, and conse
quently wants a better home for him
self. He wants books, pictures, enter
tainment, friends. In short, he be
comes a human being with intellec
tual desires and cravings. This
change makes him a more valuable
worker. Because his standard of liv
ing has changed he demands higher
wages. Men and women will not con
tinue indefinitely to work for wages

SAYS FRASER
Supreme Court Ruling Causes Much
Interest Among Citizens
The United States supreme court
decision declaring the Washington
state law requiring a license of $6000
from every firm using these stamps
caused much interest in Everett. The
outcome was regarded with satisfac
tion or disappointment according as
those interested felt they were af
fected by the ruling of the court.
DOESN'T AFFECT S. & H.
W. R. Fraser, local manager of the
Sperry & Hutchinson Trading Stamp
Company, said the decision wouldn't
affect his company. He said:
"Whenever any legislation is passed
in which our company is interested it
is the policy of the company to com
ply with the requirements of the law
rather than to fight it This our com
pany did in this case.
"A tobacco company was directly
concerned in that case and it made
a motion for re-argument, so that the
litigation is not yet ended.
"However, whatever the outcome,
the S. & H. Company is not affected
by this law. because we pay cash for
stamps and do not come within the,
scope of the law. We complied with
this law two years ago"
PROCEDURE IN CASE
It will be several weeks before the
decision of the court will be applied
in Washington. The procedure calls
for 30 days In which application for
a rehearing may be made. If at the
end of that time no application has
been filed or If one has been filed
and denied, an order will issue to the
court from which the appeal was
taken in line with the decision of the
supreme court.
