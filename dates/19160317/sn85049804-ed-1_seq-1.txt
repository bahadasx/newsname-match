OUR CITY PRIMARIES.
Last Monday was a red letter day
to the iitizens of Des Moines, espe
cially to most of the candidates. The
day was an ideal March day, although
the vote was rather light. Out of the
sixty candidates only twenty-four
were nominated and only half of this
number can be elected on Monday,
March 27th. Among those rixty-six
candidates running was a Negro, a
Jew, two Swedes, one Italian and sev
eral Catholics. One Catholic was
nominated, one Jew, two Swedes, but
the Negro and Italian were both de
feated. While Mr. Rush made a clean,
manly fight and we had hoped that he
might have secured enough votes to
have placed hirii oil tlie tidcct, yet «0
fell to about fifteenth place out of
twenty-one candidates. He only car
ried two precincts. We regret his de
feat, yet Atty. Rush and his race has
made many good friends, and one
good thing that was shown to the
white man was the fact that the Ne
groes can get together and all work
together for a member of our own
race. We were all united and all the
other candidates respected and even
feared us when thus united.
PRIMARY RESULTS.
Our recent primaries held Monday
resulted as a rule in the nomination
of good, capable men for the various
city offices. For mayor there are two.
Both are good citizens and eminently
qualified. For councilmen there are
eight nominated, four to be elected.
We are personally acquainted with
all the candidates and know that at
least seven of them we can vouch for,
as far as fair dealings with the col
ored people. The other ne, whose
name of John L. Hamery, was a mem
ber of the city council once before and
had charge of the public safety and
his unfair dealings with the colored
people in so far as related to the po
lice department certainly did great
harm to the colored people of this
city, and we urge our colored people
to vote against him. Those of us
who lived through that administration
know that it was the worst depart
ment in treatment of colored people
that we ever experienced in the his
tory of Des Moines. Having beenl
weighed in the balance and found
wanting, we would urge our colored
voters to vote and work against him at
this election.
HIGH SCHOOL IRLS CLUB.
On next Sunday afternoon the High
School Girl's club will meet wi'h Mrs.
S. foe Brown, 1058 5th street, at which
time Rev. Dr. Howard, who is con
ducting the revival at St. Paul's A M.
E. church will speak to the girls.
I hereby express my sincere
thanks to the colored voters who
voted for me at the primaries last
Monday, and solicit your vote at
the city election March 27th.

FAIRWEATHER FOR COUNCIL
MAN.
It is indeed a pleasure for us to
present to you again the cut of Thom
as Fairweather, who ran the highest
in the primaries last Monady, com
peting against twenty-eight others.
Mr. Fairweather is amply efficient for
this capacity and his many friends
believe so or they would not have
supported him as they did. He is one
of our Drake men, and has the esteem
of all classes and races in this city.
He appreciates your support, and
says he will show his appreciation to
all should he be elected March 27th at
the city election. His fair dealings
with the colored race, and his honesty
to all races, besides his other requis
ites, fully qualifies him for council
man.

BUDD FOR COUNCILMAN.
It is a great pleasure that we are
able to present to our readers the pic
ture of Mr. John Budd, who ran sec
ond at the primaries for councilman,
and his name will be on the ticket to
be voted upon March 27th at the city

better qualified candidate in the pres

was born and educated in this state,
worked as city engineer and is the
JAMES J. CONROY FOR COUN
CILMAN.
The result of the recent primary in
dicates very plainly that James J.
Conroy is without question one of the
strong factors in the coining election.
His force of character, clean person
ality and mental ability evidently ap
pealed to the citizens of our city.
Men of his type can and will do things
which •mil bring order out of chaos,
and which will place Des Moines up
on a clean, moral, as well a3 a sub
stantial business basis. Ills ability,
integrity and sincerity of purpose
have never been questioned, ifnd if the
citizens of Des Moines exercise their
usual good judgment in the selection
of the members of the next city coun
cil ,Mr. Conroy will undoubtedly be
one of the four i&en to be chosen.
liis sympathy and assistance along
labor union lines has been appreciat
ed, as has been expressed by their un
divided and unsolicited endorsement
of his candidacy.
It would seem that in the selection
of the next city council Mr. Conroy is
the logical man, because he an by his
business ability and his knowledge of
municipal affairs render such service
as will bring about the results the
people as a whole are expecting from
our public officials.
He would be glad to havo all sin
cere and progressive citizens call at
his headquarters, 907 Walnut street,
and discuss any matters pertaining to
municipal affairs, believing that it
would be of mutual benefit
JUDGE FRISK.
It. is gratifying that our friend, Ed
win J. Frisk, was nominated for judge
of the municipal court. He is amply
qualified, has the experience in -judi
cial matters and a clean record. An
upright and honest man, always a
true friend to our people. He will
make a good judge, and the Bystand
er endorses and recommends him to
vote and support of our race.
I hereby express my sincere
thanks to the colored voters who
voted for me at the primaries last
Monday, and solicit your vote at
the city election March 27th.

WALTER IRISH FOR MUNICIPAL
JUDGE.
Nearly everybody who has had any
thing to do with courts in Polk coun
ty during the last thirty years knows
Walter Irish. Through all that time
he has been one of thi-efficial feporfc
ers and has averaged nearly three
hundred days a year in court. It )3
easily seen that this is a much larger
experience than the ordinary practic
ing attorney is able to secure, white
at the same time Mr. Irish has the
advantage of the same disinterested
relationship' to these trials as the
judge. He has gone through each
case a second time in making a tran
script of the record and as a lawyer
has followed the history of appealed
cases and studied the opinions of the
supreme court.
Mr. Irish graduated from the law
department of Drake university and
was admitted to the bar in 1899, He
has appeared as counsel in many
cases with success.
Combining the qualifications of a
practicing attorney with those of a
shorthand reporter, serving under
Judges Given, Connor, Kavanaugh,
Holmes, Brennan asd Utterback,
Irish can certainly give valuable as
sistance in the organization of the
ne wmunicipal court and its future
conduct.
Vote for him March 27.
