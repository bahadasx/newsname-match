Many customers for iron beds overlook the fact that puality is .
a factor more to be considered than price. Where price only is the :
desire of the customer he fails to get that satisfaction from his pur
chase enjoyed by he who takes quality into consideration. Ours ,
is not the common iron beds, but STEEL BEDS, made of the best
quality of steel tubing (not common gas pipe) and finished in a way
entirely different from the ordinary iron bed.
Ws can't always show you ths lowest pries iron bed to bs had, but ws can show you ths (
best tins of Steel Beds on ths market If you ars a particular buyer ws would like to
explain to you ths diffsrencs between ours and ths ordinary kind of iron beds.
