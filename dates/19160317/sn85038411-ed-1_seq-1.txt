By Associated Press
£1 Paso, Texas, March 17.—Expec
tation- along the border was keyed to
its highest pitch to-day by the general
belief that before nightfall the ad
vance guard of the American expe
ditionary force would have entered j
A'illa territory ir> the mountains of the
Casas Grandes region of Mexico.
While the censorship prevented any !
official news of the whereabouts of the j
American columns, reports brought by i
Americans arriving from the interior,
coupled with the calculations of men
thoroughly familiar with the territory .
over which the expeditionary force is ;
passing, made it reasonably certain
that the I'nlted States soldiers must be
close to Ihe district where Villa is be
lieved to exercise his greatest influence
and have the larget number of sym
pathizers.
Making l ast Time
New definite facts about the Amer
ican expedition to-day stood out with
considerable clearness as the result of
official published reports and the news
brought here by Americans who have
been in touch with some portion of
the American movement.
It seemed certain that of the two
columns which are "somewhere in
S Mexico" one was constituted for
speed, while the other apparently was
moving more slowly. The swift
footed column was the auxiliary army,
seemingly mostly cavalry, which went
into Mexico fifty miles west of the
main army of General Pershing when
lii 3 forces crossed at Columbus, N. M.
Columns Will Meet
The secrecy which has surrounded
the movements of the main column
has been slight compared with the
record of this western force. There
is reason to believe, from the offi
cial announcements, that the western
column may have gone into Mexico
earlier than the main body. Every
report arriving here asserts that the
western wing has traveled the far
ther. By these same reports, the two
columns will form a junction near the
threatened American Mormon colo
nists, probably in the Casas Grandes
region.
Discus* Garrisoning
Carrania officials, it was learned to
day, have been discussing with some
concern whether American troops,
during the Villa pursuit, would have
to occupy any Mexican cities and the
effect of such occupation upon Mex
ican public sentiment.
The Carranza officers have frankly
expressed the hope that the garrison
ing of the cities can be left to their
own troops. The American army's
choice of the Chihuahua desert as its
place of entry precludes for the pres
ent such a problem as city garrison
duty.
It is estimated here that the cost
of the Villa pursuit at present is up
ward of $40,000 per day.
While the possibility that actual
lighting with the Villlstas might be
gin nt any moment,, interest was re
doubled in every item of intelligence
that threw any light on the attitude of
the Carranza adherents and more es
pecially on that of the Ave detach
ments of Carranza troops who are de
clared by the officials of the de facto
government to be operating against
Villa.
No Close Co-operation
Andres Garcia, the Carranza consul
here, who Is recognized as the closest
man to the first chief on the border,
refused to make any definite statement

DAPP IS STRONG
FOR LOCAL OPTION
"Xo Uncertainty as to Where
I Stand,'" He Says; Prom
inent as Fireman
Edward Dapp, candidate for the j
Legislature in the city district on the |
Republican ticket, came out to-day in j
a strong statement in favor of local
option. Mr. Dapp, who was elected j
Jury Commissioner as an independent j
Republican in 1913 by a majority that,
ran away ahead of his ticket, made j
the following announcement as to his 1
views on the local option question, ;
which will be one of the principal >
issues in the next Legislature:
"I have been asked by many of my
friends why I have chosen to be a can- i
didate for the State Assembly on a i'
local option platform. They and the
: voters whose support lam seeking are :
I entitled to a denite answer to this,
1 question. There is undoubtedly a very
strong sentiment in our community in
favor of local option as respects the,
sale of intoxicating liquors and it is for
i the purpose of getting an expression
j of the sentiment of my fellow-citizens |
j on this question that my own position ,:
i has been made so definite. I believe
in government by the people and that
the majority should rule the minority. ;'
I rather than the rule of the majority i
jby the minority. If elected, as I hope
to be, there will be no uncertainty as 1
| to what shall be my duty to my con
stituents. Their desire will have a
true expression in my vote, and I "am
willing to stand or fall according to
their will."
Mr. Dapp is well known in railroad I
I circles and as a volunteer fireman Is ;
j interested in getting the Legislature to
I adopt an amendment whereby all of
[ the 2 per cent, of the State tax on
| foreign (Ire insurance will go to the
relief of sick and injured firemen, in
! stead of 1 per cent., as at present. He j
Is also an advocate of the erection in
| Capitol Park of a monument to the
firemen of the State who died in the
protection of lives and property from (
fire.

STEELTON STORE
TO BE DIVORCED
FROM STEEL CO.?
General Manager Denies
Humor; Based on Schwab's
Attitude in Bethlehem
Persistent rumors that tlie Steel-'
ton Store Company, Limited, one of:
the largest wholesale and retail estab
lishments in Central Pennsylvania,,
would be scparafed from its present
close collection with the Pennsylvania
Steel Company, were declared to be
unfounded by W. E. Abercrombie,
general manager and one of the in
corporators, this morning. •
"X have no knowledge of any change :
being contemplated," declared Mr.
Abercrombie. "To my knowledge this;
talk of changes is merely gossip."!
General Manager Abercrombie also
denied the report which was current
this morning that the steel company
to-day discontinued to honor the
credit books of customers of the
I store.
Reports that the management of
ihe store company would be made in
dependent of the steel works were
: started, it is said, by the fact that
j Charles M. Schwab, chairman of the
j board of directors of the Bethlehem
Steel Corporation which recently ac
i quired the Pennsylvania Steel Com
, pany and its subsidiaries, was instru
j mental in placing all stores in South
I Bethlehem on a cash basis following
the big strike there several years ago.
While there have been many rumors
of similar action here, there has been
. no intimation of such a plan from any
official quarters.
The Steelton Store Company,
Limited, is the largest single business
established in Steelton and one of the
largest in this section. It operates
, both wholesale and retail departments
: and is one of the most niodernly
j equipped stores in this vicinity. The
latest and best methods of merchan
dising have been incorporated in its
