Numdalslaget In Canton.
Rier Rlerson feels quite sure that
he has at last secured this year's meet
ing of the Numdalslaget for our city
and the dates will probably be the
8th and 9th of June. The only help
be asked was a free meeting ball for
the society ana of course the auditor
ium will till this need. This meeting
will bring a large number of strang
ers to our city on that date and our
people will look forward to a good
time with old friends. We will pub
lish news of this event latter when
arrangements are made.
"This Is The Life."
"This Is The Life," Halton Po
well's latest and best song and dance
show, has succeeded in registering
one of the biggest laughing musical
hits of recent ySars and will appear at
the Lyric theatre on March 24.
The story of "This Is The Life" is
excruciatingly funny the song hits
are fresh and sparkling the melodies
easily played, sung.and whistled. The
dance tunes are lively and infectious
and the cast has been carefully se
lected for its singing and acting
ability and is above the standard
heretofore set by Halton Powell, a
producer who has produced nothing
but the best in this line of entertain
ment. The chorus is not only pretty
aud able to sing and dauoe, but can
wear gracefully the sensational gowns
which have startled every city where
the production has appeared. Special
attention has been given to the stage
settings which it Is said are very
pretty and tasteful.
Warning To Spring Hunters.
Geese were flying over the city Sat
urday and hunters were heard talking
about the spring shooting and right
here let us tell you to keep your pet
shotgun right in its case for federal
game wardens are scattering all over
the country and will prosecute every
one caught shooting geese or ducks
this spring. The question was brought
up in court last year and an early de
cision is expected but meantime the
government is spreading its game of
ficers all over this territory with or
ders to arrest anyone, farmers and all
who are out after the game. Of
course spring shooting is the best but
it kills off the game too fast and the
government is determined to' stop it
regardless of what state laws say.
The trains on the Yankton division
were run via Canton since last
week on account of the high waters
around Yankton and Clay counties.

Knights Win Against Baracas
The second game between the Jun
ior Knights of the Congregational
Church and the Baraca Cadets of the
Methodist Church was a revelation to
those who expected to see a "Kids",
game. The boys displayed, speed ac
curacy, and Basket ball "Sense" un
dreampt of by those who had not wit
nessed their workouts. The guarding
on both sides wild close, the passing
accurate, and the work of the for
wards at times sensational. The
team work, while not all that might
be desired, was remarkable consider
ing the limited experience of the
teams. Canton may well anticipate
having basketball $eanps in the neax
future that shall bring home houor to
their school and town. It would be
unfair to the boys to pitis stars for
the work of nearly every man in the
game was worthy of special, mention.
The Methodist boys started with a
rush and secured three field goals in
rapid succession before the Congrega
tional boys woke up. After that it
was a battle royal throughout, the
score at the end of the first half being
12-9 and the final score 23*14 In favor

The Squirrel Question May Be
Solved by Bird Houses.
The News last issue laid the blame
for the shortage of birds In our city
to the squirrels and many doubted the
Statement.
Judge Wm. B. Mai lory who is per
haps the b,est posted authority in the
county on bird life states that red
squirrels are very destructive to bird
eggs and many cities are replacing
them with the grey squirrels but even
then harm still results.
Editor .Danforth of the Vermillion
Republican says: "My home is .sur
rounded by a large number of trees
and I know that before the advent of
the squirrels in such large numbers
these trees were full of bird nests but
now they are devoid ofnests entirely.
This destruction of the nests and the
eating of the eggs and the young birds
has led toa well developed movement

erection of bird houses where the
birds may nest and rear their young
unmolested. While I am fond of the
squirrels myself, I have quit feeding
them since I discovered this fact."
Prof. H. C. Severin, state entomol
ogist at the Brookings agricultural
college refers to a prominent national
authority who says the red squirrel is
the most destructive but also says
that it is not so widely known that
squirrels eat insects as that they rob
birds' nest. Possibly their virtues
may balance their faults. He tells of
examining a tree that had been in
fested with leaf hoppers and caterpil
lars shortly after watching a squirrel
hunting and eating them and found
only about a dozen in half an hour.
Let us all put up at least one bird
house in our yards as soon as we
buy or make them and see if we can
not keep both the squirrels and the
birds. Make them with a platform
on a pole or have the boxes large and
holes small so the squirrels can not
get in or reach in.
Mr and Mrs. G. W. Eagle and
daughter, Miss Georgia, returned
from their winter's visit to California,
Tuesday.
Ooparta
After living there a short time Mr.
Pelley heard of the beautiful Sioux
Valley and its glorious lands which
Uncle Sam would give to all those
who wanted a home In the land of
the Dakotas and like many others
who wished for a home of their own
he took his family and with all of his
worldly possessions which were a team
of horses and a prairie schooner and
started across the prairie and sloughs
of western Iowa and traveled until
they came to the Big Sioux River at
Beloit which they forded and reached
the land of promise, then Dakota Ter
ritory.
He at last found a homestead in
section 34, Pleasant township, where
he like the rest of the early pioneers
had to build himself a sod house to
live in which was their home through
many years of hardships which all the
pioneers bad to endure. Thus it was
In 1873 he became a resident of Lin
coln county. Although they escaped
the terrible prairie tires which had
swept over the country in earlier
years they had to go through the
grasshopper scourges of 1874 to 1875
having most of his crops devoured and
nothing left for his -hard summers
work but barren tields, but he stuck
to his farm in spite of the grasshop
pers, the hall storms and drought and
all the rest of the heartbreaking
trials of the early times.
Like all the rest of the settlers here
before 1880, what farm produce he
did raise he had to haul either to Le
Mars or Sioux City in order to sell it.
These trips took from three to twelve
days at a time during which his fam
ily had to care for the stock at home
and if he was away worry about the
terrible blizzards that swept over the
prairies. Fuel was scarce and many
had to burn twisted hay in their
stoves and fireplaces.
In July, 1876, he with others made
a hurried move to the Sioux Valley
at the time of the great Indian Scare
when Gen. Custer and his troops were
massacred on the Little Big Horn in
Montana. All the settlers in the
western part ft the county came in
aud camped here for a week or more.
Mr. Pelley stuck to his farm for 28
years after which he moved to Sioux
Falls where he has lived the past 16
years enjoying the Irults of his bard
labor. On March 9th, 1916, the sum
mons came which we must all answer
some day, and at the age of 08 years,
11 months and 3 days, Mr. Pelley
passed over the Great Divide at the
home of his son, Fred Pelley at 723
South Fourth Avenue, in Sioux Falls.
Thus one by one our pioneers are
crossing the great and crystal river to
a country even better than our own
fair land that we all love so well.
After brief funeral services at the
son's home the remains were brought
to Canton to the home of his daugh
ter, Mrs. B. E. Wood, where on Mon
day services were conducted by Rev.
Preston. Then the friends followed
this christian brother to his final
resting place in the beautiful Forest
Hill cemetery which overlooks the

That is the title of the Fox feature
at the Lyric next Monday night. A
suave gentleman sows the seeds of
discontent in the mind of a credulous
country •'girl who is married to a hard,
working home loving farmer. This
polished rascal with his glib talk of
city life not only alienates the pretty
little woman from her husband but
also tries to lure Her away from him.
