To the 1'eopb of Monroe iJnuntv:
The law does ni reqnire " that I
submit a report tip the Board uf Su
pervisors, hut I jno desire- to - report
to tli people ifrho elected me to this
oilice, what-i have dune during, the
two months that I have nerved you,
:ind to call to yonr attention to farts
that should be' of interest to you as
tax payers of this county.' .
1 have appMired in 43 en. see, pros
ecuting for the state, the towns and
the villages, those persons who have
been charged with violations el the
laws of the State of Mississippi,' and
during these two months $1 185.00
has been turned into the treasury of
the county in fines.,- My salary ' for
these two months lias been $8o.'i3
per month, or $Ifi0.fi(,Vo you will
see that the net amount received
from these lines is $1017..'1. which
sum goes to reduce your taxes and
bear the expenses of other depart
ments. If you were conducting a
business that netted you $lf17JM
in two -months would you not .con
sider your business a profitable one?
This money has been-paid by those
who have violated the law;' arid in
every instance they must have been
guilty, for none of those convicted
have appealed their cases to the Cir
cuit Court.
I have not lost a case that I have
prosecuted, but have in several in
stances asked that cases be dismiss
ed where I saw the evidence was
not suilicient to sustain a conviction,
for in no instance do 1 desire to con
vict an innocent man or one against
whom the State can ivt produce
sullicient proof of guilt. In doing
this I have saved the county the ex
pense attached to the trial of these
eases in the Circuit Court.
My records show that T have ap-
pea.red in 2 forgery eases, 1 habeas,
corpus case, ' illicit retailing cases,
. trespass cases, ( petit larceny
igf? .tur'J,r ci'se, i -iiht-H. jaltcre ,
the defendants were charged with
carrying concealed weapons. .VpiuV
lic drunkeness and public profanity
cases, 1 case f embezzlement, i"2
grand larceny cases, 1 case '-of dis
turbing public worship, "i gambling
cases, 8 assault and battery cases, 1
burglary case.
Most of these defendants have been
represented by attorneys, and no
doubt the majority of them would
have been cleared had tin4 state -not
''"'rn represented at these trials', by
tne Vounty Prosecuting .Attorney.

A nation is made great, not by its
fruitful acres, but by the men who
cultivate them; not by its greal
forests, but by tlie men who use
them; not by its mines, " but by the
men w ho workin them; not by its
railways, but by t he-men who build
and when Columbus discovered it;
Americans have made of it a'great
Nation. . v
In 1776 our fathers had a vision of
anew Nation, "conceived in liberty
md dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.'
Without an army they fought the
greatest of existing world empires
that they might realize this vision.
A third of a century later, without
a navy they fought the greatest navy
in the world that they might win
for their Nation the freedom of the
seas. Half a century later, they
fought through an unparalleled Civil
War that they might establish for
all time on tnis continent the in
alienable right of life, liberty, and
the pursuit of . happiness. A third
of a century later they fought to
emancipate an oppressed neighlor,
and. victory . won, gave back Cuba
to the Cubans, sent an army of
schoolmasters to educate for liberty
the Filipinos, asked no war in
demnity from their : - vanquished
enemy, but paid him liberally for
his property. Meanwhile they offer
ed land freely to any farmer
who would live upon and cultivate !
it, opened to foreign immigrants on
equal terms the door of industrial
opportunity, shared with them
political equality, and provided by
universal taxation for universal
education..,
'The -cynic wiio can see in this

ever his parentage, whatever his
birthplace. . 1 1 e who looks with
pride rinon this history which his
fathers have written ' by their heroic
deeds, who v accepts with gratitude
the inheritance whichthev have be
queathed to him, and" who highly
resolves to preserve this inheritance
unimpaired and to pass it on to his
descendants enlarged and enriched,
is a true American, be his birthplace
or his parentage what it jnay. ; .

Alter each lesislatfre Vion the
courts are kept buny until the next
session convenes undoing the mis
chief perpetrated by incompetent
legislators.
Several statutes have already been
passed by the Mississippi Legislature
that excite both amusement and do
tision among able lawyers who
know full well that these . measures
will be declared unconstitutional
when tliey reach the courts.
Worse still, it not only costs
money to make these useless laws,
but it costs money to wipe them off
the statute books , after they have
been written, to say nothing of the
turmoil, the uncertainty and the
dissatisfaction they produce.
It is easy enough to find the
cause of this, and equally to point
the remedy, but the trouble is that
the people will not take the remedy
even when they realize its merit.
In many of our counties . the
voters, it seems, send men to the
Legislature chiefly for the purpose
of getting rid of them at home for a
few months. They elect men , to
come to Jackson and transact public
business, involving many millions
of dollars and untold property in
terests, tc say nothing of human
liberity. whom they would not dare
trust with the transaction of their
private business.
For instance, suppose you had a
piece of business requiring the ser
vices of a first-class lawyer? How
manv men are there in the Missis
sippi Legislature in whose hands you
would be willing to place that busi
ness? Well, not very many.
Until the people are awakened to
the fact that the making of laws is
an important function of the tate
government, we will have a con
tinuation of congested court dockets
and the judiciary will be kept busy
setting aside foolish legislation.
