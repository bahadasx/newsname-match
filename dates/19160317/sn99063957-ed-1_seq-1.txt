TRY TO PROVE HUB
Woman Swears She Was In
Slaughter's Home Until Mid
night Girl Not There
Oroville, Gal., March 17. What the
defense regarded as highly important
testimony was given today by Mrs.
Ivey Camper in the trial of l!ev.
Madison Slaughter on a charge of at
tacking Gertrude Iainson, aged 15.
Mrs. Camper declared she was in the
Slaughter home until after midnight on
November l.'l, the date of one of the al
leged offenses. She said the girl was
not seen. Furthermore, Mrs. Camper
asserted, Gertrude was not in the spare
room in the morning.
The girl had previously testified that
she was attacked while in the spare
room that night.
Tho session of court today was
marked by wrangling among lawyer.
Judge Gregory dismissed the jury while
he qdmonished. them to be less quarrel
some. An attempt to show that Mrs. Camper
was biased in favor of Slaughter on
account of being an intimate friend of
his familv was made bv the prosecu
tion. llev. K. M. Smith. Methodisfcaminister
of Chico, was present to give Slaughter
his moral support. Out of court Smith
declared he believed the newspapers
were trying to "railroad" Slaughter
to- the penitentiary.
William King and George Murphy,
sons of wealthy cattlemen, and admit
ted admirers of two of Slaughter's
daughters, swore that they were at the
Slaughter house on the evening of
November 13 during the period in which
Gertrude asserted an offense was com
mitted They declared she did not call
at the house while they were there, and
furthermore testified that they left
their hats and coats in the spare room
where the attack was alleged to have
been made. When they went to get
their things they found them undis
turbed. More Than 50 Per Cent of
Property Owners Sign
the Petitions
After half a century of agitation and
watchful and patient waiting, the im
provement of the fair grounds road is
practically assured. This was decided
at the meeting held last evening when
the property owners along the road and
city officials met to discuss the matter.
As fully SO per cent of the property
owiiers were present and others favor
able to the iniprivement hail so express
ed themselves, the petition already
signed includes enough names to make
the improvement a sure thing, and un
less soothing unforseen happens, work
will begin as soon as legal publication
is made, liesides the fair grounds road,
the Portland road, from the grounds to
the city limits north, about l.Ooo feet
will also be paved before the next state
lair.
As the matter now stands, the own-1
ers of property on the fairgrounds road
feel thev can stand n price of liu cents
a square yard, or about $1.30 cents a I
lineal foot. The city offers to do the!
grading anil excavating and the state
has also promised material aid. After
the amount of help from the state is
determined, ndditiiijnal donation will
be required from the citizens of the
city. I
The next step is to advertise the pe
tition for the improvement. After this
is done, it is up to the city council and
the civic department of the commercial
dub to make arrangements for addi
tional funds. No nssesseat will have1
to be paid this year, and the amount!
assessed against property may be paid
i 10 per cent yearly installments.
About ijO property owners were pres
ent at the meeting. Mayor Ilarley O. '
White and the sheet committee, W. H. '
Cook and .. A. Mills, spoke briefly in
favor of the improvement. With the'
exception of one man who was against!
improvements of any kind, the property!
owners of the fair grounds road were in
favor of doing the work tins spring.;
provided they were assured the cost to
them would not exceed liO cents a'
square yard. With this assurance, ev-j
erything at last looks like something
will be doing. I

Douglas, Ariz., Mar. 17 The 700,0(l(
rounds of ammunition for the de facto
troops at Cabullona, held up pending
a decision from Washington, were being
transported across the border into Agua

Reports that the Carranza troops at
Cabullona were threatening mutiny
were branded as preposterous by Car
ranza Consul Ives Lavcllicr.
"There is no truth in the report,"
declared I.uvellier. "Governor Calles'
most trusted troops are at Cabullona."
Despite this assurance some uneasi
ness is felt here over the fact that this
large amount of ammunition hns got
into tlirrhands of the Carranzistas.
The border here Is still being closely
patrolled by United States cavalry.
Rumors of a revolt of Carranza troops
south of Agua Prioia, presumably at
Cabullona, reached Douglas today. No
confirmation was obtainable.
Ranchers arriving here reported see
ing American troops encamped north of
Asceucion, Chihuahua. It is bcliced
a junction between the Columbus col
umn and Colonel Dona's divisic-i from
Culberson's ranch may take place there.
If this report is true, the Columbus
column has penetrated 55 miles into
Mexico.
Should Villa escape to the Sonora
side of the Sierra Madres an American
expedition against him, stc.rtirg fro'o
Douglas, was considered a possibility.
The forces at Camp Douglas could move

"It took 11 years to eliminate Jess

"Villa is in a country vastly bettei

from the worst swelled head in history,

SEAHLE SOCIETY IS
AFRAIDOF PUBLICITY
Sheriff Threatens to Turn
Names and Pictures Over
to Newspapers
Seattle, Wash., Mar. 17. Sheriff
Hodge announced positively today that
he would wait uutil night for" word
from Los Angeles that Deputy M. K.
llalley had left there with Mrs. Isabel
Clayburg, alleged Seattle "badger"
queen, if no word conies, he says he
will open up on the wealthy alleged vic
tims in Seattle, who were reported to
be backing her fight against extradi
tion, and "give them all the publicity
they want and then some."
"They are hampering the ends of
justice," Hodge declared. "They must
be dealt with summarily."
Mrs. Clayburg was refused a writ of
iiabeas corpus in the superior court at
Los Angeles Thursday and given 21
hours in which to prepare for a trip to
Seattle for trial on a charge of j'on
spiracy to blackmail a wealthy mining
promoter and clubman, and other per
sons here.
Defense Attorney 'Darl lingers gave
notice of an appeal to the circuit court,
which action would delay the case here
for several weeks.
"One of victims has gone from here
to Los Angeles and is financing this le
gal fight," said Hodge.
"I announce right now that if this
man don't let the law take its course
I will turn over every bit of evidence I
have, including the names of every vic
tim the gang photographed during the
two years of their operations, together
with the pictures, to the newspapers.
"At the same time, using photo
graphs as evidence, 1 can charge a
number of our best citizens, so-called,
with crimes, the minimum penalty for
which is two years in the peniten
tiary." While Mrs. Ckivburg's fate is still
uncertain, Miss Lillian Peterson and
Miss Dottie Coots, the other alleged
"badger girls" brought here for trial,
from San Francisco, are languishing in
the county jail.
JUarket Rather Dull
Prices Are Unchanged
New York, March 17. The New
York Sun's financial review today
said:
There was a marked contraction in
the volume of business compared to
the sessions immediately preceding.
Prices were irregular, and confined
within a narrow range. Professionals
described the maikct as awaiting defi
nite news of Mexi-nn developments and
the Verdun fighting, but nn explana
tion comporting licf.er with recent Wall
Street performances was that relative
dullness and hesitation were the natural
result of recent heavy realizing sales.
With the short interest reduced and
little public buying, the general list
nevertheless acted well.
The market opened uncertainly, re
sulting in a sharp break in Crucible
Steel upon failure of its directors to act
toward liquidation of' the dividends ac
cumulated by preferred stock, which
now amount to li.j per cent Steel was
active and higher upon the wonderful
showing in its annual report. Mercan
tile preferred, Baldwin Locomotive and
American Beet Sugar were strong
features.

the police arrested Claire Bartholomew
of Fossil, but later released him. The
Salem police were informed that Bar
tholomew would leave Cnburg yester
day for this city and that he was the

rested as he stepped from the train. He
was immediatcl v taken to the rooming
house where Linnd and Bartholomew
stopped in Salem before the murder
wiiere it was found out that Claire Bar
tholomew was not the m in who was

Armv headquarters were still appre

Mexican peons who, ignorant of the ex

"gringo" invasion of Mexico and
fight accordingly.
"I note certain dispatches state no

Funston today.
"On the contrary, about 100 are with

Congress Drops Everything
to Perfect Plans for
Larger Army
By Bond P. Ooddes
(1'nited Press Staff Correspondent.)
Washington, March 17. Congross,
dropping all other considerations, to
day began actual work on army reor
ganization. .Senator Chamberlain re
ported his army increase bill from com
mittee, and announced he was ready
to call it up for consideration Mon
day. Chairman Hay of the house military
committee opened with a speech bear
ing ou the proposition of making the
regular army 1 10,000 strong.
"On a question of this character,"
he declared, "all Americans should
stand together."
Tremendous applause greeted this.
Hay called the bill a "reasonable meas
ure" and said:
"It will meet opposition from those
who are opposed to any defensive legis
lation, and from those who think it
does not go far enough Wo hnvo a
volunteer system in this country, and
must deal with conditions as they arc,
not as elsewhere, in countries where
there is compulsory military service.
An army of L'0l),lHMl men would meati
compulsory service. 1 don't think the
country would iuce.pt such a proposi
tion." Great applause at this point demon
strated that there was a strong anti
conscription .-culiinrnt. Continuing,
I lav said:
"An army of L'"0.000 men would
cost tho nation $7.10,000,000 annually.
I don't believe congress is ready to fid
dle such an expense ns that on This
country iu times of peace."
llepresentative advocated an army of
at least IIOO.OOO men.
It was indicated that the making of
both these requests would be postponed
until the extent, of the campaign
against Villa and the length of time
; probably required to hunt him duwn
I could be accurately forecasted.
' Lenders admitted tiint the final army
I si heme would be drafted nt uilministra
j tion conferences immediately following
passage of the Hay and ( hamberlain
hills. Setting aside all other business,
the house today took up the Hay pro
Ipnreilness measure. While some hoped
to pass it tomorrow, leaders belies ed
the debate would force the time of
' voting over into next week.
! Senator Chamberlain was expected to
ask that the Myers water power bill be
sidetracked for consideration of his
1 armv law.
An increased demand for prepared
ness on account of the .Mexican situ
ation was indicated, and it was be-
! lieved the niitnoried army strength
would probably be raised over the 111,-
I 000 men nyproved by the house.

Fd Paso, Texas, Mnr. 17. If Carran

Francisco Villa, the United htate
forces must follow him to his favorite
haunts in mountainous western Chihua
