golden Celtic harp on a green ground
.Which is flown generally by Irishmen,
wroto tho Itov. P. YorUo in tho San
Francisco Leader. But as flags go it
is comparatively new.
It first made Its appenronco in 1708,
when it was adopted by tho United
Irishmen, and It Is said that they
choso green because it la a blend of
orango and blue, to, typify tho union
of north and south.
In point of antiquity tho real Irish
Dag la the "spear and serpent," which
appears in the arms of tho O'Sulll
Tans. It is said to commemorato the
Incident of Goadhal Glas, tbo ancestor
of Milcslus, who. tradition says, was

Moses. Next to that comes the flag of

weight of opinion seems to favor this

deed, was olways Ireland's national
color until 1708.
Ono of tho most popular Irish flags la
tho thrco golden crowns on n bluo

of tho nrovlnco of Muuster. This was
accepted after tho Norman Invasion of
H70 ns tho Uag of Ireland, tho threo
crowns tvolfylnif tho kingdoms of Des
mond. Ormond and Thomond, It was
retained until 1547, when Henry VIII.
abolished it and substituted tho harp.
Coming down to moro recent times,
