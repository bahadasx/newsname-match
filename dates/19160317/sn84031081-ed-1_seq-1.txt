Washington, March 16. An impen
etrable wall of secrecy surrounded to
night the movements of American
troops beyond the Mexican border. So
far as official Washington was ad
vised, the columns might virtually
liiive vanished into thin air when they
crossed the international boundary
yesterday in pursuit of Villa. Even
the commander-in-chief. President
Wilson, did not know where General
Pershing's men were.
Secretary I iilnfoimi'd.
S"oretary Baker received virtually
dealing: with event beyond the bor-j
der. Late today he said he did not
know whether the troops had pro
ceeded southward frrtm their first
bivouac on Mexican soil last night.
Not a single dispatch from the border
was made public during the day ox

tenant Kell, Eleventh cavalry, at the j
Columbus hospital, where he took his'
own life in a fit of despondency.
Villa Far South of I'lti'stiers.
Army officials were convinced that
no impottant developments were to be
expected for several days. It seemed
plain from tho day's accumulation of
rumors that Villa was far to the south 1
of his American pursuers. I
The war department would not di-j
vulge any details of the number of
troops across the border or of the reg
iments sent. Press advices, however,'
showed that infantry accompanied the
cavalry and artillery out of Columbus
in the main column. That means slow
progress across the desert. It will

Villa was reported unofficially to have
been seen.
I'nrest at Tamplco.
American consuls in Mexico so far
have been able to give little aid to the
troops, although all are on watch for
Information that might indicate the
bandits' movements. Consular advices
today continued to report generally
ipiiet conditions. Officials displayed
some concern over the situation in the
Tampieo district, however, where there
are signs of unrest. The battleship
Kentucky was ordered back to Vera
Cruz from New Orleans, Secretary
Daniels explaining that nnval vessels
now on the Mexican coast did not have
radio equipment powerful enough to
insure uninterrupted communication
with Washington. With the Kentucky
at Vera Cruz, reports from smaller
vessels along the coast can be relayed
Mulckly to Key West and Arlington.
One Consul Ijcavin?.
The tdate department denied that
other American consuls than Consul
Williams, at Torreon, were leaving
their posts. Williams, they said, mere

sanitarium about 9:30 o'clock tonight.
By a strange cojincideiKe, he was

was his friend for many years, was
onlv twenty-seven days older.

Dr. W. Thornton, and his mother
Caroline V. Taylor. Governor Thorn
ton received his education in private
schools near Sedalla. Missouri, and
afterwards graduated from the law
department of the University of Ken

about the same time that Major Palen
enlisted in the union army, Governor
Thornton enlisted as a private In the
confederate army, serving with the
army of General Sterling Price for
two years. He was captured by union
forces during the retreat of the con
federates from Springfield, Missouri,

huge effectives after a heavy hom-
narnment against rreen positions at
I.e Morte Homme northwest of Ver
dun. The Germans who attacked in
serried masses were driven eastward
toward the Itoisles Corbeaux where
the French guns inflicted heavy cas
ualties on them.
The attack at Le Morte

repulsed in vicious hand to hand
fighting.
Roth Austrians anil Italians lay
claim to successes around San Mar
tino. The Austrians assert that an
Italian attack In this sector tailed
and that the Italians left numerous
dead on tiie Held. The Italian offic
ial statement declares that after
severe artillery and musketry prepar
ation the Austrians launched two
strong attacks and succeeded In
reaching the edge of the trenches
taken from them recently, but were
on each occasion repulsed, "leaving
the ground covered with dead."
Sinking of Tiibanllii.

Somewhere south of New Mexico, per-

the divided forces he is commanding.

The campaign is being conducted on

Giivirit's Attitude.
The statement of General Gnvira,
commandant at Juarez, that, while he
had given orders for co-operation in
accordance Willi instructions from his
government, he personally did not en
dorse such action, was the basis for
comment by army men. By some of
them, Gavira s attitude was taken asi
Indicntative of that of many Carranza
officers, but those high in authority
expressed the hope that discipline
would prevail in all cases over per
sonal opinion as it had in the case of

Jolni Action Not Nrt-Oisary.

tive force has not ybeen Ignored
Should such an Incident occur, army
men here say. it could scarcely be due
to mistaken identity, since the uni
form, erpiipment and general appear
ance of the Americans is sufficiently
unusual in .Mexico as to make con
fusion impossible.
General Funston'a attitude towards
General Pershing In very similar to
thnt adopted towards him by the war
department. To a great extent the
details of the expedition have been left
to General Pershing und his com

ering him or expecting from him re-
ports other than .those regarded by
General Pershing as essential.
Secrecy I Maintained.
Secrecy has yet been maintained as
to the exact disposition of the puni
tive force, its composition and future
movements. In general, it is admitted
the juncture of columns now heading
south will be made before the end of
the week, perhaps Saturday, when
they will be some fifty mlltja south of

The censorship at the bonier Is be

General Funston and his staff were
busy today carrying out the details of
the plan for strengthening the border
patrols and of having ready men and
supplies should they be required In
Mexico. More troops arrived at Co

New Mexico border, where they will
