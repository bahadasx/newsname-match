Soldiers that they are
Cordially Welcome
(By Associated Press.)
EL, PASO, Tex., Mar. 17. Rapidly growing uneasiness among
Americans In Mexico, especially in the north and west, Is evidenced
by the reports that United States citizens are either on their way
to the holder or are preparing to depart. At many -points along the
frontier Americans have arrived, but the -majority are said to be
leaving Mexico merely as a matter of precaution.
The most significant report received irom Durango is where the
American vice-consul advised thiit his wife and children be sent out
of the country. . American consul Williams and a large number of
Americans have arrived from Toi reon. The arrivals brought disquiet
ing stories as to the attitude ot Mexicans, especially In Chihuahua,

Publicity Expert Forecasts 10,

"The poor man's problem has be
come the rich man's game In Nevada,"
is the way John C. Martin, publlcitv
man for the Southern Pacific Land
Department, sums up the farm Bitua
tin in this state, for the Bonanza.
"The possibilities of farm develop
ment surpasses the richest dreams of
avarice," continued Mr. Martin, "but
It should not be thought that any man
can venture Into the arid sections of
this state and immediately lay the
foundation for a bank account. If
he knows nothing about dry farming
or irrigation by pumping then he bet
ter remain at home, whereever he Is,
for he is bound to make a failure.
This has been demonstrated repeated
ly in Humboldt and Elko counties, but
scientific soil culture 1b beginning to
be better understood and the class of
settlers taking up lands is different
from what it was several yearB ago
when men and women were obessed
by the idea that all they had to do
was to sow the seed and harvest a
crop a few months later. Neverthe
less, strange as it may appear, this is
the system practised successfully on
the bench lands of the Promontory
country where shipments of wheat last
year ran into the hundreds of car
loads. Two years before the section
was a wilderness of barrens of ths
most forbidding character. Then a.
few farmers from Cache county, Utah,
thought they would take a chance.
They plowed and sowed and then re
turned to their home ranches. When
they got through with their own crops
the following fall they took a Jaunt
over1 into the Promontory country
where they were greeted by fields
of yellow tasseled wheat just begging
the reaper to come along. This was
the beginning and for the last three
years the Promontory district that has
been rendered famous for the develop
ment of zinc, Is one of the most reli
able shippers tributary to the South
ern Pacific.
"But, to return to the original sub
ject," continued the speaker, "the dry
farm proposition Is attracting men ol
capital, men of means and experience
who are accompanied by soil experts,
water chemists, hydraulic engineer
and civil engineers who are engag-

WILL CONDUCT STORY HOUR
This' morning at the request ot
Geologist Robins and Tom Lynch,
Superintendent Chandler and Engin
eer Sherwin took them for a look at
the showing on the 50 level of the
Rescue-Eula.
One of the gentlemen, on coming
down town alter the visit, expressed
himself as astonished with the devel
opment. Ore of a shipping cbarao
ter is exposed for a distance ot sixty
five feet with a uniform width of at
least four feet. The ledge for a
ledge it is, is the finest trachite this
camp can show, has the normal dip to
the north and the regular strike east
and west, which is characteristic of
the ledges in Tonopah.
The raise at a point about the cen
ter of the drift on the orebody is up
probably twenty feet and the roof
shows the same width of excellent
ore that on a guess will average a
hundred dollars a ton as it stands
now. The face going east has the
body well defined with a very line
hanging wall on which the ore abuts
with that division which seems to be
Indicative of a body which will last
tor a long time, for the earmarks of
a mine are apparent everywhere.
The ledge is well within the boun
dary lines of the Eula claim and the
apex will be probably near the center
line of the claim so notning can
bother on that score. It would seem
the ledge was placed there as ideally
as one could possibly wish it to be.
'The lame block of trachite in
which this strike has been made will
without doubt, extend lower Into the
earth, but as it is. the extent to-1
ward the surface Is known and with
the projection of the ledge on Its
dip the backs will extend undoubtedly
eighty or one hundred feet upward,
so one can arrive at a fair estimate
of the amount of ore that Is being put
in sight daily In the mine.
The cross-cut on the eleven hund
red, which is being driven for the ore
body, should when It lands, place the
Rescne-Eula In the class of the bon
anzas of the camp.
