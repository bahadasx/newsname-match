FOR PURE STOCK
i
Organization Effected Here to
Rid Tazewell County of Scrub
Cattle?Sires Will Be Pur?
chased At Once.
A live stock meeting was held in
the Court House Saturday afternoon,
at which a pure-bred Shorthorn As?
sociation was organized. Officers were
elected and a set of by-laws and a
constitution were adopted.
The officers elected were:
James Ed. Pecry, President; O. B.
Barns, Vice-President; J. G. Barns,
Treasurer; J. L. Montague, Secretary;
and S. J. Thompson and U. S. Moss
Buying Committee.
Tho purposes of this organization
aro:
1. To bring about improvement in
live stock conditions by placing and
maintaining pure bred Shorthorn
bulls in the county.
2. To promote the breeding of pure?
bred Short-horn cattle in the county,
and to maintain a closer organization
and effective co-operation among tho
cattle men of Tazewell county.
The Association will also purchase
and sell pure-bred cuttle on the co-op?
erative plan. The work will begin by
the immediate purchase of ten or
twelve Pure-bred Shorthorn bulls,
which are to bo used for improving
the native stock. A few pure-breds
heifers will also be bought. It is the
aim of the association to place every
pure-bred bull raised in the county
with some of our farmers, and not let
them be shipped to outside points.
Any one owning a herd of short?
horns, or a bull or heifer, may become
a member of the association by pay?
ing the annual fee of b;>c a.ld submit?
ting a record of his animals to the
secretary.
Most of the bulls which are to be
bought this spring will be bought on
the community plan; that is, several
farmers in a community go in togeth?
er to buy a bull. The keeper of the
bull is allowed the breeding of his
own cows free, and all the service fees
which are to be paid in advance. The
stockholders in the bull will bo allow?
ed to breed one cow for $1.00 for each
$10.00 invested in the bull. Non
members will be charged S2.00. When I
tho nnimals are sold, each stockhold?
er receives his proportionate share of
the proceeds derived from the sale.
The exchange of community bulls
will be practiced.
The earnest co-operation of each
members of the association is desired.
Non-members are also asked to adopt
the slogan, "Get Rid of the Scrub
Sire,?Make Tazewell a Pure-Bred
County." The best efforts of every
citizen of Tazewell county must be
directed towards this movement of
improving the cattle if we ever ex?
pect to get anywhere. Cant you and
your neighbors buy a pure-bred bull
this spring to use in your communi?
ty? His offspring will bring you n
bigger profit with which to help pay
the good road tax.

i convention here Tuesday to name
lelegates to tho Congressional con?

leffersonvillo district mass meeting.
"Granny" Harris," editor of tho
Richlands Enterprise, refusal to par?
ticipate in tho Maiden Spring meet
ng. Those two gentlemen, who wor?
ship Roscvclt, wero doubtless afraid
that their idol might not receive a
square deal, and they wanted to be
free to hnvo a litlu convention of
their own, in case such was necessary
ind politic.
_ The greatest surprise to the old
timers was the unqualified endorse
nent of Alvah Martin of Norfolk,
"or delegate to the Republican con?
tention in Chicago. Herctoforo Mr.
Martin has failed to receive a' "look
in" in Tazewell.
