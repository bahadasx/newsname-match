THIRTIETH YEAR
ABERDEEN
TO RETAIN
SPAR YARD
Prompt Work by Chamber of Commerce Results
In Decision of Chris Endresen to Keep
Present Location.
CITY GIVES LONG LEASE FOR DOCK SITE
;Spar Builder Will Enlarge Plant, Put in New
Machinery and Add to Product Known
All Over the World
The Chris Endresen spar yards will
remain in Aberdeen, and, under the
plans of Mr. Endresen in which the
Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce has
actively co-operated, they are to be j
greatly enlarged. With the starting of :
the Anderson shipyards and helping i
to reopen the Lindstrom shipyards,
this keeping of the Endresen spar
yards in Aberdeen constitutes one of
the most material achievements in
the history of the local commercial
organization.
Until President A. C. Galllac of the
Chamber, who had arisen from a sick
bed to come to the city council meet
ing, explained to the council the
work done by the Chamber, few were
aware of the fact that the Endresen
yards were about to move to Hoquiam
a few weeks ago.
Mr. Endresen needed more room.
He was promised as much as he de
sired in Hoquiam. Our sister city,
with entirely proper desire to secure
-a live and growing industry, offered
Mr. Endresen a site for his yards.

GROCETERIA IS
PLANNED FOR
OLYMPIA NOW
The groceteria, the cafeteria sys
tem applied to grocery merchandising,
has arrived in Olympia. A Tacoma
concern will open one in the state
capital April 8. While customers will
be supposed to do their marketing
with basket on arm, taking their gro
ceries home with them, a delivery sys
tem also will be maintained, those
who avail themselves of it losing a
cash discount otherwise given on
goods.
DURING THE LAST FEW WEEKS OUR PAID-UP IN ADVANCE SUBSCRIPTIONS HAVE BEEN COMING IN AT A REMARKABLE PACE, AS HIGH AS
TEN TO 12 IN A DAY. WE ARE CERTAIN THAT ALL THE NEWSPAPERS ON THE HARBOR TOGETHER CANNOT SHOW SUCH A RECORD.
WHY IS THIS? SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE REALIZING THE VALUE OF THE HERALD. IT STANDS FOR SOMETHING DEFINITE, IS POSI
TIVELY INDEPENDENT, ANSWERS TO NOBODY'SBECK AND CALL, SAYS WHAT IT THINKS, AND IS A LIVE NEWSPAPER; KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE
HERALD. '

free. The president and committees
of the Aberdeen Chamber of Com
merce, with equally natural determin
ation to keep the industry here, quiet
! ly busied themselves in arguments to
I the spar builder who has made a trade
I and name for himself in all parts of
the earth, to show him the wisdom
of remaining in Aberdeen.
The city council, at Wednesday
night's meeting, showed quick appre
ciation of the situation. With little
discussion, the council acceded to Mr.
i Gaillac's request that the Endresen
: yards be given a 15-year lease of the
foot of Clark street, at a nominal
i rental, probably, of $1 a year. There
! Mr. Endresen will make his dock, the
i city retaining right of use if needed,
i His location, on the three great rail*
| ways, is ideal for marketing his pro
,' duct —a product that has brought de
■ sirable publicity to Aberdeen and
. Grays Harbor and that will bring
* more. To comply with the law, the
I council decided to advertise the rent
. al of the land for two weeks.
JUST A SOCIAL WIRELESS
Declaration of war upon Mex
ico, requiring instant use of all
U. S. ships, was one of the ru
mors started on the Harbor
last Sunday, by a hufry call
sent down here from Seattle
for information of the where
abouts of the coast guard ship
Manning, The query had been
sent to harbors between Puget
Sound and Portland. The
Manning finally was located on
Grays Harbor near Westport,
by the wireless of Ernest Mc-
Gee of Hoquiam, and the anxi
ety of the sender of the mes
sage was relieved. The wife
of an officer on the Manning
had arranged a Sunday dinner
party to several friends in Seat
tle, and the telegrams were
sent up and down the Coast on
the failure of the officer to
show on Elliott Bay in time
to perfect table arrangemenst.

In Raid by Police
Mayor McKee Denies Report Sunday
Closing Law Is to Be Invoked
Against Theaters
Hoquiam's tenderloin was cleaned
out the other night by the police and
orders given that all forms of gam
bling be stopped, punch boards and
dice games included. Report that
Sunday closing laws were. to be in
voked against cigar stands, candy
stores and theaters is indignantly de
nied by Mayor McKee.
CALL FOR BIDS
ON 3 BRIDGES
Bids on three bridges were called
this week by the county commission
ers, to be opened April 17. They are:
one over the Satsop river on the
Olympic highway; one for the Wish
kah road in section 36-19-9; and one
for the Wvnooche road at corners
of sections 32 and 33-19-8 and sections
4 and 5-18-8.
The local lodge of Knights of Pythias
(his week reorganized its Uniform
Rank, starting weekly drills last
night.
A TRULY REMARKABLE INCREASE
REORGANIZE RANK.
For "preparedness" in any way commensurate with the vast amount of money
which will be used seems humanly impossible when the unsurmountable obstacle of
"Pork and Politics" is taken into consideration. After millions upon millions have
been spent on our army and navy the results are a pitiful-joke. Even so, "what are
you going to do about it." The "big business" sharks have the nation where "the wool
is short."
"ALL I GOT TO SAY TO YOU IS IF YOU WANT TO START A ROUGHHOUSE GO AHEAD
AND START IT."
What with the European war, Mexico, "preparedness," threatened enormous
strikes, the liquor question, a national election warming up, and Tedda da Rosa, surely
your Uncle Sam has about enough on his hands.
HAVE NEW VAULTS
The vault space in the Hayes &
Hayes bank is being extended this
week, under plans drawn for the
work which provide for two additional
vaults taking up floor space 24 by
16 feet. They are of reinforced con
crete construction with steel rods and
steel mesh.

KELSEY TO
PUSH WORK
ON SUR VEY
City Engineer Will Rush Securing of Data From
Which Council May Decide on Dam of
Timber or of Concrete.
THREE CREWS OF MEN ARE NOW IN FIELD
Wishkah River Property Owners Want Council to*
Improve Road Along Route Dedicated
in 1914 by Mrs. Stewart
Full data is to be furnished by City
Engineer L. D. Kelsey, as soon as
possible, to the city council so that
it may decide whether the dam for
the Wishkah water project shall be of
timber, as orginally decided, or of
concrete, as favored by Consulting
Engineer F. L. Stannard of Portland.
The city engineer made a report,
at Wednesday night's council session,
on the work of surveying the pipe line
now under way. Three field parties
were put to work Monday, and on
Wednesday each was increased to
eight men and cook. One party is
working from the intake to Big creek;
one from Big creek to the Wishkah
forks; and the third, members of
which are living in the city, from the
reservoir north.
The work is being done under diffi
culties, stated Mr. Kelsey, from the
intake to Big creek, in transporting
equipment and supplies. This is due
to the fact that, when the Hulet dam
went out, the released water swept out
the wagon bridge over Big creek, mak
ing it necessary to follow the river
