given to the fathers, who are sharers
In the responsibility as well as in the
joy of the child's development.

which were to follow.

models and other helps, gave a clear,
helpful and instructive talk on the

most sympathetically spoke on the
"Training of the Child in the Home."

paper on "Mental Training of the
Child."

lighted the andlence with reading and

Jes.a little share of singin'
When the buds begin to waken pretty

Though the skies are dark and fretful,
An' the sunshine seems forgetful
He will come along an sing his little

He's a comforting reminder
That the world will soon grow kinder,
And the weather prophet's got to

With a cheerful disposition,
He will change his composition.
An' be singin' "fair and warmer" after

Oh, he ain't so influential,
Though his airs seem consequental,
But he offers a reminder straight and '

That the hour that seems so weary
With its storm clouds dark an' dreary,
Must be followed by the blossom and
the song.
