dasheries of this city making the
first complete prediction of modes

first moment winter turns tall to ad
in 1 1. spring, through to the very end

Next WedneHday, the 22nd day of

"event for Celina, the First Annual
Style Show Week, un institution
sponsored and planned by the Celina
Business Association. The show will
continue for the remainder of the
week, Thursday, Friday and Satur

Nothing but Uown-to-th-mlnute, ex
amples of suits, gowns, hats, shoes

being temporarily iu the background
as a style supplying center, Amerl
can designed and strictly tailored
suits, will be prominent. There is to
be a reflection of far away Chna In
some of the suits.
The Influence of Bakst's grotesque
colorings and the visit to this coun
try of the Imperial Russian ballet will
be felt to an extent in some lines
The range of the military domination
of dress will be confined almost whol
ly to braids and buttons.
Store Interiors Will Attract Crowds
This, In a very brief way, summar
izes the general trend of what Style
Show Week may be expected to im
peratively suggest. While windows
will of a certainty attract and absorb
the interest of hundreds during the
week, the store interiors will be more
attractive, so the newness and fresh
ness of the "to-be-prevailing" garm
ents will be as apparent inside the
shops as the "from the outside look
ing in" views the windows provide.
Participating establishments will
make small pretense to do little more
than abide within the strictest mean
ing of Style Show Week. All em
phasis will be to show, to display.
For the week selling has been in rea
lity given secondary importance.
MORE MONEY
BADLY NEEDED
The Ohio State Good Roads Fed
eration is feeling out public senti
ment on a proposed amendment to
the State Constitution of Ohio, which
if adopted will increase the state
good road tax levy from three tenths
of a mill to three-fourths of a mill
on each one dollar of taxable proper
ty in the State.
This increase would mean two and
one half times as much road tax paid
into the State Treasury as at present.
Other parties think that if the State
levy was made one half mill that a
sufficient sum would be raised to sup
port a strong road building program
in Ohio.
By this state levy the towns, cities
and public utilities are made to pay
two dollars every time the farmers
pay one dollar, and the farmers get
all the money for county roads.
Following is the proposed amend
ment. Head, study carefully, and
preserve for reference.
Amendment to Section 5, Article
XII of the Constitution Proposed by
Initiative Petition to be Submitted
Directly to the Electors.
Sec. 5 There shall be levied in the
year 1917, and in each of the nine
succeeding years thereafter, lrrespeo
tlv of and in addition to any limita
tion of the tax rate that may now or
here after be prescribed by law, a tax
of three-fourths of one mill on all the
taxable property within the state, the
same to be certified annually by the
Auditor of State to the Audiors of the
severay counties of the state as pro
vided by law, the proceeds of which
shall constitute The State Highway
Improvement Fund, and subject with
out appropriation by the legislature
to be expended in the Improvement
and maintenance of highways as now
or may hereafter be provided by law.
Any part of said Fund my be used
in co-operating with the govrenment
of the United States in the improve
ment of highways in this state. No
other tax shall be levied except in
pursuance of law, every law impos
ing a tax shall state distinctly the
object of the same to which it only
hall be applied.
POLITICAL
Among the Democratic announce
ments of candidates for Probate
Judge of Auglaize county appears the
"names of Dr. G. M. Raudabaugh, of
St. Marys, son of Mr. and Mrs. Albert
Raudabaugh, East Fulton street, and
a brother of Probate Judge Orvelle
Raudabaugh of this city. As a can
didate for the seme office there also
appears the name of Court Stenogra
pher Clifford O. Blair, of Wapakone
ta, a former resident of this city.
Ora L. Hinton, of St, Marys, a for
mer Liberty township boy and well
known here is also in the politcal
fight in Auglaize, being Democratic
candidate for Sheriff.
Judge S. S. Scranton, of Celina will
be a candidate for state senator.
This was an announcement of the
past week that interested democrats
of Mercer, Allen and Auglaize coun
ties especially, because Judge Scran
ton was once before a candidate for
this office and made a good showing.
He was formerly probate judge of
Mercer county and his qualifications
are excellent. Mercer has not had a
senator since the early 90's so it Is
expected some eyes will be turned
that way this time. Lima Daily

GOT PAVING FEVER
AT EAST END OF LIN
, St. Marys Argus
A petition seeking to pave with
concrete the St. Marys-Celna road be
liming at the St. Marys corporatlo
limits und extending thence to th
Mercer county lino to meet a simlla
project already launched by ("elin
citizens was filed Saturday by L. O
Needy with the Auglaize county com
mlssiuners.
A mllu ami a half stretch of road
near Kockford, Mercer county, more
than a year ugo was paved to a width
or sixteen feet at a total cost of nine
teen thousand dollars. The road Is
highly recommended. Sovenil St.
Marys township citizens along the
St. Marys-Cellna pike, after viewing
tho Kockford paving, came to St
Marys and volunteered to sign tho
Improvement petition. They pre
vioimly had declined to endorse the
project till personally informing
themselves on tho subject.
The effect of a well-paved road on
local trade Is conceded to be impor
tant. The paving of the west end of
the St. Marys-Cellna main road Is
said to make the paving of the east
end essential in order to preserve the
balance of trade between St. Marys
and (Jellna.
At Waste Weir Likely to
Be
Kept Closed
Until Arrival of Fish Screens for
Pond, Unless Fresnet Inter
feres With Plans.
Piles of dead shad along the banks
of Beaver near the new waste weir
are believed by Special Fish Game
Division Ontcer Herman Nohr, to
have given rise to a recent report that
approximately fifty-thousand pounds
of mostly game fish had gone through
the fumes at the new wier, while
large volumes of water were being let
out of the reservoir the past several
weeks.
Acting on tho report, Officer Nohr,
Canal Foreman J. W. Makley, of St.
Marys, Deputy Warden Leininger, of
tins city, ana several local nimrod en
thusiasts made a personal visit, Tues
day to the scene. A walk from the
north end of the bank to the waste
wier revealed one dead bass. A very
few dead crappies wer.e noted at the
wier or elsewhere. There were thou
sands of dead shad. It is believed
that a recent casual inspection of the
low lying banks whence the water
had receded gave a wrong impression
through lack of proper identification
of the kinds of fish.
Inquiry was made along the bank
for a distance of five miles along the
course of Beaver. Testimony was se
cured showing that two bass had been
found. There was a considerable
amount of crappies, it is conceded,
went through the waste wier. These
fish are prone to follow a current
without resistance; differing in this
respect from catfish and various oth
er varieties and similar to hickory
shad and carp. It is estimated that
perhaps one thousand pounds of crap
pies were lost in this way. The in
vestigation shows that the loss of
other kinds of game fish by getting
away was limited. Proper respect is
noted with regard to the sincerity of
those who made prior reports based
on what they had reason to think
were facts. Officer Nohr's experience
in this line adds weight to his official
opinion.
Gates at the west bank waste wier
have been closed tight. It is intend
ed to keep them closed at least till
the arrival and emplacment of the
fish screens which are due at any
time.
The stage of water is now fifteen
inches below high water mark. In
view of the fact that both banks are
protected by concrete, containing
walls, Mr. Nohr favors keeping the
gates closed except in the event of
unusual freshet, in order to Insure a
good stage of water for the summer.
As a warning against undue water
wasting he cites the present condi
tipn of Indan lake and Buckeye lake.
One of them is four and one-half feet
below normal; the other five feet be
low normal. Unless the water at
both places Is much elevated by the
spring rains, the season's business
will be seriously compromised. One
of the lakes is now to low to permit
motor boat navigation. If the situa
tion continues so it is believed a con
siderable per cent, of the patronage
can be diverted to this city and the
reservoir.
ORDER IS OUT FOR
OBSERVANCE I.O.O.F. DAY
Grand Sire Robertson, of the Inde
pendent Order of Odd Fellows, has
sent out the annual proclamation for
the due observance of the anniversary
of the order in this country and Ca
nada. Grand Master Edwin C. Wright
of the Grand Lodge of Ohio, has re
enforced the proclamation with a re
quest that the lodges In this state
take due cognizance of the 'event and
celebrate accordingly.
The Independent Order of Odd Fel
lows was established in the United
States of America on the 26th day of
April, 1819, when Thomas Wildy and
four compatriots instituted a lodge in
the city of Baltimore. The approach
ing anniversary is, therefore, the 97th
and the observance of the event is
becoming more general from year to
year.
The "Order of the Three Links", as
it is popularly called, has enjoyed a
tremenduous growth until it ranks
second to none in point of member
ship and financial resources. There
is scarcely a hamlet that does not
support a subordinate lodge, and a
majority of the lodges own their own
buildings. It is a beneficial institu
tion, and millions have been expend
ed for the relief of the distressed,
care of the sick and the maintenance
of homes for indigent Od4 Fellows,
their widows and orphans.
The Celina lodge has its own tem
ple on West Market street. The
building is a beautiful three-story
structure, one of the finest buildings
in town and one of the prettiest lodge
homes in this section.

With a lobby full of visitors, in
cluding the Board of Public Aflialrs
and its officers, the city Duds held a
lengthy susslon last Tuesday night.
All officers were present and Mayor
Scranton presided.
After the usual opening routine,
President T. A. Wels on' behalf of the
Board of Public Affairs presented to
Council a leport of the expenditures
of the $10,000 bond issue money
turned over to them a couple of years
ago for improvement of the plant

er line extensions and gave an esti
mate of the cost of the extensions.
At this point he took occasion to say
tliut unless provision was made to
secure more water the proposed ex
tensions would be useless as the wa
ter supply at present is so short that
a good fire protection stand cannot
be kept in the stand-pipe, in the re

well was put down by the Board last
week, the purchase of a new engine
at the light plant and other necessary
minor matters. The Boards estimate
of the cost of the entire completion
of this work is about $23,000. The
report was accepted and will be taken
up, probably, at the adjourned ses

A resolution accepting conditional
, the uncompleted sanitary sewer
system, left on the town's hands by
the defunct contracting firm of Mar

esolutions committee. The resolu
ion provides for the conditional ac
ceptance of the work now in, for the
use of the money held back on the job
to put the streets and alleys in pro
per repair, and for the sale of the un
completed work. The resolution was
referred to the sewer committee for
nvestigation and they will probably
report at the adjourned session to
night. F. W. Miller, who has purchased
the street sprinkler stated to Coun
cil that the Board of Public Affairs
had raised the price of water to him
from $100 to $200. He therefore
wants the Council to pay $75, instead
f $50 as heretofore for sprinkling
for street sweeping and for street and
alley intersections. The matter was
referred to the street committee.
Many minor matters came up and
were disposed of after which an ad-
ournment was taken until half past
