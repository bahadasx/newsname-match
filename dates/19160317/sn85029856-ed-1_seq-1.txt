Were Well Pleased With
"The Heart of the Rockies"
Tuesday noon we began thinking
of the "good old davs." Two or three
cowboys came riding down the stre -t,
tn Western regalia, mounted, and
ready for service. Sauntering along
with them was Jose, a Mexican, with
"high-topped, wide-brimmed sombrero,
and other parts of his apparel Indlcat
Ing that he was distinctively of Span
ish descent. Quite unconsciously the
years seemed to drift away, and be
fore our vision was mile after mile of
semi-arid lands, splattered with yucca,
mesqulte, plnon, cedar, and cactus;
with an occasional arroyo, a mesa,
and ever so many miles a Mexican hy
cal nothing to relieve the monotony
but the mirage that merged with the
horizon. The only thing that brought
us from this revery was a lively air
taken up by the Liberal City Band,
which reminded us, to our sorrow,
that it was nothing but a show after
all.
"The Heart of the Rockies," a ty
pical western play, which was
shown at the opera house Tuesday
night, was given under the avsplces
of the Liberal band, and under the
direction of Lenn Harris. Mr. Harris
is a man of wide experience in his
line, and chose a company of excep
tional merit which is said to rival
many of the professional thea'rical
companies now on the road. The
house was crowded, and tense dra
matic situations and sparkling humor
held the Interest of the audience till
the end. Special numbers by Paul
Stoufer, Dan Murphy, and Ruth Har
ris were loudly applauded, and the
specialties between acts were excep
tionally good and appreciated by all.
The Liberal band furnished special
music throughout the performance.
Taken all-in-all, "The Heart of the
Rockies" was the best local talent
play ever staged in the city.
There was some little misunder
standing concerning a banquet given
ai me Annex uaie airar ine snow
which the boys desire to be explained.
The band, to show its appreciation to
. the cast, gave the banquet, paying
for twelve plates out of the general
fund. The band boys also ate at this
banquet, but paid for same individu
ally. The band cleared from the play
more than so above any and all ex
penses, and desire to express their
thanks to the people of Liberal for
their support.

Auto Hearse for Liberal
Mr. and Mrs. David Curtis re
turned Tuesday from an extended
business and pleasure trip in Okla
homa and Iowa. Mr. Curtis wasin
Des Moines, Iowa, while away and
purchased an auto hearee for his
undertaking business. The new
hearse is made by the Des Moines
Hearse and Casket company, one ot
the biggest concerns of its kind in
the country. It will be mounted on
a Ford chassis and will be up-to-date
in every respect. Most vehicles at
funerals are automobiles and where
the old fashioned horse-drawn hearse
is used it makes it inconvenient for
those who drive to the cemetery. If
you are "dying for a ride" and will
wait a tew days for the new hearse
to get here, Dave will be able to take
care of you In proper style.

get a good grade.
