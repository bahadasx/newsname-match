sank early today off Ihe Norrd Hinder
lightship,,'as the result of striking a
'mine or an attack by a submarine. All
the passengers, among whom are said
to have been several Americans anu

ried between SO and !)t) passengers
and a crew of 300. She was a vessel
of 15,000 tons.
The Tubancia left Amsterdam Wed­
nesday for the liver I Mat to, and was
to have stopped at Falmouth for ad:
ditioual passengers and freight. Early
this morning wireless distress calls
from the steamer were received at the
Hook of Holland and torpedo, boats
and other craft rushed to her assist­
ance. Some of the boats reached the
steamer before she sank and took off
•passengers and members of the crew,

cia was Richard Schilling, described

Somewhere south of New Mexico, per­

divided forces lie is commanding are
in camp tonight. They have had no
encounter with Mexicans and their
progress into Mexico in search of Vil­

'Washington, March 1G.—An impen­
etrable wall of secrecy tonight .sur­
rounds the movement, of American
troops beyond the Mexican border.
So far as official Washington was ad­
vised, the column as well might have
vanished into thin air when lliey
crossed Ihe international boundary
yesterday in pursuit of Villa. Even
the commander-in-chief, President
Wilson, did not. know wnere General
Tersbing's men were.
Secretary Baker received virtually
no reports from 'Gen. Funston deal­
ing with events beyond the border.
(Late today he said he did not know
whether the troops had proceeded
southward from their first bivouac on
Mexican soil last night.
Not a single dispatch from the bor­
der was made public during tihe day,
except one, reporting the death of
Lieutenant Zell, Eleventh Cavalry, at
the Columbus hospital, where he
took his own life in a fit of despond­
ency.
Army officials were convinced that
no important developments were to
be expected for several days.
Consular advices today continued
to report generally quiet conditions.
Officials displayed some concern over
the situation in the Tampico district,
however, where there are signs of
unrest. The battleship, Kentucky,
was ordered back to Vera Cruz from
New Orleans, Secretary Daniels ex­
plaining that naval vessels now on
the Mexican coast did not. have radio
equipment powerful enough to insure
uninterrupted communication with
Washington.
The state department denied that
other American consuls than Consul
Williams at Torreon were leaving
their posts.

confined to his bed today under the
care of a physician as a result of his
efforts to prevent the execution of a
judement against him.
"The treaty between the United
States and Greece has been violated

Intentions A Mystery.
AVhat the intentions of Villa are re
:mained a profound mystery today.
Andres Garcia, the Carranza consul
here, asserted today that from infor­
mation in his possession he was satis­
fied that Villa had disbanded most of
his men and intended to take refuge
in the heart of the Sierra Madras
with only three or four tbusted com­
panions.
"Thousands of .men are not wanted.
to pursue Villa," said Consul Garcia.
"He has no intention of fighting any­
one, but will take refuge in the moun­
tains, which he knows so well. He
will be captured, I believe, when a
price is put on his head."
A flat denial that there were any
Carranza troops with the American
expedition was made today by Genera!
Gavira, the Carranza commander at
Juarez.
Fresh troops have arrived at Juarez
but the Mexican authorities could
give no estimate of the number of
men in the garrison there.
