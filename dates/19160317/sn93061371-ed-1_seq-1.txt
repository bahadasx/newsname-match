Arthur of the lleney l?eo in

his title of "Honey Jim".
Ho has always boen a hari
fighter for Democracy and for
advancement, betterment and
general progression o Chaves
county. His record for the past
thirty years is before you, and
rour clonest inepectisn of same
is invited,
berth trying to visualise Itib's" fc
and find comfort from it. She had bemi
such a tender little woman, after ell
ber own personal trouble. The only
kind thfng Kenneth had ever (lone for
her was to die. That had been four
years ago, and he and Lester bad
looked after her interests since thou.
They had been partners before the'
war, and he was ber brother.
The war had been a relief. At first
they had gone over to serve in the Bel
gian commiHslon. Lester had pulled
himself together aud got bin grip buck,
driving an ambulance there, and h
bimeHf bad slipped into the Foreigu
Legion.
When the train pulled into the ex
press station at Seventy-second street
he almost stumbled frcm the car.
Gee, but everything looked good after
those months In lielgittin. He crossed
the street and Went toward ber home in
the big apartment building on Ctntral
Park West. His fingers were. a bit un
steady as be found the hell and pressed..
It. The Uoof clicked and be .went up-'
stairs. And on his way a man pasel
him going down.
Gregory noticed him vaguely. Ha;
was short and stocky and looked pros
perous. Even to a casual observer be
appeared happy. And as he starteJ
paat him the man stopped short, took
another look at him and called: 'Hello,'
there, Creg!" 1
It was Stephens, his lawyer, good 1
old Steve who bad stood back of blui
over and over again, about the only!
friend be had bad IcTt after the bus!-;
ness had gone to the merry puppy'
dogs. Yet all he could do was grip hie .
hand and ask If Bab were still alive. ;
"Still alive? What do you mean, olaS
man? Of course, she's olive, but you're
one minute too late Kbe's done it." ;
"Done what? Mt.rried again?" ;.
"Lord, no. Go upstairs aud find out..
God bless you both. Wonderjtul worn-;
n, Greg. See you later."
Gregory climbed the last flight and
ehe opened the door herself. Not
word did she speak, ohly held out her
arms to .him, and somehow lie found
that it was his bead which lay on her ' '
shoulder' and he was holding her to -.
blin in dumb Joy.
"I met Stephen. He said I was too' -late."
he said finally when they were.'
In her library.
"You are. I signed the papers my
self. Listen and don't scold me. . I.eav
ter wrote when yott got buck to Eng-;
land and kept me pested, but he said:
ha thought you'd go back to France It.
your arm was well enough, and 1
think you've done quite enough for
them already. I need a little of you,
you know. So I sent the wireless te '
head you off, and, anyway, we needed!
you terribly. You see, I found out:
after you had been captured all about .
Lester's trouble and why my balance
Was safe and yours had gone with
him. It had been splendid of yon to
back him in all bis queer ideas any- ,
way, so I went out one day to Jersey
and looked over U14 old factory Just
as you hud,left It. You know I studied
tbemistry with Lester before 1 wa
tnarrled and it all interested me so
So I Just took out part of my money
and started in a small way. I told
Mr. Stephens what I wanted to do,
and he helped me, but I said it wan
your money. Well, I won out, autl
began making copper cylinders just as
you had Intended. So, 1 1 1 just paid
Off the mortgage myself. Mr. Stephens
has the check. I think I'm even with
you now. It's all over there ready for
you to go back to." ,
Crcgory was holding ber in bis good
arm, close to him, his face pressed t
her hair.
"Ob, you women, you women who
are the restorers!" Jie said.

To Make Metallic Magnesium.
A factory has been established at
Niagara Falls for the manufacture ef
metallic magnesium, which is the
lightest metal known, and is said to
have many qualities superior to alum
inum. The output of the factory baa
been contracted for , by the FrencX
government until the end of the war,
the material to be inado use of in the
manufacture of aeroplane parts. After
the demand for t'jls purpose has
ceased the company will engage in the
manufacture of household utensils,
and some interesting novelties will ba
brought out, it Is said.
