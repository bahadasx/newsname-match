CENTRAL BODY IS
ORGANIZED BY
All Local Craft Unions Tied Together
in Organization This Week Perfect
ed By President Doane of State Fed
eration ot Labor.
Following the strike which was
called by employees of the Shfiuion
Copper company at Metcalf last Thurs
day and v Inch spread to the reduc
t.un plant u; Clifton, oa the day '!
levin.-- Li'tler M. Doai President
the Ariiona Federation of Labor,
hurried forward the plan:: for the for
jiai.1011 in the distict of the Central
Labor Union, composed , of delegates
fr-m ilie several craf. unions in ihe
dl:j-.iii:t which body will in the future
approve or disapprove any contempla
ted strike in the district.
Accord'ng to President Doane, a
local craft union in the district hav
ing a grievance must first present that
grievance through its own . grievance
committee, to the employer, and fail
ing of satisfactory adjustment, the
grievance then must be submitted to
the Central Labor Union of the dis
trict and the consent and authority,
of 'the Central Labor body received
before any strike can be called by
any local organization at any point in
the district.
Mr. Doane was very positive in his
statements that this arrangement
which nas been perfected will prevent
any more such "flare ups" . as thai
which occurred at Morenci and Met
calf recently wfaen the mines and
smelters of two of the large operating
companies in the district were closed
down temporarily by the employees
without any effort being first made for
an adjustment of grievances.
In addition to the steps taken . by
the craft unions of the district, for the
organization of the Central Labor
Union, a committee of employees met
with the three managers of the dis
trict on Sunday last and rules and
regulations governing certain classes
of labor were mutually agreed upon
and these rules and regulations wll
be posted in conspicuous places- about
the works'ln the three camps.
It was announced that the Central
Labor Union is composed of delegates
from each local craft union on a
basis of one delegate for each craft
composed of twenty-five members or
less; three delegates to each craft
having membership of one hundred
and one delegate jfor each two' hun
dred and fifty members additional.
At the present time there are separ
ate craft unions in the district as
follows:
Morenci Miners Union, Metcalf Min
ers Union, Clifton Miners and Smelter
Electricians, Boilermakers, Machinists,
Carpenters, Chauffeurs, Barbers, and
Federal Inion.
In addition to the above named local
craft unions the stationery engineers
have applied for a charter, also the
painters. '
Grievance committees representing
the employees of the operating com
panies are to be chosen at a referen
dum election to be held next week
and according to previous agreement
meetings will be held with the mine
managers monthly for discussion of
questions of mutual interest.
Federal Investigator Myers who
came here from El Paso on Friday
last when he was advised of the strike
at the Shannon mine, has remained in
the district this week and addressed
several meetings of the employees of
the three camps and impressed upon
them the necessity of orderly and
(harmonious action and pointed out
the injustice to the mining companies
by the recent strike at the Shannon
and Morenci over a comparatively triv
ial grievance which could no doubt
have been satisfactorily adjusted oth
erwise. President Doane left Clifton Wed
nesday morning for his home in Globs
and will vis-it Phoenix, - Bisbee and
Douglas before returning to the dis
trict. Mr. P. P. Murray has been
selected to represent the State Federa
tion in this .District so far as organi
zation is concerned.

COMMITTEE WILL
, LEAVEiliDAI
Meeting With : ' Mine Managers of
Woriollon D-strict For Preimjinaiy
Estimate on Connecting Highway Is
Ari ant;ed.
Leavng Clifton on Monday nxt and
arriving at Jackson, New Mexico, at
nocn on tht following day, a commit
tfc r.'M'esenting the Greenlee County
Chamber of Commerce, County lin-gineei-
Kedd and a member of the
Board of Supervisors, will meet
Messrs. S. J. Kidder and A. -T. An
derson managers of mining compan
icj 111 i"; Mogollon disrict, an;i i;ie
entire party will go 'over the propos
ed route of a connecting highway be
tween Greenlee county and the Mog
ollon Mining district. ' ;
The party who will go from Clif
ton will probably Include W. B. Kelly,
President; and W. S. Bradfleld,
Secretary of the Chamber . of Com
merce; R. R. Webster," Jas. H.
Kerby, Wade Hampton, S.- C. Redd,
County Engineer; and W. T. Witt,
Chairman of the Board of Supervisors.
The party will go overland on horse
back and Mr. Redd will make a pre
liminary estimate of the cost of con
struction on the Arizona side of the
state boundary. . . -
At mule Creek the party will also
be joined by ranchers in that section
who are enthusiastic supporters of
the road proposition.
The mine managers at Mogollon
nave for some time evidenced a
lively interest in a co-operative plan
whereby a road would be constructed
which would give them a shorter haul
for their supplies and products to a
railway point. It is estimated that
a highway between Clifton and
Mogollon would reduce the distance
approximately twenty-five miles as
between Clifton and Silver City, and
would be mutually advantageous to
both localities.

STAT:! WANTS FOREST LANDS
FHOENIX Arizona's representa
tives in Congress are being asked to
bring about legislation which would
permit Arizona through the state land
department to file on land in the for
est reserve and also to secure water
power sites on the Colorado river in
the Grand Canyon region. By reason
of the recently created Papago re
servation Arizona will be compelled
to select 220,000 acres of land some
where else in the state. Unless some
of this land can be selected within a
forest reserved will be very difficult
fo the state to find suitable land
to take the place of that recently lost.
It is pointed out that in case the
state should be able to select water
power sites in the canyon that it
could construct and operate power
plants under the industrial pursuits
act which was adopted by the people
in 1914.
On Leave of Absence-
Sheriff James G. Cash left on
Sunday morning for a visit to his
old home in Texas, having been
granted a leave of absence for thirty
days. '

THUS SHE IS BRIDE
OF THAW
Isabel Kingson, School Teacher Waits
For Lover; Adjudged Insane, She Is
Conveyed, Fighting to Asylum.
PHOENIX Believing herself to be
the-promised bride of Harry K. Thaw,
Isabel Kingston yesterday sat on the
veranda of the Phillips House to
await ais coming. When Deputy
Sheriff Cra Matthev accompanied
by two other attaches of the sheriff's
office ca'led to take Miss Kingston
to Judge Lyman's court where her
sanity was to be inquired into, she
declared it was nothing more nor less
than a conspiracy to prevent her from
meeting her lover.
Thaw, she said, was protecting her
from white slavers. He had followed
them from Los Angeles to Seattle and
would save her from them even as he
had once saved another from Stanford
White.
In taking her to the state asylum for
the insane the officers told her that
she was going to the country estate of
Thaw where the marriage would be
performed at once.
Miss Kingston gave her age as thirty
three and fcaid she had .taught school
ever since she was seventeen, at one
time being connected with the Los An
geles public schools and that she had
also taught in San Diego. She has
been' in Phoenix since the first of the
year. . Her sisters in Boston were no
tified of her condition a few weeks ago
though she was not nearly as violent
as she has been the past few days.
They replied that they would come to
Phoenix.
Within the last week Miss Kingston
has terroized the neighborhood in
which she lived by carrying a loaded
gun. Recently she sat on the veranda
of the Griswold home, 356 North Third
avenue watching patiently for Mr.
Thaw. She fought like a tigress when
taken to court.

EINCI LEADER
MURDERED BEFORE
.FATE OF
DR. HART
Am a Government Inspector," said
Hart to Bandits, With Hands Up.
"No le Hace." Thev Renlied: Char-
vred Fragments of Body Remain "
DOUGLAS Details of the tragic
death of Dr. Harry M. Hart, who lost
hia life In the Villa raid on Colum
bus, became available with the return
from Col ambus last night of A. C.
Davis, D. C; O'Neal, W. de H.
Tasfoington and J. J. Neary, the
first three having been sent as - a
committee by the local lodge of Elks.
VThat Dr. Hart was killed ' and
taen his body cremated is their state
ment. Mrs. W. T. Richie, wife of
the proprietor of the Commercial
hotel, who was himself killed" in the
raid, was an eye witness to the mur
der of Dr.. Hart.
, Dr. Hart arrived at 11:30 Wednes
day night from El Paso and went to
the Commercial Hotel, retiring ' at
once. When the Villistas raided the
town a bunch of them entered trie
hotel,' which was located on the sec
ond story of a business block. They
knocked on the door of the room oc
cupied by Dr. Hart, who as far as
known was still asleep, as he was a
heavy sleeper. ".
Murdered in Cold Blood
Before the doctor had time to open
the ' door the bandits began to kick
it down and demand that the occu
pant came out. Dr. Hart evidently
slipped on his trousers, as a blood-
soaked piece of his suit was later
then saoved and kicked him to the
: bottom of the steps, where he fell in
"a heap. Mrs. Ritchie saw this and

Mrs. J. J. Moore Fought Three Villa
Bandits; Husband Was Killed.
EL PASO, March 15 Mrs. J. J.
Moore, wife of the rancher who was
killed by Villistas in their retreat
from Columbus, and who was wounded
in the left leg by a pistol shot, left
for Ohio Monday afternoon. Since the
day following the tragedy on -the bor
der Mrs. . Moore has been at
Hotel Dieu and, because of her nerv
ous condition and the constant fear
she would be attacked by Mexicans,
friends arranged that she be sent to
her people in Bucyrus, Ohio.
Mrs. Moore told Miss Treva Blair of
El Paso that she and Mr. Moore "had
watched the battle in town from their
front porch and that, when the retreat
occurred, they had gone into the house
and locked the door.
Moore Killed
Mexicans then rode up to the house
and called Moore out, She said. The
door, which had a safety attachment
closed behind him and while h stood
on the porch he was killed.
"The Mexicans then broke through
a window and the next thing I knew
I was fighting with three of them,"
she said. "I do not know wrat hap-
jpened then nor do I know who the
Mexicans were.save that among those
that rode up to the house were sev
eral Mexlvans I had seen about Colum
bus, especially one who was a hunch
back." Mrs. Moore said that several . rings
had been torn from her hands, but
that her diamonds had been placed in
a matchbox and were not discovered
by the bandits. She also said that her
silveuware had been hid in a box back
of the bath tub and that this was
overlooked .
The ranch house where Moore was
killed is two miles south of Columbus
and between that town and the bor
der. It was directly in line with 'the
Villa retreat. When the Ameircan sol
diers returned to camp they found
I Mrs. Mooro in the field, where she
I was unconsefcms. She was carried
into the house and an ambulance later
j carried her to Columbus.

SHANNON STRIKE
IS BROUGHT TO
Grievance Commitee and General
Manager Bennie Reach Mutual Un
derstanding and Mines and Plant
Operating as Uusual
' As a result of a- meeting between
General Manager Bennie, of the Shan
non Copper Co., and a grievance com
mittee of employees of the company,
held on Monday of this week, the
incipient . strike, ' inaugurated last
Friday, was ended.
The miners at the Shannon return
ed to work on Tuesday and the
smelter was again in operation today,
after a shut down. of a week.
It developed that organized labor in
the district was not . in sympathy
with the hasty "action of the miners
at the Shannon and officials of the
Central Labor Union make the as
sertion that such Incidents will not
occur again.
Federal Investigator Myers who
was in the district this week, having
been called here on account of the
strike, impressed upon ' the foreign
element the necessity for regular and
orderly procedure in the adjustment
of any real or imagainary grievances
in the future.
The places of the Mexicans ' who
walked out at the Shannon concentra
tor were filled by American employees
during the first part of the week, but
in the final juadstment of the griev
ances, the Mexican employees were re
instated, tie' Amercans who had ac
cepted employment, however, being
retained in other positions.

THE UNITED STATES WILL
NOT FALTER NOW
( Doii glas International) '
The United States troops are going
to Mexico to capture Pancho Villa;
that is the order and whatever the
cost or the number of men required
for this order it must be carted out.
According to the reports from Wash
ington yesterday the
agreement of
til' r-encent to nave tne carran.a
forces to cross into the United States
in pursuit of bandits that may go
from the United States to Mexico
and commit depredations was receiv
ed with favor by Gen. Carranza.
jCarransa is the one man who can
prescribe the activities of the Ameri
can forces in Mexico. They go under
orders to capture Villa. Other duties
could be added to the invading force
should occasion arise demanding that.
If Carranza orders his forces to co
operate with the United States in the
copta.-e of Villa then tiio friendship of
jlio twe ne.tions should remain undis
turbed. If Carranza or any one' under
his control should in any way inter
fere or prescribe the actions of our
troorvs in Mexico, then there would
I be more trouble and the purposes of
the United States in Mexico would be
enlarged.
Let us hope that the accomplish
ment of the present purpose of the
Mexico invasion may be accomplished
without the disturbance of the present
friendly feeling of this country
Mexico.
