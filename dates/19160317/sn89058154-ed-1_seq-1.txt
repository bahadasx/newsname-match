. GOOD ROADS. '
We have been, requested by our
esteemed subscribers tr press the
collar on the good roads question.
It seems that enough has been
printed on the question to make
the'whple county lined with good
roads, yet the same old mudholes
are on every road in the county.
If each farmer and live citizen
would take hold of the proposition
as oerspnal to himself, the roads
would be put in passable condition.
It must be done in this county by
the 'people living on the roads
and al! who travel over them. -
They must see where it is their
money interest to have good
roads. The money interest must
be backed by some civic pride to
no longer be the tag end of prog
. res3 and modern civilization.
The conditions in Mexico are
anything but serene. Our gov
ernment is massing troops as fast
us possible along the border and
will, if not already, enter Mexi
can territory seeking the arrest
of Gen. Villa and his band of as
sasins who crossed the line last
week at Columbus, Arizona, and
killed a nnmber of American sol
'diers and fled across the line af
ter a severe engagement- Pres
ident Carranza has entered a full
fledged protest against entering
Mexican territory unless the same
privileges are accorded him if an
occasion arises. This probably
will be granted, but war or no
war, our troops will follow the
brigands into any section of Mex
ico they lead. At this writing it
is hard to determine the outcome,
but that something is going on
that will make history, is clearly
to be seen. In one week from
now Villa' may be af the head of
an army with Can anza. If war
must come, it would be as well
now and one of severity, and for
punitive punishment or otherwise

NEW YORK
LETTER
Editor Independent:
References was made, in former
letters, to the Holy Rollers, a peculiar
set of religious enthusiasts who sprang
into the public's notice in the West
and even as far east as Maine) some
years ago, and it may be of interest
to some readers to know just what
those people did that brought them
into such notoriety.
Religon is a very personal and sa
cred thing. Almost any kind of re-
igious belief is better than none. I
have more regard for an honest Mo
hammedan than for an atheist. Faith
in a future life, and in "the substance
of things not seen" appears to be nec
essary to the mental and mpral devel
opment of mankind, and I am far from
desiring to make iight of,, religion'.
But fanatics have gone too far -in
their teachings and practices, and are
to be classed with dangerous people.
T iL- 1- '-." 1. '
rrimiuve peopra are mucu mure
emotional than those who have rubbed
against the so-called cutture of the
world. My mother used to tell me of
the old-fashioned camp-meetings in
McNairy county, at which the women,
and even the men, got to shouting at
the top of their voices, with happy
religious feeling., while some would
fall in a faint. Who would wish to
take away from them their happiness,
and who could claim that they were
any the worse for 'their momentary
exhaltation? Bat when it comes to
getting so intoxicated with the Spirit
that one has to roll on the floor like a
drunken person, and jibber like an
idiot, the thing has gone too far.
Many of as have heard negroes at
their worship, when after about elev
en hours' of loud exhortation on the
part of tha leather-lunged preachers,
the black listeners were worked op to
a high pitch of frenzy. My father,
who had a keen sense of humor, once
described part of a negro Methodist
service he heard in Atlanta, Georgia.
The dusky preacher was lambasting
old Satan at a great rate, and from
various parts of the church came such
expressions of approval as: "Dat's
right, preacher;" "Lord grant it." Fi
nally, in a burst of eloquence, the old
preacher cried out: ' 0 Lord, we doo
pray thee to curtail the powers of the
Debbiir and a black brother some
where in a corner sang oat: "Dat's
right, Lord! Cut his tail smack, smoof
off." . "
The Holy Rollers
were somewhat
like the Holiness people, "only much
more so.". They believed they were
incapable of committing anymore sin,
and that the Holy Ghost descended in
to their bodies and made its presence
felt by the "unknown tongue " an in
coherent babbling of sounds which
were no words at all, but which were
hailed by the Rollers as a sure sign
of their final acceptance and redemp
tion. .
A shrewd fanatic who called him
self Adam God, and claimed to be the
brother of Jesus Christ, went through
Missouri and Kansas eight years ago,
and-had quite a following. They lived
on what they could pick up by the
wavBide, and preached their weird
doctrine of fire and brimstone and of
damnation to everybody but those who
chose to think as thry did. The lead'
er declared that he was immortal;
that neither fire nor weapon could in
jure him, and that be was born in
heaven. Several families followed
him, men, women and children, and
one day they went into Kansas City.
They were praying on the streets al!
day, but at night retired to the house
boats which they had on the river
The laws of the city required that al!
children under a certain age be in
school, and when the officer told Adam
God that the young ones in his crowd
must go to school, he answered
"Christ never went to school; are they
better than he was?" Then the of
ficer tried to arrest him. He resist
ed, and others of his sect ran to his
rescue with drawn revolvers, and soon
there was a battle on the streets, in
which some people were killed and
Dumoer wounaea, including tne re
doubtable Adam God himself, who had
both hands shot He succeeded in es
caping, but the sight of his bleeding
hands took the nerva out of the oth-

ers, who saw that he could be wound
ed, just like anybody else, and they
surrendered. The leader hid himself
in a corn-shock somewhere out in the
country, and had a farmer feed him
with his own hands, as he said his
hands were paralyzed, and he had to
keep them in his pockets. , Adam God
was soon run down, however, and tried
for starting the riot that cost a num
ber of lives. He was sentenced to
the penitentiary for life, and that put
a damper on the foolish movement he
had been leading. v
In February, 1908, 1 was at Eureka
Springs, Arkansas, a little town nest
led among the Ozark mountains; a
great summer resort, for the springs
are very healing, especially for suffer
ers from Bright's disease. Word came
that the Holy Rollers were in town,
and I went to see their meeting, in an
abandoned skating rink somewhere in
town. No church would open to them.
I heard the sound of the services from
afar, and when I entered, there was a
swarthy man with iron-grey hair wav
ing his arms and yelling in very illit
erate language, at the little congre
gation.' Loudness has long been es
teemed as a special virtue among the
backwoods clergy. My father told
me of hearing, when he was a boy,
some discussion about the new preach
er that had come id. A very old man
expressed his doubts' about the man's
ability, saying: "He aint nothin' to
compare with Brother smallwood
Why, when that there man Sraallwood
preached, you could hear his voice
ee-ko away off down in the boiler!"
Well, the Roller man was in the same
class of loud ones. They said he had
been preaching abont three hours
when I got there. He got into a kind
of a sing-song, and at the end of
sentence would catch his breath with
a deep-drawn "ah!" that was tiresome
to listen to. He declared that all
signs pointed unerringly to the early
destruction of the world and of all
flesh.
"Why," he yelled, marching back
and forth and swinging his arms,
"Mankind is a-gittin' smartern the
God that made rim! Ye know that
sort of business can't keep up. Hit
used to be that we wuz satisfied with
one mail a week; now we make a fuss
if we don't git it three times a day.
There's more inventions made now in
an hour than used to be in a year. 0,
yes, man knows it all, Vow; there aint
no more for him to learn. The pres
ident of the Patent Office in Wash
ington t'other day jiat throwed up his
hands and said the patents was a-com-in'

fool God Almighty. Man, with all
his smartness, is got to go. The
world will ketch fire in October, 1914,
a little over six years from now,'" and
then, whur'll you be, pore sinner? Ah,
when you're down thar in, hell, the
fires jist a eatin' the flesh off your
bones, yore beggin' and yore hollerin
wont do you no good; then you"ll
think about thia-hyur meeting and how
pore Jim Loller, in his pore, weak
way,' tried to keep you out of that
awful place. 0, brother-H), sister!
Don't ye hear them devils a-yellin an'
them flames a-roarin' and them pore
sinners a screaminT
After about the fourth hour of this
sort of stuff, one old lady's nose and
chin were seen to wobble towards
each other, and she jabbered some
thing that sounded idiotic. Then a
little girl took up the chatter in a
louder key; a thin, pale fellow that
looked like he had chills all his life,
took up the jabbering, -and ' soon it
sounded like a great bee-hive, buzzing
from one end of the room to the oth
er. The old lady sank to the floor,
and was soon followed by many oth
ers, while the preacher, now quite
hoarse from his long effort, went from
one to the other, putting his hands on
their heads and saying: "That's right,
brother! that's right sister! Speak
out, and let the Holy Ghost have its
way with ye!" "We-we-we, blab-blab,
blub-blub. wonk-wank; pip-pop-pup,"
went the crazy talk, while the thor
oughly hypnotized people rolled this
way and that on the floor, slowly, and
their eyes and lips incessantly wab
bling. This scene was repeated sev
eral nights in succession, and three
women went crazy. One knelt down
in the main street of the little town,
screaming and calling upon God to
save it from destruction; another
gave her husband three days to get
the Holy Ghost or clear out, and an
other was found wandering in the
mountains with her babies, seeking
the New Jerusalem. Finally the au
thorities of Euraka Springs gave "pore
old Brother Loller" orders to move on
He was about to set half the town
crazy. But I have often thought
abont how near he came to predicting
the world war of 1914.

Death ot Elder R. P. Meeks.
, Elder Rufus P. Meeks died Sunday
in St Joseph Hospital at St. Louis,
aged 67 years. He had been at the
hospital for several months, and after
a surgical operation it seemed he
found relief, but complications set in
and he passed to the great beyond.
He was born and reared in this
county, being the son 'of Gen. John
H. Meeks, and a brother of Judge M.
IL Meeks of Nashville, . He had been
a preacher forty-three years. He was
a preacher boy, and devoted bis entire
life to the preaching of the gospel as
expounded by the Christian church.
He was the author of a number of
religious works. At the time of his
death he was pastor of the- Clinton,
Ky., church, and for a number of
years had made his home at Hum
boldt, Tenn. He is aarvived by bis
widow and one son and one daughter.
. We hardly expect that there is a
church-goer in McNairy county who
has not heard him preach. He was a
consecrated and humble minister and
a foscef ul speaker and devout , work
er. ,;..
Interment was had at Tuesday at
Humboldt.
We extend to to (he family ' out
condolence in 'their great beareave-
ment. ' .'. . '
The Revival.
Rev. W, C. Swope begin his pro
tracted meeting Monday, preaching
each morning and evening.' The at
tendance so far as not been large, on
account of rather bad weather. The
divine seems to be a most earnest and
consecrated man. He has a style pe
culiar to himself. He is no orator,
but speaks in a monotone without in
flection or emphasis, and at such a
rapid rate that it taxes his hearers to
keep the pace.
Just how long the meeting will con
tinue, we are not advised. Consid
erable interest is manifested and it is
hoped much good will be done.

CATTLE DEHORNING
PAYING PROPOSITION!
,(By C. D. Lowe, Division of Extension
: University of Tennessee.)
There to not a single step In thej
handling of live stock that return a
bigger profit oil the first cost than the
simple act of dehorning. ,
The presence of horns on cattle oa
ale at the large central markets gen-'
erally means that those cattle will fell
for from 15 cents to 25 cents per huni
dred pounds leas than otherwise
There U only one argument In favor
of horn and that Is the value of the
horn, as a by-product of slaughter, toe
the manufacture of buttons, etc
Horns Interfere greatly in the feed
lot with the development of a uniform
bunch of cattle; they also are trouble
some in the car when shipping. In
fact, they serve no good purpose at
any time, on market animals.
Methods of doing away with horns
are simple. -In the first place they
may be bred off, by using a polled bull.
Practically all breeds of- cattle now
have polled strains. - '
Arresting the development of th
horn, by application of caustic when
calf la from three to seven days old la
another easy way.
Actual removal of the horn witH
clipper of saw, if properly done in
early fall, will not affect the animal
greatly, but should be done whila
young, before horn has reached large)
size. Care must be used to cut close)
enough to the head to insure that no
stubs follow. A ring of hair should
come off with the horn.
Bleeding is many times quite ezces'
live in removal of horns from mature)
heavy horned animals, therefore, sucfi
should be watched. i
It is usually not necessary to apply(
antiseptics or ointments to the stumps)
in this climate, if operation la perform
ed in cool season when 11 tee are ab
sent
In any event, get rid of the nornej
It wlU pay and pay well.
