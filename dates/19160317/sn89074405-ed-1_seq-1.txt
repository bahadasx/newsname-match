Sunk Thursday.
Amsterdam. March 17.—The newest
and finest steamship sailing under
the Dutch flag, the Tubantia of the
Holland-Lloyd line, was sunk shortly
before dawn yesterday 30 miles oft
the Dutch coast.
Although it is not positively estab
lished whether the sinking was due
to a mine or a torepdo, there is sin
gular unanimity on the part of her
passengers and crew in attributing It
to the act of the aubmarine.

Anger General.
The disaster has created profound
sensation throughout Holland, where
the ship was a great popular favorite
owing to its size and luxurious apart

anger and Indignation. The Nlewe
Kotterdamsche Courant says:
"No word can be found to qualify

Upholds Administration in
Address at Jackson Day
Dinner.
Concord. X. H., March 17.—A de
tailed eulogy of the work of the exe
cutive and legislative branches of the
federal government under democratic
control, was delivered by United
States Senator Robert Owen of Ok
lahoma at a Jackson dinner of New
Hampshire democrats here. Senator
Owen took up the important measures
passed by congress since the inaugur
ation of President Wilson, summariz
ing his conclusions thus:
"All these bills—the tariff bill, the
federal reserve act, the Clayton anti
trust bill, the federal trade commis
sion bill, the seamen's act—have had
one purpose—the promotion of the
common good, the abatement of
monopoly, the betterment of mankind,
the lowering of the cost of living and
the greater happiness of all our peo
ple."
.Senator Owen praised the work of
the various executive departments,
continuing:
"Perhaps the greatest accomplish
ment. the one for which our people
are now deeply grateful than any oth
er, is that the president has kept us
out of war and in a condtlon of pro
found peace while all the world be
side seems torn with war or Internal
violence. Under extreme provocation,
the president nevertheless has used hia
great powers and his great Influence
against any act that would involve the
people of the United States In war
either with the weakest of our neigh
bor nations, or with the strongest na
tions of the world, such as Great Bri
tain and Germany, both of whom be
cause of the excitement and stress of a
life and death struggle, have disre
garded In various ways the interna'
tlonal law and our legal rights. An
administration less wise and less
thoughtful might easily have been
swept lato war with Mexico, with Ger
many apd Austria, or with Great Bri
tain infi its allies."
Referring to the address of Ellhu
Root atthe Mem York republican con
vention/-Mr.-Owen said:
"Mr, Root, as the mouthpleoe and

RUSSIA WATCHING
FOREIGN EXCHANGE
Washington, March 17.—Close sup
ervision and regulation of exchange
transactions is being enacted by the
Russian government according to con
sular advices. A central committee
of the ministry of finance passes on
every application for exchange. Banks
must arrange payment through a spe
cial credit chancellery of the ministry
of finance, which receives dally state
ments of each bank's needs. All offers
from abroad are put Into a general
pool and apportioned. These restric
tions, the advices say, already have
resulted in better exchange rates.
CLASS FIGHTS ARE
TO BE ABOLISHED
State College, Pa., March 17.—Class
fights at the Pennsylvania state col
lege today were abolished by a unani
mous vote of the student body. There
was not a dissenting ballot in the
2,000 cast. Agitation against continu
ance of the custom has been spread
ing since the recent fatality in the
bowl fight at the University of Penn
sylvania.
For more than a decade Penn state
sophomores and freshmen have staged
three class fights annually, the "elder
scrap" and "pushball fight" In the
fall, and the "flag scrap" in the
spring. During' the last three years
more than 1,000 students have par
ticipated in each event. No serious
injuries have resulted.
Denver, Qol., March 17.—Frank
Shercllffe, alias Herman W. Morris,
serving a 26-year sentence for mur
der in the Colorado penitentiary, was
granted an unconditional pardon late
today by Governor George A. Carlson,
upon recommendation ot the state
board of pardons.
After reviewing the case in which
Shercllffe was convicted of killing
John W. Walsh, a miner at Leadvllle,
In 1893, the board, in a formal state
ment, said:
"It Is the unanimous opinion of the
board that Shercllffw Is not guilty of
the offense for which he was Incarcer
ated In the Colorado prison that hs
was not sent to the penitentiary to
vindicate any wrong he had done, but
because he had turned from ,his past
crimes and against criminal' associ
ates and gave aid to the state to pun
ish wrongdoers. We feel that it is
the duty df the state to sustain a man
in his effort to aid the state by pro
viding evidence rather than to permit
him to be punished for It."
The board declared that the princi
pal evidence against Shercllffe was a
letter purporting to have been writ

tical leadc* of Qmaha, Ni»W while the
former wis servlng a prison, sentence

REPUBLICANS AND
DEMS REPRESENTED
Speaker Clark and Repre
sentative Gordon Both in
Favor of Action.
Washington, March 17.—Under the
rule which limited the general debate
to 10 hours, tlie house began consid
ering the army bill—the most exten
sive proposal for increasing the mili
tary establishment ever laid before it
in peace times. If possible the final
vote will be reached tomorrow night.
Forty Want Time.
Forty speakers have asked for time.
The republicans and democrats are
equally represented on the list, and
all expected to favor the wide degree
of national preparedness whatever
their attitude might be on the com
mittee bill.
Chairman Hay of the military com
mittee and Representative Kahn, a
ranking republican member, were ap
portioned 10 hours equally. No gen
eral opposition is la evidence.
Clark Favors It.
Speaker Clark, who will deliver an
address in support of the measure,
surrendered the chair to Representa
tive Garett of Tennessee at the begin
ning of the debate. Representative
Gordon, a democrat, of Ohio, led off
for the bill. He had been listed as an
anti-preparedness man, but explained
his opposition only to a great standing
army.
McCumber Speaks.
Washington, March 17.—While the
house was debating the army bill the
final draft of the senate army bill was
favorably reported by Chairman
Chamberlain. Senator McCumber, re
publican, of North Dakota, made a
speech urging the country not to be
swayed from the middle course be
tween war hysteria and utter defense
lessness.

Detroit, Mich., March 17.—In the
arrest of Emil West, an employe of a
local wholesale drug corncern, and a
raid on his rooms, federal officials
claim to have uncovered one of the
biggest habit-forming drug thefts they
have ever known.
In the rooms, they declared, two
suitcases filled with drugs were found.
The officials said the drugs were stol
en from West's employers. They plac
ed the wholesale value of the seizure
at $50,000, but said it could be re
tailed among drug users for fully
1300,000.
According to the federal authorities.
West formerly was a prisoner at the
Jefferson City, Mo., penitentiary, and
had a market for drugs in that city.
He is said to have admitted that he
served a five-year term there under
the name of A. J. Huther.
James J. Brady, collector of inter
nal revenue here, said the federal au
thorities have been working on the
case for more than a month.

Shercllffe served1 eight years of his
sentence. Three times in six years
Frank Shercllffe, alias Sherman W.
Morris, applied to the board of par
dons for release from the state peni
tentiary. At each hearing counsel for
Shercllffe contended his conviction
and continued imprisonment resulted
from activities of Dennlson.
A majority of the board favored
Shercllffe's release as innocent of the
charge at the first hearing in Febru
ary, 1910, but no action was taken be
cause of the opposition United States
Senator John F. Shafroth, then gov
ernor. Another effort in his behalf
proved fruitless during the in
cumbency of Ellas M. Amnions as
governor.
Prior to his trial at Lea4ville, Sher
cllffe lived several years in Iowa,
where Albert B. Cummins, then gov
ernor, refused all requests for his ex
tradition on the grounds that charges
made in other states were false. Sher
cllffe left Iowa quietly for Michigan to
obtain employment as a cabinetmak
er. He was arrested In Michigan, ex
tradited to Minnesota, where he was
tried and acquitted on a .charge of
holding up and robbing a Great Nor
thern limited train. Shercllffe then
was extradited to Colorado and tried
on the Walsh charge. While being
taken from Leadville to Canon City

Close Watch is Being Kept
on Adherents of
Carranza.
El Paso, Tex., March 17.—A few
definite facts about the American ex
pedition into Mexico stood out with
considerable clearness, as a result of
official published reports and news
brought here by Americans who had
been in touch with some portion of
the American government. It seemed
certain that of the two columns, which
"are somewhere in Mexico," one is
constituted for speed while the other
is apparently moving more slowly.
The swift-footed column is an auxil
iary army, seemingly mostly made up
of cavalry, which went into Mexico
50 miles west of the main army of
General Pershing, when his forces
crossed at Columbus.
Movements Secret.
The secrecy which has surrounded
the movements of the main column
has been slight compared with that on
this western fajre. There is reason
to believe from the official announce
ments, that the western column may
have gone into Mexico earlier than
the main. bodv
Every report^wwught, here from the
border asserts jtlje western wing has
traveled much-the farthest.
By these samf report#? the two col
umns will form, a junction near the
threatened American Mormon colon
ists. possibly in the Casas Grandes
region.
Fight Expected.
Expectation along the border is
keyed to its highest pitch by the gen
eral belief that before nightfall the
advance guard of the American ex
peditionary force will have entered
the Villa territory in the mountains of
the Casas Grandes region of Mexico.
While the censorship prevented any
official news of the whereabouts of
the American columns from leaking
out, reports brought by Americans
from the interior coupled with the
calculations of men thoroughly famil
iar with the territory over which the
expeditionary force is passing, made
it reasonably certain that the United
States soldiers must be close to the
district where Villa is believed to ex
ercise his greatest influence and to
have the largest number of sympa
thizers.
Watch Mexicans.
With the possibility that actual
fighting with Villa men might begin
at any moment, interest was redou
bled In every item of intelligence that
could throw any light on the position
of the Carranza adherents, and more
especially on that of the five detach
ments of Carranza troops, who are de
clared by the Carranisa government
to be operating against Villa.
Revolts Rumored.
Rumors of disaffection and revolt
among the Carranza troops are plenti
ful here, but all available information
is to the effect that thus far at least,
Carranza and his lieutenants have
maintained strict order. There seems
to be no question that in a consider
able section of Mexico the people bit
terly resent the presence of American
troops in their country.
PAPER CHARGES

Berlin. March 1 7.—Wireless to Say

Night Marches Plan.
Night marches will probably be
made by General Pershing's expedi
tionary forces in their search for
Villa, it was indicated today at Fort
Sam Houston.
Night marches would help to mys
tify Villa as to the movements of the
American columns and would be easy
of accomplishment, it was said, be
cause there would be sufficient light
for that purpose. Also night marches
would keep the men and horses
fresher. The day will be used for
reconnoitering only, and daylight
inarches make it impossible to hide
the troop's movements. Huge clouds
of dust which indicate the marchers*
progress, are visible at great distances.

Questions.
New York, March 17.—John Grant
Lyman, awaiting trial here on a
charge of swindling investors
throughout the country in a stock
selling scheme operated under the
name of John H. Putnam & Co., was
adjudged in contempt of the federal
district court yesterday for refusing
to answer questions in connection
with the bankruptcy proceedings
against the firm of which he was
head.
Lyman's mother-in-law, Mrs. Jane
Hartman, ignored a subpoena served
upon her, and it was announced an at
tachment would be issued to compel
her to attend the hearing. Lyman,
accompanied in court by his wife,
would not even admit his identity,
persisting, when questioned, in the re
ply: "I decline to answer." Judge
Hough became impatient with the
erstwhile stock brokers and declar
ed that if Lyman succeeded in ob
taining the necessary bail to free him
from prison on the swindling chargc,
the court would recommit him for
contempt.
Lyman has been imprisoned in the
Tombs since he was returned here a
few weeks ago from Florida, where
he fled after the exposure of his al
