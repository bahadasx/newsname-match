Adrian Wire Fence
THATS the one good test of a real good fence
fencing over the rough places and knolls. And
Adrian Fences do it perfectly.
Adrian Fences are made of hih carbon spring steel
wire, pliable and extra strong. The tension curves are
long and easy no harder to put up Adrian Fences
over the hills than on the level ground. Always rigid
extreme cold and heat can't affect them the tension
curves take care of the expansion and contraction.
Put up Adrian Fcncrst, and you can quit worrying about fence
repairs There won't be any with Adrian Fences.
Come in and see for yourself just how good they really are;
we're always slad to unow them. Adrian Fence ia made by t

One of Best Ever Given by
Local Schools Pleased
Packed House Last Fri
day Night.
Last Friday evening, March 10 the
public was given a rare treat in the en
tertjiinment given at the opera house by
the grades of our school. The house
was crowded to the extent that even
standing room was al a premium. Dot
ing papas and mamas and all tbe rest of
the proud family were there, and wbe.i
they went home after the performance
all felt a hundred per cent prouder of
our school and bright boys and girls
that constitute tbe same.
The evening's entertainment was
opened by a band conoert given by tbe
high school band in full uniform, each
playir.g his level best. One woman was
heard to remark, "What a lot of fine
looking young Americans." The boys
never played better and tbe concert was
much enjoyed and greatly applauded by
the large audience. Prof. Patty cer
tainly deserves great credit for the re
markable progress the band is making
under bis leadership.
The concert was followed by a chorus,
"Out of the Deep," by the high school
Glee Club. This too, was much appre
ciated The Girls' Glee Cluboame next
with their song, "The Dancers."
Tbe little tots from tbe kindergarten
now took tbe platform and entertainer
the crowd to their greatest satisfaction
with a well executed folk dance. Tbe
little folks are always sure to please and
of course did not. fail this time.
The members of the first grade now
app arcd in the stately minuet, all in
costume of colonial times. George and
VSartba Washington, tbe much loved
Lsfayette and all the rest of tbe celeb
rities ot ye olden d vs were there to
make tbe dance tbe great success that
it proved to be.
The fl ig drill given by the second
grade was another good number. The
time and step of those taking part in
this drill was indeed what we might say
tr letter p rfct. They were highly
upplau I d and gru'itiy enj jyedoy all.
The Highland Fug whs danced by
the )oung ladies i f the third grade in a
manner that would mak9 Mrs Vernon
Castle green with envy. They were in
the dress of tbe Scotch lassie and were
very much admired. This dance was
901 of the best on mbers on the program
and the oung ladies were obliged to re
spond to an encore The music, in tbe
ntttureof a solo, was sung by Master
Theodore Eckert of the third grade.
He has an exceptiunalty fine voice and
for one so ou ng was a m trvel to all.
We predict for this little musician a
most remarkable career in his later
years.
The drama, "Che Brownie of Bled
nock," also given by the entire member
ship of the third grade, was another
tine addition to the evening's perfor
mance. The several parts were well
taken and the youngsters proved a
great credit to their instructor, Miss
Busley. This closed the first pait and
an intermission wns taken for a few
moments, after which the members of
the fourth, fifth and sixth grades pre
sented the playette, " ! be Qoeen of
Hearts " This too, was unusually well
given and met with much favor. Next
followed tbe Folk dance, given by tbe
memb rs of tbe snue grades. Of course
this whs good too.
The dia matiz'ition, "Miles Standisb,"
was given with Mi-s Dorothy Anderson
as Priscilla, Master Clifford Ballard as
John Alden and Koger Cole as Miles
Standisb. This was given with the ngbl
spirit and each young actor proved tbe
right one for the respective part.
Miss Marie Hanson then told tbe au
dience of the experiences of Josiah Al
len's wife while in a down town store.
This young lady did herself credit in
memorizing so length) a production ar.d
she also recited it veil.
The to songs, "The Violet and the
Bee" and Mtha Snofl ikes," by tbe
grades closed one of, if not the finest,
programs and evening's entertainments
that we bhve had in many a day. All
who took pirt rfl'C.ed much credit
on the school and the efficient corps of
teachers. Great credit is given our mu
sic teacher, Miss Williams, for the fine
musical numbers. It wag a bouncing
success in every way ard netted the
school the neat little huiii of over $60.
