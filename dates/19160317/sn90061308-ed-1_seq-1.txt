THE $1,000.00
PRIZE
Offered by this bank last week, to the person de
positing one cent in the bank and doubling the
amount each day for 30 consecutive days, is still
open, but no one has availed themselves of the of
fer, for on figuring the amount found, it would
take $14,928,720.07 to win the prize; however, thia
only shows how quickly an account can grow, and
if you can't double the amount each day, we will
appreciate your deposit anyway, no matter how
small, and a few dollars added each month will
soon surprise you to see how it grows.

GENERAL PERSHING BE
GINS PURSUIT OF VILLA
Smaller Force Enter Mexico
Columbus , '
Near
San Antonio, Tex., March 15.
General John J. Pershing, with more
than 4,000 troops, began the pursuit
in Mexico today of Francisco Villa,
whose raid across the border last week
caused President Wilson and his cab
inet to decide to use the United States
army to run him down. General Per
shing's report that he and his com
mand had crossed the international
boundary line just south of Columbus
reached General Frederick Funston, in
charge of general operations here, late
today. Reports of progress in the
country where the search has been be-
gun will be made by General Pershing
to General Funston, but it is not anti
cipated that these will be frequent or
deal with any but the more important
developments. f
How far into Mexico the column
had reached tonight was unknown here
nor did General Funston appear great
ly concerned. General Pershing's
course for the next two days is known
at headquarters and not until after
Friday are sharp developments ex
pected. Colonel George J. Dodd,
heading a smaller column that entered
Mexico some distance west of Colum
bus, also is moving in & southerly di
rection, and these two forces should
be within touch of each other before
the end of the week. By that time it
is expected an infantry support will
hold the lines of communication along
which motor trucks for the transport
tation of ammunition and suplies will
be operated. Although the censorship
Don't Know Us Come in and Get Acquainted
GALLOWAY CLOTHING COMPANY;
imposed by General Funston was re
laxed tonight, efforts still were made
to keep secret the details of the plan
of campaign, the exact number of men
engaged and their actual locations.
