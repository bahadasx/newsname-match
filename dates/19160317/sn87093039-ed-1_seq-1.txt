COLVILLE RESERVATION
TO BE OPENED SOON
Unrivaled Fruit, Grain and Mining Possi
bilities—No Better Watered
Section in the World
The announced determination o!
Washington's representative! in con
gress, printed in the daily press this
week, to make a determined effort to
have the Colville Indian reservation
opened to settlement at an early date,
possesses unusual interest for the thou
sands of people who have had an eye
on thi* last large body of valuable land
to be opened to settlement. It will be
recalled how some years ago a popu
lous state was created over night when
the Indian territory was thrown open to
•ettlement. A rush something akin to
that will occur when the Colville reser
vation is opened. The following de
scription of the Colville reservation by
the editor of the San Poil Eagle, who
Jives there and knows the country, will
help to give the reader an idea of the
country if he harbors a desire to go
there:
"For the benefit of those living far
away from this reservation, and to save
the time of answering so many individ
ual letten, we beg to say the Colville
Reservation from east to west is 65
miles and from north to south is 45
miles and it contains about 1,300,000
acres. A considerable portion of it is
quite mountainous. It contains very
fertile valleys and bench lands. Its val
leys are well watered with pure, clear
mountain streams and it is blessed with
thousands of pure springs. Within the
townsite of Keller there are no less
than seven everflowing springs. Like
other mountain countries in this lati
tude, in the northwest, it enjoys a mild
climate; the summer days are not ex
cessively warm and the nights are
always cool. A more healthful climate
cannot be found in any other part of
the world.
"Probably no inland section of any
country in America of corresponding
size can boast of so great a navigable
water frontage as this reservation. Na
ture in all her glory never entwined the
arms of ber water courses more beauti
fully around so great a section of God's
domain than she did around the Col
ville Reservation. On all its southern
and eastern borders it is washed by the
Columbia, one of the largest and great
est navigable rivers on earth. The
reservation frontage on the Columbia
river is more than ISO miles in length.
On the west side comes down the Oka
nogan river from Osoyoos lake in British
Columbia and adds another fifty miles
of navigable river frontage to the reser
vation.
"Then comes the charm of all—the
glory of the Nirarods and the Mecca of
the outing parties —the beautiful San
Poil river which crosses the entire res
ervation from north to south. It is not
only well supplied with game fish, but
it is one of the great spawning streams
of the Pacific coast salmon which swim
by the thousands 629 miles up the
Colombia to propagate their kind with
in its crystal waters. Besides the San
Poil there is the charming Nespelem
river and about fifty other small streams
all flowing either into the Columbia or
Okanogan rivers. In addition to its
streams and springs, the reservation
has many beautiful lakes of pure, clear
water and some so highly medicated as
to insure the new settlers with natural
health resorts unsurpassed anywhere on
the American continent.
A considerable portion of the moun
tain sections of this reservation has
been »et aside by the government as
mineral lands and subject to entry only
under the mineral laws.
"To the prospective settler who ex
pects to cultivate the soil or engage in
fruit growing or gardening or the rais
ing of stock or poultry, this mineral
land with iti bonanza ore bodies already
opened, should add greatly to his en
couragement. It i* a recognized fact
that mining always supplies a ready
market for all kinds of farm, rtock,
Uhc Xeavenwortb ißc^o
dairy and poultry products. That mil
lions will be spent developing the min
eral resources of this reservation is fully
conceded. Most of the great mining
camps of the west are so far remote
from soil products that nearly all the
food supplies have to be shipped in to
the mining centers.
"But on this reservation a large con
tribution to mining markets may be
made from adjacent farms, gardens,
orchards and stock ranges. Among all
experienced homeseekers desiring land
the mineral resources of the reservation
will certainly afford a great inducement.
"There are other natural mineral pro
ducts which should lend encourage
ment to the homestead settlement of
this reservation. Here fine brick and
other clay products may be made; here
are great lime and cement stone and
here is one of the greatest and best
granite deposits in America.
"Even if much of the soil is quite
abrupt and undulating, those disadvan
tages are more than counterbalanced
by other compensating benefits. Hun
dreds of other encouraging opportuni
ties could be truthfully offered the
prospective settlers, but our advice is
to come and see it for yourselves.
LOWER VAILEY HOOD
DAMAGE NOT SERIOUS
Wenatchee River Fell Two Feet Monday
to Wednesday—Slight Damage
at Some Points
The higher temperature of the past
two weeks has caused flood stages in
all the creeks that lead into the We
natchee river between Leavenworth and
Wenatchee. Up to Monday the We
natchee river had risen about ten feet
above the low water stage of February.
From Monday noon to Wednesday
morning, on account of the cool
weather, there was a fall of almost two
feet.
Cashmere, on account of its exposed
condition, had some apprehensions of
damage from the Wenatchee, but now
this is believed to be over unless a
prolonged warm period should follow.
Mission creek did some damage to
orchard lands in the vicinity of Cash
mere, but this is believed to have
passed the worst danger period and the
loss to orchards is not heavy, tho slight
damage to lands under Mission and
other creeks near Cashmere has already
resulted.
Orchards in the vicinity of Wena'chee
have suffered more from high water
coming out of the canyons south of
that town, where considerable damage
has resulted. The World of Tuesday
states that by hard work and the use of
three thousand bags of sand and gravel
to confine streams within channels the
loss has been considerably lessened and
the danger period has passed.
IMPORTANT HEALTH NOTICE
Don't Throw Garbage on the Snow
All persons are urged not to throw
garbage on the melting snow, as it will
be several weeks before the refuse can
be cleaned up and hauled away, and
in the mean time the garbage soaked
in water and exposed to the sun will
create an unhealthy and dangerously
unsanitary condition. Burn the gar
bage. Clean-up day will be several
weeks later this season than usual and
every precaution must be taken to pro
tect the health of the city under the
adverse circumstances.
Dr. J. S. Judah.
11 City Health Physician.
[rain Service on the 6. N.
Something approximating normal
conditions once more prevails on the
railroads. Of course trains have been
behind time, from one cause and an
other. Mud slides and washouts have
recently caused more trouble than any
thing else. They have been of no
great consequence and caused no
trouble beyond delays. From now on
the public may confidently look for ira-
provement.

Leavenworth, Wash., Friday, March 17, 1916
TWO MEETINGS ARE
HELD BY CITY COUNCIL
Seaman & Quigg Suit was the Principal
Matter Uuder Discussion at
Both Meetings
Five members of the city council
appealed on the scene Tuesday even
ing to attend to the city's business af
fairs, Featherstone, Hale, Kugelman,
Miller and Seeley Mayor Day, Clerk
Brown and Attorney Nelson were also
on hand.
Minutes of previous meeting were
read and approved and bills were al
lowed amounting to $334.00.
A communication was received from
Crollard & Crollard in which they stated
they were not in a position to take up
the city's suit against Seaman & Quigg
as they were now employed by that
firm in a legal capacity.
Kemp & Baker, of Wenatchee, in a
letter to Clerk Brown, stated that they
would go over the records in the case
and render an opinion on the advisa
bility of bringing suit for a fee of f 25.
Mr. Barrows, of Cade & Barrows, We
natchee, appeared personally for that
firm and made the following proposal:
He agreed to institute a suit provided
that he found by an examination of the
records that the city had a reasonable
chance of winning. The city is to pay
his firm $250 on signing of contract;
$250 on filing papers in the suit and
20 per cent of amount of judgement
obtained..
The proposition was placed on rec
ord for future reference.
The building committee repoited
that they had condemned the building
just west of the State Bank which was
recently damaged by snow.
Police Judge Graham sent in his res
ignation, which was tabled, and an
effort will be made to have him retain
the office.
The bootlegging ordinance was read
for the third time and signed by the
Mayor. It will be in operation five
days after its publication.
An ordinance was read which fixes a
salary of $25 a month for police judge
instead of a fee.
A report from Fire Chief Daly shows
that the fire equipment is in good
shape and that the department had re
sponded to one alarm of fire, the resi
dence of Chas. Lillegreen, Feb. 28.
In addition to the chief the department
consists of the follewing members,

Mr. Whitney agreed to prosecute the
case for an advance retainer of $500;
50 per cent of the first $2000 of any
judgment allowed, aud 10 per cent of
any amount over this sum. The prop
osition met with favorable considera-
tion and Mr. Whitney will probably be
retained as attorney in the muchly dis
cussed suit against Seaman & Quigg.

INVASION Of MEXICO
BEGAN YESTERDAY
Fifteen Thousand Infantry, Cavalry and
Artillery in Command of Gen.
Perching to Catch Villa
According to the best available in
formation the actual invasion of Mexican
territory began yesterday. Our govern
ment has given the Mexicans the same
privilege in the United States in the
hunt for Villa. Ever since the policy
of capturing the murderer was decided
on, the day after the Columbus massa
cre, all the available troops in the coun
try have been called to the Mexican
border. For the first time in this coun
try motor trucks will be used to traLS
port sapples and forage to the troops
in the field. Absolute secrecy about
the plans of attack are maintained, tho
it is believed three columns will enter
Mexico from as many different angles,
in the hope of taking Villa fore and aft.
An areo squad has been attached to
the army invadiDg Mexico. American
Consul Williams, stationed at Torreon,
Mexico, says the dispatches of Wed
nesday, turned his affairs over to the
British vice-consul and departed for
home. Perhaps the atmosphere be
came torrid at Torreon. Perhaps he
lacked sand. The dispatches do not
make clear why he left.
The order has gone out from Wash
ington to add 20,000 soldiers to the
army. It lacks this number of having
its full complement.

S. P. BETHEL DIED
MONDAY AFTERNOON
Prominent Fruit Grower in Upper Val
ley—Came Here in 1899
From Missouri
S. P. Bethel, who died Monday at 2
p. m., was a victim of cancer. The
disease made its first appearance over a
year ago on his foot. Up to a few
months ago he managed to attend to
his affairs. Since last fall the disease
spread rapidly and recently reached his
stomach, which was the immediate
cause of death.
Mr. Bethel was born Dec. 22, 1861,
and was in his 64th year when he died.
He leaves besides his wife, three chil
dren —Orville, who is with the family,
Mrs. James Miller, residing with her
husband at Bend, Oregon, and Burness,
aged five years.
He owned a fruit ranch about a mile
east of town, and was employed to over
see the 35-acre apple orchard owned
by the late Capt. McFarland, J. B.
Best and other Everett parties.
Funeral services were conducted at
the home Tuesday and the body taken
to Cashmere in the afternoon for burial.
Among those who accompanied the
body were Charles Fox, J. I. Brownlow,
J. L. Maston, Frank Varo, Wm. Doug
las and Otis Elam, who acted as pall
bearers; Mrs. C. M. Hendricks, sister
of Mrs. Bethel, Mr. and Mrs. J. S.
Smith of Peshastin and Mr. and Mrs.
D. C. Town.
Mr. Bethel was converted and joined
the Christian church in Missouri when
about twenty years of age, and for
years was an earnest, working Chris
tian. He was a great sufferer but
bore it all with Christian patience, and
his last days were full of peace.
Addressed the Peshastin Fruit
Growers
J. B. Adams went to Peshastin last
Saturday and made a two hours talk to
the fruit growers of that district. A
large number of growers were present
and took great interest. The Grow
ers' League, of which Mr. Adams is
the head sold nearly all its members'
apples the past year for cash at fairly
satisfactory prices. Since the cash
method of marketing apples has been
under discussion the past two weeks it
developed that this method would be
quite generally followed the coming
year. It was the methods of the
league and the past years' experience
that Mr. Adams told the Peshastin
growers about. It was just what they
wanted to hear. So favorably im
pressed were they with the leagues's
methods that they sent two delegates
to the meeting of the representatives
of the units that go to make up the or
ganization, which was called to meet at
Wenatchee Tuesday. G. A. Stage
and G. P. Freiberger were the dele
gates. The Peshastin fruit men will
in the future co-operate with the
Growers' League.
New Steel Between Here and
Wenatchee
Agent Woodrow said one day this
week that steel rails are coming in and
will be used in relaying the track be
tween Leavenworth and Wenatchee.
The work will begin at an early date.
The railroad company contemplates
making many improvements in this vi
cinity the coming summer.
C. E. Ordish, who had the contract
to fill the Great Northern icehouse,
said yesterday that he had completed
putting away ovei 500 tons of ice. He
said the ice costs the company in
round figures $1.50 per ton to put in
the house and it charges the shippers,
who use most of the ice. 17.50 per
ton.
J. W. Gordon, an old-time exponent
of the art preservative, owner of a
homestead in the Wenatchee lake re
gion, and sometimes employed on the
i Echo, returned from the coast country
' Sunday after an absence of two months.

$1.50 Per Year
Water on Quincy Lands from Columbia
River
A project backed by Spokane par
ties is now being promoted to water
the Quincy valley arid lands from the
Columbia river by pumping water
from the river. A large pumping
plant is to be installed at or near the
Rock Island rapids. The expense is
estimated at 118,000,000. A dam
will be built and a hydro-electric power
plant will furnish the power to operate
the pumps. This is the same project
that a few years ago was to be watered
from Wenatchee lake. The Wenaf
chee lake project has not been entirely
abandoned. Another company has un
der consideration the building of the
dam at Lake Wenatchee which pro
ject not only embraces watering the
Quincy lands but the development of
electric power for commercial purposes.
BOGUS CHECK ARTIST
WORKS HIS GAME HERE
Parolled From the Monroe Reformatory
Where He Was Sent for the
Same Offense
An Italian who gave the name of R.
F. Valentino, passed three or four bo
gus checks on several Leavenworth
business men last Tuesday and then
skipped out on a night train. He
was sent here by Superintendent Webb
of the Monroe Reformatory, about a
month ago, to work for the big mill
company. In accordance with the
custom of the reformatory officers the
L.-D. mill company had in the past
year been frequently importuned to
give employment to parolled prisoners
in the hope of again setting them on
the way of earning an honest living.
Mr. Gardner some time during the
winter had written the reformatory that
he could give employment to a painter.
Valentino was subject to parole and
claimed to be a painter, so they sent
him here, but on account of the delay
in train service he did not arrive until
after all the painting the company
wanted was done by a local painter.
Mr. Gardner kindly told the fellow he
would try and help him out, but soon
found out he was unreliable and no
painter. He did a little work around
town, ran a few bills on the strength of
painting jobs he claimed to have on
hand. His appearance and actions
were against him and he got little or
no work. Last Tuesday he passed a
$24.50 check on the proprietor of the
Rainier Cafe in payment of a small bill,
taking the change in cash. He also
passed a $3 check on the Club pool
room, and it is said he passed several
other small checks on other parties,
and left on the night train supposedly
for Spokane. Complaint was made
against Valenteno the following day
and the Monroe reformatory notified of
his tricks. He will in all liklihood be
arrested and returned to this place to
stand charges for obtaining money by
fraudulent means. The Monroe records
show that he was sent to that place for
passing bad checks.
Machinist Has Leg Broken
G. N. Machinist John Hazen had
the misfortune o< letting a heavy piece
of casting fall on his leg last Tuesday,
with the result that his leg was broken
just above the ankle joint. Dr. Hox
sey reduced the fracture.
The Maurer Sisters' Concert
A full house greated the four sisters
at their recital last Saturday evening in
the Scenic Theatre. This was gener
ally voted the best of the three per
formances introduced to the people of
Leavenworth the past winter under the
guarantee of the ladies of the Kumtux
; club. That the audience was highly
pleased was made evident by the re
calls.
Mr. W. F. Whimey of Wenatchee,
j one of the leading attorneys of the
, county seat town, was here Wednesday
|on legal business and found time to
call on The Echo and leave his profes
sional card for insertion in future issues
' of this paper.
