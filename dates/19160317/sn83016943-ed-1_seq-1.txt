MACON BEACON
67th YEAR
MACON, MISSISSIPPI FRIDAY, MARCH 17. 1916.
BRICKBATS FOR JIM
In former years it was quite
popular to say that this paper
was quite unkind in its criticisms
of Senator Vardaman, says the
Jackson News. Perhaps we were,
but the Daily News never parted
from the truth in dealing with
our junior Senator, and the un
kind things we may have said in
the past are mild indeed when
compared with the things now
being said by other newspapers. ,
Here is an example from yester
day's issue of the Birmingham
News, a paper that was much
pleased when Vardaman was
elected to the Senate five years
ago:
Vardaman is a queer cuss. He
seems hardly to know what he
means himself; as if he were
feeling his way, on unsafe
ground, as indeed he is.
Thursday he attacked Congress
for being as sheep, for being led
as lambs to a sacrifice of princi
ples. "Iam willing," he said,
"to concede the President thinks
he is vested with the power he
arrogates to himself, but I am
unwilling to delegate to the Pres
ident or to anyone else the right
to perform a duty for me which
means so much to the American
people as the subject under con
sideration (armed ships.) . The
President has written some good
books, but I do not think he has
a corner on all the wisdom of the
universe, nor is he more patriotic
than the Congress which shares
with him the responsibilities of
the government."
No, the President has no cor
ner on all the wisdom, and none
knows that better than he. His
hair may not be so long as the
Mississippi Senator's, his voice
may not have the shouting quali
ty of the gentleman from Mis
sissippi, and his patriotism may
not be greater than his. nor his
brains bulge bigger, but ; he - has
: B nappy KUac&ux uauiM uiauie
and patriotism in a sort of team
play that gets things done, sensi
bly and wisely. That is a result
which the Senator from Missis
sippi has never been able to
achieve.
And here is another brickbat
hurled from the editorial sanc
tum of the St. Louis Star:
Senator Vardaman says the
country is going to the dogs be
cause President Wilson is domi-
natincr Congress. It is not a far
rrv to the time when Mississippi
was on the road to the dogs when
Vardaman was dominating it.
C. G. Petere Dead
The Yellow Streak.
Swiftly succeeding events may
soon obscure in our memories
the congressional demonstration
aeainst the President on a cnti
cal question of foreign policy last
week; and, on that account, it
may be the more necessary to
record the present impression
that the most alarming feature
of the "xevolt" was the disclos
ure of a structural weakness of
the Democratic party for respon
sible government in times like
these.
The President's grip wasevi
AontW not loosened. . Yet
serious damage to the Demo
cratic party has been done. It
has again exhibited the tradi
tional incoherence. The yellow
streak in it for a moment was
made as conspicuous as the rays
of a searchlight piercing dark
ness. The country seemed to be
again reminded that of the wild
asses of the political desert the
Democratic party still had more
than a normal allowance. There
was even threatened, apparently,
another pitiable party disruption
such as shattered the second ad
ministration of Mr, Cleveland.
In the same degree that the
Democrats of congress displayed
and hvstena Repub
licans displayed steadiness and
discipline. Senator Lodge's quick
avowal of uncompromising sup
.f nf the Democratic President
was the finest political stroke for
the Republican parcy one maw
served in many a year, -Springfield
Republican,
Saturday night, March 11, 1916,
while driving home from Macon, Mr.
C. R. Peters was stricken with what is
generally termed heart failure and
died very suddenly. A greater shock
could not have come to the people of
Mashulaville and surrounding country.
Mr. Peters left his room at the Agri
cultural High School about 6 o'clock
Saturday afternoon and drove out to
Macon to attend to personal matters of
business.
While in Macon he suffered a slight
attack of rapid beating of the heart
He had never suffered such trouble be
fore, and, believing himself to be abso
lutely well and strong, gave no serious
thought to his trouble.
While driving home during the night
with his brotner, Frank Peters, he
suffered a second attack, which proyed
fatal.
In attempting to eulogize this noble
young man I feel an unfitness to do
justice to his life because of the inad
equacy of my word to express my
thoughts. However, if intimate asso
ciation reveals man to man, then I am
ideally qualified to speak, in my own
way, of his life character and ambi
tions.
A cleaner, purer life has never been
spent by a man of twenty-two years.
I was in position to know his every
thought and see his every action, and
his conversation was always of the
nature of that common in the most re
fined of society. Asa friend, he was
noble and sincere; as a companion,
honest and true; as a christian, devout,
always ready to serve, and as a citi
zen, a leader, a thinker ana a Denever
in justice to his fellowman.
The character of Glenn Peters will
be felt in the life of young and old
alike in this section. He was a teacher
of young men and young women in the
Sunday school. Here he planted seed
that will bring forth fruit in season.
He held a position of honor and re
sponsibility in the Agricultural High
School, that of Professor of Agriculture
and Director of Extension Work. On
the school campus he was a living ex
ample to the young men of what can
be done with an opportunity. He was
thoroughly interested in bis extension
work arid woul&Hpend days away from
his school work out among farmeas of
this section, advising them about their
crops, stock and orchards.
The school, the community and his
many friends everwhere feel a great
loss, but our loss is his gain, for his
ambition and motto was:
"So live that when thy summons comes
to join
Tne innumerable caravan which moves
To that mysterious realm where each
shall take
His chamber in the silent halls of death,
Thou go not, like the quarry slave at
night,
Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustain
ed and soothed
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy
grave
Like one who wraps the drapery of his
couch
About him and lies down to pleasant
dreams."
No greater consolation can we get in
our grief for our friend than that
"The light of smiles shall fill again
The lids that overflow with tears
And wearv hours of woe and pain,
Are promises of happier years.
His Roommate,
Want Equalization Schoot Fund.
. Members of the State Legisla
ture, particularly of the Senate,
have become very resolute in the
effort to have a readjustment or
fair equalization of the public
school funds of the State, ac
cording to gossip around the cap
itol. A bill has already been in
troduced with this object in view,
and opposition to it has brought
about some maneuvering that
will very likely cause the oppo
nents to come to terms-
Senators John A. Clarke, of
DeKalb. and E. S. Richardson,
of Philadelphia, are among those
who are putting up a determined
fight for the equalization. They
have even gone so far as to serve
notice on some of their colleagues
that unless they "come across"
a fight for a constitutional con
vention will be waged and won.
The idea of a constitutional
convention is a scare that makes
some of the members of the
present legislature shiver, and it
is said that these gentlemen are
beginning to sit up and take se
rious notice of the situation.
Senator Richardson has been
the champion of the public schools
all through the present session,
and there appears to be sufficient
strenerth on his side to force
some sort of adjustment of the
school distribution controversy,

Preparednt.
The best exemplification of pre
paredness that we know of is the
farmer. Ilia entire life is devoted
to preparedness in some form. He
prepares to feed his stock in the
winter by raising corn and har
vesting hay in the summer; he
prepares to feed his family by
raising pigs and poultry and stor
ing away peas and potatoes; he
hauls his firewood in the summer
to have it connenient for use in
the winter; he grows cotton to be
prepared to meet his obligations.
His life's endeavor to be prepared
for any eventuality. The thrifty
and provident man in other voca
tions docs the same things he
lives in a condition of prepared
ness. It is only when the individ
ual is unprepared that he suffers.
The farmer may never face pov
erty, the provident man may
never face want, but it is noticed
that they never assume any risks
and never relax in an effort to
provide for the pjoverbial rainy
day and against the adversary of
old age.
We are told in the Good Book
that one must prepare to meet
death about the only instence of
preparedness that is generally dis
regarded. If it is a good thing for the
farmer and the artisan, the state
and the municipality, to live in a
state of preparedness, why should
it not be a good thing for the na
tion! The state has its sheriffs
and constables, the municipali
ties their marshals to preserve
the peace and protect property
rights of the individual against
ihe criminally inclined, why then
should not the nation be ade
quately prepared to defend itself
against the covetous desires of ri
val nations! A nation is a big
aggregation of individual units,
swayed in its last analysis by the
same human nature that sways
the individual, and we all know
that selfishness and greed arc the
dominating factors in human con
duct. To our mind, the lack of ade
quate preparedness for defense
would be a crime against the very
existence of the nation. Crystal

The Fragrance of Content.
The most fortunate being on
earth, who has friends and wealth
and auiet and a good digestion.
tan find plenty of sources of
trouble if he hunts for them,
says an exchange. In the words
of the cynical French writer,
"A man who has ten needs is not
happy when nine of them are
satisfied." That is perfectly
true, and not even nine of them
ever are satisfied. The secret is
to learn to fix your thoughts on
the satisfied ones, and not be for
ever brooding on the reluctant
shadow of that unattainable
tenth.
There is, indeed, a fatuous
optimism that disgusts. People
who are always laboriously turn
ing up the little silver lining of
big black clouds are wearisome,
especially when the black clouds
are not theirs, but yours. Also,
it may well be urged that discon
tent is the root of all great ac
complishment. Pe r s o n s who
easily find good in everything
and who seem to be always liv
ing in sunshine are not too like
ly to bestir themselves to better
their own lot or that of others.
Probably the ideal temperament
would be that suggested by
Charles Lamb, with his usual
whimsical charm: ''Contented
with little, yet wishing for
more."
The value of a quiet, content
ed spirit, however, reaches far
beyond itself. We live in an age
of struggle and restlessness.
Perhaps that is true of all ages,
but it seems especially true of
our hurrying, eager, ambitious,
unsettled American democracy.
