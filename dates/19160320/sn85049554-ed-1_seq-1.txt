Berlin, via London, March 20.—The
resignation of Grand Admiral-von Tlr

of Its bearing on the submarine cam

by the turn which the controversy over
his withdrawal Is now taking.
The parliamentary opposition makes
more certain than ever what the rep
resentative of the Associated Press was
able to state from the most authorita
tive source upon the day the admiral
retired, that a change in the ministry
will not involve the abandonment or
modification of the submarine cam
paign against commerce nor a weak
ening of a campaign in which all ships,
neutral or enemy, playing to and from
England, would be subject to attack.
This Idea of an unlimited torpedo
campaign for which Count von Revent

for weeks, was being used, it is de
