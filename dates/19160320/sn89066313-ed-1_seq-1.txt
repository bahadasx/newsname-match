Take In Columbia.
There is possibility of the proposed
new route of the Seattle-to-Savannah
Highway running through Columbia,
according to C. O. I lanes, secretary of
the Commercial Club. Mr. Danes re
centl wrote to the Seattle Chamber
or Commerce to investigate.
The highway will be organized at a
convention to be held in Omaha April
24 and 23. The proposed route of the
highway is Seattle to Spokane. Wash.;
Livingston and Butte, Mont.; Cody,
Wo.; Deadwood, Mitchell, Bell
Fourch anef Sioux Falls, S. D.; Sioux
City, la.; Omaha, Neb.; Atchison,
Kan.; St. Louis, Mo.; Memphis, Tenn.;
Decatur, Ala., and Atlanta and Savan

The convention in Omaha will be
merel to decide upon the pivotal
points and not the route between an
two of these points. For instance, the
route between Kansas City and St.
Louis will not be definitely determined
at this convention, but will be left for
decision to a district convention to be
held in Kansas City or St. Louis.

$2,085.75 Gross Receipts of
Missouri-Kansas Dual Clash

The growing magnitude of the an
nual Missouri-Kansas dual meet Is
shown in the statement of Athletic
Director C. L. Brewer today that the
gross receipts of the thirteenth annual
meet, held last Friday night, were $-.-08575.
Last car the receipts were
only $1,700.
The annual contest was not a pay
ing proposition until five years ago,
but each year since then the meet
has grown in popularity and with the
removing of the gridiron classic, it is
Kansas Cit's big chance to see the
rival institutions clash for athletic
honors.

received $695 25 of this ear's receipts.
The total expenses of both .Missouri
and Kansas amounted to $477.90, leav
ing a net profit of $912.G0, which is

LIEUT, KING ORDERED
INTO ACTIVE SERVICE
Officer Appointed to Come
Here Is Believed to Be
With Dodd's Cavalry.
WIFE SENDS WORD
Columbian, Captain Smoke,
Sent to Fort Russell Fam
ily to Join Him There.
President A. Boss Hill received a
letter from Mrs. Joseph C. King, writ
ten in El Paso, stating that her hus
band, first lieutenant of the Seventh
Cavalry, who was recentl appointed
to take the place of Charles Mcli. Eby
as commandant of cadets in the Uni
versity, had been ordered "into the
field."
Mrs. King did not say where her
husband was. Lieutenant King was to
have been in Columbia by March 18.
It is thought lere that he is with
the troops commanded by Colonel
George A. Dodd in pursuit of Villa.
Captain Samuel Smoke, retired ar
my officer, whose home is here, now
supervisor of the state militia of Cali
fornia, sent word today to his famil
here that he ha sbeen ordered to Fort
Russell in Cheenne, Wo, to act as
quartermaster in the place of the ac
tive quartermaster, who has left for
the Mexican border. The family, con
sisting of Mrs. Smoke and Samuel
Smoke, Jr., will leave for Fort Russell
as soon as their household goods are
packed.
"The calling of Captain Smoke into
active service may have a national sig
nificance," said Sergeant A. D. Thomp
son, retired non-commissioned offi
cer, who has charge of the University
armory here. "It may be a sign that
all retired army officers are to be
called back into service to take up
the work of the officers in the fort3
who have left or are preparing to
leave for the Mexican frontier."
Asked if he had received orders to
leave here, Sergeant Thompson said:
"Not et, but I vvill not be surprised
if orders come. I hope the do come,
for I have been here five ears, and
(hat is too long for any ami officer
to be in one place."
Sergeant Thompson added that he
thinks some retired army officer will
be sent here to act as commandant
of cadets in place of Lieutenant J. C.
King.
KAISER'S S0.S AKE NOT SPARED
Four Have Been Wounded at Front
Since Beginning of War.
Ity United Press.
AMSTERDAM, March 20. The
wounding of Prince Oscar of Germany
on the Russian front makes four of
the Kaiser's sons who have suffered
bodily injury in the war, according to
records here. Only the Crown Prince
and Prince Adalbert have escaped
thus far.
t August Wilhelm, the Kaiser's fourth
son, was wounded during the battle
of the Marne by a bullet in his left
arm. The second son, Eitel Freder
ick, was thrown from his horse in
October, 1914, and suffered a damaged
knee. Joachim, the sixth son, was
wounded by shrapnel in the right thigh
in September, 1914.
Joachin was also nearly captured
by the Russians in the following De
cember. He was rescued by a German
aeroplane. Oscar, recently wounded,
suffers from palpitation of the heart
and collapsed from this complaint
after a battle In 1914.

CQOLING-OFF PERIOD
WOULD AVERT WARS1
G. Lowes Dickinson De
clares Aggressor Is Hidden
by Hasty Clashes.
SEES U.S. IN THE LEAD
Says America May Be of
Unique Service as World
Peace Advocate.
A compulsory "cooling off" period
for nations before recourse to hostili
ties was proposed by G. Lowes Dick
inson in liis lecture on "International
Reconstruction After the War" in the
I'niversity Auditorium this afternoon
Mr. Dickinson is here under the
auspices of the World Peace Founda
tion. He is a fellow of Cambridge
University, England, and is visiting
America to lecture at universities on
proposals which have been put for
ward in various countries for interna
tional reconstruction after the war
with a view to diminishing the risk
of war in the future.
"The present war was possible be
cause it was rushed," said Mr. Dickin
son. "There was no time for consid-
.owes Dickinson
eration or foi tlie public opinion to
realize the situation. If there had been
time, I believe public opinion would
not have tolerated a European war."
Not only would a "cooling off" pe
riod diminish tlie risk of war, accord
ing to Mr. Dickinson, but there would
be no doubt as to the aggressor.
"Under present conditions when
war breaks out," explained Mr. Dick
inson, "there is never any clear agree
ment or test as to who is the real ag
gressor. In the present war each side
believes the other to have been the
aggressor and, conseqently, the war
is supported by public opinion in all
the belligerent countries."
That the plan would be practicable,
because the nations will have a radi
cal determination to avoid a repetition
of the catastrophe of war, was demon
strated by Mr. Dickinson by citing the
present conditions in Europe which
are likely to produce a tremendous re
action against war in the belligerent
countries. A similar plan has recently-
been advocated by the French Social
ists, the Central Organization for a
Durable Peace, established in 1914 at
the Hague, and the neutral European
countries.
To America belongs the lead, main
tains Mr. Dickinson. He thinks Ameri
ca can no longer continue in isolation
and can serve civilization. If to arm is
necessary, by arming, not for aggres
sion or defense, but to guarantee and
safeguard the peace of the world.

EXPLUNS THE ITER Sill'
C. W.
.Martin Siis Itiiildlng Extends
Four Feet Too Far.
Explaining the suit that was filed
Friday in Circuit Court by C. W.
Martin, Ernest Martin and their sis
ter, Mrs. Florence Perkins, against
Elvira II. Stone. C. W. Martin said to
day that the Columbia Theater, owned
by .Mrs. Stone, extends four feet on to
their property.
The property was inherited by the
Martin brothers and their sister from
their brother, Herbert Martin, and they
believe tlie question was not raised
before because Herbert .Martin never
had the lot surveyed. According to
C. W. Martin. when the theater was
built there was no thought of its be
ing on his property, because it was
built on the exact site of the church
that was formerly there.
Mr. Martin sas that a recent survey
made the lot appear narrow. Accord
ing to him the deed of the lot calls
for CO feet front, whereas tlie front
now is only .10.
J. Dozler Stone, son of Mrs. Elvira
Stone, said the building only covers
the land in the deed and that a mis
take of that kind seems impossible.
The plaintiffs ask for $100 damages
and $20 a month rent from the time
of judgment.
