REPORTS SAY
United Pre»» Staff Correspondent
DOUGLAS, Ariz., March 20.—Rumors
that Francisco Villa had escaped the Ameri
can trap and was safe in the Sierra Madres,
east of Madera, are current today. It is
known that Gen. Gutierrez's scouts have lost
track of him.
Spread out like a fan, half a dozen
American detachments are combing the
country south and southeast of Casas
Grandes today. Gen. Pershing is making
his greatest effort on a southeasterly direc
tion. This is taken to indicate that Villa is
near Nuamiquipa or the Babricora ranch.

EL PASO, March 30.—Reported hemmed in among the
canyons of the «.uerrero mountains, Franci«co Villa is be
lieved to be surrounded today by several Carranzista column*
and the American expedition closing down on him fr<-m the
north.
Indications today point to a long pursuit of \ ilia far into
Mexico, an<l the problem of supplying the expedition with
food and munitions was uppermost in the minds of army men.
A few considered that withdrawal of the expedition with
out capturing Villa is likely a- an alternative to forcibly tak
ing Mexican railroads, defying Carranza. and possibly pre
cipitating intervention, with a year's bloody warfare against
all factions.
In view of President Wilsons pa*t favors to ( arranza,
aiding him to defeat Villa at Agua Prieta by transporting
de facto government troop* thru I'. S. territory from Kagle
Pass to Douglas, the desired permission to ship American
military supplies by rail and perhaps to send reinforcements
to (ieii Pershing over Mexican railroads, was expected.
