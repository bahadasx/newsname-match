The Rev. Pereival S. Snilthe paid
his monthly visit to Tonopah yesler
ay, occupying the pulpit at St. Mark's
Kplscopal church both morning and
evening, holy communion being ad
ministered at the former service. The
discourse delivered in the evening
dealt with the subject of a "Renewal
of the Mind." The sermon was re
plete with many practical points, the
contention made by the rector being,
that If we are successful In changing
our minds from evil to that which is
good, we have In all reality become
converted. The offertory solo, "1 Shall
See Him Face to Face," was beauti
fully rendered.
Mr. Snilthe took occasion to remark
that he will re-visit St. Mark's church
on Sunday, April Kith, both morning
and evening. He also stated it is
the intention of Bishop Hunting to
hold services in this church on Mon
day evening, April 17th, at 7:30, and
earnestly requested the members of
the congregation to advertise that
fact as much as possible In order to

SUPPLY OF WATER AT ROUND
MOUNTAIN WILL LAST ALL
THIS SEASON
Everything points to a most suc
cessful season for Round Mountain, is
the opinion of L. D. Gordon, the dis
coverer of the district and president
of the Round Mountain Mining com
pany. He is in Tonopah today after
having spent a week in the camp.
Mr. Gordon reports that the hy
draulic operations have been in pro
gress for the past ten days with
three shifts, electric lights being
strung to enable work to be carried on
at night. Owing to the heavy snow
fall. It seems likely that washing will
be continued without intermission un
til freezing weather conies again.
New developments are being carried
forward In the Sunnyside shaft of the
Round Mountain Mining company with
very gratifying results and the mill Is
running steadily.
Franklin and Murphy of New Jersey tsaid that Ellhu Root had stated posi
tively that he would not attend the convention. Previous to the (sessions,
Williams said that Oregon Republicans regarded Hughes as the best com
promise candidate. He said; "I do not believe the leaders regard Roosevelt
seriously as a candidate. Murphy brought the Root boom, who, he said was
an 'Ideal Candidate.'" He said: "The wisest leaders of the party seem to
think that Roosevelt could not be elected if nominated." Fred Upham, leader
of the Chicago convention committee, just from the east, said that sentiment
in the east placed Hughes first. Governor MeCall second, and Fairbanks
third, as possible candidates.

"This little trip of ours is for the

"We understand that there is a
splendid country back of Tonopah,
where there are heavy livestock Inter

opening up. That Is what you need.
It is to the Interest of every business
man In Tonopah to seek to develop

they can make a comfortable living
