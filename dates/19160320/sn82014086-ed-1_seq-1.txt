HOW BERLIN VIEWS
RESIGNATION CF VCN TIRPITZ
Regarded as a Result of International
Politics.
Berlin, Marc!; 19, 5.30 p. m., via
London. March 20, 3.43 a. m. The r;
ignation of Grand Admiral Von Tir-
pitz is to be regarded less in the light
of its bearing on the. submarine cam
paign than as an affair of interna
tional politics. Not the question of
how and to what extent the subma
rine weapon was to be used, but the
question of the homeogenity of the
German government is involved in the
resignation of the powerful states
man, who for almost twenty years
has ruled the German navy depart
ment with an autocratic sway and
has suffered no interference or super
vision from without.
This statement by a careful, well
posted observer of German politics
regarding the causes and results of
the retirement of Admiral Von Tir
pitz, is bbrne out' by the turn" which
the controversy over this withdrawal
is now taking.

AGITATION FOR MILK FOR
BABIES IN GERMANY.
Declared by Lord Robert Cecil to Be
Insincere.
London. March 19. 3.15 p. m. "The
agitation in America for the export of
rr.i'k to babies in Germany is the most
dishonest and insincere feature of the
propanga which Germans have con
ducted in your country," saiy Lord
Robert Cecil, the minister of war
trade, in discussing today with a
representative of The Associated
''ress the charge that the British
blockade was having a serious effect
upon the milk supply of the central
powers.
T.ord Robert Cvil said: "I have
been unable to find any evidence of
honesrty in the German claim that
their babies are suefrring for the lack
of milk. The wnole agitation is
wholly a political move, designed to
discredit us with philanthropic Amer
'cans.'

possible to completely stop this traf

Viila Has Been

BY
THE RAPID ADVANCE
AMERICAN TROOPS
OF
BANDITS ARE HEMMED IN
Carranza Troops On Three Sides and
the American Force is Driving in on
the Fourth Troops in Good Shape.
El Paso, Texas, March 19. Francis
co Villa has been driven into a trap
by the rapid advance of the American
troops, according to information re
ceived today in wireless despatches
from the front and in telegraphic des
patches to General Gabriel Gavira, the
Carranza commander at Juarez. Ev
erything seems now to depend on the
ability of the Carranza garrisons to
hold their end of the net. On thye
sides the bandit chief is hemmed in
by strong Carranza columns, while
on the fourth the Americans are driv
ing forward with amazing speed.
Villa at Babricora.
Villa was reported in the Rabricora
Lake region tonight in the ranch of
-Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, which he has
ravaged several times in the past.
Babricora is about 55 miles south of
Galena, where one section of the
American expeditionary force has ar
rived and is pushing forward at the
rate of 33 miles a day. A few miles
to the west of the bandit's position is
Xamiquipa, which is held by a pow
erful Carranza garrison. On the east
are the frowning barriers of the Sier
ra Mad re Mountains, barring the way
to Sonora, General Luis Gutierrez,
Carranza's firUl chief, declares that
he holds all the passes to Sonora.
Blocked by Carranza Garrison.
To the south. Villa's way is block
ed by tbv Carranza garrison at Ma
dera, a town of t-onsidei aide import
ance as the headquarters of the Ma
dera Compar.v, Ltd., an American con
cern which lias vast lumber, mining
and railroad interests .
'n account of the importance of
this town an exceptionally heavy Car
ranza force is said to hold it.
Problem of Bringing Up Supplies.
While Garrunza and his military
authorities have succeeded so far in
avoiding uny friction there is one se
rious question which mav .liise at anv
time to threaten the entire situation.
As the lines of communication of the
American force lengthen the problem
of bringing up supplies becomes in
creasinglv more pressing.

N'ew York, March 19. The confer
ence committee of managers for tht

here today -to the 30.0- o stockholders

demands of tho railroad trainmen for
vl "aes as unfair and added
that the carriers cannot and should
not shoulder this burden of an un
warranted Increase of 1 100.000.000 in
the wages of a small minority of their
highest paid employes."

"Considf ring the hi?h warps and
the favorable conditions en.loyed by
the trainmen as compared with other
railroad men and workers in other in
dustries, their demand for still high
er wages Is not a fair one. Xor is it
an honest statement to nut this de-
mand for hichcr wages 4n the form of
a rlr-a for an eight hour day.
