The measure was fought chiefly by
the west end delegates who argued
that two measures on the ballot with
fnetloni supporting each would tend

West End for Bonds.
The west end delegation stood sol
idly for the bonding measure and de
clared their section of the county
would give a majority to the measure.
The principal opposition to the' bond
ing measure came from those who fa
vor a hard surface road to Cold
Springs Landing for which the bond
ing program makes no provision.
As a sort of compromise between
the two factions a motion was made
at i ne time to raise money by bond
ing for the purpose of building hard
surface roads from Pendleton 'to
Cmatilla and from Pendleton to
Athena and on to Cold Springs
through Helix I'pon motion by Har
rah this plan was laid on the table.
Senator Barrett injected some feel

the bonding program was mapped out
by a bunch of hand-picked delegates.
Both Chairman Robinson and Asa B
Thomson, members of the original

to resent Barrett's statements, de
