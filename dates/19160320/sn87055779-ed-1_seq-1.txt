SENATE TO HUSH
" ARMTBILLVHTE
Senate Legislation is Side
tracked in Favor of Cham
berlain Measure.
ifiteruationnl News Service:
WASIUNOTOX, Mrch 20. With
all other legislation sidetracked and
the parliamentary right of way
cleared, the senate today prepared
to rush the Chamberlain army bill to
a vote at record-breaking speed. Al
though. there promises to be consid
erable debate on the measure, its
final passage is not doubted by lead
ers who have canva.ssod the senate's
stntiment on preparedness.
.Party lines have been frvvept away
completely on the defense issue. An
overwhelming majority of the re
publican senators will vote for the
Chamberlain bill. Thus far, the
only two voices lifted against the
incisure have boon Sen. Hitchock,
democrat of Nebraska, and Sen. Mc
Cumber of North Dakota. Both ex
pect to submit amendments.
The three centers of debate are
on tho plan to increa.se the regular
army to $254,000 men war strength,
the creation of a federal volunteer
army of 'GÜ,(Mif men. and the raising
of the national guard to L'Sij,O00
men. Whatever is finally decided by
the setuvto will have to be modified,
it is predicted, to conform to the
house measure and compromise the
widely different ideas of the two
bodies.
A more careful analysis of the
Chamberlain bill today revealed that
as a result of the agitation against
the inefficiency of the army aviation
corps, seven aero squadrons with
appr ximately 4 new aeroplanes
Me idovided.
The senate is scheduled to vote to
morrow afternoon on the Tillman
bill providing Jll.0o0.00i to build a
government armor plate factory. In
dications are that the bill will pass.
