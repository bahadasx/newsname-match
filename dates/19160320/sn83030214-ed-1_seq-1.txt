El Taso. Tex?, March l9.-*-Swep1 into ? trap by the swift,
advance of the American force?, Francisco Villa to-night is not
many hours away from death or surrender, if tin? Carranca

from General Pershing's column, received here to-night and in
Columbus, and by telegraphic advices t?> General Gavin, at
Juarez.
Everything seems non to depend on the ability of the Car?
ranza garrisons to hold their end of the net. On three sides
of the bandit chief ho is hemmed in bj strong Carranza columns,
while on the fourth the Americans are driving forward with
amazing speed.
