amounted to $24,821,408 as compared

Armor Plate Matter.
Calling attention to the bill pending
in congress for the building by the
government of an armour plant,
Messrs. Schwab and Grace declared
that.
"Recognising that though the in

Important obligation to the nation of
which it Is a citizen, your offioers have
appeared before the senate commit
tee on naval affairs and urged the de
feat of the pending measure. As it is
frankly declared that the sole pur
pose oi the proposed enterprise is that
.the government may secure its'armor
at a lower price, your officers have
submitted the following proposition to
the Federal government:
Offers Probe.
"We will agree to permit any well
known Arm of chartered public ac
countants to inventory our plant and
make careful estimates of the cost of
manufacture with that data in hand
we will meet with the secretary of the
navy and agree to manufacture armor
at a price which will be entirely satis
factory to the secretary of the navy as
being quite as low as the price at
which the government could possibly
manufacture armor on its own ac
count, after taking into account all
proper charges. As a concrete work
ing basis for such negotiations
Bethelehem Steel company has offer
ed to manufacture one-third of the
armor plate required for the con
templated Ave year naval program
(estimated at approximately 120,000
tons) for a price of $896 per ton for
side armor, as compared with the
price of $426 per ton now obtaining.
No Increase Made.
"It may be added that while all oth
er steel prices have greatly increased
the foregoing figure at which we now
offer to make armor- for the United
States is not only a lower price than
has been paid by the government for
more than ten years, but It is also a
substantially lower price than Is paid
for armor by Japan, Austria and
Germany, Prance or England."

Denial Matte by J. P. Mor
gan on'His Return From
Europe.
New York, March $0.—J. P. Mor
gan, head of the banking house of J.
P. Morgan & Co., who arrived here
today from Liverpool on the steamship
Philadelphia, reiterated the denial' re
cently issued from his office here that
a new credit against American securi
ties, said to have been mobilised in
London, had been arranged by him for
the entente allies.
He asserted that he knew of no new
loan to the allies being contemplated
now and asserted that the resources
created by the last loan were not ex
hausted, supporting his assertion by
reference to the steadiness of the ex
change market. As to the reported
mobilizing in London of American se
curities held in Great Britain and
Prance, Mr. Morgan said:
"I understand they expect to handle
these securities as they have been do
ing in the past, and they will be taken
care of in a way that will not hurt the
market."
The financier refused to discuss his
mission abroad or in what transactions
he had been engaged. He declined also
to talk of a second appearance as a
witness before the Thompson legisla
tive committee to testify regarding the
affairs of the Interborough Rapid
Transit company. "I know nothing
about it." he asserted.
Asked as to what impressions he
had gathered while in Europe as to
the progress of the war, he smilingly
said:
"I am not a military man hence I
cannot discuss that question. I did not
observe, however, any signs of weak
ening."
Mr. Morgan sailed from New Tork
on February 2 and it then was re
ported he had gone abroad in connec
tion with a new French loan. This re
port was denied by Octave Homburg
of the Anglo-French commission, the
government's financial representative
here. Later reports from abroad were
that his mission had to with Ameri
can securities.

Washington Government is
Making Efforts to Avoid
Rupture.
Washington, March 10.—General
Carranza has formally protested
against American troops occupying
Casas Grandes in their pursuit of Villa
and the American government has re
plied that the troops have been order
ed specifically not to occupy Oasas
Grandes or any other towns or cities
In Mexico.
Notes Exchanged.
The protest and reply were included
in the exchange of notes between Act
ing Secretary Polk of the state de
partment, and Hliso Arredondo, am
bassador designate to the United
States from Mexioo.
After the conferenoe between Sec
retary Polk and the president, it be
came known that Secretary Polk, in
a note forwarded to Mexioo yesterday
said Instructions had been sent to
General Punston to keep his troops
away from all the towns.
The state department had not re
ceived a reply from the request sent
to Oarransa for use of the Meld can
railroads la transporting supplies to
the expeditionary force* It sjm beea
pointed out to the Cairansa govern
ment that similar permissions was
granted to Carranza troops for use of
the railroads in the United States last
year.
Secretary Polk denied that the
United States troops proposed to take
over any railroads in Mexico or that
the request Is in any sense a demand
or ultimatum. The administration
realises fully the difficulty of Car
ranza's position because of the feeling
in Mexico. Btor that reason every
effort is being made by the state de
partment to disseminate In Mexico
information that the United States
has no motive of aggression in send
ing troops after Villa.

the eastern railroads, of which Elisha
Lee is chairman, In a statement Issued
here today, "to the 300,000 stock
holders of these companies," char
acterized the demands of the railway
trainmen for higher wagea as unfair,
and added that "the carriers cannot
and should not shoulder this burden
of an unwarranted increase of 100,
000,000 in the wages of a small minor
ity of their highest paid employes."
The payroll of the eastern roads in
1914. it was shown, amounted to
ISSt,000.000. of which 16.000,000
went to the trainmen.
"The 660,000 owners of the rail
roads, who have put $7,000,000,000
of their savings in the business, re
ceive on their Investment about
00,000,000 a year or four per eent,"
the statement continues. "The railroad
trainmen on every road in the country
are demanding an Increase in wages
that will add not far from 100,000,
000 to the payroll.
"These employes, the highest paid
in the. service, are less than one-flfth
of the army of railroad workers. They
have taken the cream of the big wage
advances of the past few years. If
they force their demands on the car
riers, by threat of a nation-wide
strike, surely the wages of the other
four-flfths would require adjustment.
Manifestly the resources of the rail
roads would not permit granting all
employes the same proportionate in

CRUISER SHELLS
TURKISH COAST
Amsterdam, March 20, Via London
—The following Turkish communica
tion has been received here:
"In the Dardanelles a cruiser un
successfully shelled the neighborhood
of Teke Burnu and Beyaz Tepe. Two
enemy aeroplanes which crossed over
the Galllpoli peninsula were obliged
to retreat before the machine gun fire
of one of our battle planes.
"In the Caucasus in a counter at
tack by our left wing we captured
some enemy war material.~
shall get their present ten hoars pay
for eight hours or less service, thus
increasing the hourly rate by 35 per
oent and for over-time, one and a
half times the new higher hourly rate,
an advance of 87 1-2 per cent.
Higher Pay Demand.
'It is not a demand for an eight
hour work day. It is frankly a de
mand for higher wages on an eight
hour pay day basis—the eight-hour
pay to be a minimum, but the equiv
alent of the present ten hours pay.
"Not only are these train employes
not asking for an eight-hour work
day. but they would bitterly oppose
any effort of the railroads to make
them work eight hours a day—no
more and no less.
"Considering the high wages and
the favorable working conditions en
Joyed by the trainmen, as compared
with other railroad men and workers
in other Industries, their demand for
still higher wages is not a fair one.
Nor Is it an honest statement to put
this demand for higher wages in the
form of a plea for an eight-hour day.
Pay Roll Big Item.
"The railroad payroll for 1914 waa
l,S8l,000,000—or nearly two-thirds
of the cost of operating the roads.
The poyroll absorbs 45 cents of every
dollar the public pays for transporta
tion.
"The stockholders of American
railroads have a vital interest In the
cost of operating their properties and
espeolally in a threatened increase In
labor cost that would absorb a large
of the surplus left for dlvi-
part
dend
and up—with Union Label Fit Guaranteed.
