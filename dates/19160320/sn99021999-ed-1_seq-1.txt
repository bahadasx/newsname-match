"Sixty-five per cent of the chan

"The remarkable showing- of small col

"Charles Kvans Hughes is, without

republican want to see president than
any other man. I knew his father. Dr.
Hughes, for years. He waa one of the
foremost Baptists and Charles Evans
Hughes got his education In Colgate
and Brown universities. He waa the best
governor we ever had back in New
Tork. And today in the south there are
thousands of democrats who would vote
for him Just because they would like
to see a Baptist In the White House.
"Wilson and Bryan are the command

No word has yet neen received by Ga

to be settled between Washington and

They were Informed that the
Mexican leader passed through this

In his command wag mounted. They
pressed through a section of Mexico
where water was scarce. For such
a large body of men the speed main
tained was remarkable and the good
condition In which they camo
through was inspiring.
Only a few cavalry horses and
pack mules were lost, the victims of
a hard riding, trail. The men
reached camp thirsty and hungry,
but otherwise in good condition, fit
for action and eager for the pursuit
of Villa to begin in earnest. Here
they were met with reports that Villa

General Pereklagr Tarns Ilia Men
for March to MoHlilm,
EL PA8O. Tex., March 1. The
first phase of the American expedi
tion into Mexico, the rush ' along
Villa's dim trail to the endangered
Mormon colonies, was an accom
plished fact last night completed,
according to reports reaching the Co
lumbus base, without the firing of a
hostile shot by the Americana.
The second phaae already waa be
ginning, It waa indicated here, as
the Americans turned somewhere
from Casas Grandes to resume their
night marches under - the brilliant
Mexican moonlight toward thorough
mountain slopes where it is known
Pancho Villa already has preceded
them with more than 100 miles
start.
Warning that thla second act in the
chase might not pass without fighting
against bandlta waa Implied in a new and
more stringent censorship Imposed at
Columbus. Farther leakage of news of
military movements, the censor said
frankly to the American press, would be
likely to cost aoldlerV lives.
Rroaahf In on Stretchers.
There was brief excitement Saturday at
Columbus from acroes the hot, dusty
Mexican border, two soldiers on stretch
ers being brought Into camp. Both were
cavalrymen. The excitement passed
when It was learned that one had been
thrown from his horse, injuring his leg.
while the other, who at first waa said
to have, been shot in the abdomen, was
found to be suffering from a well-known
form of stomachache.
When Washington announced that the
American columns did not Intend to oc
cupy any towns In Mexico, a menace to
Mexican national pride waa removed. ThA
Carranza garrisons, which have been
paaaed by the marching Americana and
which, therefore, are now in the Ameri
cans' rear on their flanks, continue tran
