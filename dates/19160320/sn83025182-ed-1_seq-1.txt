At the head of a fresh column of

Casas Grandes as a base, the hard

hoped today to get Into actual con

Reports that Villa is perpetrating new
outrages upon Isolated American colo

his new dash south. Word of these
attacks, received at headquarters
here, arouse evident apprehension.
While not officially confirmed, the
fact that the reports were passed by

EL PASO, Texas, March 20.—On
the verge of a nervous breakdown,
Mrs. Wallace Rogers of Detroit,
Mich., the wife of a mine owner, to
day hugged her baby tightly in her
arms and retold the story of their
two day refuge in an abandoned cop
per mine shaft in the Cananea dis
trict while Villi8ta bandits ravaged
the countryside and sought to slay
all Americans. Rats, bats and un
derground lizards added terrors to the
black depths of the abandoned shaft,
Mrs. Rogers said, and she was com
pelled to sustain the baby's life with
condensed milk, rattling the emptied
cans to frighten away the rats.
Mrs. Rogers said the Mexicans be
came infuriated at the sight of the
American flag and respected only the
British flag. Many Americans, she
asserted, were compelled at times to
seek pr9tection under the folds of the
British union Jack.
Vincenzo Visconti, an Italian, today
wired the Italian embassy at Wash

brother Farico Visconti, by bandits,
near Santa Rosalia, Chihuahua, March

protest to the state department.
"Crimes of this kind are commit

Mexico," Visconti wired the ambas

A number of other local Italians to
day were drawing a protest to be for

that it be formally sent to Secretary

Italian dead without the slightest
