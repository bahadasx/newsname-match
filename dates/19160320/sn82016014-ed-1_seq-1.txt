Pershing has directed his greatest ef
forts in a southeasterly direction as
announced by General Funston today,
practically indicates that Villa has
swung to the south and east since
passing through Colonia Gracia and
is now near Namiquipa.
With his small band of followers
Villa was today reported to b moving
along the mountains on the Sierra
Madre toward Durango. An expedition
as large aa Pershing's could not pass
mf r the -sb me "route. Colonel Dodd's
cavalrymen were reported to be with
in 60 miles of Villa although over

approaching the Ta rahumare range
today and was not out of the trap set
by Carranzista garrisons at Chihua
httgi Cltjr, Namiquipa and Madera.
The American Mormon colonists re
lieved by the presence of Pershing's
forces were not inclined today to leave
Mexico. They were likely to be or
dered to the border by General Per
shing, according to reports received by
Kl Paso Mormons.

Mill declined today to offr resistance.
General Funston's reports from the
commander of the expeditionary!
forces told the manner in which the
forces are operating south of Casaj
Grandes. but offered little reason fori
h belief that any clash with the re
treating bandits would occur today or!
even tomorrow.
Most of the information reaching
General Pershing indicated that Villa j
was heading for the mountains in tho
Guerrero districts. Americans who
hpve spent many years in that part of i
Mexico are now bein? used as scouts I
and guides over the trails that lead 1
to tho south and east of Casas
Grandes.
Reinforcements Arrive.
The force actually being need in the I
chase of Villa was strengthened today
by the arrival at Casas Grandes of de- j
tacnrnents ri 'he Thirteenth infantry j
and Fourth field artillery and the !
aero squadron. Reports to army 1
headquarters did not indicate whether!
the aeroplanes moved forward on
their trucks or by flying.
It is assumed here that General
Pershing will immediately avail him
self of the service of the eight aero
planes. It has been assumed at armv
headquarters that the Carranza troops
are joining heartily in the task of i
running from Villa, but what the Mex- j
ican troops are doing is unknown bv
the Americans.
The soldiers of both countries are j
working to the same end. but the
Mexican commanders have not re- t
vealed to the American officers their (
plans ana just where the troops are
who are supposed to be co-operating
with the Americans is unknown.
Mexican Garrison Friendly.
General Pershing reported today
that the garrison at Casas Grandes
was "friendly but passive." in the
same report he said that the Mormon
colonists there looked upon Americans
as their "rescuers." N'ew estimates
made by General Pershing placed
Villa's losses in killed wounded and
deserted since crossing the line to at
tack Columbus at two hundred.
General Pershing made no mention
in his reports of further attacks by
Villa upon American colonists. Re
assuring reports from the border near
'jinaga were received here today.
Colonel Sibley reported yesterday he
talked with Colonel Rojaj, the com
mander of the garrison at Ojinaga.
who was reported killed by his own

The above resolution was adopted

ager of the eastern lines of the Santa

demand of enginemen and trainmen
for on eight-hour basic day, with time
and one-halt' for overtime. The reso
lution was presented by C. M. Burge.
John S. Ivan presided in the abseme
of W. W. Webb, president of the
Commercial club. K. I I-indemuth is
chairman of the committee on trans
portation. Mr. Kouns outlined the demands
presented by the enginemen and train
men, declaring that the granting of
the increase in wages would cost the
Santa Fe system alone 52,750.000 per
year. further Mr. Kouns declared
that it won 1H imnihiP tVvr- ,h(1
would be impossible for the
system with its present revenue to
meet such an increase.
Public Must Pay.
"It must be met in one of two
ways" said Mr. Kouns. "We must
either get more business at the pres
ent rate or a higher rate for the pres
ent business. In short we would be
forced to extract the money from the
business men and public at large."
The proposal of the employees de
manding a raise to change terminals
would cost the Santa Fe 100 million
dollars, according to Mr. Kouns's fig
ures. Even the trainmen have aban
doned this proposition, he declared.
Wage More Now.
"Already the wage of these em
ployees average $1,300 per annum
against $700 per annum of the other
employees." said Mr. Kouns. "And the
enginemen and trainmen comprise
only 18 per cent of the total number
of employees. However, I think these

Sidelights
on the
State Convention
Guy Glascock of Hutchinson, secre
tary of the state committee, was one
of the first delegates to the convention
to arrive in Topeka. He awoke a
slumbering hotel clerk Sunday morn
ing and asked for a room with a bath.
Six hours after Glascock's arrival a
half dozen more delegates had arrived
and the milling was officially started.
S. P. Fitzpatrick of Independence,
former state senator from Montgom
ery county and leader of the famous
senate lodge, came to Topeka via Chi
cago. Last week Fitzpatrick was
elected as one of the delegates to the
na tional convention in Chicago. In
Topeka, however, Fitzpatrick denied
most emphatically that he left im
mediately for Chicago In order to se
lect seats for the Kansas delegation in
the convention hall.
j. s. Stewart of Wichita, former j
state senator i rom eeogwaca county ,
and a recent candidate for delegates
to Chicago from the Kighth district,
is attending the convention as a dele
gate from Sedgwick county. The for
mer Sedgwick senator is also visiting
his son-in-law and daughter, Mr. and
Mrs. George McDermott.
William Short, mayor of Concordia,
is here with the Cloud county dele
gation. Short has for years been j
active in Republican a f fairs in his
county and district and has been a well
known character at Republican ,
gatherings in Topeka.
Lee Meadows and Joe Jackson of
Lincoln came this afternoon with the
Lincoln county delegates Both fa -vor
harmony in the convention. "This
harmony plan ought to work two
ways, though,' said Jackson. "If it
is in the interest of harmony that Mill- j
vane should get out. some one ought
to put a halter on Bristow and lead
him out. Regular Republicans are '
willing to give a ood deal in the in-
: terests of harmony, but Bristow is J
' more than they can take."
W. A. Holland of Emporia came to ;
i Topeka with a grouch against news
paper publishers. They are too ac

situation is as bad under the primary
system as it was a few years .igo when

Holland, who classes himself as a real
sure enough tiller of the s il, wants
at least a couple of ruralists on the

' national committeemanship will not
be an issue. David W. Mulvane of
Topeka, will not be a candidate for the
; national committeemanship and rep
resentatives of both factions today ex
pressed faith in the ability of dele
gates to the Chicago convention to
agree on a man acceptable to both
wings of the party. With the word
, that Mulvane was not an issue in the
state convention, J. R. Burrow of To
peka, was also effectually eliminated
from the race.
The "Big Four."
The one issue before the delegates
who arrived in Topeka today was the
' personnel of delegates at large to the
i national convention. Four delegates
and four alternates will be chosen at
the convention in the auditorium
Tuesday noon. Six men are considered
or the places. In the selection of
elegates both the regulars and pro
rressives will be recognized. A pro
rram which today seems certain of
id option means a virtual fifty-fifty
iivision of the delegation at large.
Charles F. Scott of Iola, is re
garded as an almost certain choice of
the convention. Scott, with virtually
the solid Second district behind him,
has an almost equally strong following
in the First and Third district and suf
ficient votes in other congressional
districts to practically insure his elec
tion by any method of deduction. It is
in the First, Second and Third dis
tricts that the heavy voles are polled.
Scott's support, however, is strong in
all of the eight districts.
Al F. Williams, well known Colum
bus lawyer, came to Topeka with the
endorsement of the Third district con
vention and a big following in the
large counties of the Second and First
districts. Williams is a regular. He
has for years been active in politics
in the Third district and is generally
given a place on the dope sheets of
men who will win before Tuesday's
convention.

After Governor Ralston signed
Taggart's commission, he wrote him a
I letter saying: it afforded him genuine
pleasure to appoint him United States

Rolston. "at great personal sacrifice

Washington. March 20. General
Carranza has formally protested j
against American troops occupying
Casas Grandes in their pursuit of
Villa and the American government
has replied that the troops have been
ordered specifically not to occupy
Casas Grandes .or any other towns or
cities in Mexico.
The protest and reply were includ
ed in an exchange of notes between
Acting Secretary Polk of the state de
partment and Eliseo Arredondo, am
bassador designate to the United
States from Mexico. After a confer
ence early today between President
Wilson and Mr. Polk it became known
that Mr. Polk in a note forwarded to
Mexico yesterday said instruction had
been sent to General Funston to keep
his
troops away from all towns.
