government permission to use Mexican
railways to transport supplies to
American troops pursuing Francisco |
Villa overshadowed everything else in.!
the Mexican situation here today.
The reply ot General Carranza to!
the request or the government for'
]>ermission to use the railroads was I
expected to be sent to Washington to
clay. A refusal will embarrass the .
operations of the troops while the ]
granting of the request, it was declared.
would be bound to be seriously
misconstrued by a considerable sec-;
tlon of the Mexican people and to be:
exploited by the enemies of General
Cur ran za.
The unexpectedly rapid advance of
the expeditionary column has forced
the railroad question to an issue.
Americans familiar with the country
Into which the columns are now enter- >
ing assert that it is imperative that;
the railroads be placed at their disposal
for the bringing up of supplies.
Villa has doubled east and south

received by General Gavira at Juarez
Monday. He reports that Carranza

ASSOCIATED PKCSSJ
COLUMBUS, March 20.?Increased
activity on the part of the troops
stationed here and the arrival during
the night of a number of troop
and supply trains Indicated today that
additional forces shortly will be on
tbelr way to augment the punitive
American expeditionary force now in
the field in northern Mexico.
In addition to the troops which d,e-|
trained here, a large part of which
were cavalry, many passed through,!
bobnd apparently for some polht
westward along the border. Soldiers
were kept busy throughout the day J
preparing combat and hospital trainB;
and carrying equipment to the field i
force.
One .of the problems which the I
commissary department at the mill-;
tary base has been striving desperate-;
ly to solve is that of supplies with;
which to feed the troops. For sev-i
era! years the internal strife in Mexl-j
co hus practically stifled the agricultural
interests of that district in Mexico,
through which the American
troops are believed to. be passing. As
a result neither food for the men nor
forage for the animals can be ob-'
talned In Mexico and must be transported
from here.
H Major W. R. Sample, commandant
at the military field base here, has
kept In communication with General
Pershlng'B forces means of the)
ariny wireless, but clinging tenacious
Iy to the censorship ruling he refused
10 make public any information received.
Instructions hive been issued
that not only information sent out by
newspaper correspondents must be
censored, but also that of officers and
men in the army and citizens of Columbus
must be passed on. All in
coming telegraph messages aTe read
and approved by the censor before delivery.
Hurried preparations were made
today for a cantonment hospital. This
I hospital Is to co-operate with the field
hospital and ambulance companies
now with the expeditionary force and
with the hospital at El Paso.
I The aeroplane squad was kept very
I busy throughout the early part of the
day. making practice flights about the
camp. There was no Indication as to
when the planes will leave to join
I the troops in the field.
