City Clerk J. , Alex II. Robinson
opened a note awhile back. The mis
sive was not scented with the perfume
of violet soap, so popular in city hall.
Nor was it reminiscent of soft soap,
It was a firm, stern demand frorn Mrs.
Frank Wallenta for more rent. She is
a woman of property. She lives at
3,387 Main street and is the owner of
"a number of dwellings which she
rents, one of her tenants being the city,
clerk,

' The board of assessors did increase

the board of relief announced an in

1 to such an extent that she employed
an attorney to oppose it..
Mrs. Wallenta, instead of regarding
i tjity Clerk - Robinson's letter as a
friendly tip, - filled with good fellow-
I ship, appears to have regarded it as a
threat "that her. taxes would be raised
if his rent was. . i

ter to Mr. Robinson that ch intenrio

I On receipt of Mrs. Wallejita's letter
notifying him-of the increase in rent.
Mr. Robinson promptly wrote back
stating that he , did not consider the
increase in his rent warranted and nln
telling Mrs. Wallenta' that it was the
purpose of the assessors to increase
the valuation on all' property where
landlords raised rents. . Mr. Robinson
claims that his letter was couched In
friendly terms and not Intended to
convey a threat. He also claimed that
he had made repairs to his flat at his
own expense, which he otherwise felt
his landlady in' duty bound 'to make.
Nevertheless ..' Mrs.
Wallenta decided
the increase should stand. Therefore
Mr. Robinson will seek another flat.
Mrs. Wallenta owns ten pieces of
property,, most of them having two
family houses. The tax assessors this

He denied the letter was written as a
threat from one in- public office, but
snid no nafl written it n anv nrivatu
citizen might write about a private af
fair. He said: -
"Such an increase as Mrs. Wallenta
made her tenants was very unfair. Her
taxes were- Increased but a trifle over
$70 per year. She asked me to pay
$60 of this $70 and besides that she
proposed to collect ten times that same
amount from her other tenants. When
I wrote Mrs. Wallenta I considered I
was writing on my own private bus

Mrs. Wallenta employed an attor

today 'had not received a reply to the
