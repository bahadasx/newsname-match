Announcement : to- this effect was
made by the governor this morning.
As published last week fn the Star

ing of delay in settling their contracts,
many of them negotiating unofficial
contracts with Makee Sugar Company
in the absence of a settlement of the
terms with the Lihue Plantation, the
governor not having approved these
latter. . v'
: l has been a case of conflicting in
terests, of individuals who were not
themselves sure what they? wanted,
and of the territory's trying to protect
the 'public interest,"' said the 'govern

Is called I shall ask the homesteaders
what they want-

tory isn't going to be forced into hasty
action by the vlewa of ; individuals
which . may. not coincide with' public
policy. He hopes that a personal visit
with the ne w ? land ' commissioner will
result in a clearing of the atmosphere;
Furthermore, License Inspector
K Says He Took Initiative , in
Promising " Suspended Sen
tences to German Sailors
: Liquor License Inspector Fennell of
his own Initiative arranged that the
two German sailors of the warbound
German steamships should plead guil
ty to the charge of selllngr liquor illic
itly and receive a suspehded sentence.
r;Folldwing the developmehta on 'Sat:
irday';fn"the 'pollee courty .when -the
aallori pleaded guilty- and were given
suspended sentences, the Star-Bulletin
today asked Inspector Fennel! to ex
plain just how the arrangement, as
told Saturday by the sailors' attorney,
waB entered into
':. He did so as follows:
"One Sunday I secured evidence of
the illicit sale of liquor on. the Ger
man ships. For a couple of days we
were preparing to serve warrants. On
Tuesday morning, on may way down
town, I stopped in to see Chairman
Lowrey of the license commission and
suggested that an arrangement could
be made that the men be arrested,
plead guilty and receive suspended
sentences. So far as I know he had
no objection, as on many previous
occasions I have taken this course as
the wisest policy to use in breaking
up Illicit liquor-selling.
I "Later in the morning I saw Attor
ney Frank Thompson in court and
asked aim if he would be defending
attorney in the case of these Bailors.
He said that it would be in his hands
and I then suggested to him that it
could be arranged for the sailors to
plead guilty and get suspended sen
tences."
, "Yon made the suggestion, then?"
"Yes, he said nothing to me until I
took It up with him. Then be assent
ed and we went down to Hackf eld's
and talked it over in their office. Con
sul Rodiek was absent, but it was
talked over with one of the Hackfeld
Officials and one of the consulate offi
cials. . In the afternoon I went to
Hackfeld's again and the two sailors,
who had been sent for, were there.
The maUer was explained to them in
German and they agreed whereupon
I served the warrants. The cases
then went along until last Saturday
when the men pleaded guilt; and the
sentences were ruspended.
Gives His Reasons.
"Why did you favor suspending
sentence?" :
V "Well, after I examined into the
matter I found that the law wasn't
being very badly broken. - The sailors
were selling big schooners of beer for

AS TO MENTALITY
Proceedings for perpetuation of tes
timony, which will form a part of the
equity suit brought by Delegate Kuhio
against the trustees cf the Liliuo
kalanl Trust, will begin in Circuit
Judge W'hitney's court at 9 o'clock
tomorrow morning.
In accordance with a petition filed
by Antonio Perry, counsel for Queen
Liliuokalani, the testimony of Miss
Lucy Ward and Miss Onaona Bell, the
latter being a. resident of Vancouver,
B. C., will be taken. Miss Bell is now
visiting in Honolulu. The testimony
will concern the sanity and mental
competency of the queen.
Both Miss Ward and Miss Bell are
Intimate friends of the queen, and
have visited her frequently. Whether
Liliuokalani was mentally competent
to the extent that she might protect
her affairs, was made an issue in the
original suit filed by Kuhio. The su
preme court has held that there is a
presumption of sanity as regards the
queeh, and that she Is not . properly a
party-complainant' in the suit which
was filed by Kuhio In her name.
