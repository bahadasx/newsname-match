of the present Greek governrae it to

The expression is scarcely acci irate,
for, while the prices of the ord nary
commodities of life, and espet ially fowl
stuffs, have in many Instances do ibled
and in Irtually all Instances gr jatly
increased in the past jear, the fault
Is largely with Greece. If ther j be
serious discomfort In the country it is
quite as much due to bad internal nan
agement as to the mastery of the Med
iterranean maintained by the Frrtnco
British fleet The "starving" projess.
therefore, is much more apt to let d to
trouble for the present Greek cal lnet
than, unaccompanied by other circ um
stance, to Greece's enforced partici

of Mexican railroad lines for movement
of supplies to the punitive expedition,

plv was sent to president Wilson The
information he asks will bo furnished
In urging the use of Mexican rail
roads for that purpose, it has been
pointed out to the Carranza govern

last fall
Wouldn't Tnke Over Roods.
Mr. Polk declared today that the
United States had not requested per
mission to take over any railroads In
Mexico, but had merely asked for per
mission to trangggrt supplies.
Every effort is? being made hy Oi
state department to disseminate, in
Mexico the information that tho United
States has no motives of aggression In
sending troops across the border. Fol
lowing out the same policy, the Amer
ican troops now in Mexico havo been
given Instructions to be careful in their
dealings with Mexicans generally.
No Information Of Intervention Plots.
Generally, reports from Mexico today
were optimistic in character. Mr. Folk
denied emphatically reports that tbs
government had any reliable informa
tion of plots to bring about armed in
tervention. Gen. Carranza, It was learned today,
had been urged by some of his closest
advisers, to offer a large reward for Uia
apprehension of Villa
Villa In C.iierrerr. District.
Villa, fleeing with his outlaw fol
lowers, before the advance of tho
American expeditionary forces In Mex
ico, has reached his own country In the
Guerrero district, where high officers
of the army said he may almost In
definitely evade capture. If tho bandit
chieftain makes a stand, Washington
is satisfied that the campaign will
quickly end, but If he leaves his fol
lowers, he can, military authorities
auree, reach a haven or safety in tho
nearby mountains In less than a daVs
i iding.
Ilea Many Hiding Places.
Tn the Gueriero district and in the
country adjacent to Bablcora, Villa is
at homex For years he operated there
in defiance of the laws of Mexico an 1
its constituted authoiities. The moun
tains to the west offer countless hidtnsr
places ami routes of escape If hard
piessed Villa might, officials believed,
abandon his men, don the garb of
peon, flee so far into the south that It
would be exceedingly difficult, if not
impossible to apprehend him.
Scout re lmployed
To meet Just this situation. Gen.
Pershing, it was learned, has authority
to employ scouts, who have lived thelf
lives in the mountainous districts.
These men know the hiding places and
th retreats to which the bandits are
sure to take refuge if hard pressed.
Upon them as a final resort, will fall
the task of trailing Villa to earth.
Elaborate scouting plans are under
stood to p-ie been . ompleted.
Pershing May enreh Tonus.,
The war department has at the re
quest of the state department, sent ex
plicit Instruction to the foi res l.
