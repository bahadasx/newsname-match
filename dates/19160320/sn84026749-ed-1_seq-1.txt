"Tom" Taggart has virtually ruled

also served as district chairman In the
(Seventh district for a time, lie was
elected mayor ot Indianaiiolls in Wva,
anu served three terms, until 1001, de

political enemies to defeat him.
Mr, Taggart was the Indiana mem
ber ot the Democratic riational com

troni 1301 to W.
Tho sagacity that enabled Mr. Tag
gart to rise from his job as waiter In

VILLA ELUDES fflS
PURSUERS, DASHES
INTO MOUNTAINS
Bandit Chief Escapes Trap Set For Him By
Carranza and U. S. Troops and Makes
, Desperate Effort to Reach
Stronghold in Hills. .
LONG AND BITTER
Outlaw Knows Every Inch of Wild Sierra
Madre Country and Can Keep Soldiers
Off His Track For Months By
Dodging, Army Men Fear.
Every ounce of energy is being expended by Persfi
ing's "flying column" in an effort to head off Villa before
he reaches his lair in the Sierra Madres mountains.
The second week of the expedition to capture the dar
ing bandit began today with every indication that the chase
is to be a desperate one.
Hot oh the trail of the wily Mexican, Pershing's troops
are engaged in one of the most spectacular man-hunts on
, record. Every device known to Villa is being used in an
effort to exhaust his pursuers.
According to advices from the border today, Villa has
'.succeeded in escaping the trap .laid for him by Carranzista
'-and American -troops and is dashing Tor -his mountain
stronghold.
Knowing every foot of the territory, of which the
American troopers know practically nothing, he appears
from the meager dispatches coming from the border to be
beating back and forth through the mountain passes with
aggravating ease.
At the State and War Departments today officials set
their jaws firmly and insisted that the cha'se will go on,
come what may. "Villa, dead or alive," has-been resur
rected from a maze of conflicting statements as to the
purpose of the expedition.
CONFUSION CAUSED BY STATEMENT.
Although the President, in his original announce
ment, declared "an adequate force would be sent to cap
ture Villa," confusion has resulted from the statement of
Secretary Baker thaf the troops were going into Mexico "to
capture or disperse" the brigand bands.
President Wilson had an early conference today with
Acting Secretary of State Frank L. Polk. After it had been
concluded the word went forth once more that the purpose
of the expedition is to "get Villa'."
How long it will take to get hi,m is another matter.
Francisco Villa has had a price on his head from time to
time for a quarter of a century.
The pick of old Porfirio Diaz's troops haunted his
trail for fifteen years, while Villa mocked his pursuers and
continued his career of plunder and murder.
Seasoned campaigners at the War Department have
not the enthusiastic confidence of junior officers, that Villa
will be captured in a few days, or a few weeks.
EFFORT TO RALLY MEXICANS.
In the meantime the poison of sedition is being indus
triously injected into the followers of Carranza in an effort
to rally them behind Villa's banner. Deliberately miscon
struing the purposes of the expedition, and making it ap
pear as the forerunner of general intervention, secret
agents are at work on both sides of the border to stir up
feeling against the United States.
State Department officials privately admit that the
pursuit of Villa is being used by pro-interventionists to
force war between the United States and Mexico.
The evidence has been turned over to the Depart
ment of Justice, and the Secret Service may disclose at
any time the fact that Villa is. being made the tool of .in
fluential Americans with interests in 'Mexico which would
be promoted by intervention.
Officials of the Administration do not attempt to be
little the embarrassment with which Carranza is surround
ed. Threatened with treachery as he constantly was be
