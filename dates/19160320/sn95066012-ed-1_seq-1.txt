TUBANTIA NOT TORPEDOED
Germany. Denies Responsibility for
Sinking of Liner.
Berlin, March 19. By wireless to
Sayvllle. No German submarine could
have been in the vicinity of the spot
where the Dutch liner Tubantia was
sunk, and no German mines had been
laid in this region, the German ad
miralty announced. The official state
ment Issued under date of March 18,
says:
"The Dutch navy department has
stated that according to the sworn
declarations of the first and fourth offi
cers and lookout men of the steamship
Tubanita, the course of a torpedo was
clearly seen.
"A German submarine is out of the
question in connection with the sink
ing of the Tubantia as the place where
the accident took place is less than
thirty miles from the Dutch coast
which means that this place is within
the territory declared to be not danger
ous for shipping by the manifesto of
February 4, 1915. It is further stated
that no German mines were laid
there."
The first Jury trial of the Marph
term of Rutland county court has
been started at Rutland. Mrs. Mary
Pullinen of Proctor a Finnish wom
an, is seeking to recover $2,500 from
Mrs. Lisa Loakso, a fellow country

flecting on the morals of the plaintiff
and injuring her reputation among her
neighbors. Miss Fanny K. Lamml of
Worcester, Mass., a Finnish girl of 18
years and an expert in her line, is in
terpreter in the case. A women in
terpreter is a great rarity in the Rut
land court and the girl attracts much

El Paso, Tex., March 19. Francisco
Villa has been driven into a trap by
the rapid advance of tho American
troops, according to information re
ceived today in wireless dispatches
from the front and in telegraphic dis
patches to General Gabriel Gavira,
Carranza commander at Juarez.
Everything seems now to depend on
the ability of the Carranza garrisons
to hold their end of the net. On three
sides the bandit chief is hemmed in
by strong Carranza columns, while on
the fourth, the Americans are driving
forward with amazing speed. 1
Villa was reported in the Babricora
lake region tonight on the ranch of
Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, which he has
ravaged several times in the , past.
Babricora is about fifty-five miles
south of Galeana, where one section
of the American expeditionary Uorce
has arrived and is pushing forwanrat
the rate of thirty-three miles a day.
A few miles to the west of the ban
dit's position is- Namiqulqa, which is
held by a powerful Carranza garrison.
On the east are the frowning barHET
of -the Sierra Madre mountains bar
ring the way to Sonora. General Louis
Gutierrez, Carranza's field chiff.'de
'clares that he holds all the passes to
Sonora' i .
To the south Villa's way is Mocked
by the Carranza sarrison at Madera, a
town of considHjuble Importance, and.
the headquarters of te Madera com-;
pany limited, an" Anieiean Concern,
which has vastlnmbor, mining and
railroad interests. On account of the.
importance of this town an exception
ally heavy Carranza force is said to
hold it.
While Carranza leaders and United
States military authorities have suc
ceeded so fijr in avoiding any friction,
there is one serious question which
may arise at any time to threaten the
entire situation. As the lines of
communication of the American force
lengthen, the problem of bringing up
supplies becomes increasingly more
pressing. i . '
To grant the United States Remis
sion to use the Mexicart railrdads for
shipping supplies; it is thought here
may be misconstrued by many Mexi
cans. On the iother hand b. refusal
would scarcely .harmonize with the
professed desire of the. Carranza gov
ernment to co-operate i in every way
with the American authorities. The
arrival of this crisis isi being anxious
ly awaited on 'both, sides of the border.

DR. CAVERLY SPOKE
Address Before the Fortnightly Satur
f day Afternoon.
The Fortnightly meeting - at High
school hall on Saturday afternoon was
not so ! largely attended as usual, no
doubt on account of the change in the
hou. i
Dr. Charles S. Caverly of Rutland
chairman of the state board of health
gave an Interesting address on "Com
municable Diseases," illustrating many
parts of it' with lantern slide's which
he'pod to impress upon his audience
the Importance of medical research
and the methods used t to suppress
some of the most prolific sources ,, ol
disease. He particularly emphasized
the Importance of discarding the idea
that the long dreaded major' diseases
were .the only ones to be avoided. The
fact that there are now; more deaths
from measles than from either scarlet
fever or diphtheria, should awaken
parents to tho Importance of protecting
their children from this . distemper
Tliut the school room is the- great
promoter of measles and w hooping
ccugh is a recognized fact, and Dr
Caverly spoke strongly in favor oi
medical inspection in the schools as
one of the most important among
modern methods of saving the live
of young children, by protecting them
from contracting diseases which would
in many cases prove fatal. He was
surprised that Bennington had not yet
adopted medical inspection as most oi
the important cities in the state have
already done so and have had most
beneficial results.
Dr. Caverly's lecture was a supple-

DO A10N
A LABOR TICKET
Proposed by Ernest D. Barber For
Tomorrow.
Editor of The Banner:! wish to
calle attention to the fact that a labor
ticket is before the people in the vil
lage election, and some of the reasons
for its being presented.
Without discussing personalities,
the opposing ticket, to a large degree
is scarcely more than the pooled in
terests of different politicians. The
Socialists party by its extreme attitude
makes itself an impractical and inef
fective instrument for working class
action.
The Progressive party by its lack of
cohesive organization, the lack of ag
gressive paity action, and partly the
imperfect working out of some or its
proposed remedies is rapidly nearing
the end of its usefulness for the bet
terment of working class conditions.
And this situation is bringing the old
parties into much the positions they
were in years ago. And while there
are a few, both Democratic and Re'
publican leaders, who sincerely work
and plan for working class betterment,
the number of such leaders are very
limited. So there seems to be no op
tion but to try a new channel, if work
ing class betterment is to be secured
The only question is whether the
working class want such an advance
If they do not and are content with
present conditions as the standard foi
a long time to come, then any attempt
at working class action must be futile
'I he one trouble with accepting the
present standard as a permanent one
is that alter working class advance has
ceased the great capitalists are apt tt
make advances in their own interests
which will then lower even present
standards of working class living.
There are many things which should
be done, but let us look at one that
presents itself now. There is a cur
few law proposed which will raostl.
affect the children of the working
class. Without discussing its meriti
or demerits, supposing it is passed
Undoubtedly it will give more or les:
discretionary power to the board o
trustees, in exercising those powers
should there not be upon the board
one or more members who will present
the strictly working class viewpoint?
In fact is it not the great difficult
of today that the strictly working clas;
viewpoint Is seldom heard and almos
never noticed.
Some great capitalists are sometime!
presenting their views of what thej
think the working class should have
and what they are willing to give
them. And the middle class often pn
sent their views Of what the workmt
class should have, but.the views of tht
working class itself seldom receive at
tention. And where their views have
received attention it has mostly beer.
after strikes, violence and political up
heavals. And after all : the - uselesi
struggle was over, their views wen
found not to be so bad. ; ,
It seems to me that the ' workinf
class should make an, opening foi
themselves and should have a channe'.
and permanent means for the express
ion of their Mews and that now is t
gcod time to begin.
There stands in the near future tht
possibility, though I will not say cer
tainty of the formation of a natlona
labor party. Different groups anc"
bodies of workmen and working clas'
organizations around the country havi
already indicated their intentions o
making a beginning in that directiot
during present year. And one or mor
prominent working class leaders it
other states are or have been castint
off the shackles of other parties am
are seriously looking toward a nev
move even in this coming campaign.
The labor unions of Massachusetts
and Boston have already voted to pu
up a state ticket this fall and to make
.some contests in the Boston Cit;-
election.
Bennington has always taken f
prominent part in every move to ad
vance human liberty whether that
nove was political, military or educa
tiona'l in its nature. We were sonu
years independent before joining th
other states. We fought, and deter
mined the critical battle of the revolu
tionary wdr.
And undoubtedly a Bennington com
pany at the head of Stannard's Ver
mcnt brigade by its heroic action de
termined the result of Pickett's charge
it Gettysburg and thus saved the da:
for tho Union. That battle was the
turning point of the war. It is some
times, stated, though perhaps not yet

PRICE OF PAPER GOING UP.
War Stops Shipment of Rags and Oth
er Pulp Material from Europe. -
Some grades of paper have advanced
two cents a pound since last Monday
and are likely to continue to rise.
Europe is not sending any rags now
as grist for American paper mills, and,
is this country never depended entire
ly on its own pulp supply, the book.
ind the magazine makers are likely to
have to pay more for their stock.
Since France and other European,
ouutries, owing to the war, have

States American manufacturers of':
Sigh grade paper have had to put up
.heir prices, as they formerly depend- ij

pulp of various grades, but also for .
"The coating or sizing of paper is
-omposed largely of casein. It is real- .;
y cheese. Formerly it was cheap and
tbundant. A good deal of it used to
ome from Denmark. Some was made
here. In days like these all the milk
s needed for making cheese in this
ountrv. for the importation of those
ieleee cheeses from abroad has largely
'alien' off: " Glue has' its place iu sur-
acing paper, and there; are other con-
,Utuent3 as well. " Alt "White paper is
nade to appear mbre -so by using blue
lyes all of which' are' yery high. Col
irs which were fonfierly ouly 40 or 60
ents a pound are sold for f 18 and 20
i pound." 1 " - "'.'J
Manufacturers also' say there has
:een a great decreata in the importa-
lons of sulphites. 'Formerly there
vere 1,000 to 1.200 tons Imported daily
is compared with 375 tons a day which
are now received.
The cheap grades of brown papers
mch as are used lor wrapping meat
nd groceries have also risen in price.
The increased cost of pulp has sent
IP prices of paper boxes to two and
hree times what they were before tho
.var in fancy grades.
The effect of the high paper prices ,
nd tho scarcity of paper itself is felt .
iy practically every industry these
lays, for even pencils with which to
.vrite on paper are getting more ex-
lensive. Many of. them are finished
nith a special varnish, which contains '
t good deal of dye material, and, as the
lyes go up, the - manufacturers have
;ither to ask more money for their
encils or sell them as unadorned
;edar. '
WEATHER FORECAST
For eastern New York and western
Vermont, increase in cloudiness and
warmer tonight, probably snow. Snow
or rain Tuesday and warmer.
Joseph Marcot, of Woodstock, used
lasoline In building a fire with tho
isual disastrous results. Failing to
tart a fire with paper he went to get
kerosene, but' by mistake got a gaso-
ine bottle. He poured some into the
-,tove and at the resulting flash started
backward so quickly as to throw -
gasoline on his clothing and across his
2hest. He was badly burned about the
neck and face and his ears were nearly
ooked.
The Rev. Alfred J. Hugh, pastor of
'he Methodist church at Brownsville
(in West Windsor) is to retire at the
noming session o fthe Vermont Meth
idist Conference at Montpelier March
9. Mr. Hugh Is a native of England
but began his ministry in Hartland
12 years ago. Since then he has oc-
upied many of the best pulpits ot
tho couferencs and probably has the
unique distinction of having served
two pastorates at Montpelier and
three at White River Junction.
Rutland's now $5,500 motor fire
truck became stalled while on the way
to a barn fire and had to be shoveled
out. The deep snow and a broken
bain were given as the cause of tho
delay. It was 20 minutes before it
could be started, and in tho mean
time the horse-drawn hose wagon had
passed It and had the fire about out
before the truck arrived. The fall of
18 Inches of snow was too much for
the latter.
