VILLA ESCAPES; LONG HUNT PREDICTED
CANDIDATES
HOW THEY
The Times didn't Bpeak carelessly, bat meant exactly what it said some
days ago —thai it intends to serve Tacoma as a real public i'oniin in this
.spring's city campaign.
More tlian a week ago we sent a letter to each candidate for commission! _•
asking his views on several ol* the most important campaign issues.
Though no small amount of thought and hard work was required to make
intelligent answers to such questions, the candidates for the greater part have
responded whole-heartedly and sincerely. Very little of the usual side step
ping or trimming was in evidence.
Answers already are in from more than half the number, and to date only
( one candidate, Rev. Stoever, has signified an intention not to respond.
With the exception of him and two others, all the candidates who are gen
erally supposed to have any chance of winning have replied. By tonight we
hope to huve the remaining letters in.
Tomorrow we will begin presenting the material thus gathered. It will he
your only opportunity to get the candidates' opinions on these various subjects
• presented fairly and uniformly, and it ought to be a great help to all voters in
selecting men for the two places on the city commission.
Watch for the candidates' symposium in tomorrow's Times.
ADMITS
THERE
IS VICE
Declaring that Hey. Del
mei 11. Trimble had attempt
ed to fill his church with m
seiiH.it ioiml tirade against tbe
i police administration, and
that he had dealt in half
truths in practically all of his
statements, Commissioner
Mills today declared that he
would "call" the pastor's
"bluff."
Mills instructed Police Chief
Bmlth to send two detectives to
Hey. Trimble's parsonage and ob
• tain from him the alleged proof
of the existence of wide-open vice
In Tacoma, which Rev. Trimble
declared last night he could pro
duce.
"The minister was run out of
Portland because he made at
tacks on a church of another de-
I nomination," declared Mills to
day. "I have very good informa
tion to the effect that he Is in
coming disliked by his Tacoma
congregation. Some of my very
beat friends are members of his
church. In fact, I am also a mem
ber of the Methodist church.
Changes Mind.
"1 had at first planned to at
tend the sermon. But I later
came to the conclusion that Rev.
Trimble was merely making a
sensational address to fill up his
church, and 1 realized that I
would be something of an added
attraction, if I went. 1 would be
playing into his hands.
* "I have never said that there
was no gambling nor prostitution
In Tacoma. But I have said, and
do say, that neither Is being con
ducted openly, or ever has since
I have been head of the depart
ment. The police department la
operating under the same orders
regarding vice as it always has."
Predicts Pastor'll (Jo.
0 Mills intimtaed today that the
undercurrent of feeling In the
Methodist church which he says
nxista against Rev. Trimble, may
become pronounced shortly.
"I predict that the pastor won't
be in Tacoma six months from
now," said Mills, enigmatically.
A. D. Whitney, a trustee of the
First church, and for years one
of the staunch workers for the
church, visited Mills today and
had a long interview with him.
Neither he or the commissioner
would admit afterwards that
their conversation had anything

to (lo with cliuroh affairs.
MAKM HITTKB ATTACK
The "Hotel de (Jink" took a
place in the background when
Rev. Trimble launched his attack
on Mills at the First Methodist
church last night charging that
gambling and disorderly houses
are running wide open In Taco
ma.
"It Is avionatic in police admin
istration that the police force will
be Just as good as tlie man at the
head of it and no better," said
Trimble.
"Competent authorities who are
qualified to make comparisons
say that there is more gambling
in Tacoma today than there has
been in > _#ts.
"Open games of gambling were
in operation last week. The ar
rests for gambling have been few
and far between in recent
months. In the interests of pub
lic safety why not an enforce
ment of the gambling law?
"Three competent witnesses In
form me today that last night
at least five houses of ill-fame
were operating In Tacoma. These
witnesses can inform Commission
er Mills as to the place and
number. Does Commissioner
Mills know of the conditon of
affairs? If not is he too lame or
innocent to head a department of
public safety?
"The charge Is general that
there has been an absence of ihe
human equation and a lamentable
lack of the reformatory in the po
lice administration of the past
term of the commissioner of pub
lic safety. The city Jail is a dis
grace to our city."
Trimble quoted an article
which appeared in The Times last
week, exposing a gambling game
in the A. & B. Smoke House, as
proof of his charges of wide-open
gambling.
Divorce for
