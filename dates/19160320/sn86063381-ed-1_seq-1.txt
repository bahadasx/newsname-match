AMENDMENT SOUGHT
FOB DBAINAGE LAW
Minnesota House Members Desire
Swamp Land Bonuses to
Go to Comities.
Washington, March 20.At a
meeting of the Minnesota house mem
bers the delegation has agreed to sup
port an amendment to the Volstead
drainage law, whereby various Min
nesota counties will get the bonus
received from the sale of swamp
lands under the Volstead act instead
of the bonus being paid to the gov
ernment.
Termed Injustice to Counties.
Necessity for this legislation was
emphasized by J. L. George, county
auditor of Beltrami county, and A. A.
Andrews of Bemidji, who were pres
ent at the meeting of the delegation,
and called attention to the injustice
suffered by Beltrami and other coun

act was being construed by the in
terior department.
Volstead Tells Intent of Bill.
Representative Volstead believes
that the clear intent of the act has
not been carried out by the secretary
of the interior, and says that when

intended that whatever bonus might
exist from the sale of the swamp
lands should go to the respective
counties where the lands are situated
to reimburse them for the drainage
bonds issued. He is to introduce the
proposed amendment.

DEMOCRAT VOTE
HEAVIEST KNOWN
Less Than Half of Minnesota Repub
licans Cast Ballots at
Primaries.
While less than tfke-feaM of the
Minnesota Republicans voted in the
primary election held last Tuesday,
the Democrat vote in the presidential
primary was the largest vote ever
cast by that party in a nominating
contest. Indications are that more
than 50,000 voted Democratic tickets
while the Republican vote is not like
ly to show over 75,000, less than
one-half of the usual turnout.
Larson is Fourth.
With only 130 small precincts to
report the Republican vote is as fol
lows:
Cummins, 50,357 Estabrook, 9,-
844.
Eberhart, 47,760 Jacobson, 35,-
867 M. Johnson, 19,734 Larson,
24,840 Manahan, 23,915 Rahn, 18,-
127 Stevens, 18,461 Van Sant, 35,-
979.
Lawler Leads.
Democratic totals for 63 counties
show the Democratic race as follows:
Lawler, 33,889 King, 24,392
Nelson, 23,486 Austin, 20,992 Rei
ter, 20,427 Wessel, 20,477 Just,
19,470 Weiss, 20,898.
The Democratic vote totals 184,-
031. Allowing that each Democratic
voter marked four ballots, this would
mean 46,008 Democratic votes cast.
Undoubtedly many marked less than
four names and allowing for more
than 100 precincts yet to report, it
is evident that over 50,000 Demo
cratic votes were cast.
Donohue Chosen.
The results in the Sixth district
are as follows:
Sixth district, 261 precincts. Re
publicans: C. A. Allbright, 3,262

PARDON ASKED FOR
SLAYER OF HENRY
KEHRING OF RENA
William E. Codington in Stillwater
Prison to Make New Effort for
Liberty.
SELF DEFENSE WILL
BE PLEA AT HEARING
Neighbors Who Heard Kehring
Threaten Life of Convict Will
Testify.
A famous tragedy, a homicide at
for which William E. Codding
ton has been locked up in the Still
water prison for the last 12 years,
will be rehearsed before the state
board of pardons at that body's April
meeting in support of Coddington's
for freedom. He is now serving
life sentence for murder in the first
degree.
Killed in 1903.
Coddington killed Henry Kehring
Bena, August 4, 1903. Nobody
witnessed the tragedy. Coddington's
plea was self defense and neighbors
of the men testified to specific threats
to kill Coddington that had been
made by Kehring.
And Kehring was killed while he
held a loaded pistol in his hand. Up
on this evidence Coddington's friends
rest their plea for a pardon.
Spooner is Judge.
This feud of the north woods start
ed in a quarrel over $10. Accord
ing to the testimony taken at the
trial of Coddington before District
Judge Marshall A Spooner of Be
midji at Grand Rapids in December,
1903, Coddington was with several
other settlers, raising a cabin for a
neighbor on Aug. 3, 1903 when Kehr
ing suddenly appeared among them
with a rifle in his arm and a pistol
on his hip. He called Coddington a
thief, the witness said, cursed him
and said he would kill him. As Cod
dington backed away, Kehring fol
lowed, drew his revolver and pressed
it against Coddington's body.
Too surprised to move, the other
members-of the-party stood" spelt
bound while all this was taking
place.
"I will kill you tonight," Kehring
finally said, according to the wit
nesses, as he walked away.
That night Coddington and James
Myers drove in a buckboard past Keh
ring's place. Kehring, according to
both, rushed out waving a pistol.
They whipped up their horse and left
him far behind Next day Codding
ton, while at Vance's postoffice in
Itasca county, was advised to havfr
Kehring placed under bonds to keep
the peace. The advice seemed good
and he started home to dress for the
journey to the county seat.
Claims Attack.
As Coddington drove along the
road his rifle lay across his knee. Ac
cording to Coddington's story, he was
half way across the Kehring clearing
when he heard Kehring tearing along
through the brush, his dog barking
at his heels.
"I've got you now," Kehring shout
ed, according to Coddington. Cod
dington's horse, frightened, bolted
and collided with a stump. Codding
ton was thrown to the ground, still
grasping his rifle, he said.
Reports Tragedy.
When he looked up, he said, he
saw Kehring, who was only 50 feet
distant, coming rapidly toward him
and aiming a pistol at him. Codding
ton said he moved rapidly away from
his approaching foeman, firing his
rifle as_he retreated, and that at the
third shot Kehring dropped.
Coddington himself reported the
tragedy to the sheriff of the county
and that official led a party that
found the body, the pistol the cart
ridges as Coddington has described
them and even found a wheel mark
on a stump to verify Coddington's
story of the frightened horse.
Miss Hanna Hoffman, teacher of
Red Lake school, after spending a
few days visiting with friends in Be
midji, returned Saturday afternoon to
Red Lake.
