"One Sunday I secured evidence of

could be arranged for the sailors to
plead guilty and get suspended sen

MYes, he said nothing to me until I
took it up with him. Then he assent

States His Attitude
Henry J. Lyman of the Island of

against an instructed delegation.
His personal, preference is for Col.
Theodore Roosevelt as the Republi

frankly willing to, subordinate this
preference if the interests of Hawaii
can be better served by the support of
some other man.
Mr. Lyman's . views are succinctly
set forth in the following letter to the
public through the Star-Bulletin: . f

of the Kwangsi troops, won a decisive
victory in Kuchau. defeating a. strong
division sent out from Canton.
. A late report states that Lum Ling

the . revolutionary leader has ' des
patched a messenger to Canton asking
the military governor to join the rev
