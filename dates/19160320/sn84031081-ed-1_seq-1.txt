of forty-two hours, which would

pedition today received information

I he object of the chase. Disposition of
the troops began tonight for the task
of hunting him down. Meanwhile,
Villa was reported to be continuing
his outrages upon Americans.
The expedition reach",! (name de
leted by censor). They were informed
that the Mexican leader had passed
through this plao only a few days
ago. The latest Information of Villa's
priscm whereabouts placed him on
the ranch of Candclario Hernandez,
one
ot the jnih-chlefs with him on the;..
raid against Columbus
Clen. John J. Pershing personally led
the flying column in th" 100-mile,
dash. Every man in his command was!
mounted. They prosed through a scc-f
lion of -Mexico where water was;
scarce. For such a large body of men j
the speed maintained wus remarkable,;
and the good condition in which they;

Only a few cavalry horses and pack j

the Aitierlcan colonies in the Vicinity
of his mountain retreats and that he
had killed residents of these colonies.
The location of Villa's latest hiding
place, Canderlio Hernandez' ranch,
was not clear tonight, nor did the
dispatch passed by the military cen
sor reveal the places where the Am
erican colonies, which Villa was re- j
ported raiding, ure situated. The ,
ranch was understood to be on the;
properties of Luis Tcrrazas, the mul- ;
ti-millionalre land owner, whoso
properties Villa had been confiscating'
and distributing while he held Luis j
Terrazas, Jr., for more than a year, ;
squeezing- millions in valuable prop- ;
erty from the Terrazas family bv I
threats of killing the son. The seized j
Terrazas properties arc scattered over ;
more than half of the. state of Chi-j
huoltua, so that the Hernandez ranch :
might be one hundred miles or more j
from Oeneral Pershing's outposts. j
From thirty-five to forty mile;
south and also southwest of the fa- :
sas Oruiides region, where last night's j
report placed the American troops ,
there are numerous American Mor-
iwiii settlements, but it had been be- i
licved here that the Americans nil !
had left these towns.
The loss of some horses and mul" j
by General Pershing's squadron is '
not considered unusual for such n I
march. The bandits whom the Am- I
ertcans are pursuing spent tne irves;(!mi ,fl bf t,ml,ggled

These unshod horses are wild to

ed that when they have no food their
riders give them a bunch of cactus.
A saying of this country is that "a
Mexican pony supper consists of a
cactus plant and a blow on the head
with a hammer to keep him quiet for

While the ' Carranra leaders and

have succeeded m far In uvoidlng uny
friction, there Is one serious question
which may arise at any time to
threaten t tie entire situation. As the.
lines of communication of the Am

bringing up supplies becomes IncteiH
Ingly more pressing. It Is expected
here that Washington will sooner or

roads, If such a request has not al

mission would undoubtedly be a stp
bound to he misconstrued by man-'
Mexicans. On the other hand a r
fusal would scarcely harmonize Wi
the professed desire of the Carran

The arrival of this crisis is being an
lously awaited on l.ith sides of the.
