CARRANZA PROTESTS
Mentions Incident at Casas
Grandes America Ac
cedes to Wishes.
El Paso, March 20. Villa
has doubled east and south
to Namiquipa, according to a
telegram received here by
General Gavira at Juarez.
He reports that Carranza
troops are advancing from
the south while the Ameri
cans are continuing their
march from the north in an
effort to close the net around
the bandit.
After leaving El Valle, where he
had abandoned 30 of his wounded,
Villa turned directly west to San
Miguel Babricora, said Gavira,
who explained that lie had learned
the Babricora, where Villa was re
ported yesterday, was San Miguel
Babricora, and not the Babricora
near the lake of that name, some
miles further to the south on Mrs.
Phoebe Hearst's ranch. San Mig
uel Babricora is about 20 miles
west of El Valle. From that point
Villa made a sudden twist and
struck toward 'aniliuipa, 40
miles south.
El Paso, Texas, March 20,
Carranza troops stationed at
Casas Grandes and other points
of that section at the time General
Pershing began his march Into
.Mexico, now are located at Ju
arez, opposite EI Paso and in the
rear of General Pershing's col
umns, it was authoritatively stat- ;
ed today. reason has been as
signed for the transfer of troops
from points inland to the border.
From reliable sources it Is stated
also that in one instance a Car
ranza detachment allowed Villa
to pass southward on receipt of
a message from the bandit leader
that he was not warring against
Mexico.
Washington, March 20. General
Carranza has formally protested
against American troops occupying
Casas Grandes in their pursuit of Villa
and the American government has re
plied that the troops have been or
dered especially not to occupy Casas
Grandes or any other towns or cities
in Mexico.
The protest and reply were included
in an exchange of notes between act
ing Secretary Polk of the state de
partment and Eliseo Arredondo,
ambassador designated to the United
States from Mexico.
After a conference early today be
tween President Wilson and Mr.
Polk it became known that Mr. Polk
In a note forwarded to Mexico yes
terday said instructions had been lent
to General Funston to keep his troops
away from all towns.
The state department today had not
received a reply from the request
6ent to Carranza for the use of Mex
ican railroads in transporting sup
plies to the expeditionary force.
Ia urging the use of Mexican rail
roads for that purpose It has been
pointed out to the Carranza govern
ment that similar permission was
granted Carranza troops for the use
, of railroads in the United States last
' year.
Realize Carranza's Position.
The administration realizes fully
the difficulty of General Carranza's
Position, because of feeling in Mex
ico, for that reason, every effort is
being made by the state department
to disseminate in Mexico the Infor
mation that the United States had no
motives of aggression In sending
troops across the border. Following
out the same policy the American
troops now in Mexico have been giv
en instructions to be careful in deal
lugs with Mexicans generally. All acts
'hlch might be construed as offen
sive to the Mexican population are
to be avoided.
Generally, reports from Mexico to-
Gay were optimistic In character.
General Carranza, it was learned
today, had been urged by some of his
closest advisors to offer a large re
gard for the apprehension of Villa,
Batter Down
Party Lines
on Army Bill
Washington, March 20. The house
today resumed consideration of the
Hay army reorganization bill under a '
standing rule which allows each mem
ber five minutes' debate after general
debate has closed. Its passage by
Thursday at the latest Is virtually
assured.
Representative Kahn's amendment
to the house army bill to make the
peace strength of the army at 220,000
men instead of 140,000 was taken up
for two hours' debate today when the
house resumed work on the measure.
As the amendment would bring the
house bill up to the proposals of the
senate bill, a vote was regarded as a
test on the disposition of the house to
agree with the larger proposals of the
senate.
The two hours' debate was divided
equally between those who favor and
those who oppose the increase. Party
lines were broken down In the debate.
Representative Caldwell, democrat of
New York, supported the increase.
"The passage of the bill, without the
amendment, would be ridiculous, if
not pathetic," he said. "Today in
Mexico we witness a skeleton army
fighting with an army of skeletons."
Representative Towner, republican
of Iowa, opposed the proposal, and
Representative Greene, republican ot
Vermont, supported it. Representa
tive Anthony, republican of Kansas,
and Representative Dyer, republican
of Missouri, opposed the amendment.
MORE TIME GRANTED
TO ARGO STRIKERS
Chicago, March 20. Extension of
time in which they might return to
work was granted today to the strik
ers at the Corn Products Refining
company plant at Argo by F. L. Jef
fries, superintendent of the company.
"The men now on 6trike will be per
mitted to return to work any time
this week and they will receive the
benefit of the company seniority ad
vancement, which is equlvaIcaitQan
increase of 2 cents an hour," said
Mr. Jeffries. "Meantime no strike
breakers will be brought here."
THE WAR
TODAY
The Russians haTe started an
offensive movement of large pro
portions against the Germans on
the eastern front, while the battle
around Verdun between the
French and Germans has slacken
ed somewhat.
Berlin reports that a violent at
tack around Driswiaty lake and
Lake Xarocz was repulsed and
the Rossians left 9,270 dead on
the field.
Air raids were numerous yes
terday. Four German seaplanes
dropped bombs on the east coast
of England, near Dover, Rams
gate and Westgate, killing at least
nine persons and wounding 81.
One of the seaplanes was brought
down 80 miles at sea by a pursu
ing British aviator, who killed the
German observer.
Five French aircraft dropped
bombs on Mete, ammunition near
Salines and the aerdrome at
DIeuze, while 25 others attacked
the aviation camps at Habsheim
and the freight station at Mul
hausen. In battles In the air
which followed the Germans and
French each lost three or four
machines. A German airship at
tacked the entente allied fleet
south of Saloniki but with what
result is not known.
A Teutonic submarine sent the
French torpedo boat destroyer
Renandin to the bottom In the
Adriatic, three officers and 44
men being lost. An Aus
trian hospital ship was sunk
by an entente submarine. The
Germans report the recapture of
some ground from ' the British
northeast of Vermelles In the
region of Lake La Bassee.
A notable air raid was carried
out early today on the German
seaplane station at Zeebrugge,
Belgium, by 65 allied machines.
The British official announcement
declares that considerable dam
age appeared to have been done
by the bombs dropped.
Fighting about Verdun lias
again slackened, according to to
day's Paris statement
There Is renewed activity in the
Balkans, north of Saloniki, a
French column having advanced
from the entrenched camp and
occupied villages near the Greek
border, which Teutonic and Bul
garian forces had entered.
A war conference of probable
momentous Importance Is about
to open In Paris. The Joint pol
icies to be pursued by the entente
in the next period of the war
will be decided upon, i
RAILWAYS IN
MEXICO NEED
OF SOLDIERS
Problem of Adequate Means
for Handling Expedition
Grows Grave.
AMERICA IN REQUEST
United States Asks Carranza
for the Use of Mexican
Railroads.
Washington, March 20. General
Carranza today replied to the
American government's request
for nse of Mexican railroad lines
for movement of supplies to the
punitive expedition, with a request
for more complete Information of
exactly what the war department
wants. General Carranza's reply
was sent to President Wilson.
The information he asks will be
furnished.
El Paso, Texas, March 20. The
railroad problem overshadowed every
thing else here in the Mexican situa
tion today. The reply of General Car
ranza to the request of the United
States government for permission to
use the railroads, was expected to be
sent forward to Washington today. A
refusal will embarrass the operations
of the American troops while the
granting of the request will probably
be seriously construed by a consider
able section of the Mexican people.
The unexpectedly rapid advance of
the expeditionary columns under Gen
eral Pershing has forced the railroad
question to an issue. Americans fa
miliar with the country Into which the
columns are now entering assert that
the use of the railroads for bringing
up supplies is absolutely necessary.
Speedy Transportation Seeded.
Dr. I. J. Bush, formerly chief sur
geon of Madero's army, asserted today
that the speedy transportation facili
ties were essential to further progress
by the American soldiers. "The terri
tory in which Villa probably will re
main," said Dr. Bush, "is embraced in
an imaginary line between Chihuahua
and Minaca, with the Mexican Central
railroad on one side and the Sierra
Madre on the other. His soldiers
have the advantage over the Ameri
cans in that they will travel light with
only a few days provisions."
Demands Reopening of Mines.
Another serious situation has been
caused by the action of General Callas,
military governor of Sonora, in de
manding that the La Colorado Mining
company of New York reopen their
mine at Hermosillo at once. General
Calles has wired the New York offices
of the company that if the mine is not
reopened immediately he will take It
over and run it.
The property is said to be a very
rich gold mine and formerly employ
ed 1,000 Mexicans, according to Gen
eral Calles. He declared today that he
had no intention of confiscating the
mine but that the Mexicans were suf
fering through being thrown out of
employment and that he intended to
put them back to work. The governor
said that the La Colorado company
was the only one that had suspended
operations in Senora and that there
was not reason for their action as he
could and would give them ample pro
tection. Mountain Roads Perilous.
A shallow river and a winding
wagon road, cutting like the two
blades ot a pair of scissors through
the heart of the Sierra Madre Oriental
mountains, today are the connecting
link between Franciso Villa's retreat
ing command and the pursuing col
umns of Brigadier General John J.
Pershing, if latest reports regarding
the positions of the contending forces
are correct.
According to Colonel BertanI, Car
ranza commander at Casas Grandes,

Belgian City
London, March 20 Sixty-five allied
aeroplanes today bombarded the Bel
gian coast town of Zeebrugge. All re
turned. The following official statement was
made:
"In the early hours of this morning
a combined force of approximately
fifty British, French and Belgian aero
planes and seaplanes, accompanied by
15 fighting machines, left and attacked
the German seaplane station at Zee
brugge and the aerodrome and Hout
tave near Zeebrugge.

have been done. The machines on the
average carried 200 pounds of bombs.
All machines returned safely.
"One Belgian officer is reported ser
iously wounded.
"All the British machines referred
to were naval."
Zeebrugge Is on the Belgian coast
12 miles northeast of Ostend. Since
the German occupation this port has
become of considerable importance,
particularly as a German submarine
base. It is one of the principal points
from wrhich submarine operations in

LORIMER LAWYER
OPENSJIS PLEA
Attorney Declares Defendant Had
Nothing to Do With the Loaning
of Bank's Money.
Chicago, March 20. William Lorl-
mer, on trial in connection with the
failure of the La Salle Street Trust
and Savings Bank had, according to
the opening statement of the defense
made today by Attorney Albert Kink,
"absolutely nothing to do with the
loaning of the bank's money," between
April, 1910, and July, 1912. At that
time, Mr. Fink said, Mr. Lorlmer was
too busy with his fight to retain his
seat in the senate, to take part in the
management of the bank, other than
to preside at its directors' meeting.
Mr. Fink brought out other points
on which the defense will be based.
Two of the indictments charge that
Mr. Lorimer received deposits after
the bank was insolvent and the de
fense, said the attorney, will challenge
the state to show that the institution
was insolvent when it closed in 1914
and will try to show tha tthe officials
had no reason to believe that it was
insolvent.
Mr. Fink also discussed the refusal
of the Chicago clearing house associa
tion to admit the LaSalle Street bank.
