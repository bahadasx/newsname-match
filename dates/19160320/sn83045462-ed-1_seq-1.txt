THOMAS TAGGART.
INDIANAPOLIS, Intl., March 20.Thomas
Taggart, democratic* nationa
i- committeeman, was appointed Unite
}f States senator by Gov. Ralston toda,
to fill the vacancy caused by the deat
n of Senator Benjamin F. Shively.
r Mr. Taggart was handed his com mis
.. sion as United States senator at a loca
hotel shortly after he had arrived fror
French Lick.
*e lie declined to say whether he woul
be a candidate for the nomination fo
United States senator at the state con
vention next month, as. under th* ap
>f pointment. he will serve only until th
election n*xt November.
"I think." said Mr. Taggart. "that
0 had better qualify for this job befor
>* I set out to land another. It will no
take me Ions: to deride whether J glial
ie go before the staJe convention, afte
I have been sworn in."
Me said he did not know when h<
would leave for Washington.
"In my humble way." the new sen
ator continued. "I shall do all I cai
>- to support the policies of the I'resi
dent."
,s There were a number of democrati
>f leaders of the state gathered at th
v hotel when Mr. Taggart arrived.
The new senator has been prominen
in politics in Indiana for twenty-flv
years and has maintained the leader
r>- ship of the democratic party in In
?d diana practically all of that time. Th
id only offices Mr. Taggart has ever heh
were auditor of this (Marion) count
le for two terms and three times mayo
i- of Indianapolis.
Praised by the Governor.
After Gov. Ralston signed Mr. Tag
gart's commission he wrote him a let
jr ter saying it afforded him gcnuin
pleasure to appoint him United State
senator.
id "You have long and faithfully serve
p" your party," said Gov. Ralston, "a
*s great personal sacrifice to yourseli
p. both in labor and money. If the demo
>y cratic party has been sound in its plat
form declarations during the las
>n twenty-five years, then you have bee
o- sound in your advocacy of politfca
,i- policy, for without hope of persona
ht preferment or reward .you have cham
ie pined the cause of your party with
st dauntless courage and an inspirini
optimism.
"Your services as a public offlcia
have been characterized with marke
efficiency and the strictest integrity
While you have been, at times, severe
ly criticised by some within and som
y without your party, no responsible ma
has ever laid the betrayal of trus
against you.
ro "I know you will go forth to the dis
charge of your new duties firmly re
n solved to support the administration o
s- President Wilson and to preserve th
R. honor and dignity of our state and na
' tion."
nt
" Vice President Indorses Taggart.
I _ Vice President Marshall, discussin
the appointment of Mr. Taggart a
c_ senator from Indiana to succeed th
late Senator Shively until a senate
r>m can be elected, said, today:
i- "With due deference to all other ear
didates, no one acquainted with li
diana politics would have expected Go
Kalston to name any one else than M
- Taggart. The senators will find him t
be an agreeable and charming mai
n and one, from his public utterances, i
r- accord with the President. tie is ni
an orator. He will not be able to di?
ir cuss questions as did Senator Shiver
4M but he can vote a straight democrati
vote."
"" Views of the President's Friends.
Some of President Wilson's closes
friends l?elieve. Atey said today, tha
the appointment of Mr. Taggart a
Tinted States senator lrom Indiana wi
have a bad effect upon the President'
chances of carrying thai stale in Nc
vember next and will hurt ihe part
generally there. If is admitted by som
?.f these critics that Taggart is popula
among oeuevers in party organ izauo
and machine methods. Of all men in th
country he stands for organization an
the uses lo which ?t ran he put. but i
Is claimed that Indiana ha* often show
resentment at the |k>1Ih to any ma
wearing the Taggart label, and aa
whole will not relish the honor that ha
been conferred^>n him by Gov. Kalstot
Conflicting Opinions.
The White House officials today d?

were disposed to regard it as goo
politics, while others, especially thos
familiar with conditions in Indian:
felt that the selection would hurt a

" T'artv lines were broken down a* de

Representative Caldwell, democrat, of
New York supported the increase.
e "The passage of this bill without the
amendment would be ridiculous, if not
* pathetic," he said. "Today in Mexico we j
^ witness a skeleton army fighting an army
1 of skeletons."
r Representative Towner, republican,

Greene, republican, of Ver
mont supported it. Representative
i Anthony, republican, of Kansas and j

c
? Cites Armies of Smaller Countries.
t Representative Gardner, republican, of
e Massachusetts, read the list of members
" of the military committee and pointed
e out that all the democrats here In the
last Congress voted for a little navy. The
* Hay bill, he said, was a surrender by the
pacific element, since it produced an
army of only 140.000 regulars.

"mountain has produced a ridiculous

d Representative Crago. republican, of
t Pennsylvania, favored the amendment.
. saying that the men might be ob- ]
r* tained now. and to raise a force to
220,000 would postpone any call for vol- (

committee to report the bill favorL'
ably, but with the privilege of amend- '
ing on the floor, was unique. He said I
a the President, Secretary Garrison, Gen.

if much enthusiasm by their different 1
e views on the amendment. Applause.
~ cries of "Whoopee!" and "Amen!" fre- 1
quently interrupted them. !
Mr. Madden urged that even 220,000 i
men in the standing army were not i
K enough in time of peace. In time of j i
s | war. he declared, a million or two mile
! lion men would not be too many
" "The people have been led to believe ,
that Congress would pass prepared- i
ness legislation," he said. "They will
i- not be satisfied with a half measure,
v. and the Hay bill as it stands is not .
a quarter measure."
Representative McKenzie criticised Mr.
o Cardner and other republicans who supn,
i?orted the proposed amendment for not
' striving to increase the army during the ?
sixteen years that their party was in
power prior to the Wilson administration.
i. During all that period, he said, they
. never lifted their voices in behalf of
' such a move. Tumultuous applause from
the democratic side greeted the statement.
Representatives Snyder, republican, j
of New York, and Olney, democrat, of :
a Massachusetts, also spoke for the j
amendment. Representative Campbell,
republican, of Kansas, opposed it.

Advance Forces the Issue.
The unexpectedly rapid advance of
ic expeditionary columns under Gen.
ersliitig has forced the railroad queson
to an issue. Americans familiar
ith the country into which the colmiis
are now entering assert that it i*?

In*. I. J. Rush. former I \ chief surpon

were essential to further progiess

"The American forces are reported at

The valley converges here into

Villa Spreading False Reports.
Dr Hush said that he had no doubt
iat Villa was spreading stories of his
onderful victories over the Atnenuis.
of how he had captured Texas,
id that Carranza had gone'over to the
nited States. It would he easy, 1a*

Another serious situation has been
used by the action of (Jen. Calles, iniliry
governor of Sonora. in demanding

according to (Jen. Calles. He deired
today that he had no intention
confiscating the mine, but that the
ixicans were suffering through being
town out of employment, and that he
ended to put them back to work.
Phe governor said that the La Coloraad
