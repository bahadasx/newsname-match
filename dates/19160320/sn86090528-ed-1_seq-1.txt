In the course of his remarks, In ad
dressing the members of the commit
tee. Alacr Melton, in referring to the
new eletticn law as enacted by the re
cent session of the legislature, said:
"There has been much criticism of
the registration- law. This criticism
comes from either those who do not
understand It. or from those who pur
posely misconstrue Its provisions, be
cause tbey can never, at any time or
under any circumstances, see any good
In Democratic legislation.
' "Tho main purposes of this law are
to insure honest and fair elections
fhoth primary and general, by making
it particularly impossible for persons
who are not qualified electors to
Vote at any election In tho state and
ro regulate the registration
ot
olers that the Democratic nominees
wil lbe nominated by Democrats an!
the Republican nominees by Repub
licans. "A person who is not registered
can not vot, and if a person is regis
tered as a Democrat, he can vote no
ticket in the primary election except
the, ticket for Democratic nominees.
The same applies to Republicans and
Socialists they will not be permit
ted to vote In tho primary elections
the Democratic ballot, nor for persons
who are candidates for nomination, to
office on the Democratic ticket.
"The duty of precinct registrars, un
der the act, Is to see that every quali
fied voters in his precinct is register
ed. It Is the duty cf the voter to regis,
ter and it Is the duty of the registrar
to see th-tt the voter Is registered
Registrars should make special effort
to register every qualified voter The
question is not whether a person Is
a Democrat, Republican, Socialist or
Independent, tout the question with the
registrar should be whether the per.
eon is a qualified elector, and if so the
registrar should see thai he is regis
tered, regardless of politics.
"In appointing pre:inet registrars,
men thould be secured who will sev.
that every voter in hia precinct regis
ters under this law. When a voter
registers end continues to reside in
his precinct and does not change his
politics he never registers again. His
original certificate remains good.
"In my opinion, when the people
understand the provisions of this reg
istration system it will foe the most
popular legislation ever enacted in
this state."

expressed in the compositions of
the different composers and his skill
in representing their ideas to the

It was. on a quiet Saturday that the
Grady county cohorts of the Harris
and McGraw clans assembled at th
city hall in Chiekasha. The roller first
began to puff when the signs wers
nailed on the doors of the council
chamber and the mayor's office, on the
first floor, announcing that in the for
mer were the headquarters of the Har
ris faction and in the latter the like,
wise of the of McGraw.
"To Tophat with headquarters,"'
mid tho McGraw clan, "let's get busy."
And busy they got. In ones and twos
and sixes and sevens until about fifty,
including the clans of "oth the Harris
and the McGraw, one Democratic post,
master, one Democratic reporter and
one solitary unbleached American had
assembled.
Just as the clock was. on the stroke
of 1:5.', Judge Hamilton and W. W.
