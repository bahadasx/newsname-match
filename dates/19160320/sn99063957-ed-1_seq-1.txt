I Tinted Press staff correspondent.)
td 1'aso, Texas, Mar. 2(1. Reported
hemmed ill among the canyons of the
iuenere mountains, Francisco Villa
was believed to be surrounded today by
several C'arranzista columns and" the
American expedition closing down on
him from the north. There are manv
square miles of mountain nnd desert hi
side the net, however, and his escape is
considered likely.
Aeroplanes may be used tu spy out
Villa's hiding dace! Soaring over the
peaks, they could pick him out below
and wignnl his location to General J. J.
Pershing's scouts.
Villa is reported to have left a de
tachment at the Hernandez ranch to
hold off the American cavalry until he
has a chance to hide in the Sierra Ma
"Ires. Fighting between Americans and
this Villista rear guard is expected
daily. Americans, watching corn fed
horses against tireless ponies, have
made forced marches in an effort to
overhaul 1 1 la and make him fight. In
that move lay the first hope of cap
ture. '
With the expedition penetrating into
a barren interior country which nialv
the usual method 01 provisioning nn
army by automobile impractical, it was
reported Washington had made a sec
ond request for immediate permission
to use the Mexico Northwestern rail
road for military purposes.
May Seize Railroad.
. A sensational rmor was current that
American troops would give the Juarez
garrison IS minutes to surrender, and
then seize the town ami control the rail
road terminus there i'f permission to use
the line were refused.
General Garcia believes that Carran
zn will probably grant the required
privilege. He repented his assurances
that Cnrranza wanted to co-operate
with the Americans in everv wav pos
sible. Cnrranzistns soldiers are, in fact, at
tempting to drive Villa toward the
(leurrero district. Troops from Chihua
hua City, Guzman and Numiquipa arc
closing in on him. The American van
guard is crowding him from the north
while his retreat across the Sierra Ma
il res toward Sunora is believed cut off
by eonstitiitionalist forces gunrding all
passes.
Pacing a certain fight if Villa is over
taken, General Pershing ami Colonel
Dodd led their columns over 100 miles
of foreign country without a single sol
dier killed. A few horses nnd mules
perished from effects of their terrible
trials nn the sesert.

is the sensational charge upon which
several members of the legralature and
cabinet officers will shortly go to
trial.
Most of the roads reported built were
"north of Fifty-three" across bliz

Tho phantom roads are in a territory
which has never been surveyed and cir
cumvent the laws of man, whose river
banks are precipitous and where dog

that would defy German 42 centimeter
guns to dislodge.
One report of the investigntors rends:
"That is not all. The contractor is
not there, nor here, nor anywhere else;
he simply does not exist; he's a phan

tree and killed. His wife and little
daughter were only slightly injured.
Lightening struck several houses, do

Douglas. Ariz., Mar. 20. Following
unconfirmed reports reaching Agusi
Priota that Francisco Villa was headed
toward Sonora, Consul Ives Le Lcvier,
rtpenking for De Facto Governor Calles,
doclarcd Villa would meet with a warm
welcome.
"There nre 2",000 de facto troopn
waiting 'Pancho' Villa in Sonora,"
ho said. "Villa met his Waterloo in
Sonora, it will be remembered, losing
a big army, all his artillery and was
forced to become a bandit."

Colonel Fierro are. preparing to leave-

listas would have to pass to reacn Hon
ors state. Tho Indians will travel
light and aro equipped to make great
speed over the rough mountainous coun
try.
Apparently trusting the Carranzistaj
to guard the Konora-Chihuahiia line, tha
United States troops hern made no
move as a result of Auga Pricta infor
mation. In an interview granted tho United
Press today, General Flias I'. Calles,
military governor of Sonora, declared
tii.it his orders are to co-operate witll
American troops in case an invasion la
to Sonora is made necessary.
Says Mexico 19 At Peace.
Calles officially discredited all re
ports of mutiny and insubordination on
tho part of the soldiers under his com
mand. When asked if the capture of Villa
and his band would result in "peace in
Mexico," General Calles, somewhat sur
prised, replied through his interpreter
that there is already peace in Mexico
and has been since the recognition ot
Carrnnza.
Villa, he said, is nn outlaw, a thief,
and so aro his followers. If it is the
impression in some parts of the United
Sttacs that Villa is a patriot and th
friend of the poorer classes in Mexico,
then the Americans are misinformed.
Villa is a bandit nnd is being treated
as such.
