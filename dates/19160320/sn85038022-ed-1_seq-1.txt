dropped down, nnd of course foil Just
where It would he the means of doing
tho most dnmnge.
In consequence twenty carloads of
coal plied up on ends, sldcwnys, cross
.ways and every other wny, tearing up
the track nnd playing smash In gen
eral, completely blocking traffic.
Train Ho. 2, eastbound. nnd train
No. 3, westbound, wero detourcd over

It wns a costly stunt for tho road,
and the only redeeming feature was
