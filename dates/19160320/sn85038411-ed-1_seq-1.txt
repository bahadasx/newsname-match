allowed \ ilia to pass southward

By Associated Press
iOI Paso. Texas, March 20. —The
problem of granting the United States
government permission to use Mesican
railways to transport supplies to
American troops pursuing Francisco
Villa overshadowed everything else in
the Mexican situation here to-day.
The reply of General Carran-a to
the request of the government for per
mission to use the railroads was ex
pected to be sent forward to Washing
ton to-day. A refusal will embarrass
i he operations of the American troops,
while the granting of the request, it
was declared, would be bound to be
seriously misconstrued by a consid
erable section of the Mexican people
and to be exploited by the enemies of
General Carranza
The unexpectedly rapid advance of
i he expeditionary columns under Gen
eral Pershing has forced the railroad
question to an issue. Americans
familiar with the country into which
the columns are now entering assert
that it is imperative that the railroads
be placed at their disposal for the
bringing up of supplies. Dr. 1. J. Bush,
formerly chief surgeon of Madero's
army, asserted to-day that the speedy
transportation facilities were essential
IO further progress by the American
soldiers.
The American force* ure reported
Ht Galeana.
■Mexicans Have Advantage
"Twenty miles south of there is El
Valle and from that point the only
practicable way of bringing up sup
plies is by railroad," said Dr. Bush.
"The valley converges here into a
narrow deep gorge in which about 2,-
000 people live. The territory in which
Villa probably will remain is em
braced by an imaginary line between
Chihuahua and Minaca with the
Mexican Central Railroad on one side
ind the Sierra Madre on the other.
His soldiers have the advantage over
'lie Americans in that they will travel
light with only a few days' provisions
ind are seasoned men. well able to
stand the hardships of mountain cam
paigning in that climate."
Dr. Bush said that lie had no doubt
hat Villa was spreading stories of his
wonderful victories over the Amer
icans of how he had captured Texas
and that Carranza had gone over to
Ihe t'nited States. It would be easy,
he said, for him to make the ignorant
peons, among whom he is operating,
believe the wildest stories.
A shallow river and a winding wagon
road, cutting like the two blades of a
pair of scissors through the heart of
i he Sierra Madre Oriental mountains,
10-day are the connecting link between
Francisco Villa's retreating command
and Hie pursuing columns of Hrlgadier-
General John J. Pershing, if latest re
