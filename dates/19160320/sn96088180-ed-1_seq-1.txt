I Wishes of the de facto government

If Carransa deems it inadvisable
for Americans to use Mexican rall-

El Paso, Mar, 20. Indications to
day pointed to a long pursuit of
Franolsoo Villa tar Into Mexico, and
the problem ot supplying the Ameri
can expedition with food and muni
tions was uppermost In the minds of
army men.
A few considered that withdrawal
ot the expedition without capturing
Villa was likely as an alternative to
forcibly taking Mexican railroads,
dofylng Vcnustlano Cnrranra, and
possibly presaging actual Interven
tion, with a year's bloody warfare
against all factions. ' .,.:

With the expedition penetrating
into a barren Interior country, which
makes the usual method of provi
sioning an army by automobile Im
practicable, It was reported Washing
ton had made a second request for
Immediate permission to - use the
Northwestern railroad for military
purposes, . ..
A sensational rumor was current
that American troops would give the
Juarez garrison 15 minutes to sur
render, and then seize the town and
contro) the railroad terminus there
if permission to use the line were
refused. , ,
Given Garcia believes that Car
ransa will probably grant the re
quired permission. He repeated his
assurances that Carranza wanted to
co-operate with the Americans In

There were renewed reports today
that Villa is heading Into the moun
tains .. ot Durango, ., He was born
there. VUltstas under the command
ot Generals Calltos, Contreras and
Reyes, with the remnants ot the
forces under General Urbinos and
General Agumedo, are lurking there.
Villa is reported In the Chihuahua
mountains, riding toward Durango.
To an expedition as large as Persh
ing's, the trails which Villa uses pre
sent an almost Impassable obstacle.
Colonel Dodd's cavalrymen are satd
,to be 60 miles behind Villa, but 60
miles means two days' marching in
those mountains.
Between Villa and his supposed
goal at Durango, however, are the
Tarahumar mountains, also one of
his favorite haunts, He Is approach
ing them today, and Is not yet out
of the Carranza trap. "'
When the pursuit extends below

pedition by wasrons will 'no longer

VILLA III SOIiORA
Douglas, Ariz., Mar. 20. -Twenty-
five thousand Mexican troops are
ready to strike within an boar's no
tice at the fleeing band of Vlllistas
should they head toward Sonora. In
an Interview granted the United Press
today, General Ellas P. Calles, mili
tary governor of Sonora, declared
that his orders are to co-operate with
American troops in esse an invasion
into Sonora is made necessary.
Calles officially discredited all re
ports ot mutiny and Insubordination
on the part of the soldiers under bis
command. '. - : .
Arrivals - from Nacozari this after
noon reported all quiet in the interior
of Sonora. Sunday bullfighting and
band concerts took place as though
normal times prevailed. There seem
ed to be little interest in the chase
for Villa. v :
J. R. Hyde returned to Portland
today, after spending a couple of
weeks here with relatives. ' Mrs.
Hyde will remain here another week.
I SCOUTS AHEAD
0F1S.T
San Antonio. Mar. 20. Dispatches
from General Pershing today, showed
he had left the main American expe
dition and gone west to assume com
mand ot Colonel Dodd's column.
Seven army aeroplanes are , again
scouting in the foothills south ot
Casas Grandes. Automobile trucks
carrying supplies and spare equip
ment follow the advancing soldiers.
Portions of the 13th cavalry and
the Fourth Held artillery are at Casas
Grandes, to support Pershing's troops
attempting to encircle the district
which supposedly affords conceal
ment to Villa. 1
General Funston said automobiles
could not chase Villa on the Casas
Grandes roads. They would be prac
tically worthless there, he declared.
If the Americans are permitted to
use Mexican railways, Funston stoted
that Casas Grandes would be the
American advance supply base. The
base at Columbus may be moved to
Casas Grandes. . ! '

llstas wore killed In the raid ot Col

London, Mar. 20. In retaliation
for Sunday's German air raid on the
Kentish coast, 60 allied aeroplanes
attacked Zeebrngge, Belgium, Teu
ton submarine base, and military'
works at Houltade, inflicting sever
damage with high-power bombs, it
was officially claimed at the war office
today. The great allied sky fleet car
ried 10,000 pounds of bombs. Each
machine bore missiles weighing a
total of 200 pounds. ' These wera
rained down on the seaplane atatloa
at Zeebrngge and on the aerodrome
at Houltade. Accompanying the
bomb throwers were 15 heavily arm
ed planes, which formed a protective
cordon around the small flyers as
they hurled fire and destruction on
the enemy. The admiralty announced
every machine returned home safely.
This is the first time that the allies
have retaliated Immediately after a
raid on England. It will be the Brit
ish policy every time hereafter.
Lord Derby is . reported to have
come to that decision soon after be

was recalled that Winston Churchill,
former first lord of the admiralty, re
cently declared that the only way to

IN THE NORTHWEST
Portland, Mar. 20. Soaring prices
ot metal, due to the enormous de
mand from Europe, has boomed min
ing operations throughout the Paci
fic northwest as never before.
The comparative value of the total
metal production of the state of Ore
gon for three years shows graphically
what the war demand has done.
These figures, according to H. M.
Parks, director . ot the Oregon bureau
ot mines and geology, are as fol
lows: 1814, 1750,000; 1915. $2,000,
000; 1916, $3,000,000 (estimated).
Old abandoned mines In many sec
tions hare been reopened vby capital
which saw in the higher metal prices
a chance to take advantage of the
European war. In many cases a little
development work In old mines has
revealed new ore bodies, the exist
ence ot which had hitherto not been
dreamed. '. ' ' '' ' . ' "; ' ' 1
In the bigger mining districts, like
the Couer d'Alene, the increase in
mining operations has been on a
gigantic scale, ibut the growth in
Oregon, heretofore comparatively
small In the mining Industry, shows
clearly what has been done by the
heavy demand. . i .
