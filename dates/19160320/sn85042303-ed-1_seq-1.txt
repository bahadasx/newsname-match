' General Gavira, the Carranza
commander at Juarez today.
He said the Carranza troops
were advancing from the south,

ed at Casas Grandes and other
j points in that section at the
' time that general Pershing be
j gan his march into Mexico are
ypw located at Juarez, opposite
''here in the rear of Pershing's
i columns. It is authoritatively
; stated today that no reason is
assigned for the transfer of the
troops from points inland to the
border.
j From reliable sources it is al
I so stated that in one instance a
j Carranza detachment allowed
; Villa to pass southward on re
ceipt of a message from the
bandit leader that he was not
j warring against Mexico.
Villa Declined Battle.
San Aiilonin, Tex., March 20. Villa
declined to offer resistance, to the
I'nited Slales troops today, accordimr
; to word ivce ivod by General Funston.
. These re ports offered little r ason for
j any belief t hat a clash would occur
' today or even tomorrow. It is assumed
at army headquarters here that the

Villa Spreading Stories.
; Kl I'aso, Tex., March 20. Dr. nush,

; has arrived here, says he does not
. doubt but that Villa is spreading stor
ies of wonderful victories over the
: Americans, of how lie captured Texas
f and that Carranza has gone to the
Vnited States. It would be easy, he
said, for Villa to make the ignorant
peons believe the wildest of these
i stories.
General Callep, governor of Sonora,
t today demanded that the I.a Colorado

roots, live oak hickory and other hard

Texas, may take the place of the

American smokers. IJeeause of the

briar root in France has been cur
tailed. A raise in price followed.
American manufacturers saw it was
necessary to meet the emergency, and
they immediately began experimenting
with home products, finding the dwarf

RAILROAD PROBLEM
Question of American Use of Rail
roads is Paramount in Mexico
Pefusal to Grcnt Permission Will
Hamper Work.
Kl I'aso, Tex., March 2'. The rail
road problem overshadowed every
thing els- here today in the Mexican
situation. :
Carranza's reply for permission to
use the railroad is expected to be
forwarded to Washington today, ltis
refusal will embarrass the operations
of the American troop:;, while the
granting of this permission will be
si riously misconstrued by a consid
erable number of the Mexican people.
"The American troops are reported
at Galeana," said Dr .1. J. Bush, for
merly chief surgeon of Madera's army
arriving here today.
Villa May Be Trapped.
EI Taso, Tex., March 20. Francisco
Villa has been driven into a trap by
the rapid advance of the American
troops, according to information re
ceived yesterday in wireless dispatch
es from the front and in telegraphic
dispatches to General Gabriel Gavira,
the Carranza commander at Juare:.
Everything seems nov.' to depend
upon the ability of the Carranza gp.r
risons to hold their end of the net.
On three sides the bandit chief is
hemmed in by strong Carranza col
umns, while on the fourth the Amer
icans are driving forward with amaz
ing speed.
Villa was reported in the Ilabicera
Lake region last night, on tho ranch
of Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, which he has
ravaged several times in tne pa-t.
Rabieora is about fifty-fiVo miles
south of Galeana, where one section
of the American expeditionary force
has arrived and is pushing forward at
the rate of thirty-three miles a day.
A few miles to the west of tho ban
dits' position is Xamiquipa, vhich is
held by a powerful Carranza garri
son. On the east aro the frowning
barriers of the Sierra Mat'.re moun
tains, barring the way to Sonira.
General Gutierrez, Carranza's: f.eld
chief, declares that he holds all the
passes to Sonora.
To the south, Villa's way is blocked
by the Carranza garrison at Madera,)
a town of considerable importance as i
tho headquarters of the Madera coni
nanv, limited, an American concern!
which has vast lumber, mining and
railroad interests. On account if the
importance of this town ft excep
tionally heavy Carranza forco is said
to hold it.
The whole situation seems to han:r
on the Carrancistas. If they .main
loyal to the first chief, which up to
the present they have shown every
indication of doing, Villa appears
trapped.
It is, of course, realized tha: he is
on ground of his own choosing and in
a country admirably suited for guer
illa warfare and surprise -ittacks.

When twenty-three allied aeroplanes

took place.
Accounts just reaching here declare

SEED IS MORE PLENTIFUL IN

"There are more seed peanuts in

people; thought," said Secretary West
of the Chamber of Commerce this
morning, hcii a.-hed where he was
Kiiinir to procure seed for the many
farmers who will plant them this sea
son. Investigation throughout the
county reveals the fact that nearly
all farmers who have Kiown them in
the past, have seed on hand, and are
prepared for this season. The secre
tary states, however, that over two
hundred farmers have made applica
tion for seed, and that he will be
compelled to order at least one car
load. Mr. West and Walter Colbert have
been very active in their campaign
to induce farmers to plant peanuts
in this section, and they believe the
acrca-re will he far in excess of their
first estimate.
