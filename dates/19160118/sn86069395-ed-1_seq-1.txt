urday when the Good Roads Associa
tion held an adjourned session at the
Court House to perfect plans for the
$400,000 bond issue. A series of con

seemed to be of one mind.

and reconstructed under the state aid
plan, the state to pay one-half of
the interest and principal of the $400,-
000 voted. Moreover the state will
furnish engineers to see that every de
tail of the construction work is prop
nrly done. The government also will
furnish an engineer to act with the
state's engineer on the job. Mr.
Whittaker is the engineer now in this
county looking after the Princeton
road,
It Was also agreed that the money
raised by the bond issue will be hand
led by a commission of four ciiizens,
bi-partisan and well distributed. A

posed of Jas. Breathitt, Sr., O. H.
Anderson, W. T. Fowler, Ira D.

ANOTHER
BLIZZARD
Swoops Down on Us Before
The Old One Was
Gone.
THIS TIME WITH SNOW
Mercury Hovered Close Around
The Zero Point Yesterday
Morning.
Another blizzard came close on the
heels of the thaw and snow Saturday
and Sunday and yesterday morning
the mercury was down to the lowest
point this winter, close to zero. Three
inches of snow fell Sunday, which
showed no signs of melting yester
day. The best the weather clerk has
to offer for to-day is "fair and not so
cold."
The zero weather has caused a good
deal of suffering in the city and many
people are made to feel the discom
forts of a rigorous winter.
Plumbing is out of repair in many
homes as a result of the freeze and
travel is everywhere interfered with.
The very cold weather will handi
cap the tobacco market again this
week, as it cannot be worked to any
advantage in such extreme weather.

INVESTIGATION
OF EXPLOSION
Edison People Say It Was Not
Caused by Their Storage
Battery.
SECRET MEETING OF BOARD
Several of Injured Men in Seri
ous Condition and Not Ex
pected to Recover.
New York, Jan. 17. A statement
indicating that the new Edison stor
age battery was not in any way re
sponsible for the explosion on the
submarine E-2 at the New York navy
yard Saturday was made by Miller
Reese Hutchinson, chief engineer for
Thomas A. Edison, and a member of
the nuval consulting board.
The preliminary inquiry into the
explosion was held in secret by the
board of inquiry appointed by Rear
Admiral Usher, commandant of the
navy yard. Neither Admiral Usher
nor any of those present would dis
cuss what occurred at the inquiry.
Persons on board or near the E-2 at
the time of the explosion were ques
tioned at length, however.
Rear Admiral Usher made the fol
lowing formal statement:
"The board of inquiry met yester
day and went aboard the submarine
where they conducted a thorough in
vestigation. The investigation was
not finished and therefore the board
will again meet. No conclusion was
reached,"
Secretary bf the Navy Daniels, who
is expected to name a board of inquiry
to conduct a formal investigation, left
for Washington without making any
statement regarding the explosion
At the tnavy yarn inquirers were
turned away with the statement that
Rear Admiral Usher and the others
conducting the inquiry had "nothing
to say."
At the hospitals where the injured
were taken it was said several of them
were in a serious condition and
is expected to die.
one
Nothing approximating an official
theory as to the cause of the explosion
which resulted in the death of four
workmen and the injury of ten others
was obtainable.
The only light shed upon the disas
ter contained in the statement of Mr.
Hutchinson, who absolved from blame
the Edison battery designed to mini
mize the danger to submarine crews
resulting from accumulations of gas.
The E-2 was the only boat thus far
equipped with these batteries, the
tests of which were reported to be
thoroughly satisfactory.

miles, while in Mesopotamia Ihh Brit

place a large number of Turkish offi

Successes for the Russians in the
fighting in Persia are also claimed ty
Petrograd. In its official report Pet
rograd makes the first announcement
that the Germans are fighting with-
the Turks in this region.
The Turks in retreaf along the Ti
