"Boot and shoo workers aro 'aristo
crats of labor' compared with railroad
employes, so far as hours of work
aro concerned," according to av bulle
tin sent out by railway labor organiza
tions. That bulletin says:
"Whereas nearly 90 per cent of tho
onginoers and flromen on tho western
toads work 10 hours or more a day
ess than 5 per cent of tho boot and
shoo workers undergo similar strain.
"A recent bulletin of the bureau of
labor statistics gives statistics rela
tive to tho boot and shoo factories,
while tabulations from tho pay-rolls
of 20,000 eugineors and firemen made
in the course of arbitration proceed
ings, tells tho story for railroad men.
"In not a single occupation out of
tho thirty-seven principal occupations
in tho boot and shoe industry did moro
than G per cent of tho employes work
over sixty hours a week in 1911. Con
siderably over half of those employes
worked fifty-four hours or less av week.
"The railroad pay-rolls on tho other
hand, show that 8S per cent of the lo
comotive engineers and firemen
worked 10 hours or longer a day, and
that 35 per cent worked twelve hours
or longer. During tho fiscal year 1914
thoro were over 41,000 Instances of
railroad employes engaged In tho
movement of trains who were on duty
for sixteen continuous hours or long
er, and wore thus subject to unusual
fatigue and strain.
"Wliile railroad engineers and fire
men, in recent years, have been com-
kpellcd to operate larger locomotives
and heavier trains without material
changes in hours or wages, tho hours
of boot and shoo workers have been
reduced 3 per cent since 1910 and
their wago rate increased 12 per
cent."

The Torch of Civilitntien.
In the history of civilisation ilr.it one
nation mises nnd becomes the torch
bearer ami then another takes the
torch as it becomes stronger, the
stronger always pushing the weaker
aside und becoming in its turn tin-
lender. Each nation that has borne the
torch of civilization has followed some
path peculiarly its own. Egyptian.
Syrian, Persian, Greek, Roman, Frank.

progress directed under supreme an
thorlty, maintained by armed organi
sation. We Anglo-Saxons bear the
torch of civilization because wo pos
sess tho principles of civil liberty, and
wo have tho character, or should have
the character, which our fathers have
transmitted to us, with which to up
hold it. If wo have not. then bo sure
that with tho certainty of n law of
nature some nation it may be one or
it may bo iinother already knocking at
our doors, will push us from tho way
and take the torch and bear It onward,
and wo shall go down. Thomas Nel

Classification of Stars.
In classifying stars astronomers rec
ognize six degrees of magnitude, but
tlie term relates to radiance or bril
liancy rather than to size. Although
the classification is somewhat arbi
trary, yet each degree oC magnitude i
approximately two and a Iiailf times a-'
brilliant as a star of the next mng.il
tudo below. Then, too. each magnitude
Is about three times more nunx-i-
than the one which precedes It. t'o
ginning with the brightest, there are
visible without n glass about twenty
stars of the first magnitude, about siv
ty-live of the second magnitude, ne'j I
200 of tho third magnitude, over 400 or
the fourlh magnitude, about 1.1CU of
tho Hfih and over !!,000 of the sixth.
The total number of stars th.it can be
seen by tho unaided eye Ib about 5.000.
but not aall at one time. This takes no
amount of tho nillllonr.. perhaps hun
dreds of niilllous, In regions of ijpan
that cannot bo reached by the unaided
eye.
Hot Winds.
The slroci o blows hot from the high
lands of north Africa and falls on the
Mediterranean as far as Malta. Tlie
salano Jumps like a windy fireball
from the heat of the Sahara deHcrtund
lauds fiatfooted In Spain. The harmat
tnn blows hot Sahara dust far into the
Atlantic and gives nosebleed and
makes skin and Hps parch and crack,
while furniture and ship timbers groan
and cruel; and scream in tin agony of
droughty despair. The khnsniln blows
Sahara's ancient dust Into Egyptian
eyes every fifty days. The pamperos
periodically blow down Into Buenos
! Aires out of tho unexplored desert j
highlands of Brazil, aud tho blowing
causes suicides nnd murders to bo moro
common and wounds to brenk out
