'*{t N. J. Loring of this city is in'pofi
session of an acre patch of ginsen?
near his home in the west' part of
towi) from which he netted a tidy
sum this fall when he sold two hun
dred pounds of the dried root to ail
ftrjtt^or atottt four jBttd a.hjilf

large qpatftity Mr. Loring has- ship

Mr. JLioring's first experiments
were made with a small bed of gin
seng a number of years ago and sipc«
then by degrees he has planted in
rotation tea beds, each measuring
four by sixty feet. The different
beds are so planted that they will
reach maturity one at a time in as
many successive seasons and as one
crop is harvested, seed is put in the
same ground to yield in Its turn
quota of medicinal herb. The gin
seng acre would appear to the jn
inltlated to ta equal almost to the
proverbial gold brick, but when one
takes into consideration the length
of time necessary to develope the
tiny seed first placed in the ground
to the finished product, the enthus
iastic gardener is less Imbued with
the project
4
i'«'

The seed must freeze
in the ground two winters. That Is,
the planting is done in the fall and
In eighteen months, or the second
summer, It will sprout and the pale
green shoot must grow and mature
in practically entire shade for four
years before it can be dug prepara
tory to drying the root for commer
cial purposes. Artificial shade is se
cured by building a light frame work
perhaps six feet from the ground on
which lathes are placed about an
Inch a part. This arrangement al
lows the slanting rays of the sun to
reach the yoijng plants and also
Iceeps the soil, -which must be rich
and loamy, damp. After being dug
the matured root is. placed _on a
frame in the sun to dry, the samo
process being followed as that for
the drying of fruit and vegetables.
However, of late years it has been
found that the kiln dried product is
slightly better and manufacturers
pay a higher price for it.
The word GinBeng is derived from
the Chinese and the root of the
plant, Aralia Sclimscng, was by that
people first valued as a medicine.
The Chinese variety has, however,
become so rare that the American
genus bas largely taken its place and
its root is now an article of export
from America to China.
jThe root when dry Is of a yellow
ish white color with a sweetness in
taste somewhat resembling that of
licorice, combined with a slight aro
matic bitterness. Its medicinal
value cannot easily be overrated,

IMS OPEN FOR
•Webster City Has Reason to Be
Proud of Successful Rest
y':. Room.
The Webster City rest room, used
every month by hundreds of Hamil
ton county residents, has just com
pleted.a successful cycle qf fourteen
months of existence. .The latest re
port, for the month ending Jan. 1^,
1916, shows the number of visitors
from other towns during the month
to have been 229 number from the
country, ,94i. n.uiqWr-of children
number from Webster City 307 to
tal for the month 630. ..
The total number -of visitors to the
rest room during the fourteen
months of. its existence has been
10,428. Many of these have been"
girls, women or children who were ill'
and required the services of the very
efficient matron," Wjjs. J. C. Robison.
Only th6se who visit the rest room
every day have any idea of the num
ber and variety of calls upon the
matron.
A stack of post cards and letters
addressed to her attest to the aid
which has been received by girls or
women traveling and in doubt what
course to pursue women in distress
girls who missed tlieir trains and
were properly directed or suitable
lodgings found for them girls who
have no home in the city and have
needed counsel or advice calls for
servants or clerks or" other help.
Many a night the rest room has been
kept open to accommodate some
lonely woman who has been waiting
for friends or a train and otherwise
would have been compelled to spend
her time in a hotel or a' station.
The mission of the room has not
only been a place ot repose for weary
travelers, but it has branched out
and is now a combination of infor
mation bureau, counsel office, and
general headquarters for .many
things.
During the fourteen months, sev
eral improvements have been added
to an already well equipped room.
The Commercial League has purchas
ed a newvaccum cleaner for the rugs
and added a drinking fountain. A
gas heater has been added. Beauti
ful fancy pillow slips liave been giv
en, also two chairs, a fern, towel
racks, and all the magazines that
«ould be taken care of.
The room has fulfilled expecta
tions in every way and its privileges
very little abustfd. A woman, evi
dently with, a mania for crocheting,
one day appropriated a dainty bbby
pillow, slip—perhaps to learn the
stitch, but at any rate she has for
gotten to return it. Seldom, howev
er, have advantages been taken, and
the room is dally fulfilling its mis
sion.-

Webster City Five Handicapped by
Poor Condition of Ells
worth Floor.
The Webster City high school bas
Jkel-lMtU .tffeAirl wwv Us secpml straight
Victory of th^ season at Ellsworth
Saturday night. The game was close
and hard fought throughout. Th^
Ellsworth team was leading 8 to 13
at the end of the first half, but Web
ster City soon regained the lead in
the second session and, maintained it
to the end of the game. The final
score was 23 to 22 for Webster City.
Ellsworth has one of tho best
basketball records for a town of its
size in the state, and last year de
feated Webster City decisively in the
opening game between the two
schools.
Tho visiting team was handicap
ped by the poor condition of the
Ellsworth floor, the surface being
unusually slippery. In addition, the
room was poorly lighted and heated.
In spite of the obstacles to fast team
work, tho Wo was hotly contested
and the is3uo was in doubt until the
final whistle.
The Webster City line-up consist
ed of Greenwood at center, Froning
and Tatham at guard, and Wilkin
son and France in the forward posi
tion, with DeFranco as substitute.
The most spectacular player ot the
game ^as Olson of Ellsworth, who
played center. His work was con
siderably marred at times by unnec
essary roughness, but was otherwise
very effective.
The Webster City team, having
defeated Nevada and Ellsworth in
out-of-town games, will initiate the
home season next Saturday, Jan. 22,
in a game with the strong Pomeroy
I've.' The game will be played on
the new floor above the Mercantile
store. Pomeroy has one of the fast
est teams in western Iowa, coached
by Latham of Iowa University, and
tl\o gamo is considered the hardest
on the schedule, next to the two con
tests with Fort Dodge.

A very small audiehce In taniSoln
high school ^auditorium Friday, night,
greeted one of the finest debater ev
er held In Webster City. It is sure
ly not realized generally that the
material on the local debating tfeam
is of t^et finest quality, or larger au
dienceswould be present to hear the
debates* The decision of the judge
in this city was unanimously in fay
or of the negative side—Webster
City's team. The decision of the
judges in Humboldt that night was
iman'mously in favor of the .nega
tive side—or Humboldt's team,
Henco the joint debate in this city
and Humboldt, in which each town
sent a iebating team to represent
their schlool in the debate, ended in
a tie, as did the last football game
played between these two high
schools.
The boys of the Webster City team
who debated in this city were
George Worthlngton, McKinley Mc
Collough and Anthony Sparboe. The
members of the Humboldt team
wli ich took the affirmative side of the
question in this city were Albert
Winters, Cecil Munson and Fern An
derson—all boys. They were accom
panied by Supt. Bassett of the Hum
boldt schools. The question was:
"Resolved that the state should
adopt a minimum wage law, consti
tutionality being granted."
The judges in this city were I* G.
Focht, an Eagle Grovo banker Prof.
Munson of the English department
of Ellsworth College Mr. Stetzel, a
manufacturer of Waterloo and an
Ames graduate.
The boys have all been trained for
the work by Prof. M. L. Mitchell to
whom great credit Is due. Hoi has
worked early and late with the boys
after school hours and after supper,
zealously training and bringing out
the latent debating talent which
lies within so-many bright ^liigh
school lads. No matter how much
talent may lie dormant, nothing
short of a patient, efficient trainer
will bring it forth, and this has been
splendidly done by Prof. Mitchell.
Friday noon tho. members of
the team from this city went to
Humboldt. They were Harold Lane,
Arthur Wahl and Merville Gllmore.
The boys were accompanied by their
trainer. Prof. Mitchell, and took
their defeat in that city with char
acteristic. good grace. Prof. Jackson
and Prof. Sifert acted as timekeep
ers in this city, with Supt. Kelly pre

Night.
A few days ago the Freeman-Trib
une contained an item concerning
the trial of the publishers of the
Menace, an anti-Catholic paper,
charged with violating the law
against sending obscene matter
through the mails. The Menace has
hundreds of readers in Webster City
and Hamilton county, who are more
or less interested in the trial, which
resulted In the acquittal of the pub
lishers, as the following dispatches
from Joplin, Mo., where the trial
Was held, reveals:
After deliberating since 7 o'clock
last' night a jury in the United
States District court here today re
turned a verdict of not guilty in the
case against the Menace Publishing
company and Marvin Brown, Bruce
Phelps, "Wilbur F. Phelps, and 'The

HAMILTON COUNTY
AIL THE TIME.
GEO/ AMBROSE SHOT IN BACK
Accident was Purely Accidental—
Bullet Enters Back of Boy
Above Hip.
'''i?,'k
A very distressing accident occur
red late Friday afternoon at the'
Eli Howd farm, about three miles
northwest of this city, when George
Ambrose, the twelve year old son of
Mr. and Mni. George Ambrose, living
north jf the city, was accidentally
shot while hunting pigeons. The lad
and two companies were shooting jl
pigeons in the roof of the barn on
the Howd farm and the Ambrose boy
was hanging to a rafter, preparing
probably to jump down upon the
hay, when one of the lads below—
Hilmer christopherson of this city—
began to load his rifle which was ac
fidently discharged, the bullet en- 'V
tcring theNback of the Ambrose boy
just above the hip.
The injurjed lad was immediately
taken to the. home of his parents
north of this city and a local phy
sirian called. The bullet was not lo
ated that night but the boy reBted
fairly comfortably all night. The
bullet entered the lad's body low
down in the back on the right side r,
and the greatest danger Is from pob
sible infection. jJ*
The affa'r was of course purely ac- r,
ldental and no blame whatever
attached
vrfao la
"wte:-rrbly
cident. The supposition Is, that tb&
hammer of the riftle cfcught in the
lad's coat just after reloading the
gun and was ,in thjit manner dis
charged. All will js?mpathi?e deep
ly with the Ambrose and Christop
herson families over the distressing
accident.
