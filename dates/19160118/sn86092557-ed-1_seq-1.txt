Brief Survey of
War Situation
The Balkans continue to be one
of the chief centers of interest in
the war news, although the Mon
tenegrins' plea for peace means
the elimination of one of the ac
tive factors In tbe military situa
tion here.
Entente Interests appear to be
watching closely the situation In
Albania and recent advices from
London declare that adequate
force8 are now on hand to defend
that country. The belief is, indi
cated in these advices that that
Italy's precautionary measures
in Albanian territory have gone
toward safeguarding the future in
terests of Montenegro whose mil
itary collapse seems t(5 have been
well nigh inevitable after tbe
- crushing of Serbia by the Teutonic ,
allies.
Little attention so far has been
paid in Entente quarters to the
report that allied troops have been
landed near Athens jis German

German sources comes additional
reports that a landing of Entente
forces has been made at Piraeus,

ARCTIC OUTLET
."vt- '.g" ;
Alexandrovsk Has Some
Pronounced Advantages
Over Archangel.
(Correspondence Associated Press.)
CHRISTIAN1A, Norway, Jan. 18?
When the new railway connecting Pe
trograd "with Arctic port of Alexandro
vsk is finished it will be possible to
transport goods from Tromso in Nor
way to the Russian capital in five days
time. A new steamship line has al
ready been organized to take advan
tage of the new route, and it is expect
ed that the railway will be available
within a month or so.
Although much further north than
Archangel on the White Sea, which
is already connected with Petrograd
by the narrow guage railway, th'e new
port of Alexandrovsk is free from ice;
all the year round by virtue of being:
situated on the Gulf Stream, while
Archangel is closed to navigation for
six months of the year.
One of the dilficultels of the Arch
angel route has been the tremendous:
congestion of traffic, and this will still
be a problem for some time as the new'
railway from Alexandrovsk will at
first be in a roundabout way via the
Archangel route. But a direct line
from. Alexandrovsk to Petrograd is to
be completed as soon as possible.
Parents Fined For
Permitting Truancy
Three Russian miners who refused
to send their children to school were
arrested at Farming! cm by the truant
officer, C. W. Atha, and brought be
fore Justice Toothman who fined them
each $2 and cost when they promised
to let the children attend the school
hereafter.
The Russians live In the Chatham
Hill district and the school Is at the
same place. Mike Wlkoff and Alec
Collkoff each had one child they had
been keeping from school while
George Schmlcht had two between the
ages of 8 and 15.

Fines.
OFFICERS GOT $1,000
Costs Fifteen Dollars To
Prosecute Each Viola
tion of Law.
Fines, aggregating $8,200 and court
costs estimated at more than $1,000
have been assessed against the viola-1
tors of the Yost prohibition law by
justices of the peace in Marion county
during 1916 according to the reports
completed today in the office of Clerk
of the County Court A. G. Martin.
The reports show that fines have been
assessed against 73 persons. In addi
tion each of the persons fined has
been sentenced to work for at least
60 days on the county roads.
The reports show that $483.10 has
been collected in cash and turned over
to Sheriff C. D. Conaway. The amount
of Yost law fines uncollected amounts
to $7,716.90. The law requires that
uncollected fines shall be worked out
on the county road gang, the prisoners
being allowed $1 a day credit on his
fine. j
Justice of the Peace R Leigh Flem
ing has sentenced the great majority
of Yost law violators. He has sentenc
ed 63 persons, nine of them to pay
fines of $200 each and 54 to ay fines
of $100 each. Justice M. R. Musgrove
has sentenced seven persons to pay
fines of $100 each for violations of
the Yost law. Fines of $100 have been
assessed against one man each by Jus
tice L. L. Parrish, of Worthington;
Justice J. M. Barrack of Mannington,
and Justice Lee Toothman of Farm
ington. The half score or more of oth
er justices in the county have sentenc
ed no one for violation of the Yost
law.
On account of tlio large amount of
fines uncollected and which must be
worked .out ? on. the county road' gang
it is difficult -to estimate to what ex
tent the enforcement of the Yost law
has affected, the finances of the coun
ty. With less than $500 of the $8,200
in Yost law fities collected in cash it
is evident that the money return is
not large. The cost of $15 on an av
erage for prosecuting each Yost law
case making a total of more than $1,
000 in costs for the year in most
cases it is said by the county to con
stables. Justices and witnesses but it
muBt be returned to tBr county by
the prisoners either in cash or lauur
on the county roads. During 1915 the
most of this amount has undoubtedly
been returned in labor.
With between $8,600 and $9,000 In
Yost law costs and fines worked out
on the county roads against $500 col
lected in cash the question of to what
extent the county profits financially
by the enforcement of the Yost law
must therefore be determined by what
has been accomplished toward the
improvement of county roads by pris
on labor.
A credit of $1 a day is allowed the
prisoner against his fine for each day's
work and the sheriff Is paid 60 cents
a day by the county for feeding priso
ners working on county roads as
against 60 cents allowed for prisoners
confined, in jail. In addition guards
for the road gang must bo paid, wag
ons must be hired to carry the priso
ners to work and a certain amount of
shoes and clothing must be furnished
poorly clad men before thuy can ho
compelled to work on the roads.
Closely assoclatted with the enforce
ment ot the Yost law is the enforce
ment of the law against drunk
enness. During 1915 a total of 85
persons were fined $1 and costs each
for drunkenness by the Justices of Ma
rion county. Of these fines 51 were
imposed by Justice Fleming, ?2 by
Justice Musgrove Imposed fines of $5
Parrish. Fines of $6 and costs were
imposed on one man each by Justice
Fleming and Justice - Musgravo' for
drinking on trains. A fine of $15 was
assessed against one man by Justice
Fleming for drunkenness in a mine.
Justice Musgrave Imposed fines of $5
each on 21 persons for Bmoking ciga
rettes and Justice Fleming fined 15
persons for the same offense. Justice
T. G. Price of Monongah imposed on#
fine for smoking cigarettes.
Fifteen persons were sentenced to
pay fines ot from $10. to $25 each by
various Justices of the county for un
lawful hunting. Justice Musgrove fin

Wage Agreements in Six
teen States Expire This
Year.
STRIKES if IN FAVOR
Men Will Continue to Work
Pending Settlement of
Negotiations.
(By Axsoclateil Preus.)
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Jan. IS.?
About 1300 delegates faced President
John P. White, when he opened the
twenty-fifth convention of the United
Mine Workers of America here today
for one of the most important sessions
the organization has held In a long
time.
Before the convention adjourns it
will have outlined a policy that will
affect probably a half million coal
miners In the United States and Can
ada. Wage agreements expired this
year in all hard and soft coal dis
tricts of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana
Illinois, West Virginia. Kentucky.
Michigan, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma,
Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, Montana,
Wyoming and Washington. In these
states there will be new demands
made and if the powers that now con
trol the miners' organizations have
their way, coal mining will continue i
without interruntion so long as there
is a possible chance of coming to an
agreement. President White favors
such a policy and has stated that there
should be no strikes so long as there
are honest efforts made by each side
to arange new wage scales.
The Union anthracite mine workers
have already formulated their de
mands and the convention is expected
to ratify them without much discus
sion. This will leave the way open for
a wide discussion of the proposition
of adopting a basic wage scale for all
bituminous coal fields. Then will come
the adoption of a policy that will affect
all districts, anthracite and bitumi
nous.
The Qhio-miners have agreed lo
ask 10 per cent' increase In wages
on a mine run basis and lippe to have
such a-demand insert'eSPlji the tfage
scale to be adopted bj^ the convention.
Other districts are expected to fall
In line with Ohio. Leaders of the un
ion say that while industrial condi
tions are favorable for asking for
higher wages and general improve
ments in working conditions, the con
servative members of the organiza
tion will try to prevent the convention
from running wild and making radical
demands.
German Uapitol
In Italy Not Great
INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT THE
FINANCIAL CONDITION OF
THAT COUNTRY.
AMSTERDAM, Netherlands, Jan. 18.
?Germany has not made auch a thor
ough "pacific penetration" of Italy's
financial and Industrial markets as is
generally reported, according to Fran
cesco Nitti, the former Italian minis
ter of agriculture, who has contribu
ted an article on the subject to the
current number of the Dutch Journal
for economics and geography. Gfir- j
many, he says, has only placed cap!-1
tal amounting in the aggregate to
$8,000,000 into Italian enterprises.
There are but tew purely German com
panies of Importance in Italy, he says,
but, on the other hand, numerous Ger
mans have actively.participated in-the 1
working of Italian companies without
putting any money into them.
Revenue statistics indlcato that last
year the total of taxed foreign capital
in Italy was approximately $100,000,
OOO.^of which roughly $60,000,000 was
French and Belgian; $22,000,000 Brit
ish any only $5,000,000 German, more
than half of which latter sum Is rep
resented by two most prominent Ger
man steamship lines. What there is
of ."German penetration" says" SIgnor
Nitti, is chiefly represented by indi
vidual Germans who act. or have acted
as managers of Italian banks and as
agents or French, Bellan and British
trading corporations.
The Italian - authority further re
marks with disappointment that Amer
ican' capital holds aloof from Italian
financial undertakings "which is more
regrettable since America is the only
country which the Italians need not
suspect of ulterior motives," and he
adds that the great volume of Italian
exportB and labor to the United States
; would seem to justify the expectation,
that Americans would show more in
terest in Italian finances. .
