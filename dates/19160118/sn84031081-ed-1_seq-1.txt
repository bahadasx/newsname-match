Berlin, Jan- 17 (by Wireless to Bay
villa.) Berlin newspapers, according
to the Overseas Newi agency, express
the belief that the landing of allied
troops ut I'haleron, five miles south
west of Athens, is considered as sup
plying proof that the entente powers
intend Uting extreme means to force
the hand Of Greece.
The news agency statement con
t Inuet:
"Berlin newspapers, commenting
on the latest news regarding Qreoce,
unite in stating that the entente
seems to have abandoned nil retard
for Greek neutrality und sovereignty.
The taadlng at Phaleron is consid
ered as proof that Hie entente is now
going 10 use extreme meant fur forc
ing Greece.
The fact that the British are
blockading the Creek coast most
lightly, and are subjecting Greece to
oile r inconveniences, is Interpreted
by the papers as meaning that the
entente is fomenting and preparing
tin overthrow of the Oroek govern
ment in order to substitute .a repub
lic with Veniaeloa at tin- bead. Grati
tude is unanimously expressed by the
newspapers that tile entire army and
tin majority of the Greek population
are on the king's side anil will frus
trate all attempts against the coun
tivV v,.- cr-ignty and tb" luntc's life.
The Kelttttlg Am MitUg declares
thai the entente intends Hie assassin
ation of ;i country which refuses to
commit suicide.''
The news agency says lhat accord
ing to prevalent reports, the Hreek
government hat transferred part of
the state archives in Lariata lh
northwestern Greece, where eventu
ally the Greek government likewise
will be transferred.
Tho foregoing contains the first in
timation from any .source that the
allies have effected '1 lunding at Pha
kron.
