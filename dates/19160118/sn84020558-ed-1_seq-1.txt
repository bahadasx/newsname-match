If the rain keeps up, and nothing happens to disturb the unceas
ing flow of waters into the great lake behind the dam. at Roosevelt,
" thirty-six hours after Tho Republican reaches it readers this morn
ing, the reservoir will be full, and the great dam will be overflow-
ing.
This news was given out by the Reclamation service yesterday
afterrtoon. It will come almost as a thunderbolt to water users of
the valley, but it will be a most welcome piece of news. Although
the lake has not been so very low at any time sinoe its overflow
last April, that it was' about to slop over again, was not surmised
by the most optimistic.
In the last twenty-four hours, end
ing yesterday morning, there had been
n cain of SII.S77 acre feet. The dam
only larks about L'nn.OiM'i aire feet of
being full. Later reports Rave the
inflow at about liiii.ouii acre feet a
day. There was also an increase in
elevation of 5.15 feet. At six a. m.
the intake was registering an inflow
of 7.3(1 feet. At three o'eloek it had
raised to 8. SO feet.
Granite Reef is also (loins its share I
of the good work. The elevation
raised there until yesterday after
noon it was registered at 2. SO feet.
The highest point last year was 3.30
feet.
Late reports from the dam last
night, had it that the elevation was
still going ui), and lacked hut ten
feet of spilling over. t that time
the intake was registered at 9.20 feet.
If It Overflows.
Word was passed along to the sher
iff's office yesterday afternoon, that
if conditions did not change, and the
dam overflowed, people living in the
river bottoms south of town would
be in imminent peril. The river has
already raised, so that many ranch
houses are inundated and in danger
of washing away. Sheriff Adams
looked up a boat, and with its aid,
went sailing around the river notify
ing ranchers that they had better
move before they were drowned out.

was farmed quite a bit prior to the
building of the dam, and this helped
considerably. Though it is an ideal
project, we have one other of about
40,000 acres which is paying out faster
than here. The farmers on that project
took up desert land and do not have
the burdens that your farmers have

PEACE PARTY'S
PLANS HALTED
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
THE HAGUE, Jan. 17. (Via London)
Germany's refusal to permit mem
bers of the Ford peace board to travel
through German territory to Scandi
navia has temporarily halted the
board's peace plans. The members to
day selected Stockholm for the regu
lar meeting place, but so far appeals
to the German minister at The Hague
and also to the Berlin foreign office
for permission to cross Germany again
have been denied.
About ten days ago the entire expe
dition crossed northwestern Germany
on a special train from Copenhagen,
but now the Berlin military authorities
absolutely refuse again to grant such a
privilege, inasmuch as the state de
partment at Washington also has re
fused to extend the American pass
ports to include Germany. As a result
the members say they will remain at
The Hague and wait indefinitely if
necessary.
Stockholm was selected because it
was far removed from the vicinity of
the belligerents.
Dr. Charles F. Aked and lime. Rosi
ka Schwimmer said today that it woul
be many weeks before the board is
sufficiently organized to enable it to
do anything more than preliminary
work.

would make it unlawful to ship in in

wholly or partly by children under 16

In its repirt the committee directed
attention to the fact that in several
si-utliein states having extensive cot

HERS VOTE TO
(Special to The Arizona)
CLIFTON, Ariz., Jan. 17. Striking
miners in the Clifton, Morenci and
Metcalf districts today voted to re
turn to work for fifteen days pro
vided the managers of the Detroit
Copper company, the Shannon Copper
company and the Arizona Copper
company will agree to a conference
with the men before the expiration
of that period for the purpose of
adjusting existing grievances. Inci
dently the agreement to return to
work carries with it the provision
that during the fifteen days none of
the former employes who refused to
join the union and who are now at
the companies' refugee camp at Dun
can shall be reemployed.
While the mine managers admitted
tonight they had been unofficially
informed of this action they would
make no statement pending official
information. As there are upwards
of thirteen hundred former employes
in the refugee camp it is not believed
the managers will consent to the pro
posed arrangement. This means that
the strike situation is apparently
again deadlocked.
Rumors are persistent, however,
that by some means or other, the
strike will officially end not later
than January 20. Now that the
Western Federation of Miners has
been renounced, the strikers are said
to be just as anxious to return to
work as they were at any time to
remain out. Should a majority of
the men vote within the next day or
two to return unconditionally, it is
understood that Sheriff Cash will
guarantee the mn ample protection
and practically force the reopening
of the mines and plants.
The proposal of the men to return J
to work is made w ith the under-1
sctanding that the ld scale shall ob
tain, which means that upon the re
sumption of work the men will begin
working on a basis of 24 cent cop
per. The scale as presented by the mine
managers a few days ago does not
thoroughly appeal to the men, it is
said, particularly on the point of the
hours the men are to be given credit
for working. It is believed however,
that this is one of the points that
would be considered in arriving at a
final settlement.

Officials indicated clearly tonight, I

upon resolutions adopted in connec
tion with propositions to resume
work, the primary demand of the
managers, the elimination of the
Western Federation of Miners hav
ing been met a week ago.
The report upon the resolution giv
en out by the press committee of

"The striking miners and mechan
ics voted to go back to work with
the understanding that a conference1
with the managers will be granted
within fifteen days.
"Clifton accepted the proposition
first, then Morenci then Metcalf.
This action followed a proposition
offered by the managers three days
ago to the effect that the men re
turn to work and discuss grievances
and the wage scale later.
Another report published here stat
ed that in the resolutions adopted
the men offered to reutrn to work
for fifteen days, on the old scale, ad
vanced to include "copper selling at
24 cents," provided "that at the ex
piration of the fifteen days, the man
agers would meet the committee of
employes for adjustment of griev

former employes from the refugee

Beset on the north, -east and west by

Albania, where hostile tribesmen must

for peace, and her re-
I quest has been granted. The uncon

Montenegro accepted these terms im
posed by the dual monarchy.
This announcement was made to the
Hungarian (parliament by Premier
Tisza, and it met with an ovation on
the part of the members of the cham
ber. Thus comes the first withdrawal
of any belligerent from either of the
alliances that have been fighting with
It had been conceded for days that
the situation of Montenegro was a
critical one. Although the army of the
little kingdom fought valiantly against
!the Austro-Hungarians, it was un
equal because of inferior forces, lack
of guns and, it has been stated, a
shortage in commissariat supplies, to
the task of holding back the armies
that had in conjunction with their al
lies, succeeded in crushing Serbia.
Already the Montenegrin capital and
many of its important towns had
fallen into the hands of the Austro
Hungarians, and the invaders were
well on their way to Montenegro's
chief seaport-Antivari.
Last accounts had the Montenegro
government at Scutari. The where
abouts of King Nicholas is not known.
The Rritish and Russians in Meso
potamia and the Caucasus regions, re
spectively, are pressing the Turks
hard. The army of King George, com
ing northward from the Persian gulf
to the relief of the British forces at
Kut-El-Amara, has driven the Otto
mans to within six miles of the lie-
leagued town on the Tigris.
The Russians, in their drive along
the front of nearly 100 miles in the
Caucasus have won additional points
of vantage from the Turks, especially
in the Arasa and laid Valley regions.
Constantinople admits this, but says
that south of the Arasa heavy casu
alties were inflicted on the Russians.
On the other fronts little fighting of
moment has taken place. The British
and Irench guns- in France and Bel
gium have been busy bombarding
German trenches, while on the Rus
sian front there has been fighting only
at isolated points from the Riga re
gion to Bukowina.
The Italians, through a concen
trated artillery fire on trenches near
Oslavia, taken from them recently by
the Austro-Hungarians, have forced
out the invaders and again occupied
their former positions.
According to the semi-official
Overseas News Agency of Berlin, en
tente allied troops have landed at
Phaleron, a port five miles southwest
of Athens and once the port of the
Greek capital.
The Berlin newspapers, the news
agency says, attribute this as a part of
preparations looking to the over
throw of King Constantine and the
placing of Eliutherios Venizelos, the
former premier, who always has sided
with the entente powers, at the head
of a Greek republic.
