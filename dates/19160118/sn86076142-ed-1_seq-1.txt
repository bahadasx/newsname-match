Mir Aoelall !. -
BERLIN,' Jan. 18. The situation in the Ralkans, tense from
the allied point of view with the capitulation of Montenegrin!),
has entered a new critical phase. Reports say that the entente

FOR USE BY RUSSIA
HITHERTO OCCUPIED TERRITORY
HA8 USED THE JULIAN
8Y8TEM
lllr An4Mliiiel I'reaa.)
WARSAW, Jan. 18. General von
Besclar, governor of Poland, hag Is
sued a decree according to which that
portion of Russia now occupied by the
Germans shall henceforth change from
the Julian to the Gregorian calendar,
and therefore conform to the standards
of a majority of the countries of the
world.
Heretofore Russia and Poland have
gone by the calendar introduced by
Julius Caesar In the year 47 D. C,
which varies by 13 days from the Gre
gorian calendar compiled In the lOlh
century, and adopted by most coun
tries in the 18th century.
The Introduction of the Gregorian
calendar Into the government of War
saw means a cessation of countless
misunderstandings. Heretofore it has
been necessary to "double date" every
proclamation and order. Thus a docu
ment referring to December 11 had
also to bear the date November 28 for
the benefit of Poles reckoning accord
ing to the Julian calendar. In future
all dates will be according to Gregor
ian reckoning.

LARRY HOGUE 8TAND8 ORDEAL
WELL AND 8AYS HE'LL SOON
BE BACK ON JOB

of the oldtlmers In the Tonopah dis
trict, underwent an operation yester
day at the county hospital, his left
leg being amputated at the knee.
Mr. Hogue had his feet frozen last
winter and as a result gangrene set
in. Despite his advanced age and
frailty, there Is excellent assurance
that he will recover. Mr. Hogue with
stood the shock splendidly.
The old prospector has been a fam
iliar figure on the streets of Tonopah
ever since the town was established.
In the early days be acquired a large
acreage seven miles north of town
and has been keeping up the assess
ment work ever since. Each time he
come to town it was with bigger
hopes and more assured than ever be
fore. It was his dream to acquire
riches and then expend his money
on public Improvements for Tonopah,
where he determined to remain. He
has been staked for years by people
of rather limited means In this city,
more for the assistance they could
give him than for any hope of reward,
although he has some properties of
real merit and some small deals have
hn made. Mr. Hogue's convales
cence is hoped for by all who know
the genial old gentleman.

the rabies campaign was set aside
this morning at a special session ot
