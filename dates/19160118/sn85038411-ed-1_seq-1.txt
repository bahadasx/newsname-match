Jitney Owners Appeal
to Council; Want Bond
Now Required Reduced
Kort.v or more jitney chauffeurs this
afternoon asked City Council to recon
sider the jitney ordinance which be
came a law Saturday.
The Jitney men protest against the
tequirement which makes ii niunda
tory for each driver to r>ost a bond of
>2.000.
A. R, Rupley rep
resented the appellants, lie de'clared
1 hat chauffeurs were "light ing for their
»-xistenee:" that "the regulations were
such that, if allowed to stand, would
spell strangulation to the business of
1 he jitney operator."
The former congressman finally got
into a legal argument with City So
licitor D. S. Seitz and had no answer
for the solicitor's statement that the
law under which the ordinance had
been passed had ilrea.dy been tested
in the courts of Philadelphia and ap
proved.
Mr. Rupley declared that the pro
\ isions of the ordinance relative to
regulation were not in accordance with
the law. He appealed for recon
sideration. but was informed that the
law had been passed, that the time
I'or appeal had expired, that the mat
ler had been thoroughly threshed out,
that the people, if they objected, could
have reverted to the referendum—and
that Council was powerless to act.
"Why don't the jitney men go ahead
and operate?" asked Mayor Meals.
"IT they do so they'll be arrested,"
returned Mr. Rupley.
"All right. That's so. Then they

smiling answered the Mayor.
"Why don't the bonding companies
want to give a $2,000 bond, anywav.'"
inquired the Mayor. "It looks to me
■as if the bonding companies look upon

the streets."

Woman's Suffrage Up
By Associated prtss
Indianapolis. Ind., Jan. IS.-—About'
thirteen hundred delegates faced Presi- i
dent John P. White when he opened j
the twenty-fifth convention of the j
United Mine Workers of America here i
to-day for one of the most important
sessions the organization has held in a j
long time.
Before the convention adjourns it
will have outlined a policy that will
affect probably a half-million coal
miners in the United States and Can
ada. Wage agreements expired this
year in all the hard and soft coal dis
tricts of Pennsylvania, Ohio. Indiana.
Illinois, West Virginia, Kentucky.
Michigan, lowa. Kansas. Oklahoma.
Aransas. Missouri. Texas. Montana.
Wyoming and Washington. In these
States there will be new demands
made, and if the powers that now con
trol the miners' organization have their
way coal mining will continue without
interruption so long as there is a
possible chance of coming to an agree
ment. President White favors such a
policy and has stated that there should
lie no strikes so long as there are
honest efforts made by each side to
arrange new wage scales.
To Discuss Wage Increase
The union anthracite mine workers
have already formulated their de
mands and the convention is expected
to ratify them without much discus
sion. This will leave the way open for j
wide discussion on the proposition of
adopting a basie wage scale for all the
bituminous coal fields. Then will come
the adoption of a policy that will affect i
all districts, anthracite and bitumi
nous. The Ohio miners have agreed
to ask a 10 per cent, increase in wages '

"Nothing Doing, Pop!"
Says Local Youth Asked
to Leave the Trenches
"N'othing doing. Pop. I like this too
well. Elmer."
That cryptic but rather startling
message penned from the
the English army in England was the
first intimation that George Kline, Syl
van Terrace, received after months of
anxiety and suspense as to the where
abouts of his son. Since then there
has been another unique development
in the Kline family.
Elmer left home very suddenly just
after the Uusitania incident and vague
reports from time to time led the
father to believe that the boy had en
listed in the British army. He set the
wheels of official machinery in motion
through Senator Penrose. Nothing was
heard definitely from the boy until the
nine-word message from England
reached here.
However. Mr. Kline has suddenly
left Harrisburg and his whereabouts
ure unknown. Therein lies the other
unique development in the Kline sit
uation. Neighbors believe Kline,
senior, has gone to Europe to bring
back his son—or to stay in the king's
army.
Local Boy's Death in
Trenches Not Credited
A report circulated in this city to
day that Archer Owen, of Paxtang,
who left last May for Europe to join
the allied trdups, had been killed in
battle recently, was not credited at. his
home to-day.
Although he has not been heard
from for some time, the last informa
tion obtained by friends here contained
the news that he was in good health.
At his home it was said that had any
thing happened to young Owen, in
formation would probably be received
there.
Owen left last May after taking a
(ourse in salesmanship in the Elliott-
I'.'ishcr Company school in this city.
Later he wrote from France, where he
had joined a Canadian regiment, and

New Discovery in Serum
Therapy Enables Wounds to
Be Cleansed Automatically
By Issociated Press
Paris, Jan. 18. Dr. Pierre Roux,
director of the Pasteur Institute, an
nounced to the Academy of Sciences
last night that remarkable advance in
serum therapy had been made as the
result of a discovery by Dr. Bassuet.
By his method it was possible to
cleanse automatically Dr. Roux said,
wounds which hitherto had resisted
treatment.
Dr. Bar-suet employs the polyvalent
Iserum discovered last year by Drs. Le
clainche and Valle. Dr. Roux said 420
wounded men who had been in hospi
tals from six to fourteen months, were
treated according to Dr. Bassuet's meth
ods. As a result the infection seemed
to revive in the wounds. Abscesses
formed and burst spontaneously, elim
inating bits of bone, splinters, bullets,
pieces of clothing: and cvep drains any
silver threads left in the Incisions by
mistake. After this had happened.
Dr. I toi j x said, the wounds healed
quickly in most rases, and men who
had "been lyinm helpless for months
iwere discharged cured.

British Relief Expedition
Progressing
The situation in the Balkans, sud
denly grown tense from the allied
point of view, with the capitulation
of the Montenegrins, has entered a
new and critical phase, according to
reports through German channels,
which state that the entente powers
have demanded that Greece within
24 hours deliver their passports to
the ministers of the central powers in
Athens.
Lack of compliance by Greece
would cause the allies to take "neces
sary measures" declare the Berlin ad
vices, which are based on a dispatch
from Sofia given out by the semioffi
cial German news agency.
It had previously been reported from
Berlin that the allies were adopting
extreme measures with Greece, land
ing troops at the ports of Athens and
giving other evidences of an inten
tion to coerce her. It is even charged
by the Berlin press, according to a
wireless synopsis of its comment sent
by the semiofficial agency, that the
allies were preparing to dethrone
King Constantine and establish a re
public with former Premier Venizelos
at its head. It was declared that ac
cording to private reports to Berlin
some of the Greek government
archives already had been removed to
Larissa. northwestern Greece, and
that the whole Greek government
eventually would be transferred there.
Teutons Active
Meanwhile come additional reports
of the activities of the Teutonic allies
in the Suloniki sector. Some 320,000
troops are reported to have been mass
ed by them north of the Greek border
while the Turks, who apparently are
to participate in the expected advance
against Saloniki. are said to have
transferred 400 guns from the
Galtipoli peninsula to Nanthi, where
they would be available for use against
the allies' right wing.
British Advancing
Tattle further news has come to
hand of the important operations In
Mesopotamia, where a British relief
force is n earing the beleaguered gar
rison at Kut-El-Amara, tlie Turkish
war office reporting 110 change in the
situation, mentioning however, the de
struction of a British monitor about
23 miles down the Tigris from Kut.
In the Oaucausus the Russians with
strong columns, are pressing their of
fensive against the Turks, admit the
superiority of the Russian forces hut
declare all the Turkish troops are
co-operating effectively against the
advancing armies of Grand Duke
Nicholas.
Operations on the western front
have been confined, as in recent days,
to aeroplane activity and artillery cn
' gagements, the latter, however, hav
ing increased in intensity with the
advent of clear weather.
Kussi&ns Fortified
An indication that the Russians
now consider themselves well fortified
against any German attempt to ad
vance along the right Dvinsk line
across the Dvina is furnished by an
announcement to-day from Petrograd.
This states that the judicial and other
administrative authorities of Dvinsk
who went to Pokov, l!>0 miles north
