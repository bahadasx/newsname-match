guard of Nation Say Civic
Federation Leaders.
Washington, Jan. 18. Stirring pleas
for national preparedness and vigor
ous attacks on "peace at any price"
advocates were made by speakers of
national prominence at the closing
session today of the annual meeting of
the national civic federation.
The speakers included Samuel
Gompers, president of the American
Federation of Labor, John Hays Ham
mond, Senators Wadsworth and
Phelan, former Governor O'Neil of Al
abania, Arthur H. Dadmun, secretary
of the navy league of the United
States, and Talcott Williams of New
York, dean of the Pulitzer School of
Journalism.
Denfense Imperative.
"We are forced to the conclusion,
however opposed we may be to the
profligate expenditure of the nation's
wealth, that niilitary and naval de
fense, even in the case of a peace lov
ing nation, is imperative in the pres-
'ent status of International relations,"
Mr. Hammond said. He asserted that
only two objections could be urged
against preparedness: First, by "the
peace at any price class," because they
fear the development of a militaristic
-tnania; second, the question of costs.
Mr. Hammond urged that the proposed
expenditure of $1,000,000,000 beyond
ihe country's present naval and mili
tary budget be looked on as a " 'busi
ness investment,' an insurances not
always effectual against war but
which will at least minimize the dis
tress incident to war."
Not Political Capital.
The speaker said that the present
was not the time for either political
party to make political capital for
campaign purposes. "If in pursuance
of Pan-Americanism," he said, "we
are to extend our sphere of influence
we shall need an authority of far
greater strength than that of any other
power with the sole exception of
Great Britain. With Japan we have
other issues in addition to our 'open
door" in China policy that might bring
a crisis. Military experts have urged
the utter defenseless position of our
Pacific coast against an invasion by
the Japanese."
Mr. Hammond expressed the belief
that a Panama canal bond issue to
meet the cost of national defense would
be less objectionable than any system
of direct taxation.

as difficult to believe that the "peace
at any price" advocates realize the
"debasing and demoralizing doctrine
they preach."
"The paramount duty of America is
preparedness," he said. "The most
6erious opposition in congress to the
preparedness program is to be expect
ed from those members who bitterly
oppose any reduction in the size or
capacity of the 'pork barrel.' Fortun
ately these defenders of the 'pork bar
rel' represent but a small and noisy
majority."
The speaker urged the adoption of
Australian plan of universal service
to make tip a reserve army.

IS CANDIDATE FOR
HIGH COURT PLACE
'
Judge Ilenry D. Clayton.
Washington, Jan. IS. Judge Henry
D. Clayton of Alabama, congressman
from that state for 18 years, is the
selection of many political wiseacres
as the man who will be chosen by
President Wilson to fill the vacancy
on the supreme court bench caused
by the death of Justice Lamar.
Many of the objections found in
the others mentioned prominently
for the place are lacking in the case
of Judge Clayton. He left congress
in 1914 to accept his present judicial
position. At the time of his resig
nation he was chairman of the ju
dicial committee of the house which
reported the federal trade commis
sion bill and the measure which after
its amendment became known as the
Clayton act.
GOOD REPORT IN
EXPORTS SHOWN
Washington, Jan. 18. War's reduc
tion of imports of chemicals, drugs
and dyes into the United States and
its effect on prices of these materials
is shown in customs figures made pub
lic today. While imports in 1916
dropped to about half the 1914 record
in quantity, increasing prices kept to
tal values almost to the 1914 figures.
Prices in most cases increased in di
rect ratio to diminished imports.
Chemicals, drug and dye imports last
year were valued at $80,000,000, only
about $7,000,000 less than the 1914
valuation. In 1913, however, these im
ports were put at $101,000,000.
Dyewood imports in 1915 almost

MINERS1EET
Thirteen Hundred Delegates
Crowd Into Indianap
olis Convention.
IS IMPORTANT SESSION
Speaking for Half Million
Workers, Representatives
Facing Big Task.
Indianapolis, Ind., Jan. 18 Thirteen
hundred delegates faced President
John P. White when he opened the
convention of the United Mineworkers
of America today for one of the most
important sessions the organization
has had in years.
Before the convention adjourns it
will have outlined a policy that will ef
fect probably a half million coal min
ers in the United States and Canada.
Wage agreements expired this year in
all the hard and soft coal districts oi
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
West Virginia, Michigan, Iowa, Kan
sas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri,
Texas, Montana, Wyoming and Wash-
ington. In these states there will be
new demands made, and if the powers
that now control the miners' organ-
nation have their way, coal mining
i will coniinue witnoui lmerrupuuu bu
long as there is a possible chance oi
coming to an agreement.
President White has stated that
there should be no strikes so long as
there are honest efforts made by each
side to arrange new wage scales.
The union anthracite mine workers
haye already formulated their de
mands, and the convention Is expected
to ratify them. This will leave the way
open for wide discussion on the prop
osition of adopting a basic wage scale
for all the bituminous fields. Then
will come the adoption of a policy
that wili affect all district, anthra
cite and bituminous.
Leaders of the union say that indus
trial conditions are favorable for high
er wages and general improvements
in working conditions.
White Opposes Preparedness.
John P. White, international presi
dent of the United Mine Workers of
America, declared in his biennial re
port, read to the delegates of the union
"fully convinced that the men of labor
are unalterably opposed to the whole
scheme of preparedness." Mr. White
commended President Wilson for
keeping the country at peace, and said
that too much praise "cannot be given
to the president for his great efforts
in this direction." The leader of the
miners then referred to preparedness
and asserted that "the munition man-
j ufacturers who are reaping enormous
profits by reason of the European war
! no doubt have much to do with the
general topic of preparedness."
"Preparedness did not prevent war
in Europe and everything seems to in
dicate that preparedness makes war,"
he continued. "Many of its advocates
do not base their claims on patriotism
t or love of country, but if properly
I analyzed the intense interest they are
manifesting in preparedness is due to
the profits they derive from such a
policy. The experience of the work
ingmen of this nation with military or
ganizations has been such as to shake
their confidence in such movements."
Daniels' Court Making Inquiry.
New York, Jan. IS. The court of
Inquiry appointed by Secretary of the
Navy Daniels to investigate the explo
sion on the submarine E-2 which re

FATHER REFUSES
BAILTOSONSWHO
PLANNEDMURDER
Chicago, Jan. 18. Further investi
gation into the alleged plot of Civing
and Herbert Updike to kill their par
ents was undertaken today by police i
who are cooperating with the Updike
family in clearing up the mystery.
Furman D. Updike, millionaire re
tired broker, today refused to furnish
bail for his sons, both of whom are in
custody, charged with conspiracy to
commit felony.
Although it was said at the time of
the arrest that Herbert Updike was
held only as a witness, a statement by
the boy's father that he considered his
sons equally guilty, and the report
that Herbert married a Chicago caba
ret entertainer influenced the police to
investigate further.
According to the police, Herbert Up
dike on Jan. 8 married Miss Nellye De
Onsonne, a cabaret singer, at Crown
Point, Ind. The authorities say a mar
riage license is on file at the county
clerk's office in Crown Point, showing
that the ceremony was performed by a
justice of the peace. The young worn
an and Herbert, however, deny that
they are married.
Furman D. Updike's statement re
garding his son Herbert's part in the
conspiracy said in part:
"I have no intention of giving bail
tor the release ot my sons at any
time. I have come to the conclusion
that Herbert is virtually as guilty as
Civing.

Ocean Liner
Sinking but

London, Jan. 18. The trans-Atlantic
liner Ryndam passed Southend today
down by the bows with a list to star
board. All her passengers are safe.
Three stokers were killed and four in
jured. The Ryndam is proceeding to Grave
send under her own steam. The na
ture of the accident has not been
learned.
New York, Jan. 18. Officials of the
Holland-American line here had re
ceived no word today other than the
news dispatches of an accident to the
Rvndani. The vessel sailed from here
on Jan. 5 with 101 passengers. She
has a crew of 225 and a miscellaneous
cargo.
The Ryndam sailed from New York
on Jan. 5 for Falmouth and Rotterdam.
She passed the Lizard on Jan. J4 but
her arrival at Falmouth had not been
reported although ordinarily she
would have reached Falmouth the day
after being reported off the Lizard.
The Ryndam belongs to the Holland
American line and has been in service
for a number of years between New
York and Rotterdam. She is 560 feet
long and has accommodations for
2,936 passengers.
WILSON OUTLINES
SPEAKING TRIPS
Washington, Jan. 18. Preparations
of itineraries for several speaking
trips President Wilson expects to take
within the next few months, to lay
the preparedness program before the
country, was begun today at the
White house.
The president believes that in some
sections of the country the necessity
for strengthening the army and navy
is not fully recognized. Invitations
to visit more than four hundred cities
have been received.
Indications are that the president
will deliver most of the addresses in
the middle west, with possibly some
in the south.

ing Papers Seized.
Berlin, Jan. IS, (by wireless to Say
ville). A denial that Captain von Pap
en, recalled German military attache
at Washington, paid money to indi
viduals in the United States in connec
tion with attempts to blow up muni
tions factories or bridges was made to
day by the semi-official Overseas News
Agency. 1
The agency's statement follows:
"British press reports state that the
former German military attache at
"-'-". apiam rapen, naa j
mouth, which contain evidence that
he paid money to persons connected
with explosions in munition factories
in the United States, and to other crim-1
inals. The Overseas News Agency
hears from competent authorities that
these assertions are not correct.
Only Business Affairs.
"Captain von Papen's letters and
bank books, which were seized in vio
lation of the safe conduct guaranteed
to him are a purely personal character
or have to do with usual business 'af
fairs. Captain von Papen never paid
money to persons connected with at-
j tempts of alleged attempts against mu-
nition plants, bridges or any other
American property. No check was
ever paid to Werner Horn, who is ac
cused of an attempt to blow up a Ca
nadian railway bridge.
Didn't Live on Borrowed Money.
"It is evident that the German mili
tary attache never lived on money
borrowed. Therefore the payments he
received from Ambassador von Bern
storff were for expenses in connection
with conducting his office. The let
ters and check book stubs, if repro
duced in facsimile, would prove that
nothing in the way of illegal relations
was established between the dates ol
such payments and of criminal at
tempts. I'sed as Counterbalance?
"The British press reports evidently
are intended to counterbalance the bad
impression created by the publication
of the letters concerning Greece which
were taken from Colonel H. Napier,
former British military attache at So
fia. It evidently is hoped to stir up,
ill feeling against Germany at a time
when Great Britain is observing with
regret the improvement in German
American relations."
GUESTS FLEE FROM
CHICAGO HOTEL FIRE
Chicago, Jan. 18. More than one
hundred guests, many of them scantily
clad, fled to the street when fire was
discovered in the walls on the main
floor of the Chicago Beach hotel, early
today. The fire did only nominal dam

Some 320,000 Teutonic troops
are reported to have been massed
north of the Greek border.
The Balkans continue to be the
chief center of interest in the war
news, although the Montenegrin
plea for peace means the elimina
tion of one of the active factors in
the military situation there. Ad
vices from London declare that
adequate forces are now at hand to
defend Albania.
Little attention so far has been
paid in entente quarters to the re
port that allied troops have been
landed near Athens, as German
press utterances indicate.
An Austrian aeroplane squad
ron has raided Ancona, Italy. One
person was killed but only unim
portant material damage was
done, Rome declares.
In the recent sinking of the Kal
ian steamer BrindisI, which struck
a mine In the Adriatic, M pen-ons
were drowned, it now appears.

Captain von Papen, recalled tier

U. S. HAS NO DOCK
FOR NEW CRUISERS
Rear Admiral Homer R. Stanford.
Rear Admiral Homer R. Stanford,
chief of the yards and docks bureau
of the navy department, has revealed
in his testimony at the hearing beforu
the house naval affairs committee the
surprising fact that not one of th
dry docks of the United States is large
enough to accommodate any of the big
battle cruisers proposed in the admin
istration's naval program. He said the
Puget Sound dry dock could be made
large enough, but those on the At
lantic coast were impossible. He urges
the construction of a dock in New Or
leans. CALIFORNIA BEING

Los Angeles, Cal., Jan. 18. After
causing the loss of at least two lives
and great property damage and send
ing many southern California streams
out of their banks, the rain which has
been falling in this section since last
Saturday, continued today. The- fore
cast is for more rain.
Many families have been made home
less by the flood waters from rivers
and streams which have inundated
the lowlands, numerous bridges hav
ing been carried away and stretch-
i es of highways having been ruined in
nearly every section of southern Cal
ifornia. Steam railroad service was greatly
crippled and in a number of instances
cities depending on electric interur
ban transportation were left without
service. Telephone and telegraph wires
are down and efforts to restore com
munication were rendered almost im
possible by the continual downpour.

According to Report, Plan

Berlin, Jan. W, (via wireless to
Sayville, X. Y.) A note to the
Greek government, amounting to
an ultimatum, is said by the
Overseas News Agency to have
been presented by France and
Great Britain. According to a Sofia
dispatch to news agency, Greece
is required to deliver their pass
ports to the ministers of the cen
tral powers within 49 hours, fall
ing which the entente -will take
"necessary measures."
London, Jan. 18, (4:85 p. m.)
A dispatch from Amsterdam to
the Exchange Telegraph company
says French and British troops
have been landed at Corinth,
Greece, 4S miles west of Athens.
Berlin, Jan. IS, (via London,
3:45 p. m.) The Cologne Gazette
received information today that
the French and British troops
which landed at Phaleron, near
Athens, have returned to their
ships.
Berlin dispatches of yesterday,
which havejoot.boen corroborated from.
French or British sources, stated that
unusual measures were being taken
by the allies in Greece.
According to these reports allied
troops were landed at Phaleron, five
miles southwest of Athens, and also
at Piraus, the port of Athens. In this
connection, the Ovorseas News Agen
cy of Berlin said:
"The fact that the British are
blockading the Greek coast and are
subjecting Greece to other inconven
iences is interpreted by Berlin news
papers as meaning that the entente is
preparing the overthrow of the Greek
government to substitute a republic
with Venizuelos at Its head."
Germany Rejoices.
"Berlin newspapers," says the
Overseas News Agency, in expressing
satisfaction over the surrender of
Montenegro, "point to the political
abilities of King Nicholas and recall
the fact that the emperor of Russia
called him his 'unique friend.'
"It is argued by the press in its
comment that if King Nicholas was
disinclined to follow the example ot
King Peter of Serbia, who at his home
in an Italian palace, they say, awaits a
final victory of his allies after having
been deserted by them, the reason is
that he considers the entente cause
lost.
Cause of Greek Threat?'
"The newspapers also now find an
explanation for the nervous agitation
at the Italian court during the last
few days, it being thought probable
that the heir apparent to the Monte
negrin throne. Prince Danilo Alexan
der, was preparing his relatives there
for the event about to take place. They
declare also that it is now clear that
the extreme measures taken by the
entente powers against Greece were in
order to weaken the impression which
the Montenegrin catastrophe would
cause.
"The general opinion expressed is
that King Nicholas had asked from
Italy help which she was unable to
render, as well as from France and
j pen' and that bv determined strokes
Austria-Hungary has shattered the
whole political structure reared by
Italy in pursuance of her efforts to
drive Austria-Hungary from the
