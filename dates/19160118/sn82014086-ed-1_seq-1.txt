The- father also suggested , that he
would send Herbert, who Is 19. out of
the country if prosecution were drop
ped, but this Chief Lee would not do
althoug'i he said he was satisfied that
Herbert merely pretended to f al . In

der their parents.

satisfied that an injury to his spine
when he was a boy accounted for Irv
lng's designs against them." , They
said they hoped a surgival operation
might restore his mental balance.

to kill his father because he feared his
parents would leave his wealth to
