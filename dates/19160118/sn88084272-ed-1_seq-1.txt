Sir. White commended president Wil

with the general topic of prepared

Touching on the work of the miners
scale committee president White de
clared industrial conditions are creat

"We should demand such improve

Washington. D. C, Jan. 18. So in

today in addressing the Civic Federa

intervention In Mexico today, it would
be three, four or five months before

"Our whole military history has been
a distressing spectacle of waste in
lives and money," he said. "For a cen
tury we have relied n the volunteer
system. I. for one. have no confidence
in the efficiencv of a volnnteer svs-
tem for raising an army not even for J

Widow Says He Was "Per
secuted;" Could Have
Restored Peace.
Widow of an expresident of Mex
ico, senora Emilia Aguilar Vda. de
Huerta. made a pathetic appeal to pres
ident Wilson Monday night to cease
the "persecutions" of her family, now
that Gen. Huerta is dead. . It was sent
following the arrest of MaJ. Luis Fuen
tes, her soninlaw.
In her telegram, adressed to the i
president in person and filled with deep j
feeling, senora Huerta declares that .
Gen. Huerta was forced to leave his
fatherland "from which by your assist- '
ance, he was expatriated." reads the
message. Senora Huerta insists that ,
Gen. Huerta died penniless outside of j
his holdings in Mexico and the mes- !
sage ends with-the significant state- i
ment: "May I not ask this of you, as j
the helpless widow of one who though '
now dead, could have brought peace, j
It leu unuampereu, to my unnappy
conntry."
The Slemage.
The complete text of the message,
which was signed In senora Huerta's
handwriting, reads:
To His Excellency, Woodrow Wilson,
President del Estados Unidos.

My husband. Victoriano Huerta.

the effect, if any. of his death on
you but for me it has resulted In
leaving roe a widow In an alien
land and my children, some of them
still minors, are left without the
protecting hand of a father.
With his last conscious breath
he was noble enough to breathe a
prayer of forgiveness for all those
who had wronged Ifim. I can not
but feel, now that he lies cold in
death all persecution should cease
but today my soninlaw. Luis Fuen
tes, on whom I lean In my great
sorrow, was arrested by the gov
ernment and had it not been for the
great charitv of American friends

am honored, ana my nusoana non-
dying penniless outside of what
-small interests ne may yet nave
left In his own unhappy fatherland
frpm which, by your assistance, he
was expatriated.
May I not expect sir. now that
death has closed his eyes, that you
and your government in living, will
be as magnanimous as he was in
the presence of death and that
whatever persecution he may have
been subjected to In life, will not
be visited on his widow and chil
dren during the time they must
remain in this great country of
yours and until they can return
with the dnst of their father to
their own beloved Mexico.
May I not sir. expect this of you
and -ask it of you. as the helpless
widow of one who though now
Jead. could have brought peace,
if left unhampered to my unhappy
country.
It developed Monday night that the
federal authorities were ordered to ar-,
rest MaJ. Fuentes the morning fol
lowing Gen. Huerta's death and while
his body was in state at the Huerta
home. Through the efforts of mayor
Tom Lea and other Americans, this
was prevented until the general's body
had been placed in the receiving vault
at Concordia cemetery.

could do nothing until Tuesday when
he would speak to Gen. Gavira about
