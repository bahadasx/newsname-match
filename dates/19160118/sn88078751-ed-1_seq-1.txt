On Murder
An Effort
In Internati
Washington, Jan. 17. General Car- .
ronza has decreed death to the ban
dits who murdercJ the seventeen
American citizens at Santa Ysabel
last Monday.
This is C.urana's responso to for
mal representations sent to him by
the Ametlcau government last week-1
domondlug tho Immediate pursuit, I
capture and punishment of the porpe- I
trators of tho massacre.
The answer was communicated to I
Secretary or State Lansing by United
Statos Consul Silliman, who laid the
representations before tho first chief
at Queretnro, Mexico. In the reply I
Carrni.za appeals, to Secretary Lap
sing and tho Amorlcan pqoplo to bear j
with him in his efforts to guard the j
wide stretches of territory In north-
era Mex o, where the murders took '
place. ai..l reminds the people of this I
country that oven In the best ordered
communities in all countries outbursts
against law and order will occur with
destruction of life and property. He
directly charges Villa with complicity
in last Monday's outrage and de
scribes tho murders as part of a delib
erate effort to involvo Mexico In Inter
national complications. .
Carranza's Reply.
TUo message of Consul Silliman re
citing tho roply of Carranza follows:
"Department's telegram concerning
massacre of Americans at Santa Ysa
bel immediately placed before Gen
eral Carranza by mo in person. Gen
eral Cai rana said ho had already is
sued orders for the immediate pursuit,
capturo and punishment of those re
sponsible for the atrocity. He stated
that ho believed this outrage was com
mitted by men associated directly
with Villa, and that It was dono spe
cially to provoke International trou
bles at this time. He said ho had de
clared those responsible outside the
law, to ho punished with death if
caught. He appeals to" the secretary
of stqte and to the public of the Unit
ed States to consider the wide strip
of the Central railway, tho great diffi
culty of guarding the entire distance,
and tho comparatively easy task of
destroying a train and attacking a
email place. Ho says that nobody can.
lament moro than he the atrocity or
bo moro concerned about it, but that
protection is rclatlvo, and that even
in the bf"t regulated states outbursts
of disoidPis and lawlessness may
cause destruction of property and loss

Nowhere In the United States have
the murders of Americans In Mexico
led to more indignation nnd agitation
than In El Paso, Tex., the border city

the victims are known. El Paso, which
is opposite the Mexican city or Juar

Review of Operations On Other
Battle Fronts.
London, Jan. 17. The war offlre
announced the first British success in
Mesopotamia to bo scored In many
weeks. The British relief force which
recently started from Ismiali-Gherbl
to hasten to the aid of the 45,000 Brit
lch troops bottled up at Kut-el-Amara,
sixty-two miles above on the Tigris,
defeated the Turkish army on Jan. 8
and 9 after the Turks had consider
ably hampered Its progress. It then
forced the Ottoman troops to retreat
northwestward along the river to a
point astride the Tigris, twenty-five
miles below stream from Kut-el-Amara.
Three days ago the British
attacked the Turks there and forced
them to retreat further. At last ac
counts they were still pursuing them.
This success represents a gain for
the relief force of more than twenty
five miles after it had been defeated
by th'e Turks at Sheik Said recently,
this latter point being about fifty
miles below Kut-el-Amara. Moreover,
it places it in the immediate neighbor
hood of Ku-el-Amara, so that the
Turkish main force is now between
the main British force in that strong
hold and the relief force.
Petrograd announces that the Rus
sian forces .in Persia hav e occupied
the town of Kengawer, a little over
thirty miles southwest of the Persian
city of Hamadan. which is in their
hands. This places the Russians about
sixty-two miles northeastward of Kir
manshah, last week taken by the
Turkish forces operating in Persia.
Both places lie on the direct road
from Hamadan to Bagdad.
On the line In France and Pelgiura
the operations have consisted mainly
of artillery duels and mining and
counter in' ; work. The big British
guns have thrown shells into Lille,
but Berlin says only slight damage
was done.

official report from Berlin.

Rome, Jan. 17. The Auftrlans have
proclaimed a state of selge at Cet-
tinje nnd have arrested a number of
citizens on suspicion. They have
searched the houses of the town and
have requisitioned foodstuffs and dis
armed the inhabitants. Meanwhile
guns aie being mounted on Mount
Lovcen and trenches are. being dug
around the city. The whereabouts of
King Nicholas are unknown.
It Is extremely difficult to forecast
developments in Montenegro, which
nre expected to be sensational, since
tho Austrians now completely domi
nate the situation. Besides occupying
Cettlnje they have planted mine fields
to protect Antivarl and San Giovanni

by sea, cut off tho wireless and have

STATE DEPARTMENT'S STANK
Proposed New Blockade of Germany
by Great Britain, to Be Legal, Must
Girdle Shores of Germany In North
Sea and Extend Into the Baltic Not
Likely That England Will Attempt
to Penetrate Latter Sea.
Washington, Jan. 17. The United:
States will not recognize the proposed
new blockade of Germany by Great
Britain unless it is made absolutely
effective.
To bo legal in tho eyes of the Unit
ed States such a blockade must not
only girdle the shores of Germany on
the North sea, but must extend into
tho Baltic sea and be able effectively
lo prevent all intercourse across thir
body of water between the Scandlna
yian countries and Germany.
This fact was obtained from high
est official sourcps in the state de
partment. The United States will In
sist that the blockade to bo effective
must operate against trade between
all neutral countries and Germany,
and that it will not so operate unless ,
Norway, Sweden and Denmark are a
effectively shht off fiom commercial
Intercourse with Germany as the
United States, Holland and other neu
tral countries.
In Germany embassy circles It Is
said that If Great Britain attempts tu
renetrato the Baltic for the purpose
of establishing a blockade she wllb
have to undertake the most hazard
ous naval effort of the war. Vessels
sent into tne land locked harbor, it la
caid, will be subjected to such vicious,
attacks from submarines and mines,
as to cause tremendous losses. In the
opinion of German embassy officials
Great Britain does not intend to make
such an attempt, and knows that she
dares not. Therefore, It Is declared,
unless the neutral countries In north
ern Europe will be supinely content
to permit Great Britain to blockade
absolutely their North sea coasts, alb
the talk of a new blockade Is. -nothing
more than talk.
A study of neutral rights and du
ties from the points of neutrals rather
than of belligerents is the tRnt- task,
to be proposed by Secretary Lansing:
for the newly organized American In
stitute of international law. In a
memorandum made public by Dr.
James B. Scott, president o! the or
ganization, the secretary of state
calls attention to the fact that prize
courts and military and naval experts
have had most to do vita formulat
ing rules regarding neutrality. The
result has been, he adds, thatall aid
has been given the belligerents and
little regard has been shown for the
rights ot neutrals , He suggests that
it is tinle lo reverse this process and
oral with the'-problem 'from the polut
of view of lh neutral.
