troops have been landed at
Corinth, Greece, forty-eight

"is the statement that
they intend to advance to
Athens, whence King Constantine,
his court and the
government will retire, in
conformity with the king's
desire to maintain armed
neutrality.
"In Sofia dispatches the
question is asked what former
Premier Venizelos will
do in that event; whether he
will proclaim a republic and
whether the army will side
with him."
BKRLIN, January 18. by wireless

The fac: that the British are blockading

are subjecting Greece to other Inconveniences
is interpreted by the papers
as meaning that the entente is fomenting
and preparing the overthrow of the
Greek government in order t?. substitute
a republic, with Vcnizelos at its

| Baca Valles arrived here last night on j
the train which brought the body de-j
dared to be that of Jose Rodriguez, i
tlie bandit chief executed near Madera
last Thursday. Both bodies are on pub- j t
lie view. Baca Valles. who was known ^
as Villa's executioner at Juarez, was .
marched through the dimly lighted
railway station, where many families i
spend their night. Executions had been
so frequent at Juarez in the final days
j of the Villa regime, however, that lit- ..
tie interest was shown. I
,
Proceedings Are Brief. 1
j The proceedings were brief. The prisoner
said: ,v
! "I am not responsible for the acts of j
j Villa. I beg to see your general." j ?!
The officer commanding the firing j j
squad said he had orders to kill, and he J
and a soldier stepped close to Baca i *
Valles and fired point-blank into the j \
prisoner's heart. The body was then j
taken back to the railroad station.

on the platform among the men, wornen
and children, Ivine about wrapped
in blankets. ^
Lieut. Col. Enrique Cisneros, who was jcaptured
last week with Baca Valles,

j followers caught with him, and, according
to Mexican officials, also will

j squad. r

More than 100 refugees from Parral, ^

! aboard a special train, which started j
| from the Mexican mining center yesterday
afternoon. They reported that
! Villa bandits in groups were scouring
I the country, clearing ranches, mines 'H
arid oth^r property belonging to for- tl
j eigners of everything valuable. As U
{ far as known, the refugees said, no one

Several refugees expressed the opin- ,
ton that Gen. Argumedo. who defeated t
('arranza forces In a battle at Escalon, *'
.January 10. had a plan to attack and '
! capture Juarez. They asserted that t

A demand that the Senate act

o the Mexican people that die
"niteaStates was prepared to use
ts armed force, if necessary, to
irotect American citizens in
nexico, was made 011 the itoor ot

The Mexican question arose
vhen Senator Lewis of Illinois
:skc<l tliat his concurrent resoluion
authorizing the President to
ise tile armed forces of the
nited States for the protection
if Americans in Mexico, much as
he forces arc being used in Haiti ;
nd Nicaragua, be referred to the
oreign relations committee imnediatelv.
Mr. Borah Demands Action.
"I am ready to dispose of this resoluion
now," said .Senator Borah. "The
esolution might just as well be withrawn
entirely so far as any good it
ri11 do the American citizens now |
elng murdered in Mexico, as to &endy
: to the foreign relations commite^
do not mean this as a refietion upon
lie committee. But the Senate ought
[> take a decided step this morning to
how the Mexican people that the Sente
is ready to provide for the use of
he armed forces of the United States
d protect Americans in that country."
Senator Lewis explained that the t
oreign relatons committee was to meet
omorrow and that he understood that \
he committee would act immediately
pon the resolution. 1
Senator Lippitt of Rhode Island inroduced
a resolution of his own au- i
liorizing the President to use the arm- ' .

Kfforts to lead off the debate of the,

tor Lewis, and Senator Stone, chair- |
lan of the foreign relations commit- ; C
be, moved the reference of the resolulon
to the foreign relations commit- (
-eSenator
Stone's Retort.
Senator Lippitt addressed the Senate (
riefly in favor of his resolution urging j .
1 strong language action along the ; '
ne? proposed hv the resolution. He i jj
Iso referred to a publication in which >
was said that the United States will | *
onsult with Latin American countries j ]
efote taking action in Mexico, and he ? ,
ailed upon Senator Stone, chairman of
he committee on foreign relations, to I
now why it was that the United States j
? bound to consult any other governlent
about the. protection of its own a
itizens.
Senator Stone replied that the qucsion
was so inconsequential as to be
mworthy of an answer; that the sug- Jestion
that the I,'nited States is bound j
o consult any government was too
ireposterous for consideration. |a
Senator Stone went on to say in a j o
arcastic vein tliat while there might !
>e a senator or two on the republican!
ide who is really thirsting for Mexi- I '
an gore, he did not believe that to be j *
he sentiment of level headed, conserv- ( f
tive and patriotic senators on the re- r
tublican side.
"1 do not think for a moment." con- 1
inued Senator Stone, "that senators
n the republican side are ready to
ick bloodthirsty tongues in Mexican :l
ore. Why, Mr. President, a declaraion
of war is the last thing they want. '
f a declaration were made it would '
reak their hearts." "
Senators Past Military Age. *
Continuing in the same strain, Sen- 1
tor Stone said ho recognized that J f
otne senators would talk because theyj'
iave nothing: else to talk about and j
nth.the hope of making a sensation.)
iuch senators, he added, while past mil- t
lary age, still have a capacity for dec- I r
imai ion. f
Senator Stone said it was quite likely I ^
here .would be more tragedies in Mexi-j^.
v an iuhk ao Hie iifiMiwuuy arid aaven- I 1
urous spirit of men impelled them to I
ush into danger, knowing while they
id so they took their Jives in their j
ands. He said he thought it was wick- ,,
d for men to go aboard ship bound for <
he danger zone. I
"Such recklessness is a crime against a
he American people, as it tends to in- a
olve our government and our people t
i dangerous consequences.
Senator Stone asked Senator Lippitt
i hat he would have don.* if he had
een President, and the Rhode Island 0
enator replied that he would have sent i,
imerican troops to protect American > j
itizens from the bandits in Mexico. He
ustitied such a course by referring to !,
he President's ordering United States
orces into Vera Cruz without first askng
tiie consent of Congress .to take
uch a step.
Senator Stone insisted that had the j
'resident ordered the army to cross
he Mexican border it would have v
neant war in Mexico, and that only i
'ongress had the right to engage this y

Both in'committee and on the floor of

eaches the Senate, tluere will be a big
ight over the question of local option
Senators who arc favoring the Shep
tard bill, which is the Anti-Saloon
.eague bill, arc against local option
or the District and would force prolihition
on the people of the District
vhether they want it or not. On the
ther hand, many of the senators heieve
that tite people of the District
ihould be given a hand in the decision
of this matter, just as the people
hemselves decide the question in the
itates.
Senator Kern said that his mind was
nore nearly made up on the question
,f local option and that when the prolibition
question was before the Senate
ust session as a rider to the District
ppropriation bill, be bad prepared an
mendment providing for local option.
Predict Bill Will Pass.
Senators favoring "prohibition for the
Mstrict confidently predict that the bill
irili be reported to the Senate and that
t will pass. That the bill will be delated
exhaustively before the Senate
ppears probable.
The question of local option has inolved
