ln discussing the law Chief of Po
lice, J. I Whitesides, said: "There is
hut little Sunday law-breaking in Co
lumbia. Once in a while met chants
are permitted to paper store-rooms on
Sunday in order not to interfere with
their daily business. Work in the case
of tlie Sunday law of course means
work for hire. Sonices in restaurants,
drug stores and the like are classed as
works of necessity. Whether or not
shoeing horses on Sunday when the
ground is covered with ice should be
classed as work or doing good on Sun
day, such as taking the sheep from the
pit, will be a matter for the jury to
decide."
The defense of the blacksmiths will
be that horseshoeing on Sunday under
conditions like those of last Sunday is
necessary. Mr. Heed said today that
the horses he shod were a team used
almost till day Sunday with a coal
wagon and one horse owned by K. (I.
Davis & Son and used to draw a wag
on for the Parker Furniture Company
that day.
Horses I'setl in Funeral.
"I have been in business here fifteen
years,'' he said, "and have never failed
to shoe horses on some Sunday during
the winter. About two weeks ago 1
shod on Sunday a team that the Tandy
Furniture and Implement Company
was obliged to use at a funeral."
The arrests were made by Policeman
William It. Miller on information filed
by Oeorge S. Starrett. city attorney.
Heed has a shop at 121 North Ninth

An order issued by the Missouri
Public Service Commission yesterday
denies the right to a rehearing in the
railroad rate cases. An increase in
railroad rates was granted in Novem

roads in the state asked a rehearing
on the ground that the rates allowed
were discriminatory.
The attorney for the large shippers
in the case also asked for a rehear

the rates allowed in the first order
were reduced in the denial of a re

' The Kuropcan war has increased
the opportunities of young American
men to help in the development of
China," declared C. G. Hounshell,
traveling secretary or the Studwit
Volunteer .Movement, addressing the
Monday Night Forum in the Y. M. C.
A. Auditorium last evening.
"The Chinese students do not want
to learn French or German but Eng
lish," he continued. "And now that
our English and Canadian volunteers
for work in the East are dying in the
trenches, the burden of enlightening
the ignorant has been thrown on the
" shoulders of the students in the col
j leges and universities of the United
States."
The missionary boards and the
Rockefeller foundation are planning
to establish great universities in
China, Mr. Hounshell announced.
American students will be needed as
professors.
"Specialists Are in Demand."
"Five or six hundred students,
specialists in various lines, are need
ed each year. Teachers are needed.
Doctors are needed. Ministers and
Y. M. C. A. secretaries are needed.
The Open Door offers the young man
a great opportunity for noble life
work, and America ought to respond,
now that England and Canada can
no longer be relied on. The Universi
ty of Missouri alone should send a
hundred students.
"The work offers an incomparable
opportunity for service to God and
fellow-man. I have seen a man ill
with fever jabbed with needles to let
the devils out. Shortly afterward, he
died. This is common practice among
tlie native doctors. Dr. W. II. Park,
a man who was graduated at the
head of his class but nevertheless
chose to go to China, has built up a
hospital in a city of 500,000, the only
one in a district inhabited by 0,000,000
people. During an uprising against
foreigners, the Chinese spared him
because they, too, recognized the no
bility of his work. It was his privilege
to draw up, with several colleagues,
the scientific opposition to opium,
which, when presented at Peking and
before the parliament at London, re

Wasn't that ample reward for his

MEXICAN HIS OVER,
SAYS COLUMBIA MAN
J. T. Esrey, Home From
Brownsville, Believes
Trouhle Is Ended.
- I Administration's Policy, He
Claims, Is Supported by
Te.vans and Soldiers.
That there is no likelihood of any
more Mexican raids along (lie Texas
border in the icinity or Brownsville
was the belier expressed this morning
by John T. Esrey ot 517 South Fifth
street, who returned to Columbia
Saturday night, after a mouth's stay
in the Kio Grande Valley. Mr.
Esrey is a real estate man and has
interests in that district. He makes
several trips to Brownsville each year.
"There has been no border trouble
in that region for more than two
months," he said. "Tlie Mexicans
there arc now- practically unarmed."
Mr. Esrey said most persons have
but a vague Idea of the location of
Brownsville, for he had been asked
several times since his return if he
had been near the scene of the recent
murder of the sixteen Americans and
two Englishmen by Mexicans bandits
at Kilometer.
ISrouiistillc Xot Xear El I'aso.
"People don't realize how big a
state Texas is," said Mr. Esrey.
"Brownsville is nearly as far from El
Paso as is Columbia."
Asked about the train hold-up near
Brownsville October 15 of last year
by a band of sixty Mexican bandits,
which resulted in the murder of two
Americans and the wounding of four
more, Mr. Esrey said that the trouble
was ended very quickly. United
States troops on the ground were
given orders to disperse tlie bandits,
but the real action was taken by the
Texas Rangers, or state militia, and
by the sheriff of the county.
There were rumors or a nlot to
raid tlie whole valley. Several prom
inent .Mexicans or tlie better class In
the Rio Grande Valley were round tto
he ring-leaders in the plot. The
sheriff deputized a large force of citi
zens and together with the Rangers,
they disarmed practically every Mexi
can in the district and put to death
all connected with the plot. It was
done quickly and quietly.
.Host Bandits Are Mexican Peons.
Most of the plotters were not resi
dents of the valley, but were peons
irom across the river, Mr. Esrey said.
It has been only in the last two years
that the Mexicans have become bitter
against 1he Americans. Crafty lead
ers have filled the minds of these
peons with the idea that they can
conquer the whole state of Texas.
There is now not the slightest ltf
dication of any more trouble. There
would be no danger of going over to
Matamoras, accrding to .Air. Esrey,
except that all or the border towns
on the Mexican side are filled with
disease. Typhus and smallpox are
everywhere.
"What do the people or the Browns
ville district think or President Wil
son's watchful wailing?' They are
for it, and for the President," said .Mr.
Esrey. "They have no desire to in
vade Mexico. They realize, as the
people farthern north do not, the dif
ficulties of such an undertaking. Con
trary to general opinion, the United
States troops along the border have
no desire to go to war. It is gen
erally believed that the trouble along
the Texas border is over."
