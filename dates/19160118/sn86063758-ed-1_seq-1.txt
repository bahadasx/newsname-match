(By Jno. K. Anil.)
Special to The Herald and News.
Columbia, Jan. 17.?Probably the
chief interest of the first week of the
legislative session centered in Governor
Manning's messsage dealing
with the state hospital for the insane,
w&ich was delivered to the joint asI
sembly i persons by the governor. The
I message is published elsewhere in Tne
Herald and News, and speaks for itself.
The message was long the line taken:
by the governor in his address before
SratA Press association at Chick j
Springs. There was one difference,
however, in regard to the doubling of
the salary of the superintendent by the
governor. In trie Chick Springs adi
dress it was stated that thelegislature
r would be looked to in the matter of reIimbursement,
if the legislature felt so
disposed?if not, that the governor
would cheerfully bear the expense personally.
In the message on Friday the
governbr stated that he does not ask j
i ???pr?n?oifynsnes3
f rtslULUUl XXZLLlXZCkl, f v?x*?*w V?V
of having don? his duty fully repays
} him. > "
The Columbia Record, in a leading
<editorial on Sunday morning, urges a
public subscription by the people of
the state to repay the governor, and
starts the list with a subscription
> of $25.
Following the message of the governor
the general assembly pledged
ifeeltiB tfee following resolution:
"Resolved, That the thanks of this
Joint assembly are hereby extended to
his excellency, Governor Manning, for
his most instructive, interesting and
soul-stirring message, and we pledge'
to-him and .those in authority our hear- j
ty support -in their efforts to better
the condition of these unfortunate
wards of the state confined in the state !
hospital for the insane/'
Governor iMianning -in his address
recommended that the legislature prof
vide $325,000 for maintenance and
$150,000 for continuance of improve-1
ments. This amount of $475,000 is j
about one-fourth of the $2,000,000 to j
"which the ways and means committee j
* has pledged itself to limit the appro- [
j priation bill. I
Adequate provision for the main- j
tpnanrp of the institution is the duty j
"* " " I
of the legislature; the only question
which could arise is as to what is adequate
and as to the policy of the state j
-with regard to the city and the coun- j
try property. These unfortunate wards '
of the state must, of course, be taken!
B care of. This is one of the' state's
W highest duties. Economy with efficiency,
however, can be applied here, wirh
W good business judgment, as well as
elseweherc
Credit to Dr. Babcock and Former
\ Officials.
Mn this connection, it may be stated
that the present board of regents, in
their report, gives credit to Dr. .T. W.
Babcock, the former superintendent,
[for having made practically all of the
recommendations made by A. P.*Herring,
M. D.j Governor Manning's expert,
and to former officials for their work.
The following from the Columbia State
of Sun-day morning is of interest:
^ "Conditions at th<Tstate hospital for
i the insane under the new administration
are reviewed in the annual report i
of the board of regents. Members or
the board are: R. B. Scarborough,
Conway; S. C. Baker, M. D? Sumter;
Christie Benet, Columbia; B. "W. 'Se?
gars, Oewego, and J. E. Sirrine, Green[
ville. . .
' *So great reform 4s brought about
^ by a single effort/' says the board. "RewUk
forms are generally the result of years
HB' of persistent agitation, and what wo
- soall attempt to point out as improre
f meats under tne present aammmuation
are; but the fulfillment of purposes
and plans that have been in the
making for several years. We "would
not disparage the efforts of any single
Vork of |
!
leral Assembly
f individual or give undue credit to any
one person."
"The board says, that practically all
: of the recommendations made by A.
' P. Herring. M. D., Governor Manning's
: expert, were made by J. W. Babcock,
j M. D.. former superintendent of the
I institution.''
Liquor and Prohibition.
j At as former sessions since 1890. i
1 liquor is coming in for a large share \
| of attention. The first bill of the ses- J
; sion to be ordered for ratification was j
the measure of Senator Beamguard of!
York, making drunkenness on the high- j
way a misdemeanor. It was urged that
the present laws were sufficient to
cover the matter, but the bill, which
had already passed the senate, went
through the house by a vote of 61 to
52, and was ordered enrolled for ratification.
. The ways and means committee has
reported favorably the bill to put a |
* J - < O-rt n/\A _* +V./V /liVnArvnl r\f tlia I
I I Una OI $OV,VW at mc uiopvsai UJ. wiit|
governor for the enforcement of prohij
bition. It is said that only one memI
ber of the committee opposed the ap
propriation.
The senate has passed a bill cutting
cut liquor advertisements in newspapers
in the state.
A conference of the members of the
counties which had dispensaries up to
the first day of the year has been
called for Tuesday morning at 9
o'clock for the purpose of deciding on j
some legislation to dispose of the stock
of whiskey remaining in hand when
the dispensaries went out of business
| on the 31st day of December.
?T.'be conference -will be participated
j in by members qt toe senate and house
! from the fourteen counties which sold
liquor through dispensaries up to the
first of the present year when the state
wpnt nmhibition bv ?verdict of the peo
pie. Some of the counties had a good
deal of stock 1-eft on hand while some
J sold. out. Richland had the largest
I amount left over, $35,000, while Charj
leston had about $15,000. Some of the
| counties, Bamberg and Williamsburg
' for instai;ce, sold all of their supply of
! whiskey, and of course they are not
concerned in the action. The conference
was called by Senator Spigener of
the Richland delegation, and indications
are that some concerted action
' u-iii rrsn.lt from the meeting. v
Ma? Be Poured Out
j There are some legislators who favor
| reopening the dispensaries long
' i r?n.c /"if
enougll It? Ul^usc <tt 1 ttau yi
the liquor remaining on hand, while
others believe it would be better to
sell rhe remaining stock at wholesale
; prices to some parties outside of the
i state. But both of the propositions
! will be bitterly fought by the prohibij
tionists on the ground that the stat?
i has ne more right to sell whiskey, or
the counties, than the"people, and this
would assist the blind tiger business.
I They will contend that the wmsKey
: ought to be treated as contraband and
| poured into the gutter as all seizures
j are. There is no likelihood of any reopening
of the dispensaries for a certain
time to permit of the disposal of j
the stock remaining on hand,
j However, this matter will be consid- j
j i red by the conference of the legisj
lators on Tuesday morning, and their
j action will probably be embodied in a !
I bill for the disposal of the stock which
| will appear in both branches.
L. L. Bultman, state dispensary auditor,
estimates that the stock remaining
on hand in all the counties will
reach between $100,000- and $125,000.
He holds his commission still, but is
without authority to compel reports
from the officials of the now non-existent
dispensaries, and there can be
- - " - ^
notmng <ione m me w?iy 01 cueu&ms
up all the dispensaries and disposing
of the details until some action is authorized
by the general assembly. Some
legislation to this end 'must be enacted
at the present session, or' the details
can not be wound up and all the officials
and the dispensary boards and
their clerks released from their bonds.
Rural (Credits.
The subject of rural credits is one
of the most important before the legislature,
and the legislature has an opportunity
for a fine piece of constructive
work along this line If the members
could get together on some feasible
plan which would lay a proper founda- '
tion upon which to build. This could .
>t done with the outlay of very little
ncney. In its last analysis, rural
credits is but an extension of the state
warehouse idea?doing for farm lands
what the state warehouse has done for
cotton?making it a fluid asset, and a
substantial beginning could be made
i by enlarging just a little the machinery
of the state warehouse system.
Senator Sherard of Anderson lias a
rural credits bill which provides for
submitting to the p-c-ople at the next
| general election a ^iu,uuu,uuu issue 01:
bonds. A two-thirds vote of the peo|
pie would be required.
The bill provides:
For a vote by tlie people in the next
general election on the issuance of
bonds not exceeding $10,000,000.
For the creation of a board of rural
credits to sell the bonds and lend the
proceeds to tillers of the soil on long
term credits and a low rate of in
terest.
The bonds would "T)e issued in denominations
of not less than nor
more than $10,000. Kach would be executed
as is now provided by an act
to provide for a redemption of the
siate debt, known as the brown consol
bonds.
The act would create the South Carolina
board of rural credits, which
would be composed of the governor,
as ex-officio chairman; the state treasurer,
the comptroller general, the attorney
general and the secretary of
state, all of whom shall serve as a
board of control without compensation
except for expenses actually incurred
in the discharge of their duties.
The board would be authorized to
elect a commissioner of rural credits,
whose salary would be $3,000 a year,
with actual traveling -.expenses. The
board would have the power to adopt
ruiAc and rp^nlatioTic for the guidance I
of the commissioner, who is given the
right to name such assistants as may
be necessary.
Section 4 of the bill states the purposes
as follows: VThe purpose of this
act is to provide the means and instrumentalities
by which loans may be
made to tillers of the soil at the least
practical cost to them, to be repaid in:
such manner and at such times as will
be least burdensome, and at the same
;jme pro-vide suitable guaranties
against loss, to the end that agriculture
may be fostered and the farm
lands of the state tf-eveloped and im
proved."
Mr. Chapman of Newberry is the
.mthor<of a rural credits bill which has
been introduced, and there will probably
be several measures dealing with
the subject.
Admissions to the Bar.
The senate has passed the bill of
Senator Wightman of Saluda, abolishing
the requirement of two years'
study before one is eligible for the exan
'nation for a license to practice law.
Libraries Bill Killed.
The senate has killed the measure
proposed by Senator Reamguard of
York, providing for a traveling library,
the bill carrying an appropriation of
$3,000. .
in \ewherrv County.
Tiie Xewberry delegation has introduced
measures "to extend the time for
payment of commutation road tax in
Xewberry county until March 15,
1916," and "to extend the.time for collection
of state and county taxes in the '
county of Xewberry without penalty
intil March 15, 1916."
Mr. Workman has a joint resolution
on the calendar, proposing a constitutional
amendment regarding the
classification and assessment of property
for taxation.
iVr. Chapman is the author of two
bills relating to the regulation of interest.
The Appropriation Bill.
The ways and means committee is
working steadily in an effort to get
the appropriation bill reported at the
earliest possible moment, and when
that bill comes in the legislature may
decide to leave matters pretty-.mtxch
as they are, pass -the appropriations,
and go home. Prolonged fights may
develop, however, over the tax commission,
the disposition of -dispensary
stocks and other matters.
Both houses adjourned on Friday
over until Monday night at 8 o'clock.
Longshore Camp, So. 54, IT. 0. W.
Will hold a regular meeting next
Friday night, January 21, at Woodmen
hall. There will be one to join acu
we hope to see a good attendance.

Washington, Jan. 35.?Gen. Car-J
ranza's formal reply to the demand of j
the United States for punishment of |
the bandits who killed IS American |
mining men near Santa Ysabel, Mexico,
had not yet reached Washington tonight,
but officials were not inclined to
doubt the good faith of assurances
! given by the general's ambassador designate
here, Eliseo Arredondo, that
every effort would be made to run
down the murderers.
These assurances were renewed by
Arredondo tonight in making public!
a report to Gen. Trevino in command
of the forces detailed to capture tht
bandits which said those responsible
would be hunted down "without rest."
The day passed without any repetition
in congress of the outbursts
that had marked almost every session
since word of the massacre was received.
Chairman Stone of the senate
foreign relations committee called on
Secretary Lansing and requested that
tho rvkmmiTtAP hp kpnt advised of anv
further information.
The report of Gen. Hrenno as macfe
public by Arredondo said:
^Stopped )>y Derailment
"On Monday at 11:15 a. m., special
train No. 41 left Chihuahua for Cusihuriachic,
arriving at Santa Ysabel at
1:15 p. m. and started from there
and upon arriving at^'Kilometere 68,'
west of Santa Ysabel, it found anot'ner
train of the National railways hauled

persons alighting from their train they
saw armed men on both sides of -the

roaa'wno were arms upvu mcu, cnuw .
which a -so-called general, named Reyna,
ordered that the crew be put under
guard. 'He then robbed all the passengers,
looting the contents of the
cars and express. The murders followed.
"On the same day of the above incident
the general headquarters ordered
that a regiment embark at one?,
under the oommand of Col. Joes Villan-ueva
to start in the direction of Santa
Ysabel with instructions to pursue the
bandits and endeavor to get in touch
with Gen. Cavazos, conmmander of the
detachment at Bustillos, Cusihuriachic
and San Antonio, who was watching
the movements of the en^ny which
had assaulted the train.
Tf Prevent Concentration.
"The bandits, upon observing the
movements of the constitutionalist!
forces in all directions retreated to a I
place called Carretas, according to
small groups which fled towards the
west and south, presumably in the direction
of the mountains of Durango.
if any information is secured that new
bandits have appeared in the mountain
range they will be localize^ by
fr\rr>a.z. and will be hunted down

without rest, in order to prevent their j

"Military headquarters at Juarez in- i
formed this general headquarters that |
our garrisons at Pearson, Casas Gran-1
des and Madera had been increased
With this combined movement of our
farces in two divisions along both
sides of the Northwestern railways it
will be an easy matter to keep all
bands which mas appear away from
the place, compelling them either to
dispense or to intern themselves on
the western slopes of Sierra Madres,
wherjp they will be unable to find any
means of sustenance."

I found the samples in. an office tip
