Fresh Storm Breaks Out in
Upper House As Rhode

Administration Policy.
Says He Would Have Inter

of Massacre If He Had Been
President.
"If I had been President of the
United States last week, when the
report of this murder arrived in
Washington, I will say that another
sun would not have set over the
Sierra Madre mountains before
American soldiers would have been
hot on the trail of the murderers.
"The first scrap of paper I
would have issued in the form of
an order would have been to take
the murderers dead or alive, and
I would have indicated that I
would not object to including some
of their accomplices and sympa
thizers and have ordered the troops
to keep it up until every American
ranchman in Mexico was as safe
as in Washington."

"Purvile and Inconsequential."
The question angered 8cnntor Stone,
and ho characterized It as "puerile, and
Inconsequential.
