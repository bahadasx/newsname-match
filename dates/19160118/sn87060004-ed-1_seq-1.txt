success. The house was well fill
ed with an enthusiastic audience
and the laughter and applause
wbb almost contineous. The play
was gotten no and staged by
Miss Martin who has had several
years experience along this line,
and she is to be congratulated on
tho decided success of this play
gotten up in such short time.
The "Bridal Ohorns" the' "Bill
Posters Ohorns" "singing games,
Tambourine drills, black fa"co
chorus" and "Dutch Ohorns"
were all real good and were
greatly enjoyed. Miss Elizabeth
R8h in the "Japanese Drill"
deserves special mention and was
generously applauded. In Mrs,
Briggs of The Poultry Yard, Miss
Elizabeth Long was leading lady
and played her part to perfec
tion. She was ably assisted,
however, by strong support from
the other characters in the play.
The receipts Were satisfactory
and quite a nice littlo sum was
added to the school play ground
fund. The Mothers Olub deserve
much-credit for'gettiog' numer
ous advertisements for the pro
gram and for the prompt efficient
manner in which this important
part of the work was carried out.
Thanks are also due the Messrs
Webb, Wiley aud Mrs. David
Cowcll, and Misses Oldham and
Fen wick, for tho excellent music
rendered. The same play, with
the ouimissioti of the drills by
tho little bnvfi aud cirlB and the

A NEW SKIN.
Soakea throw od their outer skin
once year. Iluman beings cltango
thrir akin perhaps nine times in a year;
thSV la, they have a new skin about once
in six weeks.
The value of a clean skin in maintain
ing health is not properly understood by
tho majority of people. Cleanliness is a
part of health. You cannot be healthy
unless you are clean not only externally,
but also internally.
Tho blood should also bo assisted
occasionally, like the skin, in throwing
oil poisons bo that the system may not
ct clogged and leave a weak spot for
iscaso germs to enter tho system. When
the blood is clocgcd, wo suffer from what
ia commonly called a cold.
Dr, Hcrco's Golden Medical Discovery
purifies tho blood and eradicates the
Foisona that breed and feed disease,
t ia best for scrofula, eczema, boils,
pimplca and other eruptions that mar
apd scar tho skin. Puro blood is essential
to good health. Tho weak, run-down,
debilitated condition which bo many
people exnerionco is commonly tho effect of
imnuro blood. Dr. Picrco's Golden Med
ical Discovery not only cleanses tho blood
of impurities, but it incroases tho activity
of tho blood-making glands, and it en
riches tho body with an abundant supply
of puro, rich blood.
Tako it aa directed and it will search
out imnuro anu poisonous matter in tho
stomach, liver, bowels and kidneys and
drive it from tho system through tho
naturoi Channels. i
