PICKETT OUT
FOR CONGRESS
Opponents qf Congressman Helm
To Make Fight With Prominent
Shelby County Democrat
Opponents of Congressman Har
vey Helm in this district, have every
thing greased for the entry of Hon.
George Pickett, a brother of Mrs.
"William Severance of this city, into
the race, as the only opponent of
the present congressman. A dis
patch from Shelbyville, Pickett's
home, Tuesday said that Judge Ralph
Gilbert, of Shelby county, who has
been mentioned as a probable candi
date, has announced that he will not
make the race. The dispatch then
said:
When advised that Judge Gilbert
-was out of the race, Mr. Pickett at
once decided to enter and authorized
the statement that the formal an
nouncement of his candidacy will ap
pear in -the papers of the district
this week. He said; moreover, that
lie expected to win it. In this san
guine expectation, Judge Gilbert,
-who has made a partial canvass of
the district and a thorough study of
existing conditions, heartily coin
cides and he cheerfully pledged Mr.
Pickett his full support and whatever
influence he may possess. Mr. Pick
ett served two terms as County At
torney and is now the member from
Shelby in 'the lower house of the gen
eral assembly,, in which he has taken
high rank as the chairman of the
committee on railroads and a mem
ber of the committee on rules, i.i
addition to other important commit
, to omer impugn- . j
gnments not usually accord-.

Pickett is a close cousin ot uov
Stanley.
Can't Muster the Courage
The Nicholasville News commenc
ing upon the effort to get out oppo
sition to Congressman Helm had this
to say. last week:
Tom Cromwell in the Cincinnati
Enquirer says that "certain influen
tial democrats" opposed to Congress-
.man-Helnv-of the Eighth disU-ictare
trying to get the decks cleared oi
t3ier would-be-candidates so uiax,
they can pit Hon. George L. Pickett
of Shelby, single-handed against
Mr. Helm. At the same time the Dan
ville Advocate, always hunting for
a man to run "single-handed against
Mr. Helm," says that "certain influ
ential democrats" are trying to get
William Jennings Price to resign as
minister to Panama, and come home
and undertake the task of beating
Helm, as Gen. Garnett, after can
vassing the situation, the Advocate's
first suggestion, declines to try it.
As Price and Pickett are both per
sonal and political friends of young
Ralph Gilbert, of Shelby, who still
says that he wants to run, and has
Pickett's support pledged, it would
seem the task of selecting some one
t.o "beat Helm" presents all of the
same old difficulties, and would re
quire another "Victoria hotel meet
ing," even if one has not been al
ready held. The boys who really
have congressional ambitions, had
"better lay low, watch the politicians,
all secret meetings, conferences, etc.,
and bide a wee. This is a year of
RE-nominations in the democratic
party in and out of this state, and
everybody from the President down
-will be given renominations, prac
tically without opposition.

KILLING OVER
IN GARRARD
Old Grudge Said to Have Been Re.
sponsible for Shooting Affray
Near Cartersville.
Lancaster, Ky., Jan. 17.
The killing last week at Carters
ville, Garrard county, is said by. offi
cials who have investigated the mat
ter to have been the result of an old
grudge between Bynum Carter Van
Winkle and his brother-in-law, Bert
Wilson, a Rockcastle county resident.
When VanWinklc saw Wilson and
two other men passing along the
road, it is alleged he opened fire on
them, Ed Ballard receiving a wound
from which he died the next morn
ing at the Berea hospital. Wilson
is also reported seriously wounded
with a probability that he will die.
Ed Ballard, the man killed by Van
Winkle, was 19 years old, unmarried
and the son of George Ballard of the
Cartersville vicinity.
Bynum Carter Van Winkle escaped
after he had shot two of the three
men passing his home, and, so far,
Garrard officials have not been able
to locate him, the impression being
that he has fled the country. He is
about 17 years old and belongs to
the same VanWinkle family that
took part in a shooting affair at Car
tersville some five or six years ago.
The story told by VanWinkle's
friends is, that the three passers-by
first opened fire on him, the shots
not taking effect; he at once rushed
into the house, and, securing his
gun, was soon giving them a full
charge of return bullets, with the
above final result.
Kinnaird Ford
Miss fatsy Kinnaird, younger
daughter of Dr. J. B. Kinnaird, and
Elijah Ford, son of former county
Judge A. D. Ford, of this city, were
married this (Tuesday) morning, at
the home of the bride's parents in
Hill Court, the ceremony being pro
nounced at 10 o'clock. 'The young
bride graduated twi years ago from
the Lancaster High School, while the
groom is a capable young business
man of this place, he and his bro
ther being engaged in farming, while
he has other business interests. Af
ter a bridal trip, the young couple
will be "at home" at the Ford residence-
on Richmond avenue.
Without a single exception every
director of the three banking insti
tutions of Lancaster was re-elected
at the stockholders' sessions held at
the various bank offices. All of these
banks are in a flourishing condi
tion, each having declared its reg
ular dividends, besrde carrying a
good amount to the surplus fund.
The Citizen's National holds the dis
tinction of being on the honor roll,
its capital and surplus being the
same, $50,000. Stock in this finan
cial institution recently sold for $200
per share. The National Bank, the
oldest bank of Lancaster, has a sur
plus of $30,000, and undivided pro
fits of $8,000. Its capital stock is
$50,000. The Garrard Bank and
Trust Company, the youngest finan
cial firm of the city, is growing in
popularity and ability every year,
and beside paying its usual dividend
carried $2,000 to its surplus fund,
which now amounts to $8,000.
At the latter half of the season
advances, the bulk of Garrard to
bacco is reaching the market, and
proves to be the more superior grade
of the Burley leaf, the wealthier
class of Garrard farmers having no
reason to rush their weed to the
breaks, as they possess satisfactory
bank accounts and hence are not
forced to put their crops on the
floors until prices rave taken an up
ward tendency. Some sensational
figures have beenreporto'd within
the past few days. D. N. and Em
mett Long having teamed their
crops to the Madison County Capi
tal and effected satisfactory sales,
the former receiving the high ave
rage of $28.91 per hundred, while
the. latter was compensated at an
average price of $24.39 per hundred
for his output of burley. Joe Wheel
er and D. Adkinson have also indica
ted that they are successful tobac
co growers, as their crops brought
over the $20 .mark.
At a called meeting of the City
Council, the deadlock on here for
several weeks was broken by Mayor
L. G. Davidson casting the deciding
vote for Orville Buck, the present
Chief of Police, to be re-elected, and
and also for him to serve as Superin
tendent of the Waterworks. H. T.
Logan, disqualified for further ser
vice by moving beyond the city lim;
