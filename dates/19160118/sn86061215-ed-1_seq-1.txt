ITALY DISCLAIMS
BLAME FOB LOSS
CABINET OFFICER 8AYS ERROR
WA8 COLLECTIVE ONE AND
DUE TO BAD PROGRAM.
Padua, Italy, Jan. 17.—signor
zilai, cabinet minister without port
folio, in an address here yesterday,
speaking apparently for the govern
ment, declared that it was useless to
attribute to Italy responsibility for the
taking of Lovcen and the Montenegro
disaster. As in the case of the loss
of Serbia, he said, the blame was col
lective and the result of the allies' in
effective program.
"Our enemies." said the minister,
"And salvation in silent, servile obedi
ence imposed by one man. We should
have foreseen this work because of the
uncertainties inherent in a league of
free peoples.
"There is no ground for the charge
that Italy is responsible for the errors
of last June. To prepare for the pro
tection of a country without frontiers
before hostilities were pressing was
the common task. In the future this
order of argument will not be profit
able and the governments making use
of it to excuse failures will not merit
nor receive pardon from their peo
ples."

NEBRASKA ASKS REHEARING OF
CASE CONCERNING ADVANC
ED RAIL CHARGES.
Washington, D. C., Jan. 17.—The
Nebraska state railway commission
petitioned the interstate commerce
commission today for rehearing of the
recent decision granting increased
passenger fares to railroads west of
the Mississippi river. The rehearing
was asked in respect to rates in north
ern Kansas and Missouri, in portion
of Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa and Ne
braska. The Nebraska commission
does not agree with the findings on
the facts presented by the railroads
and declares the roads should be re
quired to give figures showing a divi
sion into interstate and intrastate
earnings. Unless such divisions can
be made by railroads, the interstate
commerce commission, the state com
mission says, will soon be the only
rate making body in the United States.

Senator Suggests Method
to Police Lands Now
Ruled By Bandits
CARRANZA TROOPS
AFTER MURDERERS
Report Again Made That
KUling- of Nineteen U. S.
Citizens Is Avenged
Washington, D. C., Jan. 17.—Estab
lishment of a neutral zone in northern
Mexico is to be jointly policed by the
forces of Mexico and the United
States, unless disorders are speedily
controlled, is proposed in a resolution
introduced today by Senator Gore,
democrat, of Oklahoma.
Evidence collected at "El Paso by
state department agents indicates that
Carranza authorities at Chihuahua as
sured C. R. Watson, head of the party
of Americans killed near Santa Ysabel,
that oescort was necessary. In that
opinion, however, many of the Ajneri
cans agreed, although they had sug
gested to the authorities the advis
ability of sending troops with the
party.
The advices further stated that the
Carranza governor of Chihuahua gave
Watson a personal passport and that
the Carranza Immigration authorities
in Juarez gave a general passport for
the whole Watson party. These de
velopments are taken to point to the
responsibility of the Carranza govern
ment for not adequately protecting
the Americans.
RELIEF TRAIN DUE.
El Paso, Tex., Jan. 17.—The relief
train which left here several days ago
to bring to the borders Americans
and other foreigners in the bandit in
fested region of Chihuahua, Mexico, is
due today from Parral. More than
150 Americans from Parral, Chihua
hua City and other points are said to
be aboard.
Officials at Juarez asserted the body
of Jose Rodriguez, the bandit chief
who- was reported to have been ex
ecuted last Thursday, three days after
the slaughter of eighteen mining men
near Santa Ysabel, probably would ar
rive in Juarez today.
Immigration service officials are
planning to prevent the introduction
of typhus into this country.
Dr. John W. Tappan, medical of
ficer of the United States immigration
service, has been instructed to dis
infect persons from Mexico whose
clothing was suspected of carrying
vermin.
CARRANZA WORKS HARD.
Washington, D. C., Jan. 17.—Concen
tration of Americans at Torreon, Mon
terey, and other points where Car
ranza troops can afford them greater
protection was reported to the state
department today by Consul General
Hanna at Monterey.
Mr. Hanna advised the department
of the dispatch of Carranza reinforce
ments from Monterey to Torreon, add
ing that "the Carranza government is
in earnest in efforts to improve condi
tions and to prevent further assault on
Americans. Good order here is main
tained."
Consul Silliman reported from Quer
etaro the receipt of a telegram from
Gen. Trevino to Carranza, notifying
him of the capture and execution of
Gen. Jose Rodriguez and Carlos Am
aya, Villa leaders, on Jan. 13. Gen.
Trevino assured Carranza that "stern
est measures would be adopted against
all Villaists who are considered ban
dits."
Apprehension felt regarding the
safety of Vice Consul Coen at Durango
was allayed today by the receipt of a
dispatch from him reporting F. O.
Emerson, regarding whom inquiries
had been made, safe at Durango.
ITALY TOO POOR
TO AFFORD COAL
Rome, Jan. 17.—In spite of the cold
weather, Italy is a country almost
without coal fires. The only smoke
to be seen is that from railroad loco
motives, factories and a few hotels.
The peasants in the mountains and
the poor of the cities are able to make
a few fires of wood, but coal is beyond
the reach of any except the most
wealthy. American coal lies unsold
at the seaports. On account of high
freights, anthracite costs more than
$40 a ton.

EFFORT BEING MADE TO MAR
SHALL INDUSTRIAL UNITS
OF THK NATION.
Washington, D. C., Jan. 17.—An
nouncement that President Wilson had
written presidents of the leading' en
gineering organizations of the coun
try, requesting the appointment of

tion with the civilian naval consulting

ness for national defense in time of
danger, served to renew Interest In
the subject today.

dent as outlined by him In his mes
sage to congress for marshaling the

othdr business resources in event of

ure of today's program. Seth Low of

sounds ijwtnote On. preparedness
when in his address, he declared that
if the United "States is to prevent the
"antagonisms and hates of Europe and
Its age long tradition of empire" from
finding lodgment on this continent af
ter the war, it must be "by the
strength of our own right arm and by
the willingness to die for what is cer
tainly precloup to our selves and for
what we believed to be no less precious
to humanity."
Mr. Low said he favored the admin
istration's defense program, not be
cause he thought it perfect, but be
cause it was a long step in the right
direction.
"Personally." he continued, "I be
lieve that a short service under the
colors on the Swiss system, modified,
perhaps, to meet our conditions, should
be required of every young man in the
United States, and that we should no
longer depend upon an armv which, as
in England, strengthens the view that
It is the business of a few to protect
all, rather than the business of all to
protect each other.",,
"Any p'an of military preparedness
which makes the flag under which we
live the emblem of our life, our all, and
not a rag with which to protect the
corpse from which the spirit has fled,
I welcome," Miss Maude Wetmore of
Rhode Island said. In presenting the
report of the women's department.
"Preparedness against war concerns
the women," she said. "They are the
ones who carry the heavy burdens of
catastrophe."

County Auditor Reminds
Old Soldiers About
Tax Exemptions
ASSESSORS AT WORK
SINCE LAST WEEK
rhose Released From Paying
Assessments Must Make
Statements Soon
County Auditor Bissell directs the
attention of old soldiers to the matter
of claiming their exemption from
taxes.
The twenty-seven assessors for the
county and city began their work a
week ago today and this is the time
that veterans should be looking after
the exemption matters. They must
claim their release from the tax list
by making a certified statement before
the assessor. Should they not see
him when he is calling In their neigh
borhood then they are asked to come
to the court and make a sworn state
ment before City Assessor John Peck
in his office which Is on the first floor,
the entrance being through the third
door to the right from the front.
It Is very Important that this state
ment be made and left with the asses
sors but should the soldiers not be
able to do this then they have until
September 1 of this year to certify be
fore the board of supervisors. If they
neglect this opportunity, then they
have no chance at all to be excused
from paying the amount assessed
against them. The state law positively
prohibits the supervisors, the auditor
or any other officer making exemp
tions after September 1 and it is hop
ed that all will pay attention to this
and look after their exemptions prefer
ably when the assessor calls at their
homes.
