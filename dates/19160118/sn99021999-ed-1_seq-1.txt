Nebraska Congressman Speaks in

STOCK RAISING" HOMESTEADS
WASHINGTON, Jan. 1", (Spe
cial Telegram.) UrproncntatHe
Scott Kerrls' bill providing for "stock
raiBing" honiesteada of 640 acres,
modeled after the "Klnkald act" of
Nebraska was debated at consider
able length today in the house.
Throughout the debate allusion was
made to Judge Klnkaid's bill which
created a precedent In the land laws
of the country, and so specific were
these references at times that Rep
resentative Klnkaid took occasion in
a short speech to support the meas
ure, but to recite some history, in
connection with the act that will, as
long at it is on the statute books, be
associated with the name of Kln

bo a leasing bill, whereby tho lands
would remain in the hands and under the
control of large ranchmen iudlvidiually.
or on the other hand whether It should
be an enlarged homestead act wehorby
many would be afforded the opportunity
to acquire homes. I did not hesitate to
choose the latter alternative, and I in
troduced the bill for a WO-aCre homestead.
it waa reported as rather a novelty
here and precedents were demanded. My
answer waa that we had better take a
precedent, and that tlila case would auive
as an experiment."

The congresaman told how the bill was
finally passed notwithstanding opposition,
but when it went on the statute books he
was doubtful as "to Its successful opera
tion. It was condemned generally outside
the state and as he went about he
learned how notoriously vicious it was
looked upon, tint when he gut to his
home In the Sixth Nebraska district the
verdict of his neighbors was that the one
section act did possess virtue notwith
standing the strong opposition to it and
the act gained steadily lu liopularity and
continued to demonstrate its merits.
"In the territory where the law is in
operation It has become very popular,"
said Judi,-e Klnkald after palug a com

speaking of the act in mutt luudutory
terms, "and for that reason
