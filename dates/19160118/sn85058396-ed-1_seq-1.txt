Review of War Situation.
The situation in the Balkans sud
denly grown tense from the allied
point of view with the capitulation of
tlie Montenegrins has entered a now
and critical phase, according to re
ports through German channels which
state that the entente powers have
demanded that Greece within 24 hours
deliver their passports to the minis
ters of the central powers in Athens.
Lack of compliance by Greece
would cause the allies to take "neces
sary measures" declared Berlin ad
vices, which are based on a dispatch
from Sofia given out by the semi-official
Germnn news agency.
It had previously been reported
from Berlin that the allies werd adopt
ing extreme measures with Greece,
landing troops at the port of Athens
and giving other intentions of an at
tempt to coerce her
Allies Watching Albania.
Entente interests appear to be
watching closely the situation in Al
bania and recent advices from Lon
don declare that adequate forces are
now at hand to defend that country.
The belief is indicated in these ad
vices that Italy's precautionary meas
ures in Albanian territory have gone
far toward guarding the future- in
Montengro.
Little attention so far lias been paid
in entente powers to the rumors that
allied troops have been lauded near
Athens, as German press utterances
indicate. From German sources,
comes the additional report that a
landing of entente forces has been
mado at Piraeus, the seaport of Ath
ens, as well as in the Bay of Phal
eron. Austrlans Raid Ancona.
An Austrian aeroplane squadron
again has raided Ancona, Italy. One
person was killed but only unimport
ant material damage was done, Rome
declares.
In the recent sinking of the Italian
steamer Brindisi, which struck a mine
in the Adriatic. 260 persons were
drowned, it now appears.
Denial is entered by the semi-official
news agency in Berlin that Cap
tain Von Papen, recalled German mili
tary attache at Washington, made
payments in connection with attempts
to blow up munition factories or
bridges.

tion Over Montenegro Ca
tastrophe Italy's Plan
Falls to Earth.
Berlin, Jan. 18, by wireless to Say
ville. "Berlin newspapers" says the
Overseas News Agency," in express
ing satisfaction over the surrender
of Montenegro, point to the political
abilities of King Nicholas and recall
tho fact that tho emperor of Russia
called him his 'unique friend.'
"It is argued by tho press in its
comment that if King Nicholas was
disinclined to follow the example of
King Poter of Serbia who at his home
in an Italian palace, they say, awaits
a final victory of his allies, after
having been deserted by them, the
reason is that ho considers the en
tente causo lost.
"The newspapers declare it is now
perfectly clear that extreme meas
ures taken by the entente powers
against Greece were In order to
weaken the impression which the
Montenegrin catastrophe would causo.
"Commenting on the military con
sequences of Montenegro's submis
sion, the newspapers point out that
the roads to Antlvarl and Scutari are
now open and that by determined
strongtb Austria-Hungary has shat
tered the whole political structure
reared by Italy in pursuanco of her
efforts to drive Austria-Hungary from

Los Angeles, Calif., Jan. IS, After
causing great property damage, the
loss of at least two lives and sending
many southern California streams oui
of their banks, the rain which has
been falling in this section of the state
since last Saturday continued during
the early hours today. The forecast
"was for more rain.
Many families have been made
homeless by the flood waters from riv
ers and streams which have inundated
the lowlands, numerous bridges have
been carried away in the swirling
waters and long stretches of high
ways have been ruined in nearly every
section of southern California.
Steam railroad service was greatly
crippled, and in a number of instances
cities depending upon electric inter
urban transportation were left with
out any service whatever. Telephone
and telegraph wires were down and
efforts to restore communication was
rendered almost impossible by the
continual downpour and the constant
undermining by flood waters of poles
carrying the wires.
The storm extended into Arizona
and- reports from Phoenix were to the
effect that warnings had been issued
to residents along the Gila river south
of that city to prepare to flee to
higher ground as the river was rising
rapidly and threatening to leave its
banks.
Among the passengers stranded by
the storm was the party of Frederick
William Vanderbilt of Now York
which was on a train blocked some

Von Papen Letters and Bank
Books Seized by British
No Evidence of Bad

DENY CRIMINAL ACTS
Never Paid Money to Cause
Destruction of American
Munition Plants.
Berlin, Jan. IS, by wireless to Say
ville. A denial that Captain Franz
von Papen, recalled military attache
at Washington, paid money to individ
uals in tho United States in connec
tion with attempts to blow up muni
tion factories or bridges was made
today by tho semi-official Overseas
News Agency.
The agency's statement follows:
"British press reports state that the
former military attache- at Washing
ton, Captain von Papen, had in his
possession letters and bank books,
seized by the British at Falmouth,
which contained evidence that he paid
money to persons connected with ex
plosions In munitions' factories in the
United States and to other criminals.
The Overseas News Agency hears
from competent authorities that these
assertions aro not correct. , ,
Von Papen Not Guilty.
"Captain von Papen's letters and
bank books which were seized in vio
lation of the safe conduct guaranteed
to him. are of a purely personal char
acter or have todo with usual busi
ness affairs. Captain von Papon nev- '
er paid money connected with at
tempts, or alleged attempts, against
munition plants, bridges or against
any other American property. No
check was over paid to Werner Horn,
who is accused of an attempt to blow
up a Canadian railway bridge.
"It Is evident that the German mili
tary attache never lived on money
that he borrowed. Therefore the pay
ments he received from Ambassador
von Bernstorff were for 'expenses in
connection with conducting his office.
The letters and check book stubs, if
reproduced In facsimile would prove
nothing in the way of illegal regula
tions was established between tho
dates of such payments and of crim
inal attempts.
"The British press reports evident
ly aro Intended to counter balance the
bad impression created by the publi
cation of the letters concerning
Greece -which, -were, seized from. Col
onel II. D. Napier, former British mil
itary attache at Sofia. It evidently
