premi>es and close them un<ler the provisions of the dry law.
,\s soon as the ownership is established of the whiskv,
champagne and other fine liquor* which were seized, tl'C
law will be allowed to take its course, whomsoever it may
hit. '
When Depute Sheriff Scott Malone. who led the sheriff#
men into the club Monday aftern(»on. has made his returo
on the search warrant issued by Justice Brinker, a hearing

This done. Prosecutor I.undin said, he will vigorously
prosecute those thu» accused under the new dry law s pro«
visions. 1
"It was a Grange coincidence," said Sheriff Hodge lues
dav. "that the room* in which my men found the contraband
liquor were rooms to which the management declared they
had lost the keys "
President of Club Is Amazed
ludge 1. \. Brown, the club, said he was
astounded thai the deputies found liquor concealed in the
club, and assured them that he and the other club officers
knew nothing about whose liquor it was.
Three hundred bottles of miscellaneous fine liquors. sc»r«
eral gallon demijohns of whisky. Rainier beer in cases, anj
a quantity of cham)ia;;ne are stored Tuesday in the court
house as evidence in tcase.
Sheriff Hodge said lie had been Riven the "ti;>" that there
was liquor in the club Sunday afternoon, bv three women
who«e husbands are members.
"They phoned ine." he said. "One woman wa» crying.
She -aid her husband had just come home intoxicated. [
gathered from her talk that he had beaten her
"Another said her husband had returned home front
the club dead drunk. Another asked if 1 could do anything
to put a stop to it. All said they had voted for prohibition.
"I assured them their husbands would hereafter be sober
when they got home, a- I intended raiding the place. <_>!e
of them laughed and said I dared not."
Scott Malone Leads Deputies Into Club
Hodge called I'rosecutor I.undin to his office Monday
and asked for a warrant to search every room and locker ;«
the club.
At 2:15 p. m. Monday. Deputy Malone. with a force >i
other deputies, entered the clubhouse at Marion st. at>d
Fourth ave.
Malone's huge frame towered above the others as he k 1
them thru the main entrance, lie was visibly nervotiv
Inside he asked for Judge Brown, the president, and re: I
the warrant.
'"We'll start looking amund right now. 1 guess, judge.'*
lie ilrawled. "We don't intend to take anybody to jail right
away, so they don't need to hurry out on our account." > *
"There is no aristocracy of lawbreakers recognized nv
eating the contraband. When the search party broke m »
door on the fourth floor, the judge threw up his hand* i;i
amazement.
"Strange!" he ejaculated. "We knew nothing of thi-!'*
They found a small bar equipped with glasses and tra\
Back of the bar were lockers filled with liquor and locket.
(>thcr lockers were in the course of construction.
"No Aristocracy of Lawbreakers," Says Bob
In another room, a "linen closet," which was locked and
the keys "lost." the deputies discovered a trunk crammed
with liquors of superfine quality.
One jug of whisky taken had attached to the handle a
card bearing the name of a millionaire Seattle banker.
"There i* no' aristocracy of lawbreakers recognized by
the sheriff's office," declared Hodge. "We will go after them
where we find them.
"Anyway," he added, "I wa- running out of fuel for ntv
alcohol heater. I'm going to burn Rainier club champagne
in it hereafter."
