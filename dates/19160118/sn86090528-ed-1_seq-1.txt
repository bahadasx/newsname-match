KL I A SO, Tex., Jan. 18. Colonel
Manuel Valles was executed at 5 this
morning within a few feet of several
I'ullrnau ears In which American wo
men and children refugees were sleeping-
Vallofc was known as "Villa's butch
er," laving acted as the bandit chief's
executioner on many occasions.
After he was awakened from sound
sleep on board the day coach which
brought him to Juarez, twenty Car
ranza soldiers led Valles to n clump of
cotoewotKl Irees near the tracks.
Captain Iteb'enio selected as the ex
r-cutlontr of the bandit n soldier whose
brother Valles had executed without
orders.
The soldier placed his rifle clo:-e
to Valles' heart and fired. A number
of njwpnper men and Mexicans wit
nessed the execution.
The naked body of Valles was placed
on exhibition beside that of General
Uodrigvez. who was executed early
this week.
Thousands of Americans and Mexi
cans were expected to view the corpse
during the day. The Carranza authori
ties intend the exhibition or the body
to further evidence that the de facto
government is earnestly trying to wipe
out banditry.
The American colonists In Northern
Mexico are apparently confident con
cerning the ability of the Carranxa au
thorities to protect them and they are
not leaving the country as readily as
the state department desires. In spite
of the warning that has been given to
them. Tho special trains that were
due to leave today were delayed by
the lack of refugees.

UPRISING
IS NIPPED
By United Press.
RIO JANEIRO, Jan. 2S The arrest
of one hundred p'tty army officers
here frustrated an attempt to start a
revolution, the object of which was to
jverthrow President Diaz.
The authorities announced that some
men who are imprisoned on an Island
made an alleged confession in which
they told about the so-called "ser-
geants' revolution," which was said to
have beed financed by a wealthy revo
lutionist. The "sergeants' rebellion" ostensi
bly grew out of the failure of the sen
ate to raise the pay of petty officers
and privates.
It is reported that the revolutionists
planned to seize the fcrts and arsenals
and force the retirement of the present
government.

SNOWFALL
IS HEAVIEST
FOR YEARS
Covers Earth with Three Inch Carpet; Fine
for Wheat; Sleigh Bells Ring Early
and Happy Youngsters Hold
High Carnival
The Bnow-fall of last night is said
to be the heaviest that has visited this
section since the winter of 1910-11. A
veritable blanket of snow averaging
possibly three inches In depth, envel
opes the country and is adding warmth
and mosture and cheer to the growing
wheat upon the Grady county farms.
The Btreets, which have only been
cleared of the f-heets of ice from the
last storm tempted all who owned
sleigh to arise early this morning and
fill the a!r with the jingling of their
bells. A bevy of school misses, await
ing a street car on a down-town corner,
filled the nlr with shouts of enjoyment
and with f.'ying snow balls, while the
usual bad boy was on the scene tak
ing pot shots with the festive snowy
spheres at the headgear of old and
young alike.
The street cur lines of Chickasha,
not being snow broke, were running
later and a little later early this
morning. In tho absence of snow plows
the conductors jind motormen, armed
with shovels and brooms and mittens
and bad dispositions, shoveled and
swept snow and bad language from
the rails ahead of their buggies. This
plan worked out all right and the first
cars ultimately arrired in the down
town districts this morning.
Railway traffic was not delayed,
all passenger trains over the Rock Is
land coming in on fairly good time.
Reports from the Santa Fe stated that
trains on that road were splitting snow
drifts through Kansas and bowling
along toward the Gulf of Mexico on
time. Frisco local offices report all
passenger trains operating on time.
Telegraph and telephone service
were not delayed cr materially put to
CONFESSES
HE'S GUILTY
A. H. Oitbs, committed to jail Fri
day to an ait action of the tederal
grand jury on the charge filed against
iiim of raising a one dollar to a ten
dollar bill, and who had entered a
plea o "not guilty" as charged, yes
terday afternoon sent for Judge Eu
gene Hamilton, t'nlted States com
missioner, and stated he wished to
withdraw his plea of not guilty and
plead guilty. Judge Hamilton took
Gibb's statement and ordered him
committed to the Jail at Muskogee
pending the action of the Vnited States
court.
Gibbs alleged in his statement that
he is 23 years old; that he has a wife
:0 years old; that he had no one's help
in the matter of raising the bill; that
he raised thebill by clipping "the Ro
man numerals from good ten dollar
bills and pasting the same on the cor
ners of the one dollar bill; that his
wife is in delicate health and depend
ant upon hira for support; that ho has
never been arrested before. It is pos
sible Deputy JU Dillon of the I'nited
States marshals office will leave for
Muskogee this afternoon with his prisoner.
GREEK TRANSPORTS
the bad and conversations could be
held all day long with not more than
the usual number of "Line's busy, call
again, please!"
To add to itie general good fellow
ship which abounded on all hands and
on all sides, the weather was only
crispy cold and the air was not travel
ing at such a velocity as to require
an acrobat to breathe it.
Of course, once in awhile some mis
guided pedestrian would step on a
piece of sidewalk whereon the ice ol
the last storm still reposed beneath
the new fallen snow and then, with a
lew well chosen objurations and a
hastened waving of arms and legs
something happened, but such happen
ings were few and far between.
SCR1MAGER SINGS
OF "OLD MISSOO"
AND SLEIGH RIDES
"Oh, I came from Old Missouri, with
its slippery enow and ice and its sled
dir.j; and its sleighing and its mud, so
deep and nice. Yes, I came from Old
Missouri, where the snow falls every
year, and we scoot about In sledges
without a sign of fear; where the ici
cles and the snow drops abound
throughwinter's months and the coal
bills soar higher than Whoa! Dad
blame ye, can't you wait till I'm ready?
Whoa! You dod busted spaivined Ar
abian!" So shouted and sang and sang and
thouted Water Commissioner Scrima
ger thi morning as he fastened some
artistically wrought "runners" to the
thimblc-s of his buggy after he had be
reft that Vehicle of its wheels. "Yes,"
said Mi. Scriminger, "myself and Mrs.
Scriminger and the junior Scriminger
were b.irn in Misouri and wo haven't
had a sleigh ride in steen years.
See that cow bell? Well, I'm going to
fasten that bell about the neck of this
assortment cf horse flesh and heaves
and give the fo'ks an old time sleigh
ride with bells. Cet up, there, War
Eagle!" And Mr. iScrimager disap
peared west on Chickasha avenue in a
cloud of flying snow and a clatter of
bells and hoefs.
HARD HEARTED COURT
SPOILS FINE SPORT
Judge Jones, who is presiding In the
district court this week, has, to use a
rather classical expression, torn his
clothing badiy with the female assort
ment of court house "stenogs." He ac
complished and brought aout this dire
calamity this morning.
.Ross Cox and Billy Cloud were per
ambulating about the court house yard
about ten o'clock hunting rabbit tracks,
when the young ladies of the different
offices espied them and descended,
with squeels of delight, upon them.
Armed with snow balls the short young
lady and the real short young lady and
the tall young lady and the tolerably
tall young lady and tho decidedly tall
jouT'g lady, cuffed and battered and
bruised the aforenamed gentleman,
who responded in kind and with hoarse
shouts of defiance.
It was Uien that Judge Jones came
!n for an inning and lost, thereby,
every suffragette vote at the Grady
county court house.
"This noise is Intolerable," quotb
Judge Jones, with more or less wrath
intoned in his voice. "Mr. Bailiff," he
shouted, "descend you to the outer
yard of this justice dispensory and
quell the riot."
Tim bailiff "descended." tho riot
"quelled."
"Mean old thing!" grumbled the
steogs.

BY WILLIAM G. SHEPHERD,
United Press Staff Correspondent.
SALONIKA, Dec. 11. (By Mail.)
We smashed up a wagon load of re-
fugees as we went altng. It was one
of those pitiful cart loads of house
hold goods, with an old woman and a
baby sitting on the pile and the young
er and stronger members of the family
plodding along In the mud before or
alongside the two oxen. As We turned
down the road the perplexed peasants
turned the oxen and headed for a
roadside ditch. The unusual sight of
an automobile seemed to frenzy them.
A woman and a man struck the oxen
with sticks.
i uh rueem w:iu uowc. wun a crasn
and everybody screamed. The old wo
man held up the baby in her arms.
Thfl bndy ins wagon settled down
into the ditch, on Its side. Gently the
old .woman and the baby slid off into
the mud.
Sign of Retreat.
Beside ' the road was a camp of
British engineers, and we saw them
(locking by scores from their tents to
the scene of the household wreck. Bv
the time we had passed fifty or more
of these parties of refugees we knew
that somewhere ahead the retreat was
under way. As we went along tho
mountain roads In the French ambu
iance we knew how comfortable a
wounded man might be in such a car.
In addition to the spring of the pneu
tnaUe tires, there were the springs of
the car itself., The stretcher seatj
on which we sat were huge steel bars,
which were suspended from the ceiling
of the car by spiral springs. The mo
tion of the ambulance, except for a
slight swaying was almost imper
ceptible. Just when we were marveling at the
comfort with which we were traveling
and comparing our situation with that
of the sad line of refugees, there wa ;
a terrific explosion at the roadside and
the shriek of a shell. A shell drills
a tunnel through the air and through
this tunnel the echoes of the whistling
of the shell jar and clash and mix In
one long whistle. The shell we heard
was leaving us. Through the ambu
lance window we saw first a cloud of
fiuoke and then the outline of a huge
gun, which stood at least eight feet
above the ground on giant wh',J, and
had a mouth that a man, could have,
put his head into. The great cannon
stood within fifteen feet of the road,
but it was so cleverly sheltered and
hidden by decoration of holly that we
had not seen it.
Bulgare Across Valley.
"Let's get out and photograph it,"
said one correspondent.
"Not here," said our lieutenant-guide.
"The Bulgars are across the valley, and
if we stop loi g enough to give them
our range they'll fire at us sure."
The road was cut along the face of a
hill. Below us was the Valley of Cos
torino and four miles awuy, beyond the
valley, were other hills like ours.where
the Bulgar artillery was hidden.
Just a quarter of a mile further and
we reached the shelter of a turn in the
road. The huge English gun behind
us kept spitting out its roaring chal
lenges across the valley. By the watch
it was possible to hear the whine of
'.ts shells for six seconds, the whine al
ways ended in a deep, dull roar where
the shell had broken, some five or six
miles away.
When we tumbled out of the anion-
