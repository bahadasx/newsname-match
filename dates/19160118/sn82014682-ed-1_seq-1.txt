IN TROUBLE BY
Lighthouse Tender's Propeller
is Fouled By Cable From Dis
tressed British Yeoman I
That the bark British Yeoman Is
safe, but that in hauling her to safety
the lighthouse tender Columbine foul
ed a steel towing cable In her propel
ler, and has herself been placed ' in
danger, is the gist of advices received
by radio this morning by Alexander &
Baldwin from Port Allen.
Rushing to the Columbine's assist
ance from Honolulu is the U. S. navy
tug Navajo, 'which lelf here at 8
o'clock this morning as if fiends were
after her, and bucked the seas at the
harbor bar until all that was visible
of her was her funnel, until she head
ed in the direction of Kauai. i
. This afternoon an inquiry as to
whether the Wailele and the British
Yeoman had arrived here yet was
received by the Star-Bulletin from
LIhue. This leads to the belief that
the Wailele is towing the bark to
this port The Inter-Island and Alex
ander & Baldwin both said this may
be possible, although the Wailele has
no Instructions to bring her here.
Before the Columbine was render
ed nearly helpless by her propeller
fouling, she was able to tow the Brit
ish Yeoman away from her threatening
position and moor her fast to moor
ing buoys placed by tne government.
Help In Nick of Time.
Help came to the British Yeoman In
the nick of time. Just before the Co
lumbine reached her the last of her
lines carried away, so that had there
been no assistance present the bark
would surely have crashed on the
rocks and been a total wreck.
President J. A. Kennedy of the Intel-Island
said this morning the Wai
lele, which left here yesterday after
noon with wrecking gear to assist the
British Yeoman, will help the Colum
bine and keep her from drifting
ashore.
That the British Yeoman is leak
ing badly and much battered because
of the waves which have been pound
ing her, also that she has no anchors
left, was stated in the, radiograms re
ceived by Alexander & Baldwin today.
These said it is now believed possible
most of the schooner Prosper's cargo
of coal may be saved. The schooner
only had 200 tons on board when she
drove ashore, the rest having already
been discharged.

damage over Oahu plantation, but a
telephone inquiry laigely discounted
this story. The plantation office said
that a number of trees had been

BITULITHIC ROADS ARE
GIVING GOOD RESULTS
Criticism of Concrete Highways
in California Made By '
C. E. Sloan
A strong recommendation of war
renite for paving, with an equally
strong criticism of concrete without
a wearing surface of bitulithic or
some other well-known type of con
struction, has been sent to Chairman
Norman Watkins of the Chamber of
Commerce's committee on municipal
affairs, by Sloan & Robson, well
known consulting engineers of San
Francisco.
In view of the current interest in
paving and the many opinions ad
vanced locally. Chairman Watkins on
behalf of his committee wrote to this
firm for a statement. A few : days
ago he received a reply, which he
made public yesterday.
Charles E. Sloan of the engineer
ing firm not only tells of what war
renite or bitulithic has done in Cali
fornia, but says that faults are being
fouud in the concrete roads laid in
California, though he adds that con
crete with a proper wearing surface
should make a satisfactory road.

Czarnikbw-Rionda's Forecast
Shows Sugar in Strong Sta
tistical Condition
DEMAND WILLTAKE CARE
OF BUMPER CUBAN YIELD
Only Pressure of Heavy Pro
duction Early in Year Can
Depress Quotations
Cuba's heavy 1913-16 sugar crop,
estimated at 580,000 tons in excess of
last season's output, will not prove
an unwieldy market factor, but is, on
the contrary, apt to be insufficient
for the heavy demands that win be
made upon it by both Europe and the
United States.
: That is the optimistic view of suar
conditions taken by the Czarnikow
Rlonda Company of 112 Wall Street,
New York, in their annual sugar re
view and forecast, received in Hono
lulu today.
Czarnikow-Rionda Companv think
that though temiorary selling pres
sure during Cuba's months of heaviest
production may keep prices for a time
below the level justified by actual
statistical conditions. values will
show a material rise during the last
half of the year.
, The company's annual niarkot re
view follows;
War Overshadows, AH.
"The feature of overshadowing" ini
portance in t world affairs throughout
the past year has been the prosecu
tion, with unabated vigor and deter
mination, of the deplorable European
conflict which started in August. 1914.
While working both financial and in
dustrial havqc in .the various great
countries acjvelx engaged In military
operations; the"" abnormal conditions
arising from . such awful ' destruction
have naturally served to maintain un
usually higher levels of values espe
cially for commodities of indispens
able character required to be import
ed from foreign quarters. v
"Sugar being among the articles
particularly affected, and with United
States and Cuba the sources of near
est available supply, a steady volume
of business with United Kingdom and
France was augmented by smaller
sales to Holland, Portugal, Greece and
even to Russia. Shipments to 15th
December of last crop Cubas to Eu
rope amounted to 375,879 tons, and
exports of United States refined to
same date aggregated 373,052 tons,
making a total of 748,931 tons, in addi
tion to which less significant quanti
ties were drawn from other West In
dian sources.
Big Demand for Cubas.
"Owing to this extraordinary situa
tion abroad, Cuba faced a vastly in
creased demand in a campaign so hin
