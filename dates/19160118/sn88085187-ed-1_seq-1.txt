Bad Women' and Booze
Leave Tacoma Together
(AIT. SMITHH WAKMXfj TO MOTHKKS
"I have often been asked where the crop of disorderly women
springs from. I believe that now in a good time to give warning.
With the mini her of professional women decreasing this is the time
to attempt to prevent a now generation of them.
"More than !»0 per cent of 'bad women' become bad for a single
reason. That in embodied in the one word —opportunity. Because
of the carelessness or indifference of some other person, generally,
I am frank to say, the parents, young girls meet this opportunity
, when they are at a most susceptible ase. I do not believe that any
girl ever became 'bad' because she wanted to.
•■Through lack of warnings and lack of intelligent advice on
things that they should know, girls fail to appreciate the serious
mW dangers that confront them. In my experience nearly every prosti
tute that I have met has fallen into that life because of lack of warn
ing on the part of the mother.''

Not only ure the professional

professionals - the street walkers,
the "chickeiiK," are speedily be
coming h thing of the past.
Tlie.se statements are based on
the observations of one of the
veteran police officers of the
Northwest, Capt. of Detectives D.
O. Smith of the Tacoma depart
ment, who 1b to become head of
the I»pnrtWWlt Feb. I.
In just two weekK a remarkable
transformation has occurred in
the underworld. Women of shady
character are packing up and dis
appearing. Where? That's some
thing the police do not know—
or care. California and Montana,
they tliink, are proving the dump
ing grounds.
Kirst to disappear was the
semi-professional type. They
formed the bulk of the clawg who
frequented second-class cafes,
sipping a stein of beer all even
ing and ready with a sidelong
smile to greet Home unwary male.
Many were women who worked
■t obscure and underpaid employ
ments by day, and were forced
to sell their souls in order to eat.
Others were women—and girls—•
attracted by the bright lights,
i the nerve-stimulnting liquor, and
the temporary fascination of
wrong-doing.
"I have found' through
|M'iMinn| observation and re
ports of my officers that the
cafe type, or the «emi-|>rofes
sional woman of the streets,
has already disappeared,"
n«,vm Captain Smith.
"They will not sit at a
table and drink M>ft drink*,
while waiting for male com
pany. The stimulant tltat
nerved them to do it ha« dis
appeared, jusi us the absence
of the Name stimulant hits
caused men to cease seeking
them in such places."
Night Detective Captain Adam
Wiley declares that there is a
marked decrease of "street
walking" since the first. In fact
there is practically a cessation of
it.
As for admitting that either of
these practices had existed in Ta
coma—of course, a Jiigh police of
ficial is chary of it, though any
officer will admit privately that
they diU exist. But the risk of
arresting an Innocent woman by
mistake caused policemen to
think twice before attempting to
break in on the occupation.
' "In the days wh,en Taeomu's
saloon business was wide open,
the city was over-run with disor
derly women," said Capt. Smith
today. "In two weeks, with
liquor out "' the way, there has
been the most remarkable de
crease in the number of women
here that I ever saw."
In the years from 1892 to 1898,
when Tacoma was "wide open,"
there were between 3,000 and
4,000 professional painted wom
en in the city. Today there arc
not more than GO, the police es
timate, and many of these are
ready to leave as soon as th«y
can realize enough cash to buy
railroad tickets to more profit
able marts.
Members of the pink-cuff gen
try—parasites—always have been
received roughly by the local of
ficers, and there art few here
now.
"There always will be 'bad'
women in Tacoma," says Capt.
Smith. "But," unless saloons agia
are licensed, I believe we are
done with the professional im
moral woman. That olass can
not ply its traffic profitably un

minds of men.
