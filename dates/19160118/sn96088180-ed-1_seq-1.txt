Senators Delate Resolution
Introduced by Lippitt of
Rhode Island and Demand
Immediate Action by U. S.
(By United Prom Leased Wlrd)
Washington, Jan. 18. In a final
tfort to got quick action In the Mexi
can Bit nation a resolution was offered
In the senate today proposing Imme
ll ute intervention, Senator Lippitt
of Rhode Inland was the author, but
senators opposed to the admlnltttra
tlon courso of "watchful waiting"
backed hit effort, and an acrimoni
ous dubate ensued.
Senator Ilorah already had attack
ed the Idea of further delay In ob
jecting to referring to the foreign
committee the resolution of Senator
Lewis proposing to empower the pre
sident to use armed force.
"What the Americans In Mexico
need la aid now," he said. "As far
as aiding them la concerned, the re
solution might as well be killed as
ent into committee.
"I aee reports that thla nation will
not act." retorted Lippitt, "until the
other pan-American countries assent,
Can Senator Stone Inform us bow
long It will take the government to
get permission to protect the lives
of lta citizens?"
To this Stone answered:
"The question la Inconsequential,
and so far beneath a senator's dignity
that I decline to answer."
Thla seemed to rouse Lippitt.
"This situation," he continued,
"resulted from Proaldont Wilson's In
dianapolis utterance: it Js all right
for the Mexicans to spill all the blood
they wish.'
"With that brutal and pusillani
mous course I have no sympathy.
There are. different kinds of blood,
nd one of them Is American. If I
had been president, a day would not
have passed before the army would
have been In pursuit of these Santa
Ysabei murderers."
"There are two or three senators
on the republican side," answered
Stono sharply, '.'who are athlrst for
war with Mexico. Tint a declaration
of war would broak their hearts; It
would leave them nothing to talk
about. They are past military age
themselves, but their capacity for
voluble declamation Is unimpaired."
, 110 MONEY PAID OUT
' BY Iffl VON PAPEN
(By United Press Leased Wire)
Berlin, via Wireless to Sayvllle,
Jan. 18. 'Attache von Papon did not
pay money to personal responsible
lor munition factory or other bomb
plota In the United States, according
to a somt-ofllclal dontal today. This
was made In answer to Brltlah claims
that papers solxod from him at Fal
mouth Indicated such payments.
The semi-official statement said:
"Von Papen's letters and bank ac
counts, seized In violation of the
granted safe conduct, are of a purely
personal and regular business char
acter. He never paid money to per
sons connected with attempts or al
leged attempts against munitions
plants, bridges or any American prop
crty, No chock was cvor paid to
Werner Van Horn. It Is evident that
the German military attache, did not
live by borrowing, and therefore he
received payments from Ambassador
von Dornatorff for office expenses, but
his letters and vouchers, If publlshod
In fao-slmlle, would prove that they
, contain nothing Illegal."

(By United Press Leased Wire.)
Jan. 18. Iilood lottlug continues
lu Mexico. Colonel Manuel Ilaca
Vallea, Villa's "ibuuiier." was public
ly executed In Juarez at 6 a. m, to
day, within a few feet of several Pull
mans In wttU'h American women and
chlldreu rtfugeea were sleeping. Au
thorities placed his 'body on view at
the custom houso, alongside that of
the bandit chieftain, llodrlguez, as
a bloody warning to their cohorts.
The execution followed fast upon
unconfirmed rumors that two more
Americans, Albert 0. Simmons, of
Los Angeles, and Victor Hamilton,
of Chicago, had been sacrificed to the
blood lust of the Villa outlaws.
Vallea was brought, under heavy
guard, from Casaa Grandes In the
day roach of the train near which he
died. Awakened just' before five
o'clock, he waa dragged to a spot
nearby, and shot.
The man who had been responsible
for many executions as Villa's chief
headsman, met his fate calmly aad
without a word. ,
Twenty Carranxa soldiers, -under
Captain Regenlo, 'escorted him to a
clump of cottonwood trees beside an
Irrigation ditch. Then bis arms were
tied with a blue necktie that a sol
dier supplied.
Instead of having an entire firing
squad execute him, Captain Regenlo
selected aa executioner a soldier
whose brother Valles bad killed. Thl
soldier, without an order from his
captain, approached he bound man,
placed the muzzle of his rine at the
doomed man's heart and fired.
As Valles sank In a crumpled heap,
several soldiers fired a volley Into
the air, shouting "Viva Cararnza,"
and "Death to the Villa bandits."
American newsuaner men and a
few Mexicans witnessed the death
Pew, If any, of the sleepers Iri tho
rullmnnB were aware of the tragedy
ibelng enacted near them. The body,
with Its small streak of bloodstain
and the powder burns above tho
heart, was then placed beside the
naked body of Rodriguez in tho cus
toms house, where .many Americans
and Mexicans viewed the remains.
Two special tralus arrived here
today beaming more than a hundred
Americans and other foreigners from
tho Pnrral district.
A Villa deserter said that Villa
reiterated at Rublo bis threats
agalnBt Americans four days ago, and
urged his followers to slay ruthlessly
any "grlngoes" they might encount
er. He declared that the rebel chief
is hiding In the mountains of Dur
ango state.

Flood, and Hundreds of Families Are Made Homeless
When Houses Are Washed Away by the Seething Tor
rents, and Food Shortage Now Threatens District
Urn Angeles, Jan. 18. With six dead and hundreds homeless, the sun
shone todny on scene of devastation wrought by the wind and rain storm
which began sweeping southern California last Friday afternoon. Weather
Forerator Ford A. Carpenter said ho was uncertain whetlier it would clear
UP. ' : i ' '
At It o'clock Uds morning steadily fixing floods made the reported
property damage mount Into the i millions.
An unidentified man, woman and child were drowned today between
Anaheim and Fullerton when the water swept their horse and buggy from
the state highway. Their bodies have not been recovered. Three men were
killed yesterday by the storm. ,
From the mountains to the sen rushed muddy torrents, some of them
bearing careaftses of animals, vat floes of debris, and occasionally a floating
house or building.
Waltouta In the mountains threatened destruction to pipe lines con
veying natural gas to Loa Angeles. There: being no means of getting milk
or farm roduce into the city, 000,000 people faced a aerioua shortage of
food necessities.
Three hundred families were rendered homeless by rivers overflowing
their banks around San Bernardino. The Santa Ana river was running two
miles wide and SO feet deep. In San Bernardino county highways were
damaged to the extent of 100,000. Water rushed through the western
part of Anaheim, forcing many to abandon their homes. Part of San
Bernardino was flooded. ,
Farmers in the lowlands between Loa Angeles and Long Bench who
were lucky enough not to have been carried away fed their remaining live
stock by rowing to sUbles and corrals In skiff.
Transportation wan at a standsUlL Only one train left Los Angeles
today In a forlorn hope attempt to reach San Bernardino, The Southern
Pacific coast line, temporarily repaired at Moor Park last night, waa cut
again by washouta and landslides today.
Although rescue work was progressing rapidly, officials estimated hun
dreds were still marooned in flooded homes, in Imminent peril if the water
rises much higher.
Los Angeles, Jan. 18. -With three
dead, damage amounting to possibly
a million dollars reported, and rail
roads crippled, Los Angeles was prac
tically Isolated today as the result of
one of the worst storms In Its his
tory. Since Saturday night the rain has
been pouring without intermission.
At times the precipitation assumed
the proportions of a cloudburst. Dry
creek beds are brawling rivers, and
atreames that are ordinarily mere
brooks are running two and three
miles wide, sweeping away ranch
houses and livestock to destruction.
The dead in the storm so far are
Fred Smith, a Loma Linda rancher,
drowned trying to cross ,the Santa
Ana river; Alfonso Rivers, drowned
attempting to ford the Ventura rlvor,
and Carl Throkmorton, Los Angeles,
killed In his bathroom by an electric
light short circuit, due, to dampness.
Scores have been rescued from the
floods by posses of deputy sheriffs
and volunteer bands of citizens. Many
of the highways are Impassable, tele
phone and telegraph service la de
moralized, and fears are felt for the
electrlo light systems.
In the country around Los Angeles
scores are homeless. Near Redlands.
a small iriouiary or. mo ennia 'aub
river flooded many homes. Sixty
were' rescued on rafts and In small
boats. Twelve houses were flooded
In East Highlands, where the flood
ran Ave to six feet deep.
As the streams approached tho
ocean they grew worse. At Bell sta
tion, a few miles west of Los An
golos, the Los Angolcs river was
three miles wide, sweeping every
thing before It, covorlng valuablo
ranch lands with slit and debris.
Tho citrus district around Pomona
reported heavy damage, duo largely
to soil erosion and winds. The dam
ago In the Pomona district Is estim
ated at 1500,000. '
Fourteen families wore snatched
from death by the San Bernardino
police. John Fenway and his family
are atlll marooned tin an Ulead near
there, and efforts to reach them have
failed. In the Little Russia district
of Loa Angeles many were forced to

Two hundred passengers of eastern
trains were forced to stop at Pomona
last night, with small hope of getting
either way. Twenty-five tourists
were marooned at Camp Baldy, while
the rain came down at the rate of an
Inch an hour, sending a huge torrent
roaring down the canyon.
Stretches of the new state high
way in the Pomona district have
been ripped away. In some places
the gaps are four hundred to five
hundred feet long.
The northern section of Long Beach
was reported flooded early today,
with police rescuing families in
skiffs. Four persons were taken
from the flooded Golden State Wool
en mills during the night, but 30
others were forced to take their
chances and remain there, as the
police boats were called away for
more urgent rescue work elsewhere.
North of Anaheim road the land
scape resembled a huge brown lake,
dotted with the roofs of dwelling
houses. Dead chickens and other
small animals floated here and there.
Many of the homes still contained
hungry men, women and children,
waiting for rescuers. In Anaheim
itself, due to the breaking of a dyke,
the water was a foot deep In many
business streets. One of the Pacific
Electrlc's few remaining lines, to
Long Beach, was threatened this
morning when the Los Cerrltos
trestle showed signs of weakening.
A $30,000 Ibridgo over the Santa Ana
river collapsed last night, and the
Tippecanoe avenue 'bridge at Red
lands Is a total loss.
The loss to livestock will be heavy.
On one ranch near Playa del Rey,
100 head of cattlo drowned, their
bodies floating on the flood entangled
with trees, bits of houses, furniture,
etc. Chicken ranches were wiped
out. Many horses and cows have
been soon struggling in the Santa
Ana river. '

Pomona, Cat., Jan. 18. With over
eight Inches, or half of the average
season's rainfall, recorded in the last
48 hours, the storm situation In Po
mona is becoming worse hourly and
the damage to orange growers will
undoubtedly prove the worst in the
history of this section. The season's
total rainfall now Is 16.61 inches.
It is impossible to ascertain the
losses, but some of the finest groves
are badly damaged by canyon streams
which have overflowed their banks
or gone back to old channels cover
ed and used for yeara. Heaviest
losses will be sustained by growers
in the Monte Vista tract north of
Karod, through which runs the San
Antonio wash. Thompson and Live
Oak creeks have been on a rampage
since Monday morning. Conduits
and concrete runways installed
through groves have been washed
out with few exceptions. Improve
ments generally through thla section
have proved Inadequate. The storm
is worse than anything experienced
by the oldest residents. Early today
a heavy wind accompanied the storm
and falling trees broke telephone and
telegraph wires In all parts of the
city, almost completing isolation
from the outside world.
All three transcontinental railroad
lines through Pomona valley have
serious washouts and the Pacific
Electric has no lines In operation.
San Francisco, Jan. 18. Storm
conditions approaching those In
southern California existed in some
sections of northern and central Cali
fornia today, and the swollen streams
are being turned Into roaring tor
rents by melting snow.
Train service is badly demoralized,
and at some places traffic Is com
pletely halted. Thousands of acres
of grain lands In the Tulare lake
basin and vast fields of alfalfa and
lowland orchards adjacent to Kings
river, north of Sanford, are seriously
menaced. Workmen were rushed to
the levees in anticipation of tbelr
going out. The state highway in the
vicinity of San Luis Obispo Is im
passable and train service in that
vicinity is badly demoralized.
Creeks down the peninsula from
San Francisco are swollen beyond
their banks and the (business district
of Burllngame was inundated early
today. In the vicinity of Menlo
Park, where are many large country
estates, many wealthy residents were
marooned.
REAL OPPOSITION
TO WILSON'S PLAN
New York, Jan. 18. That the ad
ministration fear ot defeat for Its
military preparedness program is
very real and earnest was the view
leading New York bankers held to
day after hearing Secretary ot War
Garrison's Insistent speech In advo
cacy of the government plans last
night.
Garrison told his listeners frankly
that the opposition to preparedness is
organized and powerful, and suggest
ed that unless preparedness advocates
stand shoulder to shoulder In unttod
action the presont system of defense
or, as he termed it, lack of defense
will persist.
Preparedness devotees, he said,
are bickering among themselves over
details. He termed the continental
army plan tho only feasible one, and
branded1 the militia system as Inade
quate for the needs of the nation
He declared authority vested In the
federal government Is essential.

England and France have presented
a virtual ultimatum to ureece, ac
cording to a Sofia dispatch today.
The note demanded that Greece
give passports to the diplomats of the
central powers within two days.
If Greece does not accept the de

Washington, Jan. 18. Reporting
to congress today on the matter ot
relief ot California and Wyoming
oil men on lands withdrawn by form
er President Taf t, Attorney General
Gregory indicated that the govern
ment Intends to continue Its policy
of asking for receivers tor companies
operating thereon, in order to con
serve the government oil supplies and
profits. He declared that the clause
ot the house leasing bill, making a
precedent for operators now on the
withdrawn lands, would Injure gov
ernment Interests.
"I refrain from making sugges
tions what relief, If any, should be
given to persons who have Invested
large sums In these lands and have
withdrawn oil far exceeding the value
of their Investments," he wrote.
He predicted, too, that the courts
would miBt oil speculators who "took
a chance ' by entering me wnas in
the hope that the withdrawals would
ibe made Invalid.
California operators, he asserted,
are loottng the oil supplies In an
effort to get as much aa possible be
fore they are ejected. Oil worth
millions of dollars, he said, Is being
taken from government lands. Where
receivers have been placed In charge,
the government has accumulated $1,
692,000 la cash and 1,800,000 bar
rels of oil from 1,020 acres. i
