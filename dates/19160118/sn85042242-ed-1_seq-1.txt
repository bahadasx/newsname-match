exert every possible effort to send aid
to Great Britain until the war
brought' to a victorious conclusion,
was given in parliament today, first
by Sir Wilfred Laurier, leader of the

Christiania, (Norway, Jan. 17, via
London.—A third of the city of Ber­
gen, a thriving 'Norwegian seaport
with a population of 90,000, was de­
stroyed Saturday night by fire.
The fire started Saturday evening
in an ironmonger's shop and, fanned
by a hurricane, the flames spread rap­
idly and soon enveloped all the busi­
ness portion of the city.
All the largest buildings, including
hotels, newspaper offices and tele­
graph and telephone exchanges, were
destroyed. The telegraph officials
worked bravely in sending messages
until their last lines were :broken.
The firemen endeavored to circum­
scribe the area of the fire, but their
task was hopeless. In order to pre­
vent a further spread of the conflag­
ration, they finally blew up buildings
on the outer edge of the path of the
flames. Late reports say that no
lives were lost.
Two lives are reported to liav
been lost and 2,000 persons are home­
less. The property damage is said lo
be the. worst ever recorded in Nor­
way. The business section, with its
old wholesale houses, several of the
largest of the hotels, a number of
schools, the electric plant and banks
and newspaper buildings, was the
part burned.
The difficulties of the 2,000 persons
now without homes were increased
by the fact that the largest storage
houses, filled with provisions for sup­
plying the surrounding country, were
burned down. It. is harder to obtain
groceries today than at any time
since the outbreak of the war.
iBergen never was so flourishing as
at the beginning of the present year,
these conditions being due largely to
the increased merchant marine.
'Bergen is one of the oldest and
most picturesque towns in Norway,
and it ranks first of the Norwegian
ship owning centers. It is well built
On a hilly peninsula and is situated
at the end of a deep bay of the At­
lantic, 190 miles northwest of Chris­
tiania. Through Eergen passes a
large part of the foreign trade of

produce of the northern fisheries to
the seaport.

WHS THE THEME
OF DR. WEAVER
In a Speech Delivered a the Com­
mercial Club Monday
Evening.
*1 RAISED MY BOY
TO BE A SOLDIER"
Was Remark of Reverend Gentle­
man During His Interesting
Address.
America is today very much at the
mercy of any foreign nation which
may choose to take '90 days' time
from its present, difficulties to admin­
ister us a sound drubbing, in the opin­
ion of Rev. W. K. -"Weaver, vice chair­
man for Wyoming of the Navy
League of the United States, who ad­
dressed a small audience in the Com­
mercial club rooms last evening on
the subject of preparedness.
IMr.. Weaver, although his address
was decidedly militant, asserted and
reiterated that he is not for war, but
for such a state of preparedness as
shall cause any nation contemplating
forcing us into war to hestiate.
iBoy to Be a Soldier.
"1 raised my boy to be a soldier,"
said the speaker, in opening his dis­
cussion. "I'm not too proud to fight.
There 10,000 things in the world
worth fighting for. The most far
reaching harm is being promulgated
by teaching that there is nothing
worth fighting for.
"A nation which wUl-TfWWvflfffelrWuat
pass-from theface of the earth. The
seas have narrowed continents have
narrowed the world has become very
small. We occupy a prominent place
upon that small stage. We must play
the game—play it as other nations
play it, and with the same instru­
ments which other nations use."
Pays Respects to Ford.
Dr. Weaver paid his respects to the
Ford peace expedition.
"There can be no peace without
justice. Nothing is settled until set­
tled right. Any individual who would
want peace on any other basis than
justice cannot be called a man."
War Not Impossible.
We don't want war, but no think­
ing man can look at the present situ­
ation in the light of the past and say
that war is impossible. We are whol­
ly unprepared for war.
ticient in everything that
make war, except the aliilily to suf
for defeat, degradation and humilia­
tion.
"We need a larger regular army.
Our regulars have always proved loy­
al and efficient. The militia and vol­
unteers have been found just the re­
verse. Lincoln wrote confidentially,
to the governors of the various states
that if he had just J'0,000 trained men
he could have closed the Civil,war in
three weeks. If the Confederacy had
had 10,000 more trained men at Bull's
Hun it would liave captured Washing­
ton and established forever an alien
nation on American soil.
"It has been the policy of the Am­
erican government to fight its bat­
tles with volunteers. Other nations
have fought with trained soldiers.
That's why we are paying $1&0,000,
000 a year today in pensions. The
army that marched down Pennsylva­
nia avenue in 18r, or the army that.
Lee led away from Appomattax was
the equal of any army in the world,
because It had been trained, disciplin­
ed, schooled.
Navies Win Wars.
"The nation with the greatest navy
has always won. The only part of
the war of 1912 upon which we can
look back with satisfaction is made
up with brilliant victories of our na­
vy. Our 'splendid coast defenses' are
nothing. With tens of thousands of
miles of accessible coast, fortification
is impossible. If our coasts are pro­
tected at all it must be protected by
our navy. We must have a navy to
protect our commerce. I learn that
North Dakota is indifferent—that it
is too far away from the coast to be
concerned in a navy. Yet. I tell you
that if we lost control of the seas,
North Dakota would suffer more than
any other state in the union, because
more of North 'Dakota's products than
of any other state enter into export
trade. You would see your dollar
wheat dwindle to quarter wheat.
"Battleships are more economical
than battles, in both men and money.
It is imperative at this moment that
we have an adequate navy. Today
we stand fourth or fifth among naval
powers. Every other nation today has
five or six destroyers to each battle­
ship. We have about one and one
sixth. Germany has 2,200 aeroplanes,
England and France each have 2,000.

System,
Washington, Jan. 17.—Appeals for
support of an adequate national pre­
paredness policy, voiced by half a
dozen speakers, featured the opening
session of the National Civic associa­
tion.
President Low started the discus­
sion in his opening address with the
declaration that if "the United States
is to prevent the antagonisms and
hate of Europe and iis age-long tra­
dition of empires from finding lodge­
ment on this continent after the war,
it must be by the strength of our own
right arm and our willingness to die
for what is precious to humanity."
Results Revolutionary.
Whatever mffeht b'e lie outcome of
the war, Mr. Low .said, its results
could not be less than revolutionary
upon the life of the world.
"If .militarisnq. triumphs," he added,
"the Americans, like Europe, must
bow their necks to the yoke ,of a mil­
itarism which will give Ui the sol­
diers rather than to the citizens the

tailed in New York, assailed oppon­
ents of preparedness in an address
to the women's department.

Representative Gardner of Massa­
chusetts suggested that if William J.
Bryan's pacifist policy were possible,
Armenia ought to be the jolliest na­

Is Plan of Entente Allies Ships

Seized.
PROBABLY ANNOUNCED
IS FIRST TO FOR
IN VERY FEW DAYS
Washington, .Ian. 17.—Plans of the
Entente allies to declare a formal
blockade of German ports, it was
learned tonight have been the sub­
ject of exchanges between diplomatic
representatives of the Allies here and
in an informal way between the di­
plomats and officials of the state de­
partment, according to information
here. The program contemplates a
virtual extension of the blockade to
the European neutrals by rigid appli­
cation of the "ultimate destination"
doctrine, and delay in putting the
plan into effect is attributed entirely
to reluctance on the part of iFrance
and possibly. Italy to accept' the Brit­
ish right of a belligerent in this re­
spect.
Expect Blockade Soon.
Application of the blockade to neu­
trals is fully expected to result in
supplementing the opposition of the
Unned Stntes by the very bitter pro­
tests of Holland, Denmark and Swed­
en. and possibly Norway.
At present, the Allies are stopping
all commerce with the Teutonic pow­
ers directly by the orders-in-council
and are restricting indirect commerce
by .actual seizures by agreement with
countries in Northern Europe. The
promulgation of a blockade really

of rain, which lias been falling al­
most continuously since Saturday
night.
Residents were marooned at. many
places, street car and railroad traf­

today that the rain would continue
tonight and tomorrow**
Streams Above Banks.
At many points the streams have
broken from their banks, washing
away bridges and railway tracks, and
damaging thousands of acres of culti­
vated lands. Unless the rain stops
soon much more serious damage is
threatened.
No deaths or serious injuries were
believed to have occurred today, and
persons reported marooned by flood
waters- had been rescued tonight. In
Los Angeles 4.52 inches of rain had
fallen.

American Physicians
UP BANDIT LEADERS
•EI Paso, Texas, Jan. 17.—Mexico is
infected with at least 100,001) cases
of typhus fever, according to reports
to federal officials here. American
physicians, armored in silk and rub­
ber against the infected bodies and
vermin, prepared to go into the af­
flicted country with Ihe methods used
lately in Serbia, according'to an an­
nouncement today by Dr. 'Carlos
Husk, chief surgeon of the American
Smelting and iRefining company,
which normally employs 50,000 men
south of the international border.
In tbe meantime the lEl Pasa Coun­
ty Medical society, including in its
membership physicians attached to
municipal, state and national health
services, discussed tonight measures
to prevent the entrance of the dis­
ease into this country.
Capture Bandits.
Soldiers of the 115th United States
Cavalry, without, crossing the bound­
ary, aided Carranza men to capture
Col. Manuel Baca-Valles and Lieuten­
ant Colonel (Enrique Cisneros, Villa
bandit leaders, last Friday, according
to reports received here tonight by
United States authorities. The ban­
dits were executed Saturday.
Washington, Jan. 17.—Whether the
Carranza government in Mexico is to
be held responsible by the United
iStates for the death of the American
mining men slain by bandits near
Santa Ysabel may depend upon the
outcome of an investigation of a cir­
cumstantial story which reached the
state department today, telling how
the piurdered Americans had been as­
sured a safe conduct by the Carran­
za authorities. Officials indicated
clearly tonight, however, that, the evi­
dence so far was not conclusive, and
that no decision would be reached
pending a thorough inquiry. They
pointed out, also, that should Carran­
za be held responsible it would not
mean a break in this nation's rela­
tions with him, although it would re­
sult in a demand for indemnity in
addition to the punishment of the
murderers already demanded and
promised.
There was no further discussion of
Mexican affairs in congress today,
though iSenator Gore, democrat, intro­
duced a resolution to establish a neu­
tral zone along the border, policed by
Mexican and United States troops.
TO KILL AMERICANS.
Juarez, Mex., Jan. 17.—Francisca
Villa, the (Mexican chief, was at Le
Charmen, near Madera, a week ago,
according to Mexican employes of the
Pearson ranch, who arrived here to­
day. The Pearson employes also de­
clared that Villa issued an order to
his men at Rubio a few days ago to
kill all Americans, and in order to
make sure of not missing any, to kill
all foreigners..
Villa at the time had 6ft men with
him.

asked Austro'Hmigary for peace, and her request has been grant*
od. The conditional laying down of arms by Montenegro was
made the basis of the opening of peace negotiations and Montene­
gro accepted the terms imposed by the dual monarchy.
This announcement was made to the Hungarian parliament "by
Premier Tisza, and it met with an ovation on the part of the mem*
hers of the chamber. Thus comes the first withdrawal of any bel­
ligerent of either of the alliances
other since August, 1014.

Situation CrHiqrt.
It had beoH conccded fpr day» tbat
the situation of Montenegro wis. a"
critical one. Although the army of
the little kingdom fought valiantly
against the Austro-Hungarians, it
was unequalled because of inferior
forces, lack of guns and it has toeen
stated, a shortage in commissiariat
supplies, to the task of holding back
the armies that had, in conjunction
with their allies, succeeded in crash*
ing Serbia.
Already the Montenegrin capital
and many of its important towns had
fallen into the hands of the Austro*
Hungarians and the invaders were
well on their way to Montenegro's
chief seaport, Antivari.
King Nicholas in Hiding.
Last accounts had the Montenegrin
government at Scutari. The where­
abouts of King Nicholas is not
known.
The king and the government on
January 13 asked a cessation of hoe
tilities and opening of peace nego­
tiations, it was officially announced
by Austro-Hungarian headquarters to­
day.
La-' Down Arms.
The Austro-Hungarian government
replied to Montenegro that peace ne­
gotiations were only possible, if the
Montenegrin army unconditionally
laid down arms, the headquarters
statement says. The Montenegrin
government, says the statement, ac­
cepted the conditions.
Russians Make Gains..
The Russians in their drive along
the front of nearly 100 miles in the
Caucauses have won additional points
of vantage from the Turks and espe­
cially in the Arasa and Inid valley re­
gion. Constantinople admits this, but
says that south of the Arasa in h«na
to hand fighting in a Russian advance
position, heavy casualties were in­
flicted upon the Russians by the
Turks.
On the other fronts little fighting1
of moment' has taken place. The
British and French guns in France
and Belgium have been busy bom­
barding German trenches, while on
the Russians fronts there has been
fighting only at isolated points from
the Riga region to Bukowina.
The Italians through a concentrat­
ed artillery fire on trenches near
Oslavia, taken from them recently by
the Austro-Hungarians, have forced
out the invaders and again occupied
their former positions.
The French general, SarraiL
