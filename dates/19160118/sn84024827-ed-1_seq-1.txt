Motorists From Bisbee, Doug

to Homes' and Pronounce
Journey as Big Success.
From every point ot view the El
Paso excursion projected and carried
out through the Warren District Com-
mercial Club was all, that could be
asked, is the practically, unanimous j
uy.muu ui luc LurSluuliiS uu re-
turned to the District Sunday and yes-
terday. It was distinctly worth while;
and answered all the purposes inteiiG
ed, all agree.
From a business point of view th
El Paso trip was a gieat success andi
opened up an appreciation of the im-j
portance of the southern part of Ari
zona, awakeaed El Paso interest as
has never been before, j
Socially all returning excursionists i
are enthusiastic. In every way every-j
thing was done to make their trip a'
delight and the banquet was most en
joyable of any that the Bisbeeites
have ever attended.
As an outing the trip was every
thing that had been promised. The
roads were better than had been ex
pected and weather conditions, could
hardly have been better if made to
order. ' '
From the viewpoint of changing and
establishing the Borderland Route to
the benefit of Bisbee, Douglas and
Tombstone even more than had been
hoped for was done. The change Is
made,' the cut off is signed at both
ends, the road is logged and a map
of it is being made. El Paso will, put
a large sign where It will run the!
traffic this way and steps were taken
that will make a real Borderland
Route Association with commercial
organization presidents at its
and forming the directorate.

From the advertising point of view I
it has given much and will give still
more valuable publicity to the tour
ing route and to the communities
along it Much of this Is yet to come
but it brought home to hundreds of
motorists right in El Paso, that they
had been overlooking splendid oppor
tunities for motor trips and lt will
mean a growing increase In motorists
from the Pass City here in the near
future. Such a large delegation
. . ... i ,,, i
ry was an eye opener to them. It Is
not difficult with good luck to drive
between Bisbee and El Paso in 10 to
11 hours. It can be done in a day
under most any weather conditions
and certainly the run to Deming and
thence into El Paso can be finished
in a day and a half. Leaving Bisbee
at 8 o'clock and stopping for lunch
at Hachita. Deming is readily reached
In two hours. Two cars drove through
from El Paso to Douglas Sunday.
