10 Cents a 100
For Bed Bugs
Columbus. O.. Jan. 18. If any one
happens to have a hundred live er
bed bugs handy Hnd is willing to ad
mit it. 1'rof. I B. WiltberKer of tne
Ohio State university will pay a dime
for them. J'rofessor Wiltberger be
lieves they transmit trouble much as
the southern mosquito was shown to
have transmitted the yellow peril.
The existence of this new market was
disclosed to fond Columbus fathers
and mothers recently when they heard
their little boys talk of taking advan
tage of it. Others saw the professor's
ad in the local papers: "Wanted
Live bed bugs for experimental pur

berger's interest in the wingless, he
mipterous insect familiar to him as a
cimex lectularius was occasioned, he
said today, but the "peculiar ferocity
of those found in certain hostelries."
Some idea of the sort of nights the
professor passed in these places may
be gotten from his statement that
"while giving a series of lectures in an
eastern state" his trips brought him
."into such close contact with tht
pests" that he decided "their mission
in life is worse than commonly supposed."

NINE BIG REASONS
Judge Neil Tells Why Men De
sert Their Families.
Low Wages, Whisky and Char
ity the Principal Causes.
New York, Jan. 18. There are nine
leading reasons why men abandon
their wives and children. They were
set forth as follows today in the order
of their importance by Judge Henry
Neil, father of the mothers' pension
system, who in the last three years
has traveled constantly In the interest
of that cause:
Low wages, which make a home im
possible. Unemployment, which transforms a
hard working man into a discouraged
loafer.
Bad housing, especially when the j , "ave, ,l0 emlon OIf

WON'T BAIL SONS
Chicago Millionaire Says Both
in Murder Plot.
Finds One Is Secretly Wed to
Cabaret Singer.
Chicago, Jan. 18. Further investi
gation of the part taken by Herbert
Updike in the plot of his brother
Irving to kill their father was prom
ised for today by the police officers
who are co-operating with members
of the Updike family in clearing up the
! mysttery still surrounamg tne case.
! Furman D. Updike, millionaire retired
broker, the intended victim 01 tne
conspiracy, made a refusal to bail for
his sons, both of whom are in custody
charged with conspiracy to commit a
felony.
Although it was stated at the time
of the arrest that Herbert Updike was
held only as a witness, a statement by
the boy's father that he considered his
sons equally guilty and the report that
Herbert had married a Chicago
cabaret entertainer induced the po
lice to investigate further.
According to the police Herbert Up
dike, January 8, married Miss Nellye
De Onsone, a cabaret singer at Crown
Point, Ind. The authorities say a
marriage license is on file at the coun
ty clerk's office in Crown Point.
The marriage record shows that the
ceremony was performed by a Justice
of the peace. The young woman and
Herbert, however, deny that they art
married.
Furman IX Updike's statement re
garding his son Herbert's part in the
conspiracy gaiu in pari.
! and Herbert Updike were unable to
find the young men today
It was believed that the brothers
were being held either in the Oak-
park police station or in some city
police station while the police look
more closely into their confession.
The attorney who sought to give
bail for the two presented his sure
ties to the justice for approval and
said that if the young men were not
speedily forthcoming he would take
immediate steps to obtain their re
lease through the courts.

MERCY TO FOLKS
Judge Pollock Quotes Bible In
White Slave Case.
Ainsworth to Topeka Jail for
Parents' Sake.
Kansas City, Kan., Jan. 18. "For I,
the Lord thy God, am a Jealous Ood
and visit the sins of the fathers upon
the children unto the third and fourth
generation of them that hate me; and
show mercy upon thousands of them
that love me and keep my command
ments. Laws of Moses, Ex. 20:5, 6."
Judge John C. Pollock yesterday ap
plied the latter clause of the first
commandment and showed mercy, not
until H. Leo Ainsworth, who stood
before him with head bowed, but unto
his father and mother; for, applying
the first clause, it was these honest
old folks" who were suffering. The
mother wept, as did a sister who sat
back in the court room. '
"Your crime scandalized the quiet
and honor loving community of Coun
cil Grove," the Judge said. "Why the
state has failed to punish you I do not
know. Your offense is one that ex
cuses avail little in mitigating. It has
been proven that you violated the
white slave laws. The state could
have dealt with you as well, but it
saw fit to ask the government to
do so.
"Your relatives are people who have
led honest lives, but they suffer for
your crime. You suffer perhaps justly,
but they unjustly, for they committed
no wrong. However, because I have it
in my power to brand them as the
relatives of a convict I am not going
to do so. 1 am going to, for their sake,
sentence you to serve six months in
jail at Topeka and pay a fine of $2,
500." The Judge then arose and walked
into his private office. The friends of
the prisoner crowded forward to thank
him for having left him a name in
stead of giving him a number, but
the door had locked behind the judge.
This was the last criminal case on
the Kansas side docket. Ainsworth is
a gardener by occupation. He was t
convicted of taking a woman to Coun
cil Grove in violation of the Mann act.

TOO MANY; BABES
Woman's Race Suicide Theory
Lands Her in Court.
Publishes Circular to Regulate
Size of Families.
New York, Jan. 18. The trial of
Mrs. Margaret H. Sanger began today
in the federal building before Federal
Judge Clayton, where she will be
called upon to answer the charges of
disseminating literature advocating
birth control. Mrs. Banger has re
fused to have any counsel, despite the
advice of her friends and is going to
plead her own case.
At a dinner last night at the Hotel
Brevort attended by a number of her
friends, Mrs. Sanger explained what
her case will be in the trial.
"I found out." she said, "in my
nursing experience so many facts
about the over-crowding of children
and the condition of the mother and
the children that I thought something
should bo done. I found that nowhere
in this country wero there any facts
relative to the social problems as ap
plied to large families of population.
Publishes '-Woman Rebel."
"I was astonished at this, and It was
then that I began to publish the
"Woman Rebel' in order to call atten
tion to the conditions, and addressed
it to the working women of Americji
The postal authorities suppressed the
I firt rtltion
fteven editions out of
nine were suppressed and ennf iscateri
because they discussed the most inno
cent side of the subject. The legisla
tors themselves practice birth control
but will not allow others to know
about it.
"Because a thing is dangerous for
a few, is that any reaicr. why it
should be kept from the majority? I
know that knowledge in the hands of
the working girl changes her from a
silly, giggling girl to a woman able to
take care of herself. Women of the
underworld have the wrong knowledge
and ignorance is responsible for it.
If they could know it would be dif
ferent." Mrs. Stokes Indorses It.
Mrs. Rose Pastor Stokes interested
in Mrs. Sanger's defense, said to a
reporter:
The question has interested me
very much. Every one knows that
well-to-do people are breaking the
law regarding birth control all the
time and the legislators themselves
Join in that.
"We see the result In ever increas
ing numbers of children, most of
whom die. By the time the ones who
di" have been buried, with the con
sequent expense, nothing Is left for
tne otners to live on and they are
starved and miserable. I think that
birth control would regulate and end
this."
