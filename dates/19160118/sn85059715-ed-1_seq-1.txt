( V ASSOCIATED MESS)
BERLIN; Jan. 18.?A note to the
Greek government amounting to an
ultimatum is said by the Overseas
News Agency to have been presented
by France and Great Britain. Ac
cording to a Sofia despatch to the
news agency Greece Ib required to deliver
their passports to the ministers
of the central powers within fortyeight
hours, failing which the En-;
tente will take "necessary measures."
Berlin despatches of yescrday which
have not been corroborated from
French or British sources stated that
unusual measures were being takcji:
by the Allies in Greece. According to
these reports Allied troops were landed
at Phaleron. live miles southwest
of Athens, and also at Piraeus, the
port of Athens. In this connection the
Overseas News Agency of Berlin said:
"The fact that the British are
blockading the Greek coast most
tightly and are subjecting Greece to
utter inconveniences Is interpreted
by Berlin newspapers as meaning
that the Entente is preparing the
overthrow of the Greek government
to substitute a republic with Venlzelos
?.t its head."

The union anthracite mine workers
have already formulated their demands
and the convention is expected
to ratify them without much discussion.
This will leave the way open
for wide discussion on tho proposition
of adopting a basic wage scale for all
the bituminous coal fields. Then will
come the adoption of a policy thati
will affect all districts, anthracite and
bituminous. The Ohio miners have
agreed to ask for a ten per cent Increase
In wages on the mine run

adopted by the convention. Leadets
ot the union say that while Industrial
conditions are favorable for asking
higher. wages and general Improvement
In working conditions, the

will try to prevent the convention
from running wild and making
radical demands.

PNEUMONIA
Pioneer Woman. Prominent in
Educational Circles Many
Years, is Dead.
Miss "Belle" Davlsson, aged 92, a
life-long resident of the county and
a school teacher sixty-two years, died
at her home on West Main street,
near South Second street, at 10:40
o'clock Monday night. Death resulted
from.pneumonia of less than one
week's duration. Owing to an injury.
Miss Davlsson had not been out !
of her home for twelve years.
Funeral arrangements have not
been announced.
Miss Isabella M. Davlsson was'
born at Bridgeport. Va., now W. Va.,
November 10, 1829. She waa of
French-Scotch descent. Her father,
Dr. David Davlsson. came from Scotland.
Her mother, whose maiden
name was Miss Marie de-Vercom,
came front France. The father. Dr.
Davlsson. founded the old Davlsson
fort that stoo* on the site near
where the town of Bridgeport is now
located. To this union was born
sis children, three daughters and
three anna. The daughters were Ml8a
Isabolle Davlsson. Mrs. Lydlc and
Mrs. Ann Ross, who has been dead
several years. The sons were Dr. De
Vecom Davlsson, Armstrong Davlsson
and Col. A. P. Davlsson. an attorney.
Mrs. P. E. Lydlc, a sister, i
Is the only surviving member of the j
Immediate family.
Soon after Miss Belle Davlsson was [
horn the family moved to Clarksburg
and were located on the same ground
where the old home now stands, at
the corner of West Main and South
Second streets.
Miss Isgbelle Davlsson received.
her early education in the old Clacks-1
burg academy. While a student:
there she was engaged In helping
the teachers. She, with the Rev; J. i
H, McMechen, a Methodist .minister.!
founded the first Clarksburg semi-,
nary. Later she taught In Greene:
county. Pa.; Allegheny county, Md.-,
Monongalia and Marlon counties, W.
Va., then Va.
In 1850 Miss Davisson started a
private school In Clarksburg in the
building on South Second street
which Is nqw occupied by Dr. ,C. R.
Peck. In 18(17 she began teaching In
the public schools of Clarksburg,
where she remained until 1893. She
again conducted a private school at
her home, corner of South Second
and West Main streets. In all she
rounded out a school career of sixty
I wo years or acure worn, c/ven ill IVI
she became an invalid she was engaged
in teaching quite frequently.
Among some of the prominent persons
who were students of Miss Davisson
are United States Senator Nathan
Goff, R. T. Lowndes. Mortimer
W. Smith, Sr., and Charles Reynolds.
In fact, nearly every prominent
family In the city has one or
more members who at one time was
a student of "Miss Belle's."
Miss Davlsson was a member of
the First Methodist Episcopal church
and when her health permitted, she
was active In church work.
Miss Alclnda Davlsson, a niece of
Miss Belle, who came to live with the
family when but one year old, carried
meals to Miss Belle for these twelve
years. During all her sickness Miss
Alclnda tells of the cheerfulness of
Miss Belle, of how she took an in-1
terest in all her friends; asking how
her former students were progressing
in their business and professional
lives?and what the boys and girls
-? In lkAl? OellAAl
ui luuuy were uuiug ?u vucu ovuw?
wor. Only a few days ago she
asked a lad If he was learning his
lessons. These are only a few of
the characteristics and sterling qualities
of the woman. In her passing
Clarksburg has lost one whose life
has for nearly a century cast a bright
ray of sunshine in the homeB of everyone
who knew her. The example
of her beautiful and lovable life is,
however, shining on. It will still
shine on and linger in the minds of
those friends as a light that never
ceases to burn.
