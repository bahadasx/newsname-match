JJIT CHICOPEE
HiJ SCHOOL
Springfield Suburb Suffers Loss
of $200,000 Building
ORIGIN NOT YET DETERMINED
Only $80,000 of the Lota is Covered
By Insurance New Addition Was
Lately Completed.
Springfield, Mass., Jan. 18. Fire of
unknown origin totally destroyed the
Chicopee high school 1)uildlugs early
yesterday morning. The loss is esti
mated at close to $200,000. The
buildings destroyed, wero the old high
school , building, the manual training
building and the new addition, that
was almost completed," to connect the
other two. About fO.000 of the loss
is covered by insurance. The alarm
for the Are was turned in at 5.27 o'
clock yesterday morning after the fire
had at least a half-hour's start.
The lire is thought to have started
in the manual training room at the
back of the building but its origin Is
mysterious. That part of the build
ing is heated from the municipal elec
tric light plant and Its wiring Is
known to have been installed with an
extra amount of care, so it Is im
probable that the fire started from de
fective wiring or from the heating
system. The building had no night
watchman, and tho last person known
to have been in it was the Janitor,
Frank J. Lynch, who left the building
about '3 o'clock Sunday afternoon.
Tho fire was discovered by James
Love, night watchman for tho Burt
worth carpet company, and Ludwlg
Bus, an employe of the municipal
lighting plant, who noticed the flames
just before 5.30 v o'clock . yesterday
morning. It Js not thought likely that
spontaneous- combustion caused the
flrajis the rooins In, the old, building
were cleaned thoroughly every da v.
Members" of the school committee
said, last evening. that while the mat
ter was ; ultimately one for, 'tli city
solicitor 'and; the Insurance adjusters
to" decfde.'it'was probable " that the
pity would have to stand all the loss
not Covered by insurance. J. J. Page
& Son, the' contractors in charge of
erecting the addition, have been paid
for the work that they have done as
It has been completed.

8CHOOL3 AFTER THE FIRE
Night School at High School Will Be
Omitted Until Building Is Repaired
There is to be no session of even
ing school until repairs are completed
on the high school.
Owing to the extra work connected
with the transfer of the pupils and
the division Of the day school into
different buildings, it has been
thought best to wait before plans can
be formulated caring for evening
classes. Just what effect this forced
recess will have on the dismissal
of night school in the spring will bo
announced later.
The high school started sessions
with littje confusion, but much crowd
ing in the School Btreet graded build
ing this morning, over 250 pupils be
ing jammed in on the top floor of the
building, while down stairs the kids
were packed into the rooms like ear
dines. The transfer of the school to
the third floor of the graded school
has been designated by tho faculty
as "Tho Passing of the Third Floor
Back." . ' ,
Practically all of the books and
class-room equipment wero not badly
damaged by fire or water and were in
use this morning, having been trans
ferred Monday afternoon by high
school boys 'who volunteered their
services.
The teacher training class is in
stalled at St. Francis de Sales
Academy and the classes in music
will be heard at St. Peter's parish
house. On the whole the Bchool is
running In better ahape than seemed
possible, due mainly to the executive
ability of Supt. Varney.
Sightseers; who went to ' the high
school yesterday afternoon to view
the ruins from tho street wero disap
pointed, for with the exception of a
few smashed windows, the outside of
the building did not suffer noticeably.
Workmen, assisted by the boys,
w orked on the floors all day yesterday
and at five o'clock had most of the
debris removed aijd the water mopped
outj The inside of the building is in
bad shape in the part hit by the fire.
The high school boys did excellent
work In' removing tho charred and
watcr-scaked material still holding
the water of the night before and al
lowing it to drip down to tbo further
dottructlon of plaster and equipment
beneath. The boys were given pay
per hour and did as well if not better
than the men. ' " ' , ' '
Work was started Monday in tem
porarily fixing the roof with lumber
and roof paper. This will be finished
today and the building. which is now
water-logged, can bo dried outJ. " The
Insurance adjusters are to : be here
Thursday. ?t i
At the graded school building one
of the first things today was to, give
each room careful flro instruction so
that the Increased number of pupils
could be gotten out quickly in case of
an alarm.

IRELAND AGAIN EXCLUDED
Some Irish Members Wanted Con
scription There.
London, Jan. 17. Tho proceedings
in committee in the House of Com
mons today resulted in no modificat
ion of the Military Service bill. The
Government strongly resisted an at
tempt to include married men in the
scope of the bill.
The most Important amendment
sought to include Ireland, This also
was negatived without division after
a not very exciting debate, in which
John Redmond, leader of the Irish Na
tionalists, eloquently appealed to the
House not to endanger Ireland's loy
alty, displayed by her recruiting cam
paign, by an attempt to employ force.
The only amendment accepted was
one providing that men married be
fore Nov. 2 the day Premier Asqulth
gave his pledge should be regarded
under the bill as married men. An
Amendment that the bill .should not
apply to single men above tho age of
thirty years was defeated.
Irish members made the appeal for
tho Inclusion of Ireland in the pro
visions of the bill, by James Cham
bers of the Southern Division of Bel
fast introducing a motion to that ef
fect, and James Craig, of the1 Eastern
Division of Down, supporting it ! !
A Bonar Law, Secretary for tho
Colonies, who is In charge of the
bill, expressed regret that Mr. Red
mond had not been able to take the
course suggested by Messrs. Chamb
ers and Craig. t
"It is a great thing to know that
for the first time In history the official
representatives of the Irish Party are
openly and avowodly with us In the
conduct of the war,"
Sir Edward Carson advised Mr.
Chambers, in view of . Mr. Law's
speech, not to pass his amendment,
which, he said, would merely delay
tho bill.
Mr. Redmond said tho simple fact
was that conscription ; In Ireland
would be unworkable and impossible.
It would paraly2e tho efforts of him
self and others who had labored 'in
cessantly and not unsuccessfully to
help on the war. To includo Irdland
under the bill, ho said, would be to
play Into the hands of , a "contempt
ible rdlnority of, Nationalists la Ire
land who. are -trying to.preyn, recruit
ing and 'undeWnine the Irish Party."
DRJ SAMUEL A. PARRINE.V
To Lecture at the i Baptist Church
j Next Friday Night.
Dr. Samuel Alden Perrine. who lec
tures for the Geographical society of
New ' York, will give an illustrated
lecture on "Tho Glories of India" in
tho auditorium of the First Baptist
church Friday evening, Jan. 21 at
8.15. For ten long years Dr. Perrine
lived and labored and traveled in the
orient, hence these lectures are not at
all like tho ordinary travel talks
based on observation from an express
train of an hour's visit to so called
points of Interest. With his pleasing
personality, splendid power of de
scription, perfect enunciation, ade
quate voice, keen sense of humor and
appreciation of the serious and vital
things of life, he takes us farther in
an hour and a half, we see more,
learn more and really enjoy as much
as in weeks of travel among these
same actual scenes in the little
known lands of the East Illustrat
ed by superbly colored scenes, includ
ing some of the strangest and most
marvelous art photographs ever made
and by curios and stranco exhibits.
Tickets on sale at 35c. by ladles of

AFTER FIVE YEARS
Bennington Testimony Remains
Unshaken.
This is tho best test of truth.
Here is a Bennington story that has
stood tho test of time. It is a story
with a point which will come straight
home to many of us.
R. J. Taylor, Bennington, says:
"For several years, I had backache,
directly over my kidneys. It came
and went at regular intervals at first,
but for the last two or three years, it
annoyed me almost constantly. Then
I had headaches and dizziness and a
cold always made me worse. I was
compelled to pas's the kidney secre
tions too often. I was advised to try
Doan's Kidney Pills and I procured
them at Cole's Drug Store. They did
me a great deal of good soon after
I commenced taking them. The pain
In my back left and the other troubles
were removed."
OYER FIVE YEARS LATER, Mr.
Taylor said: "Time has not altered
my high regard for Doan's Kidney
Pills and I willingly endorse them
again. For some years I have been
free from kidney trouble."
Price 50c, at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
Mr. Taylor has twice publicly recoin
mended. Foster-Milburn Co., Props.,

ALLIES TO FORCE
GREECE TO FIRE
Ml TEUTONS
Allies Have Sent Wo'd and Now
Back Up Demands
TROOPS LAND NEAR ATHENS
England and Franca Will Compel
Greece to Expell all Representa
tives of the Central Powers.
Sofia, Jan. 18.Greece . has re
ceived word from, England and
Franco that she must, expel all Teu
tons and all representatives and
agents of the central powers and Bul
garia and Turkey. To enforce their
demand French and British troops
have been landed five miles from
Athens.
Thin new violation of Greek neu
trality has stirred Athens more than
any other event of the war and there
is much bitter talk of opposing this
new insult.
Inasmuch, however, as Greece is
compelled to import most of her food
stuffs and the Greek ports- are block
aded by allied warships it Is expected
that she will be compelled to submit
to the demand.
Berlin, Jan. 17. (by Wireless to Say
villo, N. Y.) News that Allied troops
have been landed at i! Phaleron, five
miles southwest of Athens, is contain
ed In comment on tyls action by the
Berlin papers, as recorded In the fol
lowing statement gfven out by the
Overseas News AgoiScy .
''Berlin newspapers, commenting on
the latest news ' regarding Greece,
tnito in stating that the -, Entente
seems to have abandoned all regard
for Greek neutrality and ' sovereigni
ty. The landing at Phaleron is con
sidered as, proof, that the Entente is
now going to uso extreme means for
forcing, Greece, , ; ,;, Ktr 1 ;r
j "According to private reports the
Greeki Government has transferred
part pf the State archives to Larissa,
In Northwestern. Gneece, where even
tually the Greok Government likewise
will be transferred . : : :
: "The fact that - tHe British are
blockading the Greek coast most
tightly and are subjecting Greece to
other inconveniences ' is interpreted
by the papers as meaning that the
Entente Is fomenting and preparing
the overthrow of the Greek Govern
ment in order to substitute a republic
with Venizelos at its head.
"Gratitude is unanimously express
ed by the newspapers that the eutlre
army and the majority of the Greek
population are on the King's aide, and
will frustrate all attempts against tho
country's sovereignty and the King's
life.
"The ' Zeitung Am Mittae- declares
that the Entente Intends the assassi
nation of a country which refuses to
commit suicide."
, Athens, Jan. 17, via London.) The
Greek Government, in agreement with
the King, will proclaim martial law
tills week according to the newspaper
Kainros. Tho Parliament, which will
meet next Monday, is expected to rati
fy this measure. n- .
Prince Andrew of Greece, brother
of King Constantine, left Athens yes
terday for Saloniki to join his regi
ment. He was accompaled by Prin
cess Alice.
Prince Alexander of Serbia has ar
rived at Corfu.
Washington, Jan. 18. A dispatch to
tho Austro-Hungarian embassy yester
day from Baron Burlan, foreign minis
ter at Vienna, said: "During the
sitting of the Budapest Parliament
Minister President Count Tlsza de
clared: 'The King and government
of Montenegro have requested tho in
troduction of negotiations for peace
Whereupon we asked absolute surren
der of arms. At this moment I recelv
ed a communication stating that Mon
tenegro had accepted absolute surren
der, and consequently after realiza
tion of the .capitulation negotiations
for peace can begin.' "
A dispatch from. Rome on Saturday
said the Montenegrin authorities of
ficially denied that Montenegro had
ever adhered to or Intended to adhere
to any separate proposal of peace or
to any armistice with Austria. It
was declared, added the dispatch, that
King Nicholas and his army and peo
ple would continue to fight till 1'e
last man.
The announcement that Montene
gro has asked for peace, if accurate,
marks the first known definite step
taken by any of the belligerents' In the
European war toward the making of
peace.
Montenegro entorod the war on
August 8, 1914, when the government
of the country Informed the Austrian
minister at Vienna that Montenegro
considered herself In a state of war
with Austria. For more than a year
after war was declared Montenegro
was comparatively free from hostile
operations and in fact tho Montene
grins themselves pushed Into Aus
trlan territory and for months hold
positions outside their frontier. The
real drive against Montenegro began
in October of last year, almost simul
taneously with the beginning of the
Teutonic and Bulgarian operations
that resulted !u the crushing of Sep
via.
