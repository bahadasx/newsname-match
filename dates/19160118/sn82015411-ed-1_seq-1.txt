THE SCHOONER PROSPER
WERGKED AT PORT ALLEI
Trim Lumber Vessel Loses Anchorage I n
Kona Storm Sunday Afternoon And Is
Beached At Mouth of Hanapepe River
Back Believed Broken British Yeoman
Has Second Narrow Escape In Three Weeks
The American schooner Prosuer,
Captain Murchison, which arrived
at Port Allen a few days ago with
a cargo of lumber for the Kauai
Railway Company, is a wreck at
the mouth of Hanapepe river, in
side of Hanapepe Hay. about a
quarter of a mile from Port Allen
boat landing, having dragged her
anchors opposite the Port Allen
landing Sunday afternoon, after
which she was purposely steered
for the mud flat at the mouth of
the river to escape complete disas
ter on the breakwater.
Her keel is gone and, worst of
all, it is believed that her back is
broken, on which latter account it
would likely be next to impossible
to take her to a drydock.
She will probably ultimately be
sold and broken up where she lies.
This, however, will be a matter to
be determined after a more careful
survey bv experts.
The tinted States Lighthouse
Tender Columbine went aro'und
from Hanatnaulu to Port Allen
yesterday afternoon and towed the
bark British Yeoman out beyond
the heavy surf, where she was
anchored, the Columbine taking
up a position nearby to tender any
assistance that might be necessary.

the steamer Wailele, which had
left Honolulu at about 10 o'clock
in the morning, arrived off Poit
Allen, got a line on the British
Yeoman and began towing her to
sea. The Columbine picked up
the bark outside and left with her
for Honolulu (the Wailele coming
I around to Nawiliwih to take the
j mail.) where, the intention is,
she will he put into drvdock.What
the fate of the steamer and her tow
were during the night, however,
is not yet known here, but certain
it is that they struck into one ot
the worst gales that has prevailed
in this channel in a long while.
The schooner Prosper seems to
be in abnit the same position in
Hanapepe I3av this morning. She
may never be saved, except in
pieces.
At noon Sundav the bark Hritish
Yeoman and the .schooner Prosper
were lying straight off and a little
seaward of the Port Allen break
water. The kona wind had been
blowing strong for hours, and roll
ers of great height and force had
been entering the broad mouth of
the bav, the two vessels rolling
considerably and drawing hard
upon their anchors.
About two o'clock in the after
noon the Prosper lost one of her
anchors and began to swing around
to port. She got out a line and

DATES CHANGED
All AUTO CRASHES
NTO CAE CARS
The railway crossing on the Na
wiliwili side of Hotel Lihue is res
pons'ble for .another bad automo
bile accident, which occurred last
Tuesday evening just after dark,
and came neir resulting seriouslv
to two men.
The car belonged to Albert Hor
ner. Jr., of Kapaa, and was being
driven by him. With him in the
front seat was E. W. Carden. of
the Lihue bank. The voting men
had been down to Nawiliwih to
superintend the embarking o f
shipments bv the steamer of that
afternoon.
The car had rounded the last
turn into Lihue and was approach
ing the hotel it an average speed.
When within a very short distance
of the railway crossing, a train of
cars suddenly emerged from the
cane field and were being backed
across the road. The auto was too
close to escape collision and in a
second there was a crash, the ma
chine driving in between two cars,
knocking both from the track.
The speed of the auto had been
slightly checked, and both Horner
and Carden, being light and athlet
ic, sprang from it. Both were
bruised, however, in addition to
which. Carden received a gash on
the chin and both of his arms weie
slightlv sprained, The car had a
remarkable escape, being much
less injured than might reasonably
be supposed. .
It is stated that a flag man was
present at the time, but was not
at his post of duty on the road and
no warning of the approaching
train whatever was given.
A mail wagon met with a simi
lai accident at the same i rossing
some niontas ago.
Iff TOURS
Superintendent Ileniv Wals
worth Kinney, of the Department
of Kduc.ition, arrived on Kauai
and in the time to Saturday com
pleted a tour of all the schools of
the island, returning to Honolulu
Saturday night. While here he
was the guest of Commissioner and
Mrs. Knudsen, of Kekaha, and
Supervising Principal and Mrs.
Brodie, of Hanapepe. Owing to
the bad weather, travelling was
not over pleasant while the super
intendent was here, particularly
on the Hanalei side.
Before leaving Mr. Kinnev ex
pressed himself as well satisfied
with conditions as he found them
o n Kauai, although numerous
minor improvements here and thee
will be supported.
Mr. Kinney wins particularly
well pleased with the Kauai High
& Grammar School, which h e
found had developed in the short
time of a year and a half from a
small beginning into quite a lusty
institution.

CROOL
STORi TEARS OFF
STAND ROOF
During the hard blow from the
south Sunday night the top of the
fine grandstand in Lihue park was
ripped off ami liteially scattered to
the four winds. The front fell
forward and crashed to pieces on
the ground below. Parts of the
roof fell back of the grandstand,
but most of it was scattered across
the patk as far as the cine field of
I.ihue plantation. T h e interior
timbers of the structure were torn
looc, but are not damaged to the
extent that they mav not be used
again. The floor of the building
and seating arrangement were not
disturbed.
All over Lihue, Grove Farm,
Nawiliwili, Ntunialu a n d other
neighborhood sections trees were
blown down or broken, and soim
buildings were damaged, although
there was less injury to propert
than might have been supposed.
Along the coast from Lihue tr
the Mann end of the island tlr
wind was very high. At Wnime:.
a number of trees were blown
down, but no property damage is
reported. Concern was felt fot
the Wainiea wharf, but the strnc
turc weathered the gale in fine
style.
Exceedinglv rough seas prevail
ed all along the south cojst of the
island and it was quite fortunate
that all ot the ports were clear of
the small island steamers.

End Of Storm?
Th kona storm which had rag
ed since Saturday, or lonirer, took
one final .slap at the entiie south
side and Lihue end of the island
between 1:20 and 3 o'clock this
morning. There was lightning,
thunder and rain, while the wind
was at the velecitv ot a nalo.
Numerous trees
along the coast
;ind in Lihue were thrown down-
otably a ,,jR one wllicl) ,ies acrQSS
tlie roatt above Nawimvil, several
in the Hotel Lihue yard and five
of the fine, old trees in the grove
of Lihue Union church.
The wind then started to shift
slowly around toward the west
and this morning the sun came
out as bright and clear as though
nothing had happened. At this
writing ( 10 o'clock), however, the
skv is again evcrcast with threat
ening clouds, and the condition
of the Uterometer indicates that
the stern may not yet be entirely
ovtr, although the worst has prob-
ably passed.
