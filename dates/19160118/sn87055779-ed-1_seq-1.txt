MODEL
TO BE ERECTED
(iiic more Krade school, the land
for which will be purchased within
the next few weeks, is to be added
to South llend's 1 ) grade schools
that are now hi operation. Work on
the building will be started in the
spring or in the early part of the
summer. It will be built on W.
Sample .st., near the city limits,
where the .Sample st, portable
schools are now situated.
Tive acres of land for the build
ii U and other improvements in that
section of the city will be bought by
the school board, an appropriation
for which will be taken up with the
city council either at tonight's meet
ing of the committee of the whole
or as soon after as possible. The
land is owned by J. D. Oliver.
Will IJc One Story.
According to present plans the
building will be one of the most
modern in the United States and will
cost between $75.000 and $100,000.
ll will be only one story high, one
of the few of its kind in the coun
try. Owing to the new uses that
are being put to school buildings,
such as community center work, the
new structure will be equipped to
suit every possible need.
One of the features of the new
luildintf. something that no other
trade school in the city has, will be
a complete gymnasium. This part
of the building will be used not only
by the pupils at the school for
physical training, hut for the ath
letic end of the community center
ork.
I-irse Auditorium.
A large auditorium that will seat
hundreds of people will be located
In another part of the building. It
will be used for special exercises that
come during the school year and for
civic club and community center
meetings.
Complete manual training and do
mestic science equipment will be in
stalled, lake the gymnasium and
auditorium, these departments will
be used hy the students and people
of the district alike. The installation
of a regular system of vocational
training for adults in the local edu
cational system has made this equip
nent necessary, according to one of.
the members of the school board.
The building itself probably will
rot cover more than u third or u
half of the ground that will he pur
chased, but the remainder will be
used for playgrounds, gardens and
ether things that have come to be
necessary around a school building.
Appropriate Name.
ome name that is appropriate to
an event that has made history in
this part of the country will he given
to the structure. The Indiana His
torical commission, which Is in
charge of the centennial celebration,
has suüizested that all public build
ups erected in UUO. the U't'th an
niversary of the admission of In
diana union, e civen a name con
r.ectid with history.
Lasalle or Kankakee has been sug
gested to the school board as the
name for the building. It will be
located not far from the headwaters
oi' the Kankakee, in which Lasalle
was the l.rst white man to put a
c anoe.
YUitctl Other ilie.
For the past few months the men.
ocr.s of the school board have been
investigating school buildings in a'l
parts of the country. One of the
members of the board has gone as
far east a New York state to look
over one of the modern buildings
there. Michigan City and Kvans
ton. III., have huildings. after which
the latest addition to the school city
may ' e patterned.
Several sets' of dans have already
been received by the board, but
r.or.e of them ha been de.'Initely de
cided upon by the members. The
spe itic.ttions carry them stimutes

neys for the cities of .outh Hend

for another postponement before
the public service commission that
they miht prolong their conference

It is thought some agreement will

The reason for the sudden attempt
of the utility and city ollicials inter
ested to compromise is a story worth
telling.
Tonintlic Value Fixed.
The tentative valuation of the
property of the company has been
tixed by the engineers of the com
mission and it is far below the
(Hided and other indebtedness of the
lighting company, according to In
formation received. The city of
South Hend and others supplied by
the company are dependent on such
extension of service as the company
may make, and the company, under
the utilities law, is dependent on its
own tinancial condition and what
tlie commission will allow it to issue
in the way of securities for what-
.er extensions it hereafter may
make with its indebtedness above its
actual value.
Future issue of securities for ex
tension purposes probably would not
brln.T sums c!';.': enough to par to
allow the company to make such
extensions, it was argued. There
fore a scheme to agree on a com
promise rate was urged and thus
take the entire matter out of the
jurisdiction of the commission for
the time being, thus allowing the
commission to issue an order ap
proving the compromise rate, was
evolved and this was explained to
the commission at Monday's hear
in ff.
Ilolievc it For IW-t.
If such a compromise rate is
agreed on, it has been the policy of
the commission to approve such
agreements, therehy wiping out the
effect of the commission's tentative

as it may be brought up again by
some other complainant. That this
scheme will insure possibility of ex

UI, PASO. Tcx'as. Jan. is. With
his back to a eottonwood tree be
hind which his hands were tied with
heavy rope. Col. Miguel Baca-Valles,
otti' ial executioner of the Villa
army, was shot lo death in Juarez
by a Carranza tiring squad at 5 a.
m. today. The execution took place
at a point one hundred yards from
the National Railway; station, where
stood a special train tilled with
American refugees from Mexico
which had arrived a few hours
earlier.
Col. Haca-Valles was put to death,
after conviction by a court martial
on the charge of having taken part!
in the massacre of American citizens
near Santa Ysabel a week ago Mon
day. While Raca-Valles was being ex
ecuted the body of Gen. Jose Ro
driguez, another Villista leader, lay
in a freight car nearby awaiting the
i hour set hy the Carranza official
with a stoicism characteristic of his
Indian ancestry. Knowing that he
was doomed to death immediately
after his arrival in Juarez, lie
smoked cigarets incessantly during
the night, hut the only words he ut
tered in the hearing of his guards
were:
"May God be merciful to me."
In the darkest hour of the morn
ing, just before dawn. Raca-Valles
was led out of a water tank station
by a squad of 20 Carranzista soldiers
commanded by Capt. Alejandro
J Reginio. The prisoner had been
under guard at the tank station for
five hours.
When the execution squad arrived
Col. Raca-Valles rose heavily to his
feet, cast away his last cigaret and
came out of his prison, but without a.
word of protest. Two blocks away,
on the bank of a muddy Irr nation
cnnal, stood a large cottonwoo.a tree.
To this marched the firing squad
with the prisoner, hands bound, in
it2 center.
Wears Coat Sweater.
Through the morning mi.ct elec
tric lights twinkled from the railway
station. The air was chill, but ih
prisoner did not shiver, lacking a
coat, he wore instead a grey coat
sweater. Once on the fhort march
Raca-Valles stumbled and almost
fell, but recovered quickly and look
ed about him as if to see if any nf
his guards thought he was weaken
ing". Arriving at the tree the .obliers
bound their prisoner to its trunk by
! the order of Capt. Reginio. who then
stepped up to Raca-Valles and asked
if he wished a handkerchief placed
over his eyes. The prisoner rejdi'd:
"No me importa. No soy co
barde." (It do-sn"t matter to me,
I'm no co w a rd.
The handkerchief was left off.
As Raca-Valles stood atrainst
