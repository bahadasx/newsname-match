Are Becoming Tame.
El Paso, Tex.. Jan. 18.—Col. Miguel
Vailes, bandit chief captured at Palo
mas, south of Columbus, N. M., was
executed at 5 o'clock this morning by
a firing squad at Juaret.
Two bullets fired at close quarters
penetrated his heart, after he had de
clared he was not responsible for the
robberies of Villa, and he had pleaded
to see Gen. Gaviera, Carranza com
mandant.
Lieutenant Colonel Enrique Cisne
ros, who was captured last week with
Vallee, Is being marched overland
with eight followers, caught with him,
and, according to Mexican officials,
also will be placed promptly before
the firing squad and be executed.
Another Bandit Stain.
Baca Valles arrived here last night
aboard a train which brought a body
declared to be that of Jose Roder
giies, bandit chief, executed near Ma
dera last Thursday. The two bodies
later were taken to the Mexican cus
toms house here to be viewed by
Americans, who had expressed doubt
i»t» tit* identity tpv^titsa executed
as Rodergues.
Baca Valles. who was known as
Villa's moSt .callous execution** at
ares, was taksii from the box Car
in which he arrived, a ftm minutes
before 6 o'clock. He was marched
through the dimly lighted, platform
of the railway station, where many
families spend their nights.
Executions had been so frequent in
fuares In the final days of the Villa
regime, however, that not a ripple of
interest was shown.
Proceedings Brief.
The proceedings were brief. The
rlsoner said:
"I am not responsible for the acts
nd robberies of Villa. I beg to see
•owr general."
'The officer commanding the firing
•1711 ad said he had orders to kill, and.
lie and a soldier stepped close to Baca
Valles, fired point blank into the
prisoner's heart.
The body was taken back to the
railroad station, where it lav uncov

kets.
Refuse Transport XUghts.
Douglas, Arts., Jan. 18.—The state
department at Washington has denied
a request of the de ficto Mexican
government that 600 cavalry troops be
permitted to cross United States terri
tory from Naco, Ariz., to El Paso to
aid in running down bandits in the
state of Chihuahua, it was announced
here yesterday by Ives G. Lellvier,
Mexican consul. The refusal, he said,
was based on the excited condition of
residents in El Paso.
Permit Departure.
El Paso, Tex., Jan. 18.—Maximo
Castillo and Jesus San Martin, the
Mexicans who in numerous affidavits
were held responsible for the firing' of
Cumbre tunnel, in Mexico, in which
21 American passengers aboard a
railroad train were byrned to death
over a year ago, were on the way to
New Orleans yesterday to take ship
for Cuba. The men had been in the
hands of United States authorities
since April, 1914, first as military pris
oners at Fort Bliss, and then as un
desirable aliens in the hands of' the
immigration officials'.
They were permitted to go to Cuba
because It was feared that deportation
to Mexico would meat! execution by
agents of either Carranza or Villa.
The affidavits concerning the burn
ing of the Cumbre tunnel, into which
a loaded passenger train ran and nev
er emerged, declared Castillo ind Han
Martin led the party which fired the
bore. The affidavits were made by
American railroad men, but United
States authorities did not consider the
evidence sufficient and merely charg
ed the men with having violated im
migration laws.

He also declared that while there

In Canada, he did not think it would
be necessary to have oonsorlptlon

of French-Canadian nationalists in
Quebec who were opposed to Can
adian aid to the motherland. He
promised the support of the opposi

Berlin Sees Concession of Final
Defeat in Montenegro's Decesion
To Accept Separate Peace Offer
Sir Robert Borden expressed con
fidence in the eventual succsm of the
allies, for, although the balance of the
land successes appeared to be on the
side of the Germans so far, they had
been held and time for preparation
afforded the entente allies to nieet the
preparations which Germany had
been making for years.'
Sir Robert informed parliament that
Canada had reason to feel proud of
the men Mnt, who Just nine months
after the time they had left vocations'
of peace, had met and more than held
their own against superior numbers
of Germans.
Berlin, Jan. 18.—"Berlin newspapers," says the
Overseas agency, "in expressing satisfaction over the
surrender of Montenegro, point to the political abilities
of King Nicholas, and recall that the fact that the em
peror of Russia called him 'his unique friend.'
CANADA READY

Speakers at Ottawa Indicate
Intention of Fighting
It is argued by the press in its comment that if
King Nicholas was inclined to follow the example of
King Peter of Serbia, who at his home in the Italian
palace, they say, awaits the final victory of his allies
after having been deserted by them, the reason is that
he considers the entente cause lost.
The newspapers also now find an explanation for
the nervous agitation at the Italian court during the
last few days, it being thought probable that the heir
apparent to the Montenegrin throne, Prince Danilo
Alexander, was preparing his relatives there for the
event about to take place.
They declare also that it is now perfectly clear
that the extreme measures taken by the entente pow
ers against Greece were in order to weaken the im
pression which the Montenegrin catastrophe would
cause.

Ottawa, Jan. 18.—The determina
tion of Canada to continue to exert
every possfftM effort to send aid to
Great Britain until the war ls brought
to a victorious conclusion was given
expression in parliament yesterday,
first by Sir Wilfred Laurler, leader of
the opposition and then by Sir Robert
Borden, the premier. The two leaders
declared that while war continued in
Europe there shall be no political
questions fought out in Canada.
Sir Wilfried Ijaurier declared that
German successes upon-land had been
more than offset by the silent success
of the British navy at sea where,
without a major action, the waiting
fleet under Jelllco had rendered the
German navy as Ineffective as if it
had been sent to the bottom.
He said there would be no con
scription in Canada, but added that
if there were there would be no rea
son to anticipate an exodus of Ameri
can settlers from Canada to escape It.
American settlers in Canada, he said,
had shown no hesitation in. joining
the Canadian forces and there were
today many hundreds of men of
American birth serving with the Can
adiCis on the battlefields of Europe
and many hundreds more In training,
in England.

Formal Announcement of
Succc&ful Use of Serum
in Wounds.
Paris. Jan. 18.—Dr. Pierre Roux,
director of the Pasteur institute, an
nounced today to the academy of sci
ences that a remarkable advance in
serumtherapy has been made as the
result of a discovery b.v Dr. Bassuet.
By His method, it is possible to
cleanse automatically, Dr. Roux said,
wounds which hitherto had resisted
treatment. Pr. Bassuet ornpioys poly
valent serum, discovered last year by
Drs. IjeCIainche and Valle.
Roux said 420 wounded men, who
had been in hospitals from 6 to 14
months, were treated according to
the Bassuet method.
As a result infection seemed to re
vive in the wounds. Absesses formed,
burst spontaneously, eliminating bits
of bone, splinters, bullets, pieces of
clothing and even drains and silver
threads, left in incision by mistake.
After thia had happened, Roux said,
the wounds healed quickly in most
cases and men who had been lying
helpless for months were discharged
as cured.

Hammond urged that the proposed

the country's present naval, military
budget be looked upon as "a Business
Investment, an insurance—not always
effectual against war—but which will
at least minimize the distress incident
to war."'
Hammond asserted that the present

Sensational Story by Stand
ard Tank Commander
is Investigated.
Washington, Jan. 18.—State depart
ment officials admitted today that they
are investigating an affidavit by Cap
tain Thompson of the Standard Oil
tank steamer Petrolite. which makes
a sensational report of how an Aus'
than submarine on December a fired
upon and stopped the tanker off Alex
andria. Egypt, and removed supplies.
Captain Thompson's affidavit, istate
department officials say. does not give
all the facts they will need to pursue
the case, but it is said to declare that
fourteen shots were fired at the ship,
one of which crashed into the engine
room and Injured a Danish seaman:
and that the submarine commander
took one of the Petrolite's crew
aboard the submersible and held him
as a hostage while he obtained pre
visions from the steamer.
When details of what warning was
given the ship and what her response
to the warning shots was are received,
the case will be taken up further. A
warship has a right to take provisions
from a merchant ship under certain
circumstances. What these were in
the present case has not been cleared

USE SUB BOATS

New York, Jan. 18.—That it would

navy yard, to the citizens' committee
for food shipments.
'If the submarine were construct
ed for the purpose," said Lieutenant
Commander Craft, "there is no scien
tific .reason why It could not make
a voyage across the Atlantic with a

marine for blockade running is new,
but practicable."
