The first Hi-p?that of instituting
? ondfinnation proceedings?was taken
i" tin- following out the advice of
Mr. Pollard, when a resolution intro
?meed by Councilman Knglisl. was
recommended to the Hoard of Alder
!ii<-n for adoption.
It was received by the M.,ard of Al
dermen at a meeting last night and
re'et red to the Committee- on Finance.
President William 11 White, of the
Richmond. Fredericksburg and Po
tomac Railroad, and Kppa Hunton. Jr.
attorney for the company, objected to
!h>- adoption of the resolution. Mr.
Hunton said that condemnation pro
ceedings w.-re unnecessary, as the rail
'road company was ready to dedicate
the rights of way o\<*r the tracks for
,the extension of Monument Avenue'
l provided that the "Revised llanklns
j Plan was accepted by the city.
After the resolution was adopted Mr
Hunton said that the company re-'
i served the t ight to withdraw its offer
?to dedicate the rights necessary to
extend -Monument Avenue.

I would advise for adoption, which calls1

Mr. Hunton replied to this by saving

remaining question was one of (>x.

that in ordinary elections only fit! ;.???

ami that .'5 1 -M per cent would be a

by Messrs Powers, ? '?litis! and PuKei
the latter of whom said, however, t'-.at
he felt the City Coum-il was ?i ti i t e
ca|>able of deciding upon the necessity
of a change in the city charter. '!?;
pointed out that the present form ol
government was proving satisfactory,
and sai?t that the engineering problem
connected with the Belt Line crossing
in the West 10ml h:i?! just been solved
by the Adimnistrar ive iioaid. Pre?l
dent Adams s substitute for the Nelsen
motion was lost on a tie vote. to
Colonel 'Jrundy moved to amend
providing that the charter commission
should be elected by the people from
the membership of the City ?'*otiu-.*il.
the amendment ing lest. 0 to 3.
In speaking t-> thii- proposed amcm'
mcnt. Ordway Puller said that he
doubted whether one ??f the Civic As

building of the city, and he believed,
if the association had prepared a char

that it would have been defeated ove:

that the people desire a change in the

that tin- only privilege 'he-City Council
would have with the proposed charter
change commission would be to pay its
expenses, to which Mr. (iunst retorted
that they should be paid and that all
connected with the municipal govern
liit-n should be paid
Mr. Puller 'wished to amend the
cliarter-eommission clause by providing
that no election should be held under
its terms until after the expiration of
live years from the preceding eb-? *ion,
declaring that the multiplicity of elec

the clause would )?<? a continuous per

castic, saying that it might be well
to hold election after election, as it
cost only between S-l,0i>(? and $3,000 to
have one, ami the city should have

Puller amendment was lost, il to :!, am!
