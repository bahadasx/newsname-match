HADING RESCUE
Lighthouse Tender's Propeller
is Fouled By Cable From Dis
tressed British Yeoman
At 3:15 this afternoon the Colum
bine, which wirelessed for help, was
reported to have lost the British Yeo
man, the lines having parted 15 miles
south of Nawiliwili. At that hour
both the nival tug Navajo and the
Coast Guard cutter Thetis were out
to render assistance. The Waialele,
which left here at 1:30 yesterday to
render aid, has not reported In. Pre
vious to having started to tow the
Yeoman, the Columbine cleared her
fouled propeller.
Late this afternoon the Inter-Island
Company received the report that the
Wailele had taken abetter at Nawili
wili. .
That he bark British Yeoman is
safe, but that in hauling her to safety
the lighthouse tender Columbine foul
ed a steel towing cable In her propel
ler, and has herself been placed In
danger, is the gist of advices received
by radio this morning by Alexander &
Baldwin from Port Allen. I
Rushing to the Columbine's assist
ance from Honolulu is the U. S. navy
tug Navajo, which lei? here at 8
o'clock this morning as If fiends were
after her, and bucked the seas at the
harbor bar until all that was visible
of her was her funnel, until she head
ed in the direction of Kauai.
This afternoon an Inquiry as to
whether the Wailele and the British
Yeoman had arrived here yet Was
received by the Star-Bulletin from
Lihue. This leads to, the belief that
the Wailele Is towing the bark to
this port The Inter-Island and Alex
ander & Baldwin both said this may
be possible, although the Wailele has
no instructions to bring her here, i
Before the Columbine was render
ed nearly helpless by her propeller
fouling, she was able to tow the Brit
ish Yeoman away from her threatening
position and moor her fast to moor
ing buoys placed by the government
Help In Nick of Time.
Help came to the British Yeoman in
the nick of time. Just before the Co
lumbine reached her the last of her
lines carried away, so that had there
been no assistance present the bark
would surely have; crashed on' the
rocks and been a total wreck. . ;
President J. A. Kennedy of the Intel-Island
said this morning the Wai
lele, which left here yesterday after
noon with wrecking gear to assist the
British Yeoman, will help the Colum
bine and keep her from drifting
ashore.
That the British Yeoman is leak
ing badly and much battered because
of the waves which have been pound
ing her, also that she has no anchors
left was stated in the radiograms re
ceived by Alexander & Baldwin today.
These said it is now believed possible
most of the schooner Prosper's cargo
of coal may be saved. The schooner
only had 200 tons on board when she
drove ashore, the rest having already
been discharged.

CzarnikowrRionda's Forecast
Shows Sugar in Strong Sta
tistical Condition '
Cuba's heavy 191516 sugar crop,
estimated at 580,000 "tons in excess of
last season's output, will not prove
an unwieldy market factor," but is, on
the contrary, apt to be insufficient
for the heavy demands that will be
made upon it by both Europe and the"
United States.
That Is the optimistic view of sugar
conditions taken by the. Czarnikow
Rionda Company of 112 Wall Street
New York, in their annual sugar re
view , and forecast received in Hono

Czarnikow-Rionda Com pan v think
that though temporary selling pres
sure during Cuba's months of heaviest
production may keep prices for a time
below the level justified: by actual
statistical co'Btions, values will
show a material 'rise during the last
half of the year. - r v
The company's annual market re
view follows: " -War

"The feature of overshadowing im
