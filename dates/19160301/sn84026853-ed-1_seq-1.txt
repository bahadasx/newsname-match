MR. STUCKEY TALKS
AS IF HE Will RUN
jIjshopville man consider.
ing entering race for
governor of s. c.
Colombia, S. C., Feb. 24.?Special:
That he will positively announce
within the next few days whether or
not he will be in the race for Gover
nor and opposing those planks in tne i
platform of Mr. Cole L. Blease which
advocate reduction of the passenger
rates on railroads to two cents and
reducing the rates of interest, was
stated to The News and Courier this
morning by Mr. W. A. Stuckey over
the long distance telephone from his
liome at Bishopville. At the same
time Mr. Stuckey emphatically and
positively denied the rumor that he
would run for Lieutenant Governor
on a ticket with Mr. Blease.
"Under no circumstances will I
taky second place on any man's ticket,"
said Mr. Stuckey, and added
that his announcement some months
ago that he would not run for Lieutenant
Governor stands. He declared
in unmistakable language that he will
not be the tail to any man's kite.
Rates and Interest.
Disagreement with two of the leading
planks in the platform of Mr.
Blease was expressed by Mr Stuckey.
He said he and the farmers favored
legitimate corporations and were opposed
to reducing the passenger rates
from two and one-half cents to two
cents per mile, and that they also opposed
reducing interest rates. "We
are in favor of constructive legislation
for the farmers," said Mr Stuckey.
Mr. Blease in his announcement for
Governor said he favored reducing
passenger rates to two cents and the
reduction of the legal rate of interest
to 6 per cent.
Mr. stucKey is not omy a prominent
leader in the Blease faction and
in the past supported and worked for
Cole L. Blease in his races for Governor
and United States Senator, but
he is also prominent in the new secret
Farmers' Union, which has gained
a strong hold in the Pee-Dee section
of the State. His statement this
morning that the farmers' mbvement
opposed the planks in the Blease platform
calling for reduced rates of interest
and reduced passenger rates
are considered highly significant in
political circles.
The Bishopville man has been mentioned
for Governor for some weeks,
and interest in what he will do will
he increased by his announcement
this morning that he has the matter
under advisement and will make a
definite announcement in the future.
He said over the long distance telephone
that if he ran for Governor it
would be on W. A. Stuckey's ticket,
and would not be an appeal to the
old factionalism. He will, he said,
advocate constructive legislation for
the farmers. The impression left on
the interviewer was that Mr. Stuckey
oorfain fr? mn for filovernor and
that he and the movement behind
him, the secret Farmers' Union, are
frowning on everv attempt to revive
the old factional lines.
Indicates Unrest.
The fact that such strong leaders
of the former Blease faction as Mr.
Stuckey, of Bishopville, and Mayor
Olin Sawyer, of Georgetown, are being
brqpght forward for Governor indicates
unrest and dissatisfaction
among the faction. It is an open secret
that several of the leaders feel
that they are deserving of consideration.
The positive announcement of former
Governor Blease that he is in the
race for Governor apparently settles
the question of what Solicitor R. A.
Cooper, of Laurens, will do. Those
who have watched the situation are
certain that Mr Cooper will now run
for Governor, and while he has consistently
declined to talk for publication,
it is felt here that he will now
announce. The interview of Mr.
Cooper last summer that he would
run for Governor "if certain condi
tions arise" was taken to mean that
if Mr. Blease entered for Governor
he would, too. The entrance of the
fromer Governor is now certain and
everyone believes that it is just as
certain that Solicitor Cooper will be
in the race. Announcement from
him is awaited with much interest.
Governor Manning will run for reelection,
and political circles in Columbia
would not be surprised at
other interesting developments.
One rumor here is that certain interests
in Washington are urging
Congressman J. F. Byrnes, of the 2nd
Congressional district, to run for
Governor. This report has gained
wide circulation and includes, among
other reports, that the South Carolina
delegation are nursing the Byrnes
boom.?W. F. Caldwell in News

the crowd.
McCorkle was captured soon after
an alleged attack on Mrs. A T Heath.

SIXTEEN INCH GUNS C
ON NEW WARSHIPS
j
AMERICAN NAVY TO MOUNT H
HUGE GUNS?MEANS LONGER ]
n A KTO *7
. R/V11UE..
Washington, Feb. 26.?Experimental
long range firing by the Atlantic
fleet and information about navaloi
battles in the European war virtually P<
have convinced the navy department dj
that battleships to be authorized this w
year should carry ten 16 inch guns 1'
each instead of the 12 14-inch wea- al
pons aboard ships of the Pennsylvan- m
ia and the California class now build- y<
ing. Details of gunnery are confi- b<
dential, but it became known to- ti
night that the next target practice of w
the fleet would be held at ranges up d<
to 18,000 yards because of the lessons
taught by the battle between I
German and British battle cruisers S
in the North Sea, where 17,000 yard a(
shots scored hits. |w
The navy general board recom- el
mended some time ago that new bat-,U1
tleships be signed for the 16-inch r<
rifles and proposed other military
characteristics that made it necessary
to increase the tonnage from ^
32,000 for the California class to G
36,000. Officials of the board haye
urged their views upon the naval P1
committtee in connection with the "
pending appropriation bill although P(
the 1917 building programme is not tc
yet before the committee. Many al
officers of high rank, however,. have c*
considered it unwise to mount the ?.
bigger guns or build the bigger ships. S1
Secretary Daniels, it is said, however, I
is about convinced of the desirability!
of the bigger ship project. |te
An order for the first kite balloon tr
to be added to the navy's aerial fleet in
has been placed, it was learned today, si
and this latest device to increase the in
accuracy of gunfire may be tested vi
during the spring target practice. It ri
is proposed that each battleship be ts
equipped with a captive kite balloon, b<
which will rise 1,000 feet above her tt
decks. The officers observing the T
fall of shots now stationed in the oi
fighting top? 150 feet above decks ai
will be stationed in the balloon bas-i
ket, communicating with the ship by tc
telephone. < iz
The navy's biggest guns now have in
a range of 12 sea miles or more, and' n<
this probably will be increased ma- vi
terially with the new 16-inch. Before
the committee recently Admiral vt
Winslow said he had seen weather tr
conditions in which ships were plainly in
visible at 30,000 yards, or 15 miles.
It probably was due, he said, to a r
mirage; but if he had had guns of tr
sufficient range he thought he could ei
have gauged his shots so as to make ai
a bombardment effective. a>

STORING THIS COTTON PAID." \Z
! ot
St. Matthews, Feb. 22?The Banks a<
& Wimberly Co., of this, place deliv- P"
ered to the Southern road here yes- ai
terday 3,100 bales of cotton from w
their warehouse. This cotton was!
stored in 1914 when cotton was sell-;?!
ing for six cents. For this lot they , ti
received 11.90 for 1,600 bales nad.it
11.50 for 1,500 bales. They still r?
have on hand 1,500 bales. pi
This is evidence of what storing in

;OMMIHEE AGREES
UPON MILITARY BILL
OUSE BODY DECIDES ON GEN
?KAL UKM5, IINCLUUIINU INCREASE
IN REGULAR ARMY
Washington, Feb. 26.?The house
ilitary committee agreed today up1
the general terms of a bill it exacts
to get before the house in ten
lys providing for a regular army
ith an authorized peace strength of
13,000 men; a federalized NationGuard
which would reach a fixed
inimum strength of 424,000 in four
;ars; adequate reserve systems for
)th of these forces, and organizaon
of civilian training camps with
ide discretion reposed in the war
apartment as to the terms of enstment,
training and government.
Members of both the house and
inate military committees frankly
Imitted today that they had doubts
hether a requisite force could be
ilisted in the National Guard, even
ider the proposed federal pay and
jgulation provisions, and a growing
indency to provide for a federal
*my reserve in addition to the regur
army and federalized National
uard was manifest in both commities.
Members said they favored a
ractical test of the possibility of
>rming a federal volunteer army in

i the continental army plan. The
aparent intention to abandon the
mtinental project wholly was one
F the causes leading up to the regnation
of Secretary Garrison.
The Senate Plan.
The senate committee has agreed
sntatively to a plan under which
aining camps would be authorized
i every congressional district where
ifficient men volunteered for trainig
under an obligation for war serce.
The maximum force to be thus
lised in any district would be a batilion
or substantially the same numjr
as proposed for the first year of
le Garrison continental army plan,
he camps would be under command
I full complements of regular
*my officers.
This tentative plan is in addition
> the regular army and the federated
National Guard proposals and is
tended to reach men who would
st be found in either of these serces.
Representative Kahn, who has ad)cated
an extension of the camp
aining to men who would not enlist
i the regulars or National Guard,
iid today that with 30,000 men aliady
enrolled for intensive military
aining this summer, without gov nment
aid, he had received assurlces
that fully 100,000 would be
mailable next year under his plan.
The house committee arrived at its
sgular army figures today as a comromise
after suggestions of a peace
rength of 220,000, 180,000 and
50,000 had been voted down by nar>wing
margins.
The Regular Army.
A non-partisan vote finally fixed
pon 137,000, or 2,000 , more than
scommended by the war department,
ith a provision designed to allow a
ircentage of overenlistment in or?r
to maintain that strength at all
mes. With this provision the total
rength authorized would be suffient
to provide .officers to carry out
ork of instructions , at schools,
nong militia regiments and for
* :-i J?A:? A U A
;ner special uuvies. v/ne muusauu
iditional men in the commissioned
?rsonnel was agreed upon as against
i increase of 786 proposed by the
ar department.
The increase over the department
?ures would be in field and coast arllery,
the former being doubled over
s present strength. A total of 12
igiments or 108 batteries is contemlatcd.
The coast artillery would be
icreased to a point where the regure
to man all mine and tomedo de
:nses and one-half the guns in fixed
>rtifications would be available with
i additional completement to man
le proposed mobile guns, to be
Ided.
The bill also provides that a Naonal
Guard officer from each organation
be detailed to attend the reg!ar
service schools, receiving the pay
I his rank in the regular army while
i such duty. It contemplates
ithorizing the president to draft the
aard into the federal service at any
me he deems best, without waiting
tecific authority of congress, ana
ould remove all restrictions on use
: the force outside the country.
May Add to Regulars.
Several members of the house comittee
are in sympathy with the sen;e
committee's proposals for the
igular army, which contemplate, as
intatively agreed upon, a complete
(organization and a peace strength
: 175,000 men. In the same way,
is said, members of the senate comittee
are willing to accept the judgent
of the house body on the
heme to federalize the National
uard.
The house committee will hear

BATTLE RAGING
AROUND VERDUN
BATTLE AROUND VERDUN HAS (
NOT TURNED IN FAVOR OF
EITHER SIDE IS REPORT.
The tide of battle around Verdur
has rAt turned in favor of
either side. While the Germans
claim fu^her advances, the French
"re enuallv emnhatic in their ?sser+;^n
that thev checked the attacks of
the masses of German infantry sent
ogniiist them.
Fort Dounumont has fallen to the
Germans, but it is reported to be in
T*uins. Around this position the most
desnerate fighting of the battle has
^een rroing on since Friday. Here
French counter-attacks were delivered
with such crushing force that
some nf the German detachments ,
were driven back, and one regiment
is almost encircled. To the west of
this fort, in a hand to hand encounter,
the French have ejected the Germans
from a small redoubt which
thev had captured.
The German ambassador at Washington
has officially informed Secretary
Lansing that the assurances
given in the Lusitania case with respect
to Submarine warfare have not
' been modified by the recent German
memorandum representing the Government's
intention to treat armed
i merchantmen as warships, beginning

NEW TELEPHONE CIRCUITS 1
FOR SOUTHERN RAILWAY
Washington, D. C., February 23.? {
In order that it may extend the use j
| of the telephone for dispatching j
trains over the entire line from Alex- j
j andria. Va., to Salisbury, N. C.f j
330 miles, Southern Railway has (
authorized the construction of 2 tele- (
phone circuits between Alexandria j
and Monroe, Va.? 160 miles. The
construction work will furnish em- j
ployment to a number of men and *
. will be under the direction of W. H. (
, Potter, Superintendent of Telegraph, |
[who will organize gangs to put up j
I the wires and install the station }
I A/iuinmonf Wnrlr will hponn AS
soon as forces can be organized and Ij
the necessary material secured. Be-1 j
tween Monroe and Salisbury the ?
Southern has used the telephone for j
dispatching trains for a number of ^
years and the results have been so
satisfactory as to justify an exten- {
sion of this system.
The telephone has several advanta- |
ges over the telegraph. Service is
quicker and it is easier to guard j
against errors. The dispatcher {
writes the order as he sends it, spell- ^
ing out all figures such as train numbers,
engine numbers, and time. The j
receiver writes the message as he receives
it and then repeats it to the
dispatcher, spelling out all figures.
The telephone brings the sender and 1
receiver into close touch and the t
dispatcher, should occasion arise, x
can talk personally to the conductor ^
or engineer of any train on his div- (
ision. * (
Thp line hetween Alexandria and f
Salisbury is a very important part of <
I the Washington-Atlanta line and
Southern Railway has provided every
facility for moving a heavy business
over it safely and expeditiously.
Double track is now being constructed
and automatic electric block
signals installed on all parts of it not
already so equipped. The addition
of the telephone dispatching system
will make this one of the most modernly
equipped railway lines in the
world.

IMPROVEMENTS ON
ASYLUM HELD UP
Columbia, Feb. 23.?Doubt as to
he legality of the item in the approbation,
bill of $100,000 for repairs
t the State Hospital for the Insane,
aused Comptroller Sawyer to refer .
he matter to Attorney General Peepas
for an opinion. The attorney
eneral says he does not think that
he appropriation of $100,000 for reiairs
at the asylum is appropriated
ecause the language of the bill is
oubtful. On this account the attorey
general advises that he cannot
ay that this appropriation is legal.
Because of this fact the comptrolsr
general will not pay out this
100,000 except on order from the
ourt, and it, therefore, seems that
omebody is to blame for another big
rror, all probably due to the rush
f ramming through matters in an
llnight session. It was intended
hat the approbation bill should cary
$100,000 for repairs at the aayam
and authority for the governor
5 borrow an additional $50,000 if
ecessary. However, the courts will
ave to pass on this matter before ;
he comptroller general will pay any
f it out.
just wnat tne enect 01 noiaing up
11 improvements at the asylum will
e remains to be seen.
There is a better half in every wedlg?but
