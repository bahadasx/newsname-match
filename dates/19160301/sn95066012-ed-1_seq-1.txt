PRESIDENT CALLS
FOR SHOW DO!
CONGRESS
Must Define Position Regarding
Americans on Armed Ships
DISSENSION HOLDS HIS HAND
Cannot Proceed with Submarine Ne
gotiations Unless His Policy Is
Supported.
Washington, March 1, President
Wilson decided yesterday that he can
not proceed with the German submar
ine negotiations while dissension in
Congress weakens his position before
the world, so he called for a show-down
on the pending proposals to warn
Americans off merchant ships of the
European belligerents armed for de
fense. Making clear that he considers the
president, and not Congress, charged
with the conduct of foreign relations
of the United States, he wrote a let
ter to Representative Edward W.'Pou
of North Carolina, acting chairman of
the House rules committee, asking
him. to provide parliamentary means
for bringing the agitation out into the
open on the floor of the House. Later
he summoned Senator Stone and Rep
resentative Flood, chairmen of the
foreign affairs committees, and Sena
tor Kern, majority leader In the Sen
ate, for a conference at the White
House thi3 morning, at which he will
request that one of the various pend
ing resolutions be acted on in both
houses. Divided counsels in Congress
said the president lu his letter, can
not fall to expose the country to tho
greatest risks. -

FOR BENNINGTON COUNTY
DEVELOPEAfiENT ANO
BETTERMENT
This Department Edited by Secretary
Willard W. Bartlett of tho County
Improvement Association
Vermont Hogs
The ideal farmer in Vermont will
raise hogs on a sufficiently large scale
and with similar methods to those in
the middle west. Primarily he will
raise them for the money they sell for,
but that Is not by any means their
greatest valuo If properly handled.
The following outline gives the
method whereby the hog keeps worn
out soil fully up to standard, often
times doubling the crop yield, - hence
when so handled we claim that for
this purpose the bog is worth more
than for pork.
The tillable farm should be cut up
into from three to five lots, as con
tour of the land may dictate, with hog
pen in center fenced with hog wire, so
that any ouo of the lots can be used
for pasturing.
The cheapest possible feed on which
to build a pig into a hog ready for fat
ting is grass, grain, soy beans, or peas
fed into the pasture. It's the natural
feed just as it is for cattle It is the
only possible method of getting ' the
largest profit for the least investment.
It's the universal method west where
so much pork is raised.
Rotation of crops is now recognized
as a wise policy, hence use one lot,
the one used for hay last year, for the
hog pasture this year, and you can
rest assured that when you plow this
hog lot the following spring it will
give a bumper crop of corn. The ad
joining lot should be put to corn for
fatting the hogs.
If Instead of the expense of picking
this corn you turn the hogs into it and
let them harvest it, that field will
raise at least one third more next sea
son. Here again the bog has done
more in fertilizing than you could
have done in any other way, and has
at the same time saved you the ex
pense of harvesting,
following this rotation year by year
getB the- hogs onto the land so mo part
of the season once In two years. Try
It and you will not be talking about
worn out Boil , ' ! . ;
But 6ay how shall I fat Uhem?
Can't, afford to buy much feed.
I Here Is how it has been 'dOno suc
cessfully here In Vermont and it's
the western method, also.. 1
When the kernels of corn are in ttse
milk commence to give a liberal teed
dally of stocks and all, cut close to
the ground and they will eat it up
very clean. This will start them on
wonderfully in growth.
Raise also some corn for late fat
ting and if necessary buy a little. By
raising sugar beets, pumpkins and
squash, peas, etc., the hog can be
made to weigh one hundred and fifty
pounds without buying much meal.
Farmers are more and more realiz
ing that pasture is necessary for tho
most economical production of pork.
Those who are raising hogs and put
ting them on the market with the
least post have their entire farms
fenced "hog-tight".
If possible have considerable clover
in the pasture. Fall sown wheat, oats
and rape sown early will make very
good pasture also. Writer has seed
ed down a three acre lot to timothy
with a liberal sowing of oats, and
when the oats were three Inches high
turned in seventy-five hogs and one
hundred and fifty, small pigs, all bar
ing rings in nose to prevent rooting.
Never got a better seeding than that
and the oats gave good green pasture
all summer.
Alfalfa is -unexcelled as pasture
where It can bo grown and the hay
makes good winter feed.
The root crops most used in tills
territory are potatoes and sugar beets.
Pumpkins are an excellent feed for
keeping hogs in a healthy condition.
Many farmers claim that the seeds of
pumpkins will prevent worms in pigs
and Bhoats and that a ration of pnm
kins fed with grain will keep hogs
thrifty and give them a good appetite.
A good many wagonloads can be
grown on an acre of rich land.
Stumpy land, or low moist land will
grow good pumpkins.
The health of tho hog is an import
ant consideration. ' Hogs that have
plenty of range and exercise are not
nearly so susceptible to disease as
those confined in a small pen. A hog
that goes out after his feed will be
well grown and thrifty, accustomed to
exposure, and not liable to he in
jured by a sudden change of weather.
It is diflicuult, however, to put a
good finish on hogs while running in a
large field or pasture. If they are al
lowed to run until three weeks or a
month before sending to market, and
are then shut up and given all the
corn they want, with plenty ot pure
water, they will make very rapid
gains.
In no other way can pork bo pro
duced more cheaply at the present
time in this country, or of better quali
ty. While the si raw of the pea crop
is lost for feeding by this system, it
j will render good service when plowed
unoer in supplying ir.e jnuu wuu vegei
able matter relatively rich In nitro
gen. Grind your corn, cob and all, and cook
in a large tank with the small pota
toes, pumpkins and nothing will fat
them faster. At the finish use more
meal.
A high market is a pleasing one
when selling pork, but tajte the mark
et up and down as it runs for ten
years and it averages fairly well pro
viding one is making the bog do
double duty by the rotary fertilizing
system. Thus Handled the Hog is a
' Veritable Gold Mine.
Bring oue the young pigs from a
good number of old bogs as early In
the spring as possible. Every week
gained in the spring is of utmost Value
in the fall as it Is advisable ' to get
early spring pigs fat and sell them
just as cold weather sets in.
The most profitable hog to sell
weighs about one hundred and fifty
pounds, beyond that tho upkeep of the
cue hundred and fifty weights is suf
ficient to kill profit on fatting. "By
this method one does not have to feed
to keep warm while fatting.. There Is
no profit from feed given for fatting
in cold weather unless the hogs are
unusually well boused and cared for.
Fo Vermont the very early pig sold at
approach of cold weather is best.
This gives you the hog during the
whole season of pasturing when you
need him on the land.
Here again as with apples Vermont
has a tremendous advantage over the
west in its nearness to the city mark
ets where fresh, light weight, but fat
porkers are always In demand. There
is also a splendid opening for home
cured hams that some one will some
day make a fortune from.
Whether It be hogs, horses, cattle,
poultry, or fruit trees, remember it
costs no more to raise the best varie
ty attainable than scrub, and the best
bring infinitely larger prices.

A NATIVE OF BENNINGTON
Mrs. Eunice Prendergast Died Feb. 20,
In Fredonia, N. Y.
The Washington's brthday issue of
the Grape Belt, dally newspaper,
of Dunkirk. N. Y., printed the followr
lng obituary notice about a former
resident of . Benhington," Mrs. Eunice
M. F. Prendergast. of Old Bennington:
Mrs. EiinSce Mario FnBsett Pren
dergast, widow of Thomas M. Pren
dergast of Westfleld died at the home
ot her son, 3eorge F. Prendergast, 342
Temple street, Fredonia, i Sunday
morniug, February 20th. at 5:40,
o'clock aged 97 years and 3 months.
Her health was good practically up to
the last, her death being due to old
age.
Mrs. Prendergast was probably the
oldest resident of Fredonia at the time
of her death and she was the last of
her generation of the well known
Prendergast family of Chautauqua
county.
She was the daughter of Henry
Hopkins Fassett and Clarissy Abell
Fassett and was born in Bennington.
Vt., on the farm where tho Benning
ton battle monument now stands. Up
to a short time before her death, she
often spoke of her old home in " Ver
mont and the stories . of the battle
handed down to her by her J parents.
The house was used in caring' for the
woundod and after the death : of her
parents and while she- was residing
in Westfleld, representatives of the
monument association made a trip out
here to complete the negdtlatlons- for
the purchase of the farm. The house
is still standing and there is a broil to
tablet in the sitting room, marking ft
as a place where the wounded r were
cared for.
She came to this country and joined
relatives at Westfleld in 1837, mak
ing the trip from Troy to Buffalo by
canal boat and from Buffalo west on
horse back. While in Westfleld, she
was married to Mr. Prendergast. Her
life was largely spent at Westfleld and
Barcelona. Four years ago she came
to Fredonia with her sou when he
purchased the home in Temple street
and had since resided there.
Besides the son, George F. Prender
gast, she is survived by four grand
children, George, Eunice and William
Prendergast of Fredonia and Charles
Harrington of Buffalo.

SHIPS IN ITALIAN
PORTS SEIZED
Government Requisitions 34 Cut
of 37 Steamers
VESSELS ARE WORTH MILLIONS
Kaiser's Submarine Commanders May
in the Future Destroy the Prop
erty of Their Fellow Citizens.
London, Feb. 29. It was announced
in the House of Commons today that
the Italian Government had requisi
tioned thirty-four of the thirty-seven
German steamers Interned in Italian
ports.
Recent reports from London said
that grave interest was being dis
played in England over the possibility
of a declaration of war on Germany
by Italy when the Italian Parliament
opened March 1.
The Italian Government, according
to dispatches received in London from
Rome, had not yet decided on Sunday
whether it would yield to the popular
demand for & war with Germany.
One of the leading explanations ad
vanced for Italy's action was that she
proposed to answer the new Germanic
submarine campaign which goes into
effect at midnight by sending German
owned ships to sea to meet the Teu
tonic submarines. Another explana
tion advanced was that Great Britain
short of ocean ships from submarine
activities, wanted to use the ships in
Italian ports and was urging Italy to
war on Germany.
