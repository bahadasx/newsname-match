The Advocate
"THE BATTLE CRY OF PEACE"
"The Battle Cry of Peace" deals
with the subject which is today
nearest the heart of every American
citizen tho problem of America's
unprcparcdness.
It portrays the defenseless con
dition of our country; tho conse
quences of which this condition
may lead; and tho way to avoid
these consequences.
The City of New York is at
tacked, by a powerful foreign foe.
You are an eye-witness. You see
the enemy approaching, tho power
Jessness of the city, the inadequacy
of its forts and defenses. You
see the havoo wrought by tho en
emy's cruisers, its submarines, its
airhips by its shells,
shrapnel,
bombs. You see the most beautiful
skyline in tho world in flames; the
metropolis of tho western hemis
phere devastated.
You see Now York fnll into tho
hands of the enemy; the desecration
thnt follows; j
. Then yon are shown the way
tluit such a calamity can be avoided
the one way. You are shown tho
way to peace for which America
so earnestly prays tho peace with
honor. "Tho Battle Cry of Peaco"
was writttn by J. Stuart Blackton
and Vitagraphed under his personal
supervision on a scale never bo
foro attempted in motion pictures.
This,, probably tho greatest of
all picture shows, and undoubtedly
the most important to tho American
people at the present time, wilL bo
screened at tho Tabb Theatre,
Wednesday and Thursday, March
1st and 2nd. Batineo 2:30; night
8:00.

LIFE COMES
T0ACL0SE
Mr. Harry Campbell Answers the
Final Summons at His Homo
Last Tuesday Night.
After many years of ill health
during which timo he always kept
in a happy frame of mind nnd boI
dom if ever complained of his ill
ness. Death came last Tuesday
night .shortly after ten o'clock, nnd
relieved Mr. Harry Campbell of his
sufferings.
Mr. Campbell was born and spent
his entire life in this city, no was
forty-six years old the day ho died.
He was a member of tho Episcopal
church.
Being of ft bright, sunny disposi
tion, with tho happy faculty of
jnaklng and retaining friends, "Bar
ney," as ho was familiarly called,
was one of tho most popular men
thnt ever lived in this city.
Poet nor artist has over been able
to portray tho grave in colors of
brightness nnd beauty. Bryant, in
tho "Hymn of Death," could not
make tho subject beautiful; and yef
the cemetery with its marblo and
its dead, tho chair that has no oc
cupant, the fancied echo of tho si
lent Voice, and the vacant plnco in
homo, social and lodge life, aro mel
lowing and uplifting in their influ
ence. They bring the best of human
naturo into tho fullness of vigor,
crowding back the selfishness and
imperiousness of men, ' and impress
ing them with tho duty of recogni
tion of the valuo of friendship. It
is the gloom of the church-yard
that reveals to us more clearly the
beauty of life. It is tho broken ties
at tho gravo that prompts us to a
fuller appreciation of the tender
ness of the tics that aro not yet
broken; and so while wo mourn the
!(!. of our dead we may rejoice
that there is no cloud so dark that
there is no light behind it, no sor
row so poignant that there is not a
balm for tho wound it inflicts.
Funeral services, wero conducted
by Rev. W. R. Dye nt tho Episcopal
church Thursday afternoon at two,
o'clock with burial in Mndhpelah
cemetery. Mr. Campbell is surviv
ed by two sisters, Mrs. Sophin Ran
dall and Miss Ollivo Campbell, one
niece, Miss Lucy Randall, all of
this city, and ono nephew, Mr. Win.
Rnndall, of Cincinnati, O.

tending sympathy.

men, Division Freight Agent of tho

es made in rates that were all out
of proportion to thoso received in
udjoining cities. Ho Vequcsicd'that
the Business Men's Club have a list
of tho commodities made showing

rate being received by Winchester
und other adjoining cities. He said

back to take up tho matter again,
as there aro few people who under
stand tho various freight schedules,
