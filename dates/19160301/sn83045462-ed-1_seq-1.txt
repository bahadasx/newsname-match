LONDON'. March i.?The
German offensive against Verdun,
which had brought the
crown prince's armies up to the
inner line of French defenses, has
halted there, according to today's
official statement from Paris.
The lull which yesterday gave
signs of setting in now extends
along virtually the entire front
where the desperate struggles of
the past week and more have been
going on. There were 110 important
developments at any point
during the night, the French war
office reports.
Await Next German Hove.
Unofficial commentators in entente
capitals admit themselves at a loss to
determine as yet whether the German
drive has spent its force or whether
the pause is simply the prelude to its
renewal before the hard-won positions
at Verdun or elsewhere on the front.
Possibly significant in this connection
is the French official statement
that there are signs of German preparation
behind the front west of Ponta-Mousson,
-eighteen miles southwest
of Metz and in the Moselle river region.
The French guns have been!
pounding the second and third line j
\jr*r? ui/iii puDiuons mere, wime ail
mittent bombardment has been going:
on at various points between RegnieTille
and Remenauville. some half dozen
miles west of Pont-a-Mousson.
Look for Southern Drive.
Apparently the recent German attack
!n the Champagne was nothing more
than one of the numerous local opera- j
tions such as the Germans carried out I
in several sectors of the front from j
time to time in the three weeks preceding
the Verdun offensive as it has :
not so far been followed up. It is the '
opinion of military observers that the
German offensive, if it broadened appreciably,
would be more likely to
spread to the south than the north, the
many signs of activity along the lines
in upper Alsace and down to the Swiss
border being pointed to in this connection.
Paris dispatches declare the situation
north of Verdun satisfactory to the
French, who have strongly fortified
their positions from Cote du Poivre,
four miles due north, to Douaumont,
three miles to the east, along which
line the German pressure above Verdun
has been heaviest. At Douaumont itself
several hundred Germans are reported
still cut off in the fort, which
the French have surrounded.
Quiet on Verdun Front.
PARIS. March 1, 2:30 p.m.?There is
nothing of importance to report in the
rejrion to the nr.rth r?f in
the Woevre district, according to the
announcement of the progress of hostilities
made by the French war office
this afternoon.
There was an intermittent bombardment
last night along the French front
between Regnieville and Remenauville.
The text of the communication issued
by the war office follows:
"In the region to the north of Verdun,
as well as in the Woevre. there has
been nothing of importance to report.
"During last night there was an intermittent
bombardment at various
points of our front between Regnieville
and Remenauville.
"To the west of Pont-a-Mousson our
artillery fire was directed against the
second and third of the enemy lines,
w here the Germans apparently were
putting through certain preparatory
evolutions.
"In Alsace the Are of our batteries
had been directed against the roads
of communication of the enemy.
"In the region of Ornay, valley of
the Thur. a French aeroplane equipped
with double motors was successful In
an encounter with an aeroplane of
the enemy. The German machine fell
at I-a Bassee. into the German trenches,
and at once caught on lire."
No Mention of Verdun.
BERLIN. March 1. via 1-ondon. 3:15
pin.?No mention of the fighting at
Verdun is made in the official statement
of today. The report follows:
Activity of the artillery yesterday
was very great on various parts of the
front, a..v I ~-Gcularly on the enemy's
side. At various point.? the enemy fired

On the other hand. In the
Yser region. in the Champagne and between

Gompers to Be Speaker.
Samuel (lompers, president of tlie
federation, will be the principal
J speaker, and those in charge hope that
j government employes in Washington
I will crowd the hall. The meeting will
be called to order by Edward Tucker,
president of the Central Labor Union of
Washington, and labor leaders from
out of town communities will be here.
One of the speakers will be President
Ferguson of the Maryland State and
District of Columbia Federation of
Labor. Frank Morrison, secretary of
the American Federation, will speak,
and an address will be delivered by
Thomas F. Flaherty, secretary and
treasurer of the National Federation of !
Post Office Clerks. I
Considerable attention will be paid
during the mass meeting to inducing
the government employes to join the
unions and affiliate with organized
labor. They have been doing so in/
large numbers the past few days, but
today a "scare" story of some kind got
j around town that they are not allowed
j to affiliate with organized labor, which
is officially denied at the federation
headquarters.
Have Bight to Join Union.
It was said that the so-called LioydLa
Follette provisions of the post office
appropriation bill of the Sixty-secOtVd
Congress specifically allow government
employes to join labor unions,
and it is also pointed out at labor
headquarters that their right to do so
is proven by the existence of the National
Federation of Post Office Clerks
and the existence in JSan Francisco of
the Association of Civil Service Krn|
ployes. which is affiliated directly with
the American Federation of l^abor.
The meeting will be held under the
auspices of the Central Labor Union,
of which the Stenographers. Typewriters.
Bookkeepers and Assistants'
Union is a part. A committee of the
Central Labor Union, headed by Henry
Xolda. is making arrangements for ihe
meeting.
Takes Issue With Mr. Borland.
A government clerk who desires to
preserve his anonymity, but who has a
close knowledge of conditions affecting
stenographers and typewriters in the
government service, in an interview today
took issue with statements that
have been made by Mr. Borland to the
effect that government employes receive
more pay for similar work than employes
of private concerns. He said
the statement is a mistake, so far as
stenographers and typists are concerned.
When I passed the civil service exJ
animation, about five years ago. in
Buffalo. N. Y." he said, "the impression
was general among stenographers in
that city that the civil service examinations
were decidedly 'stiff,' and that
only about one-third of those who tried
succeeded in passing them. A short
time after 1 came to Washington I
looked into this matter, as set forth in
a report of the civil service commission.
and, if my memory is correct, only
about 35 per cent of those who tried
succeeded in passing the stenographer
and typewriter examination.
"Outside of Washington the idea also
is prevalent that government jobs pay
well and offer assurance of reasonably
rapid promotion. This idea induces, in
my opinion, the best stenographers in
the country to try the examinations. It
follows, then, that if only 35 per cent
of these pass, the government is getting
the 'cream' of the stenographher
j and typist talent of the United States.
| Wide Gulf Between Classes.
"There is a wide gulf between the stej
nographer engaged In the usual kind of
commercial work and the government stenographer.
"Fresh from high school or business
?college, without experience, a setnogJ
rapher can easily get a salary of $50 a
i month in commercial work. The civil
service commission specifically stated
when I tried the examination that such
stenographers were not desired. The entrance
salary of $900 is, it seems, what
the government is willing to pay for experience,
a difference Jbt $300 a year. An
employer knows that experience is worth
the money. However, though the civil
S service commission advertised in bulletins
that the entrance salary was $900, yet
when I received notice that I had passed
the examination I also received a blank
form requesting me to name the lowest
salary I would accept.
"There is no doubt that some government
clerks will resign if the eight-hour
measure passes, and these will be mostlv
young, unmarried men. The married men
and the government-acclimated men could

A movement undertaken last
November in the strictest secrecy
has resulted in the organization
of the "employes of the two street
railway companies of Washington
into Division No. (>8o of the
Amalgamated Association of
Street and Klectric Railway I .titployes,
organized in i8yj. audi
affiliated with the American Fed- j
eration of Labor.
Committees ?>f the new association
today waited on officials of the Capital
Traction Company and the Washington
Hallway and Klectric Company to
submit a memorandum of agreement
for their consideration, the principal
points in which relate to the questions
of hours of labor and of remuneration.
In both these respects, and in other
minor matters, committee members at
the headquarters of the Federation of
Labor in the Ouray building stated this
afternoon local conditions were characterized
as harassing, if not intolerable,
era ble.
The organization has been completed
since January 3. and according to
claims of the organization, embraces
approximately two-thirds of the more
than 1,500* motormen and conductors
of the two companies Its charter was
issued by the pa ..nt organization,
which has some 00,000 members in 350
cities of the l.'nited States and Canada.
January 10. The first steps in forming
it were taken by L. A. Sterne and
Kd. Toone, volunteer organizers of the
Federation of Labor. Later W. D. Mahone.
international president of the
parent organization, came to Washington
to push it forward and the
worn was completed by tieztn Orr, international
treasurer, who is now in
the city and who is co-operating with
the new branch.
Demand Kegarding Workday.
In the agreement submitted one of
the principal points is that a day's
work for all regular men shall be nine
to ten hours' duty, and that this shall
be completed within twelve consecutive
hours. Now, state the committeemen.
the hours of labor run nearer
twelve and thirteen, and are so divided
and strung out that often eighteen
hours are needed to complete a tenhour
tour of duty. This point is to insure
an employe sufficient consecutive
rest, now said to be impossible. No regular
man shall be required to perform
extra duty when an extra man is available.
it is further demanded, and
where regular men are called to report
for extra duty and, for any cause
not their own. do not go out, they shall
be paid from the time they report until
relieved at their regular rate of
wages.
The employes contend that at present
they sometimes must report and wait for
a considerable period, only to find that
they are not needed, and for this they
do not get a cent.
Another feature is that the wages of all
motormen and conductors shall be 30
cents an hour. At the present time the
Capital Traction Company pays 22
cents an hour regardless of the length
of employment. The Washington flail- (
way and Klectric pays 21cents for the
first year. 22 'j cents after that. 23 '2 1
cents after five years' work and 25 cents .
after ten years. A few years ago its
maximum was 22's cents. ]
"The purpose of this agreement is to
provide the best and most satisfactory 1
service to the public, to provide the
best possible workinsr conditions for '
the men, at the same time having due
regard to the economical operation of
the company's cars," runs the document
which was submitted in duplicate to j
.1 H. Hanna, general manager of the
Capital Traction Company, and J. T. <
Aloffett, assistant, superintendent of .
transportation of the Washington Railway
and Electric Company.
"It is hereby agreed that the properly
accredited officers of the company
shall meet and treat with the properly
accredited officers of the association on
all questions and grievances, and
should there he any that cannot be
amicably adjusted the same shall be
submitted to a temporary board of arbitration."
Would Protect Employes.
A further section specifies that the
company shall agree that any employe
who, upon investigation, is found to
have been discharged or suspended unjustly
shall be reinstated and reimbursed
for all time <
Another is that the company shall)
agree that officers of the sew associa- ]
tion shall be granted leave of absence ' i
on organization business when so re- ]
quested, and that any officer whose duties
entail his absence from his work ,
shall, on his retirement from office, be
replaced in his former position. <
Still another section is to the effect
that the company agrees that each motor
passenger car shall be in control of
a motorman and conductor, who shall
have had at least ten days' instruction
under an experienced man in the service
of the company for at least a year

Concern Expressed at Commercial
Congress Over Activity of
United States.
* LOXDON, March 1.?That important
L~ua.ii?ca mc uiipciiuiii^ in i.ne government's
fiscal and commercial policy is
the deduction the London morning papers
draw from Chancellor McKenna'a
speech at the commercial congress
yesterday.
The Standard remarks that the position
of most of the members of parliament
relative to free trade and kindred
questions has been altered and
broadened by the lessons of the war.
War on German Trade.
"The whole atmosphere of the house
af commons," says the .Standard, "is
slowly changing. Tariffs, subsidies and
preferential duties are no longer
shunned by the liberty party. Jt is expected
that Mr. McKenna, before presenting
the budget, will give parliament
some concrete examples of the
ipplication of his new policy for the
development of ^foreign trade. He has
counseled with experts and has a
sound, well defined plan. Moreover, he
does not intend to wait for the end of
the war before putting into effect
policies intended to assure that Gernanv
shall never rearain her lost mar
kets.
"A wall against German oversea trade
will be built while the military issues
of the war are still being fought. The
government intends that instead of
Jermany being able to flood the world s
markets after the war she shall And
no markets to flood. Mr. McKenna's
policy will be a policy.of anticipation
and development."
For Change of Policy.
At yesterday's session of the commercial
congress, which was attended
loy representatives of all the great
commercial organizations of the country
forming the British Association of
Chambers of Commerce, several important
resolutions were adopted after
in extended debate, two of them relectlng
overwhelmingly the sentiment
for an entire readjustment of the
British economic and trade policy.
The government's interest in the
Meeting was shown by the attendance
>f the chancellor of the exchequer,
Reginald McKenna, who has charge of
he framing of the tariff schedules,
ie addressed the executive committee,
i?r>1arinr that the eroverninent whh not
committed to adhering: to the old ecolomlc
policies, which the experience of
he war had shown must be readjusted

American Competition Feared.
The commercial congress resumed
its session today and adopted a number
of important resolutions on (Tanking
and shipping.
American activities in both these .
fields were urged as one of the zzilr.
IT OF PRELIMINARY PRAC
factors which necessitate energetic ,
British action. '
The banking resolution first introduced
was somewhat critical of the |
banks, but Sir Edward Holden, who recently
visited the United States with
Lord Heading's commission, turned the
tide in a stirring speech favorable to
the banks. He declared the banks were
providing- resources to carry on the
j war and at the same time finance Brit;
is'n industries and also maintain a huge
reserve for the national safety.
Sir Edward warned commercial men '
to prepare to aaaist^ln spreading BVitish
banking abd industry to Russia and
South America and take advantage of
the opportunities now opening. A vast
organization, he said, recently had been
established in the United States, with
a capital of $50,000,000, designed to
carry American trade throughout the
world.
Banks for South America. !
"We must do the same thing." he declared,
"and do it quickly. We should
have a system of British banks
; throughout South America, particularly
I in the Argentine and Brazil, and ]
throughout Russia and other allied
countries. Our government should
wake up and take a governmental interest
in this question."
Delegate A. L. Hobson of Sheffield
said the American organization was
I founded to get control of Argentine
irade arid had extended beyond that.
He urged prompt steps by the British
to meet American efforts to secure
South American trade.
The main discussion, however, was
for a British organization which would
overcome German foreign competition, s
The resolution finally adopted declares: <

framed plans to bring them out first or

d is the proper description of the
ulting from President Wilson's denate
on the administration's (ierman
'
prospect by the conference at the
leaders. They came back to the
when they went, according to their
that the President wanted a vote

step seemed to be in sight, and that
House committee on foreign affairs

i Mr. Pou.
iftairs was called in special session
deii of what is regarded as the most
-onted any foreign affairs committee
being: made to decide on the form of
action Congress should take.
e
Form Not Determined.
n
g The conference agreed that in deference
to the wishes of President Wilson
a (a vote would /be taken in the near fuiture
in both Senate and House on resolutions

g the armed ships, but the form in which
the resolutions will l>e presented will
0 be determined later.
Immediately after t lie conference
c Chairman Flood went to the Capitol
and called his committee together to
s frame a resolution.
The President made it clear that ha
A did not want a vote on a resolution ex
pressing support of his conduct of the
" diplomatic controversy, and ,as a reg
suit of his position the vote will be
s taken on a resolution warning Amere
leans off armed ships. Administration
" forces are sure they can beat it.
The President also discussed the question
with Acting Chairman Pou of the
j rules committee. The President asked
j that as soon as the House foreign affairs
committee had prepared its resoc
lution the rules committee bring in a
1 rule for discussion and a vote on the
r floor.
1 At the conclusion of the conference
the leaders hurried back to the Capitol.
a It was almost certain that the Parlia
mentary situation in both houses would
s prevent a vote coming up today.
e Special Bule Necessary.
5 The President explained to the lead5
ers that lie had written to the rulea
i committee, not because he was dissat!
isfled with any action of the foreign af.
fairs committee. but because he
- thought it expedient, as he realised
that a special rule would be necessary
, to provide for immediate consideration.
; Chairman Flood after some conference
at the Capitol said that after he
had drafted a resolution he would confer
with the President on its exact
form before it was presented to the
House.
Speaker Clark and Majority Lesder
itehin said no action could be taken
today in the House and that the conference
had been devoted chiefly to diet
cussing procedure.
j "The habit of obedience has been
developed to a high degree in ?'on1
gress," was Mr. Kitchin's answer to a
question about prospects of a vote. He
, is one of those who have favored the
resolutions. One plan discussed was
' for the House foreign affairs committee
: to report adversely one of the pending
resolutions .and at the same time have
the rules committee bring in a rule
limiting' debate. By that plan a v?te
i could be reached in the House tomor*
. row or Friday, and the question would
, be taken up in the Senate immediately
afterward.
Situation No More Serious.
The President told the leaders the
foreign situation was no more serious
todav than it has been for sev^rjil
j weeks, but he believed action should be
I taken quickly to show the world that
jthe American government was not dij
vided. '
I Some of the conferees thought the
best procedure was for the Senate and
House to adopt a resolution supporting
the President's position, but Air. Wilson
vetoed that plan and expressed a
desire to have the vote on a resolution
warning Americans off armed ships, because
he was confident that it would bo I
defeated.
Leader Kitchin said he did not think
the AlcLemore resolution would he the
one offered by the foreign affairs committee
and Chairman Flood said it
his opinion that none of the resoiu*
