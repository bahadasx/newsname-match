MANY PRISONERS BEING TAKEN
London, Feb. 27. Tho great bat
tle centering around Verdun, In
which a half million men aro en
gaged, Is still being fought at nomo
points with tho same fury as char
acterized It several days ago.
Champneuvlllc, to tho west, and
tho fortified works of Hardaumont,
to tho chst of Fort Douaumont, have
been captured by tho. Germans. Ber
lin also claims to havo captured the
Cote do Talou, to the west of Douau
mont, but, according to the French
official statement, tho artillery lire
coming from both sides has render
ed this position untenable for either
French or Germans.
Tho French are hurling attack
after attack upon the Douaumont
positions held by tho Germans, who
are declared to bo maintaining them
selves thore with difficulty, hut In
the Woevre region, to the east of
Verdun, the French" advanced posts
have been withdrawn.
Large re-enforcements are being
brought up probably by both force3,
and It Is reported that the British
lines are being extended In Belgium
and France In order that French
troop3 may bo released for the Ver
dun battle.
In the Vosges mountains tho Ger
mans also started a heavy offensive
southeast oftCelles, but It was com
pletely checked by tho French. On
the other extreme end of tho line,
around Ypres, a British attack was
repulsed by tho Germans.
Between Solssons and Rheims a
vigorous bombardment has been car
ried out against the German posi
tions. There has been considerable activ
ity along the Russian front around
J Riga, Frledrlchsladt and Illoukst. In
tho Caucasus region, despite the
heavy snow, which at places Is breast
deep, tho Russians are continuing
vigorously their pursuit of the

THE WAY SOME SHERIFFS.
WORK STATE FOR CLAIMS
The Lexington Leader says:
There has been a new graft un
covered .by tho Attorney General's
one? in lis probe of the accounts ot
various ewaty officers and especial
ly the traveling expenses of sheriffs
and 'their deputies.
1 It Is very simple. A man Is employ
ed at $3 per day to go and get. some
prisoner. He Is .gone tea days. That i
would seem to ladicate that his pay
would be $30. But to a bill figured
not long ago, and seat la to the State
for payment, tho bill asked for wa3
figured like this: Ten days of 24
hours makes' 240 hours. A working
day is eight hours; 240 divided by
eight hours makes thirty days, at
throo dollars a day, or $90.
Equally interesting is the account
of a sheriff coming homo with a pris
oner, who reached town at nightfall,
stopped with his prisoner in a house
Just outside of town. Ho came in with
him next morning, charging for an
additional day's salary nnd expense.
When explanation was asked, ho said
it was dono to save tho prisoner hu
miliation, as many of his friends
were In town that night.

papsr man describes as follow -i
day's experience on tho western

"A head ventures above a parapet

the men at work drop their picks

Tho Owensboro Inquirer of Sun

Tony F. Fosko, of Central City,
violinist nnd composer of many soul
ful melodies, sits in the bull-pen at
the Daviess county jail and cogitates
upon the startling fact that he has
only Just discovered that he haso.io
too many wives. His violin, an In
strument blackened by age, deco
rates the desk of police lr adquarters
and Tony cinnot sooth" his troubled
60Ul wlth tho honeyed and mellow
toIle3 iro ll's trusty fiddle.
Tony is a bigamist. Ilo admits it
but claims that he Is the violin of
cruel circumstances. He lias ono
wife in Owensboro and another, and
a newer one, in Central City. Judge
Slack will have to straighten the
matter out.
Tho warrant for Fosko's arrest
wa3 sworn out by Mrs. Mary Hunter
Fosko, living on Hathaway street In
this city. She allcge3 that Foako
married her In Central City on Sep
tember 29, 1910, and Fosko says
she's right. In 1914 at Metropolis,
111., Mls3 Rosa Smith hecime Mrs.
n03ko tlis second, nnd sho is now in
Central City, caring for twins born
to the second union.
Tosko was fiist taken by the po
lice on the charges of drunkenness
and disorderly conduct. He appear

Hathaway street, and according to
the story of Mrs. Fosko the first,
started to take possession of the
premises in ways and by means that
indicated ho was very, very angry

Then the Owensboro wife got busy
and swore out the wairant charging
Bigamy.
"Oh, I married both ot them all
right," said Fosko Saturday after
noon as .Jic stood in tho jail corridor.
'But I didn't mean to bo a bigamist.
I wasn't broi'rht up that way and I
know better," lie declared.
"I'll tell jou how it was. I mar-,
ried Mary Hunter in Central City
and wo lived thero for awhile. Then
rhhe "beat it" with another man. Sho!

that night asked mo what my name

told mo about Mary Hunter llvln'

that she wasn't dead. So I went out
there to seo if sho was tho right one.
I told her I .just wanted to talk to
