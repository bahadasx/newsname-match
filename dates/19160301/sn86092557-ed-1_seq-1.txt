The President told the leaders the
foreign situation was no more serious
today than it hail lioen for several
weeks, but he believed action should
>b taken quickly to show the world
the American government Is not dlvld
ed.
Some of the conferees thought the
best procectlure was for the Senate
and House to adopt a resolution sup
porting the President's position but
Mr. Wilson vetoed that plan and ex
pressed a desire to have a vote on
the resolution warning Americans off
armed ships, because he was confident
that It would be defeated.
It was understood that some of tbe
leaders who conferred at the White
House today still differed with the
President's position. Speaker Clark
who predicted last week that the warn
ing resolution would pass 2 to 1 at
that time, said he did not know the
sentiment of tbe House now and re
fused to say how he himself would
vote.
Germany's latest assurances on the
conduct of submarine warfare present
ed Monday by Count von Bernstorlt to
Secretary Lanslns are not so broad
is the United States desires, but It is
indicated no further steps will be tak
en by this government until the admin
Istration Is certain Its action will not
ie embarrassed in Congress.
The assurance reiterated In the last
communication are regarded as not
so complete as those originally given
as the result of the LusitanLa negotia
tions and It was indicated today tbat
the pending Lusitanla agreement
would not be Anally accepted as sat
isfactory at this time.

TO OPERATORS
(By Associated Press)
NEW YORK, March 1.?When the
soft, coal miners resumed their con
ference with operators from the mid
dle west here today to negotiate a new
working contract they were prepared
to fight for the amended wage demand

ing an agreement, they say because
the advance demanded Is not justified
by business conditions in the soft

clare they will not concede anything
more and would rather fight out the
battle in separate state conferences
than take less than rate submitted
yesterday.
The amended demand scaled down
the increase from 10 per cent, to six
per cent, net on tho mine ruh basis.
The present rates and the new prices
demanded are as follows:
Machine mining?Western Pennsyl

cents; new rate asked, 60 cents; Ohio
