that, because the till-important ap

had hern delayed in transit, the State
Department thus far was unable to
determino whether the claims set for

Meanwhile, if any American citizen
! is injured during the attack by a
j submarine on a merchant ship which
jd*>es not and has no Intention of using
its armament otherwis> than defen
sively, a grave situation will arise.
The United States Hands at this
time., as it always has 'lone, for the
riphts of American citizens to travel
with safety on defensively armed ships.
If the. German contentions are sus
tained. however, and it is proved con
clusively that a ship upon which an
American may be injured used defen
sive armament for purposes of offense,
it is considered unlikely that this gov
ernment. will take any action.

Ten torpedo-boats and oilier craft
are soourtnn flu: vicinity of tlie scene

Not a word is forthcoming from the
Ministry of Marine as to how [.a
Provence met her fate tt is generally
accepted as a fact, however, that she
was sent to the bottom b> a torpedo,
as (lei man and Austrian submarine*
have been operating recently in the
Mediterranean waters. Before she
could summon aid she had been tor
pedoed. ami immediately began to sink.
At the tune of the attack she was in
ihe middle of the .Mediterranean, mid
way between Malta and Melos, which
are about r.oo miles apart.
The signals of distress sent out ilid
not hrinK' aid until after th?* former
liner had been sunk It is evident that
1 .a Provence was carrying troops either
from or to Salonikl.
The troops and members of the crew
had taken to the boats, and, as rapidly
us tliey were (ticked up. they were
hurried to Melos or Malta The first of
Hie survivors reached Melos on Sunday
morning.
AnnouucerHcnl of the disaster was
withheld in the hope that all ? tf those
un board would be picked up. This
hope final I.\ bad to be abandoned, how
river, by olliciails.

The President's letter to Mr. Pou, tj>et
signal that the administration was
ready to Rive Germany a demonstration
of unity, follows:
"My Dear Mr. Pou,?Inasmuch as I
learn that Mr. Henry, chairman of the
Committee on Rules, is absent in Tox^3,
I take the liberty of calling your at
tention. as ranking member of the
commiitee, to a matter of grave con-\'
corn to the country, which can. I be
lieve, be handled, under the rule's of
the House, only by that committee.
"The report that, there are divided
counsels in Congress in regard to the
foreign policy of the government is
being made Industrious use of in for
eign capitals. 1 believe that report to.
be false, but so long as it is anywhere
credited, it cannot fail to do the
greates' narm and expose the country
to the most serious risks. . J.thenjfujfl
feel justified in asking that your com
nritteo will permit me to urge an early,
vote upon the resolutions with regard
to travel on armed merchantman
which have, recently been so much
talked about. In order that there may
be afforded an immediate opportunity
for full public discussion and action
upon (hem. and that all doubts and
conjectures may be swept away and
our foreign relations once moro cleared
of damaging misunderstandings.
"The matter is of so grave import
ance and lies so clearly within the field
of executive initiative that I venture
the hope that your committee will not
think that I am taking unwarranted
liberty in making this suggestion as
to the business of the House, and I very'
earnestly commend it to their imme
diate consideration.
"Cordially and sincerely yours,
"WOODROW WILSOK."

AKTEIl CAHIXET MEETING
This course was decided on after to
day's Cabinet meeting, at which it
was discussed, and after a. week's quiet
steady work at the Capitol. Prompt
action is desired, particularly in tho
House, where agitation has been mos
turbulent, and where Speaker Clarl
predicted antiadministration resol
lions. when tirst introduced, would have
passed by a majority of two to on<^
There never has been a question of
(lie administration control on the Sen
ate side.
Adoption of the pending resolutions
practically would amount to congres
sional repudiation of policies announced
and contended for by President Wil
son and Secretary {.aiming all through
the submarine negotiations, which mor<*
than once were in a crisis. With their
defeat and an atllrmation by a ma
jority of Congress of their eonfldence
sit the President's course, Mr. Wilson'*'
supporters point out, he will bi
enabled to continue t<? contond for tjhfi
principles of international law ?TJr|
humanity with a united government*
behind him. and with the same forvij
as ho .' Wore a minority in Co^la
gross v Hdhia position more th$|j
