(By Associated Press.)
LONDON, Mar. 1. Today marked the opening of Hie new
German submarine campaign. The Britisher Thomby Ik reported
as sunk mid the crew killed or drowned.
Hrltlxh censorship prevents transmission of details. Reference
to the crew being killed or drowned Indicates that she was sunk
by a mine or a torpedo. The German Hnd Austrian decrees regard-
Ing the winking of armed merchantmen went into effect at mid-'
night. There are no indication as to whether the Thornaby was

RESCUE EULA SHOWING'
GOOD WIDl HAND WORTH
Rescue Eula is still climbing
and there U intense Interest
taken in the stock. Shares are
advancing in value and there is
eagerness for acquisition. The
official in charge of the property
in the absence of the superinten-
dent naturally does not feel at
liberty to give out any detailed
information that might, after
further developments proceed,
prove to be incorrect and cause
investors to suffer loss.
All that can be definitely learn-
ed from anything like an authen-
tic source is that "the width of
the vein Is good and that the
values are commercial." This is
an assurance that the mid is a
bona fide one, but as the Ilnnanza
stated yesterday, the people con-
nected with the company must
first assure themselves of the
permanency of the find before
anything ran be given out that
will not be subjected to the pos-
atblllty of disproval later. "
Street rumor has It that the
vein ia on the atrikt and of the
same quality as the Occidental
of the Belmont. This disproves
wild statements that it averagea
$50 a ton. The Occidental in the
Belmont is a very uniform ledge
in width and values, carrying
about $20. which is considerably
higher than the average mill
heads of the district, if the
new find runs that well, with its
reported width of four to five
feet, it is Indeed a good dlscov-
ery, being to the eastward of
the Belmont.
. At all events work was done
yesterday repairing the bins and
the Bonanza ia Informed by peo-
pie who went out to the property
that ten mine cars of ore were
dumped Into the bins this morn-
Ine
Naturally the Rescue manage-
ment will continue the crosscut
a short distance farther In order
to determine whether or not it
was a false wall that was en-
countered after passing through
the ledge. This, however, la only
a continuance of the street ru-
4 inor, as well as the inference
that the next step will be drift-
ing both ways on the. vein.

Germans are reported as still remaining in the fort which the

Through the generosity of the Wo

has been authorized to order new ap
paratus for the school playground.
The pieces authorized at present are
a patent athletic slide with ladder, 6
feet ( inches high anJTslldlng board
12 feet 3 inches long, and a patent
bump-the-bumps with ladder 8 feet
high and sliding board 15 feet 6
Inches long. These have been order-
ed from U..S. Tothill, the Chicago
manufacturer of high grade play
ground equipment. The smaller of
these slides will be placed on the
southeast end of the school building
for the use of the small children,
while the larger will be placed at the
opposite end for fhe larger pupils.
These pieces are on all public play
grounds, are the most popular pieces
of apparatus and the Tonopah child
ren are very fortunate to be able to
have such sport as the slides provide.
The Woman's club has appropriated
a hundred dollars tor these slides
and by the time the apparatus is In
place the club expects to have an
equal amount for the purchase of hori
zontal ladders and other apparatus
that can be used by large numbers of
pupils. The club will also repair the
apparatus already set up at the school
house and one the play ground near
Florence avenue. Other equipment
will be added from time to time until
Tonopah has play grounds second to
none in the state. ,
