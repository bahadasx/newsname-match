not only held his audiences, but con

person, an,d many a parent away with
higher ideals, purposes, and resolves
for life, as well as many practical
hints for daily use.
"Dr. Joy's course of lectures were

unabated interest, when he spoke
on The Bov* Problem as We Face

by himself, in a way calculated to
promise better understanding, smv
