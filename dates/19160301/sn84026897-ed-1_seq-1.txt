JOHNSTON LETTER.
D. A. R. Observe Washington's
Birthday. Baptists Call Pas
tor. Reciprocity Day
^ Celebrated.
February 22, George Washing
ton's birthday was observed here by
all the public places being closed,and
at the high school honor waa given
to the memory of the Father- of his
country. It seems that Providence
left him childless that his country
might call him Father.
The Emily Geiger chapter cele
brated Washington's birthday by
an old Virginia bot supper, this
pleasant affair being . held io the
home of Mr. and Mrs. James White.
The interior had a most patriotic
air with decorations of red, white
and blue, many flags, cannon and
drums were about.. The liberty bell
occupied a conspicuous place. As
the guests arrived a pompous old
servant of by gone days, swung
?f open the door and bowed low and
several colonial dames greeted yon.
Those in costume were Mesdames
James White, M. T. Turner, J. L.
Walker, W. S. Mobley, W. F.
Scott, E. R. Mobley, and Misses
Loise Boyd and Zena Payne. Bright
and patriotic music 'formed an en
joyable program and later a silhou
ette contest was held. Partners were
gotten, silhouettes drawn and cut
out and then when pinned over a
large black curtain made excellent
j "* siIhoQettes,but questionable likeness
es, anyway the majority were guess
ed, Mrs. W. E. LaGrone getting
the largest number. This was a
style of picture of the colonial pe
riod Later the supper was served
which consisted of fried chicken,
hot biscuit, and other accompani
ments, with coffee and pound cake
with boiled custard and sil li bub.
s Miss Hortense Padgett spent the
week-end here with relatives.
Mr. Mims of New Orleans has
-bx^n-ior-a. -visit to hie Meters, Mrs.
Mamie Huiet and Miss Eliza Mims.
It has been twenty years since he
was here, and he found many
changes.
On Sunday morning at the Bap
tist church a unanimous call was
extended t? Rev. W. R. Brock of
?, Danville, Va. Rev. Hundley who
was present spoke in highest terms
of him, having known him since
childhood days, and stated that the
church would be very fortunate,
should they be able to, secure him.
Mrs. F. L. Pirker went to Au
gusta on Monday being joined there
by Messrs. Wallace and Eustace
Prescott, their father, Dr. W. E.
Prescott, undergoing a serious op
eration that day. Dr. Prescott is in
a very critical state, and an opera
tion has been resoned to as a means
of trying to relieve his condition.
* Miss Luelle Norris entertained a
few friends on Wednesday after
noon at the meeting of the Pi Tau
club the occasion being in honor of
Mrs. Ollie Hamilton,' who'was a
member of the elub before her mar
riage. Four tables of rook were en
joyed and at the conclusion Mrs.
Hamilton was presented with a
boudoir cap. The hostess assisted
by Miss Sara Norris and Mrs. M.
-, R. Wright, served a delightful re
past. The time was pleasantly spent
.so adieux were reluctantly said, not
only to the hostess but to Mrs.
Hamilton, for on the morrow, she
was to return to Virginia.
Reciprocity day was celebrated
here last Thursday by the New
Century club, the occasion being
held in the home of Mrs. Octavia
Rushton, Miss Olara Sawyer acting
S3 hostess for the club. The home
was attractive in decorations of the
club flower, the violet, and the
club colors green and white were
carried out. Although the elements
did their worst there were only a
few debarred from attending, these
being representatives from Trenton
and Ridge. The Edgefield organiza
tions were represented by Mesdames
N. G. Evans, Lovick Mims, Robert
Marsh and T. H. Rainsford, and
Batesburg, by Mesdames John Bell
Towel!, Price Timmerman and
Caldwell Cullum and Miss Nannie
Gunter. All the organizations of
the town were represented. This is
the fifth celebration of Reciprocity
day by the club and it is always
most pleasantly anticipated for the
great pleasure it affords by the
presence of these representatives
and then the delightful exchange of

Hardy's Weekly Happenings.
We were certainly sorry Thurs
day was such a bad, ugly day for
many reasons. First, on account of
that being the wedding day of Miss
Berta Hudson and Mr. Tom Math
is. Then when we beard in the af
ternoon, that Miss Irene Scott and
Mr. L. S. Reese had gone to North
Augusta to be married we were
more sorry for the two brides of
that ugly day. We said in our last
we heard of wedding bells over in
the fork or at Morgana. We also
heard of another of the fork girls
having married the week before in
Columbia, Miss Marie Taylor, but
did not learn the gentleman's name.
We can't blame the girls for marry
ing and leaving that malarial dis
trict. They have suffered so much
over there as well as over this way.
We hear that Mr. Will Briggs is
going to move his family to North
Augusts, as they have so many chills
op here. Mrs. Luther Reese and
Miss Georgia Reese have both been
very ill with chills for the past two
weeks. They were a little more
comfortable when we beard from
them last so we hope they are im
proving and will soon be up again.
Did you ever hear of so many chills
herein cold winter time? Why we
always used to think the chills
would stop when cold weather
came it would kill out the malaria,
but not so, the air seems lo be so
permeated with this malaria from
the water being over the lands that
nothing keeps the chills off now.
We were truly sorry to hear of
Mrs. Kalala McCarty's illness, and
hope she is on the road to recovery,
ere this.
Mr. and Mrs. James McClain are
moving out to their country place
out near Mr. H. F. Cooper on the
five notch road. We welcome them
and wish them much success and no
malaria and chills.
Mrs. Julia Townes and Miss Mary
Townes have returned home from
a week-end visit to Augusta and
North Augusta. The day being so
inclement on Thursday there was a
small attendance at the missionary
meeting which met at Mrs. Bunch's^
But those who braved the wind and
weather enjoyed the meeting and
were none the worst off for the out
ing we hope. Mrs. T. J. Briggs,
Mrs. John Roper, Mrs. Julia
Townes, Mrs. Harry Bunch and
children, Mrs. Luta Baynon, Mrs.
Sallie Bunch and Miss Lilla Bunch
were present. Had the day been
pretty we hoped to h .ve had many
others. The next meeting will be
held at Mrs. Julia Townes, Thurs
day, March 23. We hope the day
will be good, also attendance good.
The farmers have been cleaning
off and breaking land while the
weather looked and felt so much
like the spring had come, but as
winter came back and the cold
chilling blasts of freezing weather,
the wood saw is heard again buz
zing, cutting moie winier time fire
wood. The gasoline engine and
wood saw is a great convenience
and saving also of wood. The little
''Johnnie Boy," engine can churn
and pump water also which saves
the housewife and daughter as well
as men, many hard tasks. I wish
every home in the country were
equipped with all these convenien
ces, life would be more worth
living. We fear the fruit will be
killed. There are so many trees in
bloom, especially the pears and
plums, also a good many peach
trees. Easter comes late this'season,
so we may expect a good deal more
cold weather yet.

"One of the very worst habits of
boyhood is the cigarette habit. This
has long been recognized by all the
judges of the courts who deal with
young criminals, and especially by
judges of police courts, before
whom pass thousands of men every
year who are addicted to intemper
ate habits. Th?s? judges know that
in nearly every case the drunken
sots who appear before them, a dis
grace to their parents, themselves
and the state, began as boys smok
ing cigarettes. One bad habit led to
another. The nicotine and poison in
the cigarettes created an appetite
for alcoholic drink. The cigarette
habit not only had a grip upon
them in boyhood, but invited all
the other demons of habit to come
in and add to the degradation that
the cigarette began."-Ben B.
Lindsey.

We are having for the lait few
day? the roost disagreeable weather
of the winter. There has been
good deal of sickness in this com
munity since Christmas. Walter
Brunson, Jr., is just up from a spell
of pneumonia andris not able to get
out yet. *
Hugh Seigler, son or Mr. "Clack"
Seigler, has been real sick, but i?

The school improvement society
of the Brunson school at a meeting
last week decided to collect month
ly dues of lOcts per member for
improving the Behool. Miss Car
rie Collins is president of this soci
ety, having about 30 members and
hopes to have 40 on the roll soon.
Ten cents per month will raise a
snug little sum in 12 months.
We have had tho lumber sawed
for remodeling our school building
and when this is finished next sum
mer expect to have one.of the best
2-teacher 6chool9 in the county. All
we lack now is the building. Our
teachers, Misses Sara Stevens and
Carrie Collins, are planning to take
part in the field day exercises in
April.

Mr. WT. T. Reel, our enterprising
merchant, has on a reduction sale
to make room for spring goods. His
bargains are drawing a good trade.
Mrs. T. A. Williams, who re
turned from the Greenwood hos
pital two weeks ago is steadily im
proving.
Mr. Hugh Morgan who has been
with Mr. F. L. Timmerman for the
winter months has given up his po
sition and is goiug to Beaufort to
work on a truck farm.
The farmers around here are still
undecided about guano, a good
many having concluded tc use acid
and cotton seed meal mixed. All
have decided to use much less than
they have been using.
We have now had our R. F. D.
mail route a little over a year and
I don't see how we got along with
out it so long. The next thing we
want is a telephone to Edgefield
and would have had this last fall
but for the short crops. We will
make another effort next sommer.
Then we want a good doctor to lo
cate here. We are nine miles from
a doctor in any direction. In bad
weather when the roads are bad it
is almost impossible to ^et one.
I see they have succeeded in get
ting McCormick county. This I
guess will be the last slice to be
taken from old Edge?eid. She has
done her part in giving territory to
make new counties.

pious looking old man sitting near

SNDING THE CLAY.
Old Plank Road Transformed.
Sap Covered With Clay
by Public Spirited
Citizens.
Iri?frrder to improve the highway
le adufe' to Augusta, at that time
the po ly market for this section,
soDM^nblic spirited citizens about
50 years aero covered the road
from Edgell eld to Augusta by
wa;} of the "Pine House with
planks, which at that time was re
garded as the most scientific way of
improving a highway. The road
derived its name from the material
that was used in its construction.
In orderto re-imburso themselves
for the expense of constructing and
maintaining the road, the builders
charred toll, so much per horse for
each Vehicle that passed over it.
There-was a toll gate just south of
Edge?eld, one near the 'Pine
House*' and tw o between the latter
gate and Augusta. After the high
way bad been used a few years, the
progrjeiaive road hui I ders of fi fly ye?rs
ago learned from experience that
planking a road was a failure, being
altogether tooexpensive to maintain.
Had these men expended the
same amount of money in making a
slay "and sand road, which has
proven by government test to be the
bestct^ap method of road construc
tion, we would to-day have a good
road leading to Augusta.
Haying heard of the good work
.hat Supervisor Edmunds and some
public'spirited citizens are doing

went $pwn to see the transforma
ron 'that is being wrought. Mr.
VV. J. Hatcher, who was in Edge
rxeld f?r a few hours, took Dr. W.
B. Penn, Mr. Thomas W. Carwile
and tbs writer down in his hand

fromWre to the Pine House has ;
ic?i&th- in first-class condition by ,
ihe chafngang, the most" marked ;
improvement being the widening of
;he road and the claying of the .
leavy sand beds a short distance
^hid side of the Pine House. But j
3y great odds the most satisfactory
?york that we have seen on any
)f Edgefield's 1,500 miles of public
.oads is between the Pine House
ind the Aikenjcounty line. In many
placer it has been made wider, and
jspecially is Mr. Al bert Miller doing
?orne good work in making the
road wider neai his country home.
Last Thursday we found the road
corkers some distance below Mr.
VV. A. Pardue's home plowing up,
ihoveling and hauling cla> and
?overing the road bed to a depth of
?x inches. Supervisor Edmunds
bad one squad of the chaingaug mi
ler Mr. Walker on the work, and
they rendered valuable assistance.
But the men who projected the en
terprise and who are determined to
uarry it through to the Aiken line
are Mr. George Ti Swearingen, Mr.
E. M. Padgett and Mr. W. A. Par
due. They are the citizens whose
public spirit, enterprise and energy
have made possible the transform
ing of those bottomless sand beds
into a modern sand and clay road.
Wa found Mr. Swearingen superin
tending the loading of the wagons
at the clay pits and Mr. Padgett
was at the other end of the line
directing the unloading and the uni
form spreading of the clay.
With but few exceptions, citizens
of Trenton and farmers along the
road have contributed generously of
caeh and the use of their teams to
ward the rehabilitation of the old
plank road. The three men above
mentioned have not only contribu
ted of their teams and means but
have given days, and days of their
time, without which the good work
would never have been accomplish
ed. It would be unjust to the col
ored people who live on farms along
the road not to say that they too
have been loyal and generous.
Many of them have given their own
labor and service of their teams
more than a week al a timo in order
to improve the road which they
travel to market. They deserve
the thanks of the white people for
their commendable public spirit.
It is but proper, too, to state that a
goodly number of people iu the
town of Edget?eld have had a part
in the enteiprise by making liberal
cash contributions. The undertak
mg is not yet completed, however.
There is yet some distance to be

The Legacy of a Kindly Heart.
There was once a little girl in
Edgefield, nearly a quarter of a cen
tury ago now,'who came into ray
home with a message one day. and
she looked so pleasant and so sweet
that I said to her, "What a pretty
little girl you are," and she turned
her little head to one side, and said
'coquettishly, "You are pretty, too."
Now I didn't believe that she really
thought 1 was pretty, because no
one else had ever said so, but I knew
that she was anxious to please, and
that little bright face lives in my
memory still.
But that is not the only legacy,
nor the chief one that this little girl
left to Edgefield.
Some years after that this same
little girl, "a little older grown,"
was passing the Edgefield Hotel,
and there she saw walking up and
down on the sidewalk, a "pretty
lady," looking disconsolate perhaps,
or friendless, or wishing for some
thing she did not have. At any
rate, her child-heart was moved with
sympathy for this stranger whom
she had never seen, and approaching
her timidly she said, "Is theie any
thing I could do for you? and are
you in any sort of trouble?" The
"pretty lady" said: "No, not partic
ularly, but we came to Edgefield,
having been directed here by a
former resident and lover of Edge
field, that we, my husband and my
self, might enjoy the inland air and
the quiet and repose of your picture- .
esque village, but no one of those to
whom we have been directed has
found it convenient to receive us,
and so w? are here only for the
night, and will go away in the .
morning." "Oh, no," said the little 1
girl, "Do not go away so soon, stay
and see our town and our people.
Come now and go with me and I
will take you to my mother's home
on the other side of town. We ^
have seven or eight children at our i
house, and my mother has not room
you."
The stranger, as if overcome by .
this unexpected and welcome hospi- ,
tality, followed, without any con- ,
imitation, and they walked together ,
to the home of the little girl, who ,
carried her in and introduced her to ?
the mother, and to the aunt, who
for the past seventeen years, has
been the hostess each succeeding ,
winter of one of the most charming '
visitors who has ever come to Edge
field.
The guest of our town who came
and was led by a little child, is Isa
bel Potter of Rhode Island, and the I
little, girl was Julia Tompkins, who
after one short year of married life, i
passed out and carried hjr good ,
cheer to another world, where such
an atmosphere is perpetual-but the
friends whom she won, Mr. and
Mrs. Potter, are still coming on and
adding their happy personality to
the quiet town of Edgefield.
The little girl was "careful to en
tertain strangers, and thereby enter
tained angels unawares."
F. A. M.
reached and if other appeals are
made for funds the response should
be generous. Especially should
automobile owners take stock in the
enterprise. The making of the Plank
road a modern road, reduces the
distance to Augusta by practically
one-third and will cut the time in
making the trip almost in half.
Furthermore, this modern road
will be an object lesson to the coun
ty, and the splendid example of un
selfishness which the men who are
directing the work have set should
stimulate citizens in other parts of
the county to give the supervisor
generous aid in improving the main
thoroughfare? of other sections of
the county. Until the county su
pervisor is given more money or a
larger road working force, it will
be impossible for him to do other
than hurried, superficial work,
whi?h means continued bad roads
in wet weather. With the gener
ous aid of citizens, which aid can in
most cases be rendered without real
financial loss, miles and miles of
public roads can be permanently
improved each year.
The people of the county, and
particularly those who travel the
old Plank road in going to Au
gusta, owe Mr. George Swearingen
and his unselfish co-workers a last
ing debt of gratitude. The Adver
tiser moves that they be extended
a rising vote of thanks. j
