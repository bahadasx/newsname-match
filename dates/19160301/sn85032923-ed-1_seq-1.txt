PROPORTIONS.
LONDON. Feb. 28. The tide of
the battle around Verdun has appar
ently not turned to either sMc. While
the Germans claim further f.ances,
the French are equally emphatic that
they checked the attacks of the
masses of German infantry sent
against them. Fort Douaunjpnt has
fallen to the Germans, and it Ts Re
ported, is in ruins. Around this posi
tion there has been desperate fighting
since last Friday. Here French coun
ter attacks were delivered with such
crushing force that the German de
tachments were driven back and one
regiment almost encircled. Through
out the entire sector of Verdun, ex
cept on the western bank of the
Meuse, where the German bombard
ment 'nas slackened somewhat, the ar
tillery duels are still of vast propor
tions. Berlin Statement.
BERLIN, Feb. 28. Not only have
the attempts of the French to retake
Fort Douaumont failed but the Ger
man advance on Verdun continues,
according to the latest reports from
the front.
In rapid succession, Louvcmont,
Champncuville, Cote de Talou and
Haradumont were stormed. The Ger
mans, with 15,000 prisoners, are with
in five miles of the center of Verdun.
JFiles of railroad had to be repair
ed to transport the heavy scigc guns
and the French telephones lines had
to be destroyed to prevent the French
artillery interfering with the setting
up of the heavy pieces.
London Statement.
LONDON, Feb. 28 The great bat
tle of Verdun is entering on its second
week and continues with unabated
fury.
The Germans arc. driving hard at
the French defenses along an vcr
lengthening line that now runs be
yond the salient around the fortress.
Paris answers that, with heavy
French reinforcements, the Germans
have been checked. Berlin claims a
continuation of the forward march.
Not only is the impetuous German
drive at Verdun being pressed vigor
ously, although making! less rapid
progress than last week, by the crown
prince's forces, but an aggressive ac
tion has developed in the Champagne
district, where Berlin reports the cap
ture of nearly a mile of French
trenches.
There is a new movement on the
front nearer Paris.
North of Verdun the Germans ex
tended their lines to the west. The
loop of the river Meuse around Cham
pagnvillc has been cleared of French,
claims Berlin.
The French stopped the German
drive in the Fort Douaumont sector,
although, apparently the Germans
still hold the fort.

Diaz, watched for several months by

Berlin Insists
That Submarine
Policy Is Right
MERCHANTMEN ARMED
FOR DEFENSE WILL BE
TREATED BY HER AS
AUXILLIARY CRUISERS
AND SUBJECT TO THE
RULES OF WARFARE.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28. In a
note presented today to Secretary
Lansing by Ambassador Von Bern-
storff, Germany assures the United
States that she has no intention of re
voking the pledges given in the Lusi
tania case.
The note says that Germany can
conceive of no reason for changing
the instructions to her submarine
commanders to treat as warships all
enemy merchantmen that are armed
"defensively."
It adds that special precautions
have been taken to prevent any at
tack upon ships not armed.
The note states that armed British
merchantmen resist and attack sub
marines, citing a list of 20 incidents.
It makes it clear that Berlin believes
that the new instructions issued to
the commanders of submarines are in
accord with the views expressed by
the United States in the memoran
dum proposing a modus viviendi for
the disarmament of merchantmen.
It declares that submarines will not
destroy any ship on the ground of
armament unless it is known positive
ly that such armament exists. It
formally states that previous pledges
will not be revoked.
The note further states that a sub
marine commander cannot be expect
ed to warn an enemy merchantman
which claims the right to fire on the
submarine which warns it.
Germany -contends that the pres
ence of equipment and the intention
to resist do not come within the
meaning of "defensive armament."
Germany contends further that a sim
ilar view was taken by the United
States, which recently secured assur
ances from the Italian government
that its armed merchant ships leaving
American ports would not fire on
submarines which wdrncd them.
The note says that Germany did
not issue the new instructions by the
British government to the command
ers of merchantmen.
Germany takes the position that
arming merchantmen for defense is
a matter of tradition rather than a
rule of international law and con
ends that she finds nowhere in the in
ternational code any specific author
ity for arming. She claims that the
practice has arisen from custom rath
er than from any fixed rule.
Congress today gave tlie armdd
ship question but little attention.
Representative Cooper of Wisconsin,
issued a statement saying he thought
the foreign affairs committee is en
titled to the correspondence of the
United States with the belligerent
nations regarding the rights of bclig
crcnts and neutrals. "More than
anything, secret diplomacy has caused
the European war." said Cooper. "We
want no secret diplomacy in this
country to plunge the United States
into war, or into a position that
might make war practically inevit
able." o
