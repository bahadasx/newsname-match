I'arenNTcacher Association Holds
Regular Monthly Meeting;
Tuesday.
On Tuesday afternoon tho First Dis
trict I'aront-Tcachcr Association hold
lfs regular monthly meeting. The
president, Mrs. Will Smith, called tho
meeting to order.
Miss Estella M. Nash and her quar
tet of four little girls, Alice Kuhn,
Violet Finch, Edith Literal and Mary
Nichols, furnished somo excellent
music. It was an cnoynblo feature.
Tho president Introduced Iter. H, B.
Wllhoyto of tho First Baptist church,
who spoke upon "The Conservation of
Youth." Tho tnlk was full of interest
and It should havo had n larger hear
ing. Ho said that tho Idea that man
was a triangular being is wrong, that
man Is a four-square, quoting from St
Luko 2:52: "Ho grow in stnturo, phys
ically; wisdom, mentally; in favor
toward God, spiritual; and man, so
cial. Christ taught that tho four
square was tho Ideal, physical, men
tal, spiritual and social.
Ho insisted upon a healthy phys
ical body, for a good mind. The
soul Is tho spiritual relation to God,
God always has tho spiritual first and
then tho social. So rear and train
tho child that tho four sides shall be
properly and fully developed.
Tho hope of tho future is tho con
servation of tho youth today. This
is an age of delegation. We no longer
chop wood, wo havo delegated It to
tho coal company; the handling of
coal makes our hands black. Wc
have delegated that to tho gas com
panies. Tho father, while the dele
gating is going on, compliments the
mother by delegating the rearing of
tho child, tho buying of the clothing
and the education and spiritual train
ing to the mother, and the mother in
turn delcgacs part of tho burden to
the teacher.
He spoke of environment, obedience,
work, truanoy, sanitation and play in
their relation to his subject. Does it
pay? Is It better to form than to
reform? Tho mother has tho biggest
task over committed to tho race, to
conserve the child given to her to rear.
.Tho association Is doing a flno work.

AdmonNlicd Ily .Miss Lois Janvier To
Look For Something
Real To Ho.
Now Orleans, March 1. Miss Lois
Janvier, whoso father Is Charles Jan
vier, this town's now postmaster and
a banker of renown nil over tho south,
Is social secretary for a fashionablo
department store.
Admirers spent $10,000 on her for
clothes nnd entcrtnlnment when slio
was queen of tho carnival In 1912.
This $10,000 queen addressed a meet
ing of Y. W. C. A. girls tho other day
and said:
"After a girl has had her year in
society sho should look about for
something real to do. If a debutante
dies sho Is not missed, becauso she
was of no use to anybody, but If one
or tho girls In tho store were to die
thero'd be ten or more persons asking
for her In ono day."
Miss Janvier's admonition to debu
tantes evidently has been taken seri
ously, for already half a dozen "buds"
are turning to things other than teas,
tango parties and automobiles.
Miss Bottle Wilkinson, daughter of
Mr. nnd Mrs. Hugh Wilkinson, nieco
of n former United States Senator, is,
taking cooking lessons three days n
week In high school.
Miss Elizabeth Lymnu, queen of the
Mittens' ball of 1916, declares she
agrees, with Miss Janvier.
The Miss Janvier referred to In the'
nbovo article 13 a Bister to Mr. John
Janvier, former editor of The Ledger.
The Janvier family has" boon promi
nent In soclnl circles in the south for

THE HDME OF QUALITY GLDTHEB
If there ever was a time for serious contemplation about clothes needs that
moment has arrived. If, next winter, you are asked to pay advances on clothes that
will strike you as steep, don't blame any retailer. Woolens have soared to unprec
edented heights; you know something about the wool situation yoursel f, by the way
it is selling here; dyestuffs are alarmingly scarce; trimmings have gone 'way up;
even labor is better paid than ever before.
You Can't Dodge These Things
They Are Facts!
But here is something you can do, and that is to get an extra suit NOW
while we are selling Society Brand, Stein-Bloch, R. B. Fashion, Hirsh-Wickwire,
and Michaels, Stern & Co. clothes and other clothes at greatly reduced prices.
