Two years ago, when Hi Gill besought the people of Seattle to (Jive him another
chance in the mayor's chair, he told, in a quavering voice, how he wanted his boys
to be able to say that, altho their father might have been a bad mayor, the second

campaign on a frank plea to the sympathy of the voters. They gave him his chance.
t Now picture Hi Gill, after two years, running for the office again in violation of his pledged word! Picture his opponent — honest, scholarly,
clean-minded, aggressive a man of family, respected by all! And picture Gill the Gill whose own return to office was the result of an appeal for

A Statement by Austin L Griffiths
IT IS with an earnest desire to be of
service in a practical, efficient way
that I am Keeking the office of mayor.
1 want to see this great city of ours
free from the petty quarrels and the
constant turmoil which have raged
within it in past years.
I want it to be free of the strife
which attaches to a city too busy with
a moral problem or a police problem
to give attention to the problems of
scientific efficiency in city administra
tion.
In the yearn that have gone by, I have given the
subject of city government much study.
From lime to tune I have gone to other cities to
study their ways and mean# of handling our prob
lem*. I have been in tHe council and I have been
chief of police.
It has been my g«H>d fortune to have had my
work tn lnrth f he*e office* pralwd hv the ptthhc
pre** of the city, as well as by private individuals.
Neither on taxation, public morals, or on any other
important i**ue, has my record been a**atled until
Mr. .(lill, with wanton disregard for the facts, has
*een fit to hurl epithet and abuse uj>on me and mine.
From the i**ue - of a decent city, Mr ("lill flhtche*.
He says the i**ue Is taxation I *ay it i* l>oth.
Hut let us accept the taxation i**ue.
I challenge Mr. (iill, or the newspaper or newn
paper* supporting him, t" point to any a> t in my
official life which makes me unworthy of support on
a taxation issue.
On the other hand, I repeat that when
Mr. (iill was in the council, he piled up
enormous debts upon this city which we
arc still paving, and the proof of it is con
tained in the editorial words of the Post-
Intelligencer itself in the issue of I cb
ruary 27. 1 (^14.
The Post-Intelligencer thus summar
ized (fill's taxation record in the council
and as mayor:
"Mr. Gill's administration was ineffi
cient. incompetent, and extravagant —so
reckless and costly that the tax levy be
came the highest in the city's history.
THE TAXPAYERS ARE TODAY
RAY IXC, THE BILLS."
I he facts are exactly as the Post-Intel
ligencer said they were. Whenever (fill
dominated the council and the mayor s
office, the taxes DID grow year by year.
When I entered the council in 1911, the city was
choking with street assessments up to $<~000,000 a
year. That was a heritage from Mr. Gill's old wanl
regime.
I got over $2,700,000 pending and future street
improvements reduced in interest from 7 to 6 per
cent, and had the time of payment extended from
five to ten years.
The general fund was then paying several hun
dred thousand dollars a year f<>r all sort- of street
improvements. It was used for this purpose like com
mon loot by the ward councilmcn. I got the new
council to Mop this practice.
In 1911, I sought to reduce the budget by $670,-
000 The plain record in the case is on file at the
city hall and in the issues of the daily papers of
that day.
I voted against raising the mayor's salary. I
voted against raising nearly every salary which was
above the $100 mark. Hut I voted to increase wages
in all proper tases where wages were under $100
per month.
I tried each year to reduce the budget without
crippling the city. I voted against the tax budgets
when they were too large.
As chief, 1 dropped the expensive police cavalry.
1 asked for no increase in the budget for I'M 5. My
predecessor asked an increase of $150,1X10. MY
Sf< CI SSOK (MR. I,AN<J) ASKI.I) AN IN
CH KASK OF $235,000.
But to cap the climax, Mr. Gill says I voted for
the present dam site.
The facts are that I voted against it.
I voted against going ahead on this project with
SI£AT I I I:. WASH.. \\ HUNIiSDAY, MARCH 1, 1016.
By Austin E. Griffiths
out further investigation. MY OBJECTIONS ARE
ON FILE IN WHITING AT THE CITY HALL.
On the contrary, Mr. Ciill, in 1910, got
the dam site fixed in front of a gravel bar
bank. Ile did this in spite of warnings as
to this bank sieve.
HIS SIC »N ATI RK AS MAYOR IN
1910 Is PLAINI\I FIXED TO
Till- ORDINANC I IN THIS CASK.
AND IT IS ON I ILK A I THK CITY
HALL.
Again, as mayor in 1914. Mr. (till got
the council to increase the height 45 feet,
at a further cost of $205,000.
If he wished to shirk responsibility for
whatever blunder had been made on the
dam. \\ hy did he not veto this additional
cost?
But he spent that money in spite of a
further warning by a board of experts.
This left no money with which to seal
the bank.
For more than a year the dam has
been empty. Dry dams pile up taxes.
Recklessness makes dry dams.
Mr. Gill ha«, in this campaign, "-ecu fit to utter a
!• >t of malicious falsehood* against me. I have en
deavored to be fair, and he puts words into my mouth
I have never spoken.
He has deliberately stepped aside from the issues
to make bitter personal attacks upon me and mine
that arc without basis or foundation.
It is but fair that I should brand them for the
falsehoods that they are.
Mr. (till has said that I am circulating some sort
of report in the old A. I\ A. organization.
It is absolutely untrue. I have never had any
connection with that organization, and have never
circulated any report of any kind in it.
I was not here when such an organization existed.
1 have no prejudice against any <>ne on account
of race, color or religion, and Mr. Gill i< •■ccking de
liberately to placc me in a false light in this con
nection.
I try to treat each person on his merits, the same
as F like to lie treated.
We are all working together to build up our com
mon country.
I II \VF. NO WORDS STRONG ENOUGH TO
EXPRESS MY SUPREME DISGUST AT THIS
\TTEMPT TO INIKt'T RELIGIOUS I F.ELING
IN A CITY CAMPAIGN.
I did not vote $250,000 f<>r the Firlands hospital,
as Mr. Gill has been *aying in all his speeches. Had
it not been f<>r me, tin* bond issue probably would
have been $230,000. I kept it down to $125,000.
I left the council before the institution was fin
ished.
Incidentally, I desire to say that this institution
•-hould. in all fairness t>> the city, be conducted by
the state, f<>r it confers a state-wide benefit.
As to the Tukwila light service, I was not in the
council when $10,000, or $IK,OOO, or any other sum,
was voted to extend our city light system outside the
citv limits.
Gil.l. SPEAKS AN UNTRUTH WHEN HE
SAYS I DID VOTE FOR IT.
Mr. Gill, in his speeches, lias falsely quoted me as
saying I would save $1,000,000 a year.
What I did say is, that with the aid of the coun
cil, we could and would save from $300,000 to $500,-
000 a year without impairing the normal growth of
the city.
Answering his question directly, 1 shall not abol
ish the platoon system in the fire department.
I was in favor of it when it needed friends, AND
WHEN MR. GILL WAS SILENT.
I shall help the fire department as well as the
police department to become the pride of the city.
It is only fair to ask Mr. Gill to dis
cuss facts and actual conditions.
I have lived in this city for many
years. My children have been raised
here.
I submit it is not the province of a
mayor seeking re-election to dodge
facts and actual conditions, and to
mouth the foulest untruths on subjects
that do not concern the city.

CONGRESS TO
BACK WILSON
Leaders Agree to "Showdown" When

Jones Remains Stubborn.
New GERMAN ORDERS WENT INTO EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT
BY CHARLES P. STEWART
United Press Staff Correspondent
LONDON, March I.—The Teutonic proclamation of war on
armed merchantmen went into effect at midnight Thus far
there have been no results. No definite reports of torpedoing
are expected for a day or two.
The situation here is similar to fiat prevailing at the dawn
o» the first German submarine campaign, more than a year ago.
bhippmg men are divided in their opinion as to what Austria
and Germany will do. Some regard the decree as a "bluff."
Great Britain contends the campaign is without justification,
and holds, officially, that the Germans hava distorted English
orders, seized from captive ships, to maka It ap#«ar that the ad
miralty has ordered armed merchant ships to attack subma
rines.
WASHINGTON. March I.—Congress will soon go
on record as to the administration's course toward Ger
many.
Leaders today ratified President Wilson's proposal to
Acting Chairman Pou of the house rules committee for a
test of strength as to warning Americans off armed mer
chantmen and discussed with him the means of getting
such a vote.
Since it is the president's purpose to demonstrate to Ger
many that the country supports him in the international situ
ation. the leaders will frame the issue to hrinp out that ideai
l'veti while taking steps for a "showdown," some leaders
indicated their disbelief that congress—the house, at least
is willing to support the president whole-heartedly.
A complication in the Wilson
program of getting a vote came
today, with the announcement
of Senator Jones of Washington
th»t he would object to unani
moui content for immediate
consideration of a resolution
supporting the president.
While the government gravely
awaits the first Austro-German
shot In the new campaign
against armed merchantmen
the capitol prepared today fof
the "snowdown" on the Wilson
program as a result of his re
quest to Representative Pou,
acting rules committee chair
man, for a vote on the queition
of warning Americans from
armed ships.
Negotiations with the centra!
powers wait while the contest be
twi>en congress and President Wil
son Ik put into motion.
Congress In Turmoil
Congress is in a turmoil over the
Wilson challenge.
The administration is confident
Its hands will lie upheld, despite
the recent claim of Speaker Clark
that the house stood 2 or 3 to 1 In
favor of a warning.
There was little chance of a
final vote today In either house.
Inasmuch as the president's letter
to Pou suggested "full public dis
cussion."
Senators Stone and Kern and
Representative Flood conferred
with the prcsld nt at the White
House today. The conference lust
ed for nearly an hour.
Vote on Straight Warning
It was agreed that the test vote
would be on a straight warning
resolution. Including the cxact con
troversy about sustaining American
rights of travel on armed ships.
Flood said his foreign committee
would bring out a new resolution,
which Wilson will approve before
the committee reports it.
"In the light of events," said
Flood. "I think there is little ques
tion that all members of congress
«11l support the president."
The letter to Pou caused a sen
sation. as none of the leaders had
an Inkling of the president's de
termination to force the issue.
Demands United Support
in sending his message to Pou.
the president pointed out that for
eign capitals might be adversely In
fluenced by news of any lack of
support for the government by
congress.
He said stories of difference
were being made "Industrious use
of" abroad.
WILSON'S STAND
NOW EXPLAINED
Stands for International Law
to Avoid International
Anarchy
FEARS FOR THIS NATION
WASHINGTON, March I.—Her*
are the two greatest American
question* of the day:
"Shall the United States sub
mlt to the torpedoing without
warning and the safe removal
cf passengers of unarmed mer
chant ships of belligerent na
tions?
"Shall the United States sub
mit to the torpedoing, without
warning and the safe removal
of passengers, of ARMED mer
chant ships of the belliger
ents?"
No. says President Wilson, and
liis cabinet, because such action—
In either case—by Germany Is
against International law.
What Ir the law—the Interna
tional law—on the subject?
The international law on both
questions is written in the custom
of nations for scores anil hundreds
of years. Ml civilized nations have
respected the custom for so long
thut NONE OF THEM -NOT KVKN
GKRMANY denies that such is the
law of nations THE PROOF OF
I Ills. \\l> THE BINDING NA-
Tl RE OF IT IS SHOWN BY THE
FACT THAT THE ROLEB OF
EVERY NAVY IN THE WORLD.
INCLUDING GERMANY'S NAVY,
INSTRUCT OFFICERS IN AC
CORDANCE WITH THE LAW
THAT MERCHANTMEN SHALL
NOT HE SI NK WITHOUT DUE
WARNING. AND THAT MER
CHANTMEN HAVE A RIGHT Tt)
GO ARMED.
President Wilson's contention is
that America must uphold every In
ternational law us It was made by
civilized nations before the war.
Inasmuch as these laws were
made by all nations, all nations
must first consent to change them.
President Wilson's whole policy
can bo summed up briefly as fol
