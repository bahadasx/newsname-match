thus far was unable to determine
whether claims set forward by Ger

Moreover, it has not yet been de- 1

Meanwhile, if any Americ-.n citizen

a grave situation will arise.
The I'nited States stands at this
lime as it has always done, for the
rights of American citizens t travel
w ith safety on defensively armed ships.
If the German contentions are sus
tained, however, and it is proved con
clusively that a ship upon which an
American may be injured, used defen
sive armament for purposes of offense,
it is considered unlikely that this gov
ernment will take any action. It never
has contended that shins committing
attacks or other offensive acts, or un
der orders to so conduct themselves,
are immune from mmmary destruc

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
With the lessening of the activity of
the contending forces to the north o."
Verdun, the French in the Woevre re
gion, east of Verdun, are using their
artillery to. break up German prepara
tions for further advances toward the
fortress. At various points, the fire of
the French guns has prevented the
Germans from launching offensives. '
In the Vosges mountains there also
has been great artillery activity by the
French near Senones and Ban De Saptj
while near Seppois the Germans have
been driven out of trenches they had
i previously taken. In the Champagne,
German fortified works in the region
of Hill 193 have been battered by the
French guns and the crater of a mine
exploded by the Germans was occu
pied by the French.
The Germans have added several
additional points to their terrain in the
fighting about Verdun, having been
enabled to construct trenches on the
slopes north of the Cote Du Poivre and
to capture an armored work northwest
of Douaumont and have taken the
towns of Manhuelles and Champion,

This is because the nature of modern
warfare has almost done'iway !th
the necessity for shooting horizontal!,',
it being- possible to reach horiZ M.ul

tion shooting vertically.
" Modern artillery notwithstanding its
tremendous strides, he says has in no
wise reached the limits of its possibil'-
ties, either in effectiveness or in carry

he believes, will be able to penetmte
the strongest fortified shelters and
nullify "Kngland's shimmering ocean
armament, the old proud wall which
for centuries has protected it fio o the
continent," x
The Krupp firm perfected .'.le 42

to Professor Rausenberger, but it was
only shortly before the outbreak of the
war that it was found possible to make
these giant cannon independent of
i.iilroads and easily transportable.
The forts of the future, he believes,
will differ vastly from those of the
present. The inventor pays his com
pliments to American ammunition,
which he says Lh infinitely better today
than at the beginning of the war. Kx

Republican A. Leased Wire
LONDON, Feb. 29 That German
submarines have been sowing mines off
Dover was the belief expressed today
by Ralph Foster of Kansas and other
survivors of the Maloja disaster, includ
ing some of the officers of the ship.
The fact that a number of disaster?:
have occurred in the neighborhood of
Dover during the hist two Sundays 1b
considered as possible evidence that
German submarines, knowing that a
number of boats are to clear for foreign
ports Saturdays, have taken adva
tage of that fact to creep in as near the
coast as posible in the night time and
discharge cargoes of explosives.
In the opinion of Sir. Foster, life belts
are useless where ships strike mines,
as the ships almost invariably sink
quickly, and because the crews are
drilled insufficiently for quick action
:uid the boats cannot be lowered when
a ship heels over on her side as tho
Maloja did.
Mr. Foster had a thrilling experienc.
j He was afloat in the icy water and on
Unturned boats an hour before he was
rescued.
"I was promenading the deck well
forward about 10:20 o'clock Sunday
moming," said Mr. Foster today to the
Associated Fress representatives.
! "when X heard a slight report. I
thought it was a gun firing a blank
shot until 1 saw debris' falling. Kveu
then, the concussion had been so slight
: that I concluded an accident must have
happened to some other ship near by.
"liefore 1 had taken a dozen steps
1. . , , , , ,,
I toward the stern, the ship began to list.
and I started toward the life boat that
had been alloted to my cabin. It was
so full of people, most of them Lascars,
that I saw it was likely to be swamped,
so 1 went below for a life belt. 1 put
on my overcoat and the life belt and
also took my passport.
"By this time hardly three minutes
after the explosion the passageways
below were awash. I returned to the
life, boat and tried to help shove it
clear.' Two white members of the crew
were standing by, but only a steward
and myself w:ere making any effort to
push the boat from the ship s side. Wo
could not get it clear because of the
heavy list.
"Everybody then piled out of the lifa
boat. Most of them slid across the deck
and into the water on the other side.
I grabbed an oar and slid into the wa
ter. ' The waves were so -strong that
1 was dashed against the side of tho
ship.
"Finally I reached a capsized boat a

present year of $30,000,000 of the two
per cent l.'nited States bonds used by
national banks to secure their not
circulation.
This was regarded by board member
as the most important action affect
ing the reserve system taken in many
months. There is outstanding more
than $70fl,0i.000 worth of these two
per cent bonds, a total that has not
varied heretofore, with the result that
the amount of national bank notes in
I circulation has been fixed no matter
whether money was tight or easy.
The reserve act provides for the re
tirement of the twos in twenty yea,
the national bank currency gradually
being replaced by federal reserve notes,
based upon commercial paper and gold
and counted upon by the framers of
the law to respond to the demands
of business.
Machinery is provided in the reserve
act for the retirement of the twos by
their refunding in thirty year 3 pcf
cent bonds on which currency cannot
be based, and one year United State
gold notes.
The law says that reserve bank
c!;il Ve required to purchase total
of ' S2a,0'n,C'0O ( the two rt tAt
from banks which are members of the
system each year if the, banks desire
to get rid of this amount."
Mr. McAdoo, however, on ad' ice of
counsel, has decided that this provision
cf the law covers only two per cent
bonds held by national banks against
w hich they have issued bank currency
and not bonds held by reserve banks
for Investment purposes, and agaiiift
which there is no outstanding circulation.
