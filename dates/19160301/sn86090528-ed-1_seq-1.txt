who was public-spirited and who has
ene much toward building up the gen
vral community.
A n officer of the bank, Mr. Can

was conservative and careful and
painstaking in the manner In which

er and was ambitious to the last de
gree In hi efforts to make his bank

Years of faithful service has demon
strated that too much that H good can
not bo said of the man now dead."

WITH THE BRITISH BATTLE
CRUISER SQUADRON, somewhere in
the North sea, Feb. 18.-v(By Mail.)
Standing placidly at anchor, but in
iormiuaDlo array, the British navy's
' fighting veterans" of the battles of
Heligoland Light and Doggorbank wero
still waiting for the Germans to come
out today.
Great, long grey warships, their
engines ready to turn the propellers
and light greyhound ish,scout cruisers
and swarms of diminutive black de
stroyers and torpedo boats, all fully
manned and ready for action, appeared
anxious and willing today to be off
in chase of battle.
I By ccurtesy of the British admiralty
1 was able to see at close range the
real reason why there has been no
naval warfare in the North sea since
January 4, 1915, when the German
Blucher was sunk and the Derrfiinger,
Mollke and Seidlitz were forced to run
to cover in the German minefields.
Since that time the German fleet has
remained at home.
Preparedness personified in ships
and men, the British squadron is ready
to remain thus for years, if necessary.
according to the officers and men with
whom I talked.
Well ahead in the battle line is thn
1 iger, 700 feet of the same fighting ,
cat that showed her teeth tothe Blu
cher iu the Doggerbank action. A
dented armor plate just above the wn
terline, mark of a final shot from tho
Blucher, is a lasting memento still
carried by the Tiger. The shell was
from one of the Teuton's 11 inch guns.
Tiger's officers declare. It failed to
penetrate the nine inch belt1 of Krupp
armor, while the Tiger's 13 Inch guna
were perforating the equally "krupp-
armored" German battle cruiser.
Berlin still believes that the Tiger
war. sunk in tnis action, a possioie
forecast of future German naval war
fare in tbe North sea and an explana
tion of why the German tellef is firm
that the Tiger went down was given
by one ot the Tiger's officer. When
the Blucher turned her massive hull
to view, a Zeppelin appeared 10,000
feet above and dropped bombs in tha
vicinity of the 'boats of the British
fleet "busy picking up the Blutcher's
survivors.
Observers on the air ship saw tho
Blucher's death, struggle and assumed
that it was the Tiger. The word .was
carried back to Berlin and officially
anncunced to the world before Ger-
. .1 1 IL
many saw fit to announce mat
Blucher was sunk, ft was the same
old Tiger, however., which the writer
inspected from stem to stern today,
and seeing is believing.
Not far astern the Tiger stood the
other member of the battle squadron's
cat family. It was tho Lion, bristling;
with gitns, big and small, primed and
leady for any emergency. Nearby lay
the New Zealand, a gift to the navy
'rom New Zetland in 1910. and which
made a record trip around tho world
just before the war. The Princess
Royal, 700 trim feet ot fighting ship,
also ws nearby, keeping silent com
pany with tne other fleet units, tM
identities of which must remain Ad
miralty secrets.
Th battle cruiser squadron Is wait
ing for something out of the air which
will set dozens of engines racing to
ward the open sea and cause hundred
ot officers, gunners and stokers and
thousands or seamen to jump to their
batlls statfr s. Less than ten minutes
after the "prepare for action" comes
from the flagship the leading soout
cruiser w ill be tearing out to sea. Clcs
behind, a few moment later, wilt
