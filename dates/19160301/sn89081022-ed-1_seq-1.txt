state levy, each county and its sub
divisions has entire control over the
amount of money raised for public
Tposes by taxation.
*y,
Armson referred to growing tax
rat/cfy 'iroughout the state and said
that $ sors are frequently blamed
for grow fy'e *ax burdens, while, as a
matter of & they are not respons
ible for a high tax nor are they en
titled to credit for a low tax rate.
He said that it is not the assess
me. that determines whether a tax
will be high or low but the amount vt
money spent for public purposes.
I^arge appropriations mean high taxes.
When a community is spending a
large amount of money, taxes will in
evitably be high, but the assessor as
an officer has absolutely nothing to
say about how much money shall be
spent for any public purpose. Mat
ters of expenditures are determined
by town meetings, school meetings,
village and city councils, county
boards and the state legislature and
The people themselves have absolute
control over the very thing that deter
mines tax rates—expenditures. This
control is exercised either directly
through school and town meetings, or
indirectly through the elective officers
of the various other units of govern
ment—village, city, county and state.
If, therefore, tax rates are unreason
ably high the fault is with the people
rather than with assessors.
But while the assessor has nothing
to do with making taxes high or low,
he has nearly everything to do with
determining whether they shall be
fair and just. It is his function to
determine how much of the public bur
den each taxpayer shall bear. This
he does when he places a value on a
taxpayer's property. If he does his
work in accordance with law approxi
mate justice will prevail between the
taxpayers of his district but, on the
other hard, if he departs from the
legal standard of valuation, or omits
any considerable amount of property
from the tax list, injustice in taxation
will inevitably follow. It is therefore
of the highest importance that all tax
able property be listed and assessed
in strict compliance with law.
He said that in a general way grow
ing tax rates are largely due to the
expanding functions of government—
state and local—and to an increasing
demand on the part of the people for
more things and better things from
each of the units of government We
now demand and insist that numerous
things be done by government that we
did for ourselves years ago or left un
done entirely. To do these numerous
things revenues are necessary, and
the necessary revenue must be raised
by some form of taxation, so that ev
ery expansion of the functions of gov
ernment entailing the expenditure of
money must inevitably be followed by
higher taxes.
High tax rates do not necessarily
mean extravagant expenditures. If
the money derived from tax lewesis"
wisely and economically expended the
benefits derived by the taxpayer may
fully compensate for a high tax rate.
This is a question, however, that each
district must decide for itself.
Mr. Armson briefly analyzed the
amount and purpose of the tax levies
of Kandiyohi county. The total tax
levy in the county last year and pay
able this year amounted to $307,465.74.
Each $100 of this amount, when col
lected, will be apportioned as follows:
To the state for support of state gov
ernment and state institutions, $6.57
to the county, $19.19 to the towns,
$3 10 to the cities and villages, $12-76
to education, $33.93 and to roads and
bridges, $24.45.
The total state levy in Kandiyohi
couny last year, including the state
levy for schools and road's and bridges
amounted to $48,102.60 while the coun
ty received $63,371.58 from the state
in aid of schools, roads and other lo
cal purposes. Expressed in another
way, for each dollar you levied for
state purposes last year, including
schools and roads and bridges, you re
ceived from the state in aid of schools,
roads and other public purposes, $1.32
in return These figures show that
direct taxes, in their final analysis are
levied almost entirely for local pur
poses.
More or less discussion has taken
place of late as to relative tax rates in
the rural districts and in cities and
villages. In comparing rates it should
be borne in mind that farm or unplat
ted lands are taxed on a basis of one-

Local Secretary Attends State Meet
ing and is Enthused to Rally
Local Organization.
M. R. Simons attended the directors
meeting of the Minnesota State Auto
mobile Association at St. Paul Feb. 1.
He reports an interesting meeting.
The big question discussed was the
high price of oil. An investigating
committee was appointed to gather
data and co-operate with other bodies
in fighting this arbitrary action of the
oil kings. Highways' also came in
for a good share of the discussion.
There seemed to be a unanmous sen
timent in favor of utilizing convict
labor on the highways, which system
is successfully used in other states.
Mr. Simons returned enthusiastic
about the work of the association, and
hopes that the local club will respond
to the work of the association better
in 1916 than ever before. He is the
secretary, and reports that the mem
bership in good standing is sixty-five,
which he believes should be at least
165. The annual meeting date is
March 31, and notices will be mailed
later. Mr. Simons was appointed on
the State Committee on Tours and
Contests.
