each candidate, in this language:
"Dear Sir: Referring to the published announcement of your
candidacy for office, we wish to take this occasion to bring to your

proposed measures, and to secure pre-election promises governing i
candidates' attitude toward various matters of public interest.
"Should you be approuched with a request for pre-election prom

the end that the cause of truly representative government may not
