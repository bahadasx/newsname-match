A VICTORY FOR JEFFREY
Congress Will Pass Bill Restricting
Immigration By Large Vote.
William H. Jeffrey of East Burke,
chairman of the National Legislative
committee of the Junior Order United
American Mechanics, has just return
ed from a visit to Washington where
he has been in consultation with mem
bers of congress on the Burnett Immi
gration bill. It will be remembered
that for several years Mr. Jeffrey's
order has been contending for a liter
acy test on all persons seeking admis
sion to this country. A similar meas
ure has been before the last two ad
ministrations and has passed both
branches of Congress and was vetoed,
first by President Taft and two years
ago by President Wilson. At their
national session, recently held at Ced
ar Point, Ohio, the Juniors placed Mr.
Jeffrey in charge of their legislative
department and a very vigorous, nation-wide
campaign has been conduct
ed for the success of this bill at this
time. Mr. Jeffrey reports that the
bill now before Congress will be up
for action in the House of Representa
tives this week and that before the end
of the week will pass- by a vote slight
ly more than two to one. He predicts
that in the Senate it will receive fully
three to one.! From these figures It
would appear that this very beneficial
piece of legislation is very likely to be
written into the laws of the country.
It is understood that all four of Ver
mont's delegation are solid vfor the
bill.
United States Senator Borah of Ida
ho, writing Mr. Jeffrey, recently said:
"When the European war shall be
closed we will have greater need for
an effective immigration bill than we
have ever had in our history. We will
find that the laboring men of this
country are going to be brought into
competition, first with the cheap labor
of Europe by way of cheap goods and
second, in competition with cheap la
bor by the immigration" which will
likely come. There is only one course,
in my judgment, to pursue and that
is to protect this country against both
cheap goods ' and cheap labor by an
effective protective tariff and by an
effective immigration bill."
The splendid work done by our
fellow Vermonter will be greatly ap
preciated and the country at large is
to be congratulated that the prospects
for a real immigration law is so very
promising. The bill will keep out the
diseased, the paupers, the criminals.

known when the hearing will be held.
Legendre has sold his barber shop to

ness in this section. He was held on

MUST TAKE OATH
Women In St. Johnsbury .Can't
Yote Unless They Do Tax De
linquents Cannot Vote
According to a decision of the Board
of Civil Authority the women of St.
Johnsbury will not be allowed to vote
on school matters next Tuesday unless
they take the Freeman's Oath and
have their names pu on the check
list. Town Clerk Braley sent out
notices to that effect yesterday after
noon. The Board of Civil Authority also
considered the question whether a de
linquent tax payer could vote in the
coming town meeting or not. They
decided that the attorney general of
the state having given an opinion that
such delinquents could not vote they
would decide in accordance with his
opinion and ordered the names of all
delinquents stricken from the check
lists. The fact a test x case was brough'
before the Supreme Court of Vermont
last Monday when a delinquent tax
payer asked that his name be placed
on the check list in the town of Brook
field made Town Clerk Braley delay as
long as possible notifying these de
linquents that their names had been
stricken from the list. It was his In
tention to act in accordance with the
decision- of the court. But up to last
night no decision had been handed
down and unless it comes in time so
the plan can be changed, if it is in
favor of the delinquents being allowed
to vote on state questions, the names
of the delinquents in St. Johnsbury
will be stricken. If the court decides
they have the .right to vote a separate
check list will be prepared if there is
time to do so.
The last meeting of the Board of
Civil Authority for correction of the
check list will be held at the town
clerk's office next Saturday, Mar. 4.

FLYING SQUADRON SPEAKER
O. W. Stewart of Chicago Plead for
the Perry Prohibition Act.
A very enthusiastic meeting in the
cause of temperance was held at the
Colonial Thursday evening with a rec
ord attendance. Rev. Paul Dwleht
ed by Rev. P S. Tolman. The speaker
was Hon. Oliver W. Stewart of Chi
cago, of the Flying Squadron, and he
proved to be a persuasive and enter
taining talker: He claims to be an
Irishman and surely has the ready wit
which characterizes that race. He
made it plain that the liquor traffic is
not a business, is not a source of reve
nue and is of no advantage to any
town, state or nation. The saloon is
a counterfeit of business. It Is a busy
place, has a fine display of bottles In
the show window, but its finished prod
uct is never on exhibition; that, the
poor old drunkard you will find kept
out of sight as much as possible in the
back alley. Property and labor are
the only real sources of revenue, and
the saloon destroys both. A thing
which makes paupers and criminals
out of decent, thrifty people is not to
be desired by any community, large or
small. Prohibition does not interfere
with personal liberty any more than
other salutary laws of civilization.
You can do as you like only up to a
certain point. Your right to double
up your fist and swing your good right
arm about stops just before you come
in contact with your neighbor's nose.
You have no right to eat or drink any
thing which makes you. a nuisance, a
menace to society or a public charge.
A feature of the meeting was the
solo' work of Miss Vera Mullins who
sings campaign songs to the delight
of her hearers.
LARGER ST. JOIIXSHURY HOUSE
Preliminary Plans Call For An Ex

Wide.
Architect Burgess has completed
the preliminary plans for the propos
ed extension to the St. Johnsbury
House. These plans will be submitted

about the course to pursue. A draw

Mr. Burgess' plans call for an ex
penditure of about $25,000 for an ex
tension 109 feet long running back
parallel with Central street and 38

the present building will be the din
ing room 56 by 22 feet. This will be
only one story high and come out
flush with the present northern wall
of the hotel and will be lighted at
each end: The present dining room
would be used for a private dining
room and opened into the main din
ing room if necessary for banquets
and large gatherings. The rest of the
addition will stand several feet back
from the street and contain the
kitchen and such rooms on the first
floor.
The three floors above will be di

Mrs. II. M. Pearl, Mrs. Margaret N.
