er Provence in the Mediterranean.
With the lessening of the activity of
the contending armies to the north
of Verdun, the French in the Woevro
region, east of Verdun, are using their
artillery to break up German prepar
ation for further advances toward the
fortress. At various points the force
' ,, of the French guns has prevented the
Germans from launching offensives.
In the Vosges Mountains there has
also been great artillery activity by
the French near Senones and Ban de
Sapt, while near Seppois the Germans
have been driven out of trenches they
had previously taken. In the Cham
pagne German fortified works in the
region of Hill 193 have been battered
by the French guns and the crator of
a mine exploded by the Germans was
occupied by the French.
The Germans have added several ad
ditional points to their terrain in the
fighting about Verdun, having been
enahled to construct trenches on the
scopes north of the Cote du Poivre and
to capture an armored work northwest
of Douaumont and have taken the
towns of Manhulles and Champion,
thirteen miles southeast of Verdun.
In this drive east of Verdun the ad
vance of the Germans has extended
over a front of virtually twelve miles
from Dippe to Champion.

tions Teutonic naval commanders are
authorized to sink without warnin all
armed enemy merchantmen, they en
counter it is understood they have
been told to make sure, If possible, that
no American citizens are aboard any
sh!p attacked. Furthermore in the
latest communication regarding sub
marine warfare, Germany has assured
the United States that the new orders
are so formulated as to prevent the
destruction of enemy liners "on ac
count of their armament unless such
armament is proved."
The attitude of the United States
government toward the new policy of
Germany and Austria has not been
definitely, determined.
President Wilson discussed the sub
ject In conference with Secretary
Lansing and then laid the German
communication before his cabinet.

important appendices to the German
memorandum had been delayed In
transit the state department thus far
was unable to determine whether

In a lengthy statement in reply to
an official communication issued from
Constantinople, the Russian general
staff describes the powerful defenses
which guarded Erzerum and declares
that the force of the blow dealt by the
Russians can be estimated by the fact
that some of the Turkish army corps

taken prisoners.
Details are lacking concerning the
disaster to the French auxiliary cruis

made of the casualties.
MAYOR THOMPSON WORSTED
IN CHICAGO PRIMARIES.
In Six of the Nine Wards Which Re
volted Against Him.
..Chicago, Feb. 29. Six of the nine
wards the aldermen of which revolted
against Mayer William Hale Thomp
son, republican, nominated anti-
Thompson aldermanic candidates at
the primaries today. The mayor's
candidates were returned in the third,
thirteenth and thirty-third wards.
Women as well as men voted. In
afl the nineteen wards of the city's
thirty-five put up anti-Thompson
tickets, but the fight centered in nine
of these and mose severe in the
seventh, in which is situated the Uni
versity of Chicago. Years ago Charles
E. Merrlman of the faculty of that
school came into the city council as a
leader of the so-called reform element.
Mayor Thompson's fiercest assault
was made against John Kimball, the
Merriam candidate, but he was nom
inated 5,472 against 6,314 for Fred
erick W. Krengel, the Thompson man.
In the first ward which includes the
downtown district, the republican con
test produced a woman candidate, Hil
da Johnson Haskins. Of the female
vote she received 36 against 107 for
William H. Shrader. The deroocrtc
following immemorial custom renom
inated John Coughlin, known in form
er years as B"ath House John."
In the seventh Merriam's victory was
due to the women.

military pensions the government is
now paying amount to 1,500,000 an

in the house of lords today by Baron
Newton, who said it was calculated
that the amount could eaeily rise to
7.500,000 if the war lasted until the
end of March, 1917.
About one-thdrd of the men dis
charged were not pensioned, Baron
Newton continued, but if all of them
were pensioned the annual charge
would now be 2,500,000, and probably
would rise to over 11,000,000 by the
end of March, 1917.

Details of Sinking
of Steamer Maioja
TOLD BY RALPH FOSTER OF
KANSAS, A SURVIVOR
AFLOAT IN ICY WATER
Ship Sank so Quickly That Little
Could be Acommplished to Save
Those Aboard Impressed by Brave
ry of Women and Whits Members of
Crew.
London, Feb. 29, 5.50 p. m. That
German submarines have been sow
ing mines otf Dover was the belief ex
pressed today by Raiph Foster of
Kansas and other survivors of the
LUuloja disaster. Including some of
the officers of the ship. The fact that
a number of disasters have occurred
in the neighborhood of Dover during
the past two Sundays is considered in
some quarters in London as possible
evidence that German submarines,
knowing that a number of boats clear
fDr foreign ports Saturdays, have
taken advantage of that fact to cretp
in as near the coast as possible In tha
ni&ht time and discharge cargoes of
explosives.
Lifeboats Very Useless
In the opinion of Mr. Foster life
boats are very useless where vessels
strike mines, as the ships almost in
variably sink quickly and because the
crews are insutricientiy drilled tor
quick action and the boats mumot bo
lowered when a ship heels over on
her side as the Maioja did. Mr. Fos
ter had a thrilling experience. He
was afloat in the icy water and on
upturned boats an hour before he
was rescued by a. trawler.
Concussion Was Slight.
"I was promenading the deck well
forward about 10.20 o'clock Sunday
morning," said Mr. Foster today to
the Associated Press, "when I heard
a slight report. 1 thought it was a
gun tiring a blank shot until I saw
debris falling. Even then the concus
sion had been so slight that I con
cluded an accident must have hap
pened to some other ship nearby.
Ship Began to List Immediately.
"I rushed back immediately toward
the stern of the Maioja, but before 1
had taken a dozen steps the ship be
gan to list and I started toward the
life boat that had been allotted to my
cabin. It was so full of people, most
of them Lascars, that I saw it was.
likely to be swamped, so I went below
tor a lire belt. I put on my overcoat
and the lifebelt and also took my
passport.
Could Not Get Boat Clear.
"By this time hardly three min
utes after the explosion the passage
ways below were awash. I returned
to the life boat and tried to help
shove it clear. Two of the white crew
of the steamer were standing by to
lower the boat, but only a steward
and myself were making any efforts
to push It off from tho ship's side. We
could not get the boat clear of the
railing on account of tho heavy list
of the Maioja.
Many Slid Into Water.
"Everybody then piled out of the
lifeboat. Most of them slid across the
deck and into the water on the other
side. The deck was inclined to such
a degree that we could not stand. I
grabbed at an oar and slid down the
deck into the water. The waves were
so strong that I found I could not
swim In them and was washed back
against the side of the ship.
Crawled on to Capsized Boat.
"Finally I managed to reach a cap
sized boat a few feet away and
crawled onto it. From there I couid
see in the water near me several bod
ies of people who were bleeding about
the head. One Lascar was being
ground between a lifeboat and the
ship's side. A big swell washed mo
off my insecure perch. I knew what
would happen to me if I stayed on the
side of the sh'.p I was on, so I man
aged to get to the other side and
clung to the railing until only the
davits were projecting out of the wa
ter. Taken Off by Boat from Destroyer.
"I then pushed away from the
steamer and swam a few feet to a
boat which had five or six Lascars in
it. When I looked around the last of
the davits of the Maioja had disap
peared. We had no oars and the
waves kept breaking over the boat.
When it began to sink we swam to
another capsized boat and clung there
until a boat from a destroyer took us
off.
"When we came alongside the dk
stroyer I noticed that the swells seem
ed to boost up and down ten or 12
feet. I looked at the clock on board
the destroyer and saw it was 11.31
o'clock.
Little Terror Shown.
"The only terror or excitement
shown aboard the Maioja while they
were trying to lower the boats was
on the part of Lascars and some chil
dren who had become separated from
their mothers.
"One child who wa3 on deck near
the point of the explosion was blown
to pieces, an officer told me.
"One thing which made an Impres
sion on my mind while 1 was clinging
to a capsized boat was a 'Teddy bear'
which was floating a.bout. The cox
swain of the boat which picked us up
rescued the toy, saying 'I must have
that for my kid.' "
Deeply Impressed by Bravery of
Women.
Mr. Foster said he also was deeply
Impressed by the bravery of the
women and the white crew of the
Maioja. but not by her Lascar crew.
