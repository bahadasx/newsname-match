My Dear Mr. Pou: Inasmuch as I learn

I take the liberty of calling your atten

country which can. I believe. be handled,

New U-Boat W
U. S. Undecii
With the new Austro-German subma
rine campaign scheduled to start last
midnight, President Wilson and Secretary
of State Lansing are still undecided as
to the definite course which this govern
ment will adopt.
The decision awaits the arrival in
Washington of the alleged secret orders
of the British admiralty which Germany
and Austria have cited in Justification of
their intention to torpedo armed~ anemy
merchantmen wthout warning.
Coptes of these orders were given to
Ambassador Gerard at Berlin three weeks
ago by the German foreign offee as ap
pendices to the German declaration ad
vising neutral powers of the new sub
marine campaign. The Cabinet at its
meeting yesterday, after an hour's con
ference between the President and See
retary Lansing. agreed that It is impera
tive that these appendices should be in
hand at the earliest possible time.
For that reason Secretary Lansing. fol
losing the Cabinet session, cabled Am
bassador Gerard asking for exact in
formation as to when the diplomatic mail
pouch containing the data left Berlin.
CIlicials of the State Department insist,
however, that they take no stock in the
report that the pouch containing this
matte, was taken from the Dutch
steamer Nieuw Amsterdam by the British
censors at Falmouth.
In the meantime the American gov
ernment is awaiting with anxiety for
a practical demonstration of how the
new submarine campaign is to be car
ried on in the light of the memoran
d1um laid before Secretary Lansing on
Monday by Count von Bernstorff. Of
ficials are uncertain as to the practi
cal meaning of the statement con
tained in the memorandum that ene
my merchantmnen will not ,be sunk
without warning' nless the -presence
of armament on board such vessels
"Is proved."
What purported to be the official
text of the memorandum was pub
lished here yesterday afternoon. When
it was shown to Secretary Lansing he
refused to verify it. The German
Embeay likewise declined to confirm
or deny its authemticity. It read as
follows:
"The imperial government reitepstes
the pledges given on September f~nd

Reasons for Challenge.
In throwing down the challenge to Con
areas President Wilson was actuated by
the follon ing considerations:
1. Believing that a test of strength on
this issue was inevitable sooner or later
the President selected the present as the
most opportune time. ie apparently felt
that the administration's strength in
Congress on this issue would he greater
now than on the verge of a possible
crisis.
'. Charged with the responsibility of
tihe conduct of foreign affairs the Presi
dent desired an immediate decision as to
whether he was to tbe left with a free
hand in this matter or whether his ef
forts were to be handicapped by further
interference on the part of Congress.
The President decided that an imme
diate challenge wan the only way to end
the Impression which the Berlin authori
ties have obtgied tt hec
bmrt of 'the counatitiyk
submarine negotiations.
To say that President Wvilson's letta
to Acting Chairman Pou, of the House
Rules Committee. was a shock to the
Congress leaders is putting it mildly.
ILast night both those who are oppos
ing and those who are supporting the
administration were in consternation, and
were unable to say what course would
be followed.
ar Starts with
ied as to Action
tiations conducted between the Amer
can and German governments con
cerning the Lusitania incident never
referred to armed merchantmen.
"On the contrats. the note of the
American government of May 13 spoka
expressly of 'armed merchantmen.'
Furthermore, the formula agreed upon
by both governments on September 1
contained the proviso. 'provided that
they do not offer resistance.'
"The presence of armument on b'oard
a merchantman creates the presumption
that the vessel intends 'to offer resist
ance.' A submarine commander cannot
possibly warn an enemy liner, If the'liner
has the right to fire upon the submarine.
It is obvious that such resistance to the
warning by a submarine cannot be the
meaning of 'armed for defensive pur
Poses.' even if It were universally recog
nized that defensive armament Is per
mitted by international law.
"This point of view was adopted by
the American government when it re
quested assurances from the Italian Am.
bassador that the armed Italian Verdi
Verona, which entered the port of New
York. would not lire on submarines when
Warned by them.
"The imperial government issued its
new orders to the German naval com
manders after having seen by the secret
orders of the British admiralty that the
armament of British merchantmeo is to
be used for the purpose of attack, and
that these ships are not merely peace
ful traders 'armed only for defense.'
British merchantmen have furthermore
on several occasions attacked German or
Aqstro-Hungarian submarines.
"They do. therefore, not conform with
the assurances given by the British
government in the note of the British
Ambassador in Washington of August 23.
1914. and can even, according to the legsl
point of view adopted by the American
government, not he recognized as peace
ful traders.
"In issuing the new orders to its naval
commanders, the imperial government
believed,- itself to he entirely in aecord
with the American government, which
expressed similar Opinions in the pr-opos
als which it submitted to the entente
powers. The orders issued to the Ge
man naval commanders are so formu
tated that enemy liners may hot be de
stroyed on aceount of their armnamenst
unless such armament is proved. It is
therefore obvious that the imperial gov
ernment does not intend to revoke the
pledges given September 1 and October

LKELY TO KILL
BORLANO RIDER

Amendment Involves.New
Legislation on Measure.
CONTRARY TO RULES
Decision Hinges on Whether
Plan Would Reduce Forces
or Salaries.
JUDGE CRISP WILL DECIDE
Must Be Proved That Retrenchment
in Expenditures Necessarily
Would Be Result.
Ry JOSEPH P. ANNIN.
A careful study of House rules and
precedents by expert parliamentarians
yesterday narrowed considerably the
chances that the Borland rider on the
legislative bill. proposing a workday In
excess of eight hours, will stand the test
of a point of order.
In the face of the strong fire of oppo.
sition which has been turned on the pro
posal, it is not at all clear that its orig
Inal proponents seriously would object to
the efiloroforming of the rider by such
process. However, even in the face of
an insistent demand that the rider re
main in the bill, it is doubtful' If the
hair will overrule a point of order made
against it.
T.le point of order will be made prob
ably by Representative Mondell. of Wyo
ining, that the rider involves new legis
lation on an appropriation bill. contrary
to the rules of the loij. It r.ill be de
fended on the gro nds that it com-s un
der the Holman rule whih permits new
legislation on an appropriation hill under
certain conditions.
When the question finally boils down.
it will hinge almost entirely upon the
judgment of the presiding officer. Rep
resentative Crisp. of Georgia. whether
the Borland rider might necessarily be
expected. if enacted into law, to result
in ' "reduction of the number and sa
If One Seeton A itles.
As the Appropriations Committee is not
a legislative committee, and as the sub
ject matter of the Borland rider never has
been considered by a competent legisla
tive committee. only one section of the
Holman rule Is applicable. It reads:
* * * Nor shall any provision in any
such (general appropriationi bill or
amendment thereto changing existing law
be in order, except such as, being ger
mane to the subject matter of the bill,
shall retrench expenditurey
ta by the reduction of the number
and salarv of the officers of the United
States;
(b) by the reduction of the ompen
sation of any person paid out of the
Treasury of the United States, or
(c) by the reduction of the amounts
of money covered by the bill.
The rider has no direct bearing upon
the compensation paid any person. there
fore 4t cannot hope to mert requirement
(b).
As it was not proposed until all amounts
carried in the bill had been determined
upon, and approved by the fill committee.
it naturally cannot claim to have any
effect whatsoever upon amounts carried
in the bill as required by (e.
The question therefore boils down to re
quirement (a), and it must be determined
whether the effect of the provision will
be to reduce the number of officers of
the United States government.
Representative Borland claims that this
will be the effect.

of Verdun is that we must
ceaselessly watch and work,
never imagining that neither
side will pierce the defense lines
nor that trench war is eternal.
The price the Germans are
paying for the capture of Ver

ism and grandeur of France's
soldiers.
But let us hear no more about
Verduni being of no military
importance, nor that if the
Germans should succeed, the
general line of our front would
not be much changed. Verdui
is the key to the heights of
