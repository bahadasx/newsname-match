Better Safe Than Sorry
PRESIDENT CALLS
FOR "SHOW-DOWN"
FROM CONGRESS
Finds That He Cannot Act in Submar
ine Situation Until Position is
Strengthened.
CONFERENCE BEING HELD
WITH MEMBERS TODAT
Wilson Makes It Plain That It is He
Who is Held for Foreign
Policy.
Washington, March 1.President
Wilson decided yesterday that he
could not proceed with the German
submarine negotiations while dissen
sion in congress weakens his position
before the world, so he called for a
"showdown" on the pending propos
als to warn Americans off merchant
ships of European belligerents, arm
ed for defense.
Making clear that he considers the
president and not congress is charged
with the conduct of the foreign rela
tions of the United States, he wrote
a letter to Representative Pou, act
ing chairman of the house rules com
mittee, asking him to provide parlia
mentary means for bringing the agi
tation out into the open on the floor
of the house for full discussion and
a vote
Called to Conference.
Later, he summoned Senator Stone
and Representative Flood, chairman
of the foreign affairs committees, and
Senator Kern, majority leader in the
senate, for a conference at the White
House late today, at which he will
request that one of the pending reso
lutions be acted upon in both houses.
Administration leaders working
steadily for the last week strength
ening their lines and counting on the
support of the Republicans, now are
so sure of their position that they
plan to end all agitation with a vote
of confidence in the president.
This course was decided upon after
yesterday's cabinet meeting at which
it was discussed and after a week's
quite steady work at the capitol.
Want Prompt Action?
Prompt action is desired, particul
arly in the house, where agitation
has been most turbulent and where
Speaker Clark predicted auto-admin
istration resolutions when first in
troduced would have passed by a ma
jority of two to one. There never has
been any question of the administra
tion's control on the senate side.
Adoption of the pending resolution
would practically amount to congres
sional repudiation of -policies an
nounced and contended for by Presi
dent Wilson and Secretary Lansing
all through the submarine negotia
tions which more than once were in
a crisis.
Can Follow Course.
With their defeat and an affirma
tion by a majority of congress of
their confidence in the president's
course, Mr. Wilson's supporters point
out he will be enabled to continue to
contend for the principles of inter
national law and humanity with a
united government behind him and
with the same force as he did before
a minority in congress weakened his
position more than all arguments of
the foreign diplomats with whom he
had to contend.
Have Drawn Picture.
Dispatches from Berlin and Vienna
have pictured how the congressional
agitation was received there as indi
cating that the president in his de
mands upon Germany and Austria did
not have the support of his own party
and was being opposed by elected rep
resentatives of the people.
Came as Surprise.
News of the president's decision
came as a distinct surprise at the cap
itol, where the leaders of both houses
heard of it first through reports of
the letter received by Mr. Pou. There
were some expressions of dissatisfac
tion, particularly among members of
the house at the course adopted.
J. K. Given left last night for the
Twin Cities where he will spend a
short time on business affairs.

JAPAN WILL KEEP
PEACE IN ORIENT,
DECLARES OKUMA
Tokio, March 1.Count Okuma,
the Japanese premier, today told a
delegation of Japanese who are
avowedly hostile to Yuan Shi-Kai,
the Chinese president, that, while he
could not disclose the government's
policy with regard to China, they
might rest assured that Japan would
take proper measures to maintain
peace in the Orient. He added that
relations between Japan and Great
Britain as far as Chinese questions
are concerned, have improved and
that Great Britain shows confidence
in Japan's good faith.
The delegation which visited Count
Okuma was from a meeting of 300
Japanese politicians, including a doz
en members of parliament. One of
the resolutions passed by the meet
ing demanded that Yuan Shi-Kai re
sign and denounced him as responsi
ble for the revolution in Southern
China, which the resolution declared
to be justifable in view of Yuan's at
tempts to make himself a monarch.
REVOLUTION IN
NICARAGUA PLOTTED
New Orleans, March 1.A version
of the rumored plot of a Nicaraguan
revolution in circulation in Latin
American headquarters here today
was that arms and ammunition to
supply an army of 30,000 already
have been assembled on Nicaragua's
borders and that operations were to
begin early in March.
The plan, according to the story,
was fomented here by followers of
Rodolfo Espinoza, liberal candidate
for the Nicaraguan presidency, and
backed by New York interests. No
confirmation came from any source.

FORTY CENTS PEE MONTE
AEROPLANEPASSES
OVER BEMIDJI EN-I
ROUTE TO WEST
John and Henry Rowe Claim to Have
Seen Aircraft Tuesday
Night.
TRAVELING AT HIGH RATE OF SPEED
May Be Same Craft as Has Been Seen
Near Duluth Flight is a
Mystery.
That an aeroplane passed over Be
midji Tuesday evening enroute west
is the opinion of John and Henry
Rowe who claim to have watched the
craft. It is believed that the air
craft is the same that has been seen
over Duluth and Superior during the
past few days. Just why it was
headed toward the west is not known.
The craft was traveling at a very
high rate of speed.
Seen at 9:30 P. M.
"It was shortly after 9:30 o'clock
Tuesday night," said John Rowe to
a Pioneer representative, "while I
was returning from the firemen's
meeting with my father that I no
ticed two lights in the sky traveling
very fast toward the west. We stop
ped and watched the lights which
remained the same distance apart and
came to the conclusion that it was
an aeroplane. We could not hear the
working of the machinery. We
watched the lights until they dis
appeared in the west. The craft ap
peared to be coming from the east,
probably from Duluth, and was head
ed toward Grand Forks and the west.
"I believe that it is the same craft
that has been seen around Duluth."
Mr. Rowe is connected with 'the
Standard Oil company in Bemidji.
