Poor Topeka with her inability to

Albert, international Rotary president.

Then to stir pride in Topeka's heart
and make her ashamed of herself this
extraordinary man pictured the beau

Three features of modern American
cities were brought out prominently
by Presiden Albert.
First, the government of modern
American cities is honest and general
ly efficient. There are exceptions but
these are known.
Second, the modern American city
is spending more money tha.. in any
age on three projects, recreation, edu
cation and introduction of beauty into

Third, these are products of a great
spiritual awakening in the lives o fthe
people themselves in every section of
America.

Mrs. Harrison's Girl Chum Told
Police of Murder.
Warren Slain on Auto Trip
With 15-Year-Old Bride.
Fort Worth, Texas, March 1. "I
don't want to see an innocent man
suffer."
That was the first explanation of
fered by pretty-lS-year-old Louise
Guigon, chum of Mrs. Katherine
Vance Harrison, for telling the police
about the shooting of W. L. Warren
on December 22.
The girl bride's confession was not
! a voluntary one. She kept her secret
j locked in her own breast until she was
charged with having shot the man.
iThen came the news that her closest
friend had given the clue which en
abled the police to solve a two
months' old mystery.
"There are other reasons why I told
the secret," said Miss Guigon tonigut.
She seemed in an unhappy frame of
mind. Her manner suggested that she
would like to tell the other reasons,
but felt herself in honor withheld.
"These reasons will sooner or later
be brought out," she continued. "No
one but the officers knows what, they
are. That's all I'm going to say."
Others Were In Party.
One other fact, and that an import
ant one, was gleaned from the in
terview. It was that Charles Harrison,
his fiancee, Katherine Vance and
Warren, the murdered man, were not
the sole occupants of the automobile,
where she shot Warren.
"It's nobody's business," she retort
ed. "There are other good reasons,
but I won't tell them."
A fourth person who held the key
to the mystery was Mrs. Sterling
Richardson, wife of the pastor of the
Weatherford Street Methodist church.
The tragedy has had the conse
quence of removing the obstacles to
the complete happiness of Katherine J
and Charles Hurrison. which had ex
isted since their wedding. The bride's
family is poor. Both che Vance and
Harrisons opposed the marrtajce.
Married on an Klonement.
So, following their elopement to
Dallas two days after the killing,
Katherine obtained employment as a
stenographer. Last night, however,
shii was in the house of her father-in-law,
freely accepted as a member of
his famiiy.
There is a Texas statute forbidding
the trial of a minor for murder. If
Mrs. Harrison were convicted, there
fore, the reform school is the only
nvai!altle place of detention. Bit the
fact, that she is married ompticatts
tn situation.
The T( 3as laws bold homie'd-s ius
tif iablo in self-defense or in protect
ing one against a burglar. Public
opinion here is that Mrs. Harrison
was justified in killing the man who
robbed her of her honor, the jame
as would be a man who shot a burglar

March Is I'shered in With Rain. Sleet
and Low Temperature.
March came in dark and gloomy,
with the ground coated with a film of
ice and a temperature only a few de
Krpos below freezing. Some real "lion
like" weather is predicted for the sec
ond day of the month. High winds,

expected to be blowing at a high rate
tonight. The Kaw river continues its
slow descent, the stage this morning

Snow tonight and Thursday ; with
colder weather tonight and fresh
northerly winds tonight is the forecast.
The wind will probably make 2 5
miles an hour. A temperature of be
tween 3 5 and 20 degrees is expected
at Topeka. The shippers' forecast
warns against temperatures of 10 to
15 degrees for 36-hour shipments
north and west; east and south, 20 de
grees. The lowest temperature this morn
ing was 2S degrees at 7 and 8 o'clock.
Very little variation in the readings
was expected today. The rain which
fell this morning was not heavy
enough to measure, but it covered
everything with a thin coating of ice.
The wind this morning was only blow
ing at the rate of 5 milts an hour.
On this date in 1901 the mercury

Germany Won't Promise to
Stand Pat on Assertions.
Washington. March 1. House
leaders today drafted for consid
eration of tiic house a measure,
proposing that congress express
its confidence in the president's
handling of the armed merchant
men controversy and recognize
that it is not a matter of legisla
tive but executive concern.
Washington, March 1. Germany's
latest assurances on the conduct of
submarine warfare presented Monday
by von Bernstorff to Secretary Lans
ing are not so broad as the United
States desires, but it is indicated no
further steps will be taken by this
government until the administration is
certain its action will not embarrass
congress.
The assurances reiterated in the la
test communication are regarded as
j not so complete as those originally
' given as the result of the Lusitanla
i negotiations and it was indicated to
! day that the pending Lusitania agree
! ment would not be finally accepted as
! satisfactory at this time.
Officials were reported as feeling
j that if the German government took
I the position that it could modify or
' change the first assurances at will.
I there was nothing to prevent an at
' tempt to change the latest assurances
and they do not intend to agree with
t such procedure.
It was said that the next step would
be taken as soon as the situation in
! congress was clarified. Officials ex
pect the administration will tind it
self in a position to continue the ne
gotiations within the next tew days.
Chairman Flood of the foreign af
fairs committee sought to bring Dem
ocrats in line on the measure to be re
ported out of his committee and also
sought ineffectually to get assurances
of Republican co-operation.
Wilson Against Resolution?
-J
The president positively did no
ask for such a resolution." said Mr.
Flood, speaking of the new proposal.
"This form has Ween broached since
I returned from the White House con
ference." Pending the sounding of sentiment
on the resolution the meeting of the
foreign affairs committee was post
poned from one o'clock to an indefi
nite hour. Meantime leaders con
ferred on the new proposal. It was
argued by some that this would re
lieve the house of going on record on
the armed ship proposition. Predic
tions that the president would not en
dorse the proposed resolution were
freely expressed.

RAID LAW BEGAN AT MIDNIGHT
Censored Report Doesn't Tell
Hon Many Victims.
Thornaby Torpedoed, Probably
in Mediterranean.
London, March 1. The British
steamship Thornaby is reported to
have been sunk, all the members of
the crew having been killed or drown
ed. This ship is believed to be victim
No. 1 of the drastic U-boat raid law
inaugurated by Germany to go into
effect last midnight.
The Thornaby was owned in We9t
Hartlepool, England. She was built
in 1889 and was 25S feet long.
The vessel sailed on January It
from Sunderland. England, for Paler
mo, Sicily. The ship undoubtedly was
almost to its destination so the dis
aster mus have taken place in the
Mediterranean sea, although the cen
sored report of the war office doe? not
designate where it was sunk.
Although the British censorship
prevents transmission of details con
cerning the reported sinking of the
Thornaby, the reference that the
members of the crew have been killed
or drowned indicates sl.e was sunk by
a mine or torpedo. The Germans and
Austrian decrees regarding the sink
ing of armed merchantmen without
warning went into effect at midnight.
The Thornaby is the first vessel
whose sinking has oeen reported since
the order became operative, but the
London dispatch does not indicate
. whether she was armed or whether
she was sunk before or after the open
ing of the month.
