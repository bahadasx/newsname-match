Although the British -censorship prevents transmission .of
details concerning the reported sinking of the Thornaby, the
reference to members of the crew "having probably been killed
or drowned indicates she was sunk by a mine or a torpedo.
The German and Austrian decrees regarding the sinking of
. armed merchantmen without warning went into effect ml inid
night. The Thornaby is 'the first vessel whose sinking has
been reported since the orders became operative but the Lon

Ambassador Gerard, at Berlin asking
by what ship -fcle appendices to the
German memorandum notifying- this
governneit that armed -vessels would
be sunk without warning beginning
- March 1, had been dispatched., and
when they might be expected to arrive
here. ,. , . -
The appendices are said - to . reveal
the existence of ftecret orders of the

One Of the most disastrous fires In
this city in many years was narrowly
averted shortly after .1 o'clock this
, morning when a check was put to the
flames that threatened fo destroy
Eagles' hall in Madison avenue. The
blaze had a good start. The loss is
estimatedi at about $10,000 or $15,000.
The building is covered with an in
surance of $17,600. . .S
An Association composed of Inspec
tors in the Remington Arms & Am
munition company held its first an-
, nual dance in the hall last evening.
The - dance concluded at 12:15 and
. Secretary Thomas J. McNamara and
Janitor Joseph Cummings inspected
the interior of the building but found
no cigar butts or any ottaer material
that might cause a fire. It was 12:30
when they left the building.
Policeman Patrick Boland discov
ered smoke issuing from the rear of
, Eagles', hall as he was passing the
building about 1 o'clock. He ran to
SJo. 4 Engine house and that com
pany responded to a still alarm. Capt.
Thomas Burns saw the necessity of
sending in a. regular alarm, which he
-did. Engine Company 1 and 5 and

alarm. '- , V ":N
By this 'time the rear - of the hall

HAINES PROMPTS
LAWYERS IN HIS
FIGHTJOR LIFE
Witnesses Testify That
Bridgeport Policeman
Was First on Scene.
NEIGHBOR TELLS OF
, GRUESOME SCENES
Counsel Not "Yet Ready To
Say Whether Accused
Will Take Stand.
Interest today in the Haines mur
der trialf centtered in the awakening
attitude of the prisoner charged with
killing his wife; who for the first time
during- the course of trial attempted
to prompt his .attorneys in the con
duct of examinations.
Jasn Haines, while closely atten-'
tive to all that ihas been said, has
heretofore remained almost sphynx
like in his posture before the court.
Iuring "the testimony of his neigh
bor and long acquaintance, William
B. Waller. Haines reached for a pad
and pencil, was about to wrilte a note
and then changing his mind, twitched
at -Che sleeve of Judge R. E. DeFor
est, his attorney; whispering instruc
tions. ' , - '
The result of these instructions was
not apparent in the cross-examination
of Mr. Waller. ..-'.
Speculaition is rife about the cor
ridors of the court house today as
to whether Jason Haines will be plac
ed upon the witness stand in his own
behalf. ' Attorneys refused to dis
close what action they may take re
garding the defendant's testifying i
Several witnesses for It he state were
placed upon the stand today in. an
effort to show how many shots had
(been fired on the fatal day and to
identify guns as those used at the
.time , and subsequent to the crime. ;
One of the most sensaltional fea
tures of the morning's session was
testimony " introduced to show that
in addition to the bloody scene inside
the house an equally gruesome one
was . .disclosed ' without. , Two wit
nesses, Waller a-nd Howard , F. Ran
dall, - grand juror of Trumbull, told
of finding pieces of flesh and 'blood
upon the outside roof of !the house.
That Clifford N. Gorgas, motorcy
cle policeman of the Bridgeport force,
was the first officer on the scene of
the- crime, was admitted by the wit
ness today, who showed how the
young officer had armed those at the
scene ami prepared for the capture
of the slayer.
: . That Haines may have been at his
home on the Saturday night, follow
ing his arrest for assault and prior
to the Monday of the killing. Was
brought ' out in cross-examination o
Mr. Waller, who testified before the
coroner and admitted (today that he
believed he heard Haines' voice in a
carriage passing near the Waller
homestead on that night. j
Edward F. Rattigan, the first wit
ness today, testified as 'to Haines'
resentment of the placing of hand
cuffs on him when he was arrested
prier to the murder. , On Monday,
Rattigan says, Haines told his wife,
on his return from court, that she
could take her things and go. She
refused.
William E. Waller, the next neigh
bor of Haines, testified that he had
known Haines all his life. On the
Friday preceding the murder, he was
In a barn when he heard some one
call. He thought the call came from
the house north of his, but when he
came out of the barn he was told he
was wanted at the Haines home. He
saw Mrs.. Haines with Deputy Sheriff
Emil Berger in a carriage. ' They
wanted an automobile, but his was not
in condition to be used.
Waller testified that at the time
Mrs. Haines was covered with blood
"from head to foot."
When Waller went to the Haines
home, on this occasion, blood was
found in pools on the floor.
Coming to the day of the crime.
Waller said he was m the same barn,
with the door open, about 400 feet
distant from the Haines home. H3
heard continuous screams, very loud,
quickly followed by two gun shots,' as
ouick as they could be fired from a
double barrelled shot gun, he said.
The screaming immediately ceased.
Waller started for his own house and

AIM
President Has Series of
ers in Congress, Following Letter to Repre
sentative Pou Asking For Immediate Action
Speaker Clark Unable to Guage Sentiment in
House Now Little Delay is Expected to
Bringing Measure to Vote.
Washington, March 1 At a conference at the White House
today President Wilson and administration leaders discussed
plans for bringing the armed ship agitation in Congress to an
end at once with a demonstration of unity to convince Germany
that the American Congress stands behind the foreign policy
of the government.
President Wilson reiterated to the leaders that while dis
sensions in the American Congress over the question of warn
ing Americans not to travel on the armed ships of the' Euro
pean belligerents were being made "industrious use of in for
eign capitals," and being pictured as evidence that the country
does not support the Presiden tin his stand, for the observance
of the laws of nations and humanity, his -negotiations with Ger-.;
many are embarrassed and, in fact, cannot be continued-
Confident that they can beat all anti-Administration reso
lutions by a heavy vote, the President and the leaders framed
plans to bring them out first on the floor of the House, where
they plan to defeat them.
The President paved the way for his
action last might and incidentally sur
prised Congress by calling on Acting
Chairman Pou of the House Rules
committee, to provide the parliamen
tary machine for immediate consid
eration of the resolutions on the floor.
Inasmuch as the resolutions have been
held in the House foreign affairs
committee by main force of the ad
ministration leaders at the request of
the President, because of fears for the
results if they were allowed to come
out for a vote, the President's action,
taken without consultation with the
leaders, caused no little amazement.
At today's conference, however, to
which the -President summoned Chair
men Stone and 'Flood ot the Senate
and iHouse committees" dealing with
foreign affairs, and Senator Kern, the
Democratic floor leader, he explained
his purposes fully.
After the President, Senators Kern
and Stone and Representative Flood
had been in conference for an hour.
Speaker Clark and Majority Leader
Kitchin, of the House, were summon
ed to join the conference. An effort
was being made to decide on the form
of action Congress should take.
The conference agreed that in defer
ence to the wishes of President Wilson
a- vote would be takn en the near fu
ture in both' Senate and House on
resolutions warning Americans to
keep off the armed ships, but the
form in which the resolutions would
be presented would be determined
later. "
. Immediately after the conference.
Chairman Flood went to the capitol
and called his committee together to
frame a resolution.
. The President made it clear that he
did not want a vote on a resolution
expressing support of his cofiuct of
the diplomatic controversy and as a
result of his position the vote wui
be taken on a resolution . warning
Americans off armed ships. Admin
istration forces are sure they can.
beat it. 1
The President also discussed the
question with Acting Chairman Pou
of the rules committee, he President
asked that as soon as the House foreign-
affairs committee had prepared
its resolution the rules committee
bring in a rule for discussion and a
vote on the floor. '
At the conclusion of the conference
the leaders hurried back to the capi
tol. It was almost certain that the
parliamentary situation in both houses
would prevent a vote coming up today.
The President explained to " the
leaders that he had written to: the
rules committee jhh uwclu ho ww
dissatisfied with : any adtaom of the
foreign affairs committee 1ut because
he thought it expedient as he realized
that a special rule would be necessary
to provide for . immediate consid
eration. ' .
Chairman Flood said that after he
had drafted a resolution he would
confer' with Ithe President on its ex
act form before it was presented to
the House.
Speaker Clark and Majority Lead
er Kitohi-ni said no action could 'be
taken today in the House and that
the conference had been -devoted
chiefly j to discussing procedure.
'"The habit of obedience has been
developed to a high degree in Con
gress," was Mr. KUtichiin's answer to
a question about prospects of "a vote.
He is one of those who have favored
the resolutions. One plan discussed
was for the House foreign affairs com
mittee to report adversely one of the
pending resolutions and at the same
time have the rules commitjtee bring
in a rule limiting debate. By that
plan a vote .could foe reached in the
blouse tomorrow or Friday and the
question would be taken up in the
Senate Immediately afterward.
The President told Ithe leaders the
foreign, situation was no more seri
ous today tham it has been for sev
eral weeks but he believed action
should be taken quickly to show the
world that the American government
was not divided.
lJ t-i fr fj)
Conferences With Lead
Leader Kitchin said he did not
think the McLenmore resolution
would be the one offered by the for
eign affairs committee and Chairman
Flood said It was hds opinion that
none of the resolutions now in his
committee would -be chosen for the
test.
It was understood that some of the
leaders who conferred at the White
House -today still differed with the
President's position. Sp.iker Clnrk,
who predicted last week that a warn
ing resolution would pass two to one
at any time, said he did not know the
sentiment of the House now-and re
fused to say how he himself would
vote. f
The House foreign, affairs committee
got ready, for a meeting at 1 o'clock
at ' which it was the plan to canvass
the situation generally and refer the
drafting of the resolution to a sub
committee. . Despite- the President's
expressed desire that the vote commit
tee put a straight question of passage
of a warning resolution the sentiment
in' the t foreign affairs committee and
among administration leaders of both
sides of the capitol was hot clearly
defined. ; ,
House leaders ' today drafted for
consideration of the House measure
proposing- that Congress express its
confidence in the President's handling
of the armed merchantmen contro
versy and recognize that it is not a
matter of legislative but of executive
concern. '
