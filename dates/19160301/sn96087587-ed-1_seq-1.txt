T. Ryan has sold about 70
Plymouth Rock cockerels during
the late winter nt from $1 to $8
per head and has had a number
of orders that ho could not fill.
13. West thinks there is noth
ing like the siron song of the
White Leghorn: and well may
the think so, as his little flock has
I been registering around the 100
,mmk during the past ten oayu.
! If. P. Wettengrl thinkB that
variety is tnosnice of life, even
i) for a hen. Tho daily menu of
i I his flock consists of kafir. bran,
ti shorts, cotton seed meal, beef
i scraps, cooked potato peelings,
A' oyster shell, mico-sprr cubical
X grit, and charcoal, with an oe
T ' casional feed of ground flax seed.
4! H. E. Ogle, secretary of the
i countv association, writes that
he has had orders fo Brown Leg
I horn cockerels that ho has been
