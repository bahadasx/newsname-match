Borland Rider Likely
loBe Sidetracked By
International Crisis
President's Letter Strengthens Belief That Amend
ment May Go Over Opposition to It Growing
in the Meantime in the House.
It became probable today that the House will be unable to vote
until next week on the Borland amendment to the legislative ap
propriation bill which requires Government clerks here to work eight
hours a day. '
Fate, in the form of an international crisis and the President's
letter asking that Congress vote on his policy concerning the sub
marine controversy, apparently is about to play into the hands of tha
Government clerks.
Surfaco and under-surface indications are that the longer a vote
is postponed on the Borland rider, the more formidable becomes tho
opposition.
SIDETRACK DUE.
Tho Issue raised by the President's
unusual letter to one of the House
leaders is so serious that it is likely
that oil other business will bo side
tracked until tho lower body shall have
voted cither to uphold or reject the
President's contention that Americans
have n Kght to travel on armed mcr
chantmont of belligerents.
This situation. In all probability, will
hold up the legislative, exccutlvo and
judicial appropriation bill for two or
moro days, and tho measure cannot bo
passed before the middle of next week.
Such a situation augurs well for the
Government c.ipi wr The i po tln
to the Borland rider, hastily considered

steadily growing. This was evidenced
during a preliminary skirmish yester

by Chairman Flood, expressing the
conpdence of Congress in the
President's ability to handle the
international situation.
SHOWN TO LEADERS.
ThU resolution was prepared shortly
after 1 o'clock ttvday and shown to
ifouse leaders and Democratic mem
bers of the Foreign Affairs Committee,
The preparation of such n. resolution
Is not understood, in eevoral auartcra
of the House where the Jmprcsclon was
gained tho President did not wnnt tha
vote of confidence, but desired a voto
on the principle involved the right f
Americans to travel on armed mer
chantmen. A member of the Foreign Affairs
Committee said there was no assurance
regarding the form of resolution that
ultimately will bo reported.
It la understood the White Houso will
bo cnsulted again before final action is
taken.
Notwithstanding the fact that the
President conferred today with Senate
and House leaders, no one In Congress
seemed able to state with certainty what
the Exccutlvo desires.
That the entire situation la one of
unparalleled gravity waa generally ad
mitted by Republicans and Democrats.
Saveral Plans Ready.
' It was authoritatively said today
thoro are at least a half dozon different
resolutions In the pockets of various
leaders In Congress bearing on the
muddled situation.
When he Foreign Affairs Commit
tee mesta. It Is practically sure to be
confronted by two resolutions, one
simply expressing tho faith of Con
gress In the President: the othor ex
pressing that faith, but embodying 'a.
statemont that Americans should stay
off of armed ships.
Not within the memory of the oldest
member of the Hduse has there been
so. much excitement about the corri
dors and cloakrooms as that ex
hibited today. The only exceptions
noted were the scenes Incident to the
declaration of war against Spain.
That the situation Is fraught with
potentialities of International and do
mestlo ramifications added to the ex-4
cuement. . .
Democrats realized that nnt'ai
