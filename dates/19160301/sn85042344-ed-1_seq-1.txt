LETTER DEMANDING SHOWDOWN
"My Dour .Mr. I'oii: Iiinsiniicli as I leiiru tlittt Mr.
Henry, the cliiiinnan of t lit- cotmii it tec mi rules, is absent
iu Texas, I take the liberty of eullinj: your attention as
ranking tneiiilier of the committee to a matter of gravo
concern to the country which can. I believe, be handled
under the rules of the house only by that committee.
"The report that there are divided counsels in congress
in regard to the foeiign policy of the government is being
made industrious use of in foreign capitals. 1 believe that
report to be false but so long as it is anywhere credited,
it cannot fail to do the greatest harm and expose the coun
try to the most serious risks. I therefore feel justified in
asking that your committee will permit me to urge an
early vote upon the resolutions with regard to travel on
armed merchantmen which have recently been so much
talked about, iu order that there may be afforded an im
mediate opportunity for full public discussion and action
upon them and that all doubts and conjectures may lie
swept a way and our foreign relations once more cleared
of damaging misunderstandings. The matter is of so
grave importance and lies so clearly within the field of
executive initiative that I venture to hope that your com
mittee will not think that I am taking unwarranted lib
erty in making this suggestion as to the business of the
house and I very earnestly commend it to their immediate
consideration.
