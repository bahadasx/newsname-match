Makinff Pork at Four font* ?I r.???o?i? * * '
Pound
In a recent issue of the Roanoke-Chowan
Times Mr. D. H.
Brown tells how Messrs. F. P.
and C. J. Shields made pork at
less than four cents a pound on
the Halifax county farm:
"It may seem hard for some
people, who are inclined to be
skeptical anyway, to believe that
these men are able, every year,
to grow hundreds of hogs without
feeding them any, or very
t*A4t -
nine corn, mis is just what
they are doing, however. Below
is more of a detailed ac
count of how they are able to do
this.
"During the winter the pigs
are allowed to run on bur clover
and rye, in the spring they are
pastured on crimson clover and
rye; and during the early summer
on rape and soy beans, late
in the summer and early fall
they pasture on soy beans and
sweet potatoes and during the
late fall soy beans and peanuts

time they are ready to kill.
*'Last year they had a special
field fenced off as follows: The
field contained 75 acres. In
very early spring 10 acres were
sowed in rape. By the time the
pigs were done running on clov
er the rape was ready ior them.
Right next to the rape was a
20 acre field of soy beans, planted
about the middle of April. A
little later 20 more acres were
planted in soy beans. The next
10 acres were planted in sweet
potatoes. To finish out the 75
ttr>roa IK ?/>.?? *
avicd wcic |iui in peanuts.
In order to get the most
?^ ^outjpf soy beans, they begin to
pasture them about "~the"" middle
of July, by the time tlie blooms
appear. But they fence off a
small portion of them to put the
hogs on at first. They do not,
as a rule allow their hogs to run
on more than ten acres at a time.
By the time they have cleaned
up all the other beans, they put
them back on the first 10 acre
plot. In the meantime, they
have put out new sprouts and
U ? * * ?
nave iorraea nam beans. Except
when the hogs run on peanuts,
they all have rings in their
noses.
uThe day I was on the farm,
they were fencing off plots of
crimson clover. On this they
were going to put a fine lot of

two months old. They were indeed
a nice looking bunch ot
pigs. I told Mr. Shields so. He
said, 'You just wait 60 days and
see those pigs and you will not
know them. There is hardly
anything which starts off a pig
as well as clover.* Later he
thinks there is nothing quite
equal to soy beans for hogs.
Every pig, every stock hog and
every brood sow on the Shields
farm is vaccinated against i

Appealing to a lady for aid,
an old negro told her that
through the Dayton flood he had
lost everything he had in the |
world, including his wife and i
six children, according to The
Cincinnati Enquirer.
"Why," said the lady, "I have
seen you before, and I have helped

Concerning Lusitania Assurances.
Washington, Feb. 27.?Germany
has instructed Count von
Bernstorff to inform the United
.States Government that the assurances
regarding the future
conduct of submarine warfare,
given in the Lusitania and Arabic
cases, still are binding, but
that they apply only to merchantmen
of a peaceful character.
The German Government is
I lindprstrkTtri in r>nn?onH
ed merchantmen have without
regard to the nature of their
armament shown themselves
not to be peaceful and therefore
are subject to destruction without
warning.
The instructions direct the
German Ambassador particularly
to tell Secretary Lansing that
British merchantmen armed
ostensibly only for defense have
not assumed the character of
peaceful traders, but that on the
contrary they carry guns for the
special purpose of attacking
German submarines. To support
this claim the Berlin Foreign
Office has sent the Ambassador
for presentation to the
State Department a list of at
least 20 incidents where it is
claimed British merchant ships
have attacked submarines.
Confidential advices received
from Berlin state that German
and Austrian submarine commanders
already have been given
their new orders and that
fron) midnight Tuesday they
will be authorized to sink without
warning all armed merchant
ships of the enemies of Ger- 1
many. It was said also that 1
many of the submarine comman- !
ders probably had left their bkses '

should the United States request 1
the postponing of the opening 1
of the campaign, it would be '
impossible to get word to many 1
of the submarines. It was stat- '
ed, however, that so far neither !
the United States nor any other '
Nation had asked a postponement.

The story is told in The Indianapolis
News that there was a
bad accident in the street of a
big city. A surgeon happened
to be^at the spot and was soon
rendering first aid. He did not
have his medicine kit with him.
He needed something and need i
ed it uuicklv.
"Boy," he saul to a youngster
in the crowd, "hand me that 4
string out of your pocket." And 4
the string was forthcoming. (
' How did you know that boy 4
had a string in his pocket?" ask- ^
ed a spectator later.
"Why, every real boy carries *
strings in his pocket," said the 4
surgeon. I \
Laying Submarine Mines.
Popular Science Monthly.
The mines which have been
chiefly used in the present war
are automatic and mechanical,
and are fired when the ship
strikes against them.
Mines of this type are easily 1
laid. When stowed away on
the deck of a mine laying ship
the mine rests on the anchor
which at the same time forms a
little carriage which can be run
along the deck and simply dropped
over the stern of the ship.
Whether mines have actually
been laid by submarines is, of ;
course known only to the naval i
authorities. Patents have, however,
been taken out within the i
last few years for specially de- ,
signed mines to be laid by submarine
boats with a series of
chambers on each side for hold
ing and launching mines. These 1
chambers are disposed between i
double walls of the submarine i
and are made to form a smooth
outline with the hull of the boat. 1
A mine is maintained at the
desired depth in the water bv 1

means of an anchor in which 1
the cable, one end of which is
connected to the mine, is unwound
from a drum suitably
braked and mounted in the anchor
casing. The rotation of
the drum is controlled by a
plumb weight attached to a
short sounding line. When the
plumb weight reaches the bottom
of the sea the rotation of
the drum is stopped and the
mine is pulled down to the required
depth. It is only necessary
tp determine at wfcat depth 1

Verdun Battle's Fury Shows No
Signs Let-up
Dispatch of Monday.
The great battle raging around
Verdun in which a half-million
men are engaged is still being
fought at some points with the
same fury as characterized it
several days ago.
Champneuville. to the west,
and fortified works of Bardaumont,
to the east of Fort Douaumont,
have been captured by the
Germans. Berlin also claims to
have captured the Cotede Talou,
to the west of Douaumont, but
according to the French official
statement, the artillery fire coming
from both sides has rendered
this position untenable for
either French or Germans.
The French are hurling attack
after attack upon the Douaumont
positions held by the Germans,
who are declared to be
maintaining themselves there
with difficulty, but in the Woevre
region, to the east of Verdun,
[he French advanced posts have
been withdrawn.
Large reinforcements are being
brought up probably bv both
forces, and it is reported that the
i: " - -
di 111511 nues are Deing extended
in Belgium and Fiance in order
that French troops may be reeased
for the Verdun battle.
In the Vosges mountains the
Germans also started a heavy

Quit Using Fire
Wise and good old Dr. Knapp
used to say that fools and fire
are two of the most serious obstacles
to better farming in the
South, and a trip through the
Cotton Belt at this time of the
year will convince any clear
thinking man that he was right;.
Everywhere blue smoke curling
upward from burning corn
and cotton stalks, grass, weeds
and trash tells a story of soil de
pletion and exhaustion. We
have seen grass and stalks so
light and scattering that a hay
rake was necessary to gather
them in piles or windrows, where
they were burnt. This often
happens, too, ou our thin, gullied
hillsides that need vegetable
matter if any land in the
world needs it.
There's one thing we might
all as well get right now: We
are never going to have rich
lands and profitable yields as
long as such practices are kept
up. It's a pitiful thing to see a
farmer burning this material and
then buying high-priced commercial
fertilizers to make his
crop. It has been found that on
land that made 300 pounds of ;
lint cotton, the stalks, leaves and
burs contain at least 20 pounds
of nitrogen, worth at present
prices about $5. Where corn
stalks and grass are burned the
loss is little less. Nor is this the
only loss, for the humus value
nf this matorial Jo n :
?Mtvitai 10 a VC1 y lllipurtant
item.
If you ever expect to become
a rich-land farmer, keep fire out
of the fields. Burn absolutely
nothing that can be plowed un
der or used to Aton ?J
your Innd will soon respond
with bigger and better crops.?
Exchange.
What Stevenson Thinks about
Roads
The last statement made by
Mr. W. F. Slevenson as to what
Congress should do for a farm
ing district like this was that it
bad spent $475,000,000.00 on
rivers and nothing on roads. It
has also spent $100,000,000 ou ir
ngauon projecis, 10 water lands
for less than 1,000,000 people in
the West. Why not do some
thing to take the water out of
the roads in the South? In
South Carolina the State and
bounties and Towns and Town
ships spent in 1914 about $1,000,
)00.00 on roads, and still of the
15,549 miles of roads in the State
only 4,888 miles are surfaced
and really improved?and that
is the work of years. 40,661
miles are yet to be fixed, and all
must be maintained. The Government
carries mail over most
;>f them; why is it not right for
it to help fix them?

Germans Attack With Unprecedented
Violence
Dispatch published Saturday.
Along the front in tne region
of Verdun the Germans and the
French continue the great struggle
which began several days
ago with the Germans on the
I offensive and thoir aim
. _ ? >U?.>1 IU1U tViUClit*
Iv the great French fortress of
Verdun.
Notwithstanding a heavy fall
of snow the Germans to the
north of Verdun have attacked
with what Paris terms unprecedented
violence and with large
forces, French positions at several
points but according to the
French official communication
the attacks were without success.
Especially has this been true at
La Cote du Poivre, about four
and a half miles north of the
fortress, the attainment of which
would give the Germans a good
vantage point from which to
operate against Verdun.
The artillery on both sides
along the entire battle front is
keeping up fn incessant bombardment
of opposing positions.
So intense are the detonations of
the big guns that the sound of
them has penetrated eastward to
the left bank of the Rhine in
Rhenish Prussia.
Heavy casualties are being inflicted
by both sides and the Germans
claim that they have taken
many prisoners?the aggregate
at last reports to talling more
than 10,000.
