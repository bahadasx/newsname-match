Stone, chairman of the senate foreign
relations committee, stating that he
could not consent to the abridgment
of the rights el American citizens In
any respect.
"The honor and self-reeffeet of the
nation ie involved." he said. "Wo
covet peace and shall preserve it at
any cost but the loee of honor."
The president expressed hope, that
explanation of the declared Intention
of the central powere to sink aimed
fact chant shlpe without warning
would put a different aspect on a sit?
uation which now seemed to present
Insuperable obetaclea "We have

faith or their fidelity to their promisee
In the past.'' he added, "and I for one
feel confident that we shall have none
in the future."

Statement of the administration's
-ami fiSM mm
V The letter follows:
*j*#y Dear Senator:
'f\^l very warmly appreciate your?
ttmi and frank letter of today and feel
that It calls for an equally frank
?*You are right In assuming that I
shall da everything in my power to
keep the United States out of war. I
think the country will feel no un?
easiness about my course In that re?
spect. Through many anxious months
I have striven for that object, amidst
drfnucltlee more manifold than, can
have been apparent upon the surface;
and so far I have succeeded. I do not
doubt that I shall continue to succeed.
The course which the central Euro?
pean powers have announced their In?
tention of following In the future with
regard to undorsea warfare seems for
the moment to threaten Insuperable
obetaclea. but Its apparent meaning
le eo manifestly inconsistent with ex?
plicit assurances recently given by
those powers with regards to their
treatment of merchant vessels on the
high seas that I must believe that ex
phviations will presently ensue which
wit put a different aspect upon it. We
hase no reason to question their good
faith or their fidelity to their prom?
ises In the past, and, X for one, feel
confident that we shall have none In
the future.
"Out In any event our duty Is clear.
No nation, no group of nations, has
the right while war is In progress to
alter or disregard the principles which
all nations have agreed upon In miti?
gation of the hoirors and sufferings of I
war. and If the clear rights of Amen - I
ran cltisens should ever uphapplly be 1
abridged or denied by any such ac- I
tlon, we should. It seems to me, have
In honor no choice as to what our own
coune should be.
"For my own part, I can not con
eent to any abridgment of the rights
of America citizens in any respect
The honor and self-respect of the na?
tion le Involved. We covot peace and
shall preserve it at any cost t>ut the
loss r>t honor. To forbid our people to
exercise their Ights for fear we might
be called upon to vindicate them j
would be a deep humiliation. Indeed.
It would be an Implicit, all but ex-'
pllclt. acquiescence In the violation of
the rights of mankind everywhere and 1
of whatever nation or allegiance. It i
I_'__s_i_ -
would Do p. deliberate abdication of
our hitherto proud position ae spokes?
man, even amidst the turmoil of war,
for the law and the right. It would
make everything this government has
attempted and everything that it has
achieved during this terrible struggle
of nations meaningless and futile.
"i't Is Important to reflect that if In
this Instance we allowed expediency
to take the place of principle the door
would inevitably be opened to still
further concessions. Once accept a
single abatement of right and many
other humiliations would certainly
follow, and the whole fine fabric of
International law might crumble un?
der our hands piece by piece. What
ws are contending for In this matter
is of the very essence of the things
that have made America a sovereign
nation. She can not yield them with?
out conceding her own lmpotency as
a nation and making virtual surren?
der of her Independent position among
the nations of the world.
"I am speaking, my dear senator,
In deep solemnity, without heat, with
a olear consciousness of the high re?
sponsibilities of my office and as your
sincere and devoted friend. If we
should?unhappjly differ, we shall dif?
fer as friends, hut where issues so mo
speak dur minds without reservation.
"Faithfully yours,
"Woodrow Wilson."
The president wrote his letter dur?
ing the afternoon, shutting himself
up in his study while congressional
leaders vainly attempted to get him
on the telephone to toll him of de?
velopments at the capltol and arrange
for the call of the house leaders. He
continued to write after telephone
aonferences with cabinet officers and
other close advisers. His decision was
to end all speculation as to what the
position of the government was and to
let congress and the country know
that the administration believed the
United States could do nothing but
stand, behind the right of its citizens
to the freedom of the seas.
At the state department today It
was stated that in Its international
aspects the situation has not changed
In the slightest degree for three or
four days. Officials said nothing had
been heard from Germany in re?
sponse to the request of the United
State? for assurances that previous
pledges given In the Lusltania and
Arab c negotiation's would net be nul?
lified by the new campaign against
armed ships.
Confidential adv.ces from Berlin,
however, have indicated that Ger
many would reply that all assurances
I previously given would be observed
but that they applied only to unarmed
vessels, and would propose discussion
of what defensive armament proper?
ly may be. How far such a proposal
would go towards altering tho situa?
tion is said to depend largely upon
additional information as to how
armed British merchantmen are said
i to have warred on German subma?
rines, which is on the way to Wash?
ington by mall.
Administration officials reiterated
(today the declaration that the United
States never had departed since tho
beginning of the submurine contro- f
versy from Us firm stand for the ob?
servance of international law, and
they point out that throughout his?
tory the right of a merchantman to
carry limited armament solely for de?
fense never has been questioned.
Today's developments in congress
showed the administration leaders
holdin< their lines against any such
action as tho president opposes. A
canvass of the senate disclosed senti?
ment in favor of President Wilson'*
position dominating. In the house tln>
administration position was less cor- i
tain but tho leaders were confident
that a vote would show ar over?
whelming majority for upholding the
president.

'Dear Mr. President:
"Since Senator Kern, Mr. Flood and
I talked with you on Monday evening,
I am more troubled than I have, been,
for many a day. I have not felt au?
thorized to repeat our conversation
but I have attempted. In response to
numerous inquiries from my' col?
leagues, to state to them, within the*
conlldonce that they should observcv
my general understanding of your at
ititude. I have stated my understand-'
ing of your attitude to be substan?
tially as follows:
"That while you would deeply,
gret the rejection by Great Brit
[of Mr. Lansing's proposal for the dis?
armament of merchant vessels of the
allies with the understanding
[upon a merchant ship if she halted
when summoned, not attempting to
escape, and that the German war
(ships would only exercise the admit?
ted right of visitation and search and
would not destroy the captured ship
except in circumstances that reason?
ably assured the safety of passengers
jand . crew, you were of the opinion
that if Great Britain and her fellies
rejected the proposition and insisted
upon arming her merchant ships she
Would bo within right under inter?
national law. Also that you would
feel disposed to allow armed vessels
to be oleared from our ports; also that
you are not favorably disposed to the
idea of this government taking any
definite steps toward preventing Amer?
ican citizens from embarking upon
armed merchant vesels. Furthermore
that, you would consider it your duty,
If a German warship should fire upon
an armed merchant vessel of the
enemy upon which American citizens
were passengers to hold Germany to
strict account.
"Numerous members of the senate
and the house have called to discuss
this subject with me. 1 have felt that
fthe members of the two houses who
are to deal with this grave question
were entitled to know the situation
we are confronting as I understand it
to be. I think I should say to you
that the members of both houses foel
deeply concerned and disturbed by
what they read and hear. I have
heard of some talk to the effect that
some are saying that after all it may
be possible that the programme of
preparedness, socalled, has some rela?
tion to such a situation as we are now
called upon to meet. I have counseled
all who have talked with me to keep
cool; that this whole business is still
the subject of diplomacy and that you
are striving to the utmost to bring
about some peaceable adjustment and
that In tho meantime congress should
be careful not to 'ball up* a diplomatic
situation by any kind of hasty and ill
considered action. However, the situa?
tion in congress is such as to excite a
sense of deep concern in the minds of
careful and thoughtful men. I have
felt that It Is due to you to say that
much.
"I think you understand my per?
sonal attitude with respect to this sub?
ject. As much and as deeply as I
would hato to radically dlsaKree with
you, I find It dUllcult for my sense of
duty and responsibility to consent to
plunge this nation into tho vortex of
thlfl world war becauso of the unrea?
sonable obstinacy of any of the
powers upon the ono hand, or, on tho
other hand, of foolhardlness, amount?
ing to a sort of moral treason against

Washington, Feb. 25.?From inter?
views given The State's correspond?

of the South Carolina delegation in
congress when asked for an ex?
pression of opinion on the armed mer?
chantmen controversy, there would
appear to be almost practical unanim?
ity among those who gave their
views for supporting the president.
Senator Tillman said: "I certainly
will support the president. He has
more sense than all the other little
fellows combined. I think ha has pa?
triotism enough to satisfy any one;
furthermore, I don't see why they
don't let him alone."
Senator E. D. Smith said: "I will
support the president until he has ex?
hausted every known resource at his
command to prevent war, and until
every remedy has been fully ex?
hausted. Until that time shall arVlve
I do not think It wise for congress to
Interfere."
Representative Nlcholls said: At
this time I have not altogether made
up my mind and for the present I
would prefer to have nothing to say
on the subject."
Congressman Lever said:' 'I think
the less interference by congress with
the president at this most critical
period in these diplomatic negotia?
tions, the more likelihood there Is of
the president being able to preserve
the peace. When the president has ex?
hausted every diplomatic effort and
nothing can save the country from
war except the passage of some sueh
resolution as is proposed in that event
It will be time for the congress to
act." . . . ? \.

of America arc not cowards, that they
want peace, but peace only with
