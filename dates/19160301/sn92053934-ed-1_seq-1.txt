BRITISH STEAMSHIP SUNK
IN NEW SUBSEA WARFARE;
MEMBERS OF CREW LOST
Great Loss of Life Entailed
iii First Disaster of
Campaign.
ALL ABOARD PERISH
Entire Complement of Ship
Believed Killed or
Drowned.
London, March 1, (12:06 p. tu.)
The British steamship Thornaby Is re
ported to have been sunk, all the mem
bers of the crew having been killed
or drowned.
The Thornaby was owned in West
Hartlepool, England. Her gross ton
nage was 1.7S2. She was built in 1889
and was 25S feet long.
The Thornaby sailed on Jan. 19 from
Sunderland, England, for Palermo,
Sicily.
Although the British censorship
prevents transmission of details con
cerning the reported sinking - of the
Thornaby, the reference to the mem
bers of the crew having probably been
killed or drowned indicates she was
Bunk by a mine or a torpedo.
The German and Austrian decrees
regarding the sinking of armed mer
chantmen without warning went into
effect at midnight. The Thornaby is
the first vessel whose sinking has been
reported since the orders became op
erative but the London dispatch does
not indicate whether she was armed or
whether she was sunk before or after
the opening of the month.
British Steamer Destroyed.
Manchester, March 1, (12:47 p. m.)
The British steamer Spiraea from
Philadelphia, while discharging oil in
barrels here, caught fire last night.
The lire is still burning along the full
length of the ship.
Philadelphia, March 1. The Spiraea
had on board a million gallons of lub
ricating and refined oil, valued at
$113,000. The cargo was shipped by
the Standard Oil company.
Washington Anxious.
Washington, March 1 Administra-1
tlon officials today anxiously awaited
the results of the new Teutonic sub
marine campaign announced to begin
last midnight.
The attitude of the American gov
ernment toward the new policy of
sinking without warning armed
enemy merchant ships will not be fin
ally determined until the all-important
appendices to the latest German
memorandum arrived from Berlin.
The state department was prepared
today to take steps to determine what
has become of the appendices, which
were mailed from Berlin nearly three
weeks ago.
F.nglMi Expect Sea Disaster.
London, March 1, (5:19 a. m.) The
newspapers this morning dwell on the
fact that this is the last day for vol
untary enlistment in the British army
and that it is also the first in what Is
called the new German submarine
campaign. Large numbers of recruits
presented themselves during the last
few days at British recruiting offices,
to escape the odium of being forcib
ly enrolled under the compulsion act,
but it Is remarked that there has been
no overwhelming rush of recruits.
With regard to the German subma
rine campaign, newspaper editorials
point out that, while it involves no
new principle, the Germans are un
likely to have made the announcement
with wide publicity unless they be
lieve they will be able to make a
wholesale onslaught on shipping. The
new threat accordingly is not made
the object of ridicule an dlt is sug
the object of ridicule and It Is sug
ity haB been producing new and more
Powerful submarines. The editcrials.
however, agree in declaring that an
optimistic spirit should be felt and
that every confidence should be placed
In the power of the British navy to
cope with any new developments at
sea.

OFFEtiS PLAII TO
PREVENT FLOODS
Second Cousin of Bryan Tells House
Committee of His "Diversion
Canal" Idea.
Washington, March 1. What is de
scribed as a new method of flood pre
vention, to be accomplished by the
construction of "shallow, graduated,
diversion canals" to connect the bends
in a river to allow a straight-away
flow of waters at flood time, was ex
plained to the house committee on
flood control today by its inventor,
John Bryan of ellow Springs, Ohio.
He is a second cousin of William Jen
nings Bryan.
The committee recently returned
from an inspection of the flood district
in the Mississippi river valley. To
day's hearing was the first of a series
on the subject. With maps and mod
els Mr. Bryan explained his plans.
Under Mr. Bryan's plan, canals of
masonry would be constructed across
peninsulas at the bends of rivers. The
intake of the canal would be on the
level with the normal surface water
of the river and at flood time the wa
ters would be diverted from the slow,
crooked, impeding natural river chan
nel to a straight, swift, smooth side,
level bottom channel, which, he said,
would carry the excess waters away
nearly fifty times faster than the nat
ural channels would. The natural,
crooked river channel would be main
tained, however. He explained that
his method was devised under the
theory that it is the accumulated wa
ter in a devious, uneven constructed
channel of a river that causes the
.Hood. .;

THE WAR
TODAY
The German drive on Verdnn has
been halted, according to Paris of
ficial statements which declare the
situation satisfactory. The Berlin
statement does not mention Ver
dun. Activities of the contending
armies north of Verdnn have been
somewhat lessened and east of
Verdun the French have been able
w 1th their artillery to stop German
preparations for further advances
toward the fortress.
In the Champagne district the
French occupied the crater of a
mine exploded by the Germans and
near Seppois the Germans were
driven ont of trenches they had
previously ocenpied.
The Germans have captured an
armored work northwest of Ver.
dun and have taken the towns of
Manheulies and Champion, 13
miles sontheast of Verdun. Ber
lin reports that they have taken
prisoner 228 officers, 16,575 men
and captured a large number of
guns and much war material.
The German advance to the east
of Verdun has extended over a
front of virtually 12 miles from
Dieppe to Campion. The Havas
agency says: "In a word the Ger
man offensive has been suspend
ed but not stopped. It would be
risky at present to say whether
the pause is due to the fact that
the Germans realize that all ef
forts to take Verdun are in vain
and are simply defending positions
they have so dearly bought or
whether the German troops are
merely resting before being burled
forward again (o the assault."
There IiaTe been a number of
fights in the air between British
and German aviators in Belgium.
Germany opened her new subma
rine campaign today. The British
ship Thornaby has been sunk and
all her crew killed or drowned.
The question of a declaration of
war on Germany Is expected to be
considered by the Italian parlia
ment which reassembled today.
Russia'sdaiJy war expense Is 31,
000,000 rubles. Her total 1915 ex
pense was 8.000.000.000 rubles.
That of 1916 is expected to reach
11,000,000,000, according to the
budget laid before the duma.
The Russians have driven the
Germans back in the Dvinsk reg
ion. President Wilson has thrown
the gauntlet to congress over the
resolutions that have been intro
duced, having as their purpose the
warning of Americans from trav
eling on armed merchant ships.
He has asked that the matter be
brought to a vote in the house and
he will ask that a similar vote be
taken in the senate.
MARKET TUMBLES
AT WILSON MOVE
New York Stock Exchange Faces
Grave Situation Because of Strain
in Armed Ship Issue.
New York, March 1. The uncertain
outlook caused by the greater strain
in the foreign situation resulting from
President Wilson's determination to
force the issue on armed ships in con
gress, contributed almost entirely to a
fall in prices in today's market reach

WILSON FOES
IN CONGRESS
STRUCK BLOW
President Demands Warning
Resolutions Be Brought
Up for Vote.
TO CLEAR SITUATION
Wants Complete Unity in the
House and Senate to Back
His Foreign Policy.
Washington, March 1. At an early
conference at the White house today
President Wilson and administration
leaders made plans for bringing the
armed ship agitation in congress to
an end at once with a demonstration
of unity to convince Germany that the
American congress stands behind the
foreign policy of the government and
thus relieve the president of embar
rassment in his negotiations with Ger
many. Confident that they can beat all antt
administration resolutions by a heavy
vote, the president and the leaders
framed plans to bring them out first
on the floor of the house, where they
plan to defeat them and put through
a vote of confidence in the president.
The president paved the way for his
action last night and incidentally sur
prised congress by calling on Acting
Chairman Pou of the house rules com
mittee to provide the parliamentary
machinery for immediate consideration
of the resolutions on the floor.
At today's conference, to which the
president summoned Chairmen Stone
, and t Flood of - the' senate and house
committees dealing with foreign af
fairs; Senator Kern, democratic floor
leader; Speaker Clark and Majority
Leader Kitchin of the house, he ex
plained his purpose fully.
Agree to Taking Vote.
The conference agreed that in defer
ence to the wishes of President Wilson
a vote would be taken soon in senate
and house on resolutions warning
Americans to keep off the armed ships.
Its form will be determined late
After the conference Chairman Flood
called his committee together. It was
almost certain that the parliamentary
situation in both house would pre
vent a vote today.
The president made it clear that he
did not want a vote on a resolution
expressing support of his conduct of
the diplomatic controversy, and as a
result of his position the vote will be
taken on a resolution warning Ameri
cans off armed ships.
Speaker Clark and Majority Leader
Kitchin said no action could be taken
today in the house and that the con
ference had been devoted chiefly to dis
cussing procedure.
The president told the leaders the
foreign situation was no more seri
ous today than it has been for several
weeks but he believed action should
be taken quickly to show the world the
American government was not divided.
Speaker Clark, who predicted last
week that a warning resolution would
pass two to one at that time, said he
did not know the sentiment of the
house now and refused to say how he
himself would vote.
To Express Confidence.
House leaders today drafted for con
sideration of the house a measure pro
posing that congress express its con
fidence in the president's handling of
the armed merchantmen controversy
and recognize that it is not a matter
of legislative but of executive concern.
Germany's latest assurances on the
conduct of submarine warfare, pre
sented Monday by Count von Bern

EIVE OUT POLICY
FOR DIAZ REVOLT
Publish Agreement on Which Mexi
can Leader Wfll Support in His
"ew Uprising.
San Antonio, Texas, March 1. An
agreement on which Felix Diaz will
ask the Mexican nation to support
him in a new revolution against the
de facto government was made public
here last night by Diaz adherents in
the publication of a manifesto which
revealed that Diaz has reached Mex
ico to begin operations against Car
ranza forces. The manifesto was is
sued by Diaz partisans in the state of
Vera Cruz and was approved by him
when he arrived In his native country.
The agreement is as folows:
"We will name the army the 're
organized national army.'
"We name as general In chief of
said army the citizen Felix Diaz.
"We confer on said chief during the
time required to reorganize the insti
tution and reestablishment of peace
extraordinary authority in all the
branches of warfare, state and govern
ment.
"The reorganized national army
will comply with and observe all de
crees or orders issued by the general
in chief by which he is authorized
under this act.
"We declare that on the 10th of
October, 1913, General Huerta, when
he dissolved the congress of the un
ion, interrupted the order of the con
stitution when he constituted himself
an usurper of the public function.
With respect to the functionaries who
contracted responsibilities for any act
that they committed, the subject is to
be tried by law and the tribunals of
our country."

BOTH SIDES CLAIM
CHICAGO VICTORY
Administration and Its Foe Each Sure
the Other Is Defeated Woman
Vote light.
Chicago, March 1. Both adminis
tration and anti-administration men
claimed victory today after analyzing
the vote at the aldermanic primary
yesterday.
Mayor Thompson pointed to a total
of 27 republican aldermanic nomina
tions supported by him as evidence of
victory. Anti-administration forces
based their claim of success on the
fact that seven of the "rebel nine" ald
ermen, as Thompson's principal an
tagonists were styled, had been nom
inated. Mayor Thompson lost his home
ward (Twenty-third) by 2,500. Fred
Lundin, the mayor's chief political ad
viser, carried his ward (Thirty-third)
by 3,200.
One of the surprises was the vote in
the Seventh ward, a republican strong
hold and the home of Alderman Charles
E. Merriam, leader of the anti-administration
forces, where Alderman John
N. Kimball was renominated by 158
votes. He will probably face a re
count. Kimball was one of the "rebel
nine" and a spirited campaign was
made for and against him. His friends
expected victory by several thousand.
Both of the republican factions de
clared their determination today to
continue the fight
In the democratic primaries friendB
of Roger C. Sullivan, who battled with
supporters of former Mayor Carter H,
Harrison, declared that they won in
31 of the 35 wards.

london, March 1 (4:47 p. m.)
Germany has sent an ultimatum
to Portugal demanding the res
toration within 48 hours of the
German ships recently seized by
that country, according to a dis
patch from Madrid to Renter's
Telegram company.
The first seizure of German mer
chant vessels by Portugal occurred
Feb. 23 at Lisbon when the naval
authorities took 36 German and
Austrian ships in the Tagus. On
Feb. 25 the seizures of eight Ger
man ships by Portuguese authori
ties at St. Vincent, Cape Verde Is
lands, was announced.
A Lisbon dispatch on Feb. 26
quoted Premier Costa of Portugal
as declaring in the chamber of dep
uties that the government action
in requisitioning vessels had been
prompted by the necessities of the
nation's economic situation.
Paris, March 1 (2:30 p. m.) There
is nothing of importance to report in
the region to the north of Verdun or
in the Woevre district, according to
the announcement of the progress of
hostilities made by the French war
office this afternoon.
There was an intermittent bombard
ment last night along the French front
between Regnlevllle and Remenau
ville. West of Pont-A-Mousson French ar
tillery fire was directed against the
second and third of the enemy's lines,
where the Germans apparently were
putting through certain preparatory
evolutions.
In the region of Cernay, valley of
the Thur, a French aeroplane, with
double motors, was successful In an.
encounter with an aeroplane of ttie
enemy. The German machine fell at
La Bassee into the German trenches
and caught on fire.
German Report.
Berlin, March 1 (via London, 3:15
p. m.) No mention of fighting at Ver
dun is made in the official statement
today.
The report follows:
"Western front: Activity of the ar
tillery was very great on various parts
of the front and particularly on the en
emy's side. In the Yser region in the
Champagne and between the Meuse
and the Moselle he seemed to be en
deavoring to do damage, but did not
achieve his object.
"In an aerial combat a British bi
plane was forced down near Menin.
The occupants were made prisoner.
Two French biplanes were brought
down by our anti-aircraft guns, one
near Vezaponin, northwest of Sols
sons, the occupants of which were
captured, the other due west of Sols
sons, the occupants of which appar
ently were dead.
"An aeroplane piloted by Lieuten
ant Kueple, carrying an observation
officer, Lieutenant Faber of the re
serve, brought a military transport to
a standstill on the Besanson-Jussey
road by dropping bombs, and then
successfully fought the men of the
transport with machine guns.
"Eastern and Balkan fronts: There
is nothing to report"
Heavy Calibre Gnns Taken.
Dispatches to the Lokal Anzeiger,
dealing with the recent fighting on the
Verdun front in the Woevre region,
state that when the German occupied
the wood3 of Hennemont, seven kilo
metres south of Etaln, several cannon
of the heaviest calibre were captured,
together with other guns.
The German advance continued
westward, the correspondent recount,
until at several places the foot of Cote
Lorraine was reached. He declares
that the French have been forced out
of Ftesnes, 4 kilometres west of
Marcheville. They were able to main
tain themselves there until Feb. 28, but
then were compelled to withdraw un
der German pressure.
All the correspondents agree that
the territory over which the Germans
advanced was exceptionally difficult
for attack and are deeply impressed
by what they characterise as the "won
derful, pushing, never-tiring elan" of
the German troops.
i All the correspondents insist on the
smallneas of the German casualties.
