L,OXIoX, Maren I. Germany's
r.ew submarine war against British
shipping, a threatened in the warn
ing notice to the United States gov
ernment, waa opened on scheduled
time. The kaiser's sea offensive
against tht Prltish was set tu go
into effect at midnight and tefore
noon word had been reclved of the.
torpedoing of two merchantmen.
They were the Thornaby, 1.7H2 tons,
and the Malvina, 1,24 4 tons.
It la announced that all the mem
"bers of the crew of the Thornaby
wer killed -by the attack or drowned.
The dispatch which reported the
destruction of the Malvina off the
Kentish coast did not mention the
fate of the crew.
The Thornaby hailed from West
Hartlepool and was built In 1889.
She was engaged in the freight
trade.
The Malvina hailed from Ielth.
She was an old vessel, having been
bullt In 1R73.
ßubs Were Heady.
From the speed with which the
new Germaji mibmartne -war was
launched in Hrltish waters it was ev
ident that submarines had been sent
out In advance with orders to U-gin
nttack as soon as any enemy's ships
were sighted today.
The German notieo of the fresh
offensive against English shipping
had stated that armed merchant'
hlp! were to be attacked without
notice, but there was nothing to
show that the Thornaby and Mal-
-vina bor puns.
News of the sinking of the ships

Tt is believed that there are at

although they have made Important

gains are not regailod seriously by
French military experts, who hold
that the CJerman losses were out of
proportion to the ground gained and
that the heights of the Mouse cannot
be taken by storm except through a
miracle of military strategy.

Well authenticated stories to the
effect that John W. Toyne, superin
tendent of waterworks, wa.s to have
tendered his resignation to the board
of public works today, "for the good
of the service," as it was put, failed
to materialize at the session of the
board, in consequence of which,
differences said to have been large

patched up. There is no question
but that the resignation got a-s far
as the typewritten and signed stage,
whether as a bluff, to bring the
board of works to time, or in all
sincerity, "deponents saith not."
Those close to th? situation assert
that the once pending break be
tween the board of works and their
waterworks superintendent, was due
to their mistaking his profession of
hydrau.ic engineer for that of a po
litical engineer, and that the "good

prepared resignation referred, was
the "political service" which the
board of works way insisting upon.
The situation appear to have been
that the board was Insisting upon
his doing exactly what the board of
education, knowing that Supt. L. J.
Montgomery of the public scho-ols,
would not do, determined to dismiss
him. Whether or not Supt. Toyne

Fate Hangs in Balance
Meeting Today War
is Still Popular.
Intercatl'Minl News Service:
ROME. March 1. The fate of the
Italian cabinet headeo by Premier
Salandra hung In the ba nce today
when parliament met. i hssensions
which have arisen as a result of
changed political conditions, threat
en to brin-.' about a reorganization
of the government.
While the war is popular today
as It was nine months asjo the cab
inet has lost rather than gained
strength. This is held to be due to
the change of attitude assumed by
some of the members of the inter
ventionist party.
As to the causes of this change
of attitude, opinions differ. First of
all, the reform wing of the socialist
party, which was strongly in favor
of intervention, and consistently
supported the present cabinet dur
ing the first months of the war, has
now publicly expressed its lack of
confidence In the government. The
premier and his advisers are accused
of adopting a ruinous economic pol
icy which is causing great hard
ships among the middle and lower
elapse. Food is high and money is
scarce.
Another reason, however, is ad
vanced. According to what has
transpired the reformists are no
longer inclined to identify them
selves with the government and
share its tremendous responsibilities
in a war whose ultimate outcome is
still dubious. Leaders of the reform
ist wing are asking:
"What has accrued to Italy? And
in answer it must be said that little
BREAK
progress has been made against Aus- widely circulated abroad, that the
tria in Trentino and Istria, while j counlry was not behind the presi

the possessions of which has been ,,rring the diplomatic negotiations
one of Italy's fondest dreams, has j JVtwcen this country and the central
been lost to Austria. in audition
Italy has gained the
enmity of
powerful Germany.
Xext to the reformists thre demo
cratic and nationalist groups of
parliament have also expressed dis
content with the government's pro
gram. These two parties were both
among the staunchest supporters of
the government in its policy of in
tervention and, besides advocating
war against Austria, were in fa vor of
beginning hostilities against Ger
many. For months they confidently
awaited an incident which would
justify Italy in declaring war against
Germany and when it became appar- j
ent that., for reasons still unknown,!
the Salandra cabinet would never,
take su;h a step they accused the
government of lack of cooperation .
with the allies. .
