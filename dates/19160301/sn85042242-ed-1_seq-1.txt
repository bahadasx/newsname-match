IS Killed
in a Mine
Explosion
Kerapton, W. Va., Feb 2tt.—Fifteen
men were killed and five seriously in­
jured by an explosion of dust in mine
No. 42, of the Davis Coal & Coke
company, here today. All the victims
were foreigners.
Fifty-one miners, who were also at
work at the time, were rescued. The
exploration of the workings was com­
pleted late today and ail the bodies
recovered.
The explosion occurred this morn­
ing, shortly after the men had enter­
ed the mine. The blast, however, did
not interfere with the working of the
cages in the main shaft, and the men
not within range of the explosion
hurried to the foot of the shaft, and
were at once brought to the surface.
According to General Superintend­
ent Maloney, all the victims -were
crushed under a fall of slate.
The entrance of the mine is located
in Kempton, but the mine extends
back into Garrett county, Maryland,
where the explosion occurred. For
this reason, it has not yet. been deter­
mined whether the authorities of this
state or Maryland will investigate.
DEFENSE BILL

Committee Has Whipped Measure
Into Shape for Presenta­
tion.
PROPOSE GREATEST
increases in HISTORY
Washington, Feb. 28.—The cam­
paign for national preparedness will
enter on a new phase in congress
next week, when, in all probability,
bills providing for' increasing the
army to an extent never before con­
templated in time of peace will lfe in­
troduced in both the house and sen­
ate.
The house military committee will
begin tomorrow its final review of
the measure tentatively agreed upon
last week. The final vote probably
will be taken Thursday, but. it will
require several days for Chairman
Hay to prepare a report to accom­
pany the bill.
The senate committee agreed to
day to inserC only a general provision
for federalization of the National
Guard in its regular army reorgani­
zation measure, leaving the task of
putting this legislation in final shape
to the joint conference committee, to
which the bills will go. By this
action the senate committee made it
possible to bring out its bill also
next week.
Before the house naval committee,
Rear Admiral Knight continued today
his recommendation that every facil­
ity in the country be employed to
hasten construction of a fleet equal
to those of any two nations except
Great Britain.
Admiral Knight said he believed it
would take two years and a half to
make the navy efficient enough to
meet the present German fleet with
any hope of success.
MUST SHIP GOOD EGGS
Washington, Feb. 29—Eggs, not 93
oer cent good, will be barred from
interstate commerce hereafter, under
a ruling today bv the Department of
Agriculture?. Shinpsrs packing more
than 5 per cent bad eggs will be re­
garded as violating the food and
drugs act by adulteration.

WILSON ASKS
Commercial Organizations
of England Discuss Trade
Relations and the Tariff
London, Feb. 29.—Trade after the
war was discussed by a notable gath­
ering today of the representatives of
all the great commercial organiza­
tions of the country forming the Brit­
ish Association of Chambers of Com­
merce. Upward of 1000 delegates
were present, including the chief
figures in all the Lay industries.
The main interest of the gathering
centered in a change in Great Brit­
ain's tariff system, allowing virtually
free admission of foreign imports,
owing to the prevailing belief that
Great Britain's free markets have
been one of the chief sources of the
building up of English industry.
Several important resolutions were
adopted after an extended debate,
two of them reflecting overwhelming­
ly the sentiment for an entire re-
Will Not Continue Negotiations
Until He Gets Vote of Con­
fidence:
DEMANDS PROMPT ACTION
OF BOTH THE HOUSES
This Policy Decided Upon at Con­
ference of Leaders With
President.
Washington, Feb. 29.—President
Wilson decided today that he cannot
proceed with the German submarine
negotiations while dissention in con­
gress weakens his position before the
world, so lie called for a show down
on the pending proposals to warn
Americans off merchantships of the
European belligerents armed for de­
fense.
Making clear thai he considers the
president, and not congress, is charg­
ed with the conduct, of the foreign
relations of the United Stales, he
I wrote a letter to Representative Pou,
acting chairman of the house rules
committ.ce, asking him to provide par­
liamentary means for bringing the
agitation out into the open on the
floor of the house for full discussion
and a vote.
Calls Conference.
Later, he summoned Senator Stone
and Representative Flood, chairman
of the foreign affairs committees, and
Senator Kern, majority leader in the
senate, for a conference at the White
House tomorrow, at which time he
will request that one of the pending
resolutions be acted upon in both
houses.
Administration leaders working
support of 1he Republicans, now are
so sure of their position that, they
plan to end all agitation with a vote
of confidence in the president.
Prompt Action Desired.
This course was decided upon after
today's cabinet meeting, at which it
was discussed, and after a week's
quiet steady work at the capitol.
Prompt action is desired, particu­
larly in the house where agitation
has been most fervent, and where
Speaker Clark predicted anti-adminis­
tration resolutions, when first intro­
duced, would have passed by a major­
ity of two to one. There never has
ueen any question of the administra­
tion control on the senate side.
Adoption of the pending resolution
would practically amount to congres­
sional repudiation of policies an­
nounced and contended for by Presi­
dent Wilson and Secretary Lansing
all through the submarine negotia­
tions, which more than once were in
a crisis.
Victory Is Necessary.

BIG BILL WINS
FIRST SKIRMISH
Chicago, Feb. 29.—Six of the nine
wards whose aldermen revolted
against Mayor Hale Thompson nomi­
nated Thompson candidates.
The mayor's candidates were re­
turned in the Third, Thirteenth and
Thirty-third wards.
Women, as well as men, voted. In
all 200 wards of the city. 35 put up
anti-Thompson tickets, but the fight
centered in nine of these.
I adjustment of the British economic
and trade policy.
One resolution for reciprocal trade
relations and tariff created some op
position, but finally prevailed with
virtual unanimity. It provides:
First, for preferential trading re­
lations between all British countries.
Second, for reciprocal trading rela­
tions between the British empire snd
allied countries.
Third, for favorable treatment of
neutral relations with enemy coun­
tries.
Fourth, for restriction by tariff and
otherwise on all trade relations with
enemy countries, so as to make it
impossible to return to pre-war con­
ditions.
The Bradford delegation urged ab­
solute prohibition of further .dealings
with Germany, but this did not pre­
vail.

Triumph of Season
Scored by the Ladies
in Dance Last Evening
The social triumph of the season
was scored by the ladies of the Com­
mercial club with their Leap Year
dancing party, which ended at a rath­
er alarmingly early hour this morn­
ing. In originality of conception,
daintiness of execution, in pure en­
joyment from the opening number to
the last, no function of its kind which
Bismarck has known in many a year
has proven more successful.
The attendance numbered almost
200, and the floor was at times almost
too crowded for comfortable dancing,
but as the evening grew older this
condition was improved by the sy»
tem employed of serving luncheon in
relays, and there were several hourx
of dancing in which everyone entered
vith enthusiasm and spirit. The eve­
ning's one regret was the music. For
some reason which is not explained,
the attractive program which had

Whole Area Within Salient Is a
Vast Fortification Thousands
of Guns Command Paths of the
Germans.
What motives actuated the German
general staff in sending the crown
prince's army in present tremendous
onslaught directly against Verdun it­
self, instead of as in the previous at­
tacks, against the northern flank of
the fortress, in the Argonne west of
the Meuse, in the hope of isolating it,
are not yet clear.
Verdun lies in the extreme point of
a. great salient angle of the Frencn
lines. If it were lost the French
could fall back, at most, to the line
of the Aire and have a straighter line
than before, and the Germans would
have lo embark on further attacks.
I'Jven if they reached Aire, the v.it
mans really would be no nearer Paris
than they iiave been for a year and
a half past along the Aisne, and they
also,, would haye. nuiivy mile* t» go be
before threatening the great trunk
railways front Paris to Nancy, Ton),
kpiual and Belfort and the, Vosges
front.
Would Strengthen Germans.
The Germans, however, would have
immensely strengthened their own
position from the defensive point.
Verdun is of more importance to the
French as a threat lo the German
Argonne position 011 one side and the
St. Mihiei salient on the other, and
as a. starting point for a future at­
tack on Metz, than if is as a defense
point.
The present battle raging around
Verdun is I lie greatest on the west­
ern front since the Champagne and
Arlois battles last September, and
by far the greatest German attack
in the west since the first battle of
Ypres in November, 191-1. The front
attacked by the Germans is nearly
as long as the front, in Champagne
on which the iFrench advanced last
September, the attacking forces em­
ployed must be nearly as large, and
the amount, of ground gained com­
pares favorably with the amount of
ground taken by the French on that
occasion. If only as showing that
the Germans still have men enough
to take the offensive on a large scale
in the west, the attack possesses great
significance.
Whole Salient a Fortification,
The whole area within the threat­
ened salient, however, if accounts are
true, is one vast fortification. Amer­
ican correspondents have been taken
over part of the Verdun lines, and
have reported that s.-iey form a laby­
rinth, line within line, with immense
subterranean passages in the rock
hundreds of feet below the earth's
surface, and with hundreds of guns
of all calibre mounted on track
ready to be rushed from point to
point hundreds of steel turrets and
thousands of machine guns.
Verdun at the outset of the war
(Continued on Page Two)
been arranged was discarded, and
the result was some confusion and
not a little dissatisfaction among
those who had come with the expect­
ation of enjoying favorite dance num­
bers and who were compelled to con­
tent themselves with the orchestra's
offerings.
Cotillions Prove Popular.
The cotillioii figures introduced by
Major F. S. Henry, assisted by Mrs.
F. A. Copelin, were the big hits of
the evening. In the first, the male
half of the dancing contingent de­
ployed through the club rooms "with
Major Henry at the head and return­
ed jwith some of the most fascinating
feminine headgear imaginable. The
creations were then transferred from
male heads to those for which they
were better suited, and with the room

One hundred of Washburn's most
prominent, and livest citizens were
named on a committee to prepare pe­
titions and put them in circulation
throughout the state. Hundreds of
telegrams were received yesterday by
President Klein when the news was
flashed across the state, promising to
support the movement. Many who
are opposed lo capital removal state
that they would favor moving the Ag­
ricultural college to the heart of the
great farming section of the state.
Will Push Project.
Washburn citizens have a knack of
getting what tljey go after, as is evi­
denced by the thriving, prosperous
city up the river. They are determin*
ed to push their fight for the Agricul­
tural college, and will leave no stones
unturned to accomplish their object.
The leaders do not anticipate any
difficulty in securing enough signa
tures to their petitions to bring the
question to a vote and they are more
than satisfied "to let the people vote
on it."

The fight for state institutions is

field, at a mass meeting of citizens
called to form the Agricultural Col­

of the Washburn citizens were in at­
tendance at the meeting and formu­

in less time than it takes to tell the
story, $10,000 was subscribed to start
the project moving.
"King" John Satterlund headed the
movement, which has been under con­

of the plan were not ready to open
their campaign at this time, but the
recent embroglio at the Agricultural
college convinced them that it was
time to fire the opening gun and, ac­
