Will Barton Buy a Sione Crusher?
The only article, in the town meeting
warning that appears to savor of any
thing out of the ordinary is article 22,
which reads, "To see if the town will
vote to purchase a stone crusher, and
if so to instruct the selectmen to buy
the same." Of course there are the
articles calling for the direct primary
vote, the Perry referendum vote and
to see if the town will vote to install
the uniform town accounting system
recommended by a state commission,
and all the usual articles, 24 in all.
Little excitement is heard over town
events. The printed reports now in
the hands of the voters show that the
town is a little over $1700 worse off
than last year.

GREAT CONCERT FRIDAY EVENING.
Unquestionably the best concert
company visiting Barton in several
years is the Chicago Musical club,
which appears Friday evening at
Seaver's opera house as the last num
ber of the lecture course.
The company comprises six people,
who render a mixed program of instru
mental and vocal music in orchestral
combinations and solo parts. Each
member is a star and yet their pro
gram is so arranged that the average
person enjoys every moment.
The Chicsgo Musical club ha3 gained
a reputation which warrants saying
that any who miss the concert Friday
evening will miss one cf the very best
entertainments coming to this town in
years and you are urged to get your
tickets at Pierce's early. There is
bound to be a full house.
Methodist Episcopal Church Notes.
The subject of the morning sermon
was "Turning the Eyes Inward."
What a different community this would
be if we gave less attention to the
affairs of others and more to oar own
There is nothing we need so much as
to turn our eyes inward and see our
selves as we appear to those around
us. What impression am 1 making
upon those with whom I associate?
What do others see in my life? We
hold in our hands the destiny of others
We cannot live a life detached from
those about us. We are our brother's
keeper and God will hold us account
able for him. We assimilate into our
live3 something from everyhing that
our Jives touch from day to day. We
can never help another into the fold of
God as long as we are outside or
standing with one foot over the line.
Take God's mirror, the Bible, and look
for the beam in your own eye. for it
must come out before you can help
your brother remove the mote from
his eye. Religion is a garment to be
worn daily and it should beautify and
glorify the life of the one who wears
it.
The evening talk was by Rev. Glenn
Douglass of Glover. The subject was,
"Why Men Ought to Pray." The fact
that men have always prayed, proves
conclusively that prayer meets a need
in men's lives. Some very vital needs
that it meets today were mentioned and
emphasis placed upon our spiritual loss
when we live without prayer.
Prayer meeting on Thursday evening
at the usual hour.
I We are having very interesting and
helpful Epworth League meetings and
