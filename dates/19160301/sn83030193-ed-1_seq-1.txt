UNTERMYER IN DOUBT;
Chairman Osborn Opposes
Naming Him as One of
the "Big Four."
By Martin Green.
(Special Stuff Correspondent cf The
Evening World.)
srilACUSE. N. Y.. March 1. The
Democracy of the State of New York
met in oonvontlon at noon (here to
day to designate four delegatea-at-
large to the National Convention, to
adopt a platform of principles with
reference to national affairs and to
pledge tho party to tho renomtnatlon
nnd re-election of Woodrow Wilson.
This last was tho big object of the
assemblage, nnd no strango a thing
Is politics that the very men who
woro sending out to tho nation
pledge to work for Wilson's re-election
wero the men who stuck out to
tho last against hla nomination in
Ualtimoro in July, 1912.
Tho convention was In the hands of
organization men who have been com
pletely overlooked by President Wll
son in tho matter of patronage There
wero only a few Wilson or anti-Tammany
office holders, but tho regulars
who have been eating snowballs and
atmosphere wero out in force. It
must bo 'said In tho Interest of ver
aclty that a great many of tho dele
gates went about tho endorsement of
President Wilson and pledging them
selves to help along hla re-election
with nil tho earnest eagerness of n
man getting ready to have his right
eyn taken out.
They can't forget that tho only
Tammany Hall ofllco-holders In New
York are Thomas 1 Hush, who isn't
100 per cent, pure organization by any
means, and young Dan Finn. When
they cheered for Wilson to-day they
crossed their fingers, but tho exi
gencies of politics demand that they
be loyal to tho courso marked out for
them. Anyhow, they may feel more
cheerful when Election Day comes
around, eight months hence,
Stato Chairman William Church
Osborn has injectod the only dis
cordant noto Into tho cadence of
harmony prevalent hereabouts. Mr.
Osborn is opposed to tho selection
of Paniuc! Vntcrmycr as ono of the
HlK Four" delegates at Large.
Tho leaders who thought It would
bo a god idea to name Mr. t'ntor
myer havo nought in vain for a defi
nite reason why Mr. Osborn is
against Mr. Vntormyer. Mr. Osborn
merely says ho doesn't want Mr,
I'ntermyer named. He denies he is
opposed, to Mr. Untermyer because
Mr. Untermyer has at any ttmo been
active against any corporation."! In
which ho Is Interested.
Inasmuch aa under tho conditions
existing hero Mr. Osborn controls
very few votes, ho has no chance to
get up a regular light. The other
follows wouldn't fight with him, how
ever. They want to plenso him, and
If his peevo endures they may drop
I'ntermyer.
However, us tho convention assem
bled tlio sluto was Hcnator James A.
O'Gorman, George Meyer of lluffalo,
William Church Osborn and Samuel
Untermyer.

The latest discovered scheme for
charging additional "coats of con
struction" of the new subVrays to tho
City of Now York was brought out
by tho Therr.peon'lnveitigallng Com.
mlttee to-day. It is called tho "Forco
Account" It amounts to $120,000 a
year, and It Includes tho pay of law
ycrs, clerks, assessors of damages,
&o, who settle the claims of. cltlzenn
whoso property is damaged by the
new lines.
ti. Frank Kohlor. an engineer for
the Public Service Commission, was
stopped before ho could tell much
about it by the objection of James L,.
Quackenhush that publication ot tho
sums involved in settlements would
mako other property owners claim
more.
Mr. Kolilcr said, when be was
called to tho stand, that it would take
three vans to bring all tho documents
in the "Forco Account." Tho Intor-
borouglj makes tho "Forco Account"
a part of tho cost of construction of
the now subways and elevated ex
tensions. Q. What Interest has the city in
these charges? A. It forms tho basis
of tho Interest chargo on construction
which is to be deducted from oper
ating expenses.
Mr. Qtiackonbush objectod to put
ting tho Items of tho "Forco Account"
in evidence. Ho thought that attor
neys for property owners who are
trying to get big damngen out of the
city might get valuable Information
out of them. They might therefore
stand out for higher damages. Coun
sel Masn could not ace tbe fores of
this.
"Every crook in New York," ho
said, "knows Just what the District
Attorney gets and what every ono of
his assistants gets, but that doesn't
help them any."
The records wero put In evidence.
Mr. Kohler tostlfled that only the
"prior determination" account for the
first qunrtor year of "contract No. 3"

That Dear Prince Vanishes
l-'rom Her Ken as Court
Signs Parting Order.
The Prince nd I'rlncers havo port
ed. Unofficially nnd Informally, tho
event took place aomo tlmo ngo, but
formally it occurred this morning,
when Supremo Court Juslleo Clark
signed tho separation papers legally
parting tho Princess Mlsklnorf nnd
her husbnnd. Yvonne, tho foster
daughter of the Princess, remains
with her nnd tearfully declares sho
never was infatuated with tho Prince
and never will bo.
Tho most noticeable effect of tho
signing of the papers was In the
vicinity of tho Hotel Nethnrland, nt
Fifty-ninth Streot and Fifth Avenue,
where tho Princess, Yvonno and the
latest adopted baby occupy tho blue
and gold suite. An order of tho Prln
cess mado every bellhop, maid and
clerk remomber tho separation pa
porn had been signed. All thn pomp
of royalty surrounded tho Princess
yesterday at tho hotel. Ono had but
to ask for tho Princess nnd ovoryono
know who wns meant. To-day well,
thoro wan no Princess at the hotel
to-day.
"Princess Mlsklnoff? I,t mo see
Princess .Mlsklnoff where have I
heard that name before?" mused tho
clerk when inquiry wns made. "I
know I havo hoard it boforo, but I
can't think Just whore."
"I do not know of such a person,"
said the maid In tho bluo and gold
suite, when inquiry for the Princess
was made. "Ves, I am qulto sure I
do not know of such a person."
"Hut only yesterday"
"Ah, yesterday but that was yes
terday and to-day Is to-day. No, I
no not know of such a princess. Mrs.
Gouraud, Mrs. Almee Crocker Oour
aud, occupies this apartmont to-day
and luit now sho Is out for a little
health walk."
And so, with the signing of the
separation papers, rumen the passing
of the Princess. When the Prince
heads lor the Itusslan trenclus. us ho
win in a few days, ho will loao no
vestige of lils title behind. Mrs.
Oouraud Is trying to forgot every
thing she ever learned about tho Hua.
slan nobility and hor aensltlvo nature
will not permit her even to hear tho
word Prlnross again.
"No more of the foreign nobility for
mo," the Prlnress said to a friend.
"I want to forget till nbout It. lloth
Yvonno and I are tired and dlstressol
at all thoso court matters und I am
glad now It is ended. Wo shall go
away cry soon, probably to Florida,
for tho winter."
Yvonne was ill for several CuyH fol
lowing tho closo of the oeiiHutlonul
trial In which tho Prince told of hnr
alleged Infatuation for him, but io
has almost tintlrely recovered and
joined Mrs. (iuurauil In bur walk this
morning. She, too, professes h.iii
ni sm at tho prospert of seeing no more
of the Hussion nobility, but lu very
align when the Prince's 'itury of her
tnfatuution for him Is mentioned.

SQUADRONS OF U-RAIDERS
TO MEDITERRANEAN SEA
Paris Officially Announces That a
German Submarine Torpedoed the
Former French Liner Provence
With aLoss of atLeast 1,000 Lives
MANY BIG LINERS NOW
LONDON, March 1. FwelvC hours after Germany's new subji.
marine decree, sanctioning attacks without warning on belligerent arrned
merchant siips, went into effect word readied London of the sink'lngof,
the West Hartlepool steamer Thornaby. Lloyd's despatches reported
that all members of her crew liad been killed or drowned.
Although thn Hrltlsh censorship prevents transmission ot de
tails concerning tho reported sinking of tho Thornaby, the rofor
unco to tho members of tho crow having boon klllod or drowned
indicates shu was sunk by a mlno or a torpedo.
The first really great big sea tragedy, if one comes as the result of "
the new submarining decrees, is expected to occur in the Mediterranean.
The number of Austrian and German submersibles operating off the '
Italian coast is known to have been
senger liners are passing through that zone.
A despatch from Stockholm says the Swedish steamer Torborg has
been sunk in the Mediterranean by an Austrian submarine. Her owners
were notified to-day that the crew took to boats, were picked up and'
landed at Leghorn, Italy. The Torborg displaced 1,222 tons and was
owned at Lmdskrona, Sweden.
It became publicly known to-day, according to Paris reports, that It
was a German submarine which torpedoed and sank the French auxiliary
cruiser Provence in the Mediterranean on Saturday, with a loss of life
now estimated at between 900 and 1,100. Announcement that the
former French liner was torpedoed was made by the French Ministry
of Marine.
Though an official statement yesterday afternoon reported about
870 of the 1,800 persons aboard the Provence saved, the latest despatches
to-day accounted for only the 696 survivors landed at Malta and Melos.
It is believed possible, however, that other survivors were picked up by
Greek fishing craft in the vicinity and are being taken into Greek ports.
To-day's reports from the Ministry of Marine also carried the state. ,
ment that the Provence is the former great transatlantic liner of that
name, which was taken over early in the war and transformed Into an '
auxiliary cruiser.
