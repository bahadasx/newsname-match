NORTH STAR'S
CAMPAIGN TO
CLOSEMARCH 18
Success or Failure Depends Upon the
Efforts of Next Two Weeks.If
Friends and Supporters Come to
Aid of the Institution in a Very
Liberal Manner its Future Will Be
Secure.

was Raised in a Few Hours Near
Alvarado, and the Campaign has
Just Started.
March 18, 1916, is the date fixed by
Mr. James J. Hill when his condition
al offer to donate $9,000 to North
Star College will expire. The college
board had fixed March 1st as the time
when all subscriptions should be in,
this with a view of having sufficient
time to make collections and have all
financial matters arranged before Mr.
Hill comes here to check up.
There was such a large sum still
remaining to be raised on March first
that many men would say it cannot
be done. But not so the optimistic
members of the board of directors
and their co-laborers. They say that
it must be done and that with God's
help and the liberal financial assist
ance of friends and supporters of the
school, it will be done The future
the college must be assured. The
fild secretary, all the members of
the board of directors and many of
the teachers and students are out
soliciting funds. A citizens' commit
tee is at work in this city. All de
pends upon the success of these ef
forts. The various committees have
received a great deal of encourage
ment in their work. Friends of the
institution everywhere are rallying
to its rescue. As an illustration may
be mentioned that a committee work
ing near Alvarado raised $850 in but
a few hours work, and the campaign
has just started. 1 Hanks and God
bless you, good people. A willing
heart makes a willing purse. It is
absolutelv necessary that many large
subscriptions be secured before
Mai-ch 18. Now is the time to give
aid to North Star Colleere or never.
An opportunity like the one the
school has now to rid itself of debt,
may never come again. Big dona
tions like the one Mr. Hill has prom
ised are not easy to obtain Help the
college to get this money, and its
future will be assured. Do it before
March 18. Send all contributions to

A Leap Year Party.
On Feb. 29, the Ladies' Reading
Circle held a social meeting at the
home of Mrs. Spaulding. Consider
ing the date we might imagine of
what the program consistedhow
ever that would be impossible even
with the most vivid imagination. The
club was very fortunate in having
among their guests several famous
characters, among which were "Fat
ty Felix", "Billie Sunday", a French
Chef, Lafayette, Win. Penn, Hobson,
Baron Munchausen, Ichabod Crain
and two College Chums from U. of
M. A program of fun which savored
much of leaping vras rendered, vlt
would need more than a press report
er to give it in detail- The music
i .deserves special mention. A trio of
'harps rendered selections which ap
pealed to all listeners. The organ
solo was good, the Baron responding
to several encores most cheerfully.
Dancing, singing, games, when sever
al leaped into matrimony and the
grand march followed by the serving
of dainty refreshments brought to a
close another one of the club's social
meetings.

MARSHALL COUNTY HAS
SMALL FIRE LOSS-
Marshall county ranks among those
in Minnesota whose fire loss during
the year ended December 31, 1915,
was considerably reduced as compar
ed with the previous year.
This is shown by report issued by
Rober W. Hargadine, State Fire Mar
shal. During the twelve-month per
iod covered by the report there were
17 fires with an aggregate loss of
$7,035. In the corresponding period
in 1914 there were 11 fires and the
loss aggregated $28,200.
This is an agreeable situation and
shows beyond a doubt that the peo
ple of Marshall county are awake to
the necessity of fire prevention.
There is no doubt that the loss would
have been considerably greater if the
individual householder had not taken
proper precautions for safeguarding
his property, by eliminating the rub
bish heap, keeping gasoline and
other inflammable materials in taeir
proper places and beinn- watcsful of
I tse interns of toe community in
general in the prevention" of fires.
FLAKNE POSTMASTER HELD

er returns of moneys belonging to the

Flakne was brought to Crookston
late Saturday afternoon and taken be
fore U. S Commissioner W. Mur
phy, where he had a hearing. He
was held for trial to the federal dis
trict court at Fergus Falls, in the
sum of $1,000, bonds being furnished
by friends of the accused.

was served. The evening's
entertainment was featured by the
carrying out of an elaborate Leap
Year program.
Messrs 'Miller, Anderson and
Schenck, of the faculty, were enter
tained at Prof. Sjostrand-s home last
Sunday afternoon.
O. A. Schenck has charge of the
work in the Commercial department
during Prof. Sjostrand's absence.
Last Saturday evening, an excel
lent program was rendered in the
College chapel by the Whittier Lit
erary Society. One of the features
was a debate on the question: "Re-
solved, that advertising increases the
cost of living". The decision was
unanimous
in favor of the negative.
Misses Benson and Ackerman of the
Warren High School, and Miss San
din an alumni of North Star, acted
as judges.
Next Saturday evening, Monteville
Flowers will deliver a lecture at the
Warren Opera House on "World
Problems". This lecture will be a fit
ting close to the Lyceum Lecture
course for this season, as Mr. Flow
ers is one
of the foremost men on
the platform today\ He lectures on
present day themes, and we are look
ing forward to something of interest
to all, and something no one can
well afford to miss.
Preparations for the coming Inter
department basket ball tournament
are now in full swing. We are antic
ipating some hard fought battles for
the College championship. Schedule
of games will be announced later.
We are still enrolling students for
the present semester. Misses Ragna
Hafta and Lillie Nelson, both of
Adams, N. D., enrolled for work in
our Music department last Thursday.
The contestants for the Swedish
Declamatory Contest
are hard at
work. We have every reason to be
lieve that this contest will be one of
the best ever held at North Star.
We regret to say that Miss Dolpha
Strandquist has been obliged to dis
continue her work at North Star
owing to sickness in the family. We
sincerely hope that she may be with
us again next semester.
The day set, when our campaign
for funds must come to a close, is
rapidly drawing "ear, and strenuous
efforts are being put forth in every
direction to insure the reaching of
the goal. All the members of the
Board of Directors are out pushing
the campaign in the surrounding
country.

be held as soon as the committee on

SHEAF
[RED LAKE COUNTY
WILL REMAIN WET.
Red Lake county will remain an
oasis in the Red River Valley dry
district, as a result of the county
option election held in that county!
Monday. It is reported that the li
quor men won out by 219 votes.
There were 1,635 votes cast at the
election. In spite of the cold wea
ther, which prevailed on that day,
nearly every voter in the county
turned out to cast his vote.
There are seven saloons in the
county, five at Red Lake' Falls and
two at Plummer. The population of
Red Lake county is composed very
largely of the French nationality and
in that respect marks a great con
trast to that of the other counties,
which have gone dry in this state.
Few Irish, German or Scandinavians
reside in the county, it is alleged.
ANGUS TO HAVE A
BANKING HOUSE.
Angus is to have a bank, to be
known as the Farmers State Bank of
Angus, the incorporators being Ans
gas J. Pederson and Melvin Nette
berg, of Angus, and Otto Bremer, of
St. Paul. The new bank will have a
capital of $10,000. Angus is a hust
ling little village in the heart of a
prosperous farming community and
the new bank will fill a long felt
want.Crookston Press.
Another Business Change.
Nels Sveen has bought the Lind
holm building on the east side and
will move his lunch room business to
that location. Ole N Nelson will
improve his building vacated by Mr.
Sveen and will enter into the retail
furniture business. Mr. Nelson has a
wide acquaintance as a business man
and proposes to cary an up-to-date
and complete stock of furniture that
will be sure to attract the trade.
CONSOLIDATION IN BRISLET.
A consolidated school in town of
Brislet wou^d imnro^e school cona
tions greatly in said township. A
the situation now stands the taxpa-*
ers are supporting three schools ?^d
two teachers. If_they should build a.
better"fypljf~scTio6l as the ono at
Boxville, or a four roomed building,
the stat would pay one fourth, not
to exceed two thousand dollars, the
district paying the rest. The school
couM be so located that two drivers
could easily handle the transporta
tion of pupils to and from school, the
drivers receiving six cents per mile
per pupil. Two or four teachers can
teach better or cone more success
fully with little difficulties, that al
ways arise in schools, than one teach
er can working
alone. They will
have more time also to spend on
each individual than whon his or her
work is crowded into little five or ten
minute periods. The work could be
better divided, more time given to
each recitation and teachers could
supervise work and play with a great
deal more of satisfaction to them
selves and to their patrons
than
when working- alone.
Patrons seldom visit our one room
school and inspect the work of their
children, unless there is a program
to hear. The one room school is not
so well lighted or ventilated but if
we had a well lighted, ventilated and
comfortable school of two to four
teachers, the patrols would all be
glad to come and visit at least once
a year and discuss work with the
teacher and see how their children
are progressing in their work.
Let us all boost for a Consolidated
school to be constructed in Brislet in
the summer of 1916.
