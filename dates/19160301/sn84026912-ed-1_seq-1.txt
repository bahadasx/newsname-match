On Monday, March 6, a represen
tativo from the dairy division at
Clemson College -will be in Oconee
county to consider establishing a
cream route. The route will bo
placed in tho section where the
greatest number of cows are found
and where the largest proportion of
farmers want the route.
Farmers, if you are Interested in
this route, write me before March 6
and I will ask the representative to
visit your section.
Routes were established in Pick
ens, Anderson, Greenville and Spar
tanburg counties more than a year
ago and have proved to be profitable
to the farmers.
Eleven Oconee farmers are ship
ping cream and others will begin
this spring. One Oconee man says:
"No man can sell me fertilizer this
year. My cows solved that problem
for me."
We have too many people wanting
our help to wasto time whore people
are not interested. Write me at
once If intorested.
G. M. Barnett, County Agent.
Westminster, S. C.
Editor Keowee Courier: T asked
tho dalry division to send a man to
help mo with the cream route work,
as all of the adjoining counties have
two or more very successful routes,
and I feel that it will be a groat help
to tho farmers If established. Hughs,
Brandt, Harbort and Morton are
shipping cream from Walhalla.
Tho advantages of this line of
work in connection with farming
are: Ready market for all feed rais

GERMANS MAKE FEARFUL DRIVE
Against French Fortifications Before
Verdun-Severn! Captures.
Dispatches from the Western fronit
in the European war indiicnte con
siderable gains by the Gormans In
their fearful drive against the forti
fications protecting the Important
town of Verdun, which is thc center
of supply activities for tho French
forces engaged on tho Western front.
Several of the 20 or 25 fortiftcatlone
between the German entrenchments
and the great forts at Verdun have
been taken by the Gormans, who are
said to have between half a million
and 760,000 men massed on this
front. Accounts vary ns to the rela
tive sizes of the besieging armies
and those of tho French defending
the fortifications. The latter's
forces are estimated at between
350,000 and half a million. The
losses are the heaviest reported in
any battle of the war, both the Ger
maais and French admitting n terri
ble slaughter. The German dis
patches say that their losses, while
very grteat, aie not heavier than the
gains made ita territory taken and
losses inflicted on the enemy war
rant.
Dispatches this morning from the
French side indicate that the Ger
man drive has slackened in intensity,
from which the d?duction ls made
that search Is being made by the at
tackers for weaker spots in the de
fense, than they hlave so far attacks-1,
and that reinforcements aro being
brought up. The battle about Ver
dun is generally taken to be one
fraught with possibilities of a very
decisive nature, either as indicative
of the final succesb of the Germanic
forces, or the establishing of the fact
that the alJdes on tho West cannot be
permanently shaken from their de
fensive lines. Both Russia and Italy
have inaugurated offensive actions
designed to prevent the removal of
Austro-Gorman forces from those
quartette for assistance in the West
against tho French, or possibly to
develop such serious- proportions as
to cause the withdrawal of men en
gaged in tho West for Austro-Ger
mnn defensive work on the Albanian
and Russian war fronts.
The drive against Verdun1 has been
in progress for a week, and it seems
moro than probable t'hat another
week or ten days will bo required be
fore anything Uko a definite idea of
concrete results can be intelligently
formed.
Dispatches from Washington an
nounce that Germany has refused to
accede to the United States' demand
that trans-Atlantic liners, whether
armed for defense or remaining un
armed, bo warned by the German
and Anstrian naval forces before be
ing torpedoed. These powers AV!ll,
they assure our government, seek to
ascertain which ships are armed for
defense, but no armed passenger ship
or freighter will be warned of attack
unless advantageous ito the Germanic
allies to do so, -while no assurance
can be given of safety even to un
armed merchantmen willie some of
the liners go armed. The situation
as between our government and Ger
many is sortions, birt President Wil
son still 'hopes for an early and sat

without the unpleasantness of the
severing of diplomatic relations.

STEAMER SUNK RY MINE.

and sank within half an hour two
milos off Dover to-day. More than
4 0 persons woro drowned or killed.
Tho Maloja left. Tilbury yesterday
from Bombay with mails, 119 pas
sengers of all classes aboard and a
crew numbering about 200, most of
them Lascare. Other passengers
were to board the ship at Marseilles.
Tho steamer was opposite Shake
speare Cliff when an explosion shook
her from end to end. She listed im
mediately tu port. 'High seas were
running and the captain tried to run
her aground, but the engine room
was swamped and the ship became
unmanageable.
The plight of the vessel was ob
served and dozens of cratf went at
full speed to her rescue. One of
them, tho British tanker EmprosB of
Fort William, of 2,181 tons, struck
anotiher mine and sank nearby.
Aboard the Maloja everything pos
sible was done to get the passengers
and erew off. All the boats had al
ready boen swung out before she
struck, as a precaution against the
accident, and all those aboard had
sufficient time to put on lifebelts, in
structions in the use of which had
been given the previous evening.
Boat after boat and a number of
rafts were sent away, but several
persons leaped Into tho water and
?were picked up by the surrounding
craft. It was at first thought all
'had been saved, but later bodies
were washed ashore, and their num
ber was gradually added to during
the day. -
Owing to the fact that Dover is
under strict military law it was pos
sible to obtain only details from
those rescued. The^captain said the
passengere and crew behaved splen
didly.
The passengers wore for the most
part British officials In the Indian
service, the most prominent being
Judge Oldfield, of tho Indian High
Co\irt. Only one of the crew of the
steamer was drowned.
Up to midnight the bodies lamded
from tho Maloja included 18 men,

BABY AV KKK AT SENECA.
Dr. Hines Will Address Mothers
Mooting To-Morrow, March 2.
Seneca, Fob. 29.-Special: Ono of
tho developments of the profound
and growing int .went in the welfare
of babies during the past few year?
is the "Blaby Week." The baby
week campaigns, which have been
held in many cities aro primarily ed
ucational; theta' purpose Is two
fold: Ernst, to give to the parents
of tho community the opportunity of
learning the facts with regard to tho
care of their babies; second, to
make known to tho community the
importance of Its babies, the special
facts relating to tho babies of the
community, and need of permanent
work for their welfare.
Health authorities unite In saying
that public interest is now needed to
put into operation methods foe in
fant welfare which aro well ascer
tained and testod. Tho observance
of "Baby Week" is an expedient for
securing attention to the facts about
tho needs of babies which are well
known by scientific authorities, and
which, if popularized, will greatly
reduce the loss of Infant life through
out the country.
Tho plan for the nation-wide
"Baby Week" was proposed by the
General Federation of Women's
Clubs, and with the co-operation of
the Child's Bureau o? the U. S. De
partment of Labor, State Board' of
Health and other voluntary agencies
the success of this movement is as
sured..
Seneca will take part in the na
tion-wide Baby Week campaign. The
program for the week will he on a
simple scale, for plans are being
made for a ohlild-welfare conference
to be held during tho chautauqua
next summer and nt the same time
to have a child-welfare exhibit; for
it is believed that a conference hold
at that time can be moro successfully
conducted and moro far-reaching
than at tho present.
On Thursday afternoon, March 2,
at 4 o'clock a mothers' meeting will
be held in the school auditorium.
All tho ladles of tho community are
cordially invited to attend. The
principal address of tho afternoon
will bo delivered by Dr. E. A. Hines.
It ls earnostly hoped that every mo
ther in tho community will take ad
vantage of the opportunity to hear
this splendid address, for Dr. Hines
has made a special study of in Hants
and children, and being a physician
of wide experience, will have much
to say that mothers cannot afford
to misa. Several other short talks
will be made, followed by a general
discussion, and a short musical pro
gram.
The other features of the week's
campaign will bo appropriate ser
mons by the local pastors on Sunday,
and special exorcises bearing on the
subject will be conducted by tho
teachers In the public school. The
county papers will bo asked to co
operate by printing articles on tho
subject.
