During its v ,-ry curly days

a trip upon Arkansas' now lead?

the proverbial "slpw train'' in
which he was t'tuviding. Oil
the contrary lie was very much!
concerned at the irctiitiiidou?
lato of speed ;it which It round?
ed the sharp curves lor which
thai road is famous. He was
little consoled, however by the
calm manner in w hich a fellow,
passenger across; the aisle sur
veved the whirling landscape.
Finally, unable to control him
self longer, the novelist h-aneil
across the swaying car and in?
quired :
"Say , don't you think (his is
a bit reckless?going so fast?
What if we'd inct another
train around one of those
curves)"
??No feah of that, suh," as?
sured the culm one. "We've

University Men Earn luliica
t ion.
i 'harlot t es v ii lo, Va., Fob. 24,
I'wo hundred and fifty men
at tin- University of Virginia
have reported the amounts
eaiied by them for tin.- purpose
of piling their ways through
the university. The amount
barnt'd by these men before
entering the university wart
;l7.-lo; after entering tlio
amount was $41,052. This
makes the surprising total of
?-- s'.e.', an average of $U52.35
for each man.
The striking fact is that tho
students who have so far re?
ported have earned for the pur?
pose of getting an education,
nearly nine thousand dollars
more than the total State ap?
propriation for tin- maintenance
of the university, exclusive of
the fUttels set aside for tho bos
pital.
These figures are taken from
a considerable mass of statistics
obtained concerning self-help
at the University of Virginia,
now being digested with a view
to future publication in detail.
The information has been col?
lection by the committee on
student self help, appointed by
President Alderman. T h e
chairman of the committee is
Dr. Ivey V. Lewis Miller, pro?
fessor of biology.
