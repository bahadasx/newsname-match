THE ENTIRE NAV
SYSTEM AT FAULT
ADMIRAL WINSLOW CITICIZES
WORKINGS OF SYSTEM BE
FORE COMMITTEE.
WOULD TAKE FIFTY YEARS
Without Radical Changes Would Take I
long Time to Produce Efficient
Fighting Force.
Washington. - The United States
navy's whole syftem of government
and operation, from edueation of offi
cers to questions of ship and gun con
struction, was sh.,ply criticised before
the house naval committee by Rear i
Admiral'Cameron McR. Winslow. com- I
mender-in-chief of the Pacific fleet. 7
Without radical changes, the admiral t
declared, a fully efficient fighting I
force comparable to the British navy t
could not be produced in 50 years. t
The witness said the system of j
education at Annapolis Naval Acad
emy was wrong and urged restora- 1
tion of the old grade of midshipmen in; t
the fleet. .Boys should enter the ser
vice at from 14 to 16 years of ags. he f
said, spend two years in preliminary c
schooling ashore. then go to sea to ac
quire the 'sea habit" from actual con
tact with things of the sea before com
pleting their educations ashore- t
The polytechnic education now
given midshipmen at the Academy is
utterly unsuited. the admiral eclared. i
to the training of men to handle ships
and combinations of snips at sea. He
could see no value to be gained from
making all navy officers experts in
higher mathematics, and thought con- t
structors, engineers, and c-rdnance ex- f
pe-ts, should be trained as specialists t
and never be called upon to command a
ships. s
From the days boys entered the c
academy, he said, a system of selec- !
tion should be applied to govern pro- t
motions, eliminating men ur.ted for b
the daring. nerve-racking tasks that t:
would be theirs in. war. He 'added r
that fellow officers should determine o
these qualifications and that a plan s
of this sort was being worked out by n
the navy department. s
With two opposing fleets sweeping a
toward each other over the sea for,
an action to be carried out at a speed
.Qf . 20 knots or more, the admrial' in
sisted, there would be no time .for
hesitation by any ship commander. He F
told of how he trained a squadron of
four dreadnaughts he commanded two
years ago until-his orders were carried t
out within six seconds of the time he 1:
gave them. 60 manuevers being carried f
out in a single forenoon.

which began several days ago with C

sound of them has penetrated east

ACTION IS TAKEN TO PREVENT
FIRES IN FORTY-FIVE CITIES
AND TOWNS.
PROVIDES FOR INSPECTION
Requires Permits For New Buildings
and Many Other Things That Will
Have Good Results.
Columbia.-Proceeding - under the.
- "nown as the fireman's fund act
,a.+-ed two years ago 45 citis and
towns in South Carolina have adopted
building and inspection codes which
have been approved by the state in
surance commisioner.
The following cities and towns have
adopted building codes: Abbeville,
Aiken, Anderson, Bamberg, Belton,
Beaufort, Bennettsville, Bishopville,
Blackville, Camden, Charleston, Che
raw, Columbia, Darlington, Dillon,
Easley, Florence, Fort Mill, Gaffney,
Georgetown, Greer, Greenville, Green

Marion, McColl, Mullins, Newberry,
North Augusta, Orangeburg, Rock
Iill, St. Matthews, Sumter, Seneca,
Spartanburg, Timmonsville, Union,
Walterboro, Winnsboro, York.
Commissioner Mr Master expresses
the opinion that few things done in
recent years in South Carolina 'will
result in greater good to the people
than these building and Inspection
codes.
"These codes. contain approved
plans for fire prevention," said Mr.
McMaster. "The striking features of
the codes are the inspections of all
buildings in the towns. These are to
be no less than quarterly inspections
of buildings and premises in the fire
limits and at least one annual inspec
tion of all of the buildings and prem
ises In the towns. Before new build
-ings may be erected or old buildings
repaired, permits must be secured, de
fects in buildings must be corrected,
unsafe buildings are condemned-, only
certain classes of buildings may be
erected in the fire limits, there are
certain prohibited occupations within
the fire limits, the construction. of
buildings are regulated, the construc
tion of chimneys, flues and arrange
ment of stove pipes, steam pipes and
heating appliances are regulated, elec
trical inspections and installations are
provided, proper exits in all buildings
to be used for public purposes are pro
vided; and the storage of ashes, oily
rags and Inflammable liquids is regu
lated.
Each town is to have Its inspector
and these inspectors are to report to
the municipal authorities and to the
insv-ance commissioner. Great good
is expected to be derived from these
provisions "
Fire C ;ms Three Buildings.
Union.-Fire destroyed three very
valuable residences on Main street
and severely threatened several others
The fire broke out in the McCubbin
residence, occupied by Mr. Sullivan,
and spread to the residence of Capt.
E. L. Clarke, thence to the residence
of Dr. S. S. Linder. All three houses
were totally destroyed. A consider
able portion of the contents of Capt.
Clarke's house was saved, but almost
nothing from the other two.
Clifford seminary, just across the
street, blazed up several times but by
prompt action was saved although con
siderable damage was done to the fur
nishings.
Spice and Pickle Factory.
Greenville,-A pickle and spice fac
tory will be established in Greenville
In the next few weeks, a company of
local capitalists having been formed'
for that purpose. It is learned that
the idea being to destribute the pro
duct over the Southern states. -
Inspect Powder Mill Site.
Greenville.-A party of men repres
enting the DuPont Power Work has
spent several days here inspecting a
site for location of a mill here. It is
understood a site was chosen near the
base of Paris Mountain.
Interest York in Artfilery.
York.-Owing to the fact that there
are only three companies of coast
artillery in service in South Carolina,
the present three companies are anx
ios that a fourth be formed. in order
to complete a battalion. With that
end in view Capt. F-enry C. Moore of
the Gaffney organization wrote a let
ter to a York newspaper asking what
the probabilities are for organizing a
company here. The young men of the
city seemeed to take an interest in
the letter, and it is possible that a
company will be formed.
Oppose Compulsory Training.
Detroit. Mich.-The department of
superintendence of the National Edu
cational Association at its closing ses
sion here went on record as opposed
to commulsory military training in the
public schools. The educators, how
ever. favored a plan whereby the
"American youth" who wishes to re
ceive military instruction can find spe
cial schools available. The action of
the department was generally regard
ed as a comnromise between advo
cates of a strong military system of,
Ipreparednfess and opponents of such.

fILING Tf NEEDS
Of TII[ SITTING KEN
How to Use-Hatching Pen and
Nest Boxes and How to
Manage The Fowls.
The care of sitting hens is made
easier and successful hatches more
certain when the -sitters are confined
in a pen away from the layers. The
floor of this hatching pen should be
earth, dug up and moistened. . N
boxes should be placed about
sides. There can be from 25 to 30 sit
ting hens in a pen. For the nest a.box
12 to 15 inches square and about the
same in height is suitable. Remove
the top, front, and bottom of the box..
Cver the top with a burlap sack to
provide ventilation cad nail a wooden
strip 4 inches wide across the front.
at the bottom. Have a wide board
to lean against the open front and i
brick to keep it .in place when It is
necessary to confine the hen.
Fill the bottom of the box level
with the top of the 4-inch board with
moist garden soil argi hollow the soil
like a saucer, so that the eggs will not
roll away from the 'hen and become
chilled. The surface of the earth
should be smooth and 'hard to- allow
the eggs to roll. Cover the earth with
a very little straw and put in a few
common eggs.
DOUSLE NEST f. SITTIN NEN
Remove the sitting hen to the new
est at night. Dust her with yellow
nsect powder or grease a small space
n the skin below her vent with a
iece of 33 per cent. mercurial oint
ent about as large as a pea. This
s for lice prevention. Place the hen
uietly on the ne'st and shut her in.
he next evening, when it is growing
ark, dishes of whole grain and -water
hould be placed in front of the nest
nd the hen removed to feed. Leave
er alone and do not return until
ight. If the hen is then on her nest
nd contented, she may be given the
sitting of eggs you have selected for
er.
Feed sitting hens at the same hour
very day. Give them whole grain
whole corn is best) In a dish, letting
hem eat all they desire. Even un
der the most favorable feeding condi
tions, a hen 'will lose about three
ourths of a pound in weight durig
the three weeks of incubation. If there
re many sitters in the pen, it is be3st
o feed seven or eight together, re
oving any that do not leave their
ests. Replace the hens after 20
inutes. The doors of the nes~ts are
closed except at feeding time. Ex
mine the nests while the hens are
feeding and If any eggs are broken
ash the other eggs in warm water
and clean the nest. Moisten the
earth about the nest frequently. On
the eighteenth day of incubation. Im
eerse the eggs for two minutes in
warm water (106 degrees F.) This
softens the membranes inside the
shell and results in the hatching of a
reater percentage of chicks.

PUREBRED STOCK IN DEMAND
When Pork Market is Low is Best
Time for tuying Breeding Stock
-Hogs Are Cheap Now.
When hogs are high .there'is a, big
demand for purebred stock. Breeders.
get more money because the 'poi*
value of their hogs makes them inde
pendent of the cheap buyer and be
ause the demand Is sufficient to take
all their stock at good figures.
When hogs are low the demand for
purebred stock falls off, and breeders
re compilled to sell It for less than,
when market hogs are commanding
ood prices.
So when the pork market 'Is low,
when the demand Is least for breeding
stock, Is the best time -to Invest in
purebred hogs. Just now hogs. are
heap and' bree-lers have a surplus for
sale at reasonable prices. And now Is
:he time to "go to It" and stock up
with purebred hogs..
Don't wait till everybody wants
:hem. Get them now and be ready
with a surplus of your own for the
;ime when everybody wants them.
That time will come- as surely as
lght follows day.
