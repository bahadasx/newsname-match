By one present.
There is a,dlsease with young cat
tle in this county, that, so far, has
not been arrested and a number have
iiedlrom its effects. It appears to be
a bowel trouble and locally called
black scours, The-calves begin to de
cline in flesh, show weakness in their
general movements before any symp
tom of bowel trouble is noticed and
most of them prior to active trouble
swell under the jaws. Our local vet
ernarian and the veternarian sent to
thistiounty by the Experiment Sta
tion at Lexington have not, so far.
.been of material good. Its ravages if
not soon overcome, will prove disas
"trious to many small herds as quite a
number of our farmers have lost some
and one man has, up to date, lost nine
good ones with several more affected.
The Experiment Station established
and maintained by the State should
go deeper into this trouble by the
analysis method.
Notice.
All persons holding claims against
the road f und-of Adair county payable
out of the 1915 levy or the levy for any

quested to present same to me for pay

Mr. J. Frank Reynolds, who lives
four miles out of town, was in Colum
bia a few days ago wearing a coat and
vest of a suit that he purchased from
Mr. J. O. Russell thirty-four years
ago. They were somewhat faded,
otherwise they were in a good state of
preservation. Meeting Mr. Russell,
f Mr. Reynolds said, "If jou have an
other suit in stock as good as this
coat and vest have proven to be, I am
ready to buy it." During the thirty
four years Mr. Reynolds has worn the
coat and vest- on Sundays and to all
special occasions.

Charles Winfrey, deputy United
States Marshal, of Somerset, was shot
in the thigh, last week, by Perry
Hays Meece. He had gone to the
home of Meece to arrest him upon a
charge of using the mail to defraud.
We take it that the officer is the same
Charley Winfrey, wha left Russell
Spriegs several years ago, locating in
Somerset. He is well-known in Co
lumbia. Eufus Campbell, who is the Jailer
of Russell county, has been in a low
state of health for several months.
He is a fine citizen, one who has many
friends who are very anxious concern
ing his condition. Before he was
elected Jailer he was deputy Sheriff
and was a very efficient officer. Fa
vorable information concerning his
condition would be gladly received
throughout Russell county.

Isaaq Staples gives his age 70 years.
He enlisted from the county of Buck
ingham, Yirginia, under Oapt. John
Chambers in January, 1780. He was
marched first to Prince Edward Court
House, where he remained a short
time, then to Hillsboro, North Caroli
na, where he joined the regiment
commanded by Col. Holcomb, and in
a few days marched to Guilford, where
he joined Gen. Green. He was in the
battle at that place. From there he
was marcnea to woriorcrs iron
Works, and then into Virginia, where
he remained for some time, and thence
back to Hillsborough.
He afterwards re-enlisted as a vol
unteer in the militia under Capt.
John Clark, by whom he was marched
to Staunton, where he joined the ar
my commanded by Gen. Green, and
remained there until he was honorably
discharged.
William McKinney, aged 74 years,
enlisted from Charlotte county,
Virginia, in the year 1775, under Capt.
Thomas Collier. He was marched to
Petersburg, Virginia, and then joined
the Hallifaxand Meckelberg troops.
They were then marched down to
Jamestown, then to Williamsburg,
then to York, then to Gwinn's Island,
and were stationed there until the
battle .was over, and then marched to
Cherry Point on the Potomac. The
Indians having broken out on the
HoJston, he marched there under Gen.
Lewis to route them, and was station
ed there until the return of a part of
the army which went in pursuit of
the Indians. He then returned home,
and went to Georgia, where he enlist
ed under Capt. Austin "for three
months, duriDg which time he was
ranging and guarding the country
from the outrages and barbarity of the
Indians.
Some time after this he enlisted in
Georgia under Gen. Williamson,
Capt. Logan and Lieutenant Charles
Herd to go to Florida They went
on to St. Mary's river, and there met
Gen. Howe, a continental officer.
"Gen. Howe wanted Gen. Williamson
to give up the flour and bacon to his
officers, and us to draw beef and rice
In their stead,, and the soldiers re
fused," and Gen. Williamson also.
Gen Howe and his officers got mad,
and went off, -and left the army at St.
Mary's river. After some-days, Gen.
Williamson sent men to ascertain how
far the Tories had gone, he (McKin
ney) going with them. After march
ing tpTrout's creek, a distance of
twenty-five miles, they came across
the Tories and British in a half faced
fort; had a scrimmage, and Clark, the
commander was wounded, and they
had to retreat back to St. Mary's'river.
Gen. Williamson then sent Maj Pick
ens, afterwards. Gen. Pickens, back to
Trout Creek, he (McKinney) in the
company, but before they reached
there, the Tories and British had fled
across St. John's river Pickens fol
lowed them as far as the river, and
camped on one side, and the British
and Tories on the other. They then
rejoined Gen. Williamson and marched
ipto South Carolina.
In the spring following he was at
Augusta under Gen. Williamson, when
ihe British took Augusta at the time
of Oakes' defeat at Bryar Creek. He
then received a discharge from Gen.
Williamson, and returned to Virginia.
A few months later he went to Au
gusta and was taken prisoner by the
British, and held four months. He
made his escape and joined Gen.
Clarke upon Little river. He then
went under Gen. Clarke to Augusta,
where fight occurred which contin
ued four days. "He was in the battle
from beginning to end,"
The army then went to King's
Mountain, and in that battle he was
engaged all the time, and assisted in
defeating Gen. Ferguson. They took
a great many prisoners, carried them
up to Bickerstaff, and hanged nine of
them, and after crossing the river Ca
tawba, hung three more, and took the
others on to Moravian town.
He was under the command of
Campbell and Shelby at Kings' Moun
tain. A short time after this, be with
others, joined Sumpter, and went in
'pursuit of TarletoDj but when they
came up with him, he was in compa
ny with Cornwallis and his army.
They fired at them across the river.
They tnen marched up to -Black
Stocks on Tiger river. Tarleton fol
lowed, and was whipped back, and in
a fight Gen. Sumpter was -wounded in
the shoulder. ,'
After reading this declaration we
turned again to the historian Rfdpath
in order to ascertain how this old vet
eran was corroborated, or to what ex
tent he corroborated the account of
the battle of Kings' Mountain as it is
given in the books. Ridpath says in
his History of the ynited States:
"On the 7th of October, white Fer
guson and his men were encampedion
the top of Kings' Mountain, they were
suddenly attacked by a thousand rifle
men led by Col. Campbell: the camp
was surrounded: a desperate battle of
an hour and a half ensued. Ferguson
was slain, and three hundred of his
men were killed or wounded: the re
maining eight hundred threw down
their arms, and begged for quarters.
On the morning after the battle, ten
of the leading Tory prisoners were
condemned by a court martial, and
hanged."
Charles Jones, aged 74, made a decla
ration in the circuit court.
n He enlisted in 1775, from Bedford
county. Virginia, under Capt Capt.
Campbell, 1st Virginia regiment com
manded by Col. Patrick Henry. He
was in no general engagement during
this enlistment, but
was 'in many
common en-
scrimmages against the
emy.
He again enlisted' under Capt.
George Lambert, Col. Beaufqrd's reg
iment. Soon after this enlistment he
was marched to Wilmington, where
he was transferred to the wagon de
partment, in which he served until he
was honorably discharged at Wilming
ton. This old soldier has many de
scendants in this and adjoining coun
ties, embracing Jones, Taylors,
Whites, Staples, Hughes etc.
He was the grand father of Judge
W. W. Jones, of Columbia, and great
grand father of Mr E. H. ' Hughes of
the 1st National Bank.

dren One remarkable incident in
her long lingering before death is be
yondany report of this nature we
have ever heard and that is that dur

curred for fifty-seven days. This
statement is made and corroberated
by undisputable evidence.

A Sudden Death.
-Miss Mattie Moran, daughter of Mr.
J. W. Moran, died very suddenly at
her late home, five miles west of Co
lumbia last Tuesday afternoon. She
was apparently twenty-two or twenty
three years old, and was well-known
in this place, having been a saleslady
in Casey Jones' Store for a number of
months. She spent Monday night
with her sister, Mrs Will Young, in
this town. When she arose Tuesday
morning she complained of feeling
badly, and decided to go to her home.
She came over in town, and to the
residence of Mr, W. H. Wilson, and
from that home her people were not
ified, and Dallas Stotts, a young son
of Mr. W. L Stotts, came after her.
It is reported that she told the boy,
while en route to her home, that she
would not live an hour. She reached
her father's residence about the noon
hour, dying a short time after her ar
rival. A physician was called as soon as
she reached home, but death came
before he arrived; in fact, he was not
ified of the death while en route.
The cause of her demise is not
known, and her death brought sor
row to' many friends, besides her near
relatives
Religious services and burial took

circle of friends being present Eld.

S. H. Mitchell the horses got scared
at some goats, ran off, upsetting the
buggy, throwing the ocsupants vio

was laid up several days.
