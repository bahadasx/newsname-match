Interesting Debate Between
E. F. Hanson and the
Rev. W. E. Baker
An audience of about 150 were at the
Town Hall last evening to hear Edgar F.
Hanson of Belfast, Me., and Rev. Walter
E. Baker in debate at a local option
rally. The first half hour was taken up
by Mr. Hanson, who told of the situa
tion in Maine. The Rev. Mr. Baker said
that the matter was a problem for Ver
mont to deal with, not Maine. The
mayor of Belfast had much to say of
conditions in Kausas and referred to a
letter from a man in Topeka,. Kans.,
whose name lie could not mention and
whose letter he read in a debate at
Montpelier Sunday night. Mr. Baker
then read an article in the Outlook writ
ten by the Governor of Kansas and reso
lutions unanimously passed by the State
Legislature of Kansas sustaining the
prohibition law now in force there. Mr.
Hanson left the platform during Mr.
Baker's remarks and without saying
"good by " to anybody. ; .
A singular feature of the meeting was
the fact that nobody introduced the
speaker. He sought the platform alone
and left the hall alone.
Editor News and Citizen :
The .following questions were put to
Mr. Hanson, the representative of The
Hotel Association of Vermont, by his
opponent, Rev. VV. E. Baker, in the recent
debate in Morrisville on the question of
Local Option. The people of ivlorrisville
are still waiting for his answer.
What is the relation bet ween the Lo
cal Option League ol Vermont and the
organized Liquor interests within and
without the State?

Did not the Hotel men know that they
were building on the edge of a volcano
when they defied the Christian lorces
of Vermont and built their hotels around
their bars? Are we to sacrifice our wom

happiness to protect their dollars?
Is there a wholesale liquor dealer, a
distiller or brewer who is not heartily in
sympathy with what the Local Option
League is trying todoin Vermont today?
Can you tell us a single instance where

ed ( over the State, where will he the
Rrejitest rejoicing should the State de
cide to "Let well enough alone", at tbe
bedside yonder where the fond mother is
planning and praying tor her bov, or in
the saloons and diyes where Hell some
times holds high carnival?
If next Wednesday morning when the
day's activities begin, tile news is whis

that you have beencalled into :he silence,
the crepe flutters Irom you floor and

stained faces, would you rather stand in
the presence ol your God having regis
tered a vote the day before to keep the
saloons open, or be able to say as you
stand face to face with your Judge,
"Lord, I've been a poor stick; my lile
hasn't counted for much: I didn't leave
the world much better than I found it,
but on the last day of my life I did my
part to remove a stumbling block from
my brother's pathway?"
Is it right or is it wrong?
