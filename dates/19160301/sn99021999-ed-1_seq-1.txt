local attacks. Near the village of Doua

encounter and the Germans were
repulsed by French troops.
After Intense artillery fire German

In Lorraine the Germans succeeded in

driven from these positions.
There Is nothing to report from the

"We carried out a violent fire on Be

"At various points on our front In the
Woevre our artillery fire prevented at

being carried out,
"In the Vosges there has been great

says :
"Greater activity has been displayed
by the artillery, especially in the region

in that the court, when it re -
the reason
celved the case and advanced it on sum

diction. There Is considerable satisfaction here
that the attorney general was refused
his preliminary motion to dismiss. His
attempt to stop the trial of the case on
Its merits on mere technicalities has
brought out open protests against using
the official machinery of the state to
fight the people through all the courts.
These are fine, bold words. When, how
ever, we consider the conditions under
which they were used, I am at a loss to
know whether the picture they conjure
up Is that of Ajax defying the lightning
or Falstaff on parade.
"How unfortunate it is that the presi

time that has Intervened during which
the administration has done little else
than not only consent, but actually con

BRYAN FOR WILSON,
SAYS THOMPSON
Little Giant of Nebraska Democracy
Brings Message North from
x Miami.
WANTS THOMPSON FOR JUDGE
(From a Staff Correspondent.)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 29. (Spe
cial Telegram.) New light was
thrown on the vacant federal Judge
ship in Nebraska today through an
interview given to the press by Judge
W. H. Thompson of Grand Island
previous to his leaving for his home
in Grand Island.
Judge Thompson, w ho is the dem
ocratic state chairman of Nebraska,
having just come from Miami, Fla.,
where he had an extended visit with
Colonel W. J. Bryan, aald:
"People misunderstood Mr. Bryan's
position regarding his relations with
the president.
"They differ only on a few principles
resulting from the war. These do not af
fect tholr principal relations. Mr. Bryan
will moat likely be one of the Nebraska
delegntea-at-Iarge to the St. Iiuls con
vention. The entire delegation will be
for the president's renomtnatton. Whether
pledged or Instructed, Mr. Bryan will
probably be among the Nnbraaka delega
tion. wh)ch will be for the Presldenty. a I
man. -
"Nebraska Is for PresfHsht Wilson." '
Oar-Term Flank Disposed Of.
Regarding . the one-term presidential
plank, Mr. Thompson said he believed
Bryan would not raise It against the
president. Bryan believes the pisnk
should be again enunciated In the fit
IxiuU platform, but made applicable only
to a president elected after laws are
enacted putting It Into effect.
That no resolution will be urged by
Bryan in the St. Louis platform which
would embarrass the president or repudi
ate any of his policies waa the substance
of the sentlmiint expressed by Mr. Thomp
son. It Is Mr. Bryan's belief the Wilson
renominatlon Is assured.
Thorn paoa far Jslge,
But what Is most significant Mr.
Thompson presented a letter to Attorney
Oeneral Gregory yesterday when he
called at the Department of Justice with
Congressman Bhallenberger, from Colonel
Bryan, wherein the Commoner respect
fully tailed upon the attorney general to
tell President Wilson that he, Mr. Bryan,
wanted Mr. Thompson to be appointed
to the Munger vacancy.
Above all other things Mr. Bryan said
he believed Judge Thompson eminently
fitted for the place by reason of long
legal practice and faithful service.
In the light of the. Interview which Mr.
Thompson gave out today and the Bryan
letter there was a peroept.-i change of
atmosphere about the Department of
Justice with reference to the Judgeship
matter, and a number of knowing per
sons were put to guessing Just what At
torney General Gregory would do now,
t'p to today It looked very much like
Judge J. J. Thomas of Seward for the
vacancy, but with Bryan's personal ap
peal, and the fact that he will place no
obstacles In Wilson's pathway for noml
nation, but rather help him land the
persimmon. Judge Thompson may read
his title clear to the district Judgeship
of Nebraska, for monumental politics is
being played these days by the Wilson
forces.
Judge and Mrs. W. II. Thompson have
been in Washington for several days.
They have made a long visit to 'the
Ilryana In Miami. Fla. They loft tonight
for Grand Island.

FOR PROTECTION
Resolutions Adopted by Boardi of
Trade Look Toward Solidarity
of the Empire.
FAVOR PREFERENTIAL TARIFF
LONDON. Feb. 29. Great Brit
ain's national eipenditure for the
current year will reach the gigantic
total of 1.509,000,000, according
to a atatement today by Reginald Mo
Kenna, chancellor of the exchequer,
addressing a meeting here of the As
sociation of Chambers of Commerce
of the United Kingdom. Great Brit
ain, he said, had maintained its
credit unimpaired throughout the
war.
The government, he said, was pre
pared to give assistance for the de
velopment of foreign trade in order
to Insure that rivals who were Great
Dritaln'a "bitter enemies." should
not as In the past enjoy control of the
foreign trade.
Sir A. Freeman Firth, president of the
sssoclatlon and chairman.' moved a reso
lution that "tho strength and safety of
the nation lay In Its ability to produce
what Is required from its own soil and
factories.", ,
, 'umpire Instead, of . Jlisttosv
Colonel Hughes of the Rhefflnld Cham
ber of Commerce ssld the entire acreage
of the country could not produce any
thing Ilk the quantity of foodstuffs nec
essary to maintain the natlqn. An amend
ment was adopted substituting ths word
"empire" for nation in the chairman's
resolution adopted.
Mr. McKenna estimated the expendi
tures for the year on England's own en
terprises at 1.179.mo. He said that of
this amount one-third would be covered
by the revenue raised In a full year on
the pre sunt basis of taxation. Hs be
lieved no other belligerent could ehow a
similar record.
The chancellor referred to the relation
between trade and military victory.
"Destroy your trade." he said, "sad
you shatter the very foundation of our
power to make these great advances to
our allies and dominions."
The courage of the nation, Mr. Mo
Kenna Added, "would not fall. England
was prepared to endure te the end."
Fire KesolaHoos Adopted,
The meeting adopted five resolutions
almost unanimously. The only dissenting
votes were csst against the resolution
dealing with the tariff.
The first of these motions was the one
presented by the chairman concerning
the production of Britain's necessary sup
plies within Its own borders.
The second related to the protection of
British industries.
The third wss In favor of the creation
of a ministry of commerce and industry.
The resolution In regard to the tariff
declared In favor of preferential trade
relations with the British empire, recip
rocal arrangements with Great Britain's
allies and favorable treatment of neu
trals. The last of these motions suggesied a
conference with the overseas dominions
on various trade questions growing out
of the war. . '
