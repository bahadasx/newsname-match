|fv«rtheadmifltetratton'Rdeft:
There was little chance of a final
[rote today in either the senate and
house on any of the resolutions re
ferred to by the president in his let
ter last night to Acting Chairman
Pou of tho house rules committee.
The president asked for "full public
discussion and action" regarding the
various warning resolutions.
The preliminaries before the final,
vote are expeoted to take several
days. It is believed the final roll
call will not be reacned before next
week.
Today at the president's request
Senator Stone, chairman of the sen
ate foreign relations committee Sen
ator Kern, democratic leader, and
Chairman Flood of the house foreign
affairs committee conferred at the
white house regarding action on the
president's request.
WASHINGTON SEETHES WITH EXCITEMENT
Capitol corridors seethed with ex
citement. The president's letter to
Representative Pou created a sensa
tion. Read for the first' time today
by the bulk of congress, factions both
for and against warning Americans
oft armed ships, were amazed.
Speaker Clark, Democratic Leaders
Kitchin and Flood were astounded
over the president's plan. Not one of
the leaders in either senate or house
had the slightest inkling of the presi
dent's determination to force the
Issue.
Jockeying for parliamentary posi
tion upon the final resolution to be
brought up, was the principal business
before both factions.
Warning Resolution Will be Method Adopted,
With Action Taken as Soon as
Possible.
The general construction placed to
day almost uniformly upon the prest
dent's challenge, was that the ad-1
ministration "counted" both houses
and is convinced it has a firm grip
on the situation with enough votes
assured to defeat any resolution re
flecting on the president's position.
If, as the president and adminis
tration leaders confidently believe, a
Earning resolution Is voted down in
the house, a vote in the senate would
not then be necessary.
It also became known today that as
announced last Saturday by the Unit
ed Press, the president then favored
the show down with congress. It was
decided, however, to postpone action
over the week end, resulting in the
present proposal from the white
bouse.
si
on
Agitation was earnestly renewed
today in congress for the president to
appear before congress In executive
session with a special message con
cerning his dealings w4th the central
powers.
Many members said the president
should in fairness give congress all
his information before congress voted
on the subject, republicans especially
objected to voting "in the dark."
Representatives Heflin, Alabama, sug
gested Inviting the president to ap
pear in a secret session.
Irritation and resentment of demo
crats who favor a warning resolution
was scarcely concealed today. Manv
regarded the president's action in
writing Representative Pou, who has
pever figured in the controversy
which' has disturbed congress for a
week, Instead of to Chairman Flood,
Speaker Clark or Democratic Leader
Kitchin, as a slap at these leaders, all
of whom, however, favor a warning
resolution.
Flood planned a meeting of his
committee to draft the resolution
which will be finally brought out.
That it will come from the foreign
affairs and not the rules committee
first, was regarded certain. The rules
committee will be needed to expedite
action with a special rule to bring
the resolution before the house, side
tracking all other business.
Immediate Action.
WASHINGTON, March 1.—Con
gress will act on the president's re
quest concerning warning resolutions
"at once," Senator Stone said today,
following a conference with the presi
dent today. He added, however, that
actual action would not be possible
today.
Senator -Stone, chairman of the for
eign relations committee, Senator
Kern and Chairman Flood of the
house foreign affairs committee, met
the president at 9 o'clock, remaining
until nearly ten o'clock. At this con
ference an agreement was reached to
have votes taken on one of the various
resolutions pending in both branches.
A few minutes later at the presi
dent's invitation, Speaker Clark, House
Democratic Leader Kitchin and Act
ing Chairman Pou of the rules com
mittee, held a second conference.
This was to discuss the working ma
chinery to bring up a resolution in
the house.
Senator Stone indicated no decision
Representative Flood said that a
new resolution would be brought out
by his committee. This will include
the proposal to warn Americans off
armed ships. It was considered at a
meeting of the house foreign affairs

LONDON, March 1.—61x miles east
and northeast of Verdun, the shifting
German attack Is being directed with
great violence against Forts Da Vaux
and De Tavannes.
The teutons are battering French
positions on the JJeta-Verdun railway
with heavy artillery brought up from
Eftain. The French are making their
stand at the railway station of Elx.
The guns of Fort De Tavannes have
beaten back charge after charge by
whole German brigades.
North and south of the railway,
the crown price is smashing heavily
at the French front, aiming to draw
the German net still closer around
the French fortress. The teutons mov

this afternoon.
At the same time Paris gave warn

of new Teutonic drives against Pep

Paris reported intermltten bombard

The French war office paid some
attention, however, to the movement
of German troops near Pont-A-Mous
son, thirty five miles southeast of
Verdun, reporting concentrations of
troops having been dispersed by
French artmery.
Minor air activities were reported
by both sides. The German war of

the bombardment of an enemy sup

Germany would not admit the right of
