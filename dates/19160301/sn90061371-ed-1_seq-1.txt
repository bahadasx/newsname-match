Under the caption "President
Wilson's remarkable record at
a . political weather vane, the
Chicago Examiner, one of the
Hearst newspapers, prints a page
review of President Wilson's
numerous reversals of attitude on
public questions. Concluding
the Kxaminer says:
"To sum up the evidence of the
only witness we have cited, who
is Woodrow Wilson himself, we
find that
"President Wilson was in favor
of a single term. Now he is
against it. , '
; 'President Wilson was in favor
of, the Garrison Con! inental
Army plan. Now he is against
"IVe-sident Wilson was opposed
to increasing the navy. . Now he
demands that the navy be. made
the largest in the world.
'President Wilson was oppes
ed to young men spending time
in military training. Now he de
mands that 400,000 b trained.
"President Wilson was oppos
ed to a tariff commission. Now
he demands a tariff, commission.
"Prenident Wilson favored in
tervention in Mexico, and did
send thearmy to intervene. Now
he declares that whilo he is Presl
dent nobody shall interfer in
Mexico. ' fc .
"President Wilson demanded
Uiat all the Mexican claimants
get together in a conference to
sUblish a de facto governsient,
and threatened non recognition
of any who refused. President
Wilson then recognized as the
Mexican ruler the only claimant
who did sot, aud would not, join
o the conference.
President Wilson was In favor
of freu Panama canal tolls. Af
Ur his election he compelled the
Democratic majority to repeal
lb free tolls law.
President Wilson wanted to
knock Bryan Into a cocked hat,'
aud when elected made him his
chief official adviser.
President Wilson was out-
spokes against labor union.
Since his election he has sudden
ly courted labor anion Isadora.
President Wilson was oppoa
4 to the initativeand referedsm.
Then he declared in favor of it-
ince thea he has forgotten it.
"President Wilson was out and
out In favor of free trade on theo
retical grounds. Now he says
he doesn't care anything about
free trade theories.
President Wilson is for wom
an suffrage In New Jersey and
against woman suffrage in Wash
ington. "President Wilson wss oppos
ed to prepsrdness as lste as last
year. Now he ia preaching pre
paredness fervently..
"President Wilson was pledged
te protect American lives and
properity in any foreign country,
Mexico inoloded. New he asys
it Is 'none of our business' what
happens in Mexico.
We leaveto President v uson s
apologists the task of reconciling
so mans- contradictions.
"To ns it seems that president
Wilson has no fixed principles or
eonviotions upon any subject un
der the sun, and that he is con
sistent only in advocating any
thing tliat promises to promote
his re election and bia personal
ambitions"

We have personally been re
