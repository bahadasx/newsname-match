Without lessening of the activity of
the contending forces to the north of
Verdun, tlie French in thp Wooviv
region, east of Verdun, are using their
artillery to break up German prepar
ation for further advances toward
tin- fortress. At various points the
fire or the I' reni n guns has f,revente.)
tlie Germans from launching offen
sives. In the Voskos mountains there iiIho
lias been groat artillery activity by
the French near Senones and liun-de.
Sii (it ; while near Heppois the Germans
have been driven out of trenches they
had previously taken. In the Cham
pagne, German fortified works in the
region of Hill 1!3 have beep battered
by the French guns and the crater of
a mine exploded by the nermann was
occupied by the French.
Germans Take Tu Towns.
The Germans have added several
additional poliits to their terrain in
the fighting- about Verdun, having'
been enabled to construct trenches on
the slopes north of the Cote-du-Foivre
and to capture an armored work
northwest of Douau merit, and have
taken the towns of Manhuelles and
Champion, thirteen miles southeast
cf Verdun.
In this drive to the east of Verdun,
the auvanco of the (Jermans was ex
tended over a front of virtually twelve
miles from Dieppe to Champion.
Iterlin reports that thus far they
have taken prisoner 22 S officers, 16,
."7r men, and a largo number of puns,
machine guns and much war inuiciinl.
There has been considerable artil
lery activity and fitfhts in the air be
tween battalions of German and Brit
ish aviators, along the liritish front
in France and Belgium.
Russians Smvessful.
In the Dvlnsk region of Russia, the
Russians have driven the Oermans
hack and advanced their line, and
pat down under heavy fire an attempt
at a counter-attack.
In a lengthy statement in reply to
an official communication issued from
Constantinople, the Russian general
staff describes the powerful defenses
which guarded Erzerum and declares
that the force of the blow felt bv
the Russians can be estimated by the
fact thut some of the Turkish army
rorps of three divisions each now
number only a few thousand men, all
tile remainder either having perished
or been taken prisoner.
Details are lacking concerning the
disaster to the French auxiliary
cruiser l'rovince, which has been lost
in the Mediterranean.
While the French ministry of
marine estimates the number of sur
vivors at fs 70 no estimate Is made of
the casualties.

j Washington, Feh. 2!). An explana-
tion of the various charges against
Louis D. Hrandeis now being inves
itigated by a senate committee eonsid
jerlng his nomination for the supreme
court was begun today by Kdward F.
I MeClennen, of Boston, a member cf
Mr. Hrandeis' law firm,
j Mr. MeClennen took the stand after
Aloert K. riilSDtiry, loriuer aiioiii.-.y
general of Massachusetts, and Edward
W. llutehins, vice president of tins
lioslon liar association, had testified
that Mr. Hrandeis had a reputation
for not being straight -forward in his
dealings. Austen G. Fox, counsel for
the opposition, put In evidence a
photographic copy of a check for $10
from K, F. McSweeney, of Boston, to
Mr. Hrandeis, to support a charge
that Hrandeis wa,s yiaid by policy
holders of the Equitable Life Assur
ance society for representing- them in
their protective association.
Relation to the Kipiitablc.
Mr. MeClennen said the Itrnndeia
firm was first employed by the Equit
able In 1901, and had handled thirty
or forty cases for it since that time.
"So von wero counsel tor tne kuiiu-:
able at the time in ID "5 when Mr.
Hrandeis attacked it in a public j
speech?" inquired Senator Works.
"We were not general counsel nt
any time; we only acted in specific
suits," responded Mr. MeClennen.
"Did the company ever complain of
the speech?"
'Not that I ever heard about."
The witness stated that Hrandeis
acted without pav as counsel for th
nnliev holders, who had their organ
ization headquarters in his office and
many of the reforms urged by them
were adopted by the company. j
"Una. about this .Monweenev
cheek?" inuinrcd TVtleral
rtnrney !
Anderson representing the committee.
Ten IKdlars for Advice.
'Oh. that had nothing to do with
the protective association," was the
response. "Mr McSweeney consulted
about taking- the sur-
render cash value of his policy anq
Mr. Hrandeis charged him ten dol
lars for his advice."
As to the charge (hat Mr. Hranden
was employed by the New Haven or
others to wreck the New England
railroad, Mr. MeClennen said the of
fice dairy showed that Mr. Brandon
ceased to have any connection with
the litigation against the New Eng
land in June, 191.
The witness began to tell about the
I'nited Shoe Machinery matters, but
had not concluded when, the commit
tee had adjourned. He said that al
though Mr. Brandeis was a director
of the McKny Shoe Machinery com
pany, which went into the I'nited
Shoe Machinery company in D0"),
t,nd dRn-d a circular to stockholders
advisinK the consolidation, Mr. Hran
deis never expressed an opinion as to
the legality of the consolidation or of
the shoe machinery's leases.

i'ashiuf;tnn, Feb. 2!i, Results of
the new Aiistrn-llefmim submarine
campaign against aimed nti-ri han I
rhlps of the entente allies beginning
al midnight are awaited by the I'nited
States with grave concern.
Allhoiigh under their new instruo
lions, Teutonic naval commanders
are authorized to sink without warn

have been told to make sure If pns-j
sible that no American citizens are

has assured the Vnlted States that
the new orders are so formulated
now oruers are so lormuiateu as
to prevent the destruction of rncinv
liners "rn account of their armament
unless such armament is proved."
The attitude of the t'nlted Stales
government, toward the new policy
of Germany and Austria has not been
definitely (leleriuined. President Wil
son today discussed the ub,lect in a
conference Willi Secretary Lansing
and then laid the German communi
cation before Ids cabinet. loiter It
was said thut because the all Impor
tant appendices to the German mem
orandum had been delayed in transit
the state department thus far was
unable to determine whether claims
sit forth by Germany and Austria
in justification of tlielv course would
be sustained.
Grave Situation Possible,
Moreover, it h: irt-yntlicca de
cided whether tlie reiterated assur
ances rewarding- the luture conduct
of submarine warfare, contained In
the German note are of a character
broad eniumh to warrant ucceptan
of the German
proposal to settle
thc
I issues growing cut of the sinking of
the l.usitania. A decision in thai cm-
ed in the mails from Hcrliu nearly
three weeks ago.
Meanwhile, if any American citizen
is injured during tlie attack by a sub
marine on a merchant ship which does
not and has no intention of using Its
armament otherwise than defensively,
a, gravo situation will arise.
The United States stands at this
time as It always done, foi the right
of American citizens to travel with
safely on defensively armed ships. If
the German contentions are sustained,
however, and It is proved conclusively
that a ship upon which an American
may be injured, used defensive arma
ment for purposes of offense It. is
considered unlikely that this govern
ment will take any aelion. It never
has contended that ships committing
attacks or other offensive acts, or
under orders to so conduct themselves
are immune for summary destruction.

Discussed by Cabinet.
This course was decided upon after
today's cabinet meeting', at which it
was discussed and after a week'H
'inlet, steady work nt the eupitol.
Prompt action is desired particularly
in the hniiMv where limitation hati
been most turbulent, and whero
Speaker CI irk predicted 'nntl-admln-istratlon
resolutions, when first in
troduced, would have missed by a nlH-
th'jnrlty of two tu one. There never has
nidi been run nuestion of the administra
tion rontrol In the senate side.
Adoption of the pending resolu
tlotiH would praftlcullv amount to
congressional repudiation of policies
announced and contended for by
President Wilson and S'-oretary Lau
sinir all through the submarine nego
tiations which more than once wero
oi a crisis. Wlih their defeat ami an
affirmation by a majority in congress
of their confidence ilk the president'
course, Mr. Wilson's supporters point
out he will be enabled to continue to
contend for the principles of Interna
tional law and humanity with a unit
ed government behind him and with
th- same force as he did before a
minority In congress weakened his
position more than all the arguments
of tin foreign diplomats with whom
he had to contend.
