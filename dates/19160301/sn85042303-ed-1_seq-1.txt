London, March 1. With the lessen

on the slopes north of the Cote du
I'oivre and to capture an armored
work northwest of Douaumont and
have taken the towns of Manhuelles

sufficient evidence with which to con
vict. Some of the fines have been exceed
ingly heavy, and while the defendants
will all probably appeal and mal e
bond for their appearance before the
criminal court of appeals, it is evi
dent that the jury is going 10 com
pel them to do so at this term of
court.

violating the prohibitory law, and his
punishment was assessed at thirty

GERMANY'S LATEST ASSURANCES
ON SUBMARINE WARFARE NOT
ACCEPTABLE.
WILL AWAIT CONGRESS
Washington Officials Are Now Wait
ing for Congress to Show Its Ap
proval of Foreign Policy of Wilson
Before Taking Further Steps.
Washington, March 1. Germany's
latest assurances on the conduit ot
her submarine warfare, as preserved
by Ambassador Bernstorff Monda,
are not so broad as the United States
desires.
It is indicated that no further steps
may be taken until the admirirtration
if certain that its action w,tl not be
embarrassed by congress.
Assurances reiterated In the latest
note are regarded as not sn complete
as those originally offered, and pend
ing the Lusitania agreement will not
be finally accepted as satisfactory
now.
America to Stand Pat.
Washington, March 1. Itesults of
the new Aust id-Herman submarine
campaign against armed merchant
ships of the entente allies beginning
at midnight last night are awaited by
the United States witli grave con
cern. The I'nited States stands at this
time, as it has always done, for the
:,:.;ht of American citizens to travel
with safety on defensively armed
ships. If the Herman contentions are
snstnined, however, and it is proved
conclusively that a ship upon which
an American may be injured, used
defensive armament for purposes of
offense, it is considered unlikely that
this government will take any action.
It never lias contended that ships
committing attacks or other offensive
acts or under orders to so conduct
themselves are immune from sum
mary destruction.
Thornaby First Victim.
London. March L The British
steamer Thornaby of 1,100 tons, is

crew are believed to have been killed
or drowned. The Thornaby was the

I Herman campaign became effective at
I midnight last night.

President Wilson reiterated
to the leaders that the dissen

the laws of nations and hu
manity and that his negotia
