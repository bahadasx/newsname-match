President Asks Congress to
Vote on Proposals to Warn
Americans off Armed Ships
WASHINGTON, March 1. Presl-I
dent Wilson unexpectedly requested of I
congress yesterduy a vote of confl- j
donee in his stand against Germany's'
submarine policy.
Official Washington gasped when!
the White Hun te made public a letter
in the preslJent to Representative j
ward w. I'ou of Hortti Carolina,
fr
Edward
acting chairman of the house rub s
committee, asking an early vote'' en
proposals to warn Americans off bel
ligerent merchant ships.
Democratic leaders of the hou.su
who have fought for a week at the
president's behest to prevent a vote
on the warning resolution, threw up
their hands In dlmay.
Text of rrodiienrg i.nnt
The text of the letter follows:
"The White House, Washington,

dled under the rule of the house,
only by that committee.

being made Industrious use of In for

Boundaries of New Precincts

Since the establishment of new
precincts In Pendleton and the chang
ing of the boundaries of others, few
Pendleton voters know in what pre
cinct they live and. Inasmuch as this
Is the time when petition nre being

knowledge as to precinct bounds.
Then are fourteen precincts In Pen

leaders DiaOOa situation.
Congressional leaders saw only two
possibilities in the president's attitude.
They were:
Thai the president is convinced he
can defeat the warning resolutions
thereby putting the house on record
In favor of his aggressive attitude to
ward Germany.
Or he Ib convinced congress is not
behind him In his foreign policy and
there he Is prepared to allow It to
take the matter out of his hands.

the contest for the republican nomina

CONGRESS TO GO
ON RECORD OVER
F
Prediction is Made That Wilson Will
be Upheld in His Attitude To
ward German Government.
LEADERS APPROVE THE PLAN
Test or sirengUi Will be Made as to
Whether American should be
Warned or Not ui Keep Off Armed
Merchantmen Letter to I'ou Cutis.
M some Sensation.
WASHINGTON. March 1. Con
gress will soon go on record as to the
administration course toward Ger
many. Leader today approved Wit
son's proposal to Representative Pou
that a test of Btrength be taken
whether to warn Americans to avoid
armed merchantmen. Even while
taking steps for a showdown, some
disbelieve that congress, especially
the house, was willing to support the
president wholeheartedly. Kltchin
remarked causticall. "Faulty obedi
ence bus been very highly developed
In the house."
Stone intimated the resolution
would be limited to an endorsement
of Wilson's course In the armed ship
controversy but not refer to other
phases of his foreign policy. It is be
I lieved congress will back the presi-
dent thus far.
Senators Stone anil Kern and Rep
resentative Flood conferred with the
president this morning for nearly an
hour. It was agreed the test would
be a straight one on the warning reso
lution. Clark, Kltehin and Pou met
the president afterwards.
Flood said after the conference:
"In the light of events, I think there
Is little question I .Jit all members of
congress will support the president."
The president's letter to Pou caused
a sensation because none of the lead
ers had an inkling of the president's
determination to force the issue. Tht
request generally was interpreted a
meaning a poll of the sentiment of
the capitol showed enough votes to
defeat the rescdution reflecting upon
the president's position. In sending !
his message to Pou. the president
pointed out that foreign capitals might
be adversely influenced by news of
a lack of support for the govern
ment. .He said the stories of differ- i
ences were being made industrious
use of abroad. He favored a test of j
strength Saturday, but decided to 1
: Postpone action.
Agitation was renewed today for
I the president to appear at an execu- 1
tive session of congress with a spec'. I
j al message about the dealings with j
i the central powers, because the re
I publicans object to voting on the j
i foreign question "in the dark."
