IMPROVED
RURAL HOMES
Art Professor Will Help Make So.
Dakota Farms More Attractive
One of the noticeable innova
tions of the present dny is the at
tempt of the universities and col
leges to go outside of their halls
and campus grounds, in an efl'ort
to he of service and benefit, to the
common people. .South Dakota's
institutions see ji to be keeping up
abreast with those of other states
The Northern Normal and ind. In
stitute at Aberdeen and State Ag
ricultural College, Urookings, have
for some time been the leaders in
this kind of work and now comes
our State "U" at Vermillion,
which has established a Dep't of
Journalism as one of its mediums
for extension work. This depart
ment is sending out weekly letters
to the newspapers of the state giv
ing an account of its various en
terprises.
The first one of these letters to
be received by The Press is of
special interest, when one looks
around Forest City a little, and
we hope somebody will get some of
the U's extension work to ramble
this way—just for a joke.
We copy the said letter below
and regret that we are unable to
print them all as they appear,
judging from the four or five we
have received:
"The rural homes of South Da
kota should be attractive as well as
comfortable, says Professor Rossi
te" Howard, of the art department
of the University of So. Dakota,
who since joining the 'U1 last fall
has been devoting timn to the study
of the rural architecture of the
state. He is planning a campaign
of education for rural buildings
that will combine the qualities of
usefulness and beauty and that will
adapt themselves to So Dakota con
ditions. With this end in view
Prof. Howard is working on a ser
ies of stereopticon lectures on rural
architecture which he intends to
give in the state.
"The art department will not
undertake single-handed the task
of developing the rural architec
ture of So Dakota. The depart
ment of home economics and the
college of engineering are giving
assistance on questions of house
planning and the structural prob
lems of house-building. Profes
sor Howard has been getting ma
terial also from Washington and
the east and from neighboring
states where work along these lines
has been done.
"Prof. Howard has recently re
turnd to the U. S. from France
where he spent several years as art
lecturer for the Bur. of University
Travel. An art department, he
says, should not be merelj' con
cernd with pictures. It should get
in touch with the state where there
is the greatest need. He feels
there is a great field in So. Dakota
in helping to plan more attractive
homes."
Another good work to be under
taken by the extension departm't
of the University is a "Survey of
Road Materials" of the State. The
college of engineering is at pres
ent testing materials from different
sections of the state and is propos
ing to undertake a survey for the
definite purpose of determining
the location and nature of So. Da
kota's road materials.
Another rise of nearly two
feet occurd in the river last night
(Wed ), which is the highest the
'old. inb." remembers of, at this
time of the year. The water is
backt up under the Eidnm bridge
and the two new governnin! barg
es are pompleetly surrounded with
water.

The "\va" department" were rail
ed out to extinguish an ineipirnt
blaze at the residence of Frank
Smith. Tuesday, just after dinner.,
the cook tove getting overheated
while the occupants were tempo
rarily out. Fortunately the dam
age was slight. However, owunr
to the condition of the street one
lady uearly turned a somersault in
the excitement. a.- we are informd.
while the fire was practically
ten under control before either
"Fire Chief" Henry Fidam or
the "Hook and Ladder Company"
with their clothes-line rope got
to the scene. What prevented
another disastrously horrid con
figuration was that the river had
raised three feet in the past week
and the buckets were all in good
working order.
ANOTHER
GOOD RECORD
Chippewa Indian Boy is Automobile
Expert
From the '"Word Carrier." of
Santee, Neb., for Jan-Feb.:
Out of the score of nations rep
resented in an automobile factory
in Detroit, Michigan, it remained
for an Indian, Jos. Gillman, a
Chippewa, whose home is in Min
nesota and who is at present en
rolled at the Carlisle (Pa.) Indian
School, to set the world's record
for assembling a car of that make.
He had the machine ready for the
road in two hours and fifty min
utes after beginning work. The
previous record was three e,:r

hospital getting treatment for aj

An examination of the tiles of
The Press since the holidays shows
a record of a snowfall he.-e for
every week from Jan. 12 to Mar.
1st inclusive, with the exception
of the issues of Jan 1M and Feb 23,
almost seven weks continuous
snow, tho not near as heavy as it
was a year ago. Our local proph
et says this means favorable spring
weather—from and after Mar. 1st.
The record a year ago does not
show a continuous period of seven
weeks, which naturally was follow
ed by a later and more unfavora
ble spring season.
Boss Farmer WG Grant was
over from the Agency last Friday
and made a trip out to Geo Com
eau's to inspect some horses and
cattle, with a money consideration,
which George is about to trade to
an Indian named Long Rock for a
quartersection of land. We un

DANGERS OF DRAFT
Drafts feel best when we are
hot and perspiring, just when they are
most dangerous, and the. result is neural
gia, iff neck, sore muscl-s or sometimes
an attack of rheumatism. In such eases
apply Sloan's Linimeat. It stimulates
circulation to the sore and painful part.
The blood flows freely and in a short time
the stiffness and pain lea ves. Those suff
ering from neuralgia or neuralgic head
ache will find one or two applications of
Sloans Liniment will «lve great relief.
The asjoniilnj pain gives way to a tingling
sensation of comfort anc warmth and qui
et rest and sleep is possible. Good for
neuritis too. Price 25c ut your drugisu
