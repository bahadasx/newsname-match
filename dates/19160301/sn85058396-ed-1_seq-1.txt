i The Gorman offensive against Vcr-
dun, which had brought tho crown
'1 prince's armies up to the inner line
; of French defenses, has halted there,
I according to today's statement from
i Paris.
I The lull, which yesterday gave signs
of setting in, now extends along virtu
5 allv the entire front where the des
l pefate strugglos of the past week and
I more have been going on. There were
no other developments at any point
I during the night, the French war of-
flee reports.
51 Unofficial commentators in entente
5 capitals admit themselves at a loss
I to determine as yet whether the Gor
5 man drive has spent Its force or
I whether the pause is simply the pro
! lude to its renewal before tho hard-
won positions at Verdun, or elsewhere
' on this front.
I Possibly significant In this connec-
tlon Is the French official statement
; that there areaigns of German prepar-
) ation behind tho front west of Pont-
j a-Mousson, IS miles southeast of Metz
J and in the Moselle river region.
Apparently the recent German at-
; tack in the Champagne was nothing
J more than a local operation as it has
not so far been followed up.
' Verdun Situation Satisfactory.

Dissatisfied.
London, March 1, 3:28 p. m. To
day, the last day for the voluntary
enlistment In the British army of sin
glo men, showed a steady flow of re
cruits at the recruiting depots, but no
rush to enroll at the last moment as
had been expected. It was clearly ap
parent that there was still a consid
erable number of men outstanding
who would come under the compul
sory act tomorrow.
That the government is far from
satisfied with the result of the com
pulsory act so far Is seen in the reply
of David Lloyd-Georgo, minister of
munitions, made in the house of com
mons today when he said that the
number of exemptions granted under
the tribunal system was causing the
government much anxiety. Steps
were being taken, ho added to revise
the lists of starred and badged men
and to materially reduce the number
of reserved occupations.
"Are civilians prepared to let their
brothers in the trenches endure hard

make small sacrifices of harder work,

same lesson. Firstly, if we employ
less labor, meeting the wants of the
