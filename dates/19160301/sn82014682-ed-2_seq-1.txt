not entirely unexpected resignation ol
Secretary Garrison as head of the -war
department.' It removed much bitter
ness and relieved the general situa
- tion to an amazing degree.
It.yas the evident intention of Sec
retary Garrison to fight until the last
trench for a continental army and in
opposition to a -federalized militia.
This unbending purpose caused great
Irritation among- many members ,of
Congress. This extended in all direc
tions and made certain a prolonged
and' unpleasant fight. It was evident
from the outset that Mr. Garrison's
plan was overwhelmingly rejected, and
would at: the- end receive but few
rtes either In the senate or house.
'.Ms made the struggle seem useless
1 productive of nothing but jJela
. . 1 wrangling. ;
The retirement ' of Mr. Garrison
iv. sde the outlook briber among all
the congressional factions. It became
apparent th?t valuable time would be
faved and the. proposed legislation
would become more nearly con-partiv
fan than was Expected hereto'cre. It
was predicted" on all sides that th'.
'f-ccrctary'a action opened the way for
"?afe and sane" preparedness legisla.

tl.ct previously was inevitable. -
rcllowlcg close on the heels of Mr.
Garrison's resignation, and before his
successor was named, hot fire was
ftarted under Representative Claude
Kitchin, the Democratic floor leader.
1ti3 was for the purpose of making

putting through the prepared

A number of Mr. Kltchin's most val
v:l personal friends were detailed by

duty of breaking the news to Mr.

Nearly all the Democrats agree
. with Speaker Clark that there is no
intention of bullying Mr. Kitchin, but
rr.erely to-bring him Into line and get
