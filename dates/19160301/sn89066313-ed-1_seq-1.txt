SAYS WARWDNT PAY
Prof. Arnold B. Hall Divides
Peace Movement Into
Three Periods.
"A scientific pacifist". 1'rof. Arnold
B Hall of Wisconsin labeled himself
in ia address on "Problems of World
Government" to the International
Polity Club last night.
Professor Hall pointed out that
there have been three periods of the
Ieaco movement, beginning ii the
United States with the formation of
the American Peace Society one hun
dred jears ago. The basis of this
movement was religious, and war was
opposed on purely religious grounds
From 1S."0 to 1SC0 occurred the
period of the hu.nanitarian peace
movement, of 'vhich the anti-slaverj
movement was a part. This had at
its foundation the theory of the broui
erhood of man and extended to the
publication of "The Great Illusion" by
Norman Angell, with which began the
f-cientific. or economic, protest against
war.
Professor ll'ill laid down Hire
premises:
First, that war does not pay,
economically or socially.
Second, that man is a logical ani
mal.
Third, therefore as soon as he real
izes that war does not pay he will
abandon it
Here Professor Hall mentioned the
heavy cost of war upon future genera
tions In taxation and the economic
interdependence of the nation that
makes the victor in war the loser
because of the destruction of his
market. He showed how Germany Is
England's greatest colony for econom
ic purposes
Professor Hall thinks that the
militarists' chief argument works in
a circle. They say that "we must
have a large army to find places for
mir overflow of population because if
they go to other lands they will not
be available for mlli'ary service"
The speaker showed how civiliza
tion had progressed from the small to
the large group, as it has learned that
co-operation is better than competi
tion, and that now we have come to
the largest, or international, group
The problems ot this group are prob
lems of the future, and it might even
take another war before the final les
ion of war's futility was learned
through experience

A REPORTER'S SURVEY

.Shortly after the attack mi XV. C. Martin, the night of Fehruurj 15, the
.Mlssuuriiui assigned a reporter to make a thorough investigation of the
case, with a Tien to discovering the exact facts in tho case and finding, Jf
possible, who were the guilt) persons. This reporter, with the assistance of
two others, interviewed all Hie Jiersous most directly concerned. He was
instructed to report what the) said, without comment of his own. The JIN
smirian presents hK 'Vop)" below, believing It Is a particularl) good piece
oi report lug, both in the thoroughness with which the stor) is told in the
liirni of interviews, and in its ireedoin
part of the writer.
BY WALTER . mum.
(Told the Saturdav night following
the attack, which was on Tuesday
night. February 15 )
On the night ot the attack I had
been to the library. On my way home
I slopped at Lathrop Hall and read
to one of mv friends, C. R. Chambers,
from a volume of Ingersoll's lectures
for a while Chambers is one of my
best friends and 1 frequently stop and
read to him on my wa home from tho
library
I turned down Chestnut from Sixth
street and when about three jards east
of the sarden fence on the north side
or the street I noticed an automobile
on the south side of tho street. There
were no men that I could see they
were evidently hiding in it and I
think the lights were off. It was a
medium-sized car about the size of a
Iluick or Reo larger than a Ford but
not so large as the big, expensive
cars I paid no attention to it. for
there is nothing unusual in a enr
standing in the road
I had passed it when 1 heard a slight
noise. 1 turned and saw a man only a
few feet from me He was of medium
height, and heavy set. I struck at him
with my book a copy of Ingersoll's
lectures and with my note book, ex
claiming, "You poor fools," or some
similar remark. Two others had
now approached and the three Jumped
on me, throwing me to the ground on
my left side, which is badly bruised
now. There are marks of bruises all
over my body.
They put a gag in my mouth and a
bandage over my ejes and carried me
into the machine, which started imme
diately. One man had remained at the
wheel. 1 fought and managed to get
the gag out of my mouth and the band
age off my ejes. I think I recognized
one of the men. I would have to see
him in the same light to be sure. I
let out one good jell and then they
put me gag uacK in my mouth very
tightly and started cutting my hair.
Something was smeared on my face.
It smelted like iodine.
I became unconscious and when I
came to I had a feeling of intense cold.
I found mvself in the ice and snow. I
dragged mjself to a house, but was
told by the man who came to the door
that there were sick people there, and
to leave I then went across the
bridge to the house of R. L. Baldwin.
He and Torbit brought me to Dr.
Shaefer and the doctor said my back
was sprained and that I would have to
have a plaster cast put on it in all
probability. I was then taken to the
hospital. I suffered very much from
the pains in my back and my left leg.
BY R. L. 11 VLDWIX.
Martin came to my house about 11
o'clock Tuesday night, February 15.
My wife and I were asleep and he
woke us up. He came in, walking as
if he were hurt he was bent over
and told us he had been mobbed. His
face was painted red and his hair had
been cut in an irregular manner. He
told us that four men had attacked him
and brought him out here in an auto
mobile. He said he had been knocked
unconscious, bound, blindfolded and
gagged and that he had the gag in his
pocket, but he did not show It. A few
minutes after coming into the room
he walked around and laughed and
joked with my wife and me about the
attack. There was no disorder about
his person.
1 told him that I would go next
door and try to get a buggy or a car
and take him to a doctor. He said he
did not want to do this; that he wanted
to stay out here all night. I told him
that I had no room for him. He then,
asked me If he could 3tay at some
other house around here that night and
go back to town in the morning. I
told him I did not know of any place
where he could stay and that if he was
hurt he had better go to a doctor. I
started to go out and look for a car
and met J. X Torbit in a buggy. He
took Martin to the home of Dr. W. R.
Shaefer. Martin did not give the ap
pearance of one who had been in any
kind of a scrap.
At Dr. Shaefer's we took off all his
clothes and as far as I could see there
was nothing wrong with him at all Doc
tor Shaefer told Martin that he could
find nothing wrong with him. The
only mark I could see on Martin was a
scab on his left leg. While at Doctor
from anj editorial expression on the
Shaefei's I looked through Martin's
coat pockets and there was no sign of
a gag or ropes.
When Martin first told me his name
1 did not know that he was connected
with the Research. AH I know about
the Research is what I have read in
tne Columbia papers and it never oc
curred to me that .Martin had any con
nection with it.
BY Bit. XV. It. SHAEFER.
Martin was brought to my house by
Rufus L. Baldwin and J. X. Torbit. He
complained of pains in his hack and
leg but I could see no external injuries
except a slight scratch on his left leg.
I cleaned the iodine off his face with
alcohol and told him he had better go
to the hospital, as I did not have the
facilities in my home to make a thor
ough examination.
I told Martin that if his back was
sprained he might havetohavea plaster
cast put on it but that there was noth
ing wrong that I could see. He wanted
to stay all night with me but I told
him that he had better go to the hos
pital where they could see if there was
really anj thing wrong with him. When
he came to my house he acted more as
if his leg was hurt than his back. From
his appearance I thought that he had
a broken leg but I could find nothing
wrong when I made my examination.
I did not notice any disorder or mud
about his clothes.
BY DR. MAX MYF.H.
I did not see Martin until after he
had been brought to the hospital. He
complained of pains in his back, but as
far as I could see there were no in
juriesthat is, no external injuries
BY DIf. GUY I. XOYES.
I did not see Martin until the morn
ing after he was Injured. He showed
no external signs of injuries, hut com
plained of pains in his back and leg.
When I saw him there were no marks
of injuries on him.
BY POLICEMIX CHAS. MITCHELL.
I went to see Martin at the hospital
the night he was supposed to have
been injured. He told me that he had
been knocked unconscious in the attack
I asked him to show me where they
hit him. He said, "Well, they didn't
actually hit me, they just shoved me
around." I saw him stripped and
could not find a sign of a bruise or in
jury on him.
That night I went over the ground
where he was supposed to have been
attacked and I went out to the bridge.
I could find no signs of a struggle
any w here or any other evidence. I w ent
to see Rufus Baldwin, and he told me
(Mitchell's account of Baldwin's story
is the same as Baldwin gave the re
porter.). I learned from the garages
that there was not a company car out
that night without a driver. One car,
a Chalmers 36, belonging to west, re
turned to Taylor's Garage at 12 o'clock
that night.
(West's car was searched and no
signs of hair found.)
I searched every car In the garages
but could not find any that had any
hair in them.
BY JAMES LIPSCOMB.
I was in my room at Sixth and
Chestnut on the night of Martin's trou
ble. About a quarter after ten I heard
a shout It sounded like some student
just yelling for fun, as they frequently
do. 1 got up and walked to the win
dow. I then heard another j ell and an
other at least four all together. They
did not sound like someone in pain
but more like some student jelling for
fun. I then went to the door and
looked out and saw a car just starting
on Sixth street. I do not remember
an thing about tho car
BY XATHAX SCTIXECK,
Dumas Apartments.
I was on my way to fire a furnace
the night of Martin's attack. I walked
down Chestnut street about twenty
minutes after ten and saw a car about
the middle of the block on the south
side of the street. The lights were off
and I could not see anyone in it. It
was a medium-size car and rather new.
While firing a furnace a short distance
away I heard several jells, but thought
that they were made by some students
out on a joj--rIdo. I returned home
along Chestnut street and found Mar-

Thefce were borne of the questions put
to Dr. W. i:. Muns, who led an infor
mal discussion on dietetics at the
child welfare exhibit last night.
In answering these questions Doctor
.Mu: said that after tho baby is 12

begin to work In bread, eggs, butter,
and fruit, but very littlo or no meat
and not meat fat. Vegetables, such
as spinach, carrots and beets, should
not be omitted, as they are of great
value. Haw fruit is also good. Plain
cookies, made of butter, sugar and
eggs, may be allowed betwepn meals.
The mother should make them her
self, however, to be sure of what is

In speaking of disease. Doctor Muns
said that pneumonia and tuberculosis
are the most prevalent winter diseas
es among children. In a recent ex
periment It was found that the chil
dren who are exposed to flies are
more susceptiblo to summer com
plaint than those who are protected
from the flies.
I' was found by the committee on
statistics that brorjsho-pneurqpniti
was most fatal among the children
in Columbia in 1915,, There were six
teen deaths from it."

CItc Jubilee Week Address on "A
Workimr Ifo-Hglon."
The second address for the Y. W. C.
A. Jubilee Week at Christian College
was given by Mrs. Turner McBatoe to
days Her subject was "A Working Re
ligion." "The people at the top and the peo
ple at the bottom of the social ladder
have alwajs worked. The present age
has brought a universal conception of
work."
"First, It was discovered that better
results could only be obtained by more
Intelligent work; secondly, these must
be cooperative; thirdly, there must be
conservation or working forces.
"Saint Paul found the secret of ef
fective force in religious activities
when he said we must be transformed,
not conformed. A working religion
must begin at life's center and then
its outer expression -will be effective."
