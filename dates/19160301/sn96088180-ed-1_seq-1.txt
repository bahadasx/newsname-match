Loudon, Mir. l.Tho Teuton pro
clamation of war on armed enemy
merchantmen went into effect at mid
night. Thus far there hove (been no
results. Moreover, . no definite re
port of torpedoing are expected for
Any, or perhaps two, and there la

of the British vessel Thornaby, as
reported to Lloyd's today, was the
first Austro-oerman blow.
The number of aubmarlnea oper-j-f
atlng off Italy la known to have been
greatly Increased lately; probably In
Anticipation of the new campaign.
Through that tone are now passing
everal armed Italian liners legi
timate prey under the new decree.
The situation here Is similar to
that prevailing at the dawn of the
first German submarine campaign
more than year ago. Shipping men
re divided In their opinion as to
what Austria and Grniany;"wlU' do.
Some regard the decree aa a "bluff."
Such persons are offering bets that
no submarine will sink a liner with
out warning.

fleet for a spectacular campaign, are
concerned for the safety of the crews
of merchant vessels and the passen

Great Britain contends tho cam-

v holds, officially, that the Germsns
.Jave distorted English orders, seUed
from csptlve ships, to make It ap
pear that the admiralty has ordered
armed merchant ships to attack sub
marines. Lord Robert Cecil claims that the
distortion arises In construction of a
paragraph of English Instructions to
ships to restrain their fire until a
submarine Is within 800 yards. He
claimed inai mis is a oeiei.ive "
sure, though the Germans asserted It
meant to restrain the fire until the
submarine was within range, so that
the shot would be the more effective.

WILSON POLO
'Washington, Mar. I. Congress
will soon go on record as to the ad
ministration's course toward Ger
many. Leaders today ratified Presi
dent Wilson's proposal to Acting
Chairman I'ou of the house rules
committee of a test of strength as
to warning Americans off armed bel
ligerent merchant ships, and discuss
ed with him - the means of getting
such a vote.
Since it Is the president's purpose
to demonstrate to Germany that the
country supports hltn la the Interna
tional situation, the leaders will
trams the Issue to "bring out that
Idea. '
Even while taking steps for a
"show-down," some leaders Indicated
their disbelief that congress the
house at least Is willing to support
'the president wholeheartedly
Majority Leader Kltchln referred
Ironically to the executive's power
over congress and Intimated his be
lief that the majority of the bouse
favors Issuance, of a warning to
Americans not to travel on armed
ships, In spite ot the president's op
position to such a step.
Speaker Clark has made a similar
declaration, though he mads no com
ment today.
"The faculty of obedience has been
very highly developed In the house,"
said Kltchln.
Chairman Stone, of tho senate for
eign relations commutes, declared he
had foend a rule whereby It Is aot
necessary to obtain unanimous con
sent to pssa resolutions approving
the president's course. ,
Senator Jonea had declared he
would thwart unanimous consent for
Immediate consideration. ,
V Stone Intimated that the resolu
tion will be limited to an endorse
ment of the Wilson course In the
armed ship controversy, and will not
refer to other phases of foreign
policy. '
Thus the administration would
gain republican votes whtch would
not be given to a support of the gen
eral administration policy. '
President Wilson and Congression
al leaders have practically concluded
that a vote on a resolution like Con
sressman McLemore's. warning
Americans off armed ships, would
nest serve the administration's pur
pose. . ,
The president would expect the
house to defeat and the senate to
defeat the Gore similar resolution.
He does not desire a vote of con
fidence or a complete endorsement

Washington, Mar. 1. Support and
repudiation of President Wilson's
Teutonic policies by congress hangs
in the balance.
While the- government gravely
awaits the first Austro-Germaa shot
In the new campaign against armed
enemy merchant ships, the eapltol
prepared today for a ."show-down"
on the Wilson program, as a result
of his request to Representative Pou,
acting rules committee chairman, for
a vote on ths question of warning
Americans from armed 'belligerent
vessels. '. '
Negotiationa wkh the central pow

turmoil over the Wilson challenge.
The administration was confident
that Its hands would be upheld, de
spite the recent claim of Speaker
Clark--that ths house stood two to

There was little chancs or a final

Dorlln, via Wireless to Sayvllle,
L. I., Mar. 1.- "Germany's memor
andum declaring that armed mer
chantmen In the future will be con
sidered warships does not change
pledges Ambassador von BernBtorft
gave the United States, because when
they were given no such thing as an
armed merchantman or liner was
thought of," declared Baron Mumm
von Srhwaorzonsteln, of the foreign
office, to the United Press today.
When Germany made those
pledges, ho said; she never dreamed
that tho British would Instruct mer
chant liners to conduct an offensive
warfare.
"Therefore," he continued, "tho
two Gorman statements remain dis
tinct and separate. , The first, as
made by von BernBtorft, applies to
liners as they should 'be to conform
to International law, not armed for
offensive purposos. The second mem
orandum applies to ships armed tor
offensive purposes, contrary to In
ternational law."
Asked why, In view ot President
Wllson'a letter, Germany will not ad
mit ths right of hostile merchantmen
to arm for defensive purposes, the
baron replied: ' , '

Flood 'said his foreign commutes

Speaker Clark, Majority Leader
Kltchln and Congressman Pou met
the president after his conference and
discussed with him the matter ot
bringing up the resolution. Stone
and Flood plan also to see Secretary
Lansing. '
"In the light of events," said
Flood, "I think there Is little ques

will support the president." '
The letter to Pou caused a sensa

"Well, along . with necessity, the
privilege of arming merchant ships
disappeared long ago, for 'cessante

Itself ceases.)
"This question can take a back
seat, for the merchantmen of our
enemies are not only armed for de
fensive, hut also for offensive pur
poses. This Is clearly proved by Brit
ish admiralty orders that fell Into
our hands. Look at these and you
will see that although, there are
headlines to throw dust in people's
eyes by speaking of defensively
armed ships, yet they instruct mer
chantmen 'not to open fire at a range
greater than 800 yards unless the
enemy has already opened fire,' and
to fire In 'self-defense, notwithstand
ing that the submarine may not have
committed a doflnlte hostile act.' "

Paris uttered a warning, however.
that the Germans probably are pre

French lines.
Berlin reported artillery fighting
along the whole front, bat no Infan

the city Is now directed against Forts
De Vanx and De Tavennes.
The German warriors are battering
the French on the Metz-Verdun rail
way with heavy artillery brought np'
from Etain to the eastward. At De
Tavennea the French have repelled
repeated onslaughts. Teutons from
Dieppe are advancing to DeVaux fort
behind a curtain ot artillery fire.
The French are answering this attack
and holding their positions east ot
Vaux village.
The German ring of Iron Is two
thirds . around Fresnes, 13 miles
southeast of Verdun. Particularly
terrible Is the fight around Man
heulles, which Paris yesterday ad
mitted the Germans had captured.
The French are trying hard to re
capture it and to strengthen their
front around Fresnes. v
Meanwhile the artillery struggle
to the north is Increasing, Indicating
hat a fresh assault is . under "way
against the "Pepper heights."
Artillery roars, in a new outbreak
along the whole western front. Thus
far It Is sot a major offensive, ex
cept around Verdun, and. opinion Is
divided as to whether or not the re
awakening on the entire line is the
perlude ot a general offensive, or is
merely designed toy the Germans to
engage the French, so that they can
not shift reserves to Verdun. '.
Hand-to-hand fighting continues
around Fort Douanmont Bayonet

those slain by the guns. The struggle
is at such close quarters that neither
side can use artillery; ,u
Paris reports that the Branden

Douanmont are surrounded and that
other Germans 'are endeavoring to
relieve them. - ' '
On the other hand, Berlin claimed
Douaumont Is firmely held by the
