Henry D. Estabrook, New York
Attorney, Starts Political
Ball Rolling.
LEFOLLETTE MAY ENTER
STATE IF NECESSARY
Republican State Central Commit­
tee Ticket Receiving' Strong
Support.
North Dakota's presidential prim­
ary campaign opened last evening,
with the arrival of Henry D. Esta­
brook at Jamestown. is pos­
sible that Senator La Follette
may enter that state also.
These are the only two republican
presidential nominees to be balloted
upon. There is every evidence that
the campaign will be quiet. The vot­
ers are not showing very much in­
terest as yet, because political is­
sues have been more or less obscur­
ed by other events, both of a state
and national character.
Senator LaFollette is well known to
the voters of the state. Estabrook
hopes to become better acquainted
after his speaking campaign of sev­
eral days, during which he will ap­
pear in the principal cities of the
state.
Election March 21.
The primary election will be held
in this state on Tuesday, iMarch 21.
There are no very active contests
in the republican ranks. The repub­
licans through their party organiza­
tion have picked a strong ticket,
which is receiving the endorsement
generally of the press of the state,
as the most representative one in
1he field. This tickt appears else­
where in these columns.
Aside from the contest for places
on the delegation to the 'National
'Republican convention, the .contest
between William 'Lemke, Fargo, and
Gundar Olson, Grafton, for national
committeeman, will be watched with
considerable interest.
Jn the democratic party, -.there is.
a real red-hot fight between tlie
Burke-Bruegger wing( and the Doyle^
Duis faction for the' control of the
office of national committeeman. H.
H. Perry of Ellendale has been
brought otu by the Doyle-Duis fac­
tion,' to oppose John iBruegger of Wil
liston. The democrats of the state
are restive' under the dictation of
John Burke and believe that ©meg­
ger' is completely under his control.
They also question Bruegger's loyalty
to Wilson. F. 0. Hellstrom is lined
up with the Doyle-Duis faction in this
fight.
The German Vote.
'One interesting feature to which
the Perry men attach some signifi­
cance is the fact that many citizens
of German birth will enter the re­
publican primaries this year. It is
thought that because of this fact Bru­
egger will suffer a loss of support
that otherwise he would have.
The presidential primaries from a
democratic standpoit will decide
practically whether Burke is to enter
the lists for the senatorila nomina­
tion. If .his ticket triumphs, it is
thought that he will announce him­
self at once. Then F. O. Hellstrom
will file, too, and the factional fight
will be carried into the primaries em­
bittered more than ever.
If the Perry faction wins out, how­
ever, it is believed that Burke will

DISMAL PICTURE OF
'London, March 11.—Lord North
cliffe, who has just visited the Ver­
dun battlefield, in a message to the
Weekly Dispatch, declares that Ver
diin is a great deal more interesting
than important. The newspaper pub­
lisher continues:
"It does no.t need a personal visit
to the battle field to realize this. If
the Germans think that an attack on
the unarmed and dismantled force of
Verdun opens the way to Paris, they
have a very faint notion of French
preparations and French power of re­
sistance.
Comparing the present German
troops with those which fought in the
early stages of the war, he says:
"Last week I saw German prison­
ers who had escaped the hellish fire
of the French 75 at Verdun, where
had gone those splendid stalwarts
captured at the battle of the Rhine
Much of the rank and file now left' of
the Germans is undersized and badly
dressed, faces that bear a look of
strife that seems as if it would last
a lifetime. Their appearance Is such
as to move a heart of stone. With
two exceptions among those with
whom I spoke, all were utterly weary
of warfare, and begged to be told
when peace could be expected.
'The fact about the whole war is
that Germany is in the position of a
belligerent city and she is striking
out blindly by land at Verdun. She
will presently, 1 am convinced, strike
out. by son."
Ship Sank
Near France
No Warning
Lansing Asks for Investigation
Preparatory to Making Demand
in Line With Administration's
Submarine Policy.
Washington, March 11.—Secretary
iLansing today instructed Consul Os
born at Havre, France, to secure and
forward immediately all available de­
tails of the sinking in 'Havre Roads
of the Norwegian bark, Siluis, from
which seven American citizens were
rescued. Consul Osborn had previ­
ously reported that the Silius was
torpedoed without warning on the
night of March 9.
If a torpedo did destroy the bark,
which was bound to l-lavre from Now
York with grain, the government re­
sponsible will be held to strict ac­
countability. Such an action would
be contrary to all the assurances
which the United States has secured.
Officials seemed inclined, however,
to refrain from forming an opinion
until it was known positively that a
torpedo, and not a mine, sunk the
ship.
Should Consul Osborn's investiga­
tion establish that a torpedo actually
was responsible, the United States
officials indicated will view the mat­
ter as even more serious than if a
passenger carrying vessel was in­
volved. The state department consid­
ers that American seamen have even
a greater claim to protection than
passengers. A passenger travels at
his discretion, while a seaman is com­
pelled to do so by his occupation.

LOYALTY TO CHIEF
DOYLE—DUIS SLOGAN
An interesting contest is develop­
ing in the bemocratic ranks over the
selection of a National Committee­
man, the choice now lying between
John Bruegger, present incumbent,
and H. H. Perry, chairman of the
Democratic State Central Committee.
Owing to events of the past few
weeks considerable importance has
attached to the situation, it being
generally understood that Mr. Perry
and his supporters represent the ad­
ministration forces in this state,
while the Bruegger strength compris­
es a reactionary element in the party
antagonistic to the Wilson adminis­
tration. The preliminary steps in
the campaigns of the two rival candi­
dates attracted but little attention.
General Dissatisfaction.
There was general dissatisfaction
over the manner in which the patron­
age had been handled, and the State
Central Committee, acting through its
executive committee and other party
leaders throughout the state, desired
to crystalize this opposition in the in­
terests of some representative demo­
crat whose election to the office of
National Committeeman would secure
harmony within the party. It wns
not until the gathering of party work'
ers at the Democratic Achievement
banquet, held in Fargo February 22,
that the real issue behind the Brueg
ger campaign became apparent. At
this, function Mr. D. H. McArthur, in­
come tax inspector and manager of
the Bruegger campaign, acted as
chairman of the program committee,
and secured as the principal speaker
Hon. J. I. Dunn, of Omaha, Neb., who
delivered a forceful attack upon the
administration policy of prepared­
ness. The violent criticism by the
speaker of the president's policy call­
ed forth interruptions from United
States Marshal S. J. Doyle, and ex
Senator W. El Purcell, both strong
administration men and leaders in
the Perry campaign. This attempt of
the McArthur-Bruegger forces to turn
a Democrat banquet' into an anti-Wil­
son demonstration and a boom for
Bruegger for National Committeeman
has aroused a storm of protest' and
resulted in arraying the party advo­
cates strongly behind Perry and In
support of those candidates for elec­
tion as delegates to the National Con

London, March 11.—Teutonic regi­
ments, by a sudden thrust in the
Champagne at a point where there
have been few breaks in the routinne
of French warfare for several months,
have captured positions over a con­
siderable section of the French front.
The German war office announces
that the ground gained, about two
thirds of a mile deep, along i400
yards of front, and that several guns
and more than 700 prisoners were
taken.
The German offensive l'or the lime
being has been slackened in the Ver­
dun region. Tlie Fronch oflicial re­
port announces Unit there has been
no recent attempts at infantry action
on the part of the Germans along the
whole of the front.
Describing the German attacks on
the French trenches, west of Douau
mont on Friday, the officials state­
ment of the French war oflice says,
that the Germans three times, in col­
umns of four, rushed forward to the
assault, but were mown down by ar­
tillery and machine gun fire. They
were forced to retire, both leaving
the ground covered with dead bodies.
Attack Near Rheims.
The attack was made at a point,
near Rheims, some distance west of
the scene of the last' previous Ger­
man assault in the Champagne.'There
have been no indications thus far
that the Germans have attempted to
follow up their attacks. Apparently,
it was a detached move, similar to
their successful stroke in the Chani
rpaga«?'\-early,.part...if the
Verdyn drive.
Gain At Verdun.
Although the French continue to
offer stubborn defense before Verdun,
the Germans have succeeded in gain­
ing additional ground. Berlin announ­
ces that the French have been clear­
ed from Corbeaux and Cumieres
woods, west of the Meuse.
The German Admiralty reports that
German seaplanes attacked a Russian
squadron of one battleship and five
destroyers off the coast of Bulgaria.
It is said some of the destroyers were
hit.
Casualties 2.500,000.
A wireless dispatch from Berlin
gives a report, said to be based on
information given confidentially by
the French war minister, that French
casualties to March 1 amounted to
2,r00 0.00. It is said that 800,000 were
killed and 1,500,000 wounded, 400,000
severely, and that 300,000 are miss­
ing.
The Portuguese cabinet has resign­

VILLA AT CORRALITOS.
El Paso, March 11.—Villa, with
a band of about 900, was in the
neighborhood of Corralitos, Chi­

Juarez from General Bertani, at
Caloman.
Sail Antonio, Texas, iMarch ll.—Or­
ders were issued at -Ft. Sam Houston
tonight, for the Second battalion of
Engineers composed of companies E,

manding, to entrain. Similar orders
were issued to Field Hospital 'No. 7,
•Major Jerry E'. Clayton commanding,
and to Ambulance Company No. 7,
.Major Harold L. Jones commanding.
No destinations were announced ex­
cept that, those detailed would go
west.
The Engineers detailed comprise
one-third of the United States Engi­
neering corps and the orders to en­
train indicate that heavy engineering
work is ahead of the expeditionary
force.
Each company of the battalion is
composed of from 140 to 150 men.
Ambulance Detail.
The ambulance detail consists of 12
ambulancui. It finished entraining
tonight, but the other details prob­
ably will not be entrained until to­
morrow afternoon.
Ambulance No. 7 will leave before
tomorrow.
Telegraph Company of the Sig­
nal Corps is expected to leave tomor­
row night, and it is said three troops
of cavalry and batteries A, and C.
of the Third Artillery, Major Leroy
S. Lyon commanding, will be entrain­
ed about the same lime.
Army officers estimated it would
take from three to five days for the
three cavalry regiments to reach the
border. While no announcement was
made, the order was construed to
mean that General Funston intended
to employ the four cavalry regiments
now on duty along the border, both
to the east, and west of Columbus, as
part of his expeditionary force, which
it is understood, will bp under the
direct command of Brigadier General
Pershing.
The force would number, if compos­

battalion of mountain artillery, about
4,000 fighting men, exclusive of engi­
neers and other auxiliary troops.

Secretary Baker and his chief sub-

dispatches from Funston and doing
eevrything in their power to back up
his plans. Many of the dispatches
were forwarded by wireless to Presi­
dent Wilson down the Potomac, on.
the iMayflower.
•But whether troops had entered
Mexico or when they might move
across the border, the officials would
not say.
Urges Secrecy.
General Funston himself has urged
that all secrecy surround the move*
ment of troops, so he may have an
opportunity to surprise the bandit
chieftain.
While extensive troop movements
were in progress during the day, the
state department received from Gen­
eral Carranza, the head of the de fac­
to government of Mexico, a request
to send his troops should occasion
arise across the border into the Unit­
ed States in pursuit of the bandits.
The note immediately was forward­
ed to President Wilson on the May­
flower, and tonight he sent word he
would consider it on his, return to
TSie. capluil Muritiay, •mertiittg and then

Agreement Is Remote.
There was every indication that of­
ficials viewed General Carranza's. re­
quest in a favorable light. It waa
suggested, however, that such a recip­
rocal arrangement probably never
would reBult in a single Carranza sol­
dier eptering the United States, for
officials feel that with the. tightening
of the border patrol, the possibility
that any fugitive bandit will cross is
remote.
Funston Arranges Details.
Instructed by the war department
at Washington that he was not per­
sonally to command the troops that
will cross the Rio Grande into Mex­
ico, to search for Francisco Villa, Ma­
jor General 'Frederick Funston today
began to arrange the details of the
expedition, and to plan for the safe­
guarding of the entire Mexican bor­
der.
During the day, the general con­
ferred frequently with his staff at Tt.
Sam Houston, southern department
headquarters. A close censorship
was established, however, on pro­
ceedings. All announcements were
made by General Funston himself, in­
cluding the following information:
"That an officer subordinate to him.
a brigadier general, would command
the punitive expedition.
"That this officer would have com­
plete charge in the field and would
not be hampered by unnecessary in­
structions.
"That it would take two or three
days to organize the force or forces

STRICT NEUTRALITY
Copenhagen, March 12.—lAn official
statement' regarding the conference ot

"The deliberations were opened by
a general con' ersation on the ques­
tions which have occupied the Scan­

after the meeting of the Scandinavian
king at the meeting at Malao in De­
cember, 1914.
"Various important matters, which
have occurred since were discussed
as regards several special questions
of practical interest, and agreement
was reached providing for the con*
tinuance of the common measures al­
ready taken and the new measures to
be taken in the interest of the three
"The deliberations strengthened
the good relation between the three
states, and gave fresh expression of
the desire to maintain a loyal and
