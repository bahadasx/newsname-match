The German offenHive for the time
bring has burn slackened in the Ver
dun region. The French official re
port Announces that there has been no
recent attempt at infantry action on
the part of the Germans along the
whole front.
On the east hank of the Meuse, the
region around Douaumunt is being
subjected to a heavy bombardment but
on the rest of the center and in the
Woevre the guns are not working so
actively and on the western bank of
the Meuse in that section from Hethln
court to the Cntc-de-L'Ole, the artil
lery duel has been comparatively un
important. Retake Corbeau.x Wood.
In that region the, Germans claim
to have retaken most of the C'orbcaux
wood, tho possession of which is likely
to prove a factor in an attack on the
Coto-dc-L'Ole. the G?-ni .ns also hold
ing hill 265 to the northeast of that
important strategic position.
Describing th' Oonnu.i ;otuck...
the French trenches west of Douuu
inont on Friday, the official statement
of the French war office- says that the
Hermans three times in columns of
four rushed forward to the assault but
woro mowed down by artillery and
nmchino gun fire. They were forced
to retire, leaving tho ground covered
with bodies.
Gains In Champagne.
Saxon regiments by a sudden thrust
In the Champagne, at a point where
there have been few breaks in the
routine of trench warfare for sev
eral months, have captured positions
over a considerable section of the
French front. The German war of
fice announces that the ground gain
ed is about two-thirds of a mile deep
along 1,400 yards of front and that
several guns and more than 700 pris
oners were taken.
The attack was made at a point
near Kheinis, some distance west of
the scene of the last previous German
issault in the Champagne. There
have been no indications thus far
that tho Germans have attempted to
follow up their attack. Apparently
it was. a detached move, similar to
their successful stroke in the Cham
pagne dining -the early part of the
.Verdun drive.
(iiiiis at Verdun.
Although the French continue to
olfer stubborn defense before Verdun
the Germans have succeeded in gain
ing additional ground, lterlln an
nounces that the French have been
cleared from Corbeaux and Cumieres
woods, west of the Meuse. The of
ficial French statement sajs the Ger
mans captured part of the town of
Vaux, northeast of A'erdun, but were
unable to reach the fortress of that
name.
The German admiralty reports that
German seai'lanes attacked a Kus
sian squadron of one battleship and
five destroyers off the coast of Bul
garia. It is said some of the de
stroyers were hit.
Ke-jHirl of French Losses.
A wireless dispatch from Berlin
gives a report, said to be based on in-
formation given confidentially by the
French war minister, General Galli
nl, that French casualties to March
1 amounted to 2,000,000. It is said
fcOO.000 were killed and 1,400,000

discerned at present, but Flench mili

Covered by a hail of shell which

pressed steadily forward until late in

That the French later were able to
eject the Germans from this position Is
declared here to be one of those in

in war without affecting the ultimate
success of the operations.

Columbus, N. M.. March 11. Villa,
according to an official telegram re
bcrdcr In the general direction of the
Kl Tigre mining district.
Troopers of the Thirteenth cavalry
which beat off Villa's raid on Colum
bus, Thursday, were fully prepared
today to move into Mexico at a mo
ment's notice and men and officers
chafed at the delay in orders to he
gin a chase of the Mexican insurgent
chief.
The town in contrast to the ner

night,. was calm and quiet when dark
ness fell, and the Thirteenth regi
mental band resumed its conceits to
night. Oaring Feat of Americans.
Col. Herbert J. Slocum's genera)
report of Villa's attempted Invasion
completed today, showed as its out
standing feature the fact that Villa
with from 1,500 to 2,500 men was
chased from the border fifteen miles
into Mexico by fifty-nine officers and
men of troops F und H under Major
Frank Tompkins. This force fouuht
I four actions with Villa's rear guard
of at least nine hundred men, killed
at least seventy-five Mexicans, recov
ered a number of horses stolen from
the cavalry by the bandits and emerg
ed wMth the loss of only two mounts
killed, and not a man scratched. Dur
ing the pursuit, which Major Tomp
kins could not continue without rest
and reinforcements, the Mexicans, ap
parently badly disorganized and fear
ful t f a chase by the entire American
forces, abandoned large quantities ot
loot stolen from the merchants of
Columbus. The army corral was
crowded with cavalry and transport
animals captured from Villa.
The death of Captain Pablo Garcia
and the serious condition of some of
tho other jvounded Villa prisoners in
the post, hospital caused a change in
tho plan ta arraign them on formal
charges of murder today on account
of the deaths of the eight American
soldiers killed or fatally wounded dur
ing the battle. Agents of the de
partment of Justice said tonight tha?
! these charges would be held in abey
ance until the prisoners were In shape
to appear in a L'nlted States court.
The best legal information in Al
buquerque is that the Mexican raid
els captured at Columbus are not
amenable to the federal civil law and,
unless they should be tried by a mili
tary court, which is not likely, will
have to be dealt with under the laws
of New Mexico. Unless Columbus
should be found to be located on a
military reservation, there Is no Unit
ed States law under which the Invad
ers may be punished. Courts mar
tial have extraordinary powers and
can use them much as they please, so
long as they sre not restrained by the
federal courts. Edit' r Journal.

Washington, .March 11. General
Funston, under orders from President
Wilson to hunt down Villa's bandit
army in northern Mexico, was moving
his troops at the border tonight be
hind a veil of rigid secrecy. j
War department officials, who hudi
given the i.order commander n free
hand in working out details of the ex-
ipedition, made it clear that tiny
garded it as imperative to success that
all information which might aid Villa
In eluding the American forces must
lie guarded scrupulously.
It was said tin- military plans c.
template a drive into Mexico that
-hould be both quick and certain. The
war department is willing to take no
hunees by weakening the border pa
trol, and General Fujiston's orders
were not to move until he was fully
prepared.

of Mexico which are under the control!
General Funston himself has urged
that all seen i y surround the movu-
ment of troops so lie may have an op-j
portunily to surprise the bandit chief-i
tain. While extensive troop move-!
luenlH were in progress along the bor-,
dor during lite day, the state depart -
on tit received from General Carraii.u,
head of the 1, facto government of
Mexico, a request for permission to
send Ids troops, should occasion urise,
through Arizona, across the border
inlo the l'nlted States, in pursuit of the
bandits. The note immediately was
forwarded to President Wilson on the
Mayflower and tonight he sent word
he would consider it until hln return
to the capital Monday morning
and confer with Secretary Lansing be
fore making any decision.
Viewed in Favorable Light.
There was every Indication that of
ficials viewed General Carranza's re
quest in a favorable light. It was sug
gested, however, that such a reciprocal
'arrangement probably never would re
sult in a single Currunsta soldier cu
tei'ing the United States, for officials
feel that with tho tightening of the
border patrol the possibility Hint uny
of tho bandits will cross Is remote. At
the same time it is felt that acquies
cence by the United States in the pro
posal of the de facto government
would go far toward gaining the sj in
of the recognized KovrneM.
General Carranjin's note relieved lhe
apprehension of some administration
officials who had considered that there I
was a possibility that he might object
to tile presence of American troopers
on Mexican soil. The communication
indicated that no objection would be
raised under such a reciprocal ar
rangement as was suggested. A reply
probably will be sent some time Ivion
day. It is generally expected that tile
American forces, which probably will
number in the neighborhood of 7. 5H0
men, will by that time be well on the
trail of the bandits who raided Co
lumbus. One of the chief causes of
delay has bten the necessity of replac
ing with Infantry the cavalry troops
which have been performing border
patrol. Movements of troops have been
In progress ever since General Fun
ston received his orders to catch Villa,
but their exact nature may not be
known for several days.
Discussion in congressional circles,
today Indicated further than congress
stands squarely behind the president
in his determination to run down the
Villa marauders. The senate foreign
relations committee met and unani
mously endorsed the president's action.
