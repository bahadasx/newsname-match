SAX ANTONIO. Tex.. March
11.? Instructed by the War Department
at Washington that he
\\ as not personally to command
the troops that will cross the
Kin (irande into Mexico to
search for Francisco Villa, Maj.
Gen. Frederick Funston today
began to arrange the details of
the expedition and to plan for
the safeguarding of the entire
Mexican border.
During the day the general'
conferred frequently with his
staff at Fort Sam Houston,
southern department headquarters.
A close censorship was established,
however, on proceedings.
All announcements were
made by Gen. Funston himself.
Ben. Fu niton's Announcement.
From Gen. Funston came this in_;
formation:
That an officer subordinate to him. a
brigadier aeperal would command the
* sntiwi .nuiiui*.
fHHIUTV M|FCWIIIVU.
That this officer would. have complete
chftrfe in the Held and would not
he hampered by unnecessary instructions.
*
That it would take two or three days
to organise the force or forces that
will go in pursuit of Villa.
That the first aero squadron, stationed
at Fort Sam Houston, will be a
part of the expeditionary force.
That a close watch will be kept at
all border points for any symptoms of
disorder that will necessitate the movement
of troops.
Cisposition of Forces Secret.

?J.tlonary force would be; the time
Ine forward movement would start;
w ;iether there would be one or several
fij -vs. and the point or points at which
t . lio Grande would be crossed when
tit seaich began.
: was known yesterday that Gen.
I- unstpn w as willing personally to lead
the force searching for Villa. It was
explained here, however, that the War
liepartment thought it best to keep
Gen. Funston at southern department
headquarters, where he would be in
touch with and could direct the entire
If there should be more than one expeditionary
force, the common direction
will fall to Gen. Funston.
Another reason assigned was that the
entire routine of the southern department
would be Interrupted if the commanding
general were in the field. Gen.
Kunaton said, too, that his place probably
would have had to be filled by an
flicer of leaser rank, not in touch with
|he border situation.
It in expected, however, that Gen.
Iftineton will make frequent visits to
the positions occupied by the invadtfig
troops.
The movement toward the border of
troops from departn enta other than
that commanded by Gen. Funston already
has been initiated, it is understood.
The amalgamation of scattered
fragments of regiments, transportation,
the equipment of the commissary and
other details, would require, it was
estimated by the general, at least two i
and probably three days. All such I
troops will be transported directly to |
tb? border.
The utmost secrecy regarding their
exact destination will be maintained.
Cien. Funston has insisted on this precaution
to the War Department in
order that Villa may be kept as much i
in the dark as possible.
Army officers at Fort Sam Houston I
believe the border is infested with
Mexicans friendly to Villa who will do
all in their power to keep him informed.
May Be a Long Chase.
Estimates of the time required to capture
the former constitutionalist leader
are obtainable, but there is a feeling
at the Southern Department headquarters
that the chase would be simi-4
lar the one which had as its object
the seizure of Aguinaldo in the Philippines
years ago.
Army officers are interested in the
part the 1st Aero Squadron will play in
the pursuit. No American aero squadion
ever before has had actual military
service. Machines were sent to
Vera Cruz and there has been aerial
scouting done along the border, but
this is the first real test of the "fourth
arm" of the service
It is not known when the squadron
will leave San Antonio, but It has been
announced that it will be ready by tomorrow
afternoon. Weather conditions

SUPPRESSES DISPATCHES
RELATING TO ARMY PLANS j

Brig. Gen. Pershing Believed to Be
Picked to Command Force to
Capture Bandit.
With heavy reinforcements of
cavalry ordered to the Mexican
border. Maj. Gen. Funston is
moving his troops against Paticho
Villa under a veil of strict secrecy.
Secretary Baker said late' last
night that the War Department
has not been advised that ?any
troops have crossed the border.
Several dispatches described
border movements of troops, but
these were suppressed, as they
might give some inkling of the
direction in which Gen. Funston
is moving.
Four Regiments for Patrol Duty.
Gen. Funston last night asked the
department for four additional regiments
of cavalry for patrol duty.
Gen. Scott, chief of staff, immediately
issued orders for the 1st Cavalry, Monterey,
Cal.; the 11th Cavalry, Fort
Oglethorpe. Ga., and the 12th Cavalry,
Robinson, Neb., to proceed at once to
the border.
The 5th Cavalry, which is divided
into three squadrons, stationed a' Fort
Myer, Va.; Fort Sheridan, 111., and Fort
Leavenworth, Kan., was ordered to hold
itself in readiness. ,
Gen. Funston advised the department
that this fourth additional regiment
is not immediately needed.
Are Ready at Fort Myer.
"We are as ready now as we ever will
be." said Col. Wilder, in command of
the Fort Myer squadron, last night.
"There has been no excitement, but
naturally the men are eager to get to
the border as soon as possible. About
320 men will go if the call comes. Two
battalions of the 3d Field Artillery are
also in readiness."
Gen. Funston reported various troop
movements along the border, but the
dispatches were not made public.
The general's requests as to supplies
and auxiliary troops of the special
corps were promptly complied with,
but details of these requests were kept
secret, too," since it was thought possible
they might indicate the route of
the expedition into Mexico.
Army officers estimated it would take
from three to five days for the three
cavalry regiments to reach the border.
The regiments from Monterey^ Cal.,
urobablv will be the first to arrive.
For Detail Near Columoua.
While no announcement was made, the
order was construed to mean that Gen.
Funston intended to employ the four
cavalry regiments now on duty along
the border both to the east and west of
Columbus as part of his expeditionary
force, which, it is understood, will be
under the direct command of Brig.
Gen. Pershing. A regiment of mountain
artillery, with its twenty-four guns
packed ori mules, also is available in
that district, and this force, with necessary
engineers to repair railroad
bridges destroyed by the bandits, and
possibly with aeroplane scouts, probably
will constitute the expedition.
The force would number, if composed
of four cavalry regiments and a battalion
of mountain artillery, approximately
4,000 fighting men, exclusive of
engineers and other auxiliary troops.
In a recent report to the department
Gen. Funston estimated Villa's force at
3.000, although some officers here have
placed the figure as high as 5,000.
Villa Bands Have Scattered.
It is taken for granted by officers
here, however, that the Villa bands
have already scattered among the
hills, and they do not look for a pitched
battle, which, they say, would mean
certain annihilation of the bandits.
Any movement the American troops
make in the territory south and southwest
of Columbus, into which the raid- j
ers fled, will be influenced by the loca- .
tion of waterholes, pumping stations
and other places where horses and men
can obtain water in a dry and sandy
country. It was said here that the commander
of the expedition probably
would station guards at the waterholes
to protect them and also to prevent the
bandits from making use of them.
War Department officials, who had
given the border commander a free
hand in working out details of the expedition,
made it clear that they regarded
it imperative to success that ail'
information which might aid Villa in
eluding the American forces must be
guarding scrupulously.
Drive to Be Quick and Certain.
It was apparent only that the military
plans contemplated a drive into
Mexico that should be both quick and
certain. The War Department is willing
to take no chances by weakening
the border patrol and Gen. Funston's
orders were not to move until he was
fully prepared.
Secretary Baker and his chief subordinates
remained at the War Department
until late last night, receiving
dispatches from Gen. Funston and doing
everything in their power to back
up his plans. Many of the dispatches
were forwarded by wireless to President
Wilson, down the Potomac on the

Action of Artillery.
"On the left bank of the Meuse the
activity of the two artilleries was less
spirited during the course of the day.
On the right bank an intense bombardment
is being maintained in the region
west of Douaumont. It has not been
so intense on the rest of the center or
in the Woevre.
"The enemy did not attempt any infantry
action along the whole of our
front. According to the latest reports,
i the fruitless assaults launched yesterday
against our trenches west of Douaumont
were very disastrous to the
enemy. The Germans attacked three
times in columns of four, but were
mowed down by our artillery fire and
the fire of our machine guns. They
were obliged to retire, leaving the
ground covered with dead bodies.
"Today, in the region of Douaumont,
one of our aeroplanes brought down a
Fokker macnine, wnicn ieu hi names
inside the German lines."
The Belgian official communication
reads:
"I^ast night was disturbed only by
some artillery Are on the southern part
of our front. There is nothing to report
today except the usual artillery
actions."
British Communication.
The official report from British headquarters
in France reads:
"We exploded three mines east of
Vermelles with satisfactory results.
The artillery on both sides has been
active about Albert, Hulluch and
Ypres."
Germany Discounts All
Claims Her Armies Have
Suffered Great Losses.
BBRUN. March 10. via London, March
11.?The German losses in the Verdun
operations up to the end of last week,
though accurately and officially still
unknown, are said to reach a total ol
only a few thousand in killed, wounded
and missing, according to a statement
obtained through an authoritative
source.
This total includes the losses in driving
the first breach in the French position
north of Verdun, the capture ol
successive ridges of this wood and th?
forest region down to the actual worki
of the fortress, and the storming ol
Fort Pouaumont, but not the operations
on the west hank of the river.
