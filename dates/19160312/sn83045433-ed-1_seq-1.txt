EEKS FACTS
ABOUT SILIUS
State Department Starts
Probe of Torpedoing of
Norwegian Bark.
IF AMERICANS REALLY WERE
HURT, TROUBLE IS LIKELY
Serious Complications Probable
Should Later Reports Corroborate
Early Advices.
The State Department yesterday
cabled Ambassador Sharpe at Paris
and United States Consul Osborne at
Havre, France, for full information
concerning the torpedoing of the Nor
wegian bark Silius, in which, it is
said, an American was injured.
Should later reports corroborate
preliminary advices received yester
day. officials declared that a serious
issue will be raised. which will cloud
the assurances given by the central
powers.
The report from Consul Osborne
yesterday said that the Silius, which
left New York February 4 for Havre,
was torpedoed without warning in
lavre roads on March 9. Seven
Americans aboard were facued.. The
consul's report did not give the na
tionality of the submarine.
The case was held to be comparable
to the submarine attack on the liner
Orduna by a German submarine last
July. A torpedo was fired at the Or
duna by a German submarine and an
attempt was made unsuccessfully to
shell the vessel when It put on steam
and outdistanced the submarine.
The points of similarity are that in
each case the lives of Americans were
placed in jeopardy, not lost by the
submarine attack. The State Depart
ment has no official information that
one of the Americans on the Silius
was wounded. This came in news dis
patches from Paris and if true will
place an even more serious light on
the case.
In the Orduna case the United States
made strong protest to the German
government. In replying the German
government admitted that the attack
on the Orduna was not in accordance
with the existing instructions, which
provided for warning and rescue of
passengers and crew.
Secretary Lansing said yesterday no
action will be taken by the United
States until the facts are known.

Bpedal Cable to The Washgtaon Hemid.
London. March 11.-After twenty-four
hours of furious fighting, the Germans
have gained a new foothold in the vil
lage of Vaux, and have won complete
control of the Corbeaux and Cumieres
woods. The German drive into Vaux,
marking their greatest gain of the week,
is admitted by the French war office.
Exhausted by their tremendous efforts.
the men of both armies tonight are rest
ing on their arms while the artillery
is keeping up a bitter duel. The fire is
most intense in the region of Douaumont.
West of the Meuse it has fallen off to
some extent, according to the Paris mid
night statement, which also asserts that
during the afternoon no infantry actions
took place at any point of the front.
Drive tn Alone Sector.
Simultaneous with their attacks against
Verdun, the Germans launched a deter
mined attack in the Aisne sector. They
drove in a French salient at Ville-aux
Bois, eleven miles northwest of Rheims,
breaking through the French lines on a
front of almost a mile, for a depth of
three-quarters of a mile. Twelve French
offileers, 7 men, a revolver cannon, five
machine guns and thirteen mine-throw
ers were captured.
Paris admits that the Germans pene
trated the French positions in this re
gion, but declares that by counter-at
tacks the greater part of the ground was
regained. A sharp artillery engagement
is being waged over the contested terri
tory.
The scene of this latest German
offensive is a point where the German line
approaches closest to Paris. The action
is Vewed yy French crties more ae as
attempt by the Germans to prevent the
concentration of reserves at Verdun by
keeping French troops engaged on other
sect;ons of the front than as a serious
movement.
Germans Mile Nearer.
The French report, which admits the
loss of a section of Vaux, states that Ger
man troops also are approaching thofort
of that name, having progressed up the
surrounding slopes.
The German advance puts them almost
a mile nearer Verdun, from the northeast.
On the opposite bank of the Meuse,
where for more than four days French
and Germans have been hunting each
other down in the splintered Corbeaux'
woods, the Teutons now are menacing

tion, from two sides. Their advance
through Corheaux and Cumleres woods

height ahi>. if taken would give the
Gernan artillery a c'ear sweep against
the forts to the Sonuth. Attacks against
Bethineourt, through which the Germans
seek to put the French on Dead Man
11111 (Mort ITomme) in a similar posi
tion, have been repulsed.
Dispatches from Rotterdam report that
large forces of infantry from the Itiga
front have passed through Mets on the
way to ren-enforce the Crown Prince's
armies before Verdun.
The German losses are described as
tremendous, although this is denied In
Berlin.
