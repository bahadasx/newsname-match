Secretary of War Baker told the

whether any troopa had yet entered
Mexico.

have their order. Tbey will go ae

It la believed Funaton haa started
forming the different dlvlntona which
will dash across the boundary at Bey
era! different places and awo'op down
upon Villa and his bandlta In their
own country.
Funston requested that prelimin
ary movements be kept accret.
Tho war department la paying no
hood to scores of telegrams approv
ing the hunt for Villa. It la busy
mapping out a campaign which will
allow the largest possible number of
troopa to return from Mexico alive
and unhurt.
Tho war department, however,
faced a certainty thai t'ie expedition

In order to minimize the American
losses, liiHtructlona to FunMon dir

Facing a campaign of guerilla war

a despernte and treacherous foe,
there la no doubt Funston's. men
will probably suffer heavy cnminll
tles. Hy an overwhelmingly and mid

army hopes to prevent fighting over

If Villa la not crushed quickly and
decisively, tho administration be
lieves military operations on n Pinch
larger scale will probably bo neces
sary. President wants to avoid a cam

caused by the war departments de
sire to have every arm In readiness

struck.
Americans must march through s
wilderness of meaqulte-tangled dosert,
where water la scarce. Many oh

establishment of bases of supply at

ROCITY
Head of Mexican Government
Asks for an Agreement
Whereby His Troops May
Cross Border Alter Bandits
Waahlngton, Mar. 11. General
Carranxa does not definitely approve
or disapprove of the American expe
dition Into Mexico after Villa, ac
cording to a message from his foreign
minister, Jesus Aeuns, received here
today, , Carranxa In this message sug
gested a willingness for Americans to
enter Mexico In case the Columbus
attack, "should unfortunately be re
peated" elsewhere. The communica
tion follows:
"In due reply to your courteous
note, dated yesterday, and trans
mitted today through Mr. John W.
Belt, I have the honor to Inform you
that having brought the above note
to the attention of the first chief of
the constitutional army and deposi
tory of the executive power of Mex
ico, he has directed me to say to
you, to the end that yon may In turn
transmit It to the department of
state of the American government,
that he learned with regret of the
lamentable incident which occurred
in the town of Columbus,, N. M., on
account of the assault It suffered
from the bandits led by Francisco
Villa.
"That although there has been a
competent numbor of forces in the
state of Chihuahua to re-establish
order and afford protection to na
tionals and foreigners ever since
Francisco Villa appeared In the
mountains of the above state, at the
request of the governor of the state
and of tho constitutionalist consul In
El Paso, Texas, the first chief order
ed the timely departure of 2,500
men, commanded by General Luis
Gultlorrez, with Instructions to ac
tively pursue the bandits who had
Just crossed tho line Into American
territory, which they undoubtedly
did compelled by the tenacious pur
suit of the abov9 mentioned forces.
"The above lamentable Incident Is
similar to the incursions which were
made In the states of Sonora and
Chihuahua by Indians from the re-
jservatlons of the government of the
I'ntted States. Incursions Into the
state of Sonora occurred more or less
about the year 1880, when Geronlmo,
tho Indian chief, who died not many
years ago in Fort Mount, Ala., led a
numerous horde and Invaded a part
of the north of the etate of Sonora,
committing many murders and de
gradations on life and property of
Mexican families, until after a long
and tenacious chase by American and
Mexidan forces the band of malefac
tors was annihilated and Its chief
was captured. ' -'
"The Incursion Into Chihuahua, led
by the American Indian chief, Vic
toria, commanding about 800 In
dians, took place between the years
1884 and .1886. Then the bands of
marauders, committing also many
crimes, went Into the country as far
as the village of Teljolochtc, or Tree
CastlUos, very near the capital of
Chihuahua, and during the first
formal encounter between them and
Mexican forces, after 'having loBt
their chief, they were dispersed.
"On these two occasions, through
an agreement between tho govern
ments of the Vnlted States and Mex
ico,, it ,wbb decided that the armed
forces of one and the other country
might freely cross from the territory
of one to the other In pursuit of and
for the purpose of punishing tho
abovo mentioned bands of marauders.

N SUGAR
Site of New Industry Is Busy
Place and Scores of La
borers Are Engaged in
Making the Foundations
South Grants Pass Is about the
busiest place in the northwest tbese
days. The site of the sugar factory
is a scene ot Industry and of activity,
and the hand of progress Is fast
changing the appearance of things
there. ', .
Monday the mixing ot the concrete
for the foundation of the buildings
will be commenced, the concrete
mixer and lta engine having been
placed ready for the beginning ot
real building operations. The first
building to be constructed will con
tain the boiler room, pump house,
machine shop and lime kiln. The
excavation tor the foundation of this
structure Is completed and the wood
forms Into which the concrete ma
terial will be poured are already in
place. This building will be of steel,
concrete and brick construction.
Paralleling this building on the east,
the excavations for the foundation of
the main structure are now In pro
gress.' This building will be tour
stories high, ot fire-proof construc
tion throughout.
A large wooden building has been
constructed Just north of the site of
the main buildings, which will be
used during the period of building as
a tool house. All tools and imple
ments used by the workmen will be
Issued from . this building upon re
quisition. To the east of this build

porary structures have also been
built. Including the blacksmith shop
and material sheds.
The sidetracks from the Twohy
railroad to the site are being rushed,
and steel has already been laid on
the principal Biding nearly to the
factory. Five branches of the siding
are to be laid through the grounds
to accommodate all the buildings and
warehouses. The transportation of
the structural steel and iron to the
site awaits the completion of these
sidings, a number of carloadB having

ing the night, It was officially an
nounced today. All assaults against
Fort De Vaux were repulsed.'
"After a bombardment, German In

BRITISH WARSHIP
FIRED SHELL OVER
Midi LIB
San FrandBco, Mar. 11. With the
arrival in port today of the American
liner China, government officials
opened an Investigation of the seizure
from the ship, while flying the Amer
ican flag, ot 38 Germans. Captain
Frank Frazier, master of the passen
ger liner, waa notified by wireless off
Honolulu to make a full report to
Collector ot Customs J. O. Davis.. 7
Among the charges made against
the British auxiliary crniser Lauren
tic, which stopped the China ' off
Shanghai, are the following: -
That the China waa fired - on,
though carrying the American flag,
and one shell passed over her bow.
That the China was boarded by
British troops, heavily armed, de
spite the fact that Captain Frailer
warned the soldiers to come aboard
unarmed. ,. '
That Germans who had no con
nection with army or war affairs
were taken away from wives and
children.
The British expedition was headed
by Lieutenant Steele, who declared
that every effort was made to atop
the China from sailing.
Considerable secrecy surrounds the
next move to be taken by Washing
ton. Captain Frazier admitted he had
received word to make no statements
aAd bold photographs and statements
of certain passengers as evidence.
Collector Davis said Washington
had wired him Instructions and that
the ship officers would be called upon
to make a full report.
' Tragedy and comedy both figured
In the seizure of the Germans.
Fathers were torn from wives and
children, women were left without
money or means of support, and busi
ness men of German name face
charges of being spies.
Only one German escaped. He
was William Strenger, a paralytic
and could not be taken ashore be
cause of his crippled condition. " ;
FOIL MURDER PLAN
OF GENERAL VILLA
El Paso, Mar. 11. General Fran
cisco Villa's plan to massacre Amer
ican Mormons fleeing from Mexico
to the United States has been foiled,
Carranza Consul Garcia informed the
United Press today.
Carranzlstas, Garcia declared,
have halted all trains on the Mexican
& Northwestern railway by which the
Mormons were traveling, pending the
result of Villa's new movements. The
exact whereabouts of the Mormon
party Is unknown, but Garcia Is con
fident they will now escape the trap.
The Carranzlstas had positive in
formation that Villa planned to in
tercept the Mormons at Guzman and
massacre all men, women and chil
dren. He left L'Ascenslon at day
break,. It was reported, heading for
Guzman, with 300 followers.
No steps toward" executing Presi
dent Wilson's orders to smash Villa
are apparent yet. Tbe censorship Is
evidently in effect. Brigadier-
General Pershing stated at 9: 80 a. m.
today that be knew nothing of any
contemplated movements. Pershing
said the war department's Instruc
tions were going direct to General
Funston.
It was reliably learned several gar
rlsona have been ordered from Wy
oming to the border.

Congressman Hawley Intro-
daces Bill in Hesse Pro-
cf $42,000 fcr PcTF
WW
Congressman Hawley has Intro
duced a bill in congress to provide
for the construction of a highway to
the Josephine caves. The bill car
ries an appropriation of $42,000,.
which is to be advanced from the
forestry receipts ot the state, the fed
eral government to be reimbursed
with moneys taken in through for
estry sources.
The proposed highway goes from
the upper Williams creek through to
the Sucker creek valley. An estimate
of the cost of such a highway was
obtained by the department some
time ago, being supplied by the office
ot the Siskiyou reserve in this city.
Supervisor Macduff furnished alter
native estimates, one of $42,000, the
road to go up Grayback mountain
from Williams creek, keeping the
caves directly upon the main thor
oughfare. Byt this route all travel
passing between tbe Williams and
Sucker creek valleys would have to
make hi elevation of the caves.' An
other route proposed by Mr. Macduff
would follow Williams creek up to
the point on the trail where the
three creeks come together, then It
would cross the divide and follow
Grayback creek down into the Sucker
creek valley. From the point where
the road left the Williams creek side
ot the divide a four-mile side road
would be built to the caves. This
atter road finds most favor with the
forestry officials 'here, and Mr. Mao
duff expressed the belief that. It
might even be better if the road was
not built quite to the cave's. He ,
thought some of the charm might be
taken away unless a mile or bo ot
the delightful trail was left for the
visitor to negotiate.
If the Hawley bill called for an
outright appropriation of $42,000 for
the building of this road, it is likely
that it might fall, in view ot the
democratic policy, but as it is only
a loan from the forestry fund. It Is
expected that It will meet with favor.
Twenty-five per cent of the revenues
derived from the leases, sales and
other sources upon national forests
Is returned to the state in which It
originated, and It Is proposed to anti
cipate this fund In building the caves
road. Practically the entire road will
be through the Siskiyou reserve, and
the forestry department is reported
as favoring its building.
