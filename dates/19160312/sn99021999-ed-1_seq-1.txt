ONE AMERICAN IS INJURED
PARIS, March 11. Seven of the
crew of the Norwegian bark Stilus,
which was torpedoed and sunk yes
terday, were Americans. The Sillus
left New York February 4 for Havre.
The Petit Farislen says that one
of the Americans on the Sillus was
Injured seriously in his legs and was
taken to the Pasteur hospital. He
Is John Hartmann, 18 years old.
The Sillus was a I.VMon three-master,
formerly the British bi.rk Helly.
It Is reported that Csptnln Fyvertsen
of the Sillus whs drowned and two sail
ors sre mlslng. The rest of the crew
was saved.
Only Four American, Ways Aareat.
NEW YORK, March U.-There were
only four Americans aboard the Stilus,
according to agents :1 the line here, and
they were members of the crew. It car
ried no passengers.
The Americans were: David Sherman
fit Bedford. Mass.; John Warbman of
Philadelphia, Daniel Noran of Connecti
cut and Henry Monahan of Boston.
The bark, which was commanded by
Captain A. B. Syvertsen. sailed from
New York February 4 for Havre with a
cargo of 2,300 tons of barley shipped from
San Francisco.
The local agents said the Sillus" crew
numbered seventeen iren.
State Department olflrd.
WASHINGTON. March U.-Cbnsul Oe-
borne at Havre, reported today that when
the Norwegian bark Sillus from New York
to Havre was torpedoed without warning
in Havre roads on the night of March 9,
seven Americans aboard were rescued
The loss of the Sllius was first reported
last night from London. Three members
of the crew were reporter! lost.
State department officials seemed in
clined to Mew the attack on the Sllius as
a serious affair.
So far dispatches to the State depart
ment simply have said the vessel was
torpedoed without warning. No mention
was made of the nationality of the sub
marine, and there was nothing to Indi
cate whether a torpedo actually was re
sponsible for the sinking of .the wssel or
whether It might have struck a mine.
If the Sllius was torpedoed, such an at
tack waa contrary to the assurances the
United States has secured from the cen
tral powers.
Secretary Lansing said no action would
be taken until the State department had
full information. '

IT MIGHT PREVENT FRICTION
WASHINGTON, March 11.
While American troops are prepar
ing to move across the Mexican bor
der to exterminate the Villa baudits,
General Carranza, in an official
communication delivered through
Consul Billiman, has asked the
l'nlted States for permission to send
his troops into American territory
if necessary in pursu't of outlaws.
Administration officials regard
General Carranza's proposal as
favorable. It seems to Indicate that
he will not protest against American
troops on Mexican soil, as has been
feared. Practically such a recipro
cal arrangement probably would
never result in a single Carrania sol
dier crossing the line, as the possi
bility of bandits taking refuge in
American territory is considered re
mote. ' '
It is realized that such an' 'ar
rangement," however, would go far
to satisfy General Carranza and per
tnit him, to comply with popular sen
timent in Mexico. There was no
indication early today how the pro
posal would, be received.
