That Carranza may even be making
a final play to prevent the expedition
entering Mexico, was stated to the
United Press tonight by a high Amer
ican government official unusually
well informed on Mexican affairs.
Carranza has sent large numbers
of troops to Palomas, south of Colum
buB, and to Agua Prieta, opposite
Douglas, Ariz., while an Important
pass near the Junction of the New
Mexico-Arizona-Mexico ltnes has been
picketed by a strong Carranzista
force.
Two thousand other soldiers of the
defacto government, originally intend
ed to go to the reUef of the endan

Bilence comparable to the European
censorships, the preparations have
gone on since yesterday. They reach
ed their climax tonight In scenes of
the greatest, but orderly, activity.
Such a ruse will make no impres
sion on Washington arrangements,
stated army officials unofficially. They
agreed with General Funston, who in
a message tonight to his superiors at
Washington, recently pointed out the
helplessness of the Carranza govern
ment, pointed to the report that while
Villa and a force estimated at 300
followers were enroute from LaAsoen
sion to Guzman today, he passed
within three miles an equal force of
the Caranzistas who made no attempt
to intercept the outlaws.
Arguing for the chance of going
into Mexico after Villa and possibly
meeting death, yet army men were
outwardly calm tonight.
Privates, "non-commission" and the
lesser commissioned officers could be
seen strolling on the streets as in
normal times. They say they are
going into Mexico, but don't know
when.
Only the regimental and staff offi
cers, busy at Ft. Bliss with the tele
graph and telephone, unloading muni
tion and supplies on side tracks and
down town telegraph offices crowded
with soldiers sending money and fare
wells to relatives and friends, could
the tremendous activity behind the
scenes be sensed. It was practically
certain from talk in official circles
that troops from several interior posts
were coming toward the border.
There was even some discussion on
the possibility that interior garrisons
would be among the first to cross
into Mexico with the punitive expedi
tion, leaving a strong nucleus of ex
perienced men on border patrol duty.
The invasion of Mexico was expect
ed to start when a sufficient number
of soldiers from the Interior have ar
rived to replace the border troops
joining the expedition.

Fears of Villista incursions between

protect Deming from 100 Mexicans
who armed themselves following their
discharge from mines in the vicinity.
Columbus produced a sensation to
day by turning up six dead Mexicans

WASHINGTON, March 1L—-The
American army going over the border
after Pancho Villa will be an army
of 12,000 to 15,000 men, the war de
partment believed tonight, after re
ceiving late dispatches from Major
General Funston, asking for more
troops. Funston called for four addi
tional regiments for patrol duty on
the border. This means, it was said
at the department, that Funston is not
going to take aany more chances than
military strategy requires that he
will call on all the U. S. military
strength available.
Funston's request was answered by
the war department ordering four
regiments of horses to the -.border.
They are to concentrate there imme
diately. It had been believed at first
that Funston would need not more
than from 6,000 to 8,000 men. This
would have left from 11,000 to 18,000
men patrolling the border, a number
(barely sufficient to guard against sur
prise raids from scattered bandit
bands. Taking of K2.000 to 16,000 as
an "army of invasion" would have

which the troops march. Every effort
is to be made to prevent any opposi
tion by the civilian population.
