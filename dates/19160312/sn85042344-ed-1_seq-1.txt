Plans Preparatory to
Invasion of Mexico
5 AX ANTONIO, Mui-ch 1 1 . Instructed by the war lciurttnt.it t Vh
inKton that he wum not lo perMonnIly command the troops that will
ltohs the Hlo (irando into Mexico to ttrarch for FrunciHco Villa, Major
Cicncrul FunHton today begun to arrange tlio detailH of the expedition and
!o fclan for the xufeKiiurdliiK "f the entire Mexican border. ,
Durinp the day the Reneral confurred frefiuently with hlH Htaff at Kort
am HoiiHlun, Houlhern department heailquniieiH. A cIohp ceimortililp wa
3HtabllHhed, however, on proceedingH. All announcements were made by
Licneral Kunxton himself.
From (leneral Funston came thiR Information:
That an officer subordinate to him, a brigadier general, would com
mand thri punitive expedition.
That this officer would havo complete charifo in the field and would
not be hampered by unnecessary instructions.
That It would take two or three duys to. organize tho force or forces
that will go in pursuit of Villa.
That the first aero squadron, stationed at Fort Sum Houston, will be
ft part of the expeditionary force.
That u close watch will be kept ut all border points for any symptoms
of disorder that will necessitate the movement of troops.
Fuiiston (ieneral Director.
Genera! Funston, for military purposes, refused to state how large
kho expeditionary force would he; the time when the forwurd movement
'would start: whether there would be
or points at which the Hlo Grande
began.
It was known yesterday that Gen
eral Funston was willing to person
ally lead the force searching for Villa.
It was explained here, however, that
the w:ir department thought it best
to keep General Funston at southern
department headquarters where he
would lie in touch with and could di
rect the entire border situation.
if there should lie more than one
expeditionary force, the common di
rection will fall to General Funston.
Another reason assigned was that
the entile routine of the southern de
partment would be interrupted if the
commanding general were in the
Odd. General Funston said, too,
rial his place would have hud to bo
fillid ,y an officer of lesser rank, not
in touch with the border siluution.
It is expected, however, that Gen
eral Funston will make frequent trip
to the positions occupied by the in
vading troops.
Troop Moyctni'iil Itcgiin.
Tlie movement of troops from de
partments other than that command
ed by, General Funston toward the
border already has been Initiated, it
is understood. The amalgamation of
scattered fragments' of regiments,
transportation, the equipment of the
commissary and other details would
require, it was estimated by the gen
eral, nt least two, and probably three
days.
All such troops will be transported
fVrrrtly to the border. The utmost
secrecy reiiardlng their exact desti
nation will be maintained. General
Funston has insisted on this precau
tion to the war department, In order
that Villa may be kept as much in the
dark as possible.

Army officers ure Intensely inter
ested tn the part the first army
aero squadron will play in the pursuit.
No American aero squadron ever be
fore has had actual military service.
Machines were sent tn Vera Cruz and
there- has been uerial scouting done
along tho border but this is the first
real test of the "fourth arm" of the
service.
It Is not known when the squadron
will leave San Antonio, but it has been
announced that it will be ready by
tomorrow" afternoon. Weather condi
tions are now perfect for flying and
It is thought that the start of the
Jonriiey will not lie delayed any longer
than Is necessary.
('apt. Penjamlu l. Foulols, com

rwho comprise the "filers" of the
squadron, and the eighty troopers

hard today preparing for their de
parture. A big part of the equipment
will go forwurd by train.
Fort Sill Officers Go.
All of the officers under Captain
Foulois, with the exception of Lieut.
A. It. Christie, will go to the front.
Most of them ure veteran aviutorg.
Several of them participated In the
flight of the First aero squadron from
Fort Sill, Oklu., last November whon
the squadron was transferred to Fort

Captain l oiilois and Lieutenants J.

the flight from Fort Sill. Other mem
bers of tho squudron are Lieutenants
B A. liargue, W. G. Gorrell, W. O.
K'rtner and It. H. Willis and Captain
T. F. Hodd.
While no ro orts have been re
ceived of disorders along tho border,
preparations have been :uade to quell
any that may arise. General Funston
has here about l.liuo men, comprising
tht three hind branches of tho serv
ice, that might lie sent to the aid of
the troops already at Brownsville,

War department officials who lud
given Hie border commander a free

There wus every indicutlon that of
ficials viewed General Curranzu's re
quest in a favorable light. It was
HtiggeMed. however, that such a recip
rocal arrangeemnt probably never
would result In a single Carranza
soldier entering the I'nited Stales (or
officials feel that with the lightening
of the border patrol the poslhllity that
tmv fugitive bandits will cross is re
mote. At the same time it is felt
that acquiescence by the I'nited States
in the proposal of the de facto gov
ernment would go far toward gaining
the sympathy of public opinion in
those arts of Mexico which are un
der the control of the recognized gov
ernment. (ieneral Curranza's nolo relieved the
a pnrehonsion of some administration
officials who hud cons'dered there

Tt generally Is expected that Amer
ican forces which prohubly will num
ber In the neighborhood of 7,500 men
will by thnt time be well on the trull
of the bundlts who raided Columbus.
One of tho chief cuuses of delay has
been the necessity of replacing with
Infantry the cavalry troops which
havo been performing border patrol
duty. Movement of troops bus been
In progress ever since Generul FunH
ton received his orders to cutch Villa
but their exact nature may not be
known for several duys.
Discussion In congressional circles
today Indicated further that congress
stands squarely behind tho president
In his determination to run down the
Villa marauders. Tho senate foreign
relations committee met and unani
mously endorsed the president's ac
tion. In the house Representative
Mott of New Vork. a Republican
member of the foreign affairs com
mittee, introduced a Joint resolution
Justifying the president "In the em
ployment' of armed forces of the
United States," and setting forth that
"the United States disclaims any
hostility to the Mexican people or any
purpose to make war on Mexico."
There was no general discussion of
the subject on the floor of either
house.
