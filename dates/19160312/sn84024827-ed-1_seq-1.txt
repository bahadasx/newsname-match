EL PASO, March 11. A private
message was received here tonight
from United States Senator Albert B.
Fall to his family in El Paso savins
that Oarranza had refused permission
for United States troops to enter
Mexico in pursuit of Villa and his
bandits. The message from Senator
Fall stated that, if the movement is
made it will mean intervention and
that the entire Carranza army will
act against the American forces.
This report was carried out this
evening when it was reported that
General Luis Gutierrez, a former Villa
commander who joined Carranza with
his entire command, was marching
northward from Chihuahua to Juarez
and should reach there some time
Sunday. Additional Carranza troops
are also moving up from the interior
of Mexico and it is expected that
there will be 500 troops on the border
by Monday.
At dark tonight it was reported that
trenches were being dug in the foot
hills outside of Juarez. A searchlight
played on the town last night and
signal rockets were sent up from
Juarez during the night to keep the
Carranza troops posted as to opera
tions and outpon work to prevent a
conflict among troops. The races will
be dead tomorrow in Juarez if the
military activities develop and it is
probable that they will be cancelled
for the remainder of the season as
they were scheduled to close within
two weeks.
Troops are now on the way from
Fort San Houston and are ejected
to reach Fort Eliss Sunday. As fats
as these troops are dtrained others

and regular soldiers are guarding the
gas plant, the electric light plant, the
cement plant and the other public en
terprises throughout the city. Mount
ed auto patrols are covering the val

Mexicans. Four Mexicans were ar
reted at the cement plant today ac
cused of smuggling ammunition
across the river to Mexico for Villa.
Sir bodies of soldiers and four civil

Mrs. H. J. Slooum. wife of Col. Slocum,
who is in command at Columbus, saw
the coffins of the soldiers, she broke
down and had to be led away.

eral here, has resigned because of the
attitude of his government and will go

thorities by a large number of
Mexicans crossing the line into
Texas, but investigation showed

conflict.
WANTS MORE CAVALRY.
WASHINGTON. March 11.
Funston asked the War Depart
ment late tonight for four addi
tional regiments of cavalry for

WASHINGTON. March 11. Funston
under orders to hunt down Villa, is
moving troops at the border behind a
veil of rigid secrecy. War Depart
ment officials, who have given Funs-
Ion a free hand in working out the de
tails of the expedition, said they re
garded it as imperative that the infor
mation which might aid Villa in elud
ing the Americans be guarded scrupu
lously. The request of Carranza to send his
troops into American territory if nec
essary to catch the raiders, was re
ferred to the President. A reply is
rrjuui . uudar and -ariH prohuhly b
favorable. The discussion in Congres
sional circles indicated that Congress
stands behind the President in his de
termination to run down the Villa
marauders. The Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee unanimously en
dorsed the President's action. Repre
sentative Mott, a Republican member
of the House Foreign Relations Com
mittee, introduced a joint resolution
justifying the Presidents action in
employing armed force.
It is apparent the military plans
contemplated a drive quick and certain
The War Department is unwilling to
take a chance by weakening the bor
der patrols and Funston's orders are
not to move until fully prepared.
Secretary Baker and his chief sub
ordinates remained in their offices un
til late, receiving dispatches from
Funston and doing everything in their
power to back his plans. ,Many dis
patches wer,, forwarded to the Presi
dent. Whether any troops had enter
ed Mexico or when they might move,
officials refused to say. Funston urg
ed secrecy, so as to have an opportuni
ty to surprise Villa. Every indication
is that the officials viewed Carranza's
request to send troops across the bor
der if necessary in a favorable light,
asit is believed it will gain sympathy
and public opinion in the parts of Mex
ico under Carranza control. It is not
believed that it will actually result in
Mexican troops crossing the border.
The Carranza note relieved the a pn re
cension of officials who considered he
might object to American troons en
tering Mexico. .The American invad
ine force will probably number about
7500.
SAN ANTONIO. March 11. Instruct
ed by the War Department he will not
personally command the troons which
cross the Rio Grande into Mexico in
search of Francisco Villa, Major Gen
eral Funston began to arrange the de
tails of lhe expedition and plan for
safeguarding the entire Mexican bor
der. He conferred frequently at staff
headquarters at Fort Sam Houston. A
close censorship is maintained, all an
nouncements being made by Funston
himself. The brigadier general to com
niand the punitive expedition under
FunBton was not announced.
It will take two or three days to or
ganize the force. The lirst aero squad
ron will accompany, and close watch
will be kent at all border points for
siens of disorder. He refused to state
how large the expeditionary force will
be or whether it will be one or several
forces, and at what point the Rio
Grande will be crossed.

ANOTHER WAGE INCREASE
According to well confirmed
rumor, which has persisted for
the last two days, wages are
due on the next pay day, for
another boost on account of the
increased price of copper. Al
though nothing authorittative
is known it is believed that
miners will receive $5.35 a shift
and muckers $5.10 and other
employees in proportion. ThU
is the highest wage ever paid in
the district or iy other part
of the country for this work.
"Accidental or Under Misap

Investigation.
That Alejandro Garcia, the thirteen
year old Mexican boy who was killed
by guards near Warren Pass late Fri-
Iday night "came to his death as a re-
Isult of a gunshot wound inflicted acci
dentally or under misapprehension as
to the identity of the deceased by
guards stationed to protect the Waf
Jren District from invasion by Mexican
bandits.' was the verdict of the coro
ner's jury, after listening to the evi
