NO
AMERICAN TROOPS HAVE YET
CROSSED THE MEXICAN BORDER
In an Official Report to; Washington, General
Funston Says Total o! Forty Seven Dead
Were Found in and About Columbus
AERO SQUADRON
Washington, D. C, March 11.
Up to a late hour this after
noon, the war department has
received no information that
any United States troops had
crossed into Mexico.
General Funston in an of
ficial report to the department
today said that a total of forty
seven dead had been found in
and around Columbus. A re
port that eighteen more bodies
are lying in the brush is being
investigated.
The state department an
nounces the receipt of tele
graphic advices that the cus
toms officials on the border
report that two additional
Americans are missing from a
ranch in New Mexico which
was raided on March 9, near
v Nibres, eight miles west of Co
1 lumbus. The raid was not suf
' ficiently identified to show
whether it had been previously
. reported.
The department announced
4 that it was not considered safe
for Americans to go to the Isth
mus of Tehuantepec.
The United States' reply to
' . Carranza's request probably
will say that Carranza's sugges
,.' tion will be considered if at any
itime it should become neces
sary lor his torces to pursue tne
bandits into American territory
through lack of sufficient num
ber of American troops to do
the work.
Funston in Supreme Command.
,t Washington, D. C, March 11 Gen
eral Funston to whom the entire puni
tive expedition has been assigned, was
given orders to capture Villa dead or
alWe and will probably have his army
moving Into Mexico by Sunday morn
ing. I While the American troops are pre
paring to move across the Mexican bor
ier to exterminate the Villa bandits,
?arranza in an official communication
oday through Consul Silliman asked
lie United StatQs for permission to
end his troops Into American terrl
ry If necessary In the pursuit of the
utlaws. Administration officials re
s'rded this as an indication that he
(11 not protest against the sending of
merican troops into Mexico.
Secretary of war Baker continued
to refer to the expedition as
,efenslve." This is significant of the
ir department's ,policy to make clear
4it it is proceeding with scrupulous
Hard for Mexican sovereignty.
It is generally believed In Washing-
V that no American troops will start
;oss tne Doraer until tonignt.
funston has confirmed the report
f. four hundred Carrancistas have
;hed Palamos hunting for Villa. The
reports say that Villa was at
Jnsion yesterday, south of Palo-

while lie will have the direction of
the military affairs along the border,
ill? expedition to capture Villa will be
in charge of a brigadier general. The
name of the commanding officer will
be announced from Washington.
The Iirigadier general, commanding
the expedition, will have full charge of
the direction and will not be hamper
ed by unnecessary Instructions, Funs-
! ton said.
The decision of the war department
to keep Fun. ton here was influenced,
it was said, by the necessity of having
some one in charge of the southern
division who is thoroughly conversant
with the entire border situation.
The full lirst aero squadron here will
be dispatched with the expedition.
When the aero squadron will begin
its flight is being kept a secret, but
Captain Foulouis, commanding the
tea officers under him, and the ninety
men of the squadron, were busy today
getting ready to quit Fort Sam Hous
ton. t
The organization of the e.'.-pediiion
will not be completed for two or three
days, 'Funston said, as troops are com
ing from other points.

T
ENTERS OFFICE OF MAN WHO
SENT HIM TO ASYLUM, AND
WOULD HAVE USED KNIFE, BUT
FOR OFFICER.
About five years ago, a man from
the western part of the county, by
the name of J. R. Thornton, was sent
to Xorman on an insanity charge,
by the lunacy board of this county
and the county attorney. He was
later transferred to Vinita, where he
was considered a dangerous man to
handle by his keepers. All the time
he was in the state institutions h?
took keen delight In breathing dire
threats against the county attorney
of Carter county, who was instrument-
' al In having him placed in the asylum,
j James H. Mathers was county at
torney at the time, and, paid no at
, tention to the threats, attributing
j them to the hallucination of a dis
I ordered mind. A few days ago,
i Thornton made his escape from the
I1C TRIES
Vinita institution, and the authorities
here were notified to he on the watch
for him, us they believed ho would
make his way back, in an effort to
fulfill his threat, and they considered
that he would make good the threat
if given the least opportunity.
Friday afternoon, despite the vigi
lance of the officers, he appeared in
the office of Mr. Mathers, took a seat
and entered into a desultory conver
sation. Mr. Mathers recognized him
and after some excuse went into an
adjoining room and called an officer.
Before the officer arrived Deputy
Sheriff Ballew, who chanced to puss
the door, was asked to enter, and
placed the man under arrest.
In the man's pocket was found a
large knife with an open blade, which
he evidently intended to use on the
former county attorney. He Is now
in the county jail awaiting the state
authorities to convey him back to the
asylum, while "Jimmy" is congratu
lating himself that he happened to
have a lucky day, despite the fact
that it was Friday. ,
m mi
IN INTE0
BY OFFICIALS
HAS CHARGE TO CLEAR UP
HERE AND THEN WILL BE RE
TURNED TO JEFFERSON COUN
TY FOR TRIAL.
The officers of the law are after
the "hot check" artists, and at pres
ent have incarcerated within the
county jail one who It is alleged got
rid of a lot of worthless paper, both
in this city and in the oil fields for
some real money, and whom, It is
further alleged, was trying to make
a get-away when he was apprehended
by tli officers at Berwyn, as he was
about to depart for other realms.
Edward B. Steger, sometimes
known as "Doctor," was for a time
located in the city of Ringling, em
ployed, it is reported, in a minor
capacity by the Ringling railroad. It
further seems that his tastes ran
away ahead of his Income, in con
sequence of which it kept him so
busy frenziedly financing his affairs
to remain in the good graces of those
who believed him to be "all to the
' ffood." Ho was well groomed, im
' maculately manicured, and had all
the earmarks of real money, so much
so. in fact, that it was no trouble for
him to obtain credit or get a check
cashed. But
The crash came. His bills became
due and his creditors wanted their
money. That was easy for the "Doc
tor." He would write them a check,
in most cases in excess of the amount
of the bill, and get the change in re
turn, with the receipt.
This worked for a day or so, when
checks began to flood the bank upon
which they were drawn, and promptly
returned with the usual inscription
penned In a bold, cruel hand on the
back, said inscription being either
' "S. G." or "Insuffish." Under such
circumstances, the crash was inevit
able, and when Steger gave J. W.
Krueger a check for $20 in payment
of a small bill, and got the change in
return, and when Krueger became
suspicious and was Informed over
the phone that the man was "X. G."
h placed the matter In the hands of
the officers, with the above result. J
Yesterday morning Sheriff Garrett re
ceived two warrants from the adjoin
ing county for his arrest, and when
th officers here are through with
him he will be returned there for a
hearing also.
County Attorney Hardy stated yes
terday that a preliminary hearing
would be given the defendant early
this week, at which time his version
of the affair will be given to the
public.

WHOLESALE ARRESTS OF MEXI
CANS SUSPECTED OF BEING
SPIES MADE AT COLUMBUS.
WOUNDED MEN CAUGHT
Seven Wounded Villa Soldiers Who
Participated in Attack to Be Tried
on Charges of Murder One a Mere

Columbus, N. M., March 11. Whole
sale arrests of Mexicans, suspected of
being spies, were made today as the
United States army officers completed
their plan for the punitive expedition
to Mexico.
Seven Mexicans Arrested
Columbus, N. M.. Match 11. Seven

dren, escaped and crawled Into the
brush. The raiders are sail to have
passed Into Mexico.
Despite the nervousness among civil
ians, quiet prevailed In the border dis
trict here Friday night. In practically
every case the circulated reports of
the appearance of hostile Mexicans
was shown to be unfounded. Karly In
the night, a Mexican refused to obey
the command of an American sentry
to halt, and was killed.
Scouts today brought in reports that

miles south of here.

ORDERS GIVEN U. S. TROOPS TO
PURSUE VILLA HAS PRECE
DENTS OF PAST YEARS IN IN
TERNATIONAL LAW.
Washington, March 11. In ordering
United States troops Into Mexico to
hunt down Villa's bandit army Presi
dent Wilson acted on the principle of
international law sanctioning punitive
expeditions against factions in a for
eign state which cannot be or are not
prevented by the constituted authori
ties of that state from attacking its
neighbors. Authorities on internation
al law and practice pointed today to
many precedents witnessing the gen
eral acception of this principle. It
was written Into the treaty of 1S&0 be
tween the United States and Mexico,
which now has lapsed, in the form of
a ,provision under which the military
forces of either country could pursue
marauders across the International line
where a 'hot trail" existed. Even be
fore this treaty was negotiated, howev
er, General I.awton pursued a band of
raiding Apaches into Mexico and al
though the Mexican government pro
tested, it recognized the principle on
which Lawton acted in acceptance of
the treaty.
Daniel Webster as secretary of state,
accepted the "hot trail" principle in
negotiating with Canadian authorities
during the Fenian troubles in Canada.
The Caroline, a vessel used by the
Fenians to carry an expedition across
the Niagara river into Canada, was
pursued to the American side by Cana
dians and there destroyed. Secretary
Webster not i fled Canada that the Unit
ed States would make no complaint it

embracing the village of Vaux have
been points against which the Germans
have launched vicious infantry at
tacks, but at both places their ef
forts to advance broke down under
the heavy fire of the French, accord
ing to Paris.
Merlin, however counters this asser
tion by announcing the taking of Dou
aumont by the Germans and says also
that the Germans have succeeded in
pushing forward their lines through
the wooded sector southeast of Dam
loup, which lies a short distance east
of Fort Vaux.
The claim Is made In the German of
