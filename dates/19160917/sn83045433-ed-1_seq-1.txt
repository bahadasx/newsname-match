begin paying strike benefits at this

Moral t;Xjty on the part of many girls

emn high mass In the Franciscan Church.
Lack of home training. Mrs. Moder said.
was largely responsible for the increas
Ing prevalence of delinquency among
young women of the less prosperous
massea. This deficiency was linked, in
her talk, with the prevailing lack. in cen

facilities at reasonable cost, where a fam
ily might be reared, safely protected from
the contaminating influences of the
streets and the reprehensible amusements
that beckon there.
Miss Margaret H. Reynolds, of Phila

the juvenie courts for the purpose of
dealing exchlibvely with the erring girl.
Mrs. Meder will preside at a meeting
