May Embarrass Movement

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept 16. All na
tional guard organizations which have
been held at state mobilization points
since they were mustered into the
federal service are scheduled to start
for the Mexican border son. Offi
cials indicated today tlat they prob
ably would go withia two weeks
"Experience" For All
Secretary Baker is personally su
pervising all guard movements. He
is determined that every guard unit
undergo border service and training
before it is discharged, ar.d intends
to use te troops in state tamps to
relieve those on the border, so that
the latter may return home and be
mustered out of the federal service.
Funds Are Lacking
One thing may alter this policy,
though officials now think it will not.
That is the lack of funds available
for transportation. Although no ac
count of the expenses incident to the
border situation has been made pub
lic, reports indicate that the depart
ment possibly has exhausted its funds
and will face a heavy deficit before
another appropriation can be secured
from congress to meet the expenses
of the border campaign. If the guard
movements continue it will be neces
sary to have an urgent deficiency ap
propriation bill put through as soon
as congress meets in December.
O. of C. Are Coming
Exclusive of the North Carolina or
ganizations ordered to the border to
day, there are 18,000 guardsmen who
have been held in their state camps.
These are scattered throughout Ala
bama, Colorado, .Mississippi. Florida,
Georgia, Virginia, West Virginia, Wy
oming, Tennessee, District of Colum
bia, California, Maryland with several
small units in other states.

him until we heard him speak, but
we came away feeling that we rould

northwest but he will have to fight to
do It. though it is normally heavily
Republican.
