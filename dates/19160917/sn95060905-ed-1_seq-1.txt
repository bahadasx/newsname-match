WHERE STATE AND FEDERAL

LAW GOVERNS
FLAGSTAFF. Sept. 15. Members
of the Northern Arizona Game Pro
tective Association here, are much
pleased at the recent action by con
gress In thoroughly approving the
Federal Migratory Bird law
This approval is shown in two sepa--ite
and distinct actions by the con
gress adjourned on Sept. 8.
On August 13 the senate sustained
the Federal Mgratory Bird law by a
rote of 58 to S, the law having been
previously approved by the house.
The particular measure was an ap
propriation of J50.000 to enforce the
law during the fiscal year beginning
July 1, 1916, which appropriation was
passed by both bouses of congress.
On August 2D the senate ratified the
international Migratory Bird Protec
tion treaty with Canada which simply
meang that Canada has now agreed
to follow the same principle that the
United States la doing In protecting
migratory birds certain months In tbe
year, a la well known many our
game birds summer and breed in
Canada.
This specific action by congn-sr
will put at rest any doubts ever en
tertained by anyone as to the con
stitutionality of the Federal Mign
tory Bird Law.
Arizona duck hunters will do tiell
to read the above and remember Ibnt
the Federal Bird law supercedes the
state bird law and that the open sea
son for ducks In Arizona Is from
October 5 to February 1. Also the
association calls attention to the fact
that all resident and non-resident
Arizona licenses bear this clause
Where State and Federal law con
flicts, the Federal law governs."
Also that the Northern Arizona
Came Protective association will
prosecute vigorously any violations
of the Federal Migratory Bird law
brought to it notice.
Association members also call at
tention to the fact that the Agricul
tural Appropriation act recently pass
ed by congress authorizes the crea
tion of game refuges on lands pur
chased under tbe Weeks law In the
Southern Appalachians and tbe Ne v
England states, which can be taken
as an approval by congress of v..e
Chamberlain Hayden Game Refuge
bill.

MINUTES
DOUGLAS. Sept. 14. The first
flight of an army aeroplane from Col
umbus, N. M.. to Douglas, approxi
mately US miles, was made yesterday
morning In one hour and thirty-five
mini!'.? by Lieutenant Thnroaa S.
Ilowen and Carl Spates. They arriv
ed here about 7:50 o'clock yesterday
morning, circled over the city and
finally alighted on the parade ground
in the rear of the officers' pavilion a:
Camp Harry J. Jones.
The flight over the city in locating
the camp was a pretty one. When
the plane was first seen it was at a
distance of several hundred feet In
the air. Many people in the lower part
of the city ran into the streets to
atch It, and It was at first report
ed that the machine had come with
important dispatches from General
Pershing for General Davis. Inquiry
developed the fact that the flight
bad been made as a test.

chandise to the value of $1500, day by
day over a period of five months, Geo.
Daly, floor walker of Korricks, after
being taken into custody by the au
thorities yesterday, confessed to his
.mployer that he had taken tbe goods.
Tbe self-confessed thief was ar
rested early in the morning by Con
stable Roy Morrell. He declares be
does not know what prompted him to
steal nor what he intended to do
with the loot. This much he told
'harles Korrlck, proprietor of the
store, to whom he came last Febru
ary with letters of recommendation
."rom leading business men Of San
Francisco, with whom be had been
associated for years.
At first it was believed tbe man
was a drug fiend, but this he em
phatically denied, and it is now
thought that financial reverses par
tially crazed Daly, and that he might
not have been responsible for his
acts.
Mr. Korrick was warned yesterday
that his floor walker required watch
ing. He Immediately notified Con
stable Morrell, and, armed with a
search warrant, entered Dalys rooms
on North Second street .where he
found two trunks and two suit cases
packed with diversified merchandise.

FARMER LOST TREES
FROM POISON SET
OUT FOR HOPPERS
Mr. W. E. L'Hame, of Cochise,
Arizona, writes the following regard
to the use of poisoned mash for de
stroying grashoppers: 1 will re
late to you my experience with hop-
pers in my orchard this year, as it
may prove valuable to some other
farmers in tbe future. When fighting
he hoppers I placed around every
tree poisoned bran mash about every
other day. So in the course of time
quite a bit accumulated around every
tree. Ag soon as the rainy season be
gan, the hoppers let up and my or
chard made a new start. After a few
days, however, my trees began to die.
A close examination showed that the
rain water dissolved the poison and
killed the bark where the trunk meets
the earth. As long as the weather
continued dry the poison wag inactive
and It should have been removed be
fore the rains came. I lost nearly 90
per cent of my trees, but hope It will
help some one else from similar mis
takes." Weekly Farm News Letter.

GIRLS
MAKE ESCAPE
F
DE-
PHOENIX, Sept. 15. Cutting the
wires of the telephone so that the
matron would be uable to give an
alarm and timing their departure so
that considerable time would elapse
before their absence would be discov
ered. Stella Lagford and Ruth Patter
son, two pretty young girls held In
delinquency cases, made a sensation
al ecsape from the county detention
home, 1151 East Van Buren street,
early last evening. When word was
finally sent to (he police department
and thcwsherffs office, the girls had
nad abundant opportunity to make
get-aj.y.
Two hours after the girls had
-r-ade their escape, Stella Lari-.rd
walked Into the sheriffs office and
annuinctd that she was ready to ii"e
b-rself up. She said that neither sti
nor the Patterson girl had outside
assistance in leaving the home; that
their summary departure was only in
the nature of an escapade. She said
she was sorry if the incident bad been
the cause of any trouble to the au
thorities, and said that If she were
returned to the home, she would make
no further effort to escape. Until a
rate hour no trace of the Patterson
girl bad been secured, although the
sheriff's office believed the officer
would be able to locate her shortly.
