NEW REGIME GREETS
iimncp" ti
Hazing Is Nov a Thing of
the Past at University
of Missouri.
TO GIVE GLAD HAND
Upperclassmcn Aid Fresh
men During Registration
Caps in Vogue.
The 19 1C freshman at the Univer
sity of Missouri will occupy an un
wonted place in the student body be
ginning with the new school year to
morrow. When Academic Hall throws
open its doors tomorrow morning the
student president, Lue C. Lozler, and
members of the student senate and
student council will be in the lobby
and corridors to help the newcomers
through the intricacies of registration.
The old order changeth. Lozier ex
plained the new order to a Mlssourian
reporter yesterday. He said the stu
dent senate and student council will
make an effort to have the letter and
spirit of the resolution against hazing,
adopted by the student body last year,
observed in every detail. All forms
of hazing and chi-chl-ing are abolish
ed by the provisions of the resolution,
said Lozier, and this means that the
freshmen are not to be Imposed upon
in any fashion.
The Passing of the Paddle.
So the freshman has an unaccus
tomed standing in University affairs.
He Is free to come and go without
fear of molestation. The strong arm
squads and paddle gangs have passed
out of his life forever. He can go out
with the lady of his choice and there
will be none to say him nay.
The traditional fall headgear will
be' In vogue this season as In past
years. In other words, the freshmen
will affect the small and flashily color
ed dome coverings. This Is not in
tended to be in the nature of humilia
tion to the first year men. at is pure
ly a means of Identification. "Were
there not some distinction between the
old and new students, the good Sa
maritans among the upperclassmsn
might waste their good offices on some
undeserving sophomore under the de
lusion that he is a young and tender
freshman. Think how you would feel
after getting a room and bucking the
registration line for a sophomore
when you thought you were playing
"big brother" to a "frosh."
Student Body Behind aioiemcnt.
So, there will be a demand for the
two-bit coverings as in the days of
j ore. Also sh-h the students can
not give up all their traditions with
out a struggle.
This new regime that is to be usher
ed in tomorrow has the moral support
of the student body, said Lozier.
The sentiment of the student body
should be sufficient to preent all
hazing, according to Lozier. In the
eent any irresponsible students at
tempt to disregard the resolutions
adopted to abolish hazing, they will
be broucht before the student senate
which has the power to try any stu
dent and recommend punishment by
the discipline committee.
Police Tate Definite Stand.
Chief of Police Whitesides told a
Mlssourian reporter that anyone found
hazins would be arrested and fined
heaIly. According to Whitesides, the
police can make an arrest anywhere
within the city limits, including the
campus. Heretofore, the students
have regarded the campus a sort of
"sanctum" affording immunity from
the guardians of the local peace. How
ever, the chief says emphatically that
the police have authority to make an
arrest in President Hill's office and
wishes to be quoted as saying that
he will answer a riot call at the Uni-
versit.vvat any hour. Whitesides nddet J
that he expected no hazing this year. I
Henry F. Schulte, Tiger football
coach, expressed himself as pleased
with the passing of hazing. He says
that the freshman class has more en
thusiasm than any other class of stu
dents and thinks it a distinct loss to
the University when this enthusiasm
is beaten out of them with paddles
and other forms of persecution. AH
this wasted energv If properly har
nessed on the football field could
cheer the Tigers on many Inches at
Rollins' Held this fall, said Schulte.
Freshman, fellow student, welcome
to our midst.

Sunday by a score of 4 to 1, after be
ing behind for six innings. Thomas,
