SEVERAL FACULTY
CHANGES OCCUR
Formal Opening Takes Place
Tuesday, and Lessons Begin
on Thursday.
Preparations are complete for the
opening of the thirty-second annual
session of the Mississippi Industrial
Institute and College which occurs
Tuesday, and President Whitfield is
exceedingly sanguine regarding the
outlook for the new year. An un
usually large number of applications
have been received from prospective
students, and the attendance prom
ises to be so large that additional
dormitory room is imperative. On
this account many teachers who have
heretofore occupied apartments in
the dormitories will be forced to seek
quarters elsewhere. One instructor
will be retained on each floor of
every building occupied by the
young ladies as sleeping quarters,
but the remining members of the
facultjvwill berequhed to seek dc
mage in the 'numerous ooar&ng
houses which surround the college
campus.
Seeral resignations have recently
been tendered, and the new session
will witness a number of changes in
the faculty. Miss Ella Lou Terry
has been engaged to succeed Miss
Bessie Newsome, who for the past
two years has been an instructor in
the department of English. Miss
Newsome has obtained a leave of
absence for one year nnd will spend
the coming winter with relatives in
Washington. Miss Terry has been
a member of the faculty of the local
public schools for several years past
and is in every way competent to
fill the position for which she ha?
been elected. Another resignation
in the English department is that of
Miss Bessie Huddleston, who is to be
succeeded by Miss Mary Calloway;
of Pontotoc. Miss Calloway is an
alumnae of the local institution, ami
ber presence will add materially to
the efficiency of the English depart
ment. Miss Bessie Heath, who has
for the past year been taking a post
graduate course at Columbia Uni
versity, resumes her position as an
assistant in history. During Miss
Heath's absence her duties were ac
ceptably performed by Miss Lottie
Howard, of this city. Miss Helen
Hutchcraft, Who for several years
has been secretary of the Young
Women's Christian Association, of
the College, has tendered her resig
lation to accept a similar position
at Oberlin University, Oberlin, Ohio.
Miss Hutchcraft's successor has not
yet been selected, but the Y. W. C.
A. forms an important factor in the
lives of college students, and an ex
perienced and thoroughly competent
secretary will be secured. There
has been two resignations in the ath
letic department. Misses Mary
Roudebush and Edna Wiswell hav
accepted positions elsewhere. Miss
Roudebush goes to the Peabody Nor
rral in Nashville, while Miss Wiswell
will be assistant directress of athle
tics in the State Normal College in
Kansas. These ladies will be suc
ceeded by Miss Dick Fitzgerald, of
Crenshaw, and Miss Grace Massen-
galo, of Hattiesburg both of whom
are graduates of the local institu
tion. Miss Emma Ody Phol was of
fered the place of directress of the
athletic department of the Peabody
Normal in Nashville, and while the
position carries a much larger salary
than that received here, she decided
not to accept the offer.
While the formal opening of the
college does not occur until Tues
day, students have already begun to
arrive, and it is expected that with
in the next few days the dormitories
will be filled to eanaeitv
Tuesday
and Wednesday will be devoted to i
the examination and classification j
of students, and the hearing of!
classes will commence Thursday.

FAMOUS THIEPVAL . COMBLES
FRONT TORN TO PIECES
BY THE ENEMY.
London, Sept. 16. The now fa-
The British tore it wide open to
day. In a 12-hour battle on the 8-
mile front from Thiepval to Ginchy
in the face of 1,200 of the Kaiser's
most powerful guns 150 to a mile
they stormed, pierced, shattered
and then occurred that stretch of the
German front north of the Somme
which hitherto had acted as a defiant
block to their advance on Combles
and Bapaume. The barrier broken
down, Sir Douglas Haig's troops
pushed considerable beyond it to the
northeast, carrying the menace of
the Somme drive almost as omnious
ly close to Bapaume as it is to Com
bles and Peronne.
The end of the fighting tonight
saw the British in possession of prac
tically all the high ground between
Combles and the Albert-Pozieres-Ba-paume
highway. Three villages
Flers, Martinpuich and Courcelette
and high wood were completely cap
tured, as wus the greater part of
Bouleaux wood. The powerful Ger
man redoubt called "Wunder werk"
(wonder work), because of its gup-
posed impregnability, was taken by
storm in the turning of the salient's
tip near Thiepval.
More than 2,300 prisoners were
taken, including 65 officers. All this
was achieved within a few hours af
ter the German war office, in its reg
ular daily statement early is morn
ing, announced: . f , k
"An Mtten.Ub by cyi'oUijr.oIe "J.v;
ish forces to recapture by an encir
cling movement our salient line south
of Thiepval met with failure."
The day was the most successful
for the British since the initial phase
of the Somme battle. For three days
their infantry had enjoyed compara- (
tive rest, while the artillery paved
the way for today's new crush.

our exhibition the stamp of national

covers a great range of subjects and
is so highly educational in character
that it might well be considered an

ing of hay growers of Mississippi and
Alabama, which is to be held at the
rooms of the Meridian Board of
Trade in Meridian at 3 o'clock next
Tuesday afternon. Business of vast
importance is to be transacted at
this meeting, and, realizing the fact
that the county should be well rep
resented, the local Chamber of Com

throughout the territory contiguous
to this city urging them to attend.
The object of the association is
to protect the interests of hay grow
ers throughout Mississippi and Ala
bama, to see that their products arc
properly graded, that they receive
fair prices for same and to takr
other steps towards placing the in
duFtry on a business-like basis.
Organization has as yet been only
partially completed, and among the
important steps to be taken at thf

name for the association. Two
names, the Alabama-Mississippi Hay
Growers' Association, nd the South

been suggested, and it is probabli
that one of these will be selected
Another important matter to be de
cided upon is. the talectloii of a city
wherein the association will maintair
its headquarters. Meridian, Birming

A WELL KNOWN CITIZEN
MEETS DEATH WHILE
OUT FOR STROLL
WAS A VETERAN
OF CIVIL WAR
Didn't Hear or See Approach
ing Train, and Was Run
Down on Trestle.
Mr. A. D. Whitfield, ace 7:,, Con-
federate veteran and member of a
prominent family, was run over and
instantly killed by west bound pas
senger train No. 104 on the Mont
gomery division of the Mobile and
Ohio railroad about 3:30 o'clock Fri
day afternoon, the tragedy having
occurred on a trestle in the south
eastern suburbs of the city.
Mr. Whitfield, whose vision and
hearing had both been impaired by
the ravages of time, was taking an
afternoon stroll, and did not either
see or hear the approaching train
He was, however, visualized by John
Sloan, not knowing of Mr. Whit
field's infirmities, thought that he
heard the train coming and was pre
paring to get out of the way. He
did step to one side, but hesitated
to jump into the small creek which
the trestle spans, and the oncoming
rain was soon upon him, having
knocked him off the track and into
the tiny stream.
The train was brought to a stand
till as quickly as possible, and Con
ductor Paul O'Conner, who ran buck
to the scene of the accident, found
the dead body of the unfortunate
man lying upon the bank of tht
creek, with his feet and legs stretch
ng out into its waters. Several
bones were broken and there wen
numerous bruises about tho head ami
shoulders.
Deceased is survived by his widow.
J brother, L. J. Whitfield, and num
erous other further removed rein
tives.
Mr. Whitfield was one of the old
est native-born citizens of Columbus.
His entire life, with the exception
of the four years which he devoted
to the defense of the South, had
been spent in this city, where he was
universally esteemed and respected
At the outbreak of the Civil war he
went out as a member of the Sixth
Mississippi Cavalry, and served gal
antly throughout the conflict. . At
the close of hostilities he returned
to Columbus, and for a long time
was engaged in the grocery business
here, having been a member of thf
old firm of Brooks, Whitfield & Cru
soe. Many years ago, however, hi
health began to fail, and for nearly
a decade he had led a quiet and se-
luded life, having seldom gone out
xcept for an afternoon stroll simi
lar to the one which ended in hi;
untimely death.
The funeral was held at the fam
ly home, No. 520 South Fifth ave
nue, at 4 o'clock Saturday afternoon
having been conducted by Dr. J. L.
Vipperman, pastor of the First Bap
tist Church, and interment at Friend

SYMPATHETIC STRIKE Will

New York, Sept. 16. A decision
of the question of a sympathetic
strike of 70,000 workers in trades
closely affiliated with the peruti'M
of New York's traction lines was ex
pected late tonight. A referendum
has been in progress among many of
the crafts for several days, and il
the sympathetic strike is nuthorizi-d
union leaders predict, it will be tlx
most effective blow that could hi
dealt in the carmen's strike that ha'
been in progress since Sept 6 on tht
elevated, subway and surface trans
portation lines of the city.
The trades in which the referen
dum has been in progress, it is said
include longshoremen, teamsters,
power house employes, stationary
engineers and firemen and machin
ists. Figures were available tonigh;
only from the machinists, and it waf
said their vote showed about 70 per
cent in favor of a sympathetic strike.
Union leaders attach much impor
tance to the RCtion of the machinists
most of whom are employed in plant?
manufacturing munitions of war fot
the entente allied, and say a strike in
that trade would be a direct blow at
the Morgan interests, the largm'
holders of stock in the Intrrborough

rollowing a patriotic and exceed
ingly able address by Gen. N. B. For-
test, of Bkom, adjutant-general of
the Mississippi division. Sons of Con
federate Veterans, a local camp ot
fn.it organization was formed at a
meeting held at the city hall Thurs
lay night. Prof. Dubney Lipscomb,
member of the faculty of the Mis
sissippi Industrial Institute and Col-ii-ue,
was presiding officer, and Mr.
fieoige O. Senter, editor of the Com
ftitrcial, officiated as secretary.
There was some different e of
op tiiort as to whether permanent or
g..riuation should be effected at the
meeting Thursday night, but Gen.
Forrest, who has had a great deal of
experience in organizing camps
uitouyhout Mississippi, advised the
i.eeting against further ib.Oay, tak
ing the position that the time be
tween now and November, when the
Confederate Veterans of Mississippi
will hold their annual reunion here,
is short and that the formation of
the local camp should no longer be
delayed. Accepting this advice, those
present oroceeded to organize. Ma
jor B. A. Lincoln, the efficient and
popular chancery clerk of Lowndes
County, was unanimously elected
commamier, while Mr V. B. Imps,
bti a.ies manager of the Columbus
Dispatch, was similarly named as
adjutant.' It will be impossible,
how?ier, for Mr. Imes, who is now
ill to at once assume his duties, and
as an immediate canvas for mem
bers was necessary it was decided
to name Prof. Lipscomb as tempo
rary adjutant. Gen. Forrest re
mained over here Friday and ac--omnanied
Prof. Lipscomb and Ma.i.
Lincoln on a canvas for members,
which embraced practically the en
tire city, and a canvas of the whole
county will later be made.
The newly organized camp will
hold an important meeting at the
city hall at 7:30 o'clock next Mon
day night, and it is hoped that a
large crowd will 'be in attendance.
The address delivered by General
Forrest was forceful and logical,
having been especially interesting to
both Confederate veterans and their
sons. He stated, among other things,
that Beauvoir, the home for indi
gent veterans near Pilnxi, which was
formerly owned by Jefferson Davis,
is now the property of the organiza
tion with which he is connected, and
said that after the present inmates
'tad passed to their final reward it
was the hope of the owners to erect
on this fite a splendid military school
for the sons and grandsons of those
who fought with such bravery and
valor throughout the Civil war.
Gen. Forrest also sketched briefly
the work which the organization is
doing in having partisan accounts of
the Civil war eliminated from his
Nuies which are u:ed as text books
in schools and colleges, not only in
the South, but throughout the en
tire country.
