Lack of funds available for trans

'that tho department practically has

WHAT remains of the Tulsa
County Fair of 1917, by far
this commonwealth's most satisfac
tory exhibition of Its products and In-
ousiries, win movo in a mammoth box
cur to Oklahoma City Monday wbeio
It will be entered for tho silver cun
offered for the best display of county
prouuciion. Accompanying it will be
lr. C. K. Karnhenrt, county furm dom
oiiMtralor. Hml three other officials,
who will have full cliargo during its
exhibition.
As those In charge prepared to de
part with the exhibit they expressed
a firm belief that Tulsa would comu
through the first winner this season,
ljist year the loeul display, fur Infe
rior to that which will represent home
folks, captured fourth place, and thu
season previous Wais awarded eighth
position. Kashig rlielr deduction on
theno results officials say that Tulsa
surely must bo reckoned with.
Tbe display as now outlined will in
clude practically everything raised on
this soil. Cotton, corn and kafirs,
wheat, oats and barley, alfalfa, pea
nuts and enwpcas, broomcorn, fruit,
vegetables Including every native va
riety, grasses, native and tame, for
age crops and other grain crops, are
counted In the showing. The variety
as well as general appearance und
artist Ic arrangement will be taken Into
consideration In awarding the pre
miums. Llvo Slock to Go.
Along with the farm products dis
play, it Is undcrat i that a nuo.ie r
live stock exhibitors who carried oft
prizes hero will removo their animals
to tho capital whoro they will com
pete. A quantity of domestic science
exhibits and some art work will bs
shown from Tulsa county also.
Hut while the cream of the passing
agricultural show moves on to other
fields oilier officials are deeply en
grossed In placing finishing touches
on tho financial affairs of the organ
ization. While tho fair Itself, so far
as laymen Is concerned Is past, there
yet remains a world of computing,
roceipllng, distributing and paying orf
to be done, officials found last night
that $1,500 of tho J3.200 fair debt had
been cleared by the recont show. They
ascertained that the total fair had
cost tho peoplo of this county soma
$7,000, more than 14,000 having been
apportioned In prizes, while fireworks
cost nearly 11,000.
Officials are decidedly optimistic
over the future of the fair and de
splto the fact that they are still neck
deep In bills and uncalled for awards
have turned their eyes toward tho
fair of 1917. which they expect to
surpass this exhibition in every par
ticular. Home of tho directors inti
mated last night that the fair next
fall might bo held later than that one
Ibis year and that Tulsa might openly
fight Oklahoma City for fair su
premacy of this state.
As yet all awards have not been
completely tubulated and checked
over. Prizes have not yet been an
nounced in several departments but

Wlmt It Said All Hlght.
As an example of the ability of the
Juvenile scholar to evolve unexpected
meanings, a correspondent of the
Wo-ld rolater that the following
e,n-stlon was put to a history class:
"What misfortunes then happened
to Bishop Odo?"
The reply came quite readily: "He
went blind."
An explanation was demanded, and
the genius brought up the textbook.
"There, sir!" triumphantly, "ths
book says so." The sentence Indicated
rend! "Odo was deprived of his see."
