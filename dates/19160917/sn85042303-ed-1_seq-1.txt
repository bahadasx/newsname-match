J. H. Ringer of Akron, Ohio, Is here
visiting with Ills brother, C. K. Riuger,
of the Rexall Store In Ardmore. Mr.
Ringer conies from one of the repub
lican states of the union, but he says
there are many men who have always
voted the republican ticket in his
state that will vote this year for
Woodrow Wilson. They like the man
ner in which the president has han
dled the great questions before the
country. Many voters In the north
ern states are laying aside the pnllt
leal cloaks they have worn so long
and are voting for the man regardless
iof party.

from Iowa similar to this from Ohio

it Is stated that the
democratic ticket will sweep that
think more of their homes and more
of peace and as the great accom
plishments of the administration are
revealed, men without regard to past
political affiliations are coming to the
support of the president. The Amer
ican people can be trusted when

STRUCK BY PASSING CAR.
Robert Williams. Aged 6 Years, In
Jured on N. Washington Friday.
Robert C. Williams, the fivuyear.
old son of Mr. and Mrs. Victor Wil
liams, was knocked down In front of
the Williams home o:i North Wash
ington Street Friday afternoon by a
car driven by Velio C. Suggs. Tho
boy was crossing the street and was
about the middle of the street when
Mr. Suggs saw him and stopped his
car, or ulmost came to a stop. Tho
boy saw the car about the same time
and turned quickly to run back to
ward liis home. When he did that,
Mr. Suggs thought all danger had
passed and put the gas to the car to
drive on. Hut no sooner had he dono
this than the boy under tho excitei
inent wheeled nnd turned again to
go back across the street as h'e had
originally started. Ily that time Mr.
Suggs was too close upon him to stop
the car, and he turned It as abruptly
to til o right as he could and the boy
was knocked down, the car dashed
Into the parking and struck an Iron
post and a tree in front of the Moran
Scott home, and the car was wrecked.
The car was coming toward the south.
The boy sustained a bruised back and
the left leg has two bruised spots.
When seen yesterday afternoeui the
boy had a little fever and was com
plaining with his leg.
The injuries do not seem to be of
a serious nature at tll, although they
are painful and will keep the boy in
for a few days. He Is taking but lit
tle nourishment and is suffering somo
oaln, although he takes an active In
terest in all about him, and at one
time Friday night he woke up and
recognized Mr. Suggs standing by hii
bedside. He asked about the car and
had no feeling of resentment.
Mr. Williams, father of the child,
said it was an accident, and that Is
all that could be said of it. That Mr.
Suggs was not a speeder, and while
he suffered intensely from fear for
the safety of the child he did not feel
that Mr. Suggs was to be blamed In
the matter, that he did all that could
be done to avert the accident
The boy had been frequently told by
his mother that some day a car would
run him dewn, and when the acci
dent occurred he told his mother ho
was not going to cross the street any
more.
