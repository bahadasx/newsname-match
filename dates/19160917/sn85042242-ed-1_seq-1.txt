Empey Arrested ait Mandan for
Threatening 14-Year-Old
Girl with Murder
ANGELA KARY WAITS
FOR FATHER'S ARRIVAL
Couple Caught While Making for
Minneapolis on Northern
Pacific Train
Joe Empey was arrested yesterday
at Mandan, on a complaint sworn out
by States Attorney Langer, charging
him with forcing a 14-year-old girl,
Angela Kary, to elope with him
against her will. The maximum pen­
alty for the offense is ten years in
the state prison.
The couple was captured on No. 8.
The father of the girl, Philip Kary of
Elgin, had telephoned Mr. Langer, giv­
ing a description of both.
Search Train.
The states attorney, with W. D.
Dopking of Bismarck, state parole of­
ficer, searched the train, finding the
two sitting in different seats.
Empey was employed by the girl's
father. He became infatuated with
the girl and was bound to marry her.
Her parents did not realize the situ­
ation.
Threatens Death.
Empey threatened to murder the
girl if she did not elope with him,
it is alleged, which forced her to give
her consent. In a hired automobile,
the pair got away Friday about mid­
night. The girl declares that she
did not know where they were bound
for. Thfey arrived at Olen Ulin at
2 o'clock Saturday morning, but as
there was no -train coming soon and
Empey did not dare to stay in town,
it is charged, he forped her to walk
to a station two miles this side of
Glen Ullin, called Kurtz. There they
hid in a box car, officials declare, un­
til No. 8 came along in the morning.
The girl lord'.Mr. Langer that she
was "tickled to death to get away
from him."
She appeared frightened and look­
ed worn and tired out.
Empey is about 2 years old. His
preliminary hearing will be held Mon­
day, before Judge H. L. Henke. He
declares that his folks live at Waso,
Minn., and that they will take care
of him.
A net was drawn around the elop­
ers, with Sheriff McDonald of Morton
county watching at McLaughin, S. D.,
Sheriff Hayward of Corson county, on
guard at Mcintosh, S. D., and Mr.
Langer, at Mandan.
The state's attorney declared last
night that Empey had declared that
he would plead guilty.

IL
Mercedes, Texas, Sept. 16.—It has
been a week of excitement. It might
almost be called a week of social gay
ties for the North Dakota regiment.
The school "teachers of Hidalgo coun­
ty, Texas 250 strong, have held their
county institute here, and the North
Dakota men have been their hosts.
The 11,000 men of Llano Grande
also did their best to pose as hosts to
the pretty educators, but with three
miles disanec between them and the
institute, and drills and hikes and
camp regulations interfering, they did
not have half the chance of the Da*„
kotans.
Major F. S. Henry and Captain A.
B. Welch were appointed as masters
of entertainment, and a regimental
parade and a formal guard-mount
were among the features which drew
the battalion of "school ma'ams" to
the Dakota drill field. The school
teachers cheered the soldiers and the
North Dakotans cheered the teachers.

Washington, Sept. 16.—All national
guard organizations which have been
held at state mobilization points since
they were mustered into the federal
service are scheduled to start for the
Mexican iborder soon. Officials indi­
cated today that they probably would
go within two weeks.
Secretary Baker is personally su­
pervising all guard movements. He
is determined that every guard unit
undergo border training before it is
discharged and intends to use the
troops in state camps to relieve those
on the border, so that the latter may
reurn home and be mustered out of
the federal service.
One thing may alter his policy,
though officials think it will not. That
is the lack of funds available for
transportation. If the guard move­
ment continues it will be necessary
to have an urgent deficiency appro­
priation bill put through as soon as
congress meets in December.
Exclusive of the iNorth Carolina or­
ganization ordered to the border to­
day, there are 18,000 guards who have
been held in their state camps. They
are scattered throughout Alabama,
Mississippi, ^Florida, Virginia, West
Virginia, Wyoming, Minnesota, Mich­
igan,District of Columbia, California,
Maryland, with several small units in
other states.
Reports to the war department re­
ceived during the past few days show
that these units have 'been properly
equipped, recruited and prepared for
duty.

TRIES TO
DEFEND HIS EIGHT
HOUR DAY VOTE
Fargo, N. D., Sept. 16.—Congress­
man H. T. Helgeson, just returned to
the state, declared tonight in an in­
terview here, that Wilson's failure
to handle the railroad strike situa­
tion when it first came to his atten­
tion, a full year ago, and failure also
of Chairman Adamson of the house
interstate commerce commission was
without defense. The issue that goes
before the American public as a re­
sult of the passage of the Adamson
bill is that of whether we shall have
compulsory arbitration or compulsory
legislation.
"I believe they favor compulsory
arbitration," he said. "I voted for the
Adamson bill because it afforded a
way out of a strike and the strike
would be of tremendous seriousness
in the congested districts of the east,
and far more serious than we of the
west can appreciate. Within a week,
people would have been dying of
starvation and probably, when a few
tens of thousands had died, we would
have had civil war. And I do not
speak in a figurative sense, either.
Helgeson is confident of Hughes' elec­
tion, declaring the candidate of the
Republicans made a great in Maine.

New York, Sept. 16.—Although
union leaders asserted tonight that
preparations are well under way for
the threatened strike on Monday of
from 70,000 to 80,000 workers in
trades affiliated with the carmen who
quit their places September 6, service
on sub-ways, elevated railways and
surface car lines continued today to
show improvement, it was announced
by the police.
A report that the Inter-Burough
Rapid Transit company and the New
York Railway company contemplated
legal action against union leaders in
the event of a sympathetic strike of
union workers allied with the carmen,
called for a statement tonight by
Theodore P. Shonts, president of
both companies, that "if others suffer
through a sympathetic strike, it is
the business of some people other
than the Inter-Burough to take it up."

Stiff Resistance From Kaiser's
Troops
London, Sept. Ifl.-^-General, Haig
commander of the British forces on
the Somme front, reports the capture
of additional German prisoners to the
number of 1,700, making the total
number of captures for the last two
days more than 4,000.
The continuation of the battle is
reported in the Britisli official state­
ment in "certain localities" south of
the Ancre river. The British proceed
ed methodically with their attack,
which was started on Friday, and the
Germans responded with heavy coun­
ter attacks, both against the British
and (French.
Comparative quiet, however, reign­
ed along the French Somme front, al­
though the F'rench report some prog­
ress north of Bouchavesnes and the
capture of a front northeast of Berny.
Large Villages
Lost.
Berlin admits the loss of the large
villages of Courvellette, Martinpuich
and Flers, but declares that strong
British attacks against Combles were
ineffective. It is estimated by the
flewitfijjf} tHat. 3f or obs*?*'
400,000 men took part in the Anglo
French drive Friday. Berlin says the
British made progress and that the
French attacks north of the Somme
were repulsed.
Bulgarian troops, assisted by Ger­
mans and Turks, have regained from
the Roumanians virtually all of that
part of Dobiudja taken by Roumania
during the second Balkan war. Un­
der the leadership of Field Marshall
von Mackensen, the forces of the Cen­
tral Powers have driven the Russians
and Roumanians back to a line run­
ning from north of Silistri, on the
Danube, to Mangaria, on the BlacV
sea front. The Roumanian advance in
Transylvania, Berlin reports, is meet
ing with stiff resistance fro mthe Aus
tro-German forces. Attempt of the
Roumanias. to cross the Alp river,
were checked at Haztg. Doumanian
positions were taken.
Italians Are Successful.
Italian troops have succeeded in
their new offensive toward Triest,
Rome says. Several important posi­
tions were taken from the Austrians
and the Italians also captured more
than 1,000 prisoners.
According to the Entente allies, the
advance of the French, British and
Servians against the German-Bulgar­
ian forces continues successfully.
The most violent fighting is taking
place west of Lake Ostro, where the
Servians are said to have routed the
troops of the Central Powers. The
Serbians have advanced northeast of
Floria and have captured 32 cannon.
French Forces Advance.
French forces also have advanced
in the region of Vetrenik, Kaimaokal
an and Fiorina. A belated dispatch
from Sofia says the Bulgars repulsed
attacks in the region of Ostrovo. Ber­
lin says the Bulgars retired to a new
defensive position after the loss of
Malkanidze. Serbian attacks on the
Moglesica front failed, according to
Berlin.
Neither Petrograd or Berlin report
any marked activity on the eastern
front from Regia to Kapul, in the Cau­
casus.
King Constantine of Greece appar­
ently has succeeded in obtaining a
new cabinet. An unofficial dispatch
received in London says that Nicolais

SEED COjUUELECM
Jamestown, N. D., Sept. 16.—"The
Indians on the Fort Berthold reserva­
tion have raised corn longer than the
oldest members of the tribe can re­
member. One field located near the
old village where the three tribes—
Mandan, Cros Ventre and Arikarees
—lived together for years, has been
under cultivation for at least 72 years.
One of the important operations in
Indian corn clture is the curing of
the seed. An Indian on the reserva
tin was once asked how he tested
his corn. He said that he did not
test it becase it was good and would
grow."
These are just timely sentences or
excerpts from a communication being
sent out by E. W. Hall, county agent
of Willioms county, urging early seed
corn selection and most important
that dry corn be selected.
'The Mandan Indians once had a
'keeper of corn,' states the communi­
cation. A daughter of their former
chief holds the office at present on
the reservation and it is her sacred
duty to preserve the seed from year
to year. She cultivates her field very
faithfully and cures the seed and pre­
serves it very carefully. This is a
splendid example to the white man."

CLAIMS DISSATISFACTION
AMONG REPUBLICANS
Ashland, Ore., Sept. 16.—Summing
up his campaign of the last nine days
in eight northwestern states, four wet
and four dry, J. Frank Hanly, Prohibi­
tion presidential candidate, in an ad­
dress here tonight, declared that, as­
surances of support given him have
been flattering and that he had noted
widespread disatisfaction among Re­
publicans over the recent campaign
of Chas. E. Hughes, made virtually in*
the same territory. Wet states visit
ed by the candidate are Wisconsin
Illinois, Minnesota and Montana, and
the dry are North Dakota, Idaho,
Washington and Oregon.
"The most significant thing we
have noted is the widespread disatis­
faction among Republicans with the
campaign made by Mr. Hughes. He
may cari the northwest, but he will
have to fight to do it, though it is nor­
mally heavy Republican," said Mr.
Hanly.

SPECIAL TO THE TRIBUNE.
El Paso, Texas, Sept, 16.—Villa attacked Chihuahua
City today with 600 men, penetrated part of the city but was!
driven out with heavy losses by the Constitutionalist army. .The
captured Villa followers were immediately put to death, General
Trezino was wounded in the arm. This news was received in
Juarez late tonight immediately upon the establishment of tele*
graphic communications with Chihuahua. During the afternoon
the operator at the station of Sauz, on the line between the Mex
ican Federal railway, 25 miles north of Chihuahua, reported that
cannonading could be heard. Dispatches from Chihuahua re­
ceived here yesterday reported that a feature of today's Hidalgo
gay parade would be 24 field guns. General Trezino said last
week that scouts, who had interviewed ranchers on Villa's line
of march, learned of a boast by Villa that he would celebrate
Independence Day at Chihuahua.
The hour that the attack was made is not known here, as
tonight's dispatch to the Mexican officials in Juarez lacked de­
tails. It told briefly of the repulse of Villa's 600 men, the cap­
ture of those who penetrated the ctiy and the wounding of
General Trezino.
