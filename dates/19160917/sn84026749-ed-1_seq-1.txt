THOUGHT DUE
TO "GAG RULE"
Coast Artillery Official Said to

With Congressmen.
SECRETARY BAKER SILENT
Other Officers Whose Advice
Was Sought Now Fear Pos
sible Transfer.
Violation of the War Department
"gag rule" forbidding officers to dis
cuss pending legislation with members
of Congress Is said by army officers
to havo been tho reason for the trans
fer from Washington to San Francisco
of Col. Richmond P. Davis, nsslstant
chief of the coast artillery.
While tho army reorganization bill
was pending In Congress Colonel Davis
Is said to havo discussed that meas
ure with members of Congress, antt to
havo admitted so discussing It when
questioned by Secretary Baker In a
circular letter sent to army officers sta
tioned l:i Washington.
Secretary Baker today refused to dis
cuss tho reasons for the transfer of
Colonel Davis.
"I never discuss the transfer of of
ficers," Secretary Baker said when
asked If It were truo the "gag" rule
wns responsible for shirting Colonel
Davis.
Other Officers Shaky.
Other officers of the gcnernl staff and
War College whose udvlec was sought
by members of the Military Affairs
Committees of Congress when the army
bill was pending are nervously waiting
further developments.
Tho "gag" order In th War Depart
ment, forbidding officers from discussing
legislative matters, has been in opera
tion for yours. A similar rule In the
navy led tn the conflict between Secre
tary of the Navy Daniels and Rear Ad
miral Bradley Flske, and was respon
sible for the transfer of that officer from
Washington, t
When the army Mil vaji up for con
flJ'raUomtlKTo w'ore diarsi-s Riuuntf pa
clflst loaders In Congress that the army
was conducting a propaganda for the
bill, since officers were Interested In the
firomotlons that would result from the
ncreose In army strength. Cautionary
word was then given out by the Wor
Department to put officers on their
guard.

Colonel Davis Is said to have acknowl
edged he had replied tn questions asked
him by members of Congress. He be
lieved It no moro than the courtesy due
members of Congress to answer ques
tions asked him concerning matters In
hit branch of tho service.
No official announcement of the rea
sons for Colonel Davis' transfer was
made by Secretary Baker, and It was
said today none will be made.
Under tho ordinary procedure of the
War Department Colonel Davis would
have two years yet to serve before
coming under the provisions of the
"Manchu" law limiting an officer
tenure in the bureaus to four years.
Colonel Davis will he succeeded as
assistant chief of the coast artillery
by Col. Ira A. Haynes, who has been
commandant of the coast defenses at
Fort Monroe.

Bulk of 18,000 Guardsmen Ex
pect to Move Within Two
Weeks.
Orders by Secretary of War Raker
sending three North Carolina Na
tional Guard regiments to the border
arc expected to bo followed within
the next two weeks by the dispatch
South, 'of the bulk of the 18,000
Kuardk remaining In State militia
camps
The Wjopi remaining Include the
Dlstrk-J of Columbia antr Virginia
itationl Guard organisations and
part ofi the Maryland militia.
Coincident with the orders sending
moro troops to the border the War
Department Is expected within a few
days to order 10,000 troops home from
the border.
3,100 From North Carolina.
There nre 3.100 men In tho North
Carolina regiments affected by Secre
tary Raker's latest order. Added to
the 2,000 Tennessee troops sent to tin
border earlier In the week this gives
more than 5,000 troops available to
relieve guardsmen who have been on
the border for months.
Secretary llaker will not announci
the exact number to bo returned, but
he sold more men will be brought
back than were sent down. Best In
formation In the army Is that at
least 10.000 will be ordered home.
Maryland Expected Back.
There Is a probability that Maryland
troops will be among the first brougnt
home, as they were among the first sent
to the border. Senator Blair Lee has
recently been In conference with Secre
tary Raker rogardlng the withdrawal of
Maryland mllltla.
It Is hardly thought possible that tho
District guard will be broucht back In
the first lot returned, since there nre
troops of many of the States that have
seen more border service than tho Dis
trict guardsmen now on patrol duty.

LONDON. Sept. 17.-Tho British war
office reports General Halg's advance

from Bapaume, tho objective toward
which they have been striving for the
last ten weeks.
More than 4.000 prisoners have been
taken In the two days' drive, among
whom aro 167 officers.
Along the six-mile front from Pozteres
to Comblcs the British have pushed
forward from ono to two miles In the
last two days. This has brought them
beyond the high ground which resisted
their advance for the last month. The
way (s now open for a wider offensive.
The Germans made only feeble effort
at counter attacks. ' Rcrlln admits that
Flora, Martlnpulch, nnd Courcclette were
lost. This Is an admission that the
first of the new defense lines haa been
smashed.
Tho efficient work of the British aero
