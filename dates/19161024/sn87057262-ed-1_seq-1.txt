BERLIN, Oct. 24.—Two powerful

threaten to crush Rumania in a
mighty vise and put her out of the
I war before winter.
Field Marshal Mackensen's German

It is 'believed here that serious

ital when news of the loss of Ru

Mackensen's easy victory at Con

Rtunanian's lack of artillery, it is un
derstood here. When Falkenhayn be
gan sweeping the Rumanians out of
Transylvania, the Rumanians hastily
shifted from Dobrudja to the Tran
eylvanian passes to check the invas
ion of their western borders. The
Russians brought reinforcements in
men into Dobrudja, but were unable
to bring adequate artillery equipment
and the enemy batteries were unable
to offer effective opposition to the
Teutonic advance. One report, from
Sofia today said that Constanza was
wou with hardly any fighting, the
Rumanians evacuating shortly after
German detachments cut the railway
to the vest. Cavalry forces entered
the city in the afternoon and found
it deserted by the enemy.
The decisive victory over the Ru

DENVER, Colo., Oct. 24.—/Phis was
booked as the busiest of all the busy
days Colonel Roosevelt has had since
he started on his 6,300 mile jaunt
through the southwest and middle
west In the interests of Republican
Candidate Hughes. He arrived here
shortly after ten o'clock, got a "stren
uous" welcome, was paraded through
the main streets 11 the Brown Palace
hotel, attended fc luncheon, had an
auto tour among the nearby hills and
spoke at a woman's meeting this aft:
ernoon at the auditorium. This even
ing he is to lead another parade at

Hughes' women's special and address
another audienco at the auditorium.
Colonel Roosevelt today, for the
first time, expressed himself regard

woman's demonstration during the
president's visit there was broken.
He took t*it« incident as one of the
subjects in his speech this afternoon.
The speech was extemporaneous.
The colonel believes, his meeting to

made against them.
Roosevelt had an extra speech
wrung from him yesterday by the
local committee at Ia3Vegas, N. M.,
where the population is sixty per
cent Mexican. He pleaded for straight
Americanism regardless of anteced
ents, and said if war with 'Mexico
does come and he is permitted to
raise a brigade, the first people he
will appeal to will be the American
Mexicans of New Mexico.
The Albuquerque stop yesterday
cost the colonel five cents more than
he had anticipated.
Two busy movie men who had hired
cowboys and cowgirls, anti had
bought flags for the school children
to add a touch of color to the parade,
asked the colonel to pose with an
Indian woman who makes her living
by letting tourists take her picture.
They had promised her a quarter. She
thought she was to get the money
from Roosevelt and when the movie
men began grinding without any
money having been given her, she
yelled at the cSfconel "twenty-five
cents or no picture."
Roosevelt pulled a nickel, all the
change he had, from his pocket and
gave it to her. She pocketed the
nickel, but refused to go on unless
she got the union wage. The picture
was taken as the colonel was handing
her the coin.

Griswold Fair Jhloro formed While House is Looted by
Thieves aluables Worth Close to $100,000
[United Press Leased Wire Service]
NEW YORK, Oct. 24.—One of the biggest robberies that has occurred about New York
in years was reported to the police today when Frank Grey Griswold, prominent Wall street
and sporting man, told of burglars entering his Long Island home last night and escaping
with jewelry and silver valued iat between $30,000 and $100,000.
This estimate of the loss was by Griswold! and his wife who motored in to head
quarters to report the robbery.
Griswold, his wife and her daughter, Miss Mary Canfield, are believed to have been
chloroformed by the robbers at the Griswold house, one of the show places of Long Island..
GriSwold and Mrs. Griswold told the police they awoke this morning with a severe headache
and the daughter was ilL In one of the rooms was found a rag or handkerchief, which
was believed to have been saturated with chloroform and to have been used in rendering
members of the household unconscious. Foot prints were oujid! in all of the sleeping rooms.
The burglars apparently took their time. They ransacked drawers and closets throughout
the house, opened jewel cases and picked out only the most costly gems and piled the
empty boxes up behind curtains in rooms on the lower floor.
AIT indications were that the robbers came to the house and escaped in an automobile.
Griswold said automobile tracks leading up to the house were found in the grass.

WOMEN VOTES
Bunch of Ballots Which is
Really Worth Effort of
Any Candidate to
Go After.
BOTH SIDES CLAIM IT
The two big 'parties admitted this
frankly today, and said they are turn
ing every possible attention to woo
ing the suffragette ballots.
Each side claimed the majority of
the women would be for them, but
each was jUBt as frank In admitting
that it is hard to tag women voters
and that there will be much independ
ent voting.
As the republican woman's branch
put it. "the women will not vote as
their husbands, brothers and sweet
hearts do."
The democratic camp said, "suffrage
will not be a determining factor. Wo
men will reason for themselves and
vote as they see fit, though we be
llve they will see that Wilson is their
beet hope.''
They are very earnest folk—these
women campaigners. A few around
headquarters of both parties looked
as though thlsv hunt for the elusive
vote might be a fad, but tor the most
part they had their coats off and were
hustling.
Both sides are making a big drive
on strictly economic questions, argu
ing that what affects men also af
fects women. Workers at Hughes
headquarters were busily engaged in
mailing out a list of Questions for
women to ponder, involving largely
matters of higher living costs, tariff
and the like. These circulars sug
gested, too, that on strictly women's
and children's matters, the G. O. P.
hart been the more favorable.
Around the corner, near the Grand
Central station, the democratic women
were just as busy mailing out litera
ture to prove that the children's bu
reau, commission on industrial re
lations, the child labor bill and even
the federal reserve act and rural
credits measure are big arguments
why Wilson should have the women's
vote.
The states where women vte are
yoming, Colorado, Utah, Idaho,
Washington, California, Oregon, Ari

abbut 800,000 votes, while-- t^ whole
