Jttmcs A. Ward has filed suit In the
county court against Walter V. Hoag
land and Moso McFarland for $503.00
damago caused by dogs, which it is
charged belonged to the defendants
and were allowod to run at largo.
These dogs, it is alleged, broko Into the
yard of tho plaintiff at 502 west Front
street September 21st, and killed sev-ority-olght
Belgian hares which wore
enclosed in a section of the grounds
surrounded with wlro netting. Tho
plaintiff says tho damago to the fence,
cages and other property was $15 and
tho hares killed were worth $253. Mr.
Ward claims that ho had been In tho
pet stock business for some time and
had collected stock of tho first class
and established a roputatton for such,
and that tho business is now ruined
and destroyed and tho stock cannot
bo Teplnced for several years. In ad
dition to tho claim for damages to the
cages and tho death of of tho animals
Mr. Ward asks for $235 damage for
the ruination of the reputation ho .had
mado in this work.
