There were certain reasons appar

ively sponsored, aided and abetted
by the admitted leader of the repub
lican parly in the slate. To Cilleii
water and Bursum it was McDonald
or bust. They simply must have Mc
Donald and wouldn't be happy uti
le ss they did have him.
At that they eiinie near gaining
their wish. When the democratic
convention met In Santa Fe, McDon

I here was wild rejoicing in the repub

pnitv of Lincoln and lira lit and Mc
kinley considered that they had got
ten even more than they wanted.
With McDonald on tho ticket for
lieutenant-governor, they argued. It,
would seem thai the democrats were
afiaid t" name him for governor and
they could make all the fight on his

And so thev got McDonald. In
