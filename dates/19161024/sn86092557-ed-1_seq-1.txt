done very adroitly and even tlie lie
publicans did not suspect that it was
going on until very recently. It Is
believed lioro that the trusting Mr.
Chilton has not found it out yet. although
he may have some very strong
suspicions and is lying low in the hopu
that he can get some brass tacks evidence.
Little good that would do him. His
goose Is cooked, and it Is altogether
probable that they would not take the
trouble to deny It if he came hero to
make a protest at the state headquarters.
The effort to elect Cornwell is one
of the most earnest that the Democrats
of West Virginia have made In
years and there Is a prospect that others
will be sacrificed to political necessity
and that all the candidates on the
ticket will find evidence of base ingratitude
In the returns when they are
made up so that they can be analyzed.
Even the head of the ticket is not safe.
The battle cry Is "elect Cornwell no
matter how much it costs."

With the election just two weeks

a straight tip from the town which
shelters the whole works of the Democratic

It is:
William Edwin Chilton, Democrat,
habitat Charleston on the Kanawha,
who wants to be re-elected to the United
Statos Senate, is a licked matt,
and the Democrats who are putting :
up the money and otherwise running
the campaign know it, and have known
It for the past ten days.
Chilton never was a strong man
with the people and what was worse
tor bis chances of being elected Is that
the powers that be in the Democratic
party were never strong for him. They
took him because there was no way
Dut of it slit . of clvine him the sort
Df a deal that they handed out to poor

{Special Dispatch to West Virginian)
CHARLESTON, W. Va., Oct. 24.?
No political party organization not
comprehended within the definition
found In section 1 of the primary election
law when properly interpreted,
can participate in the general election.
This was determined by the Supreme
Court of Appeals' today in refusing
a peremptory writ of mandamus
on petition of Cunningham and others
against Cokelly, circuit clerk of
Ritchie county, and the board of election
commissioners.
This decision prevents the placing
of the Prohibition party ticket on the
West Virginia ballot. Judge Lynch,
who wrote the opinions announced
from the bench that in those counties
wncre me lie kg t lias aireaay been
printed tbe ballot will not be vitiated.
The constitutionality qf the primary
election law provision which provides
that a voter shall announce his name
and sign his namef and place of residence
In a book o f the party whose
ballot he wishes to cast, aside from
subscribing to an oath verifying his
party affiliation, was declared today
by tho Supreme court of Appeals. The
decision was rendered when'the court
affirmed the Circuit court of Logan

Hundreds Planning to Hear
Afternoon Address at
Court House.
Judge Ira E. Robinson. who has been
spending (lie past week in the southern
part of the state with such good
tvisults, wi',1. invade Marion county ]
this week, speaking at Fairmont on the
afternoon ot Friday the 27th. and at;
Mannlngton that night. It hud been ;
the intention of lie .Marion couny committee
to have Judge Robinson make
only one address in this county but the
requests from the upper end of Marlon
have been so strong that a date has '
been arranged there.
'She Fairmont meeting will be held |
at the court house on Friday after-1
noon at 2:30 o'clock, and while the date j
lias only been arranged and little lime :
given for advertising, it is the expectation
that tlic crowd will be one
of the largest that ever assembled in .
Fairmont lor a political gathering.
Judge Robinson's meetings have j
been breaking attendance records in |
most of the counties in the southern i
part of West Virginia, and his unusual
popularity in Marion will undoubted. ;
ly bring like crowds here. The Re- \
publican club of the Normal school
lias announced its intention of attend- i
ing the Robinson meeting in a body. I
The Hughes club will also meet at
their rooms in the Watson hotel, and
will march to the court houso in a
body.
One of the most interesting features
of the meeting here will be the
gamuts ui mutinied ciuxi'ns ana automobiles
that will escort Judge Robinson
to the court house where he is to
spealc.
All of the delegations from Wlnfield.
Union and Paw Paw districts will
come to Fairmont on horseback and
will ride in a body in the parade. Each
of the district parties' will be under
their own marshal and he cavalcade Is
expected to contain several hundred
horses. The majority of the horses
owned in tho county are from these
districts.
More than fifty automobiles belonging
to Fainiiont Republicans have already
been promised for the parade.
These will follow the horses and carry
many of the older voters who will turn
out to hear the next governor.
Besides the mounted cavalcade and.
the automoble escort that will greet
Judge Robinson when he appears here,
it Is planned to have a band; and the.
Pierpont Post Drug Corps, which is
composed of enthusiastic Republicans.
will also likely be on band.
In case the weather is pleasant the j
meeting will likely be an outdoor one
as it is feared that the circuit court
room will not be large enough to accommodate
all of the voters who will
turn out to bear Judge Robinson.
