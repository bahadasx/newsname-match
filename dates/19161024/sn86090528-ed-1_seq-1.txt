Two Powerful Teuton Armies Threaten to

Roumanians Hastily Evacuate Seaport of
Constanza to Prevent Annihilation
Hope to Intimidate Greece
By TJnited Press.
Berlin, Oct. 24. Field Marshal Mac-
kensen captured the Danube town of
Rasova, eight miles south of the im
portant bridgehead of Cernavoda and
the railway jurction at Medjidia, ac
cording to official announcement to
day. ,
By United Press.
Berlin, Oct. 24 Two powerful ar
mies that are attacking from cast
and west are threatening the crush
Roumania in a mighty vise and put
her out of the war before winter
comes.
Gen. Mackensen's German, Bulga
rian .and Turkish forces have captured
nearly one-third of the Coustanza
Cernavoda railway and are pressing
upon Cernavoda itself. The Rouman
ians evacuated Constanza, falling back
hi"'"' ape annihilation.
-on the Roumanian western front
Gen. Falkenhayn's armies have rosuiu
ed their offensive. It is believed here
that serious riots will occur In Buch
arest when news of the loss of Rou
manians only seaport is published.
Mackeiifteu's v-asy victory at Con
stanza was due partly to the lack of
artillery on the part of the Russo-Itou-hianian
forces, it is understood here.
When Falkenhayn's guns iu the Dob
ruja were brought to the Transyl-
vanian passes, the Russians brought
infantry reinforcements into the Dob-
ruja but were unable to bring adequate
artillery equipment.
The drive to victory over the Rou
manians is expected to stifle the ef
forts of the allien to win the armed
support of Greece.

amount $063.30 was paid in by Chick
asha owners and $1087.20 was paid in
by people in the county residing out
side of Chickasha. One fourth of the

NEGROES
BY U.S.
In the court of E. Hamilton, United
States commissioner, yesterday after
noon, Ernest Moore, a negro conduct
ing a place at Second and Minnesota,
was bound over in the sum of $1,00;
to await the action of the federal
grand jury at Muskogee on the charge
of selling whiskey to two Indian boys,
one of whom is in attendance at the
public schools, here. These two boys
are said to have been robbed, one of
$106 and the othr of $30, although
this feature did n?t enter into the
prosecution, being a state offense.
Moore has not given bond and !s now
reposing ii the county jail.
An amusing feature of the trial was
that Judge Hamilton had intercepted a
letter telling how some of the witness
es had arranged to testify and the
consternation of the negroes that was
caused by the r ommissioner's manner
of procedure was comical.

jority Want Hard-Surface Highways
but Balk on Million Dollar Bond
Issue for County
TAKE MORE TIME
TO THINK IT OVER
Will Meet Again in Month and in Mean
time Committee Will Get Estimate
; on Cost
Receding from the position taken at
the meeting two weeks ago, the good
roads boosters of Grady coiwity who
met at the city hall here last night,
balked on a million dollar bond issue
for roads and bridges, voted down two
other propositions, went on record for
hard-surface roads and wound up by
deciding tm take another month to
consider the matter after appointing
a committee to secure additional esti
mates on the cost of a system of such
roads and to report at the next meet
ing.
Rush Springs was represented in
tho meeting by a big majority and
practically every man in the delega
tion of twenty or more had his hard
surface fighting clothes on. Cross
township, Middleburg, Minco and oth
er towns were also represented and
a few citizens of Chickasha were pres
ent. A motion to ask the county commis'
sioners to call an election for voting
on a million dollar bond issue was
lost by a vote of more than two to
one and. another motion by Alger Mel
ton calliug for an issue of $000,000 for
such roads and necessary bridges was
also voted dovn by a small majority.
A motion by J. W. Kayser, providing
for a bond issue of from $250,000 to
$300,000 for sand and clay roads and
necessary bridges was rejected almost
unanimously. The motion going on
record for hard-surface roads was
adopted by a small majority.
Just before adjournment a motion
by Henry Mileur of Rush Springs,
amended by Mr. Mellon, was adopted,
calling for another meeting at the same
place r i Monday evening, Nov. 20,
and appointing a committee to secure
estimates on building one hard-surface
road across the county north and
south, one -east and west through
Chickasha, one east and west through
tho southern comniissionar's district,
the route to be selected by the people
of that part of the county, and one
r-'t ar.ci west through the northern
commissioner's district, the route to
be similarly selected, a report being
made at the next meeting.
. In the absence of Dr. R. Jj Gordon
of Ninnekah, president of the Grady
County Good Roads, association, Vice
President A. L. Evans of Rush
Springs, presided over the meeting.
At the opening a report on the tax
levy required to pay interest and cre
ate a sinking fund on a bond issue of
$1,000,000 was presented, showing that
for 25 year bonds at 5 per cent, on the
basis of the present assessed valua
tion of the county, about $23,000,000,
the levy required would be 3.9 mills,
or $3.90 on every $1000 of property.
K general discussion followed. C. W.
Harper of Rush Springs reported that
the people in his part of the county
were almost -unanimous for lfrd-sur-
face roads. County Highway Engineer
Colby gave an estimate on the cost of
sand and clay roads ,in this c6unty,
the amount being approximately $700
per mile with about $500 per mile for
grading, etc. He said the cost of ma
cadam would be about $2500 per mile
in addition to the cost of grading, etc.
Henry Mileur was strong for the mil
lion dollar bond issue. F. M. Mosier,
of Minco, said the vcters, would not
stand for such a tax levy and urged
that good judgment be used. "Let
ut forget about hard surface roads
and build good dirt roads," said he.
Stanley Lee " of Cross town
ship, said the people in his section
wero almost unanimous against a
county bond issue but ould vote
township bonds. John Coyle, jr., of
Rush Springs, who is a rural mail car
rier in Cross township, said he found
no such sentiment as was reported by
Mr. Lee. A Middleburg man was also
in favor of action by townships. A. L.
Evans was enthusiastic for a county
bond issue and K, H. May, of Civ-s
township Buld ho believed a $250,000
"bond issue would bo approved; he
wanted at least one good roud across
tho county.
Mr. Kayser said he believed from
sentiments expressed by people from
various pin ts of the county that "an
Issuo of from $250,000 to $.'100,000 for
sund and clay roads and bridges would
carry but a $1,000, 000 bond issue was
out of the question. Judge N. M. Wil
liams said ho would rather see ten
miles of permanent roads built than
many miles of dirt roads but there was
no use to talk about voting a million
dollurs. J. K. Schow wanted hard
surface roads and suggested that $500,
00O be voted. Mr. Melton suggested
$OOJ,000 as sufficient for bridges and!
for one good road across tho county
north and south and three east and
west. Dr. Hamilton of ltush Springs,
suid, "Wo ought to do well what wo
do. I am willing to vote $1,000,000."
J, G. Mays suid by the time the far
mers go through paying for expensive
rfoads they wouldn't want them, draw
ing a comparison with tho Chickasha
paving. "The people of Chickasha
won't vote even $300.oo0," said he. Mr.
Melton took isHue with Mr. Mayes in
regard to the attitude of Chickasha
toward good roads. "The people here
will approve a bond issue of any rea
sonable amount," said he. W. D. Har
graves said if there was one part of
the county that ought to be In favor
of good roads it was Chickasha. "Tle
business men of Chickasha have lost
more by failing to get trade because
of bad roads than the paving cost," he
declared. Conde McGinley, too, disa
greed with Mr.. Mayes.
A'fter the vote on the various propos
als were taken, Mr. Mileur said,
"These meetings are doing good.
We'll keep on talking till vva get to
gether and then we'll do something.
It is only by such discussions as this
that we can ever arrive at an agree
ment on what we want to do.''

"People generally seem to have two

Brooks was the chief speaker of the

"Tho first of these mistaken ideas,"
he said, "is that the work of a univer
