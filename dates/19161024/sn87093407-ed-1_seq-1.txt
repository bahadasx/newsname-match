i believe that a public official or a private citizen
who has gone wrong, and who has repented that wrong,
should be allowed to come hack. I believe that the
efforts of the repentant sinner to return to the fold of
moral and political righteousness should receive en
couragement.
But this is not the issue in the Root case. The
issue in the Root case is that Judge Root is an unre
pentant sinner. The issue in the Root case, the issue
that untits him for election to the bench, is that he has
given no public indication that he has recanted his most
serious offenses against moral, political and judicial up
rightness.
I do not refer to the fact that he resigned from the
bench under fire.

Mate's Protest
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Oct. 24.—Rev. John
Wesley Dickens is on the way to recovery to
day from a bullet wound he says he inflicted
in an attempt to commit suicide in order to
teach the world that preachers are under
paid!
Altfeo the shot did not prove fatal, Rev.
Dickens has expressed belief that thru his
act the nation will be aroused to an under*
standing of the poor treatment of ministers
who, he says, have to live better than their
incomes permit.
Mrs. Dickens justifies her husband's act*
despite the fact that his death would leave
her and their four children without his sup
port.
"I feel that if Wesley'i life is the price he and his family
bad to pay to improve living conditions for preachers he is
justified," ahe savs.
"Would you l>c willing to work to support your children
if your husband died as a result of his act?" she was asked.
"I believe we >hould be in the hands of the Lord," she re
plied. ...
Kev. Dickens received $100 a month. '/ i
"It take* m much food for ■ preaehar and his • J
family as for any other family," says Mrs. Dickens. "J
"A preacher must always be well dresaed. He always
is expected, and forced, to contribute to many char* f"
ities. This money comes out of his salary.
"Hi- wife must have proper clothing. She entertains andl
is entertained a great deal. Naturally, she moves in the best
society in the community.
"Despite the strict economies we practiced, our salary al
ways was exhausted before it was received."
In a note Dickens wrote before shooting himself, he ex
plained the agony of the life thru which he had to go.
""I have *lept but little this week and this little has been
frightful dreams." ho wrote. "Have not relished a meal in m
vcrk. My thoughts are ha?y, my mind is dazed. I believe I
would be stark crazy in another week, a grief to my family, a
burden to society and a misery to myself."
The four Dickens children range in age from seven weeks
to six years. ,
HOPES HIS ACT WILL
SLAY GOD'S ENEMIES'
This note was written by the Rev. John Wesley Dlckene
before he shot himsslf:
"The tragedy of an overworked, underpaid, debt-increasing,
mind-distracting, heart-crushing preacher, who, as a husband,
father and citizen, giving himself to the ministry of others, and
could not keep living expenses within his income, and Is crushed
and crazed with humiliation at the pressing needs of his pre
cious wife and babies, for which he sees no adequate aupply.
"This will be Inexpressibly tad to the dearest, sweetest,
truest wife a husband ever had, and to the four darling little
children, but. by the grace of God, they can survive It, and It
ought to help thousands of other poorly paid, qualified preach
ers and their families to receive Increasing salaries at least In
keeping with the Increased cost of living.
"It will take something extrsordinary and awful to bring
negligent churches to the sense of their duty in this matter, and
if this sad occurrence can do this. It will greatly advance the
cause of Christianity, and I shall not refuse to pay the pries,
and shall trust that, like Samson of old. this last act of my Ufa
may slay more of God's enemies than all the previous acts com
bined."
