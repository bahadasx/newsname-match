BANK CLERK S CASH
WOMEN'S VOTES
I
NVw Vork. Oil. 24. Four nilllloii
women's votes are nut to bo snecseri
at thla presidential year.
The two big parlies admitted thla
frankly today, aud aald (hey are turn
ing every poaalble attention to wooing
the suffragette ballot.
Each aide claimed the majority of
the women would be for them, but
each was just aa frank in admitting
that It'a hard to tag women votera
and that there'll be mnch independent
voting. .
Aa the republican woman's branch
put It, "The women will not vote aa
their husband, brothera and sweet
heart do."
The democrat camp aald, "Suffrage
will not be a determining factor. Wo
men will reaaon for themselves and
vote as they see At, though we be
lieve they will see that Wilson Is their
beat hope."
They are very earnest folk the
women campaigners. A few around
headquartera of both parties looked
as though this hunt for the elusive
vote might be a fad, but for the most
part they had their coats off and were
hustling.
Both aldea are making a big drive
on strictly economic questions, argu
ing that what affects men also affects
women.
Workers at' Hughes headquartera
were busily engaged In mailing out a
list of questions for women to pon
der. Involving, largely - matter of
higher living coats, tariff and the like.
Their circular suggested, too, that on
strictly women's and children's mat
ters the 0. O. P. had been the more
favorable.
Around the corner, nedr the Graftd
Central station, the democratic wo
men were Just as busy malting out
literature to prove (hat the children's
bureau, the commission on Industrial
relations, the child labor bill, and
even the federal reserve act and rural
credits measures are big arguments
why Wilson should have tha women's
vote. ,
The atates where women 'vote are
Idaho, Washington, California, Ore
gon, Arizona, Wyoming, Kansaa, Illi
nois, Coloradd, Alaaka, Montana and
Nevada. ' Illinois' leads with about
800,000 votes, while the whole regis
tration totala about 4,000,000.
