WHSON'S OWN
FIGURES Afl
Administration Statistics
Show How War Has
Made Our Prosperity.
AND AFTER THE WAR
WHAT WILL WE DO?
"Think it Over" is Admoni
tion After the Undisputed
Count is Shown.
New York, Oct. 24.—William R.
Wlllcox, chairman of the Republican
national committee, Bays: "Every1
American, be he farmer or manufac
turer, employer or employe, capital
1st or wage earner, owes it to himself
to give some study to the character
and extent of the exports and imports I
of the United States during the last
few years. Their significance in con
nection with the present prosperity
is highly important. These figures I
have been compiled by officials of the
Wilson administration so there can be I
no controversy regarding their au- Expect
thentlcity. I
"Much has been said about the
extent to which the European nations
are preparing to compete for the
world's trade as soon as the present
war is over. Look at these figures:
In 1914, this country exported |14,
000,000 worth of metal working ma
chinery. in 1916 it exported $61,
300,000 worth.
"In 1914 we exported $115,500,000
of machinery of all kinds, in 1916,
we exported $182,700,000 worth
What better proof could there be of
Europe's determination to be indus
trially prepared
"Out in Missouri there is, accord
ing to all reports, prosperity in these
sections. Our export figures show the
reason. In 1914 we exported zinc to
the amount of $406,208. In 1916
we exported zinc to the amount of
$45,867,000. Some of the fiercest
fighting in Europe is around and about
the zinc mines, where all work has
been suspended. But what of the
time when the war ends and mining
is resumed.
What About You Farmers.
"Farmers are enjoying their share
of war prosperity, and there's a rea
son for it. Somewhere between 15,
000,000 and 20,000,000 European men
are fighting under their respective
flags. Not only have they abandoned
all effort at producing but they them
selves must be fed. Consequently,
our exports of breadstuffs, amounting,
in 1914 to $165,300,000, jumped to
9486,$96,000 In 1916:'
"And our exports of meat products,
•mounting to $148,261,000 in 1014,
jumned to $266,795,000 in 1916.
"Armies require horses and mules,
so our exports of horses and mules
which In 1914 amounted to $4,000,000
Jumped to $98,500,000 In 1916.
"Horses and mules must eat and
consequently our exports of hay,
which in 1914 amounted to $827,205
jumped in 1916 to $3,267,000, and
our exports of leather, both manufac
tured and unmanufactured, amount
ing to $67,466,000 in 1914, reached
the enormous total of $146,613,000
in 1916.
"I could go on at length and quote
official figures which clearly prove the
reason for our present prosperity and
the fact that it Is dependent on the
continuance of the war, and that,
without proper safeguarding legisla
tion, it will end with the war, but too
many figures are confusing. I will
add one more set, which Is of vital
significance.
"In 1914 our imports from Euro
pean countries other than the central
powers, amounting to $634,291,000,
In 1916 the Imports from the same
countries amounted to $599,245,000
and England and France, despite the
fact that they are fighting for their
lives, sent to this country in 1916
exports amounting to $410,522,000.
The falling off during the war in the
exports from these two countries has
amounted to only $25,000,000. If the
Wilson-Underwood free trade law Is
still in force when the war ends what
do you think will be the amount of
exports which those two countries
alone will send to the United States?
"Think It over."

"PAN-AMERICANISM
Argentine Consul General at Petro
grad Says Europe Has Drifted
Far Back.
New York, Oct. 24.—The necessity
of true Pan-Americanism is the lesson
which the war teaches to America, de
clares Bruno Cittadini, the Argentine
consul general in Petrograd, who is
here on his way from the Russian
capital to Buenos Aires
"I am home again, and I think of
this entire hemisphere as my home,
to preach Pan-Americanism, to urge
all Americans to take heed and learn
from Europe's terror," said Mr. Citta
dini.
"This war has taught me what I
hope it teaches all the nations on this
side of the Atlantic, the necessity of
true Pan-Americanism. I believe the
United States realises the opportunity
that Pan-Americanism offers.
"I have the honor to be one of the
Argentine commission who entertain
ed Mr. McAdoo, the United States Sec
retary of the Treasury, when he was
in my country, and I have absorbed
some of his enthusiasm.
"Europe has drifted so far back,
morally and economically, that it will
take her many generations to regain
her stability."
