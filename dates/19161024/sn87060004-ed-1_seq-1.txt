HUGHES EXPLAINS
VIEWS OH MEXICO
Declares That Our Citizens
. Must Feel Humilated by Our
Policy in Mexico
The November Woman's Home
Companion prints an article by
Charles E. Hughes, Republican can
didate for President, In which he
says:
"Aside from suffrage, .there are'
great questions now be'ore the peo
ple in which I believe the women of
the country are deeply interested We
desire the American name to be re-
spected throughout the world, We
cannot achieve this if the rights of
American citizens are not unflinch
ingly maintained.
"It is not the question of the esti
mate of the worth of A or B as indi
viduals, but of the rights of American
citizens as such. American citiztn
ship is not a cheap thing, and from
the moment we ignore our national
duties in maintaining the rights of an
American citizen, however humble we
shall decline in national strength and
fall into nationol dissteem. In this
connection we should consider well
conditions in Mexico and our respon
sibility to neighboring states.
"During the past few yeors vile in
dignities have been visited upon our
flag. Our citizens have been murder
ed; their properties destroyed. This
chapter in our recent history cannot
be read witeoutasenseof humiliation.
We desire .to give every practicable
aid to bleeding, starving Mexico, We
desire that Mexico shall.have a stable
government and we sympathize with
the aspirations of her people. But
the rights of American citizens must
always be fearlessly maintained.
"If we would have the respect of
. other nations, we must respect our
selves. Firm insistence on our known
rights is an essential condition of
lasting peace and security. This js
true in our dealings with all nations.
We have no policy of aggression. We
are desirous to have the friendship of
all and I believe our friendship is de-
sired in turn. But friendship must
have its secure basis in mutual re
spect. We must not invite insult by
-exhibiting weakness and vacillation."

taining ten cents, arc pouring
into the'lccal'poitoflic daily from
women in various parts of the
country who have joined in an
"endless chain" schemo promoted

To every woman who would
send ten cents in silver and
write five friends urging them to
join in the chain, tho "Exchange"
promised a "new 1017 model
silk petticoat."
"The volume of mail for tho
exchange' is rapidly growing,"

and today we received twenty-
five thousand letters, enclosing
twenty-five thonsand dimes.
Thousands of the letters have
been returned to the writers, but
a large majority carry no return

letter office is becoming clogged."
No Newspaper
In Todd Gounty

would agree to buy the other's inter
est. Receutly Mr Roper is said to
have filed suit in the circuit couit to
have the partnership dissolved, and
hence tbe paper has gone out of bus

This leaves Todd county, which for
yesrs has had from two to four news
papers, without any.
