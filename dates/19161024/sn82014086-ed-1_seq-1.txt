RAILROADS NOT OPPOSED
TO STATE COMMISSIONS
Their Attitude Defined by the Presi
dent of the C, B. & Q.
Chicago, Oct. 23. The attitude of
the railroad interests toward state
railroad commissions was defined here
today in a statement By Hale Holden,
president of the Chicago, Burlington
and Quincy road and chairman of the
railroad presidents' committee In the
recent trainmen's controversy.
He denied that the roads were seek
ing the destruction of the state boards
but said the roads would like to place
exclusive control of all questions un
der the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion or some other federal body.
"First in importance," he said, "is
the rate -making power. Forty-nine
state commission? making rates and
rules for the government of interstate
carriers is rapidly lending to "confu
sion and much unnecessary expense
to the carriers. Forty-nine states re.
quiring many different standards of
operation would bank-apt an average
railrop.d and mean nothing to the pub
lic except the bad results coming from
lack of uniformity.
"State railroad commissioners have
their legislative field, but all matters
that have an interstate effect should,
in our opinion, be the. subject of fed
eral control."

sociology, the European war, the Em

DEMOCRATS TAKE RELIGIOUS CENSUS
Republican National Committee Has Evidence of Its
Use for Political Purposes
"SUITABLE LITERATURE"
Branded as a Scheme to Make
Religious Prejudices Follows in Wake of a Special Ap
peal to Jews to Support President Wilson Because He
Had Appointed a Jew to the Supreme Bench and Done
Other Things Favorable to Jews Letters Marked "Con
fidential" Are on Stationary of the Democratic National
Committee.
New York, Oct. 23. The republican
national committee has received evi
dence that the democratic camDaign
managers are undertaking to effect a
religious census for political use at
the very time that for public consump
tion they are vociferously decrying the
injection of the "religious issue" into
the campaign. It was only a short
time ago that Henry Morgenthau,
chairman of the democratic finance
committee, sent out a special appeal
to Jews to support President Wilson
on the direct purchase and sale argu
ment that Mr. Wilson had appointed a
Jew to the United Skates supreme
court and done other things specially
favorable to Jews. Now comes this
religious census, avowedly laying the
groundwork for a new appeal that
will be differentiated according to the
results of the census. The democratic
managers want to know the religious
affiliations of the voters so that "suit
able literature"' may be sent to them.
The scheme is not even thinly veiled.
It is a bald attempt to make political
capital out of any strong religious pre
judices which the proposed census may
reveal to the democratic national com
mittee. Some time ago the democratic
national committee sent out to post
mesters everywhere copies of a docu
ment entitled the "Wilson workers'
manual." Now this is followed, nat
urally, by a flood of letters to demo
cratic "workers" asking their help in
taking this religious census. These
letters are marked "Confidential" and
are on stationery of the democratic
national committee, dated at New
York, and sent fro mthe ofhee of
"Daniel C. Roper, chairman of organ
ization." .'.This Is the man who was
first assistant" postmaster general iTn-
NEW HAVEN REPUBLICANS
HOLD FfRST BIG RALLY.
Taft, McLean, Bannard and Holcomb
Make Addresses.
New Haven, Conn., Oct. 23. Local
republicans held their first big rally
of the campaign in a theatre tonight
and a packed house listened to ad
dresses by former President William
H. Taft, Senator George P. McLean,
Otto T. Bannard of New York and
Governor Marcus H. Holco'mb. The
affair was under the auspices of the
republican town committee and the
Yale Republican club. Preceding the
speaking there was an old-fashioned
torchlight parade through the center
of the city. Several hundred Yale
students and a Hartford marching club
were in line.
Mr. Taft presided and was given a
great ovation. He spoke briefly on
the nation's prosperity, which he at
tributed to the European war, and said
"We are living in a fool's paradise"
created by the sufferings of the Euro
pean people. He quoted statistics
showing the effects of the Underwood
tariff bill and contrasted these results
with what the Payne bill of the pre
vious administration had achieved.
Mr. Taft also referred to the Adamson
bill, which he characterized as a
measure of legislation by intimidation.
' Senator McLean delivered the prin
cipal address, criticizing the adminis
tration's foreign policies and the lack
of military preparedness- He men
tioned the recent visit of the German
submarine U-53 and pictured what he
believed would happen in the event of
sudden hostilities were a fleet of un
dersea boats to visit our coast.
He criticised the democratic party
for claiming the distinction of having
devised cer'ain reforms, particularly
those with reference to the banking
laws, which he said originated in the
minds of republican congressmen.
Many of the state's most prominent
republicans were present at the rally.
Senator Frank B. Brandegee was to
have spoken, but his address was' omit
ted owing to the lateness of the hour.
New Haven members of the Lincoln
Wideawakes of 1860 occupied promi
nent seats in the theatre.
16 MINE WORKERS CAUGHT

Pottsville, Pa., Oct. 23. Sixteen
mine workers were caught behind a
wall of fire in a gangway of the Sus
quehanna Coal Company's Lyttle col
liery at Minersville today and rescue
corps worked until late tonight before

FOUND IN THE WOODS,
Was Taken from the Home of Miss
Mary Cheney of South Manchester.
.South Manchester, Conn.,,' Oct. 23
About $300' worth of silverware, a part
of the loot taken by thieves from the
home of Miss Mary Cheney here about
two weeks ago, was found yesterday
in some woods not far from the house,
wrapped in . a. tablecloth which had
also been stolen from the house. This
discovery has led the police to believe
that the break was by local persons
rather than by outsiders. About $600
worth of silver was taken in the rob
bery. Only the larger pieces of sil
verware, which could not be carried
away easily, in pockets were found.
FOR VARIOUS SECTS
Political Capital Out of Strong
til this campaign opened, and who re
signed that post 10 take the job as
part of which he sends out this appeal
for a religious census. Mr. Koper
writes that he wants, for the demo
cratic national committee, "the names
and addresses of any persons Who
should have persoanl letters or . to
wrom appropriate literature should be
mailed." Mr. Roper adds that he is
sending certain "special lists" on
which the worker is to transmit to the
national committee "the names of any
doubtful voters (in accordance with
the headings cn the sheet) to whom
letters should be written or literature
be sent." The special list Is a blank
divided into two parts, each contain
ing seven columns. One is headed
"republicans, progressives and inde
pendents favorable to Wilson." The
other is headed "other republicans,
progressives and Independents who
through appropriate literature may be
persuaded to vote for Wilson." At the
top of each of the seven columns is a
caption describing the information de
sired. These headings are: 1, politics;
2, name; 3, postoffice; 4, occupation;
5, nationality; 6, religion;' 7, disturb
ing issue, if any.
The covering letter from Mr. Roper
makes it clear to the worker who re
ceives it that the demoratic national
committee will regard him suitably
for his efforts. The democratic na
tional committee has waited until the
last weeks of the campaign to attempt
this special injection of religioua is
sues, with the obvious purpose of
avoiding detection if 1 possible. Mr.
Roper is not as open in his- appeal to
religious prejudice as his colleague,
Mr. Morgenthau, but their purpose la
juet the same.
