A Hughes Estimate
By Organized Labdr
"Now that Governor Hughes has retired
from politics and ascended to a place on the
highest judicial tribunal in the world, the
fact can be acknowledged without hurting
anybody's political corns that he was the
greatest friend of labor laws that ever occu
pied the governor's chair at Albany."

New York State Federation of Labor, October 10, 1910.

the next governor's coming visit to
the county It Is certain that a large
crowd will go from here to attend the
rally.
Mr. Johnson's speech was one of
tin. most brilliant political addresses
ever heard in the city. His scathing
arraignment of the blunders of the
Wilson administration was wildly ap
plauded. County candidates who
epok* predicted success for the tick
et. ind several prominent members
of the club expressed the opinion
thut Hughes and Robinson would be
elected by overwhelming majorities.
A tolored quartet composed of
Professor D. H. Pyle, Dr. W. It.
Johnson, Clark Walker and John
Strange rendered several vocal se
lections, which were very much en
Joyed. A pleasing Instrumental duet,
mandolin and guitar, was given by
