Refusal to Convene Parliament,
Two Men Wounde Before the As

Occurs In a Hotel.
Vienna, OcL 23. Dr. Frederich Ad
ler, who killed the Austrian premier,
. Count Karl Stuerghk, declares that
tho assassination was political and
was induced by'the premiers refusal
to convene parl.ament.
Dr. Adler, uho Is under arrest. Is an
eccentric and radical Socially some
times known as "the Lieuknecnt ot
Austria." Ho is editor ot Der Kanipf.
jit l.rst ho decllueJ to reveal his mo
th es, bit after being loekcJ up ho
broke down and declared the pro
m.er's political policies had led him.
to do the deed.
Dr. Adler"s arrefat was not accom
plished without the wound.ns of tvn
ment, who leaped at him attcr he had
fired on Count Stuerghk, He dis
charged the two remaining chambers
of his reolvcr at theso men before
Austrian and German officers, wita.
drawn sabers, overpowered him.
The wounded men, who we're In
jured slightly, are Baron Ashrcrithal,
brother of tho Iato foreign minister,
and the iiead waiter of the Hold
Meiscl and Schadn. in which tho
shooting occurred.
Count Stuerfhk arrived at the hotel
at 1:30 o'clock. With aim at lunch- on.
were Baron Achrenthal, Count log
penburg, governor of the Tyrol; Herr
Jacobson, a prominent Vienna must
clan, and an actor from the Court
theater,
i At 2 o'clock a man unknown to the
premier and took a seat three tables
away. He ate luncheon and paid for
the meal, but lingered at the table.
Shortly after 3 o'c'ock he arose, ad
vanced quickly toward the premeir
and fired three shots. Tho first missed.
The next two struck the premier la
the head. Without a word. Count.
Stuerghk fell back lifeless in his chair.
Paron Ae'hrenthal sprang toward
Ad'er. The head waiter ran up from
behind the assassin and grasped tfoo
hand that he'd the revolver. Ad'er
wrested h's arm free and fired two
shots. Paron Aehrenthal was wound
ed In fee foot. The waiter received,
only a superficial wound.
Seeing tr,t tho struggle was hope
less. Dr. Adler surrendered to the offi
cers who crowded about htm. and
gave up his revolver. Atmarently he
was the ca'mest man In the room. He
pave (lis name without hes'tat'on and
added: "If vou p-'ease. gentlemen. It
know perfectly well what I have-donft
I shall not res'st arrest."
The assassin, who is thirty-twor
years old. Is a son of Dr Adler, a
rcichsrat deruty and a Socialist ot
