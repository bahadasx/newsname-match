' tions Generous
Superintendent of Public '.Works
Forbes, acting as a private citizen, has
laised $3X)0 among Honolulu business
men and firms to contribute toward
tbe Rapid Transit Company's expend
of $800.0 in relocating its tracks on
Kalakaua avenue.
He- baa offered this sura to the
transit company and is ready to go
out and get another thousand, if
necessary, to hasten the Kalakaua
avenue improvement. Notification, of
the sum he has raised was placed be
fore, the 'street railway directors to
day In a letter from Forbes and at
the same time h' conferred with tins
directors.' This was Just before noou.
, Shortly before 2 o'clock he decline J
to discuss this morning's meeting and
would give out no information as to
bis offer and successful efforts. to get
up a public subscription. He did say,
however, that the situation was "de.
veloping favorably" and that he -would
ask that a special meeting of the
board of supervisors be called for 4
o'clock this afternoon, at which in
formation would be laid before the
city fathers , -
These are the developments' in a
situation whicli seemed almost dead
locked a few days ago, when, after the
city had decided, to contribute half of
the $8000 expense pr relocating the
KaJ&iaua i emu e -tracks," Deputy City
Attorney Cristy declared such action
by the-municipality would be illegal
and that the city attorney's office
would be forced to enjoin the board.
With this,, and the fact that the
superintendent's ofiice was concerned
in any track relocation, the tleadlock
' was -put up to Forbes. He responded
by. the move of going out and raising
by public subscription what would am
ount to the city s share.- .
Points Out Need .
In his letter to the street railway
directors, he says: ;
"At a conference yesterday between
your board .and the superintendent of
public works, it developed, as the
sense of the session that no work of
such importance ought to be under
taken while there remained- any
chance of legal uncertainty on the
right to prosecute it ..An injunction
suit might tie up the whole project in
litigation for n : indeterminate pe
riod. - Accordingly I voluntered to
raise the' money for you in my indi
vidual capacity, as a . private citizen
and the results appear below. It
would have been nothing short of a
calamity to hive allowed Kalakaua

PARTY RALLIES

Asking for only a few minutes at
each of their rallies in which to pre
sent a plea for, the bond issue, Daniel
Logan, chairman of the bond commit
tee or the board of supervisors, has
sent letters to both WV A. Bryan.
. chairman of the Democratic, commit
tee, and Harry Murray, acting chair
man of. the Republican committee.
The letters are identical, each re
questing 10 minutes be allowed at
the party rallies for a speaker chosen
by the committee, who will tell the
people what the bonds are for and the
good that will result if passed at' the
election November 7. The letters alto
assure the party leaders that the dis
cussion will .be entirely non-partisan,
the-4 purpose of the request being sim
ply to secure a means of. reaching the
Ieople for clear and lucid discussion
on'-the merits of the bonds, .
The answers to the letters will Ik
awaited with keen interest, as -the Re
publican party. has already refused one
suiervisor permission to speak on
the ground that it might result in a
partisan issue, but as tho" letters ask
permission for speakers to appear at
the meetings of both parties, thut
argument' cannot be advanced.

E. D. Tenney Says That Just as

Study of Political Conditions
Convinces Him That Wilson
Will Be Reelected
Edward D. Tenney, fi'rst vice-president
and manager of Castle & Cooke,
Ltd.; returned in. the Wilhelmina from
a seven weeks' visit in California with
some interesting observations and
pertinent statements on politics and
shipping such as "Wilson will prob
ably be the next president" and "pas
sage of freight from the mainland to
Hawaii may be more congested than
ever due to removal of -the Lurline."
Limited tonnage may hold many auto
mobiles for here on the mainland.
Despite his Republican faith Ten
ney believes that Hughes will not win
the race. Although the Honolulan talk
ed with businessman on the main
land who are in close touch with the
political situation and who declared
Hughes would win after a hard Bght
be did not feel that way after he had
summed up the general situation in
his own mind.
Pre-election Quiet Unusual
"There is a spirit of peacefulness
and content evident on the mainland,"
says Mr. Tenney, "which is not com
mon before election. There is no ap
parent excite, money is plentiful and
free and the people generally are sat-'
isfied. The one fact that the usual
pre-election throttling down of Indus
try has not taken place is one of the
surest, indications to me that the .peo
pie are 7 not seriously contemplating
a change in lodgers at the White

Accident Inopportune
The Lurline accident came at a
most inopportune time, according to
Tenney, for the freight congestion
which has existed to a more or less
extent for several months on ship
ments . to the territory had been re
cently relieved and was showing signs
of disappearing entirely before the big
Matson boat scraped on the rocks. Now
there, may be more of a tie-up on
.freight than before.
Luxuries Must Wait Delivery
"Disabling the Lurline will likely
mean that residents here will have
to postpone the receipt of luxuries, es
pecially automobiles," predicts Ten
ney. . "The cars have already been
discriminated against when tonnage
became particularly scarce this year
and certainly they will be again. The
Lurline will probably not be in the
service again sooner than four weeks
and in that time the San Francisco
docks will be piled sky high."
Charter Rates Nearly Prohibitive
Tenney says it takes a good deal of
love and a lot more money to obtain
a ship on the Pacific coast or any
where else of any kind. When one is
secured the charter rates are almost
prohibitive. However, he admits that
ships are obtainable from time to time
if shippers are willing to pay the price.
Mrs. Tenney; who accompanied her
husband on the trip, remained in San
Francisco for a longer visit Tenney
spent all of his visit in the vicinity
of the Golden Gate.
