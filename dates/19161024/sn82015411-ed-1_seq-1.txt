.Mr, Hughes, was taken ill about,

the immediate trouble. The appen-

had caiised an abc,css on the liver
nnd the latter resulted in j death.

Mr. and Mrs. John A. -Scott,, of
llilo, fafher and mother of Mrs.,
Hughes; Mrs. Hughes and tlio chil
dren accompanied the body to Ho-'
noliilu.
The deceased is survived by Mrft.
Hughes, two children, mother,, a
broiher and a sister. k
The funeral of tne late Mr. Hughes,
took place from Central Unioi
church in Honolulu on Sunday,' in
terment being in Nuuanu cemetery..
Richard Lyon Hughes was.born
at Fresno, Cal., Dec. 5, 1883. Ho
was educated in California schools
and afterward completed a business
course at Poughkecpsic, New York.
He. iwas first connected with' the
Weed Lumlwr Co., at San Francis
co, for three years as bookkeeper
and cashier, and for six years be
fore coming to the Islands was locat
ed at Portland, Ore., as purchasing
agent and in charge of 'tho oflice of
the Weed Lumber Co.
He came to the Islands on, a,, va
cation trip, and on the steamer'jnct
Miss Margaret Scott, of Hilo, who
became his wife in June, 11)13. In
place of returning to the coast,
therefore, Mr. Hughes became as
sociated with the Kauai Railway
Company, at Eleele, as cashier and
manoger of the merchandise de
partment. While in Portland, Mr. Hughes
was prominent in music circles, he
possessing a splendid baritone voice.
On Kauai he has been prominent
in church, social and business life
and was highly esteemed by every
one fortunate enough to know him
well.
Tho two bright and interesting
children left fatherless are Richard
Lyon Hughes, Jr., aged two years
and five months, and Margaret Vir
ginia Hughes, aged five months.
The death of Mr. Hughes cast an
unusual gloom over the entire is
land. A meeting of the Chamber
of Commerce, of which he was a
member, scheduled for Thursday,
was postponed for a week on ac
count of it, and social functions all
over the island were called off.
The Second Battalion
Major. Gaylord P. Wilcox will
probably confer with Colonel Rroad
bent tomorrow regarding 'changes
to be made .in stall" officers of his
battalion. It i s not yet known
whom he will chooso for battalion
adjutant. Report has it that Lieu
tenant Horner will probably lie pro
moted to a captaincy, although
nothing ofiicial has been given out
about it.
Hallowe'en Party

Hallowe'en party at Papalinahoa
the Wilcox beach place at Nawili-
wilil next Saturday evening, cards

T
E
The regular semi-annual conven
tion of tho churches of the island
tnct as guests of the Lihue Hawaii-
an church for a three days session
this last week. Much less of the.
time was given to church reports
than usual, and more to the consid
eration of business and to the dis
cussion of important themes of
spiritual signiflcenco. Among the
items of business thoso that awaken
ed special interest .were : The grow
ing desecration of Sunday. The
ovils of the liquor traffic and, the
need of prohibition, the passing
away of the Hawaiian minister and
Wlio "will take his place, etc.
There wate a prevailing convic
tion that most of these evils and
jnany others could be cured by
sending the right men to the legis-
laturc-and these men -were the
Hawaiian ministers.
The central theme of the distinc
tively religious discusion was the
spiritual awakenyig of the churches.
iuiss luaDci wneox oy special re-i
quest read a very instructive paper
on simple hygiene for the home,
which commended itself to the con
tention and which will be printed
for circulation among tho churches.
, TJie next convention will be held
at Hanalei in April.
In connection with the conven
tion the Hawaiian Board contin
gent Messrs. Judd, Erdman, Scud
ilei' and Akano in conjunction
with Mr. Lydgatc, have made an
evangelistic tour of the island, ex
tending from Hacna to Waimea.
JERVES FINDS THE
MADEIRA POTATO
The Honolulu Star-Bulletin prints
the following:
An interesting feature of the out
side work being done by tho U. S.
experiment station is -that done by
col laborators or farmers who live
on the other islands and because of
their better knowledge of fanning
have been chosen to give what ad
vice they can and also keep their
eyes open for any variety of plants.
J. DcC. Jervcs is the collaborator
on, Kauai and recently he found a
new sweet potato, which since has
giyei splendid results when planted
m other sections of the islands.
,lt is known as the Madeira sweet
potato. It is already established on
all the islands, but others, accord
ing to Jervcs should obtain cuttings
or plants and set them out in order
that their neighbors may see them
and, in time it will be'the standard
sweet potato of the Hawaiian Is
lands, as its quulity deserves.
Not only is its eating quality ex
cellent, but it is also uniform in
size and will keep for a'considerable
period, making it, a perfect market
ing vegetable for those who wish to
sell the surplus stock.
Mrs. E. A. Knudsen received a
message yesteulay that her mother,
Mrs. POrange, had ai rived safely
in New York. Mrs. rOnyigo was
in Berlin when tho war broke out
and has just succeeded in leaving
Germany. She will arrive on.KauaiJ
in a few weeks.
Tax Assessor J. K. Farley and
wife, of Koloa, and Frank Crawford,
of the Lihue bank,' arrived in Ho
