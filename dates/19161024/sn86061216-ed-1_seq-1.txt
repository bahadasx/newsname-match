cepted $250 for procuring restoration
of Gaynor's saloon license and a con

FOR PEACE LEAGUE
Lord Grey Gives Approval to Ameri

Wars in the.Future. ^0*
Lory!
on, Oct. 23.—In an important
speech at a luncheon given by the For
eign Press association today, Vis
count Grey, British secretary for for
eign affairs, expressed approval of
American movements for'a league af
ter the war to maintain peace. He de
clared, however, that the nations
which went into such a league must
have a public sentiment prepared if
necessary when a critical time came
to uphold their decision by force.
The foreign secretary referred to
German utterances regarling peace,
and the claim that Germany must
have guarantees for her future pro
tection and added:
"Precisely because this- war was
forced by Germany upon the world, it
is the allies who muqt have guaran
tees."
Viscount Grey said the best thing
neutrals can do for civilization is to
work up sentiment for a mutual agree
ment to prevent such wars for the fu
ture.
"Had there been an international
conference of all nations in 1914,'' he
declared, "It would have prevented
this war as they would have demanded
that Belgian neutrality be respected.
This is work for neutral countries up
on' which we would look with favor
and approval."
ASSASSIN NOT SANE
Austrlans Think The 8layer Of Ths
Premier Is a Crank Without .a,
Any Backing.
Vienna, Oct. 22, via London, Oct. 23.
—Government circles here regard tlie
killing of Premier Stuergkh of Aus
tria as an act of a political crank
which can in no wise influence the po
litical situation or thfe course of the
war. This statement was made to the
correspondent of the Associated Prese
in high responsible quarters. It ia
pointed out that the' time which has
elapsed since the murder has shown
that Dr. Friedrich Adler, the assassin,
stands alone. His act is disavowed by
the socialist party and press and con
demned by his father, Victor Adler,
socialist member of the lower cham
ber of the reichsrath.
Adler stated to the police that he
shot Stuergkh because the premier op
posed the convening of parliament. It
is stated officially that Stuergkh had
at no time done this and that he could
not do it because the convening of par
liament was a matter la the hands of
the political parties.
The Austro-Hungarian press brands
Adler as a vile, irresponsible criminal
and without exception deplores the
fact that the act of a crazy man should
disturb the peace of the peopl^. The
city is quiet. The public, while na
turally greatly inte'resteS, regards the
murder as a purely private crime.

Chicago, Oct. 23. —Senator Oscar
Underwood of Alabaiha has thrown a
monkey wrench into the machinery in
his speeches In Indiana, according to
advices received at western republican
headquarters. Chairman Will H. Hays
of the republican Btate committee of
Indiana, in a statement yesterday as
serts consternation among democrats
followed Senator Underwood's talks.
He says:
"Democratic leaders of Indiana are
in a blue funk as a result of Senator
Underwood's flat refusal to stultify
himself in his speaking tour of this
state. —11
"He was told in advance that It was
desirable that he pay special attention
to the Adamson law, but the manner in
which he did
BO
has caused consterna­
tion in the democratic ranks. He sim
ply declared in his Indiana speeches
what he declared in congress that the
law is not an eight hour law at all, but
a wage raising law passed to avert a
strike. This was the only defense he
made of it and his words fell like a
wet blanket on his audience.
Democratis Try to Curb Him.
"Fort Wayne is an Indiana railroad
center, and Senator Underwood, pre
vious to speaking there in the evening
spoke in the afternoon at the little city
of Auburn, where he frankly referred
to the Adamson law as a wage raising
measure passed to meet an emergency
"I am advised that a large delega
tion of Fort Wayne politicians took the
matter up with the senator and em
phatically told him that in Fort Wayne,
he should call the law an eight hour
law, as his audience would he com
posed largely of railroaders who had
been invited especially to hear him dis
cuss this statute.
"Senator Underwood heard the dele
gation's declarations and remarked: "I
think, gentlemen/ that I understand
you perfectly." That was all.
His Talk a Bomb 8hell.
But when he spoke In Fort Wayne
the fact that the Adamaon law ha!
nothing whatever to do with the hours
of labor and that it was simply a law
to increase wages, passed to tide over
a serious situation. He said:
'"We were confronted with a situa
tion that threatened the welfare of the
entire country. The brotherhood men
would not arbitrate and there was no
way that congress could enforce arbi
tration except by the use of a bayonet.
Something -had to be done to s»ve tlie

to the railroad manager: 'You can pay
the men 25 per cent more and we will
provide a commission to find out
whether you can pay It out of your
present revenue.' That Is all there
was too it
"The speech Is voted a calamity by
the local democracy, for It vindicated
completely the republican contention
as to the Adamson law and gave the
lie direct to President Wilson's claim
that his support of the statute was
based on principle rather than expedi
ency."
