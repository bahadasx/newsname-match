T.R.DECLARES
President Who Keeps
Him Unfit for His

CALLS SLURS ON
HEROESNAUSEOUS
Declares Wilson's Silence
Shows He Ranks Villa
with Washington
[Pr?*t> a StafT (Vim?ip<m'1rT,t if T * Tribune 1
Alburjuerque, N. M., Oct. 23.?Colonel
Roosevelt moved u crowd of 3,000 to
cheers and laughter here to-day by
branding Newton I>. Baker, Secretary
of War, as a man "exquisitely unfit for
his job."
"I understand he knits very well,"
the Colonel said after asserting that
Mr. Raker, as an amiable pacifist, could
probably have rendered "resprctable
service along other lines." There was
nothing facetious, however, in Mr.
Roosevelt's condemnation of the Secre?
tary of War's recent Jersey City speech
in which he advised persons who could
not understand President Wilson's
Mexican policy to read the "Declara
tion of Independence and the Golden
Rule."
"The man who professes such doc
trines," the Colonel said with unusual
emphasis, "is wholly unfit to May in
the Cabinet, and the President who r%
tains him is wholly unfit to remain the
President of the United States."
"NauseooB Hypocrlsy"
The Colonel read The Tnbunr.'s
stenographic report of Mr. Baker's
speech, then dropped his manuscript
and said, slowly:
"The flnal touch about the Golden
Rule, applied in comparing men who
rape women, murder children and tor
ture wounded soldiers to the signers of
tho Declaration of Independence and
th. singularly humane aoldiers of
Washington, adds an element of nau.ae
ous hypocrisy to as preposterous and
ridiculous a slander as ever was cir
culated about the men of the Revolu
tion.
"This statement of Mr. Baker, acqui
esced in by the silence of Mr. Wilson,
shows that Mr. Wilson in his heart be
lieves that Washington was no better
than Villa or Carranza; that the men
of the Revolution stood on a level with
the miscreant crew who dunng the
last three and a half years II Mexico
have murdcred Americans by the hun
dreds and Mexicans by the ter.s of
thousands. These men have perpetrated
every Kpec.es of outrage upon women
and children and have turned all
Mexico into a hell of starvntion. disease
and misery; they have done this with
the active or passive assistance of the
American government under the leader
ship of Mr. Wilson, and his Cabinet of
ticer now defends them by th. fouleat
slander on the men who made us a na
tion."
Misrepreaent Pacts.
"When men occupy an improper and
unpatriotic position and seck to justify
themselves by precedents from the past
it is almost impossibl. for them to
avold misrepresenting the facts they
desire to quofe in their favor.
"If President Wilson's behavior toward
Germany, and especially toward Mex?
ico, if his attitudes in both our inter
national and internal uffairs are proper,
then Washington, Jackson and Lincoln
artcl (aapreperly in upholding and sav
ing the Cruori and del'ending our posi?
tion against foreign nations by their
readiness and ability to use foiee.
"Mr. Baker is an amiable pacitlst,
who, I do not doubt, could render re
npectable service along other lines, but
he is exquisitely unfit for his present
position. He is by no means as astuto
as Mr. Wilson, but he is more sincere
and htraightforward.
I'nderatands Nothing of War
"He eertainly understands nothing
of efticiency in war, and it is now ap
purent that he regards all wars as
standing on the same level of mfamy
and all -oidiers as equally disreputable.

GREY URGES
PEACE LEAGUE
AFTER WAR
Says Nations Must Be
Prepared to En
force Plan
ALLIES EXPECT
AID OF NEUTRALS
Will Welcome Suggestions
to Prevent Future
Wars
London, Oct. 23. The Allies welcome
efTorts by neutrals for a combinntion to
pre-. ent future wars. This was made
plain by Viscount Grey, Secretary for
Foreign Affairs, in a speech to-day be?
fore the Foreign Press Association.
Diplomatic representatives of all the
Allied countnes were present.
"I believe the best work neutrals can
do for the moment is to try to preven*
n war like this from happening agair..
If the nations had been united in such
an agreement and rrompt resolut'.on t.>
insist in 1914 that the dispute must be
referred to a conference or The Hague,
that the Balgiaa treatjr must be ob
served, there would have been no war,"
he said.
"N'ation.- 'itrhting for 'he.ir existence.
with daily increasing pro-peets of 8BB
iag vietory hrought nearer, still know
ing that if th>*y stop short of vietory
they stop nhort of every thing for which
they are struggling, cannot he expecte.l
to apend much time thinking ab<>ut
what migh! happen after vietory ia se
cured. But the neutrals can do it.
"I observe that not only President
Wilson, but Mr. Hughes, is ?upporting
a league started, not with the object of
interfering with the bclligerenta m thia
war, but which will do its part in mak?
ing peace sec'.re in the future.
Force Must Re Factor
"It is a work of neutral countri"S to
which we should all look with favor
and hope. Only, we must bear this in
m:n<i: if the rotons kfter the war ar*
able to do somethlng effective by bind
lag themselves with the cummon object
of preserving peace, they must be pre?
pared to und'Ttak. not more than they
are able to uphold by force, and to see,
when the time of crisis comes, that it
is uphelu by force.
"The question we must ask them ia
this: 'Will yo,i play up when the tini ?
comea ?' lt is not merely the sign man
uai of presidents and rovereigns that
is really to make this worth whi>; it
must alsc have behind it pariiament-*
and national sentimer.t'.
"Sappoaa the conditions of 1914 oc
cur BgBln and there is tuch a league :
in axisteaee. everything arill Jepend on
whether national tentiment behind it
Ia so pereaeeted by the leaaeaa of this
war as to jompel ;ach nation, as a mat
tei af dtal lateteeti to keep peace
other than by force."
Alliea Won't Discuss Peace
The Foreign Secretary made i* plain
that the Allies were not prepared to
discuss peace terms, and gave no indi
cation of what their terms might be.
"I would like to talk not, indeed,
atout actual conditions of peace," Grey
said, "which can only be stated and
formulated by the Ailies together, and
not by any one of them separatelv, but
about the general obiects which the
Allies must secure in this war. And to
do that, I would ask you to recall that
we must never forget how the war
came about. If we are to approach
peace in a proper spirit it can only be by
recollecting and recalling, and never
for a moment forgetting, what was the
real cause of the war.
"You cannot go back to it too often; J
it affeets the conditions of peace. Ger
manv talks of peace; her statesmen
talk of peace to-day. They say: 'Ger- \
many must have g-uarantees against be- !
ing (ittacked again.'
"If this war had been forced upon
Germanv that would be a logical state
mer.t. lt is preclsely because it was
not forced upon Germanv, but was
forced by Germany upon Europe, that
it is the Allies who must have guaran
tees for future peace."
Blames War on Germany
In July, 1014, contlnued Viscount
Grey, no one thought of attacking Ger?
