by the American Peace Conference

to come to' Milwaukee, and offering to
pay ' their expenses for the trip, to
attend a meeting in aid of Hughes.
The World says:
Chicago, Oct., 23 The promoters
of fche German-American propaganda
which has endeavored to incite hos
tility to President Wilson ,by . many
undertakings have .called a meeting!
of Catholicpriests in the Republican
House in Milwaukee for Wednesday
next. . -. - ' ' . . ,
This propaganda, which has oper
ated under many names and aliases,
is now, known as "the American In
dependence Conference. It has been
known previously as the "American
Peace Conference" and the "Amer
ican Embargo Conference," and has
engineered several ventures of the so
called neutrality sort.
It was the American Independence
Conference which, as told in . The
World today on 1 the authority of the
Democratic National Committee, sent
a - committee to "deman)" . from
Charles E. Hughes ai explanation 'of
his approval of CoL Roosevelt's Lew7

were Jeremiah A. O'Leary, Carl E.
Schmidt and Will R. MaeDonald.

which was on the letterhead of the
American Independence . Conference
and wasssued under date of Oct. 18
from its offices in rooms 903-8, No.
139 North Clark street, this city,
aroused the resentment of one clerical
recipient, who is indignant at What
he terms a palpable attempt to , in
volve the church and its -priests in
politics., This is the letter:
Dear" "Reverend - Father: -Be-'
cause of the Importance of the
Presidential campaign, - we take
.the liberty of asking whetheryou
will be, good enough to accept this -invitation
to come to Milwaukee,
Wednesday, Oct. 25, to attend a

make It difficult for youvto make such
a trip, and were it . not for the ex
treme importance of ' this matter we
would not, ask' you to come.
""The American Independence Conr
ference feels that you should know
the real situation -and since it believes
that this is' serious you are urged to
make the sacrifice and come. Should
you h prevented from coming, please
send some; man in your place. The ex
pense of the trip wiil be paid, for we
believe that the sacrifice of your time
Is all we can ask.
"The main object of this meeting
is to remove any doubt that may exist
as to Whether all real Americans
should vote for Charles E. Hughes.

Candidate Received
Them; That's Enough,
, Says Phila. Record
Philadelphia, Oct. 24, Commenting
upon the secret political relations be
tween Candidate Hughes and his cam
paign managers and Jeremiah- A.
CLeary and his associates of the so
called American Independence Con
ference the Philadelphia Record this
morning says: ;
"Mc, Hughes received a committee
representing voters who make the in
terests of the United State second to
those of foreign countries he listened
to them, that was enough.
"In the meanwhile the 100 per cent,
candidate will make a number of
speeches. .He unaerstands that he
will get the hyphenated vote lf the
hyphenated voters like his speeches,
otherwise he won't get that. There
is no bargain, - -,There Is merely an ul
timatum. "Mr. rlughes consented to receive"
this committee, knowing what its pur.
fcose was and the speeches he has
made since show that he Is trying to
get those votes." '
Last year, and again a week after
Mr. Hughes was nominated, the New
York Tribune said tnls:
"It would be better for the Republi
can party to Indorse Woodrow Wilson
in 1918 than to permit the principal
to be established that to defend Amer
ican interests is to commit political
suicide."
