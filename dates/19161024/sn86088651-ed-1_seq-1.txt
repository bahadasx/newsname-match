Southwest, who do not know Joe
I'tay, either by reputation or by some
kind word he has spoken to them

representative who. by the way, has
known Mr. I'tay for many years, to
meet him yesterday afternoon after
the A. and M. S. M. I, game at Kyle

versation with him. Space forbids
mentioning the many good things he
had to say about different Individuals
In this city who are hla friends, and
says he has never seen a "country
burg'' come out like Bryan has.

town of this sUo being built at a cost
of a little over $ lOrt.Ofx. hardly seems
reasonable, but when you see what E.
