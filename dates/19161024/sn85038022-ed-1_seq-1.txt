reason for the doubt as to the dates
U caused by the fact that November 3n
the first announced date for the open

there is some little desire to have it

77,8t!0 Democrats. In Maine, the voters
were ((Minted at an election, and
Maine's answer was emphatic and con

both sides, and where the Democratic
managers made support of President
Wilson, the cordinal Issue. New
Jersey and Massachusetts show ex
actly the same situation. In each
State there was a Democratic contest

i each State the total Democratic vot(

I "In New Jersey, Senator Marline.

; Judge Wescott, who had the admin
istration supported against Marline
; polled 2:1,6-7; this was a hard light.
which attracted attention all over the
country because of the cITortB of
President Wilson's friends to defeat
Marline. While this bitter contcBt wan
going on there was a good mil 11 red
campaign in the Republican primaries
between Joseph Krellllghujseii and
Franklin Murphy, each of whom polled
more votes than both .Marline and
Wescott combined, Krellnghuysen won
with IMHi Mtf fur Murphy. The
total l(' public. m vote was 187,414; the
total Democratic vote 1111,513. In this
primary, the boro of Princeton, where
I'resldenl Wilson is exceptionally well
known, cast 575 Republican votes
and only 26L Democratic votes. Four
years ago al the election Wilson had
863 and the combined opposition, 706
These figures show what a change has
occurred in Wilson's home boro.
