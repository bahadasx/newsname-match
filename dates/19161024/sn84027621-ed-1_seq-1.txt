BRITISH HAVE FORCED THE
TEUTONS BACK
British front in France (via Lon
don), Oct. 24. After more than three
and one-half months of battle on the
Somme front with the greatest con
centration of artillery, infantry and
aero divisions, of war material and
the fiercest fighting, the situation has
developed the British fighting efficien
cy and means for reducing the loss of
the attackers. V
In the way of concrete achievements
the British have taken 30,000 prison
ers, or a little less than 1,500 for each
of the twenty-one villages captured,
with an average population of about
1,200 souls. They have taken 125
( guns, 1C9 trench mortars and trench
s guns and 429 machine "guns. They
have not lost a gun.
POWERFUL TRENCHES TO BUCK
The task of the British was made
especially difficult by the " fact that
they were confronted at the outset by
a most powerful line of trench forti
fications. Moreover, every village was
a fortress which had to be besieged
and stormed. The British have driv
en back the Germans on a front of
eleven miles to a depth of four to
eight miles. When spring comes
peasants will plow and seed ground
behind the lines which for over two
years had lain fallow rnder the storm
of bullts. In Fricourt and Mametz,
villages taken on July 1, trees with
their trunks torn and their foliage
blasted by shells, have bravely thrown
out fresh shoots while fresh crops of
grass are hiding the shell craters in

Meeting of the Old Soldiers
Mrs. E. L. Carney , who returned

tell the Star reporter of a few of the
many delightful things the hospitable
people of that great city did for the
comfort and pleasure of the Confed
erate Veterans and other visitors dur
ing the reunion last week. - Mrs. Car
ney has attended many reunions and
is personally acquainted with not only
nearly air the Confederate veterans
who reside in Florida, but also with a
number from other states, as she has
had the honor to "represent this state
at several .general reunions. And at
no place were the ' veterans and
friends treated more cordially nor en
tertained more beautifully than they
were in Tampa. C About six hundred
veterans were there, many Sons; a
large number of Daughters and other
visitors, all of whom were loud in
singing the praises of Tampa and her
good people. Every possible thing
was done for the. comfort and enjoy
ment of the visitors and especially
for the real guests of honor the Con
federate veterans. The welfare of the
visitors was looked after not only by
the grown people, but that noble band
of Boy Scouts wTas ever oh the alert
and always ready to lend a "helping
hand" whenever needed. There were
an hundred and sixty of these hand
some little boys, and ' most valuable
assistance did they give.
; The spacious Tampa Bay Casino
was full by 9 o'clock Tuesday morn
ing, Oct. 17th, when the opening ex-
ercises began. ? ;
Genr A. G. Baker, commander of
the Third Brigade of Florida, Dr. S.
L. Lowry. commander of the Tampa
Sons of Veterans, Mrs. Leon A. Har
rison, president of the Tampa U, D.
C. and their able committee were to
be most heartily congratulated on the
success of this meeting, "as well as the
success of all of the arrangements for
this reunion. '
The music was of the highest type,
the ': prayers and the addresses . were
gems of the loftiest thoughts. On this
program appeared Gen. Baker, Dr.
Lowry, Mrs. Harrison, Rev. I. C. Jen
kins, Mayor D. B. McKay, Judge C.
B. Parkhill, Mr. W. G. Brorein, Rev.
Junius Collier, Miss Ruth Brash, Mrs.

Drowned in the Delaware

. Philadelphia, Oct." 24. Alexander
Brown, the noted polo player, was
drowned when his hydroplane fell
into, the- Delaware river at Essington.
Brown was making his final flight for
an aviator's license. '. .'
and , Florida's little mascot, Olan
Buchanan, made a short address.
Olan is the grandson of Gen. Buch
anan and is just seven years old. His
address was, loudly applauded.
Wednesday morning about two
thousand gathered at the dock to see
the veterans and others embark on
the large steamer, Pokanokit, for the
enchanting trip down the bay. The
U. D. C. served a tempting lunch at
noon. A sweet memorial service was
also held aboard the vessel.
The 'chief event ' for Wednesday
evening was the Confederate ball at
the Centro Asturiana Club. This is
one of the handsomest of the many
handsome buildingsof this nature in
Tampa. The grand march was led by
Dr. Lowry and Mrs. Carney, ably as
sisted by Gen. Baker and Mrs. Lowry,
and Col. W. W. Best o fthis county,
and his dainty little partner, the
beautiful little eight year old daugh
ter of Dr. and Mrs. Lowry. After
the grand march, the figures of which
were quite military and beautiful, the
old-fashioned and courtly dances were
greatly en joyed. Conspicuous among
the other graceful. dancers was Mr.
M. P.t" Frink, of 'old Marion. i
The crowd at this ball was so im
mense that the doors of the German
Club were thrown open for the young
er people and the Centro Asturiana
was turned over entirely for ; the
pleasure of the - old veterans who
thoroughly enjoyed every minute of
the dance. The night was excessive
ly warm but the: musics and genial
cheer were so inspiring that the heat
was forgotten. This ball was, as was
everything else connected with the re
union, a great big success. Electric
fans, plenty of ice water and delicious
fruit punch added to the delight and
comfort of those present.
Thursday at noon came the glad
tidings that Ocala and Marion county
had been greatly honored as Gen.
Alfred Ayer , had ; been unanimously
selected and unanimously elected the
commander of the Florida division of
the "U. C. V. for the ensuing year.
Gen. Buchanan could not succeed him
self. Another bit of . news which
caused the hearts of Marion county
people to rejoice was that Gen. Ayer
had made Col. F.. E.r Harris "chief of
staff" for this state. Ocala and Mar
ion county feel ' exceedingly "proud
and Gen. Ayer and his chief of staff
are receiving many .warm congratula
tions." :'''-"" '
The parade Thursday afternoon was
