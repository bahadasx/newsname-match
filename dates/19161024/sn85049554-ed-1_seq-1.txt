ROOSEVELT LAMBASTS BAKER.
Attack on Revolutionary Soldiers
"Blackest Slander Ever Penned,"'
Albuquerque, N. M., Oct 24.—Sec
retary of War Baker was the particu
lar target for Col. Roosevelt's darts in
his speech here.
He called Secretary Baker's charac
terization of Washington's army "the
blackest falsehood ever penned."
"But it is to be expected of a. man
who didn't play with tin soldiers when
a boy," he said. "I might add here
that Mr. Baker's Cleveland friends
have wired me that he used to knit
when younif."
"When men occupy an- improper and
unpatriotic position and se6k to justify
themselves by precedents from the
past," he said in opening his address,
"it is almost impossible for them to
avoid misrepresenting the facts they
desire to-quite in their favor. *,
"President Wilson's positions and no

dent Buchanan. But it is utterly im
possible to defend the conduct of
President Wilson, save by inferential)}'
condemning the conduct of such presi
dents as Washington, Jackson and
Lincoln.
"If President Wilson's behavior
toward German^ and especially toward
Mexico, if his attitude In both our in
ternational- arid .^Internal affairs are
proper, then Washington, Jackson and
Lincoln acted improperly In upholding
and saving the union and defending
our position against foreign nations by
their readiness and ability to use force.
"If their attitude toward the army
and navy was. rights than the attitude
of Mr. Wilson
iib
appointing and main­
taining Mr. Daniels as secretary of the
navy and Mr. Baker as secretary of
war is 'wholly indefensible.
"Mr. Baker is an amiable pacifist
who, I do not doqbt, could give re
spectable service along other lines, but
he is exquisitely unfit for his present
position and would nev^r have been
appointed to it if Mr. Wilson had been
willing to look at the army from the
standpoint of military efficiency, in
stead of creating, it purely from the
standpoint of temporary expediency."
Mr. Roosevelt then quoted Mr.
Baker's speech. 0
"Comparing mefi' who rape women,
murder children and torture wounded
soldiers, to the signers of the declara
tion of independence and the singularly
humane soldiers ojf Washington adds
an element of nautfjious hypocrisy to as
preposterous" and fwtlculous slander as
was ever circulabwiahout the men of
the revolution," jfnSgRoosevelt contin
ued. "I have no ijppbt whatever that
In this astoundin^l^itement Mr. Baker
gives Mr. Wilsqnfs' real views, exactly
as Mr. Lansing ,. in« his famous note of
June last, incautiously told the exact
truth about the acts of Carranza and
the Mexican bandits generally.
"Mr. Wilson's attitude cannot possi
bly be justified except on the theory
that at the bottom of his heart he
looks upon all soldiers as equally bad,
and has no conception that Washing
ton and Carranza stood in opposite
planes of the moral and political scale.
"Of course,' from the standpoint of
patriotism, from the standpoint of any
American citizen proud of his country
and his army, It is profoundly unpatri
otic, profoundly dishonorable it, in
deed, amounts almost to desecration to
compare Washington's army, the men
of Valley Forge, who sacrificed every
thing tor their country and showed
singular humanity with the herd p/
bloodthirsty bandits who, how under
one bandit leader, now under an
other, raVaged Mexico and whom the
president has been backing and sup
porting in their ^Murders and outrages
for the last three and a half years In
Mexico.
"THb man who professed such doc-'
trinesjf is «. wholly unfit to stay in the
cabinet Mid th$ president who retains
him is Wholly unfit to remain presi
dent of the United States.
"This statement of Mr. Baker's,
acquiesced In ''by the silence of Mr.
Wilson, showri that Mr. Wilson, in his
heart, believes that Washington was
no better than" Villa or Carranza that
the rijen of the evolution stood on a

"These men have perpetrated every
species of outrage upon women and

misery.
"They have done this with active or
passive assistance of the American

Germana and Hungariana Capture
Predeal, Transylvania, After Des
perate Fighting.
Berlin, Oot. 24.—German and
Austro-Hungarian forces, after a
violent engagement south of Kron
stadt, Transylvania, yesterday
captured Predeal, says the Ger
man official statement, issued to
day. Six hundred prisoners were
taken.
Medjidie, on the Tchernavoda
Constanza railroad, also has been
captured. The army of Field
Marshal von Mackensen has taken
prisoners more than 6,700 Rou
manians and Russians.
At the Head of Predeal Pass, Rou
manian Frontier, With General von
Falkenhayn's Army, Oct. 18, by Cour
ier to Berlin, via London, Oct. 24.—In
yesterday's be.ttle around Predeal the
Associated Press correspondent vis
ited'various German and Hungarian
battery positions, where the men, un
disturbed by Roumanian fire, kept up a
ffarful bombardment in the campaign
of invasion of Rou aani&.
The men are at their work in almost
a holiday spirit, for it is with a sense
e£ deep relief that the Germans and
Hungarians nere, officers and men
alike, have left behiiid-tliem'the tl-ench
warfare of other regions and thrown
themselves into open field maneuvers
against the Roumanians.
It was scarcely believable that after
two years of life at the front infantry
men should rush to battle with songs.
Tho.the German and Hungarian in
fantrymen were about to rush into the
fire of Roumanian rifles and machine
guns,^ they viewed the situation com
placently, saying the worst of open
field wortc'Wfw preferable to trench
drudgery.
The- Predeal IjSfcue t« one-jf the few
open field actions witnessed in this
war by a correspondent, who was able
to approach within less than 3,000
yards of the skirmishing.
Roumaniana Generally (Routed.
At 11 o'clock the Germana opened a
desultory fire on the Roumanian
trenches on Susaiul mountain, 5,000
feet high "which an hour later reached
its maximum fury. The fire was then
directed mainly against the trenches
500 feet below the summit. For a
quarter of an hour the Roumanians
stuck to their trenches. Word coming
from the artillery spotters that the
Roumanians thus far seemingly had
not been impressed, the artillery in
creased Its fire. The Roumanian in
fantry still hung on for a time, but
finally broke into view. The German
artillery followed up the Roumaniana
with shrapnel.
On a ridge leading from Susaiul
mountain, the Roumanians finally
reached their second positions. A lull
ensued
a few minutes before 2 p. m.
Then it l*ras decided to resume opera
tion*. German artillery repeated the
work of the morning and the infantry
then rushed forward. In a compara.
tlvely short time the objective was
gained.
Train Guns on Town.
The ground being difficult the Rou
manians attempted to forward Infan
try reinforifemento thru Predeal. In
side of fifteen minutes heavy German
guns blew up half the town ..The Rou
'manians were forced to pass thru Ger
man fire at long range.
The battle was not marked for se
verity of artillery fire but great inter
est centers In it because German and
Hungarian Infantry, unaccustomed to
mountain fighting, was aible to cape
wltfi the difficulties of the terrain.
Roumaniana Inefficient.
The Roumanians, on the other hand,
showed lack of military knowledge.
The efficiency of their troops suffered
because much of the artillery had been
taken outs of range for fear of being
cut off. The Roumanian aftllllery,
therefore, made an unusually poor
showing. The Roumanian infantry did
relatively better but it yma at the
mercy of German and Hungarian
shells.
There was nowhere observable a
tendency to underrate the Roumani
ans, but the officers spoke frankly of
their many handicaps. Thoy said the
Roumanian general st^ff had overlook
ed important lessons of the war—as,
for instance, the absence before Rou
manian positions of barbed wire which
is replaced by shallow pits with point
ed stick*.
Infantry Shoots Badly.
Thus far the Roumanians have been
worsted eadh time" by flank movements
and the superior artillery. For a time
the Roumanians had numerical su
periority, In one Instance thirty to one.
As nearly all armies in the present
war have done, the Roumanian infan
try shoots badly, tho an improvement
Is noticeable.
The losses of the German army are
said"to have been .light .An officer of
the general staff told the correspond
ent that in the battle of Kronstadt
the losses In die
ad were less than the
number of guns captured from the
Roumanians, which were sixty-seven
