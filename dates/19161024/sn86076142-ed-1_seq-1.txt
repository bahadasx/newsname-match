WAR NEWS AT A GLANCE
(Br Aaaoelated Preaa.)
The Dobrudja region of Rumania apparently is ljung overrun
by the forces of the Teutonic allies. Constanza, Rumania's chief
seaport and fortress on the Black sea, already has fallen into the
hands of the troops of the right whig of Field Marshal von
Maekensen'a army, while the left wing is nearing the town of
Tchernavoda, where the Danube is spanned by the bridge of the
railroad running from Constanza to Bucharest. Near the center of
their front, which extends across the Dobrudja from the sea to the
Danube, the invaders have cut the railroads near Murratlar, and
pushed their troops "far beyond" the railroad line, according
to Berlin.
Before the rapid advance of the Germans, Bulgarians arid Turks
rapid despite heavy rains and soggy grounds the Russians and
Rumanians are in retreat along the entire front, but according to
Petrograd they are offering stubborn resistance.
- Aside from the operations in Dobrudja, another British smash
at the German line in the Somme region of Prance, which netted
them more than a thousand yards of trenches easfof Guedecourt
and Lcs Boueffs, and carried their front a step nearer the
Bapaume-Peronne road, is the most notable incident of the fighting
on any of the front. A gain, described by Paris as "appreciable,"
also is recorded for the French northeast of .Morval, which lies
just to the south of the region where the British and the Germans
were on contact.
Berlin, in touching upon the fighting against the British Sunday
between Le Sara and Rancourt, says the attacks of the entente allies
were sanguinarily repulsed. It is admitted in the German official
