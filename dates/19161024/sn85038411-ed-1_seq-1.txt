WILLCOX SEES
GOLD BRICK IN
8-HOUR LAW
Permits Companies to Work
Men 16 Hours if They
• Sec Fit, He Says
MEANS WILSON'S DEFEAT
Men Will Turn Away From
Him When They Examine .
Legislation
Washington, D. C., Oct. 24. What
has become known as the "Goldbrick"
Eight-hour law insures the defeat of
Wilson and the election of Hughes,
acording to a statement made by
Chairman Wlllcox of the Republican
National Committee.
W. Jett Lauck, economic expert and
chief statistician for the railroad
brotherhoods, is quoted Dy Chairman
Willcox to prove that the railroads
may still work a man sixteen hours
under the terms of the so-called eight
hour law. Mr. Wlllcox analyzes the
bill and asserts that:
"The Wilson-Adamson wage increaso
bill will do more than any other one
thing to defeat President Wilson's am
bition to succeed himself. If the Presi
dential election had been held imme
diately after the passage of the Wil
son-Adamson bill, when the labor men
of the country believed it was what
Mr. Wilson said it was —an 'eight-hour
bill'—Mr. Wilson might have had a
chance to get a considerable percent
age of their votes but with sufficient
time intervening to enable the labor
men to analyze the legislation and in
vestigate its effects for themselves, all
tho support which labor may have
been disposed to give him will turn
to opposition.
Not an Eight-Hour Hill
"In the first place, it is not an
eight-hour bill. W. Jett Lauok.
economic expert and chief statistician
for railroad brotherhoods, is one of
my authorities for the statement. Mr.
Lauck says:
" 'The Adamson law does not. sub
stitute hours for distance or miles as
a basis of payment. Therefore, the
railroads may work a man sixteen
hours —without violating the Adamson
bill.'
"William J. Pinkerton, member of
Lodge No. 752, Brotherhood of Rail
way Trainmen, who came within six
votes of defeating W. G. Lee, for the
presidency of that organization, says
that is Just what they can do. Mr.
Pink'erton says the railroads will not
contest the Adamson law because the
so-called eight-hour day which simply
means a reduction of over-worked
agreements from ten hours to eight,
reserves to the companies the right to
work employes up to sixteen hours
should they see fit to do so.
"What kind of an eight-hour law
is that'.' Mr. Wtlson may have suc
ceeded in palming a gold brick off on
the presidents of the railway brother
hoods, but he can't deceive the men
they represent once they get a chance
to examine the legislation for them
selves."
Auto Bandit Who Stole
