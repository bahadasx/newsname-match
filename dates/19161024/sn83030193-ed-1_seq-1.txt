Announcement of tho plan by John J. Dillon, Btato Commlsiloner ot
Foods and Markets, closoly followed tho publication of concessions by the
llorden and other distributing ogonclcs by which consumers may buy mills
directly from dualcti at 2 cents a quart less than tho established price for

In addition the Uordcn concern ar-'f
ranged to put '-to effect a cot-, on

of tho dealers arc dropping wimu of

This oan only come about with

advocated by the anoclation, a
Milk Service Commission, similar
to the Public Service Commlsdon,
could be established, and every

Referee Recommends Absolute
Decree for the Former
Mrs. Gouraud.
A .Supremo Court roferco to-day
recommended that n docrco of abso
lute dlvorco bo granted to Princess
Almco Crocker Gouraud Mlskliioff
from hrr youthful husband, Prlnco
Alexnmlor MI!;lnorr, Kusslan noble
man, whom she secretly weddod In
London In 1911. Justlco Oreonbaum,
to whom tho rofcrco's roport was sub
mitted, In all probability will grant
tho docrco xlnco tho Prlnco, who
fought tho suit at tho prlvato hear
ings, offered no opposition to his
wtfo'n plea for freedom.
Tho Princess will retain hor title,
but, according to hor attorney, John
C. Oldmlxon, will drop Into Hecluslon
Immediately.
"Tho Princess will not marry ngaln
If I read her mind rightly," aald Mr.
Oldmlxon to-day. "Sho wants to draw
tho curtain botween hor llfo with tho
Prlncu and tho futuro. All sho seeks
Is solitude."
"Anil as to tho Prlncu?" tho lawyer
wns asked.
"Hu will go his way and, as he Is
young, good looking nnd of lively dis
position, ho will soon forget this little
Incident In his llfo nnd remarry," thu
lawyer replied.
"And little Yvonne, tho adopted
daughter of tho Princess, what will
become of her?" was aski'd.
"The dainty llttlo Yvonne Is not with
her foster mother now," Mr. Oldmlxon
sold. "She has been In tho country
ever Rlnco the separation suit, also
resting, and I do not know whether
she will return to the Princess."
It was Yvonne, seventeen and at
tractive, who brought about tho sep
aration suit last March when her fos.
ter mother dcclnrod that her royal
blooded husband paid more attention
to hor thau to tho Princess,
following the discontinuance of the
separation stilt tho Princess and her
hiiNbnnd und Yvonno patched up
their differences and tho royal pair
moved Into a suite at tho Hotel Neth
erlands. All was happy until last
May.
When the Trlnre lnlstrd on llv
Ini; on the flour beni'.ith the Prin
cess's suite, and .til alone, tint referee
was told, the Princess Mispectod that
another woman had again entered
tnto Ids life. Sho sent Yvonno to tho
country and asked ono of her men
acquaintances to follow tho Prince.
A professional dejeetlvn and the ac.
qualntanee zigzagged about the cllv
In a taxlcab, trading tho Prlnco nnd
lln.illy entered his suite without even
the formality of a knock.
Tho Prince, according to tho testi
mony, was attired very much en dls
hablllo and a young, dark-halred
woman was reclining In baby liluo
silk pajamas on a divan.
The woman screamed, the witnesses
declared, and Jumped Into a closet.
Tho Prince muttered something In
French about his honor bilng at
stalxi and thm nttneked the two
men. After a frec-for-uli list light
wldch brought hotel employees to thu
room, tho raiders disappeared.

Tho Incrctiso of $."0,000,00 over the
