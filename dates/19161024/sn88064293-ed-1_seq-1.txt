I« die Insuring Public
The trouble and expenses incur
red by the Local Insurance Agents,
because of their inability to collect
their premiums, and the frequent
losses by non-payments has become
so much of a tax on their business
that they have found it necessary to
limit all credit for premiums to 60
days from date of policy. Hereafter,
satisfactory settlement must be made
within that time, otherwise the policy
will be cancelled, for such non-pay
ment.

BIG SERIAL COMING
TO NEW THEATRE
■ V 1
minus j
In announcing the booking of
"Gloria's Romance" for the new
theater, Manager Davis believes that
; he has arranged for the best film at
: traction for his patrons that money
I can secure. Billie Burke, the fascin
ating international star, has been
secured as the star of the produc
tion, though it took a salary of 1
$4,000.00 per week to induce the J
titian-haired Billie to place her ;
! name on the dotted line of a con
j tract calling for her appearance in j
; the story. The scenarG of "Glor
Romance" originated in the
! of those famous novelists, Mr. and
I Mrs. Rupert Hughes, wh~- are known
j to people everywhere through their
successful stories in the Saturday
Evening Post, Cosmopolitan Maga
zine and the Red Book, for nearly
everyone has read "What Will Peo
ple say?" "Clipped Wings" or "The
Thirteenth Commandment"—and
Mr. Hughes himself has declared
that "Gloria's Romance" is the best
of them all.
As for the film production of the
j Hughes tale, it need only be men
; tioned that the story is being staged
! at the George Kleine studios , to'
' guarantee its merit, for the public I
■instantly recalls such wonderful at- !
! tractions as "Quo Vadis?" The Last i
! Days of Pompeii," "Sparticus" and |
j other equally famous, when the 1
: name of George Kleine is mention- !
|ed. Never before, in fact, has a mot-J
j ion subject combined to such a de- j
■ gree the best in the way of stars, the
best in the way of authors and the
best in the way of producers that
make "Gloria's Romance" stand out
from the ordinary run of photo
play productions. Names like Billie
Burke, Mr. and Mrs. Rupert Hughes,
and George Kleine stand for all that
is supreme in the field of art, litera
ture and motion pictures, and the j
conbination of the three should re
sult in an epoch-making production.
The screen novel will set an ab
solutely new standard in lirerary
merit of motion picture stories, for
it is not to be a blood-and-thunder,
slap-dash, knock-dow^-and-drag-out
tale, but a logically developed, care
fully plotted, interest-compelling
tale of the romance of .1 voung soei
etv woman. Miss Burke in her role
of Gloria Stafford, tn > daughter of i
a New York banker, appears as a j
useful and vivacious girl, bubbling |
over with good spirits and cheerful-1
and her love for Richard Fron- I
cau, a young broker whom «be meets 1
while wintering at Palm Beach I
fascinating mystery develops when
Frenoau suddenly disappears and 1
Gloria sots out to discover what be
comes of him. The story opens at j
fashionable Palm Beach and later I
scenes are laid in the, homes of the j
wealthy along Riverside Drive, Now
York. During the production Miss
Burke wear a score of especially
designed gowns from the studious
of Henri Bendel, Lucile and Balcom,
and in this respect feminine patrons
will find the film a regular fashion
bazaar.
"THE CHILDREN'S HOUR"
Miss Elizabeth O'Brien was the
attractive little hostess on Saturday
afternoon, when she entertained at
the regular meeting of The Child
jren's Hour. The life of £ir Edwin
Landseer was prepared and r°ad by
L. J Adams. Two of the artists pic
tures were discussed by the club.
Landseer will be the continued sub
ject for the next meeting. Great
artists is this year's work in this
club.
WHY ONIONS ARE WHOLESOME
The fact that onions are now be
ing supplied raw to the troops in
France may come as a surprise to
many people who despise this vege
table. Dieticians saythat most people
do not realize that the onions is
of great value as a food, and that in
it are found some of the most valua
ble and tonic minerals salts in the
vegetable kingdom.
Onions are said to be the best
known as a cure for insomnia; they
also possess such cooling and diure
tic properties that they prevent and
soothe the pains of rheumatism.
Physicians say that onions are
easily digested, stimulate the appre
tite, and the nourishing. They con
tain sulphur and other properties
which stimulate the activity of the
stomach and aid the digestion, and
are preventive of human parasites.

i to this city from his birth-pin e w.th
! his parents when he was quite young
land the balance of his life w°.-; spent
! here. The deceased had many do le
friends here and his last hours were
soothed by the attention bestowed by
some of the most loyal among them
Decedent was in former years an
attache of some of the largest con
cerns and businesses operated here
in the earlier days. In his youth he
was an athelete and was always an
ardent follower of all outdoor sports.
It is said that his health and
strength were finally effected
by the exposure to which he was
subjected in certain positions he held
and that his decline has been marked
for a number of years. The deceased
had but recently been appointed as
local Oyster Inspector but his state
of health prevented him from taking
up the work actively.
C. A. Johnson is survived by his
father, Mr. O B. Johnson, who is the
only one left of the immediate fam
ily. 'Other relatives of the deceased
are living in this city.
