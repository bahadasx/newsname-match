DRAINAGE SYSTEM,
WOULD RECLAIM
31,000,000 ACRES
A. L. Crocker of Minneapolis, chair
man of the All-Minnesota Develop
ment association, and Dr. F. W. Sar
deson, Federal expert geologist, who
have been working under the direc-
and Sunday
These experts are making a gen
eral survey of the entire state for the
pose of obtaining comprehensive
data on floods, drainage and the
peopling of 31,000,000 acres of Min
nesota land which will be presented
to the state legislature at the com
ing session. The total area of Min
nesota includes 51,749,120 acres.
The plowed land aggregates 19,400,-
000, and there is a considerable per
centage of lakes. The plan which
the All-Minnesota Development as
sociation has in mind is to reclaim
all of the land that is now idle and
put it under cultivation, thus in
creasing both the wealth and the
population of the state.
Mr. Crocker stated the plan con
ceived by the association will reclaim
at least half of the state land. He
said that the annual crop mad live
stock produced on the land of this
state now totals !l 500,000,000, but
that this can be doubled by carrying
out the drainage work. This sum, he
said, would be raised to at least ?1,-
700,000,000 by the improvement of
the waste places incidental to the
larger project. He said that the as
sociation has secured the services of
Mortimer G. Barnes, the engineer em
ployed by the New York construc
tion committee, who has been in
charge of work costing $100,000,000.
Mr. Barnes will return to Minnesota
about Nov. 10 to go over the project
further and to visit the northern part
of the state. Later he will return to
tell the legislature what the drainage
will do for the state.

CANADIANS WANT UNDERWOOD TARIFF
Canada Voted Down Reciprocity and
Now They Have All the
Benefits.
By George F. Authier.
Chicago, 111., Oct. 24.(Special)
The dismal record of business fail
ures in the panic years of 1893 and
1894 have stood for many years as
a danger signal to Americans and a
warning of what Democratic admin
istration of the nation's affairs sig
nifies.
It remained for another Demo
cratic national administration to
break the record established in 1893-
4, the first Democratic administra
tion since the one then in power.
Many Failures.
There were more commercial fail
ures in the six months' period fol
lowing the taking effect of the Un
derwood tariff bill than there were
in the six months' period in 1893
following the start of the panic and
the incumbency of the Democratic
administration.
In 1893 the Democrats took over
the conduct of affairs on March 4.
In the two business quarters that fol
lowed there were a total of 7,214
commercial failures. Of these 3,199
came in the quarter consisting of
April, May and June and 4,015 came
in the quarter consisting of July,
August and September.
In 1913 the Democrats, again in
power, put the Underwood tariff law
in effect in October of that year. The
first full quarter following was Jan
uary, February and March, 1914.
There were 4,826 commercial fail
ures in that quarter. In the next
quarter, April, May and June, 1914,
there were 3,717 failures, or a total
of 8,543 for the full six months. This
was 1,329 in excess of the failures
in the black period of 1893_above re
ferred to. Also this record was made
war began.
Not Distributed.
That the "war prosperity" has not
been as widely distributed as the ad
verse effects of the Underwood tariff
have been, is indicated by the com
plete reports of commercial failures
for the full years of 1914 and 1915,
when the Underwood tariff had sway.
War prosperity made millions for
some, but failures increased to a
point thaf make the figures for 1893
and 1894 look small.
In 1893 there were 15,242 failures
and in 1894 there were 13,885, a
total of 29,127 for the two years.
In 1914 there were 18,280 fail
ures and in 1915 there were 22,156,
a total of 40,436 for the two years.
That is the business showing under
two Democratic administrations and
the worse of the two is the one
Which endeavors to Claim that it has
produced prosperity.
Worst Record of All.
A real comprehension of what
Democratic administration fheans to
American business may be had by
reviewing the commercial failures.
In the panic year of 1893 the total
of failures was 1.28 per cent of the
business concerns of the country.
Not until 1898, when Republican
policies had steadied the country's
business affairs did the percentage
of failures fall below the mark of
one per cent of the total business
concerns in the United States. And
with the sole exception of 1908 the
percentage of failures did not go
above the one per cent mark until
1914, when the percentage leaped to
1.10. In 1915 it ascended to 1.32
per cent, the worst record of all. It
is this figure that shows the vaunted
"Wilson prosperity," enjoyed by those
who benefit from European war or
ders, is not reaching the big bulk of
business of the country.
These are the percentages of fail
ures in the past 24 years: 1892, .88
1893, 1.28 1894, 1.25 1895, 1.09
1896, 1.31 1897, 1.26 1898, 1.10
1899, .81 1900, .92 1901, .90 1902,
.93 1903, .94 1904, .92 1905, .85
1906, .77 1907, .83 1908, 1.08
1909, .87 1910, .83 1911, .88 1912,
.98 1913, .99 1914, 1.10 1915,
1.32.
Canada Watchine.
Congressman Albert Johnson of
Hoquam, Wash., recently returned
from British Columbia where he made
inquiry as to the great free trade
business now being done by Canada
with the United States. Mr. John
son brought back with him editorials
from Canadian news and trade papers
in which fear is ppenly expressed that
the people of the United States will
elect an administration which will
restore tariff to the articles in which
Canada is now doing free of duty a
thriving business in the markets of
the United States.
Mr. Johnson brought back figures
to prove that for eleven months,
ended May 31, this year, Canada sold
in the United States within a few of
as much lumber products as the whole
United States told in all the world.
The actual figures for eleven months
ended this year are:

Mr. Johnson says, "Canada voted

afraid our people will act with good
judgment."
