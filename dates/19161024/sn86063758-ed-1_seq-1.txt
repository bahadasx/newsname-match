HUXTER-DEWALT SCHOOL
HAS FIXE OPEXIX*
The Hunter-DeWlalt school had its
opening on Mand-.iy, October 16. A
number of the patrons came out to
give encouragement to the teachers

Rev. S. V. i5anenune ana uie rve*. u.
M. White. Mr. T. M. Mills was also
present and made a talk to the school.
Mr. W. B. Boinest a trustee and
member elect to the legislature also
spoke words of encoragement to the
school.
The enrollment at the opening o!
the school was something over 70
and there will be many more as soon
as the farm work is caught up with.
The enrollment the last session was
more than 80 and it is expected this
session that it will reach close to
100.
This is a rural graded school and
has three teachers, Mr. D. L. Wedaman,
Misses Lottie Lee Halfacre and
Ich. Mae Setzler. The people of the
community take just pride in the success
of the school and it is doing a
good work in community development.
The trustees are W. B. Boinesi,
P. Richardson, E. T. Werts. Thev

lively interest in everything that is
for the development of the communis.
The Southern railway has eliminated

idea because the road has been where
it is for so many years that it would
be almost criminal to change it. With
the number, between Newberry and
Prosperity the wonder is that some

COI MY TEACHERS HOLD
A PROFITABLE XEETIXG
I '
The first meeting of the county teach- j
' ers association was held in the high |
| school building 011 last Saturday
! morning at 11 o'clock.
County J=]^erintendent Barre in|
troduced Dr. James P. Kinard, who j
mads a talk on Compulsory Educa-1
tion.
T!io speaker first answered the ar- j
i ciiinrontc nciialK- arivanppri against
compulsory education and then drew
j some interesting facts from the cenj
sus report of 1910 bearing on this subject.
In that year every state in the union
had some form of compulsory attendance,
except the following: Alabama.
Georgia, Florida, Mississippi,
South Carolina and Texas. In 1915
the legislature of South'Carolina passed
an optional compulsory attendance
law.
Shaking of white illiteracy in the
various states, the speaker stated
I
that in South Carolina for the period
of 1H00-191O the per centige of white
illiteracy was 10 per cent. Onlyj
j Louisiana had a greater per centage.'
The speaker referred next to the!
great awakening in education in!
Xorth Carolina and Tennessee.
In 1907 North Carolina passed a
compulsory attendance law and this
had the effect of decreasing the white
illiteracy in that state. The decrease
in North Carolina for 1900-1910 was
43 per cent, in Tennessee ior uie
same period was 35 per cent; while
in South Carolina the decrease was
only 4 per cent.
But there will be another story,
said the speaker, when the census report
for 1920 is published.
A great deal is now being done in
South (Carolina to reduce the illiteracy.
A. great many night schools have
been organized and many of the
school districts have come under the
provision o? the compulsory attendance
law.
Thp law was nassed in Februray,
1915, and by November of the same
year Dillon county reported that 20
districts out of 25 had accepted the
law.
At the same time Newberry reported
8 districts. There are more districts
now in Newberry under the
law.
But in November Last there were
1887 school districts in South Carolina,
and up to that time only 131
had accepted the 1&W. This leaves
much to be done and presents a large
oDnorctunity to all the teachers of
the state.
After the talk of Dr. Kinard the
association went into an election for
officers for this year. The following
officers were elected:
President, James P. Kinard.
Vice-president, J. M. BedenbauglL
Secretary, Miss Sudie Dennis.
Members Executive Committee:
Prof. S. J. Derick, Mrs. W. C. Morris.
The association will meet at Newhorrv
sit thp hie'b school building ev-1
ery Saturday morning at 11 p'clock.

J. >*. Leak One of the Heirs to Many
Millions.
Greenville. Oct. 18.?J X. Leak, the
well known farmer and real estat?
man of Gray Court has received information
to eftect that he may
scon become heir to a portion of a
large estate now being settled in England,
according to news received here.
Mr. Leak's grandfather, James
Leak, immigrated to America -about
75 years ago and settled in Laurens
county. Two other brothers came to
America at the same time, one settling
in North Carolina and the other in
Texas. After reaching this country
the three brothers soon lost trace of
a fourth brother who remained in

brother still in England became quits
wealthy and died, leaving an estate
valued at several millions.
Recently Mr. Leak and other relatives
in Texas have gotten in touch
with attorneys *in England who are
quite certain that they are^ the
rigrhtful heirs of the fortune which,
was left unsettled because of an unAffnrf

ants of the deceased.
Mr. Leak has forwarded photographs
of his grandfather as well as
information which he believes
will be of value in proving his claim
to a share of the fortune.
