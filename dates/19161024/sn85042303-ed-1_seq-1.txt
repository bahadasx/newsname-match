HOLD MEETING YESTERDAY AF
TERNOON AND HEAR REPORTS
OF IMPORTANT COMMITTEES.
DEPOT QUESTION SETTLED.
Tho directors of the Chamber of
Commerce met yesterday afternoon
for the purpose of hearing reports
from several important committees
and suggest future plans for the wel
fare of tho city. The transporta
tion committee was tho first t re
spond with the following rapori:
'We your committee on iransporta
tion recommend that a permanent
macadam toll road be built from
Ardmore to the oil fields an! that
papers of incorporation for an amount
sufficient to construct the road be
immediately filed and work commenc
ed at the earliest possible moment.
We your committee will, if this !s
approved, get to work on disposing
of the stock and building t lie road."
(Signed) Wirt Franklin, chairman;
J. E. Hamilton, B. A. Simpson, Bar
ney Feagin, Denny Fitzgerald, mem
bers of the committee.
In making the report Mr. Franklin
stated that regardless of any railroad
facilities to the field this roid
should be built and that if the board
of directors approved of the plan r.e
and his committee would "do the
work" The report was Immediately
adopted.
The matter of accepting the revis
ed plans )f the Santa Fe depot wis
disposed of by accepting the ."oport
of tho committee which favored It.
I. M. Putnam, however, vigorously
opposed acceptance, still maintain
ing his original position that the de
pot should be larger and built wlt'i
a view to meeting future condition?.
Considerable time was consumed on
this matter, but when the final vo'e
was taken Mr. Putnam was tho only
one to vote No. "It's not a matter
of opposing the Santa Fe. That road
deserves the utmost consideration
and gratitude of this city, but .ve ("o
not have to surrender a principle to
do this. I think yet that we cou 1
show them where they could give us
a much better and commodious struct
ure at little extra cost."
The band committee headed by Ar
thur Adams made its report and r.r.k
ed that the Chamber of Oommo ce
guarantee the committee $2. .""() a

UNITED STATES ARMY'S ARMORED CAR

The first armored railway car ever
built for the I'nited States army was

proving grounds. The car, which is of
forty tons, mounts on its top one 3- j

GQ AFTER ALL
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO DRIVE
RECKLESSLY PAST SCHOOL
HOUSES WHERE CHILDREN ARE
LIABLE TO INJURY.
For some time Superintendent C.
V. Richards of the city schools has
been hoping that drivers of automo
biles would use a little precaution
when passing school buildings, in or
der that they might not Injure chil
dren who were on their way to school,
but inasmuch as the reckless ones pay
little or no attention to the safety of
others, yesterday afternoon he (ap
pealed to the police department and
in the future there will be a lot of
surprised Individuals baled in the city
court for reckless driving.
Assistant Chief of Police Will Fra
sher assured Superintendent Richards
yesterday that ho would personally
see that the speeders would be ar
rested and further Bee that when
they were brought Into the city court
and fined tuat that fine would not be
remitted.
The city attorney has been instruct
ed to draft an ordinance covering the
traffic laws of the city. City officials
state that the one now In force is not
even a good "chimney corner law"
and cannot bo enforced. They say
that In the future drivers will have to
comply with the very letter of the
law and that the young children of
the city will have to secure a permit
before they are permitted to drive a
car at all.
This drastic measure Is becoming
necessary from the fact that the num
ber of cars in the city Is rapidly in
creasing and that the congested down
town districts are extremely hard to
navigate even by an experienced
driver.
The city attorney will have the new
ordinance ready to present to the
iioard of City Commissioners when it
meets tonight.
Are Shipping Mules.
The second car of mules within
the past two weeks passed through
here today from west Texas to Ring
ling, consigned to K. and R. Tucker.
Tucker Bro. are of the opinion th.-,t
there will be a bis demand for farm
work stock next spring and they are
preparirg themselves to sun-ly the

PRUITT AND WALKER CASE WILL
BE HEARD BEFORE JUDGE
FREEMAN CASE WILL BE
TRIED AT THIS TERM.
The mandamus proceedings prayed
for In the criminal court of appeals by
James H. Mathers, who as attorney
for Carl Prultt and Tom Walker
sought to have Judge Freeman re
moved from sitting on the case have
been dismissed and Judge Freeman
will preside when the case comes to
trial.
The reason assigned was the fact
that tho court did not wish to estab
lish a precedent of removing district
judges at the behest of those who de
sired their removal, sometimes for
personal and not legal causes, and af
ter due consideration of tho facts by
Attorney Mathers he decided to ask
for its dismissal.
This case which Involves some
prominent citizens of tills county will
come up for trial some time during
the present session of court.
At midnight last night the Jury In
the case of the State vs. Dave Slate,
returned a verdict of guilty and as
sessed the punishment at six years
in die penitentiary.
Tli is is the case wherein the plain
tiff U said to have waylaid and .--hcrit
or.e It. R. Roland near Roundup last
June after a difficulty arising over the
possession of some farming tools. The
defendant and deceased were distant
relatives, but It Is alleged that they
have been at outs for some time.
The verdict of the jury was a sur
I prise to all attorneys who have fol
j lowed the case closely. They predict
ed that the punishment would be
much heavier than assessed by the
Jury
Today the case of the State vs.
Fate Carrutliers. charged with at

is on trial.

FAMOUS FRONTIERSMAN AND
LIFELONG REPUBLICAN SAYS
HE'S FOR WILSON; AND THAT
HUGHES WON'T DO.
Cheyenne, Wyo., Oct. 21. The
greatest rough rider of them all, "Buf
falo Bill" himself, has come out for
President Wilson's re-election. Col
onel Cody Is a great admirer of that
other eminent colonel and rough rider
but he cannot unite with Theodore
Roosevelt in endorsing Mr. Hughes.
"Buffalo Bill" had always been a
republican until a few years ago.
when he lined up with the progress
ives. How he stands this year is
shown by a characteristic telegram
sent by him from Kingston. N. C to
Frank L. Iloui. secretary of state of
Wyoming. Colonel Cody's announce
ment reads:
"Hughes c an't rld' Woodrow. He Is
pulling leather already, and will be
disqualified. BILL CODY."
Colonel Cody has never been a dem
ocrat before, but he knows a real
president.

CHAS. F. COLCORD GIVES A VERY
INTERESTING STATEMENT CON
CERNING NATIONAL POLITICS.
OIL MAN LIKES ARDMOIE.
"The clecllon November T ( rem
ises to be a Wilson victory," iid
Charles I'. Colcord last -llht :it the
Rundol hold. Mr. Colrord is tho
owner of the Colcord building 'n t.'U
liihoina City and is one of ihe larg
est oil operators anil refiners in the
state.
'.My health compelled me lo soend
the summer in the north," :,id Mr.
Colcord, "and I had plenty of time
to study-tho political h i ( u.i ' i "ii ard
took advantage of every opportunity
presented to get a line on tho senti
ment In the national election. Kwry
time I stepped Into a (rain I talked
with tho conductor. I found every
one of these men for Wilson. Pome
of them aro lifelong Republicans
but they lire for Wilson this time).
I learned further that thero ar 400,
noil of these men solidly lined up i.nd
counting their families and .hoso im
pendent upon them nnd they l.avo a
million votes for tho Democratic
nominee.
"I have not only investigated what
the probable political course that ta
bor would take but I have talked to
old men nnd young men alike In all
the walks of life. I find that they
have great confidence In the leader
ship of Wilson, they believe he will
maintain peace, they believe be sav
ed the country from financial panic
when the war began and that he will
be able to prevent another threaten
ed panic when war onds. They say
with one accord that he has accom
plished what ho set out to accom
plish, he has done these great things
with honor and without financial
loss nnd bloodshed.
"In the early summer I found some
opposition to his Mexican policy.
There were those who thought tba
Mexicans should be mado to feel the
power of our country In the line of
battle, but that was a first thought.
The second thought was the sobe"
one, the reasonable one. The people
came to realize that the Mexican
depredations were being committed
by a few outlaws and that we had
no more right to Judgo the great re
public by these men than Canada
would have a right to judge us by a
bank robber that might hold up and
rob a Canadian bank. The people I
have been among this summer say
that the president was a better Judge
of the Mexican situation than they
themselves were and they are proud
of his leadership. They express ap
preciation of the courage of the man
who can go against and win out over
what seemed at the time to be a
clamor for war.
"In addition to these people from
the common walks of life I have had
abundant opportunity to touch man
ufacturers and bankers In tho east.
I bate come in personal contact with
Boston and New Yrk bankers, I
have seen busnless men of Philadel
phia, I have seen cotton mill men of
the south and cotton goods brokers
nf New York. I was somewhat sur
prised at the attitude of these men.
I had been led by newspaper reports
to believe that big business Is for
Hughes, but I must confess I did
not find It so. Itiislness is looking
for safety and itregards Wll on as
safe. Hughes, they say, is an un
known quantity. They say 1 e has
preached from the stump what no
American can really believe In, that
the entire Democratic slato Miaul I
be wiped clean when really thcia
! hae been some very wholesome laws
passed. Hughes understands that
well as any man and he U warplns
Ms own personal views nnd slnulJ
he be elected he wsould be months In
adjusting bis acts to his own r-.al
manner of thinking. He would try
to make good on the ou'llne laid
down by his speches and that would
re-ult in an entire chance in 1-nl.
lation and the country is n t ready
for nny readjustment.
