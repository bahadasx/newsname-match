^Parkhurst & Lavender Plan for Big
Addition to Their Oarage by
Next Spring.

./
Parkhurst & Lavenler Friday
closed a deal whereby they purchased
the business lot immediately east of
their present garage of W. A. John
son of this tity, and Homer A. Mil
ler of Dos Moines. The lot is one of
the usual width—twenty-two feet,
and excellently located for the en
largement of the Parkhurst & Laven
der garage which was built three
years ago. The firm have been cramp
ed for room since the first spring af
ter opening up for business and con
template the erecting of a two story
brick addition to the present quar
ters.
The desirable building lots on east
Second street are fast disappearing
to purchasers who anticipate the
erection of brick buildings, all of
which is only indicative of the cer
tain growth of the town in a business
•way.
ARE PRACTICING
GOODJURII WEEK
Boy Scouts Led by Scoutmaster do
Lot of Helpful Things in
Community.
When you dropped your parcel the
other day was there a ooy at your
elbow already picking it up for you?
He was a scout.
When you started home with your
lieavy suitcase from the train, if you
were a woman and the time was af
ter school hours, ten to one there
was a boy scout touching his cap and
asking for the privilege of helping
you carry it.
This has been good turn week and
will be until Wednesday of next
week. Everywhere in the United
States where there is a boy scout or
der, the boys are "doing a good
turn" and making a note of it on a
little card for reporting at the next
scout meeting
Once in awhile there is a traitor
to the camp just as there is in every
church, Sunday, school, lodge or
school room, and some scout holds
up the boy scouts to the ridicule of
the ignorant, by doing some mean or
wrong thing unworthy the motto of
a scout, which is to be helpful.
But taking the scouts and aver
aging up the boys who belong to the
Webster City patrol, they more than
pasB
muster and the community is a
great deal better off with them in it.
An Appropriate Bulletin.
One of the bulletin boards in the
Kendall Young library has been
most appropriately filled in recogni
tion of Iowa Day, which occurred
Friday, Oct. 20th, and was celebrat
ed throughout the state. Postals,
pictures, and clippings relating to
grand old Iowa and her prowess, fill
the board and those who visit the
library are having their memories
jogged as to the many interesting
things about Iowa. There is a pict
ure of the Keokuk dam, the most
wonderful feat of engineering of the
times. There is a picture of a beau
tiful Swiss cottage at Burlington a
view of Clear L.ake the penitentiary
at Ft. Madison the Colfax Springs
sanitarium the Liberal Arts build
ing at Iowa City, which is one of the
if finest museums of the middle west
pictures of some of Iowa's finest
i) churches, etc. Besides these, there
Is a fine picture of the interior of
the Kendall Young library—the fln
& est Endowed library in the state.
There is a brief resume of a perti
nent Iowa article by Herbert Quick,
which appeared in a late American
magazine. A brief mention of Iowa
j- authors, etc., in short, there is a
I small encyclopedia of information
upon the bulletin board at the lib
t. rary.

(IMIIDSIIEII WELL
TRUIEDOII BORDER
Living Well and Made Physically Fit
by Experience, Says One
Who Was There.
f!
Fort Dodge, Oct. 21.—Dr. Murray
Wildman, "the only Fqrt Dodge man
to visit the guardsmen on the bor
der," reports on his return from there
that the guardsmen are getting the
best of treatment in every way. Cots
have been furnished the men. Tents
have been Adored. Mess is served at
tableB on dishes. The eatables are as
good as can be secured. Regular
hours and out of door work have
made wonderful improvement in the
physical condition o£_the men.
Dr. Wildman ate with the officers
and he ate with the men. He slept
in one of the enlisted men's tents. He
declares his experience was very en
joyable.
This is the report in general. In
detail, the doctor in an interview de
clared:
That the mess is better than one
can find in/ the average boarding
house. The mess system is on a cash
basis. The mess sergeant of each com
pany is given a cash allowance. John
Box, mess sergeant of Company F,
saved
$300
on his first month's allow­
ance. Later, when the men were get
ting everything they wanted in the
food line, he was able to save $60 a
month or more on his allowance.
The menu at noon, Sunday, Oct. 1,
Included stewed chicken, mashed po
tatoes and gravy, bread and tfream
ery butter, coffee, jam and ice cream.
The men eat heartily. Reports from
Brownsville about poor grub, Dr.
Wildman asserted, are absolutely un
founded. They probably were writ
ten^ijr men )rho get Into camp late
from town and become peevish be
cause they can not have a special
meal cooked for them.
During the Spanish-American war,
typhoid and dysentery raged in con
centration camps. Major Jepson, of
Sioux City, head of the Second Iowa's
medical branch at Brownsville, told
Dr. Wildman that the health of the
men in the camp is better than the
average in civil life. Dr. Jepson is
one of the foremost surgeons in the
state and held a chair in the medical
college of the state university for
years.
No flies and no mosquitoes are to
be found. The latrine system invent
ed by Dr. Jepson, is in use through
out the camps, as it was adopted by
the war department. All vaults have
boarded up sides, seats have lids, and
every morning the vaults are burned
out with bailed hay and crude oil.
Every drainage ditch by which the
camps are drained, where water is
standing, are sprayed with oil to pre
vent the hatching of mosquitoes.
Big incinerators of brick, contain
ing big pans in which refuse from
mess halls and kitchens are dumped,
burn up every scrap of discarded
food, and even the dishwater.
General Parker, in charge of the
division at Brownsville where 15,000
men are stationed, is winning the loy
al regard of this officers and men un
der him. He and two orderlies visit
ed every tent in the district on the
night of the big storm some time ago.
Daring the storm, the floor of Com
pany F's mess hall was the only one
not under water.
Dental Inspection.
Waterloo Courier: The Fort
Dodge public schools have taken a
great forward step by instituting
dental inspection of all pupils and
eleven dentists of the city have of
fered their services free for this pur
pose.
Medical men have discovered that
there is a very close relation be
tween the teeth and the child's men
tal and physical health. Many a case
of supposed dullness has been rem
edied by giving proper attention to
the teeth. It means more efficient
work on the part of the child to
have his teeth cared for and it Btarts
him on the road to make a better
citizen. Looking after the child's
teeth thus properly falls within the
province of the school.

DEFEATS
WEBSTER CITY
Football Teams Evenly Matched but
Local Eleven is Unable to
Tally.,
I rH'
The Humboldt high school foot
ball eleven put up an excellent exhi
bition of the national autumn pas
time on their home gridiron last Sat
urday afternoon, and carried off the
laurels of victory by the narrow
margin of one touchdown.
Webster City's youthful aggrega
tion of hopefuls displayed the best
brand of football of the season. In
fact, the outcome of the game was
in doubt until the final whistle of
the last quarter. The first half clos
ed with Webster City on Humboldt's
five yard line, where another play
would have undoubtedly swept the
ball over the chalkline for the tying
score, and the remainder of the ses
sion showed a degree of fight and
skill which more than once carried
the ball within the shadow of goal.
Humboldt's experienced back-field
proved to be the determining factor
in swinging the balance to thelir
side. At the first, receiving the ball,
the team experienced little difficulty
in carrying the ball/ for repeated
first downs, and a final smash
through Webster City's right tackle
earned the coveted score for Hum
boldt. From this time on, Webster
City seemed to gain their bearings,
and no further score came within
the range of the Humboldters.
Froning for Webster City was the
sensation of both teams. His deadly
plunging was irresistible, and" his
superb defense stood out as the
bright and shining feature of the
game. Lane at half back was also a
bulwark defensively, while Williams
at quarter displayed some pretty of
fensive work, his broken field run
ning being of a quality which prom
ises well for future games. The line
also displayed much better staying
power then in previous games this
season.
The game was remarkably clean
on both sides, despite its hard-fought
character, and the best of treatment
was accorded the visitors by their
Humboldt hosts. Frank Gotch was
among the interested crowd on the
side-lines, and his good-natured com
ments between quarters proved high
ly diverting to Coach Slfert's pro
teges.
The Webster City line-up was as
follows:
Left End—Richardson.
Left Tackle—Thompson.
Left Guard—Staley.
Center—Froning, Stafford and
Mason.
Right Guard—Leopold.
Right Tackle—Daniels.
Right End—Mason and McCon
nell.
Quarterback—Williams.

FORD DAMAGES
FRONT OF SAXON
Car Driven Without Lights Smashes
Into Auto Owned by Miss
Hazel Gruhn.
A Ford car with no lights, driven
by two young men, smashed head
on into an automobile belonging to
Miss Hazel Gruhn, the school nurse,
Saturday night and totally demol
ished the frpnt of the car, a Saxon,
beside shaking severely the occu
pants of the machine.
Miss Gruhn had driven the car up
in front of the A. E. Rasmussen
home on the south side of west Bank
street about 7:30 o'clock and had
applied the emergency brake. All
the lights of the car were on. Miss
Edwards, one of the grade teachers,
was the occupant of the back seat,
while Miss Gruhn was at the steer
ing wheel. The Ford was driven
east at a very rapid rate, say the oc
cupants of Miss Gruhn's car, and
carried no lights, when it smashed
into the Gruhn auto, driving it
backward about fifteen feet, throw
ing the driver over the steering
wheel and Miss Edwards upon the
floor in the back of the car. The
fender, lights and radiator of the
auto were practically demolished and
the two young women bruised and
shaken.
The Ford is said to have been
driven by a Mr. Turvey, a resident
of west Bank street, who stopped for
an instant, got out and started over
towards the damaged auto, but see
ing someone else approaching, turn-)
ed back and getting into his car
drove off.
Miss Gruhn's auto will be an in
valid in one of the garages for the
next several days.
Shot His Dog.
Lubbert Lubbers, who resides
seven miles northeast of the city,
was in town Saturday looking for
information. He was anxious to find
the party who drove a new Hudson
car up to his farm Friday and
stopping it, deliberately shot a fine
puppy playing about in the farm
yard. The automobile then drove on.
Mr. Lubbers is not going to rest un
til he finds out who the guilty party
or parties were and brings them to
justice. Such conduct deserves stern
dealing and would only seem to be
the act of drunken men.

ATREST ROOM
Floors and Ceilings Painted! and Hot
Water Attachment to Pipes
in Lavatoiy.
The Webster City rest room is re
celviug a few improvements this
week and already the ceilings and
floors have been painted a light grey
color. A hot water attachment will
soon be added to the pipes in the
lavatory—a great convenience for
the toilet room.
Beginning with Nov. 1st, Mrs. An
na Hebdon will act as assistant mat
ron, going on duty at 5 o'clock in
the evening and keeping the room
open until 10 o'clock at night. This
will take care of the travelers who
are waiting for the late trains and
be, so the committee in charge be
lieve, a convenience much appreciat
ed. At any rate it is worth trying
out, and a separate register will be
kept between these hours to find out
how many people make use of the
rooms evenings during a month. If
the plan proves successful, it will
be continued indefinitely if not, It
will be discontinued.
A small bank or box for free will
offerings has also been placed In the
rest room to receive the coins of
grateful travelers who are so often
surprised and glad to find a room
where they may rest.
One thing is badly needed in the
rest room, and that is several more
chairs. This is the time of house
cleaning, and no doubt in the city
there are rockers and dining room
chairs which will gladly be offered
to the room. A small table, square
or round, is also needed for the girls
who bring their lunches to the
room. There is at present only one
table In the inner room where the
lunches are eaten, and another table
is sorely needed. Anyone having
either chairs or table, is requested
to call the matron, Martin phone
4 40, and notify her. The things
will be called for later.

W. H. Cook offers bargains as fol
lows: Two used pianos at $150
each. One grafonola and seven
double face 10 inch Columbia rec
ords at $25. One fine new guitar at
a special price. The pianos have had
several years use, but are quality
makes and have been put In good
order and will save somebody $100.

CITY FEDERATION
ISJSCUSSED
Women Hold Meeting at the Library
—Plan is Favorably
Considered.
A good sized company of women
met in the club room of Kendall
Young library on Saturday after
noont at 4 o'clock to talk over the
matter of a city federation of wom
en. The plan was favorably consid
ered and will be brought up for dis
cussion at each of the city clubs this
week after which direct action will
be taken. The matter of a city fed
eration is one which will interest
every woman, whether already a
member of a club or not, for a city
federation of women Includes every
woman in the community who.
wishes to join, whether already a
member of a club or not.
The idea has been in the minds of
many women for years here, but it
remained for someone to take the
first step towards organization. A
body of women with one interest—
the helping of every good project in
the community, whether charitable,
civic or otherwise—will be a power
ful aid to any town. Mrs. F. E.
Whitley, president of the state fed
eration of clubs in Iowa, presided at
the meeting of Saturday and told of
the good done by federations in Jef
ferson, Iowa Falls, Des Moines rfnd
elsewhere.
Plans for a called meeting in the
near future were also talked over
and a chairman and secretary ap
pointed for the occasion, Mrs. Effie
Kantor having been appointed chair
man and Mrs. Murray McMurray
secretary.
