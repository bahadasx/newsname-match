Roosevelt Says Mexico Must
Be Restored to Proper
Administrators.
East Las Vegan. N- M., Oct. 24. "Real
Americanism" was the theme of CoL
Theodore Roosevelt in a 26 minute ad
drees here Monday night He criticised
president "Wilson freely and urged his
hearers to vote for Charles E. Hughes
for president.
The United States, he said, in order
to finally restore order in Mexico "must
restore our neighbor republic to its
proper governors Just as was done in
Cuba."
CoL Roosevelt declared that the Wil
son foreign policies has placed the
United States In contempt before the
world.
"Gen. Fershlng." he said, "should
have been sent after Villa with orders
to get him in spite of Carranza or any
other leader who might endeavor to
interfere."
He added that if he were callexTupon
to raise a division to go into Mexico
he would call upon citizens of New
Mexico of Mexican origin because he
had found them loyal Americans and
good fighters when they served him
with his "rough riders."
Flay Wllcon and Baker.
In his address earlier in the day at
Albuquerque. Col. Roosevelt denounced j
the reported statement of secretary of
war Baker that tne American revolu
tionists at Valley Forse were no more
than on a par with the revolutionists in
Mexico. CoL Roosevelt said secretary
Baker ought to be removed from office
for such a statement and that president
Wilson was unfit to remain as president
for allowing his secretary of war to
make such a statement without remov
ing him from office.
