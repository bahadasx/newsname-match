Thirty-eight were supplanted bj

In all construction work the fixed
policy of the Southern is to separate
important highway crossings whereover
practicable. This policj

is undertaken as a permanent Investment

The Southern has also co-operated
with local authorities in the

A. M. Latham in Home and Farm,:
Louisville. |d<
The fair season is on. This is the,B:
time of the year when we hold corn^ pi
shows, canning club exhibits and;nr
general agricultural fairs. Theibj
question may be under discussion by I Pi
many farmers now whether or not it1 Pi
will pay them to attend. Some few' fi
farmers think there is nothing to be la
gained either by showing or seeing.
This is a mistaken idea of theirs, and ni
one which they will discard fromlra
their minds if they will but stop aiw
few moments and seriously consider. Ir
It has been said that it is by corn-It1
parison that a thing is either class-'Cf
ed good or bad. Everything is corn-It11
parable in the way of nature and
man's work. Some specimens ot|e3
fruit of the same variety are better 81
than others. There are conditions *t
that cause these variations, and it is ni
worth the grower's time to study rt
I well theste differing conditions.
It is undeniably true that the pi
growers who exhibit place the best1,11
fruit they have on exhibition, which ;c#
often is not a true representation of',r
the fruit at home. These good spe- 'a
cimens go to show what can be
grown under the most favorable
conditions. If a grower has choice ?'
fruit, he is generally proud of it. The f
fair is the exhibition ground for the V1
best the country produces.
If a grower succeeds in getting a
prize because of his fruit's superior- ^
lty, he is encouraged to grow still I
better fruit and make a better showCI
ing the next year, or. if his fruit fails ^
to get awards, he is spurred on to!
t T
try to do better. This sort of good
inatured competition brings good results.
It has a tendency to induce all n
to grow better fruit. Those who fail- (''
ed will make an effor' to find out ol
why they failed and avoid making!**'
the same mistake again. and try in CI
the future to do much better. The
ideals of the fruit growing industry P
are raised, and if ov our efforts to:m
reach the Ideal, we fail to pet to thotr
poal, we are benefited as we are sure ei
to improve upon our past. P'
At even n small county fair, the *
products of the uifTerent sections are "
shown, and it is learned what varieties
do best on certain soils, un- P'
der certain situations and conditions, vi
As a consequence, the grower sees el
what is best adapted to certain sec-! ft
tions and how to improve under eer-' d<
tain conditions. it
A wonderful array of varieties willj*1
be present on the exhibition tables, j
The old standard ones, with new ones p
by their side for comparison. Tho! s;
merits of all are discussed, and often p
valuable ideas are put forth that will i tl
preatly help the small fruit grower'a
as well as the larger ones. The poor' a
varieties, or unsuitable ones, are'ai
given their show, and the grower is,
given a chance to avoid them. One p
may have intended to plant a certain n
variety, but when he sees and tastes tl
it, finds it objectionable and avoids[g
It.
The different methods of culture w
of the different kinds are discussed, al
and the most successful plans of cul- _
ture, spraying, cover crops, manur- 0]
ing, budding, thinning, etc.. can be
obtained. Then there is a great so- ^
cial advantage to be gained by these ^
meetings. The people of a class ar? tl)
brought together and often valuable h,
acq uh in tun res, that otherwise would, n(
never have existed, are made.
While there Is plenty of hard work, hi
all right in getting ready for the tt
fairs and in putting on the display,I
yet there is a lot of enjoyment and g]
fun. It relieves the monotony and' fj
revives the sleepy-spirited. It helps te
to lose some of that hated "isolation" b:
of which the farmers sometimes com- at
plain. It is educational, for?one of-;p,
ten learns how little he actually fa
knows, and is revived by being per-'d<
mitted to demonstrate the little that h<
he does know. (w
Sometimes one thinks that their si
1
products are very inferior, and they at
are inclined to want to sell out and n<
go where they can grow better stuff w

in campaign demonstrations

A throng was assembled here toght
in the square in front of the
lilroad station, where red lights
ere burned in honor of Mr. Wilson,
itroduced by Samuel Kunkel,
cuBurer or tne Democratic State
munittee, the president said: "I

is great incouragement to a public
an who is trying to do his duty to
sceive such a welcome."
The President hurried back to his
rivate car, but just as the train got
ruler way the coach ahead of his
ir jumped the track, bringing the
ain to a stop with a bump. A dey
of 15 minutes resulted.
At Greensburg the President left
is car in a driving rain and walked
ntside the station with Col. Richard
oulter. Jr., of the Tenth Pennsylmia
regiment, just returned from
le Mexican border. A band played

ppeared and the crowd applauded,
he President stood up in a flag
raped automobile, waived to the
rowd, expressed his thanks and
jen hurried back to the waiting
ain.
Brief stops were also made at a
umber of towns, whfere the presient
appeared on the rear platform
r his car and shook hands with the
sople. It rained constantly, but the
owds kept it oft' with umbrellas.
W. J. Bryan met the president at
ittsburgh and rode with him for
ore than an hour afterward on hie
ain. Because Mr. Brayan was not
cpected, he did not ride in the
resident's automobile at Pittsburgh,
rowds along the streets cheered Mr.
'ilson when he appeared.
Mr. Bryan, after talking with the
resident, said he had become conneed
that Mr. Wilson would be relected.
He has been campaigning
>r the president in the West and
eclared he expected the Democrats!

States.
"I want to put it as strongly at?
ossible that Mr. Wilson will win,"
aid Mr. Bryan. "The people ap
rove nis Mexican policy and somehing

ppeals to every class of voters." He
dded that the women of the West
