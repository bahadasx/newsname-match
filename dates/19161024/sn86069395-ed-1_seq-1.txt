Party For Business Reasons
Has Been Reduced
In Size.
At a meeting held yesterday after
noon arrangements were completed
for the booster trip today. A few cars
backed out deterred by the fear that
the roads would be muddy, but the
number definitely promised was suf
ficient for the trip to be made as
planned. Reports from the roads
were reassuring and the trip is ex
pected to be the pleasantest one yet
taken. The dust nuisance greatly in
terfered with the previous ones.
It is not planned to take as big a
crowd as on the last trip, when the
party proved unwieldly at times.
About 15 cars are counted on to go.
The following cars were definitely
promised: H. A. Keach, Morgan

Press Upholds Ordinance Re
stricting Plungers as Swed
en Already Has Done.
London, Oct. 22. The British at
tack on the Somme front resulted in
obtaining all its objectives, the war
office annoOnccs. More than 800
Germans were captured.
Twice during Sunday in the morn
ing and in the afternoon the Ger
mans launched violent attacks against
the positions newly won by the French
in the Chaulnes wood, south of the
Somme in France. Both attacks were
repulsed, the Germans suffering heavy
casualties, according to Paris. Some
of the attackers in the morning of
fensive gained a foothold in the
French first line, but were surround
ed and the 150 survivors made pris
oners. ,
Berlin in admitting that in Satur
day's fighting the British north of the
Somme, made gams, characterizes the
British attacks as "a reckless sacri
fice of human lives."
Several trenches between Biaches
and La Maisonnette, south of the
Somme, were recaptured Saturday
from tle French, says Berlin.
Notwithstanding bad weather on
the Macedonia front, slight additional
progress hss been made by the en
tente allies in the Cerna river region.
I German troops now are aiding their
i Bulgarian allies in the fighting at the
bend of the Cerna.
Heavy rainstorms and snow falls
are impeding the operations in Aus-tro-Italian
theater.
A German aeroplane which dropped
four bombs at Shecrness, England,
Sunday, is believed to have been the
same aircraft that was destroyed later
and fell into the sea under the attack
of a British naval aeroplane.
The presentation by the entente al
lies of further demands on Greece,
including the removal of Greek troops
to the southern part of the country
and tho handing over of the Greek
war supplies, is reported by Reuter's
Athens correspondent.
The German minister has presented
to the Norwegian government a note
protesting against Norway's embargo
on submarines of the belligerent
countries. The cabinet held a meet
ing and discussed the note but its
decision in the matter has not been
made public. The press unanimously
supports the government in its right
to issue such an ordinance, as Sweden
has already done.
