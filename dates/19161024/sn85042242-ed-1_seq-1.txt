Given Party
EXCELLENT REPORT FROM
NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS
Reversion in California .Excep­
tional—Montana Only Doubt­
ful Western State
A two-days swing thorugh the Red
River valley has convinced a Tribune
representative that so far as North
Dakota is concerned it naay be relied
upon November 7—"Hughesday, No­
vember 7", they write it at the Forks
—to do its duty by the entire Republic
can ticket, national, state and legis­
lative. Opinions vary as to the exact
extent of the Republican majorities
which will be polled in November.
All are agreed, however, that the
party vote will be the largest in the
history of the state.
Busy at Headquarters.
Everyone is busy at the Republican
headquarters in Fargo and Grand
Forks. Reports are being received al­
most hourly which indicate a healthy
trend toward Republicanism through­
out the state. State Chairman Lent*
ke has proven himself very much on
the Job, from the first, and the fruits
of his, labors are being revealed in
growinfcja£ntiment for the party and
its canoHates everywhere.
flnute Nelson in State.
A mafter stroke for Lemke was the
bringing here for a follow-up over Bry­
an's tracks of, SeMtorJKpute £[flto,'
of Minnesota, probably one of the
strongest mfen in the northwest. Sen­
ator Nelson entered North Dakota at
Grand Forks this morning and he will
cross thilstate on the Great Northern
speakin&'ttt all points covered by the
former Mflfetary of1 state in his re­
cent toiirP kelson, it is predicted, will
make more votes fdr his party than
any other rtiiinwhb could have been
asigned to 'tM6'territory.
From National Headquarters.
Warden Frank S. Talcott and At­
torney General Henry J. Linde return­
ed Sunday night from a several days'
visit in the east. They spent Satur­
day at the Republican national head­
quarters in Chicago, where encourag­
ing reports were being received from
all parts of the country.
"The greatest drift toward Republi­
canism is noted in California," said
Mr. Talcott, enroute home. "The
change there is really remarkable.
Montana is regarded as doubtful at
national headquarters, but the com­
mittee reports that it has a 'good t,wo
fisted fighting chance' for Kentiicky
and a number of other important bor­
der states."
700,000 Travelers for Hughes.
"Every commercial man in the
United States will vote for Hughes,"
asserted the representative of a prom­
inent New York importing house,
while on his way to Fargo on Satur­
day. "The commercial men area unit
for a Republican administration, and
they are working for the ticket every­
where. In my opinion their influence
will be an important factor. Free
trade has never helped a commercial
man. It is difficult, as every salesman
will tell you, to sell goods on a declin­
ing market, and that is what a Demo­
cratic administration puts us up
against every time."
What Will Labor Vote Do?
"I believe Wilson is over-estimating
his pull with the labor vote," chimed
in another traveler—a railway tele­
grapher from western Montana. "His
stand in the recent eight-hour case
has helped a very small percentage
of the railway laborers at the expense
of the much larger percent who were
better entitled to shorter hours and
more pay. I do not believe that Wil­
son in helping the three brotherhoods
to a bigger slice of the railway earn­
ings has gotten anywhere with the
telegraphers, the shop men, the track
men and the hundreds of poorly paid
clerks who see their chance of ever
getting a raise reduced just so much."
Incidents of he tour which have no
real bearing on the political crisis ap­
proaching its crux were a friendly
meeting between Jerry Bacon and for­
mer United States Senator Henry Clay
Hansbrough, in the lobby of the Hotel
Dakotah at Grand Forks on Sunday
afternoon, and a Fargo chat be­
tween Dave H. MacArthur, Democrat­
ic candidate for governor, and Porter
J. McCumber, nominated by the Re­
publicans for re-election to the United
States senate. Mr. Hansbrough was
in the 'Forks territory seeking to ele­
vate a Democrat to the high office in
which the votes of his Republican
friends placed the Honorable Henry
Clay. There is a serious question in
the minds of prominent Democrats as
to the value to their cause of Mr.
Hansbrough's apostasy.

in which policemen, deputy sheriffs
and bluejackets from the United

capture Paff.
Sheriff Stier, accompanied by a po­
liceman, went to Paff's shanty, locat­

an order for contempt of court. When
the officers informed Paff of the mis­
sion, he picked up a shotgun and fired
at them.

NEUTRAL COUNTRIES CAN
PREVENT* FUTURE WARS
Foreign Secretary^ Sees Little
Chance of EncHbg Conflict
London, Oct. 23.^—Another contribu­
tion to the discussion on peace was
made by Viscount Grey, secretary for
foreign affairs, at a lunch given today
1 the Foreign Press association, at
which the diplomatic representatives
of all the allied countries were pres­
ent.
The foreign secretary made it plain
that the Allies were not prepared to
discuss peace terms, and gave no indi­
cation of what their terms might be,
but welcomed any effort by neutral
countries for a combination to pre­
vent future wars. Some of the most
important passages of the secretary's
speech follow:
General Object.
The Neutrals' Task.
Passing to the question of neutral
countries, Viscount Grey said, in an­
swer to a question as to what they
could do.
"1 believe the best work neutrals
can do for the moment is to try to
prevent war like this from happening
again. If the nations had been united
in such an agreement and prompt
resolution to insist in 19i4 that the
dispute must be referred to a con­
ference or The Hague, that the Bel­
gian treaty must be observed, there
would have been no war.'V

dent on the official and popular atti­
tude in Germany toward the submar­

may also be discussed.
Rush Trial
of McDaniel
St. Joseph, Mo., Oct. 23.—Unexpect­
ed dispatch marked today's session of
the trial of Oscar O. McDaniel, prose­
cuting attorney of Buchanan county,
charged with the murder of his wife.
Before court adjourned, thirteen ve­
niremen had been selected. They will
become part of the special panel of
forty from which twelve jurors will
be chosen.
The question of John T. Barker, at
tprney general of Missouri, whose ap­
pearance today as head of the prose­
cution was a surprise for Mr. McDan­
iel, and his attorneys indicated that
the state's case against the accused
prosecutor would be of a circumstan­
tial nature. Prospective jurors were
questioned particularly as to their at­
titude toward that kind of evidence.
E
"I would like to talk, not, indeed,
about actual conditions of peace,
which can only be stated and formu­
lated by the Allies together and not
by any one of them 'separately, but
about the general Vobject which the
Allies must secure in this war. And
to do that I would jfe&you to recall

war had been forced upon Gerri\aqy,
that would be a logical statement. It

upon Germany, but was forced by Ger­
many upon Europe that it is the Al

25,000 LETTERS REACH
TOWN IN ONE DAY
.Minneapolis, Minn., Oct. 23.—Thou­
sands of letters, each containing 10
cents, are pouring into the local post
office daily from women in various
parts of the country who have joined
in an "endless chain" scheme p^lpmot
ed by the so-called National Hrokcr
age Exchange..
Federal agents are searching for
officers of the "Exchange," who are
wanted for using the mails to defraud.
A room in a local business block to
which all the letters were addressed,
was suddenly vacated three weeks
ago, the authorities say.
To every woman who would send
10 cents in silver and write five
friends urging them to join in the
chain, the "Exchange"' promised a
"new 1917 model silk petticoat."
"The volume of mail for the 'Ex­
change' is rapidly growing," said
Postmaster E. A. Purdy, "and today
we received 25,000 letters, enclosing
2i,0'00 dimes. Thousands of the let­
ters have been returned to the writ­
ers, but a large majority carried no
return mark, and as a result the dead
letter office is becoming clogged. Oth­
er mail channels of the local office are
choked daily by the influx of mail for

Attorney General Linde Files Pa­

in the Nation
JNORTH DAKOTA^JLAIMS
DAMAGE OF $1^00,000
North Dakota's claim for 11^60,000
flood damage against the State of Min­
nesota will be heprd before January
1 by the United States supreme court.
Attorney General Linde returned Sun­
day from Washington, D. C., with ad­
vice that the nation's highest tribu
hal had granted application by Mr.
Itinde as attorney for the state of
North Dakota to file a bill of com­
plaint. Every effort will be made to
expedite action in the suit, and Mr.
Linde expects to have it called before
the first of the year.
Several States Involved.
Although North Dakota's action
against Minnesota in this well known
flood damage case is an independent
one, the outcome will involve a simi­
lar claim held by South Dakota, and
important interests of the three states
are concerned. As a result of Min­
nesota's emptying drainage canals in­
to the Bois de Sioux and Mustinka
rivers, valley lands in Richland coun­
ty were flooded in 1915, and all crops
were drowned out. Twelve thousand
acres of land were covered, and the
farmers claim a total loss of fl.500,•
000. This year the floods were so se­
vere that it was impossible for the
farmers to do any planting, and there
is no means of estimating the total
loss to which they have been subject­
ed. It is said that the northeastern
corner of South Dakota has been sim­
ilarly affected, and that it has claims
equally as great.

Story of Case.
The case as outlined indicates that
the Michigan-Idaho Lumber Co. had
reason to believe it was protected in
the Northern Fire & Marine Insurance
Co., through the latter's general
agent advising the former that it was
"covered," pending the issuing of a
standard policy. There was a loss,
which was adjusted by an adjuster
representing the company, a draft was
issued to the general agent to cover
the loss, and he was later instructed
to withhold payment of the draft.
The Court's Ruling.
The supreme court rules that the
cause of action was found to be upon
the settlement and adjustment of a
fire insurance claim rather than upon

Nothing to Say.

Hughes declared he had. nothing to
say tonight concerning it.
Jeremiah A. O'Leary, in a statement
tonight, said in part, in reference to
the statement of Sunday:
"Governor Hughes has stated cor*
rectly what happened at our interview
with him. In order to prevent any
possibility of misundertsanding, "or
misrepresentation, we have carefully
reduced to writing what we wish to

we ask, 'whether, or not, Mr. Hughes
would administer the presidency ot
the United States in accordance with
