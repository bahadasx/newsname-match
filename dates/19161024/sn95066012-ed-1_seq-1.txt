TALKS TO NEW MEXICANS
Colonel Scores War Secretary for
Comparing Washington's Soldiers
to Villa's Bandits.
Albuquerque. N. M, Oct. 23. Theo
dore Roosevelt received a cordial re
ception here today. After breakfast
he was the central figure In a parade.
There was a mounted escort, includ
ing a dozen former roughtriders and
two cow girls, who presented Colonel
Roosevelt with bouquets and were
thanked and complimented.
Colonel Roosevelt spoke from a plat
form in front of a downtown hotel. He
denounced Secretary of War Baker for
Baker's comparison of Washington's
soldiers with Mexican revolutionists
and criticized the President for put
ting Secretary Baker in the cabinet in
the first place and for keeping him
there after the reported comparison.
He said Mr. Iiaker was "exquisitely"
unfit.
"This statement of Mr. Baker's, ac
quiesced in by the silence of Mr. Wil
son," said Colonel Roosevelt, "shows
Mr. Wilson in his heart believes that
Washington was not better than Villa
or Carranza; that the men of the revo
lution stood on a level with the mis
creant crew who during the last three
years and a half in Mexico have mur
dered Americans by the hundreds and
Mexicans by the tens of thousands.
"These men have perpetrated every
species of outrage upon women and
children and have turned all Mexico
into a hell of starvation. Disease and
misery; they have done this with the
active or passive assistance of the
American government under the lead
ership of Mr. Wilson and his cabinet
officer now defends them by the foul
est slander on the men who made us a
nation."
Colonel Roosevelt said the man who
professed such doctrines was wholly
unfit to stay in the cabinet and the
President who retained him was whol
ly unfit to remain President of the
United States.

GOOD ROADS COMMITTEE
Will Campaign for $15,000,000 Cali
fornia Highway &nd Issue.
A good roads committee of 100 has
been organized by the Los Angeles,
(Cal.) chamber of commerce to cam
paign actively for the $15,000,000
proyosed state issue of bonds for high
ways, to be voted on at the general
election November 7. In 1912 the
state voted $19,000,000 for trunk roads
north an south, with which 1122
miles of pved highway has been
constructed. An additional $12,000,000
is required to complete the system to
include the 2o miles originally
planned. The $1,000,000 additional,
ir the bonds are voted will bo utilized
in the construction nf new trunk lines
one of which 'will oven np miles of
hitherto Inaccessible fountain scen
ery In the Mt. Whitnej district ad
jacent to Los Angeles, nov famed for
its hunting and fishing. Interest on
the proposed issue will be pavi ,y the
counties In proportion to the work
clone therein. It is believed thw. this
provision will aid materially In car
rying the bonds. Lqs Angeles com
ty will pay more than any in the staq
but its highway system will be bene
fited in proportion.

10 TALK PEACE,
SAYSJSREY
Will Fight Until Equal Rights Are
Established for All Nations
PEACE MUST BE PERMANENT
World Must Bo Freed From the
Oppression of Prussian
Militarism.
London. Oct. 24. Another import
ant contribution to the discussions on
peace was made by Viscount Grey
secretary for foreign affairs, at a lun
cheon given yesterday by the foreign
press association, at which the diplo
matic representatives of all the allied
countries were present. The foreign
secretary made it plain that the allies
were not prepared to discuss peace
term's and gave no indication of what
their terms might be, but welcomed
any efforts by neutral countries for a
combination to prevent future wars.
Some of the most important passages
of the secretary's speech follow:
"I take it on the word of the prime
minister that we shall fight until wo
have established the supremacy and
right of free development under equal
conditions, each in accordance with
its genius, of all states, great and
small, as a fatnily of civilized man
kind. "Nations fighting for their existence
with daily increasing prospects of
seeing victory brought nearer, still
knowing that if they stop short of
victory they stop short of everything
for which they are struggling, can
not be expected to spend much time
thinking about what might happen
after victory is secured. But the neu
trals can do it. 1 observe that not
only President Wilson, but Mr.
Hughes, is supporting a league start
ed, not with the object of interfering
with the belligerents in this war, but
which will do its part in making peace
secure in the future.
The foieign secretary Insisted upon
the necessity after the war of arriv
ing at some agreement with respect
to the laws of war, arguing that the
mere indiscriminate employement of
all the resources of science Is the
prospect which threatens civilization
and the existence of the race itself.
Of the necessity "of freeing the
world from the oppression of Prus
sian militarism," he said: "We know
that, if mankind has any birthright it
is that of peace and liberty, and it is
for that we are fighting. When we
are asked how long the struggle is
to continue we can only reply that it
must continue until these things are
secured."
DUCAN FOUND NOT GUILTY
Alleged Rutland Wife Murder Acquit
ted as Insane
Rutland, Oct. 23. 'Not guilty be
reason of insanity at the time of the
act," was the verdict brought in Sat
urday in Rutland county court by the
jury, which heard the case of George
W. Uucan of this city for the murder
ot his wife by snooting at the house of
a relative on Aug. 5 last. The jurors
were out all right cu the case after

guments for t;:i ila.vs.
This verdict leaves Duean in the
custody of court, and it is up to
Judge F. M. Cutler t Bay what disposi
tion will be ma 1j of the younj man.
Attorneys J. C. Jonis und K. il.
O'Brien, tho respondent's counsel,
contend that Ducan should bo net fic
but according tj Attorney-Genenral II
G. Darber ami SUtea Attorney C. V.
Poulin, who prosecuted, the state will
fight the roloase of Due an and ask
that he be suit to the hospital for
criminal insane at Waterbury. They
claim that would be dangerous to give
him full liberty, as there might be a
return of the "impulsive insanity."
No denial of the ohojiin;; wits made
during the trial, tiie.ucfense being that
Dncan was driven insane by his wife's
conduct with one isie Fisn, who was
tornierly an Intimate friend of Ducf.n.
The respondent claimed on the witness
stand that his wife admitted relations
with Fish. Counsel declare that Ducan
is not now insane and that tho verdict
amounts to a full acquittal.

ICATION
Slavs Unable to Aid New Ally Eith
er By Rail or Water
DANUBE CROSSING THREATENED
Petrograd and Bucharest Both Admit
Armies Are Beaten and In
Retreat.
London, Oct. 23. The bridge across
the Danube at Cernavoda, the only
means of crossing the river in the
Dobrudja region, is in peril of capture
by Von.Mackensen's victorious Teuton
army, which has occupied Constanzt,
on the Itlack Sea, Rumania's most
valuable seaport.
The Important railroad running
from Constanza west to Cernavoda
has been cut at a point some miles
west of Constanza. The water route
for Russian aid to Rumania has been
closed and, according to the Merlin
olficial report, tho Teuton-llulgar
troops are approaching Cernavoda.
The Russians and Rumanians, who
have been driven from strong posi
tions, are being pursued relentlessly
oy the Germans. Turks and Bulgars.
Rumania and Russia admit that their
armies in the Dobrudja are still in re
treat. Bucharest says, "Our troops
letired immediately to the south of
the Cernavoda-Constanzt Railway,"
and Petrograd says, ' I'uder the con
tinuing pressure of the enemy our
troops and the Rumanians are retiring
offering subborn resistance at the
same time."
The Dobrudja region of Rumania
apparently Is being overrun by the
forces of the Teutonic allies. Con
stanza, Rumania's chief seaport and
fortress on the (Hack sea. already
has fallen intothc hands of the troops
ot the right wink of Field Marshal von
Mackensen's army, while the left
wing Is nearing the town of Tscher
navoda, where the Danube is spanned
by the bridge of the railroad running
from Constantza to Bucharest. Near
the center of their front, which ex
tends across Dobrudja from the sea
to the Danube, the invaders have cut
the railroad near Murfatlar and push
ed their troops "far beyond" the rail
way, line -according to Merlin.
Aside from ' the operations in Do
brudja, another British smash at the
German lines in the Somme region of
France, which netted them more
than 100(1 yards of trenches east of
Gueudecourt and Lesboeufs and car
ried their front a stop nearer the Bap-aunie-Peronne
road, is the most not
able incident of the lighting on any
cf the fronts. A gain, described by
Paris as "appreciable," Is also re
corded for the French northeast of
Morval, which lies just south of the
region where the Itrltish and Germans
were in contact.
Merlin, in touching upon the fighting
against the Uritlsh and French Sun
day between Le Sars and Rancourt,
says the attacks of tho entente allies
were sanguinarily repulsed. The
German otllcial communication ad
mits that the Germans withdrew7 Sun
day night lrom the north of Chaulnes.
south of the Somnie, to a prepared po
sition lying east of the northern part
of the Chaulnes wood.
The Russians having been cleared
from the Narayuvka river region of
Galicia, the Austro-Germans have
hurled a violent attack against other
forces of Emperor Nicholas north of
Mrody, near tho Volhynia-Gallcta bor
der. The attack was repulsed, accord
ing to Petrograd.
At the bend of the Cerna river In
Servia. Merlin says, the Germans and
Iiulgarians, fighting side by side, have
halted the offensive of the Serbs, who
are now on the defensive. Mad weath
er is still hampering full operations on
tho Macedonian front.
The Italians have again begun a
lively bombardment of Austrian posi
tions on the Carso plateau, northwest
of Trieste, probably presaging soon
another attempt to press, forward
toward Austria's chief seaport on tho
Adriatic.

MOTHER GOOSE CHARACTERS
They Will Appear in, the Annual
Hallowe'en Parade.
Listen Children: Once upon a time,
there lived In the city of Moston, so
they say, a lady with a most peculiar
name, a name such as you haven't
heard but once in all your lives, it
was Mrs. Goose. And her little Geese
of children used to climb on her knee,
and pull at her dress, and
hang around her neck, with, "Please.
Mother Goose, tell us a story." So
you see Mother Goose was a real
mother Goose, as they say. and not
just a name on the cover of a story
boe,k. Night after night Mother Goose
told her Geese of children about
"Pussy in the Well." and "The Little
Pig Who Went to Market," and
"Simple Simon," and "Mary. Mary,
Quite Contrary," "Little Jack Horner,"
"Little Mo Peep," "Cock Robin" and
all the rest of those dear people, you
and I have loved to hear about ever
since we were big enough to listen.
Now let me tell you a secret, chil
dien, a secret that we can't keep
much longer. On Hallowe'en, this
year, right here in Bennington, all the
people Mother Goose told her little
Geese of children about are going to
march down .Main street in the big
parade we all like almost the best of
anything In the whole year. Don't
you think it will be Just heaps of fun?
Think what a chance It will be to
dress up like "Little Boy Blue." "Lit
tle Miss Muifet," or any of the people
these lines tell about:
"Peter. Peter, pumpkin Kater,"
"Mary bad a little lamb," "Three men
in a tub," "Jack Jump over the candle
stick." "Old Mother Hubbard." "Bobby
Shaftoe's gone to sea." "There was an
old woman who lived in a shoe," "Jack
and Jill went up a hill." "Jack Spratt
was very fat. His wife was very lean."
"Tom he was a Piper's son," "There
was a man in our town," "Daffy-down-dilly
has come up to town," "Old King
Cole was a merry old soul and he
called for his fiddlers three.''
You know some that are better than
these. Tell Miss Yossler who you are
going to be and she will help you.

URGE VOTERS TO GO TO POLLS
Republican Committee Plans Rallies
Throughout the State.
Montpelier, Oct. 21. Chairman Wil
son of the Republican state committer
and accompanied by Horace F. Gra
ham, tho candidate for governed-, at
tended a meeting of the several town
committee's held at White River Junc
tion yesterday. The gathering was one
in which much interest was shown in
both the national and state elections.
Mr. Wilson emphasized the import
ance of arousing interest among the
voters .nd of getting out the full vote
November 7. Candidate Graham's talk
was largely on states policies and
from what he said, he will, as gover
nor, place a restraining hand on un
necessary expenditures.
The Republican state committee is
outlining a somewhat vigorous cam
paign for the two weeks preceding
election day. The question lias been
frequently asked since headquarters
were opened here, "why a campaign
with no contests for state offices and
why should Vermont wage a campaign
for the national ticket with the state
safely Republican? The question at
first may seem reasonable, but upon
second thought, does not seem to stand
rigid analysis. Vermont has a reputa
tion that has been- maintained for
year?. Her solid or practically solid.
Republican vote has actracted the at
tention of the people the country over.
If in the former September stale
elections a majority of thirty odd
thousand way given the state ticket,
It was set down as shoeing how the
election would go for the national
ticket the next November.
The purpose of the campaign is
therefore evident. The state commit
tee desires one' of these old-time ma
jorities in November the same, indi
eatit.n of loyalty to Republican policies
and to the candidates for president
and vice-president as has so many
times been made by the voters of the
state.
With a national ticket that is a de
light to all true Republicans and with
a statrf ticket composed of men whose
ability has already been shown in of
fices of trust, every voter should show
his loyalty to party and his apprecia
tion of the candidates by going to the
polls November 7.
Benjamin Gates, candidate for slate
auditor, will pass the next two weeks
at. Republican headquarters in charge
of the speaking schedule. It is plan
ned to have as many rallies in the sev
oral ccunties as there are avuilable!
speakers, and the indications are that i
the people are taking an interest and
desire to hear the "spoken word" ns
much in this campaign as in any in
the past. Rallies may be arranged
through the town committees who
will complete the final arrangements
wilh the stale committee.
Thousands of lithograph likencssc
of Presidential Candidate Iloughcsj
have been sent to every section of the
state and much literature of a nation
al Character has been forwarded to
the town committees for distribution.
From now till election day the state
committee will be busy and It Is the
earnest hope that the voters will rally
to the polls and pile up one of those
old-time, stimulating and Invigorating
majorities for both the national and '
the ticket.
