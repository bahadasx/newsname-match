HUGHES MEN QUICK TO BET
NEW YORK, Oct 24. When Wilson money dropped
into Wall Street and waa offered to back the President for
re-election against an equal amount of Hughes money, it
was bo quickly taken on the curb that B. Bunge's repre
sentative, who held the $1,000 offered," almost 'had his
Jjreath taken away.
Despite thiB one and several smaller even beta reported
on tho stock exchange, the odds continuo at 10 to 9 on
Hughes to defeat Wilson, and there is plenty of Hughes
money offering.
Yesterday was the largest single day in the election
betting in the street; during this campaign. It was esti
mated that about $75,000 was placed at the prevailing
odds of 10 to 9. Tho betting opened with odds at 10 to 8,
gradually increasing as more Wilson money came fprward.

The Roumanians lost their largest

of grain and kerosene. At the same time
they lost their main communication with

One, or the strongest arguments yet
presented In ravor or an nil-year hair
holiday ror Government workers In'
Washington Is contained In an opinion
by Col. W. A. Ucthcl, acting Judge
advocate general or the army, to Sec
retary or War Baker today.
Colonel Bethel's recommendation ror
extension or the holiday takes the form
of a legal opinion In which It Is held
the law clearly makes Saturday a half
holiday In tho District of Columbia,
and that the clerks are legally entitled
to tho holiday for the entire vmr tut
well as during tho three months' sum
mer penou.
ine opinion cans attention to an
earlier opinion of the Judge advocate
general dated July 11, 1308, In which It
wan held:
"Every Saturday from 12 o'clock
noon becomes a legal holldav In the
District of Columbia for all purposes to
tha same extent that Sundays, Christ
mas, rounn oi juiy, midot, ana Dec
oration Days are legal Holidays."
Conclusion of Opinion.
In summing up his conclusion the act
ing Judge advocate general of tho army
said: ,
"It will nppear from what has been
said that each Saturday afternoon Is
a legal holiday in the District of Co
lumbia for all purposes, and that the
practice or the several executive de
partments or working their employes
to 1 o'clock during tbo summer
months and to 4:30 during the re
mainder or the year rests on tho dis
cretion or the heads or the depart
ments to require work on holidays
where the needs or the Jubllc service
requlro the same.
Have Legal Authority.
"It Is clear that under the law as
It stands the heads or the departments
may legally close their respective de
partments at 12 o'clock noon on each
Saturday throughout the year. As
Congress has mado Saturday after
noon a legal holiday for all purposes
In the District of Columbia whero the
executive departments are located, It
may be assumed that Congress, In the
light or prior legislation respecting
the hours or labor or the executive
departments, contemplated the clos
ing or the departments on Saturday
afternoon.
"For this reason, as well as for the
reason that I think the public service
would not be Impaired by such action,
I recommend action In line with that
suggested by Mr. Gompers."

Charles E. Hughes, when he speaks In
Queens borough tonight, Is expected to
havo somothlng to sa about the hyphen
charge. The candidate waa silent to
day, but those close to him suggested
he may reply to tho Democratic claims.
Tho Domocratlc national committee
continued Its hyphen drive against him
today. Their latest Instalment In the
scries concerning tho admitted confer
ence between Hughes and tho American
Independence Conferonco linked the
name or Supremo Court Justice Co
halan, or this city, as with the hyphen
organization.
It named him as a speaker to the
"conferees,'' and claimed he had urged
getting In touch with Republican leaders
more closely.
The Democratic contention la that
Hughes uttered anti-ally attacks sub
sequent to his conference with the In
dependence group. At one point, the
Democratic document snys his attack
on Wilson's "surrender to force" In tho
eight-hour law was regarded as strong,
but not whdlly satisfactory.
Denial by Willcox.
In denial of the charges, Chairman
Willcox, of the Republican national
committee, reiterated his statement that
HUghes had mado the organization no
pledges, had entered Into no agree
ments nor deal.
Willcox charged that the Democrats
were peeking hyphen favor. The Hughes
talk with the Independence organization
and the American rights committee was
ut tho solicitation of the organization,
ha said, while he claimed tho Demo
crats had sought council with hyphens.
The Republican chairman chanted the
Democrat1 iia-i frutikd out a speech,
translated Into German, as made- by
Congressman Lleb of Indiana.
Henry Welsmann, head of the
German-American Alliance, who has
denounced President Wilson on
several occasions, was asked by
tho Wilson campaign managers to
meet Senator W. J. Stone for an "In
formal talk'' when the Senator mad
his memorablo visit here last September
to meet the Rldders and other promi
nent Germans In tho Interest of Mr.
Wilson. This was Wlllcox's chanre
against the Democrats today.
Information regarding the Welsmann
invitation, backed by n facsimile of the
letter Bent to Mr. Welsmann on the sta
tionery of tho Democratic national com
mittee, was given out by Chairman
Willcox of the Republican national com
mittee. Soliciting Themselves.
"Tho absurd and dlslngcnnous phase
of the whole matter," said Mr1. Willcox
In making public the letter, "Is that
while Mr. Wilson's managers havo
charged speclnlly on two separate occa
sions that Mr. Hughes was compounding
with a certain branch of the electorate
they themselves were covertly soliciting.
In a most abject way, the support of
members of tho German-American Al
liance." Tle letter to Mr. Welsmann follows:

Further Increases May Come If
Cost of Materials Is Not Low
ered Soon.
Officials of Prince George's county, Md today are facing
one of the deepest mysteries in the hiBtory of the State' as a
result of the finding of the charred bones of a man, and a hat
and penknife, scattered on a pile of burnt brush in a field at
Forrestville.
The knife was identified aB the property of Frank Poschl,
a German, fifty-five years old, who disappeared on August 20
from his farm, about a mile from the scene where the bones
were found.
At a coroner's inquest at Forrestville yesterday afternoon
by Justice of the Peace W. E. Cox, the jury decided that the
bones were those of Poschl, and that he came to his death "by
meanB unknown to them."
Sheriff Gates and State's Attorney Marvin S. Peach
today will begin the investigation where the coroner's jury left
off, with practically no apparent motive for any one to take
the man's life.
Although Dr. John Stansbury testified at the inquest yes
terday that Poschl had suffered from spells of despondency
some time ago, officials dismiss the theory of suicide.
SCOFF AT SUICIDE THEORY.
They hold that it would have been practically impossible for
Poschl to pile up the brush, sit it afire, and then throw himself
across it to burn to death.
Poschl was not a wealthy man, so far as .the authorities
have been able to learn. He owned the eight-acre farm on
which he lived with his sister, Mrs. Josephine' Soriimer, her
husband, William, and their children. He left about $50 in
cash, but no will that Sheriff Gates has been able to find.
According to the information obtained by Sheriff Gates
in his investigation, Poschl left the little one-story frame house
on his farnvon August 20, saying that he was going to visit
another sister, Mrs. Anna Gibbes, who lives at Meadows, Md.,
three miles away.
It was two weeks later, according to Sheriff Gates, when
Frank Sommer, the dead man's nephew, met his aunt, Mrs.
Gibbes at church in Forrestville and asked how his" uncle was.
HADN'T BEEN AT HER HOUSE.
Mrs. Gibbes was surprised by tho
question, and, according to the sheriff,
told young Sommer that Poschl had
not been to her heuse at all. It was
then that Sheriff Gates first learned of
the man's disappearance. He said Mrs.
Gibbes notified him.

10 POTOMAC PARK A STRENUOUS DAY
A general increase in the price of
bread in Washington is to be ex-.
pected within a few days.
Already the Corby Baking Com
pany, one of the largest baking es
tablishments in the city, has an
nounced a 1-cent-a-loaf increase, to
become, effective on and after
Thursday.
- In an advertisement appearing in
today's issue of The Washington
Times, the company states in an
open communication to its patrons:
"Wo respectfully announce
.that on and after Thursday,
October 26, 1916, our breads
that have been retailing at five
cents per loaf will hereafter re
taif at six cents.
"Rolls which have been retail
ing at ten cents per dozen, will
hereafter retail at twelve cents
per dozen."
Other bakers, it is expected, will
follow with similar increases, al
though it is stated that no agree
ment to this effect' exists.
It is explained that since 1914
there has been a 70 per cent in
crease in the cost of all materials
entering into the manufacture and
distribution of bread.
MORE INCREASES.
The Increase of 1 cent a loaf on
bread and 2 cents a dozen on rolls. It
Is understood, will not do more than
take up 20 per cent of this 70 per
cent Increase In cost of materials. For
this reason It is predicted that If the
price of raw materials 'continues to
go up, further Increases In the price
of bread not only here, but tnrough
out the country are bound to come.
Bakers declare that the only alter
native Is to cheapen the quality of
the product, a thing which well-established
concerns are unwilling to do.
During the last two years, It Is
stated, the bakers here nnd elsewhere
have managed by the strictest kind
of economies and by operating at a
loss, to keep the retail price of their
product down, but with no let up In
sight on the cost of raw materials it
Is Impossible, It is stated, for them
to continue to bear the strain.
Price Up Elsewhere.
In Now York. Baltimore, and other
large cities or the country tho price of
bread has already gone up anywhere
from 1 to 2 cents a loaf.
Many of the larger baking establish
ments mako and repair their own de
livery wagons and evcn shoo their 6vn
horses, and consequently have been
made to feel not only tho Increase In
tho prlco'of nour, lard, and other bread
Ingredients, but likewise In the prlco of
wagon material, horseshoes, and nails.
