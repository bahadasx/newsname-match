COLUMBIA, MISSOURI, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1916
IS
E
So Says Mrs. Deborah Knox,
W. C. T. U. Lecturer, in
Speech Here.
SALOONS EXPENSIVE
For Every Dollar of Revenue
They Bring, It Cost $1.37,
She Says.
"Outside of the European war which
is at present raging across the waters,
the two greatest questions before the
world and the American people today
are the constitutional amendment for
national prohibition and the obtain
ence of national franchise for women,"
said Mrs. Deborah Knox Livingston
In her talk at the Hyppodrome last
night. Mrs. Knox is a W. C. T. U.
lecturer.
By quoting statistics and testi
monials from persons of national
reputation and by pointing out the
evil effects of liquor on the human
system, Mrs. Livingston vividly in
dicated the trend of public opinion
in favor of prohibition.
In making a comparison of the
number of children found in schools
in dry and wet cities of equal size in
Nebraska, the speaker said that educa
tional facilities were extended to an
amazingly larger number of children
in dry cities than in those which had
saloons. "What was true of cities in
Nebraska was also true of states as a
whole," said Mrs. Livingston, "as a
review of the records of Massachusetts
and Kansas set forth."
Tells of Indnstrial Life.
"In investigating the child labor
situation," continued the Rhode Is
land Suffragist, "I found there was a
close relation between solving child
industrial life and solving the drink
problem. Eighty-seven per cent of
the appeals made In this country for
public charity are traceable to the
drink evil."
Mre. Livingston said that according
to avowedly reliable records examined
by her, ninety-two out of every one
hundred men and women incarcerated
in our great state and federal penal
institutions are there because of
drink." In referring to the economic
side of the drink question in its re
lation to state institutions, the speaker
quoted the following declaration re
cently made to her by a member of
the Rhode Island Board of Control:
"For every dollar we receive from the
liquor traffic of the state of Rhode
Island it costs us $1.37 to take care
of the products of the saloon."
Mrs. Livingston recited the conver
sation of a recent interview with an
influential brewery representative,
who, in answer to Mrs. Livingston's
questions as to why the liquor in
terests were losing ground and why
he thought a prohibitive constitu
tional amendment would soon pass,
made the statement that the causes
for it were numerous but the main
ones were the new efficiency basis of
big business and the ballot in the
hands of women. "When you get the
American business man to see the re
lation of bigger and better business to
the dollar sign, we will have na
tional prohibition," the speaker as
serted. "Since suffrage has come to be rec
ognized as a political and not wholly
a religious movement to be carried on
through the pupits, the right of fran
chise must be given to women in a
political way even though five out of
every seven members of the churches
are women," said Mrs. Livingston.
HER SON BURNED TO DEATH
Mrs. George F. Davis, M. U. Student,
Called Home Husband Drowned.
Mrs. George Fleming Davis, a stu
dent in the School of Education, left
last night for her home at Defiance,
Mo., where her son, George Fleming
Davis, was burned to death yesterday
while playing with matches which set
afire a barn belonging to his grand
father. The boy was the posthumous
son of George Fleming Davis, United
States consul to Cieba, Honduras, who
was drowned there shortly after his
appointment In 1911.
Dogs of War Attack K9.
A large shepherd dog rode down
Ninth street this morning comfortably
sheltered from the rain on the fender
of an automobile. Seven of his less
fortunate brethren, the rabble of the
street, formed a mob and made an at
tack. After a brief struggle the pluto
crat was grabbed roughly by the neck
and pulled down into the street upon
his back, only to be rescued by his
owner.
