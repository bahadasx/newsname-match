UNTIL Friday at lea.st jitneys will
fe permitted to run loose on
the crects of Tulsa carrying uh
many passengers ub their backs will
hold.
Yesterday members of
union went into superior
the jitney
court and
injunction
obtained u temporary
m-ninHt the citv com miHsloners which
prohibits them or their agents from
enforcing the new jitney ordinance.
The hearing to decide whether the
Injunction shall be mada permanent
is set for Friday, October if 7, before
Judge Breckinridge.
The injunction was obtained
shortly before 12 o'clock yesterday
morning. Less tlian half an hour
later many of the jitneys had re
sumed operations on the routes
which were forsaken last Wednes
day night. All of the cars were, run
ning again by hist night.
Tlie application for an injunction
was filed in the name of G. W.
Dickons, a Jitney driver, and was
brought against the board of com
missioners of the city of Tulsa. A
cash bond of $150 was filed by the
plaintiff.
Meant to Quit I'nion.
Several of the jitney owners were
preparing to iult the union and op
erate Independently before the in
junction action was taken in court.
Three have ulready taken out li
censes under the new ordinance and
will operate regardless ol the out
come o the hearing next Friday.
The new ordinance, which Is so
strenuously objected to by the J it -neurs,
limits the number of passen
gers cHrried in a jitney to two more i
than the registered capacity of the
car. The owners claim they can not
operate at a profit under such re
strictions. Many of the jitney drivers com
plained last night that their business
yesterday was not tip to the average
of what it was before they sus
pended. On the other hand, street
cars continued to haul largo crowds
during the rush hours.
The jitney problem probably will
not be taken up at the city commis
sion meeting- today. Last Friday the
jitneurs asked the commission to
amend the new ordinance so that the
capacity limit would be mado four
Instead of two In excess of the reg
istered capacity. Further action will
likely lie postponed until after tho
Injunction proceedings. Three of the
commissioners are known to oppose
any chance In the ordinance.
H. H. ROGERS IS AN

ARMY H. Rogers Is an active
candidate lor state representa
tive on the Rcpublhan ticket In Tulsa
county and reports to the contrarj
are absolutely without fundatlon.
For political purposes rumojg havw
been freely circulated to the effect
that Mr. lionets was forced Into tho
race against his will, that ho is not
making a campaign and that he will
not serve if elected. The World is
Authorized to state that these rumor
are absolutely groundless.
Mr. Rogers, like his running mate.
Cilenn Condon, was drafted as a can
didate by a number of his friends
here, but. after receiving the nomina
tion he made tin his mind to mako
tho race, believing that not to do so
would be shirking his duly.
Is .Siiixvssriil M ill.
Mr. 1 toners Is one of the brainiest
men in Oklahoma, lie has made a
irrrat success of hia own business af

now connected with the Mo-Man Oil
company and is Httorney for the snmo
organization, tie is inornupniy convn
tmnt with the needs of the oil In
dustry and is remarkably wel) ac
quainted with governmental affairs In
this state. If cle led he will un
doubtedly be one of the shining Hants
of the house of representative and
with the assistance of Mr. Condon will
be able to do Tulsa county a vast
amount of good.
Pressing business affairs have nrido
it impossible for htm to wage a very
extended campaign but he is going to
devote as much of his lime as posslblr
to politics for the next two weeks.
Anyone who knows hliu or knows of
his career recognize in him tho most
able man ever presented by any party
to the voters of Tulsa county for sucb
a position and no man will make a
mistake in supporting him In the com

With Condon nnd Rogers In the

Oct. 23. Cor
nered in a canyon known as the
Charlie creek canyon, ten miles south
east from the town of Kaw City, the
men who last Wednesday night held
up Santa IV train No. 405 near the
town of Mliss and killed .Mail Clerk
I'crcy A. Norman and escaped through
the network of olficers surrounding
them, arc again in the wilds of the
OhHge country. In leaving the men
deserted all of their belongings, in
cluding tlielr horses, camping outfits,
beds and blankets and a several days'
supply of food. They apparently had
made their escape out of the canyon
through the upper end, which was
only lightly guarded until the arrival
of adilitional lorces lrom Kaw City
and Piiwhuska, and had slipped by
by stealing on foot up one of the
tributaries to the big canyon.
Officers from tho several counties
surrounding the community nml spe
cial agents of the railroad and ex
press company and the Fnltod States
government, assisted by a number of
cowboys and others from the Osage
country, were covering overy mile of
that part of the Osage, expecting to
come upon them at any time. It will
bo extremely difficult for the men to
make a getuway now out of the
Osage, unless they are able to steal
some horses from some of the cow
camps in tho neighborhood.
la tho remains of their camp wnicn
was deserted by the bandits were a
number of packages f crackers and
tins of meat and sardines.
Identify Packages.
The packages bore some marks by
which they could ho identified and the
officers were working in ull towns in
that part of the county to learn where
they had been purchased and by
whom.
Further positive identification of
tho horses found whre they had been
deserted by the outlaws was made by
nion who Baw them near a 101 ranch
tho afternoon of the robbery and by
the peculiar marks made by the shoes
of two of the animals. Recent de
velopments and the big rewards that
are being offered for the arrest of the
train robbers huve aroused the whole
country and many men are Joining
the posses hourly in hope of getting
in on a putt of the reward when the
men are cupturod, and this is believed
by the cowboys and residents of the
Osuge to be merely a matter of hours
or possibly a day or two.

ordered the railroads to give tlio
Tulsa Cold Storage company stor
age-in-transit privileges. Thero
are four railroads In Tulsa, the
Santa Fe, Frisco, M., K, T. and
the Midland Valley. Tho new
rate applies owr the south,
southeast, east and north. Fruit
stored here can bo used to com

and St. I.ouis markets if desire
PRoliAULY tho biggest Industry
ever located In Tulsa, both In the
amount of money invested and the ul
timate results to the city at large, has
opened for business. It is the Tulsa
Cold Storage company, a reorganiza
tion of tile Tulsn Packing company,
the charter of which concern was
uncoiled by the secretary of state last
Saturday at Oklahoma City and tho
capital stock increased from $50,000
to 1250.0110.
Paul M. Oallawuy. for ten years
manager or tnc electric light and ice
plant here, owned by the Public Serv-
coinpnny of Oklahoma, Is presi
dent and general manuger of the cor
poration. II. P. Anderson, prominent
oil man. Is vice-president anil treas
urer of the concern. Robert L. Cham
bers of San Francisco, formerly in the
hanking business on the coast, is sec
retary, and William II. Voelker, for
many years manager of Armour &
, s largest storage plants, is man
ager.
The plant on the banks of the Ar
kansas river, ut the east entrance cif
the new $200,000 county bridge, is
practically completed. Tho first car
load of apples lor storage here ar
rived yesterday from the state of
Washington. Fn't and vegetables
from cvciy section of the I'nited States
will be storco here In the future. Scv-
il hundred carloads of such prod
ucts can be stored In the plant at one
tune and the mechanical equipment
and construction are such that even
if tho machinery should tie shut down '
for a week the temperature ill the I
stoiagc rooms would not change one
degreo.
The plant Is absolutely the latest
thing in cold storages and has at
tracted attention throughout the coun
try. It Is complete to tho minutest
detail.
The building Is situated on the com
pany's property of II acres. It Is
Mreproof, being built of brick and re
inforced concrete. The roof also Is
of concrete, which Is something new.
The building is so completely Immune
from fire Hint the owners Hill carry
no fire insurance on their investment.
All who store will have an exceed
ingly low Insurance rate, not In ex
cess of 25 cents per $100. It will
likely be unlet- 25 cents.
Five Floors.
The storage lias five floors with a
total capacity In excess of one mil
lion cubic feet. All the floors are
equipped with double walls with
gioiiud cork Insulation on tho Inside
wall. All floors and pillars are solid
concrete. No expense was spared for
material and only the best obtainable
was used. One of tlio newest wrinkles
In cobt storages will be In tho Inside
vestibules. These vestibules will tio
built inside the plant at each door, so
that stock taken from tho coolers can
bo placed In these vestibules until
hauled away, Instead of being put on
Hie outside, exposed to tlio weather.
A low leitipei atui e will lie maintained
in these vestibules.
Olio of the rooms will lie used for
storing lee. This room has a capacity
for five thousand Ions, Facilities aru
being completed t) leu urouiid ton
cars ut one time,
Track Facilities.
The new plant has excellent track
facilities, being located on the main
line of the Frisco. Tho plant has
ample trackage to handle several ears
at u time. A solid concrete plat form
surrounds tho building on tlio track
side. All trucks used will bu rubber
tired, so as to handle fruit as lightly
as possible to prevent bruising. The
building is so erected that two addi
tional floors can be added if required.
A poultry, feeding and freezing plant
will be installed later. The company
states this will be conducted by other
parties as It Is ii) the cold storage
business only.

ALLIES DO NOT
CONSIDER PEACE
Viscount (Irev of Filmland
Says Entente Won't
Talk Terms Vet.
WHO STARTED IT?
What Nations Must Do Ts
to Prepare to Prevent
Future War.
LONDON, o. t. i'3 ,,. m.)
Another Important contribution
to the disc ussions on peace was made
by Viscount tlrey, secretary for for
eign affairs, at a luncheon given to
day by the Foreign Pi ess association,
at wbiab the diplomatic representa
tives of nil the allied countries were
present.
The foreign secretary made It plain
that the allies were not prepared to
discuss peace terms and gave no indi
cation of what their terms might be.
but welcomed any efforts by neutral
countries tor a combination to prevent
luliire wars. Some of the most Im
portant passages of the secretary's
speech follow:
How Mid II lllipisn?
"I would like to talk, not, indeed,
about actual conditions of pence,
which can only be stated and formu
lated by the allies together, and not
by any one of them separately, but
about the general objects which the
allies must secure in tills war. And
to do that I would usk you to recall
that we must never forget how the
war came about. If we are to ap
proach peace In a proper spirit it can
only bo by recollecting nnd recalling
and never for a moment forgetting
what was fbu real cause of the war.
"I believe the best work neutrals
can do for tho moment Is to try to
prevent a war like this from happen
ing again. If the nations had been
united 111 such an agreement and
prompt resolution to insist In 1914
that tlio dispute must be referred to
a conference or The Hague, that the
Mnlglan treaty must be observed,
there would have been no war."
