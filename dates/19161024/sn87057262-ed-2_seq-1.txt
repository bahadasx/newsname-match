DENVER, Oolo., Oct. 24.—/This was
booked as the busiest of all the busy
days Colonel Roosevelt has had since
he started on hie 6,300 mile Jaunt
through the southwest and middle
west In the Interests of Republican
Candidate Hughes. He arrived here
shortly after ten o'clock, got a "stren
UOUB" welcome, was paraded through
the main streets to the'Brown Palace
hotel, attended a luncheon, had an
auto tour among the nearby hills and
spoke at a woman's meeting this aft:
eraoon at the auditorium. This even
ing he is to lead another parade at
tend a dinner tendered him the
Hughes' women's special and address
another audience at the auditorium.
Colonel Roosevelt today, for the
first time, expressed himself regard
ing the incident at Chicago when a
woman's demonstration during the
president's visit there was broken.
He took this incident as one of the
subjects in his speech ibis afternoon..
The speech was extemporaneous.
The oolonel believes his meeting to
day with the members of the women's
•Hughes campaigners particularly pro
pitious, for defending the women
again the "silk stocking" charges
made against them.
Roosevelt had an extra speech
wrung from him yesterday by the
local committee at LasVegas, N. M.,
where the population is sixty per
cent Mexican. He pleaded for straight
Americanism regardless of anteced
ents, and said if war with 'Mexico
does come and he is permitted to
raise a 'brigade, the first people he
will appeal to will be the American
Mexicans of New Mexico.
The Albuquerque stop yesterday
cost the colonel five cents more than
he had anticipated.
Tw£ busy movie men w.ho had hired
cowboys and cowgirls, anil had
bought flags for the school children
to add a touch of color to the parade,
asked the colonel to pose with an
Indiiai) woman who makes her living
by letting tourists take her picture.
They had promised her a quarter. She
thought she was to get the money
from noosevelt and when the movie
men began grinding without any
money having been given her, she
yelled at the colonel "twenty-five
cents or no picture."
Roosevelt pulled a nickel, all the
change he had, from his pocket and
gave It to her. She pocketed the
nickel, but refused to go on unless
she got the union wage. The picture
was taken as the colonel was handing
her the coin.
Colonel Roosevelt surprised the
local republican committee here to
day by declaring he is supporting

TO THAT HYPHEN CHARGE
were seeking hyphen favor. The
Hughes talk wltji the independence
organization and the American rights
committee was at the solicitation of
the organization, he said, while he
claimed the democrats had sought
council with hyphens.
The republican chairman charged
the democrats had franked out a
speech translated into German, as
made by Representative Lieb of In
diana.
The democratic contention is that
Hughes uttered anti-ally attacks sub
sequent to his conference with the
independence group. At one point,
the democratic document says his at
tack on Wilson's "surrender to force"
in the eight hour law was regarded
as strong, out not wholly satlsfac

A

ment was a letter to the clergy in
which the American Independence
conference invited "dear reverend
father" to attend their session at Mil
waukee, Oct. £6, and offered to pay
the clerical expenses.
While the hyphen controversy
raged, betting here stiffened. Some

prevailing odds early were ten io

Seventy-five thousand dollars was
the bet made yesterday, the biggest
