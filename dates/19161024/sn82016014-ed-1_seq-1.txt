General Rumor De Factos Will
Evacuate if Attacked.
Kl Taso. Tex.. Oct. 24. Hundreds of
refugees fleeing from Chihuahua City
streamed into Juarez during the night
and early today bringing confirmation
of the reports of Villa's presence out
side Chihuahua City. These refugees
declare that the Villistas are on the
western side of the city and an attack
on the northern Mexico capital is ex
pected at any moment.
About midnight 300 residents of
Chihuahua City arrived in Juarez.
Another train brought the family of
General Trevino, Carranzista com
mander. In one car were thirty girls,
.laughters of the most prominent fam
ilies in the capital. Many of the refu
gees crossed to the American side of
the border.
Nearly all these refugees had left
because they feared Villa would again
enter Chihuahua City and some of
them believed Trevino will evacuate
with his forces' when the assault be
gins. Tne situation is believed serious
because Trevino's family had returned
to Chihuahua City only a week ago.

The refugees also brought con

f: inn the American Fifth cavalry was

dred beeves were killed on the ranch
by Villa's men, it is said.

Appeals to American-Mexicans

Denver, Col.. Oct. 24. This was
booked as the busiest of all the busy
days Colonel Roosevelt has had since
he started on his 6,300 mile jaunt thru
the southwest and middle west in ..he
Interests of Republican Candidate
Hughes.
He arrived here shortly after 10
o'clock, got a "strenuous" welcome,
was paraded thru the main streets to
the Brown Palace hotel, attended a
luncheon, had un automobile tour
among the nearby hills and spoke at
a women's meeting this afternoon at
the auditorium. This evening he is
to lead another parade; attei d a din
ner tendered him by the Hughes Wo
men's Special and address another au
dience at the auditorium.
Roosevelt today for the first time
expressed himself regarding the inci
dent at Chicago when a woman's dem
onstration during the president's visit
there was broken up. He took this
incident as one of the subjects in his
speech this afternoon. The speech
was extemporaneous. The colonel be
lieves his meeting today with the
members of the women's Hughes cam
paigners particularly propitious for
defending the women against the "silk
fctockirig" charges.
Extra Stop at I. as Vegas.
Roosevelt had an extra speech
vi rung from him yesterday by the lo
cai committee at Las Vegas, N. M..
when the population is 30 per c?nt
American. He pleaded for straight
Americanism regardless of antece
dents and said if war with Mexico does
coine and he is permitted to raise a
brigade, the first people he will ap
peal to will be the American-Mexicans
of New Mexico.
The Albuquerque stop yesterday
cost the colonel 5 cents more than he
had anticipated. Two busy movie
men who had hired cowboys and cow
girls, and had bought flags for the
school children to add a touch of color
to the parade, asked the colonel to
pose with an Indian woman who
makes her living by letting, tourists
take her picture. They had promised
her a. quarter. She thought she was
to get the money from Roosevelt and
when the movie men began grinding
without any money having been given
her, she yelled at the colonel, "Twenty-five
cents or no picture."
Roosevelt pulled a nickel, all the
change he had, from his pocket and
give it to her. She pocketed the
nickel but refused to go on unless she
got the union wage. The picture was
taken as the colonel was handing her
the coin.
BIGGEST CAMPAIGN STUNT.
Monster Celebration Planned When
Colonel Roosevelt lilts Chicago.
Chicago, Oct. 24. Colonel Roose
velt's appearance in Chicago Thursday
will be one of the most stirring and
most spectacular events of the national
campaign, if plans are carried to a
finish. Plans are being prepared to
make his reception equally as enthusi
astic as was the greeting accorded
President Wilson last Thursday.
Red fire, brass bands and noise will
rule the day. Two meetings will be
held, at which the Oyster Bay man will
speak, one attended by women, and
the other at the stock yards amphithe
ater. President Wilson spoke to simi
lar meetings in both halls.
An escort of cowboys will conduct
the colonel from his hotel to the
stock yards pavilion.
The Republican leaders expect the
colonel to go far toward persuading
the recalcitrant Progressives to get
into line for Mr. Hughes and they
hope, too, that he will be able to stem
the tide of women voters toward Mr.
Wilson.
Denials were forthcoming at the
Republican western headquarters that
the prospective speech of the colonel
in Chicago is being subjected to a
blue pencil, or that the stipulation has
been made that he shall not refer to
the Germans in the manner that he
did in his "skin 'em alive" speech at
Battle Creek.
Making claims that Hughes will
sweep Ohio, Indiana and Illinois by
from 100.000 to 200,000, the Republi
can managers started on the last lap
of the contest with the hope of rolling
hack the Wilson wave sweeping over
the western country.

Wealthy Missouri Farmer
Maintains Son's Innocence.
Accused Prosecutor-Candidate
Gives Up Campaigning.
St. Joseph, Mo.. Oct. 24. When se
lection of jurors for the McDaniel
murder case was resumed today, it
was apparent from the examination of
talesmen by Attorney General Barker
that thestate intends to ask the death
penalty for the county prosecutor.
The state expects to complete the se
lection of a jury by Wednesday or
Thursday and begin the presentation
of evidence then, so that McDaniel
may have a verdict before election
day. The accused prosecutor contin
ues his campaign for re-election.
The special venire from which the
Jury will be chosen for the trial of Os
car D. McDaniel, prosecuting attorney
of Buchanan county, who is charged
with the murder of his wife, was more
than haif completed here this after
noon, with twenty-three of the neces
sary forty accepted. Attorneys pre
dicted that the venire would be com
pleted today and that the peremptory
challenges of the state and defense,
reducing the venire to the twelve men
of the trial jury, would be heard to
morrow. McDanlel's Parents Witnesses.
Further details of McDaniel's de
fense was outlined at the noon ad
journment of court, when Judge C. F.
btrop. senior counsel for the accused
prosecutor, declared he intended to
call Mr. McDaniel, his, father and his
mother to the stand. Defense attor
neys previously had refused to state
what witnesses would be called when
their side of the case was presented.
Judge C. F. Strop, chief counsel for
Mr. McDaniel. said today that as yet
no witnesses had been summoned by
his side and that none probably
would be nntil the state had com
pleted its case.
"All our witnesses can be obtained
quickly," he said. "Much of our de
fense will consist of course, of cross
examination of the state's witnesses."
125 Witnesses for State.
Subpoenas have been issued by the
state for 125 witnesses. Among them
are Mrs. Sarah Moss and Miss Ailene
Moss, mother and sister of the slain
woman. It had been understood that
both Mrs. Moss and her daughter be
lieved in the innocence of the indicted
prosecutor.
The selection of the special venire
of forty from which the Jury will be
chosen, continued when court recon
vened. "Have you been approached or
talked to by any one about this case
since you were drawn on the panel ?"
Attorney General Barker questioning
for the state asked prospective jurors
today. No such queries were asked
by him yesterday and. during the first
hours of court this morning no ve
nireman was refused because of un
satisfactory answers to this question.
Pleased With Jury Progress.
St. Jos-eph, Mo., Oct. 24. Pleased
with their unexpected success yester
day afternoon when thirteen venire
men were obtained, attorneys for both
sides, in the trial here of Oscar D.
McDaniel, prosecuting attorney of Bu
chanan county, charged with the mur
der of his wife, expected today to com
plete the list of forty from which will
be chosen the jury.
Only four of the seventeen men ex
amined by John T. Barker, attorney
general of Missouri, heading the pros
euctlon, were rejected. Both men de
clared last night they expected the
same speed would attend their efforts
today.
The beginning of the hearing, com
ing after several continuances, brought
large crowds into the court room. Ex
tra deputies were hastily appointed
by the county sheriff to control the
curious men and women who after
filling ail the seats stood in the aisles
and doors and overflowed inside the
railing before the judge's desk.
Defendant kniillng.
Mr. McDaniel pat smiling thruout
the entire day except for a moment
when it was announced that Mr. Bar
ker had been instructed by Governor
Major to come to the assistance of
Bart M. Lockwood, special prosecutor.
He sat beside his father, one of the
wealthiest farmers of Buchanan coun
ty, while near him were many of his
public associates who have stoutly
maintained his innocence.
The resumption of the trial found
the accused man with his public cam
paign for re-election as county prose
cutor closed and according to his be
lief resting in the verdict of the Jurv.
For almost the first time since he was
released from jail on bond of $50,000,
he failed to speak at a political meet
ing last night.
Additional lights were ordered
placed in the court room by Judge
Ryan late yesterday to make possible
the holding of night sessions si tha't
I the trial might be completed before
the election.

Rumanians Hopeful Allies Will
Come to Rescue Nation.
On both the north and southeastern
Rumanian fronts the Teutonic allies
are rapidly flattening out the Ruman
ian lines and forcing them back.
In Dobrudja, Field Marshal von
Mackensen inflicted a severe defea4
upon the Russo-Rumanian left flank,
driving it to the Tara Murat district,
some sixteen miles northwest of Son
stanza, the Black sea port he cap
lured day before yesterday. In the
center the field marshal has forced
his way into Medjirie, while along the
Danube he has drawn appreciably
nearer the Tchernavoda bridgehead
by capturing the Danube town of
Rashova, nine miles southwest of
Tchernavoda. He has- taken 6,700
prisoners, two cannon and fifty-two
machine guns. -
Driving home the attack on the north
General von Falkenhayn reports as
a result the capture of Predeal, ten
miles south of Kronstadt, on the Ru
manian side of the border, and the
collapse of the strong resistance the
Rumanians have been offering at the
southern end of Rothenthurm pass, on
the frontier south of Hermannstadt.
On the northwestern Rumanian
front the Russo-Rumanian forces ap
parently are hold their own. Bucharest
reports them on the offensive in the
Oituz valley, where several hundred
prisoners and ten machine guns were
captured from General von Falken
hayn's troops.

London reports that the British

neighborhood of Gueudecourt and Les
Boeufs, where the capture of 1,000
vards of German trenches was report
ed. There was no infantry action
along the French lines in the Somme
region, the most important happening
being the development of a spirited
artillery duel south of the river in the
area between Biaches and Ablaincourt.
Short on Artillery,
Mackensen's easy victory at Con
stanza was due partly to the Russo
Rumanian'g lack of artillery, it is un
derstood here. When Falkenhayn be
gan sweeping the Rumanians out of
Transvlvania, the Rumanians hastily
shifted guns from Dobrudja to the
Transylvania passes to check the in
vasion of their western borders. The
Russians brought reinforcements in
men into Dobrudja but were unable to
bring adequate artillery equipment
and the enemy batteries were unable
to offer effective opposition to the
Teutonic advance.
One report from Sofia today said
that Constanza was won with hardly
any fighting, the Rumanians evacuat
ing shortly after German detachments
cut the railroad to the west.
Cavalry forces entered the city in
the afternoon and found it deserted
by the enemy.

Paris. Oct. 24. 5:25 a. m. The
capture of Constanza by the Teutonic
allies altho not unexpected, neverthe
less has put a damper on the enthusi
asm aroused by the continued advance
of the entente allies on the front in
Picardy. French commentators do
not unduly exaggerate the importance
of the achievement of Field Marshal
von Mackensen, whose action up to
the present time, is considered here as
a defensive one in shortening his
front so as to hold it better if with
fewer men. They point out that the
only way that he could do this, is ad
vance, since if he fell back, his frunt
would on the contrary, be lengthened
insofar as he succeeued. These ob
servers Pay also that ft he manages to
tie up the Russo-Rumanian forces in
Dobrudja by holding a narrow front
slightly south of the railroad, he will
not be slow to employ his troops thus

Wagered in One Day.
New Tork, Oct. 24. Candidate
Charles E. Hughes, speaking ia
Queensboro tonight, may have some
thing to say about the hyphen charges.
The candidate himself was silent early
today, but those close to him suggest
ed he may reply to the Democratic
claims.
The Democratic national committee
continues its hyphen drive against hiia
today. Their latest installment in the
series concerning the admitted con
ference between Hughes and the
American Independence conference
linked the name of Supreme Court
Justice Cohalan of this city as with
the hyphen organization. It named
him as a speaker to the "conferees
and claimed he had urged getting in
touch with Republican leaders more
closeiy.
Answering this. Chairman Willcox
of the Republican national committee
reiterated his statement that Hughes
had made the organization no pledgee,
had entered into no agreement or
deal.
Claim Anti-Allies Speech followed.
The Democratic contention is that
Hughes uttered anti-ally attacks sub
sequent to his conference with the in
dependence group. At one point, the
Democratic document says, his attack
on Wilson's "surrender to force" in
the eight-hour law was regarded as
strong, but not wholly satisfactory.
Willcox charged that the Demo
crats were seeking hyphen favor. The
Hughes talk with the independence
organization and the American rights
committee was at the solicitation of
f tne organization, he said, while he
I Democratic statement was a letter to
i aay OI ine campaign.
