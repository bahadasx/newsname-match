Bucharest. Near the center of .
their front, which extends across
the Dobrudja from the sea to the
Danube, the invaders have cut
the railroad near Murfatlar and

Berlin.

EAST LAS VEGAS. N. M.. Oct 23.
Theodore Roosevelt, in a twenty
minute speech here tonight criticized
President Wilson's Mexican policy
and urged his hearers to vote for
'Charles Evans Hughes and "real Am
ericanism." ;
Do As In Cuba
The United States, he said, in
order to finally restore order in
Mexico, "must restore our pres-,
tjge to .its proper government
just as was done in Cuba."
Colonel Roosevelt declared that the
Wilson foreign policies had placed the
United States in contempt before the
world. "General Pershing," he said,
"should have been sent after Villa
with orders to get him In spite of
Carranza or any other leader who
might endeavor to interfere."
He added that if he were called up
on to raise a division to go into Mexi
co he would call upon citizens or New
Mexico or Mexican origin because he
had round them loyal Americans and
good fighters, when they served with
him and his Rough Riders.

PEACE
TALK
For Posterity's Sake, For
Peace of World Hereafter,
Germany Must Be Ground
Into Dust, Says Britisher.
BUT AFTER WAR, ALL
NATIONS MUST UNITE
Hopeful Neutral Powers Will
Evolve Out of Chaos of
War, a Way to Definite,
Everlasting Peace. -
(Z: Review Leased Wire!
LONDON. Oct. 23. Another Im
portant contribution to the discussions
on peace was made by Viscount Grey,
secretary for foreign affairs, at a
luncheon given today by the Foreign
Press Association, at which the dip
lomatic representatives of all the al
lied countries were present.
Must Prevent Future Ware
The foreign secretary made it plain
that the allies were not prepared to
discuss peace terms and gave no in
dication of what their terms might be.
but welcomed any efforts by neutral
countries for a commission to prevent
future wars. Some of the most im
portant passages of the secretary's
speech follow:
Not Ready For Peace
"I would like to talk, not indeed,
about actual conditions of peace that
can only be stated as formulated, but
bout the general object which the al
lies must secure in this war. And to
do that I would ask you to recall that
we must never forget how the war
came about If we are to approach
peace in a proper spirit it can only
be by recollecting and recalling, and
never for a moment forgetting what
was the real cause of the war.
Mustn't Forget Dead
"Some people say. Oh. we need not
go back o-.r that old ground now;
everybody knows it
"You cannot go back to it too often.
It effects the conditions of peace. Ger
many talks of peace: her statesmen
talk of peace today. They say:
" 'Germany must have guarantees
against being attacked again. If this
war had not been forced upon Ger
many that would be a logical state
ment. It is precisely because It was
not forced upon Germany, but was
rorced by Germany upon Europe that
it is the allies who must have a guar
antee for future peace.
Blames Germany
"In July. 1914. no one thought of
attacking Germany. I is said that
Russia was the first to mobilize. That.
I understand, is what is reported in
Germany as justification for th state
ment that the war was not an aggres
sive war on Germany's part, but was
forced upon her.
Russia's Mobilization
"Russia never made the mobiliza
tion of wh'ch Grmany has complain
ed until after Germany refused a con
Terence, and never made It until after
tve renort appeared in Germany that
Gerany had ordered mobilization
and that reports had reached Petro
grnd. "The who'e plan of campaign of the
German staff was to attack through
Belgium and now It Is represented
that they had to attack thro-t;:': Bel
gium because our people had planned
to attack through Belgium. I would
like noth'ng better han to see those
statements that Russia's mobilization
was an aggressive one and that other
Powers, any other power, had traf
ficked In the neutrality of Belgium
or planned an attack through Belgium
I would like to see those statements
Investigated before an independent
in-partial tribunal.
"German organization is Tery suc
cessful in some thines. but in noth
ing more successful than in prevent
ing the truth from reaching their peo
ple and in presenting to them a point
of view which is not that of truth.
Allies Wanted Conference
"When England proposed a coher
ence, Russia, France and Italy ac
cepted the conrerence, and one power
reru.d it. When four powers offered
a conference and one power refused
it. is It the powers which offered the
conference who are forcing the war
or !s it the power that is refusing it?
