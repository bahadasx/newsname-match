OUT FOR WILS
Former Progressive Leader in
Indiana Works For Pres
ident's Reelection.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Oct. 24.
W. I). Headrick, progressive leader
In Indiana, has declared himself for!
Woodrow Wilson. So strong in his
tonviction that all progressiven
should support the president that
he is making a tour of the state on
his own responsibility. He is on of
the strongest speakers in Indiana
and his name will attract large au
diences. When progressives were making
up their Indiana ticket Mr. Head
rick could have had any place he
would accept, but as chairman of
the state convention he expressed
the wish to retire from politics. He
was que of the tirst republicans in
Indiana to become a progresses e in
l'Jl'2 and was one of the powers in
that campaign and again in 1114.
In a speech at Indianapolis last
week Mr. Headrick said, among
things:
Follows llost .lodgment.
"I am tor Wilson because I have
tried to give the matter careful con
sideration and am now following
what is to me my best judgment. I
have, a deep-seated conviction that
he is for the masses as against Wall
st 'when the interests of Wall st
and those of the masses contlict.
The picture of 'Mary and the sine
clad cottage' is still with me, and I
still beliee the hand of the invisible
government is busily ngaged in try
ing to defeat Wilsot,. He is for
proper defens. and a' the same time
i: doing his best to avoid war.
Hughes has appealed to the progres
sives to forget past differences and
work hand in hand with the repub
licans to secure his election. I am
still a progressise and am support
ing Wil.-on because of that fact. It
impossible for me to forget a dif
ference either past or present, when
that difference is a principle."

Kapid progress is being made on
Lincoln way W., according to the
report of the Chamber of Commerce

WASHINGTON. Oct. 24. -
The
continued victory of Francisco Villa's
army over th troops of the defacto
government of Mexico was reported
to Washington today in dispatches
which forecast the recapture by
Villa at an early date of. Chihuahua,
chief city of northern Mexico.
Carranza, according to today's
report is in serious straits. His
troops under fJen. Trevino, worn out
by tsvo days' fighting around Chihua
hua, with Villa's forces, victorious,
have shot assay practically all of
their ammunition.
Worsted in the fighting and with
out sutlicient troops of supplies, ('en.
Trevino has been obliged to appeal
to Juarez for reinforcements. It

the arrival of Senoras Car-anza and

That Obregon and his chief intend
staying a considerable period In
Queretaro is indicated by the fact
that t0 c arloads of munitions as well
as other supplies have been sent to
the latest refuse of the tirst chief
j and his svar minister. The return

GFNCVA, Oct. IM. Fears that
M Venizelos may use his revolu

pose f overthrowing the govern

openly expressed in Athens, says a
dispatch received here today.
Although the Greek goserntnent
has previously stated its willingness
to withdraw troops from Larissa, it
hs nosv protesting against the allies'
demand that all the Grt;ek soldiers
be withdrawn from Thessaly. It is
declared by Constantine's advisers
that the Greek troops are needed
there to prevent the revolutionary
army from marching on Athens.
International News Service:

in Athens is nosv calm," says a dis
patch from that city today. "The
Greeks are no longer making hos

Hilf DISPUTE
EAGHES CRISIS
Diplomatic Break With Neigh
bor is Feared in Some
Quarters in. Germany.
Inteniatieri.il NYsvs Servi.-e:
AMSTi:RDAM, ct. 21. A cri-is
has arisen between Germany and
Norway, the climax of which, it is
feared in some juarters in Germany,
may be a diplomatic: freak between
the two countries. At the s.uue time
there are symptoms of a gradual
tendency on the part of Sw h n to
ward the entente allies, symjuoms
which in pro-ally circles here are
sfantial agreements, and possibly an
alliance.
The continuance of "friendly re
lations" betsvt en Germany and Nor
way depends upon the latter govern-
merit's anssver to Ferlin's note lc -
manding recesshm from the stand
taken regarding the tre.itment of
German submarines in op n Norwe -
gian ssaters. The original Norwe
gian note on this subject was r--sentcd
by the German foreign of
lice as "un f rien! ly" in ton' and in
tent and tiie German government in
turn sent a sharp demand to Chris
tiania demanding a backdown.
Added anxiety was cause J in Fer
lin today, according to dispatch s
from the Germars capital, by the
news of the agreement i ached o..--tween
Swedr and Russia lor the
release of vessels detained in Rus
sian ports. Similar negotiations ar
reported under way between "sve.-den
