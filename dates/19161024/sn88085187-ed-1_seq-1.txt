HUGHES IS
PARTY TO
VILE PLOT
The conspiracy between Candidate Hughes and!
the professional <iorinan-Ainericans to drive Prett"
dent Wilson out of office because lie compelled war*
mad Germany to conduct its submarine activities iui
conformity with international law, is the most vii-
American thing that ever has occurred in a president
tial campaign.
Wo use the word conspiracy advisedly. What oth
er Interpretation < ism be put upon the attitude <>4
Hughes, who, knowing or the activities of: these pro
fessional German-Americans, that their declare<J
purpose is to discipline the president of the United
States, by his silence consents to he the beneficiary!.
The "hundred percent candidate" may talk ahout'
"undiluted Americanism" until ho is black in the
face. Such expressions are meaningless.
But his attitude toward the German-American
anti-Wilson propaganda is full of meaning.
It is the altitude of a man who is so obsessed witii
the ambition to gain the presidency thai ho is willing,
to accept the office at the hands of t liohc who braz
enly put the interests of a foreign nation ahead of
the interests of the United Stales.
What other meaning can bo read into the bittwf
Fight which the professional German-Americans ar»i,
making against the president?
They do not even try to cover up the motives that!
animate them.
Has one of them said that he is against Wilson he*
cause he has betrayed America I
No; the president has betrayed Germany in the in
terest of America, therefore, he must be defeated.
Thlk is the president's offense. For this, every]
voter with the fraction of a drop of German blood in
his veins is called upon to drive Wilson out of the,
presidency and to put Hughes in.
Jt was this influence more than any other that de
feated Koosevelt for the republican nomination and
made Hughes the candidate.
If Hughes should he elected it will he this infill*
ence that will have elected him.
There is no getting away from this fact.
It is the big, outstanding fact of the campaign.
The election of Hughes, under these circumstances,
would be notice to Germany that the majority of the
American people disapprove of the firm stand taken
by President Wilson against submarine warfare.
It is not at all unlikely that the final decision by)
the (lerman government, as to whether it ahull re
sume unrestricted submarine warfare, has been de
ferred until after the presidential election.
When a vote on this proposition was taken in the'
(jcrman reichstag recently, the result was very dosat.
Of course the determining factor was President
Wilson's ultimatum.
Let the German-Americans defeat Wilson on this
issue as they are frankly trying to do, with the assist
ance of Hughes, and the vote in the reichstag will bo'
different.
THE WHOLE SITUATION IS FULL OF DYNA
MITE AND ANY MAN WHO IS A PARTY TO IT,
AS HUGHES IS, IS UNFIT TO BE PRESIDENT.
WILSON WAVE SWEEPING
GRAYS HARBOR COUNTRY
The Grays Harbor country, tra
ditionally a republican strong
hold, is being swept by a Wilson
wave.
This is the report brought back
to Tacoma by James D. Smyths,
engineer, and secretary of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engi
neers In Tacoma, after a week's
visit in cities and towns of >.h«
district.
"Everywhere I went," he said
Tuesday, "I met old-time repub
licans who are out-and-out for
Wilson.
"In the business section of
Aberdeen I could find only one
Hughes campaign picture, while
pictures of President Wilson ap
peared in the dlbplay window* of
'stores and business houses every
where.
"Of the 199 registered voter*
In fosmopolls, I found that 132
were members of the Wilson In
dependent league.
"Traveling men and other pas
sengers on the trains were nearly
all talking Wilson. On one train
a straw vote was taken with this
result:
"Wilson, 116; Hughes, 14;
Bention, '1; Hauler, 3."
Smythe said that the railway
trainmen in Tacoma and through
out ilin state are solid for th«j
president.
"Better Uian 99 per cent of to*
men In Tacoma are going to voUl
for Wilson," he declared.
