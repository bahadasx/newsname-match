REPUBLICAN TALKS
BEFORE JAMES TELLING WHY
HE WILL VOTE FOR WILSON
Both U. S. Senators Address Big
Crowds In This Section More
Speaking Dates.
Two great speeches for Democracy
were delivered up in this neck of the
woods Monday by Kentucky's two dis
tinguished United States Senators.
Senator James spoke at Somerset and
Senator Beckham at Mt. Vernon.
Both were heard by tremendous au
diences and made magnificent speech
es. Before Senator James spoke at
Somerset, Edward Weddle, a mem
ber of the prominent family of that
name in Pulaski county, and who has
been a life-long republican, told why
he will vote for Woodrow Wilson this
year and gave many strong argu
ments why every working man should
vote the same way. Weddle is an em
ploye of the Cincinnati Southern and
made a telling talk and is doing a fine
-work for Wilson, who, he says, has
proven himself the friend of the poor
and the laboring man while Hughes
is known to be the candidate of the
rich interests.
A crowd of 3,000 people were held
entranced for alomts three hours by
Senator James great speech. The big
senator has been speaking all over
the west for Wilson and declares that
Wilson is a sure winner.
Senator Beckham was also heard
by one of the biggest gatherings ev
er seen in Mt. Vernon on such an oc
casion, and his plea for votes for the
greatest president since Lincoln was
a masterly one and went right to the
hearts of the people who heard him.
More speaking dates have been ar
ranged for the closing days of the
campaign in Lincoln county. Hon.
Orie S. Ware, of Covington, who was
at first scheduled, has been unable
to get away, so George Dupree, who
is said to be a splendid speaker, will
take his place at Waynesburg and
Hustonville. Dates so far arranged
for speakings in this county are:

Because the coal car shortage has
developed to a point where a steam
coal famine exists in Louisville, as
well as advanced prices on domestic
coal, action by the Interstate Com

Mrs. Owsley Hurt
Buggy Turns Over When It Strikes
Rock Pile On Danville Pike
Mrs. John Sam Owsley, wife of the
well known local attorney, sustain
ed a very painful and severe frac
ture of her right ankle Monday night
about six o'clock when a buggy in
which she and Mrs. . W. A. Tribble
were returning from Danville struck
a pile of rock which had been left
piled up in the center of the pike
near the residence of J. Frank Smith
by the construction crew at work re
building the pike, with no red lan
tern to indicate its presence. When
the buggy struck the heaped up
stone, and began to go over, Mrs.
Tribble jumped and saved herself,
but Mrs. Owsley was caught under
the vehicle, and it is regarded as very
fortunate that she was not more se
riously hurt. There was a passway
on each side of the stone heap, but
in the darkness neither of the ladies
saw the obstruction in the center of
the pike as there was no light upon
it, and the place where the accident
occurred is several hundred yards
outside the city limits.
Luckily the horse they were driv
ing made no effort to run away. Mrs.
Owsley was quickly taken to the
home of Mr. Smith, where her brok
en limb was set by a physician, after
which W. H. Shanks took her to her
apartments at Mrs. Tribble's home
in his motor car.
The injury is a very painful and se
rious one, and will keep her confined
to her bed for some time. The bug
gy these ladies were in is said to
have been the third to have turned
over on the rocks on this pike, since
reconstruction work began. This was
the only accident which had a seri
ous termination, however.
Freight Cars In Ditch
Ten Cars Jump Track Near Hemp
About Noon Saturday
Ten freight cars on the train run
by Engineer Fox Dudderar and Con
ductor J. A. Carter, of this city, went
off the track and cluttered up sever
al hundred yards of the right of way,
a short distance west of Hemp about
noon Saturday. Luckily the engine
was not pulled from the track and no
one was hurt. The cars which went
over were two cars of coal, five cais
of rock ballast, one car of scrap iron
and two empties. Most of the cars
and contents went down an enbank
ment into the farm of James H.
Woods, who bought some mighty
cheap coal from the railroad as a re
sult of the wreck. What caused the
spill is totally unknown. The wrecker
from Lebanon was soon at work. The
2:30 K. C. to Louisville had to be
routed around by Nicholasville, but
the roadway was in shape for 22 to
run toward Louisville at 6 o'clock.

HOW CATARRH IS CONTRACTED
Mothers are sometimes so thought
less a s otngelTienecedlebr -hacohh
less as to neglect the colds which
their children contract. The inflam

acute, becomes chronic and the child
has a chronic catarrh, a disease that
is seldom cured and that many prove
a life's burden. Many persons who
have this loathsome disease will re

the time it was contracted. A little
forethought, a bottle of Chamber

been avoided. Obtainable everywnere.
First Class Football
Shown by Stanford Boys Who De
feat Richmond Normal 26 to 14
In one of the best and most keen
ly contested football games ever seen
on the Stanford gridiron, Stanford
High defeated the eleven of Eastern
Norpial here Monday afternoon by a
score of 26 to 14. The game was a
battle royal from beginning to end,
and was decided purely and simply
by the speed of the local lads, who
outguessed and outplayed at an open
game their opponents who must have
outweighed them from 15 to 25
pounds or more to the man. The
Normal team was said by a Richmond
man who came over for the game,
to have averaged 175 pounds, but
its backfield was so slow that it nev
er seemed to get started, and only
in spurts was the weight of the hea
vy football engine able to count
against its much lighter opposition.
A big crowd was out to the game,
but few thought that Stanford had
a chance. Several auto loads of
Richmond rooters came over to see
the slaughter, as Normal had de
feated Stanford by such an over
whelming score there a short time
ago. The eyes of all were opened
when in the very first half minute
of play Sam Embry shot a forward
pass to his brother Joe T. Embry,
and vthe latter ran through a broken
field, for about 40 yards to a touch
down. The big feature of the game
was - the forward passing of these
Embry boys, which was responsible
for 90 per cent of the groundgaining
made by the local eleven. Very few
times did they fail for gains when
this was attempted, while Richmond
was unsuccessful in most of her at
tempts at this style of play, and
made most of her gains by straight
line bucking, where her superior
weight told.
Stanford scored three touchdowns
in the first quarter of play, the first
on the Embry brothers' forward pass.
On the next kickoff, Stanford kicked
to Normal, held the visitors three
downs, and then when Richmond
endeavored to punt, Joe Embry
blocked the punt, and his brother a
minute afterward went around left
end for the second touchdown. Tuc
ker kicked goals. Another forward
passWas carried over by Joe Em
bryaf ter .a few minutes of play, but
TueksiWf ailed at. goaL- Score 20 to
or ''
Normal scored her first touchdown
in tKe second quarter by straight
line plunging, and McDougal kicked
goals. Stanford held desperately
right at the goal line for three
downs, but the visitors pushed a man
over on their fourth and last chance.
In the third quarter Stanford
started off in a procession down the
field, Sam Embry forward passing to
Joe Embry and to Joe Hill, but a
fumble on Richmond's 20-yard line
caused the ball to go over. Stan
ford's line was so strong that Rich
mond was forced to punt. Hembree
caught a forward pass from Stanford
but lost the ball on downs on Stan
ford's 20-yard line. A forward pass
thrown by Sam Embry was caught
by a Richmond player on Stanford's
30-yard line; and Richmond put over
one of her few successful passes and
went over for her second touchdown,
and as goal was kicked, the score
stood 20 to 14.
The fourth quarter was bitterly
fought, and at several points it seem
ed that feeling was becoming so in
tense that blows would be struck.
Bryan Perkins, who was forced to
leave the game in the first quarter
when he and Spalding Hill collided
both going for a forward pass catch,
went back and the Richmond referee
put him out of the game, charging
rough work. Stanford players de
clared that "Perk," who was playing
a star game all the time, was not at
fault, but the referee had the last
say. Soon after the kickoff, Stan
ford was penalized 25 yards, but
braced and held for downs. After
two forward passes failed, Tucker
punted to the visitors' 15-yard line,
and Hunn got the ball, and Sam Em
bry took it over by a left end run
on the next play. Richmond tried
hard but could never get within
striking distance of the local goal
line and the game ended 26 to 14, as
no goal was kicked on the last touch
down. The Line-up.

ANOTHER STAR FROM HERE
Stanford and Lincoln county have
produced a number of young men
who have shone as stars on various
college and university foot ball and
base ball teams, and now has come to
the front with one of her sons who
is making a great record as a mem
ber of the football team which rep
resents that portion of Uncle Sam's
regular army stationed at Fort Mc
Knley, Maine. This young man is
Coleman Lutes, of Stanford, who
has been in the army some little
time. He is plaving right end on the
army eleven of Fort McKinley which
has lost but one game this year and
has played such strong teams as Col
by, Bate and the University of New
Hampshire nd the eleven of the
cruiser San Francisco. Lieut. Ste
vall, the" army coach, an old football
man himself, says that Lutes is the
best all around football player that
he ever saw. Lutes is the youngest
son of Mr. and Mrs. John Lutes, of
Stanford. He will be home about
Nov. 5th.
THAT EAST END CULVERT.
County Road Engineer McKee
Riffe, who has about the biggest job
of any county official, in supervising
the entire 800 or so miles of roads in
Lincoln county, and is kept on the
jump all the time, says that a wrong
impression has been given of the
condition of a certain culvert in the
East End by the I. J.'s corerspondent
at Preachersville. In order to set
the matter right, Mr. Riffe gave the
I. J. the following statement:
In regard to the article by the
Preachersville correspondent in Fri
day's I. J., I wish to correct his state
ment of the condition of the cul
verts in that section. Upon my reg
ular trip of inspection last week, I
found the "hog culvert" absolutely
not out of commission, or in any
way dangerous to travel, it having
never been stopped in the two years
of my management, and Mr. Law
rence assured me that it is in prac
tically as good condition as it was
fifteen years ago. But I did find
culverts along the property where
I Mr. Blankenship lives partially- or
wholly stopped by limbs and other
trash washed from his place, and one
twenty-four inch metal tube just in
front of his house with a washtub
placed over the end putting it com
pletely out of commission, and caus
ing the water to overflow the pike.
I also found his very "dangerous
culvert" with a large quantity of de
bris from his farm choking the end,
causing the water to undermine the
walls.
As I have stated before, ninety per
cent of the. damage done by water
to the roads, is caused by the farm
ers obstructing the ditches or cul
verts by carelessly or willfully plac
ing hedge trimmings, limbs from
trees, stones and such like in the
ditches or culverts. If anyone know
ing of a dangerous place in the road
will report same to road engineer,
it will receive his immediate atten
tion, and by thus co-operating with
the engineer more good can be done
than by making undesex-ved and un
just, comments.

IN COUNTRY'S FLAG
SERGEANT JOHN HUBBLE IS
LAID TO REST.
Popular McKinney Young Man Dies
on
Mexican Border Masons
Conduct Funeral Rites
Wrapped in the flag of the coun
try whose cause he served, the re
mains of Sergeant John Hubble were
brought back to his home at McKin
ney Saturday night and returned to
the father who gave his only son to
the service of his country. Sergeant
Hubble died at Fort Bliss, El Paso,
Texas, last Wednesday, Oct. 18th,
after a long illness of dysentery,
complicated with heart trouble. News
of his death caused profound sor
row here and at his home at McKin
ney, where he was so well known and
beloved. John Hubble was a splen
did young man in every way, and
was making a model soldier in the
service of Uncle Sam on the bor
der under Gen. Pershing. He enlist
ed as a private and by devotion to
duty, energy and ability was pro
moted to Sergeant, and seemed des
tined to go still higher, for his mer
it and ability had been frequently
recognized by his superior officers
and most highly commended by them
in every way. His captain and oth
ers who knew him well paid high
and sincere tribute to him in a let
ter to the family, and it is felt gen
erally that the service and the coun
try has lost a most useful soldier and
a citizen of the highest type. He
was just 38 years of age, and had
made his home at McKinney prac
tically all his life when not in the
army. Besides his father, John M.
Hubble, he is survived by four sis
ters. Sergeant Hubble was a member of
the McKinney lodge of Masons and
after religious services at the home
by Rev. R. L. Brandenburg, of Hus
tonville, Monday, the members of
this great fraternity took charge of
the remains and held their beautiful
rites at the grave in Buffalo Springs
cemetery here. Col. C. N. Smith, of
Danville, accompanied by others from
there and over this county, came
over, and conducted the Masonic cer
emonies over the bier of their de
parted brother.
MISS NELL HIGGINS DEAD
Miss Nell Higgins died at the home

took place Tuesday afternoon at
Paint Lick after -services at the

K. P.'S CALL FAIR OFF.
At the regular meeting of the lo
cal Knights of Pythias lodge last
week the lodge voted not to conduct
a fair this year. Many of the mem
bers feel that they should let "well
enough alone" and having come out
on the right side of the ledger after
so many trials, should not tempt for
tune again. It is said to be practical
ly a certainty, however, that a fair
will be held in Stanford promoted by
a stock company. The Stanford fair
has become almost the best adver
tised and known 'country fair in this
section of Kentucky, has done a
great deal toward advertising Stan
ford and Lincoln county and a ma
jority of the business men feel that
it should not be allowed to lapse
especially after such a successful sea
son as it just experienced.
