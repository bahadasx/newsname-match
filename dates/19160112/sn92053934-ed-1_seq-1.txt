ACCEPT FALL
OF ITALIANS'
FORTASTRUE
Report of Austrian Capture
of Mount Lovcen Gener
ally Believed.
VICTORY UNCONFIRMED
Allies Are Silent on Loss of
Stronghold as Given
Out by Vienna.
London. Jan. 12. Announcement of
the occupation of Mount Lovcern in
Montenegro, although not confirmed
from entente sources, is generally ac
cepted here as true. Uneasiness which
is freely expressed in Italy is reflected
in the English and French Newspapers.
The loss of Lovcen, from the point of
view of the allies, is terious owing to
the fact that its summit dominates
Cattaro Bay, the Austrian naval base.
Before Italy entered the war the
French had established a number of
guns which could have swept the bay.
Austria, by seizing it, forstalls this
danger and is in a commanding posi
tion with regard to Cettinje, the cap
ital of Montenegro, which is a little
over six miles distant.
Surmount All Obstacles.
. The Austrian advance, considering
the distance to be covered, was much
slower than that made in the Teuton
conquest of Serbia, but, in considera
tion of the formidable obstacles which
the mountainous ch. racter of liie
country presents, it is conceded that
the invaders are malting steady pro
gress. The question is beir.g anxiously
raised as to why the entente allies
did not long ago send aid to the Mont
enegrins, and in particular why Italy,
which is more acutely affected by this
Austrian invasion, had not taken pre
ventive measures. The Austrians are
now only 10 miles from the capital of
Montenegro, and a successful blow
the heart of the country may have the
effect, it is said, by m.litary critics, of j
isolating the troops who are defending
the northeastern frontier.
(Germans Holding Gain.
In Champagne the Germans hold a
slight gain, made as a result of de-i
termined offensive of last Saturday
and Sunday. The French military au
thorities say that the German forces
which delivered the attack lost heav
ily, as with three divisions, they ad
vanced in face of the French artillery
fire which took terrible toll.
From the eastern front it is reported
that a comparative lull at present pre
vails. Special dispatches affirm that
the Russians have been so successful
in consolidating their new positions
that the Austro-Germans have begun
to remove supplies from the bases
which they had established in prepara
tion for the advance which they in
tended to make in the coming spring.
No Grounds
for Scandal
of Fire Bugs
Ottumwa, Iowa, Jan. 12. Fire CMef
Sloan, the mayor and city commiu
tioners of Ottumwa deny that the
state fire marshal was called to this
city to investigate the $400,000 fire
of Tuesday morning and assert that
there is no ground for the rumor of in-1
cendiarism. The officials brand
the
aifi
story of fire bugs as sensational an
unwarranted by facts and state that
the starting of small fires in the rear
of two business houses some distance
from the seen of the big blaze was
due to sparks.
INSANE WOMAN
VISITS CAPITAL
Washington, D. C, Jan. 12. Mrs.
Emma Jensen, 40 years old, Minne
apolis, Minn., created a scene last night
at the private entrance of the White
house by her hysterical crying. She
"an btopped at the door by a police
man and sent to the Washington asyl

recall her name and address. She told
attending nurses she came all the

dent to relieve a mysterious mental op
pression from which she had greatly
uttered.

Cliicairo, Jan.. 12. In a message
fo Colonel Theodore Koosevelt the
committee preets him ns ''the first
American ai:d foremost statesman
of the world,"' commends his ef

Chicago, Jan. 12. Most of the mem
bers of the Progressive national com
mittee left for their homes today af
ter deciding last night to hold the
national convention in Chicago on
June 7, concurrently with the re
publican national convention.
After the completion of the work of
the committee, many of the leaders
expressed the opinion that the way
had been opened for a common lead
ership of the progressive and re
publican parties.
The next progressive gathering
will be held in New York city prob
ably within two weeks, when the exe
cutive committee of the national com
mittee will assemble for the purpose
of preparing a call and beginning
preparations for the convention.
In the declaration of principle
which was adopted without a dissent
ing vote, the belief was expressed that
the surest way to secure for the
country a suitable leader, will be "by
having both progressive and republi
can parties choose the same standard
bearer and the same principles." Con
tinuing the declaration of principle?
says "if the republican convention is
responsive to the patriotic spirit that
brought the republican party into be
ing and that made it dominant for
half a century; if it meet this crisis
in the spirit of broad patriotism that
rises above partisanship, the effori
for a common leadership will be suc
cessful." Addressing the conference of parcy
leaders, George W. Perkins, chairman
of the executive committee, said: "We
are all hoping that both parties will
agree on somebody and the candidate
need not necessarily be Colonel Roose
velt." II

PALACE GF SIN IS
CLOSEOjOR YEAR
Diamond 'eli t iai'li's Notorious He-
sort in Kaii'-atee is I'ut Out
of i' isiiiess.
Kankakee, 111., Jan. 12 The lid
went down on vice ith a bang here
yesterday that made the whole city
sit up and take notice. Last reports
had the sheriff of the crmnty and his
deputies sitting on it tj make sure
that it isn't pried looso.
The sheriff's attention was concen
trated particularly on the costly vice
palace owned and operated by "Dia-
mona .eu want. - '
Armed with a writ of eviction, the
sheriff early in the day pounced down
on the notorious resort and sent the
inmates scurrying to the street. He
then took possession of the keys to
the place, which had been impounded
by the court for a year.
He acted under instruction of the
court, which yesterday convicted the
Clark woman of conducting a disorder
ly place. Besides being forced out of
$100.
Reformers, mothers and wives her
alded the news with joy. For years
they had fought to close up the Clark
resort, but without the slightest suc
cess. Powerful influences brought to
bear by the owner intervener and
frustrated their attempts.
The resort was nationally notorious
and was regarded by the sporting ele
ment as one of the show places of the
city. More than one scandal had its
inception within its doors.
Despite the many complaints that
had been registered against it, the
lights were never dimmed. It sur
vived through a dozen or more reform
waves through the many years of its
existence. It was often charged that
the owner paid for police protection.
Less that a year ago it was the
scene of a daring bandit raid, when
five armed men held up the Clark wo
man and her maid, escaping with the
resort-keeper's $50,000 collection of
jewels. Several of the robbers were
captured later and part of their loot
recovered. The notoriety given the
place at that time is believed to have
resulted in the campaign which came
to a climax yesterday.

as It. Holmes, the only Ameri
can to escape the massacre ar
rived here today. He declared
that the train was halted at 2
p. m. by a band of bandits which
lie estimated at about 200.
Alter the Americans were taken
off and lined up alongside the
track, they were ordered to dis
robe. Realizing what was about to
occur, he said, he made a break
for liberty with ('. K. Watson,
Tom Evans and Machatton.
They were pursued by about
fifteen bandits who shot all his
companions but missed Holmes.
Holmes said Watson's head was
blown off and that after the bod
ies were brought to Chihuahua
City it was found they had been
riddled with bullets and otherwise
mutilated.
Holmes declared he did not
know who led the bandits.
Washington, Jan. 12. Secretary
Lansing today telegraphed Gen
eral Carranza calling for the
prompt pvnlshment of Uie bandits
who executed lti Americans near
Chihuahua Monday. Through fcli
seo Arredondo, the newly nppoint
ed Mexican ambassador here, it
was arranged to bring the bodies
from Chihuahua to Juarez today
on a special train.
Secretary Lansing's only an
nouncement on the case was that
the United States would look to
(ieneral Carranza "for satisfac
tion." The question of what steps
the United States will take de
pends upon developments of the
facts.
As soon as the senate assembled
Senator Sherman, republican, intro
duced a resolution proposing inter
vention in Mexico by the United States
and the six Pan-American nations
which have acted with it in Mexican
affairs, unless General Carranza com
plies with a demand to protect for
eign lives and property.
Secretary Lansing issued a state
ment in which he said the state de
partment "feels that it took every pos
sible precaution to prevent Americans
from exposing their lives in a region
where guerilla warfare is in prog
ress" and that "it is to be deplored
that its advice was not followed."
"Every step will be taken to see
that the perpetrators of this dastardly
crime are apprehended and punish
ed," he said.
Official Count Sixteen.
Official dispatches from Chihuahua,
Mexico, to the state department today
say the bodies of the 16 Americans
shot by Villa bandits arrived at that
city last night. Customs Collector
Cobb at El Paso today reported that
his investigation seems to establish
that 16 were killed. The state de
partment did not divulge the sources

DOZEN ZEPPELIN
RAIDS ON LONDON
BALKED IN MONTH
New York, Jan. 12. Twelve at
tempted raids on London by Zeppelins
during December were repulsed by
the British chiefly through large fleets
of aeroplanes. Three of the German
aircraft were destroyed or captured,
according to Dr. W. H. Vincent of the
colonial medical corps, who arrived
today on the American liner Philadel
phia.
"The reason why Zeppelins have not
been able to bombard London or its
subuibs since Oct. 14 last," Dr. Vin
cent said, "is because the British have
established an efficient defense against
the German air raiders. During De
cember there were 12 attempts by
Zeppelins to reach London. From two
to four Zeppelins participated in each
attempt. But in no case were the
German dirigibles able to reach even
the outskirts of London."
