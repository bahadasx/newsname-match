But .when the citizens began to all
get on the line at once It was not
long before the pressure got so low
that It could not be kept lighted and
many families took "theirs out or
paper sacks, hastily secured from the
grocers. The gas company got into
immediate communication with the
field, and both compressors were do-
Ins; their best to force the gas
through the mains. All heavy con
sumers were cut off and the entire
output left for domestic purposes.
The management of the gas com

The school board will meet the of
ficials of the gas company today and
see what action will be taken relative
to the gas burners in the school
buildings, which were recently install
ed, and which the school board claims
are not satisfactory.
Superintendent Richards stated this
morning that when the subject of
installing gas in the city schools was
broached by the gas company, it was
understood that the burners were to
be installed by the company without
cost to the school board. In other
words, unless they gave satisfaction,
the company was to losa whatever
expense might be entailed. On the
other hand, the school board members
stated that In the event the burners
gave satisfaction and sufficient gas
was supplied to properly heat tha
buldings, the board would gladly pay
for them.
