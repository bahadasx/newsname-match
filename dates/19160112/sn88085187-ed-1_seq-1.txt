How Many Monkeys Are You?
THE TREE
By Alfred Kreymborg
I am four monkeys.
One hangs from a limb,
Tail-wi.se,
Chattering at the earth;
Another is filling his belly with
oocoanut;
The third is up in the top
branches,
Quizzing the sky;
And the fourth —
He's chasing another monkey.
How many monkeys are yoni
The Times poets are sore to
day. Just as they thought they
were budding forth into real
enough bards and were contcm
tjlati*ig a vacation from the bar
ber shops, here comes this
Kreymborg fellow, accepted
high brow artist, with this poem
in a high-brow New York maga
zine, The New Republic.
It's an insult to the noble art
of poesy, say we. Either that, or
we're not wise to this pome game
at all, at all.
Telegraph dispatches to The
Times announce that All" calls
his stuff Verse Libre. Up to date,
don 'if you know. In other words,
he lexi his tail ends fly loose in
the wind to starboard.
"Go ahead, Borgy, old boy; be
'steeu monkeys as long as you
like and hang by your loose tail
ends," says li' Loss, our top
notch muse artist. "But as for
us, we decline the compliment, so
you needn't get so d —n imperti
nent."
D'Loss is really downright
peeved. He calls' Alf's stuff
Tacoma's
Plumbers
on the Go
Practically every plumber In
' town was on the jump all day to-
day.
It was estimated that more
than 300 houses reported brok
en water pipes an a result of the
freete. When the thaw comes
this number 1b expected to be
# < greatly increased by the discov
ery of trouble in houses that are
standing, vacant and in which the
breaking of the pipes has not yet
L tnnde itself apparent.
k^r Milk bottles in all parts of town
r^ also froze solid in hundreds of
cases.
Plumbers Issued a warning to
f day against repetitions of the
' mistake made by a woman yes
terday in starting a hot fire in
her stove when the pipe leading
to the water tank was frozen. In
her case an explosion resulted
which Inflicted Injuries that may
lirove fatal.
"If the pipe leading from the
heating coll to the tank is froz
en," said T. H. Belllngham,
plumber, today, "It should be
thawed out by burning a paper
under it, or otherwise, before
fir* Is started In the stove. If
that Is not done stoam will be
P generated in the constricted ipac«
and an explosion will follow."

to sue him for libel if he doesn't
cut it out.
Besides, he points out, the lat
est is that we're descended from
pigs, not monkeys.
Everybody's up in the air.
The city hall reporter thinks
maybe the pome may refer to his
four T. \C & P. commissioners.
The meaning of the pome ■* |J|
; inn ni'llM visions it. Ijl
The Times artist is inclined to
take the stuff seriously. He's
sure Alf has hit on something of
tremendous importance to the
thinking \\*orld.
He has produced a sketch
showing his impressions on read
ing the poem.
Take a look at it.

however, Mfter two hours'

Mayor Kawcet'.'s vote for the
ordinance was the surprise of the
session.
"I want to explain my vote,"
gentlemen," said the mayor to
the crowd.
"When tills ordinance was first
brought up it was rotten no rot
ten tint it hound the city to pay
an exorbitant price for emergency
Ntctrictty. I il'MiiHiuied tlm it

"Although there are many fea

omitted which I think should bo

because It contains the provision
I demanded, although I know It is
not what the city should have."
During the early part of the
session Fitwcett made a spirited
fight for three amendments. The
council had already passed sever
al minor amendments prepared
som«tlme ago by City Attorney
Stiles.
During,his filibuster, tlie may
or engaged in a heated tilt with
Manager Bean, who occupied a
prominent plate near the council
table.
Fawcett's amendments de
manded extension of the Sixth
avenu« street car line along Stev
ens street, immediate extension
of Pacific avenue line to 4 6th and
later extension next year to 64th
| and a '■> per cent tax on power
earnings of the T. R. &. P. Co. In
stead of 2 per pnt. The mayor
moved that his amendments l>e
Incorporated in the ordkiance.
All four commissioners • hung
their heads. Thsre was no sec
ond to the motion.
Bean jumped up from his seat.
"There should be no snr
inisc that there in no second
to this motion," lie declitred,
turning to the crowded ;iml
ience chamber. "The mayor
is a«king for something that
he cannot expert to gala at
thlM time. We nre in no con
dition to grant the <onces-
HionH which he demands."'
Cat-calls, hoots, and loud
laughter greeted his statement.
Fawcett flared up instantly.
"I want to know what Bean
has got to do with the running of
this council," he shouted shaking
his finger at the street car mag
nate.
'My God, aren't we all free
born American citizens? What
right have you to come In here
and say what this council nhall
do? It isn't up to you to make
any remarks because this council
refuses to do what the peopM
want It to."
"Tim company haa done
everything it can for the city
in this franchlne," replied
Bean weakly. "There l«n't
another concession we ran
make."
"That isn't true," cried
Fawcett. "Vim know that
