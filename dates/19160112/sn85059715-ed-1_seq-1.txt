( V AHOCIATIO ABCtC)
LONDON", Jan. 12?The announcement
of the occupation of Mount
Lovcen in Montenegro, although it iR
not continued from Entente sources,
is generally accepted here as true.
Uneasiness, which is already freely
expressed in Italy, Is reflected in the
English and French newspapers. The
loss of Lovcen from the point of
view of the Allies is serious owing to
the fact that its summit dominates
(,'attaro bay, the Ausarian naval bast.
Before Italy entered the war the
French had established a number of
guns on the mountain and had prepared
emplacements for heavy guns,
which could have Bwept the bay.
Austria by seizing It forestalls this
hunger and Is in a commanding position
with regard to Cettinje, the capital,
of Montenegro, which is little
over six miles distant although sheltered
by Intervening mountains.
the distance to be covered was niucb
slower than that made in the Teuton
conquest of Serbia, but in consideration
of the formidable obstacles,
which the mountainous character of
the country presents, It is conceded
that the Invaders are making steady
progress.
I ' The question is being anxiously
raised as to why the Entente Allies
did not long ago send aid to the
Montenegrins and in particular why
Italy, which is more acutely affected
by the Austrian invasion, had not
taken preventative measures. The
Austrians are now only ten miles
from the capital of Montenegro, cal- ,
dilating the distance over the exist- |
ing road and a successful blow at th" (
heart of the country may have the cf- ,
feet, it is said by military critics, of
Isolating the troops who are defending
the northeastern frontier.

a slight gain as a result of the determined
offensive of last Sunday. .
The French military authorities say
that the German forces, which dellv- j
ered the atack. lost heavily as with (
three divisions {hey advanced in the
face pf the French artillery lire which
took a terrible toll.
From the eastern front it is re-.
ported that a comparative lull at '
present prevails. Special despatches
nflirm that the Russians have been so j
successful in consolidating their new J

PRISONERS [
Are Worked on the Roads with ;
Good Success as Shown by
Official Report.
MORGANTOWN, Jan. 12.?That 1
county prisoners can be worked
profitably on county highways has
been shown conclusively by the report
of Sheriff C. D. Conaway, of
Marjon county. During the year
1914, county prisoners in that county
labored just 2,940 days on the 1
county roads, the work done varying
from the laying of 1,000 feet of paved jl
roads through Norwood, a suburb of
lng the prisoners to and from the jail,
slips nlong the many county roa'ds. ,i
While the county was forced to spend i
I.. *U? ,
ft large Hum Ul Illuue; iu luc .. ?j ?1
employing guards and providing food i
and clothing for the prisoners the
authorities state that the returns justified
the expenditure.
County officers are advocating the1
purchase of a motor truck hy the j I
county for the purpose of transport- i
lng the prisoners to and fro mthe jail. ]
it being found that considerable time
was wasted going and coming. With 1
a motor truck the prisoners could be
whisked to any part of the county In 1
a very few minutes and tho danger I
of escape would also be reduced to a
minimum. The truck could also be I
used in transporting materials for the ,
bridges, carrying stone, gravel and I
other road building materials. The i
most prisoners were worked during j
the month of June In Marlon county, i
the list reaching 469 men.

been honored by iin appointive of-;
lice in any of the state departments;
therefore, our people feel that we deserve
some recognition at the hands
of the Republican party, especially In
view of the fact that Logan county,
with its recent developments, and almost
inexsaustible resources, is des-1
lined to become, in the near future,
one of the greatest and wealthiest
counties in the state.
The rapid growth of the Republican
party in this county, by renson
of recent industrial development,
leads us to the inevitable conclusion
that it will be but a short time until
Logan county will be numbered us
one of the leading Republican coun- j
ties of the state.
While I have been a member of
the state Senate, and as president of
that body, I have always advocated
the enactment of such laws as I believed
would bring the greatest good
to the greatest number of people, at
the same time seeking to be just to
all the legitimate industries of our
great and growing Btate. I have no
entangling alliances with any one or
any faction, if we have such in our
party, but am a candidate on my own
merits, whatever they may be. It
Is more than likely that I will make
an aggressive campaign, but at the!
same time, It will be conducted upon
the most friendly terms with ray opponents,
whoever they may be.
I am entering this contest with
th? expectation of winning, as I feel
very confident I will, but, should 1
lose the nomination, then I will do,
what is within my power to elect
my successful opponent. It is the
greatest desire of my heart to she a
united Republican party: a united
party spells victory, both in the state i
an In the nation.
The general trend of sentiment [
seems to be toward the Republican!
party; the party of progress; the;

But No Very Serious Flood
Damage from It is Looked
For Here.
Much damage has been wrought iin
the rcHult of the flootl, which enrly
today threatened to UHUtime a moat
aerloua aspect at Weston when the
West Kork ot the Monongahellt river
had reached a depth of six feel In the
principal streets and was rising six
Inches an hour.
At noon the llood had reached its
height, although it was not expected
It would begin to fall until night. Heports
from the surrounding country
told of bridges washed away and
much other property damaged. Itoanvlllo
and Olenvllle, towns along (he
Little Kanawha river, are mid to have
suffered severely.
No fatalities are reported.
The West Kork began rising late
vestnrrluv 11 f I it a Inne rainfall and
at midnight It wiir out of its banks.
Traction lines entering Weston were
soon under tour feet of water and by
daybreak the electric light plnnt was
flooded. Soon afterwurds the waterworks
were closed down and the
Baltimore nnd Ohio railroad ceased
to operate. Second street wns covered
to a depth of six feet nnd In
the business section the basements
of stores rapidly filled with water.
East Weston, a suburb with 8,000
population, suffered severely, the oc'cupanls
of entire blacks being compelled
to move.
Tho flood of 1888 In July at the
crest was OGJ 1-2 feet above sen
level. The measurement today at
, 11:30 a. m. was only 931 feet at the
: West Fork bridge and rising about
; four Inches an hour. The crest will
! be reached here between 5 and 7
;o'clock tonight, and will not exceed
; two or three feet further rise. The
I water Is not alarming here, and ut
i noon todny was hardly to the top of
; the retaining wall above the river
bridge on the Clarksburg side. This
: will be within a foot or so of tho
flood of November, 1913, and February,
1914, the last two floods of

WHITE HOUSE IS UNEASY
Latest Mexican Outbreak May
Be Vehicle for Further at tacks
in Congress.
( V AMwSiAIID Milt)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12,-Secretnry
I.aiming today telegraphed Oencrnl
farrnuzn calling Tor the prompt
punishment or tho bandits who executed
seventeen Americans near
Chthunhun Monday. Through Ellieo
Arredondo, thu newly appointed
Mexican auihassador here. It was arranged
lo bring the bodies from Chlhunhua
to Juarex today on a special
train.
Mr. Arredondo. General Carranta's
ambassador here, received the confirmation
from Carranzn sources ol[
the execution of the Americans and
has asked for further details. Hia
advices are the first confirmations
from Mexican sources.
Official despatches from Chihuahua,
to the state department said the bodies
of the seventeen Americans arrived
at that city last night.
Customs Collector Cobb at ?1 Paso
today reported that his investigation ' ;.
seemed to estnbllsh that sixteen were
' killed. The state department did not
divulge the sources of Collector
Cobb's information, but they believe,
the report Is accurate.
Collector Cobb has been aotlng as ?
1 n special agent for the state department
In Mexican altalrs, and officials
j here know that ho hns sources of In- '
formation In Mexico, upon which they i
have heretofore been unable to depend.
All other state department -'i
agents on the border were today In- ;. ' '
structed to gather all available In-,
formation on the executions and forward
It to Washington.
At the White House and at the :?
state department there was uncon
1 coaled anxiety over tbe iltuntlon and
concern that tbe latest outbreak ip
Mexlcd might oe made the vehicle
tor further attacks by tbe opposition .' $3
In Congress upon the ndmlnlstra- ivCj
tlon's foreign policy,' and its reodg-I I'
nltlon of General Carranza.
Secretary Lansing's only announcement
on the case was that tbe United . -s
States wduld look to General Carran/a
for satisfaction. Tbe question ,,'b,
i of what steps the United States will
i take depends upon development of tbe
j facts.
President AVIIson was in communl- .
cation today with Secretaries Gar'
rlson and laibslng and gave Instructions
to send to tbe White House all :z
; facts as rapidly as they were received. i-vSa
| Advices that at least sixteen Amerl;
cans were kftled were received by
; Major General Scott, chief of staff of
the army, and also by the state de'
nartment. 0
At the White Houie it was declared
that while something undoubtedly will
be done what seeps the government
will take has not been decided.
At the state department officials re
forred to the fact (hat Americana had
been warned since the United States
decided to recognise General Carranza
to leave tbe slates or Sonora and
Chihuahua, which were then regardcd
as Villa strongholds. They said'
that In spite of the offlclal warning
more than 600 Americans still remained
In the district, Wciudlng 200
Mormons at Casa Grandes.
An offlclal list of the dead reoeived
by the state department agrees with
the list contained in tbe news despatches
with the exception that It
does not contain the name of Murray
Crossett, of San Antonio. , ? . '-8
As soon as the Senate assembled jSfjt
Senator Sherman, Republican, introduced
a resolution proposing Inter- ^
veatlon in Mexico by the United
States and the six Pan-American na- "j
tlons, which have acted with It in
Mexican affairs, unless General Car- i
ranza compiles with a demand to protect
foreign Uvea and property. '/'&
Senator Galllnger Republican leader,
declared the Unlt?d States shonld t;
demand full and uulck reparation.
"There should oo conclusive notion J
taken In this matter," said he. "It |
full reparation Is not made the, gov- - /t
ernmcnt should take action necessary '3
to enforce It."
