PITTSBURGHERS AND

Musical Artists of Fame Among Prisoners;
Social Distinctions Swept Aside and
All Share Alike in British

Iyondon, Jan. 2. By mail.)
Alexandra Palace, England's single
internment camp for civilian pris
oners of war, corresponding to
Germany's Rulileben, near Berlin,
is the fascinatingly interesting Brit--h
Military City I was permitted
to visit today. No other press rep
resentatives were there; and this
Is the first time a press man has
been permitted to enter this camp.
More than 3,000 enemy aliens,
ri.li and poor from all parts of the
world, are living at Alexandra Pal
ace, mirth London. Hundreds of
Croats and Poles from Pittsburgh
and Detroit, captured on their way
home to fight; well known Euro
pean musical artists, interned hile
performing In England; Germans
and Austrians taken from ships In
the Atlantic and the North Sea and
Austro-Geiman directors of big
British firms, together with alien
inhabitants of England, some of
thirty years' residence, make a
unlfue and remarkable colony,
for the duration of the war.
There Is no social distinction In
the three battalions of a thousand
men each. Military discipline pie
Talls. It effects the English-German
aristocrat and the lowliest
Pittsburgh steel worker alike. A
company of British soldiers guards
the palace which In peace time
served as
a London Coney Island.
or White City.
There are benevolent societies,
directors' meetings, institutes of
painting, drawing, sculpture; a the
atre that would do credit to Broad
way, workshops for dozens of
trades, a fully equipped hospital;
schools, postoflces, football and
Swedish drill; laudries, mammoth
spotless kitchens, stores and shops,
commodious bath rooms and doz
ens of other things inside the barb
ed wire enclosing this multitude.
"They are making the best of It
and it is my duty to let them enjoy
life to the limit of military possi
bilities " remarked Colonel Frood
Walker, a British regular army vet
eran of twenty veara in the Orient,
who is the commandant.
The commandant's words voice
the British attitude toward prison
ers of war, both military and civil
inn. It considers the human side
of those forced to live behind wire
entanglements. Once a week the
commandant turns over his office to
prisoners who have complaints. He
hears the stories and does what
he can. The man with a grouch
tells his troubles to the captain of
his mess. If It is meritorius, the
complaint is passed to the alien
commander, another alien who gov
erns a thousand men. Then the
complainant may appear In person
before the veteran commandant,
who never "strafes" the enemy.
Twice weekly the commandant
personally Inspects every one of the
3, (too beds housed under the great
roofs of the palace. These beds
aft nent and clean, with four blan
kets and a soft mattress for earh.
There are eight cooks for every
thousand prisoners. The food is
prepared and taken to the three
great mess rooms, each' of which
can compare in floor space to the
main lobby o'f New York's Grand
Central station. Here Is the food
allowance, per man per day; 1
pounds of while bread. H pound
of meat; a pound of potatoes, two
ounces of peas, lentils, beans or
rice; two ounces of sugar, ounce
of tea or two ounces of coffee; one
it tea Of two oi
ince'of ninrgar
garine or two ounces
Each battalion has a large can
teen where a prisoner may aug
ment his food supply. The wealth
ier Internees freely patronize the
canteens, but the ordinary fare is
better than the average Pittsburgh
steel worker ever had In his life.
These Pittsburghers aren't anxious
for the war to close. They're sat
isfied. The American embassy, God
father of all enemy aliens In the
British Isles, works hand in hand
with a special committee of the
wealthier Interned men to care for
the special wants of the poor. The
women and children on the outside
are the principal beneficiaries of
this joint benevolent society. More
than 3000 cases have been attend
ed to since September.
Almost every prisoner looks for
ward eagerly to the weekly theater.
Here artists, some high in the pro
fession, perform vaudeville stunts.
Professional actors present the lat
est plays. The theater will seat
1500 persons. The scenery was
painted by artists who rank high
in British and German art circles
and Is infinitely better than that
found in the average London play
house. A smaller hall, for 500 persons,
is set aside for the evening music
als. This hall Is always crowded.
At tonight's concert Herr F. Lo
rant, an Austrian violinist, who will
be heard in America after the war,
was the star attraction. His pro
gram, much applauded, was: Teu
fel's Trllle, by TartinI; Nocturne.
C'.:opin-Sarasat; Zephyr, Hubay;
Rallad & Polonaise, Visuxtenips.
An evergreen wreath was presented
J.o Lorant by his admirers, the com
mandant doing the honor. Herr
Lino Vesco, a Hungarian grand op
era singer, reaped plaudits with
Komanza aus Don Sebastiano by
Donizetti. A piano solo. "Ballade
As Dur," by A. Reschefsky, who
studied under PaderewBkl, also was
vociferously received.
Wonderful rose gardens sur
rounding the palace are kept by
the aliens. In these gardens the
married men receive visits fro: .
their wives or friends once a month
for fifteen minutes.
Special dispensation is granted
to Interned business men. Today
a meeting of the directorate of a
big British company, both British
and German members attending,
was going on In a room provided
for the purpose. A British officer
was listening. One ( the German
directors has lived In England for
twenty years. He owns a mansion
in London, a summer home at Mar
gate, and has ten servants and an
income tin ' runs Into six figures.
On Sunday there are church ser
vices for all creeds Catholics, Lu

Coming from the north with a
whoop, a whistle and bang, the cold
wave descended on this section at 9:00
last night carrying the mercury down
in Jumps until within a few hours it
had fallen from 04 above to 2 above.
The rain which had fallen gently and
intermittently all day yesterday,
changed in a flash to sleet and frozen
snow last night and the sun arose
this morning on a glaring and barren
scene of white and frozen carpeting
The fall in the mercury last night
registered the coldest weather known
here for several years. Iast night's
drop went from a maximum of 64 de
grees shown yesterday to 2 degrees
above according to the government
thermometer. The coldest sluwn dur
iug the previous winter, was ti above
registered on December 2C, J'.il4. At
eleven o'clock this morning the sun,
battling the winds, had pushed the
thermometer readings up to seven
degrees above. ..nile weather forecasts
received over the wires stated the
drop would go to zero or colder by to
morrow mcrning.
Railway service to the northward is
more or les3 demoralized on all three
of the lines entering Chickasha. Trains
from the north over the Rock Island
are running four hours late., The
"Firefly" on the Rock Island cauie in
hours late but railway officials charge
the delay to engine trouble and state
the storm conditions were not respon
sible. The Mangum train was four
hours late out of El Reno due to a
derailment of the engine at the El
Reno roundhouse. The engine of the
Lindsay Independent acquired a bad
case of the, la grippe and refused to
pull its train out of the Chickasha
yards until eleven o'clock this morn-
Reports received at the Chickasha
station of the Santa Fe show the con
ditions on the O. C. branch of that
road to be unaffected by the storm.
However, the wires along of the Santa
Fe between Purcell and Arkansas City
are reported down and no report can
be received here of the operation of
Santa Fe fast trains from the north.
The Frisco reports "not much train
service today," The trains from the
east into Chickasha were reported one
hour and forty five minutes late this
morning with bad connections from
rthe north and other points near the
storm zone center.
The Pioneer Telephone company is
having troubles of its own along all
rural and long distance lines. All long
distance service was badly crippled
throughout the day and many of the
rural lines were practically out of
commission. Manager Kelley has put
the day in out in the country working
hard on wire trouble corrections.

BLIZZARD
BLOWS IN
BOY HIKER
Paul Ginsberg, Hoofing It from Chicago
to California, Stops in Chickasha to
Breathe Spell While Norther
Holds Sway
Paul Ginsberg, a Chicago lad of 19
years, arrived in Chickasha last night,
en route from Chicago to Universal
City, California. Paul is making the
trip a la Payson Watson style and can
tell the number of railroad ties re
quired to hold the "bands of steel"
which compass the earth between Chi
cago and Chickasha. He hopes to fin
ish this count into Universal City by
th time the blue birds fly.
Paul, tcgether with three others
started on their hike from Chicago on
November 12. The others have fallen
from the running leaving him alone
in his transcontinental marathon.
Paul carries with him a large note
book filled with clippings from news
papers published along the line of
his march He also carries with him
a knapsack weighing thirty pounds
and a thundering poor opinion of an
Oklahoma "norther."
In this connection it might be well
to state that Paul was found in a very
communicative mood this morning. In
fact he was more than willing to be
interviewed about the experiences he
had last night after the "norther" had
hit him. while he was quietly hiking
along twelve miles south of Chicka
sha hit him and smote him, hip and
thigh, and lifted him, "as on the wings
of some beautiful dove'' and carried
him with how l- of delight down the
Rock Island tracks and into the bosom
of the hospitable city of Chickasha.
Paul says he had been hitting the
grit all day yesterday, between show
ers, palpitating with heat, drowned in

perspiration and wondering just how
hot this blooming country could get
along here in the middle of Januarv.
He passed through Minco and Pocas
set as the "shades of eve were falling
fast'' and refused to stop and raSt his
head." Like the youth of years agone,
Paul longed to scale the heights ot
Chickasha during the cooling night
time's hour and shout "Excelsior" be
fore the heat of another day descended
upon him.
His wish was gratified. While yet
twelve miles on the Kansas side of
the city the wind, with a howl and a
gobble and a shout, and a wail and a
"demoniac shriek" came upon bim.
The gentle rain drops which had fallen i
all day and "soddened" his clothes,
turned in the twinkling of an eye in
to sheets of driving sleet and the
winds changed quicker than thought
into a seventy miles per hour gale or
thereabout. These winds, with kitten
ish playfulness lifted Paul from the
earth and bore him away on their
snow "downy wings."
And thus it was, hitting the grit
only on the high places, his hair and
clothing and face encrusted with iclc
les and bediamoned with frozen snow
flakes, that Paul arrived, with the
chiming of the time of 9:30, last even
ing in Chickashaand yelled for a fire.
He is going to camp right here until
the breezes again blow from the south.
"Where am I going?" re peating the
question, Paul asked. "Well. I had
Intended going to Amarillo, but from
what I've heard of the 'northers' down
there I guess nit. I'll wait here for
the coming of the relief and then
walk into Fort Worth and drop over
to Dallas and get my orders there,
guess I'll go' from Dallas straight to
El Paso, take a peep across the border
into the land of Villa's dreams and
hit it up into California to Universal
City. Say, on the level, how cold does
it get down here in this 'land of flow
ers?' "
