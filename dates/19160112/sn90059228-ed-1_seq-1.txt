Buff Papers to be Fashionable
The first local indication of the
color shortage will be noticed this
week by readers of the Sheaf in the
shade of the paper used. This is a
statural or yellowish tint which shows
the absence of the blues necessary to
ve the sheet the white color with
which the reader is so familiar. This
action on the part of the Sheaf is not
one of choice, the fact being that the
mill the Sheaf gets its paper from
is out of coloring matter or is sav
ing whatever they may have.
Now that necessity has again given
us what resembles the straw paper
of other days, the public had better
pretend that it likes the change, as
it will do no good to protest. Soon,
we fear, all the newspapers and

and become in fact yellow journals.

WHYGASOIINESUP BY BART
Will Marshall County farmers get
their full share of the $5,000.00
worth of premiums that are to be
offered at the Fifth Annual Farm
Crops Show to be held at Crookston
the week of Feb. 7th to 12th
elusive? This depends solely
whether the farmers of this county
get busy right now with their ex
hibits. Remember that it will not
take as good corn exhibits this year
to walk off with the bacon as it did
last year. Every county failed to
make the corn showing made last,
year, and if you have some fairly
good corn, select the best carefully
and enter it. With the grain there
should be a wonderful showing this
year, and there will be some splen
did prizes offered. See to it that
Marshall County gets its full quota
of blue ribbons, and the only way to
do this is for every farmer to get
into the game. If the farmers are
not interested, let them suggest it
to their sons, and help them to
make the selections of wheat, oats,
corn, barley, rye, flax, etc, and get
into the game as progressive farm
ers. It will make better farmers
of them and spur them on to great
er efforts next year. They have not
only the big association premiums to
strive for, but the county prizes as
well.
Another thing, plan on coming for
the entire week, or if that is im
possible, let some of the family at
tend each day. The Farm Crops
Show is the great annual Clearing
House for the best farmers in the
Great -Minnesota Red River Valley.
Leading farmers will be heard, and
Stock* Raisers, Poultrymen, and
farmers who diversify will be pres
ent, as well as many of the leading
speakers of the country, who will
not only give you food for thought
after you go home, but entertain
you. Attend this big annual event
and add your influence toward mak
ing Jhe Minnesota Red River Valley
the most prosperous and most pro
gressive agriculture empire in the
world.

Suddenly Summoned By Death.
Charles Russell Wood died sudden
ly at his home in town of Bristlet,
at 6 o'clock on Saturday morning,
Jan. 8,1916, the cause of death being
apoplexy.
Deceased had been in his usual
health up to the time that he receiv
ed the fatal stroke. On the evening
before he had brought his daughter,
Ruth, home from Warren, where she
is attending school, and appeared to
be in a happy, jovial frame of mind
just as he always was. But He who
holds the lives of all humans in the
hollow of his hand had in his wisdom
decreed to call this servant from the
toil and cares of this world to Hi*1
eternal rest.
Deceased was born at Waldron
111., on April 9, 1860, hence his agt
was 55 years and some months a4"
the time of death. In the state of
Illinois he grew up, married, reared
a family and followed the occupation
of farming until in the spring of
1906, when he and family mo/ed to
Minnesota, settling on a fa*m that
had been purchased a few miles
south of Warren. Since com ng 1
deceased has become known as i
successful and progressive farmer,
and a good neighbor and citizen, who
was alweys willing to do his share,
and more than his share, for the up
building of the new community. He
was genial and cheerful and always
ready to lend a helping hand to those
needing assistance in one way or
another.
Decesed is mourned immediately
by the wife who survives him and
the following children: Fred
Wood, of Herscher, 111. Arthur L.
Wood, who lives on a farm of his
own adjoining the father's and Ro
bert A., Mildred Ruth, and Russell
Charles, who stay at home. Many
relatives and friends also mourn a
good man's departure.
Mr. Wood had always affiliated
with the M. E. church, and in the M.
E. church in this city the funeral was
conducted on Tuesday, Jan. 11, at 2
m. Appropriate songs were sung
and an impressive discourse was
preached by Rev. Bartholow. Mem
bers of the M. W. A. lodge of which
deceaced was a member, and neigh
bors and friend from the country
around the city, filled the church
to overflowing. The floral tributes
were very beautiful, including several
set pieces. The son from Illinois had
come here to join the other members
at the bier of the departed father.
After the service in the church a
large procession of mourners escort
ed the remains to Greenwood ceme
tery, where they will rest until the
morn of resurrection. Peace to the
memory of a good man and useful
citizen. To all who mourn this com
munity extends its most heartfelt
sympathy.
