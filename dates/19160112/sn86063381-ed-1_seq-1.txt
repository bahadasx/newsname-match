Although ,g*rlad only in one
piece jumper suits, and with
out shoes, hats, coats or

two big tents and a wagon.
There are stoves in the tents
and the floor is covered with
straw. George, one of the boys
was asked if he was cold.
"Cold?" he repeated,
watching his toes tamp the
snow, "Naw!" And he wig
gled 'em to prove it.

CONGRESS TO DEMAND
AN INVESTIGATION
Senator Sherman Demands That
Armed Troops Be Sent Into
Mexico.
El Paso, Tex., Jan. 12.Seventeen
persons, all believed to have been
Americans, were killed by Mexican
bandits Monday night after being
taken from a Mexican Northwestern
train fifty miles west of Chihuahua,
robbed and stripped of their clothing,
according to a report received here
last night.
Thomas M. Holmes, the only known
survivor, stated that he counted but
sixteen Americans taken from the
train.
According to brief messages re
ceived here, the train bearing the
Americans was stopped by the ban
dits 50 miles west of Chihuahua City.
The men were taken from the train,
robbed, stripped nude and lined up
along the cars for execution. Holmes,
it is said, was on the extreme end of
the line. As the firing squad, de
tailed by the bandit leader took po
sition, it is reported, Holmes broke
away and fled into the desert for his
life. With feet and body cut and
bleeding from the stones and sharp
cactus, he ran without looking back
until he no longer heard the whistle
of bullets past him or the sound of
fighting.
He succeeded in reaching friendly
Mexicans, it is reported, and was
aided back to Chihuahua City.
Washington, Jan. 12.Senator
Sherman of Illinois introduced a reso
