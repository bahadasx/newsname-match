for the moment the Russians have
ceased their attack upon the Austro
Oerman lines, from the Pripet river
to the llessurablnn frontier, informa
tion from German sources is that
they have not given up the venture
but are merely reorganizing their
forces for another formidable as

So far ns the western front Is con

tho Champagne region. According
to French accounts there was clear
ly nothing casual or ordinary about
the big German attack which the
French claimed they successfully
stopped. The French linos here make
a tempting salient but the position
evidently has been made correspond-

Paris claims that the French by
vigorous counter-attacks expelled the
Germans from all except a small sec

The Irish nationalists today an -
nouiiced abandonment of their oppo
sition in view of the fact that the bill
does not apply to Ireland. John
Itidnionil, the veteran home rule
leader, who made this announcement,
shaied the most prominent position
in the day's debate with his own ene
my, Sir Fdward (.'arson, who, in
fiery speech, pleaded that Ireland
ought to be included in the bill. Sir
Kdward rose to speak as soon as Mr.
Redmond ceased.
Wants Ireland Included.
"I welcome the announcement
which has Just been made," he said,
referring t,, Mr. lieiimond's with
drawal of the Irish nationalist oppo
sition, "but I regret that the honor
able gentleman should not have gone
a step farther and led his party into
tin- house in favor of the bill. It
would have been even better If the
honorable gentleman had allowed
Ireland to be included. He and I
are old opponents, but J can assure
him from the bottom of my heart
that nothing would be more likely to
bring us together on u common plat
form than that we should find Ire
land, together with Kngland, Scotland
und Wales, absolutely unanimous in
what we believed necessary lor win
ning the war.
Disappoint, il oy t.oiei nun ui. i
"I am profoundly disappointed!
with the way the coalition govern-j
ment has dealt with the matter of!
Ireland. Is Ireland lees concerned'
with the result of the war than Great
Britain? You may go on making
sacrifices and we will be prepared to
rejoice in and share the result, Av
an Irishman, I say that Ireland should
be niihamed to bo open to such re
proach. "Has Ireland done better than
Great Britain in recruiting? She ha;i
not done half as well, and It is great
mistake to go on buttering her up,
tolling her she has done splendidly,
when she has not.
"I make one more appeal to Mr.
Itndmond. It is that he considers
whether Ireland can not even now bo
included in the bill,
I'rwIlt-tM leellnjr of Slinine.
"In my heart I believe that when
the hour of victory comes, ns it cer
tainly will come, we who are Irish
men will foci the deepest shame to
remember Hint we expected others to
make sacrifices from which we pro
vided our own exclusion."
Reviewing the history of the war,
.Sir Kdward Carson declared that lack
of men had been the chief reason for
the failure in the Dardanelles and
the Serbian expedition,
i "Tile fiiet is." he urged, "we run
not win the wui without this bill
lie declared that the opponents of
compulsion had failed to realize the
difficulties with which the allies al"
faced. Turning toward the labor I
benches, he said:
Nothing Should Escape.
''.Somebody has remarked that this
bill s likely to lead to an Industrial I
conscription of wealth. 1 suy if In-'

to me if 1 have to luing my head in
eternal shame because my country
bus been beafea ."'
Augusliii Hlriell, the Irish secre
tary, replying to Sir Edward Curson,
said:
Not pplicflldo to Ireland.
"The government never contem
plated the iipplieation of th- bill
Ireland. Tor they could not hope
establish in Ireland those uppcul
In, iialy wherein the success of the
tri

bus done wonderfully, well, but I say
'do not nifh her.'
"Irish loyal!) Is a plant thai has
to be well Waleled, Well nurtured,
never pulled up by the roots. If,
before the war, anyone had lob! me

already done, I would have stared at
hiin In wild surprise, and whispered, i
'You don't Know what you are talk
tin; about '
' Who, remembering Irish history,
('ares say Ireland lias not done amaz
ingly well'.'"
The chief speaker ngaiusi the bill
today ;n William Crawford Ander
son, labor member of Sheffield. He
is w widely known labor leader, the
son of a blacksmith mid the organiz
er of the powerful Shop Assistants'
union. The effect of his speech,
however, wns largely discounted by
the fact that he was promptly disa
vowed as th" representative of the
labor party by Will Thome, founder
of the Gas Workers' union.

Ml. Anderson said he represented
the majority opinion of the labor con.
gl'iss which he believed truly reflect

of the country.
"Moreover," he added, "the pre
judice of the working people against
conscription will harden as time goes
by. 1 warn you that the government
Is heading straight toward dWasler if
it attempts to apply the principles ot
this bill.
"If the bill passes, then God help
the working people when they come
