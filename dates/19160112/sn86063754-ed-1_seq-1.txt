American Lives Lost
"Washington, Jan. 7.?Two
communications from Germany
reached the United States today
?one containing a proposal to
pay an indemnity for the Americans
lost in the Lusitania disaster,
which may brine negotiations
on that subject to a conclusion
and the other conveying
assurances that German submarine
commanders operating
in the Mediterranean would not
torpedo noncombatant ships Jof
any charactet without warning

their passengers and crews.
The communications w ere delivered
to Secretary Lansing by
Count von Bernstorff, the German
Ambassador. The Secretary
immediately sent them to
President Wilson.

considered that America and
Germany at last were near a
final agreement regarding the
conduct of submarine warfare.

attitude Germany apparently
has assumed. It is considered
to be virtually in harmony with
the American viewpoint.
Tension regarding: the entire
submarine question seemed to
have lessened considerably.

thereby is involved. It is con

sunk as an act of reprizal for the
British blockade of Germany.
While Secretary Lansing is
understood not to have indicated
to Count von Bernstorlt
whether the proposal was satis
factory, a number of otficials in
a position to be familiar with
the American attitude indicated
that it would be ac epted.
The assurances regarding the
conduct of submarine warfare
in the Mediterranean obviously
prompted by the sinking of the
British steamship Persia with
a loss of two American lives, are
much broader in their scope
than the promises made after
the Lusitania disaster covering
the operations of submarines in
the North Sea and adjacent
waters. .The latter guaranteed
only that ,4hners" should be
immune from attack without
warning. The assurances renrnr/linnr

country Mott Prosperous Ever
Washington, Jan. 7?Secretary
of Commerce Redfield, in
a memorandum on business
conditions transmitted to President
Wilson today, pictures the
country as in the most prosperous
state of its history. The
warning is added, though, that
war's inflation of commerce will
last only until war's end, and
that business foresight alone will
prepare the United States for
peace. ?
The slump that will follow
the war abroad, the summary
declares, must find Americans
ready to take thefr share of the
world's trade unhampered by
provincial notions. False valdes

How Cain Built a Town
Gaffney Ledger.
When Cam liad killed off onefourth
of the people on the
earth?leaving only three, then
went into the land of Nod and
huilded a city, it is evident that
he did not sit around like a lump
on a log, and growl about the
Nod real estate and people. He
was not himself, perhaps, the
most exemplary of men, and if
he had some reason to emigrate
from the land of his birth, he
did not mope and whine, but
got hold of a piece of ground
and went to work to do something.
The man who could,
build up a city under such aus
pices is the kind of material we
want in Gaffney; and we will
not inntiiro tnn minniolw >? ?

antecedents, so that he takes
hold like a man and be good at
last.
But what is more, Cain did
not advise his son to "go west,
and get out of the old dead
town." He named the city after
him, believed in it, worked for
it, brought his goods there and
kept his money at home. Does
anybody suppose that when
strangers came to Enoch, (name
of the city) with any notion of
going into business there, Cain
told them it was a "dead old
town," that it was established by
a murderer. that iho tuato* ?a?
??w ftuv fvai^i nrao
bad; its merchants all sharks,
and its mechanics botches?that
the town was not healthy and
would "never amount to anything
no how." Does anybody
suppose that when he wanted
to invest a few dollars in dry
goods he hustled off to the city,
or that he only went to the mejjL
chants of "Enoclie^when Wt
Wanted a favor?wanted "alitwjfl
time?"
Do you think he ever went

that could be had at better rates
in "Enoch** than elsewhere, or
to Cincinnati for cheap buggies
when the "home manufacturer*'
could meet every demand with
more stylish and substantial
rigs?
Do you suppose he went moping
around about taxes being too
high in Enoch and no one there
knowing anything about busi ,
ness? No, sir. He evidently
wasn't built that way. If taxes
were high, he got up and hustled
to increase the value of ,
property, so that there would be
greater values to tax. He built
houses and encouraged others to
do so. If city lots got too low
he bought up a dozen or two,
scattered here and there, for the ,
double purpose of personal
profit and strengthening values.
On these he put up plenty of
bouses at reasonable figures,
good ones, too, so that when any
one came to Enoch he did not
have to move into an old tumble- ,
down shanty or move on. He
improved and beautified every
lot, kept the weeds down and
set out trees on the lots and in
front of them, even where he
did not build, thus adding to the
value of each lot and adjoining
property as well. He found
that it did not take so much
money to run a comely, well
keot town as it Hid n dMlonida*
ed, God forsaken one, and there
were four times the values on j
which to raise the required
money. That's the wav he
lowered taxation, not by sitting
on a stump and howling about
it. If a man wanted to i nn a
factory, or some other enter{irise,
he was not afraid the felow

Manna Says Commisioners Cannot
Lawfully Pay Accountant.
Several months ago the grand
jury of Chesterfield county employed
Mr. J. S. Bishop, an ex
pert accountant who was former
auditor of tne C&L road, to
check up the books of the county
officers. Mr. Bishop has nearly
completed the work and will
make his final report to the
grand jury in February.
His claim for $1,183 has been filed,
and seven hundred of it was
paid the first Monday in January
There are those who dispute
the right of the board of county
commissioners to pay for this
wprk out of the ordinary county
funds. Lawyer R. E. Hanna in
writing the Chesterfield Advertiser.
says: I have been requested
to make public my views of
the law in regard to the accountant
now employed in checking
the books of the County officials.
First I wish to cite section
4034 of Volume 1 Code of 1912
in full:
"Grand Jury May Employ Expert
Accountant. Grand juries
may, whenever in their judg
ment it becomes necessary, employ
one oi more expert ac
countants to aid them to examine
and investigate the offices,
books, papers, vouchers and accounts
of any public officer of
their respective counties and to
fix the amount of compensation
or per diem to be paid therefore,
upon the approval of the presiding
judge, given before any expert
is employed."
JLJnder this section it will be
geHAbflt a necessary orcreaui
approval of the prebefore

such powers
to paBSRpon claims as given by
section 945 which section is as
to accounts etc in the roads,
bridges, ferries; 970 which lays
down specifically the only items
that are to be paid by the county
ana unless tms accountant under
the provision of this section
comes in as a juror there is no
provision made for the payment
and therefore the statute tails.

Lucky for mere man that our

that "for every year known as
Leap Year every maiden ladv of
both high and low estate shall
have the liberty to bespeak the
man she likes; and should he refuse
to take her to be his lawful
wife he shall be fined in a sum
of pounds more or less as his estate
