PEKING, Jan. 12. Twenty Ameri

shipped from the United States to the
Russian, government. Both the Bald
win company and the American Loco
motive works have experts here, as
sisting the Russians in their efforts
to get adequate locomotive power for
the Trans-Siberian railway.
The locomotives coming from Ameri
ca are unloaded at Vladivostok. They
are knocked down into as small pieces
as possible, and boxed in America for
shipment. Upon their arrival at
Vladivostok, the engines are rushed
on to Harbin, where the facilities for
erecting them are better than at Vladi
vostok. Because of the slides In the Pana
ma canal, the delivery of the locomo
tives was much delnyed. It requires
several weeks to erect an engine, and
the first of the American engines to
reach Siberia will be put Into commis
sion this week.
All told four hundred and fifty loco
motives have been sold by American
manufacturers to the Russian govern
