With Impotent Rage Senate Resolution Demands Armed
Intervention in Mexico.
El Paco, Texas, Jan. 12. In
afternoon awaited arrival of
bodies of 16 Americans and
by Mexicans in Chihuahua Monday.
Apparently nothing has been done by either Zack Cobb,
lepresenting the state department, nor General Garcia,
Carranzista commander at Juarez, toward avenging the
cold blooded massacre of this party of mining men of the
Cusihuiriachio Mining company. On every hand, there
was denunciation of the slaying and a spirit of bitterness
toward the Wilson administration, which had found ex
pression in sharp protests to Washington.
The fact that General Villa and 15 men were at La Junta
two days ago, within 15 miles of the spot where the Amer
icans were dragged from a
and shot one by one, strengthened the belief that Villa
himself was in personal command of the bandits. General
Rodriguez and other bandits were not in the immediate
vicinity, it is known.
Arrangements were made here today to admit the
corpses of the bandit victims without the formality of red
tape at the border line. J. F. Ryan, representing the
"Cusi" company chartered a special train to bear them
here, and this is slated to arrive late tonight.
Leading mining men wired at least 100 protests to
Washington today, demanding immediate action to safe
guard effectively Americans in Mexico. Most of them were
addressed to Senator Fall, of
the administration Mexican

Further-details than tlio bloody stor-e-t
already confirmed were unobtain
able today, because of ' strict censor
ship. An unconfirmed report said tiiat
Oeneral Trcvino, Carranzista, had sent
an expedition to the scene to pursue
tlio bandits, but as the latter havo n
two .jlnys st lit, it is believed they are
fcnfo in the mountain! with the loot
they obtained in their holdup of the
mining men's train.
The report that Villa led the Ameri
cans slayers seemed to have substanta
tion from tiio fact that he is known to
have harbored an extremely bitter hat
red of Americans ever since the Car
rnnza government was recognized.
Authorities here think that ho has
merely bided his time for an opportun
ity such as that Monday in which to
whit thirst for rcvongo against the
United States, and his desire, at the

ment for failing to protect Americans.

Survivor Tells Story.
Shot down as they attempted to es
cape, 10 Americans massacred by Vil
lista bandits in Chihuahua Monday,
were given no chance for their lives,
according to the stntement of T. It.
Holmes, sole survivor, who arrived
hero today. Holmes escaped a similar
fate through tho ruse of stumbling and
falling over a railroad tie, worn out
and apparently dead from tho effects
or the experience. The . tragedy has
shaken his nerves, and ho told a brok
en story.
"At 2 o'clock Monday afternoon,..'
iio said, "our special was stopped near
La Visa by a derailment ahead.
"I was sitting with Tom Kvnus and
he said: 'Let's get out and see what's
the matter.'
"He nnd I started out of the car,
and Watson and another joined us. We
were not expecting anything, and wo
merely went out to get' tho air.
"As T jumped to the ground, a group
of Mexicans opened fire on us. Kvnns
was hit by tho first volley nnd fell.
Watson started up the embankment
while the Mexicans kept shooting nt
him. Hull fled in another direction.
"Then the Mexicans began shooting
nt me and 1 ran alongside tho car with
tho bullets striking All nround me. 1
stumbled over n tie. Thev evideutlv
thought I was killed, so I didn't rise.'"'
"I lay there n few minutes until the
shooting at my three eomnnnions end
ed, but tho Mexicans began shooting
through the windows nt the otherB in
side. Home of tho boys rushed to the
doors and 1 supposed they were slaught
ered "Then I began to ernwl along the
ground as tho Mexicans wereu't pay
ing nny attention to me. When 1 got
ont of their view, I crept on my lunula
and knees to an open place ami ran at
fast as I could.
"Xenr Kanla Ysnbel, I hid in a Mex
ican ranch house, I gave x man there
soma money to tnka care of me, and ho
fixed tho cut nnd bruises thut I re
ceived in escaping. At night the ranch
man drove me toward Chihuahua, and T
reached thore at 7 o'clock Tuesday
morning.
"I learned inter that Watson and
Anderson were only wounded in the
first shooting and wero later given the
'tiro de graeia' or mercy shot. The
Mexicnns shot them through the head,
practically blowing off their heads...'
Holmes, who was accompanied here
by ids wife, has no Idea who command

AMERICANS SLAIN
BY VILLA
WHOCAPTURETRAIN
El Paso, Texas, Jan. 12. The worst
massacre of peaceful Americans in the
history of Mexico was dotailed in of
ficial messages received today telling
bow 1(1 United Htatcs citizens and two
citizens of Great Britain wero dragged
from a Mexican Northwestern train
Mondny, robbed of thoir $2.1,000 pay
roll, stripped off their clothing and
shot in cold blood.
Direct orders from General Francis
co Villa to his subordinates to kill ev
ery American or other foreigner they
met caused tho slaughter, today's ad
vices showed. That Villa personally
commanded tho firing squad which
slew the unfortunate victims one by
one wns reported in somo quarters.
When tho Americans wero captured,
tho VillistnB at first began to shoot
them one nt a time. Hoeing that death
was inevitable, several of tho unfor
tnnates attempted to make a run for
it nnd wero shot down as they ran. Thu
shrieks of tho men ns they were mur
dered wero heard by Thomas Holmes,
another American pnsscngor on the
train, who scaped toe vengeance of the
Mexicans by hiding in tho toilet room
of ono of the conches. Later he suc
ceeded In escaping to Chihuahua and
bringing tho fir.st news of the mas
sacre.
The probability that the murders
would never bo revenged aroused the
border to fever heat. In fact, the
slowness of Currnnzistn officials to
take sympathetic action resulted in a
mnss meeting of mine ownerB and oth
ers here last night nt which the dele
gates denounced tho Washington ad
ministration's Mcxicnn policy.
Lured back to work by passports
granted by tho Washington govern
ment', and through the Cnrrnnza admin
istration's guarantees of protection the
miners wore refused nn escort of 100
Carranzista soldiers, though if Gener
al Jacinto Trcvino of Chihuahua had
granted this, tho party would have
been saved.
Confirmation of tho mnssncrcs came
in mesHOgcs from British Vico Consul
Kcobol at Chihuahua to H. C, Mylcs,
liritisn diplomatic agent hero.
Fifteen bandits stopped lhe train at
Santa Ysnbel. Jn tho party on board
were officials nnd employes of the
Cusi Mining company of which Pot
ter Piilmcr, of Chicago, is president.
They wero going to re open the com
pany's rich silver mines at Cusihuria
chie. Tho bandits attired themselves
in the Americans' clothing and then
marched their victims to a ravine close
to the track and shot them in cold
blood.
Each of inn Americans had to wiit
his turn; none but Holmes escaped. The
norror or tneir last moment may never
be known.

And they mean employment of a small
