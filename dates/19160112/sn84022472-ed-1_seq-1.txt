RECOUNTS MURDER

Providence. , R. I., Jan. 1 2 Miss
Emily G. Burger, secretary , to Dr. O.
Franklin Mohr, and jealousy of whom
the state alleges, was a contributing
motive for the murder of the phy
sician at the instigation, of his wife,
was called td the stand by the prose
cution today. ' .
V The testimony of this witness .lifted
the trial - of Mrs. Mohr and her two
alleged negro accomplices, Cecil V.
Brown and Henry H. Spellman, out of
the ordinary. It was . the first time
that : she told her version of the
tragedy and her 'testimony quickened
the interests of the spectators.
; Miss Burger, in her confidential ca
pacity, is supposed to know -more of
the private business affairs of her em
ployer and the medical practice that
brought him wealth .and notoriety
than anyone else. Intimations .by the
defense -that the record of "the dead
man as a physician would be gone into
has accounted largely for the interest
in the case. Miss' Burger, led by the
prosecuting attorney, told of the auto
mobile ride with the doctor -which
ended in Ahe fatal wounding of her
companion and serious wouiids to herself-.
' , . o
"I was in theyrear "seat !of tnfe au
tomobile" with th doctor," she said.
"Healls," (the chauffeur who'- has
turned state's evidence), 'stopped the
car, turned off-the-headlights, put on
the side lights and then . got out. ; lie
said , something about - motor trouble.
Then I Jieard an explosion and I real
ized that I. had been shof." ; - .
At the dame time, she sald.vtha
doctor- leaned toward her and sh'
heard Healis say, ""Oh! My fcfod!" .
," Duriiig tfaev..cross-examinatloB the
state sought to keep out testimony
explaining th witness' presence in
the - automobile but the- court - ruled
that the testimony, was permissible...
- Miss Burger admitted that she was
& close friend of Dr. 'Mohr and tht
he "had visited her at her home almost
every day during the five' years pre
ceding his death. ' She said that she
had a black eye on the night of the
murder but-could not account for-it.
fche- was unable' to- recall many JhapT
penlngs of that night because of h-er
weakened condition, . .Shl remember
ed that Healis assisted her'tft Ahe side
of 'the oad after the shooting. ' Her
recovery took some time and even
today she was not. strong. i.',
, Miss Burger appeared self-possessed
and promptly lifted her-veil, at th
request of attorneys for the jdefense.
Mrs. Mohr hung on every word 'of the
witness." As Miss Burger-;, entered
the room the accused Voman.for the
first time lost all color." leaning for
ward in her chair she kept her gaze
fixed . on t the witness. .Earlier wit
