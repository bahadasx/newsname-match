Attended by Members
-PRESIDENT REVIEWS PAST YEAS
Matter of Ariens Manufacturing Co.
Comes up for Considerable Dis
cussion—Club to Co-Operate
The first annual business meeting
)f the Denison Commercial club was
teld at the club rooms Friday evening
jf last week and the usual amount of
business in connection with the clos
ing of tno 'ear previous was disposed
tf. The attendance at the meeting
Ivas vory good and all of the members
took an active interest in the election
officers and business matters that
•ame up before them.
Mr. J. B. Lyon was re-elected to the
fflee of president of the club'by an
overwhelming majority, which- was a
learty endorsement by the members
if the manner in which he has
handled the affairs for the past year.
p#r. Hugo Gebert .was elected to the
(cilice of vice president and Mr. J. T.
Haugh was re-elected treasurer, as
was Mr. Roy E. Mote *re-elec ted to the
office'of secretary.. Considerable spirit
was shown in the voting for the two
directors to fill the vacancies by B.
J. Sibbert and W. W. Ferguson. Af
ter several ballots had been taken J.
T. Carey aYid Leon Powers were elect
ed to places on the board of directors.
Mr. J. B. Lyori prepared a review
of the affairs of the club during the
time he has held the office of presi
dent. the paper being read by Secre
tary Mote. President Lyon's review
was as follows:
Gentlemen of the Denison Commer
cial Club:
"While the past year has not re
sulted in the club accomplishing any
thing particularly unusual it has not
(been idle. When your president as
sumed his office a year ago he lay con
isiderable emphasis on the fact that
[the club should demand that the city
(council should get busy immediately
to prepare for paving, and while the
Iclub does not wish to take any undue
credit, we feel that the preliminary
?tepa. that have been taken to prepare
the city for ^paving this year are larger
ly due to the efforts put forth by the
committee, appointed from this club.
In addition to the "five-light electro
liers which were installed last year
throughout the business portion of
the city, we have caused to be install
ed this yen- single light poles running
to the different depots, which makes
a decided improvement in the appear
ance of the streets as well as making
it safer for pedestrians and traveling
generally. We have this year, as
previously, taken charge of the street
sprinkling and have given its .patrons
I the same .splendid, faultless service
Ithat we have in the past, as well as
leaving a balance in the hands of the
committee.
"In response to the offer of the Lin
'coin Highway commission to furnish
.content to build a mile of cement road,
vour president appointed a committee
to confer with the county board and
to solicit funds to defray the expense
(of building the mile. This committee
has met with reasonably good success
ami will make a report on the progress
they have made. The club has lent
both its moral and financial aid to
many deserving projects during the
year, among others was to vote $100
toward reducing the debt that has
A Sale on White

Will Break All Pre
vious Records
There are 150 middy blouses to be
cftered for our January White Sale at

dren's and misses' blouses.
been hanging like a pall over our at!i
letic field.
"Your president was authorized in
July to name a cleanup week for Den
ison, at which time the citizens were
requested to cut the weeds, remove
rubbish and all unsightly material
from their premises and from alleys
adjacent to same, but. in spite of all
appeals the request was disregarded
and the weeds continued to grow rank
er and the stench in the alleys grew
stronger and .rose higher.
"We all view with pride the steady
development of our city, but there is
one great obstacle which is retarding'
its growth. While we encourage peo
ple to make this city their home, the
lack of residences makes it impos
sible. While there has been some ef
fort made by some of'our enterprising
citizens to provide living places lor
some, the supply of houses still Is far
short of the demand, which precludes
the possibility of our town growing
until this condition is improved. Thera
are in existence several ^building and
loan companies in some of our neigh
boring cities that operate locally, and
which have built scores oC homes lor
people of limited means!, and I think
the civic committee of this club should
investigate the systems and if feas
ible urge the inauguration of somo
such plan to relieve the present con
dition.
"I am still harping about the brick
yard. It is indeed deplorable that with
clay that is equal to any clay in this
part of the country tills plant should
be entirely abandoned and allowed to
sink into innocous disitude. With tho
amount of building which our city is
yearly enjoying it would alone gfre
the enterprise enough work to keep it
reasonably busy, while the added bus
iness from abroad would make it a
paying proposition. This also tho club
should get behind and try to put it on
its foot.
"I do not wish to be complaining,
but your president was ^disappointed
in the directors not taking a greater
interest in the duties attached to their
office. In spite of repeated solicita
tions and frequent urging there has
not been a meeting of the board of di
rectors during the entire year, and I
am going to ask in the name of fair
play to treat my successor, whoever
he may be. with a greater degree of
consideration.
"I wish again to call the attention
of the members as to the real object
of this club. Its principal object is
to work for the interest of Denison,
and the country adjacent thereto, and
while I fully believe that tire social
features should not be allowed to !ax,
let us not forget its real object. Busi
ness and business first.
"I wish to thank the members
collectively for ftaving had the honor
to serve as your president during the
past year and if I have not'-come up
to your expectations. I /can truthfully
say that I have tried t3 give the best
which my ability afforded."
Four new members were taken in
at the meeting, namely: N. N. Nor
man, R. Wygant, Leo Collins and C.
S. Trimble. R. E. Mote, the secretary,
made a very comprehensive report,
showing the condition of the club for
the year just ending, which was ac
cepted by the club. The report of
the treasurer, Mr. J. T. Haugli, was
read and showed a balance on hand
of $232.43. The club voted to donate
$22.00 to pay the balance due on the
municipal tree and the secretary was
authorized to draw a warrant for the
same and turn it over to Mrs. N. L.
Hunt, who was chairman of the com
mittee that had 4he municipal tree in
charge.
One of the important matters con
eidered by the club at its annual meet-

Crawford cpunty is experiencing
real blizzard today, the first so far
thig winter. Snow' fell nearly ail day
yesterday and this morning the cold
blast from the north sent the mercury
in the thermometers down to 10 de

Sunday, and since that time the tora
perature has been rising and falling
until today, when it lias registered
the lowest so far this winter.
Iowa is not the only state suffering
from extreme cold for the north west
ern states and Canada are reporting
extremely cold weather. The lowest
temperature reported is 48 degrees be
lo\V zero at Battleford. Sask., Canada.
On tho Minnesota iron range the tem
perature varied from 10 to 20 below.
In Minneapolis it was 20 below. The
transcontinental railroads are expe
riencing great difficulty in resuhiing
traffic across the Sierras. For over
twenty-four hours Southern Pacific
ami Western Pacific railroads were
tied tip and at-some points in the
mountains they report 12 feet of snow:

So great is the contrast between our
present war order prosperity and jlie
deplorable depression in which wo
labored pi'or to the outbreak of the
war, that most of us forget 1912. and
compare our present business^status
with 1913 and 1914. We rejoice that
Christmas business was better tlm
season Iran last. Still, if bank-clear
ings are any indication, our prosper
ity is still "spotted" as compared with
1912. Reports from seven of the lead
ing citics show that New York and
Philadelphia are tho only ones of the
seven that report bank clearings as
large for the week ending Dec. 25, 1915
as for the corresponding week in 1912.
Many cities' aro adopting battle
cries as business "boosters," For
some of our neighbors "bottle cries"
would be more appropriate.

CARRIERS AFTER OLD JOBS.
Old Rural Route Carriers Make Appli
cation to Post Office Department
for Reappointment.
Postmaster Alfred Wright received
a letter Saturday from the post office
department at Washington. D. C.. pon
firuiing the telegram received the
week before stating that the old rural
routes out of Denisoiy'would be re
established. and that the motor routes
would be discontinued.
The post office department advised
Postmaster Wright that old rural
route carriers who wished to remain
in tho service could make application
to the department. Postmaster Wright
tells us that all of the old carriers
I have made1 application for their for*
[mer routes and no doubt they will he
restored to the service without having
I to take another examination.
This action by the post office depart
ment will no doubt settle tho muddle
followed the establishment of
the fifty mile motor routes. Crawford
was not. the only county in the state
that suffered under the new arrange
ment and there was a great demor.stra-!
tion in all parts of the state over tlfel
crippling of the rural route service.
Aftor giving the motor routes a trial
it was demonstrated to the depart
ment that patrons on fifty mile routes
could not be served by carriers in ina
cliines during the fall and winter
months. The: democratic party made
few friends by attempting to reduce
the expenses of the post oflice depart
ment at the expense of the farmers
Iowa and it did not ta«e them long to
see that a mistake had been made.
FIRST SHIPMENT OF SEER HERE.
American Express Company Received
First Consignment of Beer. Sat

The American Express company re
ceived their first consignment of beer
since the closing of the saloons in ilie
state on Saturday of last week. The

ped from Albert -tea# Minn., to ah in
dividual here in Denison. Since the
closing of the saloons the local1 ex
press office ha? delivered four con
signments of whiskey to parties in
Denison.and immediate vicinity. No
doubt the shipments will increase af
ter the supply which was laid in by
those who enjoy their glass of liquor
has been'depleted.
For several^weeks Crawford count*
liastbeen flooded with d*euIar JeU&c*
and catalogues from mail order liquor
concerns who ate going after the bus
iness in Iowa. The railroad compan
ies are. already handling many ship
ments of liquor and it is expected that
they will do a big business in this lid©
from now on.
The prohibition people are now agi
tating cutting, off the shipments of
liquor into the' state q'f Iowa from wet
states and already a suit has been
commenced against the American Ex

Here for Several Years With His
Erother-ir.-Law, Mr. E. Gulick
News of the deatli of Cornelius S.
Curtis, which occurred at his home at
Wausau, Wis., late la3t Wednesday
night, was received in Denison Thurs
day morning by his brother-in-law, Mr.
K. Gulick, and caused great suit,rise
to the older residents of the city who
were acquainted with Mr. Custis when
he was engaged i'n the implement bus
iness here with JVIr. Gulick from 187t!
to 1882 on ilie site now occupied by
i.io Stewart Lumber company's yards
just, west of the Review building. Mr.
ant] Mrs. K. Gulick and Mr. and Mrs.
C. h. Voss departed Thursday after-
Corne.iui -j. Curlis
noon for Wausau to be in attendance
at the funeral, which was held from
the family residence at Wausau Sat
urday afternoon.
We are. printing an articla oh the
MP
tor lie had thousands of since-e
friends.
Cornelius S. Curtis was a type of the
Furoessful business man who, by his
own efforts, had risen to a position in
the business world which is achieved
only by those who have strength of
character. He was born in Chenango
county. New York, on Aug. 1, 1851. the
son oi' John S. and Elizabeth Curtis,
and was therefore lit years. 5 months
and days old. When eighteen years
of ago he joined his brothers, Charles
P. and George M. Curtis, in their sasli
and door i'actorjf at Clinton, Iowa, com
mencing his business career by enti r
ing' the factory and thoroughly learn
ing the practical end of the business.
In 1872 lie went on the road for the
firm and his trips brought him t'o Wau
sau.-- Hp grasped the opportunity
there was here for a factory of the
same kind, and in 1881 the firm of Cur
tis Bros. A company was established
here as a branch of the Clinton com
pany. In 1893 the Curtis & Yale, com
pany was incorporated, taking over
the local business and also the jobbiri
house at Minneapolis of the same
name. Starting in a appall way, tho
local company is now the largest fai
tory in tho city, employing a^jout 600
people, and one of the largest of its
kind in the state. It lias successfully
weathered all financial storms of the
past thirty-four years, largely through
the business acumen of the deceased.
In addition to the Curtis & Yale
company, of which he was president,
when he died. Mr. Curtis was also
president of the Fenwood Lumber
company and president of the Ingram
Lumber company. When the First
National bank was organized in 188°
lie was elected a director, which posi
tion he has held ever since. In 1908,
ag an appreciation of his steadfast
work, he was honored by being made
recond vice president of the bank,
succeeding the late R. E. Parcher, be
ing re-elected every year since that,
time. He brought to the bank's af
fairs the same keen judgment and
strict integrity which h'ave been prom
inent characteristics of his life.
Mr. Curtis was married at Clinton,
Iowa, to Miss.Emma M. Gulick, of that
city, who, with two sons, John E. and
Walter E.. both of this city, and five
grandchildren, survive him.
He was a natural leader, a strong
executive. He handled his large force
cf men with a firm hand, but alwavs
with exact justice. His integrity was
never questioned, his good faith never
doubted. He' was always identified
with the best things in the city and
•was always foremost in the. endeavor
to -make Wausau a bfggr and Better
city in which to live. He was a con
sistent member of the Baptist churdi
and a liberal -contributor to its main
tenance.
iri
the Wausau Daily Record Herald,
which will be of interest to-Unison
people who remember Mr, Curtis- at
the time he was engaged in bUsiucss
in Denison. The article follows:
Cornelius S. Curtis, president' of
the Curtis & Yale company, and one
of Wausau's most prominent citizens,
died suddenly Wednesday night of
apoplexy. He had spent-the evening
at the Wausau club seemingly in per
fect health, and walked home with his
son, Walter E. Curtis-, about half past
ten o'clock. About midnight, as he
had not come upstairs, Mrs. Curtis,'
who liaj retired, went down to the liv
ing room to seek him, and found him
sitting in his chair, dead. It is evi
dent that he had iutended to read for
a while before retiring, as was his cus
tom. Physicians were immediately
sumniQued, but their efforts were of
no avail, life having departed.
News of Mr. Curtis' demise came fcs
a great shock to the people of Wau
sau, where he had been so-prominent
a figure for more than tliirty-four
years. On every hand, throughout the
day, his untimely death was the topic
of conversation, and the regret was
universal. Expressions of esteem
came from men in all walks of life,
An ardent republican, he was never
an office seeker or office holder, thougn
he was a deloeate to the national con
vention in :tS92, which nominated Ben
jamin Harrison for president. Ho
was. always :t regular republican, nev
er trailing off after false gods, arid was
a firm believer in the principles an I
traditions of the party. He served
several terms as member of the board
of education and as supervisor on the
county board.
Mr. Curtis was a member of the
Wausau club, of which he had served
as president, of the Wausau Country
club and was a thirty-second degree
Masoni being a member of all local
Masonic bodies and of the Wisconsin
Consistory.
He was also a vice president of the
Great Northern Life Insurance com
pany of Wausau and a director of the
Wausau Street Railroad company.
It is a sad coincidence that his
elder brother, Charles Franklin Cur
tis, of Clinton, Iowa, died of apoplexy
on December 21st.

DENISON LOSES
AT BASKET BALL
Fast Carroll Team Defeated D. H. S.
Team Saturday Evening at Gym
nasium by Score of 24 to 23
TWO PLAYERS ARE REMOVED
Local Team Lacked Practice, But
Pup Up Good Exhibition—Team
Not Disheartened by Defeat
The first basketball game ol tho.
season was lost by the Denison hig:i
school team to the Carroll his'i
school team- in one', of the fastest.
games ever witnessed in Denison on
last Saturday evening, the score at
Ihe end ot the game being 24 to 2o.
There was a good crowd in attendance
at the game, which commenced prompt
ly at 8 o'clock, and despite the ener
getic support"#)! tjie Denison rooters,
Denison was unable to ,w}j| a victory
over the Carroll team, it was Car
roll's eight!* ganio so far this season
and the.v exhibited some mightv fine
team work, which seemed to be lack
ing on Denison's part.
Two ot Denison's crack plaverr,,
Locke and Gary, were removed from.:
the game soon after it started by the
officials tor' personal fouls, but the
Denison bovs took this good natured-.
ly and went right ahead playiog the?
best kind of a game.
At the end of the first half the score
stood 1:1 to in favor of the visitors,
with Carroll showing considerable
strength. The second half Denison-.
braced up and exhibited some classy
plnvine, but Carroll's lend was too-'
great for our bovs to overcome. At
one time during this half Denison was
four points ahead, but this was whit
tied down on account ot the locals
fouling so often.
Denison's team is not discouraged
•after the defeat and expect to come
back strong in the next game. Con-J
sidenng the amount ot practice work:
which tliev have done they put up a.'
strong game and mado a very good*
showing. A number of high school)
students have a good chance to win a
place on the team and before the seas-?'
on is over it is expected that Denison.:
will have one of the fastest teams
this section of the state, 'fjie lineup^
of -the tfenison team at'the Saturdays
game was as follows: Cavett. center
McHenry and FHnn. guards Locked
and- Garv, forwards. Substitutes:}"
Teut tor Locke and O'Connor tor Gary...
There is everv advantage in trad
ing with the firms that advertise in
the Denison newspapers. ...The non
advertiser that tells vou he can sell.:
cheaper because he spends no money
for advertising shows by that very
argument how little, he knows ot mod
ern methods of advertising. You your
self know he is wrong. Do you ever
go out. of town to trade? If you do,
you do not go into the city and hunt''
up the stores whose advertisements
you have never seen. You hurry to
tho stores vou are familiar with:,
through their advertising. Ask your-,
self then if advertising pays. It pays
the store and pays the customer. It
is a-well known tact that the stores
that use a liberal amount of advertis
ing space are doing-the bulk of the
business and thus aro able to turn
their stocks several times each year,
and the customers of these stores nro.
alwav able to buy new and seasonable
merchandise at the lowest possible
price.
