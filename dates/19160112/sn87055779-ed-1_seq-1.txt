That the
British col-
cnies will soon hav? a much larger
voice in directing the destinies of
the British empire is foreshadowed
here from an interview given by
Andrew Bonar Iiw. the colonial
secretary, to an Australian news
agency.
When the time comes for the dis
cussion of peace, Mr. L-nv is quoted
as aying". "the dominions will be
consulted and their views will have
great weight in determining what the
terms of pace shall be."
"I speak for myself only," the
secretary continued. "But it is my
hope that as a result of the war we
may create an imper'al parliament
in which every one of the dominions
shall have its full share in propor
tion of its population and resources
in governing the empire."

The, efforts of Kir Edward Carsem,

Sen. Lodge and Leon J. Ca
navo, Head of Mexican Bu
reau to Hold Confer
ence With Lansing.
WAIUNGTON. Jan. 12. Sec'y of
s'tate Lansing announced today that
no American official had been au
thorized to grant permission to
Americans to go into southern Chi
huahua. He said that while it was
true that Carranza, at the time he
v as recognized, had agreed to pro
tect Americans throughout the re
public, he could not be expected to
dc so in sections controlled by
i ebels.
He said that a demand for sum
mary apprehension and punishment
of the men guilty of taking the
Americans off the train and killing
them had been made on Carranza
through Consul Filllman, who is now
the head of the defacto government.
Sen. Lodge of Massachusetts,
ranking republican member of tho
senate committee on foreign affairs,
called at the state department early
today and requested an immediate
interview with Sec'y Lansing. It
was granted him. After he had been
with the secretary live minutes, Leon
J. Canavo. head of the bureau of
Mexican affairs, was called into the
conference. He took with him all
dispatches received by the state de
partment to elate on the massacro
of the Americans in Mexico.
Is Deplorable Affair,
"This is a deplorable affair, but I
c.-iiinot saiy what action should be
taken yet." said Pen. Lodge as he
went into tho conference.
.So , far as the administration is
concerned it was made plain that
no action has been decided upon. It
v.as learned that no announcement
will be made at the white house, as
was done following the sinking of
the Lusitania and the Persia.
At the war department it was said
not a single official dispatch had
been received relating to the mas
sacre. i?ec'y Garrison said he had
received unofficial word that 16
Americans had been killed by Mex
icans. The last dispatch from Collector
Cobb said that 15 Americans and
one Canadian were victims of the
Mexicans, tate department officials
made it plain that they must ascer
tain what the Americans were doing
in Mexico before they can decide on
any action.
Warned to Keep Out.
Leon J. Canova, chief of the Mex
ican bureau, pointed out today that
the state department had warned all
Americans out of Chihuahua and
Sonora on Oct. 9. He said that the
elepartment has knowledge of about
200 Mormons and -100 other Ameri
cans remaining in those two states.
The state depaitment issued a list
of the murdered Americans, re
ceived from its consular agents along
the border. The list did not contain
the names of W. B. Pearce, J. W.

telegrams that reached

American
and British olllcials and friends and
relatives of the murdered men, there
were learned today grewsome details
of the massacre of unarmed citizens
of the United States. They prove
that th1 massacre was one of the
most fiendish of the hundreds that
have markeel the course of the revo
lution in Mexico.
Dragfed from the train on which
they were enroute to resume mining
operations in western Chihuahua,
their passports from the Carranza
officials at Juarez and Chihuahua
scoffed at, the Americans were strip
ped of their clotning and clubbed,
bayonetted or otherwise tortured.
Then their bodies were riddled with
bullets and left lying beside the
track near Santa Ysabel.
According to official messages re
ceived here by the American author
ities. Gm. Villa in person led the
squad of soldiers who held up tho
train just after it had passed the
patrol post at Kilometer No. 6S and
went through the train at the head
of his men searching for all Amer
ican passengers.
As fa.t as the Americans were
found they were erdered out of the
train. Those who were reluctant
to obey the command to get off were
stabbeel in th back with bayonet3
and thrown bodily out of the cars.
The massacre occurreel about 4
o'clock Monday morning. Most of
the Americans were asleep when
they were roughly awakened and
hustled out of the tra'n. Every pro
test they made was met with curses
and bayonet Jabs.
To make certain that no Amer
icans escaped the Mexicans went
through the train twice. When as
sured that no others wire aboard
they pot off and completed their
bloody task by shooting the helpless
prisoner.

lavatory in the train, where he heard
the crie-s of the victims as they were
tortured and finally put to death;
the other said that he was at the
end of the line of prisoners lined up
for shooting, but dashed away as
the command to lire was given and
escaped the shots fired after him.
That other passen cers on the
train, numbering about ."0 and nil
Mexicans, were not molested, was
taken by American mining men here
today as evidence that the massa
cre was "Pancho" Villa's jrrim notice
of reprisal for the recognition of the
Carranza faction by the Fnited
States.
Returning to Work.
Indignation against the. Carranza
governnie-nt mounted high on the
border today when reports re-ached
here th;it Curranzista olla-ials bad
been askel to furnish a military
fiuaril for the train, but had refused,
declaring there was no dan-e-r of at
tack. The Americans were going
back to their work in th" mines of
Mexico after their employers had
received assurances from the Car
ranza leaders that their ir.ter-sts
voubl be protected.

J obrcgon, commander-in-chief of the
Carranza armies, in a speech at a
anuuet at Paso I ei Norte, utg'-d
Americans to return to Mexico and
resume their occupations, assuring
tht:n that Villa's power was broken
forever; that tlie war in Mexico was
over, and that the resumption of
t commerce ami industry was a.i mat

Villa Haled Wat'n.
In connection with Villa's veiled
threat in his announcement :tfter
the recognition of the Carranza gov
ernment that he was no longer re
sponsible for the sifety of foreign
ers in Mexico, it was recalled here
today that open enmity his existed
! for
two years between Gen. Mgr.
Watson of the Cud Mining Co., one
f the massacre victims, and Villa.
Villa had frequently accused Wat-
States 'il!a sumomnerj Watson and
gave hi mthi v.-aming:
