FOR OILING STREETS
Commercial Club Takes Initia
tive Towards Securing This
Improvement.
At the Commercial lub meeting
last night the preliminary steps to
wards securing the minis of citv
streets was taken. The Committee
on. Highways was directed to secure
the netessar data regarding most
approved methods ot appiing the oil
and the cost, and appoint committees
of citizens residing along the thoro
tares which should be oiled, to circu
late the necessar petitions to be pre
bented to the City Council. There
was considerable discussion pro and
con before this action was taken, and
the consensus ot opinion was that it
properly applied and cared for oiled
streets are a success and much more
effective in keeping down the dust
than water sprinkling
Prof. E L. llodegeb presented the
report of last tars garden contest
and the prizes were ordered paid, but
by request of the committee the pub
lication of the report is deferred un
til next week The contest was a
great success and has attracted state
wide attention

ot the public improvement committee.
Over two hundred boulevard trees
were set out last vear, and all trees

SEVENTEEN FREIGHT CARS
DERAILED AT HOLLAND
Service Temporarily Crip-
pled Sioux City Division
Last Saturday.
Trains were delayed and journeys
of passengers were temporarily dis
continued last Saturday afternoon and
evening, following the derailment of
seventeen freight cars at Holland, that
morning. Just how the wreck happen
ed is not known but either a broken
rail, or broken flange on one of the
cars, is thought to have been the
cause. The engine and four cars of
train No. 420 passed safely over the
fatal spot, but the next seventeen box
cars were derailed, many of them tum
bling down the twenty-five foot em
bankment, scattering their contents
in all directions. The wrecking crew
were called from this city, and put
in some hard work before the track
was cleared so trains could run thru.
No. 32 reached here about 6 o'clock
Saturday evening, but in order to ac
commodate the passengers who had
tickets for points east of here, a spec
ial train was run, leaving here about
nine o'clock.
No. 52, due into this city at 3:30
a. m., arrived at noon Sunday. Fast
Mail train No. 288, was held here, and
carried the passengers eastward
bound. Those who came in the night
before, and those coming in Sunday
noon, were not so fortunate however,
and were forced to remain in this
city until Monday afternoon. How
ever, the railroad company voluntar
ily paid for their board and lodging,
at the Savoy, thus doing away with
some of the inconvenience.

HARRISON UNION TELEPHONE
COMPANY ANNUAL MEETING
Held Last Saturday Afternoon Offi
cers Elected for Coming Year.
The annual meeting of the Harrison
Union Telephone Company was held
last Saturday afternoon, January 8th
in the school house of District 4,
Town of Harrison. The following of
ficers were elected to serve during
the coming year:
President—Olaus Anderson.
Vice President—S. M. Dahl.
Secretary—Edw. Bredeson.
Treasurer—Herman Gratz.
Anton Lucken and James McManua
were chosen directors for three years
each.
Reports of the various officers were
read and approved, and routine busi
ness transacted. It was decided to
hold the annual meeting the second
Saturday of June each year, instead
of the second Saturday of January.
Tank Sleigh Turns Turtle.
Hans Ronning, an employee of the
Bartles, Scott Oil Co., of this city, is
confined to his home, as the result of
an injury received last Thursday. He
and Olaf Sundt were enroute for Lake
Elizabeth to fill oil orders, and when
they were about eleven miles out, the
sleigh struck a drift at the side of the
road, resulting in a spill. The two
men were well bundled up, and this
made it almost impossible to jump to
safety. Ronning was pinned beneath
the tank, and his leg severely wrench
ed. Sundt secured a sleigh from a
nearby farm house, and drove the in
jured man back to this city.
None of "the precious juice" con
tained in the tank was lost owing to
the fact that the latest thing in safe
ty valves, known as triplex, are em
ployed on the tank wagon. One allows
the air to escape when oil is drawn,
another allows it to escape when the
oil expands in hot weather and the
third keeps the tank perfectly tight, in
such a case as occurred Thursday.
Meeting of Bank Stockholders.
The stockholders of the Farmers'
and Merchants' State Bank of Kandi
yohi held a meeting at that place,

Pladsen, William Brandt and Edwin

sen were elected directors.
The stockholders figure very strong
ly on building in the spring, a fine
location, the corner lot. just west of
the hotel, being the property of the
bank.
Attempt at Burglary.
When Hans Rude, salesman at the
Glarum grocery, reached the store on
Monday morning, he discovered that
an attempt had been made to enter
the building during the previous
ni«?ht, via th«* rear window. The
screen had been taken from the win
dow, and a hole made in one of the
panes of glass. On encountering the
difficulty of raising the sash and
breaking thru Mr. Glarum's burglar
proof shutter, however, the would-be
thief changed his mind, replaced the
screen and continued on his way.
Barber Shop Has New Owner.
Mr. B. T. Oto» has sold the Metro
politan Barber Shop, located in the
basement of the Bank of Willmar, to
Mr. Hugh Campbell, the tonsorial ar
tist who has been Mr. Otos* chief as
sistant for a number of years back.
Mr. Otos has been suffering from
rheumatism during the last few weeks
to the extent that he has been un
able to come to the shop, and hence
concluded to sell out. Mr. Campbell
will undoubtedly continue to make the
shop a popular place.
