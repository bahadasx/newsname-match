WED ALL BENEFIT BY
R. R. ELECTRIFICATION
Chicago's Smoke Inspector Calls the Recent Smoke;
Nuisance Decision Wrong Says Electrification
Means 'Cleaner, Healthier City.
Chicago wanted the railroads to
electrify; the people were tired of
coughing up soot and dirt from thsir
lungs; they were sore. So the coun
cil started hot after the smoking rail
roads that was in 1913.
But big business, alias the Associ
ation of Commerce, stepped in and
said: "Let us investigate and report
on this electrification problem." And
the railroads generously offered to
pay a half million for expenses of the
investigation.' The council agreed to
wait.
The association finally came
through with- the report a jnonth or
so ago. It was elegant, ponderous
and said that although electrification,
was a good thing Chicago could wait?
for it The railroads didn't cause
much of the smoke nuisance, was its
tip, and if they did they couldn't af
ford to. electrify at present
The railroad paid the half million
and were satisfied; the Association of
Commerce tendered the report first
to the trust press, then to the coun
cil, and everything was serene.
Everything was beautiful until
Smoke Inspector Reid broke loose
with a review and opinion of the
Ass'n of Commerce-report yesterday
