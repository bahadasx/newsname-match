Tribute to Rev. G. W. Perryman.
Id the passing of Rev. G. W. Perry
man, of Winchester, Ky., the Baptists
have lost one of their best preachers
in the State, and the temperance
cause one of its strongest advocates,
the people at Jarge one of their best
friends in every good cause.
He was born and reared on a farm
in Russell county, near Montpelier,
within one and a fourth miles of
where the writer was reared. There
were ten children born and reared in
this home, live brothers and five sis
ters. Two brothers and three sisters
survive him, and one brother resides
in this county. Montgomery, and the
others in Texas. His father and
mother, G W. and Emily Ferryman,
lived in straightened circumstances in
the rearing of such a large family, on
a worn out farm, but they were Godly
people and reared their childn&Jn the
fear of God, and they all enlisted in
the cause of Christ in their youth.
Dr Perryman, the subject of this
.sketch, was the youngest boy and was
a favorite of the family and the people
of the community. He attended the
urau miuui um wntci evei tauguu,
and he was a good, faithful student
and possessed a genial disposition.
He gave his heart, to God in his youth
at old Liberty Church, during a Bap
J4sfc .revival, - and united with the
church there, which he revered the
remainder of his days, and always en
joyed the time of his return to the old
church and neighborhood. We could
sing to his memory to-day:
"There's a church in the valley of the
wildwood.
Kb lovlier spot in the dale;
No place is so dear to my childhood,
As the little brown church in the
vale."
It was his customto come back ev
ery few years as long as his mother
lived and have all-day meeting at old
Liberty, on the fourth of July, but
after the going of mother (whom he
dearly loved and revered.) his visits
were less frequent. But he came last
year for the last time, and had the
greatest gathering of all previous
ones, and how he did enjoy the day
and the hand-shaking and hearty
greetings of his friends. But who
thought of it being the last visit to
the dear old spot? The scripture
statement that "A prophet is not with
out honor save in his own country,"
like all other rules, has its exceptions,
for I am sure Dr. Ferryman's home
people esteemed him as highly as any
other people did.
Soon after his conversion he decided
to give his life to the preaching of
the gospel, believing he was called of
God to the ministry. He preached
his first sermon at old Providence
church in the near by community,
. from Ps. 84:11. "For the Lord God is
a sun and shield, the Lord will give
grace and glory: no good thing will He
withhold from them that walk up
rightly " The selection of this text
for his first sermon is indicative of his
strong trust in God.
He was a relative of my first wife
and we saw there was something in
him above the ordinary, and we en
couraged him to educate himself and
prepare for the besst in life. We made
it possible for him to attend college
in this town when Elder W. K. Azbill
was President of Columbia Christian
College. He remained here only five
months, and went the next year to
Russellville College and finished his
education at Louisville in the Baptist
Tneological Seminary. His first pas
torate was the church at Owenton,
Ky. Soon after entering on his min
istry there he felt the need of a com
panion and helpmeet, and he met and
wooed Miss Sallie E. Waters at Mid
dleburg, Ky , where her father was
principal of the College there. He
was surely led of God in his selection
? Miss Sallie Waters for his life part
ner and companion. They were mar
ried at Danville, Xy., in 1886, and
went at once to their church at Owen
ton, where he did a good work and
was much appreciated.
They went from Owenton to Yeva,
Ind., and from Veva to Newport, Ky ,
where he remained a number of years
and built a new churchhouse and
.built up the cause there to the satis
faction of the church. Preached 1
year in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was
called from there to Middlesboro, Ky.
From there to Paducah. From there
to Knoxville, Teen , where he did the
greatest work of his life. From there
he was called to Norfolk, Va. He
was asked, while there, to take the
field for State-Wide in old Virginia,
which he did and the State went dry.
He then accepted a call to Winchester,
Ky., where in a little more than one
year during which time there was
about 150 members added to the church
I was glad that I had the privilege to
attend the .funeral services Y never
could have known how the people
elsewhere appreciated him. I have
never known a man more highly es
teemed by a people than he was by
the church and people of Winchester.
Then most all the churches where
he had been pastor"1 sent messengers
bearing flowers and messages of love
and sympathy to the bereaved family.
Knoxville sent four messengers and
their preacher to Winchester.
He leaves a wife and four children
to mourn their loss, with a host of
friends and relatives. Bulah, Lucile,
Corinne and George W , Ji., are the
names of the children. Lucile is mar
ried and lives in Norfolk, Ya.
The family have so endeared them
selves to the people of Winchester
that they asked Mrs. Perryman to
bury her dead with them A nice lot
was presented for his Uist resting
place. The family will remain there
for the present
I never saw such a display of flow
ers sent in by friends from all over
the country. The funeral services
were planued by Mrs Perryman and
was the most comforting I think 1
ever attended. The following was
the program:
'Neareaj my God to Thee', was sung
by Quartett.
Scripture reading by C. C. Carroll.
Prayer byT C Ecton, Lexington.
"Sometime We'll Understand" sung
by Quartett.
Address, "Dr. Perryman as a citizen
and Neighbor," b Wm. Lindsey.
"Dr. Perrymau as a preacher and
pastor," Dr. Sampey, of Louisville.
Song "Never Alone."
Address "Dr. Perryman as a Tem
perance Orator and Eeformer '' by
Dr. Nowlin, of Knoxville, Tenu
Hymn "Home Sweet Home."
The services were out iof the ordi
nary, they were comforting and help
ful His death came sudden and un
expected both to himself and his
friends and family.
"Blessed are the dead which die in
the Lord, yea sayeth the Spirit that
the) may rest from their labors and
their works do follow them."

The Misty Past.
The Burning of a Candle.
The excellent article in The News,
(The Passing Year,) by our friend and
kinsman Senator Neat, touched a re
sponsive chord in my breast and set
me considering how,, few of, my old
friends and associates survive tx real
ize the fieetness of our earthly" exist
ence. Let one be absent from' a com
munity for several years in which he
has been acquainted, and inquire con
cerning old friends and the re
sp nse in most cases will be gone, gone.
But none can fully appreciate the
changing scenes of life on the- canvass
of time, unless taught in that dear
school of experience as Senator Neat
has been, and happy should he be
who likewise, can display an. untar
nished record of four score years of
right, for' right's sake, devoid of all j sickens and death approaches. Lying
Did you ever sit and watch the pass
ing of a candle, and at the same time
be reminded of the going out of life?
You. light a candle and thespurm com
menced to melt, and minute by min
uteit shortens, and after a while it
reaches the flickering stage. Watch
how it tries to hold its power, but
presently it flickers for the last time,
never again to throw out a ray of
right.
Almost identically is the passing of
the human life. A babe is born and
day by day jou see it grow and do
velop, and soon. the age of maturity is
reached, and after awhile old age
comes. You see the old man totter

desire for display of affectation with
that as the prominent incentive. But
the great change of scene must soon
come, of which we hear so much and
know so little. 'Tis said that we are
dying from birth until we pass out of
our earthly existence About (55 years
ago I witnessed my first death bed
scene, when James Lester, my grand
father died in a room of the house oc
cupied by Mr Dewitt McFarJand,
near Montpelier, Ky. His family and
f rientls thought, him dead, and were
preparing him for burial, when he re
vived and talked for some time, dur
ing which he said, it was sweet to die
under the sound of all ones children,
of which there were eight, all at his
bedside, then spoke calmly of his pe
culiar sensations, saying he supposed
they should know how any one felt
when dying. Said everything ap
peared green aud clouded, then passed
away while one of the elder children
supported me in his arms. I observed
his unnatural appearance, although I
did not fully comprehend the gravity
of the occasion. I can never forget
those impressions made upon my
childish mind. One by one we cross
the river.
I was grieved to learn through the

This love of money the root of all

Temperance in its full sense, is one -of
the crowning Christian graces, except

"precisely the same that, would extend
the arms of love and affection, em

The patrons and friends of ane
Valley school, were made to feel just
ly proud, when on the afternoon of
Dec. 23, they were entertained by the
pupils under the management of their
efficient teacher, Mrs. Mary S. Biggs.
We have not space to mention every
piece rendered, but it was a decided
success from start to finish.
Each one taking part did well, re
flecting credit to themselves and their
teacher's training.
Every pupil responded with that
cheerfulness brought about only by
love and respect between pupil and
teacher.
Santa Claus and a Christmas tree
was an important feature ot the oc
casion and a delight to the children, as
every one was remembered by their
teacher.
"Miss Mary" was also the recepient
of a number of gifts from her pupils
showing the high esteem and love in
which she is held.
Mrs. Biggs has given a number of
entertainments, at this place, having
taught here several years in the be
ginning of her career as teacher.
Her pupils now are children of those
taught in former days.
While "Miss Mary" has not been
actively engaged in the public schools
for a few years, she seems to have
lost; none of her zest or efficiency
which placed her in the front ranks as
an educator in former days.
Cane Valley feels complimented and
gratified that she chose this, place to
resume her life work, when she first
started out as teacher.
