Progressingj
In his add res? on ".Tho Year's
Progress", delivered before the
Kducational Conference in
Richmond Nov. 2lth, State
Sunt. It. ('. Stearoes cited cer?
tain fuels and llgurcs which in?
dicates remark able activity oh
the part of those ehurgeil with
the training of the young in the
Old Dominion. As an nvitlence
of the interest shown in Kdnca
lion during the last twelve
months the State Supt. declared
that: ?
More than one million dollars
were expended for schoolhouaea
alone while plans for scores of
new buildings arc under way.
Thousands of dollars were
contributed out. of the private
purses of school patrons.
The increase in enrollment
was more than 28,000,
The school revenues reached
a total of $6,82:1,451.29.
Wliite illiteracy, between the
ages of 10 ami 20, has been re
duced from24,521 to less than
15,000.
Negro illiteracy, between till?
ages of in ami 20, has been re
duced from :tl ,204 to less than
10,000.
Buchanan County, in 11)10,
had l>290 illiterate children be
ween lu and 20 years of age; to?
day it has only 27'.' illiterates.
The percentage has been re
duced from 22.2 to h.2.
The school enrollment, ses?
sion 1014-15, was 442,000; this
session it 18 about 470,000.
Within the last three yeais
the increase in enrollment has
been more I ban ?; 1,000 -as much
indued, as the increase of the
preceding nineteen years.
Division superintendents dur?
ing the session .of 11*14-15 paid
12.0UO visits to schools as coin
pared with 40,111 during the
session of 10i3-1 1.
New courses of study ? the
work of nearly a hundred lead,
ing educators -have been pre
pared for the elementary ami
high schools.
The study of doincsl ic Bcionce,
agriculture ami the manual
arts will bo especially encourag?
ed and fostered.
A plan for the standardiza?
tion of one and two-room rural
schools has been devised.
Hut although school revenues
increased !|t:i(i5,4:tO 01 (Stale
$173,022.25 and County $191,
508 80) the increase was not
cotnim-iisurale with the UllOr
inous gains in school enroll?
ment. More funds, therefore,
are sadly needed if proper ed
ucational facilities are Id be
furnished all of the children
who knock at the doors of Vir?
ginia's sohoolhousoH. Since
local levies have almost reach?
ed their limit, the State must
come to the rescue. The Legis?
lature will be asked to increase
the school funds $1,600,000.

lowing ""' publication of the
report nf llio Tuberculosis coin
mission appointed by Governor
Stuart, moinbcra of tliocominis:
uion, otlieors anil members nf
lite Statt- Hoard of Health and
tin- executive officers nf tin1
State Anti-Tuhorcutosis Asso
ciaiiun am receiving many let?
ters endorsing tin! program of
tho commission and pledging
support in presenting tho cause
nf tuberculosis' prevention to
tlin < leneral Assembly.
Particular interest, it ap?
pears, is being taken in that
part of Ilia commission's report
which relates to tbe prevalence
of tuberculosis among tin- ne?
groes nf tb" St.it.?. Noting the
|ligh death-rate from OOllBlimp
lion among negroes, the com?
mission began its work by bav
ing a careful investigation
made nf tbe occupation of till
negroes whose deaths were re?
ported In tbe Stale as due to
this disease. 'I'llis involved
tbe examination of thousands
nf dealb certificates but tbe re?
sult was startling; it was found
that almost half tbe negroes
wlm died from consumption in
tlio State in a given year bail
been engaged in domestic ser?
vier of ono kind or another and
bad been in close contact with
while families, whose health
(.hey bail endangered, linn
tired a of while mot hers, it was
disclosed, had been subjecting
Iben I...Id 's tp tbe menace of
tuberculosis by entrusting thtun
to the earn of colored nurses
suffering from consumption.
It was for thisreaaOn,and bo
Cllhsp tin- Stateat. present makes
im provision whatever for ne?
gro consumptives, other lliun
for tbo criminal and insane,
that tbe commission recom?
mended to the (ieneral Assem?
bly tl.stnbiisliriieni nf a small
tuberculosis sanatorium for ne?
groes wln-re advanced cases can
lie eared for and removed
from contact with persons
whom they might infect. It is
understood that, if the Stute
will make appropriation for
such a sanatorium, the Virgin-;
iii Anti-Tuberculosis Associn
tion, acting fm- a group of or
gnni/.alions, will contribute lib?
erally toward the purchase nf a
site. i
Tita commission's recommen?
dations for a wider campaign
of education to prevent eon
sumption are likewise heilig
discussed by health oUlcers all
over the State. In its repurt,
the commission laid particular
emphasis on this aspect nf the
subject and expressed the Opin?
ion that the State can only ex?
pect tuberculosis to decrease
ilh it informs citizens of the
methods by which the disease
can be prevented. The commis?
sion recommended an appro- j
printiou of $10,000 the year by
the (leneral Assembly for ''ed?
ucational extension" work from
the Cntawba Sanatorium and
Outlined smut! of the methods
lobe employed in carry ing to
till .the people the fundamental
facts about the "(Jreat White
I 'lague."
Another disadvantage of the
Raiser business is tho way he
always has to pretend for
publication that he is proud of
his glorious Turkish allies.

I>uki> 0. Bowers, of Memphis,
Tennessee, lias forty-three ^ro
cery stoics in that town and
sells nearly half of the groceries
consumed there. Sixteen years
ago lie was piling staves in a
Kentucky barrel factory at $8 (><>
per day, and while working at
that job concluded to go into
business for himself. A friend
loaned him $01X1 and he opened
a cash grocery. Mis sales the
first day amounted to just eight
cents. Now lie is rated in the
? Millionaire class. Andrew I,.
Denting quotes Mr. Bowers in
the Si. Louis Republic asfol?
io W SI
"If 1 had no discovered
newspaper advertising; I would
still be struggling for a living
in lhat lirst store instead of hav
inn forty three It came about
this way. A few months after
1 opened my cash grocery 'ii
Columbus, Ky., Charles N.
Walker, who used to edit the
paper there, showed hie il would
Be to my advantage to take a
lialf page ad every week,
changing the ml every issue.
Common sense told me there
was no use running a business
that wool.', s ive people money
unless you told them so, so I
signed a six mouths'contract.
It pulled, io well in fact, that I
used to buy two hundred extra
copies and mail them out over
Carlisle county to see if 1
couldn't get the farmers to come
to Columbus to trade. Brett)
soon I became the hingest ad?
vertiser that Walk er had. Half
page had become loo small for
ine; I began to use pages. And
business picked up accordingly.
Seeing the success possible in a
cash business pushed by good
advertising, I sold out to go
where I could get the greatest
results from my efforts. Just
before stal l in^ to Memphis, an
uncle of mine called me out for
a private talk. 'Duke', lie said,
'you're not going to .Memphis
Mine enough, are you?' 'That is
what I am going to do.' I re?
plied. 'I'm going down there
ami go into the grocery business
right away.' lie shook his
bead sorrowful like and. said,
'Duke, those newspapers will
get all the money you've ^ot.
Charlie Walker has he.mi mak?
ing more out of your business
than you have/ 'Well, l he
now spa peril have gotten a lot
out of me, but my greatest re?
gret is that I didn't let them
have more.'
"Then yon believe inii'vc
tiRing?" Mr. Bower- was a tl.
"1 am not merely a bolievui . .
advertising,'' was tho prompt
rejoinder,"! am almost a ma?
niac on the subject. 1 firmly
believe if 1 had only spent hail'
so much for advertising as I
have spent, I wouldn't I e worth
half so much as 1 am worth.
Furthermore, 1 am convinced
that if 1 had been foresighted
enough to spend'twice as much
for advertising as I have spent,
that 1 would be worth twice
what 1 am worth."
Care of Animals
Savage tribes of Indians,
Africans, etc., according to
histories usually have as one of
their number a "Medicine Man"
who is believed to be able to
charm away all diseases aud
troubles of all sorts. He was
about as efficient as a <i mouths
baby in tho halls of Congress,
knowing nothing of anatomy,
[physiology or medicine und his
common, sense, if lit- luid any,
blinded by foolish quack notions
und charms.
Some of our people still cling
to these absurb idous and some
communities even linyu their
"Medicine .Man", who is gener?
ally n man below the average
in intelligence, whoso occupa?
tion may lie entirely foreign to
that of treating the sick, such
as butchering, black smithing
or what not. He is believed to
have some mysterious power of
treating the sick people or ani?
mals. We know of one com
munity where i>lj old half vvitteel
darkey is called in to doctor the
sick animals. This in a civi?
lized country! A medical doc?
tor is generally culled on to ad?
minister to the need nf sick
people but the medicine man
is good enough tn doctor the
sic); animal .1 : splits the cow's
tails lor "lloliow Tail" and
bores into the horn or cuts
them oil' with a hand saw for
"Hollow Horn" and other
equally absurd things. Why
cling to those ancient customs:''
A good cow is worth more than
some people, When you have
a sick animal call in a vetera
nary doctor if available, if not
get some reasonable, itlteiligauT
person who thinks a little some
times and docs not depend on
(|Uuck notices. There is no
such disease as "Hollow Horn"
or "Hollow 'rail." To cut Oil
the horns or bore boles in them
or split tbe tail is barbarous
and cruel.
When an animal becomes
suddently or violently ill some
vital organ is effected, not the
horns or tail. If these organs
were diseased tile animals
Would not, be seriously ell'eeted
until the disorder attacked some
more vital part of the body.
The horn is always low in lent
perature compared to the rest of
the body,us it isn good conductor
nf heal and the heat of the body
is radiated olt rapidly. When
it is unsually cool ii is an indi
cation that the animal is weak.
I'll! her up, put a blanket over
her anil feed her some warm
stimulating food, The horn is
never hollow and neither is the
tail.
A common disease among
milk cows immedititaly after
the calf is born is milk fever.
This is particularly common
[among large heavy milkers and
heavy feeders. Tbe sym Loins
are uniisal excitement ami uer
voiiBhess, uneasiness about the
byes. The cow may try Hi mount)
into tbe manger or lie down
and get lip und beul herself
against the side nf the Stull.
Give lier a simple purgative us
tk drench--u poll ml to a half
pound nf epson salts, a pint of
castor oil, milk the udder dry
and bath it in as hot water us
i he eow can bear. l'ump uir
into the udder through the teats
with ;i by cycle pump and milk?
ing tube and lie the teals so us
in leave the udder distended.
Cover the cow- with a blanket
and keep all dogs und other ox
exciting iiilliiences away from
her. K.-od lightly fur a day or
80, We have known of several!
ins'uiiees where a cow with
i.-it . fever bud her horns sawed
oiT, her I i f open and even
..' .'ih. '1 .? nit: and other-i
i mugs until the
i. tiiaj died- To make Use
ilguratiye expression people
Woo'allow their animals In be
tortured in this way should be
educated before entering .Mai ion
asylum,
?Simple purgatives such as
opson! Baits, im seed oil (raw;,
caster oil, etc., are nearly al?
ways in order with sick ani?
mals. Remember your animals
possess a body lipt so very dif?
ferent from your own. Cull in
a veteranary doctor when your
animals goi sick. If you can?
not get one don't cull on the
".Medicine Miju" but gel an in?
telligent, sensible person who
does not believe in "Hollow
Horn", "Hollow Tail nnd other
quack notions.
