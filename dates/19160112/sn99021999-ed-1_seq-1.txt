at the regular annual meeting and
election scheduled by the federal
banking law to occur on January 11.
Milton T, Barlow, vice president
of the United States National bank,
became president of that institution
to succeed the late Victor B. Cald
well, who died only a little over a
week ago. Mr. Barlow was presi
dent of this Institution for a number
of years, and was only last year suc
ceeded by Mr, Caldwell, who did not
live to serve out his year's term.
Several other Important changes oc
curred in the United States National.
Gurdon W. Wattles, vice president, was
made chairman of tho board of directors.
William K. Rhodes, cashier, was made
first vice president; George K. Jlaver
atlck, assistant cashier, was mado second
vice president, and Kobert P. Morsman,
assistant cashier, was made cashier.
New Vice rrealdent Selected.
The Nebraska National, after making

vice president from the directorate. John
McDonald was elected to the directorate,
to succeed M. C. Peters. The other offi
cers and directors remain as before.
The Com Exchange National bank

ing. No changes occurcil- here either in
the officials or in the directorate.
There was some talk of the possibility
of the resignation of a few directors
from some of the banks on account of
the provision of the Clayton law which
calls for the unlocking of interlocking
directorates. Touching on this subject,
O. W. Wattles, vice president of tho
United States National bank said, "I
do not believe that affects Omaha as i
read the law. It specifies cities of over
200,000 population, and according to tho
census we have not et been authorized
to call ourselves such a city."
In the State Bank of Omaha all offi
cers and directors were re-elected with
no changes and no additions.

HAUSER'S ILLNESS
DUE T0T0NSILITIS
May Resume Trial of Smith's Al
leged Murderer After Consul
tation of Physicians.
NO SIGNS OF SCARLET FEVER
Arthur Hauser probably has ton
silitls rather than scarlet fever, phy
sicians said last night after an ex
amination of the throat of the al
leged murderer of W. H. Smith,
Woodmen of the World cashier.
Whether the man is in fit condi
tion to go on trial again today will
be the subject of a consultation this
morning by Dr. Lee Van Camp,
county physician, and Dr. R. W. Con
nell, city health commissioner.
Whatever opinion they may reach
lwll be given to District Judge James
P. English, who 1b presiding at the
trial, and who will decide whether
It will proceed.
Yesterday's last development occurred!
late in the day when Ir. Van Camp after
examining Hauser declared that In all
likelihood the man's aliment was ton
silltls. Earlier In the day the county
physclan had 'summoned Dr. Connell on
account of tho possibility that the bandit
had scarlet fever. No definite evidence
of the more serious disease has been
found, however.
Hour Crowd Disappointed.
A huge crowd of spectators was disap
pointed yesterday when the trial was
continued until this morning as the re
sult of a note which Or. Connell left on
Judge English's desk during the noon
hour. When court convened every bench
was crowded and standing room in the
big court room was almost exhausted.
More than 100 spectators sat in the court
room from 12 to 2 o'clock in order to hold
seats from which they might hear and
see the proceedings clearly. The pros
pect of hearing the first testimony of
Miss Grace Slater, 20-year-old star wit
ness for the state, was an added attrac
tion. Kat l.iinclies In Court Room.
Two women sr.d a man who came la
the morning brought their lunches with
them. At noon they preempted the most
favorable seats in the court roora, spread
napkins over their laps and proceeded to
satisfy their h.inger. Then they waited
patiently until the opening of the after
noon session of court. Tho situation wag
suggestive of tho recent "Billy" Sunuay
meetings In the Omaha tabernacle. There
was a quick exod'.is when a continuance
was taken on acccunt of the defendant's
illness.
Judge English Indicated that he was
anxious to proceed with the trial, unless t
it should be shown that Ilauser's Illness i
was more serious than a mere cold, from
which many persons all over tho city are
suffering! County Attorney Magney said

Iist night Holmes reached Chihuahua '

of his wife, presuming the news of lh
affair had reached the border.
Whether he could send no more Infor
mation, or whether he believed the news
of the raid had reached EI Paso through
the de facto government cannot be ascer
tained, but he sent a message to thn
mining company requesting thst Mrs.
Holmes he advised that he was at tho
capital and safe.
The message was brought to thn offlco
of the American Smelting and Reflnlnif
company and caused anxiety, for It was
known Holmes had been on the train
scheduled to leave Chihuahua City yester
morning for the camp. Before the tele
graphic censorship was Imposed com
munication was established with other
m'ning men In Chihuahua City, and the
report there that the Americans on the
train had been killed reached this city.
