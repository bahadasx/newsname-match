FEDERAL BUSINESS
SHOWS INCREASES
TOTALS OF 1915 MORE THAN
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS
ABOVE 1914
MORE PEOPLE ARE MAKING USE
OF INSURANCE FEATURE OF
THE SERVICE
According to a statement issued by
Postmaster Fred Pfaender the business
transacted at the post office during 1915
has been more then $5,000.00 greater
than that of the preceding year, the total
being $94,869.65, as compared with
$89,868.53 during 1914. The greatest
increase is that of the money order
business transacted, showing total re
ceipts of $72,024.08 against $67,437.96
for the year before. The statement also
shows that the insurance feature in the
parcels post division is being taken ad
vantage of more generally, the increase
in the number of packages insured being
over 100 per cent.
The expenses of the office have been
considerably increased by a raise in the
salaries of clerks and carriers and the
addition of the auxiliary carrier whose
work consists of the delivery of parcels
post packages, the collections at the boxes
and the delivery of mail to large institu
tions not included within the several
carrier districts:

CO, ATTORNEY MAKES REPORT.
According to the annual report of
County Attorney Frederickson sub
mitted to the attorney general his office
has handled 129 cases during the past
year, of which 118 were minor offenses
handled in the municipal and justice
courts and 11 by the District Court. Of
the cases in the District court 3 were
for grand larceny, 3 for abandonment of
children and one each for forgery, rape,
indecent assault, adultery and carnal
knowledge. Seven resulted in convic
tions of which four prisoners were sent
to the state prison, two to the reformatory
and one to the county jail. There were
three dismissals and one acquittal.
In the municipal and justice courts the
of drunkenness predominated with
ii»y tf-".'^
those for violations of the automobile
law running a close second—43 of the
former and 31 of the latter. The balance
of the lower court cases were divided as
follows: malicious mischief, 8 assault
and battery, 7 bastardy, 6 abusive
language, 4 violation of liquor laws, 4
vagrancy, 4 non-support, 3 violation
of pure food laws, 2 peddling without
license, 2 petit larceny, 1 violation of
game laws, 1 violation compulsory edu
cation law, 1 fugitive from justice, 1.
The above prosecutions resulted in
110 convictions, 1 acquittal, 1 dismissal,
4 statutory settlements and 4 cases still
pending. Eight were sentenced to terms
in the county jail and an even hundred
paid their fines.
The costs assessed amounted to $636.
07 fines, $571.00. A total of $1,008.50
in fines and costs was collected during
the year.
WATER DEPT. NEEDS NEW PUMP.
Again the City Waterworks Depart
ment sends out an S. O. S. call to th
city fathers, additional equipment being
needed and the matter of purchasing
another pump for the municipal water
works plant was the main subject for
discussion at the regular meeting of the
City Council last Tuesday evening. It
developed during the discussion that the
so-called "Luitweiler Pump" is beginning
to show the effects of years of wear and
tear and does not hold up under the
strain it is subjected to. The Luit
weiler pump is used on the city's largest
well and it is believed that a new pump
of greater capacity and more modern
construction would deliver a greater
volume of water to the city reservoir.
The water committee contemplates
having the old pump thoroughly over
hauled if a new one is installed and then
placed over the other well. An expert
probably will be called into consultation
to examine the casing and make an
estimate of the cost of repairing the old
pump and installing it over the other
well. If the committee deems it ad
visable to make the change a special
meeting of the council will no doubt be
called to discuss the purchase of a new
pump.
Bids were opened by the council for
furnishing the city with a 12,000 gallon
tank for the stoiage of oil to be usee! iv
street sprinkling. Five bids had been
submitted, the lowest being that of
Wm. Bros. Boiler Manufacturing Com
pany of Minneapolis, the price being
$370 f. o. b. New Ulm.
Bids also had been submitted by the
banks of the city for interest to be paid
on daily balances, deposits, etc. All
the banks submitted the same bid and
the city will as a consequence receive
1 per cent interest on daily balances
and 4 per cent on certificates of deposit.
The city will be charged 6 per cent on
overdrafts.
City Engineer Minium was instructed
by the council to prepare plans and speci
cations for a new house at the city
cemetery and some action may be ex
pected on this matter at the next meet
ing of the council.
Street Commissioner Shiemann re
ported 278 hours of hand labor and 48
hours of team labor put in on the streets
of the city during the past month.
The chief of police and fire marshal
submitted their annual reports, which
were accepted and filed.
Weighmaster Joseph Koehler reported
having scaled 419 loads during December.

way to the corridor, where he found egress
through a small aperture under the iron

His escape was noticed shortly after

An auto was at once requisitioned and as
no one had a clue to the direction the
escaped patient had taken, the searchers
naturally supposed that he had started
for his home in St. George. However,
the sick man had evidently missed his
bearings in the dark and taken the road
to Milford instead. The family on the
Albert Geske farm in Milford township
about 2 miles from the Hospital were
aroused shortly after midnight by queer
noises in the yard and upon investigation
found the unfortunate man crawling
about on his hands and knees. He was
taken into the house and the authorities
notified.

the escapade will have any ill effects

period would doubtless have resulted
seriously.

BOARD OF CENSORS TO BE AP
POINTED TO HEAD OFF
SCHEMES
At the monthly meeting of the Com
mercial Club held at the club rooms
Monday evening an entire glove factory
was offered to the Club for the small
sum of $800.00. According to Marcus
P. Hobart, a real estate dealer of Minnea
polis who made the offer in writing,
this manufacturing plant is conservative
ly worth $2,000.00 and consists of 12
Wheeler & Wilson sewing machines,
power die with full set of machine
dies, two electric motors, all shafting
tabling, cutting tables, racks and figures,
in fact everything that is necessary to
manufacture cotton gloves, mittens,
overalls, shirts, jackets and everything
else in that line. He describes it as a
money maker which was closed out be
cause the management got to fighting
among themselves. This plant would
give employment to about 15 people.
The matter was disposed of by referring
it to the Committee on Industries.
Communications were also read from
Chase and Blodgett of Faribault in re
ference to their coming to New Ulm in
the near future to discuss the packing
plant proposition. They are both will
ing to come whenever their presence
is requested here. On account of the
small attendance present the Club
members present did not feel like taking
any definite action and the matter was
finally disposed of by referring it to a
committee of 5 to be appointed by the
chair to make a thoro investigation of
the proposition and if they deemed it
feasible, to call a meeting which is to be
addressed by the gentlemen from Fari
bault. As such committee Pres. Otto-
J. A. Ochs, J. A. Kennedy, Dr. J. L.
Schoch and J. H. Siegel.
Arrangements have been made to have
H. K. Zuppinger,Secy. of the Commercial
Clubs of the State to come here sometime
in March and deliver an address to the
merchants of the city. He will speak on
"Some Phases of Store Administration".
This was announced by the chairman.
In his address Mr. Zuppinger will touch
upon credits and advertising, matters
which will be of special interest to all
merchants, both large and small.
At the present time the members of
the Club are divided into 3 classes, active
members, associate members and hono-
etoiitu
rary members. The active members
according to the by-laws of the Club
own the property. It was suggested
that if the finances of the Club permit it,
that the property be purchased from the
the active members, so that all the mem
bers of the Club would share in tWI
property equally. Some of the members
present expressed themselves as willing
to donate their interest in the property
to the Club at large and willing to have
the by-laws changed to that effect. This
plan was objected to as not being quite
legal and the matter was finally disposed
of by referring it to a committee consist
ing of William B. Mather and J. F.
Armstrong who are to determine who the
active members are and then proceed
to procure from them a relinquishment
of their rights in the property.
On behalf of the Committee on Char
ities and Advertising, W. B. Mather re
ported that several meetings had been
held and that the Committee had done
considerable work. Prof. Ackermann
who is also on the committee reported
that at the last meeting with Mayor
Fritsche it had been decided to establish
a board of censors,consisting of business
men to be appointed by the Mayor. It is
the idea to have all persons who come here
with advertising schemes or who come
here for the purpose of collecting moneys
for some charitable object or to do gen
eral begging to secure from this board of
censors permission to canvass the city.
It is hoped that with this board of cen
sors established only worthy causes will
be given support hereafter. As the board
has not yet been appointed, the matter
was referred to Chairman Mather who
is to consult with Mayor Fritsche and
have the appointments made without de
lay.
The committee on the municipal heat
ing plant project reported progress and
Supt. August Mueller who was the only
member of the committee present re
ported that at the next monthly meeting
a complete report will be submitted.
Pres. Ottomeyer suggested that an ac
tive campaign be inaugurated to secure
thirty additional members to bring the
membership to two hundred, the num
ber that the Club really should have. No
definite action was taken, however.

FIRST COMMISSIONERS MEETING
Receiving reports of the various
county officers, checking up the finances
of the disbursing officers and fixing the
salaries of the officials occupied most of
the time of the County Commissioners
at their last week's three-day session.
Herman Polkow was again chosen Chair
man of the Board and J. P. Graff, Vice
Chairman. The funds and accounts of
the county treasurer were checked up
by the Board and found to be correct.
Proposals from the various banks of
the county for interest to be paid on
County funds deposited therein were re
ceived, all of them offering 1 per cent.
The various banks were then designated
as depositories and the amounts of their
bonds fixed.
The salaries of the county officials were
fixed by the Board as follows for the year
1916: R. B. Kennedy, superintendent
of schools, $2,000 W. J. Julius, sheriff,
$1,600 Ad. Frederickson, county attor
ney, $1,200 Carl P. Manderfeld, clerk
of court, $1,000 George Ross, judge of
probate, clerk hire, $420 Wm. Johnson,
deputy register of deeds, $300 Arnold
Gulden, overseer poor farm, $540 Rosa
Gulden, help to overseer, $20 per month
Henry Rolwes, janitor, $60 per month.
Three of the county officials' salaries
were increased, the clerk of court and
sheriff $100 each and the superintendent
of schools, $200 per year.
The county attorney's office was voted
a contingent fund of $300 out of which to
defray expenses in the prosecution of
criminal cases and searching for evidence.
While the Brown County Journal was
designated as the official paper of the
county, the financial statement will
probably be published in the New Ulm
Herald-Dispatch, Springfield Advance
Comfrey Times, Hanska Herald and New
Ulm Volksblatt.
The contract for the publication of
the personal property tax list was
awarded the New Ulm Review, the
lowest bidder.
The Board passed a resolution asking
the State Tax Commission to refund the
taxes of the New Ulm Savings & Loan
Association for the year 1915.
ience to the merchants was discussed at Jones of Blue Earth county at Lake
some length and was finally disposed of by
referring it to the committee which pre
pared the mailing list with instructions
to find out what the printing of such a list
would cost and also to find out how many
of the merchants would be willing to pur
chase such a list at a price to be determin
ed upon by the committee. This dis
posed of all matters which required the
attention of the Club and adjournment
followed.
Review and Post also in the Sleepy Eye gates to a state convention which will
place upon the ballots for the primaries
a set of presidential electors. Brown
county is entitled to 23 delegates, the
apportionment being made upon the
basis of one delegate for each 100 votes
cast for Hammond at the last state
election. Chairman Fred Pfaender, of
the county committee, expects to confer
with the party leaders in the near future
and decide upon the time and place of
the convention.

NUMBER 2
COMMITS SUICIDE
BECAUSE OF WAR
DESPONDENT FARM HAND GOES
HUNTINGf AND FAILS TO
RETURN
Great excitement prevailed in Cambria
township, just across the Brown county
line in Blue Earth county, last Monday,
when the report was circulated that a
man had been shot and killed on the Ben
Hughes farm, but it later developed that
it was a plain case of suicide and the
neighborhood quieted down.
The suicide is Eric Anderson, a farm
hand, about 28 years old. He had been
working on several farms in Cambria
since April of last year, most of the time
for C. A. Alkire, but for the past few
months had hired out as a wood chopper
and boarded at the Alkire place.
Last Sunday afternoon he left the
house, taking a repeating shot gun with
him, but did not say where he intended
to hunt, if that was his object in taking
the weapon. Mr. Alkire's young son
wanted to accompany him, but Anderson
told him to stay home. That was the
last seen of the man alive. When he did
not return Sunday night Mr. Alkire began
to inquire at the neighbors', thinking that
he might have stopped there for the
night and when this failed to locate
Anderson, search was made in the woods
where he had been seen to go.
A little dog had accompanied Anderson
on Sunday and the queer actions of the
animal attracted such attention that it
was followed up the creek to near what
is known as the Hughes bridge. There
the frozen body was found —a grewsome
sight. The entire top of his head was
blown off, the brains oozing from the
gashing wound where the shot had come
out of the head. Mr. Alkire did not try
to investigate whether it was murder or
Suicide* but at xmce notified Coroner
Crystal, who arrived upon the scene
about noon, accompanied by the sheriff.
A cursory examination revealed it to
be a plain case of suicide. The body
was on its side with one knee drawn up.
The other leg was stretched and a cord
attached to the toe of the shoe at one end
and to the trigger of the gun at the other
showed the means the unfortunate had
used to end his existence. The barrel
of the gun had evidently been held close
to the mouth before the trigger was
pulled with the cord.
All this being plain on the face of it,
the coroner decided that an inquest was
superfluous, pronounced it a case of
suicide and ordered the body taken to
Lake Crystal, where it was prepared for
burial, but is being held until word has
been received from a brother who is.
supposed to live at Rivertown, Wyoming.
Anderson came to Cambria last April
from Minneapolis, where he is said to
have been at work as a laborer. He was.
an industrious young fellow, but never
mingled much with other young folks.
The only topic which he would discuss
with anybody was the European war,
always bringing up the subject whether
or not his native country, Sweden,
would also become involved. Following
such discussions he always became down
hearted and despondent. He was in
one of these moods last Sunday after
noon when he left the house, but no one
ever suspected that he would go to such
extremes to end his worries.
Although no definite information can
be gathered from the effects of the'
suicide, it is known that his parents and
three sisters and two brothers still live in
Sweden and the other brother in Wy
oming.
Mr. Alkire came to New Ulm yesterday
afternoon to deposit the money found
upon the body and in the trunk of the
dead man. There was about $60 in
money and an insurance policy the
latter, however, had not been kept paid
up and is void. Mr. Alkire's version of
the suicide is substantially that given
above.
A call is expected in the near future
from the Democratic county organization
for a convention at which to elect dele-
