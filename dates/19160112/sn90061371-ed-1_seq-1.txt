Old Sssftirale For a Tariff.
In the iwrtion made public
yesterday of his anuusl report
Mr. Kedfieid, the Secretary of
Commerce, predicts that after
the War a preat effort will ha
made by foreiirn countries to re
cover loat commerce.
He asserts that "the outreach
t American industries, n a y,
their very existeuce in our land
in some cases, will be resisted to
the fall." He appears te fear
"dumping" of cheap foreign
Koods in our markets.
Mr. Kedfield is far from sug-L-estintr
the n-buildini of the
Tariff wail to kr-ep them out. He
has an odd and original subac
ute. He would clothe the
Treasury Department and the
Department of Justice with pow
er to confiscate foreign merchan
dise offered here in what they
may deem "unfair competition."
More than this, he recommends
that it he mads unlaw tnl for say
men who age rapidly; it is the
men who stick in old ruts and
follow out long established rules
and methods. Constant change
sad variety may be said to form
one of the great a ec rata of youth

of getting out aa much as possi
