Attorney Cushlng, of Mrs. Mohr c

hurled themselves Into the situation to
prevent further examination along this

"Healls yelled 'stop! There's been

He then told of the arrival f four
other motor parties, of Healls' nervous
agitation and the posture of Mohr in
the touring car. Chaffee brought Miss
Burger to Providence, taking her to
the Rhode Island hospital, but Heells
was compelled to drive the touring car

called a consultation of counsel.
Defense Loses Point.
Attorney Lewis, for the defense, lost
the first skirmish In today's battle
when Judge Stearrui overruled a de
mand for a list of the State's wit
nesses.
Cella M. Cross, of Boston, a profes
sional nurse, who was a member of the
Chaffee motor party, followed Chaffee
on the stand.
"Dr. Mohr was hunched up on tlw
right aide of the tonneau." she said In
leply to Phillips' examination. "He
wore an overcoat, but his hat wsa on
the floor. A woman lay stretched out
on the grass at the n'de of the. road.
Of course, I was very much frightened,
but I ran to her and found she had
been shot In the neck."
Lewis vainly tried to prevent any
reference to the shooting of Miss Bur
ger. He was overruled that the entire
Incident might b recorded.
Miss Cross' piping voice grew even
i... riuttnet when Lewis thundered
nueatlonn at her. but her testimony-
corroborated Chaffee's In the essential
points.

The arsenal at CettinJe already has
been dismantled, and evervthlnir of

were belnc made on Sundav to transfer
the capital, but the new seat of govern

"Th Austrlans are advancing toward

On all fronts, the Austrlans are strik

need of food supplies.
Mount Lovcen fell after five dav of
terrific and uninterrupted bombardment

close range. The bombardment blew
to pieces the flrst line trenches of the

SSACRE
PRESIDENT'S POLICY,
WATCHFUL WAITING,
BITTERLY DENOUNCED
Murder of Seventeen Americans by Bandits Officially
Confirmed, But State Department Takes No Ac-
tion Lansing Blames Victims- Themselves, Be
cause They Disregarded Warnings--Some Sort
of Note Expected.
Armed intervention by the United States in Mexico
was demanded in the Senate today, following the receipt of
official confirmation of the massacre of seventeen American
citizens by Mexican bandits in the Chihuahua district.
The demand was embodied in a formal resolution in
troduced by Senator Sherman of Illinois.
A similar resolution, introduced in the House by Con
gressman Dyer, called upon the President to advise Con
gress whether he does not now beljeve the time has arrived
for intervention.
Both resolutions reflected the intense indignation
which swept over official Washington today when the press
reports of the massacre were confirmed.
, STORM, OF DEBATE.
A storm of debate broke out in the Senate shortly
after t o'clock and the Administration was sharply criti
cised for its policy.
Senator Gallinger of New Hampshire, Republican
leader, declared the time for watchful waiting had ceased.
Senator Borah poured a withering attack upon the
Administration's Mexican policy and denounced it as
"compromising, side-stepping, procrastinating, vacillating,
and un-American."
Secretary of State Lansing, who has called upon the
Carranza government to arrest and punish the perpetra
tors of the deed, characterized the massace as a dastardly
crime.
At the same time the Secretary issueda statementin
which he laid partial blame on the victims of the slaughter,
who "he declared, had failed to heed warnings to keep out
of the parts of Mexico where revolutionists are active.
NO ASSURANCES GIVEN AMERICANS.
He denied that the Americans had been given assur
ances of protection from the State Department, or that the
department had issued passports to the men.
That the Administration will seek to withstand the
pressure for armed intervention appears likely from the
fact that Secretary of War Garrison has received no orders
from the President to prepare his forces along the border
for such action.
It is also regarded as significant of the Administra
tion's purpose, if possible to avoid armed action, that Mr.
Lansing, while deploring the wholesale murder, indicated
that Carranza could not be expected to control absolutely
conditions in districts where revolutionists are carrying on
. guerrilla warfare.
Outside of Administration circles it was expected that
the President would issue a statement of some kind promis
ing to take action, just as he did a week ago when one
American life was snuffed out with the sinking of the Brit
ish liner Persia. The White House, however, was silent.
State Department
Told Americans
Of Mexican Peril
The United States Government to
day served official notice on General
Carranza that It holds him responsi
ble for the Chihuahua massacre, which
resulted in the death of seventeen
persons, mostly Americans.
Secretary of State Lansing announc
ed he had notified General uarranza
thi the United States expects him to
"apprehend and bring to Justice" the
slayers of the Americans.
At tho same time tha State Depart
ment made it plain that no considera
tion whatever Is being given to the
demands for Intervention following
