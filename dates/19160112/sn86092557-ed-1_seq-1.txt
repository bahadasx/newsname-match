REPUBLICAN VICTORY CERTAIN
THIS YEAR, DECLARES BURTON
Ohio Man Has Figures to
Back Up His Asser
tion.
THE
FAILED
They Have Not Kept Prom
ises and They Have Mud
dled Things.
BY THEODORE E. BURTON.
Former Senator From Ohio, ar.d
Leading Candidate for the Re
publican Presidential Nomi
nation.
(Copyright, 1916, by the Newspaper
Enterprise Association.)
For an accurate forecast of the re
sults in 1916 it will be necessary for
a moment to revert to the .conditions
in 1912, which resulted in the election
of President Woodrow Wilson.
j In the first place
it will be recalled
that in the Novem
ber election of that
year President Wil
son received 6,
293,019 votes, The
odore Roosevelt re
ceived 4,119,507
votes and William
H. Taft received 3,
484,956 votes. The
combined vote of
Roosevelt and Taft
was 1,311,444 great
er than that of
Wilson. In short,
Wilson received
some one and a
quarter million less
, , than a majority of
mmwi 1u9?2popuiarvo-^in
The vote received^ 6y President Wil
son In 1912 was moreover not an ac
curate barometer of his strength. His
vote was Increased by the support
of a very considerable number of
progressives ? who ware" deteriflined
that a republican should not be elect
ed, and. by the also considerable num
ber of republicans who preferred that
a democrat should be elected rather
than "a progressive.
The split in the republican party,
the most severe revolution in the
ranks of any political party in the his
tory of the Oulted States, in Itself
explains the election of Wilson. This
wound has today been practically
healed. The causes which occasioned
the division of the party in 1912 have
now disappeared.
The progressive party in Ohio, for
example, In 1914 ceased to exist?

Auto Truck Plunges

FARMER WHO FIGURED IN- SIMI
LAR ACCIDENT INNOCENT
CAUSE
An automobile accident which nar
rowly missed belug fatal, occurred on
the Barrackvllle road yesterday af
terr.nn" when a truck belonging to
driven by Lewis Carskaddon, went ov
er the bank on the grade going from
Ice's Run up the hill toward Barrack
ville. The bank to the right of the
pavement at this place is very steep
and almost a direct drop of 75 feet
to where the declivity ceases.
Carskaddon was driving slowly up
the hill when'he met a farmer driving
a team down the hill, and as he turn
ed out to pass the farmer he drove too
near the edge of the pavement. The
wheels slipped and the truck went
over. The truck turned over and
over and rolled entirely down the
precipice landing at the bottom with
a crash which wrecked it. Carskad
don, however. In some manner fell
into a small holo just below the pave
ment and was unhurt.
The place whore the accident oc
cured was the scene of a similar hap
pening a short time ago when Harry
Clinton, of the Standard Garage, went
over the hill when the car he was driv
ing met the same farmer.
There is an Iron railing along the
pavement just above this place, but
It does not extend the entire length
of the danger zone.
Local Corporations
Reduce Capital Stock
Meetings of the stockholders of the
Shaw Hotel company and the Nuzum
Washed Sand and Supply company
were held today and the officers of
the companys fir the new year elect
ed. It Is likely that the present of
ficers were re-elected but their names
had not been glvon out at press time.
Sam 'R. Nuzum is the president of
both companies, and president of the
Marsh Coal and Coke company which
also held their meeting today.
Resolutions to reduce the capitaliza"
tlon of the Hotel company from $100,
000 to {50,000, and to reduce the capi
talization of the Sand company from
150,000 to JlO.flO, were submitted and
-will probably he pasted.
SENATOR BURTON'S BEST POINTS!
The split In the Republican .party explains the election of Wilson.
This wound has today been practically healed. Its causes have dis
appeared.
The predominant (Democratic) issue of 1912 was the high cost
of living. All the necessities of life cost quite as much today as they
did four years ago.
The tariff legislation resulted in y. ocrlous diminution of revenues.
It threatened the government with financial complications leading to
a deficit in the treasury. The solution was the so-called war revenue
act, for which the outbreak of the war offered a convenient name, but
did not constitute the fundamental cause.
Appropriations have exceeded the expenditures authorized under
the preceding Itepublican regime.
Democratic pledges have not been redeemed.

Austrians Take Montene
grin Stronghold That
Dominates Cettinje.
(By Associated Press)
LONDON, Jan. 12.?The announce
ment of the occupation of Mount
Lovcen in Montenegro although it is
not confirmed from Entente sources,
is generally accepted here as true.
Uneasiness, which is already freely ex
pressed in Italy, is reflected in the
English and French newspapers. The
! loss of.tiOYcen from the point of. view
I of the allies is serious, owing to the
; fact that Its summit dominates Cot
taro bay, the Austrian naval base be
fore Italy entered the war. The French
or guns .on
the mountain and had prepared em
placements" for heavy guns which
could have swept the bay. Austria, by
seizing it, forestalled.this danger and
regard to Cettinje, the capital of Mon
tenegro, which is little over G miles
distance, although sheltered by inter
veiling mountains.
The Austrian advance considering
the distance to be covered was much
slower than that made in the Teu
tonic contest of Serbia but in con
sideration of the formidable obsta
cles which the mountainous character
of the country presents it is conceded
that the Invaders are making steady
progress.
The question is being anxiously rais
ed as to why the Entente allies did
not long ago send aid to the Monte
negrins and in particular why Italy,
which is more acutely affected by this
Austrian invasion, had not taken pre
ventative measures.
The Austrians are now only 10
miles from the capital of Montenegro,
calculating the distance over the ex
isting road, and a successful blow at
the heart of-the country limy have the
effect, it is said by military critics,
of isolating troops who are defending
the northeastern frontier.
[ In Champagne the Germans hold a
slight gain made as a result of the de
I termlned offensive of last Saturday
and Sunday. The French military au
thorities say that the German forces
which delivered the attack lost heav
ily as with three divisions they nd
j vanced in the face of the French ar
tillery fire which took a terrible toll.
From the eastern front it is reported
1 that a comparative lull at present pre
vailed. Special dispatches affirm that
I the Russians have been so successful
In consolidating the new positions
I that the Austro-Germans have begun
to remove the supplies from the bases
which they had established in pre
paration tor the advance which they
Intended to make In the coming
spring.

With the West Fork river at Clarks

It is more than likely that tho Monon

(By Associated Press)
WESTON. W Va, Jan. 12?Much
damago has bean wrought as a result
of the flood which early today threat
ened to assume a most serious aspect
here when the West Fork of the Mon
ongahela river had reached a depth
of G feot in the principal streets, and
was rising 6 inches an hour.
At noon the flood had reached Its
height, although it was not expected
It would fall until night. Reports from
surrounding country told of bridges
being washed away, live stock lost and
much other property damage. Roan
vllle and Glenville, towns along the
little Kanawha, are said to have suf

IThis Bill Was Offset^ Almost
.$3,000 By Fines Col
lected.
The cost of teeding prisoners in the
Marion county jail as shown by reports
compiled today by Assistant Cleric
Phillips under the direction of tho
Clerk ot the County court A. G. Mar
tin for the last year is $11,232.25. Fifty
cents per day is allowed for the feed
ing of each prisoner confined in the
county Jail and 50 cents per day for
each prisoner employed on the county
road gang.
Fines collected in courts of justices
of the peace amounting to J2.S03.47
is used to pay the board bills as far
as it will go of prisoners convicted
of misdemeanors. By using the fines ]
for this purpose the money is kept in I
the county as otherwise it would have I
I to be turned over to the state gov
ernment
For the last quarter inc'/.ding the
months of October, November and
December the cost of the prisoners'
board amounted to $1,943.90 including
$U2G.15 collected as fines
During the preceeding quarter in
cluding July, August and September
the cost of prisoners' board amounted
to $2,021.75, ot which $357 was col
lected as flne3.
During tie quarter including April,
May and June it cost $3,711 to feed
the prisoners In Marion county, 5S22.74
having been collected as fines,
I During the first quarter of the year,,
including January, February and
March, the prisoners' board cost $3,
555.60, of which $1,002.58 was col
lected as fines.
The larse amount of fines collec
ted during the first half of the year
was due largely to the many fines
of $100 each Imposed for violation of
the Yost prohibition law. During the
first and second quarters the numbers
of prisoners in the county Jail was
unusually large, on account of the
many arrests following the strike riot
at Farmtngton.
