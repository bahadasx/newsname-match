WRECK ON SOUTHERN SUNDAY
pna? of Frolght Train Plunge
Through tho Ttrgaloo Illidge.
There were quite a number of Wal
halla citizens who hurriedly got out
their automobiles or "Flivvers" Sun
day and autoed or "Flivvered" over
to the Southern Railway Uridgo
across Tugaloo river near Madison to
view tho wreck of a freight train,
which had plunged through the
bridge. Tho wreck occurred about
9 o'clock.
Through freight train No. 7G, from
Atlanta, was Just about to pass over
the bridge when the engineer noted
that his engine was off tho rails. The
engino wa? so close to the bridge that
the engineer realized that it would
mean certain destruction to suddenly
stop his engino with the long string
of cars pushing against lt, ns this
would probably force his engine and
many cars over the rails and down
over the abutment. He quickly put
on more speed, taking the bridare
with his wheels off the rails, butfror
tunately finding the auxiliary rails at
the side, by means of which ho was
enabled to get his engine and a num
ber of cars over the bridge to safety.

in some manner, however, the first
section of the bridge gave way just, as
the engine cleared the bridge on tho
cpposito side of tho river, and five
'reight cars went down, these being
almost totally demolished. The cars
that went through the bridge were
about tho center of the train. There
was no ono hurt.
It will'be borne time yet-maybe
several days-before regular traffic
can bo carried on ns usual. In the
mean timo all through trains are be

Sections of local trains are being op
erated from Atlanta to the Georgia
side of the bridge and from Char
lotte to the Carolina side, where
transfer of passengers is made by
gasoline boat to accommodate all
local travel.
The scene of the wreck was a mar

wrecking trains from both sides had
reached the scene and were busily at
work clearing away the debris.

CARD TO THE PUBLIC.
I wish to take this opportunity to
kindly express my sincere thanks to
my many friends who so heartily
supported me in tho recent municipal
election.
The almost majority attained by
me certainly Indicates, in plain fig
ures, that the administration for ,the
nrist four years has not been equita
ble to all the people; and If my de
feal will accomplish an improvement
wi oby there will not exist for the
next two years a reversal of that
popular quotation, "Equal rights to
all; special privileges to none," and
enforcement of all laws, both munic
ipal and State, a regularly published
report of all city business, which
every citizen is entitled to, I am sure
my defeat will be a victory, and we
will have a bigger and greater Wal
halla In every way. And lt is only
by such a policy that we can ever
hope to attain an "Ideal" which
every reasonable public citizen cer
tainly wishes to see our community
arrive at. Geo. L. Wilson.

AlilillOS EVACUATE GALLIPOLI.
Tho "Great Ouustnnding Blunder of
War" Filially Abandoned.
London, Jan. 9.-The remaining
positions on Gallipoli peninsula held
by the allies have been abandoned
with the wounding of only ono man
among the British and French, ac
cording to a British official statement
issued to-night.
This news has been expected for
several days, for tho retirement of
the troops from Anzac and Suvla Bay
three weeks ago left no strategic ad
vantage to the retention of the top of
the peninsula. I
Nevertheless, tho news will be re
ceived with a pang of regret by the
people of tho British Isles, as well as
the colonies.
Renewed activity of various kinds
noted by tho Turkish ofllclal commu
nications in the past few days has
presumably been in the nature of
preparations for the final act of the
Dardanelles tragedy. To-night's
Turkish officiai statement covering
the period from Thursday to Satur
day, records Increasing effectiveness
of the reinforced Turkish batteries,
which have been drawing In and con
centrating on the allies' rem a in in g
position.
Battleship Blown Up.
Another pang to the British publie
will be caused by tho announcement
to-night of the loss of the battleship
King Edward VII, which has been
blown up by a mine. The brief offi
cial statement on the incident does
not reveal the scene of tho accident
and merely says that the disaster oc
curred In a heavy sea, despite which
the entire crew was saved before the
Bhlp went down.
The King Edward VII represented
an investment of nearly fl.GOO.OOf,
and was one of the finest of the lo it
class of pre-droadnaughts, corres
ponding in general to the American
ships of the New Jersey and Nebraska
type, and was only slightly older
than the Natal, which was sunk by an
Internal explosion about a week ago.
A Great Disappointment. ,
With the withdrawal of tho British
and French forces from the southern
tip of the Gallipoli peninsula after the
evacuation of the Anzac Cove and
Suvla Bay position on tho western
coast in the middle of December there
has come to an end a movement be
gun with expectations of .achieve
ments which would have a great bear
ing on the outcome of the war. Thou
sands upon thousands of men lost
their lives in effecting landings on the
Turkish coast, and in the fighting In
progress since. In addition a number
of battleships ?nd smaller war cruft
of tho entente allies have been sunk
or damaged.
The chief military purpose of tho
Dardanelles campaign, which was be
gun In February, 1915, with the bom
bardment of Turkish forts at the en
trance to the straits by entente allied
warships, was the capture of Constan
tinople, and the opening of the
Bobphorus so that Russia might have
an avenue tor tho receipt of arms
and ammunition, and also for the ex
portation of grain. For England suc
cess meant the prevention of another
Turkish Invasion of Egypt, and the
permanent safety of the Suez Canal
and England's communication with
India.
Politically a victory was oxpected
to have a powerful effect upon tho
then neutral Balkan States, Greece,
Bulgaria and Roumanla. Thero was
cited tho possibility, now realized by
Bulgaria's entranco into the war, of
preventing the establishment of a
Balkan link between the Central pow
ers ?nd Turkey and also of the possi
ble opening of a land route to India.
Good Guns Saved.
London, Jan. 9.-It is officially an
nounced that the complete evacuation
cf the Gallipoli peninsula has been
successfully carried out.
Tho official communication issued
this evening says:
"Gen. Sir Charlee Monro reports
tho complete evacuation of Gallipoli
has been successfully carried out.
"All the guns and howitzers were
taken away with the exception of 17
worn-out guns, which were blown up
by us before leaving,
"Our casualties amounted to ono
member of the British rank and file
wounded.
"There -were no casualties* among
tho French."

Retrenchment Policy.
Tho determination to hold down
the appropriai lon bill and thc st at o
levy, and, if possible, to reduce it
from the figures or last yeai i ap
parent in tho expressions hoard from
the leaders who are gathering hore
on the eve of tho session. Thoy
seem to bo ready to co-operate with
tho expresBod wish of Governor Man
ning not to proceed with any new
undertakings until the assessments
and burdens of taxation are moro
evenly distributed. There ls no sign
of any attempt to cripple any of tho
Institutions or undertakings which
aro now supported, but t6 give them
what is sufficient, and not to launch
out in new fiele...
The State Tax Commission is com
ing In for a good deal ot attention,
and tho understanding around tho
Capitol to-day was that the Governor
might deal with this subject through
a special message. The members of
the commission will have to go be
fore the Stato Gennie for approval or
rejection.
Foul? Now Faces.
There are four new faces In the
Legislature, ono new Senator und
three new membeis of the House.
Tho Clarendon county seat in the
Senate will be filled by Charlton Du
Rant, lt having become vacant by the
death of Senator Appelt. In the
i loane the seat of Geo. W. Dick, who
esigned to become postmaster at

who served In a previous Legislature.
R. Burton Hicks will go in with tho
Spartanburg delegation in the placo
of W. H. Querry, who rselgned to be
come a member of the tax commis
sion, and J. Terry Wood ls a new
member of the Greenville delegation,
succeeding A. M. Hawkins, who re
signed to teach school.
The necessary legislation for strict
enforcement of the prohibition laws
will probably be enacted, judging
from the sentiment of members -al
ready here. Tho passing of the dis
pensary will do away with the coun
ties paying tho special constables,
and lt will bo necessary for the Gene
ral Assembly to provide a fund for
the payment of special constables for
the enforcement of the prohibition
laws. It has boen suggested that ono
way of doing this would bo to put a
tax of say fifty cents on oach gallon
of liquor ordered in the State. Ano
ther suggestion has boon made to
raise the law enforcement fund of
the Governor to $50,000. f A

(Anderson Mail, 10th.)
Fire destroyed a two-story concrete
block building in Iva this morning.
The building was owned and occupied
by R. S. Yeargin and was situated in
the center of the town.
Just how tho building caught fire is
rather mysterious, as the flames wore?
discovered early in tho morning,
about 4 o'clock. Two other store
rooms adjoining the Yeargin atoro
were threatened and many bales of
cotton which were piled in the yard
also came near burning.
Tho flames consumed the store
room and most of the contents of the
store. Mr. Yeargin conducted a Jew
elry store in the building.
The value of the building is not
definitely known, but Mr. Yeargin had
insurance with an Anderson concern
for $2,500 on the store, $2,000 on tho
stock and $700 on the fixtures.
