Men Assert They Were Sent From
New York to Start Strike to Pre
vent Manufacture of War Munltioni
at Steel Plant.
New Yovk, .lan. 10. Tho federal
authorities Investlsatliu; German ac
tlvttles will inquire Immediately Into
tho status of tho two men under ar
rest at Youngstown, who are said to
have confessed thnt they were sent
from New York to Youngstown to
start n strike.
Youngstown, O., Jan. 10. Tho In
quisition by both federal and Mnhon
lng county authorities into mob vio
lence at (he plant of the Youngstown
Steel and Tube company plant, when
two persons were killed, many
wounded and a million dollars' worth
of property destroyed, took a sensa
tional turn when County Detective
Kane said two Austrlans In tho coun
ty Jail here have made confessions In
which they asserted they were sent
here from New York to start a strike
to prevent the manufacture of war
munitions.
"It would be useless for us to at
tempt to operate our plant while some
of the workers are In their present
frame of mind," J. A. Campbell, presi
dent of the Youngstown Sheet and
Tube company said, discussing the
strike conditions, for the first time
since the riot at the plant In Bast
Youngstown.
"We do not need any protection for
ourselves, but we want to have our
workers and their homes protected.
Brigadier General Speaks has In
formed us that he will remove the na
tional guardsmen from our plant. It
was never Intended that they should
be quartered there.
"We will not Import strikebreakers.
I am confident that outside people
were responsible for the shooting. It
has been suggested that this trouble
was provoked by enemies of the al
lies. They may have been a factor.
Wo have been making war munitions,
and when we started many of the
Austrlans In our employ refused to
work. They may have seized the op
portunity of assisting In this trouble
by Inciting the other men."
Over -100 persons were taken Into
custody In East Youngstown by sol
diers and deputy sheriffs and the an
thorltles are In a quandary as to
where the prisoners were to be kept.
Movements toward a settlement of
the strike at the Youngstown Sheet
and Tube company In East Youngs
town and In Struthers, and the Re
public Iron and Steel company In
Lansingville, where probably 18,000
men are employed with less than
5,000 of thera on strike are started.
