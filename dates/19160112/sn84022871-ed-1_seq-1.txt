to Dean P. McLellan, a Barton man,
who has had several years experience

is one of the few merchants now in

Orcutt, Mr. batchelder continued in
the same store until about seven years
ago, when he purchased the Nelson
bfock and move! his business to its

felt that his other business needed his
full attention and having the opportu
nity to sell to a Barton man, whom he
felt would be a credit to the business
and town, he did so, and with the
business and good will, he bespeaks
for the new owner a large measure of
success and the continued patronage of
old customers as well as the addition of
many new patrons, whom be is sure

RIGHT; MOTIVES.
In determining 'proper motives
of conduct it is easy to perceive
that the higher are more com
mendable than the lower and
that even" an act of justice and
benevolence loses something of
its charm when known to be in
spired by the; selfish desire of
human applause. ;It was the gay
poet of antiquity who said that
concealed" virtue ; differed ' little": 'i
from sepulchered I sluggishness
But this Is a heathen sentiment :
alien to reason and to truth! It "
Is hoped that men -will be hon
est, but from a higher motive
than because honesty Is the best
policy. It is hoped that they
will be humane, but for a nobler
cause than the fame of human
ity. Charles Sumner. ,

Particular as to Diet.
De Quincy, the writer, during the
last 30 years of his life invariably
made his dinner of a slice of mutton
and a dish of rice. He insisted that
the cook cut his meat in a diagonal
rather than a longitudinal form, de
claring that, "otherwise, consequences
incalculably distressing to my system
will arise and will prevent me from at
tending to matters of overwhelming
importance."
Spain's Patron Saint.
St. James the Great is worth noting
as of the company of the Great Twin
Brethren, the Bowmen of Mons and
the Angels of Neuve Chapelle. Span
ish tradition tells how his tody was
miraculously brought to Compostella
and there enshrined, and how the
saint arose and at Clavijo, in 841,
mounted on a white horse, slew 60,000
Moors. Hence the Spanish Order of
St. James of the Sword, Santiago de
Espada.
Chinese Amulet.
One of the commonest amulets
worn by an only son in China is a
small silver lock, according to the
authors of "The Book of Talismans."
The father collects coins from about
a hundred different heads of families,
and has them exchanged for silver,
which is converted into a native pad
lock used to fasten a silver chain
round the boy's neck. This, it is be
lieved, will preserve him from evil
spirits, lock him to life and contribute
to his health and longevity. .
Stark Realism.
, An advance agent for a theatrical
production was speaking to a newspa
per man with reference to the wonder
ful powers of the leading woman. "Do
you know," he said, enthusiastically,
"that in New York when she appeared
as the dying mother in the last act
an insurance man who had written
aer a policy for $10,000 actually faint
ed in the theater.'
Strength Givers.
To seek to' do only the easy things
of life is a foolish and suicidal choice,
for anybody, even a nonentity, can do
these things. Let us care, rather, to
da; hard things, the - overcoming ot
which will bring to us moral strength,
i .: tested fortitude; and a wider ex
perience of tne ' deeper meanings of
duman life. . ,.'.- ' '
His Consolation.
"There's one consolation about be
ing in jail, mum!" "What is it, my
poor man?" "After I once go to bed
nobody here makes me get up and go
down to. be sure that the back door's
locked." Detroit Free Press. ,
