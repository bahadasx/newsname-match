Mercury Goes Down
to Six Below Here
lM night, or rather last evening,
saw Ihe mercury swing lower In Pen
dleton than It has for four years. Six
l low aero was the minimum reach-
d and that point was reached about
; o'clock last evening. After that
Votir the temperature rose several de
crees and at 8 was only two below.
This morning at S It was 2 above sero.
The rise In temperature during the
night was caused by the clouding
ever of the skies. Had the skies re
mained clear, the coldest snap In
many yars would probably have been
tecorded. I Hiring the early morning,
snow began fulling again and It con
tinued until after 10 o'clock, about
two inches In all falling. This after,
noon another light snow began.

Apples Good Food
For Hungry Robin;
Won't Eat Wheat
What shall I feed the robins,
they wont eat w heat or an son
of grain." said a feminine voice
over the 'phone to the East
Oregonian.
The answer to her nuestlon is
that worms and fruit constitute
the robin's diet. According to
W. L. Finley. state biologist, the
thing to do for the robin red
breast Is to give him some fruit,
particularly apples, since there
are no worms available now.
Mf. Finley advises people not
to throw the feed Into the snow
but to clear off the window sill
or some other place and place
the food there.
The snow bird may be fed on
bird seed, crumbs or other food
of that sort.
BORDER IS AROUSED

AMERICAN CITIZENS
Villa Himself is Reported to Have Been in
Charge of Firing Squad That Shot Down 18
Men-Two of Them English-Victims Were
Dragged From Train and Robbed of $25,000

EL PASO, Tex., Jan. 1Z. Official
messages received here tell how 16
Anieriaans and two Englishmen were
dragged from a Mexican Northwest
ern train, robbed of $25,000, stripped
of their clothing ana shot in coll
blood.
News received shows that the mas
sacre was the result of direct orders
given by Villa to kill every Ameri
can and all other foreigners met
With. It is even reported that Villa
himself commanded the firing squad.
The bandits first began to shoot tho
members of the party, one at a time.
Seeing that death was inevitable, sev
eral attempted to run and were shot
down.
Thomas Holmes, an American who
escaped by hiding aDoard the train
says he heard the shrieks of the vic
tims as they were being murdered
Holmes brought the first news to Bl

are expected here today.

The border Is aroused to a fever

their victim'! clothing, the bandits
marched them to a ravine and
slaughtered them.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 1J. IndUrna
tlon swept official circles with word
of the Mexican slaughter. Prompt
action for redress and to prevent any
repetition of the incident has been
started by Wilson and Lansing. Nor
thern Mexico consuls are ordered to
report the details. The United States
will hold Carranza responsible.
The British embassy Inquired re
garding the Englishmen involved in
the massacre and it is expected Eng
land will protest. The state depart
ment expects Carranza to promptly
dispatch troops to seek the murderers
and protect other Americana.
EL PASO. Jan. 12. In helpless
rage the city awaited today the ar
rival of the train bearing the eighteen
lullet-rlddled bodies. Apparently
nothing has been done officially to
ward avenging the massacre. A spir
it of bitterness toward the Wilson ad
ministration ts apparent on everv
band. The fact that Villa and 15 men
were at LaJunta two days ago streng
thened the belief that Villa personal
ly commanded the bandits.
A special train chartered to bear
the bodies will arrive late tonight.
Hundreds of protests have been wired
to Washington demanding Immediate
sett on to effectively safeguard Amer
icana In Mexico. The Guggenheim In
terests have practically decided to
withdraw their employes and close
their Mexican mines.
Further details of the massacre
v.ere not obtainable because of a strict
censorship. It was reported General
Tievino sent an expedition to pursue
the bandits, but the latter have tw
days start and are believed safe In
the mountains.
Villa Is known to have harbored a
Utter hatred of Americans since Car
ranza has been recognized. Authori
ties think he bided his time for just
such an opportnnity to whet his
thirst for revenge.
