BY GEN-
WVs HI XGTOX, Jan. 10. General
Scott, chief of staff, today told the :
house military committee that the j
country must have an army of from j
1,000,000 to 2,000,000 men or m 1
event of war accept disaster. He

"Otir organizations, as far as they .
go, compare favorably with the troops '
of any foreign power," said Scott. A '
school of training is desirable but not
practical because of lack of control
bv the Federal government, the
eral thought.
The administration plan as a
urc of self-defense, he said, was not
proposed in anticipation of war. He j
believed that the organization of a
continental army would not interfere '
with recruiting for the Xational Guard
because the two forces would appeal
to different classes of men. He added '
that training o fthc continentals would
produce better soldiers than docs the
Xational Guard system.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 10. After ten years of legislation and liti
gation, the Supreme court decided that congress finally enacted a con
stitutional law regulating statements regarding the curative effects of
medicines in interstate commerce. Justice Hughes rendered the decis
ion. It is expected numerous actions against drug concerns will follow.
The decision held that the Sherley amendment, enacted in 1912
struck precisely at mis-statements in labels and circulars accompany
ing medicines.

Method Of Expressing
Principle's Is Delaying
Lusitania Settlement
Ey Associated Press.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10. The difficulty of agreeing upon details
is delaying the final Lusitania settlement. The German ambassador
and Secretary Lansing conferred today and later it was said no final
agreement was reached, although the outlook is encouraging. Whil;
the principles involved are virtually agreed upon, it was learned that
until a method of expressing these principles, satisfactory to both sides
is found, announcement of a settlement will be withheld. The word
ing of the tentative proposal submitted by Germany is inadequate in
certain respects.

LOXDOX, Jan. 10. While thc
Russian front is calm, there has been
severe fighting in the other war the
atres. Thc Austrians, despite waist
Jecp snow, havc advanced their posi
tions at several important points on
thc Montenegrin fronts and arc prov
ing themselves the equal of thc Mon
tenegrins in mountain fighting.
The French repulsed four German
attacks in Champagne. Thc Germans,
however, have retained their foothold
in two places in French advanced
trenches.
Thc British en route to relieve Kut-el-Amara.
met with Turkish forces
which were compelled to retire after
heavy fighting.
Pctrograd says Czernowitz is cali,
due to huge' losses and the resultant
demoralization of thc Austrian army.
This is evident from an estimate in a
Hungarian newspaper that thc losses
on both sides in thc Bcssarabian bat
tics exceed 175.C00. This is more
than thc total British losses in thc
Dardanelles campaign. Aeroplane
skirmishes is thc chief event on the
