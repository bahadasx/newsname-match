ROCKEFELLER DENIES
THAT HE IS INTERESTED
Organizer of Federation Says
Riot Was Part of a Scheme
to Lower Stock.
Youngstown, O., Jan. 11.—Fred
Croxton of Columbus, 0., mediator
sent here to adjust' ithe wage disputes
in this district, announced tonight
that the strike of the tube workers at
the plant of the Youngstown Sheet
and Tube company had been declared
off.
The men at a mass meeting tonight
voted to accept the company's offer
or an increase in wages amounting
approximately to 10 per cent, and de­
cided to return to work tomorrow.
The plant employs 9,500 men, not
all of whom have been on strike, al
though they weje compelled to quit
work.
Rockefeller Nt Interested.
Mediator Croxton is endeavoring to
settle the strike at the plant of the
Republic Iron and Steel company and
conferences of representatives of the
company and men will be resumed to­
morrow. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., in
a telegram received late (today, denied
charges made by Thomas H. Flynu,
general organizer of the American
Federation of Labor, that the Rocke­
feller interests were in any way in­
terested in the merger of the hi* in­
dependent steel interests and indi­
rectly responsible for the rioting in
East Youngstown last' Friday.
Says Riot Was Planned.
Mr. ifynn, in his statement, which
was issued here late last night, charg­
ed thai the riot -was part of a scheme
to depress the v/ilueof &.t,ocJt of the
Youngstown Sheet and Tube company
so that control could be obtained and
'a merger effected with several other
companies, in which the Colorado
Fuel and Iron company was to be in
eluded. When the telegram was re­
ceived, Mr. Flynn at once replied that
'he would if Mr. Rockefeller desired,
submit to him the source of his in­
formation.
NEW MIUTARY Bill
President Wilson Meets With
First Opposition on Bill to
Strengthen Army.
Washington, Jan. 11.—The first
definite indication of what a troubled
legislative sea the administration
plan for strengthening the army has
been launched upon came today,
when Chairman (Hay of the house
illilitary committee told 'President
Wilson that he disapproved the fund­
amental program.
The president's reception of this
expression was not disclosed. Sec­
retary Garrison, who framed the ae
ministration's scheme, said he had
no knowledge of what had transpired
at the White House and would not
comment on it. (He indicated, how­
ever. that the attitude of Represent­
ative Hay, before -whose committee
hearings on the bill will be resumed
tomorrow, would not alter the war
department's insistence on the plan
in substance, at least
Representative IHay said that he
favored a passage of a militia pay
bill under a contractual bill with
provisions for state soldiers who
drew pay from the federal govern­
ment which would require them to
serve in the regular army in time of
war. )He also proposed that the pres­
ent organization of the army be
brought up to war strength, which,
he said, would furnish the number
of men thought necessary 'by Secre­
tary Garrison, without any large ad­
dition of officers or increase of over­
head charges.
The plan, which Secretary Garri­
son told the committee, had', the en­
tire approval of President Wilson,
would provide for additional regular
army organization to bring the total
force up to 14)1,000, as compared, ap­
proximately to 100,000 at present.

Chicago, "Jan. 11'.'—'fhe
party will hold its national conven­
tion June 7, in. Chicago, concurrently
with the national convention of the
republican party, in the hope that
both may agree on the same candi­
date for prpsidfent. This action was
decided" upon today by the national
committee of the Progressive party.
'Forty-seven of the 48 states were
represented at the meeting.
Before adjourning the committee
adopted a declaration of principles
in Avhich the administration of presi­
dent Wilson was criticized for its al­
leged failure to deal with adequacy,
national honor and industrial welfare,
and the progressive party went on
record as favoring preparedness, con­
sisting of a military armament as
well as a mobilization of the coun­
try's resources, with a view of its
unification of its citizenship.
A message was read from Col. The­
odore Roosevelt, nrging the necessi­
ty for adequate preparedness, which
was enthusiastically applauded.
Progressive leaders declared there
would be no amalgamation with the
republican party, even if the both
parties choose the same presidential
candidate. The progressive party
plans to nominate a national ticket
at its convention in June.
Many of the party leaders declared
that if the republicans will nominate
Roosevelt or any other man who is
regarded as unobjectionable, and will
incorporate in its platform the sali­
ent features of the Progressive prin­
ciples, both parties will unite on the
same candidates in Chicago next
June.

CROSS EXAMINE
Young Salesman's Story Remain#

of Questions.
TWO MORE WITNESSES
TO APPEAR FOR STATE
"Iron Man" Remains Unmoved
as Father of Murdered Wife
Takes Stand.'
Minneapolis, Jan. 11.—For five
hours today Charles D. Etchison bore
up under a fusilade of questions by
M. C. Brady, chief counsel for Freder­
ick T. Price, a Minneapolis business
man, on trial for the murder ol' his
wife.
When cross examination was com
pleted tonight, Etchison's story that
Price pushed his wife from a cliff and
then stoned her to death, with a view
to inheriting her fortune, remained
unshaken.
Threats, intimations, sarcasms and
the most grilling questioning that at­
torneys for the defense could devise
failed to tear down the web of in
criminating evidence that has been
woven about the defendant. The
young salesman of Washington met
the onslaught with calm answers as
he sat steeled in the witness chair
and foced the hundreds of eager spec­
tators.
Slate to Complete Case.
When court adjourned, it was an­
nounced that the state has but two
more witnesses to testify before com­
pleting its case. It is probable that
the fate of the defendant will be
known before the close of the weak.
Mrs. Price's father, David H. Frid
ley, after whom the town of Fridley,
Minn., is named, followed Etchison on
the stand. As he hobbled to the chair
his eyes fell upon the defendant, and
it was with difficulty that the old
man was prevailed upon /to compose
klhnseif. He finally testified regard­
ing large sumB of money which he
BQid he had given to his daughter, a
present of $10,000 in bonds having
been placed in her hands the day be
fore death.
Through it all, Price, the so-called
"iron man," sat unmoved taking in
every -word and occasionally taking
notes.
Court of Last Appeal in Base
ball World Goes Out With
New Truce.
Philadelphia, Pa., Jan. 11.—The
resignation of Garry Herrmann of
Cincinnati, chairman of the National
commission and the dissolution of the
commission, which has been the
court of last resort for baseball af­
fairs since 1904, will come with the
final disposition of all matters relat­
ing to the peace agreement between
organized baseball and the Federal
league, according to information re­
ceived here from an authoritative
source.
Both the American and iNational
leagues favor the plan to do away
with the tribunal and it has become
known that had the peace terms been
finally settled at the time, the recent
meeting in Cincinnati would not have
been the final one.
The fact that the members of the
commission, which is composed of
Ban Johnson, president of the Amer­
ican league John K. Tener, presi­
dent of the 'National league, and Gar­
ry 'Herrmann, had the dissolution of
the body in view delayed their re
organization of the commission for
another year.
In view of the many difficult prob­
lems which might develop, however,
with the demise of the -'Federal
league, it was thought best to go on,
and the old officers were re-elected
for another .term.
An amicable agreement has "been
reached and the dissolution of the
commission will occur before the
close of another championship sea­
son, it is stated on the highest au­
thority.

By THEODORE E, BURTON.
Tho present European war' has
aroused in the United States a strong
feeling of interest in the South Amer­
ican countries. Th wiir abroad has
shown us that we of the western con­
tinent possess common interests quite
apart from those of Europe, and these
will tend to draw us jjhk:1i -closer to
those other nations of this hemi­
sphere whose aims and ambitions are
so closely akin to ottr own. Last
summer, I spent several months in a
tour of South America 'in Un effort to
learn more of those countries, to be­
come better acquainted with their
people, and to promote us best I could
better relations between us.
In spite of these tietf which should
bind the nations of South America
to the United States, the fact re­
mains that in the past -century there
have been many misirudcrstandings,
due to differences in race, traditions
and language, ascribabte also to that
distrust which smaller countries al­
ways feel toward a larger and more
powerful nation, situated in geogra­
phical proximity. The v/orst obstacle,
however, has been the fact that the
people of North and South America
have not properly understood each
other.
LATIN AMERICANS A
REMARKABLE PEOPLE.
We of the United States are essen­
tially ignorant of the conditions and
the people south of the Canal Zone.
We do not realize what a remarkabie
people they are. They on the other
hand have always cherished a grave
fear of what they have sometimes
called the 'North American Peril. They
have not understood correctly our at­
titude with reference to the Monroe
Doctrine, and have felt that under its
provisions we were seeking to exer­
cise a suzerainty or ovcrlordship over
them. Fortunately, however, they
have cope gradually totalize thajt
'we hav« no such amirtcropr TUat sus­
picion lias disappeared and the South
American nations are now willing to
cooperate with us.
There are sentimental and practi­
cal reasons why we should be bound
in closer harmony with them. We
both belong to the same America. Wo
are working out the same destiny,
and solving the same problems of
popular government. Our country
was the first to recognize their inde­
pendence when they were struggling
for freedom from Spain. Today they
need our capital and our assistance
for their proper development. We
need their products of raw materials,
and they need our manufactured ar­
ticles.
Tho people of the United States
do not realize, even vaguely, what a
wonderful group of nations comprise
South America, and how advanced
and prosperous are their people. Bue­
nos Aires, the metropolis of Argen
-titmf has a population of two million
people, and is as large for example,
as Chicago. It compares in brillance
and splendor with Vienna and Brus­
sels, and even with Paris. When I
was there, I did noC see a single beg­
gar in the streets of that city. Indeed
it has no slums. The Buenos Aires
opera house is a marvel of architec­
ture and splendor, and its people
heard many of the greatest opera
singers of Europe even before we
heard tliem in New Yoik city. Its
hotels rival any to be round in the
United States and it has one club V)f
a membership of two thousand, in
which the initiation fee is llSKIjD in
gold. It has also a subway system,
equal, if not superior to that' of New
York city.
LATINS AMBITIOUS
AND PROGRESSIVE.
The people of South America are
extremely attractive. Their hospital­
ity and kindness are proverbial. They
are progressive and ambitious. Even
the richest people have large families
of children, frequently as many as
ten, and they have no sympathy with
our ideas of race suicide. In Argen­
tina voting is compulsory, and any
one -who fails to cast his ballot is pun­
ished by a fine. South American con­
stitutions are 'based upon that of the
United States, and some of them may
be said to be an improvement upon
our own. Contrary to the general be­
lief, the greatest danger I experienced
on my long trip in South America was
not from wild animals, or from pesti­
lential diseases, or from bullets, but
from the reckless manner in which
they handled automobiles. They have
no speed limits.

BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA, WEDNESDAY MORNING, JANUARY 12, 1916 (BY ASSOCIATED PRESS)
Closer Relations Should Exist Between United States
and Latin American Nations, Declares Senator Burton
opinion that South, America is being
widely colonized by Germany. As a
matter of fact, most South American
immigrants are Spanish and Italian.
Very few Americans have emigrated
to those countries, and this in itself,
explains in large measure, the reason
why we are so unfamiliar with the
VMH
conditions which prevail there. In
Buenos Aires for example, there are
forty thousand English, thirty-five
thousand Germans, thirty thousand
French and only four hundred Ameri­
cans. It is not remarkable therefore,
that we have made very little prog­
ress in developing trade with South
American countries.
El Paso, Jan. 11.—Seventeen per­
sons, all believed to have been Amer­
icans, were killed by Mexican bandits
yesterday after being taken from a
Mexican .Northwestern train, 50 miles
north of Chihuahua City, and stripped
'©f tlieir iolthlng, aedcrding' to "ft mes­
sage received tonight by A. G. Myles,
British vice consul here, from British
Consul Scovell at Chihuahua City.
The train on which the Americans
were travelling from Chihuahua City
to Cusihuiriacnic, Chihuahua, carried
thousands of dollars in currency and
a large quantity of supplies sent by
the American Smelting and Refining
company to its mines in Cusihuiriac­
nic.
It is believed here that all of the
17 American mining men, known by
means of a check on Mexican oass
port's to have been in Chinuahna City,
were on board the looted train.
Thos. H. Holmes, the only known
survivor, however, in his brief tele­
gram giving the first news of the raid,
that he counted but lti Americans
taken from the train.
It is supposed the bandits belonged
to the forces of General Jose Rodri­
guez, a Villa supporter known to be
operating in Chihuahua against the
de facto government.
(Almost immediately after the first
news of the raid was received, a cen­
sorship was imposed on the wires be­
tween Juarez and Chihuhua City by
the Carranza officials. This action
was taken, it' was said, "until the
story could be verified from official
Mexican sources."
According to brief mesages receiv­
ed here, the train bearing the Ameri­
cans was stopped by the bandits at
about fifty miles west of Chihuahua
City, the mining men taken from the
train, robbed, stripped nude, and lin­
ed up along the cars for execution.
Holmes, it is said, was on the extreme
end of the line. As the firing squad
detailed by the bandit leader took po­
sition, it is reported, Holmes broke
away and fled into the desert for liis
life. With feet and body cut and
bleeding from the stones and sharp
cactus, he ran without looking back
until he no longer heard the whistle government soldiers had been refused.
Late Reports Say Chinese Revolu­

San Francisco, Jan. 11.—Chinese
government troops in the province
of Huen and the city of iNankin, the
former capital of the province of Ki

and revolutionists in Fukien and Hu­
nan provinces have proclaimed their
independence, according to cable ad­
vices received here today from
Shanghai by Tong King Onong, pres­
ident of the Chinese Republic associ­
ation. So far, the message said,
President Yuan Shi Kai's forces have
not appeared to resist the revolution­
ists' progress.

Reports from El Paso that a num­
ber of Americans were killed west of
Chihuahua will, if confirmed, result in
urgent representations by the United
States to Cari-anza to increase his
force to capture Villa or destroy his
forces. No official advices regarding
the affair have been received and the
1
officials were hopeful that the reports
received in El Paso by the Smelting
and Refining company might prove
enmeous.
All Americans reported killed were
residents, either of EI Paso or Ari­
zona, with one exception, A. C.
Pringle, of San Francisco, being
among the number.
Dispatches tonight stated that the
bodies were enroute to Juarez.
Confirmation of the news of the
tragedy tonight was made by officials
here of the Carranza de facto govern­
ment.
Confirmation of the shooting of
Maurice Anderson, a clerk, one of the
party, was received tonight. It was
a brief message from his father, Rol
land Anderson, at Chihuahua City, to
his another, reading:
"Maurice is no more. Hope to se­
cure his body."
A protest was circulated among
mining men gathered iji excited
groups in hotel lobbies tonight. The
protests

addressed to President
Wilson and signed by mining men in
hundreds prepared to enter Chihua­

the protection of the de facto govern­

the mining camp, a guard of de facto
eral Leung Tsai Kwang, commanding
the province, to surrender or leave

Shanghai and Hong Kong, Mr. Tong

making rapid progress under the rev­

"Tow Yuan," or "punish Yuan."

Opposition to the government's

The Irish nationalists today an­
nounced abandonment of their oppo­
sition in view of the fact that the
bill does not apply to Ireland. John
Redmond, the veteran home rule
leader, who made this announcement,
shared the most prominent position
in the day's debate with his own en­
emy, Sir 'Edward Carson, who in a
fiery speech, declared that Ireland
ought to be included in the bill,'
Wants to Include Ireland.
Sir Edward rose to speak as soon
as Mr. Redmond ceased.
"I welcome the announcement
which has just been made," he said,
referring to !Mr. Redmond's with­
drawal of the Irish nationalists' oppo­
sition, "but it would have been bet­
ter if the honorable gentleman had
allowed Ireland to have been includ­
ed. In my heart, I believe that when
the hour of victory comes, as it cer­
tainly will come, we, who are Irish
men, will feel the deepest ahame to
remember that we expected others to ff|
make sacrifices from which we prth 'S|
vided our own exclusion."
Reviewing the history of the war,
Sir Edward Carson declared lack
of men had been the chief reason for
the failure in the Dardanelles and
Serbian expeditions. "The teet 14"
he urged, "we cannot win the war
without this bill."
