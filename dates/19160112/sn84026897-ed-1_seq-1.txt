Newsy Letter From Edgef?eld
Graded and High Schools.
I am sure no one enjoyed the
Christmas holidays more than the
school children and the only sorrow
was the thought of school opening:
again on the third. Now that we
are back at work, let as go to it
with a will always accompanied by
a smile, even if school does last un
til the fourth of June.
. On Friday night, January 7,
1916, Miss Helen Dorn entertained
the senior ciass of which she is a
member, very royally. The spacious
hall and parlor were artistically
decorated in pink and green, the
class colors; and, although the
weather was very unpleasant outside
the'guests forgot about it in their
excessive enjoyment. The amuse
ment for a time consisted in a con
test entitled, "Lovers in the kitch
en." The lucky couple was Anua
bel Saunders and Glover Tomp
kins, the prize being a dainty hand
embroidered towel. " The booby
prize which was a apooon fell to
Harrison Parks. After this several
very amusing games were played,
and then the hostess ushered the
guests into the dining room, a per
fect labyrinth ot flowers, where a
most delicious salad course and
sweet course was served^ When we
speak of a senior, we think of a
person who is too dignified to
laugh, but I can assure you thai:
these seniors laid aside their digni
ty, gave vent to their feelings and
enjoyed themselves as much as a
set of "rats" would have done.
All the teachers of the graded
and high school are delighted to
see the interest which the student*
are taking in a set of new encyclo
pedias purchased by Mr. Lyon. This
is a very valuable set of books and
(he improvement in the students
from the use of them can readily
be detected.
The music club met with Miss
Margaret May Monday afternoon, j
January 10. All members were J
?nusual^ntlSilt'.11 TbreTo1^he~mo8t t
enjoyable numbers were instrument- (
al solo?? by Misses Margaret May, ,
Helen Dorn and Ruth Lyon. After .
the program a delicious sweet course
was served. ?
On Wednesday morniug, January
19, the ladies of the ?J. D. C. are
going to have some special exercis- ,
es in connection with the regular j
chapel exercises at the high school. (
This celebration is given in memory j
of Lee aud .1 ackson, and will be one
of interest as well as value to the
students. The public is cordially in
vited.

CLEMSON COLLEGE.
Bright Edgefield Boy Writes
Interesting Letter. Second
Term Begun. New Y. M.
C A. Building.
If you see fit to give me some
space, I will attempt to write a few
lines for your good old paper.
All of the boys that are coming
back for the remainder pf the ses
sion have arrived, and you oan im
agine what we have been doing this
week. Each of us has been rela
ting to our best friends and pals
what a grand time we had during
the holidays, and each one declares
that he has had the nicest time.
After this week we all will begin
the second term proper and lay aside
the pleasant recollections that we
have in mind now of the past holi
days. But some thoughts will be
impossible for we . Clemson boys to
lay aside, and those are about our
best girls, whom we spent many
pleasant hours with while at home.
This is leap-year now though, and
possibly we won't have to write so
many letters to the girls, as they
will write us. We had good news
from our sister college, Winthrop,
during the past week. The girls
over there said it was their year
now and they could afford to write
a good many letters. Now watch
the letters flow to Clemson for the
remainder of the session.
t
We have lost a good many boys
during the holidays. Almost every
section marcher of the under-class
men is carrying a card to be sign
ed by the different professors to get
an honorable discharge for some
one who dropped out during the
holidays. We certainly miss some
of our classmates who were so un
fortunate as no*- to come back. We
miss them almost as much as when
a member of the family at home
goes j>ff for "^vnH^g^ flfjiftlfi, .aa
I'residenl Higgs said, ''some of
;he under classmen's work during
,he first term bas not been so satis
factory as those of the preceding
; wo or three years." This ineffi
ciency is probably partly due to
inefficient preparation in the home
jchool. A student makes a great
mistake in undertaking collegiate
ivork before he is prepared for it,
t>y doiug so he is over-worked most
jf his time and disappointed by
Failures a good many times.
Well, I believe about the latest
ind newest thing for Clemson is
the new Y. M. C. A. building,
which was opened for inspection by
the students and all of the residing
people on the hill, Friday afternoon,
January 7. I feel sure it came up
to and above every one's expec
tation.
A movement was put on foot to
get this handsome new building a
little over a year ago. Mr. Roce
feller donated $50,000 towards this
handsome new building upon condi
lion that the resident members and
students would raise $25,000, which
was soon raised. The building was
begun early last spring. Mr. Coth
ran of Greenwood had the contract.
He is an old graduate of Clemson.
The building is said to be one of
the most modern of it's kind in the
country, and in a few weeks I guess
it will be one of the most modernly
equipped also. Ie contains four
floors including the basement In
the basement is a modern resturant
and soda fountain. Now you can
easily imagine how we boys will
enjoy eating for a few weeks, or at
least until we become broke.
I believe this is all of the news
with us at the present, and I don't
want to impose on the good nature
of your readers now, hence I will
draw to a close for this time.
Best wishes and new year greet
ings.

Concerning Report of Board of
Charities and Corrections.
"The greatest need of our county
institutions is a deepened interest,
intellect, aggressive, sympathetic,
on the part of the local public," the
State Board of Charities and Cor
rections asserts in regard to jails,
chaingan&rs and almshouses in its
first annual repoit to the general
assembly.
The institution officials nfed sym
pathetic help, the report continues,
and many of them wise guidance.
Captions criticism may effect spas
modic improvements, but intellect,
continued co-operation will yield
more. These officials are at fault a
good many times; they get into ruts,
they neglect, they become hardened,
and they need the spur that comes
from public inquiry.
In its report the board sounds a
warning lest the interest taken by
the public in jails,, chaingangs and
ilmshouses become more sentiment
al unproductive sympathy for the
prisoners, convicts, or paupers. The
board declares that sympathy for
:hese classes has its place as long as
society permits the existence of
conditions of which they are so
largely the product; but unless this
sympathy leads to constructive, ag
gressive steps to better conditions
ander which the prisoners, convicts
ind paupers live, it9 very useless
?ess condemns it.
It is one of the primary functions
>f the local committee of visitors
.bat the board is appointing in ecch
jouncy to awaken public interest in
.he county penal and charitable in
itiations be visiting themselves and
akiug others to visit them. The,
nembers of the local committee of
visitors in Edgefield county will be
lamed soon.

HARDY'S HAPPENINGS.
Many Suffering From Epidemic
of Grip. Making Quilt For
Orphans. Visitors Come
and Go.
Several days of our new year
have passed, but not so many, bot
what we may still say happy new
year and may it be a healthy and
prosperous year for every one. So
far we have had some lovely weath
er but Saturday and Sunday were
somewhat cold. As a doctor said on
Friday, "mighty good pneumonia
weather." Dr. R. L. McKie's whole
family except the doctor and Miss
Marjorie, have been in bed 2 weeks
with the grip and now the baby.
Lois, has pneumonia. There seems
to be a great deal of grip all around
us. Mr. and Mrs. Joe Bunch, Mr,
and Mrs. Milton Barker have been
sick with it but are up again: This
seems to be a very malignant type
of grip. It is raging in North Aa*
gusta also in Augusta. Just here we
were rejoiced to see Miss Carne
Ransom on tho street Saturday
while in town. Also we met Miss
Beatrice Stevens who reports a
most delightful visit to Tennessee, a
glorious Christmas. Says she is go*
ing again in the good old summer
time.
Since our last writing we amend
ed the W. M. U. meeting at Mr.
L. W. Reese's. Had quite a nice
gathering, every one in good spirits
with the Christmas oheer. Decided
to have our next meeting Thursday,
the 20th at Mrs. Ellie Briggs' sod
take a lunch and quilt the orphan's
quilt that the ladies have made the
squares for. We hope to have a
full attendance so as to get Ute
quilt finished that day.
We wjre grieved to lose our
neighbor and friend, Mrs. Ivy De
Laughter and do . sympathize mott
deeply with Mr?. DeLaughter and
hi*"DOOK 'itt!* children. Oh. he?
death wa? certainly sad.
We were" so glad to hear that.
Mrs. Lilly DeLaughter decided not
to move back over in her borne
place in "the corner" Mi's Ivy De
Laughter's death decided her not to
move back here which we think is
wise.
Mr. and Mrs. John DeLaughter,
Jr., visited Mrs. DeLaugbter's
aunts, the Misses Lanier, and Mrs.
M. H. Shaw, also attended her
auut, Mrs. Ivy DeLaughter's funer
al and went on to Belvedere to vis
it ber father, Mr. James Matthews,
and sister, Mrs. Burton, returning
home the 2nd of January.
Mr. Herbert Bunch returned on
December 30, from a most delight
ful visit of a week to his cousins,
the Ushers of Quitman, Ga. He re
ports that to bd a rich country and
gives credit to the farmers for being
more industrious than in our sec
tion. He saw plowing going on all
along the railroad up until sun down
on Christmas eve. Monday morning
thej were at it again as though it
were planting time in spring. Says
the people have nice homes, farms
are well taken care of and almost
all have from one to two or three
machines whioh goes to show they
are well off. The roads are like
streets. Beautifully graded, rolled
hard and drained to perfection. Be
ing highly delighted with the peo*
pie and country, Mr. Bunch says be
would like to visit there in the
spring. It is just 8 miles from the
Florida line.
We were sorry to hear of the ill
ness of Mrs. Sam Gardner, Sr., also
Mr. Hugh Gardner and hope they
will soon be up again, also Mn.
Lew Reese and Mrs. Luther Reese.,
Hope Miss Lena Lanham has got
ten well enough to return to Coker
college ere this. We hope Mrs. Sal
lie Bunch will soon be well again*
Hardy's.
Bond Issue Practically Wasted,
Only five or six years ago Marion
county issued $100,000 worth of
bonds and with the money built a
system of roads which were ac
claimed among the best in the state.
Yet the Marion Star reports that
these highways are being ruined
from pure neglect. That is the troub
le generally in th,ese matters. There
is no use to spend money building
roads unless some systematic plan
is devised for keeping them in con
dition. If the legislature will pro
vide for a state highway commis
sion such a pian will be forthcom
ing.-News & Courier.
