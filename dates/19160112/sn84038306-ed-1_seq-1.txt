LUTHER TRiPP.
Luther Tripp, one of the widely
known farmers of Coffins Grove
township, passed away at the home
of his daughter, Mrs. Charles Keiser,
on Monday evening, death being
caused from a gradual break down,
incident to old age. Mr. Tripp had
been toiling gradually, and about a
week ago he and his wife came to
Manchester and has been spending
the week with their daughter and
family.
Mr Tripp was born near Ontario,
Canada, October 23rd, 1838. At the
age of fourteen years he came to the
United States, coming at once to
Delaware county, and located on a
texry
in Coffins Grove. On April 28th,
1669, Mr. Tripp was united in mar
riage with Miss Lucinda Parson, of
near Strawberry Point. All of their
married life was spent on the farm
in Coffins Grove township. Four chil

Kalispel, Montana Mrs. Charles Kei
ser, of Manchester, and Mrs. George
Martin, of Thorpe. Mr. Tripp is sur

Rev. C. K. Hudson, pastor of the
Methodist Episcopal church of this
city, will conduct the services. In
terment will be made in Oakland
cemetery.
Mr. Tripp's death marks the close
of a useful life. He was a man who
"was highly respected by his neigh
bors and old friends. In all of lis
dealings he was considerate of otli)
ers, and when those in need or dis
tress appealed to him for help, he
proved himself a real friend and
true neighbor.
In his death the wife suffers the
loss of a faithful husband, the chil
dren a kind and loving father, and
the community which was his home
for so many years, loses an upright
flithen.

contain three cars for display pur
poses, and the main business office.
Off from the main office are two
supply rooms, where are kept a large
stock of tires and accessories of ev

conveniently situated in the building
off from the main driveway. In the
rear of the building is located the
repair shop. This department is in
charge of competent workmen, and is
equipped with modern machinery.
Messrs. Jones extend a cordial in

SCHOOL NOTES.
Roscoe L. Bowman.
The M. H. S. basketball team de
feated the Monticello team 31 to 17,
last Friday evening in the high
school gymnasium. The largest crowd
which has attended a game this year
was there and there was a great
deal of "pep" and enthusiasm in fav
or of thee local team.
A double-header was played last
Friday evening in the high school
gym between the Monticello team
and the. local boys, and between the
Greeley girls' team and the girl's
team, of the M. H. S. The game was
a walkaway for the home team, the
final score being 57 to 1.
The next basketball game to be
played by the boy's team will be with
the Anamosa team at that place on
Friday night, Jan. 14. They are said
to have a pretty fast team, but we
expect to show them that the team
from Manchester is a little better
than they are.
The third number of the lecture
course was presented on the even
ing of the fifth by the Smith-Spring
Holmes orchestra.
School was opened after the holi
day vacation with many improve
ments in the building. All the floors
had been varnished, new blackboards
had been installed and other things
had been changed and improved.
Rev. Billingsby gave a short ad
dress to the students of the high
school on Friday afternoon, last week,
in which he told of the advantages cf
a college pduca*i~n and especially cf
a smaller college. He believed that
all students should have a college
course. His interesting address was
certainly well received.

Walker, and Secretary Geo. H. Barr,
have not spared any efforts to sup
ply an array of talent that will bring
practical and helpful suggestions to
the farmers of the county. The pro
gram is well balanced. On it appear
the names of men and women who
aro known far beyond the bounds of
this state. It has been fully demon
strated in the past that the farmers
of Delaware county appreciate good
things. During the last two years
when the sessions were held in the
Central opera house, as high as 1,
200 people attended some of the ses
sions. If the programs at former in
stitutes could attract such crowds,
certainly this year's program will do
the same. The new Armory, while
far from completed as yet, is being
fitted up for the convenience of the
people who will attend the sessions.
The large auditorium is steam heat
ed, and chairs will be provided for
everyone.
Following is the program in full:
