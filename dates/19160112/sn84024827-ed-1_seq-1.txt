MURDERED
Mining Men Returning to

De Facto Government is Cen
sured for Lack of Protection
Three Arizonans Suppos
ed to Have Lost Lives.
EL. PASO. Jan. 11. Seventeen Am
ericans returning to their mining camp
in Chihuahua, were taken from the
train fifty miles west ' or Chihuahua
City by bandit?, supposedly led by
Genera' Jose Rodiiguez, stood naked
along the train only one escaped to
tell in surmise what happened to the
others. ' '
The men were employes of the Cusi
huiriachie Alining Company and travel
insr under promised military protection j
of the defacto government of Mexico j
with a trainioad of supplies and thou-
sands of dollars in currency. The first
intimation of the raid came in a brief
telegram from Thomas Holmes, the on-1
ly known survivor, to officials of the
American Mitring and Refining Com
pany here. Almost immediately the i
censorshio was imposed on the wires
between Chihuahua and Juarez by Car
rsnzp officials "until the story could
he verified from official sources."
According to local mining" men,
Holmes, in a brief statement, contain
ed enough to brand the raid as one of
the most atrocious in the last four
years of the revolution in Mexico. It

miles vest of Chihuahua "City, yester
day, where presumably there were one
thousand troops of the Carranza gov
ernment in addition to hordes not kept
lately by the surrender of Villa forces.
According to Holmes' cryptic tele
gTeni, he left the end of the line as the
firing squad took position at the oppo
site end: They raised their rifles and
Holmes started a life race for Chihua
hua City. He heard the shooting. Bui-'
lets swished past. He ran until out ot
sound of the firing. Among those
possibly in the party were three Ari
zonans. They were Alexander Hall of
Douglas, Jacob Hase and Charles Wad
leigh. According to advices from the Brit
ish consul at Chihuahua City' seven
teen were killed: Confirmation of the
rthooting of Maurice Anderson, a clerk
and one of the members of the party,
vas received in a message from the
father to the mother reading, . "Mau
rice is no more. I hope to recover his
body."
Mexican Consul Garcia said he had
heard reports of the killing, but had
received no advices.
Holmes reached Chihuahua City last
night Apparently his only thought
was of his wife, presuming the news of
the affair had reached the border. He
sent a message to the mining company
requesting that his wife be advised he
was safe. The message caused anxie
ty for Holmes had been on the train
scheduled to leave Chihuahua City for
the camp.
Before telegraphic censorship was
imposed on communication, it was es
tablished that other mining men of
Chihuahua City and other Americans
on the train had been killed.
News of the raid caused consterna
tion among the mining men's families,
most of whom reside In El Paso. Gar
cia declined to accept the suggestion
that he telegraph to General Trevino
for information. He stated at the con
sulate that no report of the killing had
been communicated to Carranza be
cause it would be "useless."
The killing of employes is taken to
mean the alleged order of Villa, issued
upon his return from Sonora, after his
family arrived In Cuba, was to be obey
ed. The alleged order to "kill Ameri
cans, loot and burn," has been reiter
. ated by bands returning from Sonora.
It is believed this order resulted in the
recent death of Peter Keane, a book
keeper of the Hearst interests near
Mfdera. at the he.nds of Villa bnndits.
