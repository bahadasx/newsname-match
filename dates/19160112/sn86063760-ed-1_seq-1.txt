East Youngstown and Struthers, s
Ohio, the two days of tranquility t
after the rioting Friday night, which
cost two lives and a million dollar
property damage, having led offi
cials to believe that the situation C
was well under control. C
State troops continued on duty s
Sunday in the strike district. It was t
estimated that twenty-five thousand
sightseers from nearby points in
Ohio- and Pennsylvania thronged the e
run lined streets of East Youngs- c
town. Special trains brought many
persons..

to have participated In the looting of

ltwo h dred and fifty foreigners

articles every description found in
their holes were carried to -the
Youngstown police station. These s
articles, the police allege, were v
stolen from stores attacked by the F
mob.
All available room in the county h
jail in Youngstown has been filled n
with prisoners and plans are being E
made to place others in a large room L
in the Court House under guard.
A crowd of men and women gath- t:
ered at the east Youngstown end of S
the bridge at the company's plant ,
Friday morning and jeered the work- a
men as they crossed. Suddenly a
shot was fired and guards, taking t4
this as a signal, fired over the heads E
of the crowd. The mob replied, and ,
another volley came. A number of t
persons, including two women, fell to a
the street and the mob broke and y
ran up the hillside. 1I
A block away they re-formed and si
almost immediately set Are' to the .
building occupied by the tube com- a
pany's employment bureau. A little
later they fired a small warehouse.
and then turned their attcatien .tc
private property.
A saloon stood on the corner and
a rush was made for the door. In a
minute a shouting crowd filled the
little room and helped themselves to
what they saw. then the looting
was complete the match was applied. ti
A, qlthing store nearby was next t3
entered and the stock passed out to v
the constantly growing crowd in the c(
street by those inside. Clerks fled cc
for their lives and when the looting n,
was linish'd; the place was fired, a]
By this time the mob was in a t]
frenzy. Liquor idspassed around
as freely as water, and those who t
had no cups dipped it -up in the
hollows of their hands, for within b,
half an hour 'other saloons had
been looted and the fire was si
spreading rapidly A
The main street parallels the rail- b
road tracks at the foot of the hill h
and streets led out of it up the hill P
to the residence ' 'eit. For fully ul
-an hour- or mored. e.mob was con- e
tent with the small shops and sa- a
loons on the s'de stieets but then It 0
turned its attention o more preten- el
tfous qtores.
* The mob had lost all semblance ofi
leadership and splitting up into bands
the looters went madly about the p
-work of destruction. Saloon after di
saloon was broken into, looted and o]
fired, flames spreading to the other et
business blocks on the street. Fanned m
by a strong wind the fire tore its ni
way up the hill and- many residences, fr
some occupied *b ythe rioters, were
burnedz. b
~Mayor Cunningham and his ten .cc
policanien realized the sittiation was iz
beyond them and gathered at the tc
police statio:i. Sheriff Umstead had st
been blineded temporarily by a red y
pepper thrown in his eyes by a riot- ti
er.. Later the mayor and sheriff con- Y~
ferred and a call was sent for state ci
troops.
- Meantime the rioting had been In O
progress for several hours, and it y
was seen that the business section st
could not be saved. Every minute a:
the crowd seemed to grow until there ri
were hundreds of drink-crazed men f
and women roaming the streets. The b<
fire department had been called out T
at the first alarm but the hose was n
quickly cut to pieces and helpless
they called on the Youngstown fire it
department. b:
Chief Joseph Wallace had men and ti
equipment ready to send from the &i
city, but found was useless to risk ti
lives and property as long as the w
mob had the town. Scenes of the al
wildest disorder were everywhere oa
enacted, and the fires mounted high- n
er and higher until toward ten a
o'clock Wilson avenue, the entire si
length of the village was in flames.r
N~o attempt was being made to ex
tinguish the flames or save the thou- w
sands of dollars in property being -r
carried, away or destroyed. e
* Early in the evening the mob had tl
attacked the post office. It was a a
small building and the dozen or more tl
men who entered it made short work t<
of it. The strong' box was' robbed p
and the torch put to the building. 0
One of the handsomest buildings ?
In the village was the banking house
of G. V. Hamory. The mob paid no
attention to it until after ten o clock.
Then it was recalled that a saloon t
had stood in that section and there
was a rush to the place. The saloon
was looted and fired and the flames 0
soon spread to the bank, destroying
it. d
A dry goods store near Seventha
street and Wilson avenue shared a
building with a saloon.. The party
which selected it for their prey made
the mistake of attacking the dry b
goods store first. As they approach- t

OPPOSED CONSCRIPTION :

ed Order.%
England right now is experiencing c
qualms about conscription. "Civil
war" and "social revolt" are terms
that are linked with any discussion
of the subject, says the Kansas City n
Star.
The vast majority of men do not
volunteer for war. The United Stgtes
found that out in the rebellion id
had to use the draft. And the draft
was, in a way, the last resort. It e
produced results.
It is said that England dares not
try conscription in the face of the b
present opposition, but conscription
in the United States, too, was bitterly .
opposed. It was charged that the
administration was reckless and irre- 0
sponsible and was promulgating the
doctrine of compulsory military ser
vice to further political ends. Lin- s
coln was slandered and abused.
New York was the centre of op
position, and when the enrolling of
ficers opened their booths the city
was thrown Into a state of bloody
riot that lasted nearly a week, in
which many were killed and wounded ]
and property damaged to the extent
of $2.000,000.
In January, 1863, the Quarterly
Review published an article urging
conscription. It said: "The couritry
calls for sacrifices at the commands
of duty, and a people that refuses to
make them has ceased to be worthy
of liberty or nationality."
The South was forcing its men into
service, and the North was trying to
fight the war with volunteers-and
not succeeding to any great extent.
Some one pointed out that the Con- b
federate.s had come nearer taking b.
Washington than the federals had
taking Richmond. w
Many newspapers opposed the
draft in fiery editorials. The New a
York Daily News said: "The mis
creants at the head of the govern- t
ment are bending all their power to
securing a perpetuation of their h(
ascendency for another four years,
and their triple method of accom
plishing this purpose is to kill off al
Democrats, stuff the ballot box with
bogus soldier votes and deluge the b(
recusant district with negro suffrage. b
The people are notified that one out
of about two and a half of our citi
zens are to be brought off into
Messrs. Lincoln & Co.'s charnel in
house. God forbid!"
The World said: "Weak and reck- m
less men at the head of the govern
ment are forcing conscription as an z
unnecessary stretch of governmental th
control over .individual liberty.'? th
But the government had to take dn
the risk. The Confederacy, on April Su
16, 1862, had adopted a measure
placing all white mcn between the
ages of 18 and 25 at the disposal of
their executive, and those already en
listed for one or two years were noti- th
fled that they would be held for the
uration of the war.
Nearly a year later the Union was th
struggling along with the volunteer v
system and meeting reverses. Like e
England of to-day, the. pleas to e
atriotism were -about exhausted and br
housands of able bodied men were do
shirking from battle. Human life r
hen, as now, was not the cheapest Ti
hing, despite such fatuous state- sti
ents. Men lost in battle could not bo
e replaced in munitions factories.
Lincoln summed the situation up. to
"We are contending with an enemy h
who, as I understand," he saidh
drives every able bodied man he
an reach into his ranks very much t
s a butcher drives bullocks into a
slaughter pen. No time is wasted, no tu
argument used. This produces an s
rmy with a rapidity not to be match-A
d on our side if we first waste time
o experiment with the volunteer sys- ta:
em." se
Conscription was decided upon and m
dopted Miarch 3, 1863, by a vote of e
15 to 49 in the House. A motion y
o delay the measure was overwhelm
d in the Senate, and it was adopted th
without a roll call of the yeas and pr
ays. .t o:
The act provided that all men, in
luding negroes and aliens who hadse
eclared for citizenship, between the o
ges of 18 and 45, were to be draft- to
d by the president, at his decretion, er
for not more than three years. Those
between the ages of 20 and 35 n .re
to be in the first class and the others
in the second. Federal provost mar
shals were to enroll the men within
the scope of the act and those not Es
reporting were to be considered as
deserters.
A commutation of service could be
bought for $300. Federal judges and ac
governors of states were exempt, as L
were only sons of widowed and de
pendent mothers or of aged and in
irm fathers. Fathers of motherless a
children less than 12 years old were S
excluded, and there were several
other classes set aside. i
The first draft for conscript in i
New York was advertised for July 13. st
1863. In the days immediately pre
eding incendiary handbills had ap 1
eared mysteriously and had incited hi
revolt. Several newspapers denounc
ed the draft-or any form of con- s
scription-as needless, unconstitu- i
tional and outrageous. It was as- in
serted that the enrolment from New b
York was too high already and thatH
there would be fraud in drawing m
names from the wheel.
The morning the enrolling officers
took their stations crowds began to
gather especially in the uptown dis
trict, where there was a compact,
foreign-born laboring population.
The drawing commenced at a house B
at Forty-ninth street artd Third ave
nue, and nearly a hundred names had
been drawn out peacably, when a
pistol shot was fired in the street in
the midst of a large crowd. 0
It must have been a signal. The f
house was showered instantly with
bricks and stones, and a wild mob '
rushed in, driving out the officersE
and clerks with bricks and clubs. CC
The paners were tort. up and the "
books destroyed.
Some one produced a can of tur
pentine and poured it over the furni-$
ture and struck a match. Policemen
and draft officers made a feeble at-$
tempt to disperse the rioters and I
check the flames. but they were
driven off by a bombardment of
stones.
John A. -Kennedy, superintendent
of police, appeared in response to a
rush call. He was not In uniform. C
but he was recognized and was set v

Lan an hour the session was enliv
led by debate over the government's
%utrality policy, -exports of war
unitions and travel by American
tizens on belligerent-owned ships.
There was no division of the de
tters along party lines. Senator
nes of Washington, Republican,
mnounced as "unpatriotic" American
tizens who Imperilled the nation by
king passage on belligerent vessels.
mnator Works, of California, Repub

Senator Lodge, ranking Republican
ember of the foreign relations com
ittee, declared that to place an em
trgo on arms now would be worth
ore to Germany, than a million
en, "it would be grossly unneutral"
td would, in fact, make the United
ates the ally of Germany.
Senators O'Gormai of New York
id Hitchcock of Nebraska, both
mocrats, urged the advisability of

Gorman also informed the Senate
at American Consul R. N. McNeely,

.rsia, had disregarded the advice of
nerican Consul General Skinner, at
ndon, that he make the journey to
len on a Dutch vessel.
The discussion was precipitated
ien Senator Jones read a news
per editorial urging American citi
ns to keep off belligerent ships and
vising the president to proceed
>wly in the present crisis, heeding
e interest of ninety-nine millions
Americans rather than that of a'
housand reckless, inconsiderate
.d -unpatriotic citizens who insist on
iveling on belligerent ships."
Senator Nelson of. Minnesota, Re
blican, aroused Senator O'Gorman
asking whether Senator Jones re
rded Consul McNeely unpatriotic
cause he sailed for his post on -the
rsia. After the New York senator
d explained that McNeely- had de
ned to heed Consul General Skin
r's advice to sail on a Dutch ship.
nator Works blazed the way to
eral debate on the position of the
ited States in the war by declaring
a American government was not

) California senator said:
"The government knew that the

igers were permitted in spite of

vernment itself, in full knowledge

ris morally responsible for the
aths of our citizens."
When Senator Works declared the
itod States actually was partici
ting in'the war by the sale of
mnitions Senator Reed, Democrat,
errupted to ask:
'Does the senator know that the
it loan placed in this country after
Swar began was a loan of $25,
0,000 to Germany, and that the

n or any other citizen? Does the I
ator not know that Germany pro

it was possible for her to get
"That may all be true," Senator
yrks replied, "but it does not alterC
Ssituation."
"If it be true," continued Senator
ed, "that the markets of this
intry are free and open to Ger

es, and that this government does

"It is impossible to get arms to
rmany, and I say it is morally
ong for this government to permit
.pments of arms to any of the bel
erents," Senator Works insisted.
added that his principal objection
s based on a conviction that the
ited States was aiding in prolong
the war and the killing of men,
c that he would not only put an
bargo on munitions, but also on
pument of food and clothing to the
nies of Europe.
Senator Lodge, in upholding the

Advices Received at Washington Fri

Consul Garrels at Alexandia,
Egypt, Friday -advised the state de

davits from twenty-one survivors of
the Persia, including Charles H.

that "no warning was given and no

The Austr -Hungarian government

to a dispatch received Friday by the

Penfield at Vienna.
Officers and crew of the- Persia,
the consul advised, have left Alex

arrival. Consul Garrels has been in

affidavits he'has obtained.
Ambassador Penfield's dispatch

Senators.,Fall and Lodge insisted
that the president should inform con

Senator' Williams diverted atten

upon questions arising from the
European war. He said an embargo

"I am not anticipating an attack.

that Germany virtually agreed with

that no Americans could possibly be

It has been known for some time
that Count von Bernstorff had de
vised a plan which he believed would.
satisfactorily .end the Lusitania con

submitted the proposition to the Ber

There was some delay because of the
adverse sentiment created by -the re

As for the disavowal asked" by gh

that the most effective form of dis
avowal was assurances that such acts
should not be commtted in the
