AH INTERVENTION IS
ARGUED IN U. S. SENATE
Senator Sherman Introduces
the United States Establish a Representative Govern
ment in Mexico, Action Being Called Up by Massacre
ol Americans on Monday by the Villista Bandits
Washington Jan. 12. Armed In
tervention In Mexico, establishment
of a representative government there,
and Immediate American evacuation
after th ha been accomplished, was
demanded today In a senate resolu
tion Introduced by Senator Sherman
or Illinois.
This resolution, actuated toy the
Mexican massacre of Americans Mon
day, bad more or less of a counter
part In the house when Representa
tive Dyer of Missouri Introduced a
resolution asking the president to ad
vise congress If "watchful waiting"
ought not to be ended.
Both Sherman and Dyer are re
publicans. While these attacks were on In
congress, Secretary Lansing wired
Carransa about the affair, hut the
state department said this message
waa not a demand on him.
The department expects him to do
all he can, and there will he no ne
cessity for a demand for action until
the first chief baa shown he is un
willing to seek redress for the mas
sacres.
In fact, Lansing Issued a state
ment indicating that he does not bold
Carransa greatly to blame In the eltu
atlon, but Instead blames Americans
for remaining in Mexico In the face
of warnings to leave. This state
ment said:
"The department feels that It took
every precaution to prevent Ameri
cans from exposing their lives in the
region where guerilla warfare is In
progress."
He called attention to the fact that
passports to Mexico have hecn con
sistently refused.
Meanwhile the state department Is
energetically Investigating the mas
sacre.
In congress the assaults upon the
administration's Mexican policy were
not confined solely to introduction of
the resolutions. Senator Galllnger
declared that It was time to substi
tute action in Mexico for "watchful
waiting."
"The administration," he dclared,
ONLY SURVIVOR OF
El Paso, Jan. 12. Shot down as
they attempted to escape, 16 Ameri
cans, massacred by Villista bandits
In Chihuahua Monday, were given
no chance for their lives, according
to the statement of T. H. Holmes,
solo survivor, who arrived here to
day. Holmes escaped a similar fate
through the "ruse of stumbling and
falling over a railroad tie, worn out
and apparently dead from the effects
of the experience. The tragedy has
shaken his nerves, and he told a
broken story. '
'lAt 2 p. m. Monday," he said,
"our special was stopped near La
vista. I wsb sitting with Tom Evans,
and he said, 'Let's get out and see
what's the mntter.'
"He and I started out of the car,
and Watson and another man Joined
us. We were not expecting anything,
and we merely went out to get the
air.
"As I Jumped to the ground a
group of Mexicans opened ftro on us.
Evans was hit by the first volloy and
foil. Watson started up the em
bankment, while the Mexicans kept
shooting nt him. Then the Moxloans
began shooting nt me and I ran
alongside the car with the bullets!
striking nil around me. I stumbled

Resolution Seeking to Have
"should take steps to stop such out
rages."
Senator Borah called President
Wilson's Mexican policy "a com
promising, ilde-stepplng, procrastin
ating and un-American policy, whkh
has failed to protect American lives
and honor."
He demanded American interven
tion unlet Carransa gives assurances
of his power to protect American In
terests In (Mexico.
' The message Lansing sent to Car
ransa, through Consul Sllllman at
Queretaro ,sald:
"C. E. Watson, an official of a
mine smelter, the operation com
mittee at Chihuahua, with 15 com
panions, were taken off a train 40
miles west of " Chihuahua, stripped
and shot because they were Ameri
cans, apparently in pursuit of the re
cently reported policy of Villa. The
shootings occurred in the sone said
to he dominated (by the de facto gov
ernment. The forces of the central
government at Chihuahua are said to
be inert and Incapable of taking care
of the situation. Urge upon Car
ransa the necessity of Immediate is
suing instructions to provide ade
quate forces for pursuit, capture and
punishment of the bandits respon
sible for. thl dastardly outrage.
"After Obregon took possession of
Chihuahua, many Americans return
ed to that district to resume opera
tlons and were furnished safe con
ducts by the de facto government's
military forces. It is believed that
the murdered men held such safe
conducts. Request also that adequate
forces be sent to the different mining
districts to protect life and property.
El Paso, Jan. 12. In a helpless
rage this city this afternoon awaited
arrival of a special train hearing the
bodies of 16 Americans and two
Britishers, bullet-riddled by Mexicans
In Chihuahua Monday.
Apparently nothing has been done

over a tie. They evidently thought
I was killed, so I did not rise. .
"I lay there a few minutes until
the shooting at my three companions
ended, but the Mexicans began shoot
ing through the windows at the oth
ers Inside. Some of the boys rushed
to the doors, and I supposed they
were slaughtered. Then I began to
crawl along the ground, as the Mexi
cans were not paying any attention
to me. When I got out of their view,
I crept on my hands and knees to
an open place and ran as fast as I
could.
"Near Santa Ysaibel I hid in a
Mexican ranch house. I gave a man
there some money to take care of me,
and he fixed the cuts and bruises
that I received in escaping. At night
the ranchman drove me toward Chi
huahuaf and I reached there nt 7
o'clock Tuesday morning.
"I learned later that Watson and
Anderson wore only mounded in the
first shooting and were later given
(the 'tiro de gracla1 or 'mercy shot.'
The Mexicans shot them through the
head, practically blowing off their
Heads."
Holmes, who was accompanied
hers, by ..his wife, has no Idea who
commanded the bandits.

VILLISTA
E
BEMT SAYS
II
Chicago, Jan. 12. Peace between
the republicans and bull moosers
rests upon the G. O. P., George W.
Perkins frankly stated today follow
ing yesterday's bull moose vote to
hold a convention June 7 at the same
time that the republicans do, and, If
possible, to unite "on the same
standard bearer and the same prin
ciples." Only a little coaxing, leaders de
clared, la necessary to bring the bull
moose Into the fold for a double
harness race with the G. O. P.' ele
phant against the democratic donkey.
Perkins and others are hopeful
that Colonel Roosevelt will be the
chosen standard bearer of the two
parties, but they are not certain of
this result. Who is desired for sec
ond choice has not been Indicated.
Justice Hughes of the federal su
preme court is strong with pro
gressives In the east and west, but
nine out of ten of the progressive
committeemen, whose session ad
Journed last night, believed Roose
velt will be the republican and hence
the progressive nominee.
Medill McCormlck, who recently
announced bis transfer, of allegiance
from the buU moose to the republi
can party, will be one of the prlncl
pal Intermediaries in the proposed
compromise between the two parties.
But, despite the virtual agreement
of the committeemen to combine on
national issues, there will be several
hot state fights before local amalga
tlons occur.
Missouri already has .announced
that she will have progressive state
ticket, while Pacific coast represen
tatives are hopeful of continuing the
progressive party regardless of na
tlonal events. Further evidence of
the line-up In next summer's cam
paign came last night with announce
ment of the progressive's declara
tlon of principles. In this they took
a sharp whack at President Wilson's
foreign policy and declared for i
national preparedness in both a mill
tary and industrial sense. .
"Because of the failure of the Wil
son administration to deal adequate
ly with national honor and industrial
welfare," said the declaration," this
country faces problems of a graver
and more far-reaching consequence
than any since the civil war."
Then again, the statement de
clared: -
"The Wilson administration has
repudiated the faith of our fore
fathers, which made the American
flag the sufficient protection of an
American citizen around the world.
It has suffered American men, wo
men and children to be slaughtered
and American liberty to travel and
trade to be subject to the arbitrary
and lawless coercion of foreign belli
gerents. It first among
American administrations has shown
the supine spirit, whose sure conse
quence is the contempt of the world."

Swiss reports today declared the Ger -

father, Kaiser Wllhelm.

CETTIWJE IS
FALLING 10
Montenegrin Capital Hard
Pressed by the Enemy, Is
Being Evacuated, and Will
Soon Be in Teutons' Hards
Rome, Jan. 12. The early faU of
Cettlnje, Montenegrin capital, waa
forecasted today by dispatches con
firming reports that the Austrian
forces had occupied Mount Lowcen,
dominating Cettinje and only seven
miles distant. .-
The military evacuation- of Cettlnje
began Sunday, when the arsenal was
dismantled and everything of military
value was removed. The new capital,
however, has not yet been selected.
The Austrian! are striking forcibly
at the Montenegrin defenders, handi
capped by . lack of equipment and
foodstuffs.
Mount Lowcen fell after five days
of terrific and uninterrupted bom
bardment from a squadron in the
Oattaro gulf and from the forts and
lighter artillery brought up to close
range.
The Austrian guns blew to pieces
the first line of Montenegrin trenches
on the lower slopes of the mountain,
slaughtering hundreds of the defend
ers. Then a combined Austrian as
sault carried the second line. Har
assed by artillery and machine guns,
the Monteneglrinswere pushed over'
the Btrmmlt, still fighting bravely de
spite enormous losses.
"The Austrians are advancing to
ward Cettinje and the fighting con
tinues." said the Montenegrin con
sulate officially today. "The govern
ment archives hare been removed."
Vienna, Jan. 12. Capture of
Mount Lowcen, Montenegro,, was de
tailed by the war office today.
"In three days of fierce fighting,"
said the official statement, "our in
fantry, co-operating with the heavy
artillery and our navy, overpowered
the bitter enemy resistance and the
difficulties of the wintry Carst moun
tains, which arise from the sea as a
wall and have been organized as a
defense for years."
The statement claimed capture of
many guns and supplies.
Defeat of the Montenegrins near
Berane, In northeast Montenegro, was
also claimed.
London, Jan. 12. The govern
ment's bill compelling "slackers" to
respond to the call of "Your King
and Your Country Need You," wheth
er they wish to or not, seemed likely
to pass to second reading today with
flying colors.
i A conference with labor leaders
was planned. In this government
leaders hoped to get labor support
tft. the measure, so that England
!woui,i at least appear to the outside
(world to ,be a unlted factor In press
lng the war to a successful conclu
sion. The task appeared the easier
in view of the growing support tor
the bill.
I Sir Edward Carson, who recently
quit the cabinet, was on record today
as declaring the bill la essential to
success. In support of this state-
nient he pointed out that lack of
men had been a prime factor In de
termining the failure of the Dardan
elles expedition. . At the same time,
