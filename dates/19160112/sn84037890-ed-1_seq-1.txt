The Cincinnati Times-Star, owrtJd
by C. P. Taft, brother of the former
President, publishes n letter from
its Washington correspondent, Gus
J. Knrger, giving an outline of the
former President's views with rc
Fnrd to the suggestion that Col.
rheodoro Roosevelt may be the Re
publican Presidential nominee in
191G or dictate the choice of the Re-
publican National Convention, If Col.
Roosevelt's personal ambitlou shall
not ho realized.
AC K&rtitt.ivaB closely identified I
with the cause of Mr. Taft in iuua
nrd 1012, acting as his press repre
tcnfitlvo, a position In which he
continued during Mr. Taffs Whlto
Home Incumbency. What ho says
with itferonce to Prof. Taffs opli.
icr.3 is accepted as authoritative by
his Washington colleagues. His let
ter t'o the Times-Star rollows:
"That any other than a 'real' Re
publican shall bo the Republican
nominee or have a part in deter
mining the choice o fthe Republican
National Convention Is regarded as
an 'absurd suggestion,' a 'ridiculous
proposal,' by Prof. William Howard
Taft, former President of the United
States. And he is far from sympa
thetic with the attitude of certain
leading Republicans in tho United
States Senate Republicans who, al
though not identified with tho Pro
gressive defection, have been play
ing the game of 'good Lord and good
devil for the sake of remaining in
the good graces of both of the fac
tional elements.
"I saw former President Taft in
.Washington on tho occasion of his
wVcent visit to Washington in con-
M Uion with Red Cross affairs. Mr.
J
ft has thrown himself vigorously
II enthusiastically Into the worK
It has been immensely Interested
(lu tho diversity of Red Cross activi
ties. Ho had but little time while
here to discuss politics, and what ho
said was direct, emphatic, aggresslvo
and to tho point. His animadver
sions were directed, not to tho spirit
of compromise designed to bring
back tho erring brethren, but to tho
mere suggestion of any plan to con
ciliate tho so-called Progressive
loaders at tho- cost and surrender of
Republican principle.
"Mr. Taft was not discussing tho
situation with a view, to publicity.
But he has no objection, I am sure,
to having it understood that ho
takes It as a matter of course that
Col. Roosevelt and Mr. Taft, having
been the opposing leaders Jn tho
euarrols of 1912, tho Republican
party will not court nnother defeat
by tho nomination of either.
"I take tho liberty of putting
what follows In quotation marks, for
the sake of simplicity. It may bo
accepted as presenting Mr. Taft's
opinions, without committing lr.m to
the languaso.
"Regular Republicans havo shown
noJsposItlon to ruako themselves

survival of their party, of It3 rehabll-
Ration, and restoration to a position
of aggressiveness anu mmtance, they i
have boen careful to throw no dim-

have been misinterpreted. Leaders

a true note struck as to business
conservation and a medium course
prescribed In the matter of peace
and war preparedness. If the plan
should be to conciliate the Progres

will be at a cost merited by such a
course. Even though ictory could

would avail nothing, for the party
would divide again as it did before."

FIRST INVENTED
THE STREET CAR
And Ran It In the City Of
New York.
JOHN STEPHENSON HIS 11
Beginning Of Industry Which
Has Undergone Wonder
ful Development.
IT WAS A FAILURE AT FIRST
To John Stephenson Is due much
credit for his untiring energy in the
Initiation of street transportation
facilities. He not only constructed
the first omnibus ever mado in thl
C'ltntry, but hi' designed and con
structed the first street railway car
In the world. He was an Irishman
by birth, but was brought to this
country by his parents when he was
2 years old. His father desired that
ho should become a 'merchant, but
in nrnfnrrntl lnncliniilrs.
Stephenson's first street railway
car was exhibited at the opening of
the New York and Harlem road, oh
November 20, 1S32, on which occa
sion it was used by the Mayor and
City Council. As a consequence of
adding railway cars to his business
he was obliged to suspend payments
during tho linnncial crisis of 183",
and was forced to settle with tils
creditors for 50 cents on the dollar.
This caused him to drop railway
cars when ho started business again
in 1S43, for street cars were not In
great demand. Coacnes and omni
buses were his staple product.
In seven years he had paid every
cent of his indebtedness n feat
which won for him the name of
"Honest John Stephenson," first
among business men and afterward
with the public, owing partly to the
parading up and down llroadway of
a four-horse truck placarded as fol
lows: "This is the way one bankrupt
pays his debts ills name Is Honest
John Stephenson." Tho truck had
been delivered by Mr. Stephenson to
Jordan L. Mott, a creditor, who had
persistently refused to accept cash
payment. Mr. Stephenson presented
him with this truck, which Mott ac
cepted and paraded through the
streets to signify his opinion of
Stephenson.
By 1853 slrcot cars camo into
general favor, and Stephenson so
quickly adjusted his business to tho
changed conditions that he became
for a time street car builder for the
world. Stephenson died at New
Rochellc. N. Y on July 31, 1S93.
Tho rails of Stephenson's first
street road consisted of Hat Iron bars
spiked to timbers resting on stone
blocks. The car was of nn omnibus
pattern, built In three compart
ments, entered from tho side and
each holding 10 persons, and with
three seats on tho roof for 30 moro
passengers. It was drnwu by horses.
Boston was the second city to be
gin the construction of horse-car
lines In 185C, In Philadelphia In
1S57 and Now Orleans In 1SG1, us
ing for tho first time tho onc-horso
small car usually known ns tho
"bobtail."
In Franco a lino was constructed
In Paris In 1853. In Great Britain,
George Francis Train, after three
years of earnost endeavor, succeeded
in 1SG0 in building a road at Birk
enhead and one in London, which
was removed In n fow months, and
not until 1870 were horso cars per
mitted in that city. In 18GG a num
ber of horse-car lines wore built In
South Amerlcn, Tho first street rail
way in Paris "was called the "Amer
ican Railway." Washington Post

HISTORY OF THE JEWISH

Tho history of tho Jewish raco is
as old as the history of tho world
ltsolf. Through all tho changes
wrought by tlmo tho Jewish people
havo maintained their national char
acteristics with such wonderful fi
delity that oiio of the raco may be
singled out in any assemblage. Tho
request of Dr. Abram Simon, of
"Washington, D. C, that the study ot
Jewish history and Jewish llternturo
be introduced into American univer
sities Is one that should bo mot with
hearty assent. Tho Jewish National
Chautauqua Association recently
convened in St. Louis. Attention
wag called to the fact that Jewish
history was not included In Araerl-
can university courses. It is to be
hoped that it may be added to unl-
ivoralty studies at no distant day.

Tho Jewish people nrc n picturesque

some splendid examples of patriotic
Jewish citizens. The Jews have on
numerous occasions boen n persecut

nnd will yet outlive all foolish and

from which the mother of tho Incar

EASY FOR JAPS
TO ENTER U. S.
In Order To Earn a Livelihood.
VIOLATE COMOU AGREEMEWT
Between Nations By Many
Devices, Says Head Of Im
migration Bureau.
PLAXXIXG TO BAH THEM OUT
Washington, Jan. 7. Tho "gentle
men's ngreement" between the Unit
ed States and Japan lu regard to Im
migration has some loopholes which
permit too many Japanese to enter
tills country, it Is asserted by Com
missioner General of Immigration
Caminetti In his annual report to
Secretary of Labor W. B. Wilson.
Ho complains particularly of the ex
ception In favor of members of fam
ilies, and says:
"Of tho 9,029 Japanese admitted
during the year, 5,542 were males
and 3,4 S7 females. The latter con
sisted largely of photograph brides,
or proxy brides, so called youw?
women coming to this country to
join husbands with whom a so-called
marriage had been contracted In
Japan by arrangemeut between their
respective families, often without
the parties ever having seen eacii
other and In a largo majority of
cases these women themselves are
laborers who enter the fields and
factories and work alongside their
husbands. They aro laborers in ex
actly the same sense and to practi
cally ho same extent as the males
With whom they work." J
Tho Orientals aro using the Amer
can colonies too, Mr. Caminetti' says,
as stepping stones for their entrauce
to the continental United States.
They gain free entrance as laborers
to Hawaii, Porto Rico and the Phil
ippines, and then, by one excuse or
another, finally get to the United
States and settle hero. In the last
year 2,437 thus gained entry in San
Francisco, New York and Seattle.
The plan to Americanize Hawaii,'
the Commissioner says, is not mak
ing substantial progress, although
"In perhaps none of the Insular pos
sessions is it so Important that tho
population shall bo overwhelmingly
American as in this particular group
of islands."
"In tho Philippines," ho adds.'
"thero is practically no hope or ex
pectation that within any reasonable
period tho population of these Is
lands will becomo Americanized In
nnv ro.il senso imp la tim i,.ii
will In passing upon tho cases of ap
plicants look to tho (to them) re
mote possibility that such appli
cants really intend to como to tho
mainland."
He suggests thnt Hawaii bo put
on tho saino basis as tho United
States mainland with respect to im
migration. It Is doubtful, ho says.
If It Is ndvlsnblo to permit any largo
number ot Filipinos to enter Hawaii.
Ho urges that this Government use
every effort to stimulate Americans
to colonizo in Hawaii by giving pub
lic lauds there to them.
Ho urges, also, that all but tho
iargcst
post-offlces In the United
States bo utilized as employment
agencies, where tho Postmaster can
give an hour each day to bring to
gether wage earners and employers.
An automobile patrol service is
rnrnllimnilflnil nil Mm Pnnmllnii n.wl
Mexlcan borders, to keep out tho
Chinese and other aliens. Tho smug
glers now uso autos in bringing in
tho Orientals, ho declares.
In mentioning tho fact, already
published, that the not gain in im
migration in tho last fiscal year,
owing to the war, was only 50,070,
