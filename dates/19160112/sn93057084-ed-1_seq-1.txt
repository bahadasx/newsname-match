Old Time Tempsrance Revival at
Mitctisli Arousos Grsatest
Enthusiasm.
Francis Murphy or John B. Gough had
returned and were making their pow
erful appeals to men to stop drinking.
The meetings began with a men's
meeting on Sunday afternoon, Jan. 2,
at the Baptist church, and a great
popular meeting at the Methodist
Episcopal church in the evening.
Since that time large crowds have
gathered nightly in the city hall,
where Mr. Rankin has poured forth
his powerful oratory until the harm
and evils of drink have become real
in the minds of the hearers. It. is the
presentation of a phase of the tem
perance question that has been great
ly neglected of late years in the dis
cussion of the business aspect of the
question, and that people are still at
tracted by the total abstinence appeal
is shown by the fact that every night
large numbers march up and sign the
pledge and put on the total abstinence
button.
THE "POOR MAN'S CLUB."
Saloon Kicks You Out Just When You
Pay Your Dues.
The saloon frequently is called the
"poor man's club." True it is a club,
and when it cracks him over the head
he is down for the count. It beats
him into moral indifference, intellec
tual mediocrity and physical ineffi
ciescy.

Thus the saloon or so called "poor
man's club" is the greatest menace
to modern life. It is the enemy of
marriage. It destroys all chance for
enjoyment of home life on the part of
its victims, and is gradually increas-
ins the vast army of derelicts, the
great, and growing army of the down
tnd-outa, whose chief comp'.nint. is the
wtrre competition of the equally large
army of girls which they have forced
into the op?n field of competition.
