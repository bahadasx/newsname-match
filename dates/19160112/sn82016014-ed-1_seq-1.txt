after the latter haa been somewhat
illuminated from a darky's intoxicat

happy one to leave for parts unknown
and in return the inebriated man
called the officer some unkind names
and refused to leave.
Cook promptly seized the young fel
low, turned him over across his knees
and gave him a sound whipping with
his mighty paw. The offender, as he
beat a hasty retreat, made all sorts
of dire threats and declared his inten

Chief Parsons and get Cook fired.

aeroplanes and three of the German
aircraft were destroyed or captured,
according to Dr. W. H. Vincent, of the

lins have not been able to bombard
London or its suburbs since October 14
last." said Dr. Vincent, "is because the
British have established efficient de

During December there were 12 sep

England Suggests Eliminating
AH German Efforts.
BY WILBlIi S. FORKKST.
London, Jan. 12. Insertion of
clause in the peace agreement binding
Ciermany to refrain rrom ail export
business for a period of years is one
of the provisions suggested by trade
experts to curtail Germany's trade
after the war. it was learned today.
Leading London business men to
day generally approved the statement
made by President Runciman of the
board of trade in commons last night
that Great Britain must so curtail Ger
many's commerce that the Germans
cannot dispute world supremacy with
the British nation.
The proposal to cut off Germany's
export business was the most drastic
made to date.
A suggestion was also made of a
German boycott agreement by the al
lied powers, which would refuse to buy
German made goods for a certain
number of years after the war. At
; the same time, England is preparing
! to bid on an enormous scale for the
commerce of neutrals.
