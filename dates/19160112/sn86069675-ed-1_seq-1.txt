RILLS MINER
, TO SAVE FRIEND
Dees Major Helburn of Middles
boro, Husband of Former Mt.
Sterling Girl.
' The many friends here of Major
E. S. Helburn, former Mayor of
Middlesboro, and candidate in 1911
for the Republican nomination for
Lieutenant Governor, whoso wifo
was Miss Stella Thompson, former
ly an atlractivo girl of Mt. Sterling,
will regret to learn that late Sat
urday, .at Bgsworth, a mining town
in Bell county, in defenso of a
friend and' business associate, he
was called upon to shoot and kill
Alt Farmer, an intoxicated miner,
whiloiPanrier and P. L. Renebaum,
superintendent of the Winona Coal
&- Coke Company, wero struggling
on tho ground in front of the campy
store.
The muzzle of Farmers weapon
was pressing against Renebnum's
side after two shots had been fired
at tho superintendent, one grazing
his abdomen, according to Helburn,
and another shot would have been
fatal to Renebaum.
Helburn Gives Story
"A revolver was lying by a win
dow in the ofllee of tho camp com-
raissa'ry, and I seized this after
trying in vain to pull tho mea apart
and get possession- of Farjner's
weapon," said lelburn. "Tho trou-
j Hn-.started when the miner began
abusing' u womjg, Jane yvoou, as
she passed in front of tho store.
He had been drinking, and his loud
words and tho woman's protesta
tions -attracted Mr. Renebaum, who
ran out and told Farmer to let the
woman nlono. After a few words
a shot was fired at Renebaum, wUq
rushed upon tho miner and tried, to
disarm, him. In the struggle that
followed both fell to tho ground,
and another shot was fired.
"I had been in tho office with Mr.
Reacbamn, and seeing that his Life
was in peril. I ran to his aid. Tho

miner was fighting liko a demon,
i and both of us1 were no match for
I his strength. Mr. Renebaum is a
friend of mine, as well as k law
abiding citizen.
' bmce retiring n year ago as
Mayor of Middlesboro I became en
gaged in the oporation of coal
mines, and was at tho Bosworth
camp on .business. The woman I
had seen befpre. That'Supt. Rene-
bnum was justified in taking a hand
in her behalf, there could be no
doubt, and that I was justified in
taking n hand in behalf of Rene
baum there seemed no doubt to me.
When it beenmev apparent that
nothing could be done but to use
tho revolver .which I found in the
window, 'I' used it as effectually as
I know how.
Expresses Sorrow.
"I am sorry I killed the man. It
is tho ilrst thing of tho kind that-1
have been mixed upxwith. I prompt
ly 'surrendered to tho police. My
bail Was fixed at $3,000, and I was
released upon providing tho proper
security. Farmer has been living in
the community a good while, and
bore a fair reputation, when sober,
so far as I have been able to learn.
I will try to find out something of
his family connections arid do1 what
I van to reliove their bereavement.''

know tho end was not far off.
In temperament ho was mild and
candid; and yet remarkable for nn
uncompromising firmness. Ho was
generous and manly and in his deal
ings with his fcllowmnn by his lion
esty and fairness he won their
respect and friendship. , '
He believed in tho fatherhood of
God and tho brotherhood of man.

SUNDAY CLOSING LAW
Practically every business house
in tho city closes on Sunday and
we understand there is n movement
on foot to requ'ro nil business
houses except drug stores and res
taurants to close nt twelye o'clock
on- Saturday night and remain clos
ed until Monday morning. Thoy
contend it is not fair to those 'who
closo for tho Sabbath to have mer
chants in competing lines to remain
open. Wo understand there is an
ordinance requiring Business houses
to remain closed as stated above but
that same has not been enforced
strictly. The barber shops have
agreed among themselves and do
not open on Sunday.

Customers Should Make Special
Efforts to Settle Their
January Accounts.
The credit system is one of the
greatest evils that beset the aver
age country merchant. Practically
nil of the stores in the cities'" ex
cept those who charge interest on
accounts and take mortgages on
the goods sold, require tho purchas
er to pay cash when buying. In the .
smaller communities where the mer
chants know personally their ciis
toiriers, "more "than CO per cent, of
their business is credit business.
Many merchants are forced to bor
row money to carry their custom
ers nnd it is but right when they
send out their January statements
that those who owo them should
respond promptly. Remember the
merchant has conferred a favor up
on you by giving you credit and yon
should show your appreciation by
pnying him when he asks for what
's duo him.
A prominent merchant told the
writer that ho hod several custom
ers on his books that had owed large
accounts for more than a year and
paid absolutely no attention to
statements, although some of therm
wore worth thousands of dollars.
The credit system is being so badly
abuse'd we believe the day it not far
distant when practically every bus
iness will be placed on a cash
basis.
