TO DENY U. S. CLAIMS.
Great Britain and France Not to Yield
Sea Dispute.
Washington, Jan. 12.—Great Britain
and France are about to send an identi
cal note to the tlnitedi states in reply
to tho voluminous protest presented by
direotion of President Wilson against
allied restrictions upon American trade.
Authoritative Information which has
reached here is to the effect that the
note was drafted in London by the for
eign office in consultation with the
French ambassador. It is now In Paris
being examined by the French officials.
When the revision Is complete it will
be handed to the United States, prob
ably In the course of the next few days.
The note will be quite as vigorous In
character, from all accounts, as that
sent by the state department It will
point out that if the attitude adopted by
thet-United Stages against the form of
blockade established by the allies
should be concurred In by the latter it
will be possible to send thru neutral
ports anything of which Germany may
be in need, and that therefore the
measures In restriction of enemy trade
sould he absolutely nullified.
Should Great Britain and France
proclaim a formal blockade, which the
United States considers the legal way
to proceed, It is pointed out that ships
violating the blockade would be
condemned, whereas under the orders
in council this action Is not taken, and
as to the goods ireized Instead of being
returned or the owners being compen
sated, the owners would receive noth
ing.
Moreover, lt will be pointed out that
there is no guarantee that a shipment
say of lard consigned to a Danish
agent,
.will .remain In Denmark, espe
cially when the shipment is beyond the
amount consumed tjy the Danish people
in normal jt^nes.
It may b» taken for granted, there
fore. that the allies will not chaage
their present method of
enemy trade.1

But Fails to Inflict Injury Mutiny T-n •»,
Caused by Order Depriving Convicts
of Candy and Other Luxuries Ob
jeotionablo Order Issued by
Cedar Rapids, Jan. 12.—Two guards
at Anamosa have gone insane as the
result of a mutiny among the prison
era that started Friday night and con
tlnued until Sunday, before the men
were brought under control. Seventy
prisoners have been kept on bread and
water and between thirty and forty
are in solitary confinement.
This morning, while Warden Mc
Claughrey was telephoning an account
of the disturbance, he was threatened 5
by one of the guards from behind hut
escaped Injury.
The mutiny was caused by the cut
ting off of supplies of candy and other
luxuries by the auditors on the qgon- c
slon of their late inspection. 4
Break Up Furniture. J*.
The convicts resented especially the
cutting off of their supply of tobacco,
They refused to work, kept up a con
tlnual din night and day, and broko
up prison furniture.
The luxuries accorded to the prison
ers by Warden McClaugbrey were tho
subject of consideration by the board
of control and were discussed with the
warden before his reappointment a
week ago. This question was settled
before McClaughrey was given a re
appointment.
Order Only Temporary.
From reports available today It wage
learned that the taking away from the!
prisoners of certain luxuries was but
a temporary measure, made impera
tlve by an inventory that is being con-5
ducted by state authorities.
However, the men failed to Interpret
the action property, and believed that
steps were under way to deprive them
permanently at their totaoco an other
sources of enjoyment.
With the *lrst outbreak, prison of
fldials trled-t0"qdtot- the men and pre
vent news of the mutiny spreading to
the outside world. The men'lT iwfates
tatlons, however, became So boisterous
that residents living within the .-vicin
ity of the institution became concerned
and as a result the condition of In
ternal affairs was made known.
In Solitary Confinement..
According to reports, the men be
oame so indignant that all appeal to
reason so Indignant that all appeal to
bclllon they broke windows and at
tempted other depredations at the re
formatory.
Two guards, whose names the war
den refused to divulge, are said to be
insane as a result of their efforts to
conquer the men.
It is the intention of the warden to
keep the men in solitary confinement
until their state of mind calms. It is
thought that no further trouble will be
experienced.
