CRUSHED TO DEATH
Wright A. Chesley Fatally Injured
In Elevator At New Post Office
Was Popular Carrier.
Shortly before eight o'clock Friday
morning, Wright A. Chesley was
caught in the elevator in the new Cal
derwood block and so badly crushed
that he died about 15 minutes after
reaching the home of his parents, Mr.
and Mrs. H. A. Chesley, on Lafayette
street. No one saw the accident and
the young man was unable to explain
how it happened before he died. He
was about to start out with the mail
of his route, R. F. D. No. 4," and it is
supposed stepped to the elevator to
go down to the basement and out of
the building. Evidently he did not
open the gate to the elevator but
reached inside and pulled the rope the
wrong way as the elevator shot up
wards instead of downwards and
caught him and pinioned him between
the floor of the elevator and the floor
and partition of the floor above.
Two or three men were in the post
office sorting the mail but did not see
or hear him. Assistant Postmaster
Walter Kellogg was at the delivery
window waiting on a patron and heard
an unusual noise. He turned but saw
nothing unusual, the door to the ele
vator hiding young Chesley. As soon
as he finished at the window Kellogg
stepped back and found Chesley pin
ned there with his legs hanging down
inside the postoffice. Kellogg started
the elevator downwards and released
the young man who had been caught
across the lower chest and abdomen
and terribly crushed.
Dr. W. J. Aldrich was called and
Mr. Calderwood took the young man
home in his ambulance. He was able
to greet his mother and recognized his
father after being taken into his home
but died in a few minutes.
Mr. Chesley was 21 years old and
had been a rural carrier for about a
year. He- was very popular on his
route and was well liked by a large
circle of acquaintances in the village.
He is survived by his father and
mother and one sister. Hazel Chesley.
H. A. Chesley, the father, was slightly
injured Saturday afternoon. He
started to drive down town to make
arrangements for the funeral and the
hold backs were not properly fasten
ed. "The sleighstruck the horse caus
ing it to run and it threw Mr. Chesley
from the sleigh at the foot of Cale
donia street. He had one hand and
one leg quite severely bruised and the
ligaments in his wrist badly strained.
The funeral was held from the
Chesley home Monday at two o'clock
and was very largely attended. The
bearers were Burleigh Carpenter,
Perley Amidon. William Hall, Everett
Montgomery, Wendell Drew, and Eu
gene Dennis. The interment w.as in
Mount Pleasant cemetery.
Those called here to attend the fu
neral were Mrs. Eva Ayer Cameron
and Mrs. Blanche Ayer D,avis of Wal
lingford, Amasa Simpson of Lyndon
ville, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Chesley,
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Barber, and L.
C. Chesley of Sheffield, A. A. Barber
and Mr. and Mrs. Harry Hovey and
son Ralph of Lyndonville.
CIVIL CASES NEARLY DONE
County Court May Reach Criminal
Docket This Week An Effort
To Continue Hatch Case.
Caledonia county court resumed its
sessions at nine o'clock Tuesday morn
ing after a recess from Saturday. The
case of Orrln W. Kittredge vs. W.
Owen Harvey was called but owing to
the alleged sickness of Mr. Harvey it
was passed and the case of Farmers
Company vs. Connecticut Valley Co.
was called. This suit is brought to
recover for a quantity of logs cut and
delivered. It is expected this case will
be followed by the case of Walter J.
Aldrich vs. Boston and Maine Rail
road and unless the Kittredge-Harvey
case is ready then it will finish the
civil docket.
The criminal docket will be taken
up then and.it is expected some of the
smaller cases will be heard first. An
attempt will be made to have the case
against Hatch for manslaughter tried
as soon as Attorney-General Barber
can come. The attorneys for Hatch
have asked the state officers to have
the case continued but the state does
not want the case neglected longer.
In the case of Martin D. Turner vs.
D. J. Howard the jury returned a ver
dict for the defendant.
The breach of promise case of Ag
nes McGovern vs. Edward Riley that
was expected to follow this case did
not materialize as a settlement was
announced. Miss McGovern was paid
$1,000 damages.
Edward McGowan was brought into
court and pleaded guilty to petit lar
ceny, for breaking into the store of
G. E. Wallace at East Ryegate some
time ago, and he was sentenced to
serve from three to four months in
the county Jail.
In the case of Nelson A. Park, Admr.
of Estate of Peach Thomas vs. Flora
A. Bowles and Trustees, a verdict was
given the defendant.
The last case for the week was that
of Theresa M. Dionne vs. American
Express Co. in which the plaintiff
sought to recover for goods left on the
platform of the depot at Sheldon
Junction and burned with the depot
during the night. The jury returned
a verdict for the plaintiff to recover
$284.75. The case will be appealed
to the supreme court.
The 25 . cent piece was made
famous by the American Liver
Tablets, the perfect laxative.
