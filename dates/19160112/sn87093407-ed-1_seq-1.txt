Pacific Coast Shipbuilding Plants Humming
With Business; Seattle Drydock & Con
struction Co. Officials Declare Unprec
edented Demand Should Last 5 Years
This ii the year of promise.
The Seattle Construction and Drydock company will, during 1916, put into
circulation here DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY it ha» heretofore annually
•pent.
The company's payroll, now about 1,800, will BE GREATLY INCREASED
during 1916.
The plant will be enlarged by the addition of at least two slips, possibly mora.
These are positive assurances made by officials of the concern today, and in
dicate the reflection of prosperity upon the shipbuilding industry of Puget Sound.
Construction activity has reached a mark away beyond former records, keeping
pace with other big shipbuilding yards of the East.
Work, it has been announced, will begin at once on the yards of the new
Skinner & Eddy corporation, a heavily capitalized concern, with two big freighters
aa their initial output.
In the other 23 shipbuilding concerns in and adjacent to Seattle, the fresh
impetus brought about by the universal cry for vessels is also being materially felt.
Craft which the bigger concerns are now too rushed to bid on, are being built
or contracted for by the lesser concerns. Business is more widely scattered, aridN
the prospect is that this will increase during the year.
"We have never before had such an amount of business,' said Assistant
General Manager H. W. Kent, of the Seattle Construction and Drydock Co., to a
Star man today. "We are running to full capacity, and are forced to turn away
tonnage for which there is a clamoring demand.
"We now have under construction two 5,000-ton (deadweight) steel freighters
for the Ward line in the East, three submarines and one torpedo boat destroyer
