Going to Assistance of

London. Jan. 11 The EriUsli force
in Mesopotamia under General Ayl
iner, proceeding uj the Tigris to the
relief of Kut-el-Ainara, is still hailed
ut Sheikh Saad, Home twenty miles
fiom Kutel-Ainaia, acconliiiK to the
latest advices received by. the Kovern

condilions and l!ie necessity ol reniov
lug the wounded by river.
This announcement was made in
the Utilise of ('ominous this afternoon
by J. Austin Chamberlain, Secretary
for India.
.Military observers here are of the
opinion that the position ol the re
lieving force is by no means satis
factory, for it finds in front of ii a
Turkish army superior in numbers.
Therefore, it is evident that a suc
cessful junction of the two liritish
forces, although they are only twenty
miles apart, may prove a cliMieuli mat
ter.

- That BefeJ Seibia
CETTEN&MED TO CAPTUFE
Capital City Invested by Austrlans
and Will Be Unable to Hold
Out Much Longer.
Rome, Jan. 12. Dispatches re
ceived hero today state that Cettinje,
the capital is being invested by Aus
trians and that the Mon
tenegrins are not only outnumbered
but are hampered by an insufficiency
of ammunition and supplies.
London, Wednesday, Jan. 12. Mon
tenegro is being treated to a .steam
roller attack similar to that which
crumpled up its friend und neighbor,
Serbia. The Austrian onslaught,
which has been a long time in prepa
ration, is now being prosecuted with
great violence, menacing several Im
portant positions close to the Adriatic
coast. '
The great Montenegrin stronghold,
Mount Lovceu, has fallen, according
to last night's Austrian official com
munication. The attack here has
been largely assisted by Austrian war
ships and the guns of the Cattaro
forts. In addition the Montenegrins
say the Austrian made abundant use
of asphyxiating gas contrivances.
A battle Is raging on Uie whole
the northern and eastern frontiers ol
Montenegro. On the east the Mon
tenegrins have been compelled to
evacuate Berane, on the River Dim.

country are in the hands of the Ger
mans; the consequence of which wa
that large shipments had to be made
from the United States and Cuba. Ii
both Germany and Austria the pro
duction in the past year had beei
normal. In pe-aco times, Germany ex
ported about 1,000,000 tons annually,
but she now uses up all her surplus
production at home, largely as foot
for cattle and as raw material fur tin
extraction of yeast and spirits. Mtre
over, the Belgian yield had beei
seized for the use of the German ar
mies and for the civilian populatioi
of the occupied parts of northeri
France.
On the whole, during the past year
sugar prices in the producing coun
tries of Europe have not advuncet
materially, except in the cases o
France and of Great Britain, whosi
government, immediately after Ger
many had prohibited the exportatioi
of sugar, had bought 1,200,000 tons o
the commodity at. high prices.
As regards the coining year, the
sugar production in France, the
speaker said, is estimated at onl?
130,000 tons, or less than one-quarte:
of the normal consumption. German?
even with the use of the Belgian crop
cannot produce more than barely suf
ficient to cover her people's needs
hence the oersistent inquiries for cat
tie fodder containing sugar. German:
can, however, also draw upon Austrl;
whose production is estimated at t
million tons, of which nothing is avai
able for export, except, perhaps, t(
Germany. Russia will have a poo:
crop and will therefore have also notl
ing for exportation.
On balance, Great Britain alone wil
need to import 1,800,000 tons, am'
France over 000,000 tons. All far eas
tern countries show a steadily In
creasing sugar consumption, and ac
cording to Dr. Geerlings, there wil
be a bare half-million tons availabh
for export from all countries oast o
Suez. Europe, therefore, has to loo)
for her main supplies to the Unitei
States, Cuba and the Antilles; bu
even taking into account tho export
able surplus from both North one
South America, there will still be i
deficit of roughly 500,000 tons. Shouh
tho war drag on for a long time, thi
European sugar production is certai'
to be reduced considerably, to thi
great benefit, of the cane sugar pro
duclng countries overseas.

National Committee Holds Stren
uous Session in Chicago
PRINCIPLES OF 1912 UPHELD
Fusion Idea Adopted After Vigorous
Opposition by Radlqal Party
Leaders.
Chicago, Jan. 11. Fusion with the
Republicans under certain circum
stances in the Presidential election
next fall Is advocated by the Progres
sive National Committee, which today
held a strenuous session in this city
and wound up Its deliberations with
the adoption of a 1,200-word pronun
ciamento which differs in its essent
ials only slightly from the 1912 plat
f6rm of the organization. The way
moreover, was paved for the possible
nomination of a Joint candidate for
President, other than Theodore Roose
velt. The committee voted to hold the
Progressive National Convention la
Chicago on June 7 at tho same time
as the Republican Convention. Can
didates did not figure in the discus
sions of she committee.
Every State In the Union but one
was represented at the meeting,
which was held in the Florentine
Room of the Congress Hotel, the
room in which Colonel Roosevelt
made daily speeches to his followers
at the time of the 1912 Republican
Convention. Mr. Perkins presided.
Some of the more radical Progres
sives opposed fusion with the Repub
licans on any terms. The arguments ,
of the leaders, however, carried tha
day, and when the declaration of prin
ciples was put to a vote the only dis
senting vote was that of Austin E.,
Griffiths of the State of Washington.
Mr. Griffiths later swung into line,
and made a motion by which the ac
tion was made unanimous.
