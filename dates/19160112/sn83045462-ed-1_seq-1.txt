with those eager for news of the j *
execution. The censorship im- j
posed shortly after the first news
of the affair came through shut
off all but the hare announcement 1
of what had transpired.
Final checking up by the American i
Smelting and Refining Company of its

According to information reaching [ j
pre. a special train hearing the J
"oreigners and several Mexicans left j (
Chihuahua City early the morning of j f
'anuary 10. It had hardly started on j
its Journey to the mining camp of Cusi- I ,
hulrischic, in the western part of the ,
state of Chihuahua, when a hand of (
Villa followers, said to have numbered .
twenty-eight, boarded the train and (
lined up the foreigners on the railroad (
tracks and a firing s?juad killed e'ghfeen
of them H'dines was said to have \
escaped by remaining behind as his !
companions were marched out of the 1
?iThe men were taken from the 1
train, robbed, stripped naked and lined '
up along the cars for execution. Holmes
fled into the desert for his life. With j I
fpet and body cut and bleeding from 1
stones and sharp cactus, he ran, with- 1
' out looking back, until he no longer 1
heard the whistle of bullets pass him or 1
the sound of firing. He succeeded in I
reaching friendly Mexicans, it is re- ?

Gives First News of Raid. I
The first news of the bandit raid was jj
received here through a cryptic tele- ^
warn from Holmes to officials of the
"melting company asking them to notl- 1
t\ his wife that he was safe.
Another version ^f the escape of ,
Holmes was received late today by
officials of the Mexican Northwestern
ailroad rn a message from officials at
'hihuahua City. It follows: I
"T. H. Holmes, a member of the party i
ivho oa<-Mned said that the train was ,
carded at 4 o'clock yesterday morning
hv twenty-eight armed Mexicans at i
Kilometer 6* According to Holmes.!'
ihe foreigners in the group were or- J j
it-red to alight. Holmes hid in the
> ivatory. From his hiding place, he
watched his companions being stripped
by bandits. They then ordered them to I
. arch toward the went. Holmes de- <
ended from the train and escaped in <
t ne darkness. I
In a few minutes he heard shrieks, imlediately
followed by a fusillade of shots, ]
. om the direction taken by the Ameri- s
ana and their capto~s." I
Holmes reached Chihuahua City Mon- i
?*> r.ight, according to advices. i
Satisfaction Demanded.
\ telegram asking that 1'resident Wil- '
demand full satisfaction from the

by a committee of mining men.
Many telegrams have come from Chili
uahua City from managers of mining
. rows, ordered back to the mines, stating
that they were returning to the border. j
It was reported from Juarez that Carranza
troops had been dispatched to Chi- 1
huahua City to bring the bodies of the i
victims to the border. Another report '
said government forces had been sent i
in pursuit of the Villa bands in western j

In the Senate an expected

that unless Gen. C'arranza

I i
While many members of the Senate i
a ere urging that nothing be under- i
aken until full details of the most ]
recent killing of Americans in Mex- ,
co can be received, there was a strong ]
undercurrent of feeling that some- '
thing should be "done to bring about 1
protection of Americans.
The Sherman resolution, which declares
ihat it is the sense of Congress that
the President should demand protection
of Americans and other aliens in Mexico
from the Carranza government, was
referred to the foreign relations com- ,
mittee of the Senate. The resolution
also urges that the foreign governments
which joined with the United
States in the recognition of the Car- [ '
ranza government now join with this i
country in demanding that Carranza i ,
protect all foreigners residing or trav- 1
eling in that country. Further, it j
urges these countries, in the event of!
this protection not being forthcoming,'
to join with the l.'nited States in in- J
tervention in Mexico. Finally, the I ,
resolution sets forth that the l.'nited j .
States, if it intervenes in Mexico, shall j '
leave the country again to the Mexi- !

Senator Calltnger of New Hampshire,

Holmes of Keetie, N. H.. asking the scnitor

Cites Past Warnings.
t
Secretary Lansing today telegraphed
(Sen. Carranza calling
for the prompt punishment of the
bandits who executed fifteen
Americans near Chihuahua Monday.
Through Eliseo Arredondo,
the newly appointed Mexican ambassador
here, it was arranged to
bring the bodies from Chihuahua
to Juarez today on a special train.
Secretary Lansing issued a
statement in which he said the
State Department "feels tliat it
took every possible precaution to
prevent Americans from exposing
their lives in a region where
guerrilla warfare is in progress"
mid that "it is to be deplored that
its advice was not folio ved.
"Every step will be taken to
~ee that the perpetrators of this
Jastardly crime are apprehended
tnd punished."
Secretary's Statement.
Secretary Lansing's full statement
ollows:
"In October, the department sent the
strongest kind of instructions to the
onsuls in the states of Chihuahua and
Sonora, calling upon them to use every
neans in their power to persuade
\mericans to Vjhv* immediately for
Jnited States territory, and these consuls
were instructed to employ special
"iders to carry this messa.ge to Americans
located in isolated sections. A few
came out. Some, regardless of the disurbed
conditions existing in Mexico,
jid not heed the warning.
"It was only two or three weeks ago
that Villa detained thirty Americans ir?
the very district in which the unfortunate
Americans now reported, killed
met their death. Great alarm was felt
Tor the safety of these thirty Americans
Recently the Villistas are said to
liave stated that they would kill Americans
in Chihuahua territory in order
l.o force American intervention.
Hearst Employe Executed.
"Within the past week or ten days
ihree employes of the Hearst ranch, in
Chihuahua, near the place where
Americans are now reported slain,
were reported to have been executed.
Two of these three employes made
their appearance at K1 Paso some days
ago, but the third appears to have
been killed.
"The department feels that it toook
every possible precaution to prevent
Americans from exposing their lives in
it reg on where guerrilla warfare is in
progress. It is to be oeplored that its
advice was not followed.
"Kvery step will be taken to sec that
the perpetrators of this dastardly crime
are apprehended and punished."
President Asks for Facts.
President Wilson was in communication
early today with Secretaries Garrison
and Gansing. and gave instruc
(ions to sena to me ?? nne uouse an
farm as rapidly as they were received.
Advices that at least fifteen Americans
were killed were received by Maj. Gen.
Scott, chief of staff of the army, and
also by the State Department.
At the White House it was declared
that while something undoubtedly
would be done, what steps the government
will take have not been decided.

Customs Collector Cobb at 101 Paso

divulge the sources of Collector Cobb's

Collector Cobb has been acting as a

CO-OPERATION

Recognize. However, the Necessity
of Co-Operation to Bring About
Defeat of Democrats.
The opinion of sonic of the republican
leaders her<^ privately
expressed today, was that the ac|
tion of the bull moose conference
in Chicago yesterday forecasted
an effort of the bull moosers to
hold up the republican party and
..11 fim.r ii.A r.?..i ,i?

j termination upon tlie- selection of
j the republican nominee.
It was not considered probable
| that this effort will succeed to its
I expected extent with the regular
! republicans, whose convention
will be held concurrently with
the bull mooscrs, although the.
sincerity of the bull moose leaders
in their wish to defeat the democratic
party is not questioned and
successful co-operation is confidently
expected.
Befuse to Be Dominated.
! The regular republicans, it was said,
do not intend to nominate a man who
will be objectionable to the progressives
who have left the bull moose and
returned to the old party as shown in
recent election returns.

a handful of hull nioosers will l>e allowed
to dominate the great mass of
the republicans of the nation.
One very practical advantage is seen
in holding the two conventions simultaneously
and that is that it will thus
be possible to bring republicans of all
classes into touch with one another
and permit private conferences and exchange
of views which in the enrl
might lead to better understanding.
The action at Chicago yesterday is
thought to have been the sequel to a
series of recent events in and out of
the political world, the motive of
which was the taking of practical
steps to defeat the democratic party
in 1916. Business as well as political
considerations entered into this motive.
As this object is dearest to the
heart of Col. Roosevelt, and as it is
realized that his co-operation is desirable,
he has been consulted.
Position of Col. Boosevelt.
One way of defeating the democratic
party Is to tyring about a friendly feeling
between the old line republicans
and all others. Politicians here said
today that they recognize that Col.
Roosevelt cannot throw his bull moose
overboard ruthlessly, although he hopes
81 the same time the republicans will
not take action which will compel the
animal to jump overboard !n despair
and cause him to leap after it.
Most republican leaders here are still
of the opinion that the colonel does
not expect to be nominated, as that
would be Inconsistent with hi* fixed
desire to defeat the democrats. He

elected even if a stampeded convention. !
elected largely by primary vote, should j
nominate him. as the old line republicans
would cut the life out of him at
the polls.
May Recognize the Colonel.
Xo one questions, however, the colonel's
desire to be a prominent factor
in the agreement upon a republican
candidate who would stand a show of
election'.
Xor is there disposition among the!
old line republicans to deny him the
gratification which this pose would
give him, or to minimize the immense 1
importance to the party if he would i
after the convention be able to utter !
his famous ejaculation, "Delighted!" j
over the nomination.
Some republicans at the Capitol think
that current happenings among republicans
of all ranks indicate clearly the
tendency which is assuming the force
of a tidal wave to agree upon a candidate
of a progressive type, yet not of
the hull moose type.
Who that man is will he determined .
at Chicago after full and free con-'
ference in which Col. Roosevelt will undoubtedly
figure, and it is predicted by j
many republicans that he will be ac
oeptable to Col. Roosevelt, and that
thereupon the little bull moose conven-l
lion will assent and all elements of!
the old republican party will bo re- i
united.

what Constantine said to Venizelos
about giving up Kavalla and the cablegram
Prince Danilo of "Merry Widow"

following these events the situation is
as easy to grasp as an eel that has
swallowed the hook and can't digest it.
For instance, Mr. Poneropolous, the
well known contractor who sells shoes
to the army, informs me the Greeks as
one man want war. They are even
prepared to fight for it. On tiie other

me no patriot would again plunge

| LONDON". January ij.?The
announcement of the occupation
bv Austrians of Mount Lovccn in
Montenegro, although it i? not
confirmed from entente sources, is
generally accepted here as true.
Uneasiness, which already is
expressed freely in Italy, is reflected
in the English and French
newspapers. The loss of Lovccn,
from the point of view of the allies,
is serious, owing to the fact
that its submit dominates Cattaro
bay, the Austrian naval base.
Forestalled by Austria.
Before Italy entered the war the
French had established a number of
Runs on the mountain and had prepared
emplacements for fieavx guns
which could have swept the hay.
Austria, by seizing it. forestalls this
danger and is in a commanding position
with regard to Cettinje. the capital
of Montenegro, which is a little
over six miles distant, although sheltered
by intervening mountains.,
The Austrian advance, considering:
the distance to be covered, was much
slower than that made in the Teuton
conquest of Serbia, but in consideration
of the formidable obstacles which the
mountainous character of the country
| presents, it is conceded that the invadj
ers are making steady progress
Italy Had Big Stake.
The question is being anxiously raised
as to why the entente allies did "Ot
long ago send aid to the Montenegrins.
i and in particular why Italy, which Is
more acutely affected by this Austrian
invasion, had not taken preventive
1 measures.
The Austrians are now only ten miles
from the capital of Montenegro. <alculating
the distance over the existing
roads, and a successful blow at the
heart of the country may have the effect.
it is said by military critics, of
isolating the troops who are defending
the northeastern frontier.
Germans Hold Slight Gain.
In Champagne the Germans hold a
slight gain made as a result of the determined
offensive of last Saturday and
Sunday. The French military authorities
say that the German forces w Inch
delivered the attack lost heavily, as
with three divisions they advanced in
face of the French artillery fire, which
took a terrible toll.
From the eastern front it is reported
that a comnarative lull at present prevails.
Special dispatches affirm that
the Russians have beep so successful
in consolidating their new positions

which they had established in preparation
for the advance which they intended
to make in the coming spring.
Austro-German Retirement.
TJte Aust ro-Germans appear to have
abandoned hope of the recapture of the
territory lost in the recent fighting;,
according: to the Morning Post's Petrograd
correspondent. and as a result of
Kussian pressure a general evacuation
of the forward bases b\ both Germans
and Austrians is proceeding vigorously.
"For months past," adds the correspondent.
"they have been accumulating
immense stores for a spring advance.
Vladimir-Volynsk> i was the
forward base of the Austrian armies
and Kovel of the German armies. At
both places enormous storehouses of
beams and corrugated iron Have been
built, and when tin- Kussian advance
began they were tilled from floor to
roof with military stores.
"X,he Kovel magazines are now being
hastily evacuated to t'lielm. and the
Vladimir-Yolynskyi magazines to Sokai.
These removals have been seriously
hampered by the simultaneous removal
of tens of thousands of wounded in
the recent fighting.
"The Bourse Gazette's Itvinsk correspondent
reports that the Germans
also have uegun the evacuation of
Poniewcst h. in the Baltic provinces,
from which everything valuable is
being loaded into motor lorries and
hurriedly conveyed to Shavii. L#ihau
and the interior of Germany. The Zeppelin
sheds near the town also h;iv?

Imperial Guard in Attack.
CHABOXS-Sl'lt-MARXK, France, January
31, via Paris, January 12. - The
fact that regiments of the Imperial
Guard were ^mong the fiO.GOO men that
attacked the French lines in Champagne.
Sunday, indicates liovv carefully
the Germans selected their troops for
this great assault. A considerable number
of prisoners taken by the French
belonged to the famous guards.
The attack followed one of the heaviest
bombardments the Germans lave
yet inflicted on the French positions. It
iasted twenty-four hours. The promptness
of the French reply with concentrated
fire from their three-inch guns
stopped the first waves of the attack
011 the parapets of the derma n
trenches. Only at the fourth attempt
did the Germans, aft.?r heavy losses,
get up to the French trenches.
The surprising promptness of the
French counter-attack caught the Germans
before they could organize th?
positions th?ey had won. Many wer**
obliged to surrender and only a few
got back to their own lines.

on German positions north of La Mesnil,
