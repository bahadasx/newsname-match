White House Fears Fresh At
tack on "Watchful
Waiting" Policy
|
Washington, Jan. 12. The
Mexican situation has been
brought to the boiling point again
by the execution of the sixteen
or more Americans near Chi
huahua. In Congress, at the
White House and at the State De
partment to-day it entirely dis
placed the submarine controversy
and all other international aaffirs.
Secretary Lansing after send
ing a demand for satisfaction to
General Carranza, issued a state
ment declaring it was to be de
plored that the Americans had not
followed the State Department's
warning against exposing their
lives in the guerilla warfare
region, and adding: "Every step
will be taken to see that the per
m Detrators of this dastardly crime
ire apprehended and punished."
Storms Break in Senate
In the Senate, an expected
storm broke as soon as it as
sembled. Senator Sherman, Re
publican, introduced a resolution
proposing that unless General
Carranza gives proper protection
to foreign life and property the
United States should invite the
Pan-American nations which
have been associated in the Mex
ican negotiations to join in re
storing ord erand government in
Mexico.
Senator Sherman's resolution was
read lo the Senate, and without com
ment or discussion of any kind was
referred to the Foreign Relations
< 'ommittee.
In the House Representative Dyer,
Republican, presented a similar reso
lution calling on the president to in
loi-m Congress if he did not helio\o
the time had come to abandon the
"watchful waiting" policy. Otlier
members gave notice or their inten
tion to make speeches. Hie adminis
tration was not without its defenders.
Mho gate notice that they would sneak
also.
Show Concern
While tin- White House and the
state Department exhibited evidences
or concern, there was no indication
10-tlay of proceeding further than
calling upon General Carranza to
punish the bandits who executed the
Americans and to give proper guaran

BE DAUPHIN MAN
H. J. Simmons, Contractor of
Up-River Town, Believed
io Be .Victim
LIVED AT EL PASO J
Employed by American Smelt
ing Co., Whose Men Were
Murdered
In Ihe list of mining men reported
(alien from a train in Mexico,'stripped
and Killed by a firing squad of Mex
ican bandits, appeals the name of;
"R. If. Simmons, master mechanic,
El Paso. Texas. '
Relatives of It. J. Simmons, a eon-i
tractor from Daupliin, fear that the i
dispatch refers to liim, as he has heavy
interests in Mexico, was employed by j
the American Smelting Company, tin- 1
der whose employ were all the men;
shot, and for the la-si tive years has j
made his home in El Paso.
F. C. Gerberich and H. 1. Gerberich, |
brothers-in-law, of Dauphin, base t heir 1
fears on the fact that Simmons had j
contracted several years ago to build j
the new $1,000,000 smelter plant of i
the American company in Cusihuiri-J
achic. When the latest revolution;
worked its way around to this district
two years ago Simmons, with the rest ;
of the Americans there, was forced to!
flee across the border to El Paso. Con- !
trading lools and equipment valued at !
many thousands of dollars were left:
behind.
Naturally, under the circumstances,
he would be anxious to get beck at the
first opportunity to see how his equip
ment fared, relatives believe, and they
have but slight hopes that the R. H.
Simmons referred to is not H. J.
Simmons.
Mr. Simmons was born in Dauphin.
Me was about 35 years of age and suc
ceeded his father in the contracting
business. About five years ago he
started work In Mexico and was iden
tified with the construction of the in- (
ternational bridge across the Rio
Grande at El Paso.
With his wife and daughter. Eliz
abeth, he spent the summer of 1912
with his mother at Dauphin. I-lis rela
tives are anxiously awaiting news of
his fate from his wife and a daughter,
who are at El Paso, Texas.
Band of Villa Men
Boards Train and Shoots
American Passengers
El Paso, Tex., Jan. 12.—With the
expected arrival here to-day of the
bodies of the 19 foreigners, most of
whom were Americans, executed by
former Villa soldiers Monday near San
Ysabel, 50 miles from Chihuahua City,
details of the tragedy were eagerly
awaited by hundreds of mining men
and others formerly active in in
dustrial affairs in northern Mexico.
Telegraph offices and other sources of
information were crowded throughout
the night with those eager for news
of the execution. The censorship im
i mediately imposed shortly , after the
j first news of the affair came through,
i shut, off all but the bare announce
| ment of what had transpired.
Final checking up by the American
j Smelting and Refining Company of
| its employes to-day showed 19
foreigners unaccounted for. Ttventy
| foreigners were reported to have been
lon the train only one of whom,
Thomas M. llolmes, escaped. Fol
j lowing is the revised list, which was
'issued by the smelting company:

I Of these Couch was a Canadian and
Romero a Mexican.
I According to information reaching
here a special train bearing the
twenty foreigners and several Mex
icans left Chihuahua City early the
morning of January 10. It had hardly
started on its journey to the mining
camp of Cusihuiriscliic, in the west
ern part of the State of Chihuahua,
when a band of Villa followers, said
to ltave numbered 28, boarded the
train and lined up the foreigners on
the railroad tracks and a firing squad
killed them. Holmes was said to
have escaped by remaining behind as
his companions were marched out. of
the cars. Just as the firing squad
raised their rifles, he fled along the
railroad track in the direction of
Chihuahua City, which he reached on
Monday night.
A telegram asking that President
Wilson demand full satisfaction from
the Carranza government was sent to
Washington by a committee of min
ing men.
Many telegrams have come from
Chihuahua City from managers of
mining crews, ordered back to the
mines, stating thai they were re
turning to the border.
In the midst of the excitement Gen-1
cral Manuel M. Mcdinievlatia, Villa's j
former chief of staff, suspected of Im-1
plication in the killing of Peler Keane I
near Madera recently, was arrested
and held in the city jail on a charge
of vagrancy.
It was reported from Juarez that
Carranza troops had been dispatched
lo Chihuahua City to bring the
bodies of the victims to the border.
Another report said government
forces hail been sent in pursuit of the
Villa bands in western Chihuahua.

LOSS OF LOVCEN
IS SERIOUS BLOW
TO ALLIED FORCE
Summit of Mount Now in Aus- ;
trian Hands Dominates
Cattaro Bay
CAPITAL IS IN PERIL
Only Ton Miles Away; Tempo
rarily Lull Prevails Along
Eastern Front
By Associated Press
London, Jan. 12. The announce
ment of the occupation of Mount
I Lovcen In Montenegro, although it is
I not confirmed from entente sources, is
| generally accepted here as true,
i Uneasiness which is already freely
I expressed in Italy is reflected in the
j English and French newspapers. The
I Joss of Lovcen, from the point of view
jof the allies, is serious owing: to the
fact that its summit dominates
Cattaro bay, the Austrian naval base.
Before Italy entered the war, the
French had established a number of
| suns on the mountain and had pre
| pared emplacements for ehavy suns
which could have swept the bay.
Austria, by seizing it, forestalls this
j danger and is in a commanding posi
tion with regard to Cettlnje, the
capital of Montenegro, whlen Is a
little over six miles distant, although
sheltered by intervening mountains.
The Austrian advance, considering
the distance to be covered was much
slower than that made in the Teu
ton conquest of Serbia, but, in con
sideration of the formidable obstacles
which the mountainous character of
the country presents, it is conceded
that the invaders are ma King steady
progress.
Scaring Capital
The question is being anxiously
raised as to why the entente allies did
not long ago send aid to the Monte
negrins, and in particular, why Italy,
which is more acutely affected by this
Austrian invasion, had not taken pre
ventive measures. The Austrians are
j now only ten miles from the capital
of Montenegro, calculating the dis
tance over the existing roads, and a
successful blow at the heart of the
country may have the effect, it is said
by military critics, of isolating the
troops who are defending the north
eastern frontier.

Wilmington, Del., Jan. 12.—The fifth

I disturbed the entire western section

i The fourth blow-up in the two days
occurred at the Carney's Point, N. j.,

is known as the "solvent recovery,"
and, while about 13 tons of powder
were destroyed, nobody was killed or
injured. The Du Ponts do not appear
to have any suspicion, and they at
tribute both explosions to unavoid
