When He Meets Her on the
Great Northern at Hilo
When the steamer Great Northern
docked at Hllo yesterday, Horace W.
Vaughan, district attorney for Hawaii,
not only greeted his daughter, his

surprise which, for a moment, 'took
his breath away, as some of the pas,
.sengers put It
Mr. Vaughan's daughter, who is a
strikingly pretty girl of 18 years,
sprung the surprise. Soon after the
district attorney, had boarded the ves
sel and the customary greetings had
been exchanged, his daughter drew
him aside and whiswred something
into his ear. She explained how, just
before she and 1 er mother and grand
mother had left their home in Tex
arkana, Texas, for the coast she had
been married to Dr. J. S. Moulton, a
very prominent young physician.
. Pressing business prevented Mr.
Vaughan's new son-in-law from com
ing to Hawaii with the rest of the
family, but he may make the trip
latter. y-For the next month or more.
Attorney Vaughan and his family will
occupy Judge R. P. Quarles' home in
Keeanmoku. Mrs. M. O. Morris of
Texarkana accompanied Mrs. Moulton

Bonfils of Denver Speaker
Last year Spokane, which has for
years been advertising on a large
scale through the Chamber of Com
merce publicity committee, put on ex
tra steam and spent tens of thousands
of dollars on a campaign to get East
erners bound for San Francisco to
take the northwestern route to the
coast, ."through the cool aiumnar play-
ertnmcrof North America," as one or
their catch-phrases had it
Today members of the Honolulu
Ad Club heard from Waldo G. Paine,
chairman of Spokane's publicity com
mittee, and traffic manager of the
Spokane & Inland Railway, of tha
I'road guage manner in which the
northwestern city went after the tour
1st business.
"Years ago they did not advertise
their towns and cities In. a conscious
way," said Mr. Paine, who arrived this
morning on the Great Northern.
"They used to hold the time-honored
belief that cities, like Topsy, 'just
grew,' and that was all there was to
it. - .; . '
One. Stagnates One Grows.
"Now we know that two given
towns, or sections of territory with
equal advantages as to location, cli
mate, natural resources and each with
equal opportunities In every funda
mental particular, may reach the part
ing of the ways, one to stagnate and
remain forever a village, o, a section
wit ha dwindling population, the oth
er to march forward to greatness. .
"I need not tell you the reason.
'You all know what can bring such
things about It's men. There is the
civic equation, if you will pardon my
coining the expression, Just as there
is the personal equation.
"The failure to advertise cities ' is
now just as much a thing of the past
as is the stone age only It isn't so
far in the past - Each one now adver
tises and does it consciously. What
are you men here today for? I shall
