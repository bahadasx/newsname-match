Snow Shovelers Make up
List of Victims—Horrible
Scene After Crash.
Brandon, Man., Jan. 12.—
Seventeen men were killed
and 15 injured in the Ca
nadian Pacific railroad yards
in Brandon at 10 o'clock this
morning, the result of a col
lision between a snow clears
ing train and a heavily laden
stock train.
The victims were engaged
in clearing- snow away, and
were iu the caboose which
was being shifted to another
part of the yard.
Sixty men were in the ca
boose at the time the stock
train hit it head oil, plowing
through the mass of human
ity."
The scene which followed
was indescribable, dead and
dying being piled in heaps.
It was 50 below zero at
the time.
The snow plow was standing when
the heavily laden stock train dashed
into it. The stock train was going at
such a rate it made a clean sweep of
all obstruction before it. A heavy fog
at the time accounted for the colli
sion, as it made it impossible for those
in charge of the stock train to sco
what was before them until it was too
late.
Hundreds of foreign women from
flats are on the tragedy scene trying
to "find the remains of their husbands
or sons, or to secure some informa
tion regarding them. It is almost im
possible to identify the remains. Some
of the bodies are hopelessly mangled
and heads, legs and arms, with froz
en and congealed blood lying about,
make a most gruesome spectacle im
aginable, in 50 degrees below aero
weather.<p></p>MUSIS

Noon Hour Temperature of

With a record of I5 degrees below

temperature being SO degrees from 12
o'clock till 2 o'clock, the lowest noon

university weather observation bureau,
was experienced.
Tonight will be even more severely
cold than last night, the forecasts
calling for a drop that doubtless will
bring the temperature, down to 40 de
grees, or probably even lower, accord
ing to H. E. Simpson, director of the
weather bureau at the university.
The Minnesota forecast, which
more closely defines conditions in

ELABORATE PLANS
Capital of Montenegro, Six
Miles Away, at Their
Mercy.
British forces under Gen
eral Townsend have made
several sorties from Kut-El~
Amara on the Tigris, each
time being repulsed with
losses, says the Turkish war
office. The official commun
ication makes definite asser
tion that this force is sur
rounded. The Turks also
claim a decisive defeat, with
losses of a British relief force
coming up the Tigris, 20
miles down the river from
the surrounded troops.
London, Jan. 12.—Announcement
of the occupation of Mount Lovcen in
Montenegro, although it in not con
firmed from entente sources, is gen
erally Accepted as true here.
Uneasiness which already is freely
expressed in Italy, is reflected in Eng
lish and French newspapers. The loss
of Lovcen, from the point, of view of
the allies, is serlotis, owing to the fact
that its summU^yominates Cattaro
bay,' the AurtrlanJjui.val base.
Before ftaly wW .•th«v wax, the
Freticli had. eataMRfted'a number of
guns on the: mountain,-and had pre
pared emplacements for heavy guns
which would have swept the- bay.
Austria, by seizing it, forestalls this
danger, and is now in a commanding
position with regard to Cettinje, the
capital of Montenegro, which is six
miles distant, although sheltered by
mountains.
Progress is steady.
The Austrian advance,. considering
distance covered, is much slower than
that made in the Teutonic conquest
of Serbia, but, in consideration of the
formidable obstacles which the moun
tainous character of the country pre
sents, it is conceded that the invaders
are making steady progress.
Why No Aid?
The question is being anxiously
raised as to why the entente allies did
not long ago send aid to the Montene
grins, and particularly why Italy,
which is more acutely affected by the
Austrian invasion, had not taken pre
ventive measures.
May Isolate Troops.
The Austrians are now only ten
miles from the capital of Montenegro,
calculating the distance over existing
roads, and a successful blow at the
heart of the country may have the
effect, it is said by military critics, of
isolating troops defending the- north'
eastern frontier.

Through Vlieso Arredon

At the White House and also at the
state department, there is unconceal

foreign policy and its recognition of
Carranza.

Washington, Jan. 12.—Senator Lawrence Y. Sherman, of Illinois, republi

Paris, Jan 12.—The Havas corre

graphs that the Belgian government
is about to lodge a protest with neu
tral governments against the new
German war levy of 40,000,000 francs
monthly, in addition to last year's tax
of 480,000.000 francs.
The Belgian protest, the corre
