EXPLAINS SINGLE TERM PLANK.
to Candidate or to
Ooantry for a Oopstitnti^ual Amend -
tls Rook, Ark., Jan. 7.?William
McCombe, Democratic national
chairman, In a statement here today
declared the "second term plank"
concerning the presidency In the last
Democratic platform was not a man?
date of the Baltimore convention and
may be construed either as a recom?
mendation to the candidate or as a
recommendation to procuring the
passing of a national constitutional
amendment.
Mr. McCombs appealed for imme?
diate military and naval prepared?
ness on the part of the United States
'against possible encroachments of
I European powers after the European
I war/'
"The United States will be the
richest country in the world after the
wsr," said Mr. McCombs. "Any of
the European powers will look with
covetous eyes upon the wealth of the
i United States. There is a possibility
that, irritated by poverty, they may
be led to make incursions against the
peace and good will of the United
States. We must be prepared to re?
sist that.
"I favor the creating of a naval
power in the United States; the equal
of that boasted by any power on the
globe.
GET COTTON TO GERMANY.
Pope Outlines Texas Farmers' Union
I Plan.
Washington, Jan. 7.?President H.
H. Pope, of the Texas Farmers' Union,
outlined today to congressmen from
the cotton States the unlon'u plans for
shipments of cotton to Germany by
way of Sweden. Ho said the cotton
would be concentrated at Houston,
that the first ship would sail February
I, and that regular sailings were plan?
ned. The cotton would be shipped,
Popo said, in ships owned by a na?
tive-born American citizen, and will
fly the American fir g. The cotton has
been sold for 27 cents a pound de?
livered at destination, and will net the
farmers about 20 1-2 cents.
The market price Is about 12 cents
and the British government has been
paying that for cotton seized. Inas?
much as Great Britain and Germany
both have put cotton on their contra?
band lists, this latest move may re?
vive v.ne contentions of the United
State? against their action.

MUCH CAPITAL AFFECTED BY
PROPOSED LEGISLATION.
Chairman Kitchin Announces Hearing
January 14, When the Whole Ques?
tion of Dyestuffs Famine Will be
I Opened Up.
Washington, Jan. 6.?Hundreds of
millions of dollars of capital invested
in various industries are affected by
proposed legislation to develop the
dye stuff industry in the United States,
on which Chairman Kitchin, of the
house ways and means committee, to?
day fixed a hearing for January 14.
The whole question of the dyestuff
famine, growing out of the shutting
off of the supply from Germany on
which vigorous represenatlons have
been made to the State department
for relief by American manufacturers,]
will be opened up at the hearing
which was arranged by Representative '
Hill, of Connecticut. The hearing!
will be on the Hill bill to put protec?
tive duties on chemicals and dyestuffs
so as to induce American capital to
build up a dyestuff industry at home.
Some of the Democrats in the house
served notice today that when the
time comes to take up the revenue
legislation, they will refuse to vote
tax on gasoline, stamp tax on bank
checks and some of the other propo?
sitions and that the expenditures for
preparedness must be met mainly
from the income tax without lowering
the exemption limit, leaving the bur?
den on the higher incomes.
A bill to incorporate the Playground
and Recreation Association of Ameri?
ca, which, headed by Joseph Lee, of
Boston, as president, annually raises
and spends $100,000, was introduced
today by Representative Gardner, of
Massachusetts. The purpose is to
give the association a nation-wide
scope.
Minority Leader Mann strongly en?
dorsed the Ferris Conservation bill,
; an administration measure, from the
floor of the house today after It had
been opposed by several Western Re*
? publicans. Democrats applauded him
? vigorously. The measure which would
WA inlt and -granting of -*Q*year Isaac*,
on 19,000,000 horsepower of unhar?
nessed water .and divide the proceeds
between the State and federal govern?
ments has the endorsement of Secre?
tary Lane and other authorities on
j the water power situation, Mr. Ferris
explained in presenting the measure.
COTTON IN WAREHOUSES.
j Increase of 7,000 or 8,000 Bales in Co?
lumbia?Rise in Price Necessary to
Move.
Columbia, Jan. 7.?Estimate by a
< Columbia cotton man yesterday was
that there are now stored in Colum?
bia between 7,000 and 8,000 more
bales of cotton than ever before.
Within the last few years ware?
house facilities have been greatly en?
larged, and the total bulk now stored
here Is considerable. It was further
emphasized that the tendency to hold
is general, and that approxlintacly 40
per cent, of the total cotton crop is
either held by the farmers or in the
hands of speculators. Farmers are
, inclined to believe that prices will
reach another high level with the ap?
proach of spring when the market1
will again become active. A middling
12-cent basis might be an induce?
ment to sell, one buyer pointed out|
yesterday. Middling was quoted in
Columbia at 11 3-8 cents yesterday.

CONSTRUCTION FOR COLUMBIA
STARTS IN JULY.
Preliminary Drawings of Colombia
Office Made?Treasury Department
Ca" for Funds for Commencing
Wurk.
Washington, Jan* 6.?Representa?
tive Lever today ascertained from the
supervising architect's office in the
treasury department that the prelim?
inary sketch for the new postofflce at
iColumbia had,been made.
Work on the building will be begun
shortly after July 1, 1916. For the
fiscal year 1916-1917, $84,000 has been \
asked by the treasury department, j
the department figuring that only ;hat'
part of the total appropriation can toe
used during the year.
Mr. Lever secured an appropriation
in the public buildings bill for 1913
for a new postofflce for Columbia to
cost $265,000, exclusive of the site,!
which cost $75,000. To the uninitiated
it might have seemed that the depart?
ment has been dilatory in commencing
construction, but this is the case with
all federal buildings.
The actual construction follows the
purchasing of the site by something
over three years, such delay being due
to the system of construction pursued
by the treasury department and Rep?
resentative Lever has been behind this
matter ever since he secured the ap?
propriation, in order that the Colum?
bia office should have its rightful and
natural precedence in the consider
ition of the department.
TO REGULATE IMMIGRATION.
Smith Introduces BUI in Senate for
Literacy Test.
Washington, Jan. 6.?Senator E. D.
Smith of South Carolina, chairman of
the senate committee on immigration,
today introduced in the senate a bill
to regulate the immigration of aliens
to and their residence in the United
States. The bill is the same which he
introduced in the senate during the
last congress, and which, after some
SA.W- ? ? ~ ? v ^ A ***m*~ jaMMMjl
in' the senate last winter, but met its
fate at the hands of the president In
a veto message to congress. An at?
tempt was made at that, time in the
house to pass the measure over the
veto of the president and this failed
by a few votes.
The opposition in the senate to the
bill during the last session, while
small in numbers, was most vigorous
and resulted In a somewhat long
drawn out filibuster against the meas?
ure. Senator Smith, however, at that
time engineered the measure over the
opposition and feels certain that he
will be able to press his bill to a
successful passage In the senate at
this session.
Senator Smith has sought In the
preparation of the present bill to
make the immigration laws not only
selective but restrictive in character.
To his proposed measure he has given
special attention and thought to the
administrative details and has made
the machinery for the effective en?
forcement of the law as nearly perfect
In every particular as possible.
He has retained in the bill the
"literacy test" as a means of further
restriction of indiscriminate immigra?
tion. It was this'feature of the meas?
ure of last year that caused the presi?
dent to veto it. Senator Smith hopes!
to get early consideration and pas?
sage through the senate of the bill.
