FRANK IRAN HER
FOR 45.000 PURSE
SHEFFIELD GETS
A DECREE; WIFE'S
Court Says Her Own Lips
Convict the Authoress of
Desertion.
REFERS TO 'DREAM BOY.'
Inference That Mysterious
.Youth May Have Been
Present in Person.
Vice Chancellor Vivian Lewis In
Jersey City to-day gave td Justus
Khfllllcld a divorce from Itena Car
Sheffield for desertion, and denied
the application of Mrs. Sheffield for
a divorce for non-support, desertion
nnd cruelty.,
When J. Hansbury Callaghan, at
torney for Mrs. Sheffield, had finished
malting his argument on tho evidence,
Vice Chancellor Lewis turned to Mcr-
rttt Kmc, counsel for tho husband.
"It Is unnecessary for you to make
an argument, Mr. Lane," he said. "I
shall award a decreo to Justus Shef
field u lid Ictivo thu daughter, Bar
barn, In the custody of the mother.
Thcso are both persons of bright
minds, Mrs. Hhcllleld's cleverness
wns shown In a book In which It was
shown that her Ideal man was an
other than her husband. If that idaal
man actually exists and if he haa
been In the courtroom I shall not
speak of that. Tho woman Is guilty
of desertion by her own lips when
slie testified hero: '1 want to flee from
him.' -iter statements regarding his
treatment of her were not corrobo
rated sulllclently."
Neither the Vice Chancellor nor
anybody else in the courtroom would
undertake to s.iy who was meant by
Vice Chancellor lewis's pointed Inti
mation that tho "Dream Hoy" might
havo been among tho spectators of
thn trial.
As soon ns the Vlri Chancellor
maxio known his decision Mr. Hhef
field leaned over to Mr. Iine. his
counsel, and said: "To-morrow Is my
birthday, and tho winning of this case
and absolution from all the charges
made against mo by my wife Is the
greatest present I could havo re
ceived. I hope tint decreo 1s signed
to-morrow."
Mrs. Sheffield nearly fainted when
she heard tho words of Vlco Chan
cellor Lewis. With n firm hand sho
gripped the arm of an attendant and
commenced to nob, Her face aguln
lightened when It was announced that
sho would make a good mother to
Harbara anil would havo possession of
tho only child.
Mrs. Sheffield produced to-day the
munuscrlpts of her three books. "The
Golden Hollow," "Romany Road" and
another not yet published, in obed
ience to a subpoena sorved by Mer
rltt Lane.
After reading the book Mr, Lone
askotl:
"Mis. Sheffield, have not you attrib
uted to a character of this now book
all tho qualities which you attributed
lo 'Muo' In 'Tho Golden Hollow?'"
"Mao" was u, pen portrait of Justus
Hhelttcld as his wlfo saw him. It was
not attractive.
"I shall only say," replied Mrs.
Sliclllflld, "that I was ordeied to wrlto
i Ills book from a point of view dia
metrically opposite to tho plot of
'The Uolden Hollow.' "
Her Jifarers assumed that tho new
book portruya man's Ideal of u woman
as tho 'Dream Hoy' was supposed to
be woman's Ideal of a mini.
.1, Ilanamiry Callaghan, attorney
for Mrs. Shelllold, in his summing up
spoke bitterly of Sheffield's cruelty

WASHINGTON, Jan. 1!.-The Mex

Chihuahua. In Congress, at the
White House and at thn Mate. De

in tho House. Representative. Dyer,
Republican, Introduced a similar reso.
lutlon, calling on the President to In

tho time had come to abandon thn
"watchful waiting" policy. Other
members gavo notice of their inten
tion to make spool-lies. The Adminis
tration was not without its defend
ers, who gave notice that they would
speak also.
"Ho It resolved," says the text of
Senator Sherman's resolution, "that It
Is tho aeuso of tho Senate, tho House
concurring, that tho Government de
mand of Carranzn, who has recently
been recognized as tho head of an es

"That the other governments In the

"It is further resolved to bo tho

Although tho Introduction of Sena

out debate, the speech-making broke
out later when Senator Gallinger. the
Republican leadei, declared the time
for.watchful waiting had passed, and
that the United States now must take
somo steps to protect tho lives of
Americans in Mexico. He read a
communication from tho State De

WILSON ORDERS ALL FACTS
ON MURDERS SENT HIM.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12. Secretary Lansing to-day telegraphed
Gen. Carranza, calling for the prompt punishment of the Villa bandits
who executed seventeen Americans near Chihuahua Monday. Through
Eliseo Arredondo, the newly appointed Mexican Ambassador here, It was
arranged to bring the bodies from Chihuahua to Juarez today on a spedil
train. Official despatches from Chihuahua to the State Department to
day say the bodies of the victims arrived at that dty last night Arre
dondo has received confirmation from Carranza sources of the execution
of the Americans and has asked for further details. His advices are. the
first confirmation from Mexican sources.
At the White' House and at the State Department there was uncon
cealed anxiety over the situation and
Mexico might be made tiie veliicle for further attacks by the opposition
in Congress upon the Administration's foreign policy and its recognition
of Carranza.

House all facts as rapidly as they
were received. Advices that at least
sixteen Americans were killed were
received by Major Gen. Scott, Chlee

At tho White House it was declared
that whtlo something undoubtedly

Secretary Lansing's only announce,
ment on the case was that the UaHcd
States would look to Carranza "for sat

the United States will take depends
upon developments of the facts.
At tho state Dopartmom officials

which wcro then regarded as Villa

at Casas Grandes.
An otllclal list of the dead received
by the State Department agrees with
the list contained In the news de

Secretary Lansing later Issued a
