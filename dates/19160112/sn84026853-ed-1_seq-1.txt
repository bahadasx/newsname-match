CALM CONGRESS
WILLING TO WAIT
ADMINISTRATION LEADERS ALLAY
EXCITEMENT OF BODY.
DAILY TALK CONTINUES.
Washington, Jan. 9.?After a week j
of open discussion in the senate and i
house, congressional excitement over I
the foreign relations of the United
.States has been considerably allayed.!
Administration leaders appear to
have succeeded in prevailing upon
most of their colleagues to adopt a
policy of patient waiting for complete
investigation of recent war
zone incidents in which American
lives were lost. |
It is certain, however, that there
'will be almost daily discussion at the
capital for weeks to come of the conditions
affecting the United States as
a result of the European war now
that the bonds of restraint have been
broken.
Senator Hoke Smith, of Georgia,
author of the resolution which asked
direct inquiry into the British
treatment of trade, has given notice
that he will address the senate this
week on phases of the cotton situation
as alxected by Great Britain's
n+fif-nrlo Senator Smith and other
members of congress today received
cablegrams from the American Association
of Commerce and Trade in
Berlin praying for action to assist
American firms there declared to be
facing ruin because of the British
blockade. i
Thinks of Home Folk.
"I did not pay much attention to
the cablegrams," said Senator Smith.
"I am not interested in Americans in
Berlin. I want something done for
Americans who stay at home. I
^ant American citizens in the Untied
States to have their rights. Eventually
tne foreign relations committee
of the senate will undertake deliberations
of all matters pertaining
to the European conflict wnich it has
before it, including proposed investigation
in British interferences
with neautral shipping and belligerent
attacks upon neutral vessels in which ]
American lives have been lost or im- ?
periled. The committee planned to ;
begin the task last week, but deferred ]
o/?+inti rvor>Hino> -furtVior Hinlnrnat.ic '
negotiations by the State Department
with foreign powers.
Deliberation on the subjcct of na- ]
tiona! preparedness is fairly under <
way in both houses of congress. The j
leaders agree that it will be many
weeks before any definite idea can j
be formulated as to the naval and
army bills This week the senate com- .
mittee on military affairs will begin ;
a hearing on army reorganization, ;
the house committee having begun j
hearings last week. Revenue legis- ;

that it would be useless to discuss

to indicate how much money will be ]
needed.

Entire Community Mourns Lots of
Valuable Citizen
I
Mr. James W. Huckahee, of Lowndesville.
S. C.. died at his home in
that place, on bst Sunday afternoon,
at 5 o'clock, and was buried at Smyrna
cemeterv on Monday, 10th, inst.
at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
Mr. Fuckabee was eighty years ;
old at the time of his death. At one :
time he was in the mprcantile businecs
pt Lowndesville, S. C., but he
ver.irf-d from business some years a^o.
TTe was a consistent member of the
Methodist church for many years.
During" the War Between the States,
he was a gallant soldier in the army '
of the Confederacy.
For manv years Mr. Huckabee was
Lowndesville correspondent of .
this paoer. His letters were always ,
readable, and he was always prompt
in pending them in. He had a style
which was his own, and he was a ^
good ; news-gatherer. His letters
we'-e read by the peonle everywhere !
with interest. We shall miss him, .
as will our readers. i
Mr. Huckabee is survived by his ;
wife, three sons. Messrs. J. G. Huck- j
abee, Moseley Huckabee and Elias J.
Huckabee, and by one daughter, Mrs. .
Will Thomson, all of Lowndesville. (
He is also survived by a brother, Mr.
Jouette W. Huckabee, of Georgia, i
and one sister, Mrs. F. W. R. Nance, \ '.

Messrs Julius H. DuPre and Frank C. ,
DuPre, of this city. J
A good man has gone to his reward.
DEATH OF MRS. R. G. HEMPHILL, i
Mrs. Jessie Culver Hemphill, wifei1
of Mr. R. G. Hemphill, died at their j!
home in Aurora, Colo., last Saturday i.
morning at three forty-five o'clock, 'j
January 8th, 1916, after an illness
of two weeks with grip.
News came to Abbeville several 1,
days before Christmas that Mrs. j(
Hemphill was very ill and then :,
Christmas day that "Jessie was oet
ter." After this nothing was .
heard until last Friday and the mes- I
sage came that she had grown worse ]
and there was no hope. Saturday (
morning the news came that death
had c,ome as a relief from her suffering.
Mrs. Hemphill has been in failing
health for many years and has
sought many climates in the hope of
being made well and strong. Three
years ago she came to Abbeville and
spent several months at the home of *
Mrs. R. R. Hemphill, hoping that the j1
sunshine and balmy air of the1
South would give her a new lease on i1
life. By her sweet attractiveness, !J
her accomplishments, her gentle man- 1
ner, she endeared herself to all P
with whom she came in contact, and !
these friends and relatives of the 1
South, grieve with the disconsolate 1
husband, the parents and family, 1
that one, in whom the love of life 1
was strong and who found it so !
bright and beautiful, should have to 1 j
jive up and pass into the great Un- j'
known. | ]
Mrs. Hemphill was the fourth j
child of Charles Richard and Clara J
Rockefellow Culver, and was born '
at Carson City, Mich., July 5th, 11
1887, and was therefore in her twen- |
ty-ninth year. She was educated ;J
at the Carson City High School and ' ?
was especially accomplished in 1
music and drawing. After finish- J
ing at the High School she taught 1
one year at Blackmere District in
Bloomer Township, and it was here
that her health begun to fail. She
went to Silver City, New Mexico,
and spent a year ana returncu numc i
feeling herself well. Her health
failed again and she went to Canon '
City, Cal. It was here she met j
Mr. Hemphill and thoy were married |
Aug. 3rd, 1910, at the home of
Mrs. Louis Hemmerle, and they have
made their home at Canon City,
Monte- Vista, and recently at Aurora,
Col. Each conscious that they
could not live in any other climate,
they have clung with love and tenderness
to each other and their married
life has been happy.
Mrs. Hemphill comes of brave and j
substantial stock, her father being a
native of Ringwold, Kent, England, |J
spending his youth in the city of ,1
London, and coming to America at |1
the age of seventeen. He settled 1
in Carson City, Mich., and was one 1
of its leading merchants and for 1
several years was postmaster at that 1
place. He is a descendent of Sir
Robert Rook, who was Knighted for j
bravery displayed at the taking of j ]
Gibraltar. The Culvers also were j <
conspicuous for bravery in the Cri- i
mean War. <
Mrs. Culver comes from the pio- ]
neer settlers of Maryland and Ohio, .<
her father being Irving Rockefellow <
and her mother, Mary De Crique, of 1
French descent.
Mrs. Hemphill was taken to the <
home of her childhood for burial.
She is survived by her father andj;
mother, and two brothers, Francis . i
and Chester Culver, and two sisters, |i
Misses Grace and Mary Culver. For j
the past year Mrs. Culver has lived 1
with the young couple and has been !
constant and faithful in her care and
attention. Mr. Culver was spend- [
ing the holidays in Aurora and was
with his daughter in her last illness.
The sympathy of his boyhood i
friends go out to the young husband '
in his sore distress.

NEGOTIATIONS SEEM
Vffl SATISFACTORY
UNITED STATES AGAIN THE
WINNER IN DIPLOMATIC CONTROVERSY
WITH TEUTONS
1
Washington, January 8.?Encouraged
by the conciliatory .attitude
shown by Germany and Austria in
recent diplomatic exchanges with the
United States, officials are considering
requesting a definite and comprehensive
statement pledging not
only Germany, but all of the allies,
to repect in the conduct of their pea
warfare the guarantees as to the
safety of American lives, for which
this Government has contended.
President Wilson is being urged
by some of his close advisers to ask
the Germanic allies for definite nrsurances
that no unarmed ships with
Americans aboard shall be destroyed
by any of them until the passengers
have reached a place of safety. The
President is said to look with some
favor upon such a proposal, but has
reached no decision. In any case he
probably will take no steps until details
of pending negotiations have
been cleared up.
Officials are gratified over Germany's
latest note on the destruction
r>f the American ship William P.
Frye, made public to-day, because of
its acceptance of the principle that
the mere placing of non-combatants
in lifeboats before a prize is destroyed
is not a sufficient guarantee
of safety.
This concession, coupled with the
officer of Germany to pay indemnity
for the Lusitania victims and Ambassador
Von BernstorfTs assurances
regarding the conduct of German
submarines in the Mediterranean, has
contributed greatly to the feeling
1--A-* - A -i-1- _ ; a* t_l
cnat a solution 01 tne enure pruoiem
might be near at hand. This hope
is strengthened by Austria's deference
in the second Ancona reply and
the assurances of Baron Zwiedinek,
the Austrian charge here, that if it
developed that an Austrian submarine
sank the liner Persia he had no
doubt personally that full satisfacfaction
would he given.
No further details regarding the
Persia incident reached the State
department to-day.

;hese meetings the fertilizer situation
.vas talked over and the benefits of
in orchard were discussed. A field
neeting was held at the farm of Jasper
Smith, and a demonstration in
aruning and the care of fruit trees
>vas given. Later on when more
light classes have been organized,
Mr. Barton and Mr. W. W. Long, of
Slemson, will come to Abbeville and

;welve men subscribed to a fund to
)uy community spray pumps to be

Mr. Cheatham has recently visited

ind girls to. join the pig clubs. He

"COL. LYON AND STAFF."
We have before us a photograph
;aken of U. S. Marshal, Chas. J.
Lyon, and his "staff." The picture
,vas made in the office of the Marshal,
n the Federal Buildirg, in Greenville.
The Marshal is sitting at a
landsome mahogany desk, with a
Arire basket full of mail at his right.
He is dressed in the latest fashion,
ind the "shine" on his shoes shows
jp more than anything in the photo
*raph, except the handsome young
ady on his left, to whom he is dictating
a letter. The Marshal sits in
i slightly reclining position, with his
eft hand on the back af his head,
vhile he has in his right a paper from
which he is dictating. His mustache
is fully curled and he looks as
oious as he usually does when going
to church on a beautiful Sabbath
morn.
Standing around him in the background
are his four deputies, Messrs
Murph, Eruce, Adams and Moore.
Charley Bruce is the best looking
nan in the set, which leaves nothing
slse to be said, except that friend,
Murph seems to have a "bead" on a
still somewhere in the office. Col.
Clarence Payne is at his desk, ready
to do the needful, if it is needed.
The office is fitted up as only Un;le
Sam can fix things. There is
a fine carpet en the floor, and the
Pnfriifnro ic? oil f molinffir v QC 1C
i uj uilui t AO au vi iiiaiiv^ai..j uu iu
the woodwork of the office about
the windows, etc. The office looks
some better than the old Sheriff's
office, in the Miller Hotel, which Col.
Lyon occupied some years ago.
Judging by the picture we would
say that the Marshal is running
things according to the latest style,
and if we were a moonshiner, we
would be prepared to surrerder on
first notice from the force jf deputies
shown by the Marshal.
GENERAL ASSEMBLY
NOW IN SESSION
CALENDAR OF 137 BILLS AND
RESOLUTIONS FOR HOUSE
AND 101 FOR SENATE.
Columbia, January 8.?Special:
When the General Assembly meets
on Tuesday there will be presented to ,
the members on the House side a
Calendar with one hundred and thirty-seven
bills and resolutions, and
the Senate Calendar will show one
hundred and one measures pending
for immediate consideration. As
this is the second session of the Assembly,
there will be no occasion for
the expenditure of time in perfecting
an organization, all of that machinery
having previously been provided
for. Both branches can get toe work'
without delay, but as a general rule ;
a week or ten days is taken in get-,
ting matters adjusted and talking
over conditions in general. Many ,
of the bills that are pending will be
the bills that are pending will be replaced
by new measures; others are
unnecessary on account of the lapse
of time and some are out of date.
The general rule is that bills are reassigned
to committees with a view
of readjusting them to new conditions
and to have the measures printed.
There are, of course, many of the
bills that wilL no longer be necessary.
For instance, a bill that last year excited
a great deal of discussion was
one by Mr. Charles, relative to the
establishment of dispensaries in small
communities. The abolition of the
dispensary has made such legislation
unnecessary at this time. In the
same way Mr. Hutto's bill relative
to the management of the dispensary,
in Dorchester County is no longer
necessary. Mr. Christensen's bill,
which is on the Legislative Calendar,
relative to the reorganization of the
historical commission, will be dropped,
as the scope of his measure has
been provided for in the present law,
and so thore are other unneccessary
proposititons on both the House and
Senate Calendars.
Unsold Liquor.
Conditions generally change from
year to year. Last year the dispensary
legislation figured to some extent;
this year it ought to be of minor
importance. The most important
phase of the liquor situation will be,
first, how to dispose of the stock of
unsold liquor; second, whether there
should be a State tax to provide for
the enforcement of the prohibition
laws, or whether each county should
pay the expenses of enforcement in
the immediate county; third, whether
there will be any further tightening
of the prohibition laws'with respect
to the violation of the present statute
and the reduction of the amount of
liquor that an individual can bring
into the State.
The tax commission statute promises
to offer the most interesting con-1
sideration of the session. There are
going to be various angles to this
contest all the way from a repeal of
the statute to the non-confirmation
of the present board. From the
present outlook this promises to be
the most intense contest of the session;
although there is some likelihood
of compromise on the whole
proposition.
Another question that is likely to
attract considerable interest is relative
to defining the oosition of the >
State in connection with tho development
of State Park, which is the outof-town
section of the State Hospital
for the Insane. At present there
are those who advocate the policy of
concentrating all of the development
of the Hospital for the Insane, at
State Park, and not spending any
money except that which is absolutely
necessary for the upkeep on the 1
plant in the city of Columbia . And
then there are those who think that
it is best to have two well developed ;
plants, one in the country for the
colored, and one in the city of Columbia
for the white patients.
Economy Ahead.
Although the State is regarded as
being in a most prosperous and healthy
financial condition, there is going
to be an extreme effort to hold appropriations
within the present levy,
and the ways and means committee
and finance committee are going to
have to exercise considerable care in
view of the increasing demands and
growth of the State to keep the ap- j
propriations within the present levy,?
and at the same time properly re-1
spond to the legitimate demands of
the public.
The matter of good roads at this:
time is likely to be one of consideration
at the approaching session.
There have from time to time been
various measures considered relative
to the establishment of a central
road commission. Unfortunately'
conflicting views have prevented anything
being done. There is a plan'
to raise revenue ior me support 01:
this commission, and some of its!
work, by a license tax on automo-1
biles. The hitch has come from the!
differing: opinions as to whether the |
automobile license fund should be,
expended in the country in which it,
is paid, or whether it should go into
a general State-wide fund. If an
agreement can be reached on this1
phase of the matter, it is thought
possible that a State commission will {
be provided for this year. I
ANNUAL MEETING

Abbeville Building and Loan Association

On January 5th, the share-holders
of the Buliding and Loan associaton
of Abbeville, held their annual meeting.
The report of the Secretary and

had increased during the year.
When it is taken into consideration
that this money is gotten together
from a good number of people, the
payments averaging from $5 to $10,
we think that it will show that the
association is doing a good business.
It is helping a number of people to
save small amounts each month,
which amounts begin to bear interest
as soon as they are paid in.
The Building and Loan Association
of Abbeville, S. C., was organized in
May 1907, with a paid in capital of
$500.00 and authorized capital of
$100,000.00. The association started
with one series of 500 shares. The
organizers were Messrs. G. A. Neuffer,
R. S. Link, L. W .Dick, W. P.
Greene, J. M. Lawton, J. S. Stark, H.
B. Wilson, R. L. Dargain, C. C. Gamhrell.
and Joel S. Morse.
Dr. G. A. Neuffer was elected president,
Mr. R. S. Link, Vice-President,
Mr. L. W. Dick, secretary and treas.
Mr. W. P. Greene, attorney. The
other gentlemen with the president,
vice-president and secretary constituting"
the board of directors. In the
fall of 1908 Mr. Dick resigned as
secretary and treasurer and Mr. Joel
S. Morse was elected to take his place.
The assocntion had only one series
until July 20th, 1909, when the second
series was issued with 145 shares.
Since then there have been two series
issued each year. One on July
20th and the other January 20th.
The first series matured in February,
1914. Out of the original 500
shares?/426 ran to maturity, although
more thAi 500 shares were issued altogether
in this series. The 426
shares at maturity were worth $42,600.00.
$12,000 of this amount had
been borrowed at this time the notes
and mortgages were cancelled, and
the remaining $30,000.00 was paid
out in cash. In March of this year
the second series will mature, with
100 shares, worth $10,000.00, about
$3,000.00 of this has been borrowed
and the remaining $7,000.00 w'll be
paid in cash to the share holders.
From now on there will be two
series maturing each year. One in
the spring and one in the fall.
The Association has fourteen series
in force now and will issue the fifteenth
on the 20th of this month.
Since its organization the association
has loaned 175 people money
to buy, or build homes, or make
some investment, and it has helped
many more to save up their money
with which they have made investments.
There are 1,244 shares in force today,
and the authorized capital has
been increased to $500,000.00, The
share-holders at this meeting elected
the following board for the ensuing
year: Messrs G. A. Neuffer, R. L.
Dargan, J. F. Miller, C. C. Gambrell,
H. ti. Wilson, u. ?1. MCMurray, ?. kj.
Perrin, J. F. Barnwell, and J. S.
Morse.
The board of directors elected
the following officers, Dr. G. A.
NeufFer, Pres., Mr. R. L. Dargan,
Vice-President; Mr. J. S. Morse, Sec.
and Treas., and Mr. W. P. Greene,
attorney.

ALLIES FORCED 10 i
ABANDON GALLIPOLI j
'"1
NEWS RECEIVED WITH PANG OF
REGRET BY PEOPLE OF .
ENGLAND.
London, Jan. 9.?The remaining
positions held by the Allies of Gallipoli
peninsula have now been abandoned
with the wounding of only one
man among the British and French,
according to a British official statement
issued tonight.
This news has been expected for
several days by the keener observers
of the Near Eastern campiagn, for
the retirement of the troops from
Anzac and Suvla bay three weeks ago
left no strategic advantage to the retention
of the tip of the peninsula.
Nevertheless, the news will be received
with a pang of regret by the
' people of the British Isles, as well as
the colonies.
Renewed activity of various kinds
noted by the Turkish official com
munications in the past few days
! has probably been in the nature of
preparations for the final act of the
Dardenelles tragedy. Tonight's Turkish
official statement, covering the
! period from Thursday to Saturday,
records increasing effectiveness of
the rcinforced Turkish batteries,
which have been drawing in and con- 1
. centrating on the Allies remaining
. positions.
Another pang to the British public
i will be caused by the announcement
tonight of the loss of the battleship
King Edward, VII, which has been
blown up by a mine. The brief official
statement on this subject does
not reveal the scene of the action and
merely says that the disaster occurred
in a heavy sea, despite which the
entire crew was saved before the ship
went down.
The King Edward VII represented
an investment of nearly 1,600.000
pounds and was one of the finest of
the last class of pre-dreadnaughts,
corresponding in gvucrai w we
American ships of the New Jersey
and Nebraska type, and was only
slightly older than the Natal, which
was sunk by an internal explosion
about a week ago.
On the west and east fronts there
have b$en no developments of large
importance over the week-end. The
German communication announces
that the Germans have completed the
recapture of positions on Hartmans
Weilerkopf taken by the French, a ^
few days before Christmas.
Greek correspondents continue to
assert that the Bulgarians and Germans
are hastening plans for an attack
on Saloniki, but the Austrians
are fighting hard against the Russians
and Montenegrins and the Bulgars
are largely occupied in a resolute
attempt to reach the Adriatic,
from which they are only 40 miles
distant, at Elbassan, Albania.
England's internal affairs are quiet,
pending the reassembling of parliament.
There will be a full dress debate
on the compulsion bill Tuesday,
with David Lloyd-George, minister of
munitions, and Arthur Henderson,
labor member who has just resigned
from'the cabinet, as the probable
star speakers. Sir Henry Dalziel,
who has been one of the most consistent
critics of the government, also
will give his reasons why he supports
the government on this matter.
The Labor party will meet early
in the week to consider its position.
Unless, however, opposition to the
bill develops, a sti-ength of which
there is no indication now, there
seems, small likelihood that the government
will feel need to appeal to
the country.
GOES TO GREENWOOD.
A partnership in business has been
formed between J. E. Summers, of
Greenwood and James C. Hemphill,
of Abbeville, as architects, and Mr.
Hemphill has gone to Grenewood to
live. Mr. Hemphill has been very
successful in his chosen work while
in Abbeville, and has proven himself
to be an architect of rare taste, skill
and ability. He took high general
honors in drawing at the College of
Charleston some years ago. He has
worked at the Edison Labratory in
Newark, N. J., as a draftsman, and
has studied and worked in Boston
for a year or two.' Mr. Summers is
a young man and is meeting with
success. The friends of both hope
that success will crown their efforts.
POPE-ANDERSON.
Mr. Paul E. Anderson and Miss
Sara Pope, daughter of the late ur.
