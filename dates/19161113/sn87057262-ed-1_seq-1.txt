Ending the Somme with buried artil-
to tiheir assaults, the French and
British are attacking only the surface
!f the greatest fortifications in the
orld. ..
Germany built a surprise for the
lilies in her wonderful seriee. of
irtillery-proof fortification*. These
iefensea are built so close, are dug
|o deep and cover such a wide area'
what the allies are today attack
ig •with Infantry, tank® and artillery,
•e only the outskirts of a powerful
[ygtem of underground forts.
The bombardment Is terrific. Fields,
roods and towns are torh to pieces
constantly exploding shells. But
rnder ground nothing is touched.
And it is from ber »uk-surface forts
that Germany Is' repelling the allied
attack.
For a week I feftve been over the
Somme battlefield. From a height
near Peronne and to the south of
Arras, our party twice penetrated the
ehell area, viewing Peronne and Bap
aume, the two immediate objects of
fire. It marked the first time since
the Somme battle began that a neu
tral has been permitted to inspect
this part of underground fortifications
constructed by the Teutonic forces.
While waiting in the library of a
castle serving as the headquarters of
one of the commanding generals, the
windows rattled and doors shook
from the concussion of bursting
shells.
With these constant explosions in
oar ears and escorted by an intellig
ence officer, we motored to the
heights of Bapaume. There we watch
ed the British fire on the town.
Only one Church spire and one chim
ney is still standing.
Although in approaching the front,
we encountered seventeen lines of
trenches and wire entanglements, the
Somme battle is no longer being de
fended from the trenches, but with
buried artillery. For miles as we
walked we passed holes in the ground
large enough for men to crawl into.
These were the entrances to thous
ands of underground forts which the
Germans have built in an endless
chain.
The underground defenses vary in
depth from a few feet to as much as
eixty feet.. No cannon yet invented
can penetrate them. And this is the
reason, German officers explain, why
the English cannot destroy the de
fenses.
Not a house, a barn or a whole
tree Is standing in Achietlepetit. Our

[By Robert 'J. Bender, United Press

WASHINGTON. Nov. 13.—President
Wilson was back at work in Wash
ington today. He faced a vast job
which must be cleaned up rapidly.
Pending receipt of a message from
CharleB Evans Hughes, conceding
democratic victory in the election,
the president withheld any announce

next four years. He had intimated
to immediate friends, however,, that
he will issue some statement upon
receipt of Hughes' congratulations.
The president will start work very
soon on the message to congress to
be read when that body re-convenes
next month. Continued doubt as to
the composition of the house and as
to which party will hold the balance
of power, including the speakership,
is staying the hand of the president

LIBEL SUIT

Afternoon.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
•RED OAK, Iowa, Nov. 13.—Fifty
veniremen were present today when
Judge J. P. Rockafellow's court
opened to hear the 190,000 libel suit
of State Senator F. F. Jones against
Burns Detective J. N. Wilkerson, but
adjournment was taken at 11:30 to
1:30 p. m., without the case formally
Being opened.
Wilkerson today filed eighteen type
written pages of a plea in mitigation
of damages, reciting virtually all the
evidence he produced before the Vil
lisca grand jury, which failed to in
dict Jones for any alleged connection
with the famous axe murders in 1912.
Jones and his attorneys were in con
ference all morning. The conference
caused many rumors. It was said
dismissal of the suit was being con
sidered and again that a change of
venue to Council Bluffs might be
asked.
Wilkerson and his attorney, W. E.
Mitchell of Council Bluffs, were in
court prepared to proceed, they said.
Wilkerson reiterated his willingness
to attempt to prove his charge that
Jones inspired the murders in the
house of Joe Moore, his business com
petitor.
Wilkerson's plea In mitigation
asked that the case be dismissed and
the costs assessed on Jones.
