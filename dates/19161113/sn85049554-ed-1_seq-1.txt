LOSS OF HOUSE

President Hopes to Finish Railroad
Eight-Hour Legislation and Other
Matters Before Now Congress Con
vsnos Tumulty Not 'to Become
Member of Csbinet—Reported Resig
nation of MoAdoo Denied.
Washington, Nov. IS.—(President
Wilson was back at his desk in the
White House today after an absence of
two months, prepared, to taJce up Im
portant foreign questionC^These in
cluded the German submarine situa
tion and the Mexican problem.
.The president was expected to con
sider Ant the submarine situation,
which is admittedly serious. A sum
mary of recent developments prepared
by the state department was ready to
be laid before him, and, in addition, he
probably will confer soon again with
Ambassador Gerard on the situation.
Concerned Over Loss of House.
Altho iMr. Wilson was tired out when
he returned to tue White House last
night he was up early today. He took
up his mail,- accumulated during his
trip to Williamstown, Mass. The
president asked first on the latest in
iuruiaUuii uu Uie poiiUcai makeup of
the 49use of representatives iny the
Sixty-tfifth congress. He was told in
dications from present returns were
that the republicans would .have 217
members and the democrats 212, with
six members of other parties. The
president was understood to be much
concerned over the makeup of the
house chiefly because of its effect on
the selection of the speaker and chair
manships of. committees, which he is
anxious to see in the hands of the
democrats.
As far as legislation is concerned,
Mr. Wilson is confident that most
measures fostered by him would gain
sufficient republican support to carry
them thru.
Mr. Wilson refused to m%ke any
comment on the election, pending word
from Mr. Hughes or the republican
committee conceding his election.
MoAdoo Haan't Resigned.
There have been reports circulated
regarding1 changes, in _the 'fcabineUJMi£
officials declared today that it Ifal
most certaltnle.-will urge all. the pres
ent members of the. cabipet to remain
at their posts and changcs are not ex
pected unless members themselves de
sire to retire.
It is considered possible, however,
that one or -more members may resign
for personal reasons. Secretary Mc
Adoo has been mentioned as likely to
resign, and Representative Carter
Glass, of Virginia, chairman of the
house banking and currency commit
tee, has been mentioned for his place.
It was denied today that Mr. MoAdoo
has offered .his resignation.
In case there is a vacancy in the su
preme court, Attorney General Greg
ory, Secretary Lane or Senator Walsh,
of Montana, would be considered first
for the appointment.
No Cabinet Job For Tumulty.
Secretary Redfield, Secretary Baker
and Secretary Daniels also have been
mentioned as members of the cabinet
who might desire to quit public life,
but it was stated today that none uf
hem had signified any such intentions.
Secretary Tumulty will remain
1
at
his present post, altho he could be ap
pointed a member of the generar hoard
of appraisers' of New Tork If he de
sired. It was stated with authority to
day that he will not 'become a cabinet
member.
To Push Legislative Program.
Because of the probability that the
next house will be republican, the pres
ident is laying plans to secure much
legislation as possible, during the short
session next month. The measures he
desired passed are the enlargement of
the interstate commerce commission
and creation of machinery for prevent
ing in the future a crisis similar tp that
recently threatened to Involve the coun
try in a railroad strike, and other leg
islation suggested by him when the
strike threatened.
The president has begun work on his
message to^congress.
Concede Loss of House.
Democratic leaders in Washlngtop
have already privately conceded tyB
control of the next house to the repub
licans. Altho they are announcing to
the public that the result Is yet In
doubt they are well satisfied within
their own minds that the republicans
will have a majority.
The 1,500 or so employes of the house
whose Jobs depend on. democratic con
trol are already casting about for other
positions, and the republican congress
men are already at work pulling wires
for prominent committee places.
Out of the 435 congressmen, the best
figures now obtainable give the repub
licans 21? and the democrats 210. There
are five independents who will
aligned.with one. slue or tije other and
three .districts are yet In doubt.
Can't Win Independents.
If the democrats gained all three of
these districts they yould still have to
get the votes of all the Independent
member* in order to control. This, they
admit! they can not do.
The five independents are Schall, of
Minnesota progressive Martin, of
Louisiana, protectionist Fuller, of
Massachusetts, independent Randall,
of California, prohibitionist, and Lon
don, of New York, socialist' Of this
number, Schall and Martin are almivrt
certain to vote with the republfoans.
London and Fuller would probably vote
with the democrats, while.Rdndall, who
will/be a new member, is not known to
'7.f rasfcm-..., .,
be affiliated with ^either party.
Republican congressmen who are
now in Washington admit that with
their slender working majority In the
paxt house they will be able to do lit
tle. They anticipate that the adminis
tration will be able to put thru most
of its projects, altho they feel certain
that they will be at\le to block any
purely partisan measures.
Can Block Revenue Bill.
They figure that they will be able
to ckuae a lot of trouble when the
democrats attempt to pass their rev
enue bill and they feel- that they may
be able to take out many of the pres
ent items of this bill and insert protec
tive tariff itema in their place*. They
expect to have supportf rom a number
of southern congressmen on certain
tariff items.
The republicans also feel that they
will be able to block an spproprlatlon
for the shipping, board and may be able
to put the board out of existence. They
also think that they may be able to
block an attempt to start work on a
government armor plate plant, altho
they admit that some of their members
might rebel against this plan.
NO CONTEST
BY
Candidate Will Aoeept Retuma aa
Shown by Offioial Canvass.
New Tork, Nov. 18.—Charles Evans
Hughes will let ills telegram of con
gratulatlons to Ayoodrow Wilson await
the official count of the votes in Cali
fornia, New Mexico, North Dakota, New
Hampshire and possibly one or two
other states.
If the official count confirms the Wil
son victory apparent now, it is the re
publican nominee's wish—and he is the
one wjho, being mainly concerned, has
the final say—that there be no contest
or court proceedings.
Hughes now has 243 votes in the elec
toral college about which t'here is little
doubt. The republicans figure Minne
sota will also be his, bringing his total
to 255^ That Is 11 less than the 26A
majority required in the electoral col
lege. If a recount should show New
Hampshire republican, bringing the re
publican total to 269, and Hughes
should gain several of California's elec
toral votes on & split electorate, pos
sible under the state laws, he would
arrive at the place where North Da
kota's five votes, or New Mexico's three,
recounted and found republican, might
put him over instead of Wilson.

evidencejyas not yet at .hand on which
to base action. He said no information

While sfate dtifcttrttribnt officials con
sider the submarine situation as serious,
no decision/had been reached today as
to whether Germany has violated
pledges given to the American govern
ment after the attack on the channel
steamer Susbcx.
All recent submarine acts, including
the raid of the U-'5'3 on the New Eng
land coast, are being considered at the
state department, together with an ef
fort to determine whether a new sub
marine policy has been adopted by
Germany.
No new developments in the Mexican'
situation were reported to the presi
dent by Mr. Lansing. While it is un
derstood that Mexican relations are not
in a satisfactory state, the commission
at Atlantic City will be given a thor

cording to latest returns available. To
day the figures stand 178,569 for Wilson,
to 178,819 for Hughes in the state. The
latest guardsmen's vote heard from
was that of Fuirmouth county, whose
troops voted 21 for Wilson to 11 for
Hughes. This gain of ten for Wilson
cut the Hughes lead to 260. It is likely
that the work of tabulating returns will
begin at the state capltol today.
Two more county soldiers' votes, re
ported today, cut the Hughes lead in
Minnesota to 229. Troops from Brown
county voted 27 to 16 in Wilson's favor,
and iMartin county's soldiers 21 for
Wilson and 11 for Hughes, a net gain
of 21 #or Wilson. The total now stands:
