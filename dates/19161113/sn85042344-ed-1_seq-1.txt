BITTER FIGHT FOR
TRADE EXTENSION
Nations in South America
Have Been Hard J I i t ;
Now Come Back.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 12. Full de
tails of the recent propositi to
the Brazilian parliament by the Bru
lilinn society of international law, for
the formation of u leuKue of neutrals
tr. resist trado restrictions and other
encroachments by belligerents, were
marie public here today through the
official Gazette of the Brazilian parli
ament. The proposed league would
consist of all present neutrals and
would spring automatically into effect
whenever another war broke out.
The society, in an exhaustive report,
fovieWH the constant encroachments
by belligerents upon neutral trade and
ni-Res the government to take immedi
ate steps to secure the co-operation
ol all neutrals for the declaration of
a uniform series of neutral rights and
lor the enforcement of the same.
Suggest Rights.
The tights suggested are the im
munity of enemy goods under a neu
tial flag, complete liberty to trade be
tween neutral nations regardless of
Ultimate destination, freedom from
any extra territorial actions such us
blacklisting, and the forbidding of any
alien to inform a foreign government
o! matters which might lead belliger
ent restrictions.
Violations of these rights would be
met under the plan, first by the with
drawal by the neutral nation, includ
ing the trade rights. In case a con
sular or diplomatic official should he
concerned, his credentials would be
handed him at once. If this proved
unavailing, hostilities might follow.
Directed at British.
The report, while directed at bellig
erents on both sides In the present
war. Is more .concerned with Hrltish
trade violations. The efforts of the
Vnlted States are recognized, hut are
declared Ineffective. 1 .ie allied block
ade Is particularly criticised. A case
is cited in which a Brazilian vessel
from the I'nlted States to Brazil is al
leged to hnve been seized, taken Into
Martinique, and forced to surrender
some of its merchandise.
The Brazilian report created great
Interest In official circles here. South
American nations have been hard hit
by British trade restrictions, and some
time ago an official announcement
was made In Chile that the Chilean
ambassadors to the I nlted States,
Brazil and Argentina had been re
quested to seek joint action on the
iprltlsri blacklist. rne state oopari
ment here, however, says that as yet,
reither the Chilean nor the Brazilian
proposal has been definitely submit
ted.

LAB EDO. Texas, Nov. 12. Nearly
one hundred persons, including men,
women, children and Carranza, sol
diers, were killed November 7 In an
attack by Zapata followers on pass

BITTER FIGHT
SURE TO COME
NEXT SESSION
Republicans Will Control
Congress by Narrow
Margin.
SPEAKERSHIP FIGHT
TO BE A FIERCE ONE
Republicans Will Probably
Select James II. Mann
to Succeed Clark.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 12. Mem
bers of the house of represen
tatives In the newly elected Sixty
fifth congress face one. of the most
uncertain organisation situations in
the history of the government.
With a few districts still in doubt,
the Republicans appear to have a
plurality of four or five members and
a possible majority of two or three
when it is figured that an Indepen
dent elected in Massachusetts and a
Progressive elected in Minnesota
probably will vole with them for or
ganization purposes. Independence
of action has characterized a num
ber of the re-elected members on the
Republican side, however, and their
attitude toward Democratic legisla
tion in the last few years have given
Democratic lenders cause for hope
that some of them might carry their,
independence In the organization of
the next house.
On the fuce of the unofficial re
turns the political division of the
house is so close that an effective ami
certain working majority does not
exist. While there might be a few
changes when the official returns are
counted, the chances are that these
would not materially alter the gen
eral result. In view of the situa
tion, it is regarded by Democratic
leaders as Improbable that President
Wilson will call an extra session of
tho new congress next spring. In
that case the organization fight will
not come un'il the regular session in
December, 1917, which will mean
maneuvering for more than a year
In the contest for speakership of
the house and the organization of
Important committees.
Mann May Move I'p.
As matters stand today the can
didate of the Republicans for speaker
will be James 11. Mann, tho present
minority leader, and Speaker Clark
generally is regarded as the Demo
cratic choice to succeed himself. Al
ready, however, there aro rumblings
of uncertainties because of the close
political division. on the Republi
can side there are reports of riisaffec
tlons against the minority leaders and
candidates for speaker, on the part
of members who, it Is suggested,
might vote for Clark instead. Con
sequently, there is gossip among sumo
Republicans regarding the advisa
bility of naming another man as
candidate for speaker if one can be
found upon whom the Republican
membership could unite.
As the Democrats apparently will
be In the minority, some of tho
friends of Champ Clark are not cer
tain that he will be a candidate to
succeed himself.
1'nless he can be elected speaker
they prefer thnt he abandon the race
anil become a candidate for minority
leader, the post ho held for many
years before the Democratic ascend
ency In 1912.
Such a development might pre
cipitate a lively contest within the
Democratic ranks with Claude
Kitchln, tho present maturity leader,
and Speaker Clark as rival candidates
for the minority leadership.
The congressional result In New
Mexico is riouhtful, the chances now
favoring the Democrats. In Pennsvl
vania there are tw districts and pos
sibly thr'e, where the soldier vote
when counted, may change the re
sults. In two of these Republicans
and In one a Democrat have been
elected by small majorities on the
face ef the returns fhus far reported.

ATLANTIC CITY, N. J Nov. 12.
Hope that an agreement on tho pro
gram lor tho restoration of umicuhle
relations between Mexico and .the
Cnited States might bo reached by
the Mi'Xi un-American Joint commis
sion this week was revived by a con
ference today at Philadelphia between
Luis Cabrera, chairman of the Mexi
can commission, und Rafael Nieto,
subserrotury of the department of fi
nance of Mexico, of w idth Mr. Cabrera
is the chief.
Mr. Nieto came directly from tho
Mexican capital. It was Intimated
that ho had couui to the I'nlted St iles
principally to confer with his chief
on the subject of the new schedulo of
mining taxes In Mexico.
It is believed here an agreement
entered Into by the coniimsloners for
border control may have the effect of
securing for tho Carranza government
a loan, although It may not be for a
large amount.
This money. It is believed by those
Identified with the American commis
sion, will place Generul Carranza In a
position to pay his troops and enable
him to conduct a more vigorous and
effective campaign against Villa and
the several other rebel leaders new
threatening the continuation of his
power.
The presence In the I'nlted States
of Mr. Nieto was take by some as
an Indication that the monetary
phase of the situation was being dis
cussed by hi and Mr. Cabrera, al
though tho Mexicans Insist that they
have asked for no loan.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 12. Presi
dent Wilson came back to
Washington tonight, ready to take up
waiting public proplcms ami begin
fiuiuing plans for his ..-.. ml term in
the White House.
A cheering crowd walled to wel
come the president. As he appmircri
with .Mrs. Wilson, hundreds began
shouting and rushed forward 111 ef
forts to shake his bands.
Mr. Wilson walked through the sta
tion with his hat off, bowing ami
smiling. Secretary Baker, Attorney
General Gregory, Secretary Tumulty
and Senator James of Kentucky wero
among those who greeted him.
The president was assuieil by Sec
retary Tumulty that there bail been
no change In t lie result In California
and that there was a chance of bis
capturing the electoral vole of Minne
sota. Tho president, however, Is not ex
pected to Indie ale his ow n atilude to

conceded to the Republicans.
Hack at Desk Today.
Mr. Wilson pulil no uttent Ion to ini
tial business tonight, hut tomorrow
will bo ut his desk. One of the first
problems to be laid before him will
lie the situation resulting from recent
activities by German submarines. Sec
retary Lansing Is expected to lay be
fore hlm a summary of recent data
dealing with the Marina, Columbian,
Arabia and linuo cases. No secret is
made of the belief of some officials
that tho situation is serious.
The president has made It clear to
friends that the policy toward sub
marine warfare laid down In the notes
to Germany, concluding with the
correspondence on tho Sussex case,
will bo followed strictly. In bis cam
paign speeches he declared that In
case the administration was defeated
at the election. It would have difficul
ty dealing with foreign problems be
tween now and March 4. Now, that
he has been re-elected, however, he
Is known to feel that his ronrse. gen
erally, has been approved by the na
tion, and that he can proceed with a
free hand.
Mr. Wilson probably will have an
other Conference 111 tho near future
with James W. Gerard, American em
bassador to Germany, who has been
ill this country for several months.
The president also will take up con
sideration of the Mexican situation
prompt ly.
A number of important appoint
mments are to be marie soon, but
some of them may be postponed until
congress convenes. They include the
members of the tariff commission, the
shipping board, several federal Judges,
anil a board to administer the woik
liigmcn's compensation law for fed

York and Chicago also are to be ap
pointed. Reports that the president has ile

salri tonight by officials to be prema

may not remain In the president's of
ficial family lifter March 4, officials
insist that he has not yet even con

When Mr. Wilson returned tonight
he found awaiting him thousands of
telegrams and letters congratulating
him on his i e-eleetlon. If possible he
will read them nil.
