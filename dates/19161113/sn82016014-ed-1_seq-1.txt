GIVEN TUMULTUOUS GREETING
Bands, Veterans and Sweet
hearts at the Train.
Then a Big Chicken Dinner
Was Served to All.
A shrill whistle of a Union Pacific
train away down the tracks at 1:40
o'clock this afternoon released the
cheers and tears of joy which had been
smouldering in the hearts and lungs
of 700 Topekans. For two hours they
had stood in the chill November air
awaiting the return of 150 soldier boys
who -hadn't been too proud to light
Cheer after cheer cut thru the
sharp air, five Topeka bands burst
forth in as many ragtime numbers,
gray haired veterans who fifty years
ago had featured in a similar, altho
much sadder return, with half their
number dead, couldn't keep back the
tears. Mothers, wives and sweethearts
who had been supplied with automo
biles by Topeka organizations, pushed
thru the crowd and peered anxiously
down the tracks.
Not many months ago on a hot,
June morning a simile r whistle had
pierced the air of Topeka. It was the
Santa Fe whislle calling the members
of the Second Regiment band and
Battel y A to arms. Mothers, wives
and sweethearts heard that whistle
with feelings of fear and uncertainty.
Today, the Union Pacific whistle re
lieved all the fear and uncertainty
that ttiev had felt for months. The
members of the Second Regiment
band, Company B, Second regiment,
including Oskaloosa and Hoiton boys,
and the hospital corps stepped from
th train with not a scar, not a man
missing, stronger and healthier than
?ver befcre in their lives.
Wives anil Mothers First.
As the members of the Second reg
iment stepped from the train, the
mothers and wives were given first
place. Hugging and kissing was the
arder of th; duy with cheers ot the
delighted' hundreds calling Tor en
cores. The boys from Lawrence and
Oskaloosa and Hoiton were not for
gotten. Those who didn't have any
right to participate in the family re
unions, shook the hands of the others.
They, too. will go thru similar experi
ences before the day is over. The
Lawrence boys went on thru without
stopping.
r'. H. Roberts, editor of the Oska
loosa Independent, and father of
Frank Roberts, one of the members of
Company B, willingly agreed to the
entreaties of his wife and the two met
their boys at ihe station. At Oska
loosa tonight, the boys will be enter
tained with a banquet at which Col.
Wilder Metcalf and General Martin
will speak. Similar entertainment will
be given the boys from Lawrence and
Hoiton at their respective towns.
A bugle was heard. The hand
clasping and hugging and - kissing
reaped. Months of training on the
Mexican border was evidenced. They
"fell in ' instantly and in good order,
none of the awkwardness and chaos
of the June training at Fort Riley be
ing shown.
The Parade Starts.
Marshall's band struck up a lively
air, which was taken up by the Second
Regiment band, the Knights and La-
dies of Security band, Jackson s band
and the Santa Fe apprentice band. A
dozen Topeka organizations, some in
automobiles, others on foot, but all
with hanners flying and with voices
cheering fell into their respective
places assigned to them 1-y Col. L. M.
Penwell, marshal of the parade. Col
onel Penwell wore a uniform and rode
a big. white horse.
Marshall's Band Ahead.
Governor Caliper, Mayor House and
Col. A. W. Smith led the parade in an
automjbile, followed by
Marshall's '
band. Other organizations participat
ing in the parade up Kansas avenue

of the American Revolution; Daugh
ters of the American Revolution; De

and guests hurried to the tables and
participated in a smothered chicken
dinner which had been smothering
ever since 1 o"clock. The hall been

The fighting In this sector has been
continuous night and day. The offi

Paris, Nov. 13. The Serbians have
won a brilliant victory over the Ger

the Teutonic allies to rtire a distance
of nearly two miles and captured
about 1,000 prisoners.
The retreat of the German-Bulgarian
forces was compelled after a
battle lasting two days.
The prisoners raise the total cap

to the White House last night he was

he began reading a huge stack of mail
accumulated during his trip to Wil

political make-up of the house of rep
resentatives in the Sixty-fifth congress.
He was told Indications from present
returns were that the Republicans
would have 217 members and the
Democrats 212 with six members of
other parties.
The president was understood to he
more concerned over the make up of
the next house chiefly because of its
effect on the selection of speaker and
chairmanship of committee which he
is anxious to see in the hands of Dem
ocrats. As far as legislation is con
ppmpd it was said todav. Mr. Wilson
is confident that most measures to be
proposed by him would gain the sup
port of enough Republicans to carry
them thru. Mr. Wilson continued to
refuse to make any comment on the
election pending the receipt of formal
word from Mr. Hughes and the Re
publican national committee conced
ing his re-election.

Mayor House Says Commission
Would Consider.
A special election to vote bonds for
an artificial municipal gas plant In
Topeka became a possibility thta
morning at a meeting of the city com
missioners. R. E. McBride, a Topeka
man, appeared before the commis
sioners and asked their permission to
circulate petitions for the erection of
such a plant. '
"Seventy-two hours after the legal
entanglements are overcome we will
have 7,000 names on petitions asking
for an election," said Mr. McBride.
"What I fear Is that the injunction
bidding the city to keep its hands off
the gas controversy will interfere -with
the plan."
Can Circulate Petitions.
1 can see no reason why you
shouldn't go ahead with your peti
tions," said Mayor House. "So far as
I can see the only thing for the city
commission to do will be to inspect
the petitions and ascertain whether
they are legal and sufficient to call a
special election. I would wish first to
consult the city attorney, however."
' McBride spoke of the progress
made in the quality of manufactured
gas and told the commissioners that
one ton of ordinary Kansas coal would

also spoke of using trash and dead
animals picked up on the streets of
Topeka in making the gas and making
a consiaeraoie saving to Topeka.
