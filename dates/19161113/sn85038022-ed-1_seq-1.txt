The Republicans are not to be ex
cluded from the merry making. For
will they not also be participants in
dM hig parade? The committee ex
tends to all of them to take part and
as the Republicans quickly recovered
from the terrible blow of learning that
they will be compelled to bear Wood
row another four years a large crowd
of them will be in line.
A large number of Hrown countiiins
are expected to cross the river and
participate In the pubilee and the
Democrats all over the country are
shouting hallelujahs because Ohio went
Democratic. Free ferrioge on the
Steamer I -an ranee will be given to
men and women from everywhere !n

will be given an especial part in the
parade.
'Tis said that several notable char
acters, prominent In the history of the
country at the present will be present
and will add to the festivity of the oc
casion. Roosters galore will be on
hands to crow forth proclaiming that
Wobbly Woodrow has been reelected,
nit hough as Ed Morrow once observed,
they should hang their heads in shame
when they think of how their consorts,
the noble bens, arc treated under the
T'ndcrwood Tariff Law.
Ho to It, Democrats, we're for you.
Let ull of the Republicans in the
COMtry round show that they easily
