British and French Attacks Hit
Only Outskirts of Wonderful
Fortifications.
By CARL W. ACKERMAN.
United Press Staff Correspondent,
BOllmVIlBRE ON THE BOMME,
Nov. lo. (via Berlin and wireless to
Sayvllle, Nov. 13.) Germany is de
fending tho Homme with burled ar
tillery. In their assaults the French and
British are attacking only thi sur
face of the greatest fortifications In
the world. '
Germany built a surprise for tho
allies hero In a wondorful series of
artillery-proof fortifications. Theso
defenses are built so closo, are dug
so deep, and cover such a wide area
that what the allies aro today attack
ing with Infantry, tanks and artillery
are only the outskirts of a powerful
system of underground forts.
The bombardment Is terrific. Fields,
woods, and towns are torn to pieces
by constantly exploding shells. Hut
underground nothing Is touched. And
It Is from her subsurface forts that
Germany Is repelling the allied at
tack. Inspects Battlefield.
For a week I have been over the
Komme battlefield. From a height
near Peronne and to the south of
Arras, our party twice penetrated tho
shell area, viewing Peronne and
Bapaume, the two Immediate objects
of nre.
It marked tho first time since the
Somme battle began that a neutral
has boen permitted to Inspect this
part of tho underground fortifica
tions constructed by the Teutonic
forces. While waiting In tho library
of a castle serving as the headquar
ters of one of tho commanding gen
erals, the windows rattled and doors
shook from the concussion of burst
ing shells.
With these constant explosions In our
cars and escorted by intelligence of
ficers. w inotoied to thu hutghts of
Uapaume. Thero we watched the Brit
ish fire' In the town. Only ona church
spire and one chimney still Is standing.
Although In approaching tho front wo
encountered seventeen lines of trenches
nnd wire entanglements, the Somme
battle Is no longer being defended from
the trenches, but with burled artillery.
For miles as we walked we passed holes
In the ground largo enough for men to
crawl Into.
These were the entrances to thou
sands of underground forts which the
Germans have built up in an endless
chain.
Some Sixty Feet Deep.
The underground defenses vary In
depth from a few feet to as much us
sixty feet. No cannon yet Invented can
penetrate them. And this Is tho reason,
German officers explain, why the Eng
lish cannot destroy the defenses.
Not a house, a barn, or a whole tree
is standing ln Achlctlepetlt. Our auto
mobile was halted en routo by soldiers
cleaning the road of debris from tho
recent bombardment. After passing
through, this village was again shelled,
Tho bombardment was so terrific as to
bo Indescribable. Tho whistling of
shells was continuous, and tho unac
countnblo explosions shattered every
one's nerves.
Our automobile Increased Us speed.
and others whizzed by, one carrying the
remains of French aeroplanes.
Underground Battery Unscratched.
We stopped at a plowed field, walked
to a nolo In tho ground, and entered
an underground battery. Abovo ground.
In some spots, so many shells Ifid ex
ploded It was Impossible to count the
shell craters. But underground, not
a cannon was scratched. Officers and
artillerymen were living with many of
the comforts of home.
Further on we passed hundreds of
French civilians and soldiers paving one
of the chief lines. Laborers were work
ing on a new network of railways which
had been constructed back of tho Sommo
since the battle began.
Permanent construction of roads and
railways Is necessitated by the contin
uous rnlns which make the Somme ronda
and fields In many places Into running
rivers of mud. Automobiles are hardly
able to plow through, and soldiers from
tho first lino declare they wallow In mud
like pigs on a Hoosler farm.
Allied Method of Attack.
Tho allied method of attack on the
Sommo has been to use heavy artillery,
gas bombs, hand grenades, and tanks. In
one village tho English fired during,
one night 30,000 gas bombs, but the next
morning the German soldiers crawled
out like rabbits from their holes and
went to work again.
Unanimous opinion concerning the
tanks Is they are a costly failure. They
can travel only four miles an. hour, and
are easily overturned hi artillery. Some
Tommy prisoners declare, they "put the
fear of God Into the Germans." It Is
admitted their first use caused surprise,
although now there Is nothing to fear.
All the German soldiers have had an
opportunity to study small models back
of the front, and the artillery now knows
how to destroy the real tanks.

GERMAN WILSON BACK. BUSY

Spends First Day of Return
Wading Through Flood of
' Letters and Wires.
MERRY BREAKFAST PARTY
President in Best of Humor.
Several Visitors Putting Up
at White House.
President Wilson spent his first day
back In Washington wading through a
flood of congratulatory letters and tele
grams that submerged his desk to a
depth of three Inches.
Arising at his customary hour of 7
o'clock, he was at breakfast at 8 with
Mrs. Wilson, ,Mlss Margaret Wilson,
Miss Helen Wood row Bones, John W.
Wilson, his cousin, and Charles R. Crane
seated at the table with htm. It was a
merry breakfast party, the President be
ing In tho best of houmor.
After a leisurely repast of fruit, eggs,
and toast and coffee, the President went
at once to the library, where ho sum
moned "Charlie" Swem, his Indefatig
able stenographer, and the two at once
plunged Into the task of reading the
accumulated mall. Although deeply
moved by the overwhelming number of
congratulations before him, which came
from men and women In every walk of
life, tho President today only attempted
to answer those from clpse personal
friends.
Waiting For Hughes.
His attitude today was what It has
ueen ever since the election. Ho was
awaiting a message from Mr. Hughes
which would Indicate the tatter's will
ingness to concede his defeat. Pending
such a message, the President Is said
to feel that' It would not be fitting for
him formally to accopt the congratula
tions that have been showered upon
him.
The President was not permitted for
long to forget the grave foreign prob
lems that have been hanging over his
Administration for the past two years.
Shortly after 10 o'clock. Secretary
Lansing called up the Whlto Houso and
arranged for a conference later in the
day. It Is understood that the Presi
dent and tho Secretary of State will
go carefully over all the latest reports
concerning the renewal of German sub
marine activities and the situation in
Mexico.
If tho President worked In the se
clusion of his privato study for most
of the day, It did not Interfere with
the horde of Jubilant Democrats who
swarmed the Executive offices. All day
long the office of Secretary Tumulty
was crowded with men eager to show
their enthuslsem over tho result, and to
discuss tho whys and wherefores of the

laurels on him for the work ho had
done In tho campaign. National Com
mitteeman Crawford of Florida was
among the first on the scene at the
offices.
After luncheon the President and Mrs.
Wilson anticipated going for a long
automobile ride through tho Maryland
and Virginia hills, which the Presi

his sojourn In Washington.

brought about his arrest here Sat
urday, concerning "stock which
could be played on the American
market as sure winners."
COUNTESS' STOCK SOLD.
The only reference to stock In the
letter to Countess von Bernstorff." It
was declared at the embassy today,
"was an explanation of the sale of
twenty shares of stock held by the
countesi.
"There was nothing in two of 'the
letters Graves produced." a high' embas
sy official said, "that would not have
been permitted to pass the English cen
sor." The contents of the third letter wero
not divulged, but embassy officials dis
played no fear of It publication.
Officials of the State and Justlcs de
partments and the District Attorney's
office prepared today a preliminary
hearing of Graves before United States
Commissioner Anson Taylor Wednes
day morning.
Envoys Not To Appear.
The German embassy ofilclals said
they did not contemplate appearing to
prosecute Graves. They explained they
would have to get the consent of tho
German government before they could
appear In court proceedings in this coun
try. When attention was called to Graves"
den that German embassy officials
would refuse to appear because they did
not dare to let him give his transla
tions on the witness stand of the three
code letters. Prince Hatzfeldt, counselor
of the embassy, plainly was angered.
He sold he would ask his government
for permission to appear against Graves
If tho Department of Justice believes It
necessary.
Graves has threatened, if prosecution
Is pushed, to reveal the secret code In
the letters to Countess von Bernstorff.
Princo Hatzfcldt said the letters were
not In code. A. Bruce Btelaskl, Depart
ment of Justice Investigator, corrobo
rated this. The Department of Justice
has seized Graves' letters, and la re
turning them, Blelaskl said, but he in
sisted the letters oontalned no code.
Embassy Does Not Seek Letters.
Secretary of State Lansing today said
tho German embassy has made no re
quest for return of the letters' taken
from Graves by tho Department of Jus
tlco. German embassy officials apparent
ly were willing to await Wednesday'
preliminary hearing before making
any request for return of the letters.
What the embassy officials display
ed tnore Interest In was In discover
ing Just how Graves got possession
of these letters.
Federal prosecuting officials were
unable to Bay today whether they
havo enough evidence ao warrant
holding Graves for the grand Jury
without .testimony of Prince Iiatz
feldt, who sot the net In which Graves
was caught.
A representative of the Department
of Justice was secreted In Prince
Hatzfeldt's home when Graves at
tempted to sell the letters to the
embassy Saturday. The statement
made by Graves when given three
hours ''sweating" by Mr. Blelaskl
alio forms a part of the Government'
case.
Do Not Fear Escape.
Although Grave's bond Is but S,00n,
Justice officials entertain no fear
that he will attempt to escape. It t
understood Graves Is under uurvsll
lunce and will remain so until he
comes to Washington Wednesday for
his hearing.
Chief Blelaskl declared no disposi
tion has as yet been mado of the letters.
"I don't think they aro of any im
portance to anybody," he said. "The
case Is nothing but an ordinary one,
and we are treating It that way.1'
Department officials do not credit the
assortlons mndo by Graves that the let
ters hold secrets of high International
Importance.
"That's Just Graves talk, and I'm not
rcsponslblo for anything ho says," as
serted Chief Blelaskl when shown an
account of Graves' statement In New
York this morning.

Assistant United States Attorney
Leahy said the Government Is un
able to subnoena any diplomatic offi
cial, since they enjoy diplomatic Im
munity. They cannot be brought Into
court to aid the Government's prose
cution, as can tho private citizen,
Mr, Leahv had not examined the
evidence todav, and was unable to sav
whether the Government would be
able to make a prima facia case
atralnat Graves without the aid of
German embassy officials.
