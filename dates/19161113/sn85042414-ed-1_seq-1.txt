Cannot Hope to Get Party

TO HOLD OFF 65th
UNTIL DECEMBER 1917
Wilson Does Not Want to
Face Organization Fight
Until Forced To.
Washington) Nov. 13.—Members of
the house of representatives in the
newly elected Sixty-fifth congress face
one of the moBt uncertain organiza
tion situations in the history of the
government.
With a few districts still in doubt
the Republicans appear to have a
plurality of four or five members and
a possible majority of two or three
when it is figured that an Independent
elected in Massachusetts and a Pro
gressive elected in Minnesota prob
ably will vote with them for organi
zation purposes. Independence of ac
tion has characterized a number of
re-elected members on the Republican
side, however, and their attitude to
ward Democratic legislation In the
last few years has given Democratic
leaders cause for hope that some of
them might carry their independence
into the organization of the next
house.
Wilson May Not Call Session.
On the face of the unofficial returns
the political division of the house Is so
close that an effective and certain
working majority does not exist. In
view of the situation it is regarded
by Democratic leaders as improbable
that President Wilson will call an ex
tra session of the new congress next
spring. In that case the organization
fight will not come until the regular
session in December. 1917, which will
mean maneuvering for more than a
year In the contest for speakership of
the house and the organization of im
portant committees.
Fight for Speaker.
As matters stand today, tjie can
didate of the Republicans for speaker
will be James R. Mann, present mi
nority leader. Speaker Clark gener
ally is regarded as the Democratic
choice to succeed himself. Already,
however, there are rumblings of un
certainties because of the close politi
cal division. On the Republican side
there. are reports of disaffections
against the minority leaders and can
didate for speaker on the part of
metnbers who it is suggested, might
vote for Clark instead. Consequently
there is gossip among some Republi
cans regarding the advisability of
naming another man as candidate for
speaker, if one can be found upon
whom the Republican membership
could unite.
Democrats Face a Row.
Some interesting and lively party
conferences on both sides before any
organization tickets are finally
launched, is assured. As the Dem
ocrats apparently will be in the mi
nority some friends of Champ Clark
are not certain he will be a candidate
to succeed himself. Unless he can be
elected speaker they prefer .that he
abandon the race and become,a can
didate for minority leader, the post
he held for many years before the
Democratic ascendancy in 1912. Such
a development might precipitate a
lively contest within the Democratic
ranks with Claude Kitchin, the pres
ent majority leader, and Speaker
Clark as rival candidates for the
minority leadership.
The congressional result in New
Mexico is doubtful, the chances now
favoring the Democrats. In Pennsyl
vania there are two districts and pos-

Columbus, Ohio, Nov. 13.—Of 175

Berlin, Nov. 13, (wireless to Say

Washington, Nov. 18.—President
Wilson was 'bs.ck at his desk in the
White House today after an absence
of two months, prepared to take up
Important foreign problems, which
-have been held in abeyance pending
the election, as well as domestic ques
tions. These included the German
submarine sitlation, the Mexican
problem and a number of federal ap
pointments.
According to the administration of
ficials, the president has not even
considered the question of changes In
his .cabinet. They characterize as
premature reports that he has decided
on such changes. It is possible, how
ever, that one or two cabinet officers
may not remain after March 4.
The president asked first for the
latest information on the political
makeup of the house of representa
tives in the sixty-fifth congress. He
was told that, indications from present
returns were that the Republicans
would have 2171' members and the
Democrat* 212, with six members of
other parties.
Wilson continued to refuse to make
any comment on the election pending
the receitrt of 'formal word from
Hughes and the Republican National
committee conceedlng his re-eiection.
Henry Morgenthau, chairman of the
finance committee of the Democratic
national committee conferred with
Wilson today.
After a brief stay here the president
may go away for a rest before con
gress convenes.
It 1b considered possible that one or
more members of the cabinet may re
sign .for personal reasons- Secretary
McAdoo frequently is mentioned as
one likely to resign. It was stated
definitely today that McAdoo can re
main in the president's cabinet so long
as' he desires, and it was denied that
he offered his resignation.

Petrograd, Nov. 13.—It is officially

the bombardment in the Gulf of Fin

were of the 36-knot torpedo craft.
The Gulf of Finland is an arm of
the Baltic sea between Finland and

At the eastern end of the bay is

The entrance to the gulf is guarded

naval activity in the war with Russia
has been in the vicinity of the Gulf
of Riga, and on one occasion the Ger
mans effected a landing in the rear of
the Russian line. The fact that only
light German warships were employed
Friday, however, indicates that the
purpose of the German admiralty was
merely to make a quick, raid.

"The strike vote still is in effect,"
said W. G. Iee for the brotherhoods,

New York, Nov 13-»-Representatives

tion of a statute.
I The meeting is described by repre

of determining whether both sides
view the law in the same light.
Neither side understands the legis
lation or how it is to be applied, it is
stated, and an effort is being made to
reach some common ground for its
application, if the United States su
preme court decides the law is con
stitutional in suits brought by several
roads to determine this fact.
