FACTS
NE 1
ABOUT BUSHMAN-BAY
'ROMEO AND JULIET
assistant
costume
The stars are Francis X. Bush
man, as "Romeo," and Beverly Bay
ne, as "Juliet."
The cost of production was $250,
000 .
The first picture was taken May
25, 1916; the last, August 23, 1916
thirteen weeks to a day.
The cost of the costumes alone
amounted to $35,000.
John W. Noble was general direc
tor; associated with him were Ed
ward Eisner, assistant director
Rudolph De Cordova, Shakespear
ian adviser; Edward Powers, cast
ing and costume director; Leander
De Cordova, financial and
director; Harry Sothern,
and assistant director.
A scenario rn^de from William
Shakespeare's great drama, "Romeo
and Juliet," was submitted by John
Arthur and accepted; Rudolph De
Cordova modified and augmented
this, and John W. Noble made the
final changes.
All the leading characters of the
play really spoke Shakespeare's
lines while going through the ap
propriate action. Whenever a
player forgot a speech the camera
was stopped and was obliged to be
gin over again.
Several of the greatest theatrical
families of America and England
are represented in the cast, which
includes a Booth, a Sothern, a Man
tell, a Kemble and a Hall Caine.
Six hundred players were employ
ed in the production of "Romeo and
Juliet."
Eighteen buildings, reproducing
the old marketplace of mediaeval
Verona, were built for the produc
tion. A great storm destroyed these
just as pictures were about to be
taken and they had to be entirely re
built at a total of more than $25,
000.
This picture is coming to the Ev
angeline very soon.

SHEPHERD OF THE HILLS
A fair attendance witnessed the
production of the Shepherd of the
Hills at the Evangeline Sunday
night and those attended were well
entertained with the play. The Shep
herd of the Hills company is made
up of a well-balanced cast and some
splendid character acting is present
ed. The play is filled with tense
situations and the dramatization of
Harold Bell Wright's popular novel
of the same name has been cleverly
arranged.
The story of a great wrong and
a greater forgiveness is portrayed in
the Shepherd of the Hills. Many
strong dramatic episodes are dealt
with during the play and a whole
some vein of comedy scatters smiles
throughout the four acts. The last
scene of the last act brought tears to
many eyes which evidenced the able
acting of the company.
NEW THEATRE OPENS
Saturday witnessed the opening of
the New Theatre in Morgan City
under the management of Mr. Harry
Davis. The offering for the opening
was a seven-reel picturization of the
adventures of Sherlock Holmes and
was witnessed by a large attendance.
Suinday's production was a five-reel
comedy entitled the Mis-Leading
Lady. Both productions are Essanay
Film Features and speak well for the
judgment of Manager Davis in se
curing such splendid service for his
patrons.
Gloria's Romance," one of the
most noted films of the day, will
probably be the first serial film play
to be handled by the New Theatre.
•The date of the opening- installment
will be announced soon.
Prehistoric Reminiscence
When you and I were monkeys,
A million years ago,
We played upon the treetops,
On the coast of Borneo.
You chased me through the forest
Armed with a flinty rock;
You bumped my slanting forehead
Till of stars I saw a flock.
At eventide we'd cuddle
'Mid the dinsaurus's wails;
And just to change the subject
We'w hang down by our tails.
These were the happy hours
Of pre-Darwinian jape;
When you were but a monkey,
And I simple an ape.—Jhiladelph
ia Ledger.
The shortage of cars is still a
complexing question among the ship
pers in this section. Those who re
quire ten cars a day are securing one
or two and many fail to receive this
quota. This in a great measure is
causing the advancing prices in
everything, in general, according to
reports. Spaghetti is 50 to 75 cents
higher than ever before. Octagon
soap 35 cents a case higher. Milk
$1.25 a case higher. Eggs are reach
ing close to five cents each, and it is
predicted that Christmas eggs will be
selling at 60 cents per dozen. Chick
ens, are well up around 25c and _28c
per pound, and so on down the line.
We could quote advances for the full
length of a column. Shoes have ad
vanced $1.25 per pair since last
July. This is the better grade of
shoes, and the cheaper grades have
advanced in proportion. Cotton
goods have in many instances more
than doubled in prices. While car
shortage has a great measure of
this blame, yet it is not altogether a
matter of cars, nor is it a corner of
the market, it is merely a general
shortage of home supply and an in
creased export demand. So that to
day there are other things "going
up" besides the. elevator.
A swell and up-to-date gift is a
Gold Point Fountain Pen. Ask the
next Contestant to show you one.
You will have to subscribe for the
Review in order to buy one of these
beautiful pens and it is the best way
to help your favorite contestant to
win.
