Washington, .Nov. 12.- The Germnn
Kmbassy, after causing the arrest of
Dr. Armgaard K.irl One** here yes
teniay for lllegad blackmail of the
lounteas von Iii-niKtortT, will not ap?
pear to press th<* charge against him
at his hearing Wcdne.day. Ah a con
sequencc, Department of JiiHtice offi?
cials do not see ho'v he can be held, as
the only witnesses outside the emha--y
are government detectives.
"We could WalYfl diplomatie immunity
anil appear as witnesses,-' an embassy
oflicial aaid, "but we are interested only
in obtaining the letters, which are now
ll] the poiMMion of the Department of
Justice and will, we understand, be
turned over to us."
The Department of Justice has made
no arrangements to deliver the letters
to tbe embassy. It is probable that
they will be turned over to thc State
Department for uisposition.
Gravcs ll understood to have threat
ened sensational revelations concerning
the embassy's alleged irregularities if
embassy officials pressed the charge
against him.
Dr. Armgaard Karl Grave*, who was
arrested in Washington on Saturday,
charged with itttempting to blackmail
Countess von Rernstorff, wife of tha
German Ambassador, yeaterday said the
mysterious letters in the case related
to stock transactions in which the am?
bassador and others in the United
States and in Germany are interested.
The "international spy" permitted
the inference to be drawn from his
carefully gunrded remarks that the
ambassador has made a practice of
utili.ing confidential diplomatie infor?
mation to further the interests of a
recret syndicate which has dealt co
vertly, but profitably, in. Ameriean
stocks which have been affected by the
war.
The letters, which Dr. Grave* aaserts
are now in the hands of United States
agents, appear to be personal commu
nications ai a rather intlmate nature
from a German noblewoman to Coun?
tess von HernstorfT, an.l nothing more.
However, asserts Dr. Graves, they con
tain a most ingenious cipher, which,
when translated, reveala the alleged
secret stock trading operations of the
ambassador and his colleagues.
Willing to Give V. S. Key
Dr. Graves says he is willing to re?
move all doubt from hia assertion by
decoding the letters for thp benefit of
the United States Department of Jus?
tice.
"I am giving out this information,"
he said, "because I want every one to
know that the report there was any?
thing in these letters compromising to
ta. character of Cotinte** von Rern
Itarfl is untrue. The letters are of an
rther nature entirely. and before thi*
affair is over the German Fmbns'y will
rerkon it aa a luckless dav when l was
arrested and this became public. I see
the imbai-j reports I may not be pros
ecuted. Good! I shall never even be
indicted."
Dr. Graves, whose activity aa a mo?
tion picture scenario writer and lect
urer may have deceived some. a* to his
?lat ker enterprises as a *py, arrived in
N'ew York early yesterday and went
i.re.-Cy to his apartments, at 65 West
Sixty-ei.hth Street. where he Was ?e.-*n
bv a Tribune reporter.
Graves will not tell how he came in
?ion of Um countess'. mail. II.
deniei h? atole tn. !ctters. aa the
eharg. against him a'.ii-ges, but wiil
not adinit collusioti witn the couricra
who smugg'ad the rnissive* past the
Rntisii censor. As for the blackmail
charge, Dr. Graves said he asked Princa
Hat7t'eldt, councilior of the German
Kmha?sy, for f_,00n merely as payment
for tht- nessrnger* who brought the
missives from Germany.
Says He Asked No Monev
"1 a'ked for no money for myself."
?aid Dr. Gra*/M, "only a written state?
ment from ihe German Kmbassy to thi
eff-Cl that I, Armgaard Karl Grave,. ,r\
such and such a day had performed a
great service for the embassy. Such a
testimonial I could use to advantage."
"Why." the doctor was asked, "wasn't
Prince Hatzfeldt smart enough to sup-!
press the letters if he knew you had
ktiowledge of their alleged damaging
contert* ?"
"Hat.feldt thought I was blufTing
about deciphering the code. You see,
there are three letters in all. They ap?
pear to be ordinary eommunicationa
aurh ns would pass between women.
One of the letters contains no code
that 1 eovld discover. That is the one !
I took l* Prince Hat.feldt. I told him :
what I knew of the other 1-tters, and
he thought I was blufnng. They
thought they had a good chance of>
ihnttinf me up once and Lor all, and'
*o I was arrested on these preposteroua
charges. I have been more or less of!
n thorn in the aide of the German !
Kmbaisy for quite a while."

Zapatistas Massacre 100

Trmn __a TtU* I M'ir?au 1
Wasliine-ton, Nov. 12.?Tho Mexican
situation is again thr?-atening. Gen?
eral Carranza has rei'erated his de?
mand for the withdrawal of the Ameri
ean troops now in Mexico. The new de
r.iand is now on the way to Carranza'*
commissioners at the Atlantic (.'ity con?
ference. I'nless it il hceded. according
to roliabi. information obtained by The
'Iribune to-day. the Mexican commis?
sioners will be instructed to withdraw
immediately.
The situation wai further compli
cated to-day by reports received at the
State Department of tho outbreak of
serious disturbonces in Mexico. The
Caimnia latboritlfM are reported ar
resting Ameriean citizens, whom they
charge with being secret agents of the
Ameriean army; Vilia bandits are loot
mg right and left and are said to be
marching now _~_i;.-;t the expedition
nry forces; and Zapatistas have con?
tinued their outrages. massnering
scores of men, women and children.
Ofticials hold that the arrcst of Amer?
icans proves the insineerity of the Kirst
proves the insincerity of the Kirst
Chlofl pledges, and tnat the continued
dapradatioM of VUla and Zapata
bandits show that the de facto govern?
ment by no mean? has the situation in
hund. but stili needs Ihe presence of
tln* Ameriean tluane.
Waited for Klection
Carranza ba.es h'.s new demand for
the withdrawal of the expeditionary
forces on the warning given to the
State Department whel the commission
first mot, that no delay would be toler
nted after the President ial election.
Bfl agreed, it ia declar.-il, to the com?
mission plan, on the understanding that
it was the only practicnble way to post
pone action on the withdrawal of the
Ameriean forces during the Presiden
tial campaign. The purpose of the corn-,
million, according to this information,
was to prevent rather than to further
? Mttltmtnt Of the Mexican question.
lt i? admitted m high official quar-;
ters that the commission, after two
months of MIliOM, has iiccompli-died
literally nothing toward an igraontont
with Carranza. The Mexican commis?
sioners, as a body, have rcfuscd stead-1
fiistly tO discuss Mexico's internal af?
fairs', and the Americans have declined
to talk about thc internationnl situa-i
tion created by the presence of Ameri?
ean troops in Mexico.
Stands on His Rights
General Carranza still stands on his
original contention that the I'nited
States il infringing on Mexican sov-,
ereignty, and that this situation can?
not be tolerated in a state of peace.
Hfl demands, therefore, that thel'nited
States grant full recognition of Mexi-;
can sovereignty Of cea<" pn-tensions
of friendship for his government.
State Department officials wiU not
discuss this government'* probable ac?
tion. Because of the election, it is
understod, no decision has been
reached. It is expected that Pre.ident
Wilson and Secretary Lansing will con
fer about it to-mcrrow

Columbian Captured
by U-Boat, Then Sunk
_
Survivors, Landed Safely in Spain, Tell How
Captor Tried for Two Days to Make Them
Quit Ship During Tempest
Pnris. Nov. 12. The t'rst details afl
the sinking of the American itaaiflhlp
"'olumbinn. of the American-Hawaiian
Line, off Cape Ortegal, Spain, on No?
vember 8, were received here to-day in
a wireless dispatch from Madrid.
The Columbian wai sunk by a Or
man submarine, according to this in?
formation. The steamer encoantered
the U-boat during a violent itorm on
November 0, two days before she was
torpedoed. The Columbian 4vas com
pelled by the submemible to stop. The
crew wns then ordered to disembark.
The tempest at this time 4vai so severe,
how, ver, that this was found to be lm
pos*ible.
The submnrine then compelled the
Columbian to lie under surveillnnce for
two days, until the storm subsided
Members of the Columbian'* crew who
were Innded at Corunna, Spain, tell tha
most graphic gtories of their wait un?
der the eyes of the submarire during
the forty-eight hours when the gale
was at its height.
Feared Sudden Attaek
F.xpecting. to be sent to the bottom
nny moment, they waited through the
long hours without sleep. The suhma
rino had warned them that nny attempt
to escape would bring Instant attaek.
No such effort was thought of, but tho
men were kept in a state of constnnt
nervous tension, believing that the sub- '
marine might become tired of waiting !
and launch a torpedo into the ship's >
hull.
Day and night they kept watch, but |
rarely was the captor seen. The mer*.
BELGIAN TOWNS
RAIDED FOR MEN
Deportations from Brus
sels to Begin This Week,
Rotterdam Hears
London, Nov. 12. Dispatches from
Rotterdam to-day say that tho deporta?
tions of Belgians continue daily on a
lnrgo scale. Antwerp and C.hent, the
dispatches say, are being slowly de
nuded of able-bodied males. Sixteen
thousand have already left Ghent. The ?
stories resemble somewhat those of th"
driving of the Freneh from Arcady by
thfl British.
Tho men deported from Ghent have '
been almost exclusively of the unem- *
ployed class, but elsewhere, the dls- i
patches say, and especially in Antwerp,
there has been less disenmination, and
many workers have been taken. No
men a* yet havo been taken from Brus
bels, but it is said that deportations
there will begin the luth.
According to stones current in Hol?
land, say the dispatches, in the "raid?
ed'' towns many men were pounced
upon suddenly and escorted away bv
anaad guards and not permitted to '
communicate with friends. Attempts
to escape the learchers are futile. Hnr
borers of men who are to be deported
nre severely punished. Hunger forces
hidden persons to surrender.
Wire harriers and machine guns are
placed around the stations where men
are to be entrained lest the crowds
threatcn to make trouble.

All this time, until the s'orm abated
and the submarine appeared on the sur- .
face two days after fhe steamer was
first halted. not a single call for help

le**. It was not until November 8. in
the afternoon, that the British Admir?
alty picked up S 0 S calls, saying that
tho Columbian was being shelled by a
submarine.
? ? Ship's Slle-nce a Mystery
This point has not yet been cleared
up, and is puzzling shipping circlcs
here more than any phase of the re?
markable adventure. It is assumed
thut the submarine warned the Colum?
bian that any effort to bring help
would speedily result in the sinking of
the ship.
How the l'-boat kept her captive un?
der strict survei'lance during those
two days is a mystery here. After the
storm had subsided the submarine ap?
peared and order.-d the crew to take
to the boats, according to the adviees
t'rom Madrid. It was then, it is be?
lieved, that the wireless S O S was
sent out from the Columbian, possibly
bocaU-0 the submarine threat of sink?
ing no longer had a restraining effect.
\ -."n as the men abandoned the ves?
sel the submarine sank her. She sank
almost Immediately. It is stated. The
men were picked up later and landed
safely at Corunna.
The Columbian case is unprecedent
ed in one respect: It is the flrst time
a submarine has ever held a vessel
captive at sea for two days before
torpedoing her. No other case is on

Boston, Nov. 12. Mrs. Adolph Apel,
of Ventnor Heights, N. J., an Ameriean
woman, in-Kurope the Countess Anna
L'rsula Dagenfcld, niece of Count Zep

cure for infantile paralysis and that
when the war was over German scien
tiitl would share their infallible rem?
edy with the world.
"Did you know," the countess asked,
"that a frightful epidemic of infantile
paralysis had swept over Germany
.since the beginning of the war? Thou?
sands of bablM died. Older people sue
cumbed, too, just ns they have in
America. "But German scientists found
a cure for infantile paralysis, posit
.ively. I have this on the highest au?
thority. The epidemic has been
checked. Perhaps when the war ia
over, or the merchant submarine com?
merce more tirrnly established, America
will get this cure."
"Suppose the Allies get the Peutsch?
land this time?" she was aswed.
"It cannot be," she answered em
phatically, "there are enough subma?

TEUTONS LOSE
ON 4 FRONTS
IN BALKANS
Falkenhayn Menaced
in the Northeast by
Russian Drive
ENTENTE ARMIES
SEIZE HEIGHTS
Mackensen Forced Back;
Serbs Rout Bulgars;
Rumanians Win
London. Nov. 12.?The Ruma?
nians, assisted by th*? Russians, hava
resumed the offensive against Falk?
enhayn along the whole eastern
Transylvanian frontier. Subatan
lial successea wero obtained against
the Teutonic forces to-day. On tha
northern Rumanian border the Aua
tro-Germans are continuing their
advance at some pointa. but hava
been checked at othera.
Meanwhile, in the Dobrudja tha
Entente forces are sweeping aouth
ward toward the Cernavoda-Con
stanza line steadily, breaking up tha
Teuton resiatanee with ur.expected
power. On the Macedonian front
the Serba have developed their auc
cesses in the region south of Mon
astir and again threaten the en
velopment of that position.
Falkenhayn haa a new and menaclng
enemy to face ln the northeastern ?ec
tor of the Transylvanian front.
Hltherto the Russian activities hava
been confined almost exclusively to thflt
region near Dornavatra. in Bukowina.
The operations of the Czar's troopa on
the Western Moldavion frontier had
consisted largely of defensive movea.
Kuaslana Presslng Hard
N'ow, however, the Russians ara
presslng the battle with irresistibla
vigor in the district far south of Dor?
navatra. More than fifty mile* flouth
of tha Bukowina border they hava
taken things into their own hands. and
for several days have bean admlnlatflt
irg ?harp defeats to the Germanlfl
forces.
To-day. after beating back tha
enemy'fl attacks in the Tulghe* leetor.
the Russians swept forward south of
Almaeneic and at the point of tho
bayonet carried two commanding
heights.
Their whole recent campaign in this
district has been worked out earefully
and skilfully, with an eye not only
U.wrtrd relieving at once the pressure
or. the Rumanian linas to the south, but
also toward accomplishlng ?ome perma?
nent suceess. Consequently, along tha
front on which they now face the in?
vaders in Transylvania the Russianfl
are solldly Intrenched in potittom
from which they can develop thair
plans with the maximum results and
the minimum effort.
A fairly declsive vietory in this quar?
ter would have an immediflte effect on
the situation along the entire front.
That Falkenhayn has only ju?t raaliied
the new menace is Indicated by thfl
hurried transfer of reinforrementfl ta
this sector in the last few dayi.
Kumaniana Win Heights
King Ferdinand's troops Kept paca
with the Rusilana during the day along
the rest of tha We?tern Rumanian
front. In tha Troitus Valley they
?wung forward in great maflses and
seued Mount Alumis and Mount Prec
tesele, dominating heights, that will
strengthen any future movemanta
against the Teutona.
South of this ragion, near Oitui, twa
more important heights tha summita
of Lupcei and Fatamoarta?fell inta
their hands. Tho lightlng here waa af
fhe most desperata nature. Sixtean at?
tacks, eight by each side. are recorded
in the official communicatiom from
Berlin and Bucharest. Berlin itataa
that the Rumanians i..*t more than ona
thousand prisoners ,n tha encounter,
and claim* the partial flucceis of Falk?

Partly offfletting theae Rumanian
succeises, tha Gormanic troon* won

Berlin.
