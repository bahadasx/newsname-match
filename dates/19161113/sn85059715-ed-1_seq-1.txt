The Fairmont Times the ma- *
chins nrBnn of t.hft Dftmncmtln ho?s?>n ^
lets out a vigorous complaint against
a proposed special session of the legislature
of West Virginia to pass
what it terms "a civil service law." '
Our experience with. Democratic poll- ]
ticlans leads us to believe that a civil
service law has no terror for the Dem_ '
ocratic bosses. It is only when out of
power that Democrats favor civil ser- .
vice. The civil service laws of the
national government, carefully built m
up under four Republican administrations,
and at the demand of the best
thought and most decent sentiment
of the United States, were ruthlessly
thrust aside by President Wilson,
so that within one year after the Democrats
got possession of the national
government, civil service became a
standing joke. This legislation was
overridden, the laws violated and
swept aside, in order to find places for
what William J. Bryan termed, "deserving
Democrats."
The people of West Virginia are not
I _ o _# _ I.J 1.1. t _ i t .111. .
in iavo5 01 maiting me state institutions
the prey of the Democratic boss- 1
es of this state. The Republicans
when In power could be trusted to
keep politics out of these institutions,
and have uniformly done so. We need
clt but one Instance, and that Is, that
during fifteen years of Republican ad- a
ministrations in the state, they have s
kept in power presidents of the state a
university who were rapid Democrats a
for ninety per cent of that time, and
more than half of the principals of o
the state normal schools during that t
period have been Democrats. ThlB 5
policy^ would be changed if the Democratic
bosses are given a free hand, I
and the interests of the state will be J
sacrificed in every direction to make
room for Democratic ward-healers. t
Will Deserve Well.
1
While we cannot speak for Gov- 8
ernor Hatfield, if he succeeds In hav- c
ing passed a reasonable law which
?>1 1 1 - H 4" A A *Vv * M A it* Vt M A MAW
win yiocut uic auuov ui paiiuuage
and the conversion of the state n
Institutions into Democratic political c
headquarters, he will deserve well of
the people of West Virginia. ^
The claim that civil service, or o
any other kind of law, will prevent v
the abolition of useless offices is too g
ridiculous to fool anybody. The
manner of an appointment to an of- h
flee in" no way prevents the Demo- E
crats from abolishing it. If that a
party can find one useless office in 1
West Virginia, and one which it i:
dares to abolish, the way will remain. [
wide open, regardless of the appoint- t
Ing power. We believe that Presl- t
dent Wilson went into office In pursuance
of a Democratic cry of economy,
and under promises to! abolish
useless .omces. ret, ouring rreaident
Wilson's administration, more
than 36,000 ' new offices have j
been created, carrying- with
them a salary roll of over forty mil-,
lion, dollars; and the end is not yet:
The Democratic program includes .
hundreds of useless commissions - of .
the same character as thousands already
created by that party. When
no other excuse could be found for j
useless commissions. President Wll- c
son- appointed a t commission at "a ,
high salary to meet and confer with 3
Mexican bandits, to see if he could t
[Settle by a commission and by talk <
the question of the slaughter of t
American citizens in Mexico, the par- s
ticular subject of the last conference 3
being the slaughter of about fifty t
members of a regiment of infantry <
that had been sent on a hike into ]
Mexico to arrest a bandit. <
The most pressing question that 1
can come before a special session of 1
the legislature of West Virginia
vwould be a thorough investigation
of the election frauds in Marion
county. Word comes from that county
on too good authority to be doubted
that the Democratic politicians 1
openlv defied eyery election law,:. 1
bodily took possession of the polls,' 1
remained in the -voting places, and 1
dictated how the yoters whom they 1
bosses control should.: cast their - ballots.
In one -voting place in particular
where they were,, voting a large
drove of. negroes , recently im
ported from Alabama,* a* Repub- ;
llcan went into the voting 1
place to protest against the out-; '
| rageous violations of the law, which :
was openly permitted by. the Demo-; '
craltc election commissioners, and to '
'ask'that a- Democratic politician who {
was' standing by, and directing no- .
groes how to vote, should be com^ 1
pelled to retire from the : voting ,
placeibeybnd the sixty foot limit, and ^
this Republican was thrown bodily, \
out of the building. j
No -reasonable man', doubts., that <
hundreds;?* illegal votes were.cast'in 1
'Marion coufaty: in fact, the" Democratic 1
politicians'' have not even had the
denoy to attempt to excuse * their <
outrageous Violations of the .laws, but, 1
on the, other}. Hand, have boasted of 1
^* . ' ;
Droves of Illegal Voters.

About Former Progressives Not
Supporting Hughes and Entire
Republican Ticket.
JARVISVILE. Nov. 13*.?Union
district voters resent the statement
in Rossi M. Fisher's auto-obituary, in
Saturday's Telegram that "Progressives
voted the Democratic ticket nnd
have therefore found a new political
home, and there we hope thoy .will
be allowed to rest in peace." Former
Progressives in Harrison county supported
Mr. Hughes and the entire
Republican ticket as loyally as; Mr.
Fisher does, and they did so as a
matter or principle, too, rather than
Trom hope of a seat in the legislature.
Indeed, many voters here are wondering
when FiBher became the
priest of Republicanism to Invoice a
peaceful rest for the Progressives'
with whom none other than the
"sage and law-maker of Wllsonburg"
was hobnobbing some two short
years ago as a candidate for most
any old thing.
