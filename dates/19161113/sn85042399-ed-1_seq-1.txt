TIDINGS
Scattered Few
Still Have Hopes
With the exception of a scattered
few, the voters of Ashland have real
ized the re-election of President Wil
son. That Mr. Wilson was again a
winner became evident Friday morn
ing when positive information came
from California that that state had
gone for Wilson. Following the lead
of Chairman Wilcox of the national
committee, a few local republicans
Btlll are postponing paying bets or
committing suicide until after the of
ficial returns are all In, which will
probably be in a week or two.
The election was one of thrills and
surprises, The Btates which were
counted upon for Hughes went for
"Wilson, and vice versa. The west,
with the exception of Oregon, went
for Wilson. California finally held
the result in her hand and gave the
president a victory. Treatment of
Governor Johnson, a progressive, by
the conservative standpatters on the
Hughes management committpe Is
given as the cause, and seems feasi
ble in view of the fact that Governor
Johnson wan elected to the senate by
an overwhelming majority, which
leaves no doubts as to the regard in
which he is held in California.
The electoral votes now stand as

Tom" Hammond Is
Promoted to Major
Lieutenant T. W. Hammond, a
graduate of the Ashland high school
and later of West Point, and a broth
er of Mrs. J. H. Turner of this city,
has been promoted to one of the
choice majorshlps in the service of
TJncle Sam. Last July Lieutenant
Hammond was promoted to a cap
talncy and in September he was
again raised to major of the Philip
pine scouts, regarded as one of the
finest details In the Islands. General
Leggett' recommended Mr. Hammond
for the promotion. Such high rank
In bo few years in the army bespeaks
a great deal for the former Ashland
hoy. Major Hammond's detail will
extend over the next three years.

Thursday Night's
Council Meeting
Little of major importance oc
curred at council meeting last Thurs
day evening beyond the passage of
resolutions calling for the special
election to be held November 24. The
meeting v. as the first of this month,
last Tuesday being election night and
the meeting being postponed until
Thursday.
Councilman Root was absent when
Councilman Ashcraft called the meet
ing to order, presiding in place of
Mayor Johnson, who arrived later.
The routine reports, minutes, month
ly bills, etc., occupied an hour.
Patrolman WImer asked for and
received the balance, of his vacation.
On the petition of a number of res
idents in the neighborhood of Rock
street, a street light on Maple will
be moved to the corner of Rock in
order to provide light over both thor
oughfares. The committee which has charge
of the matter of the widening of Park
avenue reported having negotiation
deals under way with Messrs. Greer,
Leo,nard and Smith and Mrs. Satter
fleld for the land necessary, andt sat
isfactory progress.
In regard to the matter of drain
age at the rear of the Hotel Austin,
which hns been flooding across
Pioneer avenue, a tile drain and
drain under the sidewalk was or
dered. H. Hash asked the rental of the
septic tank property for grazing pur
poses for another year, the matter
being referred to the real estate com
mittee. The council relinquished all right
and title to a strip of land between
the Ferguson property and First
street, thus closing up a real estate
deal which has been long pending.
A resolution was passed authoriz
ing the recorder to accept payment
in full from G. W. Holly for the sew
er in front of his place on Granite
street, Mr. Holly wishing to clear up
the matter all at once.
A resolution calling a special elec
tion for November 24 for the pur
pose of voting upon the new park
control system and upon an amend
ment allowing the reassessing of
property was passed.
A meeting was called for Tuesday,
November 14, in order to care for
matters which will come up before
the next regular meeting.
Siskiyou Wet
Is False Rumor
Apparently originating from the
fact that certain districts in northern
California gave the California "dry"
amendments a favorable vote, a ru
mor is prevalent in Ashland that Sis
kiyou county has gone dry. As a
matter of fact the county option was
not on the ticket at the recent elec
tion, and since both the dry amend
ments were defeated in California
the status In Siskiyou county remains
the same and the travel of thirsty
ones will continue undiminished un
til snow makes the Siskiyou moun
tains impassable. The Weed district
also voted down a local option propo
sition which would have closed the
Weed and Shastina saloons.
C. E. Dana has moved Into the
Camps building recently vacated by
Mr. and Mrs. F. L. Camps and will
also have his musical studio there.

Charter Amendment Election
On Ifew Park Board Nov. 24th
A special clectilon has been called
to be held In Ashland on Friday, No
vember 24, for the purpose of sub
mitting to the voters of Ashland two
charter amendments for their ap
proval or rejection. The proposed
amendments, resolutions, list of elec
tion judges and polling places appear
elsewhere in this Issue.
Ite-assessmcnt.
One of the amendments proposed,
if carried, will admit of the city
council reassessing property in case
any kind of flaw Is found the original
assessment or method of assessing.
This provision is not revolutionary
in any way and will probably not
meet with any opposition. It merely
provides c legal way for doing away
with a lot of expensive court pro
cedure which would be necessary
should anyone ever successfully con
test an assessment of any kind be
cause of a flaw in the wording or
method of serving. Practically every
city has cuch a provision and, accord
ing to City Attorney Moore, it Is a
necessity.
Park iinil Mineral Water Control.
The otler amendment comes as a
result of months of investigation and
labor, and Is the work of the Com
mercial Club and city council work
ing jointly, it is an act to abolish
both mineral springs commission and
the park board, substituting in place
of these two one body, to be known
as the mineral springs and park com-
mission, and providing means of ' for publicity purposes, which in
financing the care and upkeep of the eludes the $300 yearly paid tho
parks and mineral system.
Some time ago It became apparent
to practically every thinking Ash
lander that under the present system
of having to bodies whose work
lapped over into each other's terri
tory, causing much friction and lack
of efficiency, Ashland could not gain
all that it should from its parks and
mineral water plant. Hence the
Commercial Club hoard of trustees
of twelve members sought to draw up
a charter amendment which would
result in the centralization .in. one
body of control of the parks, min
eral water system and all that per
tains to them. The club trustees
finally submitted an amendment to
the council which did not quite meet
the ideas of that body, and as a re
sult of a harmonious discussion the"
Land Grant Opening
May Be Delayed
It seems probable from the setting
of the time when the supreme court
will review the O. & C. land grant
case that the opening of any portion
of the lands will be delayed till after
next February. Should the court by
any chance take such action that the
final determination of the grant case
should be held up, it would be labor
lost to proceed now with the opening
of the tracts. There is also a grow
ing sentiment in favor of delaying
the opening till more settled weath
er, when it would be easier for
prospective homesteaders to examine
the lands and learn their value. Al
ready locating companies are being
organized to exploit the lands to vis
itors with the land hunger, and some
most alluring word pictures are be
ing painted of the tracts to be open
ed. Eveiy possible warning should
be given the public, however, and
the intending settler should know
that the people with whom he deals
are in a position to give service. A
proportion of the lands will not be
worth the filing fee, and sometimes
unscrupulous locators have taken a
man's money for showing him one
claim and locating him upon anoth
er. The probability is also strong
that there will be very many appli
cants for the really valuable tracts,
and no locator can offer any assur
ance that the applicant will have any
advantage over every other appli
cant. There is no place to gain an
advantage.
Pendleton Normal
Amendment Loses
The Pendleton normal schdol
amendment lost out by a few thou
sand votes in the recent election.
Single Item veto carried, as did also
rural credits, ship tax exemption, le
gro suffrage, prohibition, the Sunday
law repeal, and tax limitation. The
brewers' amendment and single tax
measures lost. " ' '
eouncil decided to join with the club
board and city attorney in drawing
up a proposition which would be sat
isfactory to all. As finally drawn
up by Attorney Aloore, the amend
ment met tho approval of both the
board of trustees and council, and at
Thursday night's council meeting
proper resolutions were passed sub
mitting it to the vote of tho people.
Stated briefly, the proposed amend
ment provides for a board of three
members, to bo elected nt the regular
city election In December, one of
whom sei ves one year, one two years
and one three years, u new member
being elected each year after this one
to Bene throe years. The board will
have control of tho parks and min
eral water system, and the springs
water commission and park board
will go nut of existence, handing over
tho property In their care to the new
board. The members of the board
are to serve without pay and be
properly bonded. All of the usual
restrictions applied to city officials
are Included.
Finance.
The section which will receive the
most careful attention from tho tax
payers of Ashland is that providing
for funds for the work of the new
board. In the past there have been
three separate tax levies made: one
of two mills for the park board, one
of one mill for the springs commis
sion work, and one of one-half mill
Chautauqua Association (this same
amount is provided for in the new
amendment). Thus a total of three
and one-half mills has been levied In
the past. The new amendment pro
vides that the council shall levy
thre and one-half mills for the
parks, mineral water system and pub-
llcity work and does away with the
former levies, the total going Into the
hands of the new board. Additional
provision Is made that the council
may, f it deems necessary, levy up
to fl'- mills. In the past there has
been no reason why, If it had been
necessary, the council should not
have levied this amount or more, so
as far as finances are concerned the
new amendment will not cause any
heavier financial burden to fall upon
the taxpayers.
To Build Short Cut
) Into Town of Hilt
Thirteen landowners from near the
town of Hilt waited on the Siskiyou
county board of supervisors Monday
and requested them to build a road
way from the town 'of Hilt to con
nect with the state highway on the
northern Bide of Bailey hill. It was
opposed by the Fruitgrowers' Supply
Company, which have large timber
interests in that section of Siskiyou
county and also own the property in
which the town of Hilt is situated.
The board of supervisors, finding
that the Southern Pacific Company
are willing to grant a right-of-way
over their property, acceded to the
request of the land owners. The
road when completed will be a little
over a mile long. It is now neces
sary for persons traveling by auto
or team to go a distance of four or
five miles to reach the highway
whether they want to go north or
south. Attorney B. K. Collier repre
sented the applicants and Attorney
R. S. Taylor was for the Fruitgrow
ers' Supply Company.
The Fruitgrowers' Supply Cora
pany opposed the road on the
grounds that it would attract a num
ber of undesirable people and dis
rupt the control of the company over
their employes.
The real truth of the matter is
that with the completion of the Bail
ey hill tunnel it has become easier
for the thirsty Oregonians to find
restoratives in Hornbrook than to
take the rough, long road to Hilt.
The Hilt saloonmen want the road.
The Hilt lumber company does not.

Many Are Guests
Of Grants Pass
About sixty from Ashland went to
Grants Ptss Saturday on the beet day
special train, the train being crowded
,with four hundred farmers and busi
ness men before reaching the beet
city. A pleasant and profitable day
was enjoyed, the party being taken
through the $1,000,000 factory and
seeing tho process of sugar making.
The fares of the farmers were paid
by the Grants Puss citizens and a big
dinner at noon was also free. A
program was held In the afternoon
and officials of the sugar company
told of the industry.
The interesting portion of the pro
gram was that Indulged in by the
beet growers and farmers themselves.
John Mills, tho banner sugar beet
grower of southern Oregon, was first.
He had kept close tab upon the cost
of producing beets and showed that
after every item had been deducted,
with interest on Investment, taxes,
etc., he had a net profit of $79.22
per acre.
His gross return of $154 per acre
was verified by the sugar company.
Mr. Mills planted his beets March 22
and irrigated them three times. He
said that this year he would plant
every acre that he had available, and
would plant a thousand acres if he
had them.
Other farmers spoke In like strain,
and ther? is an assurance that the
acreage to be planted to beets next
season will bo greatly Increased.
The train returned early in the
evening.
More Irrigation
In Northern Calif.
Yreka News: H. J. Sarter has a
crew of men engaged In surveying
the Webb tract, comprising 2000
acres adjoining Montague, for the
purpose of determining the number
of acres that can be covered by wat
er from their pumping plant on the
Shasta river.
The Webb brothers recently made
application to the state water com
mission for permission to appropri
ate 12 cubic feet per second of the
waters of Shasta river for the pur
pose of irrigating this land. It Is
proposed to rnlse the water to one of
the small hills near the river and
then siphon it across town to a point
on Gregory hutte, from where it will
be distributed over the remainder of
the tract. The estimated cost of the
new system will be $20,000. '
The reclaiming of this land will be
of much benefit to the community, as
it will place in cultivation a large
tract of land that has lain useless
In the past.
Oregon Teams

The University of Oregon defeated
Pullman 12 to 3 at Portland Satur

Next Few Weeks
Will Be Wet Ones
Oregon has gone absolutely bona
dry dryer than a salted herring
swimming In a cloud of cracker dust.
But it is a question of many sides
as to just how and when und to what
extent the law Is going into effect
and what will happen when it does
go into effect. The bone dry amend
ment passed by a majority which will
be somewhere around 4,000 votes.
The amendment forbids tho importa
tion of liquor and specifically nulli
fies the present law, which allows
the importation of two quarts of
liquor or twenty-four quarts of beer
in each twenty-eight days. And that
Is as far as it goes. No penulty is
1 provided and no means tor enforce
ment specified.
According to the state constitu
tion, amendments voted by the peo
ple go Into effect Immediately after
the votes have been canvassed by
the secretary of state and tho result
proclaimed by the governor. The
problem revolves around whether or
not the governor is forced to pro
claim the law immediately after tho
official count Is completed, which
tills year would be about December
1. If ho is, it will either bo neces
sary to call a special meeting of tho
legislature to provide a penalty for
the violation of the new dry law, or
else between December 1 and the
first of January the old law will ha
dead, und while It will be illegal to
Import booze, there will be no pen
ulty to stop citizens from Importing
any quantity they wish, if he is not
obliged to issue his proclamation im
mediately, he will probably refrain
from doing so until the legislature
has met and fixed a penalty and the
old law will remain in effect until
that time. The next three weeks
will slip by under the old law, at
any rate, and November liquor im
portation will take a big jump.
It is understood that the prohibi
tion forces are contemplating asking
the legislature to pass a law prohibit
ing possession of liquor in order to ,
raako the importation clause effect
ive.
Until instructions arrive to the
contrary, the local express office is
handling shipments as usual.
Ashland gave the dry law a great
big majority and defeated the brew
ers' amendment by a three to one
vote, unmistakably mr.king plain the
attitude which the big majority of
Ashland residents have toward
liquor.
The liquor house men across the
line are greatly Interested in the Ore
gon law, and according to word
brought from Hornbrook, at lenst
one of the big wholesalers there be
lieves the law to be unenforceable.
This man is credited with tho state
ment that "It wasn't worth while t
fight the Idaho law, as we did not
do enough business in that state, but
we do enough in Oregon to make it
worth fighting, and we will beat it."
Josephine County
Went for Hughes
Josephine county went for Hughes
by a very small majority. Other re
turns are as follows from that coun
ty: Hawley, for representative in
congress, received his usual heavy
vote, polling 1,879 to 1,146 for
Weutherford. Richards got 2S5. All
other republican nominees for state
offices received majorities slightly
less than that given Hawley.
Josephine will have a divided dele
gation in the state legislature. Sen
ator Smith, republican, was re-elected
over A. C. Hough, and Charles T.
Sweeney, democrat, representative.
over A. E. Voorhies. Two democrats
were elected to county office, W. T. '
Miller having defeated E. E. Blanch-
ard for district attorney, and Mrs.
Alice Bacon, the only woman candi
date, having defeated Lincoln Sav
age for school superintendent. The
other county officers elected were:
George T. Lewis, sheriff; Eugene
Cobtirn, clerk; George S. Calhoun,
treasurer; Ecclus Pollock, assessor;
H. C. Hall, surveyor; S. Loughridge.
coroner, and G. M. Savage, commis
sioner. Heavy majorities were recorded
against both the single tax and the
brewers' amendment.
H. T. Baughman recently returned
from a visit to bis father, Jacob
Baughman, of Woodburn, who is
years old and one of the pioneers of
the Willamette section, bale ' and
hearty for one of bis age.
