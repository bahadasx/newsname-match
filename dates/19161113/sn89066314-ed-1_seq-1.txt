of the sinking by a German submarine
of the American-Hawaiian steamer
Columbian are expected hourly. Word
has been received here that progress
is being made towam "taihgout af

day from Bob Simpson, mailed from
Stockholm, Sweden, October 17. In
this letterBob says he received two
firsts, one second and two thirds in
the Stockholm meet. This in con
tradictory to reports in several news
papers. The American team arrived at
Stockholm Friday morning, October
13. Saturday, Sunday and Monday
were spent in training for the meet
In the 200-meter hurdles, Bob won a
first in the world's record time of 25
4-5, seconds. In this race, he beat
Fred Murray to the tape by eight
yards. The hurdles used were three
feet high, the heighth over which
"Murray defeated Simpson in America
previous to the trip abroad. The race
was run off late In the afternoon and
it was so dark that the track was
lighted with electric lights. The two
Swedish runners in the race knocked
over ten hurdles between them, which
would have disqualified them in this
Wi country but against, which there is no
rule at Stockholm. Bob' did not knock
over a single hurdle.
Bob's other first was in the 110-
- meter hurdles which also gave him
another world's record of 14 4-5 sec
onds. This record appears all the
more remarkable from the fact that
110 meters Is 120 yards 10 inches.
Simpson secured second place in the
200 meter run, third in the 100 meter
- dash and third in the 60 meter dash.
Altogether, Bob received seventeen
Points at this meet which made him
individual point winner. Murray was
second with sixteen points, Loomis
third with fifteen points, Meredith
fourth with ten points and Ward fifth
ith four points. In most of the
races the Swedish runners had a bad
fault of breaking, that is, starting be
fore the gun was fired. They were
called back numerous times for this.
The form which Simpson showed in
the hurdles was new to the Swedish
ninners,
From Stockholm, the team left for
Christiana and then to Copenhagen. 1

COLUMBIA OX ALTON MAIN LINE!
Union of -'Santa. Fe and Burlington
"May Mean New Cross-State Line.
The entrance .or the Santa Fe Rail
road into St Louis, by forming a joint
line across Missouri with the Bur
lington Route, may cause the Chicago
and Alton to reach Str.Louis by pass
ing through Columbia, according to
this morning's St Louis Republic. The
proposed new tracks would' extend
from Steinmetz, near Glasgow, to Mo
kane and would touch Fayette, Co
lumbia and Fulton. From Mokane the
Alton would use the Katy tracks into
St Louis.
The Burlington and' Alton have been
allies in Missouri between St Louis
and Kansas City, the Alton owning the
line from Kansas City to Mexico and
the Burlington that from Mexico to
St Louis. The alliance between .the
Burlington "and Santa- Fe practically
will terminate the Alton-Burlington
combination and impel the Alton to
form a new short line into St Louis
if it cares much for St. Louis traf
fic. The Alton-Katy alliance would pre
sent an unusual phase, since the Mis
souri, Kansas and Texas runs its
trains into St Louis over the Burling
ton rails from West Alton:
Engineers have been reconnoiterlng
in Central Missouri between Steinmetz
and Mokane. It is assumed that they
are investigating the possibilities of a
cut-off for the Alton; This Indicates
the likelihood of a St Louis-Kansas
City alliance between the Alton and
Katy, according to the Republic.
The Alton owns a .line from Mexi
co to St Louis but the route .extends
through 'Roodhouse, ,111,, and Jhe dV
bur arrangemenl-probably would be
impracticable. The Alton might ar
range to operate its .trains over the
Wabash tracks from-Mexico to St
Louis. "But railroad executives .regard
such an arrangement as an improb
ability. The officials of the Katy refuse to
make any comment on the proposed
new Chicago and Alton route. They
say they have riot been officially in
formed. 'The Alton is looking about,
and its''milnagemeht'probablyt.ias no
definite plans. - ',
