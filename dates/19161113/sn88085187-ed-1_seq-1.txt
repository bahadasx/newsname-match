HOW DOES
THIS 111
HIT YOU?
By Mabel Abbott
"Idoas," said so-nebody
once, "are the rarest and
most valuable things in the
world."
Here's un idea—free.
It's the Idea of Mrs. M. O.
Mitchell, secretary of the
Mitchell Nursery Co.
Mrs. Mitchell, by the way,
comes pretty near being the civic
conscience of Tacoma.
Every newspaper in tbe city,
tho Commercial club, Rotary club,
school, park and other public
boards, Improvement clubs, wom
en's clubs, parent-teacli.*!i* associa
tions, business men, and every
other civic or representative body,
has learned to expect a letter
from Mrs. Mitchell about every so
often, suggesting something to bo
done for the advancement of Tu
coma, rebuking tbe failure to
grasp opportunities, or pointing
out fresh ones.
Simply Won't Down.
And these admonitions of the
civic conscience are very hard to
dispose of.
If they are referred to com
mittees and the committees don't
do something about Uiem, the
civic conscience will be heard
from again.
If they are thrown Into the
waste-basket, still they stick In
the mind, because they have such
an uncomfortable amount of com
mon-sense and merit In them.
Here's the latest one. Isn't it
good?
Preaching Beauty Now.
"We desire to ask your co-op
eration ln the organization of a
'Tacoma Beautiful' -movement this
fall, with the object of making
Tacoma known everywhere as
'The world's most beautiful city,'
also for starring and carrying on
a campaign of promotion and
publicity of the entire Northwest
as a tourist center.
"By organizing garden clubs
in every part of the city, with
each schoolhouse as a center, the
entire city would be covered. As
there are upwards of 30 school
houses a very large and effective
working corps would be available
at once.
No Burdensome Dues.
There should be no entrance
fee, and the dues should consist
of voluntary services of any kind
for the benefit of the community.
"Any expenses could he paid
pro rata or by voluntary subscrip
tion or by giving entertainments
to raise the necessary mouey.
"These garden clubs should be
under the supervision oi an ad
visory board composed of repre
sentatives from the various com
mercial organizations, school
board, park board, newspapers,
clubwomen, physicians' associa
tions, architects' associations, etc.,
who would furnish or obtain ex
pert advice on any subjects
brought to their attention by any
of the garden clubs.
Would Advertise City, Too.
"The clubs should have a Bet
of officers composed of the most
enterprising and public-spirited
citizens In each district, :ind also
a publicity committee for the pur
pose of calling attention to t'»e
natural or developed advantages
or attractions ef each particular
neighborhood, and the promotion
of the entire Northwest as a tour
ist center.
"Will you be among the leaders
in this movement?"
Tomorrow The Times will print
what some of Tacoma's most
prominent business men, as weil
as experts of national reputation,
think of Mrs. Mitchell's idea.

—"The high costo f livinb is a re
sult of just TWO factors.
One Is our departure from the
simple life, and the other Is the
machinations of those who con
trol tho supplies we need!" de
clares Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, fam
ous pure food expert and former
chief of the bureau of chemistry
of the United States agricultural
department, in discussing today
the phenomenal sqyrocketlng of
the prices of the necessities of
life.
Or. Wiley said that there is an
Individual and a soci.il problem
involved.
"Fashion is one of the principal
factors in high cost of living," he
said.
"A man's clothing will wear
him a year; a woman's clothing
must be changed three or four
times a year to meet the chang
ing fashion.
Buy Food, Not a Brand
"In the same way instead
of buying hulk we Insist on
buying brands when we buj
food. If wo would stop
buying labels and buy FOOD
we would notice a differ
ence!
"We pay for a little pack
age of biscuits holding four
ounces a price of 10 cents,
which makes 40 cents a
pound for wheat!
"And besides, the city
man can't get whole flour
wheat; fashion lias decreed
that nothing but white flour
be sold ln our grocery stores.
"If families would combine to
buy whole wheat and whole corn
and buy potatoes by the barrel and
other foods the same way—in
quantities—and a company of
famillescan easily do this, It
would help largely to solve the
problem."
Dr. Wiley says undoubtedly the
European war, combined wfth a
short crop 1b responsible for the
high price of flour, wheat and
bran,
"The only remedy for this," he
sayß, "is peace in Europe and an
other crop of wheat.
"But the European war is
not responsible for the high
cost of meat. Tbe cattle
raisers are getting the low
est prices they have received
In 40 years for their cuttle.
And yet all meats are

PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Nov.

the American revolution, just ,
given birth to another and
GREATER revolution, a tre
mendous religious revival that
will sweep America, embrace
the whole of humanity, and
establish the Kingdom of
God on earth?
if the thrilling religious events
which I have just been watching
mean what many Philadelphiane
claim they mean, then tho above
question is honestly put ln rathei
a conservative way.
I have just been studying the
astounding growth of the Stone
man Fellowship, which is nothing
more nor less than tbe BIGGEST
MAN'S BIBLE CLASS IN THE
WORLD!
It Is a church club founded by
an episcopal minister, Dr. H. C.
Stone, less than two years ago,
and now actually having a mem
bership rapidly approaching the
200,000 mark! Think of it!
Dream to Be Realized
This almost Incredible flocking
of men back to religion, declare
enthusiastic observers, proves the
reality of a gre^t spiritual awak
ening In the souls of men today
which mny make this an epoch ln
the history of religion second
only to the coming of Christ!
We are actually able to watch
under our eyes today, they claim,
a movement that will bring mil
lions back to the church, and In
fact may unify all Christendom!
Thus, tbe dream of the church
in all ages may be realized! And
America, the materialistic, the
rich and worldly, may become a
second Holy Land!

What Is the basis for these
marvelous prophesies?
Certain amazing facts. As to
the conclusions based on them,
each observer will have his own.

KELLY TO PUSH
ROAD PROGRAM
The speaker of the next house
of representatives of the Wash-
ington legislature will be a Taco
ma man.
Guy E. Kelly, elected from the
3 6th district last week, has re
turned to Tacoma after a swing
about the state, with 58 pledges
pledged, ho says.
E. H. Guie of Seattle, the only
other representative who has been
contesting the speakership with
the Tacoma man, gave up the
fight Monday, it was reported au
thoritatively, and released all of
his friends.
"Road legislation is to
be one of the big things before
tho 1917 legislature," declared
the speaker-to-be Monday.
For Road Program.
"I propose to do all in my pow
er to continue the present good
road work, along lines adopted in
1913. Some persons say that the
road levy is too high, nut if chey
could see the wonderful work
done in Washington and the groat
benefits done to everyone by the
development of roads, I believe
they would withdraw their objejc
tions.
"In Eastern Washington farm
ers haul their goods 100 miles to
market ln automobiles. Five
years ago they could not have
made a 10-mlle trip."
The non-partisan ballot will
cause one of the bitterest fights
ln the coming legislature It is
expected. The petitions now be
ing signed all over Washington
asking for a non-partisan ballot
at the state and county primaries,
will come before the next legisla
ture for action. The stato legis
lators are divided keenly on this
point.
Wants New Constitution.
"The coming legislature will In
all probability start the ball roll
ing for a new constitution of the
state of Washlngon," said Repre
sentative Kelly Monday.
"There are so many criticisms
of the present constitution that
it seems almost Imperative that
some action be taken.
"If the vote is affirmative,
then the 1919 legislature will de
vise ways and means of tearing
the constitution to pieces and
drawing up a new one.
"Every man in the coming leg
islature is 'dry.' There is utter
ly no possibility of any 'wet' leg
islation.
Maybe No Booze Legislation.
"In fact, I do not believe
there will be any liquor legisla
tion at all. The legislature feels
that this question is one which
the people Inaugurated, and
should be left solely ln the hands
of the people."
Kelly says that he has made no
promises of committee appoint
