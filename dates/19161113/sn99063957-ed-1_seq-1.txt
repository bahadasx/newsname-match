London, Nov. 13.-Russians, Rumanians and Franco
Serbians are continuing their hammering against the
lines of the central powers on every eastern and south-eastern
front today. At some points Germans and Aus
trians are attacking fiercely, but according to advices at
all the capitals, the larger successes are being won by the
arms of the" entente allies. French troops are today co
ordinating the trenches and positions they wrested from
the Germans yesterday at Sailly-Sailliser in the west
front, at which point sporadic German attempts to recap
; ture the positions are goingon with increasing intensity.
A comparative lull obtains on other sections of the west
ern front. : ;
;. The fighting about Cernavoda for possession of the
'great Danube span that forms the biggest bridge in
Europe and where for days the Russian right wing is re
ported from Petrograd to have partly succeeded in turn
ing Mackensen's left flank, apparently has reached its
most critical stage. .
. : Since the dispatches which told of Cernavoda in flames
and of Constanza, where the German-Bulgarian extreme
right has had its base on the Black sea, fired, only meager
details have reached here regarding the Dobrudja clash.
Military experts believe the result at Cernavoda will
' depend partly on the fifty mile' forward. dash of Russo
- Rumanians against. General Falkenhayn's -. armies in
Transylvania far below the Bukowinian border ' where
defensive movements have been ' succeded by a sledge-'
hammer offensive! Anv measureable successes in this
. region the experts believe must weaken the Cernavoda
Constanza front of Mackensen. . .
. Bulgars, reinforced after Friday's Sebro-Frencn suc-
'cesses on the Cerna front, apparently! have failed to stem
the advances, for King Peter's headquarters last night re
ported further material progress, including advancement
of the allied lines and taking of considerable booty. -
Do Not Confirm Report.
Berlin, Nov. 13. German troops still

Germany's Great System
of Underground Forts Is
Pronounced Inpregnable
By Carl W. Aciurman .
(United Press staff correspondent)
Somewhere on the Bommo, Nov. 10.
Via Berlin and wirclcs to Sayvillc,
Nov. 13. Germany Is defending the
Somme with buried artillery.
In their assaults the French and Brit
ish are attacking only the surface of
the greatest fortifications in the world.
Germany built a surprise for the al
lies in ber wonderful scries of artillery
proof fortifications. These defenses are
built so close, are dug so deep and -over
such a wide area that the allies are
today attacking with infantry, tanks
and artillery, are only on the outskirts
of a powerful system of underground
forts. .'
Tho bombardment is terrific. Fields,
woods and towns are torn to pieces by
constantly exploding shells. But under
ground nothing is toucneu. Ann it is
from her sub-surface forts that Ger
many is repelling the allied attack.
roPa week I have been over tne toin-
me battle fieiu. rom a neigni near
I'eroune and to the south of Arras, our
party twice penetrated the shell area
viewing Perotnne. and Bapaume, Jtlre
two immediate objocts of fire.
Defenses Are Buried
It marked the first time since the
Somme battle began that a neutral has
been permitted to inspect tins part or
the underground .fortification con
structed by the Teutonic forces. While
waiting in the library of a castle erv-J
iug as a headquarter of one of the
commanding generals, the windows rat
tled and doors shook from the couens
sion of bursting shells.
With -these constant explosions in
our ears nnd escorted bv an intelligence
officer, we motored to the height of
Bapaume. There we watched the Brit
ish fire on a town. The only church
spire anil one chimney is atill stund-
ing.

These advances were agTeed upon by
