asha so forcefully that Col. Harvey
and his associates will see that we are
in earnest about it and ready to do
our full duty. I hope to see our citi
zens turn out at the meeting tomor
row evening in order that we may
make plans that will assure us a fair
chance at getting the proposed road.
Chickasha would be sure to derive
vast benefits from being on a great
highway of national travel. We can

cf the camps of which he escaped on
October 12.
This is the second time within a

hands of tho force of Sheriff Hodge
Bailey and a desire to go to his wife

I Coins is charged with horse stealing
and is credited with being as slippery

j A year ago Sheriff Bailey received
I word from the fiheritf at Plainview,
Texas, that Coins was wanted for
j horse stealing and that it was believed

Tuttle, Grady county. Coins was

Having been farmed out on the Ham
place, from which point he escaped
from the convict guards last month,
he made his way to a point near Tut
tie in which vicinity his wife is now
residing. Here, after careful search
he was located and arrested last week,
by Deputy Sheriff Dan Snell and was
being brought to Chickasha by that
officer when he jumped from the car
and madd good his escape but was
again caught by Deputy Snell after
several days of hard work and landed
in jail here! Though young Coins is
I pxrendintrlv smooth in tho wavf. of the
world and while hero Ao has been

of License Law Until After Next
Council Meeting
OTHER PARTS OF TRAFFIC
LAW EFFECTIVE
Council and Mayor Both of Opinion that
Dollar License Section Should
Be Repealed
No prosecutions will he instituted at
present, for violation of that section of
tho traffic ordinance which requires
automobile owners and drivers to pro
cure licenses at the cost of $1 each
nor for that requiring them to pass ex
aminations as to their competency, nor
will any arrests bo made for these vio
lations before the date of the next
meeting of the city council which will
bo Thursday, the 23rd," declared May
or Coffman this morning. "Both the
city council and I are of the opinion
that that section of the law should be
repealed requiring the dollar payment
for an automobile license but we are
firm in tho conviction that every auto
mobile owner should take out a li
cense free of charge for his own pro
tection as well as for tho protection
of the general public. As to the exam
ining fee nothing further will be dono
until the next meeting of the council
but personally I do not believe that
that would run counter to tho law, as
it is not just that the members of the
board should give ail the time that is
required in tho performance of their
duties withor.t remuneration.'
"While tho Oklahoma City author
ties charge for every license which Is
issued by the city clerk and requires
every automobilevpwner to own one,
