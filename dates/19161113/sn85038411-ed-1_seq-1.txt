U-BOAT PROBLEM
TO BE TAKEN UP
FIRST BY WILSON
Back at Desk After Absence;
Concerned Over Make-lip
of Next House
QUIET ON ELECTION
Plans Rest Before Short Ses
sion; MeCormick Considered
For the Cabinet
Washington, D. C., Nov. 13.—Presi
dent Wilson was back at his desk in
the White House to-day after an ab
sence o£ two months, prepared to take
up important foreign problems which
have been held In abeyance pending
the election as well as domestic ques
tions. These included the German
submarine situation, the Mexican
problem and a number of federal ap
pointments.
The President was expected to con
sider first the submarine situation
which is admittedly serious. A sum
mary of recent developments in Ger
man submarine warfare, prepared by
the State Department, was ready to be
laid before him and, in addition he
probably soon will confer again with
Ambassador Gerard on the situation.
The President has not even con
sidered the question of changes in his
cabinet according to administration
officials who characterize as prema
ture reports that he had decided on
such changes. It is possible, how
ever, that one or two cabinet officers
may not remain after March 4.
Although Mr. Wilson was tired out
when he returned to the White House
last night he was up early to-day and
had breakfast before 8 o'clock. Im
mediately afterward he began reading
a huge stack of mail accumulated dur
ing his trip to WUHamstown, Mass.
Concerned Over House
The President asked first for the
latest information on the political
make-up of the House of Representa
tives in the Sixty-fifth Congress. He
was told Indications from present re
turns were that the Republicans
would have 217 members and the

Nine Drown When Big
Automobile Stage Plunges
Through Draw in River
Vancouver, B. C., Nov. 13.—Nine
persons at least, including two women,
were drowned in the Fraser river near
here last night when an automobile
stage from Ladner, B. C„ plunged
through an open draw of the bridge
and went to the bottom of the stream.
Divers had succeeded to-night in re
covering eight of the bodies. Three
survivors were picked up by a lifeboat
from a river tug. In the absence of
definite Information as to the number
of passengers carried on the stage it
was feared by officials here that the
death list might be increased to 12.
The driver, George Smith, was among
the drowned.
According to the survivors, Smith
failed to observe the warning lights
on the bridge which signalled that the
draw was open and the heavy ma
chine ran unchecked through the
wire gates into the river.
Alderman DeShong Is
Mandamused Into Court
Because he has refused to turn
over a transcript of the proceedings
instituted by W. S., and Arthur Stam
baugh against George R. Reese, Al
derman James B. DeShong to-day was
mandamused into the Dauphin coun
ty court to produce a transcript of
the records. He must answer within
five days.
Attorney Fred Miller who repre
sents the Stambaugh brothers asked
for the mandamus. He said that the
alderman has steadfastly declined to
deliver a transcript until the costs are"
paid by the prosecutor who lost the
case. Miller said his clients are will
ing to give security for the costs if
an appeal is decided against them but
DeShong, according to the attorney,
has declined to produce a copy of his
records.

I :
To Diminish in Intensity, but
City Will Get Taste of
Real Wintev
Real winter weather including snow
J and ice is due this week in Harrisburg.
' According to a dispatch from Wash
; ington, a cold wave, which is breaking
all records west of the Mississippi
river for this time of the year, is mov
! ing toward the Atlantic coast,
j Local observer, E. R. Demain, cor
: roborated the dispatch from Washing
ton and added: "The city will get
.something like real winter about to
! morrow." The cold spell is expected
|to last until Saturday or Sunday.
: Whether it will bring skating at Wild
! wood can be told more positively to
morrow. One thing is certain, the
j temperature will go below freezing
; point.
Cold Winter Ahead?
According to an old legend regard
ing St. Martin's Day, which dawned
j bright and early Saturday, a severe
j winter may be expected.
! On the other hand, had the day
j been raw and dismal, many persons
[would have accepted this as proof
| positive that the winter is to be mild.
; For so runs the legend.
I During the fourth century when St.
■ Martin was a soldier under Constan
jtinus at Amiens, France, ho cut his
j cloak in two parts with his sword and
I gave half of it to a beggar. Accord
ling to the story, that night he had a
| dream in which he saw Christ wear
ling the garment he had given the beg
jgar. He immediately realized that his
' charity had been extended to Christ
i himself.
I In later years French peasants, who
Iliad learned the story, circulated the
j legend that if the. day was cold on the
| anniversary of St. Martin's death, the
winter months would be mild. After
the young soldier's generous gift they
believed that Christ had tempered the
weather in order that he might not
j suffer from the cold.
20 Below in Wyoming
I The Washington dispatch says:
! "A cold wave with temperature at
| various places lower than ever before
'recorded in November, overspreads the
! region west of the Mississippi to-day
j and will move eastward to the Atlantic
I coast. Sheridan, Wyo., reported the
I lowest temperature with 26 degrees
j below zero: Lander, Wyo., 24 degrees
! below zero and Cheyenne, Wyo., Yel-
I lowstone National Park aud Havre,
j Mont., 20 degrees below zero. The
j intense cold reached southward into
the interior of Texas.
] Weather Bureau officials to-day said
the cold wave perhaps would diminish
in intensity as it moved eastward. Its
movement and intensity was some
j what dependent, they pointed out,
• u on the West Indian disturbance
(which was reported this morning in
the Caribbean sea in the vicinity of
: Swan Island. That storm was ap-
I parently increasing in intensity and
I will move northward, probably at
tended by strong winds reaching gale
force during the next 36 hours over
the east portion of the Gulf of Mexico
land South Florida.
Rain and snow probably will pre
cede the cold wave in the north Atlan
tic States, "Great Lakes region, Ohio
Valley and Tennessee. The cold will
strike the Ohio Valley, Tennessee and
the Gulf States to-night and the At
lantic States, except south Florida, on
Tuesday. Cold wave warnings have
been issued for Mississippi, Alabama,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana and
Southwest Ohio.

Report of Railroad Police Is
Submitted For Court's
Consideration
To the protests of tlie Dauphin
County No-License League and the
congregation of Messiah Lutheran
Church against the transfer of the
Theodore F. Frye hotel from 501 State
street to 1012 North Seventh was add
ed to-day the vigorous objection of
the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.
That there are enough saloons in
this section now', that the new stand is
too close to the Herr street subway
and the railroad shops, that the char
acter of the clientele which Frye will
likely serve to increase "unlawfulness"
in the neighborhood, and that men
and women of both races frequent
hotels in that section, are the reasons
upon which the railroad company
liases its objections.
The company's reasons were set
forth in a report on the matter which
was submitted to W. H. McCaleb. su
perintendent of the Philadelphia divi
sion of the Pennsylvania railroad by
Captain Paul Barclay of the railroad
police.
The Pennsy's Pro (est
The letter was presented in court
to-day when the application for trans
fer was heard by President Judge
Kunkel and Additional Law Judge Mc-
Carrell. W. J. Carter, counsel for
Frye objected to the admission of the
letter and Judge Kunkel explained that
the communication will be tiled subject
to the objection with the understand
ing that the court may or may not
call tor testimony to support any of
the allegations.
On the witness stand Frye vigorous
ly denied that white men or women
are permitted to drink together in his
State street hotel.
Frye is compelled to move from his
present quarters because the State is
about to take over his property for
Capitol park extension purposes. At
license court last February Frye tried
to move into now quarters in North
Seventh street, but withdrew the ap
plication in the face of vigorous ob
jections.

WANT BRITISH

FRENCH GAINS
Call on Great Britain to Take
Over More of Western Front
and Believe France
London, Nov. 13. The Express
features un article in to-day's issue by
a French military writer. Captain
Philippe Millet calling on Great
Britain to take over more of the
Western front and relieve the French.
Captain Millett says it is necessary
to speak plainly, that the alliance of
Great Britain and France cannot be
based on a mere exchange of compli
ments and that all French men are
wondering whether the' English fully
realize what is happening in France.
He says the French recognize grate
fully what Great Britain has already
done but feels that the time has come
for the British army to relieve the
French more efficiently.
The writer cites utterances of
French deputies to support his claim
and reniurks that the British are
holding only 150 kilometers of the
front compared to the French 580
kilometers. He adds:
"There is not one village In
where the people do not expect our
friends to enable us, after 27 months'
hard struggle, to have some rest dur
ing the third winter and prepare for
an advance next year without having
to exhaust ourselves. This is what
our people feel. They have put their
trust in Great Britain and they all ex
pect the relief of a good bit of the
French line to be made soon."
CHEAP FORGER ARRESTED
Charged with attempting to pass a
fraudulent check, Hoscoe Stakley was
