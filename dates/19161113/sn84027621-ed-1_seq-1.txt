The announcement from London
that the British had opened an attack
on both sides of the Ancre river in
Northern France indicated the possi
bility that an important new offensive
has begun. The Ancre river is ap
proximately the'southern boundary of
the salient created in the German
lines by the entente offensive. Broad
ly speaking, the salient extended
about eighteen mides northward to
Arras, but the official statement 'does
not make plain whether the new op
eration covered the entire breadth or
was merely an attempt to crush the
southern sector.
Berlin announced that German ar
tillery yesterday "broke up entente ef
forts on the Somme front and said
French attempt to advance in Alsaca
failed.
I The Germans claimed the capture
of three towns from the Rumanians
I on the Transylvanian front, together
I with more than a thousand prisoners.
I Bucharest reported the Rumanians
sHield their ground to the northeast of
j Campulung but admitted a retirement
on the right bank of the river Alt.' .

a majority of the German torpedo
boats which on Friday participated In
a bombardment in the Finland gulf
were sunk.

FI1IICE ID FARMING
Excellent Results Follow the Interest
Taken In and Aid Given by, Bank-
rers to , Agriculturists
Three years ago the v American
Bankers Association established 1 an
agricultural bureau with a commis
sion of seven bankers to run it, the
chairman being B. F. Harris of the
irst -National Bank of Champaign,
11. Mr. Harirs remained at the head
of this commission until the recent
meeting of the association at Kansas
City when Joseph Hirsch of the
Corpus Christi National Bank of
Corpus Christi, Texas, took his place.
Mr. Harris . established a paper
published at the expense of the Am
erican Bankers Association and called
it the Banker-Farmer. It is published
monthly and each issue is filled with
matter, not only interesting, but very
instructive to both bankers and farm
ers. It is so general in its scope that
no man in either of these lines of bus
iness can fail to find helpful reading
in it. Three of the more prominent
efforts of this paper have been:
1st. To establish active commit
tees on agriculture in' state bankers
associations and forty-five states now
have them. . -
2nd. To impress upon county com
missioners everywhere tne import
ance of having a county demonstra
tion agent and showing how part of
the expense is borne by the United
States under the Smith-Lever act.
3nd. To show the necessity of pro
viding more conveniences for farmer's
wives and the betterment of country
schools.
These are not the only lines of
work undertaken but are some of the
more prominent. In order to . show in
part the appreciation of this work,-1
quote from statistics furnished by the
United States department of agricul
ture to the new chairman of the ag
ricultural commission of the Ameri
can Bankers Association at its recent
meeting in Kansas City: 7 , ' 7
"In 1915 over 20,000 southern farm
ers, employing demonstration meth
ods on 218,000 acres, produced an
average yield of 1,180 pounds of seed
cotton per acre and 56,000 farmers
employing demonstration methods .on
480,000 acres, produced an average
yield of 37.7 bushels of seed corn per
acre. Figuring lint cotton at ten cents
the pound and corn at 75 cents the
bushel the cotton demonstrations
show an increased value of approxi
mately $4,000,000, and the corn ex
periments an increased value of ap
proximately $7,000,000 over the av
erage products of cotton and corn on
equal acreages. Demonstrations in
oats, wheat, rye, barley and other
staples, show equally amazing re
sults." It is well for farmers and bankers
too, to remember that if the county
agents in one section of the - South
have added $11,000 to the value of cot
ton and corn alone, that activities by
these same agents, in other lines and
in other parts of the United States,
must run into fabulous sums.
To bring the value of the county
agent nearer home, I may state that
the Marion county banks could not
have undertaken the pig club work re
cently done so successfully, without
the assistance of Mr. Blacklock. This
modest undertaking has put into Mar
ion county 48 registered Hampshire
sows which have already farrowed
more than 100 pigs and the county
will have, in less than 30 days, more
than 300 hogs eligible for registra
tion.
The members of the agricultural
committee for te Florida Bankers
Association held a meeting in Ocala
last week and, while its labors cover
ed other work also, it received reports
of the pig club work financed by
bankers as follows: 7 T
Hernando county, 30 pigs; Hills
borough county, 32 pigs; Polk county,
8 pigs; Pinellas county, 50 pigs; Clay
county, 10 pigs; Brevard county, 100
pigs; Duval county, pigs; Suwanee
county, 28 pigs; Taylor county, 30
pigs; Putnam county, 12 pigs; Marion
county, 48 pigs. Total, 350 pigs.
There are other counties where the
work is under way The work we are
doing is rather in the way of blazing
a. trail but it will be followed up. One
thing the Florida committee has set
tled upon and that is that every Flor
ida county must have a demonstra
tion agent and get its benefit from
the Smith-Lever fund.

Washington, Nov. 12. President
Wilson came back to Washington last
night ready totake up waiting public
problems and begin framing plans for
his second term in the White House.
He has been away two months.
The president has made it clear to
friends that the policy toward sub
marine warfare outlined in the corre
spondence on the Sussex case will be
followed strictly. In his campaign
speeches he declared that in case the
administration was : defeated at the
election it would have difficulty in
dealing with foreign problems be
tween now and March 4. Now that he
has been re-elected, however, he is

The Hague, Netherlands, Nov. 13.
About 2,000 unemployed in the Bel
gian city of Ghent have been reported
to Germany for work in munition fac
tories, according to news from the
frontier. A compulsory registration
of unemployed took plays a few days
since, and the, present labor compul
sion is the sequel thereto. Former em
ployes of various engineering works
at Ghent -who gave no heed to the
call, were seized in their beds at
night by. German soldiers and thrown
into prison, it is alleged.
Other instances of the imposition
of forced labor have recently occurr
ed at Bruges, Eekfoo, near Ghent, and
other places. All signs indicate that
Germany is determined, so far as pos
sible, to utilize the considerable avail
able supply of Belgian labor to make
good the ever-increasing military
drain on its own man power.

poses. SESSION OF EDUCATIONAL
ASSOCIATION AT SPARR
Last Saturday was a red letter day
for county educational interests at
Sparr. Promptly at 10 in the morn
ing the large body of teachers and
trustees and patrons assembled at
the Baptist church .with Mr. Miller of
the Griner Farm school chairman, and
Mrs. Wesson of the Ocala school, secretary.-
After opening devotional exercises,
the program was opened by the read
ing by Miss Prances Ramsey o the
Moss Bluff school of an original paper
on "School Visiting by Patrons and
Trustees." The paper was full of in
formation and valuable suggestions
and the readers of the Star willhave
the opportunity of reading it in full.
A very free discussion followed the
paper indulged in by teachers, trus
tees and patrons.
v Next came dinner in the oak grove
R. F. Connor of the Ocala schools on
the "Practical Teaching of Agricul
ture in Our Schools' The paper was
interesting and ' full of practical sug
gestions and brought out a very full
discussion at its' close. 7
Nevt came dmner in the oak grove
between thefcwo churches and for an
hour the people of the community and
the teachers and visitors from the
various parts of the county mingled
in pleasant social intercourse and
partook of the bountiful and elegant
spread laid out before them by the
good people of the community.
Before adjourning for dinner, the
association went into business session
and had a most cordial invitation pre
sented from the Fellowship school

school house. By unanimous vote the
vote was accepted.

KILLED A CATAMOUNT
There came into Jhe Star office Sat
urday morning Hayden Owens, a 16-year-old
boy, living four miles west
01 town on tne Martei road, wno
brought with him the skin of one of
the largest catamounts ever killed in
this territory. Hayden was out in the
woods the other day, looking for
squirrels, when he suddenly found
himself in less than ten yards of the
big cat, which was trying to sneak up
on a bunch of quail and therefore did
not see the boy. Hayden had a single
barreled shotgun, loaded with No. 6
shot, and without an instant's hesi
tation fired,- bringing the catamount
down. The animal measured 44 In
ches from tip to tip and its skin was
a pretty piece of; fur. This is the
second catamount this boy has killed.
He sold the skin of the first one for
fifty cents, and we hope he will raake
a better bargain of the second, for if
the skin is properly dressed it will be
worth several dollars. We advised
him to exhibit it at the fair. He de
serves great credit for his pluck and
quickness, because a wildcat of that
size is almost as formidable as a
panther. ' Many a city sportsman
would give a hundred dollars to be
able to say he had made such a good
shot.
