FOR DELAY IN
GAS LINE WORK
Extension Held Up at Capitol,
Says Company,
Work' on the building of an additional
gas pipeline into Oklahoma City to
avoid a repetition of gas stiortage this
winter is delayed near the capitol site I
pending decision by property owners
on the laying out of streets and boule
vards between Lincoln boulevard and
the Santa Fe rarVrtwd, according tn an
nouncement today by officials of the
Oklahoma Gas and Electric company.
Owners Delay Work.
The line has been constructed to the
street immediately north of the capital
building and it can not be brought on
down to Seventeenth strert. it is said,
until property owners decide on what
they are going to do in the matter of
laying out streets.
Members of the capitol building
commission stated that the commission
had nothing to do with the plans and
that no part of the work on the gas
line was held up awaiting any action
by the commission.
Low Pressure Reported.
In some sections of the city this
morning slight gas shortages were re
ported. I.ow gas pressure reported from West
Ninth street was explained by Henry
Willmering. an official of the Okla
homa Gas & Electric company as due
to small feed pipes from the street
mains into the houses. These pipes, he
said, were laid when artificial gas
was used in Oklahoma Citv, and have
never been relaid.
At the plant of the gas company it
was reported that the gas pressure was
normal and that barring unforsren ac
cidents to the main from the Sapulpa
field or an unusually low temperature,
Oklahoma City is assured plenty of gas
this winter.
Maay Complaints Made.
Mayor Overholser this morning re
ceived numerous complaints from many
sections of the city that the gas pres
sure was very low. Unite a number of
the "kicks" came from occupants of the
citv hall.

clerks and stenographers were keeping
close to the radiators trying to combat
the cold.
