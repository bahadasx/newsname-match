THK KAGLH'S CIUUiDS.
No. 5. Joy of Work.
Men do best what they like best.
A man will tittle succeed for himself or for others
who considers his work as a hardship.
In employing helpers, learn their attitude of mind.
Get men, if you can, who go at the job as a ball-player
goes to bat '
Get men who think more of the winning than they do
of the recompense.
Most of the big things are being done by men who
don't need money. They are done for the joy of doinc.
And joy-work is done well.
Some men object to calling business a game. We
like that description of it. When our office ceases to seem
a play-ground we shall think we belong elsewhere.
We lock for helpers who see only the goal, and not the
rough road that leads there. And we believe that every
one whom we serve is glad that we find it fun.
