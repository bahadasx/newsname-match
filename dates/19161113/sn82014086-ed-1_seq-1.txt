RUSSIAN COMMENT ON
RE-ELECTION OF WILSON.
Conclude He Will No Longer Be
Bound by Political Prudence.
Petrograd, Nov. IS, 3 p." m., via Lon
don, 11.1b p. m. The Russian news
papers comment briefly and reservedly
on the re-election of President Wilson,
confining themselves in general to the
conclusion that a more decisive foreign
policy is as much to be expected under
Mr. Wilson as it would have been
under Mr. Hughes.
The Novoe Vremla looks for a more
determined attitude on the part of the
American government toward subma
rine warfare "now that President Wil
Bon la no longer preoccupied with the
poltical campaign."
It adds: "American political history
snows that the president usually com
mits himself to a more definite policy
during his second administration.
President Wilson will not now be
bound by consideration of political pru
dence and will show greater freedom of
action. The victorious condition can
not help seeing that half the nation
require from him not so much pacific
Ism as dignity. He declared a year
ago that he would not permit piracy,
but, busy with the election, he has
not had time to make good his pro
nouncement, and Germany has contin
ued to sink ships at the very shores of
America. He1 must now show that his
declaration is not mere words."
The Bourse Gazette says that since
the election depended more on Internal
than international issues the result
cannot greatly Interest Europe. It
adds: "The American nation endorses
President Wilson's policy of 'peace.' It
has voted for a president who exerted
all his energy to prevent the country
from going to war and at the same
time tried to maintain national digni
ty. But recent German submarine at
tacks show how difficult it is to ac
complish both of these aims. The
moment will come when America will
be go full of gold that It will not need
to pump more wealth out of Europe.
Perhaps by, or before, this time Presi
dent Wilson's role of pacifist will
end."

BRITISH PATROL BOAT
FLEW AMERICAN FLAG?
Ran Down a Rowboat After Destroying
German Submarine U-41;
Berlin. Nov. 12 (By Wireless-to Say-
ville). A deep impression has been
made on the German public by the re
cent report from the admiralty that a
British patrol boat, flying the Ameri
can flag, after destroying the German
submarine U-41, deliberately ran down
a rowboat containing the two survivors
of the submarine's crew in an endeavor
to remove the only witnesses.
"Indignation is growing in Germany
says the Overseas News agency, "and
the excitement is stimulated by the
fact that German submarines return'
ing from trips report again and again
that they have been attacked treacher
ously by hostile merchantmen. These
cases furnish proof that the instruc
tions given by the British admiralty in
May of last year, a copy of which was
found on the steamship Woodfield, are
still in force. According to these in
structions armed trading ships are to
attack submarines on sight."

REPUBLICANS MAY HAVE
MAJORITY IN HOUSE
They Have a Plurality of Four, With
a Few Districts Still in Doubt.
Washington, Nov. 12. Members of
the house of representatives in the
newly elected sixty-fifth congress face
one of the most uncertain organization
situations in the history of the gov
ernment.
With a few districts still in doubt,
the republicans appear to have a plu
rality of four or five members and a
possible majority of two or three,
when It is figured that an independent
elected in Massachusetts and a pro
gressive elected in Minnesota probably
will vote with them for organization
purposes. Independence of action has
characterized the action of a number
of the elected members of the repub
lican side and their attitude toward
democratic legislation in the last few
years has given democratic leaders
cause for hope that some of them
might carry their independence into
the organization of the next house.
On the face of the unofficial returns
the political division of the house is
so clean that an effective and certain
working majority does not exist.
While there might be a few changes
when the official returns are . counted,
the chances are that these would not
materially alter the general result. In
view of the situation, democratic
leaders think It improbable that Pres
ident Wilson will call an extra session
of the new congress next spring. In
that case the organization fight will
not come until the regular session In
December, 1917, which will mean ma
noeuvering for more tha na year in
the contest for speakership of the
house and tha organization of impor
tant committees.
As matters stand today.. the candi
date of the republicans' for speaker
will be James R. Mann, the present
mnority leader, and Speaker Clark
generally is regarded as the democra
tic choice to succeed himself.

added to the horrors of the situation."

ARRANGING FOR PROSECUTION
OF KARL ARMGAARD GRAVES
For Attempting to Extort $3,000 From
Countess Von Bernstorff.
Washington, Nov. 12. rrangements
for the ipresecution of Karl Armgaard
Graves, self-styles "master spy" and
magazine writer who was arrested here
yesterday on a charge of attempting
to extort 53,000 rrom Countess von
Bernstorff, wife of the German ambas
sador, willate completed tomorrow at
a conference between agents of the de
partment of justice, representatives of
the district attorney's office and Prince
Hatzfeldt, counsellor of the German
embassy.
The name of Emperor William of
Germany may be brought into the case
indirectly as a result of this confer
ence. A diplomatic representative In
a foreign country cannot divest him
self of his immunity from giving; tes
timony without special permission from
his sovereign; As Graves conversed
solely with Princeton Hatzfeldt. it mav
be that the district attorney's office
will determine that his testimonfly is
essential.
It is not expected that either Count
ess von Bernstorff or the German am
bassador will be requested to appear
against Graves. The warrant was
sworn out by A. Bruce Bieliski, chief
of the bureau of investigation of the
department of Justice as the complain
ing witness.
The warrant is made out on two
counts. One charges attempt to ex
tort, penalty for which is five years'
imprisonment or a tine or Sl.ooo, or
both. The other charges that Graves
brought into the District of Columbia
letters obtained by theft; the .penalty
for this offense being nearly as severe
as ror the first one.
