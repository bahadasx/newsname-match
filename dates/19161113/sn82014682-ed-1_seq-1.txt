SEVERAL MEMBERS OF OFFICIAL FAMILY WILL POSSIBLY

TRATION AT SHORT SESS 0N
WASHINGTON. D. C, Nov. 13. -President Wilson, back at Lis office
siter two months sj.ent at Shadow Lawn and on his campaign tour facd
ser;ous international problems as )e took up his work again.
.He has been busy since coming back with conferences and looking over
papers dealing with the submarine crisis and the tangled and ominov
Mexican situation.
He expected to give first consideration to the submarine situation an
it is admitted to be serious. . The attacks ou the British horne- transirt
.Marina and the American-Hawaiian steamer Columbian have brought be
lore the government several pressing questkiis of llcv, involving Ger
many's pledges to safeguard the livej of neutrals a;ld non-combatants at
sea. . .; ;
The president has not given any extended consideration to the ques
tion of changes In his cabinet, it is said by those close to him. There
is a possibility that several of the present members of the "official fam
ily' will not remain in the cabinet after March 4. when Mr. Wilson enters
his second term. They will retire for personal reasonsaccording to the
well defined gossip around Washington.
; Because of the improbability that the house will have a Democratic
majority, the president is planning to secure certain legislation which he
considers important during the short session this winter. As much as pos
sible of hi.s preferred program will be put through at this time.
Tlie president made no statement yesterday ond he is expected to re
irain mute regarding the attitude he expects to take until the Republlcaa
leaders have admitted his victory and their own defeat.
The president expressed' himself as pleased at the result of the ballot
ing on the border, especially among the Minnesota troops. The vote
in the state gives Minnesota to Mr. Hughes by with several pre
cincts still to .e heard from, but tha soldier vote is favoring Mr. Wilson
by a ratio of about 14 to 12.
PLAN BIG LEGISLATIVE .PROGRAM
Administration leaders declare that they intend to exert themseives to
complete the Democratic program before the. adjournment of the next ses
sion of congress. Many measures are to be introduced by the Bourbon
leaders, they, say, all of them along the lines, already urged "by Mr. Wilson
and his lie.utena.its. .
Among other measures which are regarded as being certain to come
up for consideration this coming winter will be a bill i.rovldlne for Immi
gration reform. It Was pointed out
iCQosiandtclarfiU jQr,a.irefptJu.,of Uve
, MANY MEASURES ARE CONTEMPLATED
Th.? corrupt practise act now in force, it was asserted, falls ihort of
what the president wishes to see fa operation, and another measure era
bodying the id as of Mr. Wilson will almost certainly be Introduced In th
lower house early in the eomlns ses
Still another bill imposing further restrictions unon camoalsn exnen-
ditures is contemplated. while the
push -through; if possible measures
vising the existing railroad laws, and
mitting the organization of collective selling agencies abroad and for. a
more elaborate scheme of national defense.
Both Republican and Democratic leaders admit that the members of
the lower house of congress face one of the strangest and most uncertain
organization situations in the history of the nation. There are at present
a few districts doubtful, but there is apparently a Republican majority of
three In the house.
INDEPENDENTS HOLD BALANCE OF POWER
This majority, acknowledge the G..O. P. leaders, is obtained only by
figuring in the congressmen elected on the Independent ticket ln Mas
sachusetts, and the Progressive member from Minnesota. It is believed
that these members will vote for and with the Republicans for organiza
tion purposes, although it i3 possible that they may swing to the Demo
crats. -
There is little likelihood that the official recount of the ballots will
make any change In this situation, although It Is pjssible In one or two
districts. The delegates from New Mexico, Pennsylvania and North Caro
lina are doubtful.
Minority Loader Mann of Illinois and Champ Clark of Missouri, now
speaker of the house, are likely to be the two candidates for the shaker
ship when the house meets. A ,
Whatever happens it is certain that the Republicans will not be able to
control legislation, for the Democrats will iiave a working majority of 12
in the senate. '' .
PRESIDENT IS GIVEN i
OVATION ON HIS WAY
HOME TO WASHINGTON
NEW YORK. N. Y., Nov. 12. Presi
dent and Mrs. Wilson passed through
Albany pnd Troy yesterday evening on
their way to this city from Williams-
town, Massachusetts. In each city the
president was given an ovation and
crowded with congratulations on the
outcome of Tuesday's voting. Crowd3
gathered at the railroad stations with
bands, while the whistles of the ma
jority of the manufacturing plants in
the two cities blew their welcome
to the successful candidate.
The president spent last night here
and will be in the city until thi3 even
ing, when he leaves for Washington.
No Glimmer of Hope
While the total vote in some of the
states has not jet been definitely de
termined, there appears to exist no
further possibility of any change of
material benefit to Mr. Hughes, while
there is some possibility cf the Min
nesota vote being thrown into the
Democratic column.
The vote of tLe Minnesota guards
men on the border has been slightly in
a majority tor uugnes, but even witn
this his lead last night was only 218,
with some precincts yet to report It
is claimed that the missing precincts
are for Wilson, but by how much Is
not known.
TAKES UP LAND CASE
W. H. Ileen, a deputy attorney
general, left for Maul on Saturday to
represent the government in a land
question.
Last month the government obtain
