California unofficially standing at

Attorneys and checkers represent

state central committees watched
the count carefully, the watch be
ing particularly so in Los Angeles
and Alameda counties, where sev
t ral important changes were made
in the unoilicial count.
There is little talk of fraud and
consequently small hint that a, re
count might he demanded by the
republicans, although decision on
this is being held .in. abeyance for
the outcome of the tally.
The lepublicans are pitting their
sope on sulfkienL minor changes in
many pretincts to change the state
total enough to throw the state to
Hughes. They point out that an
average of one change in every
other one of the 5.S70 precincts
would more tnan do this. They
also are hoping that Carlston, lead
