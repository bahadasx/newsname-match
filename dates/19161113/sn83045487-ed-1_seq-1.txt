TEDDY ROOSEVELT MAY
BE THE NEXT POLICE
CHIEF OF CHICAGO
Rumor That Big Bill May Tender the Position to Him
Mayor Says He's Through With Politics Will
Not Run for Office Again.
Can you imagine Teddy Roosevelt,
big stick, open-work face, clicking
teeth and all, coming to Chicago to
take charge of the shot-to-pieces po
lice department?
There is a remote possibility he
may be offered the job. Talk about
this possibility started since the elec
tion blizzard swept away the Thomp-son-Lundin
hopes of controlling the
state's attorney's office.
A rumor to this affect was floating
ground town todayt ' '
Big Bill Thompson has never had
much love for Teddy and under or
dinary conditions the last thing to
expect would be the mayor naming,
the Oyster Bay hero for Chicago po
lice chief. The gossip runs, how
ever, that some of the mayor's
shrewdest advisers say it would be
a big play for popularity to name the
new York broncho buster for the
job of loweroing the crime rate of
the Windy City.
Thompson is going to New York
