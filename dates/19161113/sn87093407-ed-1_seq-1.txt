GREATER revolution, a tremendous religi' -us revival that

If the thrilling religious events which I have just been

This almost incredible flocking of men tack to religion,

spiritual awakening in the souls of men today which may
make this an epoch in the history of religion second only

millions back to the church, and in fact may unify all Christ
