British Troops Open
I New Attack oh Both
Sides of Ancre River
If London, Nov. 13, 4:55 p. m. The British troops, in
lb their new offensive north of the Ancre river, have advanced
II ; to maximum depth of one mile, capturing from the Germans
Iff the towns of Beaumont-Hamel and Saint Pierre Divion, ac-
cording to the correspondent of Reuter's Telegram company
If. at British headquarters. Fighting is going on between the
If German and British troops around the town of Serre, about
It two miles north of Beaumont-Hamel. Two thousand pris-
II oners have been taken by the British.
. Todays announcement, oy jumaon
that the British have opened an at
: 1 tack on both sides of the Ancre river
: in northern France indicates the pos
siblity than an important new often-
t siv has begun.
i The Ancro river, or brook, approx
imately bounds on the south the sharp
j' salient made in the German lines by
j the prolonged Franco-British offensive
in the Somme region. Apparently
General Haig's troops are now attack-
ing tills salient from both sides.
In a broad sense this salient ex-
tends some IS miles northward to
I Arras, but whether the new British
I , operation covers Its entire breadth or
I an attempt is under way, merely to
crush in the southern section, is not
made plain by the official statement
''. Reports from Petrograd, so far un
; confirmed by officials advices, declare
J that Field Marshal von Mackensen is
i continuing his retreat in Dobrudja
under disastrous conditions. It is
even said that the Russians have suc
ceeded in crossing the Danube at two
point south of Tchernavoda, which if
correct would mean that von Macken
sen's army was being taken in the
-rear or thathehad been-forced back
I from the Constanza-Tchernavoda rail
f way line. His force is said to be
demoralized from reverses, heavy
Josses, disease and lack of reinforce
ments. The Black sea port of Constanza is
reported again under fire of the Rus
sian fleet.
The recent Serbian victory in Mace
t ; donia appears from the entente ac-
counts to have been a brilliant one.
Paris reports that the Germans and
Bulgarians were pushed back nearly
two miles in the Cerna river region
southeast of Monastir, in a two day
battle and that they lost 1.000 men
in prisoners. Unofficial accounts ah
; nounce an additional Serbian success
, to the north along the bend of the
river, carrying the closing-in move
ment on Monastir still further.

entente artillery was yesterday shell
ing Tchernavoda in Dobrudja from

WILSON BACK
AT HIS DESK
Prepares to Take Up Impor
tant Foreign Problems Held
in Abeyance During
Election.
NO CABINET CHANGES
Summary of Serious Affairs
Laid Before President for
Immediate Consideration.
Washington, Nov. 13. President
Wilson was back at his desk in the
White House today after an absence
of two months, prepared to take up
important foreign problems which
have been held in abeyance pending
the election. These included the
Germaii submarine situation and the
Mexican problem.
The president was expected to con
sider first the submarine situation
which is admittedly serious. A sum
mary of recent developments in Ger
man submarine warfare, prepared by
the state department, was ready to be
laid before him and, in addition, he
probably soon will confer again with
Ambassador Gerard on the situation.
The president has not oven consid
ered the question of changes in his
cabinet, according to officials, who
characterize as premature reports that
he had decided on such changes. It
is possible, however, that one or two
cabinet officers may not remain after
March 4.
No Cabinet changes.
There woor many reports circulated
regarding changes in tho cabinet, but
officials in close touch with the
president declared today that it is al
most certain that ho will urge all the
present members of tho cabinet to
remain at their posts and changes are
not expected unless members them
selves desire to quit tho official fam
ily. It is considered possible, however,
that one or moro members of tho
cabinet may resign for personal rea
sons. Seretary McAdoo has been fre
quently mentioned as one member
likely to resign and Representative
Carter Glass of Virginia, chairman of
tho house banking and currency com.
mittee, has been suggested for his
post. It was stated definitely today
that Mr. McAdoo can remain in the
president's cabinet as long as he dev
slres and It was denied that ho has
offered his resignation.
In case there is a vacancy in the
supreme court, Attorney-General
Gregory, Secretary Lane or Senator
Walsh would be considered first for
tho nppointment
Secretary Redfield, Secretary Baker
and Secretary Daniels also have been
mentioned as members of the cabinet
who might desire to quit public life,
but it was stated definitely today that
none of them had signified any such
intention.
Secretary Tumulty to Remain.
Secretary Tumulty Is also expected
to remain in his present post, al-
though he could be appointed as a
member of tho board of general ap
praisers in New York, if he desired.
Reports have connected Mr. Tumulty's
name with a cabinet position, but it
SERBIANS WIN I
BRILLIANT FIGHT I
Teutonic Allies Forced Back
Two Miles; One Thousand
Prisoners Captured.
Paris, Nov. 13. Noon. The Ser
bians have won a brilliant victory over
the Germans and Bulgarians in the
Cerna district southeast of Monastir,
the war office announced today. The
Serbians supported by French artil
lery, forced the Teutonic allies to re
tire a distance of nearly two miles
and captured about 1,000 prisoners.
The retreat of the German-Bulgarian
force was compelled after a battle
lasting two days.
The prisoners raise the total cap
turcs since September 12, says the
statement, to 6,000 men, together with jH
72 cannon and 53 machine guns taken
during this period.
was stated authoritatively today that
he will not become a cabinet officer.
Although Mr. Wilson was tired out
when he returned to the White House
last night h,e was up early today and
had breakfast before 8 o'clock. Imme
diately afterward he began reading a
huge stack of mail accumulated during
his trip to Willlamstown, Mass.
The president asked first for the
latest information in the political
make-up in the house of representa
tives in the sixty-fifth congress. He
was told indications from present re
turns were that the Republicans would
have 217 members and the Democrats
212, with six members of other par-
The president was understood to be
much concerned over "the make-up of
the next house chiefly because of its
effect on the selection of its speaker
and the chairmanships of committees
which he is anxious to see in the
hands of Democrats. As far as legls
lation is concerned, it was said today, -H
Mr. Wilson is confident that most
measures to be proposed by him would
gain the support of enough Republic
ans to carry them through.
Mr. Wilson continued to refuse to
make any comment on the election
pending the receipt of formal word
from Mr. Hughes and the Republican
national committee conceding his re
election. After a brief stay in Washington, jH
the president may go away for a rest
tiefore congress convenes. Hot Springs IH
was mentioned as the place he might jH
visit.
Important Measures Pending. 11
Because of the probability that the
next house may be Republican, the
president is laying plans to secure as
much important legislation as posslblo
during the next session opening next jH
month. Measures he particularly de
sires passed are those to allow Amerl
can exporters to establish common
selling agencies abroad, to enlarge the
Interstate Commerce Commission and
create machinery for preventing in the
future a crisis similar to that which
recently threatened to involve the
country in a railroad strike and other
railroad legislation suggested by him
when the strike threatened. JM
The president has begun prepara
tion of his next messago to congress. tM
He plans to urge that a number of SM
these questions be taken up. IH
