tho proposed nmendment makes Is
that $300,000 bonds may be issuod
for a single purpose, namely) for
building a railroad.
Tho city cannot be called on for
any further disbursement for such
purposo. All Incidental expenses In
connection with and for tho purpose
of completing the plans necessary to
the building of this road for the pity
will be borne by private subscription,
nnd it Is understood that these plans
nro well matured toward campletinn.
It Is oxpected that all preliminaries
nfter the bonds are completed will be
closed promptly and that actual
'.vcrk on the new road will be under
wny this winter.
THE VOTERS tomorrow trill My whether KteasaOi Fall, .hall remain
a one of the hMdiwi. of, ers M Am state, of Oregon, or
whether It shall this opportwuitr s4 tafeette place to the race to be
come the second city to the state.
The Herald favor the bond Issue for Use cessjtractton of. the railroad,
but cur principal rcaaon Is one digeres. from that aemsdly beard in its
favor. Instead of Increasing the tax levy, we Believe that the construc
tion of the railroad villi be the Means of events radndns; the todlvld.
ual laves of the citterns nearly one-half.
A study of die tax levies of the cKJen ef the state shows that It is the
smuH town that para the. biggest tax In KSfertiou to the total valnstlon.
Thc levy for Klamath-Falls Is comparatively htoh today, Being thirteen
mills. Klamath Falls 'lias pavement, rewers, and other nxalern conven-.
Icnccs eqnal to any other dty of its stos to tne state. Tet the town of'
Merrill, to onr own csjsmty, wtthont nny. of 4hsss eonyeniences, is paying
vrrr near as mnch. their levy for'l10 hetog twelve"nsU!;"on irwotTieT
hand, the dty of Pendleton, which is considered the second, dry In wealth
In the state, pays 0.S mills, while Fort and, which has leaned bonds for ev
ery imaginable purpose that wonld add. to the growth and development of
the city, lias a levy of 8.3 milk for IMS, nnd the levy for 1915 wns 7.5
mills. Just half the levy which the people of Klamath Falh are paying.
Umler Judicious and business-like management, the larger the dty the
less tho tax levy. The property owner In the small city usually pays the
most taxes. Madras, in Jefferson county, without s foot of pavement, lias
u levy of S5 mills, which Jacksonville, hi Jackson county, has a levy of
22 mills, which is greater than either Medford or Ashland, both of which
liure hundreds of thousands of doll m of outstanding bonds.
v We do not believe in promiscuous Issuance of bonds, and are opposed
to bond issues or large expenditures of public money, unless It can be
shotvn, as in the present Instance, that It wiH mean the growth and de
velopment of the city, and thus by Increasing the preferty value of the city
tend to reduce the tax levy-
