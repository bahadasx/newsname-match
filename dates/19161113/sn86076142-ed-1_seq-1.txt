No more credit could be given the
Tonopah football team had they won
the game from Reno on Saturday
than is due them for the plucky and
strenuous fight they put up against
big odds in holding the Reno team
to a score of but three points. It
may be said in passing that a Tono

opponent a man weighing 225. The
Tonopah boy never saw a game until
this season, being a freshman, while
the Reno man is playing at least his
third , season. Th Reno team had
the advantage of about 30 pounds

wind prevented the Tonopah team
from making use of the open plays
and forward passes "with which they
expected to win th game, the game
had to be. played ' with ' hard line
