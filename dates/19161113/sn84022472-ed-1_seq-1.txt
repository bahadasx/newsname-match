Embassy Here Thinks That

" Washington, Nov. 1 3 The German
embassy has ' reason to believe - that
a number of highly confidential offi
cial despatches, at present missing,
were in the packets from' which Karl
Armgaard Graves extracted letters he
is charged with haying used-fn an al
leged attempt to obtain 3,000, from
Countess Von Bernstorff, wife of the
German" ambassador. ;
. The. nature of the despatches is un
known. The German government
has- been sent all-available informa
tion; regarding the packet's . contents
and investigation, it is expected, will
Immediately be made in Berlin with a
yjew of ascertaining what, If any, se
cret papers are missing, as well as
the Identity of the messenger from
whom Graves secured the letters.
It was made clear today that
Prince LHatzfeldt, counsellor of the
embassy, through .whom Graves at
tempted te get the $3,000, may testify
against him but would prefer not to.
If, bis testimony is deemed essential
to the prosecution' of Graves, permis
sion for. hint to appear in court will
be asked of Emperor William.
- It was learned today that the pack
et trom which Graves obtained the
letters addressed to Countess Van
Bernstorff had been officially settled
by the German foreign office. The
letters ' which have so far been - seen
by embassy officials are dated early In
September. , It is presumed that they
were started, on their way to the
United Slates from-Berlin between the
10th and 15th of that month.

Graves last night' in New York were
