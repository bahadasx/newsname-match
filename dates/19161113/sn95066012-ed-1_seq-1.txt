London, Nov. 12. Russians and Ru
manians on both the Dobruja and
Translyvanian fronts of the Rumanian
theatre are vigorously on the offensive
against the troops of the Teutonic al

railway, begun last week, the Russo
Rumanian forces have pushed back
Field Marshal von. Mackensen's men
to' a front running through, the towns

road id the Somme
region of France, has at last fallen
entirely Into the hands of the troops
of General Foch. .In tho capture of the
town the French inflicted heavy ca
sualties on the Germans and captured
seven officers, 220 men and eight ma
chine guns. On the remainder of the
front in France artillery duels are in
progress.
Fighting throughout the night the
French conquered house after house,
their advance being vigorously contest
ed. The last fragment of the village
to be won was the eastern ridge. Here
the Germans made their final stand
with rifles and machine guns.
The war office at Paris reports the
German losses in dead as extraordi
narily heavy. A projected French at
tack near Ablalncourt, south of the
Somme, was broken up by the German
artillery fire, Berlin reports today. At
other points on the western front, on
ly artillery cannonading marked the
day. British headquarters reports
launching gas attacks north of the
Ancre.

theatres. Along the Nara
yuxka river In Gellcla attacks by the
Russians have been put down by the
Austro-Germans. The town of Polog

GREENE TALKS TO

Discusses Social and Political Life
in Washington
LAWMAKERS JUST WOFKERS
Transaction of the Nation's Business
is Like Any Other
Occupation.
An unusually large audience greeted
Congressman Frank L. Greene at the
meeting of the Fornightly held at
the Second Congregational chapel Sat
urday afternoon at 3 o'clock. The re
poit of the last meeting was given and
12 new members voted into member
ship. Announcement was made that Miss
Vossler would resume the Fortnightly
Recreation club if the club so desired.
Any one wishing to Join the class was
asked to notify Mrs. Frank F. Howe
during the coining week as arrange
ments must be made very soon in or
der that Miss Vossler may complete
her winter schedule. The program
opened with the singing of two songs
composed by Brohlns and sung by
Miss Vera Suter, accompanied by Mrs.
A. W. Varney. Miss Suter Is always
a favorite with the club and her selec
tions were particularly pleasing, "1
Would I Knew Where Lies the Path,"
and "We Walked One Day."
Congressman Greene was then in
troduced and spoke informally for an
hour on some phases ot the social and
political life at Washington.
He explained wherein the social life
at the capital differs lrom that of nay
of our other large cities much of the
official eoclety being brilliant and
spectacular though largely a matter
of form and courtesy rather than the
association of congenial elements.
Mr. Greene also wished to make it
clear that the men who are making
history each day at Washington are
not perhaps the Imposing and digni
fied statesmen of our imagination hut
plain hard working men who go about
their tasks each day in much the same
manner as men in other walks of life.
Tho works of our national congress
has become so much enlarged that
noccfsarily each member must speci
alize along some particular line und
ho is assigned to the committee where
he can do his best work. The after
noon was an enjoyable one. The next
meeting will be held on November
25th the subject being "The Schools
of Today and Tomorrow."
TORRICELLI'S VACUUM.
Experiment That Led to the Invention
of the Barometer.
The barometer was Invented by Tor
ricelll, a pupil of Galilei, in 1GI3. In
attempting to pump water from n very
deep well near Florence be found that
in spite of all bis efforts the liquid
would not rise higher la tho pump
stock than thirty-two feet.
This set the young scientist to think
ing, and as he could not account for tho
phenomenon in any other way he was
not slow in attributing it to atmos
pheric pressure. He argued that water
would rise In a vacuum only to such a
height ns would render tho downward
pressure or weight of the column of
water Just cqunl to the atmospheric
pressure and, further, that should a
heavier fluid be used the height of the.
column could be much reduced.
To prove this be selected a glass tube
four feet long and after scaling one
end filled it with mercury and then in
verted it lit a basin containing a quan
tity of the same peculiar liquid. The
column In the tube quickly fell to a
height of nearly thirty inches above
tho mercury in the basin, leaving in
the top of the tubo a vacuum which is
the most perfect that has ver been
obtained and which is to this day call
ed the Torrlcelli vacuum in honor of
its discoverer.
The name of tho Instrument means
"weight or pressure measure," and its
fundamental principles cannot be bet
ter illustrated than by the above de
scribed experiment.

U-BOAT SANK COLUMBIAN
Submarino Commander Waited Until
Storm Abated.
Paris. Nov. 12. A wireless dispatch
from Madrid says it was a German
submarine which sank the American
steamship Columbian: -
According to this information, the
Columbian encountered the submarine
November 6, during a violent tempest.
The submarine compelled the Colum
bian to Interrupt its voyage and lie to
under surveillance 'until November 8.
When the stormcsnbsided, the dis
patch says, the submarine ordered the
crew to abandon the ship and then
sank It.
A Havas dispatch lrom Madrid
el notes the newspapers of Corunna,
Spain, where the crew is reported to
have landed, to the effect that when
the Columbian was held uu the sub
marine ordered the crew to disem
bark, but that the . storm was bo
severe that this was Impossible until
two days later.

Capitals We Have Had.
It Is asserted sometimes that the
United States has b.id rive capitals,
but the statement Is not correc t. The
L'u it ed States ban bad but three cap
italsNew York, Philadelphia and
Washington. In the period preceding
the adoption of the constitution no
place was legally constituted a capital.
In a loose nnd unotbVial sense It Is pas
sible to describe as a capital any city
which wns ,the scut of government.
Taking the sessions of the Continental
congress as establishing a seat of gov
ernment in the Revolution and the
confederation, the following cities
may loosely rank as capitals: Phila
delphia, Baltimore, Lancaster. York.
Princeton, Annapolis, Trenton and
New York. The articles of confedera
tion were passed by congress In Phil
adelphia, and the federal convention
charged to prepare a constitution con
vened at the same place.

VISITS NEW HATCHERY
Commissioner J. W. Titcomb Inspects
Sub Station In Bushnell District
State Fish and Game Commissioner
John W. Titcomb of Lyndonville was
In the village Sunday afternoon, arriv
ing on the flyer from Pennsylvania
where he had been on a business trip
and whero he visited some of the state
and private commercial hatcheries.
Accompanied by County Game War
den E. S. Hlgglns, the commissioner
visited the new Bennington county
sub hatchery in the Bushnell district
and expressed himself as much
pleased with the natural conditions
and the work that has been accom
plished by the warden.
The hatchery is now ready for busi
ness. The building which -was used
in testing "Duck pond" springs in Ar
lington last winter was moved several
months ago and has been relocated,
the water from the big springs has
been piped to the building and the
troughs have been set up and painted.
. It is the intention of the commis
sioner to hatch a half a million trout
eggs at the station during the coming
winter. The larger portion of the
eggs will be purchased of some one of
the commercial hatcheries, probably
the big plant at Plymouth, Mass. Of
the fry hatched in the early spring as
many as possible will be raised to
the fingerling stage before being dis
tributed in the streams. The eggs
will be received some time in Decem
be. Commissioner Titcomb stated that
the water supply at the new hatchery
Is one of the best in the country for
hatchery purposes. In his opinion the
facilities available, the water supply
from the springs, a small brook and
the South stream, would permit the
raising of a million flngerlings a year
If it were thought advisable to develop
the property to such proportions. The
commissioner left this morning for his
home in Lyndonville.

The business and property of tho
Cooper Manufacturing company was
on Saturday transferred to the new

James E. Burke is one of the direc
tors. They will manage the business
for the present the same as in the
past, but will have the assistance of a
Cast enginner and efficiency expert
who is to come here from Kenosha.
The big mill at Kenosha is a hos

him into wagering ten dollars on' Wil
son. On Wednesday morning the
Democrat, believing in punctuality,
sent the Republican a check for ten
dollars. The next day, however,
when the tide began to turn towards
Wilson, the check was returned, with
another check for the same amount,
made out to the order of the Democrat
and these verses accompanied it:
Check returned which I received
To settle returns on Election eve;
Why my choice was Hughes
I cannot tell;
For we all know Pop Wilson
Kept us out of Hell.
I am at peace of mind with all men
