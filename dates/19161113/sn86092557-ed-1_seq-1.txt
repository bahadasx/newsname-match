Plans for tlic opening of a night
school In connection with the Ideal
High school arc rapidly materializing,
and should the demand for such a
school be sufficient It now seems probable
that such a school will be opened
probably the first week in December.
Superintendent Otis G. Wilson, of the
city schools, and Principal G. P. Colebank.
of ihc Fairmont High school, are
conferring with the Board of Education.
relative to establishing such a
school and if the plans appear to lie
feasible the school .vill become a reality.
The school should it become a real
ity, will be conducted for the benefit
of persons from the age of IS to (15,
who arc employed during ihc day and
unable to attend school and who desire
to better equip themselves for the
places they occupy In the business
world or to secure better and higher
positions.
The plans as they now exist are to
have the classes meet probably lliree
evenings in each week and to be eonducted
from seven to nine o'clock
Such branches are to be taught as
bookkeeping, penmanship, mechanical
ornwing. beginning and advanced
tinspta in aunuiKi nui$iiivij, ?um ?:oun*
fug. business English. business spelling.
business arithmetic, salesmanship,
English for foreigners, r.rnl citizenship

If the demand will justify it. cooking
classes will be formed in which a

will be given for housewives. Classc-;
in music, with the object of organizing
an orchestra or men's glee club will
bo given, the latter under the direction
of Miss Ethel M. Horseman, the

Should the plat s materialize for this

Republicans Want to Shear
the New Governor of
Power.
(Fpc-Ial Dispatch lo West Vlrgininnl
CHARLESTON, W. Va.. Nov. IS.?
i Hundreds of Republicans throughout
the state, alarmed by threats of Democratic
loaders to oust all Republican
j state officials as were elected in last
i Tuesday's election, in case it is shown
| Cornwell Is elected governor, are communicating
with Governor Hatfield
! and insisting that he convene the leg
I .U>U?H>? to <.AUnuiuiiiUI t ncooiuil lu |
, change the law before it 1b too late, j
Nearly a hundred Republicans have
gathered here, many of them membern ,
of the present legislature and all agree j
that an extraordinary session is nee-1
; essary if those Republicans arc to be |
allowed to hold the. office to which I
i the people of the state elected them. |
1 It is admitted that in case Cornweli |
is elected the Democrats will have
! power to oust the other state officials!
! elected. Contests need not he enter-1
j ed until after Cornwell's inauguration
! and then ho would have the power of
; appointing the third member of a spe-!
clal court which would decide the con-1
; tests and from that decision there
j would be no appeal. If the law is to [
; be amended it must be done prior to
: December first, as the old legislature;
j goes out of office on that date and in:
the new legislature that House will I
be Democratic.
In case the legislature is convened|
' it Is likely that steps will be taken
' to shear the governor of much of his:
power, because of Cornwell's boast s'
that lie will remove Republican appointees
wliose terms linve not expired.
Tills can be done by giving J
i the appointing power to tile Hoard of!
l'ublic Works instead of the*Gover-j
nor and a precedent lias been estab-i
llshecl for tliis by the Democrats. In |
I IS?:! after Governor Jacobs had been
I elected as an independent candidate.:
a Democratic legislature fearing that |
he would appoint some Republicans
i to office, e nacted a law taking all the
1 appointing power from the governor j
and vesting it in the Hoard of Public
Works. The Republicans therefore
feel justified in shearing the governot
ot nis appointing power under the circumstances.
