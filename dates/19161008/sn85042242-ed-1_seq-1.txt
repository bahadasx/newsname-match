8hore Hits Slump.
Shore, however, could not control
the ball asi he had done earlier in the
game and hit Cutshaw. Mowrey
arose to the occasion with a bounder,
which Janvrin could not handle and
Stengel and Wheat crossed the plate,
while the Boston fans began to move
uneasily in their seats. Their fears
grew when Olson beat out an infield
hit and they were scarcely relieved
when Chief Meyers fouled out. Mer­
kle, batting for Pfeffer outwitted
Shore and walked, forcing in Cut
shaw with the third run of the in­
ning. There was not a sound from
the thousands when Manager Carri­
gan ordered Shore from the box and
substituted Mays. Meyers, Brooklyn
lead off batter, scratched an infield
hit, scoring Mowrey, and the Nation­
als were within one run of'tielng the
score with the bases still loaded.
Daubert came to the plate for the
second, time in the inning. The cap­
tain hit an ugly bounder to the short­
stop, which the latter speared, and
without pausing to look whipped it
to Hobl'tzei. Daubert, sliding into
the bag head first, appeared to ar­
rive with the flashing ball, but there
was a great cheer when Umpire
O'Day, who fairly overhung the base,
signaled the third out and the ending
of the game.
Hooper Is Individual Star.
It was a climax that showed the
resources and strength of Boston
when under pressure, but it was not
the only exhibition of a similar na­
ture. Right flelder Harry Hooper un­
covered the star individual play of
the day, in the fourth session when
he made a great running catch off
Cutshaw's twisting fly, and nipped
Wheat trying to score from third.
Hooper had to sprint well over to­
ward the foul line, just back of first
base, before he could get his hands
on the ball. The effort caused him
to slip to a sitting position, but he
was up like a flash, and hurled the
ball straight as a bullet at Cady. The
latter slammed it on Wheat's ankle
as he reached for the plate at the end
of a perfect hook slide.

ed a gathering of baseball followers

$76,489.50.

Mrs. Childe Dorr Says Nominee
Has Always Upheld Labor
Class
HE WILL AID THEM IF
ELECTED 8HE CLAIMS
Minneapolis, Oct. 7.—Miss Childe
Dorr, author, one of the party of wom­
en campaigning the country in the
interest of Charles E. Hughes, who
arrived in the city today, described
Mr. Hughes as a friend of the work*
ingman, in her address at the Audi*
torium tonight.
One-third of the labor laws now on
New York's statute books, Miss Dorr
credited to Mr. Hughes as Governor
of New York. The New York work­
men's compensation act, the first in
the country, was adopted under the
pressure of Mr. Hughes insistence in
labor's behalf. Should he become
president, his influence will be exert­
ed in passing similar laws in those
states that have so far failed to adopt
its principles, she said.
Each of the fifteen speakers has
averaged eight addresses a day, some
more. These were mostly audiorium
addresses and in addition were inter­
views, platform talks, and discussions
that are part of the day's work of the
campaigners.
There were 25 pas«engers on the
train, which arrived over the Rock
Island Road.
"Those who say this is a palatial
train financed by millionaires, are
talking foolishly," said Miss Antin
yho wrote, "The Promised ILand,"
and who was born and reared in a
Jewish pale in a Russian city.
"It was financed by popular sub­
scription by women. I put in $1.00
myself. We are working hard and
enjoying it. We have one maid to
all of us women.
'1 think we are winning votes for
Hughes. It seems as if I could just
hear them dropping into the ballot
box after some of our women have
finished talking. The crowds have
been whatever the meeting places
could accommodate.
"When anyone of us do not speak
five times per day we think we are
loafing. We haven't had time to
change skirts or waists since leaving
New York."
A reception committee of fifty Min­
neapolis and St. Paul women met the
train at the depot.
GOOD LAND SALE.
F. E. Young reports the sales of
two half-sections and five quarters
during the past week. Two of these
sales were made to farmers from a

TEUTONS LOSE GROUND
IN DOBRUDJA REGION
London, Oct. 7.—British and French
have again joined forces in an extend­
ed attack against the German lines on
the Somme front. The British atack
ed from the Albert-Bapaume road,
while the French attack was along the
line of the Peronne-Bapaume road.
Gains ranging from a quarter of
a mile to two-thirds of a mile were
made and the Anglo-French front was
considerably straightened out.
The British captured the village of
Sars, which lies about a mile and a
half northeast of .Courcelette, while
the French, acording to the war office
communication, brilliantly attained
all their objectives.
Invaders Give Ground.
Entente Allied forces are pressing
hard upon the Teutonic and Bulgar­
ian troops defending occupied terri­
tory in the Balkans. Both in Mace­
donia and Dobrudja the invaders have
been compelled to give ground.
On a front of ten miles, northeast
and east of the Struma river, British
troops have ocupied live villages and
have repulsed a Bulgarian attack. Fur­
ther west, on the (Macedonian front,
in the region of the Cerna river, the
Serbian troops have rebouched from
the Kaimakcalan plateau, and advance
attachments have reached the Blea
Ovda river.
Italian Troops Advance.
French troops have occupied the
town of German, on the eastern shore
of Lake Presba, near the western end
of the Entente, line. In the region of
Lake Butkova, Italian troops have ad­
vanced.
Germans Lese Near Dobrudja.
Russian and Roumanian. fot£QB have
taken ground from the troops of Field
Marshal von Mackensen in Dobrudja.
The Russians have occupied two vill­
ages and repelled attacks. Advancing
on the right flank, the Roumanians
have occupied some trenches.
Another unconfirmed wireless mes­
sage from Rome, received in London,
says that another Roumanian expedi­
tion is reported to have crossed the
Danube into Bulgaria, apparently be­
hind Field Marshal Ton Mackensen's
line.

Japan will be more disposed than

Page Leaders'
Union- -Horses
Scabbing Job
Hey, boy, page the secretary of the
teamsters' union!
There is a clear case of "scabbing"
on the Hanlon ft Okes paving job.
And the "scabs" are horses.
When the concrete mixing plant was
first set up between Thayer and Broad­
way on Third street, a boy or man
was attached to each concrete cart,
whose duty it waB to lead the pati­
ent animal, who supplied the motive
power. The job didn't look particular­
ly difficult, but it did seem, to the
average spectator, necessary.
Horses Pilot Themselves.
Yesterday tho scene changed. The
leaders had disappeared, and the
horses were doing their own piloting.
Labor is scarce, so scarce that the
paving contractors have been bard
pushed to find enough men to feed
their mixer and spread the mud after
it is mixed. They decided they could
not spare a pilot to each horse. They
consulted the horses, who agreed to
tackle the job unassisted, and the
lead strings were removed, and the
leaders Bet to work at more useful
jobs.
Beasties Know Thsir Business
All day long the intelligent beasties
trudged up and down Third street,
bracing back in the traces against
their load going down, and buckling
into their collars with the empty car
on the upgrade trip. The horses seem­
ed to enjoy the comparative freedom,
casting their eyes independently from
side to side as they tramped up and
down. The spectators enjoyed it, too,
and undoubtedly, Hanlon & Okes, who
have reduced the labor in this depart­
ment by three, are not dissatisfied.
In the interests of strict justice, it
is presumed that the good horses are
getting at least time and a half in
their oa?.s envelope.

DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN
ACCURATE INFORMATION
Long Branch, N. J., Oct. 7.—Return­
ing from his first invasion of the Mid­
dle West since the campaign opened,
President Wilson tola/ appealed to
independent voters to support the
democratic party in November, on
the ground that It presents a united
front for the passage of progressive
legislation, while the republican party
is made up of discordant elements
which can accomplish nothing.
Criticising the "old guards" of the
republican party, the President, by
inference, attacked both Charles E.
Hughes and Theodore Roosevelt, and
declared that while every line of hla
national policy has been assailed, "no
diagrams have been drawen of any
other."
Mr. Wilson charged that the "old
guard" was in control of the last re­
publican convention and "made all
the choices that were made by that
convention."
The President spoke to a delega­
tion of Progressives, Independents,
and College men, who came in a pri­
vate train and marched to Shadow
Lawn with a band playing popular
music, while they sang tho song:
"He kept us out of war."
Mr. Wilson was introduced by Pro­
fessor Irving Fisher of Yale, a mem­
ber of the Roosevelt Conservation
Commission, and Hugh Gorden Miller,
a New York Progressive.

ATLANTIC IN 17 DAYS
Newport News, R. I., Oct. 7.—Seventeen days from Wilhelm
shaven, the Imperial German submarine U-53, dropped anchor in
Newport Harbor today.
Almost before the officials of the American fleet of warships
through which the stranger had nosed her way, had recovered
from their astonishment, the undersea fighter had delivered a
message for the German ambassador and weighing anchor disap­
peared beneath the waves just inside the three mile limit.
Ready for Fight
Ais she came and went, she flew the black and white colors of
the German navy, a gun was mounted on the forward deck and
another aft, while eight torpedoes plainly visible under the deck
gave mute assurance that the warship was ready for a fight.
