FOREST FIRES IN
ARIZONA ARE
ABOUT OVER
WITH
DEPARTMENT ISSUES REPORT
OF FIRES DURING
PAST SEASON
REMARKABLR GOOD RECORD AS
COMPAED WITH OTHER
ocnouns
The reports which hae been sent
in to District headquarters of the For
est Sen ice for Arizona and New Mex
ico indicate that the Forest fire sea
son is practically closed for this year
in the two states In ordinary sea
sons there is but little danger of bad
forets fires i" the fall of the year,
with the exception of the extreme
northern forests of New Mexico
The record cf having extlngull-j
o'Q fires successfully, with the keep-in-
of 343 of these, or over 50 per
cent, to less than a quarter of an acre
in size Indicates the effectiveness with
wh.ch the forest firemen worked.
. . 'the total area co ered by fire was
a 'rifle over 30.000 acres, or an aver
age Of less than 50 acres per fire
The Coconino Forest, near Flagstag,
had 185 fires, or about one-third of
the total of this service district.
However, the total area burned by
the6e fires abounted to only 350
acres.
The other fifteen forests had num
bers of fires running from 56 down
to 6, which was the number reported
from the Chlricahua In southeatsem
Arizona
The Coconino Forest, near Flagstaff
these fires were cansed by human
agencies and were clearly preventable
Indicates that with greater care In
the use cf fire by the public In the
forests, the annual loss could be re
duced still further.
SPEEDING GAR KNOCKS
ANOTHER OFF GRADE
NEAR GLOBE
GLOBE. Oct. 6 Six lives were
placed in jeopardy early this morn
ing through the criminal carelessness
of an unidentified speeder, who knock
ed a service car containing five pas
sengers from the Globe-Miami road.
The wreck occurred near the Stan
dard oil tanks in lower IMamL
William Lacey, driving a car for
tie Smith stage line, waa returning to
the city with four young ladiea whose
names could not be learned, and
Prof. Bond, a local musician, when an
automobile, tearing along at a ter
rific speed, struck the service car.The
latter machine was knocked off the
embankment and rolled completely
over.
All of the occupants sustained min
or bruises, one of the fair passengers
losing a tooth. A valuable violin be
longing to Prof. Band was reported
crushed and ruined. The car is al
most a total loss, the body being bad
ly smashed beyond all hope of repair.
An earnest effort Is to be made by
the authorities to learn the Identity
of the driver of the ear whose wanton
recklessness endangered the Uvea of
the party. In the event that the of
ficer are successful, a criminal
charge will probably be lodged against
the operator.

GETTING SHORT
ON CASH
PHOENLX, Oct. 7 Although the
tate of Arizona has on hand a cash
balance of $76442.45. unless bome of
the funds are speedily increased,
there is going to be a deficit therein
The report of the State Treasurer
Mlt SImms for the month of Sep
tember, Just prepared, show s that dur
ing that month a total of $32,110 51
was taken in, and a total of $86,400.-
36 spent.
Some of the funds are so badl de
pleted, that in 6eieti cases they ap
pear in name onlj, the amount op
posite being less than a dollar. Fur
instance, the University of Arizona
has a credit of ninety seven cents v.-'th
the treasurer. This might buy a box
cf very cheap cigars for the maculty,
liu' it would not go very far toward
fitting out a chemical laboratory.
Colonel Harris is equally as poor.
In bis. military fund there Is a tout
i 7.S.' remaining, ,-out enough to
buy a rifle and a pair of leggings
The general fund has a balance of
440 61. and in comparison is as b"dly
deplf'-d as the rest of the funds.
fctre is nothing alarming in this
state of affairs, at. there is a reason
able belief prevalent at the state
house that the funds will be raised
to their proper amounts within a few
days, as money is paid to the state.
SHORT COURSE FOR ARI
ZONA MINERS AT U.
OF A. THIS "YEAR
The Short Course for Miners at
the University of Arizona starts on
October 30th. Last year the short
course, was initiated upon a new
plan two weeks were devoted to
every subject given, each subject re
lating directly to the one preceding
and following it. Thin year the ar
rangement will be somewhat differ
ent; last year the first six weeks were
devoted to blowpipe analysis, miner
alogy and elementary geology, and it
was found that almost all students at
tended the three courses Hence, this
year from October 30th to December
2 these three subjects will be given
simultaneously. The same applies to
field geology, assaying and metallurgy
courses, the flotation and the miners'
courses.
The object ot these courses Is to
give the working men of the state an
opportunity of attending the univer
sity for a short period, in order to
get in concentrated form information
and training that will enable them
to better their on positions. To many
o; these men practical Knowledge has
formed the major part of their edu
cation, while the fundamental princi
ples on which their practical work de
pends is unknown to them. Because
a man knows minerals is precisely
the reason why he should take a
course in mineralogy. Many of our
prospectors know much geology, but
it is surprising what the past has re
vealed in the short course in geology.
The University IB oiganlzed to reach
the people and to serve the people,
and the short course is one of its
many ways of doing so.
OLD TIMER DIES.

STATE OF
MEXICAN ISMUR
DERED IN TOMB
STONE LAST
NIGHT
SHOT IN BACK AND DIED IN-
STANTLY; BELIEVED RIGHT
MAN IS ARRESTED
MEXICANS GET MUCH BOOZE AND
CREATE DISTURBANCE;
OFFICERS BUSR
A murder and many drunken Mex
icans was the result of payday night
last night, with the result that the
man, supposed to have done the kiil-
'mg, lies in the county jail, and a doz
en more held as accomplices and wit
nesses. Last night was a bad one for this
city in the way of Intoxicated Mexl
uns, both the city and county offi
cers hating bem kept up all night
dispersing crowdg ranging all the way
from five to twenty men, all drunk.
Sheriff Harry Wheeler, Deputy A.
W. Howe, and Chief of Police George
jiravin and Nlghtwatchman Hal Smith
were kept busy up until 12:30 break
ing up drunken crowds, and had just
broken up a mob of about twenty-five
on Fremont street, starting them to
ward the Mexican quarter of the city
and Sheriff Wheeler, Deputy Howe
and Chief of Police Bravin had gone
to their homes, anticipating no fur
ther trouble. This was about 1 a, m.
and the officers had no sooner gotten
to their homeg when two shots rang
out, followed by yells.
Sheriff Wheeler started on a run
for the scene, about two blocks north
from his home, and Chief Bravin,
who was just retiring, hurriedly dres
sed, also started in the direction of
ho shots.
The officers were soon joined by
Vightwatchman Smith, and later by
)eputy Sheriff Howe from the central
part of the city.
Sheriff Wheeler was the first to ar
rive and intercepted a Mexican on his
way to call Chief Bravin, and who
gave the sheriff the direction where
the shooting had occured.
Running to the scene the sheriff
saw a man running toward the gulch
and upon reaching a fence he stopped
and was placed under arrest. He
gave his name as Herclona, Ortiz. The
sheriff and prisoner then returned to
the scene where the victim, Ramon
Morales, was lying, where they Joined
the other officers.
Ortiz was identified by the wife ot
Morales as the man who did the
shooting. The woman said that the
balance of the crowd dispersed after
the first shot, Ortiz remaining behind
and firing the second shot.
He was taken to the county jail by
S em. Wheeler, and the officers Im
mediately combed the entire vicinity
of the shooting, rounding up some
seven or eight Mexicans, and were all
placed in jail. They will be given a
hearing Monday, when they will have
sobored up, and it U the firm belief
of the officers that they have the right
man who did the shooting. Morales
was just returning home from, the
night shift at one of the local mines,
and was not one of the gang, and it
is believed that those who did the
shooting were lying in wait for him.
He was
shot in the small of the
back, the bullet tearing out his en
trails, and he died almost lntav!ly.
It is believed that the nfafdor nas a
deeper plot than appears on the sur
face, and the officers are busy hunt
ing up clues that will bring out the
fact In the
