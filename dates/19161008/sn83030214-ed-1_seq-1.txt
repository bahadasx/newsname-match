BORDEN'S BRINGS
200 COWS HERE
Experiment Being Made to
Cut Cost of Milk
Production.
Pooghkaaaaifl, N. V.. Oct. 7. Twa
hundred cows will be sent to New York j
City this week for experimentation on
the co;-:t of milk production under new j
methods H. N. Hallock, vico-pre.-idcnt
of the Horden's Condensed Milk Com?
pany, announced here to-night. It ia ;
expected that the co44s will be stabled
at the company's Ftation in Flush-:
ing. L I.
"Perhaps our experiments will show.
that the farmer's BBflthfld of producitif:
milk is uneconomic." Mr. Hallock ssid. '
"We have heard much in thl laat 441%
about the hardships of thl milk pro?
ducers. Certain investigat mns earried
on by Borden's indieate that turn%g
cows out to pasturnge may not bo the
bc.-.t way to make high gride milk.
S1I0 leeds for (owa,
"In our New Vork experiments we
propose to feed the eawi from silos.
They will not get any pasturage. If
we Iind that milk can be produeod
eeonomually by bnnging cows to the
city, this Inforaiation 44,11 be of value
in working out the great problem of
thc milk induEtry. B* transporting the
cows to the city the cost of hauling
rnilk many miles in rcfrigerator cars
would bc eliminated.
"All our ideas on this matter are in
thc expenmental stagc. We do not ex?
pect that the milk produced from 200
cows will have any effect on the pres?
ent ahortage due to the disputo be?
tween large distributers and the Dairy?
men's League."
There is no ob.iection from the point
of view of public health to bnnging
cowb within the city lirnits, Commis
osioner Haven Kmeraon of the Health
Department said last night, aa long as
the flWBflll comply with the NgBjatliBI

Moves Forward.
London, Oct. 7.--The Allies renewed
tlic.r great offensive in Picardy to-day .
In a perfectly coorilii:ated attack the
British and French troops ewept for?
ward along a front oi" ten miles from ;
the Albert-Bapaume road to the region
south of Beachave
Haig'.a troops carried the village of
Le Sars, less than four miles southwest
of Bapaume. on the bighway from Al?
bert, and advanced their lines from'
600 to 1,000 yards between (,'ueudecourt
and Leabeeafa The French swung for?
ward two-thirds of a mile northeast of
Morval, seized the whole of the Bethune
?road to within 'J00 yards of Bailly and
brought their line to the westcrn
iringe* of the St. Pierre Vaa.-t Wood.
Thus alotig the two-mile front aouth of
Bailly the French advanced at least
half a mile at every point.
Hold Key to Bapaume.
These gains represent extremely im*
joitar.t ateps ia the Allied movement
against Bapaume and Peronne, directed
along the two roads running into the
forrner stronghold from the. southwest
and the southwest. By the seizure of
le Sars and ground on both sides of ii
the British have removed the Iast ob
stacle to a quick drive on Bapaume
r.long the Albert road. That position
is now withm range of the heavy
1'ntish guns.
The French advance has brought
them ifl position to strike the vital
blow at Meat Bt. Quentin and Peronne,
rr.d to sweep the Bethune road as far
north as Transloy. The wedgc Foch'a
traapa have been driving between Ba?
paume and Peronne ha" been extended
until its tla now protrudes into the
enemy'* front directly north of Mont I
St. Quentin, the key to P.-ronne. A

pei tneir ri'tirement from that sector
I'rowning the wc.-tern slopes of the
Sailly-SallUael ridge, the French line
now dominates the region on all sides.
With the fall of Bailly which cannot
hold out many hours longir the
French will come into posscssion of the
strctch of tho Bethune road south of
Transloy, thus bringing their lines on
a level with those of the Bri'.ish at
Gueilecourt.
The Allied line from le Sars to the
Bethune road represents the base of

: r rr. ih? T'lburte Ba.-rat, )
\>. a biagtoB, t?ct. 7. VWaihiagtaa
jraspeil uhen news came of thc arrival
ot the V-o'l at Newport to-day and
had not recovered its breath before
the submarine departed. Th-1 inter
val, however, Wfll full of aeiie'..
Sir Cecil Spring-Rice rushed to the
State Department and held a hurried
conference with Acting Secretary Polk.
The German Ambassador, Count ton
Berristorff. got word about the same
time and prepared to nend a delepa
tion from thl embafsy ti greet the'
U-boat'n commander and 7*ive him a
Meh flf important dllflatehfll for tiie j
Foreign Oflice that had been held ready
for the long awaited commercial sub-'
marine Bremen.
State, Navy snd Treasury officials
conferred ha.'.ily on measures for
prateetiag the neutrality of the I'nited
StBtes.
All this went for nothing. Word
aaJBfl that the submarine had left, and |
cfficials sighed their relief.
Rernatorff Seemfl Surprised.
Count von Bernstorff was apparently
Af rnuch surpri.ed as anybody. He had
ro warning that any war tubmarine
was on the way, he said, and he could
hr./ard no guess as to the contents of
thl letter whieh the commander is
aid to have brought for him.
While the flying visit of the stibma
rine was the main topic of discussion
among navy officers to-night, it was
her prohahle miision on the American
coa.-t whieh interested them rather
than her mee-hanical featurei or how
her trip froifl Germany might affect
naval warfare in general.
Douht Actisity Here.
The distance covered by the subma?
rine from Wllhelaiihavin la well within
the eruising radius flf much smaller
vmill than the U-53, including some
of the older craft flf the American navy.
Howevir, it il bflliflTfld that even thc
lug C boats, whieh journeyed from the
North Sea to the Mediterranean and
baek long ago, could BOt carry IBflBgB
fuel oil for ? round trip across the At?
lantic, as well as for eruising duty on
this side. For this reason, many ofri
cr appeared to believe that the pur
?Ofll of the trip flf the U-M might have
been more to give a denionstration of
the possibilities of Bubmarine warfare
than actually to lie in 4vait for British
rn- Canadian flflflflflll plying acroas tha
Atlantic.
The merchant submarine Deutsch
laad crossed the Atlantic- and re
turned, but it is laaliied that the ap
pearance of an armed naval under
watcr boat will create a inuch more
profound impression, particularly on
the public mind in this country.
CruinerV Needa I.arge.
It was expected that the visit would
revive immediatcly rumors of a Ger
mm submarine base on the North
Atlantic coast and of aecret radio
st.ations maintained along the Amer
iran coast line by German interests.
For a submarine patrol off American
or Canadian port.s provision would
linve to be made to supply fuel, tor
pedoes and food supplies. The aver
?ge submarine carries not more than
ten or twelve torpedoes, and, liBifl
the ehances are that aeveral of these
would be tired for every hit recorded,
it would seem necessary that a re?
serve supply be kept close at hand.
A majority of the officers around the
Navy Department to-night seemed to
thin i it likely that the l'-5:i had been
sent over either as a convoy for a
slower merchant aubniarinr. or with
the idea of threatening Canadian trar.s
ports and ammunition ships sailing
from American ports.
Britiah Made Trip First.
The first transatlantic aubmarine
boat journi y 4v?s made by British
lighting craft sim.lar to the American
Navy's Il-Upe boats, ten of whieh were
constructed iri fanada by an American
tirm. OaM flf the tent went from the
i Canadian coast to Glbraltar without
stopping her engines, and all of the ten
arrived at their Kuropean destinationa
without accident. It 13 understood,
however, that theae boats were accom
panied by surface craft carrying extra
supplies and fuel. This make.s the leat
i of the Deutschland, whieh made her
I round trip from Bremen to Ballimore
! without a tender and despite the pres
I ence of hostile cruisers on the seas.
the tirst really epectacular cruisc of
, th" kind.
Navy construrtors. however, have
; never doubted the ability flf Germany's
big war submarines to make the tt.p,
since they have greater speed. gr.'ater
fuel capacity and lesa dead \? eight to
carry than had the Deutschland, whieh

PEACE PLEA FAVORS
NO PARTY, SAYS POPE
Rome, Ocl. 7. Pope Benedict.
in a letter to t'ardinal von Hart
mann. Archbishop of lolognr, and
other (jerm.in archbishops, laincnts
that his invitation in behalf of
peaee has given nsr to suspicion
on one sidr and open offertce on
the othrr, as though, instead of
hcuiK dictated hy an ardent ..Vsire
to settle thr quarrrl justly and
rightly, it had been dictated by
the hopc of sccuring advantage to

The Pontiff adds that perturba
tion of spirit has prevented normal
judgment and the recognition of
thr truth. so that what to many is
self-evident becomes obscure ?
namely, that "the Pontiff. the
Vicar of the King of Peaee and the
Father of all Christians, in c.onse

SABIN REPEATS
PEACE STORY
Denies Naming Gerard
as Bearerof Kaiser's
Message.
a
Charlei H. Sabin, piesiden' of the
Guaranty Trui'.t Company, was revealed
yesterdav as the man who set afoot th*
report that Ambassador Gerard is
briniring peaee proposals here from
Germany.
After a long cross-examination by
reporter' on the Southampton golf
links yeaUiaay, Mr. Sabin repeated his
aaaertlafl that peRce proposals were on
the way from Germany. He insisted
that the Administration knew of these
propo;als, denied he mentioned Am
Iassador Gerard as the bearer and re?
fused any details.
It became known thal Mr. Sabin. who
bnd been on his vacation, came to
town Friday for the main purpose of
giving out the news, and that before
summoning newspaper men he had a
half-hour conferencc at the offices of J.
P. Morjran & Co.
Three N'ew York reporter* found the
baaker on the links of the National
Golf Club of America, at Southampton,
Long Island.
They encountered Mr. Sabin about
3:.''0 o'clock in the afternoon, as he was
playiflg the seventcenth hole. He was
? articipating ifl a fotirsome v, itll two
women and another man. and takinj;
sueh a keen interest in his game that
the reportcrs came up apparently un
noticed.
"Mr. Sabin," said one, "your name
has been jjiven out publicly as the
banker w!io on Fridav calied newspa?
per men into his office and told tnem
Ambassador ("rrard is on his way from
Berlin with peaee proposals from the
Kaiser."
Make** \b*olute Denial.
The banker stiffened. His eyes opened
wide |b astonishment. It was almost a
moment before he .spoke, and then he
said:
"I deny that absolutely."
He walked away a few paces, then
halted and turned around.
"Don't you see I'm play ing golf?" he
demanded, but wit-.out asperity. "I
don't know anything about it. That's
all there is to it. I won't say anything
about it."
"Would you care to hear the purport
of the statement which connects your
name with the peaee report?" asked an?
other of the newspaper men.
The banker did not reply.
"This comes from the Boston N'ew*
Bureau." pursued the reporter, produc
Ing a paper. It says: 'Financia! people
are entitled to know who the bank
president is who on Friday calied news?
paper representatives into his office and
gave them anonymously a statement
that Mr. Gerard comes to the I'nited
States witn a peaee proposal from the
Kaiser. The banker is Charlea II.
Sabm. He came from Southampton to
hia office on Friday and then went to

In Port Only Three Hours
Xewport. R. I., Oct. 7.?The U-53, flying the German flag
and with disappearing guns mounted forward and aft, steamed
into the outer harbor to-day and dropped anchor. The subma
rine lay within gunshot of Bailey's Beach and the ornate "cot
tages" of the summer colony. It left Wilhelmshaven seventeen
days ago.
.\fter paving a visit of courtesy to the naval commandant
and leaving a letter for the German Embassy, Lieutenant-Cap
tain Hans Kose, commander of the war vessel, hoisted his anchor
and steamed away at 5:17 p. m. His visit lasted three hours.
As to the contents of the important missive he had brought
for the German Ambassador, the U-boat's commander main
tained a discreet silence. Not even questions based on the
strong rumors of peaee negotiations which started when
Ambassador Gerard left Germany could move him. It might
be peaee, it might be war; he had come to deliver the letter.
