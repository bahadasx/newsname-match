Fulton Jurist Is Head of
New Organization in His
Own Town.
IT MUST BE MORAL
Necessity for Enforcement of
Law Emphasized in Model
Constitution.
What Judge Harris Says.
Columbia should have a fine Coun
try Club with 100 to 150 members.
Conditions in Columbia are Ideal for
a strong organization.
Put the club within walking dis
tance. I hope that the people will soon
enjoy themselves as the people of Ful
ton are now doing.
David H. Harris, Judge of the Cir
cuit Court, president of the new Ful
ton Country Club, considers condi
tions in Columbia ideal for the organ
ization of a strong country club. In
his office in the courthouse, after the
adjournment of court Friday, Judge
Harris expressed himself as enthusi
astic over the Idea and said that he
was eager to see the citizens of Co
lumbia take a step in this line, just
as the people of Fulton have done.
There is no reason In the world
why Columbia should not have a fine
country club with from 100 to 150
active members," said Mr. Harris. "We
received the charter for our new club
in Fulton only last Saturday, and al
ready we have had to change our
membership limit from sixty to eighty
members. If Fulton, with only 6,000
inhabitants can start off that well,
what ought not Columbia be able to
do?"
Rules of the Fulton Club.
Certain rules of conduct are neces
sary if a country club is to thrive in
a small city, according to Judge Har
ris, and these have been incorporated
In the constitution of the Fulton club.
First among these is the forbidding
of the use of intoxicants, or gambling
on the club property. Another rule
adopted by the Fulton club, which
has drawn forth much favorable criti
cism is that the property shall re
main closed to all members until 1
o'clock each Sunday afternoon. In or
der to not interfere with the morn
ing worship at the churches.
"Unless a country club in a city the
size of Columbia or Fulton Is conduct
ed along strictly moral lines, public
decency would and should see that it
is soon put out of existence," said Mr.
Harris. "It should be the aim of the
organization to have as members
those citizens whose conduct will help
to make the club a wholesome place
to spend one's Idle hours.
"Above all things, make the club a
walking proposition. I think it would
be a bad mistake to place a country
club In a small city so far away that
automobiles or any kind of vehicle
would be necessary. The club should
be located within, or as near the city
limits as possible, so that members
not having means of conveyance
would not be prevented from dropping
in as often as they feel like doing so.
The Fulton club grounds are within
the city limits, and easily reached on
foot from any part of the city.
Unselfishness a Keynote.
"The organizers of the proposed Co
lumbia Country Club cannot be too
careful about being clannish or ex
clusive in their selection of members."
continued Judge Harris. "Unselfish
ness is the keynote to a successful
club, and it cannot be popular other
wise, a clean, good class of citizens
should be sought after. Of course a.
membership limit must be set, from
the standpoint of accommodation, buti
that Is a matter to be decided by the '
organizers. We provided for an
amendment to our membership limit,
and were not long in taking advantage
of it."
Judge Harris is one of ten Fulton
citizens who invested $400 each in the
forty-acre tract which has become the
home of the Fulton club. The tract,
which Includes a handsome brick
house, cost $10,000. The property
has been turned over to the club on
the proposition that they pay the in
terest on the unpaid balance of $6,
000. Fhe years time Is given the
club to buy the property at cost. The
ten owners, all of whom are members
of the club, have, in other words,
turned over their Investment to the
organization without even asking for
the Interest due them for the money

The Dues Paid In Fulton.
"Of course It is not necessary for
the citizens of Columbia to follow out
our plan," continued Mr. Harris. The
plan, adopted by the Jefferson City
club, of paying down $10,000 and
borrowing the rest can be followed.
I would suggest that the organizers
write to the clubs of Sedalla. Hanni
bal, Springfield or Jefferson City and
find out the methods they used. All
these cities hare flourishing clubs of
Just the type and size Columbia should
have."
Each member of the Fulton club

NO YERICT IX BRADFORD CASE
Jury to Consider Whisky Prescription
Charges Again Monday.
Dr. George A. Bradford was tried
in the Circuit Court yesterday morn
ing on a charge of writing prescrip
tions for whisky for other than medi
cinal purposes. The charges were
ed by the Young Peoples' Branch of
the W. T. C. U. The jury was unable
to render a verdict last night, and was
excused until Monday morning.
According to the testimony of D. B.
Curtis, a junior in the College of Arts
and Science and the principal witness
for the state. Doctor Bradford wrote
a prescription for a quart of whisky
for him on each of four visits he made
to the office. He charges that the
Doctor knew that it was not to be
used as a medicine.
Witnesses for defense said that they
were present the first time that Mr
Curtis had called on Doctor Bradford
and that he had come into the office
acting as if he was in great pain.
They said that he had told the Doc
tor that he had rheumatism and that
he wanted some whisky for it, and
that Doctor Bradford wrote the pre
scription with this understanding af
ter he had made an examination.
Doctors Norris and Thornton said
that whisky and alcohol Is sometimes
used for rheumatism.
Tile defense admitted that Doctor
Bradford had written the prescrip
tions, but based their plea for acquit
tal upon the assumption that their
client had issued the prescriptions be
lieving that the whisky was to be used
as a medicine. They also asserted
that it was unreasonable to presume
that Doctor Bradford would violate
the law as charged for 50 cents.
WORKS 5 YEARS FOR CAPITOL
Mr. Stephens Discusses Completion of
Sew Building in Jefferson City.
Five years ago last Friday E. W.
Stephens was appointed chairman of

the exact time the new building will
be fully and finally completed," said
Mr. Stephens yesterday. "But we will
nut it this way. The building will be
entirely finished and ready for the fur
nishings when the latter are there for
installation. I would estimate that it
would require a year fof the state to
have its furnishings made for instal
