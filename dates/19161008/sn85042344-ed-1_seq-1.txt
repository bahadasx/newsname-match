KITS THE 8-HOUR LAW
Assails Democrats for Lack
of Militarv Strength
iu the U. S.
Colonel Deoree Harvey, who In
Hi')'! first Introduced W'oodrow- W'llsoti
Adionson law, tool the course. In tho
Mexican ami Kuropcan situations.
"A vote for Wilson Is a vote for
I'aniels," says Colonel Harvey In dis
ciissim; iinprepnreilnoss, and that ap
pears in his mind to be a Rood rea
son for turnniK the administration
out. although he cives many others.
"Slnci) l'ott Sumter was fired upon
to tiie arena ol presidential possibili
ties and who strove uncensliiKly In his
behalf until reiiiested by the candi
date in lit 1 3 to stop lor fear of of
fending the liryanltes, comes out
M,'.iari iy for llnnhcs and draws a run.
vlnoinjj indictment of tho Wllsonian
policies tn the current Issue of Tli'
North American P.cvlew.
Mr. Harvey condeinns tho Wilson
adnilnlstratlon for Us netrlect of mili
tary and industrial propuredness. the
(here has been no such assault upon
the rlnlit of tho American people to
rulo themselves, as that of ihe four
brotherhoods at WashliiKton In Au
Kust oi' the present year," Colonel
Marvey says In reference to the
"eiKht-hoiir law". "Then, as la '61.
Kovernment by a majority for the
whole iieople was openly threatened
by a self-constituted oligarchy."
.Not n (Jim's! Ion of Mollis.
"It was not a question of an olRht
liour day, as disingenuously siiKKcsted
by the president and proclaimed by
him as a thing decreed by 'society'. It
mis nothiiiK moro and nothing less
than 'a demand as to wages'. And
it was a demand bucked by the trims
Of liiKliwaynien and supoprted by tho
chief magistrate of the nation."
"We shall not recount tho ninny
episodes of the last threo years which
have flushed the chocks of our coun
trymen with shame and humiliation.
It suffices to say tn hitter truth that
no loiiKcr can an American stand erect
before any tribunal In the world, as
Paul stood before Pilate, and declare
, h , (.(,nridence his cltly.en-
. . 1 .. . ......
shto Not onlv has the nrolectlon of
! the flair been officially withdrawn
from those who have crossed tho bor
der line, but the flait Itself has been
wantonly desecrated over and over
iiKalu without InrurritiH" the swift
retribution which invariably hitherto
from the LcKlnniiiK of the republic
has been visited upon ol lenders. It
remains only to note the futility even
of hope that the policy of pusillanim
ity initiated hy Itself may he reversed
by this administration and to herald
with ii atifloation and "latitude the
dependable assurance of .Mr. Hughes
that he stands with no less steadfast
ness f ir American rluhts abroad thuu
for eiiual rights at home."
Future Is Critical.
Colonel Harvey declares that It Is
neither the past or the present, but
I the immediate future, that should
hold first place in the minds of Amer
ican citizens at this critical time.
"Whether it was the president, the
kaiser, or the i;ood Ijot'd who kept us
out of war Is of little moment," he
said. "The seeming fact that what
ever likelihood there may have been
of our being draw n Into the great con
flict no longer exists suffices present
needs The two vital iiucftlous to hv
answered at the polls one month
hence are:
"Which of the two fereat parties at
this particular Junction in our prog
ress as a nation is the better equipped
and the moro likely to render the
highest public service? And which
of tho two designated lenders Is the
moro certain to preserve, protect and
defend' the constitution of the Putted
States?"
liesplte the surpassing mental nnd
moral excellence of the new secretary
of war, as compared to Secretary
Iianlels, Colonel Harvey says the ariiiy
situation Is even more discouraging
than that of tho navy. He accuses
President Wilson of "twisting and
Kiiuirnilng and vainly trying to be
cloud the Issue to save his face as
master," Instead of frankly admitting
that he was unable to get what he
thought was best, and finally falling
Into a fateful compromise on the Hay
bill, "a hodge-podge, whoso sole merit
Is a trifling theoretical Increase in the
regular army, which lins not yet been
and seems not likely soon to be
realized -

They didn't work fust enouirh and

The races, as the main event of the
final day of the free state fair, brought
more people to .Muskogee than have
ever been here before.
Incoming trains on all railroads dis
gorged their masses of humniity
throughout the day and tonight, and
not all those who sought admission
to the fairgrounds could gain en

people witnessed ttie .u"nii!i ns from

Doors of thu Tulsa high night school
will open for the first time this year
and from tw.i to three hundred stu

the first classes.
Subjects iilieady chosen by pupils
aro typewriting, shorthand, bookkeep
ing, domestic science, millinery, tail
oring and Spanish.
Many subjects have been voted for
but as yet not enough students have
entered to warrant a course being
given. These are ancient history,
higher mathematics, physics, chemis
try, Krench and Herman. It is ex
pected that enough will be signed up
for these subjects by tomorrow night
In order to assure their being tnught.
Foreigners are taking advantage of
the school and enlarging the spelling
and penmanship class. This Is the
largest class In the school and many
men of 30 years of age have signed

Twelve classes have already been
formed and nlmost doubt that number
are expected before the school finally
gets down to work.
