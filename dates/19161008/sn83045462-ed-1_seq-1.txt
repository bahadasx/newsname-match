Capes.
"S. 0. S." CALLS MANY
VESSELS OFFERING AID;
Crew of Forty-Six Aboard Liner, But
Number of Passengers Not
Yet Known.
NEWPORT NEWS, Va.. October
7.?The Ward line steamship
Ar.tilla. with an unknown number
of passengers and a crew of fortysix,
is on fire at sea, 120 miles
east of the Virginia capes, according
to wireless messages
picked up by the operators at
Cape Henry and at other stations
in this vicinity. Many other
steamships and two reventle cutters
are rushing to respond to
her "S. O. S." calls for help, one
of the latest messages from the
Antilla stating hat "All on board
are taking to the boats."
The burning steamship, which
sailed from Guantanamo. Cuba,
September 30 for New York, is
apparently in the center of twenty-six
or twenty-seven ships,
which have taken up the wireless'
calls and are spreading them
broadcast. There is great confusion
of wireless, as the drama
of the sea is being played out on
the lonelv waters, but one vessel,
whose name was missed by the
land station in the confusion, obtained
an answer from the Antilla
shortly after 9 o'clock tonight
when she inquired if there are
passengers . aboard the Antilla.
The reply was a laconic "Yes,"
giving no details or numbers.
Steamship Somerset Nearest.
The steamship Somerset is said by
the wireless operators to be nearer to
the Antilla than any other vessel. She
sent a radio message at 9:30 o'clock
tonight that she was proceeding under
full steam to the location of the first
message sent, by the Ward liner. The
revenue cutters Onondaga and Apache !
were dispatched to the location given j
by the Antilla immediately upon re- j
ceipt of the first message from the I
Ward liner, telling of her plight, which j
was picked up by the wireless oper- !
ators at 8:34 o'clock tonight. This j
message was directed to the coast j
guard station at ''ape Henry and asked
that cutters be sent at once.
The last message from the Antilla.
dated at 10:05 o'clock p.m.. stated that
the passengers and most of the crew
had taken to the small boats and that
the wireless operator expected to be
forced to leave at any minute. In this
message it was again urged that ships
coming to the rescue of the Antilla
should come at full speed.
Once Under British Registry.
NEW YOF^K, October 7.?The steamship
Antilla sailed from Guantanarno,
Cuba, on September 30 for New York.
She was under command of Capt.
Blackadder, and carried a crew of forT

Officials of the company said tonight
they had received a message saying
that the vessel was on fire, hut

said, was loaded with sugar and lumber
and was due to arrive here tomorrow.

NEWPORT. R. I., October 7.?Seventeen
days from Wilheimshaven, the imperial
German submarine U-53 dropped
anchor in Newport harbor today.
Almost before the officers of the
American fleet of warships through
which the stranger had nosed her way
had recovered from their astonishment,
the undersea fighter had delivered a
message for the German ambassador
and, weighing anchor, turned Brenton's
reef lightship and disappeared beneath
the waves just inside the three-mile
lirr.it
As she came and went she flew the
black and white colors of the German
navy, a gun was mounted on the forward
deck and another aft, while eight
torpedoes plainly visible under the forward
deck, gave mute assurance that
the warship was ready for a light at
the drop of the hat.
Makes New World Record.
IJeut.-Capt. Hans Rose, who hung up
a new world's record in bringing ar.
armed submarine in battle array across
the Atlantic, said that he had called
at Newport simply to ma 1 a letter tc
Count von Bernstorff. He required
neither provisions nor fuel and would
be on his way, he said, long befoj*?
the twenty-four hours during which i
belligerent ship may remain within z
neutral harbor had expired.
The submarine was in Americar
waters a little more than three hours
assuming that she continued to sea
after submerging. Within that tirm
; the German commander paid offlcia

BOSTON, October 7.?The
wellnigh perfect base ball machine
of the Boston American
League Club triumphed .over the
Brooklyn Nationals here this afternoon,
6 to 5, in the first game of
the world series, but marred its
victorv by skidding badly in the
final inning. For a full eight in!
nings the thirty-odd thousand
j loyal suporters 01 tmc j\cu jua s.h
back with a complacent air of
satisfaction upon their features
while the junior league champions
roamed through their National
League rivals to a lead of 6
to 1.
With the game apparently packed
away in their bat bag, the Carrigan
clan began to wabble, led
by Pitcher Ernie Shore, and before
the last Brooklyn batter had
been retired the Superbas had
amassed four tallies and appeared
upon the verge of wresting the
initial game away from the
American Leaguers.
Break Is Feature of Game.
This surprising- break, of which the
invading team from Greater New York
was quick to take advantage, was the
' feature of an otherwise rather ordinary
j base ball game. Before the threatening
i rush of the Superbas developed in their
! final turn at bat, the contest appeared
! to indicate that the Boston players
would swine: through to easy conquest.
and the startling- break in the steady
work of the local club furnished the
thrill needed to fix the memory of the
struggle in the minds of the fans without
leaving a sting, since the Red Sox
were able to check the rush of their
? rivals just when victory appeared to be
i : turning into defeat.
; ! When Daubert, the first Brooklyn
I | batsman, stepped to the plate in the
opening half of the ninth inning, the
* j spectators were beginning to leave
I I Braves' Field. But they halted in their
I I tracks as Shore passed the Superbaoap.
i tain and Casey Stengel sent him to sec- j
i_ ond with a clean single. A lone BropkL
i lyn rooter began to beat upon a tin pan, j
j and here and there were cries of en- j
i ' couragement for the National League j
, i champions, but the cheers died away as
i j Wheat forced Daubert at third.
! Shore Loses Control.
1 i Shore, however, could not control the j
' ball as he had earlier in the game and j
" hit Cutshaw. Mowrey arose to the oc- j
; casion with a bounder which Janvrin '
' ; could not handle, and Stengel and
? Wheat crossed the plate, while the Boston
fans began to move uneasily in
* their seats. Their fears grew when Olj
son beat out an infield hit, and they
I were scarcely relieved when Chief Mcy.
ers fouled out. Alerkle, batting for
Pfeffer, outwaited Shore and walked,
i forcing in Cutshaw with the third run ^
of the inning.
There was not a sound from the
> j thousands when Manager Carrigan ordered
Shore front the box and substituted
Mays Myers, Brooklyn's lead-i
off batter, scratched an infield hit, scor j
t. ing Mowrey, and the Nationals were!
_ j within a run <>f tying the score with the
r ; bases still loaded. Daubert came to the
I plate for the s<-<ond time in the inning,;
j and every one of the thousands of spec-j
t a tors hold his breath as the Brooklyn;
. captain hit ari ugly bounder to Scott.
Th?- shortstop speared tin; bail as it
; leaped from tin turf and without paus?
ing even to sight, whipped it to Hob*
d litzell. Daubert, sliding into the bag
e h?*ad first, appeared 10 arrive with the
" j flashing ball, but there was a great
II cheer when CinfNre O'luv. who fairly
overhung ih? base, signaled the third
,, out and the ending of the game.
" | Showed Boston's Resources.
t | It was a climax that showed the re(
1 houi''s and strength of tlie Red Sox
it ijrid* r pressure. But it was not the
' on y exhibition of a similar nature.
't icriit Fielder Harry Hooper uncovered
,, ?u* tar individual play of tne day in
in- fourth session when he made a
K*? at running catch of Cutshaw's
i v. mting fly and nipped Wheat trying j
y<>v- from third. The ball left Cut- 1
" ii.iv. "k bat as if undecided where it;
^ ' i ruing and Hooper had to sprint
v? ! 1 over toward the foul Jine just back
K of first base before he could get his
' oands on it. The effort caused him to
ilp to the turf in a sitting position,
but h?* was up like a flash arid while
ill rising hurled the ball straight as
.i biilb-t to Cady. The latter slammed
" , it on Wheat's ankle as he reached for
| the plate with his foot at the end of a
j per feet hook slide.

official report from two ships recently
attacked.
The first steamer was the Anna Lea
of Bergen. Her officers report that a
submarine with one gun visible forward.

the periscope of a second submarine
being visible at the same time, attacked
the vessel with gunfire on October

SAYS DEMOCRACY'S UNITED
FRONT MEANS PROGRESS;
Tells Independents While His National
Policy Is Attacked, "No
Diagrams of Any Other Drawn."
LONG BRANCH, N. J., October T ?
Returning from his first invasion of
the middle west since the campaign
opened, President Wilson today appealed
to independent voters to support
the democratic party in November on
the ground that it presents a united
front for the passage of progressive
legislation, while the republican party j
is made up of discordant elements J
Criticising the "old guard" of the
republican party, the President by inference
attacked both Charles K.
Hughes and I'heoddre Roosevelt, and
declared that while every line of his
national policy has been assailed, "no
diagrams have been drawn of any
other."
Mr. Wilson charged that the "old
guard" was in control of the last republican
convention, and "made all the j
choices that were made by that convention."
The President spoke to a delegation
of progressives, independents and college
men. who came here in a private
train and inarched to Shadow Lawn
with a band playing popular music
while they sang a song with the refrain,
"He's kept us out of war."
Foot Ball Stars in Guard.
Mr. Wilson was intioduced by Prof.
Irving Fisher of Yale, a member of
the Roosevelt conservation commission,
and Hugh Gordon Miller, a New York
| progressive, who denounced the leadi
ers of his party who have gone over
j to the republicans. In the delegation
also was the "Wilson guard." made up
i of former foot ball stars. The Presij
dent said, in part:
I "We are indeed at a critical juncture
; ih the affairs of the world, and the
affairs of the world touch America
very nearly. She does not stand apart.
Her people are made up out of the
peoples of the world. Her sympathies
are as broad as "the extended stocks
of national governments. There is
nothing human that does not concern
her. And in the midst of this situation
we arc about to determine
whether we shall change the line of

that national policy has been ques;
tioned, but no diagrams have been
drawn of any other; every One of the
lines handsomely projected in the last
three and a half years had been questioned
and condemned.
"Lines Becoming Clear."
"Fortunately the lines of this campaign
have recently been becoming
very clear indeed. The choice is a very
definite one. which rloes not. reouire
any subtle analysis for its determination.
On the one hand there is a party
which is united, made up of congenial
j elements, and which has determined
its direction by its performances and
not by its promises. You know what
j the democratic party has accomplished.
You know that it neither can turn
j back nor desires to turn back. You
| know that it is united as never united
! before, and you know that there is
no conflict of counsel within its ranks.
You have a compact and, therefore, irresistible
force to accomplish some- i
thing in particular.
"Some very interesting things have
happened in the democratic party in
the last three years and a half. When
I went to Washington 1 went with
certain men in my mind who had long
been influential in the counsels of Congress
who, I was told, were reactionaries,
men, I mean, in the democratic
ranks. And I want to say for
these men that no wheel horse in harness
ever pulled harder than they did
| in the direction of the party's program
i of progress. So that I can testify that
back of me as a leader of the party
there is an organized, enthusiastic and
determined team that is ready to do
teamwork and obey every signal.
' Associated for Unavowed Object."
"On the other hand, what have we? It j
baffles description. Men of every sort
and variety .of purpose. I will not say
united, but associated for an unavowed I
object. More interesting than that and j
more ominous than that, shot through !
with every form of bitterness, every
ugly form of hate, every debased pur|
pose of revenge and every covert desire
to recover secret power, a party
made up. like the occupants of the
ancient cave of Adullum. of everybody
discontented and insurgent against I
existing circumstances and therefore !
not. very happily in conference with j
one another.
"What would happen if the republican
party should succeed on the 7th
of November? If 1 were a leader of j
that party 1 would be. afraid to get
elected, 1 would know that nothing but !
futility and disappointment awaited me. I
Hecause. oddly enough, the only dis- i
tinct definitions of purpose come from i
the collateral branches of the family, j
The only articulate voice, a very articulate
voice, professes opinions and j
purposes at w hich the rest in private |
shiver and demur.
"Country Clamors for Definition."
"When the whole country is clamoring
for definition it is legitimate to)
take it where you can get it,' and the
definitions are backed by certain
things that have already happened in
our politics. One branch of that party,
the collateral branch to which I have
just referred, backed as a candidate
for the United States Senate in the,
state of New York a man whose avowed !
position in respect of international af- [
fairs was unneutral, and whose inten- J

affairs at Washington, to promote the !
interests of one side in the present war

Therefore we are warranted in believing
that if the republican party
should succeed, one very'large branch j
of it would insist upon what its leader
has insisted upon?a complete re- ]
veral of policy, and, in view of the sup- ,
port the candidate I have referred to in
New York received, that reversal of ]
policy can only be a reversal from
peace to war. If they do not engage in

by the British. These villages
stretch along a front more
than ten miles in length east of
the Struma immediately north of
Lake Tahinos, and are Ago Mah,

and Elishan. A counter
attack made by the Bulgarians
against the village of Nevolyen,
occupation of which by British
forces was reported yesterday,
was repulsed.
Bulgar Positions Taken.
Bulgarian positions north of Pojar,
north of Lake Ostrovo, were captured
yesterday by the Serbians. A large
number of prisoners and much booty
also were taken.
In the regjon of the Cerna river the
Serbian troops have debouched from
the Kaimakoalan plateau and advanced
detachments have reached the Bela
Voda river, about sixteen miles east
, of Monastir.

nounced that the Rumanians again
j have crossed tlie Danube and invaded
I Bulgaria, also gives color to the official
declarations of Bucharest and 1'etrograd
that von Mackensen's men slowly
are being forced backward in the Dobrudja,
it declaring:
"The battle in Dobrudja has been
very violently resumed, but the presence
of the Rumanians on the shoulders
of the enemy paralyzes his activity."
The latest Rumanian declaration
says: "In Dobrudja the Rumanians
have captured trenches from the Teutonic
and Bulgarian forces." The Rusj
tans have occupied two villages and
i have repelled attacks, advancing on
j the right flank.
J Berlin declares that the enemy at
tacks at various points between the
, Danube and the Black sea were reJ
pulsed.
Rumanians Resume Drive.
Rumanian troops have resumed the
i offensive in the Caneni and Jiul valleys
; in Transylvania, says the official statei
rr.ent issued by the war office today.

1 Austro-Hungarian general headquarters
j tonight reads:

An official statement issued by the
Austro-Hungarian war office today, announcing
the capture of thirty big Rumanian
guns in eastern Transylvania,
says:
"Rumanian front: In t lie fortified
position on tin- western border of the
Geister forest the enemy was at fa eked
and completely beaten by Austro-Hungarian
and German troops tinder Field
Marshal von Falkenhayn. We capt ured
twenty-eight field gr:.s. two heavy

Berlin Claims Successes.
The German statement says:
"Transylvania?Over the whole eastern
front the allied (Teutonic) troops
are making- progress. TheV have closely
pursued and pressed back through
the Geister forest the retreating er.eniy
and have repulsed the rear guards.

on both sides of Rothenthurm
pass two officers and 133 men were

"South of Hatszeg the frontier height
of Sigleu was wrested from the Rumanians.

Orsova."
Bitterness apparently is being displayed
in the fighting betwen the Teutons
and Rumanians in Transylvania,
according to Berlin. The number of
prisoners is insignificant in proportion
to the results obtained. A striking example
of this is shown in the German
official report of Friday announcing
the Rumanian defeat in the Sinca sector.

but only a few hundred prisoners
were taken.
