Huston began to wahlile, led by Pitch
er Karnest Shore, and before the last
Brooklyn hatter hud been retired, the
Biuoklyns had gained four tallies.
This surprising break, of which the
invading team was iuick to take ad
vantage, was the feature of an other
wise ordinary baseball game.
When Baubert, the first Hrooklyn
batsman, stepped to the plate In the
opening half of the ninth inning, the
spectators were beginning to leave
Braves field, but they halted in their
tracks as Shore passed the batter and
Casfy Stengel sent him to second with
it liean single. A lone Hrooklyn
router began to beat upon a tin pan
and here and there were cries of en

champions, but the cheers died away

tIPCCIAU DISPATCH TO MOANINO JOURNAL
New York, Oct. 7. Republican pa
pers in the east have momentarily 1 ast
aside partisanship in acknowledging
with unusual frankness the unprece
dented reception accorded President
Wilson on his western trip.
The New York Tribune, which can
boast of its long and unbroken record
of republicanism, in a special dispatch
from IMiuiha, describes President Wil
son's reception as "11 phenomenon
which In the opinion of observers has
seldom been equalled in this or other

Mr. Wilson iharged that tho "old

I Parly Itcady for Teamwork.
Some very inle resting things havf
happened ill the democratic party ill

I More interesting than that and more
'ominous than that, shot through with
lively form of bitterness, every ugly
form of hale, every debased purpose
j of revenge, and every covert desire
j to recover secret power, a party iniulo

1 ,-Hve of Adtillum, of everybody dis

another.
I "What would happen If Ihe repub

I that party 1 would be nfraid to get
