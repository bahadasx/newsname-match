NEWPORT, R. I., Oct. 7 Seventeen
days from Wilhelmshaven, the imperial
(ierman submarine 1 ' -53 dropped an
chor in Newport harbor todav.
Almost before the officers of the
American fleet of warships through
which the stranger had nosed her way,
had recovered from their astonishment,
the undersea fighter had delivered a
message tor the Herman ambassador
and .weighing anchor, turned at Bren
ton's Heef light ship and disappeared
beneath the waves just inside the three
mile limit.
As she came and went, she flew the
Mack and white colors of the (Ierman
jiavy. A gun was mounted on the fore
deck and another aft, while eight tor
pedoes plainly were visible under the
forward deck giving mute asurance that
the warship was ready for a fight at
the dii n of the hat.
Lieutenant Captain Hans Hose, w ho
hung up a new world's record in bring
ing an armed submarine in battle array
' across the Atlantic, said that he had
called at Newport simply to mail a
leiter to Count von Hernstorff. He re
tinired neither provisions nor fuel and

American officers returned the brief
call promptly.
While these formalities were being
exchanged, wireless messages were
Ci;ri ing to the ships of the British and
French patrol fleet off the coast, a
warning that a hostile submarine had
Slipped through their cordon.
There were rumors, without appar
ent h.tsTs, "(nalthe German merchant
submarine l'.rcmen, long overdue, might
be expected in the wake of the war
ship. Some naval officers expressed
the opinion that the fighter had es
corted t'le Bremen across the ocean,
and ethers that she was searching for
the merchant ship. The first question
nsked by Captain Rose when a motor
boat came alongside was "Have you
heard from the Hremen?"
When he was told that there was no !
news of the missing craft his face be- I
came grave but he made no com
ment. To naval men, the most Interesting
fact disclosed by Captain Rose was
that tie had been at sea seventeen days
and still had provisions for three
m nths; abundant fuel, and needed no

water was taken aboard, and the ship
Has spiel; arid span.
The U-53 was first sighted from land
at 1:45 o'clock this faternoon, as she
was entering the inner httrbur escorted
by the United States submarine D-2.
The American had been outside for
maneuvers since morning and was re
turning when she came" up with the
German. The D-2 drawing near the
strangers and making out her type,
tent a ireless message to the snore
headquarters of Admiral Knight, who
telayed word of the appearance of the
1-53 to the navy department at Wash
ington. The American submarine pre
ceded the visitor into the harbor.
The first report had it that it was
the Bremen which was coming in. A
newspaperman who had watched for
weeks for the merchant submarine,
rlimbed to the tower of the United
States engineers office and with the
aid of powerful glasses, made out two
puns on the submarine.

Ho longer was planning but has actu

men without warning, the British for
eign office gave to the Associated Press
today the official report from two
ships recently attacked.
The fiist steamer was the Anna Lea
of I.eri.tn. Her officers reported that
a submarine with one gun visible for
ward painted gray and very rusty, the
periscope of a second submarine being
foible at the same time, attacked the
vessel with gun fire on October f with
out warning. The ship sustained no
damage but her master was ordered to
pick up the craw of the Norwegian
steamship Cederic of 1,128 tons gross,
which previously had been sunk.
The second case was that of the
1'rltith steamer Isle -of Hastings. Ac
cording to the official report the ves
sel was attacked by a (ierman subma

men were picked up. Nothing is known

The U-53 had made her way through
the fleet of thirty-seven United States
war ships, including destroyers and
marines, to an anchorage 200 yards to
the westward of the torpedo station.
Captain Rose stood on the quarter deck
as the correspondent came aboard and
after inquiring about the Hremen, said
that he hud come in to mail a letter
to Count von Hernstorff, and asked for
the newspaperman's credentials.
The latter exhibited an Associated
Press badge and was entrusted witli

The correspondence contained in a

Soon after the U-53 dropped anchor

been dispatched from the naval station
to bring Commander Rose ashore. The
Ocrman officer came up to the city un

Despite t'.ie fact that Count von

has stated he knows positively that
Mr. (ierard is coming on no such mis
sion and the state department,, was
moved today by the ersistency of the
story to issue an official denial, it cir
culates widely in official and diplomatic
circles and was seriously discussed as
a possibility.
The dramatic arrival of t'le German
war submarine U-.,3 at Newport, with
dispatches for Count von Hernstorff
Just before he has an audience with
President Wilson on Monday, served to
add color to the circumstantial chain of
events. The German embassy ronfght
disclaimed any knowledge of the nature
of the dispatch, or the mi.st.ion of the
Hubm-ii'ine in Amercap waters
Slate department nfft'tal.t i.-'ued this
statement in regard to the rumor: "We
have no reason to believe there is any
thing in it and every reason to believe
there ts nothing in it."
Adding to this they declare that when
Mr. Gerard left Herlin for Copenhagen
he only intended to say good-bye to
Mrs. Gerard who was sailing for home,
and at the last hour determined to ac
company her when he received instruc
tions from Washington to take his va
cation. The only tangible element connected
with the story us a complete set of
denials. Still it has been pieced to
gether from a chain of consecutive
events in such a way that it is given
a measure of credence both in Europe
and he United States.
One possibility that stands out is
that President Wilson himself, may
know some reason for Mr. Gerard's
home coming that is not known to the
state department or the German am
bassador. Soon after the war broke out and
President Wilson sent formal offers of
mediation to the belligerents, official
int'rnation came from both sides that
any ouiside interference would be re
sented. All the reports to the president
from the American ambassadors and
from his personal envoy. Colonel E.
M House, who went abroad to survey
the situation bore out that position and
soon afterward it was made known at
the White House on various occasions
when peace movements were presented
by Individuals that President Wilson
did not thing the time opportune for
another peace offer.

The Herald applauds the designa

that he is an imperative need "when
Japan is facing a situation in the
Kar East fraught with eventualities

newspr.pcr thinks Count Terauchi's
authority in the arms' will permit

Another group of writers thinks
that the appointment shows that con

LONG HP.AN'CII, N. .1., Oct.
Returning from the middle west,
President Wilson today appealed to
independent voters to support tho
democratic party in November on the
ground that it presents a united front
for the passage of progressive legis
lation.
Criticizing the "old guard" of the
republican party, the president by in
ference attacked both Charles K. j
Hughes and Theodore Roosevelt and I
declared that while every line of his
national policy has lieen assailed "no
c'iagrams have been drawn of any
other." Mr. Wilson charged that the
"old guard'' was in control of the last
republican convention.
The president soke to a delegation
of progressives, independi nts and col
lege men who marched to Shadow
l-awn with a band playing wnile they
sa-ig a song with the refiyin: "He's'
kept us out of war."
Mr. Wilson was introduced by Pro
fessor Irving Fisher of Yale, a mem
ber of the HMisevelt conservation
commission, and Hugh Gordon Miller,
a New York progressive. In Die dele
gation also was the "Wilson guard,"
made up of former football stars.
President Wilson's speech was In
part as follows:
"We are indeed at a critical junc
ture in the rffairs of the world, an.l
the affairs of the world touch Amer
ica very nearly. She does not stand
apart. Her people are made up of the
peoples of the world. Her sympathies
ars as broad as the extended stocks
i of national governments. There is
'nothing human that does not concern
her. And in the midst of this situa
tion we are about to determine
iv hetber wo shall chance the line iff
our national policy. Every line af
that national policy has been ques,
tiened, but no diagrams have been
drawn of any other; every one of the
lilies handsomely projected in the last
three and a half years has been ques
tioned and condemned.
"Fortunately the lines of this cam
paign have recently been becoming
very clear indeed. The choice Is a
ery definite one which does not re
quire any subtle analysis for its de
termination
On the one hand there is a party
which is united, made up of congenial
elements and which has determined
its diiection by its performances 'and
not bv its promises. Yon know what
the democratic party has accom
plished. You know that it neither can
turn back nor desires to turn back.
"Some very Interesting things have
happened in the democratic iwirty in
the last three years and a half. When
I went to Washington, I w-ent with
(crtain men in mv mind who had long
been influential in the counsels of
congress who I was told were reac-
tlonaiies. men I mean in the demo
cratic ranks. And I want to sav for
these men that, no wheel-horse in
harness ever pulled harder than they
did in the direction of the party's
! rogrnm for progress. So that I can
test My that back of me as a leader of
the party, there is an organized, en
thusiastic nml determined team that
is realy -to do team work and ohv
every signal.

Entente allied forces are pressing
hard upon troops defending occupied
territory in the Halkans. lioth In Mace
donia and Dobrudja the invaders have
been compelled, to give ground before
atacks.
On a front of 10 miles northeast and
east of the Struma river, Hritish troops
have occupied five villages. Farther
west on the Macedonian front Serbian
troops have reached the Bela Voda
river, about 16 miles east of Monastir.
French troops have occupied the town

In the region of Lake Rutjeva, Italian
troops have advanced. Russian and
Rumanian forces have taken ground
in Dobrudja. The Russians have oc

atacks.
On the right flank the Rumanians
have occupied some trenches and re

An unconfirmed message from Rome
is that another Rumanian expedition
has crossed the Danube into Hulgaria,
apparently behind the lines held by
Field Marshal von Mackenseri.

CLEVELAND, O.. Oct. 7. John M.
Parker, progressie nominee for vice
president, in opening his campaign
j tour here tonight criticized the Adam
I son eight-hour law and the manner
I of Its enactment, denounced the
i "bertyal" of the progressive party of
its leaders at Chicago last June,
scored the professional politician and
j labor agitator and made a plea for
I maintenance of the progressive party
i organization and its principles. Mr.
j Parker arraigned both republicans
and democrats for their alleged ma
chine'" methods and policies of gov
ernment, but was more severe in his
criticism of the republican party
which he branded as the "party of
siiecial privileges."
He also -reiterated his reasons, giv
en in a recent' statement, why he
would work against Charles E. Hughes
republican candidate for president,
but he did not urge the re-election
of President Wilson. His opposition
was rather to the parties they rep
resented than to the canidates them
selves. Mr. Parker argued for the
elimination from politics and national
affairs, of sectionalism or agitation
of sectionalism and deplored the
"harping'' by politicians upon hyphen
ated Americanism and as creating un
rest and discord in the nation's life.
He said in part:
"The progressive party in 112 made
the people of the nation begin to
think.
"It was the first political party of
all time which put welfare above the
dollar, and the only party which has
ever dared make the struggle for
right above the power of might..
"Its demand for the regional bank
and removal of the power from Wall
Street, of any other interest to con
trol the financial policy of this coun
try has been enacted into law, and
today the wheat, corn, oats, cotton,
cane, rice and livestock of our farm-
! pr
largely represent the best class
of securitj-.
"Capital for years held labor un
der servile control and thus amassed
vast fortunes. Today labor has capi-
i tal terrorized, and hv the nower of
tho strike mnv ranu untold snfferine-
and wn.'estrt-ead disaster, hv the de-
struction of the edifice which gives
capital profitade investment, and la
bor useful employment, a living and
competency.
Half baked laws by theorists are
a menace to the prosperity of our
nation, and the hurried passake of
legislation by threats of a fearful
strike is not only a dangerous pre
cedent to the real working man. but
is a serious reflection on the cour
age and statesmanship of our lawr

BURNING ST'AMEB:
twenty-six or twenty-seven ships had
taken up the call and were spreading
it broad cast offering to go to the
aid of the burning ship and directing
those believed to be closed to the
Antilla to proceed there. One ship
whose name was missed by the land
station in the confusion, secured an
answer from the Antila shortly after
nine o'clock, when she inquired
whether there were passengers aboard.
The reply was atfirmatlve but gave
no number.
The Somerset which is said to be
the closest to the Antilla, wirelessed
at 9:30 that she was proceeding un
der full steam to the location given
in the first message from the Ward
liner.
. No further word has been received
from the Antilla or any of the res
cue boats when land wireless stations
hereaoouts closed at midnight. The
supposition is that the wireless op
erator on the Antilla was forced to
quit nis post atter his last message
after 10 o'clock.
A comparatively calm sea was run
ning tonight, it was said, and marine
men expresed the belief that the
small boats v.ould have no difficulty
in existing until recue ships arrived.
There was a heavy teg along the
coast tonight, however, and fears
were expresed that the Somerset
might have difficulty in finding the
small boats from the Antilla. Even
though they should not be located
until tomorrow, little fear for safety
of the ship's company was felt here.
