Buying Buzz Buggies.
Notwithstanding the fact that the
cotton crop in this section is very
short and complaints of hard timer,
are being constantly uttered, the
people seem to have plenty of money
to buy automobiles and are buying
them in largiyjumbers. A well post
financier states that during the
past six months citizens of Columbus
and the contiguous territory have ex
pended $250,0(10 in the purchase of
machines, and the demand is said to
be so great that local dealers are ex
periencing difficulty in supplying it.

MONDAY TO BE OBSERVED
AS FIRE PREVENTION
GOVERNORS OF MANY STATES
ISSUE PROCLAMATIONS
HOW IT ALL STARTED.
Governor Theo. G. Bilbo has is
sued a proclamation designating Oc
tober 9 as "Fire Prevention Day" in
Mississippi, and calling upon the peo
ple to make special efforts to clear
houses of rubbish, and upon educa
tors to have fire drills in the schools.
On October 9, 1871, according to
the story which we are told, and
which we believe or not as we see
fit, one Mrs. O'Leary went out into
the barn to milk the cow on her little
farm just on the outskirts of the city
of Chicago. It was far from light
and she carried a lantern, which she
placed on the stable floor and then
sat down to do her milking.
Now what particular devil pos
sessed that cow does not appear. At
any rate the cow was moved to kick,
and the cow's hoof struck the lan-!
tern. The lantern fell over, The!
oil spilled on the floor, and the city
of Chicago was all but wiped off the !
map.
That is the story we are told of
the way the great Chicago fire start
ed. Whether it is true or not is be
side the mark. It is typical. Many
fires started in just such a way.
But however it started, the city of
Chicago has reason fo remember
that day in October, and so it is that
Chicago has taken a mighty interest
in the establishment of a National
Fire Prevention Day on the anni
versary of its misfortune, that other
municipalities may learn a lesson
from its experience.
The movement for Fire Preven
tion Day was started by the Safety
First Federation of America. Last
year, the governors of twenty-nine
states gave forth proclamations call
ing upon their people to observe the
day by cleaning up their homes; by
removing rubbish from dark corners;
by seeing that they were prepared
to meet fire if it came. This year,
it is believed that practically every
state will take part in this great
movement, and there is reason to
hdpe that President Wilson may issue
a proclamation that will go far to
ward awakening people to their
grave danger and to put the move
ment on a firm' national foundation.
In his letters to the governor; urg
ing them to impress upon the people
the need of preventing the low o
life and property by fire Frederick
II. Elliott, executive secretary of the
Safety First Federation, laid dowr
the following program:
That on October 9, all public
buildings, factories and homes be
thoroughly cfeaned of rubbish ac
cumulation. That all heating, lighting and fire
extinguishing apparatus be examined
and if found defective, promptly re
faired. That fire drills be held in all
schools, factories and other place.'
where fire drills are necessary.
That lectures be Riven in , public
schools and that sermons be preached
in the churches on the subject of f.re
prevention, and that meetings be
held to arouse public interest in the
movement,
The latest estimate of the loss by
fire in the United States and Canada
i in 1914 was $250,000,000. All to
this the cost of maintaining fire de
partments and the total is $500,000,
000. This amount is so stupendous
that the mini cannot conceive it

INf CASLS DISPOSED OF
IN THE MAYOR'S COURT
STEALING OF ONE PISTOL RE
SULTS IN ARREST OF SEV.
ERAL NEGROES.
The stealing of a pistol the past
week by Roy Richardson, a negro,
resulted in the city taking in several
hundred extra dollars. Not only did
Richardson steal the weapon, but 'n
the investigation of the case, Police
men Munger and Moorehead founl
that the gun had been in the-tiands of
several negroes who knew it had
been stolen, and also a blind tiger
was caught.
In mayor's court Friday morning
Richardson was fined $25 and sen
tenced to work thirty days on the
street, on a charge of petit larceny.
A fine of $25 and thirty days was
also imposed upon him for carrying
a pistol concealed. Willie Blake was
the one who was found retailing
liquor and he was fined $50 and
thirty days. Will Taylor, Jr., who
bought and disposed of the pistol
stolen by Richardson was fined $10,
and Mack llarmond was sentenced
to pay a fine of $25 and 30 days for
carying the same gun conceeded. He
appealed his case.
Yesterday morning quite a num
ber of negroes were before Mayor
Gunterimong the number being
Jack Brown, who was not only fined
$25 and thirty days on a charge of
carrying concealed weapons, but was
tried on a charge of petit larceny,
having stolen a bicycle, and he was
sentenced to pay $15 and serve 0
days. It was found that Brown also
stole a bicycle some time ago belong
ing to Mr. Clemon Egger, the whel
having been returned to its owner
several nights ago. Mayor Gunter
placed a fine of $25 and 25 days on
him for this charge. Brown was ar
rested by officers Cook and Hudson.
Sam Bell, a negro who swore false
ly in a trial held Friday, was bound
over under the sum of $200 to await
the action of the grand jury.
$500,000,000 would build a Panama
Canal. There is a tax of $5 a head
on every man, woman and child in
the United States. It means that
every family of seven people pays
$35 a year for fire protection.
The pity of it all is that ninety
per cent of all fires are preventable.
Ninety per cent of all fires are due
be carelessness in erecting the build
be cerelessness in erecting the build
ing; it may be carelessness in hand
ling gasoline; it may be carelessness
in placing matches or in hanging
curtains close to a gas jet. It may
be carelessness in neglecting to put
up lightning rods, but it is careless
ness and it might be prevented.
The Safety First Federation en
dorses the idea of making the person
whose property is burned through
carelessness pay for extinguishing
that fire, as well as to pay for any
damage done to his neighbor's prop
erty. In Pennsylvania, laws have
iust been passed embodying this
principle, and it is now established
in the city of New York, which re
cently collected from several con
cerns the cost of the water used on
the fire, the pro rata salaries of the
men who worked at it, a rental on
the apparatus and an additional
charge to cover the overhead.
It is held that a man should be just
as much responsible for burning his
neighbor's property as he would if
his neighbor fell into a hole in his
sidewalk and was hurt.
