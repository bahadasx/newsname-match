NEWPORT, R. I.. Oct. 7. Sev
enteen days from Wilhelmshaven.
the Imperial German submarine
U-D3 dropped anchor in Newport
harbor today.
Almost before the officers of
the American fleet of warships
through which the stranger had
nosed her way, had recovered
from their astonishment, the un
dersea fighter had delivered a
message for the German ambassa
dor and weighing anchor, turned
at Boston Lightship and disap
peared beneath the waves just in
Fide the three mile limit.
As she came tinder way she flew the
black and white colors of Germany
and a gun wa9 mounted on the for
ward deck and another aft while 8
torpedoes were plainly visible under
the forward deck giving mute assur
ance that the warship was ready for
a fight at the drop of the hat.

hung up' a world record bringing
-an armed submarine in battle array
across the Atlantic, said he had come
into port simply to mail a letter to
Ambassador Bernstorff, and that neith
er provisions nor supplies were need
ed and that long before the twenty-
four hour period was tip he would be i
on his wav.
Within the harbor the German com-j
manior os?id official visit to Rear Ad
miral Knight, commaniler of the nav
al district and Rear Admiral Cleaves,
commander of the destroyer force of
the Atlantic fleet which was aboard
the flagship, the scout cruiser Birm
ingham. Roth American officers returned the
call promtply.
There were rumors, without appar
ent basis, that the German merchant
submarine Bremen. long overdue,
might be expected in the wake of the
warship. Some naval officers express
ed the opinion that the fighter had es-
corted the Bremen across the ocean, I
and others that she was searching for
the merchant ship. The first question
asked by Captain Rose, when a mot
orboat came alongside was "have you
heard from the Bremen?"
When he was told that there was
tio news of the missing craft his face
became grave, but he made no com
ment. To naval men, the most interesting
fact disclosed by Captain Rose was
that he had been at sea seventeen
days and still had provisions for three
months, abundant fuel and needed no
repairs. Not so much as a bottle of
water was taken aboard and the ship
was spick and span.

sent a wireless message to the shore

word of the appearance of the IT-53 to

When arrangements were perfected

announced that the most elaborate

press box in Boston. The very second
a play was made, the instant a ball or
a strike was pitched, the editor in
charge signaled it to the operators.
The wires from the grounds ran to
every part of the country. To dis

is handled it can be said that, in all

Meet in Second Game at
Boston, Monday at 2 P. M.
(By Review Leased Wire)
BOSTON, Oct. 7. The well
nigh perfect baseball machine of
the Boston American league club
triumphed over the Brooklyn Na
tionals here this afternoon 6 to
5 in the first game of the world's
series, but marred its victory by
skidding badly in the final inning.
For 8 innings the thirty odd thou
sand Icyal supporters of Boston
sat with a complacent air of satis
faction while the junior league
champions romped through their
National league rivals to a lead
of six to one.
SCORE 4 IN NINTH.
With the game apparently won,
Boston began to wabble, led by
Pitcher Earnest Shore, and before
the last Brooklyn batter had been
retired, the Brooklynj had gained
four tallies.
This surprising break of which the
invading team was quick to advantage
was the feature of an otherwise or
dinary game.
A lone Brooklyn rooter began to bat
upon a tin pan and here and there
were cries of encouragement for the
National league champions, but the
cheers died away as Wheat forced,
Daubert at third.
Shore Blows Up.
Shore, however, could xfjt control
the ball as he had done earlier in the
game, and hit Cutshaw. Mowrey
arose to the occasion with a bounder
which Janvrin could not handle and
Stengle and Wheat crossed the plate.
Faces of the Boston fans grew white
when Olson beat out an infield hit and
j they were scarcely relieved when
Chief Meyers lulded out
Suspense Is Great.

to the plate for the second time in the
inning and thousands of spectators
held their breath as the Brooklyn rap

even to sight, whipped it to HoblitzelL

but there wa3 a great cheer when
Umpire O'Day. who fairly overhung
the vase, called the third out and the
ending of the game.
Boston There in Pinch.
It was a climax that showed the
resources and strength of Boston
when under pressure. But is was n'.t
the only exhibition of a similar na
ture. Righttielder Harry Hooper un
covered the individual play of the day
in the fourth inning when he made
a great running catch of Cutshaw'j
twisting fly and nipped Wheat trying
to score from third. The ball loft
Cntshaw's bat as if undecided where
it was going and Hooper had to sprint
well over toward the ftml just ba.k
of the first base before he could get
his hands on it.
Many Thrills.
The effort caused him to slip t.i the
turf in a sitting position, .but he m as
up like a flash and. while still rising,
hurled the bull straight to Cady. The
latter slamemd it on West's ankle as
he reached for the plate with his
foot at the end of the perfect hiAik
