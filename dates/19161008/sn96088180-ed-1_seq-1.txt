English War Lord Says That
No Proposal Has Cce
Fro Germany, asd Tbt
War Must Go to Knocked
London, Oct. 7. "We have re
ceived no German peace overtures as
yet, but ' Mr. Lloyd-George, In his
statement to the United Press has
given our views on peace at this
time."
This statement from Lord Robert
Cecil, minister of war trade, today re
flected the attitude of British official
sentiment toward the latest report
from the United States that Ambassa
dor Qerard Is bekrlng a peace mes
sage from the kaiser to President Wil
son.
Everywhere In official circles Lloyd
George's emphatic declaration that
the war most go on "to a knockout,"
was cited as the answer to the newest
pence rumors. There is no doubt
that Lloyd-George voiced the senti
ment of every Briton, at least In ex
pressing the nation's determination
tq finish the war In a proper manner.
- Reports similar to those received
from America have reached here from
Scandinavia regarding the purpose of
Gerard's visit. . They are not confirm
ed, but they created no surprise in
official circles. In fact, it has been
generally'belleved by British officials
that the Germans would send a peace
kite flying In October. The Lloyd
George declaration waa consequently
considered timely, forestalling a pos
sible move by neutrals.
It was strongly emphasised today
that any suggestions of mediation
coming from President Wilson at this
time wonld not be acceptable. Well
Informed persons added, ' however,
that there would be no objection It
President Wilson merely acted as an
agent In transmitting any terms the
kaiser cares to offer.
The evening newspapers comment
guardedly today upon . the , reports
from America. Balanced opposite
these stories they print In large black
type significantexcerpts from Lloyd
George's statement to . the United
Press warning nentrala to keep hands
off.

Yesterday at noon the big whistle
at the sugar factory sounded its call
to the workmen for the first time.
With fires nnder the boilers and
steam up, the factory begins to take
on the hum of activity, and several
of the machines have already been

Oil burners are being placed under
four.of the sets of boilers, while the

This change was made because of
some trouble in getting sufficient
wood cut at a pyce that would allow
It to compete with-the oil as a fuel.
The pumps were .also started up

YET READY TO

Second, the political situation In
the country has aroused to a marked
degree partisan feeling tor one or the
other or the warring sides. It hss
resulted In stirring up a , reeling
abroad thatUhe United States Is not
strictly neutral, and as President Wil
son ' recently said In an address at
Shadow l.awn, this feeling has reach
ed a point where even diplomatic In-'
tercourse between this country and
foreign nations will be seriously em
barrassed until after November 7, be
cause "foreign diplomats 'are wall
ing to see what would be the outcome
of the election." '
Perhaps no exiireaslon by the pre
sident In recent months has aroused
so much conjecture here as that In
Omaha Thursday night, when he said?
"When we look forward to the
years to come I wish I could say te
months to come and to the end of
this war, we want the world tq know
we are ready to lend our force to
the preservation of pence.",

STEAMER MERCIAN SHELLED
'BY GERMAN SUBMARINE
Galveston, Oct. 7 The Leyland
steamer Mercian, which arrive here
today, reported being shelled by a
German submarine tear the coast of
England. Captain O. J. Walker ex
hibited a rap the visor of which had
been split by a shell splinter as he
stood on the bridge. There were no
fatalities or material damage to the
steamer, which was saved by the ap
pearance of British warships. .
Indicative that the president feels the
end of the war may be far 'off and
also that he feels the work of Amer
ica will be to preserve the peace of
the future, not to Intervene now.
From those close to the president
comes the word that he knows noth
ing regarding a report that Ambas
sador Gerard Is bringing with him to
this country A request of the German
government tn Intercede In belialt of
pence. But there Is a strong belief
In official circles here that the presi
dent will consider no further move,
either dlroctly or Indirectly, toward
offering his' gqod offices unless such
a plea Is made openly by one or more
or tho belligerent nations. .
