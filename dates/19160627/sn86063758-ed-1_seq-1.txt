liOlS ARE CHEERFUL A>D
READY MA'RCHISG ORDERS

Spends Sunday at Styx?Bullock
Boys Cheerful.
"Lives there the man, "with soul so
dead,
Who never to himself hath said,
-< *This is my own, my native land.'
If such there breathe, eo mark him
well.
For him, no minstrel raptures swell."
If this sentiment prevailed and if
the shameful and cowardly declaration,
"1 did not raise my boy to be a j
soldier" dominated the spirit of:
American citizenship, there would be I
no uniformed soldier boys on the

for that matter, anywhere else in the
union, and a giant among the nations '
of the earth would be the helpless
victim of murderous bandits and invading
armies of a nation entirely1
void of all moral restraint and "whose
government is one of tumultuous and
seething anarchy.
In the present Mexican situation
v there are three possibilities as to the
outcome. First, war may yet be
avoided by diplomatic maneuvering
and the National Guards sent home.
Second, the rapid mobUization on
the border and the sending into Mexico
of an immense and overwhelming
army, such as would overcome and
^ terrify the entire population,?political
leaders, generals, presidents and
all?would no doubt bring this war !
distracted people to their senses, or!
at leastf. to a realization, in a meas- ;
ure, of their danger, and hence bring 1
about early negotiations for peace, j
Third, in case of the failure of the !
first two possibilities, it is likely that,!
after the few pitched battles between ;
* regularly organized armies the war1
"will develop into a guerilla warfare !
which may last several years.
Of course there can be no doubt as j
to the final result, if the war is to be
fought between the United States and Mexico
without the aid of powerful
allies on the side of i\!exico; and even
in that event, if the soldier 'boys at
<Styx is a fair sample of the courage
and physical vigor of other soldiers i
all over this great country, the outcome |
even against great odds, would be
one of final victory.
The reporter with a few friends
motored to Columbia and visited the
camp grounds at Styx last Sunday. It
$ was all very interesting and full of
the thrills of martial life. As our little
party was strolling about the
grounds, we encountered a sentry
who suddenly 'brought his rifle, whicn
looke<i as Dig as a ience ran, irom ui-o
shoulder and with the stock under his
arm and his fingers on the trigger;
works, with the muzzle net more |
than six feet from the foremost man
in our bunch, he commanded us to
"halt." fWe halted. We didn't slowdown
like some of the auto drivers
in Newt>e?~y when they see a "stop"
sign. We stopped or "halted" so
suddenly that we almost stripped our
gears.
"Where are you going?'' was the
P next siern demand.
We pointed to our auto which wa?
standing a short distance away and !
stammered out in broken and unin- <
telligible sentences that we were trying
to depart, that while we had enjoyed
cur short stay in the camp, we j
i felt that the enjoyment might sub- j
side if we stayed any great length i
I
of time. Good bye!
We hunted up the ever genial and j
cordial Bullock boys?Glenn and I
Earle, who belong to the Anderson
company. Earle already belonged to
^ the Anderson organization and when
& the call was made for the National
to mobilize. Glenn went with
his brother from Newberry to An- j
derson and joined the s^me company, j
When seen at their tent they were
very cheerful and spoke with pride
of their company, saying that it was
the largest in the First regiment?
LI50 men. While we were seated in
their tent, which is also- occupied hy
^^eral of their comrades, an officer

rIK. W. T. BLFORD 1> NO
DANGER FROM RABBIES
Mr. W. T. Buford of the Bush river
church community returned Saturday
morning from Columbia> in good spirits,
the physician in charge of the
pasteur treatment for rabbies having
assured him that he was in no danger
from the wound on his hand
sustained while placing in close confinement
a dog which he thought to
be mad.
? - ? r%.. f
Last Friday morning Mr. ouiuiu
and his son Willie Munson noticed
one of their dogs acting strange and
as the day passed his behavior growing
more suspicious they decided to
shut him up in the buggy house and
await developments. It was while i
clinching a nail on the inside. Mr.
Buford having reached his hand
through a crack with the hammer, j
that the dog came forward and at-1
tempted to lick Mr. Buford's hr?id |
which he quickly snatched away, and, j
in -doing so he snagged it slightly on i
another protruding nail point. (Mr.
Buford feared that some of the deadly
virus might have gotten into the
wound and after having Dr. Pope
cauterize the wound he took t'ne dog's
head and went to Columbia Friday
night. The head was examined and
it was found that the dog had rabbies
?a very decided case.
As stated before. Mr. Buford was
informed that he was in no danger
and returned to Newberry.

The Styx grounds cover several i

ity. 1
Fell information from American
sources as to what happened at Car- j (
rizal was still lacking and the long *
delay in finding additional survivors | 1
of the fight was regarded as an omi- J
nous sign. No American officer may j J

Xo offers of mediation reached the
state department. Administration of- j
ficials hold that they have nothing to J,
mediate. Tt is generally regarded as I
unlikely that President Wilson would j ;
agree to anything tying the hands of j,
Gen. Funston. I
Under these circumstances it was j
intimated on high authority that ef- j 1

concerning the initiation of which the ^
minister of Salvador was authorized j
today to confer with his diplomatic i
colleagues, could go no further than 1J
an attempt to.persuade Gen. Carranza !
to change his attitude toward the de- (
termination of the United States to
protect its people and territory.
Ambassador Xaon of Argentine is j'
understood to have advised his government
last night that the circumstances
did not lend themselves to
a mediation proposal at this time. He
came here yesterday from New York ^
and saw diplomatic and state depart- ,
ment officials and returned to Washington
