Washington, June 27.—There were
clear indications today that if American
cavalrymen captured-by Mexldan troops
"yat Carrizal were not released within
forty-elghl hours, action would be
taken by the United States.
igfj- The impression prevailed here that
the president would not wait beyond
Thursday at the latest and possibly not
beyond tomorrow afternoon for a reply
from the Carranza government to the
note demanding, the release at once of
thd prisoners and a declaration of pol

Push War Preparations.
Special Agent Rodgers at iMexlco City
reported in an over-night message he
bad delivered the note to the foreign
office yesterday morning.
While t'ne dipiomatio aspect of thct

The president's first steps, should he
f-^.force the issue, probably would be to
lay- the stiuation before congress in
joint session.
Expect Surrender of Prisoners.
Mexican officials here have expressed
the opinion that £arranza would sur
render the prisoners whatever reply he
made to the demand for -a formal
dipiomatio expression of his purposes.
The state, department has had no re
pbrt tending to confirm this view.
Every day's delay in what seems the
inevitable break in relations sees the
army in better position for the swift
.action that may follow. This has in
.fluenctd against pressing matters to an
immediate lscue.
Advices from General Funston lndi

Funston and his staff searched every
report from all border stations today

censorship soon would be in force.

ADMITS HIS ILLEGAL
RELATIONS WITH GIRL
Ssys He Did Not Fall in Love With
Miss Lambert Until Relations Had
Existed Some Time—Prepared Medi
cine For Her to "Relieve Her Mind"
—Defendant Compelled to Undergo
Rigid Cross Examination.
Waukegan, June 27.—Will H. Orpet,
charged witlf the murder of Marian
Lambert, resumed the- stand today. At
torney Ralph E. Potter, of the defense,
at once asked about the water and
molasses which Orpet sent to Marian
to "relieve her mind." One of the bot
tles he sent, the other he brought to
her Feb. 9, the day of her death.
"I bought the bottle of six ounce
-Size of Otto Peterson, and filled it two
thirds full in my room," he said. He
said yesterday that Marian, when he
met her in the woods, refused to accept
It, saying, "That will not do me any
good."
Orpet was In better voice than yes
terday. He talked with more assur
ence and more connectedly.*
"Why did you tell State's Attorney
Dady that you were a't Madison o«i
Feb. 9?" asked Mr. Potter.
"Well, the way things were I thought
it would look bad," replied the boy.
Every ear was strained as Attorney
Potter asked:
"What were your relations with Ce
leste Youker?'
."There was a tacit ,^nderstandinK,
between us., had known ^her"" six
-yeM-s.*"***'" 1
"Did she return your affections?"
"Yes."
"At all times?"
"Not always."
"You were engaged?"
"No, there was an understanding. No
date was set for marriage. I had not
even formally asked her to marry me."
Denies Interview.
Mr. Potter next asked concerning
certain answers Orpet was reported to
have-made to reporters at the time of
his arrest The principal one was this:
"Did you tell Mr. Dady or any one
else that you saw Marian take poison?"
"No, I did not."
"Did you tell reporters that Mariai»
the othqr girls of humble parentage
felt flattered at the attentions of col
lege men?"
"I certainly did not."
State Cross Examines.
The witness was turned over to the
state for cross examination. Interroga*
tion for the state was by Attorney
David R. Joslin,- who is assisting
State's Attorney Dady. He asked about
an auto ride which Marian and Orpet
took last September.
It was on thi^ trip that the relations
between the young pair passed the
bounds of morality, witness admitted.
"You stopped and went into the
woods?" asked Mr. Joslin.'
"Yes."
"Take a blanket with you?"
"What did you say to Marian?"
"I can't remember."
"Well, make a guess."
"I can't guess, as that would be in
dependent of any real memory."
"O, you were desperately In love
with her, weren't you?"
VNot then, that came later, judging
from my letters."
"You can hot remember independe d.
of the letters how your love devel
oped?"
"No sir." '.vr
Mr. Joslin called attention to a let
ter which the defendant wrote to
Marian last September in which he
said:
"This kind of weather makes me
think of fussing."
"What do you mean by 'fussing?'"
asked iMr. Joslin.
'Tt means paying attention to a girl,"
explained Orpet.
•Mr. Joslin asked about OrpetJs re
turn from the university in June a
year ago and having called on Marian.
'TOer parents were there always*
but sometimes stayed after they had
•gone to bed,!' said Orpet.
"Nothing happened at this time
which the parents might not have
seen?" asked Mr. Joslin.
•iNo sir."
Testimony Shames Woman.
For a half hour questions and an
swers were of a nature at which wo
men hung their heads and men were
plainly uncomfortable, but iMr. Joslin
went on relentlessly. The young
witness, faced by his father and moth
er. turned his head as he replied to
the questions. There was a sigh of
relief as "exhibit one"—a letter from
Orpet to (Marian, was called to the
witness stand.

ment for the night interrupted the re
ctal which will be resumed Tuesday.
He did. not see her take poison, nor
have it about her, he .testified, but he
saw her dying convulsions. He sup
ported 'the theory that the cyanide of
potassium which caused her death was
taken in powdered form, and not in a
solution as Insisted by expert toxicolo
glsts called by the prosecution.
Noticed Powder on Face.
'1 noticed a white powder oh her
fade and one hand," he said.
The "medicine" which he gave her
to relieve a supposed delicate condi
tion, he said,'was simply molasses and
water. He said that he knew she could
not be enciente, and adopted this sub
terfuge to relieve her mind, as she
kept insisting in letters that she was
alarmed at her condition.
At the meeting in the woods he said
Marian expressed alarm ai her con
dition and he tried to persuade her
that her fears were groundless. He
offered her the molasses and water to

refused it, saying that it was useless.

LITTLE INTEREST IN
TRIAL OF CASEMENT
Prosecution Suddenly Rests Its Case
After Lunch Today and Prisoner's
Counsel Opens by Declaring Offense
Can Not. Be Tried in Great Britain.
London, June 27.—The second day of
the trial' ot Sir Roger Casement for
high treason opened today with no
change of the apathetic attitude with
which the general public regards the
case." The principal reason oiTered for
^this lack of interest is 'that-the atten
tion of coubitry. is iocused on the
oottflhei^t.
The prisoner'was in a cheerful- frame
of mind as he'came ii»~to the dock,
altho he showed little of the jauntiness
shown at the preliminary examination.
The testimonial witnesses were the
same as those called at the prelimi
nary hearings and few new points were
brought out during the early proceed
ings.
The prosecution rested suddenly af
ter the luncheon recess, and the at
torney general said lie had no state
ment to make.
Counsel for Casement at once began
an address in an attempt to have the
Indictment quashed. He argued that
the alleged treasonable acts were com
mitted outside of the British realm and
could not foe tried in Great Britain.
MILITIA BILL PASSES SENATE.
Provision Calling For Pay For Fam
ilies Finally Eliminated.
Washington, June 27.—After one of
the most stirring debates in a decade
the senate last night passed the Hay
resolution declaring the existence of
an emergency in the relations of the
United Sta/tes and Mexico and author
izing the president to draft the na
tional guard into tlfte federal service
for such use as he may Care to put it
to to meet the situation.
Just prior to the passage-of the reso
lution Senator Sherman of Illinois of
fered an amendment to the effect that,
instead of an emergency, "a state of
war exists between the United States
and the de facto government of Mex
ico."
The offering of this amendment
raised a commotion In the senate such
as has not been seen in many years.
Wilson Men Accept Gage.
Administration leaders leaped from
their seats to remonstrate with the
Illir.oisan and to urge him to withdraw
his motion.
Republicans who had been insisting
thruoyt the debate that a state of war
existed became panic stricken when
Senator Sherman put it squarely up to
them to vote the way they talked.
After wrangling for nearly an hour
the senate voted down the Sherman
amendment without a roll call. Then
It passed the emergency resolution
with a provision Instructing the secre
tary of war to accept the resignations
of any national guardsmen who have
families dependent on them for sup
port and who wish to resign.
Bar Pay For Families.
Senators Lewis of Illinois, Reed of
Missouri, Hitchcock of Nebraska, and
Smith of Georgia made an Ineffectual
effort to have the measure approved
as It passed the house, providing pay
of $50 a month for the dependent fam
ilies of guardsmen. They were beaten,
30 to 45.
A motion of Senator Lewis to give
the guardsmen a chance to resign or
serve with pay for his family, as he
chose, was defeated, 17 to 58.N
The resolution, as amended by the
senate, now goes back to the house,
where it is said the leadera_wlll insist
upon the pay for the guardsmen fea
ture which was beaten In the senate
today. A deadlock is likely to result,
to break when President Wilson prob
ably will be called upon for assistance,
Wf, Rush Order For Ammunition.
Philadelphia, June 27.—A rush or
der for 20,000,000 rounds of small arms
ammunition was being .filled at one of
the government arsenals here today.
The cartridges will be Consigned to the
