the effect that here after all employes,

treatment of employes received at

Roehl wasn't a ut backward about
explaining the reason for the "ad?to

"The Queen's hospital has been the
goat so long in this compensation

receiving only a small part of .the

on we will not take cases if payment

To Treat Desperate Cases.
Roehl says the Queen's hospital
Will certainly not refuse desperate or
serious cases, but the ordinary acci
dent and fracture kind will be turned
back to the emergency hospital if not
accompanied by the required guaran
tee from the employer.
