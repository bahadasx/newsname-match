Take the Federal Oath and
the Dick Law.
Washington, June 26. Efforts to
ward Latin-American mediation in the
Mexican crisis, favored by Carranza
official i, collapsed today without hav
ing r vched the stage of a formal pro
posal to the United States.
It was made plain by Secretary
Lannlm? to Ignacio Calderon, minister
of Bolivia, who called with the inten
tion of asking whether the United
States would entertain an offer of the
services of its southern neighbors to
aid in avoiding war, that the Wash
ington government sees nothing in the
present situation that would warrant
arbitration proceedings.
Lansing Blames Carranza.
Mr. Lansing talked with the minis
ter for half an hour and is under
stood to have told him that the blame
tor the grave outlook rested squarely
Upon General Carranza. The attitude
of th .United States was so fully out
lined that Mr. Calderon did not men
tion directly the original purpose of
his visit. ' .. ' .'
Not to Tender Good Offices. IV...
V.'hen the minintr lft the state de
partment he said the time seemed m
opuportune and that for the present
the -diplomatic representatives of six
fr-"outh and Central American countries
who had approached the Mexican em
bassy on the subject of mediation and
received assurances that the Carranza,
government was favorable to the prin
ciple, would not tender their good of
fices to the United States. He indi
cated that the attempt to arrange me
diation might -be renewed if General
Carranm's reply to Secretary Lans
ing's last note furnished any basis on
- which the proposal could be founded.
Waiting for Carranza" Final Word.
The United States now is waiting
' for Carranfca's final word in reply o
the note sent yesterday demanding re
lease of the prisoners taken at Carrl
sal and a formal diplomatic announce
- nvnt of intentions.
The note reached Mexico City ' late
last night. Special Agent Rodgers re
ported its receipt, adding that he had
failed in his first efforts to place it
in the hands of the Carranza minister
of foreign relations. Undoubtedly it
was delivered today. Officials looked
for an answer within a day or two at
most.
Precautionary 8tps Taken.
Meanwhile both congress and the
war department put new urgency Into
their preparations for war.- There
were Indications that should a formal
break occur toward the end of the
week, every possible precautionary
step will have been taken and General
Kunston will be in a position to de
fend the border adequately and rein
force Pershing's expedition, although
argresslve action may , be delayed
somewhat.
War Department Activities.
War" department activities during
the day covered a wide field. Supple
mental orders to departmental com
manders called for greater haste - in
getting the national guard to the bor
der. Authorization went out to ac
' cept the men under the physical ex
aminations on which they entered the
state service, postponing final exami
rat:on until they are enroute or have
reachpd the border. Those found un
fit will be sent back at once.

tak'thope'memDer' of ' the militia
whose enlistments under the Dick law
had three months or less to run. - The
federal authorities had' decided that it
was not economy to take these men
for so short a time and then, have to
6 end them back. These men who have
only a brief term to serve will remain
in camp here until their enlistments
expire. .
. Dick Law Men sorted out.
To avoid an admixture of militia
men who have not taken the oath with
those who were-sworn in for three
years, battalion officers sorted out the
Dick law men and filled in their places
with others. The explanation was that
the officers did not with to jeopardize
the rating of their commands when
they get south by having men dis-
charge because of expiration of enlist
ment. -As each company is only
men, the officers were able to get
enough men to nil their ranks with
those who had sworn in for three
years. - Many veteran militiamen will
not have to go, as they gave way to
younger men.
