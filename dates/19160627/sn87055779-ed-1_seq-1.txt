spirit is sweeping the border today.
From the gulf of Mexico to the Pa

troops are both alert for the signal
to enter conflict.
The actual situation is shown by
an occurrence near Progresso, 40
miles from Hrawnsville, 'ast night.
Two armed Mexicans who attempted
to cross the Pio Grande were fired
upon by an American border patrol,
one of the Mexicans was killed and
another wounded.
Along the Kio Grande near San
P.enito. Mexican soldiers have con
centrated for a s- dden clash Into
American territory. On the Arizona
border Carranzista forces are threat
ening the towns of Naco. Pisbee and
Xogales. A special train is carrying"
American troops to the menaced
Arizona front.

thinly guarded Ariz.ona line far out

Awaiting Wnnl.
Officers and men cheerfully await

would bring them into actual war.
The big "four point sevens' on Cot

eagerly into their positions. There
was a new briskness in all camps.
It may he said without revealing
a military secret that the America!
artillerymen have reckoned the
exact range of every importan.
square foit of Juarez territory. The
Mexicans have threatened to bom
bard Fl Paso and have said that
they will topple over pome of th?
tall buildings before Juarez is taken.
"I'll give their guns one shot
apiece if they tire luickly, said an
artillery ofTicer. "after that we'll
have their batteries out of business.
The best tactical move a Mexican
force ever made was when the
Juarez garrison evacuated. For them
to remain in Juarez mean that they
will die there."

Machine gun crews wer near the
international bridge ready t sweep
a path for the advance across that

FOUT HATtrrtSON. Ind.. June 21.
The Indiana national guard was
one day nearer the call for service
at the Mexican border today. Mus
tering officers and examining physi
cians doubled their efforts to com
plete the last details necessary be
fore reporting the guard was ready
to move.
The held artillery was on edge
again today awaiting- the call. Jtu
mors yesterday were that it would
he called today. When it was learn
ed today that Capt. J. J. Toffey,
mustering officer, had received a
telegram saying that "imperative
military necessity" demanded haste
it completing the organization of
the guard, the battery boys pre
pared to entrain tomorrow or Thurs
day. The infantry was d rilled steadily
in camp today. Many of the men
are recruits and the guard officers
are exerting every effort to whim
them into shape. New companies
which have been raised in at least
five cities, are expected to arrive
within the next day or two, increas
ing the infantry in camp hy 500. Py
the end of the week the entire guard
will be ready for call to service.
i ho mi:n today.
The tin soldiers of yesterday have
become the iron men of tomorrow
in Indiana, and. grim-faced, some of
them will v.-ave farewells perhaps
within twenty-four hours, that will
not be an revoirs. They will be
good-bye?, forever.
Co. F.. third regiment, will be
among the first to leave- probably
Thursday.
For It is to b. no child's play, war
in Mexico. And, as of yore, when
the names of Hoosiers "dug them
selves in" to niches in the; immortal
halls of the nation's famous, so will
the striplings, who today took their
first, faltering lessons in warcraft at
Fort Benjamin Harrison, have their
chances for a place hi the sun of
history.
As often as a crisis faces the na
tion, the natTonal guard, reviled and
laughed at in the days of peace,
buckles on its shard of American
ism and goes forth to be the back
hone of the nation's strength. They
are quiet, in the main, out at Fort
Pen ja min Harrison. There are
mothers and fathers and sweethearts
and sons and laughing daughters out
there, too, to see their loved ones.
And nearly all of the forced smiles
in the bronzed faces beyond baker's
bridge are used solely and charily
for those sane mothers and fathers
and sweethearts and sons and laugh
ing daughters.
Selects leaders.
ever at the statehouse a judicial
man sat Monday and used all his
cunning and all his judgment, a, he
selected the officers- of the troops
from Indiana. For. if he has made
a mistake there, it will be his cost
liest. For the men he named will,
in !arge part, hold within their hands
the lives of four thousand Hooslers.
Arid captives of the Mexicans seldom
are released.
Northern Indian, got its share of
those appointments. And northern
Indiana troops, out at Fort Harrison,
were happy in the belief that the
men named to lead them to the bor
der, would be found not wanting in
the hours of quick decisions.
The artillery probably will go
first from Camp Palst m. With

WASHINGTON, June 27. Convinced that Pres't Wilson will
within 48 hours demand congressional sanction for a break with
Mexico, house leaders this afternoon framed a tentative draft of a
resolution to accomplish that purpose. After a careful review of
four war resolutions, the leaders decided to submit to the presi
dent a proposal which would declare, "through the acts of the
Mexican government, a state of war exists between the
United States and Mexico." Rep. Flood, chairman of the house
foreign affairs committee, Rep. Harrison of Mississippi, an admin
istration leader, and Acting Chairman Pou of the house rules com
mittee, all worked on the resolution. The proposed declaration
would follow almost word for word the resolution which sent Zach
ary Taylor on his victorious campaign in northern Mexico, and
Winifield Sccit from Vera Cruz to Mexico City, in 1846. While
not a flat declaration of war it would place the burden of the "ex
