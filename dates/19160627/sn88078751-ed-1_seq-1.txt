Chicago, Juno 26. Former Presi
dent Theodore Roosevelt, In a letter
to the Progressive national commit
tee, which convened hero today, com
municated his reasons for declining
the Progressive nomination lor presi
dent of the United States.
The high spots in the colonel's let
ter are the writer's expressed adher
ence to Progressive principles, the
condemnation of the Wilson adminis
tration and Indorsement of Charles E.
Hughes, Republican nominee for pres
ident. Mr. Roosevelt also took occa
sion to rap the German-American al
liance. The Progressive committeemen are
In session to act on the declination
of Roosevelt to head the national
ticket.
George W. Perkins, chairman of the
the national convention; John M. Par
ker or New Orleans, the vice presi
dential nominee; John W. McGrath,
Colonel Roosevelt's secretary; Ma
th ew Hale of Massachusetts, 'L. O.
Engen of North Dakota, William
Plinn of Pittsburgh, Dr. E. M. Harris
of Rhode Island and groups of other.?
from the east and south are attending
the meeting.
Mr. Roosevelt In his letter said:
Tho platform put forth In 191! was
much thp moat Important public docu
ment promulgated In fills country since
the denth of Abraham Lincoln. No finer
effort wns ever made to serve tho Amer
ican people, In a spirit of high loyalty
to all that Is loftiest In the American
tradition. With all my heart I shall con
tinue to work for thesn great ideals,
shoulder to shoulder with the men and
women who In 1912 championed them
Much has been accomplished In awaken
ing the public to a better understanding
of the problems of social and Industrial
welfare. Yet It has become entirely el

ditions aro not prepared to accept a new
party.
Nomination of Hughes.
It Is Impossible for us Progressives to
abandon our convictions r.ut wo are
faced with the fact that as things actual
ly are tho Progressive national organiza
tion no longer offers the means whereby
we can male these convictions tffectlvo
In our national life. Under such circum
stances our duty I to do the best wo
can, and not to sulk because our leader
ship Is rej'rtcd.
In my judgment, the nomination of Mr.
Hughe,s meets the conditions set forth In
the statement of the Progressive national
committee, Issued last January, and In
my own statements. Under existing con
ditions, tho nomination of a third ticket
would, In my Judgment w moiely a mn)

whosi public record Is a guarantee that
he will not merely stand for a program
of clean-cut. stralghtnut Americanism be

good fnlth put It through If elected.
Ho Is bevond nil comparison better fitted
to ho president than Mr. Wilson. It
would be a grave detriment to tho coun
try to re-elect Mr. Wilson. I shall, there

that the attitude 'of these professional

were bound to rtcfeat me for nomination.
I need hnrdlv repent what I have already

Mr. Roosevelt then attacks the Dem
ocratic administration's foreign poli
cies. Ho charged the administration
had been ciiilty of shortcomings
"more signal than those of any ad
ministration -since the days of Buch
anan." He assailed Wilson's attitude
in both the European war and the
Moxlcan troubles, alleging feebleness
on the part of the president.
The colonel expresses opposition
to a third party ticket at this time
and adds:
I do not believe that Mr. Hughes woull
have been nominated If It bnd not been
for the fight on behalf of public decency
mid efficiency which the Progressive par
ty has waged during the past four years.
Mr. Wilson has been tried and found
wanting. Mr. Hughes has shown In his
career the Instinct of efficiency whlcn
vs. in guarantee that, under him. the gov
ernment will once more work with vigor
nnd force.
WILSON WON'T. DISCUSS
MEDIATION PROPOSAL
Gail For Volunteers Anticipated
at National Capital,
Washington, June 26. President
Wilson had a lengthy conference with
Chairman Stone of the senate commit
tee on foreign relations and Chairman
Flood of the house committee on for
eign affairs. He gave the congress
leaders a complete description of the
Mexican crisis and outlined the
course which tho government may ho
expected to follow in the next few
days. The salient points In the preS'
ident's policy are:
The United States will not discuss
proposals for mediation of the diffi
culties between the United States and
Mexico so long as the relations be
tween the two republics remain In
their present status. Tho president
considers affairs have reached tbo
stage where the honor and dignity of
the United States, are widely Involved.
The president does not Intend to
go before congress before a declara
tion of war appears to be next logical
step for this government. He con
siders that he has acted entirely with
in the limitations of his executive
prerogatives in making the uncondi
tional demand upon Carranza for tho
release of the seventeen soldiers Im
prisoned at Chihuahua City. He will
ask authority of congress to call for
an adequate number of volunteers as
soon as diplomatic means of keeping
the peace with Mexico have been ex
hausted. Many officials believe that
this eventuality will havo to be faced
before the week-end and they have
every reason to believe that the pres
ident is mentally prepared for it.

NOTES ARE
EXCHANGED
By United States With Car
ranza Government
Latter Assumes Responsibility
For Attack at Carrizal.
RELEASEOFAMERICANSSOUBHT
6ecretary Lansing Demands Early
Statement From the Head of the Do
Facto Government as to the Course
of Action He Has Determined Upon.
Aggressive Action Delayed by Lack
of Troops On the Border.
Washington, June 26. Full respon
sibility for the at'ack on the Ameri
can forces at Carrizal has been as
sumed by the Carranza government.
Demand for the immediate release
of the American troopers captured in
the engagement has been made by
tho American government with a fur
ther demand for an early statement
from Carranza as to the course of ac
tion lie has determined upon.
These are the outstanding features
of communications exchanged be
tween the two governments made pub
lic by Secretary of State Lansing.
Representative of the Latin-American
republic in Washington are con
ferrlng with a view to preparing a
combined proposal for mediation as a
means of preventing a break. The
Mexican embassy has been unofficial
ly advised that General Carranza has
accepted "in principle" a tentativo
proposal to this and received by him
from other Latin-American republics.
The United States is still to be ap
proached formally on the subject. Offf
clals here Intimate that the proposal
would be rejected.
The course followed up to this tima
compels the conclusion that the ad
ministration, finding its hands more
or less tied by the slowness with
which the national guard Is mobiliz
ing for muster, is endeavoring to play
for time. This was indicated in sig
nal fashion in the reply sent to the
Carranza note accepting full responsi
bility for the Carrizal affair.
Lansing's Note.
At the receipt of tho reply Secre
tary Lansing instructed James Linn
Rodgers. special representative of the
United States at Mexico City, to In
form the Mexican foreign office that
"the government of the United States
can put no other construction on tue
Carranza communication, other than
it was intended for a formal avowal
of deliberately hostile action against
the forces of the United States now
In Mexico."
Then, after demanding the release
of the prisoners held at Chihuahua,
Secretary Lansing directs Mr. Rod
gers to inform the Mexican foreign
office that "the government of the
United States expects an early state
ment from your government as to tho
course of action It has determined
upon, and that It also expects that
this statement be made through the
usual diplomatic channels, and not
through subordinate military com
manders." There Is no suggestion In the Amer
ican communication as to the course
of action the United States has de
termined upon in view of Carranza's
admission of responsibility for the at
tack on the American troopers.
Inasmuch as any aggressive action
determined upon would require the re
lease of all the regular army forcea
now held on the border for use in
Mexico, no move can be initiated until
a sufficient number of national
guardsmen Is sent to take up the bor
der patrol work. While this serious
aspect of the problem Is believed to
be the occasion In great measure for
the hesitation of the president, th
possibility that Carranza may at any
time order his forces to attack Per
shing is becoming a matter of grow
ing concern to army officers, particu
larly In view of the persistent reports
that General Trevlno, the Mexican
commander, is concentrating a force
of 30,000 at points commanding Per
shing's headquarters and line of com
munications. Unofficial reports reached here that
Pershing's main force was engaged in
battle with a Carranza army.
It developed that Secretary Daker
has sent out urgent orders to the de
partmental commanders to redouble
their efforts to muster in the national
guard and to rush organizations to
the border as rapidly as possible. The
department was informed that the
militia of Kansas, Missouri and Call
'ornla were mustered in Saturday.
