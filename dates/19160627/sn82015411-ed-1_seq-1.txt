Lihue, Kauai,
June 23, 1916.
Editor Gaudun Island:
A letter from Hon. Eric A.
Knudsen in last week's Garden
Island may Rive many people a
wrong impression of the attitude
of the committee of ladies which
called on him in relation to the
failure of the Department ot Edu
cation to continue Mr. and Mrs.
II. C. Brown as teachers. Noth
ing was farther from the minds of
those concerned than to raise any
factional feeling between different
localities on Kauai or to attack
any official. The letter of the
Honorable Commissioner misrep
resents absolutely the interview
between himself and the commit
tee. It has seemed to many that to
lose two of the best teachers of
Kauai suddenly, without any an
nounced reason, was wrong and
this interview was 'to ask the rea
sons for the department's action
and to ask the commissioner to ar
range for a rehearing. Mr. Knud
sen says that he told the commit
tee of ladies that he would take
the matter up again with the de
partment, but the committee un
derstood him to make the opposite
statement. Therefore, with this
understanding they helped to cir
culate a petition to the governor
to have Mr. and Mrs. Brown re
tained in the department. We
ask you to publish this petition
with the names subscribed. It
will show the nature and the in
tention of the movement to have
the Browns retained and it will
also show that it is not local, but
includes name of people from
Kekaha to Wainiha.
Yours very truly,
Anna C. Wilcox,
Dora R. Isknbhrg,
Helen E. Lydgatk,
Elsie H. Wilcox,

TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE
GOVERNOR OE THE TERRI
TORY OF HAWAII:
We the undersigned residents
of the County ot Kauai beg to
draw your attention to the follow
ing petition:
We learn with regret and appre
,jf.nsion that the Department of
Public Instruction has failed to
reappoint Mr. a n d Mrs. Brown
to their positions in the Waimea
School, or to any other position in
the department.
We feel that grave injustice has
been done Mr. and Mrs. Brown by
this action of the Department, and
would hereby respectfully request
that the Department reconsider its
action in this matter, with a view
to a more equitable treatment of
these teachers of long standing
and proven ability. It is wc be
lieve a matter of fact beyond con
troversy that they have given
themselves with untiring industry
and devotion to the interests of
their school; and mistakes have
been the result of their anxious
desire to further its wellbeing,
We deplore the harshness of
treatment shown toward Mr
Brown, the principal, on com
plainU made against Mrs. Brown,
and while in no way disposed to
excust a failure to obey the in
structions ot tne Department, as
charged against Mrs. Brown, we
feel that a reprimand and a warn
i ing would have been adequate

FAREWELL DINNER
TO MR. MiLLIKEN
Frulav evening the Knudsen
home, Kekaha, was the scene of a
very pretty dinner given in honor
of Rev. C. D. Milliken. who is
leaving shortly for the coast.
The dinner was served on the
spacious lanai, amid an artistic
setting of palms and ferns.
A unique feature was the huge
square banqueting table, the dec
orations of which consisted wholly
of long spiays of golden shower,
and an exquisite carving of Floren
tine marble, indicating the place
of the guest of honor. Dainty
place card of pale yellow carried
out the same color scheme. Soft
ly colored lanterns were suspend
ed among the greenerv, while
shaded candles helped to give a
fairy-like touch to the charming
ensemble.
The occasion was the motif for
numerous speeches and toasts to

admit that local conditions and
prejudices at times justify the De

to some other position in order to
bring about harmonious relations
in a community, and we would
respectfully request that if, in the
opinion of the Department, it may
injure such harmonious relations
between the school and the com
inunity to reappoint Mr, and Mrs
Brown to the Waimea School, they
be transferred on the merits of
their excellent work, to some oth
