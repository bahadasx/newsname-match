THEIR GREAT ADVENTURE
By Mabel Abbott.
\ "Once to every man worth while," said J. J. Hill,
"comes the Great Adventure. The Great Northern
. was mine."
"Why fear death," said Charles Frohman, "It is
the most beautiful adventure in life."
With no striking words, perhaps, but with a spring
in their step and a light in their eyes, the men in khaki
at American Lake will fare forth, probably in a day
or two, to their Great Adventure.
Every man in the uniform has made his decision;
and it is as great a decision to them as that which

Hush the Warehouse.
Half of the attacking force .en
tered the S|it'rry plant from the
bluff above the mill, rushing
through the mill, striking down
warehousemen, and running alone;
the overhead dock approaches to
the grain chutes leading to the
Santa Cruz.
At the same lime anitier mob

a high fence at llie end of the
mill warehouse, and rush-.d upon
the wharves. Three poll'.emen on
guard were overwhelmed by the
mob.
Hand-to-hand fighting took
place ln the warehouse, on ihe
flock, and on the decks and holds
of the ship. Longshoremen de
clared that all the oh us were
fired by men on the vessel or In

Fires From Windo.v.
When the battle opened, a mpin
in the office of the mill opened a
window, and, surroiiuded by
stenographers, began .'irlng with
a rifle. Longshoremen assert
that he fired at them. Police
say he fired into the air as a call
for help.
Striker Shot
In Riot Has
Even Chance
John Now, the union long
shoreman who was shot yesterday
afternoon during the Sperry mill
riot, has a fighting chan;:e for re
covery.
Drs. W. B. and Charles R. Mc-
Creery, who operated on the
union striker last night, said to
day that everything had been
done to save his life.
The bullet, a steel nosed one,
penetrated the abdomen, sever
ing four arteries and tearing the
Intestines in eight places. It was
necessary for the physicians to
remove 18 Inches of inte:.tine.
Sixty More
'Specials' On
Thirty more special policemen
were called for by Commissioner
Pettit, and 30 deputies by Sheriff
Longmlre, today.
When the 60 additional men
have been put on duty, they will
swell the total of special police
handling the strike situation to
over 10ft men.
Sheriff Longmlre Is calling In
deputies from all parts of the
county, on request of Commis
sioner Pettit.
These deputies, and police spe
cials, are patrolling the down
town streets, while 80 or more
uniformed men have been sta
tioned along the waterfront.

Appeal to
President
and Lister
Tacoiiiu employers appeal
ed to President Wilson for
aid lust night, alter the re
fusal of Commissioner Pettit
and Sheriff Longmii I offi
cially to request Gov. Lister
to send soldiers here to pre
vent further trouble in the
longshoremen's strike, it was
learned on good authority at
a lute hour today.
Governor Lister arrivi.d in Ta
coma early this afternoon and
went into executive session with
Commissioner Pettit immediately,
as the result of a mysterious re
quest telephoned the governor at
Olyni|iia last night for iiie calling
out of militia to handle the long
shoremen's strike trouble in Ta
coma.
Sheriff l.nngmire also attended
the session. Hot li Pettit and
Longmlre denied that they had
any intention of calling for state
militia.
"We want to talk with the
governor and determine to what
extent he will assist in prevent
ing strike riots and other trouble
In Tacoma. At present we have
no Intention of calling for mili
tia," explained Pettit.
Maj. Griggs of the St. Paul &
Tacoma Lumber Co. was one of
those who attended the confer
ence.
Sheriff Longmlre, Commission
er Pettit, and members of the Em
ployers' assoeation had a meet
ing yesterday afternoon, follow
ing the Sperry mill riot, and the
employers asked each official to
call for militia. Both i>ay that
they refused.
The governor, however, re
ceived a hurried call last night.
He communicated the request
to Adjt. General Maurice Thomp
son.
The Infantry and cavalry of 'he
state's national guard «io longer
exists, as it has been taken under
federal control.
The Coast Artillery Reserves
and Naval Militia are still avail
able, but their charter s said to
provide that they cannot be called
out for strike duty or slmll.tr
service.

Hats Off to Mothers
of the Troop B Boys
'One thing we mothers MUST NOT do," said Mrs. Milo ■■
Wolford, mother of Trooper <!. Wolfortl, this morning. "We
MIST NOT CRY when the boys go away. We can do our try
ing afterwards. The boys must not see It."
Troop It is living in a whirl of excitement, these days. It
Is getting used to camp life, It is shaking hands with visitors,
it is drilling furiously; and back of it till is the thrilling cer
tainty that in a very short time -perbepe within 21 hours—
they will be actually on their way to the border.
Troop B has little time to think, .just now.
What of the mothers of Troop II?
There Is no excitement to make. I heir «|tilet lion is fly quick
ly; they are not drilling themselves into the physical exhaus
tion that insures dreamless sleep. Antl back of their daily
routine is the knowledge that soon -perhaps in 24 hours—
their boys will be gone.
WHAT ARK THOHK MOTHRM THINKING Ol"?
They have plenty of time to think.
What are they thinking?
They do not say much. "My boy wants to go, and I am
willing."
"My boy is a member of the troop and it is his duty."
"I will not stand in my boy's way."
That is about all.
Hut Mrs. Wolford, 1026 South Sprague street, had some
thing more to say.
"I heard one of the men say he hoped his mother would
not come to the train when they start, because he didn't want
to see her cry.
CAN' CHY AT HOME WHKN THEY AUK QONK
"And I've talked it over with my boy. He says. We're
going gladly, and we don't want to be cried over.'
"It does make the boys feel so badly to see us cry. Of
course, we hate to have them go- but think how much worse
we would hate to have them unwilling to go.
"The great thing we can do for tliem now is to control
ourselves. Surely we can do It for just a little while. We
can cry at home, after they are gone; but while they are go
ing, we must be cheerful."
Hats off to the mothers of Troop Bl
Cold Shower
Strikers who attempt further
interference with the loading of
the Grace line steamer Santa Cms
will receive a cold shower of salt
water, according to Cominisslonef
Pettit today.
The steamer will be returned to

Frohman to smile as the waters closed above his head.
The Great Adventure has called, and they have
laid aside their businesses, said good-bye to friends
and sweethearts and wives, taken their lives in their
hands and followed.
It is the man whose blood leaps to meet great
duties and great opportunities; the man who dares to
risk everything; the man who can laugh in 'the bright
face of danger/ who builds greatly, lives fully and
meets death as a friend.
