Opera House Last
Night . '
Tiie most impressive public gather
ing ever held in this city was the fare
well meeting held for members of
Oo. G. Hospital Corps and members
of Field Staff last night at the opera
louse. The house was well filled.
Practically all of the men who are
going to the front were present and a
large number of citizens, both ladies
and gentlemen. Appropriate addresses
were made by Revs. Grant and Haw
kins. F. B. Arnold and Dr. Nisbet
also made short talks. An oppor
tunity was given to the soldier boys
to enlist under the banner of Christ
and a large number availed themselves
of the oppprtunity. A movement
was started to raise a fund for Co. G
and the Hospital Corps. $185.00
was secured at the meeting and .this
sum will in all probability be increas
ed by public subscription. This
gathering was one of the most im

much lasting good was accomplished
Rev. Grant and Hawkins, the orig

gratulated on the splendid success

Had a Good Time and Want
ed to Stay a Week
Longer
The members of the Earlington
Bee.s contest party who made the
Ohio River trip to Louisville and
Cincinnati via Evansville last week,
have returned home, according to ad
vertisement, on their special car Sun
day night on Train 93. The entire
party are unanimous in their praise
of this trip and say it was the most
delightful one in every way they had
ever enjoyed, The thanks of the
party are due too Mr. Thomas Qnin-
lan, of the Chamber of Commerce;
Mr. Bradshaw, editor of the Cincin-
natlan and Mr. Ey, of the Ameriean
Press Association; these gentlemen
accompanied the party on their sight
seeing trips, furnished passes to the
places of amusements and furnished
all necessary information regarding
objects of interest Cincinnati is a
very interesting city and her people
are courteous, friendly and hospit
able. The Bee's yarty enjoyed every
moment of their visit and regretted
their stay was so short. Miss Frieda
Heller and her sister Miss Estella, and
Miss Lavenia Edwards, met the party
on arrival and added greatly to the
pleasure of the trip. During the
stop over in Louisville the party visit
ed the armory and saw the Soldier
boys gelling ready to leave for the
mobolization camp, visited the pic
ture shows and did some shopping.
Too much cannot be said about the
trip, on the Tarascon, The boat trip
was the chief enjoyment of the party
and the Tarascon was turned over to
the Bee's party without reservation
Capt. Williams and the crew did not
spare any means to make the party
have a good time, and they certainly
did have it. Mr. and Mrs. Veeck,
and Mr and Mrs. Cowlishaw, ot Ev
ansville joined the party and added
quite a good deal to the enjoyment of
all as they were jolly good fellows
and out for a good time. There
were seven telephone girls ontheTar
iscon from New Albany, all members
of the "Flower Club," and believe
me they were having some time.
Their names were Mrs. Rickmeyer,
Mrs. Meinhardt, Mrs. Beader, Miss
Rockenbach, Mrs.l Schecter, Mrs.
Mary Trintler and Mrs. ltieber. As
you can readily see-from their names
they are French(?). These ladies had
a better time than any one and were
the life of the party while on the boat,
and these same gins will in all proba
bility go to the Mammoth Cave with
the Bee.s party on Saturday, August
20. An amusing incident occurred
while in Cincinnati!, the party stop
ped at the HotelMeltapole, where
when they first arrived the sign on
the building was yellow; that after
noon the management of the hotel
had it repainted green. This slight
change was the cause of some of the
party passing the hotel several times
without discovering it was the place
they wanted, and they were consider-
ably astonished when they did venture
in to find it was the right place.
Brought a Sampls With Her.
The tobacconist watched hor out
sldo his shop window. For fully half
an hour sho stood thero gazing
through tho panes. Then she came
in. Sho fumbled and fussed, and at
length brought forth a llttlo packet.
This sho cnrofully undid till, finally,
a small stub end came to view. Th
tobacconist raised bis eye owa In
quiringly. "Good afternoon, paid tho
lady, holding up the stub eud ginger

of one of my husband's special cigars.
Havo you anything to match It?"
BAPTIST REVIVAL
Continues Through Week
.Much Interest Being
Shown
The revival at the Baptis
church in this city, being con
ducted by Rev. M. E. Staley aid
Pastor Connaway continues thru
the week and probably longer.
Interest in the meeting grows
with each service and there havo
been several additions,
WHY FLTHOMAS?
Along with the three great ques
tions which have agitaled the minds
of all the great philosophers-namely
Who struck Billy Patterson? What
became of Charles Ross? and How
the apple came to be inside the dump
ling? may be placed the paramount
question of the Dark and Bloody
Ground; why should Fort Thomas
be selected as a mobolization center
for the Kentucky National Guard?
After much study and much re
search it is found that Fort Thomas
is a rugged army Post in the county
of Campbell. It is possible to reach
Fort Thomas, provided one possesses
the patience of a Cyrus Field and the
roving instincts of a Drake or a Ma
gellen. First you travel by rail Into
the village of New Port which is
just across the bridge from Cincin
natithen you wait patiently for a
street car and if one arrives ere you
lose all hope you may trolley away
to Fort Thomas. There you discov
er after you embark tiiat it is a small
army post, which by stretching will
accommodate one regiment, The
parade ground is admirably suited
