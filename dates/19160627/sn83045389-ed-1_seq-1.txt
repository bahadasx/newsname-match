WORKED HARDSHIPS
So stringent has been the examina
tion that valuable officers, V. M. I., and
V. P. I., graduates and others who are
able to ride and shoot, have been de
barred from entering the service. De.
harment has been occasioned in some
instances by the fact that the appli

inch under height or unable quite to
reach the necessary chest expansion?
this notwithstanding the fact that tho
men have been kept in confinement and
made to work hard since the mobiliza
tion order went into effect.
If Governor Stuart's request be
granted, a large number of men who
have failed tn the physical examina
tion because of some minor defect will

stated that men who have been re

Several State Department officials
have requested the Governor to release
clerks who had enlisted in the militia.
Governor Stuart declined to take such
action, holding that there was no State
lyty more Important than that, of serv

that he was well pleased with the spirit

Charles E. Hughes for President. and |
tn- 'J", .il Moofi" party practically went
out of existence as a national political
organization.
rhr decision to indorse the Republl
<r.-.r. presidential nominee came at the
end "f a stormy session. The fight
in :h~ committee for Hujrhes's indorse-j
ment was led by (?eor?re w Perkins, of

The radical element in ihe committee,

sin. ar.d John M. Parker, of Louisiana,
vigorously protested against the in

M-. Garfield next introduced a reso-.
lution Indorsing Hughes for President.?
and directing the executive committee j
of th* Progressive party to co-operate:
with the Republicans in the campaign. |
Mr. Coc'.-.em? contended the commit-!
tee had no- a ithorlty to indorse any'
candidate, and that its power was lim-i
ited to the filling of the vacancy on
the ticket caused by the refusal of
Colonel Roos*velt to run.
Chairman Hale ruled that the motion
to indorse or recommend the Republi
can candidate for President was out
of order, and a debate of several hours
ensued
Finally. Mr C.arfleld appealed from '
the decision of the fhair. and was sus- :
tained. S.I t.-> 14 During the discussion
Raymond Robins indicated he would
support President Wilson if the Pro
gressives did not put a ticket in the
field.
PARKER MAKES PROTEST
AG A I.VST AX Y INDORSEMENT
Mr Parker made a fiery protest
against any indorsement. Many of the i
Progressives were former Democrats,
he said, and had burned all their po
litical bridges when they joined the j
Progressive organization. He inti
mated he might vote for President
Wilson.
Before the roll was called on the
indorsement of Hughes. Colby made an
unsuccessful attempt to have nil action
delayed until August 5. the anniver
sary of the birth of the Progressive
pn rty.
While the debate was at its height
Clarence Straus read a resolution, said
to have been passed by the delegates !
from Virginia to the national commit- j
tee, opposing the indorsement of any ;
other than a Progressive f<>r Pre '.dent ;
and challenging the riuht of Mr Gar- ;

WASHINOTf^N', .rune ?Efforts to
wn rd Latin-American mediation in the
Mexican crisis, favored by Carranza
officials, collapsed to-day without hav
ing reached the stage of a formal
proposal to the United States. It. was
made plain by Secretary Lansing- t-o
Ignaclo Calderon, minister oi Bolivia,
who called with the intention of ask
ing whether the United States would
entertain an offer of the services of
its southern neighbors to aid in avert
ing war, that the Washington govern
ment sees nothing in the situation that
would warrant arbitration proceed
ings.
Mr Lansing talked with the minis
ter for hnlf an hour, and is under
stood to have told him that the blame
for the grave outlook rested squarely
upon Oen*rs! Carranza. The attitude
of the United Stales was so fully out
lined that Mr. Calderon did not men
tion directly the original purpose of
his visit.
When the minister left ' the State
Department he said the time "seemed
inopportune." and that for the pres
ent the diplomatic representatives of
six South and Central American coun
tries who had approached the Me.xi
1 can embassy on the subject of media
tion and received assurances that the
Carranza government was favorable to
j the principle, would not tender their
j good offices to the United States. Ho
indicated that the attempt to arrange
mediation might he renewed if General
Carranza's reply to Secretary Lansing's
note furnished any basis on which the
proposal could be founded.
IWITICD STATES WAITING

The United States now is waiting for
Cnrranzn's final word in reply to the
note sent yesterday demanding releaso
of the prisoners taken at Carrizal and
a formal diplomatic announcement of
intentions.
The note reached Mexico late last
night. Special Agent Rodgers re
ported its receipt, adding that he had
failed in his first efforts to place it
in the hands of the Carranza Minister
of Foreign Relations. Undoubtedly, it
was delivered to-day. Officials looked
f?r an answer within a day or two
at most.
Meanwhile, both Congress and tho
War Department put new urgency into
their preparations for war There
