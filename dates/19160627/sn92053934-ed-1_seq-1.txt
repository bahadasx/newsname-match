Minister Jose Luis Murature, has re
ceived an appeal from General Candido
Aguilar, Mexican minister of foreign
affairs for support of Latin-American
governments in Mexico's controversy
with the United States. General
Aguilar asserts that the United States
is attempting to maintain by force in
weak countries unjust claims on the
part of its citizens. He contends that
by agreement foreigners in Mexico,
who acquire property after a certain
period of time renounce the protec
tion of their respective governments.
Minister Murature has also received
a telegram from Dr. Romulo S. Naon,
Argentinian minister at Washington
expressing the hope that the difficul
ties between Mexico and the United
SUtes will be solved peacefully.
CASEMENTIN GOOD
SPIRITS AT TRIAL
.Rebel Chieftain Appears Chcerfnl
Court at Second Day of His
Hearing Public Apathetic
in
London. June 27. The second day
of the trial of Sir Roger Casement for
high treason opened with public at
titude apathetic regarding the case.
Attention of the country is focused
upon eastern and western fronts
where fighting has reached a critical
stage. ,
The prisoner appeared to be in a
cheerful frame of mind today.
The prosecution resumed introduc
tion of testimony when court opened.
Witnesses gave accounts of the
movements of Sir Roger and his com
panions, Captain Robert Monteith and
Daniel J. Bailey, from the time of
their landing on the morning of Good
Friday in a boat from the German
submarine near Tralee until the ar
rest of Sir Roger.
John McCarthy, an Irish farmer, de
scribed finding the boat in which the
three men were said to have landed
and told of finding buried on the beach
two hand bags containing revolvers
and ammunition.
Mary Gorman, a servant girl, iden
tified Sir Roger as one of three men
she met hurrying away from the
beach early Friday morning.
She was followed by Thomas Hearn,
a sergeant in the Irish constabularly,
who told of tracing Sir Roger to the
ruined fort in the vicinity of which he
arrested him. Hearn identified revol
vers, maps of Ireland a flag of the rev
olutionists which were found in a
hand bag. There was a stir in the
courtroom as the big green emblem of
the rebels was spread out in the cen
aer of the room. Casement shifted un
easily in his seat.
Alexander Sullivan, chief counsel for
the defense, said the emblem on the
flag was that of the city of Limerick.
Mr. Sullivan cross-examined the po
lice witnesses at length regarding the
general unrest in Ireland and brought
out the fact that the people of the
south were arming themselves against
those of the north and against con
scription and that after the Curragh
incident, when the military refused to
serve against Ulster, the southerners
felt they could not trust the soldiers
to protect them against Ulster volun
teers. THE WAR TODAY

of Major General Barry, in com
mand of the central department of
the Inited States army, it, was

morning C battery, so-called "million
aire" battery of Chicago, was mustered
in after having stayed up all night.
Shortly afterward E battery, which
had remained awake until 4 a. m., was
mustered in. Lieutenant Lewis R. (
Daugherty, federal muster officer, said j
he has reported these batteries and
.ten tl litiarv "fairlv woll omiinnnt '

Shortly after the mustering, the
members B, C and E batteries were
subjected to a physical examination,
each by seven surgeons of the United
States army. One medical officer ex
amined each man's eyes, another his
heaj-t, another the lungs, and so on,

composed of students from the Uni
versity of Illinois, all these units are
from Chicago. They were among the
first to reach the mobilization camp.
The First infantry was mustered into
the federal service yesterday and the
others were being mustered in today.
Local officials of the Chicago and
Alton railroad have been informed by
their Chicago office that empty troop
trains which will arrive here today
should be switched to the tracks at
Camp Dunne most advantageously for
a hasty departure of troops. Governor
Dunne expected hourly to receive from 1
General Barry at Chicago, the order to
entrain all troops now ready for field
service.
Equipment Distributed.
As fast as the regiments are mus
tered in, the equipment sent here by
the war department is distributed to
the partially equipped companies and
each man is put through a medical
examination by officers of the regular
army.
Thus far the mustering-in process
has resulted in the loss of only a neg
ligible number of men, some of whom
have refused to take the oath of al
legiance to the federal government be
cause they were under the misappre
hension that it meant re-enlisting and
others who were unable to pass the
federal medical test which is much
more severe than the state. It is esti
mated, however, that the infantry regi
ments will average 1,200 men each
after the mustering.
Complete Mustering of Seventh.
Mustering of the Seventh regiment
was completed today at Camp Dunne.
Staff of 17 of United States officers ob
tained a speed of one per minute in
examining the men who had been mus
tered in.
Approximately 1,500 men were ex
amined during the day and of these
about five per cent were rejected, ac
cording to Major James M. Phalen,
chief of the regular army medical staff
assigned to this camp. All of the men
rejected for physical disabilities
showed keen disappointment. Most of
those who failed were rejected because
of defective eyes and teeth.
The strength of the various regi
ments this morning follows:
First 55 officers, 1,192 men.
Second 50 officers, 1,116 men.
Third 55 officers, 1.285 men.
Fourth 51 officers, 1,140 men.

fable to obtain forage for their horses

The situation opposite Naco, Ariz.,
where 1,500 Mexican troops are being

COILING
STORY OF WOMAN
REVEALS HEIR TO
HAINES FORTUNE
Money, Mystery and Adventure Are
Elements of Testimony of Mrs.
Hitchcock in Tf ill Case.
Chicago, June 27. Upon the story of
Mrs. Caroline Hitchcock of St. Charles, I
111., which combines money, mystery
and adventure, may hang the disposal
of a half million dollars or more in
volved in the will of the late Charles
H. Haines of St- Charles, to Mercy
hospital of this city and the school
board of St. Charles, it was said today.
Mrs. Hitchcock testified in the will
case yesterday before Master in Chan
cery Frank Hamlin and brought to
light the existence of another "legiti
mate" son of the father of Charles H.
Haines, the heirs of the former now
being residents of Perry, Iowa.
The hearing was on the action for
partition of the estate brought by the
Mercy hospital authorities. Accord
ing to the evidence Robert J. Haines
went to St. Charles in 1S50 and made
a fortune. With him at a mill he
owned in the early days was a young
man named R. J. Simpson. Mrs.
Hitchcock declared that he was really
"R. J. Haines Simpson," and that he
was the legitimate son whose heirs
should get the estate.
Mrs. Hitchcock, whose home now is
in Chow Chilla, Cal., claims to have
been given the secret of the first mar
riage of the elder Haines by her father-in-law.
Her story described a mys
terious journey to a man named Allen
Henshaw, in charge of some church
records in the interior of Canada, the
exact location of which she could not
remember. She said she took a large
sum of money to the man, who tore out
the alleged record of the marriage of
Haines to Simpson's mother and that
she brought back the records to
Haines, who wished to destroy it. Be
fore she left, she testified, Haines
called in a priest and before him the
two swore they would not reveal the
secret of the marriage and the strange
mission to Canada. Mrs. Hitchcock
said she considered herself absolved
from the oath when she learned that
every member of the Haines family
was dead.
The witness described a long and
hazardous journey into Canada by way
of Detroit and her return to Chicago,
where she said she met the elder
Haines at the Sherman house. She
declared she had seen the papers she
brought back with her and that they
included the marriage certificate.
ORPET UNDER FIRE
OFSTATECOUNSEL
Waukegan, 111., June 27. William
H. Orpet resumed the witness stand
today. Attorney Ralph F. Potter of
the defense immediately asked about
the water and molasses which Orpet
sent to Marian Lambert "to relieve her
mind." One of these bottles he sent to
her, the other he brought, to her on
Feb. 9, the day of her death.
"I bought the bottle of six ounces
size of Otto Peterson and filled it two
thirds full in my room," he said. He
testified yesterday that when he met
Marian in Helm's woods she refused to
accept it, saying "that will not do me
any good."
Orpet was in better voice than yes
terday. He talked with more assur
ance and more connectedly.

Washington, Jane 27.
There were clear indica
tions today that if Ameri
can cavalrymen captured
by Mexican troops at Car
rizal were not released
within 48 hours action
would be taken by the
United States.
The impression prevailed In of
ficial circles that President Yfil

day at the latest and possibly not
beyond tomorrow afternoon for a
definite reply from the C arranza
government to the note demand
ing the immediate release of the
prisoners and a declaration of In
tention. Special Agent Rodgers at Mexico
City reported in an overnight mes

has influenced against pressing mat

border forces been sufficient to release
the regulars for aggressive operations
it is thought probable a time limit
would have been included in Secre

of the prisoners.
Advices from General Funston's
headquarters indicate that trains load
