MEXICAN FORCES ARf STRENGTHENB)
Both Armies Now Are Drawn Up in What is Virtually a
Battle Line—Embargo on Exportation of
Supplies to Mexico is Effected.
San Antonio. Texas, Jane 27.—General Funston and his staff
Mroiind every report from all border stations today for some sign of
hostility on the part of Carranza's army that Is pouring Into Northern
Mexico, but the real work at department headquarters, was the super
™ton of the multitudinous details incident to preparing the American
force for efficient action.
Over night and early morning reports from El Paso. Eagle Pass,
Brownsville and other headquarter.-, posts indicated iat no active
aggression by Mexicans and only a.brief reference was given to bandit
activities anywhere.
.Information brought to border commanders from the interior of
Mexico continued to show a steady strengthening of the Mexican
army In the North and tended to support reports that the bandit lead*
®Jj* are being welcomed gladly by Mexican officers and are being given
commissions in the de facto government's army.
The units of the American army have been stationed In such a
manner that almost instant action could be secured by the commanding
Officer here. No relaxation of efforts to guard border towns and
ranches from bandits has been displayed, but far more attention
been paid to martial!

Brownsville to the extreme west In in what, is In effect, a of
battle.
CARRANSA MUST REPLY AT ONCE.
Washington, June 27.—Mediation of the dispute with Mexico was
a dead issue today.
Twelve thousand national guardsmen arc ready to start for the
border to enforce the United State's demands on the Carranza govern
ment.
Secretary Lansing has prevented even a formal proposal of media
tion by telling Minister Caldweron of Bolivia, that the American gov
ernment believes nothing in the situation Is subject to arbitration.
Carranza previously had accepted "In principle," the offer to medl-
Further elimination of "red tape" by army officers hastened the
work of getting the troops to the border.
There were clear Indications today that if the American cavalry
men captured at Carrt*al are not released within 48 fours, action will
be taken by the United States. The Impression prevailed In official
cirrJos that Wilson will not wait beyond Thursday at the latest, and
possibly not beyond tomorrow afternoon for a definite reply from the
Carranza government to the note demanding the immediate release of
the prisoners and ^Cfiljiration otlntenttonsjs,,.

EMBARGO IS IN EFFECT.
§fn Antonio. Tex.. June 27.—An embargo on the exportation of
•applies Into Mexico from the United States has already affected the
Mexican army, according to reports received her*.: it became known
that the reason the Mexican force recently left Neuvo Laredo was be
cause it was unable to obtain forage for Its horSfes from this side of
the border.
The situation opposite Naco. Ariz., where I,BOO Mexican troops are
being held on trains aroused widespread speculation here.
General Funston announced that American officers are sure they
-naive fathomed the design of this Mexican troop movement and rein
forcements have been sent to the American force at Naco and en
trenchments have been thrown up there.
The activity at Naco was explained today. Information reached
headquarters that the Mexicans planned to sweep a
cross'the line to BIs
bee and there raid the offices and storehouses of copper smelting con
cerns. The Twenty-second Infantry was rushed from Douglas to Bla
bee last night.
Accuse United States.
Mexico City, June 27.—Foreign
Minister Aguilar made public today
messages sent to I ^atin-American
countries in which the government of
the United States is-accused of perfidy
and with concentrating troops along
the herder with hostile purposes to
ward Mexico.
The messages are in answer to com
munications from South American
countries Offering their services for
mediation.
The messages charge that after the
incident at Matomoros the United
States began gathering its armed force
along the international line with the
intention of aggression against Mex
ico.
Bandits Join Carranzistas.
El Paso, Tex., June 27.—Evidence
that the possibility of war with the
United States, has healed the breach
between the,Carranza and. Villa fac
tions in Mexico politics continued to
accumulate today.
Over 100 wealthy' Mexicans, who
prior to the .surrender of the Villlsta
garrison of Juarez last January had
been active in supporting the .bandit,
leader and who since then had been
refugees in El Paso crossed the Rio
Grande and apparently were received
in good favor by the authorities of the
de. facto government.
Private advices today said that sev
eral hundred men of tho force of
10,000 Mexican troops. which had
been concentrated at Fustillos. 70
mites west of Chihuahua City fpr. the
ostensible purpose of blocking any at
tempted American advance down the
Mexico Northwestern railway'toward
the capital, were formerly members
of bandit hands, scattered, and broken
by General Pershing's troops.

NAVY BUUMNG

Completion of Sixteen Capi
tal Ships in Three Years
Agreed Upon.
Washington, June 27.—A provision
for completion within three years'of
the navy general-board's building pro
gram of sixteen capital ships was writ
ten into the naval bill by a senate sub
committee yesterday on the recom
mendation of President Wilson. The
sub-committee previously had agreed
to accept the board's recommendation
for completion pf the program by 1922
but reversed itself by unanimous vote
after Secretary Daniels had explained
to the commltteeipen at yesterday's
meeting that the president, as well as
navy officials was anxious that con
struction be speeded up as much as
possible..
Tt is understood information re
garding the rate at which Europttn
nations are building, played. an im
portant part in the decision.
Addition of ten destroyers to the
building program for the coming year
was also, decided on by the sub-corn
mitfee. 'That
n%a*
Air*.
would bring
vessels of this type aqtterlsed fer
the total
1917 up. to twenty. There were nu
merous other increases over the con
struction provisions in the bill as
passed by the house. Including siibstl
'tutlon.of eight capital ships next
yeai^-four battle cruisers and four
dreadnoughts—for the house pro
vision for five battle cruisers and no
dreadnoughts. The administration is
particularly anxious that at least two
dreadnoughts be authorised.
The sub-committee, which is com
posed of Senators Tillman, Swanson
and Liodge, expects to report Thurs
day to the full committee.
"Everything justifies us in recom
mending more rapid construction of
the new naval ships than had been
contemplated originally," said Senator
Swanson last night, "and the whole
committee, we. feel confident, will ap
prove It."

Fort Lincoln. Bismarck, June ST.
—Further Indications of an early

Fort Lincoln came today with an
order for all recruiting officers to

Kach company had detailed at
the home station a lieutenant, a
non-commisstoncd officer and a
private to enlist men for the pur
pose of bringing the regiment up to
war strength, and these men are
expected In camp tomorrow.
This means that recruiting will
reaee and the previous orders to
equip the men on hand so that the
troops can leave immediately will
be carried into effect.
A good portion of the men re
cruited late hare been fitted out
and more equipment is being re
ceived hourly. As to where the
troops will go is still a matter or
conjecture, but from unoflidal
sources comes information that it
will be St. Louis, Mo. Tlic general
opinion is that the Xrtrtli Dakota

concentration camp, where troops
can be trained in masses and also
for the purpose of shooting on the
large ranges at. St. liouis.
The forenoon was spent in drill,
