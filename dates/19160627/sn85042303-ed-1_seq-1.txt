WILSON TO PUTTIME LIMIT ON
RELEASE
Sunless prisoners taken by Mexicans at carrizal
ARE RELEASED IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS, UNITED
STATES WILL ACT.
Possibly Wednesday, nnd Thursday at the Latest, Wilson Will
Force Issue, Unless Negro Troopers Are Released by the
Mexicans Only Lack of Troops at Border Kept Wilson
from Giving Mexicans Time Limit for Release of Ameri
cans, When They Were First Taken Every Day Sees the
American Army Better Prepared for the Swift Action that
May Follow Wilson Will Likely go Before Joint Session
of Congress House Overwhelmingly Disagreed to Sen
ate Amendment on Hay Militia Bill Eliminating Million
Dollars for Relief of Dependent Families of Militiamen
Mustered into Federal Service.
Washington, D. C, June 27.
There were clear indications
today that if the American cav
alrymen captured 'at Carrizal
Iwere not released in forty-eight
! hours, action would be taken
jby the United States.
I The impression prevailed in
official circles that Wilson
jivould not wait beyond Thurs-
'day and possibly tomorrow af
ternoon for a definite reply
from Carranza.
Wilson's first step, should he
decide to force the issue, would
probably be to go before a
joint session of congress.
I Every day's delay in what
seems an inevitable break in
relations! sees the army of the
United States in better position
for the swift action that may
follow.
i It was indicated that if suf
ficient troops had been on the
border, a time limit for the re
lease of the prisoners would
have been sent in the first
place.

LARGEST IN COUNTRY
Regular Troops at Fort Sill May Util
ize Cars Bringing State Troops to
Mobilization There and Be Able to
Entrain at Once.
Law-ton, Okla., June 27. After
months of tiresome waiting the regular
troops now at Fort Sill have been
ordered to the border. Batteries 13,
C, D and F of the Fifth field artillery,
now stationed here, received orders
last night to entrain immediately for
the border. Two batteries will go to
Brownsville and two to El Paso. The
guns at Fort Sill are the largest and
have the longest range of any in the
United States army. Immediately upon
confirmation of the orders, the regu
lars returned to the post to commence
packing in preparation for their de
parture. Everything will be gotten
ready immediately and it is thought
the regulars will utilize the cars used
to transport the Oklahoma militia here
for making the trip to the Mexican
border.
It was announced that the mustering
of the Oklahoma militia into the fed
eral service will commence today.
Captain Murchison and other recruit
ing officers of the federal army ar
rived here last night for this pur
pose. Some of the guards may fail
to pass examination, but it is thought
that practically all of them will go
through. It is thougnt the state
troops will not remain in training here
but that as soon as the mobilization is
completed they will be rushed to the
border.

TO VOTE BONDS PRESENT TAX
PERMANENT ABLEiVALUE OF
HIGHWAYS CARTER CO.
AT A MEETING IN CONVENTION
HALL LAST NIGHT IT WAS DE
CIDED TO TAKE THE QUESTION
OF BOND ISSUE UP AT ONCE.
To build permanent roads by a
bond issue not less than J200.000 was
the decision of the good roads boost
ers at a meeting in Convention Hall
last night and with Max Westheimer
as chairman, a committee of five
composed of Ed Gait, J. W. Kreuger,
Will Warren, T. H. Dunn and Mark
Kirkpatrick was appointed to confer
with the County Attorney and the
County Commissioners with a view to
having the election called at the
earliest possible date.
A strong campaign is to be made.
The people are to bo invited to
another mass meeting next Friday
night.
There was no idle talk at the meet
ing. The matter was taken up from
a strictly business standpoint and it
was decided that, it would be best
and practical to make a campaign for
permanent roads. "We owe it to the
farmers of the county to inaugurate
a campaign which will give them
something permanent," was the gist
of the , discussion. La. go property
owners were present and not a voice
was raised against the move but all
heartily endorsed it.
The committee met at the Court
house this morning and began its
work. The taxable values of the
county run a little in excess of
thirteen million dollars of which Ard
more is assessed nearly six million.
This means that nearly one half of
the bond issue would be charged to
Ardmore ' property and the balance
scattered over the county, the gross
production can also be used to help
reiire the bonds.
Definite plans for the meeting
Friday are being worked out and
it is expected to be one of the big
gest meetings in the history of the
city. .
In years past the business men of
this city have donated liberally to
construct temporary roads and make
repairs, they have seen their money
literally washed away by the first
shower, and have repeated the task
many times. The time has at fast ar
rived when it is no longer practical
or good business to continue this
practice, and the sentiment is grow-

Auto Not From That Town.
The Ardmoreite published a little
story yesterday iwhicn gave an ac
count of the purloining of an automo

their town, is getting entirely too pop
ular that if a boy at Newport or
Deese or at any other old place gets
into trouble it is reported that a Lone
Grove boy did it These two chaps,
say the Lone Grove people, hail from
Wilson, and now it is up to Wilson
to prove an alibi.
About the best thing for a boy to
do when no town wants to claim him is
to mend his ways, and make his com
munity proud of him.
