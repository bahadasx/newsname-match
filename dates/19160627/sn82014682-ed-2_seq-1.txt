The story , which is told among the,
TaniinonA with HmimntAntlal detail
is that the girl a 19-year-old Japanese
- r t. - t ' ja . v. .
01 tne uxmawan race, arneu un w
Shinyo Maru. from Japan on June 19
and as usual went to the immigration
station, ' where the "picture-brides"
are detained until claimed by tneir
hnahflnrtd-to-bft. The' eirl's hame is
given as Ushi Ishlhara. Her Intended
husband Is - said ,to oe one fenoaen
Ishikawa of Kekaha Plantation,
Kauai; .
According to the story told by Japa
nese, and 'Which has also been Keard
at te Japanese consulate, , Ishlkawa.
was unaBle to come from Kauat .at
once to claim his bride on account of
there being no immediate steamer fa
cilities, though he had received, wire-,
less word, that the bride was waiting.
It" appears , that the news that a
heautlful picture-bride was at the sta-,
tlon waiting ' for a husband, was cir
culatel.In the Japanese community,
and one O.; Toyama, a plantation la
borer at Heeia, learned of It and con
cocted the plan to steal the girl, if
she should "prove, on personal inspec
tion, to be as good-looking as reports
represented. Accordingly, it I1 said,
he went to the immigration, station,
saw the ; girl, wn8 satisfied, and hur.
ried to a Japanere hotel on Beretapla
street where he registered as Shoden
Ishlkawa! or Ishlhara of Kekaha,
Kauai. He Is understood to have told
the hotel manager he was here from
Kauai to receive his picture-bride who
came on the Shinyo, and on this rep
resentation, it is said, the hotel mana
ger went with him to the Immigration
officials to be his witness in claiming
the girl.
Toyama is said to have been exam
ined by the immigration authorities
and to have pass3d this examination,
upon which he was allowed to tKkf
the girl from the station. He is said
to have taken her to the same hotel
where he had register and to have
remained until Monday morning Ex
pecting that the bona fide husband-to-be
would arrive frcm Kaua'- yester
day, It is said Toyama left the hotel
early and went tack to Heeia with
the bride.
The Kam.1 man. arriving early in
the morning, vnt to another hotel
and asked. the manager there to ac
company him to the station and help
get the bride he had brought from
Japan. When the unlucky man
reached the station nnd was told that
some one else had taken his bride, he
was torn with race and despair, sum
moned his friends, and after inquiry
found that Toyama had gone to
Heeia. It is said they went to Heeia
and brought back the girl, but what
happened to Toyama no one seems
to know, though the Japanese commu
nity ha heard there is golag to be
some trouble.
Consul Moroi was absent from the
consulate this morning when tele
phone inquiry r.-as made. One of the
consular staff said that the news of
the abduction had reached the consu
late but they were not in possession
of the facts. Whether the consul
would investigate he could not say,
nor could he confirm the report that
the disappointed Ishlkawa had asked
the consulate to take the matter op."'1
