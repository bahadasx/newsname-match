Believe State Militia Will Be Called
to Mexican Border Immediately
IMPRESSIVE SCENE GREETS1
HUNDREDS OF SIGHT SEERS
"Although I cannot say definitely just when we will be order­
ed to the border, I expect that we will leave the later part of
this week. At any rate we will be fully equiped and ready to
depart for the scene of action by that lime. North Dakota will
be represented by one of the finest regiments of soldiers ever as­
sembled in any state in the Union."
The above statement came from the lips of Col. John If. Fraine,
in command of the First Regiment, North Dakota National iuard
in -an interview last evening.
Major Tyler, 1K. A-, received several telegrams yesterday
from Secretary of War Newton Baker. Secretary Baker's ord­
ers to the oHicers of the North Dakota regiment are "to equip and
mobilize without a moment's delay and be prepared to move at
any minute."
Arrival of the Troops.
Every company of national guards­
men in this state arrived at Ft. Lin­
coln Sunday and at 8 o'clock that eve­
ning the camp had been laid out and
with the exception of a few minor de­
tails the otucers and men were pre
ipared for the daily routine.
Comany A of Bismarck, Capt. Alfred
B. Welch fn command, was the first
company to arrive at Ft. Lincoln and
go into camp. With colors flying and
a large crowd of Bismarck people on
hand to witness the departure of the
local hoys for the mobilization point,
the crack company from the Capital
City left at 10:30 Sunday morning

Camp Is Set Quickly.
The lines for the various companies
were laid out by members of Com­
pany A Saturday so that as each com­
pany arrived at the Fort they immed­
iately set about raising their tents and
preparing for their stay there. Every­
thing undertaken was carried out
with machine-like co-ordination and
the men exhibited their excellent
training during this period of bustle
and excitement by obeying every com­
mand on the instant and last evening
hundreds of spectators were given the
opportunity of seeing the iboys "at
home."
1,069 Officers and Men Encamped.
Maj. F\ S. ,Henry of Vailey City, ad­

COL. FRAINE VERY
I
Leader of North Dakota Troops
Confident of Victory at
the Primaries
PLACES DUTY TO CdUNTRY
BEFORE OTHER AMBITIONS
Col. John H. Fraine, in command of
the entire First Regiment, North Da­
kota National Guard, is probably one
of the busiest, men in the state at the
present time. Col. Fraine, while right
in the midst of a campaign for the
nomination of governor of North Da­
kota, was called to take command of
the state troops and obeyed instantly.
He is at present located at field head­
quarters at Fort Lincoln and is per­
sonally superintending details there.
Although called to duty in the inter­
est of his country, the energetic lead­
er of one of the finest regiments of in­
fantry in the United States, has not
dropped from the political fight. He
will stick to the last ditch and in an
interview with a representative of The
Tribune Sunday evening gave his opin­
ion of the impending Mexican crisis
and also his political ambitions as fol­
lows:
"I am still in the race for governor.
I have never been out and will stick
to the finish. My friends are still with
me and I am confident that even
though I have been forced to discon­
tinue my campaign right at the cru­
cial moment, I will be well up in front
and have every reason to believe that
I will win out. I may lose many votes
owing to the fact that I have been
called to duty in the interests of my
country, but still believe I will he in
the lead when the excitement
sub-
sides.
"In my position, duty to the flag is
foremost, and I would rather forsake
everything rather than go back on
the grandest and greatest nation in
the world and our sacred emblem, Old
Glory. I answered the call of the lead­
er of our nation without a moment's
hesitation because I believe that I am
needed here. The men have confi­
dence in me, they will do for me what
they undoubtedly would not do for an­
other commander whom they were
not as familiar with, and they know
that I will lead them at all times and
will be with them, God permitting, un­
til the United States is again recog­
nized by the Mexicans as their super­
ior. My .men will fight like Trojans
for me and know that I will not send
them any place where I would not will­
ingly go myself.
"I am certain that we will be called
to the border, just how soon I would
not venture to say. I have one of the
finest regiments of men under me that
can be gathered together in any state
in the union or in any country in the
world and my officers, the people of
North Dakota as a unit, and myself
are proud of them and if they are giv-

Roosevelt Openly Commends
Nomination of Charles

PROGRESSIVES VOTE TO
SUPPORT NOMINATION
Administration Roundly Scored
for Its Inaction and
Watchful Waiting
Chicago, June 2ti.—Theodore Roose­
velt, in a letter read to the Progres­
sive National committee in session to­
day, finally declined to accept the
presidential nomination of the party
and urged the Bull .Moose organiza­
tion to support C. E. Hughes.
Accept Resignation.
After Secretary O. K. Davis read
Colonel Roosevelt's letter, in which
he finally declined the presidential
nomination of the party and urged
that Charles 10. Hughes be supported
by the members oi' the Progressive
party in order to defeat President
Wilson, the committee voted to accept
the Colonel's declination and take a.
recess for luncheon.
At the beginning of the afternoon
session, Chairman Miitthew Hale rul­
ed that the next order of business
was to fill the vaaincy on the ticket
caused by the refusal of Colonel
Roosevelt to run. Bainbridge Colby
of New York presented the name of
Victor Murdock of Kansas, chairman
of the national committee, who is now
on his way to China, as the party's
candidate for president. This led to
a clash between Raymond Robbii-is
of Illinois and Mr. Colby, in which the
"lie" was passed. -Mr. Robbins said
'Mr. Murdock had told him he would
not accept the presidential nomination
and the proposition to run a third
party ticket was defeated after a spir­
ited vote of 3il to 15.
Garfield Peacemaker.
James K. Garfield of Ohio then in­
troduced a resolution endorsing
Hughes for president and directing
the executive committee of the party
to co-operate with the Republicans in
the campaign.
Among the states voting for Hughes
on the roll call are: Michigan, Min­
nesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York, North Caroli­
na, Ohio, Oregon and South Dakota.
The resolution adopted endorsing
Hug'hes, offered by James R. GarfieM
of Ohio, reads as follows:
"Whereas, A statement issued by
thijs commitee in January and the
platform adopted by the Progressive
National convention sets forth that,
putting aside all partisan considera­
tion, in view of existing world and na­
tional conditions would work with any
man or party who saw the nation's
need and put forth a leader fit to
meet it, and
Hughes Satisfactory.
"Whereas, We believe with Colonel
Roosevelt, that in nominating Charles
E. Hughes of New York, the Repub­
lican party has put forth such a lead­
er, we therefore endorse and concur
in the recommendations of Col. Roose­
velt that we support Mr. Hughes.
"Resolved, That we hereby direct
the national executive committee to
co-operate with Mr. Hughes and takw
any steps that they deem proper, ef­
fectively to prosecute the campaign.
"Resolved. That we leave to the
state committee the determination of
action in their respective states and
recommend that whatever action they
take be taken after conference with
the national executive committee."
Before adjournment, the following

istration as "having been guilty of
shortcomings more signal than those
of the days of Buchanan."
Progressives EndorseHim.
By a vote of 32 to G, with mem­
bers declining to vote, the national
committee of the Progressive parly
today, at the end of a stormy session,
endorsed Charles 10. Hughes for pres­
ident., and the full Moose party prac­
tically went out of existence as a na­
tional political organization. The
fight in the committee to endorse
Hughes was lead by Senator Perkins
and .Mr, Lo\vell of California- The
radical element in the committee, rep­
resented by Matthew Hale of Mas­
sachusetts, Bainbridge Colby of 'New
York, Henry F. Cochems of Wiscon­
sin, and John M. Parker of Louisiana,
vigorously protested against the en­
dorsement of any candidate for the
presidency, and fought the endorse­
ment at every proceeding. The ma­
jority insisted on an open meeting of
the committee.

City Commission Approves Crea­

the Improvements
OWNERS MUST TRIM
TREES AND KILL WEEDS
The city commission last night in­
structed the city engineer to 'prepare
plans and specifications for carrying
out the paving program. The commis­
sion will meet tonight, at which time
the engineer will have the plans ready
for approval.
Two divisions were created, one
comprising the downtown streets to
be paved and the other the streets in
the residential section. The specifi­
cations will be prepared so as to per­
mit the commission to decrease the
amount 15 per cent if it sees fit.
Additional protests were filed by
George M. Register, gome names were
withdrawn from former petitions pre­
sented. Not including the protests re­
corded last night, the owners object­
ing represent about 13 per cent of the
property within the paving district.
The commisisoners voted to direct
the auditor to send notices at once to
all owners of property on which the
trees along the boulevard had not
been trimmed to the required eight
feet above the sidewalk and on which
the weeds had not been cut, that they
should at once take steps to obey the
ordinance in this matter or the city
would do the work and charge the
costs again:-.! the property.
Ordinances were introduced by the
paving committee and given first read­
ing, which provided for the placing of
all telephone and other wires under-*
ground within two years and prohibit­
ed the placing of any more wires
overhead.

Local Boys
In the Best
of Spirits
Captain Welch of Company A of
Bismarck stated last evening that the
local boys are all in the best of spir­
its and are anxiously awaiting the call
to aid in suppressing Carranza's fol­
lowers.
"The company now totals eighty
enlisted men," stated the captain of
the local company, "and before we are
called to the front, 1 have every rea­
son to believe that this number will
be increased greatly. Candidates for
enlistment are being sworn into ser­
vice every day. I am in command ot
a crack company and am positive that
the boys will cover themselves with
glory in the impending clash."

Pershing's Officers Believe .That
Move of Tenth Cavalry*
Was Peaceful
PATROLS SENT OUT
FOR PROTECTION
Columbus, N. M„ June 26.—It was
both a peaceful and permissible mis­
sion which the troops of the Tenth
Cavalry, commanded by Cnp'ain Chas.
T. Boyd, were engaged upon when at­
tacked last Wednesday, according lo
a view' expressed today by officers in
General Pershing's cohsmiis.
It was peaceful and permissible be­
cause no limitations bad been agreed
upon by the two governments which
would restrict patroling by the Am­
ericans.
When Gen. Trevino's warning that
his men would lire on American
troops moving in any direction ex­
cept north reached tlu oxuedirion.iry
forces, they were moving north grad­
ually in expectation {hat the Carr&n
zistas would occupy I he territory
evacuated and control it.
In the meantime, patrols were so«!t
out for protection and observatory
purposes. They moved in whatever
direction their immediate duties re­
quired. The Carrizal patrol was one
of them.
The report that General Pershing
occupied Nueva Casas Grandes, at
Casas Grandes, when the Mexicans
evacuated the town, is erroneous.
Anti-iAmerican Demonstration.
Eagle Pass, June 26.—The United
States consulate at Torreon was de­
molished June IS, by a mob of 3,000
civilians, lead by the mayor of the
city and a Carranza army band, ac­
cording to American refugees arriv­
ing here late today. The populace
was attending a bull fight, according
to refugees, when the de facto gov­
ernment troops forced them fo join in
an anti-American demonstration.
The mob rushed through the streets
shouting, "Death to all the gringoes,"
and upon reaching the consulate, tore
up the furniture and destroyed the
building. After destroying the Amer­
ican consulate the mob congregated
in the central plaza of the town, where
a mass meeting was held. The mayor
and other prominent exicans, it ft
said, addressed this meeting, inciting
the populace against the Americans,
advising that aJJ citizens of the Unit­
ed States be run out of the country.
GUARD ON MOVE.
San Antonio, Texas, June 26.—Dip­
lomatic exchanges between the Unit­
ed States and Mexico have ceased to
ocupy the attention of army head­
quarters here. With the regular offi­
cers and men ready for any eventu­
alities on the border, attention has
been turned for preparation of arrivil
of national guardsmen and whipping
into shape of those army units whic^
will take the place of the troops now
stationed along the Rio Grande.
Twelve thousand guardsmen are ex­
pected to start for somewhere in
Texas before morning. Nine thous­
and others are expected to follow im­
mediately, and within ten days Gen­
eral Funston is expected to have 70,
000 to supplement the regular army
units at his disposal.
General Funston today expected the
immediate movement of three briga
ades of three regiments each, of the
Illinois and Wisconsin guards, to
move immediately to Fort Sam Hous-

NATIONAL GUARD MAY BE
IN SERVICE IN TWO WEEKS
CARRANZA'S ANSWER
EXPECTED SOON
Equipment Lacking Is Not Due
to Negligence of N. D.
Officials
Washington, June 2fi.—Efforts to­
ward the Latin-American mediation in
the Mexican crisis favored by Carran­
za officials, collapsed today, without
having reached the state of a formal
proposal to the United States.
It was made plain by Secretary Lan­
sing to Ignacio Calderon, minister of
Bolivia, who called with the intention
of asking whether the United States
would entertain an offer of the ser­
vices of its southern neighbors to aid
in avoiding war, that the Washington
government sees nothing in the situ­
ation that would warrant arbitration
procedings. Mr. Lansing talked with
the minister half an hour and is un­
derstood to have told him the blame
for the grave outlook rested squarely
on General Carranza. The attitude of
the United States was so fully out­
lined that Mr. Caldron did not mention
directly the original purpose of his
visit.
When the minister left the state de­
partment, he said the time "seemed
inopportune," and that for the pres­
ent, the diplomatic representatives of
six South American 'countries, who
had approached the Mexican officials
on the mediation, received assurances
that the Carranza government was
favorable to the principle, ibut would
not tender their offices to the United
States.
The United States is now waiting
for Carranza's final word in reply to
the note sent yesterday demanding
the release of the prisoners taken at
Carrizal and a formal diplomatic an­
nouncement of its intentions.
The note reached Mexico City late
last night. Undoubtedly it was deliv
ered today. The officials look for an
answer in a day or two at the most.
Meanwhile congress and the war
department put new energy into their
preparations for war. Should a break
occur before the end of the week,
every posible precautionary step will
have been taken, and General Funston
will be in a position to defend the
border adequately and reinforce Gen­
eral Pershing's expedition.
FUNERAL AT ST. MARY'S.
Funeral services for Dennis Andrew
Hartness of Napoleon, who died Sat­

Although aggressive action may he delayed somewhat, the

.Supplementary orders to Departmental commanders called for
greater haste in getting the National Guard to the border. Auth­
orizations were sent, out to accept the men under the physical ex­
amination on which they entered the state service, postponing
final examination until they are en route or have reached the.
border. Those found unlit, will be sent back at once.
