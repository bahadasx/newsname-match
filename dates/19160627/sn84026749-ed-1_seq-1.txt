WILSON IS CONCILIATORY
Several Latin-American diplo
mats in Wahsington have tele
graphed General Carranza urging
release of the seventeen American
troopers held prisoners at Chihua
hua City, it was learned today.
These diplomats pointed out to
Carranza the diplomatic expedi
ency .of doing this if he is sin
cere in his expressed desire to
prevent war.
Since there is no war yet. the
captured men are not prisoners of
war, the diplomats pointed out and
cannot legally be held on that
charge.
Technically, it is "understood,
they can be considered in the
same class with Mexican, soldiers
entering Unjted States territory,
but it is not considered probable
the Mexican government will take
this attitude.

President WIIon 'ha conflded to In
ttmato friends his entlro willingness to
sacrifice his nolltcal fortunes In tho
forthcoming election rather than nvnld
a single opportunity that may remain
to prevenv war between the Unltod
States and Mexico.
To prevent tho tremendous loss of
life on both sides wftleh such n war
would entail, the President, some of
his friends Bay, has declared he Is will
ing: to fro to the furthest limits of di
plomacy to maintain peace.
for this reason. It Is strongly Inti
mated that If Cnrranxn's reply to the
demand for.the releasa of the American
prisoners Is satisfactory, the PreaUlont
will do his utmost to adjust amicably
the remaining Issues between tho two
countries.
Even should this demand he reject
ed, his lntlmaato friends declare, the
President would not declare war ion
Mexico, but by enlarging tho punltlvn

prisoners and further safeguard the
American border.

SEEKING AN EXCUSE
FOR INTERVENTION,
CARRANZA AIDE SAYS
Foreign Secretary in Message to Latin-America
Puts All Blame on Washington Trevino
Renews His Threat to Attack Troops
Unless They Move North.
MEXICO CITY, June 27. The charge that the United
States is attempting to seek a pretext for intervention in
Mexico is made by Foreign Secretary Aguilar in a message
to Latin-American republics.
"Apparently the American Government, without ade
quate" reasons for declaring war on Mexico, wishes to make
hostilities inevitable," wired the foreign secretary. "Mex
ico should win or succumb with dignity."
An earlier communication sent to the Latin-American
republics last night declared that the United States is con
centrating forces against the Mexican border and that, war
appears inevitable.
Evacuation of San Geronimo and Bachiniva by Amer
ican troops who moved northward , aroused high hopes here
that President Wilson is preparing to withdraw General
Pershing's expedition from Mexico.
NO EXPLANATION OF MOVE.
The War Department gave no explanation of the move.
A telegram from General Trevino, announcing the evacua
tion and declaring his purpose to attack the Americans if
they attempted to reoccupy the towns, was given out.
Notwithstanding statements in American newspapers
that war is imminent, a strong optimistic sentiment persists
among Mexican leaders here.
They are counting upon the pressure of other Latin
American countries and the fear of a breach in the com
mercial relations between Latin-America and the Unjted
States to induce President Wilson to move cautiously.
The Mexican newspapers print reports that the people
of all South American countries sympathize with the Mex
icans in the present crisis. South American diplomats, the
papers report, all regard the maintenance of the American
expedition on Mexican soil as a flagrant violation of Mex
ican sovereignty, and believe that the establishment of a
border patrol would prevent bandit raids.
Americans continue to arrive here from interior points,
but it is learned that several who went to Vara Cruz last
week now contemplate returning to Mexico City.
Messages pledging General Carranza support continue
to pour into the capital. Some of these are from leaders of
full-blooded Indians.
Entire quiet prevails here and there is little indication
except in the press of any grave international situation. The
Mexican people generally refuse fb believe that any serious
crisis is at hand.
