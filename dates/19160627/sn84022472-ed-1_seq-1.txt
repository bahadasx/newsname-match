Failure to Release American Cavalrymen and. to
Make Satisfactory Explanation of future
Policy Will Mean Immediate Action of United
States Against Carranza Government, Belief
"in Capital National Guardsmen Move South
As Washington Awaits Word.
Washington, June 27 There were clear indications to-
day that if American cavalrymen captured by Mexican troops
at Carrizal were not released with 48 hours action would be
taken by the United States-
The impression prevailed in official circles that President
Wilson would not wait beyond Thursday at the latest and-pos-sibly
not beyond tomorrow afternoon for a definite reply from
the Garranza government to the note demanding the imme
' diate release of the prisoners and a declaration of intentions.
Special Agent Rodriguez at Mexico City reported in an
overnight message received here today that he had delivered
the note to the Mexican foreign office yesterday morning. He
did not indicate how it had been received or when a reply
might be expected. '
Discussion of the Mexican crisis oc
cupied , today's brief , session of the
cabinet. When it was over, Secretary
Lansing announced there was no
changre in the situation, that th ad
ministration was awaiting- word from
. General Carranza and Secretaries Ba
ker and Daniels said no new army or
navy orders had been given.
While the United States awaited the
filial word from Carranza thousands
of national guardsmen all over the
country were ready to entrain for the
border to reinforce General Funston's
command for any operations (develop
ments. may make necessary.
Every day's delay in what seems
.the inevitable break In relations with
the Mexican de facto government sees
the army in . better position for the
swift action that may follow. This has
influenced against pressing matters to
an immediate issue. v
Advices from General Funston'a
headquarters Indicate that trains
; loaded with state troops are sweep
inf Bouthyard today from many parts
of the country. Additional regiments
are entraining or receiving the last
, necessary equipment.
Secretary Daniels stated .today that
the navy department had now sup-
plied ample accommodations for all
- refugees who may reach the seacoast.
The Atlantic fleet will not be ordered
to Mexican waters, he said, - except
"under exceptional circumstances."
. . " Consular advices during the day
from the few state department repre
sentatives in Mexico reported quiet 1b
the vicinity of their posts.
Two Massachusetts and two troops
bt ' field artillery from New Jersey
' rtarted last nigh. Indications are
that about 20,000 troops from New
Kork, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Con
necticut, Massachusetts rfmd Vermont
swill get away before tonight.
In addition, troops from Maine, New
Hampshire, Delaware, Maryland, the
fcHstrict of Columbia, Virginia and
"Florida, totalling about 15,000 men,
had received orders from Major Gen-
- era! Leonard Wood to leave today for
the border. Six thousand national
Fruard troops of New York, compris
ing the 7th, 71st, 14th and 47th regi
ments of infantry and a battalion of
engineers together with auxiliary sig-
' pal corps, field hospital and ambu

FUNSTON READY
FOR ACTION AT
MEXICO BORDER
Rearranging Stations So
That Any Aggression
May Be Repelled. ,
San , Antonio, June 27 General
Funston and' his staff searched every
report from all horder stations to
day for signs of hostility on the part
of Carranza's army that is pouring in
to northern Mexico, but the real work
at , department headquarters was the
supervision of the multitudinous de
tails incident to preparing- the Ameri
can forces for efficient action.
Overnight and early morning re
ports from El Paso, Eagle Pass,
Brownsville and other ; headquarters
posts indicated no aggression by Mexi
cans. Vnits of the American army have
been stationed in such manner that
almost instant action could be obtain
ed by the commanding officer here.
No relaxation of efforts to guard the
border towns and ranches from ban
dits has been displayed but far more
attention has been paid to marshalling
the thousands of men along the bor
der. - - '
The units of the National Guard
now moving throughout the United
States are expected to begin arriving
in Texas tonight. Where they will
be stationed will not be made public
here and in most cases those 'com
manding the guardsmen have not been
Informed of their final destinations.
Some impatience was displayed at
General Funston's headquarters today
that so much publicity already had
been given to Ihe movements of troops
and it was indicated as practically cer
tain that a censorship that would be
far reaching in its operation soon
would be instituted.
TROOPERS HELD IN JUAREZ.
El Paso, June 27 Two negro
troopers, ragged and half dead from
hardships, are lodged in jail at Juarez
today, having been brought from Guz

believed to be survivors of the Carrizal
engagement. '

Hartford, June 27 -The 'state
hoard of health has received from
Dr. Conn, of Middletown, a report '
on the analysis of two samples of
milk furnished the board from
Bridgeport taken In , connection
with the efforts of the board to
1 trace the origin of the epidemic
of sore throat in that city. The
analysis shows that the milk was
contaminated with the bacilli of
streptoccl.
Dr. Conn says that the evidence
is conclusive that the epidemic
was caused by the presence of the
bacilli in the milk. -
The secretary of , the state
board of health when he received
the report today communicated
it to the Bridgeport health offl-
.cer . and Impressed on the latter
. the Importance of the statement,
that the milk which was . being
used In Bridgeport at present was
infected. ': i .
' The milk will he pasteurized
and now that the origin of the
disease Is known everything will
be done to prevent the epidemic
from spreading.
The last steps are being taken by
local and state boards of health to
day in assuring a pure milk supply
to Bridgeport. With the entire herd
of the Beaver Brook Dairy Co., at
Milford, reported by bacteriologists as
free from infection, every employe
was yesterday examined for latent
throat germs. A report on the cul
tures taken yesterday is expected late
tonight.
Pending the outcome of .this further
investigation the dairy again has sus
pended its sale of milk. Although its
representatives assert that there is no
doubt that the cattle and milk supply
of the dairy are above suspicion, they
add that they wish to co-operate with
the authorities in every way.
As a possible cause of infection that
may have been transmitted in milk

It is hoped that Mrs. Papp's father,
who lives in Welland, Ont., will, fur

Theft is Found Dead in
Kitchen of Cafe in Early
Morning.
Chapter of Misfortunes
Preyed Upon Mind of Wo
man Until She Ended Life
With Pistol.
Brooding over reverses of the day
and unable to sleep, Mrs. Teresa Past
nyck, 34 years old, of 820 Pembroke
street, committed suicide early this
morning by holding a revolver in her
mouth an'd then discharging two bul
lets that pierced her brain. Death is
believed to have been instantaneous.
No one heard the report of the pistol
and the act was not discovered until
nearly 6 o'clock, when her husband
went into the kitchen for his break
fast. ,
Mrs. Pastnyck, who was of a very
nervous temperament, purchased the
Balooiy at the above address about a
month ago and according to her hus
band and employes, was doing a very
profitable business. The money that
was invested belonged to her, though
the husband, Simon Pastnyck, con
ducted, the business and tended bar.
Besides the saloon, she conducted a
dining room and also had ' several
roomers.- The dining room was next
door to the saloon and the kitchen
was in the rear of the dining room.
The sleeping quarters of the family1
and the roomers were on the second
floor.
Last night Mrs. Pastnyck retired
about 10 o'clock and at midnight the
husband closed up the saloon. He
figured up the total of the day's busi
ness and after seeing that everything
was in readiness for opening this
morning, went upstairs about 12:30
o'clock. He carried with him a re
volver with . whih he was always
armed when carrying the receipts of
the day.
Going to his room, Pastnyck placed
the revolver in a bureau drawer and
got ready to go to bed. The wife
awoke and told her husband that she
was not feeling very well as she had
met with adverse fortune during the
day and that nothing seemed to go
right , . She stated that early in the
morning she had . given the cook. $5
with which to buy meat' for the dinner
but that the.cook did not. return and
consequently the dinner was not up to
the standard; The boarders complain
ed and to make natters worse, one of
them left without settling his bill.
. Pastnyck .went to sleep after a short
while but when he awoke about 5:30
this morning he detected the odor of
gas. He did not pay any attention to
it as he believed that his -wife, in get
ting breakfast, hal allowed some of
i the cooking gas to escape. He went
aown to ine Kitcnen, wmcn was oarit,
but did not hear his wife moving
about. He found her sitting in a chair
in one corner of the room, apparently
asleep. The gas irr the range was
turned on but not lighted. Going to
her side he shook her and was dumb
founded to see her mouth open and
blood streaming from it. Beside her
on the chair was the revolver. He
felt her hand, and it was cold.
.Calling to the other roomers, Past
nyck had the policeman on the beat
summoned and the ambulance corps
was called. Dr. J. H. Powers saw that
the woman had died a long while be
fore. Medical Examiner S. M. Garlick
was notified.
Medical Examiner Garlick found
this afternoon that Mrs. Pastnyck had
taken her own life.
Several flat irons were on the stove
-but the husband stated that Mrs. Past-

mitted to probate today, divides her
$100,000 estate between her children,
Edwin Sanford Hurd and Catherine
Judsoft Hurd. The daughter, how
ever, receives the largest share, in
cluding all realty holdings.. The prop
erty where the new high school now
stands was once part of the Hurd es
tate. It is a peculiar incident that the
settlement of the estafle of the de
ceased husband of the testatrix was
completed only a few days ago. Mrs.
Hurd died on June 21. Her will was
drawn on December 27, 1911,' but
there is a codicil dated March 24,

wearing apparel and the remainder of
her silverware.
In Article 4 of the will she devotes
$1,5 00 for the purchase of a burial plot
and to use $300 thereof for its per
petual care. The codicil revokes this
provision and sets aside $300 for he
Mountain Grove Cemetery association
to insure care of her plot.
In Article 5 of the will the testatrix
provides that the residue of the estate
! go to her husband, Frank W. Hurd.
' He pre-deceased her, however, and in
the codicil she revokes all bequests
made to him in the will.
To the daughter, Catherine Judson
Mrs. Hurd gives her country place
known as "Mettechawon," near Still
River, including all real estate of
which she was possessed at .death
either in New Milford or Bridgeport.
She also bequeathed to the daughtei
all buildings on these lands, all house
hold furniture and all other contents,
including her stables and horses.
The residue is made a trust fund
and the will names the Connecticut
Trust & Safe Deposit Co., of Hartford,
as trustee but the codicil revokes this
appointment and names the Bridge

in the testament is for the following
purposes:
To be divided in two equal portions,

"Somewhere in Mexico, via Colum
bus, N. M., Am not coming out of

Sidney."
PRICE TWO CENTS
In addition to the congestion caused
by the derailment of the car, the lack
of coaches for the officers and men !
made the possibility of entraining be-.'
fore nightall a matter of doubt.
The overturned car, whichs, was lad
en with first aid stores blocked both
main tracks. To the east of" the de
railed car soon accummulated two
score or more of passenger coaches
which were filled with Massachusetts
troops. In addition to the derailed
car the platform of the next carwas
crushed in.
At- the time of the accident the
ambulance company was lined up on
the station platform ready to entrain.
This command had been at the station
since 6 a. m. The first sergeant had
just ordered the men to fall in for the
section was being slowly shunted down
to the platform.
As the men stood there in line they
saw the first freight, car topple over.
It was necessary for the men to begin
unloading their supplies and to trans
fer them to other cars which were
shifted up to that point.
Two commands were able to get
away during the morning after a long
and tedious wait all night. The signal
corps, which was the grst unit on the
schedule for departure, was marched
out of camp at six o'clock last night,
stayed above the station two hours
and then marched to a siding where
the men got into some coaches and
stayed there all night. This section
was finally made up and departed
west at 8:55 followed a little later by
Troop B, of Hartford.
The troop loaded its baggage last
night and the men were marched to
the station and at ten o'clock were re
turned to camp with their horses. The
field hospital and ambulance company
was the next on the schedule to be en
trained but the railroad accident held'
it up for an indefinite period.
At noon officers of the .first infantry
fetl certain that they would get away
late in the day but the second infan
try officers seemed of the impression
that they would be in camp another
night.
While the two Connecticut com
mands were being dispatched troops
containing commands from the second
and eighth Massachusetts regiments
went by the Niantlc station. .
On the camp grounds the men who
were there had little to do. Towards
noon some of the infantry company
began to strike their tents again but
they did it leisurely.
There were few orders from General
Headquarters. The most important
one was that detailing reserve officers
to undertake the instruction of re
cruits who are left behind. Major J.
Richard North of the second infantry
will command the depot battalion of
five companies of recruits. The other
officers will be: Lieut. Gadd, of Hart
ford; Captain Haggerty, of the second
Infantry; Captain Bollman, who has
been with the Yale batteries; Captain
E. B. Thomas, of New Haven; Cap
tain Bliss, of Meriden; Captain Che
ney, -of South Manchester; Lieut. Fra
zer, Lieut. Sherman; Lieut. King 'of
Hartford, and Lieut. 'Theodore Lilley,
of Waterbury.
Troop A, cavalry, will probably be
ordered to the southwest within a very
few days, receiving its mounts from a
supply station which will forward
them to the troop's destination. Mean
while, during its stay in camp, the
troop is doing entire guard duty.
Neither Infantry regiment will take
a band with it. The entire First regi
ment band refused to take the Fed
eral oath and it will be left behind.
Only three men, including Leader
Frank Fichtl, would take the Federal
oath In the Second regiment band.
Lieut.-Colonel Tilson, who joined his
regiment last night,' was ordered by
Colonel McCabe to see the band and
ask it what It would do. Leader
Fichtl reported to Colonel Tilson, with
a paper on which were three names.
Lieut.-Colonel Tilson reported to Col
onel McCabe in these words, handing
him the paper:
"Here is the band." With this nu
cleus of two bandmen. Leader Fichtl
was ordered to try and recruit the
band so that it would go with the
regiment. The other bandsmen will
remain in camp.
The lack of tourist sleepers for the
enlisted men was one of the causes of
delay In making up sections. Lieut.
Colonel Tilson, to whom had been as
signed the task of handling this mat
ter with the railroad officials, reported
at noon that enough tourist sleepers
had been promised to provide for the
men of both regiments. -The plan was
to deliver these cars to the regiments
at New Haven.
