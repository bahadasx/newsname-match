1.500 Mexican troops had arrived op

It Is assumed at he ailquartci s that
as the country adjacent to Currizal

been picked up and that those still

position of the two squadrons has
lieen left absolutely to the discretion

Anxiety has been expressed anionic

hoped that tiny were not left to the

WASHINGTON. June 2. Kf forts

Carranzii officials collapsed today
without having reached tho state of
a formal proposal to tho Fnited

Intention of asking whether tho
1 lilted Slates would entertain an of
fer of the services of Its southern
neighbors to aid In nvoldlng war,
that tho Washington government sees
nothing In tho situation that would
warrant arbitration proceedings.
Mr. Lansing talked with the min
ister for half an hour and Is under
stood to have told him that the
bbimo for tho gravo outlook rested
entirely on General Carranza. Tho
altitude of the Fnited States was so
fully outlined that Mr. Cahleron did
not mention directly the original pur

Time In Opportune.
Whon tho minister left tho state
department he said tho time "seemed
Inopportune" and thut for Si; present
tho diplomatic representatives of six
Central and South American coun
tries who had approached the Mex
ican embassy on the subject of
mediation and received assurances
that tho Carranza government was
favorable to the principle, would not
tender their good offices to tho
Fnited States. He indicated that tho
attempt to arrange mediation might
be renewed If General Carronza's re
ply to Secretary Ijinslng's last note
furnished any basis on which the
proposal could ho founded. The
Fnited States now Is awaiting for
Carranza's final word In reply to tho
note sent yesterday demanding re
lease of the prisoners taken at Car
rlzal and a formal diplomatic an
nouncement of Intentions.
The noto reached Mexico City late
last night. Special Agent Rodgers
reported Its receipt, adding that he
had failed In his first efforts to
place it In the hands of the Carranza
minister of foreign relations. Fn
doiibtedly It. was delivered today. Of
ficials looked for an answer within ft
day or two at the most.
Meanwbllo both congress and tho
war department put new urgency
Into their preparations for war. There
were Indications that should a for
mal break occur toward tho end of
tho week every possible precau
tionary step will have been taken and
General Funston will he In a posi

although aggressive action may he

War department activities during
tho day covered a wide field.
Supplemental ordi rs :.i depart

haste In getting the national guard
to tho border. Authorization went
