W. J. Stoessel and L. S.
Eads Write of Army Train
ing at Nevada.
BOYS ARE ALL HAPPY
Say Bacon Grease Tastes Like
Cake After a Day of
Hard Drilling.
Sonic of the daily doings of the boys
in the Columbia Machine Gun Com
pany, now at Nevada, Mo., may be
learned from the two letters printed
below. One, from Private Lee S.
Eads. is printed in full. The other,
from Private Walter Stoessel, was a
personal one, and only extracts from
it arc printed. Both arc University of
Missouri boys.
To all my friends in Columbia: The
members of the company are all in
high spirits this evening and proud
that they belong to the Machine Gun
Company from Columbia. We arc well
sheltered and have good beds and do
not need an anesthetic to make us
sleep.
Perhaps the best way for me to tell
of our doings since we left Columbia
is to copy a few notes from my diary.
which I have resolved to keep in full.
and thus far have kept my resolution.
Please excuse the rough-shod man
ner in which I trample over gram
matical rules, but my diary must be
brief, and now I have no time to re
construct as it is only thirty minutes
until "taps." (I begin with the leav
ing of the train. You all know what
happened before so it is unnecessary
for me to recapitulate.)
Had Music on the Train.
After the train pulled out we all
found seats and made ourselves as
comfortable as possible and tried to
wear a nonchalant expression. Most
of the men began to smoke their
comp cigars. Corporal 'White turned
up his ocharina and some one found
a French harp and harmony followed.
The "Barcarolle." "Way Down Upon
the Suwanee Hiver," "My Old Kentuc
ky Home" were listened to by a pen
sive audience. Then "Nellie Gray" was
popular. The men hummed the tune
and goodness knows how many Nel
lie Grays there were in Columbia just
then.
We waited about forty-five minutes
in Mcliaine it seemed like a century
to me and our car was hooked on
to the Flyer and we were off for sure.
Just then everybody got hungry due
to loss of appetite during the two
days previous, I suppose, and the jokes
went around about the sand fleas and
cactus juice that we would feast on
in the future with sand for dessert,
maybe.
Hamcy l'lajs a Joke.
Sergeant Kamey reversed a sign
which read "For Whites" on one side
and "For Negroes" on the other and
narrowly escaped being thrown out of
the window. Everyone made himself
as comfortable as possible and
quiet (?) reigned.
June 22. We detrained at camp at
8 o'clock and marched about half a
mile to the place reserved for us.
Sandwiches were procured at the de
pot in Nevada and each person was
allowed one. On that one aforemen
tioned sandwich we had thirty min
utes close order drill and made it
snappy (?) which was a mighty
good appetizer, but unnecessary just
then. Our suit-cases were hauled out
and placed in a row on the ground,
and the men lay around on the ground
beside them. We have one of the best
locations in camp, near the top of a
slight hill overlooking the entire
camp.
IiisriMt-rs Some Fried Chicken
When we became domiciled Cor
poral Horner found some fried chicken
in his suitcase. We "snook out" and
well, there was not even chicken
bones left, but then, frying chickens
are very small at this time of the year
and we only had one among three of
us. (We pitied the others, but could
do no more.)
The stove was put up and the fire
started, but there was nothing to
rook. Some one interrogated the
crowd as to the edibility of soap,
fried or baked. About 12 o'clock we
were ordered to fall in line and re
ceive knife, fork, spoon and tin cup.
There were only about half enough
mess kits to go around. Sergeant
noberts passed around a box of
chocolates, which he said had been
' warmed over, and I guess he was
right, for we had to use spoons to dip
with. The company next to us had
dinner long before we did, but ours
came at last and it certainly did taste
good.
llinner Prunes, Bread and liacon.
We had prunes, bread, bacon, (the
coffee and beans did not get through
cooking) and, joy unspeakable! we
were allowed to "sop" our bread in
the bacon grease after the bacon had
been removed. Strawberries and cake
never tickled my palate as this did.
I did not know just how well I did
like meat grease when I had plenty of
it. Had I only appreciated the slip
pery liquid when I had the privilege
of the Cafeteria I might have had a
superior brand but we never ap
preciate the things we possess when
we have them in abundance.
Our tents came and were put up in
the afternoon. Army blankets and
bed ticks were also distributed. I
was assigned to the sergeants' tent,
the fir3t one on the street. Our ser
geants are Cornel, Klinkerfuss, Bob
erts, Barney, Galligan and Garth, all
in the first tent. The tents are 12x12
feet, 3-foot side flap, pyramidal and
brand new. From eight to ten men
stay in each.
Officers Are Appointed.
K. E. Major was appointed captain;
II. B. Gibson, first lieutenant; and
J. P. Price, second lieutenant. Thus
far I have had the good fortune of be
ing the only man in the company ex
cept the officers who does not .have
to do "kitchen duty." and that is be
cause my duties as clerk occupy most
of my time.
June 24. We are being "mustered
in" this afternoon and hope to get
our clothing this evening.
I have written this much on the
installment plan as you may be able
to see. Have been three days writing
it. Sometimes 1 write half a page
and then have to do something else.
I was detailed to do about three
hours clerical work at regimental
headquarters this morning, and thus
it goes.
The boys arc beginning to get their
"mess kits" now. I have none yet
but usually eat with Sergeant Bob
crts. We have just had our picture
taken.
For goodness sake somebody write.
"V. J. Stoessel Writes.
The following is part ot the letter
from AV. J. Stoessel:
When we got off the train at Ne
vada several companies from St. Louis
were here and we were loudly cheer
ed. The colonel, who was at the sta
tion when we rolled in, said later that
we were the best looking bunch that
had arrived.
The camp is equipped with shower
baths, and we make use of them daily.
The first night here we cut loose with
some Missouri songs.
camp didn't know what was going onJ.N .,r.,0s'e.
at first, but when we finished up with
the "Varsity" they knew who we were I
and they certainly did applaud us. A i
man from Drake in the adjoining camp I
cave his yell, and this started the '
whole camp. We arc known all over
the camp as "that Missouri U. com
pany." Ot Up at r, o'clock.
We get up at 5 o'clock in the morn
ing, drill about eight hours a day and
get to bed about 11 p m. I
Colonel McNecly. who is an M. U.
graduate and was captain of the
crack cadet company the year before
the Spanish-American War, gave us
a long talk this morning, compliment
ed us on our drilling and said he
would see that we got complete
equipment. He said that this com
pany would positively be called to
the border between Tuesday and
Thursday. (We're going to get In it
after all, thank goodness.) This is
the only instance anywhere the col
onel has become intimate with the
men.
After the colonel had finished talk
ing to us we gave him "fifteen ana
ended up with the "Varsity." It
brought tears to his eyes. He started
to speak again but didn't seem to be
able and just turned and walked
away.
Well, boys, I wish some more of you
ould come and join us. we are ;
certainly having a great time and
there goes that darn bugle! So
long.

JULY 4 CELEBRATION
TO BE WAR BENEFIT
Civic and Social Organiza

Plans Work Out.

Idea Originates With Red
Cross Society May Be
on Rollins Field.
Columbia will celebrate the Fourth
of July, and the money taken in will
go as a benefit to the Columbia Bed
Cross Society to be used for our own
Missouri regiments if the plan thought
of by members of the local society is
adopted.
The society discussed plans yester
day with representatives of the Elks,
ilie secretary of the Commercial Club
aaid Mayor J. M. Ilatterton. A meet
ing was held last night at the Elks'
home, and it was decided that a meet
ing with two representatives of every
civic, fraternal and social organiza
tion in Columbia should be called for
7:30 o'clock tomorrow night at the
Elks' home to discuss the proposition.
The plan, as it stands now, is to
hold a patriotic celebration on the
evening of the Fourth of July at some
place easily accessible to all, probably
on Bollins Field. There will he
amusements of all kinds on the
grounds and refreshment stands, op
erated by the members of the socie
ties, where the crowd may quench its
thirst. One speaker will be brought
to Columbia to deliver the address.
The speaker's stand will be on the
football field, and the audience will
sit on the concrete bleachers. Am ad
mission fee of .". cents to the grounds
will also be charged.
"I can see no reason whv the pro-
' ject should not be put through." said
i Mayor J. M. Batterton this afternoon.

everyone can attend."

BROWNS NEED MONEY
Effort Will Be Made This
Week to Put Baseball
Team on Its Feet.
An effort will be made among the
business men of Columbia this week
to put the local baseball team in good
financial standing. At the present
time the Ilrowns are on the wrong
side of the ledger about $75 for lo
cal debts and salaries.
In every other town in the league
the business men have subscribed to
pay the loss of the team during the
season. The first of the season Ccn
tralia business men donated $2,000 for
the support of a team. At Mexico fifty
business men back all losses. At
Moberly, at a recent meeting, thirty
business men took all chances of the
team losing money and will pay all
outstanding debts and the debts that
will come with the remaining games.
"Something of this sort must be
done if Columbia is to hold the team
together for the remainder ot the sea
son," said George D. Taylor, man
ager of the Drowns, today. "We have
a team that will hold its own against
any team in the league, but the ex
penses are too great for the gate re
ceipts.
Only half the games are played at
home and this means a total loss of
salaries and incidental expenses when
the team is on the road," said Taylor.
Every good ball player in the coun
try has a chance for the team if in
any way he can be of any use to us.
Leegan. a new shortstop, was added
to the list and played in Sunday's
game against Mexico. In this one
game he showed real class and is at
the present time the fastest shortstop
i jn ine league.
Duff, an outfielder and
first baseman, has been added to the
Ilrowns, and others will be gathered
if they show the ability."
The Ilrowns will play Mexico at
the Fairgrounds park Thursday. The
game will be called at 3:30 o'clock.
Week-day games will be arranged for
the remainder of the season. These
games will be of the same class as
the regular league games, but they
will not count in the league stand
ing. The pitchers for Thursday's
game will be selected from Phillip
Umstatt, Cruickshank and Taylor.
Other new men may be seen In the
Browns' line-up.
