GERMANS
HAVE SON
JOIN ARMY
Yes, sir, I suppose I am German, I
was born in Germany and I spent my
childhood there. But I'm an American
and I'm for America first and last. I've
got a boy here, he wants to join the
army, and I want to t'irii him over to
Uncle Sam. It's our way of showing
that we are just as patriotic as any
body else. We want to do our part."
This is the manner in which Jacob
B. Mangelson of Anadarko presented
himself at the recruiting station this
morning. With him was his son, Ja
cob, Jr., who was 18 years and three'
months
old. The boy's mother was
also born in Germany.
Recruiting has been extra heavy
during the past ten days, according
to Sergeant John J. Coons, in charge
of the local office. About forty men
have applied for enlistment. Six
of
this number have been accepted.
FARMS WILL
NEED MORE
LABORERS
Grady county farmers are likely to
face a scarcity of labor when the wet
weather is over with and crops must
be cleaned out, thinks Arthur Ersland,
secretary of the Retail Merchants as
sociation, who is attending to the plac
ing of hands during the absence of
Agent O. C Cooper.
Reports coming in from farmers in
dicate that practically all cutting of
small grain has been done, Mr. Ers
land states. Threshing will begin
just as soon as tho shocked grain has
had time to dry out and hundreds of
acres of cotton will have had time to
be gone over with a hoe. A great deal
of corn in the low lands has also be
come wedy during the rainy period.
Much of this will require paid labor
as the corn has beconv too large to be
cultivated.
The secretary attempted to tele
phone to a number of leading farmers
this morning but he found rural tele
phone w ires down. Information he has
received in the past few days indicates
that little damage has yet been done
to shocked grain except on wet land.
The loss is reported to be practically
negligible if clear weather conies
soon.

State Farm Loans for Week Endisg June
17 Reach Total of $107,100
Goes Directly to Borrowers
at Five Per Cent
EFFECT ON INTEREST
CHARGES IS MARKED
Secretary Smith Predicts Private Compan
ies Will be Forced to Meet Competition-Amount
Now Avial
able for Loans $7,000,000
Oklahoma City, Okla., June 2". i
Making farm loans, for the week end
ing June 17th all previous records
were broken by the allowance of 107.
100 loans by the commissioners of
the office. The average loans had
ranged from IjU.OOO to $75,000 per
week for aevral weeks past and this'
money goes directly to the borrowers
on five years' time at 5 per cent In
terest and Is having a tremendo'ia ef
fect on the rates being charged in tha
state and already many loan compa
nies have revised their rates to meet
state competition by reducing them
from 10 per cent to 8 per cent in aptne
parts of the state and In other parts
reductions have been road from 8 per
cent to 7 and C4 per cent.
Secretary G. A. Smith of the school
land department has repeatedly said
that It would only b a matter of time
until all loan companies of tK';jtata
would be compelled to meet the Mate
rates and that interest rates on farm
lands will ultimately cotue to a -3 per
cent or 6 per cent basis. ' ' ,
Tho present taxuble farm land valu
ation of the state of ' Oklahoma is
HC1,803,325, according to official fig
ures iu the state auditor's office. A
conservative estimate based on the ex
perience of many of the most promi
nent farm loan men of th state U that
."5 per cent of the taxable lands of the
Btate are under mortgage. This would
signify that the value of the lands
under mortgage is 234r041,328. The
samo men estimate that the amount
of mortgages upon mortgaged lands
averages about :i5 per cent. This
would mean that the total mortgaged
indebtedness of Oklahoma is $83,914,
UM. The state of Oklahoma has now
in loans or available for loans nearly
$7,000,000. This will be augmented at
the rate of more than one half million
dollars per year frflta the common
school fuuds, and from $2W),00O to
$",00,000 each year from the college
funds. Both of these funds will ulti
mately amount to about $33,000,000
or $40,000,000. State competition, has
already resulted in lowering rates in
the state as much as 2 per cent which
means a saving to the borrowers of the
state in interest rates of $1,700,0H
each year, and when state competition
brings all companies to state rates the
saving will be at least double this
amount.
The commissioner of the land of
fice are endeavoring to so handle ths
funds as to bring about this result in
the shortest space of time. Not only
are those who borrow money of the
ptate at 5 par cent greatly benefited
but every person who Is forced to bor
row money is also being benefited by
the lower rates being forced by state
competition.
As long as there was only sufficieut
state money to supply the demands of
those who actually lived upon and cul
tivated their farms all other persons
were denied loaha. but the rapidly ac
cumulating funds went clear beyond
the demand of this class of borrowers,
hence the rules were ' liberalized so
that loans could be made to any on
who had the security and title provid
ed the same was not to be used for
speculative purposes cud whenever
the funds are reduced to the extent
that there is only money sufficient for
actual farmers the ruies will be re
considered and the preference given
to those who aitually farm the land.
The development of this country has
been more seriously retarded by high
interest rates than any other cause
and the competition forced by the
school land department will result in
the saving of millions of dollars ejth
year and enable the borrowers to pay
off loans already made and will also
enable thousands of people to borrow
money and pay for a home which ae
