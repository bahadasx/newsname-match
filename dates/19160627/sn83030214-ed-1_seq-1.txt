Irw-.n Kirkwood. committeeman

ba probably would enlist under the ,

Judge Nortoni, of St. Louis. who,

I the Hughea indorsement on all

London, June 27.- -Lieutenant Bil

The explorer ha? evidently returncd

increased in severity that he waa un- |
able to get nearer than twenty milea to ^

GERMANS STORM
CZAR'S TRENCHES
Rome Announces Gain on
Twenty-Mile Front
in Trentino.
IBy C__a to Ttia TrV ?
London, June 2fl. The long-heralded
and much-delayed grand offensive of
the Allies scems to be at hand. Indced,
if events rather than official announce
ments mark its opening, it ls already
well under way.
Paris and London have said nothing
regarding the important operBtions
now devcloping. It has been left to
admissions from the Central Powers to
establish their cxistence. Thua, as
against the silence of the British War
Office, Berlin this morning chronicled
the opening of "important battles" on
the acctor held by Sir Douglas Haig.
Vienna supplements this to-r.ight
with the ndmission of a twenty-mile
retirement in the Trentino. "To retain
our freedom of action" is the tribute
the Austrian War Office B-jra to (ien?
eral Cadorna's offensive, which observ
ers expect to apread rapidly to the
Isonzo front.
Russians Near Kolomea.
In the east the Russians, while still
held up in their advance on Kovel by
the Germans, are continuing their
progress against the Austnans in the
south. Their flank now protected by
the Carpathians, they have turned
northward in their swul-p through Bu
kowina and are approaching Kolomea.
They are already within ten miles of
the town.
Thus, though the Germans do succeed
in prevcnting progress from the north,
they may still force the evacuation of
Lemberg and Tarnapol from the south.
Similar tactics were successfu! when
the Russians took the city before.
To Rtem the Russian tide the Ger
mnns have taken over the defence of
the whole sector from Kovel down to
Brody. They have replaced the shat
tered ranks of the Archduke Frederick
with fresh regiments from the West
front, uho are ealled upon here ?o
undergo the same artillery hell they ex
penenced nt Verdun.
General Brunsiloff's main efforts are
now being devoted to ovtrthrowing the
Germans in these positions. He has
brought his batteries which routed the
Austrians to bear here. And, despite
being pushed back by six German as
saulta over a two-mile front yesterday,
he has driven a wedge so far in the
German iine at, to menace Brody.
Brland Vfsita Haig.
The aemi-ofneial Paria "Temps" also
voices the view that the Allies* offen?
sive is at hand. Its military expert,
regarded as one of the most competi-nt
in Lurope, declares that "the hour of
action for the Allies is here. Attack
succeeds defence on many fronts." It
sees especial signlficance in the visit of
Premier Briand to the hcadquartcrs of
Sir Douglas Haig, the British com
niander, on Saturday and Sunday.
The Allies' plan, as it is understood
here by military men, is not for any
combined assault on all fronts at once.
Instt-ad, they are perfectly content to
allow events to take their course, and
as weak links in the Teuton defence
disclosc themselves. strike with oTer
whelrning might.
Thi* strategy was agreed upon at the
Allied conference In Fans and was sub
sequently developed In greater detail
by General Joffre ln his recent cunfer
ences here with Sir Wiliiam Robertson,
British chief of staff. To aid in co
ordinating it with Russian plans is be>
lieved to have been the mission of Lord
Kitchener when he lost his life ln the
sinking of the Hampshire on the way
to Archangel.
The weakening of the Austrian lines
in Galicia for their assault in the Tren?
tino gave the Russians the tir.. oppor
tunity to take the otfensive. With their
successes here, the Teutons were forced
to withdraw troops from the Italian
and Waatara fronts. Now the Italians,
in turn, hBve resumi-d the a'tar-4.
Tha Germans hav- heen llawar in
witbdrawing men irom the French front
becauso thry know of the fortnuiable
massmg of troops that has been going
on behind the Anglo-r rench lines. Mili
tnry observers ileclari- that the Veraun
assault has been prolonged in order to
fores'.all any Allied orTensive. Afaiaat
the British portion of tho front aione
it is estimated that the Germans have
maintained in reserve no less than
700,000 man.
That these at last are being
drawn, etthar IB throw into the final
Itfoii OB the Meuse or to stay the Rus?
sian drive. seems to be the meaning of
the "important battlts" which Berlin
records as developing from the Vier
to the Sorame.

I'nits of the New York National

will quit Ita armory at 11 o'ciock th'-i
morning and go to Jeraey City, where it
will entrain in four sections at the

14th Infantry, of Brooklyn, now ut
Peekakill. Will leave there on the Nev
York Central at 8 o'ciock this morning.
The 47th of Hrooklyn will entrain at
noon.
Just what caused the delay has not
delinitely been announced. General
(i'1'.ynri last night said that the troops
bad been held up by the railroads, whila
the railroads deelared they were ready'
to trannport the men as soon as they
could board thc trains.
"The National Guard eannot con -
mandecr the railroads." General O'Ryan
said. "The rushmg of men to the bor?
der is not as urgent as the ru.shin>* of
men to the battle front in turope -/as
at thc opening of the war.
"lt is not neeessary for us to over

"Wewu'ld entrain the troops within
thirty seconds, for the cars are al
ready for theaa now. As soon aa they
?re aboard we can start them on their

The New York Central P.arlroad made
practically the aanae statement
Owing to lack of surhru-nt steel
?quipment tp handle such a.large num?
ber of men the 7th will be taken o
the Jer-ey City terminal on ferryboats
and will there be entratned on wooden

Boyd on "Peaceful and
Permissible Mis
sion," They Say.
Field Headquarters, June 26 ivia
wireless to Columbus, N. ML). It was
both a peaceful and permissible mis
sion in which the two troops of the 10th
Cavalry, commanded by Captain Charles
Boyd, were engagcd upon when they
fought Carranza troops at Carrizal last
Wednesday, according to the view ex
pressed to-day by officers with (ieneral
Pershing's column.
It was peaceful, they declared, be
cause all the Vnited States troops' cani
paigning had been done in expectation
of cooperation by Carranza soldiers,
'and permissible beeause no limitations
had been agred upon by the two gov
ernments which would restrict patroll
ing by the Americans.
When General Jacinto Trevino's
warning that his men would flre upon
American troops moving in any direc
tion except north reached the expedi
tionary forces they were moving north
gradually, in expectation that Carranza
force* would occupy the territory ;vae
uated and poliee it.
In the mean time patrols were sent
out on either side of the American col
umns for protective and observatory
purposes. They moved in whatever di
rection tneir immediate duties re
quired. The Carrizal patrol was one of
them.
Captain Morey's Story.
The American negro troopers faced
almost certain death at Carrizal with
smiles on their lips, and they burst into
rong once or twice as they fought their
grim light against odds, is the story
told by Captain I.ewis S. Morey, when
he Brrived at Said headquarters to-day.
"I-'or l.'i minutes the men fought, jok
ing among thenm-lves all the while,
even though they rea'.ized we had heen
trnpped nnd had little ehance of getting
out alive," he said.
Captain Morey said he had never
seen such valor as was displayed by
Captain Charles T. Boyd in leading a
handful of dismounted skirmishers
through the machine gun flre and into
the ambush of death. He added that
it was nut until their ammunition was
exhausted that the troops were finally
cut to nieces, and told of the heroic
death ot Lieufenant Henry R. Adair, of
Portland. i?re, la an attempt to re- ,
plenish it.
Lieutenant Adair died fighting, his'
last words being, "Go on, sergeant," to
a non-commissioned offieer at his side,
Captain Morey said. The two were on
their way to the pack animals carrying
the ammunition when they were in
tercepted near a smali imgation ditch
by a detail of the Mexicans.
Fought Intil Killed.
Lieutenant Adair had already been
wounded and had lost his pistol in the
previous tighting, but he had borrowed
ui.other and was RffctlBg a hand-to
hand battl-- when ba was killed. He
fell unconscious and was caught by
the negro sergeant as he alid toward
the d.tch. wh.ch was deeply lilled with
4i.ater. The sergeant held Adair in his
arri?. his face above the water. ur.til
r.r iioi, the wounded offieer reviving
only long enough to whisper irders to |
leave him and finish the mission.
Captain Morey saul that Captain Boyd
warned the men before the fight that
they were edvancing into the greates'.

ARWY CLOSING
ON PERSHING
Carranza Troops Mas
singin Positions Men
acing Americans.
[Bj T*l**Tiph to Th? Trtbune ]
EI Paso, June 26. Advices from
Mexican sources to-night tell of con
tinued coi.cciitration of Carranza troops
in positions to menace the American
army. Stretched along the Mexican
Central and Mexieo Northwestern rail
roads at points where Mexican com
manders think General Pershing would
be likely to attempt seizure of the two
lines, large bodies of Mexican troops
have been massed. The defiant an
nouncement has been given out that
the Americans will not be permitted to
move a mile from the Colonia Dublan
base, except toward the border.
Immediately after the evacuation of
San Geronimo and Bachinaba by Amer?
ican troops, General Jacinto Trevino
occupied these points and iisued strict
orders that any attempts of General
| Pershing's men to retum aouth must
be forcibly preventtd.
Bloodleas vlctories OTer the Ameri*
can forces are being claimed by Mexi?
can army officers in their reports to
the Mexican War Department, through
General Trevino.
Believe Perehlng Is Retiring.
Becausa General Pershing, for strate
gic reasons, has concentrated hia forces
ut Colonia Dublan, abandonmg former
positions at Namiquipa, San Antonio
and EI Valle, Mexican commanders as
sert the Americans are retiring for
tear of being attacked by Mexican
forces. The Mexicans have reoccupied
all the abandoned camps.
The Mexicans have Deen exulting
over what they have been told is a re
treat of the entirj American force, and
they contulently expect Getaeral Per?
shing's army to leave Mexieo.
Mean while, General Pershing's force
is ready for action, if action is neces
sary. About 12,000 men, in spk-ndid
righting trim, compose hia army. Re
piurs from the front indicate the high
est morale among the men.
Equipment has tveen put in the best
of condition. Horsei and mules have
been tested until only the flt and strong
remain. Big motor trains, loaded with
the necessary supplies for an advance,
are lined up.
Every empty truck which remained
at Columbus has been sent to the front
to aid in the apeedy transportation of
infantry.
With the lines of the Amaricana and
Mexicans parellelling for at least one
hundred and rifty miles the rash action
of some subordinate commander, it Is
considered here, might at any time em
broil the main eommand before the ex
changes between Washington and Mex?
ieo City are considered.
Commanders Redouble Vlgllance.
Eears that events might be thus hast
en*d prompted border commanders to
redouble their vigilance to-day. At all
points soldiers were ready to apring
into action at a moment's notice. Troop
dispositions were made with a view tn
meeting sudden and unexpected emer
geneiea.
Word was received at headquarters
at S'an Antonio to-day that a force of
flfteen hundred Mexican troops had ar
rived opposite Naco, Ariz., and were be?
ing held in trains at that point. It was
announced at headquarters to-night
that reinforcementi had been sent to
the Naco garnson. The point from
which these troops were sent was with
held.
To provide for handling wounded ar.d
sick soldiers in Mexieo and on the bor?
der extensive preparations were started
in EI Paso to-day by officers of the
medical corps. All wounded and aic'<
soldiers in field hospitals in Mexieo are
being brought to Kort Bliss to relieve
General Pershing of the handicap of
having to care for them if hostilitlea
open.
The Eort Bliss base hospital is being
doubled in capacity. Eeases are being
taken on hospital buildings and houses
suitable for hospital purposes. Hos?
pital corps preparations are under way
I r extraordir.ary tield service, and Red
Cross organuations are preparing for
field service. Provistons are to be made
here. it ia underatood, to care for two
thousand wounded at a time, and addt
tional facllities will be available at Co
lumbuf
Report of Fight Tnconflrmed.
A report was current at Columbus to
day that another clash of American anj
Carranza troops had oceurred in the vl
nrity of Villa Ahumada. Army officers
there have r.ot confirmed it_
Mexican officiala in EI Paao and
Juarez said they had heard nothing of
fighting at Villa Ahumada or any other
point.
Reports that General Al'redo Rieaut,
commander of the Matamoros garnson,
had been replaced by General E. P.
Nafarrate were not credited to-day by
Mexican Cor.sul Josa Garza, at i olum

American Note Reaches Mexico City, but

[From The Tribune Bureau.]
Washington. June 26.?No mediation?nor any other move
to preserve peace with Mexico?is possible until Carranza ha-s
replied to Secretary Lansing's not6 of Sunday, released ^he pris
oner? taken at Carrizal and retracted or explained, if he can, the
hostile orders given to General Trevino.
This is the conviction among Latin-.\merican diplomats
here to-night, following the eonference of Ignacio Calderon,
Minister from Bolivia, with Secretary Lansing. They have not
relaxed their efforts, however, and since they still hope that
mediation of the general situation il possible if the immediate
crisis is passed safely, are bringing heavy pressure to bear on
Carranza to meet the .American demands.
The Administration is marking time, awaiting the First
Chief's reply, but is continuing to strain every nerve in prepara
tion for possible eventualities. So new orders have gone to the
militia, but the order to go as soon as ready has been interpreted
in a way to hasten the movement of troops.

courier fto Columbus, N. M., June 'JO
Francisco Villa was shot fr >m the rear
by a Mexican he had impresaed into h;s
gang during* the battle with Carranza
troops at Guerrero, but his fate atill is
unknown.
This information was contained in a
semi-offlcial account obtained by Major
Robert L Howre, who was cloae on
Villa's train last April, and given out
here to-day.
Major How-e learned tne details of
th* woundmg* of the bandit chieftain
from one of the Mexicans Villa drafted
and who afterwi.nl de>*rted.
The details of the .-tory agreed with
facts American offkers obtained in their
pursuit of Villa and by their inde
pendent Secret Service work, but the
account does not say whether the ban?
dit died or recovered.
Villa. tne llexieaa deserter uaid, ex
hibited every evidence of terror during
the early stages of his flight, after the
Atr.er.cans had defeated his men at
Guerrero. The informant said he be?
lieved Villa waa dea 1, but, if he still
were alive, he was in the State of Dv
rango, for which point he was headmg
in hii flight from General Per-hing'a
men.
GERMANY DENIES
INTRIGUE IN MEXICO
Only Keeping on Good Terms
with Carranza, Says Offkial.
Berlin, June 26. From a hrjr'-.ly eom
petent source The Associated Press to
day received BOthoi '? to deny eom
plete'.y tales which have reached here
from the t'nited States intimating tha*
tne (ierman Lepation in Mexico City ia
inapiring General t'arranza to hostility
to the I'nited States.
"That is an unmitigated he," said an
offleiel, when these reporta were called
to his attention. "We recognued Car
rar.ra because the Unitad State, asked
ua to, and have no further iiterest in
the question. Once he was reco..
it was natural that our repreaentative
should keep on good terms with the
head of the government and maintain
frttndly relation with him. but that

An informal embargo has been es
tablished, which prevents Mexieo
from getting from this country not
only arms and munitions, but food
stufTs and any other material that
might be uscd for an army.
The Senate to-day passed the
militia draft resolution, after defeat
mg an attempt by Senator Sherman
to include in it a statement that & I
"state of war exists."
Awaiting Morey's Report.
Reports from General Pershing to
day increased the number of those
who have returned to safety to one
officer and forty-three men, while an?
other man is said to have started to
return to the base by another route.
This lcavea the t.'tal missinj? at
twenty-two, if there are seventeen
prisoners, and tifteen if there are
twenty-four, ajt has been reported
but not contirmed.
The one officer il Captain Morey,
and it will be on his report that the
Administration must depend for the
version of the C-trixal affair which
it will uphold. The letter from him
published thi.-- morning has not yet
reached the War Department in offi?
cial form.
Unoffioially, officers admitted that
his statement that the American
troops advanced on the Mexicans in
battle formation, and that Captain
Boyd thought the Mexicans would
retire when the first shot was fired,
gave color to the Mexican charge
that the provoeation had como from
the American side.
It is insisted, however, that the quee?
tion between the governments does not
depend on the defails of the I arrizal
a**"a:r, but on the hostile attitude which
Carranza has assumed toward the
Aaaaricaa troops and t'ne bellicose or?
dera which he has i?su?d. However
the blame may lie in the Carrizal
claah, the fact that the Mexican eol
diera were looking for trouble is held
retponiible, ar.d war can only be avert
r4 by a change in the Mexican attitude.
Cnlte-d Statea Position Made Clear.
The word "mediation" was not us?d
in Minister Calderon'a conference with
.-'??rretary I.ansing thia afternoon, but
?h* Secre'ary, r,everthel*BB, made it
? <*ar to the minister that mediation at
this time is Impoaaibla They discussed
the situation ger.erally, and the 'atti?
tude of this govemment was outl.ned
in unm.sta'aab'.e term-i.
Immediately after the conference Mr.
--^n reported its result? to othejr
I.atin-American diplomats who ar* 'eady
ta join with him ir. .nediation. They
were greatly disappointed that thia
country had taken so ftrm a stand, and
The Tribune iearned after the con?
ference that they believed the aituation
?a serious and felt that a war would be
so disastrous that they had decided to
continue their efforts, directing them
now toward Carrania.
They ?t:ll hope that if the Immediate
ensis can be passed thia country will
aci-ept mediation on the more general
issues, and are directing all their ener
gies toward inducmg the Mexican ehief
to gr<-.nt the American demands.
If this is done and they are not very
hopetul they will again offer media?
tion, but they believe the border aitua?
tion is so de'icata that unleaa lomi
?rease<i_- be iouad lt will e__j ba a ?attar
