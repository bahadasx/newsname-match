Colonel Formally Dec'ines Nom
ination By Progressives
Will SUPPORT G.O.P. NOMINEE
Third Ticket Would Be Move in the
Interest of the Election of
Wilson
Chicago, June 27. Theodore Roose
velt, in a letter read to the progressive
national committee in session here
yesterday, finally declined to accept
the presidential nomination of the par
ty and strongly urges the organization
to support Charles E. Hughes. The
colonel's letter was read by Oscar King
Davis, secretary of the committee. In
this letter Colonel Roosevelt said:'
"In my judgment, the nomination of
Mr. Hughes meets the conditions set
forth in the statement of the Progres
sive national committee, issued last
January, and in my own statements.
Under existing conditions, the nomina
tion of a third ticket would, in my
judgment, be merely a move in the in
terest of the election of Mr. Wilson.
' I regard Mr. Hughes as a man
whose public record is a guarantee
that he will not merely stand tor a
program of cleancut straightout Ameri
canism before election, but will reso
lutely and in good faith put in through
if elected. He Is beyond all com pari
son better fitted to be president than
Mr. Wilson. It would be a grave detri
ment to the country to re-elect Mr. Wil
son. I shall, therefore, strongly sup
port Mr. Hughes."
"Mr. Hughes has shown In his career
the instinct of efficiency which will
guarantee that, under him, the govern
ment will once more work with vigor
and force. He possesses that habit
of straightforward thinking which
means that his words will be correlat
ed with his deeds and translated into
facts. His past career is the warrant
for our belief that he will be the un
faltering opponent of that system of
Invisible government which finds ex
pression In the domination of the party
boss and the party machine.
"His past career is a guarantee that
whatever he says before election will
be made good by his acts after elec
tion. Morally, his public record shows
him to be a man of unbending integri
ty; intellectuality, it shows him to be
a man of original and trained ability.
We have the alternative of continuing
in office an administration which has
proved a lamentable failure, or of put
ting into office an administration
which we have every reason to believe
will function with efficiency for the in
terest and honor of all our people. I
earnestly bespeak from my fellow Pro
gresslves their ungrudging support of
Mr. Hughes."
Responsibility Placed by Message
on Capt. Boyd's Body
AMERICANS FEARED TREACHERY
Mexican Statements That Cavalrymen
Attempted to Take Carrlzal
Refuted.
Washington, June 2C Secretary
I laker announced to day that a mess
age had been found on the body of
Ciint. ("has. T. Boyd, who died fight
ing at Carrizal, which virtually proves
that the American cavalrymen were on
a peaceful mission when the fight with
Cananzlstas was precipitated.
The message is in the form of a car
bon copy of a communication wnicn
Cant. Boyd addressed to the Mexican
officials at Carrizal requesting the
usual permission for the American
troops to pass through the town and
asking that the proper military an
thorities be notified.
It lends strong support to the state
ments already made by other Ameri
can troopers that the Carranzistas
treacherously attacked the little party
of American troopers after permission
had been granted to them to enter Car
rizal. It is at least evident that Capt. lloyd
sought this permission in the usual
way and thereby clearly indicated that
hs troops had no intention of violat
ing instructions or of acting independ
ently of the Mexican military authori
ties. I loth at the State Department
and the War Department the message
found on Capt. Boyd's body is regarded
as highly important evidence. Inci
dentally it completely disproves, otli
cials say, the statement made by Mexi
cans that the American troops tried to
attack and take the town of Carrizal or
any part of it.
JAMES H. KELLEY DEAD
Life Long Resident Passed Away at
Home on Grove St. This Afternoon
James H. Kelley, a life long resident
of Bennington, committed suicide at
his home on Grove street this fore
noon. During the past five years he
had been helpless from rheumatism
and hardening of the arteries. Recent
ly a nervous breakdown was added tn
his afflictions and his hopeless condi
tion so preyed upon his mind that he
had been irresponsible for some
months. Late this forenoon he was
found in his room dead. The unfor
tunate man had succeeded in ending his
troubles with a cord from his bath
robe. James Henry Kelley was the son of
Edward Kelley. He was born in Ben
nington 03 years ago and with the ex
ception of about two years when he
was employed on a railroad in Troy he
had passed his entire life in the vil
lage. He had worked as a dyer for
the Cooper Manufacturing company
but for a number of years proceeding
his illness he had been a member of
the police force and the village night
watchman.
He always maintained an interest
in town and village politics and, al
though a large number of his associ
ates were of the opposite party, his ac
tivity never engendered animosity on
the part of those with whom he dif
fered. Klndhearted and generous,
faithful to his friends under all cir
cumstances, the news of his tragic end
will be received with sincere regret in
the community with which he had been
identified for so many years.
He was three times married. The
family survivors are a widow who was
Mrs. Emma Conant, two daughters,
Mrs. Adeline Daley of New York and
Mrs. Margaret Trowbridge of Troy,
four sons, Edward Leo, James W.,
Thomas J., and William M., of Kenning
ton and a sister, Mrs. Frank Butter
field who resides in this village.
Tho arrangements for the Itinera1
have not been made.

Lansing Insists Carranza Must Deliver
U. S. Priconers.
Washington, June 20. Through Ig
nacio Culderon, Minister from Bolivia,
the Latin American diplomats in Wash
ington were given to understand today
by Secretary Lansing that the United
States was not disposed at this time
to entertain any proposals of mediation
between this Government and Mexico.
Although discouraged by the rebuff,
the Latin American representatives at
conferences among themselves later
in the day agreed to ask their Govern

satisfactory answer as possible to the
demand for the release of the prison
ers held at Chihuahua and for a state

SQUIRRELS MIGHT GET THEM
New York, June 27. Charles E.
Hughes, republican nominee for presi
dent, sent a telegram to O. K. Davis
secretary of the progressive national
committee, last night welcoming the
support of the progressive party and
arraigning the present administration
for its "weakness and incertitude."
In making public the contents of the
telegram, Mr. Hughes also gave out a
letter he had written to Theodore
Roosevelt, in which ho declared tho na
Hon was Indebted to Mr. Roosevelt
"for tho quickening of the national
pplrlt and for the demand for an out
find-out 100 per cent Americanism."
The candidate told Mr. Roosevelt
that he had "sounded forth the trum
!et that shall never call retreat, and I
want you to feel that I wish to have all
the aid you are able and willing to give
.we. The letter closed with an ex
pression of a wish by Mr. Hughes to
see Mr. Roosevelt soon.
The telegram to Secretary Davis
was in response to a telegram from
the secretary notifying Mr. Hughes
that the progressives at Chicago yes
terday had Indorsed him. "1 welcome
tho Bupport of progressives," Mr
iiughes messago read. "We make
common cause I ntho interest of na
tional honor, of national security, of
national efficiency. We unite in tho
demand for an undivided and unwa
vering loyalty to our country, and
for a whole-hearted patriotic devotion
overriding all racial differences. We
want a revival of the American spirit
a nation restored. We Insist upon
prompt and adequate provision for
tho common defense: upon tho stead
fast maintenance of all tho rights of
our citizens and upon the integrity of
international law.
"I am deeply appreciative of your
indorsement. I find no difference in
platform or In aim which precludes
tho most hearty co-operation and the
most complete unity. It is within tho
party that the liberalizing spirit you
invoke can have tho widest und most

peare's death has been and is being

Many Spanish-American War Vets Ex
pect to Enlist.
New York, June 2G. The first negro
regiment in this state is in process of
organization under the direction of
Public Service Commissioner William
Hayward. Mr. Hayward, who hold8 a
commission as colonel in the reserve
militia, lias been asked by Governor
Whitman to take charge of a move
ment which has been planned for some
time by a number of leaders among
the negroes here. Recruiting offices
will bo opened this week.
There are many negro Spanish-American
war veterans in New York, and
the officers think that a number of
these men will enter the new organi
zation. No color lino will be drawn in
the final appointment of officers.
Efficiency is to be the sole considera
tion. If the present plans are carried out,
the regiment when organized will con
sist of twelve companies of infantry,
one machine gun company, one supply
company, one headquarters company
and a band. Tho band is already ar
ranged for through the co-operation of
Europe's Orchestra, which has long
been playing for dances In New York.
Although both in the civil and Spanish-American
wars New Y'ork was rep
resented by colored troops, they have
never been organized as a distinctive
ly New York force. At the time of
the civil war an effort was made to
form a New York regiment, but Gov.
Horatio Seymour refused to authorize
the organization and the negroes went
in as national volunteers.

TO LIFT TAX ON TIMBER LAND
Field Headquarters, Mexico, June 20.
via wireless to Columbus, N. M., June
20. American negro troopers faced al
most certain death at Carrizal with
smiles on their lips and they burst into
song once or twice as they lought their
grim fight against odds. Is the story
told by Captain Lewis T. Morey when
he arrived at field headquarters today.
"For forty-five minutes the men
fought, joking among themselves all
the while, even though they realized
we had been trapped and had little
chance of getting out alive," he said.
vaptain .Morey said he had never
seen such valor as was displayed by
lapiain haries l. isoyd in leading a
handful of dismounted skirmishers
through the machine gun fire and into
the ambush of death. He added that
it was not until their ammunition was
exhausted that the troop was finally
cut to pieces, and he told of the heroic
death of Lieutenant Henry R. Adair of
Portland Ore., in an attempt to replen
ish it.
Lieutenant Adair died fighting, his
last words being, "Go on, sergeant," to
a non-commissioned officer at his side,
Captain Morey said.
Tho two were on their way to the
pack animals carrying the ammunition

small irrigation ditch by a detail of the
Mexicans. Lieutenant Adair had al
ready been wounded and had lost his
pistol in the previous fighting, but he

caught by the negro sergeant as he
slid toward the ditch which was deep

LEFT TODAY FOR
EAGLE PASS
Infantry Regiment Now on Way to
Mexican Border
CAVALRY TO GO WHEN EQUIPPED
Guardsmen Must Travel in Ordinary
Coaches as No Other Cars Are
Available.
Burlington, June 27. The Vermont
national guard, about 900 strong, is
today on its way to Eagle Pass, Tex.
The order for the troops to entrain was
received at midnight but there was a
delay owing to the Inability of the
transportation companies to provide
the necessary cars at an earlier hour.
When it became known yesterday
morning that the regiment was under
orders to leave for the Mexican border
Burlington planned to give the soldiers
a royal send-off and at 4.30 o'clock this
afternoon, headed by the Sherman
band, 100 automobiles, decorded with
the Stars and Stripes, as many teams,
motorcycles, bicycles and hundreds of
persons on foot, nearly everybody and
every equipage adorned with red, vhite
and blue, paraded up Church and Pearl
streets to Winooski and thence to the
camp ground.
The crowd that came to say good
bye did not all come from Burlington.
Many came from Rutland. St. Albans,
Montpelier, llarre, Northfield and oth
er places to wish God speed to tho
men who have responded to their coun
try's call.
Adjt. Gen. Tillotson had planned to
send the men on their southern jour
ney in tourist cars that they might
sleep ns they sleep at home but in
this he was disappointed as the best
transportation equipment that can be
provided will be ordinary railroad
coaches.
The Massachusetts and New Hamp
shire regiments will have no better
equipment and the Vermonters are not
complaining.
The train travels In four sections.
The first carries the heavy baggage
and includes wagons loaded on flat cars
one large automobile truck and the
horses. The remaining sections con
vey the troops, their personal baggage
and tho rations.
The regiment Is equipped with five
day rations. This Is significant as
meaning that the regiment will be on.
the way five days before reaching its
destination. At Binghamton, N. Y..
shoes and socks will be taker aboa'rd
the train. These are being sent by ex
press from some, point to intercept the
train at this point.
The route will be to Brattlcboro,
East Northfield, Mass., Mechanicvllle,
Binghamton. N. Y., Chicago, Kansas
City, San Antonio and Eagle Pass,
Tex. At the destination the Vermont

regiments and it is hoped with regi
ments from other eastern stales. The

corps, composed of Major Watson,
Captain Walter L. Eastman and Cap
tain L. A. Hall, and the inspector gen

strong. There will be a number of
men left behind owing to lack of equip
meat but as soon as they are supplied
they will be hurried to the southern
destination.
A small detail of Infantry and the
cavalry will also remain and enlisting
will continue. As soon as the cavalry,
known ns tho Norwich cadets, is
brought upHo required numbers it
will be hurried southward. Fifteen
of the cadets failed to take the oath
owing to their age and tho reluctance
of parents to give consent. President
Wilson's order for the mobilization of
rtate troops was issued under the old
law governing the national guards but
the oath taken was under the new
law which calls for six years' service,
three years ot active service and threo
in the reserve line.
