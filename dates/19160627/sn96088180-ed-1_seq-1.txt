IJOREY TELLS STORY OF
M
ON
Field Headquarters (via Radio .to
Columbus, N. M), June 27. Captain
Lewis S. Morey of troop K, ot the
Tenth . cavalry, the aole officer to
survive the fight with Carranilsta
forces near Carrlsal, today sat on
the edge of his bunk In the thatched
hut that Is the headquarters ot the
American forces and told an atten
tive group of fellow officers the de
tails or the first real tragedy of this
campaign..
Captain Morey had spent the night
In the hospital after his arrival .here
by automobile Sunday. Today, with'
his bloodstained shirt removed and
his body refreshed and cleaned, he
was able to be about camp with bis
left shoulder, through which a
Mauser bullet passed, swathed In
bandages.
He first visited General Pershing,
then visited , the regiment In what
will probably be one of the most re
markable reunions of the campaign.
As he walked through the company
streets, flanked by tents and curious
ly woven bruBh huts, quarters that
men and officers have built, there was
no cheering, no music, but from each
group he passed some officer with
eager fare' stepped forth and grasped
Morey'a unmalmed'hand, exclaiming
"Glad you're back; congratulations."
Those were simple words, but they
were rervent, for no man of this com
mand had believed Morey would ever
be with them again.
Captain Morey told bis story slow
ly, with superb restraint and modesty.
Me blamed 'no one, drew no conclu
sions and offered no suggestions as
to what should have been done.
He added little to the tale or the
fight; except to say that Captain Boyd
and Lieut. Henry Adair died like men
and that In the firing that followed
the Mexican attack the Carranslstas
seemed to be centering their fire on
the white soldiers. ' 1 '

Republican National Cc
tee Selects Choice of Can
didate Hughes as Chairman
at Meeting b New Ycrk
New York, J una 27. William R.
Wlllcox, or New York, was this after
noon named chairman ot the repub
lican national committee.
The selection of Wlllcox was1 an
nounced following a 45-mlnute con
ference between Candidate Charles
E. Hughes and the steering commit
tee of the national committee, head
ed by W. Murray Crane.
Wlllcox first came Into promin
ence as the most likely candidate for
Hughes' campaign, director two weeks
ago. Others have been mentioned as
possibilities and various state lead
ers have urged "favorite sons," but
Wlllcox has generally been consider
ed most likely to be the final selec
tion jlnce his name first appeared.
WlllCox waa formerly chairman of tba
New York public service commission.
He was the first man to call on
Hughes at. bis hotel hero when the
candidate came, to New York follow
ing his resignation from tbe supreme
'bench. - ' ' v:--
Moray's troop was. on the right
flank when the "ball opened," as be
expressed It, and be could follow the
charge of troop C under Boyd and
Adair only to the fringe ot tbe brush
Into . which men and horses disap
peared. "Men of troop C tell me," he aald,
"that Lieut Adair died In an irriga
tion ditch with his head held by a
non-commissioned offioer. There
was water in the ditch and Adair
would have pitched forward Into it
had he not been stopped. I under
stand the non-commissioned officer
left Adair In the ditch at bis order
and went forward toward Carrlsal.
Looking back, he saw Adair with
glased eyes and his head wobbling
against the, sides of the ditch. So
he went back and stayed with .him
until he died.
"Captain Boyd was killed when
his troops made a rush for the trench
In which the Carranxistas had ma
chine guns. Just how be died I do
not know."
Morey told how his own small de
tachment, fighting on their bellies,
withdrew until Morey, wounded In
the shoulder, found himself with
seven men behind an adobe wall
near a dry water hole offering pro
tection from bullets but not from the
sun. . .
Three hundred yards to the south
were the Carranslstas, some mount
ed and some afoot, firing and yell
ing as they advanced, emboldened- by
the Americana' retirement.
"When I got behind the wall.", re
sumed Morey, "I told the men I pur
posed to stay there. Those who wish
ed to go, 1 told to go."
Four men, including one who was
wounded, elected to try to escspe
and Captain Morey said he saw them

ing, in removing his base from Nami-

mated any attempt by the Carran

the separate oamps strung along the
former .' line : ' ot communications.

that before the line was shortened

gaps, sub-bases being 35 miles apart.
