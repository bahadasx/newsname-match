GETTING THE SITE HEADY
FOH THE NEW DEPOT.
P. D. Schemmcrhom, supervisor of
uruige3 anu buildings arrived from
Omnha yestorday afternoon and at once
began making arrangements for get
ting ready the site for the now depot.
Ho Instructed Foreman Murphy to
secure all the men possible to level the
old depot site preparatoryHo removing
thereto tho building now standing In
the park, where It will remain until
tho new depot Is completed. Mr. Mur
phy Is hustling Cor men this forenoon,
but as laborers In town are pretty well
employed It Is probable that It will bo
necessary to ship In men. The hotel
site will be leveled to within two feet
of the surface of the ground, and this
depression will later be filled with
soli and become part of the park
grounds. Tho building at present
used as a depot will bo moved about
forty feet west. Tho moving of this
building as .well as tho dispatchers
building will probably be let to a lo
cal contractor. The freight depot will
be moved about a block east, but this
will not be done until tho other pre
paratory work Is completed.
It is undorstood the depot plans aro
now in the nanus of contractors and
bids for tho construction will be sub
mitted in a short time.

For several years Mrs. Lucas had suf
fered with asthma and heart trouble
and last" fall contracted pneumonia
from which she was since affected, and

accompanied with intense pain. Less
than a week ago she was taken ill and
had been bedfast until Sunday morn
ing, when she seemed to bo stronger
and requested that she bo allowed to

schools for some time. Sho was a
charter member of Chapter AK of the
P. E. O., and faithfully worked in their
interests. On account of falling health
for some time past she was obliged ,to
discontinue active work in the church
and societies, much to tho regret of
the members, who realized her ef
ficiency and appreciated her untiring
efforts for their welfare.
