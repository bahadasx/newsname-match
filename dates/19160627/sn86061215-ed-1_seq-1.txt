TAKEN IN FIGHT
De Facto President Told to
Make Plain His Order
to Resist Soldiers
CLASH AT CARRIZAL
NOT BASIS OF NOTE
American Troops Considered
Partly Responsible for
Recent Engagement
Washington, D. C., June 29.—
8outh and Central American* re
public* wfll not offer mediation to
the United States In the Mexican
crisis at this time. This announce
ment was made late today by
Minister Calderon of Bolivia after
a conference with Secretary Lan
sing.
Chihuahua City, Mexico, June
26.—On the heels of the American
evacuation of San Geronimo and
Bachinaba, Gen. Jacinto Trevino
has occupied these points with
his troops, issuing strict ordere
that any attempt of Gen. Persh
ing's men to return south must be
forcibly prevented.
Columbus, N. M, June 26.—A
report was In circulation here to
day that another clash of Ameri
can and Carranzista troops had
occurred near Villa Ahumada but
army officers here have not con
firmed it.
Washington, D. C., June 26.—
A virtual embargo on commerce
between the United States and
Mexico pending determination of
their future relatione Is being
planned by the administration.
Washington, D. CL June 36.—Wheth
er a state of war shall exist between
the United States and the de facto
government of Mexico depends upoif
the formal declaration of policy by
Gen. Carranza, expected hourly today
in response to the note telegraphed to
Mexico City yesterday by Secretary
L&nsipg.
The American government will as
sist upon Immediate release of the
cavalrymen captured at Carrizal, as
demanded in the note, but high offi
cials of the administration explain in
interpreting the communication that
the course of the United ^States will
be determined by Carranza's final
statement of his intentions toward the
American expedition in Mexico to pro
tect the border.
ilting Morey's Letter.
The war department had not receiv
ed at an early hour the letter from
Capt. Lewis S. Morey of the tenth cav
alry giving the first official American
version'of the fighting at Carrizal.
The published text of Capt. Morey's
leter was construed as indicating that
the American force was to some extent
responsible for the clash.
Secretary Lansing's note, however,
did not found its demands upon a
statement that the Mexicans pre
cipitated the fight. Apparently, the
Question has no direct connection with
the course President Wilson is pur
suing. The Mexican note saying Gen.
Carranza personally directed that Gen.
Trevino resist any movement of
American troops in Mexico except in
retirement toward the border, is the
real issue.
Hostilities Ordered?
The Washington government con
strues this action as a formal avowal
of deliberately hostil action. It de
mands that if this is Carranza's pur
pose, he so state through regular
diplomatic channels.
Members of congress were Informed
of all phases of the situation during
the day by the chairmen of the for-!
eign affairs committees, who had a
long conferenoe with the president
last night. The president then indi
cated that he might desire to address
the house and senate soon but no
•teps toward arranging for a joint
session will be taken until the Car
ranza reply is received.

MEXICANS TAKING
POSITION SOUTH
OF BORDER LINE
TOWNS OF THE RIO GRANDE BE
INQ STRIPPED OF ALL SOL
DIERS AND STORES.
San Antonio, Tex., June 26.—News
reaching army headquarters here to
day indicates that the Mexican forces
along the Rio Grande from MatamoroB
to Juarez either have withdrawn their
main strength from the border or are
preparing to do it. It also is indicat
ed that they are/ taking station at
strategic points along a line well
south of the border where railroad
junctions allow of rapid handling of
troops or where theHopography of the
country would permit of a strong de
fense.
Their reported new line parallels the
course of the Rio Grande and would
command the Mexican lines of ad
vance toward the strategic points of
Monterey and Saltlllo, the Coahuila
coal mines, which furnish the main
fuel supply of Mexico, and on which
locomotive movements depend Pare
don, the main railroad junction point
between Monterey and Saltillo and
Torreon, which probably will be the
main Mexican base, and Chihuahua
City.
Garleone Mere Shells.
The Mexican garrisons at Matamor
os, Nuevo Laredo and Juarez are said
to be mere shells. Only a negligible
force is said to be stationed opposite
Del Rio and the strongest force along
the border, that at Piedras Negras,
opposite Eagle Pass, Is reported pre
paring to evacuate at a moment's no
tice. The force at Piedras Negras is
commanded by Gen. Francisco Mur
gia, whom Gen. Carransa Is said to
have had difficulty In controlling in
times past
Gen. Funston'B force along the bor
der Is ready and waiting. Unless
some overt act of the de facto gov
ernment Bhould occur, a movement
will *me only at the express direc
tion of officials at Washington. Army
officers believe that should negotia
tions with the Carranza government
be long continued, feeling among the
Mexicans would cause some act that
must precipitate a clash.
Threat Not Idle One.
Army officers are convinced that
Gen. Jacinto Trevlno's statement that
he would attack American troops ap
proaching OJo Caliente and San An
tonio was not an empty threat and are
awaiting anxiously more news of the
two squadrons of the eleventh cav
alry sent toward Carrizal. Some con
jecture has been caused as to the iden
tity of the American troops reported
approaching thesq places as there are
five places named Ojo Caliente in that
part of Chihuahua and San Antonio is
also a common name for the villages
there.
VILLA WIThTCARRANZA.
El Paso, Tex., June 26. —Informa
tion reached here today froin apparent
ly reliable sources that Francisco
Villa, until recently at Santa Rosalio,
had reached an agreement with the de
facto government and that this was
being used to Induce his followers to
join the Carransa forces.
PERSHING'S FORCE
IS READYTOFIGHT
El Paso, Tex., June 26.—Gen. John
J. Pershing's punitive expeditionary
force is ready for Action if action is
necessary.
Today, according to the best inform
mation here, his southermost outpost
is near El Valle, less than fifty miles
from Colonla Dublan, the main base.
It is believed that from El Valle a
large and mobile force may be point
ed eastward, in a strategic position
toward the Mexican Central railroad.
Pershing's men number about 12,000.
Equipment is in excellent condition.
Horses and mules have been tested
until only the fit remain. Big motor
trains loaded with necessary supplies
for an advance are lined up.
There is not a Bingle wounded or
incapacitated man with the force.
Every empty truck which remained
at Columbus has been sent to the
front to aid in the speedy transporta
tion of infantry.

Five thousand national guardsmen
are expected in EH Paso today.
Andres Garcia, Mexican consul at
El Paso, said today:

war. from my interpretation of Presi
dent Wilson's last note. These seven-!
teen prisoners ought not offer an ob
stacle. The whole matter is up to

RUSSIAN DRIVE
Offensive Against Italians
Ends, Indicating That
Troops Are Moving
GERMANS GETTING
VERY NEAR VERDUN
Great French Fortress May
Yet Fall if the Teutons
Continue to Gain
London, June 26.—The Austrlans
have definitely abandoned their offen
sive in the southern Tyrol and are fall
ing back, according to today's reports
from the Italian front. Evidences of a
decided flagging lq the Austrian ag
gressive, which began to appear when
the Russian offensive in the east got
under headway, are now supplemented
by Rome's announcement that th3
Austrlans are retreating along a front
of some twenty miles in the Asiago
sector. The Italians are keeping up a
vigorous pursuit.
The Verdun battle, by all accounts
now in crucial stage, was continued
last night with new assaults by the
Germans west of the Tiaumont works,
north of the town. The French aTtil
lery and infantry fire, however, com
pletely stopped the Germans' attempt
to advance down the Froi de Terre
ridge, according to the Paris war of
fice.
The French' themselves claim to
have captured portions of trenches be
tween the Fumin-Chenois woods,
northeast of Ft. de Souvllle.
Probably preparatory to an effort to
bring their lines west of the Meuse
up to those on the east bank the Ger
mans are vigorously bombarding
French positions in the former sector.
The artill'ery fire is especially vigor
ous in the neighborhood of Dead Man
hill.
GERMANS NEAR VERDUN.
Paris, June 26. —The Germans are
now three-quarters of a mile from the
French lines immediately in front of
Verdun but no operation has as yet
been undertaken elsewhere to relievo
pressure on the citadel.
Last night's French official state
ment says no important event beyond
the usual canhonade occurred on the
western front.
FIGHTING IMPORTANT.
Berlin, June 26.—Fighting activity
in the western theater on the fronts
occupied by the British and north
wing of the French army was import
ant and has been so for the past two
days, says the official statement issued
today by the German army headquar
ters.
RUS8IAN8 TAKE TOWNS.
Petrograd, June 26.—Russian cav
alry after a battle with Austro-Hun
garian troops, has occupied a position
near Pezoritt, about five and one-half
miles west of Kimpolung,' in Buko
yina. This was announced in the
Russian official statement.
WAR SUMMARY,
The Russians have captured all of
Bukowina from the Austrlans who
are retreating toward the Carpathian
passes. Along the river Pruth the
Russians also inflicted heavy losses
upon the Austrlans in men taken pris
oner and in war stores left behind in
the retreat.
The Russians also report the repulse
of attacks southwest of Lutsk and an
advance north of Radziviloff, while
Berlin claims to have put down Rus
sian attacks east of Vladimir-Volhynia
and west of Dubno. Heavy fighting
continues throughout this region. The
greatest battle of the present series
on the Russian front appears to be de
veloping in the Lutsk region, accord
ing to Petrograd. The key to th3
whole situation is the Kovel junction
and tremendous efforts are being made
by the Germans to safeguard this vital
point.
The general opinion In Paris is that
the establishment of the Germans at
Fleury is "regrettable," owing to the
close proximity of that point to Ver
dun. Activity of the artillery is very
active between the British and Ger
mans on the Belgian front.
A general retreat of the Austriana
in the Trentino district over a distance
of twenty miles is reported officially,
by Rome. The Italians are in hot pur
suit.

AMERICAN LOSS IN
Orders Men To Leaver
That night, the party of four started
afoot in an attempt to get back to
the expeditionary command. Capt
Morey soon became so weak from loss
of blood that he was unable to walk
and believing he was dying, he ordered
his men to leave him and save them
selves. This they did'but shortly the
wounded ^officer managed to rally
enough "strength to crawl to the ranch
house of an American named McCabe,
about nine miles from Carrizal.
Maj. Jenkins reported he had found
Capt. Morey hidden in McCabe's house
and that his wounds were not danger
OUB. Upon the receipt of the dispatch,
Gen. Pershjng said, forty-three mem
bers of the command engaged had
been accounted for and that one other
is lost in the desert. The remainder
of the eight-four men who made up the
detachment are believed to have been
killed or made prisoners.

Chicago, June 26.—Theodore Roose
velt, in a letter read to the progres
sive national committee, in session
here today, finally declined to accept
the presidential nomination of the
party and strongly urged the bull
moose organization to support Charles
E. Hughes. The colonel's letter was
read by Oscar King Davis, secretary
of the committee.
The meeting of the national commit
tee was called to order by Matthew
Hale of Massachusetts, vice chairman,
in the absence of Victor Murdock of
Kansas, chairman of the committee.
The message from Col. Roosevelt

to the committee a telegram he had
received June 16 from Col. Roosevelt
and his reply in which the Louisiana
committeeman and the vice presiden
tial candidate of the party declared
that he would not support the candi
dacy of Hughes.
The telegram expressed the desire
of Col. Roosevelt to confer with Mr.
Parker over the political situation.
Mr. Parker, in reply, regretted that
it was impossible for him to visit Col.
Roosevelt and expressed his great re
gret at the retirement of Roosevelt
from politics.

ACCOUNTED FOR.
Field Headquarters, June 26. (By
wireless to Columbus, N. M., June 25)
—Twenty-three American soldiers are
known to have been killed in the Car
rizal battle, according to a report to
Gen. Pershing tonight from Maj. Jen
kins, commanding the eleventh caval
ry column ordered to scour the country
for survivors.
The report told of the rescue In
safety of Capt. Lewis 8. Morey, after
he had made a daring stand against
heavy Mexican odds and heoric per
sonal sacrifices In an effort to save the
lives of his men. Maj. Jenkins said he
had evidence that nine American
troopers, in addition to those previous
ly reported dead, had been killed.
A note found on the body of Capt. T.
Boyd, the American commander, who
lost his life, proved that Gen. Felix
Gomez, the Mexican commander, in
vited him Into the town of Carrizal and
that he had refused and afterward con
ferred with Gomez outside the town.
Neither the notebook of Capt. Boyd
nor that of Capt. Morey, both of which
were recovered, threw any new light
on the clash.
After the first firing troop, under
Capt. Morey's command, took refuge
In a nearby adobe, but, Maj. Jenkins
reported, realizing their predicament,
he ordered his men to leave the hut
in small detachments.
Capt. Morey, himself suffering with
slight woundB, with four men, remain
ed hidden throughout the day in the
lMHisto, which was within 2,000 yards of
the Carranzista line.

Commercial Club Discusses
Project at Luncheon to
Bear Ottumwa Pennants
The Commercial club directors
this morning Instructed the secre
tary to send a telegram to Con
gressman Rameeyer and the two
United 8tates senator* from Iowa
asking them to use their best ef
forts to have restored the previ
sion for the dependents of militia
men that was stricken frbm the
house military bill Saturday In
the senate.
A movement has been started
among Ottumwans that contemplates
a large number autos filled with citi
zens, many of them relatives of the
members of Company G, to viBit the
guardsmen at Camp Dodge next Sun
day. The project was taken up at the
luncheon of the Commercial club direc
tors this -noon TO' which Dr. W. E.
Creath was a guest and submitted the
proposition for a big Ottumwa delega
tion to call upon the boys.
The movement was started when
some of the friends of the company
members told Capt. Schamp that they
might be up to Des Moines in cars to
see the boys before they left for the
front. The captain told them to come
as anyone from Ottumwa would be
very welcome in the company quarters
at Camp Dodge.
Once the project was newsed about
many OttumwanB owning cars fell In
with the idea and the plan was launch
ed to have as many car owners as pos
sible make a place for members of the
guardsmen's families in order that
they might see'their boys again before
going south.
The plan as discussed before the
luncheon contemplated no general
leaving time for the party owing to
some cars running faster than others
and the fear that .the parade idea
could not be carried out successfully
if they left here together. It was
thought best for all to leave when they
pleased but to gather at the state fair
grounds after arriving in Des Moines
and at an appointed time, perhaps
10:30 Sunday morning, to start as a
big procession from the meeting point,
run through DeB Moines and out to
Camp Dodge. The cars are to be dec
orated in a uniform manner and all
bear Ottumwa pennants.
The directors, upon motion of Sena
tor Whitmore, appointed a committee
of three headed by Dr. Creath to take
charge of the plans for the auto trip.
Every car owner in Ottumwa will be
asked to tell the committee whether
they have a car available and what
room can be given to accommodate
members of the guardsmen's families.
Some forty owners have already ex
pressed their Intention to go.
Organize Relief Plan.
The proposition to start a relief
movement in Ottumwa that will pro
vide for the dependents of guardsmen
called to service was discussed and
an organization formed. A motion to
have the chairman of the meeting ap
point a committee of three, which in
turn shall select a committee of five
with members of both sexes, carried
and W. T. Harper, Wallace Graham
and W. R. Daum were named as the
first committee.
All present at the meeting were
urged to attend the big picnic of the
acre corn and baby pork clubs of the
county that is to be held Tuesday in
Wildwood. The weekly meeting was
held today instead of Tuesday because
of the picnic.
REMOVES MAN WHO
FAILED TO ATTACK
Ricaut. commander of the northeast
ern Mexican border patrol, and rein
stated Gen. Emiliano Nafarrate, now
at Tampico. The change was said to
have been due to Ricaut's failure to
attack the American forces that cross

June 17.

RU8HING MEDICAL TE8T8.
Des Moines, June 26.—Col. Morgan,
U. S. A., chief mustering officer of the
Iowa national guard, today ordered
guard commanders to rush through the
work of iqustering their men so as to
be ready for border service immediate
ly. Col. Morgan Bald that if possible,
the first infantry regiment of the Iowa
guard will leave Camp Dodge tomor
row morning.
"Medical officers are examining men
E^t an average of one man a minute,"
he said. "We have a dozen officers
working and I see no reason why the
first regiment should not entrain for
the border at once."
Col. Morgan said that he had not
been advised by the war department
where the rtoops would be sent but
said he thought El Paso would be the
place.
More than a score of men of the
first regiment today refused to take
the oath and were mustered out of
service. Co. of Keokuk, because
thfeir captain was changed and a new
commander substituted, refused to go
and was ordered returned to its home
station. Later, however, Gen. Morgan,
consented to allow the men to reenliat
in other companies if they so desired.
