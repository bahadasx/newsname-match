Washington.?Effort* toward LatlnAmerfnan
mediation in the Mexican
crisis favored by Carransa officials
collapsed without having reached the
stage of a formal proposal to the United
States.
It was mads plain by Secretary
Lansing to Ignaclo Calderon, Minister
(of Boliva, who called with the intention
of asking whether the United
States would entertain an offer of the
services of its'southern neighbors to
aid in averting war, that the Washington
government sees nothing in
the situatalon that would warrant ar.
Mtratlon proceedings. Mr. Lansing
talked with the minister for half an
hour and is understood to have told
him that the blame for the grave outlook
rented squarely upon General
Carrauz^. The attitude of the United
States was so fully outlined that Mr.
Calderon did not mention directly the
original purpose of his visit.
When the Minister left the state
department he said the time "'seemed
Inopportune" and that for tho present
the diplomatic representatives of six
South and Central American coi*ptries
who had approached the Mexican
Embassy on the subject of mediation
and received assurances that the Carranza
Goverument was favorable1 to
the principle would not tender their
good olees to the United States. He
indicated that tho attempt to arrange
mediation might be renewed if General
Carranza's reply to Secretary
Lansing'B Is at not* furnished any basis
on which the proposal could be
founded.
The United States now Is waiting
tor Carranza's flnal word in reply to
uitj note aem&naing release of the
prisoners taken In Carrlzal and a formal
diplomatic announcement of intentions.
Special Agent Rodgers reported
receipt of the note adding
that he had failed in his drat efforts
to place it in the hauds of the Carransa
Minister of Foreign Relations.
Meanwhile both Congress and the
War Department put new urgency
into their preparations for war. There
were indications that should a formal
break occur during the week, Qeneral
Funs ton will be in a position to defend
the border adequately and reinforce
Qen. Pershing's expedition, although
aggressive action may be delayed
somewhat
War Department activities during
the day covered a wide field. Supplemental
orders to departmental
oommanders called for greater haste
la getting the National Guard to the
border. Authorisation went out to
accept the men under the physical
examinations on which they entered
the state service, postponing final examination
until they are en route or
have reached the border. Those found
unfit will be sent back at once.
Estimates to cover the pay and
maintenance expense of the state
troops, totalling 188,000,000 up to
January 1, were laid before Congress.
With them went figures of 813.000,000
J * for the purchase of horses and mules
for army use. The total estimates
of the Quartermaster General alone
paas the $100,000,000 mark.
The House passed the annual army
appropriation bill after adding $26,000,000
for emergency purposes during
the brief debate that preceded the
vote. An argent deficiency bill carvying
$25,000,000 for National Guard
pay. equipment and transportation
was framed In committee for presentation
to the House.
