Believes Country Would Ap
prove Avoiding Clash.
BY ROBERT J. BENDER
Washington. June 27. Cabinet of
ficers, before going into session today
with President Wilson, were determ
ined that Carranza must make quick
answer to American demands. A
limit in days or hours was not set. but
members felt Carranza should not be
permitted more than two days pro
vided the United States note was deliv
ered him yesterday as anticipated.
The first chiefs attitude could only
be conjectured. The guesses ff official
quarters were that he would be none
too conciliatory and that he might
force trouble.
At any rate, cabinet men said, his
answer is the determining element in
the situation rather than the indica
tion that perhaps American forces
were partly provocative of the Carri
zal battle.
Must Release Prisoners.
Carranza's refusal to release the
American prisoners in Chihuahua City
or an unfriendly statement of attitude
toward future relations with this
country doubtless would cause imme
diate visitation of the "gravest con
sequences" with which President Wil
son threatened him.
On the other hand, compliance with
the request with a favorable intent to
ward this government be proved
would smooth out a troublesome sit
uation. Secretary of War Baker reported
his supplemental order cutting red
tnpc ujid permitting national guards
mei. to move more rapidly toward the
hder. His document showed mo
bi'ization and troop movements satis
factory. Lansing's report on rejec
tion of the Bolivian mediation offer
was j-.pproved with the added decision
tlii-.t the Mexican problem for iho
preson' at least is beyond the msd.a
tk.n t,ti:ge.
l!us Support of Xntion.
I- esident Wilson is anxious to avoid
Trouble with the de facto government
if 1 e can do so honorably. In this
ieelir.r-, he has the support of the na
t:n. administration officials sai.i to-
d ''in other difficulties ther. has bsen
a ir-at national upheaval for war,"
said an army nvin today. "In this

the president can avoid a war he
would have the countrys' approval."

Sacramento. Oal.. Jure 27. In an
nouncing today that h will support
Charles Evans Hushes for the preei
rtercy. Governor Johnson issued a
statement in which he declared thai
his action does not mean that "we in
California abandon Progress! vim.'
In his statement, addressed to "the
Progressives of the state of Califor
nia,' he says in part:
"Apparently it seems that the Pro
gressive party cannot proceed this
year as a separate national political
party and that Progressives in the
ensuing presidential election must
choose between Mr- Wilson and Mr.
Hughes. Inasmuch as this is so, oi.d
because I believe our sole accomplish
ment at Chicago was to compel his
nomination by the Republicans and
because I believe his record warrants
it. I make my individual choice and
shall support Mr. Hughes. That we
are con fronted with this alternative
does not mean that we in California
abandon Progressivism. The Pro
gressive movement is permanent."

TO PROVOKE WAR

Hostilities Appear Inevitable,
Mexican Minister Declares.
Washington, June 27. Mediation of
the dispute with Mexico was a dead
issue today and national guardsmen
were ready to start for the border to
enforce the United States demands on
General Carranza's government. Sec
retary Lansing yt-v.-rday prevented
even formal proposal of mediation by
telling Minister Calderon of Bolivia
that the American government be
lieves nothing in the situation is sub
ject to arbitration. General Carranza
previously had accepted -'in princi
ple" the offer to mediate.
With a singleness of purpose, ad
ministration officials were looking to
day for word from Mexico City, indi
cating General Carranza's future in
tentions toward the United States.
This was expected in reply to the last
American note demanding release of
the prisoners held at Chihuahua City.
Even greater efforts were made by
the war department to eliminate red
tape and expedite the dispatch of na
tional guardsmen to relieve regular
army border patrons for a possible
Mexican campaign.

ing the developments of the crisis be
tween the United States and Mexico
received a new impetus today follow
ing a spirited discussion in the cham
ber of deputies during which an op
position deputy made a bitter attack
on the United States. The discussion
was opened by this deputy, who com
menting on the last note sent to Mex
ico by Secretary Lansing declared he
was astonished that the United States
should make difficulties in accepting
the explanations of Mexico while
promptly accepting those of Germany
in regard to the submarine war. The
speaker asserted that Germany was
continuing its undersea campaign in
violation of its promise to Washington
and that the United States did not
dare to protest. He concluded by ex
pressing the hope that Brazil would
continue to defend the principle of the
sovereignty of all countries.
Deputy Souza E. Silva. speaking for
the government, defended the interna
tional policy of the administration and
declared that Brazil stood firmly for
the solidarity and fraternity of the
American nations. Deputy Souza also
denied reports that the voyage of Dr.
Lauro Muller, minister of foreign af
fairs to the United States had to do
with the Mexican situation.

Washington, June 27. Fifteen hun

Plan to Build After Heim Re
fuses South Side Route.
On the heels of rumors the Heim
interests have decided to build their
interurban line into Topeka on the
nortn side or the Kaw river, from
Lawrence, come reports that the To
peka Railway company will enter the
interurban field in this territory and
build into Lawrence through territory
south of the Kaw. These reports were
given considerable impetus this morn
ing when it was announced directors
of the company in a meeting held
Monday afternoon voted to increase
the authorized capital stock of the
company from Jl, 210,000 to $2,250,
000.. While officials of the company re
fuse to confirm the report that the
line will be built from Topeka to Law
rence, they officially admit the in
creased stock will be used for im
provements and extension of lines.
The application for increase in capi
talization probably will be made to the
state charter board this afternoon.
That the construction of a line be
tween Lawrence and Topeka through
Deej creek valley has long been urged
by lecal merchants and that they have
piomised every possible means ot as
sistance in making a road through
the territory a paying proposition is
well krown here.
Until reports the Heim Una had
decided to build north of the river
reached Topeka less than two weeks
ago, local merchants understood that
the Heim interurban which already
operates between Kansas City and
Lawrence would reach Topeka over
the southern route. Following- unof
ficial announcement the Heims had
abandoned the idea of building south
of the Kaw. local merchants attempt
ed to obtain a conference with offi
cials of the company with a view of
uiging the route south of the r:-er.
While no line now penetrates the
territory through Deer Creek valley,
the country is rich and can support an
electric railway, local merchants de
! Clare. In the event the Topeka rail
j way builds the line to Lawrence the
I Vinewood park tracks, abandoned
I some time ago. will be used as far as
i they extend.
I In addition to authorizing the in
I creased capital stock election of offi-
Icers was held.
These officers were elected: W. B.
