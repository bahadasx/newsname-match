A special election will be held in

few days to draw up the proposed
amendment.
Engineers at Work.
A. P. White, president of the char

that work had been started yester

time to take steps to have a survey
made of the Diamond Point city park

was made at this time the cost would'
be very reasonable. No detail plan
will be made at this time.

gestion and took steps to have the
state engineers make a survey of the
city park immediately.
City Attorney Russell read to the
council a provision in the state laws
for the purchasing and improving of

a city park.
President White of the charter
commission stated that the commis
sion would take action immediately.
Five commissioners will probably
be named as a park board. The
board will have power to levy assess
ments for park improvements.

of Block 20 if it agreeable to the Be
midji Townsite & Improvement com

block is in front of the Union depot.
