fly Associated Press
Washington, D. C., June 27. —There
were clear indications to-day that if
American cavalrymen cantured by
Mexican troops at Carrizal were not
released within 48 hours, action
would be taken by the United States.
The impression prevailed in official
circles that President Wilson would
not wait beyond Thursday at the latest
and possibly not beyond to-morrow
afternoon for a definite reply from the
Carranza government to the note de
manding the immediate release of the
prisoners and a declaration of inten
tions.
Special Agent Kodgers at Mexico
City reported in an overnight mes
sage received early to-day that he had
delivered the note to the Mexican
foreign office yesterday morning. He
did not Indicate how it had been re
ceived or when a reply is expected.
Hasten Mobilization
While the diplomatic aspects of the
crisis awaited Carranza's action, the
War Department drove forward its
efforts to hasten mobilization of the
National Guard on the border. It is
certain that no aggressive military op
erations can be undertaken until a
substantial number of State troops is
available to back up General Funston's
regulars who unquestionably would
lead any movement.
President Wilson's first step, should
he decide to force the issue, probably
would be to lay the whole situation
before Congress in joint session. It is
believed he so informed members of
the foreign committees of both
Houses in his conference with them
Sunday night.
Authority Needed
Specific authority under which the
National Guard could be employed
beyond the border and also authori
zation for calling out volunteers would
be needed.
It is regarded as certain also that
any resolution presented for action
would include a reaffirmation of the
position of the administration that it
is being forced into military action for
the defense of its town territory from
outlaws, and has no purpose of terri
torial aggrandizement.
Mexican officials here have ex
pressed the opinion that General Car
ranza would surrender the American
prisoners, whatever reply he might
make to the demand for a formal dip
lomatic expression of his purposes.
Army in Good Shape
Every day's delay in what seems the
inevitable break in relations with the
Mexican government sees the army
in better position for the swift action
that may follow. This has influenced
against pressing matters to an imme
diate issue. Had the border forces
been sufficient to release the regulars

By Associated Press
Camp Brumbaugh, Mt. Gretna. Pa.,
June 27.—The departure of the First
Brigade for the border, officially or
dered for to-day. will In all probabil
ity be postponed until to-morrow
morning or later.
Orders from Washington, demand
ing that a complete muster roll of
the division be submitted to army
headquarters is responsible for the
expected delay. The orders require
complete identification descriptions of
every soldier, similar to that of the
regular amry. The taking of finger
prints alone will lie dispensed with.
Although the original orders to
move to-nisht have not been ret ailed,
hope of fulfilling them under the
the commanding officers see little
hope of fulfilling them under the con
ditions which demand so detailed a
statistical report on every soldier. The
disappointment of both enlisted men
and officers is keen.
Governor Goes Over Camp
Governor Brumbaugh motored to
the camp immediately after the order
had been received and engaged in a
lengthy discussion Major-General
element, the division commander. At
its conclusion, the Governor ex
pressed himself as frankly dubious of
the departure of the brigade until to
morrow.
With his secretary r-vl members of
the Major-General's stufr, the Gover
nor made an unofficial inpsection of
the encampment expressing himself as
delighted with the progress shown,
and the spirit of the men who have
hastened to the mobilization in time
of their nation's need. With the de
mand for muster rolls, United States
, army headquarters sent an official or
der for the immediate discharge of
all the colored cooks. It will go Into
effect at once. Under army regula
tions, which now control what was the
National Guard of Pennsylvania, white
and colored soldiers may not be en
listed in the same regimetn.
The First Brigade, already short on
I rations faces the possibility of being
j without cooks until the recruiting of
ficers in Philadelphia, acting under
prompt messages from headquarters
here, enlist and hasten white cooks to
: their quarters.
The tentative schedule is that the
Second Brigade, the next in seniority
|of its command to the First. may
move on Thursday and be followed by
i the Fourth on Saturday with the
cavalry and artillery going out on
Monday, hut this may be changed.
Arrival of recruits kept the camps
lively during the morning as men of
: regiments paraded to the station to
welcome the parties. In the regimen
tal camps medical examinations, vac
i cination and everlasting drills were
the order of the day, the monotony
Icing varied by practice by the
bands.
Colored Cooks Discharged
Orders were issued from head
quarters to-day discharging all cdlored
cooks and some vigorous scurrying
about to get men in their places re
sulted. In the First Brigade, which is
to go out within 2 4 hours the order
caused considerable stir.
Even if the First Brigade is delayed
'in going away from here, it is the
opinion lhat the Second Brigade will
'be abl<2 to start on Thursday, if a
{movement that day is approved by the
Department of the East. The men of
the Second have kept wires hot to get
j eurly orders to move.
The news that New Jersey regi
intents had been passing through
; Pennsylvania to-day on their way to
' the southwest was received with
1 liters for the lucky Jerseymen at sev
eral camps.
Major-General Dougherty in Camp
Major-General C. B. Dougherty
| "ho commanded the National Guard
j for five years, arrived during the
| morning and made a visit of inspec
tion of the camp after calling upon
Major-General Clement, commander
ot the division. General Dougherty
commanded the Ninth regiment dur
ing the Spanish war.
Get Ammunition
Thirteen trains on the railroad
sidings ready to carry the First Bri
gade and auxiliary organizations. Five
j days' rations and 200 rounds of am
{ munition were issued for each of the
3,200 men comprising the brigade last
I night.
I The two companies of engineers
I which were the first to establish the
mobilization camp here, were also the
first to strike tents when the order to

Latest Advices Lend Color to
Prevalent Belief That Con

RUSSIANS PUSHING AHEAD
Sweeping Toward Kolomea;
Turks Claim to Be Holding
Them; U-Boats Active
By Associated Press
To-day's dispatches give little Indi
cation of the general course of events
within the past few hours along the
Franco-Belgian front where the Brit
ish artillery has been notably active
for two or three days. The latest re
ports from both Berlin and London,
j however, lend color to the somewhat
prevalent belief that the long threat
ened concerted attack by the entente
allies on the various fronts is in pre
paration, if not in actual process of
s execution.
At Verdun the situation has not
materially changed over night. Paris
reports further progress for the
French tn regaining ground in the re
gion of the Thiaumont work, north of
the citadel. Rather spirited fighting
also has been in progress in the re
gion of Floury, with no alterations in
position.
Operations by Teutonic submarines
are being continued in the Mediterran
ean where the British steamer Cardiff
and the French steamer Fournel have
been sunk.
Turks Hold Russians
Constantinople reports successes in
Turkish Armenia where the Russians
in some sectors north of the river
Tchoruk are said to be retreating to
-1 ward the Black Sea coast after a de
feat at the hands of the Turks.
In the east the Russians, while still
held up in their advance on Kovel by
the Germans, arc continuing their ad
vance against the Austrians in the
south. Their flank now protected by
the Carpathians, they have turned
noithward in their sweep through Bu
kowlna and are now approaching Kol
| omea. They are already within ten
1 miles of the town.
Strategy of the Allies
The allies' plan, as It is understood
by military men, is not for any com
bined assault on all forts at once. In
stead they are perfectly content to al
