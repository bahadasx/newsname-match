Every Day's Delay Renders It
Cope With the Mexican
OILY HB OF THE Hi LACK OF FBEFIBESS OF IHE UML GOAHD
PRUED WON FROM PBESSitlG MATTERS TO IMMEDIATE COHCLOSION
Washington, June 27.; It is clear
from indications today that unless the
American cavalrymen captured at
Carrizal are released within forty
eight hours action will be taken by
the United States. The impression
prevailed in official circles that Pres
ident Wilson wouldn't wait beyond
Thursday, possibly not beyond tomor
row afternoon, for a definite reply
from Carranza to the note demanding
the immediate release of the Ameri
cans taken prisoner at Carrizal and a
declaration of Mexican intentions.
Special Agent Rodgers, at Mexico
City, reported that he delivered the
note to the Mexican foreign office yes
terday morning. He didn't indicate
how it was received or when a reply
is expected. ,
AGGRESSIVE ACTION CANT BE
TAKEN
It is certain that no aggressive mil
itary operations can be undertaken
ur. til there is a substantial number of
national guardsmen to back up Gen.
Funston's regulars. President Wil
son's first step, should he decide to
force the issue, probably would be to
lay the situation before Congress and
ask for specific authority to use the
v militia' beyond the border and the au
thorization of calling for volunteers
should they be needed.
It is regarded as certain that any
resolution offered would reaffirm the
administration's position that it is
being forced to defend United States
territory and not to seize territory.
Mexican officials here expressed
the opinion that Carranza would yield
the prisoners. The state department'
has nothing confirmatory to this.
.'- EVERY DAY A GAIN
Every delay in the seemingly inevi
table break seems the United States
army better prepared for swift' ac
tion. This and the problem of get
ting Americans out of Mexico in
fluenced government officials against
pressing matters.
Had the border forces been suffi
cient it is more than probable a time
limit would have been included in Sec
retary Lansing's note. There are
about a thousand Americans still in
Mexico and many intend to stay. .
SAND-ASPHALT STANDS
Even the Weight of a Heavy Traction
Engine on a Hot Day Made No
Dent on Its Smooth Surface
There has been some discussion as
to whether or not the sand-asphalt
paving, which has been suggested for
the proposed permanent roads for
Marion county, would stand up under
the heavy traffic of a log wagon. The
following from the Eustis Lake Re
gion wil be interesting, therefore:;
"A four-ton Sandusky traction
engine belongine to Hale & Houston.
cf Eustis recently ran over the as
phalt road from the Tavares-Mt.
Dora junction to the Eustis city lim
its without making an impression on
the asphalt surface, despite the fact
that it was high noon, sun bright, and
the tractor had inch flanges on both
front wheels."
Geo. M. Starke, the colored man re
ferred to in yesterday's Star as be
ing the subject of a difficult and dan
gerous operation, died thi3 morning,
and his remains were sent to his
home at South Lake Weir for burial.
George was very highly respected by
jail who knew him, both white and col-
red. For the last fifteen years he
lad been in charge of one of the big
i South Lake Werr groves, the owner
it which implicitly trusted him. He
leaves a wife and several children.
The people who knew this worthy
olored man best speak of him as "one
f Nature's noblemen." -

fused by the Courts ;
Tallahassee, June 27. Comptroller
W. V.' Knott, apparently defeated for
governor, in the primary of June 6 by
Sidney J. Catts, and now preparing to
contest the count of votes as im
properly conducted in certain in
stances, won the first skirmish before
the state canvassing board yesterday
morning when he asked i that begin
ning of the canvass be delayed until
3 o'clock when he would have a writ
ten statement to submit. The board
granted the request, which was made
by Mr. Knott, in person, his attorney
not being present. Atorney Flournoy
for Mr. Catts "cross-questioned " the
comptroller as to what the nature of
the statement would be, but Knott
would not answer, merely saying that
his case was before the board. He
said he wanted Mr. lournoy and every
citizen of the state to understand
that he wanted nothing but what was
due him and that he would heartily
support the nominee of the party and
help make the administration a suc
cess. Made One Himself
Attorney Flournoy replied that the
time for making political . speeches
had passed and asked that the board
proceed with the canvass. The vote
was then taken and it was 3 to 2 for
delay.
Treasurer Luning took ' Comptrol
ler Knott's place on the board on ac
count of Knott being a candidate.
Commissioner of Agriculture McRae

ill? MELONS -TFT
Acreage in Marion County Consider
ably Less than Last Year, but
Pricesare Satisfactory
From information obtained there
appears to be a good acreage of wa
termelons in this section yet to be
shipped. This is said to be especially
true of the northern part of the coun
ty. Mr. J. M. Meffert, at Lowell, for
example, ha some fine melons com
ing on, his crop having been consid
erably damaged and set back by the
heavy hail storm in that section this
spring.
". The acreage of melons this year,
according to some figures, was over
G.000 acres short. Prices are said to
have been generally satisfactory;
however, and there has probably been
considerable money made by the
growers.
While the yields of the cantaloupe
fields are said to have been especially
good, the acreage has been much less
than last season. The first few cars
brought good prices, and then there
was a slump. Probably not more
than 50 cars of cantaloupes have been
shipped out of the state.
MAMMOTH WATERMELON

had not known but what it was all a
