The
ULTIMATUM
TO MEXICANS
Uncle Sam Demands Formal State
ment from Carranza and
lease of Prisoners.
Re-
Latest From Mexico.
Efforts toward LatinAmerican me
idiation in the Mexican crisis, favor
'ed by Carranza officials, collapsed
Monday without having reached the
stage of a formal proposal to the
United States now in waiting for
Carranza's final word in reply to the
note sent Sunday demanding the re
lease of prisoners taken at Carrizal
and a formal diplomatic announce
ment of intentions.
Tle War Department put new urg
ency into preparations for war.
There were indications that should a
formal break occur toward the end
of the week every possible precau
tionary step will have been taken and
Gen. Funston will be in a position to
defend the border adequately and re
enforce Pershing's expedition, al
though aggressive action may be de
layed somewhat.
Congress made sweeping increases
Monday in the interest of prepared
ness. The Senate passed the resolu
tion authorizing the President to
draft the National Guard, eliminated
provision for $1,000,000 for relief of
dependent families of guardsmen in
the Hay resolution; the House added
$26,610,000 to the Army Appropria
tion Bill to meet emergencies in
Mexico; a subcommittee of the Sen
ate reported the Naval Bill, adding
four dreadnoughts, increasing the
number of destroyers from ten to
twenty and providing for completion
of a building program of three years
instead of five. Increases for arse
nals and ammunition were general.
Hurried preparations for the re
ception of thousands of National
Guardsmen are under way in JM .ra
so, Texas.
Orders for the field hospital, am
bulance corps and three or four
companies of the First Regiment to
entrain for Ft. Thomas probably will
be issued Tuesday. Kentucky Na
tional Guards will be hurried to the
mobilization camp as fast as the
gounds can be prepared to receive
the men, Adjt. Gen. Ellis announced:
Recruiting is especially active in the
mountain section of the state.
A curt note from the Washington
Government demanding the immed
. iate release of United JStatesJxoopers
captured at Carrizal, and an immedi
ate statement from Gen. Carranza
"through the proper diplomatic chan
nels, and not through subordinate
military officers," as to the purposes
of the Mexican Government was dis
patched Sunday by Secretary Lan
sing for delivery to Gen. Carranza.
The note says that an explanation of
the Carrizal encounter received from
the Mexican authorities is regarded
as an avowal of the affair in Wash
ington. The intimation that force
will be met with force stands out in
the brief diplomatic document.
Captain Lewis Sidney Morey, be
lieved to be dying from loss of blood
and lack of water, crouched in a hole
where he had sought a hiding place
after his troopers had been over
whelmed and scattered by the over
,. whelming numbers of the Mexicans
at Carrizal, wrote with soldierly
punctiliousness a simple, brief report
of the hgnt to nis commanding om
cer. When night fell these troopers,
who had taken refuge in the same
hiding place, carried the desperately
wounded officer two miles. Then,
thinking that he was dying, Morey
commanded the trooper to leave him
and to carry on his message.
Lieutenant Meyers, of the Tenth
Cavalry, scouting in search of sur
vivors of the fight, came upon these
three negro troopers Sunday. Capt.
Morey and two of his men afterward
reached the main body of troops.
An uncertain quantity is intro
duced into the international problem
of the fight at Carrizal by Morey's
Statement that the Americans advan
ced toward the Mexican position be
fore the Mexicans opened fire.
American negro troopers faced al
most certain death at Carrizal with
smiles on their lips, and they burst
into song once or twice as they
fought their grim fight against odds.
This was the story told by Capt. Mo
rey when he arrived at field head
quarters Monday.
"For 45 minutes the men fought,
joking amoug themselves all the
while, even tho they realized we had
been trapped and had little chance
of getting out alive," he said.
Capt. Morey said he had never
seen such valor as was displayed by
Capt. Charles T. Boyd in leading a
handful of dismounted skirmishers
thru the machine-gun fire and into
the ambush of death. He added
that it was not until their ammuni
tion was exhausted that the troop
was finally cut to pieces and told of
the heroic death of Lieut. Henry R.
Adair of Portland, Ore., in an at
tempt to replenish it.
Lieut. Adair died fighting, his last
words being: "Go on, Sergeant," to
a non-commissioned officer at his
side, Capt. Morey said. The two were
on their way to the pack animals car
rying the ammunition when they
were intercepted near asmall irriga
tion ditch by a detail of the Mexi
cans. Lieut. Adah nad already been
wounded and had lost his pistol in
the previous fighting, but he had bor
rowed another and was fighting a
hand to hand battle when he was
killed.
He fell unconscious and was
caught by the negro sergeant as he
slid toward the ditch
which was
deeply filled with water. The ser
geant held Adair in his arms, his
face above the water until he died,
the wounded officer reviving only
long enough to whisper orders to
leave him and finish the mission.
Capt. Morey said that Capt. Boyd
warned the men before the fight that
they were advancing into the great
est danger. He reiterated that the
Carranza soldiers opened fire first
from their machine-gun trench and
asserted that almost immediately af
terward a detachment of the Mexi
cans circled to th'e rear and drove
off numbers of the American horses,
which a few men had been left to
hold while the cavalry men dismount
ed in line of skirmish.
Capt. Morey was brought in by
troops of the Eleventh Cavalry sent
to rescue Carrizal survivors after
having led a handful of starving,
panting troopers forty miles over a
sunbaked desert to relief.
Made a Brave Fight.
The force of the Tenth United
States cavalry, under Captain Char
les T. Boyd, succeeded in breaking
thru the line of the Mexican force
under General Felix Gomez at Carri
zal, according to a message from
General Persing to General Funston.
Captain Boyd's men of troop C.
took the ditch in which the front line
of Mexican troops were intienched
and charged thru into the town of
Carrizal. Troop L, under Capt. Lewis
Morey, charged with C. Troop, but
were outflanked and forced to take
refuge in an adobe house. They at
least had a chance to defend them
selves from cover.
This news came to General Persh
ing by courier from Major John M.
Jenkins, commanding a squadron of
the relief expedition out from Colon
ia Dublan. Major Jenkins also an
nounced that he had found five
members of C. Troop of the Tenth
cavalry and one member of the H
Troop at San Luis ranch. They also
were horseholders, as were the other
stragglers who have reported.
General Pershing reported that
the troops under Capt. Boyd and
Capt. showed the greatest courage
and exhibited the most sterling
fighting qualities.
No mention of the Mexican caval
ry charge reported by the stragglers
was made in the Pershing report,
but the fact that the Americans were
able to advance and break thru the
Mexican line after the first attack is
beieved to give some indication that
the charge was checked.
According to stories told by the
five men found at San Luis ranch,
after the Mexicans had opened fire,
with several machine guns, Captain
Boyd dismounted and formed his
men in line of skirmishes. Capt. Boyd
with C Troop, led the first line and
Captain Morey with-K Trpop ihe
right. They advanced by rushes to
ward the ditch 250 yards distant
which sheltered the main force of
the Mexicans and from which the
machine guns were spraying their
ranks with lead.
Making every shot of their own
count, they captured it with one final
wild rush, putting the Mexicans to
flight and capturing several machine
guns.
In the final rush on the entrenched
Mexicans, Captain Boyd fell dead,
shot thru the body. Without check
ing their advance C Troop, led by
Lieutenant Adair, dashed on after
the fleeing Mexicans into the town.
That was the last seen of them by
the men found at San Lnis ranch.
Apparently they found themselves in
danger of capture from Mexicans ap
proaching from the rear and Gener
al Pershing's report gives no further
details of the state of Adair and his
men.
Captain Morey was shot thru the
shoulder while advancing with K
troop on the irragation ditch. His
men, however, were outflanked by a
superior force of Mexicans and were
forced to take shelter in an abode
nouse. When at last seen by the
stragglers they were returning a
spirited fire, thru windows and loop
holes punched in the abode walls, to
the Mexicans surrounding their shel
ter. UNEASY ON ARIZONA BORDER.
L. B. Hilton, agent at Rowland,
received a letter from his brother-in-law,
F. W. Hannah, of Nogales, Ari
zona, early this week, in which Mr.
Hannah vividly describes conditions
on the Mexican border. He says
that the people on the American side
are in anticipation of an attack from
the Mexicans, and all the civilians
have armed themselves and are con
stantly on guard. He says the Mex
icans have brought up a vastly su
perior force on their side of the bor
der; have a large quantity of artil
lery, and will play havoc with the
small American force, at Nogales un
less the latter are reinforced. He
reports however, that two special
trains are on their way to Nogales
with more soldiers. It is for this bor
der guarding duty that the state mi
litiamen will be used.
MADE FORTUNE IN WEST.
Col. Andrew Livingston, who went
to Montana about 40 years ago from
this section of Kentucky, has been
here for several days the -guest of
Josh B. Jones and family on the
Knob Lick pike. Col. Livingston has
had a great success in(raising cattle
and sheep on his western ranches. He
has never forgotten his old Kentucky
Home, however and always enjoys a
visit here.
Restored to Good Health
"I was sick for four years with
stomach trouble," writes Mrs. Otto
Gans, Zanesville, Ohio. "I lost weight
and felt so weak -that I almost gave
up hope of being cured. A friend
told me about Chamberlain's Tablets,
and since using two bottles of them
I have been a well woman." Obtain-

NOBLE WOMAN
IS NO MORE
Mrs. Mattie VanDeveer Kirby
Dies
Tuesday Morning After Short
Illness Funeral Thursday.
Mrs. Mattie VanDeveer Kirby died
at 6 o'clock this, Tuesday morning,
after an illness of a week. She had
been in very feeble health for some
time, the result of a severe spell of
grip, and contracted a cold which
went into pneumonia. This did its
deadly work in a hurry and took
from the scenes of earth one of Stan
ford's most excellent women.
Mrs. Kirby was born in 1869. and
most all of her life had been spent
in Stanford, where everybody knew
and loved her. She was the second
daughter of the late D. W. Vande
veer, for years a merchant of this
city and its mayor for several terms.
Her mother was Miss Mattie Luns-
ford, also long since gone to rest.
She is survived by one sister Mrs. W.
E. Varnon, of Asheville, N. C. who
was with her when the final summons
came. When her last illness began,
she asked that she be taken to Dr.
Brown's home on the hill, where she
thought she would find quietude, the
noise of the street annoying her. It
is not believed that she thought her
mness serious, ior nau sne. sne
would have remained in the room of
the house she had so frequently said
she wanted to die in. But man pro
poses and God in His inscrutable wis
dom disposes and the end came-in
Dr. E. J. Brown's home.
Ever since Mrs Kirby was a child,
she had been a Christian and a de
vout member of the Christian church
and she attended the services of the
Stanford church just as long as her
health would permit. She took much
interest in church wo"rk and often
did more than her feeble body well
withstood. She will be missed in her
church work, in her home, as a neigh
bor and as a friend and the news of
her death will carry sorrow to all who
knew her. Mrs. Permelia Brown, who
lived a neighbor to Mrs. Kirby for 35
years, said to an I. J. repreesntative
this morning: "I have lost my best
friend. Mattie Kirby was high-toned
and honorable, she was just, true and
good and I will miss her probably
more than anybody. Only a few
weeks ago she said to me: 'I will die
before you do, but I know I am go-
ing to meet you later and that will
be glory for me.' She bore her pains
and troubles with wonderful forti
tude and was at all times cheerful
and bright. It saddens my heart to
think I will never see her no more
until our meeting beyond the skies,"
she continued.
Mrs. Kirby was devoted to both of
her sister's children, Thomas and
Miss Martha Varnon, but more so to
the latter and to her she left all of
her worldly possessions. Miss Var
non visited her aunt here last year.
The two were inseparable and their
devotion was beautiful to behold.
The funeral services Avill be held
at the home on East Main street at
10 a. m., Thursday conducted by
Dr. D. M. Walker and assisted bv
Eld. Joseph Ballou. The burial will
follow in the Buffalo Cemetery.
TWO CASEYITES PARDONED
Gov. Stanley last week pardoned
Sam Lee, of Clinton county, who
has served five years of a life sen
tence for the death of D. C. Moles,
who was shot to death dn the public
road. The evidence on which he was
convicted was purely circumstantial,
and a man accused of complicity was
acquitted. The trial Judge and
others petitioned for clemency, stat
ing that highly inflamed public sen
timent had much to do with the con
viction. James Jewell, convicted in
Spencer county a year ago of con
federating with others, all of whom
were acquitted, to intimidate some
people in the neighborhood, was par
doned. It was alleged that the visi
tation was for the purpose of stop
ping a nuisance. The remainder of
the jail sentence of James and Henry
Allen, convicted in Casey county of
stealing a hog, was remitted. A
neighbor lost a shoat and as these
boys had traded some shoats with a
sister and hauled them at night, sus
picion was attached to them; but
Gov. Stanley said the record showed
the boys had good characters and he
believes they are innocent.
MASONS AT DANVILLE.
Tomorrow, Wednesday, the Dan
ville Masonic lodge will be honored
by a visit from Grand Master T. J.
Adams, of Louisville, and Deputy
Grand Master J. N. Saunders, of
Stanford, who will be the guests of
Franklin Lodge. Beginning at 7:30
sharp, the Masters degree will be
put on by the Danville team. A
great many Masons in neighboring
towns will be on hand for the occa
sion, as invitations have been sent
to lodges in all nearby cities. At
conclusion of the team work re
freshments will be served.
Bilious Attacks
When you have a bilious attack
your liver fails to perform its funct

food you eat ferments in your stom

nausea, vomiting and a terrible head
ache. Take Chamberlain's Tablets.
They will tone up your liver, clean
out your stomach and you will soon I

CHAUTAUQUA
NEXT YEAR
Assured by Action of Woman's Club
and Guarantees Success of
Present Continues Great.
The wonderful success of the
Chautauqua this year has assured
another next season. At a special
meeting of the Woman's Club held
in the Chautauqua tent Monday af
ternoon, it was v.oted to take steps
immediately looking toward securing
sufficient ticket 'guarantees to con
tract at once with the Alkahest bu
reau for an entertainment on simi
lar lines next year. Tho' all of the
members of the club were heartily
I in favor of holding a Chautauqua
next year, some thought that the
matter of contracting immediately
with any certain bureau should be
left open. They argued that the fact
that Stanford had supported so
splendidly the Chautauqua this year,
would insure them the highest class
of entertainers next ' season, if the
matter was taken up with several
Chautauqua bureaus, and that a se
lection of the course to be given
could then easily be settled by se
lecting the one offering the best pro
gram. It was finally arranged, how
ever, that the Alkahest bureau will
furnish the CKautauqua subject to
the privilege of the Woman's Club
selecting the program. A large num
ber of ticket purchases were guaran
teed Monday riight, and another
Chautauqua is a" certainty.
The continuation of the Chautau
qua program since Friday's report in
the I. J., has left little to be desired.
The remainder o'f the urogram after
the first two numbers, mention of j
which was made in last issue, has
been fully up to the standard set by
the opening numbers. The big tent
has been crowded each and every
night, the limit being reached, of
course, on Sunday l evening, when no
charge was made for the talk Judge
Alden gave. All of the churches dis
pensed with services, and a crowd
estimated at fromiU,000 to 1,500
heard Judge Aldenfs magnificent ad
dress. Notwithstanding ,the very attrac
tive and entertaining musical fea
tures which have been provided, and
other forms of amusement and enter
tainment, Judge Alden is easily the
star of the? whole?- program. He
spoke Saturday -riigbfcion "The Needs
of the Hour" and .charmed everyone
who heard him. Judge Alden is a
master 6f the- English,, language ; a
student of men !UFl?ffairs possessed
of the rare quality of being able to
impart to others in entertaining
style his wide range of experience
and study.v Of magnificent voice,
and splendid presence before an au
dience, he carries his hearers com
pletely with him at all times. He
dominates their attention, sways their
emotions at will, and entertains them
constantly. A great deal of objec
tion was heard among prospective
Chautauqua goers when it was found
out that William Jennings Bryan
could not be secured. Bryan as a
Chautauqua attraction is without a
peer in the world, but as a Chautau
qua speaker he hasn't a thing on
Judge Alden, in the opini.on of the
writer who has now heard them both
on the Chautauqua platform. Both
Saturday and Sunday nights Judge
Alden spoke for r.bout an hour and
a half, and so intense was the inter
est of the great audiences in every
thing he had to say that a pin could
have been heard to drop almost, so
undivided was attention given him.
Friday the Hampton Court Singers
gave a very artistic and delightful
evening of music and musical fea
tures. The- work of all four of the
singers was splendid, the final play
let," "A Kerry Courting" being es
pecially enjoyed, as was also the "pi
anologue" of the attractive accom
panist. Saturday afternoon Rev. Mahoney
gave an interesting and instructive
lecture.
Monday the Royal Welsh Quartet,
survivors of the Lusitania disaster,
pleased a large audience with their
singing, and a description of the
sinking of that great liner by a tor
pedo about a year ago, told in sim
ple style by one of the survivors
gave an added interest to the num
ber. This afternoon and tonight the
Beasey sisters entertain with song
and story, and will conclude the
Chautauqua program for this season
with a delightful program, which will
undoubtedly draw a large audience.
Each and every speaker has been.
loud in his praise of the work ot the
Woman's Club and the system and
general smoothness with which ar
rangements have been carried out.
Judge Alden paid a high tribute to
the artistic ability of the local la
dies who had charge of decoration of
the stage. He said that the local
Chautauqua platform was decorated
more handsome and tastefully than
any hehad every spoken upon, be
fore. RAISES FIRST HUNDRED.
Mrs. J. M. Kelly, of Lexington, has

BOOTLEGGERS
ON ROCK PILE
Three More Gentlemen From Mil-
ledgeville Feel Iron Hand of the
Law Thro' Heavy Fines.
The Moreland Law and Order
League again invoked the mailed fist
of the law, and landed another right
in the solar plexus of the illegal li
quor sellers of Milledgeville. Lead
by Col. John B. Dinwiddie, this fear
less organization made up of the
best people in that section of the
West End, have secured the evidence
which, they say, will put every boot
legger who operates in their commu
nity entirely out of business. And
they are losing no time in going
about it.
Three alleged bootleggers were
before Judge Bailey in the county
court Monday, and two of them see
ing the array of testimony against
them confessed guilty. These were
Brack Reid, a brother of the famous
outlaw Charley Reid, who is still in
hiding from that ?3,00D fine and
the other wis Jonas Ingram, father-in-law
of Charley. Each confessed
guilty. Brack Reid was given a fine
of $50 and 10 days in jail at hard
labor on each of four charges; In
gram caught it to the same tune.
Frank Reid elected to go into trial
of the case against him. It was
shown by the railroad's records that
he had procured a total of 19 gal
lons of whisky since the 4th day of
last January, and a number of prom
inent citizens testified that his gen
eral reputation in that community
was that of an illegal whisky seller.
The only witness that Reid put on
the stand said that was his reputa
tion. Judge Bailey fined Frank
Reid $100 and gave him 40 days,
and Jailer DeBorde took the trio to
the rock pile in the county work
house, where they are now busily
engaged in making little ones out of
big ones.
BUYS HORSES FOR ARMY.
Mode Nichols, promient horseman
of Lexington, spent last week in
Boyle county, buying horses for the
United States government, which has
directed that $10,000,000 worth of
horses and mules be purchased im
mediately for the military service of
the country. The prospective break
with Mexico has hastened activity in
providing this class of army equip
ment. In Boyle county, Mr. Nichols
succeeded in buying twenty-one hor
ses at prices ranging from $100 to
$125. Before going to Danville, he
purchased 200 head at Lexington, all
of which will be inspected before be
ing accepted by the government. In
addition to these army horses, which
will probally be used for cavalry and
artillery Service, Mr. Nichols bought
a fancy horse from Mack Hughes,
of Danville,, for which he paid $350.
All animals purchased by the gov
ernment, Mr. Nichos says, must be
between five and eight years old.
TO PICK CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN.
The State Democrat committees
have requested the county commit
tees to meet July 1st and name a
campaign chairman for each county
to conduct the fight against the Re
publicans this fall. Chairman W. O.
Walker, of the Lincoln county demo
cratic committee, has called the local
county . committee to meet on that
date and select such chairman. Lo
cal democrats are anxious that the
best possible man for the place be
selected. Lincoln is naturally very
close. It went 300 democratic in
1914 but only about 35 last year so
that the need for putting the very
best man possible at the job is ap
parent. LANCASTER COURT.
Garrard county farmers were too
busy cutting wheat to attend court
at Lancaster Monday, and as a result
the crowd was small and business
generally was quiet. There wasn't
a hoof of cattle on the market and
mules and horsese were a scarcity. A
few hybrids changed hands at $87.50
to $138, and several horses were
purchased for war purposes at $90
to $127.50 and that was the extent
of business transacted. Neither of
the Congressional candidates glad
dened the dear people with his pres
ence, but friends of both Messrs.
Helm and Montgomery were on hand
to sing their praises. It was too
hot to talk much politics, however,
and the boosters were not in all cases
given a welcome hearing.
FIRST NATIONAL'S DIVIDEND.
At the meeting of the directors of
the First National Bank late last
week the usual 3o semi-annual divi
dend was declared, payable on July
1st. So good has business been with
this popular financial institution, that
after declaring the dividend, over
$1,500 was carried to the undivided
profits, making its present suplus
and undivided profits over $30,000.
President J. S. Hocker and other
officials of this bank are being high
ly complimented upon making such a
splendid showing for the first six
months of the year.
Greatly Benefited by Chamberlain's
Liniment
"I have used Chamberlain's Lini
ment for sprains, bruises and rheu
matic pains, and the great benefit
I have received justifies my recom
mending it in the highest terms,"
writes Mrs. Florence Slife, Wabash,
Ind. If you are troubled with rheu
matic pains you will certainly be
pleased with the prompt relief which
Chamberlain's Liniment affords. Ob
tainble everywhere. .
DR. DAVISON A CANDIDATE
Lincoln Has Congressional Timber,
For Both Parties.
Stanford now has two candidates
for congress in the field in the
Eighth congressional district. Dr.
R L. Davison on Saturday filed pa
pers as candidate for the republican
nomination for congress, thus giving
Stanford and Lincoln county their
second entry in the at present four
cornered race, Congressman Harvey
Helm, who is seeking renomination
as the democratic candidate being
the other.
Opposed to Dr. Davison is Repre
sentative Tom Neat, of Adair coun
ty, but friends of Dr. Davison say
that he is certain to be nominated as
he has the entire Hughes "machine"
in this district behind him. Dr.
Davison and his friends in the dis
trict were lined up solidly in favor
of the man who won the republican
nomination for the presidency, even
against the leadership of Edwin P.
Morrow and other powerful men in
the G. O. P. That their foresight
was good is shown by nomination of
Hughes at Chicago, and should such
an unexpected calamity befall as the
election of Hughes and the return
of the Republicans to power in the
nation, Dr. Davison and his followers
would be right up on the front pew
when the dishing out the pie to the
faithful began. The fact that he led
his party in a losing fight as its con
gressional nominee, would hurt him
a lot, you can easily guess not. The
Doctor and his friends say that he
will make a vigorous campaign be
fore the primary in which they ex
pect him to win easy, and against
whomever may be the democratic
nominee, in the final. Dr. Davison
is at present Police Judge of Stan
ford. He is a brother of the late
George M. Davison, who squeezed in
to congress from this district a num
number of years ago when the demo
crats weren't looking, and who was
one of the real leaders of his party
in the state during the greater part
of his political career.
LOCAL CONTRACTOR A BIDDER

Lincoln Line Pulaski Sells Bonds.
Two hundred and fifty thousand
of the $300,000 Pulaski county road
bonds were sold Friday to James E.
Caldwell & Sons, of Nashville, Tenn.
The bonds bear 4 1-2 per cent inter

The PulaskL Fiscal Courts in ses
sion at Somerset received bids on
sixty-six miles of pike and work on
the construction of the six inter
county seat roads will begin within
twenty days. Twenty contractors
were on hand to bid on the roads,
including the Woodward Bros., who
are building such a splendid pike to
ward Crab Orchard, from Stanford.
They bid on Somcrset-Eubank road,
which comes to the Lincoln countv
line. A Knoxville firm bid on all of
the fnter-county pikes to.be built out
of Somerset, wiiile smaller contract
ors bid on the separate roads. Mr.
Woodward who returned to Stanford
Saturday after attending the meet
ing of the court itt Somerset, said
that the court will consider the bids
this week and he is confident of
landing the contract he is after.
THIRD BIRTHDAY PARTY.
Miss Ann Frances Pennington de
lightfully entertained a number of
her little friends with a birthday par
ty in honor of her third natal anni
versary at the home of her parents,
Dr and Mrs. T. W. Pennington Sat
urday afternoon. A pretty birthday
cake with three candles, was a fea

delightful time. The little guests
were George Proctor, Keith Masters,
Jane Murrell Foster, Gatewood Bai
ley, Roberta Baughman, Dan Stagg
Riffe, Edward Southard, Martha
Campbell and J. Smith Murphy.

Helm Gets Appropriation for Loca
tion in Stanford Through Con
gress Sub-Committee.
Stanford is to have a govern :r.e"t
building. Sounds good; doesn't It?
Several years ago Congreaemai Hr
vey Helm pledged his efforts in t..-fc
j direction and notwithstanda. to
fact that the city's population z. A
postal receir-ts are less than tK c
partmental standard, he has t r'
secured an authorization by th. -committee
on PubI.e Buildn g c
Grounds of $10,000 for which tj :
a site. This practically insures, it i
the appropriation will be in'-orp r. -ted
in the Omnibus Public Bui1 r . ,
Bill, which is to be reported ir t
House in a few weeks. Aftei tr
site is secured the matter of a ex
propriation for the building u.. i;
taken up and in a few short yea.,
and probably less, ataniord will ra
a government building of which sl:
will have a reason to be proud.
It is very appropriate that M-.
Helm should have made his home
town the exception, as he did in th.s
case, and the building will be a last
ing monument to his efforts for h.s
home people.
Much interest has already been
shown concerning the site for the
proposed building and many loca
tions have been suggested It is
hoped that one will be agreed upon
and secured that will be satisfactory
to Stanford's entire citizenship.
A public building is a good thing
for Stanford. Let us all join hands
in the promotion of it and place the
credit for it where it is due. E.C.W.
