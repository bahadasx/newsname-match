Today, according to the best Infor-
ination here, his Bouthernmost out-
jiost is in the vicinity ot J-.l alle, less
tnun titty nines from comma, uunnin,
the nialn liase. It is believed that
from Kl Valle, a large and mobile
force may be pointed eastward, in a
slrateglc position, toward the Mexiean
Central railroad.

ready loaded witit tlie, necessary sup

ready to be sturi'.'d.
There Is not a single wounded or

have been sent to the base hospital
at Columbus.
Trucks sent to Proul.
In the meantime every empty truck
which remained at Columbus has
been sent to the front to aid in
Kpeeily transportation of infantry.
Speculation on the border today
dealt with the possibility thai some
I .
action by the Mexicans may precipi
tate hostilities before the exchanges
between Washington and Mexico are
'concluded.
With the lines of tlie Americans and
Mexicans paralleling for at least one
hundred mid fifty miles, the rash ac.
tioii of some subordinate commander
might at any time embroil the main
commands. Tension, consequently,
grows with each hour.
ISeudj for Trouble.
Fear that events might be thus
hastened prompted border command
ers to redouble their vigilance. At all
points the soldiers were ready to
spring into action at a moment's no

Andres (Jareia, the Mexican consul

himself still optimistic that trouble
would lie averted.
"I do not see that there need be
war, from my Interpretation of presi

"These seventeen prisoners ought not
to offer an obstacle. We have re
ceived no information from the de
f.irto uuthorHies as to the questions
on hand, and the whole matter is up
to (Jeneral Carranza."
It is experted that seven Americans

afternoon from Chihuahua. With

Pimcho Villa, until recently at Santa

with the de facto government and
hat this was being used to induced his I
