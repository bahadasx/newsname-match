Ogden, Juno 21. "If I wero nd
vlser of the President of tho United
States, I would recommend tho Im
mediate occupancy of tho Mexican
states of Chihuahua, Coahulla, Son

lish an effectual blockado and tho
war would go no farther," said AAV.
Ivins of Salt Lake to tho Utah Bank
crs convention here today at the
conclusion of his address on tho Mex
ican situation. These utterances
wero vlgojously applauded, as was
tho principal part of his address that
many bankers said they considered
tho featuro of the convention.
"Tho cause of Mexico's trouble be
gan moro than 300 years ago," ho
said, "and Is the direct result of
oppression of about 14,000,000 per
sons by the million persons of Span
ish blood who hold most of tho land
and hold the others In peonage., Un
til something Is dono to break up
tho largo estates so that tho Mexi
cans may get land of their own, un
til the system Qf oppression is de
stroyed, schools are established and
tho masses given tho opportunity to
administer their own affairs, riots
and resolutions will continue and tho
vast resources cannot bo developed
J w by American capital.
m Business of tho eighth annual con-
Iventlon of tho Utah Dankers Asso
c'atlon was concluded this afternoon
with the election of Ellas A. Smith
of Salt Lake City as president of tho
association to succeed M.. S. Drown
ing of Ogden; J. G. M. Barnes of
Kaysvlllej and J. B. Murdock, wero
elected vlco presidents, and Joseph
E. Shepard, cashier of tho Cache
Valley Bank at Logan, was reelected
to tho otuce of secretary and treas
urer. Logan's banks were all represen
ted at tho convention. Many iiib
Jects of Interest not only to tho
bankers but to tho state at large,
were discussed. As tho bankers re
alize that they are tho custodians
of the stato's finances It Is up to
them to aid Industries that will tend
toward tho development of tho states
resources,
A paper on tho sugar Industry was
read by Fred G. Taylor, secretary of
tho Amalgamated Sugar Company,
which wbb quite opportuno and
brought many facts rclatlvo to sug
ar making and Its requirements to
tho earnest attention of the bankers.
Somo history on tho early uso of
sugar as far back as 300 years 11. C.
was prcsonted and tho h'story of Its
development slnco that tlmo up to
tho prosent. Tho last two hundred
I years tho industry has Increased to
H vast proportions and the uso of sugar
H Ulkowiso Increased. It was 'shown
that sugar is 98 per cent food valuo
I and is far moro nourishing than
beet or flour.
H ' One fact was brought forth that
seemed qulto astonishing to tho con-
vontlon, when Mr. Taylor stated that
H our United States consumes annual
H ly 4,000,000 tons of sugar while she
produces only 1,000,000 tons or "no
H fourth tho sugar consumed in our
H country1. Wo havo been accustomed
to obtaining our deficit from Cuba,
PL Porto Rico and somo of tho Pacific
JK Isles but last year England and
TtXQ Trance; being unablo to, obtain their
F necessary sugar In Europe, camo to
j theso countries and purchased thftlr
M supplies, thus leaving America short
H In her requirements.
W When It is realized that America
H needs 3,000,000 tons of sugar more
H than she now manufactures and tho
H sugar costing us $80 per ton, it can
Vm read'ly bo seen that America should
I wako up to hor requirements, raise
R moro beets, build moro factories and
M make a strenuous effort to retain
H moro of this sugar money in pur own
K country.
