A telegram from Trevino. announc

Notwithstanding the statements of

They are counting upon the pressure

reports that the people of Ihe South

the fruit trees suffered considerably.
The storm reached its greatest vio

overturned as was his barn. The wa

out of its hanks. However, the prop

HEPPNER STORM
MUCH INFLATED
FORD CAUGHT BY
AND DESTROYED
A
ONCE
Reports coming In today from over
the county and neighboring counties
indicate that the storm of yesterday
afternoon was one of the most violent
that has been experienced in recent
years. The wind was almost a cyclone
in some sections and the rain fell in
veritable cloudbursts in a number of
places. The brevity of the storm was
ai: that prevented great property
loss.
Here In Pendleton the storm did
not reach its maximum violence but.
nevertheless, considerable damage
was done. The tops and limbs were
blown off many trees and some of tha
younger ones were completely pros
trated. A good many w ires were car
ried down, causing some Inconveni
ence to telephone and light patrons,
some windows were blown in. a few
flues tumbled before the blasts and
some unsubstantial small buildings
toppled over.
North of Pendleton the water fell
In a deluge and rushed down Stage
Gulch. Cold Springs canyon and other
gulches in great, walls. The roads
were washed badly in places. At th
George Hoehlk place on ("old Springs
machine sheds were blown over, ac
cording to Henry Lorenzen who Is in
today. A rush of water down Stage
Gulch Carried Ed McBroom's auto a
mile and a half down the road.
Reports from Helix verify the bulle
tin published by the East Oregonian
yesterday. Water ran through the
streets several feet deep, filling base
ments and doing damage to sidewalks.
The railroad tracks were submerged
but the waters subsided quickly and
traffic has been resumed today,
siditms t'ndcrnilned.
On the O-W. R. & N. main line the
sidings at Campbell station and. Barn -hart
were washed out. the water un
dermining the tracks. This delated
traffic to some extent last evening but
today the trains are running on sched
ule. The fences along the right of
way are clogged with debris and tell
the story of the depth of the water.
Trees Blown Down.
Below the Eastern Oregon State
Hospital more than a hundred Cot

down, according to Dan P. Smythe
who came .in on the morning train
and who noted the damage from tho
car windows.
