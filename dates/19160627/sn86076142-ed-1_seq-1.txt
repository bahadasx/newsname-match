(Bf Aaaoclatrd Prraa.1
WASHINGTON, June 27. There
were clear indications that If tbe
American cavalrymen captured by
Mexicans at Carrlzal are not released
within forty-eight hours action will
be taken by the United States. The
Impression prevailed among officials
that Wilson would not await beyond
Thursday.
While diplomatic aspects of the
criBiB waited for an answer from
Ctrranza the action of the war de
partment hastened mobilization of
tbe guard on the border. It is cer
tain that no aggressive military ope
rations will be undertaken until a
iibNtantial number of troops Is avail
able to back up Funston's regulars.
Wilson's first step, Bhould he decide
to force (he issue, will probably be to
lay the situation before Congress.

WASHINGTON, June 27. Reports
coming jto Washington from all sec

cans enthusiastic over the party uni
fication and confident of victory. On
the other hand, there is apparent
disaffection and discouragement
among the Democrats. And there are
many evidences of the reasons for
the difference. Republicans are en
tirely satisfied with their candidate;
many Democrats are dissatisfied,
though acknowledging that there was
nothing to be done but renominate
Wilson. They realize that Wilson's
record is such as to place the party
on the defensive a situation em
barrassing to any party. Instead of
being a help to the ticket, Wilson's
record will be a load to be carried.
For Instance, party workers who
are not high in the administration
family, realize that the country at
tributes the bard times of 1913-14 to
the Democratic tariff,'' and that the

to the war has merely emphasized
the seriousness of the depression that
preceded it. Honest Democrats do
not relish the task of trying to con
vince people that the administration
leaders are correct In their claim
that the Democratic party brought
prosperity. In fact, there are many
communities where very little of the
revival of Industry has been expe

prosperity argument there. ,
Again, few Democrats take pleasure
in defending the administration's rec

though the president manifested sign
of more firmness about convention

than helpful to party workers, be

Steps are being taken to re-establish

school, which has been dormant tbe
past year because of lack of student
material. To re-establish the school
it is required that a petition, signed,
by at leaBt five bona fide applicants
for the course, be approved by the
board of trustees of the school dis
trict and by the board of county
commissioners. The school is under
the control of the State Board of
Education, who act as the county
training school board. Graduation
from this school entitles the graduate
to a teacher's certificate good for
three years In any of the elementary
schools of the state. Credit at the
university is also given for the work
completed in the county normal and
this wise provision gives high school
graduates an opportunity to save a
year's time on their university course
if they are expecting to prepare for
teaching.
In order to start the ball rolling
all prospective applicants for tha
re-establlshment of the Nye county
normal training school a'-j requested
to meet in the assembly room of the
