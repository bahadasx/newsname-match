to Bid Them Farewell-
Many Pathetic Scenes
Enacted.
•.
BEST WISHES 00 WITH THEM
At the Train Polled Ont There Were
Many Sad Handshakes—Those
Left Behind.
No mere' words can fittingly ex
press the feelings of the throng of
people assembled at the Northwes
tetn station yesterday morning as the
train bearing the boys of Company
and the staff officers, pulled out of
the city at exactly 8.52 o'clock.
Tears made their war unbidden,
down the cheeks of hundreds who
had no son, brother or husband
among the company, but in wjjose
heart swelled that strange feeling
called patriotism, which no man can
define. Flags, huts and handker
chiefs were waved in the air and a
tremendous handclapping accompan
ied the glow outgoing of the train
hearing the Eagle Orove company
and our own boys in khaki.
At 8 o'clock that morning the pa
rade formed at the armory and
marched to the station grounds, led
by the Grand Army of the Republic,
the Second Regimental band and the
boys of Company C. A volume of
cheers and handclapping accompan
ied their march to the station and
the great crowd already assembled,
there gave the boys an ovation as
they approached. Arriving, the
band gave two or three selections,
after which the company began en
trapment. A line formed on each
side as the lads mounted the steps of
the coaches and general handshak
ing ensued.
The train stayed in the yards
probably twenty minutes before pul
ling out and during the interim a
great handshaking, expression of
good wishes and farewells took
place.
Silently standing by were the "old
boys" of the Grand Army, their
faces plainly evincing the thought
of that other time over fifty years
ago when they too, surrounded by
loving friends and neighbors, march
ed away with the same old flag flut
tering proudly in the breeze, its
folds now immeasurably dearer with
the years of struggle and suffering
Indelibly written on every red bar.
Eighteen years ago, a throng of peo
ple stood about another train in this
city bidding goodbye to another com
pany who offered their lives and
their services for all that America
stands for. Many of the same men
were in the company this morning.
Col. N. P. Hyatt. Maj. P. J. Lund,
Color Bearer W. S. Norton, and pos
sibly others were in the number who
left for the Spanish American war.
Although they never went farther
than Chattanooga, some of the per
ils they there encountered of fever
and disease w{re as great as others
(aced on the battlefield.
,i And the boys themselves, yesterday
morning, what of them? With sus
picious redness about the eyes, but
with a smile on every face, they
"jollied" from the car windows, and
Bhouted greetings and farewells to
friends too far away from the car to
reach with a handshake. Only now
and then as the train began to move
out, was there to be seen a convuls
ive sobbing of some khaki breast.
The boys were bravery personified
the departure made all the harder
by weeping friends, whose emotion
could not be concealed.
For a week the boys have faith
fully practiced under the efficient
leadership of Major Lund, utilizing
the school grounds, the streets, and
every available space for maneuvers
and the band, so newly formed, with
so many young boys among their
number, has practiced almost hour
ly. Faithfully and bravely they
have been the first to respond to the
call of the country, and the part
which remains for Webster City peo
ple is to see to it, as Col. Hyatt so
sagely expressed a few evenings ago,
that those who are left behind do

not suffer because of the absence of
the boys.
There are wives and children- and
aged mothers and fathers left be
hind these are the ones to whom
our,attentions should turn. Until the
red tape of the government has suf
ficiently unwound itself to admit of
their being provided for, there will
be suffering unless the citizens see
to it that such a thing is impossi
ble. The boys have been assured
that the warm hearts of Webster
City are with them let the hus

iers be doubly assured that those left
behind are included in the warmth,
The boys are gone how long no
one may even conjecture. Stout

LITTLE GIRL SER-
wiun
Jessie Boswell, Three Year Old Child
of Mrs. Lena Boswell, Victim
of Bonfire.
Jessie, the thf6& year old child of
Mrs. Lena Boswell, residing in the
1000 block on west Division street,
was the victim of a serious burning
accident Friday forenoon about
14:30 o'clock when her clothing
caught on fire from a children's bon
fire in the yard. The child was not
observed for a few moments and a
milkman driving by was the first to
discover the child's peril he ran to
the scene and helped the mother,
who had then arrived, in extinguish
ing the blaze.
Two physicians were summoned
and the burns found to be fairly ex
tensive over the side, chest and arms
but not dangerously deep. They are
considered professionally as first and
second degree burns. The little one
is resting easier today and her re
covery is looked for.
This is the third serious accident
of the sort in the community within
a year, all resulting from children
playing with fire or matches. Little
ones should be watched with hawk
like vigilance in regard to bonfires,
which always fascinate and attract
them.

THE SENATE KILLS
FAMILY RELIEF BILL
The Upper House of Congress
Throws Wet Blanket Over the
... Country.
A few days ago the Freeman
Tribune published the fact that the
national house of representatives
had passed a resolution appropriat
ing $1,000,000 to be used to aid the
families of guardsmen who had re
sponded to their country's call. The
Freeman-Tribune was pleased that
such a resolution had passed the
house, but now comes the report
from Washington that the senate
has killed it.
There has been many things hap
pen in the United States senate to
weaken the confidence of the people
in that body and this is but another
one. Perhaps there is some good
reason why the families of soldiers
should not be assisted by the govern
ment, but if so the Freeman-Tribune
is too dense to fathom it. Had the
senate deliberately set about to
throw a wet blanket over the en
thusiasm of the guardmen a better
coursc could not have been pursued.
It is to be hoped that when the
sleeping old upper house, which is
always about twenty-five years be
hind the procession, finally wakes
up to the fact that the United States
is confronted by a serious condi
tion it will reconsider this matter
and do something worthy of the body
that has had among its members
some of the most illustrous and bril
liant and patriotic men of the na
tion.
QUEER OLD RELIC

James Webster, on F. A. Huddlestun

and Copybook.
James Webster, a young English
man, for the past year employed on
the F. A. Huddlestun farm in the
southeast part of the city, has some
interesting relics in his possession.
One of these is a copybook written
in the hand writing of his great
uncle, James Webster, when the lat
ter was a student in a boy's school of
England. Although Mr. Webster
knows that the name "Daniel" was a
family one for generations back, he
does not know whether or not the
Daniel Webster of oratorical fame in
America's youth was one of the fam
ily or not.
In all probability, however, he
was. The copybook bears in the

WEBSTER CITY, IOW. L, TUESDAY, JUNE 27, 1916.
FISHING REASON IS HERE.
Webster, 1814 and the writer was
the bachelor brother of Daniel Web
ster, grandfather of the possessor of
the book. The book is written close
ly in a beautiful hand upon thick
creamy paper, almost of the texture
of parchment paper. Quotations,
poems and grave and heavy dis
courses upon the paths of virtue and
the ultimate end of man, form the
subjects of the writing exercises.

«cttteo by .his grand­
father when the latter was a student
at a boy's school in Kingscliffe in
1812. The letter was written by the
English lad to his father to apprise
him of his homecoming for the vaca
tion period and the chlrography is
like copper plate. The beautiful,
stilted dignity with which the young
lad writes—"I have the pleasure to
inform you," and which with cau
tious. measured, respectful sentences
he "trusts" that his father's health
and that of his mother, his sister and
his brothers is good. Is quaint and
old fashioned enough.
To a present day American, howev
er, it seems a trifle heavy and one
wonders if the young boy of 104
years ago had no desire to call his
father "Dad," land to write joyfully
of the expected vacation.
These keepsakes are very careful
ly treasured by the descendant of the
writers along with other family
keepsakes. Mr. Webster has not
been home for .eight years and at
present has a brother fighting in the
trenches "somewhere in France."
THE FOOD SUPTIY

Have an" Abundance to Last For
Thirty Days—Would Cost Ap­
proximately $300,000.
Following is a list of supplies
purchased by the commissary de
partment to feed the members of
the Iowa National guard during
their stay in Camp Dodge. The
amount represents a supply for
thirty days:
81,000 pounds of beef.
29,000 pounds of bacon.
6,100 pounds of lard.
4,000 pounds of rice.
10,200 pounds of navy beans.
130,000 pounds of potatoes.
16,900 cans of tomatoes.
8,600 cans of prunes.
7,500 pounds of coffee.
21,000 pounds of sugar.
3,0000 cans of milk.
900 gallons of pickles.
4,000 pounds of salt.
3,000 pounds of pepper.
4,000 pounds of butter.
2,000 pounds of corn syrup.
More than two thousand candles
it is estimated will be used by the
guardsmen, if they remain at camp
thirty days. It 1b estimated the
cost of maintaining the troops at
Camp Dodge one month will be close
to three hundred thousand dollars.

Comes to Webster City to Get Son
Who Had Joined the Regi­
mental Band Here.
A young man by the name of Dale
W. Kitzmiller of Parkersburg joined
the regimental band here a few days
ago and wanted to go with the oth
ers to the front. Sunday his fath
er appeared upon the scene and pro
ceeded to make a spectacle of him
self. He condemned company offic
cers and others in authority, declar
ing that the boy was not of age and
had no right to join the band with
out the consent of his parents. The
fond father wanted to make a law
yer out of the lad and thought he
could not get much learning in
Blackstone while in Mexico. The
father didn't seem to take much
stock in patriotism and evidently
thought if there were to be war it
should be the other fathers who
should let their sons go. Mr. Kitz
miller's son of Parkersburg is a lit
tle too good for his country's ser
vice—according to the father's view.
The lad, however, had evidently
got word of the coming of his fath
er and made a disappearance. He
will probably show up in Des Moines
or elsewhere and go with the band
if he can. He is made of the right
kind of stuff, even though handicap
ped at home. The Freeman-Tribune
predicts that if the life of Dale W.
Kitzmiller is spared he will amount
to a whole lot among the men of his
generation.

Will Add Another Boiler and Extend
Main East on Second Street in
Near Future.
The stockholders of the Central
Heating company held a meeting
Saturday and decided to put in an
other boiler like the one already on
duty. This is made necessary by the
increasing business, as several large
buildings are to be added to the
heating service next winter. It is
also expected that the heating main
will be extended east on Second
street to take care of new customers.
The company is getting one of the
best heating plants in the state and
every improvement' being made is of
the best and most' substantial char*
acter. When the new boiler is in
stalled they will have a capacity to
heat approximately 25,000 feet of ra
diation.

FINE SERMON BY REV. METCALF
Choirs of City are Massed and Fur­
nish Splendid Music—Ideal
Weather.
The weather Sunday was ideal
ly perfect for an out of door meeting
and the court house park was full
of hundreds of people who gathered
to do honor to the soldier boys of
Company and the boys of the Sec
and Regiment band which accom
panied them to the front.
The parade from the armory was
made at 2:45 o'clock, and headed by
the band, marched to the vicinity of
the bandstand in the park, near
which chairs were placed for the
seating of the company. Scores of
people brought campstools and
cushions to seat themselves, while
others stood or walked about under
the trees. Rev. E. G. Hay, pastor of
the English Lutheran church, an
nounced each number on the pro
gram, which on account of the late
ness of the hour, when planned, was
Unable to be announced through the
newspapers of the city. Printed pro
grams were distributed through the
audience after assembling, and the
first hymn, "Onward Christian
SOldiers," was Sung with a will by
the mingled choirs of the city and
the assembled audience.
Following the scripture reading
by Rev. J. O. Staples, pastor of the
Baptist church, an anthem, Kip
ling's "Recessional," was beautiful
ly rendered by the choir, after
which Rev. C. V. Pence gave the
prayer.
The congregational singing of
"America" preceded a splendid ser
mon—"The Good Soldier"—by Rev.
Arthur Metcalf, pastor of the Con
gregational church. The speaker
praised highly the quality of the
courage which had caused the boys,
not already members of Company C,
to enlist when the need of their
country was apparent. He said that
the qualities of the good soldier
were the same the world over—pa
triotism, courage, steadfastness, all
of which make the good soldier—
come from each battlefield.
Rev. Metcalf stated that no one of
the five previous wars of America
had been wars of conquest all had
been for some principle involved,

and this thing alone is enough to in

The speaker closed -by directing.

sue America heartily espoused and
this measure w^s followed up with
schools. After the acquisition of the
Philippines, America sent a shipload
of amunition to the islands—the
amunition having been school teach
ers! And our little brown brothers,
as they have been called, are re
sponding to the efforts of America
to educate and Christianize them.
The address was an excellent one
and hearty applause followed. The
hymn, "God Be With You Till We
Meet Again," was sung by the audi
ence and choir as the closing num
ber, accompanied by the band.
In the evening at 7:30 o'clock,
dress parade took place on the
school grounds witnessed by hun
dreds of people who have attended
the every movement of the boys.
The improvement in the maneuvers
of the company has grown from day
to day and the way they have whip
ped into shape in the last six days
has been astonishing.
On Saturday evening at 7:30
o'clock the school grounds were lin
ed with people to watch the' dress
parade—salute to the flag and the
drilling of the company—which
took place by. the company and
band. -When it is considered that a
good many of the boys in the com
pany have only been members for a
few days, the quickness with which
they have accustomed themselves .to
command and their trim, square
shouldered appearance, awakened a
thrill of pride in every person there
assembled.
No Camping in Park.
Of late there have been a few re
quests of the park commissioners for
permission to camp in Nokomis park
along the river bank in this city.
This has been refused as the park is
too small to admit of camp life in
addition to the many picnic parties
held almost daily in this beautiful
little resort. Permission under cer
tain conditions, will however, be
granted Webster City residents to
camp in Kendall Young park during
the spring and summer, and doubt
less several families will avail them
selves of the privilege.
