WILSOM IS
WAIT AM
For a Definite Reply from Carranza
to Note Demanding
Men's Release.
WAR DEPARTMENT IS BUSY
Every Day's Delay in Evident
Break Sees Our Troops in
Better Position.
AtSOCIATKO
WASHINGTON. June 27.?'There
were clear indications today that if
American cnvelrymen captured by
Mexican troops ut Carrizal were not
released within forty hours action
would be taken by the United States.
The impression prevailed in ofllclal
circles that President Wilson would
not wait beyond Thursday at the latest
and possibly not beyond tomorrow
afternoon for a detlnlte reply from
the Carranza Kovornment to the note
demanding the immediate release of
the prisoners.
While the diplomatic aspects of the
crisis awaited Carranza's action, the
war department drove forward Its i
efforts to hasten mobilization of the
national guard on the border. It is
certain that no aggressive military j
operation can be undertaken until a
substantial number of state troops is
available to back up the regulars who
unquestionably would lead any movement.
Mexican officials hero have expressed
the opinion that General
Carranza would surrender the American
prisoners, whatever the reply he j
might make to the demand for a
formal statement of his purposes.
every day's delay in what seems
the inevitable break in relations with
the Mexican government sees the <
army in better position for the swift
sctlon that may follow. This has Influence
against pressing matters to
an immediate issue. Had the border
foces been sufficient to rlease the regulars
for aggressive operations it is
thought possible a time limit would
have been included in Secretary I^an-,
sing's nqip.
Advices from General Funston indicate
that trains loaded with state
troops alio sweeping southward from
Cmnny parts of the country. Addl*
tional regiments are entraining or
receiving the last necessary equipment.
At the war department and in
Congress hurried measures are being
taken to provide supplies promtly for
the army ordered to the border.
A dflnite statement of the number
of guardsmen enroutc to the border
was not available. Secretary Baker's
order directing that movement of
these troops he arranged between
General Funston and the officers
commanding the various army departments
cut out the red tape and
delay incident to centralization of
ail this work in Washington.
Another task aided by delay in an
outbrea kof hostilities is that of getting
Americans out of Mexico. The
number there has been reduced to
less than a thousand.
Secretary Daniels stated today
that the navy department had now
supplied ample accommodations for
all refugees who may reach *the sea
coast. The Atlantic fleet will not
be ordered to Mexican waters, he
said, except "under exceptional conditions."

fNCATION
VISITS CITY
And Praises the Work of the
Local Water Works and
Sewerage Board.
Charles !? Hoover, noted chcmiRt in
charge of the Columbus, O.. water purl- j
tlcatlon works and an expert bacteriologist
and author. Ih a business visitor
in the city and iA spending some
time with local water works officials.
After a study of the local nurlflra
Hon work* Mr. Hoover spoke entertainingly
of the rapid sand process of
filtration Installed at Columbus,
Clarksburg and elsewhere throughout
the country, as follows:
"There exists much misunderstanding.
prejudice and mystery concerning
the art of water purification. I shall ,
describe briefly the operation of the ,
Columbus, 0? water purification plant,
and show that the chemically purified
wnter Is not "doped" with chemicals ,
as Is sometimes stated by those who
do not understand tho changes which
take place In the chemical treatmunt
of a public water supply.
"Few cities have had so difficult a
public water supply problem to solve |
as did the city of Columbus, O.. for
years prior to the Installation of the
present plant, sewage polluted water
from Alum creek and lite Olcnlangy
anu suioto rivers was pumped Into the
uismmmng sysiom or tne city. .
The water polluted with sewage wns .
at times extremely muddy and as the (
watersheds of the aliove mentioned
streams are underlaid with limestone
and rock the water passing over and
through this limestone was very hard. \
The hardness was so excessive that the
water was not satisfactory for domestic
or commercial uses. It would not (
lather freely with soap and when used
for Itollcr feed purposes was very Injurious
lo the hollers due to the large
amount of scale deposited on the holler
tuhea. The water was so Impure
that severe epidemics of tynhold fever \
see re of frequent occurence, and Col- ,
ttmbus was recognized as having perhaps
as high a typhoid fever death I
rate as any large city in the 'United.
Slates. In 1904. just a yoar previous ,
to the time work was started on the ,
Improved water supply, the typhoid
fever death rate was 139 per 100,000,
a disgrace to any American city.
"After heavy rains the water was so
turbid or muddy that It was almost
Impossible to use It for domestic or 11
other purpose*. The reader will per-11
hap* realtxe how muddy the water
really waa by knowing that now after'
heavy rain* aa much aa 260,000 pound*
