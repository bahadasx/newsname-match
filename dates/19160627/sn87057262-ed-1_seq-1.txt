Four More Survivors.
COLUMBUS, N. M., June 27.—Four
more Carrizal survivors, two of whom
were in terrible condition from lack
of water and food, have been found

lines.
Hiding by day and crawling over
the desert at night, the men reported
having forced Mexican peons at the
point of guns to furnish them with
water.
Carranzista cavalry, apprised by the
Mexicans that the- American troopers
were at large, scoured the country
hoping to take them prisoners. An
American patrol found the four sur
vivors and immediately relieved their
want for food and water.
In nearly forty-eight hours no motor
transports, have come into Columbus

for the transportation of infantry in

papers print reports, that the people
of all southern countries sympathized
with the Mexicans in the present

the papers report, all regard the main
tenance of the American expedition
on Mexican soil as a flagrant viola

Americans continue to arrive here
from interior points, but it is learned
that several who went to Vera Cruz
last week, now contemplate returning
to Mexico City. Messages pledging
American forces were partly
provocative of the Carrizal battle.
Carranza's refusal to release the
American prisoners in Chihuahua City
or an unfriendly statement of attitude
toward relations with the U. S., doubt
less would cause immediate visitation
of the "gravest consequences" with
which President Wilson threatened
him. On the other hand, compliance
with the request for favorable intent

Pretext for Intervention.
MEXICO CITY. June 27.—The
charge that the United States is at
tempting to seek a pretext for inter
vention in Mexico is made by Foreign
Secretary Aguilar in a message to
the Latin-American republics.
"Apparently the American govern
ment without adequate reasons for
declaring war on Mexico, wishes to
make hostilities inevitable," wired
the foreign secretary. "Mexico should
win or succumb with dignity."
An earlier communication sent to
the Latin-American republics last
night, declared that the United States
is concentrating forces against the
Mtoxiosn border and tl*al war appears
inevitable.
"'The Mexican people are ready to
defend their sovereignty and inde
pendence at any cost of blood and de
struction of their -welfare," said the
communication. "The Mexican gov
ernment firmly believes that the atti
tude of the American government Is
not in accordance with its friendly
protests to the pan-American repub

little chance of getting out alive, the
