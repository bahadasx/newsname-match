BETTER HAY
Growing hay for market is becoming one
of the leading features in farming in many
sections of the United States. Like growing
grain and raising livestock, the hay industry
requires speciHc knowledge and the RIGHT
kind of machinery. We can't supplv the
knowledge, but wo CAN soli you the
kind of Machinery, and we waut you not to
think of buying a
Mower, Rake or
Baler
until you have talked it over with us.

Washington, Juno 20 BfTorts to
ward Katln-American mediation In tho
Mexican crisis favored by Carranzn of
llelnls, collaiised today without havliiK
reached tho stogo of n formal proposal
of the United States.
It wan made plain by Secretary
I-ansliiK to iKiiado Cahleroti, Minister
of Ilollvla, who called with tho Inten
tion of asking whether the I'nlted
States would entertain an offer of ser
vices of Its southern neighbors to aid
In avoldlnK war, that the Washington
Government bccs nothing in tlie situa
Hon that would warrant arbitration
iirnccedlncs.
Mr. Lansing talked with tho Minister
for half an hour, nnd Is understood to
have told him that the blame ir the
crave outlook rested squarely upon
Gcnernl Carranza. The attitude of the
United Stntes was so fulty outlined that
Mr. Cahleron did not mention directly
tho original purpose of his visit.
House Adds In Army 1IIII
The House passed the annual army
aimroprlatlon bill after adding $20
000,000 for emergency purposes dur
ing the brief debate that preceded the
vote. An urgent deficiency bill enr
rylng $2.ri,000.000 for National Ounrd
pay, equipment and transportation was
framed In the committee for presenta
tlou to tho House tomorrow.
Railroad representatives were called
into consultation at the War Depart
ment to hasten tho shipment of troops
and supplies to tho border. A definite
plan was mapped out under which
Untile experts of nil lines will work
with army quartermasters in routing
trains. Special marks will distinguish
cars with army supplies, insuring them
right of way nt all switching points
Plans for military censorship over
newspapers, magazines and other pub
Mentions, as well as over lines of conv
miinlcntlou, were talked over. A reso.
lutlon conferring broad powers In this
regard upon the President was trained
for submission to Coniiress.
Draft Resolution Passed
In the Senate tho National Guard
draft resolution was passed, with
amendments which will necessitate Ita
return to the House and possibly a
conference before Its final approval.
Army officials wait with impatteiico
the authority It grants to consolidate
incompete units of tho National Guard
They estimate that when tho regiment3
reach the border under tho now orders,
some companies will be promptly de.
pleted by the men discovered to be
physically unfit on final examination
If thoy can comblno these incomplete
units for immediate servlco ainl all
now companies as recruits are sent
South, there will be little delay In
getting all available men Into nctlve
service.
Indications tonight -were that 10.000
men ndditlounl might reach tho border
this week. In two weeks probably
50,000 could bo transported South and
within three weeks tho whole force
summoned under President Wilsons
call might bo moved.
President Expresses Appreciation
President Wilson expressed to call
ers today his appreciation of the an
nouuccnient of business houses thru
out the country that their- employes
would be permitted to serve with the
Vatlonnl Guard without loss of salar
ies or positions. Several employers
hnve sent such nniioiinconients direct
to tho White House nnd tho President
has written thanking them.

Holt .Heeling.
Chicago, Juno 2fi Hy n vote of 32 to
6, with nine members declining to
vote, the National Committee of tin
Progressive party today endorsed
Charles E. Hughes for President and
tho Hull Moose party practically went
out of existence ns a national politi
cal organization.
Tho decision to endorse tho Repub
lican candidate came at tlie end of a
stormy day. Tho fight In tho com
mltteo for Hughes' endorsement was
led by Charles W. Perkins, of New
York; James R. Gnrflold, of Ohio, and
Chester II. Powell of Cnlofornla.
The radical element In tho commit
tee, represented by Matthew Hale, of
New York; Henry F. Cochems, of Wis
consin, nnd John M. Parker of Louis
latin, vigorously protested against the
endorsement of nny candidate for
President and fought the majority nt
eery step of the proceedings. The
minority's first move was to insist
on an open session of the committee,
and It won this point after a number
of committeemen, led by Joint M
Parker, bolted tho meeting.
After Oscar King Davis, secretary
of the comuilttoo, had read Colonel
Theodore Roosevelt's letter finally de
clining the Progressive nomination for
President and urging that Mr. Hughes
bo supported by members of tho Pro
gressive party In order to dofea'
President Wilson, the committee voted
to accept Colonel Roosevelt's declina
tion, and took a recess for luncheon.
At the beginning of tho afternoon
session. Chairman Matthew Hale, of
Massachusetts, ruled the next order
of business was to fill the vacancy on
tho ticket caused by the refusal of
Colonel Roosevelt to run. Hnlnbrldgc

Colby, of New York, presented the
name of Victor Murdoek, of Kansas,
ohnlrmnn of the eonimltteo, now on
his way to Chltin. This led to a clash
between Rnyn'ond Robins of Illinois,
and Mr. Colby In which the He wns
passed. Mr. Robins snld Murdoek had
teld him he would not accept the
Presidential nomination. The propo
sltlon to run a third party ticket was
then defeated nftor a spirited debnte
by a vote of 31 to 1!!.
James R. Garfield next Introduced a
resolution endorsing Hughes for Pres
ident nnd directing the executive- com
mittee of the Progressive party to co
operate with tho Republicans In the
campaign.
Henry F. Cochems. of Wisconsin,
contended the committee had not au
thority to endorse any candidate and
that Its power was limited to the fill
ing of tho vacancy on tho ticket caused
by the refusal or Colonel Roosevelt to
run.
Chairman Hnlo ruled that tho mo
tion to cmlorso or recommend the Re
. publican candldnto for President wns
out of order and n debate of several
hours ensued.
Finnlly James R. Garfield appealed
from tho decision of tho chnlr and was
sustained 33 to 14. During the dis
cussion Raymond Robins Indicated he
would support President Wilson If the
Progressives did not put a ticket In the
Held.
John M. J'arkor made n fiery pro
test against any endorsement. He In
tlinnted he might vote for President
Wilson.
After endorsing Mr. Hughes the
committee unanimously decided that
tho action should not bo binding on
auv individual.
