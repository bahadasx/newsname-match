of the American note. Mr. Arredondo j
?id ho hari r>nt h^ard from his govern- j
ment since he communicated the inquiry
of six South and Central American republics
in regard to offers of mediation.
Special Agent Rodgers reported in an
overnight message received early today j
that he had delivered the note to the i
Mexican foreign office yesterday morning. |
He did not indicate how it had been re- I
ceived or when a reply might be ex- j
pected.
While the diplomatic aspects of the
crisis awaited Carranza's action, the i
War Department drove forward its efforts
to hasten mobilization of the
National Guard on the border It is
certain that no aggressive military
i operations can be rndertaken until a
substantial number of state troops is
available to back -up Gen. Funston's
regulars, who unquestionably would
lead any movement.
U. S. Will Accept No Excuses.
It looked very much today as if the
cause of the predicted break with Mexico
will come over the imprisonment j
of the soldiers, for the reason that the !
President will not accept any excuses
for their retention in prison or submit
to any protracted discussion of
whether they are in prison legally.
If President'Wilson go?.s before Congress
within the next two days it will
be for -the purpose of recommending to
that body that the administration be
given a free hand to handle the Mexi
can situation, ana parucuianv authority
to send troops immediately to
Chihuahua to attempt the release of
the prisoners.
Secret advices received by the administration
throughout last night and
this morning state clearly that the
Mexicans are concentrating troops in
the vicinity of Chihuahua, the capital
of the state of that name, with the evident
purpose of preparing for hostilities.
From the movements of Mexican
troops the official impression today was
that the Mexicans are riot prepared to
yield from their position that the
troops of the L'nited States must not go j
south, east or west from their present I
positions and that if they do they are j
subject to attack. Whether the Mexican
troop movements have anything to do
with the prospective answer of Carranza
to tSlfe note demanding release of
the prisoners could not be conjectured.
All that is known positively is that
Mexican troops are concentrating in
the Chihuahua neighborhood and along
flie lines of the American column.
May Address Congress Thursday.
It was said in well informed circles
tqday that President Wilson may tomorrow
night notify the leaders of
Congress that he wishes to address
that body on the Mexican situation
Thursday at noon. In fact, this is regarded
today as a certainty if Carranza
has not sent a positive answer
as to freeing the soldiers by that time
It is pointed out that unless Carranza
has made up his mind that he wants
war he will have the prisoners fjjeed at
once and then take his time discussing
tne other issues at stake, but if he
withhold answer or keeps the soldiers >
in prison his intentions are perfectly !
plain and will so be construed by the j
administration
What congressional action Mr. Wilson
is planning to ask is r.ot known. It
seems provable, however, that he would
desire specific authority under which
the National Guard could he employed ;
beyond the border and also authorization
for calling out volunteers.
Telegrams continued to flow into the
White House today offering volunteers
for service m Mex < o and promising aid
for the government if Hostilities begin
Hundreds of telegrams of an advisory
nature have also been coming in Some
of them strongly urge the President to
prevent war with Mexico, while others
assert that the people of this country
are definitely tired of condition* in the
nation to the south and want a housecleaning

promptly for the army ordered to the
border.
A definite statement of the number
of guardsmen en route to the border
was not available at the War Department.
Secretary Baker's order directing
that movements of these troops be
arranged between Gen. Funston and
the officers commanding the various
army departments cut out the red tape
and delay incident to centralization of
all this work in Washington.
Border Situation Satisfactory.
Gen. Funston is fully advised as to
what units are hastening to join him
and when others will be on their way.
Press reports from the border have indicated
a satisfactory situation. So
far as known. Gen. Funston has not
found it necessary to ap'peal to the
department for additional hurry-up
orders.
Another matter aided by delay In an
cutbreak of general hostilities is that
of getting Americans out of Mexico.
The number there has already been reduced
to less than 1,000, according to
State Department reports.
Secretary Daniels stated today that
the Navy Department had now supplied
ample accommodation for all refugees
who may reach the seacoast.
The Atlantic fleet will not be ordered
to Mexican waters, he said, except
"under exceptional circumstances."
Consular advices today from the few
State Department representatives remaining
in Mexico reported quiet.
Special Agent Rodgers at Mexico City
reported that he had delivered Secretary
Lansing s note to the Mexican for-"
eign office yesterday morning. Mr.
Rodgers made no comment in handling
the communication to the Mexican foreign
secretary.
Some Americans Will Remain.
A report from Frontera, near the
east coast, said ten Americans there
refused positively to leave Mexico.
Those still in Mexico City?a small
number?also are expected to remain.
Most of them are Americans with Mexican
wives. Fifty Americans at Mazatlan
are going to stay, about the same
number at Tampico and two in districts
near the border also are going to stay,
even in the event of war.
State Department officials called attention
today to the activities in the
United States of the Carranza bureau
of information in Mexico City. Reports
as to conditions and international relations
are telegraphed to the United
States by the bureau for publication.
Officials said the press, of the country
should scrutinize these reports carefully
before using them.
Discussion of the Mexican crisis occupied
today's brief session of the cabinet.
When it was over Secretary Lansing
announced there was no change in
the situation, that the administration
was awaiting word from Gen. Carranza,
and Secretaries Baker and Daniels said
no new army or navy orders had been
given.
ALL TO HAKVEST CKOPS.
Every Man, Woman and Child Will
Be Utilized in Work.
BUDAPEST. June 27.?With memories
of the 1915 weather fresh in mind, and
the freakish weather of the past three
weeks as a warning that a record crop
can easily be turned overnight into a partial
failure, the Hungarian agricultural
authorities have decided upon unusual
and radical measures to harvest the 1916
crops in the speediest possible manner.
The municipal local authorities throughout
the country have been empowered to
requisition for harvesting purposes the
services of every man, woman and child
at home, not serving the state in some
I indispensable way, at Axed wages. Prisoners
of war, working in non-military
concerns, also have been requisitioned
' for the harvesting, several thousand
workmen have been imported from Rus|
sian Poland and all the troops in the
unenvr n?v (in ur oj/dicu win Ufl iurj
loughed for the same purpose.
The ministry of agriculture has ac!
quired all available harvesting machini
cry for distribution among the peasantry,
and agricultural experts estimate that six
weeks of sunshine, after the long rains,
will result in the production of a recordbreaking
crop in Hungary.

supervision of the multitudirtoui

American force for efficient in

Overnight and early morning
reports from El Paso, Eagle Pass
Brownsville and other headquar
ters points indicated no aggres
sion by Mexicans.
Units Stationed to Advantage.
Units of the American army hav<
been stationed in such manner that al
most instant action could be obtaine<
by the commanding officer. No re
laxation of efforts to guard the bordei
towns and ranches from bandits hai
been displayed, but far more attentior
has been paid to marshaling the thou
sands of men along the border.
The units of the National Guard now
moving throughout the United States
are expected to begin arriving in Texas
tonight. Where they will be stationec
will not be made public here, and ir
most cases those commanding th
guardsmen have not been informed ol
their final destinations.
Some impatience was displayed __ai
Gen. Funston's headquarters t,oda>
that so much publicity already had
been given to the movement of troops,
and it was indicated as practically certain
that a censorship that would b
far reaching in its operation soon
would be instituted,
i To strengthen the garrison at Eagle
Pass a battalion of the 3rd Field Artillery
was ordered there today. The remainder
of the 3rd Field Artillery is
stationed at Eagle Pass and Laredo.
More Artillery Is Ordered.
Orders were issued for two more batteries
of the 5th Field Artillery at Fort
Sill, Okla.._to go to El Paso, and two
to Brownsville.
Gen. Pershing reported to Gen. Funston
that the two squadrons of the
11th Cavalry that had been sent toward
Carrizal in search of the dispersed
members of the two troops that
were engaged there by Carranza'r
forces have fallen back on the main
line.
Ambulance Company, No. 6, and Field
Hospital. No. 6, both of the regular
army from Fort Ethan Allen, Vt.,

The activity of Mexican troops at
Naco last night was explained today.
Information had reached headquarters
here that the Mexicans had planned to
sweep across the line to Bisbee and
there raid the office and storehouse of
the copper smelting concerns. The 22d
Infantry was rushed from Douglas to
Bisbee last night.
Peaceful Journey to Border.
EL PASO, Tex., June 27.?Nothing
untoward was noted on the trip northward
from Parral by six American mining
men, who arrived today, after
spending a week in getting from the
properties of the Alvarado Mining and
Milling Company to the border. They
heard nothing at Santa Rosalia concerning
Francisco Villa, recently reported
to be in that vicinity in the
Carranza service.
The men virtually were the only
Americans left in northern Mexico who
intend to leave the country.
Portuguese Repulse Germans.
I^ISBOX, Portugal, June 27.?A German
attack on Portuguese East Africa
last month was repulsed, the war office
announced in the following communication
:
"Germans attacked Unde tin Portufuese

REPUBLICANS SEE i
I NATIONAL VICTORY
I
: Members of G. 0. P. in Congress
Gratified Over Rer
turn of Progressives.
EXPECT TO CARRY
THE PIVOTAL STATES
Figures of 1912 Are Used as Basis
1
for Predictions as to
November.
Republicans in Congress are
] profoundly gratified over the
; whole-hearted support offered
i Candidate" Hughes by Col. Roosevelt
and the action of the national
committee of the progressive
party joining in the colonel's indorsement
of the republican
ticket. The feeling is general
among them that this virtually
assures a republican victory at
the polls in November, since it
promises the return to tne repub- <
lican column of the rank and file
1 of the progressives and personal
followers of the colonel who se- t
ceded in 1912.
The fact that reunion was resisted r
1 by a few of the committeemen is re- f
* garded as a non-essential. It is noted l
* that the objectors represented Louisi
ana, Wisconsin and other states whose *
adherence to the republican party is
i either impossible or of negligible im5
portance. The big fact is that states
j which voted for backing the republican
ticket included those whose electoral
vote will be decisive in the choice of a
President?namely. New York, Ohio,
California, Indiana, Illinois, Kansas,
Minnesota, Nebraska, etc. *
Means Support at P^ls.
Aside from the sentimental effect of
C9I. Roosevelt's acceptance of the republican
candidate and ticket, which is
by no means underestimated by the re
publican leaacrs, id me k*??*-n>.?i aoamance
01 support at the polls which a
glance at the returns of the election
of 1912 affords.
The leaders point out that there are
votes behind the colonel, votes the
withholding of which from the republican
ticket in 1912 elected President
Wilson and swept the democrats into
control of the House and Senate at the
same time. Two years later, in the
congressional elections, those progressixe
votes began to return, cutting
down the democratic majority in the
Hbuse from 167 to 31.
Since then there have been steadily
Increasing indications of the homecoming
of the progressives, as witnessed
in West Virginia and in other
instances, and as shown in the primaries
last spring. ?
Practical Foundation for Hope.
Contemplation of the figures of 1912
gives the republican leaders, as stated,
their most practical foundation of hope
for 1916. Making allowance for the
defection of a proportion of irreconcilables,
who. it is claimed. are not republicans
anyhow, ana who are written
off as a bad-account on the books,
the leaders still find ample grounds ~
for confidence in their ability to carry
some of the pivotal states.
Beginning with the closest, the middle
west group, they find that the com
blned progressive and republican vote
of Indiana was 313,274, against 281,390
democratic; Illinois, 640,011, against <
405,048 democratic; Ohio. 506.393. I
against 423.152 democratic; Michigan.
169.828, against 150.751 democratic. \
Then " there were Minnesota, with
193.190, against 106,426 democratic; Nebraska.
127,124, against 109.109 democratic;
Iowa, 281,594. against 183,376
democratic, and similar proportions of
L-ombined republican and progressive
supremacy in the other western states.
Among the eastern states there were
Kew York, with a combined progressive
and republican! vote of 845,440, j
Lgainst 655.476 democratic; New Jer- I
sey, 234,245. against 178,289, and. of
course New England, showing com>lned
majorities in excess of the demo:ratic
vote.
Would Swing States.
But that is not all: these figures reate
to the popular vote and are /
>rophetic of the vote for the- House '
ind for United States senators. The
'resident and Vice President are chosen
>y the electoral college, and it falls out
hat the aggregate republican and progressive
votes, if cast in 1916 in the J
tame proportion, would swing into the
epublican column the states which
lave the largest representation in the
Sectoral college. New York. Pennsylvania.
Massachusetts, Minnesota. New
ersey, Indiana. Ohio, Illinois. Michigan,
owa are depended upon to give the re- n
>ublicans a tremendous lead, to be fol- g
owed up by the adherence of the west- a
:rn states with fewer electoral votes. a
Of course, the republican hopes are
[ualified oy the fact that in order to j
vin the progressives in those states .
nust come back, but they say that the a
igures show that the states were re- Z
mblican prior to 1912, and they ask t
vr.at the democratic administration
las done to cause the progressive and a
e?)iiblican voters to change their H
>olitics and become democrats. They a
:ay that all the world knows what
aused the split in 1912, and they insist p
hat no such reason for dissension now c
