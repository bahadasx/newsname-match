WAS A GALLANT FIGHT
Capt. Boyd Twice Wounded
Still Led His Men Until
Killed In the Charge.
San Antonio, Tex., June 26. Capt.
Lewis Sidney Morey is safe, having
reached the main body of American
troops with two of his men.
Gen. Funston received a message
by telephone Sunday from Mrs. Morey
at Austin, Texas, that she had a wire
less message from him from "some
where In Mexico" to that effect.
Mexican troops fired the first shot
on the troopers of the Tenth United
States cavalry at Carrizal, but not un
til the American force, fearing an
ambush, had advanced in battle for
mation, according to a letter written
on the day of the fight by Capt. Lewis
Morey, commanding K troop of the
Tenth cavalry, and forwarded to Gen
eral Funston by General Pershing.
Capt. Morey wrote the letter at 9:15
a. m., on June 21 while hiding in a
hole about 2,000 yards from the scene
of the battle.;
Capt
Moreywas wounded and had
another wounded man and three un
wounded troopers with him.
ine tnree unwounaea men were
picked up by a detachment under
! Lieutenant Henry A. Meyer, Jr.. of
the Tenth cavalry and the letter was
brought to Gen. Pershing today.
Capt. Morey was left to die on the
desert from thirst and his wounds.
The men abandoned him at his own
order.
The three unwounded men had car
ried him according to their stories to
Lieut. Meyer from the hole where ,
he had hidden and made their way
nearly two-miles from the battlefield.
They were forced to stop and Capt.
Morey, believing himself hopelessly
wounded, ordered them to leave him.
They also thought him about to die
from loss of blood and thirst, and
obeyed.
The stories of the rescued men to
Lieut. Meyer were vague about the .
details, according to Gen. Pershing's
report to Gen. Funston
Capt.
Morey's letter told of the join-
ing'of C troop under Capt.
Charles I
T. Boyd and K troop under his own
command at Oio S;intn Dnmintrn nn i
June 20 and the advance together to
ward Carrizal at 0:30 in the morning.
There, they halted and Capt. Boyd
sent a courier to Carrizal asking per-j
mission or uen. reiix Oomez to enter
the town, saying that ho was going to
Villa Ahumada.
Gomez replied that ho would not be
allowed to enter the town but might
make a detour yround it. Fearing
tiiat they were about to bo trapped by
the Mexicans, who had moved out
from town during the parley, the
American troops deployed in battle
formation, mounted and moyed for
ward. The Mexicans then opened lire.
Capt. Boyd ordered his men to dis
mount and return the fire. Tho en
gagement lasted about an hour.
Both C and K troops advanced, the
former to tho position occupied by a
Mexican machine gun and the latter
closing in to one side. K troop also
was attacked from tho flank while a
detachment of Mexicans from tho
town reached tho rear of tho Ameri
can line and stampeded the horses.
The Mexicans succeeded in checking
tho American advance nd the Amer
icans first were ordered to fall back
and finally to scatter, each for him
self. Corporal Green, of Boyd's troop,
gave details of that part of the battle.
Tho Americans were flanked on
both sides by the Carranzistas, who

CLARK TO HEAD
COMPANY
L
Hopkinsville Man Will Take
Charge of the Murray
Company.
E. W. Clark, former Captain of
Company D of this city, left .yesterday
morning for Murray to take charge
of Company L there, of which he has
been appointed captain. Notice of
the appointment came Saturday night
in a telegram from Col. Jouett Henry
commanding the Third regiment and
assistant adjutant ceneral of Ken
tucky.
Capt. Clark has been connected
with the local military company for
about sixteen years, joining as a pri
vate and working up to the captaincy,
holding tho later position for nearly
ten years. He succeeds Capt. Mc
Cre at Murray who resigned some
time ago.
As soon as he reaches Murray
Capt. Clark says he will prosecute a
vigorous enlistment campaign to
bring the company up to full war
strength.
Gen. Felix Gomez, the Mexican lead
er, and Capt. Boyd. In front was a
concealed Mexican machine gun
trench, from which a stream of bul
lets unexpectedly was poured into the
American ranks.
Corporal Green said that Capt.
Boyd, although wounded in the arm
and shoulder by the first fire, immed
iately gave the order to charge, and
the detachment rode at top speed, in
a hail of bullets, directly at the trench,
capturing it just as the American
leader fell. The Mexicans retreated
to cover in a nearly adobe shack.
ueut. Henry Atiair assumeu com
mand and ordered a second charge,
which drove through the shack, scat
tering the Mexican command.
Green said he did not see Lieut.
Adair after this charge, and believed
that ho lost his life in it.
Meanwhile Capt. Lewis S. Morey,
commanding K troops, which also was
partly surrounded during the parley,
occupied another adobe house with
his men, from which he enrraged a
second detachment of the Mexicans.
Of the 84 men engaged, 12 are
known to have been killed, 22 are
prisoners and 38 have made their
way back to the base. The rest are
unaccounted for.

FACES AN
ULTIMATUM
Release of Prisoners Held at
Carrizal Is Wired to
Carranza.
WANTS IMMEDIATE REPLY
Upon the Reply Rests the
Question of War With
Mexico.
Washington, June 26. A demand
for the release of the American troop
ers taken prisoner at Carrizal, coupled
with a stern notification that the
United States expects an early state
ment of the purposes of the Caraanza
government was telegraphed to Mexi
co City Sunday by Secretary Lansing.
The note discloses that the state
department received a communication
from the de facto government .stating
that the Carrizal fight was the direct
result of orders to attack American
soldiers moving otherwise than to
ward the border, personally issued
by Gen. Carranza to Gen. Trevino
and by the latter communicated to
Gen. Pershing.
In the reply by Secretary Lansing,
Gen. Carranza is required to place
himself on record formally, and the
plain intimation lies behind the re
strained language of Mr. Lansing's
communication that force will be met
with force. Apparently, however,
the Washington government is de
termined that the de facto govern
ment shall not evade responsibility
before the world if war is forced
upon the United States.
