Mexico City, June 2". The charge
'hat tlii1 I'nirec. States is attempting to
i.eek a pretext for intervention in Mex-
ivo is male by Foreign Secretary Agui-
4 1 r in a message to tlie Latin-American
opublii',
"Apparently the American govern
irovernment, without adequate reasons
for declaring war on Mexico, wishes to
Make hostilities inevitable," wired the
oreign secretary. "Mexico should win
or succumb with dignity."
An earlier communication sent to the
! .utin-Ainerican republics last night de
clared that the United States is concen
trating forces against the Mexican
border and that war appears inevitable.
" J he Mexican people are ready to
defend their sovereignty and independ
ence at tiny cost of blood and destruc
tion of their welfare," said the com
n.iuiiicatii.n. "The Mexican government
I irmly believes that the attitude of the
A.mericnn government is not in accord
once with its friendly protests to the
fan-American republics, that the acts
Hgainst Mexico affect ull other oona
Vies of this continent and the friendlv
lies that bind them at this moment and
ciiould bind them in the future."
Think It Means Withdrawal.
Mexico City, June 27. Evacuation of
f-nn Oeronimo nnd Baehinivn by Amer
ican troops who moved northward
; roused high hopes here today that
President Wilson is preparing to with
draw General Pershing's expedition

The war department gave no explana
tion of the move. A telegram from
Ccncrnl Trevino announcing the evocu
oiion and declaring his purpose to nt
t ick the Americans if they attempted
to renccupy the towns, was given out.
Notwithstanding statements in Amer
ican newspapers that war is imminent.
strong optimistic sentiment persists
nong Mexican leaders. They are count
ing upon the pressure of other Latin
American countries nnd the fear of a
breach in the commercial relations be
tween Latin-America nnd the United
Sintos to induce President Wilson to
move cautiously. The newspapers print
reports that the people of all southern
' ountries sympathize with the Mexicans
i'i the present crisis. South American
diplomats, the papers report, all regard
Hie maintenance of the American ex
pedition on Mexican soil as a flagrant
puliation of Mexican sovereignty and
believe that the establishment of a
border patrol would prevent bandit
nrrds.
Americans continue to arrive here
from interior points, but it is learned
that several who went to Vera Cruz
i-.st weel; contemplate returning to
Mexico City.

CAPTAIN MOREY
TELLS STORY OF
CARRIZAL FIGHT
Brave Trooper Refuses to
Leave Adair, Who Died
la His Arms
MOREY, WOUNDED, LAY
ALL DAY WITH MEN IN SUN
Made Troopers Leave Him to
Save Themselves, But
Finally Reached Aid
Field Headquarters, via radio to Col
umbus, X. M., June 27. Captain Lewis
S. Morey of Troop K, of the Tenth'
cavalry, the sole officer to survive the
fight with Carrauzista forces uear Car
rizal, today sat on the edge of his bunk
in the thatched hut that is the head
quarters of the American forces and
told an attentive group of fellow of
ficers the dotnils of the first real trag
edy of this campaign.
Cnptnin Morey had spent the night in
the hospital after his arrival here by
automobile late Sunday afternoon. To
dny with his blood stained Bhirt remov
ed and his body refreshed nnd cleaned,
he was able to be about camp with his
left shoulder, through which a nnuiser
bullet passed, swathed in bandages.
He first visited General Pershing,
thn visited the regiment in what will
probably be one of the most remarkable
reunions of the campaign.
As he walked through the company
streets, flanked by tents nnd curiously
woven brush huts, quarters that men
and officers have built, there was no
cheering, no music, but from each group
he passed some officer with eager face
stepped forth ami grasped Captain
Morey 'a unmanned hand, exclaiming:
"Glad you're back. Congratulations."
Those were simple words, but they were
fervent, for no man of this command
had believed Captain Morey would ever
be with them ngain.
Officers Died Like Men.
Captain Morey told his story slowly,
with superb restraint and modesty. He
blamed no one, drove no conclusions and
offered no suggestions as. to what should
have been done.
He udded little to the tale of the
fight except to say that Captain Boyd
and Lieutenant Henry Adan- died like
men and that, in the firing That follow
ed the Mexicnr attack, the Carranzistas
seemed to be centering their fire on the
white soldiers.
Captain Morey's troop was on the
right final: when the "ball opened,"
as he expressed it, and he could follow
the charge of Troup C under Captain
Boyd nnd Lieutenant Adair only to the
fringe of brush into which men nnd
horses disappeared.
"Men of Troop C tell me," he said,
"that Lieutenant Adair died in an ir
rigation ditch with his head held by a
non-commissioned officer. There was
water in the ditch and Adair would
have pitched forward into it had he noi
been supported. I understand th non
commissioned officer left Adair in 'he
ditch at his order and went forward
toward Carrizal. Looking back, he saw
; Adair w ith glazed eyes nnd his tot-mi
wobbling against the sides or the ditch.
! So he went back and stayed with him
until lie died.
Boyd Killed in Cliargs.
j "Cuptuin Boyd was killed when his
troop made a rush for the Iren-ii in
. which the Carranzistas had machine
guns. Just how he died I do not know.''
! Morey told how his own small de
tachment, fighting on their - bellies,
withdrew until Morey, wounded in the
shoulder, found himself with sovou men
'behind an adobe wall near a dry water
j hole offering protection from bu'.ii ts
i but not from the sun.
"Three hundred yards to the south
were the Carranzistas, some mounted
mid somo afoot, fighting nnd yelling as
they advanced, emboldened by the
Americans' retreat.
"When I got behind the wall." re
sumed Morey, "I told the men I pur
posed to stay there. Those who wished
to go, I told to go."
Four men, including one who was
wounded, elected to try to escape and
Captain Morey said he saw them ascend
a hill -stretching away to the north.
"I never saw men act so strangely,"
said C'aptuin Morey. "They did not run
or seem to exert themselves in any war.
They simply moved away up hill as if
dazed (uid by doing go probably saved
us. We who remained behind the wall
noticed Carranza horsemen riding out
to flank them. It was apparent that
some of the Carranzistas had seen us
take refuge behind the wall and not
ing four trying to escape went in pur
suit, leaviug us unmolested."
Lay All Day In Sun.
Morev and three black troopers lay
in that hole behind the wall all the long
est day of the year without water while
the enemy boat the country on all aides.
Night came on and with it a drop in
temperature. Under the stars the
wounded officer and his men started

TO RELEASE ill
President's Demand For Re

livered Yesterday
IF NOT RELEASED ARMY

Mexican Secretary Told That
An Immediate Reply Is
Imperative
By Robert J, Bender.
Fnited Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, June 27. President Wil
son's patience" in awaiting release of
American prisoners in Chilumhua City
is limited to hours, not days.., ;
It mny bo stated that a definite re
ply from General Carranza relative to
his attitude is expected not Inter Jhaa
tomorrow night.
The state department, has been in
formed tho president's demands we'3
delivered to Mexican Minister of For
eign Affairs Aguilar yesterday. It U
understood Consul Kodgeis suggested to
Aguilar that an "immediate, reply
was imperative.
What lies beyond this, officials will
not discuss. Tho program of possible na
tion was taken up by the cabinet to
day. It is understood, that, in tho event
of Carranza's refusal to roleanej tha.
prisoners tnken in the Carrizal battle.
President Wilson will ask congress ta
permit tiso of armed forces .of the Uni
ted States to get tho troopers.
Prisoners Free First
Cabinet officers, before going lnto
session today with President Wilson,
were determined that farrnma mnst
make quick answer to American de
mands. A limit in days or hnnrs was
not set, but members felt fWruuza,
should not be permitted more than t.w
days provided the United States nole
wns delivered to him yesterday as jn
ticipated. The first chief's attitude rouM only
be conjectured. The guesses in offie:al
quarters were that he would be r.ono
too conciliatory and that he might foroj
trouble. At any rate, Cabinet men said,
his answer is the determining e'e.ment
in the situation rather than thu indi
cation that pcrhnps American 'forces
were partly provocative of the Carrizal
battle. ;
Cnrrnnzn's refusal to release the
American prisoners in Chihunhtm Oity
or an unfriendly statement of attitude
toward future relations with the United
States doubtless would cause immedi
ate visitation of tho "gravest eonse
qnenees" which Prosident Wilson
threatened. On the other hand, com
pliance with the request that a favor
able intent toward this government be
proved will smooth out a troublous
situation.
Secretary of War Baker reported his
supplemental order cutting red tape and
permitting national guardsmen to move
mnie rapidly toward the border. His
documents showed mobilization and
troop movements satisfactory.
Secretary Lansing's report, on rejec
tion of the Bolivian mediation offer
was approved with the added decision
that the Mexican problem for the pres
ent, at least, is beyond the mediation
stage.
President Wilson is anxious to avoid
trouble with the de facto government, if
he can do so honorably. In this feeling
he has the support of the niitioo, adiniu
istrutinn men siiid today.
"In oilier difficulties there has been
a great national upheaval for war,"
said d ii ariny man today. "In this one,
however, the nation has no war spirit.
There is no upheaval and if the presi
dent can nvoid a war he will have the
country behind him."
After the cabnet session, it. was
said Carranza's reply to the United
Slates' demands had not arrived nnd
f ill no outline of it was befoM the.
administration. Should the answer
prove unsatisfactory, it is believed
President Wilson will appear before
congress at once uskin for use of tho
armed forces as he sees noensmiiy and
at the same time sending Oarrania an
ultimatum demanding the rolnae of
the American prisoners in Chihuahua.
Otticials believe Carranza's answer
may be here by niglit. At any ratei itj
was felt tomorrow night should be the
dead line" for its receipt.
