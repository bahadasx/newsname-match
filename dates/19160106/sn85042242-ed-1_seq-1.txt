Premier Asquith Stirs Up a Horn*
et's Nest When Bill Is
Introduced.
JOHN SIMON OPPOSES
THE NEW MEASURE
Lord Kitchener Tells House of
Lords Bill Is Only a Tem­
porary Measure.
1'I!
..
London', Jan. 5.—The British gov­
ernment today definitely embarked
upon a policy of compulsory military
service, when Premier Asqnith sub­
mitted to the house of commons a
bill drafting eligible unmarried men
to military duty, and championed the
measure in a stirring speech on the
necessity of this step to meet tlie
growing exigencies of the war.
Th scene within the house of com­
mons was one of the most notaWe in
the history of that body, with the
benches packed with members, all the
ministerial seats beihg occupied.
Just back of Mr. Asquith sat Sir
John Simon, former home secretary,
the only member of tae cabinet,
whose resignation has been precipi­
tated by the bill.
i.Mr. Asquith began immediately af­
ter the house was convened and
spoke continuously for an hour.
Asquith on Measure.
Most of his speech was devoted to
a clear exposition of the details of
the measure, which, the premier de­
clared, was no abandonment of the
principle of the voluntary service, in
which he believed, but a temporary
measure limited to the duration of the
war and.' confined to a small class of
unmarried men who had not respond­
ed voluntarily to the country's needs.
Bill' a Necessity.
"I would have been .glad to do with­
out. this bill," said the premier. "My
confident expectation has been that
no such measure would be ^nesegsary,
but tt»at
x!rb"p«
and I now consider this bill a neces­
sity."
Sir John Simon was greeted heart­
ily as he rose to combat the premi­
er's contention. 'Hie expressed regret
at leaving the cabinet and paid a
tribute to Mr. Asquith, 1o whom he
owed such success as he had achiev­
ed, but he said no personal consider­
ation could deter him from opposing
this measure, which presented the su­
preme question of abandoning the
principle of voluntary service, one of
the traditions of Britain's freedom,
and substituting the Prussian meth­
ods of compulsory service.
Simon Opposes Measure.
"Don't, condemn your own young
men," concluded the former home
secretary, dramatically. "Don't pay
this compliment 1o Prussian militar­
ism. Don't surrender one of the real
heritages of the 'English people for
a mess of pottage."
The debate in the house will he
continued lomororrow and a test vote
on the fivst reading probably will be
reached by 10 o'clock tomorrow even­
ing.
The ho^i^e of lords was the scene of
another debate on conscription, harrt
ly less animated than that in the
house of commons, ds Earl Kitcl^n
er, secretary of war, urged the com­
parative necessity of strengthening
the army by the means now propos­
ed.
Lord Kitchener declared himself a
firm supporter, of the voluntary sys­
tem, and regarded the present mSas-i
ure as only a temporary deviation
from the established policy.
PEACE PARTY TO BE

PROMINENT EARGO
MAN IS MISSING
Fargo, N. D., Jan. 5.—Evidently
with his mind impaired in sone way
W. H. White, secretary of the Stone
Piano company, and one of the lead­
ing Mlasons of the city, has been
missing from the city since Sunday
afternoon and there is not the least
clue as to his whereabo uts.
Working quietly since it became
known that Mr. White was numbered
among the missing, prominent Ma­
sons of the city and relatives have
been exerting every effort to locate
him, but have failed and there are
no clues available that have given a
solution of what has within the last
couple of days become a deep mas­
tery. If alive, it is believed that
Mr. White is wandering around some
place with his mind, a blank as to
things of the past, apd his distracted
family can only wait and hope for
the best, while friends and brother
Masons are exerting every effort to
find some clue that would lead to the
location of the absent man.

EMBARGO ON MUNITIONS
Lodge Upholds Position of This
Country in Heated Discussion
With Others.
Washington, Jan. !5.—Bonds of re­
straint against public discussion of
international relations of the United
States incident to the European war
opened in the senate today and for
more than an hour the session was
enlivened by debate over the govern­
ment's neutrality policy, exports of
war munitions, and travel by Ameri­
ca^ citizens on belligerent owned
ships. The discussion was precipi­
tated when Senator Jones of Wash­
ington, P.epublican. read a newspaper
editorial urging American citizens to
keep off the belligerent ships and ad­
vising the president to move slowly
in the crisis, heeding the interests of
99,000,000 rather than that of a "thou­
sand reckless inconsiderate and un­
patriotic citizens, who insist on trav­
elling on belligerent ships."
Warm Discussion Started.
Senator Nelson of Minnesota, Re­
publican, thus aroused Senate O'Gor
man of New York, Democrat, by ask­
ing whether Senator Jones regarded
Consul McNeely unpatriotic because
he sailed for his post on the Persia.
The New York senator explained that
McNeely had declined to heed Consul
General Skinner's advice to sail on a
Dutch ship and blazed i.!\e way to gen­
eral debate on the position of the
United States in the war.
There was no /division of the de

Works Of Oartlfarhla, Republican, as
seited that the government of the
United States was "hypocritically"
claiming to be neutral when it was in
fact participating in the war through
the sale of munitions.
Talk of €r ibargo.
Senator Lodge, ranking Republican
member of the foreign relations com­
mittee, declared that to place an em­
bargo on arihs now would be worth
more to Germany than a million men.
that it would lie a "grossly unneutral
act' and would in fact make the Unit­
ed States the ally of Germany. Sena­
tor O'Gornian and Senator Hitchcock
of Nebraska, both Democrats, urged
the advisability of an embargo on mu­
nitions, asserting that the govern­
ment shared responsibility for deaths
of Americans on (he Lusitania. Sen
tor Works said:
"The government knew that the
Lusitania was loaded to the guards
with ammunition and explosives.
Passengers were permitted in spite ol"
this to travel on the vessel. The
government itself, in full knowledge
that the ship carried munitions of
war is primarily responsible for the
death of our citizens.
Upholds United States Position.
"It is impossible to get to Germany
and it is morally wrong to permit
shipment of arms to any of the bel­
ligerents," ^Senator Works added,
saying his principal objection was on
a conviction that the United States
was aiding in the prolonging of the
war and killing of men, and that he
would not only put an embargo on
shipment of munitions but also food
and clothing to Europe..

sition of the United States as to ship­
ment of munitions, engaged in a

Affections Were Stolen.
Sioux Falls, S. D., Jan. 5.—An ad
liourned term of United States court,
with Judge James R. Elliott presiding,
will convene in Sioux Falls tomorrow.
Among cases to be disposed of is
the new trial of the case of Clara T.
Armour of Cherokee, Iowa, against
Mabel E. McGowah, a widow of Mil
{ank. S. D., and the suit of F. I. Cum­
mins of this city, formerly general
manager of the South Dakota Central
Railway company, against President
Maytag of the railway company.
Judge Elliott granted a motion last
fall for a new trial in the Armour-Mc
Gowan case, declaring that, tn his
judgment, the verdict of 125,000
awarded the plaintiff by the jury
which heard the case at the first trial
was excessive. Mrs. Armour alleged
that the Milbank woman alienated the
affections of Mr. Armour, who is a
traveling man.
The suit of Cummins vs. Maytag is
for damages because of alleged slan­
derous statement1!, growing out of the
financial difficulties of the railroad
company, with which both men were
connected, and for which a receiver
was later appointed.
