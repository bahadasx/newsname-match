KAFIR, MILO MAIZE, AND FETE
RITA CLUBS
In addition to corn clubs, it
has been found to be wise to
organize other clubs. In west-,
em Oklahoma and Texas, where
corn is not adapted to the cli -
mate, it has been found advis-,
able to organize boys in kafir, j

One acre is the unit for these
clubs. -

Cotton is a standard crop in
the South and in any system of
diversified farming must occupy
an important place. Therefore

Bureau of Animal Industry there
have been organized pig, poultry

I Animal Industry has placed a

aeents of the Office of Extension

york) in the pig and poultry
work.
Other agricultural clubs may
be organized to serve the needs
of communities in which they
are iocated. It is thought best,
however, not to multiDlv clubs.
HOW BOYS' agricultural clubs
ARE ORGANIZED
Arrangements have been
made for active cooperation with
the extension divisions of the
agricultural culleges, and, where
local conditions will permit, with
State and county superinten
dents of education and others.
After enrollment of the club
t members a meeting or meetings
! of the boys interested should be
held, either at the courthouse or
at some central - place in the
county, for the purpose of in
struction and organization. Ef
forts will be made by the county
farm demanstration agent to get
in touch with every boy through
a system of group meetings for
the purpose of instruction. The
cooperation of the school author
ities is necessary for this pur
pose. Such meetings should be
held in ample time to give in
structions regarding the prepra
tion of soil, selection of seed,
fertilizers to be used, methods,
of planting, cultivating, harvest
ing, etc. It is estimated that a
series of these meetings for each
county, held at three different
times of the year, will be suffi
cient to give ample instructions
to the boys.
The best results are generally
obtained when the following
plans are followed in a county:
1. The local teacher organizes
the club and sends the names
and addresses of the boys to the
county agent of the farmers'
cooperative demonstration work.
In case there is no county agent
in the county, the teacher sends
jthe enrollment to the county
'. superintendent of education, di
rects the work in the county,
I holds county meetings, formu
lates the .county rules, and set
tles all county contests. He re
; ceives the names and addresses
j of the boys from the local teach
ers, makes copy of the same for
his office,', and sends copy of
names and addresres, arranged
alphabetically, to the county
superintendent of education and
to the State agent in charge of
boys agricultural clubs. When
there is no demonstration agent
in the county the county super
intendent sends names and ad
dresses to -the State agent in
charge of boys' agricultural
clubs. "

CLASSIFICATION OF CLUBS
t
It id important to classify the
club wiembership with reference
to the number of activities en
gaged in, as, for example, class
A, boys engaging in one activity;
class B, thoge engaging in two
lines of work; class C, those fol
lowing three lines; class D, those
following four lines, and so on.
