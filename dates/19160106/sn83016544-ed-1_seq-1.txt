Forest Fires Report.
In a report just submitted to the Dis­
trict Forester at Denver, Colorado, the
Supervisor of the Superior National
Forest reports that 21 tires were con­
trolled by the force of Rangers and
Forest Guards under his supervision,
during the past summer. Although
the summer was one of excessive mois­
ture there were periods of very dry wea­
ther when fire conditions became very
serious. The report shows that 13 fires
originated on National Forest lands, 4
on private lands within the forest boun­
daries, 1 which originated outside of
the forest boundary and entered the for­
est and three fires which originated out­
side and did not enter the forest-
The causes of the fires are classified
as follows:— Lightning 2, incendiary 2,
brush burning 3, campers 10, unknown
3 and miscellaneous 2.
These fires burned over a total of 161
acres of timbered land. The total cost
of fighting all fires amounled to $1330.20.
The increasing use of the National
Forest for recreation and other purpo­
ses has, says the Supervisor, increased
the fir6 hazard in like proportion.

The New Year.
Will the New Year bring peace
Peace in Europe will be the greatest
gift the new year can bring to the
world. The armies of the Allies and
Teutons have been locked in battle so
loDg that the world has become almost
callous. Every day we have read in the
news dispatches Accounts of horrible
fighting. Today forty thousand men
were wiped out. Yesterday whole bat
tilions were decimated. The day before
thousands of men wore caught in a trap
and killed. Reports state that Ger­
many's list of killed totals over
2,000,000. Beautiful cities and priceless
works of arts have been razed. Help­
less women and children have been dri­
ven by the enemy from their homes and
starved or thrown on the mercy of the
charitable. No longer are we affected
by the horror of these dispatches. Our
minds have refused to grasp the tre
mendousness of it nnd we read the war
news with hardly more of a thrill than
we get from a sensational murder. Re­
cent dispatches from Europe have em­
phasized the peace note. German so­
cialists, apparently, are demanding that
something be done to end the slaughter.
Austria likewise is ready for peace—in
all probability has been for some time.
It is not unlikely that France and Eng­
land, despite their assertions to the con­
trary, would be amenable if proper
terms could be obtained. The neutral
world is crying for peace. Will the New
Year bring it? Nineteen sixteen will
hold muoh for the United States in the
way of prosperity and progress. We
have reached a period of construction
whioh will begin this year. Many seri­
ous problems are before the people for
solution, and the tendency is to ignore
radicalism and to concentrate our ef­
forts and some poliicy. But of all the
gifts whioh the New Year may have in
store for us, the greatest would be'
peaoe in Europe,

GONSULABOARD
British Liner Persia Is Sunk in
the Mediterranean.
FEW ON SHIP ESCAPE DEATH
Report of Disaster Says Most of the
Passengers and Crew Went
Down With Vessel.
London, Jan. 3.—Three hundred and
ninety-two men, women and children,
including Robert N. McNeely, Ameri­
can consul at Aden, Arabia, were lost
when the British steamship Persia was
torpedoed in the Mediterranean Thurs­
day, according to unofficial advices
from Cairo.
One hundred and fifty-eight surviv­
ors have been landed at Alexandria,
Egypt. The survivors unite in say­
ing the vessel was torpedoed without
warning and sank in five minutes.
Out of eighty-seven women only
seventeen were saved. Apparently all
of the thirty children aboard were
drowned.
Charles H. Grant of Boston was
among the saved.
Retails of the sinking of the Persia
c^me in slowly, but such information
as was received made it appear that
the number of persons who escaped
in the four boats, which were put off,
was larger than was hoped when the
first news was received.
A Lloyd's dispatch gives the num­
ber of survivors landed at Alexandria
as 153, made up of fifty-nine passen­
gers, of whom seventeen are women
and ninety-ftfur members of the crew,
including fifty-nine lascars.
The survivors include ten military
officers and eight persons who are not
British subjects.
"The sljip was struck amidship on
perl gtdc at 1:16 p." in.," says In­
ter's correspondent at Cairo. "It had
disappeared completely by 1:15.
"Survivors say it was little short of
a miracle that any was saved. There
was no panic. Four boats were
launched with the utmost prompti­
tude.
"The captain was drowned. When
last seen he was swimming after the
liner had plunged beneath the sur
face."
MEETS AMERICAN DEMANDS
Reply of Austria to Second Note on
Ancona Sinking.
Washington, Jan. 3.—Austria's re­
ply to the Ancona note not only meets
the cardinal points of the American
demands, but gives assurances for the
future which are considered more sat­
isfactory in their extent than those
which were given by Germany.
The full American official view will
not be known until after President
Wilson has studied the Austrian re­
ply, which was received from Ambas­
sador Penfield and was immediately
dispatched to Hot Springs by a White
House messenger.
Austria in the Ancona case has sub­
scribed to the principle that no ships
will be sunk, unless they offer resist­
ance or flee, without the persons
aboard being brought to safety.
This is considered an assurance that
is farreaching and satisfactory.
RUSSIAN ARMIES ATTACKING
Vigorous Offensive Proceeds in Buko
wina and Bessarabia.
London, Jan. 3.—The Russians have
captured the heights northeast of
Czernowitz, Bukowina, according to a
dispatch to Reuter's Telegram com­
pany from Petrograd. Eight hundred
and seventy prisoners fell into the
hands of the Russians.
Russia's campaign in Bessarabia
continues to be the most important
visible war activity. From the Pri
pet to the Roumanian frontier, over a
front of at least 300 miles, a huge Rus­
sian force with a great appearance of
confidence is hurling sledgehammer
blows at the opposing force which, ac­
cording to all accounts, totals at least
one and a half millions of men.
LAY BLAST TO FOUL PLAY
General Opinion of British Regarding
Natal Explosion.
London, Jan. 3.—The loss of the
British armored cruiser Natal, sunk
by an explosion, generally is attribut­
ed to foul play. In support of this
theory attention is called to similar
disasters which overtook the British
battleship Bulwark, which was blown
up off Sheerness in November of last
year with the loss of 700 or more
men and the British steamship Prin­
cess Irene, blown up in Sheerness
harbor last May with a loss of between
300: and 400 lives.

provements on the church building.
Miss Lundquist returned Saturday
morning via Crescent from her vacation
trip at the "head of the lakes," and re
umed school work at Birch wood on
Monday.
The fishermen's basket social on the

fixing up the interior of their hall. The
lowest basket brought $2.00, and the
highest &7.60.
lhe annual meeting of the Farmers'
Fire Insurance Company will be held at
the Chicago Bay schoolhouse Tuesday

came down on Tuesday and gave a mov­
ing picture display at the town hall in
the evening. The program consisted of
"The Man From Nowhere," "The Bell
Ringerand "The OWring?" iwair
sized audience being in attendance.
L. N. Eliaseo shipped in a bit of ma­
chinery in the fall that is proving a
veritable "public benefactor" to the
community. It consisists of a 6-horse
power gasoline "Economy" engine and
wood-saw shipped from Chicago, the
two pieces of machinery being secured
to a dray, and can be easily moved from
place to place by one team and quickly
"set" for business. John Jacobson was
the first to profit by its use, and now a
number of others have followed H.
Greeley's advice and "looming up" their
wood-piles, using the "Economy" to ex­
pedite matters. It's a success, and no
mistake! Try it, and be convinced.
fiUv-.C No, 31
The January meeting of the Hovland
Advancement Club was held at Moose
Valley school house New Year's even­
ing, and was one that will long be re­
membered. Notwithstanding the "wea­
ther-man" had on the p/ogram the wild­
est snow-storm yet enjoyed this winter,
six team-loads of people representing a
territory more tban 25 miles in length,
including Colvill, the Poplar Hill, Flute
reed Valley, Chicago Bay, Bigbay and
Howards Bay, Hovland settlements and
the Birch wood settlement on the Reser­
vation, reached the rendezvous, while a
seventh load started but owing to the
fierceness of the storm returned home.
Others made the trip on snowshoes or
with skis the schoolhouse was filled an
interesting progaam—dramatic, musi
cial, recitations and readings, was given
refreshments were twice served, and an
all around good time was the resull.
Five new members were secured, and
many of the members of last year paid
their annual dues for 191G, thereby re­
ceiving a substantial sum to add to the
club's bank account. Owing to the ra­
pidly increasing membership and atten­
dance it was found necessary to order 4
dozen more Club buttons, and more
cups and plates, as well as aluminum
cooking utensils. The return trips thru
the drifts was full of interest, incidents
and excitement. The February raeeticg
is to be held at Chicago iy the first
Saturday in the month. Might 2s well
be out of the world as not a member of
the club.
