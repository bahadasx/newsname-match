BLUE BEARS BY ACCIDENT
Philadelphia Zoo Gets Rare Animal*
From Tibet—Only Ones In
America.
There arrived In New York Inst Feb
ruary the final shipments of large wild
animals, as the war has completely
paralyzed the trade, of which the Ger
mans controlled about 75 per cent. In
this shipment were several young
boars, which were sent over as Rus
sian brown bears, Lirsus arctos. Two
of these, a male and a female, were
acquired by the Philadelphia Zoolog
ical society. When they arrived at the
gardens it was at once noticed that ]
they were in many characteristics en
tirely different from any known va
riety of their supposed type, which
rarely shows variations. On the other
hand, they corresponded in every no
ticeable particular with the Tibetan j
blue bear described by Blyth.
As the animals were still very j
young, it was not possible at that time
to identify them, nor was it possible
to ascertain where they were cap
tured. Since they have been hero,
however, they have grown sufficiently
to determine beyond reasonable doubt
that they are Tibetan bears. Their
most striking characteristic is their
white-lipped, blackish hair, which |
gives their fur a hoary appearance |
and Imparts a light bluish tinge. This
Is never known to occur In any other
old world bears.
And so. by the merest chance, the
Philmlfdpl ia zoo made the most im
portant acquisition in years, and these
two blue bears from Tibet, Ursua
bruinosus. are the only specimens in
the Pnited States. As far as is known,
they are the only ones that have ever ]
reached an American collection. Their
habitat is Tibet, in the neighborhood
of Llasa.
An Old Philanthropy.
That there is such an institution as
“The General Society of Mechanics ;
and Tradesmen of the City of New j
York’’ will probably be news to the
majority of the people who read of
the bequest of $1,800,000 to it in the
Will of the late Amos F. Eno. Yet it
has been doing a good work in this
city ever since 1785, and this splen
did addition to its resources will bo
the means of extending activities long
shown by experience to meet real
needs. Us evening classes in draw
ing, modeling, architecture, industrial
electricity, etc., are attended by more
than 2,000 students; and it is said that
there is a waiting list of an equal
number. Such a bequest is a remind
er at once of the grand scale on
which charitable and educational
gilts are made in this country in our
time, and of the great number and
variety of institutions devoted to
beneficent objects, many of them sel
dom in the public eye, that are being
maintained by private endowment. —

Concrete vs. Salt Water.
A series of time tests to determine
the action of salt water upon different
grades of concrete has recently been
| completed in Boston. Five years ago,
24 concrete piers were sunk into the
waters of Charleston bay. These
piers were 16 feet long and as many
inches square in order that a largo
surface might be available for the
action of the salt water.
I.ast month they were taken up for
Inspection. One was practically in
perfect condition. One was almost
completely severed near the middle
by the erosion of the water, and oth
ers showed signs of disintegration.
Each specimen represented a different
formula for producing concrete. The
i result of this test will bo of practical
value in future construction of sea
walls, breakwaters and other concrete
j work exposed to suit water.
Foreboding.
George Ade is in great demand as

At a recent wedding breakfast in

j of a toast:
"1 have often been asked why I nev

ing once. The girl was beautiful, and
I sat down at my typewriter one night
{ to propose to her in a passionate love
poem. The first line of this poem end
ed with ‘cupid.’ I made a thorough
search, but 1 found that the only word
that rhymes with ‘cupid’ is ‘stupid.’
“Tills made me hesitate,” Mr. Ado
concluded, “and I’ve hesitated ever
since.”
A Pocket Periscope.

WAR-CRIES USED BY THE JEW
They Are Many and In All Tongues,
But Another One Is Said to
Be Coming.
“The Jew has as many war-cries as
there are tongues in Europe, for he
fights with them all; and then he has
his own war-cry, that eternal tearful
cry of his that in these days is rending
the heavens over Russian and Galician
Polands,” K. it. Lipsett writes in the
Century.
■And still there is another and a
newer cry coming, the war-cry of the
neutral Jew. To arms! to arms! O Is-
I ra*l! has arisen, the sudden thunder
ing cry throughout the length and
breadth of the New York Ghetto and
all the other Ghettos in the larger
cities of America.
“We know, of course, what are the
j arms of the Ghetto Jew; they are
j tongue and pen. By means of these
: It is Intended to raise the Jew from
the depths of his ashes and make him
a live nation again. A congress of
American Jews is to bo called and it
Is to demand, at the conclusion of the
war, or before it, the return of Pales
tine to its ancient owners. For the
Jews are a nation, and they must have
a land and Palestine is theirs.
“That Is to say, in brief, that while
i nearly three-quarters of a million Jews
on the European battlefields are at
one another’s throats, in vindication
each of a different nationality, the
Jews far away from the bursting shells
and glittering bayonets are calling out
to them: No, you arc all in the wrong.
For you are all one.’
“It is not for us to determine
whether the Jews are a nation. It is
not for one man to toll another what
he should lie. One is what one feels.
If the Jews feel themselves a nation
that ia sufficient.”
PIANIST BUILT A CLAVICHORD
Admiration for Bach Was Younj
Man’s Inspiration In Its
Construction.
A longing to hoar and to play the
music of Bach on the clavichord, the
instrument on which Bach played and
composed his music, led Frank M.
Watson, twenty-two years old, a Jack
son musician, to build one of these in
struments, and to Ipiild it under such
a handicap as would cause the aver
age person to despair, a Jackson cor
respondent of the Now York World
writes.
Two years ago Watson wont to Bos
ton and studied for a year at New Eng
land Conservatory of Music. There he
acquired a technical knowledge of tho
piano and kindred Instruments, which
enabled him to build a reproduction of
tho clavichord, an instrument which
has not boon used for 200 years, from
printed descriptions of it.
in the museum of the Cniversity of
Michigan there is a clavichord built in
the time of Bach, but knowledge of
tins instrument did not come to young
Watson until he had practically com
pleted the clavichord on which he was
working. However, he made a trip to
Ann Arbor, and not only inspected the
instrument at close range, but put It
In repair. With tho exception of one
or two tilings he found that the clavi
chord built by ins hands was correct,
and details which were wrong were oi
a minor nature.
Potaeh and Phosphates.
Tho agricultural department of the
University of Illinois has published an
other report dealing with the soils of
this state and the fertilizers which
they need. This new investigation,
like the last, shows that Illinois farm
ers need not worry about potash. With
the exception of swamp lands our soils
have all the potassium salts they need,
and the addition of more is a stimu
lant rather than a food.
What Illinois land usually does lack
is phosphorus, and the United States
has a plentiful supply of phosphate
rock. Tliis is good news to farmers
who had been taught that the luck of
German potash would cut down their
crops, if tends likewise to stimulate
an American industry which was be
ing hidden behind clever foreign ad
vertising. By the time this war is
over, America will know how much
poUisli fertilizer it really needs, and
what tho stuff is worth on the soil. —

Tenant Defense Leagues.
The workers’ war emergency com
mittee of Great Britain, in consid
eration of tho increase of house rents
throughout the country, are organiz
ing conferences to be held in all the
chief industrial centers within the
next few weeks with a view to form
ing tenant defense leagues. These
leagues are to organize the tenants
with tho object that they shall refuse
to pay the increased house rents dur
ing tho war. It has been indicated
that tho government would take ac
tion against the abusive demands of
landlords, but the workers’ war emer
gency committee will curry out their
present plans.
Dawn Near Armentieres.
One of the most poignant memories,
it may be, that I have brought back
from the war is the unearthly beauty
of the dawn In thut low country,
writes a British captain in the Atlan
tic Monthly. Morning after morning
I watched it, and tho wonder never
j ceased. Water, mirroring willows and
i the silvery sky, stood ever in the fore
ground; the low farm houses lay mys
terious; the battered church was
whole again. With the full light and
an awakened world the picture was
commonplace: In the half light and
the silence its beauty seemed the one

j “Could you lend me your steplad
i der? I want to take out some of the
j window screens.”
Tho man addressed, next-door nelgh
| bor, Robert Mason, nodded simply. He
1 was tho owner of tho house into which
| Earle Pelham and his wife had just
' moved. Pelham had paid a liberal rent
for the place. The unsocial manner of
his landlord displeased him. The lat
j ter simply lifted tho article asked for
over the low dividing fence, bowed and
turned away.
“Humph!” commented Pelham, al
most irritably, as ho entered the
house.
“What is tho matter, dear?” inquired
Mrs. Pelham, tracing displeasure In
his manner and voice.
“That landlord of ours. Asked him
Just now to loan mo a stepladder to
get at the screens and ho acted as if
be grudged even a decent word.”
“Oh, you misjudge him, Earle, In
deed you do!” Mrs. Pelham hastened
to say. “1 feel so sorry for him-all
the town does, 1 learn. His life is a
sad, sad history. A year ago his wife,
a bride of a year, had a fit of sickness
which led to a complete nervous break
down. She got so bad they had to
send her to a sanitarium. Two months
ago she escaped. They have not been
able to trace her since. It Is feared
that she wandered out among the
swamp lands beyond the sanitarium
and perished from hunger or was
drowned.”
“Poor fellow!” spoke Pelham, his
sympathetic heart deeply touched by
She Turned Toward the Intruders.
this recital. “I will be more charitable
In my judgments after this.”
Tho Pelhams had not dealt with Ma
son personally in renting the old home
of Mrs. Mason’s family, but through
' an agent. After the death of tho par
-1 ents of his wife, Mr. Mason had moved
into the old home. Now he was rent
ing It furnished and had taken up
more limited quarters in the adjoining
cottage, which he owned.
The Pelhams had just moved in.
Mrs. Pelham was busy all day long get
ting tho interior in order. Her hus
band attended to outside matters. He
removed the screens, tidied up the gar
den and both retired that night pretty
well wearied with their unusual labor.
“The house is too large for us,
Earle,” Mrs. Pelham remarked. “I
wish we had taken the one Mr. Mason
occupies.”
"1 don’t know that we could get it,"
observed her husband. “I heard he
was going to sell both places If he
could and leave tho town. The associ
ations of this old house, where bis un
fortunate wife was born, must be very
painful to him.”
Robert Mason had given up his wife
] as dead. In trying to locate her after
her escape from tho sanitarium the
I searchers had discovered several
clues that led them to believe that the
fugitive had wandered into the swamp
district. This was a dangerous and
interminable swamp spot, and three
days after the disappearance of Mrs.
Mason a fire had swept the greater
portion of it. There was every reason
to believe that Mrs. Mason had per
ished.
A distressing feature of her fate was j
tho fact that the physician in charge of
the sanitarium had entertained great
hopes of her eventual recovery. She
had been improving for some weeks
prior to her escape.
It was about midnight when Mr. Pel
ham, soundly asleep, was aroused
from his slumbers by a quick nudge
from his wife. Her voice was tremu
lous and agitated as she whispered
breathlessly:
"Get up at once, Earle!”
“Why. what is the matter?” In
qulred her better half drowsily.
“Burglars!” shuddered Mrs. Pelham
“Oh, do be careful! I’ve been ovei
half an hour lying awake and listening
to suspicious sounds.
“The w'nd, I suppose—”
“No, I thought so at first, but found
1 was mistaken,” continued Mrs. Pel
liatn in a timorous voice. “First 1
heard the front door rattle. Then
someone tried the side windows. Then
there was a window lifted in the gar
ret. Oh, I am sure someone is up
there! Now, Earle—do you not hear?”
"You’re right, Rachel,” assented Mr.
Pelham, after a moment of intense
listening.
There was no doubting the fact that
the floor overhead creaked as hurried
footsteps crossed it. Then there was
a scraping sound, as of someone pull
ing a trunk or box over the boards.
Then a breaking sound.
Mr. Pelham got out of bod, dressed,
and lighting a lamp got a revolver
from a bureau drawer. His wife fol
lowed his example by throwing on a
dress. She was close behind him us
they crept up the attic stairs.
"Oh, do bo careful!" she implored
whlspcrlngly, us they reached the top
of the stairs, and a low, vague coon
ing sound reached their hearing from
beyond the threshold of the attic
door.
"Hold the lamp.” directed her hus
band. "When I pull the door open
suddenly lift it so I can see where to
lire."
Mr. Pelham gave the door a quick
pull. With a trembling hand his wife
lifted and extended the lamp.
"Don't don't shoot!” almost
screamed Mrs. Pelham. “It's a girl—
a woman!”
The flickering lump fell across a
woman, singing softly to herself and
taking dress after dress from a trunk
she had opened. She turned toward
the intruders in a surprised way.
"Visitors," she observed in a soft,
plaintive tone. “You will have to ex
cuse me till I get ready to go down
and meet my guests. 1 have just ar- i
rived home. Some wicked people
stole mo from my husband and I
escaped—"
"Oh, Earle!" gasped Mrs. Pelham,
tugging at her husband’s sleeve,
"don’t you understand? ’ It's that poor
lady next door they mourn ns dead.
Oh, quick! quick! run for her hus
band. She has found home at last—
and see, that open window. She must
have reached it with the stepladder.”
Mr. Pelham, terribly excited, hurried
away. Mrs. Pelham advanced to the
1 side of the woman, whose garments
were nearly in rags.
"Pick out your dress, dear,” she
said soothingly. "Your husband will I
be here soon.”
“But—strangers In the house!" be- (
gan the oilier suspiciously.
"Oh, we are just guests,” assured ;
Mrs. Pelham. "You will find every- i
tiling in order below."
It was a great shock for Robert Ma
son when his neighbor advised him of
the strange arrival of the night. He i
ca’.raed himself as he realized the situ- j
ation. As ho entered the attic, with a )
a-ild cry of delight his wife ran into j
his arms.
"Oli Robert! those wicked men who j
stole me away from you—”
"Gone entirely out of our life, my |
darling," assured Mason. "Come to j
your own rooms and get ready to join !
our kind neighbors at a little lunch,” j
he proceeded, and made a sign to the
Pelhams, who retired.
Half an hour later Mr. Mason led his j
wife, neatly dressed and looking calm
and happy. Into the rooms below. The
quick-witted Mrs. Pelham had spread
out a small refection. To the letter
the program of "visitors” was carried
out, and in the eyes of the poor wan
derer all could trace a slow but euro
returning of reason.
“You will have to keep up the pre
tense of going over to the next house
till I can arrange otherwise,” whis
pered Mr. Mason to Mr. Pelham.
“Oh, you mustn't disturb your wife
with anything,” answered Mrs. Pel
ham. “And besides—we like the little
home best!”
Famously good people, the Pelhams
shared the glad, grateful Joy of their
landlord, as the days went on and Mrs.
Mason came back Into the full sun
shine of reason and health.
LUCK OF THE HORSESHOE
Popular Superstition Has Been Traced
to an English Demon of Thir
teenth Century.
Why Is the horseshoe considered a
sign of good luck? There is nothing
especially pretty about a horse's cast
off iron shoe, and no doubt not one
horseshoe believer in a million can
tell why he treasures it.
The origin of the superstition can
be traced back to the thirteenth cen
tury.
The monk Gervaise of Tilbury In- .
forms us that at that time there was
a kind of demon In England which i
appeared ns a horse rearing on Its j
hind legs and with sparkling eyes. |
Whenever this apparition was seen It I
was a sign that a conflagration would
soon break out.
Hence, as giving a kindly warning, ,
this mysterious horse was regarded as
! a friendly spirit, and the animal In
general was believed to boa benefi
cent mystic power.
A horse tooth carried In the pocket
prevented tooth ache; It was a sign
of good luck to find a horseshoe, and j
one was placed under the pillow of a
child to cure the colic, or nailed
against a building to prevent It catch
ing Are. This led to Its general adop
tion as a protective symbol.—Stray
Stories.
Dubious Praise.
“I stand on my lecord," said the can

JAPAN’S RULER A WRESTLER
Bested In the Art, So Popular In Hi*
Empire, by the Son of a Poor
Farmer.
The mil ado of Japan, whose sub
jects have been doing so much to
help the allies m the present war, is
a thorough soldier, and has a wonder
ful knowledge of military tactics and
history. When he was quite a boy
ho was induced by his father, the latu
emperor, to take a aeon interest in
the principles of national defense. Hs
was caught wrestling and was made to
try his prowess with young men in
the humblest walks of life.
On one occasion, ho was present
with his father at a big wrestling
tournament and took part in many ol
the matches. He threw all of his op
ponents until there stepped into the
ring a young farmer’s son of such a
burly build that it was evident that
tho future mikado would have a very
rough time of it. However, lie went
manfully to work, but was heavily
beaten, and had to confess that the
farmer’s son was victor.
After the match, the late emperor
sent for the umpire, and, pointing to
the farmer’s son who was feeling
rather uncomfortable at having beaten
his future sovereign, he said: “I wish
to speak with that young man.”
When the lad appeared before him,
the mikado remarked; “My son,
henceforth you will become one of
the companions of my own son, and
will live and study with him while he
remains at school, for later on, when
ho becomes emperor, he will need
many a man like you.”
Tho heir to the imperial throne of
Japan and the common farmer's hoy
became the greatest of friends, and
the present mikado possibly owes a
groat deal of his democratic spirit to
thut memorable wrestling bout.
JAPANESE AN ABLE ORATOR
Young Student Has Carried Off Two
Prizes Within a Remarkably
Short Time.
One of the most interesting fea
tures of the international students’
reunion held at San Francisco, Cal.,
last August was the oratorical contest
for a prize of SSO. offered by Director
j General John Barrett of the Pan-Amer-
I lean union, for the best oration on the
! subject of Pan-American relations.
The winner of the prize, Mr. Ren
' Hirao. is a senior in tho economic de
] partment of Stanford university,
| He was born in Hiogo prefecture,
I Japan, February 3, 1801. After flnish
\ ing his secondary education in Japan,
he came to the United States in 1907,
and entered the San Jose High school
j at Sun Jose, Cal.
In 1912 he entered the College of
j the Pacific, and the following year
j transferred to Stanford university.
In May, 1915, Mr. Hirao won the
first prize of SSO in an oratorical con
test on Japanese-American relations,
! hold under the auspices of the Jap
anese Association of American College
Graduates. The winning of two prizes
within a period of three months
stamps the brilliant young Japanese
as an orator and thinker of marked
ability.
Soldier Dies by Schedule.
News of tho death in the British

HARD CASH FROM JUNK PILE
Great Manufacturing Concern Turns
1 Its Waete Material Into Various
Valuable Commodities.
If the pork packers use all of tb*
pig but the squeal, the great manu
facturing industries are not far behind
In utilizing every ounce of matter
that comes into their bands. Tbs
works at Hawthorne, 111., of the West
i ern Electric company, for Instance,
| dispose of junk or waste material
every month as follows: Brass, 100
' tons; copper, 180 tons; German silver,
j 17tons; iron and steel, 89 tons;
solder shimmings, 4 tons; lead, 833
tons; paper, 7 tons.
Scraps of different metal are kept
■ separate and are baled by hydraulic
presses. Chips and sweepings are
passed through separators and mag
netic separators. These are melted
down or sold to refiners. Scraps of
celluloid are turned into enamel for
i Insulating iron wire cores. Sawdust
and chips of wood are sifted according
to size. The former finds its way to
I the plating and drying rooms, the lat
i ter to the furnaces, where it produces
| steam equivalent to the product of
5,200 tons of coal a year and wood
I asb that is sold for an average of
[ $C,140 a year.
I Waste paper and cotton waste ia
made into scratch pads or used in the
! packing department. Lead from
Junked cable Is melted off, refined and
used again or sold as pig lead. Cop
per wire la baled under pressure for
future use. Rubber is ground and
used In the manufacture of cast rub
ber parts.
As the company buys raw material
amounting to the average of $1,600,-
000 a month, the reclaiming of Junk Is
a most important item of expense
saving. And this is true of every
large factory.
HONOR GIVEN TO GOLDFIELD
According to United States Geological
Survey It Is Richer Than Ita
Rival, Tonopah.
The rivalry between Tonopah and
Goldfield mining campa seems to have
been definitely settled by the United
States geological survey. Figures glv
i en out recently indicate that Gold
field leads with a production of $66.-
000,000 worth of gold and silver, whila
Tonopah has little more than $60,-
000,000 to its credit. The state of
Nevada, however, can take credit for
$125,000,000 worth of gold and silver
from the two camps since 1900.
The Goldfield territory was opened
two years later than the Tonopah dis
trict. Considerable copper is even
yet being taken from the concentrates
j of the Goldfield mills, while the Tono
-1 pah fields are practically'abandoned.
The federal survey on the two fields
| reveals that while the deposits in each
were found in what is technically
known at tertiary volcanic rocks, in
form and character they were radical
ly different, thus disposing once and
for all of the old tradition that the
veins were the same, dipping far down
into the bowels of the earth between
the two camps.
"Juju,"
There has been nothing more pic
turesque in the reports of African war
fare than a sentence in the belated
account of the British defense of Tu
kum. which is Just Inside the border
of northern Nigeria; "The German of
ficers had repeatedly attempted to
take Tukum, but their native troops
refused again to face the juju at that
place." A worker among native race*
sends mo this word of explanation.
"It Is no wonder,” he says, "that the
Germans could not get their natives
to advance, as there is nothing they
are more terrified at than a juju,
which in this instance means that
some powerful witch doctor had laid
i a spell on the place, drawing a Mns
I round It which must not be crossed.
This line would be marked by places
| of tusk or hair or something of that
kind. The natives would be far mors
afraid of facing the juju than they
would be of death, because to do so
would raise up against them the spir
its of their ancestors."— Manchester
