of Week Long Struggle
(here Still Undecided
AUSTRIAN LINE IS WEAKENED
Russians Making Fierce Effort to
Break Through But Secret of
Movement Not Known.
London, Thursday, Jan. C. While
the battle on the borders of Bessara
bia is apparently far from a decision
each day finds the Russians claiming
the occupation of additional enemy
positions, and Putrograd believes that
it this progress continues a short time
longer a break somewhere in the
lines of the Central Powers must
come.
Tho whole energy of the Russian
Army is being directed to making a
gap between the German armies in
the center and the southern Austrian
forces, and the desperate Austrian at
tacks in the region of Kolki are de
signed to prevent this. The fighting
must continue for a considerable time
yet, but upon the result will depend in
large measure the strategy of both
sides when Spring comes.
While the fate of Czernowitz is ob
scured in conflicting reports, it ap
pears evident that the Russians domi
mile the Bukowina capital. Unofficial
dirpatches from Petrogiad slate that
the Austrians have evacuated the
town under pressure from the Rus
sians holding the heights above it,
while from Austrian sources tho in
formation has been received that the
Austrian troops have been withdrawn
from a portion of the city.
Czernowitz lies in a deep valley.
The town itself is not of great strate
gical . value, except for its railroads,
one of which, 'the itupo.'iant line to
Zale . Ktchitky, the Teutons have al
ready lost, while the line to Kolotnea
is seriously menaced. Hs fall, how
ever, is likely to have greater politi
cal than military significance.

The Karnak brought the survivors

sunk in the Mediterranean.
Berlin, Jan. 0. An official report
from Vienna today states that Czer

S. S. INSTITUTE
Meetings To Open at Baptist Church
Tonight
The stereopliron lecture "Up from
Childhood," delivered last evening
in the auditorium of the Baptist
church by Rev. C. A. Boyd, was u fit
ting preliminary to the Sunday school
Institute whose sessions open today
upon the arrival of the three other
Sunday school specialists. The lec
ture was an interesting and enlighten
ing exposition of the needs and tend
encies of the child from the earliest
stages of its development up through
the adolescent period, and the oppor
tunities open to the church for meet
ing those needs and directing those
tendencies. The pictures of the child
ren at play; happy in listening to a
story; or expressing their own ideas
through drawing, cutting and model
ling; the eagerness of older boys and
girls to do something, their age of
hero worship, their loyalty, to "the
gang" or "the crowd," their activities
as Boy Scouts or Camp Fire Girls,
aud through all these later stages
their consistent and proper demand
for. "something doiiin." were com-
mentarle:i in themselves. They wen
made the more forceful however by
the telling question, "What Is the
church going to do about it? Shall it.
blindly ignt.re these tf-isdenrles and
so lose its hold on the boy or girl at
the time when it should be' fit rouge st?
Or shall it utilize them, understand
ing nd directing them, so nioulliu;;
earnest Christian citizens?'' The lec
ture struck the keynote of the pur
pose of the sessions to be held in the
different churches during the next
thtee days.
This afternoon Milt on S. Littleiield,
Ph. 1)., D. 1).. a picture of whom, at
work with a group of boys was shown
on the screen last night, addressed
the high school. At the same time his
assistant, Miss Benedict, told stories
in the Congregational chapel to school
children from nine to fourteen vears
of age.
The first regular session of the in
stitute will bo held this evening at
7..1D in the Baptist church. Those
who have not already purchased tick
ets for the course may buy them nt
the doer. All tickets are fifty cents a
piece, whether for a single lecture, or
for the entire course.
Those attending Course 1, on "The
Child," conducted by Miss Benedict,

street. At. 7.30 Miss Benedict will
speak on The Program, at 8.15 give a
demonstration of the Bible Drill and
Correlated work. .Dr. Littiefield will
conduct his classes in the main S. S.
room, the entrance being the furthest
Valentine street door. At 7.30 he will
speak on The New Self, at 8.15 on tho
Material of Instruction. Arthur W.

London, Jan. 5. All direct advices
from Berlin have characterized the
illness of the German emperor as
slight and the only reports intimat

serious have come from Paris, Rome,
Copenhagen and similar places. None
of these have given definite sources
of information and in the most cases
as a matter of fact the statements
have been frankly given as merely
rumors.

Second Congregational church about

lage is in danger of desl ruction by
lire, George 11. llarwood, if he so de
sires, can turn over in bed and go to
sleep again but it will be the first
time he lias Krantr.il himself that privi
lege since 1S71. Kver since the vil
lage steamer was unloaded from the
car 44 years ago be has been its en
gineer and during that long period of
lime, with the exception of the few
occasion's on which he lias been out
of town, he has responded to every
ahum. Tuesday evening he present
ed his resignation to the board of
trustee? and while he must continue
to maintain an Interest In the depart
ment his official responsibility is at
an end. His is a long record and it is
doubtful if its equal can be found in
the records of any volunteer lire de
part men t in the state.
George II. llarwood became a mem
ber of the Bennington lire depart
ment in 1 ti 1 . shortly after returning
from the civil war. He has, therefore,
been a lireinun forever 51 years. To
the best of his recollection there is
living in Bennington today but oii'
member of the Siartati Engine com
pany No. 1, who v-:as ln the depart
ment when be answered his first
alarm. Henry W. Marsh now living on
School street. A half century ago the
old fashioned hand engines were
largely used by fire departments iti
towns the size of Bennington and
many of the companies became highly
efficient in the operation of this kind
of apparatus. Bennington at one
tiuie maintained by private subscrip
tion, a team which took a number
of prizes at the annual tournaments
and Mr. llarwood was an active mem
ber of this organization of star per
formers. Since 1871 his duties as a fireman
have been limited to the care and op
eration of the steamer. It has not
been necessary U use the engine
at a large number of fires for the
reason that the high pressure of the
gravity water system has been suffi
cient in most cases. It has, of course,
been impossible for anyone to know
at what minute the service of the
steamer might be required and tho en
gineer has always responded to the
alarms, day or night, and when ever
it has been necessary to use the auxil
iary apparatus it has reached the
scene of the fire in perfect, condition
with a good head of steam in the boil
er. Mr. llarwood was born tit North
Bennington. October 12, 1S43, the son
of James F. llarwood ami Roxaun
Olin. He learned tho maehfnists
trade at. the shops of the late Olin
Scott, on Pleasant street and has fol
lowed that occupation during Ills ac
tive life. Today, although he has pas
sed the limit of three score and ten,
ho is regularly employed at the shops
of the Charles Cooper Estate on Main
street. He married in Xt.7 Miss Caro
lina Walton. His sons both reside in
Bennington, Olin V who has been a
mail carrier for a number of years,
and G. Louis, who conducts a drug
store at the corner or North and Gage
streets.

DEPARTMENT
STARTING PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN
To Help Vermont Students Learn
About Vermont.
Conferences were held at tho State
House last week between Secretary of
State Guy W. Bailey, Walter 11. Croc
kett of the publicity department and
State Purchasing Agent Dewey T.
Hanley and between the first two
state officials and J. D. Whittier of
South Shaftsbury and K. L. Erwin of
Barton. The last named compose a
committee representing district
school superintendents and have
charge oi the work of assembling Ver
mont views. The publicity depart
ment Is co-operating with the commit
tee in obtaining pictures representing
typical rceiies and lantern slides of
scenic views, industries, etc. ,
Letters are to he sent to the CO
odd (superintendents in the state and
all will join in an effort to secure pic
tures to be used in schools for educa
tional purposes and outside the .state
for the publicity gained.
An effort is also to bemade to in
terest moving picture concerns in tak
ing pictures of Vermont's scenery, in
dustries and natural resources, such
as the granite and marble quarries.
The farm book has been revised to
date by Mr. Crockett and Purchasing
Agent Hanley was consulted about
the printing of the book, which will
be the third edition, there not hav
ing been an issue for over a year. The
new book will be illustrated, a feature
not contained in the previous issues
and will be considerably larger. It
has been decided not to have the
book Include a list of the farms for
sale, but to get out a separate pamph
let which will be cheaper and easier
to mail, and can be kept up to date.
There has been a great demand for
the farm book in tli last few months
and there are several thousand names
on the waiting list in the publicity de
partment's office. Interest in Ver
mont farms is growing rapidly and is
not confined to any one part of the
country, although many of the appli
cations for Information have come
from the West and Canada.
Another matter considered by the
publicity officials and Mr. Hanley was
the text book on the resources and
opportunities of Vermont, the publi
cation of which was authorized by
the last legislature. The book is
ready for the printer and the commis
sioner of education. Mason S. Stone,
has requested IO.IK'0 copies as the
minimum number required for use in
the schools throughout the state. The
book will be well illustrated and Is ex
pected to prove of much educational
yaluo to student", in the higher grades
and high schools.
The text book will not be distribut
ed aside from sending copies to
school superintendents although li
braries will be provided with copies
upon application as long as the sup
ply lusts.
An up-to-the-minute book contain
ing a list of and describing Vermont
hotels and boarding houses is being
prepared by the department and will
be issued during the winter to litre
the summer tourists to Vermont.
FIRE IN PITTSFIELD
Dlaze in Clothing Store Causes Loss
of $10,CC0
Pittslield. Jan. 0 Fire of unknown
origin in the Burns block, a three
story structure on the west, side of
North street between Summer and
Union streets, early last, night caused
d.imace estimated at $10,000. Fire
Chief W. C. Shepard said last night,
that the fire started in the clothing
store of Lou Sharlot. The police and
lire chiefs made a preliminary investi
gation last night, during which they
questioned three employes of Shar
lot's store, but made no arrests.
Mr. Sharlot and two employes. Ray
Williams and Arthur Yon said they
left, tlie store about t! o'clock. Wil
liams said he went back into the store
lor a minute to leave two umbrellas
which the men had picked up, think
ing that it was raining. Sharlot. and
two relatives had reached 'the Wend
ell hotel when the alarm sounded and
Williams and Yon were in a lunch
cart across the street. Sharlot, the
police say, said that, he carries ?ii500
insurance and a stock worth more
than that amount. Rice & Kelly furni
tore dealers, whose store adjoins
Sharlot's at the north and who also
occupy the two entire upper floors of
the block will have heavy smoke
damage to furniture and rugs. Shar
lot's stock will be a 75 per cent loss
it is estimated.
He Could Hardly Go.
"About two years ago I grtt down on
my back until I hardly could go,"
writes Solomon Dequeue, Flat River,
Mo. "I got a 50c box of Foley Kidney
Pills and they straightened me right
