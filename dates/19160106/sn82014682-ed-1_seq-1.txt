NEW YORK. N. Y. Jan, C It was

It is estimated that several thousand
people, mostly foreigners with chil

to get proper record made of these
births. t , , v ' v. . . . "'
"Because of the fact that the fedr
erar bureau of labor utterly refuses
to pay any attention to these terri
torial certificates,'- I abandoned th
plan of Issuing them," said Mr; Thayer
today, "and for a year and a half
have been endeavoring to bring about
some understanding with the depart
ment whereby the certificates would
have some value to holders upon going
from here to the mainland."
So far Thayer has received no word
that any more consideration' will be
given the certificates In the future
than in the past, except a letter from
the secretary of the interior saying
that the Jabor department Is giving
the request consideration. ?
"Feeling that the territory could not
wait longer in the matter, I have gone
ahead and decided to resume the cer
tificate plan," says Mr. Thayer, "but
have changed it considerably from the
old system.
"One of the changes is to allow a
renewal of certificates every five years
if so desired by the holder. This Is to
allow for the taking of new photo-.
graphs of the holder." .
Renew al .will not be required of per
sons, it will be allowed them as a
privilege, though a fee of $5 will be
charged for each renewed certificate.
The secretary of the territory is given
authority to make the issue by a ter
ritorial statute. t

To Repair ftM'ffllfc
Associated Press Service by Federal WirelessJ '
WASHINGTON, D. C Jan. 6. Estimates for appropriations submitted
. to Congress today disclose the fact that the navy department proposes to
spend $205,000 each in remodelling submarine F-f, f-2 and F-3.
These three submarines were badly damaged while lying in the slip
here by the U.S. S. Supply, which rammed the group In making berth sev
eral months ago. When the vessels were ordered out of commission and
sent to San Francisco for repairs at Mare Island, a local prediction w as
made tuat the submarines would be permanently retired, faults common to
the F group having been found during the investigation of, the F-4 disaster.
The statements to the Star-Bulletin of Ueut, K. B. Crittenden, command
ing the flotilla, that the submarines would be repaired and sent back into
service now turn out to be correct, according to the navy department's
" plans,. V :.: , ; ; V .:

BE KEPT ON JOB;
"Leading" Question," He Says
When Asked About Rumor of,
; Commissioner's Dismissal
. Is Joshua p.. Tucker, territorial
commisBioner of public lands, "to be
discharged from office before his
term expires on March 3? A ' persist
ent rumor of such action on the gov
ernor's part was afloat at the Capitol
today, but could not be verified.'
"That is a leading question," was
the governor's response when asked
as to the truth of the report," and I
decline to answer leading questions."
The governor added that the smart
est lawyer in the United States had
once tried to get him to answer a
leading question, but had failed.
Tucker's term expires on March 3,
and it is not the belief of territorial
employes in the Capitol that he will
be discharged before that time. They
think that he will be kept in office
for another term by the governor, and
scout the idea of any dismissal.
Commissioner Tucker has not been
in the best of health for some time,
but it Is not believed that he has ten
dered his resignation on account of
this. :. . : . ".'..:.-.'.....
Tucker is said to have a great many
warm friends among the higher-ups
who will fight against any effort made
to dismiss him from office.
