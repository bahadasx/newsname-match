FORMER INMATE OF WASHING
TON STATE REFORMATORY
ENDS OWN CAREER
HALF OF HART FAMILY
KILLED, FATHER ABSENT
Farm West of Raj' Scene of One
of Most Appalling Crimes
On Record
A triple murder and suicide, crimes
almost without parallel in local his
tory, marked the close of the old year.
The Place
The A. M. Hart farm home, about
three miles west of Ray, on the north
side of the main road between Ray
and Williston, just west of the Gun
derson farm.
The Time
Thursday,. December 30, probably
between the hours of three and six
p. m.
The Victims
Mrs. A. M. Hart, aged 45, probably
third victim.
Roy Hart, aged 13, probably first
victim.
Vahn Hart, aged 9, probably sec
ond victim.
The Murderer and Suicide
Guy Hall, alias Bruce Parkinson,
aged 21, identified as former inmate
of Washington state reformatory,
who had been employed on the Hart
farm about a month to do charos dur
ing the absence of Mr. Hart in Iowa
where he was called by the pro
tracted illness of his moth^^xlall
had worked about Ray since last July.
He was of rather good appearance,
it is said, and until the day of the
crimes had exhibited neither criminal
nor insane tendencies but was at
times addicted to drink. His right
name was Guy Hall and he was iden
tified through Washington relative?
and officials by general description
and tatoo marks on his arm.
Motive Theories
Hall had been selling small quan
tities of grain from the Hart farm
without authority and appropriating
the money. Discovery of this by the
Hart boys may have led their murder
followed by the murder of the mother
when she started to the barn in
answer to outcries.
Hall had been keeping1 company
with the Hart daughters, Violet and
Doris, aged 17 and 15, and on account
of his drinking habits his attentions
were objected to by the mother. A
quarrel over this matter may have
thrown Hall into a muredrous rage.
Hall had been drinking heavily the
day of the murders and this alone
may have been responsible. Some be
lieve he may have had a wild plan
for disposing of the others and
abducting one of the girls.
Iron Bar the Weapon
The morning of Thursday, Decem
ber 30, Hall took Violet and Doris
Hart to Ray where they wished to
spend the day with their aunt, Mrs.
Addie McFarland, after which he re
turned to the farm. From movements
observed by neighbors it is thought
the three victims were slain during
the latter* part of the afternoon.
An iron rod, sometimes known as
a carpenter's pinch bar. was the in
strument of death. The nature of the
wounds and blood on the bar, which
was found near the body of Mrs. Hart,
is ample proof of this. The weapon
is about two and a half feet long and
three-fourths of an inch in diameter
with one end bent around like the let
ter J, the curved, end being fashioned
into a claw to draw spikes and pry
apart boards. The. curved end was
the one used in striking down the vic
tims. The boys appeared to have been
struck from behind.
The little boys bodies were secreted
in a straw stack $ome distance from
the farm buildings and it is possible
that they were killed at the straw
stack. Blood marks indicated that
Mrs. Hart was struck down in the
door yard. Her body had been drag
ged into the house. Roy Hart is be
lieved to have been the first killed as
he received a single, but heavy blow.
The heads of Vahn and his mother
were beaten in by numerous blows.
Mrs. Hart had a blackened bruise
on her forearm where she had receiv
ed a heavy blow in trying to protect
herself. Her body bore, no evidence of
having been'violated.
Brings the Girls. Home
Soon after suppertime Hall drove
to Ray taking a small load of flax
which he sold, using part of the mon
ey to purchase a 32 caliber revolver
and two boxes of cartridges. Going

WILLISTON, WILLIAMS COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1916.
FIRES MARK FIRST
DAYS OF NEW YEAR
CLOTHING STOCK OF "THE HUB'
DESTROYED SUNDAY NIGHT
—SMALLER BLAZES
Low temperature, extra heat re
quired, defective chimneys. That is
just about the whole story of three
fires in the first five days of 1916.
Late Sunday evening fire was dis
civered in J. D. Wolpert's clothing
store, "The Hub,'' on Main street be
tween Second and Broadway. The
store was of course closed and the cur
tains drawn so that the fire was not
observed until it had gained consider
able headway and smoke was forcing
its way out. The building is heated
by a furnace connected with an ordin
ary brick chimney near the middle of
the north wall. In some way fira
reached the woodwork of the wall and
found its way to the attic between the
ceiling and the roof. The furnace
door was found open as though from
an explosion of coal gas.
The fire department was able to
save the building but the stock was
either burned or water soaked so that
Mr. Wolpert regards it as a com
plete loss. The stock was valued at
$12,000. and was insured for $9,000.
Roast Chicken
Late Tuesday evening the firemen
were called to west First street where
a small log building used as a chickeii
house was blazing. The walls were
saved but the 46 inmates were cre
mated causing quite a loss to the
owners, Mr. and Mrs. Holmes of the
"Farmers' Club" lodging house. The
cause of the fire is not known but ad
the building is only a few feet from
the wholesale spur it is believed that
a spark from a switch engine may
have been the cause.
Another Chimney Fire
Wednesday afternoon an alarm
came from Geo. W. Newton's lodging
house, The Brunswick, on south Main.
The wood work around the chimney in
the office had ignited. The firemen
were prompt and no water was need
ed, the blaze being extinguished with
the chemical.
Yale Comes West
For Winning Coach
New Haven, Conn., Jan. 3.—That
the choice of the new head of the
football coaching staff at Yale has
been shifted from Tad Jones, until
now most seriously considered as the
favorite, to Dr. Harry L. Williams of
Minnesota, and that soon after the
holidays an announcement will be
made that Dr. Williams is to be the
man, became known here Saturday.
Dr. Williams has been in New
Haven also during the Christmas holi
days, having come East from the
University of Minnesota, principally
to attend various conferences concern
ing college athletic matters in New
York City, but also to talk over the
Yale football situation with Mr. Mc
Cormick, Mr. Thorne and Mr. Kil
patrick.
The selection of Dr. Williams is all
but settled. No terms have been
agreed upon, and before the contracts
are finally made, the committee will
consider some other recommendations,
but long before the spring football
work is commenced, the announce
ment as to next fall will be made.

A. E. LOWE PASSES PKTRICT COURT
SICKNESS BRIEF
WOUND CONSIDERED TRIVIAL
PROVES FATAL—REMAINS
TO FOREST RIVER
With the closing hours of 1915 A.
E. Lowe succumbed to a brief but
severe illness at the home on Third
ave. east. Although his illness was
known to be dangerous, death came so
close after the the first intelligence
of his sickness that the community
was greatly shocked.
Only a few days before he was on
the street and attending to his grain
business. A small eruption had come
on the side of his head and this he
opened with a knife, intended for use
as a corn parer, that had been given
him at Christmas. The simple act
proved fatal for infection set in and
resulted in a stubborn case of blood
poisoning. Complications became
much worse when a severe cold de
veloped into pneumonia and the com
bine skill of several physicians in con
sultation was powerless. Death en
sued about 10:30 Friday evening, De
cember 31.
Funeral services were held Sunday
at 9 a. m. at the M. E. church, the
honr being set so the remains could
be taken on train No. 4 to Forest
River, N. D., the former home of the
deceased. The church was filled to
the doors with sorrowing friends and
the bier was heaped with floral
tributes. Rev. H. Styles Harriss
preached an eloquent and fitting ser
mon. The music was by a large
S5!I3 J° uorjwflaiap aSjei uioip
which order Mr. Lowe belonged, at
tended in a body. A large number ac
companied the remains to the sta
tion, the pall bearers being: U. L.
Burdick, S. M. Hdyle, A. L. Butler,
Paul Leonhardy, C. D. Milloy and
Malcomb Mackay.
The body was accompanied to For
est River, about 30 miles from Grand
Forks, by the wife, the two daughters
8?H a brother.
Allen Edgard Lowe was born at
Pakenham, Ont., June 16, 1872. Age
at death 43 years, 6 months and 15
days. His parents were John and Ann
Lowe. He came to Forest River, N.
D., in 1882 and grew to manhood
there, afterward living in Minneapo
lis, Alaska and the last ten years at
Williston. The father died in 1910,
the mother is still living at the age
of 83.
Left to mourn his loss besides the
mother, are the wife two daughters,
Beatrice and Viola, both in their
teens one sister, Mrs. E. J. Smith of
Brigsdale, Col. three brothers, H. R.
Lowe of Forest River, Harry Lowe of
Vancouver, and J. S. Lowe of Massey,
Ontario.
"Ed" Lowe, as he was best known,
was the type of man who makes and
holds friends. The human element was
the dominant one, he was known and
loved as a man with a big heart. Suc
cessful but always fair in business,
kind and thoughtful in his home, a
'generous and a faithful friend, he was
the manner of man that can ill be
spared.

WELLJJNDERWAY
"WET" DEFENDANTS HOLD CEN
TER OF STAGE FOR THE PRES
ENT—SOME CASES
The December term of district
court resumed work Tuesday follow
ing the holiday vacation and the
criminal calendar is in the hopper.
The first case was that of the state
versus J. P. Mitchell, colored, charg
ed with selling liquor. It took the jury
only about ten minutes to find him
guilty and he drew six months in jail
and costs.
The second case was that of Tim
Latham, bearing similar title. After
long deliberation the jury decided the
evidence was not sufficient to convict.
The evidence against Chris Bolstad
was so strong that he pleaded guilty
and drew the usual penalty.
Cases Not On Calendar
The sheriff, states attorney and
clerk came from Mountrail county
bringing Bert Nofsinger and Pete
Drouthe who pleaded guilty to the
charge of bootlegging and were sen
tenced by Judge Fisk to six months
each at Bismarck.
A raid by Sheriff Erickson and
Deputy Strom on a place in Whee
lock, frequently suspected of allow
ing gambling, was so successful that
E. J. Asselin and Knut S. Willand,
were brought before the court enter
ed a plea of guilty and had nothing
to say why sentence should not be
passed. So the court said 30 days, $25.
and costs, failure to pay fine and costs
to bring a fruther stay in the Hotel
Erickson.
A WATER USERS' CONFERENCE
By a letter received from Mr. I. D.
O'Donnell, Supervisor of Irrigation,
the project office of the Reclamation
Service is advised of a Conference to
consider operation and maintenance
matters. The conference will be held
at Bozeman, Montana, January 28 and
29, which are the last two days of
farmers' week at the Montana Agri
cultural College which ,is located at
Bozeman.
The water users' association is in
vited to send representatives, and to
suggest subjects to be discussed. As
the Williston Project is now on a
more satisfactory basis, and there
seems reasonable hope for its opera
tion this season, this would be an ex
cellent oportunity for local water
users to confer with the water users
from other projects in a section de
voted to irrigation farming, also to
bring up for discussion subjects and
problems with which the farmers on
the Williston Project have to contend.
Market Days Will
Be Made Permanent
A farm club meeting held at the
farm home of M. S. Phillips Tuesday
was attended by representatives of
numerous clubs, the principal busi
ness of the meeting being to consider
plans for future market days such as
were recently tried in Williston.
The two experiments already made
in selling farm produce direct to con
sumers were considered to have been
so successful that a continuation of
the plan was decided on. Union
farm club market days will be held
each alternate Saturday beginning
January 15. The Stroud building, on
West Broadway, Williston, until re
cently occupied by the Farmers'
creamery, will be the place.
This will be the arrangement until
further notice and all farmers' clubs
are invited to bring their produce and
join in. A display advertisement will
be found in this issue.

SINKING OF PASSENGER SHIP
PERSIA RECALLS PRESIDENT
FROM HONEYMOON
Washington, Jan. 3.—After Secre
tary Tumulty had telephone to Presi
dent Wilson at Hot Springs, it was
said at the White House that the pres
ident was preparing to return prob
ably tomorrow to take charge of the
international situation.
It was stated authoritatively that
the destruction of the Persia with the
loss of American lives, and the de
struction of the British ship Glengyle
had put such a grave aspect on the
relations of the United States with
the Teutonic powers that the presi
dent considered it necessary to return
to the White House immediately for
conferences with Secretary Lansing
and other members of the cabinet to
shape the course of the government.
The situation as it exists is describ
ed in official quarters as paralleling
the crisis which, was caused by the
sinking of the Arabic close to Ger
many's assurance in response to the
representations of the United States
on the destruction of the Lusitania.
Lansing also said that some action
would be take nto formally notify
Turkey and Bulgaria of the attitude
of the United States toward sub
marine warfare, so that all the central
power belligerents might not be uni
formed.
During the morning Baron Zwied
inek, charge of the Austrian embassy,
called on Secretary Lansing, asked*
that judgment be withheld until alii
facts are known, and expressed his
belief that the final explanation woulcf
be satisfactory. He also sought
available information for his govern
ment.
Baron Zwiedinek, also assured Lans
ing that if it was proved that an Aus
trian submarine had sunk the Persia,
his government would give full repara
tion and satisfaction. Lansing an
nounced he had instructed Ambassa
dor-Pen field at Vienna to ask the Aus
trian government for any information
which might establish the nationality
of the submarine which is said to have
sunk the Persia and which would de
velop the facts in the case.
While American officials are keep
ing their minds open until they have
all the facts in the Persia case offi

were endangered in the sinking of the

is not minimized, and the declaration

Oldest Riverman
Dies At Bismnrck
Captain Grant Marsh, active in
Missouri navigation for over sixty
years has started on his last voyage.
Back in the sixties and seventies,
when river traffic was important, his
name was heard as often, in Sioux
City, Yankton and other river towns,
as that of Jim Hill in North Dakota
today.
Last summer Captain Marsh paid
his last visit to Williston to assist in
piloting the boats down river. Stand
ing on one of the decks just before
the departure he talked of his early
life on the river and voyages to the
head waters of the Missouri gfty
years ago. At that time he said the
river at this point was nearly three
miles east of its present channel,
under the bluffs. He said the river
business was gone never to return un
less the development of the coal and
clay industries along its banks should
prove water transportation advan
tageous. The captain predicted that
Williston would become a large city.
He said that it had the location and
was sure to be one of the three first
cities of the state. The news item,
dated at Bismarck, January 3, telling
of the captain's death says:
"Grant Marsh, aged 83, the oldest
steamboat captain in actual service in
the United States, died in a local hos
pital in this city last night. Marsh
ran a steamboat on the M'sson™ in
the fifties and was un in the Yellow
stone river at the mouth of the Little
Big Horn at the time of the Custer
massacre. Curley, an Indian scout
brought him news of the battle and
wa sfollowed by carriers of wounded
to his boat.
Marsh made a famous run breaking
all records to Bismarck and brought
news of the massacre to the world.
He will be buried on a high bluff over
looking the Missouri river near old
Fort Lincoln, and scenes of Custer's
activities."
