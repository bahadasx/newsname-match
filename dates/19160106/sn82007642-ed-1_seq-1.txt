Blowing Rock Breezes
Despite the rough weather on
Christmas Day a congregation,
small but earnest, assembled in
the Reading Room to celebrate
the birthday of the greatest man
who ever lived on eartn, the ser-
vices a more appropriate way of
showing one's appreciation of
what that Man did for the world
than by meaningless racket-uiak-
ing or the idiotic filling of one's
stomach aud brain with "booze,
otherwise enlivening but not en-
lightening "fire-water."
On Christmas afternoon, thru
the rough weather, over a fearful
mountain road, Rev. Ldgar Tufts
made the 20 miles from Banner
Elk, stopping that night at Mr
E. G.Uuderdown's hospital Home
on the Cone Estate where Mr.
Underdown enjoys the honor of
bding the trusted manager of that
great estate, and next morning
Brother Tufts whirled into town No festival on the Christian cal

nothing daunted, the brave mes-
senger of the Prince of Peace held
two services that day, preaching
both times, to the morning con-
gregation giving a well thought
out and impressive sermon on the
Life of Christ, taking for his text
the words of the prophet Isaiah,
chapter 9, verse G, "He shall be
called wonderful," preaching an
excellent sermon on ''Cast thy
bread upon the waters: for thou
shalt find it after many days;
Mr. Tufts remaining over to per-
form the marriage ceremony in
the Presbyterian church on Tues-
day when Miss Elise Weedon was
given in marriage to Mr. Dalton
Kennedy of Statesville, an ac-
count of which important social
event will appear in next week'B

fact that in no community can
there be more up-to-date, faithful
and efficient practioners than in
thia little townnn t.hefilneRi1rp.

corresnondent voices the centi.

Among the young people re.
turning for the holidays were Miss
Eunice Holshouser, Miss Dorothy
Sudderth and Mr. Caskie Hodge.
Quite a number of guests, in
attendance on the Kennedy-Wee
don nuptials, stopped at the Wa
tauga Inn, that ever more and
more popular hostelry among
the snow-covered hills of old Wa
tauga.
Miss Mary Ward, among our
most popular young ladies, re
cently made quite an extended
trip to Caldweli county where she
visited friends and relatives, Miss

Ashevllle Citizen
Another Christmas finds the
United States at peace with all
the world, despite the fact that
dark cloudsarehourlygathering,
and the observance of the Natal
uny this year gives every prom
ke of being the most prosperous
in any year. Christmas willcome
with a new meaning to the thou-
Hands of deserving souls, and the
spirit of charity is abroad in the
land to a greater degree than
ever before. Some, of course, will
be forgotten, as they are always
forgotten, but in the main the
poor in this country are goingto
know the best, Christmas that
has ever befallen them. What
the next feast of the Nativity will
bring to America no man can tell,
but we should enjoy the preseut

ty has been pleased to bestow.
observance as does Christmas,
and it is one of the hopeful signs
for the future of the race that all
mankind, regardless of rank or
station, on this day finds time to
pause in its ceaseless struggle for
existence to give praise and
thanks to the Infant Savior. The
birth of man's Redeemer is the
one fundamental principle of the
Christian faith which has with
stood the fierce antagonism of
agnostics and unbelievers. Many
have doubted His crucifixion aud
subsequent resurrection, but none
has attempted to deny His birth.
So as the centuries have come
and gone the Christ of the Ages
has become more and more the
object of universal adoration
four thousand years it had been
one stupendous march from Eden
to Calvary, and the human race
has spent nearly two thousand
years in its journeyings from the
Cross back to Eden. Humanity
comes again to that blessed view
of all that the Child means to it;
generations may come and go,
but the Cradle at Bethlehem will
never cease to be.- Around this
Cradle earth's song and story
have lingered until His name is
on every tongue and in His pre&
ence the weary wait for eternal
rest

"Adequa'.i" Preparedness
Charlotte Observer.
The preparedness program hai?
been invested with new and extra
ordinary interest the past few
days by reason of the injection oi
charges of suppression of the re
port of the General Board of the
Navy by Secretary Daniels. Thk
report had gone more than the
length of the rope in asking foi
an appropriation that woulo
have approximated $1,000,000,
000 in six years to the end thai
the United States might have a
Navy the equal of the most pow
erful of any Nation in the world.
A report of this kind was regard
ed as impossible of acceptance
and the Secretary of the Nav,
very properly laid it aside. Ii.
both houses of Congress there
will be leaders advocating the ex
treme plans ol the Naval General
Board. Representative Gardnei
is heading this faction. Then
has also come to the support ol
the General Board the Aero Club
of America, which, through Mr.
Alan R. Ilawley, charges that the
action of Secretary Daniels in
side-tracking the report, "was o
compromise with such members
of the Democratic party who,
like William J. Bryan, Congress
man Claude Litchen and W. W.
Bailey, advocate limited arma
raent." Charging the Secretary
with playing politics, the Aerc
Club, itself, is giving the country
an excellent manifestion ofaplaj
of politics. The Observer believer
that Representative Padgett oi
Tennessee, who is chairman oi
the House Committee on Naval
Affairs, entertains the safe and
sound idea of what the Democrats
should do. He thinks the plan?
of the President as outlined by
the Secretary of the Navy, "an'
great enough to keep the United
States abreast of other maritime
Nations." The best thing Con
gress can do in the matter of leg
islating for preparedness is to
follow the President. ThepeopU
of the country would not go to
ex tremes in either d i rection . They
want Congress to keep in the mid
dle of the road and give the coun
try adequate preparedness-
nothing more and nothing less.
Enemies of Insurance
State Board of Health Bulletin
Tuberculosis, typhoid fever and
alcohol are considered the arch
enemies of insurance companies
according to Dr. J. L. Davis of
Texas. "Tuberculosis is realized
by insurance companies as ex
ceedingly infectious, and for many
years they have made careful In
quiries into the lives of appli
cants for insurance along this
ine. They go so far as to a seer-
tain whether the applicant has
receiiuy associated witn xuDercu
ous people. Tuey advocate
among their policy holders all the
modern means of preventing this
disease."
As to typhoid fever, which prob
ably they dread most on account
of its suilden attack and the high
death rate that is incident to this
disease, they advocate not only
anti-typnoia vaccination as a
preventive but insist on strict
sanitary living conditions for all
tneir policy Holders, iney are
opposed to paying premiums on
flies, filth and fever.
It was the insurance companies
that changed the alcoholic ques
tion from one altogether moral
to one to include pabhc health.
So great is the influence of alco
hoi on the mortality rate, that
insurance companies have be
come interested in it from a bus
iness point of view. Their statis
tics compiled forover twenty-five
years show that not only the
constant drinking man's mortal
ity rate is much n'gher but that
even the moderate drinker has a
rate equivalent to a reduction of
four years in the average life.
Tuskegee's New Head
Raleigh News and Observer
Described as a negro of great
tadt, an exceptional speaker, and
a safe, natural leader of the Ne
rro race, Robert Russa Moton,
for the past twenty-five years
ommandantof cadets at Hamp
ton Institute, chosen to succeed
the late Booker T. Washington
is the head of Tuskegee Institute,
orues to a position in which he
must needs be a factor m the
lives of the people of his race in
the South. What he has done at
Hampton Institute, what is said
jf him by those who know of his
life and his aims, are such as to
warrant the belief that a wise
hoice has been made in selecting
ain to go on with the work of
Booker Washington, the an
nouncement made by the trustees
being that "the policies, aims and
attitude of the Institute will con
tinue unchanged."
Major Moton is a Negro of un-
nixed blood and was born free,
.lis claim being of descent from
the chief of an African tribe whose
son had been taken unawares and
brought to this country about
1735 in a slave-ship with mem
bers of a rival tribe captured by
his father. Moton was born free,
in 1867, in Amelia county ,Va.,
ind in his early days was a work-
sr in the home on the Vaughan
estate in Priuce Edward county,
vhere it is said he copied the lan
juage, walk and dress of the son
of the house, being encouraged in
his efforts for an education. In
L885 he entered Hampton Instl
tute, first being assigned to work
in the saw-mill where he learned
to fire the huge boilers and to
run a Corliss engine, under the
lirection of an ex-Confederate
officer.
In the days of his schooling at
Hampton Institute he grasped
the spirit of that institution,
promptness, alertness, self-con
trol, endurance, respect for au
thority, initiative, good will, said
to be gifts of that institution to
him. As commandant of cadets
there he learned the value of
moral and industrial training as
leading to character and conipe.
tency, and without doubt he will
emphasize at Tuskegee these
things, doing work for the mak
ing of better schools, better
homes, better health, better farms

pears to be an omen of good for
Tnskegee and his race.

In 1862 a committee of citizens
called at the White House to ex
press its dissatisfaction with Pres
ident Lincoln's conduct of . the
war. After listening patiently to
the complaints of the delegation,
President Lincoln said:
"Gentlemen, suppose all the
property you were worth was in
gold, and you had put it in the
hands of Blond in to carry across
the Niagara river on a rope.
Would you shake, the cable, or
keep shouting after him: 'Blon-
din, stoop a little more go a lit
tle faster lean a little more to
the north lean a little more to
the south?' No; you would hold
your breath as wen as your
tongue, and keep your hands off
until he was safe over. The gov
ernment is carrying an enormous
weight. Untold treasures are in
their hands. They are doing the
best they aan. Keep silence and
we will get you safe over."
President Wilson could well an
swer his critics in the words of
President Lincoln. Most of the
criticism of the Wilson adminis
tration resembles the criticism of
the Lincoln 'administration in
that it is small and partisan and
aimless. It resembles the criti
cism of the Lincoln administra
tion, too, in that most of it comes
from second and third rate men
and newspapers.
Practically nobody who rails
against the President has a poli
cy of his own to present Even
the most rabid of the critics is
afraid to come out and frankly
declare for war. Back of most of
the assaults is a petty and child
ish desire to find fault for the sake
of finding fault.
Whether the President has
made mistakes in handling the
foreign affairs of the United
States we do not know, nor can
anybody know at this time. He
lias succeeded thus far in keeping
us out of war without surrender
ing any of our rights under inter
national law. Whether his policy
works out well or ill can be deter
mined only by its ultimate re
sults in the light of history. But
one thing is certain: There is no
record of a serious blunder on the
part of any President of the Unit
ed States who combined patience
with high principle.
