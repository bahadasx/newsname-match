LONDON, Jan. 6.—Labor leaders
•truck a heavy blow against conscrip
tion today. A resolution protesting
"In the name of 3,000,000 trades union
ists" against compulsory enlistment,
was introduced by the executive com
mittee when the National Labor con
fess met in Central hall, Westmin
ster.
The resolution was greeted with
cries of approval„ from all parts of
tbe hall. It contained expressions of
regret that "the solidarity of the na
tion has been gravely imperilled and
industrial and political liberty men
Iced by the attitude of the «ooscrip
tlonists."
,Ni&e hundred delegates, xepreeent
400 lab*r organizations, including
most powerful unions la Great
n, were, in th$ir ,»ejU«»,wJtMJp the
meeting was called to order to deter
mine labor's attitude on the conscrip
tion policy oft the government
The majority of the delegates were
outspoken in opposition to any form
of conscription. One group had draft
ed a resolution for presentation, call
ing upon Arthur Henderson, labor
member of the Asquith ministry, to
resign at once.
Harry Gosling, trade union leader,
presided. Scattered about the hall
were a number of labor members of
parliament.
Preceding introduction of the anM
conscrlptlon resolution, the executive
committee presented a lengthy re
port emphasizing labor's "deep-rooted,
traditional and uncompromising hos
tility" toward conscription.
"This hostility cannot be outraged
with impunity," the committee chair
man read, and a storm of applause
swept the hall. "Especially is this
true since the wage earners have
volunteered with such splendid chiv
alry." The committee then offered
statistics to show that labor has more
than done its part |n filling the ranks
of the British armies. Recruiting fig
ures from large industrial centers
were presented and with them reports
of various unions, where memberships
have been depleted through loss of
unionists who surrendered their lives
in northern France.
The eyes of the nation were center
ed today upon the labor congress. It
was generally expected that the labor
delegates would pass a resolution op
posing conscription, but the govern
ment had hopes that strong trades

The Daily News viewed the situa
tion most pessimistically, predicting
not only the resignation of Arthur
Henderson, labor's representative in
the cabinet, but a grave domestic
crisis•, leading to a general election
within the next few weeks. The
News declared that the present gov
ernment lacks vitality and predicted
that a general election would result
in naming of a conservative ministry
of which Lloyd George would bo a
member. The Daily Mail declared the
government is facing the greatest in
ternal crisis of the war.

The Chronicle, the Daily Express
and the Morning Post atacked the
government bill, but it was supported
by the Times and Daily Telegraph.
Despite the bitter opposition of both
laborltes and Irish party leaders in
commons, it is considered certain the
conscription bill will pass parliament.
The government was somewhat wor
ried today, however, over reports of
possible defections of members who
advocated a more drastic compulsion

"There is a disposition among some

Garrison said it was impossible and
it would be enormously expensive to

Federalizing of the national guard.
Garrison said, was impossible because
the government lacks authority over

be given the right to enter the con

recommended.
"Thus free discretion and choice
would be afforded either to stay In the

of rank," Garrison stated. He denied
the militia would be Injured by the
continental army's organisation.

the plan.

this suggestion," said Garrison. 'It Is
