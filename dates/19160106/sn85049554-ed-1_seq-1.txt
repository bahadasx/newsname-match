Naval Gunners in Charge.
Gunners of the royal Italian navy

Washington to Ob/«eir:
Washington, Jan. 8.—The state 4e*
partment probably will take-up with
the Italian government the questtbn tff
guns mounted on the liner Giuseppe
Verdi with a view to having the piece*
dismounted before the ship leaves Am-^
erlcan waters.
The guns on the Verdi promise t®
bring up again a point which has been
disputed since the war began. At tho
outset of the war the United States
took the position that 1f a vessel car*
ried guns of less than 6-tnches in call*
ber, mounted well aft, it would not b«
considered armed.
Other Nations Comply.
The state department later had in*
formal negotiations with Great Britain
and France thru their ambassadors
here and asked that any guns what
ever be removed from the big passen
ger liners coming into American porta.
The two foreign governments infor
mally, and also reserving their rights
compiled.
State department officials expressed
the view today that the Italian gov
ernment probably would be asked in
formally to dismount the guns on th*
Verdi before she sails from the United!
States.
