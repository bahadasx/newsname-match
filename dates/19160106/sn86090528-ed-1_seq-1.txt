MONASTIR, Serbia, Dec. 1. (Fly
mall.) A man sanding In the middle
of the road logins through a tele
scope on a tripod!
"That's our front," says Colonel
Vassich, pointing at the man. The
car stops and we get out. On our
left a gentle slope runs from the road;
on our right there Is also a slope and
ttretching up these are ribbons of red,
winding along the face of the hills.
They are the Serbian trenches.
Before us unfolds a flat, beautiful
valley, the valley of Hallnchl. Six
miles across this valley rise moun
tain sides: The Golden Cross, 3,M)0
feet high; and other topping peaks.
Over there are the Bulgars; if they
can come across this flat valley, Mon
BMir, eighteen miles behind us, is
theirs with all the women and chil
dren, churches, schools and homes at
their mercy.
"Look through your glasses and you
will see hem," says Commander Vas
sich. His voice Is tired and his eyes
. are dark and drooping; he wears two
f coats, though the sunshine Is warm
and a huge muffler is about his neck.
The three hundred battles he has
passed through in the various Serbian
wars have left their mark upon bis
body, but it in his mind that has
planned this positon that is keeping
the Bulerar regiments away from Moa
astir. You find yourself more Inter
ested In him and in hi muffled form
than in what tho telescope may reveal.
There they are! The Bulgars! A
wagon train Is marching along a road
at the foot of the distant hilts, soldiers
tramp behind it. It's the same road
you've been riding on, only you have
4,,ot been on that particular section
of it.
They're 'aunian beings over there,
as we are. But they seem of an
other world. Death lies between here
and there. Through glasses over
there, men are looking at us, perhaps.
To them we seem Inhuman and the
Serbian trenches along the hill slopes
are places of death, the width of the
world away. And yet we two sets of
humans "are only six, sunshiny miles
apart, across a beautiful valley filled
with ploughed farms. It's the black
magic of war.
"Pick them up! Tick them up!"
You turn fi-om the telescope at the
sound of the commander's voice. He
is standing at the edge of the trench
. talking to a soldier and pointing down
at the ground where a score of cart
ridee clips are lying; they are full
clips, too, five cartridges In each
frame.
"They wouldn't fit my gun," said
the soldier.
"What kind of a gun have you got?"
asked Colonel Vassich.
"A Bulgarian gun that I took away
from a Bulgar at Babouna Pass."
"But you haven't got any ammuni
tion for it," said the Colonel.
"Oh, I took that from him, too."
The colonel's smile of pleasure is
praise enough. The soldier, standing
In his waist deep trench, looking up
at his commander seems surprised
and astonished 'when. In addition to
the colonel's smile, he feels the colo
nel's hand upon his shoulder and
hears the Serbian equivalent for
"good boy!"
We climb the slope, walking behind
the trench. The Bulgars are too far
away for rifle fire and their cannon,
for some reason we do not know, are
Just now silent. But the men remain
In the trenches, according to orders.
Each man has his rifle ready, resting
on the ridge of earth before him.
They are elderly men; not one ap
pears to be less than" tr.
third and laBt reserve."
You may wonder about Germany's
reserves and how many men she can
yet put into the field; or about how
many classes France has left, or how
many soldiers Great Britain can raise,
tut there's neither any doubt nor any
secret about Serbia's resources. She's
almost through; she's on her last
class of meu; men In the fifties and
more.
Here they are, before your eyes,
with their rifles ready. Their beds
are these nests of straw along the
bottom of the trenches. Their fire
sides (and most men of 50 have
learned to love their firesides), are
these little ovens cut Into the clay
sides of the trenches. Their, meals
are raw, fresh meat, cut only a few
hours since from these fresh goat
hides that dot the grass behind the
trenches. Their drinks are made
from the muddy water that flows
through the little roadside creek.
Their bed clothes are the garments
they wear. Their comforts are nil.
With memories of home and chil
drenall those deep memories that
are part of the habits and life of a
man of 50 they spend their time here
In the mud and the rain, the sunshine,
the wind and the darkness, waiting to
kill or be killed, willing to defend
with their lives the city of Monastir,
the last big city that is left to' the
Serbians of all the cities that, two
months ago, they were so proud of.
Just the smile of this grim and quiet
colonel pleases them.
"What Is that?" asks Colonel Vas
sich as he stops before a brown, hairy
knapsack lying at the trench edge.
The man in tho trench looks up, sa
lutes and says It's a southern Ceruiau
knapsack such as you see on the
French front; and that his son took
it from a German 6 weeks ago near
Belgrade and sent it to him to use.

SUSPEND DEFERRED
CABLE MESSAGES
FOR SHORT PERIOD
The Western Union Telegraph com
pany announces that owing to a tem
porary shortage of facilities it will be
necessary to suspend for a few days
the handling of trans-Atlantic deferred
messages. Every effort wiir be
made to restore deferred serv-
ice and cable letters at the ear
liest moment and the public will be
promptly advised as soon as condi
tions permit the restoration of these
services.
The company states that the neces
sity for this action is greatly regretted
but the suspension of deferred service
by other trans-Atlantic cable compa
nies some days ago, has resulted In
a flood of deferred messages to West
ern Vnlon cables and it therefore be
comes necessary In order to protect
the company's regular patrons and its
own expedited service and the com
pany temporarily suspends all but the
regular full-paid service.

ARE BUSY
AT FRISCO
By United Press.
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 6. The
wreckers' ruthless hands are upon the
exposition. Soon its beauties will be
a heap of plaster, timbers and mem
ories. Today a grunting engine wheezed
its way through the grounds where
once Joyful throngs congregated. It
backed its string of freight cars Into
palaces and dragged out the last of
the exhibits and furnishings. it
poured its smoke over the tower of
Jewels and upon beautiful, snowy
statues. Throughout the ground the
doleful sound of hammers and picks,
of ripping lumber and rattling plaster
were heard. Sharp bargainers di
rected the destruction of their prizes,
the state buildings and other edifices,
costing thousands to build, but sold
! for a trifle.
A lone barker tried to sell post-exposition
visitors souvenir coins. A
wheel chair bearing a couple of old
ladles, creaked through what is left
of the once gem city.
High over the wondiously beautiful
court of the universe and court of
abundance, circled lty sta ulls from
off the bay. Around the buildings a
flock of frighten ad doves rose as now
and then the tread of a visitor
startled their calm. Empty fountains
rusted. The palaces, some of them,
still stood. But they showed signs of
decrepitude; the plaster walls were
chipped; the brilliant banners drooprd
and faded Iu the winter rains.
Sidewalks were littered with rub
bish. Amid the ruins In the gardens
blossomed a few geraniums. The
other flowers were dead. All about
was fin air - of desolation. A few
grimy workmen replaced the thou-
filled the grounds.
The romance of moonlight nights
along the bay, fragrant with soft
breezes, touched with orange blos
soms, was replaced by the grim real-,
ity of decay, ruin, lonesomeness. A
chill wind blew from the hills; clouds
filled the sky with gloom.
On the Joy zone that noisy, rol
licking zone desolation lay deep.
Stella wondrously beautiful Stella
was gone. Just a ragged sign marked
her erstwhile abiding place. The
giant dummy fiures outside of Toy
land, reared their heads like lonesome
monsters wondering where their
crowds had vanished to. The house
of The Girl in Blue was boarded up.
The pool of the diving girls is In ruins.
Strange silnce rests upon the once
clattering coasters. It is indeed a
forsaken city.
