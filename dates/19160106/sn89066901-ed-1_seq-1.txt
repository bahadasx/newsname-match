Obituary
He man and Celia Seymour
lived in West Hartford, Conu
Six children were born to them,
three boys and three girls. Th
third child, Edward Payson Sey
mour, the subject of our sketch,
was born March 17, 1836, and
died Dec.81, 1915, aged 79 years,
9 months and 14 days.
When lie was a small child, his
parents emigrated to Danville,
Des Moines Co., Ia., where they
lived for many years. During
this time, when not in school, he
helped his parents on the farm.
Sept.26, 1881, he married Mar
tha M. Hurlbut, of New London.
She died in July, 1901. They
lived in New London for a num
ber of years, where he was en
gaged in various mercantile pur
suits aud where their only son,
Jay Elsworth Seymour.was born.
In 1882 they moved to Marion,
Ia , where Mr. Seymour entered
into the contracting and building
business. He contracted for and
built many beautiful homes in
and around Marion. He followed
this business until 1905, when he
came to Douglas Co., Mo.
During early manhood he and
his wife united with the Metho
dist Episcopal church.
Mr. Seymour was a man of
sterling honesty and strict integ
rity of character. As an instance
of the high esteem in which he
was held, he erected, while at
Marion, Ia., an elegant residence
for the construction of which no
written contract was made, the
house owner having so much con
fidence in Mr. Seymour that he
considered nothing more than a
verbal understanding necessary.
His word was as good as his
bond both were gilt-edge
The funeral was conducted by
Rev.Joseph Davis Saturday from
the Prairie Hollow General Bap
tist church, using Job 14:1Q,14J
as a text, after which the re
mains were laid to rest in the
cemetery near by, there to await
the Resurrection Morn.
Another father has passed on
to that undiscovered country,
from whose bourne no traveler
e'er returns. May God's bless
ings rest on his son and his son's
wife, who had given him a home
in his old age and cared for him
in his declining years and during
his Htniction. May the iieace of
God comfort them in their lonely
hours. JOSEPH DAVIS
Owen Gorman, aged 23 years,
died Monday at his home in
Hartville, death resulting from
pneumonia. He is survived by
a wife and three daughters, two
brothers Dr. Harold Gorman of
St. Louis and James Gorman of
Hartville, besides many other
relatives and hots of friends.
He was the son of W. H. Gorman
and assisted his father in the
former's store at Hartville. Rev.
John Russell conducted the fun
eral Tuesday afternoon.
