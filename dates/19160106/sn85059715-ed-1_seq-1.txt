Ohio River Disaster is Described
by the Captain of the
Wrecked Steamer.
RESCUE WORK ORDERLY
Special Train Picks Up Survivors
Scattered along River
Bank for Four Miles.
tar ASSOCIATED PRIEST
PARJKERSBURO, Jan. 6?Captain
Brady M. Berry and sixty-two pas-'
sengers and crew of the steamer Kanawha,
which sank in the Ohio river;
at dam. No. 19, last night, arrived
here early today on a special train
gent out by the Baltimore and Ohio;
> railroad to pick up survivors scatter
ed atong four miles of the river1
front on the West Virginia side. Cap-1
ta'n Berry said that while he saw no
j one in the water and did not know;
| thnt any had been lost, he felt sure
there had been fatalities. He was
waiting, he said, until daylight to return
to the scene of the disaster,
where a thorough search would be
made. Meanwhile the Kanawha, a
total loss, lay bottom up in the stream
five mile frohi where It struck.
"We were moving swiftly down
. stream about 7:30 o'clock last night
/ with a crew of about forty and some
twenty passengers of whom a dozen
1 were women," snld Captain Berry.
"Tiie weather had been bad but 'Just
as we were approaching the lower
end of the lock wall on the Wem'
Virginia side, we were struck by a
severe storm. Ordinarily a light j
i shines out from the mast on the wall,
but last night there was no light,
there, and before we knew what was;
' happening the Kanawha had struck i
the iron pier a little forward of the!
I holier. It started to sink lmmedl
/ ately and wlthiil three minutes bad
| gone down.
"I shouted for the boats and in a
' very few minutes the men were get-,
ting out- the; four life boats we had I
on board, tfhe cries of the.passsn^
i gers aroused the men at the lock.;
They put out a yawl and cattle to our
assistance. The lights went out wlth!
in a minute after we struck and there
wnn arreat confusion. We managed
I alter a llttie while to convince the!
I passengers we would get them oil,
and hurried thera to the hurricane
deck. '
| "The Kanawha began to turn on
Its side and It continued to turn, the;
people moving always towards the
top and the water rose higher and
higher while we were taking them,
off. Finally lt/turned completely over j
hut fertdnately the most of them had
been removed by this time, but when I
the last man stepped into the life-:
boat it was bottom up on the river
bed.
"More than an hour elapsed from
the time we bit the lock wall until;
all were off and as someone was I
being-landed every time a boat madoi
'' a trip to the shore/you can see that j
I survivors were scattered shivering In j
I the cold and suffering from a shock.
I through a distance of fully four;
| miles along the shore. When I sawj
| that all were off I shouted to the;
crew And tooK me on. wo u??
rounded up as many as we could and
soon afterwards beard tbat the Baltij
more and Ohio was sending a train as j
i far as Meldah's station to take us
\ back to Parkersburg.
"I don't know whether anyone
^ was lost. The crew numbered bei
tween forty and forty-flvo and wo {
I had about twenty passengers. I am
f unable to say how many because the
passengers list was lost with everything
else on board. I know there
were twelve women and we got them
off first, not a man except the boat-;
men to row them to shore being al-1
lowed to leave the boat until they,
were gone. One of the women I !
found In a fainting condition at the i
pilot* house and we got her off, too.,
"I heard some* of the boys say that'
"#e boat load went to the Ohio shore i
nut of that I don't know, but we will
clear that up In the morning. The)
cargo was worth something, too, because
we had a good trip."
i' Captain Berry, who lives at WllIldmstown,
W. Va., had organized his
searching party by daybreak and re
turned to tne piace wneio iuc m?i
Hank to continue his search tor those |
of the passenger and crew who hare
not been accounted tor. It was
known that some ot them had found
hospitable houses along the river
where they were landed.
Among the passengers who were
taken oft the boat and brought here
on the rescue train were Mr. and Mrs.
K. W. Edgerton and Mr. and Mrs, A.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.?Ambassador
Pcnfleld cabled today he hatl presented
informally to the Vienna for-,
elgn office the American government's
request for any information on the
destruction of the British liner Persia, 1
and at the time of filing bis despatch
had received no reply.
American Consul Garrels at Alexandria
reported that the affidavits he
had gathered from the Persia Burvlvors
gave no more proof that a submarine
torpedoed the liner or regarding
its nationality than were contained
in his first despatches.
Ambassador Pendeld was instructed
to ash the Austrian government Informally
for any information It might
have on the Persia which would develop
the facts in the case and help
the American government decide how
the liner was destroyed. Consul Oar- '
rein was instructed to get affidavits
for the same purpose.
So far the only actual statement
tending to prove that the, ship was
torpedoed came from one of the officers
of the ship. He said he saw what i
he thought was the wake of a torpedo.
No submarine was seen at any time.
Further despatches from Ambassador
Pen&eld are expected at the state
department, probably late today and ,
at any event tomorrow. Meanwhile
other consular agents along the Mediterranean'coast
are, like Consul Carrels
seeking further information.
The absence of further definite advices
is holding the situation so far ;
as any action by the United States" is i
rnnrerned at a standstill.

As Shown by a Review Made i
by Secretary Dudderar of ;
the Board of Trade.
(By 0. W. Dudderar, secretorytreasurer
of tbe Clarksburg Board of
Trade.)
A brief report of the work of the
Agricultural Farm Bureau since the'
employment of County Agent Zlnn
may 1 last .as prepared by tbe secretary
for tho University Conference
Monday, will doubtless Interest local
people.
Tbe Harrison County Farm Bureau
was organized early in tbe year after
a week's campaign in tbe county conducted
by State Agent Frame and the
secretary of tbe board of trade. W.
D. Zinn began bis work May 1, 1916.
Miss Minnie Martin under direction of
the' state agent and Miss Sadie Ouse
man haa been working on lines ot
domestic economy, through the cooperation
of the bureau, the county
court, the school board and the federal
government, since July 1. Through
the efforts of the local board of trade
to create this organization and the
activities of Mr. Zlnn, tho business
men of the community and the business
men of the farms in this county
have been getting closer together and
we are all waking up to the realization
that every farm In the trade territory
is in fact a factory, producing
material absolutely essential to the
community's life, that the fanners
grain, vegetable .sand fruit, hogs and
cattle produced with an expenditure
of much labor come to the city as
"raw material," then to be prepared
ror consumption through various processes,
which furnish employment to
a very considerable number of people
and that agriculture after all is America's
greatest industry. The following
is a few things that the Harrison
County .Farm . Bureau has accom
jllshed since Its work began:
Heretofore our farmers purchased
ehat lime they uged from Berkeley
musty and other places at a heavy
ransportatlon expense. During the
tight months eight limestone pulvers
tave been located-In the county with
i total Crushing capacity of 140 tons
>f ground limestone per day. This Is
tow being used instead of commercial
line and is costing the fanners In
ome cases not to exceed the actual
rknsportatlon expense of the buiped
Ime, and during the coming year hunIreds
of acres of land will.be treated
vhlch would otherwise remain sour
rnd unproductive.
The production of wheat was alnoet
discontinued and fields heretoore
that were left bare or sown to j
