MANY CHESTS AT
WCOBSOH-NELSON
WEDDING
BRILLIANT SOCIAL FUNCTION
WHEN PROMINENT MONTANA
DRUGGIST WEDS ONE OF MI-
NOT'S MOST POPULAR GIRLS.
I Mr. and Mrs. Martin Jacobson en­
tertained one hundred and fifty guests
the evening of January fifth, in honor
of the marriage of their daughter,
Aletta Christina, and Raymond Eu­
gene Nelson, of Joplin, Montana.
The large rooms of the Jacobson
home were artistically decorated with
smilax, pink roses and carnations, and
the wedding ceremony was performed
under a canopy formed of smilax and
pink roses, through which the light of
dozens of electric bulbs showed. Dur­
ing the service, only candles and the
canopy lights were used in the rooms.
Mr. C. D. Aaker played the Men­
delssohn wedding music as the pro­
cession came down the stairway, and
also played the accompaniments for
the songs that were sung before and
after the ceremony. Just before half
past eight, the hour set for the ser­
vice, Mr. Lafe Flaten sang "O Per­
fect Love" and Miss Blanche Lynch
sang "A Birthday."
As the notes of the wedding march
were heard, the groom and his best
man, Chester Jacobson, and Rev.
Nicolay Nilsen, pastor of the Zion
Lutheran church, took their places to
await the coming of the bridal party.
Little Miss Almira Jacobson, led the
procession, dressed in a frock of or­
gandy, and carrying the ring in the
heart of a lily. The bridesmaids, Miss
Mildred Jacobson and Miss Amanda
Hamre, of Regina, Canada, followed.
They wore dresses of pink taffeta,
with Castle caps of gold lace and pink
maline, and they carried baskets of
Killarney roses. Mrs. Floren Wetch,
(nee Mabel Hunter), as matron of
honor, wore a gown of peach colored
crepe de chine, with trimming of bor­
dered net and lace, and her bouquet
was an armful of Ophelia roses.
The bride was met at the foot of
the stairway by her father, who gave
her away. She looked very girlish
and attractive in her bridal gown of
white crepe meteor, trimmed with
lovely lace and pearls. The skirt was
cut a round, short length, and ended
in a pointed train, and the bodice was
formed of a coatee of lace, with pearl
trimming. Pearls and valley lilies
held her veil in place, and she carried
a huge shower bouquet of orange
blossoms and valley lilies.
Rev. Nilsen used the ring cere­
mony, and gave a very impressive
little sermon to the bridal couple. Im­
mediately after the exchange of vows,
Miss Irma Jones sang "I love you
truly."
During the reception, a five piece
orchestra, stationed on the stair land­
ing, played a program of music, and
a buffet supper was served from nine
o'clock on during the evening, in the
dining-room, which was decorated in
red. Red carnations and roses were
on the buffet and side board, and the
table centerpiece was a wedding cake,
with a .spray of red roses tied with
tulle, decorating the top. Clusters of
little red candles in crystal holders
were also on the tablo. Mrs. J. B.
Taylor poured coffee, and the supper
was served by Misses Miriam Taylor,
Eva Hamre, Hazel Crabbe, Mae Sco
field, and Mrs. Keeler.
Mrs. Jacobson wore a gown of
bronze green with vest and sleeves
of black and gold net, and a corsage
of violets and pink sweet peas. Mrs.
Earl Jacobson wore crepe de chine
and pink sweet peas.
The prominence of the Jacobson
family in this section of the state, has
made the wedding one of deep inter­
est. They are among the earliest res
dents of Ward county, and hundreds
of friends who have been associated
with them for years will extend cor­
dial good wishes for the future of the
young people, who will make their
home in the little Montana city. Mrs.
Nelson is a very accomplished music­
ian, is a graduate of the Minneapolis
School of Music, and has appeared
frequently before the public. Mr.
Nelson was associated with the Econ­
omy Drug Co. in this city for several
years, and has numerous friends in
the city. He has been interested in
the drug business in Joplin for more
than a year, and has a snug little
home waiting for his bride.

WOLWORTH STORE

BIG CONCERN BUYS FAU
CHALD'S FIVE AND TEN CENT
STORE AND WILL TAKE POS­
SESSION JULY 1.
The F. W. Wolworth Co., owners of
834 five and ten cent stores in the
United States, has bought the Fau­
chald five and ten cent store in this
city and will take possession July 1.
The Wolworth Co. have secured a
lease on the building occupied by Mr.
Fauchald, the contract for the sale of
which Mr. Fauchald recently secured.
The company also bought the Fau­
chald five and ten cent store at Devils
The Wolworth Co. are capitalized
for $65,000,000 and last year in their
stores did $66,000,000 worth of busi­
ness. They estimate that 500 people
will visit their Minot store daily.
When the Wolworth people decide to
locate in a city, it is good evidence
that that town is of some consequence.
They buy their merchandise in im­
mense quantities, taking the entire
output of numerous factories and are
thus able to give wonderful values.
A Wolworth store is a mighty good
thing for a city.
The Fauchald five and ten cent
store has done a phenomenal business.
During the past year, the store has
had on an average of 350 customers
daily.
HINOT WANTS THE

COUNTY FATHERS WILL AT­
TEND CONVENTION AT VAL­

The county commissioners from
Ward county will attend the annual
convention of the county commission­
ers' association of North Dakota to be
held at Valley City Jan. 12 to 14.
Minot will make a fight to get the
1917 convention. The commissioners
met in this city five years ago and
many of them who are still on the var­
ious boards, remember the good time
they had. The Association of Com­
merce will probably send a represen­
tative to extend the invitation.
Olaf Lokensgard, of Sawyer, com­
missioner from the fifth district, is
treasurer of the state association.

A Good Habit to Form.
We have started out the new year
with the very largest and best stock
of lumber and other kinds of build­
ing material we have ever carried. We
have received several car loads of
bright new material which we are un­
loading this week. We recently en­
larged our yard extensively and the
way it begins to look, every square
foot of space will be taken up with
our various lines of material. There
is one big advantage in dealing with
us. The chances are 99 to 100 that no
matter what you need, you will find
exactly what you want at this yard.
Of course, the price is bound to be
right and we are not a little proud of
the service we are able to render our
customers. Get the habit of coming
to the Rogers Lumber Co. for your
needs. H. S. Johnson, Manager.
School Bus Caught on Fire.
The school bus from Burt school
district No. 2 was brot to the city for
repairs. The bus caught fire from an
overheated stove used to warm its in­
terior and might have gone up in
smoke but for the good work of the
Drady fire department.

Henry Renfeldt bought the Harry Gil­
lespie eoal ofllce, located just east of
the Minot Grocery Co., and took posses­

farming and will undoubtedly do just as
well in his new venture.
]. D. GEIST'S
FATHER IS DEAD
SUPERINTENDENT OF COUNTY
FARM CALLED TO VINTON, IA.,
ON SAD MISSION—DECEASED
WELL KNOWN HERE.
John D. Geist, superintendent of the
county farm, has returned from Vin­
ton, la., where he was called by the
death of his father. Mrs. Geist, who
was visiting friends in Minneapolis
at the time, accompanied him and
their son, Charles, came out from Chi­
cago to attend the funeral. The de­
ceased was well known in Minot, hav­
ing spent two months with his son
here a year ago. Four sons, John,
Will, George and James, and two
grandsons, Chas. Geist and Milton
Harris, were the pall bearers. The
following is taken from the Vinton
Review:
GEO. F. GEIST
Geo. F. Geist a resident of this city
for a number of years, passed away
some time Monday night at his home
in Southeast Vinton. His demise was
discovered Tuesday morning by his
daughter, Mrs. Rabb, with whom he
made his home. He had been in poor
health for some time but his condition
had not been such as to cause any un­
easiness to his family.
Mr. Geist was born in Shuylkill
county, Pa., Nov. 26, 1839, and was a
son of Isaac and Elizabeth Geist. His
boyhood was spent at his birth place
and he was there married, on March
25, 18G6, to Elizabeth Kembel. For a
long period of years the family home
was at Independence, la., from where
they came to Vinton ten years ago.
The wife and mother passed away
October 22, 1912, and since that time
one of the daughters kept house for
the father. He was the father of ten
children, all of whom survive, as fol­
lows: John D., Minot, N. Wm. M.,
Camden, N. J. James M., Independ­
ence George C., Waterloo Mrs. Em­
ma Rabb and Mrs. Anna Kelso, Vin­
ton Amelia Wilson, Brandon Ida B.
Walker, Weyerhauser, Wis. Lizzie
Davis, Chicago, and Mrs. Irene Noble,
Winfield, Kansas. Mr. Geist was a
quiet, friendly old gentleman and a
member of the United Brethren
church.
Funeral services will be held at the
U. B. church at 2:30 o'clock this after­
noon, conducted by Rev. Uhlenhoop.
Burial will be in Evergreen cemetery.
Soil Improvement Through Timothy
Timothy has been found to increase
the wheat yields on the North Dako­
ta Experiment Station Farm. The
first crop of wheat after the timothy
was increased 1 4-5 bushels. The sec­
ond crop by 8.9 bushels, the third croy
by 6 1-6 bushels, and the fourth crop
by 6.75 bushels.

Copenhagen, Denmark, Jan. 3.—The

Lloyd Jones of Chicago, asked Sam
Clark, traveling companion of Gover­
nor Hanna of North Dakota, who is
ill, how Hanna was getting along.
"None of your whole party inquired
about Hanna when he was really in a
dangerous condition," retorted Clark.

ONE OF THE PENNY CHAIN OF
STORES SECURES LEASE ON
BOYER BLOCK.
E. J. Neighbors, vice president of
the Penny corporation, was in Minot
recently and completed arrangements
to open one of the Golden Rule chain
of stores in this- city May 1, securing
a long lease on the Boyer block. South
Main street.
During 191G, the Penny concern will
add forty-five stores to its present
chain of eighty-five, four to be located
in North Dakota at the following
points: Minot, Williston, Valley City
and Dicknison. There are Golden Rule
stores now at Fargo, Grand Forks,
Wahpeton and Devils Lake.
Berf A. Young's Mother Died.
Bert A. Young of Parshall, while
visiting in Minot, received a telegram
telling of the illness of his mother,
Mrs. Ada Young, at Portland, Ore.
Upon his arrival at Portland, he found
both his mother and brother Charlie
down with pneumonia, his mother
dying two days after his arrival. His
brother is recovering. Both were
known in this city, having visited with
Mr. Young several years ago. His
mother was 79 years of age.
AUTO DRIVER ALMOST KILLED.
Bismarck, N. D., Jan. 3.—William
Ashwell, auto driver, drove before the
incoming Northern Pacific train No. 1
Sunday night and his automobile was
demolished and he was picked up 100
feet from the point of the collision
and taken to a hospital, badly smash­
ed. His most serious injury is a frac­
tured skull. He may live.
Co-operative Ownership of Sires
The farmer with only a few animals
can hardly afford to keep pure bred
males. Yet he cannot afford to use
scrubs. One solution of the problem
is for several neighbors to club to­
gether and secure the pure bred sires
needed. This will really make the cost
of the pure bred sire less to each
farmer than would be the cost of scrub
sires if each owned one.
ME MURDERS AND
SUICIDE AT RAY
KEEPS GIRLS PRISONERS BESIDE
MOTHER'S CORPSE. HAD BEEN
ATTENTIVE TO OLDER DAUGH­
TER, BUT WOMAN OBJEC TED.
Williston, N. D., Jan. 1.— Using an
iron bar as a weapon, Bruce Parkin­
son, alias Guy Hall, an escaped pris­
oner from the Washington state re­
formatory, employed on the A. M.
Hart farm three miles west of Ray,
this county, beat in the heads of Mrs.
Hart and two sons, 9 and 13 years old,
Thursday. He hid the bodies of the
boys in a haystack.
Shows Corpes to Daughters
That night he drove to Ray, where
the two Hart daughters have been vis­
iting their aunt, Mrs. McFarlane, and
returned with them to the farm. Lead­
ing them into the room where then
mother's body lay, he said:
"There she is. See what a terrible
thing I have done."
Threatening to shoot if either of
them attempted to escape, Parkinson
kept the girls prisoners in the ghastly
death chamber until 2 a. m. yesterday,
when he ordered them into a vehicle
and began a wandering drive that end­
ed at 8 a. m. at the McFarlane home.
Puts Bullet in Brain
When he entered the home ahead of
the girls he told Mrs. McFarlane that
he had something to tell her. She no­
ticed his revolver and tried to wrest
it from him. He broke away, dashed
upstairs and fired a bullet through his
head, dying instantly.
Parkinson had been employed tem­
porarily at the farm, while Mr. Hart
has been in Iowa, where he wais called
by the illness of his mother. He was
about 21 years old, and of good ap­
pearance, but addicted to the use of
liquor. Both yesterday and the day
before he had been drinking heavily.
He had been paying attentions to the
oldest daughter, 17, which were ob­
jected to by the girl's mother.
Notes in Victim's Mouth
When officers hastened to the farm
house they found two notes sticking in
the dead woman's mouth. One read:
"This is the beginning of my finish
work of crime. Bruce Parkinson, alias
Buy Hall, escaped prisoner of Wash­
ington State reformatory."
The other read: "Please forgive me
for I am insane. Guy Hall."
Parkinson had been selling grain
from the Hart farm without authority,
and discovery of this by thtf two boys
may have led to their murder. Mrs.
Hart, .who was 42 years old, was killed
in the door yard and the body dragged
into the house.
"Williston, N. D., Jan. 3.—Two possible
motives for the murder of Mrs. A. M.
Hart and her two sons by Guy Hall,
alias Bruce Parkinson, have been un­
earthed by Williams county officials,
and they probably explain the triple
murder and Hall's suicide.
One of these was Mrs. Hart's denial
of Hall's continued friendship with Mrs.
Hart's eldest, daughter, which friend­
ship was forbidden by tlie mother be­
cause of Hall's addiction to liquor.
Another possible clue is found in the
fact that Hall had several days previous
to the murder hauled a load of flax to
market, selling the same and pocketing
the proceeds.
The coroner's investigation into the
triple murder and suicide leads him to
believe that Hall first killed the boys,
and then killed the mother. That the
boys were slain while making inquiry
with reference to the proceeds for the
load of flax, is the generally accepted
theory.
Hall's threat against the life of
Orace McFarland. a niece of Mrs. Hart,
which was uttered at Mrs. McFarland's
home in Ray, immediately preceded his
suicide, the arrival of George McFarland
preventing his fulfillment of the threat.
Officials have enquired, so far without
result, of officials in Washington, Hall
maintaining that he was an escaped
Inmate of the Washington state reform­
atory. No word has come from rela­
tives either, inquiry in Seattle, where
Hall said he lived, being vain.
The murderer's body was buried in
Ray today.
The remains of Mrs. Hart and two
sons probably will be buried tomorrow,
as the funerals were delayed because
of the absence of the husband and fath­
er, who was at the deathbed of his fath­
er in Iowa when the murders occurred.

CHAIR­..•sKaowssgi
OUR OWN STATE
IS PARADISE
SO SAYS "JIM" JOHNSON, WRIT
ING FROM CALIFORNIA HE
LEAVES TODAY FOR HONOLU­
LU.
James Johnson writes the Indepen­
dent an interesting letter from San
Diego, Cal., as follows:
"It is with pleasure that I can tell
you and my other friends that W. L.
Millar of Burlington has recovered so
that he is sitting up part of the day.
It is hard to down an old North Da
kotan, even if they do get away from
home.
"Well, we have taken in the fair
here at San Diego. Very fine, but com­
pared with San Francisco it is of
course outclassed. Nevertheless, it is
a great undertaking for so small a
town with one foot out of the grave.
We just returned from a trip in Mex­
ico, where the wind was blowing so a
grind stone was rolling along the
street. This is the time to see Cali­
fornia when a small stove or fire pot
is placed under nearly every tree and
when they have a cold night, the poor
fellows must first go and light them,
then see that there is oil enough for
the night. I saw one fellow that said
he had not slept for three nights. My
old friend, Dr. Crokat, said he made
$6,000 ni oranges, but it was out of
the pocket. The only fruit that seems
to pay here is raisin grapes. One man
said he was offered $2.00 a ton for
oranges if he would haul them to the
station. Hay is the best crop here by
a good deal. They often cut it five or
six times when they have plenty of
water, but water is such a scarce ar«
I tide here. There is lots of land that
could be worked, but there is no water
and when you have to buy the water
from the Spreckles Company, you are
better off without it. There is some
good ranch land, but no water for the
stock. Some day the government will
harness up the water that comes down
in the spring. That may help some,
but take it all through, North Dakota
is a Paradise compared with this, in a
general way, for a person who must
labor for his existence. You take men
like Frank Foote, who hus a splendid
business, and Jack Shipton, who is
foreman or superintendent for Mr.
Spreckles, Dr. Crokat and others, who
have means, are right in the push and
doing well, but that is the exception
rather than the rule.
"On the 6th we sail for Honolulu on
the Great Northern steamship. Mrs.
Johnson says to tell her friends that
she has not missed a feed yet. I am,
as ever,
"Yours,
"JIM JOHNSON."
Mr. Johnson will meet in Honolulu,
his brother whom he has not seen for
forty odd years and who was mourned
as dead for decades. His brother lives
