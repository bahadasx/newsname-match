-been thrown intoa ferment as the rej
suit of charges brought in-open meet

'-, According to the papers drawn by
Attorney Ernest perger, for Seaman,
; the complainant, and served yester
tf day afternoon by deputy sheriff W. G.
Steigler, much friction- has developed
recently in the order ' and culminated
last Sunday when Monsport is alleged
in their papers to have declared be
fore more than 100 persons that Sea
' man' was. "a crook and a robber? He
''is a dirty handed mean' thief and lie
.. does not belong among men."
It 1 is this - alleged. statement that
-yesterday caused: the arrest- of Mons

i subsequent release upon $3,000 bonds
furnished by Stephen Vargo, a saloon
leeeper of the West Snd. '
" Camp of Woodmen a bitter feeling has
been extant in the organization for
some time because of the long term
of office held by Seaman, who is one
of the"-foremen .at the American
Graphophone Co'.'s plant.- The office
pays some perquisities as 'well as a
email salary and 'it is said that many
keenly fought battles have been re
corded in the Jodge for-possession of

But recently question arose s to the
accuracy of the book-keeping methods

sult that, specual auditors were called
in and an examination , made: The
report fully, exonerated Seaman, but
-still dissension ruled in the lodge room
and insinuations, were made as- toac-
when Monsport' s words were repeated
to- Seaman .and upon the adviced of ,

state, diec suddenly tut the Bridgeport
hospital, last nlght-f Death -was
caused by ' oedema of the lungs, fol

. Mr. . Pfai had "been ill for several
days with a. severe cold. ' Pneumonia
followed jand sX 7 o'clock last night
he decided' to go to -the hospital for
treatment- He - died there at ,10
o'clock. His relatives are prostrat
ed 'with ' grief a this sudden , demise.
Mr. Pfau was 61 year of age and
was 'born in Bridgeport. His father,
Julius Pfau,now deceased, is said to
have sold the first lager beer dispens
ed here. His aloon was located at
12&& Main "street, where Julius Pfau,
a brother -of Fritz; still carries on the
bu'siness and where Fritz was employ
ed at the time of his death. . Mr.
Pfau learned thx business, working
for his father at a time when the
-old - fashioned German saloons' were
more on the style of restaurants. He
was an adept at all things that " per
tained to ' his business and took de
llight in cooking a tasty meal, pre
paring a lunch or in . decorating and
arranging a back bar.
About 1893, Mr. Pfau left his fath
er's employ and engaged in business
for: himself in .partnership with Mat
thew J, Maloney.' , They opened a
saloon in what is now the stock- quo
tation room of T. I. Watson & Co.
The entrance being in John street.
The place was known as the "Pretzel
and Shamrock." Soon afterward
Mr. Pfau conceived the idea of estab
lishing : the Amazon cafe. Mrs.
Jacques, widow of Dr.- Jean Jacques,
built for the partners, the three story
building in John street, now occupied
"by the Morris Plan bank. , , '
There, Mr. Pfau and his partner,
Mr. Maloney, established on an elab
orate scale a cafe which was after
ward known all over the country and
which,1 for its character, was one of
the'show spots of the city-s
Mr. Pfau adorned the place1 with
valuable paintings and costly statu
ary and behind the bar, tier upon tier
of shining glassware. He took much.'
pleasure tn decorating the interior of
the place especially at Christmas
time. Soon after he moved into the
Amazon cafe. .Mr. Maloney retired
from the business. Mr. Pfau after
ward continued the business alone for
about 1 8 years. - The business was
then taken over by his brother, Wil
liam Pfau, who . now conducts it in
Fairfield avenue. s
For a time Mr. Pfau managed what
is now the Pratt cafe in -Fairfield
avenue. For one summer season he
had charge of the Pine Grove Inn In
Stratford. During , the World's Fair
at St. Louis he managed one of the
largest cafes and restaurants on. "The
Pike" having undey his orders some
200 employes. Afterward he return
ed to Bridgeport and since that time
has been in the enploye of his broth
ers, Julius and William Pfau. . .
Mr. Pfau was of vivacious disposi
tion, seldom out of temper and had
th faculty of . winning friends and
keeping them. He was one of the
early members of the Bridgeport
lodge of Elks and took much pleas
ure in assisting in the staging of their
minstrel shows and entertainments.
At his death he held membership
in the Loyal Order of Moose, Bridge
port aerie of Eagles and the Bartend
ers' Union. ,
Besides his aged mother, who lives
at 420 North Washington avenue he
is survived by his wife, who, was Miss
May Swain; a sister Louise Pfau, a
choir singer; and two brothers, Julius
and William Pfau.
- His death marks the, passing Of one
of the 'mort active and interesting
personalities that has graced the bus

Doctors Say That One Out of
Every Three Families Has
Felt Disease. ,
Cheer np sad hearts and cease re
pining. 1 Behind each cloud is the sun
etui 'shining. The grip pandemic
If Sja pandemic now, not an epidemic
is expected to flee Into the Atlantic
Ocean, hard followed by a cold wave
that is sweeping south-westward and
which is now almost on the threshold
of Bridgeport.
Unlets all signs and indications,
observed "by medical authorities and
weather prophets fail, the gsrip, or la
grippe, or Influenza,, or lightning ca
tarrh or blitz-catarrh, as the case may
toe and -as one chooses, will be wiped
out before Sunday The cold, wave
that is merrily rushing hither is ex
pected to do great execution among
the germs of grip and for every Ill
ness that' has been caused by the lit
tle pests a few million of them will de
part this life.
That's the belief of competent med
ical authorities, although some differ
with them. The believers assert that
Bridgeport era may cheer up as- the
Weather Man has sent the following
bulletins ' ! " '
A: moderate cold wave prevailed
today, and will contin-ue tonight and
Friday from the Mississippi river east
ward to the Atlantia coast, the cold
expending southwest toward the gulf
states. ,
The -cold, they say, will cause the
death of - the germs. Others declare
that this is not so, but that a pneu
monia Increase may be looked for.
' It . is conservatively estimated that
13,0Wl persons in Bridgeport have
been ill with grip alone since the ill
ness became an epidemic. Just before
becoming a pandemic.
Dr. EL' A. McLellkn, health officer.
declared today that one could safely
say that one of every three ' families
in Bridgeport has been hit by the Ull
ness. r He said,-- he wouldn't dispute
anybody Who says 10,000 have been ill.
Today is the 25th day since the
trouble started. . During that time it
has swept aver Bridgeport, in com
mon with other cities in the United
States. . i Detroit and --Cleveland ' have
60,00 cases each, according to Surgeon
General Blue of the United States
Public Health Service. . , -
Seventy-four'persons died' last week
in New york directly of grip, ilts ef
fects may be Judged from the fact that
the normal average death rate is 140
every week. Last week it was nearly
double or 282. i '
Bridgeport and St. ' Vincent's 'hospi-
'tals have many person's suffering from
grip. So many are dying in this city
that there is a scarcity of hacks. ,
One of the remarkable things about
grip, whic his true about a pandemic
of any kind, is that in proportion to
Its increase, other illnesses fall off.
Thus, in Bridgeport, diphtheria and
scarlet ' fever are almost non-existent,
and the same condition is prevalent
throughout the Middle West.
Thucydides tells of the plague in
'Athens in 40o B. C. and recorded the
strange fact that there was no other
disease among the Athenians.
3-rip has oppressed' civilized men
at various times always, but it was
not until the last quarter of a century
that, it became a perrminent visitor. It
is recorded that, prior to .1889, grip
swept over the world in cycles of 30
years. - Records show that Europe felt
Its effects in the 30's and again in the
00"s but each time it disappeared ut
terly. In 1889, however, the. disease swept
from Siberia Into Russian Europe.then
to Germany and other Continental
countries, thence to the United States.
Since then it has been a steady
boarder In the United States. It had
been here before that, but never was
recognized and soon left. , . The per
manency of its call is attributed by
medical experts to the fact that mod
ern man travels so much and trans
portation is so feasy and far reaching.
Whereas,., in former times, the grip,
on a visit, gerierallly died with its hosts
because of lack of material, modern
man carries the germ about with him
and scatters them in all corners.
The Germans called it lightning ca
tarrh or blitz-catarrh, which is the
same thing. The French call It la
grippe and the - Americans grip, and
longer but uglier words. Medical men
call it influenza, which is a poorer
name than -grip, , interested ones say,
as it indicates griping pains. Grip Is
the old Saxonized German name for the
illness but modern Germans have for
gotten it.
TAX OS BILLBOARDS
NETS SMALL AMOUNT.
Hartford, Jan. 6 Since the law
passed at the last session of the Gen
eral Assembly imposing a tax of 1 cenb
per square fooWon billboards went
into effect on August 1,-1914, the rev
enue from it which Is collected by the
secretary of state, up to date has
amounted to only $500. This is a
much smaller amount than was ex
pected. A number of large owners
have ' not paid the tax, their delay
being due to a belief that the law is
not constitutional. It is understood
that a test case from New Haven will
be taken to the supreme court.

SO SOME QUIT JOBS
Completion' of International
Co.'s Damage Action
Hastened By Judge.
New Haven, Jan. 6. The hearing on
the petition for an injunction against'
the striking former employes of the
International. Silver company in its
Meriden and Wallingford factories,
asked for by the company, was re
sumed before Judge James H. Webb
today. The likelihood was that the
hearing would end during the day, as
Judge Webb is' to sit at Waterbury to
morrow. !
Counsel for both sides had, been
asked to present evidence in concise
form. Ralph O. Wells, of Hartford, for
the petitioners, devoted yesterday af
ternoon to calling individuals who re
lated, in response of his questioning,
experiences they had had, since the
strike began. Some told of being
called names, others of being threat
ened and others of being frightened
into staying away from the factories.
ISome! witnesses were strikers and
some workmen 'who had refused to go
out or, having gone out and joined the
-union had. gone in again. C. J. Dan
aher, tor " the respondents, frequently
cross-examined the witnesses, seeking
to ascertain, if Incidents related were
of recent , occurrence . or had taken
place in the early days of the strike.
'He sought to show and did show in
several instances that recently there
have been no untoward acts,
The chief witness, yesterday was
James BT Hill, president of the local
which gathered in strikers , and fac
tory employes who were not members
of a union when the strike was called
He swore that at all times he coun
selled a peaceful picketing and that
the Connecticut Federation of Labor,
the Meriden Central Labor Union and
President Stremlau, of the Federation
of Labor, had nothing to do with th
strike. . .
The' attendance was fully as. large
as yesterday when the hearing opened,
Mr. Wells devoted most -of the morn
ing to calling as witnesses men wta
had been sent to Wallingford to, apply
for positions in the factories there by
the employment bureau maintained by
the manufacturers. These men fwere
asked to relate what happened after
they reached Wallingford and why
they did not get work. Mr. Danaher
frequently objected to the questioning;
because the witnesses did not adhere
closely to what .they .personally expe
rienced nor did s they hold strictly to
what they said to persons whom they
met. , i -,
Mr. Danaher told the court that he
preferred to have witnesses use the
personal pronoun "I'' more.
William R. Taylor, grocer, who filled
from $15 to $30 worth of strike orders.!
was questioned by Mr. Wells as to
whether or not a committee of. strik
ers in Wallingford tried to Induce him
nbt to sell to workmen who had re
fused to i strike but the witness said
nothing of this sort was said to him
Everett C. Stevens; assistant' super
intendent of Factory. .P. told of see
ing a. crowd of strikers at the Wal

when aj carload of men eame in from
New Hven. The crowd induced these
men to return. He recalled that Mrs.
Scully .had said that there was no
strike on in Wallingford and help was
not needed. Witness saw others there
whom he mentioned by name.
W. C. SanfordAof New Haven', told
of two trips he had made to Walling
ford with the Intention of gettihg work
at the factory. On his first visit he
was told by a man who met him that
he did not need to go to the factory if
he was looking for work. He would
be taken care of. He said he did not

for some time blazed forth on Mpn

i clerk in charge of the recording of
realty transactions, refused to teach
the work to a new copyist, Mrs. Julia
Cuddy. . .
Mr. , Schultz in his requisition which
he will present to the board of appor
tionment is asking for an additional
copyist :in his office. It is his inten
tion if the board grants him the ad
ditional i clerk, to appoint Mrs. .Julia.
Cuddy to the position. For a number
of years conditional bills of sale have
not been recorded in the office. Mr.
Schultz now intends they shall' be recorded-at
a feevof $1 each. It was his
intention , to place Mrs. Cuddy in
charge of this work. The latter Is a
widow with two children. Her hus
band,, who was a son of the former
Personal Tax Collector Patrick Cuddy,
died a short time ago.
Monday morning, so the etory goes,
Mrs. Cuddy reported for instruction at
the town clerk's office. , Mies.. McGFrath
is in charge of th. Burr indes book on
which all realty transactions are re

the other side for the grantor. Town
Clerk Schultz introduced Mrs. Cuddy
and then instructed .Miss McGrath xto
show ' her the work. -Half an hour
passed and Mr. Schultz discovered
that Mv- Cuddy wasn't gerMng all the
instruction he thought desirable.
Mr. Schultz asked i Miss . McGraih
why she-had not obeyed his instruc

have ' replied that it had taken , her
years to acquire her. knowledge of

There ; the matter stands.' When
asked about the situation today Town
Clerk Schultz admitted the facts as

have on the Persia which would de- i
velop the facts in the case and help;
the American government decide how I
the liner was destroyed. Consul Gar-

So far the only actual statement j
tending to prove that the ship Was tor- i

of the ship. He said he saw what he
thought was the wake of a torpedo.
No submarine was seen at any time.
Further despatches from! Ambassa

department, probably late today and at
any event tomorrow. Meanwhile other
consular agents along the Mediterran
ehan coast, like. Consul Garrels, are
seeking further Information.
The absence, of further definite ad
i vices is .folding the situation alb far
as any action by the United States is
concerned, at a standstill. " a

tiohs committee, discussed the situa- 1
tion, with the President today and i
talked of other questions expected to '(
come up at a meeting of the. commit- j

The President told Senator Stone ,
no additional information of Impor- '
tance had; been received on the Persia
incident and expressed-the hope that
until the government had formulated
its policy there be as little discussion '
as possible in the Senate.
