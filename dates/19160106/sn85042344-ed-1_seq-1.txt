to tick eradication work culminated
in an attack this morning on the life
of County Attorney A. It, llulloek of

Hearing a noise at his window just
before day. Bullock raised up to look
out. but fell buck Just In time to miss
a load of buckahot Which came tear

blm not to attempt to prosecute men
suspected of having burned two barns
belonging to the county commis
Slonera Two of the latter recently
voted to carry on the tick work In tho
county. Directly after the shots were
fired into Bullock's house, blood
hounds were pul on the trail of the
men. but nothing developed. Threats
had also been made against an Ada
newspaper publisher for giving pub
licity to the conditions existing in the
county over the dynamiting of dip
ping vats recently. It Is feared that
further trouble will follow. It is only
h few years ago that four m n were
lynched in Ada following the murder
of one of the best citizens of the

heard a noise at the rear of the house,
lie immediately extinguished the light
and as he did so a shot crashed
through the window. The buckshot
passed within a few Inches of him and
