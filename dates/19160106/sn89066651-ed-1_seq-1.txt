IT IS TIME
TURN OVER
I The first of the year is a good time for breaking loose
from habits.
1 We feel sure that many people in this community who
do not trade with us, are really convinced that it would pay
to do so, yet they continue the HABIT of going to the
store which is most convenient.
J Break the habit of indifferent drug buying. Let us serve
you regularly during 1916.
It will pay you in satisfaction, security and saving.

The increased

one and two more than any others smv,. has hud a live months' run
but for some reason the crowds
in these grades are about normal
since tne Holidays.
The boys have their indoor
basket ball court in the Famous
Building, complete. A regulars
schedule of games will
beginS'
next week. We are trying to
come in for somo league games,
and from present indications 1
think we shall succeed in that
direction. The league was or-
ganized before we secured an -
indoor, or we might have
been,
on the regular schedule.
The high school students are
now practicing a play which they
expect to render during the
lat-.l
tor part of this month
The play
is a good one and each assign
ment seems to bq well adapted to
the player.
This year our school will
graduate its first four year class.
The candidates for graduation
are: Bonnie Hart, Lillie Spray-
berry, Isaiah Paris, Blair Buck-i
ley and Harry Gettings. These
young lollcs are to be con
gratulated upon having had the
; staying qualities about them to
finish the course offered them in
this school, and they are ex
tremely fortunate, I think,
in)
having' the honor ot being the1
llT-iitriTc-,'.T to Hatf.!i this oosreu.
In order to commemorate our After tlio installation, an cle
ft rst year as a first-class highant banquet-consisting of all

students expect to
get out a "High School Annual."
This plan has been in'mind as far i
back as two years ago, and we
are glad the time for work is
here. The undertaking of this
work will need the support ot
every one who can give us aid in
any way. The annuals will be
book size and will contain the
pictures of all the high school
students by classes; the athletic
activities will bo in pictorial
form; in fact, all the activities of
! the school will be shown by the
best pictures we can get. A
history of the school will be a
part of the literary work of the
editorial staff getting out the an
nual. These books will be sou
venirs worthy of being kept as
such by anyone. The expense of
publishing those will, neces
sarily, bo large, and only a lim
ited number will be published.
Tlie soliciting committee will call ij. ., , . r , ,
., . ,, in . , li' Memphis for several days
on those who would ke to havoi . .. .., , ..
. tl . ., , . i visit with relatives,
annuals the price, the lowest wo !
can figure it, will
bo one dollar.
We hopo every pation in the
school who can possibly afford to
subscribe will do so, as yon can
not. secure a copy if your nauio
is not on the list.
Help us make the last half of
school the better half. Keep

larly and you will bo
doing one .
of the essentials towards making
ho last half of the term the bet

Have you visited school during
the term? Then why haven't you?
