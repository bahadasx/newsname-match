So Declares Garrison, Argu
ing in Favor of National
Preparedness.
POINTS TO WIDE
SPREAD INTERESTS
Philippines, Alaska and Pan
ama Cause for Greater
Needs.
Washington, Jan. 6.—Secretary
Garrison today laid before the house
military affairs committee his formal
.argument In behalf of the adminis
tration's army plan, which is designed
to give the country, a definite military
policy.
It proposes the creation of a mobile
federal force of more than a million
men in six years, an accumulation of
a huge reserve of ammunition and
equipment, elaborate extension of
coast defenses, the whole project in
volving an Increased expense of $600,
000,000, and an annual war depart
ment budget thereafter of more than
$200,000,000,*compared ..with an aver
age of $100,000,000 for the last few
years.
Integrity at Stake.
"The integrity of the* nation and its
very existence," the secretary said,
reading from the lengthy document
he had prepared, "may depend upon
what is done in this matter at this
time. This great opportunity will be
lost unless a wise, sensible and prac
tical policy is the result of the consid
eration and action of this congress.*
Must Make Good.
Referring to the iar&«.n.ad military
responsibilities of the nation, reach
ing into insular possessions, China,
Alaska and the Panama canal zone.
Garrison added:
"We have determined and announc
ed that the sovereignty of the other
republics on this hemisphere shall re
main inviolable, and must therefore at
all times stand ready to make good
our proposition in this connection."
Facing a Crisis.
"There is a disposition on the part
of some," Garrison continued, "to as
sume that we are facing a crisis. The
only way to meet an emergency is by
adopting emergency measures. The
.personnel and material needed for
"military purposes should be immedi
ately mobilized. Every nerve should
be strained, and every resource drawn
upon, and npthing overlooked necejs
saryto,preserve and defend us re
gardless of cost and of other consid
erations. -.jiv:
ftiwlt ftSnl Army.
There is common agreement among
those who have studied the subect
intelligently that we should have a
force in the continental United States
of 500,000 men subect to call. Our
Immediate problem, therefore .seems
to be how shall we meet those re
quirements.
The adjutant geenral reaches the
conclusion that he cannot expect un
der the present conditions, to recruit
more than 50,000 men per year for
the army. It would therefore seem
impractical In the last degree to con
sider that the problem can be solved
by providing for a standing army of
•small population.
The National Guard.
Turning to the National Guard,
Garrison said: "At the present time
Hi is force consists of approximately
129.000 men and officers, and it would
therefore be necessary, if it is to be
expanded to 400,000 men. to add 271,
000 men and officers. We therefore
propose a large addition to the fed
eral aid extended to the National
Guard, so that the system may be op
erated to its maximum capacity and
be available to the federal purposes
specified in its most effective condi
tion."
WILL MAKE OR
BREAK WHITMAN
Albany, N. Y., Jan. 6.—The 1916
legislature will make or break Gover
nor Whitman politically, say the capi
tol's political prophets, who say Whit
man for the last year is not considered
as having been very close to the re
publican organization. Others say the
executive still 'can climb the ladder if
necessary and progressive legislation,
to popular, possibly general, republi
can favor. The governor Intends to
keep in close touch with the legis
lature. He may even adopt President
Wilson's example and personally read
important messages to the senate and
.assembly. Whitman avowedly has his
eyes fixed on the white house.
His budget proposals, said to have
been planned for economy and system
in the state's government, will be
pressed determinedly upon the legisla
tors, Whitman says. One of these is
the civil service reform bill grading
state employes and standardizing their
salaries. Efforts also will be made to
place on the statute books progressive
proposals in the defeated new state
constitution proposed.

Calls Attention to Danger
of Over Production of
Manufacturers.
NO REASON FOR
COMPLAINT NOW
Must be Ready for Radical
Changes in Volume Pric
es and Resources.
New York, 6.—Elbert H. Gary,
chairman of United States Steel
corporation, today Issued a statement
dealing in detail with prevailing pros
perous conditions in the steel and iron
trade, together with a forecast of the
future of that industry. Reference
1b made to the European conflict in
its world-wide application to economic
conditions. Judge Gary calls atten
tion to the dangers of over-production
or inflation by manufacturers and
bankers, resulting from over-confi
denCe, and the aid of the government
is invoked for adequate protection of
the country's Industries. In part, the
statement follows:
No Reason for Complaint.
1
"It will be admitted by all manufac
turers of these products that there is
no reason for complaint at the pres
ent time as to the volume or urgency
of the demand nor, in most cases, the
prices received, notwithstanding the
cost of production has been larger
during the last five years because of
increases in wages and freight charg
es, etc.
"The rate of production at present
in the United States Is about 88,000,
000 tons of pig iron and about 41,000,
000 tons of steel Ingots per annum.
This is compared with a rate of 19,
000,000 tons of pig iron and 16,000,
000 tons of steel Ingots one year ago
and 83,500,000 tons of pig iron and
35,000,000 tons of steel Ingots at high
water mark in the year 1913 for pig
iron and 1912 for ingots.
Could Advance Price.
"Prices could easily be materially
advanced and perhaps will be, al
though I believe as to some of the
.commodities at least, they are high
enough. It is not certain they can
be controlled, for the reason that the
requirements of purchasers, and the
offers they make, fix the prices to a
large extent.
''Apparently about 75 per cent ot
the sales is -for dome.#iclibnS\m»ptJon
and the balance for foreign use, di
rectly or indirectly. The influence of
the export sales upon domestic sales
1 do not undertake to say.
"Conditions pertaining to this in
dustry reflect, more or less, those of
other lines and perhaps are an indi
cation of the general situation. Cer
tainly there are evidences which can-,
not reasonably be questioned of great
prosperity. It is not my purpose to
discuss the reasons for these satisfac
tory conditions. They exist: and It
now seems probable that they may
continue for months to come.
JOFFffPK
Says Boats would Have used
Guns Had Submarine
Made Appearance.
Paris, Jan. 6.—The order of the day
issued by General Joffre, the French
commander-in-chief, to the army on
New Year's day has Just appeared in
an army bulletin.
"Soldiers of the republic," says the
order, "at the moment when this year
of war is terminating, you may con
sider your work with pride, and meas
ure the grandeur of what you have ac
complished. In the Artois, In the
Champagne, in the Woevre and in the
Vosges you have inflicted on the
enemy resounding blows and caused
him sanguinary losses,, losses incom
parably greater than ours. The Ger
man army still holds out, but sees its
numbers and resources diminishing
each day. Obliged to succor weaken
ing Austria, Germany must seek in
secondary theaters temporary and
easy successes that she has failed to
gain on the principal fronts. All the
German colonies are either isolated
from the world or in our hands.
"On the contrary, the Allies are re
inforcing themselves unceasingly. In
contestable masters^ of "the seas.'they
can easily obtain supplies, while the
central empires, financially and econ
omically exhausted, are reduced to
counting only upon our discord or
fatigue. As if the Allies who have
sworn to light to the bitter end were
disposed to violate their oath at the
moment when the hour of chastise
ment was going to strike for Ger
many as- If our soldiers, who have
waged the hardest of combats, were
not of the stuff to hold out In spite of
cold and mud.
"Let us be proud of our might and
our right. Let us think of the past
only to find In it reason for confidence.
Let us think of our dead only to
aven*e them. While our enemies are
talking of peace, let us think only of
war and victory.
"At the becr'nnlng of a year that
will be, thnnks to you, a glc'ous one
for France, your commander-in-chief
Addresses
to you from the bottom of
his heart, the most affectionate greet
ings.

GRAND FORKS, N. D., THURSDAY-EVENING, JANUARY 8, 1816.
IS FOUND DEAD
IN HIS BERTH
Funeral Will be Held Satur
day in Minneapolis—
Was Well Known.
Charles' Rand, president of Rand
Bros. Shoe company of Grand Forks,
died shortly aftter midnight on the
Great Northern tra|n No. 80, between
Fargo and BarneMUe, while return
I lng to his home siffer spending three
days in Grand Fortes with his brother,
William Rand, checking up the year's
business in their local institution.
The remains were taken, on to Min
neapolis, and arrangements were
made there today for funeral services
which will be held Saturday in Lake
wood chapel.
Resident H£rt 188S-101O.
Charles Rand. nfrom 1882 to 1910,
was a resident of Grand Forks, com
ing to the city In the early days with
his brother and establishing the shoe
business, that hasxgrowrf with the city.
Their first store was on the present
site ot the Metropolitan block, being
lij a small wooden structure supported
on piles, the Metropolitan block Bite
once being the basin of a coulee.
Complained of Nausea.
The brothers had been here since
Monday morning, boarding the train
here last evening at about 10 o'clock.
Shortly after leaving Grand Forks,
Charles Rand complained of nausea,
but retired some time later, saying he
felt better.
Charles Rand,-William Rand and J.
D. Bacon were together on the train,
and some time after Charles Rand
had retired, the others found him
dead in his berth, death having come
to him without warning.
Mr. Rand was for several years vice
president of the First National bank
of Grand Forks, and he also was di
rector for several years. Mr. Rand
also served for some years as an offi
cer of the Grand Forks Building &
Loan association.
Mr. Rand was 58 yean old. He
leaves a widow and one daughter.
Miss Mary Rand, *Kovl*lted in Grand
Winnipeg, Man., Jan. 6.—The Man
itoba parliament was convened today
for the first time since the Norris gov
ernment took charge of provincial af
fairs, and for the first time since the
recent election.
With the change in government,
the session gives promise of being un
usually important, with a great many
problems of vital interest to the pro
vince up for consideration.
Since parliament adjourned last, the
situation with respect to the parlia
ment building program has been con
siderably cleared. The charges that
were aired in the last parliament of
extensive frauds in the construction of
the buildings have been admitted
more recently, and they were respon
sible for the change in administration.
I With the approaching vote on the
liquor referendum, it Is expected that
some steps will be taken by parlia
ment to deal with the election. The
province will vote in March, and the
Social Service league has Just renew
ed Its plea that the women be permit
ted to vote at that time. Some time
ago, the Norris cabinet refused to al
low the women to vote, and it is like
ly that a second denial would result
in the matter being brought to the at
tention of parliament.
Another proposition which will
come before parliament is that ot
making changes in the provincial jail
system, which was roundly scored in
a report just filed by Justice Mathers.
The preliminary report covering the
valuation of the buildings at the Man
itoba agricultural college is also like
ly to come in for attention. This re
port showed that the buildings were
being carried on the books at a value
$1,000,000 greater than the actual
value.
Women's suffrage will be early on
the list. The Norris cabinet has pledg
ed the vote of the women, and it will
be granted early. It is not likely that
women will be enfranchised to vote in
dominion elections, the ballot for
them being, confined to provincial
problems only.
SEVERAL SUFFERING
FROM ALCOHOLISM
Tocoma. Wash., Jan. 6.—To care
for ten patients who are suffering as
the result of sudden loss of their
source of liquor supply, owing to the
prohibition law special ward was
fitted at the cc -hospital today.
About twenty otl. persons are wait
ing for admission to the ward.
The sufferers from alsoholism were
segregated, owing to the noise they
made.

Washington, Jan. |.—A live percent
dividend, the first paid by any feder
al reserve bank, has .been declared
by the Richmond bank on Its net
earnings for the period between No
vember S» 1914, and December $1,
1915.' Announcement of the action
was made today by the reserve board.
The dividend goes to member banks
in .-the Richmond district. Several
other reserve banks have more th.n

So far the only actual statement

he thought was the wake of a torpedo.
No submarine was seen at the time.
The absence of further definite ad

Heavy traffic and cold weather
have caused the Great Northern rail
way considerable trouble for the past
few weeks, and In all probability will
continue to do so until the present
cold wave is over. A large number of
students and teachers returning to
their duties after the Christmas vaca

great deal.
Last night No. 30, running from
Grand Forks to St. Paul, left in two

second section three hours later. Both
sections were crowded, and it was
necessary to put several extra sleepers
on both trains.
The Walhalla train, after arriving
at Grafton, was sent to Grand Forks,
and the Grafton-Winnipeg train arriv

The Northern Pacific from St. Paul
to Winnipeg, is not experiencing as
much trouble, as the traffic is consid
erably lighter, although the train
service last night was considerably de
layed on account of the cold snap,
making it hard to keep the regular
