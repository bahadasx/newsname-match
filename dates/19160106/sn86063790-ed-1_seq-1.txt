Ehrhardt, Jan. 4.?The annual

day evening by the Ehrhardt Social
club. in Copeland's hall, was a grand
V.success. The ball room was a scene
of beauty when all the dancers were
full swing. The music (Bearden's

SHOT}) BY NEGRO.
Sam Wilson in Jail at Darlington After
Firing Three Shots.
Darlington, Jan. 3.?Curtis Byrd,
a young white man employed at the
lumber company's plant at Lumber,
in the lower part of the county, was
shot this morning at an early hour by
a negro, Sam Wilson. Mr. Byrd was
shot three times, the weapon used being
a .4 4 calibre revolver. The bull-x
J _ A ~ T"V, /-v
lets were maut; iui <x imc. ? nc
wounded man is in an infirmary at
Florence. The negro has been arrested'and
is in jail here.
It seems that Mr. Byrd left Lumber
this morning on the train from Bennettsville
to Sumter, which passes
Lumber between 7 and and 8 o'clock
for Montclare, to search for a negro
woman who had seriously cut another,
negro on Saturday at Lumber. On
getting to Montclare he located the
woman and went to arrest her. Sam
Wilson, who lived with her, followed
them back to the station. As Mr.
Byrd started back to Lumber with his
prisoner he inquired of Wilson if he
was going with them and received an
affirmative reply. Mr. Byrd told him
to! take the woman's suitcase and
bring it along and to surrender whatever
weapons he had with him. The
negro then drew his revolver and be-gan
firing.
; Immediately after the shooting the
negro fled. He was pursued by Robert
Winters, who succeeded in overtaking
him and arresting him after a
chase of a few hours. The sheriff was
notified in the meantime and arrived
on the scene shortly after the arrest.
. Wilson has told several incoherent
stories of the shooting, at one time)
stating that he did not intend to
shoot Mr. Byrd, and at another that
he did it because he was afraid. He
and the woman arrested early this
morning at Montclare are both in
jail.
?While Mr. Byrd's condition is serious,
hope for his recovery is entertained
by the physicians.

of closing the dispensary, there was
no drunkenness or disorder of any
kind, and no arrest has been heard
of during the week of holiday.
New year's morning the front and
side door of the dispensary had black
bows nailed to same, and a sign suspended
from the awning frame read
as follows: On the side: "Notice?
Dead, but not forgotten," and on the
other .side, "Here lies the remains of
a popular but cursed institution."
Later in the morning a -square
quart bottle filled with vinegar or
colored water, with an empty gun

tied around its neck, was also hung
to the front door.

ASSEMBLY MEETS JAN. II
BOTH HOUSES ORGANIZED AND
READY FOR WORK.
No Indication 011 Eve of Session of
Any Matters of Unusual
Interest. ,
Columbia, Jan. 1.?The second
session of the 71st general assembly
of South Carolina will convene in
Columbia on Tuesday. January 11. at
noon. Both houses are organized and
the preliminaries should consume
very little time. The house will be
called to order by Speaker James A.
Hoyt and the senate by Lieut-Gov.
Andrew J. Bethea or, in his absence,
by Senator Legrand Walker, of
.Georgetown, the president pro tern.
The lieutenant governor went to Europe
with Henry Ford's pacification
expedition, and he- may not get back
until after the opening day of the
session.
The annual message of Governor
Richard I. Manning will probably be
read in both branches on the opening
day. The referring of this message
to the proper pommittees will likely
be all that is accomplished at the
initial meeting.
New Members.
There will be three new members
sworn in by Speaker Hoyt in the
house of representatives. J. Terry
Wood, of Greenville, takes the place
of A. M. Hawkins, who resigned to
devote his time to teaching; R. B.
Belser, of Sumter, will occupy the
seat of George W. Dick, of Sumter,
who resigned to become postmaster of
his native city; R. H. Hicks, of Spartanburg,
succeeds W. G. Querry on
that delegation, Mr. Querry resigning
to accept a position on the State
tax commission.
There will be only one new face in
the senate, from Clarendon county,
succeeding to the seat made vacant
by the death of Louis Appelt, which
occurred after the close of the session
last year.
The resignation of Representative
Dick of Sumter, left vacant the chairmanship
of the ways and means committee
and Speaker Hoyt ajg>ointed
Representative J. T. Liles, of Orangeburg,
to the vacancy.
Nothing Startling.
There are no indications on the
eve of the session of any matters of
unusual interest to come up. There
may be considerable discussion of
proposed amendments apd changes in
the tax commission act, but it is not
believed that any considerable altera
tions will De maae. it nas Deen intimated
that a fight may be made'in
the senate on the confirmation of the
senate on the confirmation of the
tax commissioners, for the act provided
that they should be appointed
by the governor, by and with the consent
of the senate. It has been rumored
that because of opposition of
certain ones to the actions of the
commission in assessing the banks a
fight might be made when they come
up before the senate for confirmation.
The names which will be sent
in by Governor Manning as the members
of the commission are: A. W.
Jones, chairman; J. P. Derham and
W. G. Querry.
Another appointment which will be
submitted to the senate for confirmation
by the governor is that of Dr. C.
Fred Williams as superintendent of
the State Hospital for the Insane.
Warehouse Commissioner.
The most interesting election to be
held by the general assembly will be
that of warehouse commissioner.
John L. McLaurin is the present commissioner
and he will be opposed for
reelection by John J. McMahan, of
Columbia, at present a member of the
delegation from Richland county.
This fight is beginning to attract attention
and may take on considerable
of a political significance before it is
through.
An effort to strengthen the local
option compulsory school attendance
law may be made in the legislature.
Some of the advocates of compulsory
education are not satisfied with the
present act, but want to make it
State-wide immediately. Others propose
to make the change gradually.
One of the recommendations which
will be made by the governor in his
annual message will be the passage
of the Torrens system of land registration,
and there are indications that
Viie mot- dnnp TIip e'nvprnnr will

before a rural credits system can be

London, Jan. 1.?The British liner -.:j
Persia carrying approximately 200
passengers, and a crew of between
250 and 300 mey was sunk by an
unidentified submarine at 1 o'clock
Thursday afternoon off the Island of c . %
Crete, in the Eastern .Mediterranean.

Reports to the Peninsular and Orien- 1
tal Steam Navigation company said |
that nearly all on board were los-t. j
Robert McNeely, of Monroe, N. C., I
American consul at Aden, Arabia, and j
Robert Grant, of Boston, were on the 1
Four boats are known to have got
away from the sinking vessel, each
capable of carrying sixty persons, but, J
it is not known if the boats were hill. '1
The rescued were picked up by a ^ff
steamer bound for Alexandria, wrhere j
they were expected to arrive t^day. .
Peninsular and Oriental Line officials
said they had received no details
concerning the disaster, and did j
not know whether the Persia receiv- ? 38
ed warning. They also were unable
to give any information concerning ' '*
| Americans on the ship.
Consul Skinner Busy.
Every effort is being made by Con- v -8
sul General Robert P. Skinner at Lon-^
don to get some information about yM
Robert X. McNeely and Robert Grant. 1
. ThA British admiraltv informed Mr. - m
i Skinner that "it had no information f
with regard to the fact of individual Jpja
i passengers. A cablegram lias been *
, sent to Alexandria requesting any
' news available regarding the sur- LJ3|
vivors. ,
The Persia sailed from London on j
December 18, for Bombay, with sixtyone
first class passengers and eighty- : .<8
-three cabin passengers, including
eight children. Some of these, including
Edward Rose, a Denver .
school boy, were landed at Gibraltar,
Marseilles and Malta. At .Marseilles
231 passengers, including eighty- .
seven women and twenty-five chil- .
( dren, were taken aboard, btrt jfinfc
officials say that after deducting
those leaving the ship at various
porte of call approximately 2.00 passengers
were on the vessel. -
Mr. McNeely sailed from New York
for England on November 2-7voh the
steamer Ryndam, being a fellow pas
.! senger of Consul uenerai sKinner.
j Mr. Skinner advised him to sail for. i '
the East by the Dutch Line, but the
young man already had engaged pfcs- ?

Says No Warning Given. ^
London, Jan. 2.?The Peninsular ' ;|||
and Oriental Steamship company re- ? d
ceived the following telegram from
Col. C. C. Bigham, who was among,
tthe survivors of the Persia disaster:
"A torpedo struck the ship on the ;; ^9
port bow at 1:05 o'clock in the after- - -18
' if, ' '
noon, when about forty miles south,;
of the east end of the island of Crete, '^> .< j
No "warning was given, nor any at- .
tempt to assist. Within five minufles
the ship had sunk.
"It was impossible to lower the
starboard boats owing to the heavy .
list. Five or six boats were lowered
on the port side. I didn't see this
' J!? ' v J.
1 myself, as I was washed overboard '
j when the boat capsized.
"The conduct of the passengers . \;?|
j and crew was splendid. There was
no struggling and no panic. Four 1; ^
boats, after thirty hours at sea, were
picked up by a warship." .
versified farming and economy wfll
| be among the main points in the govj
ernor's message. He will devote a . j /.
good deal of his remarks to the pub- / '
! lie appropriations. s >'
It is believed that more stringent / %
"* t V
laws ror tne punisnmeni ui viuidiuio ^ ;
j of the prohibition laws will be made
' at this session. Representative Lil6s " ^
J will introduce a measure doing away
with the option of fines and requiring
judges to give straight chain gang
sentences to all persons convicted of \ v "jj
violating the prohibition laws. It '
will be necessary for the general assembly
to provide the governor with ;
a fund for enforcing the law, for the
appropriations heretofore made by
the counties for this purpose came
! out of the dispensary profits and will
: undoubtedly be discontinued.
Rumors that the lawmakers will
devote a big part of their time to
i playing politics are discounted here
i and little credence is given to such
; reports. The general assembly has
J very little reason for playing politics?that
is, any more politics than
is always visible in all lawmaking
bodies. It is believed that the spirit
of harmony and a desire of constructive
legislation for the good of the
State, which was evident throughout
, the last session, will again prevail.
