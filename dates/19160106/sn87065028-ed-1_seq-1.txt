While not entirely unexpected
the death of Mrs. Anna Leigh Short
which occurred at her home, No. 518
College street, soon after five o'clock
yesterday afternoon, brought a feel
ing of sadness to the entire city, for
nearly everyone in Columbus knew
Mrs. Short, and loved her, not only
for her unusually high Christian
character, but for her many noble
deeds. Her long life of more than
four score years hud been devoted
almost entirely to charitable and
eleemosynary work, and countless
Columbians had experienced her
kindly sympathy in times of distress
Mrs. Short had been ill with la
grippe for more than a month, and
while she grew slightly better during
the early part of last week, the im
provement was only temporary, hav
ing proven to be one of those ephem
eral rallies which all too often pre
cedes the visit of the death angel
When death came her two niece
Mrs. T. J. Hagan, of Dallas, Texas
and Mrs. Edwin Finley, of Richmond
Va., and her two nephews, Messrs
W. F. and R. E. Leigh, both of whom
reside in this city, were at her bed
side, and as the mild winter day
merged into the astral night her gen
tle spirit winged its flight across the
Bilent river to find its last resting
place in Heaven.
Probably no woman in Columbus
had devoted so much of her time tc
altruistic work as Mrs. Short. She
had reared three sets of omhan rhU-1
v ren, ana ner whole life carried out
the precept of the inspired poet, who
said:
"Life for those who love you,
And for your Savior, too;
For the wrong that needs resistance,
For the cause that needs assistance,
For the future in the distance,
And for the good that you can do.''
The funeral will take place at the
First Methodist church this after
noon, being conducted by the pastor
Rev. W. L. Duren.
Mrs. W. D. Humphries Diet.
A large concourse of friends at
tended the solemn funeral service
of Mrs. W. D. Humphries at the First
Presbyterian church Monday after
noon at 3 o clock, conducted by Dr.
R. B. Eggleston. Many handsome
floral offerings attested to the love
and esteem in which she was held.
Mrs. Humphries, who was the no
ble wife of Col. W. D. Humphries,
had been an invalid for many years
and her death came as a relief to her
great suffering. She was one of the
most prominent and cultured women
Columbus has ever known, and as
long ns her health permitted was
active in both church and social cir
cles. After the funeral services at the
Presbyterian church the remains
were tenderly laid to rest in Friend
ship cemetery, the following friends
acting as pall bearers:
Messrs. W. C. Beard, S. B.
Street, Sr., J. T. Searcy, W. B. Har
rington, G. Y. Banks and J. T. Wood.

The wedding of Mr. Llewelvn E.
Hatchett and Miss Daisy Parker, of
Macon, which was solemnized on last
Saturday night in that city, came as
a great surprise to Mr. Hatchett'?

League.

Mr. Cliff Williams, of Meridian,
prominent manufacturer and presi
dent of the Mississippi Progressive
League, will deliver and address ir. '
Columlius Saturday morning at 11 j
o'clock at the city hall to the citizens
of Lowndes county on the fee sys-
tern and the back tax question, and;
everyone is invited to be present.
"To eliminate the fee system in!
public office in Mississippi, which
has degenerated into a species of
graft." is the subject for discussion
that will be brought up at this meet-j
ing, which has been called at the re
quest of Mr. WiUiams. The move
ment was inaugurated in Meridian
several weeks ago by Mr. Williams
with the organization of the Missis
sippi Progressive League, which has
as its motto: "We stand for the
greatest good to the greatest num
ber; creation and execution of just
laws to all: the material and finan
cial development of Mississippi; the
same treatment to local and foreign
capital and corporations as to local
individuals.
The work of the state revenue
agent over the state in assessing
back taxes resulted in the movement
to eliminate the fee system in Mis
sissippi. During the past several
months back taxes to the amount of
$1,825,000 were levied against cor
porations, firms and individuals in
this city by the state revenue agent.

73 Years.
Hon Hnmson Johnrt. jw?.
"e , T" u KnWn
Ved throuut many states, will
tomorrow celebrate his 101st anniv-
ersary. His natal day will be ob
served without ostentation, and only
members of the immediate family
will be present to enjoy the occasion
I with him.
Notwithstanding his advanced age.
Mr.' Johnston is still hr.le and hearty
and nearly every day is seen on the
business streets of the city. He i.
erect in figure and walks with a firm
and tdastie step, and no one would
ever think that he was more than
"three score years and ton."
He attributes his longevity to the
fact that he
has led an industrious
life, attended to his own affair
and has not meddled with the affair?
of other people. He has been a tem
perate man all of his life. He says
that he has always taken a drink
when he wanted one, but declares
that during his long life he has not
been intoxicated but once, and that
he has taken only one chew of tobac
co and smoked only one cigar.
Mr. Johnston was born in Fred
erick county, Va., January 7, 1 S 1 5 .
At the age of twenty-one he joined
the Richmond hussars. With thic

In 1841 Mr. Johnston came to Co
lumbus, and the remainder of hi
life has been spent here. Upon his
arrival in this city he opened a mer
chant tailoring and gents' furnishing
goods establishment, and remained
in that business for a number of
years.
At the outbreak of the civil war
Mr. Johnston, being an old-time
Whig, remained loyal to the Union
and is now a staunch supporter of
the principles and policies which he
believed to be just and right at that
time.
At the advanced age of 73, Mr.
Johnston organized and built the
Tombigbee Cotton Mill, which is one
of the most important industrial en
terprises in Columbus. In four years
he doubled the capacity of the mill

While Mr. Connor was the favorite

interpretation. True, the incoming

HASTY OPINIONS
In Formal Slatement Declares
that He Will Take Action at
the Earliest Moment.
Washington, January 4.IW

f!10(s regi'.rdin: the destruction of
the Persia, costing the life of Amen
can Consul Neely are laid bare, in
, temperate utterances in the hous!
of congress would bo postponed.
, It is believed that he impressed
' Chairman Stone of the Senate com
mitiee on foreign relations and
Chairman Mood, of the House com
mittee on foreign affairs, with whom
' he consulted this afternoon, with
I what he considered the necessity of
i withholding hasty action and hasty
speech.
i
The conference, it is known, was
of moment. It was of long duration
and neither of the congressmen
would vouchsafe to newspaper men
even a partial explanation. Chairman
Stone declined to reply when asked
directly if he hud suggested to the
president the plan of taking the en
tire situation to the hall of Congress.
i The president in a formal state
meat declared that he would take
action at the earliest possible mo
ment. The intimation was that hi?
action would be postitve -per-hap
.startling. It is said that the presidtnt
rcaclu'd the conclusion that Aih-t-;n.

' tional light, has strayed beyond the
pale of national recognition.

with unabated kor. The action wis
taken by the county solons yeterday
and with the money, which will be
evpended under the direction of the
State Sanitary Live Stock Board, will
be ample to keep the ticks in a sate
of subjection and will enable farmers
and .stock raisers to secure the best
prices for their cattle when they ship
them to market.
While the livestock men succeeded '
in securing an ample appropriation
for the continuation of the campaign
against the cattle ticks, those who
wanted a county demonstrator were
not so fortunate. A large delegation
of citizens went before the supervi
sors Monday, and requested that prg
visions for a demonstrator be made,
but the county solons, after having
given the request due consideration,
decided that they could not grant it.
The delegation went before the so
lons with the endorsement of the
Chamber of Commerce, and was
headed by Prof. K. R. Lloyd, of the
A. and M. College, who is in charge
of the farmers' co-operation work
throughout the state. Prof. Lloyd de
livered a forceful address in which
he told of the splendid results accom
plished by demon straps . in . otfcer .
counties, and urged the necessity of
nn official of this character in Lown

eil the t'tith and wisdom of his re
marks they felt that the depleted
condition of the county cash box did
not warrant the expenditure that the
employment of a demonstrator would
"ctail, and hence reluctantly declined
to grant the request.
The first work to be performed
Monday was the swearing in of the
various officers, Chancery Clerk
Lincoln took the oath of office Sat
urday from Mr. R. J. Gunter, then
circuit clerk, and when Monday came
Mr. Lincoln was the only officer
present who was qualified for this
work. He examined all of the bends,
aw that the officers had qualified
in the necessary amounts and that
the bonds were all right and then h
administered the oath to the follow
