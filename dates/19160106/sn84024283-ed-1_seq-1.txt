an earthquake, accompanied by a very
ftwfrl noise, reeembling loud bnt dis
tant thunder, but more hoarse and
vlbr.itlnir. which was followed In a
few slnutes by the complete satura- j
tloo of the atmosphere with sulphur
ous raporf, causing total darkness.
Tr screams of the frightened in
habitants running to and fro, not
kno-rlng what to do nor where to go,
theories of the fowls and bats of
evei jr species, the cracking of the
tree i falling and the roaring of the
nllppl, the currant of which was
reU'dea a few minutes, owing, as it
is i potted, to the interruption in its
bed. formed a scene truly horrible.
Rrom that time until about sunrise
a M Oiber of lighter shocks occurred,
at hlch time one still more violent

'In
St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Dec. 28.
C. H. C&aebolt. Postmaster of Case
bol, Mo who made a futile attempt
on December 10, to have himself ar
rested by postolllce inspectors after
the police bad been searching for him
since November .17, had his wish
gratified in a measure to-day when
posluHice Inspectors placed him under
surveillance and a warrant charging
bira with emblezzling $699 of post
office money was issued.
When the inspectors found Casebolt
he appeared to be drinking, and did
not appreciate the situation, so the
inspectors left him, after which he
will be locked np.
Inspectors will not tell where Case
bolt is resting.
Casebolt is alleged to have fraudu
lently issued money orders to himself
as postmaster. Ee also is said to have
used these monev orders to pay for
goods purchased for his general etore
at Casebolt.
ANOTHER ACCUSED HIM.
Mont Brakefield of Casebolt wrote
to the police November 17 that his
friend Casebolt had left Casebolt No
vember 8 with "a big bunch of dough"
and had not been heard from. . On
December 3 Brakefield wrote to the
police that he had been making some
long distance inquiries and had learn
ed that Casebolt had been at a whole
sale grocery bonse and at a saloon on
Sixth street.
On December 10, Casebolt, after
sleeping a few hours in the third floor
corridor of the Federal Building, went
into tbe Marshal's office and denounced
himself an embezzler. Depnty Mar
tha! Clooney took him to Chief Post-
v.';t t aV" V -!U. inepo!,iDriwr
told Held bow he had been making
free with the Government's money.
Reid did not like to act on information
furnished by a man who had been
drinking, and besides the bondsmen
were good for any shortage, so he
told Casebolt to go about his business.
An investigation disclosed the short
age and police and inspectora have
been looking for Casebnlt. The vil
lage of Casebolt was named for the
Postmaster.
t. Louis Pot-Dl patch. Imx. 23th.
C. H. Casebolt, Postmaster at Case-
bolt, Mo, who has been sticking
around St. Louis for several weeks in

but op to noon to-day he did not know
it.
When Casebolt was found yeiterday
at tie Haven Ilonoe, lOSNorlli Broad
way, be was in no condition to travel,
so be was left there anfil this morning.

.' HIS CHECKS RETUENFD.
