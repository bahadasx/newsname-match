JEach Day Finds the Russians Claiming Occupation
of Additional Enemy Positions
TO MAKE GAP BETWEEN
Fighting Must Continue for a Considerable Time Yet, But
Upon the Result Will Depend in a Large Measure the
Strategy of Both Sides When Spring Comes Other
Fronts Continue to Maintain a State of Comparative
Quiet Attitude of English Labor Men Toward Con
scription is a Matter of Anxiety.
(" London, Jan. 5, 9.46 p. m. While
the Tjattle on the borders of Bessarabia
is apparently still far from a decision,
each day finds the Russians claiming
' the occupation of additional enemy
positions, and Petrograd believes that
if this process-continues a short time
longer a break must come somewhere
in the lines of the central powers.
;.The whole energy of the Russian
army is being directed to making a
gap between the German armies in the
center and the southern Austrian
forces. The desperate Austrian at
tacks in the region of Kolki are de
signed to .prevent thjs. The fighting
miut continue for a considerable time
yet, but on the result wiil depend in
large measure the strategy of both
aides when spring comes.
The other fronts continue to main
tain a state of comparative quiet.
For England the attitude the labor
men will take regarding conscription
at a great conference to be held in
London tomorrow is a matter of anx
iety. -7. Robert Williams, leader of the
Transport Workers' Federation, de
clared tonight:
"It - is practically assured that the
conference will affirm the rejection of
consc'ription in any form."
-The etory of the Baralong case has
created a wide sensation. A consider
able part of the English press ques
tions the veracity of the witnesses.
The Globe expresses doubt whether
there , is any e)- peraon-as-Laartmiore
Holland and suggests.:
"The next., time Von Bethmann
Hollwcg subordinates invent a witness
they should provide one who is more
convincing."
' There is general expectation that
Germany will express its dissatisfac
tion at Sir Edward Grey's reply by im
mediately instituting reprisals, which
the English fear will take a violent
form.
PREMIER ASQUITH SUBMITS
: COMPULSORY SERVICE BILL
Scene Within the House of Commons
One of the Most Notable in Its His
tory. London, Jan. 5, 10.30 p. m. The
British government today definitely
embarked upon a policy of compul

Asquith submitted to' the house of
commons a bill drafting eligible un
married men to military duty and
championed the measure in a stirring
speech on the necessity of this step
to meet the growing exigencies of the

The scene within the house of com
mons was one of the most notable in
the history of that body with the
benches packed with members, all the
ministerial seats occupied and the gal
lery overflowing.
With the prospect of a keen duel
between thep rime minister and his
former colleague, John A. Simon, over
the momentous issue which caused the
late home secretary's resignation, the
biggest assemblage of commoners
since the outbreak of the war faved
Mr. 'Asquith, when he introduced his
military service bill. Virtually the
only absentees were those who were
debarred from attending by the mil
itary necessities, hese to a man fa
vor compulsion.
There was a feeling of intense in
terest and anxiety over the culmina
tion Of the controversy which has
shaken the country as no other event
since the war began.
Outside the parliament building
great crowds gathered, reflecting the
deep popular Interest . and shouts of
welcome greeted the premier as he
drove up with his wife and daughters.
Officers in uniform occupied seats
among the members and in the gal
leries, giving a distinct khaki color to
the gathering. -, .

CREW TRANSFERRED TO ANCHOR
'' LINER PERUGIA
BOUND FOR NEW YORK
Resou of the Crew of the Greek
Steamer is the Culmination of a
, Ten Days' ' Battle With Continuous
Gales.
New York, Jan. Bv The crew of the
Greek liner Thessaloniki has been
taken off the ship, which has presum
ably been abandoned, according to a
wireless message received today by
the Scandinavian-American line from
Captain Goetsche of the steamer
United States. The message read as
follows:
"Three p. m. received news Anchor
liner Perugia rescues crew of Thes
saloniki. Thank God. We proceed on
our voyage."
The Perugia sailed from Genoa for
New York, clearing from Gibraltar on
December 22. .
Ten Day Battle with Gales.
The rescue of the crew of the Thes
saloniki is the culmination of a ten
day battle with continuous gales by
the crippled . liner. Some days ago
wireless messages stated that the 300
passengers on board the ship had been
taken off by the Patris of the same
line. - -
The transfer ia supposed to have
taken place on Sunday, but since that
time conflicting reports have been re
ceived in regard to the position of
the Patris and the reasons for her
failure, to reach New York. Appar
ently the Patris stood by her crippled
sister ship after the removal of the
passengers In order to render assist
ance to the crew if the captain decided
to abandon the ship. Nothing could
be learned today, however, as to the
whereabouts of the Patris or of the
reason why the crew was transferred
to the Perugia instead of the Greek
liner.
The disconnected and contradictory
wireless messages received from the
time the Thessaloniki first reported
that she was in trouble indicated that
serious trouble had occurred on board
through the determination of the cap
tain to stick to his ship and efforts
made by the crew to force him to
abandon it.
Coast Guard Cutter Sent.
The increasing urgency of the ap
peals for help from the Thessaloniki
caused the United States government
to take a hand in the situation today.
Orders were issued from Washington
to CaptWDyuiwoQdy. commander
oFthfe' coast guard service here, to
send a cutter in search of the liner.
Captain Dunwoody directed the Mo
hawkto put to sea at once and the
Seneca was ordered put in commission
to sail tonight. At the same time the
Scandinavian -American - liner Unjted
States reported that she was nearing
the last position given by the Thes
saloniki and expected to reach her
within a few hours.
Definite News Today. '"
All day today the Greek line offices
were besieged by the relatives and
friends of the passengers and crew of
the missing ship, clamoring for. some
assurance of their safety. The com
pany expressed confidence that ' it
would have definite news by tomor
row morning.
The Thessaloniki was formerly the
City of Vienna. She. was built in 1890
at Belfast and has a registered ton
nage of 4,682 gross.
PURCHASE OF CHESAPEAKE
AND DELAWARE CANAL
Proposed in a Bill Introduced by Sen
ator Saulsbury.
Washington. Jan. 5. Purchase of the
Chesapeake and Delaware canal for
not more than ;z,iuu,uou and the ex
penditure of $5,000,000 in improving
and fortifying it was proposed in a
bill introduced today by Senator
Saulsbury of Delaware.
The bill is based on a recent report
of the secretary of war that a sea level
canal between the Delaware and Ches
apeake 'bays would be of great military
importance.
The canal would permit a force of
submarines to be held at either of the
two bays and used with equal efficiency
in either, the bin relates.
The bill also proposes to appropriate
$480,000 at once for the purpose of
preventing the occupancy of Delaware
bay by warships and transports of an
enemy.
