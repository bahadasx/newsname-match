Real Estate Assessment Fair.
The committee finds that the present
a-ssessment valuation of privately owned
real estate in Washington is fair and
rea sonable. '
The committee holds that there is no
reason for any arbitrary rule of proportionate
contribution for the expenses of
the District by the residents and by the
people of the United States outside the
District.
The correct rule should be, the commlttte
holds, that the responsibility
and taxation of the residents of the j
District be as fixed and certain as the j
responsibility of residents of other |
American cities comparable with |
w ashtngton.
Would End Responsibility.
The payment of such taxes should be
properly assessed against privately
owned taxable property, and with the
payment of those taxes the financial
responsibility of the residents of the
District shouid be concluded.
The report was signed by Senator
Chilton, chaiman of the committee;
Senators Saulsbury and Works, and
Representatives Gard. Rainey and
Cooper.
The committee suggests that an inheritance
tax be imposed in the District
of Columbia.
The report of the committee in full is
as follows: V

ancement of the city, but also its
is a municipal expression of the ;
the sole idea of establishing facts from
which just conclusions of entire honesty,
fair dealing and justice could be
cirawn.
Of the two questions submitted to i
jour committee it first considered the
following, viz., what is "the proper ,
proportion of interest on the funded '
debt which shall be borne by said District
and the United States, respec- !
tively," and now submits the following ,
statement with the reasons upon which 1
its conclusion is based.
We find that the interest on the
funded debt should be paid by moneys '
from the Treasury of the United States ,
and 50 per cent charged to the reve- ,
nues or tne District or Columbia and .
50 per cent charged to the amount ap- J
propriated for the expenses of the
District of Columbia from the moneys
of the United States.
The Funded Debt.
The "funded debt" consists entirely
of 3.65 bonds fso called bechuse of the
rate of interest they bear) of the District
of Columbia at this date to 56,323.000,
and of which $975,408 is paid
yearly, one-half by the revenues of the ,
District of Columbia and one-half by
the moneys of the United States.
The time of payment of this funded
debt extends to the year 1924, but with
an annual appropriation of approximately
5975,408, the debt will be fully
and completely paid a year or two prior
to 1924, and when paid, the District of ]
Columbia will have no other funded
debt.
This funded debt had its origin in the
very extraordinary expenditures for
c-ty improvements, principally the establishing.
grading and paving of
streets and avenues, the construction
of sanitary sewers, the planting of j
trees and generally, the rebuilding and j
re-equipment of the city of Washing- |
ton from a then existing deplorable
condition of utility and sanitation !
a ong the line^of a threat national capital.
which it^vas intended to be and
which destiny it is fulfilling.
These expenses accumulated between
1*71 and 1874 in very large amounts
burdensome upon both the District of
Columbia and its citizens, which bur- 1
den became fully realized and for which \
relief was first sought by the act of
June, 1874, providing, among other
things:
Act of June, 1874. j
'"1 hat a joint select committee shall
be appointed, consisting of two sena- *
tors, to be appointed by the presiding ^
officer of the Senate, and two members
o:' the Housie. to be appointed by the!'
Speaker of the House of Representa- j;
tives, w hose duty it shall be to prepare
a suitable frame of government for the j
District of Columbia, and appropriate
drafts of statutes to be enacted by
Congress for carrying the same into effect,
and report the same to the two
houses, respectively, on the first day of
the next session thereof; and they shall .
also prepare and submit to Congress a ,
statement of the proper proportion of ,
the expenses of said government, or
any branch thereof, including interest
on the funded debt, which should be ,
borne by said District and the United
States, respectively, together with the
rtasons upon which their conclusions !
may be based."
June 23. 1874, the sundry civil act of
that date makes reference to interest
on the funded debt, as follows:
"Ali the above Hums, except so much
thereof as may be paid for interest, as
aforesaid, to be considered and adjusted
hereafter as a part of the proper proportional
sum to be paid by the United
States toward the expenses of the government
of the District of Columbia."
The message of President Grant in
December. 1874. contains the following:
"The act of Congress of June 20, 1874,
contemplates an apportionment between
the United States government
ar.d the District of Columbia in re- :
spect to the payment of the principal
ard interest of the 3.6f> bonds. Therefore
in computing with precision the
bonded debt of the District the aggregate
sums above stated, as respects
3.05 bonds now Issued, the outstanding
certificates of the board of audit and
the unadjusted claims pending before
that board should be reduced to the
extent of the amount to be apportioned
to the United States government in
the manner indicated in the act of
Congress of June 20. 1S74."
Provisions of Early Laws.
The appropriation act of February 1,
1875. contains the following provision:
"That the sum of $182,500 in currency,
or so much thereof as may be necessary,
be, and is hereby, appropriated
for the payment of the interest on the
bonds of the District of Columbia,
known as 3.65 bonds, due on February

PARKERSBURG, W. Va? January 6?
It ia reported here that six lives were
lost when the river packet Kanawha
overturned and sank a few miles below
this city last night. Reports from Gallipolis
set forth that Purser Bert Wolfe
and Steward Lloyd Gee, Watchman
Arthur Beaver and three passengers were j
drow ned. Two of the passengers were i
women. They were Mrs. E. C. Atkinson !
of Rat ine, Ohio, and Mrs. Campbell of !
Pomerov, Ohio.
Among the passengers taken off tlie
boat and brought here on the rescue
train were four Washingtonians. They
were Mr. and Mrs. E. W. Edgarton and
Mr. and Mrs. A. D. Hoblitzell. Among
the others on the rescue train were Mr.
and Mrs. William Burdette of Gallipolis. j
Ohio; Mr. and Mrs. Bert Lawrence of j
Long Bottom, Ohio; E. P. Landon of I
Rcedville, Ohio; E. C. Atkinson, Racine, j
Ohio, and Emerson Wright of Emerson, j
Ohio.
Survivors in Parkersburg.
Japt. Brady M. Berry and sixty-two I
of the passengers and crew arrived !
here early today on a special train sent
out by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
Company to pick up the survivors scattered
along four miles of river front
on the West Virginia side. Qp.pt. Berry
said that while he saw no one in the
water and did not know that any had
been lost, he felt there had been fatalities.
and was waiting for daylight to
return to the scene of the disaster,
where a thorough search would be
made on the West Virginia and Ohio
bhorej of the river.
"We were moving swiftly down
Btream with me noon auoiu 4:^0 o ciock i
last night, with a crew of about forty
men and some twenty passengers oil
board," said Capt. Berry.
"The weather had been bad but about
that time, just as we were approaching
the lower end of the lock wall on the
West Virginia side we were struck by
a severe storm. Ordinarily a light
shines out from the mast on the wall,
but last night there was no light there,
and before we knew what was happening
the fcanawha had struck the
iron pier a little forward of the boilers
and started to s'nk.
Confusion in the Darkness.

very few minutes the men were getting

The lights had gone out within a min- |

great confusion. But we managed to i
get the people on the hurricane deck I
and as the Kanawha turned on her
side kept them moving toward the top
while we were taking them off. The
Kanawha continually turned and when
we finally got the last man ashore he
was clinging to the bottom of the boat,
as she had turned completely over and
was drifting down stream bottom-^:de

time we struck until all were off and

at Little Hocking, Ohio, and was proceeding
down stream when the pier
I was struck, tearing a hig hole in the
side of the vessel. The boat continued
down the river for some distance be|

URGED FOR VACANCY
ON SUPREME BENCH
Messrs. Taft. Lane and Allen
Put Forward by Their
Friends.
The Supreme Court vacancy was the
subject of several conferences at the
White House today, but President Wilson
has done nothing beyond listen to
the recommendations that have been
made to him. He will continue to listen
and read letters and telegrams of
recommendations and suggestions for
some days to come, but would like to
make the nomination as soon as possible.
owing to the crowded business of
the court.
Senators Simmons and Overman called
I to urge the President to, select Justice
W. R. Allen of the supreme court of
that state for the vacancy. They told
the President of the long and honorable
service of Justice Allen on the North
Carolina bench. They also told the
President that it has been many years
since North Carolina was represented
on the bench.
Claims of Fourth Circuit.
North Carolina is in the fourth circuit,
the other states included in the circuit
being South Carolina, Maryland, Virginia
?n^ TCaof VifCTintn ri 1 J -

| been told, and will be told again. that
this circuit has not received recognition
on the supreme bench in such a long time
| the lawyers and judges believe their candidates
should be considered. Every one
!of these states will have candidates in
. the field. Solicitor General Davis of the
I Department of Justice is from West Virginia,
and iooks today to be the strongest
man yet mentioned. Virginia will put
[forward a choice so scon as the senators
land representatives can agree upon a
man.
Representative Montague is talked
of South Carolina will come forward
with Justice C. A. Woods of the supreme
court of that state. His name
was mentioned when Justice McReynolds
was named to the court. It is
understood that the Maryland democrats
will lose little time in presenting
a man from that state. South OaroI'na
is to tell the President that no
South Carolinian has been placed on the
Supreme Court bench since 1804; Virginia
will have a somewhat similar
tale of woe. and West Virginia will
claim that that commonwealth has
never been represented on the court.
Senator Newlands Sees President.
Senator Newlands of Nevada saw the
President today. He said he believed
that if the nomination wrent to a democrat
it should go to Secretary Lane of
California, not only because of his legal
learning, but because of his wide
knowledge of transportation and commercial
problems in the country. "As
a member of the interstate commerce
commission Mr. Lane was statesman,
jurist and administrator," said Senator
Xewland. 1
If for any reason Mr. Lane's nomina- '
tion was not advisable. Senator New- 1
lands hoped, he said, the President 1
would select former President William s
H. Taft. 1
"His pre-eminent fitness is conceded," <
said Senator Xewlands; "and his po- 1
litical independence and tolerance in
the appointment of a southern demo- i
crat to the chief justiceship and of two '<
other southern democrats as associate justices
should be emulated. The south
should give unanimous support to such <
a movement in his behalf and should t
not permit itself to be drawn into a 1
contest for local candidates. The feel- 1
ing of respect and effection for Taft is >
increasing every day, and I do not be- ?
lieve the President could do anything *
more acceptable to the coi^ntry than <
make this appointment," * *

FOR PERSIA FACTS
Austrian Foreign Office Has
Not Replied to Ambassador

Ambassador Penfield cabled to-j
(lay "lie had presented informally j
to the Vienna foreign office the
American government's request ;
for any inforrpation on the dei
struction of ' the British liner
Persia, and at the time of filing
his dispatch had received no j
reply.
American Consul Carrels at,
Alexandria reported that the affidavits
he has gathered from the
Persia survivors give no more
proofs that a submarine tor- '
pedoed the liner, or regarding its
nationality, than were contained
in his first dispatches.
All Seeking Information.
I (
Ambassador Penfleld was instructed
to ask the Austrian government informally
for any information it might <
have on the Persia which would de- ,
velop the facts in the case and help
the American government decide how
the liner was destroyed. Consul Garrels ?
was instructed to get affidavits for the (
same purpose. |
So far the only actual statement
tending :o prove that the ship was torpedoed
came from one of the officers of
the shif. He said he saw what he
thought was the wake of a torpedo. No
submarine was seen at any time.
Further dispatches from Ambassador
Penfleld are expected at the State Department,
probably late today, and at
any event tomorrow. Meanwhile other
consular agents along the Mediterranean
coast are, like Consul Gar- ]

The absence of further definite advices
is holding the situation, so #?r as
any action by the United States is I

! Chairman Stone of the Senate foreign i
[relations committee discussed the situation
with the President today and
talked of other questions expected to'
come up at a meeting of the committee '
tomorrow, particularly Senator Fall's J1
resolution for information 011 the rec- ^
ognition of the Carranza government t
and information on the Mexican ques- 1
tion. t c
The President told Senator Stone no
additional information of importance t
had Peen received on the Persia inci- \
dent, and expressed the hope that until i
the government had formulated its pol- n
icy there be as little discussion as pos- s
sible in the Senate. x
Senators Simmons and Overman of e
North Carolina asked President Wilson
today if any further information about
the death of Consul McNeely had been

TO SECONDARY LINE
Russians Said to Have Pierced Teutonic
Positions in Vicinity
of Czernowitz.
FATE OF TOWN IS IN DOUBT
Fall Before Czar's Advance Expected
to Have Important Influence
in Swaying
Rumania.
LONDON. January 6.?The
Times learns from its Pelrograd
correspondent that the Russians
have pierced the enemy's positions
in the immediate vicinity of
Czernowitz. compelling their opponents
to fall back to their secondary
line and definitely assume
the defensive. The dispatch,
dated Wednesday. sa\ s that the
enemy's losses have been enormous
in these engagements and
also in the neighborhood of
Czartorysk, where he was pressed
back westward for several miles.
While the fate of Czernowitz
itself is obscured in conflicting reports.
it appears evident that the
Russians dominate the Bukowina
rapilal. Unofficial dispatches from
Petrograd state that the Austrians
have evacuated the town
under pressure from the Russians
holding the heights above it.
while from Austrian sources the
information has been received
that the Austrian troops have
been withdrawn from a portion
of the city.
Unable to Break Line. Is Claim.
After prolonged artillery fire the
Russians attacked again along the
ront in Ualicia and Bukowina. but
cere nowhere able to break the Ausrian
linos, according to the statement
>y the Austro-Hungarian war office reel
ved here today.
Czernowitz lies in a deep valley. The
own itself is not of great strategical
alue. except for its railroads, its fall
s likely to have greater political than
ailitary significance, as an outstanding:
uccess by the Russians at this time
rould be likely to have a far-reaching
ffect on Rumania.
Fighting of Fierce Character.
A dispatch to a Berlin newspaper
roin the Bukowina front describes the
ighting there since Christmas day as
inexampled. The Russians have conentrated
over 200 guns and three diisions
of infantry on a front of threeuarters
of a mile. The battle reached
ts height December 28. when the Kusian3
attacked fourteen times, and
here was furious hand-to-hand fightng
The Times I'etrograd correspondent,
elegraphing Tuesday, says, in the
pinion of the military critics there,
he approach of the Russians to the
ailway line running from Salestchitkv
o Czernowitz has greatly lessened the
a.lue of the former point for the Auirians.
May Have Cut Railway.
"It is quite possible," the correspond
nt adds, "that the Russian cavalry
as cut the line, but there is no conrmation
of the report that we have
ccupied Czernowitz. which in itself is
ot a tempting bait for either belligrent.
The preponderant importance
he enemy attached to the possession
f the Styr river is reflected in th?'
erman army orders where the river
i described as the of the south
nd the permanent .%ure of which

hores were converted into an unroken

"In view of the enormous strength of
le enemy's fortified lines in the southrn
theater, the military critics warn
le public against pitching their hope*
