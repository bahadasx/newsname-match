The Turks are said to have con

from Damascus through Jerusalem (A)

Xew York, Jan. 0. From the view
point of Wall street, the renewed break
jiu Industrial issues today especially in
war stocks was attributed to the pub
lished Gary Interview concerning the
financial and industrial future. His
judgment, however, (toes not appear to
differ greatly from the consensus of ex
pert forecasts, already published nt the
year-end. Virtually all of these warn-
ou against tho possibility of overdoin
traiio expansion insofar ns it is base
on war material.
Tho break wus helped, too, by the
fact one war company announced a 20
jier cent dividend, whereas more had
been prophecleil. Even steel- shures
yielded sharply despite conditions of
the trade and announcement of a wage
increase.
The extraordinary contrasting move
ment in English and Gorman exchange
continued, sterling reached 4.7fJ 1-2,
more tliuii a cent above yesterday's
and the highest since July. This was
ascribed to largo sales of American
securities by London, Hut since there
has been equally hci.ry selling before

to suppose that the proceeds of the
recent .r0l),000,000 loan and the skill
ful employment of the special bankers'
credit is nt Inst having Its anticipated
influence.

Ho declared a large standing army
is not only undorsirablo. but also "ut
terly futilo," while he termed relianco
on tho militia as "uttorly unwarrant

tion." Tis continental army plan, he
held to be the only feaaiblo alternative
if compulsory training and conscrip
tion are to bo avoided.
If you adopt a system based on vol
untary action, as is tho continental
army plnn, and that fails, then policies
based on universal service or some lonn
of compulsory service will bo enacted

lureu.
Thereupon ho rend a long statement

tion $500,000,00 annually. .
"It ii also impossible under present
conditions," ho said, "to enlist over
50,000 men each year, iurthor, in a
democracy, the defense of the nation
should rest upon its citizens and not
upon a professional paid force."
As for the militia, he suggested that
federalizing it is impossible because the
government lucks such authority. He
disapproved tho federal militia pay bill
and recommended thut the militia be
given the right to enter the continental
army, "grade for grudo."
"Thus," ho continued, "free discre
tion and choice would bo given the mil
itiamen to stay in the militia, which
will be conserved and built up on an
even more liberal scnlo than at present,
or to enter the continentnl army with
out a lower rank than they now have."
Would Not Injure Militia.
The secretary denied that the conti
nental army plan would injuro the mili
tia. He said tho continental plan calls for
recruiting men from privato military
schools and high schools us well ns
from the rank ami 1 lie of tho nation.

Concerning tho idea of invoking the
Swiss or Australian system of universal

" Neither is believed to be practica
ble nt this time. Tho national govern
ment has no jurisdiction over the public
school systems of tho states, and hence
a constitutional amendment would be
required to introduco such a program.
Furthermore, it is not believed thnt the

Copenhagen, Jan. 0. Sweden does
not inctnd to let Germany lose the war
struggle, even if Sweden is forced to
join the central powers to prevent such
ix conclusion.
She may not insist on an out and
out German victory, but bIio feels thnt,
for her own safety, she cannot allow
tho Russians to beat Gerninnv, Sweden
is not particularly pro-German, nnd yot
she is now pro-ally, but she is anti-ltus-siun

Washington, Jan. 6. A dispatch to

Alexandria indicated that tho govern
ment now lias all the information on
the sinking of tho liner Persia that it
is likely to obtain, except from Vien

Lqndon, Jan. 0. Labor leaders dealt
today a heavy blow against conscrip
tion. Tho executive committee of the
national labor congress presented! to)
that body in tho uamo of 3,000,000
trados unionists a resolution In protest
against tho government's compulsorj
servico plans.
Cries of approval greeted the commit
tee document which expressed regret
that the "nation's solidarity had been
gravely imperiled and industrial and
political liberty menaced by the atti
tude of the conscriptionists."
Nine hundred delegates, representing;
400 organizations, including the most
powerful of England's labor bodies,
were present. A majority of them wer
outspoken against any form of con
scription. Ono group even demanded
that Arthur Henderson, labor member
of the cabinet, resign.
Harry Gosling, president, and a num
ber of labor members of parliament
wore present.
Preceding Introduction of the resolu
tion, the executive committee reported
"labor's doep-rootod, traditional and
uncompromising; hostility to conscrip
tion." --
"This hostility cannot be outraged
with impunity," snid the committee
chairman amid wild applause, "and
especmially since tho wngo earners hove
voluntoered with such splendid chiv
alry. The eyes of the nation is centered
on tho congress. It is expected that
the delegates will pass the resolution.
though th government hopes that strong;
loaders will opposo it nnd win many
over to their way of thinking.
That the congress will condemn
conscription was indicated by a test
vote on a motion to support a modified
conscription plan which would draft
ainglo men who had not volunteered
undor tne Derby pinn. The motion
covered the same persons as the A
quith bill, except for tho widowers.
This was defeated by 2,121,000 to 5-11,-000
according to ballots representing
thoso numbers of workers and cast by
tho latter 's delegates.
The Wows today viowod tho conscrip
tion situation with pessimism, predict
ing not only that labor member Hender
son will quit the cabinet but likewise)
thnt tho insuo will forco a grave domes
tic crisis leading to a general election
within a fow weeks and resulting in
formation of a conservative ministry
of which Lloyd Georgo will be a mem
ber. This paper declared that tho pres
ent cabinet lacks vitality.
The Mail declared tho government
is facing the greatest internal erisiw
of tho war. Tho Chronicle, Kxpress and
Post attacked tho bill, but the Times
and Telegraph supports it.
The general viow horo is that uesmtn
tho opposition of laborites and Irish
members, parliament will pass the bill.
A preliminary test voto was slated
today.
