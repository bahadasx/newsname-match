C^EMIDJI BOY RECEIVES
^RST PRIZE ON STORY
OP FARM SUCCESSES
-f************
NoteDon Shannon, 22, liv
ing three miles southwest of Be
midji, was awarded first prize
by "The Farmer" magazine for
an article on "Lessons Learned
in the School of Experience."
Hundreds of readers of The
Farmer analyzed their successes
and failures of farming during
1915 and discussed the needs of
drainage, diversification, and
silos were emphasized. It is,
indeed, an honor for a Beltrami
boy to secure the first award.
The following is the article. It
is entitled, "Conquering a Sandy
Farm."Editor.
(By Don Shannon.)
The first of April, 1915, I rented
my father's farm three miles from
Bemidji, on the upper Mississippi
river, in the cut-over country. It con
tained 126 acres of light sandy soil,
22 acres under cultivation, most of
which had been well fertilized, and
was in fairly good tilth, and 3 1-2
acres of river-bottom hay land. My
father is a railroad man, living on
the farm and driving to and from
his work. There were three milk
cows, one heifer and a team of horses.
Since there was not enough stock
to provide a living, I decided to do
some market gardening. I had
worked during February and March
making hot-beds for a gardener near
St. Paul so I immediately made a
hoi-bed, in which I grew early cab
bages, tomatoes, radishes and let
tuce. This turned out a complete
success. I got sale for my surplus
cabbage and tomato plants, and got
a small quantity of radishes and let
tuce on the Bemidji market before
the gardens had commenced to pro
duce. Before the summer was over,
I wished I had everything under
glass. Every small farm should
have a hot-bed.
I cropped the farm as follows:
Spring rye, 4 acres corn, 11 acres
(including 1 1-2 acres sweet corn)
beans, 3 acres one-half acre pota
toes one-half acre rutabages, and
one-half acre garden truck. You
will notice a comparatively large
acreage of corn, but on our sandy
soil that is well fertilized we raise
excellent corn,. Minnesota
Np,_13te
No. 23 and various flint varieties.
The first thing I found out when I
started was that 2 1-2 acres clover
of last year's seeding had winter
killed. Next time I will seed timo
thy in it. Some of my neighbors
would rather have all clover, and
plow it under if it winter-kills but
that is not always convenient when
you have your work planned ahead.
We have learned to study our soil
more each year. In the four years
we have been here, we have seen a
majority of failures of oats on light
sandy soil, last year being an excep
tion. Even on well manured ground
the hot weather in July dries out the
soil. One year, we all seeded our
oats late, when the wet weather of
the spring was over, the roots would
grow downward for moisture and so
be in good position to get moisture
in July, but as is usual with late
sown oats, they rusted. So we have
come to regard winter rye as the best
substitute, for no case is on record
of the failure of winter rye. It even
withstood the winter of 1914-15.
Another crop we are boosting for
our sandy soil is white navy beans.
I planted mine in rows, 30 inches
apart and three to a hill, six inches
apart in the row. In spite of nu
merous frosts, they made a fair yield.
We have learned, however, that we
must have machinery for growing
them on a large scale. The grain
drill does for planting, and we have
a harvester and picker, but no bean
puller. It is heart-breaking work to
thresh them with a flail, and about
one month of such work would rob
a person of all ambition.
We have a pasture problem. The
ground under the jack pines is cov
ered with needles, and there no grass
grows. However, we are seeding
bluegrass and timothy in our clear
ings. A forest fire ran through our
woods early in the season, and there
grass sprung upi, which furnished
excellent pasture, so in the future
we will burn all our slashings. Win
ter rye comes in handy for pasture.
Our cows were dry during the late
fall, and we fed very little feed up

to November 1, when they calved,
and they were in excellent condi
tion. This is a great help, for the
feeding season is long. In this con
nection I find the winter dairy best.
The cows are dry on pasture, and
oalves make good growth on dry
feed.
Then, too, we have a hay prob
lem. Cutting wild hay with a scythe
scarcely pays, and the bottoms are
very wet until late summer. We have
a judicial ditch under way which
will drain a wiregrass slough of
ours. This will give us some good
alsike and redtop meadow. With
the help of more rented land and
new breaking, I expect to seed in
more clover. This will make pos
sible a good rotation, which we
surely need to keep a light soil in
shape.
I had some experience with frost
this year. I put brush piles along
one side of the beans and kept watch
for early frosts. On the night of
August 26, I got up at twelve the
sky "was cloudy and a breeze was
blowing. I got up again, at 3:45 a.
m. and it was 36 degrees. I thought
it must be as cold as it could get,
so close to morning, or else that jt
had already frosted between 12:00
and 3:45, so I went back to bed.
When I got up in the morning, it had
frosted. It was the most disap-

ENGINEER URGES
CLUBS TO WORK
FOR NEW HIGHWAY
Concerted Action for Jefferson Road
is Asked of Commercial
Organizations.
NEW ORLEANS-WINNIPEG ROAD TO BE READY IN 1917
Road From Bemidji Will Connect at
St. Vincent With Canadian
Division.
St. Paul, Minn., Jan. 6.Concerted
action by all commercial clubs along
the route of the Jefferson highway
through Minnesota-% is asked by
George W. Cooley, state engineer of
the Minnesota highway commission,
in a letter sent toda,y.
Mr. Cooley's letter ^follows designa
tion of the route through the state
by the commission. He asks the
clubs to appoint committees to carry
on the work of creating favorable
sentiment for the Jefferson highway
and assist in the improvement of the
route and suggests the banding to
gether of the committees in a large
state organization la|er.
Road Ready in 1917.
The engineer sets in end of 1917
as the time when the. route probably
will be marked out through the state
and put in good shage.
Power was given 1 the Minnesota
highway commission'at the meeting
in New Orleans, at which the Jef
ferson highway association was
formed, to select the route of the
new road from the ./Twin Cities to
Winnipeg. Of the i,800 miles be
tween New Orleans and the Cana
dian city, 500 miles'of the highway
will be in Minnesota.
Enters State at /4bert Lea.
The road will enter the state at
Albert Lea, over what is known as
the Capital National highway, and
travelers will proceed to the Twin
Cities through A watoimaV. Faribault,
Northfield and Farmington. The
commission picked ojv the following
fl)ti# to ^innip^g:^Tl6'u^ir' USseor
to Anoka to Elk River thence north
on the east side of the Mississippi
river to Little Falls northwest to
Staples in Todd county west and
north through Wadena and Park
Rapids to the source of the Missis
sippi in Itasca state park thence
northeast to Bemidji.
Engineers to Make Examinations.
At this point matters- will be held
in abeyance until engineers have an
opportunity to pick advantageous
route to St. Vincent, where the
highway will connect with the Cana
dian division. From Bemidji to St.
Vincent there is 150 miles of old lake

IN THIS COUNTYBarbers
Sentiment Growing in Favor of Put
ting Liquor Issue to
Voter.
SOUTHERN PART NOW
"DRY" UNDER TREATY
Baudette and Spooner Are Only Big
"Wet" Points in the
County.
As a result of the granting of a
saloon license at Kelliher by the vil
lage council, sentiment favoring an
election under the county option law
in Beltrami county appears to -be
growing stronger. Unless all signs
fail the question will probably be
submitted to the people before the
close of 1916.
People in all parts of the county
are becoming more and more in fa
vor of settling the liquor question
in this county by the option law.
The Blackduck American in an ar
ticle says that the sentiment in the
north against option is not nearly so
strong as the people in the south
end of the county have been led to
believe. Men of prominence not only
in the border villages of Baudette
and Spooner but throughout the en
tire county, who for various reasons
do not care to take the initiative,
are eagerly hoping to have the ques
tion brought before the voters in the
belief that then this county will be
placed in the dry column.
The only places of importance in
the county outside of the treaty dis
trict, where liquor is being legally
sold are at Baudette and Spooner.
Objection has been raisel by the li
quor interests in these villages on
the ground that it would be unfair
to them to allow the southern end
of the county which is closed by the
Indian treaty to vote on the question
affecting those towns.
