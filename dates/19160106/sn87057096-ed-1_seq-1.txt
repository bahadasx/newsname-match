/Last Friday night J. A. Keeran,
lives on Route No. 2, had an
unusual experience with a hungry
wolf. Mr. Keeran recently butcher
ed a big hog and was keeping the
meat in a barrel outside the house
over which was placed a galvanized
tub as a cover. About 11:30 o'clock
Mrs. Keeran heard a noise outside
the house and awakened her hus
band and told him someone was after
their meat. He started to dress, but
Mrs. Keeran secured alight and went
outside first. The barrel was over
turned and a big ham was missing.
Mr. Keeran followed the tracks of a
wolf out from the house a short dis
tance and found the ham partly eat
en. He- picked it up and took it
into the house, and a few minutes
later went out to fix up the meat bar
rel when he discovered that the wolf
had returned the second Jjme and
carried away a whole side of the
meat. He'certainly was a pretty
nervy fellow to make the second at
tack.
Paid $28,500 for a Decatur County
Farm.
T. U. McCrystal, of Des Moines,
who formerly resided near Decatur
City, has purchased the 285 acre
farm northwest of Leon known as
the George T. Ogilvie farm from
Charles H. Richardson, of Brush,
Colorado, at $100 "per acre. The sale
was made by Keller & Robertson, of
Leon, and Robert Bennie, of Creston.
Mr. McCrystal is well posted on farm
values in this county, and thinks he
secured a bargain in this farm at the
price. And just as an illustration as
to how Decatur county farm lands
ere advancing in price, we will state
that when Mr. Ogilvie came here
ft om Illinois and purchased this farm
in 1900, he bought it for $36 an acre.
Boxing Match Was Stopped.
The boxing match which was
scheduled to be pulled off at the
opera house on last Wednesday ev
ening did not take place, as county
attorney Geo. W. Baker stepped in
and informed the promoters that it
was contrary to law and would not
be permitted. The boxers were here
and there was a fair sized crowd
present, and the boys put up a little
exhibition to which no admission was
charged. Manager Jap Carr was out
at least $150 in bringing the boxers
to Leon, but took His loss good natur
edly and says he is coming back here
to put on some good wrestling match
es in the near future.

LEON'S SHORT COURSE
Is Being Held This Week, and Those
Attending are Very Enthuslas
tic and Well Pleased,
The first short course held in Leon
opened Monday and the attendance is
pretty good, although not sp large as
it should be. The special exhibit
train of three cars arrived Saturday
evening and are located on the side
tracK near the passenger station aiid
are open to visitors at all times. One
of the cars 1b an Arms palace horse
car in which are carried three fine
Belgian horses from the farm of R.
E. French, of Independence, Iowa,
which weigh over a ton each and are
said to be the best in Iowa, if not
in America. They are used for dem
onstration purposes and have At
tracted considerable attention.
The short course meetings are held
at different places, the meetings ai)d
exhibits in the grain and soil depart
ment being held in the big Mullinnix
building. About fifty ^samples of
qorn are shown and the men .in
charge of the short course say it is
by far the largest and best exhibit
of corn they have had at any sh0rt
course this winter. I
The big implement house of E. jW.
Hamilton was secured for the live
stock exhibit which will be held the
latter part of the course, the floor
being covered wjth saw dust ahd
raised seats arranged for those who
attend so that all can see.
The Home Economics course is
held at the assembly room of the
library building and it is being well
attended, close to forty ladies being
enrolled for-the course and they are
mightily interested in the work. Mrs.
Roy Gammon and Mrs.' Everett Wat
ers, whose names did not appear on
the program through an error, are in
charge of the exhibit in this depart
ment and they have been working
like Trojans and to them much cred
it is tue for the success of this de-,
partment.
In the evening the meetings are
held at the opera 'house and good
crowds have attended, the programs
as published in this paper last week
being carried out. Tuesday evening
Raymond Hazlet, the thirteen year
old boy who won the free trip to the
California expositions for the raising
the best acre of corn in the boys'
contest, gave a Very interesting de
scription of his trip to California and
what he saw on it, which was greatly
enjoyed by the audience. A special
feature for Friday-evening a an old
fashioned spelling match.
The' iorr, exhibits were judged
terday r.tternoon and the judging of
th« other exhibits will follow later,
and tlie results will be given next
week.
Thre are eight people from the
State College at Ames here, conduct
ing the short course, George Dunlop,
having charge of small grains and
corn, assisted by F. C. Fenton, who
in addition has charge of the farm
buildings and silo department. H.
B. Hart is in charge of the live stock
department, being assisted by P.
c:
Tomlinson, and E. H. Houser is in
charge of the live stock exhibit which
is carried on the special train. R. W.
Reep has charge of the exhibit cars.
Miss Mabel C. Bentley is director of
the Home Economics and Domestic
Science department, being assisted
by Miss Maud Donahue.
Those who are attending the
short course are very enthusiastic
about it, and say they are getting a
great deal of good out of it, and it
is to be regretted that the attendance
is not larger, the total number enroll
ed being between 100 and 125 when
at least three hundred should be en
rolled.
In this connection we believe the
people at the State College at Ames,
who are conducting the short course
work, have made a mistake. The
Commercial Club and others were
anxious that a short course be held
at Leon, and the committee appoint
ed to carry on the work have worked
hard, but it was uphill business, /or
the average business man knows but
little about short course work, or
how to go at it to get the best results.
If a competent man, thoroughly
familiar with all the details of the
organization had been sent to Leon
for a solid week he could have ac
complished more than the local par
ties could expect to do in months.
The work here has lacked organiza
tion and effectiveness, simply because
those doing the work did not know
and had no means of finding out
just what to do. If another short
course is held here, it will probably
be looked after in an entirely differ
ent manner, but believe us, the men
and ladies too, who have served on
the local committees do not think
it is any snap.
Stock Show Saturday.
There will be a stock show Satur
day, Jan. 8, at the close of the Short
Course, now going on at Leon.
There will be classes for brood
mares, yearling horses and mare
colts, weanling horse and mare colts,
bull calves, heifer calves, any beef
breed, dairy cows any breed. See
premium list for prizes.
An entrance fee of 50 cents will be
charged. All stock except brood
mares and dairy-cows must be the
get of registered sire.
The judging will commence at 10
a. Saturday morning. All the
beef and dairy cattle entries muBt be
in by 10 a. m. Saturday and all the
hordes must be in by 12 o'clock noon
Saturday.
Everyone who: intends to exhibit
live stock should keep these an
nouncements in mind.

New Law for Pensioning Blind Per-
The new law providing far" their
ect
pensioning of blind went Into effect
on January 1, 1916.
The law provides that any man, 20
years old or over, or woman eighteen
years or over, who is blind and is not
an inmate of a charitable institution,
or who has an income of less than
$300 a year, is eligible to a pension
to be paid by the county. The amount
of the pension is |150. The appli
cant must have lived in the state five
years and in the county one year.
Under the phrasing of the law, the
examining physician will make ex
aminations the first week in January
only, so that those who contemplate
taking advantage of the pension act
must file their application and be ex
amined during that week.
Under the terms of the law an ap
plicant for a pension must first go to
the district court clerk's office in the
prpsence of two witnesses who will
swear that the applicant is eligible.
On or before January 15, these affi
davits are certified to the board of
supervisors.
Board of Supervisors in Session.
The board of supervisors met in

whose term expired with the close of
the year. J. H. Hill, of Decatur, was
chosen as chairman for this year.
The board selected The Leon Re

Lamoni Chronicle as the official pa

but three applications on file.
There was quite "a number of appli
cations for the position of county
bridge foreman, but the board re
elected F. L. Barrett as foreman. Mr.
Barrett has given excellent satisfac
tion in this,position, and is familiar
with, the work. He is a splendid
workman, and the county bridge busi

hands.

Kratzer Carriage Co., of Des Moines.

others will follow.

The storm on New Year's day ser
iously interfered with the trains on
both
our roads. The passenger train
due here on Thursday afternoon on
the D. M. in K. C. did not arrive until
Saturday morning when the road
was cleared, and the south bound
passenger on the St. Joe branch of
the "Q" did not reach St. Joe until
Saturday, being delayed by the en
gine leaving the track while bucking
snow, and a snow plow which was
sent out to assist them was also ditch

braneous croup.
A party of young folks started for
John Wasson's home in Morgan
township last Saturday afternoon in
a big bob sled with four horses. They
intended when they left Leon to re
turn that evening, but owing to cir
cumstances over which they claim
they had no control, they did not get
back home until Sunday morning
about eight o'clock. It seems they
lost the road and could not find out
where they were. They stopped at a
farm house and inquired the way,
and after being informed, started on,
but after driving for an hour, or so
found themselves back at the same
house again. If that crowd ever
starts to find the way to Wasson's
again it will be when the flowers are
in bloom and the moon is shining
bright.

Two Fires at Davis City.
Davis City is starting the new
year off well in the way of fires, hav
ing had two this week. Monday
morning the barn of Riley Hullinger
was destroyed by a fire which was
discovered about 4 o'clock, and the
barn and all the contents were de
stroyed. The origin of the fire is
unknown, but it is thought some one
who had been sleeping in the barn
accidentally dropped a match. There
was no live stock in the barn but a
couple of tons of hay, 150 bushels
of corn, 40. or 50 bushels of oats,
harness, rigs and considerable other
property was burned. Mr. Hullin
ger haa $300 insurance on the barn
and $500 on the contents, but his
loss will be considerable.
Tuesday morning about 2:30
o'clock, the Zika Bros, cafe was de
stroyed by fire, and it was only by
the hardest kind of work that the
adjoining buildings were saved, 'xue
Zika boys were sleeping in the res
taurant, and the fire had made such
progress that they barely escaped
with their lives, nothing being saved
from the building. Fortunately they
carried insurance of $2,800 on their
stock. The building was owned by
F. M. Freeman, who had $500 insur
ance, but his loss will be considerable
above this.
Shipped a Lot of Poultry.
During the month of December the
poultry plant of Aaron & Co. in Leon
shipped a total of 250,000 pounds of
dressed poultry to eastern markets.
Just think of it, a quarter of a mil
lion pounds. Manager Manning in
forms us that their business since
their new plant was opened has more
than exceeded their anticipations
and he is well pleased with the busi
ness which they did the past year.
Aaron & Co. have invested a good
many thousand dollars in their new
poultry plant in this city. They have
one of the finest plants in the state
and give employment to a conisder
able number of people. The poultry
plant is a mighty good business as
set for the city of Leon.

molished.
Mr.* Agile Carlan and Miss Flor
ence Harless of Weldon were injured
rather seriously last Saturday even
ing when the car they were driv
ing turned turtle on the grade cross
ing by the farm of Tom Norton,
three miles south of town. The car
they were riding in belonged to Mt.
Tillotson, the station agent at Wel
don. It is understood that the car
was taken without the owner's per
mission.
Carlan,. with Miss Harless at his
side, was running the car, a Ford, at
a high rate of speed and evidently
wanted to see how fast he could go
over the grade crossing—and he saw.
The car turned over about three
times and was wrecked. Miss Har
less had her ankle badly sprained
and her side injured. She suffered &
few cuts and bruises over her arms
and face. Carlan received three
broken ribs and was shaken and
bruised badly. It is fortunate that
they did not lose their lives.—Osce
