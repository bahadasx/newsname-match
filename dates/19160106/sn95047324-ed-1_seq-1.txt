Resolutions by the DeSoto County
Association
ADOPTED AT THE
RECENT MEETING
Raise the Rate for Political An
nouncements the Old Officers
are Re-Elected for Another
Year.
", The DeSoto County Press As
sociation met here Friday in the
parlors of Hotel Punta Gorda.
Several - members were absent,
but quite an interesting session
resulted. .
The following resolutions were
unanimously adopted, with the re
quest that they be published in
the papers of South Florida :
"Resolved, That this Associa
tion urge the South Florida Press
Association at its coming meeting
at Bartow, and likewise the
State Press Association at its
next regular annual meeting, to
adopt the following rules and
regulations governing the Asso
ciations: "That the membership of these
Associations be restricted to per
sons actually engaged in newspa
per work, and that the business
of the Associations be restricted
to matters actually connected
with or pertaining to the newspa
per business, and that if any oth
er business is to be considered it
shall be deferred until the busi-
,. ness meetings of the Associations
have been held and adjourned.
"Resolved, further.That we ap
peal to the President of the Unit
ed States, to the Postmaster Gen
eral and to our Representatives
in Congress to use their influence
vf or the adoption and enforcement
.' of such laws or regulations as
will restrict the second-class
mailing privileges to such news
papers and periodicals as are
wholly printed in the towns and
cities from which they are pub
lished." Raise Political Prices
The Association also adopted
thc following resolutions regard
ing announcement fees:
"Whereas, sinco the prevailing
prices for political announce
ments were established many
years ago, the cost of all manner
of printing materials and equip
ment connected with the business,
including labor, has more than
doubled, and,
"AVhereas, the business requir
es a much greater investment in
labor and equipment to produce
the newspaper demanded by the
public today than in days gone
by, and,
"Whereas, the prevailing price
for political announcements is
less than the price charged for
any other class of advertising,
and,
"Whereas, the emoluments of
public office have in most instanc
es more than doubled during the
past decade; therefore, be it
"Resolved by the DeSoto Coun
ty Press Association, That we
recommend and will charge for
all political announcements $10
each, such fee to allow a maxi
mum of 150 words and a pro
rata charge for all overlSO words,
ueh fee to be paid in advance in
each and every instance.
"Resolved further, That we
recommend this fee to our fellow
publishers and to other associa
tions throughout the State.
The following officers were e
lected for the ensuing year: A. P.
Jordan, Punta Gorda Herald,
president; E. R. Jones, DeSoto
County News, vice-president ;
Andrew Carter, Arcadia Enter
prise, secretary and treasurer.
County Press Association Met
The DeSoto County Press Asso
ciation met in Punta Gorda yes
terday with a good attendance.
Much business of a routine
character was transacted,and res
olutions v and recommendations
were passed to be presented to
the South Florida Press Associa
tion at its meeting in Bartow the
14th inst.
The editors were delightfully
entertained at noonday luncheon
at the Travelers' Hotel by the
Hon. Adrian Jordan, editor of the
Punta Gorda Herald. Editor Jor
dan never does anything by halv
es, whether it be editing a paper
or acting as host, and to say that
all the boys enjoyed themselves to
the fullest extent, is putting the
matter sufficiently modestly.
In the afternoon ex-Governor
Gilchrist took the editors to his
interesting museum of curios.
There is probably no such private
collection of interesting articles
to be found in the south, and ev
eryone who has the' opportunity
of seeing this interesting collec
tion should do so.
The association re-elected the
old officers, A. P. Jordan presi
dent, and Andrew Carter, secre
tary. The next meeting will be
held at Arcadia. Arcadia News,

State
Health Exhibit
Start
Cars to
Jacksonville The three health
exhibit cars of the State Board of
Health will be thrown open for
inspection next week, before be
ginning a tour of the State in the
interest of education on. matters
pertaining to health and preven
tion of disease. For many weeks
the work of equipping the. cars
with various contrivances, appa-
ratus, models, displaysand pic
tures has been going on, and is
now practically complete, accord
ing to a health officer.
' No definite itinerary has been
decided upon, but it is probable
that the "cars will be taken
straight down fhe East Coast to
Key West for the. first exhibition
and lecture, and work northward
from one town to another.
The cars are now parked below
the Atlantic Coast Line freight
offices on West Forsyth street.
When they, are commissioned for
actual service, Florida will be
numbered among the few states
having such traveling exhibits
for the education of the people.
Six And One-Half Inch Roses
A vase of the most beautiful
roses ever seen by mortal eye was
placed on the editor's desk this
morning. These roses grew in the
garden of one of Arcadia's splen
did homes, and speak, as no word
can, in behalf of the wonderful
climate- of our little city. One of
these roses was by actual meas
urement six and one-half inches in
diameter, or approximately twen
ty inches in circumference.
While admiring this beauty we
could but contrast a climate
where such beautiful roses can be
grown in midwinter with a cli
mate of snow and icicles. Come
to Florida just now. Arcadia

"Suectss has turned many a
man's head" observes the Boston
Transcript. Truo enough. But
it hasn't anything on the short
skirt in that respect.
GILCHRIST ON
Ex-Governor Albert W. Gil-
christ," candidate for United
States senator, being interviewed
regarding his position, in relation
to voting for the proposed consti
tutional amendment to the Feder
al Constitution, providing for
national prohibition, replied as
follows:
"I understand that an Absolute
Democracy is one in which elec
tors vote direct on measures. ' I
understand ours is a Representa
tive Democracy, in which electors
elecVj representatives, in this in
staiiceyi senator, to carry out the
expressed wishes of the people.
"During the senatorial term
commencing March 4, 1917, the
people of Florida will undoubted
ly express themselves for or a
gainst statewide prohibition. In
my opinion, one of the best ways
of enforcing statewide prohibi
tion, is through national prohibi
tion. Should the people of the
state declare for prohibition, and
in case I should be elected sena
tor, I will support and vote for
such proposed constitutional a-
mendment to the Federal Consti
tution.-
"Suppose one should be elect
ed to the United States senate on
a nation-wide prohibition nlat-
I STREET
By their ways ye shall know
them :
Big cities leave indelible marks
on the public habits of their resi
dents and each city has its dis
tinctive identification stamps. It
takes no Sherlock Holmes to rec
ognize the typical Southerner or
Northerner or Westerner away
from home. Close observation and
some acquaintance with local
characteristics qualify one to
name the home of the traveler,
within a cloce degree of accuracy
The Chicagoan is usually in an
unapologizing hurry, he rushes
"Cross Lots" and over obstacles,
including other humans in , his
haste. The New Yorker also is
in a hurry, but he realizes that
others are also in a hurry and he
makes haste without unnecessary
collision. The Jacksonville man
or woman, and those of Atlanta,
New Orleans and other Southern
cities are more deliberate in their
movements, but they" got there."
They block the sidewalks for long
conversations about the weather
and other social topics and they
make other pedestrians go around
But there are many characteris
tics common to Americans that
distinguish them from Europeans
and other Continental citizens,
which mark them the world over.
In fact, Americans have some be
setting sins which ought to be
forgotten.
The time was, not many years
ago, when the trailing skirts of
women swept the streets stirring
up the dust and raised prolonged
and continuous howl from .the
public press. But it's different
now, very different.
A generation ago gentlemen
chewed tobacco and they were
restless in the drawingroom or in
church, but the time has passed
when the cuspidor was indjspensi
ble in the home.
But a number of street man
ners remain unchecked, which in
the light of modern sanitary
. 1 .it
science, are dangerous to puoiic
health. A blanket indictment
would include, among others, the
PROHIBITION
form, many voting for him on ac-
count of personality, friendship,
locality, or because of other is
sues for which he stood: If na
tional prohibition is adopted,
Florida necessarily becomes a
prohibition state. After his c
lection, suppose, upon a vote of
the people of the state, Florida
declares against prohibition. .In
voting for national prohibition,
which would make Florida a pro
hibition state, the senator would
be voting against the expressed
wshes of the people of the state.
If,v upon a vote of the people of
the state, Florida declared for
prohibition, the senator would be
voting against the expressed
wishes of the people of his state,
if he did not vote for national
prohibition, one of the most effec
tive means of enforcing state pro
hibition. "I invite your attention to the
following plank in my platform:
'As senator, he will be the repre
sentative of the people of all
Florida. If, during his , incum
bency, the people declare for pro
hibition, woman suffrage,! he will
support their views.' Although

.offences of expectoration on side-
walks and in public places; the
scattering of fruit skins, bits of
paper and other refuse in the
streets, to be carried about by ev
ery breeze that blow3; the care
less and improper cleaning of
streets, which takes up the larger
part of street refuse but leaves
the smallest particles to be blown
into the faces of passers-by; the
habit still permitted in many cities-,
of sweeping the sidewalks in
business and residence districts
at any hour of the day, instead of
requiring such work to be done in
the early morning hours before
general traffic has begun.
There would be other counts in
this indictment, but probably the
most serious of tho.je named is the
sin of expectoration. Closely al
lied is the other habit of sneezing
and coughing in public places
without any attempt to smother
the violence of the explosion with
the handkerchief.
Colds, bronchitis, la grippe, in
fluenza. tuberculosis and other af
fections of the membrane of the
throat and lungs' are the result of
germ infection. While these
germs are not conveyed except by
contact, the word includes the
carrying of such germs by exhala
tion through sneezing and cough

who is hear enough to be caught
in the spray from the mouth or
nose of jihe afflicted individual
say within two or three feet.
lence, (the danger from the un-
smotneri;a or uncovered sneeze or
cough, 01V even from emphatic
talking incrowed public places.
An emphatic protest would be
heard if a smallpox patient were
allowed to ride in a street car or
to attend church or the theatre,
yet the gul)ible, careless Ameri
can public raisesonly a feeble
howl if any at all when the tu
bercular patient h&s the unpro
tested freedom of those same pub
lic places. And they menace of
smallpox does not compare with
that of tuberculosis.
If the smallpox patient is de
nied the legal and moral right to
mingle freely with his fellow
men in public places, why should
these privileges be extended, or
not denied, to the sufferer from a
cold, influenza, la grippe, . con
sumption and the rest? If the
conscience of the individual does
not impel him to protect the pub
lic from himself, is it not the duty
of the public conscience to pro
tect the public?
Americans, emphatically in
cluding Floridians, are careless,
almost criminally careless, of the
health rights they possess. The
ways of disease, like those of
Providence, are mysterious, at
least to the mind of the layman,
but knowing what we do, we won
der if our street manners must bel
regulated by law, or have we real
ly conscience enough to protect
others from ourselves? State

Take Precautions Against Bloom
Drop
rsioom drop is anotner one 01
the troubles which arise to p.?r
plex the citrus grower. This dis
ease is thought to be caused by a
physiological condition of the
plant, "and not by an organism, ac
corduig to B. F. Floyd, plant phy
siologist to the University of
Florida Experiment Station. It
must not be confused with the
dropping caused by the thrips.
Although the cause of the dis
ease is not known, it is believed
that trees in healthy well-fed con
dition will not be bothered. Af
ter the trees have borne a crop
they need some readily available
plant food to set them right again.
It is probable that an application
of ammonia in either a complete
or an incomplete fertilizer will
prevent this form of bloom drop
Phosphoric acid also should be
applied.
What Will We do for Fertilizers?
What will we do for fertilizers
is the cry from every section. The
best we can is the only answer.
There is no substitute for potash,
and the only outlook seems to per
suade the crops to get along on
less than they have before. Early
plowing is advisable at any time.
It is of vital importance this year.
E. S. Pace, district agent'for the
University of Florida Extension
Division, advises the farmers to
break their land immediately and
turn under all the vegetable mat
ter on it. The trash on the land
will then have time to decay and
become incorporated with the
soil. This material will not only
furnish plant food but it will as
sist in liberating native plant
food in the soil.
A stalk cutter or disc harrow
should be run over the field be
fore it is plowed. This will cut
up the vegetable matter so that it
can be turned completely under.
Otherwise it will not rot so quick
ly. The foregoing method will
not furnish all the potash or fer
tilizer needed, but it will make
growing conditions happier for
the crop and fair results can be
had.

London The most complete ac
count yet published of the new -Russian,
campaign north of the
Roumanian border reached Lon
don Monday night from the Pet
rograd correspondent of the As
sociated Press. This indicates tho
evacuation of Czernowitz by, tho
Austrians as among tho probabili
ties as the result of the Russian
successes.
By holding the Teutonic forces
on the line of Valdimir-Volynskyi
on the Galician frontier, while;
fortifying and pressing forward
at some points, the Russians have
checked the German attempt to
advance from the direction of
Kolki. and improve their position
along the Kovel railway east
wards tawards Sarny. North of
Czartorysk the Russians drove
the Germans back and occupied
the town of Khriasi.
The very fact that the Russians
are advancing along the Kovel-
Rovno railway is held by military
men to be of great importance,
sinco it indicates a concentration
with a view of taking Kovel, an;
important point of communica
tion between the German and
Austrian front. In order to re
lieve the pressure on Kovel-Sar- .
ny line, the Teutons counter-attacked
southwest of Kolki but
without result.
The situation at Saloniki has
been complicated through the ar
rest by the entente officers of tho
consuls, not only of the central
powers, but also of one neutral
country Norway. Swift repris
als by Bulgaria and possibly by
others of the central allies al
ready is indicated. The arrests
appear to have been part of a
campaign begun some time ago,
aiming to purge Saloniki of spies
or suspected spies. The number
of persons arrested in the course
of this campaign already Tuns in
to three figures. -
French aeroplanes have bom
barded the Austrian camps at
Gievgeli, Serbia, as a return for
the recent visit of aviators of the
central allies to Saloniki. It in
said that the southern Balkan
theater offers both sides excel
lent opoprtunities for aerial at
tacks, but the Greek public is
much alarmed at this threatened
extension of hostilities to their
neighborhood and it is possible
that the Greek government will
endeavor to effect some arrange
ment to curb aerial activities.
The Balkan correspondent of
the Times sends a dispatch in
which he declares that the Bul
garian officials are in complete
subjection to German jurisdic
tion. He says that every depart
ment of tho Bulgarian adminis
tration is under control of Ger
man officers whose permission is
necessary for the transaction of
the simplest business.
