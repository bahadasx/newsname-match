London, Jan. (.Labor leaders

scription. The executive commutes

sented to that body, ln the name of
3,000,000 tradea unionists, a resolu
tion In protest against the govern
ment's compulsory service plans.
Cries of approval greeted the com
mittee document, which expressed
regret that the "nation's solidarity
had been gravely Imperilled and In
dustrial and political liberty men
aced by . the plans of ths conscrip-
tlonlsts."
Four hundred labor organisations,
Including the most powerful among
Bngland'a labor bodies, were repre
seuted.. '
One group even demanded that
Arthur Henderson, labor member of
the cabinet, resign. ',
Harry Gosling, president, and a
number of labor members of parlia
ment were present.
Preceding Introduction of the re
solution, .the executive commltteo re
ported labor's ."deep-rooted, tradi

WKch She Hakes Escape
Marseilles,, France, Jan. The
French liner Karnak, with 250 pas
sengers, arrived here today, after an
exciting flight before a submarine all
night. She brought survivors of the
British Uners Mlddleton and Abella,
aunk by submarines.
Many of the Karnak passengers
were hysterical as they realized the
possibility that the submarine would
overtake them and blaat their ship
"We sighted her at dusk," said an
officer. . "The caDtain put on full
steam ahead through a heavy storm,
and our bow was Just splitting the
big waves.".;;. ;';, ;'.
Passengers from the Abella and
Mlddleton, Just rescued, were so ter
rorised at their fresh peril that their
condition was pitiful. Some ; pas
sengers stood at the stern, watching
the chase, but most of them were too
frightened to do other thanjto eower
incomers. ;,. g. ;..,: ,
The submarine, an extremely large
one, was bothered ' y ' the ' heavy
waves, and to this was due the fact
that the Karnak managed to out
distance her; ;
The Karnak passengers were ready
for emergencies. Life belts were
donned and the boats were swung
outward. Meantime, everybody re
mained fully dressed and sat on deck
or In the amoking room while the
liner slg-sagged her way through tho
storm to dodge a possible torpedo.
The Abella had previously been
reported aa torpedoed, tout the above

though the government hopes that
strong leaders will oppose it and win
many over to their way of thinking.
The News today viewed the con
scription situation with pessimism,
predicting not only that Labor Mem
ber Henderson will quit the cabinet
but likewise that the Issue will force
a grave domestic Crisis, leading to
a general election within a few weeks
and resulting ln the formation of a
conservative ministry of which Lloyd
George will 1)6 a member. This paper
declared that the present cabinet'
lacks vitality. ' . '
The Matl declared the 'government
"Is facing the greatest crisis or the
war." The Chronicle, - Express and
Post attacked the bill, but the Times
and Tolegraph supported It. v
The general view here Is that de
spite the opposition of laborites and
Irish mem'bera, parliament will pass
the bill. .'.;' ; ; :i '

London, Jan. 6. -England's failure

whereupon I was recalled. I was in
formed on arriving in London that
the government wanted 1 fresh, un
biased opinion from another com
mander concerning the possibilities
of early evacuation." ,

Copenhagen, Jan. 6. Sweden does
not Intend to let Germany lose the
war struggle, even If Sweden Is
forced to join the central powers to
prevent such a conclusion. :
Sweden may not Insist on aa out-
and-out German victory, , but she
feels that, for her own safety, she
can not allow the Russians to beat
Germany. Sweden is not particu
larly pro-German, and yet she is not
pro-ally, but she Is antl-Rosslaa with ,
her whole souL She will fight with
Germany before she will see Russia
win, and she believe her strength
would be the deciding factor in the
last resort '-
This outline constitutes the out
standing facts in the Scandinavian
situation as presented today to the
United Press by reliable sources.
As far back as the Swedes can re- .
member they have been In terror of
a Russian attempt Jp .secure a. covet-,
ed wam-wetherprf on the west .
coast of the Scandinavian peninsula.
This could be attained only at Nor- '
way's expense and Norway, could
only "be "reached through Sweden. ,
The Swedes claim that they could
put Into the field 1,000,000 of train- ,
ed troop.v".:vs ;-.vP 1 ' J
While military experts doubt these
figures, they concede that the Swedes
are admirably trained, well armed
and ; tenaciously courageous. In
event of, hostilities, they would In
vade Finland, expecting the Finns to
join them ln a campaign to capture
the Russian capital, Petrograd, and
then they would sweep southward, to
join the Germans near Riga.
The Norwegians sympathize with
England from sentiment, and ln con
sequence of trade relations. More- .
over, they are mindful of the ruin
that England's navy would work on
the Norwegian merchant fleet the
largest except England s and ter-
many's. While Norwegian army men
are mostly pro-German by reason of
their German training,- the masses
are friendly toward England. But. ;
for political reasons, the Norwegians
presumably . would be with the
Swedes ln case ot war against Russia,
if they were compelled to take sides.
The Norwegians can muster 400,000
soldiers, all well equipped. .
On the other hand. Denmark does
not enter Into ' Scandinavian calcula
tions ln the matter of a prospective
struggle against Russia. Denmark
is frankly and persistently pro-ally.
The Danes hate Germany, remember
ing how they wrested the tiny terri
tory ot Schle8wlg-Holsteln from Den
mark years since; further they fear
the rest of their possessions will go
the same way, and hence there Is no .
chance of their joining ln an alli
ance that would redound to Ger
many! advantage.
