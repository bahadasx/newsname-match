International Tribunal Can Be Eatab

Ware in Future and Negotiations
for Peace Should Be Opened at
Once—Mr. Gary Says That Each of
the Warring Nationa Is Starving for
Men and Money—End of the War
Will Create New Conditions for This
Country to Face.
NEW YORK, Jan. 5.—Elbert H.
Gary, chairman of the United States
Steel corporation, today Issued a state
ment dealing in detail with the pre
vailing prosperous conditions in the
steel and iron trade, together with
a forecast for the future of that in
4»stry.
Reference is made to the European
oonfllct in its world-wide application
to economic conditions. Judge Gary
calls attention to the dangers of over
production or Inflation by manufac
turers and bankers, resulting from
over-confidence, and the aid of the
government is invoked for adequate
protection of the country's industries.
In part, the statement follows:
"It will be admitted by all manu
facturers of these products that there
Is no reason for complaint at the pres
ent time, as to the volume or urgency
of the demand, nor in most cases as
to prices received, notwithstanding
the cost of production has been larger
during the last five years because of
Increases in wages, freight charges,
etc.
"The rate of production at present
in the United States is about 38,000,
000 tons of pig iron and about 41,000,
000 tons of steel ingots per annum.
This is compared with a rate of 19,
000,000 tons of pig iron and 16,000,
000 tons of steel ingots one year ago,
Und 36,600,000 tons of pig iron and
3<>,000,000 ton of steel ingots at high
water mark in the year 1913 for pig
iron and 1912 for ingots.
"Prices could easily be materially
advanced and perhaps will be, al
though I believe as to some of the
Commodities, at least, they are high
enough. It is not certain they can
be controlled, for the reason that the
requirements of purchasers and the
offers they make fix the prices to a
large extent.
"Apparently about 75 per cent, of
the sales is for domestic consumption
anfl the balance for foreign use, di
rectly or indirectly. The influence of
the export sales upon domestic sales
1 do not undertake to say.
"Conditions pertaining to this indus
try reflect, more or less, those of
other lines and perhaps are an indi
cation of the general situation. Cer
tainly, there are evidences which can
not reasonably be questioned of great
prosperity. It is not my purpose to
discuss the reasons for these satisfac
tory conditions. They exist; and it
now seems probable that they may

READY FOR THE
CONTRACTORS
PLAN8 COMPLETED FOR STORE
AND WAREHOUSE OF LEWIS
TOWN MERCANTILE CO.
TO OPEN BIDS ON JANUARY I7
The plans and specifications for the
new store and warehouse building of
the Lewistown Mercantile company,
have been completed by Wasmans
dorf & Eastman, and are ready to be
placed in the hands of contractors,
who wish to submit figures on the
erection of the structure. Plans can
be seen at the architects' office.
The Lewistown Mercantile company
was formed a short while ago, the
principal stockholders being W. K.
Nash and E. P. Nash, both of Minne
apolis. The capital stock is $150,000.
The company will engage in the
wholesale business. The location of
the new building across from the Mil
waukee depot grounds and the Judith
Basin flour mills. The building will
be two stories and full basement in
height, and will be 65 by 100 feet in
ground space dimension. It will be
built of Lewistown brick.
The excavation for the building has
already been completed, and work on
the building proper will start as soon
as the contract is awarded and the
weather will permit of good working
conditions..
MANY LARGE WHEAT CROPS
IN THE RENCNLAND REGION
A farmer from the Benchland coun
try has just handed the Democrat
News the following clipping from an
Iowa newspaper:
M. A. Harney, formerly a resident
of Wagner, but for the past four
years located near Lewistown, Mon
tana, was a Lake Andes visitor Wed
nesday and while in town made this
office a pleasant call. Mike says he
wants to die in Montana and that's
putting it pretty strong as to one's
likes of a country. A great deal of
that country is devoted to wheat rais
ing, in which business he has been
engaged on an extensive scale. This
year he harvested 22,000 bushels, and
to show the large scale others work
on, says out there he is called a "dub"
wheat raiser. Mr. Harney was one
of the hearly settlers In this county
and his many friends in all parts will
be pleased to hear of his success.
This progressive Benchland farmer
desires to state that a crop of the
size of Mr. Harney's is not a rare
thing in that country. He says that
at least a half dozen men in that sec
tion had crops of about the same size,
which speaks well for Benchland as
a farming center.
MILWAUKEE CHANGE.
Effective today, J. W. Ross, formerly
chief dispatcher on the Rocky Moun
tain division of the Milwaukee, with
headouarters at Three Forks, has been
appointed as trainmaster of the Mus
jselshell division, with headquarters at
Miles City. This will probably occa
sion some change in the Lewistown
offices, but just what wag not known
yesterday.
ENJOYING THE TRIP.
Senator and Mrs. J. E. Lane, writing
from Honolulu, report a pleasant trip
to that city. The ocean voyage was
made without untoward incident, no
hostile submarines being encountered.
After a short stay in the "Paradise
of the Pacific" the Lewistown people
planned to sail for Japan and China.
CHARGED WITH BURGLARY.
Robert Mock and James Carson
were brought in from Grass Range
Monday and placed in the county

DAVID HILGER, HOME FROM HEL
ENA, SAYS UNSUBSCRIBED $600
TAKEN BY ONE FIRM.
MAKE REPAIRS DURING JANUARY
The Montana building at San Diego
will be maintained during the year
1916, when the greater San Diego fair,
to be known as the Panama-California
international exposition, will be run
ning full force, succeeding the Pan
ama-California exposition of 1915.
David Hilger, chairman of the Mon
tana commission, returned Friday
from Helena and announces the suc
cess of the campaign to raite $4,600
to keep the Montana building open
next year at this fair. W. A. Clark
subscribed $3,000 and other patriotic
individuals soon brought it up to with
in $600 of the required amount. Mr.
Hilger informed the Democrat
Friday that this amount had been
pledged by one enterprising Montana
firm or individual. That Is, the prom

would not be otherwise arranged,
would be made good by this party or
parties.
To Make. Repairs.
During the month of January the
Montana building will be closed down
and repairs will be made, as well as
some improvements. The amount
raised is sufficient to do this and to
run the building for the entire year
More exhibits will be added and the
place will be made very attractive.
Other buildings will also undergo
repairs during that month, and the new
building for the Canadian exhibit will
be erected. This will be one of the

HE
CT
TO LENGTHEN PASSING TRACKS
ON MIWAUKEE RESULT OF
ELECTRIFICATION.
IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT {200,000
The bid of Contractor 11. J. Burke
of Lewistown for the lengthening of
passing tracks on the Rocky Moun
tain division of the Milwaukee, has
been accepted, with orders to start
immediately and rush the work to com
pletion. Contractor Burke began load
ing his outfits yesterday ready to ship
over to the main line and will carry
out the work according to instructions.
Electrification or the Milwaukee's
roadway has caused such increase in
traffic us to render the present 2,500
and 3,000 fe- pus "ng tracks inad
quate. In order to dispatch the big
trains over the electrified divisions
without any undue hitch, some of the
passing tracks will be lengthened to
almost a mile.
This work will take about a year
to complete, and represent in rough
estimate, about $200,000 expenditure.
DEMAND FOR CARS.
Government reports show that there
will be a great demand for freight cars
for carrying grain during the season
in all grain-shipping communities. A
large percentage of the grain of Fer
gus county is still being held here,
as is the case in many other localities,
and when grain movements begin in
earnest all over the country, the rail
roads are going to lie taxed for equip
ment. In an appeal for co-operation
to prevent car shortage as much as
possible those facts are set forth:
"The government crop reports indi
cate approximately 913,000,000 bushels
more grain in 1915 than in 1914, and
10,000,000 tons more of hay, which
fact, taken in connection with the in
creased tonnage from steel and muni
tion plants, together with the well
known inadequacy of ocean transpor
tation, emphasizes the most urgent
need of co-operation on the part of
all if a serious car shortage and its
accompanying effect on all the lines
of trade is to he avoided.
'On account of excessive rain and
;>ther adverse conditions which delayed
the threshing of wheat and oats the
movement of grain for the first crop
months of 1915 (July, August, Septem-.
her, October) is 25 per cent, less than
the movement during the some months
of 1914 at the terminals of Chicago,
St. Louis, Omaha, Peoria and Milwau
kee, and as the government reports
indicate an increase in the amount of
wiieat and oats raised in 1915 of over,
450,000.000 bushelH in excess of 1914,
it is evident that there is an enormous
amount of wheat and oats left in the
country awaiting transportation.
"It is estimated an the best author
ity that there are 96,000,000 bushels
of the old 1914 corn crop on the farms,
an increase of 16,000,000 bushels com
pared with the same month a year ago,
and the time is at hand for the move
.1 „ . , . , .
ment of the 191a corn crop, winch is
next to the largest in the history of
the country. The increase of 913,081,
000 bushels of grain, if loaded in cars
at 1,350 bushels to the car, would
make 676,356 more carloads than
1914."
