KEXTTfKUft
EMIMML COMMENT.
Gen. Granvlle M. Dodge, distin
gulshetf soldier nnd railroad builder ',
died at Council Bluffs, la., Jan. 3.
, It is expected that Justice Lamar 'b
lace on- the Supreme Court Bench
llvfill be filled by the appointment of
Jfmother southern man.
Secretary Simon of the British cab
inet has quit. He evidently failed
to get the proper attention when he
.told the others to wigwag.
J. P. Shipley, of Mound City, Mo.,
four years ago took some oil stock in
n real estate deal and believed bin
self cheated. Recently he was of
fered $600,000 for his holdings.
Si men who acted as election
officers in the recent Democratic sen
atorial primary in Memphis were
indicted by the grand jury on charges
of fraud.
A $30,000 verdict for breach of
promise, which Mrs. Ida M. McNabb,
of Milwaukee, won in the District
Supreme Court at Washington sev
eral months ago against John S. Kin
ney, a 'millionaire mine owner has
been reversed by the Court of Ap
peals.
The ladies of the Magazine club
arte entitled to much praise for bring
ing an art exhibition of great merit
toLthe Carnegie library nextSatur
Jpiy. No admission fee will becharg
etf.and it is an opportunity that
should be grasped by all art lovers.
The recurrence of night rider out
rages in Caldwell county need not be
lakentoo seriously. It is reported
Khat some notices have beep posted
warning tobacco "growers who sell
their tobacco on loose floor markets
that they will be whipped. Some of
these notices, it is said, have been
posted in 'the western edge of Chris
tinn countv. It is not at all likely
that there is any organization be
hind such threats. There are no
markets anywhere doing much busi
ness except by loose sales. Public
sentiment is strongly set against
further lawlessness, as shown by
prompt actien in several counties.
The new iiidge in Caldwell county
TOnq n soldier during the old trouble
nnd it 5a helieved he can be relied
upon to dp his duty.
THE 'NEXT LEGISLATURE.
HereWe Editor H. A. Sommers'
ideas on what the next Kentucky
. general assembly should do:
It should get down to work with
the beginning-of the session and not
frijter away thirty days as is ,usual
before it actually begins business.
It should pass a sensible revenue
and taxation law which will raise
enough revenue for the State with
out increasing the rate of taxation.
It should pass such a corrupt prac
tice act as will prevent the use of
money by candidates in election.
It Bhould amend the school laws if
possible to that we can have rural
consolidated schools.
Itshould cut outevefy wastetul
and extravagant use of money in all
departments of the State govern
jrcent. j It should passra law to work the
Wort term convicts on the public
rojjjs in accordance with the Consti
tutional amendment recently adopted.-
-
It should BOt aside by act 5 definite
amountfrom the road fuRd for the
propermaintenance of roads built
under-State aid.
It should pas3 a law which will
render it , impossibly for a saloon
keeper anywhere jn the State to keep
open on Sunday without forfeiture
ofJk!
license.
should make it a felony for the
second conviction for bootlegging.
It 8-hould pass a broad tire law for

CABINET CRISIS
FAR FROM END
'
Differences Between Ministers
0ver Conscription Plan
May Bring Rupture.
TWO OTHERS MAY RESIGN
McKenna and Runciman Are
Thought Likely to Give
. Up Their Portfolios. .
London, Jan. 5. Itagnin becomes
evident that the Cabinet crisis is far
from.ended. The only definite point
is that Sir John Simon, Secretary of
State for Home Affairs, has resigned.
He Had a prolonged interview with
Premier Asquith yesterday. The
Premier did his utmost to inuduce
Sir John to remain in the Cabinet
but without avail, and it is almost
certain that the Home Secretary's
resignation will be officially an
nounced on the re-assembling of
Parliament.
The position of Reginald McKenna.
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and
Walter Runciman, president of the
Board of Trade, still is undecided.
They- are making the acceptance of
the Government compulsion bill con
ditional upon securing a concession
to their views on the eventual size
of the army.
In this matter Premier Asquith is
in an embarrassing position. He is
being strongly impelled from the
outside not to yield this point and it
is believed that a majority in the
Cabinet itself is against their views
Hence today's meeting of the Cabi
net to consider the latest draft of
the compulsion bill may result in
further changes.

IN CONTROL
ORGANIZATION
Governor's Message NotalMor
Earnestness And!
Brevity.
WOULD RESIST TAX DAWS'.
Protest Against LegislatureEm?-
ployirig More Help :fam .
Provided by Constitution;
Frankfort, Ky., Jan. 4v The Ken
tucky general assembly for 191C was
convened here at noon, today. -
Gov. A. O. Stanley in- a mossage
notable for earnestness and brevity
impressed upon members, of. both
branches the urgent necessity for
strictest economy in all state depart
ments, for correction-of various gov
ernmental abuses, and for. construc
tive legislation along the lines laid
down in the democratic platform.
Both houses organized bytba elec
tion as their officers the nominees.oL
the democratic caucuses
Governor Stanley's- message con
taining about 2,500 words, was read
to the members of the legislature by
the clerks of the respective- bouses.
The message was the brinfestwhich-
has been submitted by a chief: execu-
tive in many years.
The message opened withV- an
injunction to the members""ttrresist:
the importunities of many, sincere '
people who will want the- state In
appropriate money whicb ifchasn.'t
BOt.:
Mr. .Stanley made -an- emphatic
protest against the legislature em
ploying more help than.is.ipr.oyided
for in the constitution.
"It does not make any d.ifference
whether the help is needed or not,'
the message declared. Its employ
ment is a direct violation of the
constitution which the members are
pledged to support.
"Those only are worthy to write
the law who resptct the law,'rGov.
Stanley declared.
The message took upin detaif the
platform pledges of the democrtic
party. The governor in this connec
tion called attention to the fact that
the other leading parties as well as
the democrats have demanded, most
of these planks, and there is no need
for partisanship in carrying them
out.
Legislation recommended by Gov.
Stanley included revision of the tax
laws, in accordance with the new
constitutional amendment, a change
in the contract labor system to per
mit working convicts outside of the
penitentiarycorrupt practice legis
lation, an anti-trust law, an anti pass
bill, an anti-lobbyirg act, to increase .
the powers ef the railroad commis- ,
sion, a-workmen's compensation act.
The activity of suffragists here-,
indicate that the suffrage amend-
I merit will be a live question at this
session. The Kentucky Equal Rights
Association has its headquarters in
the McClure building, but has been
distributing its printed propaganda
among the legislators. Mrs. Thomas
Jefferson Smith, president, and Mrsv
uesiui .uteciwuriuKi, lurnicr presi
dent, are directing the woikers.
Senator Combs, of Lexington, will
introduce the suffrage bill In thr
senate.
