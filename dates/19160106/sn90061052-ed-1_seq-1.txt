Eighteenth Year No IS
SHALL WE HAVE A COM
MERCIAL CLUB
Has Jasper a Commercial Club
Weve been asked thatquestlonudozen
times in the hist four years by people
from other places and weve had to
answer It in the negative and have
been ashamed of It every time It
dont seem right that n tow n as good
as Jasper is with as many progressive
and intelligent business incn nnd citi
zens in it as this town has should
have no organization of this kind
It goes without saying that a dozen
men organized for the purpose can ac
complish far more for tbe community
than three times ns mrlny who are not
organized Xonecanqtrestion
the great majority of
the citizenship here No one an say
that the business men of Jasper do1 not
give freely of their time and mondy for
the public benefit when occasion re
quires and vet there it no organization
here whose business it is to make the
town a better plnceto do business in
to live In or to live near
It is needless here to call attention to
the fact that most any good town one
can name has such an organization
And itis needless to hope that every
body would join such a movement or
even that there will not be a few who
would use their energies toward block
ing the purpose of such an organization
In spite of the knockers and dead
wood 12 or 15 live fellows here with
the intelligence and pep that exists
can bring many things to pass in n
place like this if they wllhvork together
for the PUBLIC GOOD
Wc would not by any means limit
the membership and working force to
the townspeople There is plenty of
mighty good material in the country
round about Jasper who would be a
benefit to such a club Men who ap
preciate Ihe fact that a good live town
means something to them and adds a
cash value to evervacre adjacent there-
1672Tlrtstntmrtftu rJtirrAtyriSlJ
and the south end of Barton are spec
ially favored by the residence tjiereln
of many such farmers
It is also unnecessary to suggest the
business to be taken up by such a club
Every intelligent man knows there is
plenty to do
What do you sny gentlemen Shall
we do it and do it NOW
Former Citizens Return
8 AXoIaud former resident of
Jasper dropped in Friday evening ami
