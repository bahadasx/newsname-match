Western Newpp Union New Setilco.
Washington, D. C There was no
lessoning of the tension In tho now
submarine crisis with President Wil
son's return to the Whlto House to
take personal chargo of the situation,
, kvbut there were marked indications of
i i the president's intention to procoed
carefully and deliberately beforo com
mitting the United States to the next
step in its already strained relations
with the Teutonic powers.
At tho state department tho hope
was expressed that there would be
opportunity to settle tho crisis amica
bly, and it was stated that tho Amer
lean government believed that Aus
tria's assurances in the Ancona note
wero given In good faith.
Two points, it was emphasized, must
be cleared up before the next move
is made. It must bo established
whether the British liner Persia ac
tually was torpedoed, and, if so, what
was the nationality of the submarine.
President Wilson's first act on his
return was to lss,10 a statement
through Secretary Tumulty promising
the country action Just as soon as the
full facts in tho Persia disaster can
Lo learned.
"The president and the secretary
of state are taking every moans pos
. eible to obtain the full facts in this
Eravo matter, and will act Just as
soon as the information is obtained,"
said the official statement issued at
tho Whlto Houso offices.

Paris Paper Insists that Kaiser Is No
Longer Able to Speak.

standing denials, that the Gorman em
peror is suffering from cancer of the

feJn' 'February, 1911," according to
WSeMatln, "doctors wero considering
"whether it was necessary to remove
IbV entire larynx in order to stay tho
prpgress of the disease. They raised
the question as to whether the em
peror would be able to speak it such
an operation were performed. The
leading specialists of every capital In
Europe were consulted. It was learn
ed that an eminent surgeon in Paris
fead,fwith the artificial larynx and a
breathing tube opening into the tra
cheal restored the power of speech to
cancerous patients who had undergone
totai ablation of tho affected organs.
"Meanwhile, as a result of a minor
Operation with a bistoury ,and a few
"weeks' absolute rest, tho emperor's
condition improved, as is often tho
case? in this disease, tho progress of
which is implacable, but slow. It is
another operation of this kind which
hasJust been performed, but it is
onlyg palliative The German em
permust either make up his mind
n to complete removal of tho larynx or
be stifled by tho growth.
' "This explains why tho emperor

PEACE TERRIS GIVEN
SUMMARY OF GERMANY'S CONDI
TIONS CIRCULATED IN BERLIN.
No Annexation of French Territory,
Freedom for Poland and Restora
tion of All German Colonies.
Borlin, Dec. 31. Tho semiofficial
Wolff bureau circulated among tho
German newspapers an exhHustlve
summary of an article from tho Neuo
Zuercher Zeltung of Zurich, Switzer
land, purporting to glvo In consider
able detail thi terms upon which, ac
cording to tho newspaper, Germany
is roady to consider peaco.
The terms named Includ th3 res
toration of Belgian sovereignty under
certain conditions, no annexation of
French territory, tho separation of
Poland from Russia as an indopoudont
kingdom under a German prlnco, tho
restoration of all Gorman colonics, tho
payment of an Indemnity- which would
assume tho form of a transfer to Ger
many of Russia's indobtodness to
Franco, amounting to somo 18,000,000,
000" francs, and tho payment for a
term of years of an annual contribu
tion by Belgium equal to the amount
hitherto spont annually on tho Belgian
military establishment.
A similar contribution would bo ex
pected from Russia or Poland, this
point not being clear In tho ar
ticle. Whether tho Belgian territory would
be restored entirely Is not specified
In tho nowspaper, but It Is stated that
tho country would bo policed that Is,
garrisoned by Germany until tho pay
ments of tho contribution wero ended,
and that measures would bo taken
to prevent Belgium from serving as
an Anglo-French outpost, either by
treaty arrangements or perhaps
through "pledges" turned' over to Ger
many, tho latter phaso apparently re
ferring to tho retention of tho Mouse
fortresses
The Wolff buroau is careful to dis
avow authoritatively that tho artlclo
Is lnterprctablo as a Gorman peaco
feeler.
