No. 26.
Marion should feel indeed proud and hopeful of the future prosperity of the city un
der the control of the city officers already in and those installed last Monday evening.
All are business men of enterprise and energy, and it would not have been possible for
the city to have selected a more representative board.

AN APPEAL TO
. THE FARMERS
In Regard to the Important Ques
tion, "Shall Ws Keep Our Co-,
unly Agent This Year?"
One of - the most important
questions that confront the farm
ers of Crittenden connty is:
Shall We Keep Our County Agent
J. R. l'.ird, Another Year? I
think we are most all agreed that
he has been a great help to us in
1915 and will be in a position to
be more helpful to us in 1916 be
cause of his acquaintance with
the people and the problems with
which they contend.
In view of the above facts, I
feel safe in claiming that a large
majority of our farmers are anx
ious to keep Mr. Bird another
year.
But right here arises another
most important question. Sou)
much do jou want him?
You know he didn't cost the
fanners at large much last year.
That about $500.00 of his salary
last year was raised in Marion.
Now don't it ?eem reasonable
that we fanners' ihouM be:ir the
most ot tint expon this, ear,
tinoe we nre first and tn ut bene
fited. About the 1st, of Dec. blanks
1 for receiving subscriptions for
this purpose were distributed to
the Secretaries o f Farmer's
Clubs and other farmers suppos
ed to bo interested. They were
requested to circulate these pa

COUNCILMAN GEORGE W. YATES.
Councilman George W. Yates
was born in this county near
Sheridan but has lived here and
sold pianos so long that Marion
claims him as her own. He be
longs to the singing and musical
family and is said (by C. R. and
W. B.) to be the oldest member
of the family now living. Well,
he is settled alright and haa
made good in his business, owns
his home and has a most inter
esting little family. . The editor,
who travelled much is glad to
see Marion's municipal affairs
looked after by business men
who pay taxes and who are in
business and have the interest of
the city, church and school at
heart We believe George W.
Yates is in that class, and we
welcome him in the City Council
them at an early date.
On the first day of January
but few of those papers have
been returned. On inquiry I
find that many of them have not
been circulated at all. Procras
tination I find to be the chief
cause of this neglect and not in
difference. Now, brother farmers lets be
gin the new year by Bwatting
that old enemy of ours, procras
tination. And let our first stroke
be to sign our subscription to the
County Agent Fund (if you have
not already done so), and the
next step to see that all of our1
neighbors have an opportunity to
do likewise.
I have faith enough in the pro
gressive spirit of Crittenden
county farmers to believe that if
this matter is rightly presented
to them and everyone given a
chance to subscribe, that there
will be no trouble raising the
$550.00 required by subscription
for County Agents salary.
If no one is circulating a paper
in your community and you are
interested get busy and circulate
one yourself.
Let's show our friends in Ma
ion and elsewhere that we ap
preciate a good opportunity when
it comes our way and that
we propose to do something for
ompi'v this ynr.
, Yours for bettor tarminir.

done it by keeping what the
people want Another instance
of his keen foresight was his

home to see his mother January
2nd and stayed over until the
3rd.
It was rather an apt coinci
dence that the tobacco market
in Crittenden county should be
opened while he was here, as it
is chiefly due to his efforts in
getting the embargo raised upon
the shipment of tobacco to the
warring nations, without which
no tobacco could be shipped
without danger of seizure, and
as a result there would have
been no market for tobacco this
year.
By his efforts the farmers are
enabled, to dispose of one of their
most important crops. Senator
James is using his best efforts to
get Marion's new postoffice built
or at least started this vear.

Smith & Hollowell, druggists,
of Princeton, Ky., on the 11th
day of October, 1915, after ex

This has been proven beyond
any question of doubt. Their

verified by prominent and reliable
parties from different, sections,
as well as one gentleman living
in Marion. He is well-known to
many residents of Crittenden
county and has been a great suf
ferer for many months. The
gentleman referred to is Mr. B.

day from the time he started
taking this preparation he re
sumed his duties as traveling

This preparation is a rheu
matic remedy, the trade name
i being "Eswell Rheumatic Rem
edy," and is only recommended
for rheumatism.
