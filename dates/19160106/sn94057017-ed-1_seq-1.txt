The Santa Fe New Mexican
yesterday printed the following:
That the negotiations between
Receiver Ely, of the New Mexico
Central, and A. Preyer, Dutch
capitalist, do not promise a sue
cessful outcome; and that Mr.
Preyer is deeply interested in
the railroad and development
situation, is shown by corre
spondence received by the Cham
ber of Commerce as follows:
Here is Mr. Ely's letter:
Chicago, Dec. 29, 1915.
Mr. George R. Van Stone, Secy.
Chamber of Commerce, Santa
Fe, New Mexico.
My Dear Mr. Van Stone:
This 3 to let you know that I
am discontinuing negotiations
with Mr. A. Preyer for the pur
chase of the New Mexico Central
railroad and for this extension,
for the reason that, whatever
his resources may be, it is his
manifest purpose to do business
entirely on strength of our prop
erty and of our stock subscrip
tions, putting in none of his own
money even in the beginning.
Upon this basis I do not believe
that he can succeed.
I am resuming negotiations
with a stronger, though possibly !
a somewhat slower acting crowd,
and assure you that I thorough
ly appreciate the spirit which
you and your associates manifest
ed. We won't quit until we get
your road for you.
With kindest personal regards,
and the best wishes of the sea
son, I am,
Yours very truly,
RALPH C. ELY,
MR, PREYERIS LETTER.
Mr. Preyer writes as follows:
Chicago, III. , Dec. 30, 1915 ,
Chamber of Commerce, Santa
Fe, New Mexico. ; ,
Gentlemen:
Referring to my recent visit to
New Mexico in connection with
proposed railroad construction, I
beg to say that since my return
to Chicago I have given my en
tire time and attention to the
preliminary organization of such
an enterprise, and as soon as
these organization matters are
concluded I am again coming tc
Santa Fe with the hope of
facilitating matters by personal
ly being on the ground.
One thing I beg to assure you
that I am more convinced than
ever that I will not take any
bonus from any community with
out giving common stock of the
railroad company in an amount
equal to that bonus. I want ev
ery citizen of New Mexico that
can possibly do so to be interest
ed in this enterprise. This will
never develop into a cneap pro
motion scheme as long as I am
connected with it. but I am de
termined to put my best business
ability and energy behind it and
make a business proposition for
New Mexico out of it. '
Another thing I am deter-
termined that I want every com
munity that takes at least $250,-
000 of common stock to name a
man on the board of directors,
I would not think of going into
this matter unless I felt that the
people of New Mexico really
wauted it, and I not only want
their support but I want their co
operation and advice, and tnis
seems to me the best way to get
it.
When I left New Mexico I had
hoped my plans would be further
advanced by this time than they
now are, but I am delayed by
my inability to secure the neces
sary data in connection with the
New Mexico Central -railroad.
As soon as the auditor's state
ments and inventory, for which
I have asked, are received I can
then determine whether it will
pay to buy that railroad from the
receiver, or whether it would be
better still to locate a line along
a more advantageous route.
I regret to learn today that
there is now talk of some other
people trying to promote a rail
road, using the same pLin3 that I
had in mind, and I taka this oc
casion to advise you that "for the
time being I have no associates,
representatives or agents, and
that any communication which
your Association in y wish to
make relative to the enterprise,
I wish you would make to me di
rect. Room 800, 108 South La
Salle street, Chicago, Illinois.
I am very anxious to secure a
map of the city of Santa Fe, and
I wonder whether you will be
good enough to kindly furnish
me with such a map and mark
thereon exactly where the New
Mexico Central and the D. & R.
G. railroad lines run through
Santa Fe and particularly the
joint ownership of their proper
ties in Santa Fe. I would like
to have this on a convenient size
map, but as I am anxious to get
it as early as possible I will be
glad to have you pend me the
thing that is most convenient for
you.
I am also very anxious to have
photographs, reports, state
ments, booklets, newspaper ar
ticles, or anything else you can
conveniently give to me, showing
the resources of Santa Fe and
the surrounding community. I
am trying to get together as
much data as -I can about New
Mexico and its resources, and
your co-operation will be very
much appreciated.
With compliments' of the sea
son and assuring you of my ap
preciation of the courtesy ex
tended to me while in Santa Fe,
I am, Yours very tmlv:
A. PREYER.
