mittee is understood to look with
favor upon the determination of the
administration to proceed with the

i.i i XI i MX., .Jan. .",. While the battle
! en t!.e horde-rs of Pessarnbin is appar
ently still far from decision, each clay
finds the Russians claiming the occu
pation of additional enemy positions,
ami Petrograd believes that if this
process continues a short time longer.
a break must come somewhere in the
lines of the ventral power.-.
The whole riii-rcy of the Hessian
nniy is being directed to making .1
ian h.-.;ween the Gorman armies in the
center and the southern Austrian forc
es., and the desperate Austrian attacks
it; the regi n of Kolki are designed to
pia-vctd this. The fighting must con
tinue for a c onsiderable time yet but i
upon the result will depend in a large
measure the strategy of both sides
when spring comes.
Although the Kussians appear to be ;
continuing their progress, there still is j
no news concerning the catual Pus- j
si in occiip.it ion of e'.ernowitz, capital t
of Pukov. ino. which already has j

The Times Petrograd correspondent, j
telegraphing Tuesday, says in the
opinion oi the military crif.es mere,
the approar-h of the Pos-ians to the
railway line running from Saleslchltky
to f'zernowitz has greatly lessened the
value of the former point for the Aus
