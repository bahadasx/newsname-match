years, according to statements
made by James Wilkinson. in an foi
address at the Y. M. C. A., last the

brought before the Commission
Council in session Tuesday after

the probation officer, Miss Leslie
Rowan, has taken charge of and
her revort as to why and how the
children were taken was almost as
interesting as the children.

for by an excellent family, where
t they will remain until it is definate
a ly settled as to a permanent man
r ner in taking care of them. Fol
