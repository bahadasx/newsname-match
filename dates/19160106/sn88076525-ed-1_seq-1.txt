Mr. Grant, so far as known, is the

gave to the Associated Press today
tfie most detailed account yet received

Blast Interrupts Dinner.
"I'was in the dining saloon of the

"The saloon became filled with

the boilers, which appeared to have
burst. There was no panic on board.
We went on deck as though we were
at drill and reported at the lifeboats

bad listed to port. I clung to the rail

slung.
Bow In Air Five Minutes.
"The last I saw of the Persia she
Itad her bow in the air, five minutes
after the explosion.
"After floating about on the wreck
age until 4 o'clock in the evening, I
saw five boats. I was pulled into one
•f them. We rowed about looking for
stragglers.
"The boat became overloaded and
the occupants were redistributed,
Four boats were tied together by
their painters and the fifth followed
.some distance away.
Cruiser Finds All Boats.
"My boat left the others in order to
search the more frequented steamship
•channels for help. We rowed for
hours. Then we saw a cruiser «id
called out: "We are English!" We
e.«p1ained that we were survivors of
1he Persia, and gave directions to tij

"Robert McNeely, American counsul

me on the voyage. He was not seen
probably because his cabin was on the

was black as iot Some passengers
were screaming, others were calling

A letter recently received by Com
missioner R. F. Flint of the state de
partment of Agriculture, from a firm
in Philadelphia, seeks information
concerning flax-spinning mills, with
the object of securing material for
manufacturing purposes. Another
letter is from a New York firm, ask
ing for a bag of flax straw for exper
imental purposes by a client in Eur
ope who claims to have invented a
process whereby flax thread can be
secured from seed-ripened straw and
paper cardboard, etc., manufactured
from the residue. The department
has also knowledge of a carload of
threshed straw being shipped to New
Jersey for experimental purposes. All
of which points indutiably to the
growing needs of eastern manufactur
ers, and to a new opportunity which
is opening to our farmers.
North Dakota plants from one-third
to one-half of the total flax acreage
of-the United -Statesy &nd more than
double the acreage of any other state.
Heretofore the flax straw has been
parctically a total loss, although it is
known to possess very valuable qual
ities which fit it for such uses as in
sulating, packing, upholstering, etc.
High freight rates have prevented its
shipment to seats of manufacture and,
there being no plants in the state,
thousands of tons are burnt annually
to make room for the succeednig crop.
This seems to be a fearful economic
waste that should be dealt with her
oically. The inquiries noted above
may be the forerunners of new con
ditions soon to prevail, and, in any
event, are encouraging, as indicating
how the interests of large corpora
tions and the North Dakota farmer
are running along parallel lines.

New York, Jan 4.—The Greek

The Thessaliniki has been disabled

THE THROAT
Paris, Jan. 4.—The Martin affirms
notwithstanding denial, that the Ger
man Emperor is suffering from can
cer of the throat and is no longer able
to speak:
"In February, 1911," according to
the Martin, "the doctors -were con
sidering whether it was necessary to
remove the entire larynx in order to
stay the progress of the disease. They
raised the question as to whether the
Emperor would be able to speak if
such an operation were performed.
The leading specialists of every capi
tal in Europe were consulted.
"Meanwhile as a result of a minor
operation with a bistoury and a few
weeks absolute rest the Emperor's
condition improved as is often the
case in this disease, the progress of
which is implicable, but slow. It is
another operation of this kind which
has just been performed. But it is
c.ily pallative. The German Emperor
must either make up his mind to com
plete removal of the larynx or be
stifled by the growth.
"This explains why the Emperor
went neither to Warsaw, Constanti
nople or Brussels.

Washington, Jan. 3.—(Special.)—
Rates on bituminous coal from the Il
linois c.nd Indiana coal fields to North
Dakota and other Northwestern states
have been increased by a proposed ad
vance of rate, effective September 30,
1915, and joined in by practically all
of the railroads west of the Misssis
sipi River. This proposed advance
was ten cents a ton and it has called
forth a complaint from the Illinois
Coal Operators' Association, the In
diana Bituminous Coal Operators' As
sociation and the Central Illinois Coal
Operators' Association to the Inter
state Commerce Commission.
This complaint alleges that bitum
inous coal from Ohio, Pennsylvania
and other states further from the
Northwestern markets gets a lower
rate because part of their route of
shipment is via the Gret Lakes, but
also alleges that rail shipments from
such more distant fields have not been
increased at the same rate as have
rates from Illinois and Indiana. Var
ious facts to prove these allegations
are cited in the brief of the com
plainants who petition the Commis
sion to call upon the railroads for a
reply to their charges, and to order
that the carriers abandon the proposed
increase and establish a reasonable
rate for the future.
The creation of a new judicial dis
trict in North Dakota is provided for
in a bill introduced in the House by
Representative Young of North Da
kota. This bill provides that there
shall be terms of Court annually in
theeastem- district at Fargo, Grand
Forks and Devils Lake and in the
western district at Bismarck, Dickin
son, Minot and Williston. The West
ern district is to be composed of the
counties of Bottineau, McHenry, Bur
leigh, Sheridan Emmons, Sioux, Mor
ton, Oliver, Mercer, McLean, Ward,
Montrail, Burke, Divide, Renville,
Williams, McKenzie, Dunn, Billings,
Golden Valley, Stark, Hettinger, Ad
ams, and Bowman, the remaining
portion of the state to constitute the
Eastern district.
The Eastern district as proposed inb
the bill includes Fargo, the home of
the present United States District
Judge.
It is understood that the creation of
a new judicial district in North Da
kota is supported by the leading Dem
ocrats, so there appears to an excell
ent chance for the pass- je of Mr.
Young's bill.
Fourth class post offices in North
Dakota have been advanced to the
presidential class, to take effect Jan.
1, 1916, as follows: Douglas, N. D.,
$1,100 Elgin, $1,100 Golden valley,
$1200 McVille, $1100 Noonan, $1100
Powers Lake, $1100 Turtle Lake $1,
200 Wishek $1100.
The 25,000 owners of automobile.?
in North Dakota, will be interested in
the investigations now being conduct
ed by the Federal Trade Commission
and the Department of Justice into
the causes for the increase in the price
of gasoline. Several resolutions call
ing for inquiries in to this subject will
also be introduced in Congress to as
certain if this increase has been brot
about by any violence of the Sherman
anti-trust law. It is well known that
the price of crude petroleum has in
creased greatly during the last couple
months, in some oil fields having dou
bled in value. The investigation* to
be made will develop all the facts.

Copenhagen, Jan. 4.—Members of
the Ford peace party no longer will be
able to charge unlimited accounts for
drinks to Henry Ford, and have him
meet the bills. Orders to this effect
were passed to the delegates yester
day.
Several women delegates who
bought clothes from Copenhagen mo
distes and charged them to the party's
account also were notified to settle
from their own purses.
The peace party has been getting
passports vised by Count Brockdorff
Ranszau, the German minister to Den.
mark, for the rail trip thru Germany
to The Hague.
This trip is to be taken entirely
without official sanction from the
United States government, and the
delegates are practically the guests of
the German government.
Many members of the party asked
Mr. Plantiff, Ford's manager, to give
them themOney equivalent instead of
first class passage to Rotterdam, but
they got only a flat refusal.
