I!
Fd Rather Be Square. v'
I'd rathei'i be square, and I wonder who wouldn't,
And yetlf it cost me what some people pay,
I'd like to be rich and find that I couldn't.
There's too hhuJi worth' while that is lost by. the way.
To sacrifice friends and ideals to surrender
Mv heart and mv conscience, uiv soul and mv mind
And sell all my dreams for a dollar-marked splendor
Would leave me too poor for the riches I'd find;
I'd like to be rich, there is pleasure in. money
It's good stall" to have, and it's gool stud' to spend,
It help 5tou to pay for your milk and your honey,
And gives you a chance to be nice to a friend.
I'd like to be rich, but I'd never bp willing . !
To pay such a price as some men do for gold
The co.-st is too high and the pace is too killing,
And too many things must be bartered and sold.

j. c Henley
In another column will be

tv Trustee. .1. C. Henley, as a
candidate for re-election at the
coming August elect ion.
The office of County Trustee is
one of the most, if not the most,
important office in the county,
The man who'has charge of coun-
try's finances is not only the
i custodian of the county's money,
but must be competent as well
to guard the treasury against,
political grafts and unwarranted
appropriations. The fact that
I very few who ask for this office
i are competent is proven by the
! large number of trustees who go
! broke and the refusal of guaran
tee companies to make bonds for
county trustees.
Mr. TIenlev has made an effi-
cient trustee. Ills books are
always in good condition and
open to every voters inspection.
We believe the people of Grundy
county are heartily tired of
PKTieiimentin with new ma-
i - -

when
they have a man to vote for who

and that they will give Mr. Hen-
ley the endorsement he asks for
at the coming August election,
