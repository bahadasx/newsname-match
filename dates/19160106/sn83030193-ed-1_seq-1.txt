trchwey by wholesale orders trans
ferring prominent members of the Slu
ts Welfare League to Dannemora
Prison, niley was at Sin Sins Pris
On when his subordinate received tho
tetter and communlcatod the gist of
It to him by telephone
The text of the Governor's letter
follows:
"X have Just been apprlsod of an
order made by you dlroctlng the
transfer from Slog Sins- to the
State I'riMon at Dannomora of
tity-slx convicts. Some of these,
u has been customary, uro trans
ferred as tubercular patients.
Most of thorn, It appears, have
been or are at present prominently
connected with tho Mutual Wol
. fare League of tho prison and are
regarded by tho Warden as trust
worthy and necessary, under pres
ent conditions, for tho proper ad
ministration of the affairs of the
prison. The Warden was not con
suited at all In this matter.
"It was distinctly understood
when Mr. Klrchwoy went to Sing
Sine, which ho did ut our earnest
solicitation, that ho ehould be
given opportunity thoroughly to
familiarize himself with the con
ditions, and, bo far as practicable,
, should have a free hund.
"You know as well as I that a
trios for from Sing Sing to Danne
mora, except In cases of tuber
oular patients, Is regarded as pun
ishment, and has been for years.
"Tour drastlo and proclpllato
action, without conferonco cither
with the Wardon or with the Gov
ernor, it seems to me, i bo in
spired by but one motive, and Its
affect, as you must know, If car
ried out, must bo to break down
tho administration and render tho
now Warden's, position intoler
able. I havo felt and still feel that
la your enfeebled condition of
health you may not altogether
realise the full effoct of your ofti
clal action on this and on other
occasions.
"But this order Is so clearly a
violation of our understanding
and of tho terms undor which Dr.
Klrohwey went to Sing Sing, ;u
well as, it eeoms to me, of your of
ficial obligation to the peoplo of
this Stato, that I deem It my duty
to ask for your Immediate reals
nation." The full text of the Governor's let

Prosperity and the Obviation
of Strikes the Double Reason
for the Advance.
The United States Bteel Corpora
tion to-day announced an nll-around
lnerex; of wngai lovjtsemplojrees',
averaging 10 per cent. The following
statement was issued by the com
pany: "In view of prosperous conditions
now CNlMIng, It was unanimously
voted at a meeting ot presidents of
our Iron and steel companies held to
day to recommend that thcro should
bo tnado adjustments of wage rates
to tako effect Feb. 1. At a subsequent
mooting of the finance committee It
won unanimously decided to adopt
tho recommendations of tbn presi
dents. "It Is pro;0!ed to Increase the rato
of wages of common laborers about
ID per cent. As to other departments
tho Increases will bo equitably pro
portioned. Adjustments In wage
rat c.i In our mining companies aro
under consideration."
For several days past Bteol shares
havo been weak in tho market on
rumors of ponding strlkos. The an
nounced adjustment of wages upward
at tbls time, It Is believed, will go a
long way towurd bettering labor con
ditions In tho stoel trado In goncral
and avoiding prospective trouble?."
About 200,000 men wilt bo affected
by tho tncroaso, it was said at tho
otllco of tho corporation, and It will

H '-'.000.000 annually to tho payrolls.

Tho steamship Patrls of tins Greek

'wireless from Copt. Zogoran to the
National Steam Navigation Company
of Greece, No. 30 Pcsrl Strait, this
morning states that at noon yester
day tho Patrls was 350 milos east of
Sandy Hook.
In his message C.ipt. Hagoras tells
of tho efforts of tho Patrls to tow tho
Thessalonlkl Into port, of tho break
ing of tho towing lines and the baf
fling search for the water-logged ves
sel In snow and fog. A wireless mes
sage fiom the United States of the
Scandinavian-American lino told ot
thn rescue of tho ninety members of
the crow of tho Thessalonlkl from
their foundering vessel by tho steam
ship Perugia of tho Anchor lino. The

serious menace to navigation. How
ever, should- the vessel not go to tho
bottom she will bo sunk with ex

sc.iroh ot tho vessel.
In his message to New York the
commander of tho Patrls nays ho

the Patrls could do nothing but stand

removal of tho passengers a score or
more of tho crew, mostly stewards,
wero taken aboard tho ('atria.
The Patrls then attached lines to
the Thessalonlkl and proceoded to
town tho disabled vessel into port.
During hoavy weather on Saturday
night the linos snapped, leaving the
Thessalonlkl to flounder helplessly
about Tho Patrls kept clobo to her

AND SHE FIRED NO SHOT
MARSUILLES, Jan. 6. The French steamer Karnak, carrying 259
passengers, was clused all night in the Mediterranean by a submarine.
She eluded the U-boat and arrived here to-dav.
- , She brought survivors' of the Drithh steamers Middlelo'n, ar.r'AbeUa;
sunk By a submarine. r 7 ' . '
The submarine abandoned the chase at dawn to-day. When the
Karnak put Into Marseilles many of the passengers were hysterical from
fright.
" The submarine sighted us at aljoul dusk last night," said one of
the Karnak's olficcr. "The captain ordered full steam ahead and we
raced for It through a heavy storm, our bow splitting big waves.
"PasEougors ami tho crows of tho Abelia and Mlddlcton, hating Just
oicapcd after their vessels hud been sunk, were so torror-strlckon their
plight wns pitiful. Hume of thn men gatherod ut tho storn when tho chase
begin and watched the submarine, hut numt of them wore too badly fright
ened to do su. Tlicro were .seventeen passengers and thirteen ot the crew
ul the Abelia and two survivors of the Mlddlcton.
"Tho submarine, waa about "3U Icet long. Apparently she was as fast
nt wo were, but tho big wuves bothered her and provod our salvation.
When the cliusu began wo could sco her ripping through the waves, some
times almobt hidden from night.
"All the passengers put on lifebelts und tho boats were swung out.
Everybody got fully dressed and sat in tho smoking room all night while
the Karnak rushed on (or Marseilles. Wo kept zigzagging to keep tho
submarlno from risking a chnnco shot at us."
Sinking of tho IlrtUsh Htcuraer Abelia was reported from London on

of tho Ilrlllah .steamer Mlddlcton, which displaced 2,606 tons and was regis

Tho Karnak is a C81C ton liner, owned by tho Messagleres Maritime
Company, and registorctl at Marseilles. Sho Is capable of making fifteen
knots. The fact that a bubmarine, In a storm, kept closo on her heols
throughout tho night, corroborates the statement ot one of her officers that
