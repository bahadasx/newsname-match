Washington, Jan. 6 Secretary Gar
rison laid before the house military af
fairs committee today his formal argu
ment in behalf of the administration's
army plan which is designed to give
the country a definite military policy.
If. proposes the creation of a mobile
federal force of more than a million
men in six years, accumulation of a
huge reserve of ammunition and equip
ment and elaborate extension of the
coast defenses, the whole project in
volving an increased expense of $000,
000.000 and an annual war department
budget thereafter of more than $200,
000,000 as compared with an average
of $100,000,000 for the last few years.
"The integrity of the nation and its
very existence," the secretary said,
reading from a lengthy statement he
had prepared, "may depend on what
is done in this matter at this time.
This great opportunity will be lost un
less a wise, sensible and . practical
policy is the result of the considera
tion and action of this congress."
Must Stand Ready to Act.
Referring to the far spread military
responsibilities of the nation, reaching
into the insular possessions, China,
Alaska and the Panama canal zone,
Mr. Garrison added:
"We have determined and announced
that the sovereignty of the other re
publics on this hemisphere shall re
main invoilable, and must therefore
at all times stand ready to make good
our position in this connection." He
then quoted figures to show the full
strength of the army on June 30 last
105,993 officers and men of the com
batant forces, and their present distri
bution. To these should be added, he
said 1,183 officers and 17,818 men of the
non-combatant arms of the service,
bringing the total number of federal
troops up to 124,994. He pointed out
that the item of pay alone made up
approximately 50 per cent of the to
tal proposed appropriations.
Mentions Vast Area.
The United States, including Alaska,
said the secretary, is of greater area
than the combined total of Austro
Hungary, Belgium, the British Isles,
Bulgaria. Denmark, France, Germany,
Greece, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Russia
in Europe, Spain and Turkey in Eu
rope, the total of these areas repre
senting only 97 per cent of that of
the United States.
"It will be conceded," he added, "by
anyone who admits that military force
is requisite at all, that our present one
is totally inadequate."
As to the national guard. Md. Garri
son said:
"At the present time this force con
sists of approximately 129,000 men and
officers and it would therefore be nec
essary if it is to be expanded to 400,000
to add 271,000 men and officers."
Mr. Garrison pointed out that the
national guard could be called in fed
eral service only for three purposes,
to suppress domestic insurrection, to
enforce the law and to repel invasion.
Asks m,0(!0 Men Annually.
The secretary outlined the conti
nental army plan which proposes to
raise 400,000 men in annual increments

silent before through fear of being
shot.
The robbery was planned, according

ITALIAN SHIP
WITH 2 GUNS
AT NEW YORK
Liner Docks at United States
Port in Violation of the
Neutrality Decree.
WASHINGTON MAY ACT
Steps to Be Taken to Have
Cannon Removed Before
Leaving America.
Washington, Jan. 6. The state
department probably will take up
with the Italian government the
question of guns mounted on the
liner Giuseppe Verdi with a flew
to having the pieces dismounted
before the ship leaves American
waters.
New York, Jan. 6. Gunners of the
royal Italian navy were in charge of
the two guns on the Italian liner Giu
seppe Verdi which arrived here today
from Genoa, Naples and Palermo, ac
cording to the captain, Luigl Zan
noni. After the vessel left Palermo,
the captain said, daily practice was
held with the guns, barrels having
been thrown overboard as targets.
The guns were placed on the ves
sel by order of the Italian naval au
thorities but the captain said he was
instructed to use them for defensive
purposes only.
The guns on the Verdi promise
to bring up again a point
which has been a disputed one
since the war began. At outset of
hostilities the United States took the
position that ships entering American
ports with guns of not more than six
inches in calibre, mounted well aft for
purposes of defense, would not be con
sidered armed, but reserved the right
to change its position in the light of
changing conditions of warfare and the
introduction of new elements such a
the submarine campaign.
State department officials expressed
the view today that the Italian gov
ernment would probably be asked in
formally to dismount the guns on the
Verdi before she sails from the United
States.
Good at Shooting Barrels.
The two gunners became extremely
proficient in the practice of shooting at
the barrels, passengers said. The guns
were mounted on the after-house of
the vessel, on on either side, and were
in such position as to command all
positions from the ship.
The captain described the guns as
having a calibre of 77 mm., capable
of firing a shell weighing 65 kilos four
and one-half miles.
When the Gieuseppe Verdi docked
here, F. A. Dowsey, a member of the
port neutrality squad, inspected the
guns and reported his information to
Dudley Field Malone, collector of the
port. The guns are still on the ship
and no action will be taken by local
officials until a report of the investi
gation has been made to Washington.
After leaving Palermo on Dec. 24, all
lights on the vessel were carefully
concealed and during the daytime the
steamer covered a round-about course
for the purpose of avoiding hostile
submarines.
Officers reported having encountered
terrific northwest and west gales dur
ing a considerable portion of the voy
age and the high seas smashed several
of the liner's life boats and put out of
commission the telephone system be
tween the bridge and the pilot house
and engine room.
Had Stormy Voyage.
The French liner La Touraine, which
sailed from Bordeaux on Dec. 2$ also
arrived a few days late, having been
held up by the gales which have raged
over the Atlantic in the past two
weeks. On Dec. 30 the liner encounter
ed what the officers described as a
whole gale, or a wind velocity of about
ninety miles an hour, and the steamer
was forced to heave to for 20 hours.
Between the Grand Banks and the
Nantucket shoals lightship, the liner
was constantly in a heavy storm which
alternated between hail and snow.
COMPTROLLER'S CALL
MADE MORE EXACTING
Washington, Jan. 6. In today's call
the comptroller for the statement of
condition of national banks goes
further than at any previous time to
learn If money Is being loaned by na
tional banks in violation of state usury
laws. He asks for a list of loana by
all banks during 1915, "upon which
interest was charged or collected,
either in the shape of Interest, dis
count or commission, at rates which
would amount to more than the
equivalent of six per cent per an
num."
