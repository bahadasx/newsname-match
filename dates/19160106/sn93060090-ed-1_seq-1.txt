The world ot people- to day is

Dear Beader,
Tfc mav look strange to yon
why we repeat our work in the
scripture and in a scriptorial
line. But we wish to say to you
that we have but one story to
tell and tbat is Christ and him
crucified The cause of bis
crucifixion . And thru him the
redemption of his people in the
last days bv the restitution of all
things spoken ot by nil the Holy
prophets since the world, hegan.l
The truth has been cast to the
ground, and it must be lifted up
And stood erect before the eyes
oi the world. So if you see the
truth repeated over an overflgam
in the columns of the Cresset,
thinks it not strange, For that
is what we and the Colony people
have labored for these 20 years
jiast and we and they are not
tired yet,
So bere goes for 20 years more
if necessary for to bring to the
World peace and good will to
ward men. For we want to see
the new heaven and new earth
where in Dwelleth Rightousntss.
So readers think it not strodge
tbat we repeat or th it we. will
stop this work until old men
and old woman will lem on their
fctaff in Jsrusa'em for very a,?e
and the streets be full of girls
and boys playing .there in.
If we could be made to believe
that the preparedness the war
Europe made before they, went
into the slaughter pens to kill and
murder each other would restore
the millions of deadback to life
and to their families and give the
widows and orphants health and
plenty of bread, and warm cloths
we then would change our minds
and say build all the gun boats,
make all tbe cannons ycii can.
And manufacture as much am
unition as could be made.
Without this insurance, do
not ask us to believe in
preparedness. For the great
Dragon made the first prepara-
ion. And to restore peace it took
the Blood of Jesus to make the
preparation, for the peace that
is yet to come. Which is spoken
of in this manner.
' For brass I will bring g'jld
and for iron I will bring silver.
and for wood brass, and for
stones iron ; 1 will also make thy
officers peace, and thine exac
tors righteouness.
.Violence shall no mora be
heard ln tny 'anJ aatinK nor
destruction within thy borders:
but tbou sbalt call thy walls
Salvation, and thy gates Praise.
Tbe sun shall be no more thy
light by day, neither for bright
ness shall tbe moon give light
untj tbee: but the Lord shall be
unto thee and everlasting light,
and thy God thy glory.
Tby sun shall no more go,
down, neither shall thy moon
withdraw itself; for the Lord
shall be thine everlasting light,
and the days of thy mourning
shall be ended.
Tby people also shall be all
righteous; they, shall inherit
the land forever, tbe branch of
my planting, the work of my
hands that I may be glorified-

quainted with tha works of mam
of serving the condition of the
churches, fusing them drifting
farther away rom cod, I could
no longer be a pasto and refuse
$300. and a parsonage, rather go
oufe ad preach Christ to the
noor and suffer with them in
their afflictions. Even like Mo

longer. The Lord spoke . to mo
saying f jifow mu. I went out to
meet my Lord on the first meet-
Who among us Hooscrs
not feel our heart thrill
l with emotion and tenderness,'
when the strains of tbat classi
cal peace are heard and who
among us does not remember
the time when as youngsters
we saw the cabin lights gleaming
thru tbe sycamore as we trudged
home from our days toil in tbe
cranberry fields or from a tussle
with a bear in the Elderberry
swamps,
There is a kind of a sad feeling
comes over me when I remember
my early childhood and boyhood
days Bro, MeClure remembers
them too, and wbiks I hare flot
had the opportunity of reading
any of his Blackstonian Articles
intf was held the Lorrl came to ' of !ate in the CUKsSliT; i know
me and told me I had overcome h wuld l,e tflad to indorse any
evertbicg he had ever ask int, toeing I might say about this
do, and now I could sit down.here town Its early inhabitants
with him in his throne even as !aud settlers among whom were
he overcame and sit down with'
the Father in his throne. The
power fell all -over the country
and 26 was1 resurrected from
the dead in, sin and trespass;?!?,
and were all made to sit together
in heavenly places.
Now I realize it would not be
lone until the Lord would re
the Indians of the La Fontaine
tribe a;:d it is the writers own
pnviledgu to have played Golf
and dismal day of inactivity, but
now we are worse than ever
as they are getting more and
more grasping every day, and
you cant get a loan any more un
less you go with somebody whe
can vouch for you and then yoc
have got to put up some collater-'
al that vou might not ever get
back in your possession or safety
first deposit box again.
No doubt the Ed. knows how
idis is. as i rememoer ce was
trying to get a loan some months
ago, and it is certainly hard to
get it where there is some one
presaut who wont part with ,
their shekel, Speaking of shek
els that reminds me of the Two
Man Theory, for you cant get a
loan of shekels unless there are
two men present, and it is my
Icauseusus of opinions that Icon-
cur with the Editor in, and hope
that other brothers ma use
these columns to freely express
their ideas on this important
subject, Bros, MeClure, and'
other Indiana scribes please note
and lets deluge tbe Editor with
scatering Articles. We know
tile Editor has a warm spot in
his heart for tho Huosicr Col
umn, and there should never be
pn issue that did not carry some
messagu of cheer, fellowship,
good will, of verosity and chari
tableness. Lets all remember
to be charitable at tins time of
the yf'iir, remembering those
great virtues, Faith, Hope and
