The Struggle Abroad
CALL WRITER FINED
LONDON.—J. T. Walton Nowbold,
Socialist, was fined $125 on charges
brought by Samuel James, superlni
tendent of police, based on a lettej
which he had mailed to The New
York Call and which was intercepted
by agents of the police after It was
deposited in the postoffice at Buxton.
Newbold pleaded guilty of the charge
of violating the Defense of the Realm
Act. The alternative of serving; three
months in prison or paying the fine
was presented him. His parents paid
the fine.
Newbold, who was a valued corre
spondent of The Call, exhorted Amer
ica to refuse to make munitions for
any of the belligerents in Europe In
the letter which was seized.
G. B. SHAW SPEAKS OUT
"Build thirty-two dreadnoughts in
stead of sixteen; spend $2,000,000,000
on your armament program. Instead
of $1,000,000,000." This Is Geo. Ber
nard Shaw's advice to the United
States, contained In a letter to the
intercollegiate Socialist Society.
Shaw sees in America's pacifism the
hope of the world, "but," he adds, "It
is because American is powerful as
well as pacific that she will be list
ened to."

Comrade Ken. Leslie is a member
of the Australasian Socialist party.
He had a leaflet published entitled

trial being that he was sentenced, by
■ most virtuous and patriotic magis- i
trate, to six months' hard labor or:
$500 fine, this being the full penalty ;
permitted by the War Precautions'
Act.

SOCIALISM IN RELATION
TO WORLD PROBLEMS
(WRITTEN ESPECIALLY FOR THE NORTHWEST WORKER)
A GLIMPSE OF CONFLICTING
REASONS
The German Socialists were the
flrsi to initiate discussions concern-
Ing the practical steps which the revo
lutionary workers might take In a
conflict between Internationalism and
nationalism, particularly In matten
of militarism and war, (ionium dole
gates from Switzerland to the UniH
sds congress of the old Internationa]
in 1888 placed these questions on the
order of business. They were rx
haustlvely debated by the delegates,
turned over to a committee, and em
bodied In a resolution brought In by
the committee and adopted by tim
riingross.
The Socialist party representatives
in the German reichstag, in 1870, j
were the first, to face the question:
what to do when war wb* about to
bp declared, and to attempt a practi
cal solution of the difficulty present
ed by the distinction between a de
fensive and an offensive war.
In these discussions, all sides at
these Questions were thoroughly air
ed. Later debates added nothing es
sential. Practically all the reasons j
and possible steps debatable for So
cialists were mentioned in these first
debates. All subsequent debates con
cerning theso subjects at national
party conventions, international con
gresses, or in regular Socialist inaga-!
sdnes and papers, have merely repeat- <
ed those old debates In a more or
less complete form under different
conditions.
When the old International held
its Brussels congress, in 1868, the
following practical measures against
war were suggested by delegates of
different nationalities: (1) Public
protests for the purpose of lining the i
mass of the people up against the rul
ing classes; (2) refusal of military
service; (3> strikes in war industries;
(4) strikes in all industries; (5) gen
eral propaganda of fundamental So
cialist principles.
The only immediately practical
measure recommended by the resolu-1
tion of the committee was "cessation
of all work" in case of war, in other
words: "Strike of the nations against
war."
In the discussions it was argued
that protests should be made, of
course, at all times, but such pro
tests could not have any practical ef
fect in stopping war, so long as the
revolutionary workers were in a small
minority and the governing powers
were not in their hands. Refusal of
military service was rejected for the
simple reason that In most European
countries the laws made it punishable
as a felony. On the other hand, since
a mere protest was useless, and since
the fundamental Socialist propaganda
did not touch the vast majority of
workers in all countries, nothing prac
tical remained to be done but to
strike. Strikes were not illegal.
Strikes also offered the additional
advantage that workers of all ages
could take part in them, whereas a
military strike would affect only

those of military ago. Furthermore,
ii strike would be backed by many
labor unions, and this would bring
about a better understanding between
labor unions and Socialists. As for
the rest, wan could bi fundamentally
abolished only l>y > complete social
revolution, and this wat< a matter of
a long historical development.
Man and Engels did not attend the
Brussels congress of the old Inter
national, but worn Informed of its
deliberations by delegate Eccarlus, j
who lived in the London exile with
them. The first reporta or Eccarlus
were published In the London
"Times." When M:.rx and Engels
read these reports, they suspected at
first that ibe congress had been dom
lnated by the French and Belgian
delegates under the Influence of|
Proudhonian Ideas. In reality, the
most impractical suggestion, that of
strikes In military Industries, had
been made by their German lieuten
ant in Switzerland, J. P. Becker, and
the French and Belgian delegates
had been most emphatic in their re
jection of such naive schemes. The
Idea of striking in all industries seem
ed "nonsense" to Marx and Engels.
It was, indeed, nonsense under the
then prevailing conditions, and it has
remained nonsense to this day, al
though it has been made again and j
again, even in very recent days, with
the additional claim that general
strikes and refusal to enlist constitut
ed the "only true international So
cialist attitude."
GENERAL STRIKF, «*I.JTII-E AS
WAR PREVENTIVE
The Brussels resolution of the old
International had no practical effect
upon the working class whatever.
Marx and Engels considered this en-1
tire attitude quite as Utopian as the
bourgeois pacifism or the impossi
bilist demand of "peace at any price,"
so long as Russian Tsarism and bu
reaucracy continued to menace Eu
rope with wars of conquest. Marx
and Erigels considered disarmament
impractical for the same reasons and
demanded a national militia in place
of the standing armies. Of this more
anon. The main point at this stage
is the irrefutable record that, even
in its first debates of these questions,
the Socialist leadership in the vast
majority agreed that the working
class can do nothing practical, under
capitalist rule, to stop wars, and that
wo must make the best of a bad sit
uation by registering our protest and
continuing our fundamental Socialist j
propaganda.
The war of 1870 did not produce
the results which Marx-Engels, Bebel
and Liebknecht would have desired.
They still clung to the hope that a
Greater Germany with a Democratic
constitution might be produced by
this upheaval. History decided oth
erwise. Marx-Engels accepted the in
evitable rather philosophically, but
Be'bel and Liebknecht in those days
were great impossibilists. Lieb
knecht especially at times expressed
views about parliamentarian politics

, which resembled plain anarchism so
i closely that some of his speeches,
! lorn out of their context, were actual
i ly quoted by anarchists in support of
f their own anti-political views. Even
i in our own day, Liebknecht's wrlt-
I ings are still the favorite textbook of
r nil Impossibilists.
LIEBKNECHT AGAINST CREDITS
Liebknecht was the only German
Socialist In 1870 who demanded a vote
against the war credits from the So
'jciaiist representatives. Bebel re,
l'lised to vote against the war credits
because such a vote would have Kig
uified practical partisanship In favor
of Napoleon, Bebel persuaded Lieb
knecht to be satisfied with a protest
ngalnst the war and abstain from
,j voting. Both of them thought that
this w;;r wan altogether a dynastic
\ \ enterprise of Napoleon and the Ho
henzollerns. This was a mistake.
Even the executive of Bebel's and
Liebknecht's own party realized this.
The party executive foresaw that a
German empire would come out of
this war. On their part, the mem
bers of this executive erred when
they hoped that all Germans, even
those of Austria, would be included
in the new empire, or that the peo
ple would gain substantial political
concessions. Marx-Engels wanted to
see Napoleon beaten, because they
calculated that a German victory
would make things easier for the
European labor movement than a vic
tory of France and a France dominat
ed by Russian diplomacy. They
agreed with that part of an editorial
in the "Socialdemocrat" which ex
plained that "a victory of Napoleon
would mean a defeat of the Socialist
workers of France, would make Napo
leon's soldiers almighty in Europe,
and would dismember Germany com
pletely."
This reflection impelled the major
ity of German Socialists to vote for
the war credits, because they had to
take a practical part in the national
affairs, and because mere protests or
the simple propaganda of Socialist
fundamentals were useless in such a
situation.
This repudiation of the impossibll
ist attitude of Bebel and Liebknecht
by Marx-Engels and by the majority
of the German Socialist representa
tives in 1870 showed good sense and
a better grasp of historical necessi
ties than former declarations of So
cialist leaders had done. Of course,
being dictated also by excessive ex
pectations of greater Democracy, it
did not show as much historical fore
sight as one might expect of a soberly
calculating social scientist. At least
it was more practical than Lieb
knecht's impossibilist views on par
liamentarian politics. If he had been
correct, then the logical thing to do
would have been to stay out of par
liament and out of politics altogether.
Liebknecht had, Indeed, for a while,
entertained the grotesque idea to
walk into the reichstag, protest In
the name of the working class against

YOU GET WHAT
YOU VOTE F^OR
BY FRED T. MACFEELY
Don't cry and complain when things go wrong
Nor drown your troubles with wine, women and song'
I'or no matter what you do your whole life long
You're sure to get what you vote for.
If you go to the polls on election day
And cast your ballot the old party way,
Remember the Socialists when you heard them say
"You'll get just what you vote for."
When your boss lays you off without a red cent
Not even enough money to pay a month's rent-
Ami you walk through the streets 'till your poor' back is bent
You re getting just what you voted for.
But if you'll work for Socialism with all your might
And you sing it and talk it both day and night-
Depend upon this, you're doing quite right,
You'll get just what you vote for.
BIG DOINGS
FISH POND SOCIAL TO BE
HELD FOR BENEFIT OF
NORTHWEST WORKER
Fun, and lots of it, will drive dull
care away. That is why we are going
to have a Fish Pond Social next
Sunday.
Fishing for SUCKERS? Well,
hardly. We have no use for SUCK
ERS in the Socialist movement, so
why fish for them?
All the fish in the pond will be
good and serviceable. Some of them
will be very valuable. Nobody will
be disappointed with his or her catch
if we can help it.
If you are looking for a husband,
come around and try your luck. If
you want a wife, why this is your
chance.
Do you appreciate good music? If
you do, then this is the place to get
it. Yes, there will be iovs of it.
Maybe you like recitations better?
We have got the pick or Everett for
recitations, so again we are right
there with the goods.
Do you care for a light refresh
ment? No? Very well, then, please
yourself. But if you should change
your mind, some sweet young lady1
will be only too pleased to serve you.
If you do not care for this kind of
amusement, then be a thousand miles
away from The Forum next Sunday
evening; because if you are not, you
will be compelled to follow the crowd
to the Big Doings.
THE FIRST SHOT
Local Kelso fires the first shot
in the 1916 campaign.
In response to our letter for an
energetic campaign, Local Kelso
sends in a list of 52 names and ad
dresses for a treatment of Socialism.
We will deliver the goods as per
orders and if we do not get some real
fighting material out of this bunch
of names we will make Teddy Roose
velt an honorary member of the So
cialist party.
FOR OUR STURDY KID
Comrade H. Thorsen of Arlington
sends in a dollar to keep "our sturdy
kid" in good physical condition so
that we can "punch a hole through
the brain of every confounded Henry
Dubb." He also enclosed the names
of two Henry Dubbs and the money to
pay for their education to their true
position in human society.

SEATTLE COMRADES
SHOW APPRECIATION
SHIPLEY LECTURES DREW BIG
AUDIENCE DESPITE INCLEM
ENT WEATHER
Notwithstanding the cold and in
clement weather of last Sunday, the
third lecture in Shipley's "Nebula to
Man" series drew a large and appre
ciative audience to Stevens Hall to
hear the discussion on the question,
"Is Man Cousin to the Ape?" Seattle
was still full of the holiday spirit, and
many of its citizens had not yet re
covered from Friday night's excite
ment, to say nothing of Saturday
night's "turkey and." But those who
heard the two lectures preceding Sun
day's were not to be easily turned
away from the third. So there was
much joy in the face of the comrades
who have the lectures in charge as
the large audience filed into the hall.
And they were ctill more ecc.ouraged
when they heard the remarks of ap
preciation of those present, at the
conclusion of the lecture. "You'll see
standing room only next Sunday," en
thusiastically proclaimed one of the
committee.
The fourth lecture will treat of the
evolution of man's tools of production
and distribution, and the social and
economic changes incident thereto.
How the development of machine-pro
duction leads inevitably to the rise
and fall of capitalism, and the ulti
mate inauguration of Socialism, will
be clearly explained and illustrated.
Not less than 80 remarkable, thought
provoking stereopticon views will be
exhibited during the lecture, graphi
cally presenting vital economic truths.
No intelligent man or woman can see
these pictures and hear them explain
ed without being forced to the convic
tion that the early triumph of Social
ism is inevitable.
WATCH OUR SMOKE
The Northwest Worker is prepar
ing for big things in the propaganda
line.
We want to make this year the
most active year in the history of
the Socialist movement. We want
to fill everybody to the brim with
enthusiasm.
Enthusiasm is what counts —and a
half-dozen speakers touring the state
will create enthusiasm.
We will co-operate with the state
office, no matter who gets the office.
We will co-operate with the locals,
no matter what local it is. We are
in the field to boost for Socialism—
and we are going to do it with all the
power and money at our disposal.
Line up your forces, get your cam
paign committees elected, build up
your membership. (Jive everybody In
the local something to do. Apathy is
what kills any movement; bury it by
putting everybody to work.
Let us elect several state legisla
tors. It's easy if we get enough
workers with enthusiasm. Gut busy.
Ten months will soon slip by. Get
an early start so that we can gather
up speed as we go along. Let's land
on the old parties with such a blow
as will knock all the wind out of
their sails. Everybody get busy!
When we get a strong military or
ganization we will have a military
rule. Then let anyone dare to criti
cise the looters of the workers and he
will follow Joe Hill.
