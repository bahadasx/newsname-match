Parkersburg, W. Va., Jan. 6.
Captain Brady M. Berry, and sixty
two of the passengers and crew of
the steamer Kanawha which sank in
the Ohio river last night arrived here
early to-day on a train sent out to j
pick up the survivors scattered along |
four miles of river front on the West
Virginia cide. Captain S-Jerry said |
that while he saw no one in the water
and did not know that any had been j
lost he felt there had been fatalities. J
"We were moving down stream I
with the flood last night with a crew |
of about 40 men and some 20 pas-1
sengers ou board,' 1 said Captain Berry, j
"Just as we were approaching the I
lower end of a lock wall on the West I
Virginia side, we were struck by a
severe storm and the Kanawha had
struck an iron pier and started to
sink.
Kolloil Over unci Over
"I shouted for the boats. The cries
of the passengers roused the men at
the lock. They put out and came to
our assistance. We managed to get
the people on the hurricane deck and
fis the Kanawha turned on her side
kept them moving toward the top |
while wo were taking them off. The '
Kanawlia continually turned andl
when we finally got the last man
pshorc he was clinging to the bottom i
of tli° boat ns she had turned com-!
pletely over and was drifting down
stream bottom-side up.
"An hour or more elapsed from the j
lime we struck until all were off and I
passengers and crew were constantly I
being landed on the river shore until i
survivors, shivering in the cold, were
t strung out through a distance of four [
miles. When I saw that all were off
T shouted to the crew who had taken
the last load away and they came
' back and got me.
"The twelve women were taken off
first and then the men as we were
able lo move them. Some of the
crew said that a boatload landed on
the Ohio side, but I don't know."

torpedoed came from one of the olli- 1

Jitney Bonds Cost
$200; No Unlicensed

not a single bond has been presented
to City Solicitor I). S. Seitz for ex

until January 18 to comply with the

rumor got about to-day that the city

filing of a jitney bond. City officials

.be required to file a ?2,000 bond as
.the ordinance prescribes," It was said
at the city solicitor's office. "This
must be done by not later than
January 18 in order to operate a ve

streets."
The jitney bonds it is understood
will cost about S2OO unless collateral
