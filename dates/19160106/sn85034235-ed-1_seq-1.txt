tale ran. Surprise lake was a hoodoo;
its location was uuremembered, and
the gold still paved its undrained bot
tom.
Two Cabins, no less mythical, was
more definitely located. "Five sleeps"
up the McQuestion river from the
Stewart stood two ancient cabins. So
ancient were they that they must have j
been built before ever the first known j

basin. Wandering moose hunters,

with, claimed to have found the two

cabins in the old days, but to have
sought vuiuly for the mine which those
early adventurers must have worked.
"I wish you was goin - with me."
Shorty said wistfully at parting, ".lust j

hoodoo's sure on it. from the first flip
to the last call."
"It's all right. Shorty," replied
Smoke. "HI make the round trip and
be back in Dawson in six weeks."
A week later Smoke found bimself
among the jumbled ranges south of
Indian river. On the divide from the
Klondike he had abandoned the sleu
and packed his wolf dogs. The six big
huskies each carried fifty pounds, and
on his own back was an equal burden

packing it down under his snowshoes.
and behind, in single file, toiled the
dogs.
For days he wandered through a
chaos of canyons and divides which
did not yield themselves to any ra
tional topographical plan.
Then came a mountain storm that
blew a blizzard across the riffraff of
high and shallow divides. Above tim
ber line, tireless, for two days he strug
gled blindly to find lower levels. On
the second day he came out upon the
rim of an enormous palisade. So thick
ly drove the snow that lie could not see
the base of the wall, nor dared he at
tempt the descent. He rolled himself
in his robes and huddled the dogs about
him in the depths of a snowdrift, but
did not permit himself to sleep.
In the morning, the storm spent, be
crawled out to investigate. A quarter
of a mile beneath him. beyond all mis
take, lay a frozen, snow covered lake
About it. on every side, rose jugged
peaks. It answered the description
Blindly be had found Surprise lake.
"Well named." he muttered an hour
later as he came out upon its margin
A clump of aged spruce was the only
woods, in his way to it he stumbled
upon three graves, snow buried, hut
marked by hand hewn beadposts and
undecipherable writing.
On the edge of the woods was a
small, ramshackle cabin. He pulled the
latch and entered. In a corner, on
what had once been a bed of spruce
bough, still wrapped in mangy furs
that had rotted to fragments, lay a
skeleton. The last visitor to Surprise
lake, was Smoke's conclusion as he
picked up a lump of gold as large as
his doubled fist Beside the lump was
I a pepper can filled with nuggets of the
size of walnuts, rough surfaced, show
ing no signs of wash.
So true had the rale run that Smoke
accepted without question that t he
source of the gold was the lake's hot
tom. Under many feet of ice and in
accessible, there was nothing to he
done, and at midday, from the rim of
the palisade, he took a farewell look
back and down at his find
"It's all right. Mr. Lake." he said
"Yon just keep right on staying there
I'm coming hack to drain you-if that
hoodoo doesn't catch me. I don't know
how I got here, but I'll know by the
way I go out''
In a little valley beside a frozen
stream and under beneficent spruce
trees he built a fire four days later
Somewhere in that white anarchy lie
bad left behind him was Surprise
.lake— somewhere, he knew not where,
for a hundred hours of drifting and
struggle through blinding, driving
snow had concealed his courée from
i.im. and he. knew not in wfytt direc
tion lay behind Ä
The storm had passed, and it had
tarned clear and cold. The creek he
was on was natural in appearance and
trended, as it should, toward the south
west. Half a day's journey-down the
creek brought him to the valley of a
larger stream, which he decked was
the McQuystion Here he.;*'shot a
taon si-, and once again eaehjwolfdog
carrfid a full fifty pound paefc ®f meat.
As he turned down the MteQuestion
he came upon a sled trail. 'The late
snows had drifted over, big under
neath it was well packed by travel.
Ilis conclusion was that t\xp camps
had been established on tbecMcQues
tion and that this was the connecting
trail. Evidently Two Cabins had been
found, and it was the lower flamp. so
he headed down the stream. ;
It was 40 below zero when he camp
ed that night, and he fell as Veep won
dering who were the men who'had re
discovered the Two Cabins and if he
would fetch it next day. At the first
hint of dawn he was under wvy, easily
following the half obliteratufLtrail?
And then it came, the unexpected,
leaping out upon Inm on a bopd of the
river. It seemed to him that he heard
and felt simultaneously. 'Tht^raek of
the rifle came from the right; and the
bullet, tearing through and across the
shoulders of his drill palka ithd wool
en coat, pivoted him half ar^Bhd with
the shock of its impact. H«? staggered
his twisted snowshoes tq recover
balance and heard a second^cmck of
the rifle. This time if was a clean
miss. He did not wait for Store, but
plunged across the snow for .the shel
tering trees of the bank a biUÄyed feet
away
He climbed the bank, the dogs floun
dering behind, and dodged to among
the trees and brush. Slipping out of
his snowshoes. he wallowed forward
at full length and peered furiously
out.. Nothing was to be seen. - Whoev
er had shot at him was lying quiet
among the trees of the opposite bank.
"If something doesn't happen pretty
soon.'' he muttered at the -of half
an hour. "I'll have to sneak *way and
build.a fire or freeze my fee«*'
He crawled back a few yards, pack
ed down the snow, danced 4 jig that
sent the blood back into h iS feet and
managed to endure another half hour.
Then from duwn the river he heard
the unmistakable jingle of dog bells.
Peering out. he saw a sled round the
bend. Only one man was in it, strain
ing at the gee pole and urging tho
dogs along. j,
The effect
seen since lie parted from Shorty
three weeks before. His next thought
was of the potential murderer conceal
ed on the opposite bank.
Without exposing himself Smoke
whistled warningl.v. The man did not
hear and came on rapidly. Again and
more sharply Smoke whistled. The
man wlioacd his dogs, stopped andihad
turned and faced Smoke when tbefifle
cracked. The instant afterward Snjoke
fired into the woods in the direction of
the sound.
The man on the river had been
struck by the first shot The shock
of the high velocity bullet staggered
him. He stumbled awkwardly to the
sled, half falling, and pulled a rifle out
from under tlie lashings. As he strove
to raise It to his shoulder he crumpled
at the waist and sank down slowly to
a sitting posture on the sled. Then
abruptly, as the gun went off aimless
ly, he pitched backward and across the
corner of the sled load, so that Sifioke
could see only his legs and stomach.
From below came more jingling
bells. The man did not move. Around
the bend swung three sleds, accompa
nied by half a dozen men. Sifioke
cried warningly,'but they had seetj the
condition of the first sled, and they
dashed on to it
No shots came from the other bank,
and Smoke, calling his dogs to follow,
emerged into the open. There were
exclamations from the men. and two
of them, flinging off the mittens of
their right hands, leveled their rifles
at him.
"Come on, you red handed murderer,
you." one of them, a black bearded
man. commanded. "An' jest pitch that
gnn of yourn in the snow."
Smoke hesitated, then dropped his
rifle and came up to them.
"Go through him. Louis-, an' take hi«
weapons,
derod.
Louis was a French Canadian vqy
ageur. Smoke decided, as were four of
the others. His search revealed on9y
Smoke's hunting knife, which was flp
propria'ted.
"Now. what have you got to say f)r
yourself, stranger, before I shoot yii
dead?" tlie black bearded man (»

head. "Nope it won't do. Turn him j

from Smoke's belt.
"That's plain enough evidence, stran

nosed and steel jacketed. It's a 30-30;
yourn is 30-30. It's manufactured by
the J. & T. Arms company; yourn is

company Now, you come along, an'
we'll go over to the bank an' see jest
how you done it."
"1 was bushwhacked myself." Smoke
said. "Look at the bole in my parka."
While Blackbeard examined it one of
the voyagers threw open the breech of
the dead man's gun. It was patent to
all that it had been tired once. The
empty cartridge was still in the chain
her.
"A d--shame poor .loe didn't get
you." Blackbeard said bitterly. "But
he did pretty well with a hole like that
in him. Come on. you."
"Search tlie other bunk first," Smoke
urged.
"You shut up an' come on. an' let tfie
facts do the talkin'."
They left the trail at the same spot
be had and followed it on up the bank
and in among the trees.
"Him dance that pluce keep him feet
warm." Louis pointed out "That
place him crawl on belly. That place
him put.one elbow vr'eu him shoot.'
"'And there's the empty cartridge he
done it with!", was Blackbeard' s dis
covery. "Boys, there's only one thing
to do. We're decertt and law abidin',
an' we got to handle this right an' reg

him an' poor .Joe back to Two Cabins
I reckon we've seen an' can testify to
what'll stretch his neck."
mnyi|( er dark, when
arrived at TWO^fßVns , the star
light Smoke could make* *ut a dozen
or more recently built cabins snuggling
about a larger and older cabin on a
flat by the river bank. Thrust inside
this older cabin, he found it tenanted
by a young giant of a man. his wife
nnd an old blind man
The woman, whom her husband call
ed Lucy, was herself a strapping crea
ture of the frontier type. The old
man. as Smoke learned afterward, had
been a trapper on the Stewart for years
and had gone finally blind the winter
before. The camp of Two Cabins, he
was also to learn, had been made the
previous fall by a dozen men who ar
rived in half as many poling boats
loaded with provisions Here they had
found the blind trapper on the site of
Two Cabins, and about his cabin they
had built their own.
In five minutes all the men of Two
Cabins were jammed into the room
Smoke, shoved off into a corner, ignor
ed and scowled at. his hands and feet
tied with thongs of moose hide, look
ed on. Thirty-eight men he counted, a
wild and husky crew. His captors told
the tale over and over, each the center
of an excited and wrathful group.
It was while counting the men that
Smoke caught sight of a familiar face.
It was Brack, the man whose boat
Smoke had run through the rapids on
the way to Dawson He wondered
why the other did not come and speak
to him. but bimself gave no sign of
recognition. Later, when, with shield
ed face. Breck passed him a wink.
Smoke understood..
Blackbeard. whom Smoke heard call
ed Eli nnrding. ended the discussion
as to whether or not the prisoner
should be immediately lynched. "Hold
on!" be roared "Keep your shirts ira.
That man belongs to me. 1 caught
him. an I brought him here. 1
brought him here for a fair an' im

CHAPTER VIII.
A Friend In Need.
MOKE woke up. A draft that
possessed all the rigidity of an
icicle was boring into the front
of his shoulders us he lay on
bis side facing the wall When lie had
been tied into the bunk there had been
no such draft, and now the outside air
was sufficient advertisement that some
one from without had pulled away the
moss chinking between the logs. He
squirmed as far as bis bonds would
permit, then craned bis neck forward
until his lips just managed to reach
the crack. \
"Who is it?" he whispered.
"Breck. Be careful you don't make
I noise. I'm going to pass a knife in
o you."
"No good." Smoke said. "My bauds
are tied behind me and made fast to
the leg of the bunk. But something
must be doue. Those fellows are of a
temper to hung me. and. of course, you
i know I didn't kill that man."
"lt wasn't necessary to mention it.
Smoke. 1 want to get you out of this,
It's a tough bunch of men here.
They're ahnt of? from the world, and
they make and enforce their own law
They handled two men already both
grub thieves. One they hiked from
camp without an ounce of grub and
no matches. He made about forty
miles and lasted, a couple of days be
fore he froze stiff. Two weeks ago
they hiked the second man. They gave
him his choice—no grub or ten lashes
for each day's ration. He stood for
forty lashes before he fainted. And
now they've got you. and every last
one is convinced you killed Kinade.
You see. things have been pretty mo
notonous They haven't located any
thing big. Scurvy is beginning to
show up among them, too, and they're
just ripe for excitement."
"And it looks like I'll furnish it."
was Smoke's comment. "Say, -Breck,
how did you ever fall in with such a
God forsaken bunch?"
'1 c:!i:ie up here by way of the Stew
art, hunting for Two Cabins. They'd
beaten me to it, so I've been higher
up the Stewart. Just got back yester
day out of grub."
"Hold on." Smoke interrupted. "Wait
a minute. Let me think."
He was very tauch aware of the
snores of the sleepers as he pursued
the idea that had flashed into his inind.
"Say. Breck. have they opened up
the meal packs my dogs carried?" he
asked.
"A couple. They put them in Hard
lag's cache."
"Did they find anything?*'
"Meat."
"Good. You've got to get into the
brown canvas pack that's patched with
moose hide. You'll find a few pounds
of lumpy gold. You've never seeD
gold like it in the country, nor has any
body else. Here's what you've got to
do. Listeu."
»***»*•
"My mind's made up right now.
There ain't no doubt but what he kill
ed Kinade. • We beard the whole thing
last night What's the good of goin'
over it again? 1 vote guilty."
In such fashion Smoke's trial began
The speaker, a loose jointed, hard rock
man from Colorado, manifested irrita
tion and disgust when Harding set his
suggestion aside, demanded the pro
ceedings should be regular and nomi
nated one Shank Wilson for judge and
chairman of the meeting. The popu
lation of Two Cabins constituted the
jury, though, after some discussion,
the woman. Lucy, was denied the right
to vo|e on Smoke's guilt or innocence.
While this was going on Smoke,
hummed into a corner on a bunk, over
heard a whispered conversation -be
tween Breck and a miner.
ii .'i / jj 111 l J i u V ,: -. l V i t [ ti . l Ii v / l ?!! u . l? v s ^ flour
"You ain't got the dust to pay the
price I'm askin'." was the reply.
"I'll give yon two hundred."
The man shook his head.
"Three hundred. Three fifty."
At four hundred the man nodded and
said. "Come on over to my cabin an'
weigh out the dust."
The two squeezed their way to the
door and slipped out. After a few min
utes Breck returned alone.
Harding was testifying when Smoke
saw the door shoved ofKui slightly and
in the crack appear the face of the
man who had sold the flour He was
grimacing and beckoning emphatically
to some one inside, who arose from
near the stove and started to walk to
ward the door.
"Where are you goin', Sam?" Slmuk
Wilson demanded.
"I'll he back in a jiffy." Sam explain
ed. "1 jes' got to go."
Smoke was permitted to question
the witness, and he was in the middle
of the cross examination of Harding

when from without came the whining
uf dogs in harness and tlie grind and
churn of sled runners. Somebody near
the door peeped out
"It's Sam an' his pnrdner an' a dog
team hell bent down the trail for
Stewart river." the man reported.
Nobody spoke for a long half minute,
but men glanced significantly at one
another, and a general restlessness per
vaded the packed room. Out of the
corner of his eye Smoke caught a
glimpse of Breck. Lucy and her hus
; band whispering together.
j "Come on. yon!" Shank Wilson said

Raising Fenceposts.
The increased demand for fenceposts
has induced some far seeing farmers to
raise them for sale as well as for their
own use. It takes time, of course, to
do this, yet a shorter period than most
persons suppose. A plantation of lo
custs can be brought to fence post size
in live years from seed. The seed are
first scalded with boiling water and
then after soaking overnight are sow
ed mi inch apart in vows two feet
apart. They are subsequently thinned
to stand four inches apart and are
mulched with straw during pile first
year. As they increase in size they are
agaiu thinned until they stand finally
eight feet apart. From time to time as
growth develops they 'are trimmed to
prevent their becoming top heavy, and
at the end of the fifth year ;ln*y are
ready for the market. Each'tree will

localities these will sell for from '_0 to

The Lonely Miner's Phonograph.
What would an Alaska steamer be
without its phonograph in the cabin?
Not a minute is it idle. Even while
the passengers are down below at
meals some lingering hand reach, s out
for the latest record. One of the gov
ernment's corps of engineering experts
who was on board said: "What w add
the miners do without the phonograph?
1 find one in every cabin, no matter
how remote it may be. It has helped
to drive away the loneliness of camp
life in the faroff wilderness and Is
mainly responsible for the marked de
crease of insanity among the miners
so noticeable in recent years " Tho in
strument on the steamer was just thou
melodiously grinding out "Annie Lau

cial. "of the soothing effect of that
beautiful song on a Scotchman im

Weekly.
Commas.
The French do not as a rule employ
inverted commas to indicate a dia
logue. but they employ the dash to in
dicate a change of speakers, which is
just as bad. Certainly many punctua
tion marks are sadly misused or over
used. Dickens flung unnecessary com
mas all over his pages-whole bat
talions of them. Walter Pater also
employed them with extraordinary
prodigality, frequently before the word
"anil" where the conjonction rendered
them superfluous. Pater was also
overfond of the murk of exclamation,
so that when he drops a "Yes" into
his measured style it must needs ap
pear as "Yetf!" But, though the Bible
docs without inverted commas, there
is real art in its punctuation. How ad
mirably it marks the cadence and helps
the drama in that great story of the
prodigal son!—London Tit-Bits.
Wash All Fruit.
Incoming cargoes of fruits should be
closely observed for traces of poison
ous insecticides Growers are not al
ways careful to remove all traces of
sprays before marketing their fruit
Housekeepers can protect themselves
from danger from this source by wash
ing all fruit in several waters before
serving it It would be advisable and
insure greater safety to wash the fruit
before placing it in the storeroom or
ice chest Sprays and powders of suf
ficient strength to kill insects which
feed upon and destroy fruit trees and
fruit would prove fatal to life if par
taken of by human beings.
Necessitarians.
The philosophic term "necessitarians"
is used to denote tiiose persons that
! deny the freedom of will and assert
that in human conduct all volitions
are determined by motives that obey
the law of causation as invariably as
do the forces of nature. Th" word
j "déterministe" was suggested ns a
i substitute by John Stun it Ydi ami has
j been very generally adopted. — New
