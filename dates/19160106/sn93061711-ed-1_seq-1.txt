looking for tho largest attendance
in the history of annual conventions

tion has ever bcon held so far south,
nnd It is believed that tho prospects
of a week or ten days of tho mild
weather, which prevails in Texas
cities during tho winter monthB, will
hnvo tho effect to causo many cattle
men nnd their families who live in
the more northern nnd therefore
coldor states, to tnko ndvnntngc of the

the rnilronds for tho occasion to visit

inently in newspaper dispatches for

the stories of tho battles being fought
)y tho foreign sections of tho big
southern republic.
El Paso cattlemen arc preparing
nn clnborato program for tho enter
tainment of their visitors during tno

banquets, balls, afternoons at tho
Juarez races, bull fights, automoblto
rides, military drills nt Fort Bliss,

AN UNKNOWN MAN
KILLED BY ENGINE
A man was killed Sunday night
near the Canadian river in Union
county on the Tucumcnri Dawson rail
road. His body, horribly mnnglca,
was brought to this city, but nothing
wna found on his person which would
assist his relatives in identifying him.
We understnnd the engine, which
runs light down to Canadian to as-
sist trains up the heavy grade to
Tucumcnri, ran over the mnn. No
ono seems to know how he came to
bo on the track. His head wns cut
and mashed to n pulp; his legs wero
cut and mangled, nnd his loft nrm
cut into three pieces.
Tho Union county authorities were
notified but no word wns received In
answer to tho inquiry, so the body
was buried Tuesday morning as it
was imposslblo to keep It nny longer
unless funds were received to pay
tho expenses.
Tho man hnd nothing oi value in
his pockets, not even n letter or card
nnd unless he had been robbed and
nlnced on tho track nftor being knock
ed In the head, ho was evidently n

OUTLAWRY IN ROY
Another instnnco of outlawry oc
curred in Roy Thursdny night when
tho windows and doors of tho post
offics wero broken In.
Apparently the net wns committed
by a bunch of drunken rowdies who
had been mnking night hideous.
It is not difficult to construe this
act ns n demonstration of contempt
by tho lawless element for the efforts
of tho better element to ndopt menns
to Insure Inw and order in future.
Tho mntter was reported to tho
Postofllco department and to tho of
IWcH nnd nn tnvcsticntlon is being
made to try to locato tho perpetra
tors.
This is another proof that wo aro
gotting closo to tho point where ef
fective mcnnB must bo adopted to

protection from tho Institutions of
tho law it is going to bo necessary
to meet it with force.

SAYS HEALTH OF
SCHOOLS
GOOD
REPORTS CONCERNING CLOSING
SCHOOLS ON ACCOUNT OF
CONTAGION IS WITHOUT
ANY FOUNDATION
WHATEVER
Having heard considerable about
tho health of tho city and that tho
city schools would probably have to
be closed on account of samo wo ask
ed Supt. Shadwlck about tho outlook
and he informs us that tho health of
tho city as fur as tho schools arc
concorned, is ns good as could bo ex
pected. Only two or three cases of
scnrlet fever are known of nnd these
were not contracted nt school but
during tho recent vacation. Only
one case of diphtheria has been re
ported to him nnd that is in a Mexican
homo across tho track.
Tho schools will continue until It
is shown there uro a number of con
tngious diseases deemed sufficient to
mnkc it nccessnry to tho health and
safety of tho children. Every pre
caution is being taken to prevent an
outbrcnk of nny disease and the Su
nerintendent and teachers nre on tho
lookout for nny symptoms of scarlet
fever, smallpox or diphtheria.
Mr. Shadwick says it is perfectly
safe for the parents to send their
children nt present nnd always has
been because they hnvo never had
a disease break out in the school this
term, which wns of tho contagious
kind. Mnny wild rumors hnvo been
nflont down town but they nro not
true uccording to Mr. Shadwick.
Wo nro certainly glnd to report
tho schools progressing nicely under
his management and know it will
not be his fnult if some contagious
disease is nllowcd to get started in
tho schools.
