CONGRESSMAN WILL E. HUMPHREY
of Seattle would be a lot happier these
days if the United States were in the throes
of a fearful panic. There are some people
like that—croakers, who are never happy
unless others suffer.
Humphrey made a speech in congress
yesterday. He said: (1) We have no pros
perity. (2) We are not going to have pros
perity unless the democrats are kicked out
of office. (3) Even if we have prosperity,
it won't last.
"Why should not the farmer be pros
perous?" Humphrey shouted. "Of course he
is. Crops have been the biggest on record,
and the United States farmer has been feed
ing the greatest armies in the world."
But don't give the democrats credit for
this prosperity, Humphrey warns you. Be
sides, this prosperity won't last, he says. If
the democrats stay in office and Wilson re
mains on the job, WE'LL BE IN A WORSE
PANIC AFTER THE WAR, he predicts.
