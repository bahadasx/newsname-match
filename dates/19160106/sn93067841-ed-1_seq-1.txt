TO BE TRIED AFTER TEN YEARS.
Joe Grant to Face Jury in Edgefioia
on Charae oi Murder.
Joe Grant, a negro, who lost his
fight against extradition from the
State of Pennsylvania, will probably 1
be placed on trial for his life in the
Edgefield county court at the next j
term. Grant is charged with killing j i
J T Durst, a merchant, at Johnston J
early in 1906. The negro is held in '
the State penitentiary and it is said
will not be taken to Edgefield until !
the time of his trial. J
The fight for the extradition of! i
i Grant was waged through a period | \
of two years by Thomas H Peeples, j
Attorney General, and George Bell ;
Timmerman, Solicitor of the Elev- !
enth judicial circuit. The negro 1
carried his case to the United States
supreme court and lost. I
Mr Durst was shot by Grant, it is
alleged, while he was assisting an
officer to arrest the negro. Grant
fled immediately and, it is said, went
to Savannah and from there to Philadelphia,
where he opened a barber
shop. Grant had operated a barber
shop at Johnston.
"The finding of Grant was purely
a piece of good luck," an official said
yesterday. "He was operating a
barber shop and club room for negroes
in Philadelphia. One night
he took too much whiskey and be- '
gan to brag about having killed a
white man down near Augusta. A
* * ? ? a. I
negro detective neara tne staie-1
ments. He wrote to the chief of |
police of Augusta. The chief there
happened to remember'that a negro
by the name of Grant, a barber,who
formerly resided in Augusta, had
several years before killed a merchant
at Johnston."
Following these disclosures, Grant j
was arrested and he then began his
fight against being brought back to
this State. The general plea was .
that he would be lynched if brought
back. The courts ignored this plea.!

Snake Kills Eight Hogs.
Georgetown, Ky, January 1:? |?
James W Palmer shipped a load of ,
: fat hogs from here to the Cincinnati
market, and when the car was un-;,
loaded it was found that eight head
of the hogs were dead. Upon ex-:
amination of the car a large copp .
head snake was found lying dead
the fioor.
When Mr Palmer loaded the c.
here it contained a lot of old bed*
*? n 1 .4 ;w
ding, ana lur raimer put m nc^:.
bedding without removing what was!
already in the ear, and the snake j
was evidently coiled up in the old'j
bedding when the car was loaded.
The hogs must have stirred the
reptile from its hiding place and I
then it was a battle royal for pos- <
session, resulting in the snake killing
eight head of the porkers before
being conquered.
Pellagra Mortality Heavy inS.C.
Twelve and seven-tenths per cent 1
of the total number of deaths from
i
pellagra in South Carolina during
the first ten months of this year have j
occurred in Charleston county, according
to the report filed by the :
bureau of vital statistics with the j
executive committee of the State ,
board of health. ! i
In the State there were 1,306
deaths from pellagra, giving an an- 1
nual death rate of 81.2, or nearly (
equaling the rate for tuberculosis,;
and more than three times the mor-' i
tality for typhoid fever. The rate ; i
for Charleston county alone, where,

Idaho and Arkansas,
In Colorado district attorneys at a
recent meeting agreed that technically
the constitutional prohibition!
amendment and the enforcing statjte
do not become effective until i
midnight January 1, but it was also i
decided that the expiration of all;,

will render liquor sales New Year's;;

authority between $2,000,000 and :!
$3,000,Odd have been expended for !!
drink in Colorado in the last week. j
Arkansas will have its tirst expe- ;
rience with prohibition when the j
State-wide law passed by the last ]
Legislature goes into effect. The |
Arkansas department of the Anti-,;
saloon league has announced that j
the league will have busy workers in
the field to see that the law is en- 1
forced. Anti-prohibition leaders |
have announced that no fight will be j
made for the repeal or ine law ai j |

a thorough trial.
In Iowa "bargain day" sales in!
the 502 saloons of the State are in J
progress today preparatory to the

STATE IS NOW "DRY."
Columbia, December 31:?"Good- j
i '
bye, hooze, we're through," sanyr i ]
South Carolinians tonight as the sun \i
went down and the dispensaries |
closed up forever. The remnant of i'
the G M I departed this life official- ,
ly at 5:25 o'clock this afternoon and
South Carolina took her rank <n the J
column of the prohibition States.-j1
There were no tears and no obse-1 \
rues at the end. The knowledge j1
was irate-wide that the dispensaries 1
,i
or.ld be no more after tonight and
r' ending had been discounted.
With some stock left on hand in
.'(. bland and Charleston and possi-j
..l\ a few other counties, there can j J
be nothing done with it unless the j j
* ? i ' J:. . !
General ASsemDiy directs some uis- ,
position to be made.
The stock on hand will be locked j
in central warehouses and left until I;
further directions are given by the j'
law-making powers.
It is estimated by L L Bultman, '
State Dispensary Auditor, that at :
least $125,000 will be on hand when J
the dispensaries close this afternoon. !
This surplus has placed the State j
authorities in a quandary, as the
bill providing for the referendum
election did not provide for the disposal
of any stock that might be left 1
over, and the position of every official
and subordinate of the system
automatically ceases tonight. J
This raises a doubt as to the owner- .
ship of the remaining stock and what
disposition can be made of it, as it

olina. The matter will either have
to be adjusted by the Legislature or J
the courts, it is said. Williamsburg I
and Bamberg counties are the only j1
ones that have completely disposed I
of their stocks. It is estimated that |
the Columbia (ttspensaries will have
a 830,000 surplus stock and Charleston
$50,000 worth of whisky on hand.
Governor Manning states that the 1
prohibition law will be enforced to i
the letter. Representative Liles of 1
Orangeburg at the next session of 1
the Legislature will introduce a bill 1
making the penalty for conviction of 1
