BUYS HARRODSBURG PAPER
Mr. E. O. Walton, formetly of the
I. J. last week purchased the Harrods-
burg Leader from T. Sanders Orr, and
will take charge Monday. There is no
netd to tell what a good newspaper
man Mr. Walton is, but everybody
knows that he is one of the very livest
in the Stntc, nnd he will put new life
in the old paper which in days gone by
was the dominant figure in the news
paper business in Mercer county. The
Leader was formerly the Harrodsburg
Democrat but when Mr. Orr bought it
from Lew Ii. Brown he changed it to a
republican, then a Lull Moose organ
It became a staunch democratic orgen
the minute it became the property of
Mr. Walton, and he will give the ster
ling democracy-of Mercer a paper that
they can be proud of. Interior Journal,

Quite a great deal of interest is being
manifested in the appointment of n
Chief of Police by the city council nnd
the meeting of this august body last
Mondny night found the court room
tilled with interested spectators. Only
two names were presented to the board
for Chief of Police, that of the present
chief, O. Buck, who had served since
last spring and the name of L. E. Her
ron, who served the city in this capac
ity for several years but resigned a rout
nine months ago.
A lengthy petition was read to tho
council signed by friends of Herron
asking that he be appointed and Mr,
Huck made a statement saying that he
had made 93 arrests since his induction
nto office and had discovered about
fifty hydrants in thecity that had never
been reported or any water rent col
lected from. At this point the vote
was taken and resulted in a tie, three
of the council voting for Herron and
three voting for Huck. Those voting
for Herron, were Gregory, Logan and
Goodloe, those for Buck being, Amon,
Cotton and Dalton. Mayor Davidson
refused to untie the deadlock, but
stated, that he would do so next Monday
night. The meeting adjourned to meet
at that time.
The other city officers elected were
practically unanimous and were as
follows; City uttorney, J. E. Robinson,
City clerk, L. N. Miller, Treasurer
General fund, W. F. Champ. Treasurer
water fund, W. S. Hopper, Engineer
at water station. Parker Jenkins.
The new council consists of five of
the old and one new member, Mr. II.
T. Logan, who succeeds Air. Wea
Zanone, who has served in this capacity
for six years and leaves the board with
a clean record and has proven ono of i
the most faithful members, not having

Probably no more sensational athlote
ever played on Yale teams than Thomas
Lee Shevlin. He was un all-round
stur in athletics, being identified,
witli virtually every branch of sport.
However, Ins greatest famo came from
prowess on the gridiron, For four yeura
he was accorded the honor of being
picked for all-American end. Shevlin
played on the Yule team for four sea
sons, beginning with 1902. As u senior
he captained the eleven. During his
career Yale defeated Harvard four
times and Princeton three times.
On the Yule .truck teum Shevlin also
shone us astur, currying a "Y" in each.
He played on the basketball team in
iis freshman yeur. Since the days
when hu wore a "Y" at Yale, Shevlin
had ulwuys stuud ready to come to the '
aid of his ulma mater us football ad
viser and couch. Lust fall he struggled
hard to whin the uggregution into shape
to meet Hurvurd, und the subsequent
overwhelming defeat preyed on his
mind.
After leaving Yale, at the close of
the football season, Mr. Shevlin went
to California to rent Last week he
returned to his home, and the day fal

Four physicians were summoned to at
