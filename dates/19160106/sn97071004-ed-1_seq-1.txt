OREGON AND WASHINGTON BID
FAREWELL TO BOOZE NEW YEAR'S
Seattle, Wash. Seattle, which, un
der the new prohibition law, will be
the largest "dry" city In the world,
outside Russia, welcomed the new year
and bade farewell to alcoholic liquor
with noise and merriment.
New Year's eve always a time of
street carnivals and, even without the
Incentive of the good-bye to drink, the
street crowds would have been enor
mous. Sidewalks on Second avenue,
in the shopping district, were jammed
to the curb until midnight with slowly
moving throngs of hilarious people.
All saloons did a large business ex
cept those which had declined to admit
only old customers to lament the new
order of things. There was no lack of
beer anywhere, but improvident saloon
keepers who hsd sold all their whisky
and other spirituous drinks were un
able to replenish their stocks at the
wholesale houses, and the variety or
beverages in some saloons was limited.
It Is estimated that In the 16 days

Some saloons ran entirely out oi

Spokane, Wash-How great has been
the sale of intoxicating liquors in bpo-
kane, which ended New Year's eve in
the practically complete disappearance
of visible stocks, probably no one will
ever know.
Observers, with some knowledge of
the liquor sales that have been mount
ing to unanticipated totals during the
19 business days since the Supreme
court destroyed the last hope of the
opposition to prohibition, assert that
$600,000 is a moderate estimate of the

Portland Co-operation among all
Interests affected in irrigation enter
prises and government and state guar
antees of Interest on bond issues are
the features on which are centered
the deliberations of the Fifth An
nual Oregon Irrigation congress, in
session here this week The Jones bill,
which proposes to provide for govern
mental underwriting of Irrigation
bonds, will be an active issue. A sen
timent to promote the movement pro
viding for an initiative law to get the
state to make guarantees also was evi
dent. E. G. Hooson. consulting engineer
for the United States reclamation
service, spoke in behalf of a movement
to put irrigation enterprise on a
firmer basis than they have occupied
under the Carey act. More co-opera
tion among state, Federal ana individ
ual interests, and to establish the con
fidence of Eastern investors in irriga
tion enterprises, be said, were prime
necessities. He said Western irrlga-
tlrtn Antarnriafla needed to be DODUlar-
ized In the minds of Western people,
as well aa Eastern investors, tie de
clared be believed few enterprises
henceforth would be developed by pri
vate capital.
"Congress will give aid sooner wnen
it feels that the Western states are co
operating dollar for dollar," he said.
Governor James Withy coraDe apoae
in a similar vein on co-operation and
nrsred the reduction of overhead expen
ses in handling projects.
"The land must be made available
for the man with $500 as much aa for
the man with $5000," he declared.
Th Omo-nn Irrigation congress sub
stantially committed itself to this line
of action in the unanimous demonstra
tions that followed the recommenda
tions of Senator I. N. Day and other
speakers before its second day meet
ing.
r. A. Hunt, of Lower Bridge, said
that a resolution embodying this Idea
had already been prepared and suDmit
ted to the resolutions committee and
will be introduced in the report or the
mmmlttna.
It was Senator Day's address that
crystallized the sentiments that have
haan ATnrpnapd ainca the besrinnini? of
the congress and directed them into a
definitely indicated line of action.
Plainly and unequivocally ne de
clared himself in favor of state guar
antee of irrigation and drainage bonds,
and in favor of the enactment oi a taw
providing for the establishment of a
system of rural credits.
"To secure cheap money for the de
vnlnnment of irrigation and drainage. "
he said, "the security must be ample
and the payment of interest sure.
This can be secured only ny eitner me
nation or the state standing back of
the projects.
"Whv wait action or congressi
Why not unite with the farmer of
Western Oregon and put the state
klr nf thA hnnria? The bonds, to Bret
the United States back of them, must
be good; then why. If the Donas are
good enough for the United States, are
they not good enough for the state?
"When you have brought water to
the land, you must have a man to farm
It, and how is he to get and pay for it?
He cannot pay for discounted bonds,
high interest charge and short-term
payments.
"Before anv progress can be had in
that direction, some system of farm
credit must be adpoted which win ad
mit of his purchasing on long term,
mh naomenta.
"Rural credits are essential to the
success of any irrigation scheme on an
extensive scale.
"Wo havn Eaatern Oremm askins
for aid for drainage, and both wanting
cheap money. we have many men
seeking homes. Why not unite all
these and seek relief through the bal
lot?
"Why not put the state back of
these projects?"
Mr. Dsy agreed with the other
sneakers at the congress that the
Jones bill providing for government
haclcino- of irrigation rjroiecta is an ex
cellent bill and expressed the hope
that it way be passed by congress.
"But if it fails," he cried, "are you
members of this Irrigation Conor ess
going to let even another year elapse
before taking steps to secure me reuei
that the situation demands?
"The thinor to do is to stOD marking
time and get into a united campaign to
carry through the measure which, oy
CONVENE
of Bonds for New
insuring state backing of the projects,
will make possible the development
immedlatelv of the Irrigation and
drainage projects of the state."

lark nf nuhllc avmoathv with the irri
gation movements, and the failure of a
bill embodying much the taeas ad
vanced by Mr. Day to be carried in the
1Mb CsfKWUia aj s va.a.
Mr. tsy replied to this by asserting
that ' publie sentiment has to be edu
cated, and that If the irrigationists let
a single set-back stop them they will
never get what they are alter.
O. C. Leiter, secretary of the reso
intinna rnmmittee of the congress, ad
dressed publicly before the congress,
questions to Mr. Day, v. u. cnapman

He asked Mr. Hinkle if the bill he
had mentioned had been supported by
an active campaign, to wnicn mr.

C. C. Chapman if the Chabmer of Com

joumiLent of the congress the Cham
hr anld indicate the nature of a bill
it wo-jd lend its support and indorse
ment.'
Mr J Oianman. while expressing
doubt that the Chamber would give a

Hop the congress might see fit to
adopt., believed that it would give me
moat careful consideration to any
rM"e proposed and take the posi
tion which seemed best for the State
of Oregon at large.
n aM that ha believed the Cham
ber would not indorse the measure un
til the form of the bills proposed had

O. iJtugaard asserted that he had in
formation from officials of the Cham-
Kor tn the effect that it will probably
support any action taken by the con
gress, but recommended mat tne out

to the Chamber for its indorsement
The responses of Senator Day to m
nnirlAa fmm Mr. Leiter broucht out a
definite outline of procedure whereby
the measures might be passed by the
people of the state or uregon.
Mr. Day urged that a joint commit
tee, composed of representatives from
the Irrigation congress and farmers of
the Willamette valley interested in
drainage, granges and Farmers' un
ions, be organized to prepare a oxaii
of bills providing for the state guaran
tee of bonds and the development of a
system of rural credits.
This committee would also circulate
petitions to put the measure on the
hnllnt and raise, bv soliciting subcrip-
tions, a fund of $6000 to conduct the
campaign in its behalf.
"Will Mr. Day help such a move
ment financially and personally?"
asked Mr. Leiter.
"Whether the measure be adopted
nr not. whether the people pass the
bill or not, I am for this measure,"
replied Mr. Day.
"I am willing to go in, if the move
ment is initiated, and give to the sup
port of the bill all the time and means
l am able, to carry it through, ihe
man vhn wants to take ud a measure
for the benefit of the state until he is
certain of success immediately is of
little use, and I would just as leave
ninneer this bill as anv other that
means the development of Oregon and
the bettering of the conditions oi nv-
n tnr ita piticena. "
The whole attitude of the congress
during the discussion was intensely
enthusiastic and, while the movement

probably as powerfully aa ever, the
disposition or the congress, as a resuu
of the session, appears to be to pro
ceed along the lines of state aid at the
same time, so that if the Jones bill
fails, it still will have a definite and
constructive program to carry forward.
The principal resolutions will prob-

ably be those indorsing me jones oui,
and urging the organization of a cam
paign for the proposed state measure.
The engineering and legal phases of
irrigation development were consid
ered at the morning session, the prin
cipal speakers being Judge Carroll S.
Graves, of Seattle; Attorney General
G. M. Brown, and L. M. Rice, irriga
tion engineer, of Seattle.
O. Laurgaard spoke in the afternoon
on "Is the Irrigation District a Solu
tion of the Problem?" and he also
gave a brief report of the meeting of
the International Irrigation congress
in San Francisco December 2 and 8.

machinery be created for the organiza
tion of a citizen army, volunteers to
beerin with, but based ultimately on
universal military service.
It was learned authoritatively mat
the administration's continental army
nlan is designed to operate with either
the volunteer or the universal service
system.
It is known that the continental
armv Dlan is regarded in its present
form by its framers as a preparatory
measure, paving the way to a decision
bv the neoole at large for or against
universal military service. In deter
mining his plan, Secretary Garrison is
known to have consulted every general
officer of the active army and many
officers of lower rank.
MARY ROBERTS RINEHART
Mary Roberts Rinehart, the only
woman correspondent who got to the
actual fighting front In Europe and
whose writinga on the war are filling
many pages of the magazines, was in
Washington recently In the Interests
of her friends and tribal brothers, the
Blackfeet Indians.
The nnanimona ODinion of the commis
sioned personnel of the army, as well
aa the civil officials of the War depart
ment, is said to be that adequate pre
paredness can be secured oniy on me
basis of universal service. While
Snrretarv Garrison has made no public
declaration of his opinion, Assistant
Secretary BrecKennage, wno irequem
ly has spoken for his chief, has clearly
indicated belief that universal service
is the only fair and democratic solu
tion of the military problem confront
ing the country.
It has been indicated that the mili
tary committees of congress will be
formally advised of mis view at me
coming hearings.

scription bill to be introduced in the
house of commons next wees, giving
the government the necessary power,
should it be found needful, to bring in
single men and preserve Premier As
quith's pledge to married men.
The cabinet meeting, although it
failed to secure agreement of all the
ministers upon the question of the vol
untary system versus conscription, was
of a critical and decisive character and
virtually reached the decision that the
application of force may become neces
sary before all eligible single men are
effectually brought to the colors.
The anti-conscriptionist ministers
offered strong opposition.
