WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. .
America may never protest the slak

rine. High officials today said that
only after a frank admission by Aus
tria that the vessel was destroyed
without warning could the United I
States make a protest.
Such an admission, unless accom
panied by unquestionable evidence
that the attack waa not Juatlfled is
hardly likely. It would meaa a renun
