The writer was-informed after ho
had made inquiriesVthat it might be,
the Pearsite Company at CJay City
would run wires up to Stanton and
give us electric lights if enough houses
desired such lights. We would have
to have enough homes and business
housestak'o lights to pay them to- run
the wires up hero. Any ono interested
in having these lights in their homes
wllldo.wcll to see tho writer. It would
be a fine-thing to have electric lights in
our town and If enough.cncouragcrnent
is given we will tako tho matter' up
with tho Pearsito people
The Stato Boand of Education have
provided, for u sven months school to
be taught this year. A great many
pcoplo do not understand this, and the
Superintendent has asked tho writer to
explain It. Tho apportionment this year
per scholar, is 5.25. This provides for
a seven months, school. Had it reach
ed $V85 there would have been au
'efght'montha school taught. Had it
not reached tho present apportionment
there would hnvo been only a six
months school taught. But with the
present apportionment wo will have
seven month schools this year, for
which we are very thankful, and we
hope the timo will soon come when
there will be a nine month school in
Kentucky.
In tho leply that the writer made to
L F. Martin in his tract against the
Presbyterian Church, it was not meant
as a personal reply to him, but the ar
ticle was written as a general protest
against all preachers who uso such
methods. As the wrltct said in that
article, the world is weary of this fight
ing spirit thnt is to bo found in mnny
places today. Oh, that we might come
together as brothers working to up
build tho Kingdom of Christ here in
our own country, fighting sin that is
so rampant everywhere, and has such
a mighty hold upon the people of our
county. Oh, that our hearts might be
filled so full of lovo and with a burning
passion in our soul to help win Powell
county for Christ, that there might bo
a very sacrtd fellowship with nil of
Gob's people everywhere and a desire
to co-opcrato with each other in fight
ing sin instead of fighting each other.
The world will not believe the lov
ing message that we arc commanded
to preach and teach to ull men every
where if there is nny malice or jealousy
in our hearts toward our fellow man
who is also trying to help win men and
women to Chr'st There is only the
one Church nnd everybody who lives
the Christ-like life nnd is living n life
of service nnd working for God. belongs
to that Church, The Church of God.
Will any one say' that dear old Bro.
Irvine, that sainted man of God who
walkeu over these hills and valleys of
Powell county so many, many long
years, giving Ids life to our people and
telling the sweetest story ever told
wherever he went; and 'lifting loads'
from burdened hearts, giving a word
of cheer here, and brightening a life
the-"- prenrhtrur. the Invuig 'rnete
wherever he wont, with not a t'rpce of
malice or jealousy in his words, but
loved, honored and rovered by all
with whom he came .in contact, and
cherished today with tender memories
by thousands of persons in -Powell
county, will any one say that this man
of God, even though he was a Presby
terian preacher, was nnt-a member of
thut.Church? . The writer only knew
Bro. Irvine a hort time, but those few
times lie was with him are cherished
memories. Every whei e we go we hear
loving words spoken, of this spirited
man. How beautiful Heaven must be
if it is made, up of such men and -iram-en
as this man was. And wherever the
writes goes over tho hills and valleys
of Kentucky, up the hollows, into' the
poorest and tho bust of-homcshc finds
other sainted men and women of God
and they all belong to this grot
Church. Their names arc not all found,
on the church record book of the
Christian Church. Go into nny piiurch
