HOW IN CHARGE
F. N. Frye is now City Marshal Old
Council Passes With Paying of
Monthly Hills.
Last Monday evening at the city
council chambers witnessed the pass
ing of tho old city administration and
the coming in of the new. After
Mayor Smead had gone throush the
regular order of business for the last
time with the old city council, Mayor-elect
S. E. Notsou, with the newly
elected councilmen and the hold-over
officers took up the reins of city gov
ernment and a new administration
was ushered in. The present council
men are W. O. Minor, J. C. Kirk ahd
J. 0. Hagcr, who hold over for two
more years, and E. G. Noble, W. 0.
McCarty and J. F. Vaughn, who were
chosen by the people at the recent
election. The positions of recorder
anil treasurer remain the same, being
filled by J. P. Williams and L. W.
Briggs, respectively.
" F. N. Frye succeeds J. R McCraw
as city marshal and has already taken
up thed uties of that office Mr. Frye
has had much previous experience as
special policeman on various occas
ions and the councilmen are of the
opinion that Mayor Notson has made
a wise appointment. It is possible
that the salary of the marshal will be
reduced, inasmuch as the additional
salary of $10 per month for fire chief
lias been taken from this ofllce. The
salary is now $85. It is understood
that the council will decide on this
matter definitely at their adjourned
session next Monday night.
NATIONAL FOREST
BUSINESS FOR 1915
According to the annual report of
Henry S. Graves, Chief Forester, for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1915,
the national forest receipts for the
year amounted to $2,481,469.35.
This amount, it is stated, was the
result first, of a timber sale business
of $1,175,1 33. The amount contrib
uted by District 6 (Oregon, Washing
ton and Alaska) to this timber busi
ness was approximately $207,000.
The second source of the national for
est receipts was grazing permits
which brought in $1,130,495, to
which sum District 6 contributed
$120,000. The third source of na
tional forest revenue, special use,
brought in $175,840, of which sum
District 6 contributed over $18,000.
Of this latter figure $10,000 was for
water power permits. Thirty-five per
cent of these receipts reverts to the
States in which the national forests
are located.
The report also states that in ad
dition to the timber sold, there was
given away a large amount of ma
terial to settlors free of cost, the val
ue of which approximated $207,000.
The revenue foregone through free
use of grazing lands is estimated to
exceed $120,000. Other miscellan
eous free uses would yield if charged
for, approximately $100,000. These
values, it is pointed out, have never
been entered formally as a credit to
the Forest Service business, yet this
should be considered among the very
definite benefits from national for
ests. The average price of stumpage dis
posed of in commercial sales was $2.
48 per thousand board feet. The in
crease of 1G cents over the price of
1914 was due chiefly to large sales
of western yellow pine in Oregon,
easily logged and of unusual quality.
Broadly speaking, there has been no
increase, so the report says, in the
value of western stumpage during the
past eight years, and hence no ground
for a general advance in the prices
of national forest timber. The tim
ber sold to settlers and farmers at
cost, brought an average of 74 cents
per thousand feet. In District 6 this
class of material brings 50 cents per
thousand board feet and 25 cents per
cord for cordwood.
The receipts for grazing permits
show an increase of $127,091 over
1914, due partly to the Increase in
fees charged for grazing of cattle and
horses, and partly to the increased
number of the former. Improved
methods, too, have increased the car
rying capacity of the range. Perhaps
the most striking feature of the na
tional forest grazing business is the
Increase in the number of livestock
associations cooperating with the
Forest Service. They numbered 22(1
at the end of the fiscal year, an In
crease of 60 over 1914. In District 6,
there are 44 of these associations co
operating with the Service. The For
ester points out that the desire on the
part of the stockmen to be thUB recog
nized by the Forest service empha
sizes their general satisfaction with
the grazing administration, and adds
that this cooperation has been very
beneficial to the Service In working
out many grazing problems.
e CITY OFFIC
HIGH SCHOOL PARAGRAPHS
The next literary program will be
given Friday afternoon, January the
seventh. One of the principle num
bers will be a debate. Hsolved, That
the Monroe Doctrine should be abol
ished as a national policy of the Uni
ted States. This will be the first de
bate gven by ourrecently organized
debating society. At this time two
Sophomores debate against two Sen
iors. Norton Winnard and Earl Gor
don champion the affirmative side of
the question while David Wilson and
Thomas Hughes will defend the neg
ative. The Freshman class seem to be in
a good humor this week and the rea
son is very plain to the upper class
men. Just before Christmas the
three upper classes decided the
Freshmen needed a present. An ap
propriate one was secured and Ken
neth Binns presented it to them. At
the close of a flowery presentation
speech the present was unwrapped
and handed over to the Freshmen. It
was a bottle of milk equipped with
the other necessities a Freshman
needs in using that kind of a bever
age. Last Thursday the Grass Valley
team secured a 14 to 37 victory from
us. Although the game was a hard
contested one from start to finish,
the visitors won by superior team
work.
The next game will be played Sat
urday night. At that time the lone
boys will play here. The turn-out fo
practice has been good this week, so
'.he indications look good for a fast
game. We would like to have a good
crowd out as the team is twenty-five
dollars in debt.
A dark room is being fitted up by
Ihe Biology class. A machine has
been secured, so now the class can see
slides pertaining to the various parts
of biology.
Most of the classes are having their
Pictures taken for the Annual this
week. The pictures are being taken
early this year so as to allow plenty
:f time to get first-class cuts made.
The midyear examinations will be
gin January the eighteenth.
The Wells Entertainers.
The next number on the Lyceum
course will be presented at the high
school auditorium on January 26, by
the Glenn Wells Entertainers.
Subscription Law.
Few readers of newspapers fully
and clearly understand the law gov
erning subscription. Below are the
decisions of the United States Su
preme court upon the subject.
Subscribers who do not give ex
press notice to the contrary are con
sidered as wishing to renew their sub
scription.
If a subscriber orders a discontin
uance of their periodicals, the pub
lisher may continue them until all
dues are paid.
If subscribers continue to take the
periodical from the postoflice to
which it is directed, he is responsible
until he has settled the bill and or
dered the paper discontinued.
If subscribers move to other places
without informing the publisher and
the" papers are sent to the former ad
dress the subscriber is held responsi
ble. The court has held that refusal to
take periodicals from the postoflice,
or removing and leaving them un
called for, is prima facie evidence of
intention to defraud.
If subscribers pay in advance, they
are bound to give notice at the end of
the time If they do not wish to con
tinue taking it, otherwise the publish
er is authorized to send it and the
subscriber will be responsible until
express notice with payment of all
arrearages is made.
Cut this out for future reference.
ALTAR SOCIETY SOCIAL
The card social given by the Altar
Society on last Thursday evening was
crowned with a success beyond even
the most sanguine expectations of Its
promoters. Nearly 100 people were
present, and It is safe to say that
everyone had a very enjoyable eve
ning. The musical program which
preceded the card' playing, was thor
oughly enjoyed, as was evidenced by
the hearty applause given. Mrs. C.
L. Sweek, Mrs. R. J. Vaughn and
Miss Margaret O'Rourke were the
participants in the program. The
honors for the gentleman's prize fell
to John Vaughn and J. L. Wilkins,
and another game was played, with
the result that J. L. won the fine
fountain pen donated by Oscar Borg.
There were three contestants for hon
ors among the ladles, namely Mrs. C.
Vaughn, Miss W. Winnard and Miss
M. Power. A drawing was made, and
Mrs. C. Vaughn received the beautiful
brooch donated by Wm. Haylor.
Thursday evening's social is a happy
augury of more pleasant ones to
come.
CLUB CGI
I TRIP
Representatives of the Heppncr
Commercial Club tfho made an in
vasion into Umatilla county Tuesday,
returned home yesterday afternoon
enthusiastic over the reception which
they received, both at Pilot Rock and
Pendleton.
The trip by these men was a result
of a letter received a short time ago
from the Pilot Rock Commercial Club
asking Heppncr's co-operation in lo
cating the Columbia Highway from
The Dalles to Pendleton by way of
Olex, lone, Lexington, Heppner and
Pilot Rock. The Heppner delegation,
consisting of A. M. Phelps, J. L. Wil
kins, H. W. Vance, Leo Hill, L. K.
Harlan, Glenn Y. Wells and Arthur
R. Crawford met with the Pilot Rock
club on Tuesday afternoon. Judge
Gilliland presided over this meeting.
After a complete discussion of the
roads between lone and Pilot Rock,
it was decided that the best way in
which active work in a permanent
manner cf carrying out the good
roads idea. along this route would be
to appoint committees in the various
towns along the route of the proposed
highway, that they might work to
gether in close unison at all times.
Upon a motion this Idea was carried
out and Chas. J. Miller and J. N. Bur
gess of Pilot Rock and A. M. Phelp'
and J. L. Wilkins acting as a nomiu
ating committee chose the following
men to serve on permanent good
roads committees in the varlow
towns: lone Bert Mason,' J. T
Knappenberg and Vawter Crawford

BIG RABBIT DRIVE .COMMERCIAL GLUB ,
AT EWiNG 3101!: ' VILL ELECT OFFICERS
Arrangements are being made by
the O-W. R. & N. Company to ac
comodate the several hundred people
who will participate in the big rabbit
drive at the Ewing station below
Cecil next Sunday.
Special rates have been made by
the railroad company and the round
trip from Heppner can be made for
$1.40. From Lexington and lone the
roundtrip fare will be $1.00. An ex
tra coach will be placed in service to
take care of the crowd of drivers.
The drive will begin as soon as the
train arrives at Ewing. Farmers in
that vicinity have charge of the ar
rangements. It is reported that rab
bits have become such a pest on low
er Willow creek that they are proving
a serious menace to farmers there. It
has been necessary to build fences of
wir netting around the hay stacks to
prevent total destruction by the rab
bits. Miss Winnifred Winnard returned
to her home in Portland last Sunday
morning after visiting through the
week at the home of Dr. N. E. Win
nard in this city and at the country
home of Frank Winnard.

TTEE MEETS WITH SUCCESS
10 UMATILLA CDUHIY
o'clock the Heppnerites left for Pen
dleton, accompanied by a strong del
egation from Pilot Rock to meet in
the evening with the Pendleton Com
mercial Association.
Pendleton, being the center of
Umatilla county commerce, is con
fronted with the proposition of meet
ing demands from every point in the
county.' At the present time Echo,
Hermiston, Stanfield and Umatilla In
the north are clamoring for better
roads to the county seat. Pilot Rock
Is asking for road improvements from
the metropolis out to the Morrow
county line by the way of Pilot Rock,
Vinson and Nye. Yet when the Mor
row county representatives asked for
the co-operation of the Pendleton
Commrcial Association in building a
graded highway out of Pendleton to
Pilot Rock and on to the county line,
the association was unanimous In
favoring the plan and at once went on
record by appointing a committee to
act in conjunction with other com
mittees already appointed along the
route of this new highway. Pendle
ton business men were surprised
when they learned of the excellent
condition of the Franklin hill road,
for none of them had yet been over
the new grade.
Hog Hollow canyon was the most
liscussed piece of road during the
two meetings and it was plainly
shown that when this piece of road
is worked over, travel from Heppner
to Pendleton will be made compara
tively easy.
It was the unanimous opinion of
those who mentioned the matter that
the Columbia Highway' travel will go
over the road which affords the great
est convenience, whether it be the of
ficial route mapped out by the state
highway commission or not. The
Heppner-Pilot Rock route was the
one chosen by the Blue Trail men re
cently when they came through here
from Pendleton.
The Hepner Commercial Club will
hold their regular meeting on Fri
day, January 14, for the purpose of
electing officers for th gmoceui e
electing officers for the eoming year.
President Notson urges the attend
ance of every business man of Hepp
ner whether he is a member of the
Club or not.
At this meeting some important
matters concerning future; road work
in Morow county will be taken up.
The committe who met with the Pilot
Rock and Pendleton clubs in regard
to the Heppner-Pilot Rock road will
make their report at that time.

Sue O. Sperry, both of Morrow coun
ty. Rev. W. B. Smith officiated. The
Gazette-Times joins with the many
friends of the contracting parties in
wishing them happiness.
Dan Henshaw was in the city from
his home in the Black Horse district
yesterday.
YOUNG FORCER ARRESTED
Lloyd Meyer, a br,y about 18 years
of age, was arrested Tuesday by Mar
shal F. N. Frye and placed in the
county jail on a check forging charge.
It is alelged that young Meyer gave
Ben Yen, a Chinese restaurant man,
a check for $12.50. The check was
made in favcr of Meyer and the name
of W. O. Minor was signed. When
Ben Yen took the check to the First
National Bank, payment was refused.
It is said that the forged name was a
very poor imitation of Mr. Minor's
signature. Meyer has a mother living
in Spray and his father is in Walla
Walla. Just what action the juvenile
court will take in the matter has not
yet been elarned. The young man
has been living in Heppner for the
past six months and has been gaining
a livlihood by doing odd jobs about
town.
The session of the Oregon Irriga
tion Congress held at Portland last
week was one of the best since the
organization of the congress. Mor
row county was represented by Jos.
Hayes, Andy Rood and S. E. Notson.
The congress was unanimous in its
indorsement of the Jones Bill, now
before Congress. This bill provides
for the guaranty of interest on irri
gation district bonds, by the general
government. If the bill should pa38,
it will enable any meritorious project
to finance itself. The congress also
passed a resolution favoring the same
kind of guaranty by the state, The
general government and the state
would be perfectly safe, as the entire
property of the project would be li
able, and everything in the way of
development would add to its value.
r"he money would be spent on the
project, and this would come as near
ly to the "eating of your cake and
still having it" as can be devised. The
plan proposed is to provide in the
bonds enough funds to cover the in
terest the- first four years; four, per
cent would be charged until the end
of forty years; at which time the ad
ditional two per cent would extin
guish the bonds.
After hearing the report upon the
possibilities of irrigation in Morrow
county, one of the government en
gineers said that the land subject to
irrigation in this county, consider
ing amount, quality of soil, climate,
elevation, nearness to market, and
quality of products constitutes the
best proposition in the whole West,
and that it had not received proper
attention.
First Interscholastic Game Saturday.
The first game of basketball in the
Morrow County Interscholastic Lea
gue will be played in Heppner Sat
urday, January 8, at the skating rink.
The teams of lone and Heppner high
schools will be matched for the prin
cipal game of the evening, while
teams representing the senior and
junior girls and the sophomore and
freshman girls of the local high will
play a preliminary game. The biys'
teams are in fine trim and will un
doubtedly offer some good fast bas
ketball. The nominal sum of 25
cents is asked for the two games and
as the local athletic association is in
need of finances it will not be out of
the way for all lovers of good clean
athletics to drop around to the riuk
Saturday evening and give them a
boost. T he first game starts at 7:30
sharp.
S. A. Harris is down from his
mountain home for a few days. Mr.
Harris says it has been quite cold out
that way, the thermometer falling to
8 below zero a few nights ago.
A. 0. H. INSTALL OFFICERS
The installation of the A. O. H. of
ficers for 1916 was the occasion of
one of those gatherings which serve
to drive dull care away, and make life
better and brighter The officers were
installed in the afternoon and in the
evening a merry crowd of Hibernians
and their friends assembled In the
banquet room of the Odd Fellows
building and proceeded to do full jus
tice to the many good things provid
ed by the fair ladies who had charge
of the culinary arrangements. After
the inner man had been satisfied, all
trooped out to the hall and made the
welkin ring with music and song.
Vocal and instrumental solos and rec
itations succeeded in making the
hours pass so quickly that the chair
man, on looking at his watch, could
hardly believe that five hours had
nearly gone by. The crowd realizing
that it was time to make an exit,
with ferver sang "The Star Spangled
Banner, God Save Ireland and A Na
tion Once Again," and then departed,
well satisfied that 1916 had been so
pleasantly begun.
COLLEGE BOYS IE
101 CLASS Si
O. A. C. Glee Club Program Replete
With Honsjs and Slants.
Audience Well Pleased.
Heppner was again put In direct
touch with some real college life last
Saturday evening when the Glee
Club of the Oregan Agricultural Col
lege made its third successful ap
pearance in the city. Alt-hough not
as large as former crowds, the au
dience which filled the High School
auditorium very comfortably was
none the less appreciative and the
college boys left Heppner with the
knowledge of having made good.
The program this year was un
usually interesting, combining the
classic and the popular in such a
manner that the most critical listen
er could find no fault, and the seeker
after popular entertainment certain
ly had no room for complaint. The
concert opened with a selection by
the club, "Twilight is Lovelight,"
Lewis-Rubinstein. The audience was
at once set at ease concerning the rest
of the program for in this opening
number it was plainly evidenced that
the boys had been trained to sing
well. The second number was a solo
by Mr. Stewart Tulley, a young man,
small of stature, but blessed with a
big baritone voice. He was scheduled
to sing "Evening Star," from Tann
hauser, but reserved the right to
change, singing a sorig the title of
which the writer did not ascertain. '
He responded cheerfully to a very
vigorous encore. "On the Road to
Mandalay" was a popular selection
by the O. A. C. quartette. Messrs.
McCollum, Olsen, Tulley and Miller
comprise this very popular branch
of the club, and while not as strong
as the quartet which traveled with
that organization two years ago, they
ran well with the troups of that
nature now on the road. "Undine,"
Cadman, was another offering of the
clnb which pleased immensely and
was responded to with a popular
song. Olaf Jonasen, student direct
or of the club, had a hard time to get
away from the audience after his
song "Mavourneen Roamin." While
his name does not suggest Ireland or
the Irish to any great extent he sings
their songs in a manner genuinely
Irish, He responded to the hearty
encore with another verse of the
song. The closing number of the
first part of the program was "Re
cessional," Dekoven. This number
was of unusual interest to Heppner
people as the obligato was sung by
Victor Orr, formerly of this place and
well known here. Since leaving
Heppner Victor has studied both
voice and piano and in the concert
Saturday evening performed very
creditably in both branches. He has
a very pleasing voice of first tenor
quality and uses it to good advantage.
The second part of tho program
was devoted to funmaking. The first
scene opened with the familiar min
strel setting, Martyn and McCollum
playing "ends" and Victor Orr acting
as interlocutor. The ends pulled off
some good ones and the club sang a
popular melody. Mr. Tulley made a
hit with his reading "And So Did I,"
responding with an encors. J. E. Mc
Collum was exceedingly clever in his
Scotch dialect impersonations. Mar
tyn and Jonasen stirred things up in
a lively manner and threw in one
heaping cup of cheer to stem the
fast waning tide of holiday jollifica
tion. Martyn is a natural comedian ,
and leaves his audience with a de
sire for more. The club was then as
sembled to represent a typical gath
ering of college lads and sang in suc
cession "Hail to Old O. A. C,"
'Down Among the Sheltering Palms"
"The Sweetest Girl in Monterey," O.
A. C. Medley; Finale, "My Honolulu
Maid."
Prof. W. F. Gaskins was unable to
accompany the club this year owing
to an unusual press of business at
the holiday season. The work of the
club however, is exceptionally meri
torious and reflects great credit upon
this capable director.
Patrons Take Notice.
The People's Cash Market is on a
strictly cash basis after the first of
the year. We would kindly ask that
all patrons now owing us please pay
up. By putting our business on a
cash basis, we will be better able to
satisfy the public and do justice to
ourselves. We will then be able to
go out and buy the best stuff that
cash will buy, and you in turn will
be assured of better meat on the casli
basis.
Respectfully,
PEOPLES' CASH MARKET,
Henry Schwarz, Propreitor.
Rev. Van Waters will hold services
in the Episcopal church in this city
next Sunday, January 9, both morn
