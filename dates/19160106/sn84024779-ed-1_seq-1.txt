The city fathers and the Mayor

sides the allowing of the bills and
other matters, the gates for the
railroad crossings were up for
discussion:
The Great Northern officials
that were present to argue their

E. J, Bowen, Ass't Gen. Supt. E.
G. Hoffman, Supt. of Breckenridge
Division, and Mr. Landis, Ass't
Supt. of this division.
In the discussion, Mr. Bowen
stated that gates were practically
impossible for small cities as
Wahpeton, and stated that after
the late accident of Miss Annie
Smith, that he had three men
come up here to count the traffic
crossing the important crossings
during the day, and another three
during the -night, to see if the
traffic was large enough to war
rant the putting in of gates here.
He also stated thaf there had only
been three accidents here in the
last 28 years. He stateed that the
bells announcing the approach of
a train would be put into first
class condition and that all en
gineers would be instructed im
mediately to slow down their
trains while passing through this
city to the maximum speed of 8
miles an hour. This we have no

The City Band will again be in
the field this coming summer, and
again will the citizens of this city
and visitors be delighted by hear
ing them in their regular Satur
day night concerts during the 5
summer montfts, making about
23 concerts in all.
This band was a Saturday night
feature and it added many pleas
ant hours to enjoyment seekers
on Saturday nights the summer
past, and their endeavors were
amply rewarded by the merchants
and business men of this city.
The band was organized in the
late spring and as a number of
the boys were experienced players
it wasn't long before the boys
were in tip top shape. Conductor
or band leader Edward R. Maresh
lias proven himself a very able
instructor in the past and he will
be at the helm again this coming
season.
Mr. Maresh wishes to issue a
statement through the columns of
the Times and it is as follows:
"Winter rehearsals of the Wah
peton Band will begin Sunday,
Jan. 9, 1916 at 2:30 P. M., at the
City Hall. All members or anyone
who cares to get in the band will
please report with instruments on
that day. Rehearsals will take
place every Sunday at 2:30 until
further notice. Everybody invited.
EDW. R. MARESH,
Conductor."

To the Hon. Mayor and City

Wahpeton, N. D.,
Gentlemen:—
As it is no part of my duty, as I
understand it, to make an annual
statement of the business trans
acted by the Police Magistrate,
but as it is my duty to render you
monthly reports, which I have
done, still at the same time I
think you and the citizens of this
City should know in a general way
the amount of business and mo
neys handled by your Police Mag
istrate, without taking up your
time to check up my reports and
books to ascertain the facts. As
you know, my reports and books
are open for inspection at all
times and I am only too glad to
go through them with you, or with
any citizen desiring to do so, at
any time.
During the year just passed
from January 1st, 1915, to Decern
ber 31st, 1915, inclusive, let me
say that I have handled 86 cases
in which this city is interested.
85 of those cases were for viola
tions of the city ordinances and
1 was a state case. In 42 cases,
defendants were sentenced to and
served time in jail, ranging from
1 to 20 days. In 1 case the defend
ant was sentenced to jail but for
good reasons the Court suspended
sentence. In 1 case the warrant

The above is the couplet of pre

generally circulated throughput
the §ast, and which, if it were
qlosely followed in this city would
lie the means of repulsing the ad
vances of the forces of King La
Grippe. He has already conquered
the majority of V^a'hpeton resi
dents and held them in complete
subjection for a period of time
varying from one day to two or
three weeks.
In the present weather condi
tions his highness ihas a most
faithful ally, who has done par
ticularly effective work during
their campaign of the last three
weeks or a montih. Reports of the
capitulation of one or more .citi
zens has become an hourly affair
and there is no perceptive falling
off in the assaults launched again
st mankind.
One of the local physicians, in
speaking of the present siege in
Wahpeton, described the situation
most accurately when, in speak
ing of the spread of the grippe,
he said, "the woods are full of it."
Medical authorities in Chicago
recently said that the following
method is one of the best cures
for la grippe:

The Date of the Citizens Meeting
That Waa to Re Announeed

V1LL BE 1ADE LATER
On Aooount of the Fact Mr. Henry
E.
Ohizek vyho la In St. Paul
Haa Rot Yet Returned
At the regular meeting of the
commercial club last evening it
was decided that the date for the
citizens meeting should be left to
President Oscar Olson to set, and
Mr. Olson states that no date will
be announced until he conHers
with Mr. Henry E. Chizek, who is
now 'in St. Paul.
This citizens meeting concerns
the bringing of the Equity Pack,
ing Plant to Wahpeton. A large
number of the Equity men, around
Wahpeton will no doubt attend
and give the citizens the benefit
of their knowledge concerning this
plant. The bringing of this plant
to Wahpeton can be accomplished
and only can by one way, that
means by the hardest kind of work
and push by ithe Wahpeton peo
ple and the Equity members of
this vicinity and co'unty, and sur
rounding counties.
Wahpeton has every advantage
that a plant °f this kind could de
sire. It has the sewerage system,
and it is large enough to take
care of their needs. We have an
amply supply of water, more tljan
enough in fact to meet their de,.
mauds, all the railroad advant
ages and can get cheap power by
using a great deal of electricity.
In the first place a site along
the river could be secured for
this plant, or otherwise our sew
