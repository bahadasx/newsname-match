War Secretary Appears Before House Military Com
mittee and Asserts Widespread Responsibilities of
TJ. S. Render Capable D efence Against Aggres

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. .
Secretary of war Garrison
laid before the house military
affairs committee today his formal ar
gument in behalf of the administra
tion's army plan which is designed to
give the country a definite military
policy. He proposes the creation of a
mobile force of more than 1,000,000 men
in six years, accumulation of a huge
reserve of ammunition and equipment
and an elaborate extension of the coast
defences, the whole project involving
an increased expense of $600,000,000
and an annual war department budget
thereafter of more than $200,000,000,
as compared with an average of $100,
000,000 for the last few years.
"The Integrity df the nation and its
very existence," the secretary said,
reading from a lengthy statement he
had prepared, "may depend upon what
Is done in this matter at this time.
This great opportunity will be lost un
less a wise, sensible and practical pol
icy Is the result of the consideration
and action of this congress."
Responsibility Is Widespread.
Referring to the far spread military
responsibilities of the nation reaching
into the Insular possessions. China,
Alaska and the Panama canal vzone, Mr.
Garrison added:
We have determined and announced
that the sovereignty of the other re
publics on the hemisphere shall remain
inviolable, and must, therefore, at all
times stand ready to make good our
position in this connection.
Mnst Not Rrirard -Cost.
-TThexe is a. disposition Troon-the parti

Washington, D. C, Jan. 6. The con
troler of the currency today issued a
call to all national banks requiring
them report to him their condition at
the close of business on Friday, Dec. 3L
In today's call the control er goes
further than at any previous time to
learn if money is being loaned by na
tional banks in violation of state usury
laws. He asked for a list of loans by
all banks during 1915 "upon which in
terest was charged or collected, either
In the shape of Interest, discount or
commission, at rates which would
amount to more than the equivalent ot
six percent per annum."
"Banks are cautioned," says the call,
"to prepare this statement with care
and accuracy. If errors or discrepancies
should be discovered which may seem
to make it necessary to verify the re
ports submitted by all banks, the bank
examiners will beg lven Instructions
accordlnely."
Loans to Depositors Only.
The call also asks banks to state
whether it Is their custom to require
borrowers to carry deposits when loans
are granted, how much they are now
loaning to nondepositors, and how much
is loaned and not secured by collateral.
The aggregate of amounts which bor
rowers have refused to pay banks be
cause of alleged usury, is asked, and
also the total payments made by banks
as penalties for usuar. The call asks
for complete information as to the li
abilities, salaries and connections of
officers and directors of banks.

Discusses Enlistment Problem.
"Our Immediate problem, therefore,
seems to be how shall we meet these
requirements?
"The adjutant general reaches the
conclusion that he cannot expect undei
f resent conditions to' recruit more than

would, therefore, seem Impracticable in
the last degree to consider that the
problem can be solved by providing for
a standing army of the size necessary
for this solution."
Increase MllfUa Apportionment.
Turning to the national guard. Mr.
Garrison said:
"AX the present time this force con
sists of approximately 129,960 men and
officers, and it would therefore be
necessary, if it is to be expanded 13
400,000, to add 171,800 men and offi-
cers- .
T, therefore, propose a large audi
tion to the federal aid extended to the
national guard, so that the system
may be operated to its maximum ca
pacity and be available for the federal
purposes specified, in its most effective
condition."

SENATORS FLA?
COURSE OF U. S.
j Declare Government Guilty
of Unneutral Acts in the
Shipping of Supplies
Washington, D- C. Jan. 6. The gov

guilty of unneutral acts through al
lowing the manufacture and exporta

the senators who participated Wednes

affairs of this government.
There was no division of the de
baters along party lines. Senator Jones
of Washington. Republican, denounced
as "unpatriotic" American citizens who
imperiled the nation by taking passage
on belligerent vessels. Senator Works
of California, Republican, asserted that
the government of the United States
was claiming to be neutral when it was
in fact participating In the war through
the sale of munitions.
Senator Lodge, ranking Republican
member of the foreign relations com
mittee, declared that to place an em
bargo on arms now would be worth
more to Germany than a million men
that It would be a "grossly unneutral
act," and would In fact make the
United States the ally of Germany.
Senators CGorman, of New York, and
Hitchcock of Nebraska, both Demo
crats, urged the advisability of an em
bargo on munitions.
Consul Disregarded Advice.
Senator O'Gorman also Informed the
senator that American consul R. N. Mo
Neely, who -lost his -life. on. the British
liner Persia had disregarded tne ad
vice of American consul-general Skin

deaths of Americans on the Lusitania,

Senator A. B. Fairs resolution
calling upon president Wilson
for information upon which he had
based recognition of the Carranza
government in Mexico was adopted
unanimously today. Chairman Stone
of the foreign relations committee,
saw no objection to Its being- adopted,
and moved that it pass.
Senator Fall of New Mexico, led the
Republican attack today on the admin

speech urging the adoption of Ms res
olution. Says Wilson Isnores Congress.
Senator Fall sa.so. that former presi

official commin-.-a;.on froc president
Wilson, he contin-.en. was a messago
April 2. 1914. in vhich the president
said there was no government In Mex

firm the nomination of Henry Prather

Gnardlan for Unmnrdered Americans.
Senator Lodge also urged adoption
of the resolution.
Is our ambassador." he asked, "to
go to Mexico City, where Carranza has
not gone, or will he follow the flitting
camp of the first chief wherever it
goes? Recently, not only in Mexico,
but elsewhere, our government has
adopted a plan of dealing through fur
tive ?.gents of a personal nature.
"I think it probably desirable, how
ever, that we have a recognized am
bassador in Mexico to look after the
Americans who remain unmurdered
there and the fragments of property
that are left, but I think we should
be informed by the president regard
ing the government to Which he is
to be assigned."
