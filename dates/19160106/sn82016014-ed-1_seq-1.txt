ment and checking of these thousands
of accounts from the state schools,
purchase of all supplies will be made
from Topeka. Kvery dollar spent for

s-ai.i I-ee Harrison, secretary to the
state board of administration. "The
new offices will adjoin those of the

nounced for a combination contract
for all paints to be used thia year by
the state institutions. The board of
administration will join with the board
of control and the slate penal board
in the purchase of the year's paint
supply.
"A consolidation of these contracts
will doubtless, result in a bin saving
to the state," Harrison declared. Paint
prices have soared recently, owing to
the advance in oil prices and the state
will seek a low rate through the letting
of a bulk contract.

GALL FOR NATIONAL
BANKS' STATEMENTS
Fxiuting Details as to Usury and
Ixans Arc Ieman(lol by Comp
troller of Currency.
Washington, Jan. 6. The comp
troller of the currency today issued a
call to all national banks requiring
them to report to him their condition
at the close of business on Friday, De
cember 31.
In today's call the comptroller goes
further than at any previous time to
learn if money is being loaned by na
tional banks in violation of state us
ury laws. He asks for a list of loans
by all banks during 1915, "upon which
interest was charged or collected eith
er in the shape of interest discount
or commission at rates which would
amount to more than the equivalent
of 6 per cent per annum."
"Banks are cautioned," says the
call, "to prepare this statement with
care and accuracy. When this report
shall have been received national
bank examiners will be instructed to
verify the reports submitted by some
banks, and if errors or discrepancies
should be discovered which may make
it necessary in order to secure accur
acy to verify the reports submitted by
all banks, the examiners will be given
instructions accordingly."
The call also asks banks to state
whether it is their custom to require
borrowers to carry deposits when
loans are granted, how much they are
now loaning to non-depositors, and
how much is loaned and not secured
by collateral. The aggregate of
amounts which borrowers have refus
ed to pay back because of alleged us
ury, is asked, and also the total pay
ments made by banks as penalties for
usury
The call asks for complete informa
tion as to the connections of officers
and directors of any bank in other
banks or trust companies, their sal
aries, liabilities as payers or endorsers
and guarantors of paper and the
amount of overdraws against them.
T'nder the call of the national comp
troller of the currency today. Kansas
wiil gather exact information as to her
financial condition at the close of the
calendar year of 19 lo. A call for a
statement from the state banks was is
sued last Friday by VY F. Benson.
state bank commissioner. This action
was followed today by a call for a na
tional report for the same date.
Not sine June 1Z has there been a
call from the stale and federal bank
ing departments for the same date. At
that time the combined deposits of
both state and national banks was
$2i6,66,163.7P. or $4 6,2 81,306.71 more
than the combined deposits of June SO,
1914. Calls on national banks for
September 1 5. 1915, showed deposits
of $224. 110, 576.0.
It is believed that the combined re
port for December 31 will break all
records for the state. Hundred? of
thousands of dollars was spent during
tne tax paying and Holiday season,
however, and unle.-? the movement of
crops during November and December
was heavier than reported, there may
be but slight increases in the deposit
records of last September. The record
for June was the high water mark in
bank deposits in Kansas.

Measure Wildest Coercion.
O'Krien of Ireland Depicts Eng

London, Jan. 6. The debate on the
compulsory military service bill which
Premier Asquith placed before the
house of commons yesterday was con
tinued at today's session. Henry E.
Duke, Unionist member from Exeter,
characterized the measure as the wild
est form of coercion ever applied by
any man in any emergency. William
O'Brien, leader of the Independent na
tionalists, opposed the stand taken
yesterday by John Redmond, speak
ing for the nationalists, and gave the
bill his hearty support.
"I would not consent to strike a
j blow at this country, France or Rus

which would wreck this bill."
Mr. O'Brien considered Ireland had
a claim for exemption "because she is
a distinct, althoug hnecessarily allied
nation.'
He wondered what principle of de

ing young men to serve the country in
whatever capacity they might be best
utilized. The most amazing thing to

TO STAY IN TOPEKA
George B. Hetherington Has
Been Appointed Trainmaster.
Former General Manager'sChief
Clerk Starts on Ladder.
Effective immediately George B.
Hetheringrton, for five years chief
clerk to the general manager of the
Rock Island Lines in Topeka, has been
appointed trainmaster of the eastern
Kansas division of the road with head
quarters in this city. The former
trainmaster, J. J. Breheny, goes back
to Herington as trainmaster of the
southern Kansas division and W. S.
Phillips, trainmaster of this district,
will be chief dispatcher.
George B. IJetherington. of Topeka,
made trainmaster by the Rock Is
land here.
The appointment of Hetherlngton Is
of considerable interest to Topeka. In
the first place it gives the city an
operating office of importance, follow
ing the removal or tne general mana
ger's office a week ago. In the sec
ond place it starts on the operating
ladder one or the most popular and
competent railway men in the south
west.
Started as Call Boy.
Mr. Hetherington started railroad
work as a call boy on the Santa B'e in
Emporia in 1886. He was soon out of
the ranks of the boys-with-the-lan-
terns and went to Newton as a clerk in
the office of the division superintend
ent. From there be went to Fort
Madison, Iowa, as chief clerk to J. E.
Hurley, who was assistant superin
tendent. Then he went to Chilli
cothe, thence to Arkansas City, on to
Wichita, and finally returned to Xew
ton as chief clerk to the division su
perintendent.
He then came to Topeka as chief
clerk to C. W. Kouns (now general
manager), who was superintendent of
transportation. Five years ago in Sep
tember Mr. Hetherington left the Im
portant position of car accountant
with the Santa Fe in Topeka and came
to the Rock Island as chief clerk to
rhe general superintendent, headquar
ters in Topeka. Later, under the con
solidation of the offices, he was made
chief clerk to the general manager.
He is a valuable man in the operat
ing department and installed the "red
bail" work on the Rock Island here.
The appointment of Hetherington
will do much although not all, by
any means to smooth out some of
the wrinkles in Topeka's forehead
caused by the Rock Island's recent
move in abolishing the second district
headquarters of the road. The road
could not have appointed a more
popular man with the commercial in
terests of the city.

London, Jan. 6. Invasion of Greece

patches from widely scattered sources
today.
A press dispatch from Saloniki re

TAKTMOBE TIME
Better Than Lighting the Fire with
Kerosene Says Fire Marshal.
j A campaign against the lighting of
; fires with kerosene is being conducted
by L. T. Hussey, state fire marshal, as
a result of numerous recent reports of
conflagrations started in this way, it
was announced today.
Attention is being called to the state
law, which provides that gasoline
: must be delivered to the consumer in
' a red can, in an effort to minimize the
number of fires resulting from gaso
line being mistaken for coal oil.
Mr. Hussey pointed out that the re
port of a Coffey county case just re
ceived in his office is typical of errors
which may result from insufficient
caution. This asserted that gasoline
: was mistaken for water, placed in a
' tea kettle and a fire lighted under it.
' In the resultant fire one woman was
burned to death.
i "Lighting a fire with petroleum of
any sort is never safe." Mr. Hussey
: said. "It is better to take a little more

no damaging aftermath."

HELDUPTIOEWS
J Utilities Commission Deceives
Thousands of Readers.
State Journal Apologizes for
the Errors of Others.
Open deception In the distribution
of news was practiced this week by
the public utilities commission. Both
moves were made by the commission's
legal department with the apparent
approval of the commission.
Late Tuesday evening attorneys for
the commission prepared a suit to
compel the Kansas Natural to fur
nish an adequate supplv of pas. When
the petition was prepared, the office
of the clerk of the supreme court
was closed. So the plan of the com
mission was announced most promi
nently in the administration paper.
When the State Journal inquired if
the commission had adopted the pol
icy of announcing its suits in advance,
the statement was made that the suit
would probably not be filed. Later
assurances were given to the State
Journal that the suit had been aban
doned. At 3:15 fifteen minutes before the
publication of the home edition of the
State Journal no action had been
taken. As soon as the State Journal
: was on the street, the suit was filed.
: Meanwhile, the State Journal had
j been led, through deception of the
commission, to mislead thousands of
(persons who expected through the
i commission a fair and honest state
I ment of facts.
Apologies of the State Journal are
j extended to its readers for the publi
cation of a misleading statement. The
j report, however, came authoritatively
from the utilities commission and the
State Journal was unable to safeguard
I its readers against misleading state
ments from officials whose integrity

FARMS OF U.S.

BILLIONS IN '1 5
Wheat, Corn, Oats, Itye Crops
Broke All Records.
Corn Is King:, Yield Being
Thrice That of Wheat.
WAR ORDERS HIKED PRICES.
Wheat Made Phenomenal Ran
From 93c to $1.67.
Cornering Grain 3Iarket To
Longer Permitted.
BY JOSFPII F. PRITCIIARD.
Chicago, Jan. 6. Farmers of the
United States raised grain and other
products totaling in money value $10,
000,000,000 last year. It was expected
by many in the grain world, as well
as in other commercial and financial
channels, that the banner crops would
result in much lower prices. The
crops of 1915 came upon us with the
grain bins of the world almost entirely
empty and the enormous movement of
wheat and oats to points of distribu
tion have been taken care of by a con
tinuous extraordinary buying power.
It is always the case that when the
man who follows the plow is receiving;
large quantities of ready cash for farm
products, the merchants and. in fact.
all walks of life enjoy more or less
prosperity.
The total wheat crop in 1915 was
1,011.505,000 bushels, showing an in
crease over 1914 of 120.488,000 bush
els. The 1914 crop of wheat was up to
that time the largest ever grown and
the 1915 crop showed wonderful gains.
The crop of corn amounted to
3,054,535,000 bushels, compared with
2.672,804.000 bushels in 1914. The
corn crop was not the largest ever
grown in this country and the fact that
a great deal of it was of poor quality
and has not been moved off the farms
up to the present time, in consequence,
has kept considerable money out of
circulation that otherwise would have
been sent broadcast throughout the
land.
Oats TncreaMHi, Too.
