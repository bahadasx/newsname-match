Negro Wanted For the Alleged Killing t
of White Mao in 1906 Brought 1
Back From Pensylvania. c
8
Columbia, Jan. 2? Joe Grant, the &
from Pennsylvania, was brought to 0
Columbia last night uuder heavy guard 0
Und lodged in the state penitentiary. a
ihe negro arrived at 7:40 on a special a
pesseuger train which was running in 1
the piace of 31, the Augusta Special, s
which was in a wreck yesterday mora- *
ing. Grant was brought from Penn- u
sylvania to Columbia by Sheriff Sweariugen
of Edgefield county. At the sta* '
tion he was met by two guards from *
the state penitentiary aud they a
brought him up to the state house oil
A street car where he was transferred
to another car and taken to the state ^
peuitentiary.
The tight to get the negro Grant back
to this stute has been waged for several
years. He was accused of klil- 11
nig Mr. Minis at Johnston in Edge- c
ueid county in HRKi and tied to Peun- e
syivama. A reward was offered for e
nis capture and he was recognized by 2
a detective while working in a barber 11
shop in Philadelphia. After his ar- v
rest, he interi>osed every legal obstacle 11
possible and fought pxtradiction to
South Carolina. The then governor a
of Pennsylvania, Teuer, honored the ^
requisition papers from the goveuor c
of South Carolina, but an appeal was
tuken to the courts, the case finally
reaching the United States supreme a
court. That tribunal as all others up- 11
t
held the requistiou and then the new
govenor of Pennsylvania suddenly an- v
uounced that he would not honor re
quistion papers. The negro Grant in H
his appeal to the United States su- n
preme court made sensational charges ^
to the effect that he could not get a 0
fair trial iu South Carolina owing to n
race prejudice.
Attorney General Peeples and Solicitor
Timmerman made several trips
to Pennsylvania to get the negro, and
have used every effort to this end.
Govenor Manning book the matter up
actively and in a letter to Govenor
Brumbaugh set forth that Grunt could
get a fair trial in this state and he called
m the Pennsylvania govenor In the
name of juctice to surrender the negro
to the South Carolina authorities.
Nothing was kucwn of the matter
again until Grant was brought here
last night. He was Id the wreck of K
the Augusta Special in Virginia Frlday
night nud his name as well as that
of Sheriff Swearingen of Edgefield
were sent out on press reports as i'
among tne numDer injura. meir in- ?
Juries are said to bav been only allgbt, to
however. 1
Grant w&g very talkative when be- to
lng brought from the union station to S
the penitentiary and mentioned his to
trip and the wreck. He was well to
dressed, wore a neat looking brown
suit, overcoat and hat with black shoes t
which were freshly polished. He were v
gold spectacles and appeared to be In to
good health. He eomplalned of being y
tired from his long trip. t

'I shall be successful in securing the
lassage of this bill and Rs enforcement

ids South Carolina of the evils of the

laws of this and other States

the penalties imposed did not suficiently
