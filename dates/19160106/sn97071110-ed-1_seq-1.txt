BUDGET CUT
REACHES $35,000
PRUNING SHEARS APPLIED FREELY
Publicity Fund Left Out and Road Fund
Cut from $60,000 to $43,000
Grange Committee Present
The pruning book was used freely
and judiciously on Wednesday of list
week by tbe county court and its
budget advisory committee, consisting
of F. E. Knowlea, C. T. Early, L. M.
Blowers, D. McDonald, J. It. Steele
and F. A. Mwe. Mr. Knowlea took
the place of TTW. Sweaney aa chair
man of the budget board. J. F. Candee
was unable to be preseut-
The court room was crowded.between
75 and 100 interested citizens having
been present throughout tha day. Dis
cussions were participated in freely.
The committees from the granges ot
the county were present and expressed
a sentiment of economy. The grange
will, no doubt, win the name of "watch
dag of the treasury." And while some
nf the objects at which they directed
their shaits may arouse unfavorable
criticisms, their general attitude of re
ducing taxation may well be said to find
universal lavor.
The total nf the tentative budget as
published reached a figure of $165.
271.70. After the board had finished
its labors last week the figure was re
duced to the sum of $130,069.90. I hie
amount will be reduced by the um of
approximately 5,200, earnings from
the oitice of the county clerk, Kent
Shoemaker.
Cuta were made in the tentaive bud
get as follows: Salary of fruit inspec
tor $600 to $400; library , $1,750 to 81.
190, the grange demanding, however,
that only the contract sum of $1,003 be
granted; the publicity fund of $700 cut
out altogether; proposed $60 for the
use of sheriff during tax paving rush
cut out altogether; $100 cut off travel
ing expenses of county school superin
tendent; $200 cut from assessor's fund
for ue put j hire; current expenses were
cut by the sum of $400; the sum oi
$800 was cut from the county poor
fund, it having b een pointed out that
thin fund would not have the demands
of that of the past year; school library
cut from $500 to $250. Road fund, cut
from f 60, 000 to $43,000; salaries ot
road supervisors weie cut to the extent
of $500.
Ihe only increase that was made in
the budget was that of $800, the sum
to be uBed in the construction of a fire
proof vault for county records. This
was made on the recommendation oi
citizens and county officers. At the
present time some of the county offi
cials do not have access to the old
vault and it is declared that the pro
posed new addition is badly needed at
the courthouse.
The work of the court and budget
board, so far as expressions have been
made by citizens, has been entirely
satisfactory.
The total tax levy in Hood Rivir
county next year, exclusive of special
school and road taxes, will be 14 3
mills. Tbe sum of 1.1, the high achnol
tuition levy, must be deducted in dis
tricts having high schools. The levy.
according to the budget of last week,
is segregated as follows: General fund,
3.4; state, 2 6 ; school, 7; road, 6.5, and
high school tuition fund, 1.1.
the city tax was placed at II mills,
making the total taxation on city prop
erty for the year 24.2 mills.
The sum of WW has also been added
to the vault fund of $800, and offices
will be constructed at the courthouse
for Judge Stanton and County Engin
eer Kay.
COUNCIL APPROVES
LETTER CAMPAIGN
At the Monday night meeting of the
body the city council passed in approv
al of the Portland Camber of Com
merce letter writing campaign. If any
members of the council happened to De
in Portland yesterday they were given
authority to act as delegates, repre
senting the city, at a meeting called
by the Chamber or Commerce oi tne
metropolis.
The question of maintenance of the
county library received serious discuss
ion among the council members Mon
day evening. Ihe city fathers ex
pressed dissatistacion on tne part oi
tne county to bear a share of the up
keep of the institution in proportion to
that borne by the city. It was shown
that last year the city raised a fund of
$2,272.98 as against the sum of $1,800
by the county. At the close of the
year the balance in the county treasury
for library maintenance was $253,
whereas the city had $756. Therefore
the city during the next year will raise
but $1,200, approximately, for the in
titution. Crandall and Roberts were given
authority to begin an audit of the city's
books in tne near future.
Mayor Dumhle announced that he
would submit a message to the body at
he next meeting, when the three newly
elected members will take their teats.
The finances of the city are in good
condition, -aa was shown by a report,
shoaing that the warranted indebted
ness ot tbe corporation was $3,856.76
less than at tbe same time last year.
PINE GROVE WEIr
COMES NEW YEAR
In spite of sickness and the fact that
many were watching 'the old year out
in Portland and elsewhere, over 200
men, women and chiHren met at the
grange hall December 31, 1915. and had
one of the beat times of their lives.
Everyone in the community was invited
and made to feel at home. After an
hour of making new friends and greet
inr nM nnsa th nrnjrsm hecran.
An address of welcome and good fel
lowship by Kev. G. E. Heineck, repre
senting tbe M. E. church, was heartily
applauded. Then followed a numorous
pantomime from the grange. 1 bis was
indeed so funny that people literally
laughed till they cried.
The rest of tbe program ioiiowi:
Aloha Club: Vocal aolo, Miss Mar
garet Ferrin.
Epwortb League: Reading, Miss
Esther Schmidt.
Sundsy school: Recitations, Orletts
Heineck and Myrtle Jar via.
Boy Scouts: Demonstration by mem
bers. Ladies' Aid: Vocal aolo. Mrs. Alice
Mam.
Sunflower class: Musical pantomime,
20 sunflowers.
Amicus club: Reading, Mrs. Jos.
Vannier.
The last on the program was a drill
by the W. C. T. U.. about 45 women
taking part. Nineteen, dressed all in
white, each with a baprer on which
waa printed the name otdry" state,
ied tbe march through tbe hall to the
stage. They were followed by eight
"black and whites ' representing ihe
eight states to vote on prohibition in
1916. But the climax waa reached
when the "blacks" with raised umbrel
las passed along. These, of course,
represented the very "wet" states.
The Parent-Teacher Association was
disappointed in their number owing to
sickness Ihe bridge club also was
not represented.
After the program all found partners
and led by Mrs. Ham and F. L. David
son, formed in a grand march which
finally led down to the dining room and
lunch.
January 1, 1916, was ushered in by
singing "Onward Christian Soldiers"
and "America."
The hall was beautiflly decorated
with green wreaths and red bells, sig
nificant of ringing the old year out and
the new year in.
Eleven societies were responsible for
this grand time, with Mrs. Mabel Lage
as mistress of ceremonies. L. C. H.
YEAR'S BIRTH SEEN
FROM MT. HOOD TOP
To climb Mount Hood from Cloud
Cap Inn without a guide is a strenuous
and marvelous task, even for Mazamas.
But the hazardous journey was taken
last week by Charles E. Warner and
William Evans, of Portland. The as
cent was begun Thursday from Mount
Hood aLodge, where the men spent
Wednesday night at Homer Rogers'
lodge. They returned Sunday by way
of Government camp.
The men spent New Year a eve on
the very summit of Mount Hood, saw
the New Year's birth from Oregon's
loftiest pinnacle and stayed at tbe sum
mit until sunrise on New Year's day.
Without a guide the climbers took
the hardest route from Cloud Cap Inn
to the summit, passing through two
terrific snow storms, and then running
into a fog in which Mr. Warner lust his
compass after his companion's had been
broken. Ihey lost their bearings and
wandered off the trail to Zig Zug gla
cier, where death beckoned on every
hand, until the fog lifted and the men
regained their bearings and made their
way toward Government Camp.
Perils oi the trip were increased by
the solid coating of ice which was en
countered near the too of the peak.
I he men nad expected only snow and
went equipped with snowshoes and rub
ber boats without spikes. It was nec
essary to cut every step of the way
over this icy field, both in the ascent
and descent, this waa in the steepest
part of the undertaking and on several
occasions one or the other would silp
while cutting a foothold in tbe ice, only
to be saved by the rope attaching him
to hia companion.
Lleven hours were requited to climb
from Cloud Cap Inn to the summit.
The men completed the vertical circuit
of the mountain and arrived at Govern
ment Camp on the south aide whence a
communication was Bent by Mr. War
ner.
GAME ASS'N WOULD
PROTECT BEAR
If plans that have been launched by
the Hood River County Game Protec
tive Association are brought to materi
alization Oregon bear may And protec
tion as game animals. The local game
protective organization proposes to
have a statute drawn that will make it
unlawful to shoot bear except during
certain months of the fall. It is said
that the animals are'very easily killed
in tbe summer months, but that they
are no good for food and the hides are
valueless. Cubs will also be protected
at all seasons.
Tbe Association also has plans under
way for the protection during the win
ter months of the hundreds of China
pheasant in the valley.
At the annual meeting Tuesday even
ing, when the Upper Valley contingent
was fully represented, the following
officers were reelected : D. McDonald,
pres.; H. Garrabrant, vice pres.; Alva
L. Day, sec; A. J. Derby, treas.: Sol.
J. Spear, O. H. Rboadea and J. B.
Hunt, trustees.

LOCAL CREAMERY
IS SUCCESSFUL
SL0W,STEADY GAIN HAS BEEN MADE
Institution Will, According to Plans,
Make Butter for Outside Ship
ment Next Year
The local co-operative creamery, a
little more than a year old, is begin
ning the new year on a solid foundation.
No local institution has ever met with
greater success. During December,
1914, the creamery made enough money
to clear Indebtedness of operating ex
penses of that month and to make up a
deficit of its first monh'a run in Novem
ber. Since that time it has made a
steady gain, churnings of this week
having been the largest in its history.
During the 14 months of its operation
the average monthly sum of $1,200 has
been distributed among orchuidiuts for
butter fat.
Whereas on former years grocers
were sending approximately $50,000
annually out of the county for butter,
this sum is now being kept at home for
local circulation. With a few excep
tions, according to Clarence E. Coffin,
secretary of the board of directors of
the creamery, local grocers are using
the product of the home institution ex
clusively. Through a campaign of pub
licity the creamery has taught people
to call for Hood Hiver butter, and gro
cery clerks declare it is only on rare
instances that one calls for product of
a foreign make.
In addition to furnishing the local
market, tbe'ereamery, an increase cf
butter fat in sight, has planned this
year to sell butter in outside points.
Druing the latter part of the past year
the creamery has had on its books
names of about 150 orchardists, an av
erage of 100 of whom have regularly
furnished cream.
"Each week," says Mr. Coffin, "we
have one or two additional cream cus
tomers." Until the creamery was established
here the live stock industry was a neg
ligible quantity in Hood hiver county.
The number of milch cows has been in
creased by leaps and bounds since the
creamery was put into operation, and
today but few families do not own a
cow or two. The number of swine has
increased in proportion. The opening of
the co-operative institution made possi
be indirectly the livestock show, held
here last September, a revelation not
only to local people, but to the country
at large that the Apple valley could
win fame in general farming.
Several ranchers began the agitaion
for a co-operative creamery as early as
1913. but Bentiment never reached a
point to make possible conclusive action
until Ipril, 1914, following a meeting
of ranchers and business men which
was addressed by Chris Mahre, manag
er of the successful coopeiative cream
ery at Junction City. It may be said
that the local institution was founded
at this meeting.
The creamery opened its doors fn a
new, well equipped building on Novem
ber 10, 1914. The structure, erected
just across Railroad avenue from tbe
local warehouses ci tne Apple urowera
Association, gets refrigeration from the
large plant of the fruit marketing
agency, pipes having been laid to tne
storage room of the creamery. F. W.
Bluhm, who was formerly supenntend
nt of the Lebanon creamery, was se
cured to take charge of the plant. The
efficiency of Mr. Bluhm, who has been
assisted by L. M. Wiedman, as abutter
maker has had much to do with the
success of the institution. The capital
stock of the co-operative concern, of
which $3,000 is paid in, is $5,000. The
officers and members of board of direc
tors are as follows: J. P. Thomsen,
pres.; A. W. Peteis, vice pres.; C. E.
Coffin, cec-treas. ; H. W. Peeler. M. O.
Boe, W. G. ,E. Smith and Carroll M.
Hurlburt.
F. I. CO. WILL DECIDE
ON POWER PLAN
The stockholders of the FarmerB Ir
rigation Co., who will hold their annual
meeting next Saturday, when they will
make a denfiite decision as to continu
ing with the proposed plans of carrying
out the development of 10 000 horse
power on Hood river. 1 lie d itch com
pany has filed on one of the most valu
able power sites on the river. The Pa
cific Power & Light Co., however, it is
said, has purchased all the land adjoin
ing the point, and in case the irrisgting
concern falls down in its development
of the power site, it will pass to the
big power company.
If the filings are made secure, it will
be necessary to begin imme lately
heavy development work. Some of the
stockholders, it is said, are strongly
opposed to the proposed expenditure of
money on improvements, while oiners
are as strongly set for the develop
ment. Ssturday'a meeting bids fair to
be one characterized by warm discus
sion.
SHOPPING TRAINS
PUT INTO SERVICE
The Mount Hood Railway Co. has
changed its schedule and will operate
twice monthly an early morning train
from the Upper Valley center, in order
to accommodate families of that dist
rict, who desire (o shop in Hood River,
but who do not wish to spend the night
here. One of the shopping trains was
operated yesterday, and another will
be run on January 19. the trains
leave Parkdttle at 8.30 a. m., and on
the retrun trip from this city, leave at
3 p. ro.
Tbe change was made on a recom
mendation of the Parkdale grange.
Ashley Wilson, superintendent of the
valley road, is planning on excursions
to the Upper Valley district, in order
that local people may have an oppor
tunity to participate in sports of the
open snowflelds of the community.
On days of the special trains tne hour
of the local departuie of the first train
has been changed to 7 a. m.
