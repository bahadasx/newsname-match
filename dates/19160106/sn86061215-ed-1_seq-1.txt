Bill to Enforce Enlistment
in the Army Presented
in House of Commons
RUSSIAN ATTACKS

Allies Assert They Do Not

in Northern Greece
London, Jan. 4 (Delayed) A
news agency dispatch from Petro
grad says Austro-German forces
have evacuated Czernowltz, which
had become untenable because of
the Russian capture of the heights
surrounding the city. Czernowltz
la undoubtedly a valuable vantage
point for a Russian campaign. It
already has changed hands four
times. The Russians claim a great
number of prisoners, including
many Germans.
London, Jan. 5.—Under the
terms of the compulsory military
service bill, introduced in the
House of commons today, all males
between the ages of 18 and 41
who are bachelors or widowers
without children dependent on
them are liable for military ser
vice.
Ireland is- excluded from the

promises to bring on the sharpest par
liamentary struggle since the war be
gan.
The Earl of Derby's report on his re
cruiting campaign, which began Octo
ber 23 and ended December 11, ex
plains why the cabinet found lt neces
sary to bring forward a measure for
compulsory enlistment of unmarried
men. More than 2,500,000 men in Eng
land, Scotland and Wales enrolled
themselves, but after those engaged in
indispensable industries and medically
unfit have been winnowed out about 1,
100,000 available to bear arms remain.
But there are' 650,000 unmarried men
who failed to come forward, and the
government will now attempt to re
deem Premier Asquith's pledge that
the married men should not be called
out as long as a considerable fraction
of the unmarried men held back.
RUSSIANS GAINING.
London, Jan. 4 (Delayed) While
England is still debating the question
of compulsion the Russians' great con
Bcript armies are making desperate on

In Albania there has been much ap

U. S. ID PLACE TO
INCREASE TRADE
PROBLEMS FACED IN FIGHT FOR
BUSINESSES ARE FINANCE
AND TRAINING.
Washington, IX C., Jan. 5.—How the
United States through the accident of
a world war has moved from its place
as a commercially provincial and sec
ondary power to the rank of first im-1
portance among the great nations of,
world—economically, industrially
and financially—is told in detail in the
first annual report of Dr. Edward E.
Pratt, chief of the foreign and domes
tic commerce bureau of the depart
ment of commerce.
What the country has gained tem
porarily through the fortunes of the
European conflict, says the report, it
can hope to hold in the commercial
struggle that will be resumed at the
conclusion of peace only by the most
far-sighted commercial preparedness.
Two grave problems face development
and maintenance of foreign trade. The
first is declared to be that of finance
and the second that .of training men
for the work.
"The financing of our foreign trade,''
it says, "and in fact by far the larger
part of the financing of the world's
trade, has hitherto been done through
London. During the last hundred
years London has been the world's
chosen to invest here rather than }g
abroad. This also has been true be-
cause of our position as a debtor na-
tor-nation attitude' on the part of our,
financiers.
The publication of the figures finds
a cabinet crisis caused by the compul
sion problem by no means ended. The
cabinet meeting today (Tuesday) will
come to a final decision and may re
sult in other resignations. Ireland,
which was not included in the Derby
plan, also is said to be excluded from
the conscription measure which is to
be introduced in the house of com- „.

TO INVESTIGflTE
"CRIMES" ON SEA
ENGLISH CABINET MEMBER SUG­
GESTS AN IMPARTIAL TRI­
BUNAL'S VERDICT.
London, Jan. 5.—Sinking of the
White Star line Arabic, destruction of
a British submarine by a German
destroyer on the Danish coast, and the
submarine attack on the British steam
er Ruel are the three incidents that
Sir Edward Grey, the. British foreign
secretary, suggests for submission to
some impartial tribunal for investiga
tion, together with the case of the'
Baralong.
The foreign secretary notes in his
reply to Ambassador Page's communi
cation of a memorandum from the
German government complaining of
circumstances alleged to have attend
ed the destruction of a German sub
marine by the British auxiliary cruiser
Baralong, that the three incidents in
the submarine
"It is evident that to single out the
case of the Baralong for particular ex
amination would be the height of
absurdity," says the secretary. "Even
were the allegations on which the Ger
man government rely accepted as they
stand—and his majesty's government
does not so accept them—the charge
against the commander and crew of
the Baralong is negligible compared
with crimes which seem to have been
deliberately commited by German
officers both on land and sea against
combatants and noncombatants."

TIME TO ESCAPE
TALES OF SURVIVORS SHOW
THAT BIG STEAMER WENT
DOWN VERY QUIOKLY.
London, Jan. 4.—(Delayed)—The
survivors of the' Britich steamship
Persia, which was torpedoed in the
Mediterranean last Thursday, reach
ed Alexandria, Egypt, according to the
account sent by Reuter's correspond
ent at that point, all bearing traces
of shook and hardship. Most of them
had badly bruised and bandaged
limbs. One woman is in a hospital
with a broken leg.
The tragedy was enacted so rapidly
that the survivors say they hardly
realized what happened, consequently
they had little to tell. The passen
gers were sitting quietly at luncheon,
everyone In good humor and an at
mosphere of gaiety prevailing. Five
minutes later those who escaped were
in boats or clinging to wreckage and
the luxurious liner was completely
gone.
Liner Lists Quickly.
Luncheon had Just started when
there came a terrific explosion. The
liner trembled violently and a moment
later listed sharply to port. Only
those who left their seats instantly
and those who had not yet come down
to the dining saloon had any chance
to escape. Many seemed paralyzed
with fear and sat as if glued to the
seats. Their indecision was fatal, as
the water poured In and the list In
creased. Some of those who gained
the deck lost their footing and slip
ped immediately Into the sea, while
others were swept away by waves.
It was possible to launch boats only
on one side of the ship and only the
promptest action by officers and crew
enabled them to launch four boats. All
the passengers praise the coolness
and quickness of the crew. There
were no signs of panic. Everyone
made the most of the few remaining
moments.
Woman Escapes Death.
One young woman described her
experience as follows:
"I was Just sitting down at table
when the explosion occurred. I ran
at once to my cabin for a life preserv
er and twice was thrown down In the
passage by the rocking of the ship.
I got to my cabin, snatched a lifebelt
and rushed to the deck. I had the
utmost difficulty In keeping my foot
ing and was again thrown down. As
I reached the deck the liner lurched
heavily and I fell. Although badly
shaken and bruised, I auickly manag
ed to adjust the lifebelt and jumped
into the sea where I was rescued fif
teen minutes later."
Two bank clerks going to Egypt
rushed to the bridge and dived into
the sea, from which they were saved.
Mothers who went In quest of their
children never returned. Only two
children were saved.
The chief officer is said to have
been in his cabin at the time of the
explosion. He rushed to the bridge
and did all that was humanly possible.
He went down with the ship but was
rescued from the water. He thinks
that the captain sank with the ship,
although some passengers said they
saw the captain swimming.
Few Boats Get Clear.
Many of the passengers believe that
in addition to boats In which they
were saved, two other lifeboats got
clear of the sinking steamer. The
chief officer of the Persia, however,
thinks this is improbable and that if
other boats were seen, aB some of the
passengers declare, they were empty
boats which broke loose when the
steamer turned over and went to the
bottom. This view is supported by the
other surviving officers.
The survivors lost everything they
owned and during the thirty hours
they spent In the boats suffered se
verely from the cold. None of them
There was a suf-
flcient supply of water ^nd provisions,
however, as the boats were already
stocked in accordance with marine
regulations. Everything possible is
being done here for the comfort of the
survivors. Charles Grant of Boston,
who so far as known is the only
American now able to tell the story of
the disaster, is a guest on board the
U. S. cruiser Des Moines.
Sixty-three Lascars among the sur
vivors include a fireman and several
stewards. Only one of the steward
esses was saved.

NATIONAL DEFENSE
UP FOR DISCUSSION
Committees on Both Sides
of the House Getting
Expert Testimony
Washington, E. C., Jan. 5.—When
congress met today members of both
houses were ready to settle down to
the real work of the session.
Chief interest seemed to center in
the question of national prepared
ness, although the senate's proceed
ings were expected to be enlivened
by a general republican attack on the
administration's Mexican policy. Sen
ator Fall's resolution calling on Presi
dent Wilson for information as to
what government in Mexico Henry P.
Fletcher, nominated for ambassador
to that republic, is to be accredited
to, was to furnish the basis of the at
tack. The senator had announced his
intention to offer the resolution to
day.
The subject of national defense
came up before both senate and house
naval affairs committee. The senate
committee considered Senator Till
man's bill for the erection of a gov
ernment armor plate plant, while the
house committee heard witnesses In
connection with the'annual naval ap
propriation bill. Rear Admiral Stan
ford, chief of the naval bureau of
yards and docks," was the first to testi
fy in regard to the requirements of
government yards.
In the house the farm loan bill was
up for debate.

FORMER PRESIDENT IS CONDEMN­
ED FOR CHARGES ON MER­
CHANT MARINE BILL.
Washington, D. C., Jan. 6. —Charges
circulated during the last session of
congress that administration officials
acted in the Interest of (foreign busi
ness firms in urging the passage of the
government ship purchase bill, were
held to be baseless, in majority and
minority reports filed today by the
senate committee appointed to investi
gate them. Both reports also found
the shipping Interests blameless of il
legal activity in opposition to the
measure.
The majority denounced Theodore
Roosevelt for failing to appear before
the committee to testify concerning
his published assertion that President
Wilson and Secretary Bryan "had en
deavored in the interest of certain for
eign business firms to secure for the
United States the power to purchase
the interned Bhips of one of the bel
ligerents." The charge, the report
said, has its origin, "in that ungener
ous trait of the human mind whloh
makes lt prone to attribute unworthy
motives to reduobtable rivals and par
ticularly political antagonists."
T. R. Dodges Responsibility.
"The writer," added the report,
"whose eminence was naturally calcu
lated to give weight to his utterance,
finding himself without any basis, even
of a hearsay character, for his slander
ous attack on the highest officer of his
government, simply resorted to a pal
pable sophistry to escape the respon
sibility for the assertion he had made."
While the committee found no evi
dence to indicate that the president or
secretary harbored any purpose to buy
Interned ships, the majority held that
it was not difficult to conceive of
reasons consistent with the most ex
alted motives that might induce the
president to refrain from a publio
declaration that belligerents' ships
would not be bought. "Such an action,"
said the report, "would rightly be con
strued as an abandonment of our
rights which our nation has vigorously
maintained, to acquire merchantshlps
by bona flde purchase, though a state
of war exists involving the nation un
der whose flag they previously sailed."
Against the Bill.
Senator Sutherland presented the
minority report for himself and Sena
tor Penrose. "We do not concur," it
said, "in sofar as the report defends
the bill itself nor insofar as lt Insists
there would be no impropriety in the
purchase of the belligerents' idle
ships. We believe the bill a thorough
ly bad piece of legislation and are cer
tain that to have purchased the boats
now seeking security in American har
bors would have developed serious
trouble for the United States."
The committee's Investigation was
authorized by a resolution offered by
^Senator Burton and an amendment by
Senator Williams, directing the Inquiry
as to whether the so-called shipping
trust bad maintained a lobby against
the bill.

An avowal of a
policy of nonintervention was advocat
ed as an unavoidable necessity in the
creation of a greater Pan-American
unity by Dr. Luis Alfredo Otero of
Colombia. He Insisted that this was as
imperative as that policy calculated
to prevent the colonization of any of
the western countries by European
governments.
"Foreigners who establish them
selves in the territory of any Ameri
can nation should be unconditional
ly subject to the laws of the country
where they residp," he declared. "The
Instances are many in which the
powers, contrary to the most elemen
tary principles of international law

the sovereignty of Latin-American
states, claiming to place their action

ter of the internal order and on the
little confidence they had in the ad
ministration of justice in these coun
tries.
