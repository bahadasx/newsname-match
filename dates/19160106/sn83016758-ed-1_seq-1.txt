OPEN THE 1916 SEASON.
Co. Basket Ball Team Downs Wells
Memorial Club Quint.
Monsieur Hofflander's rejuvenated
basket ball stars staged the "come
back" act at the armory on the after
noon of New Year's day in a manner
that truly delighted local enthusiasts.
After one of the fastest exhibitions
seen on the armory floor the militia
boys emerged from a contest with the
Wells Memorial club of Minneapolis,
tired but. jubilant, clutching the long
end of a 30 to 22 score. It was a fit
ting start of the 1916 season
The two teams were very evenly
matched, and at the end of the first
round the count was 12 to 12. In rhe
final period, however, the locals dem
onstrated their superiority by nego
tiating nine field baskets to five for
their opponents. Play was clean
throughout, and the- contest was thor
oughly enjoyed by a good-sized audi
ence
Shortly after 3:30 o'clock play com
menced, and from the time the ref
eree's whistle sounded at the outset
until time was called at the end of the
first half there was plenty of action.
Wilkes at center had the jump on his
opponent, and after a minute or two
of play Doane secured the ball, drib
bled it down the floor and tossed it
through the net for the first goai of the
game Shortly thereafter Wilkes ne
gotiated a field goal, and it began to
look like a "cinch" for the locals. The
visitors took a brace at this stage,
however, and made things extremely
interesting for a time. A couple of
field goals tied Tthe.,score,

but Prince
ton forged ahead again, when Captain
Morton negotiated a free throw. An
other field goal by the visitors follow
ed by one by Wilkes tightened things
up again, and thus it alternated
throughout the first half. Before time
was called Doane and Newton gently
tossed the mind-inflated sphere
through the net, and Smith had a free
throw chalked up to his credit. Dur
ing this time, however, the visitors ne
gotiated three goals, and honors were
even at the end of the period.
Confidence marked the bearing of
the militia boys as they trotted onto
the floor for the final half, and their
subsequent performance justified their
appearance. After the first few min
utes of play they forged into the lead
and held it to the end. Smith had his
sights properly adjusted, and during
this round distinguished himself by
throwing four goals from difficult an
gles. Wilkes heaved the ball through
the net twice, as did Newton, and
Doane also made one good. In the
meantime the visitors were not inac
tive, but the clever defense of the lo
cals was not penetrated any too fre
quently, and but five goals were nego
tiated by the down river athletes. The
score for this half was 18 to 10, and
the total count was 30 to 22.
NOTES.
"Pongo"' Olson made his debut as
referee this contest, and needless to
state his decision were absolutely im
partial. Fairness is second nature
with Tom.
Marked improvement was notice
able in the team work of the locals,
and other departments of play. Each
member of the local quint is deserving
of commendation, as they all did ex
cellent work.
Tho boys did not make expenses in
this contest, and they are surely en
titled to a more liberal support from
the public,. Personally they receive
nothing for the time and energy ex
pended, and their efforts to provide
clean and wholesome recreation dur
ing the winter months should be ap
preciated. It is to be hoped that they
will not be forced to discontinue.
Tomorrow, Friday, evening Co.
will again be seen in action when the
powerful Temple team of Minneapolis
clashes with the locals.- This quint
appeared in Princeton twice last sea
son, and both contests were thrillers.
Co. won both, but had only one
point to spare the last time they op
posed each other. Game called-after
the first picture show. Be in attend
ance.

The entire community was schocked
to learn that John Foote, a 'prominent
farmer of Princeton town, had dropped
dead of heart failure Sunday evening
at 10 o'clock. Mr. Foote had been
troubled with a weak heart for some
time, but his sudden taking away was
a distinct surprise to all. He had just
returned from a visit at the home of
his ^brother, Wilson, in Baldwin, and
had" gone upstairs witli the intention
of retiring for the night, when strict
yeserday-!a1Ctei3vomltrs from the
t$&!&$&t^&m&)t sSKko'cloelt iretd fJWW

hour laterand were largely attend
ed. Rev. E. B. Service delivered the
funeral sermon, and the Methodist
quartet rendered several touching se
lections. The Knights of Pythis
lodge, of which deceased was' a
member, had charge of the obsequies.
Interment was in Oak Knoll cemetery.
John Edward Foote was born in the
state of Ohio, August 18, 1871, so at
the time of his death was 44 years, 4
months and 15 days old. While a boy
he accompanied his parents to Minne
sota, and they located on a farm in
Spencer Brook, where he grew to man
hood. Mr. Fooote was united in mar
riage to Miss Adddie L. Hatch in the
spring of 1893, and the following fall
he and his wife moved to Princeton.
As a farmer deceased was particu
larly interested in dairying, and he
was possessed of an exceptionally fine
herd of Jersey cattle. His farm home
is one of the finest in the county, he
having utilized a goodly portion of an
inheritance, which came to him a few
years ago, in extensive improvements
on his premises.
The widow, one daughter,'Iris Hull,
five brothers^ three sisters, and his
mother, Mrs. Alicia A.*Foote, survive
him. The brothers and sisters are:
Wilson A., Sidney S., Alfred N., Mil
ton C, Charles L., Mrs. Lois T. Chap
man, Mrs. Mary F. Peterson, and Miss
Florence L.
John Foote was of an unassuming
disposition, but he numbered his
friends by his acquaintances, and all
regret his untimely demise.
Otis H. Moody.
Another respected pioneer of Isanti
county passed over the great divide
when Otis H. Moody succumbed to
pneumonia after a brief illness, at his
home-in Spencer Brook on New Year's
day.
Funeral services were conducted
from the family residence Monday af
ternoon at 1 o'clock, and a large con
course of friends attended to pay a
last tribute of respect to the departed
one. Rev. C. Larson of Princeton con
ducted the services and interment was
in the Mitchell cemetery.
Otis H. Moody was born in Swans
ville, Maine, April 30, 1849, so at the
time of his demise was 66 years, 8
months and 2 days old. He grew to
manhood in the east, and was there
married..Thirty years ago, accompan
ied by hia family, he came west, and
located on a farm in Bradford, Isanti
county. He resided there three years,
after which he moved to Spencer Brook
which place has since been his home.
Besides the widow, deceased is sur
vived by two sons, Fred and N. J.,
and three daughters, Mrs. A. T. Bax
ter, Mrs. Gilbert Clough and Miss Flor
ence, all of Spencer Brook. Three
brothers, who live in Maine, also sur
vive.
Otis H. Moody was a good citizen, in
the full sense of the term. As a hus
band, father, friend and neighbor he
was all that could be desired, and in
the years to come those who knew him
will never forget the qualities that
earned him the esteem of all who form
ed his acquaintance.
Mrs. Solon B. Heath.
Mrs. Solon B. Heath, an esteemed
resident of this village, answered the
final summons Saturday afternoon, af
ter a lingering illness.

FOB BETTER ROADS
Meeting at Court House Tuesday Well
Attended and a Lively Interest
Manifested by All Present.
Interesting Talks by State Engineer
Mullen and OthersCounty Road
Club Should be Organized.'
Owing to the unpropitious weather
and the poor condition of the roads
there was not as large an attendance
at the road meeting in the court house
hall Tuesday as was expected, yet
there was a goodly crowd present
when the meeting opened. The north
end of the county was well represent
ed, but the business men of Princeton
were conspicuous by their absence.
County Attorney Myron presided.
The main talk was delivered by Mr.
J. H. Mullen, assistant state highway
engineer. He impressed his listeners
favorably and gave some mighty good
advice as well as valuable information
relative to road-construction. Mr.
Mullen laid particular stress on the
necessity for drainage. On clayey
soil he said it was impossible to have
good^ roads unless they were prop
erly drained. A road, he said, should
never be surfaced with gravel or hard
material until the sub base had been
properly solidified. When a road is
graded $he surface should be made
smooth and compact before gravel is
applied. Where a tractor is employed
in grading it answers tine purpose of a
roller. Mr. Mullen dwelt on the im
portance of dragging roads at the
right time. He favored the use of a
planer in preference to a split log or
iron drag. A drag, he said, unless
care was exercised, scooped out the
low places and made them lower, while
a planer filled up the depressions in a
road. A model of the Minnesota road
planer can be seen at the Union of
fice. It is simple of construction ahd
can be built at small cost. Mr. Mul
len explained that owing to the small
ness of the appropriation by the last
legislature the highway commission
^theran church of Princeto was ^ould not furnislLAn engineer for ^^i^^^
county, and that many of the counties
were paying-the cost of an engineer- ^k^gjss
for Jn part of t$e FeaE^A^umberjol^
questions -were ^propounded to~lfit^^
Mullen all of which he answered and $
made clear to the audience.
Mr. Myron then called upon others
to address the meeeting, and among
those who responded were Messrs. E.
L. McMillan, Frank Morneau, H. F.
Mann, Peter Haggberg, J. A. Allen,
County Commissioners Eckdall and
Warren and Henry Marpe. All of the
speakers had something of interest to
say and were heartily favor of road
improvement. Mr. J. A. Allen made
a strong plea for "less digging and
more gravel on the roads."
There seemed to be a sentiment in
favor of tihe county purchasing a
rock-crusher and doubtless the county
commisssioners will give the matter
careful consideration. The following
resolution was adopted with only one
dissenting voice:
Resolved, That it is the sense of this
meeting that the county commission
ers be requested to pay for the services
of a competent engineer or superin
tendent of roads for three months dur
ing the year 1916, provided that the
state highway commission furnishes
an engineer or superintendent for the
other nine months of the year.
While nothing of great importance
in the way of road improvement in the
county may result from the holding of
the meeting, the exchange of views
and Mr. Mullen's interesting talk,
along practical lines-canno help but
be productive of some good. In the
near future another meeting should
be held, at Milaca probably, and a
county good roads club should be or
ganized with the end in view of con
certed action every township of the
county to secure the construction of
more hard-surfaced roads. It is only
by constant agitation and hearty co
operation of the county and town road
authorities and private individuals
especially the owners of automobiles
that the desideratum every one who
is in favor of promoting the best in
terests of the county is aiming for*
BETTER ROADScan be secured.
Patten-McKinney.
Mr. Maurice Patten of Princeton^
town and Miss Ina MeKenney of-Spen
cer Brook were united in marriage Fri
day. The bride is a graduate of the
Cambridge high school, and is a charm- 11
mg and acocmplished young lady, ^T
while the groom is an industrious
young man of sterling worth. That
their wedded life will be one of suc
cess and happiness is the wish of all
whoknowtheseestimableyoung people.
