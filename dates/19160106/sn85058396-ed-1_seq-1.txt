Among the number, the note says, It

CLOTHIERS WANT
GERMAN DYES
National Association Will Ap
peal for Aid in Getting Ship

New York, Jan, 5 The National
Association of Clothiers will appeal to
Secretary of State Lansing 'for assist
ance In an effort to persuade Germany
and Great Britain to allott dyes to be
shipped from Germany to the United
States. The president of the associ
ation was authorized at a meeting of
that body here yesterday, to appoint a
committee to call on Mr. Lansing and,
if advisable, to se.ek the aid of Presi
dent Wilson.
William Corwine, secretary of the
association, said he believed the Unit
ed States manufacturers soon would
receive some consideration. Declar
ing that the present supply of dyes
is enough to last only a few months
he said that if it was not increased
"we probably will have to go back to
the old days when a black suit turned
green in the rain and a silk scarf

ITALIAN LINER
CARRIES GUNS
The Guiseppe Verdi Arrives
With Two Four-inch Naval
Guns Mounted on Stern.
New York, Jan. G. Gunners f the
royal Italian navy were in charge of
tho two guns on the Italian liner Gui
seppe Verdi which arrived here today
from Genoa, Naples and Palermo, the
captain said, daily practice was held
with the guns barrels having been
thrown overboard as targets. The
guns were placed on the Giuseppe
Verdi by order of the Italian naval
authorities, but the captain declares
he was instructed to use them for de
fensive purposes only.
The two gunners became extremely
proficient in tho practice of shooting
at the barrels, passengers said. The
guns were mounted on the after house
of the vessel, one on either side and
were in such position as to command
all positions from the ship.
The captain uescrioea tne guns as
having a caliber of 77 mm., capable
of firing a shell weighing 55 kilos four
and one-half miles.
Port Inspector Reports.
When the Giuseppe Verdi docked
here, F. A. Dowscy, a member of the
port' neutrality squad, inspected the
guns and reported his information to
Dudloy Field Malonc, collector of the
port.
Tlio.Ui aJCft -still ott'tha ahij-and
no action will be taken by local offi
cials until a report of the investiga
tion has been made to Washington.
New York, Jan. 6. The Italian liner
Guiseppe Verdi arrived hero today
from Genoa, Naples and Palermo car
rying two four-inch naval guns mount
ed in the stern. Passengers said they
understood the Italian government had
been responsible for the mounting of
these guns, which were intended to
repel any submarine that might have
attacked the steamship in the Mediter-rnnenn
After leaving Palermo on December
24 all light on the Guiseppe Verdi
were carefully concealed and during
.he day time the steamer covered a
round about course for the purpose of
avoiding hostile submarines.
The guns on the Verdi promise to
bring up again a point which has been
a disputed one since the war began.
At the outset of hostilities the United
States took the position that ships en
tering American ports with guns of
not more than six inches in caliber,
mounted well aft for purposes of de
fense, would not be considered arm
ed, but reserved the right to change
its position in the light of changing
conditions of warfare and the intro
duction of new elements such as the
submarine campaign.
The state department later had in
formal negotiations with Great Brit
ain and France through ambassadors
hero and asked that any guns what
ever be eliminated from any of tho
big passengers coming into American
ports. Foreign governments, it was
expected, and also reserving their
rights, would comply.
State department officials expressed
the view today that the Italian gov
ernment would be asked to dismount
the guns on the Verdi before she sail
ed from the United States.
Liner Must Dismount Guns.
Washington, Jan. G The state de
partment probably will take up with
the Italian government the question
of guns mouuted on the liner Guis
seppe Verdi with a view to having

Instructed Accordingly.
Washington. Jan. 6. The comptrol
ler of the currency today issued 'i
call to all national banks requiring

at the close of business Friday, De
cember 31.
In today's call tho comptroller goes

tional banks in violation of state
usury laws. He asks for a list of
loans by all banks during 1915 "upon
which Interest was charged or col
lected, either in the shape of interest,
discount or commission, at rates which
amount to more than the equivalent
of six per cent per annum."
Banks Are Cautioned.
"Banks are cautioned," says the call,
"to prepare this statement with care
and accuracy. If errors or discrep
ancies should be discovered which
may seem to make it necessary to
verify the reports submitted by all
banks, the bank examiners will be
given instructions accordingly."
Tho call also asks banks to state
whether it is their custom to request
borrowers to carry deposits when
loans are granted, how much thoy are
now loaning to non-depositors and
how much is loaned and not secured
by collateral.
The aggregate of amounts which
borrowers have refused to pay banks
because of alleged usury Is asked, and
also tho total payments made by
banks as penalties for usury. The call
asks for complete information as to
the liabilities, salaries and connections
of officers and directors of banks.

Washington, Jan. 6. Possibility of
the navy being forced by an inade

Island navy yard for the use of big
ships at least was advocated today by
Rear Admiral H. T. Stanford, head
of the bureau and docks, before the
public naval committee. Representa
tive Stevens of California suggested
that congress might appoint a com
mittee to study the desirability ot
finding another location for another
navy yard In San Francisco bay.
Rear Admiral Stanford said that If
it were shown to be impossible to
provide a reliable entrance through
Mare Island strait for the super
dreadnaughts to get to the present
yard, the navy yard probably would
recommend locating facilities for
them at another point on the bay.

As the result of an inspection of
the county rock crusher by Chairman
W. C. Hunter of the county board of
commissioners and County Road Com
missioner Ralph Corlew a decision
was reached to open the plant tomor
row with a force of twenty men.
Ten teams will be put to work next
Monday hauling the material to the
Farr West-Harrisville road, and dur
ing tho week five or ten moro teams
will be put to work. Farmers of the
road districts embraced in the pro
posed improvement will be preferred

being made on the special tax levy
of the year and the appropriation
equal to the special tax made by the
county. The entire amount will be
about $1200. Aside from this amount,
it is said by the county road com
missioner that a state appropriation
of from $15,000 to $20,000 on the
Plain City-Farr AVest-IIarrisvllle roads
which have been designated as state
roads will be expended later.
Other state road districts designat

that the ship was torpedoed same
from one of the officers of the shlpH

the wake of a torpedo. No submarine M

The absence of further definite ad-
