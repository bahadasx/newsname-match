The Right Of Nomina
lion Bill.
Information has been received
here that the "Right of Nomina
tion Bill" will again be introduced
in Congress at the present session.
If this is done every Indian tribe
in the country suould make an
unusually strong effort to have
the bill passed, for only through
it can Indians hope to obtain full
justice.
Every person who really
the welfare of the American
dians in view should not only
no obstacles in the way of
passage of the bill, which provides
that Indian tiibes shall have a
voice in the selection of their
agents and superintendents, but
should support it without loading
it with amendments so that it will
be ineffective. The Indians' Rights
Association, the Society of Ameri-
^jqa^J^diaa*vthe members.~af~ the
Mohonk Conference, the ^ndian
Office at Washington, *n^ theto
General Oouncll of ""Mir.nesota
Chippewa**, all strong organiza
tions with regard to Indian affairs,
should work unitedly for the pas
sage of the bill. But if any of
these organizations fail to do so,
or oppose the bill, they can be
placed in the class opposed to the
progress and welfare of the In
dians.
When the bill was pending in
Congress before there was a strong
lobby working against it which
was organized among some of the
employees of the Indian service,
and especially among tho9e who
were in the field service.
If these employees feared the
consequences of the bill it was not
to their credit, and it was evidence
that their own consciences accused
them of not treatiag Indian inter
ests fairly, nor, perhaps, even
honestly. It may have been, too,
that the civil service law has built
up snch a ring in the Indian ser
vice, and which is the charge of
every tribe in the country, that
the proposed law would have des
troyed it.
It has been stated on good au
thority that Secretary Lane is
cognizant of the large influence
the subordinates of the Indian
office wield in the policies of the
government, ev^n against heads of
administrations, and has not hesi
tated to express himself unfavor
ably regirdmg this condition.
Indian delegations which have
visited Washington during the has
In- lay
the

Wilso? administration have found dians when he saw them on the
street. A pleasant afternoon was
spent with him then, and we al
ways retained the friendship for
him we formed then.
One of the pleasant features of
Mr. Sbevlm's life was the ap-
in Secretary Lane a person who is
unusually fair, and who desires to
correct existing evils in the Indian
office.
If the Right of Nomination Bill
should become a law, the rings
which have been organized under parent pleasure he took by being
the civil service law would at least with his father before the latter's
death. We very frequently met
and the extreme
showed towards

In the course of time the civil each other always impressed their

der it are worse than anything
that ever existed under the old
regime. The country is getting
heartily tired of the manner in
which the civil service law is be
ing conducted by the rings which
is anything but honest.
Let us hope that the Right of
Nomination Bill will become a law
at the present session of Congress,
so that the Indians, the greatest
victims of rings, may at least cast
aside the yoke.

Mean Nominee For

President?
This is a question that no one
can at this time venture to answer
correctly, Justice Hughes, Col.
Roosevelt, Sen. Root, Chas. W.
Fairbanks and a host of others
have been mentioned by the pub
lic press as probable candidates.
it is generally admitted that
President Wilson has kept the
country out of trouble aud war
and this has caused him to be
somewhat popular, but his domes
tic policy, and we mean by this
the policy as conducted by some of
the executive departments of the
government, has been much criti
cised and are extremely unpopu

But even then if Col. Roosevelt
should be nominated by the re
publicans he would probably be
elected as he is popular with the
masses even if some of the repub
lican politicians cannot forgive
him for bis part in the overwhelm
ing defeat of Taft. But the change
of sentiment among republican
leaders which is going on through
out the country presages the nom
in ttion of Col. Roosevelt, and he
will undoubtedly be elected.
Death Of Thomas
Shevlin.
In the death of Thos. L. Shev
lin at Minneapolis last week, a
young man of unusual ability in
the business circles of this state
was removed.
Mr. Shevlin, although he did
not himself accumulate the vast
wealth he had, his close business
associates say his management of
the large business interests his
father, Thos. H. Shevlin, who
died three years ago this month,
left did not suffer nor diminish
any in his hands.

while visiting Chippewa Com

of Leech Lake Chippewas, and the

Death Calls Governor
W, S. Hammond.
Last Thursday Minnesota was
startled by the announcement of jj^e
the sudden death in Louisiana
of Gov. Hammond.
According to telegraphic re
ports Gov. Hammond had up to
just previous to his death been in
the enjoyment of his usual good
health, but an attack of indiges
tion resulted in a stroke of ap
oplexy, and he died almost in
stantly.
Gov. Hammond, before his
election as governor, served sever
al terms in Congress from the
Second district. His home was at
St. James, and he was unmarried.
He was a native of Southboro,
Mass., where he was born and
spent his boyhood days. He came
to Minnesota as a school teacher,
admitted td
the Minnesota bar,, and was pract
icing- law when first elected to
Congress. Had he lived he no
doubt would have been the vice
presidential nominee on the demo
cratic ticket.
White Earth May Have
An Electric Light
Plant.
According to reports it is the
intention of the Indian office to in
stall an electric light plant for the
agency buildings here, and possi
bly this village.
This is not a new proposition,
and at least one or two members
of the Chippewa delegation which
starts for Washington this week
intend to advocate the installment
of an electric light plant at this
village, and would have appealed
to Congress for this even if the
suggestion had not come from the
department.
In order that everyone in this
village may obtain the benefit of
electric lights, an act of Congress
providing for it should not permit
an Indian agent to discriminate in
the same manner Supt. Howard
did against certain residents in
this village when the water works
were built.
In the matter of electric lights
the agency arid village here seem
to be behind Red and Leech lakes
where, it is learued, they have
had electric lights for several
years. Real Help For The In
dians.
The present Commissioner of
Indian Affairs, Cato Sells, of
Texas, has not only taken a keen
and unusual interest in behalf of
improving the social and educa
tional conditions of the Indians,
ing the country's interest to this
work. There has never been a
time when so intelligent and gen
eral an understanding of the real
Indian problem existed among the
ptiblic generally.
Especial attention, therefore, is
likely to be attracted to the an
nouncement that the Indian Ser
vice committee on courses of study
fo the Indian schools ha com
pleted preparation of a scheme
which will give direction to all
this work in future. Its basis is
brighhetherdivision of the school das into
devoted to industrial and the other
half to academic training. The
boys are given practical courses in
farming, gardening, blacksmith
ing, carpentering, dairy manage
ment, saddlery, etc. the girls, in
cooking, sowing, laundering,
gardening, poultry care, and the
Uncle Sam does things of this
sort well, because he provides nec
essary facilities, and knows where
to find experts to use them. If
the precise educational system that
is to be carrieJ to the Indians of
the younger generation, could also
be applied in the rural schools of
the country generally, it would be
one of the most practical services
that the government could render.
There has been endless discussion
of planR for government aid in vo
cational training, but accomplish
ment has been meager. The ex
periment with the Indian schools
should be watched closely by nil1
educators it promises to develop

NOTEThe Society of Ameri

ing in their platform:
"For reasons long evident and
incontrovertible and in harmony
with the policy of land allotments',
we urge the prompt division in
severalty upon the books of the
Nation of all funds held in trust
by the United States for any and
all Indian tribes. We further urge
that these individual accounts be
paid at as early a date a wivdom
will allow. Annuities and doles
foster pauperism and are a curse
to any people that intend to do
velop independence and retain
self respect as men."
An Indian who has no money
coining from the United Statts is
generally industrious and law
abiding." It is tlie Indian who has
money coming from the United
States, who draws a small amount
of it at stated periods or whose
claim is pending before the De
partments and expects to be paid,
who is generally idle, dissolute
and a drunkard. It is ho who
