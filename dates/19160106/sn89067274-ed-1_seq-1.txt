tONE of the most important things
the commerical club to do In start-
the new year is to increase the

it m this city. A few stand-bys pay
Jong regularly, and do the work,

: FRIENDS SAY NOT.
New York, Jan. S. "Friends of
Speaker Champ Clark Sunday dis
cussed the stories recently published
of a proposed coalition between the
Speaker and William J. Bryan to el
bow President Wilson out of the nom
ination at the forthcoming Democratic
National convention,
s -'While Clark has denied the story
from New Orleans, placing himself
definitely and finally on record in
favor of giving Mr. Wilson second
nomination and standing squarely
with him on the preparedness issue,
the Speaker's friends say there is but
one contingency in which the Missour.
ian would accept the . nomination. It
is said: ' ,
'If President Wilson should see fit
to announce formally that he does not
desire another term, and Bryan would
state publicly that he desired to
square his account with Speaker
Clark for having snatched the nom
ination from his hand at Baltimore in
1912, then the Speaker would be pleas
ed to head the Democratic ticket in
1916. This would give the Missourian
the support of President Wilson and
bis friends as well as that of the Neh
raskan and, his following in party
ranks, which is still believed to be con
siderable. . '

Replying thereto t beg to advise
that Sec. 11482 provides that all real
estate taxes which remain unpaid on
the first day of January annually
shall be deemed delinquent at that
t:me. Sec. 11487 K. S. 1909 provides
that all personal taxes remaining un

J 1511 R. S. 1909 provides that the
collector is entitled to a fee of four
per cent on all delinquent taxes, the
rame to be taxed as costs and col'
lected from the party redeeming.
It is therefore our opinion, from
the statutes heretofore referred to,
that the collector is entitled to charge
four per cent on all current taxes col
lected after January 1st, at which
timo said taxes become delinquent,
this four per cent to be collected from
the party paying the tax and is allow.

Very often a person appointed executor dies
before the maker of the will, thereby causing
the annoyance of appointing another. ,
Not infrequently newspapers report the death
of an executor before his work is half com

This cannot happen with the corporate execu

; The following story regard

"He and a friend visited the
slum districts of Topeka, Wich
ita and several of the other
large cities and sought out neg
roes and others who they
thought were likely to be in the
business of bootlegging. . Out of
sixteen tries they, found jonly
one negro who was able to'leaJ
them to an oasis and it happen
ed to be in the negro's pocket.
It consisted of about a half pint
of whisky. Poole and his friend
before they knew that the negro
had whisky, told the black that
they were, awfully dry and he
paid he was willing to accomo
date them by giving them a
dram out of his flask. They
thanked him but declined. The
other fifteen men said they had
no liquor, neither could they tell
them where it could be secured.
; "Mr. Harrison says . that it
was his personal belief that the
