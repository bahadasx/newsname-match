WAGON T HI E V ES
The robbing of farm wagons in the
city has recently been getting quite fre
quent. Not long ago James McKee's
mother had her wagon robbed twice in
one week. While it is careless to al
low goods to remain in a wagon on the
public streets, it ought to be done with- I
, out any chance of loss in a city like
Blackfoot. The wagon thief should In
caught and dealt with as severely as
.possible as a warning that the practice
must stop.
COLORED SCRAPPERS
Ed Watts and Walter Farrell, two
colored would-be pugilists, pulled off a
slugging match in an alley yesterday
but before the knockout blow was
dealt Police Officer Groseclose declared
the bout a draw and brought the scrap
pers before Judge Good who taxed them
$10 each for street privileges. Farrell
paid the fine and Watts promised to
pay.
DIXIE MINSTRELS COMING
A keen interest is felt in local circles
over the coming of the all-colored suc
cess, the Dixie Minstrels, who will ap
pear at the Orpheum one night only,
on January 10th, in one of the best
minstrel entertainments that is on the
road today. This minstrel show is
somewhat different from the average
minstrel troupe, as the company carries
a clever chorus of pretty Creole girls
instead of being all men, as is usually
the ease with other minstrels. The at
traction is one of the funniest and
most novel affairs ever presented and
everything presented is to please and
there is nothing to offend. There will
be two free street parades.

MEETINGS AT M. E. CHURCH
Rev. J. William Terry arrived Satur
day from Warren, Ohio, and preached
his first sermon here Sunday morning.
It was a masterful address on the sub
ject of "Convictions." He clearly dis
tinguished between ' ' convictions ' ' and
"whims." He pointed out great men
of Bible times and in later history who
were great because of their convictions.
He said the great need of the present
is people with such religious convictions
as will make them stand together in
the organized church for the moral and
spiritual uplift of mankind.
If you have not been coming as yet
you certainly are missing some mighty
good things. Below are some sayings
of Bev. Terry which speak for them
selves:
Did it ever occur to you that the
Master said very little about believing
doctrines and a great deal about keep
ing his sayings! *
There is a great difference between
shying prayers and praying. Many folk
say prayers who never pray.
Some people ask God to do things
fo L. th ?, I . n !
, , ,
races and ball games, we have noise at
nolit.io.al meetings—why not at church
cowardly to do those things for them
selves.
God can do for a man what that man
can do for himself—but He won't.
There are those who object to noise
in religion We have noise at horse
I
if there is a genuine religion to back
it up?
If you have paid all your ho
debts, are. on speaking terms with
in business, and have a clean heart and
tongue, and then want to shout, bless
you, go ahead and shout.
closed on Sunday?" You say that is
foolish—but if no one went to church
any more than some of you do, they
woqld have to be.
Some say there is too much love
preached these days. This is not true,
hut there is a great deal of foolishness
preached and called love.
A great many care more about feed
ing the body than the soul, which is
larger than at a church service.
Some people think that a long face
is the. sign of religion, but it is usually
the sign of indigestion. Christians
should be the happiest folk in the
world.
Don't say to young folk, "Prepare
to die." Say to them, "Prepare to
live."
It is not easy to be a Christian, but
it is worth while.
LUTHERAN LADIES ENTERTAINED

Ladies' Aid of the Lutheran church at

The city council held its régulai
meeting Tuesday night when there was
a quorum present.
Mayor Peek called the council to
order, when the minutes of the previous
meeting were read and approved.
Warren Bros. Bitulithic Paving com
pany and the American Concrete Insti
tute were represented by their agents,
who were anxious to furnish the city
with paving material on the best of
guarantees. The former stated that his
paving would cost the city less than
$2.00 per square yard, and the latter
was willing to furnish his concrete for
for $1.35 per square yard. Superinten
dent Harris, of the Montana division of
the Oregon Short Line was present on

Ordinances Nos. 183 and 189 passed
their final reading to become effective

of chaXce, not even excepting churclias
and business houses from pulling twf

exacted.
The licensing of skating rinks and
other profitable pleasures reminded the
e.ouneilman that dance halls should also
bo taxed for the polie, and other pro
tection and privileges they enjoy.
The desire of several residents to
construct buildings of other materials
in the fire limits than brick, stone, iron
and other noil-combustible materials
mentioned in the ordinance, consumed
considerable time, but as the council
could devise no other wav of building
to comply with the fire ordinance, it

QUEEN ANNE METHODIST
EPISCOPAL CHURCH
There is a picture being shown in
this city at this time, at one of the
motion picture theatres that, should bo
seen by every adult in the city. It, is
the picture called "Destiny" or "The
Soul of a Woman." From the artist's
standpoint of view it has been 'well
done. From the religious worker's
standpoint, it is certainly full of les
j sons for everyone. How mud it mad
jfrom his house and she all
mny wrong! How sad I wi
me when a sweet, and tender woman
was deceived by a ruthless man! lion
indignant 1 was to see another man,
who haii taken her for his wife and
promised before God to love her and
to cherish her, drive her and lier babe
innocent of
as to see the
picture of this world, so cold at heart,
(a true picture) making it hard for a
woman to live right, and easy to live
wrong! Hcgr sweet her instinct to save
her boy* to the right path of life, even
though she go astray herself! llow
even clear down to the end of her life
as at different periods in her career,
she comes in contact with him, this
instinct of saving him is ever fore
most! What a moment, when not know
ing who it is, but that only it is a
young man, a representative of Youth,
she declares in the presence of the
throng about her in her own palace of
sin that Youth shall not be led astray
in a place belonging to her! What a
sublime moment when at last, having
found that she has saved her boy*, she
declares to them all that she from that
moment will turn her back on sin; and
goes out literally to become a beggar
of the street rather than continue such
a life!
I do not believe all that the picture
shows me. There are few pictures in
which I do believe all, but here is a
picture that has sermons for young and
old, for rich and for poor and all who
old enough to grasp the argument for it
should see it. I am using many pic
tures here in my church, in illustration
of sermons. The length of this picture
and the fact that I am appealing to
many children are the only reasons that
I should not use the picture in my
church services.

DESTINY'
'Destiny," or the Soul of a Wo
man, ' ' starring Emily Stevens, the
brilliant emotional actress, will be
shown at the Isis theatre on Thursday
and Friday, January 13th and 14th. It
a powerful allegorical study, which
will appeal strongly to every human
heart." It is the latest release on the
program of the Metro Pictures corpora
tion and was produced by* the B. A.
Rolfe company from the original man
uscript by* Anthony Kelley.
Throughout all the pictures 's five
lets it carries a convincing and en
thralling message; the treatment of tlm
theme is most unusual and it is notably
rich in novel and striking photographic,
effects. Some of the most startling of
these occur in the cafe scenes, whither
the young novice goes to view the
world. When Rum, Lust and Avarice
tempt the boy, their shadows are seen
to leave their bodies and go over to
whisper in the lad's ear, while their
bodies remain in their seats. The clos
ing scene, in which the Angel of Death
descends from a painting of the Madon
na and carries off the woman's soul, ii
ft piece of wonderful photography.

JS DENIED
N. M. Holm of Shelley, engineer in
harge of the St. Anthony Power com

with the State Board of Public Utilities
to solve the water problem of the Mud
lake district, and if his plans carry
out, to insure a sufficient amount of
water in that luke to give the North
lake project of some 30,000 acres, in
which he is interested, sufficient water
for irrigation. A great portion of the
water of Mud lake has been appropriat
ed by projects well under way, and
when the promoters of the North lake
project made application for water they
were notified by the state engineer
that there was not enough water in
Mud lake to insure the success of the
new project, and the application of the
company was rejected.—Pocatello Tri
