America Must Prove That
Democracy Is More
Than a Dream
By Miss MARGARET WILSON, Daugh*
ter of President Wilson
LET us make the vote mean some
thing—all of us, men and wo
men together. It is disgrace
ful the way the majority of voters
vote. I am told that when a man
gets a suit he gets what the tailor
tells him to wear. That is what
most voters do in the primaries.
They vote for the man who "they
say" is the man, "they" being in
this case the political bosses.
WE KNOW THIS, BUT HAVE
DONE LITTLE 80 FAR EXCEPT
TALK ABOUT IT.
It surely is America's opportunity
before all other nations to prove
that the ideal of democracy is more
than a dream; that it is a principle
that works. Self government is
nothing more or less than a process
of education.
I REALIZE THAT DEMOCRA
CY CANNOT BE OBTAINED
THROUGH A MACHINE, AND
WE MUST HAVE THE MEANS
OF EXPRESSING OURSELVES
AS CITIZENS IN \ MORE- VI
TAL WAY.

COL MILLER TO TALK
ON LOCAL INTERESTS
Col. Wm. Hamilton Miller wt'l
deliver an addre.-,u Wednesday night
in Jamieson's Opsra House as the
third number of the high school lec
ture course.
Colonel Miller is known through the
West as "the man who delivers the
message of community development
with a smile." And it is more than a
smile, for Colonel Miller is so full of
humor and fun that it just bubbles out
all over him, and his good humor per-
COLONEL MILLER
meates all of his audience, too. For
while he delivers a message to his
hearers that inspires each one, he
serves those thoughts in sugar-coated
doses and you can't help but laugh at
his "sweetened philosophy." Colonel
Miller is to lecture on the lyceura
course and those who do not hear
him will miss one of the best numbers
of the entire course.

POETRY IN LIFE.
The present life Is not wholly
prosaic, precise, tame and Unite
It Is not true that the poet paints
a Ufe which does not exist He
only extracts and concentrates,
as it were, life's ethereal es
sence, arrests and condenses its
volatile fragrance, brings togeth
er Its scattered beauties and
prolongs its more refined but
evanescent Joys. And in this he
does well, for It is good to feel
that life Is not wholly usurped
by cares for subsistence and
physical gratifications, but ad
mits, In measures which may be
Indefinitely enlarged, sentiments
and delights worthy of a higher
belng.-Willlam Ellery Chan

He Likes Lynden's Billboard Law
Dr. Herman A. Braver, secretary
treasurer of the League of Washing
ton Municipalities and Director of
the Bureau of Municipal Research
at the University of Washington,
thinks Lynden acted wisely in mss
ing its billboard ordinance. "I be
lieve that you have probably Bolved
the problem very wisely for a city
o* your size," says Dr. Braver in a
letter received in Lynden this week.
"It may interest you to know that
In the ordinance recently proposed
for the city of Seattle, the fee was
only one cent per square foot, which
01 course would produce on the av
erage considerably less revenue
than your fee of five dollars per
year. But the tendency in cities
taxing billboards at all is to raise
the tax to something like the
amount you provide."
BETTER THINGS.
BETTER to feci a love within
Than to be lonely to the
Bight;
Better a homely tenderness
Than beauty's wild delight
Better to love than to be loved.
Though lonely all the day;
Better the fountain in the heart
Than the fountain by tho way.
Better to be a little wise
Than learned overmuch;
Better than high are lowly thoughts,
For truthful thoughta are «uch.
Better to have a quiet grief
Than a tumultuous joy;
Better than manhood, age's face.
If the heart be of a boy.
Better a death when work Is done
Than earth's most favored birth;
Better a child in God's great house
Than the king of all the earth.
—George Macdonald.
ANCIENT WAR 80NQ.
THE mountain sheep are sweeter.
Hut the valley sheep are fatter;
We therefore deemed It meeter
To carry off the latter.
We made an expedition.
We met a host and quelled It;
We forced a strong position
And killed the men who held It.
\\TE brought away from battle,
»» And much their land bemoaned
them.
Two thousand head of cattle
And the head of him who owned them;
Edynfed, kins of Dyfed,
His head was borne before us;
His wine and beasts supplied our feasts
And his overthrow our chorus.
—Thomas Love Peacock.
