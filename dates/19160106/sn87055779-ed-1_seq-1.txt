To transport their artillery the
Germans were compelled to recon

The first point at which the Ger

DEATH HOUR
Wife Was Banker
So Court Refuses
Her Allowance
Pecause the wife had been the
treasurer of the family, all funds
from the husband had been turned
into her for dispersal. Judge Oeorne
lord Thursday refused to make ?.n
order on Itnre Kopcsandi asked for
ly hi.s wife, Anna Kopcsandl for
temporary allowance and advance
attorney's fees. The wife in the case
is asking for a divorce. j
Judge Ford held tha the wife had !
had plenty of opportunity in the past
to hoard the savings, and inasmuch,,
she had doled out the family
purs? in small allotments, she was
not entitled to support money at the
I resent. A restraining order asking
that the husband be prevented from
collecting his wage and obtaining
any funds which he might have in
the bank, was also overruled, "until
some real danger should arise."
KUESPERT FINDS
MEN HAVE ALIBIS
Back From Oak Park,
Where Two Suspects
Were in Custody.
Chief of Detectives John P. Kues
pert is back in South Pend again to
report the elimination of another
possible clue to the two bandits who
shot and killed Henry Maessel and
Frank Chrobot. Ku-spert has been
in Oak Park, 111., where two gunmen
have been placed under arrest in
connection with a number of rob
beries, hut upon' investigation he
found that neither of the men could
have had anything to do with the
brewery shooting.
Olncials at Oak Park notified
Kuespert that the two gunmen had
been arrested and had in their pos
session automatic guns similar to
those used in killing Muessel and
Chrobot. The South Bend detective
questioned the men thoroughly and
investigated their actions ot the time
the Muessel affair took place, but
the gunmen proved alibis. Doth
have been released by the Oak Park
police upon bonds amounting; to
$15.000 as they are alleged to be
implicated in a number of other
robberies.
Kuespert declared Thursday that
nothing new had developed in cither
the double murder mystery or the
Rogers shooting. Several suspects
are still held while others are under
surveillance, but thus far there is
no tangible evidence against any of
the men.
Regarding the Hogers shooting,
about w hich rumors were circulated,
the police department stated that
these had been investigated thor
oughly and found to be baseless as
far as could be learned. Rogers was
reported to be out of danger and is
expected to return to work as soon
as Iiis wound heals. Several clues
which may lead to the arrest of the
man who phot the policeman are
being investigated.

RON DON, Jan. 6. Py a vote of
four to one, delegates to the Na
tional labor congress today voted
down an amendment supporting a
measure to make it compulsory for
single men of military age to attest
their willingness to enlist.
Relegates representing 2,121,000
union workmen in the United King
dom voted against the amendment,
while delegates representing 341,000
union workers voted for it. The
amendment was introduced in con
nection with a resolution condemn
ing conscription. There are 900 dele
gates present at the labor congress,
representing 4 00 unions with an ap
proximate membership of 3,000,000.
In spite of bitter opposition In the
house of comons against the military
service bill, providing modified con
scription, government leaders de
clared today that its immediate paa-s-
go would be pressed, and predict
ed that it would be on the statute
books by Feb. 2.
Ireland is Excluded.
While Ireland was excluded from
the workings of the measure, the bill
will be opposed by the Irish nation
alists, under leadership of John Red
mond. This will weaken the position
of the government, which has work
ed in coalition with the nationalists
in the past, and there will be further
loss of strength through the antag-
onisi"n of the laborites. Hut the gov
ernment hopes to secure support
from the unionists to make up the
defection.
The solemn warning" of Lord
Kitchener the war secretary, that
Fngland must have conscription or
lose the war. will be used as a pow
erful argument by the supporters of
Premier Asquith.
Sir John Simon, forirer secretary
of state for home affairs, who tired
the opening gun in the tight against
conscription in commons Wednesday,
will be one of the chief leaders
among the anti-conscriptionists.
England's political situation just
now U dark and filled with possibil
ities. One of the possibilities is a'
general election within the next
fortnight with conscription as the
sole issue. The political correspond
ent of the Daily News prophecies
that such an election would probably
sweep the conservatives into power
and that David Lloyd-George, min
ister of munitions. would hold a
commanding position in the cabinet.
Others .May uit.
Although the cabinet outwardly
has the appearance of unity, the
I possibility of further resignations is
far from past. Sir John Simon, whose
resignation was brought about by his
opposition to conscription. openly
declares that there are other min
isters who still share his views. The
b-lief is that he refers to Arthur
Henderson, president of the board
of agriculture; Reginald McKena.

PARKERSBURG, W. Va., Jan. 6.
Fourteen passengers and members
of the crew of the steamer Kanawha
which sank 10 miles beiow here last
night were missing at daybreak this
morning, nearly 12 hours after the
Pittshurgh-Charleston packet struck
a pier at Dam No. 19.
Forty-six persons, including most
of the steamer's crew had been pick
ed up along1 the river shores or res
cued in a row boat by Harold Wright,
watchman at the dam. Wright is
the shining hero of one of the worst
accidents in the history of the river.
He alone is credited with saving a
scoreof lives, making one trip after
another to the sinking boat.
A rescue party under the leader
ship of Capt. William Roe. head of
the Pittsburgh ard Ohio River
Packet Co., which owned the Kan
awha, left here at 7 o'clock to search
both sides of the river for survivors
who may have clung to floating
wreckage and landed on shore safely.
Had Time in Save Sc-Ios.
Capt. Perry of Willlamstown. V.
Va., pilot and commanding officer on
the Kanawha at the time of the ac
cident, said this morning that he be
lieved all on board, mostly men, had
ample time after th collision to
cave themselves and That there wou'd
be no loss of life. It is believed hen.
however, that the swollen waters and
swift current resulting from recent
heavy snow and rain would exact a
toll of at least half of the number
reported missing:
The boat went down in 3S feet of
water at a point where the river, at
its present stage, is a mile wide.
Capt. Perry, w ho was at the wheel,
stayed with the boat until it wen
tinder, tloatinff a mile and a half
downstream.
Signal Light Out.
A heavy wind, which blew out the
signal light on the pier and which
caused the steamer to veer out of
the natural channel is given as the
cause of the collision.
The Kanawha, which recently had
been rebuilt, was valued at $3.",0G0.

NKW YORK, Jan. 6. Noticeably
weak from 10 days of sickness and

to lean heavily on a desk as he spoke,
Robert L,. IJ.itts of Texas, special
assistant to Atty. Gen. Gregory, to
day appeared in court against the
advice of hi.s physician and bitterly
denounced the 11 former directors
of the New Haven railway as the
most llagrant and brazen offenders
he ever prosecuted.
Patts, speaking the government's
last word in the long and tedious
New Haven conspiracy trial expected
to consume the whole day, if his
strength held up. His summing up
closed the case and Federal Judge
Hunt was expected to instruct the
jury tomorrow morning.
The prosecutor first paid his re
spects to the attorneys for the de
fendants. "The worst crime they have
charged against me." he said, '"is
that I am not from New York. And
that sounds well coming from the
gentleman from New Jersey and the
gentleman from Poston." He re
ferred to R. V. Dindabury and
Charles S. Choate.
"Put the thing that hurts me most
was that Mr. Nicol criticized the
cut of iny coat," Batts declared. Atty.
Nicol interrupted to assure the gov

j remarks as a compliment.

International News S-rvbe:
WASHINGTON. Jan. 6. -
The
states and not the nation should pay
the national guard for any service it
renders, in the opinion of Sr-'y of
War Garrison. Openimr the light
for the administration's prepared
ness policy before the house military

made it plain that he was not any

Although manv members of the

Chairman Hay, in Iiis preliminary
eiraft of an army bill, has include.d
such a provision, Mr. Garrison frank

that any pay for home training
should come from the states them
selves. Deu'sn't Favor Militia.
Neither does Mr. Garrison place
the same faith in the organized
militia of the country as part of tin
national defenses that committee
members and othe r members of both
houses of rongress do. Ile.aus" of
