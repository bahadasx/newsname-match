said Major C. R. Wood, General I
Supt., of the Louisiana Fiber
Board Co., to the Enterprise(
yesterdoy. "Most of the im
provements have been completed
and little rnmains to be done but
we want to have ever .thing in ]
perfect omndition before we an
nounce the exact date so that no I
one will be disapointed," he
k added.
When the million dollar plant
does start it is certain to be a
busy scene for there is a big de
mand for their product and the
output for the first thirty days
has already been sold. The
plant will give employment to
at least 200 men, 50 of whom
will be skilled labor.
The improvements which are
nearing completion were started
several months ago and the cost
is estimated to have been many
thousand dollars.-Bogalusa En

GREAT SUliRNill TO 5lUlD
ANOTHEF BiG PLANT THIS YEAR
That B3ogalusa is de-. lned to
become 2ne of the b. w.ww nu
facturing cities I)f t,; " and
that not mnuch time P' lo),t
in making further iihe :r is
demonstrated by the .,ounce
ment that the Gre:+ , uthern
Lumber Company i!:. Thring
the coming year, erect a plant
to utilize part of the ::ws from
the mill. Details are hl icng as
to the kind of a plant tut will
be erecied, due to the fac:t that
the directors are undec -8l as to
which of the plants they will
build this year but tut loca
tion of the first plant has already
been decided upon. 'i'i, new
enterprise will be located on
Columbia Street, just opposite
the Bogalusa Laundry. Most
likely it will be a paper mill,
which will make a prowllat simi
lar to that known ais I:ver
Board. Recently a carload of
pull was siippeAd from Bog,,lusa
to a Canadian mill where a test
was made which is reported to
have been satisfactory. It is al
SO known that the Great South
ern Lumber Co., have expended
several thousands of dollars to
get reports on now to utilize the
enormous i aste at the Worlds
Greatest Mill and the reports
show that far more is wasted
than saved.
"The owners of the Great
I Southern Lumber Co., are now
operating the mill and they are
planning on how to save the
waste. We have planned to build
a plant during the coming year,
but to give the exact kind and
number it will employ, I am not
prepared to state at present,"
said General Manager, VW. H.

LETFERS FROM THE PEOPLE
Editor Era-Lteader:
I want to
writv something concerning the
political ilsue but I'mn so nervous
I can hardly hold my pen how
ever since there is so many
strange ideas and false criticisms
cnncerning the political issue
that I can hardly help trying to
meet sjme of them. What is a sur
price to me is when a man who
is a candidate before the people
and ii called upon to take up an
impor.ant issue and positively re
fusestodosoand his opoinen
agree., to take up an issue and to
all in nis powor to have thbo prin-`.
cipleýS f that issue enactel itnto:
law ad then some peo.'e will
doubt the sincerity of the man
that has talken up that issue be
cause his political enemies bring
up all kinds of criticisms against
him in order to defeat him. The
last dodge that I see against Mr.
Barret is that his enimies want to
snake ' _' ar that the Baptist
