VOL. XXXV.—NO. 37.
Washington, Jan. 3.—Congress re
assembles tomorrow in the midst of
an international situation which rival
political leaders admitted tonight was
one of the most critical that has Co»
fronted the nation.
Returning members talked of little
but consequences that might result
frome the sinking of the British
steamer Persia, in the Mediterranean,
with the loss of American life, and the
strained diplomatic relations between
the United States and Austria.
Although administration leaders
were uniformly inclined to proceed
cautiously and to await positive infor
mation, there was a general feeling
of uneasiness over the gravity of for
eign affairs.
Senator Stone, chairman of the sen
ate foreign relations committee, con
ferred with Secretary Lansing at the
state department and will seek a con
ference with President Wilson before
a meeting of the committee is held
Wednesday to begin consideration of
matters pertaining to the diplomatic
affairs of the nation.
It seems assured that the commit
tee will take up the resolution sub
mitted by Senator Hoke Smith calling
for an inquiry into Great Britain's in
terferences with neutral commerce and
the amendments by Senator Lodge to
investigate destruction of the Lust
tania and other acts by belligerents,
resulting in destruction of American
lives.
Graduates Teaching at
the Ends of the World
Of more than passing interest is
the great distance of points that have
called into teaching service graduates
of the State Normal school. Not
long ago someone said that the sun
hardly sets on the Alumni associa
tion, and the statement seems to be
almost true.
At Cebu, in the Philippine Islands,
Mrs. Grace Withee Smith is teaching
in a mission station. Mrs. Smith is
a member of the class of 1912, and
for a year was student assistant to
Prof. L. B. McMullen in the science
department.
Over in Natal, South Africa, Miss
Edith Conn, '05, has a teaching posi
tion at the Adams Mission station.
Both of these graduates still remem
ber the Normal school and they are
heard from not infrequently.
Far points in America have made
their appeal to other graduates. Mary
Power, '13, is teaching at Heppner,
Ore., and Else Currie and Bertha
Cameron, both 12, are teaching at
Monroe and Cashmere, Wash., re
spectively.
Grace Farley, '09, is teaching in
San Diego, and Edna Brown, '11, at
Santa Ana, Cal.
Roy Cross, '08 and Alfred Rhodes,
ex-'15, are teaching manual training
in the states of New Mexico and
Pennsylvania, respectively.

Gave Pretty Card Party
Mrs. H. N. Walker entertained 16
ladies at her home on Normal avenue
New Years evening. The rooms were
decorated in yellow and this color was
carried out in the cut. flowers which
adorned the rooms and also
in the refreshments which were
so daintily served. Whist was
the diversion of the evening and Mrs.
B. J. Haaland carried off the high
trophy, which was also in yellow, and
Mrs. J. W. Stull was low. The eve
ning was a very enjoyable one.
Gamblers Forfeit Bail
to Avoid Conviction
Monday afternoon in district court
in the case of the state vg. Stevens, on
a charge of gambling, defendant failed
to appear and his bail was declared
forfeited.
In the case of the state vs. Louis
Hanson defendant also failed to appear
and forfeited a cash bail of $125.
In the case of the state vs. Ben
Wayne, on a charge of gambling, de
fendant appeared with his attorney
and entered a plea of guilty. He was
sentenced to 30 days in jail and to pay
a fine of $75 and costs, the total
amounting to $100. Sentence was
modified to remit the 30 days when
fine and costs were paid.
The hold-up case was then called and
Is being tried. This is the case of the
young fellows who pulled off several
holdups north of town in a half hour
one evening and then duplicated the
performance after boarding a west
bound freight. Later they were cap
tured at Jamestown. The jury has
been secured and two witnesses exam
ined at the time of going to press.
Tom Nichols, Chorles Twickie, John
Andrews and Ed Severson are the de
fendants.
Gave New Years Dinner
Mr. and Mrs. O. L. Larson entertain
ed at a New Years dinner at their
home on Tenth avenue, covers being
laid for ten. An elaborate dinner was
served and the guests enjoyed the
afternoon and evening. The house
was bright with Christmas decorations
and carnations were scattered through
out the rooms.
Mrs. Perrine, mother of Miss Lura
Perrine, is very ill at her home on Nor
mal avenue, with a trained nurse in
attendance, having a very severe cold
which threatens to turn to pneumonia.
At her age such an illness is hard to
combat.
Miss Mertice Jobe went to Sheldon
Friday evening for a New Years and
over-Sunday visit with her friend, Miss
Esther Froemke, returning Sunday
night.

Lusitania Not Armed
Vessel, Berlin Admits
Washington, Jan. 3.—Germany no
longer contends that the Lusitania
could be classed as an armed vessel,
a contention which was advanced as
a justification for the destruction of
the ship with more than 100 American
lives.
Secretary Lansing disclosed today
that the contention has been aban
doned in the course of the negotia
tions for settlement now in progress
between the United States and Ger
many.
Secretary Lansing also indicated
that the United States probably will
take no steps in the case of the Japa
nese liner, Yasaka Maru, torpedoed
in the Mediterranean, because W. J.
Leigh, the only lost passenger, who
was supposed to have been an Ameri
can, never established his American
citizenship. Leigh was born of Amer
ican parents in China.

Claxton Wants Rural
Teachers Experienced
That teachers should be compelled
to teach in the city schools before be
ing allowed to take charge of a rural
school was a statement made by Dr.
P. P. Claxton, United States Commis
sioner of Education, in a recent ad
dress before the Normal school stu
dents. Dr. Claxton held that the in
experienced teacher should enter the
profession in the city schools, where
he is under direct supervision, a con
dition that does not obtain in the rural
school.
"The people who come from the
country to the city, let me say to
you," said the commissioner, "are
the people who are not smart enough
to live in the country so they come to
the city and get places as street car
conductors, or bookkeepers, or any
thing else that does not require as
much brain power as to get a living
out of the land—to be a farmer.

young men and women about the most

After his return home he served a
number of years in the local post office
as assistant to Postmaster Myhre. He

in Barnes county, and for the last two
years has held the responsible position

Mr. Peterson says in speaking of the
matter: "I have never before asked
the voters of Barnes county for any
office, but should they see fit to nom

entire time to the duties of the office
which I seek, and promise to the best
of my ability to discharge the duties
in an efficient manner. Having been
encouraged by numerous friends to
make the run, I respectfully ask the
voters of the county for a favorable
consideration next spring."

Grant Marsh, aged 83, the oldest
steamboat captain in actual service in
the United States, died in a Bismarck
hospital Sunday night. Marsh ran a
steamboat on the Missouri in the fit
ties and was up in the Yellowstone
river at the mouth of the Little Big
Horn at the time of the Custer maa
sacre. Curley, an Indian scout,
brought him news of the battle and
was followed by carriers of wounded
to his boat. Marsh made a famous ran,
breaking all records to Bismarck, and
brought news of the massacre to the
world.
Capt. Marsh spent several days In
Valley City last spring at the time
ot
the annual Model school entertain
ment, in which Custer's campaign was
dramatized by Misses Margaret C.
Burns and Susan W. Norton, critics,
in the Model school. Mr. Marsh was
invited to be present because of his
familiarity with early North Dakota
history and with General Custer. He
attracted a great deal of attention be
cause of his personality and made
many friends. Just recently he wrote
to Misses Burns and Norton, thanking
them for remembrances and for a copy
of the Blizzard, which he stated he had
deposited with the state historical so
ciety.
