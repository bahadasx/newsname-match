REED BACKS ADMINISTRATION
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5. Bonds of
restraint against public discussion
of International relations of the
United States In regard to the Eu
ropean war were broken In the sen
ate today and for more than an hour
the cession was enlivened by debate
orer the government's neutrality
policy, exports of war munitions and
travel by American citizens on bel-

There no division of th debaters
along party lines. Senator Jones of
Washington, republican, denounced aa
"unpartlotlc" American cltiaens who Im
perilled the nntion by tailing passago on
belligerent vesaels. Senator Works of
California, republican, asserted that the
government of the United States was
"hypocritically claiming to be neutral
when It was In fact participating In the
nsr through the sale of munitions."

Senator Ixi.lh'e. ranking republican
member of the foreign relations commit
tee, declared thnt to place an embargo
on arms now would be worth more to
Germany than a million men; that It
would be a "grossly unneutral act" and
would, In fact, make the I'nlted Statea
the ally of Germany. Senators O'Oorman
of New York mid Hitchcock of Nebraska,
both democrats, urped tlm advisability of
an embargo on munitions.
Senator O'Gorman alao Informed the
senate that American Consud It. N. Mc
Ncoly. who lout bin llfo on the British
liner Persia, had disregarded the advice
of American Cnnaiil General Skinner at
Ixindon that he make the Journey to Aden

had declined to heed Consul General Skin

debate on the position of the I'niied
States In the war by declaring the Ameri

fornia senator said:
"The government knew that the Lual

munition and explosives. Pasaengsrs

on the vessel. The government, itself In

Germany, and that the loan waa made
without protest from him or any other
cltlien? Does the senator not know that
Germany procured arms In this country

COMPLETE PLANS FOR
THE DODGEJUNERAL
Services to Bo Held from Home of
Deceased This Afternoon, with
Burial in Walnnt Hill.
MILITARY IN ALL DETAILS
No changes have been made in
the arrangement for the funeral of
General Orenvllle M. Dodge. It will
be held this afternoon at the Third j
street residence. Council Bluffs, be
ginning at 1 o'clock. The religious
services will be conducted by Rev.
A; O. A. Buxton, rector of St. Taul'a
Episcopal church, and Rev. J. T.
Jones, pastor of the First Congrega
tional church.
Although General Dodge was not
directly connected with any church
denomination, his broad liberality
made him the friend and benefactor
of every church in the city, and St.
Paul's and the First Congregational
were particularly favored by his gen
erosity. He was one of the founders
of the First Unitarian church estab- j
lished in this vicinity.
All of the panoply to be used In the
military funeral has been forwarded by
the War department from the federal
arsenal at Rock Islsnd. The field bat
tery gun caisson upon which the casket
mill be borne Is from the regulsr serv
ice equipment, it will be drawn by six
black horses. The black military har
ness for these horses Is a part of
the equipment forwarded. A black cav
alry saddle, taken from the service equip
ment, Is here. It will be placed In re
verse position upon the riderless horse
that will be led behind the artillery
caisson. The black sheet that will enve
lop the casket will be hidden by a huge
new silk flag that has never been un
furled. rian of Fanrral Procession.
The funeral cortege will be made up

For three houra yesterday afternoon the

The body of General Dodge lay in state,
resting upon a b'er placed in the main
parlor. The constantly moving throng
waa admitted at cne door and passed out
through another, without noise or con
fusion. Many paused more than a mo
ment as their eyes lingered on the well
known face. It was a strong, but kindly,
face. Every trace of pain had vanished
and an expression of absolute peace waa
there. Tears fell in spite of efforts to re
press them, but the strong emotion was
given no sound. The memory of the last
look Into that calm and tranquil face
will be treasured aa long as memory lasts.
The doors will be opened again thla
morning from : until 11 oclock. The
casket will then be closed and will not be
opened again to the public.

Grey Makes Rather Sarcastic
Answer to Germany's Complaint
LONDON, Jan. 4. (Delayed The sink
ing of the White Star liner Arabic, the
destruction of a British submarine by a
German destroyer on the Dsnlah coast

steamer Kuel are the three incidents that
Sir Edward Grey, the British foreign
secretary, suggests for submission to

German government complaining of cir

the foreign secretary wrote:

' By reason of this evidence, con
cludes the German note, "there Is no
doubt that Commandar MacHrlde of the
Baralong gave his crew the command
not to make prisoners certsln helpieaa,
unarmed German seamen, but to kill
them In a cowardly manner; also that
his crew obeyed the order and thua
shared the guilt for murder.
"The Oermsn government Informs the
British government of this terrible deed
and take It for granted t t . latter,
when they have examined h- . .eta in
the case and the affidavits, will Immedi
ately take proceedings for murder against
the commander of the Baralong and the
crew concerned in the murder, and will
punish them according to the laws of
war. They await In a very short time a
statement from the British government
that they have instituted proceedings fur
the expiation of this shocking Incident.
Afterwards they await information of the
result of the proceedings, which should
be hastemd aa much us possible, iu order
that they may conv:'ce themselves that

be disappointed In tills expectation tliey
would consider themselves obliged to take
serious decisions as to retribution for tho

ASQUITH DRAFT
BILL IS TAKEN UP
IN THE COMMONS
Premier Explains Proposed Measure
to Compel Unmarried Men
to Serve in the Brit
ish Army.
GREAT STRUGGLE IS EXPECTED v
Members Called Home from tho
Front to Aid in Passing
the Bill.
REPORT MADE BY EARL DERBY
LONDON, Jan. 6. Under the
terms of the compulsory military
service bill. Introduced In the House
of Commons today, all males between
the ages of 18 and 41 who are bach
elors or widowers, without children
dependent on them, are liable for
military service. Ireland Is excluded
from the terms of the measure.
The largest assemblage of mem
bers since the war began faced the
premier. Many members bad ob
tained leave to return from the front
so that they might be able to rote on
the compulsion bill.
Mr. Aaqulth opened his address with an
analysis of the figures in the Derby re-
port. He emphasised the fact that dur
ing the Derby campaign nearly 1,000,000
men had offered their services. Even
deducting those rejected on the ground
of physical disability, the total waa still
In excoas of l.wn.ono.
"These are wonderful encouraging fig
ures." the premier continued.
"They ought to convince both our al
lies and our enemies that the people of
this country have their hearts In the
war."
Many Hlnarle Men Still Oat.
Mr. Asqulth said he was unable, after
making the largest possible hypothetical
deduction, to consider the number of un
requited single men as anything but a
substantial and even considerable amount,
He added that Sir John Simon, whose
resignation as home secretary waa an
nounced yesterday, thought they might
be reduced to an Inestimable quantity.
if he had shared this view, Mr. Asqulth
said, the present contingency would not
have arisen, but he omild not think that.
The primary obligation , was to keep
faith at all costs with the married men.
The prime minister said exemptions
from service could be claimed under the
terms of the bill on the same grounds aa
In the case of men attested under the
Derby plan. The grounds of exemption
Include conscientious objection to per
forming military service.
Other grounds for exemption from serv
ice, the premier said. Included 111 health,
physical infirmities, the necessity to sup
port dependent persons and the fact of
being engaged on work of national Im
portance. -
Mr. Asqulth said no case had been made
out for general compulsion, anj thaVlhe '
bill he waa Introducing could be sup
ported by those opposed to. conscription.
Why Meaaare Is Needed.
LONDON, Jan. (.Delayed.) In the
Housevof Commons tomorrow (Wednes
day) the compulsory military service
bill will be taken up. It promises to brine
on the sharpest parliamentary struggle
since the war began.
The Earl of Derby's report on hla re
cruiting campaign which began October
23 and ended December 11, explains wby
the cabinet found it necessary to bring
forward a measure for compulsory en
listment of unmarried men. More than
