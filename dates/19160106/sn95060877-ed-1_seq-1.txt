The Municipal Stables, However, Also
Located on Prison Hill Constitutes One
of the Worst Nuisances in the City
and Furnishes a Bad Example in
the Enforcement of the City's
Sanitary Rules and Regulations
The story has been going the rounds for some time
that the Yuma Hospital empties its sewage into the Col
orado River just above the intake to the local water
works system; in fact none other than Frank Baxter
stopped me on the street a couple of weeks ago and
said such a report had just been made to him, and he
wanted to know if I knew
the matter. I frankly told him I did not, but that 1
would make a personal investigation as soon as Dr. H.
Apjohn, the city health officer, returned from his vaca
tion, and, thereupon, give the actual facts to the public.
Dr. Apjohn was almost indignant when I approach
ed him on the subject this afternoon, and denied it in
the most emphatic manner possible. I did not doubt his
word, but I wanted to see it with my own eyes, and he
gladly took me to the city hospital.
I found that not a particle of sewage from the hos
pital empties into the riverv It all goes in an up to date
septic tank, from which it is impossible for polluted
matter to escape. All the sewage pipes of the hospital
connect with this tank thereby rendering it impossible
for our drinking water to become contaminated with
the hospital sewage.

OH THIRD AVENUE
One of the most welcome items of
local news ,that has reached this
office lately is the report that the
city council has begun the work of
macadamizing Third avenue between
Second and Third streets. While any
street improvement is praiseworthy,
this is especially so as it leads in
front of the Randall Lee place, which
with its splendid orange and lemon
trees now full of their glorious gold,
eng fruit, affords the best show place
in town to interest the prospective
investor in our mesa lands.
This place is now in the care of
Al Thompson, who keeps everything
about the premises in perfect order,
demonstrating how well the citrus
fruits will thrive here without the
necessity of using smudge fires for
protection from frost. This place has
heretofore been practically inaccessi
ble to automobilists and our promo
tors have been abliged to take visitors
to it on foot or be content with a yjew
from a distance.
It is to be hoped that the work of
macadamizing the street will be rush
ed, as every day of delay may lose
us a desirable homeseeker.

YUMA GIRL ARE

ILL ABOUT THE BIRDS
(By B. F. Fly)
With over 200 specimens of
"skinned" bids as object lessons,
Mrs. J. W. Wheeler, of Tucson, fairly
electrified the pupils at both the High
and Grammar schools with her lec
tures this morning. She is a woman
of most charming and winsome per
sonality, as handsome as the very
plumage of the prettiest birds of her
splendid collection, and as vivacious
as a young Miss just out of school.
I had been specially invited to hear
her lecture at 1 o'clock this afternoon
but instead of that hour, she lectured
at 11 o'clock, though I didn't find this
out until I reached the high school
at the hour designated.
However, in company with Dr. Ap
john, Mrs. Frank Ming and Miss
Boehringer, the efficient county su
perintendent of schools, I had the
pleasure of a long talk with Mrs.
Wheeler at the Southern Pacific
hotel, where it was my pleasure to
listen to her for an hour as she pro
duced bird after bid from two or
thee lage suit cases and at a glance
gave their names, habits, whether
useful or destructive, and altogether
gave me more information about bird
life than I had ever heard before.
The lateness of the hour precludes
an extended story of her work, but I
hope to do this in tomorrow's issue.
In the meantime, I will simply say
that she is working in this particular
line for the University of Arizona,
and I am quite sure her work is of
great value to the state.
