in House of Commons,
PREMIER INTRODUCES
BILL FOR COMPULSION
Declares Young, Unmarried
Men Must Take Their
Share in Defense of Assail
ed British Nation,
IfV MORNINQ JOURNAL RCIAL LCASiO WIRtl
London, Jan. 6 (4:45 p. m.) Sir
I Jonn simon, wnose resignation, as
name secretary was announced yes
terday, made a speech in the house
of commons today In which, after
expressing regret that he had found
it necessary to sever his relations w ith
Premier Asquith, he pleaded for rejec
tion of the compulsory service bill.
When the national register was
taken fir John said tho country was
given a pledge that it had nothing
to do with compulsion.
The present hill. Sir John said, rep
resented legislation first, and humify
afterwards. t
"Voluntarism is u birthright of the
nation," ho continued. "Let tho gov
ernment be sure that if they sell It
for a mess of pottage they are get
ting a square meal."
Sir John denied that the facts Jus
tified tho assertion that young men
! had refused to pay their debt to tho
country, adding:
"Do not let us pay Prusslun mili
tarism tho compliment of imitating
the worst of its Institutions."
I'nder the terms of Mm compul
sory military service hill. Introduced
in the house of commons today, all
males between the nges of IS and 41
who are bachelors or widowers with
out children dependent on them, are
liable for military service.
Ireland is excluded from the terms
of tho measure.
Tho largest assemblage of mem
bers since the war bestitn faced the
premier. Many members had ob
tained leave to return from the front,
so that they might be able to vote
on tho bill.
The K.iii of Derby, who conducted
tne recruiting campaign, was in tiie
peers gallery.

"Thes,

ire wonderful, ncmmigiug
figures," the premier continued.
"They ought to convince both our
allies and our enemies that the peo
ple of this country have their hearts
In the war."
What the Ucport Shows,
Th? Karl of Derby's report on his
cum paly 11, which begun October
and ended December 11, explains why
the. cabinet found It necei.sary to
bring forward a measure for compul
sory enlistment of unmarried men.
More than 2,r,o0,00o men In Kngland,
Scotland, aim Wales enrolled them
selves, but after those engaged In In
dispensable Industries and medically
unt it have been winnowed out about
1,100,000 available men to bear arms
remain. liut there are 450,000 un
married mon who failed to come for
ward ami the government will now
attempt to redeem Premier Asipiith'r
pledge, that the married men should
not be called out as long as u consid
erablo fraction of unmarried men held
back.
In his report, which s addressed
to Earl Kitchener, secretary for war,
the Earl of Derby says:
"Many difficulties have been met
with, but. the chief difficulty hah been
thu unreliability of starring, us dis
tinguishing between those who should
and those who should not be tsken
for the army. Instead of starring
being an assistance it bus been u
distinct hindrance to tho canvass.
Unequal Treatment.
"Another obstacle to recruiting has
been the unequal treatment of indi
viduals. Parents and relations, espe
cially, cannot understand why their
son, hus'bunds or brothers should
join while other young men hod hack
and secure lucrative employment at
home.. Apart from th number of
men who have actually- enlisted nnd
attested there are many who have
nromised to enlist when 'su and ho'
has also promised to go. There may

slightest sign but that the country as
a whole Is determined to support the

made. Tin-re Is un abundance of ev

The prime, minister said exemptiots
from service could be claimed under
the terniH of the bill on tho same
grounds as In the ease of men attest
ed under tho Derby plan. The grounds
of exemption include conscientious op
position to perform military service.
Other grounds for exemption, the
premier said, included ill health, phy
sical infirmities, tbo necessity to sup-
port dependent persons and 'the fact
of being engaged on work of national i
importance.
The bill, Mr. Asquith continued,
was limited specifically to redemption
of the promise he had made publicly
to married men. This pledge had
been given at a time when over
whelming evidence hud 'been submit-

T hey needed to be reassured that,
having regard for thel rclrcumstaneos
and tho business

of service being postponed Until the
younger ami single men had been
called up. Jf assurance hud not been
given at that lime there would have
been danger that tho whole recruiting
cainpalf.n would break down.
"Where, then, should be wo
now?" ho asked.
The premier added that If he were
to be confronted with tho same situa
tion at he present time he would
take precisely the. same course;'. lie
said he hud received no protect
against his pledge.
Although ho had been a strong .sup
porter of . t ho . system of voluntary

I Senator Weeks blazed the way to
gellernl debute On the position of the
) United Stab s In the war by declaring
the American government was not
neutral.
Asserting at the outset that the gov.
eminent shared responsibility for
deaths of American on the Lusitmiia,
Senator Works, of California, said;
1 Works Goes Off llall't s l,ed.
"Tbo government knew that the
Lusitamu was loaded to the guiirils
with 1, 111 11 11 i t ion and explosives. Pas
sengers wire permitted In spUi; of
this to travel on t lie vessel. The
government Itself, in full knowledge
that the shin carried munitions of
war, Is morally responsible for thu
deaths of our citizens."
When Senator Works declared the
United States actually was partici
pating In the war by the snlo of mu-
nlllons. Senator Heed, democrat, in
j terrupted to ask:
"Docs the senator not know that
tin- first ton ti placed in this country

OOO, 000 to Germany and thai the
loan was made without protest from
him or any other eltinen? Does the
senator not know that Germany pro

"That inuy all b: true," Kenulor

"It Is impossible to gel at'ma 10
