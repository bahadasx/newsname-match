Influenza is spreading over the
United States from coast to
coast in the most serious epidemic
ever known, takings large
toll in lives and causing economic
loss by incapacitating workers in
all walks of life, says a Washington
despatch. Reports from
public health service officers,
made public by Surgeon General
Blue, show that already the disease
has created a grave problem
for many of the large cities and
is spreading to the rural communities.
Cleveland and Detroit 1
each have probably 100.000 \{

CANNOT ESCAPE LAW
BY PAYMENT OF FINE
"Section 811. Any person who
violates any of the provisions
of sections 794 to 803 inclusive
shall be pruilty of a misdemeanor
and upon conviclion thereof shall
be imprisoned at hard labor for
not less than six months nor mnrp
than five years, and for any subsequent
offense, upon conviction,
shall be imprisoned for a term of
not less than one year nor more
than five years: Provided, That
any circuit judge may in his discretion
suspend all of such imprisonment
except three months
upon such terms and conditions
as he may see fit to impose, but
in each and every case any person
convicted of the violation of
the said sections shall be required
to serve at the least three
months of the sentence imposed
upon him."
The above is a section of an
amendment to the State's whiskey
law which will be introduced
bv Representative J. T. Liles, of
Orangeburg, at the coming set -'
sion of the general assembly. In
the opinion of Mr. Liles, fear of
punishment, so far as the criminally
inclined are concerned, is
the greatest incentive to respect
and regard for law.
"I hope and believe," said Mr.
Liles, "I shall be successful in
securing the passage of this bill
end its pnfnrpomcnf no n i?~. : ?
?..u.vvmviii. ao a law in
my opinion practically rids South
Carolina of the evils of the liquor
traffic. The failure of the prohibition
laws of this and other
States has been due largely to
the fact that the penalties imposed
did not sufficiently punish.
This will not be the case under
this bill."
An Old Yorkville Stamp.

letter of the kind in use before

happens to bear the postmark
of "Yorkville," S. C." It is addressed
to "Messrs. Hull & Spencer,
New York," and in addition
to the address carries the notation
"Charge Box 47. S. & I." Ten
cents, the amount of the postage,
is stamped on the right hand
corner of the envelope at the top,
and the word "paid" is printed
beside the stamp. The envelope;
as it is known today, did not
come into use until 1847, and this

that time. There is nothing

Latest despatches concerning
the sinking Thursday of the
British ship Persia, indicate that
Robert N. MoNW?lv

two other Americans are known
to have been passengers on the
Persia when she left London.
Charles II. Grant was on his
way to Bombay. Edward Ross,
a school boy, was on the way
from Denver to Gibraltar. Ross
probably landed at Gibraltar and
was not on board the boat at
the time she was sunk.
A Lloyds dispatch says that
most of the passengers and men
of the Persia were lost.
Four boats got clear before
the Persia sank.
The message to Lloyds says
1 T"V
cne rersia was on her way from
London to Bombay. She was
sunk at I o'clock on Thursday
afternoon.
The Peninsular and Oriental
Line estimates that 160 or 161
passengers sailed from London
an the Persia. A number of
these landed at Gibraltar. Marseilles
or Malta.
The Persia was sunk in the
?astern Mediterranean off the
Island of Crete.

CHAIR AWAITS NEBRO
IF GUIIJIS PROVEN
Odessa Good, a negro youth
16 years old, is in the county
jail at York charged with attempted
criminal assault upon a
six-year-old white girl, the
A Ua_- - -
uauKiuer 01 a prominent farmer
living in Bethel township. The
alleged crime was committed on
the premises of the girl's father
Wednesday afternoon, but was
not discovered until Thursday.
The negro who lives on the same
farm with his brother-in-law,
was arrested Thursday afternoon
by Constable Horace Johnson
and taken to jail.
The child was given prompt
medical attention as soon as her
condition was discovered and
attending physicians say she will
recover entirely. It is understood
that the negro has confessed
his crime. He appeared
sullen and mean when questioned
by newspaper men and appeared
not to appreciate the serious
position he is in. He is a grandson
of Giles Good, who with
four other negroes, Brindley
Thompson, Bailey Dowdle, Dan
Roberts and Mose Lipscomb,
were lynched on the outskirts of
York April 5, 1887, for the mur
der of a white boy in Bullocks
Creek township.
"I am not expecting trouble
over this affair," said Sheriff
Hugh G. Brown. "The partn s
of the outraged child have expressed
their wish that the law
be allowed to take its course,
and I believe the good citizens
of York county will respect their
wish."
There is to be a total eclipse of
the sun Thursday, February 20.
