Gettysburg.
Here we are in the beginning
of the year 1916, and with differ
ent weather than during the latt
week of the old year. What this
change may presage is hard to
tell, but we may suspect that it
augurs for the better at least
we hope a better era in every
way will come to us. The open
ing year has many possibilities
for U3 if we only know how to
appropriate them and secure the
most and best within our reach.
Let an honest and earnest en
deavor be made to improve upon
the past. The year -has opened
auspicious.
Our M. E. Sunday school elec
ted officers for the year as , fol
lows : P. B. Moul, Supt.; . Ed
Swinger, Wt Supt.; J. H.
Kniesly, Secy; Lloyd Dershera,
Ass't Sec'y: Lewis Erisman,
Treas.; Esther Kniesly, Organ
ist; Lucille Swank Ass't Organ:
ist; Mrs. Sophia Dershem, Supt.
Home Dept. ; Mrs. Jennie Eris
man, Supt Mission Dept.; Mrs.
Stella Hahn, Supt. Cradle Roll
Dept. ; and I. M. Petersime, Tea
cher of Teachers.
Revival begins in our M. E.
church tomorrow night, to con
tinue indefinitely. ; Whether this
is the opportune time for the
meeting may be a question on
account of the; grippe 'affliction
that is uoon us. S Experience will
telL - Many of our people are
suffering from it and a severe
form of it. It seems to pi e vail
as an epidemic.
Our schools began today aftur
a holiday vacation, and I suppose
we may expect large results af
ter a vacation rest and recupera
tion. The stork found its way to the ,
home of Walter Burnett and left
a nine-pound boy for these .good
people to nurture and,, care ior.
This was a generous act, , but it
did not take Walter by surprise
A like visitation occurred at the
home of Jim Johnson,
We have had a New Year's
flood, but it did not- reach the
height of the flood of 1913, yet it
got high enough to arouse appre
hension. Our new, officers, both town
ship and city, were duly installed
in office last Saturday, from which
time they, will discharge, their re-s
spective duties for the term., of
the various offices to which cho
sen, and wmay:expect -good re
sults for the people, whose ser
vants they are. Surely, they will
do their best and deserve the ap
probation of their constituency.
What will our Congress do a
boutthe question of prepared
ness? This is a momentous ques
tion in some ways, and in one
way it is a vague question. It
will be a'difflcult question to de
termine what - is preparedness.
Some may think the expenditure
of $300,000,000 or more invested
, alone in a navy would be prepar
- edniss and nothing less, to say
netting as to what ought to be
expended for the army, while
other may ; be? of opinion that
half tfot amount or much less
would be preparedness. It is ar
gued that a large preparedness is
only an incentive to aggresion
nd military glory. I suppose it
will make little difference what
the constituency may think or
say about the matter of prepar
edness the fellows in the saddle
and doing the business, for the
country will do what they deem
is for the best, and the support
ers of the government will have
to pay the bill, whatever Jt may
be. There is one question far
more important than simply pre
paredness, whether on a large or
small scale, and that is, how to
use that preparedness when once
provided. If . the brain is clear
and moderated by a patriotic du
ty. and avoid the slaughter and
carnage of war, and all . other
matters pertaining to such a con
dition, it will be worth "many
times preparedness.
Ed Brown and family moved
from Abbottsville yesterday into
the home of Sarah Murphy and
will operate the grist mill near
this place.

For Rheumatism.
As soon as an attack of Rheu
matism begins apply Sloan's Lin
iment Don't waste time and
suffer unnecessary agony. A few
drops of Sloan's Liniment on the
affected parts is all ' you " need.
The pain goes at ODce.
A grateful sufferer writes:
"I was suffering for three weeks
with Chronic Rheumatism and
Stiff, Neck although I tried many
medicines, they failed, and I was
under the care of a doctor. For
tunately I heard of Slo&n's Lini
ment and after using it three or
four days am up and well. I am
employed at the biggest depart
ment store in S. F. where they
employ.from six to eight hund
red hands, and they surely will
hear all about Sloan's Liniment. ' '

Shipbuilding.
Sixty sea-going steel ships, ag
gregating 288,701 gross tons, are
now being built in American
shipyards. This is the heaviest
tonnage ever under construction
in this country at one time. There
is no reason, to suppose that Am
erican shipyards will go out -ot
businessfwhenjthewar closes. If
H ..
we, bring to shipbuilding ; the
same genius and energy we have
taken into other lines of busi
ness, we can hold our own with
any competitors; and the des
truction of merchant ships in this
war is so great that there will be
a good demand for such vessels
for a long time to come. Chica

Begin Fight on Tree
Blight.
The fall and early winter
months afford an excellent oppor
tunity to clean up the orchard and
to wage a fight against fruit dis
eases, according to the depart
ment of horticulture, Ohio State
University. All diseased and
blight infested parts of the trees
should be cut out and burned.
'he blight during the past season
has been worse than usual and
care must be taken to prevent its
spread if the orchard is to be sav
ed ..lJu cutting. out. blighted parts
the dead bark should be cut away
eaving in sharp contrast the live
portion. The dead part is the
owest margin of the blight.
Household Items.
To remove stains from a mat
tress, cover with a paste of raw
starch and water. When dry
brush off with a whisk broom.
'ruit stains on white material
will usually give way to soaking
in thick sour milk. Rinse n luke
warm water without soap arid re
peat if necessary. Before wash
ing blue linen or white embroid
ered with blue, s.oak the article
for an hour in water to which one
ounce of sugar of lead has been
added to each gallon of water.

Obituary.
Jacob Peiffer, second son of
Joseph G. and Lena Peiffer, and
one of a family of six children,
was born in Berks county, Penn
sylvania, June 12, 1848, and died
in his home in Gettysburg Dec-
ember 22, 1915. aged seventy ne
years, six months and ten days
He came to this state with his
parents wh m aged two years and
spent his boyhood on the farm. He
was a precocious boy and at fle
age of sixteen years felt it ms
duty to respond to the call of his
country then engaged in civil
war, and on May 2, 1864, entered
the military service of his coun
try as a member of Co. C, 152nd
Regt O. V. I., and served in this
organization to September 2,
1864, when he was honorably
discharged, and while so serving
he performed his duty as a vali
ant soldier and was never known
to shirk any duty. Following
his discharge he learned the
blacksmith trade and ever fol- j
owed it in his home village the
remainder of his life.
On February 4, 1875, he was
united in marriage to Millie A.
Shimp, to which union were born
six children, viz: Edith, of Cin
cinnati: Verne and Walter, of
this vicinity; Harley, of Muscc-
