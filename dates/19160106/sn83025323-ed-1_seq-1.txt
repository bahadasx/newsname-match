That young Havre business man
that raised such a rumpus at Malta,
jumped out of town the other day
and cleft not a few creditors to
mourn his loss.-Havre Democrat.
GOOD TIMES IN MONTANA
Old saying, "As is Butte and Ana
conda so is Montana," is very true.
With smelters and mills snapping
and cracking with the hum of indus
try in those places bespeaks prosper
ty for the entire state. And the
whole thing is blamed on the present
high price of copper. In this regard
the Butte Miner of a recent date
says:
"With high grade copper selling
today at 201/2 cents a pound, its
highest since 1907, Wall Street
looks for another boom in that in
dustry."
ADVERTISING ALWAYS PAYS.
A few years ago a young man full
of vim and ginger found his way to
the city of Minot. He was a phar
macist by profession and in the face
of four established drug stores in
vested spare capital in a fifth. As
one of the basic principles of his
business he set aside five per cent
of his gross receipts to expend 4or
advertising. His business grew
from the very start and the second
year he increased his advertising ap
propriation to five per cent of the
gross receipts. It was not long be
fore he owned two large stores in
Minot and one or two in neighbor
ing towns. Today Paul V. McCoy,
for that is the young man's na.me,
conducts in addition to his other
business one of the largest depart
ment stores in the state and is re
garded as one of the most successful
business men. He still sets aside
the usual five per cent for advertis
ing and finds it his most profit
able investment.

WILLIE EXPLODED.
A week or two ago Dan McGovern
of the Glasgow Democrat, blew up
over their senatorial timber down
there, and being unable to use, and
this week Willie Rhodes, in the
News, explodes. It grieves a lot of
the dissatisfied politicians in the old
county became their offspring is
able to do things she would delight
in doing if the tables were turned.
Well, Willie, the Little Doctor is
still senator of Valley county, and
we are going to slip you some in
side information; something we got
on the quiet, and it might be of in
terest to you and the sagebrush
orator, and a few of those who were
weighed and found a little shy. We
found out just how you can get rid
of the Doctor as state senator from
Valley county. Of course you will
have to work in the dark, but that
will be no handicap to you and the
fellows who want his job. The in
formation we are going to give out
is the very latest and strictly confi
dential. In fact we got this from
"Doc" himself, so it is reliable. His
friends in Phillips county will vouch
for every word of it.
The Doctor said, only this morn
ing, if a law was passed that would
prohibit his living in Malta and rep
resenting Valley county in the sen
ate, he would resign. Such a law
could not be enacted until the next
session of the legislature, and "Doc"
has just about reached a point where
he would vote for such an unjust
measure just to get away from a few
who do not appreciate his services
as a law maker. You might as well
try to knock a flee off a dog's ear
with a boxing glove as to pry the
Doctor loose from his friends up
here. No, Willie, on the Q. T., you
will have to have such a law passed
for the Doctor might make up his
mind to run again in old Valley
county, and you know what he did
do to your pet candidates in the
past, and history will repeat itself.
Trains from the east and west
still continue to arrive in Malta sev
eral hours late, due to the extreme
cold weather and storms in the
mountains.
