MRS. MARRY E. STINE, MARRIED
One day last week, unknown to
friends here, Mr. J. D. Anderson of
Tawas City, Mich., came to this place
and without asking any of us took un
to himself as wife, Mrs. Mary E. Stine
of 4th Street They were quietly
married at Monroe, Mich., after which
they left for their home in Tawas City.
We venture the assertion that if we
get hold of "Dal," we'll at least make
him put up the cigars for so secretly
carrying on his operations in this
town. We admit that is once Mich,
has it on Ohio.
J. D. Anderson was formerly a res
ident of Center Twp. and his good wife
of Webster Twp., Wood County.
Sweethearts in youth, they each
married others, now to be reunited at
last in the realities of married life.
,We wish them happiness and success
in their new home.

In conversation with Rev.
Father Kicble of St. Rose's church
we learn that the now movie thea
ter will open on Monday night,
January 10. The new movie housu
is eiie of the best.equipped.jind
up-to-date in the state. A state
inspector was here last week and
pronounced the Building and its
appurtenances to be more perfect
than 90 per cent of similar houses
in Toledo.
There are seats' for 20S people
although there is room for about
80 additional chairs which can be
added at any time.
The space between rows is much
wider than required by law; the
aisles are, wider; there are ade
quate exits and in every way it is
a model play house.
One of the most important fea
tures is the screen and in this Rev.
Kieble has shown that expense is
not to be considered where excel
lence is desired, as he has furn
ished a Miuusa gold fibre screen,
a duplicate of that in the Temple
theatre, Toledo.
Contract has been made with
one of the big film companies for
showing their Master Pictures,
known by the profession as the
highest grade films of high class
subjects. Here, again, expense is
not spared.
For the first week the theatre
will be open every night, but the
following week on Wednesday and
Saturday only.
The picture for the opening will
be tho "Outcast" one of the
Master Pictures and should be
seen by everybody.
The admission price is placed at
10 cents, the same as all other first
class movies where high class pic
tures are shown.
A liberal patronage by all our
people should be accorded this
enterprise which has long been de
sired and needed in Perrysburg.
Right in line with tho Banner of
Progress ntjihe head of the column
tho farmers of Perrysburg town
ship and vicinity are already mak
ing preparations for the mid
winter Institute, which will be
hold at the' town hall, on Wednes
day and Thursday, Febmary 16
and 17, 191G.
The programme for the two
days session will bo published
later.

by the state are:

The Jones Concert Co., will
