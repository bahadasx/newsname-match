London, Jan. G. The Kus
sian pressure on the Austrian
lines from Volhynia to Ilukowi
n a continues heavy with san
guinary battles.
Reports of the evacuation of
Czernowitz by the Austrians
are unconfirmed.
Petrograd claims that the
Russians have compelled the
defenders to fall back to their
secondary defense and definite
ly assume the defensive.
The French are pounding on
the German trenches in Cham
pagne and claim that the bom
bardment has done damage i
there.
Berlin says the French gren
ade attcak on the German line
at Lenesnil was easily repulsed,
adding that the allied artillery
is shelling the important town
of Lens, northeast of Arras.

Reports Still Conflicting.
London, Jan. ii. While I lie fate
of Czernowitz is obscured in eonfliet
ing reports, it appears evident that
the Russians dominate the Bukowina
capital. Unofficial dispatches from
Petrograd state that the Austrians
have evacuated the town under press
lire from the Russians holding the
heights above it, while from Ausriiin
sources the information has been re
ceived that the Austrian troops hare
been withdrawn from a portion of the
city.
Czernowitz lies in a" deep valley.
The town it.;rlf is not of great strat
egical value, except for its railroads.
Its frll is likely to have greater po
litical than military signfieanee. "as
an outstanding success by the Rus
lans at this time would be likely to
have a far-reaching effect on Rou- j
mania.
A dispatch to a Berlin newspaper
from the Bukowina front describes
the fighting there since Christmas
day as unexampled. The Russians

have concentrated o 20il guns and
three divisions of infan y on a front'
of three-quarters of a mile. The'
battle reached its height on Hoc. 2S.
when the Russians attacked fourteen !
times and there was furious hand-j
lo-hand lighting.
While the battle on the borders of i
Bessarabia is apparently still far from
decided, each day finds the Russians
claiming the occupation of additional!
positions, and Petrograd believes that:
if this process continues a short time;
longer a break must come somewhere'
in the lines of the central powers.
The whole energy of the Russian
army is being directed to making n1
gap between the German armies in J
the center and the southern Austrian1
forces. The desperate attacks in thel
region of Koliki are designed to pre
vent this. The fighting must con-,
tinue for a considerable time yet,
but on the result will depend in a;
large measure the strategy of both!
sides when spring comes. J

would confine themselves to the ex

No important events have taken
place on the wesiern line in France

LEFIT SOCIETY
HAS ALL IT CAN ATEND TO WITH
OUT ARDMORE BEING MADE
DUMPING GROUND FOR OTHER
CITIES.
The Benevolent Society is still face
to face with the problem of taking
care not only of the resident needy
of this city but a mass of others
who have been furnished transporta
tion to this city by other towns and
counties, and given to understand
that Ardmore is a good place to got
food and clotnmg without the neces-1
sity of working for same.
At a recent meeting of the society,
it was decided that in the future all
who applied for assistance will have
to show a mighty g-ood case as to why
they came to Ardmore for this assist
ance, or they would not got help. Mrs.
Kahn, president of the society, and
Mrs. Curtis, probation officer, have
boon very busy for the past three
weeks looking after the itinerants,
and they have about exhausted their
patience.
Mrs. Curtis states that the city
and county officers will bo called upon
in the future to investigate the new
comers, and if it can be done, they
will be shipped back to where they
came from, rather than bo allowed to
remain charges of the society.
The Board of County Commission
ers also has calls made upon it at
every meeting, and yesterday an old
man asked that transportation bo fur
nished him to Galveston, Tex., when'
ho Said he has relatives living. He
was furnished with a ticket. This is
but one instance of everyday occur
rences with the Benevolent society.
The officers have boon called upon
K0 (,ften f,. transportation that they
have finally decide dnot to furnish
same to anyone in the future, but
when deemed expedient to rid the
city of someone, ask the police de
partment to make up the purse, which
they always do. A call has been is
used for the Benevolent society to
meet, and some drastic action will
taken.

i According to reports, Wirt has been
a pretty wide open proposition for
some time, but employes and opera

towns. The employes are all well

SPEEBERS
SAYS HE IS TIRED OF HAVING
THEM PULL AHEAD OF FIRE
DEPARTMENT WHILE IT IS
MAKING RUNS.
Fire Chief Reeder was "mad clear
through" this morning when he re
turned to the station after making a
run on a false alarm and stated in
most positive terms that the very
next auto driver who chased after
the department or in any way Inter
fered with them in the discharge of
their duty, is going to feel the hard
hand of the law.
Mr. Reeder stated that there aro
s(vcral drivers in this city, particu-
larlv vnnmr hnvs who never over-
look an opportunity of speeding UD
j their machines whenever an alarm of
j fire is turned in. On several occasions
'accidents have been narrowly averted,
! and this morning, had it not been for
j the presence of mind of the driver
of the auto truck, an auto would have
been smashed and the driver, a
young boy, would probably have been
I killed.
I The chief stated that this is the
last warning he will pive the public
about this matter, and that the very
next one w ho takes advantage of a
"re alarm to speed up, w ill be nan-
