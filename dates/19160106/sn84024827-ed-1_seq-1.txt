Premier Asquith Speaks for
an Hour Before Poular
Branch of Parliament in Be
half of Conscription Bill.
BIGGEST ATTENDANCE
SINCE WAR BEGAN
Earl Kicthener, at the Same
Time, Addresses House of
Lords on the Necessity of
Adopting Compulsory Law.
LONDON. Jan. 5. The British gov
ernment definitely embarked on a poli
cy of compulsory military Service
when Premier. Asquith submitted to
the House of Commons a bill drafting
eligible unmarried men to military du-J
ty and championed the measure in a
stirring speech on the necessity of the
step.
The scene in the House of Commons
was the most notable in the history of
that body. Members packed the bench
es and all the ministerial seats were
occupied. The galleries were over
flowing. With the prospect of a keen
duo! between the Premier and his for
mer colleague. Sir John Simon, over
compulsion which caused the tatter's
resignation, the biggest assemblage of
Commoners since the outbreak of the
war faced Asquith when he introduced
the bill.
"" Virtually the only absentees were
those debarred from attending by mili
tary necessities. These, to a man, fav
or ccmmilsory service. There is "in
England an intense interest over the
culmination of the controversy which
has riven the country as not other e
vert of th ewar."
That the step held popular interest
was reflected by the crowds congregat
ed outside the Parliament building.
Shouts of welcome greeted - Premier
Asquith as he appeared with his wife
and daughters. Officers in uniform oc
cupied seats among the members, and
in the galleries, giving a distinct kha-l
ki color to the gathering. Back of As
quith sat Sir John Sinion. In the gal
lery, facing the Premier, was Earl
Derby, the" central figure leading to
day's climax. Asquith spoke continu
ously for an hour.
The House of Lords was ihe scene
of another debate on conscription,
hardly less animate than that in the
House of Coni-rons as Earl Kitchener,
Secre'ary of War, urged the impera
tive necessity of strengthening the ar
my by the means now proposed.
RESIGNS FROM CABINET
LONDOK, Jan. 5. Sir. John Simon,
whose resignation as Home Secretary
was announced yesterday, addressed
the House of Commons. He expressed
regret that he found it necessary trt
sever his relations with Premier As
nuith and nleaded for the rejection of
the compulsory service bill. He said
it represented legislation first and in
quiry afterwards.
ONE POINT TROUBLESOME
LONDON. Jpn. 5. The Irish section
al issue is considered likely to prove
a troublesome point in carrying out
the compulsion measure, which Premi
er Asquith introduced In the House of
Commons. An Ulster member pro
posed a resolution, framed by Fir Ed
ward Carson, denouncing the proposal
tn on ilt Ireland as an "insult and a
humiliation to the loyal patriotic pop
ulation and an abandonment of the
principal of equality of sacrifice in
jesty
subjects in the United King-
dom.'
IN THE LORDS
LONDON. Jan. 6. The fullest and
fairest trial had been given the 'volun
tary system, declared Field Marshal
Earl Kitchener. In addressing the
House of Lords.
"We are now asking Parliament to
sanction a change," said Kitchener,
"as it has proved that in the special
circumstances of this unprecedented
struegle the existing systenf, without
modification, is not equal to maintain
ing an trmy which Is needed to secure
victory-"
I Compulsion, he added,' effects during
the period of the war only, one class of
men, those who have but a poor idea
of their duties 'as citizens.

Prohibitive Levy Decree By
De Facto Government is
, Subject of Objection By
American Mining Interests.
EL PASO, Jan. 5. Negotiations of
the International Mining Association
with the de facto government officials
for the annulment of the decree which
places the income taxes on mines and
their output,. Are fruitless, according
to Mexico City advices. ; I '
Mining men contend the decreed
taxes are prohibitive. They say nearly
all of the 440,000 claims in Mexico will
be cjomoelled to discontinue operations
under the terms of the decree.-. ''
Cnrranza. according to reports, con
tends the decree,, by .fixing a graduated
tax on holdings of more than ten
claims, tends to discourage monopol
ies and is similar to the operation of
the income tax law in the United
States. .
Edward Farley and J.'J. Hurley, em

Minaca, in western Chihuahua, arrived
on .the border. They said they had

: LONDON, January 5. The battle on
the borders of Bessarabia apparently
is far from a decision. The Russians
each day claim the occupation of ad
ditional enemy positions. Petrograd
believes the continuance of short
gains will bring a break somewhere in
the Teuton lines. The whole energy of
the Russian army is directed to mak
ing a gap between the German armies
center and the southern Austrian
forces. Desperate Austrian attacks In
the region of Kolkl are Designed ',t
prevent this. Upon their result de
pends the strategy of both sides when
spring comes.
Comparative quiet on other fronts.
The attitude which labor will take re
garding conscription at the confer
ence in London tomorrow is a matter
or anxiety to England. Robert Wil
liams, leader of the important Trans
port Workers' Federation,, declared
tonight:
"It Is practically assured that the
conference will aftirm the rejection of
conscription in any form."
The story of the Baralong case has
created a wide sensation. A consid
erable part of the English press ques
tions the veracity of the witnesses.
The Globe expresses doubt whether
there are such persons as Larimore
Holland and Suggests that the next
time von Bethmann Hollweg's subor
dinates invent witnesses they should
provide some who are more convinc
ing. There is general expectation that
Germany will express dissatisfaction
at Sir Edward Grey's reply by imme
diately instituting reprisals which
English men, fear may take violent
form.

PHOENIX. Jan. 5. The ' com-'
plete elimination of the Western
Federation of Miners from the
Clifton-Morenci District was today -deciderf
on by the strikers, who,
through the citizens' committee of
Clifton, requested and were grant
ed a conference with the mine
managers. The conference will be
held at El Paso January 12.
The fact that the striker have
determined to eliminate the Fed
eration from the district was in
dicated when the executive com
. mittee of the striking miners
asked the Clifton Citizens' Com
mittee to try to arrange for a con-'
ference with the manager rela
tive to adoption of the increased
wage scale recently proposed and
asked that such meeting bef held
a week from today. By that time, ,
they said, the Western Federation
would be entirely eliminated from
the district. ,
The Citizens' Cim mittee at once
wired the managers who, in reply,
apreed to a conference a week
from today and to keep open in the
meantime the proposed scale of
wages which will amount to a five
per cent increase.
They further agreed to make the
scale applicable to high prices of
copper now prevailing, the only
condition being that the federation (
be completely eliminated and that'
satisfactory proof of its elimina
tion be furnished at the meeting.
Adjutant General Harris, who left'
last night for Clifton, arrived .
there today, according to advices
received here. The recall of Har
ris was seriously considered at the
capitol today as the situation pri
or to his arrival at Clifton was as
near perfect as could be hoped.

SAN FRANCISCO. Jan. 5. Secret
service operatives arrested three men
on the charge of issuing counterfeit
foreign money.. One of the men, Rob

Widney and said he had just paid
him $3500 in American money in ex

SUEZ-EGVPTIAH
OA UFA I ON
POSSIBLE
Associated Press Correspon
dent Tells How Turkish-Austrian-German
- Offensive
Against Canal will Start.
CONSTANTINOPLE. Jan.- 5. A
campaign of Turkish and German
forces against the Suez Canal and
Egypt would not be as difficult an en
terprise as the factors involved would
seem to i:idcate, accordng to the
opinion held by military authorities
here. Tby say that those contend
ing that such an undertaking would
be next to impossible are unfamiliar
with the means of communication be
tween Constantinople and the Canal,
and overlook that the food resources
of Arabia and Syria are fully suffi
cient to meet the needs of a large
army.
L3st May and June, the Associated
Press correspondent travelled over
the greater part of the route which
an army marching against the Suez
Canal would have to use. He found
the following.
From Constantinople to Bosauti in
the Taurus mountains, over the Ana
tolian railroad and its Bagdad con
nections, would require about forty
eight hours for military trains, i At
Bosantf the old pass, road, through
the Cilician Gate, to "Tafus would be
used. The rvad .was ;hen being im
proved by thousands of Armenians
who had been drafted into the Otto
man army for this purpose, and
whose work was being directed by
Turkish. German and Austrian engin
eer officers. Motor trucks could
make the trip from Bosanti to Tarsus
In from six to eight hours, especially,
if, as is asserted, they will be assisted
up the steeper grades, of which there
are three.
In June the tunnels of the Bagdad ,
railroad near Entilly and Karababa. 1
and a large bridge near Rodjo. had
not been rompleted. The railroad
facilities from Tarsus, on the Mersine,
Tarsus and Adana line, ended for this
reason at Osmanie and later at Mam-!
ori points in the Amanus Mountains.
But an excellent road connected these!
places with the terminus of the Bag-j
dad railroad at Rodjo. Heavy traffic j
might find traversing the Giaur Dash
Pass at Entilly. a severe strain but
no. insurmountable obstacle. The:
same is true of the pass near Rodjo. i
From Rodjo the railroad runs to
Aleppo, then over the Hama and Horns
Extension to Ryack. Here a narrow-1
gauge to Damascus would necessitate'
transshipping. At Damascus the Hed-j
Jas railroad begins. It would serve
the expedition as 'far as Maan. Arabia.;
6t some point directly east of Jeru
salem. At the latter point the rail
road through the Hebron valley is

Bonds of Restraint Against
Public Discussion of Inter
national Questions Loosen
ed in Senate.
NO PARTY DIVISION
IN THE ARGUMENT
Works Declares U. S. is Parti
cipating in War By Sale of
Munitions. Lodge Claims
Embargo Unneutral
WASHINGTON. Jan. 5. The bonds
of restraint against public discussion
of the International Relations of the
United States, incident to the Europ
ean war, were brokea in the Senate.
A debate on the government neutrali
ty policy, the exports of war muni
tions and travel by American citizens
on belligerent-owned ship enlivened
the session for more than an hour.
There was no division along party
lines.
Senator Jones, a Republicau, de
nounced as "unpatriotic" those Ame
ricans who imperiled the nation by
taking passage on belligerent vessels.
Senator Works, a Republican, assert
ed the government was "hypocritical
ly" claiming neutrality when it j
fact was participating in the war
through the sale of muwioas. Loupe,
the ranking Republican member of
the foreign relations committee, de
clared 'he placing of an oniba'go oi
arms would now be worth more to
Germany than a million me i and that
it would be "grossly unneutral", and
in fact would make the United States
an ally of Germany. O'Gorman and
Hitchcock urged the advisability if s
munitions embargo. O'Gorman said
that Consul McNeely. the Persia
victim, had disregarded the advice of
the American Consul General Skinner
at London, that he go to Aden aboard
a Dutch vessel. Senator Stone,
chairman of the foreign relations com
mittee, said the debate was out of
order and moved an executive session,
ending it.
Stone said he did not object for a
time, but "thought it well to let It
run awhile by way of feeling out and
getting an index to the Senate." Th
discussion was precipitated by Jones
reading a newspaper editorial ureing
Americans to avoid belligerent ships,
and advising the Preiident to proceej
slowly in the present crisis, heeding
the interest of 99.0rtO.0O0 rather than
a "thousand reckless, uncocsiderate
and unpatriotic citizens who insisted
on traveling in belligerent ships."
Works blazed the way for a "enr
al debate on the position of the United
States in the war by declaring the
American government was no' neu
tral. Asserting at the outset the gov
ernment shared the responsibility tor
the deaths of Americans on the Lust
tania. Works said the "government
knew the Lusitania was loaded to the
guards with munitions and explosives.
Passengers were permitted to travel
on the vessel despite this."
"When Works declared the United
States was actually participating in
the war by the sale of munition.
Reed interrupted to ask: "Ives the
senator know the first loan placed in
the United States, during th war.
was for $25,000,000 to Germany, and
that it was made witho-it a protest
from Works or any other citizen?
Does the senator k"vw Germany pro
cured arms in the United States so
long as possible?"
Works renlied: "That may be true,
but it doesn't alter the situation."
