FIFTH HUSBAND DIVORCES HER
CAN YOU BEAT IT?
NO YOU CANNOT!
The city today began hajiling away the
snow that fell several days ago.
Great wagons heaped with soppy, melting loads
wended across the business district and, much diminish
ed, were dumped "somewhere in Washington" to com
plete their transportation into beautiful little rivulets.
How thoughtful of the city dads to start transporting our seven-inch
blanket! How doubly thoughtful today just as Old Sol had begun struggling
with the task.
Nature works in such peculiar ways. She doesn't clean off neat, little
bare spots, as does our street department. Nor does she heap up carefully
rounderTpiles. Nor load, nor haul it. She just melts it. She works uncon
ventionally.
But our street department, you may rest assured, good citizens, has come
r nobly to nature's assistance. Our snow—every bit of it—will be ceremon
iously carted away to its final resting place, even if it takes until next Sep
tember.
We don't know just how much the city spent today on snow hauling,
probably quite a sum. But, of course, that snow had to be moved, regardless
of cost and economy.
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT
YOU FAIR MAIDS, BUT-
Girls, there has been a grave
and terrible mistake.
To avoid the possible embar
rassment of several married men
who were accused of being bach
elors, we wish to rectify, retract
and remove the bllßiful Blur of
freedom which was pinned on the
unfortunate townsmen.
Henry Hewitt and Capt. Hart
well Palmer are tbe injured ones.
Harry, who is Hen's brother, will
he substituted for Henry on the
list of bachelors, while Capt. will
be scratched. He has a home and
family.
Possibly there are others. If
■o, they have not denied the al
legation.
Attorney Ralph Woods up and
lay* as follow*, in a letter an
nouncing his candidacy in tbe
1916 race:
"Slip me the names of the dar

are bated for minnows and not
whale*, I shall bite." Will the
two TACOMA MAIDS please
write?
Other batches whose pedigrees
have been asked for by unknown

people in Tacoma, be

Readiness for the

LIQUOR
HEARING
BEGINS
From appearance of the federal
court today, nearly all saloon
proprietors and bartenders of Ta
coma evidently took advantage of
their vacation to hear the legal
battle ln the 11th hour attack
made by the Seattle Brewing &
Malting Co. against the prohibi
tion law. .
They crowded the court room
and preserved the appearance of
thoroughly understanding the
high sounding legal phrases
which the attorneys for the brew
ery and Attorney General Tanner
flung at each other in rapid suc
cession.
Swat* Technicalities.
The list of technicalities which
the state supreme court swept
aside when it upheld the dry law
in tbe Gottstein case, and which
were presented again today by
Attorney Jameß Howe, were again
disposed of in short order by Cir
cuit Judge Gilbert, who with
Federal Judges Cuehman and
Rudkin, heard the case.
He declared it the firm rule of
the federal court to follow the de
cision of the state supreme court
on technical questions of the'va
lielitv of the law which affect the
state alone. This rule, hi said,
will be followed ln this case.
The only questions which were
left to argue were whether the
law deprives the brewing com
pany of It* property without due
process of law, whether the brew
ery has the right to manufacture
beer to be shipped outside the
•tate, and whether the state has
the right to prosecute the brew
ery for keeping ln Its poiaasion
beer manufactured before the law
went into operation.
Wants Injunction.
The brewery I* seeking an In
junction to prevent the attorney
general from enforcing the law
and requiring the exportation or
destruction of beer said to be
worth $50,000 now ln the Seattle
company's plant before Jan. 11.
Attorney General Tanner argu

the state breweries alnce they

Robt. Minor writes,from tlie war zone: "One of the most tragic scenes of tlie war. In the hurry and
confusion of a dressing istatioh, a medical officer stops, leans over a foot-wound, and turns away with
the verdict —'self-inHi2i«dr It means that the poor devil has been so erased and worn by constant
trench service that he has turned his rifle on himself as a means of escape from the inferno. It also
means—that he is to be carried away on his stretcher somewhere and—that he will face the firing squad
at sunrise."
Beware
Now of
Grippe
With the snow beginning to
melt, TacoiiiaiiK are In more *a.
rious danger today of catching
colds or the grip, than at any
time this winter. City Health
Officer Wall today tasufed a warn
ing against wet feet or exposure
to the weather. _
"Now is the most dangerous
part of the winter," declared Dr;
Wall. "It Is almost impossible
to prevent one's feet from get
ting wet ln the slush. If wet feet
are not given prompt attention
they will bring on sickness that
may prove, serious. People
should exercise more care right
now than at any time of the
year."
Telegraphic report* today show
that r>7 death* occurred in Cleve
land from grip ln three days, and
there are 16,000 cases today la
Dallas, Texas.
MAYOR BACK
For the first time ln three
week* Mayor Fawcett appeared
at his office today. The mayor
has suffered a severe attack of
grip and bronchial pneumonia. "I
simply couldn't stay cooped up In
my bedroom another minute,"
said ha.
have the right to go outside th*
*tat« just as much a* any outside
firm. On the other hand, that
outside firm* are not allowed to
manufacture any liquor In lh«
etata.
Two Kinds
Apparently there is no use in berating the present
■park-rboard for its inactivity; it simply.has not the
capability to do things in the modern way, and it is
only a waste of time to find fault.
«Hu\vever, it certainly is appropriate to point out
what* a 20th century park board would do, so that
wlfcb the. time comes to elect new members we all
will be alive enough to the situation to turn out and
vote forjcandidates of the do-something kind.
A live park board would have taken advantage
of the unusual snowfall and cold snap, and capi
talized it as a recreation feature of the first mag
nitude.
It would have flooded tennis courts and other
suitable level areas for skating rinks, and have
sprinkled and cared for and patrolled designated
hillsides for coasters. Other cities do these
things.
-The Metropolitan park district has men, splendid
sites for such enterprises and water. Money is not
needed.
Hundreds would have enjoyed the unusual oppor
tunity for winter sports and have benefited.
The "difference between a park organization which
is on the alert to furnish wholesome, healthful recre
ation for its people and one which never so much as
thinks on the subject is the difference between 1716
and 191 ft.
WEATHER
Tacoma: Rain tonight and fri
day.
Washington: Rain west, rain or
snow and warmer east portion.
FLOOD
DANGER
IS LESS
With the temperature rising
gradually in the face of a south
west breeze, the weather man
said today there la less possibil
ity for a flood of the proportion*
that were feared two days ago.
Chinook hasn't appeared on the
scene, and though tlie wind ha*
shifted from the northeast, the
raise ln the thermometer has not
been sudden enough for the snow
eater to get frantically busy on
tbe hills and send down torrent*
to overrun the river valley.
It I* probable Puyallup valley
will experience a flood of more
or less proportion* ln any case.
The *un has been warm
enough, however, to turn the
snow-covered street* and side
walks Into foot-wetting Blush,
though it hasn't had the nerve
to spoil all the skating and coast
ing fun.
By 10:30 this morning the
thermometer had risen to 38 de
grees and waa still climbing. The
warm wave hit the elty about
midnight and ln the early.hours
about an Inch of snow, mixed
with a little rain, fell. Tbe low
eat temperature last night was
26 degrees.

Ea-elei-day.
Durham said he deeded a con
siderable amount of his property
to her just to get her to leave him
because of her cruelty. "She came
to me well recommended," said
Durham, "but that waa before I
learned of her past. Gradually I
ran across different ones of her
husbands. One who la living in
Tacoma at present paid 95,000
for his experience.
"I wanted to work, and she

Sever»»l applicant* have in
quired about tho sale of alcohol
and liquor by drug stores. Deputy
Prosecutor Cramer decided today
that It was lesal to sell an unlim
ited amount of alcohol, provid
ing It was to_ be used fur chemi
cal purposes, and that the permit
should be issued to the sender.
There is some doubt yet about
whisky and other liquor*.
Several cases Of delirium tre

Only 14 liquor license* have
been issued by the county thus
