Very Rich Strike.
The Redeagle Mining Com
pany, composed of Dr. Boswell,
Ed. Miller, Joe Bingnam ana
Less Allen, and working on the
George Redeagle land, five miles
south of this city, made a very
rich strike of both lead and zinc
a few days ago. In sinking the
shaft into the ore body a car load
of lead ore was taken out, and
beneath the lead is 24 feet of
verv rich sine dirt.
The ground was drilled before
the shaft was sunk, and ore was
found by the drill at 49 feet.
The shaft was sunk about 40
feet from the drill hole.
Mr. Miller, who is superinten
dent for the company, tells us it
is the biggest and nchest strike
he has seen in the field south of
Baxter.
Lucky Ike.
About three or four years ago
W. I. Bingham of Quapaw pur
chased 80 acres of grass land.
He bought it for farm prices,
mind you, and today it is worth
hundreds of dollars per acre.
About a year ago the Picher
Lead Company leased a lot of
land adjoining Ike's purchase and
began a drilling campaign. They
made some awfully big strikes,
and a town started on the
strength of their finds. The
Picher people put up a mill, and
then another one, and now they
are working on a third one.
They say they will build seven
mills before they get through.
And one of the mills is going up
on Ike's land. A shaft is being
pushed down to the ore body,
which is very rich, and it will
not be very long until Ike will be
drawing big royalties. And
mind you, he did not give tbe
Picher people an ordinary lease,
either. They gave him a cash
bonus of $2,000 for a lease on hit
eighty, and besides they are to
pay him a royalty of eigbt per
cent.
It iust comes his way. If he
was to fall in a sewer he would
come out with a new suit of
clothes on and smelling like a
rose.

Many Running.
Most of the mines in the camp
south of town are running and
making good turn-ins.
The Anchor, Lincolnville, Mo
hawk and Redeagle are all mak
ing good outputs of ore every
day, and the Mission and n-aty,

The activity on every hand is
very marked.

WEAXE AKEHSEIOF THE
Better Yet
You hear it said of some men that their word is as
good as their bond, and it's a fine thing to say of any man.
But did you ever stop to think that no matter how
good your word may be. there is something better? If
you owe a bill at the store and pay it in cash and the
merchant tries to collect the amount again, your word
might be good that you had paid it. But suppose you
had an account at the bank and paid by check. The can
celled check would speak louded than your own word, no
matter how good your reputation. No getting around
that It pays to pay by check.
