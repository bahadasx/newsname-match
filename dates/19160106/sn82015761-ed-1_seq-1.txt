E- S. Price, alias Jas. Williams,
Wanted in, Many States on
Many Charges Supposed
Wife, Kidnapped Minor
E. S. Price, who came to Will
iams under the assumed name of
Jas. Williams, several weeks ago
is now behind the bars. He is
wanted in several different states
on several different charges. The
young girl whom he brought
with him as his wife and who
still thought herself his wife
even after his arrest, is wanted
by heart broken parents who
beg her to return home.
A3 Mr. James Williams, Mr.
Price posed as a man of wealth,
who had come to Williams to buy
a large number of horses. Strang
ly for a man of wealth, his purse
was empty. This he explained
by the story that while he was
in fact burdened with riches, all
his wealth was in Florida await
ing his call and he hesitated to
telegraph this call for the reason
that he did not want the parents
of his wife to locate him till aft
er the first of January. His rea
son for this was that his wife
was but seventeen when he mar
ried her and her folks had ob
jected. After January first she
would be of marriagable age,
eighteen and her parents could
then no longer exercise authori
ty over her. His lies were be
lieved by many to the extent of
extending him considerable cred
it. His chauffeur, Ross Towery,
proved particularly unfortunate.
Mr. Towery 's home is in Los
Angeles. He owns a number
of automobiles and makes a pra
tice of renting them out. Hs
rented one to Mr. Williams for a
trip to Arizona and went along
to drive . it. The consideration
was to be several hundred dol
lars. The venture proved a
dead loss to Mr. Towery.
Mr. Williams' cattle story did
not ring true to Bobby the Cop
and he kept his eye on the man.
None of the horse deals went
for want of money on the part
of the buyer and soon his story
began to be doubted generally.
When at last Justice Twitty re
ceived a telegram asking for the
man's arrest on a grand larceny
charge, Bobby Burns was im
mediately notified and Price -was
immediately placed behind the
bars. His tearful companion
begged to be locked up with him
but was sent back to her room
instead. The arrest was made
last Sunday and that night the
prisoner was taken to the jail at
Flagstaff.
Later it developed that the
marriage license which the coup
le earned bore no stamp. It was
issued at Hoboken N. J. and ap
peared to be a hoax.
Once the location of Mr. Price
was made known in the east,
his fame or better, notoriety
began to be told. It was a busy
time for the call boys.
The girl's name was Lillian
King. Her home was in Mayo.
Florida. Her parents and friends
" begged her to return to their
loving protection as she had
been enticed away from home
thru her ignorance.
One telegram stated that Price
has a living wife in Riceville Geor
gia. It developed that a number
of Sheriffs were looking for this
man. According to the last re
ports, the Sheriff from Florida
will be the one to accompany Mr.
Price, alias Williams, alias James
back to his eagerly awaiting
friends. It looks bad for him
grand larceny, kidnapping, big
amy, and finally Uncle Sam may
want him for White Slaving.
ADOPTS OWN DAUGHTER
AFTER FOURTEEN YEARS
Judge Perkins, of the Superior
Court of Coconino County was
called to act upon a very unusual
case Thursday of last week.
F. M. Gold representing Mr. and
Mrs. Riemer of this place, asked
that Mr. and Mrs. Riemer be al
lowed to adopt Mrs. Riemer's
own daughter, Miss Nellie Nor
ene Smith, of Colorado. The
court granted the adoption and
Mis3 Smith became the happy
daughter of the Riemer home.
Of course Mrs. Riemer was de
lighted to have her own daught
er back again, and as for Gus,
who has been the happiest man
in town since his marriage to
Mrs. Riemer, the truth seemed
too good to believe.
A little over fourteen years
ago, Mrs. Eva Bond, now Mrs.
Riemer. was left with several
children to provide for. The
burden was heavy for her, espec
ially because of the baby, Nellie,
only a year old. Two kind friends
a Mr. and Mrs. Smith, who had
no children of their own, offered
to adopt the baby. Mrs. Bond
realizing that would mean a bet
ter home for Nellie than she her
self could offer agreed to this,
and the baby became a Smith.
Mrs. Bond became a trained
nurse and worked at her pro
fession until the time of her
marriage to Mr. Riemer last
spring. With a cozy home of
her own and with a kind
husband amply able to support
both herself and her daughter,
Mrs. Riemer began to long to
have her baby, now a girl of
sixteen, back again. Last sum
mer Miss Nellie paid a visit to the
Riemer home. Mr. Riemer be
came as anxious as Mrs. Riemer
to have her stay with them for
good.
In, the meantime, during the
fourteen years since Mrs. Bonds
baby became a Smith, the Stork
paid several visits to the Smith
home. This was still a good
home for Nellie but when Mr.
and Mrs. Remier asked to
re-adopt her for their own home,
the Smiths comforted by child
ren of their own, felt that it
would oe Dest to let JNellie go
back to her own mother to make
her happy, and gave her con
sent, ine court action com
pleted the arrangement, and now
Mr. and Mrs. Riemer boast of
the happiest home in town.

tion. Mr. Gilson moved to Oat

ed great satisfaction with the

bur. HEAVY SNOW WRECKS
BARSITT-POLSON GARAGE
The heavy snow which fell here
last week wrecked the larger part
of Babbitt-Poison Co's. garage.
The north wall was forced out and
the north part of the roof was
crushed to the ground, by the
weight of the accumulated snow
on the roof. The accident occured
between six and seven o'clock Fri
day evening. No one was in the
building at the time.
A number of cars stored in the
garage were completely hidden by
: e wreckage, but they suffered
r narkably little damage.
'aumann & Hinds were set to
wc k on the wreck, Saturday, and
no v Babbitts have a garage, again,
but is an abbreviated one. The
nortn wall was moved in to the
part of the roof left standing, and
the building was shortened to that
extent. This is but a temporary
makeshift Babbitt's plan to re
place the old building with a fine
new one that will be a great credit
to the town.
Ash Fork was well represent
ed at the New Year's dance by
Miss Lewis, Miss Glady's Dick

Farewell Dinner Party
Mrs. DeBold, of the Fray Marcos
was hostess to a very pretty holi
day function, a farewell dinner
for Miss Edna Buggeln, who left
the following day to pass the re
mainder of the winter in Los Angeles.
Covers were laid for fifteen
The ladies were in full evening
apparel, especially noticeable was
the gown of the hostess, a black
charmeuse with an overdress of
chiffon embroidered in silver. A
bingle red, red rose at the . corsage
was the only ornament. Ihe
guest of honor wore a girlish gown
of white crepe de chine but with
little garniture a bouquet of pink
sweet peas completed the toilet.
The dining room was hung with
ropes of smilax, relieved by bunch
es of pink carnations.
The table decorations carried out
this delicate color scheme. Upon
a rich lace centerpiece stood a vase,
of rare beauty and value, holding
an exquisite collection of carna
tions. Ribbon streamers of pink
and white ran fiom this center to
each guest's plate. At the end of
the streamers were tied for the
ladies bouquets of pink sweet peas
and for the men buttonairs of

gaged in "500". Miss Keating
was the fortunate prize winner a
dainty sugar bowl and creamer.
Mr. Kimball won the pocket flash
light which will assist him greatly
in finding the key hole to his
bachelor apartments.
At a late hour the guests depart
ed voting Mrs. DeBold a most de
lightful hostess.
Watch Party
Last Friday evening the 500
Clab entertained . with a watch
party at the Parish House. A
quiet evening was spent until
the stroke of twelve when bed
lam suddenly let loose. It devel
oped that each member of the
party was armed with some form
of instrument of auditory torture
and each forthwith played upon
his or her instrument, with all
the vehemence that may be stor
ed within one individual. The
conglomerate sum of the. noise
awoke the neighborhood to the
fact that . the New Year was
born. After this infant had
been fittingly ushered in, a few
participated in impromptu danc
ing, to music supplied by Mr.
Coleman and Mrs. Nordyke.
Farewell Party
The Ladies of the Maccabees
gave a farewell party in honor
of Miss Margarette Dermont, at
the Opera House Wednesday
night. The hall was decorated
in keeping with the holiday sea

BOUND OVER TO
SUPERIOR COURT
Willis Azbill and his brother
Henry, were both given a hearing
before Justice of the Peace, Twitty,
here this week and both were
bound over to the Superior Court,
without bond. -The evidence
against Willis is much stronger
than that against his brother. He'
was taken into custody' with the
suit case and some clothes belong
ing to the murdered man in his
possession.
Those who were present at the
hearing given Willis state that
when a revolver which had belong
ed to the murdered man and
which he had sold to an Indian,
was suddenly placed before his
eyes together with the axe, with
which the killing was done, he'
nearly fainted and asked for a
drink of water. .
The story offered by Willis in
explanation of his having the boy's
property in his possession, was as
follows: "Henry Thomas left
camp one day, carrying three quilts
suit case, a Winchester rifle and a
six shooter, to walk to Prescott.
They intended going in with all of
the goods, but were forced to wait
on account of a sick burro. " He
did not know what had become of
the boy. The suitcase which he
had in his possession and which
Mr. Thomas, the father, identified
as belonging to . his son, together
with the clothes it contained, he
claimed belonged to him and that
he had bought them in Idaho."
The cases against the two broth
ers will be tried before the next
session of the Superior Court at
Flagstaff.
Chas. Wade has been transferred
to the meat department at Babbitt's
to fill the vacancy made by the de
parture of Carl Folk. Mr. Mathews,
of Los Angeles, will fill Mr. Wade's
place in the grocery department.
Aphold Makes Rich Strike
Henry Aphold shipped ninety
five sacks of rich gold ore from
his mining claims down at Ajo to
the El Paso smelter and has good
reasons to believe from previous
assays that he will net a good
sum from the shipment. The
work done by him in a short
time while down there has con
vinced him that his claims are
rich in the yellow metal. The
Ajo district he is certain will be
one of the biggest mining cent
ers in the state soon, as any
quantity of low grade copper ore
is now in sight. Sun
To Tour Southern California
Messrs Martin Buggeln and F. O.
Poison shipped their cars to the
Needles the first of the week. From
there, Mr. Poison and son, Earle,
and Mr. Buggeln accompanied by
Mrs. Buggeln and Miss Edna, will
motor to the coast. The Buggeln 'a
will spend the remainder of the
winter in California. Mr. Poison
will visit with his family at Whit
tier for a few weeks and Earle will
probably take a short course in a
mechanical school, specializing on
the automobile.
Wm. McCoy Seriously 111
Wm. McCoy was taken to Needles
today by trained nurse, Mrs. Rein
hardt. He is suffering from a ser
ious attack of illness that threatens
to go into pneumonia and necessi-.
tated his immediate removal from,
the mountain.
Mr. and Mrs. F. O; Seaward are
the proud parents of a fine new ba
by boy who arrived just forty-five
minutes too late to be a New Year's
gift.
