A Weekly Keview
Of The Great War
The eity of Salonica, the ancient
Thessalonl?a to which the
1'auliae epistles were directed,
in now the chief objective in the
Great War. It has long been a
bone of contention among the
Balkan states and the cause of
more tnaa one war. Greece,
Serbia, Bulgaria ami Austria intrigued
and struggled for its possession
when Turkey should relinquish
it because it is the most
important port on tho Aegean
and the natural outlet of the
richest agricultural region in the
vicinity and of the oountries to
the north. When the Balkan
coalition of Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria
and Montenegro attacked
Turkey, the Bulgars and the
Greeks raced for Salonica, but
the Greeks got there first and
obtained posession. Then the
'disappointed Bulgars attacked
the Greeks in the hope of gain
ing either Salomca or the port of
Kavaia to the east of it, but in
this second Balkan war Bulgaria
was defeated by her late allies,
t he Greeks and Serbs. But the
Serbs wore by no means satisfied
with the resultR, for they
had tailed to obtain by their two
wars their great desire, a port
on either the Aegean or Adri
nf in
The policy of the Austro-Hungarian
empire has for more than
fifty yeais been directed toward
securing a trade route through
Serbia to the sea at Saloniea. It
'was this ambition which brought
about the conllict. between Austriu-llangary
and Serhia and so
p.-eci pi rated the GreitWar a year
ago last July. Twice the Austro-Hur.garian
troops tried to
force their way down through
Serbia and failed. The third
time they succeeded with the
help of the Germans and Bulgurs
and the armies of these
four nations now stand on the
Greek frontier, only thirty-five
miles north of Saloniea. But
between thorn and the desired
haven are the lines being forti
fied by the French and British.
The first, iine of defense is established
on the hills close about
the p<?rt; the second front, a larger
semi-circle of about twentyfive
miles radius. The Greek
troops have been withdrawn
[from the prospective battlefield

The delay of the Central Powers
in crossing the Greek fronj
tier, whether due to the reces
sity of gathering a larger force
lortothe fear of offending the
Greeks, is at any rate giving the
Allies the time they needed to
'prepare for the defense ( f Salon
lica. The French and British
troops already there "are said t >

! twice the population of the city,
and more are arriving every day.

This is very heavy, considering
the size of tho force,

about 20,000 men.
It is expected that Teheran,
the capital, will soon be occupied
by the Russian forces whc
are now fighting the Turks and
Persians only twelve milee
away. The capture of Ramadan
brings them within about
220 miles of Kut - el - Amara,

Firms, who has been for most
among the Persians favoring the
Russian side, has now been
made premier and virtual ruler
of the country, since the Shah is
only seventeen years old. This

i8fied with things as they are is
often the worst kind of sin. If
the people of our town could see
clearly what our town is now,
and put that in contrast with
what it would be if all our citiz

the town it ought to be and
might become, they would weep
over it as Jesus did over Jerusalem.
It would seem that the time
is ripe for the churches of our

churches should keep to the

should be a sort of John

There is coming to Chesterfield
a Booster Chautauqua in the
near future that will furnish uf
an opportunity to begin to do
some of these great thing for
our town. 'I he first is to get together
and make it a great success.
We can do this by a united
and enthusiastic effort. We
can discover men and women
among us who have the gift ot
leadership, we can discover our
ability to cooperate on a matter
of community welfare. If we
will do this it will be worth ten
times what it will cost us and it
may be the beginning of great

May we measure up to this opportunity

Board's Right to Pay
Accountant Disputed
Editor The Advertiser: I
have been requested to make
public my views of the law in
regard to the accountant now
employed in checking the books
of the County officials.
First I wish to cite section
4034 of Volume 1 Code of 1912
in full:
"Grand Jury May Employ
Expert Accountant. Grand ju
ries may, whenever in their
judgment it becomes npc.(>9fl*rr
employ one or more expert accountants
to aid them to exatnimine
and investigate the offices,
books. papers, vouchers and accounts
of any public officer of
their respecti e counties and to
fix the amount of compensation
pr per diem to be paid therefor,
upon the approval of the presid
ing judge, given before any expert
is employed."
Under this section it will be
seen that a necessary prerequisite
is the approval of the presiding
judge before the expert
is employed. Such accountant
when employed is engaed in the
work that is supposed to be done
oy the grand jury and for this
reason should be pai as the
grand jurors are paid viz upon
warrant signed by the Circuit
Judge. In my opinion the
County Board of Commissioners
only have such powers to pass
upon claims as given by section
045 which section is as to accounts
etc in re roads, bridges,
ferries; 070 which lays down
specifically the only items that
are to be pai 1 by the county and
unless this accountant under the
provision of this section comes
in ks a juror there is no nrovi-i
ion made for the payment and
therefore the statute fails.

Justice Lamar Dead
Joseph llucker I.amar, associate
justice of the supreme court
of the United States, died at his
home in Washington January 21,
after an illness of several months,
lie was 08 years of age and had
been on the supreme bench five
years. .
The immediate cause of death
was graciual failure, hastened by
intlamation of one of the lungs
which had threatened to develop
into pneumonia. Attending physicians
declared, however, that
the primary cause was overwork
due to the arduous duties of a
member of the supreme court
and as commissioner of the United
States in 1(511 to the mediation
conference between the
United S'tates and Mexico at Niagra
halls.
Exhausted by last year's term
of court, Justice Lamar went to
White Sulphur, W. Va , in
June. lie improved until Sep
tember when a clot in an artery
caused him to lose the use for a
time of his left arm and l^g It
was some time before he recoved
from this attack, but when
he returned to Washington in
October he planned to return to
his work on the bench in February.
About a week ago the justice
contracted a cold. His weakened
heart was unable to bear the
added burden of this intlamatson.

Teutonic Outrage 1
Rills North Carolinian
Just as it seemed that Austria
had repented her recent outrage
in the Mediterranean Sea, the
sinking without warning of the
passenger ship, Ancona, news
reaches our shores of two fresh
and v^ry similar offences. Without
warning, and as in other
cases, in plain violation of international
law, two more passenger
vessels were neni to the bottom.
They are the Persia and
the Glengyle.
The sinkingof the Persia brings
Austria's crimnality close to
home, for hv this ?#?t oho toot
the life of llobext Ney McNee- _
ley, of Monroe, N. C. Mr. McNeeley
was well known in this
comity. His many friends are
shocked to learn of his death.
Mr. McNeely had left Monroe
in October for Washington,
where he went for a month's
special study in the State Department
preparatory to taking
up his duties at Aden, Arabia,
where he had previously been appointed
consul. He sailed from
New York to London on November
27th, and spent some time
in London before embarking for
his post. At the lime he sailed
there was an unusal activity of
submarines in the Mediterranean
and the American consul at
London advised him to take another
route, but he had already
engaged passage 011 the Persia.
.\ir. ivici'seeiy naa no i^ar ol the
war infested sea, and oftec jestabout
the matter.
The fact that Mr. McNeely is v
the second American consul to
lose his life in this way has given
the case an unusual sensation.
1 lis name has appeared in the
last few (lays in every large daily
p>pir in the world. The North
Carolina newspapers, to whom
he was known, have been very
war n and sympathetic in their
comments.
Dispatches from Cairo state
that the Persia was struck without
warning and sank in five
minutes with a loss of probably
300 lives: Betwoen loO and 100
survivors were landed at Alexandria,
Egypt.
