I am a pestilence
Sweeping the world
Hate is the root of me,
Death is the fruit of me,
Swift is my stroke;
Blood is the sign of me,
Steel is the twine of me,
Thus shall ye know me:
I am the death o life,
I am the life of death,
I amwar!
I am madness
Riding the necks of men
Champing of nations tarmed,
Stamping of warhorse hoofs
Charged unbridled;
Clashing of bayonets,
Flashing of sword blades,
Rumbling of cannon wheels,
Crumbling of kingdoms,
These are my harbingers:
I am the death of law,
I am the law of death,
I am war!
