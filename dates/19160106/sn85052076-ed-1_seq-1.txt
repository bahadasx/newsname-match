Use Your Head Piece!
The beginning of a New Year comes at a time
when people can do some thinking if they will.
And every one has things that need to be studied
over. Experience does us no good unless we remember
it and think it over, and imformation does us no good
unless we remember and think about that! But we are
each one the king in a little circle, and the judge and
the commanding general !
Shall I plan to move to a new place? Shall I
form a partnership, or get married ? Shall I follow farm
ing, or learn a trade ? These are big questions and ought
to have good thought.
And there is another set of questions only less im
portant. Shall I send my child to school ? Shall I vote
for John Smith ? Shall I change the plan of crops on the
farm ?
And then there are the How Questions. How
shall I help my wife or husband better? How shall I in
terest my children in good things? How shall I encour
age my neighbors to improve? How shall I keep my
work up tatter? How shall I keep well?
The erson who neglects all these questions will
come to trouble, or else be cared for like a child by other
people. The people who prosper and help others are
eop!e who sit down and think. The beginning weeks
of the New Year are a good time to do some thinking,
t'se your headpiece !
Scrap Books and Note Books.
Many wise and successful people keep journals or
diaries, that is Itooks in which they write down something
every day.
A ship on the ocean keeps a daily record of its
pf ogress, the weather, and the things that happen. If
you amount to anything you are as imjortant as a ship,
and will be well repaid if you write down every night the
chief things that have happened to you, and the chief
things that you have done during the day. Such daily
records are of great value for reference in later years, and
a great source of pleasure.
And when you write down the happenings of the
day you will be almost sure to have imortant thoughts,
and some of these should be written down also.
. An l next in imortance to daily records and note
books are scrap-taoks in which you file away the good
things that you find in the Citizen. The person who has
a scrap book soon becomes an important person. He
has a place in the scrap-book for good songs and poems.

Estill Oil fteld Nsws.
There are now fifty-two produc

are eleven sets of tools running. The
pipe line is in operation. In order
to get the heavy oil to flow through
the pipes readily it has been sub
jected to a steaming process. Most
of the operators have been off on
their holiday vacation and thus sus
pended the operations temporarily.
A twenty barrel well was drilled on

Kentucky Oil Fields Are Booming.
Kentucky is destined to surpass all
other States ill the production of
high-grade lubricating oils, as stat
ed by E. C. Disci, president and gen
eral manager of the Disci Oil and
Gas Company, of Williamsburg, who
has plans to sink several additional
wells during the coming spring and
summer. The development of these
llelds in the past few years has been
far more satisfactory than was the
rase in Pennsylvania, Ohia, Indiana
or West Virginia in the same length
of time.
Gov. Arthur Yeager of Porto
Rico, well known a former profes
sor at Georgetown, Ky is back at
Washington for a brief vacation.
State Legislature Begins
The lOIrt session of the General
Assembly began January 4th, both
houses being called to order and op
ened by prayer.
The Republicans took a good na-
t u red altitude, promising to sup
port whatever measures are for the
public goo, I and interpose no fac
tious opposition. The unfair laws
by which the state is districted
make it impossible for the Republi
cans to have their fair share of rep
resentation in the State Legislature.
H. M. Rrock. of Harlan County,
well known in Rerea, was the Re
publican Caucus nominee for Presi
dent of the Senate, nnd A. J. Oliver
of Scottsvillo for Speaker in the
House, and these gentlemen will he
floor leaders for the Republicans.
There are only forty-seven Repub
licans in this Legislature.
The Republican Caucus was at
tended by important leaders Includ

HOPE FOR NEW
UNDERSTANDING
D. S. to Ask Entente Powers
Not to Arm Liners.
DO NOT PREDICT A BREAK
Austrian Official Says His Government
Will Make Full Reparation If It la
Shown That Auatrlan Submarine
8nk the Persia.
Washington, Jan. 4. Although ad
mitting that the conducted submarine
activities In eastern Mediterranean
waters, as evidenced by the reports
of the sinking of the British merohant
vessel Qlengyle and the Japanese
liner Kenkon Maru, may make Im
possible a satisfactory explanation of
the destruction of the liner Persia,
state department officials are hope
ful that out of the situation may
apring a new understanding between
the United States and the Teutonic
allies on the subject of submarine
warfare.
In the same quarters it Is regarded
aa more than probable that In the
near future the United States govern
ment will approach Informally the en
tente powers with a view to getting
them to agree henceforth to permit
no guns to be mounted on passenger
liners.
The purpose of both moves, now un
der consideration, say responsible of
ficials. Is to safeguard the Uvea of
American citlzena who may be com
pelled to take passage on the high
aeas on merchant ships flying the flag
of belligerent nations. If this end Is
attained, it is said the sinking of the
Persia, tragic aa it waa in the enorm
ous toll of human life, may after all.
prove a blessing In disguise.
President Wilson returned to Wash
ington od a special train from Hot
Springs, Va., where he has been
spending his honeymoon. He has
taken charge of the entire situation.
Immediately after bis arrival he con
ferred with Secretary Lansing. It la
also probable that he will discuss the
situation with Chairman Stone, of
the senate committee of foreign rela
tions. It Is likely also thst when con
gress reconvenes there will be a gen
eral airing of views on the floors of
both houses and senate.
At the Austrian and German em
bassies the prediction was confident
ly made that the sinking of the Persia
will not lead to a break. Neither at
the emliasaies, nor at the atate de
partment has confirmation been re
ceived of the reported sinking of the
British freighter Glengyle, nor of the
Jspanese liner Kenkon Maru. Unless
Americans were on board these two

RUSS ATTACK
IN FULL SWING
Two Huge Armies Grapple In
Galicia,
MANIA'S AID THE PRIZE
Czs'S Troops Apparently Making
low But Steady Gaina Over the
Teutons Fighting Began Nearly a
Week Ago, Remains .Undecided.
London, Jan. 4. The Oaltclan
crown land, Bukowina, the province
of Volyhinia, and the western part of
Bessarabia, constitute the battle
ground of violent fighting between two
huge armies, Russian and Auatro
German, which began nearly a week
ago and is still in full swing, with the
Russians the attackers and with Rou
manian eventual aid, the prize court
ed by either side.
In the Bukowina the battle centers
upon Czernowits, the capital. Here
the Russians stormed a height and
are apparently making alow but
steady headway. In Volyhinia, a five
day battle has been going on In the
Styr and on the Bug, northward of
Czernowits, north of Rafaelowka and
to the Pripet marshes.
Czarnowltz, on the Kovel Sarny sec
tor, haa been for months bitterly con
tested, but never since the Gallclan
battle In the earlier atagea of the war,
haa the fighting for this point been
so bitter and so protracted as It la
In thla latest struggle, still undecided.
Only by wresting from the Teutons
the two Volhynlan fortresses, Dudue
and lAtzk, will the Russians be able
to undertake a new campaign against
eastern Galicia on a larger scale.
Rovano, the third atrongbold. is In
their hands. The Russian offensive
In Volhyinla, therefore la aimed to
getting the Kovel-Sarny aector of the
Brest Lltovsk Kleff railroad, thus cut
ting off the essential Teuton aupply
line and then driving southward In a
flanking movement against Lutzk and
Dud no.
On the east Gallclan front which,
with the Uesssrablan sector stretch
es close to the Roumanian border, the
battle rages chiefly southward of Par
nopol, on the middle and upper Styr
pa, the bridgehead of Burkonow and
further beyond Czernowits to Buezao.
Here the Russiana are endeavoring to
make headway toward Lemberg and
oapture that city. CzaernowlU is
considered by military experts the
key to the Carpathians.
Pro-sllied elements in Roumanta
have replied to the entente represen
tations, urging Roumanian Interven
tion that the time for Roumanla to
Join the allies had passed with the
Teuton offensive, which a year ago
drove the KiiHsians out of the Car
pathian mountain paxses and out of
the greater part of Callrla.
Rouinania has pointed to the men
ace to her border presented by the
presence of large Teuton forces. The
Russians are now believed to be strlv
lug for a new great Gallclan drive
which would necessitate the with
drawal of this Teuton menace, which
would win Roumanla to the allies.
It wss to this end that the Russian
army for months held tn readinesa In
Besssrsbla for a drive at Bulgaria
through Roumanian territory waa
sent to Galicia and Volyhinia. Thla
army Is believed to be well equipped
with ammunition, principally from
Japan.
