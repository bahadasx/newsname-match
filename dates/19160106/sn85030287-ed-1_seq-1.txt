Farm and Home Institute
The farm and home institute
to be held in Meade on January
13 and 14 is easily the most im
portant agricultural meeting of
(the year. It is held in the in
terest of the farm, the home, and
(the community. Perhaps no
business is more difficult to han-
die profitably than farming. No
( business requires more thought
for efficient management, no
business requires more constant
attention and care than high
class farming and few, if any,
businesses are as important te
the welfare of both country and
town alike, as farming.
Everyone in the community,
therefore, will be interested in
the institute which is not only a
vrnnfprpnrp in rpo-ard to aericul-
o
lure but a school in which the
Vnderlying principles of the
lusiness of farming, home mak
jigand community building are
imphasized.
The program is more attrac
fve than ever before. It starts
, 10:15 sharp in the morning
.Vith two lectures from the rep
resentatives oi -the Agricultural
College. Each forenoon and af
ternoon there will be one or
more definite demonstrations to
illustrate the subjects discussed.
The farmers in the state and the i0us 1916
townspeople have invested their;
money in educational institutions .
and are supporting them loyally.
This meeting will bring to the
community some of the profess
ors from one of the larger insti
tutions, the Agricultural College.
Advertise it, invite your neigh
bors, and come yourself. Let
us use what is ours to the fullest
extent.

With this issue of The News
we enter upon our seventeenth
year. On January 11, 100 un
der the management of J. D.
Webrle, now located in Boulder,
Colorado, the first issue was
printed. Since that time many
changes have taken place in our
city, and in every instance they
have been for the betterment
and the up-building of Meade.
The year just closed has been
a very pleasant as well as a very
profitable one to us. We desire
to thank those who have in any
way patronized us, and also to
assure them that the same has
been fully appreciated.
It is the policy of The Ne .o
deal fairly with each and every
one alike, to favor that which
will be of the greatest benefit to
the greatest number, and to as
sist the religious and fraternal
organizations of our city when
ever possible. All this we have
done to the best of our ability,
and if in the judgment of our
readers, we are deserving, we
kindly ask that they give s tbe
boquets, while we live and can
- japprVciate them. Our policy in
tbe year now beginning, will be
the same as in the past. For all
our readers we wish a prosper-
J. T. Helm, the implement
man, will have a machinery dem
onstration next Saturday, Janu

to be demonstrated will be a
Mogul Oil engine, a Lily cream
separator, and a low lift manure
spreader with wide spread at
tachment. An expert w;ll be
here on that date and an oppor
tunity will be afforded any one
interested to see what these ma
chines will do.
Presbyterian
A goodly number greeted Dr.
Irwin on Sabbath evening and
listened intently to his opening
discourse from the words "Be
hold be prayeth." Strength and
eai nestnos characterize tbe
speaker, unpretentious ;n man
ner he vividly presents the im
portance of every day right do
ing.
Monday night ne spoke on
"What shall I do with Jesus?"
Tuesday night "The work of the
Holy Spirit," was presented
creating great interest in a sub
ject too little understood. To
night (Wednesday) "The Ten
Commandments" shall probably
bring a crowded bouse.
Each night this week subjects
of vital importance and of timely
interest will receive earnest at
tention by this master workman.
We appreciate tbe interest
shown by our brothers in the
ministry and by the good people
of tbe other congregations here.
Tbe Methodists dismiss their
prayer meeting and postpone
tbeir quarterly meeting and our
Baptist friends bave been very
helpful also with tbe interest
they bave shown.
Don't forget that tbe Sunday
morning and evening meetings
will be tbe last.

Departed
We are again reminded of the
uncertainty of life in the sudden
departure oi JJr. w. vv. Simp
son, of this city.
In apparently bis usual health,
Dr. Simpson went to bis dental
office this morning, built the fire
and then, for some reaon, step
ped into an adjoining room for
some kindling wood. As he was
passing through bis labaratory,
which is just back of bis office,
he fell, and Roy Taggart, who
entered soon after, discovered
the lifeless body.
Dr. Simpson was an old timer
in Kansas. With his brother,
Dr. O. II. Simpson, he came to
this state in 1885 and opened a
dental office in Dodge City. In
1903 he located in Meade and has
resided here since. He was a
man who always looked on the
bright side of life, and had a
word , of cheer for all he met.
His sudden death is regretted
by the entire community.
He was born in Winches'er
Indiana, June 14, 1859, and de
parted this life January b, 1916.
He was a member of the LO.OK
the Kebekahs, and A. O. U. W.
The funeral services will be
held at the residence of S. 1'.
Bunch, where he made his home,
on Friday morning at 10 o'clock,
conducted by Rev. S. M. Hunt,
of the M. E. church, to which he
belonged, and the remains will
be taken to Dodge City for burial.
He is survived by one sister,
Mrs. Inas Cbisim, of Medford,
Oregon, and one Brother, Dr.
O. H. Simpson, of Dodge City.

Rogers Wins Match
There seems to be some mis
understanding regarding the
wrestling match between Roy
Gillis, of Hutchinson, and Er
nest Rogers, of Plains, which oc
cu red at Phelps theatre in thin
cityi December 29. The facts
are: Rogers took tbe first fall in
thirty-seven minutes, Gillis the
second in four minutes, and
Rogers the third in eleven min
utes. A message, bearing the
name of Roy E. Gillis, was sijnt
to Tbe Hutchinson News giving
the match to him (Gillis) and tbe
same report was given to Tbe
Meade Globe, which accounts
for both reports being the same.
The individual who gave tbe re
port to The Globe afterward ad
mitted that he had reported the
match wronr- Tbe account in
last week's Meade News was
correct. What reason Gillis
had for sending the report in as
he did, or why he wrestled un
der the name of John Mantrez.
we do not know, but one thing is
certain and that is that Ernest

should not have nao it.
The
match was won by Roger

A new industry has sprung
up in Meade county. It is that
of mining and loading silica.
Nine miles north of Meade is a

A number of years ago the
Cudaby Packing Co. purchased
the land upon which it is located.
Last fall work of building a track
from Fowler to the beds, a dis

1915-1916
The year 1915 witnessed much
prosperity for Meade. Many
new homes bave been built and
many have found our city a de
sireable place to live and have
ccsii' to lwcV. aitioag ijs. Ou.
merchants have all enjoyed a
liberal patronage, and our farm
ers have been permitted to bar
vest a bountiful crop. Every
where prosperity is evident
tbe many automobiles, modern
homes, and up-to-date farm ma-
achinery and improvements all
attest it. Nor must we forget
our city improvements. More
and 'better street lights, more
side walk, curb and gutter. Our
places of amusement are among
the best to be found anywhere.
Last, and greatest of all are our
churches and our schools. In
tbe last year a handsome new
school building has been erected
and Meade boasts of one of the
best schools in the state. Each
of tbe five churcbe record a
steady grcwih in membership,
the abi-ity to mal.e improvements
and repa-rs to buildings and to
ground
ari'l n one instance a
fnc nn tr.ilding. Nor is this
a'.. 'Vithin the present year
will come greater advancement.
Another -.v church building,
more new homes, and all else in
due proportion till pointing to
greater, bigger, be:ter Meade.
The City schools opened Mon
day, after a two week's vacation.
Tbe special meetings at tbe
Presbyterian church are pro
gressing nicely and good crowds
are attending. Rev. Walter M.
Irwin, D. D., who is in charge is
a forceful and convincing speak
er and those who have beard him
have complimented his sermons
very highly.
There will be a box supper at
the school bouse in District 33,
better known as tbe Merkle
school, on Saturday night, Janu
ary 15. A good program will be
given before tbe sale of tbe boxes
begins. Miss Ola Granger, the
teacher, extends a cordial invi
tation to all to attend.
