Deliver Sm? c'g Blow
Mile Struck W s J Opponents Had Assembled Strong
est Force Greatest Battle Since Allies Offensive Began
Is Being Fought FreiuA Also Advance Their Lines
Adjoining British
By Ed L. Keen,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
London, July 14. British troops broke the German
line on a four mile front at dawn today with a smashing
blow that swept the British lines into the villages of
Longueval and Bazentin-le-grand, and cleared the Trones
wood, an advance of more than a mile.
- The gain is the greatest scored for the Anglo-French
offensive since the opening of the great assault thirteen
days ago.
"At dawn we attacked the enemy's second system of
defense," said an official bulletin from Genenal Haig,
given out at 11 a. m. "We broke in hostile positions on
a four mile front, capturing several strongly defended
localities. Heavy fighting continues."
1 Special dispatches from press headquarters at the
front announced the capture of , Longval, Basentin-le-grand
and the clearing of the Trones wood in the early
hours of the fighting. The blow was struck at the very
sector of the battle front where the Germans had as
sembled their heaviest bodies of reinforcements. The
early bulletins, though very meager, indicated that one
of the greatest battles of the allied offensive is being
waged in the wooded region northeast of Albert.
The British advance apparently was in the direction
of Martinpuch heights and the plateau dominating the
road leading to Bapaume, the immediate objective of the
British attack.
The village of Longueval lies at the intersection of the
Bapaume-Bray and Albert-Combles highways and not
seven miles southwest of Bapaume. Bazentin-le-grand
lies immediately east of Contalmaison, whose capture by
the British was admitted at Berlin yesterday, and slight
ly northwest of Trones wood.
The French left wing pushed for
ward at the same time, according to an
imoff icial report from Paris, straighten
ing the French lines between Harde
court and Ouillemont and threatening
the village of Maurepas.
A dispatch filed at Paris at midnight
reported that the British had pushed
through the Mammetz wood where des
perate fighting has been going on to
the Longueval road and were but SOU
yards from the village. The remaining
distance was covered with a rush when
the offensive was resumed at daybreak.
The German position at Pozieres on
the Bapaume highway has been rend
ered extremely critical by the British
advance, Paris reported.
Great Batttle Raging.
Berlin. July 14. A great battle has

The British also resumed their attempts
to capture Trones wood and have suf

received at the war office.
The fighting is extremely violent on
both sides of the Somme. In the region

City men and farmers, the landed gen-'

The organization composed of landed

ital Journal of Wednesday.
I But the towns and cities of Russia
have also organized themselves into a

with the All-Russian Zemstvo Union,
completes the Central Committee.
The Central Committee, whose mem

Sundays and week-days in Petrograd,
acting as a eo-ordinnting body, central

COMMISSION OF SIX
Would Have Three From Each
Country Arrange Plan for
Protecting Border
Washington, July 14. A commission
of six men, three from each country,
will be proposed by General Carranza
ns an investigating body to study and
settle controversies between the Nnit
ed States and Mexico, it was learned
here today. The proposal will be sub
mitted to the state department within
two or three days. N-
The commissioners will be directed
to work out a complete series of re
medial steps probably involving the
patrolling of tie border by troops of
the two countries. They would have
inquisitorial powers and would be ex
pected to search out the causes of the
differences between the people on the
two sides of the boundary line.
They would be expected to make a
report, with testimony by Americans
and Mexicans as to the indents lead
ing to the border raid that precipitat
ed the punitive expedition into Mexico.
Neither Ambassador Arredondo or
Ambassador Fletcher would beon tile
commission nor would any officer of
the state department or the foreign ot-i
t'ice.. Mexican members. however,!
would be affiliated with the do facto
administration, though not in the dip
lomatic department. Negotiations
would start at some point on the bor
der, probably El Paso or San Antonio
in order that Mexicans and United
States military authorities might give
the commission their ielji.
Later the commission would come
north to some sumer resort Asbury
Park or Atlantic City being favorably
considered.

MAN EATER EVIDENTY
STRUCK SEVERAL TIMES
Three Thought Imprisoned In
Creek by Netting May Be
Killed Today
Matawan, N. J July 14. Terribly
mangled, the body of Lester , Stillwell,
victim of the man eating shark was re
covered from the waters of Matawan
creek early today. Great jagged wounds
in tho abdomen and breast showed
where the shark 's teeto had closed over
tho 12 year old boy's body.
Harry Van Clies, an engineer on the
Jersey Central railroad, and William B.
Clayton, Jr., who had been patrolling
the bank of the creek, saw the body rise
to the surface- not more than 300 feet
from where Stillwell was attacked Wed
nesday, at 5j30 a. m, today. They pulled
the body ashore and summoned the
county physician. Later it wns re
moved to a local undertaking establish
ment. A complete autopsy will be per
formed today. Meanwhile physicians
who examined the boy's torn remains
said the left side of the abdomen had
been ripped open and the flesh torn
from the right breast. The face showed
no contusions.
The United Press staff correspondent
was later permitted to view t tut boy's
body. The right and left breasts had
heon terriHv- - torn vAcodTently the
shark had bitten at -h flesh several
times. Another gaping hole was torn
in the boy's abdomen. The flesh from
the calf of one leg was missing from
the bones. Shark experts, to wnom
these wounds were described, 'snid it
was apparent the man killer had made
sevornl "strikes" at the body and prob
ably each wound represented a separate
bite.
It was the theory the shark must
have been about 12 or 15 feet in length,
and the location of the terriblo wounds
shows, they believe, that the fish seized
the boy across tho middle of the body,
rather than striking at his feet and legs,
All other cases of attack by sharks so
far reported have shown that tho man
eaters have struck for the legs of their
victims.

Every sort of a trap and weapon was
in use rifles, saluting cannons, pistols,

The mouth of Mntnwnn creek is how
coinnletelv netted. Volunteers nlso
worked today to put in a plunk screen
to back up this net and prevent escape
of the three sharks which hove been
seen in the upper reaches of the creek.
The tide begins to go out about noon
and when it reaches its lowest ebb the
hunters think the creek will be so shul
low that tho sharks can easily be locat
ed and dispatched.
Fishermen ol'f Atlantic Highlands,
N. J., today caught an eight foot shark
weighing about 2"0 pounds tiie third
ocean monster to be killed in the pns'J

the surface in a fish net and dispatched.
It was a "blue nose." In the fish's
stomach, it was said, were found the
carcasses of half a dozen smaller
sharks.
All the searchers after the man kill
ers were mightily surprised to learn
how yesterday the New Vork office of
two press associations captured the
shark and. after opening him up dis
covered remains of a hubnn body. The
! first word the workers here got on the
I rumor was from New York. Mntawnn
and the surrounding country is in dead

doesn't relish wild rumors so there was
considerable indignation expressed to
day over the author of yesterday's
fake.

Hasty Examination Passed
Many Weaklings Who
Give Out On Hike
-
By Webb C. Miller,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Columbus, N. M. July 14. Because
of hasty physical examination before
leaving Massachusetts, the border
militiamen stationed here may have to
undergo a more severe medical test.
The prospects are that this would; de
plete the ranks. Precautions are neces
sary to weed out weaklings, who be
come pensioners if disabled. '
Several militiamen aliected by tne
heat during hikes dropped in their
tracks and were brought back to camp
in automobiles. Their condition is not
serious. Humidity from the recent
rain and a temperature of 98 made the
weather oppressive.
Plans are being mnde for a long stay
by the national guardsmen. Wooden
flooring is being constructed in . the
tents and the men are building minia
ture adobe walls around tneir tents to
keep out water from heavy rains. A
higher and drier camp is being pre
pared for the militia. Six hundred
more guardsmen are expected Saturday.
Following the rains swarms of sand
flies nave appeared to make life mis
erable, for incautious militiaman who
shows a light in his tent at night. "
A bitter protest has gone up from
New Mexico militia recruits over the
quartermaster general's order that men
who enlisted after state mobilization
were not entitled to pay until mustered
into federal service and if rejected
lose their time and money spent await
ing the physical examination. United
States Senator A. B. Fall mnde a visit

the effects of the order, witn a view

waited a month for examination and
was rejected. He lost his position and
borrowed money to return.

BUILD ZEPPELINS TO
Captain Koenig Says Germany
r May Soon Hare Fleet
of Them
By Carl D. Groat.
(United Press staff correspondent.) ;
Baltimore, Md., July 14. Super-Zep
pelins, capable of carrying passengers
will probably soon be operating be
tween Germany and tho United States,
Captain Koenig of the German subma
rine Deutschland intimated today.
"We are. building such Zeppelins,"
he said, "and they are large enough to
hold 40 passengers."
"Will they come heret" he was
asked. '
"They might," he answered with a
knowing smile.
','1 knew about the .Deutschland six
months bofore it arrived," chimed in
Hilkea significantly, "but I didn't tell
all about it. But you can say that the
Zeppelins may come."
"Will they carry treigntl" toeing
was asked.'
"No, just passengers. We're mak
ing quite a few of these Zeppelins all
the time."
Previously Koenig had suggested
strongly to Baltimore city officials that
the airline is in contemplation.
"Quite an idea, Isn't it ships under
the sea and passenger fliers above the
sea," added Hilkon at the close of the
interview.
The sub-sea freighter Deutschland 's
dash for Gormany drew nearer today.
Her holds were rapidly filled with nick
el and rubber and everything wob ar
ranged whereby sho could make a swift
and safe cot-away.
Tho hydroplane stored secretly at her
dock will be used to "blaze a trail"
past the Virginia capes, if it finds any
hole in the British vessel lines, the
Deutschland will take the chance of
runninir the blockade immediately. In
any event, Captain Koenig is securely
confident that sooner or Inter he will
give the allied warships the laugh and
be on his way back with his million dol
lar cargo.
