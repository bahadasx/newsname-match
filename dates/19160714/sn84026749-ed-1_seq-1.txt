MATAWAN. N. J.. July H. Terribly
mangled, the body of Lester Stllwell,
victim of a man-eating shark, was re
covered from the waters of Matawan
Creek early today.
Great Jagged wounds In the abdomen
and breast showed where the shark's
teeth had closed over the twelve-year-old
boy's body.
The right nnd left breasts had been
terribly torn Apparently the "tiger
of the sea" had bitten at the flesh sev
eral times.
Another gaping holo was torn In tho
boy's abdomen.
The,flesh .from the calf of ono leg was
missing from the bones. Tho face
howed no contusions.
Made Several Strikes.
Shark experts to whom these wounds
were described said It was apparent
the man-killer had made several
"strikes" at the body and probably
each wound represented a separate bite.
Harry van Cllcs, an engineer oji the
Jersey Central railroad, and William B.
Clayton. Jr., who had. been patrolling
the bank of the creek, saw tho body
rise to the surface not more than 300
feet from where Stlllwell was attacked
"Wednesday at 6:20 a. m. today.

Eclipses of the moon are quite com
mon, although tonight's eclipse will be
of more than ordinary Intensity.
Ecllpsoa of tho room are caused by the
earth passing between the sun and the

moon. Whe nacllpses of the sun occur
the moon passes between the earth and
the sun. Eclipses of the sun occur
much less frequently than those of the

$3,020,185.62 Added to Dis
trict Appropriation Bill in
Repqrt to Upper House.
The sum of 13,020,185.62 was added to
tho District appropriation bill by the
Senate Committee on Appropriations,
which made Its report through Senator
John Walter Smith to tho Senate this
afternoon.
This brings the total of the bill up to
JH.952.0019S. The House bill carried a
total of 111,931,817.31.
Not only did the committee add
largely to tho measure and give the
District much more liberal and gener
ous treatment than the House, but, as
has previously been announced, the
half-and-half principle was strictly ob
served In making up the bill.
The House provision calculated to
abolish the half-and-half wus stricken

Approve Item for
New Guard Armory
House Building Committee Makes
Provision for an Appropria
tion of $800,000.
It became known today that an Item
appropriating IMX,000 for new armory
for tho national guard of tho District
of Columbia has teen Included In tho
public buildings bill by the Houso Com-
mltteo on Public Buildings and Grounds.
Report of this bill Is expected today
cr tomorrow.
The proposed armory Is to be erected
on Government property situate.! be
tween the New National Museum and
the Department of Agriculture Build
ing. Congressman Dyer, of Missouri, Intro
duced a bill some time ago asking an ap
propriation of $1,750,000 for an armory.
The House committee does not recom
mend this amount. It Is believed that
an JS0O.000 appropriation would suffice.
It Is not expected that the public
buildings bill will become a law at this
session of Congress.
Approves Promotion
Of Many West Pointers
The Senate Military Committee to
day reported favorably on War De
partment recommendations whereby
several hundred West Point graduates
of this year will become first lieuten
ants. It used to take a West Point man
from six to ten years to attain this
grade. The new army bill makes the
rapid advancement necessary.

Wilson Makes Bid
For Progressive Vote

Expressing belief that his party "rep
resents a larger part of the progressive
power and thought of the country than
any other party," President Wilson to
day made a formal bid for tho Pro
gressive vote at the coming election.
In a letter to J. C. Parker, Progress
ive, of Philadelphia, who had written
pledging his support. President Wilson
wrote:
"My Dear Mr. Parker:
"I have read your letter of July 10
with a great deal of attention and with
very serious Interest, and realize as
keenly as you do tho anomalous condi
tions by which many of the Progressive
voters of tho country are being con
fused and misled, as well as the old.
Inveterate attractions which seem to
control the choice of many of them

own part. I have no Jealousy whatever
of Independent organizations Intended
to keep the Independent voters of the
country reminded of their opposition
and fully Informed as to parties and the
conditions under which votes ure being
solicited.
"For myself. I sincerely dcslro and
have tried to deavrvn tho support of all
progressive, forward-locking men. I
believe, and I think that rccynt experi
ence has confirmed, that the Pcmocratlo
party represents a larger port of the

It can be made tho Instrument, and In

Cleveland Jurist for U. S.

President Wilson today nominated
Judge John It. Clarke, of tho Unltod
States district court at Cleveland, aa as
sociate Justice of tho Supreme Court of
the United States to succeed former As
sociate JusUce Charles Evans Hughes,
of New York, the Republican nominee
for President.
Judge Clarke was nominated on the
recommendation of Secretary of War
Baker, who Is himself a native of
Cleveland. The selection leaves New
York States without a representative
on the Supreme Bench.
Was Railroad Attorney.
Judge Clarke was appointed district
Judge by President Wilson and tho
Senate approvod the nomination after
an Investigation of charges against
Judge Clarke on the ground that he
was a railroad attorney and frlond
lv to the railroad Interests, fl
The Investigation developed the fact
that despite his connection with the
railroads, he had strongly advocated
the passnge o fthe two-cents a mile
act in unio.
A similar act passed by tho New
York legislature was vetoed by Justice
Hughes when tho latter was governor
of New York.
The White House, in announcing the
selection of Judge Clarke, Issued the
following biography:
"John Hessln Clarke, tho present
United States district Judge nt Cleve
land, wns born at Lisbon. Ohio, Septem
ber 18, 1887; was gruduated at Western
Reserve University In 1877, and was ad
mitted to the Ohio bar In 1878. Up to
the time of his appointment as district
Judge In 1JH, ho practiced law In all tho
colrts of Ohio, having a largo and va
ried practice.
Is Life-long Democrat.
"In politics he has been a life-long
Democrat; having run against Mark
llnnnn for the United States Senate In
1D03. Ho has been conspicuous in pro
gressive movements In Ohio and In the
country.
"Ho hn been for some time the presi
dent of the Joint Ballot Leaguo, of Ohio.
Judgo Clarke Is n bachelor and has de
voted the leisure of his life to wldo
reading, so that he Is a man of broad
and varied culture, and prohably tho
most gifted orator In Ohio. Slnco ho has
been district Judge In Cleveland he has
taken especial Interest In tho naturaliza
tion nnd Amerlcnnlzatlon of forclgn
born citizens."

Colonel Olenn, who Is, likewise, a
