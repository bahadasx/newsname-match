To the north, where the Oermans and
Austrian are withstandinc the terri-
fle drive of the Alavn, they have Dim-
nged to regain somo of the ground they
recently lost, and any thut the Hussinn

It is in this Rfokhod river sector of

all constitutional guarantees have been
suspended by the government, which is
taking drastic measures to blocji the
plans of the labor leaders, who have
announced a general railroad Btrike to

Mug Alfonso returned to the cap

mediately oabled a cabinet meeting to
discuss ways and means for allaying
the industrial unrest that threatens to
break nil bounds and overflow tha en
tire country.
The railroad strike, unless it is
averted, which seems unlikely, will tie
up the trackuge of the whole of Hpain
and will pu this city in a state of
prartieul siege. Nor ia the railroad
strike the only one the government has
to fear. Workers in all branches of
industry have shown their willingness
to join the railroad men in their atrike
.and are threatening to walk out. ;
The iron and ateel induatriea in the
neighborhood of Barcelona are particu
larly affected. Many factories will.be
closed immediately if the atrike ia de
clared and an auiieal will be mula tn
