REJECTED MEN
ARE STRIPPED
OFUNIFORN
But Col.Colston Forces State
Militia Officials at Ft.
Thomas to Change
Tactics
THEY TRY TO SHIFT BLAME
By Maurice Dunu
Ft Thomas Ky July IS Ail is not
harmony in tho mobilization
cimp of the troops of Kentucky
this morning. Tho storm broke
last night when sixty two me
from Company First Rjgimen
of Louisville were to be sent
homo almost stripped of their
clothing and uniforms they wore
to the camp because the State
holds each captain financially
responsible for ever partical
equipment alloted each man.
Things havo not been running
smoothly in tun cimp lor some
timo and considerable complaint
has been heard of tho suffering
tho dirqualifled men liavohad
to
undergo to make the trip home.
The issuo was brought to a head
list nicht when the detachment
from company was stripped of
tho most of their, uniform before
they started for Louisville. Many
of the guardsmen wore no shirts
and some had no socks s me
were worse clad in addition to
being subject to a driving rain
with little protection.
Tho manner in which the men
wcro about to leave tho camp
and the very unfavorable imp res
eion it would make on the cittzsn
of Louisville was brought to the
attention of Ool. Wm. A Colston
commanding officer ofhe first
Regiment. Ool. Colston soon
learned that it was withiu dissre
tiou of the company commander
as to the manner the men were
to have camp ab he alone is held
responsible for equipment.
Col 0ston rather than have
the moii return toLouisville in the
condition tlrey were in asked that
the captalns'ue allowed to return
to their home station with the
detachment and then collect the
uniforms eud return them to the
etato.
lie was iuforroed that the state
would not pay the expenses if
an officer to make tbe'trip.
Col. Gchtou's answer wi that be
fore he would allow these men to
leave this camp the money woul 1
bo expended from tho regiment) 1
fund and if this was not available
he would pay for it personally.
When the men learned thoy
would bo allowed to wear the
clothing thoy camo up hero with,
thero was .a mighty cheer for
Ool. Oolstou.
As the rcsul Lieut. II. H. Stnna
.left with sixty two men for Louis
ville last night aud will see that
tue equipment it returned,
