DURING STORM MONDA
Operations of the Federal Petrc
n leum company, in the Welsh oil fiel
were temporarily halted Monday a!
tOrnoon when the storm demoiishe
I the company's 110-foot derrick. Ver
fortunately the wind carried th
heavy timbers of the construictio:
away from the tool house into whic
the terrific downpour of rain ha'
forced the crew, leaving them un
hurt.
Work of clearing away the wreck
age and erecting a new derrick of
the site is being actively pursued
looking to the early resumption oi
drilling operations. Mr. R. F. Weich.
ert has made trips to Lake Charles
securing the necessary timbers foi
the construction. Driller J. R. Saun.
ders is being assisted in the work ol
sinking the big well by Messrs. Rey.
nolds, Ellis, Sarver, McCrea and
O'Brien.
Much interest is centered on the
activities of the Federal Petroleum
company, which is sinking the first
deep well in the sectiodr of the field
in which they are operating. They
have been making excellent progress
and at the time the storm halted op
erations Monday had reached a depth
of about fifteen hundred feet.
-Messrs. J. H. Butler and H. G.
Swisher of Dallas, Texas, represent
ing the Parlin, Orndorff Implement
company, were in Welsh Wednesday,

IN FINE FORM
H9Ar C'P, STAFFORD
?ur- Camp Stafford, La., July 8.---Ready
ecu- for service anywhere, the Second Sep
arate troop cavalry, Louisiana Na
tional Guard, commanded by Captain
Fred R. Phillips, is tugging at the
the hand which is keeping the troop at
Camp Stafford. The men, eager for t
by border duty, the officers anxious to
test the mettle of their command, I
daily are expecting order, which will I
put the troopers somewhere in Texas,
ley, where hors . will be provided and the
A. command p,,t in tip top shape. Though
r. no official a ,nounccrrnent has been I
made, it is p'cbabbl the cavalrymen 'i
soon will break camp and leave for e
active trainin7, if they are not sent t
direct to the border. I
Slightly below war strength, Capt. t
ch- Phillips' cavalrymen are being a
schooled in mnilita!y tactics, and fast !
are becoming good soldiers. The c
"yellow bands" have demonstrated in- ii
>xy formally they are expert in the use of t:
their fists and, with this as a rec- y
\at ommendation, the many qualities the
)ro troop attained under Captain Miller, eC
now a major, indicate the only Louis- 01
iana troop of cavalry now in camp Ii
the will bring honor to the state in a'my
ec- service. in
to- Most of the men live in Jennings, tr
La., or in the immediate vicinity. w
There are five men now in the troop ti'
tic who are from New Orleans, having lo
Ith enlisted with Captain Phillips about 31
rte ten days ago. A reporter for the
th Times-Picayune headed the party. 24
Three of them have become members L4
at of the medical corps, and the others D
he are affiliated with the troop.
i- Physical examination for federal P'
an service took place Thursday morning.
The men marched to the hospital
camp single file, where they under
s- went thorough examination. One of
r, the New Orleans boys was unable to
e- fulfill all the requirements and was
discharged, with nineteen others who,
for various reasons, failed to come up
a" to the rigid test for the federal ser
s- vice. The five city boys with the
troop are Edward Earl Hymel, W. H. Li
id Reed, Eliver Jourdan, Leon Guenard Pa
Ih and Dimitry Tomaswoitch. Re
Camp life seems to agree with the
Ã½f seventy-five young men in the troop. vil
11 Most of them, raised and bred on Fu
f farms, have taken to sleeping under Do
somewhat adverse difficulties like a eln
duck takes to water. The city fel-.
lows failed to take to sle ing on the tru
h ground with only a horse blanket ton
c separating their anatomy from the Ha
terra firma, but after a few days' LH
practice perfection came, and now St

BLANCHE SWEET AND
MARGUERITE CLARK AT
AUDITORIUM NEXT WEEK
The Paramount projlam for the
coming week at tmhe Auditorium Is one
of unusual variety, offering on Wed
nesday, July 19, Blanche Sweet, in
"'The Blaek List," a story of the sys.
teni by which certain industrial con
cerns make it impossible for dis
charged employees to obtain work
elsewhere. This story is said to bear
a striking parallel to the revelations
of the Colorado miners' strike of a
year ago.
In "Out of the Drifts," in which
dainty little Marguerite Clark will
appear Friday, July 21, the grandeur
of Alpine surrouidings forms a fit
ting setting to a story of battles

FIRE DOES DAMAGE
TO DENNETT HOME
Fire of unknown origin Wenesday
evening threatened the destruction of
the house occupied by F.B. Dennett and
family and owned by Mrs. Alberta
Chapman, and with the water used in
quenching it caused the total destruc
tion of all the furniture and household
goods of the Dennetts besides the per
sonal effects of a number of people who
occupied appartments in the house.
Mr. Dennetts loss is $2,134.60 with
insurance $1600.00 carried by the
I'isurance Dept. of the Ca!casieu Nation
al Bank.
Cammile Breaux loss, clothing and
personal effects $250 or $300. no insur
ance.
R. L. Craiger, furniture and clothing
insurance $90, carried by C. E. Carr.
Damage to house about $500 carried
by C. E. Carr.
But for the heroic efforts of citizens
fighting the flames effectively with
chemical engine and hose connected to
Mr. VanNess' tank the residence would
have been destroyed in a very short
time and owing to its close proximity
to other frame buildings might have
led to a very serious conflagration.
