London, July 13. Tho Germans
during tho last twenty-four hours
scored a notable success at Verdun,
where they captured 2,145 prisoners
In pushing their lines closer to the
Souvlllo redoubt, southeast of Floury
Tlllago and the Laufee work, south of
the Damloup-Vaux line. Souville lies
in the second defense line of Verdun.
Simultaneously the kaiser's array
on the Somme launched a great coun
ter attack against the British forces
and succeeded In recapturing lost
ground In the Mametz wood and in
Trones wood. Attacks at other points
were beaten off, the official British
headquarters asserted, though the two
reverses are admitted. It Is pointed
out that the Germans, since the Incep
tion of the allied drive, have received
large reinforcements.
Irish fuslleers penetrated German
trenches north of the Somme battle
field, but were driven out after twen
ty minutes. Seaforth hlghlanders suc
ceeded In a similar raid opposite the
Hohenzollern redoubt.
The latest British report states that
the Mametz wood, a portion of which
had been wrested from General Sir
Douglas Halg's forces by the Ger
mans, was again cleared of Teutons.
In the Trones wood, however, the Ger
mans still hold part of the ground
gained by their counter attack.
At Verdun six regiments of tho
crown prince's infantry were hurled
forward against the French positions
guarding the strong Souville fort, a
bulwark In the second defense line
to' the northwest of Verdun. Paris
admits that the attackers gain a foot
hold at various points of the French
line, but adds that the gain was made
only at the price of enormous losses.
On the Russian front, the battle
continues along the Stokhod river
with tho same determination to win.
Tho Germans are reported to be
bringing tip all possible reinforce
ments and guns in an endeavor to
save Kovel, against which the Rus
sians are advancing along two rail
way lines.
Russians troops have captured tho
town of Maaahatum, fifty miles west
of Erzerum, on the Tuzla river, by as
sault, says an omciai statement given
out by the Russian war office. Retir
ing Turks set fire to the town.

The United States is ready id

Mr. Arredondo said that details of'

make an announcement In a few days.
Henry P. Fletcher, tho American am
bassador designate to Mexico, was.
present at the conference.
News from Mexico generally fs en
couraging and reflects a' decided
change of attitude of toe Mexicans,
toward Americans. Commander Per-"-cy
Olmstead of the scout cruiser Sa
lem reported that his ship had been
given a most friendly reception at
Puerto, Mexico. They saluted the
port and the Mexicans were seen to
bring a gun to the water front to re
turn tne salute. The senior Mexican,
naval officers then came aboard the
Salem to pay a visit of courtesy to
Commander Olmstead and offered to
do anything for the convenience ot
the officers aboard. Other reports
from the Mexican coast show tho
same changed feeling towards Amer
icans. Department commanders were notf-
fled to call on the adjutants of the re
spective states for the names of quali
fied guard officers not already In the
federal service. The" rank o! major
will be the highest held by any re-,
cruiting officer and each officer ooi
this duty will be aided by two non
commissioned officers and a private.
Recruiting has been made necessary
by the fact that all unfit men and
those with dependent families are to.
be discharged from the guard regi
ments as rapidly as possible.
