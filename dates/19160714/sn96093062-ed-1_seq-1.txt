equipment and casing could bo se
cured. At a depth of 1,436 feot a strong
flow of very Baity water was struck,
and the well has been flowing an
eight-inch stream of it for eleven
days, and is still flowing. The shale

On the leaso on the Leo Thomp

town, the drill Is down 1,250 feet,

In talking about the route, 1'o'st-
maBter Early says that It is very im
portant thaL the -people tobe served
by tho route qualify immediately, ai
Frank A. Thackery, Chairman; J. II.
Fleming, and Field Clerk Le Croix,
)f-' "Madlll. The two members first
mentioned. With tho field clerk of
each district, comprise the Commis
sion. This district includes Bryan,
Marshall and Johnston Counties, al
though all the twenty counties in
vfalch live members of tho Choctaw
and Chlckndaw.tribes will be worked
Ijivthe same manner.
The committee has the name and
address of every roatrlcted Indian
In-..the two Nations, and goes over
land In an automobllo so as to see
and talk to the Indian on his own
gVqund. Ho Is examined In every
imagiable way, and photos of him
self and family, and views of his
place are taken, and sent to' tho
Department, together with a mass of
data. If the Indian is found to be
Jnble to attend to his own affairs,
his restrictions will bo removed, re
go rdles of his degree of Indian
blood. Mr. Thackery, In an Inter
view with a News man said that he
finds the Indian In much better con
dition here than in the counties far-.
(h$i north lu tho State. He gives
its, his opinion for that condition that
most of the Indians here live on
their own land, where they are mak
ing homes for their families; where
as, in some of the other counties,
their land, is leased out and they
scarcely v9r see It at all, much
less work it.
Tho committee' will be working
.out of Durant- for ten days or two
weeks.

The County Commissioners have
completed the preparation of the fi
nancial statemenOho county and
the estimate HHfefor the com
ing fiscal year. wlncMJthat tho
county needs for the yeaKteMUim of
U42.822. Of this sum Hfe.dQO- la
for State highway constructfeT nd
$15,000 for thecommon aehoonfuhd,
leaving only f 107,822 that represent
the oxponse of oporntlng the county'
government, and tho public business-
The estimate proposed amounts for
various county funds are as follows:
Salary Fund, $27,365; Court, $18,
010; Hood and Bridge, $14,700;
State Highway, $20,00?; Poor and
Insane, $4,700; Widows and Or
phans' Compensation,, $1,000; Sup
ply, $16,135; .Contingent, $15,000;
Separate Schools, $5,200; Common
School, $15,000; Sinking Fund (cur
ront expense bonda), $4,500.
From this amount, comes off sev
eral thousand dollars derived from '
fees of offices, leaving only $114,871
to be ralsod by taxation, and from
this is deducted $35,000 representing
Highway and Common School -Funds,
throwing the balance to $79.87KA8
soon as the estimate has been pub
lished as required by Jaw the excise
board will pass on it and either allow
various Items or cut them down as in
their judgment is necosary.
The road bond issue of $25,000
vote,d by Township Nino, now known
as Bennington Township,' and. sold
by the Commissioners some timo Ago
to Spltzer & Rorick, eastern bond
buyers, "must be resold, and tho'
County Commissioners will rocelvo
bids until Saturday af tornoon for tho
purchase of these bonds and will,
then sell them to the highest and
foest bidder. The bonds wero former
ly sold lo Spltzor & Rorick after a.
spirited bidding, and after it was al
leged other bidders tried to ball up
tho record, by demanding opportun
ity to bid after the time had expired.
The successful bidder took thorn
based upon their legal department's
opinion as to their validity. Tho
attorney for the buyer held the Issue
to be Invalid for tho reason, as
claimed, that the abolition of the
township form of government is un
constitutional. However, the Attor
ney General of Oklahoma has passed
the bonds as O. K.
Preparations are being made for
doing road work in this township,
and as soon as the b.onds are sold
and thBMuonoy rccoivdo tho improve
ments will be rushed to completion.
A'ORMA'L KEOKlflUO.V FRIDAY
otherwise the order Is almost snre tof he recePMon, to President -T. D.
be rescinded and considerable tlih'e
would be required to bring Itbaek to
life. Fronl the time this Is'prlhted
there Is given only ton days for the
postmaster to advise the Department
that at least eighty-five people have
secured an( Installed approved box
es, and this "means that the people
along the route will have to get a
move on If they want the service,
(JRI3AT CQIL; CROP IS
PREDICTED FOR THIS YEAR
A great corn crop for this county
Is predicted this year. In almost
any direction one goes in the country
he sees the best corn this county haB
had in years. Stands are good, tt
was laid by in clean shape, and prac
tically all of the early corn Is lh the
dough and needs only to fill out a
little more and hardou. Cursory ex
aminations of many fields reveals
that there Is. a good slzo ear to every
stalk and twu ears on lots of them,
with three ears on Borne. Tho Jafe
corn neN;ds a rain now, and a show
er will materially Improve the early
corn, although the. early corn prom
ises a good yield now without any
more molBture.
Brooks and tho Normal students-
will be given Friday night on the
spacjous laAvn. of M. E. Gooding, at
Fourth Avenue' and Cedar street, by
the 25 Expansion Club, The mem-
servo guests with their refreshments

Avoid the Needle Nuisance. Buy an-
EDISON DIAMOND AMBER0LA
You cannot realize all the needle nuisance means
unless you have had experiance with an out-of-date
needle-type "talking machine". No needles
on hand when you want them most, a continual
outjay of of money for new needles; the bother of
changing them after each selection, the ruination
of-cpstly records by the use of worn needles,-the
danger of children swallowing them or stepping on
them, with perhaps serioUs consequences. These
are only a few of the troubles of owners of the
needle-type "talking machines".
The Amberola not only eliminates the needFe
nuisance, but is far superior as a musical instru
ment to the expensive "talking machine". We
request an opportunity to prove this to you.
