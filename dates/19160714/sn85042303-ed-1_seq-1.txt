Sometime Wednesday night thieves

valueless to anyone but Mr. Akers,
a search about the premises and in
the rear of adjoining buildings wa
made with the result that the papers
and the l)ox were found In the rear
of W. A. Pride's shop. Among the
papers were some notes aggregating
several thousand dollars. When the
thief found that the package contain

quickest means, of disposing of it
with the above result. The officers

Alarmed by the spread of infantile paralysis in eastern states, the heads of this
ton and decided to ask congress for an appropriation of $100,000 to bo used for infantile paralysis research work
in fighting the disease. The urgent need of money was made clear by C. II. Lnvinder of the federal service, now
in charge of its work in New York, lie declared that the extent of the research work would depend solely upon
the amount of money available. Only about $15,000 is now on hand. It is becoming more and more evident that
the federal service faces a serious problem in preventing the epidemic from becoming widespread throughout
the east. With about 100 new cases discovered in New York City daily, the city authorities took drastic meas
ures to fight the plague, which leaves children paralyzed if it does nt kill them. Children were barred from all
theaters and moving picture houses. Sunday and summer schools were closed, picnics and other gatherings of
children forbidden and a general cleanup inaugurated. Many persons were arrested and lined for leaving gar
bage uncovered and for other violations of the sanitary code. It is held by many scientists that the common
housefly is responsible for the propagation of infantile paralysis, as it is for the spread of many other dis
eases. IMctures show: No. 1, children playing among gutter refuse; No. 2, the hodsefly; No. 3, passing candy
from mouth to mouth, a dangerous practice.

WANT TO SEE WHO IS STRONG
EST MAN, BUT ONE RACE HAP
A HITCH WHEN THERE WERE
THREE OPINIONS.
The candidates for county commis
sioner from the first district have
been indulging in a little elimination
running among themselves with the
view of settling on one man whom
they considered the strongest to con
test with Uncle Dud Young, the
present incumbent, and the result of
that race has developed a three-cornered
fight t ith G. W. Young, Jeff
O'Brien and John Mulkey as the con
testants. The race in that district Is "picking
up" rapidly and many picnics now
being held over that district are de
veloping some pretty warm argu
ments. Of course, each contestant
thinks he has the race "salted away"
already, but the general public real
izes the fact that people talk one
way and ofttimes vote another, so
there Is no telling what the outcome
will be until after the votes have
been countt-d on the night of August
the first.
There was another elimination rac.
developed in the sheriff's rare which
failed to materialize. It has been re
ported that three of the candidates
for that office agreed to take a straw
vote and see who was the strongest
man and then get behind him to win
over the present sheriff who is a
candidate for re-election, but it seems I
that when they began canvassing the
county each one thought himself the
strongest man, and therefore declined
to get from under, w ith the result that J
they are all in the race at present,
with the avowed intention of remain
ing there to the end.
I'p until a few days ago there has
been less interest in the coming pri
mary election than any held in the
state since Oklahoma was admitted
to the union, but during the past few
days things have begun to happen,
and from now on the campaign prom
ises to be real merry.
THIRTY-ONE DEATHS AMD HUN

AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS
WORTH MANY POUNDS OF CURE
WHEN DISEASE IS ALLOWED TO
CREEP IN.
There Is no sign of infantile par
alysis in Ardmorf, but physicians are
warning the people to take eyry pre
caution, and not invite that or any
other summer disease.
It is being pointed out that the
greatest preventive for summer ill
ness is cleanliness, and with the mos
quito just beginning to put in his ap
pearance the residents are urged to
take no chances, but to clean up
and burn all rubbish and trash, and
especially to drain places where water
has collected.
"And while I think of it," said a
physician, 'there is a lirHe hole about
thirty inches square along the gutter
just outside the postofflce that should
be cleaned up immediately. It is
about the most offensive drain hole in
the city, "and just why it has been
allowed to remain there week after
week is beyond me. Just such places
are conducive to sickness, and all
such should be dispoed of Immediate
ly." No one will dispute the victory of
George W. Perkins' pocketbook when
the elephant swallowed the moose.

DEVELOP A
SOME WOULD HAVE BROADWAY
OPENED EAST OF RAILROAD
NEW DEPOT MAY OR MAY NOT
INTERFERE WITH PLANS.
Evidently there is going to be a
lively scrap when tho Santa Fe be
gins to erect the new union passen
ger station, If the railroad erects It
where common report states they will,
because there are a few business men
on lower Kast Ifroadway who are de
termined that the street east of the
railroad tracks shall be opened up.
This Is going to involve a legal ques
tion because from the fact that a
few years ago the city entered into a
contract with the Santa Ko not to
open this section of street, in view of
certain concessions agreed to by tho
railroad company., Some time ago a
petition was presented to the Doard
of City Commissioners asking that
this street be opened, but tho city
officials refused to take action, in
view1 of the existing contract with
the Santa Fe. Those who have been
asking for the opening of the street
have been persistent, however, and
the chances are that they will take
the matter to the courts, if necessary.
The city engineer was asked at one
time to submit an estimate of the
cost of opening the street and the
necessity thereof. Ills report was
not satisfactory to those who desired
the street opened, but the city of
ficials, in view of his findings, re
fused to tuke any further action.
This Is the present status of the
case. The railroad will probably in
sist upon the fulfillment of the con
tract it has with tho city relative to
this street, while on the other hand
those who desire it opened will prob
ably try conclusions with the com
pany in the courts, If necessary.
