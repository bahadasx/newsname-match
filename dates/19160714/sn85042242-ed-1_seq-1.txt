TWO FIERCE BATTLES ARE
RACING IN THE CREAT
EUROPEAN CONTROVERSY
Russians Take 2,000 Prisoners.
The Austrians admit that the Rus­
sians penetrated von Bothmer's front,
but assert they were driven out again
in counter attacks. The Russians
cl^im to have taken 2,000 prisoners,
but make no mention of gain in ter­
ritory. The British have held their
gains on the Somme front and th»
usual period of consolidation and
pushing forward of the big artillery
is presumed to be taking place. A
similar situaton exists in the French
line, and a remarkably brief state
iatn* -of the French Thursday night
records the assault, of" the Soevillo
front.
Ample Ammunition 3uppliec.
'Premier Asquith, speaking in the
hotise of commons, declared that he
fefitish tupply of ammunition yas
ample and that the British-Franco
offensive was merely at its beginning.
A* second statement was made by
Minister of War LloyJ George, ad­
dressing on equipment. The minis­
ter declared the British output of
ammunition would soon oe over­

Further to the south a battle of almost, equal intensity is rag­

REVENUE COMMISSIONER
MADE ADVERSE RULING
Eighth Annual State Convention
Being Held at
Leeds
Mutual insurance companies may
yet be exempted from the federal tax
of .5 of a cent on every dollar of pre­
mium paid. W. C. Taylor, state in­
surance commissioner, is not satis­
fied with 'the ruling made on this mat­
ter by the United States collector of
customs and has taken steps to have
it changed.
In a communication which Mr. Tay­
lor sent to the North Dakota Mutual
Insurance association in annual ses­
sion at Leeds, he gives the status of
the controversy:
The law provides "that purely co­
operative or mutual fire insurance
companies or associations carried on
by the members 'thereof solely for
the protection of their own property
and not for profit, shall be exempted
from the tax herein provided."
According to a letter received by
Mr. Taylor from Congressman Nor­
ton, the commissioner of internal rev­
enue holds that this exemption ap­
plies only to fire insurance compan­
ies and that companies which write
policies for hail, cyclone, accident or
other insurance than fire must pay
the stamp tax.
"With all due respect to the com­
missioner of internal revenue," says
Mr. Taylor, "it seems to me that his
decision in this matter approaches
the ridiculous." What difference does
it make as to the kind of insurance
written. Isn't it just as important
that a farmer should protect his prop­
erty against loss or damage by cy­
clone or lightning, as fire? Does the
form of insurance affect the principle
of mutuality? No reserve is required
or maintained in any case.
"Obviously, this decision Is not bas­
ed on logic or sound sense, but rather
upon the necessities of the govern­
ment. Uncle Sam needs the money,

He dwelt at length on the problem of

in such instruction was a realization

Captain Koenig and Brave Crew
Are Given Worthy
Praise.
Baltimore, Md., July: 13.—Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador,
spent an hour aboard the German
subarine merchant marine, Deutscli
land, today. lie inspected the vessel
from stem to stern, had the intricate
machinery and instruments aboard
explained to him, and personally con­
gratulated Captain Koenig upon bring­
ing his vessel safely to America
through waters infested with hostile
warcraft. Two attaches of the Ger­
man embassy, the German and Aus­
trian consuls in Baltimore' and Mayor
Preston accompanied the ambassador
on his visit to the submarine. The
intense heat inside' the hull of the
vessel generated by sun rays beating
upon the deck au.i sides, prevented
the party l'r^ni ^iApaining aboard
longer than an hotify

The ambassador informed Captain
Koenig that he woul^ send to him, be­
fore the Deutschland starts on her
return voyage, several packets of offi­
cial papers which he desires to have
delivered, intact to the Berlin foreign
office. Some of these documents the
officials have been reluctant to trust
to the ordinary mails.
Ambassador Enthusiastic.
The ambassador was enthusiastic
as he emerged from the conning tow­
er of the Deutschland.
"It is a wonderful boat, and with
as courageous crew as ever sailed the
sea, has made a wonderful voyage,"
he said. "I climbed up and down
every hatchway, looked into every
compartment, ami had my first exper­
ience with a periscope.
"Captain Koenig did not tell me
when he expects to leave for Ger­
many, but 1 presume it will be soon
after he has his return cargo aboard.
He is in complete charge of the ves­
sel, and has his ordet-s from Berlin
his' craft is a private one, just as
much so as any North German Lloyd
liners. My visit was unofficial."

That more German supersubmarines like the Deutchland will defy the

and chemicals is the statement of Captain Paul Koenig, the Deutchland's
commander. These huge submersibles can carry a cargo worth $1,000,000.
Moreover, they can take back to Germany materials which will be of great
value to the kaiser in the manufacture of weapons of war.

New Rockford Attoriiey&~DecIar«
Function is Purely
Legislative
NO APPEAL UNTIL
PEOPLE HAVE VOTED
'New RockfoM, through its attor­
ney, Mr. Lawrence of Fargo, indicat­
ed yesterday that its main argument
will be devoted to attacking the right
of the supreme court to pass upon
the general question as to whether
the initiative and referendum amend­
ments providing for amending the
constitution by the direct action of
the people are self-executing or not.
An elaborate brief covering this posi­
tion has been filed with the court and
arguments by Bismarck and New
Rockford counsel will be presented to
the court next Tuesday.
Practically the same point is raised
in the suit now pending in the court
relative to the referending of the law
passed by the last legislature provid­
ing for a state board of immigration.
iMr. Lawrence in his brief takes
the position that the court has no
authority to restrain in this instance
until the amendment in question be­
comes operative by the vote of the
people.
The brief contends that the people
are acting in their legislative capac­
ity and cannot be enjoined by the
counts.
Bismarck attorneys take the posi­
tion that the act is not self-executing
and an attack will be made upon the
sufficiency of the capital removal pe­
titions.
Counsel for the Capital City is now
busy preparing an argument in an­
swer to New Rockford's brief.

Dr. 3. A. Danford was in the city
yesterday, enroute to Makoti, N. D.,
where he will conduct the camp-mee-t
ing for the Methodists of that part
of the state.
Dr. Danford goes from there to
Baton Rapids, Mich., as one of the
speakers in the state meeting.
He is still enthusiastic over a col­
lege for Bismarck and says he is
ready to begin whenever the people
say the word. The camp-meeting at
Jamestown passed a resolution again
favoring the college proposition.

plains Why He Refused Bismarck AtJ^rneyi ^Privilege: of*
amining Removal Petitions
AUBREY LAWRENCE FOR DEFENDANTS
The Supreme Court yesterday entered an order directing
Thomas Hall to give the attorneys representing Bismarck in thie
litigation.
piSiKS
Hall's Reasons.
First: Because the petitions
voluminous and hard to handle.
iSecond: Law provides no means
for recording or safeguarding the pe­
titions.
Third: Tn the examination a few
sheets might he misplaced or lost and
then there would not be sufficient
number of signatures to referend the
proposition.
Fourth: The secretary of state's
office is extraordinarily busy now and
has not the time nor the help to sup­
ervise properly the examination fit
these records by the public.
Fifth: Declares be is willing and
ready to allow inspection but that
there is no law to protect him against
possible destruction or mutilation" Of
petitions.
After Mr. Jackson had presented
these reasons, Justice Christi&nsaft
said:
"Are not most of these conditions
applicable to all state records?"
Miller Inaista On Point.
In answer to the objections, Mr.
Miller made no argument He Insist­
ed that the petitions Were public rec­
ords and that it was the right of aajr
citizen to examine them. Mr. Miller
declared that it was the positive duty
of the secretary of Btate to aid aaA.
facilitate such examination.
The hearing before the court yee
terday was upon the petition of Otto
Bauer of Mand an for an injunction
to restrain Mr. Hall from patting the
capital removal proposition upon, the

STRIKES CASE ON JURI8DI0Sl0K
Bismarck won its first point of contention in the legal battle
started yesterday in the state supreme court to determine wheth­
er the initifilive and referendum amendments to the state consti­
tution are self executing. While the point probably was mifcor
compared to the more weighty legal questions at issue, its set*,
tlement. means that Bismarck's attorneys can have full access to
the capital removal petitions.
Formal
jr
Application.
Attorney Andrew Miller, who Mi

of Bismarck attorneys, made formal
application at the hearing yesterday
for an order directing Mr. Hall to per*

features of this city's case is an at*
