The Board of Directors of the Glas
gow Comemrcial ( lub held a regular
.non hly meet'ng r.t tiw club rooms
last Friday night at which time Sec
retary S. C. Moore tendered his re
signation. He stated that as he had
been hard at work in the position for
two and a half years without any
rest, a vacation would do him good
and asked that the board accept his
resignation. No action was taken at
that time however.
The subject of a grade crossing at
Fourth Street over the Great North
ern right of way was further con
sidered and a report received from
the Secretary to the effect that the
railway company was willing to open
the crossing providing the crossing in
the west end of the yards was closed.
A committee from the City Council
and the Commercial Club waited upon
the County Commissioners at their
last session and laid the matter be
fore them. They expressed a wil
lingness to close the old crossing near
10th street upon condition that a new
one was opened on Fourth street. A
petition was circulated and filed with
the commissioners and will be acted
upon at their next meeting. The
opening of this crossing has been de
sired for many years and the Com
mercial Club effort to secure it has
at last appeared to be fruitful.
Two new grain elevators may be
erected in Glasgow before the harvest
season opens if the efforts of the club
to obtain sites on the Great Northern
railway right of way prove success
ful. At the present time the indus
trial tracks of the company are crowd
ed to their capacity but the new
track now being put down for the big
freight house the company will build
this summer here will furnish consid
erable room for the purpose. The
Club has taken the matter up with
.Jas. Robinson, Right of Way Agent
of the company at St. Paul and every
thing possible will be done to secure
from him the desired elevator sites.
There is a constant increase in the
acreage tributary to Glasgow put in
to grain and the necessity of more
elevators here is realized by the Club
and it is the intention to follow up
this work until satisfactory results
are obtained. Secretary Moore put
the matter up to Mr. Robinson from
the standpoint of the farmers inter
ests and it is expected he will act
favorbaly within a short time.
The Club will assist the visiting
teachers in securing rooms while at
tending summer school in Glasgow.
It is expected there will be about 150
teachers who will want accommoda
tions during the month of August as
the session opens on Monday, July
31st and will continue four weeks. A
list of rooms available will be made
up by the club and teachers will be
directed to them by the secretary as
they arrive. No charge will be made
to the teachers or the owners of
rooms who list them with the club,
it being the only desire of the Club
that every visitor finds comfortable
quarters at the lowest possible cost.
The Club desires a list of everyone
having a room to rent during the time
of the summer school.
An automobile ride about the city
and over the neighboring farming dis
trict will be given the visitors one or
two days of their stay, by the Club,
and other entertainment for their
benefit is being planned.
Delegates were appoointed to attend
of
the Good Roads and State organiza-1
tion of Commercial Clubs meeting to
be held at Anaconda July 13th to 15th.'and
This meeting is one of importance to !
the whole state and a good repre
sentation front Glasgow was desired.
Resignation Accepted.
At the special meeting of the Com
mercial Club held Thursday evening
at the Club rooms the resignation of
F. C. Moore, as Secretary was accept
ed by the directors. A resolution
was passed by the board expressing
their appreciation of the work done
by Mr. Moore during his tenure of
office of Secretary. No action was
taken to fill the position it being the
desire of the board to carefully select
*e one who will be qualified to take
u t ^ continue the work in as thor
oug»?*«Ananner as has been done by
the • secretary.
The Boii "thorized President We
dum to at twice take up the matter
of an elevator site on the Great
Northern right of way. A letter
was read from Jas. Robinson stating
there was not at the present time any
j oca tj on which can be offered for
another elevator but the club will en
deavor to secure one on the new in
dustrial track now being built in the
west end of the yards.
FORGER CAUGHT
WITH THE GOODS
Had Whole Book of Express Money
Orders When Arrested.
John Hollenbeck of the Nifty Tailor
Shop in this city has charged up just
Ç26.00 on the bad side of the ledger
owing to an experience which he had
with a bad check artist this week.
A fellow giving his name as W. F.
Moore walked into the shop Monday
morning and wanted to buy a pair
of trousers. After selecting what
he wanted he presented in payment a
money order drawn on the Dominion
Express Company of Canada, in the
amount of $26.00 The order seemed
to be o. k., and John accepted it giv
ing the stranger $23.50 cash in
change. Tuesday evening, he re-ap
peared at the shop with another order
for $25.00 drawn on the same coj>
pany. Mr. Klee, who was in at rho
time, was suspicious of the man and
refused to cash this order but held it
informing him that he would try and
have tne nionev for h ri in the morn
ing, to whi -ii the man consented. A
comparison of tho two orders proved
Klee's supicions to be well founded as
they were both torn from the same
book and bore consecutive serial num
bers, while one was drawn on Nidora,
Sask., and the other on Calgary, Al
berta.
After satisfying himself that the
orders were forgeries Mr. Hollenbeck
immediately swore out a warrant for
Moore. Shortly after the warrant was
issued Moore himself appeared at the
tailor shop to collect his $25. Mr. IIoI
lenbeck immediately invited him for a
walk to the sheriff's office, whore was
revealed a whole book of the Canadian
express orders on Moore's person. He
admitted that he had cashed the or
ders promiscuously along the line and !
offered to square matters with Holl- |
enbeck by presenting him with a
bunch of blank orders. He is now
being held on a charge of forgery.

Valley County is nearly a million and a quarter dollars richer this year
than in 1915 according to the figures now in the office of Assessor Ben H.
Cottrell. The total valuation of all property in Valley County is $4,799,518.00
exclusive of the railroads which were assessed last year at $1,665,617.00.
These latter figures added to the proj>erty valuations make a total of $6,
465,135.00 and shows a very creditable increase in the wealth of this County.
There has been quite a decrease in some of the live stock of the county
as compared with the assessments made in 1915 while in the matter of stock
cattle and stock sheep there is an increase. A good increase is also to be
found in the number of work horses and also range horses in the county.
That the increasing numebr of settlers in Valley County had had its. effect in
the number of work horses is evident and this item has increased the county
in wealth by a handsome margin of $195,006. Another increase due to the
large influx of settlers, is that of the number of acres assessed. In 1915
the total number of acres assessed amounted to 276,930 while the total
for 1916 is 368,359 an increase of 91,429 acres. Below is an itemized state

QUINTET COMING
KEKUKU'S HAWAIIAN
Exceptionally Fine Entertainment
Coming With Chautauqua.
There is an indescribable charm and
sweet fascination about Hawaiian
music that the whole world is striv
ing, but without success, to emulate.
No American stringed instrument ar
tist can imitate that peculiar subtlety
of expression so easy to the Hawaiian
on both native and international in
struments. Kekuku's Hawaiian
Quintet, coming to the chautauqua, are
the foremost interpreters of that
wonderful music nf thu Smith Spi
ondertul music of the .South Sea
Islands. The members are drawn
from the famous Toots Paka, Alisky,
and original Bird of Paradise Com
pan ies. It is a brilliant ensemble of
harp guitar, guitar, ukylele and tar
opatch players, featuring Joseph
Kekuku, originator of the celebrated
steel method of guitar playing. Mr.
Kekuku, is conceded to be the world's
greatest solo guitarist. He is the
genius of that seductive slurring of
the notes as they softly swirl like an
incense from the strings. Even after
the notes have departed from the in
strument with the taste and delicacy
of a sweet thought, they form an
echo chorus that seems to sing the
racial poetry of the Hawaiians—a peo
ple whose very language is a song.

Glasgow Boys Are Now Camped
At Douglas, Arizona.
ARE ALL WELL AND HAPPY
Pass Through Columbus En Root*
Which Still Shows Traces of Raid.
Regiment Makes Fine Showing.
(By Karl R. Peterson.)
After traveling tor four days and
four night, the Second and Third Ba
tallions of the 2nd Mcntana Infont 'y
arrived at Douglas, Thursday eve
ning, to assist in oatroling the border
and guarding the town against at
tack by the Mexicans.
From Helena to Tucumcari, New
Mexico, the train made excellent time,
but at Tucumcari, the train carrying
the 3rd battalion was attched to that
of the 2nd battalion and the remaind
er of the journey was made together.
Combined, the two trains were made
up of twenty four cars, and pulled by
one of the small engines over the
El Paso & Southwestern the aver
age speed was not much over twen
ty miles an hour.
About 5:30 Thursday morning the
Montana troop train arrived in El
Paso, one of the most important
cities on the border. A stop of two
hours and a half was made here and
the boys had an opportunity of get
ting a good view of the country, and
a few straggling Mexicans on the
Mexican side of the Rio Grande. The
town of Juarez was plainly visible
from the coaches and the route west
to Douglas followed the Rio Grande
river, and international boundary, for
a considerable distance Many of
he boys expected to see a wide,
rushing river and were disappointed
when they were told that the narrow,
I shallow stream was the boundary line
Every
j
] Ï^^ÛTs." and Mexico".
I thinR Qn the Mexican 3;de of the
river could be plainly seen from the
train, and the sight of the country
they might be called on to invade gave
the boys much food for thought.
En route to Douglas, the train
stopped at Columbus, N. M., and a
number of the regulars stationed
there met the train and chatted with
the boys. Question after question
was popped to them and smilingly,
they answered them all as best they
could. Besides the cavalry and In
fantry regulars stationed there, the
Massachussets Militia has been de
tailed there for duty. The town still
showed traces of the raid, and many
of the buildings were still undergo
ing repairs. The tents of the sol
diers could be seen in every part of
town, and with the big Ynotor trucks
running back and forth, and soldiers
going from place to place, the little
town resembled a bee-hive for activ
ity.
One of the truck drivers, in talking
to some of the G Company boys stat
ed that the supply line to Pershing's
men extended over the border for 250
miles, but that it would probably be
shortened to about 107 miles. All
supplies and water for the troops was
hauled on huge motor trucks, every
one of which was heavily guarded
in making the journey. The regulars
were more than pleased with the ap
pearance of the Montana boys, and
said they were the best looking out
fit that had passed through there. AU
the Montanans were tanned and har
dy looking and the manner in which
they carried themselves made a big
hit with the regular army men.
The train pulled into Douglas about
8.30 Thursday night and as it was too
late to detrain and pitch camp the
•nf.n «lent on the traie ar.. immediate
a
ly after breakfast Friday morning,
march« d over to the camp site and
sta-ted in clearing th* grounds and
getting everything in shape for a
permanent camp.
With guns stacked and packs piled
up the men fell to the work of grub
bing out cactus and leveling the sand
hills. Within a few hours the camp
site had been cleared and the rising
tents and hordes of men swarming
over the regimental city gave it a
busy appearance. Every bunch of
cactus and all bushes were taken out
by the roots and by the second day
every company street was in excel
lent order, a strange contrast to the
uneven brush covered prairie on all
sides.
The camp site is located about 3
blocks southwest of the Calumet
