Canadian Worker Charges
British Labor Was Weak
Submitted to Conscription With
out a Struggle and Waived
Rights
From Hip B. C. Federationist.
Vancouver, July 13. —It is a well
known fact that he workers of Great
Britain (with the exception of Ire
land) have waived practically all of
the privileges they have so labor
iously wrung from their callous and
brutal rulers during the past, In order
to aid those rulers to successfully
prosecute the present war. At least
that is what they have been led to
believe, through the sophistry of the
spokesmen of British class rule.
That they have been weak enough
to waive these privileges upon the
mere assurance that their masters
would return them at the end of the
war, indicates a weakness closely
bordering upon stupidity. Surely they
should know that the word of no rul
ing class was ever worth anything
where any material interest was at
stake.
As painful as it may be to think of
these workers voluntarily waiving
their rights and privileges in defer
ence to ruling class interests, the
most amazing and painful part of it
is to be found in the circumstance of
their meek submission to the conscrip
tion scheme foisted upon them by
the government.
Vote Shows Weakness
To show how weak they were, it is
but necessary to mention a few facts
in regard to the passage of this pre
cious act. The full membership of
the house of commons is C7O. The
vote stood: For the bill, 250; against,
35. It may be seen from this that 385
members did not vote.
Apparently the most of these feared
the politcal consequences. At the
manner in which the labor move
ment as a whole laid down in the
matter, and meekly submitted to
being made an enforced part of a
"Prussian militarism," the fears of
FOR PREPAREDNESS PARADE
San Francisco. —The Bulletin of
this city says if a preparedness pa
rade manager stuck up a few mot
toes like the following in his demon
stration it would take the parade "at
least five years to pass a given
point":
"Preparedness requires:
"A living wage.
"An eight-hour day.
"Abolition of slums.
"The reform of all unwholesome :
living and working conditions.
"The elimination of unemploy
ment,
"A guarantee to workingmen of all
the rights and privileges mentioned
in the constitution.
"A shifting of emphasis from prop
erty rights to people's rights.
"A centralizing of national policies
upon the creation of a free, healthy
race, too strong, just and free to be
conquered."
Bear in Mind
That tho union label is the emblem
of organized industrial workers and
that your patronage of it is your en
dorsement of trades unionism. Tn
the proportion to which you fail to
demand labelled merchandise you are
helping to throttle the very backbone
of your movement. The union man
who can find excuses for not patron
izing union labelled products falls far
short of living up to the principles
of organized labor.
PAINTERS ADVANCE
Newport, U. [. —Painters' union No.
534 has signed an agreement with
building contractors and furniture
shops for a wage scale of $4 a day
of eight hous. beginning March 1,
1917. This is an increase of 50 cents
a day.
The United States In 1915 had 69
lynchings, an Increase of 17 over 1914.
these politicians were, evidently, un
warranted.
It is as well known to the ruiers
and masters as anythin
right upon the heels < ir of
theirs will come a da; reckon tig
with the enslaved an Inl rl d
working class of all countries. It dees
not require any remarkable keen
vision to see that.
The rapid growth of political and
economic intelligence among the
workers during recent veins has not
(been overlooked by the misters.
\ That this has been fori I by eco
nomic pressure they well know. Thai
the result of this war will be to
greatly increase and Inti nslfj that
pressure and thus speed
cation of the workers, is
to them. Unless they have a
disposal a military estabii i c if
ficiently powerful to cop b the
difficulty, their regime of industrial
and commercial maraudin and pi
racy may come to an end.
Masters See Crisis
There never was yet"a"'s|av'<~that
did not have a soldier for hadow. i
There never was a military tablish
ment except for the purpos- of hold
ling slaves in subjection their
masters. It is now as always, that 1
the military must be recruit d from
the ranks of the slaves th' n
for the reason that there is
source from which recruits can come.
Unless Oreat Britain and these
other countries have at the end of
this war large forces under arm -, and
to be kept under arms, there will be
no asurance of the rulers being able
to withstand the upthrust of labor
in the direction of a greater liberty
and wider participation in the control
of industry and the enjoyme nl of
its fruits.
The masters of wealth in the United
States realize this as well as do those
of Britain. That is why there Is such
a frenzy for preparedness. They, too,
are preparing their slaves in uniform,
to hold their fellows in overalls in

THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE
DEVOTED TO THE INTEREST
Rights of Americans
Denied by Injunction
"The government of the United
K'atos. through congress, has said
that 'tho lahor power ot a human
being is not a commodity or article of
commerce,'" says the United Mine
Workers' Journal.
"Bui while Ibis human labor power,
which includes tho worker himself, is
conceded by the federal government,
not the property of any except the
worker himself, to grant or withhold,
singly or collectively, as he decides,
many of the .judges of state or dis
trict courts still hold the contrary to
be Ihe fact. In no state in the Union
lean there be any written law to jus
tify such a position; the laws of
equity, confined in every other coun
try, and now by the government of
United States as only applying to
property disputes when irretrievable
a mage may be done, and for which
i ere is no other redress, is based on
what la known as the common law,
based on the laws of chancery of the
monarchlal governments,
i we hold that the expression of the
government of this country on the
status of a citizen within this country
must be binding in every state.
"We have always maintained that
the writ of injunction when applied
to the labor power of human beings
was only based upon usurped power;
yel it was found necessary to enact a
I supplementary law to wrench this
v urped power from the hands of
venal ignorant or subservient federal
judges It may be best to demand
laws, conforming with the law of the
country, in all of the states.
"In Ihe meantime we do not believe
it best to submit to injustice through
usurped power.
"We hold it is the right and duty
of all the workers to disregard the
claim of property right in labor power
even when allowed by the ermined
servitors of the employers.
"It may mean imprisonment for
some, but only by determined re
sistance can we hope to call attention
to tl Injustice of this assumed
power."

SHERIFF OUSTED
BY HIGH COURT
Walsenburg, Colo.—Sheriff Jeff
Farr, procurer of strike-breakers, pet
of coal operators, gunman and "king
of Huerfano county" for l(i years, has
been ousted from office by the state
supreme court because of illegal
election practices.
It was proven that Farr's election
was made possible through the es
tablishment of voting booths in iso
lated places and In camps controlled'
|by the coal companies. Farr and four i
associate officers, who were also
ousted, were charged with fraud and
corruption. It was shown that no om
| could approach the booths In the
mining camps controlled by the Victor
Fuel Company and the Colorado Fuel
and Iron Company without permission
of the coal company officials. The
supreme court declared that in these
camps unqualified voters were al
lowed to vote and legal voters were
denied. The court refused to consider
the vote of the closed camps and held
that Farr's opponent was elected be
cause of pluralities he secured in the
uncontrolled camps. Practically even
polling place was in a building or on
land controlled by the operators.
"Thus," said Supreme Court Justice
Scott, "were the public districts and
the public election machinery turned
over to the absolute domination and
Imperial control of private coal cor
porations."
The passing of Farr will bring lit
tle regret to trade unionists and other
citizens who made continued protest
against the tigerish ferocity of this
official during the recent miners'
strike in southern Colorado.

American and Mexican
Unionists Meet
CALL UPON ALL WORKERS TO UNITE FOR PEACE
Washington, July 13, .Monday rep
resentatives of the American and Mex
ican trade union movements met in
this city and pledged their faith to
international harmony and the work
ers' cause. It was the first meeting
of its kind ever held.
Those present, and who signed the
declaration embodying these views,
were tho executive council of the
American Federation of Labor and the
following representatives of the Mexi
can workers: C. Loveira, Baltaznr
Pages. L. N. Morones, S. Gontalo
Garcia and Kdmundo E. Martinez.
The meeting was the outgrowth of
a suggestion made by President
Gompers to the Mexican trade union
movement, several weeks ago, that a
conference be held at XI Paso, Texas,
between representatives of the work
ers of both countries for the purpose
of discussing questions of mutual in
terest and strengthening fraternal
ties.
Later it was decided to meet in
Washington. The first conference,
July 1. was devoted chiefly to ex
planations and discussion necessary to
mutual understanding. The follow
ing Monday practical suggestions for
immediate problems were considered
and declarations approved and signed
by the representatives.
"It is an unavoidable conclusion,"
declared these workers in their
signed statement, "that present differ
ences between the United States and
Mexico are the result of misunder
standing growing out of inadequate
or incorrect information." and that
"the unfortunate consequences of past
relations between the United States
and Mexico have formulated a na
tional attitude that questions the good
faith of our governments: that exist
ing agencies and methods of reaching
an adjustment of these differences
tire unsuitable for dealing with these
problems which are fundamentally hu-

request was granted, but not until the

man problems, anrl that the relations
between our countries ought not to
be directed in accord with abstract
standards of justice, but ought to be
keenly sensitive and responsive to the
human interest and moral forces."
The conference urged upon their
respective governments "the appoint
ment of a commission to be composed
Of high-minded citizens, fully repre
sentative of our nations, to consider
differences that have brought our na
tions to the verge of war and to make
such recommendations for adjustment
as shall fitly express the highest
ideals of the great rank and file of
the citizenship of our two countries."
It was agreed that copies of this
declaration be presented to President
Wilson and to General Carranza. and
thai it be given widest publicity
among the workers of both countries.
It was also agreed that another
conference should be held, in which
the workers would be more generally
represented, for the purpose of agree
ing upon plans for maintaining per
manent relations and for the federa
tion of the labor movements of the
western hemisphere.
As present conditions preclude an
immediate meeting of this character
it was decided to forego holding same
until later in the year, unless an
emergency arises "which would make
a general conference of advantage in
averting an international crisis."
To earn- this plan into effect a
joint commission is to be chosen of
two members from each labor move
ment to remain in Washington until
the present crisis ! s passed. This
commission is empowered to call an
enlarged conference, if necessary.
The Mexican workers are enthusias
tic over the open-handed welcome ac
corded them by American trade union
ists and both agree that the seed
sown by Resident Gompers will
germinate into a solidified Pan-
American labor movement.
ADOPT UNIONISTS' METHODS
Methods used by trade unionists to
promote their interests are often
adopted by men in other organizations
| for their own good even when those
very men condemn their use by the
unionists, says the Minnesota Union
Advocate. For instance, the Pitts
burg Underwriters' Life association
refuses to recognize any person as a
legitimate insurance solicitor who
does no! continually "work at the
trade." The association has unani
mously resolved to protect its jurisdic
tion by excluding from field service
all temporary insurance writers. The
members of the association consider
this a proper and justifiable stand for
them to take, but when members of
labor organizations take it they "in-
Cringe on the liberty of the individual
Citizen" and "impair the sacred right
of free contract " The whole matter
appears to depend on whose ox Is
gored.
