KENDRICK. LATAH COUNTY. IDAHO. FRIDAY. JULY 14. 1916
NUMBER 28
SURS IT THE
cirai cm
Royally Treated by the Boise
People
(Special Correspondent.) Since
Flag Day Boise has been celebrat
jf, Ing. Flags have \ een flying from
( every flag pole in the city and many
other demonstrations were daily in
evidence. Of course this gala spirit
culminated on the fourth of July
when a four days' celebration eclips
ed anything heretofore attemped by
the Capital city. The Combined civ
ic and military parade on the Fourth
was one that will hardly be equalled
in many years to come.
Of course the soldier boys had
much to do with this prolonged pat
riotic display. Gamp Morrison on
the edge of the city, with its thous
and boys in kahki was the center of
many' civic ebullitions occuring at
frequent intervals. Boise treated
the Second Regiment with marked
distinction. The uniform admitted
the wearer to all the vaudevilles
free; at one prominent business
place soft drinks and ice cream were
advertised to be as free as water to
the soldier. Automobile parties came
from the surrounding towns laden
with goodies for the prospective
border defenders. The Captain of
Company C was more than anxious
to get away from Boise so that his
boys might dine on something more
substantial than "pie and cake."
And so the days wore on.
Boise citizens are the very cream,
of good nature.. Their loyalty knows
no bounds and their generosity to
the soldiers could hardly be equal
ed. But one cannot live long in
Boise without imbibing' an over
weening desire to relegate the State
House gang to private life. The
late fiasco between this gang and
the Governor is one most seriously
to be regretted. We are not at
tempting to place the responsibility
but opposition to the Governor would
have bocome a factor in mobilizing
the National Guard in any event.
Aside from this disagreeable po
litical feature the boys will long
remember Boise. If the menu, at all
times, was not up to the standard
fare of a soldier, hard-tack and
beans, the soldiers at least took to it
as ducks take to water. But the
7th day of July came on apace. It
was the time set for the regiment
to entrain for the border. They
left Boise between eight o'clock and
midnight. Early in the evening the
streets became lined, crowded and
jammed with interested humanity.
The soldiers occupied the main
thoroughfare to the depot for hours
before the trains pulled out.
The crowd itself was a study for
the psychologist, the dress maker
and the tailor. The psychologist
A zould have been interested in the
varied mental states engendered by
Vie same external influences. The
Mress maker would have been tickled
to note that if our first mother,
dear old Eve, had worn a pair of
* those ivory white shoes her costume
would not have looked* very tnuch
out of date after all. But that is
another story and aside from the
object of this letter.
Did you ever see more than a
thousand lunch baskets assembled
atone place?
If you didn't you
have missed something. We have
no reference to the average grub
box but to a thousand baskets pre
pare^ by mothers, wives and sweet
hearts without regard to labor or
expense. ^ If they were as good in
side as they were delicate and pretty
outside, then indeed did the soldier
boys çnjoy a parting treat that will
long be remembered. Amid tears
aapd cheers and God-bless-you's our
bpys weçe carried away to "some
where in Arizona." and Boise has
settled down to the hum drum of
everyday life.
I
Burglars Cover Fingers
Burglars who took the precaution
to cover their fingers so as not to
leave tell-tale prints, entered the J.
J. Wells hardware store at Union
town Thursday night, July 6, and
took $300. A pane of glass was re
moved from a door and the night
latch operated in gaining an en
trance. No money was taken from
the Devauld pool hall which was
entered by robbers the same night.
UTAH
OUNTY
DAT
FAIR
BEEN FIXED
Special Features Have Been
Added
The date of the Latah County
Fair, to be held at Moscow, Idaho,
is Sept. 19-23 inclusive.
As a special feature that has been
added to Division "C" Grains and
Grasses, attention is called to the
following;
For the acre of ground producing
the most bushels of wheat, in the
year 1916; First premium; Litho
graphed Certificate, and $5.00 cash.
Second premium ; Lithographed
Certificate, and $2.50 cash. Third
premium; Lithographed Certificate.
The same premium is offered for
an acre of oats, and same for an
acre of barlev.
All these exhibits are to be ac
companied by samples of the grain,
in sheaf and in sack.
Entries under this class to be
made by the grower, while the grain
is still standing, this summer, and
the fair officials are to appoint some
one to measure the ground, to be
present when threshing is done and
measure the ground when threshed.
All these facts to be certified to
the judges of this division, at the
fair date, for award.
No awards will be made unless
there are two or more entries of
each kind of grain.
Juliaetta Cannery
The Juliaetta cannery is now in
operation for this season's run. Ac
cording to a report from Juliaetta
there are 8 men and 17 women em
ployed at the canning factory at the
present time. Cherries are now be
ing canned and packed.
After the cherry season is over
the cannery will handle beans and
tomatoes. The tomato crop around
Juliaetta has been a big item for a
number of years and the little can
ning plant has advanced the value of
land very much. Some day Kend
rick will have a permanent cannery
as the conditions here are ideal for
a plant of that kind. Hundreds of
tons of fruit go to waste in this
section every year and a cannery
could utilize every bit of it.
Party at Guy Hotel
Mr. and Mrs. C. L. Guy invited
a crowd v of young people to spend
Tuesday evening at the Guy Hotel.
The dining room was cleared of the
tables which gave plenty of room
for games and dancing. The Kend
rick orchestra furnished music dur
ing the evening. Refreshments
consisting of strawberries and cream
and cake were served.
Miss Ruth Madden arrived in
Kendrick Thursday to visit at the
Wm. Freytag home.
Mrs. A. Douglas, of Moscow, who
has been visiting her two sons, Bert
and Steve and her daughter, Mrs.
P. O. Baker, at Southwick returned
to her home Thursday. Mrs. Doug
las came to Southwick twenty-one
years ago and for twelve years was
a resident of that place, moving
then to Moscow where she has re
sided since.

Urged to Become Candidate
John C. Rice, a prominent attor
ney of Caldwell and well known in
the banking world of this state, is
being urged by, his many friends in
all parts of Idaho to enter the race
for justice of the supreme court.
They declare that Mr. Rice has every
qualification for the high office and
that his legal standing in the state
is of such a character that should he
enter the race he will immediately
attract to his support many men of
influence.
The race for justice of the su
preme court is made non-partisan
by the primary law. There are at
present two candidates announced,
the present chief justice, Isaac N.
Sullivan and Justice Robert N. Dunn
of Coeur d'Alene. It was said in
Boise by those interested in the de
velopments in this race that should
the friends of Mr. Rice be able to
influence him to enter as a candi
date, he will from the time he takes
such a step become one of the most
formidable. They were pleased to
learn that his name had been men
tioned and discussed for the high
office. It is understood that Mr.
Rice has given no intimation as to
what effect the urgent demands of
his friends have had.
L. G. Peterson returned Monday
from his trip east. He spent just
two months on the trip and visited
many places of interest. He got as
far south as West Virginia.
Bean Hoers in Demand
Ed Fleshman sent to Lewiston
last week for men to hoe beans.
Eight or ten came up on the next
train and were taken out to the
Fleshman ranch. There is an un
usually large acreage of beans this
season and the wet weather has in
terfered to such an extent that a
few patches will have to be disced
under on account of the heavy crop
of wild oates.
BRIDER CUIR
RIIS ORGANIZED
Meeting Held at Moscow on
Tuesday—Big Attendance.
Friends of Miss Catherine T.
Bryden met at the Court house
Tuesday night and completed the
organization of a non-partizan Bry
den club, the preliminaries of
which were started at a meeting
Monday night. Plans were formu
lated for the furtherance of her
campaign for the office of state
superintendent of public instruc
tion.
The membership of the club is
extended to everybody in Latah
county, regardless of political affil
iations. A campaign for members
is being launched and it is expected
that an enrollment of 1000 will be
had as the campaign progresses.
Resolutions framed by a non
partizan committee, were submitted
at the meeting and were adopted.
They read as follows:
Whereas, Miss Catherine T. Bry
den has announced herself as a cand
idate for State superintendent of
Public Instruction:
We, the citizens of Moscow and
Latah County, her neighbors, asso
ciates and co-workers, independent
of party-affiliations, in mass-conven
tion assembled, knowing best her
qualifications, worth and ability, and
appreciating her valuable and de
voted services to the city, county
and state in her educational work,
do hereby resolve.
That we recommend Miss Bryden
to the voters of the State of Idaho
as a lady of superior intellectual
and educational attainments, hav
ing had long, varied and successful
experience in educational work, pos
sessed of rare executive ability;
original, zealous and forceful in her
methods and in every way qualified
to discharge the duties of the high
office to which she aspires with cred
it to herself and the state.
Crops Looking Good
Guy Lewis took the writer for a
ride in his new 1917 Overland last
Saturday morning. It was about a
thirty mile trip and quite a scope
of country on Potlatch ridge was
covered. The crops were a revel
ation. Anyone who holds the idea
that this part of the country hasn't
splendid prospects for a good crop
this year should travel around a lit
tle and be convinced of his mistake.
The spring grain never looked bet
ter and the winter wheat shows up
favorably.
Some of the bean fields were full
of wild oats while other fields were
quite clean, showing the difference
in the methods of farming used.
The farmer who gave his field thor
ough cultivation before planting is
having very little trouble keeping
it clean while those who planted
their crop with the idea of cleaning
out the wild oats and weeds after
their beans came up, are having a
hard time of it.
Mrs. Hecht, of Reubens, who has
been visiting the past two weeks
with her daughter, Mrs. Jim Rod
gers, of this place, returned to her
home Wednesday.
LIGHTNING ERIM.Ï
DESIROUS BURN
Zirbel Building Burned Yes
terday Morning
Lightning at 1 o'clock Thursday
morning struck the bam at the
Henry Zirbel place on Lapwai road
in the eastern part of the city, set
ting the structure on fire. The
bam was completely destroyed, the
loss including a horse, buggy and
considerable equipment. A granary
is located in quite close proximity
to the bam, but the favorable di
rection of the wind saved this
structure.
The loss to Mr. Zirbel is about
$500. Some insurance was carried.
When the lightning struck, a
number of people in the neighbor
hood were aroused, including those
at the Zirbel home. The flames
spread so rapidly there was no
chance to check the fire.
The Lewiston fire department re
sponded to a telephone call and
made a run to the scene, but tne
fire had progressed to such a stage
that no service could be rendered.
It is rarely that lightning strikes
in the Lewistnn valley and the fire
Wednesday is the first reported
from that cause in a long period of
time.
Road Planer*
h(d
Back in the middle states they
are using "road planers" instead of
the ordinary road drag which is
used in the west. A road planer is
a machine with two twelve foot
blades that can be set at different
angles so that the blades will lack
from 4 to 18 inches of meeting at
the center of the road. Back of the
blades in the angle formed by them
is a steel drag which flattens out the
center of the road. The drag leaves
a flat narrow ridge of pulverized
dirt in the center of the road. This
can be crossed readily.
The cost of one of these machines
is $580. A tractor is required to
pull it. While the first cost of the
outfit would mean quite an invest
ment, the fact that much more
ground can be covered in a day than
with the ordinary drag and horses,
makes it an economical investment
in the end.
An ordinary day's work with a
planer is fourteen miles of fairly
level road. It does more than drag
the roads and its work is superior
to a poor job of grading. It takes
a day to grade a mile of road work
ing five or six teams and the cost
would be from $30 to $60. With
the planer the cost of working the
road is approximately $1.60. In
the fall the planer can be used for
cutting ditches at the side of the
road, and when used in this way 25
to 30 miles a day can be worked.
Of course this machine would not
work on the grades in this section
of the country but it would surely
do as well on the roads in the prair
ie country of Latah county as it
would on the roads of the middle
states.
Hupp Shoots a Bear
Harry Hupp shot a bear in Troy
last Sunday evening. The bear was
seen crossing a field at the edge of
town. All the sports in town were
soon on its trail in the hopes of get
ting a shot at it. Harry borrowed
a rifle and waited at the top of a
knoll until the bear was driven out
of the bush. The first shot he fired
hit the bear on the point of his
sholder, the bullet coming out thru
the neck. It knocked the bear down
but he got up and started to turn
around when Harry shot again and
killed him. He weighed about two
hundred pounds.
