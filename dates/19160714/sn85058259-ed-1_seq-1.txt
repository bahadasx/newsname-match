" MURRAY PAPER OBJECTS
i ', TO THIRD TERM PROGRAM
I Yes, Governor William Spry has
li " - been unable to resist tho great pres-
(P- " sure of his many frionds to persuade
1 ' - him to aspire for tho nomination in
6 the Republican rnnka for governor of
ffik '. the state of Utah for another four
years.
Zk Spry has already sorved tho peoplo
K of this state for two terms, or eight
m '. years, and that should be enough for
IN Jit any self-respecting true blooded Amer-
r. ' . jgB:.Ican. The old familiar songays, "we
tV "" jXwant no cowards in our band," and
art we would like to add further, "wo
TL want no monarchs ip our band," which
' wl we beliove to' be tho sentiment of
r , every loyal citizen In the stato of
Utah.
H Governor William Spry, in our esti-
U mution, proved himself to bo the equal
V . of a coward when ho assumed the un-
i dignified attitude he did at the close
y v of the last legislature, when he ret
, fused to veto tho Wootten bill and
4 send it back to the stato legislature.
W that they might .comply with the will
It ' the people and pass the bill over
W hia head. If ho had done this ho would
avo glcaned '8 own hands of the
V,
v. i
matter and proved himself to bo a
real man. But not so. Ho choso the
other despicable method and tho fault
is all his own fhat tho people of Utah
hnvo lost confidenco in him. Ho can
blame no one but himself.
When Governor Spry approaches
the republican purty nnd ngain asks
the nomination to go before tho people
of the stato for election as governor,
ho takes the first step towards estab
lishing a monarchy in this fair land
and by that very act robs the cradel
of every mother in this stato of one
opportunity of her son becoming gov
ernor. Two terms are enough as governor
of any state in the Union, and prece
dent has made it nmple for any presi
dent of the nation which these states
finally mako up. The third term is
contrary to the spirit of true Repub
licanism and is a blow to tho consti
tution of freedom, guaranteed us by
the state.
Furthermore, it is a sad reflection
upon the standard of manhood nnd in
telligence of tho state to think that
he who has-been honored 'with tho
power to rule for two terms should
npporently assume that there is no
other citizen of the stato as well qual
ified to fill this position as hiinself.
As far as we are concerned wo arc
just loyal enough to other candidates
of the party to refuse to stand for
such n deal.
If Spry is nominated in the Repub
lican state convention at Ogden, it
will mean that the Republican party
will be defeated at tho polls in Novem
ber. In other words, we must have a
man in whom the people have confi
dence and ono whom they will know
if elected will net like a man nnd sign
tho prohibition bill when it is present
ed to him. Tho American (Murray)

ASSESSED VALUATION OF
IRON COUNTY PROPERTY.
Tho following figures represent the
assessed valuation of properties with
in Iron county, including public utili
ties, for tho present year and for the
year 1915:
Total assessment, 1915, $2,788,245.
Total assessment, 1916, 5,804,150.
Of the latter amount the public
utilities arc assessed with $2,011,873,
while in 1915 they were assessed with
only $824,050. The railroad property
was assessed in 1915 at $744,143, and
for this year at $1,892,064. By a
comparison of these figures it will be
seen that the value of property as
sesseduby the.county.asscssor was not
increased nearly as much proportion
ately as that assessed by the State
Bi,?,r.d ?f Equalization (tho public
utilities) so in the opinion of the
County Clerk we may expeet a raise
by tho State Board this year. How
ever, we shall know as to that in a
few days.
TRUE GREATNESS.

And pn tho little acts committed horo
Our future bliss or misery depend.
But vhllo Bojournlne In this earthly state
wo have assigned us duties crcat and

And If our minds bo centered on the irrcat
We scarco will noto tho llttlo ones at nil.
But If tho little ones wo bear In mind
And dally meet them with a cheerful
smile,
K'en counting them as duties wo will find
Fow thlngB In llfo arc better worth our

Somo people think them scarcely worth it
thought:
But few perform them with sincere re

ought
A vlrtuo that will bring Its own reward.
Good llttlo deeds brine future blessings

Tho tiny germs our fathers hid away
Within the earth produced the trees thai
bear
Thoso luscious fruits tho world enjoy to
day. And 'tis tho llttlo particles of stone
That build the mighty fortress of stato,
And 'tis tho little acts of klndncss'shown
That makes tho human soul supremely

Small courtesies wo to eachothor owe,
And If wo pay them with bocomlng grace,
Tho final record of thoso deeds will show
Tho good we'vo dono to thousands of our

It may not bo that wo possess tho powor
Or clianco to save a fellow creaturo'a life;
It may not bo our lot In war's dark hour
To dlo for country In tho bitter strife
Wo may not climb tho plnaclo of fame;
Wo may not rank or affluence acquire,
May add no lustre to our family name
Nor any notoriety desire.
But we possess a secret Influence
That may be wloldod of our own freo will,
E'er upward In the sphcro of excellence
Or downward through tho tangled maze

Wo all possess tho powor to smooth ana

WIUi llttlo acts of kindness day by day.
He who lifts up a heavy laden soul
Longing to llo Hfe'H weary Burden down.
Oalns a strldo nearer tho celestial goal,
And adds a jewel to his future crown.

To malaco bear, or cruelly wound a heart;
And If by chanco wo causa nnotner grief,

And strive to banish bltternesH and strife;
And may wo never In our darkest mood

IS NED FOR
PROW ACTION
W. C. Stark in Letter to Paxnian
Urges Importance of Our
Getting Busy Now.
WHAT OTHERS HAVE
DONE TO OBTAIN ROAD
Two Tilings Procrastination or a
Rnisc in Price Would Prove
Disastrous to Project.
The following, which is a copy of a
letter addressed by W. C. Stark at
Salt Lake City to Mr. J. W. Paxmnn
at Ncphi, in relation to tho land pro
ject in this vnllcy in which both nro
interested, is self-explanatory and
will, wo feel sure, prove interesting to
our readers:
"Salt Lake City, July 7, 1916.
"Mr. J. W. Pnxman, Ncphi, Utah.
Today was the first opportunity I have
had to talk to Mr. Manderfield of the
Salt Lake Routo in regard to tho Ce
dar land project. I have been a mem
ber of A Troop, First Utah Cavalry
for some time and was called out tho
Monday morning we arrived homo.
I have been on the jump ever since
nnd havo no idea how the people of
Cedar Valley havo taken to the. plan
wo suggested to them while in Cedar
City.
"My visit with Mr. Manderfield was
very satisfactory. Ho tells mo that
when tho officials of Salt Lake were
in Cedar City recently, Mr. Wnnn
mnde a public statement to the effect
that he had collected a large amount
of data on the Cedar Valloy and was
still at work on the subject. Surely
this remark from a man who holds the
position with tho Salt Lake Route that
Mr. Wann does should bo indication
enough to tho Cedar people that the
railroad is interested in the valley and
is only awaiting some show of inter
est on tho part of the people there be
fore making definite statement.
t "Mr. Manderfield is of course careful
in tho statements he makes about what
the road will do, but ho points to the
Delta branch and the fact that it was
built "as s6on' a'g enough" pTople had
moved onto tho land adjacent to it to
make certain tho fact, not that the
branch would pay at once, but that it
would eventually nay. So, it seems
plain to me that all the railroad needs
is encouragement along the right
lines.
"The land project, in my opinion, is
the best form of encouragement in the
world. It would increase the .value of
the land and the value of products and
put n lot of snnp and go in tho entire
valloy. But, tho people of Cedar must
stnnu ready to mako some sacrifice if
these benefits aro to be obtained.
Nothing is always nothing no matter
how it is figured and a big thing like
a railroad should bo very cheap at the
cost of about 20,000 acres of land at a
fair price. I was in ono community
not many years ago where 20,000 ac
res of land were put in at no cost to
get a railrond. I might remark that
that country is now one of tho most
prosperous farming districts in the
intcr-mountain region and that it sup
ports two large towns.
"Both Mr. Lafont and Mr. Strevell
were pleased with the report I turned
in on the land. They think it is a good
selling proposition but urge that it be
gotten in shape quickly so that the
literature can be gotten out and the
details arranged before fall and the
best selling Benson arrives.
"I will not bo able to give the matter
much time until tho trouble with Mex
ico is over and since you und Mr. La
font are both so busy we will have to
depend largely upon tho committee at
Cedar to get tho project in shape. If
they want it sold this fall the options
should be completed by tho' first of
August at the latest. Personally, I
should like to see this done. These
projects that aro conceived and found
practical and then put through with
a vim nro nearly always successful.
At least this has been my experience,
while those thnt drag out never a
mount to anything.
"Mr. Lafont and Mr. Truman both
promise mo that they will bo ready to
go ahead with the land sales as soon
as tho Cedar peoplo havo done thoir
part. I think you may as well mnke
it plain to nil land owners that tho
matter is now strictly up to them and
that if thoy want thoir land sold nnd
a railroad and all the improvements
that go with it, the options should be
signed up at onco and at prices you
agreed upon verbally.
"As I see tho matter two things will
spell defeat. First: A long delay in
getting the matter in shnpe. Second:
A raise in price when it comes time to
sign tho option. In ono case interest
wiil dio and no ono will hurry to take
up a land project that has boen once
declined; and a raise in price, such as
we experienced with two options we
signed in. Cedar, moans that tho esti
mates already made will havo no
value.
"I hope you will hnvc time to go to
Cedar City again in tho near futuro
and while there, get at leost 20,000
acres of contiguous land at a reason
able price. I am sure that Mr. La
font and Mr. Truman will give tho
project as caroful attention as I would
and I know that under proper con
ditions they enn sell tho land,
"YourB very truly,
"W. O. STARK."
B. A. C. TO BE
JUNIOR COLLEGE
Principnl R. F. Homer, After Weeks
of Persistent Work, Announces
Success of His Plans.
Principnl R. F. Homer, who has
been in the north on business connect
ed with the B. A. C. for n fow weeks,
is expected home today or tomorrow.
Mr. Homer was seen at Salt Lako the
other day by a representative of Tho
Record nnd stated that everything was
arranged for tho introduction of a two
years' college course into tho curricu
lum of tho local school. Tho following
is tho program as agreed upon with
tho trustees and president of tho A.
C. nt Logan: The coming year of
1010-17 tho complcto high school and
kindred courses as heretofore given
will bo retained, and ono year of col
lege work will bo added. Next year
another year of college work will be
added and possibly the first year of
high school work will bo eliminated
and will bo added by tho county school
bard to tho public school course at tho
locnl school. The following year tho
second year high school course will
be "lopped off" at tho B. A. C, making
of tho institution a bone-fide junior
college, and tho courses thus eliminat
ed will bo given in the district schoolc
of Cedar City and Parowan.
Mr. Homer stated that there would
bo tho closest kind of co-operation be
tween tho B. A. C. and tho Collego
faculty at Loban, and that tho cred
its obtained hero would bo accepted
at any college in America, giving the
same clcasses of work. Tho collego
courses will be under tho direct super
vision of tho department heads at tho
parent institution, who will mako fre
quent visits hero, outline the courses
of study and co-opornte with the local
instructors as closely as possible.
Work on the material for tho annual
catalog is now under way, nnd it is
expected to be ready for tho printer
within a few days and ready for dis
tribution to the public in a couple of
weeks. It will issue from tho press of
Tho Record.
Mr. Homer has also held a number
of conferences with tho regents and
officers of tho University of Utah, and
stated that the tho most cordial rela
tions would maintain with that insti
tution. He has almost positive assur
ances that tho University ''will also
reinstate 2 years of tho Normal courso
as 'given nt the local institution prior
to tho change from tho U. of U. to tho
A. C. This would give the young peo
ple an opportunity to select the kind
of a courso they like, or to take train
ing looking to almost any of tho trades
or professions.
The fact that President Widtsoe is
now at tho head of tho University
gives encouragement along this line,
as he is so well acquainted with con
ditions hero and tho needs of tho
southern counties.
Taken all together, tho futuro looks
brighter right now than it has ever
done in tho past for the local institu
tion, and the only thing that is now
lacking is a greater abundanco of
house room for tho students nnd fam
ilies who will come hero for the win
ter, and wo aro pleased to state that
this matter is now receiving attention
by somo of our influential peoplo and
will doubtless shortly be provided for.

REASONS FOR STATE
UTILITY COMMISSION
A Concise Statement of Condi
tions Which Warrant Such
a Department.
ONE-FOURTH OP STATE'S
WEALTH IS IN UTILITIES
General Public Not Sufficiently Posted
to Judge as to Whether Chnrgcs for
Service are Reasonable.
Editor Iron County Record, Dcnr
Sir. It is pretty certain that tho next
Legislature will pass a mcasuro do
signed to regulate public utilities. It
Is important that such a mcasuro be
a true bill, dealing adequately and
justly with tho subject. It should not
be a makeshift, a compromise, or so
full of defects nnd inconsistences that
no ono will bo satisfied.
Thero are always a few comprehen
sive principles that should control all
legislation. Public necessity and con
venience is the dominating idea hero.
Somo controlling facts are:
1. Utilities aro a public necessity.
2. Thoy (in most Instances) occupy
tho streets and public highways un
dor franchises.
3. To multiply them in competition
would monopolize such streets and
public highways to the inconvenience
of other public usors.
4. Duplication, or competition, in
many instances would needlessly in
crease tho cost of tho service or com
modity. 5. The vast amounts of capital in
vested ($122,000,000 in Utah) and con
trolled by a small group of people,
relatively, would in tho mnin make
competition impossible, if it were de
sired. 6. All necessities should bo furn
ished the consumer at a reasonable
charge, and railroads, telephones, etc.,
arc necessities.
We have been told that we have no
utility question in Utah. Tho Stato
Board of Equalization reported the as
sessed valuation of such property in
this state at one Tiundred," twenty-two
millions of dollars, nearly ono-fourth
of all tho property in the state.
Who knows that tho charges for
tho servico furnished by this one hun
dred, twenty-two millions of invest
ment is not higher than it should bo?
Only a few people who control know
anything about ft, nnd thoy usually do
not think rates are too high. On tho
other hand the consumer, who knows
little about tho matter, usually thinks
he is being exploited.
Every citizen who honestly invests
his savings in utility property is en
titled to a fair return as dividend, but
absolutely no more, this because of its
public character.
Tho parties to both Bides aro enti
tled to a squaro deal, but neither is
capnble of deciding tho whole question
equitably, hence it must bo referred to
some disinterested party invested with
authority to detcrmino and enforce de
crees. Charges aro not tho only questions
to be adjusted. Ono of tho many
others is physical connection.
Our state is entering an area of ex
tensive development. Our little (?)
investment in utilities of ono hundred,
twenty-two millions is going to be
doubled and trebled. We should begin
now to study this question and get it
in hand before it gets more trouble
some. Let our public control develop
with tho growth of tho state.
Yours truly,
J. S. WOODBURY,
Cedar City, July 13, 1916.
Improving Fair Grounds.
Tho County Fair Committee has a
forco of men at work on the fair
grounds these days and good progress
is being mado in getting the site in
shape for tho fair. Thomas DIx is In
chargo of tho work, and those who
havo promised to contribute labor, and
as many more as aro in a position to
do so, snould report to him.
Tho Committee is also busy with
other phases of tho fair, which thoy
promise will bo a big success this year.
Among other things in tho way of
amusements tho committee is nego
tiating for an aeroplane to glvo exhi
bition flights during tho fair.
It is expected that tho premium list
will shortly bo in print and ready for
distribution among tho peoplo of the
county.
Will Enforce Dog Tax Law.
Elsewhoro in this isBUo of Tho Rec
ord will bo found a county ordinance
relating to the licensing of dogs in
Iron county, and which amends an
ordinance of previous passage, We
aro also informed by the County Clerk
that it is tho intention of tho commis
sioners to have tho law rigorously en
forced hereafter.
Persons within tho county having
canine pets or assistants thoy wish to
retain would do well to mako early ar
rangements to secure registration
tags for them.

State Land Board passed through to
day en route to St. George to attend
a public land sale at that place. Mr.

PROTEST AGAINST SUGAR M
TRUST FROM IRON COUNTY M
Tho Evening Telegram, the only H
Salt Lake daily newsnnper which is H
not dominated by tho Utah-Idaho H
Sugar companies, printed tho follow-
intr ns its leading editorial yesterday: H
"The Telegram issued a challongo
nbout ten days ago to the weekly H
newspapers of Utah to take up the H
fiirht for tho peoplo against the nvorr H
iciousncsB of tho locnl sugar trust. H
Tho first Utah paper to como to our H
notico with a protest against the out- H
ragcous sugar prices 1b tho Iron Coun- H
tv Record, nublished at Cedar City by
Chnrles S. Wilkinson.
t "In tho issuo of July 7 Editor Wil- M
kinson travo his readers something to H
think about when ho printed n two H
column editorial condemning the sug- H
ar trust's methods. H
"If all tho weeklies in this state H
would nrove themselves as fcnrlesn H
nnd independent nn The Record and H
(rive their subscribers tho facts about H
tho sugar holdup, tho trust would H
havo to mend its ways. H
"For thero is nothing so strong ns H
an aroused public sentiment, H
"Wo fcol sorry, really, for many of H
tho smnllcr pnpers. H
"Wo nlwavs fcol sorry for nnyono fl
who IS AFRAID. M
"And when ono considers tho H
strength and power of tho Utah- H
Idaho Sugar company nnd tnkes into H
consideration tho position nnd influ- H
onco of the men who dominate its pol- H
icy he censes to wonder why the small H
napers shiver at tho thought of bring- H
ing down on themselves tho wrath of H
that sugar crowd. H
"Even three Salt Lake dailies, with M
millions behind them, have not only H
failed to make one tiny protest a- H
gainst the overcharging for sugar, H
but on the other hand have given a H
page each to Bishop Nlbley for n mis- H
representing defense of the trust. H
"So it is not strnntro that tho week- H
lies remain silent whilo tho powerful H
sugar trust continues to exploit tho H
peoplo who made it possible for tho H
trust to tret its start. H
"Tho Telegram is going to rcuro- H
duce the Iron County Record's editor- H
inl in full. Wo mention this so that H
tho trust can put in an advanco order H
for extra copies to mail to its friends. H
Wo feel suro that the trust will want H
to do this. Here is a snmple of tho H
editorial in question, referring to H
Bishop Niblcy's long dissertation pub- H
lished in all tho daily Salt Lake pa- M
pern excent Tho Telegram:" H
(Hero follows the concluding para- "Av-.H
crapha from our editorial repWtolMryTf" VtB
NJbley.) ' -K ;& -.
Tho Telegram, like The Record. is( M
making a valiant and praiseworthy - 2
fight in tho interests of tho common M
peoplo against tho indcfensiblo dis- H
crimination against them in the price H
of sugar, and our only nrotest is that H
Tho Record and not Tho Telegram. H
opened up this fight. In our issue of H
May 26 we had a column editorial on H
this question, which has been followed H
each issue with additional facts nnd H
comments, nnd wo feel certain that it H
was ns much in reply to our articles H
as to the Patterson pamphlet, of which H
wo had no knowledge until some time H
subsequent, that the Nlbley nrticlo H
was written nnd published. But it H
makes littlo difference which was ere- H
ated first, "tho chick or tho egg." It H
is often tho case when a real necessity (!
exists that a number of minds begin '!
to work along the same lines simul- "!
taneously, without being conscious of H
eachothor. And when there is a H
spontaneous outburst of public sent!- H
ment on any question or nbusc, it be- , H
hooves the persons responsible for it H
to "sit up and tako notico," for it is H
a pretty certain evidence that there is . H
good reason for tho criticism. Pco- H
plo might be mislead in time into a H
false position by Borne artful manipu- H
lator, but when you see public scnti- H
ment beginning to erupt at divers H
points throughout the country of its H
own accord it is timo for somebody to H
sidestep the steam roller. A little - ' H
better price on sugar, please! H
