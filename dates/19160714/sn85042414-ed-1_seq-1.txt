Washington, July 14.—-The advisory
report on the status of the German
merchant submarine Deutschland,
submitted to Acting Secretary Polk
today by the government neutrality
board, is understood to hold the vessel
to be a peaceful merchant craft, and
entitled to all privileges as. such. The
indications are that the state depart
ment will make no formal announce
ment concerning the submarine, but
the treasury department will be ad
vised to permit her to clear, and sail
from Baltimore whenever the captain
desires.
Acting Secretary Polk received the
neutrality board's report just before
he went to the White House for the
cabinet meeting. He intimated that
a fotmal ruling of the department
"wouljd be. necessary only in case the
submarine was found to be a warship,
and liable to be. ordered from Ameri
can waters.

The Deutschland having discharged
her cargo, is undergoing some minor

the Deutschland worked all day.
Their task seemed to have been com
pleted last night and the work of
loading the return cargo, consisting
principally of crude rubber and

New YOrk, Jitfy 14.—Shark hunt
ing became a popular spott along the

New York bay aitd along the ocean
side of Long Island, as the result of
recent raids of majveating monsters
from southern waters, which have

Poisoned" by Teeth.
Dr. George B. Reynolds of Matawan
who attended Stanley Fisher, who
was so seriously mangled in a battle
with a. shark- yesterday that he died
a few hours later, performed an au
topsy on Fisher'e body-today.- He de
clared he found that the 'flesh torn by
the man-eater's teeth was impregnat
ed vlth a peculiar poisonous liquid
which seemed to have a deadening
effect on the nerves and muscles. This
probably explained, .he said, why
Fisher apparently had little sensation
of pain when the shark took off his
l«g.
Believe Victim Devoured.
Little hope is entertained for the
recovery of the-body of 12-year-old
Lester Btlllwell, the other victim of
the Matawan creek tragiedy. It Is be
lieved that-he was devoured* by the
shark, as persistent dragging of the
inlet and dynamiting of the waters
have failed to, bring up the body.
Many confllctlng reports were receiv
ed here during th* day from various
points along the 'New York and New
Jersey coasts regarding the killing
of sharks, but only one appeiurs.to
have any foundation in fact. This was
the news brought In by Anthony
Lundy, captain of a, fishing boat, who
said his party of New York JWhermen
had dubbed to death a nine-foot
shark weighing 450 pounds, while

The British government already

TO BE FOLLOWED
BY PROSECUTION
Lawyer May Urge Death
Penalty in Event of
Conviction.
Waukegan, 111., July 14.—The final
plea for the acquittal of William H.
Orpet, on the charge of murdering
Marion Lambert, was resumed by
James H. Wllkerson, Orpet's counsel,
at the opening of court today.
Wilkerson is expected to finish be
fore night- He will be followed by
David Joslyn, special prosecutor aid
ing State's Attorney Dady, who will
make the state's Anal plea.
Mr. Joslyn would not say today
whether or not he would demand the
death penalty.
The case is expected to be in the
hands of the Jury by tomorrow night.
Allege Influence.
Throughout the case the state has
made thinly veiled charges that H.
G. Carlin, an investigator for the de
fense, Influenced the Wisconsin wit
nesses—William Zick, Orpet's room
mate, Otto Peterson, his close friend
who saw him fill the bottle of
molasses and water Charles Hassln
ger who sold him the bottle and Mrs.
Naylor, to remain away.
Witnesses for the defense in many
instances, notably Josephine Davis and
Dorothy Mason, were grilled as to
their conversations with Carlin.
Mr. Wilkerson's remarks to the jury
covered old ground in a new way. His
tneme was that the presumption of
Innocence, which the law grants every
defendant until lie is proven guilty,
makes clear and innocent every detail
of the evidence urged against the de
fendant.
"Cornerstone Nh."
'The cornerstone of the case of
the prosecution," said Mr. Wilkerson,
"rested on the fact that Orpet spent
the night of February 8 in the garage
near the green house where cyanide
of sodium, then thought to be cyanide
of potassium, was kept Marlon died
of cyanide of potassium poisoning,
and when the cyanide was discovered
in the green house the state jumped
to the conclusion that Orpet poisoned
her and with the presumption of guilt
has bent every innocent circumstance
to fit the theory.'^

fensive in the neighborhood of the
Somme rtver, which began July 1,
over a front of something more than
20 miles. The first phase of this of
fensive carried the British forward to

French on the .right moved their lines
fjirtfcer forward.
