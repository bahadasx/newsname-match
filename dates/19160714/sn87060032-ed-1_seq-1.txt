Last Tuesday the Fiscal Coirt
met with the new State Road
Commissioner, Mr. Wiley, and
settled the question of the routes
through Knox county, which is
as follows: Starting from Bar
bourville, north, by the way of
Bailey's Switch and on up Pop
lar Fork of Richland to the
Middletork road, then up Middle
fork by way of or near the
Christian church, then turning
through the Gilliam Gap through
Gray's Station to Corbin. Then
from Barbourville, by the Fight
ing Creek route through Flat
Lick to the Bell county line.
The meeting did not last veiy t
long, and Mr. Wiley showed i
himself to he a man that means
business. He did the work that
could have been done by Terrill
while he held the same position !
a year ago, and by this time we
would have every inch of the
road graded, and possibly had
the stone on it. '
The meeting was a secret'
meeting, and we are told that
there was a real hot time in the
County Judge's oflice. Squire
Jackson has fought a noble light
for his constituent, and it looked
for awhile like he would be left
out in the cold, but he has done
well for his people, as well as,
did Squire Fortncv and Squire'
Monhpllen.
We have always said that we
wanted the roads started in some
way, and we have always kept
our nose out of the airair, but we
nay now as we have said before,
that we want the roads start
ed in some direction and as all
cannot have a road built right in
front of his own door, we are
glad that .it has been settled in
some way.
This gives us the line though
the County, and will give us the
official "Dixie Highway" which
all are happy to know.
Just at the conclusion of the
meeting of the Fiscal Court, the
Dixie Highway Council had a
meeting, and several addition
were had to the organization,
and Gov. James D. Black, an
nounced to those present that

The Railroads and Coal Com
panies are attempting to manipu
late certain candidates, who are
friendly to them in the race for
Judge of the Kentucky Court of
Appeals, and if they have their
way about it and succeed in their
plans, at least two candidates
will be taken out of the race by
the corporations, and an effort
will bo made to unite the in-
fluencied, which are controlled
by the big money interests in an
effort to nominate a friend of
of corporative wealth. At a re
cent meeting held at Winchester,
where the Railroad lawyers and
politicians were in conference,
one of the participants declared
"If something is not done Samp
son is going to beat the whole
bunch," meaning that, if the
corporations did not succeed in
taking oiF one or more candi
dates, and putting their forces
behind some favorite that Judge
Sampson would win this nomi
nation. Can the Corporations manipu
late the politics of this district?
Can they manage the candi
dates? Can they take them off
or put them on at will? If these
candidates come off will it not be
plain to well informed persons
that they have been removed
from the running by the gentle
hand of corporate powers? The
plans are on foot and are in pro
cess of consumation. How strong
these influencies are, is yet to be
seen. If any of the candidates
for Judge of the Court of Ap
peals are eliminated from the
race, the people will know how
and why it happened. Keep an
eye o,i the line of entries. Watch
for results.

The National Bank of John A.
Black, is one of the solid financi
al institutions of Barbourville and
Knox county, and adds in no lit
tle degree to the town's prestige
as a commercial center, integri
ty of its officials, conservative
business transactions, combined
with its capital and resources,
makes it not only a popular but
trusted banking concern, whose
operations extend to all parts of
the county as well as throughout
this entire section of Eastern
Kentucky.
This bank was established in
1800, as a private bank, but later
was merged into a National Bank
and by the courteous treatment
of its clients by the officials, it
has grown in public favor with
the passing of years. Its affairs
are in the hands of experienced
business men who have devoted
many years to banking business,
who have made it a study and
have the interest of their deposi
tors and customers at heart, be
ing ever ready to extend every
accommodation possible to those
who are seeking a modern bank
ing institution. They are men
in whom the greatest confidence
is placed, and after years of suc
cessful operation have never fal
en short in the estimation of
their many customers and friends
They have always been identified
with the progress and develope
ment of Barbourville and com
munity. This is the only bank
in existence named after its pre
sident, who is the oldest and one
of the most honored bankers in
the country. It is one of the
few banks that stood the panic
under President Cleveland's ad
ministration, as well as all subse
quent panics, without the least
inconvenience, never having oc
casion, during those trying times
to issue scrip in lieu of currency.

Corporations Forbidden
to Contribute to Cam
paign Funds.
The new election law in Ken
tucky provides heavy penalties
against all persons and Corpora
tions who contribute to campaign
funds, to be used for any unlaw
ful purpose and provides that
Corporations and their agents
and persons in charge of their
business cannot under any cir
cumstances contribute any money
or other thing of value, or prom
ise to do so, o aid any candidate
in any race for nomination and
election, and to do so subjects
the Corporations to a large fine,
and the individual agent or serv
ant of the Corporation to heavy
jail sentence as well as fine, and
in case it happens to be the At
torney of the Corporation, sub
jects him to disbarment in addi
tion to the other penalties. The
Act also provides that no candi
date for the nomination and elec
tion as Judge of the Kentucky
Court of Appeals shall expend or
have expended for him, alto
gether exceeding the su:n of
$3000.00. To make this Act ef
fective and prevent the interfer
ence of Corporations in elections,
it is provided that the Grand
Jury in each county shall have
full power to investigate any vio
lation of this Act, and may com
pel any Corporation, Company or
Association to produce the books,
correspondence or papers which
may show or tend to show any
violation of this Act, and may
compel any officer, agent, em
plee, custodian or other person
having the possession of any
uich books, correspondence or
capers o other evidence materi
al to the matter under investiga
tion, to appear and testify, and
in case of the failure or refusal,
he shall suffer a fine of not ex
ceeding one thousand dollars, oi
imprisonment not exceeding one
year.
The act is very broad and cov
ers every phase of fraud in elec
tions. It is intended to prevent
Corporations and moneyed inter
ests of the State from interfer
ing with elections, or attempting
to control nominations. This

PREPAREDNESS.
We can see by reading in nearly
every newspaper that a great
question is confronting this Na
tion, it is "Shall we increase our
Army and Navy?"
A few persons say that we
should not, to do so would give
us a stride toward militarism and
these same ones say that we
should rely upon our volunteers
and militia. But George Wash
ington, who was in command of
the American Army during the
revolution, knew the short
comings of the unorganized
militia and voluntnor sokers,
for in his meoSa;e tj t . ..;ress
Jan. 1790 he called attention to
the importance of the military
education of the youth and of
taking under control by the
National Government of the
training and discipline of the
Militia.
If. we look to Europe for an
object lesson, there are just two
ways of military training that is
worth considering The German
way, which was so trained that
it swept the war beyond its
borders during the first few days
of the war and hostilities, and
though they have encountered
superior numbers they are still
on foreign soil. Then there is
the British way, which its latest
acts of valor has been to aban
don the Dardanelles after ex
pending hundreds of millions of
dollars and nearlv 500,000 men
killed, wounded and ruined by
disease. The facts are this:
Germany was prepared, and the
British Army through no fault
of its own was not prepared.
Which kind of Preparedness
do we want - the kind that
slights our General staffs; the
kind that does not lay up sup
plies of munitions for adequate
defense; the kind of army that
is under-manned and under
officered, or the kind that has no
air ships for scout work?
Let it be a large army or a
