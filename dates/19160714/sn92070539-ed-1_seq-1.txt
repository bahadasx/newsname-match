to feel qualified to tell of every
detail and hope and fear in con
ueutlon with the 'aviation situa
tion," as the puiiers call it.
Therefore the Courier will con
tent itself with telling something
of the achievements of some of
the officers of the corps a corps
which U a brave and hard-work
Ing set of heroic Americans, so
modest that their achievements
are little known.
Captain 13. D. Foulois is in
command of aviation at this the
most important station of aero
nautical work and much of the
success in the overcoming of dif
tlculties caused by various con
ditions, particularly altitude and
heat, Is the result of his enter
prise, and .his grasp of tile needs
of the service. A service that
during this expedition is still
somewhat in the experimental
stage, for all the experience in
aviaMon at sea level is of little
use when the atmospheric con
ditions of dexert r.nd high alti
tude ure encountered.
Among the most picturesque
figures of the Aero Squadron are
Lieut. E S. (Jon ell and Lieut.
Uaugue, for they early in April
last broke the record lor cross
:ountry and nonstop Hying
with one passenger, wresting the
record for this work from the
notable Stephen MaeGordon, a
Curtis aviator of New Yark. The
highest altitude reached on this
memorable llight was 7,800 feet
above the peaks of the Sle-ra A"
Las Etouelas, which is really
about 11,1100 feet above sea level
A greater altitude could have
beep attained, but that the hands
of the pilot became almost use
less from cold.
Five days later Lieut Dargue
was ogam the heio of an advun
ture, but not a happy one, for,
with Capt. II. H. Willis, of South
Carolina, as observer, to avoid
iwsslble destruction ol the aero
plane he was driving through n
mountain pass, he tried to rise,
but the engine lacked the ,fpep'
necessary to respond to the sug
gestion of the pilot, so the filers
were smashed on to a ledge of
nick, falling a considerable dis
tan co with the machine, which
was destroyed, and the aviators
were badly bruised. They had a
terrible experience in a two
days' tramp before they reached
help, and Capt. Willis was in
hospital and Lieut. Dargue on
sick leave also for a long time
after their borrowing experi
ence.
Lieut. Gorrell has had enougl
adventures to furnish many a
reel "movie thriller" In the suf
fering and narrow escapes from
death in which he has been chief
actor since the expedition Into
Mexico began.
Captain T. F. Dodd is also a
brilliant flier, and has succeeded

Commercial Hotel
Will Soon be Finished
Several Subttantial Buildings Under
Course of Construction. Town
Begins to Look More Like a City.
The New Commercial Hotel is
being rapidly molded into form,
and will soon be ready for occu
pancy if the weather man ier
mlts. A large number ol work
men ure being kept on the job,
and the brickwork and also the
carpenter v ork is being done This
building will be modern In every
respect, and will have Its own
water system, a well for the pur
pose of supplying water having
been drilled.
Sam Ravel, the owner, was the
greatest loser In the raid, but he
has not been discouraged at all,
and is very enthusiastic in re
gard to the future of Columbus.
He has always been ready and
willing to assist in any enter
price that was for the benefit of
the community, and the I act that
le is giving Columbus such a
building as the New Commercial
will be proves his faith in the
Lower Mimbres. ,
The Evans Garage is another
building that is nearing com pie
tion, and Is far better that the
average building that has been
constructed in Columbus since
the Villa visit. Several other
buildings have been creeled, and
are now ueing ouui, anu mat
part of the town is growing very
rapidly.
A visit to Tart Street in the
early part of the evening sure
reminds one of being In a city.
This street is thronged itb the
crowds every night until late,
and all the available space has
been bought or leased. In some
instances vacant lots are renting
for as high as $50 per month.
Chautauqua Closed Thursday
The series of entertainments
given here by the Western Chau
tauqua System closed Thursday
evening with one of the best
shows ever seen in Columbus.
The Parsons sisters, violinists,
and Miss Mary Owsley, vocal
soloist, with the other members
of the Vivian Newkirk Harmony
Company, are sure some enter
tainers, and those who were
present on this last entertain
ment certainly enjoyed the
treat.
Every show was good, and it
i.s regretted that there was not a
larger number of citizens and
soldiers take advantage of them.
The visit of tills Chautauqua
system was not a financial suc
cess, the guarantors having to
put up about $200. Everyone
who attended were well pleased,
and hope that wo may be able to
induce the company to return
next year.

Happy Men from "The Hub"
Enjoy Baked Beans, Brown
Bread and Brains.
One of the much enjoyed and
unique events of this week was a
''Boston Breukfa.it," in honor of
the newspaper men who have
come to Columbus, N. M., with
the 2nd Mass. Infantry of the
National Guards.
"Dad" telephoned to Demlng
for the brown bread "like mother
back in Boston used to make "
and it was worth the forty miles
truck train trip to be so much
enjoyed.

Must Go Deeper For Water.
The well on the land of A. L.
Taylor, which has been leased by
the government did not furnish
the necessary amount of water
and must be sunk deeper. It had
been drilled to a depth of 216 feet
and It was t hougth that an ample
supply of water had been en
countered. The drilling was
stopped and a test was made, but
it did not furnish the necessary
amount, and the driller, E. J
Fulton, is now going deeper.
It seems that preparations are
being made for the troops to re
main here indeflninely, They
have taken a lease on this prop
erty, which adjoins the townslte
on the north-west, and have al
ready erected a 12,000 gallon tank
on a thirty foot tower, and have
made arrangements with Mr
Fulton for the drilling of three
more wells. According to our
best information the camp
grounds being prepared on this
section is not for the troops now
stationed here, but for others
that are yet to come.
This will make an ideal camp
for the soldiers, it is higher than
the old camp, and is well drained
In the ra n.v season. The soil is
such that it will nut became mud

The following coses were heard
in Justice of the Peace Peache's
court this week: II. E. Pringle,
F. A. Hall. Jake Ballard, W. T.
Ritchie, J. D. Phillips, Bert Alex
ander, J. J. McLaughlin, Enrl
Herron and Joe Grady were
charged with selling booz without
license. Herron and Grady
were bound over to await the ac
tion of the grand jury in the sum
of $1,000. Pringle and Hall were
given an opportunity to make a
$1,500 bond or await the action of
the October grand jury In the
Demlng jal! J D. Phillips, Bert
Alexander and J. J. McLiughlin
were bound over in $2,000 bond.
Jake Ballard and W. T. Ritchie
were acquitted.
J. R Lorton and Chas. R. Fin-
nigan were charged with dis
orderly conduct and were fined
$5. each and costs. Joe Grady
and W. M. Eld ridge were each
assessed a Une of $10 for gambl
ing. F. L. Brown, Robert Gentle
W. S. Brown and Harry Lloyd
were given 60 days in the county
jail for vagrancy, but were given
an opportunity to get out of town.
Moseley was required to contri
bute $25 and cost on a similar
charge. Russell Trilby was
charged with the theft of an army
pistol and for carrying same con
cealed. He was fined $50 and
given IK) days in the county jail.
Sheriff Simpson was down
Monday and proceeded to make
general clean up among those
who persist in violating the laws,
and as a resultof his visit several
cases were brought before Judge
Peach. D. J. Coadborne, deputy
herlff, and Jack Thomas, chief
of police, are on the job almost
day and night, and those who do
step over the bounds of the law
are generaly picked up and
prosecuted. Considering the
number of people here the crim
inal docket has been very light,
possibly lighter than any town
you can find with the like number
f people, and the larger part of
the criminals are charged with
elllng whiskey.
Dentists Visit Columbus.
Dr. Artiiur E. Smith, of the
Medical and Dental Department
of the Chicago University, who
has been giving a series of lec
tures in Albuquerque; Dr.Moran
of Demlng; Dr. R. H. Gudger,of
Silver City, and Dr. E. M. Brady
formerly of Uolumbus, came
down here Sunday for a short
visit. They wore over for dinner
with the Officers of the New
Mexico National Guard, return
ing to Demlng by auto late in the
evening.
Long Dry Spell Broken
The weather man finally gav
in, and several good showers of
rain fell first of the week.gthe
first rain since May 1st. The
grass was beginning to get very
dry, and some of the range
stock was suffering, some of the
cattle men reporting heavy
losses. From now on for twi
or three months plenty of rai
can be expected, and all know
that It always brings plenty of
good grass.

Should Have an El
Paso-Columbus Road
Would Shorten Distance Between
Two Towns 50 Miles or More
and Affect a Great Saving.
The need of a direct highway
rom ei I'aso to ijoiumous is
growing more apparent every
day, In fact those who have mpde
the trip In auto during the past
two or three months could have
more than saved enough in gaso
line and wear and tear on their
machines to have built such a
road. The Government trucks
which have been brought from El
Paso to the base at Columbus
could have been sent over the
proposed route at a saving pos-
Ibly equal to the cost of the road.
Puring the past three or four
years the troops have been on
the border, the route along the
boundary line has been traveled
extensively, and in ordinary times
the trip can be made in near half
the time that it can be made by
going around by Demlng. On
account of some sand a few miles
west of El Paso it is not a feasible
way to mute automobiles unless
some work is done. With a small
amount of work this route could
be put in first class shape.
By keeping the Borderland for
about ten miles west of El Paso
and then turning south-west to
the road which has been traveled
by the troops, about 50 miles
distance would be saved.
Douglas has been trying for
some time to get a change made
in the Borderland route, Keeping
the road true to it" name, and
the matter is being taken up with
the Chamber of Commerce of
Douglas, and also Ei P.io and is
being brought to the attention of
the army officials It would not
be necessary to make a change
in the Borderland but build the
road and give tourists and any
one who wibh to make the trip
the opportunity o f traveling
either road.
Fire Protection for Columbus
A representative of a chemical
fire engine manufacturing com
pany has been in town during
this week, and has sold the citi
zens two chemical fire engines.
The board of trustees did not
think tiiey had money enough to
take up the proposition, and the
money has been raised by popu
lar subscription. The machines
purchased, it is claimed by the
manufacturers, have a fire Hunt
ing charge that is equal to 0,000
pails of water, andean be quickly
reloaded at small expense.
It would seem that In this
climate that a tire engine of this
design would better meet the
requirements of Columbus than
a machine that must depend en
tlrely on the water sui ply. The
new wat rworks will bo com
pleted soon, and while the pres
sure will not be as strong as
should be the tire insurance
without doubt will be lowered
enougl; to pay the expense of the
water system and also the tire
engines within a very short
time.
Bridge Contract Signed
Chas. Heath, senior member
of the Luna County Road Board,
this week signed the contract
with the El Paso Bridge Co. for
the construction of the steel
bridge across the arroya in the
gap. The material for this bridge
site, and the work will be com
pleted by September 1st, or
sooner. With ho completion of
this bridge a first class highway
will be opened between ColumbuB
and the county seat.
The graders have been busy on
this road for over one month,
but on account of the dry
weather no roads have been
thrown open for traflia. Now
gramme.
