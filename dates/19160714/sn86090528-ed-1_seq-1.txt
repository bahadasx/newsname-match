BRIDGE FOR
FOURTH ST.

Like Sum is Given by Grady County

Structure
A $0,000 concrete bridge across
line creek at Fourth street is destin
ed to become one of the earliest Im
provements of the city of Chickasha,
provided the county will share half

This has been agitated for some
time by Mayor Coffman and Street
Commissioner Beets and the item of
$",000 was inserted in the budget for
the coming year, subject to the Bp-
ivroval of the city council. It was not
removed after quite a lengthy discus

Coffman explained that he had con

Pioners and had been assured that the
matter would be given favorable con

as the city expressed a desire to act.

propriate the city's share, provided a
like appropriation be made hy the
comity. On motion of Councilman
Canenian a committee will be appoint
ed by Mayor Coffman to get a defi
nite understanding with, the county
board.
For several mouths the bridge at
Fourth and Michigan avenue bus been
a source of grief to city officials. Ow
ing to its weakened condition ,.ffic.
tonnage has been considerably reduc
ed of late and Commissioner Beets
recently cut down the width of the
thoroughfare for vehicles four feet in
order thut the strain might not be
" oine peril to the public. A new
deck was also add.J by the street
commissioner.

ceshful assault at tuc rsulr meeting
of the council last night. ' r
Vlneo points were distludiy
brought out in the interesting discus,
sloti which was introduced during tht
consideration, o! the budget for the
:niing year: First, that th lotal
odd Fellows are In no condition to
continue to maintain the cemelory in
a 'iintiuer befitting an InatitaUoo v.t
tuis kind for a city of 15,OW, but', at
toe rame time would profit OotfcStig
In any Cenl which might bs coisutm

second, that under the present rnijfli
tions the ladies of the cemetery Bso
ci.ition, however good their Intentions,
or however zealous they may be in
their efforts to make the grounds at
tractive, are powerless to do so with
out substantial aid from the citf;
tMrd, tnat the laws of OklahomE em
power the city to levy a tax not ft
eeiiiiig one-half mill ou bo (1 ir
ctiuv'o;; of city property for the pBf-rliu.-e
at d maintenance of a n) liij'ci.-ia I
cem'cry.
Burden Is too Great.
The burden of maintenance by 2.10
members of the fraternal ordor could
better be borne by 4 city of 15,000, by
which it could be undertaken without
any hardships or embarrassment. Mr.
Barefoot did not believe that an fcxtnt
tax levy wc.tld be necessary for the
accomplishment of thia purpose, but
reminded the council that a levy of
one-fourth mill would produce tl" SO,
while only $1,000 annually would be re
quired as a guarantee of all necessary
expenses and considerable less than
that sum would actually bu drawn
from the city treasury to supplement
the sales of lots and of other reve
nues, which are constantly being pro
duced. He estimated the salary of a
sexton at $i;o a month and the addi
tional cost of upkeep should come wtll
within the thousand dollars.
Board of Trustees.
Ill the event of its purchase by tb
City the affairs of the cemetery sooiild
legally come under the jurisdiction of
a board of trustees consisting of three
persons, with terms ranging from two
to six years, lots being drawn tor the
two. four and six year terms after the
selection of the board is made by the
coum il. .V town of the site of Cblck

were concerned. 1 uey aaiceu uu -vois
nor were they peeking any advan

better way to handle the property f.nd
when takdi over by the city the ladies
would have ways of rabinf money
