CAUSES OF PRESENT PROSPERITY
The Democratic party would like
very much to mako it appear that the
Wilson administration is lc.sponsihle
for present business conditions. The
reporlfl of tho federal government to
tally disprove such a claim. The otinr
mwis crops of last year added approx
imntely !C,00,0()0,000 more to tho nn'
tional wealth and circulation than did
the crops of J014. That, in itself, was
noogh to make a vast difference in
relative prosperity. Neither Mr. Wil
son, nor Mrf Wilson's policies, in
lluenced agricultural production, ul
though tho Democrats are disposed to
take credit for it. Hut figures just
published by the department of com
nierce prove beyond all question that
it is the wnr trade ami the war trade
alone that has expanded our foieign
commerce inr bevond all previous
records and has mado tho country rich
er by many hundreds of millions.
In tilts report the exports and ha
ports of 191.1, 1914 and 191." aro pro
seated by countries. The total ex
ports in 191.1 wero $2,481,000,000; in
1914, $3,547,000,000, nn incroase of $1
ub.i,uui),uuu. All of tins increase, am
more, is shown by tho report to bo .duo
to tho salo of war munitions nnd sup
piles. Our cxportB to Kngland . wero
increased- by $577,000,000, to Franco.
by $?fto;6do;6oo; ''ti riia!y fi)2;orjo;-T
000, to Ilussin by $1.19,000,000, mak
ing a total increase to tho allied coun
tries of $1,218,000,000. To tho coun
tries bordering upon tho wnr zone
Holland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark,
Orecce and Switzerland our cxprts
increased $218,000,000, all of which is
duo to abnormal demand growing out
of wnr. To supposo thnt our normal
trndo with these countries could bo in
creased ia tho least under present con
ditions is ninnifestjly nbsurd. There
fore wo have a total gain in exports re
sulting from the wnr, of $1,460,000,-
000, as compared with 191.1. Against
this wo hnvo a loss, consequent upon
tho war, of $1181,000,000 to Oermany
and Belgium, making 11 not gain from
this cause of $l,08.'i,000,000. Our ex-
ports to tho rest of the world have do
creased $22,000,000.
Our imports in 19LI iimuunted to $1,-
792,000,000; in 1915 to $1,778,000,000.
Our balance of trade, therefore, in
1915, was $1,709,000,000. Directly or
indiiectly tho countiy is that much
richer; wo have sold to foreign na
tions that much 111010 than wo have
bought from them. Tho wnr brought
us in 1915 an average of ovor $17 per
capita for the entire population of tho
United States. Klimiuutiug the sales
to the allies and tho border nations
our balance of trade iu 11)15 is seen
to bo only $.10:1,000,000. Our balance
of trade in 191JI was $092,000,000, So
it is apparent that, outside of war
sales, wo have lost almost $100,000,
000. It is quite plain from these oflleial
figures thnt every dollar of our gain
from foreign commerce is duo to tho
war demand, and that tho war and the
crops have given us a prosperity not
because of but iu spite of the Demo
cratic administration.
At any rate Carranza deserves somo
thanks for opening tho eyes of tho nn
tion to tho country's utter hick of pre
paredness for defense, oven ngnlnst
such nn insignificant foe as Mexico. Ho
has started tho United States 011 thy
real road to preparedness, for it is not
to bo believed thnt public sentiment
will put up witli tho ninke-shlfts that
have been offered, or that the tho ob
structionlsts in congress will dnro to
contlnuo their opposition to adequate
measures for natimml defense.

commemoration of the 150th uunl-

of the 12i,th anniversary of tho stnto
to the union and tho fidth anniversary
of granting a charter to their busy
illngo. A special town meeting has
been called for Saturday afternoon to
mako nn appropriation for tho celebra
tion. That Vermont is greatly favored
this year is shown by the last report
of crop conditions issued by the United
States department of .agriculture. This
report shows many encouraging nivl
satisfactory things, among others thnt
Vermont lends every stnto in condi
tion of hay, with a percentage of 110,
compnrod with a percentngn of 90.1
for tho United Stntos as a whole. Ver
mont lends in condition of nlfalfa,
with a percentage of 105, is tied with
New Hampshire for first place in con
ilition of clover, with a percentage ot
102, nnd is tied with New Hampshire
for first place in condition of pasture,
witli a percentage of 109. Vermont nl
so holds first place in condition of np
pies, pears and field berries, with n
percentage in ench instance of 100,
compared with a perceatngo for the
United States of 70 for apples, 00.2
for pears and S8.2 for field berries.
Nature is good to Vermont, surely.
THE WONDERFUL DEUTSCIILAND.
First Merchant Submarine Brought
Valuablo Cargo from Germany to
to Baltimore.
The sensation of the week in naval
and shipping circles was tho arrival
at Baltimore Monday of the Oerman
merchant submarine Deutschland, af
ter a passage of -10 days from Brcm
mer Haven. The ship, carrying a crew
of 29 men under the leadership of
Capt. Kocnig, brought a cargo of 750
tons of valuable chemicals and dye-
stuffs. On the return voynge, which
will be stnrted within a few davs, tho
Deutschland will carrv back nickel and
rubbor supplies, which are sorely need
ed in Germany.
Tho Deutschland is the first mer
chnnt submnrino over put into service,
and tho success of tho vessel in clud
ing tho English and French cruisers i
regarded as n wonderful performance
It ia well known thnt for months
British .and French warships wore w-
trolling' .tho American e'oiist, ', hrfvin'g
particularly In yicty the capturo-'ofj hn'
German ships attempting .to' enter
Chesapeake bay.
The Deutschland is a craft 250 foot
long by about 25 beam. Sho was not
loaded" to full capacity. Capt. Kocn
ig says she traveled only 90 miles
under water, but that he could have
kept below the surface four dnys nt a
time if his ship had been in danger.
It is claimed that the Germans hnvo
another vessel similar to tho Deutsch
land already on her wav to this coun
try and that a Meet of such vessels
will soon be in operation, showing that
tho British blockade is ineffectuul.
Tim British and French representa
tives ia Washington asked tho Ameri
can authorities to determine the status
of tho Deutschlnnd, but an examina
tion showed that the ship was un
armed, carried no weapons except four
revolvers in possession of the olucers,
and that tho crew consisted of '.sailors
not connected witli the Oerman nnvy.
OARRANZA'S REPLY ACOErTED.
Friendly Relations Now Existing Be
tween United States and Do Facto
Government of Mexico.
A note formally accepting Gen. Car
ranza 's proposal that the differences
between the United States and the do
facto government of Mexico bo set
tled by direct negotiations was handed
Friday to Klisco Arreudondo, tho am
bassador designato in Washington. It
must first lie mnde clear thnt Car
ranza 's own troops can take up tho
task which Pershing's forces wero
sent to perform. There is nothing in
tho noto to indicate an immediate
withdrawal of the American soldieis
from Mexico. The nffnirs between tho
two countries, from a diplomatic
standpoint, are regarded as friendly.
It is probable that jhe embargo on all
supplies except arUis and munitions
will be raised sooii. There nro im
mense quantities of goods on tho bor
der which have been held up the past
fow weeks.
There have been no disturbances on
tho border recently. Hoports have
been received of ' u battle between
Villa adherents and Carrnnza soldiers
south of I'arral. A despatch was sent
out stutlug that Villa wns moving
toward tho border with a force of
2,000 men, but this lins been sinco
discredited.
