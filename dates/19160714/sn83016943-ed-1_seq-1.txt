NEGOTIABLE PAPER ACT
New Law in Effect Relating to Com
mercial F apart
Mississippi's new negotiable in
ctru incuts act went into elTect
July 0, ami is now a part ami
parcel of the laws of the common
wealth.
The new chapter on negotiable
instruments, oi.e of the longest
enacted at the recent legislative
session, makes some radical
changes in the old laws applicable
to commercial paper.
For instance, here's something
that will be sad news to the fel
lows who are not prompt in meet
ing their notes on the date when
due:
Suppose you owe Bill Smith
$100, and have given your note
in payment for same, payable at
some designated bank.
If Bill knows you have money
on deposit in the bank he's not
going to worry about whether
you are going to pay that $100
note. Xot a bit of it. Bill will
simply take that note to the
bank and have it cashed, just like
it was a check. The bank is com
pelled to pay it out of the funds
you have on deposit, providing
they are sufficient to caucel the
principal and interest.
Auother effect of the new law
will be to require banking in
stitutions to close at the noon
hour on Saturday.
The negotiable instruments act
was framed by State Senator Mur
ray of Warren county. Its pur
pose is to make the Mississippi
laws relative to all forms of com
mercial paper conform to the uni
forra nogotiable instruments
statutes ot other states. xU
states in the Union, with but tvo
or three exceptions, have enacted
this law.
Here are some of the provisions
of the new law that should be
carefully studied by all business
men:
"Every negotiable instrument
is payable at the time fixed there
in wiihnnt irraep. When t,hf d:i v
... o- J
I of maturity falls on Sunday o'- a
holiday, the mstijinciu id pay
able on the next succeeding busi
ness day. Instruments falling
due or becoming payable on Sat
urday are to be presented for pay
ment on the next succeeding busi
ness day, except that instruments
iavable on demand mav at the
I J v
option of the holder, be presented
, before 12 o'clock noon on Satur
day when that entire day is not
a holiday."
"An instrument is payable on
jdemaud where it is expressed to
be payable on demand, or at sight,
or on presentation, or in which
io time for payment is expressed."
1 Notes do not bear three days of
'grace. Sight and demand drafts
may not be accepted as formerly;
'! they will bear only such grace as
they specify, for example, "One
day after sight," or
davs sicht." When
a draft is
i payable after sight or a note falls
( Jue on Sunday or a holiday it is
( payable on the next business day
i lollowiug; and when due on Sat
urday the payer has the option
(if deferrinc payment until Mon-
y )dav for. if Monday is a holiday
until the next business day lol-
lowing), but this option in re
J. f garU. W piipfl uJiHumig uu odiui-
drafts presented before 12 o'clock
that day.
"The drawee is allowed twenty-
J four hours after presentment in
('which to decide whether or not
he will accept the bill (of ex
'change), but the acceptance it
IVCil Ueiev.3 ui wv f -j
Mutation."
This applies to drafts payable
after sight, not to drafts payable
ion demand. If the draft is pres
ented on the 8th of the month,
say, the person on whom it is
drawn may wait unui me :un io
idecide whether he will accept it,
but if he accepts it alter this
ilelay his acceptar.ee must be
elated as the 8th.
jLf "Where the instrument is
lade payable at a oauK it is
univalent to an order to the
xink to pay the same for the ac-
ount of the principal ueutor
hereon."
That is. if a person signs a note
Jn f.ivnr of another person (or a
Dfirm or organization) and makes
'i n,-QKU at thp hank where he
V'eps his account, the holder of
fhe note may present it at the
ank named ou due date ana n
,he person WRQ gignra uiv w
sufficient fumls and ha not
;;iven a stop-payment order the
bank must pay the note and
charge it to his (the signer's" ac
count, find is not reiuired to ob
tain his consent before doing so.
"Where the instrument con
tains or the person adds to his
signature words indicating that
he signs for or on behalf of a prin
cipal, or in a representative ca
pacity, he is not liable on the in
strument if he was dulv author
ized, but the mere addition of
words describing him as agent, or
as filling a representative char
acter, without-, disclosing his prin
cipal, does not exempt him from
personal liability."
A bona tide agent or representa
tive is not personally liable on an
instrument he signs, but if a per
son signs as agent in an attempt
to evade personal liability and
can not prove that he signed for a
principal under due authority, he
is personally liable.
"Where an instrument contain
ing the words 'I promise to pay'
is signed by two or more persons,
they are deemed to be jointly and
severally liable thereon."
"An accommodation party is
one who has signed the instru
ment as maker, drawer, acceptor
or endorser, without receiving
value thereof, and for the purpose
of lending his name to some other
person. Such a person is liable
on the instrument to a holder for
value, notwithstanding such
holder at the time of taking the
instrument knew him to bo only
an accommodation party."
"Where there is a coullict be
tween the written and printed
provisions of the instrument the
written provisions prevail."
"Where the sura payable is ex
pressed in words and also in
ligures and there is a discrepancy
between the two the sum denoted
by the words is the sum payable:
but if the words are ambiguous
or uncertain references may be
had to the figures to lix the
amount.
Came Law To Be Referred
Secretary of State J. W. Power
has issued a proclamation declar
ing the petition to refer the
Richardson game and fish law
tothe people for ratification or
rejection, under the initiative and
referendum amendment to the
State Constitution, to be suffi
cient, and calling attention to
the fact that it is held in abey
ance until the general election
in November.
The "Secretary of state would
have taken the same action on
the petitions to refer the Weak
Icy (juart-at-a-time whiskey bill,
and the anti advertising law
prohibiting the advertising of
beer and whiskey, but for the
fact that prohibition leaders ob
tained an injunction against his
doing so at this time.
However, it is asserted that if
the petitions on one law hold
gooi they necessarily must be
valid as toother laws, and if the
prohibitionists succeed in knock
ing out the initiative and refer
endum amendment it would
affect the game law just as any
other.
It became known recently that
before the legislators inserted
into the constitutien'the initiative
and referendum amendment they
consulted the highest authorities
in the state regarding the ques
tion of the legality of its adop
tion by the people, and all au
thorities held that unquestiona
bly the people had voted to pro
vide a means whereby they could
ratify or reject any statute
passed at the session of the leg
islature inserting the amend
ment, or thereafter.
It is claimed that the whole
purpose of the prohibitionists in
swearing out the injunction was
to keep the voters from express
ing themselves at the polls on
the subject of drastic and what
many people claim is discrimin
atory . legislation. However,
steps will be taken at once to
have the injuction considered ut
terly worthless, by lawyers of
note, dissolved, w hen the secre
tary of state probably will issue
proclamations calling for a vote
of the people tm the measures.

teeth in childhood menace adult

The Submarine Merchantman
Arrival at Baltimore of the sub
marine "merchantman" IVutscli
land, from Bremen, scores an
other victory for (lei man ingenui
ty and resourcefulness. More
than a month ago reports were
published on both sides of the
Atlantic that (lerniany was plan
ning to send a submarine cargo
boat to America and that the ves
sel would reach an American port
during the early part of July. It
develops that the Peutsehland
cleared from Bremen on June 11
last, but spent some days at
Helgoland awaiting a favorable
chance to "run" the . Allied
blockade. The trans oceanic voy
age consumed only about sixteen
days and was made with compari.
tive ease and safety, notwith
standing the fore-notices pub
lished in enemy and injutral news
papers. The Deutschland is said to be
laden with d vest nil's, conserva
tively valued at .:l,000,()0O. She
will take out nickel and crude
rubber, the outbound cargo hav
ing been stored in Baltimore ware
houses to await her arrival. For
reasons readily understood, no
"sailing date'' has been an
nounced. 2s ow that the Allied
block aders and patrols have
learned the whereabouts of this
novel "merchantman," the leturn
voyage will be more difficult than
the voyage across, and the
I X-utsch land's skipper will natur
ally keep the hour of his depart
ure a profound secret.
The Deutschland's" arrival may
be welcomed by Americans for
two reasons. It gives us oppor
tunity to demonstrate that our
markets are open to all coiners,
and it affords indirect but posi
tive assurance that the. (ierman
babies are not, r'r.er ail, suffering
awful privation j,r. hardship by
the rigors of u blockade which
cuts ol f heir nvtk supply. The
cpy-rrt ' i'i .'hst'u of th" "nn
babies touched many Auk. lean
hearts and was very industrious
ly circulated the country over.
With tin? announcement from Bal
timore that the submarine cargo
boat will load for Bremen not
milk, but nickel and crude rub
bei', eonii'S a dispatch from Wash
ington transmitting an official re
port from the American embassy
at Berlin, which denies positively
that the (ierman children "are
staning bi cause of lack of milk
and other nutritive foods." On
the contrary, the report declares,
Ierman chiidred "hae presented
during recent months a condition
of health and a reduction in
death rate not present since the
beginning of the war." Times.

Some Wilson Advantages
The administration has the ad
vantage over its opponents of a
record of practical conduct and
effort to point to. It has had a
heavy responsibility in a critical
period, and on the whole has
borne it with' marked success
considering its difficulties. It is
altogether doubtful whether any
otner man at the head of the gov
ernment with a cabinet of his
own choice, would have done
better or been subject to less
priticism than President Wilson.
Much stress is probably laid up
on service in behalf of peace,
while the blood of the people
was stirred by the excitement of
war and the possibility of en
tanglement with the belligerents
whose activity necessarily inter
fered with neutral rights and
obligations. The diplomatic
record of the administration in
this severe and prolonged exig
geney has been such as to com
mand confidence. This should
oot be treated as in any sense a
partisan matter, but can hardly
be helped being weighed in favor
of the administration with think
ing people, and with those who
aro instinctively in favor of fair
judgment. The opponents of!, the
administrations would do well
not to underestimate the ad
vantage of this to the party in
power. It will be difficult to
oner convincing reasons ior a
change, and there will be a feel
ing averse to shifting to a new
course not tested by experience.
New ork Journal of Com-
Fi 1
me
desires to remind the public that the recent Mississippi
Legislature passed THE UNIFORM NEGOTIABLE
INSTRUMENTS ACTS-or an act to make uniform
the law concerning commercial paper this act hav
ing been previously passed by practically every other
State in the Union.
This law became effective ninety (90) days af
ter its passage and was therefore operative begin
ning July 6lh, 1916; and the following are a few of
the salient clauses in which the business public is
daily concerned :
The Customary three days of grace
is now abolisned from all instruments.
Sec. 85. (Time of Maturity) Every Negotiable
Instrument Is Payable at the Time Fixed Therein
Without Grace.
Paper maturing on Sunday or a holiday is now
payable on the next succeeding business day instead
of on the day previous as heretofore.
Sec. 85 When the day of maturity falls on Sun
day, or a holiday, the instrument is payable on the
next succeeding business day. Instruments falling
due on Saturday are to be presented for payment
oii the next succeeding business day, except that in
struments payable on demand may, at the option of
the holder, be presented for payment before twelve
o'clock noon on Saturday when that entire day is
not a holiday.
A very important innovation is the new rule
where a note or instrument is payable at a bank.
In the future a note made payable at a given bank
is in effect the same as a check on the bank, or vir
tually an order on the bank to pay note at maturity.
Sec. 87. When the instrument is made payable
at a bank, it is equivalent to an order to the bank
to pay the same for the account of the principal
debtor thereon.

Russia Revives
A year ago the Russian
armies were reeling back across
Galkia, across Poland, across
Coi.rland and Lithuania, broken
and beaten by the tremendous
artillery assaults of Mackenson
and Ilindcnburg. One by ore
the fortresses they held were
captured Przemysl, Lembcrg,
Warsaw, Novogeorgievsk, Ivan
gorod, Grodno, Kovno, Hrest-
Litovsk, vima. Their retreat!
was skillful; the armies of the
Grynd Duke were never crushed
or forced to surrender; but a
good many persons believed
their defeat to be so complete
that they would not be able to
undertake another formidable
offensive. Iut within the year
the armies have been rebuilt
from the inexhaustible reserves
of Russia, guns and ammunition
have been found in sufficient
quantity - and the Russians are
again advancing.
If we are to believe the reports
that come from Petrograd, the
Ru.- -ian drive in Volhynia and
Pukowir.a took in a fortnight
mon: prisoners than the Ger-
ina.i-) uxin. in a cuwuhpuii'iuifc;;
peri i of their drive last sum-
mer and as much spoil. Lutsk,
Austrian line, wnicn riaq appar
ently been seriously weakened
to carry on the offensive against
Italy and to support the German
campaign at Verdun, was crum
pled at severel points by General
Brusiloff's attacks, Germany
had mce more to send help to its
ally at a time when it needed all
its strength elsewhere. The
Autrir.n offense against Italy
gtjpr,ed, Again Russia had
erchants and
B
aimers
toome to the relief of its western
Allies, as it came when the Ger
man armies were striking hard
! at Pans in August, two years
ago,
I'-y themselves the Russians
are not likely to win back all
that the Teutons took from them
last year. They hope to drive
the Austrians back into Galicia,
to capture Lemberg and perhaps
Praemysl, and thereby to com
pel the German armies in the
north to give ground. Put the
Austrian and the Germans are
probably too well prepared with
guns and ammunitioa to permit
Prusiloff to win a victory that
will equal that of Mackensen
and Ilindcnburg.
On the other hand, if this ad
vance is only a first step in a co
ordinated offense on all the Allied
fronts, no one can predict what
may grow out of it. Py tht
time this is rea l, it w,P, probab
ly be clear whether it is the
(opening gun of the great Allied
campaign or merely a diversion
to relive tho hostile pressure at
Verdun and in the Trentino
and to show that the Central
Powers h i j not yet fought
their way to scdi a peace as
they desire. In any event it

Both of the great parties and
their platforms have decided in
favor of the appointment of
home people in the public ser
vice. This has always been a
Democratic principle, because in
the South at least w have
always had an abundant supply
of what was then called carpet
baggers, or people imported Ifom
other sections of the country
who held the public offices.
Home rule and home livinjj and
the conduet of home affaira by
home people is a sentiment
which is growing aad spreading
very rapidly, and it has found
expression in both platforms.
Bringing people from a diatance
and giving them appointments
in a community is a reflection
upon the residents of that com
munity whica is unmerited and
unjust. News-Scimitar.
Tobacco
Tobacco is a harmful weed, the
learned physicians tret agreed. It
Hiains the teeth and bites the tongue,
and injures larnx, heart and lungs, it
b(oili the whiskers, taints the breath,
and sends man to an early death, and
when he's laid beneath the sod, the
It Kal lights divide his wad. And yet if
tins pjnk weed were barred, wo d
find the sledding pre-tty hard, for in
one thing tobacco's blest, is that it
soothes the savage breast. And many
hufibands are serene, who would b
iju.irrelsorne and mean, indulging oft in
mental gripes, if you ahoukf tako
ftway their pipes. When I an smok
ing I'm as mild as anj gent that ever
t-milled, and folks who hear us chirp
and Meat, remark, "His temper Is so
sweet!" But when, impelled by aims
sublime, I cut out smoking for a time,
I'm sore as any growling bear that
mumules soupbones in its lair, and all
the women in the shack are hoping I
will soon get back to blowing smote
around my room, e'en though it means
an early tomb. Walt Mason.
