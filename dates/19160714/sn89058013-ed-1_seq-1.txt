AFTER TWENTY
.YEARS OF SERVICE
It is now but four weeks until
the Congressional' primary. It
goes without saying the Progress
never fails to find genuine pleasure
in the announcement that Mr. Sims
offers for reelection. We have not
" only been an observer of local con
ditions but we have keenly watched
the expressed sentiment throughout
wtbe Congressional District," and
noted with satisfaction that the vo
ter year after year becomes less ex
cited over the personal ambitions
of the candidates aud more con-
cerned over the service to be ren
dered and, with a growing tenden
cy, "to let well enough alone." '
When Mr. Porter made his an
nouncement to make this second
try-out as a Congressional candi
date, one tried to make a survey of
conditions as to his availability,
and, since we must judge things
by comparison, we tried to figure,
even giving him the benefit of
every doubt, in what way he could
be considered as a more formidable
candidate than was General How
ard two years ago. General How
ard was quite the equal if not the
i superior intellectually; a much old
er man with a broader experience;
he was a public official whose peo
ple had reelected him and kept him
iu office for more than twenty years
as Attorney General and no man,
especially one of General Howard's
temperament, could so long mix
with a people - without making
friends, and such friends as would
have and. exercise a personal inter
eat in his political fortunes. Out
side of Henry County there are
not 10 men of political strength
who have a personal interest in
Porter on Porter's account, for
t hose who are supporting him are
not specially for Porter but just
opposed to Congressman Sims.
General Howard is a more "lika
ble" man personally, a better "mix
er," as it is called.- He had a large1
personal acquaintance in eight of
the ten. counties of the district,
knowing practically every voter in
seven of ' the counties where he
bold court he knew I intimately
fifty times the number of voters
that does Porter; he had influential
relatives in five of the ten counties
of the district which gave . him a
strength Porter can not command.
He had an office to surrender in
event of his advancement to Con
- gr ess and from a political viewpoint
this was a valuable asset; yet with
alt this advantage as we see it in
li is favor ' as against Mr. Porter's
Availability, General Howard could
riot succeed against Mr. Sims, and
there was a reasonthe reason be
ing that the people felt that they
h nd in Congressman Sims a man
wholly equipped for the place, who
s t inda as high as any man in the
Congress of the United States, and
whose every effort aud attention1
hna been to serve ' the people of
this district. The one thing that;
Porter can Bay that General How
wd was estopped from using is, that
lin has never held office and be
lieves in rotation of public officials.
This is an argumentrbowever, that
appeals only to the few-the very
Jew that aspire to office, simply as
a? place for themselves in the gov
ernment service. The voter now
appreciates that it" takes tenure in
n-legislative body to get rank and
results,, aud the tendency every.
where is to keep the faithful repre
sentative just as long as he will
honestly serve them. During Mr.
Sims' long career he has never cast
a vote of which he is or was asham
ed, or for which it was necessary
for' him to apologize, nor has Mr.
Porter challenged a single act or
vote of Mr. Sims twenty years of
activity, sufficient of itself to re
elect the Congressman. ; ' "
Every vote he has cast has been
iu keeping with principle; he does
nothing for expediency or for show ;
he has none of the qualities of the
professional politician and shuns
notoriety and evades the press
agent. He is conferred with by
President Wilson in presenting the
administration measures and enjoys
the esteem and confidence of the
President and Congressional lead
ers. , ., - - '. .
, Our interest in Mr. Sims dates
back many years before he entered
public life. He can not boast that
one grandfather was a Governor
and the other a member of Congress
as does his opponent, but his grand
fathers were of the sturdy farmer
class who earned their living by
the sweat of their brow. Mr. Sims
had to make his own way in every
thing he has undertaken in life.
As a struggling young man he was
known to be so honorable and de
pendable that he had no difficulty
in getting friends tp lend him the
money to go to school and later as
a struggling young lawyer repaid
every obligation. He is conserva
tive in act and temperate in speech,
and especially now when the honor
of the country is being tried, do we
need that conservatism and balance
of which he is possessed. The dis
trict should be congratulated that
Mr. Sims offers for reelection and
our good fortune to have such a
man to be our Representative,
Lexington Progress.

LETS BOOST A
; CLEAN TOWN
We find a disposition among
some of Camden's citizens to put
the blame for the unsanitary and
unsightly condition of the town on
the Board of Mayor and Aldermen.
They overlook the fact that there
are no available funds for cleans
ing the town and that the present
officials cau not be held responsi
ble because they are new in har
ness.' They have also overlooked
another fact, that virtue and clean
liness can not be legislated into
people. .' ".
We seem to have gone mad on
the subject of demanding laws to
curb or cure this and that evil and
decidedly indifferent to enforcing
them. Camden has good sanitary
laws, but until we all join hands in
spreading the gospel of cleanliness
and getting right up behind the
Board of Health they will not be
enforced. We had an illustration
of this last year. 1
Responding to a call for that
purpose, the ladies of Camden met
and organized the Woman's Civic
Improvement League. Cleanli
ness, you know, is an instinct with
women which has survived in spite
of the fact that man is fundament
ally lazy and many are untidy.
With this idea in view, some of
our citizens who feel an interest in
the matter decided it would be
good policy to turn the town over
to the ladies.
The Chronicle took a keen inter
est in the league's organization, for
we felt at the time that it would
solve the problem of cleansing and
beautifying our town. But the
League Died Befobe Complet
ing its" Organization ! Why ?
The only plausible solution we
have. to offer-is, public sentiment
was overwhelmingly against it.
We make Jhis statement advisedly J
for we heard many cdmments on
the league, not one of which was
favorable to it; ,
Instead of pledging support and
encouraging the ladies, we heard
such comments as "She never saw
Will you?
Bank & Trust Go
a clean town," "Why did they elect
so and so?" "They needn't ask me
for money," etc. In reminding
you of these things it is just as
unpleasant for us to do so as it is
for you to read it. But you know
they are facts. ' -
As we have said heretofore, the
booster spirit of some men is lim
ited to a lot of noise and a big dis
play periodically, This is alright
as far as it goes, but, gentlemen, if
you want to boost something that
is really worth while at this time
in Camden, lets boost a Clean
Town for 365 days every year un
til Camden will look as neat and
tidy as Huntingdon, Lexington,
Paris, Waverly and other nearby
towns. Will you do it?
