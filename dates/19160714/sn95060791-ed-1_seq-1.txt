Just Split the Difference.
In a jury trial in a small town not
many miles from civilization the rural
gentlemen Into whose hands the case
ot the plaintiff and defendant was
placed were so stubbornly divided
that thev were some twenty-odd hours
in reaching a verdict. As they left
the court, after having rendered the
verdict, one ot them was asked by a
friend what the trouble was. "Waal,"
he said, "six on 'em wanted to give the
plaintiff $4.000, and six on 'em wanted
to give him $3,000, so we split the dif
ference an' give him $500."
Need for Consideration.
"What should one do," asks the
young doctor, "when a patient comes
n and diagnoses his own case exact
ly?" "In such a situation," explains
(he experienced physician, "you must
use your best judgment of human na
ture. If the patient is one kind of
man he will appreciate your agreeing
with his diagnosis as showing that he
knows as much as you do; on the
jther hand he may go about and say
that you don't know any more than he
does."
Discouraging.
A baby brother had just arrived and
little Edna was greatly disappointed.
That night she refused to say her
prayers. When the nurse asked her
why, Edna replied: "Oh, what's the
use? I've been praying for a little
sister for six months, and Bobbie, he
unly began asking for a little brother
yesterday, and he got his right off."
