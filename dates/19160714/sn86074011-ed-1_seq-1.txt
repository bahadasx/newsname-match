Vardaman In 1918.
Th rrs U a little coterie of talk-
nJv-iXfiUlemen Fcattered around
more or less connpicuoualy all over
the State that are very diligent in
trying to nuike it appear that Sen
ator Yardman has made and is mak
ing a great mistake in opposing the
ship suhsidy hill and the prepared
ness craze. lint it will he ohserved
that these gentlemen most generally
come from among that element of
our population heretofore known in
Mississippi politics as "antis," "cau
cusites" etc., and are therefore under
suspicion-have heen hunting for had
things to tell on this man Yardman
for all these years. Everyone is
coming to realize that the ship suh
sidy hill was a had thing and the
prepardness talk is getting thinner
and thinner as the daj-s go hy.
Amory Times-Press
The Weekly agreed with Senator
Vardaman in his attitude towards
the ship purchase hill, hoth as to
his statemanship judgment," the
courageousiiess of his conviction.
and his consistency with democratic
doctrine. It is 'becoming more and
more evident as world events shape
conditions regarding international
'commercial interests that the adop
tion of such a policy would have
heen contrary to the very principles
upon which this free government
is founded, and that the emer
gency which was proclaimed by
a syndicate of shipbuilding in
terests existed only in their in
ordinate greed to ilush their
pockets at the government's ex
pense. The Weekly impugns no
representative or senator's motive in
advocating that measure. It prefers
to believe them honestly mistaken,
s With congressmen, mistakes occur
from lack of statesmanship more
often than from dishonesty of mo
tive. The mistake is just as hurt
ful whatever the cause, as for that
matter. .
Mr. Yardaman's attitude towards
the craze for inordinate preparedness
is also coming to be fuliy appreciat
ed by many who were swept oft their
judgment' by the stupendous howl

Reason should sit enthroned in
every .man's judgment. Govern
ments have not been abandoned by
Providence to the uncertainty of
man's ambition. Like individuals,
they sin, but CJod holds the ultima--tmn
of their destiny and, punishes
theni-sometimes rehabilitates them,
at other times reorganizes them, but
always, for the good of the world of
mankind.
Every nation needs men of ealm
judgment and courageous convic;
tions. It needs them as a balance
wheel to regulate the government
machinery when it becomes demor
alized by fear or over impressed by
the loud clamorings of mercenary
interests.
Mr. Vardaman, like all public
men, who think right and act right,
will come before his constituency a
stronger man in 1918 than he was
in 1911.
There is a reason; for time will
have proven him to be a statesman
with the courage of his convictions,
no matter at what sacrifice an ex
pression those convictions may have
been to himself.

Improving: Our Cottcn.
There is a strong demand for a
good quality of cotton and a careful
handling of the staple until it reaches
the manufacturers. This need of a
better staple and careful handling
was responsible for rhe English spin
ners promoting the large plantations
in the Delta of Mississippi:
. Under prevailing conditions it is
more difficult to produce cotton at
a profit than formerly, and for this
reason the farmers of Mississippi are
urged to use their best efforts to grow
good staple and see that the bales
are not weather damaged before
placing on the market.
I5y all means there should be
standardized warehouses, bonded
and sensibly managed in each coun
ty where cotton could be stored at a
minimum of expense and given a
maximum of protection; the staple
should not be allowed to get wet be
fore marketing.
The State of Mississippi could
well afford to supply these ware
houses for protecting a crop that
brings to the State from seventy to
ninety millions of dollars annually.
And there is no reason why, with
sensible management by honest
men, that such a system of ware
houses should not be self-sustaining.
Shortly before the outbreak of the
European war, the writer had the
pleasure of spending several days
with one of the large manufacturers
of England who was here to make a
first hand study of cotton and the
conditions under which it was pro
duced. He repeatedly emphasized
the necessity of a better staple and
the exercising of care to prevent
water damage. Under date of June
20th, a personal letter from this gen
tleman contained the following ad
vice that is , worthy of careful con
sideration by our farmers: - ,
''I would like to express my views
to you and other leaders of the dif
ferent states, the conclusions that I
reached while in your country. They
were, thai the . conditions were ideal
.Xetcpttpn Eojn nad.tber i ample
room to encourage the people to
grow a better staple.
"Each district could be offered a
substantial prize or bonus for the
most successful improvement shown
the same to be passed upon and
classified by government experts.
''Secondly, that concrete stores
should be erected in every cotton
area where same could be graded
officially and bonded, to be released
only when prices were profitable to
the grower. You know how it is ex
ploited before it reaches the con
sumer by people who are of no ben
efit whatever to tha producer or con
sumer, and it would avoid the mar
ket being flooded at certain periods
of the season.
"What is to stop each state tak
ing this up ? They should be gov
ernment owned, government financ
ed and a minimum interest charge
made until such time as it is releas
ed from bond. Cotton does not de
preciate with keeping, and I am
firmly convinced that the demand
will grow very largely after we have
settled the account with the mad
Huns."
This suggestion from , one of the
large manufacturers is well worth
the most careful consideration by
our safest and best men. Cotton is
otfr principal money crop and must
continue so.. The cotton states
should grant to the. producer every
help possible to aid in financing and
handling this, Uncle Sam's greatest
export article of commerce.

The American people cannot have
a larger navy, and stronger land de
fense without paying for them. That
they want these things is no longer
questioned. That they are able and
willing to pay for. them in just tax
levies is as little open to dispute.
The revenue bill now submitted to
the House for these purposes, pro
vides an additional Federal income
of $210,000,000. The new taxes
proposed are taxes upon wealth.
There are in no cases a tax on con
sumption or poverty. These, there
fore, meet the general test of justice
in taxation.
More than half of the new revenue
will come from doubling the present
normal rate of 1 per. cent., on ex
cess incomes and increasing the sur
tax rates from the preseut extreme
of 6 per cent., to 10 per cent.
These rates will still appear low
when compared with the impositions
now prevalent in Europe. But the
exemptions remain the same, when
they might be reduced to include all
incomes in excess of $2,000 or even
$1,500, if added exemptions were
provided for dependent children.
Why, moreover, is the muddling and
evasive provision of "collecting at
source' retained instead of substi
tuting "information at source.'
, The remainder of the new revenue
will come about half and half from
inheritance taxs, which were resort
ed to in the Spanish as well as the
Civil War, and from taxes on the
manufacture of war munitions which
are something new in Fedoral ex
cise experience. No part of the bill
will more commend itself to the
public sense of fairness and fitness
than this of munition taxes, for
while the taxes fall on gross receipts
they are measured up from excessive
net profit as above 10 per cent.
The bill carries provision for a
Tariff Commission. That will have
the support of all parties. It pro
vides special protection for the dye
stuffs industry, which is justified by
the peculiar circumstance retd
by the European war. Its most
novel provision is that directed
against ''dumping," whieh is made
criminal as in restraint of trade and
not a 'source of extra customs rev
enue. This revenue measure in its gen
eral character is unassailable. Its
burden is heavy, but has become
necessary, and that hurden is placed
where it can most easily be borne
and where the debt is greatest to a
nation made stronger in its own de
fense. New York World.
