; British Front in France, July 1 4, via Lohdon, 7 p. m.
The British have now taken both Bazentin-le-Petit and Bazen-
tin-le-Grand as well as Longueval. The struggle is continuing
in the wood beyond Longueval and on the higher points of the
ridge.
Rome, July 14, via London, 2:45 p. m. The summit of
Castelletto in the Tofana has been blown off by the Italians,
: the entire Austrian force there being buried in the wreckage,
the war office announced today.
; The announcement says :
I "In the region of the Adige valley our artillery obtained
f hits on the enemy's batteries on the slopes of Biasena and also
: v on columns of troops and a transport onthe march. A coun
j ter-attack of the enemy on Mtmte Maiel was beaten off.
i "On Sette Comuni plateau heavy fighting continues. In
the Tofana region the enemy's positions on Castelletto summit
east of the Col Dei Bois peak commanded the road of the Dolo
mites. On the night of July 1 1 we exploded a powerful mine
which blew them up entirely and gave us possession of them."
ft Petrograd, July 1 4, via London. A furious counter
attack was launched by Austrian and German forces yesterday
against the Russians west of the Stripa. The war office an
nouncement of today says that in this region the Russians took
3,200 prisoners and captured two guns and 1 9 machine guns.
British, Front j'n France, July 14,
via London-. The second phase of the
British offensive on the Somme front
was opened at dawn today and In the
course of an Intense struggle through
out the day the British forces gained
i Important successes. They penetrat-
ed the German second line of defen-
scs over a front of about four miles,
,, captured the towns of Bazentln-le-
Grand, Bazentln-le-Petlt and Longue-
' val, and made substantial gains In
) Trones wood and at a number of
other points.
5 The prisoners taken Jnclude two
.' colonels.
One hundred English soldiers who
had been surrounded in Trones wood
by Germaris and had held out were
rescued In the morning rush.
Renewing their great offensive In
J northern France at daybreak today,
,' the British broke into the German
' Becond line In the Somme region along
1 a four mile front.
2 In the Verdun region the Germans
i bo far have not followed up their bom-
bardment of the Port Souvllle region
i by further infantry assaults. Heavy
J artillery fire in this sector Is being
continued.
i German activity was noted north of
)the Aisne where attempted attacks
were stopped by French machine gun
fire.
The recent favorable turn of events
of the Russians in Turkish Armenia
f resulting In their recapture of Ma
ll makhatun has been taken advantage
I of by Grand Duke Nicholas to press
the Turks further westward.
'I '
; London. July 14. 12:25 p. m. At
: - daylight this morning tHo British, re-
Ssumlng the offensive north of the
Somme, attacked the German second
line defenses and, according to the re
port of their commander, General Sir
) Douglas Halg, succeeded in penetrat-
ing them on a front of four miles.
I Press dispatches from the front add
v that the villages of Bazentin le
'h Grand and Longueval, north of Mon-;-p
tauban and the remaining portion of
!r Trones woods were taken by the Brit-
;( ish.
While it was expected the British
l would not allow any gieat length of
-y time to elapse before continuing their
U operations, it was hardly believed the
j second German line would be attacked
' s after only one day of artillery prepar-
; ' atlon, -for It. was only the day before
. : yes'erday that they completed capture
"I of the first line n the region between
i '
Hardecourt and Ovlllers. The direc
tion of the attack too, was something
of a surprise for Instead of pushing
on toward Combles, General Halg
chose to attack the flank of the Ger
mans who faced Contalmaison and
Ovillers and those who still occupy
Pozieres The advance to Longueval
and Bazentin le Grand, if accom
plished, gives the British possession of
other Important roads running in var
ious directions which have been a
great help to the Germans in supply
ing their army directly south of the
Ancre river.
News of the British success was re
ceived in London with the greatest
enthusiasm. It has given added
weight to the request of the govern
ment to workmen to forego the Aug
ust holidays, so that the army may be
kept well supplied witb munitions.
There was no news this morning of
important development on the remain
der of the western front, but at last
accbunts the French were preparing
to resume their offensive south of
the Somme while the Germans wore
still hammering at the defenses of
Verdun. The opinion is held in France,
however, that continuation of the
Somme battle will compel the Ger
mans to slacken their efforts at Ver
dun which now have been in progress
nearly five months, especially as the
French estimate the Germans lost 12,
000 men in counter attacks on Con
talmaison. Struggle on Stokhod River.
The Russians have made no notice
able advance on any part of their
front since they gained the Stokhod
river, whore the struggle continues
desperately. The right bank appar
ently has been cleared of Germans but
it is not known here whether tho
crossings made by the Russians have
given them a firm footing on the left
bank. General von Bothmer, -having
received reinforcements, has succeed
ed in holding the Russians in Galicia
but with Delatyn In the hands of the
Russians, they possess an advantage
from which further success is expect
ted. The operations in tho Caucasus are
becoming more and more important.
After suffering heavy losses in their
counter offensive, the Turks are now
being pressed back towards Baiburt
and Erzlgnan while in Persia the Rus
sians have brought up reinforcements
to Ernest the Turks who drove them
from Kermanshah.

New York, July 14. Dr. S. J. Melt
zer of tre Rockefeller Institute re
ceived many Inquiries today regard
ing his treatment of infantile paraly
sis which was tho only one recom
mended at the special conference of
the Academy of Medicine held last
night to discuss the disease now epi

the treatment of all cases by instra
spinal Injections of solutions of
solutions of adrenalin.
"This procedure," said Dr. Meltzer,
"may save life and In surviving cas
es it may reduce1 the extent of the
final lesion. There is no danger in
volved. The extent of susceptibility to tho
disease is relatively small. It is low
er than in measles, scarlet fever, or
diphtheria. ' The present outbreak is
not extraordinary, the expert pointed
out, for not since the disease first
appeared in 1907 has the country
been entirely freed from it. Every
summer since then has brought some
accession of the disease.
New York, July 14. A marked in
crease in both new cases and deaths
during the last twenty-four hours
from infantile paralysis was shown
today In the report of the health de
partment. During the twenty-four
hour period ending at 10 a. m. today
there were 162 new cases while 31
children died from the disease in the
five boroughs of New York.
Brooklyn had the greatest number
of new cases in a single day since

Berlin, July 14, by wireless to Say-

caused the withdrawal by the Ger- H
mans of a single man or a single gun I IH
from the Verdun front, where the IH
attack on the French fortress is be- H
in consistently and ' successfully i H

summarizing newspaper comments on IH
the western front campaign. IH
"The German success reported yes- i IH
terday to have been won on the right I H
bank of the Meuse near Fort Souvllle I H
and Laufee plateau 13 commented up- IH
on by the German newspapers as an H
event of remarkable Importance," JH
"This, the first enterprise attempted H
at Verdun since the beginning of the H
great enemy offensive, proves con- H
clusively that the head of the Ger- . H
man army, despite all hostile attacks ' H
on both the eastern and western H
fronts, has not lost sight of the or- , jH

Verdun Battle Continues. i M
"No German soldier and no Ger- H

enemies had hoped to seize the initia- M

of millions of men and lay down a M
course of action for the Germans they IH
have been bitterly disappointed by H
the course of events. M
"After the brief successes won at ' M

"The success won near SouviIle is H
worthy of mention as one of the IH
