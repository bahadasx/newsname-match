Passing of J. W. Millburn
J. W. Millburn, a former citizen
of Laclede, who has lived on his
farm near Fargo, Okla., for the
last seven years, surrounded by his
family and a few friends, passed to
his eternal home, June 26, 1916.
Mr. Millburn's health had been
failing for several months, and
though it was pronounced cancer
of the bowels, it is quiet evident
his death was caused by poison
from a bridge of alloyed metal in
his teeth. Last fall he had a fore
warning that his family was going
to suffer a great loss. Six weeks
before he died the doctors told
him he could not live long. He at
once became submissive to God's
will, and endeavored to teach his
family to be so too.
He had been a devoted Christian
for thirty-nine years. He loved
church and especially devotional
meeting where he could testify oi
his love for Christ, His life was
one of truth, honesty and Chris
tianity. His days of sickness were
devoted to praise for God's good
uess. He was a member of the Wood
ward I. O. O. F. lodge, and of the
(irand Lodge iu 1906 at Enid. To
this o 'der he had been a member
for thirty years. He belonged to
the Fargo M. E. church.
He was born in Ohio, October 8,
1830. At the age of five his par
ents moved to Missouri where he
grew up on a farm near Memphis.
To this home, after the death of
his parents, he brought his young
bride, Miss Maggie Snare. To
this union two girls were born, one
dying in infancy, the other, Ethelda
Eno, now Mrs. A. L. Berray, who
has on account of her great love
for hr parents, made her home
always with them.
In 1885 he moved to Cantral,
Iowa, and in 1890 to Laclede, Mo.
At both places he had a well
equipped harness shop and became
a successful business man. In 1900
he moved to Oklahoma and has
since lived on a farm.
The funeral services were held at
his home in the grove, June 29,
conducted by his pastor, Rev.
Simms. The choir S9"g the old
songs of praise he loved, and Miss
Allen sang the solo, "Jesus Lover
of My Soul," the song he loved for
his daughter to sing over and over.
The floral offerings from aid "so
ciety, friends, lodge and relatives
covered his casket and were tokens
of esteem.
The remains was laid to rest in a
steel vault, at the Woodward ceme
tery. He leaves a wife, daughter
and son-in-law, to mourn his loss.
