Bar Association in Endorsement of
Theophilus.
The Scott County Bar association at
their regular meeting this morning at
the conclusion of the reading of the
docket for the June term passed reso
lutions endorsing Judge Win. Theoph
ilus of the local district court for judge
of the Iowa supreme court. The fol
lowing resolutions were adopted:
Whereas, for the past six years, Hon.
Wm. Theophilus, has, with a singular
devotion to duty and with a marked
ability as a judge, presided over our
district court, and has, by the justness
and fairness of his decisions, and by his
able administration and conscientious
interpretation of the Uw, reflected not
only a credit upon himself, but an
honor upon the Scott county bar and
Whereas, he has become, through the
voice of the people expressed at the
primary election, a candidate for judge
of the supreme court of the State of
Iowa, and his candidacy now submitted
to the voters of the state upon a non
partisan judicial ballot for the Novem
ber election now
Therefore, be it resolved by the
Scott County Bar association in regu
lar meeting convened in the court
house at Davenport, Scott county, la.,
on this 6th day of June, A. D., 1916,
that we recognize in the Hon. Wm.
Theophilus a lawyer and judge of lib
eral legal learning, of keen, logical and
analytical mind, sound judgment and a
man of high ideals and steadfast integ
rity, possessing in a marked degree a
superior judicial temperament for the
proper administration of justice with
firmness and fairness to all alike, and
we therefore heartily recommend him
to the consideratian of the voters of
the State of Iowa as a person most fit
and worthy to be elected a judge of the
supreme court of Iowa.
A Big Saccess.
The Cresco people never do things in
a half way, which was evidenced again
in their 4th of July celebration. The
parade was a grand affair, far superior
to any circus parade or industrial par
ade ever held in this part of the coun
about fifty niesly decorated floats
Representing the various business inter-'
ests in the town, and three bands were
in the parade.
iAryi
Their vaudeville attractions, base ball,
bands and fireworks all were very good,
and the attendance certainly was very
large, people coming there in autos and
on the trains from far and near.—Cal
mar Courier.
For Sale.
A fine driving horse, very gentle and
suitable for a lady or a child to drive, a
good traveler. A single harness almost
bran new, and a single buggy. Also a
light surrey which has recently had a
new top, side curtains, mud guards,
and new cushions put on and been
painted and varnished this spring so

be used with single horse or a team.
Cheap. Call or write, John C. Olson,

Base Ball
Sunday, July 16th, at Matt. Flood's
ball park Protivin vs. Cre co. This is
a game you do not want to pass up.
Protivin claims that they haven't lost a
game this season and that they are go
ing to do their best to win from Cresco.
We want a booster crowd to help things
along and we will look for a big crowd
from Protivin as well as from Cresco,
at this game. Don't fail to come.
S. D. Towae Passes Away.
Squair Towne, a veteran of the civil
war, passed away Wednesday forenoon.
He had been in poor health for some
time, but about a week previous to his
death he fell and sustained a fractured
rib and doubtless other injuries, which
eventuated in his death.
The funeral will take place this after
noon at 2:00 o'clock at the residence,
conducted by Rev. Rutherford.

Library Notice.
The Public Library now has most of
the publications of the State Historical
Society, and those who think Iowa too
young to have a written history]will be
surprised to find what has been written.
Besides biographies of the early gov
ernors and others prominent in the
making of our state, there are histories
of certain lines of legislation, such as,
"History of road legislation," "History
of taxation," "History of work acci
dentlinderonity." There is Mrs. Sham
baugh's book about that interesting
community, Amana. Also a history of
the Hollanders in Iowa, and the Quakers
in Iowa. One article in the Iowa Jour
nal of History & Politics is about "The
Spanish land grants ofj Upper Louisi
ana." Iowa history? Only a little
farther back than the first birthday of
some of the older people still with us,
the land we now call Iowa was part of
Louisiana Territory.
A valuable gift to the Library is a
history. of the Norwegian people by
Professor Knut Gjerset, a member of
the faculty of Luther College. This
work is in two large volumes, published
by the M&cmillan Company, and is pre
sented by the First Lutheran Church of
Cresco.
Lanesboro Defeats Cresco Boys
Lanesboro defeated Cresco boys in a
ball game Sunday, score 10 to 7, get
ting 8 of their runs in the first inning.
Cutting out this inning it was a fairly
good game. Cresco boys were surely
off in getting started and here to fore
have shown better stuff, and we have
confidence that they will do better in
the future by continuous practicingand
playing teams in their class. We do
not think Lanesboro is out of their
class by omitting the first inning you
will see it was a fairly good game of
hits and runs. Score by innings:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Lanesboro..8 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3—12
Cresco 2 2 0 3 0 0 0 0—7
Lanesboro runs 12, hits 15.
Cresco runs 7, hits 10.
Struck out by Lanesboro pitcher 7.
Sftuck out by Cresco pitcher IX.
,Tfe
strike outs are in favor of Cres­
co pitcher.
New Hampton's $1,000 per month
ball team was defeated by the Du
buque White Sox in a poorly played
game Sunday 9 to 15. They get their
bumps in the.high priced and profes
sional base ball as well as the local
amateur base ball.
Awards Paving and Curbing Contract
The city council at their meeting held
last Monday evening awarded a con
tract for three blocks of paving and
curbing to Fred Carlson, of Decorah,
who will commence work about Aug.
1st. The contract price is $1.60 per
square yard for paving and 24c per
lineal foot for curbing. In 1915, the
same firm charged $1.40 for paving and
22c for curbing on a similar job in
Cresco. The advance in price is more
than made up in the increased cost of
material used. The job done in Cresco
by Carlson in 1915 was first class and
this year's work will doubtless be up to
the Carlson standard. The new paving
consists of two blocks east from the
present paying on Third Ave. East and
one block west from the electric light
plant to the Huber furniture factory.
