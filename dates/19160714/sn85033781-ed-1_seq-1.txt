Paw Paw was bhocked last Tuesday
morning lo learn that Miss Nora Bar
trem of Port Huron, one of the teach
ers in th" Paw Paw schools the past
year had taken her life in Lansing
briefly stated, the facts in the case
are as follows:
During the year l'.M.'J, Miss Hartretn
became acquainted with Duane Mosier
of Paw Paw whih attending the U. of
II. at Ann Arbor A warm friendship
sprang up hetw-en the couple, winch
coutinued until quitn recently, and
there was a tentative understanding
that at some time the)' would be mar
ried. Mr. Mosier decided, however, and
had explained to her, Unt it would be
better fur both of them if the tentative
engagement were broken. She whs of a
nervous, melancholy di-positiun and
brooded over the disappointment.
On Tuesday she left her home in Port
Huron ami went to Lansing to see
Duai e. lie was in Ionia on business
connected with the Attorney General's
Office, and she awaited his return. She
uas sitting on the porch at his board
house aHU:.'!) P. M. wh n he returned.
At her rt quet they started for a walk.
Tht-y had nut gone far, when she usked
hjm to sU p al.ead, us she desired to fix
her stocking, lit hd so, hu1 hearing a
gurgling sound turned to find her
drinking the contents of a small vial.
He at onpe hided a passing auto, and
th( unfortunate girl was taken to her
hotel, where in company with the house
physician she was hurried to the hos
pital. In spite of all that could be done
she passed away at 3:00 o'clock in the
morning. She hiul taken bichloride of
mercury, and another vial of the same
poison together with a loaded revolver
both of which she purchased after ar
riving in Lansing, were found in her
grip it the hotel.
The unfortunate girl was a highly
educated lady of refinement and cul
ture, and made mai.y friends in Paw
paw during her st-iy here. She was of
I nervous temperament, however, high
strung and of a melancholy disposition.
It is thought b thoe who knew her
best that she became temporarily de
ranged, and went to Lansing with the
intention of killing both Mosier and
herself.
Duane is distracted of r the tragedy,
but no blame can in tn manner be
attached to him. At his request a
postmortem was held conducted by
two Lansing phsiciane who attended
her and the famil physician of the
Bartrem family.
In a signed statement, it was shown
that deceased came to her death by the
use of bichloride of mercury adminis
tered by herself. That there was no
suggestion cr evidence of any kind or
nature that would prompt her to take
her life.
The parents of Miss Bartrem also
stated that they had no ill wiil toward
Duane or anyone. They seemed to
realize that the nervous tension under
which their daughter labored had been
growing worse for nearly a year and
that the sad ending of her life was the
culmination of an hysteria over which
she had no control.
