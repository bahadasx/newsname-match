Reduce High Cost of Living by Using
the Monongahela River, Says United
States Army Engineer
I PROMISES lUKTIVE ASSISTANDL
Kb
First Step is to Improve the Terminal Facilities in the j
Local Harbor?Will Be Back Soon in the
Swan.
Colonel Edward Jadwln of tko Unit
??fl States Engineer Department with
headquarters at Pittsburgh, Pa., while
(teaming down the Monongahela rlv*
lr,Z '.i*y aftornoou ?n the Klttan
fiSf .W>. ?. pttrt>' of Falrmonters
aboard had lots to say concerning tho
irlver and tho way It has fallen Into
disuses as a freight carrier. Twenty
years ago the United Stales govern
ment paid |2,500,000 to improve tho
Monongahela river, and Col. Jadwln
?aid, as the boat approached Morgan
town, 'Hero I've come all the way
from Fairmont to Morgantown look
ing for craft; tho sign of enterprise,
ggfand that's tho llrst boat I've
Been." He pointed and his party's
eyes fell upon a motor boat Hying up
the stream with throe cases of beer
aboard. ".Thm's all tho people of
West Virginia along the Monongahela
think of their flno river. Why this is
the flnest river running into pits,
burgh. It has 15 locks to the Alio-1
gbeny's three and maintains a more
even all-year-round stage than the
Ohio." ?
Speaking of the way In which the
I Fairmont and Morgantown people
have been treating tho river Col. Jad
win said: 'You peoplo certainly must
^not know that tho high prices of
?taples In- Fairmont (of which he
"showed remarkablo knowledge) had
ithelr atari wl|h thj^?*ailroads eating
lithe, lives out of tile shippers and tht
ggaSpnsumers. Do you kuow that the rail
; p*oad freight rates between Pitts
\ 'Durig and Now York are but half what
they are betweon Pittsburgh and Fair
mont? Have you ever stopped to no
JSfa'ualnt yourselves with the real un
derlying causes of Fairmont's high
prices?
"You speak of what a fine town you
have because thore are three trunk
line railroads running into your city.
If you are really in love with tho rail
roads I'll keep quiet, but If you want
f to hear the truth I'll tell you some
thing, even In tho presence of Major
I Samuel D. Brady. Tho three rail
roads havo agree'] on rates between
I points they reach and Fairmont, and
I these rates are perfectly satisfactory
! to all three roads but not to tho con
! sumer. But what are you going to do?
You must ship your goods, you must
receive them so the best thing to do
1b to look to the rivers."
CoL. Jadwln protested about the con
.. ditlon of tho wharf at Fairmont hut
not feel too greatly out of sorts con
cerning It, knowing that something
could still bo done to lmprovo It.
But when he reached Morgantown he
struck a real snag.
There the representative of the
United States government could not
i 'iittpe tho wharf beonuso the city had
rented It to an Individual who charg
| |?sjd so much for a bathing suit and so
much for a swim. Th0 Klttannlng
flying the Stars and Stripes and Col
? oners ensign could not dock at that
8 gjjrnarf. It was necessary that Col.
Jadwln assert his authority before
i be oould set foot on Monongalia coun
-Ity ion.
fcfCJoL Jadwln investigated minutely
. concerning tho manner In which the
railroads have shut off the wharfs
ftt Fairmont, Morgantown and Browns
viUe^nd how the Illvesvllle wharf
which at one time was a flrst-olass
landing, had become useless. He Is

The Old Haymaker at Work!
Industrial Engineer Says
Fairmont Needs Com
munity Cooperation.
Probably the most discussed matter
on the streets of Fairmont today is
the report of Industrial Ensineor
Speed In the Chamber of Commerce
meeting yesterday evening. Although
he has only been In Fairmont about
three weeks and his survey and tabu
lation of the Industries and resources
of the community are by no menns
completed, yet the regular meeting
yesterday he gave the members of the.
Chamber and the citlzons of the cityfl
much to considor. His report was!
more in the manner of outlining a con
struction company hero than a list 01
town shortcomings.
The main point of Speed's romarka
was that the "personal factor" entered
more Into the development of a city
than any other one thing. Theroforo
without community co-operative spirit
and a willingness among all of th6
people to back up the work of the
Chamber by personal and financial
aid very little can be accomplished."
""When your town becomes a good
place to live in and rents and the cost
of food are reasonable factories with
labor and capital will como of them
selves" said Mr. Speed.
As to the chief disadvantages at
present existing In Fairmont, Speed,
from his preliminary survey, was ot
j the opinion that his rents and high
1 cost of certain food products caused
by lack of sufficient truck farmers,
was the most noticeable.
; Concerning advantages ho said that

E DELAY IN
Arguments by Contending
Attorneys Deferred Un
til Wednesday.
No decision was made yesterday af
ternoon by the county court concern
ing the Lincoln District road bond
proposition and the arguments of tho
attorneys will he heard further next
Wednesday. The court adjourned af
ter allowing the affadavit of Doputy
Sheriff Bambridge to be fillod, where
in he stated lhat the date of posting
the notices had been March 27 iusteud
of March 28 as written on the return
made by hira to the court. The ab
sence of Attorney Frank Haymond,
one of the attorneys for tho Llnooln
district citizens who contend that th?
bond olectlon was illegal, and the re
cent employment of E. 0. Smith of
Clarksburg, was the reason given for
the delay in hearing further argument
on the matter. Mr. Smith wished
time In which to bccorae famillnr with
all of tho details of the case and noxt
Wednesday was set as the time for
the final consideration of the affair.
Whether or not tho attorneys will
attempt to havo Judge Maxwell of
Clarksburg grant an injunction re
straining the court from selling tho
bonds in the meantime could not be

Spent Several Hours at Art
Glass Plant
Ruins.
Fire Marshal KIndleberger arrived
In Fairmont on the noon lnterurban
oar from Clarksburg today to Investi
gate the burning o? the Art Glass fac
tory on the East Side Wednesday.
The marshal spent the first two
hours looking over the debris wBere
once the factory stood. Later he op
ened his Investigations and will re
(main here until every clue concerning
the Are Is run down. There ai? many
trails open to him but ho will begin
with the statements of the Immediate
family of Mrs. Frank Hentzy. owner
o fthe factory.
Qeorge Hentiy when questioned yos
terday afternoon by the fire chief was
unable to throw much light on tho
fire. The stories of the mombcrs of
the Hentiy family do not agree. The
authorities particularly are not Im
pressed by that one which mentioned
John Johnson, a former employe of
the plant. Johnson was at the factory
early In the afternoon and talked to
Mrs. Hontiy. He left fully two hours
before the flro broke out. The state
ment that he could not bo found yes
terday seems also to have been an
error. Possibly no attempt was made
to find htm. He was about town today
and can account for all his time on the
da yof the fire.
