to more efficient methods of locating

indicated the capture of the villages of Longueval and

A despatch from the British front in France says
Bazentin-le-Pctit, a mile beyond BaxcntJn-lc-Grand, has
also been captured.
Berlin reports, apparently cabled before the new British ,
attack began at dawn this morning, say a great battle has
been going on east of Contalmaison for eighteen hours.
This report spoke of heavy attacks near Longueval and in
the Trones Wood. These attacks were continuing, said
the Berlin report.
Berlin also reported violent fighting on both sides of
the Somme River, but claimed the French attacks in tha
region of Barleux had broken down. Paris reported quiet
on this section of the front.
Germans claim that the Russian advance on the Stokhod
River, east of Kovel, has been thrown back.
Berlin despatches say the attacks on Verdun will still
go on, and that no men or guns have been taken from that
tront. The German War Office announces that French
attacks on the Verdun front were repulsed.
