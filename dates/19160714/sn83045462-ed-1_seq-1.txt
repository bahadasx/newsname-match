DEMOCRATS SUE
TO CORJTliff
Chairman McCormick in. Chicago
Trying to Frame Up
Deal on the Governorship.
v PLAN TO NAME ROBINS
IN HOPE TO GET VOTE
Dunne to Be Urged Not to Seek ReElection
and Roger Sullivan Approves.
It Is Said.
BY N. O. MESSENGER.
v NEW YORK. July 14.?Chair
nan McCormick of the demo
cratic national committee is ir
Chicago trying to frame up a deal
on the governorship contest
which, if successful, may have
important bearing upon the national
and state campaign. 1
learn through a round-about bul
trustworthy way from Chicago
that Mr. McCormick is trying to
induce Gov. Dunne, the demo
cratic incumbent, not to run fot
renomination.
Upon Gov. Dunne's acquiesence in the
suggestion, it is the plan to nominate
as the democratic candidate for governor
Raymond Robins, the celebrated
bull mooser and radical, known
throughout Illinois in radical reform
circles. Mr. Robins, it will be remembered,
presided over the bull moose
convention at Chicago.
The object, of course, would be to attract
to the democratic ticket the wander-insr
bull moose, who now are with
?ut corral or feeding: trough.
The plan is said to meet the approval
of Roger Sullivan, the great democratic
factional chieftain, and to be regarded
as a happy offset to the impending republican
harmony. The natural assumption
among its sponsors is thai
If Mr. Robins attracted the Illinois
bull moose to the state ticket they
would also give their support to the national
ticket. Word has not reached
New York yet of the success of the
pending negotiations.
Now Looking to Maine.
Great preparations are being made by
the democratic national committee for
a ferocious drive in the Maine campaign,
in which state two United States
senators and four representatives in
Congress are to be elected September
11. ^
From "down east" the report comes
to The Star's correspondent that the
democrats hope to use $100,000 in the
Maine campaign. According to this
story, which has excellent backing, the
Maine democrats have agreed to raise
$25,000 if the national committee will
give an equal amolint, and that this
The duplicator is to deponent unknown,
but said to be ready with the cash, and
there is accordingly. It is reported, loud
rejoicing among the faithful in Maine,
with corresponding gloom among the
republicans.
The democratic national organization
here has taken a flying start and is
several laps ahead of the republicans in
actual campaign work. The republicans
haven't even moved into their headquarters
yet and are fussing and fuming
along with a few clerks at the Astor
Hotel.
The democrats have and will have
about thirty rooms in an office building
on 42d street near the Grand Central
terminal ahd are about to overflow
into a new building. They have
everything complete from gold lettering
on the doors to electric fans and
there are so many typewriting machines
going at the same time that
it sounds.- like a thrashing machine
at harvest time. The big plant
has been put upon an efficiency basis
by Edward A. Filene, a Boston merchant.
Leaders Become Active.
Representative Carter Glass of Virginia,
secretary of the committee, has
been here for a week at work. Henry
Morgenthau, chairman of the finance
committee, and Treasurer Marsh have
also been active in their respective and
highly necessary "lines of endeavor,'
with apparent success, for somebody
has had to "put up" for the elaborate
establishment. However, that Is what
Ambassador Morgenthau was brought
home for and he has certainly "been on
the Job.'*
Fred Lynch, chairman of the execu
tlve committer, has been busy in thai
quiet way of his, which is based upor
the precept of withholding from th<
left hand unnecessary information o!
what right hand is doing.
For a man of his size, and he is pretty

Method of Treatment.
Dr. S. J. Meltzer of the Rockefellei
Institute received many inquiries today
regarding his treatment of infantile
paralysis, which was the only on?
recommended at the special conference
of the Academy of Medicine, held last
night to discuss the disease now epidemic
in New York city. He urged the
treatment of all cases by intraspinal injections
of solution of adrenalin.
"This procedure," said Dr. Meltzer
"may save life, an^ in surviving cases i'
may reduce the extent of the flna
lesion. There is no danger involved."
The physician declared he had greai
. faith in this treatment because of th?
- remarkable results It accompllshec
. with monkeys which had been artificially
infected with infantile paralysis. Ir
conjunction with other physicians, h<
has conducted a long series of clinica.
experiments in this direction.

by the House.
BLOW AT HALF-AND-HALF
! CUT OUT BY COMMITTEE
' Provision for Biennial Assessment
oi neai XiSiaie ana uuer
Changes Are Made.
After striking out the House
rider abolishing the half-and-half
plan, and after restoring the language
of the present law making
appropriations for the District on
the half-and-half basis, the Senate
appropriations committee today
reported the District bill to the
Senate favorably.
The Senate committee added to
the House bill $3,020,185.62. The
amount carried by the bill, as reported
to the Senate, is $14,953,002.96,
which is about a half a
million dollars less than the estimate
for 1917, and exceeds the
existing law by $3,002,095.51.
The principal increases made in the
bill were for public schools, for the
proposed Patterson and Dean parks
and for improvements and repairs of
streets.
The Senate committee inserted a provision
that hereafter assessments of
real estate in the District for the purpose
of taxation shall be made biennially
instead of trennually, as required
by law. This amendment is deL
signed to meet the criticism that the
: assessments in the District are not kep?,
up to date.
] Besides striking: out tne ricier auing
- j away with the half-and-half plan, the
; Senate committee also struck from the
.{bill all those provisions which were
1 inserted by the House in pursuance of
r | the plan to abolish the half-and-half.
i The committee also struck out the soI
called Borland amendment providing
: that the cost of paving or repaving
k i streets shall be assessed against property
abutting the side of the street so
1 improved.
The House provision authorizing the
District Commissioners to assess and
? collect rent from all users of space occupied
under the sidewalks and streets
in the District is stricken out.
The salaries of the District Commissioners
remain the same, $5,000, although
the subcommittee has recommended
an increase to $6,000.
The same is true of the salaries in
the Public Library.
Stops Excise Board Salary.
The committee inserted a provision,
, based on an amendment offered by
, Senator Sheppard of Texas, which would
t prevent any member of the excise
board whose nomination has been rek
jected by the Senate from receiving
any salary under this bill. This is directed
especially at Gen. Robert G.
smitn, wnose uwuii?muvu
t rejected many weeks ago and who has
1 remained on the job in spite of this
rejection.
t For the enforcement of the child lai
bor law provision is made for two inI
spectors at $1,200 each, with the added
provision that the detail of two prit
vates of the police force for the eni
forcement of this act shall be disconl
tinued .
Provision is made for the restoration
of the original plan of the Rock creek
and Potomac parkway commission to
extend Rock creek parkway on the
r southeast.
The District Commissioners are aur
thorized and directed to locate the Bartholdi
fountain now in the Botanic
5 Garden, when the removal thereof is
r determined upon, on the circle at the
. intersection of Columbia road. Harvard
and Mount Pleasant streets on 16th
street.
t The Senate committee placed an item
i of $150,000 in the bill for the new mu.
niclpal hospital, called the Gallinger
Hospital, with specific directions that
b it be located on the site now owned by
t the government at 14th and -Upshur
j streets northwest.
Sale of Land Ordered.
7 The District Commissioners are au
thorized and directed to sell the land
t contained in the old right of way of
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company
within the square bounded by 6th
and 7th and I and K streets northeast
for cash at a price to be fixed by the
Commissioners based upon the true
value or the land as determined by the
board of District assessors. The money
from the sale is to "be deposited in the
Inn . tn fho nrftdlt f?f th?
United States and one-half to the credit
of the District of Columbia.
A number of increases in salaries are
included in the bill. The principal of
the Central High School is to receive
$3,000 and is to be entitled to an increase
of $100 a year for five years.
I The principals of normal high and manual
training high schools are to receive
$2,500 each as basic salaries and shall
be entitled to an increase of $100 a year
for five years.
Other Increases Proposed.
Provision is made for the expenditure
of $7,000 for the proper care and
supervision of children in the vacation
schools and playgrounds. The amount
appropriated for longevity pay is increased
from $450,000 to $485,000.
The Municipal Court Judges are given
an increase in salary from $3,000 to
$3.COO each.
The language of the House bill relating
to the Columbia Hospital for
women is stricken out and a brief paragraph
inserted carrying $20,000 for the
care of Indigent patients at that hospital.
Provision Is made for a new municipal
lodging house at $40,000.
The Senate committee inserted a provision
authorising thn commanding
Seneral of the National Guard of the
istrict to entor Into a contract for the
lease of an armory, stable, etc., for the
cavalry, field artillery, signal corps
and hospital corps. In one building or

FOR EXCISE BOARD
President Sends Nomination
to Senate?Hot Fight Over
Confirmation Predicted.
President Wilson today nominated
Andrew J. ("Cy") Cummings of this
city and Montgomery county, Md., for
member of the excise board to fill the
vacancy caused by the refusal ?f the
Senate to confirm the nomination of
Gen. Robert G. Smith. The hottest sort
of a fight is predicted over confirmation
by the Senate.
The nomination of Mr. Cummings,
who is well known in the District and
in Maryland, went to the Senatefalong
with that of Henry S. Baker to succeed
himself as a member of the board.
Mr. Baker's term expired^ June 30.
There are threats of a fight on him also,
but his friends do not believe he will
have much trouble in being confirmed.
Mr. Cummings has had strong backing
for the vacancy. He always has
been an intimate friend and political
supporter of Senator Blair Lee, having
accompanied Senator Lee on many of
his campaigns in Maryland. He has long
been active politically in Maryland,
fighting hard for his friends and entering
into every campaign with fervor, j
In this way he has made friends and
enemies. j
Voted for ILocal Option.
Mr. Cummings' friends today said they !
did not believe the Anti-Saloon League,
which has opposed Mr. Cummings for
legislative honors in Montgomery county,
would carry the fight against him to the
Senate. They declared that when Mr. ;
Cummings was member of the Maryland
legislature he voted consistently for local
option in that state and that charges
made against him by the Anti*Saloon
League on one occasion that he had
knifed the league in an amendment made
ANDREW J. CUMMINGS.
to a local option bill in the Maryland
houM were not correct or fair.
It was certain today that if there is to
be a fight it will not be onesided, dimming*'
friend* are prepared to meet any
opposition to him and his personal following
of influential men will, it was* said
today, go far toward obtaining his confirmation.
Andrew J. Cummings was born in
Chevy Chase, Md., thirty-eight years
ago, and still resides in the old Cummings
homestead, the southern boundary
of the property being on the District
line.
Attended Universities Here.
He attended Columbian University
(now George Washington University)
in this city, is a graduate of Georgetown
University and was srraduated in
law at the National Law School. Mr.
Cummings was elected to the Maryland
state legislature four times, being the j
only delegate from Montgomery count}' |
ever elected four consecutive times. He i
was one of the resident commissioners

from Maryland to the Panama-Pacific
exposition, at San Francisco and recently
was a delegate to the national
democratic convention at St. I,ouis.
Mr. Cummings always has been interested
in public affairs of the District of
Columbia.
Mr. Cummings was surprised when he
came to Washington today and received
word of his nomination. "I have been
harvesting out on my farm," he said,
"and came into the city today on some
business. I did not expect to hear of
the nomination today. I made no special
effort to obtain the nomination, as most
of my friends will attest."
Uncle of Secretary Baker.
Mr. Baker is the uncle of Secretary
Baker of the War Department. He was
born in Shepherdstown, W. Va., in 1857,
and resided there continuously until he
came to Washington about twelve years
ago. In Shepherdstown he was engaged
in a drug and general merchandise business,
but after coming to Washington he
became connected with the Allegheny
Coal Company. He has two sons, William
Lester and Henry A. Baker, and two
daughters and his wife complete the
family.
He is past master of Hiram Lodge,
No. 10, F. A. A. M., by affiliation, he
having at one time been master of l^It.
Nebo Lodge of Shepherdstown.
Mr. Baker was nominated for the excise
board the first time September 4,
1913. His nomination at that time followed
the withdrawal of the name of
Frank B. Lord, who was opposed by
the Anti-Saloon League.
PRESIDENT BACKS TWO BILLS.
Will Urge U. S. Employes' Compensation
and Child Labor Measures.
President Wilson decided today to
write a letter to Majority leader Kern
of the Senate urging that special efforts
be made to secure the passage
of the McGillicuddy compensation bill
for government employes injured in
the federal service '-and the pending
child labor bill.
Both measures already have passed
the House.
DR. ADAM CARDENAS DEAD.
Was President of Nicaragua From
1885? to 1886.
SAN JUAN DEL SUR, Nicaragua,
July 14.?Dr. Adam Cardenas, head of
the conservative party and President
of Nicaragua from 1882 to 1886, Is
dead.
Dr. Cardenas played a prominent part
In the stormy politics of Nicaragua for
the laBt forty years. In 1909 he organized
a revolutionary expedition against
President Zelaya from Costa Rica. He
was defeated and fled from the country,
but returned after the fall of the
so-called "dictator of Central America."
He supported President Estrada
and was elected president of the Nlcaracruan

Justice.
President Wilson today definitely decided
to nominate Judge J. H. Clarke
of the federal district court at Cleveland,
Ohio, as associate justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States to
succeed Charles E. Hughes, nominated
as the republican candidate for President,
and later in the day sent the name
to the Senate.
The President recently has had the
names of two men under serious consideration,
Judge Clarke being one and
Judge Victor J. Dowling of the NewYork
supreme court the other. The
choice finally fell to .hitige Clarke, who
had the support of Secretary Baxter of
the War Department, and was favorably
regarded by Attorney General
Gregory.
Judge Clarke was appointed to his

and has served with distinction since
entering upon his judiciial duties.

bar in 187fc. Up to the time of his appointment
as district judge, in 11)14,
he practiced law in all the courts of

In politics he has been a lifelong
democrat, having run against Mark
Hanna for the United States Senate in
1908. He has been conspicuous in progressive
movements in Ohio and in the
country.
He has been for some time the president
of the Short Ballot League in
Ohio. Judge Clarke is a bachelor, and
has devoted the leisure of hin life to
