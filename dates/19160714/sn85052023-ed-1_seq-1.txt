BRACK REED
GOES CRAZY
Young Milledgeville Bootlegger Ad-
judged Insane by Jury in the
County Court.
Brack Reid, one of the sons of
John Reid, of Milledgeville, was ad
judged insane by a jury in county
court Tuesday and taken to the asy
lum. Ycung Reid has 230 days yet
to serve of the sentence imposed up
on him in county court for bootleg
ging near Moreland. He is a young
'er brother of Charley Reid, who has
been at large ever since a ?3,000 fine
was imposed upon him in circuit
court for selling whisky illegally.
Brack Reid has been acting very
peculiarly ever since being placed in
jail here. Jailer DeBorde says that
he would talk to himself for hours
at a time, and kept the other pris
oners awake at night yKJffi
continually walking about, sh aking
the cell bars and preventing them
Som sleeping. , He was continually
savin- "Take them away." Mi. De
Borde savs, and the popular Jailer
is convinced that the younjg man is
not in his right mind. His father,
who testified at the lunacy inquest
stated that young Reid lost tvvo small
children some time ago and since
then has never appeared to be just
right in his head.

Latest War News
The Austro-Germans appear to
have halted, temporarily at least, the
Russian advance along the Stokhod.
Both sides are reported to be hurling
huge re-enforcements of men and
guns into this titanic struggle. On
the lower Stripa, the Russians are
striking in an effort to crush Gen.
Von Bothmer and flank the entire
Austro-German line. The Austrians
armit the Russians penetrated von
Bothmer's front at some points, but
assert they were driven out again
in counter attacks.
Important statements regarding
operations on the western front were
made in London by Premier Asquith
and David Lloyd-George, Secretary
for War. The former, in addressing
the House of Commons, said the
Franco-British drive was just begin
ning and that it would be continued
indefinitely if necessary to achieve
the objective sought. Mr. Lloyd
George, presiding at a conference on
equipment, said the tide of victory
was now flowing in the direction of
the Allies and the output of ammuni
tion soon would be overwhelming.

SCALPED IN AUTO ACCIDENT
One of the worst auto accidents
in this part of the state in some time
took place in Mercer county Satur
day. Wm. Lester, a mail carrier out
of Rose Hill, bought a new machine
a few weeks ago and with his family
was out in the car. His son was at
the wheel and teaching Mr. Lester
how to drive. The latter changed
seats with his son and drove a short
distance when he lost control of the
car. The machine ran onto a small
wooden bridge over a shallow creek
just beyond Salt river and plunged
off the abutment into the water. Mr.
and Mrs. Lester and their three chil
dren were in the car at the time. All
escaped with minor bruises and
scratches except Mrs. Lester who was
almost scalped. A long gash was cut
in her head from the left ear clear
back to the top of her head. The
flesh was laid open from the scalp as
with a knife. The skull was not
fractured and while the injury is a
very painful one, it is not considered
serious.

A wonderful flower: We are in
debted to Mrs. Margaret James for
a sight of the beautiful Night-Blooming
Cereus. On Sunday night she
sent us a full blown flower at 10
o'clock at night, at which time four
of these flowers burst into full bloom.
To those, who lilce ourselves, had
never seenthis flower, it may be that
a description, can, in a poor way.
be interesting. The flower of purest
waxen white, was shaped something
like the most perfect specimen of
water lily, except the center. This
was round and extended far into the
calyx. From this center protruded
a most perfect white five-petaled star
and just back of it a nest of short,
straw-colored pistils formed an ex
act image of a small manger, which,
if examined by a microscope, we are
told, holds a cross and crown. These
were not discernable to the naked
eye. As we looked into the waxen
depths of this lovely fiower, we real
ized in the fullest sense what purity
must mean and we saw that those
petals of snowy whiteness were the
most perfect in form that lay closest
to the heart of the flower encircling
the mimic manger, and the next row
was not quite so beautiful and the
next still less so, and so on, until at
the very outer edge, they were not
only unlike the rest in shape but the
color was gone a muddy greenish
white, and they fell entirely away
from the others clinging downward
towards the stem. And we thought
of the grand sermon that could be
preached from this sacred flower, if
only we could wield our pen as djd
Longfellow or Bryant, those lovers
of nature. How we could picture
the purest of earth, as those who
keep nearest the lowly manger and
upon whom the rays of that wonder
ful star still fall. These are the ones
who can lead. These are the ones
whose lives can enthuse and quicken
those, who, like these outer petals,
hang hopeless and weary, whose very
lives cast forth a religious fervor,
which, like the perfume of this won
derful flower, permeates the atmos
phere all around them, speaking
much plainer than words: "We are
in touch with the Master." These
flower petals opened wide at about
10 P. M., closing at 4 A.M., and al
though we put the flower in fresh
water and tried hard to keep it until
the next day, its petals closed firmly
oyer the manger and shut it from
view. Thus a bautiful glimpse of
heaven may be found in a flower. Its
' closing reminded us that God will not
always strive with man.
YOUNG MISCHIEF MAKERS HELD
Three Pickaninnies Caught Breaking
Into Poultry Yards.
Joe Will Baughman and Buck
Baughman, two small negro boys,
BoIJi about 10 or 11 years of age are
in the county jail on a burglary
charge and will be sent to the Re
form School in all probability when
circuit court meets, to which they
have been held over. Buster Love
less, a 9-year-old boy and their com
panion was released by Judge Bai
ley when the trio were brought be
fore him in county court Thursday,
as he is under the age that incorri
gible children must have attained to
enter the reform school. These pick
aninnies are charged with breaking
into Estill Carter's poultry pens sev
eral times. Other petty offenses are
charged against them also. In fact,
they with several other negro boys
about their age, are continually on
Main street, and seem to be looking
for opportunities to commit some
mischief. Much complaint has been
made about them and unless some
radical improvement is seen they will
"go over the road" before they are
much older.
LOST THEIR INFAKT SON.
Mr. and Mrs. John J. Carter, or
Danville, formerly, of Hall's Gap,

death of their little son Earl Rose
Carter, who passed away a few days
ago. The remains of the little one
were brought back to their old home
in this county for interment.
NE,W HEAD OF REFORM SCHOOL
Appointed By .Stanley Has Interest
ing Record to Qualify Him
Gov. Stanley has just had a man
with a rather remarkable record ap
pointed head of the State Reform
at Greendale, where he will have di
rect charge of the work of making
better the bad boys and girls from all
over the state. A dispatch from Lou
isville said this of Howell: Ernest J.
Howell, who has been named Super
intendent of the Greendale House of
Reform, went to Owensboro a num
ber of years ago from West Louis
ville, where he was engaged as a
barber and ran a "soft drink" stand.
He was employed in a barber shop in
Owensboro for several months and
then went into the saloon business
with William Powell under the firm
name of Powell & Howell. While in
the saloon business Howell was in
dicted on the charge of permitting
gambling at his place. The indict
ment never came to trial. Howell
claimed that his partner operated the
game above the saloon. When Gov.
Stanley was congressman in the sec
ond district he was preparing to rec
ommend Howell fdr postmaster at
Owensboro but suddenly wtihdrew
his name after a strong protest had
been lodged in Washington. Howell
was Stanley's campaign manager in
Daviess county for several years. He
was chairman of the campaign com
mittee last year when Stanley came
very near losing the county. On
Monday Howell, who is a deputy
sheriff, struck Earl Mattingly, a col
lector for the wholesale liquor house
of George D. Mattingly & Company,
at Owensboro. The young man was
talking to Howell on the court house
steps in regard to an account of
$21.75 which was contracted by How
ell last November. Howell, Matting
ly alleges, suddenly struck him two
vicious blows. The first blow split the
young man's lips. The second, he
thought, broke his nose. The young
man has defective eyes and wears
glasses. The glasses were broken
and his face covered with blood. How
ell apologized'' to him, saying that
his nasty temper got the best of him.
He accompanied the young man to a
store and bought him a new shirt and
then paid for his glasses. It is un
derstood that the young man is con
sidering filing a damage suit against
Howell.

SPLINTER PIERCED HIS CHEST
Former Casey Boy Meets Horrible
Death in Motorcycle Race
A friend of the I. J. in Indianapolis
sends in the following account of the
untimely death of Albert S. Blanken
ship, who was killed there last week
in a motorcycle accident. He was
well known in this section:
Albert Scott Blankenship, aged 24,
was killed almost instantly July 4th
afternoon when the motorcycle upon
which he had just finished the 10
mile course at the state fair grounds
smashed into the fence at the first
turn past the finish mark. His body
was hurled thro' the air for a dis
tance of 20 feet, striking as it landed
a special policeman, who suffered a
fractured leg and other injuries. The
dead man wasan amateur rider and
had competed in a few races previous
to the Fourth. He had just finished
this race and was rounding the turn
to slow down after the final lap. Sud
denly he seemed to lose control of his
machine. The motorcycle swerved in
its course and dashed into a pole on
the side of the track, a large sliver
of wood from which penetrating the
young man's chest, causing almost
instant death. Blankenship was em
ployed in a mattress factory. When
he finished his work Monday and
started away the foreman begged
him not to enter the races the next
day, telling him that if he did so, he
might have to advertise for another
mattress finisher. The boys who work
ed with him also urged him not to
risk his life, but he could not be dis
suaded and told his fellow workmen
if he was killed to throw in 25 cents
a "piece and buy forget-me-nots for
his funeral, which was what they did.
Blankenship's mother is Mrs. Min
erva Blankenship, 230 McKim ave
nue. She came from Casey county,
when her children were small and
made Indianapolis her home. "Aunt"
Minerva has tried hard to raise her
children and keep her little family to
gether. Now they are all grown She
has a son jn the army. Scott had
not been out of the army very long.
He was the only support his mother
had. Scott was a nice young man
and had many friends in his adopted
home. The factory in which he work

Judge For Yourself
Which is Better Try an Experimsr.t
Or Profit By a Stanford
Citizen's Experience
Something new is an experiment.
I Must be proved to be as represent
ed
The statement or a manufacturer
is not convincing proof of merit.
But the endorsement of friends is.
Now supposing you had a bad back,
A lame, weak or achin gone.
Would you experiment on it?
You will read of many so-cal!rd
cures,
Endorsed by strangers from far
aay places.
It's different when the endorse
ment conies from home.
Easy to prove local testimony.
Read this Stanford case:
D. C. Dyehouse, Whitley avenue,
Stanford says: "My back was so sore
and painful that it was hard for me
to get around for days at a time. I
tried everything but didn't seem to
get anything that would bring me
relief 'until' I used Doan's Kidney
Pills. They proved to be what I
needed and by the time I had finish
ed three boxs, the pain in my back
had left and I felt better in every
way."
Price 50c, at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pilk the same that
Mr. Dyehouse had. Foster-Milburn
