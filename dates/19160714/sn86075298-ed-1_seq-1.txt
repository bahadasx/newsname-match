GERMANS HALT
BRITISH DRIVE
London, July 11.-In one of the most
desperate hand to hand struggles of
the Western front the Germans drove
back the advancing British and enter
ed the Trones woods.
Five great waves of German infantry,
reinforced by heavy guns behind them,
rolled against the British lines in their
new position and were thrown back
again.
The sixth assault succeeded and the
British were thrust out of the woods.
The English are organizing themselves
for another attempt to capture the po
sition and desultory fighting continued
in the wood.
The casualties on both sides were
heavy.
With the British suffering reversal
the French drove on toward Peronne,
and announced that a brilliant attack
had carried Hill 97, an important
height which dominates the Seni cc
river southeast of lliacicc and give,
the French a great advantac in tli i
campaign back of the ( nerman line.
French Capture Village.
The taking by the French of Hiaches
village, on the bank of the Somme, op
posite St. Radegonda, the principal
suburb of Peronne, was accomplished
in about an hour and a half. Every
German in the village was killed or
capt ured.
\W'hile Berlin declares that the at
tacks of the Russians on the East
front have been repulsed at every
point, Petrograd proclaims another id
portant advance in Volhynia.
The Russians declare they are cross
ing the bitterly defended River Stok
hod at several points in their march
toward Kovel.
The Germans organized on the left
bank of the river and are holding their
ground, pouring a fire into the soldiers
crossing the stream.
The crossing of the river, it is indi
cated, is c:sting the Russians many
lives, for almost every bridge has
been destroyed by the enemy and the
waters have been mined.
BRITISH NOT EXCITED
OVER VOYAGE OF SUB
London, July 11.-Much interest has
been aroused in England over the ar
rival of the German submarine
Deutschland at an American port. The
news received is given which make no
in the evening papers, which make no
comment.
As to the voyage and the proposal
to establish a line of submarines be
twe-en Germany and America no ap
prehension whatever finds expression.
It was pointed out that in view of
the repeated voyages of both British
and terman submarines to the eastern
Mediterranean, the crossing of the At
lantic was not to be considered an un
iisial feat.
"The only surprise is that it was not
done before," said one official, who
added that there was no reason why
submarines should not get through the
North sea. "unless they met with a
mishap."

Washington, July 11.-Acting Secre.
tary Polk of the state department and
Eliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambassa
dor designate, conferred briefly, but
in the absence of formal instructions
to the ambassador from Gleneral Car
ranza no definite steps were taken
toward beginning the proposed nego
tiations for settlement of differences
between the two governments.
The conference was an informal
talk and followed the ambassador's
visit to the department with further
advices from his government regard
ing the operations of Villa bands near
Corralitos, Mex.
The de facto authorities, Mr. Arre
dondo said, had secured more definite
information to the effect that the
bandits were headed toward Boquillas
or some point near there on the Texas
border. The ambassador renewed the
warning previously given American
military authorities, and gave assur
ances that Carranza troops would
make every effort to check the at
tempted raid.
The substance of the message was
forwarded to General F'unston.

July 11.-The first of Minnesota's men
are off for the front.
While men of the other regiments
looked on and shouted assurances of
a reunion soon on the border the Third
regiment broke camp and entrained
for the Southwest.
S There were no false ideas of glory
to be won by the members of the I
Third as they swung through the Fort
Snelling grounds to the station. Guard
a ing the Southern border of the United 1
g States against raids by bandits from

youngsters realized, but there was no
lack of enthusiasm, all were eager to

r cleaned up and over with as soon as

Most of those who took the trains
at Camp Bobleter for Texas were
youngsters, many of them seeming no
tl older than school boys, yet all capable

BIG SUGAR BEET MEETING
HELD IN RONAN TUESDAY
The meeting held in Scearce's
hall on Tuesday afternoon, to
sign up farmers who will con
tracts to plant sugar beets, was
attended by some 60 or 75 farm
ers, besides business men from
Ronan. The latter are much in
terested in securing signatures
to contracts for the reason they
believe it means the future pros
perity of the whole community.
The farmers showed every in
dication of being as deeply inter
ested, but so many of them are
still the owners of farms which
are not supplied with irrigation
ditches that only a meagre
amount of land was able to be
contracted for.
Present at the meeting were
R. M. Barr, agriculturalist for
the Great Western Sugar Co.,
W. W. Woods, president of the
Missoula chamber of commerce,
and F. M. Lawrence, secretary
of the Western Montana fair. All
spoke concerning the advisability
of securing enough acreage to
thoroughly demonstrate the feas
ibility of growing beets on the
Flathead and Mr. Barr explained
in detail every phase of the situ
ation. He would not approve of
any contracts where there was
not water already on the land to
irrigate the 1917 crop, and only
secured 220 acres. It is thought,
however, that 150 or 200 acres
more can be signed up in this

AUGUST FIRST
Rural free delivery route No. 2, iviX
be established running out of Ronan
on August 1st, provided 105 mail box-I
es are purchased and in position tol
receive the mail by that date.
This route is the one which will
supply that section of country known
as the Dir. Resner neighborhood and
atl that territory south of Ronan, and
will be 28 miles in length.
Patrons of this route are urged to
sign up for their boxes at once that
the postmaster may be able to make
his report in good time fcr the route
to start on the (late authorized. The
last day upon which the postmaster
may defer his report is July 26. With
two rural routes leaving Ronan all
sections will be pretty well served
in so far as mail delivery is concerned.
The route will be a tri-weekly.
The report is current that Hon.
Charles N. Pray is seriously consider
ing and that he may declare himself,
as a candidate for the United State,
senate to succeed Senator Myers
Having been in congress a number of
years and having a world of friends all
over the state, should he finally decide
to stand for the election, it will be any
body's race.
So far no one has openly announced
as a republicao candidate except Sen
ator John E. Edwards of Forsyth.
Others prominently mentioned as pos
sible candidates have either refusd or
are still considering.
An epidemic of infantile paralysis
has prevailed in New York City for the
past two weeks. Every effort is being
made to eradicate the disease and at
last accounts the number of new cases
each day was growing less. Many
western cities and some of the states
are endeavoring to prevent tie epidem
ic getting a start in their borders.
The total fatalities to date is about
23 per cent.

section and Mr. Barr says he
will recommend that an auto
matic dump be built at Ronan to
accommodate the farmers who
would ship from this point.
Mr. Barr explained the man
ner of operating, and told of the
benefits to farmers by growing
beets. He says that the land in
creases iri value, is rid of weeds
and wild oats, and after a crop
of beets has been taken off the
land that it raises much better
crops of grains in following
years. In other words it en
riches the fertility of the soil and
is helpful in many ways.
The Missoula chamber of com
merce is anxious to secure 7,500
acres under contract for next
year, as that amount will insure
the building of the factory in
that city. The contracts signed
here are for that purpose and
are predicated on the railroad
being built to haul the crop next
year. The contracts run for
only one year and every farmer
who possibly can should sign for
as many acres as he can handle
in hopes that the factory can
thus be secured. One success
ful factory in Missoula, with the
farmers of the Flathead making
money from this industry, will
result in building the at an early
date of a sugar factory on the
Flathead, which Ronan, in the
central part, hopes to secure.

CHEESE FACTORY
BEAN BESECUODED.
John Nadrau was up to Kalispell
and Echo lake last week and while I
there learned that Ronan can secure
a cheese factory if the people hi re
want such an industry and will only
make a small effort to secure it. He
says that Nels Salonder of Echo lake,
who is now successfully operating a
cheese factory at that place, will
build one here if the people will fur
nish him with sufficient milk to enable
him to run the same after it is estan
lished. That seems like a fair offer
and this paper believes the matter
should have the serious consideration
of both the people in Ronan and the
farmers contiguous to the town.
Mr. Naudrau says that no one makes
better cheese than Mr. Solander and
that anyone doubting this statement
can verify it by sending to Echo lake
and a sample of the cheese being made
there will be sent for trial test.
With the chances good for a consid
erable acreage of sugar beets being
grown here the coming year, it would
seem proper that our farmers should
prepare to put in dairy cows to eat
the beet tops which will be a waste
unless there is stock to consume this
valuable portion of such a crop. Beet
tops can be siloed and made avail
able for winter feed and taken to
gether will be the most profitable ven
ture our farmers could engage in
Sugar beets and dairy cows go to
gether and with a creamery at Poison
a cheese factory in Ronan would be
able to care for all the milk and cream I
which. the farmers could produce and I
at profitable prices. At present it is
stated that all cheese factories are
making money for the reason that
prices for cheese of all kinds has rap
idly advanced and everywhere there
is a big demand.
