On Their Way
to Sec Service
First Regiment Left Grayling
Encampment, Saturday.
Balance of Troops May Be Ord
ered Out In Near Future.
By Major M. J. Phillips -
Camp Ferris, July 10th. After a
wait of two weeks, the Thirty-first
regiment left early Saturday morning
for El Paso, Texas. The regiment of
1,382 men left in four sections. The
trains run one-half hour apart.
News that newspapers in Detroit and
Grand Rapids violated the censorship
hy puhlishing the story of the troop
movement before 24 hours after the
departure, as was agieed upon hy the
newspapers and their representatives,
aroused widespread indignation among
brigade and federal officers in camp.
The newspapermen were told, at a
meeting called Saturday night immedi
ately upon the receipt of this news by
&
Adjutant-General Smith, that any fur-
r violation will mean the expulsion
the cm respondent from camp,
Tv hither he is responsible for the of
fense or not.. It was pointed out that
the reason for the censorship was to
protect the troops from enewwes of the
government and Hiice a huge propor
tioii of the section men south of Kan
sas City wi r e Mexican both in blood
and sympathies, the ord r must he en
forced for the safety of the guardsmen.
Kaih guardsmen was provisioned
with 10 days rations, for the trip. ('apt.

train which conve) i-d besides his coin

pany ami machine gun company.
Colonel Waller Harlow hail charge of
the second section, comprising ttie
first battalion. Lieut. -Colonel A. C.
Pack was in command of the third sec
tion, carrying the second battalion.
The thrid battalion was in charge of
Major V. M. Dumas. There was 15 cars
to each train.
Camp Ferris, July 7. A wave of
pessimism is sweeping over camp.
Some soldiers who are not well inform
edthe average enlisted man and
most subordinate officers naturally
know little of policies and orders to
commanders of larger units declare
loudly that the Michigan brigade is not
going south at all; that we will stay
right here in Grayling for a few weeks
and then be sent home; and that they
will not see the service for which they
are pining.
Unless there is a complete reversal
of policy, they will see all the service
which they desire and some more, too.
Alter a month or so in the heat and
dust of the border they will pine for
the perfect conditions at Grayling and
wonder how they were so foolish as to
desire to leave it. Grayling is pro
nounced the finest camp in the United
States by regular officers who have
seen them all; and border service is
mentioned in tones of disgust by some
of these same officers.
There would be less pessimism and
impatience if it was not felt at first that
their stay here would be so brief.
Everybody was keyed up to go and go
right away. When day slipped into
day and we are still here, it became
somewhat of a strain to keep on drill
ing in the same old way while the
border beckoned.
Additional delay seems inevitable.
The chief medical officer has been
ordered to examine all troops for
vermin. That will take all day. The
secretary of war has directed that all
men with dependents be discharged
from the service if they so desire. Such
man who wants to get out and selects
the "dependent" route for putting it
across, must make application to the
authorities by hiscompany commander.
The latter has his say in an endorse
ment andf"7 n it comes up the regi
mental anMrigade commanders, after
which it is sent to the central depart
ment headquarters at Chicago for in
vestigation. A hearing, or some prob
ing at the home town of some of the
men, may be necessary. If all of this
is attempted before any troops depart
for the south, it will take probably two
weeks. This is not a guess on when
the first regiment to depart will leave,
however. The war departmedt may
'iycide that the investigations can go
on while the men are in southern
camps, as well as not.
The above order is the best proof
that service of an indefinite length has
been prepared for the Michigan troops.
If he were to go home in a few weeks,
there would be no necessity for dis
charging men with dependents. By
the same token, physical incompetents
would not be sent home, either. All
would stay here together, to depart at
the end of the aforesaid short tour of
duty.
Physical examinations in the 33rd
Michigan Infantry were completed
Thursday. Typhoid prophylaxis is be
ing administered and smallpox virus
is also being reratched in. New uni
forms and rifles should be in the hands
of all the additional men very shortly.
Rifle and pistol practice is being held
and the recruits are nursing sore
shoulders from the recoil in addition to
sore arms from the needle. The men
fire five to 10 shots, prone, at 200 yards
and the same number prone at 3(K).
The ammunition brought from home
station only is being used.
The malingerer who tries to escape
service because of alleged defective
eyesight and hearing is having a hard
time. Reports of a surgeon who has
scientific instruments which will prove
by the shape of the eye and the shadow
therein whether there is a defect. Of
course there is not. And while the
surgeon is fussing around with his tests
he gradually lowers his voice until the
unwary malingerer is answering ques
tions which are put in. Pack he goes
to the company, to face a wary court
martial and do police duty for a week
or so. And he doesn't escape service.
Company ' I" 3 5rd, Fist Jordan,
wants to thank Ihe home folks for a
bushel and a half of strawbeiries which
wi re received at camp, Friday. They
were d h' ioiis arid caused many a
longing glance from mi n of other ci.m-
a ' i i s. ('apt. Winttts fiars that about
1.") men will be lost on the examination
hut quite a number will be phsieal'y
re-examined in the hope ef getting
them through. The company had
sighting and aiming drills, Friday, get
ting ready to go on the range. They
will probably fire service ammunition
at the targets, Saturday. The com
pany has about $250, and could use
more before they leave for the south.
Private Frank Akins, who was
wrestling with Mile Freshwater of
Troop A, Cavalry, Thursday night, was
thrown heavily and was injured inter
nally, lie has been taken to the field
hospital. 1 1 is condition is not serious
and he will recover. The boxing
match between Robert Jones, also of
Company I and Pert Watkins of Troop
A resulted in a draw.
Clarence Clark and Herbe Gallaway
were on guard Saturday night. The
health of company members has been
excellent. Not a single person was re
ported on the sick list Saturday.
Close and extended formations mark
ed the drills Saturday. The men are
becoming unusually adept at field
maneuvers.
Excellent Features With
Sun Bros. Shows
An unprecedented attraction with
the Sun Brothers' Great Tented shows,
this season, is the introduction at every
performance of Ilerr Klotz's herd of
tango and pantomimic elephants. These
jungle giants give imitations of a brass
band, dance the latest tangos and tur
key trots, stand on their heads, play
base ball and bowl ten pins; they walk
ropes and perform many other equally
amusing and difficult tricks. They are
truthfully advertised as the most won
derful elephants today in America.
Besides this elephantine display, the
other attractions are all of a high grade
character and serves to introduce the
leading foreign and American artists.
"Tango Bill," the 110,000 high school
horse, also appears at every perfor
mance. This beautiful equine is hand
led and performed by Mile. Kelland,
the well-known New York horse
woman.
The Sun Show will exhibit at Fast
Jordan on Saturday, July 22nd present
ing two complete and unabridged per
formances. Afternoon and night. The
usual free exhibitions will be offered
on the show groends at 12:30 noon and
this season these are again all new and
of a highly original kind.

After the Lumber In
dustryWhat? Address Delivered at the Charlevoix County Bankers' Meeting
by W. P. Porter
President State Bank of Fast Jordan and Prominent Lumberman of
Northern Michigan for Nearly Two-Score Years.
What will be the condition of our
towns and communities where lumber
ing is the chief or prominent industry
when the timber shall be cut out and
the saw mills disappear? This question
did not occur to us twenty or twenty
five or even fifteen years ago when
large bodies of timber were tributary
to the mills and this time seemed so
distant, but now the end of the timber
is within the next five or ten years at
the farthest. When the saw mills shut
down, other industries which depend
upon the mills and the timber for their
fuel will close their doors.
The business of our towns has gone
along in one groove for the past thirty
five years and it is hard to realize that
a violent change will come about very
soon which may, and probably will,
:

W. P. PORTFR
have the most profound effect upon
the business life of our community
upon our banks, our merchants, our
working men and upon every owner
of real estate whether office, store
buildings or the homes of the working
men.
If a fire should sweep thru our towns
wiping out fifty per cent of the build
ings it would be a disaster which would
attract wide notice. Just as real a loss
and destruction of property values may
be seen today at Fast Lake near Manis
tee and at Flk Rapids and where loss
on the mills and plants instead of be
ing fifty per cent was ninety or ninety
five per cent. Depreciation of values
begins before the closing of the plants,
as the end is foreseen, but the loss is
no less real because gradual.
The gift of prophecy is not required
to answer the question what w ill follow
the going out of our lumber industries.
The answer is seen in the experience
of other communities like ours. Now
the question is what can be done to
prevent this slump in values. Look at
other lumber towns Muskegon for
many years after the mills stopped was
a dead town with empty houses and no
business. I remember one man who
works for us owned considerable land
on Muskegon Heights which was then
almost worthless, could hardly be given
away. Gradually, however, some in
dustries started there beginning in a
small way. These have grown large
and others have been added until Mus
kegon has grown to be large and more
prosperous than in the best days of
the White Pine lumber business.
Muskegon had no special advantages
to offer any of these enterprises, but
by hard work and good management,
they w ere secured and they are per
manent. If these efforts had been
made years sooner Muskegon would
probably have escaped the long period
of depression and loss which followed
the decay of the lumber industry.

men who are successfully trying to
bridge the gap, and have several good
industries well started and no doubt
will secure others which when the
lumbering is done, unlike the mills,
will be permanent. Cadillac also has
no special natural advantages to offer
any of these industries but that East
Jordan, Boyne City or Charlevoix can
offer. Indeed we have one great ad
vantage over Cadillac, that of water
transportation. We are also favored
with a rich farming country back of
our towns which Cadillac has not.
In striking contrast with Cadillac are
towns like Manistee where great for
tunes have been made from White
Pine and salt, but the millionaires have
taken the money made in Manistee and
gone elsewhere to live. It follows that
in a short time Manistee will probably
be almost as deserted city as East
Lake.
I believe our true policy is to devel.
op the resources we have and to build
up industries already here rather than
trv, by offering bonuses, to draw away
industries from other towns, which to
me seems acontempible form of piracy.
We have a fine farming region sur
rounding us. It seems to me the farm
ing industry is in its infancy here and
is capable of great expansion, especial
ly along the lines of potato and fruit
raising.
I believe good roads are a great fac
tor in the development of the farming
industry and if we may judge by the
experience of othws, a good competent
live County Farm Agent would be of
great help. According to government
statistics the average potato crop of
Maine, where potatoes are scientifically
and systematically raised, is about
three times that of Michigan. It is a
fact that our farmers are not very
prosperous as a class and the farms as
a rule are becoming poorer. They
need the advice of experts as to the
best way to bring up their farms. Many
farmers also lack capital and if this can
be supplied on reasonable terms to
those who can and will make good use
of it, it will set them forward years of
time and contribute much to the gener
al prosperity.
I believe far too little attention has
been given to beautifying and improv
ing our town especially is this true of
East Jordan and Boyne City. Charle
voix has done much more in this direc
tion and is well repaid for all she has
done. There is nothing which will
bring better cash returns on the in
vestment than money well expended
in improving and beautifying our
homes and our streets and public
places.
With our towns made attractive with
good roads leading to the farms and
with the system of good roads now be
gun between the towns, completed,
summer resorters would be attracted
and the time should soon come when
the shores of our beautiful lakes will
be lined with the cottages of summer
visitors.
Speaking of industries, I believe the
small indnstry, employing from 3 to 12
men, should be as heartily welcomed
and should receive as much encourage
ment as the larger, for it may be the
plant from which shall grow the great
tree. It is much better to have a num
ber of small diversified industries than
to have just one great one, employing
a large number of men.
We may prevent largely perhaps
entirely, the depression and loss which
naturally follows the closing of the saw
mills. Two ways are open to us we
may drift along until the end and find
ourselves in the condition of Elk
Rapids or East Lake or we may follow
the example of such towns as Cadillac.
Which course shall we take?

Republican
Banquet
To Be Held Here Week of
August 7th.
A number of the members of the
Charlevoix County Republican Club
met at Att'y D. II. Fitch's office
in this city, Tuesday night and made
preliminary arrangements for the
annual banquet. It was decided to
hold the affair at East Jordan during
the week of August 7th, the exact date
to be left to the executive committee.
O'ficers of the Club are:
President Att'y A. G. Urquhart of
Boyne City.
Secretary Att'y D. II. Fitch of East
Jordan.
Treasurer Att'y R. L. Lewis of
Charlevoix.
Upon motion the president appointed
J: M. Harris of Boyne City, R. A.
Emrey of Charlevoix and Att'y M. E.
Silverstein of Boyne City a committee
to secure speakers for the occasion.
It was also decided that the officers
of the Club should constitute an invita
tion and publicity committee.
The other arrangements, which will
mean a lot of work, was left entirely to
the Republicans of East Jordan. This
is a presidential year and keen interest
is manifest in politics everywhere. It
is estimated that East Jordan will have
the pleasure of entertaining between
thnee and four hundred on the night of
the event, and the big question just
now is to secure a place that will be
commodious enough.
Among those from out of town who
were here Tuesday night were the fol
lowing: A. G. Urquhart, J. M. Harris,
E. A. RuegsVgger, M. E. Silverstein,
F. D. Thompson and Ed. Lorch of
Boyne City; R. L. Lewis, Chas. Novak,

Messrs Felts and Nevis, of Charlevoix;
II. L. Barnum and Samuel Alexander,
of Ironton; and F. A. Kenyon from
Mackinac Island.
Wiley-Ward Nuptials.
On Wednesday, June 21, at high noon
at the home of Mr. and Mrs. George II.
Wiley, occurred the marriage of their
daughter, Florence Anna, to Kenneth
K. Ward, of East Jordan. As the
"Lohengrin March" was being played
by Mr. George Taylor, the bridal party
ascended from the stairway into the
parlor, where under an arch of roses
the ceremony was performed by Rev.
Brown. The bride wore a very pretty
dress of taffeta and shadow lace and
carried an arm bouquet of pink carna
tions. Miss Gracie Wiley was bride's
maid and wore a beautiful dress of
white net and carried a shower bouquet
of sweet peas. Little Vera Taylor
carried the ring in a basket. Sherman
Wiley acted as best man. After the
ceremony a three course dinner was
served in the dining room which was
decorated with pink and white. Oceans
of flowers were to be seen throughout
the house. The couple left for a
wedding tour then will return to their
home in East Jordan, where Mr. Ward
is employed on the D. & C. R. R. The
bride is one of Isabella county's highly
respected young ladies. Her entire
time has been spent in school work.
The bride received many beautiful and
useful gifts. Those from out of town
were Mr. and Mrs. George Taylor and
family of Beaverton. Mt. Pleasant
Times.
