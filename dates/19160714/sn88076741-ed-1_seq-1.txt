OFFICIAL PAPER OF CITY
WABDWBU TKOHPBOIT.
P- A. Wardwell. G.G. Thompson
THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
For the past week there has been little
developed on the fronts in either the
east or in the west. The Russians have
been gaining considerable ground over
the Austrains but heavy reinforcements
on the part of the Austrians and Ger
mans seems to have brought a check to
their progress. According to reports
the Austrian army which was reinforced
by several divisions taken from the
Italian frontier brought this set back
but the Italians have been making en
roads from the south and the greater
portion of these troupes had to be sent
back to check the progress of the Italian
army.
In the west the English and the
French armies have been continuing
their aggression and have gained con
siderable ground since their forward
movement two weeks ago. Late reports
however show that the Germans are
stubbornly contesting every trench and
have retaken several of them ceded to
the allies at the beginning of their drive,
At Verdun the Germans still continue
on the aggressive but the situation is
but little if any changed.
That it is the intention of the allies to
force the issue to a close as speedily as
possible there seems to be but little
doubt now, but how successful they will
be remains to be seen
The landing of the German submarine
"Deutscbland" in the Baltimore harbor
last Monday morning with a cargo of
9100,000,000 worth of die stuff and other
product from Germany may be a prelude
to a crimp in the blockade of England.
It will open commercial traffic between
here and the belligerent countries to a
considerable extent. This was a trial
trip but it proved that one of these un
der sea crafts can be equipped for exten
sive journeys and if the war continues
the submarine traffic will increase in
proportion. Captain Koning's report of
the trip is interesting. The Deutsch
laod.left Bremen, Germany on June24th
and landed at Baltimore Julf 10th,
twenty seven days, seven of which they
lay still be low the surface await
ing mors favorable weather and keeping,
out of the way for blockaders. There is
no question but that there will be more tlect Republicans in New York, Ohio,
vigilence kept by the blockading powers Maine, New Jersey and Indiana. Vic­

OUR METHODS WITH MEXICO.
There are certain aspects of the Mex
ican situation that all American eitisens
should keep in mind. We have been
greatly occupied with Mexican affairs
while assort that we were standing aloof
in order to allow Mexico to fight it out
and adjust her own future. We forced
Huerta's downfall by impacable opposi
tion, exhibited in many forms and in
eluding the seisure by naval and mil
itary force of Mexico's chief seaport,
Vera Cruz. We favored the Carranza
Villa movement and supplied it with
arms and ammunition. Later on we
favored Villa in bis warfare against Car
ranza. When Villa failed we gave
countenance to Carranza and recogniz
ed him as head of the de facte govern
ment. The Villa elements were reduced
to a state of marauding and brigandage
in northern Mexico. Our abandonment
of them and refusal to supply them
with munitions embittered them, and
tbey «ought to embroil us with the Car
ranza government. In this purpose they
were remarkably successful because of
our lack of a definite policy of our own,
and our apparent inability to adjust our
selves to facts and conditions.
Since we had undertaken to guard
our frontier, we might have guarded it
well. Instead of which we guarded it
badly. The bandit attack upon the
town of ColumbuB owed its measure of
success to the fact that the officers who
should have been on duty were off at
and another town partaking in certain
social festivities.
To chase the bandits across the line
and pursue them was so obviously pro
per that nobody of trained intelligence
would pause to discuss the question,
And this was what our soldiers actually
did on the day of the raid. But the an
thorities at Washington proceeded to do
something wholly different. They
strained all the existing resources of our
regular army to organize a military ex
pedition for the invasion of Mexico.
Preparations occupied a number of days.
Villa and his appearing and (disappear
ing little group of bandits were by that
time hundreds of miles away, with inac
cessible hiding places always available
in mountain mazes where the few in
habitants were Villa's friends. With
out the consent and against the- protest
of the government of Mexico which we
had recognized, we proceeded with a
British-like valor and a British like
stupidity, with a sufficient equipment,
to march southward about 300 miles into
the heart of Mexico. We paralleled a
railroad built by American capital, which
we did not use because the Mexicans
forbade us, although it was highly ab
surd not to seize it and use it We
avoided towns and cities, having agreed
in advance to do so. This was three
months and a half ago. The friction
along the border became much worse,
because the Mexicans were highly in
censed, whether or not with reason.
We needed our troops to protect the
border but 15,000 of them were halted
uselessly on along line extending south
ward into Mexico.—From "The Progress
of the World," in the American Review
of Reviews for July, 1916.
SENATE MAY BE TIED.
Several months ago, in speaking of the
necessity of nominating against Presid
ent Wilson a candidate who could poll
more than the normal Republican vote,
it was pointed out in this column that
more than a party vote would be needed
in order to elect Republican Senators
from many States now having Demo
cratic Senators.
Of the eighteen Democratic Senators
above named it will not be defficult to
VOLUME XXXVIII PEMBINA, PEMBINA COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, FRIDAY, JULY 14th, 1916.
tories in those states would nnsssfe di
Democrats, sines Indiana eieots two Sen
ators. The Republicans also have a fair
ehsnes in Wsst Virginia and Montana.
Here all reasonable expectation end*
however, snd leaves the 8ensts a Us,
with ths Vies President fScing a pros*
pect ol really being a fsotor in public
affairs. Of coarse, Republicans can hops
for a Senator from Maryland and ons
from Nebraska bnt each results are not:
to be ooanted upon.
Nevertheless, either Maryland or Nsb
raska, in addition to the seven other
states mentioned, most be oaptured if
Hughes is to hsve Senate to work with
him. The struggle just beginning, there
fore, is£oot alone over the presidency
Its big aim must be to include all ths
states in whioh a senator is at stake.
Wfe© Knows George White?
Several months ago we received a let
ter from Mrs. E. Alice Camp, of Wash*
ington, D. C.. asking for relatives of one
George White, who was supposed to be
enlisted from Pembina and served in the
48th Highlander regiment and that he
was prisoner of war in Germany. No
ons here seemed to know at anyone by
that name in this vicinity who have
enlist, and we submitted the letter to
friends in Winnipeg to have them inves
tigate through the military organization
of that city for further information. We
are told that the 48th Highlanders mus
tared in at Toronto where further en
quiriea were extended but up to the pre
sent time we have had no answer,
Mrs. Camp stated that her daughter,
Madame Hugli Camp, who fey the way
has been contributing many interesting
articles on the war in some of the lead
ing New York papers, was a resident "ot
Bern, Switzerland and that Mr. White
had sent word by exchanged prisoners
asking to have his relatives informed
that he was a prisoner and if possible to
send him some money, if only a few dol
lars.
It may be that Mr. White may have
resided some place in Pembina county
when he enlisted. If anyone can shed
further light on the matter his relatives
may be found. The accompanying let
ter was received this week from Bern
and arrived here fourteen days after its
dating:
Bern, Switzerland, June 14th, 1916.
Mr. G. G, Thompson,
Editor Pioneer Express, Pembina.
Dear Sir:—
My mother, Mrs. E. A. Camp, has
sent me your address. She wrote you
on behalf of Private George White, of
your town, who enlisted with the 48th
Canadian Highlanders and is now a
prisoner of war in Gottingen, Germany,
and designated there as No. 27555.
You could not, I believe, find out any
thing about him in Pembina, but that
he really exists, and that he ie in need
of help, are undeniable facts. Two
weeks ago a trainful of British soldiers,
too sick to be kept longer in the German
prison camps, were transported to Swit
zerland, to be interned here until the
end of the war. Among them was one
Percy Whale, from the 15th Canadian
Battallion Regiment and also from the
prisoner's camp at Gottingen. He knew
White well. Whale's present address is
Hotel Berthod, Chateau 'Oex, Switzer
land.
The men in the prison camps have all,
up to now, received their bread through
the Bread Bureau in Bern, but sudden
ly Canada has decided to send it out
direotly from London to her contingent.
From one day to another, 13,000 Canadi
an names were struck from the lists hers
and the London arrangement has gone
through such a series of hitches that
the most pitiful appeals come from the
men, who don't understand at all why
suddenly their supply of bread has
ceased. By the time this reaches you
probably everything will be in order
again, but the friendless ones like White,
have to.go without, until the new ar
rangements work. Others, like my own
"god-child" are receiving bread in the
meantime, paid for by their "god
mothers."
But at all times the men need tobacco,
soap, toothpowder, and above all things
to read—of which, of course, the maga
zines must date before the war. The
men who have returned from the prison
camps tell tales of their detention there,
almost too gruesome to re-tell while
there are still so many left in the power
of the Huns. Anything to alleviate the
pains of those still in durance will be
cheerfully forwarded by me. or by the
enclosed address.
Yours very truly,
ETHEL HUGLI CAMP,
Louisenstr 45.

Bernese "Prisoners' Aid Societies" in

and Mias Edith Londergan took plsos at
Grand Forks on Wsdnesday morning
last. Ths following It sn seoount of
the hspyy event as reported in ths
Herald:
The wsdding of Mian Edith Londer
gan, daughter of Mr. snd Mrs. J.
Londsrgan, 918 Chestnut street and
Ralph C. Chisholm of Lokota, took
place at 6 o'clock this morning at St.
Mary's Catholic church. The ceremony

coll in the the preeence of the family
members. The bride wore her travel
ling suit of dark blue silk with hat and
accessories to match. Her flowers were

valley. Miss Jo Londergan, who was her
sister's attendant, also wore a blue silk
with a large black hat. Het corsage

tne valley. Dr. R. F. Kneeshaw of

REFUSING RICHES.
Chances For Making Fcrtur.es Mavt
Often Been. Turned As.ce.
It is not an easy thiut! to sa.v "No"
to wealth when it is ottered in baud
/u!s. but titeve are people who hare
done it. In the eighties the best kuow:.
and most popular actress in the world,
iwrliaps, was Mary Anderson, an
American who was as good as she was
iieautlful.
At twenty-eight she married and ha*
never since been tempted out of hei
retirement except for a charity per
formauce. In the hope of inducing he:
to go on the stage again an enterpris
ins American manager offered her
£60.000 for a season of thirty weeks—
a fortune in itself. The lady refused.
Calve was offered £4.000 a week t"
go on the vaudeville stage. Her wori:
was to consist of singing four songs—
two at a matinee and two in the even
ing—which works out at about £lo0 a
song. She also refused.
Jack Binns, who in the early days
of wireless won worldwide fame bv
sticking to his post on a sinking liner
and bringing help from the four quar
ters, was offered fabulous sums to ap
pear on the music hall stage and show
"how it was done." His reply was
t^iit he was an electrician and not nn
acitbr. So he "turned down" a for
tune.
Mr. Gladstone refused several for
tunes from enterprising publishers. He
would only write what he wanted and
when he wanted. Browning was the
same.—London Answers.
SHAKESPEARE ANQ SLANG.
Later Day Phrases That Were Used by
the Immortal Bard.
"Good night," a terse ejaculation that
has taken ranking position among the
slang of the day, had its source in no
less authority than Will Shakespeare.
It took a Hamilton college student to
discover that the magic words were
frequently used in Shakespeare a plays
and with as much variety of meaning
aB we have been giving to
"The idea that 'good night' has the
iqark of modernity," declares this stu
dent, "is a sad mistake. In act 1.
scene 3, of the first part of 'King Hen
ry IV.' Worcester says he will disclose
a matter of Hotspur which is as full
of peril 'as to o'erwalk a current roar
ing loud on the unsteadfast footing of
a spear.' To which Hotspur replies.
'If he fall in, good night.'"
Many other bits of modern vernacu
lar are from Shakespeare, the student
says, among them "Go to it!" "You
cheese!" "I am for you." "Dead .drunk"
and plenty of others.
And regarding that once very favorite
phrase "Beat it" the student says
this: "Every one from a former presi
dent to a newsboy has made use of
thiese two words. Yet in act 2. scene
1. of 'The Comedy of Errors' Luclana
exclaims: 'Fie! Beat it hence!' "—Hart
ford Courant
Thi Indignant Mandrill.
The blue faced mandrill which, or
who, has ended an unhappy life in his
solitary cage at the zoo was a victim
to: the human sense of humor. He had
a long, broad, light blue nose with a
pink stripe down the middle. The
noise always caused a laugh. And
when, in acute irritation, he turned
his back upon the inevitable guffaw
the bright blue thighs, edged with rose
color, raised a new shout of delight
He knew perfectly well that the laugh
was the laugh of derision, the third
ami lowest of the forms of human fun.
He visibly hated his visitors. Nature
had so colored him to enchant the
eyes of a mate, but men have other
eyes than hers. Swift In his days of
failure and despair might have looked
with the look of the indignant man
