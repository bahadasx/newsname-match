"Wo most cordially endorse the ef?
ficient representative course of the
Hon. C. B. Slcmp, whom we have re?
peatedly supported for a sent in the
National House of Representatives
and we heartily endorse him for re
nominntlon by the Republicans of the
Ninth Congressional District.
"We most cordially endorse our ef?

the Sennte, and Hon. E. II. Witten
in the House of Delegates and en?
dorse their course in the last ses?

IS POCAHONTAS DRY?
(Communicated.
PooahonUu, Va., July 10.
Editor Clinch Valley News:
Is Pocuhontas dry ? No, from ob?
servation it is not." Where are our
good officers? Have they gone to
sleep on the job or not ? Every day
it is great loads of whiskey being
brought in and also carried out from
a certain street, still our good officers
sleep on. Yet they cry revenue. It
seems to me here is the opportunity
if the officers would do their duty.
The "Ouster" law went, into effect
about two weeks ago, and we have
had two very nice Sundays, with the
exception of an automobile load of
whiskey last Sunday and I understand
our council passed a law a few days
ago granting the sale in our town on
Sundny of all kinds of soft drinks,
tobacco, cigars, gasoline and in fact
everything but dry goods and grocer?
ies. If your town is doomed to go to
the bail altogether, why not grant the
sale of dry goods and groceries on
Sunday ?
I do pray that the Lord may put
it in the hearts of the good people of
our town to put down the evil as far
as possible on the Lord's day, instead
of granting license for a wide-open
town as they have done.
Respectfully,
A CITIZEN.

TO "OUR BOY JOHN."
(A beautiful tribute from the Rich
_ mond News-Leader.)
John Drinard was only fifteen and
an apprentice boy in the News-Lead?
er composing room. It was his busi?
ness to assemble the "takes" from
the linotype machines, to "pull" the
proofs and to set some of the heads.
As men measure industrial achieve?
ment, little John was a tiny cog in a
great, high-pressure machine. Yet
there is not a man on the staff of
the News-Leader who does not feel
that the plant runs less smoothly and
less happily this afternoon because
our little apprentice boy met his death
yesterday in a treacherous hole in
Swift creek. The real measure of a
man is not what he does but how be
does it. In the great democracy of
Heaven the prince outranks the pau?
per only when his heart is purer, his
purpose higher and his devotion is
greater. The man who turns a little
wheel with faith and zeal and gives
his best to each day's task is greater
far than he wdio leads an army forth
and fails to consecrate? his all to his
appointed work. And so it was our
little boy John ranked high. He was
his father's son in energy, trustworth?
iness and mind. He was devoted to
the glorious craft he had begun and
he performed the humblest task with
j patience never weary and with en
! thusiusm that never flagged. Had
he lived he would have been a great
printer. But we loved John in the
News-Leader office not less for what
he was than for what he promised to
be. We loved him, above all else, be?
cause he never lost his smile. Wheth?
er you saw him in the early morning
while the men were waiting for the
daily grind to begin, or whether you
saw him, ink-besmeared, as he stood
at his case in the last, nerve.wrack
ing rush before press time, John had
always a smile?the smile of youth
unsullied and faith unbroken. Some?
times that, smile lit up the busy room
where thirty men were toiling; some?
times it reached where little John
would never think and soothed a pang
his own short life had not experienc?
ed. He is smiling yet, is our little
boy John, and Heaven is brighter
for that smile!

TAZEWELL, Vli
BLIND PREACHER
TO HOLD MEETING
Scries of Prayer Services !o Be
Held Preparatory to Revival
In Which All Denominations
Will Participate.
All the people of Tazewell, without
regard to their church relationships
will he gliid to learn that Rev. R. G.
McLces, of Chatham, Va., will hohl
another series of services in our town
this summer. Mr. McLces is remem?
bered us the blind preacher anil was
here two summers ago. All denomi?
nations were charmed with his splen?
did sermons. He i s? master word
painter. His style is so simple that a
child can understand. And yet bis
sermons are so gripping and so pow?
erful that, they are bound to live in
the memories of his hearers. There
is no sensationalism about his ser?
mons or about his methods; hut he
preaches the simple gospel with ten?
derness and jiower.
Mr. 'McLces has recently closed a
meeting in Salem, Va., and our town
is fortunate in securing hint again
for another series of services.
Last Monday the ministers of the
town held a meeting at which it was
derided that till the churches would
co-operate not only in the meeting,
hut also ia a careful preparation for
the meeting. The services will be
held in the Presbyterian church, hut
it is to be a union meeting. All the
pastors are behind it. And it is hoped
that every Christian of the town will
fool that. it. is "our meeting."
We feel the need of careful prep?
aration for the meeting; the need of
getting every Christian in town inter?
ested; need of having hundreds of
prayers ascending from hundreds of
hearts in Tazewell; the need of get?
ting the Christian people together in
just as many prayer bands as possible
In the two weeks that must elapse
f)Cf( re the meeting.

FULL PAY FOR THE SOLDIERS
WHILE ABSENT.
Full pay while absent; at. least as

they are leaving; anil the Company's
thanks for their readiness to do their
duty?such is the treatment accorded
those employees of the General Roof
i t Manufacturing Company, who have
been culled to serve the colors in the
National guord.
This Company, manufacturers of the
widely advertised Certain-teed Pro?
ducts, has twenty-one sales offices, A
j factories and about twenty-live warc
i houses over the country. Officials at
J the home office in St. Louis could give
no estimate of the number of men in
j their employ who would be called or
what (heir going would cost the com?
pany in continuing their salaries al
i though it was thought that tin;; might.
! be n considerable item.
I "It is as little as we can fairly do
! for these men." was the word seal by
by the President of tin Company,

.the summer at Oyster Bay, Long Is
: land. Mr. Brown has been consistent?

| pnredness for defense. As chairman
;cf the St. Louis branch of Ute Nation
|al Security League he was an h.stiga
i tor and prime mover in the great
? preparedness parade in St. Louis on
June 3rd. He is a graduate of West
j Point and his opinion on matter per
' taining to the country's defense is as
.much respected as is his judgment in
? the affairs of the company, which he
.has directed with such remarkable
'Isuccess. Mr. Brown looks forward to
i universal service, when such cireum
? stances as now confront the nation
? I will find every man fit and reudy to
! immediately take his place.
FOR TAZEWELL
Supervisors Will l'ut Stop to
Wholesale Robbery of St reams
?County Demonstrator tu
He Ke-Kinployed.
Tlic Board of Supervisors of (he
?ounty unacted a now fishing law for
the county last. Tuesday, which will
put a stop in tin- promiscuous drain
me of streams of the country of tish.
Tito now law as enacted is as fol?
lows:
'?Ho it enacted by (be Board of Su?
pervisors of Tazewell county. Vir
Ijinin, that it shall ho unlawful to
itch or destroy llsh of any kind 01
loucriptioti (except carp) in the wit
eis in Tazewell county in any wnj
?seep! by tingling with hook and line
with only one lioo't to the line, uxecp
that it shall be lawful for any persol
to use u net coinnfonly known as ;
"landing net" to land any black has:
brook or mountain trout or rain
how trout hooked by lawful ntlglinu
with hook and line; and that it shall
he unlawful for any person, in lishilia
in Tazewell county to use artificial
bait except the tly, with or without
spinner, and with only one hook to the
fly or line.
Any person violating any of the
provisions of this act shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall
he punished by a line of not less than
ten nor more than fifty dollars, or
imprisoned in jail for nut more than
thirty days, or both lined and impris?
oned at the discretion of the justice
or jury trying the case.
This ail shall take effect on July
20th, 111 Id.
The Hoard of Supervisors Tuesday
made the annual appropriation of 1(000
for the ri'-employment of a county
farm demonstrator for the coining
year, which begins with September
1st. Mr. Montague, the county dem?
onstrator, who has joined the Slate
militia in Richmond, will he re-em?
ployed if possible. His retention de?
pends upon his release from the ser?
vice. If he cannot return to Tazewell
within a reasonable lime, Mr. Moon',
the district agent, who was here this.
week, promises to send another man
here to take up the work where Mr.
Montague left off.
A number of farmers and graziers
of the county appealed before th"
Hoaril and expressed the opinion that
it would he n great, mistake to dis?
pense with the faun demonstrator at
this time.
The mailer of disposing of the re?
cent bond issue of Juffersonvllle and
Clear Kork districts, is still in status
(jUo and will likely remain in that con?
dition for sometime, The failure of
?I. C. Mayer and Company to take the
bonds, because of some alleged tech?
nical error discovered by their attor?
neys, was a great disappointment, to
(he road authorities of the county.
The Hoard, in connection with its
attorney, is still wrestlinir with the
proposition and some solution will be
found. If the bonds cannot he dispos?
ed of right away to some other bond
buyers, it is likely that the legality
of the present issue will he tested by
n suit.

Knoxville, who was pastor of Christ

European War." Dr. Brotlglon has

ed by those nations, and which was

GEORGE W. LITZ
FATALLYINJURED
Accident on Kit tor Lumber
Company's Train Koad in
North Carolina Wednesday
?Case is Hopeless.
Mr. A. /.. Litz received a telegram
yesterday morning from Gastonia, N.
C.. which slated ihm Mr. Geo. W.
Litz, who was in that isoction on busi?
ness fur tho Bitter Lumber Company,
bad been seriously injured in an auto
accident, and requested that relatives
ho notified, stating also thai an oper?
ation would be pei formed at once.
Later a phone message from Dr.
. d rot her at Welch, staled that th.j
operation would not be performed.
Whether this meant that the patient
coilhl not. stand an operation, or one
was unnecessary, is not. known here.
Mr. A. /.. Lit*, <d' this town, left at
once lor Gnstonia, to bo with hiu
brother.
Serious apprehension is felt here,
but it is hoped other information will
prove moii. favorable.
George Lit/ lives in Columbus, and
has been connected with the Hitler
Lumber Company for years, Tho
company has huge mills in North
Carolina, as well as in Virginia and
West Virginia.
A message yesterday llferilOOII to

TELEPHONK TROUBLE. ?
Miss Montgomery, chief operator
of the Klticflcld Telephone f'oiupany,
was here Ibis week investigat iug com?
plaints which have reached the home
ofllce from subscribers in this com?
munity. She made a canvas of all
phone holders, uml registered their
complaints, and talked over the trouble
whore any specific trouble was nien
t lotted.
The beginning of the investigation
originated with the Town Council,
w hich at ItII lasl meet ing directed the
mayor to formulate a cninplnint, which
ho proceeded lo do, und forwarded it.
to the Company's headquarters in
Hhteflehl, The complaint recites Ilm
suction of the company's franchise
in which the company is hound, under
a foiTolurc of f'1.00 per day, to keep
its lines, poles, ?.C., in good order
'and cflicietll service at reasonable
rates." and continues. "It (The UhlU
llelll Telephone Co.?, has failed and is
failing lo furnish the public oflicionl
service at reasoiuihle rates, and to
maintain its property in good order,
and you are hereby noli lied, &C."
Upon reeieving this communica?
tion, transmitted by the Recorder, Mr.
Itepass, (which communication was
never read before tin.iiuil), the
company sent Miss Montgomery, as
staled.
The reporter made a little investiga?
tion on bis own account, and all he
could gel was. that "sometimes I
ring and ring bill, never gel anybody."
another said "my phone tloilt work
well." hid the company had not been
I notified, ami so, as in the complaint
seid, by order of the town council,
there were no specific, only general
charges, and it was necessary for the
company lo send a special employe
here lo spend a day or two healing the
brush, to lind out. what, was wrong.
This paper holds no brief for the com?
pany, but insists that, telephone sub?
scribers should be reasonable and
fair, and make allowance for human
imperfections. The company has a
switchboard here second to none, its
lines are in good shape. They have
a force of several men with a truck,
whose business if is to keep things
in order, and will respond readily
and as quickly us possible to any call
for help or repairs.
It is to the company's Interest to
give good service. They make no
money by not doing so und if is the
general belief I hat they are trying to
do so..
Miss Sallie McClilltOck Ifl In full
charge of the office here, and is re?
sponsible for its service. Her as?
sistant is a young ladv who has re?
cently come into the office, and under
Miss Snllie's training, is rapidly be?
coming, says, Miss Montgomery, one
of the most efficient employes in the
company's service.
It is insisted thai tho Company
should do its best to give good service.
The subscribers should not demand ab?
solute perfection, apd when charges
and complaints are made another
word than "eflicent" should be used.
This word means just what the sub?
scriber understands by it, which may
or may not be correct.
Permit, a suggestion: when you call
central give the number you want,
not the name of the party or firm.
Don't stop to ask if its Miss Sallie
in central, but give the number. The
company has recently spent a thous?
and dollars for a new director". A
new or late subscriber name may not
be in the directory, there of cotirso
the name must ho given. We can al?
most guarantee, that if the comnnny
can find out wherein it. is "failing
and neglecting to furnish the public
efficient service at reasonable rates,
and to maintain its property in good
orih-r," that the defects will ho re?
medied at. once, as far as possible,
and this is all that can he, or should
I he asked.
