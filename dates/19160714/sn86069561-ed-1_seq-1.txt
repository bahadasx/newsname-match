The Money You Buy
Naturally you want full value for the money you Ve
had to buy with your brains or your muscles.
At this store we feel it up to us to give you clothes
that represent full value measured in brains and labor.
We offer you Clothcraft because its makers have
put 70 years of the most intense study and hard work
into perfecting the manufacture of medium-priced
clothes for men and young men
You'll realize, the moment you try on .a Clothcraft suit, what the
labor nnd brains of the makers have given you in clean-up styles,
comfort and finished workmanship.
We want to see you, and have you see Clothcraft Clothes.
