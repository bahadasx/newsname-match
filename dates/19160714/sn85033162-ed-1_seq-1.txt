over the hill to the poor house". At
the evenlnE session the following offl-
cers of Rhododendron Lodge No. 107,
were Installed for the ensuelng term:
X. G. Anna Matthews, V. G. Mattle
Carter, Secretary, Helcnla Perrln;

Linton, had taken great pains in direct-

nice luncheon and hearing a few
apeeches from the members present
and a short address from the president.
the assembly adjourned.
Sunday evening, Mr. Lamar Tooze,
of Ford's Peace Expedition, addressed
a' large audience at the Presbyterian
church upon this subject The folding
doors were set back and the church
was filled to capacity. Much fun and
ridicule have been made of this expe
dition and It Is generally believed by
nearly 'every one that It had no in
fluence what ever on the warring na-
tlons of Europe, but Mr. Tooze thinks
It did. Mr. Ford Is a peace man and
no doubt he was In earnest. He had In
his party, 186 persons and It was very
expensive but It advertised his busi
ness and that no doubt, will pay him
for all the outlay of money. He does
tin enormous business In the manu
faacture of the Ford automobile. .He
employs 21,000 men, among them 6000
ex-convicts and he treats his m?n well
and Is therefore popular with them.
'Mr. Tooze did not get off on the first
boat and by being late he had much
trouble In getting the necessary papers
and he could not go without them, but
after a time he made tha connections
at New York and sailed on the boat
Frederick VIII, reaching ChrUMana
two days before tha other party. He
was determined to go and there fore
went He was selected to represent

He was gone ten weeks, visiting some
of the most Important countries of
Europe, among them, Norway, Sweden,
Denmark, Germany, Holland and Eng
land and came back well prepared to
tell soma Interesting things.
