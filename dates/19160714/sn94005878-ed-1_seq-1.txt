U. S. ACCEPTS
DIRECT PARLEY
TO SETTLE DIFFERENCES BE
TWEE AMERICAN AND MEX
ICAN GOVERNMENTS.
NOTESEHTTOCARRAHZA
JOINT BOARD TO STUOV WHOLE
MEXICAN PROBLEM MAY RE
SULT FROM MESSAGE.
Washington, July 8 A note formal
ly accepting Gen. Carranzas proposal
that differences between the I'nited
States and the de facto government of
Mexico be settled by direct negotia
tions was handed lo Kllseo Arredondo,
the Mexican ambassador designate.
Secretary of Slate Ijinsiug took a
draft of the note to the cabinet meet
ing and had It delivered promptly
after the cabinet adjourned. The
course to bu pursued already had been
agreed upon by President Wilson and
his advisers.
The text of the note follows:
"Sir: I have the honor to acknowl
edge the receipt of your communica
tion of July 4, l 10. In which you
transmit a note addressed to me by
the secretary of foreign relations of
your government, and to request that
you transmit to him the following
reply:
"Mr. Secretary: I have the honor
to acknowledge the receipt of your
courteous note transmitted to me by
Señor Arredondo on the 4th instant,
in which you refer to my notes of
une 20 and June 25, and to assure
on of the sincere gratification of ni y
government for the frank statement of
the difficulties which have unfortu
nately arisen in our relations along
the International boundary un.l the un
reserved expression of the desire of
your government to reach an adjust
ment of these difficulties on a broad
and amicable basis. The same spirit
of friendship and of solicitude for the
ontinuaiice of cordial relations lie
wee ii our two government Inspired
my government, which equally desires
an immediate solution or the Hitter
enees which have long vexed both gov
ernments. 'It is especially pleasing lo my
government that the de facto govern-
nn nt of Mexico is disposed to give
quick e.s well as practical considera
tion In a spirit of concord to the
remedies which muy be applied to the
existing conditions. Reciprocating the
same desire, the government of the
I'nited States Is prepared Immediately
to exchange views as to a practical
plan to remove finally and prevent a
recurrence of the difficulties which
have been the source of controversy.
"Accept, Mr. Secretary, the renewed
assurance of my highest considera
tion.
"I am, sir, yours very sincerely,
ROIIKIIT LANSING."
The series of conferences between
Counselor Polk of the State Depart
ment and Arredondo, for which the
note doubtless prepares the way, may
extend beyond the question of pro
tecting the border against future ban
dit rams and go into the sore need of
the Canaliza government for financial
support.
This possibility created considerable
Interest among administration offi
cials mill diplomats. It was regarded
as an Indication that the I'nited
Stales wishes to help the neighbor re
public to bring order out of its in
ternal turmoil.
On instructions from Gen. Carranza,
the Mexican embassy Friday advised
the State Department of the virtual
(lest ruction of a de facto government
force Wednesday by a large Villa
band at Corralitos, Chihuahua, and
suggested that the American border
patrol exercise all possible vigilunco
to prevent the outlaws from raiding
Into the United States.
In his dispatch to tho embassy, Gen
Carranza said he feared the bandits
had crossed the desert in un attempt
to reach the border and cause further
difficulties.
He suggested that the American
troops patrol carefully between Ho
quillas and Ojinaga and promised that
every possible effort would be made
by his forces to apprehend and de
stroy the bandits.
At the same time the State Depart
ment received a report from an Amer
ican in Mexico that he had seen and
talked with Villa personally near Cor
ralitos, a few days before the fight re
ported In the Carranza message.
Andres Garcia, Mexican consul, said
reports of the Vlllisln movement re-
reived at the American frontier points
have been greatly exaggerated.
