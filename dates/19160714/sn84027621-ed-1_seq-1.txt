City and Railroads Almost bat Not
Quite Get Together on the Union
Station Site
J. C Murchison, division superin
tendent of the Atlantic Coast , Line
railroad, told city council ,v yesterday
afternoon that his road was ready to
make ;a "liberal contribution" of $7,
000 toward moving the union station
from its present site to the Masters
property. As the estimate, made by
the contractor for the station and the
engineer of the Seaboard Air Line, for
the removal amounted to $5,400, the
proposition made by the Coast Line
falls $700 short of covering half of
the cost of moving. It was evident
that there would be another delay be-;
fore reaching a final decision in the
matter. '
President Nash, of council,' said
that he had received a bid of $3,500
for the moving of the station from G.
K. Williams. Mr. Williams, President
Nash; aidr would move -the building
from its present location and place it
on the Masters property in exactly the
same condition it now is. This esti
mate was $1,900 lower than that of
the contractor and the Seaboard engi
neer, and the question was raised as to
whether the contract could be given to
Mr. Williams. .
At the instance of Councilman J. J.
Gerig, T. W. . Parsons, division super
intendent of the Seaboard Air Line,4
who was present, was asked by council
to wire W. L. Sedden, vice president of
the road, to find out whether a con
tract with Mr. Williams would be
agreeable to the Seaboard and to the
contractor for the station.
President Nash was given authority
to handle the matter with Mr. Par
sons, and to obtain authority from the
railroad, commission for the removal
of -the station once arrangements are
made with the railroads.. Should it be
necessary, it was agreed that Presi
dent' Nash call 'council in special ses
sion again.
Mr. Parsons, who had suggested
taking the matter up with Mr. Sedden,
left for Tampa last night, having
agreed to wire the vice president.'

Importance of Jitney Line to People
of Ocala Can't be Over
s . estimated
-The importance of having a jitney
line to Silver Springs, Lake Weir and
Orange Lake is not to be easily over
estimated. These beautiful bodies of
water have been pointed to as this
city's principal sources of recreation,
providing bathing, boating and fishing
for the people of the city and for the
tourists. Yet up to this time there has
been no convenient and cheap means
of getting to and from Silver
Springs and the two lakes.
Charles H. Nash Jr. said this after
noon that the Seminole Motor Bus
company had complied with the re
quirements of the city, and was ready
to begin the operation of .its jitneys.
.Test trips were made to Lake Weir
and Silver Springs yesterday after
noon and to Mcintosh this morning.
The route that the jitneys will run in
the city, and the schedules to be main
tained between Ocala, Silver Springs,
and Lake Weir have not been definite
ly determined. The company expects
to begin making regular - trips ; on
Monday. Mr. Nash said that the Mc
intosh run had not been decided on as
yet, but was being figured on.
Trips will be made to Silver Springs
tonight, leaving the courthouse square
at 7, 8 and 9 o'clock. Tomorrow trips
will be made to the Springs every hour
from 8 a. m. to 10 p. m. Many of the
Seaboard picnic party will probably
take advantage of this. To Lake Weir
the bus will make trips tomor
row, leaving the square at 8 a. m. and
5 p. m., and on the return, leaving the
lake at 9:30 a. m. and 6:30 p. m.
