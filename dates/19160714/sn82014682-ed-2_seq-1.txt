frank statement that the militia of

, Some of the many Hawaii people
who have swooped down on this city
recently visited the War Department
and discussed ?lhe Whitener report
: They : pointed out Its harshness and
inaccuracies. AJ1 cf them spoke a
word of, two of tzz'.e for the militia.
In turn they were assured that the re

dlolomatlc and Quiet manner possible.
Officials said It would bring the sub

steps were taken to punish Lieut
Whitener for making the report and

So serious and horrible are the de

clearing the shbre-watef a ' of sharks,
and the government' will officially
warn the beach resorts of the prox
