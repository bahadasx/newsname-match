The Mexican Situation At It Appears
To An Ohio Citiien Americanized
Mexicans A Thousand Miles of
Mexican Boundary Why Inter
vention Mast Come Eventually.
By C. J. Thompson, of Defiance, 0.
The great Santa Fe Railroad sys
tem with a trackage of eleven thous
and miles, and the Southern Pacific
System with an equal or larger track
age, inclusive of a Mexican line from
JNogales down the west coast of Mexi
co each employ Mexican laborers.
They handle a pick and shovel as if
they had - always used them and are
amazed at the size of their pay. The
success, of these western roaas has
encouraged the Pennsylvania system
to supplant its Italian section hands
with men from beyond the Rio
Giande who have .been used to the
wages of slaves; so that real money
in a land where they can spend it as
they please is a college education, an
opportunity for these miserable peons.
For one thousand miles Uncle Sam
touches elbows with Mexico a coun
try seventeen times as big as the
State of Pennsylvania and nearly
.twice its population. Out of Mexico's
fifteen millions inhabitants how many
have come to live in the United
States T Only fourteen thousand in
1914. In that same year one Million,
two hundred thousand- other imme
gtants 'landed in America. However,
there are many Mexicans located in
Southern California. The cities of
Cotton and San Bernardino each have
sections of their respective munici
palities inhabited almost exclusively
by .them. They are loyal to the Unit
ed States. At the Southern Pacific
depot, Colton, when the California
Coop trains passed through, recent
, ladened with United States sol
diers going to fight their former
countrymen these Americanized Mexi
cans mingled with the crowds and
cheered the troops as lustily as any
.native son of the Golden West.
At San Bernardino lives a phy si
can by the name of Trevino. He is
a brother of the General Trevino of
Carransa's army. At Colton, across
the street from my son lives a high
toned Spanish family who settled
here several years ago. They migrat
ed from the city and state of Chihau
fcau. At Uie beginning of the revo
lution the head of the family sold out
all his business interests to his part
ner at Chihauhau who remained
there. The partner was a millionaire.
Today he is a pauper lost every
thing by reason of -frequent conscrip
tions from de facto governments. The
family of the other man - lives in
peace and security at Colton, South
ern, California. ' ,
'A taste of American life, a taste
of our high wages, free ' living and
free schools, a taste of our better
health and clothes, and a taste of
their chances which other foreigners
are swift to eis after coming here
Would soon make it hard to tart a
revolution in Mexico. What ails
Mexico and what ails the United
States that it fails to attract the
Mexican as an immigrant as it at
tracts all other peoples? Men from
England, Germany, Holland, Ireland,
Canada, Sweden, Wales, France and
Italy who have settled in America
have in one generation become not
ables. Who can recall the name of a
single Mexican who ever came to us
and achieved fame? They don't
come.
Did you ever stop to think that
from the year 1821 the date Mexi
co secured its independence from
Spain until .Porfirio Diaz became
president in 1877 the country had
never previously been so miserably
viceroyed or captain-generalized as it
had been Presidented? Between 1821
and 1877 it averaged five presidents
a year. Since Diaz was last inaugu
rated president in December 1910 six
short years ago the country has
had nine rulers or Presidents or First
Chiefs or whatever they may be call
ed, i In fact the country is sick with
anarchy. Intervention is bound to
come, notwithstanding that as I write
this Carranza ia for peace. His reply
to the latest American demands is
most conciliatory. Don Venustiano
admits .that conditions on the border
arw intolerable, chareeable to the
cresence of American troops on Mexi
can soil, he asserts. Yet the First
Chief expresses a preference for a
settlement of the questions at issue
by direct negotiation. Poor Old Don
Venustiano! Pitiably unable to ex
ercise -authority in his own govern
ment, even to controlling his military
commanders, he makes ludicrously
empty assurances that "Mexican
troops will establish peace and order
in Northern Mexico" and that "ade
quate measures will be taken to pre
vent a repetition of raids into Ameri
can territory." Of course no one takes
these assurances seriously not even
Mr. Wilson, whose blind attachment
to ideals based upon our own revolu
tion and blood-won liberty has led
him into regretable acts and humi
liating circumstances. But the Presi
dent quite likely will accept Car
ranza's conciliatory tone as a com
plete assuagement for massacre of
our .troops, murder of our citizens
and destruction of our property, not
to speak of the insufferable indignity
heaped upon our National honor and
American pride. His is a determined
policy to stay out of the blackened
country across the Rio Grande. Stay
out he will until he is overwhelmed
with the evergrowing demand lor
intervention, tighty-nve per cent, of
Mexico's population is illiterate il
literate to the verge of barbarity.
Moreover, this portion is congenilally
almost unfit for education. Govern
ment is a thing they are unable to
understand, unwilling to undertake
and incapable of exercising. The his
tory of Mexico itself is a magnificent
proof of this. Only under cruel dic
tatorship has Mexico remained out
of chaos. To a liberty-loving people
such as we are in America, this fact
is revolting. Brft it is too true to be
avoided. INEVITABLY INTER
VENTION MUST COME. Delay but
heightens the severity of the task
but lengthens the list of our Mexican-slain
dead but weakens our na
tional conscience at home and our
character abroad. MEXICO IS THE
WHITE MAN'S BURDEN OUR
WHITE MAN'S BURDEN. But when
will our President see it and realize
it? How long, O Lord, how long?

HUGHES CLUB.
From Fayette comes the news that
a Hughes Club of about 100 mem
bers has been formed under the initi
ative of Hon. C. L. Allen. Member
ship in the club is conditioned upon
signing the following pledge:
"We the undersigned citizens of
Fayette and vicinity, believing that
the welefare of the nation demands
and depends upon a radical change
from a weak and vacillating head to
a strong and positive administration
whereby the nation will be feared
and respected by all others, and be
lieving that the election of Chas. E.
Hughes as president of the Republic
will accomplish this much desired end
do by these presents form ourselves ;
into a "Political Club" and with this
end in view pledge our undivided sup-
port in securing his election.
This is a move in the right direc-'
tion and Fayette Republicans are set-1
ting a good example. A similar club:
ought to be formed in every village
and township in the county.
THE CLOVER LEAF TYER
Some injury is done each year toj
Ohio clover by the clover leaf tyer, a
caterpillar about one-third of an inch ;
long, which first appears in late;
March. It is so called because it ties j
the surface of the clover leaves to- j
Kether to form a cell in which it
feeds. There are three broods of the
! insect during the year.
Present harvesting customs pre
vent the insect from becoming a seri
ous pest. The first two broods are
largely destroyed by the two cut
tings of the clover crop, while fall
pasturing kills many of the third
j brood.
A complete description and life his
tory of the insect are given by H. A.
Gossard in Bulletin 297 of the Ohio
Experiment Station at Wooster.
When You Have a Cold.
Give it attention, avoid exposure
be regular and careful of your diet,
also commence taking Dr. King's New
Discovery. It contains Pine-Tar,
Antiseptic Oils and Balsams. Is
slightly laxative. Dr. King's New
Discovery eases your cough, soothes

MRS. GEORGE D. GREEN.
On Sunday morning July second
there passed on to Eternal Life a
woman who has so woven the last
thirty-six years of her life into the
life of this community that she will
be missed and mourned by many peo

Mrs. George D. Green came as a
bride to Wauseon in 1880, her husband,
George D. Green having been estab
lished in business in this vicinity for
fifteen years prior to their marriage.
During the thirty-six years of her
residence here Mrs. Green has enter
ed into the life of the community and
taken an active interest in its wel
fare and progress. She has been for
many years an honored member 6f
the local chapter Order of The East

in the years gone by to the success of
that organization. She was a mem
ber of the Woman's Club of Wauseon.
The Stratford-Shakespeare Class and
took an active part in all movements
that sought-the intellectual social and
moral development of the town. She
took real pleasure in extending the
friendly and helping hand to those
in need and thereby has won many
warm friends among whom she has
ministered with quiet and unostenta

of purpose and integrity which were
such important factors in the found

in reverent esteem she was an en

Dames and a Charter Member of The
Wauseon Chapter Daughters of The
American Revolution. In her life and
example Mrs. Green exemplified the
patriotism 01 ner ancestor Stephen
Hopkins, one of the signers of the
Delaration of Independence.
Mrs. Green became a member of
the Wauseon Congregational Church
April 4th, 1886 and during the thirty
years that have elapsed since then
this church has had no more loyal and
active member. Church duties and
church meetings always were placed
first in precedence by Mrs. Green and
social pleasure or tunctions were by
her, held to be secondary in import
ance. She was careful to-indulge in

be contrary to the principles of the
church of which she was a member
and yet she never presumed to set up I
her convictions and judgments as the
cnterions lor the actions of others.
Deeply interested in the missionary
service of the church, she organized
the young ladies of the congregation
in a missionary societv which for
many years accomplished . creditable
missionary work, and inspired its
members to consecrated Christian ef
forts. In her home her kind and help
ful character was manifest; a. lover
of the beautiful, she made her home
attractive and to this she added the
genial warmth of her own personality
making her home a delightful place
for those who were privileged to en
joy its welcome and hospitality.. She
was a devoted wile and kind and
gentle to all who were inmates of
the home with her. Her life here has
been a beautiful and useful one and
one whose influence for good will
long continue among those who have
known her.

Almerin and Mary Hopkins Sheldon,

According to guesses in the Census
Bureau the state of Ohio has 1,107,888
able bodied citizens of military age.
The number in the United States is
placed at 21,071,076. This estimate
is based on the assumption that there
has been an increase of approximate
ly 10 per cent, in the population of
the country since the census of 1910.
When that census was taken the total
number of male citizens and prospec
tive citizens 18 years of age and over
but under 46 was 19,183,000. Of this
number, 14,224,000 were native whites,
2,857,000 were foreign born whites
who had become naturalized or had
declared their intention of doing so,
2,052,000 were Negroes, and 50,000
were Indians. The number of foreign
born citizens is partially an estimate
since the census enumerators were
able to obtain - information as to
citizenship from only 1 about seven
eighths of the total number of for
eign born males. Native whites thus
represent about 74 per cent of the
total, foreign born whites nearly 15
per cent., Negroes nearly 11 per cent,
and Indians about three-tenths of 1
percent.

from the Commissioner of Pensions

vides that no person in the service
ct the United states m the Army,
Navy, Marine Corps, Revenue Cutter
Service or Coast Guard, either on
the active or retired list, shall re
ceive pension during the period . of
such services
"Membership in the National Guard
not mustered into the Federal Ser
vice does not affect right to pension.
This is true not withstanding the al
lowance of pay under the Act passed
June 3, 1916. ,
"Should a pension cease by reason
of entry into the Federal Service and
an application - for restoration - be
made after the termination of such
service, the matter of restoration will
be determined upon the conditions ex
isting at the time of the application."
Many of the Committees have prac
tically suspended operations for this
