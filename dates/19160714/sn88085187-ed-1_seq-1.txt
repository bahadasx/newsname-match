Although there aren't any olive-tinted IfoxfeMl takiiiK pot shots
across tlie lines, nor even any rebellious weapons in evidence, the
Taeoma harborfront is as carefully guarded today by armed lines
cf men as any section of tlie international lioundury.
< Excepting, of course. Calexico, where Troop B is stationed.)
With 1,20(1 Tacoina longshoremen on strike, and lho railroads
hrlMtafl reclmcata of strikebreakers into the city every lew days.
to work behind the hieh barbed wire barricades of the waterfront,
the docks are taking on an appearance of beleaguered fortresses
There are between 800 and 1,000 non-union men at work In
Tacoina today.
A total of 418 strikebreakers, mostly negroes from Momphiti
and the stockyards of Chicago, me employed at the Milwaukee docks
alone.
This figure was obtained from the pickets who have counted
every man entering the barricades. It was substantiated by police
oflicers.
Negroes have become the most popular class of strikebreakers
with (be employers. Not because they are a fast, ambitious lot, but
because they are patient, plodding and sure. It takes nearly one
and one-half as many MgTOM to do the work of an ordinary gang of
longshoremen, but the blacks are not so likely to take advantage of
their situation as are the white class of non-union labor. At least,
this is the explanation of the railroads.
A board fence. 10 to 12 feet high, has been erected nt the Mil
waukee rnilroad yards, paralleling the north side of 11th street
from the Icrininiil of the tidellats street car line to the east end of
the yarfl.
Timbers jut outward from the top of this fence, and four
strands of barbed wire are stretched on them.
Negroes From Stockyards
The fence is so stout that a dozen strikers, armed with a bat
tei-iiiK ram, would have difficulty in making an impression on it.
Great doors, guarded night and day by city police and private
officers, open on wroiight-iron hinges an inch thick.
Two Japanese Rteamers and a sailing ship are transferrlngeargo
at the Milwaukee docks.
The 400 or more strikebreakers, living in specially built bunk
cars close to the docks, do not leave the yards from one week end
to another. Their meals are prepared by railroad cooks. They bathe
in a huge shed fitted with 12 showers.
Policemen say that the men have all the conveniences of a
modern hotel, and a fine variety and quality of food.
AT NIGHT SPECIAL WATCHMEN OPERATE HUQI SEARCH
LIGHTS FROM THE DOCKS OF TUB MILWAVKEE PLAYING
THEM UP AM) DOWN THE HARBOR CHANNELS AND THROUGH
THE YAUDS.
Yet with all these precautions, and possibly because of them,
there has not been one report of violence at those docks and yards
since the waterfront strike began. -
Strikebreakers are brought to the Milwaukee in special cam
and steamers.
One hundred and fifty negroes from the Chicago stock yards
came in two special cars Wednesday, rolling past the strike pickets
and through the heavy gates without even a word being spoken.
Part of the negro population of the tideflats barricade were
moved in launches Thursday morning to the London dock, adjoinine
the Municipal wharf, on the city channel.
They immediately began loading a Japanese steamer with wheat.
High wooden barricades prevent the public from passing along the
wharf, while police guards at either end of the dock, and in and be
hind the warehouse, prevent the approach of outsiders.
Newspapermen aro not permitted on nny of the docks or in any
of the warehouses.
A few days ago I obtained access to the Northern Pacific
Oriental docks, north of the Pacific Cold Storage plant, however,
and found the place protected like an army camp in war times.
Double rows of fences and double gates protect the strike
breakers from the public. Every person entering the docks is stopped
between the two fences and searched for firearms or knives.
Many Minor Accidents Reported
On tlie water side of Ihe dock Is n long; train of section
cars, In which the Impromptu longshoremen lire housed.
Alongside floats a double-decked houseboat of large
proportions, whore the remainder of the workmen live.
I Ills hniis.-ho.il, erected recently for the ostensible pur
pose of housing employes of » new shipyai .1 on the city w«
tenvay, was really built by the Northern Pacific as a port
able home for non-union men—ut least, that is the use to
which it immediately v\,i- put.
At the Sperry flour mills, the Taeoma Grain Co.'s mills and
•long the lumber mill territory of the north waterfront, police and
private guards prevent anyone from using the railroad tracks sis a
right of way, or from loitering in the vicinity, without a police pans.
Fishing from Tacoma's docks has been absolutely ended, for
the simple reason that fishermen can nowhere find I wharf in deep
water that is not barricaded and protected by armed men.
Many minor accidents, due to the strikebreakers' iinfamiliarlty
with tackle and hoisting machinery of the ships, have occurred
■ince the strike began. Every day groupß of non-union men walk
out of the warehouses, abandoning their jobs.
The story is tidd of n non-union iiihii employed nt the
docks whose wife \i-ii.-il him this week with n bundle of
clean clothing.
She passed through the gate* nnd made her nny lo the

3 Captains, 2 Sergeants,
9 Detectives Affected
One sixth of the members of the Tacoma Police department, in
cluding practically all the higher ups, today were declared ineligible to hold
their present positions in a ruling by City Attorney U. E. Harmon.
The officers, who include two detective captains, a police captain, two ser
geants and nine detectives, either must resign, suffer reduction, or pass exam
inations for the jobs they now hold.
More than half of them, police officials admit, could not qualify for their
present positions under civil service examinations.
The decision is one of the most far-reaching rulings made in the Tacoma
police department in recent years and almost demoralized the force today when
it became known.
Commissioner F. H, Pettit is frantic over the situation. He either will
have to appoint men to high positions in the police department whom he does
not want, or will have to accept green material forced upon him by the civil
service board. At noon today he said that he had found no solution of the prob
lem.

"This 1b the most perplexing

are not suited for the work.
'"If I call for examinations for

non-clvll service promotions thin

were no eligible men on the civil

The civil serYlce board adver
tised examinations for promotion
to the positions or captain, ser
geant and detective in June, but
all of the police officers eligible
to promotion refused to take the
examination. They contended
that they were legally appointed.
Clerk Ellsworth of the civil

would repeat the call for promo

Immediate reductions in rank
