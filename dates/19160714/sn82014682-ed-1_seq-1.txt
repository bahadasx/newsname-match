VJKITKER REPORT
TO GE RECTED ACD DISCREDITED
Washington Correspondence" Tells of Sentiment in War De
partment to Relegate Document to Pigeon-hole as Unfair
Criticism
Rejected and discredited is the famcus "Whitener report" on the Na
tional Guard or Hawaii, according to news received by-the Star-Bulletin
today from Its Washington correspondent, CoL C. S. Albert.
. This report, made under date of November 11, 1915, charged that un
der the administration of Col. J. W. Jones aa adjutant-general of the guard,
there was deep-rooted and petty politics and official incompetency ram
pant In the organization. It reflected seriously on the ability of Hawai
ian officers of fte guard. Now it has been " discredited in Washington,
aays a letter received today.
The report was made to the divis
ion of militia affairs in the war de
partment and nothing waa known of
it in - Hawaii xcept in territorial
. government circles, higher up until
the Star-Bulletin on February 18 of
this year printed the news and. gave
portions of. the severest criticism in
full. Lieut,' W. envhitener. U. S. A.,
Traa inspector-Instructor of the Na
tional Guard. He has since been re
." lieved. "-"- ' - ..
Then followed, a series of explana
tions, denials, statementa and affida
vita which brought in the governor,
Brlg.Gen. . Johnson, head, of the
guard; Charles R. Forces, superinten
dent of public works rTJeorge R. Clark,
; former secretary to the governor; and
others. It was brought out that the
' Whitener report was printed here and
Forbes took ' responsibility for that
Delegate Kuhio addressed letters to
both the governor and Forbes defend
ing the Hawallans from the Whitener
charges. J
Kuhio, it was understood, also took
the matter up In Washington, while
Col. Jones and . other officer of the
Jones regime declared that In fairness
their names should be cleared of the
odium cast by -Whitener's report
' The aftermath Is given beldw in
correspondence from Cot Albert:

- Some. of . the cany Hawaii people
' 'ho have swfoped down on thls'city
recently TlEited the War' Department
and discussed the Whitener, report
They pointed out Its harshness and
Inaccuracies. All of them, spoke a
word or two of praise for the militia.
In tarn they were assured that the re
port would be disposed of in the most
diplomatic and -quiet manner possible
Officials said It would bring the sub
ject too prominently forward If any
' atepa were taken to punish Lieut
Whitener for caking the report and
the better course would be to let the
matter drop with an exoneration of
the territorial organization. .' . -It
nas been accepted as conclusive
by all those from Hawaii who called
at the War Department that : this
program will be made effective. They
expect to see a formal statement giv
en out praising the Hawaiian National
Guard and pronmnclng It efficient,
competent .ni fitted to perform any
emergency service, for which It may
be required.;

WASHINGTON, D. C July 14.
Probably for the first time in Ame
rican history, the cabinet of the Unit
ed States discussed ' the subject of
sharks. -
So sericus and horrible are the de
predations of the man-eating fish, on
the Jersey coast and elsewhere along
the Atlantic seaboard, that the fed
eral government is planning a cam
paign to kill the monsters.
Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo
announced after' the cabinet meeting
that his department will havej the
coast cuard service and coast guard
cutters do what can be done toward
clearing the shore-waters of sharks,
and the government will, officially
warn the beach resorts of the prox
imity of the man-eaters.
Secretary of Commerce Redfleld
said that the bureau' of fisheries is
unable to explain the sudden attacks
of the fish in the northern waters.
MATAWAN, N. J., July 14 The
body of Lester StiUwell, the 12-year-old
hov killed bv a shark near Mata-
wan, has been found It was bitten
nearly in two. ' -
' NBWYORK'N. Ti July14It Is
reported here that a number of sharks
are hemmed in Mata wan creek, where
they, have grown savage for food... It
is planned to dynamite the creek to
kill the fish. '
John Nichols of the American Mu
seum of Natural History, Is of the
opinion that the fish are the white or
tiger sharks, rarely seen In northern
waters. .' i ;

A suffrage plank will be presented

made certain this morning when a
meeting of the general committee In
charge of assembling the proposed
platform planks was held in the of
fice of its chairman, A. D. Cooper.

morning several of the general com

such omission would be a mistake,
that they favor suffrage, and that' the
territorial platform should favor it
The committee Informally decided
that a suffrage plank will be present
ed to the convention's platform com
mittee, but whether It will come
from an Individual delegate or from
thia advance committee on platform
framing is still uncertain.
Another important development to
day was a move for radical revision
of the taxation on autos. E. A. Berndt
proposed that Instead of taxing autos
by weight they should j be taxed on
consumption -of gasoline, telling of
