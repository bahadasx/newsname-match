THIRTIETH YEAR
CHAUTAUQUA
WILL START
TOMORROW
Comus Players Furnish
Entertainment for
First Night
TICKET SALE LARGE
Judge Wanamaker Will
Be Feature on Sun
day Program
Tomorrow evening will see the
opening of the Chautauqua out at
Electric park. For the seven days
from July 15 to 21, inclusive, there
should be a steady pilgrimage to the
big tent. Last year's was a mighty
fine Chautauqua. This year's, to judge
from the program, is to be a better
one.
The first 600 tickets at $2.50 apiece
are almost sold out. The second batch
of season tickets will go at $3. Sec
retary W. C. Mumaw of the local Chau
tauqua association, which guarantees
ticket sales to the Ellison-White com
pany, looks for the largest attend
ance that yet has greeted the Chau
tauqua on Grays Harbor.
The program tomorrow evening will
be put on by the Comos players, who
■will give scenes from Shakespeare's
plays and from "Carson of the North
"Woods." -Judge R. M. Wanamaker
will be the feature on the Sunday
program with his lecture on the vital
problems of our federal, state and lo
cal courts. Benjamin Fay Mills will
speak Monday on "The World on
Fire." Tuesday the New York Marine
band will be the feature. There are
many other features of the program
each day, copies of which may be ob
tained at the local offices of the Grays
Harbor Railway & Light company or
at the Hoquiam establishment of the
Helkel pharmacy.
Until a person looks over the list
of chautauquas that are being held
In all parts of the United States this
summer, the magnitude of the busi
ness is hardly grasped. It probably
has shown a greater growth than any
other institution of modern times and
each year the total Chautauqua at
tendance has increased 200 per cent.
To keep these chautauquas in op
eration requires the services of many
hundreds of people and the list of
men and women who devote all or
part of the summer months to this
kind of work, includes many of Am
erica's notables. Besides the hun
dreds of musical attractions, lectur
ers and entertainers, there are many
hundreds of advance men, college
crew boys and other assistants who
manage the immense detail of the
chautauquas.
The Chautauqua of today is operat
ed on a strict business basis, and un
like many other movements of the
present day, it pays its bills and fi
nancially is a success. When it is
understood that $15,000,000 was spent
last year in promoting the chautau
quas of the United States, it will be
readily understood that as an insti
tution is making good on a business
basis.
Judge R. M. Wanamaker of the Su
preme Court of Ohio, who will speak
at the Chautauqua Sunday, brings a
message of even greater individual
interest and importance than that of
n'fiiredness —a constructive treat
ment of the vital proMems of our
federal, state, district and local courts.
No man in America today is so ably
equipped, by reason of actual partici
pance. and demonstration of conten
ed principles, to point out the glar
ing weaknesses of our system of juris
prudence, and at the same time offer
a workable remedial solution to the
problems.
As district attorney, as Judge of
the court of common pleas, as judge
of the supreme court of his state,
Judge Wanamaker struck a new note
in the annals of jurisprudence in this
country. He proved not only to the
people of Ohio, but to many outside
thousands who were eager to familiar
ize themselves upon the subject, that
after all, the dispensation of equal
justice guaranteed to ever yone un
der the law, is a thing of simple and
direct method.
FIGHT TO KEEP
BOAT SHIPMENT
OF BOOZE OUT
The Hoquiam police, despite the dis
couraging aspect of the situation,
seem determined to put down the
practice of bringing liquor to Grays
Harbor on boats. The Aberdeen po
lice, too, have been just as energetic.
The last case, however, comes from
lioquiam in the raid on the steam
schooner Willamette, Sunday night.
The contention of ships' captains and
stewards that they have full right to
carry any amount of stock is yet to
be fought out in the courts.

LOCAL ELKS HELP
The local lodge of Elks is busying
itself with plans for assisting the Ho

gates to the Elks state convention
next month. The Aberdeen lodge
hopes to supply 700 rooms for visit
ors, but so far has secured pledges
of but 150 of them.
STRIKE UNSETTLED
Settlement o fthe longshoremen's
strike today seems as distant as at
any time in the past month. The Grays
Harbor Stevedore company reports
that it is meeting with but little diffi
culty in loading and unloading ves
sels here. Reports from San Fran
cisco, Seattle and Tacoma are not
so encouraging, however.
LOGGING CAMPS
OF HARBOR ALL
RUNNING AGAIN
All the logging camps of Gray*
Harbor, closed during the Fourth of
July celebrations here and in other
towns of the county, are running
again. Some may be a little short
handed still on labor, as many log
gers have lingered through this week
in Aberdeen, Hoquiam and elsewhere,
resting up from the Fourth, but by
tomorrow night, in all probability, all
probability, all crews will have re
ported for duty and next week will
see every camp running full blast.

CITY COUNCIL
PROCEEDINGS
Street improvement was the main
business at the Wednesday night's
council meeting and resulted in the
>rdering West Hume street paved from
Washington street to the railroad
tracks and in taking preliminary
steps for improvement of the portion
of Second avenue damaged by slides
last winter. The council voted against
paving D street from Market to Ran
dall, numerous' protests being made
to this project. The street committee
was asked to investigate the advis
ability of graveling the west end of
Heron street so the Federal mill
might have an outlet for its lumber
wagons.
The portion of Hume street ordered
paved is three blocks in length and
the project will cost about $7000. No
pretests were made against this pro
ject.
Efforts to stop the Second avenue
slide caused considerable discussion
and this resulted in the mayor, city
attorney and city engineer being in
structed to secure the permission of
the abutting property owners for the
city to put in drain ditches. After
this is done other necessary work
will be done to offset the damage
done by the slides.
Water Supt. George Bowen report
ed house numbering here to have
been badly done and Mayor Phillips
advised an effort be made, probably
by the water department, to have
all homes in the city properly num
bered. Where numbers have to be
changed a charge of 25 cents will be
made.
The council instructed the water
superintendent to refuse to install
meters at any place other than those
of regular consumers of city water.
North Aberdeen in winter is sup
plied with water from the numer
ous springs that come out of the hill.
In the spring, however. North Aber
deen residents need city water. It
was not thought advisable to install
long pipe lines unless the city would
be assured that a number if resi
dents of this section would become
constant users of city water.
Neinist & Rodrick were awarded
the contract, at a price of $400, for
painting both the Heron street and
North Aberdeen bridges.
Lawrence street from Curtis to
Front and the entire length of Stock
well Street, both in South Aberdeen,
were ordered closed, due to the un
safe condition of these plank streets.

CANNERIES SHOW
FALLING OFF FOR
SEASON OF 1916
Clam Pack Off 50 Per
Cent; Salmon Just
Above Normal
The salmon and clam packing in
dustries of Grays Harbor have fallen
off this season. The depreciation in
the clam pack is estimated at 60 per
cent, due to the scarcity of the clams.
The salmon, as figured now, is but
16,000 cases against 40,000 case* put
up last year. This, however, does
not mean that 1916 clam season was a
bad one. Last year's was away above
normal, and this year's is slightly
above normal.
There will be no salmon run of
consequence before September. When
that takes place all Harbor canneries
will be operating to capacity, prob
ably.

Low Record for ♦
Mortality Kept
Up By Aberdeen
Deatb Rate Here in Six Months Is
56 Against Birth Total
of 114
Aberdeen has kept up its end, for
the first six months of 1916, in sus
taining the low record for mortality
of the state and the high birth rate.
The June record, especially, is one
of which any city in the world might
be proud, four deaths and sixteen
births.
For the six months, January to June,
inclusive, the deaths in Aberdeen to
talled 56. Births In the same pe
riod totalled 114.
United States government reports
for several years have accorded Aber
deen a position occupied by only two
to three other cities of like or near
population, in the whole country, as
respects its low mortality. The year
1916 will keep up the record.
CLEARS OFF WEEDS
A start at ridding the city of some
of its dandelions and weeds was made
Tuesday. Mayor J. M. Phillips, un
der authority of an ordinance which
allows the city to do such work, put
a small gang of men at work in the
downtown section cutting off the weed
crop. At the same time he expressed
the wish that property owners all
over the city would join in the good
work.
MIGRATION TO
BEACHES IN ON
Aberdeen residents and residents of
all Grays Harbor towns, in fact, are
leaving in steady streams for the

iault are reported to be lined with
campers, since the completion of the
