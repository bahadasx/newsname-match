1 Savannah, Ga., July 11.?'Dispatches
^Konight from Bainbridge and other
B?wns in that part of southern Geordescribe
the flood conditions there
(as the worst calamity that has ever
befallen that region. In Decatur
county, which seems to have suffered
the worst, the damage to crops and
other property is now placed at $750,000.
The entire tobacco crop there is
ruined, it is said.
The Flint river, which overflowed
its banks Sunday night, has reached
a 27 foot stage, and with continued
h^avy rains today, was still rising toj
night, gradually extending the flooded
.area. Spring creek, which flooded
many thousand acres of farming land,
was believed to be slowly receding,
.! leaving destruction in its wake. In
the western part of Decatur county
the Chattahooche river has laid waste
to many plantations.

Georgia railway is stifl tied up west
of Albany, where Notchaway creek, in
W Calhoun county, overflowed its banks.
[ A great deal of damage has been done
\ in that section to crops, wnicn wers

bridges on the G. F. &A. and the Central
of Georgia railways in that section
were washed away. Much cotton

but trains are running far behind
schedules.
i In the vicinity of Valdosta, where
the Willacoochee and Little rivers
reached a stage higher than had been
feiown in a decade, the water was
falling tonight. The National highway
bridges across the Willacoochee
river and the Hagan bridge across the

SUBMARINE BACK
Koenig Makes Preparations to Carry
| Craft to Sea When Jiew Cargo
is Loaded.
Baltimore, July 11.?Confident that
the efforts of the diplomatic repre-j
sentatives of the entente allies to
have his vessel classed as a warship
I and interned will prove unavailing,
Capt. Paul Koenig, master of the German
submarine iDeutschland, is preparing
to leave port on his return
voyage within ten days.
Capt. Koenig expressed satisfaction
^tonight but no surprise when informed
that three American officers who
in a loft. He made the trip to the
barn but was drowned returning.
Southern railway trains between
Atlanta and Macon ran through three
feet or more of water between Jackson
and Macon during the night and
today.
The Macon, Dublin & Savannah
railroad has operated no trains during
the day. Water is over the bridge
at this point.
Another thunder shower brought a
third of an inch of additional rain to
this section this afternoon.
Many cotton fields in southwest
Georgia are entirely submerged and
the crop in some cases is being sold
as it stands. One farmer sold a field
that ordinarily yields 50 bales of cot
ton for one bale.
. Torrential Bains Cease In Alabama.
Montgomery, Ala., July 11.?Reports
from the various sections of
Alabama embraced in the flood area
tonight said that the torrential "rains
have ceased, and but little rain has
fallen since midnight Monday. The
clearing weather has given encouragement
that actual damage may be
minimized. So far the loss of life has
been remarkably small, and confine^
to negroes. The loss to the crops or
\
the State, as estimated by James A.
Wade, commissioner of agriculture,
will exceed $5,600,000.
"The crop damage in Alabama will
not be less than from $5,600,000 to
$7,000,000," said the commissioner today,
"and may run as high as $14,000,000.
This last figure depends on
the length of time the flood waters
cover the ground and the actual extent
of the damage already done in
the northern part of the State where
lowlands between the natural water
sheds are devoted to corn.
"I estimate the. damage, from reports
received, at not less than 10 per
cent, to 15 per cent. Many estimates
reach me that it may go to 25 per
cent. That estimate I consider entirely
too high. The federal government's
report last year placed the total
corn yield at 70,000,000 bushels.
This, at an average price of 80 cents
per 'bushel, totals $56,000,000. Ten
per cent, means a loss of $5,-600,000.'*
Tte greatest need for assistance developing
during the day cams from
the Selma district, especially in Lake
Lanier on the Cahaba river and its
numerous small feeders. Early this
morning Selma appealed to the United
States engineering officers here for 1
boat for use in transporting the people
from the storm district and to
-ave as much of their personal prof
erty as possible. The flood victims
volunteered to man the boats to pro*
vide the supplies necessary in rescuing
the other people and their effect*.
The towboat Alabama was sent out
immediately. The only information
reaching the engineering office is that
many families are cut off from help
by high waters from the Alabama
and Cahaba rivers around the Selma
territory.
All railroads out of * Montgomery
resumed train operations today, except
the (Montgomery & Mobile division
of the Louisvile & Nashville
from Mobile. This road is sending
out trains as far south as Bay Minette,
64 miles this side of Mobile. Through
traffic between this city and Jacksonville,
Fla., was resumed this afternoon.

districts high water still prevents
resumption of traffic, but condi

1 inspected the Deutschland today had
reported that not only was she an
unarmed merchant vessel now, but
was so constructed that she could not
be concerted into a warcraft without
virtually being rebuilt. Capt. Koenig
said he could only reiterate that the
'Deutschland, like other submarines
built or building for Germany's new
undersea merchant fleet, was design*
ed solely as a freight carrier.
At least eight of these vessels, it
was authoritatively learned here today,
now are building at Kiel, and
with these, in addition to the Deutschland
and the Bremen, already en
route for an American port, Germany
exnects in a measure to reestablish
her lost commerce and mail commun- (
ication with the rest of the world, j
Look for Torpedoes.
The torpedo being a submarine's;
essential weapon to make her effec-J
tive as a warcraft, it was the possi-'
bility that the Deutschland might be 1
pierced for torpedo tubes that was j
the chief concern of the American j
naval officers, headed by Capt. C. F. i
Hughes, who inspected the vessel today.
Not only were none found, but
an examination of the forward Dart
of the vessel's hull, "where torpedo
tubes naturally would be located, revealed,
it was learned, that the structure
was not substantial enough to
contain them.
Before the Deutschland could be
armed like a German naval submarine,
entire reconstruction forward
I
would be necessary. This fact was
sufficient in the minds of the American
experts, to warrant their decision

The possibility that guns could bft .

also. But there were neither guns!
nor emplacements in evidence.

"He is proud of his vessel and I
do not blame him," said Capt. Hughes.
"It is a wonderful piece of meahanism
and a monument to German inventive
genius."
If the Deutschland has any new
devices or mechanism which are new
in submarine construction, Capt.
Hughes now knows them. He would
not say if any such existed, but made
it clear in this connection that everything
tie wanted to know was frankly
explained. He had no instructions or
intention, he said, to report any
knowledge he may have gained.

that he expected to sail "within ten e

completed repairs today and took up -c
a position directly in front of the
Deutschland. When the Timmins en- e
tered dry dock it was reported that t
she was getting ready to return to c
the Virginia capes to convoy into the | c
Chesapeake, as she did the Deutsch- j r
land, the submarine Bremen which is ; c
said to be four days on her way to c
this country. d
The air of mystery surrounding all r
discussion of the Deutschland's de- ^
parture was deepened today by re- a
ports that her clearance papers may 1
not be made public when filed, thus c
preventing advance notice of her 1
leaving -being obtained.
It became known late today that ?
several conferences have been held t
here between the representatives of c
the Ocean Navigation company and of f
the Krupp steel company ana simon s
Lake, inventor of the submarine. This *
gave rise to reports that a company *
was in process of formation for the
purpose of carrying on undersea com- <
merce between this country and Ger- j
many and that Mr. Lake had been in- s
vited to accept the position of consulting

In the same region north of

to have lost heavily in their
attacks on Trones wood.
The French and German forces
south of the Somme apparently are
resting as there has been almost no
activity m tne region 01 ncaray since
the first of the week.
Around Verdun, however, and especially
on the right bank of the
Meuse, bitter and heavy fighting is in
progress between the forces of the
German crown prince and the French
defenders of the fortress. The Germans,
following up their success in
the region of the Damloup battery, .
have -undertaken a strong offensive
toward Fort Souville, the possession
of which would strengthen their po

morning and carried over the shoulder.)
Many hardships were suffered dur-^
ing the first few days and lots of the
boys longed for home and hot meals
which were fixed by mother's hands.
After the hurry and rush was over
things began to adjust themselves and
the enlisted men began to make themselves
at home, at it were, with only a
few of them kicking about the sleeping
quarters, food and the many
hardships which a real soldier must
put up with.
As a general rule the officers have
been kind to the men and have tried
to do all in their power to provide
all the conveniences possible and
have helped with words of cheer and
in many ways. Many of tlje captains
are sociable and try to make the
boys feel friendly toward them and
not to regard them in awe.
Drilling has been in style for the
whole time we have been here and
with the many recruits this has been
arduous and has given the officers no
little trouble but many of the new
ones are getting broken in and will
be ready to go through a regular
drill before they leave here.
The days here are spent, and the?
start almost at sun up, in eating,
drilling, cleaning the tents, making
the grounds look neater and in a
thousand and one things which can
be found to be done around a camp.
And the men are all about to get
uniforms and will soon look like reg
ulars. 'New guns have been issued,
in place of the old ones which were
taken up and the men seem to take
pains with the new firearms, cleaning
tkem continually. The trousers
which have been issued are of brown
kfcaki and the snirts are or an onve
colored wool. The hats are the regular
service kind and each one has the
cord around according to the service
which it is used in.
Each night sees the men visiting
dllU. tjujuyxug UitJ C<LUip xii.c jvja, ouxuc
sing, some play cards while many of
c'nem visit the several tents where
phonograph concerts are held.
Each day finds a new rumor about
when the troops will entrain and the
men are getting very anxious to
either go home or else set out for the
border. It seems that the story here
ha'l dampened the desire of many
to get at the Mexicans, for the life of
a soldier, in a temporary camp like
this one is far from the most pleasant
thing in the world, still the
.hardships are borne without many
kicks, but the fact remains that every
man wants to be moving, either home
or for the border.

are not as much relished as if thev
were better cooked and more of a

On a whole everything- is running

camp and getting better each day.
