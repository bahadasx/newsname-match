SELMER. McNAlRY COUNTY, TENN.. FRIDAY, JULY 14, IQI6.
NUMBER 2
The M. & 0. Dairy Cars were
here Monday and , Tuesday.
There were lectures and demon
stration each day in both - fore
noon and afternoon. The atten
dance was good, and many seemed
much interested in the advice
and suggestions given. .Tuesday
from i one to two o'clock, the
teachers Institute was invited
and filled the car. A. local buyer
of cream will be established here
in the near future.
- It now looks like the allies are
pressing the Germans and Aus
trians from every quarter. The
French have held the enemy in
check until the English and Rus
sians got ready and fully pre
pared with men and munitions to
make the onslaught on both sides
and from every angle. The allies
are growing in strength. - The
central powers were full-grown
at first and are now wearing
away in men. and munitions. It
seems from every standpoint
that the Germans are on the
western turn of the hill.
The arrival Sunday at Balti
more of a German submarine
with a cargo of dyestuffs, and to
return with the things they most
need in their war supplies, is an
epoch in the worlds war, That
a line of submarines is to be put
oh seems the German plan to have
access to the outside world.
They will not be .able to carry
any heavy supplies such as food
stuffs probably, but valuable car
goes, money and private and
public documents will be trans
ported, they will be able to pas3
the enemy by submerging, seems
reasonable. They are not armed
vessels, and the trade is ' legiti
mate and this country will en
courage it. ;
Because v articles appear in
newspapers and are marked
"adv" is no sign they, do not
state facts. It is not expected
that anything but party papers
endorse and use their columns
free in advocacy of candidates of
the opposite party. The Inde
pendent is an independent and
strictly a non partizan paper.
The claims of any candidate may
be made in its, columns, but not
endorsed by the paper. Last
week and also in this issue are
reprints from partisan paperS
strongly favoripg Mr. Sims' elec
tion in the democratic primary.
Mr. Sims cannot meet the people
and present his claims, and his
managers try to do so through
the newspapers of the district.
We have no hesitancy in saying
that Mr. Sims is a credit to any
district represented in congress,
and we doubt if anything short
of death or a republican will
vacate his seat in the halls of
congress. , He certainly is enti
tied to credit for his untiring
efforts , to discharge every duty
imposed on a congressional rep
resentative.
; ; District Confererence
t The opening sermon was preached
by Rev. Peeplea of Lexington Wednea
div night. The sacrament waa ad
ministered at the close of the Bervice.
There is a large attendance of min
inters and laymen.
NEW YORK
i ' LETTER $
"The Hand of the Law"
, Tuesday night witnessed the pre
sentation by home talent of this rath
er heavy play under the auspices of
the Ladies' Aid Society of the Bap
tist church. The night was threaten'
ing and the attendance waa not as
large as it would have been, yet it
was a remarkably large bouse under
the conditions.
-- The play was well staged and the
scenery appropriate. Interest in the
p ay increases as the plot thickens,
id the climax finds an audience
wrought up to a high pitch of inter
est.
: All did their parts well. Of course
Roscoe Alexander, in his inimitable
part, was the star for the kids, as
alo bis co-servant and sweetheart,
Mrs. Mary Peeplea. We think this
tha beat ula? of the season, and be-
Ann it should be repeated.
Once in Nashville I was introduced
to a young lady from Columbia,
Maury county, one of the finest and
most Drosperous sections in Tennes
see. When thi sweet thing heard
was from McNairy county, she blurt
ed out: "Why, I always heard that
McNairy was the poorest county in
the State!" There was no use in try-
ng to teach her that McNairy was
full of self-respecting, self-supporting
citizenship, and was by no means
the poorest portion of Tennessee. If
it had been my father instead of me,
he would, with his native wit, have
said to the young lady: "Perhaps so
but no McNairy lady would be so im
polite as to say that about another
county." I didn't think of that till
the next day, and it was perhaps just
as well, for the maiden had red hair,
and I had none to lose myself. What
did. tell her was that almost any
county was poor when compared with
Maury, but that we McNairians prided
ourselves on the output of men and
women, Second to none in the State;
and that I had seen land in Coffee and
Pink oft tnnnfina tKaf ftnlr fan anraa
to raise a bushel of wheat and it
wasn't much wheat at that.
I wrote once of the wonderful rise
in the world of a Chewalla boy, Hon-
ames L. Wilmeth, now Chief Clerk of
the United States Treasury Depart
ment at Washington, and am going
to say something about another one
of our boys that has the makings of a
mighty big man in him Al Lea, son
of Clem Lea, the noted farmer. But
just now my remarks will be directed
to the "noblest Roman of them all,''
General Marcus J. Wright, of the
War Department at Washington.
he General has now entered his
eighty-fifth year, but if you were to
go to his office in the granite palace
where the land defenses of the Unit
ed States are administered, adjoining
the White House, and tell him that
you were from McNairy county, he
would drop his most important work
and tell you to sit down and tell him
your name. Then, if you were a Mc-
Nairian "from way back" he would
tell you all about your relatives, and
treat you like a son.
There will not be room to tell the
military and literary history of Gen
eral Wright here. It has been, told
many times, in public documents
When he completed the stupendous
task of gathering the Confederate
records, begun in 1878, Hon. Eliho
Root, then Secretary of War, gave
him high commendation in a preface
to the printed work. This remains,
more durable than a monument of
stone, to be read by future genera
tions, and to add one more star- to
Tennessee as Mother of Great Men. '
General Wright cornea of military
stock. His grandfather, John Wright,
was a captain in the Revolutionary
War, born in Georgia. His father
was lieutenant-captain and major of
the Thirty-ninth U. S. Infantry, and
was promoted by Andrew Jackson for
bravery at the Battle of the Horse
shoe. . Marcus J. was lieutenant
colonel of the 154th Tennesseee Mili
tia when the war broke out in 1861;
was military governor of Columbus,
Ky., when he wa3 31 years old, and
was soon made brigadier-general, and
the list of his engagements and ser
vices would fill a volume itself. His
son John is captain of the regular
army.
Marcus J. Wright was born at
Purdy, June 5, 1831. His mother,
whose maiden name was Martha Ann
Hicks, was a noted beauty, and waa a
lifelong .friend of the old Mexican
War hero, Gen. Winfield Scott, they
having been born on adjoining planta
tions. Gen. Scott gave young Marcus
a dinner in honor of his mother at
Washington, when Marcus was eigh
teen years old. 1 first saw Gen
Wright on coming to Washington in
the summer of 1891: a man of some
what portly building, smooth-shave
except for a small beard on his lower
lip; a man of impressively intelligent
expression, both in looks and lan
guage, and yet, especially when talk
ing of his beloved native county, kin
dred and friends of his youth,' he was
just like a good old neighbor, with
enough of the polish of Washington
life and literary finish to make him
especially interesting. He never
seemed to be in a hurry, although
there were always many papers on his
desk awaiting his attention, and was
never too busy to talk about dear old
McNairy and its sweet memories for
him.
General Wright feels the weight
of years somewhat, and tpld the War
Department some months ago that he
wanted a rest; but they insisted that
he stay with them awhile longer. A
man of his ability and character is a
valuable asset in times like this, when
the adquate defense of our country is
such a live question, and they evidently
set great store by his wisdom
in experience in the great game of
national defense. Long may he re7
main, to reflect glory upon the land of
his birth, and to plan for its protec
tion. A man of less than half the age of
General" Wright; a ' slender, dark
skinned boy of about forty, knocked
at my office door here the other day.
I never had seen him before, but when
he said he was from McNairy, and was
a son of Clem Lea, you may be sure I
"sat up and took notice." This was
Al Lea, who was born over about
Gravelhill, where my dear mother
used to go to church when she was a
girl. Al used to ride horses at the
county fair races at old Purdy, but
he had higher horses in view, and
went to Shreveport, Louisiana. He
was United States marshal and post
master there, and went to Chicago
first in 1912 and then again this year,
as Louisiana delegate to the Republi
can National Convention. That's go
ing some, as they say here, for a
Gravelhill boy. But that is only tha
first chapter, so to speak, of a career
which will probably put Al Lea away
up in the Vanderbilt and Rockefeller
class before he gets through.
He 'came to see me in company
with a dapper looking financier from
Wall street, with whom he had been
conferring about getting capital to
work the new oil fields in Louisiana.
He represented nine independent oil
producers in that rich field. In fact,
there were three fields, Caddo, Red
River, and some other that I have for
gotten, that he had on bia string.
The Red River field, the richest of
them all, has brought in eighty-five
gushers, or spouting oil wells, and
millions are in sight, for the use of
all oil products, from the . crude pe
troleum to the gasoline, kerosene and
other refined articles, ia increasing
every day. He told about how some
old chap from McNairy tried to get
him to buy a piece of oil land near
Shreveporti If he had taken the man's
advice he would have made $75,000.
All the producers want ia capital to
work their territory and etart-a re
finery; and Wall street has enough
money to finance an empire; all it
wants is sufficient security for its
loans. The outlook seemed to be
favorable to Mr. Lea's cause while
here. But in the midst of worldly
cares he did not forget his religior,
and attended Sunday school in Brook
lyn. He hurried back home to take
up the business at that end, but
said he was coming again. He will
have indigestion for a couple of
weeks from the broiled lobster and
pate de foie gras that those money
jugglers treated him to while here,
and it will take a piece of good old
corn pone and a bowl of creamy clab
ber to get him all straightened out
again.
Mr. Lea did not have much to say
about the Convention at Chicago,
but remarked that the delegates
seemed to be in a more serious and
business-like mood than they were
four years ago. Jhey felt the re
sponsibility resting upon them to get
down to "brass tacks," do their work
well, and get home, and that is what
they did.
The chaos in Mexico has greatly
interfered with the oil business in
that troubled country, and that makes
it all the more probable that the
Louisiana fields will be developed to
the fullest extent. If our McNairy
friend has no bad lack, he will cer
tainly be heard from in both the
financial and political fields, and
goes without saying that he will re
flect added honor upon ' his family
name and npon his native soil.

Tells of the Curiosities of Forgiveness
Forgiveness is a c'yorious thing;
Sometimes it is the little sting,
The mocking word, though said in fun
That makes an enemy of one;
While him that done you deadly wrong
You'll make up with fore very long.
Jist listen:
I riled a widow woman once
By sayin her boy was a dunce;
That was back there in ninety-three.
Since then she hasnt spoke to me.
And that there man that shot her Jim
Why, tother day she married him
. That's what she done!
I said Bill Waffles was a gump,
And that old weasel took the stump
And worked agin me when I run
Fer sheriff and was beat by one.
I seed him ridin tother day
With the man that tricked his farm away
That's old Bill Waffles.
I tell ye now: be on yer guard; -When
you hit people, hit em hard;
Dont knock em easy if you do,
They shorely will git back at you.
Ruther than prod em with a pin,
My boy, you'd better not begin.
You hear me!

After Twenty Years of Service
It is now but four weeks until the
Congressional primary. It goes with
out saying that The Progress never
fails to find genuine pleasure in the
announcement that Mr. Sims offers for
re-election. We have not only been
an observer of local conditions but we
have keenly watched the expressed
sentiment throughout the Congres
sional District, and noted with satis
faction that the voter year after year
becomes less excited over the per
sonal ambitions of the candidates and
more concerned over the service to
be rendered and, with a growing ten
dency to "let well enough alone."
When Mr. Porter made bis announce
ment to make this second try-out
a? a congressional candidate, one
tried to make a survey of conditions
as to his availability, and, since we
must judge things by comparison, we
tried to figure, even giving him the
benefit of every doubt, in what way
he conld be considered a more for
midable candidate than Gen. Howard
two years ago. Gen. Howard was
quite the equal if not the superior in
tellectually; a much older man with a
broader experience; he was a public
official whose people had - re-elected
and kept in office for more than
twenty .years as Attorney General,
and no man, especially one of General
Howard's temperament, could so long
mix with a people without making
friends, and such friends as would
have and exercise a personal interest
in his political fortunes. Outside of
Henry county there are not 10 men of
political strength who would have a
personal interest in Mr. Porter on Mr.
Porter's account, for those who are
supporting him are not specially for
Porter but just opposed to Congress
man Sims. . Gen. Howard is a much
more"likeable" man personally, a bet
ter "mixer" as it is called. He had a
large personal acquaintance in eight
of the ten counties of the District,
knowing practically every voter in
seven of the counties where he held
court he knew intimately fifty times
the MfllCer of voters than does Por
ter; he had influential relatives in five
of the ten Counties of the district
which gave him a strength Porter
cannot command. He had an office
to surrender in event of his advance
ment to Congress and from a political
viewpoint this waa a valuable asset;
yet with all this advantage as we see
it in hia favor as against Mr. Porter's
availability, Gen. Howard could not
succeed against Mr. Sims, and there
was a reason the reason being that
the people felt that they had in Con
gressman Sims a man wholly equipped
for the place, who stands as high as
any man in the Congress of the Unit
ed States, and whose every effort and
attention has been to serve the peo
ple of this district. The one thing
that Porter can say that Gen. How
ard, was estopped from using is that
he has never held office and believes
in rotation of public officials. This is
an arguraenthowever, that appeals
only to the fewthe very few that
aspire to office,' simply as a place for
themselves in the government service.
The voter now appreciates that it
takes tenure jn a legislative body to
get rank and results, and the tenden
cy everywhere is to keep the faithful
representative just as long as he will
honestly serve thera. v During Mr.
Sims' longcareer be has never cast a
vote of which he is or was ashamed,
or for which it waa necessary for him
to apologize, nor has ' Mr. Porter
challenged a single vote or act of Mr.
Sims' twenty, years of activity, suffi
cient of itself to re-elect the Con
gressman.
Every vote he has cast has been in
keeping with principle; he does noth
ing for expediency or show; he has
none of the qualities of the profes
sional politician and shuns notoriety
and evades the press agent. He is
conferred with by President Wilson
in presenting the administration
measures and enjoys the esteem and
confidence of the President and Con
gressional leaders. ; ,
Our interest m Mr. Sims dates back
many years before he entered public
lire. He cannot boast tbat one grand
father was a Governor and the other
a, member of Congress as does his
opponent, but his grandfathers were
of the sturdy farmer class who earned
their living by the sweat of the bnw.
Mr. Sims had to make his own way in
everything he has undertaken in lrfe.
As a struggling young man he was
known to be so honorable and de
pendable that he had no difficulty in
getii ? Inds to loan him money to
go to school on and later as a strug
gling young lawyer repaid every ob
ligation. He ia conservative in act
and temperate in speech, and especial
ly now when the honor of the country
is being tried, do we need that con
servatism and balance of which he is
possessed. The District should be
congratulated that Mr. Sims offers for
re-election and our good fortune to
have such a man to be our- Repre
sentative. Lexiington Progress.
