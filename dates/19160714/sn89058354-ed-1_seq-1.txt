DORMITORY MOVEMENT
GAINS HEADWAY; MANY
LARGE CONTRIBUTIONS
Committee Is Meeting With
Much Success In Soliciting
Funds For Building
LIST OF CONTRIBUTIONS IS
GIVEN FOR PUBLICATION
Several Thousand Dollars Yet
To Be Raised Before Work
On Building Starts .
As the summer months wear
away and the date for the annual
opening of Grove High School
again approaches, interest in the
proposed dormitory for the boys
is rapidly increasing and the
members of the finance , commit
tee are ' making every effort to
secure all contributions necessary
as early as possible in order to
get the work on the building
under way as soon as is practic
able. AlrpnHv a crnnrt nnrtfrm nf the
amount needed, $17,000, has
been subscribed by the people of
Paris and Henry county, who
have shown a greater willingness
to give than was hardly expect-
d. However, there are a num-
?)er who have not been seen by
"flnembers of the committee, and
I who, for that reason, have not
subscribed.
While the members of the
committee are devoting as much
time as possible to the work, all
of them have other duties in con
nection with their business af
fairs and for this reason it will
probably be impossible for them
to see each and every person.
However, they have appealed to
the citizens of town and county
to come to their assistance and
make possible the early erection
of the needed dormitory.
W. C. Johnson is chairman of
the committee and those who
have not had an opportunity to
contribute to the dormitory fund
can call Mr. Johnson, or any
member of the committee, and
have their subscriptions entered.
The dormitory has been badly
needed for a number of years,
and it will mean much to the
Henry county boys who desire to
attend the high school, and live
too far out to go and come daily,
and all friends of the school are
glad that it is soon to be erected.
Following is a list of those
who have contributed to date,
and others will be announced
later:
G. L. Powers, $100: Jno. D.
Atkins, $100; Mrs. A. E. Rison,

STORE DAMAGED

basement about 2 o'clock' Wed
nesday morning, damaged the
stock and fixtures of of the Paris
Drug Company to the extent of

owned by J. J. Kemper. The
building is the property of Judge
A. B. Lamb. Mr. Kemper car
ried insurance to the amount of

West Wood street will be opened
under the management of Miss
Hope Coy, who was unanimously
chosen for the place by the board

-After Twenty
' Lexington, (Tenn.) '"Progrta"
It is now but four weeks until
the Congressional primary. It
goes without saying that The
Progress never fails to find genu
ine pleasure in the announcement
that Mr. Sims offers for re-election.
We have not only been an
observer of local conditions but
we have keenly watched the ex
pressed sentiment throughout
the Congressional District, and
noted with satisfaction that the
voter year after year becomes
less excited over the personal
ambitions of the candidates and
more concerned over the service
to be rendered and with a grow
ing tendency to "let well enough
alone."
When Mr. Porter made his an
nouncement to make this second
try-out as a congressional candi
date, one tried to' make a sur
vey of conditions as to his avail
ability, and since we must judge
things by comparison, we tried
to figure, even giving him the
benefit of every doubt, in what
way he could be considered as a
more formidable candidate than
was Gen. Howard two years ago.
Gen. Howard was quite the
equal if not the superior intel
lectually; a much older man with
a broader experience; he was a
public official whose people had
re-elected him and kept him in
office for more than twenty years
as Attorney-General, and no
man, especially one of Gen.
Howard's temperment, could so
long mix with a people without
making friends, and such friends
as would have and exercise a
personal interest in hi3 political
fortunes. Outside of Henry
county there are not 10 men of
political strength who have a
personal interest in Porter on
Porter's account, for those who
are supporting him are not speci
ally for Porter but just opposed
to Congressman Sims. Gen.
Howard is a much more "likea
ble," man personally, a better
"mixer" as it is called. He had
a large personal acquaintance in
eight of the ten counties of the
District, knowing practically ev
ery voter in seven of the coun
ties where he held court he
knew intimately fifty times the
number of voters than does Por
ter; he had influential relatives
in five of the ten counties of the
district which gave him a
strength Porter cannot command.
He had an office to surrender in
event of his advancement to

Years of Service
Congress and from a political
viewpoint this was a valuable as
set.; yet with all this advantage
as we see it in his favor as
against Mr. Porter's availability,
Gen. Howard could not succeed
against Mr. Sims, and there was
a reason the reasou being that
the people felt that they had in
Congressman Sims a man wholly
equipped for the place, who
stands as high as any man in the
Congress of the United States,
and whose every effort and at
tention has been to serve the
people of this district. The one
thing that Porter can say, that
Gen. Howard was estopped from
using is that he has never held
an office and believes in rotation
of public officials. This i3 an
argument however, that appeals
only to the few the very few
that aspire to office, simply as a
place for themselves in the gov
ernment service. The voter now
appreciates that it takes tenure
in a legislative body to get rank
and results, and the tendency
everywhere is to keep the faith
ful representative just as long a3
he will honestly serve them.
During Mr. Sims' long career he
has never cast a vote of which
he is or was ashamed, or for
which it was necessary for him
to apologize, nor has Mr. Porter
challenged a single vote or act
of Mr. Sims' twenty vears of
activity, sufficient of itself to re
elect the Congressman.
Every vote he has cast has
been in keeping with principle;
he does nothing for expediency
or for shpw; he has none of the
qualities of the professional poli
tician and shuns notoriety and
evades the press agent. He is
conferred with by President Wil
son in presenting the administra
tion measures and enjoys the es
teem and confidence of the
President and Congressional
leaders.
Our interest in Mr. Sims dates
back many years before he en
tered public life. He cannot
boast that one grandfather was
a Governor and the other a mem
ber of Congress as does his op
ponent, but his grandfathers
were of the sturdy farmer class
who earned their living by the
sweat of the brow. Mr. Sims
had to make his own way in ev
erything he has undertaken in
life. As a struggling young
man he was known to be so hon
orable end dependable that he

ENCAMPMENT OF
W.O.W. UNIFORM
RANK FOR PARIS
More than one thousand dele
gates and many visitors, making
a total of probably more than
2,000 people, will attend the
Uniform Rank Encampment of
the Woodmen of the World for
Tennessee and Kentucky, which
will be held at Paris early in
September.
At the court house Saturday
an enthusiastic mass meeting of
citizens pledged themselves to
assist in every way in accomo
dating the visitors, who will
spend a week in Paris, and a
committee on arrangements, and
another on finances, was ap
pointed. J. M. Freman was elected
chairman of the mass meeting
and A. W. Jackson secretary.
The committee on arrangements
is composed of M. W. Younkin,
J. L. Holland, C. A. Love, E. B.
McGehee and J. T. Porter. The
finance committee is composed of
W. T. Young, J. L. Clendenin
and W. E. Sparks. A. G. Math
ews, of Memphis, attended the
meeting.
Those attending the encamp
ment will probably spend thous
ands of dollars in Paris, and it
was only through the hard work
of E. C. Brizendine, district
manager, and other officers that
this city secured the W. O. W.
encampment, as Nashville and a
number of Kentucky cities were
contenders for it.
At a meeting of Maple Camp
W. O. W. Tuesday night a com
mittee composed of H. E. Kibbons
R. S. SottandZ. W. Vaughn was
appointed to assist.
Anothar important meeting of the
camp will be held Tuesday night
July 25.
On Thursday of the week that
the encampment will be held here
which will be sarly in Septmber,
there will be a big parade and de
monstration, followed by the
class introduction of several
hundred candidates.
had no difficulty in getting
friends to lend him money to go
to school and later as a strug
gling young lawyer repaid every
obligation. He is conservative
in act and temperate, in speech,
and especially . now when the
honor of $he country is being
tried, do We need that conserva
tism and balance of which he is
possessed. The District should
be congratulated that Mr. Sims
offers for reelection, and our
good fortune to have such a
man to be our Representative.
