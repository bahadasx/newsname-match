tain After Visit.
AMBASSADOR PLEASED
WITH CRAFT SUCCESS
Six Seamen on Merchant
men Are Entertained at
the White House.
BALTIMORE. July 13. Count von
lienistorff, the German ambassa
dor, spent an hour aboard the German
submarine merchantman Deutschland
today. He Inspected the vessel from
stem to stern, had the Intricate ma
chinery and instruments aboard ex
plained to him and personally con
gratulated Captain Koenig upon
bringing his vessel safely to America
through waters infested with hostile
war craft.
Two attaches of the German em
bassy, the German and Austrian
consuls in Baltimore and Major Pres
ton uccouipanied the ambassador on
his visit to the submarine. The intense
heat inside the hull of the vessel gen
erated by tho sun rays beating upon
the deck and sides prevented the party
Irom remaining aboard longer than
an hour.
Official l'iiM-is.
The ambassador informed Captain
Koenig that he would send to him
before the Deutschland starts on her
return voyabe several packages of of
ficial papers which he desires to have
delivered intact to the Berlin foreign
office. Some of these documents
embassy officials have been reluctant,
to trust In the regular mails because
it was considered likely they would
fall into the hands of British censors.
The ambassador was enthusiastic as
he emerged from the conning tower of
the Deutschland.
"it is a wonderful boat and with as
courugeous a crew as ever sailed the
sea, has made u wonderful voyage,'
sulci he. "I looked Into every com
partment and hud my first experience
wnn a periscope.
"Captain Koenig did not tell me J urn
vvnon he expects to leave for Ger
many, but I presume It will be soon
after he has his return cargo aboard.
He is In complete charge of the ves
sel ard his orders come from Berlin.
His craft is a private one just as
much us any North German-Lloyd
liner. Sly visit was entirely unofficial."
1 ill liquet for Captain.
The ambassador, prior to visiting
the submarine, attended a luncheon at
the Germanla club, given In honor of
Captain Koenig. Tonight he wa
present at a dinner given by Mayoi
Preston to the commander of the sub
marine. Citv officials who visited the sub
marine today quoted Captain Koenib
as saying that Zeppelin ulrshu
freighters arc being built in Germany
for trans-Atlantic service.
"To you," Captain Koenig was
quoted as saying, "tho trip of the
Deutschland is a great achievement.
You must not be too enthusiastic over
it because a bigger surprise Is com.
ing. A German Zeppelin airship, .
maybe I should say airships, are be
ing built in Germany. In the not dis
tant future one or more of them will
sail through the air to the United
States. Just as sure as the Deutsch
land come to America so will the Zep
pelins come."

WASHINGTON, July 13. Six sea
men from tho German submarine
merchantman Deutschland came over
from Baltimore today and were enter,
tained at the White House and the
navy department. A White House at
tache showed them through the east,
blue and red rooms, the cabinet room
and President Wilson's private office.
One of the youngsters asked per.
miwlnti to sit in the president's chair
at the head of the cabinet table ana
he did it while his comrades grinned.
All were much interested in the wa
maps showing the positions of the
armies In Europe and they pointed
with pride to the names of their homo
towns in Germany.
At the navy department Assistant
Secretary Roosevelt reeelvtd the visi
tors and congratulated them In Ger

NEW YORK, July 13. That In
fantile paralysis Is neither so
uncertain in origin or in fatal or
permanent in effect as generally sup
posed, was the assertion made by Dr.
Simon Flexner of the Rockefeller In
stitute In a paper read at a mass
meeting' of physicians hero tonight
While tho death rate h:H vanated
from 5 to 20 per cent, this figure is
not accurate, as only a small number
of cases are actually renorted, Dr.
Flexm-r said. Many of those serious
ly affected eventually make complete
recovery.
The origin of tho disease is In tht
secretions of the nose, throat and In
testines. The chief conveyor is the
human being himself, Doctor Flexner
said, whether consciously afflicted or
not. I'lics are known to have carried
the Infection In some cases and poul
try, pigs, dogs and cats are suspi-cted.
The chief means of dissemination are
kissing and sneezing and coughing
which throw the virus into the atmos
phere whence it Is carried direct to
the mucous membranes of the nose
and throat and thence to the spinal
cord and brain.

Very many cases also have beet,

THF, most violent fighting in the
great entente allied offensive Is
on the eastern front where General
Brussilolf's tremendous blows arc
being continued without apparent lull
or hesitation. Temporarily at least
tho Austro-Germans appear to have
halted the Itussian advance along the
Stokhod. Both sides are reported to
bo hurling huge reinforcements of
men and guns into this titanic strug
gle, tho prize of which is tho Im
mensely Important strategic town of
Kovel.
Further south a battle of almost
equal Intensity is raging on the lower
St ii pa where the Russians are strik
ing north In an effort to crush General
von But Inner and flank the entire
Aust ro-( ierman line.
The Aiistnans admit that the Rus
sians have penetrated General von
Hot timer's front at somo points, but
assert they wero driven out again in
counter-ai tacks. The Russians claim
to have taken two thousand prisoners
but make no mention of u gain ill
territory.
British Hold Gains.
The British have held their gains
on their portion of the Homme front
and the usual period of consolidation
and the pushing forward of Die big
artillery Is presumed to be taking
place. A similar situation exists on
the French line and a remarkably
brief French official statement of
Thursday night simply records he con
tinuance of the bombardment of Fort
Souville in the Verdun region.
Two Important statements In regard
to the situation on the western front
were made In loniloii on Thursday.
Premier Asquith, speaking in tho
house of lords, dec lined that tho
British supply of munitions was ampin
and that the Franco-British offensivu
was merely at its beginning. The sec
ond statement was made by .Minister
of War Lloyd-George, addressing an
allied conference on equipment. The
minister of war declared that the
British output of ammunition will soon
no overwhelming and that tho new
factories und workshops have not yet
attained one-third their full capacity.
He asserted that fhe tide of victory
now Is flowing in the direction of tho
entente allies and predicted tiiat It
would continue to do so.
