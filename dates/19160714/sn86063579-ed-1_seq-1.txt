Fine Display ef Ores at tha Chamb

Much Faverable Attantidn
Deming is experiencing a consid
erable mining activity from develop
ments and ore shipment from the
tributary east, south and north, in
the Victorio, the Tree Hormanas, and
Florida and Cooks Peak mining dis
trict. A bureau of mined has been
orgnixed by the Icding mine owners,
osrtors nd prominent local business
men to promote legitimate mining and
gve publicity to the mineral re
sources of Luiih county. The Tre
Hermaua mining district is being
mined almost entirely by Deming
people and those interested with them
and i now in a productive stage.
The Tre HermaniiH district is 23
mile south of Deming, in the Tree
Hermann mountains, and is reach
ed over a good wagon road.
In the Tres Hermann district
there are four or live outtlls or com
panies operating, vie: The Axure
Mining company, The Ho)te Group,
the Old Homestead, the big Four,
and the Mack associates..
The Axure Mining company haa a
bond and lease on the Colebra group
of claims, owned by Dr. S. D. Swope
of Deming and is actively working,
developing and exploring the same.
The property comprises nine claim.
The Axure company ia composed o f
N'ew York people and haa also other
important copper interests in the
Burro mnuntaius in Grant county.
W. R. Wade, the well known mining
engineer is the general manager of
the company.
