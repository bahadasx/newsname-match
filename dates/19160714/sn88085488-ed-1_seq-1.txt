College Wfedneedny
Washington Slate College was the
Mecca for young fanners Wednes
day when 150 enthusiastic boys and
girls representing the Whitman
county boys' and girls' clubs spent
an interesting and instructive day
watching expert demonstrators cook
andean products of the farm and lis
tening to lecturers explain in prac
tical terms how to look after pigs, l
poultry, rabbits and garden patches.
Quite a number of the visitors
came in automobiles from nearby
towns. Colfax, Rosalia and Palouse
had conspicuous delegations, and
from Albion and Elberton there were
several parties. Many of the boys
and girls were accompanied by their
parents, who were equally interested
in the program of the day. Promptly
at 10:00 o'clock the excursionists
met in the old chapel, where they
were welcomed by T. .1. Newblll,
state leader of boys' and girls' clubs,
who explained the functions of club
work. Dr. A..A. Cleveland, principal
of the summer session, also spoke
on behalf of organized interests
among rural communities. Mrs.
Elizabeth Jones, assistant state lead- 1
er, gave a practical demonstration i
of cooking and canning, which was
followed with much interest. Mrs. I
Jones showed how efficiency and !
economy could be obtained in the
preserving of fruits and vegetables.
The correct packing of the jar, the
proper proportion of fruit and Juice,
and the final sealing were points;
that received emphasis.
Immediately after the meeting the |
party adjourned to the lawn in front !
of Bryan hall, where a picnic lunch I
was served by the home economics
department. Representatives of the j
Pullman Chamber of Commerce met!
and mingled with the youthful but
enthusiastic visitors. When the as-i
sembled group had posed for the of- 1
ficial photographer they set out for'
a busy afternoon of demonstrations 1
and Instruction. The boys and girls ;
were segregated according to (dubs.
Those interested in poultry were 1
taken care of by Mrs. Whitaker,
m*& of the poultry department, who;
conducted the visitors over the ex
tensive plant, where an opportunity 1
.to see model poultry buildings and j
Incubators was given. The garden I
clubs, under Prof. O. M. Morris I
head of the department of horticul
ture, were shown over the green-,
nouses and truck patches. Under!
•Mrs, Jones, a group of girls Inter- \

Roy Kdgeconib, who had been swini-i
ming, lost his stroke and sank, call
ing for help when he came to the
surface. Mrs. Porter was standing
on the hank and at once plunged Into
the water at the deepest place. She
failed to touch bottom and sank, call- j
ing upon her son, Harry, to save the
Edgecomb boy, whom she had failed
to reach. The youth plunged after his I
mother, who had sunk the second
time, and succeeded in pushing her
to the bank and to safety, then turn
ing bis attention to the Edgecomb
boy. lames, Jr., a brother of the i
boy, In the meantime had succeeded
in gel ting hold of his brother and
held him until Harry Porter came to;
his assistance, the two succeeding In j
pulling him to safety,
But for the presence of mind and l
bravery of the Porter boy, both his
mother and the lOdgecomb youth
would probably have been drowned,
as the water, due to the washout by
the high water of the early spring,!
was much deeper than expected. Tin
depth of the pool was measured after!
the accident and found to be 57
inches, or deep enough to drown
anybody who can not swim. Mrs, j
Porter considers the outcome a (
fortunate one indeed, and desires to
sound a warning against swimming
or wading In the water at that point,
as the depth is very deceiving.

PULLMAN. WASHINGTON, FRIDAY. JULY 14. 1916
PULLMAN IN LINE FOR BIG
KNIFE MANUFACTURING PLANT
'Harnett's Incorporated" Selects Pullman as
Location for Factory for Manufacture of
Patented Kitchen Knives
The location of a huge manufac
turing plant in Pullman, employing
at the star; .6 men. and placing
Pullman on th* manufacturing map
to stay si c< mingent upon the recep
tion tender the movement by Pull
ii an citizens, and unless all signs
tail the plant will be an assured
Hung within a few week., at most.
'I In article o he manufactured is
R kitchen knife with detachable am!
interchangeable blades, patterned
after the t.illett razor blade system,
hut with man. Improvements. A
patent on the contrivance was se
cured by Arthur It. Burnett, a son
ih-lnw of ('. Ft. Maynard of near Col
lon, and was assigned to "1 arnottV,
Incorporated," an association organ
ized in Seattle with capital stock
placed at $200,000. Tic patent will
be protected by Uncle Sam for IT
ears, and ;be possibilities of he en
terprise are considered lo be unlim
ited by conservative business men
who have made a close study of the
nt Ire proposition.

mlttee. The report, which as high-
I) favorable, was as follows:
"We, ihe undersigned having
thoroughly investigated I he merits of
he " Mane 'i. I lie), pointed." a
Washington corporation organized
for the pin use of mamifacturlni?
new and protected knives, said pat
ent being owned by said company
I contemplating a factory for said
manufactory in Pullman, we hereby
recommend the same as being feas
ible and under proper management
should be a good invest nt and an
enterprise I enelicial to Pullman and
vicinity."
The plans of the promoters are to
sell sufficient stock In and near P.ill
man to erect a |5000 factory,
equipped with machinery and stock
to the value of approximated 110,
--000, Mr. Harnett already has orders
for nearly 30,000 of the knives and
several wholesalers have asked to be
trade distributors for their particular
district, A lit 100 feet square will
be required for the site, an I this will
be selected, as near the business dis
trict as possible, as soon as the pre-,
liminary arrangements can be com
pleted,
The factory will be made tone
story at the start, with the founda
tion and walls of sufficient strength
to accommodate additional stories as j
the growth of the plant demands,
The [factory will begin operations
: with a force of 26 men, which will
| mean an output of 300 of the knives,
I and blade sets each eight-hour day.
As soon as feasible additional shifts
lof men will be put on. the ultimate
j aim being for two full shifts, with
a hall shift for the early evening.
j The half shift would provide work
; for ii large number of college boys
: who are working their wav through
school, and these men would be
given the preference.
The labor in connection with the
manufacture of the knives will con
stitute the principal cost, the ma
terial cost being a small considera
tion in comparison. it is estimated
that the difference In manufacturing
the knives in Pullman and some east
crn point would be not more than
one cent each, due to the light
: weight or the material to be shipped
in. The steel used in the construc
tion of the knives comes from the
manufacturers cut to size and ready
to work. It is a special steel, made
to order, and will be highly tempered
i at the local factory.
The patent Is past the experi
mental stage. $10,000 having been
'already expended in experimentation,
until the knives are as near. perfec-
I tion as they can be made. Two thou

prise came suddenly and unexpect

his wife i.nd child, avis visiting ■•!
the home of his father-in-law for a,
few days prior to going to New York
city to i-:a''o final arrangements for
the local of a plant. Ills plans
came tot attention of May or lack
son, who .it once :;i« Pullman's op
I
portunity i.nd stilted an active cam-
I aign to si" re I lie location ol I lie
plant. A i i;iv in Mr. Darnel '« de- '
parture was secured and the plan j
was unfold -1 to a number of con
servative and Influential citizens,
withe result hat til 3 entire mat
ter was placed before the chamber
of commerce at Its Tuesday luncheon
The chamber unanimously en
dorsed the enterprise, contingent
upon the report following, the investi
gation of the new Industries com-
Model of knife to be

man, showing case of
six blades underneath
sand sets, made as a trial output,
have already been sold, and have
given great satisfaction, with the re
sult thai the demand for the knives
has already been created, and but
little remains to be done aside from
manufacturing them in large quanti
ties and placing them on the market.
Persons who have made a (lose
study of the enterprise are highly
enthusiastic, and see not only a valu
able addition to Pullman's commer
cial activities, but substantial and
increasing profits to Pullman stock
holders. Shares will be sold at $10
each until sufficient money is on
hand to start the enterprise. The
corporation is capitalized at $200.
--000. The management of the con
tern, to be selected by the stock
holders, through th ; directors, will
maintain head offices in Pullman
and this city will b" made the dis
tributing point.
The knife is a novelty in the cut
lery field, and nothing of its nature
lias ever before been manufactured.
Six blades go with each knife, and
as soon as one is dulled it can be re
moved and another substituted The
knives will be made in several dif
ferent shapes, to suit the use to
which they are to be put. The blade,
which is thin and almost razor edged,
fits into a groove in the knife proper,
and is easily interchanged. A get of
the blades will retail at 50c, so that
there will be no necessity of the
housewife or carver using a dull
knife.
Models of the knives have been
submitted by Mr, Harnett to large
manufacturing and cutlery house
and in each case the inventor has
been highly complimented upon his
practical and useful patent
Boosters of the enterprise, and
there are many of them, call atten
tion to the phenomenal record of the
Gllletl Safety Razor company, a con
em whose patent, from the .stand
point of universal use, Is almost on
a parallel With the interchangeable
bladed knife. The Glllett company
started only a few years ago with a
capitalization of $650,000. After
paying substantial and increasing
dividends to the stockholders, the
company now has a surplus of close
to $3,000,000, and the capitalization
has never been Increased, although
many moneyed men have made fu
tile efforts to secure additional stock
In the concern.
