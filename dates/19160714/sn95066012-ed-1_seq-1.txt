SHARK HUNTERS IN
SEARCH FOPJIG
Concerted Effort All Along the New
Jersey Shore
BOY'S BODY IS RECOVERED
All Bathing Has Been Stopped Except
at Places Where Wire Nets Are
Stretched.
New York, July 14: Mate wan Crock
the little stream in which two swim
mers were killed by u shark and anoth
er severely bitten on Wednesday, was
alive with sharks yesterday, according
to the scores of men who went out to
hunt them with riffles, shotguns, boat
hooks, harpoons, pikes, and rynaniite.
Many tired from the banks or from
motor boats at what they thought were
sharks. Dozens were sure they had
seen one shark or more. There was
well corroborated testimony indicating
that there were at least four in the
si ream w ithin two miles of where it
enters Haritan Hay. A net of chicken
wire has been strung across just above
Wyeoff's Dock at Matawan, where
Stanley Fisher and Lester Stllwell
were killed on Wednesday, and a stout
lish net has been placed at a trolley
bridge a mile below to hold the sharks
in the creek until they be shot or har
pooned. Several sharks were caught by fish
ers along the New Jersey and Long
Island coasts yesterday and cut up, but
no evidence was found that any of
them had attacked bathers, four of
whom have been killed and a fifth
maimed by sharks within two weeks.
Bathing has come almost to a stop
along the Jersey coast, especially near
lK)ints wher the man-eaters have made
uttacks and a new sport. combined
with a public service, the hunting of
sharks, has sprung up.
Although a shark was reported in
Sheopshead Hay yesterday, and others
wero caught off Long Island, bathing
went on as usual at Coney Island,
Brighton Beach, Long Beach, and oth
er island resorts.

New York, July 13. Leaders In the
medical profession, public health ex
perts from many cities, philanthrop
ists and charity workers thronged the
rooms of the Academy of Medicine
here tonight to attend the mass meet
ing for the discussion of infantile
paralysis, Those who hoped that a

or that isolation of its deadly germ
would be announced, were disappoint
ed. Ur. Simon Flexner of the Rocke
feller institute for medical research
and Other experts, told of the progress
made by medical science in combat
ting tile disease, hut they had no
epoch making discoveries to proclaim.
Dr, Flexner, who has devoted his
own skill and the resources of the
Rockefeller institute to the battle
igainst the disease, declared. how-
ver, that there is no occasion lor
panic. Me asserted that the death
rate from infantile paralysis is lower
even than from other maladies con
sldered far less serious. He had a
message of cheer tor anxious parents
in the announcement that a large per
centage of cases there are complete
recoveries.
Dr. Henry Koplik. who spoke on
he "Clinical Types of the Diseaset,"
declared everything known to modern
science is being done in this city to
stay the epidemic.
rtifical respiration was suggest
ed by Ur. Louis C. Ager as one method
of treatment. He said it was possible
considerable might be accomplished
in that way.
Br. Haven Fmerson, health com
missioner of this city, told what is be
ing done to light the epidemic and
isserted the widespread alarm which
parents feel is not justified. He point
ed out that out of 1'600 suspected cases
investigated only true cases of
infantile paralysis had been found of
which 3us resulted latally.
that Infantile paralysis is neither
so uncertain m 0111:111 nor so lata or
leriiiaiient in effect as generally sup
posed, was the assertion made bv Dr.

varied from ." to 20 per cent this

'rotectlon can best be gained
through the Isolation of the disease
even in the earliest stages, and the
sanitary control of those coining in

no safe method of preventive Inocula

made with the transtUSlOU of blood

NEW YORK TROOP
PISE WORRIED BY
CANDIDACY OF
GOV. GATES
Strength for Governor Shown at
Big Gathering
HE IS NOT YET IN THE FIELD
Meeting at Montpelier indicated That
Governor Fully Maintains His
Popularity. y
One of the rather unexpected de
velopments of the Creater Vermont as
sociation at Montpelier this week was
that Covet nor Gates is leading In tho
senatorial race if the sentiment of tho
thousand or so delegates present Is a
correct guide.
Governor Gates has not yet an
nounced his candidacy for the senate,
but those who were at Montpelier got
the impression that lie. will be in tho
race and the man against whom Pago
and Fletcher will have to make their
light rather than against each other.
It seems that Senate- Page has al
ready sensed this new situation and is
prompt to act. The following Mont-
pi Her dispatch to the Rutland Her
ald shows the drift.
Montpelier, July 13. The latest pro
duct of Senator Page's letter-writing
hint is directed at Gov. Gates and bis
candidacy for the senatorship. It is a
form letter multigraphed and signed
by a fac-simlle, printed from a cut.
and does not show the senator's usual
careful attention to details.
Instead of the warm, personal let-
'1 r. each separately typewritten and
signed personally, addressed and sun-
titled, "My Dear John or Jones or
Smith,'' the letter is of the "My Dear
Sir" type and indicates that the sen
