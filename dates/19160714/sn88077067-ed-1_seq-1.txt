SteaUea.sie.s Grow in Cities
Corroborative of statements heretofore
made in these column,? about the laxity
of law enforcement under the present
state administration, is a news story in
the Cleveland l'lain Jtealer. Following
the storied deal which made Willis Kv-
ernor it was said that certain classes
would be permitted to do pretty much us
they liked. They have. That Is what
brounht out the opposition candidate to
(lovernor Willis in his own party. It is
what Is nnikinu: the decent, law-abldint;
people writhe. Jt is what is causing both
political advisers of the governor now t&
insist that he make some kind of a play
at law enforcement that will win buck u
portion of those who now hold aloof from
him. Here is what the l'lain Dealer says:
'Iteports are reachim.' Columbus from

have been formed by the hundred in
the cities and are making things easy
for men who want drinks during the
proscribed time. So llagrant has been
the disregard of tho law become In
places that formal protests have been
tiled by the dry leaders and ollicials
and strong efforts have been made to
make license restrictions again effect
ive. "Saloons are In dperatlon under the
direction of men who were originally
denied licenses. Some of these places
cater to women and are known as dis
reputable resorts. One such place In
Columbus Is not remote from the
Stale House. It is one of the show
places of the capital city's night life.
"I'olice authorities in most of the ,
cities are less watchful of most of the
resorts. Since the enactment of tlie
license law It Is left largely In the
hands of the state liiiuor licensing
commission and the local licensing'
authorities. Just now two of the Held
Inspectors of the state board are un
dergoing investigal ion of alleged pad

lieu rd some talk that a special grand

some of the phases of law enforce

Section U'dOl of the Ohio Automohile
Laws , a.s; "Any perso 1 operalinw a inot
orcy !. or mot or veh.de at a ti eater
speed than S miles per hour in the busi

more than miles outside of any munic
ipality wliie'i means the public road, shall

Section l..'ti'i."i puis the same lines on any
motor vehicle driver who does not slow
dow n or slop upon behiK .stKualled and
does not stop Ioiir enough so the horse
dramw vehicle or horse can pass.
Section 12Wi puts same tine on any
motor vehicle driver who does not stop
in case of accident and does not ive his,
address on request or if not owner the i
owner's address.
Section liil I regulates, the lf-ht and
prescribe h tnat I rout lights shall ilhim
inate 2'Mi feet ahead and rear white li4bt
is to illuminate the rear license so that
it can la- read and the Ohio Trallic Rules
and KegHlat ions under this law provide
that no headlight shall be wlarinw uny
approaching driver of automobile or horse
drawn Vehicle at a distance ol" 200 feet at
levation of live feet that means when
the driver's eyes are live feet above tin
roadway.
Mow many lights one meets that will
not permit tlie approaching driver to see
nythintf toward the approaching car, at
t distance of n miurtor of a mile or a
huh" mile. Stop that! The law is plain!
Why cannot we have sane, conservative
Irivimr accordinu lo law on our public
roads. Why not pull such fellows that
oflenders ol public safety and put
them subject to our laws, even if tney
prominent business men or of a stand
ing' Im-: her up. that is no excuse lor
breaking the law or putting someone low-
r down in peril or danger. Hefore God
nd the liw there should lie no distinc
tion. The poor man's life is as valuable
anyone elses and the slate should pro
t him as much ns anybody else. The
tis ire not built exclusively for the unto
but for everybody and our otllcers of the
hould properly enforce those laws
that are necessary for public mm let v to
limb and life nnd property, I have an
iuto myself and run it, too, but so that
my tellow occupants and the users of the
pul lie road is safe. Excessive speemng
OKI excessive lighting should nnd must be
punished by law if we want public safety
m ttie public roads and the sooner such
is done the better it will be for the gen-.'t'.-il
use ol the automobile. Citizens, get
up on-.l have the law enforced and when
election comes know that the man you
vote for will stad and tlLht lor miblie
safety nnd will enforce the public safety
laws. The prosecuting attorney is em
powered und. r Section 2!li to inquire in
to the commission of crimes in the coun
ty and now cur duty as citizens is to see
that same is done. Uou't Kive your vote
to anyone unless ou knew mat he will
li4'ht nnd stand for public safety. The care-.
less driver the speed era ze the exces
sive light are the enemies of the public
safety on public roads and we must stand
shoulder to shoulder to eradicate them.

Victim of Haying; Season
Frank Katns, aged about 45, living on
the line between Dublin and Blackcreek
townships, was the victim of an accident
Sal unlay uhosu outcome is yet a mat
ter of ijueslion. He was engaged in hay
ing when the hay fork fell from tlie car
rier, one prong of which passed entirely
through his hip. Owing to the nature of
tiie injury, no assurance of the result can
be given at this time. Willahlre Her
11 Id,
Henry Kolpftiosh, the fifteen year old
son of Air. and Airs. August Kolpfiiesh, of
Liberty township, suffered a fracture of
the left leg last Thursday evening-. He
was playing with a crowd of boys and
in jumping a fence slipped and fell.
William ll. Weaver, living northeast of
town, suffered a fracture of the right
arm last Friday afternoon. He was work
ing in the liny mow of his barn wnen the
floor gave way and he fell to the ground.
