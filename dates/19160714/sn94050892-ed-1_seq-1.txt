SCHOOL BONDS ARE
REFUSED BY
BIDDERS
$25,000 Voted for Improvements in
School District Number 3 is Not
Available, Owing to Irregularity in
Advertising for Bids.
The school bond iss"ue which was
voted on at a special school election
held In April has fallen through for
the time being on account of the
advertisement for bids not having
.been made out in the right form.
OThe bonds, in the sum of $25,000
were bought by Sweet, Causey, Fos
ter Co., of Denver. Upon investiga
ting the legality of the transaction it
was found by these people that the
advertisement calling for bids was
1 not proF?rly drawn up, and after
carefully looking into the matter they
decided to withdraw their bid and at
a recent meeting of the Board of Su
pervisors the certified check for $2500
was returned to the Denver firm.
It appears that from a revision of
the state laws recently when bids of
this kind are advertised the different
purposes for which the money is to
be used must be specified in the call
and not lumped together. The items
must be segregated and approximate
estimates made of the different ex
penditures. In the case of the
school bonds the bids were advertis
ed collectively for the amount of
$25,000, and on this account accord
ing to legal authority the call is void
and the Denver firm decided to run
'no chances.
The improvements outlined for
the Clifton district were extensive
and the inability to proceed with the
work at this time is a disappoint
. ment as it was calculated by the
trustees to commence the needed im
provements as soon as possible so
i that the students might have the
v3 benefit of them during the coming
year. The attitude of the trustees is
not known in regard to ' the matter
and whether the bids will be re-advertised
to conform to the law has not
been decided. From all indications
unless this is done the bond .issue will
be a dead factor and the changes and
conditions so badly needed in the
Clifton district will not be made.
PRISON PETS HAVE
FIRST GALL ON
CLIMATE
PHOENIX, July 8. Citizens of. the
southwestern part of Arizona are on
the warpath. This has nothing to do
with the Mexican situation, but it
Is none the less exciting to the peo
ple of Palomas, Agua Caliente and
vicinity, for they are houses-bound be
cause of tins heat.
It always gets hot in summer in
that section of the state, but , it is
the Arizona heat that nobody really
minds. But the heat is too much
for the vacation group of conviats
of the state penitentiary, who were
sent down to build the road on the
border route which was to connect
Phoenix with southern California.
Governor Hunt's pet convicts were
, sent down there some time ago from
Florence to build this road. When
the heat became somewhat severe
(for the convicts but not for the
residents), the convicts complained
and .their complaint, it is said, very
' quickly reached the ear of the ten
der hearted executive. Accordingly
after studying the weather map a bit,
Governor Hunt ordered the convicts
removed to the cooler regions of Ya
vapai couny, where they will be en
abled to spend the warm summer
months in cool comfort.
'But the people of Palomas are
wild,' said one of them who man
aged to make his way to Phoenix
today. "The governors' pets have
left the road well-nigh impassible.
For twelve miles or so near Palomas
it is in about as bad condition as it
could be. It may be too hot for the
governor's prison bird pets, but we
folks have to live down there and it
doesn't get too hot for us. It's a
blankety-blank outrage on the people
of the entire state and we'll let Hunt
know it on election day."
One man who made the trip re
cently reports that K took him an
hour and a half to cover a distance of
eight miles. The highway was left
all broken up, making passage nearly
impossible.
Ladies Visit Metcalf
A large number of the members of
the Woman's Democratic League went
to Metcalf last Saturday for the pur
pose of organizing a similar club at
Vhat place. The ladies report that
they met with excellent success and a
club was organized at that place with
a good membership. The Clifton wo
men were so well treated by their
neighbors on this occasion that many
o them have accepted an invitation
to meet with the Metcalf ladies on
next Wednesday when they will have
their first meeting. Also members of
the local league are planning on going
to Morenci in the near future and or
ganizing a club at that place.
MISS DORIS DRAIN
Soon after Easter Miss Doris Drain
of Washington is to be married to Ed

MENINGITIS REAPPEARS .
AT BISBEE THIS WEEK
.
BISBEE, July 13. Another case
of spinal meningitis appeared in
the city of Bisbee yesterday in
the taking down of Alonzo Gar
dia, eleven year old step-son of
former Mexican Consul J. L.
Perez. The boy was taken ill
yesterday morning, and was re
ported in critical condition by
two local physicians last night.
While this is- the second case to
appear in the district since the
epidemic two months ago, no
fears -are felt by the local health
authorities but that the cases
can be kept isolated.
BIG DIESEL ENGINE
BLOWN TO
PIECES
Four Hundred and Fifty Horse
Power Engine at Big Mining
Plant Collapses.
LORDSBURG, July 14. On Thurs
day morning of the 6th, the 450
horse power Diesel crude oil burn
ing engine suddenly rose in the air
and scattered itself over the mountain
side on. which is situated the site of
the 85 Mining Company. Luckily,
there was no one very near the
power house at the time, no one was
injured.
The 85 company is one of the larg
est producers in Grant county. The
workings are two miles from the
town of Lordsburg. A. J. Inderrie-
dei is general manager and J. W.
Jackson is superintendent. The
company has recently been shipping
750C tons of ore to the Calumet &
Arizona smelter at Douglas per month
A much larger amount could be
easily shipped except for the inabili
ty of the smelters to handle the ore.
The bulk of the ore is copper sul
phide and carries 72 per cent silica.
A depth of about 500 feet has been
reached and the workings including
the tunnels total many thousand
feet.
Another new engine is on the way
and may arrive any day. Until jtf
comes, the operators will have thei!
hands full. Trouble with the engina
st;.ited some time ago, and although
there was some talk of danger, no
one expected that there would be an
explosion.
Slight Auto Accident
Thursday afternoon as C. W. Doe
proprietor of the Princess Confec
tionery, was making ice cream deli
veries in his Ford delivery car, two
young men riding in the back of the
machine were thrown out and badly
bruised. Don Brutinel and James
Burtch were sitting in the back of the
car on the ice cream buckets when
in turning a sharp corner the car
skidded, throwing Jhem to the ground.
Don was thrown for some distance
and his face was badly bruised and
lacerated, while James received but
comparatively few injuries. Al
though considerably shaken up both
boys are around not much the worse
for their experience. Mr. Doe re
mained in the car, his hold on the
steering wheel saving him from be
ing thrown out. This was a narrow
escape for the boys and they are for
tunate that a serious accident was
averted .
COUNT
BIG
Th second count in the Clifton
Merchants' and Copper Era big piano
contest came to a close yesterday af
ternoon and the number of votes
gained by the contestants over the
previous count was gratifying. Mrs.
Luke Culver was again the winner
of the $10 in gold, although her margin
was small, she leading with a total
of 42,200.
Miss Jewell Burgess won the sec
ond prize of $5.00 with 36,100 votes.
All the young ladies made appreci
able gains over their standing in the
first count and the interest manifest
ed by them in the past week shows
that each one is out for the big prize.
The standing of the contestants in
the first count was as follows:
Mrs. Luke Culver 26,625
Florence O'Leary 18,575
Jewell Burgess 13,850
'Lucie Tellez 1,850
Ethel Brooks 1,500
'Eileen Thompson 1,000
1 The count Thursrday shows the fol
lowing gains:
iMi-s. Luke Culver 42.200
Jewell Burgess 36,100
Florence O'Leary .... .. 29,600
Ellen Thompson 3,150
The total votes received by each
candidate up to date is as follows:
Mrs. Luke Culver 67,825
Jewell Burgess 49,800
Florence O'Leary 48,175
Ellen Thompson 3,150
Lucie Tellez .' 1,850
Ethel Brooks 1,500
A comparison of the total votes in
the last count shows that the lead
of the winner is comparitively small,
and that her closest opponents with
a little more diligent work will
give her a hard run for the first
prize in the final count on July 31st.
Each young lady in the contest has
been working energetically to win
the grand prize, the Obermeyer &
Sons $400 piano which will be given
away on the above date to the one
having the most votes to her credit.
It is no time now for any of the con
testants to lay down as the big prize
is worth working for, besides the
prizes to be given by the merchants,
and the interest from now on until
July 31st when the final count will be
made will be intense. The race It
present is close and a few thousand
votes would materially alter the stand
ing, and it is now up to the contest
ants to put forth their best efforts
in the next two weeks, each with a
determination of possessing tie beau
tiful riano. It is also time for tte
friends of ths joung ladies to show

109 BOOTLEGGING
CASES IN COCHISE
County Attorney Ross, of Cochise
County, Files Large Number of
Whiskey Cases Many More to
Come; Several Cases Against Each
Defendant.
Tombstone, July 10. County At
torney Ross toaay filed in the Super
ior Court a total of 109 bootlegging
cases, following the arrests of sever
al days ago. Mr. Ross stated there
would be two or three times that
amount filed shortly, in which case
there would be at least 500 cases in
all. There are as high as seven
cases against one of the defendants
in which the evidence is at hand,
and if all tried will keep the court
working the year around.
Mostly all the men arrested last
week have furnished bond for their
appearance, but there still remain in
jail a small number who have been
unable to furnish bail bond. The
cases will be set at some future date
for hearing before the Superior Court
no preliminary having been necessary
under the new procedure, adopted
when the arrsets were made. The
prisoners were arraigned in the Su
perior Court instead of the justice
court, as usual.
This is probably the largest number
of cases ever filed at one time in the
history of the state for bootlegging
since the prohibition law went into
effect.
THE SECOND
SHOWS
GOUNTY
REPUBLICANS END
CO MENTION
WORK
PRESCOTT, July 8 Before the re
publican state convention adjourned
Thursday afternoon, the campaign
committee, consisting of one member
from each county was selected, mem
bers being chosen by the respective
delegation committees to make recom
mendations to fill vacancies among
the officers of state committee, to
plan a militant campaign in the state,
and to co-operate with the. state com
mittee's officers in conducting the
campaign. The motion was carried
and the committee immediately was
selected.
During a recess, the campaign com
mittee held an important meeting, rec
ommended Thos. Maddock for the va
cancy in state chairmanship, caused
by the resignation of Judge Joseph H.
Kibbey. Andrew P. Baumert, Jr., of
Phoenix, was recommended for secre
tary of the state committee and W.
C Foster of Phoenix for treasurer.
Recommendations later were approv
ed at a meeting of the state confmittee
called by Judge Kibbey, retiring chair
man. When the convention reconvened,
following the noon recess, the report
of the committee on credentials was
read by James R. Dunseath, secre
tary of committee on credentials, and
was adopted.
E. S. Clark, chairman of the com
mittee on platform and resolutions
made an informal report reiterating
the platform adopted at Tucson, in
dorsing the action of Chicago conven
tion and recognizing the beneficient
effect of the prohibition amendment
to the state constitution and com
mending it and all officers of the
law who have aided in its strict en
forcement. The committee was con
tinued and directed to issue on behalf
of the convention an address to the
'voters of the state.
Upon motion of W. H. Smith, of
Pima, the convention then went into
executive session to consider candi
dates for state offices. At this ses
sion it was found that there were
active candidates for nearly every
office, and when the executive ses
sion arose, a resolution was adopted
to the effect, that because the nomina
tion, of Hughes at Chicago had been
received in Arizona with unbounded
enthusiasm, there were active candi
dates for nearly every office and that
specific recommendations for state
and federal officers other than presi
dential electors were unnecessary and
convention pledged its support to any
candidate chosen by republican party
at the ensuing primaries.
Here is campaign committee: .
Apache, J. L. Hubbell; Coconino,
Fred W. Smith; Cochise, to be select
ed; Gila, Robert Merritt; Graham, to
be selected; Greenlee, J. C. Gatti;
Maricopa, R. E. Sloan; Mohave, Dan
Worth; Navajo, J. E. Kleindienst; Pi

T TAX
Will Work for Defeat of Plan to
Classify Mining as Munitions
Work.
TUCSON, July 12. Telegrams ex
pressing their support of the position
of the Tucson chamber of commerce
protesting against the proposed tax
on the copper mining industry, were
received by Secretary Myers, of the
chamber of commerce this week from
Senators Ashurst and Mark Smith, at
Washington.
. Both senators indorsed the stand of
the Tucson chamber of commerce in
opposing the proposed mine tax and
stated that they would do their ut
most when the time came o defeat the
tax on Arizona's most important in
dustry. The telegram of protest sent by the
Tucson chamber of commerce to
Senators Ashurst and Smith was as
follows:
"Understand Revenue bill reported
by Ways and Means Committee of
house, contains proposal to tax cop
per smelting and refining. This in
dustry should not be singled out and
attacked because temporarily prosper
ous, on account of present high price
of copper, and should not be classed
as war industry. Will work great
hardships on this state. Do your ut
most to defeat.
"Tucson Chamber of Commerce."
W. E. Kelly, cashier of the Metcalf
State Bank, accompanied by his wife
spent the week-end in Clifton.

PROGRESSIVES OF
COLORADO NOT
FOR HUGHES
DENVER, July 8. Progressives of
Colorado at an "open meeting" tonight
declined to endorse Charles E. Hughes
for president; decided to continue the
state organization and authorized
Chairman C. P. Dodge to call at a
later date a state assembly, at which
it is expected state and county tick
ets will be placed in the field this fall.
The declination of Hughes' endorse
ment took the form of a resolution in
which it was recommended to the
state central committee that no in
dorsement be made officially of any
of the national candidates and that
the progressives be left to express
their individual convictions .upon na
tional issues.
The central committee at a later
meeting followed the recommendation.
The debate at times grew spirited,
but the action taken was practically
unanimous.
At a meeting of the state executive
committee, county organizations were
authorized to take such steps as they
separately deemed necessary with re
gard to county issues.
The coming state assembly is to be
held in Denver at a date to be selected
by and at the call of Clarence P.
Dodge, state chairman.

ESTIMATED BUDGET
FOR YEAR
1917
Board of Supervisors Make Budget
for 1917 Comparison of Figures
With Those of the Year 1916.
The estimated expense for carry
ing on the affairs of the county for
the year 1917 have been made by the
Board of Supervisors, and while In
most cases the figures remain the
same or show a slight variation, the
total expense for running the county
government for the year 1917 will not
vary to a great extent from that of
the present year. The largest In
crease has been made in the sheriffs
office the estimate for 1917 being
$27,900.00 compared with $20,000 for
this year. $1500 of this increase is
credited to ranger deputies which of-'
fleers were not on the pay roll in
1916. Jailor and guard salaries at
Clifton and Morenci have been la-'
creased over the present year la the
sum of $3600.
The estimate for the health de
partment has also been increased
$1740 over that for the present year.
While several of the items have been
cut, the largest increase for 1917
is $1000 for quarantine and sanita
tion. The road fund has been la
creased $22,929.77, this being account
ed for by a great deal of new road
work which will be completed next
year, the majority of this amount to
be used for the building of the Dun
can and Ash Springs road and Mo
renci loop. High schools and man- -ual
training have received an in
crease of $2,047.15.
A comparison of the figures for the
two years which follow will make
interesting reading and will give the
taxpayers an idea of what is be ins

MUST HIKE WITH
SOLELESS
SHOES
Eighty Arizona Guardsmen. Ordered
to Naco Without Proper Footwear.
DOUGLAS Much dissatisfaction is
being expressed at the camp of the
Arizona National Guard today over
the failure of the proper authorities
to provide all the men with the nec
essary uniforms and equipment. In
Troop C, 127 men, which is formed
by residents of Tempe and surround
ing points in the Salt River valley.
80 men who have not yet received
their uniforms. They are still In
civilian clothes.
The worst feature is that they are
also without suitable shoes. Their
footwear has been worn out in their
military work. In many cases their
feet are already on the ground. Un
der these circumstances they are
under orders to begin a march of 27
miles to Naco in the morning. There
is half-serious talk of refusing to ko.
The men feel that thejl have not
been given a square deal.
Borrow Money for Clothes.
One officer said today that he had
lent $150 to his men to buy uniforms.
He purchased his own uniform.and Is
still wearing the shoes he had on
when he left home.
One of the companies came in
last night from patrol duty at Forrest
to join the batallion for the march to
Naco, and is said to have presented a
sad appearance, wet, muddy, hungry
and without a change of clothing.
it made me cry; it seemed un-
American," said an officer today. "It
is a shame to treat men that way
after they have in many instances
left comfortable homes to perform
their duty as volunteer soldiers on
the border. Somebody is to blame."
Return from Eagle
Mrs. H. A. Grady and Miss
Blanche Nicks, who have been visit
ing with friends In the Eagle coun
