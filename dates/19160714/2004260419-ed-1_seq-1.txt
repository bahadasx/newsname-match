lature which Multnomah county controlled. Ancient history
tolls us Columbia comity once hail a senator In the Oregon aen
ate, Judge Moore, about, thirty years nno. Perhaps Claekiuiins
county has bail a Joint senator aince that time, but It doe not
matter to them for they have one aenator all of their own In
inlilitioii to their (?) Joint senator. Hut Columbia county, with
Km 115,000 people, It im.sea.setl valuation of $17,000,000 antl Its
thousands of acres of fertile soli, must he content to be In this
Joint (or Multnomah) district, H Is not right; the legislature
should "hook" uh on to Clatsop county, where wo would have lit
leant more than one break In thirty yearn. We will never get It
by being tho appendage to Multnomah's kite. If the commitUK.
men of Cliitkamiia can be convinced of this, It might lie possible
that some good clllen of cither Columbia or Clackamas may be
aeimtor to succeed McHrltle, although all of the woods in the
Multnomah forest are now full of candidates. John McCue, K.

others are aimkeii of, but we haven't heard of a Columbia county
man Our commlHeeineii should take note of this mid bring it
to the attention of the Clackamas delegation, and, out of fair
ness Clackamas should aland by Columbia for they have one
senator all by themselves. The poind" of the county will watch
with Interest 'liw our committeemen stand, whether their small
force of 21 men will capitulate to Multnomah's SSO, or will they,
like our troopers at Carri.iil, combat with the superior (numeri

CITY OF PORTLAND

Tho City of Portlund Is now docked
at tho St. Helens Lumber Company's
wharves and is receiving cargo for
delivery In Australia. It is under
stood that the stevedoring coucern
who has tho contract for loading her

agreement und union men will work
cargo aboard tho vessel, so no delay
is expected. The date for sailing has
not jet been set, but all possible dis

City of Portland came dowu from the
shipyard at noon Thursday and cre
ated much favorable comment on the
way she handled and hor general ap

THE RAINIER
CHAUTAUQUA
Tho Rainier Chautauqua closed
this week after a very successful sea
son. This is the second -ear for this
enterprise and the bustling business
men and women of our sister city
certainly deserve congratulation for
their efforts.
The program was up to the stand
ard and the attractions were equal
to those of the larger places. Those
who attended from this place are
loud in their praises and regret that
they could not onjoy the entire pro
gram. Sunday evening the great Victor
Murdock of Kansas delivered his fam
ous oration entitled "Uncle Sam's To
morrow." The Rojal Hungarian Or
chestra attracted the largest number
of our citizens and they felt amply
repaid for the visit. It was certainly
a great musical treat and much en
Joyed. The local Chautauqua organization
has already formulated preliminary
plans for next year nnd it Is the in
tention to make this an annual event.
Rainier is determined to occupy a
prominent placo on the intellectual
map.
