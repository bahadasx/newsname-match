went to first. After stealing second,
he came home when Evans singled to
left.
Evans went to second on the throw-
In and scored on Booser's bingle. Dav
is threw wide trying to catch Booser
at second, and another tally was In.
Another was counted in the sixth on

drive over the right field fences. The
Browns didn't threaten again until the
ninth, when a small rally was staged.

ond, scoring DIppold. Davis walked
and Lansing was safe when Hoskamp

LONDON', July 14. British troops
broke the German line on a four-mile
front at dawn today with a smashing
blow that swept the British lines into
the villages of l-ongueval and Bazen
tim and cleared the Trones woods,
an advance of more than a mile. The
gain is the greatest scored by the Anglo-French
offensive since the opening
of the great assault thirteen days agj.
Special dispatches from headquar
ters announced the capture of the vil
lages and the clearing of the woods.
The dispatches said the blow was
struck at every sector of the battle
front. The early bulletins this eve
ning, though meager, indicated that
one of the greatest battles perhaps In
the history of the world is being
waged in the wooded region north
east of Albert today.
The British advance apparently was

BALTIMORE, July 14. Super-Zeppelins
capable of carrying passengers
probably will be operating soon be
tween Germany and the United States,
Captain Paul Koenig of the German
super-submersible Deutschland indi
cated today.
"We are building them." he said,
"and they are large enough to hold
forty passengers."
"Are they coming here?" he was
asked.
"They might," he answered with a
knowing smile. Manager Hilken of
the corporation owning the Deutsch
land re-echoed his sentence. "I knew
about the Deutschland six months be
fore it arrived," chimed in Hilken sig
nificantly. "I didn't tell all about it.
but you can say that the Zeppelins
may come."
"Will they carry freight?" Koenig
was asked.
"No, just passengers."
The Deutschland will be ready to
start for Germany within a day. Her
holds were rapidly filled with nickel
and copper, and ever thing was ar
ranged whereby she could make a
swift and safe getaway. A hydro
plane, stored secretly, will be used to
mark a trail past the Virginia capes.
The Deutschland will take the chance
of running the blockade immediately.

in the matter. This means, it is un

considered a merchantman and per
mitted to clear.
