COMMITTEE WILL INSPECT MA
CHINES AND OILED STREETS
AT MINNEAPOLIS TODAY
A special meeting of the city coun
cil was held at the city hall Wednes
day afternoon at 4 o'clock, being call
ed for the purpose of considering the
purchase of a machine or the appli
cation of oil on -the streets of the city,
as a substitute for sprinkling with wa
ter.
O' Ekberg, representing the Aus
tin-Western Road Malcbine company
of Chicago, addressed the council in
regard to the machine and what it will
do. The machine which he wants to
sell to the city is listed at about $650.
The machine is equipped with a
heater with which the oil is heated
before it is applied to the roadway.
It is put on with a high pressure, and'
according to the representative, it is
not necessary to sprinkle the streets
with it more than two or three times
a year.
Mr. Ekberg made a proposition to
the council offering to pay the ex
penses of a committee to go to Minne
apolis and make a thorough inspection
of the streets there on which oil is used
and of the machines used. F. E. Hall,
H. J. LaFond and Elias Brown of the
council and Isaac LaFond, street com
missioner, were selected as the com
mittee^ and they will go down to Min
neapolis this morning and will return
tonight.

DELL BATTERS GIVEN CONTRACT
TO PAINT BRIDGES—MAY
GET DRINKING FOUNTAINS
A regular adjourned meeting of the
city council was held at the city hall
Monday evening, aldermen Hall,
Blake, Brown, Moeglein, John and La
Fond being present.
Dell Batters was awarded the con
tract to paint the Broadway bridge
and the north wagon bridge, for the
sum of $325. There was only one oth
er bid for the work, from a man from
St. Cloud, but no certified check ac
companied his bid and it was also $25
higher than the Batters bid.
A permit was granted the A. W.
Lane company to use a part of the
street in front of the new postoffice
site during the construction of the
building.
City Clerk Schallern was instructed
to write the secretary of the League
of Municipalities, of which this city
is a member, stating that this city has
received numerous benefits as a result
of its being a member of that organi
zation.
Alderman Ha*ll brought up the mat
ter of installing public drinking foun
tains in this city. He suggested plac
ing? one at the city square, one near
the L. D. Brown drug store, one near
the Buckman hotel, one at the inter
section of Broadway and Kidder
street and possibly one or two on the
west side. Alderman Moeglein stated
that in his opinion the public drinking
fountain would be a needless and
wasteful expense and he sought to
compare its possible value with that
of the traffic guide signs, which were
used here some time ago. Other alder
men were of the opinion that the traf
fice guide signs did a great deal of
good and they also believed that the
drinking fountains would be appreci
ated by the public. Alderman Hall
stated that they could be purchased
at from $20 to $30 each. The chair
was finally instructed to appoint a
committee of three to investigate the
advisability of installing the fountains
and report at a later meeting. Alder
men LaFond, Brown and John were
appointed on this committee.
A representative of the Austin
Western Road Machine company of
Chicago brought up the matter of the
use of oil on the streets by this city.
He stated that the cost of applying
the oil would be about $30 per biock,
including cost of material, labor and
depreciation of machinery. He said
that the oil would have to be
applied to the streets only twice a
year. A machine is manufactured by
this concern which is especiallv
adapted to sprinkle the oil on the
streets, putting it on with a pressure.
The cost of one of these machines is
about ,$500. It is likely that the city
will take steps in the 'near future to
have the streets sprinkled with oil.
The streets have been treated in this
manner before and the city owns a
large oil tank. The street committee
was asked to look into the matter and
to report as soon as possible.
Street Commissioner LaFond was
authorized to purchase two culverts to
be placed on the road leading into the
city from the south, passing the hos
pital.
The building committee wrs in
structed to have the lean-to at the west
side hose house repaired.

STATE COMMISSION FAVORS
EAST AND WEST ROUTES
DECISION WEDNESDAY
Word has been received here to the
effect that the state highway commis
sion last Monday recommended to tho
Jefferson highway commission the
eastern and western routes through,
this state. It is understood that the
Jefferson highway commission will
make its final decision Wednesday.
July 19.
The eastern route is from Minneapo
lis to Elk River, thence northeast to
Princeton and north to Mille La«g tok*
and Brainerd and thence on up to the
border. The western router is from
Minneapolis to St. Cloud, thenee to
Sauk Centre, Alexandria, Detroit anA
into the Red River valley to Fargo,
thence to Crookston and to the boun
dary. The commission also recom
mended a loop from Sauk Centre to
Long Prairie and Detroit and through
the state park, on the western route.
Although the above two routes may
be designated, thereby leaving Little
Falls out, this does not mean that
there may not be a change sometime in
the future, as the routes designated, in
order to stay on the highway, must
properly maintain the roads.
The action of the commission is con
sidered rather peculiar by those well
acquainted with all the routes.
NO FUNERALS AT BIGGEST
CHURCH YET THIS YEAR
That the death rate in this city has
been unusually low during the last six
or seven months is indicated by the
fact that St. Francis Xavier church

a funeral since the first of January of
this year. This is one of the largest
parishes in the city, with approxi
mately nine hundred members, includ
ing children. Rev. Fr. Lamothe, in
charge of this church, states that the
record is unparalleled in the history
of the church, to his knowledge.
All other churches here have had
only a few funerals in all so far this
year.
