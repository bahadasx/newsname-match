FIND KO GLUES OF
ESWEO FRISK
GILLIES AND ROBERTS MAKE
(>OOD THEIR BREAK FROM
LOCAL JAIL.
No definite clues have yet been ob
tained to the route taken by J. F-
Gillies, convicted of looting the state
industrial insurance funds of more
than $20,000, and Henry Roberts,
convicted of a statutory crime against
a young girl, who sawed their way
out of the county jail last Saturday
night.
Chester Bateman, a local chauffeur,
admits having driven the pair, dress
ed like women, to Chehalis, and the
Lewis county sheriff reports that per
sons answering their description pur
chased tickets at the depot there ear
ly Sunday morning, for East St.
Johns, a suburb of Portland. One
rumor has it that they headed for
Idaho, another that they were bound
for Mexico, while a third suggests
that they are hiding in the woods not
far from Olympia.
Aside from sending out circulars
to the authorities of Northwest cities,
containing photos of Gillies and Rob
erts, their description and a state
ment of the reward offered, Sheriff
Fred W. McCorkle has not instituted
a personal search for the escaped
prisoners, or attempted to ascertain
what local persons assisted them in
the escape. Private detectives, how
ever, are reported to be working on
the case, while railroad detectives
have also taken up the search.
Escaped Saturday Night.
Gillies and Roberta sawed their
way out of the jail some time Satur
day night, presumably about 10
o'clock, but the Jail-break was not
discovered until 8 o'clock Sunday
morning, when the cries of J. McDon
ald, an aged prisoner held for want
of bonds to keep the peace, were
heard- Deputy Sheriff J. H. Gifford
came down at 8:30 o'clock to give
them breakfast and found the pair
missing.
Gillies was to have been taken to
the state penitentiary at Walla Walla
on July 21, when his time limit for,
an appeal to the supreme court ex
pires, and Roberts would have been
taken away to the reformatory at
Monroe as soon as the supreme court
sent down the remittitur on his peti
tion for a rehearing.
Thurston county has no jailer, and
as Game Warden James Fennell, who
slee|fe in the jail while in Olympla,
had been out of the city for several
days, the pair worked unmolested.
Sheriff McCorkle himself was in Cen
tralia, planning to spend Sunday
there, but returned at noon when he
learned of the escape.
Mrs. Guiles Denies Complicity.
Immediately upon learning of the
escape, Prosecuting Attorney Geo. F.
Yantis notified the authorities of the
surrounding towns and then ordered
the arrest of Mrs. Gillies and Chester
Bateman, the chauffeur who admits
he drove the pair, dressed as women,
to Chehalis. Mrs. Gillies insists she
knows nothing about the affair,
though Bateman claims she arranged
with him for the use of his auto. He
was released Monday on a SI,OOO
bond furnished by Fred W. Convery
and Emil Martensen.
The prisoners left a plain trail as
to the manner of their escape. With
a saw that evidently was passed to
them therough the side window to
the jail they cut the riveted end off
the door bolt of their cell, evidently
a day or two before, as a magazine
Picture was pasted over it.
Saturday night they took out the
bolt, about 10 inches long. With
this as a lever they broke the pad
lock of the "bull pen" door. The
sheet Iron door on this they opened
by prying off the Inside of the lock
*nd removing the bolts, swinging it
open on its hinges.
Escape From Building Easy.
They then proceeded to the room
where Fennell sleeps, where by
opening a common door lock they
reached the little Iron door In the
barred window, where they got out
of the building by dropping a dis
tance of 12 feet on to the ground.
Mrs- Gillies lives within half a
block of the county Jail, in a house
Just across the street from the alley
leading to the Jail. Mrs. Roberts,
the mother of Henry Roberts, lives
lust a block from Mrs. Gillies' place

EXPECTS CHAUTAUQUA
TO BE BIG SUCCESS
ADVANCE TICKET SALE FOR
OLYMPIC'S ENTERTAINMENT
WEEK IS PROMISING.
With two-thirds of the guaranteed
600 tickets already sold, according to
the report of J. M. Hitt, chairman of
the sales committee, the campaign for
Olympia's first Chautauqua week is
progressing satisfactorily and the lo
cal guarantors are confident that the
week's entertainment will be a big
success.
The ticket selling campaign was
started off with a rush this week with
a big automobile parade Monday ev
ening, led by the local band. Bach
of the 40 guarantors has been assign
ed a district and made responsible
for the ticket sales in that district,
and the live-wire members of the lo
cal committee have been making a
systematic canvass of the city. The
result is they feel confident that when
the Chautauqua opens next Monday,
the guarantee of 600 tickets will be
over-sold. After Monday noon the
Ellison-White Chautauqua System
takes over the sale of the tickets,
and the price advances to $3.
Reports received from other cities
where the Chautauqua has already
appeared are very enthusiastic over
the program. On Monday, the open
ing day, Judge Wanamaker of the
Ohio supreme court will deliver his
great lecture, "The People and the
Courts." Judge Wanamaker, who
has been contributing several articles
lately to the Saturday Evening Post,
is a national authority and has a
message with a strong appeal.
Two Operatic Concerts.
On the same day the International
Operatic company will give two con
certs, afternoon and evening. - This
is reported to be an exceptional mu
sical organization- Burt McKinnie
was leading baritone with the Savage
Grand Opera company, while Tekla
Farm was formerly prima donna su
prano with Mme. Schumann-Heink
and Miss Heidenrelch was formerly
with the National Grand Opera com
pany.
Tuesday the Russian violinist, Ski
binsky, with his company, will ap
pear In two concerts, and this prom
ises to be a notable musical event
here as It has everywhere on the
Chautauqua circuit. In the after
noon Charles Zueblin, the great civic
expert of Boston, will deliver his ad
dress on "The New Civic Spirit," a
lecture which it is said no business
man or person interested In the wel
fare of this city can afford to miss.
In the evening comes Lou Beau
champ, a humorist famous the world
over and heralded as one of the
greatest treats of the Chautauqua.
Wednesday, July 19, Is bond day
—a day of wonderful music, furnish
ed by the New York City Marine
band, which rankß high among the
great American bands. It will ap
pear In two full concerts, afternoon
and evening, assisted In the evening
by Donald Bouchler, operatic tenor
soloist.
Other Attractions of Week.
The rest of the week will be
crowded with good things—Francis

GERMANS SEND FIRST
U-BOAT ACROSS OCEAN
Giant Submarine, With $1,000,000
Cargo, Docks in Baltimore
Harbor.
The flrst-time-in-history trip across
the Atlantic of the world's largest
submarine ended in the harbor of
Baltimore, Md., Monday morning,
when the "Deutschland," laden with
a $1,000,000 cargo of dyeetuffs, suc
cessfully closed its daredevil journey
from Germany. When customs men
and doctors scrambled aboard the
submarine they wrote finis to the
first chapter of one of the biggest and
most dramatic marine gambles of all
time.
This is authoritatively stated by
its captain to be but the first of a
fleet of eight submarine merchant
men built by Bremen merchants, the
second of which is already on its way
to the United States from Bremen.
The Deutschland left Heligoland
June 23, and expects to start within
the next week on its return to Ger
many with a cargo of rubber and
metals. Meanwhile, official investi
gation by the United States has es
tablished that the Deutschland is an
ordinary merchantman, bearing no
arms of any kind.
Astonishment was expressed on
every hand at the Germans' feat and
the remarkable journey past lurking
allied ships across the Atlantic —the
running of a blockade that England
had claimed could not be pierced.
The Deutschland is the first vessel
under the German merchant flag to
enter an American port since the
days of the war, w hen Teutonic
craft raced In to save themselves
from British warships.
"Great Britain cannot hinder boats
such as ours going and coming as we
please," says the captain's official

HOUSE PASSES WILSON'S
TARIFF BOARO MEASURE
Revenue Bill Also Increases Income
Tax and Levies on Munitions—
Repeals War Stamps.
The administration omnibus reve
nue bill, creating & tariff commission,
imposing a protective tariff on dye
stuffs, repealing present stamp taxes
and providing for new taxes on in
comes, inheritances and war muni
tions profits, passed the house late
Tuesday.
The bill, which now goes to the
senate, increases the surtax on in
comes ranging from an additional 1
per cent on incomes between $20,000
and $40,000 to 10 per cent additional
on those above $500,000, and taxes
transfers of estates valued at $50,000
or more and net profits of war muni
tions manufactures, With an exemp
tion to those having less than 10 per
cent profit. The new taxes are ex
pected to yield $197,000,000 an
nually.
The proposed tariff commission is
to be composed of five members, no
more than three to be of the same
political party, and is to have broad
powers of investigation. The bill
also carries an anti-dumping provi
sion to protect American producers
from unfair foreign trade practices.
Call for Bids on School.
The directors of school district No

PBICE FIVE CENTS
v STATE'S TRADE DOUBLES.
Big Increase in Value of Industrial
Products from 1004 to 1014.
Lumber and timber production in
he state of Washington was increased
from $54,990,000 to $83,536,000 in
the 10 years from 1904 until 1914,
according to a census of the principal
industries of the state just completed
by Director Rogers, of the federal
census bureau.
This Increase was made despite the
fact that the number of lumber and
timber establishments was 166 less in
1914 than in 1904. The banner year
for production was 1909, when the
output of 1,263 establishments was
valued at $89,155,000.
The value of the products of all In
dustries in the state increased from
$128,822,000 to $245,326,000 during
the 10 years, rising from the former
figures in 1904 to $220,746,000 in
1909 and to the latter figures in 1914.
PROPOSE PURCHASE
OF CARLYON TRACT
GRANGES ENDORSE PLAN, BUT
AGRICULTURAL BUREAU
TURNS IT DOWN.
Whether Thurston county should
purchase the Carlyon tract of 32
acres on the southern edge of the
city for a county poor farm and hos
pital, and a site that could be leased
to a fair association, may be deter
mined by the county commissioners
next Monday. The proposition has
been pending for several weeks and
endorsed by eight of the subordinate
granges of the county, though reject
ed by the Agricultural Bureau of the
Chamber of Commerce.
The purchase of the tract is said
to be looked upon favorably by the
county commissioners, who have
called for expressions of opinion from
the organizations of the city and
county. Unlike four years ago, when
a somewhat similar proposal was
voted down by about 3 to 1, the sen
timent in the county, so far reported,
has been unanimously in favor of it
The general proposition calls for
the purchase of the tract for $32,000,
an allowance of $6,000 for the pres
ent 20-acre poor farm cutting the
cash outlay down to $26,000. The
commissioners, however, may propose
a lower figure as the net amount to be
paid by the county for the property.
The payment recently of some $160,-
000 in back taxes by the Weyerhaue-
ser interests, paying off all the bond-
Ed and warrant indebtedness of the
county and giving it a considerable
cash balance besides, as well as the
renewed interest in the county fair
plans, prompted a revival of the pro
ject.
Arguments Against Purchase.
The Agricultural Bureau's disap
proval of the project followed a heat
ed discussion at a special meeting
Tuesday night, at which various ob
jections, including the price of the
property, the advisability of making
a change from the present poor farm,
the likelihood that sites considered to
be as good or better could be ob
tained for much less, and the cost
and advisability of maintaining a
poor farm, county hospital, demon
stration farm and county fair all in
one place, were made.
The proposition was originally put
before the Bureau at its regular
meeting last Friday night, but be
cause of the small attendance then,
it was decided to call a special meet
ing later. Some 15 or 20 members
attended Tuesday night's gathering
and argued the proposal pro and con
—principally con—for an hour and
a half, and then voted it down.
Commissioner Littlejohn stated
that he preferred to put the proposi
tion up to a vote at the general elec
tion again this fall, but Carlyon's rep
resentative, O. H. Hartscon, asserted
that if the county wanted to buy the
tract it would have to do so now, or
else it would be sold to Seattle par
ties, who, he said, plan to cut it up
into smaller plots and put it on the
market.
Donated for Fair.
" The county fair was held on this
site last year, the grounds being do
nated. and similar arrangements had
been made with Mr. Carlyon for this
year's show in September. One of

PIONEERS DO HONOR
TO FIRST SETTLERS
UNVEIL MONUMENT AT TUMWA
TKR TO MEMORY OF SIM
MONS' PARTY.
With a series of addresses remin
iscent of events of pioneer days and
laudatory of those who established
the first United States settlement on
Puget Sound at Tumwater in Octo
ber, 1845, the members of the Thur
ston County Pioneer & Historical so
ciety and a host of friends unveiled
a monument at Tumwater Wednes
day to the memory of Colonel Mich
ael Troutman Simmons, George Bush
and the 29 other members of the col
ony. The guests of honor of the day
were the children and grandchildren
of these first pioneers.
The affair was the annual mid
summer reunion of the local pio
neers, in which they were joined by
members of the Pierce county society
and by pioneers from all parts of the
state. It started with a program in
the grove near Tumwater at 10
o'clock In the morning, the invoca
tion being delivered by P. D. Moore,
91 years old, the oldest person at the
gathering and also one of the earliest
pioneers.
General Hazard Stevens, president
of the local society, son of the first
governor of the territory, and well
known to every pioneer present, de
livered the address of welcome,
which was responded to by Judge O.
G. Ellis of the state supreme court,
representing the Society of the Sons
of the American Revolution, and
George H. Himes, a former Olympian
and secretary of the Oregon Pioneer
and Historical society. Following
these addresses, a* big picnic dinner
was served, under the direction of
Mrs. J. W. Mowell, the tables being
'arranged to accommodate 400 per
sons.
Governor First Speaker.
President P. M. Troy of the Cham
ber Commerce, chairman of the ar
rangements committee for the local
society, presided at the afternoon ses
sion, introducing Governor Lister aa
the first speaker. He paid a glowing
tribute to the sturdy men and wom
en who laid the foundations for the
great state of Washington, and re
minded his hearers that, while other
states erect monuments to their
great men, they were usually in hon
or of those who had military records,
while this monument was to do hom
age to the men and women who had
endured all sorts of hardships in op
ening up a new country.
The history of the Simmons expe
dition was told by Professor Edmond
S. Meany of the University of Wash
ington, president of the State His
torical association, a feature of hia
address being a public congratula
tion and salute to General Stevens.
A special greeting to the descendants
of Colonel Simmons—George Wash
ington Simmons, tbe oldest son,
Francis Marion Simmons and Chris
topher Columbus Simmons—was giv
en by W. P. Bonney, secretary of the
State Historical society. Mayor C. S.
Lee of Tumwater, who had known
Jesse Ferguson, one member of the
Simmons' party, thanked the heirs
of the late Leopold F. Schmidt, who
presented the monument to the so
ciety.
The monument was then unveiled,
the big American flag being unfurled
by Mrs. Bertha Simmons Falrson,
youngest daughter of Christopher C.
Simmons, Miss Mary Bush, grand
daughter of George Bush, and Mr.
Simmons. The monument, which Is
a huge block of roughly hewn gran
ite, 10 feet high, set on a concrete
base and surrounded by a heavy iron
railing, is located along the Det
Chutes river a short distance from
the lower falls, where the party made
its first camp. A heavy bronse tablet
imbedded in the face of it, the gift of
the State Historical society, bears the
nimes of each member of the Sim
mons' party and an appropriate in
scription.
Simmons' Descendant* Present.
Quite a number of descendants of
; Colonel Simmons attended the picnic.
