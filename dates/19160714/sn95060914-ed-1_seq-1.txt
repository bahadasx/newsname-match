James Johnson Kills His Wife
and Then Commits
Suicide
James Johnson aged 48 years
while temporarily insane shot
and killed his wife last Wednes
day morning about 1100 oclock
and shot himself in the head the
bullet making only a slight
wound and then drank an ounce
of which he died shortly after
Ihe double tragedy occurred
on the Taylor and Pinedale road
about one mile southwest of Tay
lor Navajo county
The account of the tragedy
given by the Holbrook News
states that according to the story
told by their ten-year-old
1 er at the coroners inquest held I
at Taylor by Justice of the Peace
i Hatch Johnson and his wife and
little daughter left Holbrook
luesday morning for Pinedale
where they remained over night I
The child said her parents had
been quarreling from the timei
they left Pinedale until thev
reached the crossroads near Tay
lor At this point Johnson told
his wife who was driving to
stop the car and they would set-
tie their trouble When the car J
was stopped Johnson drew a
small 38 caliber revolver and said
he would shoot himself How
ever he
or remove apples or pears from tures wi1 be typical of nioneer I diinces making up a program of glanced and made only a slight
wound Johnson then walked to
a cedar stump about 40 yards
from the car hid the gun and
returned to his wifes body He
then drank about an ounce of
carbolic acid and laid down to
rtere he was louna
by
O j I
tjtate hiXlllblt e who had been notified of the
tragedy by the little girl He
was not dead when round but
died shortly after being taken to
Taylor
The unfortunate victims of this
double tragedy came to Holbrook
about two weeks ago from Globe
and purchased the White Help
Restaurant from C H Wisdom
who had purchased the establish
ment from them a year previous
ly That Johnson had for some
time meditated upon the course
he took Wednesday morning is
evident from the fact that early
last week he purchased the re
volver and the carbolic acid Also
the letters he had written to his
little daughter bore the date of
June 28th and told her partly of
his plans
That the man had gone insane
from brooding o er business and
family matters is the only chari
table construction that can be
placed upon his rash acts Funeral

Johnson who is the son of Mrs

BE APPONTFD 1
To Settle Border Dispute
Between United States
and Mexico
CARRANZA FAVORS PLAN
Conditions in Mexico May Be
Reviewed in Connection
with Border Troubles
Informal negotiations for set
tlement of border disputes be
tween the United States and the
de facto government of Mexico
are progressing favorably
Acting Secretary Polk said Wed
nesday after his second confer
ence with Eliseo Arredondo
Mexican ambassador designate
Although Mr Polk would not
add to this statement it is under
stood that it is now assured the
steps being taken foreshadow
appointment of commissioners by
each government to formulate a
plan of action for the permanent
relief of border conditions
Mr Arredondo has not
changed his mind and Flof ed what his instructions are
started shooting at his wife who
had jumped from the car Two
shots went wild and then John
son leaped from the car caught
his wife with his left hand and
with his right fired a bullet into
her left breast Her death was
probably instantaneous as the
bullet evidently pierced the heart
After shooting his wife John
son carried her body into the
shadow of the car gave his money
and some letters to his little
daughter and told her to go to
Taylor to a relatives home He
then attempted to kill himself by
firing the last shot in the gun
into the right side of his head
near the temple The bullet
but from other sources it has
been learned that the commission
plan was favored by General
Carranza and his advisors and
would not be ordered by the state
department A formal announce
ment is expected soon
Whether the question submit
ted to the commission will fol
jow the definition of the matters
in dispute laid down in General
Carranzas latest note is not
known although Secretary Lin
sings reply apparently accepted
that definition
The Mexican set the reasonable
anxiety of the United States on
the one hand over the security
of its borders and the feeling of
the de facto government on the
other that the continued
ence of American troops in Mexi
Ico menaced friendly relations
1 constituted the problem for which
a solution must be found
There is no present indications
that a commission would go into
questions dependent upon these
1 main issues but not directly in-
volved in a settlement It is be
lieved probable however that
the whole subject of internal
conditions in Mexico including
the financial stress there would
be reviewed to some extent with
the possible result of some more
far reaching plan being proposed
than one embracing border con
ditions only
