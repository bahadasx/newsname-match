AUTOMOBILE WRECK
Three Prominent Men Over Em
bankment AH Escape Injury
Lucky Candidates
Friday afternoon about 6:30,
Hon. Thos. Edwards, Hon. Roy
McKittrick and attorney Clar
ence Brummall of Salisbury were
in the Edwards Studebaker car
enroute toAholt where McKit
trick was billed for a speech.
The trio reached the Chariton
river bridge atRockford about
the time designated. The road
turns abruptly to the bridge
from the north and it is impossi
to see the approach to the bridge
until within less than ten feet.
There is also a road leading to
the bridge from the south. These
two roads join at the east apron.
The banks of the river on each
side of the bridge are very steep,
in fact, almost perpendicular.
Mr. Edwards was driving his
car and turned the hill to cross
the bridge when he instantly
discovered a lot of loose plank
on the bridge and at the end
of the approach, evidently left
there by some one who had
crossed with a traction outfit
He wished to know the condition
of the approach before going on
it and undertook to turn his car
to the left and in the south road
until they could investigate. He
saw he could not make the turn
and tried to stop his car and
reached for the emergency brake
and while he was in the act,
the right front wheel went over
the embankment threw Edwards
out or he jumped, the machine
shot headfirst down, struck a
,.Jfidge .after, going over Edwards
and turned parallel with the
stream, threw McKittrick out
and tumbled into the river,
throwing Brummall beyond it in
deeper water. The machine
landed in water about three feet
deep and upright; Edwards in
a ditch which saved him from
being crushed as the machine
passed over him; McKittrick
landed on a rock ledge on hands
and knees and Brummall in
about 4 feet of water. McKit
trick was by far the worst suf
ferer from the mishap having
sustained a badly bruised and
otherwise injured knee-cap on
his right leg and more or less
damaged knee of his left leg
and numerous cuts and bruises
about his arms and body. Some
protruding bolts took away part
of Edwards clothing but left him
unhurt except for the fall.
Brummall got a badly scraped
face in some way and a plunge
after the old and approved style
and the car had the right lamp
twisted, the right spring put out
of place and shape, fender bent
and smashed.
McKittrick and the others pro
ceeded toAholt-in another car
but before they had ' reached
their destination, it was appar
ent that their injuries, especially
those received by McKittrick,
called for their hasty return to
Salisbury " even tho a surgeon
from this city had given first
aid. McKittrick had to take to
, ., bed where he still remains with
a very bad knee, the prospect
for having to remain in bed for
, some time being apparent
; , That the whole outfit was noc
destroyed is short of the mirac
ulous but little. It is 35 feet
from the top of the bank they
went over to the narrow beach
below, and almost perpendicular.
Opposing candidates for the
legislature and prosecuting attor
ney should avoid precipitation
unless they are sure their lucky
stars are also in the ascendency.
Landy Sneed of Nelson was
here this week on business.
Mrs. Richard H. .Tisdale
Ann M. Temple, daughter of
Geo. W. Temple and wife, was
born near Mendon, Chariton
county, Mo., March 1, 1843.
Died at her home in Keytesville,
Mo., July 6, 1916. Aged 73
years, 4 months and 5 days.
Her father was a native of
Tennesse, but came to this coun
ty in early life, where he mar
ried. After six years of mar
ried life Mrs. Temple died leav
ing the two children with the
brokenhearted husband. There
being little else he could do, the
father placed the children with
first one family and another to
board. Thus the girl lived,
without knowing the love of a
mother, and without the sacred
memories of a girlhood home to
carry through life and without a
home until married.
She was married to Richard II.
Tisdale, at the home of B. K.
Bell, February 10, 1859, Rev.
Warren officiating.
To this happy union eleven
children were born. Seven are
yet living. The deceased are:
William P., Ally, Claude and
Clarence. The living are: Mrs.
H. S. Halley, Richard H. Jr.,
G. T., Mrs. Mary Ashley, Mrs.
Wm. Tiilotson, Edgar and Miss
Roberta. These survive her
with fifteen grandchildren, three
greatgrandchildren and a host of
friends to mourn their loss.
Mrs. Tisdale wa3 converted in
early life at Prairie Chapel.
She united with the Methodist
Church and remained a faithful
member of the same until the
day of her death.
For more than fifty years she
walked by the side of her hus
band, leaning upon the arm of
one who was ever all devotion to
her, until the "Chariot of God"
removed him from her sight.
Then without him she went se
renely, unmurmuringly, until
suddenly the chariot again de
scended and took her to renew
again the sweet communion
which for three years had been
broken.
But the Old Home of earth is
gone though she is Diessea in
her new relations. The ' Home
coming" here is no more. But
the New Home yonder has glori
ously begun, and the Home
coming" there without one child
missing was that for which both
father and mother lived and
prayed while here.
And methinks, when redeemed
friends of Keytesville reach the
the "Home of the Soul", and
walk the streets of that blest
city, they will find her on the
front porch of her mansion,
greeting passers-by with the
same motherly smile which
cheered them here.
God calls our loved ones, but
we lose not wholly
What He hath given.
They live on earth, in thought
and deed, as truly
As in His Heaven".
A Friend.

THE EUROPEAN WAR
Germans Regaining from English
French Advancing Some
Russian Gain.
The fierce fighting along the
ninty mile front in France is
still progressing and the English
and French have gained several
miles of lost ground and several
German trenches besides captur
ing a number of prisioners and
guns. Accounts yesterday were
to the effect that the Germans
had been heavily reinforced
against the British armies and
were driving them back, and
that the French had made fur
ther advances. . The main effort
of the Germans appears to be
against the English and it is con
fidently predicted that they will
drive that army back beyond the
border of the regained ground.
The Russian army is still vic
torious in the east, tho ihere is
wide territory remaining between
the border of Russia and Aus
tria held by the Austnans and
the Russian advance not so rap
id. Mexico
Troops are being rushed to the
border notwithstanding the fact
that war had been averted by
Carranza acceeding to the de
mands of the adminstration.
Every railroad running thru
the state is carrying troops to
the border, the Wabash having
several train loads thru here this
week. - The boys in uniform ap
pear to be enjoying the pros
pect for seeing action and many
express themselves as being eag
er for a scrap. President Wil;
son's determination not to sacr
fice a single American if he can
reasonably prevent it is being
adhered to. There is nothing
going on down that way further
than the formation of bands for
purposes of raiding border towns
by Mexicans and placing of bor
der patrols by this country to
prevent.
Chapter Of Accidents
In addition to mistaking a man
up a tree for a bird and shooting
him, account of which will be
found in Salisbury Scrib
lings, and the automobile tumble
into the Chariton river at Rock
ford, there were numerous other
accidents in various parts of the
country, ranging from seri
ous runaways to finger and hand
cuts, irom Dinaers ana mowers
and bottles.
A. Senn of Indian Grove, 90
years of age, was returning across
the road from his garden when a
team belonging to Joe Gavin
was claiming the right of way
on the run. Mr. Senn was run
over and besides numerous
bruises, his leg was broken. A
surgeon was called from this city
and reduced the fracture and
patched the nongenarian up and
left him as comfortable as could
be expected under the circum
stances of his advanced age.
Two daughters of Henry Troe,
north west of town were driving
a buggy. The horses took fright
at something and ran away, over
turning the buggy and spilling
the occupants who were con
siderable scratched up, , one of
them sustaining a broken wrist
and perhaps internal injuries,
spitting of blood being tho evi
dence of more serious injury.
Hands, thumbs , and 'fingers
may be noticed bandaged every
where one goes, and poison oak
is abroad in the land extensively.
When dog days come look out for
rabies, for we will be in the

While hunting near Oil City,
W. H. Ownby seriously injured
a fellow hunter by shooting some

he mistook for the movements of
a bird. His surprise can be im
agined when a man came slid
ing down the tree, well pepper
ed with no. 8 shot with which
Mr. Ownby 's gun was loaded.
.The stranger had climed the tree
pin an effort to dislodge a squir
rel and while shaking the limb
attracted Mr. Ownby's attention.
It was purely an accident and
no blame was attached to any
one. No one regrets it more
than Mr. Ownby and he did all
he could to help relieve the pain
of the injured one.

UNDERSEA GRAFT LANDS
Deutschland Eludes Enemies and
Docks. German Submarine
Wonder World Astounded
Captain Kairig of the German
submarine Deutschland brot that
undersea craft from Germany
to this country in 16 days with
1000 ton cargo of much needed
German products landing at Bal
timore Sunday. The craft elud
ed enemy warships, cruisers,
mines, air-scouts and every oth
er hostile thing and had a fine
voyage. The captain says they
laid on the bottom of the English
Channel for ten hours, had cham
pagne, songs and a good time
generally with all sorts of enemy
craft above them and mines all
round.
The Deutschland is the first
ship of the kind to cross the
ocean a district of 4000 miles,
and the captain says he could
have gone 10,000 miles. The
submarine brot chemicals, dye
stuff and mail and it is announc
ed that a fleet of such is ready
to cross the ocean regularly in
trade with this country.
Protest was made by Great
Britain against the landing of
the submarine or any others, but
the administration holds that it
is the same Question which
was passed on favorably for
England and that we will trans
act business with the Germans
just as freely as with Great
Britian. All that is necessary is
for her to get her goods here any
way she chooses and take away
what she buys from u?. The
excuse made by England some
time ago for her traffic with this
country was that she could get
here and Germany could not.
Now because Germany has found
a way to trade with us, England
protests against us doing busi
ness with her. Evidently Presi
dent Wilson is as willing to deal
with Germany as with any other
country and his determination
to do so is endorsed by every neu
tral in America.
The entire world was astound
ed when the report that a Ger
man Submarine had landed on
our shores laden with a cargo
of merchandise was flashed to
all civilized countries and none so
outdone" as England. The
undertaking was considered pre
posterous and its accomplish
ments impossible, and the Ger
man commander is the hero of
all the world.
Dr. W. L. Northcott has domi
ciled his family in the cottage
known as the Ward home. His
household effects arrived Mon
day and he is one of us. On his
way here from Indiana Dr.
Northcott was in the wreck of
the Wabash accomodation be
tween St. Louis and Moberlv.
and he had some thrilling exper
iences. He was among the first
to reach the fireman who was
under the overturned engine.
Doe says the shaking up was
enough for all the passengers,
and while he escaped serious
injury, he was jarred loose from
himself in several places.
Elmer Tilson, bachelor, aged
35, died at the home of his fath
er, 5 miles northeast of here
Tuesday morning, after a long
illness of .tuberculosis. After fu
neral at the home remains were

cemetery on Wednesday. De
ceased was an exensplary man,

The good roads people of this
communityjwill have an ice cream
supper here Saturday for the
reason that this section of the
Keytesville-Macon road, while it
is conceded to be the best State
road out of Keytesville needs
some repairs and some of it needs
grading again and it is the stor
age of funds available that
prompts people to join us in
this method of supnlyinz the de-
deficiency, so this is an opportun
ity for everybody to help in this
good cause.as no one doubts the
wisdom of good roads. The cakes
will be donated by good cooks
residing along this road. There
