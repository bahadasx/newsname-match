WONDERFUL SUCCESS
Chautauqua Pleases, Interests and
Instructs Big Audiences at
Every Session.
The Colt Alber Chautauqua program
given in the big tent near the armory
closes Saturday with the San Carlo
Grand Opera company, but if it
had closed any day this week, tbe eight
hundred ticket holders would have felt
amply repaid for the cost of the ticket.
Starting with Sunday, the music
thrilled audiences of fifteen hundred
and the lecture by Dr. G. Whitefield
Ray was a revelation regarding the
wonderf nl countries of South America.
The facts are so startling as to be
almost unbelievable. The lecture was
illustrated with pictures showing that
country to contain the lowest and the
highest types of citizenship, the poorest
and theiichest peoples of earth, the most
beautiful bities, the largest harbor in
the world, the widest range of climate,
resources, religions and peoples on
earth.
Monday, the Copley Comedy Players
pleased the audiences at both sessions
but particularly in the evening when
they put on the laughable play, "Pub
licity." Dr. J. Whltcomb Brougher,
the brilliant Baptist preacher of Los
Angeles, held the rapt attention of the
big crowd in the afternoon with his
lectnre, "What's Under Your Hat", an
appeal to make more of one's self,
appreciate what you are capable of
doing for the world and being and
living so that you will add something
to the blessings of life.
Tuesday, the Metropolitan Male
Quartette, known as the "Master
Singers of Chautauquas,' gave a much
appreciated entertainment both after
noon and evening and were followed in
the evening by the soul stirring lecture
of Dr. Charles S. Medbury of Des
Moines, Iowa, on tbe subject, "Forty
Million Young Folks." He told of
conditions existing in this country to
day that are a disgrace to it; he urged
reforms and helps for the children of
the mines, of the streets, of the shops.
He implored for more laws and better
observance of laws preventing the ruin
of the young folks on whom the future
of America and the world rests now
more than ever.
Wednesday, the Florentine Musicians
were much appreciated, both afternoon
and evening. In the afternoon, Glenn
Frank of Boston, one of the county's
recognized thinkers, a brilliant orator,
a practical man of affairs, discussed the
'Re Setting of the World's Stage," an
open exposition of the conditions of the
world when the present war ends and
the plans for rebuilding the countries
destroyed, the attitude of this country
and the effect on it.
Germain, the most wonderful present
day i wizard, mystified tbe audience
Wednesday evening doing inconceiv
able things, and transporting his audi
ence to a fairy land in wonder and
admiration. '
Thursday, the White's Musical Re
viewfClub of Boston, composed of six
talented young ladies 'from six cities
in different parts of 'the United States,
were the musical attraction and kept
up the high standard set by the organi
zations of the other days. The costume
numbers were particularly pleasing.
Dr. Frank Fannon gave a talk In the
afternoon on "Community Spirit," that
should have been heard by every man
in the city. It would have helped him
t J help everybody else and himself at
the same time, and it helped everyone
to appreciate his own city, county and
state. In tbe evening he gave a talk
on home life that went straight home
to the mothers and fathers, and roused
them to the pleasures and duties of
home real home life.
Today's program of music by a well
known quintette and a lecture by tbe
world's most famous woman publicist,
Mis Ida M. Tarbell, closing with pic

value and pleasure.
Tomorrow the big musical event, the
San Carlos Grand Opera Company will
close a program worth many times in
money and thousands of times in pleas
ure, Instruction and satisfaction the
time and money invested.

LETTERS FROM CAMP
Camp Ferris, Grayling, July 12.
To weeks ago weather like that of
Tuesday and Wednesday night might
haVe caused hardship .among the
members of the brigade, now in camp
here. But by the means of hard
drills, long walks, open air living and
substantial food they have been
brought Into such shape that weath
er .conditions have little effect.
This is to their advantage as the
more they become accustomecflto heat
here,, the less they will mind the ex-i
treme heat of the border. Men who
have returned recently from the Rio!
Grande state that they feel the heat
here more than they did that of the .
south. This is attributed to the high 1
altitude and extreme aridity of the
southwest. Although the sun there
may blister and actually be hotter
than here, it does not become sultry
and one can exercise and breathe
with comfort.
According to Captain Hume of the
Infirmary of the Thirty-second infan
try, more than 75 per cent of the vac
cinations which were administered by
thej Owosso organization to members
of he infantry, have taken. This is
an (unusually hlgh per cent, he said,
especially when It is considered that
a large number of them had under
gone the small pox treatment before.
Aviator W. II. Blakley of New
York, who will have charge of the
aviation corps here, visited the in
firmary Wednesday. He expressed
admiration for the efficient man
ner, in which the Owosso unit han
dled the sickness and instituted sani
tary regulations In the regiment.
Captain Hume said that ten men were
treated Wednesday. The infirmary
dispatched five cases to the field hos
pital. The Infirmary Is now referred
to as the sanitary troops. It had
charge of a sanitary campaign re:
cently completed in the regiment.
- John Detwiler has present mem
bers' of the Infirmary with a box of
oranges, for which they are very
thankful. Members of the infirmary
and! Co. II received several boxes of
fruit from the King's Daughters and
Sons of Owosso. A letter from Mrs.
L. L. Conn, secretary of the organiza

the order, If they wished.
lie eaid a married man in his
company told him that if his family
were cared for he would Just as soon
remain with the guardsmen. He
showed a letter from his wife in
which she said all the many had been
spent for paying rent, and she had
none left to buy milk for the baby.
This woman, Captain Parker said,
had been overlooked by the Owosso
relief committee. "Many of the men"
he said, "don't want to go home, but
may have to, unless their families are
cared for. If they go, it will disrupt
the organization."

BLUE RIBBON RACES
Will Be Biggest Sporting Event in
., ... .. Years. ,
What promises to be tha greatest
racing in the history of the trotting
turf will be seen during the thirty
second annual Blue Ribbon meeting of
the Detroit Driving Club at tbe state
fair grounds, Jnly 24 to 29. To insure
contests in every mile the racing will be
on the thr e-heat plan, in other words,
every heat is a separate race. This will
eliminate the laying-up or waiting un
til the pace makers are exhausted. The
only way a horse can win is to be among
the first four in every heat and there
will be just three .heats in every race.
So popular is this system with the
horsemen of the country, that the entry
in the fixtures exceeds that of any other
year, and tbe final payment finds a
larger list of ellgibles than in the past.
The Merchants' & Manufacturers'
stake of $10,00Q is unnaually attractive,
for cue of the lot has shown 2:03 ability
and half a dozen are better than 2:05
trotters, so the record for the stake U
certain to be lowered If conditions are
favorable.
In the Board of Commerce stake of
$5,000 for 2:00 pacers there ate at least
ten that can pace in 2:04 or better and
one that has been in 2:02.
The same speed characterizes all of
the events. On Monday, July 24, there
are three purse races for $1,200 each.
The Board of Commerce stake Is the
Tuesday feature, three-yenr olds also
racing that day. The M. & M. is set
for Wednesday. Two stakes and the
free for-all are on for Thursday and

eling organization in the country, has
