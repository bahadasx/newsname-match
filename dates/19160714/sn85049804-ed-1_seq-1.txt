Minister at 8eeend Baptist Church
In Evamfton, III.—Erwets New Edlflec,
Adda New Members and ftaieee |36|
000 Hi Lees Than Four Yeare.
Bvanston, I1L—Georgia has the die
tinction of famishing to Illinois one of
the most aggressive Baptist ministers
In the state and a man wbo has won
the hearts of the people and has ac
complished much good. The Rev. I.
A. Thomas, D.-D., pastor of the Sec
ond Baptist church here, Is one of the
beet known clergymen In this section
of the country.
Dr. Thomas received his public school
and college training at Atlanta and
Macon, Ga. He attended the Central
college at Macon and also the Moore
house' college in Atlanta, which la one
of the largest and best known Institu
tions In the south for the training of
young men. At these two Instltntlons
he not only took the regular literary
REV. I. A. THOMAS, D. D.
course, but his theological training
also, and then a postgraduate course
at the University of Chicago.
It was Central City college that con
ferred on him the degree of master of
arts. He was formerly an active fig
ure In Georgia In the denominational
work. For five years he was president
of the state Baptist Young People's
union. He was for some time profes
sor of languages and higher mathe
matics in Central City college. He has
been an active and successful pastor In
Atlanta, Baxley and McRae, Ga. His
last work in Georgia was at Central
City college, which position he resign
ed to accept the pastorate of the Sec
ond Baptist church here In April, 1912
When he took charge of the church
Dr. Thomas found a small membership
worshiping in a dilapidated frame
building, with a seating capacity of
200. In his initial sermon he declared
that the building would have to come
down and one more suitable to the
needs of the people would have to be
erected. Within a few months the
building was torn down and the foun
dation laid for the present magnifi
cent building, one of the finest in- the
state. Dr. Thomas drew the plans
for the building, submitted them to
the church for approval and later turn
ed them over to an architect for per
fection. He then superintended the
erection of the church himself.
If there is such a thing as "the heart
of a city" it is there where the Second
Baptist«church Is located. It is at
least In the most important part of the
city, and the lot alone is valued at
$10,000. It Is Just one-half block from
the Evanston postofflce. The church
edifice Is valued At $40,000, and under
the leadership of Dr. Thomas $35,000
has been raised within three years and
ten months.
Perhaps it would be of Interest to
know that in addition to erecting the
most complete modern church In and
around Chicago 300 members have been
added to the church In Evanston.
After working a year or two among
the pastors and churches of the Bethle
hem Baptist association, of which he
was elected secretary the first year of
his residence in this city, Dr. Thomas
was elected to the moderatorship with,
out a dissenting vote. This association
includes some of the largest churches
of Chicago and vicinity. The Second
Baptist church held three notable ral
lies during 1915, with these results:
April 25, $2,000 Aug. 29, $2,600, and
Dec. 12( $3,126.62. These amounts were
devoted to the building fnnd. Special
funds were raised for the building fund
every month during the year.. The re
ceipts for 1915 were more than $16,000.
This success Is largely attributed to
the splendid organization of the mem
bership. The entire church Is divided
into eighteen auxiliaries. The ladles
of the church lyre divided into eight
circles, the men into four men's clubs,
which make a splendid laymen's move

LOVING THANKS FILIPINOS.
Ceuld Not Have Sucoeodod Without
People's Aid, Siys Bandmaster.
Manila, P. I.-Major Walter H. Lof
Iny, who recently retired as director of
the Philippine Constabulary band, ex
presses his appreciation of the people
ef the island in the following terms:
"To the People of Manila and the Phil
ippine Islands: fs
"In severing my qonnectlon with the
Constabulary band aifter fourteen years'
service I would belle my feelings if I
failed to express my deep regret at
this parting.
"It Is no trilling Incident'for a man
to sever the ties that bind him to a
work to which he has devoted his
heart and soul for so many years. And
If is no trifling incident to part with
Meads, maay of whom have supported
me in my work from Its very begin
ning. Indeed, whatever success I have
achieved with the Constabulary band
has been due as much to the loyal sup
port of all classes of the people here
as to any personal efforts of my own,
for no man can do his best without
the inspiration that comes from the
aid and encouragement of his fellow
men.
"It is a far cry back to that day in
October, 1902, when the Constabulary
band made Its first public appearance
In Manila. Even at that earty day I
had faith la Its*future, for I was
aware of the latent musical genius of
the Filipinos. But neither my own
efforts nor the efforts of my men could
have made the Constabulary band
what It Is today had it not been for
the loyal support we have received
from the general public.
"I shall always look back with pleas
ure to my cordial relations with the of
ficials of the Philippine government
and their generous cooperation during
the years of my service here. I feel
that I owe to them and to the people
In general a debt of gratitude that can
never be measured, because it has
been through them that I have been
enabled to realize the culminating am
bition of my llfe
"I am also deeply appreciative of the
many courtesies which have been ex
tended to me by the military authori
ties In the Philippines, and I take this
occasion to mention the fact that when
the organization of a constabulary
band was still In the projective state
it was the army that came forward
and loaned us the Instruments to be
gin our work.
"I have faith In the future of the
Constabulary baftd. XVltL its member
ship drawn from a race which pos
sesses the essential traditions and tem
perament of musicians, yvith the expe
rience gained by contact with great
musical organizations abroad and with
a competent director who is a thor
oughly trained musician, there is no
reason why the band should not pro
gress in the future as it has progressed
in the past
"If one who has received as many
favors from the public as I have may
be permitted to ask a parting favor I
would ask that my successor be given
the same generous support that has
been accorded me, to the end that he
may have a fair opportunity to prove
his fitness. Let the public remember
that any discouragement coming to
him in the early stages of his respon
sibility could easily spoil a career that
might otherwise be successful.
"In leaving the Philippine Islands I
do so with the feeling that the band
will succeed and that I will return
some day to this faraway country, not
for service, but to visit the scene of my
life work and to shake the hands of
many old friends In Manila, to whom I
shall always feel grateful.
"WALTER H. LOVING,
"Major, Philippine Constabulary, Re
tired."

(Special to Bystander.)
We, the members of the Second
Baptist church, called Rev. V. S.
Cooper of Centerville, Iowa, to take
charge of our church about five
months ago and he had been hard at
work getting us lined up or real
church work. The first thing he done
wavto start a revival, which renewed
our spiritcal strength and added forty
souls to our membership, making us
nearly 300 strong. On last Sunday,
July 9th, we had a grand rally and
raised $520.66, making a grand total
for the five months of his pastorate
of $957.69. We having raised from:
the first Sunday in last February up
to the first Sunday in July $437.13.
Rev. Cooper has proven himself to be
a giant in the gospel and a financier
of worth. We are proud of him and
feel that he will be a valuable asset
to the Baptist brotherhood in Mis
souri. Rev. Cooper is much thought
of here by all, both saints and sinners
love him because he preaches without
fear, treats all alike and he is un
compromising with sin in any form.
May God help him to enjoy good
health so he may be able to preach
long and bring more sinners to Christ.
