General Sir Douglas Haigj
Springs Surprise in Making
Attack.
LONDON WILD OVER NEWS
Russians and Germans Con-;
tinue Desperate Struggle on !
Banks of the Stokhod.
(BY ASSOCIATED PRESS!
LONDON, July 14.?At daylight
this morning the British resuming the
offensive north of the rfomrne attacked
the German second line de-1
fenses and, according to the report of1
their commander, General Sir Dougltio
ttaifr snnepederl in oenetrating [
them on a front of four miles. Press |
despatches from the front add that j
the villages of Baientln-le-Granil and
Longueval, north of Montauban, and j
the remaining portion of Trones wood
were taken by the British.
Attack Unexpected.
While it was expected the British
would not allow any great length of i
time to elapse before continuing their
operations, it was hardly believed/he 1
second German line would be at-- 1
tacked after only one day of artillery
preparation: for It was only on the 1
day before that the reported capture 1

Hardecotirt and Ovlllers took place.
iThe direction of the attack was some- 1
thing of a surprise for Instead of j
pushing on toward Combles, General j '
Halg chose to attack the (lank of the j'
Germans, who faced Contalmalson J1
and Ovlllers, and those who still oc- J
cupied I'ozieres. The advance to; j
Longueval and Razentln-le-Grnnd, If '
accomplished, gives the British pos-!'
session of other Important roads running
In various directions which have J
been a great help to the Germans In '
supplying their army directly south of !
the Ancrec river, !
London Enthusiastic.
News of the British success was re- '
ceived In London with the greatest j'
enthusiasm. It has given added j weight
to the request of the government
to workmen to forego the Aug-' '
ust holidays so that the army may!

The supplies already on hand must be j
greater than was generally believed.
else General Halg woulij, not have i |
been able to continue his offensive |
without an intermlss^n. .
There was no news this morning of f
Important developments on the west- (
prn iront out at last accounts tne
French were preparing to resume!
their offensive south of the Somnie,
while the Germans were still hammering
at the defenses of Verdun.
1'he opinion is held in France, how-,
ever, that continuation of the Somme
battle will compel the Germans to
slacken their efforts at Verdun which j
now have been in progress nearly five
months especially as the Frencli esti-;
mate the Germans lost 12,000 men
In counter attacks on Contalmalson.
Russians Checked at River.
The Russians have made no notlcetble
advance on any part of their
front since they gained the Stokhod
river where the struggle continues
desperately. The right bank apparently
has now been cleared of Germans
but H is not known here whether
the crossings made by the Russians
have given them a firm footing
on the left bank. General von
Bothiner, having received re-enforcenients,
has succeeded In holding the
Russians in Galicla, but with Delatyn
in the hands of the Russians they possess
an advantage from which further
success is expected.
Tho nnnratinnK In thp PniinasiiR are
becoming more and more Important. 1
After suffering heavy losses in the
counter offensive the Turks are now
boing pressed back toward Burbart
nnd Erzignan, while In Persia the
Russians have brought up re-enforcements
to uioet the Turks who drove
them from Kermanshali.
