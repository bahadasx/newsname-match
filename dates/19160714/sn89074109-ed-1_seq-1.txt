20 Per Cent of
Guard Rejected
No Order Received for Militiamen
to Move Toward.
Border.
liismarck, July 11.—(Spl)—No
•order has been received for the
guards to move south, though
the order for breaking camp and
preparing to entrain arrived four
days ago.
The opinion in now gaining
ground among the officers and the
r.ien that there will be no call to
go into training camp at this time
but that the troops may be kept
in readiness here at Fort Lincoln
until matters might reach a new
tead in the Mexican crisis.
May Not Be Called.
News dispatches
from
Wash-
ngton .'and Mexico City
tend to strengthen the believe
that the North Dakota national
guard will not be called out at
this time.
A new feature has been injected
into the local situation as a re
sult of'the order received from
Washington Monday to submit
£•11 the men who passed the first
"examination to another test.
20 Per Cent Rejected.
The result of this examination
•appears more disastrous to both
•officers and men than the first
one. Though no definite figures
"have as yet been given out, it is
reported that at least 20 per cent
'of the troops are being rejected.
It is rumored that a number of

BIG MAX ZIMMERMAN,
MARKET DAY BOOSTER,
ARRESTED FOR LARCENY
A number of the state press
-carry the story of the arrest at
'Crosby this week of Max Zim
merman, brother of a member of
the firm of Barret & Zimmerman,
liorse dealers of St. Paul. The
charge was grand larceny, a depu
ty sheriff of Hennepin county
.'Minnesota, making the arrest.
The story is of considerable
"local interest from the fact that
Zimmerman is well known among
Beach people as the originator of
•.the market movement, which he
staged annually in various parts
of the northwest. His first and
only appearance in connection
with a market day festiva 1 in
Beach occurred some six years
ago, and in'all fairness to Zimmer
man was considerable of a suc
cess, though the major share of
the profits thereof- is said to have
accrued to the bluff and genial
Max himself This spring he made
another visit to Beach for the pur
pose of staging another event, but
•was unsuccessful, the newly or
ganized Chamber of Commence
and by-laws effectually tieing his
hands in independent effort. The
Chamber of Commerce did not
encourage his effort, and Max de
parted for other points. Recent
ly he held a market day festival
At Williston. Other towns did not
offer much encouragement, and it
presumed his lack of success
in this respect led Max from the
straight and narrow path and re
suited in his arrest. His alleged
crime is not known here.
C. C. Crain, of Beaver Creek,
is a patient at the Beachhospital

THINK VILLA HEADS

ually leading, the bandits in their
operations in Southern Chihua
hua, according to an American
in close touch with Mexican af
fairs, who reached the border
from the state capital today.
He said that General Trevino,
commanding the government
troops in northern Mexico, has
received official ireport that be

Deutschland Will
Return in 10 Days
Captain Koeing Confident Big
Undersea Vessel Cannot
Be Held.
Baltimore, Md.. July 13.—Confi
dent that the efforts of the diplo
matic representatives of the en
tente allies to have his vessel
classed as a warship and interned
will prove unavailing, Captain
aul Koeing, master of the Ger
luan submarine Deutschland, is
preparing to leave port on his
return voyage within 10 days.
He expressed satisfaction to
night but not surprise when in
formed that three American na
val officers, who today inspect
ed the Deutschland, had reported
in effect that not only was she an
unarmed merchant vessel now
but was so constructed that she
could not be converted into a war
craft without virtually being re
built.
Designed as Freighter.
Captain Koeing said he could
only reiterate that the Deutsch
land, like other submarines built
or building for Germany's new
undersea merchant fleet, was de
signed solely as a freight carrier.
.At least eight of these vessels, it
was authoritatively 'learned here
today, now are building at Kiel.
The view here is that no such
project would have been under
taken had not the German inter
esls behind it been thoroughly in
formed that the status of the ves
sels was unquestionable.
No Torpedo Tubes.
The torpedo being a submar
ine's essential weapon to make
her effective as a war craft, it was
the possibility that the Deutsch
land might be pierced for torpe
do bolts that was the chief con
cern of the American naval offi
cers who inspected the vessel to
day.
Not only were none found but
an examination of the forward
part of the vessel's hull where
'.orpedo tubes naturally would be
located revealed that the struct
ure was not substantial enough
to contain them.

ICEWATER RIVER SWEEPS
FARGO STOREHOUSES AWAY
Fargo, N. D., July 13.—Resi
dents along the Red river valley
in this vicinity rubbed their eyes
today when several thousand
tons of ice floated down the flood
ed river under the blazing sun.
Investigation found the ice
came from wrecked storehouses
of the Fargo-Detroit Ice company,
which had collapsed when warm
water, overflowing from the river,
melted the lower layers of ice.
The river is within 2 feet 10
inches of the pring high water
mark.
Mr. and Mrs. Sam Kinsey left
Monday for St. Paul, where they
will spend several weeks visiting
with relatives and friends.

Final Report
Result Shows Deficit of but $100
as Compared With $1000
in Former Years.—No
'Surplus.
regular meeting of the execu
tive committee of the Beach
Chamber of Commerce was held
Tuesday evening, at which a full
report of the various Fourth of
July committees was rendered.
A report of the condition of the
financial affairs of the base ball
club showed a very satisfactory
condition. It is generally conced
ed that a base ball club is not a
money-making proposition A
creditable balance remains in the
fund.
With all bills pertaining to the
Beach Fourth of July celebration
in the hands of the committee, the
committee shows a final deficit
of about one hundred dollars, in
spite of rumors that it more than
paid out. It is true that some fea
tures showed a profit, but this was
more than expended in meeting
the deficit of other departments.
Iy organized handling of the
finances the celebration cost the
citizens of Reach but one hund
red dollars as compared with the
expenditures of other years of
from, one thousand to twelve
hundred dollars.
The proposition of a chautau
qun for the coming year was
temporarily laid upon the table,
pending a thorough canvass of
the Chautauqua situation. The
committee is seriously consider
ing whether or not it would be
better to run independently or on
a circuit, as has been the case in
the past. Both propositions have
their advantages and disadvant
ages, and it is for the purpose of
summarizing available data that
no definite action was taken. A
decision will be taken at a future
meeting.
South Town Re
ceives Christening
Rocky Butte Will Soon be on the
Map With Elevators, Bank,
Etc.—Work on Siding
Being Rushed.
The newest Golden Valley
town, where towns spring up as
i!' by magic overnight, is Rocky
Hutte, which received its baptis
mal christening this week.. This
does not mean that Rocky Butte
is already on the map with rail
roads, elevators and business
houses, but that it will soon be,
work at present being rushed with
all possible speed.
The grade stakes for the new
siding, which is to be twelve hun
dred feet in length, were set Mon
day by W. A. Sprague and Road
master J. F. Williamson of this
division, and J. R. Boyer is at the
head of a construction gang which
will have the rails laid by the end
of the week. The siding is being
built on land donated by J. M.
Thielen, and is ample for siding,
depot and stock yards. Mr.
Thielen already has started plat
ting the town site and though no
definite date* has yet been set, a
tormal opening will be held in
the near future. Several appli
cations for business locations
have been received, and there is
considerable talk of a new bank.
The officials of the Rocky
Hnlte Farmers' Co-Operative
Grain Co., of which W. A. Sprague
is secretary, let the contract for
a new elevator of 40,000 bushels
capacity Wednesday, and the Oc
cident Elevator Co. will likewise
construct an elevator at once. It
is expected that both will be fin
ished in time for the harvest.
Mr. Thielen, whose home is in
Aberdeen, arrived Wednesday
afternoon and set about the work
of platting at once. Farmers and
others interested in the new town
may obtain full particulars of W.
A. Sprague, /the Co-Opcrative
Grain Co's. secretary.
Pioneer Answers
The Final Call
Frank Davidson. Here in 1890,
Succumbs Following Op
eration for Appendici
tis at Dickinson
Hospital.
Frank Davidson, among the
first foremen stationed on the lo
cal section, and resident of the
Golden Valley since 1890, passed
away at the Dickinson hospital
Saturday morning following com
plications resulting from an oper
ation from appendicitis a few
days before his death.
Mr. Davidson was well known
here as one of the most interest
ing figures of pioneer days. His
story of early pioneer life from
the standpoint of a railroad man
forms an interesting chapter in the
history of this locality, when
blazing rainless summer skies
and roaring winter blizzards ef
fectually precluded the fondest
dreams of agriculture conquest
which the Valley has since
known. His passing removes an
other link connecting the arid
past with a bountiful present.
Eleven years ago, his prophe
tic vision came to the fore and he
settled on a ranch eight miles
north of Sentinel Butte, where
with his family he has since made
his home, and bent his efforts to
bringing the Valley into its own.
His demise is profoundly regret
ted.
Mr. Davidson was born in Swe
den. Being impressed at an early
ape with the lack of old country
advantages, he saved up enough
money to immigrate to this coun
try, shortly after his arrival be
ing assigned to his duties as sec
tion foreman at what is now
Reach. He leaves a widow, and
four children, John Davidson, in
the restraurant business at Sen
tinel Butte, and Lily Davidson,
Mrs. Ole Hegseth and Mrs.
Charles Waldahl, of north of
Sentinel Butte.
Funeral services were held
Monday at the Sentinel Butte Con
gregational church. Rev. Larsen,
of Taylor, officiating. The fun
eral was among the largest ever
held in that vicinity.
The All-American ladies' base
ball team will meet the Beach ag
gregation at the local base ball
park next Thursday, July 20, and
Beach fans are promised a contest
out of the ordinary. The local
boys, say we, are going to be put
at a serious disadvantage, for
which of them can withstand a
pretty smile? But we're going to
root for 'em for a' that.
The M. E. Ladies' Aid met at
the church parlors yesterday af

W.rT. Bjerke Has
Awful Experience
Five Days and Nights, in Open
With Broken Leg and
Without Food or
Water.
Alone in the open, under the
seething sun by day and the damp
chill of night, for five days and
five nights, with a broken leg and
lus body so badly bruised he was
unable to help himself was the
terrible experience of W. J. Bjer
ke. a farmer living six miles north
of Beach, following a runaway
a week ago Friday morning. Near
ly insane with his suffering, made
possible by a pain dulling delir
ium, Bjerke was finally able to
crawl from the scene of the ac
cident into a cornfield near the
Odland place, where he managed
to make a hired man at work in
t.'ie field near hear his cries for.
help, sinking into unconscious
ness with the effort.
The story of his battle against
death, alone, without food or
water during five terrible days of
suffering will never be told,
Brerke having but a hazy mem
ory of events following the day
of the accident. According to
his story, he had hitched up his
team and was hauling a load of
grain, when the team took fright
and ran away, Bjerke being
thrown to the ground where the
heavy swaying load passed over
him and crushed his leg. Just
how it happened is unknown, but
in some manner he became en
tangled under the load and was
rolled, like a fly between two
hands, his body being a mass of
bruises. The hot sun blistered
his skin, and insects which he was
unable to fight added to his mis
ery. That he survived is a mir
acle. By a last desperate effort,
made possible by pain-deadened
nerves, he was able to drag him
self to a point where he finally
attracted the attention of a man
in the field.
The wreckage was found about
a quarter of a mile from the point
where Bjerke was found. One
horse was skinned up and bruis
ed. but will recover. The dead
body of the other horse, badly de
composed, was found in the ad
jacent creek bed.
The badly injured man was
hurried to the Stough hospital,
where he is receiving the best of
care and attention. Thanks to
a splendid constitution, he stands
a good chance to recover.
Hubert Maus, of Burkey, who
since selling his store to Al Lud
\e of Minneapolis has made hit
residence in Beach, disposed of
his farm located between Golva
md Burkey Friday last. The
buyer was Rudolph Lorenz, a
brother to Richard Lorenz of this
city, and we understand he will
farm his new purchase himself.
The consideration was $40.00 per
acre, Mr. Maus retaining the crop.
Mr. Maus expects to leave on a
short vacation trip to Oregon, go
ing from there to Kenmare, where
he has a business deal which he
is considering. His future plans
are not definite, but they will
probably take him out of the
Golden Valley, which will be re
gretted.

who is an owner of city property
here, is attending the State Med
