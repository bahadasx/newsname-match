ASK l'Olt KF.Sl'HMISSIOX
OF THi: SALOOX QUESTION
A petition has been placed in circu
lation asking tho city council to call
a special election to vote on tho ques
tion of nllowlng liquor to be 8old In
original packages in North Platto. By
orlglnnl 'packages It Is meant whisky
us bottled by tho distiller and boor in
caso or keg lots In other words bcor
and whisky would not bo sold over tho
bar by individual drink.
Those who favor the rc-submlssion
of the question claim that they do so
for tho reason Hhat it has been indis
putably shoWn that since tho saloons
closed thero has been a mnterlal loss
of business to North Platto merchants,
that there are nvaro vacant houses in
town 'than at any other time in a peri
od of five years, that rents have de
creased end also a decrease in proper
ty values.
Tho personal opinion of The Tribune
editor Is that if the proposition is sub
mited to the voters it will be defeat
ed by a much larger majority than was
given at tho April election. To him
it looks as though this "original pack
ago" scheme is only a pretext, and
that if voted Into effect, would mean
the same saloon as of yore.
As to business condition, if trado is
less than it was at this tlnio last year
It is not due wholly to tho absence of
the saloons; If there Is a ten per cent
loss perhaps one per cent is duo to
tho lack of saloon but wo question
that loss. Four-fifths of tho business
men with whom wo have talked say
that the closing of the saloons has not
effected their business.
One attorney tells us that under tho
existing laws he docs not believe that
tho city council has the right to call n
special election as petitioned; and if
an attempt is made, a writ of injunc
tion (will Issue.
Should the question, however, Imj
submitted to tho people, The Trlbuno
will oppose it. and in this opposition
evidence will bo produced to show
that the ausonco of the saloon has Hot
lnJuVd general business conditions
in North Platte.

LOCALS WIX TWO FROM
EUST1S BY UK,' SCOHES
Tho ball games with Eustts Wednes
day and yestorday on tho local grounds
Mas n distinct disappointment to tho
fans, who had reason to expect good
ball. Tho former games botlwecn
theso two teams wore fast, but Eustls
has grown weakor or else North Platto
stronger, and both exhibitions wero
extremely lop-sided, North Platto win
ning Wednesday's game 13 to 2 and
yesterday's gamo 24 to G.
The game Wednesday was somowhat
of a farce, as tho scoro would Indicate,
and some of tho cpcctp.tcrs left tho
grounds boforo tho close. Justice, an
ex-stato leaguo pitchor, was pounded
all over tho Hold by the local team
for a total of thirteen hits, Ramsey so
cuming five safeties In five times up
and Kolly making a home run. Five
errors by tho visitors helped to swell
tho scoro. Walworth pitched for North
Plaltc, allowing but six hits and strik
ing out eleven men. Eustis mndc Its
two in the sixth inning, while North
Platto scored threo in tho first, one in
tho second, threo In tho fifth, four In
sixth and two In tho eighth.
In yesterday's gamo Tibbitts, tho
Eustis pitcher who performed so well
at his former appearance here, was
knocked out of the box in tho seventh
inning and Grimm substituted. Tho
lattor, however, was powerless to stay
the hitting of Jake's men, who secured
twenty-thrco safeties during the game.
Eustis took eight hits off Todenhoft.
While the gamo was uninteresting as a
wholo, thero wero a number of scn
sationnl catches In the field, nnd the
North Platto Infield stood like a Btonq
wall.
