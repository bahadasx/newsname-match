BIG CROWD WILL
lira new
-
The visiting committee of the Com
mercial club is making a determined
effort to send one of the largest
crowds in the history of the event
to the Parma-Roswell picnic which
will be held Thursday, July 20. A
special train will leave Caldwell at 11
a. m„ and will leave- Parma for the
return trip at 10 p. m. The special will
arrive at Parma in ample time for the
excursionists to eat their picnic dinner
before the afternoon program states.
The people in charge of the picnic
have arranged an elaborate program
and it is confidently predicted that
the gathering this year will be the
most successful in the history of the
event. The program includes speak
ing bv well known orators; band con
certs by the Idaho State band of Cald
well; a base ball game between Pay
ette and Caldwell of the Idaho-Oregon
league and dancing in the mammouth
open-air pavilion.
That it is the duty of every Cald
well citizen to attend the Parma-Ros
well picnic is the opinion of Dr. F. M.
Cole, chairman of the visit 1 - commit
tee. "The citizens of Parma and Ros
well are intensely loyal to Caldwell, '
declared Dr. Cole, "and once a year
we have the opportunity of showing
our appreciation in a concrete and
convincing manner. Through the self
sacrifice and energy of the residents
the Parma-Roswell picnic has become
the most successful event of its kmd
in the state. We owe it to our neigh
bors to visit them on this, their big
gest day. The program offered is var
ied and interesting and 1 am quite
ied and interesting and 1 am quite
sure that those making the trip will
not have cause to regret it. Let us
then, as loyal citizens of Caldwell
visit the loyal citizens of Parma and
Roswell with the hand of goodfellow
ship extended." ,
The Oregon Short Line has grant
ed a round trip fare of 65 cents for
the special train. All people making
the trip from this section arc urged to
board the excursion train which will
leave at 11 a. m.
REPRESENTATIVE BOND

SENATOR ELLIOTT IS MEETING
WITH ENTHUSIASM IN ALL

SAYS NORTH IDAHO IS
WITH HIM STRONG
—HOPES FOR SOUTH
French Has Lost His Nip Owing to
Past Fights With Northern Men
Elliott Pays Respects to Governor—
People Will Effect Change in State
House at First Opportunity—Alex
Has Performed Too Much for His
Own Good.
State Senator E. .E. Elliott of Ban
ners Ferry Boundary County, who
a candidate» for one of the places
the Republican ticket for Congress
,-isited Caldwell today in the interest
of his candidacy. Senator Elliott
hails from the Eighth Senatorial Dis
trict and was prominent during the
last session or the legislature. Of
recent years he has been engaged in
the promotion of a large drainage
scheme in the Kootenai Valley and
is well known as an authority on
drainage matters as well as the au
thor of the Idaho drainage codes.
He was formerly Dean of the Ag
ricultural College at the University oi
Idaho and has frequently been before
the people of Caldwell as a speaker
at farmers institutes and other gath
erings. His wide acquaintance
'
erings. His wide acquaintance
throughout the state and his location
in one of the northern counties make
him a candidate to be reckoned with
in the coming primary campaign.
Hot Shot for Alexander
Referring to the political condi
tions throughout the state as he has
observed them in the course of his
candidacy Senator Elliott said:
"Wherever 1 have gone I liave
found a determined desire on the part
of the voters to place our state in a
better light before the people of the
whole country . The gyrations and
contortions of the political mounte
bank who poses as governor of state
and evident disrepute that the whole
state has been brought into through
his abuse of power have at last reach
ed the sensibilities of the homestay
ing voter and I have confidence that
the ultimate good sense of the people
of Idaho will redeem the state trom
its present sad condition by the elec
tion of a governor who will inspire
more inspect for its best interests.
North Entitled to Representation
"There is also a sincere feeling up
north that our part of the state is en
titled to one of the representatives in
Congress this year. Without com
menting adversely on the claims of
either of the excellent gentlemen who
are now at Washington, we feel that
has

the southern part of the state has g°t"
ten more than its share. As is well
known, both U. S. Senators and both
Representatives are now from the
south and two of them are from
Boise. This is regarded as an unfair
deal since the Panhandle coujnties
constitute almost two-fifths of the
state in wealth, population and tax
paying ability and have special inter
ests and needs which are quite dif
ferent from those of the rest of the
state. 1 have been spending much of
[my time in securing the support of
the upper counties and have now
come south with the confident claim
that my own section will give me the
strongest support of any candidate, it
is true that ex-Congressman French,
ho lias been absent from the state
for some three years and who re
turned late in April just in time to
turned late in April just in time to
revive his right to residence in it,
has announced his intention of en
tering the race, Jjut the bitterness
aroused by his action in the recent
campaigns for U. S. Senator in which
he was solely responsible for the de
feat of all other northern candidates
for that office, has largely destroyed
the nopularity which he formerly en
joyed. Mr. French has always de
pended largely on the rural vote but
the that I have always been a
farmer myself and have spent my
entire life in the interest of better
farming, together with the extensive
acquaintance I have gained through
out the state through my service as
Dean of the Agricultural College of
the University cncourage me to be

lieve that this vote will naturally sup
port my candidacy. It will be the
first time that the people have had
chance to choose a farmer or any
one in any way connected with agri
culture for this important office. Tlie
other three candidates now in the
field are all lawyers.
I believ my record in the legisla
ture for the past two sessions, my
services as a member of the State
Drainage and Irrigation Commission
and my long official connection with
the agricultural interests of the state
entitle me to consideration as a can
didate and I have confidence that the
claims of the northern section for :

OCCORRED AT FARGO

section, is near death at the
Canyon County hospital as a result of
injuries received in a fight which oc
curred between the deceased and
Charles Crawford and W. H. Rose

brought to a local hospital Saturday
and for a few days seemed to be re
covering from the injuries he sustained
in the fight.
It is said that bad feeling existed
between Mr. Cross and his two neigh

found expression in a fight which re
sulted in the injury of Mr. Cross Sat

OUSTER PROCEEDINGS
STARTED MONDAY
Assessor Christopher Claims Reports
Were Made to Auditor
.
Hearing 011 the complaint of C. B. |
Ross, chairman of the board of com- :
missioners, against former Assessor | j
A. O. Christopher started before Judge I
Ed L. Bryan in district court Monday j n
morning. This is the first of the suits I ;
directed against the former official in
an attempt to oust him from his office, j j
The complaint to which Christopher
is now answering, as amended since
arguments on the demurrers last week,
charges that he violated provisions of
chapter 58 of the session laws in "wil
I fully, knowingly and corruptly" ne
! glecting and refusing to settle with the
county auditor for moneys collected
on account of taxes levied upon the
personal assessment roll, and in failing
to file reports the first Mondays of
May and June accompanying such
settlements.
Say Reports Were Filed
„ . ,
The defense early brought out the 1
claim that Christopher made the re-j
quired reports. The May report, it is J
claimed, was turned in on May 9. and j
the June report on June 10. In having!
made the report on those dates, the
defense maintains that the assessor
escaped the penalty of the status,
which fix a heavy fine for failure to
turn the reports by the 10th of the
month.
Prosecutor H. A. Griffiths on the
othej hand, is seeking to show that
the reports filed are not such as e
quired by law. It is known that
in the further hearing of the case on
Tuesday plaintiff's counsel will offer
evidence designed to support the al
legation that the reports did not ac
count for all the moneys the asses
sor had collected and had on hand in
his bank balances.

claim More Land With the Water
and System Which has Been Pro
vided for This Project—Estimated
Amount of Land That Can be Re
claimed is From 40,000 to 50,000
Acres.
The board of directors of the Boise
Water Users' association met Tues
day. The investigation made by Mr .
Trowbridge several week ago has been
completed and reported to Secretary
Lane. Mr. Lane now has the report
under consideration. This was the
gist of a letter which Secretary Girard
had received from Secretary Land.
Allegations of the water users that
J. A. Badley, while in a post of re
sponsibility with the reclamation ser
vice, permitted irregular practices
which incurred losses they will have
to bear, have twice been the subject
of investigations by men sent here
from Washington The first report,
by a Mr Smith, was seemingly "lost
in the shuffle," and all efforts to get
before the settlers the finding of the
investigator failed. This caused the
users to demand a new investigation,
a demand which was granted early in
the spring, when Secretary Lane sent
Mr. Trowbridge here as his confiden
tial investigator.
Preparing for Fight
Preparing for Fight
The cpmmittee of directors appoint
ed at the June meeting to begin the
gathering of data to be placed before
a competent legal advisor, for the
purpose of lining up the fight which
is to be made against collection of full
cost of water rights at the high figure
which will obtain merely reported
progress. Its investigations will be
continued. That it will have an
abundance of evidence with which to
enter the fight was made evident
from their statements before their
fellow directors.
A committee composed of Directors
Sparks and Johnson was appointed
to audit the books of the secretary.
An interesting development of the
meeting was the fact that former
Chairman J. W. Brandt, who had
signed for publication an affidavit to
the effect that the minutes of the June
meeting did not correctly record ac
tion of the board in expressing thanks
to the newspapers of the project for
<pd rendered allowed the minutes to
be approved as they stood, making no
effort to have them revised to coin
cide with statements of his public af
fidavit.
Project Manager D. W. Cole, who
was present at the meeting, reported
conditions at Arrowrock as excellent,
and stated that all the government ca
nals are in good shape and carrying
a maximum of water.
