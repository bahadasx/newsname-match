REPUBLICANS OF STATE
ENTHUSIASTIC MEETING
The adjourned republican state con
vention which met at Prescott on last
Thursday to finish up the business
that was started at Tucson in May,
vm ji reDetition of the former en
thusiastic body of republicans, and if
nnvtiiinn-. the events succeeding the
HilJ f HOI --. . "
Tucson convention, put more 'pep" in
to the work of carrying on the good
f All (3 A
There was a strong interest taken
by every delegato present, with a
he'arty accord to make it all unauni
mous. If there ever had been any
wide open discord, no one would have
known it by the way the different
'elements got together at this meeting
for good and nil. The main idea was
"the good of the cause" and there
was not one dissenting voice during
the whole convention. There were in
termingling of arguments and ideas,
warm and some hot, hut all for the
nlllmnln end of nroducing TCSUlts.
The convention was called to order
by Chairman R. E. Sloan when the
limir arrived, as though there had on
ly been an, intervening time of a few
nours; owing w me ui"" i-
es and those not present at the first
session, a committee on credentials
was appointed and a new committee
on resolutions, but it subsequently
appeared that even their work was
hardly necessary, for the convention
decided that each delegation could
fill the number of absentees not ac
counted for.
Since there were many candidates
for the different state offices to be
filial' 5t vns decided nofc to make any
recommendations as to who they
should be, as it would be necessary in
any event, under the present dem
ocratic primary law for all to secure
the nomination eventually at the
primaries on September 12th.
Instead of technically violating the
law as was done by the democratic
brethren, who seemed to have devel
oped a profound disgust for the medi
cine mixed "by their own fcarty, and
let the state committee do their work
when it came to delegates and nation
al committeeman, it was decided to do
only that which they were empowered
to do under the law.
Three electors for the national
ticket were nominated as follows: J.
Lorenzo Hubbell, of Ganado, Apache
county; Captain John C. Greenway,
of Cochise county; W. W. Cook of
Maricopa county. This was done by
acclimation after being recommended
by the members of a committee com
posed of representatives of each coun
ty delegation.
Resolutions were unanimously
passed for Hughes and Fairbanks and
the Chairman and Secretary instruct
ed to forward them by telegraph.
A strong resolution of appreciation
was also sent to Colonel Roosevelt for
his stand taken in national affairs and
his avowed support to Hughes and
there were cheers for the man who
was large enough to come to the front
as he has done at this time and un
der the attending circumstances.
A resolution commending prohibi
tion was also introduced and adopted.
Being a candidate for the United
States Senate, J. H. Kibbey, resigned
as chairman of the state central com
mittee and Thos. Maddock of Wil
liams, was named in his stead; this
made a vacancy in the office of secre
tary and Andrew P. Baumert of Phoe
nix was made secretary with W. C.
Foster of Phoenix as treasurer.
Owing to the unavoidable absence
of Bracey Curtis, secretary of the
convention at Tucson, the adjourned
meeting made A. H. Powers of Pres
cott, secretary of the session.
Enthusiastic speches were mado
and there was every evidence that
there was a feeling in the air which
portended a general victory for the
party this fall.
COMPANY I WELL FED WHILE
GUARDING CASA GRANDE
That the members of Company I of
the Arizona Infantry were royally en
tertained in Casa Grande, the fast
growing little border city, is evid
enced by the information brought to
this city last evening by Ted Healy,
publisher of the Casa Grande Bulle
tin. During the July 4 celebration in the
southern town the soldiers were enter
tained in a huge, shaded grove where
they were dined with all the good
things prepared by deft hands of local
housewives. Cakes, pies, salads, in
fact everything good to eat, were all
spread before the brave lads who nre
carefully guarding the border town.
The entertainment and banquet
were given in return for the faithful
vigilance which is being maintained
by the troops. Phoenix Republican.
FOREST SERVICE WORKING
ON ROAD INTO OAK CREEK
Highway Engineer 0. N. Powell,
from the District Forester's office in
Albuquerque, N. M., spent a few days
on Oak Creek last week looking over
a possible route for a forest service
road down into Oak Creek. This pro
ject has been under consideration by
the forest service for some time but
owing to the large amount of work of
this character going on in Anzona
and New Mexico this has been the
first opportunity of having an en
gineer look over the country. Accom
panied by Lew Thomas, Mr. Powell
looked over carefully the possible
route up Pump House Canyon and
from his inspection of the country has
decided that it would be very impract
icable to consider putting a road up
this canyon as there are many "box
es" which would make the road a very
costly one.
He considers that a road can be
built at about the same place as the
present road to very good advantage,
but cutting out some of the many
switch-backs and by. widening the
roadway from one-third to one half
again, and by making the turns a
minimum radius of 37 feet. A maxi
mum grade of 8 can be gotten on
this hillside with little difficulty. Also
at the top of the hill the new route
would probably turn to the cast and
strike the present Munds Parks road
below the Pump House.
Thevexact location of the new route
would not of course be finally decided
upon until the survey party had made
careful surveys of the country, which
is planned to be done this summer.
Mr. Powell was very enthusiastic
over the possibilities of a good road
into the Canyon and also over the
beauties of Oak Creek. He left on
July 8 for the Tonto Basin where
some government road work is under
way, and will return to Flagstaff the
latter part of this month.
Dan J. Cronin Would Succeed Himself
It is gradually occurring to candi
dates for county offices that the time
when the chosen shall be chosen, is
rapidly drawing near and those who
have a knowledge of the game of poli
tics are coming to the front now and
taking time by the forelock.
In this issue Dan J. Cronin, the
present County Recorder, announces
his candidacy for re-election to that
vorv important office. There has been
little or no complaint against him
during his two terms in that office and
he has always been given a clean bill
when his odlce and books have been
gone over by the state authorities.
Mr. Cronin has always been cour
teous and willing to give his assist
ance freely to all those who have had
business with his office since his en
cumbency and would undoubtedly
keep up the good record if elected
again to that place. Ho has many
friends who believe he should be re
turned to the office and he will un
doubtedly give "us republicans" a
heap of trouble in attempting to dis
lodge him.
For State Senator H. E. Campbell
One of the most important office to
be filled by the people this fall is the
office of State Senator. While it may
be abolished this fall by the voters by
the initiated law, the state senate may
have something to do with helping to
abolish and preventing many more
laws from going on the already well
filled volumes of state statutes. Sen
ator Campbell is one of the foremost
stockmen in Northern Arizona, a pio
neer in the business and well known
from one end of the state to the
other. During the past year he has
been prominently mentioned by dem
ocrats as a likely candidate for gov
ernor of the state.
Senator Campbell is fully convers
ant with the general interests of Co
conino county and his record (in the
last State Senate is one that needs no
explanation.
While we can not consistently en
dorse his special brand of politics,
there are other thing of more import
ance which need the attention of a
legislator, and Senator Campbell's
friends believe that he will most com
petantly fill the bill and care for the
interests of Coconino county, if elect
ed again to the state senate.
Auto Delivery Turns Over
Wm. Grant, deliveryman for Bab
bitt Bros, had a narrow escape Mon
day night when his light delivery
truck skidded and turned over twice
with him. The accident occurred up
on the Milton road after a rain. The
machine started skidding and turned
over twice down the grade, but luck
ily he escaped with but a few scratch
es and bruises.
SNOWBANKS WHERE II HEAT
. REGISTERS 130 DEGREES IN SUN
That this special section of Arizona
is a peculiarly wonderful country,
with more strange things, odd and
swift changes, is being .discovered
every day.
During the last month Frank Lewis
has been stationed on the top of the
Frisco Peaks as a fire lookout, at
which lofty vantage point he can
glance around and see what is going
on in four other states.
His lofty place of abode has been
discovered to be one of quick changes
and a place that will in a few years
be one of the most popular places in
the Southwest for tourists to visit.
Lewis naturally has an observing
turn of mind and he has discovered
some odd things as to climate since
he has been stationed there. It hardly
seems reasonable, but on July 3rd, he
put his thermometer out in the sun
and in a short time it registered 130

J. L. Daughcrty for Justice
J. L. Daughcrty is a candidate for

announces his candidacy this week for
the nomination on the democratic
ticket at the request of friends and
intends, since deciding to throw his

He started in cowpunching when he
came to the country and wound up a

A new flagman's house was unload
ed here last week and has been set
up at the railroad crossing on Beaver
street and the new flagman is expect
ed to commence his work of protect
ing the crossing within a short time.
It was a dangerous crossing and when

A short distance from his camp
there are snowbanks four feet deep.
In a convenient bank he has arranged
a very complete refrigerator where
he cashes his food stuff with the
assurance that the iceman is not go
ing to overlook him at any time dur
ing the summer.
Mr. Lewis enjoyed the fireworks in
Flagstaff the night of the 4th, but
since they were a little to close in, be
lieves that the fireworks at Clarkdalc
were really the best exhibition as dis
tance set them off at a better advant
age. It would seem that even the oldest
old timers had not discovered all the
strange and peculiar things ' about
this country and that there is still
plenty of room for more prospectors
with an inquiring turn of mind.

The past two years have been trying

Mr. Anderson is one of the early

No one can doubt his sturdy hon

with credit and to render justice to
those entitled to justice in every case.
His many friends can see no reason
why he should not be elected to the
place and will make a strenuous ef
fort to see that he is elected when the
smoke clears away this fall.

the old home at Athcrton, Missouri,

DIRECTORS OF NEW HOTEL
ELECTED MONDAY NIGHT
The new hotpl project is moving
along nicely according to reports from
those behind the scheme, and there
seems but little doubt it will eventu
ally be a reality. A meeting of those
interested, some thirty or more in
number, was held last Monday even
ing at the office of C. B. Wilson for
the purpose of reporting progress and
getting matters in concrete shape for
action.
The following boa-d of directors
were elected at this meeting: L. F.
Verkamp, J. D. Guthrie, George Bab
bitt, C. B. Wilson, J. W. Francis, T.
A. Slattery, O. H. John. The seven
named with A. W. Bikker, Chas.
Woolfolk and G. T. Wall added will
be the incorporators of the new hotel
company.
It was decided that a hotel with 50
rooms, to cost $100,000 be built, and
that construction work would not be
commenced until sufficient stock had
been subscribed to complete the build
ing and have it ready for occupancy.
The site 'of the hotel and plana and
specifications for the building have
not been definately decided upon as
yet, but these details will be the first
ones taken up, aside from properly
financing the deal.
At a meeting held Wednesday
evening the new board of directors
elected the following officers for the
company: L. F. Verkamp, president;
A. Bikker 1st vice-president; T. A.
Slattcry, 2nd vice-president; George
Babbitt, treasurer; O. H. John, secreV

sion, which they believe will be within
a short time.
WILL ENTERTAIN WINSLOW
AND WILLIAMS FREE
At a meeting of the Chautauqua
Board at the Citizens Bank Wednes
day evening it was decided to reduce
the price of children's season tickets
from $2.00 to $1.00, placing the tick
ets within the reach of all.
Owing to the failure of the auto
run to Winslow and to the fact that
the Winslow people had made prepa-
rations for the entertainment of
large number of visitors, it is the plan
of the committee to issue free tickets
to the Wjnslow people on the 20th
and 21st. Tickets will be distributed
through the Board of Trade.
Free tickets will also be issued to
Williams people on the above dates
and will be distributed through G. II.
Spellmeyer. Flagstaff invites her
neighbors to enjoy the two days or if
possible the whole week of the big,
entertaining Chautauqua.
All holders of season tickets will be
entitled to reserve seats without ad
ditional charge. Reservations for the
whole course may be made by pres
enting season ticket at the Babbitt
Brothers candy counter Monday, July
17. Reserve seats on single admis
sions will be ten cents extra.
An effort wil be made to have
plenty of chairs, for the reserved sec
tion, but in the event of an overflow
the next best seat will be on a bench
without a back. Make your reserva
tions early and get a good seat for
the whole course.
Tom Phelan for Justice of the Peace
E. T. Phelan, who ordinarily goes
under the title of "Tom" is a candi
date for the office of Justice of the
Peace and announces his candidacy
this week, as one who will ask the
democrats to place him on their ticket
on September 12th, on which date all
selections of candidates will be made.
"Tom" ranks with the old timers in
this section of the country and has
alwas borne the reputation for giving
the other fellow a square deal no mat
ter what happened to be his religious
or political belief, nor his color or
previous condition of servitude.
He is well and favorably known
throughout the Flagstaff precinct
which he would represent, as well as
the whole county for that matter, and
there are few, if any, enemies in the
entire section. He has been a con
sistent democrat in his political be
liefs, but with the distinct under
standing that a friend was a friend.
His friends believe he is the man
for the place and will make a strong
effort to secure the nomination for
him and endeavor to see that he is
elected.
Man F6und Dead Near Williams
T. A. Turner, an old man who has
been gathering up junk around Wil
liams, was found dead along side the
road five miles north nt WilKntno
Tuesday.
MOVEMENT STARTED TO
CONSERjEJAME SUPPLY
Flagstaff, Arizona, July 12. At a
well attended meeting held here to
night, the sportsmen of Flagstaff and
vicinity organized the Northern Ari
zona Game Protective Association. T.
E. McCulIough was elected president,
D. L. Hart vice-president, Roger
Morse treasurer, and F. D. Crable
secretary. This is the first unit of a
proposed series of similar organiza
tion to cover the entire state, and
whose objects will be to secure better
enforcement of the game laws, con
duct an educational campaign toward
a better public appreciation of our
game and fish resources, and cooper
ate with stockmen's organizations to
ward the extermination of predatory
animals.
Tonights meeting was addressed by
State Game Warden G. M. Willard,
and by Aldo Leopold of the U. S.
Forest Service, formerly secretary of
the New Mexico Game Protective
Association. Mr. Willard, who has
followed Arizona conditions for 32
years, describes the enormous de
crease which has taken place in the
game supply of the Flagstaff country,
and expressed the belief that a series
of Game Protective Associations
would be a great help to his depart
ment in enforccing the game laws,
and a great encouragement to h,v
men. Sir. Leopold outlined the ex
perience of the sportsmen of New
Mexico in the similar movement
which they started in that state last
fall, and the results already accomp
lished by the New Mexico Association.
"People disregard the game laws," he
said, "because they think it smart;
because they look on the proposition
as a sporting chance. The first func
tion of an Association is to impress
on them the fact that instead of be
ing smart, the illegal killing of game
is virtually stealing the property of
the public."
The plan was adopted of requiring
each member to pledge himself to ob
serve the game laws, on pain of ejec
tion, and to pledge his support to a
fixed platform of principles. This
platform includes the abolition of
spring shooting of ducks, the estab
lishment of an adequate system rr
J Same refuges, cooperation with stock-
a'mcn t exterminate predatory ani
als, and the support of every warden
who does his duty. A membership
fee of $1.00 per year was decided on.
From Flagstaff Mr. Willard and
Mr. Leopold will go to Springerville,
Arizona, to aid in launching a simiia
organizat'on there. "All real sports
men are in favor of the move," said
Mr. Willard, and it is only the selfish
and unscrupulous elements that will
oppose it." .
Pretcott Entertains Rojally
Many people from this section at
tended the Frontier 'Week doings at
Prescott and came home well pleased
with the amusements offered by the
enterprising hustlers of our sputhern
neighbor. There was something do
ing all the time and the biggest crowd
that ever attended their celebration
was" royally entertained. Prescott's
reputation for hospitality is more
than state wide and the people fully
deserve the reputation.
Despite the big crowd, there was
little confusion, events came off as per
schedule and on time. The people
who attended former celebrations
there say it was the biggest and best
ever held in that city.
Taddy Tin Victim Out on Bail
D. M. Roberts, one of the victims
in the Taddy Tin killing on the Indian
reservation last winter and who has
been held in jail a$ Prescott ever since
under bonds of $5,000, at last suc
ceeded in securing bail and returned
to Flagstaff Monday and left the
same day for Tuba. In speaking of
the case Roberts said he did not feel
in the least alarmed over the outcome
of the affair, but felt that he had
willingly walked into a trap set by
the legal authorities which cost him
several months in jail unjustly.
Swear to Kill U. S. Deserter
Before they returned to the front in
Mexico the twenty-three negro troop
ers of the Tenth who were taken pris
oners at Carrizal took an oath tonight
that they will hunt down and kill an
American deserter of the Twentieth
infantry who commanded the Carran-
za troops at Carrizal which killed
Captain Boyd and Lieutenant Adair
and so many of the negros' own com
rades. The man was a former mem
ber of the Twentieth infantry at Co
lumbus, he told the negroes, and said
Lhe was getting $5 a day gold and all
the loot he wanted as a Carranza cap-,
tain.
