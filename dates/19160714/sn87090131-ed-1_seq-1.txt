THE BLOOD OF THE BOATSWAIN.
The story of John Thomas has been I
a favorite in the forecastles of British I
ships for a hundred and fifty years, so I
it naturally has developed numerous
versions, and no man can say which i
is the correct one. A few facts touch
ing the strange adventures of John are I
of official record, showing that the
story has a foundation of truth; but I
most of the details are tradition. One
weak point is common to all the ver
sions. The hero of the story was
hanged for murdering the boatswain,
although the body of the boatswain I
was not found, which is in conflict with
British law; yet this weak point is the 1
one part of the story that has the I
strongest backing of official record.
It was the day before Christmas. in I
one of the latter years of the eight- 1
eenth century, when John Thomas, a
sailmaker, set forth to visit his moth
er. who lived near Deal. Reaching I
that town in the evening, he was too I
tired to finish his journey that night, t
so he put up at an inn presided over i
by a businesslike landlady, who in- 1
formed him that the house was crowd
ed by reason of the Yuletide festivi- t
ties, and he couldn't be accommodated
unless he was willing to share room 1
and bed with her uncle, who was the
"He Found to His Astonishment That the Boatswain Was Not There. But
the Bed Clothing Was Stained With His Blood and There Was Blood
on the Floor."
on the Floor."
boatswain oft a large ship just arrived
from India.
John agreed to this arrangement
without hesitation, and, after stowing
away a good supper and quaffing a few
flagons of brown October ale, he was
shown to the room, where he found
the elderly boatswain already in bed.
The sailmaker disrobed, blew out the
candle, and climbed into the downy
couch. He found the boatswain a
wretched bedfellow. The old man
groaned and ground his teeth as
though troubled with an ingrowing
conscience, and the way he kicked
with his feet and clawed with his
hands was a sin and a shame.
After standing it for a while, the
sailmaker concluded to take a walk,
thinking that the old man might be
quieted down by the time he returned.
It was late at night, and the inmates
of the tavern were in bed, so John tip
toed quietly to the back doer, only to
And that he couldn't open it with his
fingers. He remembered that he had
seen the boatswain's knife on the win
dow ledge in the room, so he stole
back and secured it. With this he was
able to lift the latch of the door. He
stepped forth into the cool, refreshing
night and enjoyed a good walk.
Returning quietly to his room, he
found to his astonishment that the
boatswain was not there. But the bed
clothing was stained with his blood,
and there was blood on the floor, on
the door, almost everywhere. He was
scared stiff, and followed his first im
pulse, which was to fly. Securing his
bundle, he left the inn, and walked to
his mother's home.
There he was arrested the day after
Christmas. The boatswain's knife was
in his pocket, and his story sounded
improbable. Save for the absence of
the victim's body, there never was a
stronger case of circumstantial evi
dence against a man. It was so strong I
that John was promptly tried and con
victed of murder. It was shown that
the bloodstains had been traced from
the bedroom down to the beach, and
it seemed certain that the murderer
had carried or dragged the body of his
victim there, and thrown it into the
water. In those days men were hanged
for stealing spoons, and the only thing
to do was to hang John Thomas, even
if his victim could not be found.
It happened that a new executioner
had just been inaugurated in that dis
trict, and John was his first patient.
He probably was overcome by stage
fright, for he bungled the Job. He
gave John too much rope, so that his
toes rested on the ground, and when
he was cut down it was found that he
still lived. Friends and sympathizers
smuggled the body away and revived
him. Kept in close concealment, he
soon recovered from the shock, and
was as good a man as ever.
Then, under an assumed name, he
went down to Portsmouth, where he
secured a job on a warship that was
about to sail for the West Indies.
There he remained for three years,
and distinguished himself for dill
gence, valor and sundry other admi
rable qualities, so that he was promot
ed to the position of master's mate,
and was generally liked and respected
aboard ship as well as on land.
At the end of the three years he re
turned home and drew his pay. Then,
after visiting his aged mother, and
I leaving her a little roll of real money,
he at once embarked upon another
ship that was about to sail for foreign
parts. As he lounged about the deck,
waiting for the vessel to get a move on
her, he saw an old mariner whose face
was strangely familiar. He knew he
had seen that ancient, wind-bitten
countenance somewhere, but where?
He puzzled over it a long time, and
suddenly illumination came. Laying
an agitated hand on the ancient mar
iner's shoulder, he cried:
"Didn't you sleep at the Boar's Head
inn at Deal on the night before Christ
mas, four years ago?"
"Ay, marry," quoth the ancient mari
ner. "Shiver my timbers and bust'my
binnacle toplights, or words to that
effect, if I ever forget that night."
The ancient mariner was glad to tell
his story. He had been trying to tell
it for years, and nobody would listen
to him, and here was a young man whc
really seemed impatient to hear the
facts.
Before going to the inn that evening
the boatswain had been to a surgeon.
who extracted a quantity of blood from
him. He was weak and sick when he
went to bed, and fell into a troubled
sleep, which accounted for his thrash
ing around so much. IIe had a faint
recollection of a stranger climbing
into bed with him, and also vaguely
remembered the departure of the
stranger during the night. Then he
awoke to find that the wound made
by the surgeon had broken open, and
he was bleeding profusely. Fearing
that he would bleed to death, he has
tily donned his clothes, and set forth
from the inn, hoping to find the sur
geon, but no sooner had he set foot
in the street than he was seized by a
press gang and carried away to the
beach, where a man-of-war's boat was
waiting. In this he was conveyed to
the ship, and sailed away to the East
Indies, where he had been ever since,
little dreaming that his abrupt depart
ure had imperiled a human life.
Here the chronicle ends. The sail
maker and the boatswain step out of
history as abruptly as they stepped in,
and even the fate of the buxom land
lady is shrouded in mystery.

The English soldier on furlough from
the front was pressed for reminis
cences of France.
"Well, sir, the biggest shock I got
over there was going to the firing line
first time. Who should I see but
Rooney-d'ye mind old dot-an-carry
one, who used to be on this beat?
There he was, as large as life, in the
military police. 'Jim, me lad,' sez he,
'I've pinched you a few times at home
for scrapping, but, Lord save us, I11
have to shoot you here if you don't
scrap, so keep up your reputation!'
It's a rummy world."
Worse Still.
"I saw you stepping around the city
last night, Jagaby."
"Er-yes. I was out a little while.
Did my-er-feet interfere?"
"No, indeed. In fact, you seemed
determined not to let your right foot
know what your left foot was doing."
