Sunday rest, officers declare and it
is expected that the range country
north of Fort Bliss will be covered
with regiments of national guard dril
ling and participating in battle prac
tices. The militiamen will also be
sent to the rifle ranges soon to bring
up their marksmanship to the regular
army standard. The guardsmen are
being permitted time in which to be
come accustomed to the climate, the
altitude and the change tn living con
ditions before they start hard work
in the field. Drilling by companies
has already started and a number of
the paved streets in Richmond Ter
race and other parts of El Paso near
the fort are being used for these drills.
Ao Hope of Fighting.
A majority of the militia officers
and men have given np hope of see
ing action while they are bn the border
and they are settling themselves to a
summer of routine drills, camp life ani
patrollimr. When the militia first ar
rived they were keen for action but.
since they have been in camp and hat 3
had a chance to learn the situation on
the border at first hand, they have
abandoned their zeal for fighting to
that of apathy and a desire to have
as good a time while they are on tha
border as possible.
Look Like Itegnlarx.
The militiamen are beginning to show
the effects of their camp life and their
contact with the regular army soldier
and officers. They appear neater when
they come downtown on shore leave.
The militiamen have learned hw to
lace their canvas leaeinu so that ihev
will look trim and neat arnui.d th

Fighting at Parral.
Recruiting for Villa throughout cen
tral Chihuahua is bringing many Mex
icans into the bandit chiefs service,
and the Villista movement is assum
ing formidable proportions, according
to an arrival from south of Chihuahua
City. Because of a very general sym
pathy of the common people for Villa
throughout that section, said the in
formant, the rebels were in few in
stances forced to conscript those 'whom
they wished to enlist with their fight
ing men.
In that part of Mexico there is no
longer any doubt that Francisco Villa
is himself at the head of the movement,
according to this information. Per
sons who assert they are well ac
quainted with Villa through previous
association claim to have seen him in
the past few days with his troops.
Santa Ifoaalla Expect Attack.
The battle at Parral lasted two days
and was hotly contested without deci
sive termination, the informant said
Santa Rosalia was in momentary ex
pectation of being attacked by ViUistas
