Persistent Rumor De Facto
Ojinaga Garrison Disloyal.
El Paso, Tex., July 14. Villa has
demanded the surrender of Chihuahua
City, according to a well founded but
unofficial report here today. Gen.
George Bell. Jr., commander at Fort
Bliss, stated that he received reliable
information of the defection of Gen
eral Trevino, commandant in Chihua
hua City, from the Carranza govern
ment. -
Hell had also heard the reports or
Villa's demand for the surrender of
the Chihuahua capital but had not re
ceived confirmation Villa is said to
have informed Trevino that if the city
was not turned over to the Villistas
they would advance against the capital
with their entire army. Villa threat
ened Trevino and all his officers with
death in case of capture, according to
the rumor. General Bell would not
discuss the possibility that Trevino s
reported defection meant the surren
der of Chihuahua City to Villa.
Let I'nited Slates Supplies Pass.
Trevino today revoked his order to
retain railroad shipment of supplies
through Juarez to the American ex
pedition in Mexico. A train of twenty
one cars of provisions was allowed to
so to Colonia Dulilan. Trevino Rave
no explanation of his previous orders
which led to charges that his policy
was In keeping with the new Villista
movement to bring on war with the
United States and overthrow Carranza
in northern Mexico.
This is the "grave news" declared
on the best authority to have been
transmitted to Washington and reflect
ed in the large concentration of na
tional guards here. With the arrival
of 500 Massachusetts recruits from
Framingham- today there were 24.000
national guardsmen in the El Paso
district. Other state contingents or
dered to El Paso will bring the total
to 50.000, it if believed.
Former Villistas are under close
surveillance. Steps have been taken
to prevent smuggling of arms and am
munition across the Big Bend border.
General Bell said today more militia
probably would be moved there
shortly.
Garrison 700 Ready to Join Villa.
San Antonio, Tex., July 14. Re
ports have been received by army of
ficers here that the Carranza garrison
at Ojinaja. numbering 700 men, is dis
loyal to the de facto government. This
information is understood to have
been- one of the factors in General
Funston's reinforcement of the Ameri
can troops in the Big Bend country,
following reports that a large band of
Villistas was headed in that direction.
The presence of Villistas in that
vicinity, it is said, would provide the
Ojinaga garrison an opportunity to re
volt and join the bandits, leaving the
border practically unprotected from
the Mexican side.

Kansas-s greatest crop year. That
was the prediction for this state today
by William M. Hirschy of Chicago, who
has just made a two weeks' study of
conditions. Hirschy today told J. C.
Mohler, secretary of the state board of
agriculture, that the 1916 wheat crop
in Kansas would exceed the 1915 yield,
that with favorable weather the state
would gather its greatest corn crop
and that farmers had saved every
pound of their big alfalfa crop.
Hirschy has visited all of the big
wheat producing counties in the state.
He is the crop expert for a large Chi
cago grain firm and on his Judgment
of conditions, his firm each year spec
ulates thousands of dollars. For four
teen years Hirschy has been in touch
with conditions in Kansas. For
four years he has made close personal
studies of crop conditions here. To
day he told the secretary of the state
board of agriculture that with favor
able weather conditions Kansas would
break some records.
"Kansas will have more wheat to
sell this year than last year," Hirschy
declared. "By that I don't mean the
crop is larger than last year. I mean
the farmers will save more erain. My
guess is that the crop will thresh be
tween 100 and 110 million bushels.
Probably 105 million bushels will be
about the final record. What is more,
the quality is the best the state ever
produced. I have not seen a field of
grain where the crop has tested less
than fifty-nine pounds to the bushel.
Less Abandoned Land.
"This year there is less abandoned
lan ..than-in -1JU 5.. Waaiher condi
tions' for harvesting have been nearly
perfect. There have been no floods
and nearly every bushel of grain
raised by the farmers will be saved.
"Your corn is two weeks behind.
That's an act of Providence this year.
The hot weather hasn't hurt ' it. In
fact, the corn could not be in better
condition. Only in Saline county and
in a strip of territory along the Kaw
river has the corn begun to tassle. The
corn will stand another week or ten
days of warm weather without suffer
ing eliminating of course the possi
bility of hot winds. Then with a good
general rain, look out. You will have
a wonderful yield.
"Alfalfa has made a wonderful
showing and the farmers have saved"
every pound of it. There have been
no bad rains or floods to interfere with
the cutting and the state ought to
break a few records this year."
Hirschy anticipates thtt Kansas
farmers will encounter no material
slump in markets next fall.
"Prices will probaDly remain as
high as at present and may go high
er." the Chicago man predicted.
The report of Secretary Mohler for
1915 showed the value of Kansas field
crops for the year to have totaled
$341,561,439. The report estimated
the 95,768.176 bushel wheat yield at
$S5. 681,787. The 142,553,140 bushel
corn crop was valued at $73,547,444,
while the 34.304.085 bushel oat crop
was valued at $13,037,890. A crop of
4,647.07 8 tons of alfalfa was valued
by Mohler at $28,433,930.
WHERE MONEY GOES
Nogales, Ariz., July 14. Another
revolutionary plot set on foot by Felix
Diaz to clause the overthrow of the
Carranza government in Sonora was
revealed today, in the United States
district court, when Colonel Alejandro
Barron was held on a charge of start
ing a military expedition into Mexico.
Only sufficient evidence to hold Bar
ron was introduced by the govern- i
ment.
Ramifications of the proposed ex
pedition extended through half a do?.- j
en border towns and called for set
ting up a new revolutionary govern
ment in Sonora, which would em
brace other Mexican states.
A number of high military officers
were implicated in the plot to over
throw Carranza's domination of the
state.
The dispatch lends additional color
to the suspicion that General Felix
Diaz passed through Topeka one
week ago on a secret overland trip, in
an automobile.
A Spanish speaking man, answering
:n many respects the description of
Diaz and signing his name John F.
Diaz, stayed all night at the National
hotel Friday, July 7. He was ac
companied by two other men register
ing from Buenos Aires. Argentine Re
public. They were driven by an Amer
ican chauffeur who told a Washburn
student here- a wild tale of an over
land itinerary from Indiana covering
all the principal military stations en
route. He told of copious notes taken
on the equipment of the forts and
elaborate maps being made.
The chauffeur gave it as his opin
ion that his employer was Felix Diaz.
He had mentioned his suspicions to
the commander of an Iowa fort, and
the officer had the men privately
"shadowed." They were not detained,
however, and continued on their way.
Diaz was bound for San Diego osten
sibly, according to the chauffeur, and
he had been instructed to take an ex
treme southern route. They were trav
eling at the rate of 300 miles a day,
according to the chauffeur's story,
which sh uld have gotten the party
easily as far as Nogales by this time.
An Estate Is Slowly Eaten Up by
Court Costs.
When Carl Robinson's father died
about six years ago he left the boy
about $240 in cash to be held by a
guardian or administrator until the
boy became of age. John Schenck
was named and has been serving m
that capacity.
Mr. Schenck has not touched the
m ney. The boy has not had a cent
of it. No one has had any use of it.
Yet the total has been reduced to $186
and it will be three years more before
the boy can touch it.
Each year Mr. Schenck has been re
quired to put up a $2,000 bond at a
cost of $10 annually, the money of
course to be taken from the "estate"
in his hands. Each year he must file
a report with the probate judge at a
cost of $4 or $5. Each year he must
give it in for taxes and in Topeka they
amount to between $3 and $4.
All in all the drain on the little in
heritance amounts to about $20 a
year. That has been going on for six
years and there are three vears to go.
"It's a good thing, under existing
laws," said John Schenck, "that the
boy wasn't a baby when his father
died. If he had been he would have
been in debt by the time he reached
his majority."

STRIKE STRONGEST POSITION
Fierce Battle Waged Northeast
of Albert.
French Left Wing Makes a
Simultaneous Advance.
BY ED L. KFKV.
London, July 14. British troops
broke the German line on a four-mile
front at dawn today with a smashing
blow that swept the British lines into
the villages of Longueval and Bazen-tin-Le-Grand
and cleared the Trones
wood, an advance of more than a
mile. The gain is the greatest scored
for the Anglo-French offensive since
the opening of the great assault thir
teen days ago.
"At dawn we attacked the enemy's
second system of defense," said an
official bulletin from General Haig
given at 11 a. m. "We broke in hos
tile positions on a four-mile front,
capturing several strongly defended
localities. Heavy fighting continues."
Special dispatches from press head
quarters at the front announced the
capture of Longueval, Bazentin-Le-Grand
and the clearing of the Trones
wood in the early hours of the fight
ing. The blow was struck at the verv
sector of the battle front where the
Germans had assembled their heaviest
bodies of reinforcements. The early
bulletins, though very meager, indi
cated that one of the greatest battles
or tne allied offensive la being waged
in the wooded region northeast of
Albert.
British Move Toward Bapaume.
The British advance apparently was
in the direction of Martinpuch heights
and the plateau dominating the road
leading to Bapaume, the immediate
objective of the British attack. The
village of Longueval lies at the Inter
section ot tne Hapaume-Bray and Al-bert-Combles
highways and but seven
miles oa.thwest,af jBapaume. - 3aaen-tiri-Le-Grand
lies immediately east of
Contalmaison, whose capture by the
British was admitted at Berlin yes
terday, and slightly northwest of
Trones wood.
The French left wing pushed for
ward at the same time, according to
an unofficial report from Paris,
straightening the French lines be
tween Hardecourt and Guillemont and
threatening the village of Mturepas.
A dispatch filed at Paris at mid
night reported that the British had
pushed clear to Memetz wood, where
desperate fighting has been going on,
and were but 500 yards from the vil
lage. The remaining distance was
covered with a rush when the offen
sive was resumed at daybreak.
The German position at Posieres, on
the Bapaume highway, has been ren
dered extremely critical by the British
advance, Paris reported.

London, July 14. Following the

, treasury bills at the Bank of England
'to per cent for three months bills,
j 5 per cent for six months and 6 per
jcent for twelve months. No quotation

New York, July 14. Four persons,
including one woman and a boy, were
shot and painfully though not serious
ly wounded when a charge of buck
shot spattered the observation plat
form of the car near Pitcairn, attached
to the Pennsylvania railroad's crack
Chicago-New York train, the Broad
way Limited, near Maples, Ind.
The train arrived in New York on
time at 9:40 today, when Pullman
Conductor Walsh made his report to
the road officials.
The wounded are:
R. J. Woods, stenographer to the
general freight agent of the Pennsyl
vania at Pittsburg.
H. P. Gillette, 50 Williams street.
New York.
Master Keifer Newman, 4433 St.
Charles avenue. New Orleans.
Miss Bertha Gossweiler, maid with
the Newman party.
Eight shot penetrated the screen
door of the observation car. Frag
ments of shot were picked up from the
floor by one of the train employes and
will be turned over to the officials in
Chicago.
Saw Gang Sitting on Fence.
There was no suggestion of a holdup
in the report of the conductor, and
early reports that the shots were fired
after an attempt to stop the train,
were denied by officials. The train
was passing between Maples and Mon
roeville, Ind., when fired on. The con
ductor said some men or boys were
sitting on a fence. As the train
passed them there was a shot and
the passengers on the platform were
struck in the arms and legs. Gillette
is said to have declared that he saw
the gun leveled at the train as it sped
by. Then came the report of the
gun and the startled cries of the
passengers as they were hit. Six shot
struck Wood in the right leg and two
in the left leg below the knee. Young
Newman suffered a flesh wound in
the lag. Gillette was slightly wounded
in the thigh: Miss Gossweiler was
struck in one arm and one leg.
A telegram was sent ahead to Lima.
Ohio, informing the railroad officials
after the shooting, and Dr. J. B. Vail
boarded the train there. He pro
nounced the wounds of all of the vic
tims superficial and they continued
, their journey.

President Wilson Names Him
for Supreme Court. '
Appointment Sent to Senate To
day for Confirmation.
Washington, July 14. The nomina
tion of John H. Clarke, of Ohio, for
associate Justice of the supreme court
to succeed Charles Evans Hughes was
sent to the senate this afternoon by
President Wilson.
John H. Clarke, who has been se
lected by President Wilson to succeed
Charles E. Hughes as associate Jus
tice of the United States supreme
court, is 59 years old and a bachelor.
The only political office he ever held
was the United States district Judge
ship in the Cleveland court to which
he was elevated two years ago by
President Wilson. However, Judge
Clarke has long been a leader in the
Democratic party in this city and state.
He was several times a candidate for
United States senator. His campaign
two years ago was halted by his ap
pointment to the federal bench.
Judge Clarke was born at Lisbon,
Ohio, September 18, 1857, attended
the Western Reserve university here,
was graduated in 1877, and two years
later moved to Youngstown, where he
practiced law until his removal to
Cleveland in 1897. After coming to
Cleveland Judge Clarke was for a
number of years chief counsel to the
Nickel Plate railroad. He is financial
ly interested in the Youngstown Vindi
cator and has has always manifested a
deep interest in public affairs.
Ran Against Mark Hanna.
In politics he has been a lifelong
Democrat and ran against Mark
Hanna for the United States senate in
1903. A sketch of his life given out
at the White House today says:
"He has been conspicuous in pro
gressive movements in Ohio and in the
nation at large" and "is probably the
most gifted orator in Ohio." Since
becoming district Judge in Cleveland
he has taken especial interest in the
naturalization and Americanization of
foreign born citizens.
Particular attention is directed in
the White House sketch to the fact
that, despite his services as general
counsel for a railroad before going on
the bench. Judge Clark, in his cam
paign for the senate, advocated a two
cent, passenger rate law.
In Cleveland, Judge Clark for a long
time was assocated in politics with
the late Tom Johnson and Secretary
Baker.
The appointment of Judge Clarke,
following the resignation of Mr.
Hughes leaves New York state without
representation on the supreme court.
The political complexion of the
court is not changed, a majority re
maining Republican.
The president confidentitlly ex
pects that Judge Clarke will be con
firmed during the present session of
congress. . .

Washington, July 14. The United

tons was reported in distress forty
five miles south by east of the
Charleston Lightship, according to a
radiogram to the coast guard service.
A gale was reported raging at that
point.
Holdings in Wyandotte, Leav
enworth and Douglas.
The Heim interurban line, officially
known as the Kansas City, Kaw Val
ley &, Western, will come from Law
rence to Topeka on the south side 'Of
the Kaw river. This much discussed
point appears to be settled definitely
in a big mortgage recorded in Shawnee
county by the officers of the com
pany. The mortgage, recorded by Ralph
Squires, register of deeds, is for $S12,
500 and covers all the property the
company now owns or may own in
Wyandotte, Leavenworth, Douglas and
Shawnee counties. It does not dis
close any property r ow owned by the
company in Shawnee county but does
outline the route of the interurban
from Kansas City to Topeka.
The route as far as Lawrence is
known, the line that far being in oper
ation at present. Two routes from
Lawrence to Topeka have been sug
gested, one north of the river and the
other south. The mortgage follows
the line to North Lawrence, then
starts "across the Kaw river" into
Lawrence and on in a generally west
ern direction to and into the city of
Topeka.
Xo Exact Route.
The mortgage does not show any
right-of-way secured in Shawnee
county. There has been much specu
lation about the use of th-2 old Vine
wood park line into Topeka but the
mortgage makes no reference to that
and does not indicate that the Heim
interests have fixed upon the exact
route into Topeka.
The mortgage is in printed form,
like a lawyer's brief. It contains over
15,000 words and the recording fee in
Shawnee county was $15. Copies of
the mortgage were filed in Wyandotte,
Leavenworth and Douglas counties
and under the state law the filing
would be approximately the same in
each county.
The signatures of J. D. Waters,
president, and K. D. Klemm, secre
tary, are attached to the mortgage.
The mortgage is to the Commerce
Trust company of Kansas City, Mo.

Report of Row Among Tope
kans From Eagle Fass.
Adjt. Gen. C. I. Martin denied em
phatically a report from Eagle Pass
to the effect that he had been request
ed to make a change in the personnel
of three commissioned officers of Bat
tery A.
"That is false," declared General
Martin this morning. "I have not re
ceived any request of that nature and
don't contemplate any charges."
General Martin stated that it is his
understanding that changes in the
personnel of commissioned officers
could only be made upon the findings
of an efficiency board or by court-
martial.
"New "provisions for such changes
are embodied in the new federal de
fense act," said General Martin. "I
have had no changes under contem
plation and cannot statv definitely at
this time just what methods are pur
sued in changing commissioned offi
cers after they are mustered into the
federal service."
Would Remove Hite.
According to the report which
reached Topeka, non-commissioned
officers have asked General Martin to
relieve Captain Hite of command of
the battery and appoint William H.
Brady, inspector instructor, a reg
ular army non-commissioned of
ficer, commander. The report goes
farther and declares the men wish
Lieut. James Hughes transferred to
another command and that wire pull
ing for this change is under way in
Topeka at this time.
To succeed Hughes, Second Lieut.
Richard Porter would be advanced to
first lieutenant and Sergt. Frank Wil
son to second lieutenant, according to
the report.
Hughes Orders an Arrest.
Camp Shatter, Eagle Pass, Tex.,
July 14. Placing Battery A as a unit
of the Third Field artillery under real
army officers may result in settling a
row existing between commissioned
and non-commissioned officers of the
Topeka battery. The row came to a
head Thursday when Chief Mechanic
James Whittaker was placed under
arrest upon order of Lieut. JImmie
Hughes for refusing to give him the
I ordnance keys for one of the sections.
Whittaker was acting under orders of
Lieut. William MacLean, senior first
lieutenant, who had instructed him to
give the keys to no one.
j When MacLean heard of Whitta
; ker's arrest he placed a few bomb
j shells under Hughes, informing the
; latter that his orders to Whittaker
j should stand over those of Hughes,
I junior first lieutenant. Capt. John M.
jHite ordered Whittaker released from
ine guara nouse and congratulated
him for obeying orders of the senior
first lieutenant.
Following this mix-up, it is report
ed that First Sergt. Frank Wilson in
formed Captain Hite that he would
give up his job at any time. Wilson
at one time was a commissioned offi
cer in Battery A.
Following a conference of Kansas
and Missouri health officials, bulle
tins were today issued by boards 'if
health of both states directing a cam
paign for the protection of children
against infantile paralysis. The bulle
tin urges that all cities and towns
immediately direct general cloan-up
crusades and that the campaign for
sanitary conditions be extended to a
general fly swatting and killing of
germ carrying insects.
-n urging a quarantine against all
persons suffering from the diseaye,
the health officials advised that th
quarantine be made general auainst
all members of a household where
the disease has been found and in
clude all persons who have betn ex
posed. The bulletin admits that no
known medicine or serum can be
administered as a preventive. For
that reason the greatest cleanliness is
urged. Parents are also asked to
keep children from public places
where crowds gather and to watch
most carefully the preparation of
food for children.
The health officials in their bulletin
discuss symptoms of the disease and
urge the immediate calling of a physi
cian when any of thse symptoms are
indicated in a child. A special com
mittee of physicians from the two
states was appointed to direct a cam-
paign against the disease. Members
of this committee are: Dr. 8. J. Crum
j bine, secretary Kansas state board of
j health. Topeka; Dr. C. W. McLaughlin,
health commissioner, Kansas City,
, Kan.; Dr. J. -A- B. Adcoek, secretary
I Missouri board of health, Jefferson-
(.aiy ; jjr.-,.:inomas Miner, acting
swpernrtBndent-SHJspitmle, Kansas Cityt
Mo.; Dr. H. E. Pearse, health service,
Kansas City, Mo. .
Recommendations? ,
The committee made the following
recommendations:
First Physicians should report !m-
merlintplv nil ia(H ny . Rnunnrinil
j cases of poliomyelitis to their local
; health boards and local health boards
' should immediately telegraph reports
to their respective state boards of
health.
Second Immediate quarantine of
all in any way exposed to the disease.
Third It is probably safer for the
children to remain at home, where
parents will have better supervision
of their food supply and can take
better care of them than to hurry
away to the mountains and country
districts.
Fourth No known medicines or se-
rums are effective against the dis
j ease. People should refrain, there
fore, from "doping1' their children.
Fifth Children should be kept
away from -crowds or strangers.
Sixth Parents should consult a
reputable physician in the event of
any unusual illness of their children.
Seventh The mayor and council
of every city and the county board of
health of every county in Missouri and
Kansas set about immediate city and
f county clean-ups, with special refer
1 ence to the unsanitary outside toilet
j and strongly urge that every outside
t toilet be made fly-proof,
j Finally, the commission- recom
i mends that the people remain calm,
j being assured that the health authori
ties are mim to cope wiui any situa
tion which may arise.
The Symptoms.
The following are some of the
symptoms:
First The " disease may develop
with symptoms of an ordinary cold in
the head, or bronchitis, or sore
throat, or disturbance of the stom
ach or intestines, or as an ordinary
attack of grip. Occasionally with
vomitiner. In all such cases a doctor
should be called at once for diagnosis.
Second Spinal irritability with
; a desire not to be touched or moved,
' and complaining when the legs or
j spinal column aro moved.
J Third Fever to a moderate degree
. is usually present.
j Fourth The virus generally enters
the system through the nose or
; throat.
Fifth Flies, bedbugs, or any blood
. sucking insect may be carriers of the
! disease.
