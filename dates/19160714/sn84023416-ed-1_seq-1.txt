The Congregational Sunday school
started Tuesday morning on their
annual picnic under cloudy and
threatening skies and many foretold
rain while others, more optimistic,
prophesied a fair day. The picnic
was held at Warner's grove and the
usual large number were in attend
ance, over one hundred finding their
way to the grove by automobiles,
boats and teams. The day turned
out to be meai, iair, warm, witn a
a little breeze to temper the heat,
and as usual when the day was over
it was decided to have been the best
ever. A number of fancy races
were indulged in by both girl? and
boys and the various prizes awarded
were choice and unique and no doubt
will be handed down with rare pride
to posterity. The baseball games,
two being played were of much in
terest to the spectators and umpires
on account of the many star plays
and ragged decisions. The after
noon ball game resulted in a victory
for the White Tops with a score of
14 runs more or less to the Red Tops
12. Much interest and perspiration
was created by the Volley ball
teams. In the excitement of the
game the score was forgotten. It
was a great time and unspoiled by
any accident. We are all planning
to be there next year f rom the babies
to the octogenarians. Much credit
is due to Mr. Morong for the sue
cess of the sports. The prize win
ners were as follows: -Coat and hat
race, Clifford Stevens, Duncan Mac
MacKenzie. Wheelbarrow race,
Clifford Stevens; driver, Alex King,
Timothy Dale; driver, Claude Foster.
Race of children under eight, Fre
man Danforth, Doris Humphrey.
Boys' race, eight to twelve, Clarence
Wilson, Clarence Corliss. Girls'
race, eight to twelve, Celia Perry
Marjory Wilson. Older .girls' race,
Louise Lawton, Rachel Renell.
Cracker and bottle race, Duncan
MacKenzie, Mary Strohe. Shoe
race, Robert C. Lawton, Clayton
Lindsay.
Card of Thanks
We desire to extend thanks to
those who by kind acta and words
helped to lighten the burden during

preciation. May Heaven's richest
blessing be yours.
