of the Somme river, the British infantry was sent forward at

A terrific attack succeeded in breaking through- the Ger
man second lines at many points.' '.

London. Julv 14 Several
piken in' fne-new' British drive on the German second lines at! -lAwn
today, say the official statement issued at noon. Thai,
statement follows: .t .
"This morning at dawn we
on a front of. four miles and have
fended localities. -Heavy fighting continues."
' ' ;Reulers correspondent at the British front telegraphs the
British forces have captured Bazentin-Le-Petit and most of ,
the village of Ovillers,
' The Britten advance reported in to
day's official despatches ' apparently
constitutes .the second phase of the
great , Anglo-French offensive In the
neighborhood of the 'Comma river
Which bean on July 1 over a front
of something more than 20 miles. The
first phase of this offensive carried the
British i forward ..to and gave them
possession ;of Contalmaisofci. and MOn
tauban tut the French on their right
moved- their lines further forward. .
The ' reported capture 'of Longueval
and .Bexantln-Le-Grand Indicates- that
the British, in- today's assault advanc
ed eastward northward from Contal
maieon or Montauban and that they
apparently have-brought their right
wing on a par with 'the French left
and are thrusting a salient between
Peronne. the immediate French ob
jective and : Bapaume, . the point at
which th British movement is report
ed to be directed.
- - Longueval is about three and a half
miles east of Contalmaison and Be-
zantih-Le -Grand is midway . netween
those towns.. v
i While -it is expected the British
would not -allow any great length of
time to elapse before continuing their
operations, it was hardly believed the
second German line would be attacked
after one day of artillery preparation;
for it was only on the day pefore" yes
terday that they completed capture of
the first line in the region between
Hardecourt and Ovillers. .
The direction of the attack, too, was
something of a surprise, for instead of
pushing oh toward Coublea, . General
Hal chose to attack the flank of v the
Germans who faced Contalmaison and
Ovillers .and those who . still occupy
PoisslBra. - . " ' ,
- News of the British success has giv
en added weight here to the request
of the government workmen to forego
the August holidays so that the army
may be kept well supplied with muni
tions. The supplies ' already on . band
must be greater than was generally
believed, else General Haig would not
have been able to continue his offen
sive without ah intermission. There
was no news this morning of impor
tant 'developments on the remainder
of the western front but at last ac
counts the French were preparing to
resume ' their offensive south of the
Somme, while the Germans were still
hammering at the defenses of Verdun.
The opinion is held in Francehow
ever, that continuation of the Somme
battle will compel" the Germans to
slacken their efforts at Verdun, which
nw have been in progress nearly
five months,' especially as the French
estimate the Germans lost 12,000 men
In counter-attacks on Contalmaison. v
The Russians made no noticeable
advance on any part of their front
since they gained the Stokhod river
where the struggle continues desper-
