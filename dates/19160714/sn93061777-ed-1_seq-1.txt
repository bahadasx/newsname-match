TO START BALL ROLLING
FOR A BIG COUNTY FAIR
Matter Will Be Taken Up at an Important Meeting
of the Chamber of Commerce Next Friday Night.
President Clauie Miller and
Secretary Bert Curless of the
Chamber of Commerce have
started the ball rolling for the
county fair and have made an
urgent appeal to all the members
nf the organization to be present
at tha next regular meeting
which is Friday night July 2lst.
This will be the most impor
tant meeting of the year, a big
attendance ia desired. At this
meeting a final decision will be
made as to what kind of a fair
we are going to have this year.
The date will also be decided
upon.
It is believed by many of the
members that the (best time
for the lair would be about the
middle of October. By this time
the crops would be laid by which
would give the farmers a better
chance to attend. Some believe
that if it is held earlier it might
interfere with the State Fail at
Albuquerque the latter part of
September.
The plan advocated is to ex
tend the fair over a period of
four dayB. This being a political
year the suggestion has been
made that one of the days be
known as Political Day, another
Agricultural Day and a Race
Horse Day. It is believed that
the Carnival which will be one
of the big attractions at the
state fair can be secured and an
etFort will be made to get it.
A move U also being made to
get United States Senator Gore
of Oklahoma to make an address
on Political Day. Both candi
dates for Governor of New Mex
ico will also be invited to address
the gathering.
The leaders are anxious to
make this the best fair ever held
in Curry County, and the citi
zens of Clovis are urged to get
in behind the movement and
push it. Don't forget the meet
ing of the Chamber of Commerce
nc-x; Friday night.
Creamery For Texico
Texico is to have a creamery,
it will be known as the Texico
Farwell Creamery. The capital
stock of the company is $6,000
and this amount has been raised
principally by the citizens of
Texico and Farwell. It was pro
moted by C. A, Miller of Kansas
City, Mo.
Temporary directors have been
elected by the stockholders for
the purpose of selecting a site
and constructing the building.
They are C. W. Harrison, X. K.
Runnells and A. L. King. Per
manent directors will be elected
later. A practical creamery
man will be employed to run the
business. Tne people of the
twin cities on the border deserve
credit for fostering this worthy
enterprise.

The residence of R. R. Neal at
Texico, caught fire at ten o'clock
Saturday night, and was burned
to the ground. The family was
away from home at the time.

Arthur E. Curren
is to Leave Clovis
Arthur E. Curren, firmer
editor and publisher of the
Clovis News will leave Clovis
and expects to locate somewhere
in California. Mr. Curren is
one of the oldest settlers in
Clovis, having come here when
the city started some nine years
igo. We cull him an old settler,
and yet he is only in his early
thirties the very prime of life.
He has probably done as much
for the upbuilding of Clovis and
Curry County as any man in it.
Towns and cities are built up
largely through the efforts of its
newspapers and Clovis has been
no exception.
Mr. Curren was one of the
pioneers having foreseen the
future greatness of Clovis at the
time the railroads came and the
Government land was open for
settlement. For several years
he was U. S. Commissioner and
Register of the United States
Land Office at Fort Sumner and
has always taken an active pari
in the growth and development
of Eastern New Mexico. He is
a native son, having been born
and reared in New Mexico.
He leaves a host of friends
here who with the News join in
wishing him unbounded happi
ness and prosperity in his new
home.

TO DIG A TRENCH
t 'JJ
ON THE BORDER.
NEW MEXICO GETS COLORADO'S
SUMMER TOURIST BUSINESS
Steady Stream of Visitors Coming (Over The Texas
New Mexico Mountain Highway.
New Mexico is taking the
honor from Colorado in the sum
mer tourist business, especially
from points in Texas and Okla
homa. Last year from May to
September a monthly average of
950 automobiles containing ap-
proximately 2850 passengers
came from Texas alone, over the
Texas New Mexico Mountain
Highway.
Officials of this new inter-state
highway advise the News that
the number is being doubled this
year, and that streams of auto
mobiles are daily crossing the
border.
The Texas-Naw Mexico Moun
tain Highway runs from Ama
rillo, Texas via Tucumcari to
Las Vegas, New Mexico, a dis
tance of 252 miles. At Amarilio
it intersects the Colorado to Gulf
Highway, which connects Gal
veston and Houston with Denver.
O. L. Williams, President of
the Colorado to Gulf Highway,
formerly of Bowie, Texas, but
now a resident oi Las Vegas,
has been devoting considerable
time in popularizing and adver
tising the Texas-New Mexico
Mountain Highway throughout
the large cities of Texas and the
heavy traffic that has already
set in is largely the result of his
efforts, He recently finished an
advertising tour of the state
with a train of automobiles,
spreading the gospel of our good
roads and New Mexico's delight
ful summer climate.
Clovis is particularly inter
ested in this movement, as t
large number of these tourists
could be divirtod to this section
by leaving the main highway at
Tucumcari or Amarilio. They
are men that can be interested
in the upbuilding of this part of
the state if the proper efforts are
made. There is no reason why
Colorado should not divide
honors with New Mexico in the
summer tourist business. We
have a better climate than Colo
rado. We have an elevation
ranging from 4200 feet at Clovis
to over 7,000 feet at Las Vegas
and 9,000 at Santa Fe in the
very heart of the Rockies. We
have anything that the tourist
is looking for. inenignts are
delightful and cool, splendid
trout fishing, horseback riding
and mountain climbing.
The Texas New Mexico Moun
tain Highway Association was
organized at a meeting of Texas
and New Mexico Good Koads
enthusiasts which recently con
vened at Santa Rosa, N. M.
The purpose of the organization
is to define, build, signpost,, ad
vise and maintain a through and
continuous overland highway be
tween the mountain resorts of
New Mexico and a convenient
junction with the Colorado-to-the-Gulf
Highway, at Amanlb.
The organization of this inter
state influence and energy for
one purpose was the first direct!
and substantial result ot a com
mon community sentiment which
has be-.-n gradually growing in
both Texas and New Mexico for
a number of years.
The need of a good road con
nection and a closer social and
commercial relation between
these two states which have in
terests in common and so iden
tical and so mutual has been felt
by public leaders of both sides
of the line for some time, so that
an effort to start concerted action
was all that was needed.
Each town and each commun
ity along the entire route is en
thusiastically supporting this
movement. Tourists may feel
assured of all possible courtesy,
assistance and information at
any and all points along the line.
The main highway traverses a
high rolling prairie country.
There are no streams to ford.
The country, in most instances,
is well settled and telephones,
telegraph, railroad, hotel and
garage facilities are reasonably
accessible,
New Mexico Lands Going Up
Well informed stockmen now
predict the time to be close at
hand when New Mexico grazing
Jnd will be in eager demand at
five dollars and up per acre.
The greatest fortunes in this
nation have been made by hold
ing on to land once thought
worthless. Thera may be a
lesson for New Mexico in that
fact Albuquerque Herald.
Land around Clovis in Curry
County brings from $5 to $15 per
acre. These lands are producing
from 12 to 40 bushels of wheat
per acre. Just across the line
in the Texas Panhandle the same
kind of land brings all the way
from $20 to $30 per acre. We
are informed a Chicago coloni
zation company is now bringing
homeseekers by the score into
Farwell and Muleshoe and sell
ing them grazing lands at $50
per acre.
The only difference in Texas
and New Mexico lands here in
the Panhandle is an imaginary
ine. The reason Texas gets
better prices is because they do
more advertising to get settlers,
therefore their lands are better
known. There is no good reason
why settlers fhould be paying
$50 far land in Texas just across
the border when they can secure
the same kind or better land
here at $5 to $15 per acre.
New Mexico should wake up
and let these homeseekers know
about our low priced lands. ' The
best field in the United States
for new settlers is right here in
Eastern New Mexico.
Soldiers Still Coming
Train loads of United States
soldiers continue to pour through
Clovis from points in the East
bound for the border. Monday
evening a tram ot nve cars ot
Notional Guards from Detroit
stopped over for a few hours and
took in the town. They brought
a band along and played some
choice selections at the Santa Fe
depot. A large crowd was at
the station to give the boys a
heirty welcome.
Mr. McCoy, Superintendent of
the Harvey house system, left
Clovis Monday after spending
several days here.
