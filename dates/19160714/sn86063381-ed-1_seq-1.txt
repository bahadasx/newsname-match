(By United Press)
Washington, July 14.The U. S.
Bureau of Fisheries today considered
the man-eating sharks' attack upon
bathers along the New York and
New Jersey coast sufficiently serious
to warrant an official investigation.
The coast guard and life saving sta
tions have been ordered to investi
gate and remove the menace.
Body is Found.
Mattewan, N. Y., July 14.The
terribly mangled body of Lester Still
well, victim of a man-eating shark,
has been recovered in Mattewan
creek. The body had great jagged
wounds in the abdomen and breast
and showed where the shark's teeth
closed over the body.
Coasts Patrolled.

New York and New Jersey coasts to
day, while others lined the beaches
in a concerted effort to exterminate
the man-eater's which have moved
north from their customary haunts,
apparently in large numbers. The
village authorities of Matawan, N. J.,
have offered a reward of $100 for
every shark brought in dead or alive.
One theory is that sharks which
formerly fed on refuse thrown over
board from the many ocean steam
ships which plied the Atlantic before
the war, now have become ravenous.
Even though not ordinarily classed
as man-eaters, it is said, they prob
ably have been driven by starvation
to lurk in the waters of the Atlantic
coast, warm at this season, and at
tack human beings.
Bathers Terrorized.
Three of the huge fishes were seen
in Matakan creek and now are be
lieved to have been bottld up there.
Nets have been stretched under a
bridge about 1% miles from the
mouth of the inlet to prevent egress
into Raritan bay. A British sloop ar
riving from Bermuda reported to
day to have killed a score of sharks
during the voyage, one of fhem off
the New Jersey coast.
Terror has seized the multitudes
who have bathed at beaches along
the New Jersey coasts ,and compara
tively few persons venture into the
water. At Ashbury Park and other
New Jersey resorts wire nets have
been strung around the bathing
areas.
