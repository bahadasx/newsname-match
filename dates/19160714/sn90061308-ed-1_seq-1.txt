COMMISSION MAY
BE NAMED TO END i
. BORDER TROUBLE
Informal Negotiations for Settlement
of Differences "Progressing Fa
vorably," Acting Secretary
-' 1 Says
Washington, July 12. Informal ne
gotiations for settlement of border
disputes between the United States
and the de facto government of Mex
ico are "progressing favorably," Act
ing Secretary Polk said tdday, after
his second conference with Eliseo Ar
redondo, Mexican ambassador desig
nate. .
Although Mr. Polk would not add
to this statement, it is understood,
that the steps now being taken fore
shadow appointment of commissioners
by each government to formulate a
plan of action for the permanent re
lief of border conditions.
Mr. Arredondo has n6t disclosed
what his instructions are, but from
other sources it has been learned that
the commission plan was favored by
General Carranza and his advisers.
It ' is believed probable that the
whole subject of internal conditions in
Mexico, including the financial stress
there, would be reviewed to some ex
tent, with the possible result of some
more far-reaching plan being propos
ed than the one embracing border con
ditions only.

ENCE WITH VIEW TO
HOLDING CONVENTION
Bainbridge Colby of New York, who
Nominated Roosevelt in Progressive
Convention, Savs Meeting Will
Be Held in Chicago at Date to
Be Decided Upon Within
Few Days
New York, July 12. A conference
of representative progressives from
all parts of the country soon will be
held in Chicago, it was announced to
night by Bainbridge Colby, to consid
er "the widespread and bitter revolt
within the party" against the action
of the national committee in endors
ing Charles E. Hughes, the republi
can nominee for the presidency. The
date will be decided upon in a few
days, Mr. Colby said, and he empha
sizes that the conference will be na
tional in scope . .
Mr. Colby, who nominated Roose
velt for the presidency before the na
tional progressive convention at Chi
cago, said that he is in receipt of let
ters from every quarter of the coun
try protesting against what he char-
acteized as the "Perkins--Flinn pro
gram." "This program," he added,
"does not represent the thought . or
feeling of the rank and file of the par
ty." Mr. Colby made public a letter he
had received from John M. Parker of
Louisiana, progressive nominee for
vice president, in which Mr. Parker
referred to "the star chamber" pro
ceeding fjrom the national committee,
adding: "An enormous number of vot
ers will never submit to such treat
ment and I beieve that when we con
sider the millions of women who will
vote this year for the first time, and
the millions of wage-earners who are
deeply interested and believe in the re
forms and betterment for the people
for which we have steadfastly stood,
that if we can succeed in calling a new
convention, preferably on August 5,
the anniversary of the birth of the
progressive party, to demonstrate to
the political bosses our distrust and to
the people of the nation our intention,

to continue our fight for these princi

we will so stir public sentiment that
we may see an overwhelming wave of

pertaining to an independent move for
the next generation .

MEN AND THE PLAIN PEOPLE
We believe that many of the rail
road men of the state will be inter
ested in the candidacy of former Sen
ator Frank W. McAllister, of Paris,
for attorney general on the Democrat
ic ticket. During his eight years'
service in the state senate, he actively
supported many measures advocated
by them and designed to benefit them.
He introduced and secured the passage
of the electric headlight bill, which
was vetoed by Governor Hadley. He
supported the twice-a-month pay day
law, the amendment to the damage act
in 1905, raising the amount to be re
covered for the death of an employe
from $5000 to $10,000 and fixing the
minimum recovery at $2000; the law
of 1907, providing for the survival of
the cause of action where injury re
sults in death; the law requiring the
blocking of frogs, switches and guard
rails; the safety appliance law, and
many other measures advocated by
railroad employes. In fact, he was
invariably found on the side of the
laborers and plain people generally.
They should not forget his services to
them and remember him at the pri
mary on August 1. Joplin Democrat.
