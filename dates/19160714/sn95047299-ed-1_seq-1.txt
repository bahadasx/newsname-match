James C. Vertrees for more than
30 years prominently identified with
the business life of Palatka and head
of the wholesale grain and fertilizer
firm of Vertrees & Company, died sud
denly in Johns Hopkins hospital, Bal
timore, Md., last week Thursday.
The body was brought to this city for
interment.
The funeral service was held at tha
homo of his sister, Mrs. John X. Wal
ton on Riverside Drive, last Sunday
afternoon at 3:30, and was attended
by a large number of people, former
friends of the deceased business man.
The obsequies were conducted by Rev.
S. Grady of the Methodist church, as
ssited by Rev. R. L. lloniker of South
Jacksonville, a tormer pastor and in
timate friend of the family. The in
terment was temporarily in West
View cemetery. This fall the body
will be taken to Tennessee for per
manent interment in the family vault.
Mr. Vertrees had been in ill health
for some time, and curly in June, ac
companied by his nephew-, Attorney
J. V. Walton, went to Johns Hopkins
hospital, Baltimore, for treatment. It
was found that an operation was ne
cessry and this was performed. It
was most successful and the patient
continued to improve. He was in
the convalescent ward and spent his
days largely in the open waiting for
the wounds caused in the operation to
heal. It was then that he was tak
en suddenly ill. His sister was noti
fied, and in companv with her broth
er, Maj. W. O. Vertrees of Nashville,
left Palatka Thursday morning for
Baltimore.
Of course they did not reach that
city in time to see their brother alive.
Before leaving Baltimore with the
body Mrs. Walton and her brother
consented to a post mortem which re
vealed his original trouble as perfect
ly nomal, and showed as was sus
pected that his death was due to
pneumonia.
Mr. Vertrees came to Palatka from
Gallatin, Tenn., and was of an old and
distinguished family of Southrons
He was born in 1851), and since 1SS4
had been a reident of this city. His
brother is Hon. John J. Vertrees of ,
Nashville. Tenn., one of the most dis
tinguished of our American lawyers.
Another brother is Maj. W. O. Ver
trees, also of Nashville. Both these
gentlemen have summer cottages at
Summer Haven Beach, and were there
and therefore present at the funeral.
Mr. Vertrees sold his interests in
the business he has followed hero so
manv years late in May.

The launch Kingfisher until a few
weeks ago plying between Palatka
and Drayton Island, and property of
Capt. A. O. Hiscock, was wrecked in
the fierce storm which raged over
Gulf coasts towns on July 5th. The
steamer Harry Lee, also property of
('apt. Hiscock, and which with the
Kingfisher was taken to Mobile early
last month, was saved, but was badly
damaged.
("apt. Hiscock writes that the King
li. her is a total loss. He says "the
Hairy I.ee was about to go down
when a heavy barge tore loose and
came iver on top of the Kingfisher,
breaking the Harry Bee from her
moorings and driving her into a slip
alongside a steamship. All kinds of
hipping wa.s adrift and thousands of
hales of cotton were nflonting about.''
("apt. Hiscock further states that
the crew stood by the Harry Lee at
tiie risk of their lives and finally sav
ed her from destruction. All the men
comprising the crews of both boats
aie safe and in good condition. The
liarry l.ee was in charge of Capt. O.
A. Hiscock, and his son, Capt. Hubert
liiseoek was in command of the King
fisher. K; iends (,f Capt. Hiscock and son
and members of their respective
eiews in Palatka and at all the river
points h:ne been very anxious con
!:. ir.g their safety, and as the wires
were all down it was impossible to get
word concerning them until the re
ceipt of ('apt. Iliscock's letter of Wed
nesday. An Associated Press account of the
storm with special reference to the
damage about Mobile, says that
'The waterfront at a casual glance
might give an impression of great de
struction, as logs, poles, lumber, drift
wood, pieces of wharfage and other
debris from the river and bay are piled
along the shore and docks in a mass
of wreckage. Many small boats and
a number cf packets, schooners, barg
es and in several instances excursion
; steamers at various points along the
waterfront stand outlined in relief
from the debris and on damaged
wharves where they were blown or
washed by the wind or waves from
the river and bay.
'A checking up of the shipping
losses showed that the essels sunk in
the river near the city during the
storm included three small steamers,
one of which has since been raised;
fourteen barges, nine of them loaded
with coal: several small schooners
and two tugs. There was no life loss
on vessels sunk in the river. Near
port Morgan the schooner Emma S.
Lord was sunk with a toss of four
lives, and the barge liarry T. Morse
was swamped and eight persons
drowned.
"Among the vessels ashore or on
the docks in the three-mile stretch
of waterfront from One-mile Creek
to Choctaw Point were three ships,
one baik, seven schooners, three
small steamers, two packets, a pilot
boat, half a dozen barges, two dry
docks, several small schooners and
numerous small launches and boats.
Along almost the entire waterfront
, there is scattered about 11,000 bales
of co! ton and many thousands of
staves, barrels of various commodi
ties, etc.. which were swept from the
Municipal and Mobile & Ohio docks
by the water that rushed in from the
river and bay.
"No large building in the city, with
the exception of a few in the jobbing
district near the city, shows signs of
being badlv damaged or wrecked.
Very few dwellings in the residence
section of the town were demolished,
but a number of small shacks were
blown down without any causalities.
The principal losses to buildings were
due to broken windows, roofs torn off
or damaged and the resultant leakage
from the rain during the storm, and
also the heavy rain on Friday whica
added to the damage."

Wade on Wednesday.
Hon. W. G. Tilghman of this city
has purchased of Thos. Murray, ad
ministrator Of the PKtntp nf tha lnta
Martin Griffin, the thirty acre tract
j in cast. raiatKa Known as the Griffin
i Grove. The property contains some
! eleven acres in ni-nium ti-ww tUn
j anee being land not under cultivation.
During the lile of Mr. Griffin, the
grove wa.s well kept up and was a
thing of beauty, but owing to lack of
fertilizer, especially in the past two
years, the property has not been kept
in the best shape.
The sale wa.s made throne-h Col. TT.
M. de Mnntmollin, as attorney for
jonn i. i.ritnn, one ol the heirs.
The chief value of the property is
in the fact that it is directly on the
new brick highway which is to be laid
immediately running from Palatka to
Hastings, St. Augustine, a direct con
nection with the Dixie Highway. The
consideration is not given, but it is
understood that Mr. Tilghman secured
a more than bargain.

INFANTILE PARALYSIS
SCARESJiEW YORKERS
Doctors Hope to Have Foaiui
Way of Isolating the
Germ.
While Health Commissioner Emer
son of New York has declined to dis
cuss the report that a New York phy
sician has succeeded in isolating the
germ of infantile paralysis, great im
portance was attached by medical
men to the meeting of physicians call
ed for last night to be devoted to a
discussion of a disease that has cost
more than 250 lives in greater New
York since the epidemic began.
It is semi-offieially admitted that
scientists have progressed so far that
they a.re testing a culture in which
they believe they will find traces of
the germ and ultimately isolate it.
Out of a total of 1,400 cases sine--;
the epidemic developed there have
been 287 deaths, it wa.s officially an
nounced by the department of health
tonight.
Cases have been reported tit Toledo,
Cincinnati, New Orleans, Newborn,
Tenn.,. and Atlanta.
ST. MARK'S CHURCH
CALLS JEW RECTflP.
St. Mark's Episcopal church in this
city has just called a new rector in
the person of Rev. Crittenton, Arch
deacon of Dallas, Texas.
J. II. Haughton, acting for the ves
try of the church notified Bishop
Weed of the vestry's action early in
the week, but as Bishop Weed was
at Apalachicola and caught in the re
cent storm, it is not known what ac
tion he has taken, or whether he has
received the Palatka letter.
To Bishop Weed wa.s left the mat
ter of communicating with Archdea
con Crittenton.
It is known that the archdeacon lie
sires to come to Florida and Bishop
Weed had recommended him to the
vestry of the Church of the Good
Shepherd, Jacksonville, but that
church desired a younger man, and
has called a clergyman who has only
attained to his 34th year, while Arch
deacon Crittenton is about 50. All
else being equal, the Palatka church
seems to have gotten the better of
the Jacksonville church. A little ex
perience, along with a rector's learn
ing and other accomplishments is
worth much in any man's field iK in
fluence, especialy in the ministry.
Mr. Haughton is looking for a re
ply in the next week or two. In
case the newly called rector decides
to accept the call, he will not likely
come to Palatka before September
1st.
Next Sunday Rev. Mr. Ross will
officiate at St. Mark's at 11 a. m.,
and 7:30 p. m.
Birthday Tarty.

The following young Misses were Miss
I.enora's guests: Kathleen Leeks,

An Appreciation.
Not until the last rssuo of The
News, which published a list of
teachers for the coming year, did the
many friends of Prof. R. W. Van
Brunt, and patrons of the school give
credence to the current report that
ho would not again be principal of
Putnam High School.
This is indeed to be regretted, and
the loss of this splendid educator and
Christian gentleman as head of our
facility will be keenly felt. During
the live years Prof. Van Brunt has
been principal, the school has grown
ami improved in many ways. The
standard of the school has been raised
to such a degree that only our poor
equipment kept us from ranking as .
senior high school.
Music was introduced and a credit
able library added; also a small
chemical and physical laboartory
equipped, and considering the poor
facilities and the adverse conditions,
Prof. Van Brunt has had splendid re
sults. We note that Prof. Van Brunt's
many friends are making every ef
fort to have him remain in Palatka
and we certainly trust that they will
be successful, as Palatka cannot af
ford to lose such an exemplary citi
zen. Communicated.
Dr. Bonsteel to Preach.
Rev. Dr. R. L. Bonsteel, pastor of
the Baptist church at Crescent City
for the past year, has been engaged
to supply the pulpit of the First Bap
tist church next Sunday, morning and
evening.
Dr. Bonsteel is a preacher of ability
and his sermons are always most in
teresting. He is a man of culture
and intellectual ability and ranks
among the foremost preachers of his
denomination in the State. Since
going to Crescent City a little more
than a year ago he has built up the
church there so that its membership is
now the largest in the place. He has
been instrumental in arousing interest
and the church is just completing a
beautiful pastorium at a cost of nearly
$2,000 besides repainting and repairing
the church house.
Before entering the ministry Dr.
Bonsteel was a successful lawyer in
Kentucky, his native state.
The local church officers hope to
have a pulpit supply during every
Sunday . of Pastor Cason's absence,
and the supply for the Sunday follow
ing will be announced in this paper.
DOES BILLY PHER

Title.
Esperanza-On-The-St. John's.
The Men's Club of the Presbyterian
church with their lady friends, about
forty in number, went down the river
Tuesday evening in the "Margaret,"
the Esperanza and the Bruce launch
to the lovely home of Mr. and Mrs
S. 0. Warner.
The house was beautifully Humiliat
ed and Mrs. Warner with her daugh
ter, Miss Helen, received their guests
on the veranda. After a brief busi
ness meeting, presided over by the
president, the honorable W. P. Mer
riam, a musical and literary program
was carried out. Mrs. Alston R. Haile
captivated her audience with several
vocal selections, Mrs. C. M. Alford
gave several readings with musical
settings, that charmed her audience.
The Victrola also furnished splendid
music throughout the evening. . As
Dr. Alford introduced the performers,
he threw in several stories of a humer
ous nature which kept things moving.
Mr. Frank Chapman chairman of the
entertainment committee contrbuited
greatly to the success of the gather
ing. Mr. Chapman with his committee
served delicious punch and cake. The
evenng being moonligt was delightful
cverv wav for such a trip and Mr.
and Mrs. Warner with their daughter.
Miss Helen, are charming hosts and
treated their guests most royally.
Matters are becoming complicated
at Edgewater.
Only a few weeks ago it was re
ported that Billy Parker had pur
chased the property of a Palatka
agent. You all know Billy, at least
by reputation, and he has some repu
tation. He is the guy whom his Pa
latka deseiples profess to believe was
raised up out of the pit (coal pit) to
punch the Roman Hierarchy in the
same effective manner used by the
mysterious person who hit Billy Pat
terson and made that gentleman's
quietus the problem of the nation.
Parker lectured in the New Howell
Theater a couple times last winter,
taking as the subject of his discourse
"Henry McKenzie, Spencer Middle
ton and the Non-Inspection of Nun
neries." Parker is a rip-snorting
speaker of the new school. He hates
Rome: No, "hate" is too feeble a
word; he loathes, detests; his very
soul with strong disgust is stirred
whenever in his meanderings h-i
meets with a real papal bull.
When it wa.s reported that Billy
was coming t0 the County of Put
nam, State of Florida, ss, to reside,
Koine Howled and the Cattsist-is
clapped thei:' hands with ioy.
Edgewater is a beautiful place. It
is on the banks of the limpid St.
Johns River; in fact it comes right
down to the edge of the water, hence
its name.a. name given the place by
its original owner, a Mr. Fuller of
Brooklyn, X. Y.. a brewer of beer,
and who knew little concerning the
uses of water for beverage purposes.
Billy Parker is in Gpnvfrin nnw
appealing to the protestants of that
suae to rnrow on tneir Koman shack
les and follow- such men as Tommy
Wat sen and another; whom he is too
modest to mention.
But Billy's sons are nt. Fdtrownlov
They are putting the place in order
ami using tneir spare moments for
fishing purposes. They hve been
learning to call it home.
But this is the point where George
White of Haekensack, N. J., steps in.
Mr. White was a visitnr ti P.ilflr..
in April; he spent several days in and
about here, making trips to the coun
try in company with some of the gen
tlemen connected with the Florida
Farms & Homes, Inc. He really
came to Palatka to see Edgewater.
Ho made sorr-po! trirw ilim-o nn.1
amined the place carefully. Then ho
purchased the place of Mrs. Rigers
of Brooklyn, the owner. Mrs. Rogers
an never seen the place, but her hu".
!t,d was here and made the nnivhuso
of Dr. Rix.
Mrs. Rogers has written thrit m
one m l ntkn hod .nit'mrilir tn eMl
her property. She has sold it her-
sen ro .nr. unite. She repudiates
the Parker deal, and as n dnr.fl fr.-.m
her is necessary it looks as if sho
rield the whip hand.
So Billy may not be one of ns nftev
all. Well, it is too bad, but though
he may depart, there is this consola
tion, his influence is still felt here.
The report current on the street
that the Roman Pontiff has had a
band in preventing Billy to get Edge
water can not be verified. The News
saw Roy Smith and ho said ha
didn't think there was any truth in
the report. Roy is a papal leader
here and he ain't afraid of a papal
bull.
Hamp .Moody Buys Place.
Ha m p Moody has returned to Put
nam county to abide. Ho has pur
chased a place in Peniel and will pro
ceed to build a home thereon. "Yes,"
said he, "Putnam county is good
enough for me; I've been away two
years and was anxious to get back;
no place in the State can beat old
"itnam county for soil and people."
Special Picture Play.
St. Johns Lodge, Knights of Pythias
of this city have by special arrange
ment, secured an elaborately staged 6
rcel photoplay of the famous Grecian
story, Damon and Pythias, to be shown
at Kalbfield's Grand next Sunday for
three performances, viz., matinee at
3 p. m., and again at 7:30 and 9 p. m.
The scene of the motion picture pro
duction was laid in southern Califor
nia, and the principle roles were as
sumed by some of the most celebrated
motion picture artists in the world.
This "Damon and Pythias" photo
play cost more than .$30,000 to pro
duce, the biggest single item being the
eight Arabian horse, which cost $1,
500 each. Then the arena had to be
made, the great stadium, seating a
thousand people, built and the chariots
constructed of the strongest material.
To stage such a scene true to life
melts money, but the wonderful re
sult is said to have justified the out
lay.. This classical production, represent
ing the principles upon which the or
der of the Knights of Pythias were
founded, is being shown over the
country by that order for educational
purposes and to acquaint the people
with the fundamental principles of the
Knights of 1'ythias. It is shown free.
No charge for admittance is made
at any of the above performances.
People attending church services in
j the evening can see the 9 o clock pro
I duction.
