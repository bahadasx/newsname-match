depends upon the successes of the
allies in their present offensives. If

German lines and are steadily push

regard the time as inopportune and
will have little or nothing to say

If an appeal is issued, it will con

Stillwell, victim of tho ma^-eating

of Matawan creek early today. Great
japped wounds In the abdomen and
breast showed where the shark's
teeth had closed over the twelve year
old boy's body.
Hanry Vane Use, an engineer on the

day. They pulled the body ashore and
summoned the county physician. Lat

autopsy will be performed this after
noon. Meanwhile physicians who, ex
amined the boy's torn remains said
tho left side of the abdomen had been
ripped open and the flesh torn from
the right breast. The face showed
no contusions.
It was their theory that the shark
nlust have been about twelve or fif
teen feet in length and the location of
the terrible wounds showed, in their
belief, that the fish seized the boy
across the middle of the body, rather
than striking at his feet and les*.
All other cases of attack by sharks
so far reported have shown that the
man-eaters struck for the legs of their
victims.
News of the recovery of little Les

forts to capture the man eater.
The United Press staff correspond

boy's body. The rlgnt and left breasts
had been terribly torn. Apparently
the shark had bitten at the flesh sev
eral times. Another gaping hole was
torn in the boy's abdomen. The flesh
from the calf of one leg was missing
from the bones. Shark experts to
whom these wounds wore described,
said it ,waa apparent the man killer
had made several "strikes" at the
body and probably each wound rep

COLUMBUS. N. M., July 14—Be
cause of hasty physical examination
before leaving Massachusetts for the
border, militiamen stationed here may
have to submit to a more severe med
ical test. The prospects are thai
this would deplete the ranks. Pre
cautions are necessary to weed out
weaklings, who become pensioners if
disabled.
Several militiamen affected by the
heat during hikes, dropped in their
tracks and were brought back to
camp in automobiles. Thoir condition
is not serious. Humidity from recenf
rains and a temperature of 98 made
the weather oppressive.
Plans are being made for a long
stay by the national guardsmen.
Wooden flooring is being constructed
in the tents, and the men are building
minature adobe walls around their
tents to keep out water during heavy
rains. A higher and dryer camp Is
being prepared for the militia. Six
hundred more guardsmen are expect
ed Saturday.
"From indications we will be on the
border some time," said Colonel
Hayes, "and many are arranging for
every physical comfort."
Following the rains, awarmaof
sand flies have appeared to make lire
miserable for the Incautious militia

A bitter protest has goae up from
New Mexico militia recruits over the
quartermaster general's order that
men who enlisted after state mobili
zation, were not entitled to pay until
mustered Into federal service and if
rejected lose their time and money
spent awaiting the physical examina
tion. United States Senator A. B.
Fall made a visit to the base camp
here to investigate the effects of the
order with a view to taking up the
matter at Washington. Over 300 New
Mexico recruits, including many who
waited here weeks, are out railway
fare and time. One man came from
Kansas City, Mo., waited a month for
examination and was rejected. He
lost his position and borrowed money
to return.
