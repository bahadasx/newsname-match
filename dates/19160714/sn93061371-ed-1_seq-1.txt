When Tim saw her, sweeping grace
fully through the offices, her golden
hair falling lightly over her sturdy
young shoulders, he forgot all about
the little stenographer. The girl was
Madge Jenkins, daughter of Mr. Dud
ley Jenkins, senior partner of Jenkins
& Rarr.
The girl had gone straight to her fa
tfWr' off!le and ft few minutes later
was seeii stifij DM ogain at her fa
ther's side apparently' tn hve lunch
with him at his downtown clulf,
Somohow the air was fresher and
the day was brighter to Tim Austin
bocause of that visit of Madge Jenkins.
She was Just in her teens at the time
and Tim, at sixteen, was beglunlng
his career.
Once It was two years later and
by" his tima Tim had come to regard
the girl as1 his presiding divinity
Madge had brought bf?f floij to the
dfllce with her.
"Would you bo so good could you
just liolu hf In loash' tflt I come out?"
Then, after he ii'di twriied the dog
Injured in a Runaway.
The many friends and ac
quaintances of Robfc. L. Scott,
'who homestoaded and lived for
a tiHni'jer of years 5 miles south
of Kenna, will bg very sorry to
know the painful and unfortu
nate accident which is related
in the clipping below - from the
Panhandle Weekly.' Mr. Scott
came to thid country in. 1907,
and after making proof on his
homestead here, moved to Vega,
Texas, about, two years ago.
We hope and triwt that the op
eration may ba successful and
that he will fooii be out again.
'."Robert Scott of Vega, was
brought to Amarillo last week
iifter bavins been injured in a
runaway. Mr. Scott was break
ing a colt which became unman
ageable and ran Jaway. Mr
Scott, who had his small eon
vii,h hinl jumped out on rough
gibun I causing such a bad
fracture that it was necessary
to amputate the leg."
to its pretty owner, after he had been
introduced to her by Mr. Jenkins him
self, he realized for the first time th
breach that lay between them. What
must be her contempt for him? Th
fact that bo was no longer office boy,
that he had obtained rapid promotion
and had even been taken out to lunck
at the Club by the "boss" seemed to
make no difference. Then came the
day when Mr. Jenkins asked him to
have dinner with him at his home.
As they were taking the elevator It
vas skin to a blow to have Mr. Jen
kins say: "My daughter will be dis.
appointed not to be at home. But It
is tne nigtit or soma sort oi acnoob
ftlvlty." i
Then came a time when Jenkins and
Bart" tarted company, and for busi
ness reasons Tint was retained by Barr
Instead of Jenkins. AW that happened
before Tim was two and twenty.
Now, with anyone but Tim It might
have been simply a passing memory
that little experience with the gold.--eu-haired
Madge. But to Tim it was
much more than that. It was even
enough to account for the faet that he 1
fifcver took more than a very passing,
Interest fa the girls he met. At twenty-six
or' stives, when the Blgn over his
6Hlce door read "Barr & Austin," be '
had! earned for himself the reputation
of !ifc!i8f tmmnue so far as pretty girls
were concerned .
Poor Showing Made
tly Chaves Teachers
The recent hot weather down
in Chavt-s county may be re
ApoiiKible for the rather poor
showing made by the teachers
at the examinations taken fol
lowing the institute. It is now
estimated not more t han 00 per
anl of the Chaves teachers pas
sed the examinations, The pa
pers of Chaves county have
been grade.-! and this estimate
of 00 per cent was made today.
It means that four out of ten
teachers will have to to insti
tute again and try to pass a bet
ter exam.
Chaves county is the first of
the 20 counties in tho state to
b completed. The reading
board is at work on tho papers
of the other counties, and it will
require several weeks to read
th-iin. Hantu Fc New Mexican
Very dry farming poems to be
the order of the day.
Another shower fell on the
Kenna community Tuesday eve
and again Wednesday noon.
"Is this Mr. Barr?" She, the one'
who asked this question, was a quiet
ly dressed little person who had ben
ushered Into Tim Austin's presence by
his office boy as a "young lady looking
(or a Job." Austin was somewhat an
noyed by the intrusion, but as a matter
of fact, he neoded a new typist and
niado & mis always to interview per
sonally those whose names went down
on his pay roll. This time, however,
Tim scarcely looked up at the young
woman. Something In her general ap-,
pearance and in the tone of her vic
reassured him that she would b a
satisfactory employee."
For a week or so Tim saw little of
the new typist. Once or twice be
hflsrd Barr say that she was pretty
hut Cut Idea of prettinesa in any em
ployee Interested Tim not at all. If
any lutt-rest did come to him with re
gard to the new typist it was because
she apparently wanted to avoid him,1
because sho found an excuse always
to leave any room he happened to
enter.
It was in March when the big snow
storm of the winter occurred that
ysar, and Tim Austin was not espe
cially surprised that out of the four or
five members of the entire establish-'
fjiont who ventured out that day and
arrived at work on time, the new!
typist was'one. Needless to say, Tim
was also on time. His own sten
ographer had not arrived and it oc
curred to him that the new typist
might be able to take his dictation. , i
Hurriedly be made his way into the
large, light room where she did her -work.
When he opened the door she
gave a little cry of alarm. She was1
standing before the radiator somewhat
the worst for her encounter with the
storm. She had spread out her coat'
to dry and was holding her hands to
the heat. But what Tim noticed and
What bad caused the cry of alarm was
that the now typist's hair was hang
ing, disheveled and moistened by tho
.snow, over her shoulders.
Tim stopped with sudden surprise.
For the first time he looked searchiug
ly at the girl. Yes, it really was. It
was the same hair, those were the
same eyea, and that was the same'
voice. It was actually Madge Jenkins.
"I have always been faithful to the
memory of the only girl that ever
charmed me," he said as soon as he
could trust himself to speak. "I sup
pose it is always that way when a man
really loves, even if he Is only a cal
low omce boy at the time."
"But why did. you never let me
know?" she asked, with the name
voice that had charmed him so many
years before.
"So long as you had money and posi
tion I never could have told you I
loved you," Tim said, "but now it Isn't
so very difficult, it Beeins strange
that I should be glad of your apparent
misfortune. Perhaps I can do some
thing for your father if he has failed.
It is a long time since I have heard
of him."
Madge looked up at him with glow
ing checks and sparkling eyes. They
kissed.
