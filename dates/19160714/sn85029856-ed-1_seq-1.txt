on its back they will add a trailer
for a baggage wagon.
Yellowstone National Park is
about 1000 miles directly northwest
of Liberal, with good roads practi

Tune: "Don't Bite the Hand That's Feeding You"
Last night as I lay a sleeping
A wonderful dream came to me ;
I saw the great southwest country
And I knew what the prospects would be;
I saw in the distance a city
That seemed to outshine all the rest;
When I asked in my dream what they called it
The answer was Liberal the best.
Chorus
If you don't like the town that you live in
If you don't like the place where you trade,
Come to a town of fame,
Liberal is its name ;
We'll show you that Liberal is true.
If you want to know the reason that we prosper
And the reason that our patrons do the same,
We don't act like the mail-order faker,
We're not the kind that's fleecing you.
There's a town in the southwest of Kansas,
Surrounded with golden grain ;
'Tis the Cap'tal of the Southwest country,
Every nation has heard of its fame ;
The Chamber of Commerce has helped it,
And its people are loyal and true ;
They always have the glad hand for strangers
So they're sure to welcome you.

ment, and expected to cut the wood
and build the fires.
Mrs. Baughman expects to regain
her falling health and increase her
weight, and last, but not the most
energetic, John W will spend a
large portion of his time lying on his
back, not gazing at the stars, but
peering into the complicated interior
of the National, and wondering what
the ails it. The car will have
its face washed before the start, and
barring an accident or rain, It will
get no more baths during the ensu
ing four weeks.

PREPARING TO ENTERTAIN THE
BOOSTERS
Haryey W. Hill, editor of the Beav
er County Republican at Gray, Okla
homa, can always be depended Upon
to do the right thing. He is having
extensive preparations made in his
little city to entertain the Liberal
Boosters next week. The following
announcement appeared in last
week's issue of the Republican: '
"Tuesday, July 18th, is to be the
big day at Gray for on that occasion
the Liberal boosters will be here.
There will be from 40 to 60 cars con
taining from 200 to 250 people, and
they are coming prepared to show
our people a time that they will nev
er forget. They will have their band,
a special violinist, many other special
features, and Lee Larrabee will bring
his bear. In tact the day will be Just
like Christmas for they will have a
present for all that attend this gath
ering. In this connection we wish to
impress upon our citizens the fact
that while the Liberal people are
coming prepared to entertain us we
must make it convenient in every
way for them to do so. For this rea
son it will be necessary for our farm
ers and home people to hitch their
teams and place their autos back of
the business houses and on the va
cant lots surrounding the church
building and school house, as the
main street and the street running
north and south through the center
of town will be needed for the people
and for Liberal visitors to place their
cars and to pull off their various
stunts. It Is hoped everybody will
remember this and do their part in
helping make It pleasant and con
venient for our visitors."
ANOTHER GOOD MAN GONE
WRONG
We were severely schocked Wed
nesday morning when we were ap
proached by Ray Millman and asked
it we wanted a ride In his blankety

down to the office to give our life
insurance policies the once over and
know for sure that they were all In
force an d fWt, we mad, the yea
fare' and rode a'few mftesHrjtalum;'
and came back alive, strange o say;
Ray has annexed a Ford runabout
"for campaign purposes only," he
claims, and will now proceed to beat
up the brush In search of voters. He
has already learned the difference be
tween the gas tank and the radiator,
and hopes in a few weeks to be able
to locate the carburetor by his own
efforts. As yet he doesn't feel fa
miliar enough with the "critter" to
challenge Barney Oldfleld for a race,
but hopes to enter the speedway con
test at the Southwest Fair next fall.
IT RAINED WEDNESDAY NIGHT
Seward county was visited by a
good rain Wednesday night. J. G.
Ault, the local observer, reports a
fall of .97 of an inch. It Is a wet
come relief from the continued hot
spell the country has undergone the
last tew weeks and will prove a de
cided benefit to the growing row
