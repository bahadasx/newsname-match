SHAKES HANDS WITH OLD
TIME PALS OF THIS TOWN
George W. Rowo of Glonwood,
New Mexico, proprietor of the
Frisco Hot Springs, miner, car
penter, cattleman, farmer, was in
town last week for a few days.
"I have been in Lordsburg only
once, and then for only a few
hours, since thirty-two years ago
last February,' said Mr. Rowe,
"and in that time I have seen a lot
of Grant county. I have been in
many towns in New Mexico, and
have wandered over almost every
nook and cranny in the state, and
I have yet to see a place t hat I
like better than dear old Lords
burg. I would have been here yet
too, if my wild roaming spirit
hadn't called me to see other pla
ces. I built almost the first house
in the town, and was among the
first contractors to engage in the
building business here. Not many
of the Old Timers aro loft any
more. They seem to have wander?
ed away like I did. And yet thcro
are a few. I shook hands today
with Harry Small, Lou Morris aad
Johnnie Brown and there are oth
ers which I am going to see be-thc Springs arc some of the most
foro going back to Glenwood- Do
you know what the namo of the
first paper published in Lordsburg
was? Well, it was tho Lordsburg
Advance and I have a copy of that
paper yet,"
Mr. Rowe is an interesting man
and speaks out with a broad knowl
edge of things and conditions in
New Mexico. Ho is engaged ex
tensively in mining in the San
Francisco mountains and owns the
ranch at Glcnwood. His interests
are rather large in tho 'Frisco val
ley, part of which he has taken
for his summer resort?, the Hot
Spring's, and upon which ho is
spending a small fortune.
The little town of Plcasanton on
the San Francisco River was the
first settlement in or near the Mo
gollón Mountains. Tho early Mor
mon frontiersmen, braving the
wilds and danger of the Apache
country, settled in tho hunting
grounds of the Victorio Gerónimo
and Nana at the time when the
hardiest men in the country with
their wives and families wore
slowly and surely reaching out to
grasp the last retreat of tho fierc
est and most savage tribe of the
North American Indian. Ho was
not then "Poor Lo."
Plcasanton was settled by the
Mormons in the middle of the last
century and in a few years there
was a large number of people in
the valley, and they were so strong
that there was little to fear from
even Victorio and his braves. Two
miles down tho 'Frisco, as It is
generally called, io located the Hot
Springs belonging to Mr. Rowe,
and which he calls, after the Riv
er, the Frisco Hot Springs. The
water is very warm, and unless a
person is used to the heat, or takes
it slowly, he will think that he has
jumped into boiling water when
he first takes a plunge. Opposite
beautiful and fantastic etchings on
the rock walls lining the river of
any in the whole district, and it
has been acknowledged by experts
that the early tribes of cliff dwell
ers in. this part of the southwest
were farther advanced than those
of other regions. Mr. Rowo has
very definite plans for the resort,
and is carrying them out with his
accustomed energy. Thcro is to be
a largo lake of cold water adjoin
ing tho Springs, and with tho mod
cm convenience's "which ho plans
to install at once, Tno Frisco Hot
Springs will very likely become in
the future one of New Mexico's
most popular summer resorts

VALUABLE LIFE TAKEN
Henry Quast, a well-known ice
cream dealer of Doming, was shot
and mortally wounded Friday
night a week ago about nino
o'clock. Doming has been under
very strict police law, almost ap
proaching martial law, since the
Mexican situation has loomed un.
and especially on account of the
recent hangings. The incident of
the fatal shooting of Quast by a
Deming officer is a sad but defin
ite reminder of tho necessity of
quick compliance with official or
ders.
At the inquest held the next day
by Judge Rogers, tho officers wcro
exonerated. It was held that they
had acted under orders from Sher-
ÍI Simpson to guard things close
ly, it being the night of the fire at
the Union depot. Both officers,
Black and Graham, will answer to
the grand jury in September, in
order to conform to the law. Here
s ono other life taken, growing at
least partly, out of tho Mexican
situation. "
ANNUAL MEETING
OF DENTAL MEN
í)r. R. E. Buvcns returned Mon
day from Dona Ana' where he
spent Sunday with his sister. He
was in El Paso Wednesday on his
way to the annual convention of
the Dental Association of New
Mexico. Tho convention lasted
three days, Thursday, Friday and
Saturday. Most of the sessions
wore held in tho Commercial Club
building. A big banquet was the
feature of the Saturdays meet
ing, and closed the most success
ful meeting in the history of the
young association.
Dr. Buvcns is the local dentist
and comes home filled with the best
thihgs offered by the foremost lec
turers and dentists, many of whom
took leading parts in the Albu
querque convention. Dr. Buvcns
is enthusiastic especially over the
now discoveries relative to Nerve
Blocking. Several lectures, illus
trated by moving pictures and stc
redpticon slides wore given, show
ing the technique of working on
teeth by tho new method. It was
8h6wn to be almost painless to the
patient, and if so, the terrors of
tooth filling and bridging will be
over. Charts, skulls, wet anatom
ical specimens were used, besides
a number of practicol operative
cases. Part of the film work was
taken in tho nation renowned
Cook County Hospital, Chicago.
Ihe three days were filled with
important events, beginning at
9:00 a. m. Thursday and closing
with the big banquet Saturday at

LINES FROM BUSH
Fans V. Bush, owner of the
Western Liberal, has arrived in
Los Angeles, according to reports
received here.
Ho is staying at the Hotel
Northern, and enjoying himself
hugely. The only trouble seems
to be that he is liable to forget

spend all the time in fun, He
says he wishes all the people of
Lordsburg a Happy July.

regular cession Monday night
Besides several important ordin

Big Diesel Engine Blown to Pieces
At The 85 Mine Thursday Morning
450 HORSE POWER ENGINE AT BIG MINING PLANT COLLAPSES
Qn Thursday morning of the 6th, the 450 horse power Diesel
wcrude oil burning engine suddenly rose in the air and scat
tered itself over the mountain side on which is situated the site of
the 85 Mining Company. Luckily, there was no one very near the
power house at the time, no one was injured.
Ihe 85 Company is one of the largest producers in the county.
The workings are two miles from the town of Lordsjburg. A. J.
Inderrieden is General Manager and and J. W. Jackson is Superin
tendent. The company has recently been shipping 7500 tons of
ore to the Calumet & Arizona smelter of Douglas per month. A
much larger amount could easily be shipped except for the inability
of the smolters to handle it. The bulk of the ore is copper sulphide
and carries 72 per cent silica. A depth of about 500 feet has been
reached and the workings including the tunnels total many thous
and feet. '
Another new engine is on th& way here and may arrive any day.
Until it comes, the operators will have their hands full. Trouble
with the engine started some time ago, and altho therfc was some
talk of danger, no one expected that there would be an explosion.

ENGINEER LINDER DEAD
Engineer W. A.Linder. one of
the Southern Pacific's trained and
experienced men and one of tho
most popular of the S- P. trainmen
of the division lost his life by being
struck by a man crane last Friday
morning. Mr. Lindcr was watch
ing a hot box near Carne and fail
ed to notice the crane until too
late. The crane struck him above
and behind the left car, rendering
him unconscious.
Engineer Lindcr was taken to
the Ladies Hospital in Doming,
and operated upon, but he never
regained consciousness. Mrs. Lin
der came from her home in El Paso
and rendered all tho aid that a
loving wife could, but it was no
use, and one of the most valued
employees of the Southern Pacific
passed out of existence.
Soverc Case of BloodPoisoning
From Dog Bite
Theodore Brad berry, who lives
on the Gila river, below Rcdrock,
is having a very serious time
with his arms. About two weeks
uro he was bitten severely on
the hands and left arm by a dog,
there has developed one of the
worst cases of blood poisoning
over attended by the local doctors.
His left arm is almost decom
posed to the elbow. The right
hand is also in a precarious con
dition. He can not feed himself
and is entirely helpless.
Woman Implicated in Parker
Murder in Jail
The Mexican woman, wife of.
the man who is saidito have mur
dered Will E. Parker and wife,
Alice Krebauni-Parker. on their
ranch south of Hachita, is held
in the county jail at Silver City,
pending further investigations.
There seems to be little hope of
ever catching Ihe man who did
the foul deed. He is one of the
kind who prefers his own safety
to that of aiding others. He leit
his wife at a ranch when pursuit
got loo hot, and (led into the
mountains south of the border.
He may by this time, have joined
Villa or some other hand of law
less brigands which infest the
border between here and old
Mexico. The wife tells a pitiful
story of how the deed was pro
petrated, and the (light after
wards. Two horses and accour
trements seem to be the only
reason for the murder as far as
can be learned at the present
time.

Mine Theater last Saturday night.
