That the suer-:-:uhmarIne Deutsch

tomorrow niht is the belief all
along the water front here today.

ber anil every effort is being made
to have the submersible fully loaded

The report that the Deutschland

WASHINGTON. July 14. Another
complication arose today in the sit

timore of the super-submarine
Deutsehland. The state department
barned unotlicially that the German
government is considering calling to
the attention of the American gov
ernment the existence of an old
treaty forbidding any but port anil
custom officials of one country to
loard the merchant ships of the
other in their otticial capacity.
OMlcials don't believe, however,
tl at Germany will raise an issue
over this question. It was pointed
cut that the visit to the Deutschland
of Capt. Hughes, Lieut. Foster and
Naval Constructor Howard was
made in order to determine whether
the iant submarine is a vessel of
war or a merchantman. As soon
as it was determined that the char
acter of the submarine was that of
a merchantman otticials pointed out
further the naval otlicers left im
mediately. The ruling of the state depart
ment on the status of the vessel is
expected to be made public today.
Otticials insisted today that there is
scarcely the shadow of a doubt that
Mr. I'olk will rule in accordance
with tiie reports of Collector of the

today depends in large measure the
future relations between Mexico and
the Cnited States.
Cpon the works of this man, who
is rabidly anti-American and an
enemy of Minister of War Obregon;
may depend the fate of the Carranza
government.
If there has been any doubt that
Gen. Trevino was about to break

it seemed to disappear today when
otticials at Juarez, acting under Tre

the Carranzista ambassadors have

motions of peace and cooperation

Not the least of these was the
permission to ship supplies over

Trevino's order, which is obeyed
