Russian, French And Brit
ish Munitions Men Confer
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON. July 13 David Lloyd
George, British minister of war, pre
siding t'jday at an Entente allied con
ference on equipment, declared that
the combined offensive of the allies
had wrenched the initiative from the
Germans, never, he trusted, to re
turn. "We have crossed the watershed,"
he said, "and now .victory is begin-'
ning to f:"ow in our direction. This
change is due to the improvement in
our equipment."
The conference was held at thfi
war office and was participated in by
the French minister of munitions.
General Belieoff, assistant minister of
war f Russia, General A. Rall'Olio,
member of the Italian ministry of
war and the new British minister oi
munitions, Edwin S. Montague.
"Since our last conference," saU
Mr. Lloyd-George, " there has been
a considerable change in the fortunes
of the allies. On the date the Great
Champaigne offensive on the west
had just failed to attain its objective
and the French and British armies
had sustained heavy losses without
the achievement of any particular
success. In the east the enemy had
pressed the gallant armies of Russia
back ftome miles, and the. Balkans
had been over run by the Central
Powers.
Allies Hold Whip Hard.
"The overwhelming victories won
by the valiant soldiers of Russia
struck terror into the heart 'of our
foes and those, coupled with the Ce
fense by our French comrades, and
the brave resistance of the Italian
against overwhelming odds in the
t'juthern Alps have changed the
whole complexion of the landscape
"Now, the combined offensive in tb..?
east and west has wrenched the in
itiative out of the hands of the enemy
never, I trust, Vj return to hi
grasp. We have crossed the water
shed and now victory is beginning to
flow in our direction.
Equipment Responsible. '
"Why have our prospects impi'oved?
The answer is, the equipment of our
armies has improved enormously and
is Continuing to improve the Brit
ish navy until recently has observed
more than half the metal work
ers of the country. The task of build
ing new ships and repairing fhe old
ones for the gigantic navy and fitting
and equipping them, accupied the
energies of a million men. M'ost of
our new factories now are complete,
most of the machinery has been set
up. Hundreds of thousands Jf men
and women, hitherto unaccustomed to
metal and chemical work have been
trained for munitions making.
Output to Treble.
"Every n.'jnth we are turning out
hunderds of guns and howitzers, light,
medium and heavy. Our heavy puns
are rolling in at a great rate and we
are turning out nearly twice as much
munitions in a single week and nearly
three times as many heavy shells as
we first did. The new factories and
works we set up have not yet at
tained one third their full capacity
but their output Is r.'iw increasing
with great rapidity. Our main dif
ficulty in organization, construction,
equipment, labor supplv and read
justment have been solved. If em
ployers and workers keep at it with
the same zeal and assiduity as they
have hitherto employed our supplies
will soon be overwhelming.
"I cannot help thinking that the
Improvement in the Russian ammuni
tion has been one of the greatest and
most unoleasant surprises the enemy
has sustained. Still ur task is hut
half aecomnlished. Every great bat
tle furnishes additional proof that
this Is a war of equipment. More am
munition means more victories and
fewer casualties." I

SAN ANTONIO. Juiy 13. Gen

Americans that they can not be good
citizens unless they themselves are
imbued with the principles of Ameri

ing of those interested in the educa
tion of aliens, being held under tne
auspices of the naturalization bureau.
He dwelt at length on the problem of
instructing new citizens, but declar
ed that after all the prime necessity
in such instruction was a realization
of the significance of the American
ism of the instructors.
Unless we are true Americans," he
said, "we cannot infect them with the
spirit of Americanism! unless we our
selves illustrate the ideas of justice
and freedom we can teach nothing to
those who come to us."
"No foreign nation was mentioned
specifically by the president. He de
clared the process of Americanization
must be such a process as will instill
a steaarastness to principle aim
willingness to represent ideal things
rather than material things.
"It t.akes a great deal more tsead
fastness to represent ideal things than
to represent anything else," he con
tinued. "It is easy to lose your tem
per and hard to keep it. It is easy
to strike and sometimes very difficult
to refrain from striking."

said should be so maintained that im
