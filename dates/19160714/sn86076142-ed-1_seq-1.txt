LONDON, July 14. The British advance, is reported by official
sources as apparently constituting the second phase of the great
Anglo-French offensive in the neighborhood of the Somme which
began July 1 over approximately a 20 mile front. The first jphase
carried the British forwurd to and gave them possession of Contala
inaison and Montauban, while the French at the same time moved
their line considerably more forward. v 1
The capture of Longueval and Ba.entin le Grand indicates the
British assault has advanced eastward or northward. C'ontalmaison
or Montauban apparently brought the right wing on a parallel with
the French left and thrust in the salient between Peronne, the
immediate French objective, and

BERLIN, July 14. New and vio
lent battles were fought on both
sides ot the Somme this morning,
says an official bulletin. The British
attacked in a sector ot the Mametz
woods and made repeated efforts to

tles are now progressing.
East of the Meuse in the region
of Verdun the French attempted to
recover territory captured by Ger
mans near the fortress of Souvllle.
The attack was Impeded by a cur
tain of fire. In the vicinity' of Lauffee
the attack was completely repulsed.
The Russian forces, (which had
again entered the German first line
trenches defended by Gen. Von Both-
mer, were ejected with considerable
losseB by a counter attack.
The offensive of the entente allies
on the western "front did not cause
the withdrawal by the Germans of
a single man or gun from the Verdun
front, where the attack on the French
fortress is consistently and success
fully pressed, says the Overseas
agency. ,

The Victor shaft resumed duty this
morning after having been retim-
bered and overhauled to place it In
condition for the heavy service which
will be imposed on it as the chief
supply of ore for the Tonopah Ex
tension mill.' The production will be
divided between the No. 2 and Vic
tor shafts, but the major portion of
the tonnage will come from the latter
outlet. With this addition the Ex
tension will increase its dally tonnage
from 250 to about 810 tons. The new
surface and underground trolley lines
went into commission permanently
thjs morning and now the Extension
has the advantage of the most per
fect system ot haulage and delivery
of any mine in the district. From
the collar of the Victor shaft a
trolley line three quarters of a mile
in length extends to a connection
with the main line running to No. 2
shaft and thence to the mill. Under
ground another trolley line 2000 feet
long connects- the northern -workings
with the Victor shaft. This line is
built on the 1540 level and taps the
five producing veins of the property
below the 1350 level.
M. R. Ward, president of the com
pany, has been here for the fast
three days going over the property
and Intends remaining about a week
completing his survey of the im
provements that have been effected
since his previous visit. t
"I have been spending thre days
looking over the property," President
Ward remarked last night, "and I am
well pleased with the operating con
ditions ot ths mine. For three months
we have been occupied with the
work of repairing the Victor shaft,
which prevented us from hoisting any
ore from that quarter and leaving
the mill to be supplied from No. 2
shaft, which also had to handle all
the waste, taxing it pretty heavily
to keep the mill going. The comple
tion of the repairs on the Victor
enables the company to develop the
orebodies on the lower levels. Since
my last visit here there has not been
any development done below the 1350
level of the No. 2 shaft. We estimate
that the ore supply from each shaft
will now be approximately 150 tons
a day. This will Increase our pro
duction from 250 to 310 tons. a day.
With the opening Of the Victor shaft
the Tonopah Extension . mine will
strike its gait and the stockholders
will begin to' receive the benefit ot
the increased ore reserves. So far
this month the mill heads have been
running around $20."
