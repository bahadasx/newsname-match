To the September Term of the Hraad
4nry Was Jesse Lyles, Ohanred
Willi Angleeoeklng a Krehrht
I ruin Near Hoath Klpley
On .In h 4th.
The easo of Jesse Lyles of this rlty,
charged with anglecocklng a iretgbt
train near South Ripley on July
Fourth waa tried In Police Court yes
terdayl. The trial lasted for two hours
aad a half and ten men were placed
on the witness stand.
The story told by the negro track
walker between Dover and a point
east of South Ripley was that on the
morning of July 4th he noticed Lyles
on a freight train near South Klpley
Lyles waa hanging to the side of the
train and attempting to get off but the
speed of the train prevented this. He
crawled between the cars and reached
dort"n. Immediately the train began tn
slow down and stopped within a very
few scsonds. Lyles Jumped off and waB
seen no more by the negro, Cheney
The trainmen testified thnt the train
'was stopped by anglecoeklng hut at
what point tn the train the men could
not say as the cock was turned on
again almost Immediately. The draw
bars were pulled out of two cars and
the train delayed two hours by the
accident.
Lyles attempted to prove that the
train that he was on as flopped by
a freight la front of their train. This
was knocked In the head upon tne pro
ducing of the C. & 0. record book of
trains passing through which showed
that the last train that had passed
through had been before six o'clock
and this was about nine according to
Lyles and the witnesses.
After hearing the teatlmony of the
witnesses and of the defendent, Judge
Whitaker decided to hold him over to
the next term of the Grand Jury audi
placed his bond at $500. The prosecu
tion seems to have a clear case against
him and If convicted will get a very
heavy sentence.

was Streak on tne sme of the head by
a sledge hammer.
Vance had been worklir? with some
other men In n sand hart st the side
of the cofferdam and hail gone itown
In the "hole." One of th men drop
ped a sledge hammer ofc the coffer
and It bit Vance on the side of the
head a glancing blow Hi- was knock
ed unconscious for about one hour,
although after gaining cmsciousncBB
he resumed work. Bxcfl for a large
cut on the side of bis h. nil. he was
all right today.
Vnnco had a very uarrow escape
from death. Had the hammer, which
weighed sixteen pounds, i alien a few
inches more to the right, his .uil
u m have been crushed as if li
were paplermarhe. TIih hammer fell
over thirty feet as tbat Is the dis
tance from the top of the coffer to
the bottom of the hole.
The workman who djn m ihe ham
mer was not to blame for the acci
dent as It was very dark and he roulii
not see beneath him. Altogether It
was a very narrow escape for Vance.

A Fine Handkerchief Is One of

She may economize elsewhere, but not on the sheerness
and fineness of the little square of linen in her pocket. And
she does not need to economize on this when 25c buys such
handkerchiefs as we sell. As much care and thought go into
them as into the costliest article in this store. One may even
go below 25c and at 10c and 15c be sure of getting handker
chiefs that will be a pleasure to the eye and the touch.
