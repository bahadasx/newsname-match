reached the United Slates employ
ment service, labor department, to
day. The men are being luoblllxed
in southern states ot the belt, and
will move north as the season pro

COAKT GUARD JOINS r ,
IN Ut.NT VOU tfllARK
Washington, July 14. Secretary
McAdoo today ordered instructions
scut to all coast guard aud life sav
ing stations to co-operate In every
way with local officials la minimising
the man-eating shark menace along
the New York and New Jersey coast,
This makes two departments of the
federal government who today are at-
tempting to end , tbe shark danger to
bathers, the bureau ot fisheries of the
department having decided to Investi
gate the situation.
Bureau offlclals said today they
would send no one to the scenes ot
the attack becauae ot the obvious fu
tility of such action.' '
Where officiate aeveral days ago ex
pressed the opinion that all the at
tacks were made by one shark that
had acquired a taste for human flesh,
they were today not ao certain of this
theory. They believed there may be
a number of aharka that have been
driven shoreward because of marked
shortage of waste from ocean liners.
RECOVER
If IB
WAS KILLED OY
Matawan, N. J.; July 14. -Terribly
mangled, the body ot Lester Stlllwell,
victim of the man-eating ahark, was
recovered from tbe waters ot Mata
wan creek early today. Great Jagged
wounds In the abdomen and breast
abowed where the shark's teeth had
closed over, tbe twelve-year-old boy's
body.
The United Press stall correspond
ent waa later permitted to view the
boy's body. Tbe right and left breasts
had been terribly torn. Apparently
the ahark had bitten at the flesh sev
eral times. Another gaping hole was
torn In the boy's abdomen. The flesh
from the calf of one leg was missing
from the bones. Shark experts to
whom these wounds were described
said it waa apparent the man-killer
had made several "strikes" at the
body, and probably each wound rep
resented a separate bite.
Harry Van Cites, an engineer on
the Jersey Central railroad, and Wm,
Clayton, Jr., who had been "patrolling
the bank of the creek, saw the body
rise to the surface not more than
800 feet from where Stlllwell waa at
tacked Wednesday at' 6:20 a. m, to
day, ' They pulled the body ashore
and summoned the county physician.
Later it was removed to a looal un
dertaking establishment. A com
plete autopsy will be performed to
day, Meanwhile physicians who ex
amined the' boy's remains said the
left side of the abdomen had been
ripped opon and the flesh torn from
the right 'breast. The face showed
no contusions,
It was their theory that the ahark
must have been about 1 2 or 15 feet
In length, and the location of the
terrible -wounds shows, they believe,
that the.flsh.seUed the boy aoross
the middle, of the body, rather than
striking at his feet and legs.' All
other oases of attacks by aharka so far
reported have shown that the man-

T.1AN-EATING SHARK
eaters have struck tor the legs of
their victims. ,
News of the recovery of little Les-
jtor Stillwell's body arouBod all resi
dents' ot tbla section . to redoubled
efforts to capture the man-eater.
Searchers after sharks In waters
adjacent to this hamlet numbered
hundreds today. There were profes
sionals and amateurs; fishermen and
Just curious visitors; sportsmen and
scientists the latter seeking positive
proof of ahark attacks, since science
does not yet recognise that a fish
will attack a man. Every sort of
a trap and weapon was in use rifles
saluting cannons, pistols, shotguns,
harpoons, pitchforks, nets, htg hooks,
traps baited with pork and beef.
The mouth of Matawan1 creek is
now completely netted. Volunteers
also worked today to put In a plank
screen to back up "this net and pre
vent escape of the three sharks which
have been seen In the upper reaches
of the 'creek.
All tho searchers after the man
klller.were mighty surprised to learn
how yesterday the New York office
ot two press associations captured the
shark and, after opening him up, dis
covered remains of a human' body.
The first word the workers here got
of the rumor waa from New York.,
Matawan and the surrounding coun
try are in deadly earnest In this shark
hunt and do not relish wild rumors,
so there was great indignation ex
pressed today over tbe author of ea-

Carranza '$ Suggestion That
Board of Three Hen Frca
Each Nation Be Named Is
Approved by the President
Washington, July 14. -Acting Sec
retary Polk submitted to President
Wilson and the cabinet Carr&sta's
suggestion for appointment of a com
mission ot three men from each na
tion to settle the Mexican problem.
It -became known also that President
Wilson heartily approves the plans.
He was expected to put bla lormal
O. K. on it early today before leaving
on the yacht Mayflower for a week
end trip down the Potomac !
' Washington, July 14. A commis
sion of six men, three from each coun
try, la proposed by General Carranza,
as an Investigating body to study and
settle controversies between the
United States and Mexico, It was
learned here today. ' . '
The commissioners' will be directed
to work out a complete series of re
medial steps, probably involving the
patrolling of the -border by troops of
the two countries. They would have
inquisitorial powers, and would be ex
pected to search out the causes of the
difterence, between the people on the
two sides ot the boundary line.
Negotiations would start at some
point on the border, probably at El
Paso or San Antonio, in order that
Mexicans and United States 'military
authorities might give the commis
sion their help. Later the commis
sion would come north to some sum
mer resort Asbury Park or Atlantic
City being favorably considered.
The assembly room at the Com-
menial club was well filled with
water users under the north and
south side ditches Thursday night,
and plans for the Irrigation soason
were made. Dr. Walker presided at
the meeting, with Supt. Hull as sec
retary. H. D. Eismann, 1 who ' has
been in charge of the system since
Mr. Flynn left for Salt Lake city a
couple of weeks ago, stated that the
probable cost of watering for the sea
son would be about 4 per acre. It
was decided to maintain the pumps
till October 1st, If water was required
that late in the season, and C. H.
Demaray was named to handle the
affairs of tbe water users. The
south side ditch needs considerable
repair work before It will carry
water, and the farmers whose lands
come under it have agreed to contri
bute the work to put it In shape.
The pumps on the north Bide are now
delivering water into the ditch, and
the crops are' being irrigated. Farm
ers can arrange with Mr. Demaray or
with the members of the board afor
the use of water. . The pumps and
ditches will be under the manage-'
ment of Mr. Eismann. , '

.El Paso, July 14. Villa baa de
manded tbe surrender of Chihuahua
City, according to a well founded, but
unofficial, report here today. General
Bell, commander at Fort lilba, stated
that he received reliable information
ot tbe defection of General Trevlno,
commandant In Chihuahua City, from

Bell had also heard the reports of

Villa is said to have lniornied Tre

over to the Viilistas ihey would ad

entire army. " U
Villa threatened Trevino and all his
officers with death in case of capture.

cars of provisions was allowed to go
to Colonla Dublaa. Trevino gave no
explanation of his previous orders,
whlah led to charges that his policy
was in keeping with the new Vil
lista movement to bring on war with
the United States and overthrow Car
ranaa In northern Mexico.
This is the "grave news" declared
on the best authority to have been
transmitted to Washington and re
flected in the large concentration of
militia here. With the arrival of
500 Massachusetts militia recrulta
from Framlngbam today there were
24,000 national guardsmen In the El
Paso district Other state contingents
ordered to El Paso will bring the
total to 50,000. it is believed. Gov
ernment agents have been Instructed
from Washington to be on the look
out against aid going to Villa from
the United States. Former Viilistas
are under close surveillance. . .Steps
have been taken to prevent smuggling
ot arms and ammunition across tbe
Big Bend border. General Bell said
today more militia probably would
be moved there shortly. .
