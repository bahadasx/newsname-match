STATE IN FINAL PLEA
Attorney Joslyn Making the
Last Address Will Not
Ask Death Penalty.
Watikegan. TIL, July 11. Attor
ney Joslyn hctran speaking at 2:20
o'clock. The court room was
tl.H'kt !.
ir. Joslyn intimated early in
his remarks that he would not ask
the death penalty.
Waukegan. 111., July 14. The final
piea for the acquittal of "William H.
Orpot on the charge of murdering
Marian. Lambert was resumed by
Jarr.es H. Wilkerson. his senior coun
sel, at the opening of court today. Mr.
Wilkerson will be followed by David
R. Joslyn, special prosecutor aiding
State's Attorney Daily, who will make
the state's final plea.
Mr. Wilkerson said the keystones
on which the state bases its case have
been swept away and msi.-ted that
there was not a bit of evidence left
which would not be more reasonably
recor.ciit-d with Orpet's innocence
than with guilt.
Mr. Wilkerson also attacked the
methods employed by the state, stat
ing that the cross examination was
brutal and that if the state had plac
ed any credence on the spots found
on the girl's coat that it would not
have waited three months to give them
significance.
At the noon recess today there was
jt--eiM5i"r&p'-Hv.k- the
case would bo in the hands of the "jury
tonight.
Attorney Joslyn of the prosecution
began speaking this afternoon. He
told reporters he expected to finish
before o'clock. This would consign
the case to the jury by 7 o'clock.
HI-tury of Case.
The case of Marian Lambert and
William H. Orpet in the course of its
delopment became one of the most
perplexing in the annals of criminal
history. Motive paralleled motive, ac
tion paralleled action, opportunity
paralieivd opportunity until the marks
of n.urd r and of suicide, became sub
stantially a,s one.
In the end the guilt or innocence
of the defendant, so far as the adduc
tion of actual fact was concerned,
went to the jury on the mystifying
niceties of chemical analysis and Or
pet's own compromising conduct. The
mystery attracted unusual interest in
all parts of the Timed States and
Canada.
Ttia! of the case, including selec
tion of a jury, occupied the better part
of two months. There appeared in
evidence 44 letters writ" vv C- -t
to Marian over a period o" a "ear: bot-tb-s
and boxes containin?, samp 3 of

COMBS AND HAIR
BRUSHES RUMPLE
STATE OFFICIAL
State Secretary Testifies in Munro Suit
That He Spent S.1,400 for Tonsor
ial Equipment.
Springfield, 111., July 14. "Whether
the appearance of the 49th general as
sembly of Illinois indicated that it was
in need of combs and hair brushes and
whether the assembly as a body ever
used the combs and hair brushes fur
nished by the state were among the
questions upon which Attorney F. S.
Munro based his examinations of Sec
retary of State Stevenson in a hearing
on one of the Fergus suits here today.
The secretary of state, after testify
ing that he had spent $3,400 for combs,
brushes, pocket knives, fountain pens,
card cases, etc., all of which were pre
sented "to the general assembly," said
thai, lie bad not- noticeft'r.rh i.fceri jof
combs and bru.Vr.es in this particular
assembly, but had noticed that need in
preceding ones, lie testified that he
did not see the general assembly as a
whole use the combs and brushes be
cause he was "otherwise engaged."
Attorney Munro attempted to estab
lish the fact, as claimed in the Fergus
petition, that the combs, brushes,
knives and pens were presented to and
used by the members of the legislature
individually, but Secretary Stevenson
answered every question along that
line bv saying the merchandise was
presented to the postmistress of the
house and senate for those bodies as
wholes.
During a recess in the court pro
ceeding, Munro and the attorneys for
the deieandants engaged in a serious
discussion as to the right of the gen
eral assembly to appropriate funds for
shaving and bathing itself and after
that -s to how the general assembly
could shave and bathe itself as a body.
In testifying that he had paid $1,219
to the Patitagraph Stationery Co., for
fountain pens, combs, brushes, and
other similar articles. Secretary Stev
enson stated that neither he nor any
; :.:n.'. . of '.is "i . ;'y '"-- w '
"n ."?c? '"l the ationery com
pany. His wife, Mr. Stevenson said,
was one of the owners of The Pauta
graph, a newspaper which was not
connected with the stationery company
of the same name.
"What authority did you have for
buying the combs, brushes, etc?" Mun
ro asked. . .
"I was following a well established
precedent," the secretary answered.
"Did vou ever hear of a resolution
or order by the general assembly au
thorizing or requesting you to buy
such things?" was the next Question.
"No, but I looked upon it as part of
the routine of my office to supply those
incidentals," was the answer.
"From whom did you learn of that
precedent."
-By my own observation, ' the secre
tarv answered. .
Munroe then asked the witness if it
wa-s true that the secretary of state
had paid $14li for 220 wooden boxes
used by the legislators to send home
stationery and other things from their
desks Mr. Stevenson said he had
bought the boxes but he understood
they were to be used for shipping a
collection of pamphlets to legislators.
This was the only case in which the
secretary testified "he took it" that
goods bought by state funds were de
livered to legislators personally and
not to the assembly as a body.
Among the witnesses scheduled to
appear today were Secretary Steven
son. Auditor Urady. Rufus Potts, super
intendent of the state insurance de
partment, and 1 inley F. Hell, secretary
of the legislative reference bureau.
Governor Dunne who also has been
scheduled as a witness, departed this
morning for La Salle to investigate the
cement workers' strike.

German Sub
Is to Leave
When Ready
"Washington, July 14. An advisory
report on the status of the German
merchant submarine Deutschland,
submitted to Acting Secretary Polk
today by the government neutrality
board, is understood to hold that the
vessel is a peaceful merchant craft
and entitled to all privileges as .such.
Indications now are that the state
department will make no formal an
nouncement concerning the submarine
but that the treasury department will
be advised to permit her to clear and
sail from Baltimore whenever her
captain desires to start on his return
voyage.
Baltimore, Md., July 14. Silence
continues as to the date of departure
of tho supersubmarine Deutschland.
The tug Timmons, which met her at
the capes and convoyed her to Bal
timore, remains fastened at the pier.
She is so close to the submarine it
would probably would take only 10
minutes to get the latter from the
mooring into open water.
A big hydroaeroplane, practically
completed, is stored on the pier of
the Eastern Forwarding company,
where the. Deutschland is docked. It
was intimated that the flying boat will
scout around the. capes before the
submarine makes her dash for the At
lantic. The manner in which the
Deutschland has been cleared of ev
erything she brought over, even pig
iron ballast, leads to the belief she
would return to Germany heavily
laden. Captain Koenig ridiculed the
report from Amsterdam that the prin
cipal object of the Deutschland's voy
age was to convey a consignment of
diamonds. .
G. Prusse of the submarine's crew
made application to the local immi

SHARK HUNTING
GROWS POPULAR
As Resnlt of Recent Raids by Man
Fating Monsters New Jersey Folk
Turn Out in Crowds.
Washington, July 11. Tragic
stories of attacks by sharks upon
bathers along the .New Jersey
coast were discussed at today's
meeting of the cabinet. Later
Secretary McAdoo announced that
the coast gaurd would be ordered
to do what it could toward clear
ing the coast of dangerous fish
and preventing further loss of
life.
Instructions were sent by the treas
ury department both to the coast
guard cutters and life saving stations.
New York, July 14. Shrak hunting
or fishing suddenly has become a
popular sport along the New Jersey
coast in the waters of New York bay
and along the ocean side of Long Is
land as a result of the recent raids by
man eating monsters from southern
waters which have killed four persons.
Reports of the sighting or killing of
sharks are made almost hourly and
some fithermen are bringing in big
fish they have killed. Only a few of
these, however, are described as man
killers. One shark was killed near
Fairfield, Conn.
) Shark hunters at Matawan creek,
N. J., believe they have the shark that
killed a man ami a boy penned up in
the creek behind a series of wire nets
which have been strung across the
creek at intervals from its mouth to
the scene of the tragedy IB miles from
the entrance. Men armed with shot
guns, ritles and harpoons are patroll
ing the waters of the creek again.
At almost low tide today the body of
Lester Stillwell was found in the
creek about 200 feet from the spot
where he disappeared alter being at
tacked by the shark. The body had
been bitten nearly jn two above the
waist line.
Josepii Dunn, the boy whose leg
was terribly torn by the invader of
Matawan creek, is in a critical condi
tion in a New Brunswick, N. J., hos
pital. John T. Nichols, assistant curator of
fishes of the American Museum of
Natural history, who went to Mata
wan to investigate the tragedy there
said he believed the killing was done
by a white shark or tiger shark, both
of which are warm water fishes and
rarely seen north of Capt Hatteras.
Fishermen, however, believe that the
man eaters are of the ordinary type of
sharks which have been made raven
ous by scarcity of food.
Captain Smith of the oil tank steam
er Standard, which reached here to
day from Tuxpam, Mexico, r portel
that early this morning when off Bar
negat on the Jersey coast, an immense
school of sharks was sighted. Some of
them were enormous in size, the cap
tain declared.

London, July 11, (12:2- p. m.
At daylight this morning the Brit
ish, resuming the offensive north
of the Somme, attacked the Ger
man second line defenses and ac
cording to the report of their com
mander, General Sir Ron trim
Ilaig, succeeded. In penetrating
them on a front of four miles.
Press dispatches from the front
add that the villages of Baentin-Le-Grund
and Longueval, north of
3Iontauban and the remaining
portion of Trones wood were
taken by the British
While it was expected the British
would not allow any great length of
time to elapse before continuing their
operations it was hardly believed the.
second German would, be attackeil
after only one day of artillery pre
paration; for it was only the day be
fore yesterday that they completed
capture of the first line in the region
between Hardecourt and Ovillers. The
direction of the attack, too, was some
thing of a surprise, for Instead of
pushing on toward Gambles, General
Ilaig chose to attack the flank of tho
Germans who faced Contalmaison and
OvMlers and those who still occupy
Pozieres.
Is Strategic Position.
The advance to Longueval and
Bazentin-tLe-Grand, If a.eompllshcd,
gives the British possession of import
ant roads, which have been a great
help to the Germans In supplying
their army directly south of the Ancro
river.
News of the British success was re
ceived in London with the greatest
enthusiasm. It was given added weight
to the request of the government to
workmen to forego the August holi
days o that the army may bo kept
well supplied with munitions.
There was no news this morning of
important developments on tho re
mainder of the western front but at
last accounts the French were prepar
ing to resume their offensive south of
the Somme, while' the Germans wore
still hammering at the defenses of
Verdun.
Busstans Less Acllvft.
The Russians have made no notice
able advance on any part of their front
since they gained the Sfokbod river,
where the struggle continues desper
ately. The right bank apparently has
now been cleared of Germans but it Is
not known here whether the crossings
made by the Russians have given them
a firm fooling on the left bank. Gen
eral von Pot Inner, having received re
inforcements, has succeeded in holding
the Russians in Gulicia but with De
latyn in Ihe hands of the Ku.sians,
they possess an advantage from
which further success is e xpected.
The operations in the Caucasus are
becoming more and more important.
After suffering heavy losses in their
counter offensive, the Turks are now
being pressed back towards Bailmrt
and Krzignan, while in Persia the Rus
sians have brought up reinforcement j
to meet the Turks who drove them
from Kermanshah.
