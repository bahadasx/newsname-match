STATE ADVOCATED
League Caucus This Week Prob­
ably Will Endorse Calling of
Special Assembly
WOULD PAVE WAY FOR
PROGRESSIVE MEASURES
Idea is to so Revise Constitution
as to Carry out Org&niza
tion's Program
The convening of a constitutional
convention March 1, 1917, will be the
most important matter to be discussed
at the Non-Partisan league caucus to
be held here this week.
Announcement to this effect was
made today by a prominent local
league leader.
Except by an occasional amend­
ment, North Dakota's constitution has
undergone little change sine# its adop­
tion by the first constitutional conven­
tion, provided for in the enabling act
approved by congress February 22,
1889. Delegates to this convention
were elected in May, 1889, to the num­
ber of 75, and they assembled in Bis­
marck and organized July 4,188®. The
constitution which they framed was
adopted October 1, 1889, by a vote of
27,441 to 8,107.
To Pave the Way.
The purpose for which the new con­
stitutional convention is proposed is
a general revision of the constitution
which will pave the way for the ultra
progressive program adopted by the
Non-Patisan league and approved by a
majority of members of both houses
of the Fifteenth general assembly.
If a bill providing for the assembling
of a constitutional convention passes
both houses, the governor may then by
proclamation call a special election for
the selection of delegates to the con­
vention. The results of the delibera­
tions of these delegates will be em­
bodied in a proposed draft of a new
constitution, which must be published
for three months and then submitted
to a vote of the people, and which, up­
on approval of a majority of the elect­
ors voting will be referred to the legis­
lative assembly to be chosen at the
next general election, with whose
agreement to each: of its. articles the
constitution will fee adopted.

SWEDEN TO ACT
(Associated Press)
Pope Benedict, according to reports
today, in speaking^ to Cardinal Gas
parri, cabling the secretary of state,
regarding the president's note to bel­
ligerents, said:
"It is a document showing the hon­
esty, justice and
far-sightedness
of the
American president."
A Havas dispatch from Berne says
that it is believed in certain circles
there that the Swedish government is
about to approach the belligerents on
the subject of peace in the same way
as the Swiss president.
The JournalGedecunova of Geneva,
discussing the note sent by Present
Wilson to the belligerent powers, gives
warm praise to the president.
"Whatever results Wilson obtains,"
the Journal Says, "we Swiss and other
neutrals must thank this good repub­
lican and salute him with respect.
President Wilson has dared to propose
something precise in order to realize
his specific aspirations. He has caus­
ed, during this dark Christmas, a
gleam of hope in a gloomy sky."

One Hundred Poor Children Fed
at Van Horn Cafe—Kettles
Net $123.33
Candles were kindled in scores of
Bismarck homes last evening and
hundreds of "kiddies" were made hap­
py this morning, when they arose
early and beheld 'their stockings
chucked plum full. It was a great
Christmas morning in the homes. On
the streets scarcely a soul moved.
'Passing the various homes early
this morning, little tots in their paja­
mas could be seen romping and play­
ing on the floor in the light* at the
tree with their rocking horse, their
doll or some other gift that 'Santa
left in his trip through the city last
evening.
Storm Ushers Great Day In.
A snowstorm ushered Christmas in­
to Bismarck and the state. Snow flur­
ries, driven hy a^stiff northeast wind,
dressed the residences and the busi­
ness houses of the city in a holiday
suit* of white, adding to the spirit of
the Jay. Few Christmas bells were
to ibe heard on the streets. Instead,
automobiles flitted 'by, carrying guests
to the different homes where they
spent the day. The lobbies of the
leading hotels seemed deserted. To­
night a transition, however, will 'be
noted, when Christmas throngs will
partake of the Christmas dinners, big
preparations having been made both
at the Grand Pacific, the McKenzie
and Van Horn.
Many Christmas Eve Parties.
Many Christmas Eve parties were
held in the various homes of the city,
and exercises held in the churches
and at the state penitentiary. At
the state institution some 222 con­
victs assembled for more than an
hour last night and celebrated the
birth of the Christ Child. At the ho­
tels were several parties. In many
of the cities of the state, such as
Fargo, Valley City, Mandan, 'Minot
and other points municipal exercises
were held, the attendance being some­
what checked iby the cold «*vave. On
the iNorthern Pacific Xo. 1, which ar­
rived at ®:05 this morning, due in
here at 11:35 last evening, Santa
Claus romped, with the travelers in
the Pullmans and the dining cars. He
was also aboard train No. S, which
pulled in here at 1:20 o'clock this at
ternoon, and has wired ahead that
he will be in train No. 4, due at 4:40
o'clock.
The Poor Enjoy Big Spread.
One hundred little tots from the
poor families, and among them were
newsies and orphans, piled into the
big auto bus owned by McGillis &
Wallace of the Van Horn hotel, early
this afternoon, and were conveyed in
dozen lots to the Van Horn cafeteria
under the direction of Assistant Cap­
tain Rhody of the Salvation army,
where they tucked napkins under
their chins and "filled" up on soup,
roast turkey, cranberries, bread, ice
cream and coffee. That was the me­
nu provided for the children of the
poor iby the cafe management. Not
a tot in the city was slighted. Jimmy
and Mary iboth rubbed their "tum­
mies" as thep left the cafe, both ad­
mitting that "it was some feed." A
few of the youngsters didn't forget
to show their appreciation, and de­
spite the big load they carried, tod­
dled up to Bougas brothers and ex­
pressed their thanks and wished 'em
a Merry Christmas. But some of the
"kids" were too full to utter another
word. The management understood
and they were pardoned.
Captain Murphy as Santa.
Captain James Murphy of the Sal­
vation army was the Santa Claus of
the hour. 'Last night he personally
directed the distribution of 31 baskets
to the needy, 21 pairs of shoes and
eight pairs of rubbers also, a large
amount of stockings and underwear.
Toys, candies, nuts and fruit accom­
panied the baskets for the children in
the families. Tonight a Christmas
tree program will be held at the 'bar­
racks and an interestig program
will be rendered. Santa Claus will be

Senator King Has Been Success as
Merchant Prater, Varnum

Burleigh county has every reason to
expect good, constructive servicc from
its legislative delegation to tho Fif­
teenth general assembly. The four
men who were swept .to^.ictory by
such tremendous majorities last No­
vember are known as loyal citizens of
the slope men of experience, and of
sound knowledge of the practical
needs of their districts.
Expression of Confidence.
The confidence which their fellow
citizens repose in them was indicated
at the election, when Carol D. King
of Menoken received 1,790 votes for
the state senate to 528 for:his oppon­
ent. For representatives, L. D. Bailey
of Moffit polled 1,760 Frank G. Prater
of Arena, 1,924, and George N. Var­
num, 1,724, while the highest vote re­
ceived by any of their opponents was
492.
Farming and Business.
Each of the four Burleigh county
legislators is a practical, successful
farmer. Senator Carol D. King's farm
near Menoken is one of the finest in
the county. Representative Varnum
has a splendid place near the same vil­
lage, and Representative Frank G.
Prater is known as one of the most
progressive and'successful agricultur­
ists of the Arena region. Representa­
tive L. D. Bailey came to Burleigh
county at a date when the buffalo still
disputed possession, and he has been
actively engaged in farming ever since.
All of these men have also been
prominent in Farmers' union or other
co-operative movements. They have
given much study to the business sit­
uation in their district and state, and
when they come to vote upon matters
involving commerce and transporta
tion they may be depended upon to
use good judgment.

(By United Press.)
El Paso, Texas, Dec. 2.",.—An Amer­
ican here, known as a close friend of
Francisco Villa, claimed yesterday
that he had received information that
when Villa's forces occupied Torre
on, the bandit chief gave orders to
commanders not to harm lives and
property of foreigners. Villa is not at
Torreon in person, but was said to be
in the vicinity of Bermejillo.
A clash between forces of General
Jose Murguia and General Gonzales
is feared. Christmas celebration is
responsible for much intoxication at
Juarez and feeling 'between the two
commands is bitter. The two generals
are hostile and before the celebra
tions are over, trouble, it is feared
will result.

GREMANS CHY "KAMERAD"
AS SOLDIERS MAKE CHARGE
Believed That New Phase of Man­

Tactics
With the British armV in advance
December '24, via London Dec. 25.—
(From a staff correspondent of the As­
sociated Press). North of Arras cer­
tain Canadian troops have just accom­
plished what the British officers de­
clare marks a new phase in trench
warfare. With a raid race, they suc­
ceeded in putting out of action, tem­
porarily at least, an entire battalion of
German infantry.
Take Prisoners.
They took 59 prisoners, including
one commissioned officer, and estimat­
ed that they killed 150 Germans in
dug-outs which were blown to atoms
after their occupants refused to sur­
render. The Canadian losses were ex­
tremely light. The raid took place at
three o'clock in the afternoon on a
front of 400 yards. The German pris­
oners admit that they were taken com­
pletely by surprise.
The officer captured said he was con­
vinced something was about to hap­
pen, but believed the attack was com­
ing on Christmas eve. He reported to
the higher command but received no
report. The Canadians, from the
plains of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and
Alberta, established themselves well
forward so that when the artillery
ceased their preparatory Are they were
in the front line trenches in less than
two minutes. The offices in command,
who were reporting the raid by tele­
phone, said "they're off," before he had
time to say "they're in." Consterna­
tion reigned among the Germans, who
scrambled for the saps and dug-outs
leading to the rear trenches, while the
Canadians pelted them with hand
grenades.
Cry "Kamerad."
Caught
unprepared, many Germans
in the front line offered no resistance,
but threw up their hands with cries
of "Kamerad." Others were taken as
they fled for the second and third line
before the Canadians pushed on to the
second trenches.
About 20 dug-outs were destroyed by
Canadians, several with bombs cap­
tured from the Germans. One of the
officers engaged said:
"As we entered the trenches, many
Germans broke for the dug-outs.
Many who did were subsequently well
cared for. Each of our men were given
definite instructions for his precise at­
tack and the mass of the enemies'
trenches, which proved absolutely cor­
rect. Each man knew every detail of
the proposed operation. They enter­
ed the fight with great cheers. When
they came out two hours later, they
were singing and as happy as school­
boys on a holiday. The newness and
dispatch with which the raid was car­
ried out were unique. The artillery
co
operation of the British guns work­
ed to perfection. Beautifully placed
curtains of fire prepared our advance
and creeping forward, protected us, as
they proceeded to absolutely demolish
the enemy's trenches. The program
had given the men an hour and a half
for the work, but the cleanout was ac­
complished within an hour and ten
minutes
and the raiders signaled they
were ready to return to their own
trenches.

Pope Makes
Yuletide Plea
For Peace
Rome, Dec. 25.—Pope Benedict
made a plea for peace in his ad
dress at the Christmas reception
to the sacred college. Referring
to the message of Bethlehem, the
pope said: "Good will among
men", was the essential condition
toward obtaining that "just and
durable peace" which must put
an end to the horrors of the pres­
ent war.
The pope urged those in power
to hear the voice of the sacred
college appealing to them to end
the struggles of the people and
open their ears to the admonition
of the Father of the Christian
family.
PEACE APPEAL
Copy of the Note Sent Belliger­
ents Received at the White
House
TO CONSIDER ITSELF
HAPPY IF COULD ACT"
(By United Press.)
Washington, Dec. 25.—Switzerland,
in a note to the warring powers, has
announced her support of President
Wilson's appeal for the discussion of
peace terms. The note says that the
Swiss government would consider it­
self "happy' if "it could act in any
way, no matter how modest a way, for
the rapprochement of the peoples now
engaged in the struggle and for last­
ing 'peace."
Sent to White House.
The note was sent to ibelligerents
yesterday by the Swiss federal coun­
cil. Dri Paul Ritter, minister of Swit­
zerland to the United States, present­
ed the copy to the White House.
Secretary Lansing made the note
public last night, and it is as follows:
Lauds the President.
"The President of the 'United States
of America, guided by warm friend­
ship, desires hostilities soon to come
to an end and has said that he has
for considerable time been in touch
with conditions. He has had the kind­
ness to apprise the Federal council
of the peace note sent to the igovern
ments of the Teutonic and the Allied
Powers. In this note he discusses the
great desiraibiltiy of international
agreement for the purpose of avoiding
effectively and permanently the occur­
rences of catastrophes such as the
one the people are suffering today.
"In this connection, he lays partic­
ular stress on the necessity for 'bring­
ing about the end of the war. With­
out making peace proposals himself,
or offering mediation, he confines him­
self to sounding whether mankind
may hope to approach the haven of
peace.
Mighty Echo in Switzerland.
"Most meritorious is the personal
initiative of President Wilson and it
will find a mighty echo in Switzer­
land. True to obligations arising, ob­
serving strictest neutrality, united 'by
the same friendship to the states of
both warring groups of powers, sit­
uated like an island amid the seeth­
ing waves fthe terrible world war,
with Its ideals and material interests
jeopardized and violated, our country
is filled with a deep longing for peace
and ready to assist by its small means
to stop the endless suffering caused
by the war and brought before its
epes by daily contact with the in­
terne, the horribly wounded and those
expelled. It is ready to establish a
foundation for the beneficial co-opera­
tion of the people.
Happy If It Could Act.
"Swiss Federal council is therefore
glad to seize the opportunity to sup­
port the efforts of the president of
the United States. It would consider
itself happy if it could act, no matter
how modestly, for the rapprochement
of the people now engaged in the
struggle in order to reach everlasting
peace."

celebration was the part taken by twe
of the largest American battleships*
the New York and the Pennsylvania,
the crews of which played Santa Claus
at the celebration of the children. Be*

The Christmas observance began in
this city last night with the flashing
into life of the great "Tree of Light"
in Madison Square Garden. At milk
night prayers for world peace were of*
fered at mass in the Roman Catholic
churches. With Christmas trees in po­
lice stations, the police acted as Santa
Clauses to approximately 25,000 chil­

AT WHITE*HOUSE.
(Associated Press)
Washington, Dec. 25.—Two young*

Christmas Tree.
A heavily laden Christn.
stood on the second floor,
around it the family gathered, «.
presents were exchanged among t.
grown ups and Santa Claus distribute^

ried employe of the White House had-,
a turkey, the gift of the president.
President Wilson was up early and
joined little Josephine Cothran,' his
grandniece, who had discovered the
large Christmas tree in the White
House, laden with presents mostly for
her. Soon, the entire party spending
Christinas with the president and Mrs.
Wilson were gathered in the library
and the exchange of presents follow­
ed. Breakfast at the White House was
a joyous affair, with Josephine Cothran
continually jumping up to rush back ta
her gifts.
Mrs. Wilson attended church alone,
and the president remained at the
White House to play with his grand*
niece. During the morning, Secretary
and Mrs. McAdoo, with Ellen McAdoo
and several other relatives, visited the

tivities. The president had all three
of his daughters with him for the first
time in months.
