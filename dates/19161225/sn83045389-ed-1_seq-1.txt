A day of sunshine -a rarity in
ber on tlii* British front ? recently
mused a temporary revival of activity
, among the aviator.", presented a spe.
tarlft which a few yepr.s ago could have
lived only In the imaginutSon.

While the < Jerman machines were
* fctill over their own lln?s the- British
antiaircraft cunnf.n, known as
"arehlea," began to speak. There uas
" sharp, angry crack. A nu.inmt later
* shrapnel shell burst lm? ,1 wM'.e
puff ball Just In the path of the oncom
Insr airplanes. At diM the white fink
of powder smoke t?o larger
than a plnhead, hut It soon spread un
til it appeared as an exa ggera.te.d toy
balloon and floated ay l??.|jy against
the sky.
Then ther<, was another puff, and
then another, until It seemed that half
a hundred "ar< hleS" must he going,
and the sky became a fretwork of
white smoke balls, each one marking
a spot where a brcakintc fhetl had
showered Its leaden bullets upon the
fast-traveling Germans. Plunging in
and out among the exploded shrapnel.
, ,h< approaching airplanes left a trail
of flecks and powder puffs in their
wakes, l/p and up through ihe danger
rone of th?lr own puns the British
aviators climbed eagerly to the tight.
TI.e distant hum of the hostile motors
now could be heard, mingled with the
louder, bee-liki- drone of the English
machine* iin,j between the s<-ar<-e]y
perceptible intervals of the "arehlea" ??
fire came the staccato notes of the ma
chine guns The British airmen had
opened fire before reaching th> level

' Nr>w the British machines began to
? lose in from various directions, and

started for their own linen. The some
what precipitate retreat was marked
by the same trail of shelMre as had
the approach.

Airplanes are never so much like
birds as when they meet in an aerial
combat. They dart. dash, circle, turn
and swoop like so many feathered war
riors. and often the battles rage at
such high altitudes that the machines
, become all but invisible.
Again there will be a tight among
the cloud* when the more darinp avia
tors mak<* startling plunges through
the Intervening mist to cat^h their op
ponents unawares. Always there is
Kreat maneuvering for position, and
? tho spectators ar< fllled with wonder
at what the modern airplane can do
even to excelling the birds in their
own element by flying upside down.
Most of the fighting aviators en.
cleaver to get "on the other fellow's
tail." This means a position above and
slightly behind the adversary, where
ono can Art down into him Others,
however, prefer to attack from a posi
tion nin-o.N'. directly underneath, think
ing they have a steadier tiring plat
form In climbing than in diving.
I he latter-day machines have such
wonderful Stability that they can only
be brought down by direct hits, kill
ing the pilot or pier<*inp the petrol
tank, in whf.'h latter event the alr
? plane'generally catches tire and falls
In a blazing spiral. "Archie" shells
frequently blow airplanes out of line
by making many punctures in their
wings, but the machines thus damag
ed generally are brought safely home.
TliniLLIMr CHAI'TIZHS
IN WOltl.I) COXn.HT
When the history of aviation in the
present wa. ? Is written. It will con
tain some of the most thrilling chap
ters of the strange world conflict. The
British flying corps, which grew front
i almost nothing at the beginning of th*
war. already has established records
of daring and attainment which even
in the colorless ofllcial reports of the
corps read like fiction. Recently there
have been tights on the British fronts
In which from sixty to eighty machines
were encaged. Such battles begin with
individual fights and gradually develop
into what the aviators term a "gen
eral melee" as reinforcements arrive
from hoth sides.
There have been high as ninety
six separate and distinct fights In a
single day on this front alone. Xear
the point where the British and French
lines Join there have been fights In
which the French hav? come to the
assistance of the Knglish and the Kng
11 sh have gone to the assistance of the
French to help defeat the Germans
There, hnvo been numerops engage
ments in which British aviators have
closed within twenty yards of their
adversary, firing polntblank into him.
There have bron both French and Brit
ish instances of aviators deliberately
^.crashing into a t'lermnn. sending him
^tlrlown. After one instance of that sort
British avlatcr brought his, ma
chine down with only one wing. Me

When the song was finished and the'

lights of the tree were turned on. The
beams of the guiding star were put

anri more brilliant star directly over
the tree. A thrill Of pleasure "and a

crowd. Tall and symmetrical, the tree
glowed with hundreds of red. purple,

The crowd was easily the largest that !
