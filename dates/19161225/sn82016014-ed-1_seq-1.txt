! "Mail will be from two to ten days

reasons for the great delay is that

"It will take at least a week for the

HIGH OLD TIME!
S. Boys in Mexico Celebrate in
Varied Fashion.
El Valle, San Bueno, Ventura, Chi
huahua, Mex., Dec. 25 By wireless to
Columbus, N. M., Dec. 25. There was
a Fourth of July tinge to the Christ
mas celebration at this camp, which
is the extreme southern point of the
American expedition's line. Nearly
$300 worth of fireworks, set off
Christmas eve, consoled the 4.000 sol
diers in camp for their inability to
hang up stockings and brought some
thing akin to alarm to the residents of
El Valle and the Mexicans inhabiting
the fringe of adobe huts that surround
the camp.
Christmas day itself is full to over
flowing with amusements. They va
ried from Christmas carols which -the
Fifth cavalry band played at the
headquarters of each organization im
mediately after reveille, to a bountiful
spread at noon and a bull fight in the
afternoon.
Have Football Game.
The morning was given over to
sports. A football team chosen from
the cavalry and artillery in camp
played a closely contested game with
an eleven from the infantry and en
gineers, the victors receiving a prize
of $25 donated by Col. W. H. Allaire,
camp commander; there were three
horse and two mule races, the latter
for enlisted men; and those who pre
ferred more unusual sports were per
mitted to attend a bull fight and a
cocking main arranged by Mexican
promoters.
Red Cross presents and others re
ceived by the men from the states
were distributed at the special noon
dinner for which antelope, turkey,
chicken and wild duck had been se
cured. A holiday moving picture program
and band concert brought the celebra
tion to a close. Truck train drivers
and guards who arrived in camp yes
terday were guests of the command
at the dinner and amusements.
KLINE TO RETIRE
Rock Island Right-of-Way Agent Will
Give l'p Position.
E. W. Kline, right-of-way agent for !
the Rock Island since the road was J
organized, who has had his headquar- j
ters at Topeka for more than thirty j
years, will retire from active service j
with the road on January 1, and will (
devote his time to private business, j
He will be retired on pension by the
company on account of long and j
faithful service. i
Kline located much of the right- '
of-way for the Rock Island thru Kan- j
sas, and in Topeka. When the Kock
Island was the Chicago, Kansas &
Nebraska Railway company, Mr.
Kline was city clerk of Trenton, Mo.
Believing in the prospect of the new
railroad, which was then just starting
construction west of the Mississippi,
Mr. Kline resigned his position and
entered the employ of the road in
charge of the town and land accounts
in the office of C. F. Jilson, then
treasurer of the company at Atchison.
The offices were moved to Topeka
in 1887, Mr. Kline coming here at
that time. He later was appointed to
the management of the Land and
Town companies of the road, and also
to be special right-of-way agent, a po
sition he has held ever since that time.
In 1902 he was appointed president
and secretary of the Land and Town
company and continued his work as
special right-of-way agent, with head
quarters still in Topeka. He has held
the latter position up to this time.
Mr. Kline's home is at 1188 Col
lege avenue, and he plans to remain
there.
ao announcement of the appoint
ment of a successor has been made by
the company.

CELEBRATES HER
106TH CHRISTMAS,
HALE AND HEARTY
New York, Dec. . 25. Surrounded
by a large proportion of her score or
more of grand and great-grandchild-
ren from Brooklyn and Philadelphia,
Mrs. Alice Bennett celebrated her
106th Christmas at her home in
Brooklyn today. Mrs. Bennett was 105
years old yesterday. After helping
prepare breakfast and reading the pam
per without the use of spectacles, she
walked five blocks to church and
home again at the end of the service.
The home observance lasted until mid
night. Today she helped stuff a 25
pound turkey and according to her d
scendents, was the "life of the Christ
mas party."
NO WAR VACATION
i
o Christmas Respite i
Trenches of Europe. j '
Vigorous Fighting Reported of
All Battle Fronts.
London, Dec. 25. Not een Chrisl
mas cheer stopped war's maiming to
day. Reports from every front dis
closed slight letup in the business of
killing. London itself celebrated, but
with a cheer tinged with sorrow for
loved ones lost and a reconsecration
for the future. London't main man
ifestation of the Christmas spirit waas
furnished in the elabor- te arrange
ments made to give furloughed Tom
mies a real taste of cheer and home
comforts. There were thousands of
khaki-clad warriors who came over
from France to spend the holiday at
home or, if not at home, in friendly
hands. '
Snow made real t Christmas sur
roundings on nearly every front. It
traced a covering of the forces in the
Vosges in the western front. It in
terposed a natural obstacle to unlim
ited fighting on the east. High up in
the Carpathians the Russians and
Germans were locked ; and south, in
the dazzling whiteness of the peaks of
the Alps, the Italians and Austrians
still fought each other from trenches
dizzily planted on height and In val-;
ley. In Macedonia both sides .were
"snowed in."
Drive on Dobrudja.
Dispatches from Rumania and Do
brudja did not detail the weather, but
indicated perhaps the most vigorous
of all warfare of the day in progress.
Field Marshal von Mackensen has
switched from his drive of the Teu
tonic troops north from" Bucharest, jto
take charge of a new and violent of
fensive directed against the Russians
in Dobrudj
Here in London, nearly' all of
Britain's officials stuck closely at
their desks planning ahead. Christ
mas usually found all pf this holiday
vacationing in the past but it was
symbolical of the new order, in
stalled by Premier Lloyd-George, that
personal comfort this year came sec
ond to the nation's needs and the of
ficials, for the most part, were right
on the job. Premier Lloyd-George
himself set an example in this regard,
foregoing all pleas of his family to
spend a Christmas at his home in
Wales. He expects to accomplish
some work at his office today. So do
most of the other cabinet officers. -

HAD A JBIG TRADE
Topeka Stores Did an Unusual
ly Heavy Holiday Business.
One Store Reports 50 Per Cent
Increase Over Last Year.
' As the' result of the Santa Fe
bonuses and many others during the
Christmas holidays Topeka stores en
joyed the best Christmas shopping in
history, according to statements made
today.
A. P. McKown of Pelletier'a, stated
this mdrning that the Christmas
trade exceeded their expectations.
Also that the class of goods pur
chased was better and that practical
gifts were those most in demand.
"It struck me that I ha'd- never
seen people imbued with so,?- much
Christmas spirit," said Mr. MCKown.
W. W. Whit ney o f Warren M.
Crosby also reported the best Christ
mas trade in years. The Santa F
bonus was given by him as the cause
of the big trade.
"We've had the biggest trade by 50
per cent that , we ever enjoyed at
Christmas time in Topeka," saif! -H.
A. Auerbach of the Palace Clothing
company. "Every one seemed to de
mand practical Christmas gifts."
C A. Karl an of the Karlan Furni
ture company stated that the trade
was- better than in former years and
that the quality of furniture pur
chased was much better than usual.
FIND MEANEST MAN
The Rock Island Officials Have Lo
cated Him in Topeka.
C. E. Bascom, city passenger agent
for the Hock Island, thinks that he
has at last discovered the meanest
man. The man in question recently
swapped grips with the Pullman con
ductor on a Frisco train into Kansas
City, and brought the trainman's grip
home to Topeka with him before he
noticed the exchange. Then he started
on a still hunt for his own grip. He
thought at first that he had swapped
with a Rock Island conductor, then
that he had been given the wrong
-baggage at the checkstand in Kansas
City. The Rock Island men here spent
76 cents" telephoning to Kansas City
before they finally located the real
owner of the grip.
Then the erstwhile passenger assert
ed that the Rock Island was to blame
for the whole trouble, and when his
property was finally located, refused
to pay the telephone charges for find
ing it. And the Rock Island, rather
than fuss with him about it, paid the
charges, but still insists that as the
exchange was made- before the pass
enger even got onto & Rock Island
train, the latter road has been made
the goat.
BATTERY A'S ZOO
A Bear and a Borro Are Brought
Back From the Border.
Probably the most interesting mem
ber of Battery A's numerous collec
tion of mascots to return with the or
ganization from the border, was Cor
poral McLean's bear, which was pur
chased from a Mexican. The bear is
only a cub, and was a very badly
frightened cub when he arrived in To
peka Friday. Other mascots with the
battery included several dogs, and ev
ery dog wore a red blanket. The bear
disdained a blanker, however.
Lieutenant "Jimmy" Hughes was
the owner of a burro some seven
hands high, which rode bravely with
a mortified expression into Topeka,
standing in one of the transport
wagons loaded on one of the flat cars.
The canvas wagon cover had been
drawn around the neck of the unfor
tunate animal and tied, so that only
the lugubrious countenance of the
lieutenant's pet protruded.
The owner of the burro asserts that
he is going to institute a course in
equitation (which is army highbrow
for riding) for the benefit of his young
sters, and that the burro was pur
chased as an accessory before the fact.

BETTER U. P. SERVICE
A New Schedule in Erfect Thru To
peka After January 1.
Beginning January 1, 1917, new
train service thru Topeka to Kansas
City will be installed by the Union Pa
cific. Trains 169 and 170, which now
operate only between Oakley and Sa
lina, will thereafter run thru from
Oakley to Kansas City and return. No.
170, Oakley to Kansas City will leave
Salina each morning at 3:30 in the
afternoon, pass thru Topeka at about
8:30 in the evening and reach Kansas
City at 10:30 in the evening.
Returning, train No. 169 will leave
Kansas City at 12:15 o'clock in the
morning, and will arrive at Salina at
7 o'clock in the morning, passing thru
Topeka at about 2:15 o'clock in the
morning.
The change will make thru trains of
169 and 170, which were formerly
classified as locals. The time of the
Salina-Hill City motor car service will
also be changed, in order to accom
modate the new schedule of 169 and
170.
In addition to the change of sched
ule, thru sleeping car service will be
added to the new trains. The sleeper
will operate between Salina and Kan
sas City.
A slight change is announced in the
schedule of train No. 104, a thru train
from Denver, which will hereafter
leave Denver at 8:30 o'clock in the
evening instead of at 9 o'clock, and
will arrive at Kansas City at 5 o'clock
in the evening instead of at 4:50,
thus lengthening the running time -of
the train 35 minutes. The change will
not affect the arrival of the train at
Topeka more than three or four min
utes, it is believed.

SPENDS CHRISTMAS IN BED
Entrance to County Hospital Christ
mas Present to Veteran, 98.
Denver, Colo., Dec 25. Charles
Thompson, 96, veteran of the Mexican
and Civil wars, today is spending his
first Christmas in bed with the county
hospital here. His friends believed it
would be better for him to rest this
winter, so they obtained his admission
into the hospital.
Thompson was born in Madison
county. New York, in 1820. He is the
grandson of Nehemiah Thompson, one
of the first men to ring the Liberty
bell.
CANADIAN CORPS
Spectacular Victory Scored
Daring Surprise Attack.
Into Enemy Trenches Two Min
utes After Charge,
With the British Armies in France,
Dec. 25. North of Arras certain Ca
nadian troops have just accomplished
what the British officers declare
marks a new phase in modern trench
warfare. In a raid, which, however,
was much more than a raid, they suc
ceeded in putting out of action, tem
porarily, at least, an entire battalion
of German infantry. They took fifty
nine prisoners, including one commis
sioned officer and estimated that they
killed 150 Germans in dugouts which
were blown to atoms after their oc
cupants refused to surrender. The
Canadian losses were extremely light.
The Mraid" took place at 3 o'clock in
the afternoon on'a front of 400 yards.
The German prisoners admit they
were taken completely by surprise.
The officer captured said he was con
vinced that something was about to
happen but believed the attack was
comings on Christmas eve.
The Canadians, mostly stalwart
men from the plains of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan, Alberta, had skillfully
established themselves well forward
so that when the artillery had ceased
the preparatory fire they we're in the
German front line trenches in less
than two minutes.
Pelt Knemy With Grenades,
The officer in command, who was
reporting the raid to brigade head
quarters by telephone said that he had
hardly uttered the words, "They're
off," before he had to say, "They're
in." Consternation reigned among the
Germans who scrambled for the saps
and dugouts leading to the rear
trenches while the Canadians pelted
them with hand grenades. Caught
unprepared, . many - Germans in th
front line offered no resistance but
threw up their hands with cries of
"Kamerad." Others were taken as
they fled for the second and third
lines for the Canadians pushed on
quickly on the second trenches.
About twenty dugouts were destroy
ed by Canadians, several with bombs
captured from the Germans. No at
tempt was made at a counter attack
until the following night when the
Germans bombarded and raided their
own first line or what was left of it
thinking the raiders were still there.
As a matter of fact the Canadians
who carried out the operation were
miles away. They were not part of
the fighting line but on rest and had
gone forward for this particular piece
of work which was planned weeks ago.

NEED BRAND NEW
CONSTITUTION IN
KANSAS-WHITE
Urges Call for Constitutional
Convention by Legislature.
State's Powers Atrophying; Of
ficials' Hands Are Tied.
GOVERNOR ONLY FIGUREHEAD
Power of Legislature So
Cramped It's Useless.
Xew Aersion of "What's the
Matter With Kansas.
Emporia, Kan., Dec. 25. William
Allen White, chief oracle and head
trainer of the Bull Moose in Kansas
thrusts a brand new splinter into the .
Progressives platform with an urgent
appeal for a new Kansas state con--stitution.
Not a mere remodeling is
called for. He urges a constitutional
convention capable of doing the Job
all over and turning out an up-to-date-model;
junking the old vehicle and
replacing it with one of the "eight
cylinder, storage battery ignition, va
cuum feeder, self-starter" kind that
will place state rights back in the
running again.
The Gazette editor cites the gradual
usurpation of state powers by the fed
eral government, and views with
alarm. Political powers of the state,
he declares are atrophying; state gov
ernments are tremendously ineffi
cient; governors are mere figureheads
and legislatures are cramped in their
powers and clumsy. Why? Because,
the FJmporia sage essays, the state
constitutions are obsolete or worse.
No More Now laws.
Incidentally, the Kmporia editor
frames a program for the coming ses
sion of the legislature that would
make the average Kansas statesman;
dizzy. Not due to its elaborateness,
but to its brevity. It stands:
"Pass a good roads resolution.
"Call a constitutional convention.
"Pass the appropriation bills.
"Then go home."
In an editorial urging this line of
state reform, Mr. White says:
Period of lleeonst ruction.
"We are going thru a period of po
litical reconstruction in America, the
most drastic in a century. We have
strongly democratized "our politics."
electing senators directly by the peo
ple, and by states enfranchising mil
lions of our women. The primary is
democratizing the party, and we have
all but nationalized the democratic
nomination of our presidents, and
seem near to the popular election of
presidents. All this is breaking down
state lines. We are about to give in to
national control of our child labor,
our banking, our railroads, our post
roads, and even our schools are show
ing a tendency to become federalized
thru the acceptance of federal aid for
military training.
"Scores of political functions that
ten years ago pertained almost entire
ly to the state are atrophying. The
state in our American government is
becoming, for the time at least, more
or less useless. And this is largely
due to the fact that our state govern
n.nts are tremendously Inefficient.
"They are inefficient because state
governments are obsolete. They bind
the hands of state officers every time
state officers would do any real vital
thing in modern life, and our govern
ors have become mere figureheads
plug-hatted nothings who attend cere
monies and wish they were of some
real consequence.
"Our state constitutions are largely
to blame. They should be revised.
The state has a real place in our
scheme of things. But the state can
not function as matters stand. The
governor has no power. The legisla
ture is cramped in its powers and
where it has power, the legislature is
so clumsy that it acts slowly. The
state officers are clerks, but they are
elected as tho they were statesmen.
"We need a thoro-going revision of
our state constitutions. Kansas above
other states, must have a new consti
tution if it keeps up with the proces
sion of modern thought.
Time Is Ripe Now.
"The time is ripe for a rewriting of
the Kansas constitution. We are in
a time of political calm. We have no
serious agitation before the people.
Party lines and factional lines are
loosely drawn. We can approach &
j new constitution with open minds and
no serious prejuagmenis. i ne Kansas
legislature can do no better, than m
pass a good roads resolution, enable
Kansas to join the federal good roads
movement, then pass a resolution call
ing for a constitutional convention;
then pass the appropriations bills;
and
"Then adjourn."
HOMES DESERTED
BY XMAS JOY IN
HUNT FOR MISSING
Chicago, Dec. 25. There will be
more than 200 Chicago homes in
which Christmas joy will be darkened
by the unexplained absence of mem
bers of the family. The record of
missing persons in the police depart
ment shows that 236 men, women and
children have been reported as miss
ing in the last two weeks and only sv
few of these have returned.
The average number of persons dis
appearing is about 300 each year ac
cording to police officials. Of these
the majority are men. The number
about equals the number of unidenti
fied ov'! bodies picked up from the
lake or nvr-r or in out of the way
places.
The youngest missing pprnon on th
records is 10-year-old Bernard Me
Nulty. who disappeared from his par
ents home December 11.
