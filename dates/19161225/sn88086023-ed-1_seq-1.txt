The birds that sing and the flowers that shine

May some friends hang their hearts for me.

BARON IS ORDERED
TO ELLIS ISLAND
NEW YORK. Dec. 25. Baron Rob
ert Oppenheim of London and Paris
was not permitted to land upon his
arrival here in an expensive first ca
bin of he Holland-American liner
Noordam.
Immigration inspectors boarded the
steamer yesterday morning and, after
questioning the Baron, ordered him
to be taken to Ellis Island this mor
ning. Two of the Noordam-! crew were
stationed in front of the Baron's ca
bin while he remained inside.
Considerable mystery surrounded
the detention. Immigration Commis
sioner Howe said that he knew noth
ing about it. Immigration Inspectors
declined to say anything except that
they were "acting under orders."
These, it is understood, came from
Washington.
"It must be a case of mistaken
identity," suggested the Baron to a
reporter; "anyhow Irs only a trifle. It
will be quickly adjusted. I came over
to travel in your country for two
months and I expect to carry out my
plans."
Baron Eugene Oppenheim of Syra
cuse, a brother, was on the pier to
meet Baron Robert. He refused to
be interviewed. Baron Robert Is
known here as a financier, one of tha
organizers of a brimstone corner and
as a French banker.

py-faced children, and her second an'
nual municipal Christmas celebration
goes down In the calendar of the year's
events as a huge success.
Not only were the children of the
c!tv out In swarms to greet the arri
val of merry Saint Nick but hundreds
of grown-ups as well braved the
kwering December temperatures to
participate In the wholesome revelry
01 Yuletide.
The festivities began at 6:30 when
a snowy float began to wend its way
through the street! of the city bear
ing a bevy of caroling youngsters and
continued until past 8:30 when the last
of the eager children had received
from the bushy-whiskered old visitor
candy, nuts and popcorn.
I'ntll a quarter past the seven
o'clock hour, the electrically illumi
nated float occupied by the chorus of
children traversed the principal bus
iness and residence streets of the city,
and their fresh young voices lifted In
happy song gave the Christmas cele
bration the flavor of a Dickens story.
While yet these youthful songsters
were caroling their way about the
town, the high school cadet corps, un
der the diretloet Sergeant Tonne
came marching; down Main street and
maneuvered In the roped-off block
between Alta and Court. Meanwhile
a dense pack had gathered around tha
tall evergreen tree at the Intersection
of Main and Alta which shone brilli
antly with the myriad of varicolored
lights scattered among its branches.
The arrival of the children's float
at the tree was the signal for a troop
of school girls, airly clad, to appear
in the street. Gracefully they danced
the folk dances emblematic of the
Yuletide.
On an elevated platform built be
neath the branches of the Christmas
tree, a chorus of forty well trained
choristers took their place and filled In
the program with anthems. A very
pleasing feature of the program was
p. reading, reflecting the spirit of the
occasion, by Miss Olive Gwlnn. Pen
dleton's gifted young dramatic reader.
And last and best of all to thT ex-I-ectant
children cam" Santa Claus,
His approach from the north where
is his home was heralded by the blast
of trumpets blown by six red-coated
ttumpeteers who strode in advance of
the old toy-maker's float. Unfortu
nately the snowstorm which Santa
Claus had directed to precede his com
ing was a day late In reaching Pen
dleton, and his reindeer found It hard
work to drag his heavilv-laden sleigh.
To make It easier for them, the com
mittee had provided a most appropri
