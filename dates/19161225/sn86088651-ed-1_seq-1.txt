day and Christmas day at the home
of Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Lane waa held
a reunion of the family of Mr. and Mrs
P. P. Smith, of Waxahachle, Mrs.
I,ane being their dauchter. Among
tho mnny enjoyable affairs that are
being held during the holidays there
will be none that will surpass this
because of the fact this was the first
time smh an affair has ever been
held by tho family since Mr. and Mrs.
Smith's first child was married, ten
years ago.
A big feature of the entertainment
was a I nrtstmaa ireo . iirisuim

Walton of the beautiful homo of
Mr. and Mrs. Lane, whhh la situated
not far from the bank of the Braios
river entangled In beautiful trees
and fertllo soils, afforded a picture
esuue scene for the reunion.
Those present, which Included the

II. C. Smith and four children of Ma

Bryan has had Its first municipal
Christmas tree and the Idea was so
unique, the spirit so lofty and the
service so beautiful It will no doubt
be continued from year to year as
one of the city's most cherished In
stltutions.
The initial tree and service were
held last night, as previously an
nounced through the columns of the
Eagle, In the center ot the Civic
League park, a very large crowd was
oresent and all were charmed with
the beautiful Innovation.
The tree waa a stately cedar and
had been beautifullf decorated by the
young ladles of the Reading Club who
were the Inaugurators of the more
ment. and with Ita many bued lights
flashing from Its branches, Its lo-u
stresmers of tinsel reflecting the glo
of the electric bulbs like sblmering
streams of light, and the clever rep
resentation ot snow at Its base, It was
Indeed a sight beautiful to behold and
an Inspiration for the awakening of
the true Christmas spirit. The youn
ladles who planed the affair and fol
lowed It to a successful consummation
are entitled to the warmeat praise
from the entire cltlxenshlp, and the
succes of this first tree will no doubt
draw to them a far greater coopcra
tlon on the part ot the general public
when the time comes for the next
The selection ot the Civic League
park for the service was a most hap
py coincidence, as It Is the work of
woman'a hands and the two togethe
furnished a forcible reminder that the
women of Bryan are doing the things
that really count.
After the crowd had assembled,
Judge V. 11. Hudson called the assent

poses for which we had come tngeth.-i

Rev. Ray was a resident of New York
City when Its first municipal Christ
