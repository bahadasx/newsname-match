PRES1E1MT WILSON'S NOTE
TOPIC IN PARIS PAPERS
Stress Laid on Its Appearance Coin
cident With Germany's Offer.
Paris, Saturday. Dec 23, 3.95 p. m.
President Wilson's note is still the
principal topic in the .press, stress be
ing laid in the comment on its coin
cidence with the period of deliberation
by- the allies on Germany's offer to
negotiate. Most of the editorial writ
ers insist also upon the precedent es
tablished by Secretary of State Seward
of President Lincoln's cablnat, in re
jecting the intervention of Napoleon
III. during the American Civil war.
The Journal Des Debats publishes in
its' entirety Secretary . Seward's .despatch-to
th,iCrBch foreign minister
on February 6, 1863, in reffiection of
the French proffer of mediation be
tween the north and the south.
"The eminent Jurist," says La Li
berte, "is ignorant of nothing in pre
cedents. President Wilson certainly
has not forgotten President Lincoln's
reply to the overtures by France to
terminate the war of secession. Pres
ident Wilson cannot expect any other
reply from France." Referring to the
ambiguity of the note, the newspaper
says:
"But Mr. Wilson probably did not

cathedrals, while at the same time
despatches informed us that the de
portations and shootings of Belgians
continue in spite of the protestations
of Cardinal Mercier, a great prelate,
who might well find an echo among
great humanitarians such as Presi
dent Wilson.
"What is most striking in the note,"
adds La LtsKjrte, "is the coincidence
of its publication with the delivery of
the German note. We have no inten
tion to suspect his word when he de
clares he did not in any way seek
to support the German offer, but it
Is so necessary to put them into close
comparison that it will be difficult to

SINGERS TROOPED THROUGH
THE STREETS OF BOSTON

Tree Was Brilliantly Lighted.
Boston, Dec. 24. Bands of singers
trooped through the streets tonight
singing "Peace on earth, good will to

miliar hymns. . , . .
. Oh the Common, a. great Christmas
tree -was brilliantly lighted, while in
the Parkman Memorial band stand

concert. Mayor Curley in a brief ad
dress to . the throng about the tree
urged them to remember in the midst
of their own gladness and plenty the
sufferings of war-torn Jbiurope and to
pray that another Christmas might not
come without peace.
Rarely before at the Christmas sea
son have the city's poor been provided
for so abundantly through the medium
not only of the usual charitable or
ganizations, but through scores of in
dividuals and community committees.
In some districts patrolmen took the
names of the neediest families and at
each of these houses a bagful of pro
visions was left through the generos
ity of a. citizen whose identity is known
only to high officials of the police de-
parement. For some of the neediest
cases coal in half ton lots was left yes
terday by order of the same unnamed
benefactor.
The idea of the community Christ

than ever before in suburbin towns

Paris, Ded 24. 5.50 p. m.--The unani
mous vote o fthe senate aftirminer that
France cannat conclude peace with an.
enemy who occupies French territory,
coming at the same time as the peace
of the Swiss government, has stirred
anew the French press and public. The
action of the senate gave further in
dication of the attitude of the allies
toward President Wilson's proposal,
while confidence votes in the Briand
ministry was regarded most favorably.
ine roreign aftairs committee of the
Chamber devoted a large part of the
session yesterday to an examination
of President Wilson's note.
The Pitit Journal suggests that
President Wilson, in sending the note
knew he would have the support of
Switzerland and says: v
France honors its neighbor, menaced
like Belgium perhaps, but France,
which did not want war, knows that
there are suggestions that honor and
interest prevent it from hearing."
The Petit Parisien says that . the
Swiss note confirms one of the declar
ations of President Wilson, referring
to discussions engaged in five weeks
ago between Berne and. Washington.
It adds "the note deserves the -same
courteous examination and reserve.
France will not forget the treatment
by the Swiss of the interned and ex
patriated people but has a right to re
call that as to the war the, entente al
lies cannot be placed on the same
footing as the central powers."
