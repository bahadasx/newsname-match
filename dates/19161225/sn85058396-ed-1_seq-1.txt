HOLDUPS FAST
ANDJRIOUS
.Chicago, Dec. 25. Christmas Eve
holdups spent a fast and furious 4S
hours previous to the dawning of
Christmas day. Four boys well dress
ed and apparently not over 17 years
old executed nearly twenty robberies
and obtained more than ?1000 besides
watches, rings, sticliplna and oyor-
coats. They used a small car and
covered a wide range of territory.
Three armed robbers held up Wil
liam Rucker and searched him with
out finding any money. Then they
took away the Christmas turkey he
was carrying home and sold it to a
pedestrian for three dollars. Then
they took tho turkey away from the
pedestrian again.
Three otjier armed men showed a
flash of Christmas spirit after they
held up Dr. Benjamin Augustus.
"Leave me something for car fare,"
I he said. "I'm on a sick call."
"Sure," one of tho robbers said,
"here's half a dollar, Merry Christ
mas." The same band held up Harry
Lynch, getting $33 and later Robert
McCoustln reported being robbed of
$8 by men who were apparently the
same trio.

PEACE SESSIONS I
HELD IN BERLIN I
Continuous Meetings Held I
Since Receipt, of President'
Woodrow Wilson's Note. I
MAY MAKE STATEMENT I
American Recommendation H
Meeting With Sympathetic I
Reception in Official IS
Circles. w kg
Berlin, Saturday, Dec. 23, 6 p. m.
Via London, Dec. 25, 12:25 p. m. H
President Wilson's note with its rec
ommendations to the belligerents that
they enter in some way into an inter ;
change of views looking to peace
terms, has been the discussion at con
tinuous peace sessions and meetings
by German diplomats since its deliv
ery. Foreign Secretary Zimmerman
last night dined with Emperor Wll
liam at Potsdam and had an oppor
tunity to learn the emperor's opinion
on the suggestions. In addition a
lively interchange of views is pro
ceedlng between the capitals of the
Central Powers.
The note will be answered only in
agreement by the Teuton allies but H
it is already evident that the reconi
mendation is meeting with a sympa- "
thetic reception in official circles and
that there is a good possibility that
unless the proposal is blocked from
the other side it may lead to the
bringing out of a statement in some
form of the Central Powers' ideas on
future peace.
Note Opens Way to Peace Talk.
It has been realized from the be
ginning that a demand from the en
tente for the publication of the cen
tral powers' terms as a reply to tho
German overtures might lead to the
placing of Germany and her allies in
the unfavorable tactical position of
showing their cards to an opponent
whose hand was still concealed and
a disposition is manifesting itself H
here to regard President Wilson's IH
proposals as offering a chance, other
wise presented only by a conference,
of bringing out a simultaneous state
ment of conditions from both sides IH
without placing either at the dlsad- IH
vantage of making the first move. IH
A decision, apparently has not been H
reached and the opinion that Ger
many may be willing to place a state- H
ment of 'her terms in the hands of a
third party if her opponents are will
ing to do tho same, can only be giv
' en as that of individuals, although of H
fairly influential individuals. It can jH
be stated with all positiveness, how- mM
ever, that the view taken by certain
newspapers organs usually enrolled
among Pan-American-German advo- mM
cates of "ruthless sweeping annexa- WM
tions and war to the knife," that Pres
ident Wilson's note is a measure in- 11
spired by the entente and in its in
terests, is no't held in official cir- wM
On the contrary it is felt that Pres- ' j
ident Wilson's move was marked by
real neutrality and inspired solely by 11
a consideration of the interests of the 11
United States, of neutrals in general 11
and the peace of tho world and will -j
be answered in that spirit j
