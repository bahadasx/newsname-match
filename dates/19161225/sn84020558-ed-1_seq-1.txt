Christmas, the celebartion of the
birth of the Christ Child, wan for
mally ushered in in Phoenix at a few
minutes after twelve this morning,
when a large congregation gathered
at St. Mary's Catholic church to lis
ten tl solemn high mass. Three
Spanish priests of the Franciscan
order sun? the service.
The services were impressive in the
extreme, the beautilul altar lit up
with candles, the face of the con
gregation lit up with the failh that
has carried the world for ages, mixed
wi'li the sonorous oices of the
priests, made a. fitting setting for
the first formal Christmas service.
That Christmas has some other
inightiur
meaning than that of gift giving, that I memory of the poor,
the birth of the Redeemer of tht j Christmas presents wil be more nu
werld is the chief motive behind the ! merous and more expensive this, year

lesson from that ecnt, and grieved
ovr tiv present situation in Mexico,
the fatherland of the major portion
of the audience.
The altar was beautifully decorated
in honor of the occasion, a large star
lighted with electricity shining forth
from a bower of green.
The music of the service, as sung
bv a well trained choir, was one of
the most pleasing features of the
mass.
The mass drew one of the largest
congregation ever attending a like
service in Phoenix. Not only those
of Catholic belief were present, but
many prntestants bowed to the spirit
of the dav, and joined with their
brethren in celebrating the birth of
Him who gave His life that the
world might be saved.

The formal lighting of the tree was

mumty Christmas eve celebration here

and Secretary and Mrs. McAdoo stood
with her.
The celebration was participated in
by boy and girl scouts. Afterward
groups of the boys and girls went to
their own neighborhoods and sang
nnsimas carois,
The Christ lore in song and story
was the theme that bound every church
and every worshipper together yester
day. Services in all Phoenix churches,
were built around the theme of Christ
mas, and practically every congrega
tion listened to special musical pro
grams that were also in harmony with
the subject.
With such splendid programs, it was
not surprising that attendance in all
places of worship yesterday was heavy.
A gray day outside did not mean that
there was any gloom in the heart. Li
beral contributions were taken up for
the poor, one church collecting about
a hundred and twenty-five dollars at
its evening service, alone, for the spe
cial benefit fund for the needy.
Of special interest were the musical
programs, arranged particularly for
Christmas at the following churches:
First Methodist, Christian, Grace
1 Lutheran. Zion Lutheran, Central
j Methodist. Bethel Methodist, Trinity
I Pro-cathedral. First Presbyterian and
St. Mary's where services were held
morning, evening and at midnight.
Children took a prominent part in
cantatas and in programs of Christmas
recitations at a number of the
churches.
The day before Christmas was ob
served splendidly in the congregations
ami as splendidly in the homes. A large
number of Christmas Eve parties were
held, and of course, Santa Claus was
abroad, although the weather man said
the snow wouldn't come until today,
and then not in this part of Arizona.
A numbor of the churches will be
giving special programs today. Promi
nent among these are the Presbyterian,
which will hold an extremely interest
ing praise service by the Chorus Choir
at 7:80 this evening, and the 5r.tce
Evangelical Lutheran church, which
has a considerable program to put on.
A feature of the Presbyterian service
tonight will he the cantata, in which
some of the most notable players and
singers in the city will take part.
Peside the church rites today will be
the charitable work of the Salvation
Army, the goodfellows club, the Asso

INT P T T IF WILSON
NOTE IS SOMEWHAT CONFUSED
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
BERLIN, Dec. 24. (By wireless to
Tuckerton, N. J.) The interpretation
of President Wilson's suggestions con
cerning peace are somewhat confused
by the fact that yesterday's comment
was based on the short extracts from
his note received here and the1 fact
that Secretary of State lousing also
made a statement concerning the situa
tion which the German people are ut
sure has not been distorted, says the
Overseas News agency.
"This confusion." the news ugency
adds, "is illustrated by the fact that the
communication published by the Voss
iche Zeitung and today differs in im
portant points. Yesterday the-Vossiche
Zeitung considered the president's note
as "diplomatic intrigue," which ban
been prompted by an effort to shield
England and declared that the note
ought to be received by Germany with
the greatest distrust. Today's com
ment by the Vossiche Zeitung remarks
that the president's suggestions in their
main points, are reeonciliable with Ger
many's attitude. It says the note is a
complicated document, which is open
to various interpretations, and adds:
"There is no reason for Germany to
harbor distrust against President Wil
son and believe he was sincere when he

make known their peace conditions."

Three bagi were first supposed to

admitted that the latter might have
been the case, although the watchers
declared hist night that the bags in
question had not been in the hands
of the official inspectors.

anew to the bags containing the
ballots of the following precincts:
