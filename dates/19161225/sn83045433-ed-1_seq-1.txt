of that number. 50 are in the W0 class.
03 in the 110 elans. 4 in the 050 ClamS
434 in the S0 class and 119 In the W0O
class.
Of the high school teachers, more than
300 are in the group paid between LC,0
and $1.0. There are 14 teachers getting
from 1,900 to 00,200, but that is practicLIly
a closed grade.
The janitors work on an average of
twelve hours a de y. They have no sick
leave and are responsible for the safety
of thousands of dollars worth of prop
erty, as well as for the safety of the
school children. Seventy-three of these
men work for $60 a month and 19 are paid
less than W60.
The schol laborer. are even more
poorly paid. There are 90 getting fromi

Under these circumstances the school
employes 9f the District feel that it is
an unfair discrimination to dgny them
the benefit of the 6 and 10 per ceht graded
increases which other employes are about
to receive.
The high school teachers have prepared
an argument to accompany their ached
Ile of increases to be sought from Con
cress. It says in part:
"The tendency has been more and more
during the last few years to throw upon
the teacher and especially the high school
teacher very many of those functions
once exercised almost exclusively by the
parents at home. The mere teaching so
oalled. is stressed just as sharply and in
sistently, but to it has been added all
those interlocking student activities which
now form such an important part of high
school work and which are so intimately
associated with preparation for efficient
ctizenship and proper individual develop
ment a~ong al lines. This has been made
possible because of the absolute freedom
of the teacher from financial worries due
to insufficient salary. The demands upon
the teacher are more than double what
they were eight years ago, and when
they require a much higher standard of
ll-around efficiency, would deal a stag
gering blow to the morale of the high
school teachers of the Capital of the
United States as indicative of a low esti

Attack Answered Overtures of German
Chancellor, Says Teuton Critic.
(By the Iateruatiesal News iterviev.)
Berlin (via Sayville wireless). Dec. 24
The military critic of the Overseas News
Agency writes:
"In spite of the continued Russo-Ru
manian attacks on a 30-kilometer front
in the wooded Carpathians and in e rn
Transylvania, the German fighting ine
.t has remained unchanged during
is charging offensive, which has now
been going on for four weeks.
"On the west front the fighting activity
of the last few days did not pass the usual
pressure of trench warfare. The French
advance northeast of Verdun, planned
on a great style and carried out tennel
ously, brought them a local success, but
it did not change the situation on the
rest of the front.
"Already on December 16 the French
attack came to a standstill north of
Besonvaux village. On December 1t and
19 there was only fighting about Cham
brette's farm and since then thd situa
tion has been calm.
"This great attack, which had been
planned as France's answer to the Ger
man peace proposals-expressly designed
as such by the French commander-came
to a standstill, as did the previous ones.
"On the Somme front there was calm
interrupted only by a temporary increase
in the artillery fire when the 'weather
was favorable. On the rest of the front
there were only patrol actions and artil
lery fire,
"The situation of our adversaries on the
third war Christmas is not different from
that of one gpd two years ago. To be
sure, the mens of fighting has been In
creased in a 'gigantic fashIon, but the
relation of the forces has remained identi
cally -the same.'

The overseas News Agency today quoted
from a Jasq newspaper to iustrate "the
feelings of the Rumana toward the
Russians." The paper Is quoted as may
Ing:
"There Is not a Rumanian who did not
do everything in his power, but this strug
gle is too hard. As far as the Rumanians
are concerned, they do ne6 die without
honor. But without honor are those who
dragged Rumania into misfortune.
The news agency adds:
"This feeling is also confirmed by Ru
manian prisoners. The suffering of the
Rumanian population as a consequence
of the devastation of their country by the
Russians is shown by an appeal Issued

"'After the failures of owr wassa

the miserable position of thes people.
Many of them frose to death on their

with innumerable corpses which remain

"The Russians in Moldavia ruthlessly
