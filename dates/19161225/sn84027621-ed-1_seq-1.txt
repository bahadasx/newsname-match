Field Headquarters v American Ex

ordinary improvement in marksman
ship is being noted in reports receiv
ed at field headquarters. The regu
lar life of the soldiers has steadied
their nerves, and the clear air of the
Mexican plateau region makes sight
ing easy. Another factor in the good
showing is the steady drill the men
have received in fire control, , new
methods of which are being tried by
the cavalry with remarkable success.
Machine gun troops also are being
drilled to use their arms to the best
advantage. Recently several com
panies of the 16th Infantry were
brought north from EI Valle and
demonstrations of fire control were
given for the benefit of the officers
stationed there. . ., The machine gun
work was under the direction of Cap
tain F. S. Bowen,) assisted by Capt.
W. C. Short. 4
Among the most interesting experi
ments1 now being conducted is that in
pistol firing by a detachment of cav
airy, chosen at random. A pistol
board, which is conducting the work,
has evolved a unique line of targets
worked by ropes and pulleys, which
fall flat when the cavalry charge
over them. The attempt is being
made to evolve a system of pistol
firing while charging. At present the
men are firing directly ahead while
leaning forward in their saddles and
holding their arms just ahead to the
right of their mounts' ears. Excel
lent results, it is said, have already
been obtained.
When ammunition arrives, another
interesting test will be made, that of
determining how effectually the pres
ent three-inch field gun will demolish
barbed wire entanglements, trenches
and bomb proofs. A line of fortifica
tions has been constructed as nearly
like those in Europe as possible. The

31isery of the Afflicted People Set
Forth in the Letter of Cardinal
Mercier
(Associated Press)
New York, Dec. 25. Cardinal Mer
cier's protest against the deportation
of Belgians to Germany, only brief
excerpts of wtach came in the cable
dispatches, has been received here by
the Associated Press in its full text,
as follows: ,
"Malines, November 7th, 1916.
"Every day the military authori
ties deport from Belgium into Ger
many thousands of inoffensive citizens
to oblige them there to perform forc
ed labor.
"As early as October 19th we sent
to the governor general a protest, a
copy of which was handed to the
representatives of the Holy See, of '
Spam, the United States and Holland,
in Brussels, but the governor general
replied to it that nothing could be
done.
"At the time of our protestation,
the orders of the occupying power
threatened only the unemployed; to
day every able-bodied man is carried
off, pell-mell, assembled in freight
cars, and carried off to unknown
parts, like a herd of slaves. The en
emy proceeds by regions. Vague
rumors had come to our ears that ar
rests had ben made in Tournau, Ghent
and Alost, but we were not aware of
the conditions under which they had
been made. Between October 24th
and November 2nd, it occurred in the
region of Mons, Quievrain, Saint
Guislain and Jemappes, in bunches of
800 to 1200 men a day. The next,
and the following days, it occurred in
the Arrondissement of Nivelles. Here
Is a speciment of the announcement
concerning the proceedings:
" 'By order of the Kreischef every
male person over 17 years old, shall
present himself, Place Saint Paul, in
Nivelles, on November 8th, 1916, at 8
o'clock (Belgian time) 9 o'clock (cen
tral time) bringing with him his iden
tification card and eventually his card
from the meldeamt. '
Only small handbaggage is per
mitted, .-i.;,
" 'Those not presenting themselves
will be forcibly deported into Ger
many and will besides be liable to a
heavy fine and to long imprisonment.
'"Ecclesiastics, physicians, lawyers
and teachers are exempt from this
order.
" 'The mayors will be held responsi
ble for the proper execution of this
order which must be brought immed
iately to the knowledge of the inhab
itants.' "Between the announcement and the
deportation there is an interval of
only 24 hours.
"Under pretext of public works to
be performed on Belgian soil, the oc
cupying power had attempted to ob
tain from the communities the lists
cf working men out of work. Most of
the communities proudly refused.
"Three decrees from the general
government prepared the way for the
execution which is in force today.
"Under date of August 15th, 1915,
a first decree imposes, under penalty
of imprisonment and fine, forced work
on the idle,- but adds that the work is
to be executed in Belgium, and that
non-compliance will be adjudged by
Belgian tribunals.
"A second decree, dated May 2nd,
1916, reserves the right of the Ger
man authorities, to supply work to
the idle and threatens a fine of three
years' imprisonment and 20,000 marks
imposable on anybody executing or
ordering to be executed work not ap
proved by the general government.
"Under the same decree, the right
to judge infractions which had re
mained with the Belgian tribunals,
passes from the Belgian to the Ger
man tribunals. '
"A third decree, dated May 18th,
artillery will be allowed to work on
these under conditions that would ob
tain in actual war and the results of
their fire will be noted.
Mlffl(Qia
Sets
1916, 'authorizes the governors, the
military commanders and the chiefs
of arrondissements to order that the
unemployed be conducted by force to
the places where they must work.'
This was aireaay lorcible working,
although in Belgium.
"Now it is no longer a question of
forcible working in Belgium, but in
Germany, and for the benefit of the
Germans.
, "To give an appearance of plausi
bility to these violent measures, the
occupying power insisted in the Ger
man press, both in Germany and Bel
gium, on these two pretexts: the un
employed constitute a danger to pub
lic order, and a burden on official ben
evolence. "To this we replied in a letter ad
dressed to the governor general and
to the head of the political depart
ment, on October 16th, as follows:
" 'You are well aware that public
order is in no wise threatened and
that all influence, moral and civil,
would support you spontaneously
were it in danger.
'"The unemployed are not a bur
den on official benevolence, it is not
from your funds that they receive as
sistance.' ' ,
"In his reply the governor general
no longer urges these two first con
siderations, but he alleges that 'doles
to the unemployed from whatever
source they may come at present,
must finally be a charge upon our fi
nances, and that, it is the duty of a
good administrator to lighten such
charges;' he adds that 'prolonged un
employment would cause our work
men to lose their technical proficiency,
and that in the time of peace to come
they would be useless to industry.'
"True, there were other ways in
which our finances might have been
protected. We might have been spar
ed those war levies which have now
reached the sum of one billion francs,
and are still mounting up at the rate
cf 40 millions a month! we might have
been spared those requisitions in kind,
which amount to several thousands of
millions, and are exhausting us.
"There are other ways of provid
ing for the maintenance of profes
sional skill among our work people,
such as leaving to Belgian industry
its machinery and accessories, its raw
materials and its manufactured goods,
which have passed from Belgium into
Germany. And it -is neither to the
quarries nor to the lime kilns to which
the Germans themselves declare they
will send our unemployed that our
specialists will go to complete their
professional education.
"The naked truth is that every de
ported workman is another soldier for
the German army. He will take the
place of a German workman, who will
bo made into a soldier. Thus the sit
uation which we denounce to the civ
ilized world may be reduced to these
terms: Fourihundred thousand work
men have been thrown out of work by
no fault of their own, and largely on
account of the regime of the occupa
tion. ' Sons, husbands and fathers of
families, they bear their unhappy lot
without murmuring, respectful of
public order; national solidarity pro
vides their most pressing wants; by
dint of unselfish thrift and self-denial
they escape extreme destitution, and
they await with dignity and in a mu
tual affection which our national sor
rows have intensified, the end of our
common ordeal.
"Groups of soldiers introduced
themselves forcibly in the home of
these people, tearing the young peo
ple out of the army of their parents,
the husband from his wife, the father
from his children, at the point of the
bayonet they block the entrances to
the homes preventing wives and
mothers from rushing out to say a
last farewell to them; they align the
captives in groups of forty osr fifty
and push thein forcibly into freight
cars; the locomotive is under pressure
and as soon as a train load is ready,
an officer gives the signal and they
depart. Thus another thousand Bel
gians reduced to slavery, without pre-
vious trial, condemned to the penalty
which comes next in cruelty to the
death penalty; . deportation. They
don't know how long their exile is go
ing to last, neither do they know
where they are going. All they know
is that their work will benefit the en
emy. Several of them have been
brought to sign by coercion or by

AMERICANS SAVER
illY ARMENIANS
An Englishman's Testimony as to the
Efficacy of Our People's
Aid
London, Dec. 10. (Correspondence
of the Associated Press) George F.
Gracey, a member of the American
Committee for Armenian and Syrian
Relief, who has helped to feed and
clothe about 5,000 Armenians in their
native land and again when they fled
to the Caucasus to escape the Turks,
has just returned to London. "Most
of this was possible only through the
generosity of the American people,"
declared Mr. Gracey, who is not an
American but an Englishman and has
been a member of the American com
mittee for the last twelve years. Since
the war broke out he has been direct
ing the relief work for the Armenians
from Tiflis.
"Armenian has replaced Belgium
and Serbia as the most distressful
country on the face of. the globe,"
said Mr. Gracey. "The Armenians
have twice been driven from their
native land. Those who were not
massacred when the Turks invaded
their country early in the war filed to
the Caucasus. They returned when
the Russians drove the Turks out of
Armenia. They v were forced to flee
to the Caucasus again a few months
ago when the Turks chased the Rus
sians out of Mush and Bitlis, and for
a time threatened the czar's army at
Van, on the east side of the lake of
that name.
"When the Armenians were able to
return to their country early this year
they were without food, clothing or
the means of making a living. The
American committee came to the res
cue by supplying some 30,000 with
2,700 head of cattle and a large quan
tity of agricultural implements. This
work of repatriating them ran along
from May to August of this year.
Just as they were getting on their
feet again and starting out to face
life anew along come the reinforced
Turks. . The Ottoman troops succeeded
in taking Mush and Bitlis in the very
heart of Armenia. They then moved
along" the northern and western
shores of Lake Van with the object
of encircling the town of Van, which
was the base of the Russian opera
tions in that district. They did not
get to Van but clung to the shores of
the lake. That is the present military
situation in that territory.
"The object of the Russian incur
sion into Armenia was not only to
rescue the Armenians but to establish
a line from Trebizond on the Black
Sea across the neck of Asia Minor to
Aleppo and thus deprive Turkey of
the resources of Mesopotamia. 'Those
who have followed the course of the
war know what happened. They know
that the Russians were only partially
successful, that they captured Tre
bizond, Mush and Bitlis but were un
able to extend their line farther south
and prevent the subsequent loss of
the two last named praces.
"Although the Turks did not re
take Van, rumors of their approach
struck terror to the hearts of the re
patriated Armenians who had "been
chased from their homes a year be
fore. As stated they fled to the Cau
casus once more, taking with them
about 25,000 of their countrymen
from 'Mush and Bitlis, so that we are
at present confronted with the prob
lem of caring for about 25,000.
Mr. Gracey said he wanted to pay
tribute to the work of the American
Red Cross in Persia. Its base is at
Khoi and a Dr. Hazlett an American,
is in charge.

SCARCITY OF LONG
STAPLE COTTON SEED
Washington, Dec 25. The bureau
of plant industry, U. S. department
of agriculture, has issued the follow
ing statement advising cotton grow
ers to make certain of their supply
of seed for planting:
All kinds of cotton seed are likely
to be scarce at planting time next
spring. The unprecedented prices
now being paid at the oil mills may
tempt many, farmers to cut down
their reserves of planting seed or to
sell all of it, perhaps with the idea of
being able to buy seed of -a better'
variety for only a little more than
the mills are now paying for ordinary
gin-run seed. While it is always de
sirable to replace an inferior stock
with a better one, it" would be well to
make sure of the good planting seed
as soon as possible.
Special Demand for Long Staple Seed
Another danger to the seed supply
lies in the possibility that growers
who have good seed of superior var
ieties may think it easier to sell it at
once to the oil mill instead of holding
it to sell for planting. This is a spe
cial danger in connection with the
new early-maturing long staple varie
ties. As only limited supplies of good
seed of these varieties are in exis
tence, it may be urged that all of this
should be saved for planting purposes.
There is an active and rapidly increas
ing demand fort the longer staples, .
with no immediate prospect cf over
production. The present demand is
likely to increase as fast as the sup
ply, if the production of such cotton
can be established on an adequate
so that manufacturers can have -the
same confidence is being able to' se
cure stocks of long staple cotton that
they have with short staples.
At the present time the supply of
long staple cotton, especially that
from 13-16 to 1 inch in length, is
much below the demand. This fact is
reflected in the large premiums being
paid for these extra staples. Prices
are now higher than at any time in
the history of cotton production.
