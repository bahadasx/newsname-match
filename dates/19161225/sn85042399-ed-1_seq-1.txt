Post-Mortems Held
On Street Corners
The mobilization of the three poll
ing places near the center of the city
made collecting election results easy
Tuesday evening, and a regular pro
cession of candidates and other inter
ested citizens made the round of the
counting places. The election boards
good-naturedly allowed a great deal
of peering over shoulders and gave
out the counts at each "breathing
spell."
Post-mortems on election results
occupied the attention of all the
street corner dopesters yesterday.
Some of the most frequently relter
ated conjectures and remarks fol
low:
"Wimer won because his popular
ity extended over the entire city or
else because his campaign extended
over the entire city. While each can
didate was very strong in hts own
ward, Wimer's vote was heavy in all
three."
"The cleanest recorder campaign
in years. Five fine men were de
feated." "Dr. Jarvls Is like the boy who
earned the money to buy a sled and
then had the sled broken before he
had a chance to go coasting."
"George Eubanks won In a walk."
"Only one new councilman."
"If the successful candidates make
good we will elect them again in
1918."
"By golly! I had It all doped
out." (Most frequent of all.)
"Say, wouldn't it Jar you?"
"Hurrah for ."
"I told you so."

Hombrook Ships
Car of Booze Daily
Liquor shipments to Oregon and
Washington from Hombrook are
growing heavier day by day. They
have reached such a volume that the
Southern Pacific Company leaves an
emptor express car at the Siskiyou
county town, to 'be filled each day.
This Is always full and a great many
times more is loaded on the train
when It pulls in. The Increase In
business 1b duo to the nearness of
the holidays and to tho anticipation
that Oregon will go "bone dry" after
the New Year.-
Jeter Buys Powell
Store Near Depot
William Jeter has purchased the
old reliable fruit store and supply
headquarters of Thad Powell, which
the latter has been conducting since
1910 at the corner of Fourth and A

liard hall and rooming apartments,

astic meeting of sportsmen and bust-! He finally succeeded In getting the

lug Rogue rlvor to commercial Hah- j protect the steelhead which Mr. Mac

to southern Oregon in the way of at- cannery men succeeded In slipping
tracting moneyed vacationists and re -
tired men wjio make fishing their
chief recreation,
A membership committee was ap
pointed consisting of Messrs. Jordan,
Hosier, Brown, Morris and Mowat,
and theso will solicit members be-
tween now and next Friday, when a
big meeting will bo held and a per
manent organization formed, officers
elected a.ul by-laws adopted.
Take Over Old Clubs.
Two clubs, tho Rod and Gun Club
and the old Ashland Gun Club, which
now are rot active, have a combined
membership of about 125, all of
whom w'.ll probably become active
members in tho new organization.
While the immediate purpose of rush
ing the organization Is to bring the
combined Influence of the .community
to bear at the January session of the
state legislature, which convenes
January 8, tho club will no doubt
become a valuable asset In, other
ways.
Fee.
A membership fee has not been
definitely settled. Tho Medford men
stated that their custom was to sell
cards to everyone at a dollar for the
year and to ask those of means to
pny a little more for their cards. A
Blmilar plan will no doubt be carried
out here. All of the citizens present
at the meeting signified their inteu
tlon of becoming momhers, and little
difficulty is anticipated In getting a
live membership of two. hundred or
more. , . . . -
E. D. Bilggs acted as temporary
chairman of tho meeting and Louis
Dodge is secretary. A free discus
sion of the imperative need of clos
ing the river in order to save the
fishing was indulged In following the
business meeting.
Medford Visitors.
Tom Hathaway, who has spent all
of his time for the past month in or
ganizing fish protective leagues in
Medford and other valley towns;
Chris Gottlieb, T. E. Daniels, Charles
Davis, Mr. Welscr and W. T. Grieve
of Medford were in attendance at tho
meeting and rendered valuable aid In
forming the temporary organization
and offering suggestions. All of the
visitors spoke briefly, telling of the
conditions which the movement was
fighting.
Tells History.
Mr. Gottliob outlined the history of
the closed river fight. He told how
the river had been closed by a two
to one vote of tho people of the state,
how Hume had retired from business
and Macley, tho present owner, bad
purchased the cannory for a mere
song. He stated: "Macley knew
that the river was closed, but is a
Business Men Make
Good Use of Books
The business men of tho city are
making free use of the business
man's library of forty-five books
which the state library has sent the
local library for a limited length of
time. From one-half to two-thirds
of the books are out all of the time,
and names are on the waiting list for
some of the best. Every phase of
almost every business is dealt with
and any business man can gain much
profit in spare minutes from making

the Ideas of others may be made use

Music Teachers

be invited at some time in the near

i through a bill reducing tbo mesh to
four Incncs. He told of the violations
of the law which are said to be com
mou at the rlvor mouth where Mac
ley's woid Is law; the reduced mesh
and the extended seanon. Ho gave a
graphic picture of the thousands of
salmon and stcclhead thrashing in
the nets :intil tho stoelhead were mu
tilated by the heavier salmon, and
the flshormcii throwing out the steel
head.. Mr. Gottlieb explained how
the touch of n human hund causes a
growth to start on a fish thrown back
Into tho water, which icon kills it.
"Until now tho seallons by the hun
dreds make tholr home at the moutli
of the Rogue to feed on the mutilated
Hteelhpad." Tho speaker stated that
he knew definitely of a number of
wealthy valley residents who mada
their home here chiefly because of
the Rogue river fishing, and named
several to clinch tho argument. He
stated that it was his belief that an
Investment of one million dollars in
this valley by wealthy men could 1)9

ffshlng and its charms for tho Invet
erate angler.
West's Veto.
E. D. Brlggs, who was one of the
commlttoo of three, tho other mem
bers being Gus Newberry and George
Putnam of Medford, who succeeded
in keeping the river closed a number
of years ago by appealing to the leg
islature and finally to Governor
West, toid of the many obstacles
which a delegation to the legislature-
would meet, and also told how, main
ly through George Putnam's influ
ence with Governor West, the gov
ernor had vetoed the open river bill..
Putnam at that time was a strong
advocate of a closed river.
Davis Talks.
Charlie Davis supplemented tho
previous remarks and told of the ef
forts Mackty had made to gain the
favor of the Rogue fishermen. He
spoke interestingly of the changed
policy of the Medford Mall Tribune
in regard to the closed river and
hinted strongly at a 'cause. .
The meeting closed with Informal
discussion of means by which favor
able legislation might be obtained, it
being the consensus of opinion that
the valley wan united as never before
on the proposition and that the leg
islature would bo forced to listen to
the plea of the population of the en
tire Rogue watershed in preference
to the manager of one concern at the
river's mouth.
An active campaign has begun for
members and a monster turnout l
anticipated at the meeting next Fri
day evening at 8 o'clock In the city
hall. A number of Medfordltes will
be up.
