During Past Week and

ONE DEMOCRAT PLANS TO
CONTEST OPPONENT'S SEAT i
Victory for Eikman and Illness
of Sen. Porter Would Put
the Democrats in the
Majority.
News-Times Special Service:
INDLVNAHOLIS, Ind.. Dec. 24.
Political Interest In Indiana still
ontinucs to center around the fu
sion of the coming senate. It is the
lir enigma of the situation and
;'lout it revolves the problems of
state-wl.ic prohibition, woman
. ulfrage, the liquor issue and prar
ticallv every platform pledge of
either of the bi parties In Indi-i
nna. 1
Sudden shifts In the lists of possi-j
hihties surrounding1 the senate ;
iime last week and at the close J
no one nere was pertain what party j
" . ould be in c ontrol of the body or
.hat laws would be enacted by the
legislature, because of the peculiar
sanation, which has lioon created by
the election of 2' republicans and
democrats to the body.
Defy the Democrats.
The republican senators met here
Saiurday and defied the democrats
to do their worst to block legisla
tion. They deterndned to gobble up
every bit of patronage that the sen
ate is heir to and to take and hold
ery political plum that may ap
pear during the legislature. State
Chairman Will II. Hays of the re
publicans sounded the keynote to
the meetin.cr, when he declared that
the republicans would be in con
trol, with Kdcar I. Hush, lieuten
ant -governor, voting with them and
that the republican party would bp
held responsible for the enactments
of the legislature. I'nder such con
ditions, the republican leader as-
erted. tilt
ahead ami
maintaining
Hush would
re publica lis w ould go
organize the senate,
that the ote of Mr.
otlicially hold good to
break a tie on any question.
The republicans were fortified in
thD position by an opinion from
Halph Kane of Xoblesville. former-
a republican state senator. Kane.
lio is said to have made a study
f the peculiar situation existing in
the senate, pave an opinion to tho
republicans, in which he advised
them to gr right ahead and "grab
cwrything in sight." Kane advised
Them that Bush's vote could count,
when a 1111 was up for passage, just
;is properly as at any other time, and
that his vote would give them con
trol of the uppr house.
Surprise in Store.
Meanwhile there possibly is a sur
prise or two up the sleeves of the
democratic statesmen here. A dozen
proposals for circumventing the re
publicans have been made, br.t prad
vally each has been set aside in its
proper niche, to be tried out when
the legislature convenes her Thurs
day. Jan. 4. Among the latest re
ported plans of the democrats to
obtain control of the upper house
and thus split the legislature so that
: mocratic legislation could be forc
ed through In Just as great measure
as republican statutes, are two which
are worth discussing.
One is based on the theory that
,sfn. Porter, a republican of Wash
ington. Ind.. is ill and possibly will
be able t" nttend but a few sessions
of the senate. If he wem kept away
the democrats would control, unless
I.:eut.-ov. Hush's claims to a vote
were upneld. Then a tie would re
mit agi-in.
Will on trt VAn tioii.
Another possibility lbs in the fact
that it was reported her- today that
S-m. Edward Eikman of New Hal
stjne. Hancock -ounty. will con
test the election of I-m P. Io';yns
of ;re.-nburg. a republican, who
was elected at tile rwent election

NEW YORK. Dec. 24. That many
Germans who had been interned as
prisoners in England, as well as a
number of Englishmen, desirous of
escaping service, have been smug
gled Into this country as coal trim
mers on board various liners. It was
intimated here today. The case of
William Farrell, also known as Ker
nahan, for whom a writ of habeas
corpus was sworn out in the federal
court, was said to have led to the
disclosures.
Farrell, a coal trimmer on board
the British steamship Adriatic, had
been placed In Irons, it was charg
ed, because he declared that if he
were permitted to go ashore he
would not return to the vessel. The
writ of habeas corpus sworn out in
his behalf directed Capt. Hansom of
the Adriatic to produce Farrell be
fore the court. This, however, the
captain refused to do. .stating that
the mere fact ' of bringing Farrell
ashore would liberate him. Judge
Hough, who heard the argument,
dismissed the writ.

Vatican Organ
Has Praise for
Wilsons Note
Associated Press Service.
HOME, Dec. 2 3. The Osservatorf
Ilomano, the official organ of the
Vatican, in reference to Hres't Wil
son's note to the belligerents, says:
"It wishes to express full satisfac
tion for the-very important docu
ment" by which the authoritative
voice of the head of the great Amer
ican repubhc calls the warring par
ties to "consider their grave respon
sibilities" and advises mean's to
hasten the end of the war. It recalls
that Pope Benedict also made vir
tually the same attempt in July,
1913. The newspaper closes with a
comment by expressing the hope
that the note will be favorably re
ceived. Hope Benedict, who had been in
formed regarding the note slnr.e
Monday last, expressed the hope
that it would have a beneficial ef
fect, despite its coincidence with
Cermany proposal of peace, with
which, it was pointed out, it must
not be connected.
REPUBLICANS TO
ADOPT A POLICY
Gardner Explains Opposition
to Mann is Due Purely to
His "Prussianism."
Assoei.ited Press Service:
WASHINGTON. Dec. 24. Agita
tion for a conference of house re
publicans to outline a definite plan
of constructive action during this
and the next congress to replace the
present policy of merely opposing
democratic proposals began today
to take definite form.
Upon his return from Cincinnati,
where he announced his opposition
to Republican leader Mann for
speaker of the next house and his
support of Hep. lyenroot of Wiscon
sin for the place. Hep. Gardner of
Massachusetts said he would imme
diately seek to have a conference
called for the purpose of "formu
lating policies" for the future.
He made it clear that his effort
to obtain a conference should be
entirely disassociated from his op
position to Mr. Mann, which he says
is based solely on his conviction that
Mr. Mann stands for "Prussia and
Prussianism" in international af
fairs. Until Mann indorsed Pres't
Wilson's recent peace message.
Gardner said he favored him.
Hep. Lenroot evinced keen inter
est in the conference proposal and
said he favored a similar plan but
declined to discuss the speakership
situation as he constantly had done
since his friends began urging him
to get into the race openly.
Coincident with the return of Mr.
Gardner it r.ecame known that he
recently conferred with Col. Roose
velt on the house situation. Other
than saying that a conference had
!een held, however. Mr. Gardner de
clined to discuss the meeting. Hep.
SJchall of Minnesota, one of the two
progressives elected to the next
house, also is in receipt of an in
vitation to call on Col. Roosevelt.
In political circles the colonel's ac
tivity is interpreted as indicating
that he intends to take more than a
passing interest in the organization
of the house.

NEW YORK. Dec. 24. When the
great "tree of light" flashed into life
in Madison Square Garden at six
o'clock tonight the official celebra
tion of Christmas was begun in New
York. Trumpet calls toward the
four corners of the earth by trumpet
ers in v. hite and gold were answer
ed by an Indian chant and carols
from a volunteer choir. Moro than
1,000 voices as the lUhts were turn
ed on answered. Six .hours later
prayers for world peace were offer
ed at midnight mass in the Roman
Catholic churches of the city.
Hut the distribution of Christmas
cheer for the city's poor did not
wait for nightfall. Rolice stations
throughout the greater city were
literally transformed into great
storehouses for gifts of all descrip
tions intended for the needy. Trees
had been provided in some of the
station houses, while others were
decorated with Christmas greens and
Hags. The police themselves acted
as Santa Clauses in distributing the
presents for the poor. They also
provided entertainment in the way
of motion pictures, vocal and in
strumental music and games.
Many Hearts GlaMonexl.
Of the approximately 25,000
children, whose hearts were glad
dened by the police, many were
crippled from the epidemic of in
fantile paralysis lat summer. In
front of several of the station houses,
the crowds of small girls and boys
were so large, that traffic was su
spended. Most of these children came
from the tenements and but for the
police, they probably would have
gone without toys and other holiday
gifts.
The Salvation Army has arranged,
it was announced, to care for the
largest number of persons in its his
tory at its dinner for the poor to
morrow. The Volunteers of America
tonight distributed 500 baskets, each
containing a dinner for from five
to 10 persons. Five hundred dinners
also have been provided for poor
families by the Mohawk Democrat

wealthy woman living on Riverside

families for the rest of the winter,
providing them with clothing, food,

Organization Abandons Cus
tom of Several Years'
Standing.
Hoor children who have been the
guests of the members of the Elks'
lodge at Christmas tree parties at
the clubhouse for several years, are
being provided for by other charit
able organizations this season and
the organization has abandoned its
annual custom. Hearty co-operation
among the members in other move
ments has been given and it was- de
cided to eliminate this feature of the
charitable work of the lodge.
Each year several hundred little
children, whose families are too poor
to bring Santa Claus into their
home.", have been made g'ad by th
Elks' club. A Christmas tree has
been erected every year in the audi
torium cf the clubhouse and on the
afternoon of Christmas day the
Santa Claus, who could not visit
the poor homes, ha? passed out lit
tle presents and candy to the chil
dren. This year the Chri.-tmas party
has be3n given up. owing to the boy
scout movement that is being foster
ed by the organization. Many boys
of the city, some of them being
children, who have attended the tree
festivals, are being taught military
training and a broad education is
being given to them in this way.
Karl O. King, secretary of the dub.

felt that as much good was being
done in this way a in giving th"
