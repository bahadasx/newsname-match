WHAT GERMANY
IS PREPARED TO

From Berlin, Says Teutons
Are Willing to Go Far in
Concessions to End War,
READY TO INDEMNIFY
BELGIUM FOR LOSSES
GRANT, AND WHIT

Discuss Peace Terms Until
King Albert's Territory Is
Evacuated by Kaiser,
What Germany will concede ami
what the allies will demand as condi
tions for ending the war, prohahly are
M-t forth with fair accuracy in the
following dispatch from Curl W. Ae k
eiinan in Berlin, and in the subjoined
iiiiiele from Providence ( li. I.i Joui-
nal, which usually ha spoken in
country, with greatest aceiiracy,
this
the
pollcieK of the Hritish government.
That Germany may grant more is
possible, and that the allies may make
peace with less than is indicated, is
probable.
The following Is an excerpt from Mr.
Ae-kermnn s dispatch from Berlin:
Ackermaii's Matcnieiit.
"The next step will he Germany's,
as soon as the formal reply of the
allies, which. London dispatches say,
will hp along the lines covered by
Lloyd George in his speech yesterday,
reaches Berlin. Diplomatic circles
which enjoy tho confidence of the
Teutonic representatives were positive
today that the central powers will try
to meet the Hritish position. Ger
many, these diplomats say, is willing
to Bo far to restore pence. She is
willing, it is believed, to:
"First. Guarantee the future if her
enemies will do so. This guaran
tee) undoubtedly would take the form
of partial disarmament and the crea
tion of a league of nations to compel
pence through an international court.
".Second. Indemnify Belgium and
Lux. mburg and very likely consent to
i'i s'tonj, of .'T'dn "'1 iV'i'itr
ricgro if a peace conference should de
cide such action was wise.
"Third. I'se her influence to permit
Itulv to retain the territory captured
1 v it during- the present war
from
Austria.
"Fourth. Agree to a withdrawal
from France and Belgium If absolute
ly guaranteed that the entente itself
will agree to a peace conference which
will be given complete authority to
end the war.
"It can be stated on authority that
Germany does not believe that the
territorial stains of 1IM4 furnishes a
real basis for peace. The contrary is
t ho case. The Balkans must, be re
organized, the Germans believe, so
that their position as "firebrands
of 1
i
Kurope" will be eliminated.
"Against the entente demand for
indemnities for France and other na
tionsexcept Belgium and Luxem
burg Germany is expected to inter
pose demands for indemnity for the
overrunning of East Prussia, while
Austria-Hungary will ask recompense
for invasion by Russia. H admittedly
is the German belief that if a peace
conference can be arranged the ques
tion of Indemnity will lie dropped by
both sides, excepting that for Belgium.
"The next few days will be fraught
with serious developments. On them
will depend whether the way can lie
kept open for negotiations. All of the
neutral nations '"'- ,lst'
their influence to prevent either bel
ligerent from shutting the door to ne
gotiations. And officials here say that
In their opinion the chances are
about equally divided.
"In this connection, however, it is
known that Germany is relying on
Great Britain bringing France and
Bussia around from their seemingly
irreconcilable attitude against a peace
conference. Any move by Germany
from now on is expected to be along
lines designed to influence Great Bri
tain, wlio will then be expected to
hold her allies under control."
The article from the Providence
Journal follows:
The I jiK'iiIv Deniiimls.
"The answer of the allied powers
will say that they stand for peace:
that they have always stood for peace,
that there is no disposition on their
part to ignore any proposition honest
ly put. forth looking toward the con
clusion of a war disastrous to civili
zation and humanity. It will declare
the firm conviction that Germany's
proposals lire fraudulent; that they
are deliberately put forth to create
public sentiment in favor of her
cause: that they mean less than noth
ing, and that there is only one way
by which the Teutonic government?
can come before the bar of public
opinion in this matter in any honor
able way.
"The allied governments will state
that even if any suggestion of a peace
parley could be contemplated at this
time the allies will never consent to
go one inch in that direction unl'd
Germany voluntarily withdraws from
the entire territory of Belgium, and by
that act shows her willingness to ap
proach somewhat nearer the level of
the civilized nations with which she
seeks to treat.
"The withdrawal from Belgium, in
other words, will be made sine qua
non for any movement looking to a
conference. By this demand the allies
will seek to bring plainly before the
world, and to emphasize among the
people of the neutral nations and
particularly the people of the I'nited
States, the fact that they have never
retreated from their original attitude
with regard to the violation of Bel
gium. "The conferences that have been
held in London during the last four
days between the ambassadors of P.us
sia, France and Italy and British cab
inet officers have niadu it apparent

they have no desire to ci ush or humil

in Madison Square Garden at li o'clock
tonight, the official i eleliiat ion of
Christmas was berjui. Trumpet calls
toward the four corners of the earth
by trumpeters in white and gold were
answered by an Indian chant and
