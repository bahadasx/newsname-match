Also Broken.
Hsntn Claus, who was unable to com
plete his rounds last night distributed
thousands of gifts In Washington to
day, employing all tho regular and
extra carriers at the postottlce. twen
ty automobiles, and thirty horse
drawn vehicles.
The Christmas gifts distributed to
day camo fj-om all parts of the United
Btatcs and several foreign countries.
Will Dellve Them All.
It Is expected that most of the day
will be required to deliver the great
volumo of boxes, packages, and let
ters which friends and relatives have
sent to Washington. a
Postmaster Merrill O Chance and
C. K. Bchooley, superintendent of car
riers, at the local postofTlce, said the
corps of men and vehicles would be
kept on the Job until every package
was delivered.
The outgoing department of the
local postofTlce was as quiet as a
graveyard, nnd all of the employes
wore enjoying the Christmas holiday,
thanks to compliance by Washing
tonlans with the "mall earl" re
quest. Due to l.ate Tralas.
The great activity In the Incoming
department and tho enlarged volume
of lata mall Is attributed to tho fact
that practically all trains from the
West are from ono to fourteen hours
late because of a snowstorm and be
cause of a shortage of cars In the
Usst.
Postmaster Chance remained at the
office until late last night. He re
turned at i. o'clock this morning on!
remained until I o'clock.
The high tide In the arrival of
Christmas mall was resetted between
these hours, and the entire force was
kept busy opening and sorting out the
contents of the mountains of sacks.
On Vy Hy .
Jty noon practically all of the mall
had been placed In automobiles and
wagons, and Postmaster Chance said:
"Notwithstanding the fact that the
Christmas mall 'was between .10 and
-10 per cent heavier this year than
last, the postofrice is clearer of pack
ages and letters today than It hss
been on any Christmas day In Its his
tory.
"All of the regular and extra car
rlera r-portrd at the postofflcn at 5
o'clock this morning, and two hours
later began the delivery of letters,
Kach of the men carried all tho mall
he could navigate with, and automo
biles loaded with additional Christ
mas nutter m-l the carriers on their
routes and gave them many addl
llonal sacks for distribution.
.'isny Misdirected Packages.
"The tragic -side of Christmas haste
was seen in the bureau of tho post
offen dealing with misdirected mall.
More than 10,000 packages and let
lera, chiefly the lattor, were Improp
eily addressed to Washlngtonlans.
and a corps of about twenty men and
women was kept busy consulting -til-rectories
to help out fisnts Claus."
rleveral hundred Washlngtonlans
also failed properly to address thlsr
packages and letters, and several
shrives were filled with parcels sent
back to the Capitol.
Wrappings llroken.
A laige number of paikages were
Improperly wrapped, and the con
tents of the boxes and paper filled
several baskets. Among the articles
which burst out of paper w rappers,
the covering having been lost, were a
numbr of armadillo baskets, unmls
takably sent by members of the Jls
trlct National Guard on the Mexican
border to relatives and friends at
home.
There also were a groat many
broken and crumbled cakes, cartons
of eggs, which had broken und leaked
oer other matter, and crockery and
china articles,
In one corner of the office several
clerks were busy sending notices to
people all over the United States that
packages or letters wero In tho local
office for them, and advising them to
send postage.
Fully 2,000 packages, letters, and
postal cards were mailed by Washlng
tonlans who noglected to place
stamps upon tbem.

READY FOR FINAL DRIVE
Country Believes Germany Is
In Distress and That
Viotory Is Near.
PAHIB, Die. M.Oen. Hubert Lyau
tey has become war dictator of France
and with a growing conviction that
the various peace moves can have no
other reason than Herman necessity.
France Is stripping herself for the
final drive which she feels sure will
bring viotory.
The passing of the supreme power
Into Lyautey's hands was simple and
not attended with any 'of the nglta
tlon which marked the recent minis
terial crisis.
At a meeting of the new war coun
cil last night, Lyautey, who had been
called from Morocco to become min
ister of war, attended for tho first
time. The council decided "that all
questions concerning tho' preparation
and carrying on of the war will be
under tho direction of the war minis
ter, and that he will notify the In
terested ministers and the generals-In-chtef
of the decisions taken and
assure tho co-ordlnatton necessary to
their execution."
Hop to Knd Agitation.
This action Is expected to end the
agitation which has been disturbing
France for months.
The demand has been for a dic
tator, a man who could Insure the
focusing of the wholo power of the
nation on the batle front, and It Is
believed that in this action, and In
the choice of Lyautey, who la re
garded as the ablest administrator In
France, the demand will be satisfied.
Kvldence of this came last night
also In the unanimous vote of the
filiate of confidence In the Ilrland
ministry. The Senate also voted
unanimously that France could not
discuss peace with an enemy so lonr
an It had soldier on French terri
tory. DIsTercat .Vow.
France for a long time refused to
take much stock In the stories of Ger
man Internal troubles, economic diffi
culties, starvation and that kind of
thing. The Information here, which
was carefully gathered, did not lead
the authorities to believe them.

Snow Almost Only Touch of
Holiday Atmosphere in
Grim Scenes.
LONDON, Dec. 25. Not even Christ,
mas cheer stoprs-d war's maiming to
day. Reports from every front dla
closed slight let-up In the business
of killing. London Itself celebrated,
but with a cheer, tinged with sorrow
for loved ones lost and a reconsecra
tlon for the future. London's main
manifestation of the Christmas spirit
was furnished In the elaborate ar
rangements made to give furloughtd
Tommies a real taste of cheer and
home-comforts. There were thous
ands of khaki-clothed warriors who
came over from France to spend the
holldsy at home or, If not at home,
In friendly hands.
Snow made real Christmas sur
roundings on nearly every front. It
traced a covering of the trenches In
the Vosges, on the western front; It
Interposed a natural obstacle to un
limited fighting on the east.
Beth SJ4a laswsa la.
High up in the Carpathians tbe
Ilusslsns and Germans were locked;
and south. In 'the daxxjlng whiteness
of tbe peaka of the Alps, the Italians

both sides were "snowejd In."

In the past, but It was symbolical of the

ain second to the nation's needs, and
the officials for the most part were right

WORLD LEAGUE POSSIBLE
United States Might Give' Up
Monroe Doctrine for
Broader Ideal.
Following close on the action of
the Swiss government In aligning
Itself behind President Wilson, practi
cally alt the neutral nations of the
world are declared today to be on tho
point of Joining In a great peace
plea.
Intimations already have been re
ceived hero that some other of thn
leading neutral nations will have
given their hearty assent to the
President's plea for peace "before the
year Is out '
Holland Is believed to be one of
the countries, and It Is llkIy to act
at once, and it Is rumored today also
that Spain may come through with a
message of peace.
Real Cans f or feejeletaa.
The hope and belief of Administra
tion officials In such an outcome
within the new year was strength
ened by SwIUerland'a action and the
tenor of the Swiss note approving
President Wilson's peace More and
offering the mountain republic's bit
toward halting the world atruggltf
and seeing- tbat peace Is permanent.
Hence, this Christmas Day Ameri
can officials felt that thero Is real
cause for rejolcelnr. despite the faet
that the blr guns Will do; their
slaughter abroad. , i
SwIUerland'a tiote of approval
came to light last night After 8wlas
Minister Hitter had -consulted with'
the President. Addressed to all bel
ligerents, with a copy sent to neu
trals, It declared the President's peace
note will find a "mighty echo" in
Swltserlarid.

Furthermore. It declare that tbe
republic, "situated like ; an Island
amidst the ses thing .waves of -the ter
rible world war, supports Wilson a
plan; would "coalder itself happy It
It could act In any, no matter how
modest, a way," to end the war and
to assist In reaching a permanent
peace.
The most significant thing of the
whole note Is that Bwltstrland aows
the seed of an International league
for peace enforcement by Its ex
pressed willingness to aid In establish
ing "the foundation for a beneficial
cooperation of the people." This -f
the more Important from thn fact that
the United States and Switzerland
have worked In harmony. And hli
Government hajC apprised 8wltxerl,snd
and o.uer neutrals of Its actions, eveii

fldencc.
We rid Guaranty ef Peaee.
The Idea of an International guar
anty of peace squares with recent
official expressions In this country fa
vorlng such a plan. It seemed more
certain than ever today that, If
necessary, this Government will oast
the Monroe Doctrine overboard, Join
what has hitherto been regarded as
an "entangling alliance," and, help
with other neutrals In securing a per
manent peace.
The State Department waa closed
today, except for the cable office.
There, an operator and a code cleik
stood watch thn whole time ror word
from Kurope that would give officio
light on the answer to President Wil
son's pesce note or to Germany's
overtures. Authorities doubted, bow
ever, that this vigilance would ba re
warded Just now.
Dut the press reports gave them a
more optimistic outlook than they
had Immediately after Wilson's note
went abroad.
This with the neutral backing made
It look more like Merry Christmas In
the National Capital than for two
years past. r

uppermost" In his mind, but he made
no reference either to the German
