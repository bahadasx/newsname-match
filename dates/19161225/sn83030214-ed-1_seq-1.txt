Aecording to this theory. Mr. Wils.
came abruptly to the conclusion th

he could insure the stability of t!

Re'hmann -Hollweg has been lotte

demanding a ruthie?? submarino car

the applause ot" the people. The pea
overturn of 'welve day? ago is b?lier?

lor there m only one thing, it is b
liered, dearer to the (ierman poop
than a yigorou? prosecution of th? wi

had fallen altogether on barren groan

therefore, can be regarded by th

for the ft^st time. Th? council de?

Thil a?*tlon is expected to end th?|
agitation which ha? been disturbing

Dictator Ha? Been Memandt-d
The demand haa b??en for a die-?
tator, a man who could insure the
focussing of the whole power ??f tha
nation on the battle front, and it 13
believed that in this action ard in,
the. choice of Lyautey, who ii re?
garded aa the ablest administrator
in France, the demand will be sat
isfie-d.
Evidence of this crime !a.?r night, ai?-?,
in the unanimous rote of ?he Senate ef

reetly from the present peace move?,

draw the inference that the time foe

ing. N% one believes that ?o ma: t

would have been made simultaneou? a
unies? in?pired l'y Germany.
Eviden?-?? In Au?tria
There Is more direct evidence. It*}
the first place, there i? the direct ?tat??
ment of the Papal Nuncio In Viennf*.
that the Austrian Emperor asked tr?o
Tope to interc?de for peace. Then
there are the disorganization and re,
cent rapid changes in the Austrian
Cabinet, all pointing directly to dm-?
?ion? in Austria-Hungary on the que?,
tion of Germanophile policy.
Tneae divisions and the request to
the Pope unratetakabl** indicate differ-*
encea between the Centra! Empire?.
Beyond that are the German, Amen?
can and Sw*1.?? note?. The OOBClaiioa
i.? not to be avoided that there are ?e.
rlou? internal difficulties in Gerrniarv
a? ?veil as between the member? of t1 a
