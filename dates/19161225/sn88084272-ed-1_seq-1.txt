Mail Will Be Four to Ten
Days Late Throughout the
Country, It Is Stated.
Chicago, I1L, Dec. 25. Thousands of
sacks of first class and parcel post mail
are blockaded in the railroad terminals
here. Coming from every direction in
the country simultaneously, the Christ
mas mail overwhelmed the railroads
and delivery and are said to be four
or five days behind. Outgoing mall
also is delayed. Every train running
out of Chicago has four or five extra
mail cars.
"Mail will be four to ten days late
throughout the country." said Leroy
Stewart, head of the city delivery di
vision of the postoffice. "One of the
reasons for the great delay Is that
nearly everybody mailed Christmas
cards in sealed envelopes this year.
These cards are delaying the delivery
of package mails.
Chicago Office Is Behind.
"It will take at least a week for the
Chicago opstoffice and the railroad ter
minals to dispose of the mail that is
coming here. There are 50 wagons de
livering parcel post and it will take the
carriers all day to deliver the one trip
scheduled for today."
"The mail now in Chicago terminals
does not belong here," said Capt E. L.
West, superintendent of the middle
west railway mail service division. "It
is being transferred from one railroad
to another to be taken to the different
sections of the country. I have called
for more cars from the railroads, but
they were unable to supply them."

DRAYER of a World Answered
When Christ Is Born On Earth
His Birth Amid Lowly Surroundings Sanctifies Poverty and Gives to the World

By Rev. Fr. J. H. Maloney, of the Diocese of EI Paso.
"He came nnto His Own, and His own
received Him not."
WITH no place to lay His head,
save the manger of a deserted
stable with no one to pay Him
homage, save Mary and Joseph, with no
one to herald His coming save a multi

tidings with a few neighboring shep
herds. What I a.k you. did the birth

Transporting ourselves in spirit to

great roads congested with the mighty
hordes of travelers answering the royal
decree. In the midst of this vast con
course of gaily caparisoned equipages,
with the occupants robed in rarest furs

the surging crowds, and frequently are
forced to the road side to make way

They have forsaken humble Nazareth to

About 20 dugouts were destroyed by
