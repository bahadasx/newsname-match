Nothing, After All, Is Quite Like
Christmas In the United States
(Editor's Note —The Times'
editorial staff drew lots to
see who should have the
"day off" on Christmas day.
Edgar C. Wheeler was a
lucky one. But his sister,
who has arrived in Tacoma
from India just in time for
Christmas, volunteered to
tell her impressions of going
to a Tacoma church Sun
day.)
By M. Louise Wheeler
After five years of life under
sunny Indian skies, it was with
the same thrill of childhood that
I stepped out into the wintry air
of Christmas Sunday to look out
across the Sound to whole islands
and hills of Christmas trees —to
see the holly wreaths in tlie win
dows of Tacoma homes, and to
step once more into a Christian
home church, radiating the love
of the Christ-child through the
peal of the great organ, the vest
ed choir, the wreaths, garlauds
and Christmas trees, and best of
all, the warm genial welcome of
brotherhood in the spirit of
Christmas.
Home again! Home In a land
where the flag of freedom waves
and the Christmas child, whether
we feel it or not, is king. Have
you felt the thrill, the warmth of
this Christmas time? You would,
had you missed it for five years
and then stepped into it again as
I did Sunday morning; in the First
Presbyterian church.
How It Is There.
But it is also Chirstmas day
in India, and the same love is
there and the same "Peace on
Karth" will chime from the stone
tower of the Indian Christian
church. The same joy will be in
the hearts of some of our Indian
brothers and the same excitement
and anticipation in the hearts of
the little brown children.
They all come to the Christmas
service—fathers in white, blue,
pink and yellow, in sandals in-
stead of the usual bare feet;
women with their lone; yards of
cloth draped for di esses, bare
feet or red leather shoes with the
toes turned up, their glass, gold
and silver, bangles niu) silver
anklets jingling in rhythm with
each movement, with a -laughing
or silent, contented babe on each
mother's' hip. They are coming
in groups to church, whole fami
lies together. Sandals are left
outside, and they gather silently

a place of Scrooge.
But what did Scrooge care! It
.vas the very thing he liked.
Once upon a time — of all the
good days tn the year, on Christ
mas eve—old Scrooge sat busy In
bis counting-house. It was cold,
bleak, biting weather; foggy, with
al.
The door of Scrooge's counting
house was open, that he might
keep his eye upon his clerk, who
ln a dismal little cell beyond, was
copying letters. Scrooge had a
very small fire, but the clerk's
fire as so very much smaller that
in aisles on long benches.
There is no cold, brisk air, no
snow; there are no holly berries,
and no Christmas trees, but there
are branches of green foliage and
the warm soft air of a June day is
fragrant with the odor of roses.
There is no pipe organ to thrill
one until the joy is so deep that
the tears come, but the . boys
have brought their clappers, small
Indian drums, and the old famil
iar carols fill the air, though
they are sung in strange words.
No Vested Choir There.
There too, the Indian pastor
brings to the waiting people the
message of love and Christian
brotherhood, not with the train
ed thinking of our seminaries and
universities, perhaps, but with
the simple directness of one who
"loves much."
There is no vested choir, no
trained soloist, no prelude and
postlude from great composers,
