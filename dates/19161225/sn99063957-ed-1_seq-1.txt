room of the Marion hotel and sat them
down before a table on which were
snowy linen, sparkling cut glass, and
a delicious brown turkey.
It was like a trip into fairyland for
the youngsters who were given this
treat because of the kiudneBs of the
"King.' And in their eyes "Bill"
Lerchen was a really and truly King.
And their eyes danced with keen antici
pation at tho unusual feast.
The Christmas cheer struck deep in
to their hearts ant? they thoroughly en
joyed everything set before them.
"Gee," whispered one youngster to an
other, "ain't this grand?" rMd the
other replied, "You betcha"
Ono little fellow was standing apart
from the rest and King Lerchen walk
ed over to him and asked what he was
doing there, and he bravely replied:
"I'm looking 'for the King, and I 'm
going to stay here till I see him." Bill
laughed and told him he was the king

it's so darn high we haven't had any

Von Mackensen Takes Charge
of New Drive in Dobmdja
Section
London, Dec. 25 Not even Christmas
cheer stopped war's maiming today.
Reports from every front disclosed,
slight letup in the busirtbss of killing.
London itself celebrated, but with a
cheer, tinged with sorrow for loved ones
lost and a re-consecrution for tho future.
I London's ujinn manifestation of tho
I Christinas spirit was furnished in the
j elaborate arrangements made to give
j f iirloughed Tommies a real taste ot
cheer nnd home comforts- There were
thousands of khaki clad warriors whoj
came over from France to Bpend the
holiday at home or, if not at home, in
friendly hands.
Snow made real Christmas surround
ings on nearly every front. It traced a
covering of the trenches in the Vosges,
on the western front; it interposed a
natural obstacle to unlimited fighting
on the east. High up in the Carpathians
the Russians and Germans wore locked;
and south, in the dazzling whiteness of
the peaks of the Alps, the Italians and
Australians still fought each other from
trenches dizzily planted on height and
tn viilliiv In Atneerlonia both sides

I rudja did not. detail the weather, but
indicated perhaps the most vigorous of
lall warfare of the day in progress. Field
Marshal Von Mackensen has switehed
from his drive of the Teutonic troops
north from Bucharest, to take eharge of
a new and violent offensive directed
i against the Russians in Dobmdja.
Here in London, nearly all of Bri
tain's officials stuck closely at their
desks planning ahead. Christmas nsual
lv found all officials holiday vacation
ing in the past, but it was symbolical
of the new order, installed by Premier
Lloyd-George, that personal comfort
this year came second to the nation's
needs nnd the officials, for tho most
part, were right on the job. Premier
Lloyd-Gsorge himself set an example in
this regard, foregoing all pleas of his
family to spend a Christmas at his home
in Wales. He also expects to accomp
lish some work at his office today. So
do most, of the other cabinet officers.
