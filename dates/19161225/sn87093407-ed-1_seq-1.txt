Chief Registration Clerk Wttkrni A. Games proved
himself a regular Santa Glaus to the cause of Nonpar
tisanship Monday, and lent a new impetus to the cam
paign for signatures.
He announced that he has arranged his office force
so as to be able to check up the signatures on Nonpar
tisan petitions as late as Thursday night.
"I will work a shift thruout ihe whole night, if nec
essary," he informed Oliver T. Erickson, president of
the Washington Nonpartisan league.

On Friday, December 29. the
nonpartisan petitions must be in
the hands of Secretary of State
Howell The law requires the in
Itiatlve bills to be filed with him
10 davs before the legislature con
venes
Some question lias arisen as to
how many signatures the nonpar
tisan petition needs. The law
says It must have 10 per cent of
the total cast for governor at the
last election. Secretary of State
Howell savs It requires 37,761
names, basing the figures on the
election of November 7. 1912.

The nonpartisan bill, however,
was presented for circulation and
filed at Olvinpia before that elec
tion. and many lawyers believe It
would only require 10 per cent of
the g"b< rnatorial vote of 1912, or
approximately 32,000.
Seattle. Spokane and Taeonia
have so far furnished 21,000 signa
ture*. Prom (he smaller districts,
another 7,000 or 8,000 signatures
are expected.
Tliis means that the nonpartisan
