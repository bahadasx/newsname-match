FAIR A
Ik Friday Saw Greatest C
Here. Full Premit
K Depar
/ Friday, the fifth and biggeBt day of
the Third Lancaster County Fair, was
(Educational Day, aLd it drew the
greatest crowd ever assembled in
Lancaster. Cloudless, crisp, cool
weather made an ideal day for such
a gathering and a crowd estimated
at between eight and ten thousand
pamcipaicu ana witnessea the event
of the day. At a few minutes
before 11 o'clock, the school parade
proceeded from the Central School
on its way through thronged streets,
marching nearly all of the way down
Main street and returning the same
way. At the head of the parade rode
Chief Orr, head of the police department,
and several other mounted
policemen, Chief Marshal U. Cunningham
and a number of other
marshals and fair committeemen.
Following close came a very creditable
school float from ltich Hill. This
was decorated in autumn leaves and
bore several suggestive mottoes,
among others the school slogan,
"Our Ideals, Three-in-One?Physical.
Mental, Moral." Inside the float
were several high school pupils and
other representatives of the school
came behind on foot. Next came
Riverside in the line of march and
then Antioch, whose original floats |
attracted much attention. In from
was a representation from life of the J
teaching of a recitation, the teacher
presiding over a modern school room.
This float was attractively decorated.
Just behind and attached to the
dffst, was another float representing!
The 'old-field" type of school, with
older pupils seated on split log
benchea. spelling out their lessons.
Following in order came the Caston.
Cralgville, Ferguson, Van Wyck and
Douglas schools, all of which made
good showings.
Next in order came a float which
attracted much attention, that of the
night school at the Lancaster Cotton
Mills. The automobile was covered
with the white cotton fabric manufactured
at the mill, with festoons of
soft cotton, strings of shuttles covered
the framework and the 'harness"
and other parts of the mill
machinery were suggestive of the
work which engages the labors of
these workers who devote two nights
each week to study. Flags of the
State and nation decorated this float
and the school's enrollment was
given as 123.
The "Red Rose" float was covered
with white and strewn with red
roses, while ten prety little maids
appeared with flower faces, sparkling
eyes and bright cheeks peeping out
from red rose petals surrounded by
green leaves. This effective floa,
represented the Central School o.
Lancaster.
Dry Creek came next in line of
march and made a good showing.
Immediately following came the
beautiful mfll school float, a white
draped automobile, covered with red
hearts and soft ropes of cotton. Miss
Ruth Riddle, clad entirely in white,
representing the "Queen of Hearts,"
drove the car and behind stood the
imperial figure of His Majesty Lawson
Caldwell, representing "King
Cotton" in his robes of -state. The
imperial figure was clad In a red robe,
trimmed In cotton ermine. He wore
a kingly crown and wielded a sceptre
of state. I
The automobile parade followed
that of the schools, having been
postponed from Thursday on account
of the rain that day. Miss Kate McManus
drove a beautifully decorated
car, in which yellow chrysanthemums
formed the color motif. With
Miss McManus, who was dressed in
yellow and black, rode several young
women similarly attired and a dog
with big upstanding bow of yellow
ribbon sat next to MIhb McManus at
I the steering wheel.
Mr. J. M. Yoder's car, decorated
in flags and farm products, Attracted
M much atentlon. With Mr. and Mrs.
>*Sl Yoder rode several members of their
asi family and other relatives. A numWr
of other cars followed In the pap
' rade.
