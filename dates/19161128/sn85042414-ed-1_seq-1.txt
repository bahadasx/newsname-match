Quoted In an official British communi

The Berlin statement follows: "The

our naval forces again executed a raid
going close to the English coast. Not
far from Lowestoft an enemy patrol
vessel and its crew were captured.
Some neutrals also were stopped and
searched, but carried no contraband.

BRITISH RECAPTURE BOAT
German Submarine Seised Norwegian

parts from the custom of-sinking all
ships he meets and follows in a par

On November..IS, according to the
statement, a German submarine cap
tured the Norwegian steamer Older,
bound from Newport for Gibraltar
and. placed a prize crew aboard the
vessel. For a time the submarine ac
companied thep rize and "continued
acts of piracy on other ships" but
eventually the Older diverged appar

the prize crew are now prisoners.
FRANCE WILLING TO fAST

Paris, Nov. 28.—The question of the

pleased to call a dictator, is a leading
topic of the day, coupled with string
ent economic measures now under
consideration, such as meatless days,
the suppression of fancy pastry, in
creased inland postal rates, and the
income tax.
The question of meatless days Is
readily accepted-as a'rule, for, as one
writer says, France for centuries fast
ed one day a week and was none the
worse for it.
.The general note sounded by edi
torial writers is that the eountry is
prepared for all and any sacrifices
which are shown to be necessary as

Suspected Hoof and Mouth
Cases Draw Extensive
Quarantine.
Kansas City Stock Yards
the Center of a Vigorous
Investigation.
Kansas City, Mo., Nov. 28.—The
stock yards of this city are the center
of the federal investigation of a possi
ble outbreak of hoof and mouth dis
ease among cattle shipped in here a
week ago, and a dozen states have
taken the precautions of proclaiming
a quarantine not only against Kansas
City stock yards, but against live
stock shipments from the states of
Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois.
Until the nature of the disease
found among the cattle shipped here
from the farm of John Schmidt, near
Tescott, Kansas, a portion of which
was shipped to a farm near Wauneta,
Nebraska, has been fully determined
there will be no further shipments to
or from this locality except for im
mediate slaughter.
The United States department of
agriculture is taking every precau
tion to prevent the spread of the dis
ease, whether hoof and mouth infec
tion or something else. The depart
ment is making inoculation and other
tests and it will be several days be
fore it can be definitely learned
whether the malady is the dread
scourge,
Kxperts Flocking In.
Live stock experts from Illinois
,awd other states-are on tHeir way to
this city to assist in the work of pre
caution and to study the disease, as
it now exists.
The calves, hogs and horses which
have been inoculated with virus tak
en from the suspected cattle have
shown no signs as yet of the effect of
the serum. However, veterinarians de
clare indications were not expected at
this early date and it would probably
be Wednesday before the Infection
would show Itself at all.
Symptoms of the infection which
state and federal live stock experts
have quarantined in the local stock
yards have been found in two head
of cattle, other than the original sus
pected herd shipped here from Wau
neta, Neb. Dr. James Fleming, local
head of the federal bureau of animal
Industry says the two cattle were
healthy when placed In the suspected
herd several days ago. Tonight vet
erinarians found the same lesions in
the mouth which have affected the
rest of the shipment.
South St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 28.—
Officials of the South 'St. Paul Union
Stock Yard company at South St. Paul
have issued an embargo against live
stock shipments from Illinois points
as a precautionary measure.
It was pointed out that whatever
influence the embargo might have
locally would be on the stocker and
feeder 'trade,. as the restrictions es
tablished at other markets concern
that class of stock largely.

Peking, (Correspondence of The
Associated Press)—Japan's insistence
upon immediate settlement of the de
mands growing out of the Cheng Shla
Tun incident, is creating great un
easiness among Chinese officials.
Chinese nawspapers have been par
ticularly Incensed by Baron Hayashl's
insistence upon granting of police
rights to Japan in parts of southern
Manchuria and eastern inner Mon
golia not already open to trade.
Newspapers which were formerly
Inclined to accept the Japanese state
ment that Baron Hayashi would have
a conciliatory policy, now state that
they were mistaken and Join with the
more radical newspapers in denounc
ing Japan's attitude towards China.
"It is not friendship that Japan
seeks in China," says the Peking Ga
zette. "It is loot and plunder that she
hunts for- It is politically true to re
gard the Japanese attempt to extin
guish Chinese sovereignty in the
regions In question precisely as Korea
was led to the gallows by first con
cluding the convention whereby the
administration of justice and prisons
in the country was delegated to the
Japanese on July 12, 1909. This prac
tical surrender of sovereignty was fol
lowed a year and a month later by the
formal annexation of Korea on Aug.
23, 1910. A child can qse that Barpn

^policing of ftouth Manchuria and
Kastern Inner Mongolia by the Japan

ly yielded—by the formal annexation
of the aforesaid regions before the
end of the war in Europe.
"We must defeat the Japanese by
a campaign of publicity which shall
make known to the world the meaning
of the Japanese objective. It must be
realized as the beginning of the great
est secular danger—not onljj to China
—but to the civilization of the west.
It means the ultimate domination and
control of the men and nameless re
sources of China for ends of barbaric
conquest."

WAR CHARITY
BY BRITAIN
$50,000,000 of This Has
Gone to Allies, Mostly
to Aid Belgians.
London, Nov. 28—Estimates com
pleted for the first two years of the
war show that the enormous sum of
$250,000,000 has been raised in the
British empire for charities growing
out of the world conflict.
Of this amount more than $100,
000,000 has been contributed for the
relief of distress and the re-establish
ment of men returning to civil life.
The Prince of Wales fund is perhaps
the greatest of the public charities
dealing with distress. About $60,000,
000, however, haw been raised in fac
tories, banks, offices and various busi
ness establishments through weekly
contributions for the assistance of
families and dependents of employes
Who have gone to the front. Part of
such funds Is, of course, being reserv
ed for relief work after the war.
For sick and wounded soldiers and
sailors the contributions are estimated
at $30,000,000, most of which has been
raised and administered by the British
Red Cross. Another $30,000,000 has
been spent for soldiers' "comforts,"
such as tobacco, mufflers, pipes, socks,
gloves, sweaters, safety razors, insect
powder, needles, sewing cotton, writ
ing materials, chocolates and sweets.
It is estimated that fully $50,000,
000, contributed in the empire, has
gone for relief work among the Allies,
the largest amount going to Beligum.
Relief among the Belgian refugees in
Great Britain also has called for large
expenditures.

army of General Trevino,
which apparently was trapped into
expending the ammunition of its artil
tery- on Mount Santa Rosa and the
southern defenses of the cltv while
Villa made a pretense of attacking. It
was quite inconceivable to those ac
quainted with the conditions at Chi
huahua that a general of the Bhrewd
ness of Villa would attack the city
from the side of its strongest defenses,
but now his purpose seems to be made
clear.. He had drawn the fire of the
artillery for three days with false at
tacks- and in the meantime had
thrown another force to the north of
the city, cut the railroad and tele
graph lines and then assaulted the
city in force from the weakest ap
proach.
General Trevino has "withdrawn"
from Chihuahua according to the
Carranza authorities of Juarez. But
other sources insist that Trevino was
badly defeated at every point and fled
from his city with such of his forces
as could get away, probably the cav
alry. It is also rumored that Trevino's
infantry deserted to the Villa ranks
and the artillery defenses of the city
are now entirely in the hands of the
bandit leader.
General Gonzales, the Carranza
commander of Juarez, has been order
ed to concentrate at Juarez all the
troops on this section of the border,
fearing that Villa was about to move
on that city which has se.en so many
changes of authority during the past
two years of warfare.
Gonzales Is said to have taken a
small Bcouting force down the rail
road to investigate the situation as
far south as Sauz, about 25 miles
north of Chihuahua, and to learn the
fate of the Trevino garrison. The
wires are still open as far as Sauz,
or were some 12 hours ago when the
last report was received from there.
This report was to the effect that
General Trevino had moved his army
to the south of Chihuahua to join
the force under General Murgia. sup
posed to be marching to the relief of
Chihuahua.
On the train carrying General Gon
zales and his command, which ap
proximated 400 men. was taken a
quantity of ammunition. It is known
that ammunition was stolen from the
train at Callego station, north of Chi
huahua City. Trevino was to have
received ammunition. Carranza offi
cials admit he was short of ammuni
tion.'.
