There is one church service in the
year that every perBon in the city
should attend if at all nossible. This
is the Thanksgiving I nion Service
of the churches of the city and Is
held at a different church each year
with a different pastor to deliver the
sermon. The Idea originated several
years ago and has always proven very
popular.
This year will be.no exception to
the rule. Tho service will be held in
the First M E. Church, South, on West
Second street and the sermon will he
delivered by the Rev. N. F. Jones, pas
tor of the First Baptist Church. His
subject has not been announced as yet
but we feel that It will bring a mes
sage of Thanksgiving and its purposes.
The service will begin at 10 o'clock
promptly and will last about an hour
and a half. The choir of tho church
has prepared several splendid selec
tions for the occasion and the service
will be very Interesting.
All of the people of Maysvllle and
vicinity are urged to attend this meet
ing. It is a good way to show tint'
one is Thankful of the blessings that
he or she has received during the past
year. Certainly every one has some
thing to be Thankful for and wo know
of no better way to show appreciation
of the blessings of God than by wor
shipping in his temple.
