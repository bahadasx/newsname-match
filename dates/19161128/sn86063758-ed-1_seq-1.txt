Saturday night as the clock strikes

A SHOWER AT CENTRAL !
CHURCH PARSONAGE
As an evidence of their apprecia-J
tion of their pastor and their joy over,
his return for another year, the mem- i
bers of Central Methodist church
went in a body to the parsonage on j
Fridnv nieht. laden with tans-ihlp tok
?ns of their esteem.
After the various assortment of
boxes, baskets, bags and bundles had
"been deposited in the dining room and
the turkeys, ducks and chickens had
heen safely stowed in the coops, Mr.'
Z. F. Wright in a clever impres-j
sive way explained the unexpected
visit, calling on Mr. W. H. Wallace,
Mr. J. H. Wicker, Mrs. P. C. Gaillard,
and Mrs. R. D. Wright to say a few
words in behalf of the various organizations
of the church. To all of
these Mr. and Mrs. Dibble responded
In words of deep feeling and appre- j
ciation. Dr. A. J. Bowers, whom this
congregation hoids very dear, had
"been invited to share their- pleasure
and. the impromptu program with an
eloquent tribute to Central's pastor
and a most earnest prayer.
The past year has been one of remarkable
endeavor by the pastor and
congregation of this church, and tlie
dominant idea among them seems *.o;t
be that the coming year will be by j
far thp best in the history of the
church.
It is safe to say that many people
will see "The Hidden Scar" at the
Opera House Tuesday, when it* Is
Known that Ethel Clayton and Holt>rook
Blinn will be featured in It.
Those two bright, particular stars
always draw the crowds.
The leading question now is whether
it will be a married or a single
lady who wins the automobile at the
close of the contest now arawmg to
an .end in The Herald and News. The
closeness of some of the contestants
Is setting to he more and more exciting
as the days slip hy.

Don't spite yourself by being late.

the fact that you did your very best.
It is now or never?do your best or
forever hold your peace.
No Chance to Know.
Don't think for a moment that any
, information will be given anyone as
to how many subscriptions you have

fairly treated in every respect, and no
favoritism will be shown anyone.
' The Herald and News is conducting

hasn't the slightest fo*a, in fact,
he has a very poor memory.

BlUMi LARUE CROWDS
Presbyterian College Will Meet Xew-;

Matched.
i
It will be a case of Greek meeting j
Greek when the Newberry Indians line j
up -against their time-honored rivals, j
tlir- Presbyterian "Blue Stockings'' ::i
their annual gridiron contest on
Thanksgiving afteroon. Both teams
are being primed for this important
game, which resembles, on a smaller
scale, tht> Virginia-Xorth Carolina
> contest in Richmond. Those *vbo at
i tended the game at Clinton last year
: have r.ot forgotten how, in the last
I minute or two of play, Ralpli Baker
I carried the ball across the Prosby
terian goal line for the winning touch'
down. This year again it will be a
i battle to the finish, in which the vic'
tory will not be conceded by cither
; team until tlie time-keepers announce
f the end of the second half. The two
elevens are well matched, in weight
and skill, each having won from WofI
ford and Erskine, and both having
; fallen victims to the -Citadel "Bull
| Dogs." At the helm of the team from
- - t ,1 iL _
Clinton is Johnson, wno coacnea mem
| last year, while "Jimraie' Driver, of
j Virginia, has piloted the local colle;
gians through what has been thus far
| a successful season.
; The officials in charge of the game
! will be Maj. Bowen (Army), referee;
; Mr. McMillan (Clemson.) umpire; Mr.
j Woodhouse (Washington and Lee),
; head linesman.
; The line-up Thursday will include
! such ilustrious names as Renken, the
! big German who has been a tower oi"
! strength at left end this year; Brooks
the powerful center developed by Ray
j Thomas; Aiessinger a star on defense
| in the recent Georgia game; Buster
, Mover, speedy end, and Williams, also
a daring player; .Josephus Nichols an/1
Motscli, as steady men as ever cbarg|
ed an opponents' line; Fisher, the sen!
ior who. in his first year in football
| Las played wonderfully well, and Gaili
lard, a local boy who has made good;
and don't forget Stiles, the tackle
j who uses his hands with such deadly
i el'tVct! The backfield is a power in
i itself, including Dellmin, as brilliant
| and heady a team mentor as South
j Carolina footnaii lias seen mis , i
j Taylor, the wonderful, slippery side- f
stepper a:id broken field runner;
Kennedy, with his mighty punting
toe: Captain Gotschall. the old reliable,
always to be depended on; ai>l
Bachman Nichols, the most terrible
plunging back and greatest ground|
gainer of them all.
In addition to the big game the day
will be marked by the running of the
fiv* mile intercollegiate cross coun
try race. Teams will be entered by
the Presbyterian College, Newberry,
and possibly tlie University of South
Carolina. The finish of this event will
take place on the field before the beginning
of .the football game which
is to be called for 3 o'clock. Last year
Newberry succeeded in winning the
cup, offered by citizens or unnion auu
Newberry, which becomes the permanent
possession of the institution that
wins it three times. The Newberry
team will be composed of Motsch. Davenport,
E. K. Bodie, Cromer, with
Counts as substitute.
Preparations are being made to
make the day-a notable one socially
as well as athletically. Each of the
contesting elevens will be represent- 1
ed by at the game two fair sponsors.
Those chosen for the Newberry team
by ballot of the students are M13S
Louise Haltiwanger and Miss Woodie
Bowman. After the game a banquet
- - j.-rc i.
will be tendered tne aiueiuui atuic^
ic teams and In the evening the-New.
berry Colleg Club will entertain the
visitors of the day and the members
of the college community at a reception
to .be given in Holland Hall.
The big parade before the game will
assemble on the square at 2:45. It
will be headed by one of the Newberry
bands and several hundred col*
