OOL. HOUSE ADVISES
Explanation* and Excuse Have Been

faetory,
[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent]
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.—United
States Ambassador Gerard will carry
a vigorous protest from this govern
ment against the' deportation of Bel
gians Into Germany when he leaver
for his Berlin post, December 5.
An outline on this government's at
titude on the question, which has
stirred all Europe, will be given to
Gerard personally by President Wil
son.
Since Secretary Lansing requested
the American embassy at Berlin to
inquire xsigerdltig, .»*&»• -Belgiap de
portations. several replies have been
received from American officials in
Germany outlining the German de
fense of her action. Obviously, offi
cials admitted today, the decision to
send the protest by Gerard shows
this government Is dissatisfied with
those explanations. Gerard was to
see the president some time this aft
ernoon to get his instructions. These,
as have been previously and exclu
sively stated In United Press dis
patches, will Include a complete out/
line of this government's attitude re
garding the submarine questions, and
a "caution" to the Berlin government
against unbridled revival of her sub
marine campaign as indicated in re
cent sinkings.
Colonel E. M. House, who had
made several visits to belligerent
capitals, is here advising with the
president, Secretary Lansing and
Ambassador Gerard. During his last
visit here, House paid particular at
tention to the systematic develop
ment of American relief work and
fear has been expressed thajt this
work In Belgium will be interrupted
if not entirely discontinued, if the
Teuton allies continue the deporta
tion of Belgians.
It Is understood House feels no
trepidation about recent indications
that Germany may be considering vio
lating her pledges regarding subma
rine warfare. Those who have talked
with him say he feels confident Ger
many Intends to carry out her
promises.
Colonel House said today he had
no plans for going to Europe. A yqar
ago at this time he made a trip and
it has been generally supposed he
would go again when the president
thought the time opportune for sound
ing out belligerent capitals on a pos
sible move for peace.

TELEGRAMS CONFLICT
Bandits Cut In on the Wires to Steal
Messages and Probably
Sent Out Fake
Reports.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
EL PASO. Texas, Nov. 28.—With
out definite news in three days of
the siege and battle for possession of
Chihuahua City, uncertainty among
United States authorities here is
verging toward conviction today that
the captital of the north may havt^
been captured by Villa's bandit army.
Unless General Trevino with his Car
ranzista army Is now fleeing, Villa
still is besieging, the city on all
sides.
Ip United States department circles
these convictions are founded upon
ttdiplseions made b^ Carr^nzfc. offices.
During last night* a message purport
ing to be from Terrazas station,
twenty-five miles north of the state
capital told briefly of the evacuation
of the city. The message was signed
with Trevino's name. While admit
ting that such telegram had come,
Carranza military officers at Juarez
profess to regard it as a forgery.
Since the siege of Chihuahua City
began. Villa telegraph operators have
cut in on the telegraph lines, catch
ing messages. Several times they
have cut in with taunts of cowardice.
Later in the night another message
oame declaring Villa had captured
the city and that General Trevino
was hurrying south.
United States department officials
confess they are puzzled by the mys
terious wires.
Statements by Mexican defacto
officers early today that they haa a
communication from General Trevino
by way of Odjiaga yesterday, but that
the "situation was unchanged," are
taken as the strongest indication that
the Villista forces are surrounding
the capital closely.
Reinforcements Sent.
.EL PASO, Texas, Noy 28.—With
about four hundred men, drawn from
the garrisons of Casas Grandes and
Namiquipa, General Gonzales, Mexi
can defacto commander at Juarez,
started toward Chihuahua City .before
dawn today on military trains.
Officers of the garrison remaining
at Juarez declared that Gonzales is
rushing these reinforcements to the
aid of General Trevino, admitting
that the besieged garrison In the cap
ital of the north is being hard press
ed on all sides by Villa's bandit army.
Andres Garcia, Merican consul gen
eral, today refused to comment upon
reports that General Trevino bad
been driven out of Chihuahua City.
""We have no news," is all the Mexi
can defacto official would venture.
Think City Is Taken.
EL PASO, Trtxas, Nov. 28.—Pancho
Villa is in possession of Chihuahua
City and General Trevino with his
Carranzista garrison has evacuated
and fled southward In an attempt to
form a junction with General Mur
gia's relief column of defacto troops,
according to reports obtained today
by United Sta:es authorities here and
transmitted to Washington.
Mexican defacto officials at the con
sulate here refine to make any state
ment except to say that they have no
information and confirmation of the
capture of the city is unavailable up
to the present time. According to
statements, a message early today
signed by Trevino and carried by
courier to a point where the telegraph
line is open to Juarez, stated that
Trevino had ?eft to meet Murgla.
Following a Junction with Murgia,
the message rtated Trevino will re
turn and attempt to drive Villa out
of Chihuahua City. The wire was
received by a relative of Trevino,
United States officials say. High U.
S. authorities declare they believe
the report. Before Gonzales' troop
trains pulled out of Juarez early to
day, scores of cases of cartridges
were loaded upon the cars.
In spite of apparently authentic
basis for the report that Villa has
taken Chihuahua City, there is still
an air of uncertainty among some
United States department officials.

Ask Food Regulation.
[By George Martin, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
NEW YORK, Nov.
28.—Formal
ap
peal for government regulation of the
country's food supply was forwarded
to President Wilson today by the
representatives cf two million woffin
of the National Housewives' league.
Simultaneously Patrick E. Qutnn.
government commissioner for New
South Wales, explained the Auitra
lian system of food control to the
United Press and recommended its
adoption by the united States.
The plea of the housewives and the
remedial system outlined by Quinn
dovetail with Governor Whitman's
move for the regulation of New
York's food supply by a state food
commission. Both Quinn and Mrs.
Julian Heath, prtt ident of the House
wives' league praised Governor Whit
man's action.
The housewives' resolution adopted
by the state chaiimen of the league
from every state in the union, bases
its appeal on the assertion that "the
people of the United States are suf
fering from exorbitant prices due to
shortage of crops, increased exporte,
decreased imports and speculation."
The league appeal urges the gov
ernment to "determine by all pos
sible methods the food supply needed
to feed the people of the Unit
States and to take measures to li*ait
sale* for export to tho surplus over
domestic requirements."
At the same time an egg boycott
was spreading rapidly and promised
to become country-wide.
"With speculators holding a gun to
tho heads of the American peopie,
your situation stems to demand dras
tic measures," said Quinn, telling
why he thought the United States
should establish government control
of food prices.
"The storing of eggs, butter, meat,
poultry and like foodstuffs to boost
prices is only lesr criminal than the
destruction of food to keep the mar
ket up, such as I have seen in San
Francisco.

[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
LONDON, Nov. 28.—Orderly retreat
of the Rjunianian army still continues
—and this.was the only satisfactory
part of the Rumanian situation in
the minds of military experts today.
No attempt was made to minimize
the effectiveness of the German drive,
engineered by the weight of superior
forces and directed toy the eyes of
plenty of aviators—against troops
lacking in both of these arms.
Abandonment of the Alt river line,,

from Bulgaria and apparently affect

eral Von Falkenhayn somewhere be

ments claimed envelopment of largo
forces of R.ufnanians In the extreme
southwestern tip of Wallachla, but It
is hoped here that the major portion
of the defenders escaped before, the*
circle of steel was fully forged around
them.
It is expected here that the Euman
ian army will fall back to the line o£
the river Argeshu, consolidating their
forces and preparing to make a stand
here.
In the meanwhile London awaited
confirmation of Copenhagen dis
patches yesterday that Czar Nicholas
of Russia was enroute to the Ruman
ian frontier to confer wit* King
Ferdinand of Rumania—presumably
over Russian reinforcements.
