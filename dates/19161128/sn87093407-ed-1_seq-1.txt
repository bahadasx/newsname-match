"hero"
H. L. Brann&n, motorman for the traction
company, went to his death without a waver
to save the lives of his passengers—the Trac
tion company's passengers.
Brannan died a hero. He died a death
that should be an inspiration to every one of
his thousand or more fellow employes.
He went to his death to save other lives
—lives FOR WHICH HIS EMPLOYER,
THE TRACTION COMPANY, WAS RE
SPONSIBLE.
The whole city felt a pride in Brannan's
heroism. Every motorman and every con
ductor felt proud to have been his comade.
The Traction company, above allothers,shou!d
have felt both proud and grateful to H. L.
Brannan.
But—
Before Brannan's body, crushed and
bleeding,reaches the grave, the Traction com
pany starts its investigation TO VINDICATE
A BRAKE AND TO BLAME THE MAN.
Today the company announces its hurried
verdict. IT FINDS BRANNAN GUILTY.

PEANUT POLITICIANS
NEED NOT READ THIS
If you are a peanut politician, this will not
interest you.
If you are one who votes for any yellow
dog because he belongs to your PARTY, you can
stop right here. You will save time.
This is meant entirely for free, independent
citizens, who own their own souls and who vote
conscientiously for the best men in ANY party.
There's a fine chance to remove all the bunk about
grand old parties of every kind by the adoption of
Nonpartisan Bill No. 28. The recent election showed
clearly that a great majority of the people are truly
nonpartisan.
If 100,000 signatures can be obtain, the legisla
ture, however bourbon it may be, may be induced to
pass it immediately. At any rate, if it fails to do so,
it will be compelled, under the law, to submit it
to the people for a direct vote.
Now, here is where you can help. Saturday has
been designated as Nonpartisan day. Take a few
hours off Saturday and circulate a petition for signa
tures eitfier downtown or in the residence districts.
Your friends and acquaintances will, in most
ca';es, thank you for the chance to sign the non
patrisanship bill. They, like you, want a free oppor
tunity to vote for men without being pestered with
needless party labels.
Volunteers are asked to call at Nonpartisan
headquarters, 3107 Arcade building. The telephone
is Elliott 4255.

LONDON, Nov. 28.—Eight thousand feet
aloft, above the North sea, British hydro
planes sent a German Zeppelin hurtling
down to destruction in flames today. A

aflame, into the water.

repelling the 27th air raid made by the Ger

the dangerous business of attack
