HERE'S ONE TACOMA
COUPLE ACTUALLY
CUTTING H.C. OF L.
By Mabel Abbott
"Most of the people who make
so much fuss about the high cost
of living are the ones who live out
of paper bags!"
Thus does a Tacoma man who
has actually lowered the cost of
living for himself and his family
sum up the situation as he sees it.
And his wife'B idea Is the same,
differently expressed.
"The trouble is

Mr. and Mrs. L. W. Hobson, 814
South 66th, have won the right to
speak on this subject. For this is
what they have done:
"When we were first married,"
said Mrs. Hobson yesterday, "our
grocery bills were $3t) or $*XX\ a

In the family, and our grocery bill
Is $13 or $14."
"And wo live well," put in Mr.
Hobson. "Don't forget that."
The Hobsons' pretty little home
Is two blocks from the end of the
Bismarck car line.

MAY ADD
TO JONES
BUILDING
Plans are being considered
Tuesday for the construction of
one or possibly two stories addi
tional to those already planned
for the new $400,000 Jones
building which Is to house the
Pantages theater at 9th and
Broadway.
While the architect and build
ers are considering the feasibility
of the addition, construction work
has been halted temporarily.
The change will mean putting
in heavier pillars and beams and
altering the detailed plans
throughout the building.
The addition, if carried out,
will mean that the number of of
fice rooms will be nearly doubled.
The additional cost has not been
definitely figured.
Tho plans at present provide
for six stories facing Broadway.
The two additional stories would
be on the Broadway side and
would extend only part of the
length of the building.

Just give the voters a chance
to sign the initiative measure for

From the number of signatures
already obtained, and the eager

the petitions placed before them
and pens are placed In their
hands, it is as clear as day that
public sentiment Is overwhelm

The only thing la to get the pe

Sunday's Sermon
Not at All Like
Most, Says West
By E. A. Peters
How does a minister like the
Idea of having his church services
"written un" by one of those un
sentimental reporter fellows who
simply write what thi\v see and
hear —when they are allowed to?
That was my first wonder when
I read the review by my fellow
worker, Edgar C. Wheeler, of
church services at the First Bap
tist Sunday morning.
So 1 called upon Hey. James S.
West, with the offer that I would
write for hint any statement or re
ply that he should offer on
Wheeler's "review," just so his
side of the story should receive
equal emphasis.
Hey. West was not angry be
cause the reporter had not paint
ed a rosy picture of the Sunday
services.
He was sorry that Ihe article
had been printed, he said, and he
was sure that Mr. Wheeler would
not have done such a thing, had
he realized the circumstances.
Was S|i. .ml Meeting.
You see, the church has been
conducting special services, and
Wheeler walked Into the crucial
meettag without knowing it. It
was unfortunate for the church
and unfair on the part of the re
porter that Whesler should have
selected that particular morning
for attending the service. So, the
pastor assured me.
"The reported could not have
selected a more inauspicious oc
casion for coming to my church
for the purpose of writing such an
article.
"Not once in 10 years do 1 de
liver such a sermon as I did on
Sunday morning. But the sermon
was appropriate under ihe circum
stances.
"It happens that we have been
conducting a series of evangelistic
services at the church. The
church workers have been "under
a high tension. Sunday's service
wan the closing one of the series,
and tension among everyone was
at its highest pitch. My sermon
was delivered as the climax of a
nmost Interesting and Interest-cor-
pelling campaign.
Usually in Lighter Vein.
"As 1 say, a person could at
tend my church for 10 years and
never hear me deliver such a ser
mon, if there has ever been any
criticism of my sermons, here or
anywhere else, It has been that
they have inclined toward the

lighter topics and have been al
most too unconventional.
"As a usual rule, I create
laughter during my sermons three
times as frequently as the average
minister. Particularly is this
true at tbe evening services.
"1 tell little witty stories to
illustrate my topics, and try to I
make my sermons modern and in
teresting rather than heavy and
cumbersome. Ido not try to ai»
peal to the emotions.
Home Members Object.
"Some members of .ny congre
gation have predicted that I would
have a most awful judgment
awaiting me, because cf the ap
parent lightness of my topics and
my sermons.
"1 have advertised my sermons
in the public press, and that has
also aroused criticism.
"I preach the doctrines of Jesus
Christ, but I try to do It In a
modern, Interesting way. No mat
ter how light or humorous :ny
sermon may be at the start, I al
ways use the jokes and modern
argument as a means of arriving
at some smashing climax, and I
believe that it has a greater ef
fect this way than If 1 should de
vote the entire service to a dry
discussion of deeply religious
topics.
"Some of my congregation won
der how I am able to deliver a
light sermon like this at one serv
ice and a heavy one at the fol
lowing service. Ido It simply
because I realize that the modern
person likes variety.
I'sher I nun iful.
"On Thanksgiving morning I
am to preach the sermon at First
Presbyterian church for a joint
service of the five large churches.
At such a service, where my style
of sermon is unfamiliar, 1 would
not dare to deliver my usual hap
py, witty type of address.
"It was indeed unfortunate that
one of the church workers asked
your reporter if he were a Chris
tian. I can only say that the per
son who did this was enthusiastic
because of the high tension of the
service, and acted in a manner
which he should not have done
had he thought carefully. It Is
unfair to criticise the pastor or
the church because of the act of
one zealous worker.
"All that I can say Is that the
audience waa gripped by the series
of services, and that the church
did not, for that reason have Its
customary atmosphere."
and damnation stuff Is a relic of
the dark ages, and too many
preachers seem to know how to
play the part only of Gloomy Gus.

One of the happiest quar

the period 1 devote to the
perusal of the Yacolt News.
I always do this after the
whirl of the day when the
paper goes to press. It is so
restful to lounge back in my
office chair and imbibe sec
ond-hand a little of the easy
flowing life of Yacolt.
Today I note, for example,

The first Zeppelin, which ap

was pursued by an aeroplane as
It turned homeward. Not until
the Zeppelin was over the sea off
the Durham coast did the British
aviator succeed in reaching a vital

Then he brought the great
dreadnaught of the air down, a
burst of flame.

places," Gen. French's statement

Then she turned homeward and
sought to escape, with British
aeroplanes pursuing and anti

was apparently struck.

The last part of her journey

She was unable to reach the
