TEMPORARY PLAN
TO TREAT SEWAGE
Council Adopts Lynch's Rcc
ommcndation to Shut
Down Plants
EXPENSE IS PLEADED
Riverside Ordinance In; Confer
on Park Exonerations;
Lighting Bill
Harrisburg to-day officially declin
ed to comply any longer with the State
Health Department's order directing
the municipality to temporarily disin
fect its sewage in the interceptors to
protect towns down stream against
possible typhoid infection.
In accordance with a recommenda
tion by City Commissioner "YV. H.
Lynch, superintendent of Public Im
provements, seconded by City Com
missioner H. F. Bowman, superinten
dent of Public Safety, Council unani
mously agreed to discontinue the tem
porary disposal plants on the river
front and Paxton creek interceptors.
Heavy expense combined with the
belief that the typhoid outbreak is
thoroughly under control, that the
sewage is properly treated in the
t homes of sufferers under instruction of
the city health department, and that
the river is open to pollution from
drainage of towns upstream'were the
reasons advanced by Mr. Lynch for
asking Council's support in refusing
to comply with State Health Commis
sioner Dixon's decree.
Heavy Expense
Mr. Lynch explained that the tem
porary plants have cost $2,108.92 in
little more than a month's operation.
Council had only appropriated $3,000.
Following a brief conference with
Spencer C. Gilbert, Samuel C. Todd of
the Capitol Park Extension Commis
sion, and Charles E. Etter, the com
mission's realty expert, Council to-day
turned over the question of tax ex
onerations in the park extension to
the city solicitor's department, Mr.
Etter and City Assessor James C.
Thompson to report upon. It was
announced that the State will proba
bly not expect to take over the lire

MY KINGDOM FOR A TURKEY
Harrisburg, Pa., Nov. 23, 'l6.
To the Editor of the Telegraph:
I have a new 1917 model auto
mobile that I would like to exchange
for a turkey. Is there anybody you
can suggest who might be induced to
make the trade?
I do not expect a large turkey—just
a moderate sized one. Anxiously
awaiting your reply, because we ex

Yours truly,
PIANO MAN.
P. S.—My machine Is a 1917 model
Peerless.
Now, Mr. Piano Man, here are two
letters from farmers of Dauphin and
Cumberland counties, calling your
"bluff." One of the farmers prefers
a Ford, so if you can exchange your
car for a flivver, you may be able to
come to terms.
The other farmer from Cumberland
county won't take a Ford and makes
a few extra demands which you may
care to Investigate.
The two letters follow:
Rush Township,
A man said to me that he saw
in your paper where a man want
ed to swop a Peerless atermobile
for a turkey. I have a flock of
3 turkey and will swop 1 or two.
I wont to keep one for Krismas

swop on a Ford. My girl has a

Local banks report a scarcity of
one, two and five dollar bills. There
Is also a shortage of pennies, and it is
said that new coin, in demand for
Christmas, is likely to be scarce this

part of the government to '.neet the
demand.

Cumberland Man's Offer
Newburg, Pa.,
Nov. 27, 1916.
To tho Harrisburg Telegraph:
In a recent issue of your paper
a Piano Man requests you to in
veigle someone Into trading a tur
key for his automobile. I felt in
different about it until he pleaded
the prospect of company. As my
own neutrality has been violated
frequently in the same manner,
my sympathy wad thoroughly
aroused.
I am the hoped-for someone. I
have a small gobbler with beard,
wishbone and klaxon In good con
dition which I will exchange for
a seven - passenger auto, 1917
model, provided the same Is
equipped with an extra Bet of
tires, carries a contract for free
repairing for a year, and Is ship
ped, charges prepaid, to my sum
mer home in Alaska.
This is a most generous offer,
considering the expense incident
to supporting a first-class harem.
One of every seventeen of my tur
keys died uninsured last summer
and their obsequies damaged the
sinking fund like shrapnel. Then,
too, the surviving birds dine on
the European plan, ' and the
cuisine must be a medley of
bugs, grasshoppers, and perhaps,
corn. My luck may not endure
throughout another year, and I
believe In preparedness.
P. B.—As this is strictly' a
charitable proposition, the offer
is not open to owners of Fords.
Cordially yours,
CUM 13. CO. FARMER.

States just before Thanksgiving ind
the supply this year is even larger
than in the past. Shippers yesterday
asked 28 to 29 cents per pound for
