THE RUSH INTO KANSAS
The last day of the seventeenth an
nual Missouri Conference for Social
Welfare opened this morning with rep
resentatives from nine state institu
tions. Including hospitals No. 1, No. 3
and No 4, the school., tor the blind and
ceaf in ot. Louis and niton, the In
dustrie School for uirls at Chillt
cotne, the School for the Feeble-Mind-
ed at Marshall, the State Sanitarium
for Tuberculosis at Mount Vernon and
the Confederate Home at Hlgginsville.
Numerous county boards and city in
stitutions have their representatives
in the auditorium. Montgomery Coun
ty sent three members of its board.
''John S. Day of St Louis, chairman
of the committee on negroes, failed to
appear this morning, but sent his re
port on the problems of the negroes to
be read by J. L. Wagner. This is the
second upset in the official program,
- the first being the failure of Frederick
D. Gardner, governor-elect, to appear
yesterday afternoon.
First Rural Problems Report.
The need of economic and social re
forms in rural life was the topic ot
discussion by Prof. L. L.. Bernard, of
the University and Prof. E. W. Suth
erland of William Jewell College at
this morning session of the confer
ence in the University Auditorium.
Professor Bernard, as chairman, gave
the report of the committee on rural
problems. He said that this was prob
ably the first report of its kind made
in the state.
Professor Bernard gave satisfies
showing the percentage of tenant far
mers in the United States and in Mis
souri. He said that a co-operative
system was needed bythe farmers in
economic and social matters. "Better'
educational facilities are needed," he
said, "and all doggerel and nonsense
should be taken out of tbe rural
schools' curricula. A system of com
munity organization should be adopt
ed and should include playgrounds
and facilities for recreation."
Professor Bernard concluded his ad
dress by saying that to remedy the
conditions in rural life a social sur
vey should be made possible by state
appropriations; that extension work
ers should be as active in this phase
of farm life as those whose work dulls
with instructing the farmer in better
crop methods, and finally, that these
reform measures should come through
the rural school as it should be, not
as it is now.
x "The farmer has not produced the
many rural improvements of the last
twenty-fhe years," said Professor
Sutherland in his address on the far
mer's attitude toward rural life.
"That, in part, explains his indiffer
ence toward any further reforms."
Professor Sutherland said that the
farmer, because of his independence
and his isolated position, was the last
person to recognize his needs and that
he took the least interest in govern
mental affairs other than national
politics.
Merchants More Active Than Farmers.
"In Clay County, when the bond is
sue for rock roads was passed, the
farmers were either very apathetic
about, or directly opposed to, the is
sue." said Professor Sutherland. "The
merchants and bankers' associations
took an active interest in the elec
tion, howeer.'
The speaker said this was the case
in nearly all reform movements which
tended to help the fanner, that the
government, the railroads and the
business men of the country usually
were the cause of such progressive
measures. Professor Sutherland con
cluded by saying that this apathy was
fast disappearing among the farmers
and that they were taking a greater
interest in their own affairs, as shown
by the numerous organizations for
mutual aid among the farmers of this
age. "All such voluntary associations
should be encouraged," he said, "as
they will mean better rural conditions,
socially, economically and -politically."
14 Cities Have Welfare Societies.
L. A. Halbert, chairman of the com
mittee on relief and superintendent of
the Board of Public Welfare of Kan
sas City, read a report at the confer
ence this morning. There are, he re
ported, fourteen provident and public
welfare associations in Misourl main
tained in St. Louis, Kansas City, St.
Joseph, Joplin, Springfield, Columbia,
Hannibal, Cape Girardeau, Moberly,
Farmington, Poplar Bluff, Klrkwood,
Marshall and Sedalia.
Besides these general organizations
there are special Jewish societies, in
St Louts, Kansas City and St Joseph.
There is also a great deal ot relief
work done by the cities and the coun
ties and in the larger cities Catholic
organizations have done effective
work.
K. C. Wife Deserters Brought Back.
In connection with Mr. Halbert's re
port. Miss Eva M. Marquis read a re
port of the investigation of divorces,
desertions, and orphans in Kansas
City. It was found that 32 per cent
of the children in orphans' homes had
one parent, or both, living.
That the segregated vice district is
not, in a strict sense, a segregated
district and has never been a success;
that medical inspection has nothing to
support it as a preventive measure;
that-little can be done through legis
lation; that sterilization has little
significance as prevention of com
mercialized vice, but that a practical
program carrying out a steady policy
of ice repression was shown marked
success these points were the sub
stance of the lecture by Dr. William
F. Snow, in the University Auditorium
last night.
Doctor Snow, general secretary of
the American Social Hygiene Associa
tion, gave as his subject "Repression
of Commercialized Prostitution." A
great deal of emphasis throughout the
talk was given to the contention that
segregation is merely a surrender and
will not begin to solve the problem.
"The vice district is a residence
district," Doctor Snow said. "I have
always found this to be true, both in
Europe and America. It is the resi
dence district of the poor and of the
immigrant class, who go into such
sections without knowing what kind
of place they are getting into.
"Vice Should Be Kept From Poor."
"If we suppress the vice in these
districts, people claim that we will
drive the disease carriers into the real
residence district, which is no more
a residence section than the other, but
merely of a different class. This mov
ing of the vice Interests out into the
better parts of the city is always a
temporary arrangement They go
back after the interest dies down, or,
if repression is continued, they move
to another state or another communi
ty. If we have to have commercialized
vice, it is better to have it in the sec
tions of the rich than in the districts
inhabited by the poor; for the rich
can find means of getting rid of such
institutions, while the poor are help
less."
Doctor Snow used lantern slides to
illustrate his lecture. He dealt with
the venereal diseases just as other
preventable diseases would be taken
up. "No diseases outrank these in
importance to society," he said.
The speaker's idea was that so
ciety should begin with the child in
working against these diseases. Since
the soluUon finally depends upon self-
control, he emphasized the work that
the father and mother, teacher, minis
ter and physician could do in teach
ing personal hygiene. He held that
companionship and wholesome recrea
tion were big factors in prevenUng
vice. That we ought to understand
something of mating was his opinion.
"Much of what has been said ot eu
genics has been bad," he said, "but
much of it has been good."
"Admitting that feeble-mindedness
constitutes a condition which is dan-

There have been many inquiries at
Director C. L. Brewer's office in the
last few days concerning the special

for one of the specials. The special
train that was supposed to leave Co
lumbia at 11:30 o'clock Wednesday
night has been changed to 12:45
o'clock Wednesday afternoon. The
change was necessary on account of
the large number that would go on
the 4:15 o'clock special.
The excursion rates are good only
on the special trains leaving Columbia

4:15 the same afternoon. There will
