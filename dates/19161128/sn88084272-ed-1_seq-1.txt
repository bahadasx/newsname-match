SO miles northwest of the capital.
The capture of Giurgiu places

Gen. von Falkenhayn's troops ap

More Air Raids
The latest German air raids over
England cost the raiders the loss
of two zeppelius, according to
London's official report today.
Both machines were brought down
in flames by airplanes, assisted In
one case by an armed trawler.
British to Make New Attack
Considerable interest attaches
to the reports of artillery activity
that continue to come from the
Tpres, Arras and Armentieres dis
trict, toward the northern end of
the Franco-Belgian front. The
Tpres sector, in particular, has
been twice mentioned within the
last 4 hours In the British reports,
Monday night as the scene of a
British bombardment, while today
heavy German shelling of the line
north of Yores is recorded. Recent
reports from Berlin declared that
indications were accumulating that
an attack by the entente at some
point along the German lines on
the western front was in contem

Precedents and Law Exam
ined Before Any Formal
Protest WfflBe Made.
"Washington, D. C, Nov. 2S. The
state department Is carefully examin
ing international law and all possible
precedents before making representa
tions to Great Britain as a result of
Britain's refusal to Issue safe conducts
to the new Austro-Hungarian ambas
sador, count Tarnowski, and his secre
taries. The unfavorable action of the
British government has come "as a sur
prise. ,
It was learned today that the state
department so far has not made a for
mal request for a safe conduct for the
Austrian ambassador but has confined
Itself to a transmission of the request
of the Austrian government for such
a courtesy. Therefore it is probable
that if the issue is to be made up it
will be necessary for the United States
now to make such request on its own
account.
There is an absence of any precedent
exactly fitting this case that requires
the department to be very careful in
assuming ground and the text of the
note handed ambassador Page will be
awaited before a decision as to the
course to be followed is reached. Grp.it
Britain's attitude, if alhered to, would
prevent a new Turkish ambassador and

Negotiations reeardlntr a new Turkish

Government Organizes Five
Base and Eight Camp
Hospitals on Border."
San Antonio. Tex, Nov. 28. Within
the last fire months the most Complete
medical organization known to the
United States anry has been devel
oped to care for the 150.060 state and
regular troops stationed at bo der
points and in Mexico.
The system includes five base hospi
tals, located at strategic points in the
long stretch of border territory; eight
camp hospitals at other points where
troops are stationed, a cantonment
hospital at Columbus. N. M-, to serve
the force on duty in Mexico, and 26
ambulance companies and 41 field hos
pitals distributed among troops id the
field.
The base and camp hospitals afford
accommodation for a total of 4,600 pa
tients and have medical and surgical
faciliities equal to the finest hospitals.
Not more than half the beds have been
occupied at any one time since the na
tion's militia strength was called into
the federal service, but the room is
available in case of need.
Hospital Train Provided.
Back of this army is the potential
organization. A hospital train of ten
Pullman cars, with a capacity of 250
patients, has been placed in use to
transport patients from the camp to
the base hospitals and from base hos
pitals to general military hospitals In
various parts of the country, should
a campaign In Mexico be undertaken.
These larger institutions are the Wal
ter Reed hospital at Washington, D.
C, the general Army and Navy hospi
tal at Hot Springs. Axle and the Let

- Last July when state troops began
arriving at the border the only army
establishments for the care of sick
were tho post hospitals at Fort Sam

smaller places at Laredo and a few
other border points. Practically the
entire system of base and camp hos
pitals has been built since the call on
the national guard was made.
As a result of. he scientific methods
adopted by the medical corps and the
steps taken to Insure absolute sanita
tion in border camps, the big command
of regulars and militia has set a pew
health record. From May 1 to Octo
