NOT TOJE VOTED ON
Supreme Court Holds Petition
Was Filed OnelJay
Too Late
Because Attorney Richardson was
one day late in filing the inia
tive measure for bonding the
city of Salem for tthe paving of the
streets and as a result there was outy
29 davs instead o thirty following its
filing, the writ of mandamus asked by
Josie L. Stewart to compel Bert Macy,
city attorney, and Charles F. Elgin,
city recorder to place the title of the
initiative measure on the ballot for the
general city election December, 1910,
was denied this morning by the Oregon
supreme court, and the demurrer inter
posed by the defendant city was sua
tnined. S. T. Richardson appeared for the
petitioner and ltert Muey for the de
fendant city. The petition states that
the initiative measure wns signed by
the requisite number of qualified vot
ers and was in proper form and was
Tiled with the city recorder "on or be
tween November 2 and November 4, aud
that th next general election occurs
on December 4."
Justice lienii in rendering the opin
ion, says tho city officers demurred to
the alternative writ for the reason thai
it, does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. It is point
ed out that the former city ordinnucc
required sixty days filing " before the
election. The contention of trie city :s
that the petition was not filed witri
the recorder within th time required
by law. It was insisted that, the ordi
nance amending and reducing the time
for filing did not go into effect until
ten davs after approval by the mayor
or November 0, and therefore there was
no time for compliance with the terms
before the election kff December 4.
The contrary was maintained by the
counsel for the plaintiff.
"Assuming without deciding that tac
ordinance approved October 25 is tn
force and the date of the election De
cember 4." said Justice Bean, "by the
terms of the latter ordinance an initi
ative petition must be filed not later
than thirty days before that dute. The
last day would bV November 3. After
the filing thirty days must elapse."
. The petition was filed November !,
which, excluding that day as required
by law, leaves only 2St days to elapse
before the election.
The court held that it was not neces
sary, therefore to consider the question
whether the ordinance is in force as
in any eTFnt - the initiative petition
was not filed according to the allega
tions. The demnrrer-of the city was

Growers and Dealers Allowed

Than That
MANY PRODUCTS SOLD
FOR HALF OF COST HERE
Government Sets Prices of
Staples Every Monday and
Those Prices "Go"
By George Martin.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
New York, Nov. 28. Formal appeal
for government regulation of tho coun
try's food supply was forwarded to
President Wilson today by the represen
tatives of two million women of the Na
tional Housewives' league.
Simultaneously Patrick E. Quinn,
government commisisoner for New
South Wales, explained the Australian
system of food control to the United
Press aud recommended its adoption by
the United States. The plea of the
housewives and the remedial system out
lined by Quinn dovetail with Governor
Whitman's move for the regulation of
New' York's food supply by a state
food commission. Both Quinn and Mrs.
Julian Heath, president of the House
wives', league, jmus-ed Governor Whit
man 's action.
Tho housewives' rebellion, adopted by
the state chairman of the league from
every state in the union, bases its ap
peal on the assertion tbt "the people
of the. United States are suffering from
exorbitant prices due to shortuge of
crops, increased exports, decreased iin
ports and speculation."
The league's appeal urges tho gov
ernment "to determine by all possible
methods the food simply needed to feed
the people of tho United States and to
take measures to limit sales tor export
to the surplus over domestic require
ments.
Egg Boycott Spreads.
At the same time an egg boycott was
spreading rapidly and promised to be
come country-wide.
"With speculators holding a gun to
the heads of the American people, your
situation seems to demnnd drastic meas
ures," said Quinn, telling why he
thought the United States should es
tablish ' government control of food
prices.
"The storing of eggs, Quitter, meat
poultry and like foodstuffs to boost
prices is only less criminal than the de
struction ot food to keen tne market up
such as I have -seen in San Francisco.
"I don't want to appear nosey about
the affairs of n country whose guest I
am, but when I see high prices in the
I nited States where there is no regula
tion, and compare it with the reasonable
prices and legitimate profit obtaining
m my homo country of New South
Wales, where food prices are controlled
by the government, it is a strong temp
tntion to say 'go thou nnd do like
wise. '
."Everv Monday morning the pre
vailing prices fjjr staples are announced
by the government. If the announced
price is SO cents for butter, the house
wife knhws she ill pay 30 cents and no
more without ample warning. In the
United Stntes the housewife reads a quo
tation of 41 cents for butter and prays
all the way down town next morning
that it won't have jumped a nickel a
pound over night.
Consumers Are Robbed.
1 "Thanks to our control system, house
wives in Sydney and other large cities
pay about 2o cents a dozen for the best
egg. - Can you imagino that for fresh
eggs here I No, hut there is no legiti
mate reason why it shouldn't be.
"Your American egg barons would
like to hit me with some of their stor
age goods for saying it, 110 doubt, but
the reason eggs are not 25 cents here is
that the speculators are holding a pistol
to the consumers' head.
"At home we provide a reasonable
profit for the producer, one for the
wholesaler, and one for the retailer, and
yet sell many articles of food at half
and less than half what you pay here.
"The solution of your storage specu
lation problem seems to me simple.
Legislation prohibiting the sale of cold
storage products altogether is the solu
tion. ,ome Forcible Comparisons.
"There is plenty of food of all kinds
in the United States. The speculators
have got dealers-nnd consumers by the
throat. They have raised the false cry
of 'heavy exports on account of the
war,' and then have boosted prices on
that articficial theory. This is.a situa
tion that could not exist iu New South
Wales. "
"In Australia we believe that o gev
ernment which cannot control prices for
the benefit of the people is not living
up to its obligations as a democracy.
"Can you imagine a two pound loaf
of bread selling iu the United States
for seven eeutsf I think not. Yet,

GERMANY IS

Prices Are Quoted Showing
Increases and Difficulty
In Securing Eatables
Tho following letter from Germany
received by a relative of the writer,
speaks for itself, says the Portland Ev
ening Telegram:
The past two years I have written
you many letters and sent yon many
packnges of newspner8, but have re
ceived no answer. I hope from dnv to
day and week to week but do not near
from you.
My dear children, during this war
we are having an awful time, such ns
we have never before experienced.
In my old age I must live in wan?
and in sororw.
You will be surprised to know wha?
everything costs here. A pound or
bad potato bread that is hardly lit to
eat, costs 17 pfennigs (4jc). We can
only have three or four pounds per
woek nnd this only 'with governmeni
tickets, and unless you have a ticke,
you cannot buy anything, even if yon
havo money.
E's wife hns bought two six pound
.oaves of unstamped bread several
times a week at 3 marks 80 (93c) a
piece and it is very poor bread at that.
Some two pound loaves sell for 1 marc
30 (3ac). We can't eat much bread
and a piece of butter costs 1 mark and
SO pfonnigo (4.1c). Wo can only buy
a quarter of a pound of butter a week
a person, even if we offer to pay
thaler (75c )for a piece, we cannot got
it.
We can only buy one "quarter of a
pound of meat a week and beef costs
2 marks 40 'to 2 marks 00 (00 to 60c)
per pound and pork costs 3 marks 00
'Mc' and veal tho same.
Now you can see how everyone must
loso weight with such food nnd how
peoplo are suifering from hunger here.
A pound of vile tobacco, that in fact
is not tobacco at all, costs 2 marks
30 (63c) a pound. I.Biuoke dried black
berry leaves and you can imagine wha:

El Taso, Texas, Nov. 28. rancho
Villa is iu possession of Chihuahua City
and General Thcvino with his Carranzis
ta garrison has evacuated and fled
southward in an attempt to form a
junction witn General Mnrgla's relief
column of de facto troops, according to
reports obtained today by United States
authorities Here and transmitted to
Washington.
Mexican de facto officials at the con
sulate here refuse to make any state
ment except to say that they have no
information and complete confirmation
of the capture of the city is unavail
able up tq the present time
According to United States depart
ment ngeuts, a message early today
signed by Trevino and carried by cour
ier to Tcrrazns to which point tho tele
graph line was open from Juarez stated
that Trevino had left tho capital to
meet Murgin.
Following a junction with Murgin, the
message stated, Trevino .will return and
attempt to drive Villa out of Chihua
hua City. The wire was received by a
relative of Trevino, Uifited States of
ficial said. '
High United Stntes authorities de
clare they beliove the report.
Before Gonzales troop .trains pulled
out of Juarez early today, scores of
cases of cartridges were loaded upon
the cars.
May Change All Plana.
Officials prefer to wait the ontcome
of the fighting in the vicinity o'f the
state capital before going on with mili
tia plans. They admitted frankly that
if Villa possesses Chihuahua City os re
ported, "real trouble will be popping"
throughout northern Mexico and particu
uarly at Juarez, across from El Paso,
within another week. In such circum
stances, authorities do not wish to weak
en the border patrol.
If the outcome - of the. Chihuahua
fighting, however, completely elimin
ates Villa, the war department will pro
ceed with withdrawal of General Persh
ing's column at the close of 40 days and
wifli the complete relief of the militia
forces.
The decision temporarily to halt mili

Among tho new buildings we believe

this would be a good educational in

one of the buildings is used for the
purpose of stacking up several thous

Another new building needed is on
administration or office building, We
were surprised when we entered tne
dingy suite of rooms in u very old Viuitit
ing where the business of the school is
transacted. It is an old wooden build
ing, the floors are rough and uneven.
The structure was evidently built for
some other purpose. There is no fire
proof vault in the building. We believe
a suitable fire proof building eouid be
constructed for $7,300.00
We believe a nc.. building is also
needed for vocational anil industrial
training for girls. The presert one Is
very inadequate, being built of wnoir,
and entirely too small to accommodate
the large classes. Apparently it was
never designed for its present use. We

Completion of Alaska
Railroad Delayed
. Seward, Alaska, Nov. 28. Delays in
construction .will prevent the comple

Seward and Fairbanks before 1920 or

Captain Frederick Mears, of the Alaska
railway commission, said here today be
fore departing for Washington, D. C,
where he will make his report.
The tracks along the Tufnagain arm,
between Seward and Anchorago will
probably not bo completed before 191s

are responsible for the delay, Hears

Washington, NoVi 28. Congress must
burn the midnight oil prodigally if it
would finish its labors on schedule at

early congressional arrivals todnjv-
The mere routine will consume a long
while, leaving but little for the rail
road labor legislation, food embargo
questions and other major legislation
destined to make the closing days of
tho sixty fourth sesion notable.
Republicans frankly say they dom
believe everything fun be "squeezed into
the allotted space and they are willing
thut much shall hang fire, since they
argue they will have more power In
the congress that begins in December,
1917.
Leaders estimated that practically
thirteen weeks will be consumed in ar
my, navy and other regular yearly ant
"regular special" appropriation bills.
This will leave a scant month for oth
er mensurJs of wide importance.
If the supremo court erases the Adam
son bill from the statute books, con
gress cxpeuts presentation of another i
eight hour law. There are ailtlitions to
it contemplated, at any rate, and the
"compulsory investigation before strik

The big sensational scrap of the
whole session, however, will come from
the food embargo measures if these are
pressed as now planned. A row equall

Thousands On Shore Watch
Battle Between Aeroplanes
and Airship
GREAT CHEER GOES UP AS
' SHE PLUNGES INTO SEA
Second Big Raider Set On Fire
By Aeroplane Also Falls
in Sea
H
London, Nov. 28. Eight thousand
feet aloft, above the North sea, British,
hydroplanes sent a German Zeppelin
hurtling down to destruction in flames . -today.
A little earlier, anti-aircraft
guns, co-operating with an aeroplane,
accounted for another German air raid- y
er of York and Durham counties tho
air cruiser also sinking, aflame, into
the water.
Graphic details of tho British success
in repelling the 27th aerial raid made by
tho Germans since the first of the year
were announced today by General Lord .
French, commander in chief of the Bri
tish home forces. He said damage in
lives or property 'from bombs dropped
by the raiders over York and Durham,
count ies during the night were believed
slight
The first Zepoplin, which apparently
entered over Durham, was pursued -by -an
aeroplane as it turned homeward.
Not until theZepcpliu was over the
sea off the Durham coast did the Bri
tish aviator succeed in reaching a vital
part. Then he brought tho great dread
nought of tho uir down, a burst of
flume. '
'A Thrilling Alx Battle.
The second German Zeppelin entered
over "north Midlands, dropping bomba '
at several places," trench's state
ment said. Then she turned homeward
nnd sought to escape, with British aero
pluues pursuing aud anti-aircraft guns -peppering
her aerial course. Finally the
great vessel was apparently struck.
The last part of her journey was irtada
with great difficulty, tho Zepeplin lame-,
ly pressing onward. She woe unable to
reach the coast by daybreak.- Later,
somewhere aloft ou tho Norfolk const,
tho German crew apparently effeeted
repairs. The machine immediately pro-
ceeded eastward, arising rapidly-to a
height of 8,000 feet. Then four naval
aeroplanes attacked the Zeppelin nine
miles at sea- An armed trawler aided -in
tho attack. Finally a whot reached a
vitul part and the great ship sank from
the sky a blazing mass at 0:45 o, m.
Thousands collected on the shore
and breathlessly witnessed the duel ot
forces of the air, water and land for
shore batteries also poured their fire at
one of the sky drendnaughts joining in
the fustllndo from aeroplanes and armed
trawlers.
There was a great cheer from these
spectators of the combat us the Zeppelin
rushed downward, destroyed, like a
great blazing comet.
Germany Has Lost Six. -
Germany has lost one or more of her
Zeppelin fleet on every attempt she baa
made at a raiit over England since Sep
tember 3. tyth last night's score, Ger
many hns lost six giant machines since
that time.
I'se of an inflammatory bullet in
aeroplane rapid fircra and anti-aircraft
guns repelling Zeppelins has made Bri
tish defensive work against the Ger
man raiders particularly effective. Lieu
tenant Kobiiison was the first of the
home guard aviators to bring down his
Zeppelin prey by such a bullet. This
was on September 3, when the raiders
killed two and injured 13 by bomb drop
ping. On September 23 two more Zep
pelins fell victim to England's de
fensive system ono by shots fired from
an acroplnne, the other from tho fire olf
au anti-craft gun. On October 1 the
fourth dreadnaught of tho air was
brought down in similar fashion.
Travelers from England who have
witnessed these Zepeplin raids and de
nt ruction of the raiders say most of the
aerial defensive work is being done by
young British aviators ranging in age
from 18 to 21. They nre boyishly keen
about the "spin" and the greatest riv
alry exists in tho dangerous business. o
attucking the huge aerial cruisers.
