FIRST NATIONAL
BANK DEPOSITS
ARE GROWING
Ono noeds but scan the bank state
ment In this Issue, sotting forth tho
condition of the First National Bank
at the "closo of business, on November
17lh, to observe the wonderoful
growth that Is going on In this com
munity. ' Logan has four banking
Institutions, all holding an enviable
place in the commercial world, for
their stability and for their liberal
methods of doing business with their
various depositors and borrowers.
Tho First National Bank Is ouo of
the oldest banks In tho county. Somo
two years ago, H. E. Crockett, who
was then assistant cashier, was elo
vated to tho position of Cashier and
since that time the bank has shown
a remarkablo increaso, both in Its
doposlts and In the loans. While
Mr. Crockett Is considered one of tho
ablest bankers in tho city, having
been with tho First National Bank
a good many years, tho success of
the Institution and tho growth of tho
past few years is not altogether at
tributed to him. He has associated
with him somo very capable young
accountants and obliging assistants.
On the directorate or the institution
there is to be found some of Cache
county's best citizens, men who com
mand considerable wealth. We con
gratulate tho First National Bank
and Its officers on tho splendid show
ing and wlh thorn continued. busi
ness success.

That tho wor.k which tho Exten

plain by tho November 1C Issuo of
Tho Breeders' Gazette which devotes

agent ready to start on a tour of his
county, of n group of farmers and ex
tension workers on an auto tour of
Inspection, and of tho delegation of
Utah County Farmors that visited
tho Agricultural Collego last sum
mer. In connection with the "pict
ures, Tho Breeders' Gazotto had this
to Bay of tho work of tho Extension
Division: "Tho Extension Division
of tho Utah Agricultural Collego at
Logan has been doing somo Interest
ing work throughout that state
On6 featuro of It Is, thoro Is a. vast
territory to be covered, so that tho
agents of tho collego expcrlenco dif
ficulty In reaching their public. The
collego at Logan Is "tho conter of a
50,000,000 ncro campus." Thro
ugh tho extension division tho coll
ego sends Information of value to
tho farm and tho home, reaching
tho remotest corners of the state.
Wherever trains go tho purpose of
tho collego Is oaslly accomplished.
Last year an extension school of 13
cars covered Utah, going wherever
tracks wero laid. Sheepmen, cattle
men, Irrigators, dry-farmers (and
homomakers wero all appealed to.
Apart from the Inspection and study
of tho various exhibits carried, num
erous meetings wero held, whore
practical lectures wero glvon. A
