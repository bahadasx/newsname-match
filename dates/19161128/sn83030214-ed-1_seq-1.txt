PASTOR'S WIDOW
SENT TO PRISON
Mrs. Sanford, Sentenced
as Thief, Upbraids Clergy
Who Did Not Aid Her '
Mra. Mary A. Sanford, forty-nine
years old, widow of John Sanford, a
< ongrepational clergyman, author and
artist. pleaded guilty to a charge of
petty larceny before Judge Delehanty
ifl (ieneral Session* yesterday. Before
she was sentenced to the penitentiary
for not more than one year Mrs. San?
ford, in a lettei which she handed to
I the court, upbrai.ied tha member* of
the Congregational Church and the
clergy, because. she <.ai<l, they made no
? ffurt to help hor, a penniless widow,
after the death of her husband ifl 1*10.
Mrs. Sanford -,aid her husband died
| from tuberculosi" nine tnontlr; after
they were married, leaving her nothing
but debts. She said that she lived at
! various hotels in New York and Atlan
;:c City and that many of these had
claims against her for unpaid bills.
After vainly tr;. ing to market some
of her husband's privately published
books. she ^aiil, she tried to sell imi
tation pearl jewelry for D. I. Rogov
ii <o., oi* Slf Paaith Avenue. Accord
ing to the tirm, Mrs. Sanford, on April
17 last, took $180 worth of trinkets on
memoranda and never returne.l. She
was indictcd for grand larceny in the
second degree.
"Mr. Sanford waa a Congregational
r.inister,'' she said in her app?al to
th? court, "and I felt that ministers of
that denomination would consider it a
pr;vileg;e to help perpetuate the works
of one of their fraternity. There are
itany wealthy members of the Congre
ifational Church in this city. One of
these, a man, told me hc wouldn't
warry any more if he vere I, but'.ould
get married agan..
"All these men muat have scen that
I was half crazy with grief and worry,
and they veren't even kind. I am a
reasonable being, but it seems to ma
that it is mu:h more picturesque to
become interested in the troubles of
the flavaajea in Africa than in those of
people here at home. I have been
withaat fo**l at tiaiaa for seventy-two
houra. I kn.j 'na- --rving a senter.ee
'or my crime will not expiat; it mor
ally. I shall never feel free until I
have made reparation for every dollar
that I huve taken wrongfully '
In passmg aentence Judge Delehanty
Taid that he was convinced Mrs. San
fard had taken advantage of her posi?
tion as the widow of a clergyman for
four yeaiB to coiiim't crimea, and for
that reason she ought to be punuhed
morr severely than a persons i"ho gets

London, Nov. 27. -Britain will notj
grant a safe conduct to Count Tar-j
nowski, designated Austro-IIurigarian
Ambassador to the I'nited States. The
Tribaaa ia informed that the govern?
ment has rabled its rsfasal te the Stat- '
Department at Washington. Thus, un
loss the count takes passage on a sub
marine, he is not hkelv to make tho
projected royaga to New Y.>rk at th;
time.
The ground on which the refusal i?
baaed ia that, even though internation
al law sanctioBa. the granfing of such a
aafa conduct, tho Austnan and German
embassics in neutral countries have so
far excceded their legitimate function*
that it is impossible for the Ententc
Powers to accede to the requoil.
Lansing Holds Action
Is Without Precedent
fProrn th- IMb'jr- B ira.u ]
Washington, Nov. 27. London's re?
fusal to grant safe conduct to Count
Tarnowski. Austrian Ambassador desig- ,
nate to the I'nited States, created a
decidedly unfavorable impression ifl ,
offical quarters to-day. Some offlci: ls
even intimated that it rr.ight be re?
garded as an affront and lead to an j
unpleasant controversy with Great
Britain.
Seeretary Lansi|g could remembar j
no precedent for.sueh action. The j
Statfl Department nad not asked a safe ,
conduct for Count Tarnowaki, believ- ,
ing that it was unnecessary, because ;
rommonly all diplornatic offlcers are
permitted to pass unmolested to and
from their posts.
Allowed Bernstorff'a Return
It was recalled that when Ambassa- ?
dor von Bcrnstorff returned to this
country after the war broke out he
trnvelled without the expresa consent j
of the Allies. Although hia ship j
Rtopped Bt a British port and he was
known to be on board he waa politely ;
"overlookod."
As the official rejection of Count'
Tarnowski's request for a safe con
doet had not been reccived to-day, offi
dala of the State Department wou!*I ;
not say what action, if any, would be
Uakea. It was hinted strongly. how?
ever, that this government would ex- ,
haust every reaource to get tha new
Ambassador here.
It is even possible, it is declared,
that an American vcaael will be acnt |
for the ambassador. If the dipiomat
were taken otT an American vessel the
caae would be e:.ac'.ly . imilar to that
of Mason and Slidell in the Civil War.
Britain Demanded Release
The two Confedcrate commis=ioners
were seized on a British ship, and
Great Britain demanded tneir releeae.
The Cnited States acceded wh.'ii it
waa poir.ted out that l.ot only were the
comtniisMoners immune because of
their diplornatic suitus, but that the
seuure of any forcigner on u Br.ti n
ship waa illegal.
I'art.cularly irritating is the reason
Rssigr.ed by the British Foreigr Office
lor withhaMiag tl.e papers. Alluaions
in recent communications from the Al?
lies to the improper acMvities of Ttu
ton:c en.bassies in this country have
impressed Adminlstration officials as
impertinent, aa they ?eem to imply a
criticism of the United States for fail
ure to enforce neutrality.
Alleging such reasons for rejecting
louai Tarnowski's application, tlie
Hr:t:sh government presumes to act as
rensor, officials declare, of matters
which are properly of concern to the
Cnited States alone. Furthermore, the
I'nited States, in formally accepting
Tarnowski as the Auatrian envoy. indi
cated ita belief that his activitie? here
would be proper in every way, and this,
diplomatists hold. should be sufflcient
guarantee to the Bntuh Foreign Office.
Act Prejudieial to United Statea
Thia government is hampered ?orne
what bv the fact that it made no for
mal application for Tarnowski's ^a:e
conduct. When news of his d.
t:on came the Allies were BBtifll
a matter of course. Shortly after. the
\ierma Foreign Office asked tne State
Department to transmit the application
for a sat'e conduct. and thi. was done.
but without comment. Technically,
therefore. Great Britain ba* rejeeted
only a requeat of Austria-Hungary. to
which the United Statea was not a
party. . ,
Actually. however. the act s preju?
dieial to the interaata of the Lnited
States, in that it erabarraaaee com
municationa between the American and
Auatrian governmenta. Alao, it is held,
the United States indicated plainly ita
desire for the ambasaador's aafe paa-,
sage when it notif.ed the Allies of his
appointment.
Thus the United Statea is practically,
if not technically, u party to the trana
aetion, and the Britiah government'i
action can only be cor.atrued, many of?
ficials believe. aa an affront.

FAMINE IN GERMANY
NEAR, LONDON HEARS
London. Nov. 28.?"The
Daily Mail" to-day features
what it describes as highly
authentic information that
the food situation in both ?
Germany and Austria-Hun
gary is more desperate than
had been believed. Thir in?
formation is based on the
necessity of thc American of
cials in both countries send
ing urgent demands home for
food.
The newspaper reports (hat
t!ie Americans in the last few
weeks have informed ^ash
ington that their ration
tickets are useless, as there is
litlle or no food to ration the
nation.
"The Daily Mail" says that
this explains the "p;ace
inliigues v luch the Germans
are fomenting in the United
.States and rlsewhere," and
urges the British government
to exert all pressure. especial
ly the blockade, to prevent
Germany from taking advan

"London Posf Says
London. Nov. fa\ Reports received
from the I'nited States that an organ
izc.l effort is heing made there with
peace as the objecti'.e have brought out
several editorials in opposition to such
a niove.
"If ihe Aliies are even reduced to an
armistire by the American inttigues,"
says "The Morning Post," "they would
regard the I'nited States as a traitor
to the cause of world freedom. There
fore we suggest to our American cous
ins that, as they have decided to tak*
no part in the war except :o mak*
money out of it, it would be wisdotn for
them to leave us to fight out what is,
aft*r all. their battle."
German* Want Seata America
"The Morning Post" argues that the
Germans are willing for peace immedi
ately. and would give the Kntente every?
thing they desire, but only on one condi
tion namely, that Germany be allowed
a frce hand in Central and South Amer?
ica.
"We understand." the newspaper
adds, "that condition has been put for?
ward. of course. discreetly and unotti
cially, by the German government and
that it hns been rejected by the Aliies
But why should it be rejected?
"We :ire selling our South American
securities. and if the Americans really
want peace and do not object to havint'
Germany t'or a neighbor, v.hy should
Fngland intervene? Any time ir. tho

After capturing the town the Ger

The conrplete union at the forcti

doubtless achieved to-day ?n the re?
gion just to the northwest of Alex?

eastward from Craiova have estab

In the upper Alt dtetiiot another ?K
