AFTER ILLNESS OF A WEEK
Mrs. Mattie Ladow, well beloved
pioneer Pendleton woman and widow
of Congressman Ladow, who repre
sented Oregon at Washington some
40 years ago, died at her home on
Beauregard street this morning. She
had been ill for a week and the im
mediate cause of death was bronchial
pneumonia. The funeral is to be
held at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon from
the Folsom chapel.
Mrs. Ladow was 72 years of age
and had resided in Pendleton the
greater part of her life, having come
here In the sixties. Her husband.

and he died shortly after that time,

ARCTIC OtVLS ARRIVE
For the first time in a num
ber of years, Arctic or snowy
owls are making their appear-
ance in Umatilla county. A half 4
dozen or more have been re-
ported within the past week,
and, though the Oregon laws
protect the bird, at least three
have been killed.
The Arctic owl is a native to 4
the far north and seldom strays
this for south. Ten year ago
quite a number were reported
to have been seen in Oregon
and reports from Spokane are
that they have visited that sec-
tlon as late as seven years ago. 4
Their migration south this year
Is interpreted by some as an
omen of a hard winter. It Is
probable they have been driven
south bv hard storms and lack
of food
The first Arctic owl reported
hereabouts was killed about a
week a;o by a local hunter after 4

The Roumanians are steadily retreat

river Argeshu line and attempt a
new stand. Sofia announced the Bul
garians had crossed tbe Danube near
Rahova, capturing the town.
The German sqpadron returned
after the Lowestoft raid without
sighting any enemy vessels except
"watching the ship" which sunk.
LONDON, Nov. 28. The admiralty
reported the armed trawler Harval
is missing. It is presumed the Har
val is the vessel the Germans de
stroyed during the Lowestoft raid.

Thousands of Spectators Watch
Air Battle off Coast of Eng
land in Which Two Enemy
Airships are Brought Down.
ZEPP DAMAGE IS SLIGHT
LONDON, Nov. 28. Lord
French, commander of the Brit
ish home forces, announced
that two raiding Zeppelins
were destroyed last night. One
fell flaming on the Durham
coast. Another was destroyed
nine miles off Norfolk. It waa
headed seaward when hit. Both
fell into the ocean. Aero
planes finished one and anti
aircraft guns on hydroplanes
wrecked the second.
French said the twenty-seventh
air raid caused slight dam
age in York and Durham
counties.
The official statement de
clared : "The first Zeppelin ap
parently entered over Dur
ham. An aeroplane pursued
it as it turned homeward. The
running sky battle continued
until the aeroplane shell hit a
vital part
"The second entered over the north
midlands, dropping bombs in wveral
places. It turned homeward and
sought to escape as tha anti-aircraft
gun volleyed. The Zeppelin was
crippled And proceeded slowly but
waa unable to reach the coaat by
daybreak. Over the Norfolk ooaM
the crew effected repair. The ma
chine proceeded eastward and rose
rapidly for eight thousand feet. Four
navy hydroplanes attacked the Zep
pelin nine miles seaward. ' An armed
trawler aided. The Zeppelin fell at
ix thirty-five . m.'
Thousands of spectators on the
shore witnessed the battle. Coast
batteries shelled the raiders. There
was a tremendous cheer as the raider
fell blazing.
Germany has lost one or more Zep
plins In every English raid since Sep
tember third. The total is six. three
being super-Zeppelins. , British rapid
fires use inflamatory bullets. . They
are particularly effective. British avi
ators fighting the Zeppelins were
aged from eighteen to twenty one.
