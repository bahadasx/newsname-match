Dreaded Foot and Mouth Disease
Reported to Have Again Made
Its Appearance.
Alarm over the possibility of a
new outbreak of the foot-and-mouth
disease spread Monday and
was reflected in quarantine nnd
embargo orders. The Union Stock
yards nt Chicago have declared1 n
quarantine against all cattle, sheep,
horsos nnd swine originating in
Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska. A
trninload of livestock was held up
Lat Clinton, Iowa, for examination.
Dr. O. D. Dyson, Stnte Veterinar
ian of Illinois, issued orders on the
stockyards of Chicago and East
St. Louis forbidding the shipment
of nny livestock except for imme
diate slaughter. This, it was ex
plaihcd, affects only a small pro
portion of livestock handled there.
The animals affected are those not
yet heavy enough for slaughter and
which nrc rcshipped from the yards
to farms for further feeding. At
this time this traffic i said to be
light.
At Kansas City the embargo es
tablished Saturday night probably
will remnin effective until Wednes-
day, by which time it will be known
whether suspected animals have
contracted the malady. Federal in
spdetons are at work among sus
pected herds.
