SHE LIKES TO
MOTHER PEOPLE
Ever meet a girl Who liked to
"mother" everyone around? If not
get acquainted with one in "Going
Down to Molly's" a story in the
Christmas number of the Woman's
Home Companion. The writer says:
"The chair was the sort of chair
into which one sinks and sinks until
every burhp and hollow of one's an
atomy has been softly adjusted to
meet its curves. The firelight had
passed from flickering into steady
glow. Sounds of music and youth
ful voices and dancing feet came
from far away, and across the hearth
in the great wing chair sat the girl
who was a woman who mothered
Molly. Evidently she had the habit
of mothering. It was in her quiet
eyes, In her gentle ways, in her smile,
half laughing half tender. And yet
she was such a slip of a girl herself.
"Howoldareyon?" Keneth askei.
"Twentyfour.' Another girl would
have laughed, coquetted. She merely
took if for granted that he had some
good reason for asking, and told him
"Molly was eighteen last month,"
she added. 'It makes me feel much
older than twenty four to think of
that.'
"Twenty four! He looked as
though he had heard good news
Why the girl was absurdly young.
for all her mothering ways. , He was
well past twenty-eight himself and
he really must be going. When one
wanted to stay as much as he wanted
to stay now, it was quiet time to go."
