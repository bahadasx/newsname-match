THE DAY
O
(By Mrs. George W. Bland.) - m
Ye shall not afflict any widow, or <
fatherless child. If thou afflict them 1
in any wise, and they cry at all unto 1
me, I will surely hear their cry; and <
ray wrath shall wax hot, and I will <
kill you with the sword; and your <
wives shall be widows and your chil- I
dren fatherless.?Ex. 2 2-2 2:^H 1
And it is as true of America as it I
was of the Hebrew nation. .'
The strength of a state Is in its :
patriotic citizenship. Patriotism, or 1
love of country, is an outgrowth of _
love of home. The child with no
home to love cannot love its country. '
The child grows up and not loving his
country defies its laws and becomes a 1
criminal. The wealth of a state is in
the moral, mental and physical 1
strength of its citizens. Let us leave 1
the moral and the mental phase of it 1
to the preacher and the teacher or to 1
the reader's imagination, and address 1
ourselves to the physical.
Every farmer knows that to pro
duce a good animal the young must
be properly nourished, and sheltered.
If either is lacking -when needed, the
young animal 'is "stunted," and its
size, strength and beauty are measurably
diminished and its usefulness
impaired. So the child, who; at any
time lacks proper food; raiment or
shelter must forever be of less size,
less strength, less beauty and less; i
use than God intended. To a greater
degree! are the: strength of mind and
morals reduced, but I promised that
others might use this argument.
It -was once thought that -the;
world's wealth was limited and the
m ore other folks had theless was
left for us. We are Just beginning
to learn that wealth is unlimited and
that it results from the intelligent development
of natural resources, and
that the more wealth our neighbors
have the easier it is for us to procure
a competence. And that the more ;
inefficient men and women there! are
in our community/ the harder it is for ;
us to earn a living.
There are in "Greater Clarksburg" ;
a number of widowed mothers who
cannot care for their helpless chil
dren and at. the same time .earn;a living:
for them. It Is better for them
and better, for the community'that the ;
family ties be not. broken. In every
aspect of the .case it iB better -that
the mother have an opportunity to
earn a living for herself and her little
ones and at the same time keep the
family together. Therefore, the.,need
of a day nursery, a place where the
mother can leave-her. children while |
she* goes out to earn their bread. At
No. 131 West Pike street such pro- ,
vision is being made. Af ten the .nursery
is once .established it should be
self-supporting; for it.Is-the Intention f

PITTSBURG, Nov. 28.?Acute poverty
due to inability to obtain work
disappeared from Pittsburg one year
ago, but the prosperous condition of
business in this district has resulted in
a decided increase in the number of
charity cases, resulting from the use
of alcoholocl drinks and the desertion
of families, according to the annual
report of the Associated Charities Just
made public.
"There seems to be a relation between
the great demand for labor and
the Increase in drinking in -that the
worker feels, If - he loses one Job on
account of intemperance it will be
easy to find another," the report says.
"The association, finds that the large
pay envelope has led to family desertion
in many instances; in fact.desertion
increased-very decidedly last
year."

WOMEN
A CONGE
Will Take Up Fight for Adoption
of Federal Amendment at
Opening of Session.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28?Leading
women suffragists are arriving here
from all parts of the United States to
line up for a fight before Congress for
the purpose of securing, a vote on the
federal suffrage amendment as soon
as possible after the aesgion begins on
December 4. They hope to have the
amendment finally submitted)* to the
states 'for ratification before the adjournment
of the Congress recently
elected.
A large corps of women will be assigned
to the task of conducting the
lobby work in what is expected to be
the most vigorous attempt- yet made
to' Jam through the "amendment.
On the strength of written pledgee
received i by suffrage offi cials from
many successful candidates it Is predicted
that the Issue will be Injected
into the deliberations of the House
ana senate at an eariy stage: xno
National American Woman Suffrage
Association announced today that a
host'.of candidates of both' parties
made pre-election promises to the'.as-;
sociatlon that. If elected they would
support the 'amendment. " 1; -,
Among those already on the' ground,
and primed for a fight Is 'Miss Maud.
Younger, of San -Francisco, who had
charge of the congressional lobby
work, here last winter. - In the pre^el
ection days' she took the stump for
the woman's party: in Wyoming,
Utah, Nevada, Montana and Gall forIn
the forthcoming drive upon Congress
she: will have as one of her
chief: lieutenants [Mrs. \ Walter McNab
Miller, of Missouri, first vice president
of the association. Because of
the non-partisan attitude assumed by
the suffrage association; in rthe" campaign
the women assert' there -will, be
no party opposition 40 their plans in
either house. They expect to .encounter
but little friction: at. either
end of the capital; although the house
probably will be under Republican,
and the Senate under Democratic control.
, -v;::;:Other
women here to y aid IMithe"

Lucy Burns, vice chairman of? the
Congressional. Union; Miss Anne'Martin,
