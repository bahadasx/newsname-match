A GOOD FRIEND
A good friend stands by you when
In need. Hennlngton people tell how
Doan's Kidney Pills have stood the
test. Mr. McGulre endorsed Doan's
over ten years ago and again confirms
the story. Could you ask for more
convincing testimony?
P. J. McGulre, 211 Maple St.. Ben
nington, says: "I suffered from dull,
heavy pains In my back. If I Btooped
over, sharp pains caught me and on
damp days or If I caught cold, the
trouble was worse. Mornings I felt
tired and sore all over. I learned of
Doan's Kidney Pills and tried them.
They removed the pains in my back
and I was cured of all tho other an
noyances." (Statement given Decem
ber 16, 1905.)
On August 24, 1916 Mr. McGulre
added: "I can still say a good word
for Doan's Kidney I'ills. I have had
no occasion to use them recently."
Price 50c, at all dealers. Don't sim
ply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
Mr. McGulre has twice publicly re
commended. F ostor-Milbum Co.,

mittee of the Vermont asociation for

the first hundred Christmas seals Is
sued by the Vermont association for
the prevention of tuberculosis. 1 most
heartily approve of the purpose of the
organization, ami wish you success in
your efforts to combat the dmtded I
disease, tuberculosis, in Vermont." I
In addition to the endorsement of i
the governor, the Vermont Federation
of Woinens clubs has decided to
abandon the sale of Its special seal '
this year and urge all of the affiliated
clubs to Jttni) in and push the sale
of tho red cross seal. In most of the
towns members of the clubs will have
charge of the local sale. Mrs. Frank
E. Howo has been asked to appoint a
local manager In Bennington county.
Moreover most of the business men's
organizations of the stato have en
dorsed the sale of the seals and prom
ised to cooperate In making it a big
success. There Is an extra Interest
in the sale thi3 year because for the
first time Vermont has an active or
ganization for the prevention of tuber
culosis. After a careful study of conditions
in tho state the asociation has map
ped out a definite program lor fight
ing consumption which has been en
dorsed by the leading physicians and
the welfare workers of the slate. The
returns from the red cross seals will
determine how much of the program
can be put Into actual operation.

WASHINGTON MAY ACT
On England's Refusal of Passport to
Austrian Ambassador.
Washington, Nov. 28. Tho refusal
of Great Britain to grant safo conduct
to Count von Tarnow, the new ambas
sador from Austria-Hungary to the
United States may create another
controversy with the entente powers.
It was learned last night that tho
state department has not made a for
mal request for a safe conduct for the
Austrian ambassador, but has confined
itself to a transmission of the request
of the Austrian government for such a
courtesy. Therefore, it is probable
that If tho Issue Is to bo made up It
will be necessary for the United
States now to make such request on
Its own account.

Counter Attacks.
London, Nov. 27. All hope has been
abandoned that the Rumanian armies
retreating in Wallachia can stem the
Teuton avalanche until it reaches the
Bucharest line. On the whole Walla-
chltn front, on the Danube and In the

I miles beyond tho Alt and are still re

The whole Rumanian bank of the

TO
APPLY SAGE TEH
A few applications of Sage Tea and
Sulphur brings back its vigor,
color, gloss and youthfulness.
Common garden sage brewed Into a
heavy tea with sulphur added, will
turn gray, streaked and faded hair
beautifully dark and luxuriant. Just
a few applications will prove a revel
ation if your hair is fadlng,Btreaked
or gray. Mixing the Sage Tea and
Sulphur recipe at home, though, is
troublesome. An easier way is. to get
a 50 cent bottle of Wyeth's Sage and
Sulphur Compound at any drug store
all ready for use. This is the old
time recipe improved by the addition
of other ingredients.
While wispy, grey, faded hair is not
sinful, we all desire to retain our
youthful appearance and attractive
ness. By darkening your hair with
Wyeth's Sago and Sulphur Compound,
no one can tell, because it does it so
naturally, so evenly. You just, damp
en a sponge or soft brush with It and
draw this through your hair, taking
one small strand at a time; by morn
ing all gray hairs have disappeared,
and, after another application or two,
your hair becomes beautifully dark,
glossy, soft and luxuriant.
This preparation is a delightful toi
let requisite and Is not intended for
tho cure, mitigation or prevention of
disease.

RETURNS All BUT THE MOW
Miss Nellie E. Rockwood Has Start
ling Experience While on Way
Home Last Night.
Miss Nellie E. Rockwood, a clerk
in the Ritchie dry goods store, was
held up and robbed of her handbag
Monday evening while on the way to
the home of her parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Burt Ruckwood, oil Prospect street.
There was only about $1.50 In change
In the handbag. The young woman's
principal regret is tho loss of her
glasses.
The holdup took place in the lane
made by two rows of small evergreen
trees leading from Weeks street to
the house which stands some distance
back fom the highway. The young
woman had traveled about half the dls
trance from the street to the house
when the holdup man stepped from be
hind one of the trees.
At first convinced that the man had
wandered into the grounds in an in
toxicated condition, the young woman
attempted to pass but her effort in
this direction was intercepted by the
man who blocked her way. Then she
observed that her assailant was equip
ped in real highwayman style. He
wore a black handkerchief about the
lower part of his face, obscuring all
but his eyes. He also carried a small
flashlight which he used to locate the
handbag.
Realizing that the man intended to
attack her, Miss Rockwood began run
ning toward the home of Henry Lock
wood. The man, however, soon caught
up with her, seized her arm and In
spite of her screams tore the handbag
from her grasp. Once In possession
of the bag the highwayman ran across
the lot. Jumped a fence and disappear
ed .'. -:.
Her assailant, Miss Rockwood stated
this morning was a slightly built man
w ho wore a cap, either a sweater or a
short closely fitting coat and legglns.
She was unable to obtain any view of
his features which were completely
masked by the black cloth.
The strangest feature of the holdup
is the fact that Miss Rockwood did not
lose her glasses, after all. When she
arrived at home this noon she found
awaiting her a small parcels post
package. Opening the package she
found that it contained her glasses,
her fountain pen, the little pocket
book which was in the handbag and
some papers including receipts from
the telephone company. The outside
wrapper of the package was composed
of a small paper bag and her name
and address were printed on the paper
in imitation of tho typewritten ad
dress on one of the' telephone re
ceipts. BOIVIN-LASSOR
