to the interpreter. The prosecuting

After their interpreter had explained

Oiv Associated Press)
CHARLESTON. Nov. 28. House
and Senate worked quickly for few
minutes this morning in an dffort to
reach a speedy adjournment, but so:
many last minute bits of business appeared
it was noon before the end of
the special session was a reality. i
There were the usual sights and!
sounds of cheers., and everybody expressed
satisfaction it was over. Re-j
ports of conference committees appointed
yesterday to bring House anil j
Senate together on registration and i
primary bills were made and the bills |
were finally passed in both houses.
They will become effective 90 days j
from today.
The House passed the registration I
bill by a vote of 4ii to 19. Mr Hughes I
of McDowell, voted with the Demo '
rats, explaining that the bill was not
as good a measure in its final amended :
form as the existing statute, but when J
ii wr.s apparent that a number of Republicans
were not recorded as voting
he changed his vote.
The primary bill passed by a vole
of 47 to 21. As reported from the conference
committee it restored compulsory,
primaries to the election system
disappointing a large number In
both houses who had openly declared:
the system a crude and expeusive ex-t
perlment.
In the Senate the registration bill i
passed 17-8 and primary 29 to 6.
The appropriation bill providing for.
the expenses of the special session also!
was passed. Senators Beekwlth. Hogg,'
Kurnp and Morton voted against it. j
Mr. Morton on a question of personal
privilege delivered an address \
in which tie pleaded for united action
by both parlies In the coming session;
particularly on the Virginia debt.

investigation whs not apparent until
late in the day. When the legislature
adjourned Saturday it was believed,
that Governor Hatfield's friends would
he able to induce hesitating members ;
of the majority to vote for such a res- j
nlutlnn, but .Monday morning came
with four members still holding out.
This was apparent when Son. Oliver'
S. Marshall of Hancock, introduced a i
resolution confining the business of j
the session to the matters then before
the Senate Senator Blessing, the
Republican floor leader, at once mov-!
ed a recess, and although the motion j
carried. Mr. Marshall voted against j
It. and with hint Senators Rosenbloom.
Miller and Hillings. Confer-1
ences followed, and it became known
in the afternoon that friends of the
movement had decided to give it up, in
deference to certain Republicans, |
who, while they believed the alleged j
election frauds should be investigated, I
did not belive that it should be done
in this way and at this time. As no
other plan was forthcoming, no more
was beard of the resolution.
This left the way open for a com-1
promise on the registration and pri-!
mary election bils. Democrats and I
Republicans in the house were wide i
apart on the amendments to the sen-1
ate bill and at the close of the morn-j
ing session had voted on a suspens-1
ion of the rules to pass the registra- i
tion bll as it had been amended, but
the announcement of the vote had
been held over until the afternoon ses-!
sion. Amendments to the primary bill
had restored the fusion feature, but I
bad so changed the measure that ex-1
ecuttvc committees of every party In
every political division of the state
could declare for primaries or con- j
vention, and their declaration could!
only be overthrown .by petition from
forty per cent, of the qualified electors
of the party at the last prcced-!
Ing election. Amendments to the registration
bill brought the last meeting I
of the county court to hear final reg-;
istratlon appeals from the first Mon- j
day of October to the last Monday, j
and changed the phraseology.
When the bouse re-convened at i

floor loader, said:
"I deBire lo announce, so that we I
may all full understand the situn-;
tion, that after we have considered ,
the registration and primary bills now
before ua we will have nothing further
to consider at this session. This
agreement. I understand, has also been
reached in the Senate."
Democrats who had voted against
placing the registration bill on its
final passage at once began, to change
their votes, and when the result was
announced. It was found "6 were for
It and none against It.
The primary bill then appeared. Mr.
Hughes calling up the amendment
which says that every candidate must
be a bona fide member of his party
and In full sympathy with Its principles.
Mr. Duty explained that the amendment
had been Inserted In the hope
that It would prevent minority parties
