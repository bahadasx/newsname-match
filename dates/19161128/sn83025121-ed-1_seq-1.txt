The despatch first quoted ibovdi '
comes from th Arsociated lres

statement given to him last night by .
Trevino himself.: The Cafranza
general added that two hundred '
Villistas have been trapped in th
city and are fighting desperately ex-
pecting destruction this morning:
The interrupted communication be
tween the City of Chihuahua .and
Juarez has been restored and the
messages tell of the fiercest fighting
that even blood stained northern
Mexico has seen for many years.
The second message quoted comes
from unofficial sources ahd reached
private individuals at El Paso late
yesterday evening too late to al
low of any confirmation being ob
tained. It declared that the gam
son under Trevino .bad. evacuated
the city and that General Villa is
in control. The de facto officials in
Juarez admitted the possibility of
this report, and especially that por
tion of it which asserted that the
garrison was compelled to flee when
the supply of shells was' exhausted.
It was officially reported here yes
terday that Villa had been success
ful in the five day battle that has
raged around the City 6f Chihua
hua, and had entered the place. This
account of the fighting stated that
his first act was to open the prisons
and liberate all the inmates, ' lie
then proceeded to" force the" popu
lace to assist his men in entrenching
the city and making other prepara

No rqort of his alleged subse

From Juarez comes the announce
ment that Judge Francisco Marti

and is retreating to the mountains.
