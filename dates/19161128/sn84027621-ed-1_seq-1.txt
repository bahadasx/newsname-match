IF THE WEATHER REHAIS
The Star reporter had but little
over half an hour at the fair grounds
this morning, but in that time saw
enough to warrant him in thinking
we need only fair weather and a big
crowd to have a most successful
show.
All the exhibits are not in but the
agricultural buildipg already makes a
fine show. Not only are Mcintosh,
Orange Springs, Burbank, Kendrick
and many other sections "of our own
county in evidence, but the Lake View
section of Putnam, nine miles beyond
our county line, is on hand with a fine
display.
The live stock show is going to be
good. Many fine cattle, horses and
. mules are in the pens. The hog show
is great. There are over a hundred
Hampshire3 to show for the work of
the pig clubs. There are a number of
other fine specimens of blooded stock.
Fine corn is there is plenty, and
the citrus show will be good. The
fern and flower show is of unusual
size and beauty.
The women Godblessum are do
ing their share anjj then some. They
have a beautiful display in their own
building articles of utility and
things of art, objects of interest and
storied antiques. Mrs. Perdue took
the reporter by the ear and led him,
she said, to see the prettiest thing at
the fair. Seeing he was being pulled
directly toward a group of young
matrons, the reporter prepared to
assent, "when he was whirled around
and told to observe a cat in a doll
hcuse. Mighty fine cat, tho; admired
by everybody. '
Judging by a fleeting glance, the
educational display is excellent.
The ladies also preside in the edu
cational and culinary departments,
and run the branch library, beside
being more or less principally more
everywhere else.
There's not an object at-the fair,
Wherever you begin it,

Without a woman in it.
They are particularly in evidence in
the subject of eats. They have full
possession of the big restaurant,
where they will serve what Bret Harte
called a tabledote dinner every day.
They: pleased everybody today, and

to eat.
In addition to the restaurant, the
ladies have a lunch counter over by
the rest arbor, where excellent cof
fee is always on tap, the branches of
the ham sandwich tree are always
laden, and oysters can be prepared in
any style at ten minutes notice.
The industrial hall lacks a lot of
being filled. The biggest display is
that of "Phoslime," which has a large
space and a most instructive display.
The 0. K. Grocery has a large and
attractive booth, which Mrs. Harvey
Clark, after most tastefully and pret
tily arranging has posted herself in,
intending to serve delicious coffee
and dainty tid-bits- to her friends
which is everybody.
The Ocala Christian Science So
ciety has a booth from which litera
ture is being distributed by Mrs. Sam
Leigh.
The poultry show is fine, with all
birds from tremendous turkeys to
dainty doves. It promises to be bet
ter than that of last year.
The colored people have done nobly.
They have devoted their old building
to their art and household display,
and beside have taken Mclver & Mac
Kay's building and filled it with the
first-fruits of their fields, groves
and gardens.
The carnival people have their
shows in shape and are ready to
Amuse the people. They seem to have
ood line-up. It should be said
re that these people have been

hangers on, and a couple of fakes,

FIGHT III HIGH
HI OF FOOD
Was Started, by New York House
wives and Promises to Become
Nation-Wide
(Associated Press)
New York, Nov. 28. The fight on
the high cost of food, started by
the Housewives' League and certain
city officials here, is spreading. The
promoters today predicted it would
become nation-wide. President Burns
of the New York Mayors' association,
announced he would request the may
ors of all New York cities, President
Wilson and the governors of states to
issue a proclamation urging people to
abstain from eating eggs for two
weeks. A two weeks boycott on eggs
was started here today.
INTEND TO DO WITHOUT EGGS
Chicago, Nov. 28. The Women's
City Club here today pledged its
members to refrain from using eggs
as long as the present high prices
continued. The Chicasro Political
Equality League adopted a resolution
advocating a four weeks boycott.
pie material for several hours of fun,
and we believe they will succeed.
The fair opened this morning with
the Woodmen parade. The Woodmen
had a good many difficulties to con
tend with, but they did very well.
Fort King degree team, Captain Har
ris inxcommand, led the procession,
and was followed bv a scruad from
DeLand, under command of . Capt.
Clausem. After these came the lodge
goat, a large and ferocious animal,
with branching horns and a llhell
like a fertilizer factory. He was se
curely confined in a strong cage,
which was hauled on a big truck en
gineered by Jim Fennell. After the
goat's cage strode a stalwart man
looking like a headsman of old, for
he had a mask over his face and car
ried the father of all the axes on his
shoulder. Next came another truck
carrying the stump, the camp altar,
with axe sticking in it. The pro
cession was closed by a number of
Woodmen on foot and in carriages,
and the excellent carnival band.
It was supposed that-Judge W. W.
Anderson of Jacksonville, a leading
Woodman and fine'orator, would speak
at the grandstand, but the judee could
not leave his duties in Jacksonville.
His place was taken by Mr. J. S.
Blitch of Montbrook, a Woodman of
high degree and an eloquent speaker.
One of the Most Interesting Features
of the Fair will Take Place
Tomorrow Morning
The second annual industrial parade
of fair week will start tomorrow
morning promptly at 10 o'clock. The
line of march will be formed on North
Main street, between the postoffice
and May street. Starting, the parade
will move south on Main street to
Ocklawaha avenue, east on Ockla
waha avenue to Hazel street, south on
Hazel street to Fort King avenue,
west on the avenue to Main street,
thence around the north side of the
courthouse square and out Broadway
to the fair grounds. It is expected
that this year's spectacle will be wit
nessed by much larger crowds than
witnessed it last year. The parade
last year was held on the opening day
of the fair, and was so successful that
an effort was made to have it repeat
ed on Thanksgiving Day.

OVER THE MUCH DIS
PUTED CITY
(Associated Press)
Juarez, Nov. 28. General Gon
zales, the Juarez commander, wil
lead the reinforcements for. the Chi
huahua City garrison. Troops are
being assembled at Sauz station, it
was announced here.
SHORT OF CARTRIDGES
El Paso, Nov. 28. United States
officials here today claimed to have
received positive information that
Carranza's forces had evacuated Chi
huahua City because of an ammuni
tion shortage.
TREVINO IN RETREAT
El Paso, Nov. 28. Private mes
sages last night said that Villa was
proceeding north and is in control of
Chihuahua City, which General Tre
vino is supposed to have abandoned
and to be proceeding southward.
According to a report, Trevino is
said to have said he would return
north, after effecting a junction with
General Murgia and would then re
capture Chihuahua.
The message from Trevino was
sent in code from Suaz, via Ojinaja,
and, according to Carranza officials, it
said Villa was moving north and
Trevino ordered the detached garrison
on the Mexican northwestern line to
concentrate in Juarez. The counte
nances of the civil and military men
in the Juarez headquarters clearly
showed the seriousness of the news.
BIG PACKING
Another Misfortune for the Camp
Bennett Grove at Istachatta.
Ocala will Pack Its Oranges
Mr. A. R. Sandlin, manager for the
citrus exchange here, received a tele
gram this morning from Mr. I. F.
Bennett, stating that the big and
modern packing house at Istachatta
on the Camp-Bennett grove burned
last night, together with all of the
machinery, supplies and a large quan
tity of fruit.
Mr. Bennett had packed and shipped
12 carloads or 3500 boxes of fruit and
has yet to pack between 12,000 and
15,000 boxes. Mr. Sandlin is hurrying
field boxes to Mr. Bennett and the
fruit will be rushed to Ocala and
packed in the Ocala packing house.
This will throw a large quantity of
fruit on this house unexpectedly but
the management says they are amply
able to handle it and it will give work
to many packers. Mr. Bennett has
shipped his fruit heretofore through
the citrus exchange but did his own
packing at the grove.
The Istachatta grove has had a ser
ies of accidents of late. They have a
new "steam mule," or heavy gasoline
tractor. While attempting to load it
on a big barge a short time ago, it
took a dive into the river and it was
a herculean job to get it out again.
A driver carelessly, a few days later,
drove a fine pair of mules off the
lighter into the river and they were
both drowned, and now comes Hhe
burning of ttie entire packing 'house
plant. " t?Y --.;rr;
The property was partially insured,
but the loss will be very heavy, and is
particularly unfortunate, coming in
the heart of the packing season.

RUMANIAN LIKE HAS GIVEN UNDER THE STRAIN OF
THE TEUTONIC INVASION
(Associated Press)
lne leutonic semi-circle around
Bucharest and the Rumanian armies is
gradually but steadily being drawn
closer. Berlin reported substantial
success, including the capture of
Giurgiur, thirty-seven miles from
Bucharest, and Curtea de Arges, on
the Argechu river, 80 miles north
west. In occupying the latter town
the Teutons apparently drove the Ru
manians from the Topolog line and
may even have broken the Argechu
line near its northern end. It was
along this line the Rumanians were
expected to make a defensive stand.
. Considerable interest is attached to
reports of artillery activity coming
from the Ypres, Arras and Armen
tieres districts on the western front,
British reports said the British bom
barded that sector last night and the
Germans today. Berlin reports re
cently declared the indications were
accumulating that the entente allies
planned attacks at a new point on the
western front.
Berlin said Teutonic forces repulsed
the entente attacks in the Monastir
region with heavy losses.
Paris reported that the Serbians
repulsed German counter attacks in
the Cerna region.
RUMANIA'S HOPEFUL REPORT
London, Nov. 28i The Rumanian
military situation is improving for
Rumanians, according to a wireless
from Bucharest via Rome, The Teu
tonic armies are said to be making no
material progress. The Rumanians
are retreating in perfect order and on
a settled front.
DASHED TO THEIR DOOM
London, Nov. 28. Two Zeppelins
were destroyed during last night's
raid on the northeast coast of Eng
land. Their crews perished. The air
ships burst into flames and fell into
the sea after being attacked by air
planes, said an official statement. One
was nine miles at sea on the return
voyage when she wrecked. The cas
ualties and damage caused by the
raid are believed to be small, said
the statement.
SEVEN AIRSHIPS THIS YEAR
Seven German airships have been
destroyed in England this year. Six
were brought down in other fields.
Official reports don't say how many
airships crossed the coast of York
shire and Durham and Midland coun
ties bombarded.
TEUTONS GAIN MORE GROUND
Berlin, Nov. 28. The Teutons in
Western Rumania today continued
their drive for Bucharest, said the war
office. New operations have begun,
and additional ground trained. The
Bulgarians captured an imjortant
Danube town, Giugiu, on ,the railroad
south of Bucharest. Curtea de Argos,
south of Campulung, was also captur
ed. ;
RAID ON ENGLISH COAST
Berlin, Nov. 28. An official Ger
man statement said German naval
forces made another raid near Lowe
stoft on the English coast, capturing
one vessel.
