which were the key to the defenses
of the city proper:
The de-facto infantry met these
charges with counter charges and the
hnltlo waged back and forth in this
narrow street until the Villa bandits
were driven out of the mouth of the
avenue on the plains where they were
raked with machine gun fire from the
housetops and the artillery fire which
had supported effectively the infantry
efforts.
Late Saturday afternoon a small
band of Villa bandits took a foothold
in the church of Santa Rio de Guada

been dispersed.
The night was spent in expectation

Mexican Newspaper Says He
Has Started Uprising
In America.
El Paso, Tex., Nov. 27. Roosevelt
has started a revolution against Presi
dent Wilson, according to a dispatch
printed in El Democrat, the leading
newspaper of Chihuahua City, which,
however, qualified the report by
printing a question mark in the head
ing. The dispatch, which appears in the
issue ot tlie 22d of yiis month, is
placed under a Mexico City date. It
reads as follows:
"Alarming rumors have been cir
culating in this city which say that
Col. Theodore Roosevelt heads a rev
olution that has broken out in several
States of the American Union, with
the object of overthrowing President
Wilson, who, Roosevelt claims, au
thorized various electoral frauds in
order to triumph in the past election.
"High officials in this city and some
of tho diplomats state with confidence
that this rumor is a canard of tho
American yellow press, which is hos
tile to Wilson. The American am
bassador already has telegraphed to
Washington in order to inform him
self as to the truth of the report."
CALIFORNIA ALL IN

gin of 3,806 votes over tlie highest
republican in the vote of the entire
slate. The figures were:
Francis J. Heney, highest demo
crat, 466,200.

The lowest democratic elector,
Mrs. Carrie L. Tyler, was found to

TEUTONS CROSS
THEDANUBE
And Claim to Have Effected
Junction 47 Miles from
Capital.
RUSSIANS NOT AT HAND
Claims on Macedonian Front
Conflict Little Activity
Manifested.
Londpn, Nov. 27. To the north or
the heights in Western Moldavia near
Oftuz, the Rumanians are offering
strong resistance to the southward
advance of the Teutons. On all these
sectors attempts by the Austro-Ger-mans
to advance have been held back
by the Rumanians.
As yet there has been no indica
tion of the arrival of Russian rein
forcements to aid the Rumanians on
the Walhchian plains, but the Russo
Rumanian troops in Dobrudja arc ac
tive, possibly in an endeavor to push
back the invaders to the Tchernavoda
Constanza railway line. Sofia re
ports that this reinforced army in
tended a general attack along the en
tire front, but has been compelled to
confine itself to partial attacks.
Berlin says: Gen. von Falkcn1-
hayn's trpops invading western Ru
mania from the north and west have
eueciea a junction wun c leiu marsnat
von Mackensen's forces that have ad
vanced from the south and crossed
the Danube into Rumanian territory.
Driving ' toward Bucharest. Gen.
Mackensen's advance has reached tho
outskirts of .Alexandria, 47 miles from
the Rumanian capital.
The Danube has risen to 'a high'
level says the report, but nevertheless
von Mackensen's entire army intend
ed for the western Rumanian opera
tion has crossed the river under his
personal inspection.
In the Macedonia theater, bad
weather prevails and there has been
no infantry action except on the left
wing of the entente allied line where
the Italians have made further prog
ress toward Trnova near tlie Mona-stir-Prcsba
lake road, according to
Paris. This statement, as regards
the gain is contradicted by the Sofia
war oilice which says an Italian at
tack here was repulsed and that the
attackers lost a large quantity of war
materials. Sofia also denies a recent
French report that the French had
captured the town of Dabromir, say
ing the Bulgars are fully in control
there.
The French front also is experi
encing another spell of inclement
weather and except for small attacks
at various points, little activity has
been displayed by either side.
