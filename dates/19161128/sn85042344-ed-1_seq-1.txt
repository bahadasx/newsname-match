There have been many campaigns In

than $200,000 was contributed in that

NEW CITY CHEMIST
WILL TEST MILKS
Doctor Hawley to Install a
Laboratory for Noted
Specialist's Work.
AK K A NO KME NTS were completed
yesterday whureby tho city will
secure the exclusive services of Dr. C.
E. Hammer, a noted chemist and bac
teriologist, whoso duties solely will he
to make tests of milks, waters and
other materials for the city.
This step is but another made by
the present administration in Its ef
fort to bring about a more sanitary
condition in the dairies, soda foun
tains, grocery stores, restaurants, ho
tels and other places where food and
drink Is served to the public.
"Yc will secure Doctor Hammer as
chemist for the city," said Dr. S.
IioZell Hawley, superintendent of
health, yesterday in speaking of tho
progress his department is making in
the pure milk campaign which he in
augurated last week. "There Is a
great amount of work to be dono in
this line, and we are fortunate In se
curing such a competent man for the
place."
Doctor Hawley has secured other
samples of milk from restaurants and
dairy wagons, some which tho left
standing for a day have shown no
"cream line," while another samplo
shows sediment In the bottom of tho
bottle to tho thickness of u sixteenth
of nn inch and this in a quart bot
tle. "What would be the amount of
dirt and filth in a gallon of such
milk?" was Doctor Hawley's query.
For a number of years Doctor Ham
mer was in tho employe of the health
department of the city of New Or
leans, connected for the most part
with tho waterworks department.
With the experience gained there he
is expected to prove a great assist
ance to Commissioner C. S. Yottnk
mnn while the latter is busily on
giided In the construction of tho new
waterworks pumping plant and tho
laying of the new mains.
A laboratory Is lo be installed In a
room adjoining the orflce of tho city
superintendent of hralth In the city
hall, and all tests, many of which will
bo made secret until the final analy
sis has been secured, will bo carried

THE entiro line of the Alt river in

The southern and eastern drive In
tho Alt region has brought tho Teu

while to the south between Hochl De
Vede and Valenl their line has been
drawn considei ably nearer the Hu
manian capital. Alexandria, 47 miles
southeast of Kucharcst has been
taken by Field Marshal von Mack
enseu's troops.
Considei nig the swiftness of the
advance of the Teutonic allies thru
Wallachia, comparatively lew pris
oners have been taken, altho semi
official reports credit them with hav
ing captured considerable supplies of
needed stores. Near tirsova 2S offi

Tigvenl ten additional officers and
four hundred men fell Into tho hands
of the Teutons.
A Severe IM-rcat.

northeast of Monastir between
Trnovo and Makovu tho entente al

with u severe defeat thru tho fail
ure of an attack launched against the
lilies of the allies of the central

repulse of the Unitarians by the Serb

the Italians west of Munastlr, tho
entente allied war office record no

Practically every witness during the

In the absence of official advices on

sent an urgent telegram lo It. W. Kel

Humors of a contest of this nature
have been prevalent ever since the

hours have they proven to bo well
founded. One Vote liiixiiiunt.
The apparently close makeup of
the next house of representatives
places a national aspect on the con

'.f Chandler should bo unseated It
might mean that the Republicans
would lose control of tho house by
that one vote.
Wires were sent to and received
li'om men high In the party during

filed it will undoubtedly receive the
personal attention of some of the
