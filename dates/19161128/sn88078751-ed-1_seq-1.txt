Field Marshal Von M&ckensen's

Bulgarian territory to Zlmnitza ana

To tl: north, on the heights of
Gurtea-Dearges, in the region of
Dragoslaveie, northeast of Campu

Oituz tho Roumanians are offering
strong resistance to the southward ad
vance of tho Teutons. On all these
sectors attempts by the Austro-Uer
mans to advance have been held back
by the Roumanians.
As yet t'nern has been no Indication
of the arrival of Russian .reinforce

YTaUachian plains, but the Russo

that this reinforced army intended a

IMPORTS FROM
WARRING NATIONS
ttnsle Sam Would Ce Embarrass
ed If Supplies Were Gut Off.
New Yorlr, Nov. 27. Although it
would be possible for the United
States to exist without imports from
the nations now at war, this nation
would bo considerably embarrassed If
supplies from the belligerent coun
tries were cut off. This is the conclu
sion of tho nntional foreign trado
council in a roport on the results of
a special Investigation, which was
made public here today.
The report says: "Of 213 commodi
ties, each of an import value of more
than $1,000,600 in 1913, 121 were prin
cipally imported from nations of tiie
allied group (Including the British col
onies), while only 49 principally came
from tho central powers. In but 41
cases neutral countries were the
eource of principal 'supply. This al
lied superiority resulted from the
United States' extensive Importations
from the British colonies. The Unite.!
Kingdom (exclusive of the British col
OBiea) appears 46 times among the
count! los of principal supply and Ger
Jny 45 times."
Changes In such sources are possl
Wlltles resulting from the European
alliances, says the report. Increase!
cost of the supply of the msterlal
concerned In such changing, It is held,
may result If either or both the en
tente and central allied economic
groups seek to conserve their own
materials lor their own use.
The dependence of this country
upon the rest of the world for food
Ftuffs Is such that Interruption of blip
ply would not be seilous. Importa
tions are mostly In specialties. There
is no actual dependence for foodstufta
upon c-'ther allied group by this coun
try Tea and coffee are possible ex

but has been compelled to conflna It
self to partial attacks.
In tho Macedonian theater there
has been no infantry action except on
tho loft wing of the entente allied Hue,
where tho Italians "nave made further
progress toward Teinovn, near the
Monastlr-Presba Lake, road, according
to Paris. This statement, as regards
tlio gain, is contiadlcted by the Solia
war office, which says an Italian at
tack hero was repulsed and that the
attackers lost a large quantity of ma
erials. Sofia also denies a recent
French roport that tho French had
captured the town of Dobromlr, say
ing tho Bulgarians are fully iu control
there.
Tho French front is experiencing
another spell of inclement weather,
and excopt for small attacks at vari
ous points, little activity has been dis
played by either side.
Thoro has bpen consldorahle artil
lery firing along tne- eastern front at
various places from tho Riga region
to the Carpathians, with the Germans
the aggressors, and also on the Aus-tro-fta'iaii
front, with the Austrlans

El Paso, Tex., Nor. 27. Dispatches
from Chihuahua City state that a
small band of Villa bandits took a
foothold n the Church of Santa Rio
at Guadeiupe. They were driven out
by gun lire from their stronghold and
cavalry dlsperrd them.
The night was spent in expectatioo
of the last desperate attack, which
did not materialize. In the mornin?
small groups of enemy cavalry were
shelled by the artillery of Santa Ito3a.
hill.
Villa drove up in an automobile to
within about three miles of the city,
from the northwest. Tho automobile
was shelled by long-range guns, but
he escaped. The column of General
Maycotte, who has already left Santa
Rosaclia with 3,500 cavalry, is expect
ed to drive off the remaining bandits
No figures showing the casualties on
either side during the three days'
fighting is yet available.
High Mexican officials, who are at
Queretaro to altend the constitutional
convention, are still awaiting the full,
text of the border control protocol
signed in Atlantic City last week, and1
the full text or Secretary Lane's stat
ment defining in part the policy of thu
United States government toward
Mexico, before they will make any
comment on either.
There Is evidence, however, that
the news of the protocol and of Sec
retary Lane's statement has heen re
ceived by Mexicans with mixed feel
Ings. There Is seemingly satisfaction,
that an arrangement has been reacli
ed for the withdrawal of the Araerlcaa
troops from Mexico and for the con--trol
of the border, but this Is temper
ed by the feeling that Secretary
Lane's statement will require deea
consideration. The terms of the pro
tocol mentioning a delay of forty
days for the withdrawal of the troops,,
if conditions permit of such action. Is
adversely commented on In some
quarters, as many Influential men had
hoped for the immediate recali of the
troops to American territory.
It is known that certain Mexican
leaders have vigorously opposed any
agreement that would permit the pnr
sult Into Mexico of bandits by tha
American troops as outlined by Secro
tary Lane, it being stated that such
pursuit can only be regarded iu tho
ught of an Invasion. Other influenf
tial men, however, have made the deo
laration that the signing of the proto
cal is the beginning of an understand
ing that will wipe out cause for dis
agreement between the two countries.
