FLOUR MILLS
OF MINNESOTA
FACE EMBARGO
St Paul, Minn Nov 28 An em
bargo on Minnesota flour mills as a
result of the car shortage situation
was rated a possibility by state rail
road and warehouse commissioners
today. Southern Minnesota millers
are already complaining of condi
tions, the commissioners said, and
there is much congestion in the Min
neapolis terminal
Commissioner Jacobson staid that
large shipments of light wheat are
blamed by elevator men for the Min
neapolis condition. The explanation
is given, he said, that light wheat is
of necessity held in cars for the a
rival of heavier grades for mixing to
make receipts saleable to mills.
The shortage of grain cars In Mon
tana is* acute .according to reports re
ceived by the commission. The com
plaint is being made in that state that
railroad sidings in North and South
Dakota are lined with empty cars,
but Minnesota commissioners said
that control of that situation lies
in the Interstate Commerce commis
sion, if any regulatory body, and ad
ded that the federal commission is
asking for an act of congress to pro
vide it with authority to compel
compliance with an order for the re
turn of all cars to parent lines.
The Bemidji Pioneer is anxious to
publish all the local and society news
possible and would appreciate it very
much if anyone having news of that
character would phone 922, or mail
the details to the Bemidji Pioneer
office.
