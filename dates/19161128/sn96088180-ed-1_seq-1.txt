th American steamer Chemung, "by
torpedo and gunfire," was officially
reported to the state department this

Austrian submarine made the attack,
the American consul at Valencia

Although receipt of the cable plain
ly startled officials at first. It was later
pointed out that sine the Chemung
had contraband aboard she was sub
ject to visit and search at least by
an enemy of the country to which
the contraband waa destined.
, While no official statement was
forthcoming, it wss privately explain
ed that the slightest attempt at escape
from the submarine would have given
the submersible the right to lire on
her.
Tbts point, of course, must be con
clusively cleared np befor any de
cision can be reached. Soma officials
were frank to say that the United
States "of course" would take sum
mary action should It be proven the
attack was unwarranted. But, It was
repeated for sake of emphasis, the
facts, and all the facts, must be
known.
It Is understood here that the

ried pig Iron, 200 bales of cotton, cop
per wire and copper in pieces and
barrels. Copper has been declared
contraband by the entente allies.

Republicans frankly say they do
not believe everything can be
squeezed into the allotted space, and
they are willing that much shall hang
fire, since they argue they will have

Leaders estimated that about 13
weeks will be consumed ' In army,

"regular special" appropriation bills.
This will leave a scant month tor
other measures of wide importance.
If the supreme court erases the
Adamson bill from the statute books,
congress expects presentation of an
other eight-hour law. There are ad

rate, and the compulsory-lnvestlga-tlon-before-strlklng
