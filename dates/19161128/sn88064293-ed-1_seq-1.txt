It is absolutely impe. iblo to giv. you any idea of ti
quality, flavor ami richness of STONE'S "RICH FRUIT"
CAKE through the medium of paper and ink.
We could easily use a column in telling you about the
materials that go into it—Pineapples from Hawaii, Al
monds from Spain, Pecans from Texas, Cherries from
California, and so on through the list of twelve fruits that
are used —but what good does it do to name them over,
when the deliciousness is only half in the materials, the
otiier half being the art and skill with which they are
combined to make the perfect FRUIT CAKE.

IS THERE A SANTA CLAUS?
Many years ago, the late Frank P.
Church was an editorial writer on
the staff of the New York Sun. His
reply to a question from a little tot
"is there a Santa Claus?" has im
mortalized his name, for the En
glish language boasts of no prose
composition in which the romance of
childhood is so fittingly and beauti
fully expressed. It is regrettable that
we cannot publish the entire article
as written by Mr. Church at that
time but in the second and fourth
paragraphs of his tender response, .
the reader may find beauty of j
thought and expression that
characterizes but few of our present
day prose compositions. The para
graphs mentioned:
Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa
Claus. He exists as certainly as love
and generosity and devotion exists,
and you know that they abound
and give to your life its highest
beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary
would be the world if there were no
Santa Claus! It would be as dreary
as if there were no Virginias. There
would be no childlike faith, no
poetry, no romance to make toler
able existence, we should have no
enjoyment except in sense and
sight. The eternal light with which
childhood fills the world would be
extinguished.
"You may tear apart the baby's
rattle and see what makes the noise
inside, but there is a veil covering
the unseen world which not the
strongest man, nor even the united
strength of all the strongest men
that ever lived, could tear apart.
Only faith, fancy, poetry, love,
romance can push aside that curtain
and view and picture the super
natural beauty and giorv beyond. Is
j't a H real? Ah, Virginia, in all this
world there is nothing else real and
abiding."
To those who have not read the
complete editorial, there is but one j
bit of advrCe to give: read it; ponder I
over it; digest it! If you have reach-1
cd that station in life where love and;
youth and poetry and romance (
grate , upon your nerves, read the i
words of Mr. Church, not once, but j
twice, three times—aye, a hundred i
times, until you have immerged from
that state of lethargy in which all
men find themselves at some time or
other.
It is a splendid thing to practice
youth ocasionally; and there is no
better time in the whole year than
on December 25.
