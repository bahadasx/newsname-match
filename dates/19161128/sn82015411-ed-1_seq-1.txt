T DIORMI
The promoters of the idea of a
diorama of Waimea canyon at Ho
nolulu (mention of which has sev
eral times been made in these
columns, as well as in the August
meeting of the Chamber of Com
merce and in discussions of the old
committees of the Chamber) arc
still quite anxious that the project
be put through . Tho entire cost will
be only $500 to $550, which will in
clude the work of expert artists and
ctything else connected with the
(Hspiay. On account of the fact
that the Chamber was in a sort of
"transition period" at the October
meeting, with the old committees
out and the new committees not
yet settled down to business, the
subject was not touched upon then.
It now seems desirable, howeverj
that something be done prior to the
next meeting of the Chamber on
December 21, in order that the
artists to be detailed on the diorama
may have sufiicient time in which
to complete their work in a satis
factory manner.
This business belongs directly to
the exhibits commtttee of the
Chamber, which consists of the fol
lowing: .1. R. Myers, Kilauea;
chairman; A. I). Hills, Lihue; W.
K. Schultzc, Kekaha, and J. K.
Cockett, Koloa. The local promo
tion committee should also act with
the exhibits committee in the mat
ter, the former being: Wm. C.
Avery, chairman, Lihue; E. W.
Carden, Lihue; Capt. Geo. B. Lea-
vitt, Eleele, and J. M. Kaneakua,
Kealia. A third committee direct -Ju.
interested is the one on tourists,
