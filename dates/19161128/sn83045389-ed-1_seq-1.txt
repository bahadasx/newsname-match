proposed license tax on purchases, if
to he made effective for this year, to
lie a violent legislative wrench. He
said that the way to meet a deficit in

>amuel If. Jfeller. representing the
grocers, told the committee that he
stood where he did last summer, when
h<- contended for the 50-cent tax oil
' a pi t a I, with the addition of 1 mill on
all real estate and tangible personal
property.
Members of the committee listened
attentively to what was said before
going into executive session to consider
tiie various scales which were, from
time to time, suggested by different
merchants affected. It was finally de
cide.) that the scale chosen was the
best suited to all purposes, dividing as
equally as possible the tax upon the
small merchant, whose frequent turn
over of slock necessitates renewals a
dozen fir so times a year, as well as
upon the big dealers, who probably
restores his stock only once a year.
The action of the Finance Commit
tee was not so hasty as may appear
at first blush. Last summer the com
mittee reported to the Council for
adoption a license tax on purchases at
the lime Judge Richardson, of the
Hustings Court, held that the city
could not impose a tax in excess of
30 cents on merchants' capital, the
same rate which is applied to manu
facturers. At that time it was pointed
out to the committee that the city
hud appealed t < > the Supreme Court
from this decision, and that it was
likely that the lower court would be
reversed. Such was not the case, the
appellate tribunal last week sustaining
Judge Richardson. The whole question
had been thoroughly discussed from all
angles before the committee, and it
was simply holding the matter in abey
ance pending the result of the case in
the upper court. When this opinion
was handed down the committee was
prepared to take up the matter whee
it left off. The only difference In the
ordinance now forwarded for adoptio-t
is that of the rate imposed upon pur
chases.

should the ordinance be made a law
this week, will have their hands full
in seeing that its provisions are com
plied with by merchants for the cur
rent year.
Many merchants have already paid
their 101'*. taxes of $|.fA on capital.
It the ordinance becomes effective. It
will be necessary to adjust their ac
counts with the city.
As the Supreme Court's decision af
fects taxes of Ifila, It remains to h.?
seen what the city will do in this
Instance. The rate of JMO having
been pronounced illegal, it is certain
that some merchants will call for -i
refund of the difference between this
sum and .1) cents. This is a question
which will engage the attention of the
committee when it is brought to an
Issue.

W ASI11N< IT' ?N, November 2".?An
other conl roversy to-tween the Ameri
j can government and the entente allies
: is in prospect as a result of tli" refusal
of the British government to grant
safe conduct to fount Tarnowskl. the
newly appointed Au.stro-HunRari.in am
' bassador to the I'nited States.
In the absence of official advice, of- '
ticials ??f the State Department could
not forecast the course this govern
ment is likely to pursue, Imi u was
evident that the unfavorable action of
the British Foreign Otlice on the notice
of the intention of the new ambassador
to cross the Atlantic to his post gave j
them an unpleasant surprise.
Aside from the belief that England
would not care to arouse adverse feel
ing in the I'nited States by interference
with the ancient and generally timiues
tionerl right of a neutral government
to receive, an ambassador or minister,
otlicials had counted upon Ureal Brit
ain's notion in the .Mason and Slldell
, case to prevent such an action as re
ported in to-day's.cable dispatch."
The fact is recognized that in pro
? testing against the removal of the Con
federate commissioners from the steoni
j ship Trent, the British government
was mainly concerned with the viola
tion of the protection afforded by the
British flag under which the Trent
sailed, and it is said that it was on
that account the I'nited States repudi
ated the action of its naval commander,
: but it is held here that the protest
also was based on the right of diplo
matic otlicers to make their way to
their posts in neutral countries without
molestation. It probably will he on
that basis that the matter of Count
Turnowski's interrupted mission will
he taken up with the allies, for it is
well understood that the l.ondon For
eign (Ulice is supported by France, Italy
and Russia in its action.

The State Department so far has not
made a formal request for a safe con
duct for the Austrian ambassador, hut
lias confined itself to a transmission
i of the request of the Austrian govern
ment for such a courtesy. Therefore,
it. Is probable that if the issue is to
be made up. it will be necessary for i
the I nited States now to make such a
request on its own account.
ttreat Britain's attitude, if adhered
i to, would prevent a new Turkish am
bassador and successors to Captains
Boy-Kd and Voti I'a pen, former naval
land military attaches of the German
embassy, from reaching t Uo United'
SI a t es.
Negotiations regarding a new Turk
ish ambassador are said to have been
under way for some lime. It is un
derstood. however, that the Herman '
government has no intention al this
time of sending new naval and tjiililarv
attaches, because of the belief Hint i

immediately wonIrl become subjects of
