RUMOR ALSO SAYS
SALAZAR IS HURT
Juarez, Mex., Nov. 27.—The final re
sult of the fighting between the de
facto government forces defending
Chihuahua City and Francisco Villa's
bandit army was unkonwn at the
American border early today. Wire
communication between Chihuahua
City and Juarez, broken presumably
by bandits Saturday, had not been re
stored. Carranza officials here ex
pressed the conviction that Villa's des
perate efforts to take the city had
been repulsed although the last news
received directly from the battle field
indicated that the bandits, during the
fighting Saturday, carried the conflict
Into the city proper where they were
finally ejected after heavy losses on
both sides.
An account of the fighting early Sat
urday from an Associated Press repre
sentative at Chihuahua City was de
livered by courier at Marfa, Texas,
last night.
This account stated that short range
fighting occurred Saturday in Zarco
•venue and that the bandits were final
ly driven out to the plains where they
were raked with machine gun and ar
tillery Are. The account also said that
an automobile In which Villa was di
recting the bandit attack was riddled
by the fire of the government troops
and the bandit leader was forced to
fiee on horseback.

Later advices received by Carranza
officials here from a station north of
Chihuahua City said that Jose Ynes
Salazar, Villa's second In command,
a, iJ,1 was seriously wounded Saturday.
American army officers at El Paso
received a report last night that Villa
released the prisoners In Chihuahua
prison before he was driven out of the
city. Carranx* officials Bald they had
received no such advices.

here announced today he had received
information from official sources that
'•:'l Villa had been completely driven away
from Chihuahua City and was retreat

TEUTONDIPLOMAT
REFUSED PERMIT
London, Nov. 27.—The foreign office
has sent Ambassador Page a note
definitely refusing to grant a safe con
duct to Count Adam Tarnowskt von
Tarnow, the new Austro-Hungarlan
ambassador to the United StateB.
The reason for the refusal may be
paraphrased as follows:
"Even If International law forbade
the refusal of such a safe conduct, the
actions of Austrian and German em
bassies and consulates abroad have
been so much in excess of regular dip*
lomatlc functions that the British gov
ernment feels Justified In withholding
its consent for such diplomats to trav
el to their posts."
MASKED ROBBERS
HOLD UP STOCKMEN
Clinton, Nov. 27.—Clinton police and
Northwestern railway detectives today
were without a clue to the identity of
the two masked men, who held up and
robbed four stockmen In the way car
of a Northwestern railway stock train
here Saturday night. En route to Chi
cago, the train was held In the Clinton
yards, awaiting orders. During the
absence of the crew, the pair of rob
bers entered the way car with drawn
revolvers. The four stockmen quick
ly complied with the order, "hold up
your bandB," and the robbere relieved
them of about |130 In cash and four
valuable watches. Warning their vic
tims not to sound an alarm, the high
waymen dropped from the car and dis
hppeared. Not until fifteen minutes
later as the train was about to start,
was the crew apprised of the holdup.

FAMINE PARADE IN
NEW YORK PLANNED
PEOPLE TAKING UNUSUAL MEAS
URES TO FORCE DOWN THE
COST OF LIVING.
New York, Nov. 27.—Cooperative ac
tion by American housewives to com
bat food speculators in an effort to re
duce the price of the necessaries of
life was indicated in the household
embargo on eggs inaugurated here to
day. The movement has the endorse
ment of the National Housewives'
league and of John J. Dillon, commis
sioner of foods and markets, and Jo
seph Hartigan, commissioner of
weights and measures, representing
the city. Wholesale and retail dealers
also have given the proposal their ap
proval as the only practical method of
defeating the speculators.
This embargo is said to be the first
one of its kind which has had the sup
port. of dealers. In fact, It is stated
that it was suggested by a representa
tive of one of the largest grocery
firms in the city.
Representatives from several social
istic organizations and consumers'
leagues today announced plans for a
"famine" parade. According to the an
nouncement 100,000 men and women
have pledged themselves to advance
upon the city hall on December 9 and
demand that the mayor do all in his
power to "give them the right to con
tinue In existence."
GRAIN PRICE FALLS
Sensational Break Develops In Morn
ing Hours At Chicago Market
Embargo Feared,
Chicago, Nov. 27. —Wheat prices
came down today with a crash, break
ing in some cases as much as 9%c a
bushel. Big sales by some of the lead
ing houses started a general move-'
ment to unload holdings, and gave an
opening for aggressive selling by the
bears. Talk of the likelihood of an
armistice in Europe had considerable
to do with weakening the market, and
so also had warnings of the presence
of a fighting submarine In the Atlantic.
Continued reference to a possible em
bargo by the United States was like
wise a factor.
July wheat in which the greatest de
cline took place fell to 1.46 as com
pared with 1.54% to 1.54% at the fin
ish Saturday.
SUFF LEADER DIES
Inez Mllholland Boissevain la Victim
Of Dlseass After Long And Des
perate Fight.
Los Angeles, Cal., Nov. 27. —Mrs.
Inez Milholland Boissevaln, the noted
suffrage leader, died shortly before
midnight last night
Mrs. Boissevain had been ill in a
local hospital for ten weeks, suffering
from pernicious anaemia.
Every effort was made to save the
life of the patient, transfusion of
blood having been resorted to at least
seven times. She seemed to receive
temporary help from them, but It was
known by hor physicians that she
could not recover. Her husband was
with her at the end, as well as her par
ents and sister.
Her breakdown was attributed to
strenuous work in the cause of suf
frage during the recent presidential
campaign. She was about thirty years
old and famed for her beauty.
Mrs. Boissevain was widely known
for her activity as a suffragist, social
welfare worker, advocate of socialism,
and as a practicing lawyer. She was
a graduate of Vassar college.
ADOPTED GIRL TO
GIVE UP LEGACY
Amboy, 111., Nov. 27.—Nell, the broad
backed old mare, and the oprhan kit
tens on the Parkhurst farm near here,
are to have anew mistress soon unless
Mary Smith returns, James Parkhurst
announced today.
Mr. Parkhurst. who Is better known
as "Uncle Jimmy," is the wealthy farm
er who, with his wife, August 13. 1915.
adopted Mary Smith, a Chicago girl in
the early twenties with the understand
ing that she was to remain single and
act as their companion and upon their
death receive $10,000. But Mary tired
of her bargain and returned to Chicago.
Miss Mathilda Crowder of Kansas. 111.,
is being considered as her successor, it
is said.
Anonymous "poison pen" letters
which have been arriving at the farm
recently may have had a definite
weight in Mary Smith's decision to
leave and then there is the admission
from the girl herself and from Mr. and
Mrs. Parkhurst. that she didn't fit on
the lonely farm.
"Mary Smith wasn't the girl I should
have chosen for our home," Mrs. Park
hurst said today.

U-BOATS AGAIN
OFFU.S.COAST
Allied Skippers Are Anxious
About Safety of Their
Various Vessels
New York, Nov. 27.—Apprehension
is felt in shipping circles here in view
of the large number of passenger and
freight steamships nearing this port
and the reported proximity of German
submarines. Rumors of several days
to the effect that two German subma
rines have broken through the allied
cordon and were on their way to the
Atlantic coast received official recog
nition in the general warning sent out
list night by the British cruiser Lan
caster. The warship, stationed fifteen
miles southeast of Sandy Hook, cau
tioned all steamships flying the flags
of the entente allies to beware of hos
tile sub-sea boats on this side of the
Atlantic. The British wireless reads:
"German submarines may be met
anywhere in the Atlantic, especially
west of sixty degrees west. Show no
unnecessary lights. Avoid ail trade
routes and converging points."
Skippers Uneasy.
Not since the U-53 entered Newport
harbor October 7, and on the following
day sank several British merchant
vessels has there been so much uneasi
ness in marine quarters. It is believ
ed that the merchant vessels of the
allies now loading in this pbrt will not
venture out until the British govern
ment gives assurances ti^at the seas
are clear and the danger remote.
Among the steamships belonging to
the allied countries due to arrive this
week are the Cunard line steamers
Laconia and Pannonia, with passen
gers from Liverpool and London, re
spectively the Anchor liner Tuscania,
from Glasgow the White Star liner
Lapland from Liverpool the Duca d'
Acosta from Genoa and the Bermudian
from Bermuda. The freighters due
include the Celtic and Bovic of the
White Star line.
Almost a score of French and Brit
ish merchantmen have sailed from this
port within the last two days and all
of these vessels are within the zone
which if supposed to be most dan
gerous.
Many Get Warning.
Six steamships arriving here today
from European and West Indian ports
reported they caught wireless warn
ings yesterday to keep a watch for
belligerent submarines but all brought
word that no craft of that type had
been observed. The incoming vessels
took such precautions as shrouding
the lights during darkness and hav
ing the life boats swung out. The ar
rivals today included the American
liner Lapland from Liverpool, the
Italian ships Duca d' Acosta and Na
poli from Mediterranean ports, the
Danish vessel Frederik VIII. from
Scandinavian ports, the Brazos from
Porto Rico and the Bermudian from
Bermuda.
The Frederik VIII. put in at Kirk
wall, Scotland where the British
authorities removed the mails. She
brought here Roland Amundsen, ex
plorer of south polar regions, who said
he came on a private mission Lieut.
Asger Eranjean of the Danish army,
who plans to purchase American aero
planes, and'Manuel Calderon, Cuban
minister to Norway.

War Summary
The Teutonic campaign against Ru
mania is developing rapidly, with a
converging drive on Bucharest from
three directions in progress.
The immediate threat to the capital
seems to be greatest on the south
west where the. Invaders have ap
proached to within fifty miles, after
Field Marshal von Mackensen had
forced a passage of the Danube at two
points and effected a Junction with the
armies of General von Falkenhayn,
which are pressing rapidly eastward
after having broken the Rumanian re
sistance on the lower Alt.
The rapid Teutonic advance south
east of Craiova turned the flank of the
Alt position as did the Danube cross
ings. These factors together with tho
continued pressure on the northern end
of the line also theoretically outflank
ed, have now resulted in the Rumanian
abandonment of the Alt line. Bucha
rest announces this today, reporting
also a Rumanian retirement a little to
the east of the Topolog river, a trib
utary of the Alt on the east. This re
treat apparently places the Important
town of Rimnik on the railroad from
Craiova to Hermannstadt, in General
von Falkenhayn's hands.
The threat on the north and north
west from the border passes east of
the Alt, is still being held in check by
the Russo-Rumanian troops and en
tente military writers say the Rus
sians are sending further forces to
help out the Rumanians defending the
more immediate menace further south.
Sofia today gives some details of tho
crossings of the Danube. The cross
ing at Zimnltza was made bj Bulgarian
troops who are said to have captured
a large quantity of grain in the town.
The Germans effected their crossing
near the mouth of the Alt, occupying
Islacz.
RUSSIANS DIG IN.
In Dobrudjia north of the Constanza
Tchernavoda line the Russian advance
appears to have come to a halt. The
Bulgarian war office announces that
the hostile forces which had been at
tacking have now entrenched before
the Bulgarian position.
Fighting on the Macedonian front
has been less general on account of
bad weather but continued progress for
the Italians, who are driving north
ward west of Monastir is reported by
Paris. Sofia declares the Italians were
repulsed in this region. A Bulgarian
counter attack northeast of Monastir
In the Cerna river region was repuls
ed. according to the French war of
fice.
Seemingly there is no disposition on
the part of either the British or the
French to attack in force In the Som
me region Just at present. Extremely
bad weather has been reported as pre
vailing on this front and such attacks
as Berlin has recorded apparently
have been local in character. London
today in its report on operations along
the Franco-Belgian front, ignores the
Somme and the Ancre regions, men
tioning only artillery activity in the
neighborhood of LaBassee to the north
of Arras.
DIPLOMATS LEAVE GREECE.
Berlin. Nov. 27, (by wireless to Say
ville.)—Advices from Sofia to the
Overseas News agency say that the
ministers of the central powers whose
departure from Greece was demanded
by the entente allies have arrived at
the Bulgarian port of Kavala.

SAYS RUMANIA
ISG00DT0LEA1IE
"Ottumwa Jockey Back From
Balkans Finds Home More
Attractive Than Ever
"The Balkans and especially Ru
mania are good places to leave Just
now, if you are to leave with a whole
skin" says Wm. Wiley, the well known
local Jockey, who for several years
past has been riding some of the
mounts of the crown prince and prime
minister of Rumania.
The Jauntiness of the Jockey was
quite the same as when he left here
last spring for the Balkan states, but
he looked quite tired and showed
signs of having lost considerable rest.
Mrs. Wiley returned with her husband
and they are now established in win
ter quarters In the McPherson avenue
home where each winter they live
while in Ottumwa.
The story that they know of warring
Europe would fill a library and is re
plete with all the horrors of the dire
conflict that has been waging so relent
lessly in Europe for more than two
years and for some months past in the
Balkans where the Wileys have been
living since April.
Home Never So Welcome.
The tired and worn look may be ac
counted for by the long and tiresome
trip homeward from the seat of the
most severe of the present conflicts in
the Balkans. To spend months of
sleepless nights In terror of aerial
bombardments is enough to give one a
haggard look and worse, is the state
ment of Mr. Wiley. The newly arrived
Ottumwans know whereof they speak
too, for they have experienced living
in a city while It was being bombard
ed, not once but often and they say
that never was the home coming
sweeter or the sight of Ottumwa more
welcome than this fall.
As was their custom for some years
past, Mr. and Mrs. Wiley left here last
spring for the Balkans. Upon receipt
of a telegraph from the prime minister
at Bucharest to sail, they packed their
belongings and left Ottumwa for New
York setting sail April 8. Arriving at
their destination without anything
more serious happening than being on
a boat that' was torpedoed and report
ed to their friends as lost, they made
their anxious friends aware that they
had not been lost and took up home
life at Bucharest where Mr. Wiley rode
at the races.
Prices Soar High.
They found living somewhat more
expensive than when they had left
that country some months before and
the cost gradually Increased until the
war broke out and then even at for
bidding prices, the supply was not of
ten adequate to meet the demand.
Some of the prices quoted by Mr.
Wiley make the present high cost of
living in this country seem like a bless
ing or a donation. He says
"For six months before the war
broke out, sugar was almost an un
known commodity. There was no flour
obtainable and lard was a rarity com
manding a price of $1.75 a pound when
you could buy it, but that was only oc
casionally. It was a privilege to even
get to buy it.
"The government controls all of tho
bakeries in Bucharest and the bread
is dealt out by the police or soldiers.
The price, while of course verv high,
is always uniform and kept within tho
reach of all. Money, such as it is. is
practically worthless The farmer
bringing in his produce Insists upon
silver which" Is scarce and gold is un
obtainable while the paper which
serves as legal tender. Is worth but
little.
Go Without Bread.
"There were 7.500 aliens interned
when the war broke out and among
these was included every baker in
Bucharest. As a result there was no
bread obtainable for three weeks. Tn
order to get anything you need to
such as bread or meat and even oil
and other necessities, one is Issued
tickets."
Continuing he said: "One is allowed
one pound of ment in seven days, but
do not understand me to say that you
get a pound of meat every seven davs.
It Is not always obtainable. Tobnrro
is high in price and rare. First grade
clgaret tobacco may be had now and
then but no cigars.
"One of the effects of the proclama
tion of war was the enforcement of
strict prohibition as to alcoholic
liquors.

LITTLE ITALY HAS
BLOODY FUED ON
Chicago, Nov. 27.—That factions in
Chicago's Little Italy are engaged in
a bloody war seemed apparent to the

DISEASE OF CATTLE
BREAKS OUT AGAIN
SHIPMENTS ARE HELD UP AT
SEVERAL PLACES PENDING
AN INVESTIGATION.
Chicago, Nov. 27.—Alarm over the
possibility of- a new outbreak of the
disastrous hoof and mouth disease
spread today and was reflected in em
bargo orders.
The Union Stock yards here declar
ed quarantine against all cattle, horses,
sheep and swine originating In Kan
sas, Missouri and Nebraska. A train
load of live stock was held up at Clin
ton, Iowa, for examination.
Dr. O. D. Dyson, state veterinarian
of Illinois, issued orders on the stock
yards of Chicago and East St. Louis
forbidding the shipment of any live
stock except for immediate slaughter.
This, it was explained, affects only a
small proportion of live stock custo
marily handfcd here. The animals af
fected are those not yet heavy enough
for slaughter and which are reshipped
from the yards to farms for further
feeding. At this time of year this traf
fic is said to be light.
At Kansas City the quarantine es
tablished Saturday night probably will
remain effective until Wednesday by
which time it will be known whether
suspected animals have contracted the
malady. Federal inspectors are at
work among Buspected herds.
QUARANTINE IMPOSED.
Kansas City. Mo., Nov. 27.—The tem
porary quarantine Imposed upon the
local stock yards Saturday night be
cause of suspected cases of foot and
mouth disease probably will remain in
effect until Wednesday. At that time
the effect of the virus on the inoculat
ed pigs and calves will determine pos
itively whether the cases are foot and
mouth disease, officials at the stock
yards announced today.
As a result of the quarantine there
was no trading In stockers and feed
ers today.
COLORADO OFFICIAL ACTS.
Denver, Colo., Nov. 27.—An embar
go against shipment of cattle, sheep
or swine into Colorado has been placed

Loaded Coal Cars In Motion Now
Held for Day*.
Chicago, Nov. 27.—A measure abol
ishing the reconsignment system in
the handling of freight cars and fixing
anew and graded standard of demur
rage charges will be proposed to the
Illinois public utilities commission, W.
L. O'Connell, chairman of the body,
announced today. The measure, he
said, will bring relief in the coal short
age situation by setting in motion
many cars of coal now standing in the
railroad yards of the city, "because it
will become too expensive to keep
them on sidings."
Eugene Block, an alderman, also an
nounced that he will introduce a reso
lution at today's council meeting call
ing upon the interstate commerce com
mission to hold an immediate hearing
in Chicago on the question of coal
shortage and the reconsignment sys
tem.
