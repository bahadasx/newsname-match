sailed, and It is said that It was on

Mil understood that the London for-

It was learned today that the state
department so far has not made a for

Austrian ambassador, but has eon
'med itself to a transmission of the
request of the Austrian government
'or men n courtesy Therefore, it Is

Considering the swiftness of the ad

semi-official reports credit them with
having captured considerable supplies
of needed steles. Near i irsova. of

met with a severe defeat through the

against the lines of the allies of the
central powers. Aside from reporio
of the repulse of the Bulgarian by
the Serbians and of continued
progress for the Italians west of
Monustir. the entente allied war of
fices record no IntDOTtent gains on
the Macedonian front
in the Cam la sector of the Austro
Itallan theater, and east of Gorilla,
the Austrians are vigorously shelling
the Italians. On the Itussli.n fronr
there has been considerable activity
by both the Russians and German
at various points.
Comparative calm prevails all along
the front in Prance, so far as infantry
engagements are concerned.
A Berlin semi-official dispatch says
there are indications that the entente
Lilies contemplate fresh offensives,
probably near Armentierea and east
of Arras, where heavy artillery bom
bardments are being carried out. and
also on the St, Mlhel salient, south
east of Verdun.
Another semi-official rilanatch from
Berlin quotes Constantinople advwss
to the effect that Aral rn the.

Washington, Nov. II American
bankers w, re warned by th, federal
reserve board today to avoid locking
up their funds h porchaatna treasur)
bills of foreign governments involving
long-term obligations While sp
elftcally disclaiming "any Intention of
reflecting upon the financial abillti ol
any nation. " the board advises all In
vestors to proceed with caution, and
formally announced to member bunks
of the federal reserve system thai
with the liquid funds which should be
aval labia to American merchants,
manufacturers and farmers In danger
of being; a' soibed for other purpose
it does n"t regard it In the interest
of the country at this time that they
invest In foreign treasury bllli of this
character."
The statement I regarded In offl
.j.,, ,v,.i ,,e of the most import
ant declarations by the board since Its
creation, officials would not discuss
the question for publication, but some
of them Informally interpreted the
warning as the reserve board' answer
to the recent proposal of J P. Morgan
& Co., British fiscal agents in this
country, to have American bankers
accept British treasury bills of an In
definite total issue, seemed by gold
reserves held in Ottawa Such loans
would be for ninety days, With the
privilege of renewal.
H. P. Davlsou of the Morgan firm.
Wa in Washington recently and con
ferred with President Wilson and
some of the memberi of the reserve
board. It was laid Lit . r that be
oultt to have the banks of the t
eWe system authorised lo buy Brit
ish treasur bills as if they were bills
of exchange to cover commercial
transactions.
Danger from further importation of
large amounts of gold, the board say-,
will arise only in ease the gold is pel
nutted to become the basis of and. sir
able loan expansions and of Inflation
Emphasis is laid upon the necessity
for caution m putting money into In
vestments which are short term In
name but which "either by contract
or through force of circumstan.es.'
may ill the aggregate, have to be re
newed Until normal conditions re
l urn."
The Board's Warning
The board's warning, In the form of
a Statement to be published later ill
the Federal Reserve Bulletin, follows
"In lew of cont i a 'll lory repot Is
which have appeared m the pi ess re
garding Its attitude toward the pnr
. basing by banks In this country of
treasury bills of forehm governments,
the hoard deems ii a duty to define its
position clearly. In making this state
men) the board desires to disclaim
any Intention Of discussing the fi
nances or of reflecting upon the
rinnnelnl stability of any nation, hut
wishes it understood thsl
deal onlv with genera
which affect all alike
"The board does not share the view
frequently expressed of late thai the
importations of large amounts of sold
must of necessity prove n source of
danger or dlsturbaw e to this country,
That danger, the board believes, Will
arise only in case the inflowing gold
should remain uncontrolled and be
permitted to become the basis of un
desirable loan expansions and of In
flation There are means, however,
of controlling accessions of gold b)
.proper and voluntary i'o-operatlon ol
the banks or if ne d be, by legislate
enactment. An important step In this
din ctlon won id he. ' he anticipation ol
the final transfer of the reserves con
templated by the federal reserve set
to become effeOtlVS on November H,
1917. This date .an be advanced to
February or March, lot 7.
"Member banks would then be
placed on the permanent basis of thi it
reserve requirements and fictitious re
serves then would disappear and the
banks have a clearer conception of
actual reserve and financial condi
tions, it then will appear that, while
;i large increase in the country's gold
holdings has taken place, the expafl
nion of loans and deposits have been
such that there will not remain any
excess ,if reserves, apart from the Im
portant reserve loaning pawer of the
f, defal r, s. rc banks
An i ce-s of Reserves,
"In these circumstances the hoard
feels that member banks should pur
ue a policy of keeping themselves
liquid; of not loaning down to the
legal limit, but of maintaining sn
CeSf of reserves not with reserve
agents, win re their balances ale loan
ed out and constitute no actual re
serve but in their own vaults oi pref
erably With their federal reserve
banks The board boUOVOS that at this
time bank- should proceed with much
caution In locking up thi Ir funds in
long time obligations, or In Invest
ments which are short term In form
or name, but which, either by con
tract or through force of circum
stances, may, In the aggregate, hsve
lo be renewed until normal conditions
return. . ,
"The board does not undertake lo
forecast probabilities or to specify cir
cumstances whi. h may he become Im
portant factors in determining future
conditions. Its concern and responsi
bility liea primarily with the bin, kins:
situation. If. however, our banking
