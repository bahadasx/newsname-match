Virtue
Virtue is a flower Immortal,
It will not wither or decay;
And will last long, long after
This old earth has passed away.
Beauty is a fading blossom
It can perish in a day.
Sparkling wit grows dull and
tarnished
Long before our hair turns grey.
Wealth has wings and mirth has
sorrow
Only waiting down the road.
Then we had better stick to virtue
Though it be a heavy load.
Power has weakness only waiting
For old age to make display;
Honors melt like winter snowflakes
Which warm sunbeams chase away.
Love may languish and grow tired.
Graceful movements will not stay
But old virtue still is lasting
Beautiful in that eternal day.
Susanne Hale
