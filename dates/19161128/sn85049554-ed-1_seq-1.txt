TWO IMPORTANT
TOWNS CAPTURED
:x:
Two Important announcements
are made by Berlin today in re
porting continued progress of the
Teutonic invasion of Roumania—
the captura of Giurgiu, on the
Danube, and the taking of Curtea
deArgea. on the Argeohu river,
eighty miles northwest of the capi
tal.
The capture of Glurglu places
Field Marshal von Mackensen's
army advancing from the
southwest, only thirty-seven
miles from Bucharest, with
a railroad running thence, along
which the advance may be pressed.
In occupying Curtea da Arges,
General von Falkenhayn's troops
apparently have driven the Rou
manians from the line of the Topo
log and may even have broken,
near its northern end, the line• of
the Argechu, along which the Rou
manians were expected to make a
decisive stand.
Thus the semi-circle about Bu
charest and the Roumanian armies
'./• is gradually but steadily being
drawn closer. Substantial suc
cesses are reported by Berlin in
the new operations for tightening
*, .the grip.

away from home?" he was asked
"Right at 8 o'clock" he answered I
"Had you made any arrangements the

iotfk. He said they were

erve what way they
came from into Sciola the second time?"
he was questioned.
"From the north," he answered. He
also'stated that Mr. Shipper lived north

Mra. wTillard Discredited.
Dr. C. E. Crowe, of Villisca, was
the first witness to be asked concern
ing Mrs. Alice Willard's reputation.
Dr. Crowe is an osteopath in Villisca
and formerly a newspaper man, be
ing connuected at one time with the
Villisca Letter.
"Are you acquainted with Alice
Willard!" Mr. Crowe was asked.
"Yes, sir," was the answer.
"You may state whether or not you
know her general reputation in Vil
lisca as to her general moral charac
ter."
"Yes," answered Crowe.
"Is it good or bad?" he was asked.
"Bad," responded the witness.
"How's yours?" was the first ques
tion with which Attorney Mitchell
came at Dr. Oowe in his cross ex
amination. A lively argument ensued
betweeij Crowe and Mitchell, in which
Attorney Beeson called upon Judge
Ro^kafellow to restrain Mr. Mitchell
from commenting on the witness'
answers. Crowe said he'd be foolish
if he didn't think his own reputation
good.
When Wllkerson's counsel asked if
he could tell the moral character of
any man or woman Attorney Beeson
interposed an objection, stating that
Crowe had not been asked in his direct
examination about moral character
but about reputation.
"Tell me sir," continued Mr.
Mitchell, "what man or woman ever
told you that Mrs. Willard had a bad
reputation." The witness did not
answer and after an objection from
Beesoq was overruled. Mitchell ex
•cusedt /the ^swtiWas-Trtttr the^cOmmfent,
"Welli "doctor, I'm' afraid your pa
tients will all die."
George Winters,' who followed
Crowe on Uie stand, was also asked
of Mrs. Willard's reputation. 'Is It
good or bad?" was the question.
"Bad," he answered.-'
Mitchell also began his cross ex
amination of Winters with the ques
tion, "How's yours!"
Winters came back with the re
remark, "In tny opinion mine Is good."
"Tell me one man or woman you
ever heard say the general reputation
or character of Mrs. Willard was bad,"
asked Mr. (Mitchell. Winters replied
with several names.
"What church do you belong to?"
asked Mitchell.
"I profess, to belong to the Methodis't
church," responded Winters. Winters
said he didn't think there was a great
deal of difference between reputation
and moral character.
Aged Man on Stand.
W. D. Reynolds, 76-year-old resident
of Villisca, said he knew Mrs. Willard
when he saw her and was familiar with
the location of the home of her father,
Mr. Holland, where she lived with ref
erence to the Joe Moore home. Reyn
olds said he made an experiment from
the Holland property and couldn't sec
any of the Joe ^loore home from there
except part of the chimney.
When Mr. Mitchell suggested on
cros^k examination that Mr. Reynolds
didnT have good eyesight he met with
an. emphatic denial. He said de didn't
make his experiment from where Mrs.
Willard said she stood when she testi
fied she had seen the two strangers go
by the Moore home.
J. W. Wickersham.a traveling grocery
salesman of Red Oak, was also asked
about Mrs. Willard.' He said her gen
eral reputation was bad. On cross ex
emlnatlon Wickersham said he didn't
belong to Mr. Jones' church but had
talked with Mr. Jones about this case
several times. .He declared he had
heard something about Mrs. Willard's
character ten years ago. He denied he
felt bitter against witnesses Who had
testified for Wilkerson and also that
he had been devoting lots of time in
the aid of Senator Jones.
Tom Woodward, of Villisca, also aald
he had made an experiment of the
possibility of vision between the home
of'Mrs. Willard and the Moore house.
He said that only a corner of the
Moore home could be seen.
"Could you see persons passing on
the sidewalks?" he was asked.
"No sir," he answered.
Woodward also said that he could
not remember of there being any brush
or small trees growing on the north
of the Joe Moore lot at the time of the
murder.
On cross examination, Wllkerson's
attorney sought to bring out Mr.
Woodward's interest in the growth of
weeds on the streets and lots of Vil
lisca. Mr. Mitchell brought out the
fact that Woodward's experiment was
made in conjunction with Mr. Reynolds
and it was made from an automobile
and not from Mrs. Willard's porch.
Woman Va, Woman.
Mrs. M. Cowglll, wife of /Captain
Cowgill of Villisca, was the last wit
ness on the stand in the afternoon.
"Are you acquainted with Mrs. Alice
Willard?" she was asked.

London, Nov. 2S,—Two Zeppelins,
which raided the northeast coast and
the north mldlan*} counties during tho
night were brought down and destroyed
by British airmen and it is understood

Thla makes a total of seven German
airships destroyed in England the pres
ent year, while six have been brought
down in other fields of operation.
The two months of immunity which
Groat Britain has had from hostile air
raids led many persons to believe tbo
Germans would not risk any more air
ships tn attacks which, while causing
numerous casualties among civilians
and damage to private property, wero
said in England to have gained no mil
itary advantage for them.
The authorities, regarding the proiee
tlon of London as fairly complete, con
tinued their work with the/object of
rendering other parts of the country
safe. The success of the air patrols
this morning has given tbe greatest
satisfaction here.
