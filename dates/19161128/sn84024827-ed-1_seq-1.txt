Pay More Attention to Needs of Merchants and Farmers at
Home, and Keep Big Actual Reserve on Hand and in Re
serve Branches, for Loans Abroad May Be Uncertain and
Hard to Collect, Is Important Statement of Board.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 27. American bankers were warned by the fed
eral reserve board today to avoid loc king up their funds by purchasing
treasury bills of foreign governments involving long term obligations..
While specifically disclaiming "any Intention of reflecting upon the
financial stability of any nation." the board advises all investors to pro
ceed with caution and formally annou need to member banks of the federal
reserve system that with the liquid funds which should be available for
manufacturers and farmers in danger of being absorbed for other purposes,
. it "does not regard it in the interest of the country at this time that they
invest in foreign treasury bills of this character."
The statement is regarded in offi cial circles as one of the most im
portant declarations by the board sin ce its creation. Officials would not
discuss the question.
Moraan Plan Rejected
H. P. Davison of the Morgan firm,
was in Washington recently and con
ferred with President Wilson and
Borne of the members of the reserve
board. It was said later that he had
sought to have banks of the reserve
system authorized to buy their treas
ury bills as if they were bills of ex
change to cover commercial transac
tions. U. 8. Don't Fear Gold
Danger from further Importation of
large amounts of gold, the board says,
will arise only In case the gold Is per
mitted to become the basis of unde
sirable loan expansions and of infla
tion. Emphasis is laid on the neces
sity for caution in putting money into
investments which are short-term in
name but which "either by contract
or through force of circumstance may
in the aggregate have to be renewed
until normal conditions return." '
The board's warning. In the form of
a statement to be published later in
the Editorial Reserve Bulletin, fol
lows: No Slap At Allies Aimed
"In view of contradictory reports
which have appeared in the press re
garding its attitude toward the pur
chasing by banks In this country or
treasury bills of foreign governments,
the board deems it a duty to define
its position clearly. In making this
statement the board desires to dis
claim any intention of discussing the
finances or of reflecting upon the fi
nancial stability of any nation, but
wishes it understood that it seeks to
deal only with general principles
which affect all alike.
Advice to Banks
"The board does not share the view
frequently expressed of late that fur
ther importations of large amounts
of gold must of necessity prove a
source of danger or disturbance to
this country. This would arise only
in case the inflow of gold is uncon
trolled and permitted to become the
basis of undesirable loan expansions
and of Inflation. There are means,
however, or controlling accessions of
gold by proper and voluntary cooper
ation of the banks or if need be by
legislative enactment. An Important
step in this direction would be the
anticipation of the final transfer of
reserves contemplated by the federal
reserve act to become effective on
November 16. 1917. This date can be
advanced to February or March, 1917.
"Member banks would then be plac
ed on the permanent basis of their
reserve requirements and fictitious re
serves then would disappear and the
banks have a clearer conception of
actual reserve and financial condi
tions. It then will appear that while
a large increase in the country's
holdings has taken place, the expan
sion of loans and deposits has been
such that there will not remain any
excess of reserves, apart from the
important reserve loaning power of
the federal reserve banks.
Keep Banks Liquid
"In these circumstances the board
feels that member banks should pur
sue a policy of keeping themselvef
liquid: of not loaning down to the le
gal limit, but ot maintaining an ex
cess of reserves not wtyh agents
where their balances are loaned out
and constitute no actual reserve, but
in their own vaults or preferably with
federal reserve banks. The board be
lieves that at this time banks should
LOANS BY
RESERVE
proceed with much caution in locking
up their funds in long term obliga
tions or in Investments which are
short term in form or name but which
either by contract or through force ot
circumstances may in the aggregate
have to be renewed until normal con
ditions return.
Future Uncertain
"The board does not undertake to
forecast the probabilities or to speciry
circumstances which may become Im
portant factors In determining future
conditions. Its concern and respon
sibility lies primarily with the banks.
If. however, our banking Institutions
have to intervene because the gener
al securities accumulate faster than
they can be absorbed., an element
would be introduced into the situa
tion which, if not kept under control,
would tend toward instability or ul
;,,, tninrv tn the economic devel-
j opraent of this country.
"The natural absorption power of
the investment market supplies an
important regulator of the volume of
our sales to foreign countries tn ex
cess of the goods they send us. The
form which the most recent business
is taking, apart from reference to its
intrinsic merits, makes it appear par
ticularly attractive as a banking in
vestment. The board, as a matter of
,fact, understands that it is expected
to place it primarily with banks, in
fact it would appear so attractive that
unless a broader and national point
of view be adopted, individual banks
might easily be tempted to invest in
It to such an extent that banking re
sources of this country employed In
this manner might run into many
hundreds of millions of dollars.
"It would therefore seem as a cir
cumstance, that liquid funds of our
banks, which should be available for
short credit facilities to our merch
ants, manufacturers and farmers.
would be exposed to the danger of be
ing absorbed for other purposes to a
disproportionate degree, especially in
view of the fact that many ot our
banks and trust companies already
are carrying substantial amounts of
foreign obligations and of acceptances
which they are under agreement to re
new.
"The board deems it therefore its
duty to inform banks that It does not
regard it In the interest of the coun
try at this time that they invest in
foreign treasury bills of this charac
ter. "The board does not consider that
t is called upon to advise private in
vestors, but as the United Stales Ip

LONDON, Nov. 27. The foreign office has sent a note definitely refus

The reason for the refusal may be paraphrased as follows:
"Even or international law forbade the refusal of such a safe conduct,
the actions or Austrian and German embassies and consulate! abroad have
been so much in excess of regular diplomatic functions that the British gov
ernment feels justified In withholding Its consent for such diplomats to
travel to their posts."

BUYS AEROPLANE TO

(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK. Nov. 27. To soar ov

the ambition of Roald Amundsen, the
Norwegian explorer, who discovered
the South Pole. Captain Amundsen
arrived here today from Copenhagen
to purchase two hydroplanes for that
purpose. Starting in the summer of
191S. he .said he expects to be in the
far north rrom two to five years. The
main object or his flight. Captain
Amundsen declared, would be to study
the air currents around the pole.
"The ship will follow the coast of
Siberia until the Ice breaks up and
then drift toward the pole." said Cap
tain Amundsen. "The drift should
take us to a point somewhere between
Spitsbergen and Greenland, after we
have made an almost complete circle
of the top of the globe. I hope to be
within 100 miles of the pole, or 150
t the furthest, when I leave the ship,
then will follow the dash by hydro
plane." HEARTBROKEN WIFE OF

I FOR AUSTRIAN
CA
In the absence of official advices
cn the subject officials of the stata
department were not in a position to
day to discuss it formally or 10 fore
cast the course the government is
likely to pursue. It was made evident
however, that the unfavorable action
of the British foreign office on the
notice of the intention of the new am
bassador to cross the Atlantic to his
post came as an unpleasant surprise.
It had not been doubted here that
; Cr)ai. rtritain would be the last power
to dny the privileged character of a
diplomntic officer on such a voyage.
Custom of Centuries
Aside from the belief that England
would not desire to arouse adverse
feeling in the United States by Inter
ference with the ancient and general
ly unquestioned right or a neutral
government to receive an ambassador
or minister, officials had counted up
on Great Britain's record in the Mas
on and Slidell case to prevent such
an action as reported in today's cable
dispatches.
The fact Is recognized that in pro
testing against the removal of the
Confederate commissioners from the
steamship Trent, the British govern
ment was mainly concernej with the
violation of the protection afforded
by the British flag under which the
Trent sailed and it was said that on
that account the United States repu
diated the action of its naval com
mander. It is held here that protest
also based on the right of diplomatic

to the attention of the British govern
ment. May Be No Protest
It was learned today that the state
department so far has not made a for
mal request for a safe conduct for the
Austrian ambassador but has confined
itself to a transmission of the request
or the Austrian government for such
a courtesy. Therefore it is probable
that if the Issue is to be made it will
not be necessary for the United States
i to make such a request on its own ac
count.

Negotiations regarding a new Turk

under way for some time. It is un
derstood, however, that the German

time of sending new naval and mili
tary attaches, because of the belief
that upon their arrival in thi9 country
they would beco-ce subjects cf suspi
