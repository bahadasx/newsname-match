(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Headquarters of General von Falk­
enhayn in tjie Transylvanian Alps,
NOT. 28, via Berlin and 'Sayvilla wire
less.—-"Our task is to destroy the Rou­
manian army and that we are doing
as best we can."
So spoke Gen. Falkenhayn today,
bis brows wrinkled, but his eyes
sparkling as be submitted to ques­
tions concerning the victorious prog­
ress of his troops against Roumania.
"Our flyers," he continued, "report
the Roumanian roads blocked with
people and wagons bearing refugees'
fleeing from Little Wallachia toward
the Alt river. That is the terrible*
part of war.. That soldiers should
suffer is war, but that women and
children should be put to such misery
—that is terrible. But it was Rou­
manian choice. Roumijnia played
with fire too long—and is now getting
burned.'""
"How soon do you expect to get to
Bucharest?" the German general was
asked.
"We want Bucharest,' he respond­
ed immediately. "Every time we take
charge of. a city we have to feed the
population. We are not bothered by
that question. We are soldiers. Our
task is to destroy the Roumanian
army and that we are doing as best
we can."
"May 1 ask another question, excel­
lency?" 1 ventured.
The general's brows moved up and
down and his eyes looked out sharp­
ly as only von F&lkenbayn's .eye# can
do. He nodded a«s«it.* •v'"f
"When will the Roumanian army
be destroyed?* I '.asked.'
An officer standing nearby smiled.
But Falkenhayn looked'straight at his
questioner, atj/'-hife VetiHedr
"Rain or railway accident,
or almost aftytllirig can destroy the
be§t made plans. I Have been In tbis
war two and a half years and can
say the only' certain thing about it is
—uncertainty. I am only certain of
one thing—and that is, that we will
win."
Seated across from his excellency
was his chief of staff. Turning next
to him for comment on the Rouman­
ian operations about Craoiva, be re­
sponded:
"In the warfare here the cavalry
goes forward like a snake over new
territory—with its fangs out and wav­
ing in the air. When those fangs en­
counter an obstacle they are drawn
lato the snake's mouth. Then after
a while the fangs reappear and the
snake continues."
Officers defctare It will be interest­
ing to See whfct, tile Roumanians de­
cide to do, vflii^ther they will fight or
surrender.
Reports reaching von Falkenhayn's
headquarters today indicated that
German operations are progressing
splendidly. It is believed the Rou­
manians will be obliged to choose a
new line, as far 1»ack as the Alt river,
protecting valuable stores, most of
which are owned by England.

Fargo Member of Supreme Court
Notes Precedent To Establish
His Claims
The suureme court of North Dakota
may havb three justice" loo many
next Monday.
On that date the justices-elect nam­
ed at tho recent general election: J.
E. Robinson, R. H. Grace and Lucher
E. Birdzell, plan to come to Bismarck
to claim their seats on the supreme
bench. On that same date the re­
tiring justices—C. J. Fisk, E. T. Burke
and E. B. Goss—will be sitting. The
former will' Contend that their six
years' terms date from the first Mon­
day in December: the latter claim
they were elected for six years from
the first day of January, 1910, and
that their terms do not expire until
the 31st day of December.
Old Provision Dug Up.
There is involved principle, prece­
dent and one month's -salary, amount
ing to $416 and some cents.
In support of their contention, the
justices-£lect quote section 92 of tho
state ^Constitution, which provides that
justices of the supreme court shall
serve from the first Monday in DC
cember following their election
The retiring justices assert that
this provision was embodied in the
constitution as an emergency meas­
ure. wfcen the state -flaw admitted i»
and as means of assuring that
tjhe: state, would not remain two
two months without a supreme court
after the general election was held
tha| fall.
Justices Fisk, Burke and Goss con
tend there is nothing in established
precedent or custom which would
warrant the step contemplated by the
justices-elect. The justices-elect,
claim there is, and their position is
stated in the following letter from J.
E. Robinson:
"Charles J. Fisk,
"Bismarck, N. D.
"Dear Judge:
"Your favor regarding the time for
the next supreme court judges to

"You claim that by custom and
statute, the time is the first Monday
in January. We claim it is the first
Monday in December, and that it is
controlled by the constitution, which
fixes the latter date.
Wallin Served From December.

took office for seven years, and then
for six years, and his second term

"Judge Cochrane was elected'as the
successor of Judge Wallin. They were
bosom friends, and Judge Wallin may
have served a month on the term of
Judge Cochrane.
"When Judges Burke and Goss were
elected, I think they were each on the
district bench, and it is possible that
they had some business to detain
them. But, of course, the fact that
a judge does not choose to qualify
on the day his term of office com­
mences, does not lengthen out his

regard to the supreme court judges,

URGES FEME
New Yprk, .ov. 2S.—A prominent
banker emphatically denied here to­
day that Wall Street is behind the
present peace talk in America. He
said financiers of Europe could not
prevent the war, and, of course, finan­
cial men of America would be fool­
ish to think that they could stop it.
The banker continues:
"If we were worried about loans pil­
ing up and that we worried about the
loans falling off. then the loans would
end automatically, if unattractive
from a business standpoint.J That is
the cold blooded financial view of it.
Personally, I don't believe that there
is a banker in thfe United States who
would not like to see the war end to­
morrow. That is the liuman, not the
business side.
"What' could we do to stop the war*
"Stop lending money?
"Germany is not borrower, yet
she continues to fight on her own re­
sources. The Allies have enormous
funds. They have been fighting on
borrowed money# while they conserv­
ed their own finances.
'It is unlikely that the peace move­
ment will be successful at this time,
but it is untrue that Wall Street is
having any effect upon peace efforts."
