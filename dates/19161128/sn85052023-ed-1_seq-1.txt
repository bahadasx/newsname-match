STATE-WIDE OR NOT
IS THE BIG ISSUE IN KENTUCKY
POLITICS FROM NOW ON
Question Coining To Vote Soon And
Leaders Who Have Been On
"Wet" End Are Up In Air
The question of submission of the
state wide prohibition amendment to
the constitution of Kentucky, is the
sole subject of discussion by the po
litical writers of the daily papers
nowadays. The action of the Louis
ville Times in demanding submission
as soon as possible has stirred up a
Tiornet's nest among the whisky ele
ment, and especially among these
leaders of the democratic party who
have always taken the wet side in
politics. The Times claims to be actu
ated in its suggestion solely by a de
sire to get this matter out of poli
tics. The Interior Journal and other
papers which have stood for temper
ance and state-wide for years, have
urged all along that the liquor ques
tion would be the biggest thing in ev
ery political race until it was settled
finally by vote of the people, and the
Times at last seems to be coming
around to the view that the real tem
perance papers out in the state, have
maintained for years.
Anyway the "big fellows" are stir
red up over the matter, and from now
on it's to be a wet or dry fight, with
the wets seeking to obtain every ad
vantage to prevent state-wide from
carrying when it comes to a vote
which is assuredly soon and certain.
The Louisville Post told Monday of a
conference of prominent democrats
held in that city Saturday and Sun
day, as follows:
Two conferences were held in Lou
isville Saturday and Sunday for the
purpose of considering plans to check
the growth of the State-wide prohibi
tion movement in Kentucky and it is
understood that considerable differ
ence of opinion manifested itself at
the conferences.
The first meeting was held late
Saturday afternoon at the Seelbach
Hotel and was made up exclusively of
men engaged in the beer and whisky
business. Mr. John Klaecker, a brew
er of Newport, Mr. Chas. M. Lewis,
of Washington, and Mr. Lawrence
IReichert, of Louisville, were the most
pi-ominent men at this conference, al
though others were present.
The second conference was held
Sunday morning at the Seelbach and
was made up of Democratic politicians
who have been allied with the liquor
interests in most of their fights. Sen
ator O'lie M. James and Governor A.
O. Ft: '.ley were the leading partici-pa:;.-
i - this conference. Various Fed
en;! office holders, who secured their
places upon recommendation of Mr.
James, were present, as were Judge
Chas. Hardin, the chairman of the
Democratic Committee, and others of
the James-Stanley faction. The liquor
men remained about the hotel while
this second conference was in prog
ress and messages were passed back
and forth.
After the conference various of
the followers of Mr. James and Mr.
Stanley, who were not admitted to
the meeting of the Senator and the
Governor and their friends, were told
that no definite decision had been
reached in regard to a policy for
fighting the State-wide movement. It
was given out that the suggestion
that the Governor request the legisla
ture at the extra session in January
to submit a State-wide amendment
to be voted upon next November met
with much opposition. It was stated
that the leaders were informed that
the best legal advice obtainable was
that such an amendment cannot le
gally be permitted at an extra session
and all that would be accomplished
would be to strengthen the movement
to submit the amendment at the next
regular session which is to take place
a year from January.
Mr. Klaecker, the brewer from
Newport, is much opposed to the
whole plan, and it is predicted that
Senator James and Governor Stan
ley will side with him.
The atitudes of both the political
parties were anxiously discussed at
both meetings. The Democratic lea
gue for the submission of a State
wide amendment, of which Dr. A. J.
A. Alexander, of Woodford county,
is President, was admitted to be
growing rapidly in strength. On the
other hand all the leaders present
stated frankly their belief that the re
publican party in Kentucky is head
ed straight for the dry camp. That
'the Republcan members of the legis
lature will be nearly solid for the sub
mission of a State-wide amendment,
and that the bulk of the Republican,
vote will be cast for the ratification
of that amendment .when it. is sub
mitted is the belief of Governor Stan
ley and all of his associates.
Although much perturbed over the
whole situation, the brewers and dis
tillers are said to be satisfied with
the attitude of both Senator James
and Governor Stanley, and confident
that they can rely upon the support
of that faction in the fight that is
ahead. There was said, however, to
have been a strong disposition to side
track the Governor as much as pos
sible, and make Senator James the
leader of the anti-prohibition fight.
Democratic committees will be
elected Saturday of this week in ev
ery county of the State, and plans
were discussed at the Seelbach con
ferences for these fights. It was stat
ed that Dr. Alexander's association
is hard at work on this proposition.

Weil Gets An Extra Fancy Load
From Knox In Boyle

GOOD MEETING CONTINUES
The meeting at the Baptist church
continues with unabated interest.
Large crowds attend each service
and frequently at nights chairs are
used in order to seat the crowds. The
sermons of Evangelist Bryan are
marvels of simplicity and sweetness
and the attention given them is
marked. The evangelist is proving
himself an able expounder of gospel
truths and a humble godly man, who
is calculated to do much good. Dr.
Early's remarks before and after
each sermon are most appropriate
and the good man is intensely inter
ested in the meeting and the wel
fare of his fellow geings. The meet
ing will continue each morning and
evening until further notice. There
have been nine additions to date.

Local Birds Win Honors
Lombardy Heighths Chickens Get the

prietor, almost swept the boards
clean in every class in which it had
entries at the Kentucky State Poul
try Show which was held at Rich
mond last week in connection with
the Madison County Agricultural
Show. This was perhaps the largest
poultry exhibition ever held in the
state, and the local birds went up
against prize winners from all over
this and neighboring states, and more
than demonstrated their superiority.
They won a total of 29 blues or
firsts; 19 seconds, six thirds and four
fourths, and in addition won the
four A. P. A. specials, for each class,
two silver cups, seven merchandise
specials and four cash specials. It
was a great show made by the Lom
bardy Heights birds and was a big
feather in the cap of Mr. Reid that
his birds could go up against the
extremely high class competition
which they met and come off with
first honors for such a show.
The poultry show was judged by
Judge H. A. Pickett, of Scott coun
ty, where he has been government
farm demonstrator for some time.

Big Fire At Irvine
Breaks Out Early In Morning and
Causes $250,000 Loss.
Fire originating in the City Res
taurant at Irvine, Estill county, at
1:30 o'clock Saturday morning de
stroyed an entire business block and
caused a loss of $250,000. When dis
covered the fire hnd o-ninod snph
way that it could not be checked,
ana spread rapidly until only charred
embers remained. The fire is sup
posed to have started from a coffee
urn in the restaurant building. The
burned area composed half the busi
ness district of Irvine. The town has
no waterworks, but fortunately there
was little wind blowing. C. C. Dunn
the man who drilled the first oil well
in the now famous Irvine field, was
asleep in his office when the alarm
was sounded and he made a slide for
life down a telephone pole guy wire
escaping from the burning building A
man rooming above the Lyric mov
ing picture show jumped from the
second-story window when the flames
cut off his escape, by the stairway.
He was unhurt. Tom Buford, con
tractor for, the fireproof Williams
bank, dropped dead of heart failure
shortly after the fire broke out. The
excitement hastened his death.
The individual losses were: City
Restaurant, partially destroyed, $10,'
000; T. Q. Wallace, haberdashery
shop, $10,000; Lyric moving picture
show, $10,000; Williams Bank, $15,
000; building containing the Maple
Oil Company's office, Dr. Wilson's
office; City Hall and Mi-s. W. T. Da
vidson's millinery store, $15,000.
Besides these buildings, which
were destroyed, manv others were
damaged. The W. E. Howell jewelry
shop and the Williams residence were
damaged. The new three-story brick
building under construction, at the
corner of Broadway and Main street,
was in the path of the flames, but
because the interior woodwork was
only partly completed, it suffered no
appreciable damage. The large vault
of the Williams Bank remained un
damaged and stands alone amid the
charred embers. Most of the owners
carried insurance.

DEATH MAY ENSUE
ASSAULT ON WAYESBURG MAN
SATURDAY NIGHT
Mitchell Dotson Found In Macksville
With Fractured Skull "Big
Foot" John Suspected
Mitchell Dotson, a young man of
the Waynesburg section, was prob
ably fatally wounded last Saturday
night when he was struck on the
head by a negro in Macksvile. It is
believed that a slung shot or billy of
some sort was used for the dastardly
deed, for a fearful gash was cut in
the left side of Dotsor's head and
physicians said that his skull was
undoubtedly badly fractured.
"Big Foot" John Engleman, who
has been charged with the crime,
was seen leaving town early Monday
morning, after a report became cir
culated that Dotson was dead. Chief
of Police B. D. Carter, who had been
working diligently to learn Dotson's
assailant, says that he has a witness
who says "Big Foot" John was seen
to strike Dotson and then leave him
lying in the middle of Maxville
street, where he was found later and
brought by Chief Carter to town. A
number of Maxville residents are re
ported to have seen the man lying
prone in the street after he was as
saulted but were afraid to go to his
assistance for fear that they would
be thought guilty of the crime.
Dotson came to town Saturday af
ternoon with Green Gooch, a well
known stock buyer of the southern
part of the county. They had a herd
of steers taking them to Lancaster
for court day sale Monday. They
planned to spend Saturday night in
Stanford. About 8 o'clock, Mr.
Gooch went to a barber shop for a
shave and left Dotson outside. When
next he saw him, he was lying sorely
wounded and unconscious. Up until
the time, the injured man was plac
ed in an auto to be taken home, he
had not regained consciousness.
Dotson is about 32 years of age
and is unmarried. He makes his
home with his aged mother, and is
her means of support. He has work
ed for Mr. Gooch a number of years
in the cattle business and Mr. Gooch
says he has always found him abso
lutely faithful and that he wouldn't
harm a soul in the world. The sum
of 75 cents was found in his pockets
when he was brought to town, so just
what the motive of his assailant
could have been is not known. The
negro who is charged with the crime
is a well known character and has
been mixed up in a lot of petty thiev
ery and other meanness several
times. It is thought that he planned
to catch a freight train some where
west of town or else make his way
to Junction City and catch a freight
there for the south. Chief Carter is
satisfied that he will have him in
custody very soon, however.
BOOSTING JAY HARLAN.
