NO. 10. GOOD NAME
Foster respoct for the line you live by, and for the men
who make it.
Never abuse a competitor.'
Cite your able riva's. Praise their deeds. Show pride
that they are compeers. Your own importance is enhanced
by a background of the great.
Don't limelight the unworthy until men feel that your
whole field is infested.
No man can discredit his co-workers without sharing
the shadow himself.
Remember how muckraking once beclouded all the best
in American business. The tew attacked came to typify
the whole. The innocent and guilty suffered equal oppro
brium. Don't invite a like disaster to the confidence you than.
In full force, this applies to advertising.
Note its wonderous growth. Mark the power it wields.
Consider how the ablest men respect it. Think what vast
issues are committed to its care..
You did not make it what it is. Ten thousand men
worked with you. And every man who smirches one bo
comes a mutual enemy.
Protect that priceless prestige by every word and act.
Do your part to dignify the line.
