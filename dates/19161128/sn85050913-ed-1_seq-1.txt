The Minneapolis & St. Louis Rail­
road Company Join in Attack­
ing its Validity.
The Minneapolis & St. Louis rail
road has joined with other steam
roads in an attack on the Adamson
law, passed by'congress late in the
summer. Application for temporary
injunction to prevent the institution
of suits "to foFce tlre'rallroad to come
under the law is to be heard by JudgS"
Henry T. Reed, of the northern dis
trict of Iowa, .at Fort Dodge, at 10
o'clock, Dec. 11.
"t:- The notice of the application runs
against Frank A. O'Connor, of New
Hampton, United States attorney for
the northern district of Iowa, and
.committeemen of the railroad broth
erhoods.
Among the latter are C. E. Sin
clair, of Fort Dodge, a conductor and
l*1 committeeman for the Order of Rail
way Conductors William Jennings,
of Marshalltown, an engineer and
general chairman of the Brotherhood
ot Locomotive Engineers' committee
E. Sinclair, of Fort Dodge, general
chairman of the committee of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen
and Enginemen, and J. E. Arnold of

cites, will be made for a temporary
Injunction to prevent the govern
ment, through its district attorney,
or the brotherhoods, through their
committeemen, from instituting any
proceedings to enforce compliance
under the law.
The application is considered a
precautionary move to prevent the
instit. tion of suits to-compel the
railroad to obey the law when it be
comes effective Jan. 1, 1917.
The M. & St. L. engineers voted
against the strike, but the law hav
ing been passed, the fact that they
were not in sympathy with the en
ine and trainmen's movement would
^nt hinder them or the other unions,

welcome relief from much suffering.
He had been ill with cancer of the

medical aid could do had been done
for him.
Mr. Frakes came to Iowa in the
pioneer days, settling first in Hamil

served in the Civil war and was a
member of the local O. A. R. post. A

HTEHt TAMI
Company Organized to Deal in Em­
ber for Bridge Work—Ready
Demand for Product.
According to a dispatch sent out
from Tama a new industry has
sprung up in that county. Last
spring a man by the name of Geo.
Sheldon removed from Dubuque to
Tama to take over some county
bridge contracts. His work called
attention to the need' of bridge pil
ing, also to its scarcity and high
pric^. He noted the great number
of oak trees along the Iowa river
through Tama county and started
buying up these trees and cutting his
own piling. Immediately he got or
ders from other bridge builders for
this piling, and Mr. Sheldon took in
to partnership with him two of
Tama county's wealthiest men and
organized the George Sheldon com
pany. This company began at once
shipping carloads of native oaks to
ali parts of the country from Tama,
Chelsea and Montour.
Within the last few months while
the business was just starting they
have paid out in wages $20,000 and
for trees in their native state, $10,
000 more. But the business is only
started for Mr. Sheldon recently clos
ed a contract for $146,000 worth of
oak, ash and walnut logs to be ship
ped during the winter months, this
year, to a mill in Piqua, O. This
mill makes this lumber up into ve
neering which is then shipped to
England. Doubtless some of this
same lumber may come back in the
shape of fancy Imported furniture or
old English heirlooms.
The George Sheldon company is
now closing negotiations to open a
mill in Tama to work up the many
elm trees to be found in the vicin
ity, into barrel hoops. There is a
heavy demand at high prices for elm
barrel hoops and the success of this
enterprise is already assured.
The money that will be paid out
during the next few months for la
bor of men and teams and for the
logs will help materially in solving
the high cost of living for many
families. When the hoop mill is
ready to start it will employ about
twenty-five men.
Broke Several Ribs.
Charles Closz fell from a wagon
in which he was standing Saturday
and broke (several ribs. He was
standing too near the side of the ve
hicle, which was being driven, and
when a wheel west into a deep
chuck hole, Mr. Closz pitched over
the side to the ground. As a re
sult of his injuries he will be con
fined to ^is home for several days.

Spoiling a Good Story.
A few days ago a dispatch was
sent out from Webster City stating
that the Illinois Central contemplat
ed double tracking its main line
through Iowa. The Cedar Falls Rec
ord made some investigations on the
strength of that dispatch and com
ments as follows:
"Cedar Falls officials of the Illinois
Central today had no knowledge of
a plan to double-track the road
across the state. They scouted the
idea. However, it was stated that
much construction work in lengthen
ing side-tracks at many towns along
the main lino is now under way. It
was intimated that a new siding aiid
passing track would be laid in the
local I. C. yards next spring.

ATTACK MADE 01M
I0MJIM
Charles Ewin, Co. K., Second Iowa
Infantry, has Experience at
Brownsville.
Brownsville Sentinel: Consider
able excitement was created in the
Iowa canjp a morning or two ago
when an unknown miscreant used a
knife on Private Charles Ewin, of
company, Second Iowa infantry, from
Le Mars, Iowa, a guard at the corral.
Ewin received a slight cut across the
cheek but was otherwise uninjured.
The man was passing a pile of bal
ed hay, according to his story, when
suddenly someone jumped from be
hind the hay and made a lunge in
his direction, catching him with
some sharp object, thought to have
been a knife. The assailant then dis
appeared. Ewin discharged his rifle
several times in the direction tiie
man took. Other guards, brought
by the shooting, made a thorough,
but unsuccessful, search.
When questioned Ewin said he
could not give' a description of the
person who attacked him because of
the darkness. Examinatibn showed
Ewin had suffered only a slight cut
on the cheek but the brim of his hat
was cut and the front of his overcoat
badly ripped. It is believed the man
who attacked the guard was attempt
ing to steal hay.
Looking Over Rest Room.
Joseph Bancroft, a Cedar Falls
florist, was in this city Friday for
the purpose of investigating the rest
room and its means of support. He
had a plan in mind for working out
in Cedar Falls whereby a rest room
and floral station might be combin
ed. His idea was to have a flower
station in the front of s^me store
room and establish a rest room in
the rear of the building. He was
both surprised and pleased with the
location and beauty of the local
rest room and hopes to induce the
business men of his home town to co
operate with him in the permanent
establishment of such a place. The
idea might be feasible with good
management.

Touches Upon the Pavement
The crew of men at work upon
the paving have completed the job
for the present season. The strip of
paving in front of the C. E. Atkin,?
son home on Willson avenue and the
pavement on Seneca street, which
has been the bane of automobile
driveup -for the past year or more
was finished Saturday. The Seneca
street pavement has been so full of
holes that a car driving in that sec
tion has consisted of a series of
bumps for the occupants of autos,
Des Moines street was also patched
up Saturday.
All the sidewalks ordered by the
city ari now in. Other concrete
work will be done next year. The
continued fair weather of this fail

cold snaps are said to have bad no
effect upon the asphalt.
