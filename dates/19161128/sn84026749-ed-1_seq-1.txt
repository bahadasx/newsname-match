believed to be average conditions.
Without designating which plant
had the "suspicious" stock, the report
vtatea that in. ope plant containing
l'U.200 cases of eggs 3H lots were ex
amined and 1UV4 per cent of these
were found to be marked by "blood
tings," superabundant air chambers
and an evaporation of moisture which
had shrunk the eggs and caused bac
teriological changes that resulted In
deterioration, dicay and "rota -In
spots." In the opinion of Dr. Stokes
these processes havo resulted In pto

"If these eggs are eaten In their ad

will cause Intestinal poisoning and

U. S. TO CONSULT AUSTRIA
Will Ask What Aid It Wishes for
Tarnowsky.
The "Dulled States Government will
ask Austria what ahe wishes done In
the matter or the British refusal to
grant safe conduct to .Count .Tarnow
ski, the new Austrian envoy to tho
United States. , J
The State Department today re
ceived England's official refusal, but
decided to do nothing until It further
examines, precedents.
It was Intimated that there was
basis for protest on the Initiative or
thla Government, thought It Is by no
means certain that the' Administra
tion will consider that Its rights
have been Imposed upon. ,
Officials today admitted that It Is
quite possible the count will embark
ror the. United States as per schedule
and run the chance of British inter,
ference with his Journey. In that
case, the parallel of tho Trent affair
in the Civil war might be used as a
basis for strong American demands.
England's refusal to permit passage
of the new Austrian ambassador to
the United States. Count Tarnowskl,
probably Is not final, the British em
bassy said today. Officials there
pointed out that the United States
has not asked for Tarnowskla safe
conduct, and that, therefore, Eng
land's ectlon Is not a direct refusal
to heed thla Government's wishes.

What thn Federal Beserve Board
has sought to do In' Its statement of

short.tnrm on their face, but subject
to renewal Indefinitely, is to stop

EL, PASO, Tex., Nov. 28. Pancho
Villa Is In possession of Chihuahua
city, and General Trevino, with his
Carranxlsta garrison, has evacuated
and fled southward In an atempt to
form a Junction with General Murgla's

With about 400 men drawn from
the garrlsonf or Caaas Granden and

commander at Juares, started toward
Chihuahua city before dawn today on
military trains.

Officers of thn garrison remaining
at 'Juarez declared that Oonxales la

aid or General Trevino, admitting that
the besieged garrison In Uie "Capital
of the North" Is being hard pressed on
all aides by Villa's bandit army.
Andreas. Oarcla. Mexican consul
general, today refused to comment
upon reporta that General Trevino
had been driven out of. Chihuahua
City.
"We have no news," Is all the Mex

Tklnk City May Have Fallen.
Without official news In threo days of
the siege and battle for possession
of Chihuahua City, uncertainty among
United Htstes authorities here Is
verging toward belief today that the
"capital of the north" may have been
captured by Villa's bandit army.
Unless General Trevino, with his
Carranxlsta army. Is now fleeing.
Villa still Is besieging the city on all
sides.
This belief Is founded upon admis

"The prevalence of, crime among
