Report Gains Credence That General Trevino Was Driven Out
BUCHAREST 40 MILES 'IS ESS. SERIOUS SHORTAGE ADNITI
FROM GERMAN FRONT
wire', oss
(Br Aaaoclatad Preaa.)
LONDON, Nov. 23. A
from Bucharest, via Roma, say.t the
military situation Is improving for
the Rumanians. It is claimed that
Von Mackensen is making no ma
terial progress. The Rumanian re
treat is proceeding in perfect order on
a settled front.
(Hr Aaawlaled I'reu.)
The Austo-German invaders are less
than 40 miles from Bucharest and
Oulrglu, 37 miles. The military im
portance is due to the position of the
railroad connection to Bucharest. An
attack from. the north is developing
rapidly.
The entire line of the Alt river In
Rumania, running north and south
through the country from the Tran
nylvanlan Alps to the Danube, now is
in the hands of the Teutonic allies.
In all directions the invaders are con
tinuing to make progress, with Bu
charest, their main objective, daily
coming nearer.
The southern and eastern drive In
the Alt region has brought the Ten
' Ionic forces across the Topolog river,
while to the south between Rourhi
de Vrde and Valeni their line has
been dram considerably nearer the
Rumanian capital. Alexandria, 47
miles southeast of Bucharest, has
been taken by Field Marshal von
Mackensen's troops.
Conslderng the swiftness of the
advance of the Teutonic, allies,
tkrough Wallachia, comparatively few
prisoners have been taken, although
semi-official reports credit them with
having captured considerable supplies
of needed stores. Near Orsova, 28
officers and 1200 men were made
prisoner, while In the Alt region, near
Tigvenl, 10 additional officers and
400 men fell Into the hands of the
Teutons.
In a big buttle extending over a
front of about 17 m lies northwest and
northeast of Moimstlr, between Tren
ova and Maknovo, the entente allies,
according to Berlin, have met with a
severe defeat through the failure of
an attack launched against the lines
of the allies of the central powers.
Aside ' from reports of the repulse of
the Bulgarians by the Serbians and
of continued progress for the Italians
west of Monastlr, the entente allied
war offices record no important en
gagements on the Macedonian front
(By ANKOflated Prtii.)
BERLIN, Nov. 28. The Austro-
Germans in western Rumania are
continuing their drive toward Buchar
est and In the new operations gained
ground. The Bulgarians took Danube
and the town of Giurgiu, on the rail
road. The Rumanian town of Curtea
south of Campulung, was captured.
In eastern Transylvania there Is an
increase of artillery fighting . Russian
reconnoitering detachments have been
repulsed. The River Alt has been
crossed. .

NEW YORK. Nov. 28. To soar
over the north pole In a hydroplane
is the ambition of Roald Ani'indsen,
the Norwegian explorer, who a few
years ago attained the south pole.
Captain Amundsen arrived here today
from Copenhagen to purchase two
hydroplanes for that purpose.
Starting in the summer of 1918, he
auld he expects to be in the far north
from two to five years. The main
object of his flight, Captain Amund
sen declared, would "be to study the
air currents around the pole.
"I shall follow the coast of Siberia
until the Ice breaks up and then
drift toward the pole," said Captain
Ameundsen. " The drift should take
us to a point somewhere near Spltz
bergen and Greenland, after which
wn will make an almost complete
circle of the top of the globe. I hope
to be within one hundred miles of
the pole or 150 at the furthest "when
I leave the ship. Then will follow
the dash by hydroplane or sledges."
I. W. Hitchens, employed by the
T. & G. railroad at Goldfield, killed
his wife and committed suicide last
evening shortly before 7 o'clock. The
couple were well known here, where
Hitchens had worked last Bummer on
the hill as engineer on the ore train
His wife was employed as chamber
maid at the Harrington House. Jeal
ousy was the cause.
Hitchens waa due to go on shift
at the roundhouse in Goldfield last
evening at 7 o'clock, but it Is sup
posed that after eating his evening
meal a quarrel ensued in which he
was prompted to kill his wife. That
the killing was not premeditated Is
surmised from the condition of the
house. The woman met death through
a bullet that went directly through
the heart, apparently fired from be
hind, leading to the suspicion that
the woman turned to flee after find
ing her husband was murderously
inclined.
After the shooting Hitchens turned
the gun on himself and fired one shot
through his right temple which re
sulted In death within half an hour.
The missile carried out both eyes.
Mrs. Hitchens was regarded here
as a woman of amiable character and
one who always showed willingness
to please ber employers, and it was
also known that the couple had
trouble"' owing to the Jealousy of the
husband.
Mrs. Alleen Hitchens was married
to Jack Hitchens In California. She
waa native of Louisville, Kentucky,
and was aged about 26 years. .She
came here with ber husband when
the latter accepted a position as
engineer on the Tonopah ft Goldfield
and they made their home part of
the time here and partly In Goldfield,
according to the husband's run on the
road.

the same route, adds that not only
is Villa proceeding north, but he to in
control of Chihuahua City, which
Gen. Trevino Is said to have aban
doned, proceeding southward. Geo.
Trevino, according to the private re
port, said that after effecting junc
tion with Gen. Murgula he would re
turn and recapture Chihuahua.
The message from Gen. Trerin
was sent in code from Sana- by wf
of OJlnaga, opposite the Texas tow "
of Presidio, where it waa relayed.
It said, according to Carranxa offi
cials, that Villa waa moving north
and ordered the detached garrisons
along this section of the frontier ant
on the Mexico Northwestern Una to
concentrate In Juarez. ' The message.
tbey added, spoke of this as the Oft
day of Villa's attacks.
The countenances of the civil and
military men in Juarez headquarter
showed clearly the seriousness of the
new situation. .t
"No, I think not," waa the answer
given by a Carranxa representative
of high rank, when asked whether
the Villa crisis was yet over.
It is understood that there are
about 500 men, mostly infantry, lit
or near Juarez. . ;
Telegraph communication waa still
open last night with Sane, about 28
miles above Chihuahua, the military
men said. They confessed consider
able anxiety about the Carranza garri
son there. !

has power to compel a carrier to
obtain a federal license or charter
or forbid it to interstate commerce.
Police powers over grade crossings
separate passenger cars for different
races, taxation and other such ques
