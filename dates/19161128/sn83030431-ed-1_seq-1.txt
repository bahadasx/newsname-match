RESERVE BOARD
SEES DANGER IN
FOREIGN LOANS
Banks and Investors Are
Warned About Tying U
Money in Treasury Bills.
WOT IX IXTEWEST
OF THIS COUXTKY"
Liquid Funds Needed in
Various Lines in U. S.,
Says Statement.
MENACE OF IMPORTS
OF (JOLl) MINIMIZED
Some Investments, Short
Time in Name, Imply
Long Renewals.
Washington, Nov. 27. American
bankers were warned by the Federal
Reserve Board to-dny to avoid locking
up their funds by purchasing treasury
bills of foreign Governments Involving;
long term obligations. "While spe
cifically disclaiming any Intention of
reflecting upon the financial stability
of any nation." the board ndvises all
Investors to proceed with caution, and
R formally announced to member
banks of the Federal reserve system
that with the liquid funds, which
should be available to American mer
chants, manufacturers and farmers. In
danger of being absorbed for other
purposes It "does not regard it In the
Interest of the country at this time
that they Invest in foreign treusury
bills of this character, with the privi
lege of renewal."
The statement Is regarded In omclat
circles as one of the most Important
declarations by the board since Its
creation. Officials would not discuss
the question for publication, but some
f them Informally Interpreted the
warning as the Reserve Hoard's unswer
to the recent proposal of J. P. Morgan
Co., Hrltlsh fiscal agents In this
country, to have American bankers ac
cept Hrltlsh treasury hills: of un In
definite total ISHUe. secured by gold
reserves held In Ottawa. Srtch loans
mould be for ninety day periods.
II. P. Davison of the Morgan tlrm was
Ir. Washington recently and conferred
with President Wilson and some of the
members of the Heserve Hoard. It was
laid later that he sought to havo banks
of the reserve system authorized to buy
Hrltlsh treasury bills as If they wore, bills
nf exchange to cover commercial trans
actions. Wlirrr Dangers In (.old Imports Mr
Danger from further Importation of
large amounts of gold, the board says In
' statement, will urlsc only In case the
toM Is permitted become the basis of
undesirable loan expansions and of Infla
'ion, Emphasis Is laid upon the necessity
for caution In putting money Into Invest
ment" which are short term In name, but
which "either by contract or through
force of circumstances may In the uggre
tata hawi to be renewed until normal
lomlltlons return."
The board's warning, In the form of a
statement to bo published later In tho
Ff'l'iul llcservr Hullctin, follows:
"In view of contradictory icports
which have appeareil In tho press regard
ing Its attltudn toward the purchasing by
hanks In this country of treasury bills of
foreign Governments, the board deemn It
a duty to define Its position clearly. In
making this statement the hoard desires
to disclaim any Intention of discussing
the nuances or of reflecting upon tho
financial stability of any nation, but
wishes it understood that It seeks to deal
only with general principles which affect
all alike.
"The board does not smare the view
frequently expressed of lato that further
Importations of largo amounts of gold
must of necessity prove a source of dan
ifcr or disturbance to this country. That
danger, tho board believes, will arise only
In case the Inflowing gold should remain
uncontrolled nnd bo permitted to become
the basis of undesirable loan expansions
and of Inflation.
Uraiu to Control Gold Aeeesslone.
"There are means, however, of con
trolling accessions of gold by proper and
voluntary cooperation of the banks, or If
need he by legislative enactment. An
Important step In this direction would be
the anticipation of the final transfer of
leserves contemplated by the Federal re
erve act to become effective on Novem
ber Ifi, 1917. This date could bo ad
valued o February or March, 1917.
"Mimber banks would then be placed
on the permanent basis of their reserve
requirements, and fictitious reserves
would then disappear ami the banks havo
a cleaier conception of actual reserve
nd financial conditions. It will then
appeir that while a large Increase In the
uuntry's gold holdings has taken place
he expansion of loans and di posits has
bun such that there will not remain any
"xresi of reserve, apart from the Impor
'ml reserve loaning power of the Fed
eral teserve banks,
"In thesi circumstances the board feels
that member bunks should pursue a pot
Icy nf keeping themselves liquid ; of not
loaning down to the legal limit, but of
maintaining an exces of reserves not
with reserve agents, where their bal
ances are loaned out and constitute no
actu.il reserve, but In their own vaults,
or pieferably with their Federal reserve
banks The board believes that at. this
time banks should proceed with much
I'autlon In locking up their funds In long
i"rni obligations, or In Investments which
ate short term In form or name, but
which, either bv contract or through
force of circumstances, may In the ug
unguis hava to be renewed until normal
oiKiitlona return:

TANNER TO RETIRE
AS,STATE CHAIRMAN
Head of Republican Organiza
tion to Pay Less Atten
tion to Politics.
Frederick C. Tanner, Republican State
chairman, nt n conference yesterday In
the St. Hegls Hotel with Gov. Whitman.
Samuel S. Koonlg. Republican County
Chairman: Commissioner F. J. H.
Kracke. William M. Calder. United
States Senator-elect, and Herbert Par
sons, National Committeeman, an
nounced his Intention of resigning his
office as soon us a successor could be
selected.
The Governor endeavored to persuade
Chairman Tanner to remain at the head
of the Itepubllcan State nrganlxatlon.
I but Mi Tanner said that he desired to
retlr- as soon as possible and would
not under any circumstances .retain his
present office. '
"Mr. Tanner Is anxious to retire." said
the Governor, "and he told us that his
business was, such he had to pay more
attention to It and less to politics. I
tried to persuade him to stay, and In
may do It for while." 4
Chairman Tanner's determination to
retire makes It r.ecessary to select a new
head for the State organization, and
while no names were mentioned at yes
terday's conference It Is practically cer
tain that an up-State man will get the
place. A uiee(lng of the State commit
tee to select a new chairman will be
called before Jaruary 1.
Another matter which occupied the
(Inventor's time yesterday was the con
sideration of various appointments be
has at his disposal. The vacancy In the
Court of Appeals caused by the resigna
tion of Samuel Scabury Is to be filled, as
Is also the vacancy caused by the elec
tion of Judge Frunk 11. Hlscock. The
election of Judgi Hounds, serving In the
Court of Appeals, leaves a vacancy In
the Supreme Court.
Senator-elect Calder, It was learned,
asked the Governor to appoint Frederick
E. Crane of llrooklyn to one of the va
cancies. It Is believed Mr. Crane will
get the vacancy In the Supreme Court.
The Governor let It be known that he
will reappoint Charles S. Hervey Public
Service Commissioner for a full term of
(He years when his present term ex
pires In February. There will also be
a vacancy In the near future on the up
State Public Service Commission, and a
new Superintendent of Hanks will be
appointed after January 1,

U 5. TO INSIST ON AUSTRIAN
ENVOY HAVING SAFE CONDUCT
England's Refusal to Grant
Over Count Tarnowski
Notice Before
Wasiiinoto.v, Nov. 27, Another con
troversy between the American Govern
ment and the Entente Allies Is In pros
pect as a result of the refusal of tho
Hrltlsh Government to grant safe con
duct to Count Tarnowski von Tatnow,
the newly appointed Austro-Hungarlau
Amb.iMador to tho United States.
Secretary Lansing said to-night that
this Government would not take un the
i matter until it had been brought to Its
attention through olllclal channels, up
to the present point tho Fulled States
nns not entered Into thu negotiations nt
nil. simply ailing as lntcrnicill.il y to the !
extent of forwarding the reqiutit of the
Aostro-Hungarlan Government for a
safe conduct of the Ambassador.
Tbcro Is an Impression here that the
action of the Hrltlsh Government may
have been precautionary to the extent of
nniuing up iito Ambassador until It had
"""lalncd to Its satisfaction that there
was no ono In his suite who might be
supceieu or attempting to repeat the of.
for'.s of Von l'apen of the Gciman Em-
baesy.
It is believed that If Count Tarnowski
takes passage from a neutral port on a
neutral ship he will not bo disturbed by
the Hrltlsh authorities, us such an act
might b regarded as one of discourtesy
town i il the t'niti'd Stales.
Aside from the belief that England
would not dolrc to nrouse adverse feel
ing in the Fnlted States by Interference
with the ancient and eenerallv tinnues.

the right of diplomatic ofllcers to make

will bo on that basis that tho matter of
