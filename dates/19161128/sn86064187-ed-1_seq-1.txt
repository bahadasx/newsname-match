Gain of Thirty Pounds in Weight
CHICAGO, Nov. 28. Whether the laughter and good fellowship at the
dining table of the Chicago diet squad is responsible in any measure
for the increasing weight of its members was a problem being studied
today by the sponsors for the test which is intended to prove that it is
possible to live well on 40 tents a day.

tipped the scale at lol'J pounds, a loss of three-fourths of a pound.
Dr. John Dill Robertson, city health commissioner, asserted today that
in his opinion the test thus far has been a success and added that "the
one definite lesson for housewives thus far is that they should go to
market and bring their purchases home with them."

Rumanians Driven Back.

cording to an official statement issued
this afternoon, lour persons were in
Hired and only slight material dam
age, it added, was inflicted.
Two Ar Destroyed.
Two Zeppelins which raided the
northeast coast and the north midland
counties during the night were brought
down and destroyed by British airman
and it is understood the crews of both)
airships perished. This makes a total
, ,; marhjnes destroyed in
...... - .
f.ngland in the present year while si
have been brought down in other fields
of operation.
The two months of immunity which
England has had from hostile air raida
led many persons to believe the Ger
mans would not risk any airships in
attacks, which, while causing numerous
casualties among civilians and damaga
to private property were said in Eng
land to have gained no military advan
tage for them. The authorities, regard
ing the protection of l.ondon as fairly
complete, continued their work, how
ever, with the object of rendering other
parts of the country safe. The succesa
of the air patrols this morning has giva.
en the greatest satisfaction here.
Enemy Heavily Bombarded.
Official reports do not say how many
airships crossed the coast hut apparent
ly they were hotmWded so heavily by
anti-aircraft guns as well as being at
tacked by airplanes, that they were un
able to do much damage. Lights wera
turned out in all the towns in the dis
tricts affected as soon as reports bt
the approach of airships were an
nounced and the commanders of tha
Zeppelins apparently had difficulty in
locating themselves. A number of
bombs were dropped although no re
ports of damage in any towns havo
been received thus far.
One Zeppelin discharged her carira
of explosives in Yorkshire and Dur
ham. She was attacked by a single air
plaae and fell in flames off the Durham
coast.
Brought Down in Sea.
Another got as far as the north mid
land counties and likewise dropped
bombs. She was attacked by airplanes
and guns and apparently descended tr
make repairs. After reaching the Nor-,
folk coast she started for home at high
speed and at a high altitude. Naval
airplanes were awaiting her and with
the aid of an armed trawler brought
her down before she had gone many
miles.
Great crowds, attracted to the sea
coast by the firing, watched the Zeppe
lins as they descended in flames.
One September 1.
On September 1 five airships raided
the country surrounding England and
one machine was brought down in
flames.
On September 6 a squadron of Zep
pelins attempted to reach 1-ondon and
this time anti-aircraft guns brought
down two machines. The crew of ona
airship perished and the crew of tha
other, consisting of twenty-two men,
was captured.
Russians Capture Crew.
On November 16, Petrograd -reported
that Russian troops near Pinsk, in tha
eastern battle line, brought down a
large Zeppelin and captured the crew
of sixteen.
The first Zeppelin to meet with dis
aster in the English raids was the L-15,
which was forced down in an attack
on l.ondon March 31 ind captured in
the Thames estuary. The airship sunkj
while in tow of a British patrol hoar.
Prior to this on January 31, the L-18
was seen in the North Sea in a sink
ing condition, and is believed to hava
been damaged by the English coast
bayeries. After one of the early raida
on England on February 18, 191 S. tha
Zeppelin was lost in a snowstorm
and forced to land in Denmark whera
she was burned by her crew, fourteen
ot whom were interned by the Danish
authorities.
