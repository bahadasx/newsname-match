123 PEOPLE CONTRIBUTE
$4,226.95 FIRST DAY
Better Showing is Expected
As Only 21 Solicitors Re
ported Monday More
Workers For Today.
Approximately one-tenth of the
J 1 1.700 that the South Pend Federa
tion for Social Service is trying to
secure for the 13 members of the or
ganization was raised hy the workers
Alnday, the opening day of the
(li'oj Will week campaign. The
act figures for the day's collection
-re $4.226.95, and according to the
report, this amount was donated by
122 people.
According to these figures, each
person who contributed to the Good
Will fund Monday gave an average
f about I'M.'M. which those in
tharRc of the campaign say is ex
ceptionally good. The reports of
nly 21 workers were reeeivt!,
showing that each one turned' fn
average of about $201.28 for the
opening day.
In spite of the apparently good
averages, the day's collections fell
tolow the amount that hid been ex
pected. In order to secure the $41,
7 00 it would have been necessary
'or the workers to secure approxi
mately $7,000 each day. With only
rive days of the campaign left, in
cluding today, those who are doing
the collecting now must get about
$7.60 0 each day.
;rjxn More to See.
Mark L. Duncan, executive secre
tary of the federation, pointed out
Tuesday morning that while 12 3
people already have contributed,
there are about R5.0C0 more people
in South Pend who have given noth
ing far. Tie showed that if half
of these people were to give $1
apiece, the federation would not fall
lar short of the amount it had set
out to secure.
More workers were on the jon
Tuesday morning, there being about
173 collectors soliciting in all parts
of the city during the day. ' Owing
to the fact that an extra force of
.he workers was added, it is expect
d that Tuesday's collections will
amount to more than those of the
preceding day. bringing the total up
to the general average. All of the
Kiwanis club members who agreed
to as-i;t In the campaign were at
work Tuesday.

C.cii. Trevino, Carranza commander,
having evacuated the town. The
'announcement' was made with the
statement that "the report has not

The source of t the information was
not revealed.
Confirmation would change alto

Army Will Stick.
All hope of immediate withdrawal
of the American troops must be
abandoned, otlieer.s cf the general
staff of the army' fteclared today.
Villa already haft threatened to
occupy the line of Pershing's en
campment as soon; as that com
mander evacuates. Such action on
his part would leave the American
frontier entirely at the mercy of
the Villa troop?. ,
The protocol . feigned at Atlantic
City outlining the plan for border
control stipulated that the with
drawal of I'ershing'H troops would
be contingent upon developments in
northern Mexico. Regardless of
4 I
den. Carranza's decision as to the
protocol, war department officials
today were convinced that the ac
tivities of den.' Villa himself and
not den. Carranza "are to demand
the most serious attention of the
