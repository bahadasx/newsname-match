marine warfare brought to this side
of the Atlantic Sunday, was pur
sued relentlessly throughout the night.
The captain of the Nantucket light
ship reported that three German subma
rines were operating south and southeast
of Nantucket and that a total of nine
vessels had been destroyed.
Jtushing to gne battle to the subma
rines, three British cruisers were off
Nantucket shoals early today. The be
lief is growing that the U-53 which
went into Newport Saturday, ported a
letter to ambassador von Bern-itorff and
then left. t only one of a flotilla of sub
marines gathered for attacks on vessels
of the allied nation and neutral bot
toms carrying contralnnd of war.
Shipping at ports along the New Eng

Question of Whether Amer

Lost Causes Worry.
Lone Branch, N J , Oct. 9 Presi
dent Wilson today received all avail
able details nf the activities of Ger
man submarines off the American coast
in the sinking of steamers It was a
matter which caused the president
great concern.
President Wilson announced today
that "The German government will be
held to the fulfillment of its promises
to the government of the United
States." He added that he bad no
right now to question Germany's will
ingness to fulfill the promises.
The questions of officials centered
whether any American lives had been
lost and whether the vessels had been
warned in advance in accordance with
international law.
With the receipt of word of the sink-.
ing oi the vessels so near tbe Ameri
can coast, additional importance was
attached to the visit here today of
count von Bernstorff, the German am
bassador. While the engagement of
the ambassador with the president was
made to enable him to give Mr. Wil
son a personal letter from the German
emperor on Polish relief, it was taken
for granted that the activities of the
German submarine would be discussed
The president will see Jules Jusser
and. the French ambassador on Tues
day. While arrangements for his visit
were made through the state depart
ment, officials here took It for grant
ed that he also wanted to discuss
Polish relief with the president.

being made public.
At daylight Sunday tbe U-SX turned
up southeast of Nantucket and got in
the way of the American steamer Kan
sas of the American Hawaii company
bound from New York to Genoa by
way sf Boston with freight. The com
pany's boat was flying the American
flag. She was stopped by tbe sub
marine at S:M oclocVi Assured that
the kanaan was an American owned
snip, the submarine allowed her to
proceed.
Strnlhilrnr ! Slink.
A half hour later tbe submarine en
countered the Strathdene. commanded
by Capt. Wilson, and under charter
by the French line A subsequent mes
sage from the Nantucket lightship
stated that the Strathdene had been
sunk at oclock in the morning and
that the "crew of 2s men" were on
the lightship. The steamer carried a
crew of 34. There was doubt as to
whether the lightship bad picked them
all up The Strathdene sailed from
New York for Bordeaux Saturday af
ternoon "Went Point Ron Donm.
The submarine next came up with
the West Point, bound from London
to Newport News.
The fate of the British freighter was
told In the following wireless dispatch
from her commander. Capt. Harden, to
tbe naval radio station -
"British steamer West Point, stopped
by submarine and fired upon, getting
boats ready. Position 40 24 north. 69
west. Get cutter"
Later messages gave further details.
One stated that the steamer was being
shelled by the submarine when the
message was sent at 11 15 a. m A

Destroyer Fleet Ordered Out.
Immediately after the "S OS" rails
from the West Point were picked up
at Newport admiral Gleaves ord2r. d '
out tne destroyer fleet to give assist
ance The Jarvis, one of the fastest
of the fleet, being capable of making
31 knots, had steam up and was one
of the first to get aval She steamed
out of the harbor at full speed shortly
before 1 30 oclock
Following the Jarws as rapidly as
steam could be made went the destro
ers Drayton. Ericson. Brien. Benham.
Cassin, Balch. McgaH. Porter. Fanning.
Winslow. Avlwin, Cushing, Cummings,
Pauldinf and Conynham, and the tender
Melville. The fleet went to sea under
full speed
The destroyers had orders from rear
admiral Gleaves, commander of the de
stroyer force, to spread out and search
for ship's boats. He said that the ob
ject in sending this large number of
essels was to facilitate the locating
of small boats.
The Kingston Is Sunk.
Shortly after i oclock at night, a
wireless message was received stating
that the Kingston had been sunk by a
submarine This was later confirmed
bv admiral Knight at Newport. All on
board the steamer were picked up bv
one of the destroyers sent our from
Newport.
At 9 oclock all the passengers and
crews of the torpedoes vessels had been
accounted for with th exception of
the crew of the Kingston These were
missing and were being sought by the
American destroer Cushing.
