SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN TWO SUBS
Boston, Oct. 9. With a few addi
tional reports available today the
story of submarine activity off Nan
tucket lightship yesterday was chang
ed only slightly from the first stories
; received. If the Germans continued
their work today,, nothing has been
hoard of it and it seemed likely they
Secretary Daniels informed the
president that as far as he could as
certain all international laws had been
observed. The navy department how
ever is prepared to establish a patrol
along the North Atlantic coast to see
that American neutrality is observed.
Six ships in all are positively known
to have been sunk, although the com
mander of the destroyer Ericsson re
ported he understood nine had gone.
No names of additional vessels are
mentioned. The report that nine were
sunk is from no other source. The on
ly persons from the six vessels not ac
counted for was the crew of the King
; Rton which took to the boats. Amer
; icatv destroyers havecombed the calm

Storied of the number jf submarines
' differed widely but many believed
1 there were two. It is assumed the
U-53, which came to Newport Satur
day was active. The survivors . of
tno ship said they were-certain they
?;av U-C3 on another sub. As far as
it -is known only six torpedoes were
fired. The U-53 carried eight, v ; - .

State Democratic Committee Endors
ed Wilson, Knott, Clark' and
Taylor
Jacksonville, Oct. 8 The state dem
ocratic executive committee convened
yesterday pursuant to .the call of
Chairman George P. Raney of Tampa,
forty-two counties being represented.
HalAdams of LaFayette county, of
fered a resolution recommending the
placing of the names of both Catts
and Knott on the ballot to be voted
on in the general election in Novem
ber. This was ruled out of order by
Chairman Raney, because the secre
tary of state alone is clothed with the
power to certify the names of candi
dates to be printed on the ticket. On
an appeal from the ruling the chair
was sustained by a vote of thirty-one
to ten.
J. B. Hodges of Lake City then of
fered a resolution that the committee
take no action as to who was the reg
ular democratic nominee for governor.
He spoke at great length in support
of his resolution, and when he closed
E. W. Davis of Orange county offered
a substitute "resolution, calling upon
the democrats of Florida : to rally to
the support of W. V. Knott as the
regular democratic nominee for gov
ernor, Woodrow Wilson for president,
R. F. Taylor for - justice of the su
preme court and Frank Clark for
Congress from ; the second district.
The substitute was adopted by a vote
f 28 to 13.
The committee then adjourned.
- The campaign committee met after
adjournment of the state committee
and considered various matters relat
ing to the campaign of the next five
weeks in behalf of the democratic
nominees.

Saturday's Session of State Can vass

Tallahassee, Oct. 8. Secretary of
State Crawford last night sent out in
structions to the various counties to
place Knott's name on the ballot as
the democratic nominee. Flournoy
made another effort yesterday to" re
open the case, but failed. Not satis
fied with the decision against him
Friday, Flournoy Saturday morning
formally asked the supreme court for
permission to amend his ; petition
which was denied yesterday. --Secretary
of State Crawford stated
that he considered yesterday the last
day and last night mailed out instruc
tions for the printing of the ballots to
the various counties. "Whoever was
the nominee at the close of business
yesterday will have his name printed
on the ballots as such" said Mr.
Crawford.
The socialists sent a petition to the
secretary of state instead of holding
a caucus, convention or primary, and
Secretary Crawford wired them " of
their mistake. , The petitions should
not be sent to Tallahassee, but to the
various boards of county commission
ers...'', f -.. '" A',.. ' '::'r : .'.
Mitchell, the V independent, of St.
Petersburg, made the same error of
sending his petitions to the secretary
of state instead of to the county com
missioners. Crawford has wired both
the socialists and Mitchell what the
law provides and stated that they had
until twenty days prior to the election
to get on the ticket in proper shape,
but in both instances they must go
through .the county commissioners.
C G. Allen and Mitchell may get
on the ticket through the counties but
not by order of the secretary of state.
Mr. Crawford returned their petitions
to them.
The name of George W. Allen went
out in the instructions last night .as
the regularly nominated republican
nominee, that party having had a con
vention. Catts will also go on the
ticket as the nominee of the prohibi

as an independent, but these must go
through the counties, i '
