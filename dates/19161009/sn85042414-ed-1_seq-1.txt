Boston, Oct. 9—The German sub
marine warfare was suddenly
brought to this side of the Atlantic on
Sunday by the U-53 and pursued re
lentlessly throughout the night.
With dawn came reports of nine
vessels being torpedoed and sunk.
The captain of the Nantucket light
ship, off which the attacks on pas
senger and freight ships were made,
reported that three German sub
marines were operating south and
southeast of Nantucket and that a
total of nine vessels have been de
stroyed.
The identity of the three vessels
are unknown, but ships from the
American destroyer flotilla at New
port are searching the seas for the

MANY WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE IN PERIL
Boston, Oct. 9.—Nine Atlantic steamers have been
sunk within 100 miles of the coast of the United States
within the past 24 hours by German submarines and the
shipping of the north Atlantic is panic stricken.
The identity of the German submarine is not certain,
but there seems to be no doubt that the U-53 which came
into Newport so boldly on Saturday was one of the mar
rauders passengers of one of the sunken vessels say they
saw "U-61" on the side of another. The general opinion ex
pressed by naval men is that there is a flotilla of subma
rines off the coast accompanied by a supply ship.
The vessels sent to the bottom by the submarines in
clude the following:
STRATHDENE, British freighter, from New
York to Bordeaux, torpedoed off Nantucket. Crew in
their own,boats made for Nantucket Shoals lightship
and were later removed to Newport by U. S. destroy
ers.
WEST POINT, British freighter, torpedoed and
sunk near the Strathdene. Was bound for Newport
News from London. Crew saved in their own boats
and picked up by U. S. destroyers.
STEPHANO, British passenger liner bound from
Halifax to New York, torpedoed and sunk southeast
of Nantucket. Passengers and crew numbering 140
were picked up by destroyer Drayton and taken to
Newport.
KINGSTON, British freighter, reported sinking
by wireless but no trace of crew. Maritime registers
show Kingstonian as only vessel of similar name.
BLOOMERSDIJK, Dutch freighter, from New
York to Rotterdam, sunk and crew rescued by destroy
ers. Had cargo of grain valued at $500,000.
CHRISTIAN KNUDSEN, Norwegian freighter,
sunk about the same time and place as the Bloom
ersdijk. Crew saved.
Three other steamers are reported by wireless to
have been torpedoed and destroyers are searching for
their crews. The identity of these three has not been
established.
Admiral Albert Gleaves, commander of the U. S. de
stroyer flotilla announced this afternoon that he had ob
tained the names of approximately 220 persons including
83 women and ten children rescued from five of the six
steamers known to have been torpedoed. The list omitted
the crew of the Kingston, missing. The admiral said all
hands were saved from the West Point, Strathdene,
Bloomersdijk, Christian Knudsen and Stephano.
No definite word had been received today of the fate
of the crew of the vessel recorded in wireless messages as
the British steamer Kingston, one of the victims of the
German submarine.
Washington, Oct. 9.—The navy department today be
gan preparations to establish a naval patrol of warships
along the North Atlantic coast, to make certain that Amer
ican neutrality is not violated by the submarine raid on al
lied shipping.
The possibilities of complications with the allies be
came apparent today, in the allies' contention that subma
rines, because of their nature, should be excluded from
neutral ports.
The Manchester Guardian is quoted in a London dis
patch to the effect that such a view has been set out in a
recent memorandum of the allies to neutrals.

members of the crew of the liner and
one officer told her they had distinctly
seen the attacking submarine through
their glasses, that it was U-61.
One of destroyer Batch's cre.w said
he saw a German supply ship attend
ing the submarine.
American destroyers witnessed the
destruction of some of the vessels. In
one instance American boats were so
thick on the scene that the submarine
commander asked the destroyers Ben

him to blow up his prey.

New Yorkers Panicky in
Fear for Friends on Lin
ers Nearing Coast.
New York. Oct. 9.—Owners, agents
and others interested in vessels now
near the Atlantic coast flying flags of
nations hostile to Germany, showed
great anxiety today and sought every
possible avenue of news regarding
their ships.
Many of the vessels are within the
German U-boat danger zone carrying
scores of American and European
passengers, including some notable in
financial business, theatrical and so
cial circles.
It seemed doubtful today that the
submarine raid would result in a gen
eral tie-up of the shipping of the en
tente nations in American ports, but
one of the most important steamship
companies controlling British-Ameri
can vessels, the International Mer
cantile Marine company, issued orders
that no British ships of that line
should leave Atlantic ports until fur
ther orders.
This order stopped the sailing of
all steamers of the White Star Atlan
tic transport, including the Leyland,
Dominion and vessels of the White
Star Dominion lines sailing for Mon
treal and Quebec. The order does not
interfere with the sailing of Ameri
can line steamships or any of the
companies' vessels under the Ameri
can flag.

NEUTRALITY MAY BE
TESTED TO LIMIT
Germany Embassy Officials
Do Not Conceal Their
Satisfaction.
Washington, D. C., Oct. 9.—Ger
many's extension of her submarine
warfare to the waters off the coasts
of the United States apparently is not
regarded with apprehension by ad
ministration officials, although it is
realized it may develop a situation
presenting new and perplexing ques
tions of neutrality.
Formal comment is withheld to
day pending the receipt of details of
the exploits of the U-53. and her pos
sible sister submarines. There is lit
tle disposition to believe American
Interests are menaced. The fact that
warning apparently was given to
enable those aboard the steamers to
be placed in safety strengthened the
belief of officials that Germany is
keeping her pledge to remain within
international law.
It was openly declared, however,
that the submarine operations mark
the opening of an organized cam
paign in the waters adjacent to
America against all commerce of the
allies in general and especially ves
sels carrying munitions of war.
Transports from Canada in Danger.
It Is expected that attacks also will
be directed at transports carrying
troops from Canada and at British
and French warships on patrol duty1
off the coast.
Diplomatic representatives of the
cental powers declared,, emphatically
that they knew the assurances re
garding the conduct of submarine
warfare given to the United States
would be strictly adhered to and that!
no vessels would be sunk without
warning or before the passengers and
crews had been given opportunity to
reach a place of safety.
It was suggested in some quarters
that the boat campaign probably
would not be long confined to north
ern waters.
Some of the westbound traffic it
was thought, probably would be di
verted to southern ports where the
submarine or submarines now off the
New England coast would follow.
It also was pointed out that the
fleet of tankers carrying oil eastward
from the Tamplco fields for the Brit
ish navy might offer a tempting field
for boat operations.
Teutons Diplomats Rejoice.
News of the sinking of the many
ships today drew expressions of sat
isfaction from the ranking Teutonic
diplomats.
The German embassy still main
tained that It was without prior
knowledge whatsoever regarding the
visit of the U-53 of her mission in
American waters.
The dispatch sent to Count von
Bernstorff by Lieutenant Captain Han
Rose arrived today but was said to
have contained no information of im
portance. Neither did it enclose any
official communication from the Ger
man government. The dispatch was
brief, being written in German upon
one sheet of paper.

NO WARNING
SAYS CAPTAIN Of THE

New York, Oct. 9.—The British

Ehip commander, Capt. Wilson, who
was brought into port today by the
steamer Elm from Quebec with 35
members of the crew.
HOLD GERMANY
TO PROMISES,
SAYSWIISON
President Says He Cannot
Question Willingness
to Do so Now.
Long Branch. X. J., Oct. 9.—Presi
dent Wilson intimated today that as
a result of the submarine attacks off
the American coast the "German gov
ernment will be held to a fulfillment
of its promises to the United States."
Just, before German Ambassador
Von Bernstorff called.at Shadow Lawn
today President Wilson issued' this
statement:
"The U. S. government will of
course first inform itself as to all
facts, that there may be no doubt or
mistake as far a* they are concerned.
The country may rest assured the
German government will be held to a
complete fulfillment of its promises
to the government of the United
States. I have no right now to ques
tion its willingness to fulfill them."
Washington, Oct. i».—The Ameri
can government's attitude toward the
German side of the new situation will
be decided by President Wilson him
self.
The position of the United States so
far as it has been announced has been
to decide on its merits, the case of
each submarine entering an Ameri
can port. Inasmuch as the German
submarine which entered Newport
Saturday took no supplies, asked for
no privileges and departed almost
immediately, it is not thought that
any issue has been raised.
Expect Attacks South Next..
The general opinion prevailing to
day was that with the gathering of
allied cruisers oft the New England
coast the submarines would desert
that field and strike their next blows
farther south. Some officials expected
to hear of operations in the Gulf of
Mexico where a persistent story says
a German base has been established
and where the submersibles could
strike at the fleets of tank ships car
rying fuel oil to the British navy from
the Mexican oil fields, upon which the
British depend almost entirely.
The opinion that there are" several
submarines accompanied by a supply
ship, off Nantucket, probably also
submersible, has been strengthened
by the latest developments.
The navy department received a
message from Rear Admiral Knight,
commanding at Newport, saving that
destroyers of the Atlantic "fleet had
picked up approximately 220 surviv
ors from six steamers of whom 33
were women and 10 were children.
The hands (crew) were saved in
each case except the Kingston's, the
crew of which Is supposed to be in
the ship's boats within 30 miles of
Nantucket lightship, said the report.
The destroyers are continuing the
search. All survivors are being well
cared for.
