TELLS PLANS OF
HOUSING CO. FOR
DWELLINGS HERE
Two Suburban Colonies Pro
posed, Says Manager F.
L. Blanchard.
By reason of highly boosted rents
ordinary workers in Bridgeport as well
as those of the skilled classes are com
pelled to deprive themselves and their
families of needed' things In order to
pay for living quarters.
, This assertion made by Frederick
C. Blanchard, general manager of the
Bridgeport Housing Co., is followed by
the statement to friends at ".The Strat-
ffieW where he was banquetted Satur
day night that the housing company
plans not only quickly to house the
unmarried men and women workers in
dormitories but to build two large col
onies accessible to the East and to the
West EnHs of the city for the skilled
workingman and his family.
A pleasant external appearance in
these colonies will be assured with
symmetrical rows of trees, gardens for
each family, which in a measure will
be obligatory, playgrounds for ' the
children and other accessories to the
three ' arid four room apartments the
houses will contain." -
In a speech before his former asso
ciates in the Ashcroft Manufacturing
Co., and the1 Consolidated Valve Co.,
Mr. Blanchard said:
"The Bridgeport Housing Co., with
which I am nowx associated, promises
very strongly to perform a most use
ful service to the city of Bridgeport,
that is the Increase of the housing
facilities. ,
"I think yu realize more than ever
before the serious conditions that a
great many men have to face in or
der to stay at work in Bridgeport. A
man recently came to my house at
night and after apologizing for intru
sion upon my privacy related the fact
that he -was being paid from $11 to
$15 per week as a polisher at the
Graphophone plant. A few days pre
vious to his call his new landlord
called upon him to say that in future
instead of a $15 rent he would pay
$25 per month for-the same quarters.
To pay this simply meant that his
wife and children must give up those
things they much needed. " It was im
possible to pay the renc without many
sacrifices.
The Bridgeport Housing Co. is go
ing ahead in a comprehensive manner
to create housing that will meet the
prevailing conditions, on an econom
ical basis.
The most modest of the plans now
considered will be for single men
or women In the forms of dormitor
ies sanitary and with bathing faclli
its including showers and bath
rooms. Some apartments will be as
small as two rooms, for the young
man who la just married will not
need more room at the outset. That
man can live with comfort in a two
room apartment. They will be sub
stantial, light and airy apartments.
Compared with present conditions
where such a man has to go into a
private family, he will be very much
better off.
"There will also be three and four
room apartments and perhaps some
even larger for the unskilled labor
er. "For the skilled laborer and ones
with larger families there will be
complete suburban development, some
within reach of the East Side and
some for the West End. These will
be reasonably large tracts of land
with an eye to external appearance,
roads, sidewalks, playgrounds and
trees . planted with symmetry. There
will be a space for a garden which
everybody will be required to keep.
The houses will not be crowded in so
as to give a 'close' feeling, as you now
have in many places in Bridgeport
There will be light and air all around.
Everybody will be required to keep
his place neat and clean and prizes
for the best kept will be offered."

HOMES ARE OPENED TO
SURVIVORS OF ATTACK
Newport, R. I., Oct. 8. Eye wit
nesses' stories of the torpedoing of the
passenger anid) freight steamers by
ierman submarines off Nantucket
yesterday were told here today.
According to a report brought by of
ficers of a flotilla of United States de-'
stroyers, which picked up passengers
and crews of several of the vessels de
stroyed, nine merchant ships were
sunk.
One of the submarines is supposed
to have been the U-53 which visited
this harbor Saturday and another was
declared! to be the U-61. Mrs. Henry
B. Wilson, of Williamstown, Mass., a
passenger of the Stephano, one of the
vessels sunk, said that an officer and
several of the crew told her that they
had distinctly seen the name of U-61
cr the submarine that attacked their
ship.
Six vessels are known to have teen
sunk and the report that the total
was nine was based on a statement of
the captain of the Nantucket Shoals
Lightship, near which the attacks took
place. The captain said that three
submarines were engaged.
The list of submarine victims includ

New Tork, Oct. 9 Owners, agents
and others Interested in vessels near
the Atlantic, coast flying the flags of
nations hostile to Germany passed an
uneasy night an&V today sought every
possible avenue' of news regarding
their ships. Many of the vessels with

Itseemed doubtful today that the
submarine raid would result in a gen
eral tie up of the shipping of the en
tente nations in American ports, but
the International Mercantile Marine
Co., controlling both American and
British vessels, issued orders that no
British ships of that line should leave
Atlantic ports pending further orders.
This order stopped the sailing of all
steamers of the White Star, Atlantic
Transport, Leyland, Dominion and

pointed out, all vessels armed of that
line have 4.7 inch guns and the Ger

freight steamers are believed today
to be near Nantucket. Some are bound

others eastbound from here. A con
