This Citj In 11)17.
The announcement that the Ken
tucky Stale Sunday School Association
would hold its untiual session in this
city In 1017, the first news of which
appeared exclusively in Saturday's
Ledger, created a bit of comment
among the Sunday School workers of
this city and County.
The credit for getting the conven
tion to come to this city must fail
chiefly upon Miss Mary Wilson of this
city, although several others from the
oily and county were in attendance at
the meeting of Use City Sunday School
Hoard and they seemed to think that
such a convention would be an excel
lent thing for this city. She had prev
iously obtained (he 0, K. of the Cham
ber of Commerce to ask the convention
here. When Bbe went to the Conven
tion she presented the lai.es of I hit
city for the convention.
Ashland was Hie paly other city in
the state that seemed to cure to hav
the convention next year. Indeed, so
close was the race between the two
that Maysville won by the narrow
margin of three voees. .Maysville Is
somewhat more centrally located thai
Ashland and considering the fact that
the convention has not been hctil in
this city for H years we were tin
lucky city.
The local bourd will begin prepar
ing some things for the convention n
once although a great many details
ii' list be worked out later. Plans will
be made throughout the entire tr Inter
for an excellent convention und help
t bei'r jut Maysvllle's reputation as P.
good convention city. The cor-opera-tlon
of all the church workers in tic
city is asked to make the convention a
very successfuu one.
UWK EXCELLENT Ml SIC
The Hluegrass Concert Hand of this
city furnished the music for the Mays
ville Colored Fair on Friday and Sat
urday. They gave excellent music,
playing some of the latest popular
music as well as some of the more
classic. Their music was greatly en
joyed. TAKEN SICK IS ( HI Hi ll
