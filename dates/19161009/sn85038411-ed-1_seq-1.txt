The Boston Americans defeated the Brooklyn Nationals by a
score of 2 to 1, in a fourteen inning battle today that was filled
with thrills and spectacular plays. It was a battle of southpaws,
Babe Ruth, of the Bostons against Shcrrod Smith, of Brooklyn and
though Smith went down to defeat when a pinch hitter. Gainer,
drove over the winning run, there was glory enough for victor and
vanquished.
The crowd numbered officially 41,373 persons. Brooklyn defence
as well as, that of Boston sparkled with brilliant plays.
Myers was the fair haired boy for Brooklyn. He scored the
■visitors only run with a four-ply clout to right center and then cut
off a Boston run in the ninth inning by a nice catch and line throw
to the plate doubling Janvrin.

REPORTED AFIRE
Forest Fires Raging and Scores
of Village in Elk County
Are Threatened
Kane, Pa., Oct. 9.—Forest fires are
raging in the western part of Elk and
i section of Forest counties,
with telegraph and telephone wires
down as a result of the fires, many
sections are cut ofT, and so far only
three towns have been heard from.
These are Nansen, Russell City and
Rrookton. Only meager news comes
I from these, but at a late hour reports
that came in indicated that they would
bo wiped out. As there are between
twenl> and thirty towns and villages in
the district now in the throes of the
flames, it is feared all will meet the
same fate. No estimate can be placed
on the losses, but it will probably be
in the hundreds of thousands.
The first news of the fire came yes
terday afternoon when calls for aid
were sent out from N'ansen. The fire
had been raging there for eighteen
hours and the residents fought back
the flames for hours. Despite plowing
arid other plans to thwart the tire the
flames were fanned by a swift breeze

Threatened Complication With Allies Over Torpedoing of
Nine Ships in U. S. Coastal Waters by Two German
Underwater Raiders, Lies in Contention That Sub
marines Should Be Excluded From All Neutral
Ports; Loss of Single Life Would Open Entire Con~
troversy
Newport, R. 1., Oct. 9.—Eye-witness stories of the torpedoing ol
passenger and freight steamers by German submarines off Nan
tucket yesterday were told here to-dav.
According to a report brought by officers'of a flotilla of United
States destroyers which picked up passengers and crews of several
of the vessels destroyed, nine merchant ships were sunk.
One of the submarines is supposed to have been the U-53 which
visited this harbor Saturday and another was declared to be the
U-61. Mrs. Henry I>. \\ ilson, of Williamstown, Mass., a passenger
on the Stephano, one of the vessels sunk, said that an officer and
several of the crew told her that they had distinctly seen the name
U-61 on the submarine that attacked their ship.
Six vessels are known to have been sunk and the report that
the total was nine was based on a statement of the captain of the
Nantucket shoals lightship near which the attacks occurred. The
captain said that three submarines were engaged.
