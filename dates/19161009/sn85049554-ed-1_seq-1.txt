'injury but' lost nearly all their effects.
When the Ericsson, which picked up
some of the Stephano boats, arrived
at the I lightship, Commander Miller
said he had observed a submarine
about a mile distant and heard three
shots from the bow gun. In the haze
he could dimly make out the Steph

The Stephano hove to and sent a
message to the Ericsson: "Please take

Before Commander Miller could
compiy. she-had loaded all her passen
gers in their own boats. The Steph
ano was still afloat when the destroyer
left but was report eft later as sunk by
a torpedo. The Ericsson brought here
twenty-five women and ten children,
while the destroyer BaJch brought
sixty-nine others from the. Stephano.
Eighteen of "the women were landed
at the government pier and were taken
in automobiles to the homes of Gover
nor R. Livingstone Beeckman, Mrs.
Xtomellus Vanderbilt and Arthur Cur

Dr. Andrews, of the Orenfell mis
sion, was one of the four Stephano
passengers taken to the home ofWrs.
Cornelius Vanderbilt. He declared the
Germans gave proper warning and then
stood by until all passengers had been
taken off.
"Officers of the Ericsson visited the
Stephano to make sure that/all the
passengers and crew were safe," he
said. "The Germans then boarded her
and opened her water cocks."

Meanwhile the Bloomersdljk was
standing a short distance away "like
a steer waiting to bo slaughtered," in
•the words of Dr. Andrews.- She had
been warned to hold up.

Braves Field, Boston, Oct. 7. The
Boston Americans, with one victory
notched in their bat handles, met the
Brooklyn Nationals here this afternoon
in ine second gains of tue world's
series. The Brooklyns hoped to over
come Boston today that they might go
back and face the home folks with an
even break with the champion Amer
ican Leaguers.
"If we can spilt eyej} with Boston
on their own lot," said Captain Dau
bert, "there will be no hold up."
Manager Bill Carrigan admits that
Boston is not going to have a walk
away.
"Brooklyn carries a punch/' he re
marked, "and a game with them is
never over until the laat man Is out. I
think, tho, that we have the pitchers
to stop them."
Toward game time the sky became
overcast with thunder heads that
threatened showers. The weather was
hot and sticky. The ball players, how
ever, found the day to their liking, es
pecially the outfielders, who on Satur
day lost the ball in the glare of the
sun.
The crowd came late to the game but
there were early estimates tha^jmore
than 30,000 persona would witness the
'game. *•*'.*.
Shifts Made
in-
Lineup.
The players, having rested Over Sun
day, appeared )n good shape. 'The
teams were changed fron. the' com
binations that opposed each other in
the first game, batteries being drawn
upon for fresh strength and other
shifts dictated by known weaknesses
for probable improvement among in
dividuals.
With a game already to the credit of
the Red Sox, Manager Carrigan had an
advantage. Wllbert Robinson, manager
of the Brooklyns, when asked'' who
would pitch today, replied:
"I have told Coombs, Cheney, Pfef
fer and Smith that I will have the man
who shows the best form In practice
pitch this game."
Miller Is Receiving Choice.
Miller, however, was conceded the
catching assignment well In advance.
Carrigan had the better material to
pick form, In the opinion of the en
thusiasts. Ruth, Leonard and Mays
were available to him, but It was pre
dicted Ruth would be the choice.
President J. J. Lannln, of the Red
Sox, said he did not know who would
pitch but predicted it would be Ruth.
Red Sox players looked for Coombs
to oppose them, and "Chick" Shorten
sharpened his batting eye in readness
to play. Walker's efficiency against left
handed pitchers has Its complement in
Shorten's success against those who
pitch their right hands.
Brooklyn also had in its scheme of
campaign a change of fielders oh a
basis of batting strength, hy which
Stengel was to give way to Johnston,
a better batter against left handed
service.
Lineup For Today's Game.
The lineup:
Brooklyn Johnston, right Held
Daubert, first base Myers, center
field Wheat, left field Cutshaw, sec
ond base Mowrey, third base Olson,
shortstop Miller, catcher Smith,
pitcher.
Boston—Hooper, right field Janv
rln, second base Walker, center field
Hoblltzel, first base Lewis, left field
Gardner, third base Scott, shortstop
Thomas, catcher Ruth, pitcher.
Umpires—Dineen (American League)
behind the plate Qulgley, (National
League) on the bases Connolly,
(American League) right field O'Day,
(National League) left field.
As on Saturday, the early ^crowds
today were small compared to the
numbers that have been on hand In
former years. Less than, a score spent
the night at the gates. It Is estimated
the crowd would approximate 36,00(1
odd persons, Saturday's crowd.

Orders Given to Captains of Some
Line Ships to Remain in Port Until
Further Order*—Many Freighters in
Danger Zona, Some of Them Laden
With Ammunition Marine Inaur
ance and Stook Markete Affeoted.
New York, Oct 9.—Owners, agents
and others Interested in vessels near
the Atlantic coast flying the flags of na
tions hostile to Germany passed an un
easy night and today sought every ave
nue of news of their ships.
Many of the vessels within the U
boat dancer zone are carrying scores of
American and European passengers, in
cluding some notables in financial, busi
ness, theatrical and social circles.
It seemed doubtful today that the
submarine raid would result in a gen
eral tie-up In shipping of entente na
tions In American ports but one of the
most Important companies, the Interna
tional Mercantile Marine Company, is
sued orders that no British ships of that
line should leave Atlantic ports pending
further orders.
This order stopped the sailings of all
steamers of the White Star, Atlantic
Transport, Leyland, Dominion and Red
Star Uhes and vessels of the White
Star-Dominion line sailing from Mon
treal and Quebec. The order will not
interfere with any of the vessels under
the American flag.
Avoiding Armed Vessels.
Officials of the Cunard, French and
Italian lines declared that their passen
ger and freight vessels would sail as
usual. All Cunard vessels, it was
pointed out are armed with 4.7 Inch
guns and the German submarines have
thus far avoided vessels so armed.
The Alaunis, of the Cunard line,
sailed from here Saturday, after word
had been received of the arrival of the
U-53.
The French liners carry 8.5 inch guns
and the freight boats carry 3 Inch rapid
fire cannon. The ateamers under the
Italian flag mount 3 Inch guns. Dan
ger from submarine attacks on the
American coast is less than In the war
aone of European ports, officials said.
Many Freighters tn Danger Zone.
More -than a score of passenger and
freight steatosis are bellev^l today'£o
be near Nantucket Many arp believed
to be laden with war munitions.
The Anchor liner Cameronia is due
here today from Liverpool with 600
passengers. Wireless warnings were
sent to the captain yesterday directing
him to look out for the U-53.
The French liner Espagne is due to
arrive tonight, or tomorrow from Bor
deaux, bringing a number of Americans,
it was said.
The steamer Frederick VIII, of the
Scandinavian American line, which is
bringing home James W. Gerard, the
American ambassador to Germany, and
Mrs. Gerard, was 600 miles east of New
York at noon yesterday.
All the vessels destroyed by the sub
marines have been identified, except
possibly the "Kingston." She is believ
ed to be a British paddle steamer built
for the Great Lakes trade. She was
of 2,925 tons.
Marketa Affected.
Marine Insurance rates today jumped
1 to 6 per cent owing to the German
submarine activities'. Rates to Havre
and Bordeaux Increased from and
of 1 per cent to 5 per cent.
The stock market was thrown Into a
state of panic at today's opening in con
sequence of activities of German sub
marines in American waters. Promi
nent stocks, particularly the war group,
declined 5, 10 and in a few instances
nearly 20 points. After the most excit
ing half hour seen In the stock market
since the panic of 1907, the liquidation
was stemmed by a heavy volume of
buying orders.
Recoveries ranged from 4 to 8 points
while Republic Steel virtually regained
its 18 point decline. Sales in the first
hour reached the unprecedented total ot
approximately 900,000 shares.
Some brokers were asking for trans
Atlantic Insurance as high as 10 per
cent.
To South America and the Panama
canal rates advanced from of 1
per cent to 2 per cent
Tho advance was the biggest In rates
since that which followed the news of
the raids of the Moewe, in the South
Atlantic.

ii
No 'Reeaon aa Yet to Doubt Promisee
Will be Fulfilled—Allied Warahipa
•May Drive Submarines to NewFields.
Long Branch, N. J., Oct. 9.—Presi
dent Wilson announoed today as a re
sult of the German submarine attacks
on vessels oft the American coast that
"the German government will be held
to the fulfillment ot Its promises to tho
government of the United States." He
added he had no right now to question
Germany's willingness to fulfill the
promises.
President Wilson early today waa
still without information giving
grounds for fears that aerlous inter
national trolble might arise from the
German submarine raid. It was feared
the Germans might cause the loss of
American lives aud ships—Just as a
Norwegian and Dutch vessel were sunk
yesterday.
Count von Bernstorff was to confer
with the president this afternoon on a
letter from the German emperor In re
gard to Polish relief.
Just before Count von Bernstorff
called, Mr. Wilson Issued the following
statement:
'The government will, of oourse,
first Inform itself as to all the facts
that there may be no doubt or mistake
as far as they are concerned. The
country may rest assured that the Ger
man government will be held to the
fulfillment of Us promises to the
United States."
Rulee of War Not Violated.
Washington, Oct. 9. Complications
from the German submarine raids on
the Atlantic coast seem to point to the
allies as well as Germany.
American officials found no reaaon
today to ohange their belief that the
operations thus far had been aooordlng
to the rulea of war, but there la danger
of the destruction of an American ahip
carrying contraband and that might
easily cause another Ftye case and re
open the whole submarine question.
The threatened complication with
the"allies lies In the contention thai
submarines should be excluded from
all neutral ports. Today's London dis
patches quote the Manchester Guar
dian to the effect that such a view has
"been set out In the~recent memoran
dum sent by the allies to neutral gov
ernments." This is the first intima
tion here that anything in the nature of
a formal representation had been
made.
Position of United 8tstes.
The position of the United States
has been to decide on its merits the
case of eaoh submarine entering an
American port. Inasmuch as the Ger
man submersible which entered New
port took no supplies and asked for
no privilege^ it is not thought that she
raised any issue.
The general opinion today was that
with the gathering of allied cruisers o(T
the New England coast the submarines
would desert that field and strike their
next blows farther south. Some offl
clals expected to hear of operations in
the Gulf of Mexico, where the sub
mersibles could strike at the fleet of
tank 8temers carrying fuel oil to the
British navy from the Mexican fields,
upon which the British depend almost
entirely.
The oplotvbgkasrttgon ET E ET
Tho opinion that thero are several
submarines accompanied by a supply
ship, has been strengthened by the de
velopments.
The navy department began today
preparations to establish a patrol of
warships on the Atlantic coast to de
termine where rules uf warfare ass
violated by German submarines.
No Law Violated, 8aya Daniela.
Asbury, N. J., Oct 9.—Secretary of
the Navy Daniels in a report to Presi
dent Wilson today said that advlcea so
far received indicated that all the rules
of international warfare hod been com
piled with by German submarines oper
ating off the New England coast
U. 8. Too Neutrsl.
London, Oct. 9. The Manchester
Guardian in an editorial article on the
exploits of the U-58 declares its con
viction of the desire of the United
States to observe strict neutrality. The
Guardian says that tf the British am
basfndor protested against the entry of
the submarine into American waters
and argued that any further submarine
arriving should be interned for the rest
of the war, he would be expressing.the
attitude of the allied governments.
"The American government" says
tho paper, "apparently does not share
this view, or not fully, or It would not
have escorted the submarine into port
nor allowed it to leave."
ANTILLA TOWED TO PORT.
Burning Veesel Reaehee Cape Charie^

Newport News, Va., Oct 9.—The
Ward liner Antlila, which was afire oS
Cape Henry last night, reached the

ed at Old Point The burning vessel
