Local Longshoremen's Strike Settlement a Failure.?
WILSON SAYS HE WILL HOLD

Doubt us to whether I lie

pressed along the ivutei fn.ni
Monday.
Although announcement was
made In Seattle last week that a
satisfactory agreement had been
reached between employers and
workers on Puget Sound, it Is re
ported in Tacoma now that the
•trike has no more appearance of
being over than It has at any time
■ince its start in June.
Instead of discharging non
union longshoremen, it Is reported
that the docks and warehouses on
the Tacoma waterfront received
additional supplies of negro work
ers on Saturday and Sunday.
Not Back at Work.
At the longshoremen's head
quarters Monday It was an
nounced that the employers had
not yet called for any union work
ers, and that as yet not a single
union man had returned to work.
"All that I can say about the
strike is that we have withdrawn
all pickets, and arc ln a position
of 'watchful waiting' " was the
only statement of Secretary Au
gust Seitz.
lU,«< Lilian I in a*.*,.
It is reported from Seattle
Monday that Federal Mediator
Blackmail, who originated the an-
nnuncement that a settlement had
be. effected in the big strike,
was i.morning uneasy over the
failure of the employers and
workers to renoh a peaceful so
lution to the strike difficulties.
Tacoma longshoremen are re
ported to have agreed to wait
until Tuesday noon for the em
ployers to offer them a chance
to return to their Jobs on the
docks.
What action will be taken If
no move is made by the employ
ers Tuesday Is not predicted by
the union men.

In the first inning.
For Boston another long dis

first run when Scott cracked a
triple to left ln the third inning.
Cutshaw then made a costly bob

when the isssue was finally set
