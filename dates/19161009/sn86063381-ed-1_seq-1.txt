(Former University of Minnesota
Quarterback)
The Bemidji high school football
eleven defeated Akeley high at the
athletic grounds Saturday afternoon
in a bitterly fought game by a score
of 36 to 0.
The rain of the forenoon and early
afternoon kept many enthusiasts
away from the game, but the small
number that did attend were treated
to some real football.
Last year Akeley defeated Bemidji
10 to 0 and the visitors were deter
mined to make it two straight.
The Bemidji eleven worked in
more machine-like form than in the
previous two games and got their
plays off faster. The tackling, too.
was more sure and deadly. It is hard
to pick any one individual star in
Saturday's game for every one of the
locals gave a good account of him
self both on the offense and defense.
