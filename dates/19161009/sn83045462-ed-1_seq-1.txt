BRAVES FIELD. Boston, October 9 ?
The Boston Americans, with one victory
notched in their bat handles, met
the Brooklyn Nationals here this afternoon
in the second game of the world
series. The National League pennant
winners hoped to overcome the Bostons
today that they might go back and
face the home folks on their own ball
yard with an even break with the
champion American Leaguers.
"If we can split with the Red Sox
on their own grounds," said Capt. Jake
L>aubert of the Brooklyn# today,
"there will be no holding us when we
get back home. Every one knows that
we do our best work on our own diamond.
but that is not saying we expect
things to be easy for us at Ebbets
Field, for the Red Sox won their penriant
on the road and put up a stiff
game wherever they play."
Carrigan Respects Opponents.
Manager Bill Carrigan admits that
the Bostons are going to have no walkaway.
"The Brooklyns carry a punch,"
remarked Manager Carrigan. "and the >
game with them is never over until I
the last man is out. I think, though, i
\ye have the pitchers to stop them."
Toward game time the sky became
overcast with thunderclouds that gave a '
threat of showers. The weather was hot
and sticky. The ball players, however,
found the day to their liking, especially
the outfielders, who had often in Saturdays
game lost the ball in the glare of |
the sun that today was hidden behind
screening clouds.
The crowd came late to the game, and
there were early estimates that more than
30.000 persons would witness the sport.
Both Teams Practice Batting.
The Boston Red Sox put in some stifT
batting practice, with the left-hander, I
Pennock, on the mound. Afterward i
Manager Carrigan tested the batting I
sights of his players on the offerings j :
of WyckolT. a rlght-hancLer. As it grew J !
darker with the gathering clouds the J ,
managers of the two clubs began to : ,
look over their speed ball pitchers.
The Brooklyn supporters believed
that Cheney with his fast spit hall
would he Brooklyn's choice for moundsman.
It was noticed that Babe Ruth
took part in the hatting practice,
blanketed in a big red sweater, which
was taken to mean that he would be
found facing the visitors.

pitching star of the Brooklyn staff,

Brooklyn Shows Speed.
?
The Brook lyns showed speed and
brilliancy in their fielding practice,
Mowrey, Olson and Cutshaw turning
plays on difficult ground balls which
brought applause from the spectators.
An intermittent rain fell just before
the game. All the outfield stands were
filled and the indications were that a
larger crowd than on Saturday would
watch the game.
Babe Ruth and Carl Mays warmed
up for Boston, while Cheney. Coombs t
and Smith tried their whips out for :
Brooklyn. The Boston fielding prac- j
t?ce was snappy and bright. There was j
no sun to bother the fielders, and the j
outfielders ranged back and forth ;
without difficulty in gauging high flies.
The high sky and the glare of th~ v>n
on Saturday spoiled in a large measure
the outfield work of the two teams.

RUMANIANS DRIVEN
BACK BY TEUTONS
Bucharest Admits Retirement
to Passes of Carpathian
Mountains.
FOE TOO STRONG TO FACE
x>t_ v n.^ivriCM, uciuuer ?. \ la LiOnaon,
October 9.?In the face of far superior
forces, mainly German, the Rumanian
troops, from Herman nstadt to Brasso
(Kronstadt), have been withdrawn to
the Carpathian frontier, according to
the official communication from Rumanian
headquarters, to insure better
defense of the frontier passes.
"All evidence shows," says the statement,
"that the Austro-Germans are
bringing troops from all other fronts
in order to make a desperate coup in
this region. According to the latest
news the Rumanian offensive has already
been resumed in the Joul valley
and Caineni pass in the direction of
Herman nstadt."
The situation in Dobrudja is satisfactory,
according to the announcement.
and the Russians and Rumanians
are advancing southward.
Bumanians Had Weakened Line.
LOXyON, October 9.?According to
the Times corr>spondent at Rumania
headquarters, the Rumanian retreat
along the whole line in Transylvania,
except in the Maros valley, is due to
the fact that several divisions had
been taken from Transylvania for the
defense of Dobrudia. The arrival of
heavy Austro-German reinforcements
is also quoted as a factor.
The Rumanian forces now hold the
line from Predil pass, south of Brasso,
to Orsova and the intervening line of
lofty mountains, traversed by few defiles
and offering a strong natural defensive
front. North of Brasso the Rumanians
are still in the Maros valley
in touch with the Russian left
wing.
'It is undeniable," adds the correspondent.
"that the military situation
presents many difficult features for the
Rumanians, as they are fighting on
two fronts against seasoned troops
who are supplied with every modern
apparatus of war."
A Bucharest dispatch forwarded from
Rome to the wireless press, says the
Rumanians evacuated the Transylvanian
city of Kronstadt to avoid its destruction
by Austro-German batteries, which had
begun to fire on the town. The present
position of the Rumanian army is described
as excellent.
Teutons Recapture Kronstadt.
BERLIN, October S. via London, October
9.?The city of Kronstadt. in the
southeastern pari or j ransyivama, ana
Its leading: industrial and commercial
center, which was occupied by the Rumanians
shortly after their entry into
the war, has been recaptured by the
Austro-Gerraan forces, the war office
announced today.
All along the eastern line in Tran- :
sylvania, the official statement reports,
the Rumanians are falling- back. From
the Geister forest the Teutonic forces
have pressed into the Alt valley and
fought their way forward.
BIG BATTLE IS RAGING
ON THE RUSSIAN FRONT
Petrograd Reports the Czar's Forces
Have Pierced Teutonic Lines
in Volhynia.
PETROGRAD, October 9, via London,
1:50 p.m.?The great battle in Volhynia,
east of Vladimir-Volynski, is
continuing, the war office announced
today, and the Russians have succeeded
at some places in entering the Teutonic
lines. The positions taken have
been consolidated, the statement adds.
In the Brzezany region, southeast of
Lemberg. the Austro-German forces
have assumed the offensive, but were
stopped in their attacks by the Russian
lire. Ari Austrian advanced trench in
this sector was taken, says the official
report.

The District's legal machinery was
placed in full operation today. The recess
of the courts taken last Monday
out of respect to the memory of Justice

were called in each of the
courts.
The absence of Justice Gould prevented
the swearing in of the grand
jury and the arraignment of a number

Justice Gould will probably select a
I foreman tomorrow and the grand jury
J will then begin its deliberations.

Wall Street Witnesses Memorable
Scenes When Prices
Break as Much as 20 Points.
j INDUSTRIALS SUFFER MOST
NEW YORK. October 9.?Wall street
this morning witnessed scenes that have
not been repeated in this market since the
memorable days when Northern Pacific
preferred sold at $1,000 a share, and one
of the best bull markets that the street
has ever known was knocked into a
cocked hat.
Prices broke 10 and even 20 points
throughout the great list of stocks.
Even- brokerage house was crowded
j with spectators and speculators before
the hour for the opening was reached;
telegraph operators from all over the
country were loading the wires with selling
orders ; brokers* sheets were covered
with commissions on the selling side and
but an occasional buying order.
The fact that the selling orders were at
fhf> m u i-L-ot onH r tr\t u.itV> r*ri<-A limits
developed with the tap of the opening bell,
for values faded away as order after order
developed the selling pressure. Brokers
continued urgent demands for more
margins and tired bulls threw their stocks
overboard with recklessness.
Industrials Hard Hit.
The industrials were harder hit than
the railroads, but even the standard
rails?Pennsylvania, Union Pacific and
Heading?did not escape the flood of
selling.
It is more than likely that it would
have been a bear day under any circumstances,
the leading interests of
the market being <01 that side, many1
large houses refusing to permit the
general public to carry the market to
higher levels or continue their absorption
of stock.
But every one accredited the selling
to the sensation of the day?the work
A>f the undersea boats on the Atlantic
coast.
For the first hour the selling continued
unabated. The sold-out bulls,
who have been waiting for just such
an opportunity, made large purchases,
and many bears who had been working
a ?ac ion turned to cover, this
( heincr the onlv check to the slumping

and on the advance profittaking
was in evidence.
900,000 Shares in First Hour.
In the first hour over 900,000 shares

Crucible Steel, 8%.
In the rails losses also were severe,

Southern Railway, 2, ar?d Union Pacific,

losses mark the culmination
of the weakness, and thereafter there
came sharp recoveries, aided by the
wiping out of many weak accounts, and
the return, me before stated, of sold-out

habilitate their holdings.
| Full recoveries were not held, for the
i reason that many speculators took
I their profits and left the market.

LAMBROS TO HEAD
A GREEK CABINET
Friendliness to Entente Powers
Will Be Required of
Ministers.
ATHENS, October 8, via London, October
9.?Prof. Lambros has agreed to
undertake the formation of a cabinet,
which probably will include one or
two other university professors. He
declares the new ministry must be
separated wholly from the present
political strife. The ministers of war
and interior will be required to guarantee
that they will do all in their I
! power to compose the differences with
the entente powers and not to create
new points of friction.
In official quarters it is stated that
all the demands of the entente have
been complied with except those with
regard to the expulsion of Germanborn
Greek subjects, which are considered
by the Greek government as in
violation of the fundamental laws of
this country.
Deadlocked on Issue.
The entente powers maintain that as
German-born Greeks are not exempt
from military service in Germany by
Greek naturalization, they are not entitled
to any exemptions not granted
to other Germans in Greece. Negotiations
regarding these demands are at
deadlock.
Prof. Spyridon P. Lambros is the author
of many historical works, a member
of numerous learned societies and
occupant of the chair of history in the
University of Athens.
Entente naval authorities have seized
goods comprising the cargoes of Austrian
and German merchant vessels interned
in Greek waters.

This spot is right in the track of ;
transatlantic shipping, and, according j
to some of the survivors, the steamers i
came within range* of the submarines j
so fast that they could not all be sent j
to the bottom at once, and one had to j
be kept waiting while another was
disposed of.
That more than one submarine is j
operating is vouched for not only by
those who were aboard the ships sunk, j
but by officers and men of the United |
States destroyers that went out and |
brought in the survivors. Officers and ,
men on the United States destroyer j
Balch declared that they saw a Ger- j
man supply ship, and men on the destroyer
Ericsson say i hat they saw
several German submarines while they
were picking up the survivors.
The U-53, which came into Newport !

ships while the L'-fil sent the Stephano !
of the Halifax line, on which were i
the American passengers, to the bottom.

The Stephano was not torpedoed, as
was first reported, but after the crew

Sixteen United States destroyers have |

thus far to find any of them, but it is
not believed they lost their lives, because
all of them got to their lifeboats

there is doubt in the minds of naval
officers that one of the engines of destruction
was the German 17-53 which
delivered npiil for the German ambassador
Count Bernstorff at Newport yesterday.
The belief is growing that the
U-53 is only one of a flotilla of German
submarines gathered for attacks on
vessels of the allied nations and neutral
bottoms carrying contraband of
war. Their operations, so far as
known, have been south and southeast
of Nantucket Island, and from three to
ten miles off shore.
Shipping at ports along the New
England coast had been held up" to a
greater extent today and vessels at sea
were reported making for the nearest
harbor. The sudden onslaught of underseas
craft had thoroughly terrified;
shipping interests engaged in the oar- j
rying of munitions of war and other!
shipping not flying the American flag. |
The American steamer Kansan. which i
was held up by a submarine off Nan- !
tucket at 4:30 o'clock yesterday morn-i
ing, arrived here today. Her captain ]
said that he had turned back in response
to the signals of distress from'
the West Point, but finding that his as-t
sistanee was not required he proceeded
to Boston.
The richest prize bagged by the Germans
yet was the passenger liner
Stephano, which had just rounded the'
east end of Nantucket when she fell
prey to a submarine. The vessel, British
owned, was on her regular trip
from St. Johns. Newfoundland, to New
York via Halifax, and carried eierhtv
throe passengers. including th^ty
Americans. Twenty-six of the latter
were making the round trip on the
steamer from New York. The Stephano
was valued at $400,000 when she was
launched, three years ago. She carried
also a cargo of codfish, codfislt oil and
seal oil consigned to parties in the
I'nited States and South America, and
valued at $150,000. Her naval value
was due to the fact that she had been
sold to the Russian government and
was soon to he used as an ice. breaker.

When the Red Cross liner, in command
of Capt Smith, touched here at
noon Saturday five Americans went
aboard. A revised passenger list shows

i the Nantucket lightship today
: three vessels sunk had not been

vicinity where the. vessels were
commander was satisfied that she was
an American vessel he allowed her to
proceed.
The submarine then moved in close
to the lightship, where at '? a.m. she
stopped the British steamerStrathden**,
bound from New York for Bordeaux.
After the crew had obeyed orders to
take to the ship's boats the submarine
sent a torpedo into the Strathdene and
sank her. The raider, patrolling the
vicinity of the transatlantic steamship
lane, moved considerably to the southward.
At 10:4". a.m. she hailed the
British steamer West i'oint. Ixindon f
for Newport News, with a warning
shot. This was at a point ten miles
south of the lightship. The crew took
to the boats and the submarine torpedoed
and sank the steamer.
No other vessel was encountered until
late in the afternoon. At 4 :.';o p.m., six
miles southeast of the lightship the
German stopped the Stephano. Passengers
and crew were taken ofl in the
ship's boat:*, and the undersea boat
shot a torpedo into the liner. As this did
not appear to disable the stanch steel
vessel, it was supplemented by gunlire.
The submarine moved off v ithout waiting
for the Stephano to sink, and she
remained atloat until o'clock last
night.
Near sunset the British steamer Kingston
came within view of the lookout
i on the submersible. The same procedure
was folio ved as with the other
vessels, and at t; p.m. the Kingston
went down a short distance southeast
of the lightship.
Took Advantage of Moonlight.
The bright moonlight gave the submarine
a good chance to continue operations
in the evening. She moved a
little to the westward, and soon after
dark stopped the Dutch tramp steamer
Bloomersdijk, bound from New York
I for Rotterdam, three miles south of the
'lightship. Supposedly on the theory
that she was carrying contraband, the
steamer was sunk after the crew had
rine left her still afloat, but she went
down at 8p.m.
little later the Norwegian steamer
Christian Knudsen. New York for Dondon,
was similarly halted and sent to
the bottom. Three other steamers were
reported sunk early today. The Kansun
meanwhile had sett broadcast
radiograms telling of the submarine's
appearance in the vicinity of the lightship.
The West Point was also able to flash
off brief messages giving word of her
plight before she was abandoned by
her crew. These dispatches were picked
up at Newport and a fleet of United
States torpedo boat destroyers was immediately
ordered out to pick up the
crews.
Throughout the day and night the destroyers
cruised in the waters for sevveral
miles around the Nantucket lightship,
receiving word from time to time
of the sinking of additional vessels.
They located the survivors of all the
vessels known to have been destroyed
except the Kingston and took them
aboard. The crew of the Strathdene
had previously been* given shelter on
the lightship.
Not Mentioned in Maritine Lists.
The steamer Kingston- is not mentioned
in maritime records and her destination
was not known early today.
No legendary "Flying Dutchman"
ever was the center of so much
mystery or the cause of so much speculation
or lived so true to the tradition
of being the forerunner of marine inis
haps as the uerman war ouumauno
U-53, which dropped* so dramutlcally
into Newport harhor Saturday afternoon.
Capt. Hans Hose, her commander.
said that he was seventeen
days out from Wilhelmshaven and had
come in to mail a letter to Ambassador
von Bernstorff. There was an exchange
of visits between him and
American naval officers. Visitors were
allowed to board the submersible, to look
at her two guns?one mounted forward
and the other aft?and to gaze upon
the eight grim torpedoes stored beneath
the forward deck. Professional
sea lighters of the United States Navy
and mere landlubbers were alike given
ample opportunity to see that the submarine
was no phantom.
Her stay in port was scarcely more
than three hours. She took on no fuel,
no food, no water, not even a pipeful
of tobacco. "VVe have ample supplies
of all we want," said her officers.
At dusk she pointed her nose out of
the harbor and in the deep water off
Brentons reef lightship submerged, and
for a few hours all trace of her was
lost.
In diplomatic circles there w as at once
a flurry of speculation as to the message
Capt. Rose had mailed to Ambassador
von Bernstorff. Naval officers
speculated as to the remarkable cruising
possibilities of the submersible
which perlnitted lier to make so long
and so difficult a voyage through
enemy-controlled seas without need of
supplies of any nature.
Shippers of munitions to the allies
speculated uneasily as to the purpose
and probable length of stay of the
powerful undersea raider in the center
of the great trade route from Atlantic
coast ports to Europe. Speculation
even touched upon the rumor, impossible
to run down, that the U boat
was made in America, that her parts
were assembled at a secret base on
this side of the Atlantic and launched.
Reports of Marine Caches.
The rumor broadened to include reports
that stores of petrol and other
supplies l&d been spirited out of American
ports and deposited in marine
caches.
The silence as to the actual wheieibouts
of the submersible was just
ong enough for the full effect of her
ippearance to take hold of the public
magination. Then came thft second
