AMERICANS ABOARD ONE
LINER; NO LIVES LOST
Destroyers, Rushed from Newport,
Bring in 256 Persons?One Report
Is That Many Are Missing.
(From a Staff Correspondent of The Tribune.)
Newport, R. I., Oct. 8.?Nine unarmed merchant vessels, one a passen
ger ship with Americans aboard, were sent to the bottom to-day by one or
more German submarines within a radius of thirty miles of Nantucket
Lightship. The liner, the Stephano, of the Red Cross Line, and the Strath
dene were torpedoed. The others were sunk by gunfire or explosives, or
were scuttled by boarding parties.
Two other submarines aided the U-53.
One was a Dutch ship, one a Norwegian, the others were British.
Two hundred and fifty-six survivors, including thirty-five women and ten diilciren,
reached Newport Harbor late to-night on United States destroyers, which put to sea
when word came of the first sinking. The Ericsson has eighty-one, among them all the
women and children; the Drayton, sixty-eight; the Benham, thirty-six, and the Jenkins,
seventy-one.
An officer of the Drayton declared that many were missing.
It was at first believed, due to the fact that all the attacks were made within a few
miles of the Nantucket Shoals Lightship, that only one submarine was at work. That
one was naturally thought to be the U-53, which gained its fame by cruiser-sinking ex
ploits in the Dardanelles and its latest glory by calmly popping up in Narragansett Bay,
off Newport, yesterday.
But it was authoritatively stated to-night that at least two submersikles had been
at work. Captain Blanchard, of the lightship, which is anchored thirty miles off the east
coast of Nantucket Island, 100 miles from here, wirelessed that the U-boats had operated
so close to his station that he had been able to make out two of them. One, naval
officers of the Newport station have no doubt, is the U-53.
The ships destroyed were:
STRATHDENE, British freighter, 4,321 tons; New York for Bordeaux.
WEST POINT, British freighter, 2,413 tons; London for Newport News.
STEPHANO, British passenger ship, 2,143 tons; Newfoundland for New York.
KINGSTON, British freighter; destination unknown.
BLOOMERSDIJK, Dutch steamship, 3,201 tons; New York for Rotterdam.
CHRISTIAN KNUDSEN, Norwegian tank steamer, 2,5?83 tons; New York for
London.
So far as known, not a life was lost, though the crew of the Kingston is not ac
counted for. When the United States steamship Kansan first flashed the word that the
war had crossed the Atlantic destroyers all along the coast were ordered prepared to sail
at a moment's notice. The Kansan, which carried a cargo of steel for the Italian govern?
ment, was stopped, but allowed to proceed.
From 6 o'clock in the morning until long after the hunter's moon gathered brilliancy
in the dusk the U-boats sought their prey. They found it good hunting.
The Strathdene was the first. It was just 6 o'clock; the ship was off Nantucket.
Her crew took to the boats and made Nantucket Lightship while the U-boat sent the
freighter to the bottom with t
