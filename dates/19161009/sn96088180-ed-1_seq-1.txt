SUBMARINE STOPS
(
HoMton, Oct. A German sub
marine other thsn the V-r.3 halted
the Hawaiian-American stestner Kan
Sao, officer of the vessel declared on
reaching port here today. Their itate
ment, after viewing a photograph of
the U-61, taken during the latter'
hurried call at Newport Saturday, was
taken as conclusive proof tbst more
than one German submarine operated
off the New England coast over 8un
day. ;
After studying the photograph,
both officer and men aald the ship1'
hailing them was different and that
the men aboard were not the same
ss those depicted on the 17-51.
The submarine raider did not board
the Kansan. Instead, the German
captain hailed the vessel from deck,
after spotting her American flag, and
the V boat dropped out of sight Just
a abruptly a it had appeared, after
being ahown the Kanaan's paper and
having them examine.
Shipping men were surprised tbst
the Germane should have let the Kan
san go free, Inaamuch a her cargo
consisted or steel, hsy and grain from
New York for the French govern
ment at St. Naxalre.
. The Xaasan will take 1,000 horse
aboard here and aall again for the
French port. She was chartered aome
time ago by the French government.
She li or 15,000 tons. ,
The theory that there Is more than
one aubmarlne off the coast waa also
borne out by the story told by Cap
tain E. I.. Smith or the Kansan. Smith
declared he had hardly departed from
the II boat which held him up when
lie heard the call of the ateamer West-
point, saying abe had been fired upon.
THe Westpolnt was some distance
swsy. Captsln Smith said:
' "I left New York at 10 a. iu. Sat
urday and arrived three miles off the
Nantucket lightship at 4:35 Sunday
morning. The flrst warning 1 had that
a German aubmarlne was even in the
-vicinity waa when I heard a ahot fired
across the Ksnsan'a bow. 1 Immedi
ately ordered the engines atopped, but
before we could come to a standstill
there was a second shot. We came
to 'a atop within a few minutes. I
then sighted the submarine for the
llrt time. She was a short distance
sway and an officer hailed the Kansan
from the boat. He asked tor our
papers. I Immediately put over a
boat with Second Officer McNamara
In charge. He rowed to the submarine
and presented our papera. They were
carefully examined and McNamara
wa told we could proceed. An hour
after we were Brat stopped we were
under way again.
"Before wa had gone far, however,
the submarine disappeared beneath
the waves, diving out of sight as sud
denly aa she had appeared. We had
hardly left this V boat until I heard
the wireless call of the Westpolnt,
saying she wa being attacked by a
Bubmarlue, 1 put the Kansan about
and started to her asaUtance. Before
we had gone far we learned that the
I'nltod States destroyers were within
striking distance, so we changed our
course again and proceeded to Hon
ton." ' Captain Smith could not explain
how. the submarine commander hap
pened to permit htm to continue his
voyage. He udmltted tho Kansan whs
carrying contraband nnd was under
charter by the French government.

LOSER IN SUIT
In the circuit court thl morning
Judgment waa rendered against the
Rogue River Public Service corpor
ation and In favor of the city of
Grants Pax for $1,000, the amount
of the bond which tho Public Ser
vice people had given to guarantee
the fulfilment of the terms or a fraa
chise granted by the city. The Amer
ican 8urety company, through which
the bond wa given, was made a party
to the luit, and Judgment also la had
against this company, and it will be
called upon to produce the thousand.
The bond was entered Into at the
time the Public 8ervlce corporation
aought and was granted a rranchlse
for the construction of an elecrlc
lighting and power line within the
city. The term of the franchise and
the bond were that at least two miles
of line should be constructed within
the rlty by last April. Up to the pre
sent time no move toward the build
ing of the line has been made, and the
decree of the court Is that the com
pany has failed to meet Its obligation
and that the bond should be forfeited
and Judgment be had by the city. .
HUGHES ATTACKS
EIGHT-HOUR LAW
Newark. N. J.. Oct. . Candidate
Hughes loosed bta heaviest battery of
aaaault on the Adamson eight-hour
law here today in a speech Inaugur
ating hia third campaign trip. With
out ualng names, he Ironically para
phrased "Do not run away and dream
that you will have courage in a fu
ture day," In referring to what he said
waa the democratic administration's
."capitulation and humiliating sur
render to duress."
I It was the republican nominee's
tic settlement ot the railroad strike,
which in previous speeches he has
dubbed the "paramount" Issue ot the
campaign. He went Into great detail
to declare that the bill was not an
, eight-hour measure, but "a mere In
crease or wsges by flxlng a different
basis tor calculating wages."
He qiioted Senator Underwood as
.admitting the question "Is a question

nl-all work only eight hours, they
don't want that.'?
"Service over eight hours," Hughes
added, 'is not prohibited. It la not
penalised. On the contrary,
such work is evidently contemplated.
The railroad runs must be completed
In any case and, under this bill all
service over eight hours is simply to
he paid tor pro-rata. It ta therefore
wholly misleading to refer to this bill
as an eight-hour bill. . What
Is the purpose or this attempt to make
the public believe that this bill Axes
an eight-hour working day? Mani
festly In order to endeavor to Justify
this extraordinary action of the, ad-
ministration In Its abject and hu mi
litating surrender of principle in de-
tlon without any proper Inquiry as the
