MAKE EVERY DAY
FIRE PREVENTION
D AY-V71IITEF0RD
Drills and Special Program
Mark Observance,
Fire drills and special programs in
city and rural schools and parades in
several municipalities, marked the ob
servance today of "Fire Prevention
Day" in all parts of Oklahoma. The
day was set aside in a proclamation
issued by Governor Williams.
In Oklahoma City observance of the
occasion was left to the discretion of
the individual teacher. No set pro
grams were authorized either at the
high school or in the ward buildings.
"It :s my idea to make every day in
the year 'Fire Prevention Day,'" said
uperintendent J. A. Whiteford this
morning. "I have asked my teachers to
give instruction in fire prevention
whenever they can do so properly dur
ing history, geography, vicis and read
ing lessons. In a few schools fire
drills will be held.
"As for asking pupils to gather up
the rubbish around their buildings, it
is impressed upon them that they
should not scatter rubbish which must
later be disposed of."
C. C. Mammonds, state fire marshal,
some time ago sent a letter to offi
cers of public schools in all parts of
the state suggesting that fire preven
tio nbe studied in school in just such
a manner as regular studies. Owing
to last night's disastrous fire at Drum
right, and a recent conflagration at
Sulphur, he was unable to send speak
ers from his office. In many places,
however, special Instruction on she
subject will be given pupils.

Dead Are Not

Somme Fields
Rapidity of Fighting Prevents
Gathering Up Bodies;
"Tanks" Active.
BY FREDERICK PALMER.
WITH THF FRENCH ARMIES IN
FRANCE, Oct. 9-The entente allied
offensive north of the Somme has con
tinued with such rapidity that no op
portunity lias arisen to clear the bat
tlefield of the dead.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press was enabled to watch the French
troops when going Saturday to make a
fresh spring forward. The result of
this was the capture of territory over
a kilometer in depth and six kilome
ters (3-)4 miles) front which gave
them a commanding position in the
vicinity of Sailly-Saillsel and at the
same time possession of the Bapaume
road.
Behind the new line evidence abounds
of the severity of the fighting. Doens
of dead Germans lie in the trenches,
tons of military accoutrements, guns

close inspection outside and inside dem -
onstrates their invulnerability against

some safegusrd against even that.
HOTEL RATE BOOSTING
TO BtT PUT UNDER BAN
City Attorney Will Draft Ordinance
Providing for Standard
Prices.
1 lotels that charge exorbitant rates
during conventions and the State Fair
are to be regulated by city ordinances.
A. T. Boys, assistant city attorney, an
nounced today. An ordinance that will
force hotels to charge a standard rate
at all times, will be drafted and sub
mitted to the city commissioners at
an early date.
"During the recent tate Fair," Mr.
Boys said, "a great many visitors were
imposed upon by the smaller hotels.
Taking advantage of the crowded con
ditions, many hotel proprietors charged
$2 and even $J for rooms that ordina
rily rent for $1 a night.
"In my opinion a city ordinance that
would dictate hotel rates would not be
legal, but an ordinance prohibiting the
boosting of rates could be enforced. I
intend to draw un such an ordinance
as soon as possible."

Germany Must Keep Promises
LONG BRANCH, N. J., Oct. 9.-Piesident Wileon announced today
as the result of the German submarine attacks on vessels off the
American coast that "the German government will be held to the
fulfilment of its promises to the government of the United States." He
said he had no right now to question Germany's willingness to fulfil the
promises.
Just before Count von Bernstorff, the German ambassador, called on
the president at Shadow Lawn this afternoon Mr. Wilson issued the fol
lowing etatement:
"The government will, of course, first inform itself as to all the facta
that there may be no doubt or mistakes as far as they are concerned.
"The country may rest assured that the German government will be
held to the complete fulfilment of its promises to the government of the
United States. I have no tight now to question its willingness to fulfil
them."
WASHINGTON. Oct. 9. The navy department began today preparationa
to establish a patrol of warships along the north Atlantic coast to make certain
that American neutrality is not violated by the German submarine raid on

Possibilities of diplomatic complications over the German submarine activ
ittes along the New Lngland coast seemed to point toward the allies as well as
Germany.
Officials, scanning the unofficial reports of the destruction of ships within
of American shores, found no reason today to change their first impression
that the submarine operations had been
of international law.

that with the gathering of allied cruis
