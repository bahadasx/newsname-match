NUMBER 9048.
WOMEN AND BABIES, U-BOAT VICTIMS,
SAVED AFTER DRIFTING HOURS AT SEA
It LEADERS
STILL IN DOUBT
AS TO HURLERS
But Critics Pick Coombs and
Ruth to Work in Today's
Game.
CHENEY MAY BE ELECTED
BOSTON, Oct. 9. Doubt still
existed early this afternoon as to.
who would be selected to perform
on the mound for the Red Sox and
Dodgers in 'the second game of the
world's series today.
Manager Robinson for the Dodg
ers had not made up his mind as
between Coombs and Cheney, and
Carrigan' had not announced defin
itely which one of his flingers he
would start.
PICK COOMBS AND RUTH.
Several critics, who claim to be among
those who know, protest that Larry J
to the Red Sox, but Coombs appeared
more likely.
Coombs' past world's scries experi
ence, his knowledge oC the same, and
the successes he has had all point to
him as the real candidate.
Babe Ruth is conceded to be Bill Car
rlgan'a beat bet, and he Is expected to
assume the mound duties for the Bos
ton Red 8ox.
Although defeated In the Initial con
tent, confidence has come to the Brok
Jyn camp. That ninth inning Saturday
has shown the Dodgers that Boston
pitchers are not beyond being hit, and
they arc primed to go after anything the
Sox have to offer.
Earlv today the weather man was
threatening to take a hand In affairs.
The day broke with clouds and fog and
a small rain helped along the gloom.
Later, however, the sun appeared.
Confidence among the Brooklyn play
ers Is born of the grand flnale In Sat
urday's nlnth-lnnlng when four Brook
lyn runs sent Shore beating It for his
street clothes.
Can Hit Pitchers.
Smothered on their first world's series
conflict, bewildered by an attack and
defense which left their hends swim
ming, the Dodgers discovered with
quite n bit of surprise that they can hit
Boston American League twirling with
almost as much eclat and gusto as the
National League kind.
Their bats giriv decidedly menacing
to the Boston aspirations In that final
chapter, and they will go Into this sec
ond fray eager for a chance to get a
crack at some more of Bill Carrigan's
stars.
It might be remembered that throe
members of the Dodger wrecking crew
were not implicated In the attack which
routea Bnore. tenner v neat, uauuen,
nor Cutshaw hit safely In the wind-up.
although each of these maulers had a
chance.
In fact, Daubert and Cutshaw went
through the afternoon blowless. If the
Dodgers can accumulate ton hits with
these "bludgeon-wlclders unconscious so
far as all batting purposes are con
cerned, there is no telling what will
happen when they get going.
Tactics of Rival Clubs.
The tactics of the two clubs today
should prove a fan-killing feature. In
the first squaring off of the rival hordes.
Brooklyn's game was a wide open, hit
and run, smash or get smashed. On the
other hand, the Red Sox adroitly worked
men to basts, ahead to another by a
sacrifice and then endeavored to drive
them home by clean hitting.
Every run was worked for. Not a man
was wasted when once ho reached a
base. Other clubs have found this sys
tem poor against the Dodgers, and the
Red Sox surely passed through a burn
ing moment In that ninth inning.
Consequently, it will be Interesting to
observe Its success In another effort.
Betting was absolutely quiet In the
morning hours today. Likewise the
crowd was stubbornly quiet. An
nouncement that the tickets were to be
placed on sale at Braves Field, some
grandstand admissions Included, did not
create any mad dash 'for that vicinity.
Betting odds still favored tho Red Sox.
and they were being quoted at 2 to 1
in some places on the series. Betting
tightened on the outcome of the dav's
game when the spectators began to fig
ure that Jack Coombs would face the
home guard. Bets were being placed at
10 to 6 and 10 to 7 on this conflict.

ment "will be held to the complete fulfillment of its promises
to the Government of the United States," President Wilson
said today in a statement, to the American people, upon the

The statement follows :

States. I have no right to question their willing
ness to fulfill them.

I
Has Already Declared Against
Receiving Submarines
and
Will Stand Pat.
Contrary to the belief which has
hitherto prevailed, tho British govern
ment will not make a protest to this
Government against the l'-M being al
lowed to enter Newport and depart as
an ordinary warship.
This statement was made today on
high authority close to the British em
bassy. It waa stated that Great Britain would
not rush In with a protest now, because
It had already clearly defined to this
Government Its viewa relative to sub
marines. It Is already on record against
submarines being tteated In accordance
with the usual practices which apply to
ordinary warships.
That being the case. It Is understood
the British government will simply
stand pat.
The view of the British' government
Is that It Is up to the President of tho
I'nlted States to assent to the British
view or to tefuse to do so.
Whether later on the Brlteh govern
ment will put In claims for vessels de
stroyed off the coast of this country Is
another matter. However, theie Is no
parallel between the case of the U-63
which put Into Newport and got no
supplies or equipment, and hurried out
again, and the case In which France
held Spain to account for the destruc
tion of a French vessel by a German
craft, which had Just come out of a
Spanish port.
In the latter Instance, as understood
here, the German craft remained for a
considerable time and was provisoned.
Secretary of State Lansing officially
announced today that tho I'nlted

TWO U-BOftTS
OFF U.S. COAST
Stcphano Passenger Says She
Saw U-61 on Submersible
Which Sank Ship.
NINE VICTIMS NOW RUMORED
BOSTON. Oct. 9. A German subma
rine, other than the U-53. halted the
Hawaiian-American steam Kansan,
officers of that vessel declared on
reaching port here todayr
Their statement, after viewing a
photograph of the U-SS taken during
the letter's hurried call at Newport
Saturday, was taken as conclusive
proof that more than one German
submersible operated off the New
Kngland coast over Sunday
After studying the photograph, both
officers and men said the ship hailing
them was different and that the men
aboard were not tho same as those
depicted on the U-83.
The submarine raider did not board
the Kansan. Instead, the (Irrmin
captain hailed the vessel from deck,
aftor spotting her American flag, and
the U-boat ducked out of sight lust
aa abruptly as It had appeared, after
being shown the Kaiisan's papers and
having them explained.
A dispatch from a I'nlted Presa staff

-Maihitrii UiUon. ot Wllllamitown,

was a Passenger on the Stephano, said
she looked at the submarine through

saw. As the .lighting submarine which
i'ui in hi .i!Woii was tile 1-53, this
would definitely account for two sub
mersible. At Nantucket a leport has been picked
up that two or thiee submarines ure In
action and that the number of ship sunk
Is now eight or nine.
The theory that there Is more than
one submarine oft the coast was also
borne out by the story told by Copt, K.

BERNSTORFF SEES
BENT
Chief Executive Takes Up Lat
est Developments in U-Boat
Issue With Him.
ASBl'RY PARK. N. X. Oct. 9.-Whcn
Piesident Wilson saw Ambassador von
Bernstorff at 1 o'clock today, he took
up In full the latest developments In the
submarine Issue between the two. gov
ernments.
In official circles, the situation was
regarded as fraught with ominous pos
slbllltles, but pending definite word
from von Bernstorff and from official
Government icportH. no conclusions
were ventured by officials hcie.
Ainbussador von Bernstorff arrived
heie earlier than was expected, succeed
ing In avoiding newspaper men.
All during the night and morning
telegraphers worked with Washing
ton to learn whether the Oilman C
boats had violated the pledges Riven
by the imperial government In the
past. But, It was not until noon that
Secretary Daniels telegruphed that
the rule established by the United
States had not veen violated.
The deepest anxiety over thp sit
uation was manifest, but official ac
tion and official comment were with
held In keeping with past rules not
to act without full facts.
Messages from the State and Navy
departments early today said these
branches were hard at work garner
ing Information and would rush It
through the moment It was obtained.
Count von Bernstorff's visit is assum
ed to be, as stated, for the purpose of
delivering Kaiser Wllhelm's answer to
the President's personal appeal for co
operation by European rulers to help
starving Poland.
Nevertheless, some saw In the visit
an extra significance In view of rumor
ed peace moves by Germany, as well as
the fact that Gentian raiders so spec
tacularly sank ships off the American
coast.
Lost Doll and Torn Hand
U-Boat Casualties
NEWPORT, R. I., Oct. 9. One
baby doll lost and one mother's
hand badly lacerated these
were the only casualties at
tending the sinking of the liner
Stephano by- a German subma
rine. As one of the small boats was
drawing away from the liner's
side, a little girl dropped her
doll overboard. She began
crying. Just as the mother
reached out to rescue the doll
a wave rolled the lifeboat
against the Stcphano and her
hand was crushed.

FOUR U.S. DESTROYERS
SAVE 216 PERSONS
FROM SUNKEN SHIPS
One Warship Alone Brings Fourteen Infaoti
In from Torpedoed Excursion Steamer;
Fear Felt for Kingston's Crew.
, NEWPORT, Oct. 9. Dripping with brine, which
stood out like sweat on their steel sides from prodigious ef
forts of rescuing passengers of six torpedoed merchant
ships, four United States destroyers arrived here before
dawn today, bringing the first stories of the European war
carried to America's doorstep.
While powerful searchlights flashed and whistles
sounded, the destroyer Ericcson the first to arrive nosed
her way back from the scene of operations of Germany's
U-boats, striking terror to shipping off the New England
coast.
The four destroyers arriving here carried rescued pas
sengers as follows: Ericcson, 81; Drayton, 68; Benham,
36; and Jensen, 31.
This accounted for the crews and passengers of all
ships sunk by the submarines except the .men from the
Kingston who have not yet been reported and about whose
safety grave fears are entertained.
NONE OF EIGHTY-ONE INJURED.
Of the eighty-one persons picke dup from small boats
by the Ericcson, not one was Injured. Practically all, how
ever, had lost all personal belongings.
They were without money or baggage of any descrip
tion. They had only the clothes whicji they wore.
For the first time in their lives, officers and men of
the Ericcson found bobbing on the water which had be
come the grave of the steamer Stephano, bound from St.
Johns to New York.
Many were sleeping peacefully in the arms of thetf
mothers or nurses as the lifeboats rolled and rocked with
the gentle swell of the sea.
DRIFTED ALL NIGHT. - "
Almost all, night long the boats had drifted.
Only1 the dinHight of a lantern in the life-saving craft
and the soft rays of the mooh, shifting intermittently
through .the clouds, served to light trie scene, which but a,
fe whours before haU been. one of America's peace.
The passe.ngers of the Stephano took to the small boalto
at 6:30 yesterday evening. They were adrift until about
2:30 this.morning.
The United Press correspondent was the only news1
paper man permitted aboard the destroyer Ericsson.
When she dropped anchor Admiral Gleaves, com
manding the destroyer flotilla, ordered health officers aboard
to examine passengers and crew from the Stephano.
The youngest passenger aboard was little brown-eyed
Warren Driscoll, of St. Johns. Warren is four months old.
With thirteen other babies he is safe ashore today after an
experience the thrill of which may never be repeated though
he may live to be a gray-haired man.
LOST EVERYTHING SHE OWNED.
Miss Elizabeth Butler, of St. Johns, telling of her ex
perience, said:
"I lost everything I owned except what I've got on.
My God, it was awful!
"We had just sat down to supper when suddenly we
heard a shot. Some one called that the ship had(been fired
upn. Then I heard the captain yell to everyone to get
their Hfe-preservers on. I went below decks and put on i
coat and a life preserver."
A. C. Tickell, chef of the Stephano, celebrated his third
submarine sinking.
He was on the troop ship Marquette when she was sunk
without warning in the Dardanelles.
Shortly after this Tickell was on the troop ship Manitou.
which -was sunk off Malta by a German submarine. The
chef was wounded. Tickell's only remark today was:
"What difference do a few submarines make? What
the h do I care for submarines?"
This last femark of Tickell's might stand as express
ing the attitude of practically all of the passengers and
