prouklyn, nothing daunted by Us
l. al el' Saturday, is reiariiiK to re
verse tile decision ill Monday's game.
The weather forci list for tomorrow
;s fur it clear day.
" Those who witnessed the opening
pkty claim to have seen nothing that
iiriiiisctl fear that tile record of un
liinkeii vleloricM in past world's se
ries is to he upset this season. TIley
are willing to eoneede that the Hrook
lyn tciim is a Kame, hard-working
nr,uii of players, hut contend that
there is larking the. smooth, maclune
like effectiveness of Huston. They
strengthen their opinions by willing
ness to wager two lo one on; the nut
teinc of the .series.
Neither team practiced today.
The chief topic of conversation and
n i ii rut-lit among fans Was based upon
the dunce of pitchers for tomorrow's
Maine. It was the concensus of opin
ion that Carrian would send either
Kuth or Leonard to the mound for
liiiMnn. while Kobinson would coun
ter with either Coombs or ITeffer.
Jn either ease. Huston will have it
suiilliiiaw in the box against the Su
iuV.. vrhllv. Jhtston will e ealleii
upon to face a right bander, since
lii Doklyn played its best left handed
I wirier when Mimimirtl was worked
en Saturday.
There is a wide difference of opin
ion alining; baseball magnates here re
garding the reason for the falling off
in nltendaiice at Saturday's contest,
us compared with the games played
here a year ago, there being six thous
and less than the opening game here
Mast f.nl.'aiTd five ttiotisaud less-than
the second contest.
(inc. explanation is that many fans
made no attempt tu attend, upon the
supposition that there would be no
el. ancn uf getting inside the park, ow
ing to the huge crowds that were be
lieved to be storming the grounds.
Anolher is that the world's Serbs is
no longer a novelty in Huston, where
four have been held in the past five
yea i n.
Another juizzling feature was the
rather a iat net ic bearing of those who
were present. Due magnate advanced
tl.e opinion that it was not due to any
lack of interest in the game, but came
about as the result of the composition
of the crow d. He said :
"II was a 'five dollar crowd,' und
by that, 1 mean it was composed to a
great extent of persons who are uc
eustoini.d t,, attending the theater, op
'ra, and like amusements, and who
express their approval in a rather
iniiil manner from the baseball stand-
point. Aliinv. too. were imt tin
close
i play
followers of the game and 1h
in ils intricate places went over their .
lifinls."
Ttip Hrooklyn players agree with
'heir manager that' it was Harry j
Ihiuper. the Huston fit1 lit fielder, who .
hri'lie the budding offensive of the j
Hrwuklyns in the fourth inning, when j
'"' iiiiiile a marvelous catch of Cut- ,
luiws seemingly saie hit and then '
"fter falling to the ground, recovered j
himself and bv a fast line throw got
h' nt at the plate. j
"That was the turning point of the I
game." said .lack i'ooinbs, the former
Athletic pitcher, and now one of the I
l'''i"lilyn's dependable:.
"our offensive was snapped at a
point when it was apparent to all that
We were (jn the road to making sev
' 'al runs, t nice in the lead, all Mar
'I'lanl wonltl liave had to do was to

So tat' us Is uppnrcnt from Iln- arguments advanced In their lehnlf,

ran the ol'liee of superintendent of the New Mexico penitent iary.
'lo inn it a little differently: Will Ihihltell make the same sort of
senator that he made u county lav assessor? Will Kni'siim make the
same sort of governor that he made Mix i lnlcndent of the penitentiary '.
The people of New Mexico are entitled to this informal ion. They
