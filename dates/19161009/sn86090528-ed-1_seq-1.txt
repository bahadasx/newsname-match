KAISER ADOPTS
HURRY-UP TACTICS
Points Out that Preparations are Already
Under Way for Winter Campaign
Which May Be Headed Off
(By C. W. Ackermun, United Press
Staff Correspondent.)
Cologne. Oct. 7. It is not impossi
ble that Ambassador Gerard is convey
ing peace proposals to America from
German. Before leaving Berlin he
fyeld most important conferences with
Chancellor von Hollweg, Von Jugow,-
Dr. Soiff, secretary for tho colonies,
and several members of the reiehstag.
It Is believed here that now is the
time for Washington to make peace
overtures and that only Washington
can do this, by reason of the great in
.'lueuce of tho United States govern
ment with London and Paris. It is
thought that now is the phychological
moment for such a move fcr if peace is
not made now the war will last anoth
er year as plans for a winter cam
paign havo been prepared.
An armistice is not mentioned but
it i believed that President Wilson
can appeal to the powers to send spe
cial representative! to Washington to
negotiate and in the meantime the
war can go on till a basis for durable
peace is reached in the negotiations.
AUTO TURNS
OVER THRICE
NONE HURT
Another of those marvelous escapes
from death which make the annals of
nutomol::;::.' Uturesting occurred yes
ttuday afternoon to a trio of Chickasha
pleasure seekers while on their way to
Verden. While not trying to break
any record and going at a rate of
speed which would under any condi
tions be called! reasonable W. T. Mar
tin, driving his car and accompanied
by John Loclereq and Jess. Luster,
gave an imitation of threo daring
sportsmen going over Niagara Falls in
a barrel. A blowout of the rear tire
at a most unfortunate time and place
sent tho car jumping to the embank
ment about half way to Verden and
tho embankment sent tho machine
rolling over and over it until it reached
its third round, according to the other
contestants, after jumping about three
feet in the air. Tho only casualty was
a slight scratch which Mr. Martin no
ticed lonj after he bad returned to
town.

DELAYED SETTLEMENT '
All (urr"( claims against the coun
ty now have been passed and the war
rants forwarded to various claimants.
The delay in passing these claims this
month by the board of county commis

of the session.

Dear Sir:
I write to a.sk when Chickasha died,
or relapsed into innocuous desuetude
as it were.
At a good roads meeting t Lawton.
a week or two ago, to consider the
Oztirk Trail proposition, a man from
Cement told us that Lawton would
have to see to making the road from
hero to Chickasha as Chickasha will
do nothing, and the roads between
Chickasha and Cement are hardly pass
able. Some parties from Lawton went
to Chickasha to pilot Mr. Harvey over
the road to Lawton.
They rejxjrt that Col. Harvey was
shown scant courtesy at Chic -kuMta
and hardly a dozen people there gave
him a hearing; that the roads are so
bad on the Cement route that h" can
not consider them and that there ts
so little enterprise shown by the peo
ple of Chickasha. and so little encour
agement for the promoters of the great
national highway that he will not ap

WILSON S
COLOSSAL
INTELLECT
Has Borne America to Heights Unaliaifltain
ahle Savi by Gigantic Intelligence of
Great American LeaJer
ALLEN K. SWAN HOLDS
RUSH SPRINGS AUDIENCE
Defends Policies of Democratic Adminis
tration at Mass Meeting and Discusses
Leading Vital Issues
Allen K. Swan, assistant county at
torney, spoke at Verden, last Saturday
afternoon at three o'clock in the place
of Judge F. M. Bailey who was unable
to fill the appointment made for him
at that time.
Mr. Swan reports' that there was a
fair crowd present at the time, and
that the hearers were attentive during
tho cutlro speech. Mr. Swan took the
position that the record of the present
Democratic administration was one of
astounding achievement and construc
tive progress; holding thnt.it has no
parallel in history. ,
"When wo think," said Mr. Swan,
"of tho things which that great man
Woodrow Wilson has done we can' but
lie astounded at this colossal intellect,
his possession of wliu'h has meant
ni'-re tl) tho safety of American, life
ami the upbuilding: of American honor
and integrity than any other thine in
recent history. Tho American people
have faced many. crise. Every gener
ation Is confronted with numerous peril,1-:,
tin correct solution of which in
volves the safety and honor and in
tegrity of the United States. We are
facing a crisis today, and have recent
ly faced many perilous moments,
through which we have been safely
guided by the fearless wisdom of our
president."
M.r. Swan went further into Wilson's
policy of neutrality, showing by com
parison with history that Wilson's pol
icies regarding our relation with oth
er nations are policies sanctioned by
history, taking the position that Wil
son's policies have more carefully pro
tected America, and America's neutral
ity and citizenship than they have ere?
been protected in the history of the
country,- commending very highly the,,
efforts of our president to I jep us
out of war., . f " : ;
Boosts Preparedness.'
Mr. Swan then discussed the ques
tion of preparedness, showing that
when the Republican party turned the
. i -.-
t in, itcuii ciciBii Huun, me t. i.iieu auuex
was in a deplorable state of unprepar
edness, and that the present adminis
tration has more than tripled the
standing army, and has appropriated
$6jj,ni"'0,000 for preparedness as
against slightly over $.10O,00O,0OO ap
propriated by the Republican admin
istration for the last twelve years.
Defends Mexican Policies.
Mr. Swan spiritedly defended tli
policies of Mr, Wilson towards Mexi
80. showing that Mr. Wilson in form
ing his Mexican policies had to be
guided by the history of the past and
by tho hope of the future; that the
republic of South America looked with
suspicion upon our Me Van policy
fearing that the Uniietl States desired
to annex Mexico and then when the
South American, republics were in un
fortunate circumstances pursue against
them a war of conquest; that Wilson
was compelled to show by his policy
toward Mexico our real unselfishness,
and prove our real friendship and ce
ment our friendship with tho Latin
states of America; that those who
wero guilty of depredations against
American life ami property were not
representatives of Mexican govern
ment hut bandits then at war wiiii the
government of Mexico.
