British steamers have been sunk.
, One was the Dutch stesmer Bloom

steamer Christian Knadson.
The crews of both vessels were
picked' op by the American torpedo
boat destroyer Drayton and are being

Rumor Says Fleet of Subs Off Coast
During Sunday no word came from
the British and French patrol vessels
which have been watching the At
lantic coast from which veasela of
the entente allies with munitions of
war have dally set out
Msny rumors were afloat 8undar.
Including one that a fleet of German
submarines were off the coaat
Another had It that the German

stated thst the 8tephano had been Thr h.M i ..- i
sunk at 6 o'clock Sunday morning and 0,,n0n p,nled out that the aubma-
u0 row 0i iwcmy men were on me rme, after ostensibly cruising the At-
-8
ugntsbip. The steamer carried a
crew of thirty-four, so there waa some
doubt as to whether the lightship hsd
picked them all up or had correctly
reported.
The Stcjihano sailed from New
York for Bordeaux Saturday. She was
of tons and STS feet In length.
She was built In Greenwich In 1909
and waa owned In Glasgow.
The submarine next came up with
the West Point, bound from Ixndon
for Newport News. The fate of the
British freighter was told In the fol
lowing wireless from her commsnder.
Captain Harden, to the naval radio
station:
8teamer West Point Stopped and
Shelled.
"British steamer West Tolnt stnp-j
ped by submarine and fired upon Get
ting boata ready. Poult Ion 40.25 north.
M west Get cutter." .
Later messages gave further de
tails. One stated that the steamer
was being shelled by the submarine
when the message was sent at 11 :1S
a. m. A third message aald the vessel
wss attacked at 10:40 10 miles south
of Nantucket. The steamer Kansas
picked up the distress signals of the
West Tolnt and proceeded to her as
sistance. Tha Boston navy yard at
1:30 received a mestags from -the
Kansas stating that the West Point
wss sinking snd that the Kansas was
tolng to her aid. The disabled vseael
waa then (5 miles distant and the
Ksnsaa waa making IS knota.
Later a private dlspatra said the
submarine, after stopping the West
Point, ordered the crew Into the small
boata. The crew abandoned the ship,
which was then torpedoed.
Meantime lbs American Una steam

Tork SaUrday for Liverpool, bad tot

was distinctly hesrd at Nantucket
But where the submersible waa at tha
moment these reports were hesrd waa
speculation. It wss plain, however,
that she had placed herself In the lane
of passenger and freight traffic and
terrorised shipping along the coast
After tho first distress slgnala of the
West Point were sent broadcast wire
lew messsgea were aent op and down '
the coast and far out to aea warning
everything afloat that a German sub
marine was operating In tha steamer
lane. '
Every vessel equipped with wire
less waa warned to make for the
three-mile sone and the commanders
of merchant vessels of the entente
allies lost no time In shifting their
couraea. ,
