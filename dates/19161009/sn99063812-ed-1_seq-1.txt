Two hundred and twenty gallons of
liquor, believed to bo wine or whls-j
key, was seized last night by Shorlff
C. C. Low, aided by Deputy Sheriff
Moyd Low and Chief of Police R. T.
Daldwln. The Bclzurc was made a
short distance south of Algoma while
the booro was on a four horse wagon
driven by Silas Kidder.
Kidder, who says he was employed
by Greeks or Italians at Algoma to
haul tho whiskey, left Dorrls with his
load, four barrels of the liquor, yes
terday morning. From Keno to Al
goma ho was watched by Sheriff Low,
who had hoard of Kidder's expedi
tion. He camo through Klamath
Falls, going down Klamath avenue,
and then went to Algoma. Sheriff
Low was behind him, but close
enough to keep him In sight most of
the time.
Once when the sheriff's car was
stopped along the road, two Italians
or Greeks came south on motorcycles.
Soon aftorward they wero seen com
ing back on the same road to Algoma.
It is believed that they discovered
Sheriff Low, who pretended to have a
blowout, and Immediately rushed to
Algoma, warned the men to whom the
liquor was being hauled, and had Kid
der Instructed not to deliver the load.
When within a hundred or mora
yards of Algoma, Kidder turned
around and started back toward
Klamath Falls. All the time be waa
telng watched by Deputy Sheriff
Lloyd Low and Chief Baldwin, al
though they and Sheriff Low arrived
n little too late to see the meeting of
Kidder and the persona for whom he
waa hauling the liquor.
After Kidder had driven a short
distance south, he was arrested by
Sheriff Low and taken to Klamath
Falls. This afternoon he la being
questioned by District Attorney John
Irwin in an effort to learn by whom he
waa hired to Import the liquor Into
Oregon. It is not believed he Is any
more than a hireling.
Kidder waa In the custody of, the
