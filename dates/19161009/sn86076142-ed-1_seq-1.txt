. WASHINGTON, Oct. 9. Posslblll
ties of diplomatic complications over
the German submarine raid seemed
to point toward the allies as well as
Germany. State and navy ""officials
are scanning the unofficial reports of
destruction of ships within sight of
American shores. They found no rea
son to change their first impression
that the submarine operations were
conducted within the limitations of
international law. They felt fully
alive to the dangerous possibilities
that destruction of an American ship
carrying contraband might cause.
Complication with the allies lies in
the contention that the submarines
should be excluded from all neutral
ports. The position of the United
States has been to decide on the
merits of the case of each submarine
entering an American port.
