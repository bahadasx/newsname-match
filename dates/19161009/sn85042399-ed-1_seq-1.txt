Over Two Thousand
Vehicles Pass
The September travel over the Pa
cific Highway through Ashland, both
north or south over the Siskiyous, to
talled 2,313 vehicles, according to
statistics furnished by the state en
gineer. How the figures are keptls
a mystery to most, although that they
are correct is not doubted. A few
cars must slip through at night, how
ever, that are undetected by the un
known statistician. The September
travel probably represents the high
tide of travel for the year.

September Was
A Thirsty Month
The booze shipments into Ashland
are still on the increase, according
to the September report of the chief
of police. While during August 15
gallons of whiskey were shipped In,
September saw the amount increased
to 18 gallons. Beer shipments in
creased from SO gallons to 87 gal
lons. Wine slumped from two gal
lons .to two quarts. The total ship
ments during September were 165
gallons.
May Encamp Here
! Again Next Year
I That the G. A. R. encampment
which was held at Ashland this year
I was so successful that the encamp
j ment next year may also come Jiere,
i Is thought eminently probable. Ev
erything was ideal for the reunion
session here. The Chautauqua park
; provided an encampment spot ideally
located, handy to town and to the
! Chautauqua tabernacle, where the
I meetings were held. In other cities
j in the valley the lack of a suitable
camping place near a building where
meetings could be held has proved a
j handicap as it was necessary to pro
vide means of transportation to and
! fro for the old soldiers. There seems
to be no reason why Ashland should
not again get the encampment. The
matter Is left in the hands of the of
ficers, no selection having been made
at the recent gathering of the next
year's location. '

Rush Grading of
Sutherlin Road
Orders were given last Monday to
rush work on the gradeB of the
Roach logging, road at Sutherlin
which is under construction from
there to the timber company's big
holding east of Sutherlin, says a dis
patch from that place. Owing to the
limited supply of local teams the
compauy has contracted for teams
from Junction City and points In the

Another carload of grading ma
chinery was shipped from Portland
Monday, and fifty teams are to be
employed as soon as they can be
gathered up.

together with Saturday and Sunday
will give the students five days with
no school, and many hunting trips
are planned as a result.

Biggest Cattle
Sale This Fall
The largest sale of cattle from this
end of the valley of the fall occurred
recently when Miller & Lux of San
Francisco purchased 720 head of cat
tle from the cattle raisers of this vi
cinity. Messrs. J. J. Murphy, George
Nichols, Kincald, McAllister and a
number of others were represented.
The beef was in fine condition and
brought a handsome sum In good
hard cash which will jingle around
in the Ashland marts of trade to
quite a noticeable extent.

well defined Idea of who the thieves
were, however.
The car must have been going at
a high rate of speed when It went off
the paved highway, for It went
through a well-built wire' fence,
across a deep ditch and finally hit
sideways on a tree. It Is hardly
thought possible that the occupants
could have been hurt, as some people

The car was badly damaged. Both

The wind shield was broken and the
font end bent and battered out of
shape.

reporter journeyed up to the Citizens
Bank and there found V. u. Smith
bubbling over with enthusiasm for
the club work and anxious to let
others know how he feels. Here are
a few oi his statements regarding
the Ashland Commercial Club:
"To me the outlook for the Com

appearance and easy access creates
a better atmosphere and feeling ill

and I am sure our present plan of

ists for.

club Is entering upon a new era of
usefulness. I find that a good many

"With our board of fourteen trus

minimum, and without the burden ot
debt that wo have been struggling
with, I am sincere in saying that I
believe we have an organization that
is worthy of the support of every
man Interested in the future of Ash
land. "In granting the club the nse of
a room in the city hall, the members
of the council showed their apprecia

terests of the club in a way that ia
worthy of much commendation. ' It
was decidedly a progressive step, and
speaks well for future co operation
between the council and Commercial
Club, in solving community prob
lems." Engineer Arthur Miller, whose run
is on the Klamath Falls branch of
the Southern Pacific, was a visitor
at his home' here over Sunday.
