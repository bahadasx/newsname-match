For foul teen inni nits the Boston
Americans and the Brooklyn Nation
als hi-tiled in the second game of the
world series tfulay.
F'lia' score. Boston 2, Brooklyn 1.
Flashing the class that made them
champions of their respective leagues,
both the Dodgers and the Crimson
Stockings played bang-up ball from
the start and the game was much
more of an exhibition of skill than
the opener Saturday. "tioth Sherrod J
Smith, of the Fatbush brigade, and I
...o ... . . - . . i
George t Babe ) Ruth, of the Carrl-
gun clan, were at their best at the ,
tirst t ail to the mound and as the j
ame progressed it became largely a
twiners nuei.
Brooklyn took the jump in the
tial inn.iis when Myers connected with I
a fast ball and sent it riding to the
outer s.ands for a home run.
lloston tied the count in the last of
the third, when Scott scored on Ruth's
fcruunder.
I p to the sixth inning Smith had
allowed but three hits and Ruth had
lieiu the Brooklyns to four.
In the first half of the eighth inn-
ini; Rrookiyn staged an attack that i
onlv the siioeri. ,ipfi.nA .,f wnn.ier-I
lul team could check. The Dodgers i
t;ot men on second and third with only
one out, but the Beaneaters tightened
up and retired them scoreless. With
Aiowrey on second base. Miller sin
gled to center andfcit appeared as tho
a Brooklyn run would sure be hung
up, but Walker made a perfect peg to
the plate and held Mowrey in his
tracks.
The official attendance was 41,373,
it was announced. Mowey almost
spilled the beans in the last half of
the ninth when, after Janvrin had
doubled he dropped Smith's throw to
second, a sacrifice and Janvrin went
to third. Rut Janvrin was thrown out
at the plate, forcing the game to ex
trn. innings. During the full nine in-nini-s
Ruth had allowed six hits and
Smith four.
In the tenth inning Scott, for Bos
ton, singled, was sacrificed to second,
leached third and tried to score on a
grounder but was caught trying to
gel buck to the bag.
The Brooklyns were retired in or
der in the first half of the eleventh,
itoth Smith and Ruth held up wonder
fully well under the strain and at the
close of the eleventh inning seemed to
be as effective as at the start.
Only three men faced Ruth in the
first half of the twelfth frame. Old
time fans in the stands said it was
one of the greatest exhibitions ever
staged in a world series. In the first
half of the thirteenth inning Duffy
Lewis cut off a possible Brooklyn run
when he made a seemingly impossible
catch of Smith's fly.
Gaynor drove in the winning run for
Boston with a single in the last of the
fourteenth inning, scoring McNally,
running for Hoblitzel.

BY I W. GETTY.
Newport, R. I., Oct. 9. Dripping
with brine, which stood out like sweat
on their steel sides from prodigious
efforts of rescuing passengers of six
torpedoed merchant ships, four United
States destroyers arrived here before
dawn today, bringing the first stories
of the European war carried to Amer
ica's doorstep.
While powerful searchlights flashed
and whistles seunded, the destroyer
Kriccson the fore to arrive nosed

ations of Germany's U-boat's striking
terror to shipping off the New Ung-
land coast,. - - "
Of the persons picked up from
small boats by tho Ericcson not 'one
was injured. Practically alii how
ever, had lost every personal belong
ing. They were without money or
baggage of any description. They had
only the clothes they wore.
For the first time in their lives, of
ficers and men of the Ericcson saw
babies cooing on the grim warship.
Fourteen babies and their mothers
were in the boats the Ericcson found
hobbling on the water which had be
come the grave of the steamer
Stephano. bound from St. Johns to
New York. The infants were sleeping
peacefully in the arms of their moth
ers or nurses as the lifeboats rolled
and rocked with the gentle swell of the
sea. Almost all night long the boats
had drifted. Only the dim light of a
lantern in the life saving craft and
the soft rays of the moon, sifting in
termittently thru the clouds served to
light the scene, which but a few hours
before had been one of American
peace.
i Only a short distance away was a
sea-green monster. The submarine
j rested low in the water, her bulging
; sjoes and pointed snout giving her the
appearance of a giant man-killing
fish. Four thousand miles from a
home port, theoretically in enemy
waters and with no known base for
supplies or fuel, the Teuton was un
loosening her wrath at the very doors
of America. When the first alarm was
given a shot came screaming across
the bows.

Scores of Ships Coming and

New York, Oct 9. Owners, agents
and others interested in vessels near
the Atlantic eoast flying the flags of
nations hostile to Germany passed an
uneasy night and today sought every
possible avenue of news regarding
their ships. Many of the vessels
within the German U-boat danger zone
carry scores of American and Euro
pean passengers. including some
notable in financial, business, thea
trical and social circles. It seemed
Kdot'btful today that the submarine
f raid would result in a general tieup
"of the shipping of the entente nations
in American ports, but one of the
most important steamship companies
controlUng both British and American
vessels, the International Mercantile
Marine company, issued orders that no
British ships of that line, should leave
Atlantic ports pendir.g lurther orders.
This order stopped the sailing of all
steamers of the Whiite Star, Atalantic
transport, Leyland. Dominion and Red
Star lines and the vessels of the White
Star-Dominion lines sailing for Mon
treal and Quebec. The order will not
interfere with the sailing of .he Amer
ican line steamships of any companies
under the American flag.
Will Sail Despite Danger.
Officers of the Cunard. French and
of the Italian lines declared that their
passenger and freight vessels would
sail as -usual, despite the submarine
menace. At the Cunard line offices it
was announced no changes would be
made in the sailing of steamers until
instructions were received from the
main office at Liverpool. All Cunard
vessels, it was pointed cut. are armed
with 4.7-inch guns, and the German
submarines thus far have avoided ves
sels so armed. The French liners
carry 3 H -inch guns and English boats
carry 3 ti -inch rapid fire cannons.

The other four destroyers carried
submarine victim passengers as fol

The fact that the weather was mild

30 Americans on Board.
Of the passengers of the Stephano,
thirty were American tourists return

maritime provinc s. All came
thru their rcujit experiences without
injury, according to officers of ,tne
American destroyers but lost nearly
all their effects. Lieutenant Com

picked up some of the boat from the
stenhano. said that no attack was

None of the shots struck the ship and

Before Commander Miller could get

SUBMARINE BASE ON GULF?
Try to Cut Off British Oil Sup

Washington, Oct. 9. The navy de
partment began today preparations to
establish a patrol of warships atong
the north Atlantic coast to make cer
tain that American neutrality is not
violated by the German submarine
raid on allied shipping.
Asbury Park, N. J., Oct. 9. The
German submarines active in the
steamship lane off Nantucket com
plied with all Tules of international
law before acting, Secretary Daniels
informed President Wilson in a pre
liminary report today. Daniels is ex
pected to make a formal report late
in the day. 1 The president will make
no statement until complete evidence
regarding the submarines is in his
hands.
Daniels reported early advices re
ceived showed no loss of life as the
result of the submarine attacks and
that the submarines gave full notice,
of their intentions before sinking any
of the vessels. No definite word has
yet been received from the crew of
Thev -Kingston, which was mink thirty
miles off Nantucket, naval reports
said. Several United States destroyers
are in that vicinity.
Diplomatic Complications Pending.
Washington, Oct. 9. Possibilities of
diplomatic complications over the Ger
man submarine raid along the New
England coast seemed today to point
toward the allies as well as Germany.
State and naval officials scanning tlie
unofficial reports of the destruction
of ships within sight of American
shores, found no reason today to
change their first impression that the
eubrriarine operations had been con
ducted so far within the limitations
of International law, but they were
fully alive to the dangerous possibili
ties. Destruction of an American ship
carrying contraband might easily
cause another Frye case and any loss
of life at all in any case might easily
reopen the whole submarine question.
The threatened complication with
the allies lies in their contention that
submarines because of their nature
should be excluded from all neutral
ports. Today's London dispatches
quoting from the Manchaster Guardi
an to the effect that such a view has
been "set forth in the recent memo
randum sent by the allies to neutral
governments" contained the first Inti
mation received here ttiat anything in
the nature of a tormal representa
tion had been made. The position of
the United States r-o far as it has been
announced has een to decide on its
merits the case of each submarine en- .
tering an American port. Inasmuch
as the German submarine which en
tered Newport Saturday took no sup
plies, asked for .10 privileges and de
parted almost Immediately, it is net
thought that she raised any issue. .
Strike on Iiiel Oil Supply.
The general opinion prevailing to
day was that with the gathering of
allied cruisers off the New England
coast the submarines would desert
that field and Btrike their next blow
further south. Some officials ex
pected to hear of operations Jn the
Gulf of Mexico where a persistent
.story says a German bt.se has been
established and where the sub
mersibles could strike at the fleets of
tank shins carrying fuel oil to the
British navy from the Mexican fields,
upon which the British depend almost
entirely. The opinion that there are
several submarines accompanied by a
supply ship, probably also a sub
mersible, has been strengthened by
the developments.
The American government's attitude
toward the German side of the new.
situation will, of course, be decided by
President Wilson himself.
Names uf 220 Survivors.
Newport, R. I.. Oct! 9. Rear Ad
miral Albert Gleaves, commander of

In Government Service?
New York, Oct. 9. The Kingston
fan's movements have not been re
corded l-itely in the maritime records,
a fact which usually indicates for a
British vessel that had been taken over
in the government service. The King
stonian was a vessel of 4,207 tons.
Previous reports had it that the Brit
ish steamer Kingston had been tor-pedoed.
