CLOSELY
German Ambassador to Talk With
the President This Afternoon
at Probably Import
.ant Conference.
HV
[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
AS BURY PARK, N. J., Oct 9.—
President Wilson was still without of
ficial word early today of the Ger
man raids off New 'England, hence
withheld any Indication of his atti
tude.
He was slated to talk with German
Ambassador VonBernstorff at 2 p.
m. for the first time in many months.
The conference was ararnged some
time ago for the purpose of discuss
ing Polish relief.
Until late into the night, tele
graphers worked with Washington to
learn whether German boats bad
violated the protection given by the
imperial government given In the
past. But no determining Indication
came.
The deepest anxiety over the sit
uation was manifest but official
action and official comment were
withheld in keeping with the past
rules, not to act without full facts.
Messages from the state and navy
departments early today said these
branches were hard at work garner
ing information and would rush It
through the moment it was obtained.
Bernstorffs visit is assumed to be
as stated reliably for the purpose of
delivering Kaiser Wllhelm's answer
to the president's personal appeal
for co-operation by European rulers to
help starving Poland.
Nevertheless some saw in the visit
an extra significance in view of the
rumored peace moves by Germany as
well as the fact that German raiders
so spectacularly sunk ships off the
American coast.
Officials here attach little import
ance to the letters delivered by the
U-53, pointing out a special German
messenger would have forwarded
these had they teen vital instead of
having them intrusted to an ordinary
American citizen.
'As for a new peace move, officials,
moluding the president, profe9S to
have no Information. There is every
Indication that the governemmt sees
no early end of the war and plans no
part in bringing such an end immed
iately.
Complied With Law.
ASBURY PARK, N. J., Oct. 9.—The
German submarine active In the
steamship lane oft Nantucket com-,
plied with all rules of international
law before acting, Secretary Daniels
informed President Wilson in a pre
liminary report today.
Daniels is expected to make formal
report later in the day. The presi
dent will make no statement unti!
complete evidence regarding the sub
marines is in his hands.
Daniels reported early advices re
ceived show no loss of life as result I
of submarine attacks and that the
Submarines gave full notice of their
intentions before sinking any of the
vessels. No definite word as yet has
been received from the crew of the
Kingston which sunk thirty miles off
Nantucket, naval reports said. Sev
eral U. S. destroyers are in that
vicinity.
Unable to Locate.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.—The navy
department was advised by Admiral
Knight by telegraph today that United
States destroyers have been unable to
locate the crew of the British freighter

German torpedoes Send Mifiant Ships to Bottom of
Sea at Doors of America
fBy Fred S. Ferguson, llnlteo-vress Staff Correspondent.]
BOSTON, Mass., Oct. 9.—The trans-Atlantic lane over which has flowed a steady stream,
of munitions and supplies fon the allied powers from American shores is in the grip of submar.
rines of the kaiser's navy todjay. v"?
Six unara%d merchantman axe Smown to lie on the ocean bottom south of Nantucket,
torpedoed by German submerspbles and late reports have it that two and possibly three
more have-been sunk.
The vessels positively known to have been destroyed are:
The Stephano, 2,153 tons, British Red Cross line, St. Jqhns, N. F., to New York.
The Strathgene, 4,321 tons, British New York to Bordeaux. \v,\
The West Point (no tonnage given) British, London to Newport News.
The Kingston (no tonnage given) British, destination not iknown.
The Bloomersdijk, 3,201 tons, Dutch, New York to Rotterdam.
Christian Knudson, 2,538 tons, Norwegian, destination unknown.
The passengers and crews of all the vessels are known to have -been rescued with the exception of those
of the Kingston. The fate of the men on this ship is as yet unknown.
Allied warships are now closing In upon Germany's new submarine zone. The crackling wireless of three
British cruisers Is mingling wl$i that of American destroyers out upon the sea on missions of mercy and rescue.
Reports to Nantucket, Newport and Boston indicate there la certainly more than one sufamar.ne striking
terror along the great International water highway. Officers of the steamer Kansan Indicate beilef that two en
emy super-U boats were operating at America's very portals.
A dispatch from the United Press staff correspondent at Newport declares Miss Margaret Wilson statsd
positively that she saw the name U-61 painted on a life preserver of the submarine which ssnk the steamer
ftsphano.. Miss Wilson who was a pa*a«nger on the Stephano, said she looked at the submarine, through
galssss and declared she could not-be mistaken on the fetter affif figures she saw. As the fighting submarine
which put In st Newport was the U-53, this would definitely account for two submerslbles.
At Nantucket a report has befen picked up that two or three submarines are In action and that the number
of ships sunk is now eight or nine.
The crew of the steamer Kingston one of the six known victims, was still missing today. There Is every
hope that the men from this ship may still be adrift or .picked up by aome destroyer which has not yet reported.
Good weather prevails off the New England coaat and if the Kingston's crew got off before their ship went down,
naval officers bellevq there Is every reason to take an optimistic view of the situation. A total of 216 survivors
have now been landed at Newport from four American destroyers. The Ericcson landed eighty-one, the Drayton
six, the Benham, thirty-six and the Jenkins thirty-one.
Included among the passengers were many women and fourteen babies. The survivors brought stories
scarcely equalled In the lore of the sea since the sinking of the Titanic or the Lusltanla. There is no doubt In
shipping circles here that Germany's plana for Intercepting munitlon^carry Ing ships were carefully laid. Elud
ing the allied patrol, the submersibles have established themselves squarely In the path of practically all trans
Atlantic ships. The regular lane recognized by all navigators Is off Nantucket Light. It Is there that the mon
sters of the kaiser's submarine force are lurking. They are In a position to strike any type of ahlp they desire.
For Instance, the big American line steamer Philadelphia, with passengers and freight from New York to Liver
pool, was In the waters from which the reports of German submarines have come today. The Soandlnavlan
Amerlcan liner, Frederick VIII, is somewhere off that part of the ooast, bound from Copenhagen to New York,
with Ambassador Gerard aboard.
One of the mysteries of the new undersea campaign is the escape of the steamer Kansan, chartered by the
French government and carrying an enormous cargo of munitions.
