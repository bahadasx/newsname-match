to a late hour no officii word had
been receive, I indicating that inter
national complications would follow.
Tim government officials were
plainly worried over the situation and
made efforts to get all information
obtainable, as quickly as possible. It
was stated that the piesoleiit would
pay no attention to preliminary
meagre reports and would keep his
mind open until definite. Information
is supplied through official sources.
.More Watchful Wailing.
Tho (uesli,,n of administration of

Americans hoi I n losi and wheth r
the vessels were warned In accordance
Willi international law. It was stated
that, a very thorough Investigation

notion would he taken.
With receipt of word of the sinking

tached to Ihe visit here tomorrow el'

Whllo arrangements for his visit were
made through the stale department,

I toonuso of tho conflicting attitudes
of tho entente ullies and centril
powers, officials have almost aban
doned hope of bringing about an
agreement for extending relief to the
starving Poles.
Tho president has an engagement
