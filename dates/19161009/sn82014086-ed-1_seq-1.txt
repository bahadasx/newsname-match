Presence of the Hostile Submarine An. American
Steamer Was Held Up But Was Allowed to Proceed.
Boston, Oct. 8. The submarine arm
of the Imperial German Navy ravaged
shipping: oft the eastern coast of the
United States today.
Four British, one Dutch and one
.Norwegian steamers were sent to the
bottom or left crippled derelicts off
'Nantucket Shoals.
Tonight under the light of the hunt
ers' moon, the destroyer flotilla of the
.United States Atlantic fieet was pick
ing up passengers and crews of the
destroyed vessels and bringing them
into Newport, R. L So far as known,
there was no loss of life, thourjh at a
late hour the crew of the British
'steamer Kingston had not been ac
counted for.
American Steamer Held Up.
A submarine held up the American
steamer Kansan, tapund from New
York for G noa with s'.oel for the
Italian government, but later on es
tablishing her identity, allowed the
American to proceed. The Kansan
came into Boston harbor late tonight
for her usual call here.
The hostile submarine is believed to
be the U-53 which paid a call to
"Newport yesterday and disappeared at
sunset. Seme naval men, however,
declared that at least two submarines
are operating close to the American
shore though outside the three mile
limit.
The Ships Destroyed.
The record of submarine warring,
as brought to land by wireless des
patches, follows:
British Freighter Strathdeoa Torpe
doed. The Strathdene, British freighter,
torpedoes and sunk off Nantucket
Crew taken aboard Nantucket Shoals
lightship, and later removed to New
port by torpedo boat destroyers. The
vessel left New York yesterday for
Bordeaux and was attacked at 3 a. m.
West Point Sunk Off Nantucket.
The West Point, British freighter,
torpedoed and sunk off Nantucket.
Crew abandoriPiT the ship in small
boats after a ;:r.i'-i?'chot from the
submarine's gun. C:7k-ers and men
were taken aboard a destroyer. The
vessel was attacked at 70:! 5 a. m.
She was bound from London for New
port News.
Passenger Liner Sunk.
Ste;)hano, British pasaensrer, liner,
plying regularly between New York,
Halifax and St. Johns, Newfoundland.
Torpedoed southeast of Nantucket
while bound for New York. Reported
still afloat late tonight. Passengers
and crew numbering about 110, were
picked up by destroyer Falch and
.. transferred to the destroyer Jenkins
and brought to Newport. The at
tack was at 4:30 p. m.
Destroyer Searching for Crew.
Kingston, British freigntr, torpe
doed and sunk southeast ot Nantucket.
Crew missing and destroyer searching
for them. This vessel is no account
ed for in maritime registers and may
be tho Kingstonian. The attack was
at 6 p. m.
Bloomersdijk, Dutch freighter, tor
pedoed and sunk south of Nantucket
Crew taken aboard a destroyer. The
steamer was bound from New York
for Rotterdam, having sailed last
night.
Norwegian Freighter.
Chr Knudsen, Norwegian freighter,
torpedoed and sunk near where the
(Bloomersdijk went down, rew pick
ed up by destroyers. The vessel sail
ed from New York Saturday for Lon
don. The sensation created yesterday
when the U-53 -quietly aliped into
Newport harbor and as quietly slipped
away three hours later wss less than
the shock in shipping clrc'es when
wireless reports of submarine attacks
began to come Into the naval radio
stations Just before noon today.
Within a few minutes the air was
literally charged with ele-?ficlty as
wireless messages of warning shot up
and down the coast.
The submarine or submarines had
taken a position directly in the steam
er lanes' where they could hordly miss
anything bound in for New York or
bound east from that port.
Vessels Hurry Within Three Mile
Limit.
Vessels of the allied nations and
neutral bottome carrying contraband
of war scurried to get within the three
mile limit of the American shore.
Several who were following the out
r.ide course shifted and made for the
lnsfide lane. The Stephano of the
Tied -.'Cross Line, however, was caught
outside the neutral zone. The des
truction of this vessel was perhaps
the biggest prize of the day. The
craft had been sold to the Russian
'government and would have teen used
as an Ice breaker after her present
irip.
Frantic .Appeal Sent to Halifax.
Kirougrhout the day and -up to late
Ravaged by a Submarine
Imperial Navy
tonight none of the patrolling fleet
maintained by the British and French
to protect their oxn shiroing and
American ships carrying muntions of
war had been sighted. Frantic ap
peals were sent to Halifax, but the
commander of the British naval sta
tion there refused to divulge what
steps were being taken to meet the
submarine attack.
The work of the patrolling fleets
was, directed from Halifax and ever
since the war began cruisers and aux
illiary vessels of the Eritisn and
French navies have moved up and
down the coast line.
Bringing Passengers to Newport.
The passengers and crews of des
troyed vessels who are being brought
into Newport were not expected to
reach there until after midnight. Pre
parations to care for them had been
made by Rear Admiral Austin M.
Knight, commandant of the Narra
gansett Bay nav.ii station, rear
Admiral Elbert Gleaves, commander
of the destroyer flotilla now at New
port. Details of the Attacks.
Later reports gave further details
of the attacks. The Stephano met a
submarine six miles southeast of
Nantucket lightship and was attacked
by gunfire and a torpedo. She re
mained afloat until 10: OS o'clock to
night. The West Point went down ten
miles south of the Nantucket light-
ship. The Strathdene was attacked
"off lightship", the report stated and
the Bloomersdijk was sunk three miies
south of the lightship. She remained
afloat some time, going down at S:05
The American steamer Kansan-was
held up three miles east of Nantucket
lightship.
First Wireless Warning.
The first wireless warning of the
presence of a hostile submarine In the
steamship line was giver; in the dis
tress signal of the West Point, which
reported that she had been torpedoed
thirty miles southeast of Nantucket
light. This message apparently was
picked up by every vessel having a
wireless equipment within range for
within a very short ;ime pi-ess des
patches from St. Johns, N. B., and
Halifax, N. S.. indicated that patrol
ling battleships had received the
alarm. The censorship, however, pre
vented the disclosure of the move
ments of the patrolling fleets.
Ship Owners Notify Vessels at Sea.
Meantime ship owners in Boston
were communicating with their ves
sels at sea. It is supposed that any
information regarding the submarine
activities that reached the battleships
came from other vessels rather than
from shore though it might have come
from Halifax, where the news was
received over land lines.
At 11:25 o'clock tonight the return
ing destroyer nearest home was still
fifty miles from Newport and she was
not expected until early morning. A
late message said that one destroyer
with two crews taken from the Nan
tucket lightship was bound for New
York, but it was thought that this
was probably a mistake.
Naval Men Puzzled.
One thing that 13 puzzling naval men
tonight is why the U-5.1 came into
port yesterday and another thing that
is the subject of speculation of many
outside the navy why a destroyer flo
tilla of seventeen vessels was sent out
to rescue the crew of a single freight
steamer. The destroyers were ordered
out at the first report that the West
Point had been torpedoed. The the
ory advanced tonight wus that Com
mander Hans Rose of the U-53 came
to Newoprt to advise Rear Admiral
Knight that he was about to attack
hostile shipping and contraband
carrying vessels under th rules of in
ternational law. Rear Admiral Knight
reiterated this evening that Comman
der Rose's call was one of courtesy
but it was suggested that the Ger
man commander wished to guard
against loss of life through the aid of
American vessels in picking up pas
sengers and crews of ships destroyed.
BOOMING OF GUNS
HEARD AT NANTUCKET
Submarine ts In Lane of Passenger
and Freight Traffic.
Boston, Oct. 8. The booming of the
submarine's guns apparently fired in
warning was distinctly heard at Nan
tucket. Just where the submersible
was at the moment these reports
were heard was pure speculation. It
was plain, however, that she had
placed herself in the lane of passen
ger and freight traffic and terrorized
shipping along the coast.
Wireless Messages of Warning.
In a flash after the first distress siur-
nals of the West Point were sent
broadcast, wireless messages were
racing up and down the coast and far
out to sea, warning everything afloat
that a German warship was operat
ing in the steamer lanes. Every ves
sel equipped with wireless was warned
to make for the three mile zone and
the commanders of merchant vessels
of the allies lost no time in shifting
their courses. Those that were fol
lowing what is known as the outside
course turned to the inside course
that would bring them closer to Amer
ican soil. The passenger steamer Ste
phano. which plies reguiarly between
New York and St. Johns. Newfound
land, was bound west and was due off
Nantucket tomorrow morning. When
her British commander received his
warning he shifted his course to bring
his vessel within the inside lane.
British consular officers along the
New England coast who had been ad
vised by the British embassy to warn
British shipping against the U-53 up
on her appearance at Newport yes
terday, renewed their caution on
learning that the submarine had gone
into action.
PANIC AMONG SHIPPERS
ALL ALONG THE
COAST
Anxious Inquiries Made at the News'
paper Offices.
Boston, Oct. 8. Something like I
panic possessed the minds of shippers
in this city and at other points along
the coast when the first reports of the
torpedoing were received from the
radio station. The stories regarding
the U-o-j which appeared in the Sun
day papers had aroused much specu
Iation as to her mission and the news
that she had attacked British vessels
traveled fast. Anxious inquiries were
made at the newsipaper offices from
seemingly almost everyone who had a
friend on the water or owned a share
of stock in a merchant bottom.
Gerards on a Neutral Vessel.
The Frederick VIII. of the Scandi
navian-American line, which is bring
ing home the American ambassador to
Germany, James W . Gerard, and Mrs
Gerard, was 600 miles east of New
York at noon today. Assurance that
the ambassador and his wife were on
a neutral vessel was given to inquir
Ing friends by the press.
Strathdene Sunk.
A half hour later the submarine en
countered the Strathdene, commanded
by Captain Wilson and under charter
by the French line. A subsequent
message from the Nantucket lightship
stated that the Strathdene had been
sunk at 6 o'clock this morning and
that the crew of '"twenty" men were
on the lightship. The steamer carried
a crew of 34, so there was some doubt
as to whether the lightship had pick
ed them all up or had correctly re
ported. The Strathdene sailed from
Xew York for Bordeaux yesterday af
ternoon. She was of 4,321 tons and
375 feet in length. She was built in
Greenwich in 1909 and was owned in
Glasgow.
British Freighter Fired Upon
Pursuing her hostile course,! the
submarine next came up with the
West Point, bound from London for
Newport News. The fate of the Brit
ish freighter was told in the follow
ing wireless despatch from her com
mander. Captain Harden, to the na
val radio station:
"British steamer West Point stop-
ped by submarine and fired upon; get
ting boat ready. Position 40:25 north,
69 west. Get cutter."
Later messages gave further details.
One stated that the steamer was be
ing shelled by the submarine when the
message was sent at 11.15 a. m. A
third message said that the vessel was
attacked at 10.45 ten miles, south of
Nantucket. This message caused a
confusion regarding the exact position
of the freighter. The steamer Kan
san picked up the distress signals of
the West Point and proceeded to her
assistance.
The West Point Sinking.
The Boston navy yard at 1.30 o'clock
received a message from the Kansan
stating that the West Point was sink
ing and that the Kansan was going to
her aid. The disabled vessel was then
55 miles distant and the Kansan was
making 12 knots.
Later a private despatch added the
information that the submarine after
stopping the West Point ordered the
crew into their small boats. The crew
abandoned the ship, which was then
torpedoed. It was in a sinking condi
tion when last reported.
Meantime the American Line steam
ship Philadelphia, which left New
York yesterday for Liverpool, had got
ten within the war zone and an S. O.
S. wireless message was received by
her commander. He held his course
for the east.
DESTROYERS BRING 216
PERSONS TO NEWPORT
Rescued From Ships Sunk Off Nan
tucket Sunday.
Newport, R. I., Oct. 9. Four des
troyers of the American flotilla came
into harbor here early today bringing
216 persons rescued from the ships
sunk off Nantucket Sunday by a Ger
man submarine. The Ericsson, the
first of the destroyers to arrive,
brought 81, the Drayton 68, the Ben
ham 38, the Jenkins 31.
Thirty-five , women and ten children
are among those on the Ericsson. This
information came by wireless in ad
vance of the actual docking of the
destroyers.
STEAMSHIP BLOOMEHSDIJK

cations Might Arise.
New York, Oct, 8. The steamship
Bloomersdijk carried a crew of fifty
men and a cargo of grain valded at
$500,000, consigned to the government
of The Netherlands, according to W.
Van Doom, an official here of the Holland-America
Line. He Intimated that
International complications might
arise.

Change on Other Battlefields.
On none of the various battle fronts
in Europe has any material change
taken place. Probably the most'im
portant development is the forced
withdrawal of the Rumanian -troops in
the region of Kronstadt, Fogoras and
iiermannstaat in the lace of superior
forces mainly made up of Germans. In
the operations the Austro-Germans
again recaptured Kronstadt, the most

val men tonight that two German sub
marines are operating off the coast.
The theory that there were two sub
marines operating was based partly
on a report that one of the vessels de
stroyed was struck by three torpedoes.
So far as known none of the crawt
was sunk by shellnre.
Only eight torpedoes could be seen
on the U-53 when she was here and
at least six torpedoes appeared to have
Deen used today.
MANY AMERICANS WERE
ON THE STEAMER STEPHANO
Was Sunk Off Nantucket Lightship
Yesterday Afternoon No Lives Lost
Newport, R. I., Oct. 8. The British
steamer Stephano, carrying nearly one
nunarea nrst and second cabin pas
sengers, including many American
tourists, was sunk off Nantucket
lightship at 4.30 p. m. today, -iresu
mably-by the German submarine IJ-n.3
The . United , States torpedo boat de
stroyer Balch reported the loss of the
liner by radio to the naval station
here, stating that the ship had been
torpedoed. The message from the de
stroyer said that the crew was safe
aboard the Balch but made no men
tion of the passengers, who. it wa
thought here, were also taken care of.
Bound From St. Johns to New York
The Stephano was in the regular
service of tne Red Cross line and was

Battery Place, New York.
Confirmation of the rescue of the
passengers by the Balch was contain
ed in a later message sent by the de
stroyer to the naval station here. It
was said that she had picked up the
passengers and later had transferred
the Americans to the destroyer Jen
kins.
Rear Admiral Knight, commandant
or tne JNarragansett naval district
said that the passengers who desired
to do so would be allowed to remain
on the warships until morning and
that every effort would be made by
omcers ana men to make them as com
fortable as possible. At the same time.
said, if any of those picked up wanted
to be set on shore, their wishes would
be complied with as promptly as pos-
sipie.
Members of the so-called Newport
society set were promipt to extend
proffers of help to the shipwrecked
passengers, through Admiral Knight.
Mrs. Robert L. Beeckman, wife of
Governor Beeckman, and Mrs. French
Vanderbilt volunteered to take care of
as many refugees as possible.
Many of the passengers on the Ste
phano are residents of New York. At
this time of year the Stephano carries
a fairly heavy passenger list, made up
of the last of the summer tourists who
spend their summers in Newfoundland
ana in the Canadian maritime pro
vinces.
Cargo Loss Not Heavy.
The cargo loss of the Stephano,
was expeotea, wouw not be very
heavy, as on her westbound voyage she
usually carried little freight. This
made up largely, as a rule of fish oil
and other fish products.

Many Rumors Afloat.
Many rumors were afloat today ln-
ciuaing one tnat a neet of German
submarines were off the coast. Anoth
er had it that the Germans had estab
lished a submarine base on the Cana
dian coast. Another speculation was
tnat supply ships were co-operating
with U-53. Those who held to the lat
ter opinion pointed out that the sub
marine after ostensibly crossing the
Atlantic unassisted arrived at New
port rully provisioned for three
months and not requlrtng fuel or so

SEVERAL STEAMSHIPS
ARE IN DANGER
ZONE.
Wireless Messages Sent Broadcast of
Presence of Submarines.
Boston, Oct. 8. Within the imme
diate zone of possible further opera
tins by the U-53 are several trans
Atlantic steamships under registry of
nations with which Germany is at war.
Also, the American Line steamer Phil
adelphia, with passengers and freight
from New York for Liverpool, is in the
waters from which reports of a Ger
man submersible have come and the
Scandinavian-American liner Fred
erick VIII is approaching that part of
the coast bound for New York from
Copenhagen.
Better known among the vessels
subject because of their registry and
their present positions to the subma
rine menace, are the French liner Es
pagne from Bordeaux for New York;
the Anchor liner Cameronia, bound to
New York from Glasgow an$, Liver
pool; and the Cunarder Aluania, only
a few tours out from New York for
Falmouth and London. Other vessels
of lesser size were reported approxi
mately In the same waters.
Most of these steamships tonight
have received wireless word sent
broadcast by radio stations to all ves
sels of the presence of the German
submersible off the New Btigland coast.
This message as sent to steamships, of
Great Britain's merchant marine, was
regarded as constituting orders to
change courses. The result was in
dicated in messages tonight that this
vessel or that was slwlnglng In shore
to be removed further from possible
contact with tho submarine and to be
within easy speeding . distance of the
three mile zone of protection.

WHITE STAR LINE
OFFICIALS ANXIOUS
Liner Canopic is Carrying 1,200 Pas
sengers and a Valuable Cargo.
Boston, Oct. 8. Although several
days removed from danger of contact
With the torpedo menace, the WTiite
Star liner Canopic, carrying 1,200
passengers and a cargo of general mer
chandise from Naples, Gibraltar and
the Azores for Boston was a subject
of serious thought by her agents here.
It wa understood they were consid
ering the forwarding or a request to
headquarter? of the line In England
fo ran ormecL convoj' for the steamer
to be drafted from the British patrol
off this coast. A change in her
course would be ordered in any event,
as soon as she could be reached by
wireless, it was said.
DOES NOT PORTEND COMPLICA
TIONS WITH GERMANY
IF RIGHTLY CONDUCTED
None of the Ships Destroyed Appear
to Have Been Attacked Without
Warning or Without Proper Meas
ures for Safety of Those Aboard.
Washington, Oct. 8. Submarine
warfare at the very doors of the Unit
ed States does not necessarily portend
further complications with Germany
so long as it is carried on within the
limitations of international law.
That is the view or offlcials Wash
ington tonight on the record of one
day's operations, i which none of the
ships destroyed appears to have been
attacked without warnmg or without
proper measures for safety of those
aboard.
Academically at least, In interna-
tional law, an allied ship destroyed by
a German submarine Just outside the
three mile limit and in sight of Amer
ican, shores is no different than a ship
destroyed in the Arctio ocean, provid
ed its destruction is accomplished In
accordance with the laws of nations
and humanity.
But despite the fact that It seems to
make little difference on which par
ticular part of the high seas Germany
prosecutes her newest submarine cam
paign, officials and diplomats see a
situation filled with so many possi
bilities that it Is almost impossible to
enumerate them so long as commerce
in and out of American ports is men
aced. May Raise Perplexing Questions.
The presence of a German subma
rine flotilla near American territorial
waters, officials fear, may raise per
plexing questions of neutraility and in
fact a most serious issue would be
raised if the operations of the sub
mersibles were carried on so near to
American ports as virtually to con
stitute a blockade.
At the outset of the war when al
lied cruisers hovered off New York so
close that commerce was impeded, the
United States, construing their oper
ations as virtually a blockade, noti
fied France and Great Britain of Its
objections and the ships were moved
farther out to sea. The possibility
of a similar situation resulting from
submarine operations is foreseen.
The destruction of half a dozen ships,
within sight , (jt ..,.the .shores of the'
United Stafe's' while American war
ships hovered near to take off the vic
tims aroused reports of German bases
and convoys. One renewed report
was that large quantities of fuel oil
had been submerged at points in te
Gulf of Mexico, on the coast of Maine
and on the Canadian coast. A con
jecture which was generally accepted
as among the most, likely possibilities
was that the sumbarines are accom
panied by merchant submersibles of
the Deutschland and Bremen type,
loaded with torpedoes and ammuni
tion. More Than One Submarine.
Many offlcials leaned to that view and
pointed out that one lone submarine
3,000 miles from a base would scarcely
have spent torpedoes so prodigally as
did Commander Rose today unless
there was a supply close at hand. Na
val officials thought it possible that
one submarine could nave done to
day's work unaided, but they inclined
strongly to the theory that probably a
flotilla of Germany's newest U boats is
o ffthe coast. It was regarded as sig.
nifiant that German embassy offlcials
while disclaming any Inrormation, said
they suspected there was more than
one submarine.
Opening of New Campaign.
It was openly declared here tonight
that today's operations marks the
opening of an organized campaign in
the waters adjacent to America against
all the commerce of the allies in gen
eral , and especially vessels carrying
munitions of war. It is expected that
attacks also will be directed at trans
ports carrying troops from Canada
and at British and French warships in
patrol duty off the coast.
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ,
ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED
Are Making Efforts to Get AM the In
formation Obtainable.
Long Branch, N. J., Oct. 8. Presi
dent Wilson and government officials
here expressed deep concern over the
sinking of steamships off the Aineri
can coast by a German submarine, but
up to a late hour no official word had
been received indicating that inter
national complications would follow.
The government officials were plain
ly worried over the situation and
made efforts to get all information
obtainable, as quickly as possible. It
was stated that the president would
pay no attention to preliminary
meagre reports and would keep his
mind open until definite information is
uspplied through official sources.
The questions of administration of
ficials centered around whether any
Americans had been lost and whether
the vessels were warned in accordance
with international law. It was stated
that a very thorough investigation
would be made but that no hasty ac
tion would be taken.
With the receipt of word of the
sinking of the vessels so .near the
American coast additional importance
was attached to the visit here tomor
row of Count von Bernstorff, the Ger
man ambassador. While the engage
ment of the ambassador with . the
president was to enable him to give
Mr. Wilson a personal letter from the
German emperor on Polish relief, it
was taken for granted that the ac
tivities of the German submarine
would be discussed. Count von Bern
storff will see the president at two
o'clock.
Count von Bernstorff has carried on
all his negotiations over submarine
warfare through Secretay Lansing and
Counsellor Polk of the state depart
ment and it was thought unlikely here
that the rwasident would do anything
to change tikis method of procedure.
Seventh Ship Sunk.
Newport, R. I., Oct. . It was re
ported early today that a seventh ship
hid been sunk. Her Identity was un
known but destroyers were searching
for her.
