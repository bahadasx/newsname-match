WASHINGTON IS

Believe Germany Will Keep

OPENING CAMPAIGN
Flotilla of U-Boats and Supply
Ship Probably Assembled
Off U. S.
Washington, Oct. 9. Possibilities of
diplomatic complications over the Ger
man submarine raid along the New
England coast seemed today to point
toward the allies as well as Germany.
State and navy officials, scanning
the unofficial reports of destruction of
Sllin -Within Rltrht nf Ainnrinnn r.1,n-A
- w. niun iv,u OtiUl CO) I
found no reason today to change their
first impression that the submarine
operations had been conducted so far
within the limitations of international
law, but they were fully alive to tho
dangerous possibilities. The destruc
tion of an American ship carrying
contraband might easily cause another
force case and any loss of life at all,
in any case, might easily reopen the
whole submarine question.
Trouble With Allies.
The threatened complication with
the allies lies in their contention that
submarines, because of their nature,
should be excluded from all neutral
ports. Today's London dispatches
quoting from the Manchester Guanlian
to the effect that such a view has
been "set out in the recent memoran
dum sent bv the allies to neutral crov.
ornments," contained the first intima
tion received here that anything in the
nature of a formal representation had
been made.
The position of the United States,
as far as it has been announced, has
been to decide on its merits the case
of each submarine entering an Ameri
can port. Inasmuch as the German
submersible which entered Newport
Saturday took no supplies, asked for
no privileges and departed almost im
mediately, it is not thought that Bhe
raised any issue.
German Base Further South.
The general opinion prevailing to
day was that with the gathering of
allied cruisers off the New England
coast the submarines would desert
that field and strike their next blows
further south. Some officials expect
ed to hear of operations in the Gult
of Mexico -where a persistent story
says a German base has been estab
lished and where the submersibles
could strike at the fleets of tank ships
carrying fuel oil to the British navy
from the Mexican fields upon which
the British depend almost entirely.
The opinion that there are several
submarines accompanied by a supply
ship, probably also a submersible, has
been strengthened by developments.
Washington, Oct. 9. Germany's ex
tension of submarine warfare to tho
western Atlantic apparently is not re
garded with apprehension by officials
here, although it is realized that It
may develop a situation presenting
new and perplexing questions of neu
trality. While formal comment was with
held today pending receipt of more de
tailed reports on the exploits of the
U-53 and her possible sister submers
ibles, there was little disposition to
believe that American interests were
affected. The fact that warning ap
parcntly had been given and thoso
aboard placed in safety, strengthened
officials ln their belief that Gormany
is following out her pledge to keep
her U-boat warfare within internation
al law.
It was pointed out that the geo
graphical proximity of the new zone ot
operations to American shores could
not in itself impair the legality of
properly conducted high seas warfare.
Serious Issue May Arise.
Should a submarine flotilla develop
a patrol, approximating a blockade
outside American ports, however, a
serious issue might arise The United
States notified Great Britain early in
the war that it regarded the continu-!
ous presence of belligerent warships
"in the offings of the great American
commercial centers" as a practice
which "may be regarded, according to
the canons of international courtesy,
as a just ground for offense, although
it may be strictly legal." The British
government replied "it was unaware
of the existence of any rules, or any
principles of International law which
render belligerent operations, where
they are ligitimate in one part of the
high seas illegitimate in another." But,
nevertheless, the British moved back
their cruisers from the Immediate vi
cinity of American territorial waters.
New Campaign Opening.
That attacks yesterday off Nantuck
et marked the opening of a campaign
in the western Atlantic is not doubted
here. Many officials believe that at
least two and possibly a half dozen or
more U-boats are assembled for the
campaign and that a supply ship, per
haps a submersible of the Deutschland
type, also is present. Whatever the
American destroyer flotilla In the area
of operations may have discovered re
garding the number of raiders will not
be disclosed, however, the navy de
' partment holding the dissemination of
such information would be unneutral.
SH! FEAR JJ BOATS
Vessels Flying Flags of Hostile
Nations in Danger of Ger
man Submarine.
New York, Oct 9. Owners, agents
and others interested in vessel near
the Atlantic coast flying the flags of
nations hostile to Germany passed a
uneasy night and today sought every
possible avenue of news regarding
their ships. Many of the vessels with
in the German U boat danger zone
carry scores of American and Euro
pean passengers, including some nota
ble in; financial, business, theatrical
and social circles.
It seemed doubtful today that the
submarine campaign would result in a
general tie-up of the shipping of the
entente nations in American ports, but
one of the most of the important
steamship companies controlling both
British and American vessels, the In
ternational Mercantile Marine com
pany, issued orders that no British
vessels of that line should leave At
lantic ports pending further orders.
Sailing Orders Stopped.
This order stopped the sal'ing orders
of the White Star. Atlantic Transport,
Leyland, Dominion and Red Star lines
and the vessels of the Whlto Star-Dominion
line saillnc for Montreal nnri
Quebec. The order will not interfere
with any of the company's vessels un
der the American flag.
Officials of the Cunard. French
ond of the Italian line declared that
their passenger vessels would sail as
usual despite the submarine menace.
All. Cunard vessels, it was pointed
out, are armed with 4.7-Inch guns and
the German submarines thus far have
avoided vessels so armed. The
Alaunla of the Cunard line, sailed irom
here Saturday after word had been re
ceived of the arrival of the U-53.
The French liners carry 3.5-inch
sains and the freight boats carry three
inch rapid fire cannon. The steamers
under the Italian flag mount three
inch guns. Danger from submarine at
tacks on the American coast Is less
than in the war zone near European
ports, officials said.
More than a scoro of passenger and
freight steamers are believed today
to be near Nantucket. Some are
bound, to New York from foreign ports
and others eastbound from here.
Many are Relieved to be laden with
war munitions.
Most important among them are the
passenger steamships Cameronla,
Dante Aligheri. Espagne. Alaunia,
Philadelphia and Kristianlafjord.
The Anchor liner Cameronla is due
here today from Liverpol with six
hundred passengers. Wireless warn
ing were sent to Captain McLean
yesterday directing him to lookout for
the U-53.

The factory was to have started on

car pushed down the grading and
the car went into the ditch and
