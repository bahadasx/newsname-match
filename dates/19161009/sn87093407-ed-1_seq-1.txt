NEWPORT, R. !., Oct. 9.—Dripping with brine,
which stood out like sweat on their steel sides from the
prodigious efforts of rescuing 216 passengers of six of
the nine torpedoed merchant ships, four United States
destroyers arrived here before dawn today, bringing the
first stories of the European war carried to America's
doorstep.
While searchlights flashed and whistles sounded,
the destroyer Kricsson —the first to arrive—nosed her
way back from the scene of operations of Germany's
U-boats.
Of the 81 persons picked up from small boats by
the Ericsson, not one was injured. Practically all, how
ever, had lost every personal belonging. They had only
