of Destroyed Vessels Warning Given in
Each Instance arid No Lives Lost
lloston, Oct. The submarine arm
of the imperial Gorman navy ravaged
shipping oil' tlio eastern coast of the
United States yesterday. Tour llrit
ish, one Dutch and one
steamers were Kent to the
left crippled derelicts off
shoals.

bottom or
Nantucket
Last night under
Hunters' moon the
of the United States
the light of the
destroyer Hot ilia
Atlantic fleet was
picking up passengers
and i rows of
the destroyed vessels
and brining
them into Newport,
li. I. So far as
known there was no loss of life,
tlu.UK.il at a late hour the crew of the
Pritish steamer Kingston had not
been accounted for.
A submarine help the American
steamer Kansnu hnmil tiom New
York for Genoa with steel for the
Italian government, hut later on es
tablish ins her identity, allowed the
American to proceed. The Kansan
came into Foston harbor late he.t
night for her usual cell there.
The hostile submarine is believed to
he the L'-F:! which paid a call to New
port Saturday and disappeared at sun
set. Some naval men, however, de
clared that least two submarines are
operating close to the American
shore, though outside the three-mile
limit.
The steamship Ploomersdyk parried
a crew of 50 men and a cargo of grain
valued at ?500,nnn, consigned to the
government of The Net horlands. ac
cording to V. Van Poorn. an official
nt New York of the I lolIaml-Aoik a
line. Ho intimated that international
complications might arise. Mr. Van
Poorn declared there was no contra
baufi on board the U'.i.otnfrAlyk. He
said the ship itself was v orPi L.5i'"i.
00'i and that the freight site , c.irrie.l
was about 1hm tons.
Tire record of submarine warring,
as brought to land by wireless dis
patches, follows:
The Strathdene. British freighter,
torpedoed and sunk off Nantucket.
Crew taken aboard Nantucket Shoals
lightship and later removed to New
port by torpedo boat destroyers. The
vessel left New York Saturday for
Pordoaux, and was attacked at (! a.
in. The West. 1'oint. Pritish freighter,
toipedoed and sunk off Nantucket.
Grew abandoned the ship . in small
boats after a warning shot from the
submarine's gun. Oi'Joors and men
were taken aboard a dest roper. The
vessel was attacked at 1-1.45 a. m. She
was bound from London for Newport
News.
Stephano, Priiish passenger liner,
plying regularly between New York
Halifax and SI. Johns, N. P. Torpe
doed Rouiheas! of Nantucket, while
bound for New Y:rk. Reported still
afloat late last night. Passenger nnd
crew, numbering about 1 k, were,
picked up by destroyer Drayton and
brought to Newport. The attack was
at 4.30 !). m.
Kingston, Pritish freighter, torpe
doed and sunk southeast of Nan
tucket. Crew missing and destroyer
searching for them. This vessel is not
accounted for in maritime registers,'
and may be the Klngstonia:). The at
tack was at (1 p. in.
nioomersdijk. Hutch freighter, tor
pedoed and sunk south of Nantucket.
Cio v taken aboard a destroyer. The
steamer was bound from New York
for Rotterdam, having sailed Saturday
night.
Christian Kuuilsrn. Ni.rweigian
freighter, -torpedoed and .sunk near
where the llloomersdi.ik went down.
Crew picked up by destroyers. The
vessel sailed from New York Satur
day for London.
The sensation created Saturday
when the U-Sil quietly 'slipped into
Newport harbor and as quietly slipped
away three hours later was less than
the shock in shipping circles when
wiieless reports of submarine attacks
began to come into the naval radio
stations .lust before noon yesterday.
With a few minutes the air was lit
erally charged with electricity as
wireless messages of warning shot, up
nnd down the coast. The submarine,
or submarines had taken a position
directly in tho steamer lanes where
they could hardly miss anything
bound in for New York, or bound cast
from that port.
Vessels of the allied nations and
neutral bottoms carrying contraband
of war scurried to get within the
three-mile limit or the American
shore. Several which were following
the outside course shifted and made
for the Inside lane. Tho Stephano of
the lied Cross lino, lovever, was
caught outside the neutral zone. The
destruction of this vessel was per
haps the biggest prize of the day.
The craft had been sold to the Rus
sian government and would have been
used as au ice-breaker after her pres
ent trip.
The passengers and crews of do-
sMT-yed vessels who are being brought
into Newport were not expected to
reach there until after midnight
Preparations to care for them had
been made, by Hour-Admiral Austin M.
Knight, commandant of the Nurragan
sett lay naal station, and llear-A 1
mlral Plbert Cleaves, commander of
tho destroyer flotilla now at Newport.
One thing that ''was puzzling nuv;.l
nun last night is why the U-."o came
into port Saturday, and another thing
that is the subject of speculation of
many outline the navy is why a de
stroyer tlotli:.. of 17 vessels was soe.t
out to rescue the crew of a single
freight steamer. The destroyers wcr.'
ordcied out at tho first report that tle.
Wcs. point had been torpedoed. The

Tho Kansan was f.i:.g the Ammean

Marino at o'clocK. Asst'i'td that
tho Kansan was an Amcricueow ned

A half hour later tlie submarine

The steamer Kansan picked up the

Later a private dispatch a bb'd tho

Washington, Oct. 8 At the llritish
Knibassy it is said today that so far
no move has been made by that Gov
ernment which can be commented up
on publicly. The llritish Arnuaosador
and the embassy ofliciald are Piking
tho news calmly and expect to see a
change in tho situation within the
next week or ton days which wi'l put
an end to tho threatened V boat raid
on Pritish shipping.
It, is said that the Pritish Admiralty
already has taken step.? to rush do
Ktro ers and other cralt to the prox
imity of tho American toast. In addi
tion o these craft the so-called sub
marine catchers, or high powered mo
tor boats armed with 'i inch guns, may
bo used to protect Pritish trade.
Scores of these vessels are being fit
tod cut abroad and there are many
mure of them in American waters now
whore they r.re. unarmed, but can
.speedily bo made serviceable.
The extent of the campaign which
Grtat Hritair; will conduct to protect
PritU'i shipping w"l depend on the
extent of the V huttt's activities. Tho
Siiidln'.r principle of the Pritish Ad
miralty is that munition phips and
grain ships mmt continue to ply be
tween tho United States and Great
Pritain even of It takes millions to as
sure their safety.
There is talk of a convoy for each
of the munition ami grain ships. This
would mean that these vessels would
bo pit ked up rs soon as they are out
ride the three rn'le limit and escorted
by destroyer or "submarine, catch
ers' across tho Atlantic or at least to
safety in ibo open sea. The average
munition ship could thou rely on Its
speed, it is explained to escape sub
marines until it reached tho protect
ingcnrilon of llritish ships on the
other side.

Mr. Vail is piesident of the Nation

been prominent in the affairs of the
summer colony here for many years.
that a submarine of similar letter and
number was active .in operations
against troop ships when the Pritish
were trying to force their way
through the Dardanelles.
Thus It was with surprise and aston
ishmcnt that naval olllcors learned the
tiny man of wall had only delayed un
til it was safely past the three-mile
limit before it began warfare against
enemy vessels.
Late tonight, naval officials, admit
ted tho destroyers sent to sea were
not alone on a mission of mercy.
Their decks were cleared for action
and each commander had strict in
sti notions to determine that the ut
most neutiality had boon maintained.
Despite tho boast of Captain Hose
that the U-53 bad fuel and provisions
aboard to last for throe months' ent!s3
local submarine ollicors believe, the
vessel was ready to descend upon :ls
pray and then make a quick dash lor
home.
Those experts place Its cruising
radius at 5.000 miles, as far as fuel
supply is concerned. There was few
who doubted tonight but that it was
already scooting; across the Atlantic
on its way to Its homo port.

RUMANIAN ARMIES
BROKEN BY W
Driven to Take Refuge in Mount
ains on Frontier
NEW EN1ENTE ALLY FRIGHTENED
Appeals to Other Nations to Check
Advance of Teutons and
Bulgarians.
London, Oct. 8. Rumania Is retreat
ing from all the Transylvanian soil
she conquered so quickly a month ago.
Her armies in southern and eastern
Transylvania, a week ago triumphant
invaders, have been forced back by
Von Falkenhayn's Germans and Atis
trlans to the mountains on the Ru
manian frontier, where they are mak
ing a stand to protect Rumania her
self from invasion.
The Rumanians have lost Kronstadt
Transylvania's largest and most im
portant city, in southeastern Transyl
vania to Van Falkonhayn and Hun
garian hussars under Gen. von Arz
have occupied Szekely Udvarhely, six
ty miles northwest of Kronstadt. In
the last ten days the Teutons have
reconquered upward of 5,oim) square
miles of Transylvanian territory. Fur
ther north, in the Georgeny Mountains
the Rumanians are retreating before
the Austrians.
These serious reverses for the Ru
manians are announced tonight by
German and Austrian statements and
admitted by a Rumanian statement
which betrays the deadly tear of the
Rumanian staff that Von Falken
hayn's armies, mostly Germans, are
about to crush the newest of the Al
lies. The Rumanian statement, shows
that the lears entertained here that
tthe Teutons' effort against Rumania
was of great importance and strength
were justiffed. Its assertion that Von
Falkonhayn has drawn troops from all
other fronts to crush Rumania is tak
en as a plea to the other Allies to
come to Rumania's rescue, if only by
attacking the weakening fronts.

GIBBONS FOR MILITARL TRAINING
Of Vital Importance for Welfare and
Security of Nation.
Washington, Oct. 8. Cardinal Gib-
bons of Paltiiuore in a letter to tho
Association for National Service,
made public tonight, presents an ear
nest idea for universal military train
ing, which, he snys, is of vital import
ance for the welfare and security of
the nation.
His letter to the secretary of the or
ganization, written from Southamp
ton, N. Y., says:
"I beg to acknowledge with many
thanks your letter informing mo that
the members of your association
were pleased to publish and circulate
far and wide Th New York Sun's edi
torial, which referred to my interview ,
on the Importance' of military truiilttg:.'
for the youth of our. country.
"I am intimately persuaded that
siich a training is .'of. vital Jrn;oi'lan; o
for the wellare. and security of the n;i
lion. The discipline wheih the youn;:
men will ticqiiirc will develop their
character and improve their physical ..
condition.
"Moreover, I am persuaded that this
military preparation will make for
peace rather than for war. For if any
foreign nation Is disposed to invade
our country it will bo deterred by tho
recognition 0" tho fact that our coun
try Is prepared for every emergency
Another consideration is that tho few
years our youth will spend in military
discipline will not indefinitely with
draw them from thn active and pacific,
pursuits of life.'
