STURM RE
Vas the Bill Paid Anyway?
er, the Democra
Sheriff i
A letter haB been received in the
fflee of the West Virginian which
elates an incident of much imporince
in the pending political camaign
that happened during the Winer
of 1914. The letter is from a
lan of undoubted veracity and the
ruth of the incident has been subtantiated
by other persona who were
resent at the time. While there is
o evidence to show that the padded
III mentioned was allowed by the
ounty court at that time, yet the InIdent
serves to demonstrate how the
onest and self-respecting Demorats
of the county look askance at
le manner in which the Democratic
ang handles the taxpayers' money.
The letter explains Itself and we
rlnt it as follows with the exception
f some portions that had no relation
3 the incident, but concerned other
latters not relative to political afilrs:
FAIRMONT, Oct. 7.?[Editor
West Virginian],?This discussion
about costs and unnecessary expenses
of the connty court recalls
to my mind some matters which
I wish to tell you, although such
things may not be new to you.
Mr. Sturm, who superintends
the county poor farm, is in my
estimation a square man. He
wanted to have cement walks and
retaining walls built at the county
home and to get this done as
cheaply as possible for the county,
used the labor of Inmates of
the home largely. This was nearly
all done during the winter of
1914. That winter 1 was working
as a carpenter on the new
barn there.
Among those present at the
time were the other carpenters,
Alt Landis of Norwood, who used
to own bloodhounds; Ben Wilson
of Hoult (not the fleet-footed
Ben) and others. We were all
r to first. No runs, two hits, no erors.
Boston?Thomas up. Out first to

Can Tell. ? fjpjjf '

eating dinner by the furnace In
the baBement
Mr. Sturm was complaining. He
had been to town and a blanket
sbeet bill had been presented by
the court for his 0. K. covering
expenses of the work done. To
use his words it was as "big as
that furnace door." and he said
lie refused to O. K. It until corrected.
Said Mr. Sturm. "While our
team was hauling cement from
the Wall Plaster company plant.
George Lily's team was also hauling
cement to one of his contracts.
This bill covered a lot of bags of
cement hauled by Lily's team for
use of the county farm. There
was another bill of Lily's for team
hauling to county farm. "I told
the county clerk that Oeorge Lily
never hauled a load, our own team
hauled it all and also I had a
memorandum of every bag wfe got
and I would only O. K. that
amount and no more."
Mr. Sturm, who Is of course a
good Democrat, said that he could
not-understand It, "It must have
been a mistake some way and that
Lily would not do It on purpose.
Supposed as Lily was hauling at
the same time the Wall Plaster
people had taken It for granted
that It was all for the Home."
Landls said: "Aw com off
now, Sturm, you are not that Innocent
and easily fooled. You know
that It Is an old trick of George's
to make the county pay for a lot
of stuff for his own contract work
and the Wall Plaster people don't
jump to cdncluslons and make
bills without any Information, besides
how do you account for the
bill for hauling In Lily's honor?"
And he could not account for It.
"As I said I give this for what
It may be worth.".
