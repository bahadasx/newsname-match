Only Danger is That An Amer
ican May Fall a Victim to
Sub Warfare Along
Atlantic Coast.
International News Servi-o:
WASIIINCiTdN, Oct. 'J. Trans
fer of Germany's submarine warfare
to the Atlantic, east of the American
coast, caused the deepest concern
in oilicial circles today. The situa
tion admittedly is nearly the most
serious of the present Kuropean
war so far as the United States is
concerned. At any moment the
word may come that an American
citizen has fallen victim to the new
situation. And officials very frankly
say that such a development must
mean instant dismissal of the Her
man ambassador from the United
States.
liy direct orders from Pres-'t Wil
son from Shadow Iiwn all of the
higher officials here now refuse to
discuss the situation save in the
most general terms. The state de
partment has made it plain that so
far as the known situation is con
cerned, CJerniany is as much within
her rights in operating her sun-
marines off the Xew KnI ind coast
as she was in sinking enemy ships
in the waters of the Hritinh hies so
loni? a.s the doctrines of vis.tation
and search are observed. Pdit the
dancer, it is pointed out. is r:at an
American vessel or citize'i may yet
fall victim in disre.car.I af the lim
itations of international law. This
dancer is very' PrcSf'nt and real, of
ficials say.
Wilson ticks Information.
AH of the information reaching
here is beim; sent immediately to
the president at Shadow Iiwn.
Comprehensive reports from Ad
miral Kriicht. commandant at New
port, dealing with the sinkings to
date are alone the lines covered by
the press dispatches. He says that
every possible effort is beim? made
to rcrue the passengers and crew's
of all vessels that fall victims.
Count von Ilernstorff, the flerman
ambassador, is at Shadow I. n to
day. The ostensible reason ior his
visit to 1'res't Wilson is to present
an autographed letter from the
kaiser dealing with the Polish re
lief question. Hut there i- no doubt
here that the president will make it
plain that the bringing- of submarine
warfare by Germany rieht to the
very doors of the United States is
more than unwelcome.
There is little doubt in the minds
of o'licials here that the president
will make that plain that while such
action may he strictly legal so far
as the written law is concerned it is
very close to unfriendly when judg
ed by the complication." that may
aris?.
IlritMi (initials silent.
Officials at the Hritish embassy
refused to make a statement re
garding what action has been taken
to protect entente shipping from this
menace. It is understood in diplo
matic circles here that a flotilla of
destroyers and several fast cruisers
have been sent from the Hritish
naval base at St. Johns and Hermuda
to patrol the American coast. These
vessels will try to locate the U-5.1
and her consorts it being accepted
that there are at least two and per
haps more German submarines
operating in American waters and
either sink them or start them back
toward their home bases.
The Hritish a.l French govern
ments, their officials here say. are
to press ait ion to have the United
States make a rule that German sub
marines will hereafter be excluded
from American ports.

that Gen. -Carranz-Vs wife and two

Arredondo is the ambassador

cated that the Mexicans were pre
pared to waive, for the time Peine at
least, the demand for the immediate
withdrawal of Maj. Gen. I'ershine's

ground for the belief that political
