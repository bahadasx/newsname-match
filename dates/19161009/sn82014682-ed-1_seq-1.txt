BRAVES' PARK, Boston, Mass,
Oct 9. Del Gainer of Elkins. West
Virginia, placed that hamlet on the
map thla afternoon .when ha steypcul
t un to the Dlate In th 14th Inning of,
the came betwpen the Boston Red Sox j
and Brooklyn Dodgere and aent cut a
. hard, aafe drive, uhlch acored McNal
ly and gave the Bostott team a victory
' .In pertapa the greatest world' series
contest ever staged. The score was
2 tO 1. , -
It waa one of the most spectacular
contests ever played since the world'a
: classic has been Inaugurated, and
more than 40,000 fans were on their
toes almost every minute, of the game.
Fielding such as is seldom seen in a
- championship contest waa featured,
' and the. pitching by the two. young
southpaws. Smith and Ruth, set Bos
ton mad. Neither pitcher waa figured
upon to do much this series, but it was
the greatest contest between hurlers
that the Hub City has ever witnessed.
"Game Fight Throughout
; There were many heroes in today'a
' game, and the losers are entitled to
credit ? puking a game fight
'," thrcugl'iut it there were any breaks
today U wearers of the Red Hose
had them, find it was this and fast
fielding by the Boston defense that
kept the Brooklyn team from winning?
Babe" Ruth pitched masterful bail
:" for Boston throughout and as Jhil
game continued he grew stronger, and
for the last six innings not a Brooklyn
batsman secured a hit Ruth has been
a big factor In Boston's rush to the
r pennant and the- fans wantel the
young 6duthpaw to .enter a contest
Carrigan sent him in; and today the
Boston fans are cheering ; his name.
- Kuth allowed but six hits during the
14 innings and these were scattered.
Scott la Great
To Everett Scott' the light-hitting
shortstop, roes much of the credit for
victory. Throughout the entire game
, Scott played sensational ball. When
ver Brooklyn threatened the Red Sox
. Infieider would make sensational stops
and throws of grounders, and no one
in Boston will believe that he isn't
the best of shortstops 'today. In the
- 14th inning Johnston hit a sharp drive
which Scott handled, and a moment
later he made a great play of SJyers
hard-hit ball. It was his play as much
s: ns that of Ruth and Gainer which gave
Boston the victory. V-
Scott has never been considered
v hard hitter but he was the man in the
Pinch today. It was his triple to deep
center in the third inning which gave
the Boston team their first run, and
later lc the tenth Scott started the
inning bV hitting, safely. He played
treat ht-A and "Great Scott' is the
SlogariUn the Hub City this arternoon.
Boaton' the Gainer
Del Gainer, ex-Tiger, was the. man
' In the pinch today, and he responded
when ho came to bat for Larry Gard
ner. Hoblitxel tad worked Smith for
a pass for the fourth time during the
day, and Duffy Lewis followed with a
sacrifice hit in the fourteenth Inning.
Larry Gardner w.aa the next man up,
v and the crowd yelled for Larry to hit
it out But Larry didnt come up. Car
rigan has always had a happy faculty
for picking out pinch-hitters, and he
did it again today successfully.
Gardner has been. hitting well this
Tear, and very few faha believed that
he would be jerked. Inasmuch as he
is the only .300 hitter on the team.
But Gainer had delivered before in
. the pinches, and the crowd was on its
