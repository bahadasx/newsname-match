Daniels Gives a Preliminary
Report British Forecast
Trouble for America.
Bj United rrns.
BOSTON, Oct. 9 The trans-Atlantic
lane over which has flowed a steady
stream of munitions and supplies for
the Allied powers is in the grasp ot
the submarines of the Kaiser's navy
today.
Six merchantment are known to lie
on the ocean's bottom south of Nan
tucket, victims of German submer
sibles, and late reports are that two,
and possibly three, more may have
been sunk.
The vessels positively known to
have been destrocd are:
The Stephano. 2,143 tons. British,
St. Johns, Newfoundland, to New
York.
The Strathdene. 4,300 tons, British;
New Vork to Bordeaux.
The West Point, no tonnage given,
British; London to Newport News.
The Kingston, no tonnage given,
British; destination not given.
Christian Knudson, 2,500 tons, Nor
wegian; destination not given.
The Bloomersdijk, 3,201 tons,
Dutch; New York to Rotterdam.
The passengers and crews of all
the vessels are known to have been
rescued, with the exception of those
of the Kingston. The fate of the men
on this ship is not known here.
Allied warships are now closing in
upon Germany's new submarine zone.
The crackling wireless of three Brit
ish cruisers is mingled with that of
American destroyers out upon the
tea on missions of mercy and rescue.
Reports to Nantucket, Newport and
here indicate there is certainly more
than one submersible striking terror
along the great international water
way. The officers of the steamer Kansan,
vihich arrived this afternoon, after
being held up by a submarine yester
day, indicated their belief that two of
Germany's great U-boats are operating
at America's portals.
At Nantucket a report has been
picked up that two or three subma
rines are in action and that the num
Jer of ships sunk is now eight or nine.
The crew of the steamer Kingston
was still missing late this afternoon.
There is hope that the men from
this ship may still be adrift or have
been picked up by some destroyer
which has not j et reported.
A total of 21C survivors landed at
Newport from four American destroy
ers. Included among the passengers
were many women and fourteen
babies.
There is no doubt in shipping cir
cles that Germany's plans for inter
cepting munitions-carrying ships
were carefully laid. Eluding the Al
lied ships the submersibles have es
tablished themselves squarely in the
path of practically all Atlantic ships.
The regular lane recognized by all
navigators is off Nantucket light. It
is there that the monsters of the
Kaiser's submersible force are work
ing. They are in a position to strike
any kind of ship they desire.
One of the mysteries of the new un
dersea campaign is the escape of the!
steamer Kansan, flying the American
Bag, chartered by the French govern
ment and carrying a large quantity
of munitions.

U-boat activity off the American coast
was forecast by the Daily Chroniclo
this afternoon. Counter measures by
the Allies will hamper American
trade and also make it "unhealthy"
for American submersibles off the
coast of the United States, the news
paper stated.
"The United States dis.i?roed with
us when it admitted the Deutschland,
but the disagreement is much sharper
when it admits a craft like the U-53,"
said the Chronicle. "What is to pre
vent the U-53 belong replenished at
American ports and practically using
the American coast as a base for
preying on French and British
steamers?
"Obviously if Germany is permitted
to wage such a war along the United
States coast we must make counter
measures. American trade will be
hampered, and it will become- very
unhealthy not only for German 'but
for American submarines."
TRADE WEEK STARTS
First Day of Campaign Is
Marked by Encouraging
Reports from Merchants.
Trade Week is here. The first day
ui me weeK set asiae lor an extensive
I
campaign to increase the out-of-town
trade in Columbia through co-opera-:
tion between the Daily Missourian and ,
the leading merchants of the city have
passed. Although great results were
not expected thc first day, sufficient
returns have been reported to show
that a large amount of out-of-town
trade will be received before the end,turc- 0ur Biblc school was exceed
of the week.
Customers came from Rocheport,
Millersburg, Huntsdale, Woodland
ville, and rural routes of Columbia. "I
consider the Trade Week idea a very
good method of increasing out-of-town
trade, and expect still better results
the remainder of the week," said Mr.
Frcdcndall this afternoon.
Several women made trips to Co
lumbia. "There is no reason why Co
lumbia merchants should not derive
much benefit from Trade Week," said
Mr. Miller. "I am heartily in favor
of the plan and hope to sec it carried
out from now on each year. There
is a big field around Columbia which
can and should be supplied with thc
latest and best by Columbia mer
chants." The first customer appearing at the
E. H. Guitar shoe store this morning
was a young man from Centralla who
had come to the city on the first train.
One customer from Millersburg was
reported this afternoon at thc Smith
Millinery Shop, showing that the
women are not missing the opportuni
ty to make their purchases go toward
paying their railroad fare.
Sales to two customers from Ash
land and Alma netted over a large
amount for the Victor Barth Clothing
Company on the first day of Trade
Week. "Maybe we had more out-of-town
customers than that," said Mr.
Barth. "We have a considerable
amount of trade from people not liv
ing in Columbia, and are glad to boost
any plan to increase the number of
people coming to Columbia to shop."
All the stores in the Trade Week
list were not seen. General belief on
the part of the leading merchants is
that thc number of calls for rebate
slips will increase each day.

said. "The student Bible school
classes totaled 618. It was necessary
to carry chairs into the auditorium to

Church, spoke oof thc Sunday. "It
was an example of good, systematic
work and what we can do in the fu-
ingly large, all classes being well fill

to capacity in the morning."
"The results of the campaign did
not come up to my expectations," said
the Rev. T. W. Young, pastor of the
Baptist Church. "We had no in
crease In students. I rather think' the
attendance was smaller than usual.
Our Bible classes were well attended,
with 487 present, but there was light
attendance at the other meetings. I
cannot account for the smaller crowd.
Our workers were faithful and did all
that was possible."
Representatives of thc other
churches made favorable reports on
the result of the campaign. The pres
ent campaign is the first for a Stu
dent Sunday. One hundred fifty
workers canvassed the city, accom
panied by students.
The campaign was under the direc

Initiation Fee Is $150 An
nual Dues $40 Women
Also Join.
f"If I was asked for advice in
ajfew "words to any town con
sidering a country club, I would
merely say, 'start something.'
Have something tangible to
work on and the other problems
may be easily solved as the
present themselves."
P. H. IIopLlns. one of the foun
ders and charter members of the
Muskogee, Okla., Town and Country
Club.
What may be accomplished in
building a country club Is Illustrated
by the Muskogee, Okla, Town and
Country Club one of the better known
and oldest club organizations of that
state. The club was first founded as
a riding and hunting club, when the
town was no larger than Columbia.
The building and site of an old fort
was secured as a club house. The
giowing interest of thc members of
thc first club in golf brought up the
organization of a country golf club.
In 1903 fifty-three men of Mus
kogee organized. the Muskogee Town
and Country Club. They had no def
inite plans but merely those of form
ing such an organization. They pick
ed a site, elected officers, and drew up
by-laws and papers of incorporation.
9a Juno M, 1903 the club was Incor
porated in Indian Territory.
Then its growth began. The ground
was improved by the laving out of
the golf course. There was a large
lake on the grounds which was im
proved in such a-way as to makc it a
boating place and a hazard for one of
the holes of the course. The 1915
valuation of the club gives the mone
tary value of the ground as more than
$18,000. The club now has a clubhouse
with a grill, three bed rooms for
guests, ladies rooms, a large living
room for dancing and receptions, and
others. The club house is valued at
more than $7,000. The present mem
bership of the club, including all di
visions is more than 200.
How The Club Started.
The start of the club was not on
this large scale. The club property
now valued at more than $30,000 was
begun with $6,000. The membership
or initiation fee first charged the
members of the club and later made
permanent was $150. An annual as-
sessment of $10 was made payable
quarterly in advance. In addition to
these, lockers are rented by the quar
ters, and all other expenses incurred
by the members in the grill or else
where are charged to their accounts.
Members now may be suspended for
non-payment of dues.
The memberships in the club are
transferable only with the consent of
the club members. The active mem
bership is limited to 200. The club
has four regular types of members,
resident, non-resident, junior and
women members. The women mem
bers are those having no relatives who
are members of the club and who
could not otherwise have the privilege
of the club.
That the club maintains itself suc
cessfully in a financial way Is evi
dent because of its thirteen years of
existence. At its start and at pres
ent, the club memberships have not
entirely paid for the improvement of
thc golf course, an 18-hole course, the
site and the erection of the club
house. Bonds to the amount of $10,
000 have been issued and there is a
first mortgage upon the club for $4,
000. The management of the club is in
the hands of a president, a vice-presi-
llOnt .,,.A .. .... t a ......a., n.,.4 ntf.l,t

president appoints each year a house
committee, an outdoor sports commit
tee, a finance committee, a general en
tertainment committee, an executive
committee, and an auditing commit-
tee. The secretary-treasurer is placed
under bond and acts as the manager
Of the Club.

K.L GILCHRIST IS DEAD
An Operation Proves Fatal
for Former Tiger Foot
ball Star.
A letter to Coach Brewer says that
K. L. Gilchrist, Tiger football star of
1908 and '09 and Captain of U. S.
Naval Academy team in 1913, died last
week at the Navy Hospital, Mare Is
land, N. Y. Gilchrist entered the hos
pital to be operated on. The first op
eration was unsuccessful and a sec
ond one was performed. It proved
fatal.
Gilchrist was one of the greatest
football players that ever carried
Missouri's colors and is remembered
for his great work in the Kansas
game in 1909. He came to the Uni
versity from his home in Lathrop,
Mo., in 1907 and entered the School
of Engineering. He played in the
Freshman team of that fall. The fol
lowing year he played on the Varsity
at end and half back. He was in
every game that year. The following
year found Gilchrist at the Rolla
School of Mines. Late in the fall he
left Rolla and came to Missouri in
time to get into the historic battle
with Kansas that jear. Missouri
won the game 12-G and the Tiger star
was a great factor in the winning.
In 1910 "Gilly" received an appoint
ment to the United States Naval
Academy at Annapolis, Md., and was
graduated in 1913. He made the navy
team his first year and played the
J. jour j earg he was in the school.
The former Tiger football star was
an all-around athlete at Annapolis,
being the champion heavyweight
wrestler and boxer of the school. As
these two sports are very poplar at
the Xavy school the honor was very
difficult in attaining.
Being graduated from the Naval
Academy in 1913 Gilchrist was put in
service immediately. He served up
until the time he entered the hospital
at Mare Island.
Gilchrist is remembered by old Mis
souri fans as a hard working football
player, his one drawback being a
fiery temper. He was popular with
the student body and with his fellow
players and his progress and success
at Annapolis was watched closely by
Valley football followers.
