"One ?f the most important mean
ures passed at the 1916 session of the
legislature was the Toole act to pro
vide for the teaching of agriculture
in the public schools," said J. E
Swearingen, state superintendent ol
education.
"Such a law has been urged and
discussed for years. Mr. Toole has
beer, an insistent advocate of tht
policy, in and out of the legislature
The proposal was dlpcussed through

1914.
"The establishment of county or dis

states has proved expensive. Tht

"In the fall of 1914. Prof. J. M

country schools. The principals co
operated heartily by aiding him ir
class room instruction and filed ex

nounced successful by men like D. R
Coker, Bright Williamson. L. W. Dick

The act was approved March 27

by a large number of advocates of
the new county. The new unit will be j
made up from parts of Edgefield, Abbeville

carried after a fight extending over a
period of 20 years. Citizens of the
new county are making arrangements ;
for a celebration at McCormick. They

ning to attend the celebration. The
governor was forced to decline be- 1
cause of other engagements.

. appeal was taken to the state board
, of canvassers and the election was declared
to have been legally held. Then .
f th i case was carried on to the supreme i
court. After hearing the arguments (
I and giving the matter much considera
( tlon the five justices of the supreme

WILSON COMPLETES'
NOTE TO GERMANY
TO CONTINE FRIENDLY RELATIONS
GERMANY MUST MAKE
IMMEDIATE CHANGES.
WANT NO MORE QUIBBLING
Imperial Government Must Alter Submarine
Policy at Once Says Presl
dent's Most Vigorous Note.
"Washington.?The communication
which he has drafted as the last word
of the United States to Germany on
the submarine issue, was completed by
President Wilson.
The document reviews Germany's
submarine activities since the L.us?
tania was sunk almost a year ago.
and makes plain that only an immediate
change in the German policy
can make possible the continuance of
friendly relations between the two
nations.
As the president was putting the
finishing touches to the note, on
which he and Secretary Lansing had
been working for nearly a week, official
word was received by the state
department that the lives of two
Americans had been endangered by
an attack on the Russian bark Imperator
by an Austrian submarine. Clark
Bailey Hurst. American consul general
at Barcelona, Spain, who sent the
report said the attack was without
warning. One of the American citizens
on board was wounded by shrapnel
shells fired by the submarine.
A full l..?M??
- U..V.BOl.UU ? I"' |
was ordered at once by the state department
If the consul general's report
Is borne out it is possible that representations
similar to those about to
be made to Germany will be sent to
Austria-Hungary.
As soon as the president had finished
the communication to Germany,
he directed that Senator Stone, chairman
of the senate foreign relations
committee, be invited to the White
House to be informed of the intentions
of the administration.
The President was represented as
being determined to force the question
to a speedy settlement, without
quibbling or diplomatic discussions.

EXCUSE FOR APPEAL TO ARMS
Washington.?President Wilson in
an address welcoming the Daughters
of the American Revolution gathered
hoe/x f/v. U ~ I 1
unc mi mru oiinuui congress, ueciared
that the only excuse America ever
can have for the assertion of her physical
force is that It be done in behalf
of humanity.
He was speaking of the purpose of
the Republic?born to serve the rest
of the world just as much as herself?
and had just said that the nations
will have forgotten her traditions
whenever she fights merely for herself
under such circumstances as will
show she has forgotten to fight for
all mankind.
The president was enthusiastically ;
applauded. When he was introduced j
by Mrs. William Cummings Story, !
president general of the organization. :
the audience stood and cheered, and ,
many of the women waved American '
flags.

Mr Baker announced later that he

here to point out that the clash

Reports from Chihuahua Are Reaard- I

Officials at Ed Paso.
El Paso. Texas.?Francisco Villa is
(lead and his body, disinterred some
days after his burial, is in possession
of the Carranza troops, according to
a series of telegraphic messages received
in Juarez by the Mexican officials.
For more than a week reports that
Villa had died from wounds have
been current here and in Juarez. Latest
accounts were the most circumstantial
and apparently reliable yet
received. They were accepted with
reserve by American officials including
General Bell, but Mexican officials
expressed confidence in their reliability.
The dispatcher of the Mexican
Northwestern Railroad at Juarez reported
to General Gavira. Carranza
commander at Juarez, that he had
heard a conversation on the telegraph
wire to the effect that Villa's body was
in the hands of the Carranza troops.
General Garvira notified Consul
Garcia here who rushed messages to
the telegraph operators at Madera
1 and Cushihutriahic asking for cons
firmatlon. The Madera and Cusihuirahie
answered confirming the report
' and stating the body was being taken
to Chihuahua.
The telegraph operator at San Antonio.

VILLA BAND TAKES 10WN
REPUTED DEAD COMES TO LIFE
AND SACKS TOWN OF SIERRA
MOJADA.
Believe Villa Himself Lead the Raid
and is 200 Miles From the Ameri
can i roops.
EI Paso, Texas.?A band of Villa
followers numbering several hundred
and possibly a thousand, have sucked
Sierra Mojada, five miles across the
Coaliuila line and SO miles east of
Jiminez, destroying many thousands 1
of dollars' worth of American property
and looting the town of everything of
value.
This news, which may prove to be |
of the highest importance as it is believed
possible Villa himself was
among the raiders, was received here
by the representative of one of the
largest mining concerns in Mexico and
is accepted by him as authentic.
The bandits made their attack on
the town on April 5. They came
from Escalon. a junction point on the
Mexican National Railroad. HO miles
southeast of Jiminez and about an
equal distance southwest of Sierra
Mojada, which has its connection by
the Mexican Northern Railroad. On ,
their way to Sierra Mojada they sacked
the small town of Corrilo.
The belief that Villa himself may
oe directing the operations of the
bandits is supported by a report received
from Ojinaga stating that Colonel
Rajas. tin- commander, had information
that Villa bad doulded in his
tracks and was ItOO miles southwest of
t liat town.
Sierra Mojada is HO miles east of
the nearest point at which American
troops are known to be.

TO BE CONTINUED
PENDING OUTCOME OF DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS WITH CARRANZA
GOVERNMENT.
NO NEW ORDERS ARE ISSUED
Carranza Military Forces Must Prove
Their Ability to Stop Brigandage
on the Border States.
Washington. The United States is
prepared to treat with General Carranza
as proposed in his note for the
withdrawal of American troops from
Mexico. Pending the outcome of the
diplomatic negotiations, however, the
status of the expedition will remain
unchanged and the pursuit of Villa
continue.
This was the situation officially
stated after President Wilson and his
Cabinet had considered the new
phases of the Mexican problem raised
by General Carranza's communication.
Secretary Lansing said he was
prepared to take up the matter with
the ile facto government, but would
not indicate when a reply might be
sent. Secretary Baker said no new
orders had been sent to General Funston
and that none were under contemplation.
Both Secretaries said there had
been no change in the policy of the
Administration which prompted the
pursuit of Villa.
Secretary Lansing would not say
whether he was prepared to negotiate
with the de facto government for the
possible fixing of a date for withdrawal
of American troops. He indicated
that the time element of any
agreement would be based on what
developed in the pursuit of the bandits.
As the Administration's attitude
is understood here, a satisfactory demonstration
by the Carranza military
forces of their ability to stop all brigandage
in the border states would see
the object of the American expedition
accomplished.
Senator Stone, chairman of the For
mkh notations committee, is thought
to have voiced tiie Administration
view to the senate, speaking after a
conference with Secretary Lansing.
"The problem confronting this government."
the Senator said, "is how
long it would he wise to keep an expeditionary
force in Mexico. If we
adhere to our policy towards Mexico,
we cannot keep the army there. To
my mind the only alternative to withdrawing
the troops sooner or later is
intervention."
SENATE VOTES 43 TO 22

Smith Amendment Carries $15,000,000
For Government's Proposed Venture
Washington.- The senate adopted

$15,000,000 for a government nitrate
plant. The vote was 42 t?? 22.
This notion disposed of the second
big tight in the Senate over the senate
substitute for the house army reorganization
bill.
Senator Smith's amendment provides
for the sale of Panama Canal
bonds for raising the required $15,000.000
and the president is authorized to
designate not more than five waterpower
sites for power plants. When
products of these plants, which will be
operated exclusively by the government
.are not needed for manufacture
of munitions of war the surplus could
be disposed of by the secretary of war
for fertilizer.
RUSSIANS CLAIM DEFEAT
