J. N. Hamilton Retiring
It is with the smcerest regret
t that the students learn of Supt.
'nHamilton's intention to leave
Meade High School. During the
five years he has been in Meade
he has built up the most success
f ul school Meade has ever bad.
It is to Mr. Hamilton that Meade
High School feels indebted for
her high school paper, for the
cafeteria, and much of her suc
cess in athletics during the past.
We know bis valuable assistance
and untiring enthusiasm were
instrumental factors in securing
for Meade the new school build
ing. Mr. Hamilton made the follow
ing statement in reply to the
question of why he was leaving:
"Please ask me an easier ques
tion. "It might be embarrassing
to answer, you know. However,
it is a fact that I am not and will
. not be an applicant for the posi-
' tinn 'Phia IQ final T aatr if nnf
because of any known dissatis
faction. Last year when elected,
I told the board that I would not
again be a candidate for the po
sition. My reason for making
thatstatement was that I believed
.it then, and I belive it now, to be
' best for boh the school and my
self if I could leave at a time when
, affairs were moving smoothly.
I have spent fiye'years here and
it has been my earnest desire
that I might leave when every
thing was in an approximate har
tnony and that my last efforts
, might be of a constructive na
ture. Of course I regret to leave the
Meade schools. They mean
much. In fact about everything
1 have accomplished in the few
years since I have left college is
bound up in the schools both
present and future. Donotthink
that I pose as a martyr to the
canse of education either. I hate
; been paid for my work in Meade
and my earnest hope is that I
have returned value received. In
quitting the work here, I am
; frank enough to say that I do it
with the purpose of bettering
myself.
Iam not at all certain what I
, shall do. Please tell the stud
ents not to celebrate ' my goiog
too early for I may yet decide to
remain in Meade in some other
work. Please also remember
that there is six more weeks of
school and I expect to serve my
tim: out. "Meade Tattler.

rector of the past two years, has

Do You Know
Do you know that our httle
theatre has attracted over six
thousand two hundred people

restaurant, store, and garage
share the success of the theatre?
Do you know that good, clean,
wholesome amusement keeps a
city tuned up to the better things
of life?
Do you know that our service

by a personal trial?

Our Choir has been preparing

next Sunday and the pastor will
deal with topics in keeping with
the thought of the day.
After a forced absence from
all our services for almost a year,
Sister M. E. Read, was with us
again last Sunday morning. We
all rejoiced because she was so
much improved in health and
was with us in the hour of public
worship. She has suffered much
and long, but has borne it all
without complaint or a murmur.
Her influence among strangers
has been of such a strong char
acter that only eternity can re
veal its value in the work of the
kingdom.
Let us always "Walk worthy
of the vocation wbere-witb ye are
called."

A Correction
A few weeks ago an article ap
peared in this paper, regarding
a prairie fire, the origin of which
it was stated therein was from a
straw stack, burned on the Theis
ranch, the day before. This
was the information brought to
this office at the time of the fire,
but we have since learnrd that
the management of the Theis
ranch bad nothing to do with the
fire; that it started from a straw
stack just across the line .from
the ranch, or to be exact, on the
farm of S. P. Currier,' so in jus
tice to Mr. Theis, and also to the
manager of the ranch, Mr. John
Craig, we gladly make this cor
rection. Mesdames McLean and Ham
ilton were hostesses to the Arena
Club, at the home of .the former,
last Monday evening. The sub
iect for the meeting The Coast
Country was ably bandied by
ootn jaaies, eacn Having prepared
excellent papers and a pictorial
description or toe r acinc Coast.
Reverend and Mrs. Hunt added
to the pleasures of the evening
with the assistance of the Edison
Mesdames McLean and Hamil
ton and Miss Jamie Stamner
served dainty refreshments to
me guests.
Spring Musical Festival
Hutchinson's Annual Spring
Music Festival will be held next
week Easter week on Monday
Tuesday, and Wednesday April
24 to 26.
This Music Festival is of int
erest to all in southwestern Kan
sat. for it is the first attempt, on
a big scale, to bring the best in
strumental and vocal music in
the world to this section at what
might well be called "vaudeville
prices."
The New York Philharmonic
orchestra, Josef Stransky, con
ductor, will give three concerts
during the Festival; 'Monday
evening, Tuesday afternoon, and
Tuesday evening. A fourth con
cert will be given on Wednesday
evening, featuring the . Philhar
monic quartet of vocal artists,
Eleanor Cochran, soprano; Ruth
Towosend, contralto; Royal Dad
mun, baritone and Theo Karle,
tenor.
Season tickets, with reserved
seats, and transferable so that
anyone may use them are being
sold for the four concerts for $2
for the best seats. Single con
cert tickets, reserved, are $1.50
and $1, and unreserved (second
balcony), 50 cents.
The Hutchinson Municipal
Chorus, and Commercial Club
are behind the Festival. No
profit is made from it; Conven
tion ball is given free by the city
and in this way it is possible for
Hutchinson to bring this fam
bus arcbestra and grand opera
artisis to the people of the so'uth
west at such prices.
In connection with the orches
tra concert Tuesday night, the
Hutchinson Municipal Chorus
will render the cantata, "Hia
watha's wedding Feast" with the
orchestra accompaniment.

bis story about his movements
the afternoon of the Byers mur
der and has not made a denial
that he saw the teacher that af

again in explanation of his pro
test against the statement cred
ited to him.
He still adheres to his original
story about seeing Miss Byers
as she was coming from her
school house toward her board
ing house, but as to the time she
was killed, whether it was a few
minuses after she passed out of
his sight or not, he declares he

minutes before she was killed"

the lawyer wrote' Ford, county
officials that be would be here in
time for the trial.
"I'll not object to going to trial
in Grant county if the officials
there can guarantee me a fair
trial," Sweet said today. "I
talked with County Attorney
Stubbs of Grant county about it.
He said be would do all he could
to see that I bad a fair chance,
but I don't believe they can find
an impartial jury in that county.
I don't care where they try me
and I'm not afraid to go to trial
if I think I will have a fair
chance." Sweet expects to go
