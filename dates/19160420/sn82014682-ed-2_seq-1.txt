WASHINGTON, D. C April 20.
Senator Hardwick desires time to op
pose the absolute repeal of the "free
sugar" plan, which ia one of the rea
sons for allowing time far debate on
Saturday. The adoption of the report
accepting the house bill Is considered
certain, following the two-to-one vote
of the Democratic caucus to accept
the house proposition and make no
further fight for a time limit of four
years. C. S. ALBERT.
This action, following; the agree
