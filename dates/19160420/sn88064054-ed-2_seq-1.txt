PULIt!L FlUE IS DEAD
Charles K. Fulua, manager of
Ex-Governor Sanders campaigns
and at the time of his death, acting
as his private secretary, died in the
French Hospital at New Orleans at
6 o'clock Tuesday morning. Death
was due to a complication of dis
e1ases, following' an operation. He
started his political career as a boy
when he was a Page in the legisla
ture and his acquaintance with men
and his knowledge of state condi
tions made him one d, the best
political men of the state. Until
the operation he took an active
part in the Plesasant campaign.
When he realized that he had only
a short time to live, lie t,)ld friends
that he w,'as anxious to live until he

known that the conerin is figurini
on erecting a plant fromn which they
will make pine oil and tars frmn

pine stumps that are around this
section of the state it is believed
that Bogalusa stands a good chance
of securing the plant.

The title of the picture tonight is
"Blue Blood and Black Skin." It's
a black face play that will keep
you in a scream from the time the
first reel is started until the L. K. O.

the L. K. 0. for a year and that is
going some to those who know
what L. K. 0. means for fun.
On Monday evening "Secret

ing Helen Ware, will be shown.
there is a triple love story, beautiful
scenerios, a series of climnaxs that
are certain to make you appreciate
this famous Bluebird feature as oine
of the best ever shown in Bogalusa.
To attempt to go into details with
the picture would require a column
of space to do justice. See the
picture next Monday evening.

Two men were killed, three, had
narrow escape from death, traffic
was delayed for several hours, an
engine was damaged and a caboose

engineer and Joe Hampton fireman,
crushed into the rear of regular
freight No. 51, in charge of Con
ductor George Potter and Engineer
C. V. Fowler. The accident was
due to a heavy fog. The dead were
two trainmen, a man named Free
man of Meridian, and Robinson of
Jackson. Both were stealing a ride
and were on an oil car just ahead
of the caboose or on the front plat
form of the caboose. Both bodies
were badly mangled.
The regular freight in charge of
Conductor Potter left Bogalusa at
3"40 and had just finished taking
water at North Slidell and starting
on the trip when the accident oc-.
curred. The extra engine, was
being sent to do service on the ;I

considered miraculous that they
escaped without being bruised or ,
injured,
