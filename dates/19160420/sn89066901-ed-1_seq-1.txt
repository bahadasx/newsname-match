NUMBER 9
A "CLEAN-UP WEEK"
Monday and Tuesday, May
1 and 2, Are the Dates
for This Event
tKtffiS?
We, the citizens of Mansfield,
the Gem City of the Ozarks, have
a city of which we have reason to
feel proud. We have a climate in
which vegetation, flowers and
shrubbery thrive visible evi
dence of which may be seen in
every lawn and garden of the
city. We have all the natural
advantages required to make this
city one of the beauty spots of
the great state of Missouri.
While we have the ground work
for a city beautiful, and have im
proved it with miles of cement
walks and much park work, to
maintain this desirable standard
it is necessary that at least once
a year the city should be given a
thorough house cleaning. The
thrifty housewife would never
think of permitting her house to
go more than an entire year with
out a thorough cleaning from cel
lar to garret, and a thrifty citi
zenship should exercise the same
degree of pride in the cleanliness
and appearance of the city.
Now, therefore, I, P. H. Riley,
mayor of the city of Mansfield,
in order to encourage and pro
mote a better observance of such
worthy efforts, do hereby desig
nate and set aside Monday and
Tuesday, May 1 and 2, as clean
up days, and do nree all citizens
to make all possible effort toward
the removal of the winter's ac
cumulation of debris and filth,
cleansing and renovating all pre
mises, streets and alleys of rub
bish, and opening and keeping
open all blocked sidewalks and
streets. Let us put on a spring
coat of "clean up." Death to un
sanitary conditions, and beauty
to each citizen's property and at-
attractiveness to our little city.
Also swat the big early fly and
save the health of the community.
Will you fellow citizens do your
part? All rubbish placed in box
es and barrels will be hauled a
way free of charge. Let us not
only make Mansfield clean, but
beautiful as well; the result will
be a healthier, happier and more
attractive city in which to live.
Scoutmaster W. H. Fullington
has tendered the services of the
Boy Scouts, who will act under
the direction of their leader, and
patrol the city, which will be di
vided into sections. If, on their
tnnr of insDection.they find those
who are a little slow or are not
rlRHninsr ur at all, it will be their
duty to rap at the door, and, in a
nice, polite way, ask that the
premises be cleaned up, so that
all brush and trash may be nam
ed away at the same time.
Monday and Tuesday, May 1
and 2, are clean-up dates. Do
not delay, but have your rubbish
ready. F. H. RILEY, Mayor.

The Editor, Mansfield Mirror,
Mansfield, Mo.
Dear Sir:
I am in receipt of a copy of the
Mansfield Mirror and as an early
one-time resident of your coun
try would be glad to offer a few
words of encouragement to your
Young Men's Highway Associa
tien that I have noticed in the
Scientific American.
Next to the father and mother
of us all, the deepest and grand
est of human emotions i the
love of the land that gave us
birth, it is an enlargement, an
exaltation, of all the tenderest
and strongest sympathies of
kindred and of home and in all
the years that have passed the
whole of my thoughts have been
of the day when circumstances
will permit me to visit it, and it
will surely give me great pleas
ure to shake hands with a young
enterprising, country loving
group of citizens such as I see
in this article in the Scientific
American.
The word American sounds
good to me, as I have traveled a-
round a good deal, like some who
let their arrangements get the
better of them, thinking that
things are better just beyond, all
of which is a bad mistake.
We free Americans have the
cream of all the worlds. lair
lands, I am proud to believe and
state, and especially I remember
in the vicinity of Manstield. Most
all of my relatives are there, and
my advice to them has always
been to hold on to the good old
home, until I have at least found
some place better.and I am com
pelled to say that I have not
found it vet.
In closing these lines I beg the
Young,?Ien's Good Roads Club
of Mansfield to accept my thanks
for remaining quiet and content
ed to look after the country's
welfare and the upbuilding of
Mansfield, which looks better to
me than A laska's gold with its
long, frozen winter, or all of Eu
rope with its wars.
I shall pay you a visit in the
near future and hope to find each
and every smiling face that I see
in the American as deeply inter
ested as at the present time, and
also ask you to accept my best
regards and fullest wishes for
good health, success and pros
perity. Such being I remain.
Fraternally yours,
W. H. GARNER.

1 date for Governor of Missouri
The Republicans of Missouri
are most fortunate in having a
citizen of the character and qual
ifications of Hon. Thus. J. Mins,
of St. Louis, to be voted on at the
August primaries. The an
nouncement of his candidacy for
U. S Senator appears in this is
sue of the Mirror.
Mr. Akins was born in Cedar
county, Missouri, and lived all of
his life in Southwest Missouri
until he moved to St. Louis eigh
teen years ago. He engaged in
the mercantile and banking bu
siness at Hutnansville, and was
President of one of the banks in
that town. In 1698 he was elec
ted Chairman of the Republican
State Committee and moved to
St. Louis. He never closed the
State headquarters until the Re
publicans carried the state.
In iSG-i Svac cicicu a mem
ber of the Republican National
Committee. His his ideals of
political work attracted the at
tention of the national leaders
throughout the country. He was
appointed Assistant Treasurer of
the United States by President
Roosevelt, and four years later
reappointed, and served in this
position over five years, and was
then appointed Postmaster of the
city of St. Louis by President
Taft. He was known while Post
master of St. Louis, as one of the
most efficient and courteous ofli
cails in the entire country. The
employes in that office speak of
him today with affection.
Mr. Akins is a man of the poo
pie and has displayed exceptional
ability in the various important
positions which he has held. Dur
ing his entire public life he has
stood for the highest ideals in
the public service. He is clean,
capable and honest He enjoys
a national acquaintance which
would enable him to cuter at once
upon the active duties of the
Senate in the event of his elec
tion.
Mr. Akins is a decided protec
tionist, but does not favor tariff
duties high enough to afford a
shelter to monopoly, or low
euough to invite ruinous compe
tition. Ho believes that conser
vativo protection will build up
American industries, and make
possible the employment of A-
merican labor at remunerative
wages. He has always favored
the policy of building up ou r owu
country, and has often staled
that American markets legiti
mately belong to the American
producer, lie has never in his
campaigns to array class against
class.hcnce both organized labor,
which he has always favored, and
the American producer lias til
ways found a friend in Mr. Akins.
His nomination and election to
the United States Senate would
be a great triumph for clean and
upright methods in political life.
Mr. Akins is highly spoken of
by the Republican press of the
state. For many years he has
been leader in the Republican
party in Missouri, and received
the nomination by his party for
U. S. Senator in 1914. A native
of the Ozarks.ho has many warm

any one was found not worthy

time to criticise the teacher or
quit school but not before.
The following is a list of the

Friday evening and the salary of
each: Superintendent B. A.

a third class high school. Many
patrons want another year added

standard and also for making it
