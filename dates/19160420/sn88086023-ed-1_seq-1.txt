to the American demand to ceaae its
submarine warfare. The opinion here
today was that a diplomatic break
was certain and war a strong possi
bility. This view la based on the fact
that Germany has emphasized that tho
submarine Is the most effective wea
pon against England.
It was believed that the kaiser can
not afford to concede anything essen
tial, though he may orter concessions,
hoping to delay events. The British
attitude ranges from quiet satisfac
tion to Jublllatton. It was believed
that the note was likely to Influence
other neutrals.
The Chronicle said editorially:
"Diplomatic relations will be broken.
The resulting situation will not be a
slate of war. but may easily develop
Into war."
The Pall Mall Gaxette said: "Tho
noted significance lies in the fuel that
Wilson will be unable longer to with
hold cognisance of the true churacter
of the German policy. America is to
be congratulated on the fact that It
has reached the point where it wll.
not be compelled to wear the full liv
ery of official neutrality "
The Manchester Guardian said: "We
do not exult over the prospect of Am
erica's entrance Into the war but do
exult over the prospect of a victorj
lor the Ideals of law and humanity.
Whether Germany yields or not, vic
tory is sensibly nearer."
The Globe declared that the United
States will be more useful now than
If It entered the war. The Westmin

MATTER OF RELOCATING HIGH

JOINT MEETING.
Steps looking to the Immediate im

or the relocation of the road were de.
termined upon yesterday by the coun
ty courts of Umatilla and Morrow
county at a Joint meeting with cltl
zens of the two counties at the boun
dary line near Vinson yesterday.
To secure the improvement of this
road was the primary purpose of the
meeting. The road through Hog Hol
low, part of which Is In Umatilla and
part in Morrow, Is the worst part ol
the Intercounty road. The matter ot
relocating the road so that It would
leave Butter creek at the first can
yon north of Hog Hollow was discuss
ed and those present went on record
as favoring a survey and estimate of
the cost of such a change. The new
road would pass through the i'nt Do
herty land lor a distance of three
miles and Mr. Doherty stated that ho
would expect market value for the
right of way and compensation for the
change of fences.
Both courts stated that they had lit
tle money at this time to spend but,
at the suggestions or the others, held
a separate meeting and decided to
make the survey and estimate at once
and to make necessary Improvements
to the most feasible route.

WASHINGTON, April 10. German
Ambassador Bernstorff today discuss
ed with Secretary of State Lansing
possibility of averting a diplomatic
break between Germany and Ameri
ca. He obtained Lansing's views of
the steps necessary to make Ger
many's submarine warfare conform
to America's Idea of law and human
ity. Bernstorff declined to comment on
the conference It was understood
he does not take a hopeless view of
the situation. It is known he gave
Lansing reason to believe that an
other disaster similar to the Sussex
will not occur while the present ne
gotiations are being conducted. Ha
pointed out that since America has
asked for a distinct cnange in the sub
marine policy, numerous conferences
between Berlin officials must result.
Marines were sent to guard the
wireless stations at Tuckerton and
Sayville. Secretary Daniels said he
would not seixe the stations. Ne
steps have been taken to watch in
terned German vessels.
The inclusion of the word "alto
gether" in the president's threat ot
: a severance of relations with German?
was merely for emphasis. Lansing
J said. He would nbt Indicate to what
e.Tte.nt that severance mlvhl wn Tt .
recalling of Gerard would accomplish
the break. Probably Bernstorff
would be handed his passports, but
this Is unessential. Circumstances
will govern the situation, Lansing
said.
The administration's earnestness
obviously impressed Berflstorff. He
fully reported the situation to Von
Jagow.
The state department reiterated the
contention that Germany must with
draw its submarines and confine Its
attacks to warships pending the re
sult of the American note.
Senator Kern called at the White
House early today and said that con
gress was not disposed to discuss the
situation: thus leaving the president
unembarrassed.
Replying to criticisms like Gores,
who said that the president was risk
ing a war because a few rash Ameri
cans insisted upon traveling oa
armed ships, the White House point
ed out that the controversy has shift
ed entirely from the armed mer
chantmen angle as a result of the
Sussex Incident. The Sussex was un
armed and was not a merchantman.
Among the Americans aboard were
newspapermen, a government courier
and embassy attaches, the very nature
of whose work necessitates their
presence aboard under a belligerent
flag, since it was Impossible now to
reach France on a neutral vessel.
