work "at a moment's notice" in the
event of war.
Appreciating the fact that the

We learn that Mrs. W. Hafner of
near Worcester has been quite sick.
II. Hassan, native of Amassar, near
Beyrouth, Lebanon, in Syria, gave a
talk before the class in Sunday School
at the Presbyterian church that con
tained an interesting sketch of Mt.
Lebanon, and an account of old-time
customs of the people of the ancient
Biblical countries. The picture he
showed the class showed his native
town nestled at the foot of the great
Mt. Lebanon, famed for the fine ce
dars that went toward the building of
the temple at Jerusalem. Talks from
people so familiar with the historic
lands are rare and, I am sure, highly
appreciated.

WOOD CRAFT STORY
FOR
Third Story.
ftld Brother Rabbit is the finest fellow, he is
I J Jso good and kind around the house. If there
were any wood to carry or water to bring from
the spring, he would do it with a smile, just ,like
a good boy does when he wants to help mother.
But, you see, Brother and Sister Rabbit don't
have to carry water, for he always remains with
the children while she goes to get a drink and
when she returns then Brother Rabbit goes for
a drink. Neither do they have to build a fire
for Mother Nature has given them the nicest,
warmest fur overcoat, and it is always thick enough
for Sister Rabbit to pull a few handfuls out to line
the nest, and she doesn't miss it. She has also
given them warm fur boots and they love to run
about right after it has snowed, before anyone
has been out except the field mouse who always
leaves the print of his tail in the snow. Brother
Rabbit loves to make .tracks and little paths that
the boys are so fond of following- Brother Rabbit
is very sharp, too, for he always puts his hind
feet in front when he travels and sticks his front
feet back between his hind legs, to make his tracks
look like he is coming, when, really and truly, he
is just going. He is such a happy little fellow.
He would love to get acquainted with the boys, but
he has seen them shoot the young robins with
their yellow spotted breast, which, if they would
let them live, would become a beautiful red breast
before long.
The other day as Brother Rabbit passed the Coon
tree he heard something like this, "It's my time
to hide, you always want the best of everything.''
It sounded very much like the Coon children. The
Possum children replied, "We will take our acorn
marbles and go home." About that time hot words
were exchanged between Brother Coon and Broth
er Possum. The result was, Brother Terrapin
suggested . they, settlt, tjie. question with a fight.
This. jus suited the Coon who. is always ready'
for a scrap, but the little Red Squirrel said, "Shame
on you, Brother Terrapin, I thought you were
a friend of Brother Possum." But Brother Terra
pin just winked and whispered something to Red
Squirrel. The result was Brother Terrapin was
to make all the arrangements and at the appointed
time he led the bragging Coon and the shrinking
Possum to the battle ground. The little folk
of the forest arrayed themselves on fallen logs
to witness the battle. The funniest thing of all
was, they were going to fight it out in a hollow
log just large enough for them to crawl in.
Red Squirrel dropped a hickory'nut as a signal and
in they went- For awhile not a sound could be
heard, but after a little bit the voice of Brother
Coon was heard to say, "Let go of my ear. Ouch,
you are choking me. You know I can't fight unless
I am on my back ; I believe this is a put up job."
Brother Brown Bear took the log in his arms
and shook them both to the ground and the fight
ended with Brother Coon beating a hasty retreat.
Brother) Rabbit who was walking home with
Brother Muskrat remarked, "It doesn't always
pay to take up children's quarrels." To which the
Muskrat replied, "That's so, Brother Rabbit,
that's so."

FORMER MEXICO
GIRL A WINNER
Miss Annette Smith won the debate
in the high school contest last Friday
night on the subject, Resolved, That
Missouri should adopt the system of
rural credits advocated by the Gard
ner Land Bank Bill. Miss Smith de
fended the negative side and the
points she made would have sent cold
chills down the back of Fred D.
Gardner had he heard her denounce
his bill and point out more reasons
against it than Cornelius Roach pos
sesses. Virgil Buzbee upheld the
bill.
Miss Smith will represent the high
school at the General Missouri Teach
ers' Association in Warrensburg next
week. She does not know which side
of the question she will have to de
bate in the State meet says the
Boonville (Mo.) Central-Republican.
Miss Smith is the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. A. B. Smith, formerly of
Mexico, and is the granddaughter of
Mrs. Anna Smith here.
There were nine boys in the de
bate and Miss Smith was the only girl
contestant. She is a successful de
bater. She won second in the debate
at Warrensburg, speaking on the af
firmative side of the question men
tioned above. She is a product of
the Mexico schools, getting her first
inspirations for school work here,
and the Mexico girls and boys never
fail to gather distinction for them
selves. L. R. Fe rris, president of the
Commercial Club, has appointed Col.
Fred Morris, Nate Phillip and C. P.
Malone as a committee on trade ex
tension for Mexico.
