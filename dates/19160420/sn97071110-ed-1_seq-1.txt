"GOOD THINGS VO EAT'
DEE ORCHARD
DISTRICT GROWS
ORE. LUMBER CO. HELPS PROGRESS
Fruit Trees and Berries Take Place of
Monsters of Virgin Forests
Railway Extends Lakeward
Ten sears ago the town of Dee earns
into existence as the terminus of the
Mount Hood Railway Co. and the loca
tion of the Oregon Lumber Co. Just
north of the confluence of the East and
Middle Forks of the Hood river, its
structures reared in a level area at the
bottom of the gorge of the combined
streams. Dee has been characterized
since its birth by the bustle and bustle
of a big lumber mill. In the earlier
days the logging camps were within a
short distance of the bumming saws.
But each succeeding year the timber
from a larger area has been consumed.
The huge firs of the Dee flat cotantry,
a level plateau of fertile land lying be
tween the West and Middle Forks of
Hood river and just west of the town
of Dee, were manufactured into lum
ber, and gradually the. deep, red shot
soil has been planted with apple and
pear trees, successors to the virgin
gisnts of the forest, and strawberries
grow in an ever increasing acreage be
tween the tree rows. This red shot soil
is peculiarly adapted to all kind of
fruits, and especially do strawberries
thrive on it For the past several sea
sons Dee growera have been marketing
berries in carload lots, in the near fu
ture the district will probably be the
largest berry producing section of the
Hood Kiver valley, for growers there
have planned to set out this spring
400,000 new plants, 12,000 plants to the
acre.
And so today Dee is not known
merely for its lumbering industry, but
for the suirounding agricultural dis
trict. The development of the Dee flat
country was fostered by the Oregon
Lumber Co., which in 1908 organised
the Dee Power & Irrigation Co. Two
thousand inches of water in the West
Fork of Hood river, just above the con
fluence of that stream and the Lake
Branch was filed on and a main canal
less than five miles in length was con
structed. Purchasers of land are
charged $40 pei acre for a perpetual
water right, the maintenance of the
ditch is not difficult, and the cost of
upkeep merely nominal. With the ex
ception of the uount riood water Vo.,
which waters a stretch of land in the
Upper Valley, the system furnishes the
cheapest irrigation service in the Hood
Kiver valley.
About 20 of the employes or the lum
ber company are owners of orchard
tracts that are being rapidly developed
and brought into bearing in the Dee
flat aection. Investments there, too,
have attracted the general public, and
some of the best cared for ana most
productive acres of the Hood River dis
trict may be seen by the numerous
pleasure seekers, fishermen and outing
parties that traverse the community
annually bound for the headwaters of
the Hood river branches and the Lost
Lake country. A pear orchard belong
ing to the estate of tne late "Uasn"
Jones, of Portland, is located here, and
is pointed out as a model Hood River
orchard tract.
As in other Hood River districts, the
residents of the Dee flat are cosmopoli
tan, i J. R. Edgar, a former business
man of Manila, P. I., purchased a 10
acre tact there last year. Last week
Mr. Edgar purchased 15 acres of near
by property. C. B. Compton, a Manila
newspaper man, owns a place here.
He has retired from ms profession in
the Orient and is due here this week
to become actively engaged as as an
orchardist. A number of Japanese own
tracts on the Dee flat.
A native Filipino boy came here laet
summer to make bis home with Mr.
Edgar. The winter weather, however,
proved too severe for the lad used to
the tropical Fourth of July weather the
year round, and after the first few
heavy frosts the brown boy left for
Portland to seek employment indoors
druing the winter months. Mr. Edgar
will be joined next spring by bis wile
and two little daughters.
Except when weather conditions pre
vented and a period of inactivity caused
by a fire in 1913, when tne big plant
was destroyed, the uregon Lum
ber Company's big mill at Dee, has
been in continuous operation. Follow
ing the fire the plant was replaced as
rapidly as possible. The new mill cuts
between 125,000 and 150.000 feet daily,
operating 10 hours. The mill and the
lumber camps employ aooui aw men.
The town of Dee, however, is no lon
ger the terminus of the line of the
Mount Mood Kaiiway co., tor tne
tracks in 1910 were extended to Park-
dale in the Upper Hood River valley,
and a daily train service is maintained
between Hood River and this point
During the berry harvest season, iced
refrigerator cars are hauled to Park-
dale and Dee for the accommodation
of the growers.
' ;A six mile line of railway has been
extended to the West Fork of Hood
river, tapping the rich tracts of timber
there. The company'! logging camps
are now located on the West Fork.
This West Fork line will be gradually
pushed further to the southwestern
part of the county until eventually it
will end at the shores of Lost Lake,
one of the most scenic spots of Hood
River county, and it may be safely pre
dicted that the time is not far in the
future when tourists' hotel will be
erected on the banks of the crystal
clear body of water, which in the sum
mer months mirrors the glistening peak
of Mount Hood. The fishing in the
district is unsurpassed, and even today.
with the journey to toe lake caning for
the most strenuous endeavors, many
men and women journey there annually.
Much of the heavy timber land ex
tending to the very shores of Lost
Lake are owned by the Oregon Lumber
Co.. The management of the company.
however, declares that the magnificent
virgin forest at thia point, firs, cedars
and spruce, will never be despoiled. A
bill haa been prepared for introduction
into congress that provides for the ex
change of timber lands further to the
east of the lake, thus the shores of the
beautiful body of wster will pass again
to the government. A chain of wooded
government land, too, will be preserved
along the line of the proposed road into
the lake from the ends of county roads
already penetatlng the scenic district.
and the whole will form a part of the
proposed Mount Hood boulevard park
Dee received its name from the late
Judge Thomas D. Dee, of Ugden, Utah,
who was formerly a member of the
board of director! of the lumber com
pany.
Cbaa. T. Early, now general mana
ger and treasurer of the Oregon Lum

deal of his time at the Dee office! of

SPANISH CLASS
IS ENTERTAINED
The night class, devoted to the study
of the'Spanish language, spent a most
delightful evening Monday at the home
of Mr. and Mrs. George Stranahan on
Cascade avenue, where the entire class
was entertained moat enjoyably by
Mr. and Mrs. Stranahan,. Mr. and Mrs.
W. A. Schaffner and Mr. and Mrs. W.
H. McClain.
Early in the evening a troupe of wan
dering minstrels appeared at the door
and after fearless entreaties and solici
tude by the member! present consented
to entertain the party by the rendition
. 1 . m . .1 .
oi several selections irom some ox ine
well known operas.
After the refreshments had been
served Senor McClain gave a talk in
the Spanish language, which proved he
was a past master of this vernacular,
and in which he thanked Miss Mabel
Case for her untiring efforts in behalf
of the class, for her efficient and dili
gent tutelage with the membera of the
class, and presented her with a hand
some lsvilliere as a token of their ap
preciation. Thia was only one of the several en
joyable social evenings spent by the
class during its school leason. Two
weeks ago the class was entertained at
a Mexican dinner at the home of Mr.
and Mrs. C. D. Hoyt on the East Side,
who have spent a number of years in
Mexico. The entertainment and dinner
was served in true Mexican style. All
table appointments, including Mexican
linens, and potteries, were of the gen
uine Mexican type. Mora recently, Mr.
and Mrs. F. E. Skinner, of Portland
Way, gave the class a most delightful
entertainment at the country home.
The Spanish class began its course
about five months ago, holding a class
session twice a week, with an enroll
ment of sixteen members. The class
has made a very marked progress under
the efficient instructions and super
vision of Miss Case, and it is the earn
est desire of all members of the class
that the studies will be resumed after
the summer's vacation, with Miss Case
in charge.
WALL COMPLETE;
TO CLEAN RESERVOIRS
Under the supervision of City Engin
eer Price, a crew of men has completed
the construction of a 140 foot concrete
retaining wall, built to protect the east
abutment of the steel bridge. The cost
of the wall, of the cantilever type and
28 feet high at the highest point, will
reach $2,000.' The concrete masonry is
reinforced with iron rods. About 500
cubic yards of earth will be needed to
fill in the broadened roadway behind
the new wall. The fill will not be
made, however, for 30 days, or until
after the wall has thoroughly dried.
When local people, observing "Clean
up Week," as proclaimed by the Ore
gon Federation of Women'a Clubs, are
making Hood River a spotless town
next week, the municipal water depart
ment will participate in the event, and
the two big reservoirs of the water
system will be thoroughly scoured and
scrubbed.

WINTER DAMAGE
IS VERY LIGHT
COLUMBIA HIGHWAY IS PASSABLE
Party Makes Inspection It is Thought
Traffic Should Be Prohibited
For a Tune
Tbe damage along the 22 miles of
Columbia river highway in Hood River
county from the severe weather the
past winter baa been far alighter than
any one anticipated. And a journey
Friday over the route brought a grati
fying surprise to the motorist ; for the
scenic route is already passable from
this city to Cascade Locks, and the
journey for tbe most of the way can be
made in dispatch and with the greatest
comfort. Road supervisors of districts
No. 1 and No. 2. resnectivelv. W. D.
Trotter and S. W. Curran. who have
been busy tbe past three weeks, have
already removed all traces of slides
with the exception of two or three
points between Cascade Locks and the
Multnomah county line. Were it not
for several very wet spots between the .
Multnomah county line and Cascade
Locks automobiles could easily oegoti- '
ate the distance between Hood River
and tbe former point.
Despite a steady downpour of rain
the following Hood River men made a
thorough Inspection of the entire lensth '
of the highway Friday: E. O. Blanch-
ar, E. W. Birge, R. E. Soott, Ted Serr
and Joe D. Thomison, proceeding from
here to a point about a mile and a half '
west of Cascade Locks in Mr. Serr s '
lutomobile. The journey waa made in
order that the men might from first -hand
information make recommenda
tions to the county eourt for improve
ments to be made for the spring
and summer automobile traffic. While
few days' work devoted to the ex
treme west end of Hood River's lap of ,
the highway will make it passable, it
was the consensus of opinion of the in
spection party that traffic should be
promoited until alter the rainy season
is over, or at least until May 1. To put
the highway in the best of condition
for the heavy traffic of the coming mo
tor season, the earth surface should be
dragged and given a crown. If traffic
allowed over the highway immedi
ately following such work, and while it
still wet. the roadbed will be cut
full of deep ruts.
it will be recommended by the report
of tbe inspection party that a sand or
gravel surfacing be applied to points
of the highway now covered with aharp
edged stone, that a turnout be made
on Ruthton hill, the heavy grade just
west of the city, and a turnout on a
narrow stretch of rosd just west of the
Kuthton planer of the atanley-Smith
Lumber Co.
Taken as a whole the Hood River
portion of the Columbia river highway
s in far better condition at the present
time than during the late summer and
fall months of last year. The men who
made up Friday's party spoke in com
mendation of Supervisor Curran, who
has made the most of his road appro
priations. The route bas been cleared
of bushes, thus eliminating danger at
sharp curves, and the surface has been
smoothedout.
fAt the present time Warren Miller,
supervisor of road district No. 3, which
les just west of the city, is engaged
with a crew of men in removing loose
rock and smoothing over rough sur
faces. The Mitchells Point tunnel.
wbich lies in Mr. Miller's district, ia
far better condition than reputed.
Last year a clay and gravel surfacing
was placed over the jagged rock grade
as left by contractors who built the
tunnel, and these have been cemented
with the rocks, forming a hard and
fairly smooth roadbed.
Even though tbe east end of the
Multnomah portion of the highway were
not closed by order of the commission
ers of that county, it would remain im
passable to any automobile. At a dis
tance of 15 feet from the Hood River
county line a slide the past winter de
posited a huge mass of earth and stone
in the center of which four maple
trees, from 12 to 15 inches in diameter,
rrar themselves, just as though they
were originally planted in the center
of the road.
No better day than last Friday could
have been picked for a trip of inspec
tion over tbe highwsy. With the sur
face fairly wet by the ateady rain no
defect was overlooked. Despite the
rain the men making the trip enjoyed
it. Some of the incidents of tbe day
were interesting. Mr. Serr drove hia
Overland car, and it may be remarked
that Mr. Serr ia a mighty good driver.
Yet the best of drivers make errors.
Mr. Serr made the error last Friday of
thinking hia chains were in the car
when they were elsewhere. The error
was discovered just west of Wyeth,
where a long, steep hill, mnddy and full
of deep ruts, loomed ahead. About two
thirds of the wsy up Mr. serr s noa
skids began to spin, every depression
in tbe.tires was filled with greasy mud.
Then everybody gave of his advice and
best efforts, out still the car stuck.
Mr. Blanchar started back to Wyeth,
but forunately met Mr. aod Mrs. Chas.
Gray, whose place was about a half
mile to the west. Mr. Banchar accom
panied them to their home, and when
be agan appeared to his fellow motor
ist! he looked aa though be were going
to a hanging. A 30-foot coil of . log
chain was over the kink of one arm,
while on the opposite shoulder was
about an equal length of rope. The
rope was placed on one rear wheel and
tbe chain on tbe other. Then the auto
mobile acted beautifully.
Tbe road on the gentle alope of thia
bill last year was covered with cinders,
and formed one of the beat stretches
on the highway. During the past win
ter Gray 'a creek near the top of the
grade, broke over its banks and ran
directly down tbe middle of the road.
From the place of Mr. bray the high
way extends to Cascade Locks through
heavy forests for the most part. At
intervale may be seen the homestead
places of the few settlers of the dis
trict It ia a beautiful drive, one that
must be appealing during the months
of extreme warm summer weather.
One cannot think of it ever getting
excessively hot in those nooks of deep
shadows. At this seasotuof the year
myriads of spring flowers are blooming,
tbe mock orange or syringa, the wild
currant, blue bells and dog-tooth vio
lets. Soon the woods will be filled with
the great silvery white blossoms of tbe
dogwood.
