DEATH GF MOTHER
GAUS JUDGE HWflV
VENERABLE MOTHER OF
JUDGE CARROLL CALL
ED BY DEATH.
PASSED AWAY AT
STARKVILLE HOME
Hon. J. I. Sturdivant U Presid
ing Over Court in Judge
Carroll' Place.
Hon. T. B. Carroll, judge of; the
sixteenth circuit court district, who
came here Monday morning to pre
side over the spring term of that
tribunal, was called to his home in
Starkville yesterday ,by a telegram
announcing the death of his vener
able mother. Hon. J. I. Sturdivant is
presiding over the local court terrn
v and will continue in that position
until Judge Carroll returns ' which
will probably be the first of next
week. '
The court was organized Monday
morning, both Judge Carroll and
Hon. Guy Rencher, ofDeKalb, who
was recently elected to succeed Hon.
Ames Saunders, as district attorney,
having been present. There being
no local county attorney, Mr. Ren
cher had conferred with Circuit
Clerk Stephenson and Deputy Clerk
, Handle and had a large number of
witnesses ready to be examined as
soon as the cases in which they are
to appear are ready for trial.
Court had been organized and the
work of the-term was well under
way when Judge Carroll received
the telegram announcing the death
of hii mother.
The first work to be taken up was
the organization of the grand jury,
Hon. B. A. Weaver having been se
lected as its foreman, after which
Judge Carroll proceeded to deliver

had their attention specially direct
ed to gambling, liquor selling and
other minor violations of the law.
Judge Carroll said that the number
of liquor cases appealed from the
municipal court indicated that this
here and urged the grand jurors to
indict operators of blind tigers
wherever the evidence before them
warranted such action.
After Judge Carroll had included
his charge to the grand jury court
adjourned in order that Hon. Guy
Mitchell and Hon. J. E. Rankin of
Tupelo, and Hon. J. A. Cunningham
of Booneville, all of whom are can
didates for Congress from the First
district, might be afforded an op
portunity to address their Lowndes
county constituents. Each gentle
man was introduced by Hon. J. I.
Sturdivant, a prominent member of
the local bar, and each spoke about
forty minutes. The candidates cog
ently defined their platforms and
presented their claims in a forceful
manner.
One of the most important cases
disposed of is that of J. A.
Stricklarfd, who sought to obtain
damages in the sum of $5,000 from
the Credit Division of the Chamber
of Commerce for alleged injury to
his character by having sent him,
through C. B. Lovell, a local mer
chant, a letter regarding the pay
ment of an account. The case was
thrown out of court on a demurrer
filed by Mr. E. E. Callaway of the
firm of CallaVvay and Storey and
Mr. M. E. White, who represented
the defendant. This demurrer set up
a lack of proper parties, sued asso
ciation and not members of the or
ganizationjf no statement showing
libel; did not allege falsity of state
ment; did not state that any person
saw the records or that anyone was
influenced by them; did not show
that there was blacklist with plain
tiffs name thereon; did not show
srrounds for damaees. On these
grounds Judge Carroll sustained
motion, which was demurred to by
Mr. R. M. Holmes, who represented
Mr. Strickland. While Judge Carroll
sr stained the demurrer he may give
Mr. Holmes permission to amend
his Original declaration, thus bring
ing the case back into court.
Jack Worthy, a negro, who was
convicted on the charge of retail
ing in the municipal court several
months ago and who appealed his
case, had a hearing yesterday. He
was represented by Senator W
Stribling, who made a forceful ar
gument in his behalf and succeeded
. in securing his acquittal.
Following is the personnel of the
grand jary: Messrs. B. A. Weaver,
foreman, C. W. Jernigan, W. F. Mc
Clary, J. M. Lumpkin, J. E. G ilium,
C. L Brown, L. E. Hatchett, M. N.

TO
MAN RUN DOWN BY TRAIN SUN
DAY DIED AT SANITARIUM
SUNDAY NIGHT.
Peter Powers, a blacksmith, liv
ing at Staford, Ala., who was run
down by a train on the Montgomery
division of the Mobile and Ohio last
Sunday and who was later brought
to the McKinley Sanitarium for
treatment, died about tl o'clock
uries.
Mr. Powers had visited Columbus
Sunday, and it is said that while here
he became intoxicated. He took a
train, presumably with the intention
f going to his home in Stafford,
but got off at McCrary, and sat
down on the track, where he went to
sleep. Some time later an east
ound freight train came along and
knocked him from his position, his
skull having been fractured by the
blow. He was rushed to this city and
received every possible attention,
but the wound was so serious that
the efforts to save his life proved
futile.
Deceased was about 45 years old
and is survived by his wife and sev
eral children. He formerly worked
for Mr. H. C. Foreman, who for a
number of years conducted a black
smith shop on Bell avenue, and was
well known in this city, where he
had a number of friends who sin
cerely sympathize with the family
n the profound grief which his un
timely grief entails.

HONOR OF VISITORS.
ADDRESS BY MR.
STONE A FEATURE
Meridian Class Dines at In
dustrial Institute & College
as Guests of Students.
Nearly four hundred Baracas
from Meridian came here fin a spe
ial train Sunday to visit the Baraca
class of the First . Baptist church,
and were elaborately entertained,
the program having included a
joint meeting of the two classes at
the church and a visit to the Indus
trial Institute and College, where
the visitors took dinner as guests of
the students of the institution. The
auditorium of the First Baptist
church is one of the most commo
dious in the city and was crowded to
full capacity by the assemblage that
gathered there to witness the joint
capacity by the assemblage which
gathered there to witness the joint
meeting of the two classes, it being
estimated that there were between
two thousand and twenty-five hun
dred people present.
The visitors arrived over the Mo
bile and Ohio roalroad at 10 o'clock
Sunday morning, and were met at
the depot by a reception, embrac
ing not only every member
of the local class, but a num
ber of private citizens. A procession
was formed and the body marched
to the First Baptist church, where
the joint meeting of the two classes
took place.
The program at the church was
inaugurated by a selection by the
augmented orchestra, after which
an address of .'weWme was delivered
local class, this address having been
responded to by Hon. A. S. Boze-
man, of Meridian. Both gentlemen
made impressive talks and both were
attentively listened to. The choir
then sang "All Hail the Power of
Jesus' Name," after which God's
blessing upon the assemblage was
invoked by Dr. J. L. Vipperman,
pastor of the church. After a selec
tion by the Meridian quartette, Mr.
W. H. Carter delivered an address
on behalf of the Men's Baraca class
of the First Methodist church, and
this was followed by another selec
tion by the choir, after which Major
B. A. Lincoln introduced Hon.
Hardy Stone, teacher of the Merid
ian class, who selected as his theme,
'The Divinity of Christ," and who
made one of the finest talks ever
heard in Columbus. Mr. Stone is
possessed of unusual forensic abil
ty, and in conception, diction and
delivery his address was a veritable
gem. The singing of the doxology
brought the program to a close.
The visitors went direct from the
church to the Mississippi Industrial
Institute and College, where they
were the dinner guests of the stu
dents of ne institution. Before uin
ner a photograph was made of thi
assemblage, and at four o'clock in

DAUGHTERS OF CONFED
ERACY PREPARE FOR
DECORATION DAY.
WANT CITIZENS
TO PARTICIPATE
Celebration Takes Place April
26, and Will be the Most
Elaborate of Recent Years.
Wednesday, April 2fi, will le
Confederate Decoration Day, and
members of the Stephen D Lee
Chapter, United Daughters of the
Confederacy, under whose auspices
the day will be locally observed, are
preparing for a celebration which
will be fur more eluborate than any
which has marked a similar event
in Columbus during recent years.
The custom of decorating the
graves of Confederate soldiers orig
inated in Columbus, and for a long
time was elaborately observed.
During the time that the lute Gen.
Stephen D. Lee was president of the
A. and M. College the full cadet
battalion of that institution always
icame over to participate in the pro
gram, and their presence gave a
military aspect to the exercises.thus
inciting public interest to a high de
gree. When Uen. I.ee resigned me
presidency of the college, however,
the annual visit of its students was
abandoned, and ever since that time
interest in the event seems to have
been gradually decressing.
The local Confederate Daughters
have determined to make an effort
to revive the old-time interest in
Decoration Day, and with that end
in view earnestly bespeak the aid
and co-operation of the people of
Columbus. They are anxious to
make the coming celebration a suc
cess, and want not only those di
rectly inte-ested but iUxni gen
erally to be present.
An interesting program is being
tjrepured for the occasion, and as
Boon as completed will be published
in The Commercial.
Utility Sale and Lunch.
Today in the Arcade building the
Pastor's Aid, of the First Methodist
church will have a sale of many use
ful articles. The Wesley class will
serve lunch from 11:30 a. m. to 7
o'clock in the evening, and the fol
lowing good things will make up the
