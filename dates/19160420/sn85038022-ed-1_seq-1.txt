PRESIDENT'S ULTIMATUM DEL IV
ERED TO GER3LVXY.
Washington, April 20. President
Wilson's long expected Anal warning
to Germany that the United States will
break off diplomatic relations unless
she-abandons her present methods of
submarine warfare, and immediately
declares her intention to do so, was
delivered yesterday in n noto to Berlin
and was announced by the President in
an address to a joint session of Con
gress. Tho President demands noth
ing less than the abandonment of sub
marine warfare against commerce.
Doth tho President a address and tho
American noto declare In unequlv
ocablo terms that only by Germany
according to tho demand can tho
breaking off of relations altogether be
prevented.
The President considers that the
next step depcndB solely upon Ger
many nnd that throo or four days con
stitute a reasonable tlmo for a reply.
IIo Is willing to discuss how sub-
marina warfare may bo conducted
within tho limits of internatonul law
and humanity after Germany abandons
her present methods.
Diplomatic history records but one
Instance as yet whero a breaking of
relations between two first class pow
ers has not eventually brought war
that which now exists between Ger
many am Italy.
Congress received tho President s
declaration of his courso with mixed
ovldonccs of concern and approbation.
Most of tho leaders, Democratic and
Republican, thought tho President
could hardly do less, and somo ex
pressed the opinion that his action
would not lead to war. Republican
Leader Mann alono of all the opposi
tion openly attacked tho President for
his stand. Ho characterized Its as a
political play.
