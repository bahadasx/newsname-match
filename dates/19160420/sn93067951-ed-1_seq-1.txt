9 The Great War
The most gigantic conflict in
t? history of the world, the
!,: bitle of Verdun, has entered
ft. th\ tenth week. It is in many respr.ts
without precedent The
enAmouo scale of the German j
prorations and execution of t he j

elaborate sysfctn of trenches.
New KecCd in Losses.
^ In no previa- battle were the
losses so high as those which
A have been estitated in the light*
- ing around Veijun. These estimates,
however, cannot be regarded
as conclusive evidence,
for neither Germwiy nor France
has announced in own casualties.
The Frenclwar otliee has
declared the Gerians have lost
200,000 in killed;, wound* d and
captured. The Germans state
6enii-olliciall.v that the French
casualties numberiCO,000 killed
and wounded and tlat 30,000 unwounded
French pfsoners have
been taken. If theta estimates
are approximately correct nearly
400,000 men have bleu eliminate
Li as fighting units
The giouud occupied by the
Germans after 50 days of offensive
operations may he roughly
calculated as 100 squire miles.
They have forced back the
French from their outlying po- j
sitions to the definite line of re-|
sistance along the semi-circular
front from the edge of the Argon
ne eastward ucrosb the Meuee
( , i and southward into the Woevre.
For the most part this main line
has withstood the shock of successive
attucks. The Germans
captured Fort Douaumont early
r id the campaign and have bitten
into French defenses at Dead j
? Man's lull and elsewhere, but at j
I no point have they succeeded in j
I breaking through,
i The drive was begun on Febw
^"diiry 21st by the German army
. * under Crown Prinee Frederick
William. Since that date tcrriffic
battles have ruged almost
iucessently on this front and
though the French have put up
an heroic resistence the Teutonic
progress has seemed inexorable.
If the Germans are willing to
spent sullicient men ami aminu
nition there in not much doubt
but they can take the fortrets.
Military critics differ as to the
value the fortress will he to them
when taken.
The Russians have gained another
important victory in Turkey
by the capture of Trebezoud.

Getting Fixed
Last Sunday night at the
Methodist church the Kev. J. I.
Tyler preached on the subject of
"Making liaste Wisely."
Wlute speaking on the evils ol
& too strenuous race for wealtli
he 8poke of an incident in hit
pastorate a few years ago.
A young f.?rraer in his congregation
was very ambitious and
w&h so absorbed in "gettitg fix
ed, ' as he called it that he neg
lected his family, his religior
and his healHi. "About the
time he got 'fixed' we buried
him," said the preacher.
*"1 had occasion to pass by the
farm later and I saw anothei
man on the veranda, w ho smoked
good cigars and talked about 'mj
horses, my farm, my stock,' etc
This man had matried the wid<
iiw and he was fixed." ]
The moral, of coarse is clear]
Don't kill yourself getting fixc lj

The Interdenominational I)is
trict Sunday School Convention
meets i n Chesterfield at the
Baptist Church next Sunday,
April 28d, at 8 p. m.
This meeting promises to be
very interesting und especially
beneficial to all Sunday school
workers.
The Chesterfield District embraces
Courthouse, Cheraw and
>8 Pee Dee Townships. Hon. W.

y district; L. A. Kerr is county
m president and R. T. Ca6ton and

1' to address the meeting next
Itkinday.
First Meeting of New Council
The new city officers who were
elected on Tuesday and installed
on Weddesday held their first
meeting on Thursday, last; week.
The attitude of this council to
a man see.ns to be, "We did nol
seek the office and therefore owe
no political favors to any man."
They are going at their work
like the proverbial new broom
and purpose to make a clean
sweep before the broom Rets old.
In one respect Chesterfield resembles
the large cities and it
has been suggested that a dele
gation be sent to New jYork to
learn how the police question is
handled there. For the present
it is suflnient to <ay that the
new chief has not yet been selected.
The property of the Cemetery
Association lias been transferred
to the town and all payments
due on this property are to be j
made to the town clerk. The
town will also bo responible for
the up-koep of theceuietery.
The mayor is emphatic in his
declaration that the speed limit
is going to be enforced, lie says j
Main Street has now ceased to!
he a race track and is no longer ;
to be mistaken for one.
