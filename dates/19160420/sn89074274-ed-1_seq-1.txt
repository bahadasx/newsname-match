Bakery Gets Reputation
on Russell-Miller Hour
In a recent issue of a bakers' maga
zine considerable space is devoted to
a Minneapolis bakery that specializes
in Russell-Miller flour. The article
follows:
A company has been organized in
Minneapolis and is building what is
declared to be the only electric bak
ery in the country. That is, the build
ing is to be heated and lighted, the ma
chinery operated and the baking done
by electricity. Three ovens are being
installed, with a maximum capacity of
20,000 loaves daily. The plant is to be
ready for operation in about a month.
All deliveries will be made by electric
trucks.
From the time the flour is placed in
the blending bins, the dough or bread
•will not be touched by hand. Every
thing will be handled by automatic ma
chinery, even to the wrapping of the
bread. Since there will be no fuel,
ashes or smoke around the building,
those promoting the enterprise assert
it will be the most sanitary bakery in
existence.
The company has taken over an old'
established bakery in North Minne
apolis, which it is rebuilding. Ample
room will be provided for future
growth.
The remodeled Olde Tyme Bakerie,
Minneapolis, is everything but what
its name implies. The plant has been
entirely rebuilt and new equipment
installed until it is now a model mod
ern plant.
Untimely Death of Beloved
Mrs. ffm. Beadle at Anaconda
The entire community was greatly
®addened and shocked by the news
that Mrs. Wm. Beadle, known to all as
•Clara Aldahl, had p&Bsed into the long
asleep from which there is no awaken
ing on earth, at her home in Anaconda,
IMontana, where she went as a bride so
"happily a few short months ago.
IFriends here had letters from Her only
a few days ago in which no mention,
-was made of her being ill, and it is
not known that she was especially ill,
nor what was the exact cause of her
death. She had been in frail health
a couple of years ago, and had been a
sufferer from diabetes, but had been
so much improved that no one realized
«ny possibility of danger. But what
ever the cause, she quietly slipped
away from the husband with whom
-such a short time had been passed in
the new home, and the many friends
here and elsewhere are left only with
the memory of one who was qp active
in the social life of the community.
A striking feature is the immense
traveling oven, built and installed by
Joseph Baker & Sons, Ltd., of London.
There is nothing like it in this part of
the country and there are said to be
only three or four of its kind in the
United States. The oven is about 50
feet in depth and weighs 600 tons.
The loaves are fed into the front of
the oven and come out in the rear, in
the shipping room, baked. The oven,
which is basement-fired, has a capacity
of 2,500 loaves an hour. It is now in
operation, and the company has dis
continued using its 11 old ovens on
the upper floors of the building.
A 50-foot proofer, with six chains of
buckets or Swinging shelves, manufac
tured by the Werner & Pfleiderer Co.,
has also been installed. Also two mix
ers, a divider, molder and about a
dozen steen troughs. A large steam
proofroom has been built and the
doughroom fixed up.
The company has provided locker
and bath rooms for its employees and
has built a loading platform, under
roof. Its leading brand now is Occi
dent bread," after the Occident brand
of flour made by the Russell-Miller
Milling Co.

Wisconsin Man Takes
Barnes County Bride
A wedding of interest to many oc
curred in St. Paul Saturday, April 15,
when Rev. Gotheridge spoke the words
that united Miss Lydia McQueen and
Max A. Hasse, the ceremony taking
place at the Evangelical parsonage in
that city. They were accompanied by

Preliminary
Report For
State Board
Fargo, April 15.—Preliminary re
port by the educatiional experts who
are making a survey of the North Da
kota educational institutions, likely be
made to the state board of regents
when that body meets in Bismarck on
April 24.
There is a growing impression that
the board of regents will not make any
radical change in the higher education
al system of the state, but that the
plan to carry out will embrace a cur
tailment of such features that should
be eliminated from the several schools,
which the board may regard as mis
placed—or for which there is no de
mand.
At the April 24 meeting, the board
will consider the budgets for the var
ious institutions for the coming year—
and in view of that fact, it is generally
accepted that the board will have be
fore it a preliminary report by the sur
veyors, which will, in a measure, guide
the regents in their plans.
For some time past, rumors have
been current of big changes that were
contemplated. These, however, seem to
have no foundation in fact—and promi
nent educators and others who are In
touch with the work of the board of
regents, and who are acquainted with
the temperament of the members of
the board—are confident that nothing
radical is to be attempted.
One report had it that the engineer
ing department at the agricultural col
lege was to be moved to the university,
and another that the engineering de
partment at the university was to be
removed to the agriculturel college. In
well informed circles, however, It is
held that the regents will take the

Home Economic Gub
Admits New Members
A delightful social evening was en
joyed Saturday when Mrs. Andrew
Bonhus and Mrs. Carl Weismann were
hostesses to the Home Economics club
and their husbands at the home of Mrs.
Bonhus. The husbands were initiated
into the club as honorary members.
After all were assembled they adjourn
ed to a picnic ground and camp fire
in the attic, where a long table was set,
beautifully decorated with yellow jon
quils, ferns and smilax and dozens of
tiny chickens. A delicious lunch was
served and the remainder of the eve

a late hour the guests returned to their
homes having spent a pleasant eve

Sixty-five years ago today, April 17,
1851, occurred the marriage of Chas.
Hollinshead, Sr., to Miss Maria Mal

head was born at Dryden, N. Y., April
26, 1831. Mr. Hollinshead was born at
Lansing, N. Y., July 10, 1826. After
their marriage they resided on a farm
near Delavan for ten years. They
then removed to Pawnee City, Neb.,
where Mr. Hollinshead entered in the
mercantile business for' five years.
Later they moved to Fargo, where he
dealt in horses. He is widely known
as a horseman and has been called
upon to judge horses at many fairs. In
1880 they moved to Valley City, where
they now live. There were only 17
buildings here at that time and in the
long years that have passed since then,

They have one son, Albert, who re

Peculiar Accident
Kills Tolley Man
Tolley, N. D., April 15—Alfred Ben
son, a young man of this city, died last
night as the result of one of the most
peculiar accidents probably in history.
He was employed in unloading trac
tors from a flat car onto the unload
ing platform yesterday. After the
tractor which he was unloading got
onto the platform he was unable from
some cause to stop the engine, and the
front wheels dropped. When this oc
curred, the tractor turned a somer
sault in the air. Benson was thrown
upward and came down on the tractor
again fracturing his skull by striking
on the overturned machine.
He lived about six hours after the
accident.
A Good Bank to Do Business With
Mr. and Mrs. Chas. Hollinshead
Celebrate Notable Anniversary
I
Petty, of Spokane, Wash., Chas. Hol
linshead, Jr., and Stroud Hollinshead,
both living in Valley City. Miss Sarah
Malloy, a sister of Mrs. Hollinshead,
and one year her senior, has made her
home with them for a great many
years, and both these ladies are loved
by their many friends. Mrs. Hollins
head has been a member of the W. C.
T. U. for 26 years. She was one of the
first members of the organization in
the city and is now a life member.
Honesty has been Mr. Hollinshead's
policy throughout his entire life and
never has it once been said that he
misrepresented in his dealings. Not
often is it permitted that two people
may live together so many years, and
the friends and neighbors, who have
known them, whether many or few
years, hope they may yet be spared to
each other and their loved ones a few
years yet. They are in fairly good
health, and with the sister with them,
three old people together, they enjoy
life, living as happily in the memories
of the past as when that time was the
present. The entire comunity extends
congratulations to them on attaining
such a good old age together and best
wishes for their remaining days. May
they be peaceful ones.

Ready for Work on
Big Equity Elevator
St. Paul, April 14.—The contract for
the foundation for the new terminal
elevator, that is being erected by the
Equity Co-operative Exchange, at St.
Paul, was let last Monday to the W. J.
Hoy company. The foundation will
cost the Equity farmers approxi
mately $25,000. The elevater will be a
fireproof cement structure, 150 feet
long, 50 feet wide, and 150 feet high,
and the capacity of the elevator will
be approximately 300,000 bushels to
begin with, and it is so constructed
that additional storage bins can be
added at any time, using the same
work-house, Tanks can be added,
which will increase the capacity to
several million bushels without any
additional expense for work-houses,
grain cleaning machinery, etc.
The contractors will have the ele
cator completed and ready to turn
over to the farmers by Aug. 15, 1916.
The cost of the structure, as it will
be finished at the present time, will
be approximately $150,000. The equip
ment of the elevator will be complete
and will include car pullers, track
scales, power shovels for unloading
grain, a receiving pit at side of track,
two Richardson grain separators that
are second to none on the market for
the separation of mixed grains, one
2,000-bushel hopper scale for weighing
out grain, oat clipper, grain dryers,
screening separators, man lifts, etc.
Electric power will be used through
out the building in general the ma
chines are to be driven by individual
motors.
The elevators will be put in use Aug.
15, but will be formally dedicated at
the annual celebration on Dec. 5, 6 and
7, at which time there will be the larg
est gathering of farmers in St. Paul
that has ever been held in the north

Young Requests Interior
Department to Use N.D.
Lignite in Benzoil Tests
Washington, April 17.—Representa
tive George M. Young, of Valley City,
N. D., is urging the secretary of the
interior to experiment with North Da
kota lignite for benzoil. He informs
the secretary that the Co operative
Coal company of Haines, N. D., would
furnish coal free for experimental pur
poses. The secretary informed the
representative tonight that he would
give the matter careful investigation.
Congressman Young said that ijn
view of the high price of gasoline,
Germany is producing benzoil from
the lignite mines in Austria and that
the results so far have been astound
ing. The congressman pointed out
that North Dakota has an unlimited
supply of lignite.
A. O. Lee, of the Right Price groc
ery department, received word Friday
tflorning that he was the daddy of a
fine girl born to his wife at Balfour
where she is with her parents, Mr.
and Mrs. O. P. Helseth. Mother and
daughter are doing nicely.
P. M. Hanson, from Nome, made a
stay of a few hours here Monday after
noon.
Ladd Hows How N. D. Farmers
Lose Money on Grain Grades
ESTABLISHED IVTti
Fargo, Apirl 18.—E. F. Ladd, head
of the North Dakota Agricultural col
lege and of the department of chem
istry, appearing before the North Da
kota railroad and warehouse commis
sioners in session at the Waldorf ho
tel yesterday morning, reiterated his
previous contentions in defense of a
new system of grain grading, declar
ing that investigations conducted by a
number of authorities at the college
show that there is an actual difference
between No. 1 hard and rejected wheat
in cash value of 6 cents for milling
purposes and that the spread in price
is 21 cents.
Loss of 15 Cents to Farmers
He made the disclosure that the
farmer is losing 15 cents a bushel on
grain marketed and that the miller or
someone else makes the profit. He as
serted that it was his idea to have the
commissioners devise some means by
which that difference could be elimin
ated and grain be paid for on its actual
merits. His method of procedure sug
gested would be to either lower the
weights or equalize the price.
What Advertising Will Do.
The North Dakota housewife, Presi
dent Ladd told the commissioners, will
read the colored advertisements on the
back pages of many of the leading
magazines telling of Washburn-Crosby
flour, and other makes, and then de
mand such flour from the merchants.
According to the chemist, the best
flour in the world is made in North Da
kota. She is killing off the millers of
the state, who are working at a big
disadvantage against the big milling
interests who have a system of temp
ering the wheat before grinding it.
Tests Are Definite
Dr. Ladd explained to the railroad
commission members that extensive
tests conducted at the Agricultural col
lege during the past few years had re
vealed the porportionate milling value
of the several grades of wheat.
These findings, said Dr. Ladd, bore
out findings previously made in South

Albert Holland Gets Patent
on His Wild Oats Separator
Albert Hoiland, a former resident of
Barnes county, now making Fargo his
headquarters, has received a patent
from the government for his wild oats
separator. He is at present engaged
in manufacturing it for the trade.
The Fargo Courier-News says:
Albert J. Hoiland of Fargo, manu
facturer of the Hoiland wild oat sep
arator, which was shown at the Home
Products show held in the auditorium
last winter( has been granted a patent
which was issued April 4. The separ
ator is rotatory, corrugated, adjustable
sieve, adjustable for all kinds of small
grains, from corn to flax. This de
vice fits inside the drum of the wild
oats separator and cleans the dust out
as well as grading the grain before
entering the wild oats separator.
"During the last few years there
have been many threshing machine
separators fitted up with adjustable
sieves," said Mr. Hoiland yesterday,
"but so far there has never been a
fanning mill or grader on the market
with adjustable sieves, as there has
always been from 10 to 16 different
sieves on each grader purchased."
This is done away with in the new de
vice, according to the manufacturer.
Mr. Hoiland stated that the new de
vice has been thoroughly tested and
that machines will be placed on the
market next season.
