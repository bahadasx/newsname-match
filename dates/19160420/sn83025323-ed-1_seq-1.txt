As one passes up and down the
imperial Milk River valley today and £
notes the many improvements that ]
have been made in recent years it
seems to the old tinier like it is all ]
one great dream.
Twenty years ago countless
herds roamed at will along the

with here and there a scattering t
ranch home. Had one told you then
that today this would all be changed
you would have said they were lo
coed or there was something the
matter with their heads.
Nevertheless we, who are here
today get a far different view as
we journey through this same val
ley.. Between Glasgow and Malta,
originally part of the vast range of t
the olden days, you now see scores
and, yea hundreds of homestead I
shacks that dot the prairies nearly
as thick as the bands of sheep did of t
old. Hard as it was for the old time I

northern Montana.
Whether this great change has I
been for the betterment of the coun- t

here just the same, only it is being I

it today goes into farm machinery,
bank stock, farm loans and the like.
The spirit of the west has not been,
killed in this great change. People
in Montana today are just as liberal

twenty and twenty-five years ago.
And why? Simply because the west

PLANT TO CLOSE MAY 1ST.
A mass meeting was called at the
city hall last Friday night to take
steps, if possible, to keep the electric
light plant in operation. The man
agers of the plant claim they are
running it at a loss each night and
had given notice to the consumers
that the plant would be closed down
that night. There are a number in
the city depending entirely on elec
tricity for lights and the closing of
the plant would work a hardship on
them, and after a great deal of ar
gument and some financial aid by
two of the heavy consumers, an
agreement was reached whereby the
plant will be kept running until the
first of the coming month.
The people of Malta can hardly
ask tihe light company to run the
plant at a loss and on the other hand
the company can hardly expect the
people to reimburse them for their
loss if the plant is not a paying prop- I
osition. The proper thing to do is
for the city to take over the plant.
or that part of it that is in good con
dition and run it in connection with
the water works. The city could
run the lights at a far less expense
than a Company and do it with very
little additional help.
We understand a petition will be
circulated in a few days asking the
taxpayers of the city to petition the
Icity council to take over the light
plant.
L. K. Devlin of Havre, deputy
state humane officer, was attending
court in Malta this week.
Dudley Jones was in the city from
Dodson the first of the week attend
ing to business matters.
