Colonel Ruffin G. Pleasant Our Next Governor
Democratic Nominee Elected Oovernior by Handsome
Majority--Col. Pleasant Carries New Orleans by
Nearly 12.)000 More Votes Than His Opponent,
and the Country Has Done Twice as Well.
The ft)llowing figures on 'ues. r
day's election from the Times- J
Picayune, a Parker organ, gives f
Pleasant's majority as 22 000 at I
midnilht Tuesday. Later re
turns. however, have run them
ul) in the neighborhood of about
40,00. r
Col Il. G. Pleasant, Democratic
nominpe, was elected governor I
over John M. Parker, P'rogres- (
sive Indepeniient, by a majority i
close to 25,000. Fernand Mou- p
ton, Democratic nominee for I
lieutenant governor, won over fi
Edwin S. Broassard by about the d
same vote. f
Col. Pleasant carried New Or- s
leans by 11,451 votes out of a
re  otal vote of 40,4365, the ti
vote being Pleasant 25,958, and
* Parker 14,507. a
Returns from about two-thirds d
of the country precincts, approx- s8
imately sixty per cent of all the it
state, givee Pleasant 32,474; ti
Parker 21,299. The vote ,in the ft
parishes as in the city, was re- P
markably heavy, and a total of C
85,000 to 90,000 in the country w
would not be surprising. et
In the Seventh Congressional
District, Parker carried St. Lan- th
dry by a big majority and wi
-'--vangeline and Acadia by small pr
i majorities on incomplete returns.
s- Jefferson Davis parish is doubt
s ful, Beauregard has gone for
it Pleasant by a small majority, and
3- Allen and Calcasieu for Pleasant
n by considerable majorities. The
It Seventh District will net a small
majoriy for Pleasant it appears.
c In the Sixth Congressional
ir District Parker carried Pi'nte
- Coupee, West Baton Ronge and
y Ascension also Iberville. Tangi
Spahoa, St. Tamumany and St.
r Helena are close on incomplete
figures. East Baton Rouge was
a disappointing to the Parker
forces, and Washington went
- strong for Pleasant. The Sixth
a District gave Pleasant a substan
e tial majority.
I North Louisiana went solidly
against the indedendent candi
9 date, the far northern parishes
swamping him. Notwithstand
ing the entire absence of opposi
tion in those parishes, almost a
full vote overl'helmingly for
Pleasant, showed up in returns,
Caddo, Rapides and Ouachita,
where Parker expected to break
even, were sore disappointments.
Beautiful weather throughout
the state ,contributed largely to
ward tue big vote. The country
preci7,, in every portion of the
state turnir Lz up with a'),iornimal
votes.
" The Parker showing *in New
Orleans, in some respect1, w is
disappointing to his floil )wers and
to others very pleasing. The
vote in the uptown wards was
very encouraging, a marked in
crease over the Hall vote being 5
r in evidence. In the l,)wer wards,
except the Sventh, Eighth and

r
Col. Ruffin G. Pleasant. f,
Ninth, there was a falling off
from the reform vote of four years
ago. The total figure was very
close to conservative calculations, tÂº
however. c
Mr. Parker carried the Twelfth .1
Fourteenth, and Sixteenth wards a
and lost the Seventeenth by 59 tl
votes. His vote of 14,507 In the
city was 521 better than that
polled by Governor Hall four
years ago, F
At midnight Tuesday, after q
spending the evening at his e
headquarters receiving reports, 6
Mr. Parker went to his home to
rest. He declined to make any
statement until official and more
complete figures are avaliable.
W. T. Peterman, campaign man
ager for Mr. Parker also declined
to comment on the returns.
At Pleasant headquarters,
Philip Werlein, vice-chairman of
the Democratic State Central
Committee and John Marshall,
secretary in charge of the cam
paign, estimated Col. Pleasant's
majority at midnight at from 30,- 1
000 to 35,000. 1
Col. Pleasantt who was in ]
Shreveport to vote, phoned the ]
city late in the evening to express
his thanks for the splendid vote
given him in New Orleans.
Col. Pleasant gave out the fol
lowing statement about 11 o'clock
)after enough returns had oeen
received to indicate the certainty
of his election:
"'The election returns indicate
that the Democratic party is still
supreme in the state of Louisiana.
STo all loyal Democrats I wish to t
Sexpress my deepest appreciation c
and sincerest thanks for their j
Ssplendid support, They may
) rest assured that I will use every
energy that I posess in an effort
Sto make our administration of
the state's affairs a success."
Col. Pleasant received hun- 1
0 dreds of telegrams of congratu- (
lation from difierent parts of the i
O state.
o Notwithstanding the record
vote and theunusual amount of I
interest manifested in the contest
0 the day passed off peacefully
Severywhere as far as reported
0 Tuesday night. In New Orleans
o minor friction occurred through-l
0 out the day but prompt adjust
_ Inent of differenoes obviated ser
lioa trouble,
