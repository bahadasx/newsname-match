Pursuit of Villa at a Standstill
Because of the Fear of Arm
ed Opposition by Car
ranzaists. El I'aso, Tex., April 18. The
American troops in southern Chi
liaulian have retreated almost "0
miles northward, owing to evi-.
deuces of increased hostility on
the part of the Mexicans and lack
oxuppnes.
A"u attempt to assassinate Gen.
Pershing was made hy snipers
near Providencia while he and his
escort andNi small body of caval
ry, were on nunr way hack to the
base at Namiquipa from the front.
Bullets suddenlyegan to spat
ter around (fen. IVrsbing, as the
Americans arrived (itlio out
skirts of the village. .
The Americans dismount in
stantly and returned" the fire.
Most of the snipers Averesilencea.
Those who continued to fire were
driven from their adobe shelters
by soldiers who crept upon them
and ejected them by.. a flank fire.
The Americans are reported to
have taken several ' prisoners
without- suffering any loss front
killed or wounded, The detach
ment then continued its north
ward journey.
General Pershing now is hack
at his headquarters and making
plans for meeting the. critical sit
uation which has arisen.
The pursuit of Villa is at ii
standstill .because of the "unpro
voked attack upon the American
troops at Parral by Carranzistas.
At.- Gen. Persljiug s headquar-
fers there, was no intimation ol.
when it would be resumed, while
there were many indications that
armed resistance would be offer
ed hy de facto troops.
Carranza soldiers apparently
have taken the first chief's de
mand for withdrawal of the Unit-
d States troops as their cue for
ceasing to co-operate in the hunt
for-Villa". While not openly hos
tile, they at least are not doing
anything to aid the Americans.
American officers are very
skeptical about the report from
Mexico tliat N'ilJa had died as
a result of wounds received in
a fight with Carranza troops
about a week ago. It is feared
that the report -is inspired by
Villa sympathizers so that the P.
S. -troops will be -recalled from.
