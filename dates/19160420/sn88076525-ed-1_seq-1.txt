ELEPHANTS
ARE USEFUL
San Diego, Cal., April 19.—Eleph
ants and camels, carrying two machine
gun sections of the 2Sth Company of
Hie United States Marine Corps,
quartered at the exposition here, took
part in experimental maneuvers and
quickly demonstrated the feasibility
of their 1 use in actual warfare condi
tions as now obtain in Mexico.
Mounting one operator and tripod
machine gun to an eleplant, attended
by several U. S Marines op foot, the
elephants displayed satirising agility
in traveling over rough ground and
wheeling into proper position for fir
ing. The elephants, when ordered to
lie down made a perfect breastworks,
behind which the Marines were en
abled in thirty seconds to employ an
effective machine gun fire.
Both elephants and camels would
prove useful in an extended campaign
such as the present one in Mexico, an
official declared, for both can carry
large loads and can go long distance
without water. Elephants are more
nervous under fire than camels, but
proper training they can be cured of
gun-shyness.
Tuesday night it began raining and
rained all day yesterday, a large
amount of water felling. Owing to
the large amount of water caused this
'Spring by the melting snow and then
this heavy rain oh top of that there 1
will be nothing done toward seeding I
for. several days yet. The outlook is
that but very little seeding will be
done much before May 1, and the re
re
suit is going to be a large decrease
in wheat acreage in this part of the
-state this year. It don't look now as
though there would be more than one-
Tmif the usual wheat acreage in this
section, unless it is put in too late to
insure a crop. This means that there
will be a large acreage of oats, barley

BIG DANCE IS
A SUCCESS
The House'warming or dance given
in the new Masonic Temple Friday
evening last was one of the most
pleasant social events ever held in this
city. It was a splendidly arranged af
fair and the crowd was all that could
be well accommodated in this beauti
ful temple. The entire building war
thrown open to those in attendance
.and besides enjoying themselves trip
ling the light fantastic, the inspection
-of the building throughout caused
much pleasure to those who had not
visited it before. Members of the
Eastern Star furnished- a splendid
supper and the dancing kept up until
the we sma' hours of the morning.
TEMPLE FLAG
AT HALF NIAST
Only a few days after the flag was
^'hoisted oyer the beautiful new Ma
sonic home, was there an occasion for
its being floated at half mast. The
death of Peter Haley, who belonged
to the various Masonic bodies of the
city was,the cause of the flag being
at half mast Monday and Tuesday.

WORLD—VOLUME VI. NUMBER DEVILS LAKE NORTH DA
Bro. Albert Jf. Powell delivered the
following memorial address:—
Worthy Matron, Worthy Patron
Sisters and Brothers.
By an official -edict -oftheNational
Grand Chapter, we are assembled this
peaceful Sabbath afternoon to pay our
humble tribute to the memory of Rata
A. Mills, Most Worthy Grand Matron
of the Supreme Chapter, and to those
of our own Chapter whom in the past
years, since our last memorial, "God's
finger has tauched, and they sleep.":
Judge David E. Morgan.
Mrs. Celia Duell Larson.
Mrs. Mary Collinson Hoskins.
Mrs. Peter G. Timboe.
Mr. Stephen C. Jones,
Mrs. Anna Elmslie Graham.
Mr. Augustus Fursteneau,
Mrs. Marion Pecholt.
For these the dawn has broken—it
is day! They have been called to the
"Beautiful Isle of Somewhere." "They
have walked the still road that leads
from the sepulchre to the seraphim.
They dwell now under the shadows of
great mountains whose heights shall
never put off the crimson glories of
eternity."
Today we bring a tribute of res
pect and esteem in memory of these
who have passed the great divide.
But really what we call death does not
in very truth divide or separate us
from them—they have merely gone be
fore. We are further down in the
endless procession from time to eter
nity—from earth to heaven.
It is said that all lives are beautiful
in which the sovereign thought haB
been for others, and this is eminently
true of those whose virtues we are
called to commemorate and whose self
sacrificing example we should try to
emulate.
In a few words would we sum up
the achievements of these useful, loyal
and brave lives. Each in her or his
sphere gave the years of service
grudgingly and cheerfully. Or the
man of the street, in every day verna
cular would say, "Each bravely played
the game of life till death call out
'Check': the die was cast, the record
closed." But is their record closed?
With the passing of these few fast
fleeting years that God loans us, is
the record ended? Yes, if death ends
all.
But if we take that larger, that san
er, that more comforting view given
us by divine revelation, that in our
brief earthly pilgrimage we are only
treading the vestibule leading to an
eternity of bliss and joy, that in dying
we just begin to live, then the record
of our lives has only begun. The few
pages here written may not be free
from spot or blemish—but what the
Scripture^ so significantly titles "the
Lambs' Book of Life" will take up and
continue the record of each life in all
the future cycles of eternity.
The memories of their lives will
long abide with us as sweet benedic-
rf^*-^v ,VJ.

tions. Brave and gentle spirits—
farewell. It is not our province to
enter into any extended eulogy of
these departed members. The one fil
led for many years stations of the
highest trust and honor in the Nation
al Supreme Chapter, the others in the
limited sphere of our subordinate
chapter members also did their full
duty.
The true treasures of an organiza
tion are its members. Neither death
nor time can take them from us. The
members die but memory of their char
acter and life survive and serve as a
perpetual inspiration to emulate their
example. The toll which death ex
acts each year reminds us that we too
are but those of whom others shall
say tomorrow, "They are the dead."
And then in some memorial services
of the future it may be said of each
of us—as we are saying of them:
"They have deposited upon the sil
ent shore
Of memory, image, and precious
thoughts
That shall not die, and can not £e
destroyed.
That shall not die, and can not be
destroyed.
There is no Death! What seems so
is transition
This life of mortal breath
Is but a suburb of the life elysian,
Whose portal we call Death!
Death is* mighty mystery, but so
is life. Once a poet's love lay dead.
He was dreamer of great and beauti
ful dreams and had woven many a
sweet fancy into rhytmic verse. On
his knee sat his little one gazing at
the dead white face, her trusting child
love throbbing about her wounded
heart and melting in her eyes of bltie.
He said, "You do not know what it
is, dear?" and added, "Nor do I."
We know not what it is, dear, this
sleep so deep and still
The folded hands, the awful calm,
the cheek so pale and stfyl
The lids that will not lift again,
though we may call and call
The strange white solitude of peace
that settles over all.
But this we know: Our loved and
dead, if they should come this
day—
Should come and ask us, "What is
life?" hot one of us could say.
Life is a mystery as deep as ever
death can be.
"Life" and "Death" are the two
most mementous words in the human
tf?i

GOV. L. B. HANNA
Who is now seeking th? Republican Nomination lor
language.
"Oh, that I had time to weep!" This
was the exclamation of Napoleon when
on one of hisi bloody battle-fields he
beheld the ghostly corpse of a brave
young soldier who had fallen in the
fight. How often, has that emotion
welled up in our hearts as one by one
we have seen our sisters and brothers
called by death. And yet perhaps it
is well, that we do not have time to
weep well that the overruling de
mands of love for. the living and of
duty to the obligations which Provid
ence has placed upon us, should con
strain us from the mournful thoughts
and heartrending scenes that attend
the place of death. And after all, we
can do nothing for the dead but lay
them down at the foot of the cross,
and utter -the cry of .mortal submis
sion to divine decree "Thy will be
done." It is for ourselves, for these
around us, for those that come here
after, that we proclaim the virtues of
the dead, that we uplift their good ex
amples, and that we contemplate their
end as the inevitable lot.
If some would escape death, and if
only some were doomed to-die, life
would be vexed with new harrass
ments and infelicities. In the impar
tiality of death there is taught the
lesson of human brotherhood. With
Death, equality is. equity. A just
creditor ,Death exacts from each and
all an equal due. If there be gloom
in this reflection thei'i is also some
consolation. Death can not be wholly
evil and wholly sorrowful, seeing that
it is universal, that it is the fixed, in
evitable, invariable, unappealable law
of Him who rules forever.
Let somber triumphs Wait upon my
bier:
I'll not forgive that friend who
sheds one tear.
Let no unworthy sounds of grief be
heard, ....
No loud laments, not one unseem'y
word
For whether gathered in life is
early morn,
Or in old age he drops, like an ear
of corn
Full ripe, he dies on nature's noble
plan
Who lives to reason, and who dies
a man.
One of the basic teachings of the
Order of the Eastern Star is the belief
in immortality. A week from today

tion. May the exercises of this hour
strengthen our faith in eternal life
and liven our hope of a blessed reunion
with all who have led the way. If
with the shepherds of old we can truly
say "We have seen His Star in the
East and have come to worship Him.",
then this services is at once a tribute
to the dead, and an inspiration for the
living.
Life! I know not what thou art,
But this I know, that thou and I
must part
And when or where or how we meet,
I own to me's a secret yet.
Life! we've been long together,
Through pleasant and through
cloudy weather.
'Tis hard to part when friends are
dear,
Perhaps't will cost a sigh, a tear—
Then steal away—give little warn
ing,
Choose thine own time, say not "Good
night!"
But in some brighter clime bid me
"Good morning!"
P. W. Heath has sold the Dairy
Lunch to Wm. Foote and Chas. Gable,
two young men who have been employ
ed by Mr. Heath for seme time. They
are both competent to conduct the bus
iness and there is no doubt but what
they will keep this popular eating
place up to the high standard it has
attained. In turn Mr. Heath has pur
chased the property known as the
Zunith hotel at the corner of Second

have the same remoddled and fitted up
for a hotel and eating house.
E. E. Rorapaugh, who for years
travelled for the Grand Forks Herald,
and sold blank books and stationery
and well known to a large number of
people in the state, was a visitor in
the city Saturday for the first time
many years, and was a pleasant
caller at our office. Mr. Rorapaug-T'
recently came here from his home at
Eugene, Oregon, and is now traveling
for the Non-Partisap Leader, solicit-
One of Devils Lake Most Honored
Citizens Called to His Reward.
He came with his family to Devils
Lake and in 1889 established himself
in the implement business in this city
and for many years was one of oiu*
well known business men. His reputa
tion for hinesty and fair dealing made
him a large circle of friends and his
business grew to be one of the leadin.tr
implement houses in this part of the
state. A few years ago his little part
ner passed away, and owing to his in
creasing years he decided to retire
from active business'and turned his
implement business to his son, Clar
ence, who is now conducting it. He
leaves two children, Clarence and Miss
First National Bank of this city, and
a grand son, Wendell, who is attending
college at Washington, D. C., a sister,
Mrs. Tyler of Duluth and a brother,
Martin, of St. Paul.
Mr. Haley was a member of the
local blue lodge, Chapter, Command
eryand Shrine and was also a member
of the Masonic Veterans' Association
and of the local G. A. R.
The funeral services were held in
the Masonic temple of this city and
were conducted by the Knights Temp
lar, as this was the request of the de
ceased and Sir Knight Clarence A.
Hale took charge of the ceremonies,
this also being a request of Mr. Haley.
The various Masonic bodies were out
in large numbers and the crowd was
a large one as he was a man who was
highly respected by all who knew him,
and all were anxious to pay their last
respects to their departed friend and
brother. After the regular Masonic
ceremonies at the Temple the quar
tette rendered beautiful hymns
and Mrs. C. A. Conant sang a solo.
Rev. Wallace of Park River delivered
a brief, yet splendid sermon, and the
remains were followed to their last
resting place in the G. A. R. Cemetery
where the last Masonic rites were pro
nounced, and Rev. F. H. Oehler de
livered the closing prayer.
It was one of the largest funerals
seen in our city for some time, and
only went to show the high esteem in
which the deceased was held.

INTER-OCEAN—VOLUME XXXIII. NUMBER 46
PETER HALEY IS CALLED
TO HIS FINAL REWARD
Again the peeple of Devils Lake
and Ramsey county are called upon to
mourn the death of one of its most
highly respected citizens, and one who
has been identified with the upbuild
ing and growth of the city and county.
Peter Haley, one of the old timers and
an old soldier, passed away at his
home in this city Saturday morning,
April 15, after a sickness of only two
weeks' duration, the immediate cause
of his death being blight's disease.
Mr. Haley was born in Carlysle, N.Y.
June 12, 1S40 and lived with his fath
er until the war broke out when he
volunteered his services to his country
and served with honor and credit for
four long years and many times was
in the thickest of the battle. He was
a member of Co. C. 144tii regiment of
New York. After the war he located
at Blooming Prairie, Minn., where he
was married to Caroline Patte, and
later he engaged in business at Austin,
Minn
RE-ELECTION
Bismarck, N. D., April 12.—W. C.
Taylor formally announced his candi
dacy for re-election to the office of
commissioner of insurance, as follows:
To the Republican Electors of the
State of North Dakota: I am a candi
date for the office of commissioner of
insurance. I am now serving my
third term in that office, and my can
didacy is submitted on the ground of
efficient service, faithful attention to
duty, and a desire to further assist in
placing the entire structure of insur
ance on a more substantial basis in
this state. The program I have in
mind calls for the enactment of a com
plete and humorous insurance code, to
take the place of the hodge-podge of
laws, many of them more or less con
tradictory, which have been enacted
from time to time since statehood.
The state should have supervision
of insurance rates as well as of the
insurance companies authorised tQ
transact business therein This ap-*
plies with special force to fire insur
ance rates, but I believe it should also
be extended to provide regulation of
rates charged by surety companies.
Insurance is a public necessity, no
less than railroad, telegraph and tel
phone..sj»tejns..-EvMt mots intimate*
than any of these utilities it enters
into the very woof and wazp of our
social and industrial fabric. It was in
recognition of this fact that the Unit
ed States Supreme Court recently said
that "the business of fire insurance is
so far affected with public interest as
to justify legislative regulation of its
rates." If re-elected I shall renew
the efforts which were inaugurated in
the last legislature to secure super
vision of rates.
Life insurance is written either on
what ig known as the "legal reserve
basis" or the "assessment plan." So
far as legal assessment life insurance
is concerned, I believe its writing
should be confined exclusively to fra
ternal benefit societies, and on ade
quate rates. There would not seem to
be any legitimate reason or demand
for assessment life associations, and
this state might well follow the ex
ample of othter states in expressly ex
cluding them from its borders. Cer- s.
tainly the present lack of definition in
that particular should be corrected.
Demands upon the time and atten
tion of the commissioner of insurance
in examining disputed claims for in
demnity, under policies of accident and
health insurance, has grown alarm* .g
ly. This is due to the vague, indefi
nite and misleading character of these
contracts. Standard forms should be
prescribed by legislative enactment,
as in the case of fire insurance and life
insurance.
The state department of insurance"
is not merely or primarily a record'.
office. The duties devolving upon the
commissioner of insurance are highly
technical, and call for an intimate
knowledge of th ein insurance laws
and at least a reasonable degree of ad.
ministrative ability. These qualifica
tions can be acquired, if at all, only by
experience. In this connection attcn
tion is called to the fact that in addi
tion to the steadily increasing amount
of work devolving upon this Office as ft
result of teh rapid growth of the in
surance business, and the responsibil
ity and labors of the commissioner ot
insurance have been immeasurably en
larged from the fact that he has teen
charged with supervision of thr state
hail insurance fund, the fire marshal
law and the state bonding fund. It is
true, that the law creating the state
bonding, fund is not operative at pres
ent, but it is likely to become egective
within a short time.
The state of North Dakota owes me
nothing. On the contrary I am deeply
indebted to the.people of this state
and in thatwgpirit—in the desire to give
better service to our people than it has
been possible for me to give in the
past—my candidacy is submitted.
WALTER C. TAYLOR
