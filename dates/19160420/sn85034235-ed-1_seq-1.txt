He found Sledge standing up, and
then he knew that there was some
thing in the wind.
"Get Bozzam," directed Sledge, and
Oendix went straight out to the tele
phone.
"Get Davis," directed Sledge when
Bendix came back, and Beudix, vague
ly pitying somebody, hurried out to
the telephone again.
"Get Feeder," was the next order.
Bendix almost whistled as he hurried
out to locate by telephone the ex-eouu
ty treasurer, who for two years had
been drawing a handsome salary from
Sledge for keeping his mouth shut
about the public funds scandal.
"Get Gaily," rumbled Sledge, who
had not moved from his contemplative
post by the window, and Bendix, keep
ing his growing wonder to himself and
replying with a shrug to the soberly
questioning glauce of the concerned
Phil, telephoned for the Sledge leader
In the city council.
Sledge, having sent for everybody
he needed, was sitting more quietly in
his accustomed chair when Bendix re
turned from his last trip and was look
ing with his usual stolidness out of the
window after having donned the fresh
red rose, which he had put on reli
giously three times a day since he had
met Molly Marley.
"Council meeting this afternoon?"
he asked.
"Two-thirty," answered Bendix.
"How much of the stock is sub
scribed in the reorganized street rail
way?"
"Hundred and eighty-five thousand.
I got tlie report just before I came
over."
"Get ours ou the market Gum shoe
sales, but do it quick."
"Who's to be soaked — Marley ?"
guessed Bendix.
"The limit," assented Sledge.. "Ben
dix, what's the worst they could hand
me on that public funds case?"
"Two or three years if they got you
going," judged Bendix. "That's dead
now, however." *
"It's back."
"Has Feeder been talking?"
Sledge nodded.
"Who knows anything?"
"Glider—Marley."
"Hunh!" grunted Bendix in uncon
scious imitation of Sledge. "What are
you going to do?"
"Call it."
"You don't mean to bring It to a
showdown!" protested Bendix. "We
can't afford it with Lansdaleand Blake
on the bench. Judge Lansdalc espe
cially would part with his right arm
to toss a harpoon into you."
"Get rid of him."
"I don't see how," worried Bendix.
"We've tried for two years to get
something on him. He can't be reach
ed, and I don't think it's safe to heat
him up."
Sledge pondered that matter weighti
ly and sighed.
"Give him a big law job."
"We haven't anything fat enough ex
cept the Distillers' and Brewers'
league, but we promised that plum to
the governor."
"Give it to Lansdale," ordered Sledge.
•Til send Waver to Switzerland. 1
want his house, anyhow."
"You promised a consulship to Hoov
?r. It's the only one Washington lets
you name."
"Hoover's a nit," declared Sledge,
turning slightly toward Bendix by way
of emphasis. "He goes in the dis
card."
"Good work!" approved Bendix.
"Young Bailey Cooper has made a joke
of Hoover's leadership. I think Waver
has been counting on this Distillera*
and Brewers' job, though. It takes a
good man to fight the dry fad? and
Waver knows it."
"He has to go to Switzerland," de
cided Sledge.
"How about Blake?" asked Bendix.
"We'll take a chance."
Bendix shook his head.
"Blake's against you," he warned.
"Besides that, there's an election com
ing off."
"We lose," Sledge rumbled. "We're
due, anyhow."
"I guess you're right," agreed Ben
dix reluctantly. "So long as we have
to lose we might as well make it a good
one. If there's any other scandal about
us we may as well arrange to have it
sprung and get it all cleaned up at
once."
"Fix I.ansdale today!" commanded
Sledge.
"I'll go see Schwarzman this noon
and, of course, have him offer the Job
to Lansdale, so he won't imagine it
comes from us. Schwarzman, though,
didn't want to change his legal depart
ment until fall. That won't do, I sup
pose?"
"Today," announced Sledge.
"I got you," replied Beudix, rising.
"If Lansdale takes the job he'll have
to resign from the bench immediate
ly," and no assent tq this being neces
sary, be hurried out to make an ap
pointment with the president of the
Distillers' and Brewers' league.
Bozzam came, suave, smiling, a more
polished gentleman than anybody, but
not offensive with it.
"How goes it?" asked Sledge.
"Splendidly," said Bozzam. "The
stock's all sold, including our own.
We're ready to move on uuless we can
put over a real good organization of
some sort. We don't want another lit
tle one, though. Traction companies
are our game."
"Get busy." remarked Sledge.
"With the original traction thought?
A grunt of assent was Sledge's reply
as he looked out along the high board
fence which bound in the narrow area
way. A tiling which had once been a
mop leaned in a corner by one of the
scantlings, decaying.
Bozzam looked at Sledge for a mo
ment and, being a gentleman of rare
penetration, rightly concluded that hi*
errand was over.
"Good day." he said and started for
the door.
Bendix and a big blue eyed man with
a square jaw and muscular shoulders
came in. and Bendix introduced the
latter to Bozzam as Jim Gaily. The
two gentlemen exchanged grins as they
shook hands, but neither one of them
was careless enough to state that they
had already met, although, as a mat
ter of fact, Mr. Gaily now possessed
the exclusive bar privilege at the new
amusement park.
"Stick around, Bozzam," said Sledge.
"Tom. Bozzam gets his car line. Gaily
will fix the franchises."
Bendix. although the project and
Sledge's resolution were, absolutely
new to him, never battetf an eyelash.
"We'll get together on* that at the
hotel in about an hour," be told Gaily
and Bozzam. "Nothing ready to give
out to the papers, is there, Sledge?"
"Xaw!"
"You'd better explain to Bozzam
what you want in the way. of routes,"
suggested Bendix. "The franchises
should be passed in secret session. Gai
ly. Is everybody all right?"
"It's a family reunion," declared
Gaily. "Is that all, Sledge?" '
"Wait," said Sledge and looked out
at the mop.
Everybody sat down, and there
seemed to be some Important topic In
abeyance. They Indulged In no trifling
conversation, hut looked out of the
window. Bendix ordered drinks, which
they consumed silently and solemnly.
Sledge evidently had some weighty
plan on his mind, for he only drank
half his beer.
Davis of the First National came in,
a pompous man, with n fish fat double
chin and pompous white side whiskers
and a white waistcoat. JIe„ stood at
the other side of the tab%
beckoned him -closer, and*'
tug an Impenetrable air of mystery,
leaned his whiskered ear far down.
"Call Mariey's loans," rumbled the
boss in a tone which at three feet
away sounded like a tuba sawmill.
"Is he shaky?" Inquired Davis in a
panic stricken whisper.
"He will be," promised Sledge.
"Why, he owes the bank $35,000!" re
turned Davis, more panic stricken than
ever, and his whispering sounded like
the exhaust of a safety valve. "I'll go
right away and protect the bank.
What bas happened to him. Mr.
Sledge?"
"Nothing yet." stated Sledge. "Sit
down, Davis."
Mr. Davis sat down, and the four
who had beeu told to wait looked at
one another with growing wonder and
at tlie impassive big man, who was
still drawing inspiration from the de
crepit mop.
Five minutes passed. Bendix and
Bozzam and Gaily sat in comfortable
quiet, resting all their faculties, phys
ical, mental and moral, but Mr. Davis
fidgeted audibly. He twiddled his tin
gers, he fussed with his cravat, he
ran slip nooses in his watch cord, he
wiped liis reading glasses and put them
on and took them off.
Five minutes more passed. Mr. Da
vis in desperation rang the bell for
the velvet footed Adolph and ordered
;i drink. In other gatherings Mr. Boz
tara would have enlivened the moment
with a story or with conversation and
repartee. On occasion he could have
sung a song or recited a poem or play
ed seven up, craps or tiddled.vwinks, ail
with the pleasing finish of a profes
sional. Just now, however, he remain
ed ns placidly calm as a cake of Swiss
cheese.
A step came down the narrow pas
sageway. A rawboned fellow appear
ed in the doorway! He was tall and
jig and wore good clothes. Ills bantu
were coarse and had bulbous finget
tips, with extremely broad, stubby
nails, hut they showed no signs of re
cent toil. He had a wide mouth and
prominent cheek bones-and a low fore
head. He looked like a retired coal
heaver. The exigencies of politics had
once made him county treasurer, and
since then lie had lived iu prosperous
idleness.
Sledge arose and walked around to
the front of the table.
"Say, Feeder," he growled, "I've beeu
paying you seventy-five a month for
two years. That right?"
"Yes," hesitated Feeder, with a puz
zled glance at the unusual crowd in
the little room.
"What for?" demanded Sledge.
Mr. Feeder smiled ingratiatingly, but
paled in the process.
"Campaign work," he replied.
"What for?" demanded Sledge.
"Well, I"— And, more puzzled than
ever, he looked around the equally
puzzled gatheriug. Even Bendix was
at a loss.
"What for, I say?" suddenly thun
dered Sledge.
"On the level?" inquired Feeder. "1
don't got this. Sledge. I don't see"—
"Tell 'em!" •
"Well, if you got to have It"—
He stopped, gave another glance at
his audience and stared at Sledge in
credulously.
Sledge advanced a step toward him
"I said tell 'em."
"Here goes, then," responded Feed
er, exasperated—"for keeping my mouth
shut about receiving the public funds
interest money for you."
"You're a liar!" boomed Sledge and,
suddenly stepping forward with mar
velous agility for so ponderous a man,
swung his right arm, the biceps of
which was like a thigh, and knocked
Feeder straight through the door.
"Throw him out," he directed and sat
down.
Bendix accepted that commission as
readily as if it had been a suggestion
to ring for another drink. A rather
heavy man himself, he stepped lightly
into the passageway, grabbed Feeder
by the collar as he was rising and
punched him in the ear. Phil and
Blondy, both gentlemanly bartenders,
selected for the hardness and limber
ness of their shoulders, came running
back as promptly as fire horses at the
sound of the gong.
"Rough toss," explained Bendix brief
ly, handing his collar hold to Phil.
There was a rattle of chairs and ta
bles and the crash of two or three
glasses interspersed with au occasional
smack. There were exclamations from
a few haugers on and a few inadver
tent oaths from the astonished Feeder,
but Phil and Blondy were voiceless
until, after battering Feeder at the
curb until a policeman came up. they
turned him over for a wagon call.
"What's the charge?" asked the offi
cer.
"Pink necktie, I think," returned
Phil. "But I'll find out." and he ran
A
•ödv
"You're a liarl" boomed Sledge.
back to Sledge's room. "Feeder's
pinched," he stated. "Want it to
stick?"
"Uh-lranh!" grunted Sledge.
"Copper's fussy. He wants to know
what's the charge."
Sledge took a slow survey of his wit
nesses, and the faintest possible sus
picion of a twinkle came into his small
gray eyes.
"Attempted blackmail," he chuckled.
CHAPTER VI.
Frank Marley Discovers a Great Team.
M OLLY stopped singiug as her
father called her into his den.
She hardly recognized his
voice, and his face was so
drawn and pale that she was startled.
"What's tlie matter, father? Are you
ill?" she asked, deeply concerned.
"Not at all." he assured her. "A
slight headache. Molly. I've been
thinking about your future all night,
and I am very much worried about
you. Bert has proved himself thor
oughly incapable. His fine old family
blood does not seem to support him in
a crisis."
"Did you expect anything else of old
family blood?" she demanded, smiling.
"I didn't."
"As your father, I cannot help being
concerned," replied Mr. Marley. "Bert
has done nothing but whine and make
weak threats and stay half intoxicated
ever since Sledge shook him away
from the complacent safety of his few
thousands."
"I've given him two weeks to get
over the shock," she lightly answered.
"He'll come up all waxed and curled."
"His time's almost up," her fathet
pointed out. "Molly, I think Sledge
proved a very good case against Bert.
He called him a pinhead."
Molly wanted to snicker, but she was
indignant instead.
"That's better than being a fathead,'
she retorted. "That's what Bert calls
Sledge. It seems to me that they're
about even."
"That's where they stop being even,'
declared Marley. "Sledge threatened
to break Bert and did it Bert threat
ened to expose Sledge, and Sledge beat
him to it."
"That's my fault," she half angrily
acknowledged. "I bragged."
"Bert led you to think you might,"
he countercharged. "He even had me
believing that 1 could defy Sledge, and
it can't be done, Molly. That man's
too big, too decisive and too fearless.
The minute he found that Bert, nod,
through him, you and I, kuew that
Feeder would prove Sledge's guilt in
the public funds case he sent for Feed
er, knocked him down, had him beaten
half insensible and arrested for at
tempted blackmail."
"He isn't just instantaneous—he's im
mediate," laughed Molly. "It was a
fool thing to do, though. Feeder has
exposed him and saved us the trouble,
aud Sledge probably will go to the
penitentiary, as I told him he would."
"You have innocent ideas," kindly
observed her father. "Bert probably
encourages you in them, but it Is my
duty to warn and protect you. Here
Is exactly what will happen: Feeder
will go to the penitentiary for the
crime of not having kept his moutb
shut Sledge will be indicted by the
grand jury, but the case will never
come to trial, ne has appointed half
the judges on the bench, and the other
half are afraid of him. His lawyers
will fight from court to court ou one
technicality after another until elec
tion Is over, and then the public will
forget all about it. You can't fight a
man like that."
"I cau be the one human being in
the world he can't order around," she
smilingly insisted. "What do you want
me to do—marry him?"
"Yes," was tlie unexpected reply.
"Great goodness," laughed Molly,
"are you bluffed too?"
"Worse!" lie said, rising and walking
up and down in the few short paces
the length of the room allowed him.
He had a crumpled newspaper in his
hand, and now he threw it on the
table. "Do you want to be turned
homeless into the street?"
"In the shivering snow with a little
red shawl over my head?" she giggled.
"No, father; gray heaven, no!"
"It Isn't n joke," he insisted, stop
ping before her, and now the mask of
constraint dropped from his face. "Mol
ly, you know that he threatened to
break me. Well, he has done it"
"Nonsense!" she replied, unable to
conceive of that condition in its actual
ity since there was no halt in their
luxury. "It is impossible."
"It is a fact," he stated as calmly as
he could. "At the various banks
which Sledge controls I had obliga
tions, which I thought were only nom
inally considered to be call loans, ag
gregating a hundred thousand dollars.
These were protected by my traction
stock. Last week the bank called them.
I recently received $87,500 In cash on
a certain deal, and I had considerable
trouble to raise the additional $12,500.
I had to deposit $25,000 worth of my
stock to secure it, and yesterday I had
to put.up twenty-five thousand more."
"But why?" asked Molly, sitting
down and considering the matter seri
ously for the first time.
"Because in one day merely by an
nouncing that he was financially back
ing a competing company Sledge low
ered the value of my stock from a hun
dred dollars a share to thirty-five.
That same announcement broke the
West End bank, has crippled two oth
ers and made paupers of a hundred ot
more small stockholders." . - .- to r
"How horrible!" she exclaimed. "The
poor people!" Then the wonder of
such power came to her. "With just
a word," she mused. "But, father, 1
don't see j et how he could do it. You
say that your stock was worth a hun
dred dollars a share yesterday morning
and only thirty-five now?"
He nodded his head in confirmation.
"Each share of stock represents a
certain part ownership of the street
railway company, doesn't it?"
Again he nodded.
"Well, the road is still there," she
argued. "You still own as much of it
as you did before. Wby, father, Sledge
has just scared everybody. Your stock
will be worth what it was, or nearly
so, after this panic is over. Even com
petition can't keep you from hauling
people and making mouey at it"
"It can keep us from hauling enough
to make anything like our previous
profits, and earning capacity is what
gives stock its value. That Is not the
big trouble now, however. I have a
$70,000 mortgage on this place, which
is all it would bring at a forced sale,
although it is worth double the money.
It expires on the 1st of the month,
and Sledge knows it It is held at one
of his banks, and it will not be ex
tended."
"You'll have to pay it," she surmised.
"What with?" he demanded. "At
the present prices, at which, by the
way, nobody cares to buy, It would
take every share of my stock to pay
off that mortgage. I would be abso
lutely penniless."
"How did you come to owe so
much?" she puzzled. "I thought we
were wealthy."
"That's tlie way business is carried
on." he explained.
"Then anybody can be broke,"
decided, with a trace of awe. "Why
don't some of you good business men
get after Sledge?"
He looked at her pityingly.
"It can't be done," he confessed.
"Molly"—
"I know what you're going to say,"
she interrupted him. "I won't do 1L
I'm going to marry Bert if it breaks
everybody!"
"That would be a very commenda
ble spirit if you loved him," he quietly
remarked. "I don't think you do, how
ever. Nor do I, by any means, believe
Bert capable of a love worth the sac
rifice of everything. The Maryland
Gliders do not constitute a universe in
themselves, nor Is much happiness to
be found in a marriage which is a so
cial triumph. I'm afraid, Molly, that
you're stubborn and will not let your
self criticize your own mind."
"Of course I'm stubborn!" she ad
mitted. as if that were a virtue. "The
date is set. and it will stay set. Do
all you men have to give up because
I won't marry somebody? Is that the
way your brilliant business is conduct
ed? I won't be a part of a bargain.
You urge me not to marry Bert be
cause you decide I don't love him,
and you urge me to marry a man who
can bring your stock to par. Father,
you're scared. Cau't you think of any
way out of your fluctuation but having
me many Sledge?"
"He loves you," he told her with
conviction. "Sledge never gives up. 1
"That's way ne wins, - sue asserrea.
"He tries everything. Why don't you?
Why don't you announce that the new
company is illegal and that it will be
fought in the courts? Have the news
paper say it can't build Its lines; then
the price of your stock will *go up
again. Why don't you trade some of
your stock for stock In the new com
pany? Why don't you threaten to stop
all your cars until the mayor or some
body makes the new company build Its
lines away from your street? The
new company couldn't have ears run
ning for six months, and there'd be
a riot unless the authorities did what
you wanted them to do. Why don't you
go down and shoot Sledge or hire it
done? He would! In fact, he'd have
done it by this time, I know. Why
don t you go to the men who are get
ting up this company and see what
you can find out? Then you can begin
some planning. I wish I were a man!"
Frank Marley sat staring at her. She
was standing, tail, straight und with
flushed cheeks, her eyes shining. He
passed his hand over his brow.
"No wonder Sledge wants to marry
you!" he involuntarily complimented
her. "You'd make a great team!"
She laughed and relented.
* 1 don't intend to be mean, but you
drive me to it," she said and kissed
him and patted him on (lie head. "Go
down to these people and sec what
you can find out," she counseled.
"I think I will," he concluded, with
a drowning man's desperation. "Mol
ly, you're a gritty one."
*♦*••**
Mr. Bozzam, in the privacy of hin
own apartments, reflectively broke the
ashes from his cigar into his empty
highball glass.
"Is the big chief punctured, or is he
Just enjoying himself?" he speculated.
'It's my opinion that he's picked up
horseshoe nails with all four Lies,"
declared fat little Timbers, eying the
hated collar which he never put on
until just before he went out "The
big chief bas wriggled his way
through the broken glass for so many
years that he has thought himself im
mune. But his pneumatics are flat
this time They've got him."
"I don't know." considered Bozzam.
They hare to bring him to trial yet,
and for a man who controls the sacred
judiciary it's a long way between an
Indictment and a hair cut"
They'll haug him," avowed Timbers.
"The people of this town have been
afraid of him so long that the first
time they catch him out without his
big stick every man Jn the county
will be fighting to get on the jury
which pronounces him guilty."
Mr. Moodson folded the other thumb
on top.
"Possibly you've rfgtt.*' assented
Bozzam, noting the capitalist's sign of
extreme agitation. "When we first
started In on this game I was afraid
to think with my head under the cov
ers. for fear he'd find it out and dec
orate me with a hall and chain, hut
now that they've got him on the run I
think It's the psychological moment to
hand him the double cross."
"Encore!" applauded Timbers. "He
has It coming to him for reducing us
to the pay of day laborers. It gives
me the heaves to think of pulling off a
quarter of n million burglary and only
wnlklng away with fifty thousand of
the velvet"
"It wasn't safe to let ourselves wish
we ought to have any more," explained
Bozzam. "I know how we could slip
our friend Sledge the twin X's. but
the trouble is nobody owns the majori
ty of the stock in the company which
is to be milked."
Let me do some guessing for you,"
