SHIFTING GAINS
IN THE GREAT
VERDUN BATTLE
Small Successes by Either Side m
Ten Days
THE OFFICIAL STATEMENTS
Of French and British Give Mea
gre News Turkish Success in
Mesopotamia Italians Report
Artillery Fighting.
London, England The strug
gle continues before Verdun,
with little shifts here, and there
when one side launches an at
tack with infantry and takes a
strip of ground. But the past
week, has seen no gain on either
side of appreciable extent.
The French official statement
Tuesday morning says the French
first line trenches in the Verdun
region west of the Meuso, from
Dead Man's hill to Cumieres,
were bombarded Monday by the
, Germans. There was some furth
er bombardment there that night.
East of the river relative : jcalm
prevailed during the night.
", Monday afternoon the attack
between Douaumont and the
Mouse was very violent. The
German forces included troops
from five different divisions. They
were repulsed.
East of the Chauffeur salient
the Germans penetrated a front
line trench but were partly eject
ed. The British war office Tuesday
morning gave out a statement
which said the British lines on
the south bank of the Tigris in
Mesopotamia had been forced
back by the Turks for a distance
c in some places of 500 to 800 yards
On the British front in France
the war office says there was re
cently some heavy shelling about
Voormezeole and Dickebusch and
also of the area between St. Elpi
and Ypres Comines canal. , There
was artillery activity on both
sides about Ilebuterne, between
Carnoy and the river Somme, and
also about Souchez and Noeux
les Mines. There has been min
ing activity in the Hohenzollern
sector, the Double Crassier and
west of Vimy. The report also
tells of aerial activity and states
that "One of our machines is
missing."
; The Italian official statement
tells of artillery fighting from
Giudiria to the Sugana valley and
on a portion of theAustro-Ttalian
front from the upper Dogano to
the upper But. The Italian? took
260 Austrians Prisoners in the Su
gana valley. Little, activity is re
ported on the Isonzo and Carso
fronts.
AMERICANS IN MEXICO
Pershing Prepare Afainst Strug-,
gle by bringing His men
Together
El Prso, Texns Reports ro
eeived fvAm Mexican sources are
to the effect that the American
advance detachments had been re
called by Gen. J. J. Pershing and
that the expeditionary force was
being concentrated in three plac
es, a strong detachment being en
camped near Satevo. the main
column near Namiquipa and a
third division at Colonia Dublan.
These reports also stated that
the Parral incident had a most
unfortunate effect on the people
of northern Mexico- and harl
greatly inflamed the anti-American
feeling. The Parral incident,
it was said, had been magnified by
anti-American and anti-Carranza
no'tators into a great battle in
which the Americans were badly
beaten. The Mexican dead wore
accounted for as unarmed citi
zens who had been killed bv the
Americans before the Parral gar
rison coiild interfere.
The excitement of the people
had been very much increased,
aecording to the same reports, by
their knowledge that , Villa, dead
or alive, had never gone as far
south as Parral and their conse
quent inability to understand
why the American cavalrymen
were in that district except on
the asumption that they 'were
really invading Mexico.
. The misery of the peons, rav
aged by disease and facing starv
ation, is makinsr it more difficult
than ever for the authorities to
keep them in control, it is said.
The failure of the Mexican of
ficials here and in Juarez to ob
tain any confirmation in two days
of the reported discovery of the
body of Villa has almost exting
uished hopes here of the report
being true. While neither Con
sul Garcia nor General Gavira arc
willing to abandon hope other
Mexicans usually well informed,
have gone over to the pessimists.
The situation of the American
troops and fears of another inci
dent such as that at Parral have
completely overshadowed the
pursuit of the bandit. The one
question of interest here is wheth
er the American troops are to be
recalled. ..
CONTRACT LET
For Asphalt Paving- on Taylor
street and Marian Avenue
The contract for asphalt paving
on Taylor street and Marian ave
nue has been awarded to the
Cornwall Construction Company,
who also have the contract for
putting in the curbing and storm
sewers. Consequently, the im
provement of the streets of this
city will in nowise be affected
by any injunction proceedings
brought against the road work in
the Punta Gorda special road and
Bridge District.
Importation of California Citrus
'Fruits Into Florida Prohibited ,
Gainesville Owing to the prev
alence, in California of the disease
known as the brown rot of lemons
and oranges, the State Plant
Board of Florida, at its meeting
at Gainesvile on the 10th instant,
adopted the folio wjryr' rule:
"The shipment, transportation
or' carrying of any and all citrus
fruits either by common carriers,
dining or buffet cars, railway
news companies, or individuals,
into the State of Florida from the
State of California, is hereby pro
hibited on account of the preva
lence m that State of the disease
known as the Brown Rot of lem
ons and oranges (Pythiacystis
citrophora.) "
Considerable alarm is felt by
the growers of.- citrus fruit in
Florida regarding the increasing
destructiveness af brown rot in
California, and k is realized that
the introduction and establish
ment of this disease in Florida
would cost the fruit industry of
the State hundreds of thousands
of dollars. ' '
This timely action on the part
of the Plant Board M ill doubtless
meet with the approval of all who
realize the importance of the cit
rus growing industry in this
State.
A Square Deal for the Horse
XThc European war and the au
tomobile have played havoc with
the horse, according to the horse
men who assembled recently at
the Hotel McAlpin, New York
City, to discuss ways and means
for their protection in the' future.
The occasion was the meeting of
the executive committee, of the
New York State Association of
Horsemen.
The sense of the gathering was
that the horse has as much right
to the highways as the speeding
automobile, and the organization
is going to do all in its power to
interest children, farmers and
business men throughout New
York State in the conservation of
the horse.
William D. Hunt, of Brookline,
Mass., treasurer of the Massachu
setts Protective Association for
Horses, pointed out that "the
value of horses in this country is
still three times greater than that
of automobiles."
"If all horses died today,"
said Mr. Hunt, ."we would all
starve to death, nrincinallv be
cause we depend on the horse for
Lwhat we wear and what wo oat.
Horses are no longer considered
when a group of men get together
to project the building of a new
road. Nowadays, when a horse
slips on the wet asphalt road, of-
rciais simply laugh at him. In
Massachusetts we are determined
to give the horse a square deal."
Punishing Villa is much like
cooking the traditional rabbit.
FARM AND GROVE IN FLORIDA
Agricultural News Service Urjverslty of Florida
College of Agriculture
Bluestone Helps Control Dieback
If conditions are favorable to
dieback it is apt to show in the
citrus grove during early summer.
B .F. Floyd, plant physiologist to
the University of Florida Experi
ment Station, suggests that grov
es affected with the disease be
treated at once to prevent further
development. Perhaps the most
dieback has been caused by im
proper treatment of the trees, the
use of wrong fertilizers, excessive
fertilization or excessive .cultiva
tion. However, other factors
such as lack of drainage are im
portant in the development of the
disease.
The best method of control is
to determine and prevent the cas
ual or influential factors in de
velopment. These may not be
evident in all cases. .Bluestone
has been used rather widely in
the state in treatment of dieback.
It has been used in the form of
bordeaux spray, or placed around
the tree in the manner of a fertili
zer, or placed beneath the bark in
crystalline form. .The latter
method is by far the least desir
able and is of questionable value.
The work of J. G. Grosscnbach
er, formerly with the United
States Department of Agriculture
has confirmed the practice of
placing bluestone in the soil. lie
tound that heavy applications
were more effective than light,
but the grower should be very
careful not to use excessive a
mounts. The. amount that would
be excessive varies with condi
tions. Mr. Grosseubacher uses as
much as 12 pounds in some cases
on large trees and noted no ill in
fects, but half that much may in
jure the trees under different con
ditions. "
Since bluestone is a strong
poison, Mr. rloyd advises its use
as a bordeaux spray. The only
objection to this form is that it
kills the friendly fungi which
helps to control purple scales.
But if the grower sprays syste
matically for scales and white fly
the use of bordeaux will not lead
to injury by these insects.
1 A 3 :3 :50 bordeaux spray in
April followed by another in June
may save a crop that ( might be
lost or seriously injured.' From
results obtained by the Station in
grove experiments it is evident
that the effects of J,his treatment
are lasting, because no dieback
has remained exception unspray
ed trees. A close watch should
be kept for purple scale after the
bordeaux spraying. If it appears
apply, oil emulsions.
Bankers will Push Pig Club
Every bank in the state has
been asked to foster the pig clubs.
The State Bankers' Association
met in Daytona April 7 and 8 and
recommended that the banks in
each county advance money at 6
per cent, to pig club boys. Of
course the money must be used to
buy purebred pigs and the 'pigs
must be raised according to pig
club rules.
G. L. Ilethcrington, boys' club
agent for the University of Flori
da Extension Division, submitted
a form of agreement between boys
and bankers. This form was ap
proved by the association. This is
the first action taken by bankers
to make the pig club movement
state wide, the banks oi several
counties have agreed to advance
money for pigs. It is probable
that most of the banks m every
county will see fit to lend the
money now that the association
has acted.
Watch for Melon Aphis
The melon aphis is one of the
camp followers of the melon crop.
It can usually be depended on. It
is feeding on citrus now because
the melons are not ready. It will
soon migrate to watermelons, can
taloupes, cucumbers and any oth
er member of the melon family
that happens to be convenient.
J. R .Watson, entomologist to
the University of Florida Experi
ment Station, suggests that any
one who has melons near a citrus
grove will do well to spray for
the aphis on the trees. They are
especially fond of water sprouts
and new growth. The water
sprouts may be pruned out and
burned. The valuablo new growth
should be sprayed with tobacco
solution.
The following formula is rec
ommended by Mr. Watson : Dis
solve whale oil or other caustic
soap in five gallons of water. Soft
water requires two or three
pounds of soap. Hard water Re
quires more soap according to the
degree of hardness. Add one
fourth of a pint of Black-leaf 40
and boil five minutes. Dilute, to
50 gallons with water.
Thrips Prey on Strawberries and
Tomatoes f
Did you ever notice any little
hard brown fruits among the
strawberries? Some have failed
to develope and some have a
whole side that failed 'to fill out.
This injury was caused during
the blooming period. The cause
was the versatile flower thrips. It
is not at all particular about its
host and consequently works on a
variety of plants.
Just now it is paying attention
to the strawebrry and has been
for several weeks. It will also
be in the tomato bloom before
long and will cause considerable
injury if the weather continues
dry and warm.
J. R. Watson, entomologist to
the University of Florida Experi
ment Station, recommends spray
ing to control this insect. Tobac
co extract is perhaps the best ma
terial. If Black leaf 40 is used,
mix at the rate of two-thirds of a
pint to 100 gallons of water. Five
quarts of commercial lime sul
phur added to eaqh 100 gallons of
this mixture will kill any red
spiders present. -.-
Get Ready for Whitefly
The adult whitefly is on the
wing. It will not be long, there
fore, until -spraying time. J. R.
Watson, entomologist to the Uni
versity of Florida Experiment
Station urges every citrus grow
er to prepare for spraying. The
season has been dry and conse
quently fungi are scarce.' It is
probable that there will be a big
crop of whitefly. If control is ef
fected it must be done with
sprays.
The importance of controlling
this insect can hardly be overesti
mated. It is useless to take pre
cautions against other enemies
and then let the whitefly have
free reign. It will not only
shorten the crop, but it will make
the fruits smaller. By furnishing
a medium for the sooty mold it is
responsible for dirty and staned
fruits which must grade low. The
sooty mold also shades the leaves
-1.1 I 1 . 1 . m . . i
ana inus aiminisnes growth or the
whole tree.
Paraffon oil, soap and other ma
terials should be on hand. Spray
ing machines should be put in
shape. Wait ten days after the
adults disappear to give time for
the newest eggs to hatch, and
then spray. Oranges and grape
fruit should be sprayed when
they are about the size of a wal
nut. Preparation should be made
to spray chinaberry and privit
hedges if there is any objection to
cutting them down, Both these
plants are hosts to the whitefly
and unless they are sprayed they
will furnish enough insects to in
fest the whole state.
Do Roaches Bother You?
There are numerous roach rem
edies. Sometimes it takes all the
family and all the remedies to
keep the roaches put of the house.
The best way to combat them iz
to leave no attractive midnight
lunches where they can obtain
them. Then use all the other
means at hand. Destroy all the
egg cases that can be found.
These are usually attached to
furniture, woodwork, in closets,
in corners and other sheltered
places. ,
Borax or calcium fluoride
sprinkled in the runs or around
places they frequent will dispatch
some of them. It is not probable
that they eat these substances in
tentionally. The theory advanc
ed by J. It. Watson, entomologist
to the University of Florida Ex-'
periment Station, is that they
walk over the powder, which irri-1
tates their teet. lhey are sup
posed to lick them for relief and
in that way obtain the poison. At
any rate a number of dead roach
es will be found after one of these
substances has been put out
This time Russia seems to have
a real iron horseshoe concealed in
its boxing glove.
FIVE DAYS OF FESTIVITY
Wauchula to Have a Great Time
Next Week
Wauchula is to have five days
of festivity with an aviation meet
beginning on Tuesday, April 25,
and running through Sat. Apl. 29,
the. star attraction of which will
be Jonnie Green,well known avia
tor. who will make a series of
flights during the carnival period
Mr. Green has been stationed at
St. Petersburg the past winter,
making flights across Tampa Bay,
from time to time, carrying pass
ensrers and important mail, in
which flights he used a hydro
plane. He will use a Curtiss pas
sene-er carrying bi-plane in his
flights at Wauchula and several
citizens of the town are said to be
nursing their nerve with a view
of going "up in the air," if the
aviator permits.
The big day of the week will be
Candidates' Day, which is set for
Friday, April .28, Invitations
have been extended every politi
cal candidate in DeSoto county to
be present and make an address.
A perfect deluge of political ora
tory is promised during the day.
The aviation meet will be in
augurated on Tuesday of next
week with a civic parade, the fea
ture of which will pc a large mov
ing human flag formed by school
children dressed in the national
colors who are to march in the
parade.
t An auto floral parade will be
another attraction of similar de
scription.
The principal streets of Wau
chula have recently been paved
with brick and street masquerade
dances will be given on them two
evenings during the week I uos
day and Saturday which events
are arousing great interest a
mong the young people. Num
erous other attractions are being
planned and Wauchula expects
to have the gayest, time m its his
tory.
America's Young Men

Accordbig to figures made pub
lie by the war department, during
the first five days after President
Wilson's authorization of a 20,
000 army increase, 2,42G applica
tions were received. Of these on
ly 555 were accepted. The rea
son why such a large proportion
of the young men offering them
selves for military service failed
to pass the physical tests calls for
investigation.
True Sympathy for the North
It was the wise little daughter
of a well known Acline trucker
who listened gravely to the ac
count of the last bad snow storm
in the North. When she could
stand it no longer she ran to a
neighbor exclaiming,
"Oh Mrs. B., they've had four
inches of snow up North and all
the peach bugs are killed;" then
as an after thought came swiftly,
"and a good thing I should say
it was."
The Colege Ideal
"The ideal of the college stud
ent should be total abstinence, "
says Dr. Jacob G. Schurman,
president of Cornell University.
"Total abstinence is what we
ought to have among our stud
ents. No railroad, no industrial
concern today will take a student
graduate from Cornell University
unless it has my assurance that he
is a total abstainer."
