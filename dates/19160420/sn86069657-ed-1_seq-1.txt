To Thd Rcideiwof The Times :
As a member' Of the County Board of
Education I, wish to call your atten
tion to the act that the Editor of Bet
ter Farms and Roads says that ho Is
going to writt a, while, at least, about
tho schools of the county.
Uince thelEditor of that paper insists
that the sctjbols thirty years ago were
better nod hat. wp had better touchers
in the cO'Uiitr 'then than now and that
he disapproves of the long term schools
and pesent fjs torn and Is so opposed
to and out of Sympathy with them that
he absolutely. refuses to patronize them
and .does jwV even, Lermlt his own
ohlldreh toRttefid tho' pnblio schools
arc inieregrea -in no scaoois rvi
countv'-sliould be forewarned not to
'expect anything favorable towards our
schools to appear iu tho columns of
that paper.
For instance, in the year 1911-1012,
the County Board of Education receiv
ed 78.O0, only three out of tho 120
paying a smaller sum,- and these three
counties paid much more to their oth
er trustees while. Powell paid nothing.
In. the year 1012-1013, tho Board re
$165.00 for services, part of which were
rendered during 1911-1912. Now, botii
of these amounts appear in the same
book, one on page 01, and the other on
page 197, and, just think! we have ono
iu our midst-e philanthropic as tiVcull
attention to. tho latter and criticize
the Board for that without even men
tioning the excellent showing the pre
vious year. And yet, this is the same
party who displays such headlines
when referring to others as "Deal
Honestly''' and ''For Tho Sake of Fair
ness." Tho entire amount of school taxes
collected bv our Sheriff accordinff to
his settlements recorded in tho Clerk's
office for the three years ending 1915,
is as follows :
1018, 12,375.45.
1014, 2,784.31,
1015, 2,712.64.
Tho; levy as fixed by our Fiscal Court
for school purposes for each of these
throe years was 20o. on each 100.00
and 1.C0 poll tax. The above amounts
represent tho entire amount or money
derived from this levy. This ia nut an
estimate, nor what It looks like it
ought to bo, but Just what it produced
upon the present levy.
