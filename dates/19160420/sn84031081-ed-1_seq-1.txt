Washington, April 19. President
Wilson's long expected final warning
Id Germany that the United States
will break off diplomatic relations un
less she abandons her present meth
ods of submarine warfare and Imme
diately declares her intention to do
to, was delivered today in a teSto to
JSerlln, and also was announced by
the president In an address to a Joint
session of congress.
The president considers that the
next step depends solely upon Ger
many and that three or four days con
stitute a reasonable time for a reply.
Diplomatic history records but one
Instance as yet where a breaking of
relations between two first class
powers has not eventually brought
war thut which now exists between
Germany and Italy.
Congress received the president's
declaration of his course with mixed
evidences of concern .and approba
, tion. Won of tho-TBadfa, d . rnc rat
and republican, thought thp president
hardly could do less, and some ex
pressed the opinion that his action
would not lead to war. Republican
Leader ,Munn alone, of all the oppo
sition leaders, openly attacked the
president for his stand. He charac
terized It as a political pjay.
Kvldcncc Iwputuble.
In short, the United States presents
the evidence as the capstone to an
accumulation of evidence extending
over a period of months which is
held to prove Irrefutably that CSer
maay's assurances to the United
States repeatedly have been wanton
ly violated.
Copies of the American note were
sent to representatives- here of neu
tral nations on the assumption that
they are as much interested as the
United States in the protection of
neutral rights. The document was
nut given to any of the belligerent
diplomats, a the controversy Is re
tarded u being solely between the
L'nited st men and Germany.
Germany Will Not Yield.
Count von Bemstorft already has
reiterated to Secretary Lansing that
under no circumstances will Germany
live up the submarine as a weapon
of warfare, because, she contends, it
Ik a retaliation for Great Britain's
food blockade. The ambassador has
declared, however, that his govern
ment will attempt to bring subma
rine operations within the law of
nations. This the United States is
willing to discuss after Germany has
abnpdoned her present methods not
before.
Against that possibility stands the
declaration in the American note that
the United States has considered from
Hie tirst that the employment of sub
marines for destruction of commerce
ls by its very nature "utterly in
compatible with the principles of hu
manity, the long established and in
controvertible rights of neutrals and
the sacred immunities or noncom
batar.ts." Waiting; SlMfto Short.
The crisis now resolves itself into
'he waiting stage, during which Ger
many will have-opportunity to accede
t0 the American demands. Before
another week begins, settlement of
ne long standing Issue either will be
assured or Count von Bernstorff
protanly wm have his passports and
Ambassador Gerard will be leaving
I'-crlin.

night, and what he purposed to say
to congress today.
How Conference lliids.
When the president fiuished rend
ing, he looked up and seeing Sena
tor Stone's grave face, said: "You
look an sad as I feel."
The chairman's response was to In
quire of the president if he had told
them all he ahd to say. The con
ference thus ended.
The word of the president's plan
spread uickly throughout congress
and when he look bis place at the
clerk's desk in the hall of the house, i
promptly at 1 o'clock, he was con
fronted by fin assembly of gravely
quiet senators and representatives
who hung Intently upon every word
he uttered and cheered him heartily
when he had finished-
Asks Nothing of Congress.
The president asked nothing of
conRress; he came only to inform it
of his action. He did U m fifteen
minutes and congress went back to
work, solemnly impressed with the
situation which confronts the coun
try. The scene had been dramati
cally human. The president's de
meanor reflected his state of mind
and an impartial observer readily
would say the demeanor of congress
as a whole reflected its sympathy.
The first actually crucial moment
toward which the relations of the
United States and Germany have
been steadily drifting for nearly a
year, had come and been passed and
the president had returned to the
White House to await the' next one
America awaits the action of Mer
lin. The Address in Full.
The president said:
"Gentlemen of the congress:
"A situation has arisen In the for
eign relations of the country, of
which it is my plain duty to inform
you very frankly.
"It will be recalled that In Feb
ruary, 1915, the Imperial German
government announced Its Intention
to treat the waters surrounding Great
Britain and Ireland as embraced
within the seat of war, and to de
stroy all merchant ships owned by
Its enemies that might lie found with
in any part of that portion of the
high seas and that it warned all ves
sels of neutral as well as of belliger
ent ownership, to keep out of the
waters it had thus prescribed or else
enter them at their peril- t
"The government of the l.nlteo
1 nll U
States earnestly protested, u ioo
the position that such a policy could
not be pursued without tne practical
certainty of gross and palpable vio-
latlon of the law of nation, partteu-
it uiihmnt-inA craft were to be
...i.
employed as its instrument, Inasmuch
as the rules prescribed by that law,
rules founded on principles of hu
manity and established for the pro
tection of the lives of non-combatants
at sea, could not in the nature
of the case, I observed by such
vessels- It based its protest on the
ground that persons of neutral na
tionality and vessels of neutral own
ership would be exposed to extreme
and intolerable risks, and that no
right to close any part of the high
seas against their use or to expose
them to such risks could lawfully be
asserted by any belligerent govern
ment. law llascd on Humanity.
"The law of nations in these mat
ters, upon which the government of
the United States bused its protest, is
not of recent origin, or founded upon
merely arbitrary principles set up by
convention. It is based, on the con
trary, upon manifest and imperative
principles of humanity and has long
been established with the approval
and by the express assent of all civil
ized nations.
"Notwithstanding the earnest pro
test of our government, the imperial
German government at once proceed
ed to carry out the policy it had an
nounced. It expressed the hope that
th dancers Involved, at any rate the
dangers to neutral vessels, woyld be
reduced to a minimum by the in
structions which it had issued to its
submarine commanders and assured
the government of the United States
thut it would take every possible pre
caution both to respect the rights of
neutrals, and to safeguard the lives
of non-combatants-
What has actually happened in the
year which has since elapsed, has
shown that those hopes were not Jus
tified, those assurances insusceptible
of being fulfilled. In pursunnce of
the policy of submarine warfare
against the commerce of its adver
saries, thus announced and entered
upon by the Imperial German gov-
eriiment n spite of the solemn pro
test of tins government, 11k ooiii

along with vessels of belligerent own
ership in constantly Increasing num
bers'. Sometimes the merchantman
attacked has been warned and sum
moned to surrender, before being fir
ed on or torpedoed; sometimes pas
sengers or crew have been vouch
safed the poor security of being al

again and again no warning had been

boats allowed to those on board.

Ives G. Lelevler, consul of the. do

today that General Arnulfo Gomez 1b
still in Colonia Morelos and has no in
tention of moving for the present. iHe
denied authoritatively that Gomez has
received any orders from General Al
varado Obregon, de facto secretary of
wac, to advance into Chihuahua. Such
orders have been expected for nearly
two weeks, and their continued ab
sences Is puzzling to the Mexican mili
tia. General P. Kllas Calles, military
governor of Sonora, left Agua Prleta
secretly last night for Fronteias,
twenty-nine miles south, for a stay of
indefinite length.
General Calles sent word to Con
sul Lelevler today, however, that he
wished to rest and recuperate for a
few days. While In Fronteraa he will
see no one. The consul explained that
hundreds of callers had been re
ceived at his headquarters during his
recent illness. The excitement and
constant worry served to aggravate
the nervousness of the patient.
It wag definitely learned today that
General Calles came to the border on
orders from General Obregon to re
main in close touch with American
affairs during the present crisis in
the relations between the two govern
ments. Calles explained this to several per
sons in connection with his sickness.
He had been ordered to the border
and could not leave until the order
was countermanded, he said. Arrivals
today report that a new disease, the
nature of which has not been deter
mined, but which is believed to be
typhus, has broken out in the south
em part of the Moctezuma district of
Sonora, There have been a number
of deaths In Moctezuma and the vicin
ity of Cumpns.
Th disease, whether or not It Is
typhus, lit ml dto be proving very con
tagious, few patients recovering and
death generally ensues a few hours
after the sHkness begins.

London, April 19 (10:32 p. m.).
After the ministerial conferences this
evening a more hopeful feeling that
tho break-up of the government will
he avoided prevailed in the parlia
mentary lobbies. It was based on
nothing tangible, however, and the
general opinion among the public ow

of Premier Asc,iilth's statement in the
house of commons, is that the life of
the ministry hangs by a thread.
