AWAIT WORD
WITH GRAVE
HPKIANCY
No Time Limit Fixed, but
President Believes Two or
.Three days are Enough.
GERARD RECEIVED
NOTE LAST NIGHT
Lansing Would Make No
Announcement of This
Morning's Conference.
Washington, April 20.—
The United States govern
ment, having said its last
word to Germany in the sub
marine controversy, turned
with grave expectancy to
Berlin, where rests the deci
sion as to whether the imper
ial government shall aban
don its present methods of
submarine warfare or break
with Washington.
President Wilson probably
will wait until the end of the
week for Germany to reply
to hi«- -wtua^~
•which declares.the intentions
ofthe United States to sever
dlpiomiliitr^relatrcms unless
the Berlin government "im
mediately" gives up the use
of submarines against com
merce and squares her sub
marine policy with the prin
ciples of humanity and inter
national law.
While no time limit is set
in the communication, the
president is known to hold
the opinion that three or four
days would be a reasonable
period to allow Germany to
form a decision.
Confers with Lapwing.
Washington, April 80.—Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador,
went to the state department for a
conference with Secretary Lansing on
the submarine warfare situation, and
qlso to.discuss the arrest in New York
of Wolfe von Igel, secretary of the
former German military'attache, Cap
tain von Fapen.
Lansing and Bernstorff were in con
ference fully twenty minutes. After
the ambassador had left Lansing
would .make no statement regarding
the discussion which took place.
After the conference it was learned
that German diplomats regard the
receipt of the reply from Germany
within two or three days as- physically
impossible. It is thought the reply
could not be received here before ten
days.
Note Reaches Berlin.
Berlin, April 20.—The American
note to Germany arrived in Berlin late
yesterday evening'. Ambassador Ger
ard probably Will present it to the
foreign office early this afternoon.

San Antonio, Tex., April 20 The early withdrawal of the troops
sent Into Mexico as a punitive exped Itloii or the authorization of mili
tary operations on a big scale must lx» the result of Major General
Hugh ij. Scott's Investigation of the situation, in the opinion of army
officers here.
General Fnnston and his staff are ready to show Scott all the
written records of the failure to catch Villa, and are prepared to place
him in touch with unwritten evidence.
PERSHING IS NOT PUSHING CAMPAIGN.
General Pershing is not pushing liis campaign against Villa and
will not. until he gets from headquarters authority and facilities to
operate more freely.
Officers here believe the facts in the case, showing the futility of
extending the operations along the existing lines, will convince Scott
of the hopelessness of a further pursuit unless the commanding officer
in Mexico is given more effective backing.
Villa—If he Is yet alive—can be caught, officers here believe, bat
only by the adoption of a plan that the Mexicans generally and almost
certainly would characterize as war.
ARMED OPPOSITION FROM BOTH SIDES.
Villa has penetrated so far into Mexico that the hostility of Mexi
cans, both friends of Villa and of the Carransa government, haa became
so marked that army officers are convinced further operations most
be undertaken with the understanding that armed opposition by both
factions'-will be met.
The. troop movements ordered by General Punston are being car
ried out today, but probably none of the 2,800 additional men he
laqned to give Pershing will be further than Pershing's base at Colum
by the time General Soott arrives.
Pershing is holdlng intact hls l0,000 men stretched fnm Celum

El Paso. Tex.. April 20.—^-While the .American punitive expedition
is marking time In Its pursuit of Villa, efforts are being made to
strengthen army base* and lines of communication. Fears were ex
pressed by army offlciers that should an order come to withdraw "the
.American troops, Villa &nd other mauradlng bands will raise 'the cry
that, 'the American troops are. In retreat, with the result that the Amer
lean army will be' subjected to constant night attacks and sniping as
they retire from Mexico.
MOVE FORCES IN LARGE UNITS.
Tto prevent such warfare against, bis columns, General Pershing is
preparing to be in a position to move his forces In large units. If
necessary, Pershing may call upon some of the new troops that Gen
eral Funston has recently transferred to the army base at Columbus.
New Mexico.
The belief is general at Fort Bliss that, the United States troops
will encounter more dlfficidties in the withdrawal from Mexico than
they did on their rapid 400 mile drive from Columbus to Parral..
NO WORD FROM GENERAD GAVAZOS.
No word has come from General Gavasos. who with Colonel Car
raasa. Is reported to have gone to'San Francisco Borja, to bring back
the body of Villa. Officers of the Juarez garrison fear that Gavaaos
lias been led Into a trap and he and his commands ambushed.
A dispatch from Chihuahua today says that the Parral district la
quiet, and that Villa Is not dead, but' has passed far south into Du
ratigo. many miles from the nearest American column now resting at a
point near Patirwl.
