A SOLUTION.
It has been called to our atten
tinn the numerous times many
candidates for office always state
that they are in favor of good
roads. j
Jnow, in all these announce
monts they do not give any defi
natc plan whereby we may obtain
tnesc good roads. There is no
monoply in the want for good
roads and everyone is in favor of
them. Good roads are a neces
sity for the welfare and prosper
ity of a country town. They are
iudcspensible to the convenience
and prosperity of the man in the
country. Thjs prosperity has no
argument. Everybody knows we
should have them, but no one
suggests the means to obtain
.them.
One idea that appeals to the
Herald is: To organize the coun
ties into rood districts the same
as into drainage districts, bond
the road district and have roads
built by contract. The bonds
might run for say, ten or twenty
years at a low rate of interest,
and during this time we could be
using this superbly line road at
all seasons of the year. We un
derstand that the poll tax being
paid by each man is now $3.00
per year, and it Is put into mud
holes this season, and again next
season we have the same mud
hole to put that next $3.0(1 into.
atuieena oi twenty years we
still have those $3.00 mud holes
with us, having expended the
money for absolutely nothing.
During twenty years an indi
vidual's poll tax amounts to $60.-
00, and the sum total for Pemi
scot county for the twenty years
would be something like $150,-
000.00, which, instead of being
put into mud holes, put into good,
permanent roads of concrete or
other modern kind of road con
struction would build a ereat
many miles, Add to the amount
of the poll tax assessed the
amount of road tax collected on
property values for the twenty
years would make everlasting
tho best roads known to mankind,
over every mudtrail in this coun
ty, and construct as many more
as are required for the general
convenience of the public. With
such roads as this stupendous
sum could build, two mules could
at all seasons of the year pull to
market, or to some shipping
point as much as tho wagon
could carry.
Think of it! Twenty years in
which to pay, and the good roads
1 in use during all this time, No
J heavier taxes, and a whole lot
more convenient. Under ouf
1 present system(ir) or no system
at all, we pay in twenty years
just as much, and use these
i road&('f) advantageously a small
portion of the time. At certain
times of the year one can hardly
come to town horseback, much
lea,s with buggy. This is ex
pressly our idea, and if our
Iriends who are trying some
solution in road building can sug
gest a better one, wa will be glad
to devote his matter space. Let
us hear from them.

School gardening will be done
by rooms this year. Each room
beginning with number three,
has been allotted a plat of
ground. There will be consider
able rivalry, to see which room
can make the best garden. The
work for the most part will he
done outside school hours.
Pearl Chism who has missed
school several days on account of
poor health, was out of school
the" latter part of this week and
may have to discontinue her
studies for the remainder of the
term. We regret to lose Pearl
and sincerely hope her health
may improve ho much that she
can finish up her year's work.
