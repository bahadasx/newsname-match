THE COUNTY
BOND ISSUE
Our County Judge, John G. Aiher,
Preieoti Some Unanswerable
Arguments ia Bond Faror
On the question of road bonds
let us have a iittle heart to
heart talk. We find on this
Question as on all other vital
questions a diversity of opinion.
This is all right as everyone is
justly entitled to his or her opin-
ion. But a great many reasons'
are assigned for the bond9 and a
great manv against them, and in
many instances without a shadow
of argument therefor. First let
us consider the facta upon which
a bonded issue is based. In the
first place all our roads now to be
constructed or reconstructed by
state aid are under the supervision
of state authorities. And the
state offers and obligates itself
to pay one-half of the bond issue
that any county may authorize
for road and bridge construction
under state aid. Placing us in
this attitude relative to the pay
ment therefor, we pay one-half
and the state pays one-half. If
we as a people are desirous of
bettering our rond conditions,
and undertake to construct rock
roads under state supervision,
the state will lay down one dol
lar for eve-y one dollar that we
lay down for that purpose. Then
later we ar promised from the
Federal government a like sum,
U' ""and this sum comes ouf of the
postal department. So it is up
to us to inaugurate the spirit of
enterprise and vote the issual of
the bonds and take the benefit of
state and Federal aid. 'In this
way we can soon have good roads
and be reaping the benefit "of
them while we are paying for
them. The tax necesitated there
for cannot exceed the sum of, 20
cents on the hundred dollars
worth of taxable property, and
there can be no poll tax for road
purposes. So the tax at most
will not be very heavy. And the
use of the roads will more than
V pay anv man in each and every
year that he pays taxes. Some
people object to the bond issue
from the fact that they consider
It a debt created for future gen
erations to pay. In a sense this
istrue buj who would object to
that, when we are building roads
for future generations to use.
Still another objection is that it
will enhance the value of lands,
and will not increase their pro
ductive qualities. The first may
be true and I really believe that
it Is, the latter ia of course true,
for nothing will increase the pro
ductiveness of your lands other
.han something placed immed
lately thereon. But granting that
the marketable value of the land
is increased, who would object to
that? Some say, we do not want
to sell our lands, hence we would
be paying on something for which
we have never realized any mon
ey. Now this is an elusive ar
gument and of no value what
ever for this reason, if you go
out in the beginning of the year
to prepare for a large crop of to
bacco you do so from a monetary
consideration. You have no
' fSroffey at the beginning, but you
toil on through the heat of sum
. mer and finally succeed in pro
ducing a $1000 crop of tobacco.
You deduct tho expense of pro
duction and preparing for and
marketing, and you see what you
have left as an asset. Whatever
it may be it represents your in
creased possessions. Now is it
not a fact that it is easier for
you to create possessions in the
advance value of lands and other
property than to toil through the
heat of summer to do so, And it
is the first consideration of every
good, wise and thrifty farmer
to see to it well that everything
he owns is increasing in value
thereby adding to his already
accumulated holdings. Do you
think that your children will rise
up and denounce you for giving
them good roads and also a road
tax to pay? If you- are leaving
them a landed estate increased in
value by virtue of the roads, and
all by your enterprising spirit
voting upon yourself and them
the little increase in taxation.
No, but on the contrary they will
always praise their fathers for
their forethought and would say,
we would feel ashamed of them
should they have left us with the
expensive mud roads and forced
us to build good roads and get all
the benefit of them while they
are sleeping in their graves
Good roads are coming, one way
or the other. We may by our
votes refuse to build roads and
take advantage of State aid, but
other counties are going to and
are now taking advantage and it
is only a question of time until
we will have to whether we
want to or not.

EXPLANATION
OF TAXATION
By Congressman John E. Lamb In
The National Monthly Con
tributed by T. M. Dean.
Mr. S. M. Jenkins,
Dear Sir:
Since the "Bdhd Issue"
question has come up I find some
of the fellows opposed to it, be
cause of an existing prejudice
against taxation. There are
many fair minded men who wish
to pay for everything they get,
who feel that they get nothinz
in return for their "tax money."
I am sending you some ex
tracts from a piece written for
the "National Monthly" by Hon.
John E. Lamb, of Indiana, and
would be glad to have you pub
lish it some time, when you have
plenty of space, if you like the
sentiment of it.' Yours,
T. M. Dean,
Deanwood, Ky.
The Question of Taxation.
"There is no governmental
question of more vital concern to
the people than that of taxation.
It is as old as civilization and has
occupied the minds of statesmen
and rulers from the earliest re
corded time.
"It is but just that men who
are hedged about by the majes
ty of the law, protected in their
rights to life, liberty and pur
suits of happiness, through the
instrumentality of an organized
society, should be compelled to
pay for the privileges and bless
ings they enjoy.
"The man who has reached the
highest perfection of understand
ing and is capable of comprehend
ing the theory of civilization will
alwayi pay the full measure of
his taxes. without a murmur on
his lips.
"And why? Because the tax
you pay is the price you give for
the protection the government
casts around you. It places a
shield of protection between your
life and the hatred of your enem
ies. It protects ycu in' the per
formance of your daily duties,
and through a multiplicity of
laws, prevents the brigand of
the King's highway from carry
ing away the fruit of your honest
toil. - It builds schools and uni
versities, and places within easy
reach of your children an educa
tion, and thus prepares them for
the battles of maturity. It builds
penal institutions for the confine
ment of the criminals, and asy
lums and hospitals for those who
are unable to care for themsel
ves. And when at last you pnss
away it still stands as guardian
representing you in the distribu
tion of your property and lastly
places the sentinel of security at
your grave for the benefit of
loved ones left behind."
