[WHAT ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS
THINK OF WILSON'S NOTE
I General Opinion is That Dip
lomatic Break is Certain
and War is Possibility.
rBy Ed. L. Keen, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
LONDON, April 20.—Well informed
persons here do not believe that Ger
many will yield to the United States.
The general opinion in London is that
a diplomatic break is certain and that
war Is a strong possibility.
This view is based on the fact that
Germany has emphasized the state1
ment that the submarine is her most
effective weapon in figl*ting England.
For this reason it is believed that
Germany cannot afford to concede any
essential points, though it is thought
possible she will offer certain conces
sions to obtain some delay.
back down before the United States.
After the breach came, they, said the
German government would so order
its submarine policies that there
would be no danger of a war with
America.
"The significance of the statement."
said the Pall Mall Gazette this after
noon, "lies in the fact that President
Wilson is no longer able to withhold
official significance of the true Ameri
can policy. America may be congratu
lated upon the fact that she has
reached the point where she is no
longer compelled to wear the full
livery of official neutrality as between
man and beast."
"We don't exult over the prospect
of America's entrance into our war,"
said the Manchester Guardian, "but
we do exult in the prospect of a vic
tory of the ideals of law and humani
ty. Whether Germany yields or not,
this victory is sensibly nearer."
The Globe declares that the United
States is probably more useful to the
under present conditions than if
she entered the war.
The Westminster Gazette says that
President Wilson has mapped out a
line of action which admits no re
treat."

PARIS,- April *20.—The world's
greatest battle at Verdun, only 135
miles from the French capital, sud
denly took second place in public in
terest todav with the arrival of dis
patches representing President Wil
son's speech.
The president's strong stand won
instant and unanimous approval here.
That portion of his speech referring
to his fight to uphold the principles
of humanity was applauded as one of
the finest utterances heard in any
capital since the war began.
The text of the American note to
Germany had not been received here
early today though It was expected
to follow the lines laid ddwn in the
president's speech.
Fbr several days public sentiment
has been growing warmer toward
'America. French people were at
first disappointed by what they sup
posed to be America's indifference
over the first submarine outrages.
The masses are now b«ginning to

prisoners and much booty. Other

around Verdun last night. On the
west bank of the Meuse, there was

RUSSIANS ON FRONT.
PARIS, April 20.—General Joffre
today addressed an army order of the
day sending best wishes to the FNts
slan troops sent to France to fight
on the Occidental front.
[This is the first intimation that
any Russian troops are fighting on
the Occidental front.
It is not clear whether the expres
sion" Occidental front" in the Paris
dispatch refers to the western front
from Flanders to Alsace, or to the
operations at Salonika. In either
event, if the interpretation that Rus
sian troops have been transported to
aid the French is correct, that fact
may be of the greatest significance
in view of the recent French com
plaints that England has not sent
enough troops to the continent.
Russian troops could only be trans
ported to France by a long journey
from Alexandrovks, on the White
sea, since the port of Archangle is not
yet open. The transports would have
to encounter danger from German
submarine attacks. Early In the war
there were rumors that large bodies
of Russian troops had passed through
England enroute to France, but these
reports were later proven untrue.]
PICKED FOR BRAVERY.
PARIS, April 20.—.Well known Rus
sian officers, General Joffre stated in
the order of the day, are In command

troops to France, he stated, as further
proof of her devotion to the French

In the War.
PARIS, April 20.—Russian
troops were landed at the
French port of Marseilles to
day to join the allied troops in
operations against the Ger
mans on the continent.
fS,
This sensational announcement was
made simultaneous with publication
of an army order of the day issued
by Genera! Joffre sending best wishes
to the first detachment of soldiers of
the czar to fight op French soil since
the beginning of the war.
The censor thus far has permitted
no details as to numbers to be pub

pers assume that the Russians
were landed In large forces. They as
sume also that they will be rushed
Into action either at Verdun or on
some other sector of the western
front where the allies may be con
templating a great offensive.
By what route the Russians reached
Marseilles Is known only to officials
of the war Office and ministry of ma
rine. It Is assumed, however, that
their transportation to France was
decided on at the recent general con
ference of the allies in Paris.
No 'news In many weeks has so
electrified the French capital as the
brief bulletins passed by the censor
this afternoon. Newspapers contain

lines, were eagerly grabbed up In the
boulevards and crowds beseiged the
newspaper offices for more news.

Preparing to present the entire ex

which caused the recall of the ad

Meantime the lull in the expedi

Pershing to the war department. This
report, detailing instances of hostil

portion revealing an attack on the
detachment commanded by Major
Howze near Bachineva, when citizens
attacked from the rear.
The troops had passed through
Bachineva, Pershing's report stated,
when the onslaught began. Funston
made no mention of the consequence*
of the fight, but stated Howze was
unable to punish the offenders, owing
to the conditions governing the expe
