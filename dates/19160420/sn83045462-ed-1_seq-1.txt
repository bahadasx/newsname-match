Count von Bernstorff Holds
Conference With Secretary
of State Lansing.
HOPE IS NOT ABANDONED
GERMANY WILL GIVE IN
Ambassador Said to Have Recommended
General Modification of
Submarine Warfare.
SPECULATION AS TO FUTURE
Views as to Steps Which Would Follow
an Unsatisfactory Response
From the German Government.
Count von Rern?torff. the German
ambassador, went to the
Stat? Department today and conferred
with Secretary Lansing:
01 the submarine warfare situ:iri
in and also to discuss the arr.-t
in New York of Wolfe >on
'gel. secretarv of former Germm
ili-litary Attache von Papen.
Secretary Lansing and the German
ambassador were in conf?."encc
fully twenty minutes. After
the ambassador had left the Secretary
of State would make no
statement regarding the discussion
which took place.
Ten Days for Reply.
After the conference it was learned
that German diplomats regard the receipt
of a reply from Germany within
two or three days as physically impossible.
It was thought a reply could
not be received here before ten days.
It was pointed out that Easter Monday
is a holiday in Germany and that necessary
consultations of officials would
rause almost another week to elapse
before the German decision could be
transmitted here.
Ambassador Bernstorff refused to
z
discuss his conversation with Secretary
Lansing, but indicated his call was not
prompted by the arrival of instructions
from his government.
Chances as to Outcome.
TTegsrriing the hope held by German
officials here for an amicable settlement,
one official described the prospect
as a "toss-up."
Secretary Lansing explained in detail
to the German ambassador the position
of the United States, and is understood
to have expressed the sincere
hope that the attitude of the German
government would be so adjusted as to
meet the position taken by the United
t??t
The ambassador was understood to
have informed the Secretary of the details
of a message he sent yesterday to
his government, making certain recommendations
which, he believed, if acceptable
to his government, would be
satisfactory to the United States.
Has a Confidential Message.
In addition the ambassador informed
the Secretary of a message of a highly
confidential nature he had received
from Berlin.
I-ast night Count von Bernstorff appeared
hopeful that some would
be found to prevent a break of relations.
His manner today indicated
that he was not so sanguine.
After returning to the embassy. Count
von Bernstorff prepared a long dispatch.
which probably will be sent to
his government before night.
The .-imbassador was authoritatively
represented as having sought the Secretary's
views in regard to a tentative
proposal that Germany issue immediately
a declaration covering all submarine
operations similar to that issued
on January 7 for the operations
in the Mediterranean. How the suggestion
was received was pot divulged,
bur the general belief is that no step
will be considered until some direct
response from Berlin has been received
by the Secretary of State.
Urges Immediate Action.
\mbassador BernstorlT was understood
10 have been impressed with the
necessity of prompt action by Germany.
In his message yesterday to
herlin the ambassador urged that
something be done immediately.
No appointment for another confer
e i? e with Secretary l^insing has been
i! rde by the ambassador, and it is beed
he will not call again until the
G r r.an government had acted upon or
r: least replied to the American deads.
While declining to discuss the
s i at ion. the ambassador clearly in
oated he considered it hazardous to
indulge in speculation. He neither left
nor received any communication at his
conference with Mr. i*a?sing.
No Keport From Gerard.
Secretary I^ansing said early today
Ambassador Gerard had not up to that
time notified the department of the
receipt of the American note, although
press dispatches announced its arrival
la.-*. e\ening. Neither had Mr. Gerard
reported having received from the German
foreign office another memorandum

disoatches.

| Vice President Ham of W. R.
and E. Company Criticises
Utilities Board Expert.
DECLARES HE IS UNFAIR
AND LACKS EXPERIENCE
: Sharp Colloquies Today at Hearing
on Bill for Merging Two Local
Corporations.
Dr. E. W. Bemis. the expert of The
public utilities commission, was severely
criticised before the House Distrct
committee today by Vice President
Ham of the Washington Railway and
Klecric Company ar:d the Potomac
i Electric Power Company in the hearing:
on. thf Fairehild bill to authorize a
merger between those two corporations.
After hearing; Corporation Counsel
Syme violently assail the railway
and light corporations for what he
termed the placing of "negative obstacles"
in the way of the public utilities
commission's work. Mr. Ham said to
the District committee:
"If there is any one thing which
prevented a thorough co-operation between
the railway and the light company
and the public utilities commission
it was the selection of Dr. Bemis
I as the expert in physical valuation.
| He has the reputation throughout the
| country of always being unfair to the
j railroad companies. He is not practij
cal and lias had no real experience."
Mr. Focht Makes Inquiry.
I Representative Focht of Pennsylvania
made inquiries concerning Dr.
i Bemis while Commissioner -Kutz was
testifying that he was opposed to the
j Fairehild bill and a merger of the two
! corporations. Mentioning Dr. Bemis
[caused Representative Focht to ask:
j "Who is he?"
Commissioner Kutz said he is an authority
on railrdad valuations.
"Is he a magazine writer?"
"Yes." Interjected Corporation Counsel
Syme, "and he has also written
books."
"Well." answered Representative Focht.
j "I have heard of experts who could write
i whole libraries, but who had no pracj
tical experience. I am a practical rail:
road man myself and have built and
; operated street railways."
Speaks in Favor of the Bill.
Commissioner Kutz today told the Dis
t li iti I.UIIUIIIIICC uv|/cn inr r il 11
j chihi bill will not be enacted until after
| the public utilities commission establishes
valuations and proper rates of
service.
Mr. Syme said the bill is a most
ominous one He outlined a series of
difficulties which, he said, the District
committee and the public utilities commission
hail experienced in gaining any
information from the two corporations
as to their inter-relationship, the c:ost
of producing power, etc. He went over
much *of the obi ground of contention
that the railway pays its dividends out
of power company earnings.
"The reason for this lull." he declared.
"is to furnish a justification for
the dividends of the railroad company.
| Relief for the private consumers of
! power would be postponed under this
| bill."
| Represent:*!ive Lloyd of Missouri and
} Mr. Syme then engaged in a little
j set-to as to what constituted "negative
[obstacles." the upshot of the matter
: being hat Mr. Syme explained in general
that there had been a lack of cooperation.
Later the Missourian and
the corporation counsel hail another
skirmish on Mr. Syme's remark, which
seemed to Mr. Lloyd to cast a reflection
on the motives behind the introduction
of the Fairchi.ld bill.
1 Objects to the "Inferences.*'
{ "You have not given us any infor|
mation. but you have left the infer.
ence tha Represenatlve Fairchild has
introduced this bill at the request of
these corporations," said Mr. Lloyd.
; "I have not made any improper inI
ference." replied Mr. Syme sharply.
I "and I will not apologize for something
i not done."
| Vice President Ham said that the
j Washington Railway and Elect ric Com pany
had owned the Potomac Electric
Light and Power Company for many
years and that Congress had full
knowledge of the facts. He believed
it unfair, he said, that the Commissioners
should make violent objecUons
against congressional action fifteen
years old. He had in mind the laws
t passed at the time the railway was reorganized.
He also said that the attitude
of the commission is "that everything
in Washington shall stand still
. until the utilities commission finishes
I its \aluation.'V He said that the utii
! itles commission could establish rates
I under one corporation as well as with
two.

here, however, basing: their

War Department Without News.
The War Department has been without
direct advices from the American
troops in the Parral region for several
days. Messages to the State Department.
however, have indicated that
there has been no additional cause for
alarm as to the situation.
It was learned authoritatively today
that the United States has already
acknowledged through Special Agent
Rodgers at Mexico City the receipt of
I Gen. Carranza's note suggesting the
i withdrawal of the American troops,
j Another message today told of atldi;
tional brigandage in the Mazatia n re;
gion, which Americans are leaving.
The disorder was described as due to
j bands of thieves taking advantage ol

An aspect of the Mexican problem
which officials are watching closely is
the so-called Felix Diaz revolutionary
movement, supposed to be favored by
many of the former Mexican officials
now taking refuge in this country
The whereabouts of Diaz himself is
not definitely known. The State Department
has received information,
however, tending to show that, the
movement is growing in importance

UPON RECRUITING
Members of British Cabinet to
Submit Secretly Proposals
to Parliament.
]
| LOXDON. April 20.?At a meeting to'
day of the British cabinet an agreement
was reached upon the proposals
which the ministers will make to par- j
| liament on the subject of recruiting.
Their proposals will be submitted at a
secret session of each house of parliament
Tuesday. The foregoing was announced
in an official statement issued
! this afternoon.
It is understood that a proposition
1 advanced by Arthur Henderson, presi;
dent of the hoard of education and a
labor leader, will have the effect of renr?<?nirnT
th#> voluntarv enlistment
: scheme for a month or six weeks, and
! 1 that this proposal was adopted in prin*
ciple by the cabinet with a view to as- j
'certaining whether sufficient men would
! come forward for military service with- (
jout the introduction of general com- j
| pulsion.
t The labor members, however, demand
! that all facts arid figures regarding the i
| military situation and requirements!
i shall be submitted to the house of j
commons before they consent to any
measure of universal conscription. This
has not been confirmed officially.
The announcement that the cabinet
crisis has been settled will bring great
relief to a majority of the British
people. The prospect of a general elec1
) tion or any change in the administra
. tion at one of the most important
stages of the war was/recognized as
3 i dangerous, particularly on account of
> the impression it would make abroad

Avoided Submarines.
The Russians are believed to have
mbarked foe France from the port of
rchangel on the White .wa. the onl;
ort through which tliere is free com*
lunioation between -Russia and her aies
in the west. It is considered prob*
hie that the transports carrying the
roops made a wide sweep out into
he north Atlantic before heading for
he Mediterranean to avoid the submaine
danger zone in the vicinity of the
iritish Isles.
Russia has closed the port of Archngel
to all except government traffic,
'his may indicate that other- troop
movements from Archangel to the
restern front are either under way or
n contemplation.
Several times during the war there
ave been reports that Russia waending
troops to the Franco-Belgian
rout, travelers even declaring that#
etachmeuts had been seen en route
(trough Scotland and Kngland. No such
loops have ever appeared on the wast- '
in battle line, however.

lan move in a new Held in the strugle
