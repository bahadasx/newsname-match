TO BE PILLORIED
Names Will Be Published in
the Newspapers If They
Persist.
Barnstown and Bellviow are most |
attractive suburbs now since the i
recent activities of the inhabitants in
aiding the city officials in the clean
up campaign. Mayor Bowen inspected
that portion of the city yesterday and
reports splendid co-operation on the
part of all tho residents.
? With the exception of a feu* isola
ted cases throughout the city the en
tire population has entered into the
spring: clean up with much vigor and
enthusiasm. The few persons who have j
ns yet failed to comply with the re
quests of the sanitary officer and tho j
Mayor will be notified to do so at
once and if they fail to clean up their
property they will either be fined or
their names published in the papers.
In most cases however the l'act that
one person in a locality cleans up in
spires the neighbors likewise to do
so. Thus each person who takes part
In the work becomes an advocate for
the movement and by precept teaches
his less progressive neighbors to be
come active workers in lite campaign.
Work of cleaning up around thoi
waste places on tho Belt lino railroad
on the South Side is being pushed
today and the city officials are receiv
ing the hearty co-operation of tha
factories and property owners in rhat
section. An inspection trip is being
planned by the Mayor and Civic com
mittee of the Woman's club to go all
over the city early next week and
visit the places where formerly the
worst eye-sores existed. These places
are nearly ablitrated and by Saturday
no trace of rubbish will be fouud in
any of them.

If Plans Go Through High
Class Organization Will
Be Maintained.
Canoe enthusiasts, of whom there
arc many in the city and vicinity, arc
going to provide themselves with \
more conveniences at. the river front, j
here and their activities may rcsnlt in |
the formation of a Canoe club, such j
as are maintained in Pittsburgh and j
other points along the Monongahcla ,
and Alleghany rivers. Negotiations aro j
on between a number of canoe own-1
ors and'a party of local people who |
have secured control of a lot owned j
by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad !
company on the East Side, where a :
boat livery was formerly located, by j
which the latter will provide a suit
able landing and storing place for the j
canoes and equipment. A meeting will
likely bo held before the first of tho
month at which the canoists will or
ganize and likely sign an agreement
with the property owners.
It was said last night that there
were at least 50 young folks in Fair
mont who would provide themselves
with canoes provided a proper place ;
to keep them was at hand. When it j
was learned that the railroad com- j
pony's lot had been secured by local j
folks for boating purposes, a deal j
was immediately proposed by the en- j
thusiasts which will likely result in |
a canoe shed or boat house being pro- f
vided there; the grounds fixed up and j
made attractive and dressing and
lounging rooms for the owners pro-1
vided.
The question of when the railroad j
company intends to construct its Pal-,
i atlne branch enters into the arrange-1
1 ments. If the road is to be built
through the city this summer the boat
people will provide for the canoists
I a. large houseboat which can be se
cured aLa down the river point. If
the date.,of the coming of the road is
I remote a Mine litt le lounging room and
shed wil.'be built on the rifjht of way.
I The grffunris are now being cleared j
iof the property on them and tliev will |
| be nicely enclosed by a high fence.
The descent to the river will be made !
close lo the Holt building where a!
comfortable stairway and wide board
walk will lead to the river front and
j floats.
A Kentlomnn long interested In Fair
mont aquatic sports will be in charge
of tho property of the boat company
and will look after the interests of the !
I canoists as ell. The usual boat rent-!
| ing and bathing house features will
> bo maintained and the business will
be conducted along high-class lines.
I It is possible that the canoists will
I meet likely ai the Y. M. C. A. one
j evening this or next week. Already is
J it reported that, over a dozen new
| canoes have been ordered and are due
I to arrive not later than May 15 when
j the season will begin.
