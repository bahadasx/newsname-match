CHANGE OF ROUTES
Expensive Travel Will Not Bo Al
lowed by Judge McClelland.
No trip to Manila, Philippines,
will bo taken at the expense of the
county to take depositions in con
nection with the indictment of
Charles Neiswander for the mur
der of his father-in-law, Edward
Dindore, near Deshler on the
morning of December 13th, 1913.
This was decided by Judge Mc
Clelland at a hearing on the mo
tion to require the defense to state
the names of all witnesses and as
to what it was expected to prove
by each and all of the witnesses,
and upon it being shown that the
parties never lived in Wood
county which counsel for the de
fense admits, and upon the further
showing that the state will not
take the deposition of Richard
Smith in the trial of this case, the
application is refused.
Prosecutor Solethcr and Charles
S. Hatfield represented the state
and B. F. James, the defense. E.
D. Bloom also is attorney for the
defense. Sentinel.

THE LAST APPEAL
In Favor of Bond Issue for Pro
posed New School Building.
This is the last appeal to you be
foro the election on next Tuesday
and we want to appeal to your
good judgment to consider what
this issue means. According to the
arguments of the opposition it is a.
matter of dollars and cents. Mr.
Voter, your boys and girls arc the
best of your possessions and don't
you believe that the money you
would invest in their education
would give more satisfactory re
turns than if you paid for new
streets, sewers, lights, etc.
Again in regard to the money
question, tho village school dis
tricts of the state are in debt over
$48,000,000, and of that we are in
debt $5,000, which was .made last
summer, and if we were not giving
about $3,000 a year to the village
wo would have some money to
loan.
I wish to repeat from the article
of last week : ' ' We have a debt of
$5,000, and we have back of us a
valuation of $3,O39,9G0, while the
village is in debt $112,000 and has
$1,687,540 to back it. Don't you
think we are in fairly good shape
to pay our debt? We have valua
tion enough to maintain 'a high
grade school and this thing will
adjust itself as surely as the sun
shines. As was mentioned last
week, wien the present building
was built, tho valuation of the
school district was $350,000 and
they were not fearful of paying
out then, why should we be afraid
with a valuation of $3,039,960.
In regard to taking in outside
scholars. The board cannot refuse
to let a pupil enter our school, but

they must pay tuition, while Dis
trict No. 2 comes in as a body and
helps pay tho bills as well as our
own people.
And whether they are paying as
much we can say that the pupils of
District No. 2 are paying over
eight times as much as any of our
own town pupils. We would like
to ask if you still disapprove of
their coming in? The board feels
that the more districts that we get
the better the town will be for the
reason that the parents will be at
tracted to our town and they will,
without doubt, do their shopping
here.
Our heating system which you
all know is in very poor shape and
surely will be condemned. The
board wishes to say that an inspec
tor of buildings and factories was
here recently and said that it
would bo condemned as soon as
the fire marshal saw the condition
and we would be required to put
in a new outfit. Wouldn't it be
better to vote "yes" on the bond
issue and get the rest of the im
provements at the same time? A
very short time ago the state agent
for a fire insurance company
which formerly carried a part of
the insurance on our building was
in Perrysburg, and after looking
over the heating apparatus made
tho statement that ho was very
glad that they were not carrying
any of our insurance as the pres
ent outfit is a fire trap. The new
heating system, which is the steam
blast system, which means that
fresh air is blown over steam coils,

The Editor deems it proper to
explain that the Board of Educa
tion used the pages of the Journal
last week for explaining tho plans
of the proposed school building in
stead of publishing the story in

was thus possible to insure a copy

would have been possible by any
