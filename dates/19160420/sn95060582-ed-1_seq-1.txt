may be given to a child as confi
dently as to an adult. It is pleas
ant to take, too, which is of great
importance when a medicine must
be given to young children, This
remedy is most effectual in re
lei ving coughs, colds and croup.

Why Constipation Injures.
The bowels are the natural sew
erage system of the body. When
they become obstructed by con
stipation a part of the poisonous
matter which they should carry
off is absorbed into the system,
making you feel dull and stupid,
and interfering with the diges
tion and assimilation of food.
1'his condition is quickly relieved
by Chamberlain's Tablets. Ob
tainable everywhere.
