MILK PRICES RAISED
WOMEN TO FIGHT
Meeting of Clubwomen. Called To Discuss Action
Statement of Dealers Branded Untrue Council
May Investigate Grand Jury Action Hinted
Women of Chicago, alarmed at
danger of an increased "death rate
amnog the babies, are prepared to
fight the milk price boost Possibil
ity of a demand that State's Att'y
Hoyne make an investigation was
strongly hinted as one way of retal
iation. The plea of the big milk dealers
that they could not make money by
selling milk at 8 cents was branded
untrue in figures made public by the
Milk Producers' ass'n.
, The milk casta .the dfiflTerjn.ezacti
ly 3 32-100 cents a quart right now,
which is only an increase of 79-100
of a cent more than the old prices,"
said W. J. Kittle, sec'y of the pro
ducers. "We believe that if an in
vestigation of the distributing cost
was made the public would soon re
alize just how big a cleanup the milk
dealers were trying to put over.
"The dealers now pay $1.55 for 100
lbs. of milk. In the winter time Bor
den paid $1.77 for 100 lbs. and Bor
den $1.72, but they never made any
squeal then and seemed to be making
