AND TUCUMCARI TIMES
VOL. XIV.
TUCUMCARI, QUAY COUNTY, NEW MEXICO, THURSDAY, APRIL 20, l!U
NO. 3D
39 CARS AND 150 OR
MORE PEOPLE VISIT THE
WHEAT BELT TUESDAY
The "Booster Trip" was n success
in so far uh the citizens of Quny coun
ty and Tucumcnri are concerned. It
waH thought for a time that the trip
would necessurlly he poHtponcd on ac
count of the inclement wenther last
week.
Sec'y Hoyer, who deserved most of
the honor of making the alfnir n suc
cess, was undecided Saturday whether
it would be best to make the trip and
figured on culling it off and postpon
ing same until n week later, hut most
of the business men thought best to
carry out the program aH advertised
so the elevator man, Mr. Chns. .Light,
of Liberal, Kansas, wan notified that
everything was, in readiness for the
trln.
Tuesday was an ideal day to make JnJ ,thu rtm $n "hot around
the trip and thirty cars made the nto th r. . ' J' F aJ nnd b,n,d

from
Hnglund the wind grew strong and
made it hard to travel against. A few
cars from Forrest, Plain, and the east
part of the plains country, joined the
procession there and after a few se
lections by the High School band, and
a comical number put on by Oscar San
dusky and Charles Brown, consisting
of two steps, bear cat, Virginia rag
and bear hug dances, keeping time
with the music, the delegation proceed
t'd to Jordan. During this trip one
1 1 ..r ...l 1
nil imsscu a tiumuur n oiiiern mm
headed otf another, but in doing so it j
had a "blow-out" and stopping very I
uddenly, caused the car behind it
to nearly turn turtle, throwing one of
the occupants out and putting the car
in pretty serious condition. It was
put in shape and caught up with the
crowd at Jordan, where Mr. Light ex
amined the wheat crop of James Jor
dan which was just put in last fall
on new sod. This looked good nnd
was evidence of the fact that others
could do the samo if they would only
try.
From Jordan the delegation went
nearly directly west for several miles
turning south and coming back to
House, making a distance of about 50
miles. Here the crowd stopped for
refreshments. It had been promised
that the good ladies of House would
serve lunch, which most of us thought
would be sandwiches and coffee. Af
ter an hour of social conversation nnd
getting acquainted with the residents
of House, dinner was called and the
cars congregoted near the store of
Mr. Waggoner, where Mr. Nowell, of
the Sale Bros, Studio, used his large
panoramic camcru in taking a picture
of the entire delegation. The store
of Mr. Waggoner was thrown open to
the public nnd the ladies had system
atically arranged the lunch so that it
was served in courses. One place they
handed the hungry visitors sandwich
es, another entree, and others served
cake, pie, cake, pie and pie and cake
to nearly every one from Tucumcari.
while those from the plain stood by
and enjoyed the sight of seeing town
folks get one good square lunch, with
the best coffee possible to serve
such a huge number. Editor Norris,
ol the Pioneer News, worked with the
ladies and make n good roustabout
in the dish-washing department.
The whole delegation was, very inuen
surprised n well iif greatly pleased
at the elegant treatment accorded
them during their slay in House, but
the route-master gave orders to fill
the schedule and all the cirs were
on their way to McAlister with.n a
few minuter, after dinner wn oer.
The Vance brothers acted as pilots
and carried the procession in a zigzag
line to McAlister, which took us iy
the mammoth fields of wheat on their
farms northwest of McAlister. The
country in that vicinity is dotted by
nice dwellings, barns and granaries,
and remind one of the east where the
best farming is now being done. Most
all the way from House to McAlister
one could see wheat fields all doing
fine with prospects of yielding a bun.
ner cron.
The delegation slopped at McAlister
and renin ned about fifteen minutes
!iomo of the fnrme'N there nsuml
the Mr. I.it'hts that if they located In
Tucumcari and paid the price or as
much as that paid by other towns
they could expect to buy everything
ihev had to sell, because they claimed
Tucumcari was the best and cheapest
place to buy their supplies, such as
groceries, dry goods, goal, etc.
Mr. Light made inquiry about the
raising of kafir a.id milo maize. Ho
ald ho wns about as much interested
in those grains as ho was in wheat, as
'ho market for them was good. This
fact mnkos it much more necessary
d put in an elevator in Tucumcari,
as the whole county raises these grains
no matter how dry the weather it.
From McAlister the trip was made
north and west, thonco nearly directly
east to Kirk. Many nice wheat fields
wore seen along this route nnd proved
more conclusively that the north part
of the plain can raise just as good
wheat ns the southern or central. The
crowd stopped at Kirk a short time
and then proceeded north and east to
Plain, where a goodly crowd had gath
ered to greet the boosters. After re
maining there a few minutes talking
over the prospects of the present sea
son the delegation left for home, some
of them going by Puerto and Norton,
but most of them going directly home.
The last car pulled into Tucumcari be
fore dark, making n distance of about
150 miles in less than ten hours ac
tually running time without any very
serious mishaps.

The occupants thought it was going to
reach up over the top of the cur and
cut them in the faces, but luckily it
was too short.
The racing of Murray and Pelzor
was the feature, but Mr. Murray's new
Overland was left at the Barancos
creek until repuirs could be senout
to it. Some of the occupants said
that at times they know Mr. Murray
was making !0 miles per hour, and
we have not heard anyone dispute the
1 question.
At the Valentine crossing, one of
I the cars stopped suddenly and caused
, three of the back cars to come togeth
! er. The front car of the three hud its
back light slightly disfigured and the
left fender and buck of body bent up
some. The middle car had one of its
lamps put out of commission, the
radiator and crank bent in front, and
the left side of the body bent in badly
in the back. The back car came nenr
going off the embunkmcnt, which was
several feet high All the earn wcro
able to proceed after a few minor
parts were repaired.
A few punctures nnd blow-outs were
reported, but the whole string of cure
continued in the two" mile procession
as far us Plain. A number of cars
from House went to McAlister with
the crowd.
The school hand was generous with
its music and played several pieces
at nearly every stop, which wns en
joyed by the farmers as well ns mem
bers of the delegation. The hand was
under the direction of their teacher,
Miss Gardner.
The Messrs. Light were satisfied
with what they saw on the plains and
said that it looked like a twin sister
to Kansas. They are willing to build
an elevator providing freight rates
arc adjusted to put tliem on a par
with towns on the Santa Fe. They
want a good location near the mil
rond whore tracks will he built con
necting the elevator with the switch
yards.
few months ago representatives
of the Bock Island and Kl Pnso &
Southwestern were here and met with
Commissioner Grove and his expert
rate accountant. They promised to
equalize the rates of all New Moxico
towns and this part of the proposition
should not lie very hnrd if the rail-
ml will dc their part and mnke it
possiMe for Tucumcari to assist them
111 pulling more grain to thin shipping
station.
It is understood that the Messrs.
Light will send us a proposition in
writing and the mutter will lie taken
up by the Business Men's Assnc'n, und
given careful consideration in every
detail. It may then be thought ad
visable to send some prominent at
torney and good accountant to Santa
Fc to work over the rate question.
An elevator in Tucumcari would be
a God-send to this part of the state
providing a placo for the farmers to
market their grain, and Tucumcari
would receive her dues when the farm
crs would buy merchandise with the
cash received for their products, The
farmers would secure the best prices
possible because cash always gives a
purchaser the advantage over those
who always ask credit.
EASTER MONDAY HALL
The big Enster Mondny Ball v ill be

A large number of tickets hnvo al

nwablding people. It is there that
our best citizens will make their
homos.") The higher officials of the

erlng people up from all the towns;
along the lino nnd bringing tnem to

UNITED STATES SENDS
ULTIMATUM, SUBMARINE
WAR MUST CEASE
Washington, I). C, April !. "I
have deemed it my duty, therefore,"
president Wilson told congress, "to
say to the imperial Herman govern-
' ment that if it is still its purpose to
prosecute relentless and indiscriminate
war SO the government of the
United States is at last forced to the
i conclusion that there is but one course
it can pursue, and that unless the
imperial Herman government should
now immediately declare un abandon
ment of its present methods of war
fare against passenger and freight
rryltiK vessels this government can
have no choice but to sever diplomatic
relntions altogether."
President Wilson was sneakinir be-
fire the two houses in joint session,
informing them of his final ultimatum
t the German government relative
to its indiscriminate policy of tor-
pedoing ships at sea.
A note, America's last word, prttc-
ticnlly an ultimatum, and demanding
an immediate reply, presumably was
in tho Berlin foreign office as the pies-
i(,ent WHS speaking. It was sent last
man government ai tne same moment
he was addressing the American con
gress. The president asked no action what
ever of congress. He simply informed
it of the accumulation of facts which,
he said, prove that Germany's nssur-
ances to the United States are being
violated; that the submarine campaign
despite the earnest protests of the
United States, is being conducted with
renewed vigor in contravention of all
the laws of nations and humanity,
and that he means to sever relations
unless it is brought within the law.
Diplomatic history shows that such
a course is almost certain to be follow-
led by war.
I he president's note nnd his uddre,--'
to congress tire finul. They mark the
end of diplomutic exchanges. A con-
tinunncc of the long standing friendly
relntions, the president made clear,
depends alone on Germany's future
conduct.

GENERAL FUNSTON SCORES
FALL FOR INJUSTICE TO ARMY
San Antonio. Texas, April 13. -"A
great injustice to the officers and men
of the Thirteeth cavalry." wa the way
General Funslon characterized the re-
cent declarations of Senator Fall in k
report he sent toi'ny to the adjutant
general at Washington. General Fun-
'ton s report to the adjutant general
was in effect a reply to criticism that
Senator Fall made of the conduct of
the troops nt Columbus, when that
town was raided a month ngo by Villa.
General I' wanton explained his re
joinder by saying thnt Colonel Slocum

declared thnt almost every statement
in Senator Full's declaration was fale.
He declared that after the first shot
of the sentry the remainder of the
garrison was in action in about five
minutes. He denied thnt the residonts
of Columbus has aided materially in
the defenso of tho town, styling Sen
ator Fall's assertion that they hud
