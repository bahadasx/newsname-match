Note to Be Delivered by Gerard to German
Foreign Secretary this Afternoon;
Secret Message Received
from Washington
By United Press.
Washington, April 20. Ambassador
Uernstorff was in conference with
""Secretary Lansing for twenty minutes
this morning, discussing the possibil
ity of averting a diplomatic, break be
tween Germany and America and ob
taining Lansing's views In regard to
the steps necessary to be taken by
Germany to bring her submarine op
erations into conformity with Ameri
can interpretation of international
law.
It understood that Uernstorff was
still hopeful following his conference
and that he gave Secretary Lansing
good reasons to show why the Sussex
could not have been torpedoed during
the pending negotiations. He pointed
out that numerous conferences In Uer
li n would be necessary before the
matter is settled.
Later Uernstorff said he did not
think he would have to wait long fur
word from lierlin rei-rding the course
of Germany toward the United
States.

Heiiin, April 20. The United States
embassy here received the last note
from Washington on submarine oper
ations this morning.
Ambassador Gerard expects to de
liver the document to Foreign Secre
tary von Jagow this afternoon.
An important aceret message wa
also received from Washington.
fty United Tress.
.Washington, April 2. Ambassador
Uernstorff was scheduled to visit tho
i.tate department and confer with
Secretary Lnrising today regarding
the grave situation which is believed
to hold the most serious possibilities
involving tho friendly relations be.
tweeu Germany and tho United States.
Uernstorff this morning was still
hopeful of averting a break although
the United States government has put
tho question of severing relations or
modifying submarine operations
squarely up to Germany.
Marines have been ordered to guard
the German wireless stations at Tuck
ertown, N. J., and Sayville, L. 1.,
which niv lit kei.ed in the event of
a break.
Count von Uernstorff already has
re-iterated to Secretary Lansing that
under no circumstances will Germany
give up her submarine as a weapon
of warfare, because, she contends, it
is a retaliation for Great Uritain's
food blockade. The ambassador has
declared, however, that his govern
ment will attempt to bring submarine
operations within the law of nations.
This the United States is willing to
discuss after Germany has abandoned
tier present methods not before.
Against that possibility stands the
declaration in the American note that
the United States has considered from
the" first that the employment of sub
marines for destruction of commerce
is by its very nature "utterly incom
patible with Ulo principles of human
ity, the long established and incontro
) vertibln right of neutrals and the sa
cred immunities of non-combatants."
Clearly tho president's demand is
that the use of the submarlno shall
be restricted to operations against
warships. Upon that rock the friend
ly relations between the two countries
may be rent.
The crisis now resolves itself Into
the waiting stage during which Ger

WORSHIP IS CHARGE
Upon infun.'iation filed by County
Attorney Venable, Roy Helms was ar
rested and brought before Judge Da
venport, of the county court, this
morning charged with disturbing re
ligious worship. The defendant was
released in bonds in the sum of $;iOO
for his appearance in court on tho
first Monday "in May.
The information charges the de.
fendant with disturbing the asseni
blage at Xorge of the Chickasaw Bap
tist association, and the Sunday
school convention ot the B. Y. P. IT.,

and obscene language and Indecent

ment at the hands of Gov. Williams,
Attorney Alger Melton, of this city,
will be the successor of the late Judge
Henry M. Furman as justice of the
state criminal court of appeals.
Mr. Melton this morning confirmed
a report current at the state capital
that Gov. Williams had tendered the
position to him. He declined to state
whether he would accept it. "I have
nothing at all to say in regard to the
matter at this time," said he

British Statistician Figures Kaiser Will Be
Forced to Apply to Foreign Countries
to Recoup Fortune
After War .
EXPENDITURES REACH
STUPENDOUS SUM
Declares Signs Point to Financial Debacle
in "Fatherland;" Suggests Tariff
to England to Preserve Bal
ance of Economic System
(By Wilbur S. Forrest, United Fmb
Staff Correspondent.)
London, April 1. (By Mail.) Jug'
gling stupendous figures to show that
Germany is in desperate financial,
straits, Edmoud Crammond, " well
known British statistician, declared
that the kaiser will be forced to seek
a gigantic foreign loan at tho concliw
sion of peace.
"This means, In effect," said Cranw
mond, "that Germany will repudiate
her internal war debt. ,
Germany's expenditures to data!
amount to about $9,595,000, whilo her;
estimated national wealth la 1913 was
about $75,000,000,000."
"Germany's investments abroad
amount to $5,800,000,00 0 of which,
about $750,000,000 have been, sold in
the United States and the remainder;
are unreliable. Germany's colonies)
ore gone; her shipping industry 1
ruined.
"I do not believe Germany ia living?
and fighting solely on what she is pro
ducing. She Is living on the fat aha
has accumulated during the last fortj
years. ' 1
"The decline In the exchange value)
of the mark and the failures which araj
taking place among the large banks
despite frantic efforts of the govern,
ment to keep the financial machine
going, point to the approach of tha
greatest financial debacle the worlcf
has ever seen." I
Turning to the British financial
problem, Crammond asserted that a
tariff for revenue purposes here la ab
solutely essential for the "preserva
tion of the balance of our economic
system."
He points to Britain's outlay, to
date $.",!)20,000,0o0 including the gross
expenditure and the loans to domin
ions, allies and repayments to the)
Bank of England, declaring:
"We overcame the financial diffi
culties of the first eighteen months'
of war with astounding ease, but the
outlook for tho coming financial year
gives cause for anxiety."
Figuring in the newly established
excess profit tax which he estimates
will bring in about $500,000,000, Cram
mond says that if the nationnal In
come for the coming year should only
reach a sura as estimated for the year
ending March, 1916, the government's
I financial
deficiency at the end of
March, 1917, will be about $4,690,000,
000, "which makes a tariff for reve
nue imperative."
If the war lasts until March, 31,
1917, the statistician estimates that
the expenditures of the various allied
powers approximately will be:
Belgium $ 2,500,000.000
France - 12,500,000,000
Great Britain 13,000,000,000 j
Italy 2,500,000,000
Russia 12,000,000,000 i
Servia-Montenegro 500,000,000 !
Total $ t3,O0O,0OO,0OO
As a measure of exacting a penalty
on Germany for theso expenditures
Crammond suggests that the allied
should pool their indemnities and pre
sent them in a lump to Germany, aIso
that each allied power should under
take to impose:
"A war debt on all German and Aus
trian manufacturers."
"In addition," says Crammond, "th"
maritime powers should impose sup
plementary war debt dues on all Ger
man and Austrian shipping entering
their ports In all parts of the world
"The proceeds from these duties
should be paid over by the allied pow
ers to the war debt commission.
Dr. Antle is spending the day in Ok
lahorua City. He accompanied Dr.
Penquite, who was taken to a hospital
there today.
