"Theec interests depend solely
on the moral effect America's

Why Do People Hate Me and
Attack Me Unmercifully, Asks
Theda Bara In First Article
By Theda Bara
Would you like to he called a "Love Pir
ate," "the Ishmaellte of Femininity," "a
Vampire"- in short, "the woman with the
most beautifully wicked face in the world?"
That is what people call me because of
parts I play in the Fox Film corporation's pro
ductions of "Carmen," "A Fool There Was,"'
"The Olenienceaii Case," "Sin," and the
"Devil's Daughter."
Pretty nearly every person in Hie country
has told what he or she thinks of me, and
NOW, FOR THK FIRST TI.MF, I AM GIVEN
AN OPPORTUNITY TO TELL WHAT 1
THINK OF MYSELF!
Vamplring, such as I do, is the HARDEST
KIND OF HARD WORK.
1 am Imbued with the character and lose
myeslf In it.
Complete exhaustion follows my day of
work.
A year ago when my name was displayed
on the billboards for the first time, the Ameri
can people did not know whether it was a
new tooth paste, soap or a malady. Now
when they see it, they invariably say "THE
HUMAN VAMPIRE."
It Is not pleasant to he so described.
When 1 first heard myself referred to as
'the vamprire woman," I was heartbroken.
All my Ideals were shattered.
I felt I was that against which every wom
an's hand is raised.
1 was held up as one who DELIGHTED in
the LURE OF DESTRUCTION AND EVIL
DOING.
People asked what manner of woman I
could be. One woman wrote this description
of me:
"Her hair is like the ser|ient locks of
Mciliispi, her eyes have the cruel running
of I.urrezia Borgia, TILL NOW held up
as tlie wickedest woman of the world;
her mouth is the mouth of the sinister,
scheming Delilah, nnd her hands are
those of the bhuml-Ihiililug Kli/.nbelli
Hathory, who slaughtered young girls
that she might bathe ln their warm life
blood and so retain her beauty. Can It
Editorial Note: Movie fans who keep scrapbooks of their film favorites will
do well to clip the Tlieda Bara pictures in this series. Each article, for the
present, at least, will be accompanied liy a striking photo of the Vampire Woman.
Many of these are being printed for the first time.

with another evasive note and
what can we do?"

Prosecutor Fred Remann: "It
Is up to the Dutch Kaiser to stand
■fat. The note might hare done
some good six months ago, but
not now. If Herman-, were to re
move the submarine blockade, It
would simply be aiding England
ln getting more supplies."
Whan asked where he was born
the prosecutor said, "In Oer
manr."
be that Fate has reincarnated In Theda
Barn the souls of Ihese^jJ'Mislers of me
diaeval time*'."'
Hardly a day passes iliat the postman does
not bring me letters written along similar
lilies.
MANY OF THEM ATTACK Ml MOST UN
MERCIFULLY.
Some intimate that no woman could por
tray such characters without having had the
actual experience.
Here Is a type of letters I received during
the past few* months:
"You are a menace lo Hie human race.
Man is a mere toy in your hands or those
women like you. Your tyl>e Inevitably
leinls to ruin anil .lestruction. Those glit
tering eyes of youis are like those of the
serpent, except that Ihey are more tlan
g rolls."
Such letters hurt. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO
ACCUSTOM MYSELI' TO THEM.
Why do .people hale me so?
1 try to show the world bow attractive sin
may be, how very beautiful, so that one must
be always on the lookout and know evil even
In disguise.
1 am a MORAL TEACHER THEN, If many
people go to see me and receive my message
as 1 mean to give It to them.
But what is my reward?
1 am detested.
People seem to forget that I am only an
actress; that an aitress should never show
her real self to an audience, else she cease* to
be an actress.
A woman ln New Ydrk saw my photograph
In a frame In front of a theater and deliber
ately jabbed a hole through my face with her
umbrella.
But why do people bate me so?
While some of my best parts show me as a
soulless creature, I think they are ausceptlble
:o defense, and 1 believe the "vampire woman"
can be justified as a type.
1 think there is v great moral lesson taught
ln most of tbe plays In which I have appeared.
Anyway, In my next article, to he pub
lished tomorrow, I am going In file a
brief in au attein.pt to show this.
Deputy Prosecutor Myron
Cramer: "1 am absolutely against
the whole proposition. American
citizens have no right to sail on
vessels bound for helligeraut
ports."
. m »
W. R. Scot^ secretary of board
of county commissioners: "The
note Is rather late, but 1 believe
Germany will make soma conces
sion to avoid trouble. The Teu
tons cannot afford to engage la
war with tbe United States. I
believe it would mean her ult 1
mate ruin."

County Commissioner Slayden:
"The note, coming at this time,
may precipitate trouble. I be
lieve If It had been sent several
months ago there would have
been tomt chance of it doing some
good, but now It looks ss it Wil
son has deleyed too long."

WASHINGTON, D. C„ April 20.
— Count yon Hernstorff today
discussed with Secretary Lansing
the possibility of averting a dip
lomatic break between CcTinuii.v
and America.
Lansing's views were obtained,
and were to the effect that tier
many MIST take steps lo make
her suhmarine warfare conform
to the American vIeWH of human
ity.
Yon Hernstorfl' declined to
comment on the meeting.
ll is iiiiilei'Hlnoil lb.ii he
iln.s in.i take ;i hopeless
view of Die "limition. It is
known Hint lie gave Lansing
reason i,, li.-li.-i.> that anoth
er attack like the Hiissex af
fair will not occur,
lie pointed out that since
America asked a distinct change
in Ihe submarine policy that nu
merous conferences between (It-r
--m.'in officials must take place.
Marine^ have been sent to
guard the wireless station at Say
vile, L. I. Sec. Daniels said that,
the station would not be seized.
The Inclusion of tlie word
"altogether" in the president's
threat of severance of relations
with (lerniany was merely for
emphasis, Lansing said, lie would
not Indicate to what extent the
severance might go.
The recalling of Ambassa
dor <■<■! ml would accom
plish Ihe break with <_cr
muiiy. I'robnhly It.-i nsi.,l : i
woulil be hiitiiled Ills piiss-
IHirts, hut this Im not essen
ilnl. Cln iiiiislimces will gov
ern the situation, Lansing
salil.
The administration's earnest
ness obviously has Impressed
Bemstorff. He fully reported the
situation to Yon Jagow.
The state department reiterat
ed the contention that Germany
must withdraw her submarines
and confine attacks to warships,
pending the result of the Ameri
can note.
Sen. Kern called at the White
i House early and said that con
igrcss wns not disposed to discuss
I the situation, thus leaving the
j president without embarrass
ment.
In reply lo criticisms like Sen.
Gore's, who said Hie president
was risking war because a few
rash citizens insisted on traveling
on armed ships, the White House
pointed out that the controversy
had shifted entirely from an
armed merchantman angle in the
.iissex affair. This vessel was
unarmed and was not B merchant
man.
Note There
BERLIN, April 20.- President
Wilson's submarine note reached
the American embassy here it 11
o'clock this morning.
One section of the ultimatum
was missing.
Ambassador Gerard expects to
give the entire note to Yon Jagow
this afternoon.
A i-oniulen. lal message to the
embassy enjoined absolute
silence.
Won't Yield
LONDON, April 20.—Officials
here do not believe Germany will
yield to the American ultliiiiiliiiii
to cease its submarine warfare.
The opli. on here today In dip
lomatic circles Is .-that a break
between the I'nlted States and
Germany Is certain and that war
is a strong possibility.
This view is based on the i i -t
that Germany has emphasized
tbe submarine as the most ef
fective weapon of warfare against
bngland.
It Is believed the kaiser cannot
afford to concede anything essen
tial, though he may offer conces
sion, hoping to delay events.
The British attitude ranges
from unlet satisfaction to Jubila
tion. It Is believed the note la
likely to Influence other neutral
nations.
