BIG MEETINGS CLOSED
Sunday Night with Over 500 Con
verts. 54 Converts Sunday.
Thank Offering was $480.
The Harper meetings at the big
itabernacle, which have been running
continuously for five weeks, came to
a close Sunday at midnight, with the
greatest demonstrative service and
harvest of converts of any service
'during the whole campaign. In all,
there were flfty-four men and women
•and children who answered the ap
peal of Mr. Harper and went forward
when the invitation was given. Even
the lateness of the hour seemed not
to abate the zeal of the personal
workers or discourage the unchris
tian folks, who lingered, and the line
of converts formed in front of the
platform continued to grow until it
extended one-third of the way back
on the north and south aisles. It
certainly proved to be a fruitful re
gard to the heroic and untiring ef
foi ts of Mr. Harper and all the other
•christian workers.
The meeting Sunday evening be
gan with a lengthy program. With
the big tabernacle crowded to the
doors and many standing, the meet
ing opened with a splendid song and
praise service. The "Big Swede" and
his choir were at their best and the
old tabernacle rang with a mighty
chorus. Mrs. Lloyd Smith and little
Miss Marguerite Adair, each sang
special selections to the delight of
the big audience. Following a spirit
ed tesiimonial service in which many
told of the benefit the meeting? had
been to themselves, personally and to
Leon, pledges were called for as a
thank offering to be used by the
Fairfield Gospel Team in educating
young men for the ministry. Many
expressed regret that they coulJ not
give money, personally, to Mr. Harp
er for his unmeasured services and
time during the meetings. But Mr.
Harper will not accept a penny for
his time and service and has all the
money which is received above the
actual expense of the campaign, sent
direct to the president of the team,
Mr. C. W. Wade, a merchant of Fair
field. Mr. Harper is greatly inter
ested in assisting young men who
aspire to the ministry, and that is the
only way in which anyone can per
sonally express their appreciation by
giving money to Mr. Harper is by
contributing to this fund for the edu
cation of young men for the ministry.
At the morning service two hundred
and seven dollars were received by
pledges and the plate. collection. In
the evening pledges were continued
and more "than two hundred and fifty,
dollars were received. The total
ampunt for the three services of the
day were four hundred and eighty
dollars. It's very probable that the
amount will reach the five hundred
mark when the final report is made
next Monday. The total cost of the
tabernacle and the expense of the
campaign, including the salary of
helpers and entertainment amount to
about $1100. This latter sum was
raised by the end of the second week
of the meetings. People were loath
to leave the services Sunday evening.
Personal workers were busy all the
while and sinners continued to hit
the saw dust trail until the final bene
diction at midnight. There were
many requests for the meetings to
continue another week, but Mr.. Harp
er had staid one week longer than
at first planned and he felt that he
could not stay longer. There is a
movement on with local men to hold
the tabernacle as a public assembly
hall during the summer and fall. If
this does not succeed the tabernacle
will be torn down and the lumber
sold in lots. Mr. Julian Harris do
nated the use ot the lots dur.ng the
meetings.
The four hundred and ninety-seven
converts and fifty-four re-consecra
tions, during the campaign, does not
tell the full value of the meetings. It
has undoubtedly been Leon's greatest
religious campaign. It has quicken
ed and stimulated the churches and
brought forth a response from all
classes of the Leon people. It did a re
markable work in the schools of the
city. While the meetings did not
enlist all of our people and while
some did not fully agree with Mr.
Harper, yet no one could doubt his
sincerity and that he did what he be
lieved to be the best for the cause.
The faces of Mr. Harper, Mr. Scott,
Mr. Daggett and Mrs. Lanning will be
much missed by the' Leon people.
They all worked zealously and great
ly endeared thmselves to the Leon
people. The Fairfield Gospel Team
certafely has a splendid working
force in Harper, Scott and Daggett.
Mr. Harper has executive ability,
quick in speech and action, always
holding the attention of his audience.
Mr. Scott, 'The Big Swede," is al
ways there in all his glory and elicits
an eager' response whether or not
he is singing a solo or leading a
chprus by that big hand and foot ac
tion of his. While Mr. Daggett is not
so prominent in the public work, yet
he fills a place peculiary his own and
most acceptably too. His ever smil
ing, beaming countenance is a gen
uine greeting to all. Besides the.
work at the tabernacle, much work
has been done by these men in stores,
offices, shops and on the street and in
the homes.
The president of the Fairfield
team, Mr. C. W. Wade, was in the
services Thursday evening and made
a splendid talk. Mr. Humphrey* the
man" of Ottumwa, preach
ed Thursday evening and it was great
ly enjayed by a large audience. Mrs.
White of Albia, greatly pleased her
hearers at the womanVmeetihg Sun
day afternoon at the Methodist
church. Mr. John Harper, the father
of. the evangelist, *Mr. A. K. Harper,
was on the platform Saturday ev
ening and Sunday and listened to his
:1k
»i-« ,ry^. ..n,.iiii.yii, i. »ff f^5Wr^"

...rx.j'V
son preach.
The different churches began
their follow-up services Wednesday
evening and will have services this
evening, Saturday evening and close
with the Easter services Sunday.
Sunday afternoon at the men's
meeting a Union Gospel Team was
formed and Phillip Kopp was appoint
ed president. At their first meeting
which will be held at the Christian
church next Sunday afternoon Mr.
Kopp will have charge of the meeting
and George Adair will be the speak
er. Mr. Kopp and Mr. Adair both
went forward during the meetings
and they will receive a splendid hear
ing next Sunday. It is that kind of
a transformation and work that
proves the value of such an evangel
istic campaign and makes the Leon
people thinkful for the meetings,
people thankful for the meetings.
Mr. Harper publicly thanked the
local papers, both the Reporter and
the Journal, for their kindness and
the liberal space they had given to
the meetings.
Awarded a Special Prize.
Ralph Stewart was considerably
susprised the past week to receive a
letter from the Whittall Rug Co., en
closing a draft far ?5 and highly
commending the advertising which
Ralph has been preparing for the
Whittall rugs which are handled at
the F. S. Stewart Big Furniture Store
in Leon. The Whittall firm recently
conducted a prize contest in adver
tising writing, which was participat
ed in by the best high salaried adver
tising writers of the United States.
In awarding the three cash prizes,
the committee also took occasion to
make honorable mention of the ad
vertisements submitted by Ralph, and
while no prize was offered, the Whit
tall people enclosed a draft for $5
as they considered he was entitled to
a prize. Ralph is only seventeen
years of age, but for some time has
had full charge of the advertising for
the Stewart furniture house, and he
has prepared excellent and readable
advertising. He is greatly interested
in the work and we will not be sur
prised to see him engage in this work
as a profession, which is one which
commands the very highest salary,
and good advertising writers are in
great demand.
Mrs. George Cox Struck by Auto.
An unfortunate accident occurred
in front of the tabernacle last Sun
day evening when Mrs. George Cox,
of southwest of Leon, was struck by
A. L. Ackerley's auto and sustained a
slight cut on the forehead and sever
al bruises. Mr. Ackerley was driving
his car at, a very low rate ot speed,
scarcely moving. Another car was
coming from the north and the lights
blinded Mr. Ackeriey and Mrs. Cox,
who in watching the car from the
north steppeu or stumbled and fell in
front of Mr. Ackerley's car, being
struck oy the fender. No blame
could be attached to anyone. Mrs.
Cox was brought to the Leon hospi
tal and her injuries were dressed
and she was able to return home the
same evening. There was a large
number of cars in front of the tab
ernacle, the street being congested,
and everybody is feeling good that
Mrs. Cox escaped any serious injury.

THE COUNTY CONTEST
Leon Won First and Third Plate at
Triangular and County Declam
atory Contest at Van Wert.$|
There was a big crowd at. the
county declamatory contest held at
Van Wert last Friday evening, no
building being large enough to hold
the crowd and the contestants spoke
twice, first at the Christian church
and then at the overflow meeting
held at the Methodist church. There
were two divisions of the contest, the
triangular, composed of the accredit
ed schools of the county, in which
Leon was represented by Miss Nancie
Kemp, Lamoni by Miss Blanche Gar
mon, and Garden urove by Miss iieva
Duling. The county contest had sev
en contestants, from Leon, uavis
City, Van Wert, Decatur, Weldon,
Garden Grove and Lamoni.
The judges were Supt. Reed of Os
ceola, Supt. Bailey of Humeston, and
Miss Mary Buffum, of Leroy. In the
triangular contest Miss Nancie Kemp
won first place, with "The Death
Disc," Miss Neva Duling of Garden
Grove second with "Pro Patria, and
Miss Blanch Garmon, of Lamoni,
third with "Ex-Convict B-606."
In the county contest Miss Mar
guerite Peague ot' Weldon, was
awarded first place with "How the
i^aRue Stakes were Lost," Miss Olive
Jennings of Garden Grove, second
place with the same selection, and
Miss Marjorie Shular of Leon, third,
with "Patsy.' Each of the contest
ants awarded places were presented
with medals.
Leon is exceptionally proud of the
record made this year by Miss Nancie
Kemp, as she has won first place in
five contests, the only contest in
which she failed to win being the
state contest at Carroll, and one of
the judges in this contest marked her
for first place. The contests which
she
Avon
were county, sub-district,
quadrangular, district and triangular
and she has a collection of medals of
which any young lady would justly
be very proud of.

Another Decatur County Boy Making
Good.
It always gives us great pleasure
to note of a Decatur county boy who
has gone out into the world and is
making good, and we have just learn
ed of another one, Harold Harris,
son of P. G. Harris, who now lives at
Osceola, but for many years was a
resident of Decatur county. Harold
has accepted a position in the First
National Bank at Sioux City, and
we'll guarantee that he will make
good. He has many boyhood friends
in this county who wish him success.
First Band Concert Saturday Night.
The weather permitting the K. of
P. band will give the first open air
concert of the season on Saturday
evening of this week. The boys have
been practicing faithfully under di
rector Tansey for a number of weeks,
and we will have a dandy good band
this year. The Saturday night band
concerts in Leon are mighty popular
and everybody has been asking when
the concerts would commence. Come
out Saturday night and hear the fine
music.
Seed Corn Not Testing Well.
One of our best corn raisers told
us the other day that the farmers in
Decatur county had better look out
for poor seed corn this year. He
tests his seed every year, and last
fall as usual selected what looked to
him to be all good seed, but when
he tested it out in a tester he found
that only about forty per cent was
good. Another thing he, discovered
was that the big ears did not test
out near as well as the smaller ears.

W. C. STARR BADLY INJURED.
Former Reporter Employe Will Prob
ably Be Crippled for Life as He
suit of Accident in Des Moines.
We have received a letter from
W. C. Starr, who was for several
years foreman of The Reporter office,
who moved to Des Moines in Janu
ary, giving the particulars of an acci
dent which he met with on the morn
ing of April 1st. Since going to Des
Moines Mr. Starr has been employed
in the Homestead office, and while
passing through a hall on his way to
the composing room, a large radiator
fell over on him, badly crushing his
left foot. His cries brought fellow
workmen to his rescue and he was
rushed to the Methodist hospital
where the physicians took an X-ray
photo of his foot which showed that
practically every bone from the ankle
down was broken, but the bones in
his toes were not hurt much. The
foot was in such shape that nothing
could be done at that time and he
was placed in a ward where he re
mained until Sunday, when he was
operated upon in the hope of saving
his foot, no amputation being made
at this time, his foot being placed in
a plaster cast, and he was taken to
his home on Tuesday. He writes he
is resting very well under the circum
stances, but at times the pain in his
foot is terrible. The doctor in charge
cannot tell what the outcome will be,
as it may be that amputation may
ha.ve to be performed at the ankle.
The radiator which caused the ac
cident was one which had been taken
from another part of the building,
an extra large one. One of the legs
had been broken from the radiator
and it had been blocked up against
the partition wall and Mr. Starr did
not know but what the radiator was
attached to the steam pipes. What
caused it to fall on him is not known.
He has retained an attorney who will
shortly commence an action for dam
ages against the owner of the build
ing, alleging carelessness in leaving
the radiator so that it could fall over.
Russell and Campbell Bound Over to
Federal Grand Jury.
Burley Russell and Arthur Camp
bell, the two L.eon young men, who
were arrested last week charged with
entering several freight cars at the
Leon station on the night of April
1st, were taken to Creston last Fri
day morning by deputy U.S. marshals
W. W. Exline and Harrison Kelso,
their preliminary examination being
held on Saturday, the boys being rep
resented by attorneys C. W. Hoffman
and Marion Woodard. Federal Com
missioner J. C. Hunt bound them
over to the federal grand Jury under
bonds of $50 each. Campbell gave
bonds and was released, but Russell
was unable to secure a bond and is
in jail at Creston. Campbell was
also charged with bootlegging, but
could not be taken to Creston before
to answer to this charge on account
of being quarantined with scarlet
fever, and since the new and greater
charge has been filed against him, U.
S. attorney Moon dismissed the boot
legging charge against him.
Installed New Refrigerator Meat
Case.
W. D. Pleuss this week installed a
new refrigerator display meat case
in his up-to-date meat market, which
is the very best thing in this article.
The new case extends across the en
tire front of the shop, end the top is
used as a counter. It is all glass and
white enamel, and the meats are
right in plain sight, and can be kept
at the right temperature and abso
lutely sanitary. In the center is a
big ice compartment, and the icea
air travels through both ends of the
case, the cold air forming a circula
tion by forcing the warm air to the
top and there is ample display room.
Drop in and see this case, it's a dan

Senior Class Play—A New Plan.
The class of 1916 of the Leon High
School will present "All-of-a-Sudden
Peggy," on Friday evening, April 21,
at 8:30 o'clock.
Heretofore several plays have been
given and each member of the class
has haa a part. This year there will
be but one play and the cast will in
clude only about one^-third of the
class. The royalty on "All-of-a-Sud
den Peggy" is more .than we have
ever paid before. Miss Ivan Bloom
of Des Moines, who prepared our stu
dents for the declamatory contests
will do the training work.
It is the aim of the class to furnish
quality. Financial gain is a second
ary consideration.
Announcement.
The City of Leon is now ready to
sell lots in the new addition to the
cemetery. This new addition was se
cured and platted at great expense to
the city. If all who think of securing
lots would buy them now, it would
help the committee very much in
their work of beautifying the grounds
so buy your lots now friends. It will
help us out. First to come gets first
choice. Plat at the mayor's office.

The fortieth anniversary of the M.

last Sunday. The first church was
organized in Leon in March, 1851, at
the home of John R. Jordan, with
the following members: John Patter
son, class leader, Parmelia Patterson,
John R. Jordan, Artemesia Jordan,

son, who was present, and Mrs. Ar
temesia Jordan, who resides in Den
ver. The present membership of the
church is 160 and at the roll call 85
members responded. Aunty Patter
son related some reminiscences of
early Methodist'days. It was impos
sible to obtain a complete report, but
the following was taken from notes:
"We landed in the prairie the 3rd of
November, 1850 My husband put up
a building on the north end of the
cemetery, 11 feet square. In the
summer of 1851 we went to Missouri
to quarterly meeting, mill and post
office. At the quarterly meeting in
Missouri, the elder told a young
preacher named Klepper to come
here and organize a church and lie
would write to the Iowa Conference
to send us a missionary. He did so,
and Lyman Briggs was sent in the
fall of 1851. On his way back to
Leon lie came through Garden Grove
and was invited to come back there
and preach. He consented and after
he filled his appointment here he
went back to Garden Grove. He was
to preach in the evening at the cabin
of the man who gave him the invi
tation, but when hef-came there that
evening there was a dance in pro
gress. His host told him he could
either wait until the dance was over
or preach in the other room of the
cabin as a result there was no
preaching. He preached here for
three months and held his meeting
in our cabin where Aunt Jane Miller
now resides. We nad our services on
week days as Brother Briggs had five
counties in his charge. He preached
on Sundays at the county seats. That
was before our county seat was laid
out. After Briggs came J. Parker
and a Mr. Davis. As soon as the
county seat was laid out we brought
our meetings in town. The first
quarterly conference was neld in a
frame building where the fcorgrave
residence now stands. Jay was the
first presiding elder and the collec
tions amounted to over $60. We
built our church and got the frame
up and put on one coat of plaster and
had plank seats without any backs.
We took a stand we had for the
preacher to lay his bible on. Broth
er Shaffer then told me he would
make a pulpit if I would cover it, to
which I agreed. He made the pulpit
and I covered the sides with dark
green and the top with dark blue. I
then made a cusnion for the pulpit
out of gray cloth. For lights Shaffer
made tin lamps and I found material
to put in them. For a bible the
preachers used to carry ours to and
from the church under their arms,
and I had a room especially for
preachers and nearly a hundred
preachers have slept there. We used
to have some of the grandest sermons
there I ever heard, with one excep
tion, and tnat was one by Bishop
Ninde at the dedication of our pres
ent church. E. P. Ingalls was one of
them. We had prayer meetings at
:our
Mayor J. M. Gardner.

A Request.
The time for our annual clean-up
is now here. Much good work haa
already been done, but much still re
mains to be done before our city
looks as it should. In place of clean
up day, let us have a clean-up week,
beginning April 24th and ending on
April 29th, inclusive. Every good
citizen ought to have pride enough to
look after removing their own filth
and rubbish. However, some have
not and to make the clean-up the
success it ought to be I am going to
ask every member of the several
clubs in the city to select three or
four blocks in their immediate vicin
ity and personally see that every one
in those blocks are reminded of their
duty. Also suggest many better
things to them that will add to the
beauty of the city. Nearly every tree
in Leon needs trimming. Run the top
up. Let in the air. You will be
pleased with the results.

Train Caught Fire.
They had quite an exciting time
on train No. 114 from St. Joe to
Chariton one day last week when it
was discovered that the whole front
vestibule of the ladies' coach was on
fire. The train was between Albany
and Gentry at the time, and some of
the passengers were nearly suffocat
ed by the smoke before they could
get out of the coach. Brakeman C.
H. Jenree finally chopped a big hole
in the roof and the fire was extin
guished, but the coach was pretty
badly damaged.
