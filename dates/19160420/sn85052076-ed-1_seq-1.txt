Spring
Surely work is a pleasure these spring days! It is a
delight just to be out-of-doors and every bud and dande
lion and hopping bird makes us feel more like building
good fences, and plowing good furrows, and putting in
good seed.
And as we do our spring work let us think what it is
all for. It means a good Thanksgiving Dinner next
fall. It means some improvements about the house. It
means a sure dollar to pay for the Citizen, and money
for the children's schooling.
Let us do all the extra work, and take all the extra
pains we can this spring. And then let us pray with,
right hearts to the great Giver of all harvests. One may
plant and another may water, but it is God that giveth
the increase!
The Dixie Highway
The Dixie Highway is intended to benefit a great
many people.
It means easy transportation.
Now transportation is a tax. It takes something off
the price the farmer gets, and it adds something to the
price the consumer pays. Lessen cost of transportation,
and you benefit the farmer who sells produce, and the
village woman who buys produce.
And the Dixie Highway means easy travel. Your
son will travel over more country, know more people,
have more girls from whom to pick his wife!
Everybody along the line will get some of the money
that is paid out in making the Dixie Highway. Some will
get work, others will furnish food for the workers.
And do you know some of the people most benefited
by the road will try to steal money from it by charging
high prices for little scraps of land or otherwise "holding
it up"? And others will give days and days of unpaid
labor to helping the thing through.
Every public enterprise shows who are sheep and
-who are goats!

TO PROBE CONVICT'S STORY
Claimed to Have Assisted In Burying
Dorothy Arnold.
New Tork. April 18. Police Inspec
tor Joseph Faurot, In charge of the
detective bureau of the police depart
ment, sent a telegram to the chief of
police of Providence, asking for In
formation regarding the alleged con
fession of Edward C. Glennorts, a con
vict In the Rhode Island state prison,
who was reported from Providence as
having confessed that he asstated In
burying a girl he thought waa Dorothy
Arnold, the New Tork heiress who
disappeared In December, 1910. The
police seemed Inclined to doubt the
story and suspended action on It un
til they might learn more about It
direct from Providence.
The Arnold family and their attor
ney, John B. Keith, discounted the
story altogether.
Artillery nen ana new.
"Aad Jouatlian gave his artillery

In these days of big guns. The mind
Involuntarily pictures the little lad
walking off with a sixteen Inch gun
tucked beneath either arm. But It la
worth retailing that "artillery" orlgt-
nally meaut only arrows and missiles
of that kind. Some have derived the
word from "arcus," a bow; others from
"artelaiia," the art of missile throw
ing. The Orat development toward the
big modern meaning, however, may be
traced in the Scriptures when we read
of "engines Invented by cunning men
to shoot arrows and great stones."

and to withdraw them in a "reason
