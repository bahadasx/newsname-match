Wilson's long expected final ware
ing to Germany that the Unitei
States will break off diplomatic rels
tions unless she abandons her pres
ent methods of submarine warfare
and immediately declares her inten
tion to do so, was delivered today 11
a note to Berlin and was announce*
by the President in an address to i
joint session of Congress. The Pres
ident demands nothing less than th
abandonment of submarine warfar
against commerce.
Both the President's address an*
the American note declare in un
equivocally that only by Germany ac
ceding to the demand can the break
ing off of relations be prevented.
The President considers that th
next step depends solely upon Ger
many and that three or four day
constitute a reasonable time for ;
i reply. He is willing to discuss hov
submarine warfare may be conduct
ed within the limits of internationa
law and humanity after German;
abandons her present methods.
Diplomatic history records onl;
one instance as yet where a break
ing of relations between two first
class Powers has not eventual 1;
brought war?that which now exist
f between Germany and Italy.
. Congress received the President'
! declaration of his course with mix
B ed evidences of concern and appro
HB. bation. Most of the leaders, Dem
^^Bklocratic and Republican, thought th<

action would not lead to war.

and told him so, but he shook his
head and went on. His first big
IjN meeting was held at Manning,where
1,200 people professed conversion.
Since then his greatest trouble is to

IE- people who come to hear him. At
Orangeburg they built a huge building
to seat 3,000 people, and it was
'Pen* seldom large enough to take care of

made a host of friends. All of his

this State,but it is doubtful if he can
ia be held here much longer, as calls

as he prefers to work among
very his own people. However, he has
