CONSERVE THE MOISTURE.
J. F Newsome, county agent for the
U. S. Department of Agriculture, has
Issued a letter to the farmers of Bea
rer County in an effort to impress
I them with the vital importance of con
serving the moisture, of which the
ground now holds an ample supply,.
I In order that the winds nnd sun may
not rob the ground of this moisture
1 he advises that it it absolutely nects
' sary that land to be planted to spring
crops, should be double disced as soon
I as you can get into the Held. By this
! time every farmer is familiar with the
'principal involved that the dust
mulch thuB formed acts as a blanket,
so to speak, preventing rapid cvaporn
I tion of the molBture from the eotl
I Mr. Newsome further states that if
j this method U followed and the land
kept free of needs by further discing,
Beaver County need have no fear of a
I crop failure the coming season,

SUFFERS PAINFUL INJURY.
What might have been a fatal acci
dent occurred at the court house. Sat
urday of last week, when a heavy tim
ber, forming part or a scaffold, fell
and struck J. S. Ferris on the side of
the head. Had the timber (truck a
more direct blow, the skull must have
been crushed, but as It was the brunt
of the blow was caught on the ear.
The ear was badly mangled and it was
necessary for Mr. Ferris to receive
treatment from Dr. Levi at the Beaver
Hospital. Later reports are to the
effect that he has suffered no perms
nent injury, ar.d that wound is healing
nicely.
