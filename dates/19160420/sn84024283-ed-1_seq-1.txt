Political Pointers. , t
. Missouri taxpayers will hesitate a
long time before taking the adyice of
the band of political brigands who
have been looting St. Louis in the
name of the Republican party.
, While Roosevelt raves and howls,
President Wilson proceeds quietly at
his noble work of keeping the United
States at peace with the warring na
tions. Of these two, posterity will
not have to decide which was the
greater and the better malr. , The
verdict is already in, and will be re
echoed at the polls next November.
Whenever there is a fight between
Democrats, there is always a Republi
can larking in the ( background. Re
member this, you Democrats who
feel disposed to quarrel. It doesn't
pay, lb doesn't win. Whenever
Democrats fight each other, the Re
publicans gain the victory. No Demo
crat can win anything, either for him
self or for hia party, by abuBing other
Democrats.'
: v. ' ' .- . -i '
. If the people of St. Louis want to
reduce tbeir taxes by lowering their
assessed valuation they have the right
to do so, und we think they should
Something should be done to abate
the extravagance of the St. Louis Re
publican machine. But this does' not
afford any reason for increasing the
taxes on Missouri farms. It is cost
ing twice as much to govern the city
of St. Louis as It costs to govern the
entire State of Missouri. St. Louis is
' a Republican city, and if those people
want their money wasted by Incom
petent public officials, that is their
business. But the people of Missouri
do not take kindly to substituting, in
tyieir State government, Republican
extravagance and incompetency for
Democratic economy and efficiency.
