Long Message to Kaiser
Washington. April 20.—The United States government, having
said its last word to Germany in the submarine controversy, turned
to-day.with grave expectancy to Berlin, where rests the decision
whether the imperial government shall abandon its present methods
of submarine warfare or break with Washington.
President Wilson probably will wait at least until the end of the
week for Germanv to reply to his virtual ultimatum, which declares
the intention of the United States to sever diplomatic relations un
less the Berlin government "immediately" gives up the use of sub
marines against commerce and squares her submarine policy with
the principles of humanity and international law.
Xo time limit was set in the communication, but the President is
known to hold the opinion that three or four days would be a reason
able period to allow to Germany for a decision. If none is forth
coming within a reasonable time the step accomplishing a break in
relations with all its grave possibilities, will be taken. Count \on
Bernstorff, Germany's ambassador, would receive his passports and
American ambassador Gerard at Berlin would be instructed to come
home.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, went to the State De
partment to-day for a conference with
Secretary Lansing on the submarine
warfare situation and also to discuss
!he arrest in New York of Wolfe von
tgel, secretary of former German mili
tary attache Yon Papen. They were
In conference fully twenty minutes.
After the ambassador had left, the
Secretary of State would make no
Statement regarding the discussion
which took place.
Early Reply Impossible
After the conference it was learned
that German diplomats regard the re
ceipt of a reply from Germany within
two or three days as physically impos
sible. It was thought a reply could
not be received here before ten days.
It was pointed out that Easter Mon
day is a holiday in Germany and that
necessary consultations of officals
would cause almost another week to
elapse before the German decision
could be transmitted here.
Ambassador Bernstorff refused to
discuss his convention with Secretary
Tensing but indicated his coll was not
prompted by the arrival of instruc
tions from his government.
Prospects About Kven
Regarding the liope hold by Ger
man officials here for an amicable set
tlement, one official described the
prospect as a "toss up."
Secretary Lansing explained in de
tail to the German ambassador the
position of the Cnited States and is
understood to have expressed the sin
rere hope that the attitude of the
German Government would t>e so ad
justed as to meet the position taken
l\v the United States.
The ambassador was understood to
have informed the Secretary of tlie
fic-iails of a message he sent yesterday
t 1 his government making certain
r> commendations which he believed,
if acceptable to his government, would
he satisfactory to the United States.
Xot Sanguine
In addition the ambassador in
formed the Secretary of a fnessage of
highly confidential nature he had re
ceived from Berlin.

peared hopeful that some way would
be found to prevent a break of rela-

After returning to the embassy.
Count von Bernstorff prepared a long
dispatch which probably will be sent
to this government before night. The
ambassador was authoritatively rep
resented as having sought the Secre
tary's views in regard to a tentative
proposal that Germany issue imme

marine operations similar to that Is
sued on January 7 for the operations
in the Mediterranean. How the sug

Removes Ban Against
Children Attending
Services on Easter
Dr. J. .M. J. Raunick. city health
officer, announced to-day that all chil
dren. regardless of age, may be ad
mitted to services 011 Easter, removing
tlic ban which kept boys and girls
under years of age from Sunday
school April 9 and It!.
Although last week it seemed almost
necessary to close the Sunday schools
to children again on Easter because of
the measles epidemic. Dr. Raunick
said to-day that the co-operation dur
ing the last few weeks made it possible
to remove the ban from the Sunday
schools. Only twenty-five near cases
Oi measles were reported to-day.
The Health Bureau at its meeting
last night authorized Dr. Raunick to
select the date for the annual Spring
• lean-up in Harrisburg, but the health
officer said to-day that unless the
Pennsylvania Reduction Company gets
back on schedule in making ash and
garbage collections it will be almost
impossible to have a clean-up week.
The bonding company for the reduc
tion organizatoin was notified to-day
of the situation here since the recent
strike of ashmen and will probably
take action.

The President's ultimatum to Germany on the U-boat issue has made
the severance of diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany
highly possible. In the event of the severance of relations, Count Johann

BRYAN HERE, IS
FLATLY AGAINST
WILSON'S MOVE
Dclares It Would Be Crime
Against Civilization to Go
Into War
William Jennings Bryan, former
Secretary of State, who passed through 1
Harrisburg to-day on his way to Wash
ington, let it be known that he is de
cidedly against the President's latest
move in the German controversy.
."I believe it would be a crime
against civilization for this country to
go into this war, and therefore unwise
for the country to do anything that
would increase the chances of going l
into war," declared Mr. Bryan.
The ex-secretary was en route from
St. Louis to Washington, D. C. He
had intended going to .New Orleans to
attend a teachers' meeting there, but
after reading the ultimatum to Ger- ,
many in the papers he decided to go to
the capital. The train from the West
was late and stopped in Harrisburg
but five minutes. Mr. Bryan bought :
s<\eral newspapers and shook hands
with half a dozen station attaches. '

Congress Will Enact
Legislation Repealing
Free Sugar Clause
By Associated Press
Washington, April 20. Legislation
repealing the free sugar clause of the
tariff, which was to have become ef-'
fective May 1 next, will be enacted im
mediately by Congress.
This was decided upon at a caucus
of Senate Democrats last night when
they voted to accept the House repeal
iiiii instead of the Senate substitute
providing for the retention of the ex- i
isting duty of one cent a pound on
sugar until 1920. As a result the pres
ent duty will be continued indefinitely.
The caucus action was influenced by
arguments of House leaders that the
government was greatly in need of
revenue. Senate leaders had hereto
fore insisted upon free sugar, con
tending that a tax on a necessity of
life was contrary to Democratic pol
icy. The Senate majority were to vote
to-day to recede from the disagree
ment with the House, thus putting the
I caucus action into effect.
