L. N. Reel is cleaning out his
gutters about his residence, . a
very needful improvement, and
very much to be commended as
enhancing the appearance, and is
something many more ought to
do. Mr. Reed ought not to be
alone in the performance of such
l.tedful embellishment.
The third quarterly meeting of
this circuit was held .yesterday
afternoon at Horatio. While the
weather was propitious-, yet the
attendance from here failed for
want of jitney to convey.
Our M. E. ladies held a bazaar
and served supper in the base
ment of the church and it seems
from report the venture was en
couragingly lucrative and they
feel glad of it. They adopted a
new departure in the service,
which was that eatables were
served by them. Everyone chose
their articles and paid for what
they goj. To the writer this
seems the proper way to conduct
such ventures. They are not
given to feed the hungry wholly,
but to raise money for religious
improvements or charity and for
these reasons alone the largest
amount of money is the object
sought and this plan will get it:
Gormandizing for such occasions
ought to be cut out as much as
possible.
We are now looking forward to
Easter, a day we never fail to
celebrate in some way, but most
ly in one way. It is a church
festival and celebrates the res-
urrection of Christ, and while it
i3 movable, there is an invariable
rule to determine its date, and
adopts the first Sunday following
the full moon occurring after the
20th of March. This year Easter
occurs as late as it is possible for
it to come. . . ,
Our M. E. Sunday school had
an attendance yesterday of 139.
On next Sanday it is the wish of
our superintendent to have 200
or more present. Will the num
ber be there? If weather condi
tions are favorable we confident
ly expect them there. . The peo
ple are in the vicinity and they
will not fail. At that time many
of us will haYe new. clothes and
catchy headgear and will want to
get out to show our; finery, , and
not only that, but to see what
others have, on exhibition. Oh,
yes, we will all want to see and
be seen. Let not this be our on-
' ly motive, but rather to do good
and advance the cause pf righte
ousness. ,

Report has it that General Vil
la, the Mexican bandit, has pass
ed to that bourne from which no
traveller returns,' but whether it
is true we know not. It seems to
be shrouded with doubt and lacks
confirmation. It seems Uncle
Sam has undertaken a pretty
large job in his endeavor to cap
ture or disperse the Villa forces
and when it is to be accomplished
no one knows. If this report
should prove a canard there is no
telling when that undertaking
will be accomplished, but in any
event it is to be hoped the pur
suit and trouble will end ere long.
Peace ought to be our ruling pas
sion, and ought to be assiduously
sought after and pursued after
with a purpose to let no oppor
tunity pass to secure it.
The German fight to take Ver
dun is now in its ninth week, at
tended with a large sacrifice of
life and money and when the end
will come is yet a matter of con
jecture and who will finally tri
umph no one knows. But the
end must come some time, sooner
or later, and when it does come
the winner will be the loser, and
how about the nations falling.
To them it will be the costliest
experience taey ever had. May
the dove of peace speedily visit
these bellicose people.

Publishers are now accepting

In Action."
In his address ts temporary chair
man of the New Yorktarate Republican
convention, delivered hi Carnegie Hall,
New York, the Hon. Eliliu Hoot ald:
We are entering uptfn u contest for
the election of u president nnd the con
trol of government finder conditions
essentially new In tie experience of
our party anil of our country. The
forms UDd methods which we are
about to follow ure jtld and familiar.

mass of American voters now living.
iever since lnu uusiiui election neen

erations which play so great n part in
our presidential canApiilgus are a"nd
ought to be dwarfed Into insignificance
- Democratic Parti to the Bar.
For the lirst time inf twenty years we
enter the tieid as thdj party of opposi
tion. and indeed it I n much longer
time, for in 18!i, iuLiii respects save
the tariff, the ,real Apposition to the
sturdy and patriotic! course of Tresi
dent Cleveland wu be found lu the
nartv that followed IJr. Bryan. It is
- m.
our duty as the oppoiJLiou to brini th.
Democratic party to le bar of public
Judgment, to jut it Fpon its defense
so far aa we see jusl nnd substantial
grounds to criticise ill conduct and t
ask the voters of the country to decid..-
whether that pialy. wMVized a (t t-
represented as it has been since it
came into power, has shown itself
competent to govern the country as it
should be governed and whether its
spirit, its policies, and its performance
are the best that the American people
can do in the way of popular self gov
ernment
In the field of domestic affairs some
facts relevant to these, questions had
already been ascertained, when in Au
gust. 1914. the great European war
begun. During the year and a half of
Democratic control of government in
a period of profound peace there had
been a steady decrease In American
production, in exports 'and in revenues
and a steady increase in imports and
expenditures. Enterprise hud halted.
The Democratic tariff bad been framed
upon an avowed repudiation of all pro
tection. however moderate and reason
able, and because all' protection was
repudiated practically all information
from corapetent witnesses as to the ef
fect new provisions would have upon
business was rejected. It vas with
just cause that the enterprise of the
country halted, timid and Irresolute
because it felt and feared thp hostility
of government.
Foreign Competition After War.
The great war has not changed the
lesson which we bad already learned
when It !egan. It 'has' but obscured
further demonstration. It has caused
an enormous demand for some thing
which the United States- is able to pro
duce in large quantities, mid in these
lines of production, while other Indus
tries still languish, there have been ex
tensive employment of labor, great es
"ports and a great influi of money
But this Is temporary. It must soou
cease, and 'when the factories have
stopped and 'their laborers are no
longer employed we must deal with a
situation for which wise forethought
should make provision..- More Impor
tant still, the war has paralyzed the
peaceful Industries- of ail Europe and
has stopped that competitive foreign
production which in July. 1014. had al
ready entered American markets to
supersede American products under
the tariff law of 1913. The war has
thus given to American products an
Immunity from competition far more
Effective than any possible protective
tariff. Bnt that is temporary, and
when the war is over. when foreign
production begins again; the American
market compared with impoverished
Europe will be more than ever before
the object of desire and effort, and we
shall become the dumping ground of
the world to the destruction of our
own Industries unless that is prevented
by a wise and eompeteut government
How Can Wa Defend OurseivesT
But it is not from domestic ques
Hons that the most difficult problems
of this day arise. The events of the
last few years nave taught us many
lessons. We have learned that civiliza
tion Is but a veneer thinly covering the
savage nature of manr. How can this
nation, which loves peace and Intends
justice, avoid the curse of militarism
and at the same time preserve its in
dependence, defend its- territory, pro
tect' the lives and liberty mid proper
ty of its citizens? How can we pre-
rent the same Prinze, of action the
mn Policies of conduct , the mm
forces or military power which are ex
hibited In Europe from laying hold
upon the vast territory und practically
undefended wealth of the new world?
Have we still national ideals? Will
anybody llr for them? Would any
body die for them? Or are we all for j
ease and comfort and wealth at any
price? Confronted by such questions
as these and the practical situations
which give rise to them, is the coun
try satisfled to trust itself again In the
bands of the Democratic party?
Impotent Inteference In Mexico.
The United States had rights and
duties in Mexico. More than 40.000 of
our citlz lind sought their fortunes
and nifldc tlieir homes there. A thou
sand millions of American capital had
been invested in that pnductive coun
try. But revolution had come, and
factional warfare was rife. Amer'.cans
had been murdered, American proper
ty had been wantonly destroyed, the
lives and property of all Americans in
Mexico were la danger. That was the
situation when Mr. Wilson became
president in March. 10i:i. His duty
then was plain. It was. first, to use
his powers as president to secure pro
tection for the lives and property of
Americans In Mexico and to require
that rules of law and stipulations of
treaties should be observed by Mexico
toward the United States and its citi
eons. His duty was. second, as the
head of a foreign (tower to respect the
independence of Mexico, to refrain
from all Interference with her internal
affairs, from all attempt at domina
tion except as he was justified by the
law of nations for the protection of
American rights. The president of the
United States failed to observe either
of those duties. He deliberately aban
doned them both and followed an en
tirely different and inconsistent pur
pose. lie intervened in Mexico to aid
one faction in civil strife against an
other. He undertook to pull down
Iluerta and set Carnmza up in his
place. Arms and munitions of war
were freely furnished to the northern
forces and withheld from Iluerta
Finally the president sent 8ur army
and navy to invade Mexico and cap
ture its great seaport. Vera Cruz, and
hold it and throttle Mexican commerce
until Iluerta fell.
Americans Outraged In Mexico.
The government of the United States
intervened in Mexico to control the in
ternal affairs of that independent coun
try and to enforce the' will of the
American president in those affairs by
threat, bv economic pressure and by
force of arms. Upou what claim of
right did this intervention proceed?
Not. to ..secure respect for American
rights, not to protect the lives or prop
erty of our citizens, not to assert the
laws of nations, not to compel ouserv
ance of the law of humanity. On the
contrary, Iluerta's was the only power
in Mexico to which appeal could be
made for protection of life or property
That was the only power which, in
fact, did protect either American or
European or Mexican. It was only
within' the territory where Huerta
ruled that comparative peace and or
der litcvailod. The territory over
whU'.! the armed power of Carranza
and Villa and their associate extended
was the theat.-r of the most appalling
crimes. U:r.!(ls of robbers roved the
country with unbi idled license. Amer
icans end Mexicans alike were at. tbelr
mercy, and American men were mur
dered and American women were out
raged with i : :unity. Thousands were
reduced to poverty by the wanton de-
struction of th? , industries through
which t!iv lived. Vet the government
of the United States ignored, con
doned, the murder of American men
and the rape of American women and
destruction of American property and
insult to American officers and defile
ment of the American flag and Jolued
itself to the men who were guilty of
all these things to pull down the pow
er of Iluerta. Why? The president
himself lias told us. It was because
he adjudged Iluerta to be a usurper.
because he deemed that the common
people of Mexico ought to have great
er participation in government and
share in the land, and he believed that
Carranza and Villa would give them
these things. We must all sympathize
with these sentiments, but there is
nothing more dangerous than mis
placed sentiment
When our army lauded at Vera Cruz
Carranza himself, who was to be the
chief beneticiary of the act. publicly
protested against it So strong was
the resentment that he could not have
kept his followers otherwise. When
Iluerta had fallen the iiew government
which for the day had succeeded to
his place peremptorily demanded the
withdrawal of the American troops.
The universal sentiment of Mexicans
required the iereinptory .demand, and
the troops were withdrawn. Still
worse than that, the taking of Vera
Cruz destroyed confidence In the sin
cerity of the American government In
Mexico, because every Intelligent man
in Mexico believed that the avowed
reason for the act was not the real
reason. The avowed purpose was to
compel a salute, to the American flag.
Three hundred Mexicans were Report
ed killed; seventeen United States ma
rlnes were killed and many were
wounded. At that very time Mr. Bry
an, with the president's approval, was
signing treaties with half the world
agreeing that if any controversy should
arise it should be submitted to a Joint
commission and no action should b
taken until after a full year had elaps
ed. This controversy, slight as it was,
arose on the 9th of April, and on the
21st of the same month Vera Cru
was taken. With the occupation of
Vera Cruz the moral power of the
United States In Mexico ended. We
M ,, -
I our
f anfl taiIun, to protect
the lives an I righis of our citizens. No
flag Is so (ii.s'H'i.iiicii und no citizenship
so little worth t!u claiming in Mexico
as ours. Ami tlmt Is why we have
failed in Mexico.
Policy of "Watchful Waiting."
Incredible as it se-.':i,s. Iluerta had
been turned out by the assistance of
the American government without any
guaranties from the men who were to
be set up in bis place, nnd so the mur
dering and burning and ravishing have
gone on to this day. After Huertn
had faileu and the Vera Cruz expedi
tion had been withdrawn President
Wilson announced that no one was
entitled to interfere in the affairs of
Mexico; that she was entitled to settle
them herself. lie disclaims all re
sponsibility for what happens in Mex
ico and contents himself with a pol
icy of watchful waiting. And for the
death and ontrage. the suffering and
ruin of our own brethren, the hatred
and contempt for our country and the
dishonor of our name In that land the
administration at Washington shares
responsibility with the inhuman brutes
with whom it made common cause.
When we turn to the adminlstra
tlon's conduct of foreign affairs inci
dent to the great war in Europe we
cannot fail to perceive that there Is
much dissatisfaction among Ameri
cans. Dissatisfaction is not in ttseir
ground for condemnation. The situ
ation created by the war has been diffl
cult and trying. Much of the corre
spondeuce of the state department.
especially since Mr. Lansing took
oharge, has been characterized by ac
curate learning and skillful statement
of specific American rights.
Three Errors In European Policy.
A study of the administration's pol
icy toward Europe since July. 1914.
reveals three fundamental errors: First.
the lack of foresight to make timely
provision for backing up American di
piomacy by actual or assured military
and naval force: second, the forfel
ture of the world's respect for our as
sertlon of rights by pursuing the policy
of making threats and failing to make
them good: third, a loss of the moral
forces of the civilized world through
failure to truly interpret to the world
the spirit of the American democracy
In its attitude toward the terrible
events which accompanied the early
stages of the war.
First, as to power:
When the war in Europe began, free.
peaceable little Switzerland instantly
mobilized upi.n her frontier a great
army of trained citizen soldiers. Stur
dy little Holland did the same, an I
both have kept their territory and their
independence Inviolate.
Great peaceable Aiuerlca was farther
removed from the conflict, but hci
trade and her citizens traveled on ev
ery son. Cvumtiry knowledge of Eti
ropean affairs made it plain that thr
war was begun net by accident, in: I
with purpose which would i.ot soon In-
relinquished'. Ordinary knowledge of
military events made It plain from the
moment when the tide of German lnvii
sion turned from the batue of th.
Marne that the conflict was certain tc
be long and desperate. Ordinary knowl
edge of history of our own history
during the Napoleonic wars made li
plain that in that conflict neutral rights
would be worthless unless powerfully
maintained.
The Democratic government at Wash
ington did not see it Others saw it.
and their opinions found voice, Mr
Gardner urged it, Mr. Lodge urged it,
Mr. Stimsou urged it, Mr. Roosevelt
urged It, but their argument and ur
gency were ascribed to political mo
tives, and the president described them
with a sneer as nervous' and excited
Wilson Has Shifted Ground.
But the warning voices would not be
stilled. The opinion that we ought no
longer to remain defenseless became
public opinion. Its expression grew
more general and insistent, and finally
the president not leading, but follow
Ing, has shifted his ground, has revers
ed his position and asks the country to
prepare against war. God grant thai
he be not too late. But the Democrat
ic party has not shifted its ground. A
large part of its members In congress
are endeavoring now to sidetrack the
movement for national preparedness
to muddle it by amendment and turn
it into channels which will produce the
least possible result in the increase of
national power of defense. What
sense of effectiveness in this effort can
we gather from the presence of .Tose
phus Daniels ut the most critical post
of all the head of the navy depart
ment when we see that where
preparation has been possible It ha?
not been made, when we see that con
struction of warships already author
ized has not lieen pressed and in some
cases after long delay has not even
been begun?
If an increase of our country's power
to defend Itself against aggression is
authorized by the present congress It
must .be largely through Republican
votes, because all the traditious and
convictions of that party are for no
tional power and duty and honor. .
As to the policy of threatening words
without deeds:
When Germany gave notice of her
purpose to sink merchant vessels on
the high seas without safeguarding the
lives of innocent passengers our gov
eminent on the 10th of February one
year ago informed Germany In unmis
takable terms that in attacking and
sinking vessels of the United States
and In destroying the lives or American
citizens lawfully traveling upon mer
chant vessels of other countries she
would act at her peril. They pledged
the nower and courage of America,
with ber hundred million peop'e nd
her vast wealth, to the protection of
her citizens, as during all her history
through the days of her youth and
weakness she bad protected them.

REFUSE LIQUOR ADS
Recent Siwey Siisws Some
Surprising Results.
Topeka, Kan. (Special.) A total
of 840 Amcraa daiiv newspapers
published in tht Knsiish language do
dine liquor advertising, according to
a nlnveslisaUon by the Temperance
Society of the M. 13. churcn, with
headquarters, here. This inquiry was
directed only to the daily newspapers
cf, the country. There are several
t'mes as many weekly newspapers as
tally publications and a large propor
tion of the weekly newspapers do not
use liquor advertisements.
A large number of papers report
that they are considering a change of
policy which will make their adver
tising columns dry. They are only
v.aitin,j until present contracts expire.
The states of Washington, Oregon,
Oklahoma, Wet;t Virginia. North Da
kota, Colorado and Maine have anti
liquor advertising laws now in effect,
while Georgia, South Carolina, Vir
ginia and Mississippi have enacted
fcuch laws but are not yet in effect.
In Ohio sixty daily newspapers re
port that they do not use liquor ad
vertisements. A number that do not
publish such advertisements did not
leport.
MILK DISPLACES BEER
Employes of Milwaukee Electric Rail
way Switch Their Drink.
It looks as if milk, not beer, will
make Milwaukee famous
Writing to the Scientific Temper-
f.nce Journal, Mr. Burt Hall, welfare
secretary of the Milwaukee Electric
Railway and Light company, tells how
milk is now being used by the com
pany's employes in place of beer. It
was the habit of a number of the men
to drink beer as a beverage with their
noonday meal. The company invited
a milk man to negotiate with the men
end to supply them with milk. He
made a proposition that if the men
would increase the number of pint3 of
milk used per day to 100 pints or over,
he would reduce the price from 3
cents to 2V2 cents per pint.
It was not long until between 300
and 400 pint bottles of milk bad taken
the place f.f an equal number of bot
tles of beer. The employes worked
out the problem satisfactorily to them
selves and all agreed that a milk diet
is far superior to a beer diet.
THE KANSAS DEATH RATE
Official Explains Why It Is Lowe"
Than That of Any Other State.
The death rate in Kansas is the
lowest of any state in the Union, 9.S
to each 1,000 population. The director
of the United States census inquired
of W. J. Deacon, registrar of the Kan
Gas vital statistics bureau, why the
death rate in Kansas is so low. Mr.
Deacon replied:
"Because the people do not drink
liquor, because they have money
enough to live right, and because they
have the Intelligence to read of the
conditions that make for short lives
end know how to dodge tham. Be
cause of the absence of the barroom,
our growing young men find more
I'ealthful pastimes than loafing In an
elsohol-laden atmosphere."
DESTRUCTIVE ALCOHOL
Southern Ohio Physician Tells Why
He Always Votes Dry.
One of the most eminent men in the
medical profession in southern Ohio
is Dr. Robhins of Chillicothe. In an
address in that city Dr. Robbins told
why he would vote dry at every wet
and dry election.
"Of all the drugs known to medi
cine, nothing leaves its impress on the
tody in a more destructive way than
alcohol. Nothing sinks the temple of
God Into lower depths. While cocaine
and morphine strip a man of all re
spect, nevertheless the microscope
can detect very little physical change
from their use, but alcohol not only
destroys the soul and mind, but body
as -well."
TRACED TO DRINK
Liquor Responsible For Most of Cases
In Columbus Criminal Court.
Columbus, O. (Special.) In the
criminal division of the municipal
court of this city during the month of
January, 352 cases were heard. Of
this number 125 persons were ar
raigned on charges of drunkenness
rnd 64 for vagrancy, practically all of
the vagrancy cases being due to
drink. This means that more than
half of all the cases brought In the
criminal division of this court can be
traced directly to drink. It is probable
that this proportion of cases before
the police courts in the wet cities and
iowns In Ohio are due to the same
tause.
