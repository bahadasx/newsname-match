: In commenting last week on
the candidacy of Geo. A. Harris
for the Democratic nomination
for Congress, we innocently
wade the statement that he had
no opposition in the District. We
have since learned that a Frank

Dwellings Duroed.
The dwelling house and a small
shop with all their contents be
longing to Thurman Strait in
Licking Creek township, were
totally destroyed by fire last
Monday night. These buildings
were situate on Patterson's Run
between the home of Maye Lake
and that of David Strait. The
fire was discovered about mid
night ly Mrs. David Strait who
sent her son to awaken Thur-
man's wife and three children,
and a daughter of Nevin Strait,
who were sleeping soundly in
the burning building and doubt
less would have perished had it
not been for the timely warning.
Thurman, at the time was sleep
ing in a shanty at the Lincoln
Highway stone crusher on Rays
Hill. We are informed that
there was some insurance on the
buildings.
About noon Tuesday the dwel
ling house owned by B. F. De
shong and occupied by Webster
Sipes at Andover was found to
be afire," and on account of the
unusually high wind, the flames
spread with such rapid headway.
that it was impossible .. to save
much of the household goods,
and the rest of the goods and the
house were totally destroyed.
Thi3 is hard luck as we are in
formed there was no insurance.
, The Evangelistic Services.
The Evangelistic services con
ducted by Rev. Sieber, of Gettys
burg, closed last Sunday evening.
The meetings grew in interest
and attendance until the last
meeting when the church was
not able to accomodate the large
number that applied for admis-
T-l 1 1 ft 1
sion. evangelist fcieDer, con
ducted sixteen services during
his stay with the result that forty-one
unchurched persons, sig
nified their wish to become mem
bers of some church, and they
will likely be received next Sun
day into the church of their
choice.
As to the finances, the loose
collections amounted to $91.00.
Of this sun:, $58 was paid to Mr.
Sieber, which, with the pers onal
envelope gifts, wil net him about
$200.00.
Rev. Sieber is a strong man,
and did good work. No one
could listen to his earnest talks
and not be spiritually strength
ened, unless his heart was wil
fully steeled against the Truth.
Even when an American sticks

There is not much excitement
here, except oil and gas. The
major part of this county has
been leased, and if the steel peo
ple could supply the necessary
material, we would soon be a gas
town. Three wells have been
drilled, and gas has been found
18 miles s. w. of town as the
crow flies one, a deep one, in
which a second sand has been
struck. Well No. 3 is reported
to be producing about 8 million
feet of gas per day; the other
two, 4 or 5 million. Lots of oil
west of us. The El Dorado field
35 miles west and 50 mile? south
west, is the famous Augusta
field. A Star machine, owned
by a bunch of the Standard, was
wheeled out yesterday into the
suburbs of our town, and drilling
will commence soon. Two other
rigs, 10 mile3 west. We hope to
be on the map in three years with
a population of 5000 instead of
2500 as now, and to be classed
with the manufacturing towns
end, we will be, if we have pas
in the abundance now believed
to be.
Our farmers are discouraged
on account of the unusual late
ness cf the spring. On my
birthday, April 7th, we had an
8-inch tf.ov,', on the Sih and 9th
it was so cold that half-inch ici
was formed, arid it k feared that
there is much damage tto fruit.
We hope, however, for a better
season than for the six or eight
past, and that we may have more
use for ploughshares, and less
use for swords.
The railroad fever which seem
ed to break out in McConnells
burg about a year ago seems to
have subsided until temperature
is normal. I hope you may have
a' relapse and not get over it un
til you have'a real railroad.

State Agriculture Notes.
It is reported to the Depart
ment of Agriculture that the
winter has been hard on the hon
ey bees in various sections on
account of the many warm spells.
Despite the good prices brought
for horses at the rural sales in
many sections of the State there
has been a tendency of a drop in
prices, the estimated value being
$158 againstJ171 a year ago.
There has been a wonderful in
crease in the average " price of
sheep, lambs and wool in Penn
sylvania over a year ago and
there promises to be an awaken
ing of the sheep industry if leg
islation to curb the ravages of the
dogs can be obtained. Present
averages show sheep worth $6.10
per hundred pounds against $5.00
a year ago and lambs worth $8.50
a hundred pounds against $7. 10 a
year ago. Wool averages 28 cents
a pound against 22 cents a year
ago.
The New Railroad.
It takes time. Any project re
quiring tiie expenditure of many
thousands of dollars must be de
veloped with care. The McCon
nellsburg and Fort Loudon Rail
way began work a year ago.
One-third of the' grading was
completed when the work closed
down L' it Christmas on account
of rough weather and all debts
were paid up in full to that time.
A reorganization is on foot now,
and it is believed that arrange
ments have been perfected with
a Construction Company that
will go ahead and complete the
work, and have the road in op
eration by the close of Bummer.
Another Fulton County Boy.
We have before us a copy of
an industrial edition of the Advo
cate, a newspaper published in
the county seat of Logan coun
ty, Colorado, that has the rustle
of western enterprise and "get
there." Every one of its thirty
four pages is full of interesting
information concerning the coun
ty and its people. From this pa
per we copy the following which
tells something of a Fulton Coun
ty boy who cast his lot with the
people of Logan county, Colo.,
and has had no reason to regret
it.
The Advocate says:
"In treating of the town of
Crook, in the eastern end of Lo
gan county, too much emphasis
cannot be laid on the important
relationship of Crook to one of
its citizens, namely E. A. Buck
ley, and of E. A. Buckley to
Crook.
"For nearly ten years E. A.
Buckley labored at the meagre
salaried occupation which he
went to Crook to accept while at
the same time he paid for and
built up the mercantile business
which now occupies nil his time.
It is this kind of devotion and
work that ha3 von for E. A.
Buckley the hip;h position which
he holds among his fellow-citizens
and won for him the title of
the most consistent, persistent
and loyal booster which Crook
possesses. It is th's type of man
which is responsible wholly for
the progress Crook has made.
"E. A. Buckley came from
Fulton county, Pennsylvania,
where he was born on February
23, 1S47. He a! .'.ended the com
mon school.; aid the normal
school and th:jn taught in the
Fulton county schools two years,
and came west on July 21, 1895.
He railroaded with the Chicago,
Rock Island and Pacific and the
Union Pacific as operator, and
engaged in the mercantile busi
ness in Crook March 10, 1901,
buying the S. L. Breckenridge
stock. This stock inventoried at
$1,000 and the business was con
ducted in a structure of small di
mensions. But embarkation in a
new business did not tempt him
to let go his profession of those
days. He continued as station
agent at Crook from February,
1901, until October 25, 1909. It
was then that he gave up the
railroad world; since he has been
devoting his time to the mercan
tile business and farming and
conducting the postoflice atCrook.
The stock of the Buckley Mer
cantile company to-day is valued
at $4,000 and in the handling of
the large business Mr. Buckley is
assisted by one man. and his wife,
the latter held by Mr. Buckley to
be his best aid. Mr. Buckley is
also a member of the school
board, and he occupies a promi
nent place in all affairs that go
for the advancement of the
town."
Logan County is situated in the
northeastern part of Colorado,
and it was organized only 29
years ago. Two years later, it
gave up territory enough to make
two counties and still has an area
greater than the state of Rhode
Island. It sports a hundred-thousand-dellar
Court house.
The present Clerk and Recorder
is Mrs. Una B. Wesner a na
t!ve of Ohio, and the office car
ries with it a salary that would
look good even to an Editor.
Fifteen years ago she went to
Logan County, after having
taught school in her home state
nine years. In 1912 she was
elected to the office of Clerk and
Recorder, and re-elected two
years ago. The office of Clerk
and Recorder in Colorado is one
of the busiest offices at the coun
ty capital.
. The County Superintendent of
Logan County is Miss Flora A.
Allison, a former Ibwa school
teacher. She went to Colorado
four and a half years ago, filed
on a homestead near Padroni and
taught in the schools of that vil
lage while the crops and final
proofs were ripening on her
GOOD WORK!
A Notoriously Bad Section of the Lin
coln Highway to be Made a
Boulevard.
Under the direction cf Super
intendent Kilmer of the State
Highway Department, work h&s
begun in earnest to resurface the
Lincoln Highway with Medina
rock from tl.e summitof Sideling
Hill mountain to the summit of
Rays Hill, a distance of about
three miles.
Since the days when the Cham
bersburg and Bedford turnpike
was built one hundred years ago,
this piece of road has had a na
tional reputation for being the
worst piece between the two
oceans. It is on a bed of Pocono
sandstone (the softest sandstone
known) and they have been po
konothin but sandstone on it ever
since it was first built, with the
result that the more they repair
ed it, the deeper became the
sand. When the Glidden tour
ists passed over it a few years
ago, the City newspapers gave it
a notoriety that had much to do
with warning travelers against
its use. That it is now to be con
verted into a veritable boulevard
will be joyous news to tourists,
for the watershed over which
it passes affords most magnifi
cent scenery.
J. A. S.
Limits Use of Fuuds.
In an opinion filed last Friday,
supplemental to one handed over
earlier in the week relative to
construction and maintenance of
state aid roads and state high
ways, Deputy Attorney General
Keller holds that the state high
way commipsioner cannot build
state-aid roads in townships on
state highway routes. Earlier in
the week he held that state-aid
funds cannot be used on state
highway routes in boroughs.
He holds that counties, bor
oughs and townships, under the
act of 1913 may contribute to the
cost of reconstruction and im
provement of state highways in
the same manner as provided for
state-aid roads. In such cases,
he holds that the entire cost of
maintenance and repair must be
paid by the state, and that the
state's share in such construction
and the maintenance cost must
be paid out of the state highway
funds as distinguished from the
state-aid funds.
His opinion establishes a line
of procedure which will be fol
lowed throughout the remainder
of the appropriation year.
Profitable in Chester County.
Chester County, Pennsylvania,
is considered one of the best
farmed counties in the United
States. When the U. S. Depart
ment of Agriculture wanted to
determine the value of intensive
as compared with extensive farm
ing, Chester county was select
ed. The survey shows that the
crop yield produced by intensify
ing the farming process rises
along with the labor income up
f to a certain point. Loss through
intensiveness does not occur on
many Chester County farms.
Most of the losses arise from too
small yields, The survey also
shows that crop yields may be
increased by intensive methods
to a point about 40 percent high
er than the Chester County aver
age before intensifying ceases to
be profitable.

What Dues It Cost to Produce
a Quart of Milk?
Manufacturers, transportation
people and other business men
employ expert efficiency counsel
ors to strictly account for all
items of cost of production, trans
portation and doing business. L.
W. Lighty, dairying expert of
the Pennsylvania Department 01
Agriculture says that the farmer
can use business methods with
good results. To place the dairy
on a profit-making basis, Mr.
Lighty says:
"The farmer is a manufacturer
and should be a business man
and cannot begin too soon to do
some careful cost accounting.
In the production of a quart of
milk enter many items of cost.
The feed cost is the largest and
the next is the labor cost, then
follow the buildings and the cost
of delivering the milk at the sta
tion or creamery. The interest
and depreciation on the stock and
equipment is an important item.
Taxes and other miscellaneous
items, six or seven in number,
all help to swell the cost. Ex
perts at Cornell University com
piled cost figures obtained in New
Hampshire, Massachusetts, Con
necticut. New Jersey and New
York and found that the average
cost of keeping a cow a year
ranged from $107.67 in New
York, to $63.19 in Massachusetts.
"The New Hampshire figures
were obtained by keeping a strict
record of twenty-six farm herds
in a cow testing association for
one year. The cows were above
the average of the state in quali
ty and production. The average
cost of keeping the cow for a
year was $147.73 and the aver
age cost of a quart of milk from
these twenty-six herds was $.042
The New Jersey cost of milk is
the same and the figures were ta
ken from the work of the Agri
cultural Experiment Station herd
which has better animals than
the average on the farms. Con
necticut and Massachusetts re
spectively found the cost of a
quart of milk $.046 and $.052 the
figures also taken from the work
of the Experiment Station herds.
The New York figures were ob
tained by keeping careful records
of 174 farm herds consisting of
abont 5,000 cows during two
years. In 1912 a quart of milk
$.051 and in 1913 a quart cost
$.044 on the average.
"Here is something strange.
In 1913 feeds were higher, labor
was higher, cows were higher
and yet the cost of milk dropped
seven-tenths of a cent per quart.
Why this change? Invariably
when we begin to keep records
of the production of the cows,
the cost of production i3 reduced.
So long as we keep no records,
we keep boarders and not a few
robber cows. Let me show you
what the Cornell investigators
found in 1912. An average loss
wa3 sustained by the owners of
540 cows of $16.00 per cow, for
while the average milk produc
tion per cow was about 1,500
quart3 the year through. Cows
to make a profit had to produce
fully twice as much milk during
the year.
"Wherever and whenever we
keep records of the production
of our herds we find from one
third to two-thirds of the cows
we feed are not making "iy prof
it and often we sustau consid
erable loss by keeping such indi
vidual cows. The most practical
most economical and altogether
the best way to keep these re
cords is by the organization of
cow-testing associations. At a
very small cost to the individual
farmer, a strict accounting and
record of production can be kept
of every individual cow in the
entire community. These neigh
borhood organizations have re
duced the cost of milk production
by nearly one-half in many com
munities. The Pennsylvania Department
of Agriculture will send a rep
resentative into any ' community
to explain the methods of organi
zing and conducting a cow-test-
AMBITION VS. HEALTH.
Little Talks on Health and iljgicne by
Samuel G. D.Jon, 31. D., LL D.,
Commissioner of Health.
The accumulated knowledge of
science regarding the workings
of the human mind d-monstrates
how little has been accomplished
toward cM'-'covering the rt'. ioii
ship between the physical and
the mental. It is, however, plain
to even the most casual observer
that the condition ci the mind
makes a profound impression up
on our health.
The intensity of life in modern
civilization makes demands up
on us in many ways thut aro in
excess of those which the mors
primitive environment required
of our forefathers. This often
results in a mental and nervous
condition detrimental to good
health.
We Americans have often been
accused by observers from other
lands of living under an intense
strain and struggling to advance
our financial and social status
greatly at the expense of higher
aims. It is unquestionably true
that ambition often leads us far
from the paths of peace and
contentment. Our National ideals
seem to lean strongly toward the
achievement of pecuniary suc
cess. In seeking this thousands
of men and women sacrifice them
selves and fail to observe the
simple rules of right living which
their intelligence teaches are
necessary for the maintenance of
health.
Those who plunge unrestrain
edly into the exhausting struggle
for great riches and power, cast
aside what the philosophers of
all ages have deemed most worth
while, the . peace of an humble
mind open to impressions of
the wonders and beauties of
Nature, art and the sweetness
and purpose of a simple life.
Simple Tests for Seed Corn.
Testing seed corn becomes
doubly important this year, ow
ing to the fact that last year
much of the corn failed to ma
ture entirely. Tests should be
made before the corn is shelled
and every ear should be tested.
A simple method is recommend
ed by the Pennsylvania State
College School of Agriculture and
Experiment Station: Two inches
of wet sawdust, well packed
down, should be placed in a box
about twenty inches square and
three inches deep. A sheet of
muslin of the same size as the
box marked off into two-inch
squares, numbered from one to
100 should be laid over the saw
dust. The germinator will then
hold seed from one hundred ears.
The ears to be tested should be
laid out in a row and every fifth
one numbered. Beginning with
the first ear two grains should be
picked out of the ear near the tip
two near the middle and two
near the butt, and these six
grains placed on the square num
bered "1". Likewise six grains .
should be taken from each of the
other ears until the germinator
is full. Then the corn should be
covered with a wet burlap bag.
If the germinator is kept at
room temperature for five or six
days it may then be opened and
the vitality of each ear determin
ed. An ear should not be regard
ed as first class for seed, accord
ing to the Pennsylvania Experi
ment Station, unless all the six''
grains from it have germinated.
The ears not indicating good vi
tality should be discarded.

ing association and even assist in
the organization, and free of
charge. Simply write your
wants to the Department of Ag
riculture at Harri8burg, Pa. The
cow-testing association will re
duce the cost of milk production
and put the dairy on a prcfit
making basis."
