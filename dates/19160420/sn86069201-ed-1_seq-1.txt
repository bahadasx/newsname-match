LOOK AT YOUR LABEL.
hverything thnt goes into the mak

In the last few months. And yet the

goes on charging the same old price for
his paper. It haa been said that a kind
Providence watches over imbeciles, but
for fear the saying won't hold good in
our case, suppose you consult the print
ed label on the margin of this paper;
find out how much you owe us and send
it in by return mail.
WALSMOMLINSON.
Miss Minnie Walsh and Mr. Harry
Tomllnson were married at the home
of the bride In Covington, Saturday
morning, at eleven o'clock. It was a
very quiet home wedding only the Im
mediate family being present.
The bride Is well and favorably known
here, she is n musician of ability and
possesses a charming personality which
will make her a pleasant acquisition to
uincasier society.
Mr. Tomlinson is a member of the
grocery firm of Davidson and Ton.lin
son, a capable, energetic young bus!
ness man and in every way worthy of
the bride he has won. After n short
trip they will be at home to their
friends on Richmond street.
TO OIL STREETS.
A paper is being circulated asking
subscriptions for oiling the streets,
The city will pay half the expenses.
the other half must be made up by pri
vate subscription. It behooves every
one to uid this cause and remember
both sides of the street receive the
benefit of the oil and the expense
should be equally divided. Dust is not
only uncleanly but it is dangerous.
As it shifts about the street in mil
lions of particles, does not seem to
have a very harmful appearance. Yet
when you go to looking into the nature
of it this same dust takes on a far
uillerenl aspect.
What makes up dust? A little of
everything is one answer, and one that
comes pretty near to the truth, taped
allp that dust found about the streets
of a city.
Dust in rooms is often nuite na for
bidding.
in an investigation or dust one in
vestigator using platea three and one
half inches irrdiameter found that in a.
large dry goods store in New York City
VJ'J germs lodged on a plate, while in a
near-by street, where the snow had
been cleared away, the dust that settled
on the plate contained 5,810 germs..

s TEST SEED CORN.
U you would Improve your corn you
must select and breed it as carefully
as your livo stock. The old habit of
picking the seed corn from the crib at
planting time never helps a fellow buy
an automobile. Let's resolve on hav
ing an ear-row test plot for at least 10
tars 100 is the right size after you
get real interested In this thing.
SPEAKING OF MONEY.
A wagon load of hemp brought to
Hudson, Hughes and Furnau last Fri
day; by Mr. V. A. Lear realized this
gentleman the total sum of $G48. and
it was not a very good day for hauling
harap either. Mr. Lear has recently
sold his crop to the above firm for 13
cents a pound and If h,e is fortunate
enough to have many loads like the one
we have just mentioned he hat struck
a veritable gold mine.

"CLEAN-UP" WEEK
POSTPONED TILL MAY.
The City Council and the Woman'
Club have decided to postpone the
Spring Clean-Up week till May, on ac
count of the continued cold weather
making it uncomfortable to work out
doors.
Plans are being made to have the-
moat thorough clean-up in the history
of Lancaster. The city will probably
be districted and the city wagons will
visit each district on different days,
-Tin cans and all trash that can not be-
burned will be carted away free. Will
YOU do your part? Begin raking-and
burning NOW.
WHY NOT BOOST
OUR TOWN?
The exemplary boosting campaign as
carried out by the business men of
Kroxvillein their visitation' of more
than forty-three towns in four days in
their special train only demonstrates
what men can do when they get to
gether. It is hoped that every town
in their itinerary, and especially our
town, may take on new life and enthu
siasm and get together us they have
never before.
We must be able to see the good
that is in our town, the possibilities
that lav before us, and get the Iutbit
ot pulling together. It is certainly
gratifying to note the improvement
within tiie past year in Lancaster in
this tvspect. Keep it up. Boost l.an-'
caster.
SUNDAY-SCHOOL
Is The Leading Factor In Cknrch Wotk
Today.
There are some Christian people, per
haps many more than wo aro accustom
ed to think, who. In theirsecret thought
if not in word, minimize the power and
influence of the Sunday-school upon the
lives of those who attend them. This is
due In large measure to the fact that
critics do not attend regularly any Sunday-school,
and do not require or en
courage the attendance of their children
and the benefits of it are neither within
their experience or observation. They
presume to judge within acquaintance
with the facts. In no department of
Christian activity has there been more
enlargement, or more Intelligent and
discriminative improvement in methods
of work, in selection and preparation of
teachers, and i.i the tools to be used,
including architecture, than in the mod
ern, up-to-date Sunday-school. It has
become the greatest and must produc
tive Held of mission-evangelism for
every local church. It is the field
"white unto tho harvest" right at our
door-step, abundant and glorious in
promise, and Is reaped nt a minimum
expense of labor, lime and money.
Sunday, May 7 has been designated
as a Statu Wide "Go To Sunday School
Day", and we hope Lancaster will show
up well on this occasion. Make your
plans now to be there.
While in town Monday, get your Seed
Sweet Potatoes and Garden Seed at
D. White Manse's.

Not How Cheap How Good.
To tell the truth we don't like the words "cheap groceries."
We much prefer to deal in the highest qualities obtainable. Be
cause reduced prices ALWAYS stand- for reduced values. It is
inevitable. Business is so regulated that it cannot be any other
way. So we talk high qualities month in and month out, and we
sell accordingly. No waste of materials Constant Satisfaction
Most healthful eatables Those are reasons enough.
