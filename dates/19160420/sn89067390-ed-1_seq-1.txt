The Tariff a Paramount Issue
The result of the primary elections
in Michigan and in Wisconsin have
excited no little comment here. In
fie case of the former, Mr. Ford's
luge surport is shown conclusively to
have come in large measure from the
city of Detroit where his own employees
are numbered by tens of thousands;
and the consequent result upon the
vote of the State, where only a listless
interest was manifest, is looked upon
as merely in the "light of a personal
tribute to Mr. Ford.
In Wisconsin, however, a far differ
ent interpretation is put upon the fail
ure of Senator LaFollette to secure the
full indorsement of Badger Republi
cans for his presidential aspirations
Not a few are asking if it means that
the Senator has finally lost his grip at
home. LaFollette's career in Wiscon
has beea one of steady manifestation
of power. From the days of his first
attempt to secure the governorship
down through his stirring activities as
an executive and later as Senator and
the leader of his party and as the domi
cant power in the State, he has never
failed to demonstrate his control
is remembered, of course, that he was
unsuccessful in his purpose to defeat
Gov. McGov-'rn in the senatorial pri
maries o! 1914 when the issue wa$

drawn between the Governor and an
adherent of LaFollette but it is also
recalled that a LaFollette man, run
ning on nomination papers, brought
about McGovern's downfall at the polls
and gave one of the three additional
Senators with whom the Democrats
have swollen their majority in the up
per house. But taken by and large,
LaFollette has of right considered him
self invincible at home.
This primary however, has afforded
the first opportunity to make a direct
test of his standing with his constitu
ents since he gave the only Republi
can vote for the passage of the Under
wood tariff in the Senate. Wisconsin
has felt the effects of Underwoodism,
in common with other States and it
is believed here that LaFollette's fail
ure to carry more than a bare majority
in his State this spring is in more or
less direct consequence of his co oper
ation with the Democrats in striking
down protection in the Senate. If
this conclusion is correct it emphasizes
to an unusual degree the extent to
which protection is lodged in the
minds of the voters as a cardinal issue
in this year's presidential canvass.
Facts are stubborn things and they
will prove to be exceedingly stubborn
obstructions in the path of Democratic
campaigners next fall. The record
made by the present National Admin
istration shows that in a 10 months
period before the war in Europe, and
while ihe Democratic tariff law was in

this country $174,600,000 worth of
products as compared with $72,600,
000 in a corresponding 10 months
period while the Republican tariff law
was in effect. This was an increase
of $100,000,000, or about ISO per
cent. These imports necessarily tend
ed to cut the prices paid to the Ameri
can producer. At the same time, the
records of this Administration show
that the cost of living in this country
was not reduced, but on the contrary,
was slightly increased. The producer
received for his commodities a less
figure than he would have received
but for the tariff reduction, but the
consumer bought goods at no less price.
' We did not wish an unwarranted
surplus, which means excesiive tax
ation, said Hon. Andrew mers oi i
the Ways and Means Committee,'
when debating the Democratic tariff
bill. Mr. Peters is now Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury, a position
which gives him ample opportunity to
inform himself that, under the law
which he helped to frame, we now
have an unwarranted deficit together
with excessive taxation. The law
blew out at both ends.
It is interesting nnd significant
to note the number of spirited contests
which are going on for election to the
Republican National Committee.
That committee this year is going to
conduct a victorious campaign and
many men are tnxious to have a share
in the good work.

Tom Taggart thinks that Governor
Ralston should run for Senator in Indi
ana, and the Governor thinks Tom
should try it. Fact is that each knows
that no Democrat is going to be elec
ted Senator from Indiana this year and
he wants the other fellow to take the
the odium of def'at. Meantime, Tag
gart will hold the office by appointment
and will enjoy being called "Senator"
for the rest of his life.
Hartford, Connecticut, is also tired
of Democratic rule and at its recent
municipal election it supplanted a
Democratic city government with a
Republican. Object lessons of this
kind are worth a hundred strsw votes
as proof ol the political tendencies of
this presidential year.
