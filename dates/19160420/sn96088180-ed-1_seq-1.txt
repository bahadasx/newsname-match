minutes today Ambassador von Bern

diplomatic break between the United
States and Germany. The Teuton

views on the steps necessary to make

ican -Ideas of law and humanity.
Although von Bernstorff would not

V comment upon the conference, It was
understood that be does not take a
hopeless view of the situation. It
Is known that he gave Lansing good
reason to believe that another dis
aster similar to that which befell
the Sussex will not occur while the
present negotiations are being con
ducted. It was pointed out to Lansing that
since America has asked for a dis
tinct change In the German submar
ine policy there naturally must be
numerous conferences ibetween Berlin
officials. , . '

today.
Marines have been ordered to guard
the wireless stations at Tuckerton,
"N. J., and Sayvllle, L. I., officials ad
mitted. This move la supposedly
taken to protect them from anti-German
demonstrations and to permit
tholr solsure lit case ot a break.
Much of the newt from Berlin is
received at these- stations.
Von Bernstorff Is obviously im
pressed iby the administration's ear
nestness. He bas fully reported the
situation to Foreign Minister von
Jagow In Berlin. If his mooting with
Lansing today comes before he re
ceives Instructions from the kaiser,
the conference is likely to bo tenta
tive. Germany's official reply to the now

DAUGHTER OF MORGAN
TO WED CALIFORNIA??
New York, April 20. The en

daughter of J. P. Morgan, to Paul
Pennoyer, ot Berkley, California, a
classmate of her brother Junius, at
Harvard, was announced, today. ( 1
TiTT
London. April 20. Well Informed
officials do not believe that Germany
will yield to the American demand
that It cease its present method of
conducting submarine warfare. The
opinion here is that a diplomatic
break Is certain and that war is a
strong possibility.
This view is based on the fact that
Germany has emphasised that the
submarine la Its most effective weap
on against Great Britain's starvation
blockade. Therefore, It Is believed
the kaiser cannot afford to concede
anything essential, though he may
poBslbly offer certain concessions,
hoping todolay events. ' i
The British attitude toward the
president's note ranges from quiet
satisfaction yearly to jubilation.
It is bolleved that the note Is likely
to influence other neutrals.
"It is difficult to suppose that the
Germnn government, elated by the
submarine successes of the paBt six
weeks, will accept President Wilson's
terms,"' said the Dally Chronicle, in
an editorial. "Diplomatic relations
between Berlin and Washington will
be broken off. The resulting situa

Russians Have Been Landed
at Marseilles and Are Now
Fighting With the Allies
on the Occidental Front
Paris, April 20. 'Russian troops
have been landed at Marseilles, it
was learned today.
The censor will sot permit the
number of Russians in France to be
made public' It is assumed that they
will either be sent to Verdun or to
some other sector on the western
front where the allies are possibly
contemplating a strong offensive. The
route by which the Slavs reached
Marseilles Is an official secret It
was assumed that plans for their
transportation were arranged at the
recent allied war council in Paris.
No news for a week has so electri
fied Paris as these tidings. News
papera publishing the censors' very
brief bulletins were eagerly grabbed
I on the streets.
Paris, April 20. General Joffre
addressed the army in his order of
the day today, sending his best wish
es to Russian troops transported to
France for the purpose ot fighting on
the occidental front.
This Is the first intimation that
any Russians were fighting on the
occidental battle line.
It Is not clear whether the phrase
"occidental front" refers to France
or Salonlkl. Anyhow, It the Russians
are aiding the French, it may be sig
nificant In view of recent French
complaints thst England has not sent
enough troopB to the continent.

tion will not be a state ot war, bnt

Commenting on' the situation,' the
Pall Mall Gaiette aald:
"The note's significance lies in the
fact that President Wilson is no long
er' able to withhold cognizance "of
the' true character ot the German
policy. America may be congratu
lated on the fact that ahe has reached
a point where she Is no longer com
pelled to wear the full livery ot of
ficial neutrality as between man and
beast."
"We don't exult over the prospect
of America's entrance into the war,"
said the Manchester Guardian, "but
we do exult in the prospect of vic
tory for the Ideals ot law and hu
manity. Whether Germany yields or
not, this victory Is sensibly nearer."
The (London Globe declared that
the United States was probably more
useful to the allieB under present
conditions that It would be it it en
tered the war.
"President Wilson has mapped out
a lino of action which admits of no
retreat," declared the Westminster
Gosette.

NOTE TO GERMANY
Paris, April 20. President Wil
son's strong stand on the submarine
issue with Germany won instant 'and
unanimous approval In Paris. It
over-shadowed the Verdun battle.
The portion referring to the princi
ples of humanity was applauded as
one of the finest' utterances heard in
any capital since the war began. '
Newspapers held 1 that' German
agents were responsible-for at least
part of" the ' president's Mexican
troubles1. ' Thes masses' are' beginning
to understand the difficulties' which
hare confronted Wilsonl They were
first disappointed at hls apparent in
difference to submarine outrages.
Now, his determination not to yield
an inch to Germany has wiped oat
the earlier Impressions.
