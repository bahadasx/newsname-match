SAN ANTONIO, Tex., April 2u.
That American tro ips wero ambushed
by Mexicans while passing through
Itachlnova last week was revealed in
a report to-day from (ten. I'ernhlng to
Major Gen. Funston.
A detachment commanded by Major
Mowze was attacked by citizens from
the rear of Bachineva, after having
passed through that town, said Gen.
Funston. Major Mowze was unable
to punish tho offendeis owing to the
conditions governing the expedition's
conduct. Gen. I'ershlng stilted lie
had "ample evidence against one
Mexican." Other details were not
given out by Gen. Funston.
1'iTEhlng's report, Gen. Funston
said, revealed Insi.inces of hostility
by Carrnnzistns. It was mailed from
Satevo last Saturday.
All the expeditionary troops are
now north of Satevo, Funston said.
In this connection he gave out a por
tion of Pershing's report describing
conditions south of that point and
declaring further campaigning Im
possible under present plans. Kvon
natives nre starving. Amer'ivm
tioopt, Pershing said, suffer from a
scarcity of water-
The punitive expedition will re
main at a standstill until Chief of
Staff Scott authorizes a change of
plans to bo proposed by Gen, Fun
Mon at their conference Saturday
and Sunday.

a cavalry troop located the camp of
(hindelario Cervantes, a Villa lieu
tenant, in tho mountains somo miles
from camp. Apparently Cerrantes's
outposts wero able to give him word
of the American approach, and he
escaped, Seven horses were taken in

this morning.
Tho strikers of tho National Con

had matters their own way, did nut
rather In their usual numbers thin

dered to Hastings yesterday.
Tho rioters Jeered, crying, "!ets
see you make us," nnd threw more
stones. A skirmish lino of militia
men df ployed out of the g.ttes anil
advanced on the crowd. Most uf the
rioters fell back: 'but a few stood
their ground, apparently believing the
soldiers would not use the bayonets.
Theso attempted to push aside Fie
long keen blades with their sticks
Tho soldiers did moan business.
There wns a. chorus of angry and
frlirhtoncd yells, and tho whole crowd
except three followed tho earlier fu

One striker. Philip ChiUcora, was
so badly Injured by a gosh In his fore,
head that Mujor Glover had him sent
to St. John's Hospital, Yonkers, in an
ambulance. Samuel Iihoi-kl was
slightly injured lu the right leg, and
Charles Williams was cut on th
scalp.
Tho women among tlm rtrllterr
were particularly noisy In tho morning
hours, urging thtlr nnn to fight uiul
denouncing tho soldiers. None of
them stayed, however, to await thu
street-clearing charge.
After the bayonet attack militia
guards wcro placed at twenty-foo; In
