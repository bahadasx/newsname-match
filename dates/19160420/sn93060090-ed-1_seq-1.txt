A BOUT CHRISTIAN
NATIONS,
, Wc"ak the great men of. to
day. Those who claim to know
Christ. Where do you say that
there is a christian nation to dav
atid'-what pari of the globe does
it inhabit?
And in order to satisfy our
question you must find a nation
which has eaten ' their swords
into frfowshearaand their speara
into pruning hooks, and will not
lift up '- Bword against nation
neither Jearn war any more and
every man sitting under his own
vine and tig jtree where no man
dare molest or make a fraid.
And patil'you find this kind of a
nation we will have to say you can
not satisfy us inregard to Amerf
ca being a christain nation or
any other, joation who prepare
for war, when God said put up
your sword .And I will be a wall

Love worketh no ill to his
neighbor. The universal charity
of a Mason, is like tbe charity of
a Mason's God and his God is
the God of Love. Just the God
the christian man should have.
Just consider tbe extent of the
Love of God and thatonly accord
ing to his degree is the extent of
Masonic Charity, and should be
the christian's. In tbe broad cir
cle of tbe affections, of true Mas
on, encloses all mankind in true
principals. And so should the
christian. The Mason like the
God of love, looks thru station,
came, ana color and with one
wish of universal Good-will, he
wishes well to all mankind, So
should the christian. With the
compass of bis mind, 'he mea
sures and draws the square of
his . conduct, and with - that
square having honesty -provided
for his ownbou8ehpld, he forms
his duties - of benevolence and
Charity to the distressed of all
mankind. So should the chris

A Bill For Coast De
fence of $100,000,000.
We learn on April 12 -The third
great element of the national
preparedness programme was
Monday brought into the house.
It is tbe largest fortifications
bill ever reported, and the first
of four annual measures under
which it is proposed to spend ap
proximately $100,000,000 .for
increasing and modernizing the
coast defenses, aireadv,officially
declared to be superior to any in
the iwld, andJto supply an
ample store of reserve ammu
nition for theifuns.
Included the bill are provi
sion for mounting 16 inch
direct fire rifles to guard New
Ybrlfi Boston, San Francisco and
otbeir great tfties from long
range naval bombardment.
Provision is &i$o made for
In reserve, so they will have a
range, of more than 30,000' yards
or fifteen sea miles. No ship
could live within that distance of
the guns.
Tbe plan will add 16 inch
mottar batteries to. the . present
12 inch emplacements because
of the increased armor protec
tion of modern battleships. In
addition it provides for 1ft inch
mobile howitzers and 14 inch
guns on railroad cars to defend
points not protected by estab
lished forts-
