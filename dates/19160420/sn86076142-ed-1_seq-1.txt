clothes, and the lowest, class of people
spend nearly all of their money for

"The number of rolls of cloth need

woman in winter is on the average
about 8; the length of thread needed
to sew them about 330 feet, and the
number of stitches about 30,000. The
garments have to be made by the wo
man of the family by hand, not by ma

work. The women folk have to de

devote their time to such service is
tin-economical from the point or view
of the conservation of human energy.
