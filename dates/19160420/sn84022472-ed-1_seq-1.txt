army officers that should an -order

the Villa and other marauding" bands

that, American soldiers would be sub

sniping as they retire from Mexico. '
, To prevent such warfare -against
his columns, General Pershing is pre
paring to be in a position tp move his

BAGGAGEMEN AT
RAILWAY DEPOT
IN BRIEF STRIKE
Ask For More Wages and
Quit When Company Fails
to Give An Answer.
STATIONMASTER AND
CLERK TAKE PLACES
Men Return to Jobs on
Promise of Concessions
From New Haveii.
The eight workmen who handle
baggage during the day season at the
local station of the New York, New
Haven & Hartford railroad? went son
strike today for an increase in wages.
The men now receive $1.80 per day.
They ask for the same rate as the
baggage handlers at New Haven,
Hartford, Springfield and Providence,
about $2.10 per day.
The men went to Stationmaster
Peter Hunt and about 10 o'clock to
day ajpd presented their demand.. He
informed them he could not guarantee
any incraese until he had consulted
with James Foster, superintendent of
the Harlem River division of the bag
gage service, under whose" supervision
the local office is conducted, t
The strikers then refused to con
tinue at work and Stationmaster Hunt
notified New Haven over the tele
phone. An incoming passenger train
brought one of the clerks from the
railroad offices there and he and
Stationmaster Hunt unloaded the bag
gage carand pulled the big truck
about the platform' for several hour
About noon the stationmaster receiv
ed word that some adjustment would
be made with the men and they re
turned to work. They declared, how
ever,, that unless their . demands are
granted they will quit again tomor
row. The nlgnt men are in accora
with the action of the day men and
; a general strike will be called unless
the increase in wages is granted.
Martin Gibliri, depot baggagemaster,
remained at his post during the hours
the men were out. Many passengers
suffered Inconvenience because v they
wre unable to gt aggage or have it
checked. There "was delay also in
handling the mails. The strike of the
baggagemen caused considerable con-i
gestion and delay in handling baggage
and mail. Stationmaster Hunt has
been trying without success, for several
weeks to get two additional baggage
men to augment the nightvforce.
A number of vaudeville acts that
were to ' have opened at local theatres
today delayed . the programs because
their baggage ; was not delivered qn
time. x
The 'baggage handlers work in shifts
so that each puts in 10 hours per day
seven days er week. j ,
LABOR M TO
FIGHT STATUTE
ON BOYCOTTING
Graphophone Co. Workers
Can't Get Permission to
Distribute Cards.
' The forces of labor all over Con
necticut Will ,he directed this summer
in an effort to effect; a revision of
Statute 1296. which is being interpret
ed, here in a manner that places great
restrictions on things labor men have
always considered they were entitled
to do.
The decision of Judge Gager in the
Max Ams injunction petition was so
sweeping in its effect that union men
contend it prohibits them from urg
ing a strike-breaker to quit, even
though they hire a private
lot in
which to do the urging.
I Following closely upon this, was the
rerusai or me puuj vuv""'"1"6 'u
aiiow me Amru ilu
strikers to issue cards, calling atten
tion to a mass meeting, which will be
held Saturday afternoon.
This, the union men contend, is
drawing the lines rather closely. A
representative of the Central Labor f
union called the attention of the po
lice today to the fact that clothiers,
second-hand dealers and others are
allowed to distribute cards to men
leaving factories, but the police refus
ed to allow union men a permit. Two
men were fined this morning in the
city court for issuing cards.
As a result, f'steps will be taken to
get very competent legal advice on the
meaning of the statute. At the mass
meeting, which will begin at 2:30, it
is expected the matter will be discuss
ed at length. . P. F. Duffy, prganizer
of the A. F. of X.., will be among the
speakers.
The State Federation of Labor has
begun a campaign against the disliked
statute.
Meetings "have been - held iri other
cities- and plans are' being made for
other gatherings. (
-"The Graphophone Co. strikers' met
this morning. Jt was reported at the
meeting that inducements are being
made to the strikers individually by
representatives of the company.

NORWALK EDITOR
SUES WIFE FOR
'DIVORCE DECREE
Hearing on Picturesque
Writer's Complaint Held
' Behind Closed Doors.
Testimony of such startling nature
is expected in the divorce suit 'brought
by Editor Michael Monahan of The
Phoenix against An astasia Monahan
of Norwalk, that Judge Webb of the
superior court this morning ordered
the trial held behind closed doors. The
court named Attorney Samuel C. Shaw
of this city a committee to-hear evi

Monahan is well known in literary
circles and his magazine, which fol
lows along the lines of The Philistine,
has a. large circulation ar ohg those
who believe criticism against existing
conditions should be- made in an out
spoken manner. The editor with ' his

SPEIZEUERDICT
Claim Jury Disregarded In
structions of Presiding
Judge Webb.
Counsel for Local , No. 1., United
Hatters of North America, will file
a motion to set aside the jury's ver
dict in the suit brought against the
hatters by Nathan Speizel of Bethel.
Judge John S. Pullman and Attorney
E.'-.J. McManus, .who represent the
hatters, claim the jurors disregarded
the instructions of Judge Webb, who
ordered that a verdict be found in
favor of President . Samuel Carson
and William J. Herman, a member
of the local. ,
The jury found in favor of Speizel
to recover $1 damages and $1 costs
and said nothing about Carson or
Herman. Counsel for the hatters
will probably object to the verdict
only as it applies to Carson and Her
man. Speizel sued for $S.000. TTe
claimed his union card was taken
away - because he refused- to pay a
p-50 cent fine and that he was thereby
deprived of a chance to earn a living.
