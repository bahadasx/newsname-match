Strong Force Landed at

OTHER MOVEMENTS OF
TROOPS PROBABLE
Closing of Port of Archangel to All
But Commerce For Ruaaian Govern
ment May Indioate That Troop
Movementa Are Either Under Way or
Ara Contemplated—French Take Of
fensive in Verdun Regionr
A strong force of Russian troops
landed at Marseilles today and will
fight beside the French at the front.
Their arrival was recognized by
General Joffre in the order of the
day. They are believed to have
embarked for France from the port
of Archangel, the only port be
tween which there is free conumun
ication between Russia and her al
lies in the west. It is believed the
transport made a wide sweep out in
the north Atlantic to avoid the
submarine zone.
In this connection it is to be
noted that word was received in
New York today thru private cable
advices that Russia had closed the
port of Archangel to all but gov
ernment traffic. This may indicate
that other troop movements from
Archangel to the west front are
either under way or in contempla
tion.
The French again have taken the
offensive in the Verdun battle and
In attacks against the German lines
on the right bank of the Meuse,
Paris declares, have captured por
tions of German trenches and have
takein several hundred jiriaoners.
According to a London dispatch,
the British coalition government
has been given a new lease on life,
a settlement having been reported
in the cabinet crisis.
A plot of wide scope conducted
for the purpose of causing, a revo

Paris, April 20.—A strong force of
Russian troopa disembarked at Mar
seilles today. They are to fight be
side the allied French, soldiers in
France.
General Joffre welcomed the Rus
sians in an order of the day, saying
their arrival, was another proof of the
devotion of Russia to t)je common
cause.
The text of the order issued by Gen
eral Joffre follows:
"Our faithful ally, Russia, whose
armies already are .lighting against
Germany, Austria and Turkey, wanted
to., give Franco further assurance of
her friendship more striking proof of
her devotion to the common cause.
"Russian soldiers, chosen from the
bravest in her armies, have come to
.fight in our rahks. You will treat them
like brothers. .You will show them the
warm sympathy you feel in their com
ing to fight by our side. In the name
of the army I welcome the officers, un
der officers and soldiers who have
arrived in France. I bow before the
Russian flags on which there will soon
be inscribed the glorious names of our
victories,"
French Troopa Take Offensive.
Paris, April 20.—French troops took
the offensive last night in the Verdun
region on the right bank of the IMeuse.
The war office announcement says that
captured part, of German trenches in
cluded a prominent redoubt. They
took several hundred prisoners.
French, resistance in the region of
Verdun is compelling' the German gen
eral staff to withdraw large forces
from the Teutonic front in 'Macedonia,
Serbia and 'Russia, according to' the
highest military authorities here.
The first division of the first Ger
man army corpa and another division
not Yet identified are said to be among
the troops brought /rom other fronts.
The Eighteenth army corps and a
Bavarian division, it la declared, have
been brought from the east.

GERMANS FEAR RUSSIAN8.
Have Great Respect For Strategy and
Cunning of Slav Soldiers.
[Correspondence of Associated Press.!
Pinsk, Russia, April 4.—Though the
average German soldier has the high
est respect for the fighting qualities of
his English and French opponents lt -un
is the Russian. accordlnK to officers I f™heUauth»rltle8
stationed in the East, who employs
strategy and cunning to an unex-^
ampled degree. There are almost as
many stories of Rurrian cleverness go
ing the rounds as there are officers who
have met with it.
In the great German drive eastward,
according to Lieutenant von 1
the Germans and Russians finally took
up their positions respectively on tire
west and east banka of a river. The
Russians were not taking their de
feats with equanimity, ana on every
possible occasion were disposed to de
velop counter offensive movements.
Thru underground channels the
Germans learned that the Russians
intended at night, to recross the
brldg# which, undestroyed, spanned
the river, and attempt to surprise their
rivals. The Germans in consequence
very carefully and quietly destroyed
one small' section of the bridge nearest
them, leaving a alight gap, and lay in
waif for the Russians.
The night was fairly dark, but not
ao dark but that the Germans coyiu
see as the Ruaaiana suddenly turned
a big, unharnesaed horae looae at their
end of the bridge, and with a few whip
lashes started him at a gentle canter
toward the German llnea. Puzaled

steadily toward them.
In a moment or two the horae
