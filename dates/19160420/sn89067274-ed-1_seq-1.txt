THERE are very few Democrats

Republican city solely because of a
quarrel among Democrats. But the
people of Kansas City are not Repub
licans at heart, and Jackson county, it
is confidently believed will show up
with her old-time Democratic major
ity in November.

THE MESSIAH AT HARDIN
Oratorio to Be Given Here Easter
. Afternoon in Auditorium.
Ledger Special.
Washington, D. C, April 19.
President Wilson at one o'clock today
went befor a jbint session of Congress
and announced to that body he had
sent a note to Germany Inst night; giv
ing the Berlin government irrevocable
notification that the United States
will break off n diplomatic relations
with them if the illegal submarine
campaign they hare been waging con
tinues. The breaking off of diplomatic
relations would be practically a decla
ration of war. , r . . . i, .. -.
The note was virtually an ultima
tum. Senator W, J. Stone of Mis
souri says he will move that the mes
sage be printed. It was referred to
the foreign relation committee to be
considered. '.
President Wilson's purpose in going
before congress is explained to be in
recognition of the fact that while the
executive branch of the government
has power to break diplomatic rela
tions, Congress alone has the power to
declare war, and the President feels'
therefore that it should be advised of
an action in which it may subsequently
be called upon to bear a part
Word comes from Hardin College
of the splendid work being done, by
the double quartet, who have in pre
paration the Easter Oratorio to be
given next Sunday, at four p. m. at

Victorious is a masterly work, dramat-
and forceful. It is apulse with
glowing color and movement; beauty
rules the theme throughout. Mr.
Hammond has concentrated into a
score which takes from forty to forty-
five minutes for performance, more
than most composers feel gratified to
achieve in a much longer time.
Those taking solo parts are Misses
Hurd, Bruce and Messrs Paul, Wagner
and Rixey. The second quartet is Miss
BiggB, Mrs. Wagner, and Messrs Sap
pington and Mitchell. Miss Sweeney
is the accompanyist
Dr. Green of the Baptist church
will conduct the service. A most
charming (feature is added an the
reading of "King Robort of Sicily,"
by Miss Dickinson of the College.
The program is complimentary to
the public and all are cordially invited.
