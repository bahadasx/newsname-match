Circuit Judge T. B. Stuart today

Fisher, auditor; Charles J. McCarthy,
treasurer and Charles R. Forbes, su
perintendent of public . works and
chairman of the public utilities com
mission, in the injunction suits which
Former ; Judge Arthur A. Wilder
brought several w eeks ago ' against
these officials. i ; ,'-
The Injunction, suits were brought
to restrain the territorial officials
from paying from the funds of, the har
bor board and of the utilities commis
sion the expenses charged against
these bodies by Superintendent Forbes
for his recent' trip to Washington.
In effect, then, Forbes is blocked
temporarily at least from getting his
expenses paid from the funds of these
bodies Judge Stuart also finds that
steps had been taken, by or. on be
half of these public bodies, to pay
the ' bills," bence territorial officials
are' blocked from bo disposing of the
delayed expense accounts which have
been the cause of so much discussion.
In rendering his decision Judge Stu
art gave credit to Judge Wilder for
having represented the citizens of the
territory, and brought suit to, prevent
the payment from public funds of the
expenses which Forbes incurred dur
ing his: trip to Washington. ; . f.i
