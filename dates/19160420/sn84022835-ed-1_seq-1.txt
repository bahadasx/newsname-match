Little Rachel Caldwell I
Is Called Home
1 p
One of the saddest incidents in the j
ecent lile of Ked Cloud was tint death .
of r.achel Caldwell daughter of Mr. ami
Mrs K. (5. Caldwell. Attor a brief ill-
tiess. in which the best medical sWIIlof
Ivaiisns City proved unavailing to assist
the little sitlVerer in her struggle for)
life, the sorrowing father and mother
brought home Iter lifeless body, Fri
day morning.
The funeral was held from tlio hnmo
of the child's- grandparents, Mr. and
Mf. I. II. Holmes, Saturday afternoon.
The two tnini.steis, ltevs. Myers and
Heel o conducted the services. The
rooms were tilled with llowers, the
beautiful tokens of the sympathy of
friends of (he parents Four young
ladles the .Misses (ierliudi, Ailani'-,
Greta Turnure, F.dith llotVman ami
Alison Cow-den bore the little casket
to and from the hearse.
There was no child of her ago .so we I
known in the city as was ltaehel. Shu
was so active, happy, bright, nmihlc
and Intelligent, that she was a joy,
not to her family alone, but to every
one in her neighborhood and to all
who met her upon the streets. She
whs the innocent expression of Life
and Love, glad of the all'ectiou lavish
ed upon her, and gladening all about
her witn its relicetion.
Our words are vain to comfort those
whose home has been made vacant.
Hut when the keenness of thoir grief
shall bo softened by time, the hearts
of the parents will Iind some solace in
the ell'ort of their hosts of friends to
share their sorrow The loss of a beau
tiful young life that promised so rich
ly of futuro benediction, can only bo
recompensed by tho faith that sho will
still minister to earth, when from
"flesh to spirit she has rison, with in
crease of beauty eliding her".
Rachel was born September 'Jth,
r.U2, and was .'1 years 7 mouths and 1
days of age.
