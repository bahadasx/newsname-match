Grant Permission
For Parking Space
The Chautauqua people have grant
ed tho city council permission to level
oft the land between Park avenue
and the creek next to Chautauqua
Park for tho purpose of constructing
parking places for automobiles. The
city attorney will draw up a contract
as soon 03 possible and tho work of
leveling the land and preparing for
the scores of autos which will be here
this summer will begin. Last year
during Chautauqua time the streets
near the Chautauqua buildings were
almost blockaded with cars at times,
and with tho prospect of far greater
crowds this summer on every big day,
all available space will be needed to
park machineo.
Mr. Billings and the council com
mittee which conferred with him rela
tive to making a trade for the land
on which I1I3 barn on Park' avenue
stands did not arrive at any definite
conclusion. Mr. Billings asked for
time to consider the proposition. If
the city secures the Billings property
it will own all the land between
Piel's plaza and the creamery property.
The Hotel Oregon property Is the
scene of renewed activity following
upon the determination to proceed
Immediately with tho construction of
a big annex to tho present building.
The big trees on tho easit of the pres
ent bu'ldlng have been cut down and
the land is being graded.
Bids have been asked for the con
struction of the annex, which will
cover approximately 147 by 40 feet
and be two stories in height. A roof
garden Is planned as part of the New
Oregon's attraction's.

Ashland Mohair
Pool Sets Record
What it is claimed are the highest
prices ever paid in the history of the
mohair industry in Oregon, were se
cured Saturady at the sales held at
Ashland, Brownsville and Corvallls.
All told some 18,500 pounds were dis
posed of, and the prices ranged from
42 cents a pound to 43 cents, the
latter smashing every known record.
The bidding was keen, several firms
submitted bids which they were sure
would carry off the pool. Everywhere
there seemed to be a concerted ef
fort to beat out one Portland firm
which has been boosting prices for
some time.
At Ashland the pool consisted of
12,000 pounds. The buyer was J. N.
Dennis, representing Theodore Bern
helm & Co., of Portland, he paying
42.55 cents a pound. The hair was
of fine quality.
Earlier in the day, the pool of 60
fleeces, or some 3000 pounds, at Cor
Tallis had been disposed of to Will
iam Brown & Co., of Salem, at a rec
ord price of 43 14 cents a pound. Like
the Ashland pool, this hair was also
of fine quality and was 'much sought
after.
The Brownsville pool of 3500
pounds approximately, was also
bought by William Brown & Co., of
Salem, at 42 cents a pound. This
sale was made about the same time
the Ashland pool was sold.
Considering freight rates the Ash
land pool really brought the highest
price. Freights from Ashland to Port
land amount to 90 cents, while from
Corvallls they are only 25 cents a
hundred. This was taken into con
eideration in the bidding. It is said
had the freights been on a parity, or
nearly so, the Ashland pool would
have brought in the vicinity of 44
cents.
There is a report In circulation that
at Eugene a sale of a small lot of
fancy mohair has been made at 46
cents a pound. While there is no con
firmation of the rumor, it Is not gen
erally credited. It is known that one
local company was called by long dis
lance phone and told an offer of 46
cents had been made and they could
have it for a half cent more. Natur
ally they turned it down.
Mayor Johnson cast his vote In fa
vor of the ordinance prohibiting roll
er skating and coasting on the side
walks in Ashland at Tuesday's coun
cil meeting. Ho stated that while
personally he was in favor of giving
the children all the fun they could
have, he had found that the law gave
residents a very legall right to the
smewaiKs adjoining, and no saw no
way but to put aside his personal
feelings and vote for the ordinance,
This ordinance does not apply to
the streets, however, and children
may skate in the streets. The coun
cilmen discovered this fact toward
the latter part of the meeting and
will probably take action to prohibit
skating in the streets also, as the
danger to the children's 'lives Is great
er than any harm which might result
from skating on the sidewalks.
A communication was read from
the Civic Improvement Club which
asked the council to ltt the children
skate on the sidewalks.
The mayor stated that he hoped
that the passage of the ordinance
would provide a stimulus for the
building of skating floors for the chil
dren on the school grounds or else
where, and stating that he had been
told such floors could be constructed
at comparatively small cost. Several
of tho councllmen spoke favoring the
construction of skating floors.

The findings of the board of ap

which would accrue to the Arnold
property from the proposed new rout
ing of the paved highway up Billings
of Farnham hill have been approved
by the county court. The Southern
Pacific has submitted plans of the
undergrade crossing and a contract
to the court for approval. The con
tract will not be accepted until Attor
ney Reames has had an opportunity
to go over it. The railroad expects to
have the steel for the span over
Wrights creek here by May 1, and it
begins to appear that the paved road
up the hill will be finished before
many months have passed. -, f '

An Ashland lady who had been
undergoing a course of treatment for
some months at St. Francis hospital
in San Francisco under Dr. John
Galoway, returned recently to Ash
land and upon the advise of the
doctor 1b taking hot sulphur baths
and drinking Llthia water freely. Dr.
Galoway told her that he had looked
into the efficacy of the mineral wat
ers and had made a study of the ef
fects which might result from proper
treatment using the waters and paid
a high compliment to the therapeutic
value of the Ashland waters.
The lady was greatly pleased with
the advice since she had not men
tioned the subject to Dr. Galoway or
the hospital management. Dr. Gal
oway is one of the biggest physicians
and surgeons on the Coast, has an
enormous practise and has had the
advantage of European training and
experience as well. He is widely
known throughout the Coast states
and is president of the St. Francis
Hospital coporation.
Endorsement of the curative prop
erties of the Ashland waters, coming
in such a direct and unsolicited
manner from a physician of Dr. Galo-
way's standing, means a great deal
to the health resort ambitions of Ash
land.
This sanction of the Ashland min
eral waters and the direct results
which are bound to follow, that is,
the sending of other patients to Ash-
and for treatment, comes as a direct
result of the activities of the public
ity department of the Springs Water
commission, which has sent a person
al letter calling the doctor's atten
tion to the enclosed booklet of water
analyses and the properties of the
Ashland waters and asking hiB study
of the same, to every doctor on the
Pacific Coast.

Will Vote on
Irrigation'Blayl9
The Talent Irrigation district has
called an election for May 19, the
same day as tho state primaries are
held, for the organization of tho dis
trict and tho election of three direc
tors and a treasurer. Tho ballots
wHI read: "Irrigation District
Yes" or "Irrigation District No
Those who favor tho creation of the
district will vote yes, those opposed
no.
Tho election will bo held north of
Talent, on the east side of Pacific
Highway at the Junction of tho coun
ty road running east to Bear creek.
The irrigation project is being met
with an enthusiasm which surprises
even Its most enthusiastic backers.
The farmers of the entire district
look forward to the completion of
the project as a goail which must be
reached, and but little opposition has
been heard to the project.
But one voting place will be kept
open for the election and tho farm
ers In the upper end of the valley
who come within the district confines
will have to travel quite a distance to
register their vote, but the Interest
taken assures a full vote.
A favorable vote on the irrigation
proposition will mean the beginning
of plans which will result in approx
imately $900,000 being turned loose
In the Ashland district, most of it
going to laboring men.
At Tuesday evening's council meet
ing a petition from the Civic Im
provement Club was read asking that
the council work with them In secur
ing land for tho erection of a club
house, Several pieces of land have
been (suggested, among the most fa
vorable mentioned being a site on tho
land on the west side of Park avenuo
opposite the park, which was recently
purchased by the city. The ladies
have asked the council to arrange a
lease or deed for a sufficient amount
of land to build a c'ub house and ten
nis court. The club has not arrived
at any definite conclusion regarding
the financing of the building, but
with their well-known propensity for
netting what they go alter will no
doubt have a beautiful home of their
own before long.
No definite action wns taken by
tho council Tuesday night, tho peti
tion being lost tdght of In an argu
ment over execnthe seslon. It will
be brought up a;:nin at the next meet
ing, the council in the meanwhile In
vest'gnting the various phases of tho
proposition.

C. A. Malone, formerly manager of
the California-Oregon Power com
pany's Ashland system prior to the
present system going Into effect, and
captain of the Ashland Coast Artil
lery Corps company, has accepted the
responsible position of purchasing
agent for the California-Oregon com
pany and will leave Ashland next
week to make his home in Oakland,
having business headquarters In San
Francisco. He returned the first of
the week from a visit to the head
offices at San Francisco where he
received his new appointment.
Those who have been associated
with Mr. Malone in a business way
realize that the advancement comes
as a result of his sterling business
qualities and are offering congratu
lations. Those who have known Mr.
and Mrs. Malone In a social way, and
nearly all of Ashland knows them,
deeply regret to lose two of tho most
pleasant people they have ever
known.
Tho Coast Artillery Corps hoys
will miss Captain Malone most of all.
Always a strict dlspllnarian, but Just
nnd "square" he tins won his way
Into the hearts of every militiaman
nnd has raised tho standard and
character of the Ashland company
until it ranks with the highest.
The California-Oregon Power com
pany is one of the biggest and most
substantial electric corporations on
the Coast. The company supplies
electric current for all of southern
Oregon and northern California and
Is constantly extending Its scope.
Mr. Malone's new duties will em
brace the supervision of all the pur
chasing for the company.
After tho usual routine business at
Tuesday evening's council meeting a
petition from residents in the neigh
borhood of that portion of C street
between Second and Third streets was
read. It devolved that the street com
mittee had already found a way to
handle a like problem on another sec
tion of C street and were awaiting
material to care for it. The matter
was referred to the street committee.
L. B. Sander petitioned for city
water for his dairy barn which is a
few feet outside the city limits, agree
ing to pay all expenses, stating that
good Bupply of pure water was
needed in keeping the milk equipment
clean and sanitary. The request was
referred to the water committee witli
power to act. Mr. Ashcraft stated
that Mr. Sander was contemplating
the erection of a new and up-to-date
dairy barn with ideal sanitary equip
ment in every respoct.
President Billings of the Chautau
qua Association asked that the city
take some action to protect the Chau
tauqua building from surface water
from Pioneer avenue. In 1911, ac
cording to Mr. Billings, an agreement
was made with the city to care for
the surface water In return for a
right of way for a drain. Recently
water has coursed down through the
building, doing damage. The matter
was referred to the streot committee
with power to act. Several other mat
ters were attended to as elsewhere
reported.
The electric light committee was
given power to put In lights In the
paved alley between Second and
Third streets.
The park ordinance was referred
over until the next meeting.
Some lots on A street Just beyond
Sixth streot, which came Into tho
city's hnnds from Mr. Ogg, will be
