BANDIT VILLA DEAD;
BODY IS EXHUMED
Persistent Mexican Reports Say
Carranzaistas Have Corpse.
VERACITY Of RUMOR STILL DOUBTED
Incidents Confirm Story of Blood
Poisoning Supposed to Have
Ended Outlaw's Career.
Mexico City Villa's dead body hat
boon dug up out of a two weeks' ok
Crave by Carlos Carranza, newphew of
General Carranr.a, tha first chief of the
constitutionalists, and is now being
brought by him and anrcscort of sol
diers to the city of Chihuahua. This
information was contained In a tele-
(pram received by the War department
late Sunday.
El Paso Francisco Villa Is dead and
his body, disinterred some days after
his burial, is in posssesion of the Car
ranza troops, according to a series of
telegraphic messages received in Juar-
ei Sunday by the Mexican officials.
For more than a week reports that
Villa had died from wounds have been
current both here and in Juarez. Sun
day's accounts were the most clreum-
stantial and apparently reliable yet re
ceived. They were accepted with re
serve by American officials, including
General Bell, but the Mexican officials
expressed confidence in their relia
bility.
The dispatcher of the Mexican West
ern railroad at Juarez reported to (Jen
eral Gabriel Gavira, Carranza com
mander at Juarez, that he had heard a
conversation over the telograjkh wires
to the effect that Villa s body was in
the hands of Carranza troops. Gen
eral Gavira notified Consul Andres
Garica here, who rushed messages to
tha telegraph operators at Madero and
Cusihuiriachie operators answered con
firmed the report and said the body
was being taken to Chihuahua.
The telegraph operator at San An
tonio, Mexico, 60 miles west Chihua
hua, telegraphod Consul Garcia that
Villa's body waa in posssesion of Colo
nel Carlos Carranza, nephew of Gen
eral Carranza, who waa taking it in a
specail train to Chihuahua.
In reply to ' these messages, tele
grams were sent to the Carranza gen
erals in the field and to officers in
Mexico City, Chihuahua and other
points, asking confirmation, but no an
swers have yet been received.
Apart from the telegrams sent here
there are some known facts which
have been pointed out by Mexican
officials aa lending strong support to
the truth of the report that the bandit
chief's career has been closed by death.
Villa has been suffering for more
than a year from a virulent form of
blood poisoning.
He was treated for this disease
while in Juarez by Dr. W. L. Brown.
Dr. Brown eays that the condition
of the bandit was such that even a
minor wound -would be fatal in ten
days unless treated promptly and with
the best medical skill and care. Even
under the most favorable conditions
such a wound -would be of the gravest
character.
Austria-Hungary Will Avoid :
Break With United States
Buda Pest The probability of war
between America and the Central Em
pires is a grave concern to Austria and
Hungary alike, for millions of Hungarians-
and' AuBtrians in America
would suffer considerably in case re
lations were broken of! and everything
is being done in the Vienna foreign
office to persuade Germany to evade a
rupture if possible. Austria-Hungary
insists on being consulted in the mat
ter and negotiations are going on be
tween Berlin and Veinna.
Should a break occur, the Aust.ro
Hungarian government will not take
official notice of it and even if it
should come to war between Germany
and the United States the monarchy
will disregard the alliance as a con
sideration, as in the case with Ger
many and Italy. The press is devot
ing marked attention to the situation.
Mary Phagan Suit Ends.
Atlanta, Ga. The suit brought by
Mrs. J. W. Coleman to recover $10,000
from the National Pencil company on
.account of the death of her daughter
Mary Phagan, for whose murder Leo
M. Frank was convicted, was dismissed
In Superior court here Saturday after
Attorneys announced that a settlement
out of court had been agreed upon.
Mary Phagan's body was found in
the pencil factory.
NEW CASES COME UP TO CLINCH
SUSSEX CASE; NEUTRALS WATCHING
Washington, D. C While President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing Monday
were engaged In marshalling the ac
cumulation of evidence that Germany
in her submarine warfare had violated
solemn pledges given to the United
States, official word of two more ship
ping disasters apparently due to illegal
acts by German submarine command
ers was received at the State depart
ment.
Consular dispatches that the steam
ship Margam Abbey was attacked
without warning on April 8, and that
the Aberdeen bark Inverlyon, with a
cargo from Portland, Or,, was sunk by
shell fire after the crew had been
forced to the small boats more than
100 miles from shore. Americans were
aboard both ships, and were endan
gered.
These two cases are being Investi
gated and may be Included in the
American Indictment of German meth
ods of conducting submarine warfare
which it was understood ' probably
would be ready for transmission to
Berlin early next week.
The President and Sercetary Lan
sing dovoted a large part of the day to
consideration of the submarine situa
tion. They had before them several
affidavits secured from American sur
vivors of the Sussex, and other vessels
recently attacked and documents con
taining information forwarded by the
British government
It became known here that the con
templated action of the United States,
which is expected to bring the sub
marine controversy to a clear-cut issue,
is being watched closely by the diplo
matic representatives of other neutral
nations.

NORTHWEST MARKET REPORTS;
GENERAL CROP CONDITIONS
Unless Houses Reach Agreement
Robbers in Autos Capture Six.
Spokane, Wash. Two masked high
waymen, traveling in an automoDtie
which they captured at the point of
guns, ran over a large part of the
South Side between Canno . Hill and
Union Park for nearly four hours Sat
urday night and Sunday morning.
They held up, robbed, assailed or muti
lated citizens, chased automobiles,
defied pursuit and concluded the
night's work with a profit of $44 and
six passengers in their possession,
among them a woman.
Shortly before 3 o clock the high
waymen reached the eastern outskirts
of the city in a futile search for more
live ones and disappeared.
Don t you want a souvenir? called
back the younger of the robbers to the
woman. A coin was refused, but a
cartridge was accepted.
Body of Lost Lad Found Near Trail.
Eugene, Ore. Lost in a snowstorm
after wandering for many miles in the
wilderness of Saddle mountain, the
wildest region of Western Lane coun
ty, Lyman Maddaris, aged 19, perished
from exhaustion and cold when within
sixteen feet of the trail.
His body was found Monday by a
searching party, which started out to
investigate a report that fresh tracks
of shoes without nails, such as worn
by the boy and very uncommon in that
section, had been found near the trail,
giving hope that the lad might yet be
alive.
Maddaris left the home of Thomas
Cullen, at the south end of Saddle
mountain, in an effort to reach the
home of his father on Big creek, Jan
uary 15.
Coffee Consumption Big.
Washington, D. C. The Ameri
can people consumed last year more
than a billion pounds of coffee, or 40
per cent of all sold in the markets of
the world. Germany is normally sec
ond, but ownig to the war, her im
ports have been cut off. France is
now second, but consumed only one
fourth the amount used in the United
States. The American per capita con
sumption is 10 pounds a year of coffee
and seven pounds of tea.
Washintgon, D. C. The senate late
Wednesday adopted its substitute for
the house free sugar repeal resolution,
extending the present duty of 1 cent a
pound on sugar until May K 1920. The
vote was 40 to 32.
Four Democrats joined the Republi
cans in voting against the substitute,
They favor the flat repeal adopted by
the house. A sharp controversy in
conference between the two houses is
predicted. Anticipating that the house
would insist upon its resolution, Sen
atora Lodge, bimmons and btone were
named as the senate conferees.
Unless a conference agreement is
reached and approved before May 1
sugar will go on the free list until
such time as the repeal or extension of
the duty can be made effective.
Most of the tariff discussion did not
touch on the sugar issue, which had
been discussed previously, but was de
voted to an amendment by Senator
Works of California, to increase the
tariff on lemons and other citrus fruits
to 1 cent a pound. This was defeated
by a vote of 44 to 29, Senator Phelan,
of California, being the only Demo
crat to support it.
Senator Phelan declared seven coun
ties in California comprised the whole
lemon producing region in the United
States and that the reduction of the
duty on lemons had caused a loss of
$800,000 in revenue.
Senator Vardeman opposed the
Works amendment and said, while he
would vote for' the senate substitute
sugar resolution, he would not give his
assent, to the house measure.
I would not vote to tax any of the
necessities of life for battleships that
are not needed," he said. "I have
very little sympathy for the prepared
ness program that seems to be agreed
upon, but if I had, 1 would not not be
willing to pay for it with a tax on
sugar, but would raise the money with
a greater income tax. an inheritance
Canada Opens U. S. Mail.
Washington, D. C. Several protests
have been made to the Postoffice de
partment recently by postal authorities
at offices along the Canadian border,
that American letters have been open
ed in the Dominion and passed on by a
censor.
No action has been taken, and it
was understood Wednesday to be the
feeling of authorities here that mail
in Canada is subject to such regula
tion as the Canadian officials desire.
tax and a much, greater tax on the lux
uries of life."
Senator Underwood defined the com
petitive tariff as a tax allowing rea
sonable competition and raising a rea
sonable amount of revenue. "I be
lieve it is wrong to tax a dollar out of
the pockets of one citizens into the
pockets of another." he said. "Our
tariff has succeeded in producing rev
enue and in reducing the tariff wall.
If there have been mistakes made on
some points, they have been mistakes
of the head, and not of the heart."
Senator Weeks attacked the Demo
cratic tariff, declaring it was not a
good revenue producer. He argued at
length against the contention that the
European war was responsible for the
great falling off in customs receipts.
Villa Leaves His Command;
Death Report Believed Ruse
Mexico City Francisco Villa has
left the main body of his command and
is hiding, almost unattended, in the
Sierra mountains of Chihuahua, ac
cording to information given out by
the War dpeartment Wednesday.
The latest of his retreating forces
passed through the town of Cusihuiria
chie, Chihuahua, in their flight toward
the mountains. They were closely
pursued by forces of the de facto gov
ernment, who hope to capture the
bands and locate their leader.
Rumors from several sources that
Villa had died of blood poisoning and
press dispatches from Queretaro tell
ing of an announcement by the de
facto government's war department
that it had reason to believe the bandit
chief had been killed in action were
the occasion of much discussion here.'
In some quarters there was a disposi
tion to credit the reports, but they
were without official confirmation and
both army officials and State depart
ment officials suggested that they had
probably been put out by Villa's
friends as a ruse.
Training Bill Is Passed.
Albany, N. Y. The senate Saturday
considered out of its regular order and

Slater bill to provide for general mili
tary and physical training for boys

Banker Expects Better
Business in Northwest
Spokane "Business generally in
Spokane and throughout the Inland
Empire and the Pacific Northwest
should show big improvement from
now on, and more especially during the
summer and next fall," said Aaron
Kuhn, a director of the Spokane &
Eastern Trust company, Wednesday,
on returning from a business and
pleasure trip to Eastern and Middle
Western cities.
It is reported in New York that
Germany has ample resources for fully
24 months," Mr. Kuhn said, "and it
seems to be known that the allied
countries are in a position to continue
for at least a similar period." '
Mr. Kuhn said that while factories
are busy throughout the big manufac
turing centers in the East there seems
to be a cautious feeling, with the re
sult there is little so-called plunging.
Another thing is that this is the
presidential election year," he added,
and capital is somewhat timid along
certain lines. There are some who be
lieve that a sudden cessation of hostil
ities in Europe will result in flooding
this country and others with cheaply-
made goods.
"One thing is certain: Our tariff
question will have to be dealt with by
the best business brains of the coun
try."

Gain Shown in Office of
Commissioner of Corporations
Salem With a decrease in expenses
of the department amounting to
$3737.89, and an increase in receipts
totaling $7364.88 for the nine months
of the current fiscal year ending March
81, as compared with the correspond
ing period of the preceding year, an
exceptional showing from the stand
point of economy is made by Corpora
tion Commissioner Schulderman. Mr.
Schulderman filed a comparative report
of the work of his office with Governor
Withycombe.
The report shows that the gross re
ceipts of the corporation department
for July, 1915, to March, 1916, inclu

corresponding period of the year be
fore the receipts totaled $108,938.82.

to nearly $5000 a year."
The department's disbursements tor

Josephine County Gold Mine
Property Sold for $175,000
Grants Pass The announcement has
just been made public that the Black
Eagle group of mining claims on Fid
dlers creek, in the Kerby district in
Josephine county, has been sold to a
group of mining men from the state of
Washington who will immediately de
velop and operate the property on an
extensive scale.
The purchase price of $175,000,
upon which an initial cash payment of
$30,000 has been made, easily ranks
the sale of the Black Eagle as one of
the largest mining deals made in this
county.
A concentrator of 60 tons capacity
will be erected at once, an electric
plant for supplying light and power
will also be installed, water power
being used to generate the current
The new owners are confident the
property will become one of the great

State Ships Flax Seed.
Salem In response to a request
from the Eugene Chamber of Com
merce, 858 bushels, or 20,000 pounds,
of flaxseed owned by the state was
shipped to Eugene.
Under the arrangement made by the
Eugene Chamber of Commerce and ac
cepted by the State board of control,
the chamber has agreed to pay the
state for this seed October 1, 1916.
The price is $720.
Checking over the flaxseed on band
at the penitentiary, it is found that
the total amount in the bins is 2235
bushels, or 125, 160 pounds. This now
has a market value of not less than
$2.50 a bushel, although it is being
sold to Oregon farmers for $2 a bushel.
On the basis of $2 a bushel, the seed
owned by the state represents an asset
of about $4500.
Water Scale Announced.
Klamath Falls Notice has been is

charge as becoming due March 1 of
the following calendar year, and that
each acre of irrigable land, whether
irrigated or not shall be charged with
a minimum operation and maintenance

Oregon has saved $1575 over what it
would have paid had the purchase been
made at present . according to State
