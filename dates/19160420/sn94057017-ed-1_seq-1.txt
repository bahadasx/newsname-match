ANOTHER SNOW
On Wednesday nieht of last
week and Thursday there were
showers of rain in different parts
of the county, but only light
sprinkles at Estancia. Early
Friday morning it settled down
into another old fashioned snow
that covered the whole county.
The snow melted so fast in fall
ing that the real measure of
snowfall was hard to gauge, but
had it not melted while falling it
would have measured ten or
twelve inches. It netted 1.28
inches of water. So a good crop
is assured again.
Ihe weather is a trite subject,
but nevertheless it is a very im
portant subject in this country.
and since last year was one of the
best crop years we have had, a
comparison of the precipitation
last year and this is of interest
Most of our readers under
stand, of course, that a mere
statement of tbe precipitation
does not necessarily tell all the
story, a or example, we have in
former years had heavy snows
that all evaporated, because the
ground was solidly frozen when
they fell, and remained so while
they ir.elted. This year we have
been very fortunate in that re
spect. With more than the av
erage precipitation, nearly all of
it has gone into the ground.
We will take the record from
Nov. 1 to April 18. The pre
cipitation was as follows:
Nov. 1. 1914. to Aw 1 18. 1915.
November. .25: December. 1.66:
January, .85; February 1.17;
March, 1 09: April 1 to 18. 1.58:
a total of 6.60 inches,
Nov. 1, 1915. to April 18. 1916.
November. .48: December. .89:
January, 2.25; February, .17;
March. 2.45; April 1 to 18, 1.68;
a total of 7.92 inches.
LOCAL MATTERS
OF INTEREST
THE STORY OF A PIG
This is the story of a pig. The
pig was a very good pig, and in
nearly every particular his ex
ample could be followed by all
other pigs with profit to their
owners. . Also the owners of all
other pigs may find something of
pront to themselves in the meth
ods pursued by the owner of this
pig. Ralph Stubuleheld was the
owner of this pig. Ralph bought
him November 2, 1915, when he
was about two months old.
weighed 37 pounds, the price
paid being $3 50. Ralph bought
some posts and lumber at a cost
of 90c, and added to this enough
picked up scraps to build a pen.
tie bought teed tor the pig at a
cost of $8 60 all told. This was
mostly corn and corn chop, but
included 60 pounds of split beans
which the pig declined to eat
The corn and corn chop was al
ways soaked. So, tbe total cost,
including tbe pen, and the beans
which the pig would not eat, was
$13,00. The pig was butchered
April 10th, and sold eighteen
hours after slaughter at 12 1-zc
per pound. It Weighed 163
pounds, which at 12 l-2c amount
ed to $20 37. Thus Ralph made
a net profit of $7.37. He gave
the pig good care, of course; gave
him plenty of clean, fresh water,
and kept the pen clean. The
pig got the scraps from the table,
of course, but aa there are but
thrre in ' the family and Mrs.
Stubblefield is an economical
housekeeper, this was not much;
but it helped a little. The pig
pot no milk. Now, we hope the
hovs over the county who have
joined the clubs that have been
recently organized, win tase
note of this. No doubt some of
them will choose to engage in
raising pigs, and Ralph Stubble
field's experiment will give them
some pointers. Where a boy can
get milk to feed a pig. he can
make a better net profit than
Ralph did.

fourth, the sad part. I have
got to leave one and all to go to
a new üeld of labor. We phall
