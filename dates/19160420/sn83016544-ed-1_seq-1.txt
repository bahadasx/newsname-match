OAILY MAIL ASSURED
Winger & Rohartson Awirdtd Cm
tract Frts Cramr to Hivlani.
On Saturday night word wa& re
ceived that daily mail would be a
fact after the first of May, and that
Winger & Robertson have been
awarded the contract for hauling
same. There was a feeling of doubt
on the question as to whether we
would get this service or not,~ as
some thought that the. additional
cost would be enough to cause it
being turned down by the depart­
ment. It will be a little strange to
have mail every day, but it will be
a great convenience to the people of
the county.
Mr. Winger left yesterday for
Duluth to purchase a seven-passen­
ger Overland which they will use on

A large number of our citizens hj|ye

lage in spots.
Cooperage Started Up.
The Cooperage Company has star­
ted making kegs and is putting out
about five hundred a day already.
The plant is putting out a good keg
this year and it would be a good
boost for the county if the fishermen
would insist on uping the home
product. As far as we can learn
their kegs are as easy to handle as
any, and better then some made
elsewhere.
The plant is a 'good asset to this
community, and the county, and is
a convenience to the fishermen along
the shore, as they are always sure of
getting kegs when they need them.
The success of the plant depends
on the fishermen, and it seems that
they could do the county, as well as
themselves, a great service by insist­
ing that the different dealers handle
the North Shore kegs.

HEAVY FIGHTING
AROUND VERDUN
London, April, 17.—The Douaumont
Vaux sector northeast of Verdun has
been the scene of another hard fought
infantry engagement, but the Paris
and Berlin official reports are at vari­
ance regarding the result.
Paris reports that south of Douau
mont the French troops in an attack
captured sections of German trenches
and took two hundred prisoners.
Berlin asserts that in the fighting
which extended from Fort Douaumont
to the Vaux ravine, and in which the
PTeacii attacked with heary effectives,
the French were repulsed.
The Germans are heavily bombard*
ing French positions in the Avocourt
wood and on Hill 304, and considerable
artillery activity also is being display­
ed around Douaumont and in the
Woevre about Moulainvllle, Haudi
mont and Les Eparges.
T|ie British report the raiding of
German trenches south of the Be
thune-La Basse road, while Berlin re­
cords the destruction of a British .po­
sition about sixty meters in length in
mining operations near Vermelles.
$40,000,000 RIVER
SILL PASSES HOUSE
Washington, April 13. The annual
rivers and harbors appropriation bill,
carrying $40,000,000, passed the house
by a vote of 210 to 133, with every
item as agreed upon in committee un­
changed.
Scores of amendments to cut down
items, urged by representatives who
charged that the bill was "a pork bar­
rel" measure, were rejected during
the two weeks' debate.
Just before the final vote an effort,
led by Republican Leader Mann, to
reduce the total to $20,000,000 failed,
200 to 149.
The entire appropriation, except for
a $700,000 item to deepen the ap­
proaches to the Brooklyn navy yard,
is for continuing work on improve­
ment projects already authorized and
under way.

creases in wages, which it is estimated
will total $3,500,000 a year, the

Pennsylvania signed a new two-year
agreement with officials of the United
Mine Workers of America.

A Surprise on Rev. Sandeno
Last Saturday evening a number
of the friends of Rev. andaMrs.T.G.
Sandeno called at their home, asking
them to come over to the church,
where they were met by a still larger
gathering of friends. The occasion
was Rev. Sandeno's birthday. After
they had partaken in a tasty lunch
which the ladies had prepared the
gathering was called to order bv
Rev. W. H. liipon, who introduced
the speakr of the evening, Dr. F. B.
Hicks. The doctor, in his speech,
told Rev. Sandeno that the asHembly
was a slight showing of the esteem
and good will of his fellow citizens
for him and his work, and as a fur­
ther evidence of appreciation he was
presented vvith a purse. Rev. Ripon
also made a short address, pointing
out some of the difficulties and qual­
ifications necessary for a successful
cI®rgyman.
Mr.
Spring is here gentle Annie! Here
some accept the crow as its harbinger,
bat the majority has abetter one, It is
the rustics "With the coming of spring­
time they leave the side of their lovers,
Reservation Belles, to grasp the plough
handle or the axe, and many are the
sounds that break the stillness. The
cawing of the crow, the chip-chop of the
axe, the whooping of the ploughboy
added to the roaring of the swollen
brooklets causes the most sluggish to
yearn to be close to nature.
The Farmers' Club of this community
held their monthly meeting April the
8th. It was at a late hour when the
desk was cleared from business and the

and the club. It showed to what a
wonderful degree the ability of the
club members bad been developed dur­
ing the meetings of the past. After the
program refreshments, consisting of
excellent sandwiches, delicious cake and
steaming hot coffee, was served. The
beautiful club dishes added greatly to
artistic showing. The debate was a
very lively one. Some good arguments
being presented by both sided. The
decision being rendered in favor of the
negative, against the organizing' of a
town of the unorganized district. Per­
haps the moBt in teres
tiug feature of the
program was the spelling bee. It
was the result of an effort to arouse
interest in spelling, not only among the
youngsters but also among the elders.
Mr. A. Ellquist proved to be a top
notcher being pressed hard by Mr. Wm.
Taylor who won second honors. Mrs,

time will arrive in the days to come.
