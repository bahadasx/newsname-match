CONGRESS HURRIEDLY GALLED
TOGETHER BY PRESIDENT TO BE
Continuance of the Present
Methods of Sub-Sea War
Will Cause a Break
WILSON POINTS TO
MANY VIOLATIONS
Says Promises Made By the
Kaiser's Government Are
Not Being Observed
Washington, D. C., April 19.—
President Wilson told congress, as
sembled in joint session shortly after
1 o'clock this afternoon, he had given
Germany irrevocable notification that
the United States will break off diplo
matic relations if her illegal subma
rine campaign is continued.
A note, America's last word, prac
tically an ultimatum, and demanding
an immediate reply presumably was
in the Berlin foreign office as the
president was speaking.
The president asked no action what
ever of congress. He simply informed
it of the accumulation of facts prov
ing that Germany's assurances to the
United States are being violated that
the submarine campaign, despite the
earnest protests of the United States,
Is being conducted -with renewed vig
or in contravention of all the laws of
nations and humanity and that he
means to sever relations unless it is
brought within the law. Diplomatic
history of the world shows that such
a course is almost certain to be fol
lowed by war.
The president's note and his address
to congress are final. They mark the
end of diplomatic exchanges. A con
tinuance of the long standing friendly
relations, the president made clear,
depends alone on Germany's conduct.
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
1 The president said:
"Gentlemen of the congress:
"A situation has arisen in the for
eign relations of the country of which
it is my plain duty to inform you very
frankly.
"It will be recalled that in Febru
ary, 1915, the imperial German gov
ernment announced its intention to
treat the waters surrounding Great
Britain and Ireland as embraced with
in the seat of war and to destroy all
merchant ships owned by its enemies
that might be found within any part
of that portion of the high seas and
that it warned all vessels of neutral
as well as of belligerent ownership to
keep out of the waters it had thus pro
scribed or else enter them at thefr
peril. The government of the United
States earnestly protested. It took
the position that such a policy could
not be pursued without the practical
certainty of gross and palpable viola
tions of the law of nations, particular
ly if submarine craft were to be em
ployed as itB instruments, Inasmuch
as the rules prescribed by that law,
rules founded upon principles of hu
manity and established for the protec
tion of the lives of noncombatants at
sea, could not in the nature of the
case be observed by such vessels. It
based its protest on the ground that
persons of neutral nationality and ves
sels of neutral ownership would be
"xposed to extreme and intolerable
\jsks and that no right' to close any
pi'art of the high seas against their use
\r to expose them to such risks could
lawfully be asserted by any belligerent
government. The law of nations in
these waters, upon which the govern
ment of the United States based its
protest, is not of recent origin or
founded upon merely arbitrary princi
ples set up by convention. It Is based,
on the contrary, upon manifest and
imperative principles of humanity and
has long been established with the
approval and by the express assent of
^11 civilized nations.
Protests of U. S. Unheeded.
"Notwithstanding the earnest pro
test of our government, the Imperial
Bptnan government at once proceeded
quarry out the policy it had announc
d. It expressed the hope that the
an In a an at an
ers to neutral vessels, would be re-1
uced to a minimum by the instruc
ions which it had Issued to its sub-'
arine commanders, and assurred the
overnment of the United States that
S-.- -f
Political Dodge?
Speaker Clark and Democratic'
Leader Kltchln declined to com
ment on the president's address.
They said they desired to digest it
fully before saying anything.
"The sending of a note to Ger
many was as mild a position as
the president could take," said
Representative Flood, chairman
of the foreign affairs committee.
"I think It will meet with the ap
proval of congress and the coun
try."
"I think this government
should be neutral," said Repub
lican Leader Mann. "The presi
dent never Has been neutral. He
has been on the English side all
the time. What he said about
Germany, while It is grossly ex
aggerated, Is a Just complaint.
But he could say Just the same
about England and our shipping,
substituting 'seizing, ships' for
'sinking ships.' It is a mistake to
break off diplomatic relartlons with
Germany. It is perfectly evident
that the president as a campaign
political dodge Is trying to work
up to a point where he can get
into a war with Germany during
a presidential campaign."
"If war comes out of this," de
clared Senator Kenyon, republi
can, of Iowa, "I hope the first to
enlist will be those who have in
sisted on riding on armed bellig
erent ships."
"The severance of dlplomatlo
relations rests with the executive
department of the government,"
aald Senator Sherman, republican,
of Illinois. "If this brings us to
the brink of war it is for congresp
to sustain or refuse to sustain
the president. I should vote
against any declaration of war
based on any such reasons as
those contained in the president's
message."
it would take every possible precaution
both to respect the rights of neutrals
and to safeguard the lives of noncom
batants.
"What has actually happened in the
year which has since elapsed has
shown that those hopes were not justi
fied, those assurances Insusceptible of
being fulfilled. In pursuance of the
policy of submarine warfare against
the commerce of its adversaries, thus
announced and entered upon by the
imperial German government in spite
of the solemn protest of this govern
ment, the commanders of German un
dersea vessels* have attacked mer
chant ships with greater and greater
activity, not only upon the high seas
surrounding Great Britain and Ireland
but wherever they could encounter
them in a way that has grown more
and more ruthless, more and more in
discriminate as the months have gone
by, less and less observant of restraint
of any kind and have delivered their
attacks without compunction against
vessels of every nationality and bound
upon every sort of ^errand.
Neutrals Made to Suffer.
"Vessels of neutral ownership, even
vessels of neutral ownership bound
from neutral port to neutral port, have
been destroyed along with vessels of
belligerent ownership in constantly in
creasing numbers. Sometimes the mer
chantmen attacked have been warned
and summoned to surrender before be
ing fired on or torpedoed: sometimes
passengers or crews have been vouch
safed the poor security of being allow
ed to take to the ship's boats before
she was sent to the bottom. But again
and again no warning has been given
no'escape even to the ship's boats al
lowed to thos*e on board. What this
government foresaw must happen has
happened.. Tragedy has followed trag
edy on the seas in such fashion, with
such attendant circumstances, as to
make it grossly evident that warfare
of such a sort, if warfare it be, can not
be carried on without the most pal
pable violation of the dictates alike of
right and humanity. Whatever the dis
position and intention of the imperial
German government, It has manifestly
proved impossible for it to keep such
methods of attack upon the commerce
of its enemies within the bounds set
by either the reason or the heart of
mankind.

Wilson Ponders
GENERAL SCOTT IS
HURRYING TO FRONT
Future Course May Depend
on His Report of the
Mexican Situation
Washington, D. C., April 19.—Maj.
Gen. Hugh L. Scott, chief of stalf of
the army, w*ll go to San Antonio,
Tex., tonight by order of Secretary
Baker, in order to get accurate infor
mation as to the situation pn the bor
der and in Mexico.
Secretary Baker issued this state
ment
"Gen. Scott leaves for San Antonio
this evening at 6: IB at my request.
He will spend several days with Gen.
Funston and return. This trip is
made solely for the purpose of getting
as accurate information as is possible
for the use of the department. Gen.
Funston remains in full charge of the
affairs of his department including the
expedition into Mexico. He has the
full confidence of the department and
his dispositions have the department's
entire approval."
Await 8cott's Report.
Secretary Baker would not discuss
Gen. Scott's mission beyond his for
mal statement. It was assumed, how
ever, that his report after conference
with Gen. Funston will go far toward
determining the course to be pursued
in Mexico.
It is known that Gen. Fnnston has
been urging the department that he
be permitted to shift his headquarters
and the border base in order to short
en his line of communications.
The department apparently has
hesitated to authorize any radical
change in the status of the expedition
in the face of requests from Gen. Car
ranza that the troops be recalled be
lieving it might tend to increase anti
American feeling among Carranza
garrisons. For the same reason the
sending of heavy reinforcements to
the border has not been resorted to
as yet.
Crisis Is at Hand.
Until the German situation is clear
ly understood it is impossible to fore
cast the administration's decision as
to Pershing's expedition. Military ob
servers appear to agree that some
radical move must be made soon,
either to back up the troops in Mexi
co or to withdraw them.
Gen. Scott is acquainted with Villa
and with many Carranza officials and
with his knowledge of the border and
the confidential information Gen. Fun
ston is able to supply he will be able
to advise Secretary Baker.
May Need Men Here.
The general belief here is that the
German situation would have some
bearing upon the impending decision.
Should a break in diplomatic rela
tions occur, it was pointed out that
the troops now in Mexico would be
needed at home as military prudence
would require that steps be taken to
prepare for eventualities in ETurope.
It was suggested that inasmuch as
the main purpose of the expedition,
the protection of the border, has been
accomplished, an agreement for the
withdrawal might be reached with
Gen. Carranza on the basis that if
Villa or his bandits again head north
ward American troops would again
cross the international line.
MORE TROOPS NEEDED.
San Antonio, Tex., April 19.—Head
quarters are awaiting advices from the
war department regarding the troops
that will be sent into the southern de
partment to replace the 2,300 orderel
from their stations along the border
to Columbus to strengthen Gen. Persh
ing's command in Mexico. Coincident
with his action in ordering bordor
troops to Columbus. Gen. Fuston asked
for outside troops to maintain the bor
der patrol at its present strength.
It was announced at headquarters
that overnight dispatches had not been
received to indicate any change in the
Mexican situation.
Upon arrival at Columbus it is be
lieved Gen. Pershing will use the re
inforcements to strengthen the line of
communication.
SOLDIERS CALLED
TO QUELL RIOTERS
Hastlngs-on-the-Hudson, N. Y., April
19.—Martial law was declared in effect
within the limits of Hastings village
and state troops were called upon
for duty today after rioting had as
sumed serious proportions among
strikers of the National Conduit &
Cable Co. A mob attacked the com
pany's plant with bullets and stones.

FINAL ULTIMATUM SENT TO GERMANY
GERMAN AGENT
DEMANDS RETURN
OF HIS PAPERS
DIPLOMATIC AND LEGAL BATTLE
WAGED BY MAN ACCUSED OF
BOMB PLOTTING.
New York, April 19—The papers
•sized by federal agents yesterday
In the office of Wolfe von Igei, for
mer secretary of Capt. Franz von
Papen, recalled German military
attache, will not be restored, neith
er will the prosecution of Von
Igel for his alleged participation In
the Welland canal plot be drop
ped, Assistant U. 3. Attorney
Roger B. Woods said today.
District Attorney Marshall said
that In addition to the papers seiz
ed bearing upon the Welland canal
plot there was also documentary
evidence taken "of extraordinary
Importance," disclosing other ac
tivities In the so-called German
propaganda in this country. What
their nature was he declined to
divulge.
New York, April 19.—Government
officials here faced a unique problem
today resulting from the demand of
the German embassy in Washington
for the release of Wtolf von Igel and
the return of documents seized in his
office when he was arrested yesterday
on an indictment charging him with
complicity in a plot to destroy the
Welland canal.
Von Igel formerly was secretary to
Capt. Franz von Papen, the recalled
military attache of the German em
bassy, which claims diplomatic im
munity for him. The embassy de
manded the return of the papers
seized in his office on the ground that
the office Is a branch of the embassy.
Seventy pounds of documents and let
ters taken from Von Igel's office are
in the possession of federal authori
ties. It was reported they were of
great Importance as throwing light on
various German activities in
thlB
country during the last twenty
months.
Although Counsellor Polk of the
state department, upon receiving the
request of the German embassy, ad
vised the department of Justice to re
turn the papers and to free Von Igel
unless his alleged offense was com
mitted before he became a member
of the embassy staff, federal agents
here said they had as yet received no
such instructions.
The case seems to hinge upon the
question whether the offense charged
against Von Igel was committed be
fore he was employed by the German
embassy. It is charged that the Wel
land canal plot was organized in Sep
tember, 1914, within two months of
the Beginning of the war. Records of
the state department show that it re
celved notice of the appointment of
Von Igel as a member of the embassy
staff in September, 1915, one year
after the aleged crime.
Von Igel Is at liberty under $20,000
bail. A hearing in his case is set for
next Tuesday. Federal prosecutors
asserted that he would be released
only upon Instructions from the at
torney general in Washington.
Counsel has been engaged for the
accused man and a diplomatic and
legal battle to obtain his release is
expected.
BERNSTORFF TAKES HAND.
Washington, D. C., April 19.—Secre
tary Lansing said today the Von Igel
case is now entirely in the hands of I
the department of justice. Under cer
tain circumstances it was said Von
Igel might not be entitled, as a diplo
matic agent, to have all his seized
documents returned and they will be
examined by the department of justice
to decide if any were immune.
Count von Bernstorff discussed the
matter with Secretary Lansing this
morning but neither would say any
thing about their conference.
.OP.
Omaha, Neb., April 19.—Henry
Ford has received the preferential
vote of Nebraska republicans, accord
ing to the returns received up to noon
today, with Cummins and Hughes fol
lowing and nearly tied. All of the
men elected as delegates at large to
the republican national convention
personally favor Hughes.
William J. Bryan, candidate for dele
gate at large to the democratic na
tional convention, polled the lowest
vote of the seven men running in this
(Douglas) county and is apparently
fourth in the race in Lancaster (Lin
coln), his home county.

"PIRATE" OFF TO
Young German Who Captured British

Wilmington, Del., April 19.—Ernest
Schiller, alias Clarence H. Hudson,
who recently held up the captain and
crow of fifty-six men of the British
freighter Matoppo on the high sea
was on his way to the federal prison
at Atlanta in custody of U. S. mar
shals. Schiller-yesterday pleaded guil

a life sentence.
Before leaving here last night Schil
ler in a statement declared that his
desire for revenge against England
had prompted his act. At the same
time, he said, he hoped to do some
thing "for the cause of Germany." He
denied that robbery had been his mo
tive and said that the chief reason
his plan to sink the Matoppo had fail
ed was because he did not want to
kill anybody.
LIQUOR QUESTION
ISSUE AT POLLS
Chicago, April 19.—Local option
elections coincident with the annual
city and village elections in a number
of Illinois cities and towns yesterday
failed to make any material change
in the liquor situation in the state, it
was learned today with the receipt of
practically complete returns.
Among places that were dry and re
mained so are Momence, Atkinson,
Ashkum, Chebanse and Deerfield.
Huey and Percy moved into the dry
column, while Arenzville went to the
liquor side. Steelville, Witt and
Worden were among the towns that re
tained their saloons.
By the annexation of 300 acres,
Evanston, a suburb, put four "blind
pigs" out of business. The places
had hitherto been outside the jurisdic

TREBIZOND FALLS
BEFORE RUSSIANS
IN SHARP ATTACK
FORTIFIED TURKI8H CITY, ON THE
BLACK 8EA NOW IN HANDS
OP THE ALLIE8.
London, April 19.—In the house
of commons today Premier As
quit stated that there were still
some material points of disagree
ment In the cabinet and if they
were not settled the result must
be the breakup of the govern
ment
London, April 19. —The Russians
have captured Trebizond, Turkey's
most important port on the Black sea.
The attack, which was made both by
land and sea, was sharp, quick and de
cisive. The Turkish garrison was esti
mated at more than 50,000 men.
The Russians also are pushing the
Turks hard in the region of Baiburt, to
the southeast, the capture of which
town would result in the joining of the
forces which recently captured EJrze
rum and those now at Trebizond and
give the Russians a line for a sllod ad
vance westward. This is part of the
plan for the isolation of the Turkish
forces in Mesopotamia.
The artillery duel around Ikskull
bridgehead Is still in progress but no
decided advantage is claimed either
by the Russians or Germans. Petrograd
reports the repulse of a German at
tack in Galicla at Popovamoghila and
the capture of large quantities of war
materials.
The Italians In mining operations on
top of the Col di Lana destroyed an
Austrian position and occupied the
mine crater, over which fighting now
is In progress. In the Sugana valley
the Austrians have driven the Italians
from advanced positions.
The situation In the British cabinet
over the question of conscription Is al
most at the breaking point, with the
conscrlptionlsts attacking the ministry
and strong parliamentary forces en
deavoring to sustain It.
BLOW TO TEUTONS.
Paris, April 19.—Paris received with
great enthusiasm the news of the fall
of Trebizond. The event waB looked
for but It was not thought the Rus
sians would be able to capture the city
so quickly. The political as well as
the military consequences are expect
ed to be most important, particularly
in view of the fact that Turkey has
lost one of the most valuable parts of
Asia Minor at a time when, according
to reports reaching Paris, Germany
is weakening her forces in the Balkans
to carry on attacks on the western
front.
French military writers state that
the plan of campaign of Grand Duke
Nicholas, the Russian commander, was
a daring one, which at first was looked
upon as foolhardy but now Is fully
justified. The grand duke decided to
advance bodly to the attack on this
front, where maneuvers of warfare
were possible, while the other fronts
were still held in deadlock.
Excluding the operations on the
Persian front, Grand Duke Nicholas,
In this campaign against an experienc
ed and stubborn foe, has to his credit
the storming of ten cities in less than
two months.
