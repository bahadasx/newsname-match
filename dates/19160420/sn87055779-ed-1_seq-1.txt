WASHINGTON, April 20. With
her wealth the greatest of any na

ilebt less than that of any belligerent
power, the United States today
stands in a state of adequate' finan

In this connection financiers who
have studied the European struggle
predict that the nation which can
throw the last hundred million dol
lars Into the halnrice will win the
war.
At the outbreak of the Furopean
war the United States occupied an
enviable position so far a.s national:

of increasing debt.
The Furopean war has caused the
belligerents to add about $ns.000,-OOO.Ort-O

"If the kaiser decides that a con
