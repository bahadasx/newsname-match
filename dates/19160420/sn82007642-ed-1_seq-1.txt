Germany has entered emphatic
denial that the Sussex was tor
pedoed by one of her command
ers and, as in the case of the Per
sia, whose destruction was dis
claimed by everybody, we may
assume that the Sussex torpe
doed herself. But even should
subsequent negotiations fail to
prove Germany guilty of the des
truction of the Sussex, the long
line of unarmed passenger liners
and vessels that have been tor
pedoed by the kaiser's submar
ines without warning gives this
government 'enough basis to
make good its threat to hoM
Germany to strict accountabil
ity. But why should we grow exci
ted about the Sussex, the En
glishman, the Manchester and
other late victims when we have
done nothing about the Lusita
nia, which went down almost a
year ago? Likewise the Falaba,
the Persia and the Arabic? What
does it avail us to weep at every
new wound when our grief is so
short-lived and our wrongs are
so qnickly forgotten? But, after
all, Americans, regardless of po
litical affiliations, are only hu
man and being human, they
must wonder at the frail quality
of an indignation which achieves
nothing. Need we ruffle our
feathers at every unarmed boat
that goes down to the bottom
of the sea, while the murdered
murdered women and children of
the Lusitania are unavenged,
and while the memory of Consul
McNeill fails to move us to com
passion? Such things will be and must
be as long as we maintain diplo
matic relations with a govern
ment which places no value upon
its pledged word. The average
American fails to see how such
relations can be maintained and
the national self-respect be pre
served. The position of the Uui
ted States today is anything but
an enviable one in the eyes of, the
world; we stand in the question
able position-of. having made a
threat which wedarenotexecute.
Recent press dispatches have it
that during the last two weeks
more than twenty neutral ships
. have been sunk, and most of them
without warning of any kind
These things happened ere the
the ink of Getmany's pledges to
refrain from such methods of war
fare had dried on the paper. Are
we justified in remaining on good
terms with a government which
virtually admits that its word is
worthless, and that its promises
are tendered in jest?

Growing Dahlias.
Mrs. J. B. Mklnion in Lenoir Topic
Choose a piece of ground tbat
is rich and loose. The dahlia
needs a soil rich, but not too rich,
if soil is poor the flowers will be
poor; if too rich, the plant will
make foliage at the expense of
the flowers. Plow or spade the
soil very, very deep. If fertilizer
of any kind is needed it must be
spread over the ground before
plowing or spading is done, and
thoroughly incorporated with
the soil. The best fertilizer is well
rotted stable manure. Never put
fertilizer in the hole where the
dahlia root is placed.
The planting may be done any
time in this country from April
15 to June 15 and late planting
is thought to be best by some
growers. Surely nothing is gain-
ed by early planting. Theclumps
of roots need to be divided leav
ing but one eye or sprout to a
piece, and if more than one comes
up after planting only the stron
gest should be left. Lay the tu
ber flat in planting and let it be
fully 6 inches below the surface
of the soil. Do not water when
planting, and unless the plants
are likely to die out right do not
water till in the fall when bloom
ing. It will do no harm to water
any time during summer if suffl
cient water is applied to soak to
the bottom of the roots, which
will require gallons of water for
each plant. Putting on a little
water induces the roots to form
near the surface and counteracts
all the benefit derived from deep
planting. Keep roots deep in
the ground. Plant in rows 4 ft.
by 3 ft. and keep tied to strong
stakes as the plant grows to pre
vent the plant being broken by
wind. Some growers advise
breaking the top out of the tall
varieties when eight inches high.
This makes them break down so
badly. Unless seeds are wanted
it is bet to keep all faded flowers
cut off.
The dahlia, like most other
flowers, makes seeds at the ex
pense of vitality. Growing dahl
ias from seeds is very interesting,
seeds may be sown in April in a
box or hot bed and transplanted
to the garden when large enough
giving tue space as the roots 2
by 3 feet It will be necessary to
water the seedlings during dry
weather or they will die as they
have no tuber to support them
while small. These plants will
bloom in September or October,
and no one will ever guess what
the flowers will be. They may be
shades of red, pink, yellow, and
white combinations of any or all
of the colors, double or single,
arge or small, but nearly all of
them will be handsome enough
to repay the grounds and work.
The single dahlias are becoming
very fashionable and are listed
by all leading florists and some
of them are very handsome and
are fine for cutting.
All dahlias require frequent cul
tivating, never allow a crust to
form on the surface of the soil
At blooming time a top dressing
of fertilizer or manure may be
beneficial but if soil is rich en
ough is not really necessary. Af.
ter the plant is entirely killed by
frost dig the clumps of roots and
store in a dry place where they
will not freeze. Dig the roots ear
ly in the day when the sun is shi
ning and let them lay m full sun
till late in the day to dry, then
store. Do not gather the roots
after the first light freezes. Leave
them until the tops are entirely
dead. -
It is one thing to put a man in
his place, but quite another mat
ter to make him fit"

"Read and band to your neigh
bo," is the rubber-stamped ad
vice on the pamphlets now being
sent over the State by Secretary
Grimes informing the voters as
to details of the tour amend
ments proposed to the Constitu
tion of the State to be voted on
in November. The advice isgood.
These amendments need careful
study on part of the voters as
they relate solely to the invest
ment of the legislature with new
powers, which would operate
largely in the direction of taking
from towns and municipalities
the right of self-government. Un
der the first amendment the Leg
islature would become the regu
lating power of the State in ma
ny local affairs. The General As
sembly would be prohibited from
passing any special or private
act or resolution that might be
applied for by any community
relative to the appointment of
justices of the peace, or relating
to health, sanitation or the a
batement of nuisances. The chan
ging of the names of cities, towns
and townships, the laying out of
streets, highways and alleys, ex
tending the time for assessment
and collection of taxes or other
wise relieving a tax-collector, and
many oter matters of local con
cern come under the prohibition.
The Legislature would be given
power to appoint special or emer
gency judges, and no corpora
tion except those of charitable,
educational, penal or reformato
ry nature, could be created, nor
charter extended by special act.
The entire matter of corporation
or charter would be in the hand?
of the legislature. So, also, would
the Legislature take full control
over the organization of cities.
towns and incorporated villages,
restricting their powers of taxa
tion, assessment, borrowing mon
ey, contracting debts and loan
ing their credit. This would w
done in order "to prevent abuse
in assessment and in contracting
debts by such municipal corpora
tions. Unlike the case of the late
amented effort in adoption of
constitutional amendments, the
'our proposed for the November
elections will not stand or fall to
gether. One can be carried and
another rejected at the pleasure
of the voter. The State is cover
ed by 500,000 copies of the a-
mendments and this number
should be sufficient for the pur
pose, which is the enlightenment
of the voters on the matter. .The
Observer would recommend a
close study of the four items and
their purport.M?harlotte Obser

The Observer is entirely in ac-
cord with the estimation placed
on the character and equipment
of Mr. Frank A. Linne.y, whom
the Republicans have decided on
as their candidate for Governor
of the State. M r Linney inherits
his politics and his sterling traits
of character from his father, one
of the sturdiest citizens of the
Western part of the state. He
is a strong man and in every
way qualified for the position for
which the Republicans have nam
ed him and he will come about
as near Dollintr the full strength
of that party in North CarolinaT1'8
as any man that could have been
picked from its list of strongest
men. Mr Linney will have the
capacity to interest the Demo
cratic nominee in the campaign
and his candidacy will insure a-
gainst that too-frequent occur
rence in North Carolina of a one
sided political contest. Char

Hot Air.
How much of it there is in the
world to be sure! Hearst is the
master Jhot air artist on earh,
but millions of readers eagerly
follow his shrieking headlines o
ver his impossible stories. Yellow
journalism, intead of losing out,
seems to be growing more and
more popular. It is a pity that
our news service is so unreliable.
We have been fooled as to the
situation in Mexico and are like
ly to be fooled again. Villa is hale
and hearty. His hip has not been
shatted: his leg is unbroke. The
victory of Generall Dodd was not
so overwhelming as we first be
lieved. The stories of the war in
Europe grew stale long ago. Brill
iant correspondents who thrilled
us with their daring exploits as
they dodged the bullets of the
Germans and endured all the pri
vations of th battlefield, wrole
from their rooms in luxurious
hotels with the ocean between
them and the field of carnage
they so grapicahy described. But
we swallowed their bait and
thought we were getting the un
diluted truth. What is truth? was
the question Pilate asked the
Master in the long ago. It is a
pertinent question now. There is
this about it: it is the only thing
that endures. Hot airevaporates
and vanishes. It is a pity the ar
tists who manufacture it do not
evaporate aso. But they stay
with us and we read their fiction
the-sameasif it were the solid
truth. Correspondents are n o t
always to blame, however. Some-
times honest men are deceived by
promoters who announce gigan
tic schemes that that need ad
vertising. We have been hearing
a lot about a quarter million dol
lar auditorium to be built at
Black Mountain with a $75,000
organ, for the use of a great mu
sical organization under the di
rection of Walter Damroch. A
gentleman from that section told
us the other, day, that not a dol
lar from this vast enterprise is in
sight, and that Walter Dam
roscli has never been to Black
Mountain in his life! We do not
know whether this gentleman
knew what he is talking aboutor
not, but that is what he told us,
and we give it to you as it came
to us. If this enterprise should
prove to be a fiasco it is the fin
est illustration of hot air, pure
and tsimple, that we have yet
had in North Carolina. Charity

The Great Boon.
The boon of pence is suck as
grease, and we should guard and
prize it, and love it well, for war
is bell no delegate denies it. On
Europe's strand, where peace is
canned, and all the kings are
scrappy, the people know the
depths of woe, and not a soul is
happy. But here, where peace
fulfills its lease, with industry, its
neighbor, remote from fear we
walk and hear the sounds of lion
est labor. The mill wheels hum,
the plumbers plumb, the farmers
go a-seeding, and you can walk
a city block 'and see no fellow
bleeding. The spinner spins, the
tinner tins, the banker banks the
boodle oh. happy land, wherein
the band is playing Yankee Doo
diet Such peace as this is surely
the timbrel Bounds our
...
gladness, the psalter psalts, the
waiter waits to whoop for war
is madness! By Europe's streams
the moonlight gleams on pale
and ghastly corpses', and heaven
frowns on blackened towns and
shattered guns and horses. But
on this shore no wave of .gore
against the homesteads washes;
the sunlight shines on pumpkin
vines, and large and luscious
squashes.-Walt Mason in News
and Observer. '
Obituary.
The subject of this sketch was
our beloved sister, Miss Marga
ret Dugger, who departed this
life Sept. 14, 1915. She was a
?reat sufferer for many years but
bore it with great christian pa
tience and fortitude. She was 65
years and 1 day old. She joined
the Brushy Fork Baptist church
in Nov. 1877. In later years she
Moyed her membership to Cove
Creek Baptist church, where she
remained a member until b h e
moved her letter, going into the
constitution of the Willow Dale
church, where she remained a
faithful member until her death.
Sister Margaret was ever ready
to extend a helping hand to those
in distress; was ready to speak a
kind word to all and to cheer the
unfortuate. She often expressed
her willingness to go. her only re
gret being to leave her lonely sis
ter who had been so faithful to
ber during her sickness.
She left three brothers and one
sister, together with many rela
tives and friends to mourn her
keparture. She is a great loss to
the church and Sunday school,
yet we realize that it is her eter
nal gain. Let us take knowledge
of her noble, christian life. May
we all live up to her example.
Hut her sorrows quiokly fled,
When she heard His gentle voice,
Christ had risen from the dead,
Now he bids her heart rejoice.
What a change His work can
make,
Turning darkness into day.

lie will wipe your tears away.
