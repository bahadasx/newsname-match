WASHINGTON, April 1!). The full
text of the note to Germany follows:
You are Instructed to deliver to the
secretary of foreign affairs a com
munication reading as follows:
1 did not fail to transmit immediate
ly, by telegraph, to my government,
your excellency's note of the tenth in
stant in regard to the disastrous ex
plosion of March 24, last, which
wrecked the French steamship Sussex
in the English channel. I have now
the honor to deliver, under instruc
tions from my government, the follow
ing reply to your excellency:
Information now in the possession of
the government of the United States
fully establishes the facts in the case
of the Sussex and the inferences
which my government has drawn from
that information it -regards as con
firmed by the circumstances set forth
in your excellency's note of the tenth
instant. On the tweny-fourth of March.
1916, at about 2:50 o'clock in the after
noon, the unarmed steamer Sussex,
with 325 or more passengers on board,
among whom were a number of Amer
ican citizens, was torpedoed while
while crossing from Folkestone to
Dieppe. The Sussex had never been
armed: was a vessel known to be hab
itually used only for the conveyance
of passengers across the English chan
nel and was not following the route
taken by troop ships or supply ships.
About 80 of her passengers, non-com
batants. of all ages and sexes, includ
ing citizens of the United States, were
killed or injured.
A careful, detailed and scrupulously
impartial investigation by naval and
military officers of the United States
has conclusively established the fact
that the Sussex was torpedoed with
out warning or summons to surrender,
and that the torpedo by wnich she was
struck was of German manufacture. Jn
tlie view of the government ->f the
United States these facts from the
first made the conclusion that the lor
pedo was fired by a German .-.utnua
rine unavoidable. It now considers
that conclusion substantiated uy the
statements of vour excellency's note
A full statement of the facts upon
which the government of the United
States has based its conclusion is in
closed.
The government of the United
States, after having given careful con
..... . ...... „ .
sideration to the note of the imperia' i
government of the tenth cf April, , c -,
grets to state that the impression made [
upon it by the statements contained 1
in that note is that he imperial gov
ernment has failed to appreciate the
gravity of the situation which has re
suited, not alone from the attack on
fhe Sussex, but from tlie whole method
and character of submarine warfare
as disclosed by the unrestrained prac
tice of the commanders of Germa:
undersea oraft during the past 12
months and more in the Indiscriminate
destruction of merchant vessels of all
sorts, nationalities and destinations.
If the sinking of the Sussex had been
art isolated case the government of
the Unjted States might find it possi
ble to hone that the officer who was
responsible for that act had wilfully
violated liis orders or had been crini
inally negligent in takiug none of the
precautions they prescribed, and that
tlie ends of justice might be satisfied)
by imposing upon him an adequate!
punishment, coupled with a formal dis
avowal of the net and payment of suit-!
able indemnity by the imperial gov-'
ernment. But, though the attack upon !
the Susse* was manifestly indefensi
hie and caused a loss of life so tragical
as to make it stand forth as one of tlie
most terrible examples of tlie inliu- ;
inanity of submarine wai-fam as the'
manity of submarine warfare as the
commanders of German vessels are
conducting it, it unliappih docs not
stand alone.
On the contrary, the government of
the United States is forced by recent
events to conclude that it is only one
instance, even though one of the most
extreme and most distressing in
stances, of the deliberate method and
spirit, of indiscriminate destruction of
merchant vessels of all sorts, nation
alities and destinations which have
become more and more uninistakeabte
as the activity of German undersea
vessels of war has in recent months
been quickened and extended.
The imperial German government!
will recall that when, in February, 1
1915. it announced its intention of,
ti eating the waters surrounding Great i
Britain and Ireland as embraced with
in tlie seat of war and of destroying j
all merchant ships owned by its ene-j
mies that might be found within that ,
zone of danger, and warned all vessels, j
neutral as well as belligerent, to keep"'
out of waters thus proscribed, or to! !
enter them at their peril, the govern

Huch vessels. It based its protest on
the ground that persons of neutral na
tionality and vessels of neutral owner

intolerable risks; and that no right to

I PRESIDENT BEFORE CON GRESS
lJnifd S S^ GT0 1l' , Apri ! ' ?; _ T P f esident Ison's lo * 1 8" ex Pected final warning to Germany that thT
United States will break off diplomatic relations unless she abandons her present method of submarine
warfare and immediately declares her intention to do so, was delivered today in a note to Berlm and
also was announced by the president in an address to a joint session of congress. The president con
siders that the next step depends solely upon Germany and that three or four days constitute a rea
sonable time for a reply. Diplomatic history records but one instance where a breaking of relations
between two first-class powers has not eventually brought war—that which now exists between Ger
many and Italy. Congress received the president's declaration of his course with mixed evidence of
concern and approbation. Most of the leaders, democrats and republican, thought the president hardly
US a political play. President Wilson's words leave no opportunity for double
yngress, he said:
meaning In
'1 have
it my duty to say
to tlie imperial German government
that it it is still its purpose to prose
cute relentless and indiscriminate war
fare * * * the government of the
United States is at last forced to a
conclusion that there is but one course
it can pursue, and that unless the
imperial German government should
now, immediately, declare and effect
an abandonment of its present moth
ods of warfare against passenger and
freight-carrying vessels, this govern
ment can have no choice but to sever
diplomatic relations altogether."
The president asked nothing of con
gress; he came to inform it of his ac
tion. He did it in fifteen minutes and
congress went back to work, solemnly
impressed with tlie situation which
confronts the country. The scene had
been dramatically human. The presi
dent's demeanor reflected liis state of
mind and an impartial observer read
ily would say the demeanor of con
gress as a whole reflected its sym
pathy.
Tlie first actually crucial moment
toward which tlie relations of the
United States and Germany have been
steadily drifting for nearly a year had
come and passed and the president
returned to the White House to await
the next one. America awaits tile
answer of Berlin.

.out to representatives here of neutral
nations on the assumption that they
are as much interested as the United
States in the protection of neutral
rights. The document was not given
to any of the belligerent diplomats, as
the controversy is regarded as being
solely between the United States and
Germany.
Count von Bernsdorff lias reiterat
ed to Secretary Lansing under no eir
cunistances will Germany give up the
submarine as a weapon of warfare, be
cause she contends it is retaliation
for Great Britain's food blockade. The
ambassador lias declared, however,
"'at llis government will attempt to
conduct submarine operations within
the law ° r nations. This the United
S,ates is "Ming to discuss after Ger
lino
many lias abandoned her present
methods not before.
Against that possibility stands the
declaration in the American note that
tlie United States has considered from
the first that (lie employment of sub
marines for destruction or commerce
is by its very nature "utterly incom
patible with tlie principles of hu
manity, the long established and in
controvertible rights of neutrals and
tlie sacred immunities of non com

many will have opportunity to accede

No reasonable explanation can lie giv

tlie captain suw something which al
so caused him to change liis course
sharply to starboard.
In addition to tliis evidence which
would in itself appear to he ronclii
sive that tlie agent of destruction was
torpedo, is that of Lieutenant Hmith,
attached to the American embassy at
Paris, who, accompanied by Mujor
I.Olgan, IT. S. A., of the embassy,
went to Bologne, Inspected the hull
of the Sussex and personally touiid
beneath tlie mass of water-soaked
debris of tin- wreck 15 pieces of motal
which they retained in their posses

formed part of the vessel. The inspec
tion of the hull disclosed that the
vessel was wrecked by an external ex
plosion. tlie boilers being intart, and
that a short distance forward of tlie
bridge was a large dent showing that
tlie vessel had received a heavy blow,
tlie direction of tlie impact being
from abaft tlie beam along a line
an acute angle with tlie keel of tlie
vessel. I Report of Lieutenant Smith
cabled April 1.) This evidence co
incides with and coroborates tha
