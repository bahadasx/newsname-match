AN APPRECIATION
' "The friends thou hast and heir
adoption tried, grapple to thy soul
with hooks of steel," said Shakes
pere, and the friends we have in Al
good have been tried in the balance
and never found wanting, through
illnesses, sorrows and death, and
their adoption was truly tried when
our home was burned . to the ground
within an hour. How they rallied
around us! How they worked!
And how many things they saved.
It was marvelous and the scene an j
Impressive one. Brothers and sis
ters could not have gathered up our
treasures and carried them to places
of safety more tenderly and loving
ly, than did these dear friends.
""hov seemed to try to save all they
thought we valued most and the lit-
tlo'Jthlngs w loved, even to our Da-
bys little red wagon. Some dear
mother must have thought of that.
, For such loving kindness and great
help. , words are inadequate to offer
in thanks,, but our hearts are offer-
lng thanksgivings for such Trlends,
.1
est . blessings may rest upon them
these dear good people of Algood,
who have been . indeed proven all
good and faithful in times of need.

in Cookeville. The people generally

Among the many goed stories told

grades, telling three bright stories,
first "The Little Green Kitty", sec
ond, "How Bunny Became King of
Babyland", an easter story, third
"Dwarf Laughter", this last story
ending with the children memoriz
ing the following lines, which they
did quickly. '
'Smile a smile;
When you smile, another smiles
And soon.
There's miles and miles of smiles,
e'n worth while.
If you will smile." ,

Eaatar Influence In Gr.ec.
The Influence of the church is strong
ly felt by the common people of Greece.
They keep Its long fasts religiously
and for fifty days before Easter eat
neither meat, fish, butter nor eggs, but
live on figs, olives, bread and wine.
On the Friday before Easter funeral
services are held for Christ in all the
churches, and at the close of the serv
ices the congregations go out to bury
him. Brass bands play slow music as
at military funerals, and the proces
sion carries black banners, crosses and
other emblems of mourning, while
great multitudes follow bearing can
dles. Why th Lily Means Easter.
The lily is typical of Easter because
of its whiteness and personification of
purity. In its natural state It blooms
about Easter time In France, its native
home.
Easter Day In
Easter day is pre-eminently a day for church-
tfoing. Three hundred
mated, throng the churches throughout the
world on Easter, bending the knee in homage
before the King of kings.
The Easter festival is one of the
endar, a festival in which flowers
parts.
Easter is the harbinger
season of hope, of revivified life, presaging the
immortality of which man in his philosophic
moments has a vague perception. ,
Let this Easter day bring you
church which God established for
Go to church on Easter and hear, in anthem
and sermon that marvelous story of the resur
rection. Who knows? By that very, act of at
tending the house of worship you may resurrect
in your own soul the latent God hunger which,
when it fills one's life, transforms him into a man
of wondrous power.

COOKEVILLE THE CLEAN
The progressive Mayor of Cooke
ville having proclaimed Saturday
April 15th as Clean-Up Day, every
property owner in the town has cer
tainly 'been busy' as one can plainly
and happily see, from all sides and
angles.
The civic department of the Parent
Teachers Association, of which Mrs.
Clarence Wilson is chairman. Is de
lighted with the results.
Mayor Holladay expresses himself
as being highly gratified at the hear
ty co-operative spirit manifested Dy
all the people, and as being proud to
see the town in general, in so clean
ly and sightly a condition. Mayor
Holladay also compliments Mrs. Cla
rence Wilson of the civic depart
ment for the able manner in which
the clean-up campaign was handled.
The judges appointed by Mayor
Holladay to award the $5. cash prize
offered by the civic department to
the person having cleanest premises
had a most difficult task and their
earnest endeavor to be just is great
ly appreciated by all. Their decis
ion is entirely satisfactory.
Mr. Parker's letter to the Mayor,
also the Mayor's reply are given be
low: Cookeville, Tenn.,
April 19th, 1916.
Mayor Holladay,
City.
Sir: The committee selected by the
City Board, to act as judges in the
'lean-Up Campaign", beg to sud
m't the following as' a result of its
investigation of the properties of
Cookeville, which have recently been
improved by cleaning, . etc. After
mature consideration, the winner of
the prize was decided to be Mr. Hugh
Hargis. Owing, however, to the
many place ; which clearly evidenced
the fact that earnest and honest ef
forts had been made to put them in
first class shape, It was thought wise
by the committee to name a second
and third property, in the nature of
an honorable mention, as credit is
due certain of the property owners
who have worked real hard in this
campaign. Therefore, second place
was given to Dr. Henry Martin, and
third place to Mr." McDearman. Oth
er than these two properties, the
committee has a list of nine owners,
the result of whose work is deserv
ing of especial mention. This- list
will be furnished the Board if so de
sired. The committee begs to state
that it wag very gratifying to find
the many places in such excellent
condition as to neatness and cleanli
ness, and the town should feel proud
over the results attained.
Respectfully,
C. E. Parker,
Prof. Carlisle,
Prof. Harrison,
Committee.

ANOTHtR FREAK EGG
Dear Editor : I see an account of . ,
a great stunt a Cookeville hen has
got off, but will you listen to this. I
found an egg three weeks ago as large
as a goose egg with the white and
yolk, and also contained an ordinary
sized egg in a hard snell. Then in
the same place in a few days I found
an ordinary sized egg with a long 1
slim egg lapped about an inch on that
one, the latter only having the white.
So the Cookeville hen hasn't pulled
off the only stunt yet. Mrs. T. C.
Holladay, Lebanon Route 5.
