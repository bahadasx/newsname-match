BELTRAMI LAND SURVEY
St. Paul, April 20.Governor J.
A A. Burnquist today approved the
tentative plan for the government to
survey Northern Minnesota lands,
providing for drainage and overflow

an appropriation from the federal
government and also to secure an ap
propriation from the Minnesota legis

The benefit from this plan, accord
ing to the governor, is to prevent ov

The San Diego, Cal., "white way"
system is the finest ever seen, ac

turned last week with his wife from
a visit in California.
The arch system is used in San

less expensive and considered more
beautiful than the post or cluster
systems.

CHARTERCOMMISSION
TO HOLD MEETING TO
CONSIDEBAMENDMENT
'White Way" Project May Be Taken
Up by Freeholders Next
Week.
ASSESSMENT FOR NEW
PROJECT TO BE CHANGED
Fifteen Men Appointed to Commission
in 1913 by District
Court.
The Charter Commission of Bemidji
will probably hold a meeting next
week to discuss a proposed amendment
to the charter for the installation of
a "white way."
A joint committee of the Commer
cial club and the city council has re
quested the commission to provide an
amendment for the charter so that
the installation of a "white way" can
be assessed two-thirds against the
adjoining property owners and one
third against the entire city.
Now Against City.
Under the present charter the in
stallation of a "white way" must be
assessed against the entire city. The
committees were of the opinion that
it would not be fair to residents in
other parts of the city to pay the en
teir cost of the installation of a down
town improvement. They believed
that the adjoining property owner
should pay more for the improvement
than the city as a whole.
A. P. White Chairman.
A. P. White, chairman of the com
mission, is at present out of the city.
He is expected to return Saturday
and it is believed that he will call
a meeting of the commission next
week.
Several members of the commission
this morning expressed themselves
against the amending of the charter
on account of the expense of holding
an election. It is believed, however,
that an amendment will be submitted
at the primary election in June.
Plans for the "white way" will be
completed as soon as the question
of assessments for the improvement
is settled.
Fifteen Members.
Members of the charter commission
are F. S. Arnold, W. N. Bowser, K.
K. Roe, G. E. Carson, A. P. White,
J. J. Opsahl, F. S. Lycan, J. M. Rich
ards, F. W. Rhoda, Dr. B. A. Shan
non, R. H. Schumaker, Attorney ES.
E. McDonald, F. M. Malzahn, M. E.
Ibertson and E. R. Getchell. This
commission was appointed March 21,
1913, by Judge W. S. McClenahan,
Judge B. F. Wright and Judge C. W.
Stanton of the district court.
J. M. Richards is the only member
of the commission who is not in the
city. It is believed that the vacancy
caused by his absence will be filled.

er of the boat, the "City of Bemidii,"

ceedings against the Star theater
building, which the state fire marshal

EASTER EGGS AND
CHICKS ARE SCARCE
Easter eggs and Easter chicks are
to be scarce in Bemidji.
Local grocers and supply houses
have been unable to secure enough
eggs or enough chickens to supply the
demand. Eggs are selling for 22
cents a dozen while chickens are sell
ing at 25 cents a pound and cannot be
obtained at all times at that price.
Candy stores are displaying Easter
confections in various forms.

SUMMER CHAUTAUQUA
TO BE IN AU6UST
Word was received in Bemidji to
day that the summer Chautauqua of
the Vawter Chautauqua system would
be held in Bemidji beginning about
August 7.
Efforts had been made to secure
the Chautauqua here on an earlier
date, during the sessions of the teach
ers' training school here.
A conflict of dates makes it impos
sible for the Chautauqua to appear
here earlier than August.
COMMERCIAL CLUB RENEWS
APPLICATION FOR RAILWAY
J. J. Opsahl today wired Congress
man C. A. Lindbergh in Washington
to renew the application made in
1913 for the right to build a rail
road across the Red Lake Indian res
ervation.
The Federal government will only
permit one railroad to be constructed
across the resercation. Application
was made in 1913 but no action was
taken.
Congressman Lindbergh wired Mr.
Opsahl late this afternoon that he had
referred the matter to the Depart
ment of Interior.
The Commercial club is consider
ing plans for enducing a railroad to
construct a line from Red Lake to
Warroad or to Baudette. The line
would tap a rich agricultural sec
tion.

NOTE ARRIVES IN BERLIN
GERARD GETS MESSAGE
Bernstorff Seeks Interview With Lan
sing: Note is Last Word of
United States.
BULLETIN
Washington, April 20.It is
officially admitted that marines
have been rushed to the big Ger
man owned wireless at Tucker
ton and Sayville. The reason is
not announced. It is presumed
to protect the station from anti
German demonstrations and to
permit the seizure in case of a
break with Germany.
London, April 20.President Wil
son's note reached the embassy at
Berlin at eleven o'clock this morning.
It is the last word on the submarine
crisis and is an ultimatum to Ger
many. Ambassador Gerard at Berlin
received a confidential message from
Washington this morning.
Will Not Yield.
Well informed officials here do not
believe that Germany will yield.
They are of the opinion that a diplo
matic break is possible. They base
their views that the German govern
ment in a statement said that the
submarines were the most effective
weapon they had in fighting England.
They believe that a concession on the
part of Germany at this time is im
possible.
Seeks Interview.
Washington, April 20.With a
choice of a break with the United
States or changing the method of
submarine warfare, resting squarely
with Germany, Ambassador Bernstorff
today is seeking an interview with
Secretary Lansing. Secretary, Lan
sing refused an interview yesterday.
President Wilson made public Ms
last word yesterday afternoon in a
note to Germany.
The Etete^ayB-:
"Unless the imperial government
should now immediately declare and
effect an abandonment of its present
methods of submarine warfare
against passenger and freight carry
ing vessels, the government of the
United States can have no choice but
to sever diplomatic relations with the
German empire altogether."
"If," says the note, "it is still the
purpose of the imperial government
to prosecute relentless and indiscrimi
nate warfare against vessels of com
merce by the use of submarines with
out regard to what the government
of the United States must consider
the sacred and indisputable rules of
international law and the universally
recognized dictates of humanity, the
government of the United States is
at last forced to the conclusion that
there is but one course to pursue."
Believe Sussex Torpedoed.
The note asserts that information
in the possession of the United States
establishes" conclusively that the
channel steamer Sussex was torpe
doed without warning and that the
torpedo was a German manufacture.
The conclusion that the torpedo was
fired by a German submarine, it adds,
is considered substantiated by Ger
many's disclaimer.
The note declares that if the Sus
sex had been an isolated case the
United States might regard it as pos
sible to hope that the officer respon
sible had been negligent or violated
his orders, but that unhappily this
terrible example of submarine war
fare does not stand alone.
Ikils to Appreciate Gravity.
Germany is informed that the
United States gained the impression
from her recent communication that
the imperial government failed to ap
preciate the gravity of the situation
which has resulted, not alone from
the attack on the Sussex, but from
the wholesale method and character
of submarine warfare as disclosed by
the unrestrained practice of the com
manders of German undersea craft
during the past twelve months and
more in the indiscriminate destruc
tion of merchant vessels of all sorts,
nationalities and destinations.
An appendix to the note which
deals entirely with an analysis of the
facts in the Sussex case discloses that
American army and navy officers
found in the Sussex screw bolts which
correspond with those found on Ger
man torpedoes in possession of the
French naval authorities at Toulon.
The screw bolts are used to fasten
the "war head" to the air chamber.
The Yeoman lodge will meet at the
home of Mrs. H. P. Schmidt, 306
Third street, tomorrow night at 8:30
o'clock. All members are requested
to be present.
