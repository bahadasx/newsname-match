SITUATION REMAINS
UNCHANGED ON BORDER
Reply to Carranza Note Is a Puz­
zle for State Depart­
ment.
Washington, April 19.—No decision
as to the withdrawal of the American
troops from Mexico is expected for a
week or ten days unless there are
new outbreaks against the forces iu
Mexico to compel immediate action.
This was made clear today when
Secretary Baker dispatched Major
General Scott, chief of staff, to the
border, as his personal representative
1o make complete report on the mil­
itary problem confronting Gen. Funs
ton.
Final Action Soon.
The final action of the administra­
tion on Gen. Carranzu's suggestion
that the expedition be recalled prob­
ably will be based on what is shown
in this report.
.Mr. BaKer laid stress in his an­
nouncement on the fact that Gen.
Funston is in supreme command of
the border situation.
Puzzled Over Reply.
In the meantime, state department
officials will take up the question of
what, reply they shall make to the
Carranza note urging withdrawal of
the American forces.
Gen. Scott's orders permit him to
go here he thinks best along the
border or into. M««ico to obtain \£los6
and accurate knowledge of the situa­
tion wanted by Secretary Baker.
Dispatches from the border of Mex­
ico today contained no word of devel­
opments changing the situation. The
expedition seeking Villa is at a stand­
still apparently, concentrated at a
point where Gen. Pershing and Funs
ton believe they are best protected
against what may come.
Believe Villa Dead.
According to messages received at
Mexico City, evidence confirmatory of
the death of Francisco Villa is being
slowly gathered. Officials are now
more disposed to give credit to the
first report of the finding of the grave
of the bandit. One report today said
that the Indian who cared for Villa
during his last illness had been lo­
cated and depositions taken. Accord­
ing to these affidavits, Villa died of
blood poisoning. At the foreign of­
fice full credit is bein gattached to
the statements of this Indian.

New York, April 19.—After being
chased half the length of the Mediter­
ranean by a submarine, the Italian
steamer, America, arrived here today
from Naples, with 1,255 passengers.
On April 6, while steaming through

QUARRELED OVER
PACK OF MARKED CARDS
Frank Allen, colored, and Frank
Allen, white, while engaged in a quar­
rel over an express package, becamc
so enraged that the former drew a
knife and stabbed the white man in
the abdomen and would, undoubtedly
•have killed him there, had not Mr.
xvirk of the Northern Express com­
pany drawh a revolver and separated
the tWQ. At' that .the ijegra j$n
and •immediately went'to Dr. Boden
stab's office to have a wound dressed
where the white man had struck him.
Marked Cards the Cause.
The row began when Mr. Allen, the
wounded man, appeared at the ex­
press office with a package of marked
cards which had been ordered by Al­
len, colored. The aggressor then ac­
cused the traveling man of having
opened mail belonging to him. The
lie was passed and in the melee the
white man is reported to have struck
the negro, who immediately drew a
large pocket knife and stabbed the
traveler.
Wound Very Dangerous.
The wound in the abdomen of Allen,
the white man, is so serious that it' is
feared that he will not recover. He
was taken to the Bisamekr hospita.1,
where the wound was dressed and
every aid given the injured man. In­
quiry at the residence on Mandan ave­
nue, where Allen, the traveling man.
boarded, indicated that he was con­
sidered a quiet, well ordered man and
attended strictly to his own affairs.
He is absent from Bismarck much of
the time placing the "dime punch
boards" in restaurants and other plac­
es where the form of semi-chance is
carried on.
Allen, the Negro.
Allen, colored, lives on the south
side and whose visible means of sup­
port are not known, has held forth on
South Eighth street, where he has
maintained a sort of home. Others of
his race in the city state they do not
know of his occupation unless it was
that of gambling, poker, craps and
others games of chance.
Left Scene of Fray.
Immediately the affair was over,
Negro Allen left and went to the doc­
tor's office to have his eye dressed.
Magistrate Dolan, who was one of the
first to arrive at the scene of the at­
tempted murder, traced him to the
physician's office and arrested him.
Allen made no resistance and accom­
panied the magistrate to the county
jail, where the man was given into
the sheriff's keeping. Orders were
given to keep a close watch upon the
negro and to use the utmost care to
see that he does not make away with
himself.
May Be Murder Charge.
The condition of the Injured man at
a late hour last night was said to be
extremely precarious. -Hopes were
still held for his recovery unless some
unforeseen complications should arise,
in the meantime the negro will be
held on a charge alleging assault with
a dangerous weapon and, in case the
man dies, this will be changed to mur­
der.

Used Pitchfork in Assaulting Her
After She Refused His
Attentions.
Minot, N. D., April 19.—Miss Alma
Kelson, a young woman living near
Urady, was badly beaten up by Geo.
Ilemingen, a young man employed on
the farm of Charles T. Nelson, the
father of the victim of the outrage.
Hemingen was arrested by the sher­
iff late yesterday and waived a pre­
liminary hearing before Justice Wil­
lis and was bound over to the district
court on a charge of assault with a
deadly weapon with intent to do great
bodily harm. The young brute used
a pitchfork in his assault on the
young woman.
The story is that the assailant had
become infatuated with Miss Nelson,
who refused to recognize him in any
manner, even as a friend. He is said
to have wanted her to marry him and
when she indignantly repulsed his ad­
vances in that direction he became
enraged and proceeded to beat her up
with the first weapon at hand, which
happened to be a pitchfork. She was
severely injured about the head and
body before help reached her and her
assailant was forced to desist, but.
is resting easier and it is expected
that she will suffer no permanent in­
juries from her terrible experience.
Considerable indignation was ex
presed throughout the community in
which Miss Nelson lives and in which
she is held in the highest esteem and
respect, at the outrage. She is con­
sidered the unfortunate victim of in­
sane jealousy of a man without man­
hood, and expressions of sympathy
have been lavished upon her by
friends and neighbors.

REPORT SENT TO
BERLIN ON AFFAIR
Diplomat Appeared More Per­
turbed Than at Any
Other Time.
Washington, April 19.—Count von
Hernstorff, the German ambassador,
sent to Berlin tonight a long dispatch
interpreting the situation in Washing­
ton and making certain recommenda­
tions. He is understood to have ad­
vised his government that the United
States meant just what it said in its
submarine note and that something
would have to be done quickly if
friendly relations were to continue.
Makes No Comment.
The ambassador himself, having
read the address of the president and
the note, said:
"I can make no comment, either
upon the address or upon the com­
munication which has been sent to
my government." However, he was
authoritatively described as having
advised the Berlin foreign office in
the message sent tonight that he be­
lieved, at least, some such declara­
tion as that made regarding the con­
duct of submarine warfare in the
Mediterranean Sea should be issued
immediately to cover all submarine
operations.
Is Perturbed.
AVhile the ambassador tonight ap­
peared to be more perturbed than at
any time since the beginning of the
submarine controversy, he was said
to feel that his government would
go every possible length to prevent
the severance of diplomatic relations.
Persons in close touch with the af­
fairs of the embassy quoted him as
saying:
"I believe some way will he found
satisfactorily to meet the position of
the United Sates."

Puarie of Slim Buttes, this county,

young homesteader for whom she had
been caring during an illness. The pa­
tient and another young man had
quarreled during the day, and in the
evening, when the homesteader was
aroused from sleep by a noise just
outside the door of his home, he de­
manded to know who was there. Re­
ceiving no answer, and thinking it
was the man with whom he had quar­
reled, he shot thorugh the door and
killed Mrs. Puarie. The coroner's
jury exonorated him.

TOO ANXIOUS
Berlin Correspondent Regrets
Impression of Sussex
Note.
Frankfurt, Germany, via London,
April 1!).—The Berlin correspondent
of the Farnkfurter Zeitung, comment­
ing on the recent declaration of the
British on the Sussex, says that Sir
Edward Grey was all too anxious to
rush to the assistance of President
Wilson and Secretary of State Lan­
sing in forming a judgment on the
Sussex case. He regrets that the Ger­
man note on the Sussex seems to
have had an unsatisfactory effect in
the United States. The correspond­
ent,
who
is in the closest touch with
oflicial quarters, closes with the fol­
lowing:
"It is plain for every German that
what the foreign office in Berlin stat­
ed in the note on the basis of a care­
ful investigating by the admiralty
staff regarding the sinking of the Sus­
sex and other ships was under all cir­
cumstances the truth, and those who
are responsible for Germany's foreign
policy await the next American note
with confidence and further develop­
ments with a clear conscience."
PIONEER DIES.

several months. The cause of death
was Bright's disease.
R. F. FLINT
Robert iF. Flint has announced that
he is a candidate to succeed himself
as commisioner of agriculture and
labor.
As dairy commissioner for several
years and, for the past year, as the

ture. Eob Flint has rendered faithful
and efficient service in the numerous
and varied duties of these positions.
He is a firm believer in the desira­
bility of placing North Dakota among
the states that are recognized as be­
ing large producers of livestock of
all kinds and of high quality, and
never misses an opportunity to ad­
vance our interests along those and
similar lines.
His work, which has taken him in­
to every portion of the state, has
given him knowledge and. therefore,
an appreciation of the resources of
the state and. when yoa couple these
with an energetic desire to render
good service, you have the right com­
bination for the office.

Your Excellency's note of the 10th
inst., in regard to certain attacks by
German submarines, and particularly
in regard to the disastrous explosion,
which on March 24 last, wrecked the
French steamship, Sussex, in the
English Channel. I have now the
honor to deliver under instructions
from my government the following
reply to Your Eexcellency:
Reviews Events.
Information now in the possession
of the government of the United
States fully establishes the facts in
the case of the Sussex, and the in­
ferences which my government has
drawn from that information, it re­
gards as confirmed by the circum­
stances set forth in Your Excellen­
cy's note of the ,10th. inst. On the
24th of March, 1916, at about 2:50
o'clock in the afternoon, the unarmed
steamer, Sussex, with 325, or more,
pasengers aboard, among whom were
a number of American citizens, was
torpedoed while crossing from Folke­
stone to Dieppe. The Sussex had
never been armed was a vessel
known to be habitually used only for
the conveyance of passengers across
the English Channel, and was not
following the route taken by troop
ships or supply ships. About eight
•of her pasengers, non-combatants of
all ages and sexes, including citizens
of the United States, were killed or
injured.
Impartial Investigation.
A careful and detailed unscrupu­
lously impartial investigation by nav­
al and military officers of the United
States has conclusively established
the fact that the Sussex was torpe­
doed without warning or summons to
surrender and that the torpedp by
which she was struck was *f German
manufacture. In the view of the gov­
ernment of the United States, these
facts from the first made the con­
clusion that the torpedo was fired by
a German submarine unavoidable. It
now considers that conclusion sub­
stantiated by the statements of Your
Excellency's note. A full statement
of the facts upon which the United
States has based its conclusion is en­
closed.
