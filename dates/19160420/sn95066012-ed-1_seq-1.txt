Ambassador Confers With Secre
tary Lansing.Today
CRISIS IN WAITING STAGE
Another Week May See an Extension
of Passports and Recall of
Gerard.
Washington, April 20. Ambassador
von Bernstorff today discussed with
secretary or state Lanstng the pos
sibility of averting a break of relations
between Germany and the United
States. The ambassador refused fo
give any of the details of the confer
ence but he expressed himself as far
from hopeless, lie stated that he ex
pected to receive Instructions from
Berlin early next week, although num
erous conferences over the latest note
and the president's message to con
gress would be necessary.
Washington, April 20. Germany has
been solemnly warned by President
Wilson that diplomatic relations will
be severed by the United States unless
Germany "shall now immediately de
clare and effect an abandonment of
Its present methods of submarine war
fare against passenger and freight
carrying vessels."
This warning, of the deepest signi
ficance and carrying the possibility of
ultimate war, was given in similar
words in the president's speech yester
day afternoon before the joint session
of Congress and in a note sent to Em
bassador Gerard at Berlin for trans
mission to the German foreign ofllce,
the text o which was made public last
evening.
The president considers that the
next Btep depends solely upon Ger
many, and that three or four days con
stitute a reasonable time for a reply,
although no time is set in what
amounts almost to an ultimatum.
He 1b willing to discuss how subma
rine warfnra might be conducted with
in the limits of International law and
humanity after Germany abandons her
present methods, but the violation of
International law by submarines will
jnean the severance of diplomatic rela
tions, with Increased possibility of war
as only one modern instance Germ
any and Italy exists in which this ac
tion has not been followed by war.
The note to Germany sets forth the
belief that a German submarine sank
the channel steamer Sussex, and an ap
pendix to the note sets forth the evl
dence available.
Had the recent attack on the chan
nel steamer Sussex, the note tells Ger
many, been an Isolated case, the Unit
ed States might have hoped that the
submarine commander acted in viola
tion of his government's solemn
pledges and that the ends of justice
might have been satisfied by a dis
avowal, reparation, and his proper
punishment. But, It adds, this case
"unhappily does not stand alone."
The appendix shows that three
American army and navy officers
found In the hull of the destroyed ship
screw-bolts which correspond in use
and indentificatlon marks with those
on German torpedoes In possession of
the French government at the naval
station at Toulon, and 13 pieces of
metal which they have identified as
parts of German torpedoes. Four of
them still bear the distinctive red
paint common to German torpedo "war
heads." Besides this evidouce, the
note contends, every circumstance
either admittod by Germany in her
disclaimer or proved by affidavit of
persons on the destroyed liner proves
beyond question that she was tor
pedoed without warning.
Congress recived the president's
declaration of his course with mixed
evidences of concern and approbation
Most of the leaders, democratic and
republican, thought the president hard
ly could do less and some expressed
the opinion that his action would not
lead to war. Republican Leader Mann
alone of all the opposition leaders
openly attacked the president for his
stand. He characterized it as politl
cal play.
copies or me American note were
sent to representatives at Washing
ton of neutral nations, on the assump
tion that they are as much Interest
ed as the United States In the protec
tion of neutral rights. The document
was not given to any of the belligerent
diplomats, as the controversy Is re
garded as being solely between the
United States and Germany.
Count von Bernstorff already has
reiterated to Secretary Lansing that
under no circumstances will Germany
give up the submarine us a weapon of
warfare, because she contends it Is a
retaliation for Great Britain's food
blockade. The embassador has de
clared, however, that his government
will attempt to bring submarine oper
atlons within the law of nations. This
the United Slates is willing to discuss
after Oermnny hod abandoned her
present methods not before.
The crisis now resolves itself Into
the waiting stage during which Ger

sary of Vermont joining the Union
St.-'I a no more appropriate program
, 1 K ..!.... " T .

Public - Association. May 2nd.
This Is an... from Dorothy Fisher
Canfield's "Ariuigton in 1791" which
was presented so successfully at Ar
lington some time ago, but which has
been enlarged upon to make a full eve
ning's entertainment with the intro
duction of additional features that will
make it one of the most novel enter
tainments ever presented by local tal
ent in Bennington.
The scene is laid in Arlington in the
log house of one early settler, Mr.
Burton, in the year 1791, the occasion
being Thanksgiving day with a reunion
of the family and friends who with
their conversation full of Yankee wit
and humor impart some early Vermont
history and as Mr. Burton expresses it,
in a way that's a durn sight different
than the history books tell It."
The great issue at that time, the
question as to whether erinont
should join the Union or remain an in
dependent nation, is the foremost topic
of discussion and the old fashioned ob
stinacy of "Granny Baker" in her loy
alty to King George and the Spirit, of
70 in the hearts of the younger gener
ations, call forth many arguments and
amusing situations that not only
amuse, but give us in an entertaining
way conditions and customs of Ver
mont at that time. After the dinner
the guests take part in a varied pro
gram each number of which Is entirely
in keeping with the time of the play.
There are 32 people in the cast, be
ing coached by Mrs. Arthur Elliot anJ
judging from the rehearsals already
held, Bennington will take her place
well forward again in the production
of amateur theatricals.
SCHILLER ON WAY TO PRISON
Is Highly Pleased That He Was
Not
Sent to England.
Wilmington, Del., April 1!). Ernest
Schiller, alias Clarence It. Hudson,
who recently held up the Captain and
crew of iil'ty-sb: men of the British
freighter Matoppo on the high seas,
was on his way today to the Federal
prison at Atlanta in custody of United
States Marshals. Schiller yesterday
pleaded guilty to a eliarr.P of piracy
and was sentenced to serve a life term.
Before leaving here last night Schil
ler declared that his desire for revenge
against England had prompted his act.
At the same time, lie said, he hoped to
do something "for the cause of Ger
many". He denied that robbery had
been his motive, and said that the
chief reason of his plan to sink the
Matoppo had failed because he did
not want to kill anybody.
When 1 took charge of the ship,'
he said, "It was so rouuli that it would
have been murder to have forced the
crew to get out in small boats, as 1
had at first intended them to do."
Schiller said he was "highly
pleased" that he was not being sent to
England.

Mysterious Fire Burns Shops of

TAHTED BY AN EXPLOSION
Plant Was Engaged in Making Shells
for the Allies Loss is Set at
About $25,000.
Rutland, April 20. Fire of a some
what mysterious origin yesterday de
stroyed one of the buildings of the F.
R. Patch Manufacturing company s
plant in which work on munitions for
the entente allies has been in progress
for some months. The lives' of the
100 or more men who were In the. build
in;j when the lire broke out wore en
dangered by the explosion of a large
tanii containing oil lor use in temper
ing shells. No one was injured, al
though the escapes of several working
near the oil tank bordered on the
miraculous.
A report thut the fire was caused
by the dipping of an overheated shell
into the oil was characterized as very
unlikely by F. R. Patch, president of
the company, in a statement last night.
"The fire was caused by an explo
sion, the nature of which we do, not
know." was all the president would
say when asked for his opinion as to
the probable cause of the fire.
The building. 150 feet long and 60
feet wide, was completely destroyed
The damage, which will amount to at
least $25,000. is well covered by In
surance. The structure housed a wood-working
shop in audition to the room con
taining the apparatus for making
sheik'.
The fact that there was little or no
wind blowing at the time probably
prevented a much more disastrous
fire. As it was. many other buildings
lu the neighborhood, including six
dwelling houses, caught fire from
spatk- or from the intense heat to
which they wefe subjected These-,..
were saved only by the haraest kind
of work by the city fire department.
