Washingt. n. April 20. The United
States having said its last word to

versy, today turned with prave ex

rierlmon whether the imperial Rovern

warfare, or sever diplomatic relations
with Washington.
President Wilson probably will wait
until the end of the week for Germany
to reply to his virtual ultimatum,
which declares the intention of the
United States to sever diplomatic re
lations unless tlie German govern
ment gives up th- use of submarines
against commerce and squares her
submarine policy with the principles
of humanity and internal ional law.
No time limit was set in the communi

reasonable length of time for Germany
to reach a decision.

NOTHING TO IT
State Journal Has 'ot Organ
ized Roosevelt Propaganda
As Charged in Article in Morn
ing Capital.
The following special dispatch ap-
i peared in this morning's Topeka Capi
tal under a Hiawatha date with a
head line over it saying that " 'Cussin
Tom Smith is Opposed to Roosevelt."
The item is wholly and absolutely
untrue so far as its reflections on the
publisher of the State Journal are
concerned, and no other publisher
could have been in the mind of the
correspondent.
This paper cannot believe that Mr.
Smith should have authorized any
such statements for they are wholly
false, so far as reference to Mr. Mac
Lennan is concerned, with the one
minor exception, that Mr. Smith did
receive a letter from him. Here is
the false piece of news circulated by
the Hiawatha correspondent, whoever
he is:
"Himviitha, April 19. Todav 'Cussin'
loiu Smith, of lliuwutha, one of the dele-gates-nt-large
to the Republican national
rouveiitiou, received a letter from a Topeka
publisher who lias recently orgauizc-d a
itoosevelt propaganda. The letter request
ed that Smith support Koosevelt at the
rtwnlrg convention and stated that a sim
ilar rc.juest had been made to all the other
delegates. Smith's reply was that Uoose
velfa own utterances during the past four
yeara most surely would remove him even
iia a possible candidate for the nomina
tion." in the first place the publisher of
i his paper has not "recently organ
ised Roosevelt Propaganda." We have
absolutely no authority, directly or
indirectly, from Colonel Roosevelt or
any of his friends to do anything of
the sort. Colonel Roosevelt and lone
of his friends knew anything about
the editorial until after it appeared or
that its writing was planned. The ar-
tide was written as an independent.
honest expression that the writer felt
should be made at that particular
time, last Friday, April 14.
In the next place, the letter did not
request mat mr. Smith support !
Itoosevelt at the coming convention." !
The letter absolutely did nothing of
the sort.
Neither did the letter state, as the!
C pital item says:
"That a similar request had been t
made to all the other delegates." Now
here is the letter, word for word, just :
as it was written, and the reader can
see the injustice done the editor of
this paper by the effort to compromise
him or his friends, by the publication
of such an item:
"Topeka. April 17, W16.
"Mr. T. T. Smith, Hiawatha, Kansas.
"My Ieur Sir :
"I am em-losing a section of the State
Journal of Friday last, containing an edi
torial on the political situation.
"While you may not agree with me, I
hope you will go over the article arefully.
It is submitted as food for thought.
"If the spirit moves you to write me a
note as to how the article impresses you,
whither favorably or not. I would appre
ciate It. Yours verv trulv,
(Signed.) "FRANK 1'. MACLENNAN."
The State Journal people are fairly
well acquainted with Mr. Tom Smith,
and have not been unfriendly to him;
in fact, we knew that at one time Mr.
Smith, just like the editor of this
paper was at one time, favorable to
Colonel Roosevelt for the Presidency.
The State Journal regretted that the
colonel ran for the office in 1912, but
it did not lose its admiration, nor its
proprietor his friendship, for him, nor
hold other views than that he was
and is today our greatest American,
the biggest statesman and the best
: equipped man for the presidency.
Now, the writer was under the im
pression that it was perfectly proper
to submit to Mr. Smith any new lieht
there might be upon the subject, or
that might call to his notice the won
derful trend and tide that is setting
! in, in Kansas and all over this country,
toward Col. Theodore Roosevelt as
the man of the hour. It was thought
: that possibly even Mr. Smith, like the
i writer, might have a change of heart,
i in view of changing conditions. Mr.
: Smith is an uninstructed delegate and
j presumably has an open mind on the
subject, and will cast his vote at the
proper time, in the way in which he
; believe:- he may best serve his coun
try and his party when the Republican
i convention meets In Chicago in June.
1 The editor of the State Journal has
not heard from Colonel Roosevelt.
; personally, directly or indirectly, since
; his return from the West Indies.
So far as the State Journal knows
Colonel Roosevelt may favor the nom
ination of Justice Hughes. Were con
ditions normal in this country; were
I diplomatic relations satisfactory; were
our relations with Mexico and foreign
countries not in a strained condition
extending over a long period of time,
were the Brandeis incident not to the
fore, and other new lately developed
situations presented. Hughes might be
ideal. We think Roosevelt the man
now. That's an opinion not an inci
dent to any propaganda,
Up to a short time ago. the State
Journal confesses, it believed Justice
Hughes the man; not now, however,
good as he is.

Washington, April -0. Official ad- ;
vices to the state department today
noting recent movements of Carranza
troops from Chihuahua, to the Parral
region, caused some concern among
administration officials. The dis
patches expressed the opinion the ;
movement was intended as a hint to
the American forces that they might
expect at least a show of opposition if
they sought to penetrate further into !
Mexico than their present position. It :
was added, however, that there was
every indication the movement was '
made without the knowledge or con
sent of General Carranza or his war
minister. General Obregon.
No estimates as to the number of
men involved was communicated, i
Officials, however, basing their fig- I
ures on previous reports as to the
strength of various Carranza garrteons 1
in the vicinity believe it could not j
have exceeded 1,500 men. According
to the dispatches it was the purpose of r
the commander who ordered the move
to establish the force south of the
most advanced position of General ;
Pershing's troops near Parral.
Carranza Can't Con t red Men.
The most important aspect In the
official viewpoint here, it was inti
mated, is the indication that the de
facto government has not full control 1
over all its military forces. The war
department has been wit hout direct
advices from the American troops in
the Parral region for several days.
Messages to the state department,
however, have indicated there has
been additional cause for alarm as to
the situation.
It was learned authoritatively toda '
that the United States has Already
acknowledged through special ager.t !

General Carranza's note suggesting the

The state is preparing to violate a
few more sacred state laws in its es
tablishment of the new film censor
ship room in the sub-basement of the
state house. A room without fire
exits, without outside exits of any de
scription and with picture machines
unprotected by booths are some of the
features of the new state picture show
shop. In several ways the state will
manage to violate its own laws.
Massive stone walls, heavy steel
doors, concrete floors, unprotected
and leaky steam and sewer pipes, a
thin, sickly coat of whitewash, steel
barred outside '"exits;" those are fea
tures of the new picture display room
in the state house which tend to make
the quarters as homelike and inviting
as a deserted monastery. The quar
ters were established under order and
direction of Superintendent Ross, in
charge of the film censorship for the
state. The censors Mr. Ross not in
cluded must work in the damp, dan
gerous room or quit their jobs.
Visitors may find the new state
censorship qua rters by use of a
chart or diagram of the .ub-basement.
Today John McBee. state house guide,
led a couple of visitors to the room,
lie took the visitors down winding
wooden stairs, along a rambling walk
that led past rubbish and scrap heaps
which the state has accumulated and
stored in the building without the
knowledge of the ordinary visitor.
Sometimes They l-cak.
"You will have to be careful down
here," warned MeBee, wno had the
interests of his charges at hear.
"Watch those pipes. They leak some
times and I got an awful scalding
down here one day."
Then McBee piloted the visitors to a
massive stone walled cellar in the
southwest wing of t he sub-bitsement.
"That's it." McBee explained with a
wave of his hand. McBee was right.
That w is "it."

"It is difficult to suppose that Ger

the Chronicle. "Diplomatic relations
between Berlin and Washington will
then be broken.
'The resulting situation, of course,
will not be a state of war, but may
easily develop into one if Germany
perpetrates fresh atrocities in which
the victims include Americans.
"This is most obvious to both par -
ties. President Wilson has counted
