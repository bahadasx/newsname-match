MEN'S CIVIC LEAGUE
-ORGANIZED APRIL 13TH
At a well attended meeting held
in the office of Attorney Gold,
last Thursday night, the perma
nent organization of the Men's
Civic League of 'Williams, was
organized. Officers were elected
and the membership divided into
departments for special work.
In general plan this organiza
tion is modeled to some extent,
after the "Woman's Club of Wil
liams. ,The work of some of its
departments, too, is almost iden
tical with that of some of the de
partments of the Woman's Club
and it is planned to have these
departments co-operate with like
departments of the Woman's
Club, to work for the betterment
of the community.
The permanent officers elected
at this meeting are:' President,
F. E. Wells; First Vice President,
T. H. Cureton; Second Vice Pres
ident, C. -H. Appleton; Third
Vice President, I. P. McConkey;
Secretary-treasurer, R. I. Mona
han. The three initial depart
ments organized are: the Law
and Order Department, the Boys
Department and the Municipal
Improvement Department. The
Vice President is, by virtue of
his office, president of the Law
and Order Department, the Sec
ond Vice President is president
of the Boys' Department and the
Third Vice President is president
of the Municipal Improvement
League.
It was the sense of the meeting
tjhat the Law and Order Depart
ment should be pushed most act
ively during the first month,, al
tho both of the other depart
ments will hold meetings . and
plan their work for the year.
The object of the organization,
as expressed in its constitution,
is: to aid in the enforcement of
tne town ordinances and the laws
of the state, to engage in active
work to improve the environ
ment and influences to which the
boys of the community are sub
jected, and to work in such other
ways for municipal improvement
as the organization may deem ad
visable. Membership in the organiza
tion is open to all who thereby
endorse its' purposes and desire
to work actively with it to help
attain its object. Any person de
siring to join in the good work
should give their name to one of
the present members and have it
presented at the next meeting for
acceptance.
The Law and Order Depart
ment is actively i at work and ex
pects to have good results to show
for their efforts, in the near fu
ture. Any officer who does his
full duty in the way of - law en
forcement may depend upon the
hearty co-operation of this de
partment and of the general or
ganization. The Boy's Department plans
to organize as many of the boys
of the town under the age of
eighteen, into a scout troop, as
may be possible. A meeting of
the boys will be held in the near
future and with the co. operation
of this department it is hoped
that the Scouts may accomplish
many times more than they suc
ceeded in accomplishing last sum
mer. The Municipal Improvement
Department will co-operate with
the Town Council and the gen
eral public in an effort to im
prove the town in every way pos
sible. Street improvement is one
of the first things to which they
will give their attention. They
are considering the matter of oil-
TWO JUGGED ON GHARGE
OF SELLING BOOZE
Marshall Bobby Burns picked
up two suspicious looking colored
gentlemen of leisure last Saturday,
who had in their possession
twenty-five bottles of booze. They
confessed to having left Needles
with thirty-six. Ten bottles had
been stolen from their trunk, they
said, and one broken. After a con
fidential talk with the two,' before
the town attorney, F. M. Gold.,
the county attorney's office waB
consulted. The two coons were
then let go for a few days, and
later arrested by deputy sheriff, M.
C. Smith. When arrested they had
but thirteen bottles left.
Summond before judge Twitty,
the two claimed that they had been
robbed of the twelve missing quarts,
before their eyes, by men from all
over town. They were bound over
to appear before the Superior Court.
The evidence seems strong and a
conviction will probably result

Things are getting warm in the
Boy's Subscription Contest and
why should'nt they? The prizes
now on 'display are every one of
them worth working hard for and
there are just enough contestants to
make the race interesting. Besides
the nine boys named in last week's
News, one more has been added,
Eugene Smith. "Gene"' as he is
commonly called, has made an ex
cellent showing for one week.
Of the old contestants Jerry Duf
field, Allan Montgomery, Raymond
Haynes, James Callan, Oscar Tyler
and Glen Moore have done work to
be proud of. All they need to do
is to keep right at it for the re
maining seven weeks and each of
them will be sure of a ' fitting re
ward. Some of the other contest
ants are going to be favorably heard
from next week, while some of
them fail to understandthe meaning
of such words as "work" "hustle"
and "persistence. " By the end' of
the contest we will not be able to
see these few who are entered for
the race because of the dust left by
the others.
Make this your slogan, boys,
"Land a Sub Daily". See to it
that you do not let a single day
go by without at least one attempt,
and each of you will be made
happy at the end of the contest, by
receiving a prize well worth all of
your effort.
