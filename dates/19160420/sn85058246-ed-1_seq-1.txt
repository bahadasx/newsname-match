Spencer Churchill, and tho possibility
of Mr. Ltoyd-Georgo succeeding Mr.

and threatening, thero also aro strong
forces making for the retention oi
tho present coalition ministry-first,
Mr. Asqulth's known skill In sur

NELSON A8 A COURTIER
Nelson was tho hero of England
oven in his own time, but not appar
ently of tho court. Samuel Rogers
recounts, a conversation with him
which appears In tho llfo of tho poet
by R. Ellis Roberts. "I heard him
once during dinner," says Rogers,
utter many bitter complaints (which
Lady Hamilton vainly attempted to
check) of tho way ho had been treat
ed at court that forenoon tho queen
lind not condescended to tako tho
slightest notlco of him.
In truth, Nelson was hated at court
they wero Jealous of him." But then
it must bo remembored that Rogors
was renowned as a particularly ill
naturcd gossip.
Good Health Recipe.
Asked onco to what ho attributed
his remarkable health and youthful
nppcaranco, tho lato Lord Alvorstono,
British ox-lord chief Justlco, who died
at tho ago ot so;enty-throo, repllod,
"Early to bod, oarly to rise, and proper
physical oxorctso."
R, L. Hnrmon, manager of the
Thatcher Music Co., has been work
ing over tlmo to put his now music

Wo aro quite suro that every person
who takes occasion to visit tho now
storo upon tho Invitation of tho man
agement they will pronounco It ono

We enn say that thoro has been no
expense spared in putting their storo

EVANGELIST
CONTINUES HIS
PREACHING
$1000 for a text from tho word of
God for Sunday keeping, Is an offor
mndo by a Catholic priest, nnd U
still good, said Evangelist M. A.
Holllster at tho S. D. A. church
and then ho stntcd farther that tho
Catholic church claim that ovuryono
who worships on that day aro bow
lug down In rovorcut obcdlcnco tn
tho commands of tholr church mid
this Is true for thoy onlv, according
to history, changed tho day and In
union with heathenism, forced It on
tho world, and now tho wor'd fights
for It. Mr. Holllster read tho idght
texts found In tho Blblo, that speak
of tho first day of tho week and not
onco Is thero ndvnnced tho Men of
sacrodncBH, but In most of thoso
texts tho fact Is stated that the Sab
bath Immediately preceded tho Mrst
day.
After showing that tho Sabbath Is
tho memorial or birthday of Creation
tho speaker said It was Just ns Im
possible to ehnngo tho day, ns to
chango our own birthdays, for this
could net bo accomplished unless wo
had another birth, and tho chango
of tho Sabbath would lnvolvo imothnr
creation, nnd tho destruction ot this
world nnd oven then tho hlstorv of
this world would stato that tho hov
enth day was the Sabbath.
Ono vory good renson why Ibo
chango wns attempted, tho Fpcikor
said was found In Daniel 7:23-25
whero an npostato power would i.t
tompt tho chango of God's law nnd
would spenk great words against tho
Most High, thereforo overyouo who
supports this chango Is supporting
that apostate power, and opposing
God.
