It Is the Part of Common Prudence to'
Prepare For Protection
By ATLFJE POMERENE. Senator From Ohio
a
WHEN dangers arise in our municipalities or in our states, as prudent
men we increase our means of protection against riot and disorder.
Ought we not for the same reason, when some of the belligerents
are sinking vessels in violation of every principle of international law and \
humanity and other belligerents are interfering with our commerce un
der the plea of military necessity, have a reasonably sufficient navy and
annv to protect the lives and property of our people against the aggres
sions of nations that are PAYING NO RESPECT FOR THE RULES
WHICH CONTROL THE INTERCOURSE AMONG THE FAMILY
OF NATIONS?
1 hope war may never come, but 1 would regard myself as derelict in
the duty I owe to the people of the state and nation if I did not heed the
lesson of the hour and provide accordingly. If unfortunately we should
become involved in war within the next three or four years and were
not prepared what criticism would be heaped upon the heads of the leg
islature and executive departments if we had failed in the face of the
warnings we have had of impending dangers!
I AM BPEAKING ONLY OF PREPAREDNESS FOR DEFENSE. I AM
OPPOSED TO PREPARATION FOR A W»R OF AGGRESSION.
