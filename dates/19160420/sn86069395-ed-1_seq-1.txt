Harry Sommers is fishing again
this season, but not in the Gulf of
Mexico.
It would be a pity to have to send
von Bernstorff home. We've learned
to like him.
There arg indications that we will
stop seining" for mTiuiowyiTf "Maxlch,
for awhile at least.
The Williams impeachment trial
drags its slow length along at an ex
pense of $500 a day.
That Villa story didn't fool any
body. Funston is from Kansas and
Kansas adjoins Missouri.
Roosevelt's plans are being careful
ly laid to capture two nominations for
President at Chicago, in June.
If we have to handle two wars at
-once, we might turn Mexico over to
Texas. The Lone Star boys did
it once.
The French have captured the sub
" marine which torpedoed the Sussex
and have made prisoners the captain
and crew.
Forty-two seniors of Princeton Un
iversity say they have never been
kissed. The strange part is that all
but 42 should have 'fessed up. -
The pursuit of Villa is at a tempor
ary halt while matters of more im
portance arc being settled at Wash
ington. Villa has escaped, most
likely with the aid of Carranza forces.
It would be just as well to occupy
Vera Cruz and other ports, to remain
until. Carranza makes good his boast
that he can catch Villa.

STREET OIL
AND WATER
Two Sets of Advocates Have
Widely Divergent
Views.
SOME ONE) SOME OTHER
Water Advocates in tKe Ma
jority at Monday Night
Meeting.
A meeting of tho residents, oh
South Main and South Virginia
streets, was held at the H. B. M. A.
Monday iiighl to consider the dust
situation.
Last yea"r the territory from 12th
street south to and including Alumnae
avenuewas sprinkled by contract by
M. C. Boyd & Co., for about $1,100,
each property owner paying $8. The
sprinklers ran twice a day on week
days and once on Sunday.
There were 55 persons represented
in the meeting Monday night and 34
voted for water sprinkling again and
21 for oil. Tho same contract made
tost year can be made again this year
for water, but there is much differ
ence of opinion on tho kind of sprink
ling. Nearly all of the property
owners on Main street out to 17th
prefer oil and someiare very emphat
ic in saying that tKey will not take
water at any price. Other citizens in
the same territory and beyond say
they will not have the oil at any price.
These, however, are exceptions and
most of the people are willing to take
whichever the majority votes for.
Nothing was accomplished at the
meeting held, except committcse
were appointed to canvass tho terri
tory and get ,an expression from all
who were absent. The water advo
cates will try to raise the required
amount, even if they have to pay for
those who refuse to help. The oil
advocates from 12th to 17th streets
are planning to get an estimate on the
cost of oil for 5,000 square yards,
about 2,500 to 3,000 gallons for one
application and the same quantity for
a second application' In the fall. The
last time street oil was purchased
here the price was a little less than 6
cents delivered and shipment were
made in 6,000-gaIlon tanks.

t In the hall of the house of repre

night under the auspices of the Doug
lass Club. Ned Turner, President,
presided and Walter Robinson intro
duced the speaker. Blakemore's
orchestra made music.
Simmons is an orator of recognized
ability and his speech was an appeal
to tho colored people to have higher
ideals in cverv way and to make of
themselves useful, respectable and
honored citizens as so many have
done here in Hopkinsville. He also
pleaded for harmony and mutual sym
pathy between the races, showing
how this has always existed in indi
vidual instances as each whito man
ha one or more negroes upon whom
he relies implicitly for help when he
needs it and every colored man has a
whito man friend to who ho goes
when in need or trouble. But he
urged that the good conditions not
stop there but bo extended to take in
tho two races as a whole.
In closing he complimented Phil
Brown, saying ho was a prominent
figuro in his race not only in Hop
kinsville or Kentucky but of tho na
tion.

VON BERNSTORFF STILL OPTI
MISTIC. When the ambassador learned of
arrangement for the joint session pf
congress he apparently was as much
surprised as the remainder of official
Washington. Optimistic throughout,
even when the diplomatic negotiations
seemed in tight corners and the much
discussed break appeared to be im
minent, the ambassador's confidence
remained unshaken that friendly re
lations between his country and the
United States would continue. He
expressed his opinion that everything
would come out all right in the end.
Administration officials reflected
President Wilson's determination to
not eventually been lollowed by war,
It is the breaking of relations between
Germany and Italy, and it stands
alone as a precedent against what
diplomatists regard as inevitable.

Fortress Reported to Have
Been Garrisoned by 54,
000 Men.
Petrograd, April 19. Trcbizontl,
the most important Turkish city on
the Black sea, has been captured by
the Russians.
The fall of the city is confirmed in
an official communication issued late
today.
IMPORTANT PORT IN BLACK SEA
Trebizond is a city of Asia Minor on
the Black sea, 575 miles east of Con
stantinople and 100 miles north of
Erzorum, the town stormed by Rus
sians on Feb. 1G. Trebizond has a
population of about 40,000, including
some 18,000 Christians.
The importance of the Black sea
port was due to its command of the
port where the chief trade route from
Persia and central Asia descends to
the sea. It is separated from the rest
of Asia Minor by a barrier of rugged
mountains, 7,000 to 8,000 feet high,
which the Russian armies had to
traverse.
Aided by the Russian fleet, the in
vaders pushed past the last series of
natural obstacles along the coast when,
on Sunday, they occupied a strongly
foitih'ed Turkish position on the left
bank of the Kara Dere, 12 miles out
side of the fortress.
Since the fall of Erzerum and tho
capture three weeks later of Bitlis the
Turks are said to have increased Uie
Trebizond garrison until it contained
three complete divisions, or about
54,000 men, and to have done every
thing possible to strengthen the Black
sea port.
