in his criti
cisms, the latter, who is still at
Washington, wrote as follows to
President Wilson with a view to
having the statements of Mr.
Moorhead investigated and like
wise his actions in connection with
Chippewa matters:
Washington, D. C.
April 10, 1916.
To the President
of the United States:
"It has become my duty as
an authorized delegate and lepre
sentative of the Chippewas of
Minnesota to submit to jou cer
tain matters which I do, because I
believe they cannot be dealt with
in any other way, and give the In
dians relief.
Mr. Warren K. Moorhead, a
member of the Board of Indian
Commissioners, has recently writ
ten letters to members of Con
gress containing statements evi
dently intended to destroy any
usefulness that the delegates of
tbe Minnesota Chippewas may
have in connection with pending
legislation, affecting their tribal
matters. These statements, I be
lieve you can easily convince your
self, are false and libelous While
his attacks are direot^d immediate
ly at me, they are not confined to
mc, but impugn the motives and
reflect injuriously upon the charac
ter of other delegates appointed
by the Chippewa General Coun
cil, vho returned to Minnesota
some weeks ago.
Because of the great harm Mr.
Moorhead worked among the i
White Earth Chippewas in Minne-1
sota some years ago, inciting them
to dishonest and debasing methods i
of trickery in connection with the
sale of their individual allotments
of land, I took occasion in my
newspaper, THK TOMAHAVK.

NST
THE GHIPPEWA
Warren K. Moorhmd Las been
making strenuous, efforts to pre
vent one, and possibly two, of the
amendments now I the Indian ap
propriation bill relating to the
Chippewas of Minnesota, from be
ing passed by Cougress. This has
resulted in some protes's being
filed by the officers of the General
Council with members of Congress
against Mr. Moorhead's actions.
It was learned recently that Mr.
Moorhead was placed upon the ex
ecutive committee of the Indian
Kights Association, but on account
of his interference outside of his
duties as such officer, he was let
out of the committee.
The Indian Kights Association
will not tolerate any member of
its executive committee mixing up
in the factional differences of In
dian tribes.
Mr. Moorhead wrote letters to a
number of the members of Con-
g*es#*Wfcfrft 'opposed -nearJy
everything the"delegates of the
General Council did during the
past winter at Washington, and as
he particulurly named the publish

criticise his official work in un I
measured terms, anl this he. hasjustify

mv associates, members of the
Chippewa bands of Minnesota, in
a secret fashion. I believed then
and believe now, that his influence
upon the Indians was calculated to
debauch their manhood, and to
lower the Government in their
eyes.
It is evident that if anyone who
holds the official position that Mr.
Moorhead docs, is free to make
clandestine attacks upon the dele
gates of the tribe, especially in
their representative capacity, the
efficiency of the delegates can
easily be destroyed here at Wash
ington.
Mr. Moorhead, in his letter,
charires among other things that 1
am maintaining a lobby here. I
m-ike it a rule to meet openly
every charge against me, and if
the fact that I have devoted my
time here every winter for the
pist twenty years in the interests
of the Chippewas of Minnesota,
and have sought to procure such
legislation for them as seemed
best, is a matter of blame I will
willingly bear it but no member
of a committee of Congress can
say 1 have ever approached him in
behalf of any other tribe than my
o^ n, and no member of such com
mittee can say that I have misin
formed him about Chippewa mat
ters. 1 have tried to render assi-t
ance in procuring legislation for
the protection of the beat interests
of the Chippewas, and such as 1
have been directed to do by their
Councils at home.
In one case at least, the Mille
L'ic case, we succeeded in obtain
ing leave to go to the Court of
Chums and to the Supreme Courtx"
of tbe United States, and obtained
a Judgment of over $700,000.
in 1906 a law was passed which
permitted adult mixed-blood Chip
pewas of the White Earth Reser
vation to alienate their allotments
of land. As a result several hund
red thousand acres of land were
thrown upon the market.
It transpired, as was to be ex
pected, that some minors and
others who afterwards claimed to
be full bloods, sold their allot
ments upon their own representa
tions under oath, that they were
adult mixed bloods.
About this time Mr. Moorhead
it seems, happened to come to De
troit, Minnesota, on a pleasure
trio and learned of conditions on
the White Earth Reservation. He
immediately returned to Washing
ton and obtained an appointment
as Special United States Indian
Agent, went back to Minnesota
and spQnt
the summer on the
White Earth Reservation.
Soon afterwards he was quoted
throughout the Reservation as au
thority for the statement that who
ever had sold his allotment could
recover it, if he would make an
affidavit that he was a full-blood,
and thus annul the effect of pre
vious affidavits made when he
alienated bis lands and received
the consideration for the same.
I must say in defence of a large
majority of mixed-bloods, that
they did not avail themselves of
any such dishonest means, but
stood by their bargains. Many
others, however, trusting in Mr.
Moorhead, who bad come into
their midst with official sanction
and authority, were weak enough
to sell their manhood for the
promise that wad held out to them,
and hundreds of foolish, almost
vicious, suits were started by M.
C. Burch of the Department of
Justice during President Taft's
administration.
The results of these suits thus
far and after more than six years
the terms by which I des
them.
One of the things that developed
in connection with Mr. Moorhead's
relations to the Minnesota Chip
pewas was the fact that he sought
to use his influence while at the
White Earth Reservation to secure
personal employment as tribal at
torney for the Chippewas, and,
failing at that, then tried to have
his friend, Mr. Alien of Massachu
setts, appointed to the position.
The majority of the White
E*rth Chippewas know the false
ness of Mr. Moorhead's pretensi
ons, and they repudiate him andand
his interference in their tribal
affairs.
The Minnesota Chippewas of
the White Earth Reservation
claim, and deserve, recognition as
an intelligent body of citizens, and
I respectfully submit should be
free from tbe injury that such
men as Mr. Moorhead in official
capacity impose by meddling in
their affairs.
In 1913, the Chippewas of Min
nesota, with the knowledge, and I
believe, with the approval of the
Secretary of the Interior, organiz
ed a tribal council, known as the
''General Council of Minnesota
Chipp8was."
A Constitution was
adopted by the Council providing
for representation according to
population of the respective Res
ervations for an annual meeting
of the Council for the election of
regular officers and committees,
including an executive committee.
The proceedings of the Council
are fairly conducted the Presi
dent, John G. Morrison Jr., a
member of the tribe, is a success-
fuT merchant, and his predecessor
in pffi.ee, the Honorable .JJdward
T&jgers, now County Attorney
of Cass County, Minnesota, is a
candidate for Congress in his Dis
trict. He also is a member of the
tribe.
The Chippewas of Minnesota
number over eleven thousand per
sons they are citizens of Minneso
ta and of the United States many
of them are highly educated, liv
ing in all respects like the better
classes of non-Indian people in
towns and rural districts through
out western states and many of
them are men of large means and
fine business ability, some of them
hold important public offices, both
State and Federal.
Congress has recognized the
Council, and twice appropriated
tribal funds from the Treasury of
the United States to their credit,
to meet the expenses of the Coun
cil.
In the Indian Appropriation
Bill, now pending in Congress,
there is a provision for an appro
priation from Chippewa tribal
funds for the further expenses of
the annual Councils for last year
and this year which was put into
the bill at the request of the Chip
pewa delegation attending this
Congress. After all the delegates

'Truth before Favor."
White Earth, Becker County, Minnesota, Thursday, April 20, 1916.
except myself had departed for
home, and I was left to look after
these matters, Mr. Moorhead
wrote certain members of the Sen
ate Indian Committee, letters, con
taining the false assertions above
referred to, and having for their
purpose the defeat of the appro
priation for the expenses of the
Council.
If Mr. Moorhead had come be
fore the Senate Committee when
the Chippewa delegation was here,
openly presented his objection
and his authority for interference
in Chippewa tribal matters, the
delegation could have told the
Committee whether what he al
leged was true or not, and it would
have been possible to arrive at his
motives, better then than now .t
the methods that he edopts cast a
doubt upon his integrity in this
matter, and lead to the suspicion
that his actions are based purely
upon personal prejudices against
some of the members of the dele
gation.
Mr. Moorhead's position as a
member of the Board of Indian
Commissioners gives him certain
prestige in Indian matters which
an ordinary person would rot
have, and as he is evidently using
his position to gratify his preju
dices and to punish those who have
criticised his methods in regard to
their matters, I would respectfully
request, on behalf of the Chippe
was whom I represent, that his
motives for opposing the appro
priations asked for by the Chip
pewa delegation from their tribal
funds, be investigated."

FOR UNITED STATES
SENATOR, MOSES E.
CLAPP,
ID a recent issue of the Minne
apolis Tribune a special from the
Washington correspondent to that
paper published stated that Sen
ator Clapp's candidacy for re
nomination for the United States
senate was uncertain. Many mis
statements appeared in the article
which the friends of Senator
Clapp knew were not true. It
was not a matter of reliable news,
but it was slipped into the columns
of THK TOMAHAWK
knowledge of the editor.
That Sei Clai will be a cand
date to succeed himself there need
be no question in the minds of his
constituents throughout this state.
That he baa failed to fito for the
nomination is not evidence that he

Senator Clapp was one of Col.
Roosevelt's staunchest supporters
at the lat presidential election,
and as only an accident can now
prevent the latter"s nomination as
president on the Republican ticket
this year, the natural result will
be the renomination of Senator
Clapp.
