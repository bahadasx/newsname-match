THE ARMY TITLE ORIGINS
Names of Official Positions Go Back |
to Greek and Roman Days—Some
Curious Derivatives.
An article on the origin of the names
of weapons of war has led us to specu
late Idly on the origin of rank in the
array, with more or less interesting re
sults.
We find that “private” comes from
the Latin “prlvatus,” moaning de
prived. Probably that's because the
humble private is deprived of the priv
ileges of his officers; or maybe it is
because he is deprived of his freedom.
At any rate the Latin term is prettier
than the Greek. The Greek private
soldier was called "idiotes” and he
was supposed to be so ignorant that
we derive the word “Idiot’’ from him.
"Corporal" is corrupted from “cap
oral” and its root is the same as that
of "captain,” from “caput,” a head. The
corporal is a sort of head private, in
theory. A sergeant is higher rank, but
the derivation of his title is lower; for
“sergeant” is from the low Latin “Serv
ians." moaning a servant
"Captain," we have considered: its
earlier form Is “capitan" and it is thus
in the Spanish. "Lieutenant” is "lo
cum tenens” —one who takes another s
place. The old English form was
“lleftenaunt,” and from that pronuncia
tion “leftenant” still lingers in Eng
land. "Major” is simply the Latin
word for "greater” and “mayor” is on
ly another form of the word in a dif
ferent application. "Colonel” is from
the Italian “colonnella,” meaning a lit
tle column. How the little col
umn or regiment, gave its name
to the commander thereof is some
what uncertain. "Cadet” is an Inter
esting word. It comes from the Gas
con "capdet" and means a little cap
tain, or the youthful member of a
"head Plain Deal
er.

New Auto Law In Effect
July Ist.
Many Changes Made of Interest
To Autoista.
The new law of the last session of the
Legislature regulating the operations of
motor vehicles in this State becomes
effective on June 1. Many changes were
made in the old law, and the measure
which was passed was agreed upon by
representatives of the Automobile Club
of Maryland, the State Roads Commis-1
sion and the Commissioner of Motor
Vehicles.
The revised law is State wide in its
effect. This means there will no longer ,
be a speed limit of six miles an hour in
one village and twelve miles in another,
but it means that if autoists can go 18 .
miles an hour in the outlying portions of
one city in the State, they can travel at , i
the same rate in the outlying portions of I
another city of the State. It also means j
that if they can go 25 miles an hour in I
the open country in one county, they can
go at that speed in every county in the
open country. 1
Pecuniarily the law means that if auto- ,
ists pay their taxes on their motor vehi
cles as personal property in the county
or city in which they reside and then pay
(heir operator’s fees and registration
fees to the Slate that is the end of all
f,,rms of taxes and charges for the privi
leges of operating cars anywhere in the
Sta' e
In reference to the registration fees,
•hinges were also made. At present
the motor vehicle of 1() hp pays $lO a
year and ih .t of 19 hp pays the sime.
Th- motor vehicle of 20 h. p. pays sls a j
year and that of 29 h. p. pays the same.
The owner of a light weight 23 h. p. car j
pays the same now for using the roads j
as the owner of a 29 h. p car weighing
nearly twice as much. Following the
lead of a number of other States, the
horsepower basis was determined upon
as the method of fixing the registration
charges, and the rate was accordingly
fixed at 50 cents per horse power. Five
dollars is the minimum charge for any '
car, no matter how low its horsepower
As somewhat counteracting the saving '
to tiie motorist from this reduction the
pfesent monthly schedule of registration
fees and refunds was abolished and a
quarterly schedule adopted. This was
partly for the conveniance of the Com
missioner of Motor Vehicles and partly
to counteract the loss of revenues from
the above reduction in charges. Under
this charge, anyone resistering his car
during January, February or March
would pay the fee for the entire year.
If during April, May or June, the fee
for the three-fourths of the year, and so
on by quarterly instead of monthly peri
ods. The same rule would hold as to the
registration certificates surrendered be
fore the expiration of the year.
In the case of solid tired motor vehicles,
chiefly motor trucks and other commercial
vehicles, the present charge is $3 per
year regardless of the size or weight of
such vehicle or the extent to which it
uses the roads. This charge it changed
so as to be as follows after June 1: 1 ton
truck $8; 2 ton truck sl4; 3 ton truck
S2O; 4 ton truck $26; 5 ton truck $32; 6
ton truck S3B; 7 ton truck $44.
The annual registration fee in the case
of motorcycles has been raised from SI.BO
to $3 per year. For dealers licenses the
charges under the new law are slightly
higher than under the old law, but the!
latter contained a number of restrictions ■
upon the dealer’s right to use his special
tags for other than clearly business pur
poses, and these restrictions have all
been abolished under the proposed law.
The only change made in the law rela
tive to operators' licenses is a reduction
in the charge for chauffer’s licenses
from $5 to $3 per year.
The speed limits remain as they are in
the present State law, and are applica
ble all over the State.
School House Breaking.
William Fogle, about 40 years old, and
a woman claiming to be his wife, were
arrested Tuesday by Deputy Sheriff
Koogle, rear the Frederick and Wash
ington county line, charged with break
ing into the Springfield school house,
near Catoctin Furnace, and stealing a
number of small articles. The pair was
taken to Middletown and turned oyer to
Deputy Sheriffs Klipp, of Frederick, and
Lidie, of Thurmont, and were taken to
Fn derick for a hearing. Fogle and his
wife are said to be roaming about with
no fixed place of abode.
Nearing Completion
During the past ten days linemen of
the C. & P. Telephone Co. have been
very busy in this place changing the
location of the exchange. Mo-e or less
incoivenience has been occasioned cus
tomers, but now everything is in fairly
good working order. The Misses Hobbs
have charge of the exchange.
Why Constipation Injures.
The bowels are the natural sewerage
system of the body. When they become
obstructed by constipation a part of the
1 poisonous matter which they should carry
off is absorbed into the system, making
you feel dull and stupid, and interfering
with the digestion and assimilation of
food. This cordition is quickly relieved
by Chamberlain’s Tablets. Obtainable
everywhere.

Oat-Smut Control.
County Agents Demonstrating
Value of Formalin Treatment
The treatment of seed oats with
formalin to prevent smut w becoming
more and more general, according to
reports of Ihe county .agents in tli i
North and West. In IDI d, TTOcoun- ;
ty agents reprrted, and of these I 16
succeeded in inducing farmers to a
dopt 'lids precaution. One hundred
and one of the agents hal between
them 2,56t fields or plats in which
they were giving demonstrations of
oat-smut control.
Many of the agents nude a pno
tiee of counting the smutted !tendß in
fields sown with treated an 1 untreated
seed in their respective c unities. The
average percents't • |P - om’ in the un
treated fi dds reported by 32mm was
II pr cent. Where the seed had
been treated, most of the agents rep >rt
ed that less than on ■ ’ df of 1 per
cent was founds n uted. a i l in sunn
eases none at all. Thenv rag‘increa
sed yields from th n- of treated seed
under the direction of *'i ■ ag-nls was
reported by oil m n to be a little more
than 8 bushels p mere. This is pro
bably larger than tin* yields that
would actually be obtained if all farm
ers treat'd their seed oats, since under
present conditions only those men do
so who have sufficient smut in their
fields to convince them uf the imp >r
tance of finding a remedy. llisdilli
cult to convince the average farm >r
that tlie loss from oat smut in his
field is likely to be as great as the p-r
cun tag i of smutty heads in any repre
entative area.
An interesting instance of tin; val
ue of the treatment is reported in Ill
inois. A fanner treated his seed oats ,
for lo acres and sowed I acres with j
untreated seed. The two pints, in I
which the other conditions were the j
same, were harvested and thrashed
separately. The treat d seed produc
ed o2 bushels per acre; the untreated,
3o bush ds. Po secure this gain of
!20 bushels an acre all that was nee
essary was an expenditure of from - r >
to 1U cents an acre for the l ihir and
material in treating the seed. In
this county in 1013 there wav only
2 farmers who treated their oats. In
I'Jlo there were about I,of):). In some
Illinois counties ha ving county agents
from 11 lo 60 per cent of the total
oats acreage was treated last year. —
Weekly News Letter.
Foot-And-Mj'Jth Over.
The long fight against the foot-and
mouth disease is over. The Secretary
of Agriculture has issued an order
which ou March 31 removed all foot
and-mouth quarantines and restrict
ions against the shipment and move
j ment of live stock. The order signed
j specifically removes the quarantine
| from a small territory in Christian
County, 111., the last area which was
under suspicion. Along with the re
moval of this local quarantine, the
various Federal orders restricting
shipment of cattle are rescinded, so
that dealers can now ship their cattle
as before the first quarantine was im
posed.
Upon notification that the United
States is free from the disease, all for
eign goverment which have placed
embargoes on American cattle art; ex
pected to remove these embargoes, s
that cattle raisers will then h table to
resume shipments to these foreign
countries.
The magnitude of the work of er
adication and control carried on by
fanners, shipp r, and the State and
Federal Goverments is shown by tlie
fact that controlled the disease had
gained a temporary footing in 22Sta
tes and the District of Columbia The
diseas' app ared at d was controlled in

| “Weary I
I Jimmy” |
| **** |
lb By Verda Rossiter 1
(Copyright, 1916, by W. G. Chapman.)
He was ragged, hungry, in Bore need
of a place to sleep, yet Weary Jim
took it all philosophically. Ho had
become inured to the law of averages
as to the liberal-heartedness of the
casual passing crowd. The benovo
leat-faced old men were the favorite
subjects of his mendicancy, but it was
late afternoon and that class of leis
ure bad long since gone homeward
bound.
"I'll wait till dark and tackle the
theater crowds,” decided Jim, and
picking up a flying scrap of newspa
per, selected some steps leading to
an unused basement and Idly ran his
eyes over the columns of the torn and
creased stray fragment.
"Hello!” exclaimed Jim suddenly,
and his eyes goggled and his hand
shook, and he read again the brief but
thrilling advertisement;
"Reward: A liberal reward will be
paid for information that will lead to
the discovery of James Newton, some
times known as ‘Weary Jim,’ and for
merly of the Little Jim Fisk restau
rant. Apply to Adam Sharp, Attor
ney, 12 Court building, or residence,
1194 Berry avenue.”
“That’s me!” gurgled in the throat
of Weary Jim. “Wanted —Reward!
And once 1 did work at that restau
rant and disgraced myself with tho
crowd for it, and drifted into tho
free-and-easy corps again. Lerame
see —are there any black marks
against mo that I’d be wanted for?
No, it's not that. 1 never touched a
cent that wasn’t my own—and never
■
ill 1 :' I m iThSh
To Do as I Like With?"
will. I’ll look up this advertisement
right away.”
Ono hour later Weary Jim sat in a
maze. He had called at the house In
Berry avenue, to be rebuffed by the
servant, to be bowed and scraped to,
almost hugged by Lawyer Adam
Sharp. The latter ushered Jim Into
his elegantly appointed library as
though he were some prince. He un
folded an astonishing story.
A distant relative, a halt uncle,
whom Jim, the last of the family Hue,
had long forgotten, had left to Jim his
entire fortune, viz.: $30,000 In cash, a
sumptuous residence, free and clear
of all incumbrance.
"You mean—you mean,” gasped Jim,
“that all —that —la—mine!”
"Unquallfledly," assented tho suave
attorney.
“To do as I like with?”
“Without bar or hindrance.”
"Now —right now, an advance, a
Blight advance,” pressed Jim anx
iously.
"Well, the banks are closed,” ex
plained Sharp, “and you will have to
go into court as a formality, but in the
meantime, if you will appoint me your
permanent legal representative in the
matter of tho estate, I will advance
you whatever you want.”
“Then gimme a dollar,” said Jim
eagerly.
“A dollar! My friend, you need a
great deal more than that Just to, ah!
ehem! rehabilitate yourself. I will
give you $100,” and ho produced tho
crisp inviting bank notes that made
Jim's mouth water. “I would suggest
a bath, a becoming suit of clothes, a
suite at a good hotel and 1 will meet
you at my oflice at ten o’clock to
morrow morning, go Into court and
place the estate cash of thirty thou
sand dollars to your account at the
bank. Ah, my dear,” he Interrupted
himself as an angular, vixen-faced
lady entered tho room, “let me have
the pleasure of Introducing Mr. New
ton—my daughter, Hyacinth.”
“Oh, dear,” piped the spinster lan
guidly, “have you found the gentle
man at last? How sweet! how roman
tic!” and she almost caressed this ex
pected—victim!
Weary Jim left the house like one
In a dream. One thing his more con
spicuous senses aimed for and land
ed. This was at a restaurant. The
meal Jim ate astounded the waiter. Its
volume so surprised the proprietoi
that he approached before it was fln-
Uhed and Intimated tho gross amount
Involved. Unctuous and full-mouthed,
Jim pulled out a flve-dollar bill.
“Give the change to the waiter,” bd
directed grandiloquently.
Ono week later, Weary Jim came
out of the mansion he had Inherited,
byway of the rear door and with a
scared look on his face. He almost
ran until ho readied a point some
squares distant.
“Whew!” lie panted, "I’m out of that
for good—l've escaped!”
What Jim had “escaped” from was
misery. For him wealth had brought
torment. A bath had made him ten
der and the flannels Irritated him.
Rich food gave him the toothache,
with consequent loss of appetite. He
missed the dozy atmosphere of the
hayloft and the cheap lodging house,
lying In his luxurious feather bed.
But the crowning terror of his
life had become Hyacinth—Hyacinth
Sharp, the attorney s daughter. Like
a wero-wolf she pursued him. She
was bound to many him—or rather
hla money. At the thought of this
tremendous responsibility Jim had re
solved to sacrifice all. He thought
of the happy-go-lucky life of old, and
then of her, and shuddered and—de
camped.
Jim had his plan. Long and dili
gently ho searched for an old partner
of the road—Crippled Joe. He found
his friend In a poor lodging house. Ho
astonished the helpless hobo comrade
with a proffer of homo, fortune,
friends. He tick Joe to a lawyer and
transferred to him legally all of his
uncle’s bequest except slo,oou in cash.
“Pocr fellow! I've put it over on
Joe!’’ murmured Jim, “but maybe
he’ll escape Hyacinth.”
Then Weary Jim plunged back Into
the old life. For a time, although the
frowsiest ct them all, he ran a free ho
tel for his compatriots, and expended
$5,000 in that philanthropic venture.
The result was a riotous household.
Increased Indolence on the part of his
patrons, and the police closed the
place.
One day Jim saw Cripple Joe and
the peerless Hyacinth flash by in an
auto. He knew they were man and
wife from the pained, furtive expres
sion on the face of Joe.
“Sold into slavery!” chuckled Jim,
and gloried in his rags and freedom.
The remaining $5,000 was a burden
to Jim. Us possession hurt his pride
as a dowu-and-outer. One day he took
a long tramp. It was to a place ho
had never forgotten, and the end of
liis pilgrimage landed him at the door
of a quaint, rustic cottage.
The place looked poor, and the love
ly young girl who came to the door
was nearly but plainly dressed. A
young man. her lover, just leaving her
was evidently a workman.
"I wanter to see Doctor Adams," ex
plained Jim, and his face fell as he
was informed that the physician had
been dead for several years, leaving
his family very poor.
"Such good men do,” said Jim sor
rowfully, and then he told how, 15
years before, the doctor had nursed
him through a two weeks' sickness —
he, a poor, homeless waif —and Jim
had never forgotten it.
Ho told a great lie as he placed his
$5,000 into the hands of the young
lady. He had made a fortune in a
mine and wore poor clothes so ho
would not be robbed. And then he
flitted away, leaving Rose Adams fair
ly astounded.
The time came when Weary Jim felt
ho was "all In.” “His uselessness was
over," as he comically put it. He was
up one day, down another. Somehow,
an indefinable longing sent him tramp
ing it to the cottage home of his dead
benefactor’s daughter.
It was dusk when he approached
the open window. Within the room
were husband and wife and a sweet
little girl In her night robe. She was
saying her prayers, and they ended
with;
"And, dear God, bless Mr. Newton,
who brought mamma and papa the
blessing of their life.”
At the sweet cherub In pure white
the old tramp gazed, then at his own
attire.
”1 won’t spoil the pretty picture,” he
said, and he went wearily to a shel
tered corner of the garden and lay
down and slept—and died.
Tims they found him, and tenderly
cared for the poor shell of a great
soul. And in the quiet village grave
yard there is a tombstone reading
simply: “Weary Jim—Tramp, at
Rest.”
The Modern Way.
‘What is your diagnosis, doctor?”
"Well. I find that you have a little
inflammation in the ears; your throat
Is slightly affected: your digestive
organs are not functioning properly,
and there is evidence of bronchitis."
"But can you lix me up?”
"Well, I advise that you go to Dr.
Tappem for your ears; across the
street you will And Dr. Swallow, who
is a throat specialist, and Dr. Pepsin
will undestand your digestive diffi
culties. As to your bronchitis, you
should see a good lung expert at
once.”
“But isn’t there anything the mat
ter with me that you can euro?”
“Yes, you have a $lO bill In your
wallet; I'll relieve you oi that."
The Dear Things.
This is the kind of stuff you hear
on the front porch:
“Why, George, how dare you? Now
you can just go right home, and don’t
you ever, ever speak to me again!”
George goes—as tar as the steps.
“Let me come back, please. I’ll be
good; honest, 1 will.”
■ “If you’re going to be good, there
Isn’t any reason for coming back.”
"Oh, you little angel!”
"George, dear, I can’t breathe.”-

Bed of Roses.
Every woman, young and old, knows

when, from sunrise till sunset, every
mortal thing seems to go wrong, no

them go right. For that matter, one
always does try harder on such days
than one the happy-go-lucky ones
when life flows on smoothly and har
moniously, like "a grand, sweet song.”
Goodness knows, there Is enough con
scientious effort wasted on a single
cross day to balance half a year of
ordinary days.
Why Is this? Is crossness a disor
dered state of the mind, or an over
wrought condition of the nerves, or
simply the reflection of an inexplicable
but unanimous “crossodness” on the
part of things in general? And if it
be any or all of these, is there any
way or overcoming it?
Crossness, like most other condi.
tions of life, is the inevitable effect of
a perfectly natural cause. Good hu
mor. like fine weather, cannot pos
sibly last forever. If it could, it would
inevitably become an intolerable bore.
Being eternally pleasant and agreeable
is all right theoretically, but it is a
terrific strain on the nerves.
It is dreadfully wearing, too, on
other people. Did you ever have to
live in the same house with somebody
who was always placid, always even
tempered, no matter who else was
worried and distraught? And were
you not sometimes seized with an un
holy yearning to do something per
fectly awful and fiendish, that you
might for once startle that hateful be
ing out of his or her maddening im
perturbability?
Music by Wireless.
A young California inventor has de
signed an apparatus whereby selec
tions played on a phonograph have
been transmitted to several neighbor
ing homes equipped with special re
ceiving instruments, Popular Mechan
ics Magazine states. In some in
stances the instruments have been
Installed in the dining room and by
tills arrangement the neighbors have
been entertained at mealtime. A
wireless telephone apparatus upon
which the inventor has been working
several years is used at his central
station. A phonograph, in which the
horn is an Integral part of the body
of the instrument, is used in producing
the selections. The slats are removed
from the mouth of the horn and with
in it are placed two ordinary telephone
transmitters, from which the sounds
are carried by wires to the wireless
telephone outfit which, after serving
as an amplifier, sends the waves
through a cable In the aerial on the
roof, whence they are discharged Into
the air.
The waves are caught by the varfc
ous receiving stations and conveyed
by wires to receivers each of which
is fitted with a small megaphone. In
several instances head appliances with
a pair of receivers were used. In oth
ers a single megaphone was sufficient
for a group of persons.
Zinc in War Time.
Zinc is so essential in war time
that it has risen enormously in price.
Costing originally only two-fifths as
much as copper, It now costs decided
ly more than copper, in spite of the
fact that copper itself has sharply
increased in value. Zinc is a, con
stituent of cartridge brass and shell
fuses, and is used also as a covering
for iron barbed-wire fencing. In 1913
the United States, Germany and Bel
gium were the leading producers of
zinc.
Of the three, only the United States
smelted domestic ores. Belgium and
Germany relied mainly on zinc con
centrates that they Imported from the
Broken liill mines in New South
IVales, where, for one reason and an
other, it does not pay to do the smelt
ing. France, Spain and Great Britain
also produce substantial quantities,
but not enough to supply their own
needs. Austria and Germany have
considerable deposits of ore in Silesia,
Hungary', ('arluthia and the Tyrol. As
the zinc-s-.ueltiug furnaces of Great
Britain arc not well adapted for deal
ing with the Broken Hill concentrates
it buys the bulk of Its supplies from
the United States.
