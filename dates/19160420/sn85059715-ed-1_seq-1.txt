EL PASO, Tex., April 20?The
growing belief that Francisco Villa
is dead, whether or not his body is
recovered, was strengthened Thursday
by messages received by American
mining concerns here from their
agents at Cusihuiriachic, Parral,
Santa Barbara and Guerrero.
All of these messages agreed that)
the report of Villa's death was common
among the peons in northern j
Chihuahua and was generally accepted
as true. One very circumstantial i
I story sent to the head of a mining
concern operating In the Guerrero1
I rila+flnt Vln Vf 1
xuuivt uj ma .ut-Aiuuii Huyenuiendent
was positive that Villa had been
! buried in the neighborhood of San !
Francisco Borga. the hamlet where i
the grave of the bandit has been re-1
ported found.
Fears are openly expressed by the
army officers that should an order
to withdraw the American troops and
other marauding bands will raise the
cry that the 'American troops are in
retreat with the result that American
I soldiers will be subject to constant
night attacks and sniping as they retiro
from Mexico.
To prevent such warfare against
his columns. General Pershing is pre-,
paring to be in a position to move
his farces in largo units.
The belief is general at Fort Bliss'
that the troops will encounter more:
difficulties in a withdrawal from Mexico
than they did on their rapid 40n,
mile drive from Columbus to Parral.

MORE STROP
OF GOSP1

By Evangelist Sam Hawkins in t
the Revival at the Central J
Christian Church. t
i i
The theme of the sermon delivered t
by tho Rev. Mr. Hawkins to an ap- c
preciauve aauience at the Central 11
Christian church last night was "The 1
Son of God." Ho highly maintained c
the high standard set the night before
on the subject. "The Word of e
God." t
The speaker assumed that' the I
proposition of the night before had g
been fairly maintained, viz: That t
the Bible Is the Word of God. On c
tnat basis he demonstrated In an I
overwhelmingly conclusive manner r
that Jesus Is the Son of God. He r
made impressive the fact that more a
depends upon the truth of the propo- h
sltlon that Jesus is the Son of God C
than upon any other proposition a
that could be named. Destroy that J
and the Bible Is proven a false book; I
the church Is an Institution with an r
Imaginary head, and every Christian 1
hope is without substance. t:
He called attention to the different t
titles by which Jesus Is designated In ti
the Bible?Son of Abraham, Son of 1]
Dayld, Son of JoBeph, Son of Mary,
Son of Man, and Son of God. b
He stated that the casual reader fl
of the Bible attaches no special 1m- n
porlance to these titles. He electrl- c.
fled his audience by declaring In a o
dramatic manner that If it could be n
shown that Jesus was not the son a
of Abraham or the Son of David, that C
he would never preach another aer- T
^ mon. He defended this statement on S

Is Being Billed to Be Shown in
the City of Clarksburg
Thursday, May 4.
The old saying, "see one circus and
you have seen them all," does not ap?
ply to the performance presented by
the Sparks circus this season.
A feature that is entirely new in this
country and that stands out as a distinct
novelty, is the wonderful per- J
formance of Henri Mordette, "the man
who walks upon his head."
This wonderful exhibition of skill!
and daring consists in bounding up j
and down stairways balanced upon his
head, with no support other than the 1
contact of his head with the steps. The
fine balance that must be maintained
to accomplish this feat can only be
appreciated after seeing this wonderful
act accomplished.
This novelty will positively be seen
at each performance of the Sparks i
circus, which will be here Thursday,,
May 4. s j

he ground of the promises of God In
he covenant made with Abraham 1
ind of the promise made to David t
hat "of his loins he would raise <
ip a son to sit on his (David's) r
hrone." He stated that any Jew on 1
arth today could rightly claim to n
>e a son of Abraham, but that no i
lvng Jew would prove himself a son
if David.
Ono feature of the Bermon which
illcited much comment of appreciates
was the explanation of the ap- c
inrent discrepancies between the i
;eneology of Christ In the first chap- t
er of Matthew and the third chapter t
If Luke. He stated that Tom I 1
-nine in nis "Age of Reanon" had t
nade this apparent, though to him 1
eal dlecrepancey, one of his strong t
rguments against the Bible. Matt- r
ew gives the paternal geneology of
Ihrist and Luke gives the maternal
nceBtry of Christ. Both Mary and
OBeph were descendants of David,
lowever, no drop of David's blood j,
,-as in the Christ through Joseph.
'be blood relationship to David was ?
hrough Mary, his mother. While j

Whether all German consuls and

discussed by state department officials.
It was stated that a rupture would not
necessarily extend to consuls although
diplomatic customs generally included
such officials.
Explaining the expression In the
United States note regarding severing
relations "altogether" It was officially

this government's intentions to
make any break complete by the recall
ot Its ambassador and consuls and request
the recall of Germany's diplomatic
and consular ofHlcals. It was
said that In some diplomatic breaches
the nation taking the Initiative had recalled
Its ambassadors without dismissing
the foreign envoy accredited

break occurs with Germany both Ambassadors
Bcrnstorff and Gerard undoubtedly
would bo affected.
